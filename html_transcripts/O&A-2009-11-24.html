FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, my peoples, it's Spider Harrison, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and  Anthony, hosted by primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock.  And check me out on the Serious Hits One Weekend Countdown every weekend on Serious  Hits One on the weekend, duh. 
[00:00:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, I am E-Rock, and he is Sam.  You're E-Rock?  I'm E-Rock.  And you're Sam?  I thought you were Derek.  No, Derek left.  There's so many of you, I get you all confused.  But E-Rock, Bobby Lee is one of our favorite people to have in studio.  This was the first time we've ever had Bobby Lee in studio.  Jimmy had talked about him for a while, he's well known on the West Coast and MAD TV.  So he's in New York, we get him on, and some strange things started to happen.  Well, he only comes on our show once a year, and it's because of this we just completely 
[00:01:00]  mess with his brain.  In this first part, he's visiting the show, and we're just getting to know Bobby Lee, and  he's explaining to us how he suffers from a severe paranoia due partly to multiple years  of drug use, which he's now sober, and partly because he's out of his mind insane.  Well, here's Bobby Lee.  We get down to some of his psychological problems on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to The Worst. 
[00:01:30]  It sucks a pile of cotton.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, shit.  We've got to say hi to Bobby Lee.  He's just pacing out there.  Is he here?  Where is he?  Bobby, what are you doing out there?  Oh, I didn't even know.  Just by the coffee machine or something?  I wouldn't drink that coffee.  No one has drank that coffee in months, Bobby.  I thought that was Bobby Lee, and then I started questioning how much I can differentiate  Asians.  Bobby, what are you doing?  We'll get you some Starbucks. 
[00:02:00]  Don't drink that coffee.  We just tripped.  Why are you tripping?  How are you doing, man?  He's doing a fucking Dick Van Dyke entrance.  Pull up a comfy chair.  Hey, how are you?  How are you?  How come Mike didn't get a hug?  That was the all-great chair, man.  That was the all-great chair, man.  That was the all-great chair, man.  That was the all-great chair, man.  Bobby Lee gave a hey and a really good hug to Robert Kelly, a hey and a really good  hug to Jimmy, and then just looked at Mike and went, hey. 
[00:02:30]  Mike, you want a hug, man?  No, it's not.  No, I can do it right now, dog.  Why didn't you?  No, it's cool.  It's done, man.  The moment's over.  But it was funny, because Mike's arm went out in hug mode.  And then he put it in a handshake.  You know, you fucking revised history.  That did not happen.  That would have been hilarious if it happened, but it's not what happened.  No, you gave me, like, nom eyes, you know what I mean?  Like, when I was a nom, right, and then you were going to stab me or something.  And I know these two, you know what I mean?  Oh, you guys don't know each other?  No, no, no, I mean, no, I'm a fan. 
[00:03:00]  I just, you know what I mean?  It was awkward.  I'm sorry.  I'm a fan?  What the heck happened?  What the fuck is that?  Should I start over?  You guys have beers.  What are we in Hollywood?  You just say, I'm a fan to everybody?  Hey, I'm a fan.  Hey, look, I'm just a fan.  Dude, that is so true about Hollywood.  Everybody's a fucking fan, and then behind each other's backs, you just stab each other.  You see some obscure soap opera star on Sunset Boulevard.  Hey, I'm a fan.  I've never seen your work.  I've just seen your picture in a couple magazines. 
[00:03:30]  Big fan.  You're running into Rod Stewart.  Big fan.  All the albums.  Yeah.  Big fan of your stomach contents, Rod.  Thank you so much.  Is that it?  Am I gone now?  There you go.  They're telling us that Bobby has to go.  If anyone wants to know who Bobby is, he's the Asian guy on Mad TV.  That no one watches?  No one watches the Asian guy?  No, the show.  What's wrong with you, Mike?  No, everyone says it's still Bobby.  I love Bobby.  Dude, he made good in him. 
[00:04:00]  I like Mad TV.  Really?  Yeah.  I want you a hug, dude.  Hold on.  Name one skit from Mad TV.  Yeah, you're a fan, right?  Yeah, I like the girl who does the Asian lady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's gone.  She's been gone for eight years.  I like the guy who's been gone for eight years.  I don't like Mad TV.  But he's a fan.  He's a fan.  I'm not a fan.  He's a huge fan.  I'm not a fan of the show you're on.  When it first started, it was fucking great.  That sucks.  Yeah, Mike.  How long has that show been on?  We're going to our 14th year. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  It's on Comedy Central all the time now, right?  I can't believe you just try to play it off like you're a fan.  I am.  And then they ask for one sketch.  The girl left nine years ago.  I like the new guy, the black guy who delivers the stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  Name me a character that I do, Robert.  I like when you play the girl.  Any Asian girl you play, you just look like a guy.  Like what?  Name one.  Name me one Asian girl character.  Ming Lao?  I don't know.  He was just trying to stick up for Bobby.  Thank you, Robert.  Bobby's hilarious.  I'm just saying.  It's not a well-viewed show.  Yeah, it does okay, though. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, it's not like we get like nine Mexicans and that's wow.  At least his show is viewed.  He can't stop.  No, watch it.  Jesus.  Wow.  Hey, hold on, Bob.  That was a real slam by Bob because Mike's got a very sensitive spot.  He did a CBS pilot, which was supposed to be very good, but they rejected it.  And Bob just made fun of him saying that at least yours gets viewed.  So that's kind of a soft spot.  Well, you know, I probably should stay out of this because I don't have anything going on.  I'm at the cellar this weekend, Friday and Saturday night, three shows, four shows.  And also, Michael Hitchcock did do my show. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  He's on Mad TV.  He played the veterinarian on my show.  Yeah, yeah.  I love how not in the industry that Bobby is that he says my pilot got canceled.  As though we're even on.  My pilot got canceled.  As though we're on TV in the first place.  I just admitted that.  Well, Mike's pilot got canceled.  What are you, a fucking impressionist now, jackass?  He rode a value jet on it and dropped it in the fucking front of everybody.  You do one good impression of his girlfriend and then you think you can just whip it around?  I like the new Mike Birbigley. 
[00:06:00]  I think he's been brushing up on the O&A culture.  He's a mean motherfucker today.  Come in here and fucking bare your teeth.  My friend Mike sincerely said it was amazing.  Hitchcock, yeah.  He said that you were very funny.  He's a talented guy.  He's the guy in Best in Show.  He was, no, Michael Hitchcock.  Which guy in Best in Show?  He played Parker Posey's husband in Best in Show.  Fuck yeah.  The braces.  Hysterical.  I like your mustache.  Fuck yeah.  Thanks, dude.  Yeah, I'm going for the 70s porn look.  Yeah, I can't grow anything, man.  70s coming back. 
[00:06:30]  It is coming back.  With a vengeance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trying to get AIDS.  Doing everything.  My show is loosely based on the period of my life like many years ago.  Not his.  Was.  What?  Not his.  Was.  Shut up.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Mike Turner's just like, what?  I'm just saying.  I love to do my stuff.  So the listeners know.  Just because people hear your voice saying boring shit doesn't mean they're going to buy  more of your albums, Bobby.  I'm just saying, Mike. 
[00:07:00]  Please.  I'm just saying.  Mike.  Jim, to answer your question that you asked me.  I'm just saying, Mike.  I'm just saying it's is.  Are you serious?  I'm just saying.  You're going to keep going with this babbling shit?  I'm just saying.  That's all.  That's all.  My, Jim, was I just saying?  Yeah.  Just saying.  I don't know why you're getting so angry, Mike.  Awkward.  Yeah, you get very angry real quick.  What's wrong?  Not angry.  Hey, don't do that psycho smile.  Maybe because Mike was in the middle of saying something.  Don't do that psycho I'm angry smile.  Maybe because Mike was in the middle of saying something and you decided to just chime in  over him.  Oh, so I'm sorry.  That's the way the show works.  He talks. 
[00:07:30]  Then you talk.  Then I talk.  Nobody just jumps in and says funny shit.  Don't fuck yourself, you thin guinea.  No.  See, funny shit is really subjective.  Hey, sometimes it's funny.  Sometimes it's not.  You're a fat guinea.  I'm Irish.  You look like a guinea.  How are you saying you're Irish?  He's adopted by Irish people.  I know.  So you're not Irish.  You're lucky to be fucking Italian.  You're probably Puerto Rican.  Colin said that my great, great grandmother got raped on the Khyber Pass.  The Khyber Pass. 
[00:08:00]  It's a fucking Colin.  Exactly.  Colin.  That's Colin.  Colin said my favorite slam of Bobby was Colin said Bobby should be dancing in a grass  skirt entertaining Australian tourists.  No, he's saying, I don't know, whatever.  What about the one?  Did I say it wrong?  Yeah, he said it wrong.  He said I look like, I look, I look, oh, go ahead.  What's the other one he said about him in a gift shop?  That's the one.  He mixed it up.  That's what he said.  That's what you get from a gift shop.  No, that's the new one.  But what was the other one? 
[00:08:30]  The last minute gift at an airport coming back from Hawaii.  No, it wasn't.  Colin was dressed in the grass skirt for the Halloween show.  And then I said the grass skirt was actually his Comedy Central contract that they shredded.  Yeah, but he did say you should be dancing to make Australian tourists happy.  And like a tongue in the tongue and something.  It was very funny.  The last minute gift in a gift shop coming back from China.  There you go.  I'm going to have to read it off of a teleprompter. 
[00:09:00]  Last minute gift.  Can we get back to my friend?  To answer your question, Jim.  Thanks, Bobby, for the interruption.  Jesus, you're still on there, you little fucking angry cunt.  Just go.  Just say it.  Say it.  Just say it.  I'm right here.  It's this period of my life where I was living with my girlfriend, my girlfriend at the time.  And I knew she wanted to get married, but it was this unspoken thing.  And then we went to my brother's wedding, and they asked us to be in a photo.  And they said, do you want Abby in the photo? 
[00:09:30]  And I said, yes.  But there was like this pause.  You look like you're going to cry.  Oh, it's a true story.  It's real, you know.  Your pause freaked her out?  Yeah, and then we got home that night.  We were living together, and she goes, you know, is this serious?  And I was like, yeah, of course it's serious.  I love you.  And she was like, you know, are we going to get married?  And I was like, yeah.  And then she was like, when?  And what I should have said was, can we talk about this next summer?  And what I did say was, next summer.  And then she called everyone we knew and told them we were getting married.  And that's how I got engaged without getting engaged. 
[00:10:00]  And so the sitcom is actually about this wedding that's never going to happen.  And you know it's not going to happen.  And everybody, and the people watching knows it's not going to happen, but she doesn't know.  What was the name of the show?  It was the Untitled Mike Birbiglia Project.  Who played the chick?  This girl, Christine Woods, who's on Kelsey Grammer's pilot, which might go this fall.  She's real talented.  And, like, Bob Odenkirk played my brother.  And, you know, Mike Hitchcock played the vet. 
[00:10:30]  And, like, it was, like, the mother from Six Feet Under played my mom.  It was, like, pretty surreal working with all these people.  So, yeah, that's all I got.  Were they hard on you, like the producers and stuff?  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to make it.  That's why I'm doing a one-person show in New York this fall, because it's my show.  And I get to decide what's in the show versus television, where people just, it's like someone trying to find a vein in you at the hospital.  And you're just poking you, and you're like, ah, okay. 
[00:11:00]  You know, you're just taking it.  Does that analogy make sense at all?  Yes, it reminds me.  It's like, I like to do, that's why I like the freedom of stand-up.  Like, my new CD, Edgy As I Wanna Be.  Edgy As I Wanna Be.  Edgy As I Wanna Be.  Let's go.  Bobby, how many years have you been on?  I'm not interviewing.  I'm just curious.  What?  How many years have you been on MTV?  I've been, this is my eighth year.  Damn, man.  Dude, this is it.  After this, I'm dead.  You're done?  Yeah.  I'm, like, dead in the business.  Has anyone been on the whole time?  No.  Caliendo's gone, right? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, Caliendo left.  Everyone wants to leave once they're there.  Does he still have his own sitcom on CBS?  I just did a pilot myself, but I don't see.  Oh, you did?  It's not gonna get picked, no.  Why would I get picked?  It's, like, weird.  What is it?  It's just, like, a lot of Asians dancing around naked and stuff.  It's not, it's too weird.  You and Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken?  Yeah, Steve Byrne's, like, fully Asian.  He's, like, a light Mexican kind of looking.  His father looks like, his father's real Irish.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the Carlos Mencia of Asians.  Oh!  We're gonna bring that up?  Please don't bring that up.  Let's say hi to John in Illinois.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:12:00]  I saw you on that video.  The radio, the video thing with him and Rogan, that thing comes up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, not on this show, my friend.  You put it on the spot.  You guys are classy.  You put it on the spot.  But you brought it up.  I did.  Why did I bring it up?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Didn't you just bring it up?  I did.  I think I just did.  I didn't.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you brought it up.  Let's just move on, please.  Hey, Bobby, you got anything boring to say?  This would be a good time for that.  Now, if Bobby had one ounce of fucking wit, he would have said, yes, Mike for Big Mac.  God damn you, Bobby. 
[00:12:30]  Thanks for helping, though.  So, Robert, the reason why I play girls on the show is because it's a parody show.  There's not a lot of Asian dudes out there.  So, whenever there's a girl, I got to play that girl, the Asian girl.  No, I love when you play Asian girls.  You're actually cute.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, you play her real well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In fact, if I was a chick, I'd get laid more.  Do Asian guys really have a problem getting pussy?  Because Asian women can, Asian women fuck, and I talked to a couple of Asian guys about 
[00:13:00]  that.  Asian women will fuck black guys, white guys, Spanish guys.  Yeah.  But white girls won't fuck Asian guys.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Really?  That's absolutely not true.  So, you bang white girls?  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  Do you bang Asian girls?  I bang all kinds of girls.  And the reason why, here's what it is.  It's this.  You got to do a launching pad.  And what a launching pad is, is I tell Asian dudes that haven't been laid, you get a prostitute  first.  Right?  And that gets your, you know, your shit moving.  Right?  And the girls sense that you're having sex.  And then they're in the game.  Every guy that I send to a prostitute to, they get laid. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the prostitute.  Plus, I lose $300.  I know you're paying.  Yeah.  No, I mean, after.  After.  Because they get into the, you know, the routine of it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes it takes 30 times.  Wow.  You go to Tijuana.  Right?  It's $60.  You go to Adelita.  Tijuana's disgusting.  Just listen, Robert.  I went to Tijuana and the girl had a white nougat on her asshole.  And then she turned around and goes, go ahead.  If you want to, go ahead. 
[00:14:00]  Lick it.  I was like, I almost puked.  You know me.  What was it?  I like when they bring out the Bob Kelly with a bridle and have it fuck one of the women  on stage.  Oh.  It was actually called a health club.  Really?  Yeah, it was a health club, but they had two dumbbells and a thigh master.  That's what they had.  Very good.  Heard that, Jimmy.  Hey, let's go back to Bobby Lee.  Let me explain what you did.  But I also think the Asian dudes, right, they're like, a lot of them are conservative and stuff.  And they, you know, they're doctors and they're in computers and stuff like that. 
[00:14:30]  And you have those Asians and then you have my kind of Asians.  I think those kind, you know, the kind of drug addicts and the, you know what I mean?  Opium guys, you know?  I think we kind of get girls.  So you go down to Tijuana to what place again?  Adelita and Chicago Club.  Yeah.  It's on Coahuila Street.  You know, they're across the street from each other.  And then back of Adelita, there's a place called Hooker Alley where all the underage  girls lean up against the wall.  Do they arrest you for that in Mexico?  Do they set you up and arrest you?  I'm surprised they don't buy people.  No, no, no.  They don't. 
[00:15:00]  And you walk down, you don't, I mean, if you go down Hooker Alley and you grab a girl,  you're going to hell.  Because those girls are too young.  But, like, I've walked down it.  For who?  What?  Too young for who?  Yeah, exactly.  What are you talking about?  Mexican.  It's another country.  It's the metric system.  That's right.  She's six killiers.  Let's go to John in Illinois.  John.  Hey.  Hey.  What's happening, fellas?  First of all, Opium Anthony, I just want to thank you for everything that you've exposed 
[00:15:30]  me to.  Aunt Kane, Jim Norton, Rich Boss, Lucky Louie.  I saw you, Jimmy, in Chicago in April.  You were friggin' fantastic at the Lakeshore Theater.  Thank you.  Hotter than hell.  Thanks.  Yeah, well, yeah, it was very warm.  Huge fan, man.  I just, I love you guys so much.  I listen to you every day.  Right.  Get to the point.  Not enough.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah.  I think he's an awesome comedian.  The favorite skit that I like on Mad TV is when he was Tank.  Oh, Tank.  I was from the club pimping in his day wound. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys rock, man.  Thanks a lot.  Take care, bro.  All right, John.  There was a distinct omission of me in that phone call, and I'm not going to point it out,  but...  What happened?  Well, he just kind of went around the room and complimented everybody.  All right.  And said nothing.  But I like that, I like the day wound.  I like the sound of that.  I love the new Burbiglia, man.  Don't you do that bit with the guy that looks like Mark Wahlberg there on the show? 
[00:16:30]  Which one?  Do you mean Ike Barinholtz?  Who's the guy that looks like Mark Wahlberg?  Mike Ike.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He left.  He left the show.  Eight years ago, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I love how we're all trying to prove that we watch his show.  No, we're proving we all watch it on Comedy Central.  No, nobody watches the show.  I realize I'm a part of a loser show, but it's just like, what am I going to do?  I don't think anybody watches it first run, but I think we've all seen it on Comedy Central.  Yeah, that's why, you know.  And you're a hilarious dude.  No one's criticizing your credibility as a comedian. 
[00:17:00]  I understand.  Thank you.  Here comes the hug.  Hey, where's the hug?  That was the hug.  What the fuck?  What the hug?  Is there a experience going on?  No.  How many years was he on?  He was on for eight, too.  How long has he been gone?  He's been gone for like three years.  Let me tell you something.  That dude didn't say hi to me for three years.  We're all trying.  Yeah, I heard you had problems.  Didn't you have problems when you first got on the show?  Like they treated you like shit?  Dude, I showed up on the show and literally,  producers would say,  Dude, we're going to do everything we can to get you off the show.  Why? 
[00:17:30]  Because they're like,  We don't know.  You're not from Sketch.  You've never acted before.  We think that, you know what I mean?  Stand-ups don't work on the show.  And literally, that first two years,  that's why I went to rehab my second year,  because I was just drugged out.  I hate those fucking...  Sketch people have this fucking arrogance.  Some of them are brilliantly funny.  But they have...  You know, I've had enough of these motherfuckers.  They have this arrogance.  They do Sketch, these faggots,  because they can't stand alone on a stage most.  They have a fucking resentment.  Against stand-ups.  And again, Sketch people,  I have respect for it,  because what they do is an art,  and it's hard. 
[00:18:00]  But their resentments of stand-ups  make me want to fucking spit in their faces.  Fuck you when you're fucking  needing somebody else up there.  Stand by yourself.  Is that a...  Are we cutting a commercial?  What is that?  I've heard that shit before.  They have this resentment against stand-ups.  Dude, and whenever I go up by myself  in front of a live audience,  I get off,  and all the sketchbook guys are like,  you seem very comfortable on stage.  Yeah, I'm a performer.  Yeah.  Like, I'm not afraid of them.  Yeah.  I don't have to pretend I'm in an office.  What was the drug that got you into rehab? 
[00:18:30]  I started drinking Vicodin, man.  Vicodin?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I started taking like 20 of them,  25 of them a day.  I started drinking, yeah.  How often did you not shit?  You must have not shit.  I tell you, the last...  Okay, two days before my last sketch,  I quit doing Vicodin,  and I had to play Connie Chung.  And this is...  Everyone knows, right?  So I'm in Connie Chung,  and I'm detoxing, right?  I'm in front of a live audience,  and I'm shaking, right?  The lights come on.  The director goes,  all right, action.  I go, good evening.  I'm Connie.  And then I shit my pants.  I shit my pants, right?  And then they go, cut.  And all the wardrobe come out, 
[00:19:00]  and they're cleaning the shit  off my nylons and stuff.  How'd they know you shit?  They heard it?  No, dude, you could smell it.  And I'm sweating,  and I'm shaking.  Then one of the producers,  Dick Blasucci,  walks up to me,  starts screaming at me.  He goes,  you're gonna do it!  You're gonna finish it!  Because the next day  I was going to rehab, right?  It took me two hours  to do a three-minute sketch.  They did it line by line  in front of 300 people.  Is that...  Can we watch that?  Is that out there?  Yeah, it's out there.  Just to know that you shit your pants?  There's an edited...  That aired.  But you can literally... 
[00:19:30]  It's the worst sketch I've ever done.  Let's get it on TV.  Let's get it up here.  Hey, Bobby,  I'm a fan of when you shit your pants,  by the way.  Thank you.  That sketch where you shit your pants.  I'm a fan.  When I had a...  Remember when I had that bad toothache  and I went upstairs  to the dentist up there?  I do remember, yes.  And he wrote me a prescription  for Vicodin.  And I got it,  went home,  and I took one.  And the second it hit me,  the first thing I did  was count how many I had left.  I was like,  one, two, three...  Okay.  That's amazing.  If I break one in half, 
[00:20:00]  and then I'll have more,  and that shit is great.  How good is it for...  Because I've got to get  sinus surgery in August.  I don't know what they're  going to give me for pain,  but I'm going to have  to take something.  Don't take it.  Yeah.  I have to.  You should.  Yeah, you're going to take it,  but don't...  I'm an addict to recovery.  I'm going to murder.  You're an addictive personality.  Having my septum fucking straight  and interbinate shake.  I took it when I took my knee,  and I went through the shakes.  I'll take whatever they give me  for medicinal.  I have to.  I'm going to murder.  You need St. Joseph's baby aspirin.  What do you take for pain?  That's the only thing you can take 
[00:20:30]  because you're an addictive personality.  You love everything.  I throw them out before  the prescriptions are done.  No, no.  I don't fuck with prescriptions.  No?  But when you have surgery,  you've got to take it.  I'm not going to suffer  and not take...  What, over-the-counter painkillers?  Well, what do some addicts  do in your case?  Most of them will take  the prescribed amount only.  Take the pain!  Take the pain!  You take the prescribed amount only,  and you maybe have somebody  help you out with it  and give it to you  if you're married,  or you fucking just throw them out.  Like, I always throw them out  when the pain stops  as opposed to the pill.  Are there people 
[00:21:00]  that refuse all pain medications  because they're too scared?  I won't.  I don't know.  Maybe.  You don't help with witnesses,  but I don't fuck with that.  Yeah, Mormons and...  Well, you call your sponsor.  That's what I would do.  Yeah, you have to do that.  Christian scientists.  Yeah, somebody, yeah.  I'm not going to suffer  through fucking post-surgical pain.  No one ever expects you to do that.  Of course not.  Let's go to Kathy in South Carolina.  Kathy.  That's a tough nut.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hi, Kath.  Talking about Vicodin  and all sorts of shit.  Yes.  Waiting for Mike Birbiglia  to hit somebody, you know.  We've got to get one right now.  This is a good one. 
[00:21:30]  I've got a front seat  to Madness.  Bobby Lee's skits.  Uh-oh.  What, baby?  My skits?  Bobby Lee's skits.  Yeah?  I'm here.  I like 24.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you very much.  He hasn't done that skit  in five years.  No, no, no, no, no.  I do like two a year.  But thank you.  Yeah, I watch the new ones  that come on.  I don't watch the reruns.  Do you like them or no?  Oh, I watch that  instead of Saturday Night Live.  Oh, thank you.  That's a compliment.  What's your name, miss? 
[00:22:00]  Kathy.  We're glad you watched the show,  but on the phone  you're a real snooze fest.  I'm sorry.  I'm just kidding.  I'm from South South.  I guess that's what,  you know, we're like.  All right.  Hey, so nobody, Bobby,  nobody was nice to you  when you got there?  No, no, no.  It was the worst  two, three years of my life.  And then what happened was  then like, you know,  fans started going,  we like the little guy,  you know what I mean?  And then all of a sudden  it kind of changed.  And also the old people left  and then when the new people  came in, then I was like.  You were there.  Yeah, I was already there 
[00:22:30]  and then you have  a little power and stuff.  But dude, the first two years,  I literally was going to  Virginia Tech the whole place.  Aries didn't see Heidi  for three years?  No.  Are you friends with her now?  Oh, no, yeah, I see him  and then he grows my head.  Oh, is that the bit?  Yeah, let's go.  Let's watch this.  It's on YouTube.  Is this the one?  Wow.  I don't know if that's it.  It's Connie Chung  and Joe Millionaire.  That's hilarious.  Is that the one?  No, no, no.  Aries and Moe were in it.  I don't think it's on YouTube,  but that's me.  Everything's on YouTube.  Have they ever, 
[00:23:00]  on Mad TV,  have they ever considered  casting Alfred E. Newman  as an actor?  Is that funny?  Please hold me.  Dude, we have nothing  to do with that magazine.  Oh, you don't?  No, I mean,  they bought the rights  to the name,  but then like,  all that other stuff.  I didn't even know that.  I was just going to use it  as a platform  for my bad jokes.  Let's say hi to Elizabeth  in Philly.  Elizabeth, what's up? 
[00:23:30]  Hey.  Hey, hi.  Jimmy,  my mother-in-law  just had this surgery  on her sinuses  and for like two weeks  afterwards,  she sounded like a whistle.  It was pretty funny.  Ah, it's the moments  like that, right?  And happy birthday, baby.  Thank you.  Ooh, she called you baby.  She sure did.  Is your mother breathing  better though,  your mother-in-law?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that again?  Is your mother-in-law  breathing better?  I think so.  I really can't stand her.  I wish she would  stop breathing, 
[00:24:00]  but yeah,  she is breathing.  Wow, the little dirt  comes out, huh?  Yeah, so I hope  you can do one  at your surgery, babe.  Thank you, ma'am.  All right, let's see.  All right.  You're a fucking mensch.  Well, she's better now.  Hope you old cunt  was killed  by a drunk driver.  Yeah, I was going to call  and say, Bobby Lee,  you're a fucking genius, man.  Oh, thanks.  My favorite skit  is Average Asian.  Uh-huh.  That shit is hilarious.  Thank you. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Well, Average Asian  was one of those things.  It was during the time  when no one liked me.  So that was the only thing  that they would give me  is this thing called  Average Asian  where I, you know,  like stereotypes would come up  and I'd be like,  I don't know what's going on,  you know.  But thank you very much.  How many weeks  a year do you guys shoot?  Do you want an episode  a week for how many weeks?  Well, it used to be 22  and now it's only 14.  This year they gave us  only 14.  It's done after this year.  I cannot see it coming back.  Really?  Yeah.  Literally, dude,  there's homeless people  sleeping outside my dressing room.  There's no security.  I don't even know 
[00:25:00]  what's going on.  I can't even get in,  you know.  Wow, it sounds like XM.  You know,  you would have done  really well in the 80s  during that period  where there's always  an Asian character in movies  like in Real Genius  because of like  the Asian guy  who lives in the dorm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who makes it like  a skating rink  in the hallway.  That's a great movie.  Does your money drop?  No, that's why  go do it.  That's the only reason  why I do it.  You know,  it's just because  they go,  here's this  and I'm like,  all right,  I'll take it.  Are you still doing 
[00:25:30]  the Kims of comedy?  No, they kicked me  out of the group.  They kicked you out?  They kicked you out?  What's the Kims of comedy?  Steve Burns group.  Yeah, it's all Asians  that tour the country.  Yeah, well,  it was mine  and then I got kicked out  and now it's Steve.  Who kicked you out?  Why?  Well, me and Steve  are very good friends  and I love them  but I wouldn't do like,  you know,  they were doing this.  Do you like the fact  that his hair  looks like a Lego person?  That fucking hairdo  should be removed  by Azra.  Horrendous.  I wouldn't do this  like,  you know, 
[00:26:00]  this college showcase  for free.  You know how they do  those,  what do they call them?  Nackas?  Nackas?  Yeah.  You've got to fly for free  to showcase  and I'm like,  we're not doing that.  You know what I mean?  We proved that we can sell out.  You know what I mean?  Why would we have to showcase?  And that was the reason  you left the group?  No,  they were like,  well,  if you don't do the showcase  then you can't reap  the benefits  of us doing,  you know,  getting the gigs  from the show.  Aren't you the biggest name  though being on TV  so wouldn't your name  on the bill  be a benefit  that they couldn't contribute  because who else  is on it?  Yeah,  someone could just  throw money for your flight.  Who cares?  I know,  but the thing is 
[00:26:30]  is that now,  but now I talked to Steve  three days ago  and you know,  we're going to do  some days again.  Who else is on it?  Steve and who else?  Dr. Ken,  you know him?  Dr. Ken's really funny.  He's very funny.  And this kid named  Kevin Shane,  nobody knows him.  I know Kevin.  I love him.  I know Kevin.  He's the best.  What do you think of  people getting in trouble  for doing stereotypical humor?  Bobby Lee.  Dude,  like I used to be  Mencia's opening act  so it's just like  that's how I was raised  to seeing that kind of stuff  so I don't really know.  Seeing what kind of stuff.  It's weird because  it's like now  like there's a lot  of New York guys  that move to L.A. 
[00:27:00]  and I've learned more  from them,  like guys like Bill Burr  than I have from L.A. comics.  You know what I mean?  Because you know,  it's like sitting there  it doesn't have,  you don't have to have  a punchline  and before like I,  you know,  I was so worried  about killing,  you know what I mean?  Like Mencia does  that now it's like  I'd rather just kind of  take my time  and be more honest  and stuff,  you know?  What do you learn from Bill?  How to repress  childhood memories  and not bite the face  of people around you?  No, dude,  it was good.  Yeah, Bill Burr,  we love him. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, what a psycho.  Bill.  I ask that  because Richard Bills  are disappointed  the hell out of me.  I was watching  The Last Comic Standing.  I literally watched  like two episodes  and I caught this one  where there was  a Korean woman.  Yeah, Esther Koo.  Doing all Korean humor,  getting huge laughs  and they had no problem  with it because she's Korean.  Yeah.  Then you had this white guy  do this whole like  Asian stereotypical bit  and Richard Bills  gave the guy a talking to  saying that type of humor  doesn't fly in 2008.  Right. 
[00:28:00]  I couldn't believe  Bills would go down  that road.  Do we have tape of that?  Was he saying that?  I've been trying to find  this clip to play  on the show.  It's got to be  The Last Comic Standing.  It's got to be gettable.  I mean,  was he saying  it was a 40 bit  or was he saying  it was like inappropriate?  It was inappropriate.  Stereotypical humor  from a white guy  doesn't fly in the year 2008  and I'm like,  wow, that's weird  and then two comedians later  it's the Korean girl  doing pretty much  the same type of stuff.  Yeah, she's funny  but my problem with her  is that if you do  stereotypical stuff  about your own race  you have to be positive.  You have to,  you know what I mean? 
[00:28:30]  You have to make  Asians look good.  She doesn't.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, and she rips on  all the negative stuff  and her bit about  like how Asian guys  like you were saying  you know,  Asian guys  we're going to be  Asian guys are going to be  extinct because no one  wants to have sex with them.  I mean,  you can't see shit like that.  Fucking hilarious.  No, no, no.  He's a white guy.  He's pretty funny.  It's based in fact  for you Asian girl.  Applause break.  It's based in fact  and funniness.  Bobby's right.  Sit down.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Bobby.  Bobby, come back. 
[00:29:00]  Bobby Lee got his biggest laugh  by quoting another  female Asian comedian.  Bobby was looking  for our support on that one.  That's a hilarious joke.  Chicks always want  to fuck Asian guys, man.  You see,  there's a lot of Asian porn.  That's for sure.  Not one Asian porn guy  with white chicks.  But he's got that  great solution  with the hookers.  I mean,  it's covered, right?  It's the launching pad.  It works.  The launching pad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know why.  It's always got to... 
[00:29:30]  Is this the cool hot?  Is she a hot chick?  She's hot, yeah.  She's smuggish.  She wears tiny little skirts  and...  Ooh, I like that.  She plays up her hotness, yeah.  She has a nice little  asshole, I bet.  I bet it's...  Do we have any of her material?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Asian people are not hairy.  Yeah, but they have that...  Their skin is different  than their asshole.  It's like grayer.  Yeah.  It's like really white skin  and then right now  they're asshole  and their size gray.  And the genitals are...  Like, my genitals  are like now getting black.  Wait, wait.  Ew, are they?  Yeah, yeah.  There she is. 
[00:30:00]  Hi!  Hi, so my parents  are from Korea  and I went to Korea once.  It was really weird.  Everybody was Korean.  And my relatives  came to pick me up.  I got in the wrong car  like ten times.  You guys think  you can't tell us apart?  We can't tell either,  you know?  I doubt that.  She looks fuckable.  Oh, she's...  So, but I'm glad I'm here. 
[00:30:30]  Asian girls are dangerous  in the States,  you know?  Yeah?  I mean, seriously,  does anybody in here  not have an Asian fetish?  See what I mean?  What?  There's one guy up there?  What is he, gay?  I want to date Esther Cook.  I want her to be my girlfriend.  I don't know if you guys  at home can see this,  but there's this guy up here.  He looks like  he's surprised to see  an Asian in pigtails  without punching  in his credit card number. 
[00:31:00]  That's fucking funny.  That's a funny joke.  Oh, let's get you all wrong.  Seriously,  Asian girls  are going out with, like,  white guys,  black guys,  you know?  Everybody but Asian guys.  Uh-oh.  That's fucking true.  Why's she got a hate?  You know, like,  what's going to happen  to Asian guys?  They're going to go extinct  or something?  As they sit at home  playing video games?  I'm going to kill her.  Like, I feel bad.  He didn't even quote 
[00:31:30]  her best joke  and it killed.  But, like,  not bad enough  to date them.  You know what?  If your dick was big enough,  I'd choke her with it.  Like, last week,  this Asian guy  asked me out  and I was just like,  geez,  when are they going  to realize  that Asian girls  are just way  out of their league?  That's daddy anger.  And my girlfriends  are always asking me,  they're like,  how do you stay so skinny?  And I always tell them,  just do what we do,  you know?  Eat with chopsticks.  I feel stock.  We can't pick much up  with those things either.  It's all stocky.  Yeah.  And then shove it 
[00:32:00]  down your throat  and throw up.  I love her.  She's very fuckable, though.  She's great.  She's doing a fucking,  no one can tell  a park joke,  a Bolivia joke,  a fucking,  a trip off  a lion joke.  I mean,  it's an ancient  Korean secret  that dog is like  25% more lean  than turkey.  You still love her?  Duh.  More.  Actually,  I don't even know  how to use chopsticks.  Like,  I'm completely American.  I was born here.  I mean,  I'm so American, 
[00:32:30]  I'm against immigration.  Because I'm here already.  And I ordered Chinese yesterday  and a Mexican guy  delivered it.  She's like an Asian  Sarah Silverman.  With her attitude.  Sarah Silverman.  I was like,  what is going on here?  This is so sexy.  They're taking all  of our jobs.  I was like, 
[00:33:00]  what's next?  Dry cleaning?  Nail salons?  Two rules.  Massage?  And I opened up  the fortune cookie.  It said,  Confucius say,  no hablo ingles.  I want to put her  in a wedding dress  and just shit in her mouth.  I was like,  this is crazy.  I have to get him back.  So tomorrow,  I want to apply for a drive  at Taco Bell.  Like,  you want sweet and sour sauce  with your chalupa? 
[00:33:30]  So it's cool being here.  Whenever I miss  my grandparents though,  I could always turn on  the TV and watch  reruns of MASH.  That's pretty funny.  Me so funny.  All right,  thank you guys.  I'm Esther Kuhn.  I like it, man.  She's delicious.  Yeah, but every joke  has something to do  with her being Korean  and that can't be  a part of your trip.  It's the whole thing.  It's the entire act.  I mean,  I do half of it,  but it's just like,  you know. 
[00:34:00]  I love that Bobby comes in  and he's like,  I got a real issue  with this Esther Kuhn replay  and everyone's like,  yeah!  This rules!  When's the album coming out?  She's cute.  She's everything.  I know.  You're just,  I'm wrong.  Baby, I'm wrong.  She reminds me of a black,  you know that black girl,  Esther Kuhn?  Jesus.  Well, we can goof on Asians  in my house.  Of course we can.  You like Asian chicks?  No, I don't have a fetish  for any girl,  but she was great.  I enjoyed her very much.  No, I've slept with 
[00:34:30]  like two Asian girls  in my life.  Typically, no.  We've got to find the bells.  That's one more than me, man.  I like that French comedian  Esther Kuhn.  D'Etat.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I will be appearing.  She's crazy, though.  There's no dates to speak of.  She's always chilly.  It's Esther Kuhn.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yes, she wasn't bad.  But Bilzer said it's okay  if you're a part of that group  to make fun of. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, of course.  That's the way humor  should be broken down.  That's fucking bullshit.  Of course, that's a terrible idea.  I like Bilzer,  but it's like,  oh, Richard.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Joey in Louisiana.  Joey!  What's going on, bro?  How do you do, Joe?  Hey, Joey!  Hey, man.  Big fan.  O&A.  Bob Kelly, love you.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I don't know who this Mike guy is,  but Bobby...  Thanks, man.  All right, peace.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  25 a day? 
[00:35:30]  Bike it in.  Yeah, I don't do it now.  I mean, how the hell  did you keep up  with 25 a day, my man?  Well, you know,  I was on a show, right?  So I had a little bit  of money at that time,  and I just spent it all on drugs.  I had like three or four people  I went to in L.A.,  and all the sketch guys.  Well, I can't remember.  I was revealed to me.  I was like, wow, it's...  And, yeah, but I quit, dude.  I was going to die.  You fuck... 
[00:36:00]  A lot of girls, like,  watch your show.  You get star pussy.  That's good.  No, I haven't been late  in five months, actually.  Come on.  Five months.  My choice, probably, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Because I was in a relationship,  and so I did so much  that whole thing.  Are you taking, like,  a little time for you?  Well, no.  You know, I'd rather jerk off, honestly.  It's nice, right?  Patrice was saying that yesterday.  Patrice O'Neill said  the exact same thing.  He said he's reaching the point  where the pussy isn't like it was  when he was in his 20s,  where it was the be-all,  do-all, end-all of everything.  The chase isn't worth  the actual coming of it,  you know what I mean?  It's like something  you chase for 10 hours and stuff, 
[00:36:30]  and it's just like...  And after you nut,  you're like, that's it?  You know what I mean?  So I'd rather just do it right then,  get the juice out,  and then move on with my life.  I like to call it the poison.  Oh, the poison, yeah.  Get the poison.  Spice it up.  You should just come inside them  and see what happens.  Yeah.  It mixes things up.  Strangle them a little bit  when I'm inside them.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you just gotta get kickier.  But you know what?  You gotta manipulate,  and sometimes you gotta buy dinner  and all that stuff,  and it's just like...  It's a whole thing.  You have to buy dinner still?  You're fucking famous,  and you got money,  and you still have to buy him dinner? 
[00:37:00]  You can't just say,  come to my pad?  When you're on SNL,  you don't have to buy him dinner,  but on Mad TV,  you have to go on dinner.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Let's say hi.  You're not...  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi to David in Michigan.  David.  ONA, before I found you guys  and was turned to the wonderful  dark side of your humor,  I listened to fucking Bob and Tom.  I heard Mike Birbiglia on there,  and I thought,  yeah, he's okay.  He's kind of funny.  But I'll tell you what,  the dark side Mike Birbiglia  fucking rocks.  I love it. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, this is a different side  of you today, Mike.  It's early.  It's early?  Before I'm really awake.  Yeah.  You get his chops.  I love it.  All right, cool.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  He is Sam.  Sam, coming up after the break,  part two of Bobby Lee.  Yes, E-Rock,  Bobby Lee is an insane,  crazy person maniac,  and we decided to horribly exploit it.  We fucked with him.  We did.  And we enjoy it.  He's on TV, so it's okay.  It's coming up next  on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:38:00]  Celebrities aren't real people.  No, they're not.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  with Sam and E-Rock.  We're continuing on with Bobby Lee.  Sam, what happens now?  Well, we've established  what an insane maniac Bobby Lee is,  so we at the Opie and Anthony show  do the sensitive thing  and just start destroying  and breaking down his psyche.  Yeah, Bobby has a lot of phobias.  Yes, Bobby Lee.  Bobby Lee.  And for some reason,  we had a rabbit costume  in the back office,  so we decided to pretend 
[00:38:30]  that maybe there was a character  that only Bobby Lee could see,  but the rest of the crew  didn't see it all.  One minute,  Bobby Lee's seeing a rabbit.  He's turning around  and all the audience,  the studio audience  that we had at the time  had disappeared.  The table was moving up and down.  He came close a few times  to running out.  As a matter of fact,  wasn't Mike Birbiglia  in studio this day?  Oh, yeah, he might have been.  I believe he was.  Sleepwalk with me,  Bobby Lee,  on the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Way to tie it in.  That's what I do. 
[00:39:00]  You're listening to the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Sorry about that.  That fast already?  Oh, shit.  Bobby, you enjoy your first visit  to the Opie and Anthony show?  That was fun.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Did you guys make up?  Yeah.  No, we're cool, man.  He's, yeah.  It was weird.  It's like we're friends.  I don't know, man.  That's what I said.  That was my point.  Yeah.  From the get-go.  We hung out.  You were drunk.  I haven't seen you guys  in a while.  Thanks for having me on.  Were you feeling 
[00:39:30]  he's really hurt  that he didn't hug you?  Like a little bit?  Like you just slighted?  Yeah, a little bit.  Dude, give him a really good hug.  Like, wow,  I was really good.  Dude, you should see everything.  You want to see the underwear  I'm wearing right now?  Yeah.  Get naked.  Bobby, I did Bobby.  Give, give.  Oh, my God.  I was packing.  I had nothing clean.  So I just put these on.  So you borrowed your girlfriends?  Those are, yeah.  You want to hug now?  Those aren't yours.  Chick-like.  You want to hug now?  Bobby.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is he wearing...  Bobby.  That's chick underwear.  Those aren't yours.  They are mine. 
[00:40:00]  No, they're not.  Yes, they are, Robert.  You've got a pink trim toe.  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, wait.  We can't just casually...  Dude, I didn't put them on  like I'm going to wear  this on opening Anthony.  No, I just...  No, I know you don't, Bobby.  Every time I've seen you,  you always take your clothes off,  which is what I love about you.  I don't care.  But are those really  men's underwear?  Yes, they're men's underwear.  Okay.  Just to explain to people listening,  your underwear is like  black and white  striped women's underwear  with a pink trim.  Yeah.  And there's a little...  And they're a little too tiny  on the sides. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they're very bikini-ish.  I should have shown them.  They look good.  My bad.  I apologize.  I think they look good.  You still haven't hugged Mike, though.  All right, I'll do it now.  I thought you were going to  hug him in the underwear,  but I guess we don't get that.  I don't...  See, everything's okay.  I don't care what kind of underwear people are.  Mike slapped him on the back  like, oh, I'm not a faggot.  That was not as good as...  Hold on, hold on.  Anthony says he doesn't care  what kind of underwear people wear.  Underwear people?  It doesn't bother me.  Do you wear panties?  I'd wear fucking, like, sad panties. 
[00:41:00]  What are you doing right now?  It's in my bag.  He wears boxers.  You wear boxers.  I think everybody else wears boxers.  I prefer briefs.  Tiny whiteys.  Boxers don't help F you piss  to keep the piss from going down  your fucking to your kneecap.  Shaking does.  What about boxer briefs?  No, no.  I messed up.  It's a good talking point.  You guys are going to talk about it later.  I just forget what you're wearing.  What?  What happened?  No, like, tomorrow,  you guys are going to talk about my underwear.  Like, how he's gay and all that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  No, not. 
[00:41:30]  No, we won tomorrow.  That was a really...  Why would we do that?  I thought I was comfortable  that we were all friends.  I just showed him, man.  I like him.  No, man.  There's a vibe here now.  There's a vibe.  Let me see him again.  What, really?  Yes.  All right.  He's underwear.  Dude, what do you want?  Pull your pants up in the back.  Pull him up in the back.  His underwear are like half down his ass.  Pull him up in the back.  Bobby's on.  Let me get a picture.  Say, that's, uh...  Let me get a picture.  That's kind of...  Move the coffee cup, too.  Jim.  Bobby, move the coffee cup. 
[00:42:00]  Not funny a little...  It's funny a little bit.  What?  Yeah, I like it.  Move the coffee cup.  It's funny a little bit.  I'm getting your picture.  Hold on a minute.  Bobby, look over here.  Yeah, I'm seeing like a...  It's a zebra stripe kind of a thing.  Yeah, Marky, Marky.  This is my clothes, dude.  I need these.  But then the pink trim is a little odd, but...  It's just the pink trim, but you know what?  They're punk rock, dude.  They're the punk.  Yeah, they're punk.  I like them.  All right, thanks, man.  I really appreciate the hug, though, Bobby.  I got on my Hot Topic.  He got my Ricky's.  That's fucking racist.  That's fucking racist.  What?  Forever 21.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, big rig causes... 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God, look at that.  Hey, Bob.  My underwear cost is different.  Bobby, you're going to have to come back tomorrow.  You come back tomorrow if you're around and you're not doing anything.  Yeah, fuck it, man.  I just want to give you the invite.  That didn't mean get the fuck out now.  Why?  Yeah, sit down.  The show's not done yet.  I don't know how it works.  We stay until...  When they get up and leave, that's when we leave.  Bob Kelly.  He read that perfectly, by the way.  So now it's really awkward.  What is that?  Bobby Lee.  That was his out.  What? 
[00:43:00]  It's weird now.  What's going on?  I should leave?  Why is it silent?  Because I bombed horribly?  Oh.  Oh, no, I don't even think you're kidding.  It's all about timing.  Maybe I shouldn't have waited two minutes before I bring back something.  And, Mike, you got your stuff on iTunes.  Yeah.  I'm competing with Rob Kelly.  I got two albums.  And you got an off-Broadway thing that's happening.  I got two, and I got a DVD.  What about the off-Broadway thing? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah, Sleepwalk With Me.  Me and Mike are going to be number one and two today.  Yeah, we're going to go up the charts above Bo Burnham.  Yeah, Bo and Dane Cook.  Dane Cook has all four.  Four in the top seven or something.  Yeah, something like that.  Boy, that guy really makes a pretty penny.  Hey, Roland bought one of those shirts, by the way.  We didn't talk about it on the air.  Yeah?  The Dane Cook shirt.  Yeah, he was on Jimmy Kimmel, and he was like, I can say anything today, and then tomorrow it's on YouTube, and then everybody has it. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, I could say A, semi-colon, what is it?  A-6.  And tomorrow there'll be a shirt.  There'll be shirts out there.  And the next day, it was all over the internet, and then he had shirts.  And now Roland has one.  That's not a semi-colon, though.  That is a full colon.  But Roland got one of the shirts.  This is a Dane Cook shirt.  This is the shirt that he just made up on the spot on Jimmy Kimmel, and people are buying them.  He just made up that thing, and then now he probably made, what, $20,000?  How much did that shirt cost?  $20,000? 
[00:44:30]  $45,000.  $45,000.  Did you know what you were buying?  $45,000.  Made $45,000.  $45,000.  Oh, my God.  Roland, did you know what you were buying?  No, it was soft, so I bought it.  It was soft, so you bought it.  What concert?  I want you to try.  At the Garden.  Oh, fuck.  At what concert?  I had a good one.  Did I get you?  Yeah.  Whose concert?  Dane Cook, when he did the Garden.  You didn't know what that meant?  No, I know what that meant.  You did?  No, because I saw him on Kimmel, that's why.  You best not fuck.  Bobby, where are you going? 
[00:45:00]  He's turning.  You all right?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I started having a panic attack, man.  Why?  No, I started breathing.  I started sweating.  I got to get out.  Yeah?  Why?  I had a breathing thing.  So we'll fucking deal with it.  Xanax is on long.  No, I started getting like I was...  He's sweating.  He turned red.  They're not coming in.  They're fine.  He was freaking out because we weren't talking about him.  No, that's not what it was, man.  We didn't get the whole big game, cooking, and then all of a sudden I didn't know what  was going on.  You want a Vicodin?  Oh, jeez.  Dude, he swears really bad, and he turned. 
[00:45:30]  Your color came back.  Well, you were a different color.  You were red.  I was pink, and now I'm yellow again?  Yeah, you're back to yellow.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry about that.  Oh, ask for who can do it.  I can?  You can do whatever you want.  Mike thinks you were looking for a test.  You got to deal with those panic attacks there, Bobby?  No, no.  I was actually going to leave.  I understand where you're coming from.  I have that, too, man.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I'm Bobby.  Where are you going?  Bobby.  My thing cut off.  Bobby.  Bobby, sit down.  You get panic attacks?  Yeah.  I don't know where he just got up and started panicking, sweating. 
[00:46:00]  His face turned beet red, and he was just walking out of here.  It's called a panic attack.  Yeah.  You all right?  I'll find out.  You all right?  Someone just handed him the ratings for Mad TV.  Oh, jeez.  Wow, you are fucking brutal, man.  Look, man, I don't even have a show.  I'm just making funny.  I don't have your career.  Come on.  I don't have a...  Is this on?  Can you hear me?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Why, your headphones aren't working?  Nothing's working.  That's what happened.  No, the headphones aren't working.  Hey, anyone else...  Probably need another battery in there, son of a bitch.  Anyone else feel that?  What?  How was that?  Oh, my God.  You feel the room shake?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that?  Earthquake.  What was that?  I have no idea.  I'm sure Steve dropped the ball again.  Bobby, you feel that?  Wow.  No.  Were you sweating?  You didn't feel the room shake?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting dizzy.  Yeah, it feels like a little mini earthquake.  Yeah, that was weird, dude.  What the hell was that?  You can't have...  I don't know.  You all right? 
[00:47:00]  That's weird.  In New York City, Jesus.  You felt that?  Yeah, dude.  That's weird.  Nothing.  Why don't we just try to end this as quick as we can get to fun?  Yeah, come on.  Let's just do it.  You all right, Bobby?  Yeah, you said the shaking.  It stopped.  It was shaking, though.  Mars, why?  This is a floating room, right?  Yeah, the room floats, so...  It's suspended?  Yeah.  We're going to be safe?  Yeah.  Okay.  You sure?  We'll see.  Oh.  What do you mean, we'll see?  You went from yep to we'll see to what?  No? 
[00:47:30]  To nowhere goners.  Bobby, you know what's really weird about this studio?  What?  There's a fucking 40-story crane right outside this building, and man, if one of those brackets  goes...  Did you hear that?  This goes right through the fucking studio.  That happened in Israel the other day.  Look, it was by Terrace.  Look out Anthony's window.  I'm not kidding.  Terrace did it.  You've got to see this, Bobby.  It freaks us out every day.  Look at this thing.  That's not good.  Yeah, those things...  I've got to go.  Those things fall down all the time.  No, honestly, I'm like, I'm like, there's some weirds going on here.  We're almost done.  This is not working.  No, it's not. 
[00:48:00]  It's just your headphones.  Your headphones aren't working.  Yeah, he's right.  The mic's not working.  Mars, can you fix his mic?  It's not working.  I can't hear nothing.  Yeah.  Are we still on?  Are we on the air?  What's going on?  We haven't been on the air in 15 minutes.  Oh, we haven't?  No.  Oh.  You can leave.  It's good meeting you.  Bobby.  Oh, are you mad now?  Fucking Bobby.  We love you, man.  Take a deep breath.  That's water. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, get some water in you.  You know, the studio shook a little bit, and we got a crane that might topple over.  We're cool.  Hasn't toppled over yet, so I don't think today's the day.  No, but that happens, like, a lot.  That happens sometimes for me.  It's hot in here.  Well, I just start sweating and stuff, and it's weird.  Anyone else see the cockroaches?  Yeah.  They're fucking, they'll get rid of them.  Boy, I hate cockroaches, dude.  Where the fuck are cockroaches?  Cockroach.  The studio has been infested with them because of construction.  Yeah, the construction and the fucking disgusting, deplorable conditions over by that refrigerator. 
[00:49:00]  The food was, like, snotty smashed against the fucking door.  They live in chairs.  It's a mess, wasn't it?  Bobby.  These chairs.  They live in chairs.  What the fuck are you talking about?  The stuffing of the chairs is where they live in chairs.  That's where they lay their eggs, in chairs.  You're out of your fucking mind.  Google it.  Google it.  Swear to God.  They live in walls.  Swear to God.  They live in couches.  They live everywhere.  First of all, they live fucking everywhere.  They live, like, under cabinets, in cabinets, in the walls. 
[00:49:30]  They don't live in chairs.  But they can't live in chairs is what he's saying.  Not in both chairs.  Nothing can live in his chair.  They lay eggs in mattresses and things.  It is true.  Furniture.  I liked it a lot.  Well, yeah, because they're everywhere.  They're fucking cockroaches.  But they don't fucking scurry to the chair when you turn the light on.  Maybe I was being serious.  Maybe I was just playing along with the game and trying to, you know.  No, there's really a lot of fuck with me.  I don't know, Anthony.  Someone bring in a cockroach.  Maybe you can just stick to the plan.  See, that's what's making me sweat this whole banter, this whole thing.  The fuck? 
[00:50:00]  What is that?  What was that?  What are you talking about?  Did you see that?  What happened?  I want to eat.  What?  What?  What the fuck is going on?  Is that building just shake?  What?  I felt something.  I got to piss.  Bobby, honestly, though, there are cockroaches in here.  I got to piss.  First of all, honestly, that drop ceiling, we know there's cockroaches up in there, so  just be careful above your head.  But something is moving or something.  It's weird.  Keep the fucking shit over there as far as the cockroaches are concerned.  Because we haven't seen any in the studio yet. 
[00:50:30]  And if I see one in this fucking studio, because I do not want to have shit come home with me.  Plus you get stuffy.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Because that's what will happen.  You bring a bag in here from home.  I got to get out of here, man.  Where are you going?  What's wrong?  Something weird is happening.  I think I'm tired or something.  What are you talking about?  Tired?  No, I didn't sleep well last night.  I had like two hours of sleep.  And I'm literally like, my whole thing is like...  What, your EQ?  Did this thing move?  What are you talking about?  Are you all right, dude?  Are you flipping out? 
[00:51:00]  No, I'm flipping out.  Are you flipping out?  I got to get out of here.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, I'm losing my mind, man.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  20,000 pound.  There is something going on here.  Sit down.  First of all, I just want to say, we're probably off the air.  That's fine.  No, we're not.  We're off the air?  Yeah, we told you that.  First of all, let me just say this.  The mic is not working.  I can't hear myself.  We can hear you.  And then, my whole level of...  I feel like something's shaking or something's going on.  No, something did shake in the studio.  But that was a while ago. 
[00:51:30]  I have to piss.  Is everything cool?  Yeah.  Look.  Does he have headphones?  I feel like I'm...  I just saw it.  Why are you freaking me out?  Bobby.  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby Lee's leaving the studio.  Bobby, relax.  Is the table moving?  No.  How about is he doing this?  Is the table moving?  This is a half ton.  How can we move this fucking thing?  Hey, dude.  Just sit down.  Relax.  You're freaking me out.  You're freaking me out.  Just be fine, dude.  Go out, dude.  Chill out just a little bit.  It's all good.  Look, I'm checking email. 
[00:52:00]  How could all hell be breaking lists if I'm checking email?  Are you on Sally D?  Yeah, maybe you...  Sally D.  Hey, you guys want to do...  Jimmy went to the bathroom.  Bobby Lee thinks things are moving around in the studio.  Is it floors or something?  No.  Everything's good, Bobby.  All right?  Bobby's probably...  Because I've been tired, too, and my equilibrium gets a little fucking thrown.  Yeah, dude.  Well, you have ice cream, too.  Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah.  You have a problem.  Okay.  But his headphones aren't working.  We can hear you on mic.  Don't worry about that. 
[00:52:30]  All right, it's fine.  Okay.  And watch out.  Honestly, that drop ceiling does have cockroaches.  We haven't seen any today yet.  The ceiling drops?  Well, it is a drop ceiling already.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  So...  Anyone else see the beekeeper?  All right, that's it.  This is moving now.  I just saw it.  I...  Listen.  Oh, my God.  He's losing his mind.  That's messed up because, listen...  How could this thing move?  Look how big this thing is, Bobby.  It's either that or I'm going crazy, dude, and I need to go and take a nap. 
[00:53:00]  What are you seeing, really?  Seriously.  I'm seeing either the floor is moving up...  Right.  ...or this is moving, or I'm literally like...  Bobby, you see how big this table is and all this equipment...  How is all this going to move?  Seriously.  Why is everybody leaving the building?  Huh?  Why is all these...  The office is empty now.  All right, dude.  I've got to get out of here, dude.  Are they all in front of the...  There's something going on.  Honestly, thank you so much for having me on.  Where are you going?  Bobby.  I've got to get out of here, man.  For what?  No, there's something going on here, like... 
[00:53:30]  Oh, where are they?  No, no, no, no.  Dude, why is everyone leaving?  See, that's the thing.  Oh, crap.  People are leaving.  I've got to leave.  When people leave, I leave.  You know what I mean?  Why?  Why?  I don't let them leave.  Dude, they're just leaving.  Hey, did you sleep at all that shit?  What's wrong with this guy?  I'm just staring at him trying to figure him out.  Oh, shit.  All right, can we do line of the day?  Yeah, let's do line of the day.  Let's do line of the day here.  Why did the audience leave? 
[00:54:00]  What?  I'm eating it.  Am I acting crazy?  What?  Am I acting crazy right now?  No, I mean, you just...  I don't know.  Are you all right?  Are you fine?  You're fine.  Nah, everybody's fine.  Look at...  Oh, fuck.  What happened to the TVs?  Oh, shit.  No video signal.  What the fuck's that about?  Oh, that's fucking great.  Oh, jeez, now I want to...  I think I'm going to go.  This is like a fucking submarine.  Mike, where are you going, Mike?  It's like a submarine.  I ain't fucking...  It's a...  Everybody left. 
[00:54:30]  I did not say...  Wait a minute.  No, no, no, no.  Mike, I've got to go.  Guys, wait, no.  I've seen this on the news and stuff.  Promote your show, dude.  No, I already did it.  It's like a fucking...  Bobby, Bobby.  You guys...  You guys...  No, you guys are going to talk like...  Oh, you're great.  It's like a submarine with a hull breach.  You know...  Well, it is...  There's something weird definitely going on.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Mike...  Mike Birbiglia is preventing him from leaving.  Yeah, Mike's preventing him.  I like that, actually.  We're going to just stay a couple more minutes, and then we'll go.  Bobby, come back.  We love you. 
[00:55:00]  We want you to come back on the show.  Or why are people leaving?  And then I feel like...  How are we playing a trick on you?  We're doing a radio show.  They left.  I don't know why.  The lights went out.  I don't know why.  We lost the TV signal.  I don't know why.  And I did feel something, but that was a while ago, and you're still seeing things.  But you did have a little panic attack before, so it's probably like the residuals.  Oh, God.  All right.  Let's...  Are we almost ready for the line of the day?  Mm-hmm.  I hate being cut off like this. 
[00:55:30]  Bob?  Yeah.  He's closing his eyes.  Yeah, relax a little bit, bro.  Yeah, chill out.  Breathe.  Bam.  What's that?  All right.  What do we do?  Bobby, why are you covering your eyes?  I'm fine.  I'm going to smash you.  Are you okay?  What the fuck is that?  My God.  What's what?  There's a bunny rabbit.  What?  Where?  Where's there a bunny rabbit? 
[00:56:00]  I know.  This is like...  You got to put any tricks on me, man.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  How could we be playing tricks on you, Bobby?  Not that type of broadcast.  What are you talking about?  You smell that?  No, there's a bunny rabbit.  Do you smell?  Where?  There's a bunny rabbit right there.  Where?  Robert, there's a bunny rabbit.  I can't see a fucking bunny rabbit, Bobby.  Are you fucking with me now?  You're fucking with me.  You're fucking with me.  Dude, I know what's going on.  Yeah.  I know what's going on now.  And that's good that you did that. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Show us the bunny rabbit.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  Show us the bunny rabbit.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  I'm with you.  Yeah, show us.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  Show us.  Out there somewhere?  All right, I'm leaving.  Where are you going?  I've got to get out of here.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Thanks for having me on the show.  Baby, wait.  All right.  All right.  Bobby.  All right, there goes Bobby Lee.  And he's looking for the bunny rabbit.  Bobby.  Bobby, where are you going?  He ran out.  He ran out.  No, no, I'm going because there's something going on.  He ran out of the studio to go find the bunny.  No, no, no.  I've got to go.  What's wrong?  And the bunny.  No, no. 
[00:57:00]  I love those guys.  I'm sweating.  I've got to get out of here.  I've got to go to sleep.  What are you doing?  They want to talk to you.  No, no, no.  I'm done.  They didn't say you can leave.  No, no.  They didn't say you can leave.  Rules are rules, man.  It's like there's no rules.  I've got to eat.  No, no, no.  I did.  I did it like two hours.  It was fun.  The funniest thing.  Tell him we're going to breakfast.  The funniest thing.  He wasn't.  No, I'm having a panic attack.  I've got to get out of here.  Is he coming back?  What are you doing?  No, no, no.  I wasn't going to go.  I'm in the elevator.  All right.  Let him go on the elevator. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, what's up?  Tell him we're going to breakfast.  No, I can't come.  I can't come back, guys.  Why?  Because there's some sort of deception and some shadow play going on, and I'm not in on it.  And you know what?  I'm going to get you guys back.  What type of...  There's deception.  What type of shadow play is going on here that's fine?  Ah, the elevator door's shut.  Oh, well.  He's done?  Dude, he wasn't sure if the bunny rabbit was real, so he ran out of the studio, because 
[00:58:00]  that was the only way he could figure it out, was to find the bunny rabbit, and whoever  was in the bunny rabbit suit, to tear down a wall right now, was able to hide, and he  never found the bunny rabbit, and that really just freaked him the fuck out.  You don't need to tear down the wall.  I don't think anybody thought there was a giant bunny rabbit.  Let me tear the wall down here.  But the thing I do want to add was, I was like, fuck, he's going to find the bunny, and he  never found the bunny.  So. 
[00:58:30]  Guys.  We don't treat our guests nicely.  Yeah.  We really don't.  And we were moving the console up and down.  It was the first time he was in here, and the console's moving up and down.  Fake earthquake.  Yeah, you've got to get him back in tomorrow.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, I think this might be a highlight for you.  We're going to talk about Anthony's dick.  Why would that be a highlight for me?  I don't know.  You seemed all excited reading the paper.  When we get back from break, I'm going to slap E-Rock in his jaws for making a disrespectful 
[00:59:00]  comment on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Huge.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  He is Sam.  I am E-Rock.  You know, once in a while, Anthony...  I hear he's got a big dick.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  Oh.  Well, once in a while, Anthony will start to think of a story that relates to his childhood,  and then usually his childhood relates to either two things, him being a crybaby or 
[00:59:30]  him having a lot of sex at an early age.  Yes, and in this particular story, it was the sex which led to the theorizing and hypothesizing  as to the size of Anthony's genitalia, which Norton did not let go of for at least half  an hour.  No, they just kept going about how big Norton thought it was.  Now, E-Rock, you've seen it.  How big is Anthony's genitalia?  I've never even seen his house.  Oh, it's nice. 
[01:00:00]  I haven't been invited.  It's great.  Here it is.  Anthony's dick on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  What the fuck is this?  You're listening to the worst.  What the fuck is this?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I want to continue with something we started today.  Now, you're very knowledgeable.  You know a lot of this stuff.  Oh, I try.  And I want to know what horrific memory from your childhood has been pushed out of your  brain so that is in its place.  It could have been the big, fat American Indian woman trying to rape me in a barn when I was 
[01:00:30]  about 13 years old at Jimmy Jackson's ranch.  What?  All right, listen.  We started a new thing today for the listeners, the hardcore listeners.  You know, we all know that Anthony's very knowledgeable, but it's finally became quite  apparent that he's filling his brain with all this useless nonsense to forget about horrific  things that happened to you as a child.  Now, you've never told this story on the air before. 
[01:01:00]  No, I think I did tell it.  It was at Jimmy Jackson's, who was a crazy cowboy out there when I was living in California.  He used to sell dead horses.  Yeah, he tried to sell people dead horses and stuff.  He ran a rent string and I used to run it for him, a very equestrian part of California.  I lived in San Juan Capistrano, a lot of horses.  It's where the swallows come back, blah, blah, blah.  But there was a party going on there.  Everybody's drunk, of course.  And I went around the back to the barn to take a leak. 
[01:01:30]  And there was this big, fat American Indian woman.  And she was kind of in the barn.  And she got a peek at your monster 12-year-old cock.  And she wanted...  She thought it was a kayak.  Shut up.  She wanted to, as she said, roll around in the hay with me.  And I zipped up pretty quickly and started getting out of there.  And she was all drunk and she started rolling and kind of crawling toward me. 
[01:02:00]  And I think if she got like a hold of my leg, it would have been over.  And the things that scared me the most...  Can you keep me on your face?  Like, I was hammered at the time, too.  Who knows?  I probably would have fucked her, but...  Rapes and hay.  Yeah.  Is that her American Indian name?  Rapes and hay.  Hey, squall.  But the thing that scared me is her husband was there at the party.  And he looked like fucking Billy Bear from 48 Hours.  Just a big engine with a knife. 
[01:02:30]  And that kind of scared me that, you know, he was going to chop me to pieces and stuff.  So I got out of there.  But that was one of those horrific memories that probably shouldn't happen to a young boy.  How old were you?  14?  I think 13.  She was a big, fat Indian with little hands.  Like those little Indian hands.  Yeah, little Indian hands.  She had like the, I don't know...  Did you see her naked?  ...whole Aztec face.  I don't know what the hell was gone.  The zitty Indian face?  I don't know what it was.  It was like kind of an Aztec flat thing. 
[01:03:00]  No, she wasn't naked.  But she, um, she was like kind of toying with herself.  Yuck.  Yeah.  I think she was waiting for anyone to come back there to take a piss.  Like anybody.  She had nice little hands for making trinkets.  Trinkets.  Great little hands for making beaded $1.50 trinkets.  Buffing turquoise.  Yes.  Trying to trade a blowjob for some beads.  Yeah.  More importantly, when did you realize you had a monster cock? 
[01:03:30]  At what age?  Hey!  I just think I'm average.  When did you realize it was monstrous?  12, 13?  Um, I, you know, you just don't know.  You don't think I've...  How many oh my gods have you got?  ...compared to...  Right.  My God.  Let's talk about your cock for a few minutes.  You got a big cock.  This is quite embarrassing.  Yeah, I think he does.  He does.  I don't talk about my...  The famous wow story from our Boston days proves that Anthony is packing something monstrous.  That was something that just, uh, it must have been perfect timing. 
[01:04:00]  That's right.  I bet Anthony has a...  They saw it.  Anthony has a huge, just helmet.  That's just defined.  Why is the discussion turned to my dick?  To your monstrous dick?  It's just really defined from his shaft, and then it just goes, spreads out like a big  wild mushroom.  Shut the fuck up.  You think he has a big, thick crown on his?  Oh, a big, huge crown.  He has a portobello dick.  Huge portobello.  He's got a play...  He's got a playboy cartoon cock.  Just a huge...  Just a well-defined... 
[01:04:30]  Stop it.  His pee hole is huge.  Right.  Look, I won't be party to this.  You could stick like a half a dollar in his pee hole.  I don't like the idea of Bob Kelly fantasizing about my dick.  No, you're monstrous.  Stop.  We're inserting change into it.  Yes, I know.  What the fuck is it?  I bet it hooks to a...  To, like, the left or to the...  It has a hook to it.  Would you please?  It's not that we're gay.  We're just curious in, like, a Ripley's Believe It or Not way.  We're not gay, we're amazed.  Yeah, we... 
[01:05:00]  How many times has that been used?  I'm not gay.  I'm just amazed.  Just amazed.  We want to see the midget, the bearded lady, and your monstrous dick.  All for a dollar.  With your big vein down the top of it.  Just a huge...  Well-defined veins.  Yeah.  More than one.  Oh, just a huge...  Oh, you motherfuckers.  You guys should see his pulse going in his cock.  It's not a pulsating vein.  What do you think his bald egg looks like?  Oh, he's got a big, droopy old man's head.  I do not!  It actually makes his dick bigger because it stretches out the skin. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  A deflated weather balloon.  Everything's very nice and tight.  Where he's a deflated weather balloon.  Like an Area 51 balloon.  It's the thing that fucking crashed in Roswell, but it's fleshy.  It has big fucking oblong balls in it.  You think he's ashamed to wear shorts because of the monstrous nature of his cock?  I wear shorts!  He has to wear a jock strap because his fucking huge sack would just sink out of his shorts.  Why are these fantasies of Bob Kelly coming out that are completely inaccurate? 
[01:06:00]  It's about my genitalia.  But it's in a P.T. Barnum way.  Let's just keep it, you know...  See the man whose cock could gag a hippo.  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking will better swallow it all.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  You can stick five quarters in his pee hole.  Jimmy Jakes is writing, Ant's cock has an elbow in it. 
[01:06:30]  Is that true, Anthony?  No!  It's got a joint.  Yeah.  And for the people that are lingering longer, yes, of course.  Show us your quack!  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  He doesn't trim.  You don't trim anything down there.  He doesn't have a femur.  I'm not explaining my trimming habits to anybody.  You don't trim anything.  I don't think Anthony believes in that.  How do you know that?  That grooming thing. 
[01:07:00]  How do you know?  He trims a little bit sloppy.  I think he's got a landing strip.  I'm just a landing strip.  Which I recently did to myself.  And it's worked out well.  You want the landing strip?  Get your cell phone and rub it on your box right now.  Not my box.  Now I have a box.  I shave everything.  Anybody else?  No, I trim it way down.  You don't want to look like a fucking baby.  Jeff from...  I don't.  As a man, you can't do that.  Women doing that is fine.  But a guy shaving everything is a little weird there, Jimmy.  Jeff from Sacramento writes,  Was Anthony the model for the Superbad drawings? 
[01:07:30]  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Cloverfield 2.  The attack of the Kumia cops.  You should have said that to JJ.  You should have brought that up.  Yes, I could have starred in the...  No.  No?  It's...  You're being inaccurate.  When Anthony fucking walks naked around the house with a heart on, it's like, you know  that when a horse does it, it bounces up and down?  Yeah.  Because there's too much weight and it's too long.  Yeah.  It just has like a bounce.  Top heavy. 
[01:08:00]  It's a top heavy cock.  Top heavy cock.  Have you ever had a weighty penis that hits the water as you're sitting down to take a dump?  No.  Every once in a while, mine will get weighty and it'll hit water.  My balls are so big.  The toilet's clogged and you're flushed.  What do you mean it gets weighty?  I call it weighty.  It's just like it's heavy.  All of a sudden, it's just got a dip.  I piss on my balls.  Goes in for a dip.  I piss on my nuts.  I have really big balls and sometimes on my...  Or a really hobbly tiny cock.  I think it's a mixture of both.  You can't clear your bag. 
[01:08:30]  I can't.  This cock looks like a spy versus spy bomb.  That was great.  Is it small, Bob?  No.  I have a grow another shower.  Well, that's what everyone says that has a small one.  That's what you tell the girls.  Just wait.  Now, hold on a second.  Trust me on this.  It'll be here in a second.  Two fists and a thumb.  We can all do two fists if we push down hard enough. 
[01:09:00]  I actually have to use elastic to stretch my balls out.  If Bob does two fists, if you look at the back, his asshole is pink-socky because of  the pressure.  He's pushing it out.  He does two fists, but it's Rich Voss's hands.  You get a pink sock when you fuck your girl's ass?  You pull your dick out, and that pink skin grips your cock like, get back here, you.  There's a vein in it.  Enough about the pink sock.  You can hear our asses saying, get back here, you.  Get back here, you.  God.  Why you?  Why I ought to...  Here's your cock. 
[01:09:30]  What's your hurry?  Anthony's big helmet.  Oh, all right.  I thought we were done.  Do we have time to do our theme news thing today?  We got three stories about pets.  What do you like to hear about?  The drill and the dog.  The drill and the dog from Disney.  Right.  The drill and the dog.  Legless chihuahuas.  Douchebags.  Or cattail in the mailbox.  Let's talk about Anthony's cock.  That'd be giant snake in the mailbox. 
[01:10:00]  Fucking clipped snake.  Fat crowned snake in the mailbox.  You think he has...  Fucking thick crowned.  You think he has...  Thick lickable head.  What?  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I was just...  Why does it keep...  You think he has to take in extra calories every day just to keep his cock well fit?  Of course he does.  That's why if he was out in the freezing cold, the vital organs, his cock would stay toasty  warm and his head would freeze off.  I think that's why Anthony has never been fat because...  Because, you know, all those extra calories are being used by the monstrous cock. 
[01:10:30]  The monstrous...  Old shiitake cock.  Old messy dick.  Why?  Big fucking...  Big fat hunk of meat you call genitals.  Big lucky devil.  And I don't mean you, I mean your girl.  For getting a hold of that monster.  This should just...  Have run its course.  Your cock has a handle.  It doesn't have a handle.  Sure, it folds up, goes in its own alligator bag. 
[01:11:00]  A bag made of alligator skin, which holds that giant appendage.  I bet you in a weird way, too, he's ashamed of it.  Like, he gets embarrassed.  Because when he was a little boy, they would call him Big Wee Wee Anthony.  Big Wee Wee Anthony.  No!  Special swim...  Special swim trunks for Anthony as a child.  They kicked him out of Little League because his cock was too manly and mature.  Shut up, Legal League.  But it would stick out both sides of the cup.  How are you going to do?  His boyish dick was always getting hit with ground balls because his ball bag and helmet 
[01:11:30]  would stick out of the sides of the fucking...  He couldn't get a cup.  Right.  I had to go to the adult cup section.  Yeah, he had to play the outfield because he couldn't get down on those ground balls  because his cock would kind of trip him up.  He'd squat down and his fucking cock and balls would bulge out like he was having a miscarriage  in his fucking baseball uniform.  He looked like a tranny in the outfield becoming bent down.  Come on!  Poor Anthony.  How could we possibly keep this subject going any longer? 
[01:12:00]  You would think it would be a blessing, but I think in his case it wasn't a blessing.  It was a lot of shame.  It was a lot of shame.  A lot of shame involved.  Even when the first girls, when he showed it to them, they'd go, ooh, he'd go, yeah,  I know, I'm sorry.  No, no, it's a good thing.  I'm sorry.  Just a lot of hair.  Oh, yeah, it was awful.  Way before the days, you know, you learned you could trim that shit down a little bit.  He wanted the hair to grow longer so it would look smaller.  He would always wear like bulky, like fucking, like bulky winter pants in the summer so the 
[01:12:30]  pants came out farther and that fucking, and that hunk of meat dangling from the front  of his torso looked more normal.  His cock had to get its own flu shot.  Right in the crown.  Oh, shit.  He didn't even flinch.  He didn't flinch at all.  Motherfucker.  This never gets fully hard because it's too big.  There's not enough blood in his body to just fill the whole thing. 
[01:13:00]  Every time he gets a heart on, he goes, pal.  I do not.  His head gets smaller when his dick gets hard.  What am I, a balloon?  People.  Right, right.  Fucking, just a fat helmet.  Giant, fat crown.  Just a huge crown.  Well-pronounced crown.  It's well-pronounced.  And it is jeans through thick dungarees. 
[01:13:30]  Dungarees.  You can see the crown through fucking two pairs of wranglers.  Like Magnum P.I.  How much cum do you think comes out of this monstrous cum?  It's probably an embarrassing amount of semen.  He actually used to jerk off on a girl's face and then try to not finish cumming because  she'd go, oh my God.  I'm going to drown.  Yeah.  I've never seen this much cum.  Are you sick?  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  I'm just thinking.  I'm just trying to sit here and do a show.  He had to carry a measuring cup when he fucked. 
[01:14:00]  Just so he could cum in that and fill it and dump it out the window.  Just loads of cum.  It's so embarrassing.  Filling up poor girl's eye sockets with load.  Just gotta like, he's just gotta jerk off every five minutes to get rid of the poison.  It just keeps producing and producing and producing.  When he comes in a girl's mouth, Anthony's what they call a three-swallower.  He'd give you three fucking mouthfuls and you gotta swallow.  It's like eating fucking smooth chowder.  It sounds like the girl's in a beer drinking competition. 
[01:14:30]  She's swallowing his dirty, huge load.  You can actually see his sperm like tadpoles.  Are we done?  They're like fucking eels.  You want to make a fucking sushi.  His sperm is actually not even clear.  It actually has like a color, like a gray color.  All right, good.  It's finally over.  Thank you, Paul.  We'll start it back up.  We'll start it right back in.  Absolutely.  When he comes, it looks like a snake trying to swallow a mouse. 
[01:15:00]  It looks like you took a garden hose and filled it with milk.  He's trying to fucking...  I bet you he can come without touching it.  Like when he gets close, it probably just stands up.  It's very turgid.  And the fucking...  It just starts pumping on its own and little bits start leaky all the time.  And he has to just grab it.  And it's slick with pre-cum.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear that.  There you go.  There's his cock. 
[01:15:30]  I'm sorry.  It's just a fat cock.  It probably just has to continue regenerating itself.  What is it now?  Pieces are just missing from all the goodness it gets.  I must assure you there's no pieces missing.  His cock actually sheds once a month.  Pieces fall off of this space shuttle.  And it keeps on ticking.  He has cock skin skins around his house.  Like fucking one of those little bugs that curl up and shit. 
[01:16:00]  I'm happy.  I'm happy.  Pieces.  Let's do line of the day.  Sure.  Who gives a shit about the pets?  Especially when he shakes his big fat cock.  It sounds like a cicada.  Old cicada, Jimenez.  When he comes, it makes a noise.  People are suggesting, actually, I don't have a name on this, that the reason you drink a lot is because your cock is your designated drinker. 
[01:16:30]  He gets a heart on a wheel lock so he can't start the car.  Yeah, his dick is the club.  Oh, jeez.  It sounded like a percolator.  It sounded like you're a chemist.  You're a chemist.  Epstein or...  For me...  Yeah.  It's the sound Anthony's cock makes when it comes.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  Enough about the cock.  Cock gurgles.  Your cock hole has lips like a mother.  Your little bum chin on your dick.  When Anthony comes, it sounds like pea soup being dumped on tinfoil.  He's got to put tarp up all over the place because he doesn't want to mess up his brand new drapes.  Just shoot everywhere.  Looks like a Night Stalker murder scene with delicious cum.  He's got to focus or it just goes off like a garden hose after you turn it on. 
[01:17:30]  Looks like somebody had a pie fight.  It's the worst thing I've ever drank is psyllium husk.  You really don't like that.  Can I taste it?  I'm done, yeah.  I'll give you some.  Out of his ass.  That's what comes out of Anthony's cock.  Psyllium husk.  All right.  Pure psyllium husk.  Fucking Bobby.  Someone wants to know.  Chris asked from PA. 
[01:18:00]  I didn't pay attention to the instant feedbackers today.  I apologize, but I just caught this one.  Chris asked from PA, writes,  When Andrew's off in the toilet, how many times does he have to flush?  Psyllium husk makes a boy go duty.  It's a song I'm working on.  Let's go to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to know when Anthony comes, if his dick looks like a dead person being revival 
[01:18:30]  paddles.  Good one.  That, um.  God.  Yeah.  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  Just please walk away.  Jesus.  That was a psyllium husk of jokes.  Let's go to South Dakota.  Thank you.  What?  Hold on.  That got what it deserved.  I heard Anthony makes his girl wear arm floaties when she sleeps in the wet spot.  That is funny.  That is funny.  You know, how did we get here? 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  Your genetics.  I don't mean that.  Huge cocked Italian asshole.  Can you actually swim and cum?  Uh.  No.  Not me.  It would be just float.  You'd probably float due to the sodium content.  High salt.  It would be like the Great Salt Lake.  Mark B. in Ohio.  Ant's cock was attacking ships in Pirates of the Caribbean, too.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's all right. 
[01:19:30]  Do you wash your cocks separately?  He has to stand in the living room while it's in the shower.  Soap it up.  Singing.  I mean.  I want.  All it can do is whistle.  Yeah.  I mean, she doesn't want to get soap in the pee hole, so he puts the fucking cork from  a wine bottle in it.  He actually puts it.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  Steve Elsbury from Albany writes, when Anthony comes, his cock looks like Pat from Winocky 
[01:20:00]  in the Baby Bird video.  So, you know, people are fucking ruthless.  That's why Anthony has so many guns in case his cock fucking just goes ballistic one  day.  I'll shoot it?  So much of a time flying, I have to shoot it?  Starts leaving Darth Vader helmet prints all over the house, on the walls.  Starts waking up and doing things while you're asleep.  Yeah.  You hear slapping noise like.  It attacked a neighbor one night while you were sleeping. 
[01:20:30]  Well, now it's getting ridiculously big, isn't it?  It's sneaking outside, it's doing things.  Who doesn't love exaggerated humor, though?  I have to shoot it.  Exaggerated humor rules.  I'll say it does.  It's coming like a fat man vomiting up eggnog.  It's wonderful.  He can't even wash it properly.  I bet your aunt's cock by the head smells like the underside of a foot.  Oh, God.  Use lead bag from my whack bag. 
[01:21:00]  And shits out peanuts, peanuts, as his cock constantly tries to feed it.  Shoving hay up his own ass.  That fucking, that gift, with that fucking fleshy gift.  Cog looks like an old sea turtle shell.  Fucking barnacles on the helmet.  God-given piece of enjoyment.  You want exaggerated humor, here you go.  Steve P. from New Hampshire. 
[01:21:30]  And his cock has a rotating light on the end of it, so ships won't crash into his balls.  It's not bad.  His cock has become self-aware.  Self-aware.  Hello, Joshua.  It's sperm of the size of trout.  And his cock bear hang out at the end, plucking it out of the stream to eat.  Steve, you mean.  Yes, Steve-o-moor. 
[01:22:00]  Ant's cock starred in Little Shop of Horrors as the plant.  Enough about the cock.  Shester's liver, Anthony's Escalade, came with a free horse trailer for his cock.  Ant's cock killed a gay guy.  What?  That's a horse joke.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering.  I love the horse.  Was he gay?  No.  No.  He wasn't.  He liked that male horse to fuck his ass, but he was somehow hetero. 
[01:22:30]  Figure that one out, gang.  Back to you.  Well, we could do this for another half hour, bud.  Yeah, bud.  But, uh...  I think it's blowjobs.  Enough about the cock.  Oh, my God.  I've got to go to this one.  Shane in Tennessee.  Go ahead.  When Anthony gets a blowjob, does it look like somebody blown into a didgeridoo?  Legally loggy.  Legally loggy. 
[01:23:00]  It had potential.  Old didgeridoo cock.  Yeah.  Didgeridoo.  This is actual audio of Anthony getting blown.  That's right here.  Oh, fuck.  Hey, there could be worse things.  We could be doing an hour on how tiny your cock is.  That's right.  We're doing you a service, my friend.  That's right.  A didgeridoo.  Oh, no.  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia Beach.  Kevin. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, when Anthony dies, we're going to count the rings on his cock.  Yeah, what he was.  That's good.  Tim in Westchester.  Yeah, I was wondering if Anthony's house looks like the movie Alien with all that goo all over the planet.  Jesus.  Here's your...  Spunkmeyer.  Get up here.  Anthony has a sleep number bed, and he likes it on 16.  His cock likes a 30.  That's how he tested it.  Like, instead of dropping the bowling ball with the wine glass on the other side, he just smashed his fat, delicious appendage into the fucking top of the bed. 
[01:24:00]  And he knocked the wine glass over.  I thought game was over, but I got to call game on.  Oh, come on.  Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  We'll do this until they fall flat.  Go ahead, Fred.  Aunt Lazy's cock in the gutter to go bumper bowling.  Ryan at PA.  Ryan. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Ann has to notify the FAA when he gets a hard on.  Now, that would be implying my dick would be so big that airplanes might hit it.  Small airplanes.  See, now it's gotten to the point of complete ridiculousness.  Well, Dave in Chicago.  Dave.  Yeah, I was wondering if Anthony was young, if they used his coming cock to whitewash defenses?  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  Frunkus?  All right.  I think we might be going.  Frunkus?  Out of the day.  We might be going.  Chris in Atlanta.  Chris? 
[01:25:00]  Aunt's cock so big, there's snow on top of it.  All right, see, now he's saying that it's as big as a mountain that has snow on its peaks.  All right.  And, guys, that's not, that's not, don't exaggerate.  Aunt's cock is so big that when you hold his balls, the tip of it rests halfway up your forearm and you just go, my God.  But you don't yell at you, you just say jelly. 
[01:25:30]  Hopefully not in that voice.  Yeah, exactly.  My God.  Can we fit the word comesies into this whole bit?  It's too cute.  When aunt makes comesies.  Aunt's cock is so big it has, like, scars on it, like a whale.  What?  When boats are hitting it?  Just scrapes from girls' teeth, smashing into his cock because it doesn't fit.  Coral?  Coral reefs?  Let me ask you honestly, have you ever had a doctor, like, when you go for the ball check, like, when you take your dick out,  have you ever had a doctor, like, like, kind of lean back a little bit and go, sweet Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  The doc sits on his balls like a hippity hop or a hoppity hip, whatever the fuck that thing is.  No, that has never happened, Jimmy.  Have you ever had a doctor start to say something and then catch himself, like, as soon as your cock is out?  Oh, this is Anthony's cock.  I've been practicing medicine.  It's not on Ellen right now.  There's an anaconda on Ellen, and it's not an anaconda.  Well, we were confused for a second.  Matt in D.C., what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if that was Ant's cock in the Kevin Bacon movie, Tremors? 
[01:26:30]  No, what happens is Anthony caught a doctor one time, like, he took his cock out for the ball check,  and the doctor said, I've been practicing medicine for 25 years and just stopped.  He just stopped himself.  Realized what he was saying?  He realized he was supposed to be thinking that.  Did you ever use your cock for T-ball?  No, I can say never.  This is a good one by Matt Lafar from Queensbury. 
[01:27:00]  Ant was circumcised with Alzar Cowey's knife.  Chris P. from Jersey, Ant has to lock his cock in the basement during full moons.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I got to pee.  Yeah.  Why don't you just pee inside that ant's cock?  Me and my cock have to go to court.  Well, Puddle of AIDS writes that your cock has mile markers.  Is that true?  No, it doesn't have mile markers. 
[01:27:30]  It would have to be over two miles long, I guess, to need a mile marker.  Ant's cock is not like, it's not any human thing.  But ant's cock, here's the reaction.  A lot of times a girl will get her hand on it, and she'll strain and strain, and she'll go,  oh, if I go up by the tip, I can touch my fingers.  That's all.  And no, I don't have to go to court so the judge can use it as a gavel.  Good luck at court there.  Oh, thanks.  That's why they're pretty sure today, right?  No, I brought clothes with me. 
[01:28:00]  You brought court clothes?  I brought court clothes.  Not, you know, up for murder charges, court clothes.  Just neat.  But you don't want to look like you're a felon or something.  Ant's pee hole is so big, it looks like a cornucopia.  There are various vegetables tumbling out of it.  Just rest your huge mule on the table at Thanksgiving.  And different colored corn cobs.  Matt from Pest Box Live says, 
[01:28:30]  Ant's cock has a grounds crew to keep it from knocking down streetlights.  This is silly.  I'll try one.  Ant's cock is so big that the crabs are as large as lobsters.  No, I don't have crabs.  But if you did, they would be the size of lobsters.  No.  You need light sticks to pee.  The girls just, you hear a beep, beep, beep.  They don't have to guide it in like an aircraft. 
[01:29:00]  God.  You do get a big mule, huh?  Is it a big, just admit to it and we might stop.  I just, you know, I'm not going to make judgments on my own anatomy as compared to anyone else.  Top Gunt from Canada wants to know if you use a tractor tire for a cock ring.  Tractor tire?  Not even just a tire.  Tractor tire.  When it was circumcised, they used his foreskin to cover the Superdome. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Ah, dude, I can't give you credit because it updated.  Fuck, that was good, too.  That was a great one.  Ah, shit.  Sorry, bro.  They're coming in so fast, I'd lost you already.  That wasn't mine.  Yes, I know.  And all they are here on Pal Talk is cock references.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Jurassic Come from IRF, he writes, rednecks go noodling inside Ant's pee hole.  That's a good one.  Noodle.  Chip, he went to the bathroom, he's back, and it's still going on. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Some guy just wrote, all right, we get it.  He's got a big cock.  That's a great way to end it.  No, the way to end it is, all right, we get it.  He's got a gift.  See, that's what that is.  Ant's cock is so big, it won't take Spielberg's calls.  Raw in Jersey.  Hey, wait a minute.  These are turning into Chuck Norris jokes.  Well, that's okay.  Ant's cock so big, he gets XM for free.  All right, finally. 
[01:30:30]  Let's just end it right there on that bomb.  You need to finish it.  All there's what?  Well, how about we try to get back on track with Casper from Connecticut.  Good evening.  Anthony, your cock is bigger than U.S. Steel.  Very good Godfather II reference.  Very nice.  All right.  Anthony likes the cruise vacations.  What?  You like the cruise ship vacations since he uses the portholes as glory holes. 
[01:31:00]  Johnny is from Montreal.  I just want to get that.  Pat from Putnam.  Pat?  Ant's cock is so big, his legs are jealous.  Cool.  All right.  How do we end this?  He has a toenail on his cock.  Oof.  That was all right.  So big it has its own zip code.  Yes.  And that's how you executive produce. 
[01:31:30]  What?  Ah, it's a long story.  Yeah.  Long and tragic.  Like your cock.  I knew it.  I knew it.  Hey, Jared from West Virginia writes, Bob Kelly.  Well, Ant's cock is so big.  Yes.  Of course you start with that.  Bob Kelly uses Anthony's cock to go, what was it?  Snooba?  Snooba diving?  Snooba.  You and your stupid snooba.  Snooba.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop.  Hook your mouth right onto the head of his cock. 
[01:32:00]  And you can go around, you can go down around 20 feet for a half hour.  Oh, shit.  What did I say?  Liberty.  What?  For my diabetes supplies.  There you go.  I got diabetes and I'm a big fat fuck with a walrus mustache.  Look at him.  I wish he'd fall backwards into that fireplace and crackle like a fucking sugar-filled marshmallow.  It looks like your cock before it gets hard. 
[01:32:30]  My cock does not look like Wilford Brimley.  Big and fat with a sweater.  It doesn't have diabetes.  It has to have its own sweater to keep it warm.  Jesus Christ.  Enough about the cock.  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts, both from the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, it's not often nowadays when we have a porn star in studio, but this time we have two. 
[01:33:00]  Brie Olsen and Caden Cross.  What's going on here?  They stop by.  Brie Olsen is a longtime friend of the show.  She's been doing the show for probably a couple years now and she is down for whatever.  And she was certainly down for anything in this appearance.  And by anything, we mean Black Earl.  Yes, Earl's first experience with a woman.  And he did not like it.  Right here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts, both from the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, it's not often nowadays when we have a porn star in studio, but this time we have two.

Yes, Earl's first experience with a woman.  And he did not like it.  Right here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst.  It's so good.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:34:00]  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  Hey, we got some hot.  It's hot that night.  Are we allowed to call them porn stars?  I don't know where we're at.  Some adult film stars.  Some get mad when you call them porn stars.  How about just adult film?  Let's call them helpers.  People help.  Do they come in?  People help.  People that help get the poison.  I'm very excited.  Did you walk over with them, Jimmy?  I haven't been here with them.  Of course I did.  What were the guys?  Did you just watch guys gawking?  I was just chatting with Brie Olsen.  No, no.  Were you watching guys just gawking at them?  Were the guys just uncontrolled?  I didn't look. 
[01:34:30]  I'm sure they were.  See, I would have done a social experiment and just looked at the guys looking at these  girls because they probably would have tripped over their own dicks.  The only guy I looked at looking at the girls was the fucking creep, that Mr. Whipple-headed  guy who I suspect is a pederast.  He just stares at everybody when we walk in.  He's obsessed with our show.  Like the guy at the sushi place.  He's the worst.  There's a guy.  Why'd they move her?  Yeah, why'd they move her?  What the hell?  I'm fucking married.  I got excited.  I couldn't breathe correctly. 
[01:35:00]  She was sitting right next to me and now she's way over there.  Now you're just made my reality, reality.  Just far away.  Hi, miss.  I'm divorced and I'm afraid that it's just going to be desperation in my eyes right now.  Yeah, Mark's going through a very tough time.  Very tough time.  Yeah, very tough time.  I'll be all right, though.  I'm going to be okay.  Tough times.  That's the look you're seeing in his eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the pain.  Despair.  Don't you guys want to melt this ring down for anything?  What do you mean?  That's his wedding ring and he wants you to melt it, saying that he doesn't want to be 
[01:35:30]  married anymore, gazing upon your beauty.  What do we want to do with that wedding ring?  I've got some ideas.  What do you mean?  Put it in.  Oh, God.  Oh, you've got to love Ohm's sick mind.  I've got some ideas.  It's for the show, though.  You can tell her it was for the show.  Yeah, it's for the show.  And then it comes back a different color.  Yeah, well.  Adult film star?  Yes.  Yeah.  That's me.  Jiminy Cricket.  Adult film star, Brie Olson.  And we also have Caden Cross here. 
[01:36:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Are you the more shy of the two, Caden?  Always.  Why are you so shy?  I'm not sure.  You sound like De Niro.  I know.  She's actually a better interview than he is already.  That fucking mumbling idiot he is.  The 9-11.  De Niro stinks.  It wasn't the 10th.  Thank you, stupid.  I don't get shyness, because you're naked, and that doesn't bother you as far as being  shy, but something like this is like...  Yeah, like I can walk naked down, you know, fucking Fifth Avenue, and I couldn't... 
[01:36:30]  Really?  Okay, let's go with that.  Isn't that weird?  I love it, though.  I love that she's shy.  I mean, I love a confident girl, but, you know, a nice shy one, and it's just, hey,  yeah, and then she takes her clothes off, and then she takes her clothes off, and punches  you in the face, calls you a faggot.  Do you do hardcore porn, or do you do softcore?  Yeah, I do hardcore.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Jimmy, what is the definition of hardcore porn?  Hard cocks in mouth or in vagina, I would say. 
[01:37:00]  Money shots.  Money shots.  And probably open vagina licking, I would say they don't show in softcore, do they?  I hate that.  Yeah, if you can see money, I think it's hardcore.  What's that?  If you can see pink.  Oh, okay.  Ass licking, things like that.  That is, yeah.  But then softcore, you mean like hotel room porn?  Sure.  Where you're sitting there like, just move the camera, move.  Yeah.  They keep panning back to the guy's dumb face.  You know what?  They're about to show a blowjob.  Worst fucking thing ever is when you're trying to scrap one out, and they go to the guy's  face going like, ugh.  And then they get the same shot again.  I don't want to see that.  There's no girls fucking masturbating to this, or a very small percentage, let's say. 
[01:37:30]  Like, mostly guys in a hotel room jacking it.  And then they got to show the guy's face.  Why?  The angle of the guy's asshole and peach slapping.  Oh, the bob shot we call that.  Back of balls?  You know his asshole.  It's just balls slapping.  And you know his asshole had some shit in it, because it just all wrinkled.  Jesus, Bobby.  Wow.  There's a lady in the room.  Why the hell would you watch that anyway?  You suck the sexiness out of the room.  No kidding, Bobby.  Like a fucking spaceship.  No, that's what I meant. 
[01:38:00]  I was like, I don't like that shit.  I don't like when they show the fucking guy's asshole.  But once in a while, if you watch those softcore, they will show, like, a dick in the mouth for a few seconds.  They almost keep giving you these little treats.  They just show the hand, though.  They don't...  No, they'll show everything.  It's like a hardcore shot that was edited differently.  Why would anyone watch that in a hotel, unless they didn't have Wi-Fi at the hotel?  You can just go online.  Because it's all over the years.  Not now.  Not now you don't.  Yeah, it's getting better there, Bob.  This is good.  With the hot girls, we're first told them on September 11th, now we're analyzing pornography.  I know.  What do we do with the digital era?  Fools.  Let's get to know the girls.  What's the move you're known for, for everybody out there? 
[01:38:30]  The move?  Yeah, these girls, they've got a specialty.  I know.  Some girls squirt, some girls do.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  What's the one thing you do that you're known for?  Well, my goodness.  I've been in the industry for most two years now.  I came into the industry doing anal, doing all of that right away.  Jumped right in.  So I did.  I like that.  Go get her.  I jumped right in, doing everything.  And this past year, I won eight awards, seven of them Best New Starlets.  Wow.  Nice. 
[01:39:00]  And Adam and Eve, contract star.  And just been working on a lot of movies lately.  We just did Roller Dolls, which you guys have some copies of.  Oh!  So that's a huge movie.  A lot of hotties in it.  Did you, before you got into the business, were you sexually promiscuous, maybe in school?  Oh, we heard her story.  I want to hear it again.  Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe more details.  Can't jerk off to that twice.  Like, you know, he's saying, you know, you jumped right in with anal and stuff like that.  Right.  Probably not the first time you had anal on set. 
[01:39:30]  It was on set.  I mean, maybe a boyfriend or something.  Right.  I don't think you remember, because when she tells the story, you're going to really appreciate it.  Can we do this interview?  Because I remember this one.  I'm new to the story, so I'd like to hear it.  Can we do the interview with the table up?  You said that you were underage.  I remember underage and having sex with a much older guy.  Like, he was really a lot older.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Really?  Like how much older?  You were underage.  Can I say how old you are?  Sure.  You probably don't want me to say how old you are.  Yes, we do.  No, you can.  Yes, we do.  Okay, I was 12.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  And how old was the gentleman?  In his 20s.  Wow.  How'd you meet this guy?  He lived across the street.  He was a Jehovah Witness.  Had he been courting you since you were six?  A Jehovah's Witness.  Did you know he was a Jehovah's Witness?  Yeah.  Wow.  And people found out he got kicked out of his church, and he lost his fiancee and everything  else.  Oh, he had a fiancee?  I didn't look 12, though.  I really did.  I looked 16.  All he said was, it was all worth it.  Yeah.  So he came over with some Watchtower magazines? 
[01:40:30]  You know, I mean, girls these days, they look, you know, I developed early, and I wore  the makeup and everything, and I was really asking for it.  Holy shit, you were asking for it.  The rest are real, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Did he get in trouble, though?  Yeah.  Did he get in trouble?  Did you get in trouble?  How did anyone find out?  Nothing legal.  Nothing legal.  Your parents are nothing?  We were all in the filth bags.  We are.  How could he avoid getting in trouble?  How could he have kept it a secret?  Yeah.  How did people find out?  Well, I had a boyfriend that was about my age at the time, and I wanted to lose my virginity,  but he was still too scared, because he was a virgin as well. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, I hate that.  So I cheated on him with this 20-something-year-old guy and lost my virginity to him instead, and  I ended up making my confession, and so he went and threatened that guy and told his  church and everything.  He threatened a 12-year-old?  No.  Oh, the 12-year-old threatened him.  Oh, okay.  So was it good?  Yeah, I loved it.  You did?  I loved it, yeah.  Well, obviously.  And I kept coming back from war, too.  Oh, you did?  So, yeah.  How many times did he fuck you?  Several. 
[01:41:30]  Several times.  Did he do anything like, did you suck his dick?  Of course.  And did he fuck you in the ass?  No.  No.  You saved that for later.  She was 12.  Yes.  She's sucking dick and getting fucked at 12.  The ass is off limits?  You're checking this off like it's a fucking subway worker.  All right, did he lick your shit or no?  Fuck your tits?  No.  What did the guy say?  Hey, I have morals.  I'm not going to fuck her in the ass.  No, no, no.  But her hiney at that age was probably not prepared for a little hiney.  Still Gerber's coming out of it.  It was a tiny little hiney.  Where would you?  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Well, but she don't feed hiney.  Sorry, go ahead.  They put me in the ass.  I was only 12.  Where would you do it, though?  At your house, his house?  Yeah, just when my parents weren't home or at his house.  So he would come to your house.  Well, we lived right across the street from each other.  But you lived with your parents.  That must have fucking freaked him out.  It must have been such a turn on thinking your parents are going to come up the driveway  in a second.  It smelled like bubblegum and homework.  It was so hot, though, because, I mean, he was like this executive, like, all in a  suit and glasses.  At 20?  Yeah.  20-somethings. 
[01:42:30]  I mean, like 26, 27.  He'd show up in a suit with his glasses?  Yes.  Well, he wore it a lot because, you know.  His white glasses with the fake eyes that come out.  Those two witnesses, they went to church, like, Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays.  He was at church all the time, so he's always dressed up.  What does he say when he was talking to a 12-year-old?  His name was Chris Hansen.  I love that show.  Yeah, I bet you do.  You're rooting for the guy.  So come on.  Go for the cookies.  Let him go.  Your breasts are real. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, sir.  Well, no, I just, I, I've done the fair cancer.  Can I just guess what size they are first?  Yeah, sure.  First.  It's a 30, 34 C.  No, D's.  34 C.  Are they D's?  Yes.  Cares.  Let her show them.  Fuck.  D's or C's?  What do you think now?  Holy fuck-a-rony.  Can I just say something?  I mean, honest to fucking God, those are just the best fucking motherfucking tits ever.  Goddamn microphones are on the way.  There's no way to say it.  There's no way to talk, Bob.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Those are just, those are goddamn. 
[01:43:30]  I'm on it, you fucking sons of bitches.  They're all yelling at me on pal talk.  And you know what's great is your nipples are just perfect, too.  Your areolers.  I like how.  Areolers.  Thank you.  They're a little fucking, they're a little, what are you, a doctor?  You're supposed to go on fucking light switches.  Holy mackerel.  Dude, I did that.  I said, holy fucking cunt fuck shit.  Do you want to suck them, baby?  Yeah, I can't.  I'm fucking married, and I want to suck them.  Ask me one more time.  Are you wearing underpants?  No.  You don't have, fuck, I gotta go.  I have to go.  I have to go.  I'm going to piss my jeans right now. 
[01:44:00]  Wow.  Last time she, well, she is fucking.  We've got to make another video today, because when we make videos with you, wow, we get  some views.  I think the last video.  Is this the girl who.  Yes.  This is her?  Yes.  Dude, this show.  The last video we made with her got over a million views all over, I think it was break.com  on that one.  She has a very lovely hiney, if you don't mind me saying that.  What can we do?  Thank you.  I said we'd get Joe Businessman off the street and just bring him up here and give him the surprise  of his life.  That's kind of what I was thinking it was, except I hope we get Jim Norton's face sat 
[01:44:30]  on it.  Joe Businessman works as well.  I mean.  Dude, but you should get somebody with a ring.  Yeah, you're going to do that on video.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Put a bag on his face.  Put someone on the street.  Put a bag on him.  Hold on, hold on.  What would you do with Joe Businessman if we got him up here right now?  I don't know.  It depends.  We want to work within your limits.  I'd fuck him.  Whoa.  Really?  All right.  Why not?  She's so great.  I fucking love her. 
[01:45:00]  And Shy One, I love you too.  I love you, Shyness, because I know it.  Yeah, we don't know much about your story.  Yeah.  I don't have stories like that.  That's why.  No?  You just got into the business.  How long have you been in the business?  A year and a half.  Jesus.  A year and a half.  You fucking ghoul.  Santa Claus is here.  Look at this creep.  Santa Claus is here.  Put something in there.  What do you get?  I brought stuff to put in there.  They opened Pat Duffy's duffel bag.  Jesus.  I forgot this guy's name, but he just came out with a sex toy.  How about she straps that fucking strap-on on and fucks it in the ass? 
[01:45:30]  This is a strap-on.  Of course it's a strap-on.  Come on, Bobby.  You've seen that before.  For rookies.  Not this big.  And he's never seen it.  It's always been behind him.  Exactly.  He's got his hair on it.  And it's never been white.  And it's never been a strap-on.  That's right.  And it's never been that small or thin.  It didn't have straps.  No.  Exactly.  He just had hips and a guy torso.  Fleshy straps.  And a hairy chest.  We've got to get a video.  Oh, shit.  We've got to get a video made today.  We can get a guy with a fucking...  Yeah, put a bag over his head or something.  Give him a...  Do something, whatever he wants. 
[01:46:00]  A lap dance.  A lap dance?  I've never gotten one.  I think there's...  You've never gotten a lap...  Isn't it your birthday?  No.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Good improv.  Never deny.  I know.  What were you saying?  What?  Sam was saying that if we bring somebody up off the street, we do have a spare bunny  mask we can put on.  Oh.  That is anonymity.  We'll look like The Shining.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you know how many O&A fans are just running to walk by the street?  Just putting a suit on?  Yeah, just putting a suit on and just walking back and forth. 
[01:46:30]  Would you...  You're married?  Look at that big guy right there.  Look, he's fucking...  That is fantastic.  You, sir, the galoot.  Yeah.  The one taking up the whole bench.  Yeah, we got that...  Oh, that's fantastic.  We got the black Marty Feldman.  I mean, how are we not working with fucking one of these guys?  Look at the guy in the kilt.  Look at the guy in the front, too.  My buddy in the kilt.  The little Boston guy with his wife.  Right here.  This guy, yeah.  What about you, sir?  You know.  Now you can't do it?  Because your girl's right there?  Well, how about our fucking mess intern?  What if she gave you permission?  Would you do it?  I say we go with Joe Businessman with a ring. 
[01:47:00]  Danny, go down the street.  Let's feel this out, at least.  All right.  Call the show and talk to guys walking by with wedding rings.  Yeah.  Tell them we might have a special...  I want to see if these guys can be touched.  But make sure it's not a good wedding ring with a lot of diamonds and they have a lot of money.  Make sure it's like a shitty wedding ring.  You know he's depressed.  He's got no money.  He needs it.  Like a rusty, fucked up wedding ring.  All right.  Why don't you go downstairs?  Should I bring Sam to get the video on the street?  Yeah.  Or is that too conspicuous, you think?  No, Sam.  We'll see if the guy minds being a video. 
[01:47:30]  They're not going to document the whole thing.  I would be amazed if someone comes up on the street.  If not, we've got an intern.  Would you?  I'd be fucking amazed if they didn't.  Oh, my gosh.  Really?  Yeah.  I want to pee before this happens.  In a second.  Yeah, I got to pee, too.  I have to pee before it happens.  Because if any cum comes out, then it hurts if I haven't peed yet.  Do you ever jerk off and then pee and it hurts?  Because the cum is like...  What happened?  Well, Sam was mentioning, yes, if we should bring Brie so that they can see what they're  getting.  Or maybe we print that a picture or something.  No.  No.  I think we...  Bring the box down because anything in front of the fucking door... 
[01:48:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  I got to try and take a shit.  Are you going to pee right now, Jimmy?  Can I come?  I'm going to go pee with Jimmy.  Everyone's peeing.  What is this?  Me and Jimmy are going to suck each other off just to...  Oh, God.  Does that work within your marriage if you blow Jimmy?  Yeah, I can blow Jimmy.  Okay.  I did.  I hit it already.  Unbelievable.  This one?  I got to try and take a shit.  I love that one.  Hey, Marc Maron, what are you thinking?  What are you thinking over there?  I'm thinking just how important porn has been in my life over the last 25 years.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  You're like...  You help out.  Yeah.  I really do.  Girls.  Beg a helper.  I try.  He's having sex with a black sock these days.  Oh, that was once and I just didn't prepare.  What are you...  I don't know of any guy who hasn't scrapped into their sock at one point in their life.  I don't know what it is with guys that they can't just prepare.  Like, you know you're going to do it.  Bring a towel, washcloth, some Kleenex.  What, you got to dig into the hamper like an ass?  Sometimes you're going for the quickie just to get it over with.  Like you're surprising yourself.  Like, who knew I was going to do this? 
[01:49:00]  Or someone's home, maybe.  After I plowed through a pint of Ben and Jerry's.  What a pathetic night that was last night.  You fucked some Ben and Jerry's?  No, I didn't.  I ate the Ben and Jerry's.  I assumed you were fucking your ice cream.  I ate the Ben and Jerry's and that wasn't enough.  You understand?  Oh, my God, yeah.  But I didn't go onto the computer.  I didn't use any of your services.  That's kind of girl-like.  I went with my mind.  Not insulting you, but that's kind of girl-like.  Like, your emotions taking it out by eating ice cream.  I'm not embarrassed about my feminine side.  I'm not wearing wigs or getting fake boobs.  I'm eating ice cream.  Is that so horrible?  No, I guess, you know. 
[01:49:30]  But that's like kind of a girl thing.  I sat all night and just ate ice cream.  I felt bad.  All right, so I had some food issues.  Is that going to be a problem?  No, not at all.  I still jerk off into a sock.  Does that account for anything?  That's more manly.  Okay, all right.  Anthony, people are confused.  They think this is our 9-11 tribute show.  It is.  It was.  It started that way and everything changed.  We're trying to make people forget.  I know the thing is never forget.  We want people to forget just for a little while.  Well, where can people see you guys, too?  Because Bree is fucking a trooper, man.  Both of them, man.  I'm saying as a personality, I don't know her. 
[01:50:00]  It kind of is because she didn't get fucked at 9 or 11.  Right.  She was fucked at 12.  Kind of a tie-in.  I feel like I'm out of the loop with professional porn.  I find myself looking at all the amateur bullshit porn.  I've got to get up to speed.  That's my favorite kind, though.  Me, too.  I love amateur porn.  Five minutes of amateur porn is great.  I don't know who any of these people she's talking about.  I like classic.  I love the classic.  I love the scenario.  It was on film.  Like when women had hair on the top.  Stop.  Big fucking hairy back in the day.  Yeah, yeah.  Back in the day.  Hey, son. 
[01:50:30]  Can you come here and help me with this plant?  Dad.  Where half of the time he's eating pussy is spent with those fingers pulling hair away.  Yeah.  Like trying to find it.  Oh, man.  And then you'll look at it.  It's like roadkill.  It looks like fucking 13-day roast beef.  It just has that rainbow on it.  It's like fucking Reginald Denny's head.  When I was 14, and I grew up in New Mexico, and everybody, you got your driver's license  when you're 15 in Albuquerque.  So we all had fake IDs at 15, and we all had the same fucking name on the ID, because 
[01:51:00]  the guy who made them would come with a board that you'd hold in front of your head at a  party, right?  It's the same fucking...  So it was all the same information.  And we go to this place called the Pyramid Theater, which was this porno theater.  We had four 15-year-old guys, all of us Tom Bynes.  And we walked in.  Yeah, Tom Bynes.  And I remember seeing the first porno I saw, it must have been like, I don't know when  it was made, in the mid-70s.  And all I know is it ended with a woman on a...  It had some sort of weird occult theme to it. 
[01:51:30]  And some guy was on a bus, and some woman picks him up, and they go back to her apartment,  and she takes her clothes off, and she's got the face of the devil tattooed to where the  pussy is the devil's mouth.  And the guy's fucking her, and she's going, fuck me, fuck Satan.  And I'm 15, and I'm like, is this how it goes?  Is this how...  Am I missing something?  Is this who I have to look forward to?  Who put the fucking History Channel on?  They're showing 9-11.  Put something else.  We said change the channel, so they go to the History Channel.  I don't want to see the buildings.  Good odds that the History Channel would have something on this today. 
[01:52:00]  It's called the History Channel.  Yeah.  I'm amazed that the post didn't do nothing on it.  That was amazing, that the post didn't have a cover story.  Putting a picture of a pig with lipstick on.  I like the old pornos, but some of the guys...  There was a guy named Arbola, who was a porn star.  He was in a lot of them, and he looked like fucking Robert Duvall.  He was balding in his 40s.  I remember that guy.  He was the worst.  Who were the other ones?  Mark Wallace, Tom Byron?  Mark Wallace has the hiv.  He's done, right?  Is he dead?  Yeah, he's got the virus.  Tom Byron, I actually met. 
[01:52:30]  He's got a gut now.  He's a big Tough Crowd fan.  He's got a fucking goatee.  Like, Peter North looks the same.  He's still fucking shooting.  Really?  Like, eight gallons of jizz.  Oh, he's got a fucking...  Oh, that fucking intimidating cock he has.  Who's that guy that's a real evil guy?  Not...  What's a...  Max Hardcore.  Who's that guy?  His little hat and his little feet.  Hey!  Who's the dude that was in opening?  I'm a good sports fan.  Opening of Misty Beethoven.  What was that guy's name?  Jeremy...  Oh, shit.  Did you ever see that movie?  Opening of Misty Beethoven?  Did you ever see the one...  I forget who it was.  Ginger Lynn, I think it was. 
[01:53:00]  She was...  Her boyfriend...  Yes!  Her boyfriend was a comic.  And he was bombing at this hell gig.  She's in the back getting fucked and sucking dick by the other two guys while he's on there  bombing.  And then he comes off and knocks on the door.  He's like, honey...  Like, you know, wants to talk about his set.  Wow.  How bad it went.  And she goes, close your eyes.  I'm going to do that thing to you that you've always liked, but keep your eyes shut.  And the guy finishes on her ass and they sneak out right past him.  And then he goes in with his eyes closed.  And she's still got jizz on his ass. 
[01:53:30]  That's my biggest fear in comedy.  I'm going to be up at the cellar one night bombing.  And your boyfriend will knock on the door?  And then you'll...  And then you'll open it.  You're losing the girls.  Yeah, I know, right?  She backed off from the mic.  You got a...  Don't fucking blame me.  What are you doing?  Trying to add to the fucking show.  I'm not on you.  I was just thrown off by the Sesame Street a little bit.  Well, you know why?  Because 9-11 ain't going to be on Sesame Street.  Okay.  You're watching the first time she was...  Yeah, when she was 12.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, where's Danny?  I thought he was going to be on the street.  He's supposed to be bringing the people up here.  You're one of those stars that have, like, a boyfriend-husband thing?  Because that's always odd to me.  No.  No?  No.  Oh, good girl.  What about you?  I'm available.  Why don't you talk to her?  Her honey is so...  You can't do it?  What happens?  I can't have boyfriends.  It's impossible.  Really?  Because when they get a little jealous?  It's not even a jealousy thing.  It's just...  Well, it's timing.  I mean, we work constantly, right?  Yeah.  Do you ever fuck a married guy?  Never, actually.  Unless a porn star. 
[01:54:30]  I'm sure there's a couple married guys.  But you never would, like...  You never fucked, like, a legit married guy, like a square.  No.  Would you?  It must be...  Imagine, because you...  Could you go out with a porn star, though?  I mean...  Abso-fucking-fuck yes.  My buddy used to go out with a dominatrix, and they'd be out to dinner, and her page would  go off, and she'd go, oh, I gotta go piss on this banker's head.  Hilarious.  How great is that?  It's hilarious.  I'll be back in an hour.  I'd buy her the Fiji water.  Would you?  Fuck yeah. 
[01:55:00]  I dated a girl who did some porn in L.A. It didn't bother me at all.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  It's kind of like cuckold, though, isn't it?  No, no, no.  Thank you.  No, I don't know.  Go down to the set and watch her work?  No, I didn't.  Hey, look, that's my girl sucking that dick.  No, no, no.  That ain't mine.  That's better than like, yeah, okay, I'll watch the kid.  I'll see you when you come back.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  It didn't bother me.  We had very tender, nice sex.  Did you?  Yeah.  That's what she said?  No, I was.  We were kissing and loving.  What kind of sex do you like having, do you like having, you know, in your personal life?  It really just depends on the mood.  I like it all. 
[01:55:30]  Mm-hmm.  I would talk dirty.  I would say some sexy stuff, like, take that dick.  It seems like you'd want something a little different than, you know, what you do at work.  Yeah, that's true, and that's the case most of the time, but sometimes, you know, still.  Can I ask some novice questions, because I'm, like, new to this game here?  Now, the wee-wee goes in her wee-wee.  Okay, so that's how it starts?  Yes.  When you do movies, do you come, for real?  Yes.  I'm very, very sensitive.  Oh, yeah, every time.  Seriously?  Seriously.  Seriously.  I didn't at first. 
[01:56:00]  It was hard at first, because there's, like, you know, 15 people watching you.  Right.  But then you just kind of get in the zone, the come zone?  Yeah, I get to the point where I don't notice.  I've had them leave and come back, and I didn't know.  It just...  Wow.  My penis would wilt under that pressure.  Horribly.  I'm just happy to know that they do.  That's why I'm in a radio.  Face.  She's right.  Hey, let's see.  Face.  We got Danny on the street.  Let's see if he's had any luck.  Hey, Danny, what's going on?  That's a damn good point.  Not much, man. 
[01:56:30]  It's...  You know, I could never in a million years imagine it was this hard to pick a guy off...  Of course it is.  ...come get laid by a gorgeous porn star.  They don't believe it.  I'm really trying to sell this, and people think that they're...  They don't believe it.  I'm whipping out her picture.  I'm like, this girl is upstairs right now, and you could totally back her.  Danny.  Danny.  Can you tuck your hair into your hat?  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe it's you that's...  You look like a guy who just got kicked out of clown college.  You have Gallagher trying to sell pussy on the streets.  Yeah, I wouldn't come up with him either. 
[01:57:00]  Who would?  I think I was getting mugged.  You look like a porn star?  He just committed a sodomy?  Yeah.  No.  She's dead.  Yeah, you've got to send somebody down.  What about the guy in the kilt?  No underpants.  We saw him Kenny out here.  You want Kenny to do it?  Danny.  Yeah, Kenny.  What, she's not wearing underpants?  No.  Do you like being spanked?  Yeah.  I'm a very good spanker.  Yeah, Jimmy would like...  Can I smack you just for a second?  Yeah, you want to right now?  Okay, yeah, I'll show you how.  This is my technique.  You're all shaved?  You're all shaved?  Yeah.  Well, I kind of slacked because I'm not shooting right now.  That's kind of cool.  This is how I do it.  Okay. 
[01:57:30]  You straighten your arm.  Yeah.  And you go stiff like this.  That looks ridiculous.  That was the most...  Aggressively weird spanking you've ever had?  I didn't...  You know.  This is disturbing.  It was lovely.  It was lovely.  That's a great vision.  I like giving retard arm when I spank.  Yeah, I got it.  Danny, we want to hear you try to ask someone live on the show.  I can do that.  I'm really thinking this is probably going to work better if we had said goods out on the street.  All right.  Maybe Brie should go down then. 
[01:58:00]  I mean...  Hey, Brie, how about if you just openly ask these guys if you want to...  Is that any...  I got to find one that, like, meets the criteria.  I thought she's not naked.  What is...  Can I ask a question about one of our interns?  The guy who blinks a lot?  Yeah, what about...  Who is he?  I don't know.  He's...  Well, can we bring Ryan in?  We don't know anything about Ryan.  He's a disaster.  No offense.  A disaster.  You're a fucking mess, Ryan.  How old a boy are you?  We talked to him.  He's got, like...  Yeah, he's got some of that...  How big a penis do you have? 
[01:58:30]  Eh, it's average.  Nothing special.  That's confidence.  Have you ever gotten, like, a lap dance or anything from a girl like this?  I mean, I don't know if you would do it, but have you ever?  Because she's very beautiful and very sexually open.  I've gotten lap dances at strip clubs and stuff.  Not...  Girls that hot, but...  Have you ever wrestled a bear?  No, I have not.  When they say no, does it just make your dick harder?  Nothing on that?  All right.  Nothing on that.  Geez, I didn't mean it.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that could have backed you up, Dan.  I'm not sure. 
[01:59:00]  Because I'm thinking, we might get a guy off the street, but we should get things started,  and one of our own guys, I kind of feel bad that you're not going to get anything.  It's...  I don't know.  It's all right.  I don't really care.  Do you ever work at a chocolate factory?  No, I haven't worked.  So what do you mean it's all right?  Are you too nervous?  Well, what do you want me to do, really?  He's really missing the story.  You're an intern.  He wants you to learn.  Yeah.  What do you want me to do? 
[01:59:30]  Like a lap dance.  The big guy outside.  Yeah, I don't get a lap dance, I don't care.  Who's the big guy outside?  He wants in so bad.  Who's the non-homosexual?  This guy wants in so bad.  Non-homosexual.  Sir, and are you married?  Jesus.  Yes, sir.  You're a married man?  Married man, are you?  No, I am not.  Are you?  Mr. Grady?  Oh.  Jesus.  Wow.  Damn, you're a big boy.  Big boy.  No, I'm not married.  What do you do for a living, sir?  I work for a publishing company.  We actually did your book.  Did you?  Oh.  Yes, we did.  Wow.  The second one, too? 
[02:00:00]  There's a second one.  Oh.  Very, uh, not around the ball.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So you work for Simon?  We actually publish for Simon.  Okay.  So what is it?  You keep raising your hand.  Why are you raising your hand?  I'll take a lap dance.  If this guy won't do it.  Would you take a strap on in the ass?  No.  Why not?  We'll just see where we're at.  So serious about it.  Too outrageous.  No.  We'll just see where we're at.  All right.  Somewhere in the middle. 
[02:00:30]  I hope we really just fucking step on the gas.  We take a lap dance?  How about a fucking dick in your asshole?  Well, we're just trying to get the parameters, and then we work within the parameters.  That's all, Bobby.  Do you do strap-on stuff with girls, other girls?  Yes.  That's very sexy.  Would you ever put, like, the tip of a cock in your mouth if she was blowing you?  Jesus.  That is a fair question.  Like, if she's...  What's wrong, Bobby?  Bob's asking right now.  Just hang on.  I'm trying to make it a...  Is that a valid question?  I'm trying to make it a better show.  Why don't you fucking relax?  Just let it go down.  Let it flow. 
[02:01:00]  I'm sorry, Bobby.  I didn't mean to interrupt your homosexual fantasy.  Thank you.  I didn't know we needed help, Bobby.  Thank you.  So listen.  You two have engaged in, like, strap-on stuff with each other?  All right.  Now we're getting somewhere, too.  And you're comfortable with that?  We haven't actually done strap-ons with each other, but we've had...  We've had some sexy time, but no strap-ons.  Well, could I request a kiss or something?  Just because there's no sexiness in the show other than you two, and we have to get something  started because we're all kind of feeling homoerotic.  Bobby will show his hiney. 
[02:01:30]  He's got a spider bite on his hiney.  It's not as funny.  You'll show her your ass, Bobby.  You'll show us, but not the hot girls?  Yeah, absolutely.  You're fucking smoking, Opie.  I would love to see you guys kiss.  I mean, you guys...  First of all, you guys are just naturally beautiful, too.  You're not like that maid porno style.  You guys are just naturally hot chicks.  Aw, thanks.  I'd love to see you guys kiss.  It'd be, like, fucking amazing.  Could I see some cock to get me worked up a little bit?  Yeah, where's that big guy? 
[02:02:00]  Right behind you.  Oh, Jesus.  Can you get him out from behind you?  I have two inches right now.  Yeah, yeah.  I have an innie right now.  Aw.  Go ahead, over there, dude.  She wants to see your cock.  Show your inner, sir.  So what?  Make it happen.  Use the four-fingered fucking guitar trick.  He's pulling it out.  I'm going to look, too.  Yeah, Daddy.  Don't aim it towards you.  It looks like it does get fat, but...  It does.  All right, well, work it out. 
[02:02:30]  What are you packing when you're hard?  About six.  About six?  How do you need to get it hard?  What if she looks straight at it like a fucking...  She was naked.  Like a movie?  Absolutely.  She got naked?  Absolutely.  Didn't you just see her?  Bree's actually...  Bree's actually just fucking, like, moving her neck like a fighter.  She's fucking doing, like, necromics and fucking shadow parts.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  I'm just...  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, Bree, is it true you got a crush on someone in this room?  I'm sorry?  I'm hearing some communique that you might have a crush on someone in this room.  What?  Who told you that? 
[02:03:00]  Tell them to shut up.  Shut up.  This Bree Olsen has a crush on someone in this room.  Shut up.  Oh, my goodness.  Someone in this room right now.  Someone in this room she has a crush on.  It's Jimmy Norton.  It's always Jimmy.  It's got to be Jimmy.  Jimmy's the cutest.  It's Anthony.  It's got to be Anthony.  Oh.  Is it Anthony?  Bree, look at me.  Holy shit.  Bree, look at me.  She really has a crush on someone in this room.  Is it Anthony?  That's been confirmed, too, by the way.  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  Am I right?  I'm not saying anything. 
[02:03:30]  I think we found our bit.  Steve.  She's a little schoolgirl right now.  She's got a crush on someone in this room.  See her giggling?  I can't believe someone.  Who's tattling on me?  Who tattled?  You know.  We've got our ways.  That's so not nice.  You want to say it?  Uncle Paul, right?  You want to say who you got a crush on?  No.  Wow.  Hmm.  Who could it be?  Who could it be?  This is good radio. 
[02:04:00]  This is really good radio.  Because process of elimination.  Is it Opie?  No, it's not me, obviously.  I wouldn't be asking that question.  It's not Anthony.  Is it Marc Maron?  Oh, it's not me?  Fuck it.  Fuck this man.  This bit sucks.  Let's read her body language.  Is it Marc Maron?  Mm-hmm.  Is it Robert Kelly?  Mm-hmm.  Is it Jim Norton? 
[02:04:30]  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  She has a kind of good poker face.  Yeah, she's got a really good poker face.  You're going to keep on smiling at everyone.  She has no tells.  No tells.  No tells.  I just want to eliminate myself from this contest right off the get-go.  She has one tell that almost got a 25-year-old in big trouble.  Bobby needs to know it's not him.  I know it's not me.  He's freaking out inside.  I already know it's not me.  All right.  I just met her today.  Is it in this room right now, or did somebody leave?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Am I answering, or you've got to answer your question?  Not answering.  I don't know.  Yeah.  She's not saying she has a crush. 
[02:05:00]  Somebody's saying that.  She's not saying that.  Yeah, but she said, oh, my God, there's a tattletale.  Yeah, no, it's confirmed.  Do you know?  Yeah, I do know.  How do you know?  You don't know, no.  Yeah, I know.  What's your name again?  Your publicist might have said a thing or two.  Caleb?  Oh.  Hmm.  That's messed up.  Yeah.  She's going to get it when I get out of here.  Can we turn the 9-11 stuff off?  I can't see people crying and then them looking over here.  Just look at the TV on the bottom.  Yeah, she's waiting for Jehovah's Witness to come over. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  The Jehovah's Witness is at the door right now.  There's a little girl laying in a fucking clown nose.  Where's the Jehovah's Witness in the suit?  Yeah, she's just laying there under the beeswax.  And Al Pacino's laying there, sitting next to her.  Hey, how'd you get your shoes so high?  Look at her leg up.  Nice nose.  She's ready.  She's a little pervert.  Yeah.  Oh, look, she has Danny's hair.  Fucking awful white hair.  Well, Brie Olson has a crush on somebody, yes. 
[02:06:00]  A crush?  What is this?  Junior high?  That's how it was told to me, too.  A crush.  That's how it feels like in my heart.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  My God.  Well.  So what's going on in the street?  How could we find out?  Is there a way to...  That's what I'm...  I think we each individually go in an empty room with her.  For seven minutes in heaven? 
[02:06:30]  I think we play spin the bottle.  And while I'm kissing Jimmy...  For the full seven minutes.  We're just jerking each other off.  Just me and Opie knocking on the door.  We're not gay.  We had our hopes up.  Oh, shit.  How are we going to do this?  You got to tell this person you have a crush on him.  No, I don't.  I'm sure you do.  What kind of rule is that? 
[02:07:00]  That's not in the handbook.  What kind of rule is that?  That's a good rule.  It's the rule of life.  Where's the...  It's the rule of life.  Where's the publicist?  Are you the publicist?  Where's the publicist?  Just come to the door.  I like how Kaylin's so far away.  Yeah, why are you so far away?  They put me here.  Come on, move.  Steve really did not set the room up.  We were going to have...  Wait, wait.  We were going to have...  Yeah, I was supposed to be over there.  I want to confirm this.  That's Brie Olsen's publicist, right?  She's lovely.  She has a crush on someone in this room, right? 
[02:07:30]  I like the publicist.  She's lovely.  Oh my gosh, I'm getting fucked.  What?  Hey!  There we go.  Is that you?  Wow, that's...  I always spelled your name wrong.  Wow, whoever you have a crush on better fucking be packing.  Sorry, he's probably...  No, that...  That cock's his biggest alfacino.  I swear to God, I thought that was a fucking arm.  That's like...  That's barely moving in and out.  It's not even real.  That's fake.  It is fake, right?  Yeah.  When they have those giant, giant dick ones, you can always see... 
[02:08:00]  They hold it at the base.  Yeah.  And it's like that fucking awful fake...  You're giving away porn?  No.  That shit is real.  Most of them are, but these ones...  This is called combat, by the way.  Oh.  I'll watch...  Can I guarantee you there's a little hose in there that shoots a combat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a ridiculous amount.  Like it's like a shower.  Yeah, like a fire hose.  It looks like a honey bun.  Yeah.  You're using the wrong water fountain, boy.  I remember that day.  I do.  You do?  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  I would think you would.  That was... 
[02:08:30]  That was about...  How did you forget that?  You know...  You're getting a whiffball.  A lot of them I do forget, but that one was about two months into the industry.  I'd only been in about two months.  Wow.  Is that some sort of rites of passage, an initiation or something?  You know, it looks like it's really...  But really, it's only this much is in there, and it's just going back and forth like this.  About two inches.  Right now, we're sitting, by the way, on our hands and knees with her face in the bed.  There's a black guy putting what looks like a massive dick inside of Ernie, spanking  her, but apparently it's a fake penis.  It's very shiny.  It's too shiny. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  It's not going all the way in, and the base is too shiny.  You should not be able to see yourself in a cock.  What a...  It's too shiny.  You've got a great fuck-ass, though.  What a perfect ass.  That is just a great...  God bless you.  ...great fucking going on there.  I like the way her neck is bent all the way back.  And his big, dumb, shiny, fake, plastic penis is really...  Yeah.  Ain't even real.  Look at the fucking...  How perfect that ass is.  There you go.  It's Keith Robertson.  It's Keith Robertson.  God damn it.  I'll fuck you for Philly.  Philly. 
[02:09:30]  I don't pay for nothing.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Come bath?  Where's the come bath?  Wow.  Was that in your butt?  Oh, no.  It wasn't in my ass.  Look at...  Wow.  I probably would have taken it better in my ass than my pussy, though.  Oh, my God.  Look at my face.  I'm like, fuck this.  Where's the come bath?  Is that what that was?  Yeah, basically.  Fake rubber cock.  Now you're sucking on it.  Did that taste like a telephone?  Yeah, that's about what it tasted like.  That's how I would describe it.  How mad was that guy that he had to put a fake dick in your mouth while he's naked?  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  How embarrassing is that?  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  Come bath.  Oh, I got to see the come bath.  This is...  Watch it squirt out.  What is it?  What do they use?  Yeah, what do they use for that?  It's like a pina colada mix.  Who does that smell?  It is a Krispy Kreme machine.  That is so fucking impossible.  You know...  Jesus.  We're not watching this coming out.  It's ridiculous.  All right, now we know why it's called comeback.  Yeah.  Wait, the guy left the room.  The dick is still coming.  It's like the fucking...  This is just silly.  It's like the vomit scene in the fucking...  Yeah, Monty Python. 
[02:10:30]  No, I was thinking the other one.  Exorcist or...  No, I was thinking...  Meaning of life?  Is that sugar?  No.  Oh, the puppets.  Like pina colada mix.  Oh, um...  Yeah, yeah.  Team America.  Fuck me.  You guys would be surprised on how many people email me and say,  Hey, I seen you on this site.  Is that really real?  And, you know, people ask all the time.  That's crazy.  How many of the guys...  You got to dream those people.  That guy would...  If that was real, he would get a girl pregnant every time he's fucked.  Just shooting it up into a fucking...  And then give her an abortion immediately after. 
[02:11:00]  Fucking 13 twins stuck together.  We're getting away from the crush thing, and I can't let this...  Go.  And Brie, did you...  Why don't you eat your fucking yogurt now, Opie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can be funny.  Brie also said earlier that you're available and looking, right?  Uh-oh.  Remember the last time that happened?  Oh, yes.  Of course.  She said she's available and looking, and we just brushed by that, and we're also finding out that she has a crush on someone in this room. 
[02:11:30]  Mm-hmm.  Nothing.  What's wrong, Danny?  All right.  Danny?  People are gay.  They don't want to be laid.  Maybe they're just going to work.  Nobody wants to get laid.  That's okay.  I'd rather fuck my crush anyways, so...  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Motherfucker, no, you didn't.  Who the fuck?  Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.  Oh, shit.  Fucking nigga, please.  Somebody in this room?  Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.  Yes?  No? 
[02:12:00]  I love Danny saying that everyone's gay.  Well, maybe they have morals.  Or maybe they're just going to work.  Maybe they weren't anticipating that.  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.  Like, some guys are like, they're like, oh, I gotta go to a meeting.  I'm just like, what fucking meeting is more important than this?  Yeah, why not lose your job for this?  The best part about Danny down there was every time somebody said no, as they were walking away, while they were clearly still in earshot, Danny said,  They said no, it must be gay or something.  And homo said no. 
[02:12:30]  Of course, of course.  You got a crush on Sam.  No, that's obvious.  No, it was someone that was in the room already, I guess.  Well, Sam was in the room?  Yeah, but no, no, it was in the room at that moment, I think.  At that moment.  So I don't think it's Sam.  Danny?  Danny wasn't in the room.  You got a crush on Danny?  She keeps looking at the publicist, like, I'm going to kill you.  Maybe this is how we get something going.  Maybe you're, like, really shy and you would have never, you know, done anything with this crush.  You're probably right. 
[02:13:00]  That is so weird.  Can we just speed the crush up?  It's like everyone's holding their lottery tickets, but they're not giving the numbers out.  Nobody wants to open the Wonka bar and look for the golden ticket.  Yeah, because you can fucking, Grandpa has bed sores.  A bunch of guys are just going to be sitting here with chocolate bars and one is going to be, oh.  You did it, Charlie.  Balls deep.  Wow.  It's a little Jimmy Norton.  Is it? 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  It has to be said.  Yes.  It just has to be said.  I can't let this one go.  What's not to like about a little Jimmy?  I think it's Jimmy, though.  Because he's cute.  He's got the little lips that he likes to lick and make him shiny.  What do you like about Jimmy, Brie Olsen?  Everything.  It's out.  Now you've got to talk about it.  Is that true or are they just going into the box?  What makes you think that it's Jimmy for?  Look at Jimmy, right?  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy, Justin.  Look at Jimmy.  Brie, look at Jimmy.  Jimmy, look at Jimmy in the eye.  She's not an adult film star anymore. 
[02:14:00]  She's a little girl.  All right.  If it's not Jimmy, pull both your boobs out.  And then if it is, do that.  I'm going to go pee to the bathroom.  Wow.  Why?  Are you uncomfortable by all this?  I've got to try and tell you shit.  I just really have to go pee.  I drink this whole bottle of Fiji water.  Use the studio.  Use the studio toilet.  Look at Jimmy.  What?  I will when I get back.  We have a bathroom.  I'm right in the studio.  Use the bathroom.  The studio bathroom.  Really?  Yeah.  It's Jimmy.  It's Jimmy. 
[02:14:30]  Well, let's do it then.  Let's do a Brie Olsen pissing video right here.  Jimmy.  Right?  Jimmy just rolling his fucking eyes.  Somebody hold Jimmy.  Strap Jimmy down.  Somebody get the straps.  I have to go pee, though.  Wow.  There she goes.  There she goes.  Going off to the bathroom to pee.  Michael.  All right.  Would you fuck her, Jimmy?  What?  Would you fuck her, Jimmy?  Would I fuck her?  I mean, I know Brie.  I like her.  Would I fuck her?  If my mother died, I would push my father away from the coffin, throw Brie on top of my 
[02:15:00]  mother.  On top of your dead mother.  And fuck her.  And then tell Dad to shut up because he's cock blocking.  Cry later, Dad.  Jesus Christ.  But no, we know each other.  I mean, we know each other from here.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah.  We've never hung out, but we've talked.  Oh, okay.  We always lose touch.  Dude, she couldn't even look at you.  No, she's just being silly.  No, she's not.  We talk, and then we lose touch.  I love how Jimmy downplays stuff. 
[02:15:30]  That's true.  She couldn't even look you in the eye after that knowledge was part of her.  Do you know who it is?  Yeah, I knew.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, really?  All right, let's work you for a while.  Oh, don't work me.  She can come up here.  I've got to take off.  She can come up here.  Really?  I've got to go shoot some promos.  Oh, damn.  That's what I'm saying, but I'm really going to go play guitar on the subway.  I gave it away.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  It's definitely Jimmy.  Is it?  It's over.  Steve.  Steve can back it up.  Publicist.  Right into a cock.  I can back anything up.  Get the publicist in here.  Mark, you're leaving us?  I've got to go.  Now that you're in New York, we'll see you more often, right? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  I'll tell you.  Mark Maron's going to be at comics next month.  I'll meet the cellar this weekend.  Yeah, good.  Okay.  We'll be in touch.  Bye, Mark.  Good luck with that fucking thing.  Mark, nice seeing you.  Anyways, listen, your hips.  My hips?  Your hips are fucking insane.  You really do have nice hips.  Oh, gorgeous hips.  Can I see your hips?  I probably see your hips.  I was a married guy.  Wait, now I can't leave.  No, her hips.  Look at the...  Pull your shirt off the hips.  See how thin her waist is? 
[02:16:30]  Is that a real tattoo or just a...  It's actually in the middle of being removed.  Why are you getting it removed?  It's the logo.  Oh, really?  Oh, it's the trademarked her.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm kind of like...  You have panties on, too?  Yeah.  Those are so red ones.  And they come up over you.  She pulls them up over her hip bones.  Look at those beautiful...  I mean, that's fucking...  Look at that.  That's beautiful.  Look at those gorgeous hip bones.  Thanks.  I had abs like that when I was one.  Oh, mighty.  What happened to me?  Older man. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  We still got to make a video.  Her videos...  Well, I think we can still get the businessman thing done, but she'd have to probably come  out with us because no one's buying our gag.  Really?  No one's buying it.  Really?  Well, now that she has a crush on Jimmy, I don't even know if I could, you know, do  that.  Why?  Jimmy's an open-minded guy.  She's open-minded.  She's going to quit the business because she likes Jimmy a little bit.  They've known each other, too, a little more than anybody else in here.  What do you like about Jimmy?  We could talk.  We already know.  Speak openly. 
[02:17:30]  Speak openly.  What do you like about Jimmy?  Your publicist already said when you were in the bathroom that it's Jimmy, so...  Oh, my God.  She ratted you out in a second.  The second that door shut, she went, it's Jimmy.  I believe it, too.  What?  I knew I shouldn't have left the room, but I had to go so bad.  Yeah.  What do you like about Jimmy?  Still can't look at you, by the way, Jimmy.  Oh, that's so cute.  How cool is this?  Yeah, it's like puppy love.  Puppy love.  Wow.  No, it's probably that everyone is so wrong and she doesn't want to look at my dumb face.  I'm like, yeah, really?  Jimmy, always thinking that it can't be true. 
[02:18:00]  I love it.  Well, no, I just don't make assumptions about people.  You could be balls deep in her, dude.  Like, right now.  What?  You know what?  Okay, I've liked Jimmy since I met him.  And a little story that me and him were just talking about on the way here was that I said,  Jimmy, why haven't you been calling me?  You know, I had given you my number because they wanted, you know, to do something.  And so it's really...  Because he's a dumb fuck?  It's in Jimmy's hands right now.  It's in Jimmy's hands right now. 
[02:18:30]  You know what it is?  It's like we...  Three and I have communicated, but she's like...  The reality is she lives far.  Shut up.  What does she live?  What does she live?  There are planes.  There are airplanes.  Dude, she lives far, dude.  You fly places to fuck her.  I don't think I...  It's like she's working.  Jimmy.  It's not for any bad reasons.  She's working.  Jimmy, leave the show.  Are you insane?  We're at Sunglass Hut.  Now.  Go, Bree, do you want to get some coffee?  What are you waiting for?  That would be a...  This show could survive.  Trust me.  Doing.  Go now. 
[02:19:00]  It's hotels within fucking a stone's throw.  If we ever did hook up or hang out, it would have to be like we just decided we wanted  and we couldn't be like on the show.  What?  It would be silly.  Just leave now with her.  I think about like a sister that I want to fuck.  Oh, no.  It's not like that.  I like Bree a lot.  It's not that, of course, I don't like her.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Bree, can you take your top off for Jimmy?  Top?  Just take the whole dress off and sit there.  Well, that's what I mean by the top.  It's a one piece.  I can't take my whole dress off.  Why?  Why?  Because I'll go like this again. 
[02:19:30]  I'll do this thing again.  She'll be naked.  All right.  This is for you, Jimmy.  And she has a crush on you.  I do.  What if you do that and then pull the bottom up and just keep the middle on?  Mackerel.  Can you just keep the middle on?  Like pull the bottom up a little too?  And just can't have like a middle like your stomach?  You're the worst director ever.  I know.  You suck.  You do a headstand and hopefully your dress will fall around your neck and we can look  at your...  Jesus, Bob.  People want to know if you're blowing off the walls.  Just trying to fucking see some pussy.  No, no, no.  I like Bree.  She knows that. 
[02:20:00]  I don't like blowing her off.  You are.  He's blowing me on.  You're fucking gay.  What's wrong with Bree?  Jimmy Norton's a homosexual.  Not at all.  No, I'm not gay.  Anthony, how quickly would you leave the show right now?  Holy fuck.  That's all I wanted.  Second.  Am I a bad director now, fuckface?  They would have been checking into a hotel by now.  Fuck it.  Hello?  There'd be a bellboy bringing up bags.  And I mean, you know.  I would look over.  There'd be an empty seat.  Hello.  And there'd be your like, your silhouette.  Hello, desk clerk. 
[02:20:30]  Desk clerk.  I need to fuck this girl immediately.  Anthony's hat would still be spinning in the air over his seat.  Hello?  Where's the key?  There'd just be a silhouette through that wall.  Oh, everybody went gross.  That's right.  Just dragging her across 57 by her hair.  Jimmy.  I feel like the roadrunner.  Jimmy, she's now heaving her boobs in the air.  She's trying to get your attention.  Are they really real?  They are real, yeah.  How do you know?  How do you know? 
[02:21:00]  Feel them and tell me if they're real.  Do you want to feel them?  Just feel them and tell me if they're real.  Have you felt my boobs?  No.  I never have, no.  Just feel them a little bit.  Yeah, just feel them, Jimmy.  You've got to feel both, though, because she might have had one done and the other one  not done.  Yeah, that might happen.  I will say that they both have the same...  Consistency?  Genuine quality of realness.  Did he grab them nicely?  Yeah.  She just gave that look down after Jimmy did that.  Dude, Jimmy, do the cheek test.  I don't know what the cheek...  The skin in your cheeks are more sensitive, you can tell.  Yeah, it's true.  I read about that. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, the cheek test.  You have more...  Because your hands are rough because you touch things.  The cock, though, really has more of the nerve endings.  I didn't know...  The cock test is the best.  You do the cock test.  Yeah.  Do you understand right now that there's all these people in the room?  I would be very, very...  My cock right now would be very dysfunctional.  I understand that.  Nobody wants to see it.  I'm just...  I'm saying.  It's a little snail.  Bad job raising children?  Yeah, it's a little snail.  So, dysfunctional now?  Are you disappointed by the reaction of Jimmy?  No, I totally understand. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, no, I like that.  Because he's such a cutie, and I think that we should do our thing outside of...  That's why I said to him, leave.  ...studio, if he ever does call.  But again, we've got a...  If he ever does call.  We've got Kelly.  Oh, you faggot.  No, no, I'm not a faggot.  Oh, you're such a faggot.  We emailed and stuff.  We did talk.  We email.  She's asking you to call her, dunce.  She looks...  My shit.  Hold on.  Yellow treats at AOL.  Keep me in touch.  Let's go to Anthony.  What would you be doing at this moment in time? 
[02:22:30]  Leaving the show.  Leaving the show.  What if the guy didn't get to the front desk fast enough?  Would you alert?  Hello?  Hello?  What the hell?  Desk?  Desk clerk?  I need help.  Meanwhile, the guy is there, but he's on the phone.  Oh, fuck.  I throw it at his head.  Check the belt.  Slap him in the head with it.  Check in.  I thought they would just throw his wallet at him.  We don't have any rooms left with a presidential suite.  I'll take it.  The broom closet.  I only need it for a minute and a half. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, Brie, would you be open to, I don't know, masturbating and making believe it's Jimmy?  And what?  And making believe it's Jimmy?  Maybe she doesn't have a sexual crush on me.  Maybe it's like some...  I don't know.  Why are you trying to cock-block yourself?  You're fucking cock-blocking yourself.  Should I call her?  I think I'll call her.  No, Jimmy.  She's not the smart lady.  Anthony, you're a guy friend to yourself.  That's what I was going to say.  I am just very...  Fucking cock-blocking. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, you're cock-blocking yourself.  Not at all.  Maybe she doesn't like me sexually, really.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying it's a...  You don't ever discount possibilities.  I'm not saying that she doesn't...  I bet the second the mics go off, his fucking pants are around his ankles.  All I'm going to do is...  I just want to jerk off.  Tell me how you shit.  I've got to go to the phones.  I've got to go to the phones.  Okay.  We've got Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Hey, Jimmy.  For the sake of heterosexuality... 
[02:24:00]  Hold on.  We have to get...  Can we get Brie headphones or something?  He's basically saying, for the sake of all men, go fuck Brie.  Do we have...  No, but you've got to realize, too, one of the reasons we can't do that today is...  Why today?  What do you have?  Work?  Listen.  Have you got spots?  What?  Because she is here with other people.  She didn't drive up here by herself.  I understand what Jimmy's doing.  Dude, you can hire a limo to take her anywhere she's got to go after the fucking...  That's right.  I don't think I need to think of it.  I'll sing you to sleep after the fucking...  Get her a limo.  Let's go to Momo.  Momo. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  What's wrong with you?  I'm just thinking of that song you sang.  Would it make your boner go away?  Momo.  Jimmy, listen to me, brother.  Yeah.  You and I have spent many, many...  Too much time sitting in front of a computer screen looking at girls just like this.  What is wrong with you?  I would blow you and your dad to get to this chick.  So please, for the love of God, would you just go on and take this girl out to do...  What are you waiting for?  You're misreading me here. 
[02:25:00]  You think that I don't want to hang out with Bree or that I'm not...  I'm not nervous to hang out with Bree.  I like Bree.  We'll hang out sometime.  It's just we've only hung out here.  That's what you should be hearing right now.  But no, no.  And it's not because for any weird reason.  It's just like all...  It doesn't work when people just go, uh, it's 9.15.  Go fuck!  It doesn't work that way.  Yes, it does.  Do you understand?  Right now, if you were at a hotel room, if you had left immediately and gone to a hotel  room, she would take that, slide it off her shoulders, wham, go down completely naked. 
[02:25:30]  You'd be ready for fucking action in a second.  I'm not saying I wouldn't be.  Bree, would you like to go on a date with Jimmy?  A little dinner maybe?  What's a date to you?  Yeah.  Dinner, for sure.  Yeah, dinner.  Kind of foolish.  Yeah, look at Jimmy.  Yeah, we go eat.  Yeah, we go eat.  We go eat.  We go eat.  Your game is like fucking De Niro's interviewing us.  Those are the two best things, eating and fucking, so go to dinner and fuck.  Right, exactly.  What's worse than after you fuck, you have to go eat and talk?  You want to eat first. 
[02:26:00]  It's almost lunchtime, Jimmy.  What are you waiting for?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's have a tuna, then make out.  Oh.  Tuna fish on rice.  Let's go to Gator Bait.  The unsexiest food.  Gator Bait.  Would you like a macaroni salad, baby?  It's Gator Bait.  What's up, Gator Bait?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You whack your bag all day.  You talk shit in your act about what you do to women.  And now you're fucking sitting around.  Play along, paggit.  Hold on.  It reminds me when that Russian bitch was on with Patrice, and she called him out, and  he sat there and shelled up, too.  No, you're wrong, dude. 
[02:26:30]  I've never once claimed what I do to women.  I never said I fuck bitches' brains out.  I just talk about what a pervert I am.  But I'm not less of a pervert right now, because I can't just leave the show and have sex  with Brie after finding this out.  Brie and I will hang out.  It's not like, oh, I'm sorry, Brie.  We're going to hang out.  It's not even a question.  Play along.  Play along.  I am playing.  What do you play along, sir?  When is Brie going to man?  When do you go back to L.A.?  I go back to Fort Wayne, Indiana on Sunday.  So, yeah.  You guys act like she's leaving on the 2 o'clock this afternoon. 
[02:27:00]  Like, we've got to go back in the JFK Airport bathroom.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, Long Island.  We have a lot of miles on Continental.  Listen to Tom.  Yes, Tom.  Coin, city yourself.  The homo.  Coin, city yourself.  Oh, these guys are dying out there.  Jeremy in Indiana.  The phones are lit.  Jeremy.  Yeah, man.  I'm so disappointed in Jimmy right now.  Wow.  I've been on XM for years.  Listen to the way he talks.  And then he's got this. 
[02:27:30]  Like, you know, I can respect the decision to maybe have a relationship outside of the  program.  But she has asked for that.  And he can't even give that.  Why haven't you called her?  Yeah.  We have traded.  And honestly, the last email exchange we had was quite a while ago.  But called.  Why haven't you called her?  Honestly, God, I'm terrible on the phone.  I honestly.  What's wrong with Brie Olsen, Jimmy?  She's terrific.  I'm honestly brutal on the phone.  I don't call.  But the calling is just to set something up.  You're asking me terrific. 
[02:28:00]  You're just calling and going, hey, Brie, it's Jimmy.  Hey, Brie, you're terrific.  What are you doing?  You know, you want to go out?  You just.  It's to set something up, not to have a conversation about your fucking puppies.  You're asking me, and I'm telling you.  The last.  We traded emails a couple of times.  I think the last email I sent her, and she didn't get back to me.  I didn't take it personally.  Oh, now it's a whole thing where she didn't call, you didn't call, she didn't answer.  Now you're angry with her?  I always leave it in someone's court.  I'm just trying to cock block it.  That's all.  No, but I always leave it in someone's court, and it means that they're busy or whatever.  That's fine.  Are you intimidated by that?  No, not at all.  I like her. 
[02:28:30]  She's very nice.  No.  So why didn't you email my little buddy back?  She might have been busy.  You know, if I would have seen an email from him, I would have responded immediately.  Really?  Yes.  She's saying she never got there.  Immediately.  No, we traded a couple.  She did.  We traded a couple.  Where would you be in this relationship at this point?  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  We don't have any luggage.  I'll buy this hotel.  I feel bad for this girl over here. 
[02:29:00]  I mean, what do you feel bad for her?  We'll get back to her, right?  Who comes in second in the room?  Bobby, we'll get back to her in a second.  We're not letting this go just yet.  No way.  We haven't even seen anything of her.  Let's go to Chris in Philly.  Chris?  Yeah, Jimmy, what's the matter?  Are you afraid you're going to be impotent again?  Again?  Again.  No, who are you?  The guy you couldn't get hard for.  Did you guys hear that?  Did you guys hear that?  Was that a voice in my head?  Well, we've got someone on your side. 
[02:29:30]  Matt from Queensbury.  Hey, guys.  See, what Jimmy's doing here, he's playing the nice guy card.  That way it doesn't come off like such a filthy animal, and now she'll like him even  more.  And then he can have her shit on him.  That doesn't work.  Reverse psychology shit doesn't work.  I have to stick up for him, because he's always been very nice outside of the studio  as well.  And he's really respectful.  There's an issue.  Uh-oh.  Respectful.  Who the fuck do you got standing in for you?  He's not like stalker type.  He's all chill.  You know?  He's like, hey, if you want it, you know, then whatever. 
[02:30:00]  If you don't, you don't.  Why didn't you act like that on Lucky Louie?  He's a good guy.  It was a lot easier to walk in and, like, give the fucking Larry from Three's Company  a look at the audience.  Emotion number 17.  Angry.  No.  Wow.  That's something, Jimmy.  Holy shit.  The hard thing is when you don't live near each other.  Seriously.  And I don't travel to Indiana.  She's not looking to get married.  I'm not saying that, but just even to hang out, it's hard.  So what are you doing? 
[02:30:30]  Hanging out in Indiana.  What are you doing?  Flying to fucking Indiana.  I'm on a flight to Indiana.  Fuck yeah.  I'm buying a condo in Indiana.  Holy shit.  I'm buying a farm in Indiana next to your house.  Are you out of your mind?  Here's what I'd be hearing.  Flight 223 to Indiana.  I'm now leaving from gate 26.  Gate 26.  Can I get on the plane now?  That's not boarding yet.  You haven't even landed.  Can I wait in the jetway?  Can I just wait in the jetway? 
[02:31:00]  Does this plane go any faster?  Hey, we got some...  Come on, gentlemen.  We're experiencing a little delay.  We have a...  No, fuck no!  Fuck no!  You see Anthony running next to a train like Superman 1?  I'll fix it.  It's broken.  I'll pay for the engine.  Let's go to Footer.  Footer's supporting you, Jimmy.  Footer?  Just...  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, you know what?  You got to give Jimmy a break.  You got to settle down a little bit.  It's just very clear that Jimmy is a fucking faggot.  Jimmy!  Sir, you're missing the point. 
[02:31:30]  I work here.  It's hard for us.  She works, and I work.  It's like, I'm here five days a week, and then every weekend I'm working.  Oh, God.  The fuck is this lame excuse?  Yes, you can.  Are you Oprah?  It's true.  You can.  Brie needs to hear something, so I got...  Do you know that I like her?  When we talk about Brie Olsen and how hot you are, Jimmy jumps right.  God damn it, she's so fucking hot.  I say nice of her.  How long's the flight from here to Indiana?  Two hours.  How long?  Okay.  Two hours.  The show ends. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Right, Jimmy?  At any point in your life, the show ends.  It's 11.30.  You'll get a flight for 12.30.  I can't even have a flight.  You leave from LaGuardia.  You fucking...  You go to Indiana.  You fuck...  You could be back in time for spots at the cellar.  Yeah, it doesn't work that way.  This is what we want.  Monday?  Travel to and from the airport.  Yeah, I don't know.  But she is the type of girl, though.  I mean, you look at her.  Tell her what she is.  Tell us what she is. 
[02:32:30]  You could fucking really fall for a fucking porn chick like this.  I mean, she's cute.  She's sweet.  Yeah, she's got a gorgeous pussy.  Her nipples are fucking awesome.  She likes to fuck around.  Her asshole is cool.  I mean, there's a lot of sweet things about her.  They're a hopeless romantic.  These are a few of my favorite things.  Assholes and nipples and pussy and smiles.  We expect a phone call Monday that you're not going to be into work because you got stuck in Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
[02:33:00]  You're going to get a fucking, one day you're going to get a letter from me like the guy said in Apocalypse Now.  Yeah, sell the kids, sell the house.  Sell the station, fuck my apartment.  In Indiana.  Wow.  I think we're going to get to the problem here.  Jack in Chicago.  Jack.  Hey, guys.  You've got to be easy on Jimmy.  He needs to do a signature move.  Put the boombox on your shoulder and walk by playing a select song.  That's right.  Iron Man.  Damn it.  Yeah.  If Jimmy walked past you with this on a boombox, would you think he was cool? 
[02:33:30]  No, not so much.  Oh, right.  Not so much.  All right, we'll do that.  That's great.  Are you into Black Sabbath or Ozzy?  No.  Why should she be fucked those?  Those fucking old metal shit dicks.  Ozzy can fucking eat crushed glass for all I can.  Fuck Sabbath.  No, I mean, they're okay.  What kind of music do you like?  I listen to it to everything.  Like what?  What's your favorite?  I listen to a lot of R&B and hip hop. 
[02:34:00]  Jimmy was saying this the other day.  That's right.  Yeah, I saw 50 last night.  Yeah, right.  And country.  Jimmy loves country.  Johnny Cash.  Well, that's a little old.  Little Willie Nelson.  That's a little old girl.  Why don't you stop talking so much?  Why?  Because you're going to ruin it.  I like the country.  We're different musically.  We'll turn each other on a different music.  That's good.  We've got another supporter for Jimmy.  Red in Rhode Island.  Red?  Rhode Island Red?  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, yo. 
[02:34:30]  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Alcoholics.  Yeah, I just want to tell Jimmy, it's all right.  I don't much like girls either.  See?  He don't like girls either.  That's pretty funny.  I understand everyone is painting me as basically a dick something.  You should be painting her.  What are you doing?  This is the point.  I'm not uncomfortable with Brie.  I'm not worried about hanging with her.  I'm not saying you're not uncomfortable.  It's not that I don't like her.  I do like her.  She does not like her.  He's saying that it's more than just deviance.  There might be a little friendship there, and he might want it to go maybe have a show 
[02:35:00]  of a little respect and may go a little further than, you know, just, hey, you suck this  and I lick that and I'll fuck you.  You know what I mean?  He wants to maybe go to Starbucks, get a cafe Americano.  No.  And then go to a play and then suck a cock in an alley.  Well, no.  That's right, Bob.  No, that's not it.  It's just, she lives far from me and we both work.  Right now, at this point, I'd be on the hotel phone.  Could you send up housekeeping?  I spilled struddle icing all over my sheets.  Thank you. 
[02:35:30]  How do you get blood out of paint?  Out of paint.  Out of ceiling tiles.  Let's go to Rich.  Rich?  I need to pay for the carpet.  Rich.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I know why Jimmy doesn't want to bang her.  She doesn't have a cock between her legs.  That's right.  Oh, first of all.  She doesn't have a dick.  He's saying that I prefer a transsexual, which is just a pack of lies.  These colors are brutal.  Yeah, they are.  We say they're very fresh.  Jimmy, what do you say about trannies in general?  Yuck. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, who needs them more than a few dozen times?  We got Steve in Philly.  Steve?  What's up, boys?  I don't blame you.  Do I hate that Missy penis, too?  Yeah.  That's right.  Steve joke number 1575.  Steve, go ahead, Steve.  Hey, I just want to ask Bree a question.  Bree, do you see that charming man named Anthony sitting across from you?  He's a millionaire.  He lives in a mansion, and he drives really nice cars.  Anthony, what are you waiting for?  If Jimmy doesn't want it, you hit that shit.  No, but she doesn't have the crush thing, and she's with Jimmy.  And the last thing I would ever do is try to cock block Jimmy. 
[02:36:30]  I have a pool also with a jacuzzi.  Yes.  And if your drink's ever warm and you want to cool it off, you're dropping it in a jacuzzi.  If you're out of ice cubes.  Anthony's trying to get girls for his mansion because he's doing a webcam show.  I'm going to do a whole webcam show from my house and just have me and maybe six, seven girls just running around the house being, like, fucking whore-ish or, you know, drunk.  Whatever.  Whatever.  And just, you know, have that go on at the house. 
[02:37:00]  I think it'll be fun.  It's happening anyway.  I might as well put it on video.  There's no attraction there whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  I think she's actually been, she's been giving me a little Google eyes.  Shut up.  That's what I got.  Yeah.  Look, you think.  She's got her arms folded.  She's bored.  She just said what?  Are you bored?  Yes.  Now listen, she said what?  I was reading the caller comments.  Oh, really?  She's looking past me in the phone screen.  Sorry, Anthony.  Holy shit.  I thought she was looking at you.  Holy fuck. 
[02:37:30]  I thought she was staring at you.  I am a fucking, just an abysmal bum here tonight.  It was an optical illusion.  Where'd it go, boy?  Oh, she was staring at the side of his head for a half hour.  I thought I picked up on something there.  What are you going to do?  Hey, baby.  You're going to go back to your house.  Bombed.  That's okay.  That's funny.  I'm going to become a Jehovah's Witness.  I seem to have some luck.  We still got to make our Brie Olsen video because these things take off online.  Oh, God bless you.  What are you going to do today, Brie? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, my goodness.  I don't know.  I have an egg white omelet.  Well, you did the motorboat thing last time.  That was really good.  You just, like, worked a crowd with motorboats.  What's that?  Oh, yeah.  It's when you take your dead wife out and dump her over the edge.  And then you fucking leave with Brie.  Yeah, that's how it works.  Jesus.  The motorboat.  Yeah, you do the motorboat.  One stupid hair.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:38:30]  Clean up after yourself, dummy.  Get one of those things you clean the computer fucking keys out with.  Check the boat, stupid.  He's for you.  Something is not going on here with these two.  No, it'll happen.  It'll happen.  Jimmy's too fucking...  It's fun.  Everybody's misreading it.  Like, no, I'm not very comfortable with it.  I would love to have a fucking, like, EKG hooked up to you right now, though, because you're  playing so...  But I'm really...  It'll happen.  And it would be like...  It would be like a hubbing bird's heartbeat.  No, I've been up since yesterday, so I am really sleepy, so I'm kind of lethargic. 
[02:39:00]  But that's...  It's just...  I'm being realistic.  We just haven't seen each other.  Are you getting a little, like...  It's not like she lives here.  I'm like, yeah, get away from me.  I want to see her.  Are you getting, like, a little...  When you think about it, do you get a little, like, whoosh, down below?  That's a fart?  No, no.  It's like a little adrenaline rush when you go, I think we're going to be fucking soon.  You get a little adrenaline rush, or are you beyond that because you're so desensitized  from just fucking everything that moves?  It's not that I fuck everything that moves.  That was a cock-locking statement.  I'm sorry.  No, it wasn't.  I'm sorry.  I was trying.  Brian, would you have sex with Jimmy within the next hour, if you could? 
[02:39:30]  Not saying here.  I'm just saying in general.  I suppose it just depends on the situation.  Did you ever fantasize about having sex with Jimmy?  Yes.  Have you fantasized about...  Wow, that was a definitive yes, wasn't it?  So have I.  Have you kissed him?  I was hoping for at least a pause.  Did you fantasize about kissing him, like...  I don't...  I'm not going to get into all that.  Oh, she did.  Is it more a pounding fucking, or is it some romance and stuff? 
[02:40:00]  You know, I don't know, because it's kind of like a cute crush, too.  So, you know, there's kind of the...  You want him dressed like a baby with a bonnet?  Have you masturbated?  That could happen.  It could happen.  Have you masturbated thinking about Jimmy?  Mama feed me.  Mama feed me.  What is he?  Gerber's pussy.  We already went through that.  Wait, did she answer that question?  Yeah.  Did you masturbate thinking of Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just asked.  Oh, yeah, he did just ask her.  I thought there was something...  Oh, never mind.  Wow.  I heard something else.  I'm sorry.  Do you...  Lucky little boy.  When was the last time you masturbated?  When was the last time that happened to Jimmy? 
[02:40:30]  Jimmy was voted luckiest boy on September 11th, 2008.  I bet he was.  The last time I was here in the studio.  Really?  Yeah, that night.  In my hotel.  Oh, my gosh.  I like to hear Ted, the porn star fucker.  I like to fuck porn.  Get out of the way.  You're getting a cum bath.  I don't have that much cum.  Would you say Popeye's?  One of Jim's many funny characters on the program, by the way. 
[02:41:00]  Ted.  Yeah.  My life sucks.  I could just leave now.  I fucking hate my life.  I fucking...  Just a fucking zilch.  I'm like a fucking A-Rod in a clutch situation.  Strike!  Slap a ball out of a glove.  Why?  We'll hang out.  We'll eat.  And, you know, if we...  I'm not saying we'll never have sex, but we can eat first.  I'm just saying.  Of course I wouldn't have sex there.  Of course not.  Why would you...  I'm not an idiot.  Hey, uh...  What?  That's a little over the top, Jimmy. 
[02:41:30]  What did Uncle Paul think of Bree's story about losing her virginity when she was 12?  That Jehovah's Witness sure was late.  Oh, that's outrageous, Uncle Paul.  Jesus, why don't you wait until she's getting Social Security?  Wow.  People are doing...  People are doing research for you.  Jimmy, there is a Crackers in Indiana, 45 minutes away from Fort Wayne, so...  Got a comedy club right there.  It could be work and a pleasure. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, that will really cement the deal.  She sees me bombing in front of 30 people at some shit club in Boston, Cleveland, or New York.  I'm three-marking Jimmy.  All right, we've got to take a break.  What's the big plug for the girls in case they run out of here?  Jim's dick.  We are signing at Exotica in New Jersey, the convention center and expo in Edison, and that  is Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and there's going to be a lot of hot chicks there.  You can see me and Caden at Fantasy Island through Genesis, so it's going to be good times. 
[02:42:30]  There's a lot of girls there, too.  There's Sonny Lane and Gina Lynn.  Yeah, Gina Lynn, Sorby Daniels.  At the very least, go there and comfort Brie Olsen from this rejection.  Yeah, from being rejected by Jimmy.  You're right.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  I've never seen an adult film star as beautiful as this get shot down.  I'm not shooting her down.  What?  I'm not shooting her down.  You're not fucking her.  You're shooting her down.  No.  There's a happy medium there somewhere.  Yeah, exactly.  Where would you be right now?  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, my God.  Hello, parking.  Could you bring my truck up?  I'm done.  I fucked three times in 45 seconds.  I think it's funny that you went on the plane immediately, too.  Yes, I went on that plane.  Like, two, two, three, two.  All right, why don't we take a quick break and continue.  You guys are hanging out for a little bit, right?  Okay.  Oh, there it is.  Thank you.  There it is.  What?  No, Jimmy.  There it is.  No, no.  I just saw exactly what happened. 
[02:43:30]  But the publicist said they got to go, Jimmy.  Look, she's saying there's another, right?  Yeah.  That was, you guys are hanging out.  You're not leaving because after the show, that's when the action starts.  Oh, you are in for, oh, what a night you're going to have.  Jimmy, it's disappointing.  It's too bad they have to leave.  Wow, you're better on Comedy Central than you are here.  Oh, I'm sorry, Pri.  It's just late.  I'm not used to these hours.  They have to leave, though, Jimmy.  What? 
[02:44:00]  What?  Who said it?  See, they got to leave, yeah.  They have to leave?  Who said what?  See, Jimmy, they got to leave.  No, she's too nice.  She's acting.  You don't care anyway, so it's fine.  She's acting.  I don't see her nodding because she's being blocked by this.  I want to see her naked so bad.  Did that just come out?  Wow.  You said that, dummy.  I did.  Yeah.  Shit.  Can you get naked for Bobby after the break?  I'll get naked after the break.  For Bobby.  All right.  Wow.  Spit take.  I've never heard that.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock. 
[02:44:30]  Sam, coming up after the break, Brie, Earl, how does this make sense at all?  It doesn't make sense, but Brie Olsen is willing to sometimes do some charity work, and that's  what this would be described as.  Brie Olsen gets a little closer with Black Earl.  When we get back, it's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  And Anthony, the virus, you're listening to the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:45:00]  Sam, we're into part two of Brie Olsen and Caden Cross.  Now, after getting to meet Earl, Brie starts to get a little involved with Earl.  Yes.  After getting to meet Earl, now Brie is meeting Earl's meat.  I get that.  That was really funny.  Yeah.  She doesn't really know what kind of a moron Earl really is, and Earl's never felt the touch  of a woman before.  Yes, and he doesn't like it.  He prefers the scabby, hard hands of a man.  But for the radio, Earl will do it.  We thank Brie Olsen, who really made this possible.  She's fantastic. 
[02:45:30]  Here it is.  Brie Olsen and Black Earl on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let the show die, then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  Yeah, this song is for Brie Olsen today, as she continues to think about Jim Norton.  I want to set the stage here, Anthony, with such wusses on this 9-11 anniversary that we  changed all the TVs in studio to kids programming. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, we got Dora the Explorer and Barney is on the TVs.  We're not a fan of seeing the footage from 9-11.  No.  And, you know, some people think it should be on TV.  Others think it should not.  Whatever.  We just don't want to see it.  So we got the kids' channels on, and we got Brie Olsen, and I forgot your name.  Caden.  Thank you, Caden.  I'm sorry, Caden.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  In studio, and they're going to be part of the Exotica thing that's happening in...  Mike's not working? 
[02:46:30]  What?  Mine is.  Her Mike's not working.  Which one?  Oh, no.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  All right.  All we have to do now is make a video.  And, oh, Bobby, look how excited Bobby.  Bobby's humping the disc.  He's humping the disc.  I forgot, Bobby.  I'm the worst friend ever.  I've been married for a year.  No one has touched my dick.  I'm the worst friend ever.  Can I touch your dick?  What?  Oh, fucking.  Let me tell you something about that hot palpitation thing you were talking about when she just said  that. 
[02:47:00]  If you put that shit on my heart, it would have fucking shot across the room.  I think I just came.  I think there's pre-sem on the tip of my honk.  Pre-sem.  Yeah.  Bobby's looking good, too.  He lost a lot of weight, right, Bobby?  Yeah, 55 pounds, and it went all through my dick.  I got an inch back of my cock.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, now it's three and a half inches.  So, Bobby, what did we promise you I forgot?  Fucking head from both of them?  No.  I forgot what we promised you before the break.  I don't know.  Fuck it.  I'm just happy to be here.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:47:30]  She was going to get naked for you.  This show, she's going to get naked.  I fucking love XM.  XM, XM, XM.  I love the show, ladies.  I'm just a little excited.  I've been married, you know what I mean?  It's a little fucking lame.  How long have you been married for?  For a year.  Having some sex problems, you know.  Bobby, what?  Trying to work through it.  I got to, you know, kind of when I go down to my wife, I have to go, it's not my sister.  It's not my sister.  I have to do just the opposite.  That is a high-lighted, Jim.  It was a slow roll.  This is my sister. 
[02:48:00]  That's a good line.  It is my sister.  That was a big line.  So, yeah, a year.  Where are we at?  How are we going to do this, Bobby?  I don't know.  How do you want to do this?  I usually just take the shirt off and the pants down.  Really?  That's how you guys get naked.  She's very mechanical.  She's shy.  She's like a ball muster.  I like it.  She knows how to throw the ball around with the guys.  No pun intended.  Right up the balls with the guys.  All right.  So, she's going to...  For Bobby.  Bobby, you need to be... 
[02:48:30]  Would you show your penis?  Can you show your mouth?  No, I can't take my cock off.  If I take my cock off...  Dude, Jim, I'm going to lose my mind.  Please, just move on.  How about she just slaps her head?  Wow.  Slap?  No.  He meant that so seriously.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to lose my mind.  Just move on.  No, I'm not fucking...  No, listen.  I want to fucking...  You understand, dude.  I'm fucking that close.  If she bent over right now and said, come here, you faggot.  Eat my asshole.  I would be over there like...  You'd be clunking heads with five other people.  Fucking...  What do you say?  The word faggot...  The word faggot...  The word faggot tricked everybody. 
[02:49:00]  Bobby, as a married man, what are you allowed to do?  What am I allowed to do?  Leave now?  I'll never come back to this show ever again?  Go on fucking Bill and Joe, whoever the fuck they are in the Midwest.  How close are you to ruining your marriage?  No, I'm not fucking...  I'm not going to ruin...  I love my wife.  I'm not going to fucking ruin my marriage for either one of these brunts.  Why?  What's wrong with them?  I was just saying that in case she's listening.  Then she'd be like, oh, and then shut it off.  Now I'll fuck you.  All right.  How about this?  In a fantasy world, how close are you to... 
[02:49:30]  Fantasy world?  ...throwing your marriage out the window?  Dude, I've already fucking...  We're in fantasy world now.  We're in fantasy world.  You know, you just said you could kiss my bottom in fantasy world.  What do you mean kiss the bottom?  You're rubbing your fucking dick.  I can't help it.  You're just standing up.  That's not my dick.  You're being subtle about it.  That's not my dick.  I'm doing laundry after the show.  I got quarters.  Oh my God.  All right, dimes.  Ah, you cunt.  Bob, you want to sit in the comfy chair for the...  No, don't make me.  We have all the comfy chairs.  This is the weird part about me, honest to God, that I have such a creep level. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  Jim will probably relate to me on this.  That, you know, like I go from like strip clubs and shit like that.  Spit it out, De Niro.  What happens?  He's doing a little...  It was really weird and perfectly normal.  It was fast and slow.  Vagina.  Al's short.  I get fucking really bad, dude.  Like I got a fucking sex problem.  I got...  I mean like in ice...  Maybe I can relate to you on that. 
[02:50:30]  So let's test...  I didn't want to throw...  Bobby, can we at least test out your sex problem?  Like maybe she bends over after she's naked.  God.  All right, let's see what takes to fill me up.  All right.  Like fill me up halfway.  Get a little blood in the old fucking helmet.  I agree that...  I agree to that way too quickly.  I'm like, all right.  Yeah, come on.  Let's see Bobby's fucking shit to make you fill up with blood.  All right.  She's going to get naked.  So we're going to test out your sex.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  She's beautiful.  All right.  She's very lovely.  Jaden is removing her shirt.  Do you need...  Oh my fucking Lord. 
[02:51:00]  Bobby, move your fucking head.  Oh, sorry.  She's big, beautiful nipples.  Where am I?  Well...  Sorry, guys.  Wherever you are, move.  Her nipples are nice.  No, stand up, Bobby.  I can't.  The fucking hell talk fucking morons want to see.  Wait.  Can he stand up?  Where does he...  We need him standing up.  Let me go to Camp 5.  All right.  Hold on.  Bobby, what is that doing for you?  She's now topless.  What is that doing for me?  It's fucking...  First of all, she's got unbelievable boobs.  I love her little nipples.  Boobs.  Sorry for fucking not speaking correctly.  God bless you. 
[02:51:30]  What do you put, a little sheen on your tit?  No, it's just fucking cold in here.  Perfect.  They're beautiful.  You're beautiful.  And her hips are amazing.  Amazing.  All right.  Take the bottom off.  Okay.  All right.  What does this do for you, Bobby?  Well, she's got to do it...  More than what it's doing for everybody else.  There you go.  There you go.  Want a little dance or something?  Well, I don't know.  Just maybe you can pretend.  Just like you're, you know, going to bed.  Now she's down to a tiny little red G-string there, Bobby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  Boy, it doesn't leave much to the imagination, he said.  Oh. 
[02:52:00]  Wow.  What is that doing for you, Bobby?  I love the underwear.  Should we go further?  Oh, thank you.  She's very beautiful.  She's a very beautiful girl.  Should we go further?  No.  Let's stop there and call it a day.  Can we see your hiney?  Not to be...  Wow.  Wow.  Can you touch your toes for Bobby?  Wow, that's a fuck.  Touch your toes?  Yeah.  For Bobby.  Well, that's actually for her.  That's for Brie Olsen.  Bobby's over here with the fucking half heart on her.  Bobby, what is that doing for you?  What does that do for me?  It's... 
[02:52:30]  It's...  She's beautiful.  I mean...  She's fucking...  I'm sorry for just getting lost in vagina.  I really did.  I was just talking to her pussy like it was her face.  What are you doing?  Want to get some Starbucks?  No, not you.  Your pussy.  Bob's having a creep moment.  He's losing a little bit.  She's beautiful.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, there's like a breath.  Yeah.  Bobby's losing a little bit.  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is...  I'm just blaming you.  Trust me.  Yeah, she's unbelievable.  But she's a little shy.  She gets shy.  You can see how you're not...  Like, Brie...  I like Brie because you're kind of like... 
[02:53:00]  You kind of like it.  You kind of...  You make me feel comfortable.  Like, when you showed your...  You know, hey, check it out.  It's my pussy.  It's nice.  So you make it me...  You're kind of...  I like it, too.  It's a different vibe.  But you're kind of like...  Shut up.  I'm ready.  Thank you.  Shit.  Shut up.  I'm just fucking waiting for one of you to fucking...  Wow.  Chime in.  Thank you.  You are babbling.  On your lap.  All right.  That would make me feel better if Brie got up and sat on your lap.  All right.  I think that's only fair.  Would you object to that?  Okay.  You got to sit on Jimmy.  You object to it. 
[02:53:30]  Just sit on...  How the fuck is this?  It'll make Bob more comfortable because he...  It's more comfortable.  I keep your hands on top, too, so you can hear everything.  I want you to do.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, if you could just sit on your...  I mean, if you have to pull your skirt up to make it more comfortable...  No, she's just cool.  All right.  So Jimmy now has Brie on his...  Nicely, yeah.  Yeah, very nicely.  That should calm me down a little bit, Bobby.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What is that?  I mean, are you okay?  Do you have an itch?  Oh, she has an itch.  I'm just humping.  She's doing a Michael J. Fox impression on Jimmy's lap.  What was that other movie you were just doing, that little hip thing?  How do you do that with your hips?  Wow, that's crazy.  Yeah, that.  What is that called? 
[02:54:00]  I don't know.  Let's make up a name for it.  Keep going.  It's called Give Jimmy a Boner.  Keep doing it.  I like it.  You do it.  Have Caden do it to you.  We can have like a circle fest.  That's what it can be called, the circle fest.  A circle fest?  A circle fest?  I don't know.  I love shit.  You can add fest to anything in porn.  Dick fest.  Pussy fest.  Circle fest.  Cum fest.  How about a fucking get back to business fest?  Yeah, right?  Well, that's right.  Yeah.  You have this beautiful girl. 
[02:54:30]  I know.  Bobby, what else do you need?  Well, I feel bad.  I mean, I don't know.  Just ask.  You can always say no.  Maybe you are.  You want to come sit on my lap a little bit?  Come sit on your lap a little bit.  Really?  A little bit.  Let me tell you.  Wait a minute.  I don't want to fucking crack my iPhone.  Fuck it.  No, you just don't want her to think your dick is bigger and thicker than it is.  I thought that one is good.  I thought it was good.  I'm laughing.  I'm not.  I'm appreciative.  I'm completely focused here.  Number five.  Hi, how are you?  All right, good.  There you go.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.  She's rubbing her hiney all over her. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, she is.  Wow, I love this little, her back.  You could fucking rest a root beer can right there.  Bob likes weird things.  It's not the nipples.  It's like the hips and the back.  I do.  I like weird parts of the body.  That's good.  No, no.  Actually, parts of the body like that are really cool.  I like that.  Like hips, back, shoulders.  I like this right here.  Legs, pussy, tits, mouth, assholes.  Mouths.  Mouths.  All right.  But see, this is how creepy I am.  That this right here, this is, I mean, it's, all right, there you go. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, okay.  She's doing that thing.  She's doing that thing.  Hang on, just shush, relax.  I was focusing for a second.  Oh, okay.  See, like this, I mean, it does, makes me feel gooey inside.  You are gooey inside.  Easy.  Well.  But it's, you smell fucking fantastic.  You smell fucking, that's just it, you smell.  What is it?  Lotion?  Fantastic.  Yeah.  But, yeah, it's working a little, I mean, just a little. 
[02:56:00]  But I'm such a creep.  Looks like she's riding a hippity hop.  You read that.  No, I didn't.  Are you a motherfucker?  I'm very proud of my hippity hop jokes.  That was a real good one, you cunt.  Just grab my bottom lip and pull.  How come Bree stopped?  No, no, she's fine.  Do you ever play Patty Cake?  Because Jimmy came already.  No, no, no, she doesn't have to bounce.  She could just sit.  Oh, she's bouncing.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You know what that's going to be like, what that would be like?  Yeah.  What?  I imagine somewhere between. 
[02:56:30]  I'm just saying.  Good and gooder.  At this point, would you still be doing radio?  Guys?  Guys?  No.  Guys?  Guys?  Oh, what's up?  Guys?  Oh, you motherfuckers.  I have to take my wine out of my pillow.  Two chatty Cathy's.  Focus.  Damn it.  Okay.  I just missed giving the audience.  Did you ever play London Bridge is Going Up?  Jimmy, how is it over there?  It's really nice. 
[02:57:00]  I mean, just sitting here.  There's a lot of stuttering going on today.  It's good.  It's so weird to touch a woman who is this solid.  Like, her skin is so fucking taut.  God bless your back.  You don't touch skin like that in your real life, Bobby?  Yeah, I do.  I mean, my wife's, you know, my wife's, oh my God.  Hang on.  Just fuck my, stop talking.  Let's just, what is that move?  What is that?  How do you make your asshole do that?  Wow.  Oh, I just got a cramp in my fucking hamstring. 
[02:57:30]  I swear to God.  What nationality are you?  Viking?  Viking.  Are you Swedish?  Yeah, you see?  Yeah, you can tell.  Is that your real, like you're really blonde?  I am naturally blonde, but I go lighter with color.  Really?  All right.  Go back to that.  Bob, way to ask her.  Oh, excuse me.  The rug matches the drapes.  Sorry.  Smooth.  You want to go to dinner and a movie.  Yeah.  What were you doing before?  I forget what you were doing. 
[02:58:00]  What was that thing?  What?  That little thing.  She was doing the circular hip move.  Bree is sitting here.  And it's perfect.  Now, that one.  Now, she was doing that one.  I like that one.  It's kind of like you're at a nightclub having fun, kind of.  Yeah.  Bree's just sitting here.  And it's nice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Of course.  It's nice.  It's like we're, like, two men at a strip club.  Yeah, only it's work.  Only you're at work.  It's like we're at work.  I have no underwear on either, which makes this... 
[02:58:30]  Messier?  Yeah, I'm just going to be...  Harder to clean up?  My dick's going to be stuck to my thigh the whole way back.  You're going to take a piss.  It's going to look like a lawn sprinkler?  I hate that shit.  Ah, fuck.  Going out to the left.  What else do you need?  Wait for the fucking stamp glue to come off of the tip of your dick.  Bobby, what else do you need today?  What else do I need?  I don't know.  I mean, I like when girls do things to girls.  Yeah, I like that a lot.  I like that.  I don't...  And you girls are...  Oh, God. 
[02:59:00]  I don't know why this doesn't get me fully aroused.  Because you're a homo?  No, it's never has.  I'm kidding, Bob.  I mean, believe me, I'm trying to pretend like she has a penis flapping on my knee.  Here's what it is.  It's because in a room full of...  Because it's fun hanging out, but it's not deviant because we're all being cool.  You know you can't do anything, so there's not a deviance to it.  I'm a deviant, you're a deviant.  Yeah.  These amazing girls, you know it can't be too deviant at the moment because we're on  the radio.  Right.  So it's harder to be... 
[02:59:30]  Oh, she just touched my knee.  That did something.  I'd love to see some of these guys.  That little...  Dude, this...  Okay, wait a second.  Now she's fucking going into fourth gear.  We're like two old women knitting.  You know what it is, too, is that...  Okay.  What?  Hang on one second.  What's going on with that?  She just did some ancient Chinese fucking tenchu trick.  She just broke out some fucking karate on my cock.  Broke out some karate on...  Holy shit, motherfucker.  Holy...  Well, it...  That little...  See, that shit. 
[03:00:00]  See, I think I'm a romantic.  I think I like the little soft.  I don't like the bouncy, hey, I'm going to bounce on you.  I like this little...  Bobby, let's ask if she's feeling...  Are you feeling anything?  I feel zipper.  You feel zipper?  That's it.  Oh, that's good.  That's actually it.  No, that's it.  That's good, Bobby.  I don't have zipper...  These are buck flies.  That's good.  These are chick jeans.  I pull them on.  Yeah, I...  It's so weird that this...  I mean, she got...  That was a little...  Hang on while I swallow my fucking spit.  That was a little arousing. 
[03:00:30]  But, yeah, there's something about this.  Like, I think I'm just such a creep that it's...  Like, if I wasn't married right now,  I would fucking...  I'd probably go ballistic.  I would fucking do whatever they'd let me do.  No one's...  No one's talking.  It's just watching.  Um, I have...  What is...  Jimmy is flexing his cock.  Can I see this?  Oh, is he twitching it? 
[03:01:00]  Jimmy, you twitching your...  It's not...  Yeah, it's not fully hard,  but it's involuntary.  The twitch is a great move.  Oh, my God.  I love the twitch.  I am so fucking horny right now.  It's an involuntary.  Jim, fuck up.  It's an involuntary twitch.  Really?  Involuntary twitch.  Wait, get a mic on her,  because she's really, like,  grinding on Jimmy now.  It's an involuntary...  It just happens.  Hey, what's going on over there?  Oh.  Nothing.  Uh, Brie.  Oh, my God.  Tell us what's going on, Brie.  Look at that little fuck.  It's just amazingness. 
[03:01:30]  You get, like, a fucking solid cucka.  Oh, fuck.  Wait, Brie's getting...  Hold on, Bobby.  What is that?  Something's going on over here.  What?  I don't even know what's happening.  What's up, Brie?  Nothing is going on.  I want to just see something.  I'm just living in the moment of my glory right now.  Yeah, get up one second.  Just one second.  Let me just...  See, I don't know why that fucking...  Why doesn't that fucking do anything?  You don't have to worry about it, Bob.  It does do something.  You turn it on.  Yeah, just a little bit.  Yeah, but it doesn't fill up.  It's still mushy.  Because there's a room full of people.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  And it's almost like you're saying...  You're pointing at your dick.  Yeah, sit down.  I was trying to help you, but you just keep trying.  Yeah, sit right there.  That might be better.  What happened?  Nothing.  We're just hanging out.  If someone asks you directions, would you ever go, it's that way?  Bob, just for those of you at home...  All right, just let it lie.  All right, just to explain to people what was happening, and Anthony is manipulating the  pal to our cameras?  Well, I just want, you know, people at home to be able to enjoy. 
[03:02:30]  Well, you know, this is basically like going to a strip club right now, but a really nice  strip club because the girls are actually cool and hot.  Yeah, you know, you can't only go so far.  How about handing me 200 bucks so it really feels like you're in a strip club?  Leave a little more broke, and that coffee you're drinking will cost you $20, and she'll  have three.  And some big guy will say, hey, get your hands off her.  Yeah, exactly.  Can't touch the ladies.  Just like a strip club. 
[03:03:00]  Why don't you bring somebody famous in, too, just to take all the girls away from me?  How old are you?  I'm surprised Mr. Post's not here to kick someone.  Really?  You have a boyfriend?  Hi.  Oh.  What?  We tend to have a boyfriend in this industry.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I ain't going to fight that argument.  A lot of guys are threatened, right?  I'm not saying I wouldn't be.  I'm not threatened.  It's just, it's difficult.  I work constantly, and there's no point.  How about you give her the mic a little there, fucking Bobby, while she's talking and you're  shutting up?  I'm sorry.  You are the worst. 
[03:03:30]  I'm sorry, dude.  I'm just, I'm sorry.  Dude, fuck, I'm not the worst.  I'm just a little distracted.  All right.  Yeah, I should cut you a little slack.  A little bit, dude.  All right.  She's fucking rolling.  Oh, hang on.  Just, yeah, keep asking her questions, though.  Go ahead.  Um, what was I saying?  I don't care.  Yeah, there's no point in having a boyfriend, really.  So, wait a minute, you put you working, you working a lot and traveling a lot at the top  of what a guy might find difficult to be with you?  Um.  Not the fact that you're sucking a cock? 
[03:04:00]  No, because, um, I have dated, and they don't usually have a problem with it.  They don't care?  Mm-hmm.  That's cool.  I mean, I would need that.  I would need that.  You get everything you need from a boyfriend at work.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, so why bother?  Do you like women?  Um, they're fun.  But?  But they're not fun, if that's all you get.  You like to go camping, and a guy cooks up some stuff.  No, she's talking, she needs cock at the end of it.  She needs some cack at the end of it.  How'd you tie camping into that?  I don't know, you're right.  Fulfilling my fantasy.  I was going to go to bed.  We're camping. 
[03:04:30]  We're camping, and he tries to pitch a tent, and he can't.  Hey, Bobby, Steven S has got something for you.  Go ahead.  Uh, to get a full erection, Bobby needs one of you guys to yell at him as if you're his  stepfather.  Jeez.  Fucking asshole's not far off.  Goddamn Billy Manchington.  All right, we're not bad, huh?  We gotta, like, kind of wind down, unless we got something else up.  Wind down?  Well, I'm saying.  Well, kid, do we want to do some kind of a video, like, something fun?  Can we do the girls? 
[03:05:00]  Something fun?  Yeah.  Will you guys do a little something?  I'll do a little something.  I don't know.  Let's let them do a little something.  I don't know if they're into it, to be honest with you.  Oh, she's into it.  I'll do it.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's all peppy.  It doesn't have to be crazy.  It can be something that ties in with the listeners.  Okay.  Yeah.  Or ties on one of the chicks.  Brie, why don't you demonstrate on me what you'd want to do to him?  Oh, shit.  No, you didn't.  I have to object, because my only thing is this.  What if she puts a strap on and gets you in the bag and says, call more often, faggot? 
[03:05:30]  It would be accurate?  That'd be a good idea.  Are you into that, Brie?  Oh, my goodness.  You pretend she's Jimmy.  We're going to shave her head, lump her ears up, and take her chin away.  No, that would be embarrassing for me, though.  I'm sorry.  You're a cutie.  I don't know if I could do that today.  Why?  I don't know. 
[03:06:00]  We had like a little breakthrough.  I really wanted to fuck a guy off the streets today.  You guys really had gotten my hopes up for that.  And I'm really disappointed.  What about a guy right there?  Okay, fine.  All right, let's go.  Who's in?  Raise your hand, fatty.  Oh, the guy goes, I want to.  I want to.  Who's in?  How about a hand stimulation?  What?  You guys have this thing with, uh...  Come on.  You want to let her play with your penis with her hand? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, the guy's bummed out.  Why?  Not allowed.  What do you use this for?  Checking off?  He already got in trouble for showing me his cock.  By who?  By who?  Fucking magnifying glass company?  Ted's magnifying glass company.  That's right.  Jesus.  Jesus.  That's right.  By Nobu.  They thought he stole one of the mushrooms.  Let me get greedy on that one.  The black dude who's always here.  Yeah, a hand release.  You were kind of like raising your hand. 
[03:07:00]  Come on.  When's it ever going to happen again?  When's it ever going to happen?  A hand release.  I love the brothers.  Okay.  She loves the brothers.  You said okay?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Really?  All right, good.  We're in.  Damn, how'd that happen?  Should I go back to...  What am I doing?  Was that Jehovah's Witness a brother?  Hey, Brie.  Am I watching?  Yeah.  Do I?  Was that Jehovah's Witness one of the brothers?  No.  No?  Oh, yeah.  God Almighty.  Let's bring Earl in.  Let's bring Earl in.  Earl.  Get Earl.  You know how warm he is right now?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:07:30]  What?  Clamoring for Earl.  Pull him in.  Just pull him in.  Let's get another person thrown off the Ron and Fez show.  Jesus Christ.  We're trying to figure out if he's gay, bi, or just not into sex in general.  Earl?  Okay.  Earl.  Hi, Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Cool.  Brie Olsen wants to jerk you off.  Hi.  Hi, Brie.  That's Brie.  She's my wife.  I'm kidding.  Earl, would you let her jerk you off?  Sure.  Earl thinks we mean promise him a job, then not give it to her. 
[03:08:00]  Thanks, Ant.  Any racist joke makes me laugh, Jimmy.  No, it wasn't racist.  It was just about jerking somebody off.  I promise him things and not give it to her.  Oh, okay.  I don't like that she has Al Pacino flip-flops on.  Don't try to bring that bit back.  Look at her flip-flops.  We got it.  Oh, hello.  Hey, Ant.  Earl?  Yes.  Brie Olsen wants to take care of you. 
[03:08:30]  God.  She wants to just masturbate.  She wants to put a little lubricant on your penis.  Yeah.  And stroke it and look at you.  Uh-huh.  Dr. Jimmy.  That's what I'm saying she wants to do.  Yeah.  Sit down, Earl.  Little lubricant on your penis.  You might feel a little pressure.  And then you'll shoot a load in your pants.  Okay.  Are we going to do it?  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  Now, don't be fucking, like, don't be shocked by the lack of stereotype that you're going to feel.  Okay.  Now, is she going to kneel? 
[03:09:00]  Sure.  Will that be uncomfortable for you?  No.  Okay.  Um.  I don't know what we're doing.  You're going to masturbate.  Well, it's just going to, you know, okay.  I made stickies in my pants, Anthony.  Wait, do you have a lubricant?  We're getting it.  Well, let's just see what she's, why don't you see what he's, uh, sporting there.  What do you see there, Brie?  A black guy.  Oh, she's laughing.  That's not a good sign.  She's giggling.  Do you have a big cock for me, Daddy? 
[03:09:30]  Sure I do.  Are you married?  She's not with me.  No.  I left it at home.  Oh, that's too bad.  I love married men.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  Say yes to dope.  I am 38.  Oh, that's a little young, but I'll still take it.  I want you to undo your pants.  Hey, Jimmy, can you see what's going on over there? 
[03:10:00]  Happy to help, Hope.  Do you have boxers on?  Yes.  God damn it, there's no wireless.  What do you do here?  Ron and Fez.  Nothing.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She's grabbing what appears to be the last bite of flat licorice.  Remember, our new sponsor, Tootsie Rolls.  That's right.  What is allegedly adult male genitals?  That's right.  What's going on, Brie? 
[03:10:30]  I could have you shot for this.  Yes.  You have a nice body, too.  Let's not get carried away.  Make him take his clothes off.  This is great.  Yeah, get naked for me, too.  Earl has the sex appeal of Dwayne from what's happening.  Smile.  The deleted scenes from a patch of blue.  Why is no one getting lubricant?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, you have to do that.  Yeah.  Get lubricant.  Get.  Earl.  There's plenty of lubricant in her mouth. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, put some lubricant on Morpheus' cock.  Yeah, why not?  He can't perform in front of all these people.  Morpheus.  I was just watching that last night.  Earl, are you having some performance anxiety?  Oh, God.  Look at her fucking...  Brie, you are amazing.  Brie is lovely.  What's happening?  Earl.  Earl, what's going on?  What's happening?  I understand.  I wouldn't be able to get an erection either in front of all these people.  Can she come back and sit on my lap while this happens?  Yeah, do you remember what happened last time?  Get the fuck up.  What happened?  What happened?  Do you remember correctly? 
[03:11:30]  What happened?  When we went into the secret room.  Yeah.  Into the bathroom.  That's Earl's office, right?  Yeah, that was Earl's office.  Oh, now you have one.  Shoot, relax.  Oh, he's got one?  No.  You fucking...  Oh, shit.  Wait, wait.  Give me...  Watch this.  You can jack off now.  He's hard.  Fucking tattletail.  Oh, this is the prospect of black cock.  People love the interracial.  Do they?  All right, what's going on with Earl?  Who is that?  You know, I mean...  It's not me.  He said...  He whispered in my ear that he needs private time. 
[03:12:00]  He needs private time?  Yeah.  He said he needs...  What, a time out, you little baby?  What do you need?  He needs to be alone with me.  Where?  To get that big black cock nice and hard.  Well, let's see what you're made of, because...  Yeah, let's see if you...  Earl's not going anywhere.  Fuck Earl.  See if we get it in you.  Yeah.  Fucking Earl.  Hang on, I'm going to take my iPhone out of here.  Shove your fucking eyes and make believe you're alone with her.  Exactly.  This radio.  Just pretend it's New Year's Eve.  You're by yourself.  Pretend it's 1860, and this is the wife of the plantation owner. 
[03:12:30]  And if you don't perform, there's going to be trouble.  And if you do, there will be too.  Someone's writing, angry Hugo is writing, please hold my balls.  You should take the earphones off.  You should not even listen to the shit they're saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Earl, just focus.  Be a goddamn man and focus.  Take your headphones off.  What are you, sweetie pie?  Focus.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  What's going on, Jimmy?  I just keep looking at her hiney.  Yeah.  Maybe show Earl the, you know, the guns.  Wow, we here.  Guns?  Earl, what do you think of that?  You're going to put a gun to her head?  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  What?  I know.  Yeah, I feel my big titties. 
[03:13:30]  I would shoot a pound of cock.  I like big natural titties.  No, I check sitting on my...  Yeah?  That's good.  Oh, fuck.  I was thinking about sucking your cock.  Yeah, you're fucking my face.  Here, hold this with the other hand.  Yeah.  Damn. 
[03:14:00]  It also feels so good in my pussy.  Earl was looking at her.  The way the RCA dog looks at the television.  It's the unsexiest look I've ever seen in my life.  He's like Private Pyle with that stupid smile on his face.  Let's hope he winds up the same way on the toilet in five minutes.  That's it, Charlene. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  All right, she's...  She's grabbing for the lube.  All right.  Bree, is there anything going on down there?  Yeah?  Yeah, put some lube on that.  Craig from Long Island writes...  We're just going to pull it out?  What do you want on...  Okay.  It isn't good.  Oh, my God.  Only 45, 50 people in here.  Who cares?  What was wrong with the cock she got? 
[03:15:00]  You were good.  You weren't ready to see it.  All right.  Where are we at, Earl?  She's pulling Earl's penis.  Go ahead, Earl.  Don't be shy.  Why am I whispering?  I don't know, but I like it.  That's right.  Iraq, what's going on over there?  She's me.  Exactly.  Earl, you get arrested for that.  For what?  Disguising that as an adult male penis.  I got it from a Negro.  Is there...  What's going on, Jimmy? 
[03:15:30]  He's titty-fucking her.  He's titty-fucking my wife.  That's called real fucking rule.  Jesus.  I'm going to look at her vagina now.  Jimmy, can you tell us what you see?  What I see is my future ruination.  I see many, many years of loving that. 
[03:16:00]  Can you shake it and ask it a question?  I don't want to interfere.  Right.  Back to the action.  Wow.  She's really bouncing on that.  Wow.  She's got Earl's dick, apparently, between her two ample tits, and she's bouncing up and  down now.  Earl's doing his Michael J. Fox impression.  Titty-fucking.  Do you understand?  Yeah.  I want to take her off the pill and then fuck her.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[03:16:30]  And Danny and Sam are on the floor like two kids watching A Christmas Tale.  Except for looking at the vagina of the beautiful woman jerking off an incompetent producer with  her boobies.  He is the least deserving guy to have this done.  Yes.  You should say that when he gets a paycheck, too.  Yeah.  His dick looks like hot licorice. 
[03:17:00]  He's got a couch.  Oh, man.  He's got a chair.  Iraq is leaning across my lap to take pictures, and I'm still getting a hard hunt.  I can't.  Earl's black shoes are bugging me.  He stole his shoes from the poltergeist, too, preacher.  Earl, don't choke her.  Earl, look at his hands. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Easy.  Okay.  This is going to be a 400-year load.  Oh, look at that.  She looks like she wants a kiss.  She doesn't.  No.  She's going to put that fucking thing in her mouth, I think.  Oh, no.  What's going on, Bobby?  Huh?  What do you think is going on?  Somebody won't be kissing Jim Norton on the cheek.  Are they kissing?  Yeah.  There's a big kissing going on.  No.  There's no kissing.  She's Listerine.  Oh, there's no kiss for your friend. 
[03:18:00]  Are they kissing?  Yes.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like kissing.  And it's worse than I've ever had.  Oh, this is a horror movie to me.  This is a Freddy Krueger movie.  Wars were fought for this.  Yeah.  And unfortunately lost.  Jesus Christ.  Earl.  Oh, my God.  What is happening?  This is a...  I went from directing Spal...  Spal.  Pal talked to a Spike Lee movie.  Huh?  Yes.  Do the wrong thing. 
[03:18:30]  Huh?  Do the wrong thing.  Yeah.  Disappointed Dad.  Part two.  Earl's making out.  No way.  You're kind of choking her.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Excuse me, miss.  Will you blow me while this happens?  Don't show Jimmy that picture.  What's wrong with you?  Can I see it?  Don't show Jimmy that picture.  Let me see it.  I don't care. 
[03:19:00]  A little too much romance in that picture.  I've never had so much trouble adjusting the contrast.  What is it?  What is it?  Yes.  Co-clogic writes, Jimmy, that Bree's making a cuckold out of you.  Yes, but it's not with a...  It's with a bullshit.  Out of a bull.  All right, wait.  Let's go back to the action.  He comes over and incompetently fucks my wife.  Let's go back to the action, Jimmy.  Okay.  Earl is fucking her tits. 
[03:19:30]  He's got his hands by her neck.  Earl likes to choke white girls.  That's where it is.  Apparently so.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  He's fucking...  Oh, God.  Hey, Queen Strangler.  Let's try to keep the dildo box kicking over to a minimum.  Sorry about that.  Earl is trying to make cumsies.  I'm squeezing my shaft.  Do you understand we're making a Frankenstein monster out of this motherfucker?  We're going to turn him into a rapist.  Yeah.  He never gets this shit.  God, I can never kiss her now.  Huh?  You want to put your shirt on? 
[03:20:00]  Ron and Fez make him like...  Thank you for that.  Oh, what?  Did he...  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Did he shoot two?  Yes, he did.  Did I get...  Wow.  He fucking...  Oh, my God.  Earl.  Earl made cumsies.  Earl made cumsies all over her tits.  Earl made cumsies.  What would we do, that Marcel Marceau?  Jesus Christ.  Earl's cumsies sponsored by Ron and Fez.  New tits.  There's a deaf mute fucking coming. 
[03:20:30]  She has to go wipe that off before I suck her.  Earl, put your dick away.  Earl needs a new shirt.  Jesus Christ.  I'm not sucking those tits.  It's all up her arm?  It's all up her arm and shit?  I'm not sucking her breast for at least five minutes.  Wait, don't go out in the hallway like that.  We'll get fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're coming to me?  Yeah.  Wait, Steve.  She walked in the ladies room.  Steve, will you...  She needs to...  Yeah, get her somewhere.  I'll take care of it.  Here's my tongue.  All that...  Holy shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, that was fucked up.  That's good, Earl, to come on a black shirt.  That won't...  That won't show up forever. 
[03:21:00]  Jesus, Earl.  All right, that was the first time you came in how long?  Two years.  Two years?  Two years?  You haven't blown a load in two years?  He's still coming, by the way.  We should save that and sell it to the Chinese.  His shoes are fucked up.  His shoes.  It's two-year-old come.  Very valuable.  Wow.  You haven't come in two years?  Wow.  Yeah, just about two years.  How'd it feel?  It was fucking amazing.  What do you expect?  Jesus.  What the hell?  Wow. 
[03:21:30]  Earl, Jesus.  Wow.  I can't...  Earl, you ready for round two?  So you like it with girls?  I always like it.  Why are you wiping your mouth off?  You're wiping your mouth off?  What happened?  Yeah, I had lipstick all over me.  Oh, I thought you got some...  Oh, that's terrible.  What are you trying to be like?  Obama with that joke?  You got lipstick?  What?  Yeah.  Like lipstick jokes?  You can put lipstick on the producer, and he still fucks everything up.  I thought he was wiping cum off his lips.  No.  He's shot everywhere.  Wiping it on.  All of a sudden, I'm so glad I'm not the guy that she had a crush on. 
[03:22:00]  I don't know why.  But all of a sudden, it doesn't bother me as much anymore.  Why?  You see, the beautiful thing about being the guy she had a crush on is that it couldn't  be that bad for her again.  Oh, okay.  You're going to be the step up.  I am.  Oh, my God.  It's you.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  I gotcha.  Well, Earl.  There you go.  So that means we never get to see her, Bacucci.  Earl, by the way, what is the greatest show on radio? 
[03:22:30]  Besides Ron and Finn?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every fucking radio show on the air ever.  Who is the greatest radio show ever?  I won't throw this banana at you.  You better have the right fucking answer.  You guys, of course, right?  Of course.  And by you guys, what show is that?  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  That's right.  The Opie and Anthony show is the greatest show ever.  We don't put red fucking haired cocks in your face, do we?  No.  We put beautiful girls' tits.  We put the cocks in our own faces. 
[03:23:00]  Right.  We saved that luscious dick for ourselves.  That's right.  Why share?  Why share when you can drain those balls yourself?  Right, boys?  Get the high fives going.  Wow.  Opie's going to throw a banana at her.  Ron and Fez number three.  Fuck Ron and Fez.  No.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter anymore.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Bree Olsen, everyone.  Bowie.  Who's better than Bree Olsen?  She's a real trooper.  Wow.  And let's give it up for her co-part.  Co-partner here.  Damn.  Her what?  Her whatever.  I'm just nervous. 
[03:23:30]  Her co-partner.  What are you talking about?  For their first get-together.  I'm just a people pleaser.  His first coming in two years.  Thanks.  Wow, Earl.  That was something.  How was that, Earl?  It was amazing.  It was great.  Yeah.  Earl can now have a reason to celebrate on 9-11.  We've actually given you a reason to feel good about that day.  Because, believe me, that ain't happening again.  That's right.  What is that right there?  Turpentine?  It's lotion.  White out.  It's just lotion.  I just went and washed my hands.  Get black jizz off me juice. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, God.  But guys come so fast on your show.  I mean, it's so fast.  That was fucking lightweights, right?  Yeah.  That was like 10 minutes.  Lightweights.  You're just now a quick outcome.  That's just from, like, titty fucking?  I mean, I could never make a guy come in real life titty fucking.  What's wrong with you?  Earl, what's wrong?  If he stuck his dick in your pussy, he would come in two seconds.  Right.  Garen fucking titty.  He would come, like, on the stroke.  On the first stroke.  He would just put it in.  Yeah.  And pull it out.  And it would be over.  And you know, I'm not even doubting you on that.  Yeah.  With how fast.  You'd go like, okay.  How fast that was. 
[03:24:30]  Fuck it all up.  Wow.  Was it a lot of...  Was it a lot?  Yeah.  And I knew it, too.  I could feel it coming.  I'm like, oh my gosh, you're coming.  He's like, yeah.  I'm like, wow.  She's spraying everything.  Insecticide.  Everything she could find in her...  Fuckin' man.  She's got insecticide.  Mrs. Butterworth.  She's got a pump spray.  I can't believe it's not bigger.  Wow.  It was a lovely size.  It was lovely.  Yeah, you liked that, huh?  What size was it around? 
[03:25:00]  Like six?  Yeah.  Cool.  Average.  Average for who?  For humans.  Really?  Six.  It's like average.  What's wrong with you, Bobby?  Fuck.  I'm sorry.  Do you like the girl on your lap, Bob?  People took photos of your dick in the lake once.  Look at all the cum on Earl's black shirt.  Earl, you have ruined your black shirt.  What the hell?  You're a fucking...  You're a cum covered in confidence.  Earl was making s'mores. 
[03:25:30]  It's too bad we have to kill you now, Earl.  Yeah.  That's against the law.  That's in some states.  Wow.  I think we lost all the truckers today.  They are.  Oh, we sure did.  They're fucking on their way here.  We got...  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I am E-Rock.  And this is primetime Sam Roberts.  Both characters from the Opie and Anthony show that you know and love.  Sam, in this next segment, two opposite ends of the comedy spectrum. 
[03:26:00]  Brian Regan and Nick DiPaolo together in studio right here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  No, not at all.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Because it's a piece of shit.  Nick DiPaolo made the walk and Brian Regan made the walk.  Yes.  I think he wanted to go sleep, but I kind of said, come on, Brian.  Hey, you know.  We don't get to see you often.  Why don't you come by for another set?  You guys are so nice.  How do you turn down an invitation?  So thank you.  It's going to be hard because he's all sold out. 
[03:26:30]  He's doing nothing.  I know.  He doesn't even need to be here.  Why do I have to be here?  All I can do is ruin it.  People are going to cancel their ticket.  Really?  Hey, it didn't sound funny to me.  Where's Nick DiPaolo playing?  We had a nice discussion.  He's at his house looking for the fuse box.  That's what I'm getting at.  Me, Brian, and Nick had a nice discussion about being homeowners.  Yeah.  And we're all the same person.  We don't know shit about our own places.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  It's not fun for me to own a home.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a fun thing. 
[03:27:00]  It's fun to have like a house and everything.  But to actually be the homeowner and have to...  I do the absolute minimum at my house.  In the same way.  I can't do anything.  And it's too much.  And it's too much for me.  Like the other day, it was raining.  And this will...  By elitist fucking me, this will sound great.  I have the cover on my pool.  And there's pumps on it, on the top.  Because you can't have water gathering on your pool cover.  Why not?  Makes it for an ice rink, doesn't it?  Yeah, a little ice rink. 
[03:27:30]  And where the kids stomp or just trot upon it and fall in and drown and sue me for everything.  Exactly.  Watch Lou Costello cry.  Yeah.  Lou Costello.  And if there's too many leaves get in there, in the pump.  The pump's not going to pump the water up.  Oh, boy.  That's a problem.  You have to go out there, no matter how cold it is, with like a janitor broom, and pull  the pump away and then sweep the leaves off the cover.  Jesus, dude.  Why?  And then put the pump back.  And I'm like beside myself going, I'm working. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  I'm working over here.  There's immigrants you can call.  I know, but they're not there while it's raining.  Like today, it's going to be raining here in New York.  Yeah.  And I'll be out there sweeping my pool cover.  If something breaks at my house, I am at the complete mercy of whoever walks through that  door.  Whatever they say goes.  That's a good feeling, ain't it, bro?  You know, I mean, I know nothing about whatever's broken, but I always put like one token bluff 
[03:28:30]  in there.  You know, like the guy will come in and he'll look at whatever the hell it is, you know,  and he'll say, well, it looks like you're going to need to replace the whole thing.  And then I got to do my bluff.  Well, I was looking at it and I was wondering if maybe you could just like fix that one.  And then you go, well, with your labor and the parts, you know, to fix that, you might  as well get a new one.  And then I'm done with my bluff.  I'm like, okay, go ahead. 
[03:29:00]  We'll do a new one then.  I fold.  Yeah.  I'm out.  I'm out.  And how much?  Whatever you say, whatever comes out of your mouth, I will pay you.  Yeah, whatever you say.  They know that too.  You got to think.  It's probably just a rusty screw and they make you replace the whole unit.  You don't know.  The guy could say, you know, it's $6,700, you know.  All right.  And they're all kind of angry to these guys.  They're not happy they're doing this shit.  They always have like an edge to them.  Never a smile.  Oh, they're fucking kind of miserable. 
[03:29:30]  Never nothing.  Yeah.  Well, it's going to be this.  And they all have a different opinion.  I mean, I've had like five guys come out and look at my, you know, my boiler.  And they all shit on the other guy's job.  I didn't hook that up wrong.  What the fuck?  That's all hooked up wrong.  What clown did you have coming to you to do this shit?  Which is an insult to you because you hired the last guy.  Yeah.  Fucking.  And paid him when he left and looked at the work and thought it was fine.  My house was built in 1937.  So I'm supposed to know how the fucking.  Really?  I have to know where the two oil tanks are under my house. 
[03:30:00]  But she's just the thinker of the wonderful times back then.  I was just going to say that.  I don't know what you mean, Adam.  Nostalgia.  You've got to take that away with you.  Some wild shit went on in my house.  You didn't know where the history of that.  You didn't know where the fuse box was, Brian?  Electrical box.  Electrical box.  Yeah, that would be your breakers.  Your circuit breakers.  I don't even know what that is.  And this guy, you know, came in to fix something and says, where's the electrical box?  And I just had to say, I don't know.  It's the magic box of electricity. 
[03:30:30]  Well, this guy looked at me like, how is it possible that you don't know where your electrical box is?  I'm like, I don't even know what that means.  I don't know.  You know what?  I would tell him.  I called you to fix it.  Yeah.  So you have to find it and fix whatever.  The second you come in the door, it's your job to find it and fix it.  It's not my fucking job.  Yeah.  And he should know it's not going to be on the fucking dining room wall.  It's fucking, you know.  What do you got?  A closet or something.  You got a new house, right?  Relatively new house.  Yeah.  Something like that.  It's in the basement, you fucking asshole. 
[03:31:00]  It's a dining room.  Yeah.  That was pretty fucking funny.  There it is.  That would just hit home.  I don't know.  I just pictured you eating with a big pot.  Yeah.  The big fucking breakers is snapping behind you.  The big orange fluorescent thing on it.  You got the giant, you know, the giant spoon or fork that all Italians have trying to hide it.  Yeah.  Hang a potholder.  Put a big potholder on it.  Yeah.  A potholder.  You know, so.  I hate to suck on it.  Yeah.  What the fuck do you think this is?  It's in the basement, jerk.  It's in the spice rack. 
[03:31:30]  What the fuck?  I didn't go to school for it.  Look for it.  I tell jokes for a living.  I get 20 minutes on you and you leave, you dick.  Brian and Cherry Hill writes, I'm a new homeowner.  My bathroom fan stopped working.  It needed just to be cleaned.  I paid $168 for an electrician to do it.  Oof.  See?  Wow.  Just open the window and go like this with a times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oof.  I got major, major fucking work on it at my house now.  It's like major construction in the basement.  They're finishing the basement.  And all, I just hear banging noises and stuff and write checks. 
[03:32:00]  That's pretty much the extent that I'm doing.  Banging noises.  Banging noises.  Just sit down there banging and shit.  That's it.  All right.  Write another check.  It's not even working.  They could leave like a soundtrack down there and, you know.  Yeah.  Just let a tape play on the loop.  And they crawl out the basement window and you're just hearing bonk, bonk, bang.  They go into their truck, throw some sawdust in their hair and come to the door.  Check.  What the fuck is happening?  3,400.  Actually, I have a mic set up. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  They're going, I'm hooking my house up so I never have to leave it is what I'm doing.  Really?  We didn't know that.  I'm so tired of society.  Society.  I hate it, man.  I'm just building an oasis in my house.  Home theater's going in downstairs, which is an actual movie theater.  Because I got tired of going to the movies.  I can't fucking sit in a movie.  You're like soulmates.  I can't go.  None of us.  God bless you got the money to do that. 
[03:33:00]  I can't take it.  I can't handle people talking and opening up their snack.  How can it take like five minutes to open up a cellophane wrapper?  Just rip the thing open, you know, and get it over with.  And you hear, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Are you trying to make it like less obvious?  Yeah.  I couldn't take the movies anymore.  Well, they shocked the workers when you said to not put the whites only sign.  I need two drinking fountains, please, down here. 
[03:33:30]  One that has water and one that has arsenic.  But it's an actual theater.  It's not even one of those home theater where it's like, I got a home theater.  You got your TV.  And then you sit on the couch and watch.  This is movie theater seats.  It's going to look like an art deco movie theater.  Really?  Something from the 30s.  I want that whole look going through.  Can we come and dial one?  Of course, please.  I'll need friends.  I want to see Shittler's List. 
[03:34:00]  I have nothing.  And then in that, you leave the theater.  And then there's a bar.  Because I'm tired of going to fucking bars.  So I'm going to have my own bar in the basement.  And TV set up for sporting events and whatnot.  Bathrooms down there.  All kinds of other rooms.  That's where we're headed.  That's right.  A video and audio recording studio.  That's where we're headed.  So that at some point, I hope I'm probably going to get a line down there and do the show from my basement.  Oh, really?  And then I will never have to leave. 
[03:34:30]  There's other shows that have done this.  And I'm like, of course, that's what we're going to do eventually.  I'm a big monitor.  You'll have one here.  Tom Bernard in Minneapolis.  I was just there.  That's right.  That's right.  We'll talk to each other.  I'll look at the big monitor.  We'll see.  We'll do the show that way.  And then my door, I'm just going to weld it shut.  I'm going to weld my fucking doors shut.  I did a show like that one time where the hosts weren't there.  The hosts were like at their house.  And I'm like, what the hell do I got to be here for?  And they're like, well, pretend like they're here.  Oh, I got to sit here while they're like in.  Were you just talking to the TV?  I just did that two weeks ago in Minneapolis. 
[03:35:00]  Tom Bernard.  Really?  At his house.  But you have to come.  Yeah, you feel like I have to go to the studio.  Yeah, you go into the studio and sit there.  Why can't you just call into that?  And I was really overdoing it.  I was like, wow, you look good, man.  It's a nice band.  I was just really piling it on.  Jesus, those shoes.  What do those cost?  Oh, they're nice.  So it's just you in a studio with this asshole at home?  And like, well, his sidekick still had to come in and he produces and chips.  There's a few shows like that.  What's the one out in L.A.?  That's the one city I sell tickets in. 
[03:35:30]  The one in L.A. does that now.  Adjust the hue and tell him he looks a little peaked in a little green.  I was going, you know.  That's fucking, that's got to be a little awkward, though, talking to a monitor like that.  Who is that right?  There wasn't even a monitor.  No?  No.  You're just like doing a phoner?  Yeah.  From the studio.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  All of a sudden, I don't monitor nothing.  It was your show and you were interviewing the host.  When you said monitor, do you mean like visual?  Yeah, I thought you were able to see him.  No, no, no.  So he's just in his drawers there at home.  In his house, yeah.  Sitting around scratching his balls. 
[03:36:00]  And you've got to pretend like you see the guy across from you.  Yeah, hey.  That sucks.  Oh.  Wow, that's rough.  It's already like the easiest job in America.  Now it's show up.  Just at least show up.  You've just got to show up and talk.  How hard is this?  Also weird is when you.  That's my dream, man.  Sometimes you do a phoner.  Fantastic.  You do a phoner, you call in, and they tell you that they're taping it to pretend like it's  three days from now.  Yeah.  And my brain isn't good at that.  Oh, that's got to be great.  Hard to lie.  It's hard.  Yeah.  Hey, did you see that thing two nights ago on TV?  How about that nuclear? 
[03:36:30]  The game?  How about the nuclear bomb that went off those terrorists?  Yeah.  How about that bomb that's going to go off on Wednesday?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's going to be something.  Yeah, and it'll sound really good as you're doing bits, and there's some kind of world  catastrophe.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and you're making light Pop-Tart jokes.  You didn't know about the big calamity?  Calamity.  I'm talking about the calamity.  The fucking radio stinks. 
[03:37:00]  Have we lived through a calamity, you think?  Was 9-11 the calamity?  9-11 was a calamity.  Do you think that's a calamity?  Jesus, I guess.  The Katrina was a calamity.  Tsunami, the fucking...  For them.  Yeah, those are calamities.  The further away the calamity, the less people care.  Who's the boss?  Calamity is my new favorite word.  I love a good calamity.  Calamity.  Calamity.  Fucking radio.  That's an old west word.  Like, calamity Jane.  Yeah.  She must have been a pisser.  Yeah.  Hey, calamity. 
[03:37:30]  What the hell came for that name?  That was Calamity Jane, wasn't it?  A slight mishap Jane.  It's a calamity.  Calamity Jane.  They just mixed up the fucking words.  You got the movie theater.  You got the bar.  What about the strip club?  I've seen that basement.  You got room for a strip club, too.  I'm thinking maybe the bar, if I could...  Well, we got the strippy pole that we don't use here.  Maybe we could take it down there.  Take it, yes.  I got that little part of the wall that goes in.  Maybe we could put it there, and that'll be right near the bar.  You got to get one of those showers.  The part of the wall that goes in.  Shower?  Isn't that called the corner? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, well, it's...  Two walls meet, and it goes in.  You haven't seen this house.  It would be a big house.  They finally got to the corner of it.  No, a stripper shower.  Not a regular shower.  A stripper shower.  No, it's just a pole.  Fuck them.  Where are you going to get the girls?  No, I mean, legit, really fuck them.  You can bring them up to your room and have them fucking...  Oh, I got a big shower in there.  You got an elevator?  Ah, wow.  How about an elevator?  You should get an elevator right down to the basement. 
[03:38:30]  Get a freight elevator with the fat ones.  For the pigs.  You got to get the Batman entrance, so they don't know how to get to your house.  It's such a guinea house, though.  Like, I had to incorporate real guinea things into it.  Marano glass?  Like, when you walk in the front door, Angela, who is Keith's wife, she did all the decorating  in the house, because I was just fucking waste.  I'm not going to sit there and look at swatches.  I'm not going to look at pink chips and see what the fuck...  That's not your job.  That's for women and fans. 
[03:39:00]  That's it.  Just...  Exactly.  You do it.  I'll pay.  I just want it done.  And she did a fantastic fucking job.  So I said, I want a chandelier in the entranceway, because it's very high.  It's a big double door thing.  I want this, like, a grand entranceway.  So she's showing me these things, and they were, like, this wrought iron thing or something  else, and I was like, nah, you don't seem to understand my heritage and my background.  I want the biggest, gaudiest, crystal fucking chandelier, and now I got this giant thing. 
[03:39:30]  And the place where the mount is is kind of inset, and I said, I want it painted like gold.  I want this...  So it's just pure guinea.  Pure fucking guinea.  He could have weddings in his...  I had to have them.  There's Roman columns in there.  Oh, I love them.  It's like columns.  Inside.  I was just sitting there.  Yeah, inside, I have columns.  What's painted gold?  The inset.  There's like an octagon-shaped inset.  Yeah, what a fucking ginsel. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, it is.  I want the liver to look like the Colosseum.  That's what I want.  I'm like Caligula with a fistful of lard.  You stand over.  You stand between them like Samson and pretend you're going to...  I'm like, I'm going to knock this fucker down.  You should open your house for wedding photos, man.  People would appreciate that.  Fuck that.  Sounds...  I can't wait to see it.  Fuck it.  Oh, it's a fun place.  You know what it is?  The columns are there because they cover up lolly columns because I want open room.  I want a lot of...  I don't like a house where you feel like you're in a maze.  It's a lot of hallways and walls and shit. 
[03:40:30]  So this thing is like really open.  And in order to do that, they ought to put these columns on to hold the beams up, and  then they ought to surround them with something.  So fucking Roman columns.  That's what I want.  I'm putting a coliseum in the backyard so I can fucking...  There's a fucking tiger in the kitchen.  Tigers and Christians and gladiators.  I really did just go all out.  I'm a fucking piece of Long Island white trash that got lucky.  Fuck that.  Good for you. 
[03:41:00]  That's pretty much it.  You got some Howard Hughes in you too, bro.  What?  That I piss in jars and leave them all over the house?  Let my nails grow really long and filthy.  I walk on tissues.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He was a crazy guy.  I know he's a germ nut, but I know more than that.  Wait, he walked on tissues?  Yeah, he'd put tissues on the floor and walk on them.  There were tissues everywhere.  He roped off areas where he would walk and everything else was just fucking trashed.  He had a certain amount of tissues, directives, that you needed to open the cabinets or the 
[03:41:30]  tuna can, you had to have five cushions of napkins.  Yeah, yeah.  Really fucked up.  I think it was Kleenex.  I was just watching a documentary.  Kleenex, yeah.  And I think he sent out a memo to his staff saying the proper amount of layers of Kleenex  that you need to touch stuff was eight.  Eight.  Eight layers of Kleenex to open doors, open cabinets.  He was fucked up.  Sounds like an easy guy to live with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was he like normal before that?  I mean, there's this footage of him acting like a normal human being when he flew the plane  and everything.  Did he become a nut or was he always like that? 
[03:42:00]  I think over time he got married.  He was kind of always crazy like that, from the movie anyway.  I don't know how accurate that was, but his mother kind of fucked him up.  He showed signs in high school.  He used to bring a shit sandwich to school.  But apparently he was an engineering genius.  Yeah, he was really smart.  He would work three days at a time and then collapse for 24 hours.  He was crazy.  Good life.  Yeah, he would just stay up and he would buy out contracts of these Hollywood actresses 
[03:42:30]  that he was obsessed with and then just have them watch movies.  Like, he would just make them watch movies all day, but he wanted to possess them.  He's like an OCD, obviously a fucking OCD number in a lot of areas.  That's like me.  Yeah, what a great job.  He did have his own screening room and I think he went down there to screen some movies  and he didn't leave for like six months.  I heard he just kept watching Ice Station Zebra over and over and over again.  What's that movie about?  I don't know.  I bet you he knows.  Yeah, he knows.  But that gets me fucking weirded out because I'll watch the same movies over and over again. 
[03:43:00]  I can make fun of them.  I can make fun of them.  I can't.  Me too.  Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock?  Come.  I got it.  I got it on a loop.  I watch the same movies over and over again.  Like at night, if I'm going to sleep, I need something on.  I can't just have silence or I sit there and just have my own thoughts, which I can't sleep to.  Put on Bill Curtis and his voice.  I put those on.  Bill Curtis.  Knocked me out like fucking ambient.  It was 8.05 p.m.  So wait, do you watch the movie?  In the town of Pomona, California. 
[03:43:30]  Do you watch the movie over and over again in the same night?  No, no, no.  Not in the same night.  But like if two nights goes by and I go to bed and I want to like go to sleep, I don't  want to put something on that I haven't seen or I'm going to be up watching the thing.  So I put on something I've seen a thousand times.  That's right.  So Gladiator will be on.  And I'll fucking just, you know, put on Gladiator.  Jerk off real quick.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Get a whip off a quick batch.  Of course, Back to the Future.  If that's on, I'll put that on.  I'll put on mindless, you know, movies. 
[03:44:00]  Alien or Aliens.  Either one.  Those.  I'll put them on over and over again.  I hate seeing the same movie again and again.  Oh, no.  I've watched it a thousand times.  That's why I quote this shit.  Well, I'll take a long break, like six months to a year and then maybe pop it in again.  No, I'm talking a couple of days can go by and watch the same fucking movie.  I need like five years, man.  Five or ten years.  If I see a movie, even if I love it, it's like, I don't want to see it again.  Oh, no.  That's why I don't understand, like, when you buy the DVD, it's like, I already saw the thing. 
[03:44:30]  Now I saw it, but.  I know.  Doesn't it imagine that people will buy your DVDs and shit?  No, but seriously.  As a comic, I don't mean that.  I didn't mean that.  Oh, that's funny.  No, but you're right.  That's true.  You know what I mean?  I didn't mean that.  Like, you know what I mean?  No, no.  Even a CD.  Well, they sell, you know, like they'll air a special and then you can buy it.  And it's like, obviously it works in my favor that people would.  But yes, I think that's kind of unusual. 
[03:45:00]  The worst is on, like, the History Channel does a thing where, you know, and then Hitler shot himself in the bunker and had his troops burn himself.  And the credits start rolling.  And it's like, if you want to purchase what you just watched, go to history.com and you can purchase the DVD.  It's like, I just watched it.  And taped it.  And it's not going to end different.  I almost fell for that.  And Hitler escapes in this version and runs off.  Yeah, it's like legend.  There's a different fucking match.  Played by Jude Law.  Yeah, different ending, an alternate ending to World War II. 
[03:45:30]  Hitler goes to Brazil and lives happily ever after.  Takes a wacky balloon ride with fucking Fanny Hill music.  While the Jews chase him with their fists in the air.  Using Jews as ballast.  Well, I would buy, if it was a different.  Drop another Jew, we have to go higher.  Jesus.  Yes, bro.  Oh, my God.  Fuck him, I'll fight him.  Fuck him, I'll fight him.  Yeah.  Fucking guy's getting fresh over here, Jimmy.  Fucking fresh.  You're getting fucking fresh. 
[03:46:00]  Ruined my party.  He had eight murders under his belt by that point.  He's getting fresh.  He had a party.  Ruined my party.  His party, three fucking people.  That's my new phrase, bro.  Ruined my party.  Ruined my party.  Horrible balloon.  Anytime somebody gets me mad.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  I like that.  Don't get nervous.  He tells the broad at his party.  The one broad.  Oh, look at this.  Stock market's lost over, what did it say?  Three trillion dollars.  What did it say?  Wow.  That's a trillion.  Yeah, we're all down again. 
[03:46:30]  Jesus Christ.  It's just opening right now.  Yeah.  Well, it means time for me to pop up my E-Trade account.  Good luck.  I should have fucking, I should short sell that goddamn Google.  Yeah, why won't you?  Because I'm chicken shit.  I know the second I do it, it's going up.  Yep.  No, it isn't.  You gotta short sell it.  Nothing's going up.  I've told you that.  I should have.  Always short sell.  I'd have made a fortune.  You fucking close you would have.  It's down in the 200.  It broke through the 300 barrier.  It's all about the puts.  Yep.  Puts.  Put options.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  I'll buy a large old puts.  It means making money even if it's stock tanks. 
[03:47:00]  Sell short sell.  It's all about the kids.  You can't lose.  Let's say it's all about the puts.  And you sound intelligent.  It's all about the puts.  They shouldn't allow people to be making money off it losing money.  Yes.  Everybody should be voting for it to make money.  No, but you can't.  If people are betting on it losing.  If you're bearish.  How do you do that?  I'd like to bet.  Here's what you do.  You have a stock.  I've explained this before, but I love explaining it to people.  Let's say you buy, their stock is $10 a share.  There's a stock, it's $10 a share.  It ain't serious.  Oh, shut up.  It's any stock. 
[03:47:30]  It's Widgets.  Widgets Incorporated.  All right.  $10 a share.  Yes, how about Ted's Hat Emporium?  I sell 10 shares of that stock.  I don't even own the fucking stock.  I don't own it.  But I could sell 10 shares that I don't even own.  How does that work?  You're just allowed to do it.  That's goddamn juice.  So I go on and I sell 10 shares.  I make $100 because I sold 10 shares at $10 a share.  So I made $100.  I got $100.  But now the people are going, wait a minute, you didn't own those shares. 
[03:48:00]  You got to pay us back for those shares.  I go, okay, I'll pay you back.  I wait a little while.  I wait.  The price of the share goes down to now $5 a share.  So now I pay them their $50 for the shares and I'm holding $50 going, ha, ha, I fucking  won.  I got $50 profit.  Even that little bit of logic throws me.  How does that help, though?  And we wonder why, yeah, the economies and the shit are big.  What if it goes up?  What if it goes up?  If it goes up, then you have to replace the shares at a higher price than you fucking paid 
[03:48:30]  for it and you're fucked.  That's what I'm...  But how can you do that if you don't have the money?  Say you start with $0.  $0, you sell the stock for whatever, and then the price goes up.  Usually you can't start with $0.  You got to put the money in escrow.  It's a margin account.  But you have to put more?  Because what if the price goes up?  Yeah, you need money.  It could theoretically go up above what you have, and then it's called a margin call.  And then they come knocking and say, hey, and if you then don't pay them, they sell 
[03:49:00]  off your assets, and they will sell off other stocks at any price.  Yeah, yeah.  So you could even wait how long?  I don't know.  It all depends on...  I could buy options for any month.  I could buy options for fucking next January if I want.  So you have until next January to pay them back.  And if it either goes up or down, I have to either sell it or exercise my options.  So somewhere between now and next January, you can decide when to sell it back. 
[03:49:30]  When to sell or buy the stock or something.  Why are we all rich?  That seems like an easy one.  It was back in 99, or 98, and then 99, 2000 hit, and I was up about $90,000.  Nice.  And, ooh, it all went down the shitter in a month.  Ooh, not nice.  Ouch.  I was selling options on vacation at Disney.  Dude, you used to...  I woke up, and I was like, option, option, all right, I made 20 grand, paid for the vacation.  What kind of options at Disney?  Tiny ointment for youngsters?  Yes.  At NAW, he was day trading. 
[03:50:00]  We would be doing the radio show.  Well, we were doing afternoons, so...  And I'd be ranting and raving about something, and I'm looking at Ant to come on board with  my rant, and he's like, yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good.  Trying to get out of stocks.  I'm like, come on, sell, fucking sell this, go through.  And I'm like, oh my God, he's not paying attention.  But it was afternoon, so it was like, you know, 4.30, the market closed.  That's an important time.  Or 4 o'clock, so...  I knew the show's officially...  It was an hour.  The first hour was going to suck.  I was going to say, the show officially started for us at 4.31.  The first hour was really going to blow. 
[03:50:30]  No one knows that, but I guess we can tell them now.  You're clicking in the background.  Yeah.  Clicking and clacking.  So come on, it's still going through.  I've got to sell now.  The price is falling.  Yeah.  Anything else on your mind there, Brian?  Oh.  Anything else bothering you out there?  I don't understand the economy stuff, man.  Yeah.  The mortgage meltdown.  I have, like, friends try to explain it to you, but they talk to you like you're a little  kid.  I hate when they're condescending and say, Brian, Brian, it's very simple, right?  You have a mortgage, right?  I'm like, yeah, I got that. 
[03:51:00]  And you pay your mortgage to the bank, right?  Yeah, I got that.  They bundle those with other risky securities and sell those to speculators, right?  Okay, I'm gone.  Am I supposed to still be with you because I'm way gone at this point?  No, a lot of people aren't.  Even people on TV that talk about it don't get that shit.  Seriously.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  No one knows.  How do you, you bundle them together, how?  With a rubber band?  I don't know what.  What is it, asparagus or starch?  It is true.  It's very, no one can explain that. 
[03:51:30]  I don't get it.  It's the only way to get the prime rate down is if you're going to, prime rate.  There it goes.  He's gone.  I have no idea.  There's no way to really explain that fucking finance thing.  Holy shit.  Speaking of, whoa, whoa.  They're back again.  The scaffold guys.  They just jerk off looking at us angry and waiting.  I can't believe there's not a better way to clean windows.  Every fucking six months, one of these things snaps.  These guys are cleaning this window every day.  We don't know why.  What?  What are you thinking?  We took their spies.  That's not great, Anthony.  They should do it from the street with lasers or a hovercraft. 
[03:52:00]  Yes.  It should be fucking high above the city.  But now there's still fucking cables, pulleys, and you're risking your life to clean a fucking  window.  Seriously.  You fucked.  You realize?  They have a safety harness.  But there's something else going on here.  The harness is connected to the thing that falls.  Which is hysterical.  There's an anvil on top.  A piano.  We think this is the CIA because they're cleaning this window every day and taking a peek inside  the studio.  How dirty is it?  We're a little paranoid by these guys. 
[03:52:30]  It's not even level.  It's like at a...  I look at these guys.  It's at an angle, man.  I think I should bubble the love sponge on it.  On one side.  Yeah.  It's tilting.  Left.  That would horrify me.  Hey, Jim, you want to moon them today?  Why would you risk your life to clean a fucking window?  We moon them every once in a while.  No, because they might complain to the building who already has this.  Oh, there he goes.  They're straightening it out now.  All right.  Well...  Look at these guys.  Why do you do this?  What floor are we on?  Uh, 47.  All right.  Look.  We're only on the fifth floor.  I know.  But after four floors, it really doesn't matter.  After 30 feet, you've got a 50-50 chance. 
[03:53:00]  That's it?  Yeah, that's it.  Wow.  After 30 feet?  How about the guy that fell 48 stories with his brother?  Remember?  He fucking lived!  He lived!  He lived!  I think he knocked the wind out of himself.  Jesus Christ!  How do you fall that fucking far?  Well, they were on like a piece of...  They were on the platform...  It had to be going down...  It wasn't going down full speed.  It couldn't have been, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, it fell full speed.  Yes.  His brother died instantly.  But, uh...  Yeah, there was a platform made of wood.  A piece of plywood that kind of got wind resistance. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, okay.  He got a little...  But still, I mean, I don't get this.  Slowed him down like a parachute.  It's not like a fucking magic carpet.  I mean...  He fell like a feather in Forrest Gump.  He got pretty...  His brother was dead instantly.  Aladdin just landed softly.  He got pretty fucked up, but he's now walking around like nothing happened.  Hey, uh...  That's a long way down, man.  That's a long way down.  Anthony, really fast, because we're talking about stocks.  We're almost at a milestone.  Nick from Pittsburgh is keeping track.  You guys are getting close to a milestone. 
[03:54:00]  Citadel stock is almost one one-hundredth the price you guys paid for it.  So he wants to congratulate us.  It's down at...  Look how smart we are, Brian.  We got in on what's called an IPO, my friend.  Oh, my God.  We got in with Citadel stock for $19 a share.  That's right.  That's right.  And I decided to go all in.  Attaboy.  You bought a share.  Oh, yeah.  One whole share.  It's now at 21 cents a share.  See, that's a fucking huge difference, man.  That's great. 
[03:54:30]  Wow.  That thing is at...  See, you should have done the selling thing.  They were...  25 cents or something.  What is it at?  21.  21 cents.  And dropped it.  We bought it $19.  Is that bad, though?  No, it's great.  It's good stuff, really.  Guys.  What's the product?  It's a radio.  You know, something we should know about.  Radio.  And we got in on an IPO, which is the initial public offering, which means we got in before  the public was even allowed to buy.  How much did it go up to?  So we got the cut rate price.  Once, it went up to $22 a share for a tenth of a second. 
[03:55:00]  It never went higher than that, right?  No.  I don't think it did.  I don't think it did.  I put 40 grand into an alpaca farm.  We might as well have.  We thought we knew radio, but I guess we didn't.  I either want to get into Amway or a pyramid scheme.  Where's a good old Ponzi scheme when you need money?  Nice chain letter?  Yeah, chain letter.  Where are the good old-time investments? 
[03:55:30]  You know, if you get old, because when you reach the top of the pyramid, everyone's got  to pay you.  Really?  I bring a grand to fucking a VFW hall, and who was falling for this shit?  A lot of people.  A lot of money in that white pot of pop for a while.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, after the break, someone with a huge head, facial distortions.  I think Colin Quinn is in the studio. 
[03:56:00]  Why even take a shot at Colin Quinn?  I don't understand it.  They're talking about Rocky Dennis.  It's hilarious.  I wish you wouldn't have said that.  When we get back, it's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, now and then, depending on the flow of the news and how the guys are feeling, we  have certain topics that the guys always go to.  This one, in particular, is Rocky Dennis and the movie Mask.  Sometimes there are movies that the guys enjoy discussing, and yes, Mask with Rocky  Dennis is one of them.  Usually these things mean they're a little bit, maybe, punch drunk, getting a little silly, 
[03:56:30]  and Rocky Dennis has always been a topic for a lot of hilarity.  Absolutely, and this bit here is no exception.  Even crutch topics are better than most other radio shows, whether it's Rocky Dennis or E-Rock.  Here it is on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Wait, no.  Just do it.  Just play it.  You're listening to the worst.  Holy shit.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, fuck it.  Oh, fuck it.  Yes, that's your answer.  That's your answer to everything.  I watched Mask.  Oh, very good. 
[03:57:00]  Rocky Dennis.  Very good.  Movie.  Yeah.  Holy hilarity.  Oh, my God.  When she touches, the blind girl touches his face, and she thinks she's touching like the  fucking mountain area of a train set, from a Lionel train set.  Stupid Laura Dern.  My favorite part is when Laura Dern's parents come to get her, and she's going, Rocky, Rocky,  looking around, and he walks over, and the parents, the way they look at him, oh, my God.  Oh, are they horrified. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, her.  Halal.  And when the camp counselor comes over and goes, all right, show me those pearly whites.  It's like, no.  Show me those fucking chiseled up.  Looks like he's been chewing on lock washers.  Lock.  What a big chin he has.  Oh, with his big, dumb chin.  And what were the fucking motorcycle gang, the Turks?  They'd hang out with some big-headed fucking freak.  Some stuttering asshole.  Mother had too much crank in her womb. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Mother's all fucking drugged out.  They wouldn't have sympathy for Rocky.  They stunk.  Take him to the carnival.  Go on carnival rides and bumper cars.  They're a biker gang.  They would have played.  Should be racking head and selling meth.  They would have played soccer with his head.  Yeah.  Yeah, his big head.  Oh, we have another clip from this.  Especially since he wrecked her pussy coming out.  They can't even fuck her anymore.  Thanks to old Mount Rushmore.  That fucking head.  Old Matt pinpuller.  Why didn't Ben want to go to Europe?  Was it something about that he was tired of Rocky sewing four hats together and wearing them? 
[03:58:30]  Dude, that was another thing I saw when his grandfather took him to the baseball game, the Dodger game, and he comes home all happy.  And Cher is just fucking all drugged out on the couch.  But he comes in all happy.  He goes, look what I got.  And he still has a baseball, and he's got a little Dodger cap on that giant head.  Really?  It is the funniest fucking thing.  It's a tiny little Dodger baseball cap on his giant disgusting head.  On his giant Mr. Met head.  Oh, that giant misshapen thing. 
[03:59:00]  So why didn't Ben want to go to fucking...  Ben, as it turns out, was living with his mom and not very happy.  He was going to school.  They had just graduated junior high.  And he decided to live with his father in another state because his father hooked him up with a job.  So instead of going to school, he quit school and got a job to make money.  Oh, but what...  And Rocky Dennis got all mad.  Had to pull the pins out of the...  And said, you know, you're just...  You're stupid. 
[03:59:30]  You're stupid.  Called him stupid.  Where were they going to go in Europe again?  Oh, everywhere.  Italy, England.  It was the whole fucking thing was full of pins.  He'd take his huge head on tour around fucking Europe.  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  He could have called Ringling Brothers.  They would have flown him for free.  Giving him first class airfare on Virgin.  Fucking freak.  Giant head.  Should be in a tent with gypsies dancing around it.  I got to see that movie again.  And then the people that just go, hey, you, over there, take that mask off so we can see who you are. 
[04:00:00]  He's like, well, if I could.  And he's like, oh, I'm sorry.  Take that mask off.  What's wrong?  My mom says I look like a lion.  Did she really say that?  Yeah.  That's what he told Laura Dern.  Because she was a lion.  When mom said I look like a red-headed bag of shit, it would have been more accurate.  Mom said I'm an embarrassment and a cunt wrecker.  Mom said I'm a pussy roiner. 
[04:00:30]  Because the size of my head looks like shitting a red-headed bowling ball.  I look like a lion.  Do you really?  You Burt Lahr sack of puke.  Shut up.  Her, her.  The blind girl-assist.  Touch my face-assist.  Yeah, she goes in for the touch and he just grabs her hand like, no, no, this is going quite well.  Exactly.  How could she tell, though, fucking after she kissed him with those filed down teeth?  Holy shit.  Yeah, that kissing scene was really disturbing. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, Rocky.  Rocky, come meet my parents.  And they were like, oh, well, it's time to go.  We want to beat traffic, the father says.  And then every time he called, the mother's like, no, she's not here.  She's having her, she's having her hair cut for three days.  Wait, I mean, I'm, I think you're kissing him.  It was like kissing a hot air balloon with like a gorilla's asshole taped to it.  That's probably what it felt like. 
[04:01:30]  Picture a fucking hot air balloon with a gorilla asshole in the middle of it.  And then his mother gets a fucking prostitute for him.  Because he was like, it's about girls, mom.  And storms off.  So she gets all tanked at a bar and goes up to a hooker and sends the hooker into the room with him.  And he doesn't even, you know, fuck her.  He sits there and talks.  First thing she goes, says, is what's wrong with your face?  Did she say it to him?  I think mom would have warned her.  Yeah, right?  Look, he's a nice guy.  You ever, how much to fuck a monster? 
[04:02:00]  What do they talk about?  They talk about their school and what she wants to do.  Like, she was a real person to him.  So, you know, they had a great time.  They were both monsters.  And then he talks about Mount Rushmore, how he can't wait to be a part of the team.  Fucking lunk-headed zelch.  That is the definition of lunk-head. 
[04:02:30]  His head is a lunk.  Wasn't the rest of his body normal?  Yeah.  The rest of his body was all normal, but he had that giant fucking head.  And the bridge of his nose was fucked up.  Yeah, that disease we just talked about last week on the show.  Oh, and then they were...  Heart giantus.  Hilariitis.  Hilari.  And then they were at the fair or carnival, and they went into the Hall of Mirrors.  And one of the mirrors...  You know how the mirrors make you look tall or short or something?  So he went into one that squished everything, and he looked at his face and saw, like, what  he would look like, kind of, if he didn't have that disease. 
[04:03:00]  And that was a sad moment for him, right?  And he's like, oh, he's looking in, like, oh, look, this would have been...  And you could tell they, like, took some of the makeup off of him and shit.  It just wasn't the mirror.  Don't bullshit me.  If I could pass these mirrors around to everybody else on Earth, they could hold them up when  I walk by.  Hey, can we see a picture of him, Danny?  Where is he?  Can you bring him a picture of a little rockster?  Put on his big fucking head.  Rocky!  Rocky!  I just...  It was so fucking great, though, watching it yesterday, because I know we always goof on  the map, but there's so many gem moments in there. 
[04:03:30]  His big, stupid head.  I can't wait to see him.  Oh, they're...  Oh, God, look at that.  Oof.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Eric Stoltz.  Wasn't that his first role, and you couldn't even see him?  Oh, that's Eric Stoltz?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I just realized that.  What do you think he was, Robert Plant?  That's how Robert Plant looks now.  Holy shit, you're right.  That's a good one, Jimmy.  Got a whole lot of love. 
[04:04:00]  Ah, look at him.  Oh, what a dumbest smile.  A dumb fucking smile on his face.  Big dimples.  He's got the eye man in him a little bit, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was...  I wish the picture of him with the Dodger hat was there.  It is so tiny on his head.  I gotta see it.  Oh.  He's freckled, too, with red hair.  And he fucking...  He got a baseball, too.  He caught a baseball at the game.  Probably because the hitters were just aiming for that giant head.  It was a good target for him.  They thought it was that giant thing in Milwaukee that pours a beer. 
[04:04:30]  That's one of the brewers that's at home, right?  Or the apple that comes out at Shea Stadium because it's red and giant.  It's red and huge and ugly.  And an eyesore.  His head was an eyesore.  Disgrace.  They had to build a barn around it because neighbors complained.  Zoning ordinances.  Let's go to Scott in New York.  Scott.  Oh, shit.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  How about that scene where he tries to get on the ride and the guy's like, 
[04:05:00]  I can't take responsibility.  What happens to the retard?  Yeah.  He goes, I'll take all your tickets, but we can't take the retard.  And then, what's his name?  I always forget his name.  The guy with the deep voice.  He was in Roadhouse.  Oh, Sam.  Sam Elliott.  Sam Elliott, sure.  Yeah.  He's like, you take all the tickets.  He's ready to kick some ass because he was a Turk.  One of the biker gang.  The Turk.  He was the lead Turk.  And they did nothing.  They hung out, drank beer with a big-headed dolt.  Exactly. 
[04:05:30]  And a fucking stuttering, fat member of the biker club.  Put the one with the tie.  Oh.  Which really does make it look like a fucking balloon.  That's when he had to go to the graduation, and he was mad because he didn't want to go  in jeans, so they told him to grab them another beer, and when he opened up the fridge,  a nice suit was in there.  In the fridge?  Yeah.  In the fridge?  In the fridge.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of the O.B.  and Anthony show.  Hey, it's Jim Norton.  Upcoming gigs.  This Wednesday, November 25th, one night only, Stress Factory in New Brunswick. 
[04:06:00]  The early show is sold out.  Late show.  There might be some tickets available.  Friday the 27th, day after Thanksgiving, Chickapé Mass, the ugh, kooky Lao restaurant.  It's a fine Chinese establishment.  And then Saturday the 28th, the Wilbur Theater in Boston.  And then Thursday through Sunday, December 3rd through 6th, I return to Caroline's here  in New York at Broadway between 49th and 50th. </pre>
