<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in vulgar self-introductions and boasting about their numerous arrests stemming from their show.  A substantial portion is dedicated to a contentious interview with shock jock Starr, who had faced legal issues for threatening a rival DJ's child.  Opie and Anthony criticize Starr's aggressive demeanor, contrasting it with their own history of legal battles and FCC violations, arguing a difference in intent.  Starr's disparaging remarks about the show's name being "gay" and fans' use of "O&A" are also discussed.  The hosts then dissect a negative column by David Hinckley (dubbed "David Stinkley") and play and discuss audio of Alan Sniffen, a dentist and radio message board commentator, criticizing their antagonism towards Whoopi Goldberg's new radio show, referring to them as "O&A pests."  Despite their initial criticism of Goldberg's show, they describe her in-studio visit as ultimately positive and productive.  They also received a gift of chocolates from her.

A lengthy segment reviews their "Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus" comedy tour in Worcester, Massachusetts. They discuss both positive and negative reviews, including a Boston Globe critique of the show's raunchy humor and unprofessional aspects (specifically citing poorly anchored stripper poles and a poorly executed "Miss Virus" contest where only the winner flashed the crowd).  They name several comedians who performed: Bob Saget, Tracy Morgan, and Ralphie May, detailing some acts and a recurring joke.

The show features extensive clips from the topless dancer film *Mondo Topless*, focusing on the announcer's colorful and absurd language ("paltitude," "dance of the muff") and the dancers' interviews. They compare the film to modern pornography and discuss a listener, Josh, whose mind is haunted by the announcer's voice. Another caller, Brian, points out the hypocrisy of not allowing topless women at the tour while showcasing Jim Norton's bare buttocks.  A still image from the film is compared to Jim Norton in a wig.

The discussion shifts to Louis Twitchell's meltdown at the tour.  The hosts recount Twitchell's emotional breakdown, with details from Kenny and Pat (who shared a room with Twitchell), describing his erratic behavior. They speculate on his mental state and potential removal from the show.  The segment concludes with banter about their clothing, targeting Bob Kelly's designer attire.

A rambling discussion follows, beginning with a suggestive hotel anecdote.  The hosts discuss a show guest's departure, referencing a "petting zoo" and a "dunking clown." A caller jokes about the number of people in black shirts, leading to a plug for their PNC Bank Arts Center show.  They relentlessly mock their boss Elo's "horrific" purple and white checkered shirt with vulgar jokes.  A brief, interrupted phone call with Bob Saget follows, discussing his stand-up, a bootleg YouTube video, and an upcoming NBC game show.

The show then turns to a co-worker's suicidal ideation, leading to jokes about OCD and hygiene.  This transitions into a heated exchange between Opie and Kenny regarding Kenny's perceived over-involvement in Opie's personal life.  They play a clip from "Molly Grows Up," an educational film about menstruation, sparking crude commentary.  More listener calls and discussions about the film ensue, filled with offensive jokes. The show concludes with plugs, a "Daily Dump Report" summarizing key moments, and additional commentary.

A segment focuses on a comedic audio clip of a man (possibly Petey Green) discussing the "proper" way to eat watermelon, using racial slurs and stereotypes.  The discussion involves the origins of the watermelon stereotype, Cynthia McKinney's political race, listeners' experiences with watermelon, the hosts' opinions on food and health, a contentious *The View* argument between Joy Behar and a guest ("the survivor girl"), and the influence of explicit lyrics on teen sexuality. A CB radio segment with racist jokes is also discussed.  Multiple callers contribute crude anecdotes.

The broadcast ends with a nonsensical joke about Digger's lips, followed by the hosts expressing their disdain for current rap music.  Opie delivers a vulgar rant on the "Opie and Anthony F.U. line," targeting various individuals and entities.  A caller, Scott, recounts using cocaine while listening to Paula Abdul.  A news story about a hit-and-run victim leads to discussions of personal experiences hitting animals.  A significant portion tackles the conflict between Twitchell and Kenny,  featuring accusations of verbal abuse, differing accounts, and escalating insults, with Pat providing a moderate perspective.  Callers offer character witness testimony for Kenny.  Twitchell announces needing a break due to stress and his Tourette's Syndrome. The show concludes with self-deprecating humor and more insults.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up!  Alright, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of talent on XM.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  O.P.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Palaver.  Good morning.  The art of the topless.  When I'm doing the topless, it's different than the exotic.  I feel more free when I'm doing the topless. 
[00:01:30]  I can't get it out of my head.  Mondo topless part three today on the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Thank God and fan.  Some would say same person.  Yes.  We got lots to do.  We want to get right into it today.  Good morning.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Good morning.  With wool Jimmy Norton.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hello.  The only virus spreading across America.  The phone number.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  Let's get into it.  Let's rock.  The phone number.  Write it down so we don't have to say this every day. 
[00:02:00]  Please.  Stupid.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  I'm kind of bothered by David Hinckley's column.  It wasn't bad, though.  Huh?  It wasn't bad.  I thought he was going to do it.  He didn't really get it, though.  No, I don't think he got it.  I'm called.  You know what I'm dubbing him today for that article?  David Stinkley.  All right.  You might have had to dump out of that. 
[00:02:30]  We had Starr in yesterday.  A shock jock that got in trouble.  Oh, my God.  Shocking.  He was doing very well in New York, and he was syndicated to other places,  and he went after a rival DJ's kid, basically.  Yeah.  Kind of like a pedophile thing that went on during his show,  saying what he wanted to do to the rival DJ's kid.  Yeah, and then put out, like, a $500 bounty on the location of the child,  and that stirred up some things.  He got arrested. 
[00:03:00]  He was acquitted of...  Actually, I think they dropped the charges, the DA.  Whatever it was, he just got out of trouble, legal trouble, criminal legal trouble.  Still some kind of civil suit.  Lost his job.  Yeah.  And millions of dollars, and now he's talking, and he came on our show yesterday,  and he was very confrontational right off the bat,  and I'll be honest with you.  I beat myself up yesterday about it.  I just didn't feel like going after him.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  He's such a douche.  I didn't feel like going after him.  I didn't like the guy right off the get-go.  Yeah, I didn't know what to make of him.  He's walking in, and he's like, kiss the ring, like we're in some crazy competition, you know,  who could do the craziest thing with their radio show.  I'm like, get out of here.  We ain't kissing your ring.  And then he thinks he topped what we did.  It's like, that's not why you're in here.  And then, Anthony, like you were just saying, you know,  you were trying to ask some questions to bring him down to kind of a human level. 
[00:04:00]  That's what this show is about.  That's what kind of got me is this show is about, like, let's just talk,  and, like, real people talk, you know, and real people goof around and joke and stuff.  But he wouldn't do that.  It was all about, like, hyping and trying to, like, portray this character and stuff  so it wasn't like a real conversation between human beings just sitting here talking about,  you know, we have things in common.  We were in radio.  We had been fired, FCC problems, legal problems, things like that. 
[00:04:30]  We had common ground that I would have liked to have covered with the guy.  But it was he had too much, like, anger in him and too much wanting to.  Nah, fake anger.  That's what I mean.  It's like an act kind of thing that he wouldn't come out of.  He's another radio phony.  And he wanted to come in here and make some headlines and beat us up.  And I called him out for being a tough guy.  But I didn't feel like going any further with the guy.  He wasn't worth my time.  I couldn't wait for him to get out of here.  I was really annoyed.  I don't know what to make of it.  It was like pro wrestling. 
[00:05:00]  You know, I'm not going to sit here and talk to a wrestler like it's real.  And then he's trying to say that the name of the show, when our fans call us O&A, that's gay.  And I'm like, your radio show is called Star and Buck Wild.  You've got a stripper name.  That was a reach, like, trying to get to us.  What are you doing?  Let's go.  That's the only way I saw it.  I didn't know at first, like, when he first came in, this is an awkward show to walk into  because of the reputation.  So people, I think, walk in here not knowing what to expect, whether they're going to get  attacked or whether they're going to get dumped on. 
[00:05:30]  So I didn't know when he walked in if he was just trying to, like, fit in and be, like,  because he's used to being the guy.  And then here you walk into this place where, you know, everybody's reputations were just  awful.  So just trying to be funny and fit in.  And it would come up as just awkward and uncomfortable.  Well, yeah, I think it's quickly, you could quickly pick up.  If you're a bright guy or girl, you can quickly pick up the vibe of this show.  If we're going to be hostile towards you, you're going to pick up on that right away.  If we're being cordial, which we were more than cordial to the guy when he sat down, 
[00:06:00]  you know, you're going to pick that up and realize that we just want to talk about what  we have in common and radio and, you know, the interesting behind the scenes things that  may have happened to him when he got fired.  I would have liked to have known the process of, you know, how he got thrown out, what happened  because, you know, it's interesting to people.  They like to know what happens behind the scenes, but got none of that.  He blew it, man.  He blew it.  He could have got some interesting stuff out.  And then he's trying to call Anthony out because he didn't, like, tell the black joke from the 
[00:06:30]  Crown Plaza Hotel from yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you know, like, you know, like, I'm sure he's done stuff like that on his own show  where he decides, I'll just leave it at that.  But he's now calling you out like you're scared to tell a black joke.  Can I rip down the 15th wall here for a moment?  And now we have to explain something else.  Sometimes, yeah, we tell, like, part of a joke or an idea of a joke because everyone knows what the punchline is. 
[00:07:00]  So you don't have to go there.  But he was trying to call you out.  It's like you're a security cat or something.  It's like, that's not what that whole thing was about.  Here's what the joke was.  Right.  Now what?  And then he's calling me Blondie.  I'm like, all right, I get it.  You're trying to be a tough guy.  Well, I guess Hinkley got it right by the headline reads, O&A Star Schmooze and it's a big snooze.  It was.  Yeah.  It certainly was.  And he got. 
[00:07:30]  We'd like to have made more of it.  After Star left, Opie said, I don't know what we accomplished with that, but good luck to Star.  I'm sure his next radio job will be great.  And no thing like, Greg Hughes said sarcastically.  It was a sarcastic comment.  Oh, my God.  Get the tape because it's like, yeah, I'm sure his next radio job is going to be great.  Although I don't know what we accomplished with that might set up sarcasm.  That doesn't normally, something normally nice doesn't follow.  I don't know what we accomplished with that.  True. 
[00:08:00]  That might kind of speak for itself.  But he's trying to say that he outdid us because he got arrested for his radio show.  And I'm like, are you kidding me?  We've had 20 people.  We counted.  It's around 20 people arrested for this radio show.  Have Anthony and I been arrested personally?  No.  Jimmy Norton has.  He's a full-time member of the show.  Yeah.  Steve has been arrested.  A whole bunch of our staff have been arrested.  So that means he topped us?  It was terrible.  I think what we did with the Sex for Sam, you know, alleged sex in a church, was a much bigger deal than what he's gone through. 
[00:08:30]  And he's walking around saying that, you know, he's the new Lenny Bruce and stuff.  He's got to relax.  You know what happens?  These headlines go away.  And then what do you got?  Certainly do.  And then what do you got?  That's what I ask you to do.  Then you got plenty of time on your hands to wait and see if you can get your career back on track.  That's what you got.  So I was just bothered yesterday that I didn't really go after him more, but... 
[00:09:00]  I didn't hate the guy.  I just...  I...  It was like, you don't have to try to be...  Wow, we saw it so differently.  I honestly did.  I hated him.  I thought when he came in that it was like...  Because he was just playing this act and he just came across so phony to me.  Trying to be like the alpha male in the room.  And it was like, come on, man.  You're not going to come in here.  Everybody's being nice to him.  Well, that's street, my friend.  That's just silly.  That's street.  But are you taking us being nice to you and Whoopi having come in the studio as all of a sudden all you got to do is bark and these guys cower?  Like, it's almost like, is that the vibe you have? 
[00:09:30]  I don't get it.  Right, right.  We were being nice to you, dude.  What's the problem?  Yeah, that was about it.  No one is intimidated by you or uncomfortable because you're here.  We wanted you here.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was just disappointed that it wasn't a better interview.  And I asked who started the whole thing.  What happened?  Did DJ Henry start it?  Did you start it?  How did he get started?  Right, right.  And he said, I don't remember.  Yeah.  And then he wouldn't talk about who was on the dump button that day.  It was like, all right.  There's such a different dynamic between the three of us that I think that's why this show works so well. 
[00:10:00]  Like, Opie's pissed and beat himself up because I think you wanted to throw something at his head.  I'm pissed because it wasn't a better interview.  I would have liked a better interview.  I just wanted to call him out on his BS.  Yeah.  And then I'm like, I don't think the show needs headlines with Star in the paper the next day.  I don't even disagree with Opie.  I mean, I was annoyed at myself, too, that I did more catch what he's saying earlier on in the interview. 
[00:10:30]  At first, I was like, ah, the guy's just joking around.  And I know how awkward it can be walking to a studio, especially with this reputation.  But after a while, it just started to seem like, come on, did you know we're not screwing with you?  Yeah.  It's a problem.  You're not going to come in and dominate in this room.  That's what this whole show is about.  When we have guests on here, it's not about – that's why some of the worst interviews on this show are when people don't get the vibe that we put off.  And they sit down and start running through everything they've done on every other radio interview. 
[00:11:00]  It's not the way we work.  We like bringing people into the show, whatever we're talking about.  Like if Star wanted to sit around and talk about any issue of the day or anything.  You know, he's been off radio for a little while.  Maybe he's got that built up in him where he's got opinions on the war in the Middle East or what's going on in New York or anything.  Ah, the guy's a phony.  He doesn't have an identity.  He doesn't know who he is.  I've read articles in the past.  That's how it came across. 
[00:11:30]  He wants to be known as the black Howard Stern.  Why don't you be known as Star?  We don't want to be known as –  He said he wants to be like Imus.  We don't want to be – that's what he's saying?  Yeah, in the paper now he said he wants to do what Imus is doing.  So why don't you just be Star?  Like we don't want to be known as the next Howard Stern.  We want to be known as the Opie and Anthony Show.  Going to look silly in a cowboy hat.  Yes.  Tell you that.  So I was –  Yeah, it's a street.  Can't talk about that.  It's something street and ghetto.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just annoyed.  I had to get that off my chest because I – that was a very confusing segment yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, and now Hinkley's writing about it and making a headline out of it.  I wish he would have just buried the thing because there was nothing really there.  At first I thought – I really did.  At first – the first minute I thought he was being a dick and then he said, no, no disrespect.  I was like, all right, he's just messing around.  He's trying to get comfortable.  Yeah, but then it didn't stop.  Wow, man.  I did not see it that way.  I saw a guy that – I'm not saying I'm right.  This is how I saw it.  I just saw it differently.  I saw a guy that was – he thought he could come in here and manhandle us and it wasn't going his way and he didn't have the chops to take it to the next level. 
[00:12:30]  That's what I saw.  So he was taking his little shots like St. Blondie and going after Anthony because he didn't tell the rest of the black joke.  Tell the rest of my black joke.  And kiss my ring.  I got arrested for my show so I'm bigger than you guys.  I'm like, what?  What are you talking about?  It's like a comedian come in, like you said, and just doing material, not talking and getting in the show.  That's not what it's about.  It's not what the show is. 
[00:13:00]  I don't like when comics come in and do their acts, set them up, you know.  So I hear you took an airplane here.  Well, I wish I could have set up like that.  Yeah.  Where do you want to go?  What do you want to talk about?  A lot of times you're going to watch the show and they'll say, where do you want to go?  What do you want to talk about?  Yeah.  John from New York.  Home.  Where do you want to go?  Home.  John from New York.  Star was a douche, but don't wait for the next day to bash him.  Opie's calling him out yesterday.  It was passive aggressive, but now you guys aren't.  It's a little weak.  No.  I'm not bashing the guy.  We're commenting on it because it was written about.  Come on.  Could you guys listen a little closer? 
[00:13:30]  God damn.  John, listen a little closer, please.  I said I was bummed that I didn't go after him.  I'm completely admitting that we should have taken it a little further.  You idiot.  And it was in the paper this morning, and that's why we're talking about it.  It was written about by John Hinckley, who didn't really get the point because it was such an odd interview.  Yesterday, and now we're just commenting on it, honestly.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  We got lots to do today.  We got Mondo Topless Part 3. 
[00:14:00]  It's being handed in as we speak.  Oh, here it is.  On a golden platter.  Wow.  Must be good, Than.  I can't stop talking like that one girl in it.  I walk around the house just saying, you know, when I'm doing the tab list, it's different than when I'm doing the exotic, which is more of a slow dance.  But I could really let myself go when I'm doing the tab list.  Well, here we go.  Listen to this. 
[00:14:30]  Some of the track.  Bust the babbit.  Some of the track listings.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  The Trouble with Pasties.  Ah.  Didn't need to wear a bra in junior high.  Some men want to get involved.  They aren't foam rubber, whatever that means.  Oh.  Feel the music going through me.  Of course you do.  Calls her bathing suit a jock strap.  And the music makes me feel sexy.  Sexy.  Oh, no.  The music makes me feel sexy. 
[00:15:00]  Sexy.  Not sexy.  And then, of course, the announcer.  Viewed from many angles.  The art of the topless.  Uninhibited frenzy.  I love that guy.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We got Mondo topless today.  We got the dentist commenting about the O&A pest.  It's Alan sniffing.  A lot of critics out there.  We got some reviews on the O&A traveling virus and the Worcester Gazette and the Boston Globe.  What's that?  We started in Tucson yesterday, too.  Did anybody know that?  No.  No clue. 
[00:15:30]  We didn't know until after the show.  No clue.  Hello, Tucson.  Hello, Tucson.  No clue.  So, yeah.  Hello to Arizona there.  Tucson.  Arizona's a nice state.  You ever been through there?  Best looking people in the country are in Arizona.  Very nice.  Phoenix.  Colorful state.  I love it.  I think it's in Tucson, but it's in Phoenix.  And to my left, Jimmy's going to open it up for us.  We have a gift from Whoopi Goldberg.  Ooh.  All on the way. 
[00:16:00]  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  O&A party rush.  I know.  I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  That sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Is it?  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:16:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony.  That's right.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We got to get into the Alan Sniffen thing right away because we have lots to do.  Making a lot of headlines lately, so we got to kind of clean up a lot of these storylines.  Yeah, loose ends.  Today we clean up the Whoopi Goldberg storyline. 
[00:17:00]  The quick review here, Anthony, or overview of the Whoopi Goldberg thing.  Whoopi got hired to do morning radio here in New York at first,  and then she's going to branch out, syndicate to other markets around the country.  She's never done radio before.  Of course, you know her from her movies and her character on Star Trek The Next Generation.  And we kind of goofed around on her that she never did radio,  and it's going to be a David Lee Roth debacle.  Kind of goofed around on her? 
[00:17:30]  Kind of goofed around.  I'm kind of slowly getting into the fact that we hammered her show repeatedly for days on end  about how silly, can I use the word silly?  No, how like crappy the subject matter was.  She's going to have a tough time making a name in this business  just because she's not doing what Whoopi's good at.  Yeah.  She's trying to do a nice radio show.  It's going to fail miserably.  Oh, wow.  You're still standing by that.  Oh, I said that to her?  You could be friendly and still say, you're going to fail. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, she should really do that edgy comedy, and then she might have a shot.  Well, you know, do you think that the powers that be over there will let her,  when they see like she's not making any headway, will just go, okay, go ahead, be Whoopi.  They're going for the chicks.  And I hate to say it to the chicks listening to us right now,  but radio in general thinks chicks want to hear nice stuff.  And the three girls that are listening right now are taking that to heart.  They want to just hear nice things from their radio show. 
[00:18:30]  And we say BS.  The women have potty mouths as well.  They do.  They're filthy whores, some of them.  And they like the edgy crap as well.  Yes, you do.  So then we goofed on her, beat her up a bit.  The One Pest got a hold of a radio show and got through many, many times,  making it kind of miserable for her because she couldn't do any phone calls and stuff.  Couldn't take the calls from the women.  So then Whoopi had the balls to walk into our studio and confront us.  And we don't have anything against her personally, 
[00:19:00]  so we kind of ended up having a really, really good time with her.  Turned out to be a very cool woman, so what are you going to do?  And we have no problem with how it ended.  None whatsoever.  Okay?  Alan Sniffen from the New York Radio Message Board.  The mecca of all radio message boards.  He's got a jingle.  Here's Alan Sniffen.  All right, this is Alan Sniffen, and this is Board Reflections for August 4th, 2006.  MusicRadio77.com.  Board Reflections, where I make comments about comments being made to the New York Radio Message Board, 
[00:19:30]  the mecca of all internet radio message boards.  Things being discussed on the New York Radio Message Board.  See, he runs the New York Radio Message Board.  He's run it for years.  But he's a dentist.  All right, it might sound silly to you and me.  No, it does sound silly.  And New York is the number one radio market in the country.  Market in the country.  And this, I will tell you, is the number one radio message board, at least in New York, if not in the country. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know of any other radio message board that gets as many hits, as many radio professionals come to it,  like people that are in the business.  Everyone goes there for their news.  Yeah, they go for the news.  Anything that breaks in New York radio, it's there first.  We all go there to start rumors, start our rumors about ourselves under fake names.  You know, it just happens.  But Alan runs this message board. 
[00:20:30]  He did radio, I guess, years ago in Poughkeepsie.  Did he?  For a little while.  Yeah.  And, but he became a dentist.  But he still has this love for radio.  So the guy that runs the New York radio message board is a dentist.  And he's got his opinions.  And everyone's entitled to it.  And this week he talks about the O&A pest and how their idiots think it's negative, but it works for O&A.  And of course the other...  Oh. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, sorry.  Oh, that was his drill.  You scared me.  Rinse.  Yeah, we think in between cavities and root canals and stuff.  He runs into his office to, you know, clean up the New York radio message board and get a few posts in and a few comments in.  And then he runs back down to see how you're doing.  Tell me when your lip gets numb.  I'm going to be... 
[00:21:30]  I think...  It's so bizarre to me.  All right, here we go.  And of course the other side show to this whole thing was the Opie and Anthony Whoopi Goldberg deal.  O&A really took off on her, I guess, earlier in the week on their show and try to get their listeners to call her up and give her a hard time.  The O&A pests, as they call them.  As I would call them, the O&A idiots.  But that's okay.  And again, I get it with this stuff.  I'm just not turned on to taking your audience and turning it against other people. 
[00:22:00]  I don't like it when they do that with TV hosts.  I don't like it when they do that with reporters.  And I don't much like it when they do it in this case either.  I just think that's kind of crummy stuff because it encourages this aggressive negative behavior.  It brings out the worst in your listeners when you say, hey, it's okay to go give so-and-so a hard time.  I just don't care for that.  I don't like it as a technique, but okay, it works as far as Opie and Anthony are concerned.  That's just my view of it.  You don't like it? 
[00:22:30]  It makes for some great radio.  Aren't you in the highest suicide profession?  You don't have the negativity.  Every friend you have has shot themselves in the last six weeks.  Alan, what's the matter with you?  I like his radio voice, though.  Yeah, he gets into it.  So here's more from Alan Sniffen.  Whatever else you want to say about Whoopi's show one way or the other,  she handled it perfectly.  Perfectly.  I don't know whether it was her idea, whether somebody around her is advising her or whatever, 
[00:23:00]  but to take the proactive move rather than sit there and feel these idiotic phone calls morning after morning  from the ONA pests, as they like to call themselves,  what is the mentality of somebody who brags about calling themselves a pest?  I mean, can you imagine the mentality behind that?  But that being said, rather than put up with that morning after morning after morning,  she instead decided to go right into the lion's den,  go into Opie and Anthony's XM studio after she got off the air for Clear Channel, 
[00:23:30]  and Tano Amano, as they say, one-on-one.  Great move.  Absolutely the best.  Yeah, it was a great move for both shows.  Yeah.  We all got headlines.  Doesn't he?  And we got people talking.  But people act like Whoopi just came in and took the bull by the horn,  which she was great to come in.  Mm-hmm.  We were happy to see her.  None of us had a hatred for her person.  It's not like, it's like we could have just been dicks when she walked in,  but why would you be?  It wouldn't be fun to do it that way.  Yeah.  It really is a two-way street. 
[00:24:00]  And, you know, it's like, it's almost, we try not to force things.  So, I mean, you know.  It can't be forced.  If all of a sudden there was a personal problem, then it could have got ugly easily.  But it wasn't personal.  We just thought her show stunk.  Right.  It was, you know, that's it.  But the subject matter we heard was her discussing sunscreen and its ingredients.  And we thought that was a really.  And prostate exams.  And prostate exams, which, you know, is a noble cause. 
[00:24:30]  But to tell you the truth, on radio in the number one market,  might be a little lackluster.  Might not get the listeners coming in droves.  Manners Monday.  Manners Monday.  So we brought this stuff up.  And hammered it.  Right.  And he just doesn't like to pass.  I'm good at all of him.  We love the ONA pass and what they can accomplish for this radio show.  We certainly do.  Opie and Anthony, to their credit, rather than acting like jerks when she showed up, 
[00:25:00]  they didn't.  And really, you know, Opie and Anthony don't act like jerks very often.  They're smart enough to take advantage of the moment.  And that's one of the things you need for morning radio.  You've got to be able to seize the moment, not sit there and wonder what you're going to do.  You just have to be able to react.  And they reacted appropriately.  They welcomed her in.  They had a nice conversation.  Everybody seemed to like everybody and so forth.  But, you know, it diffuses the problem from Whoopi's point of view.  Diffuses the problem.  Because now that she's made nice to them, and by making nice to them, she manipulated them into making nice to her. 
[00:25:30]  Once that's happened, the Opie and Anthony pests don't have any ammunition anymore.  Yeah, I guess they could call, but they're not going to be doing it with the endorsement of the mothership, the Opie and Anthony show itself.  So it's really going to reduce the hassle factor for her, which could be significant because they can drive you nuts when they're really angry at you.  And they didn't, Opie, and Anthony backed away, and the pests went away. 
[00:26:00]  This was a quick mission, Alan.  You know something?  Alan might be right.  We might have to now, because of Alan, just completely destroy her program.  But it's funny.  I said he didn't get it, that we kind of acted nice, and then the next clip is him getting it, that we acted nice.  Yeah, I know.  Jerk, I am.  Dope, I should listen to this stuff.  It was just a quick mission.  Yeah.  We realized it was easy to goof on.  We did.  Now we don't even pay attention to her.  I mean, I'm sure something will come up, and we'll go after her again. 
[00:26:30]  The pests are the armed wing of the show.  They're the armed, you know, the army.  They're pest-bollah.  They're pest-bollah.  We're Iran and Syria, and they're pest-bollah.  They're just launching rockets, see what happens.  You know, you pull them back.  If you see that the battle doesn't really need overwhelming force.  She's not a rival.  She's going for a different audience.  Good luck to her.  She's going for change.  It's not a long-time war like we have with Howard Stern. 
[00:27:00]  It was a quick flare-up.  That's it.  A quick little thing.  A quick little battle.  Extinguished.  That's it.  You know, when the U.S. goes and does a quick mission, like, ah, we were bored, so we decided to see what we could do.  It's like Grenada.  Yeah.  Something like that.  There you go.  We were never concerned with Whoopi or anything like that.  The art of the tapless.  Anyway.  What?  Opie and Anthony, here's to us.  Love, Whoopi.  Ooh.  Jimmy, open our gift from Whoopi. 
[00:27:30]  In case it's a bomb, he makes me open.  What do you mean, tapes of our show?  All right.  See?  Don't joke about it.  See, at any time, it could just get ugly again.  Don't you worry.  It's a big brown box.  Yes.  And there's a ribbon on it.  You don't want to open it up?  No, I do.  I just chocolate bar.  I'm just giving it, there's like a brown ribbon.  It's a very nice bar.  You know, on my way in, I heard you talking about a joke about a big brown box.  What was that? 
[00:28:00]  Let me reach into that big brown box.  It was actually funny that you let it go because everybody knew the pun plan did it.  Of course.  Well, what do you do?  Of course.  Can I reach my hand into that big brown box and see what's inside it?  I don't know.  Let me look first.  All right.  You're opening up the big brown box.  It's got foil on it.  It's sort of like one of those foil wrap things that go around something perishable.  How long has that been sitting in the office?  It's a giant wrap thing.  Yes, around something that has probably spiraled. 
[00:28:30]  I think we got it about a week ago because we've been gone for a while.  It's wrapped in some sort of space-age polymer, I would say.  Polymer?  I have no idea.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know what that is.  It's just something they used to say in commercials all the time.  Made of a space-age polymer.  Let's go.  What is it?  Chocolate.  Oh.  Lots and lots of chocolate?  Lots of chocolate and good chocolate, too.  Thanks.  Wow.  All right.  We're not going to.  Oh, no.  We won't destroy her gift.  No, it's very nice. 
[00:29:00]  We'll bring it over and let the interns eat it.  All right.  I'm going to eat it because I'm watching my figure.  There you go.  If you don't, no one else will.  Good point, sweetie.  Thank you, Whoopi.  All right.  Lots of very, very, very fine chocolate from Whoopi Goldberg.  Let's go to Kramer in Florida.  Kramer.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  I flew up from Tampa to see the show.  I had a great time.  I took three of my buddies with me.  I'm about to hop on a plane back down to Sunshine State.  You flew up just for the O&A traveling virus?  Of course.  I even told my mom that's why I came up.  Not to see family. 
[00:29:30]  I came up to see the boys to support the show.  We had a great time.  I lost my voice.  It's still gone.  I don't know what's going on with my voice, but, yeah, it was great.  And the reviews, I got to tell you, the reviews are nothing but positive.  I mean, there's a few, you know, a few negative reviews.  Negative Nellies.  But in general, everyone enjoyed their time at the O&A traveling virus.  We're going to make some slight adjustments before we take it to the PNC Arts Center in  Holmdel, New Jersey, August 26th. 
[00:30:00]  But I think we're in pretty good shape.  I want to say thanks to one of the other pefs.  My camera died, and one of the other guys was nice enough to take a picture of me.  With all three of you, he's going to email them.  So if he's listening, thank you.  And I'm about to hop on a plane, so take it easy, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Just a little phone message and then tells his itinerary like we care.  We got our review in the book.  What's your confirmation number, sir?  We got our review in the Boston Globe. 
[00:30:30]  Deadway.  What did they say?  Well, the headline's not too promising.  No.  Raunchy humor and bad behavior get tiresome.  Oh.  Worcester.  Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony have some work to do before their traveling virus tour lives  up to its billing.  I don't like work.  As the comedy event of 2006.  Do we really have our work cut out for us?  I mean...  No.  Was this guy at the same show?  People were laughing for three straight hours.  Some people were getting standing ovations after their sets. 
[00:31:00]  Saturday's show at the DCU Center featured an impressive list of comedians.  Bob Saget, Tracy Morgan, and Ralphie May, and ONA show regulars Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill,  and others.  But the show is a little rough around the edges.  By the way, there's a bootleg copy of Bob Saget performing at the ONA Traveling Virus doing  really dirty full house material.  Yeah.  I was watching that on YouTube this morning before the show.  You might want to try to search that out today. 
[00:31:30]  The exhibits in the Opie and Anthony Village and the stage set had the homemade look of  a demented homecoming carnival.  I did say this to Anthony, I guess in the office, that it kind of looked like a bad high  school play and we got to really work on the set.  Yeah, that's what we got to work on.  Look, you're talking...  Would movie?  Yeah.  We don't have much of a budget.  We'll be honest with you.  But I think we could do a little better.  The pole would move if a woman of her size was trying to dance upon it.  Cut.  Print.  Perfect.  When we went to the DCU Center before the show, hours before the show to check it out, 
[00:32:00]  and Pete showed me the stripper poles and they weren't anchored down, I'm like, oh no.  This is trouble.  This could be trouble.  It's just a prop.  But see, the problem is we really wanted girls to dance around the stripper pole.  Yeah.  So they need to be anchored down before we go to the PNC Arts Center.  When I say no more pretty strippers, because they can't get naked, so enough pretty strippers.  You know, you bring up a good point.  I want fatties or old people. 
[00:32:30]  But a lot of people liked the strippers, even though they weren't getting new.  They had, like, sexy outfits on.  I say we have a little variety.  Well, let me tell you something.  You get some midgets to strip.  You get some fatties to strip.  You get the hotties to strip.  I understand, and I don't really understand.  I don't understand at all.  Why am I even saying that?  You can't have, like, naked girls, full naked girls dancing on a stage like that in that venue for some reason.  I don't know.  For me, I think it's fine. 
[00:33:00]  But how about as little as is humanly possible to wear?  These girls had skirts on, stockings, frigging vests on.  I mean, what's wrong with a G-string and, like, pasties for the tablets or just, like, something?  The art of the tablets.  The art of the tablets.  I mean, anything.  Like, a very small bikini top and those underwear.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Black shorts are even shorter than bright.  Boy shorts are the hottest thing going right now.  Hot shorts are even shorter.  They like boy shorts.  Hot shorts?  They like boy shorts.  A little shorter on the side?  A little shorter.  A little more hiney shorts.  Yeah.  See, the boy shorts, much better than the thongs at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  Much better.  What about that?  Why not more scantily clad so you can really undress them with your eyes and it doesn't take much time?  In all fairness, we had to start somewhere and now we make the show better.  Now we step it up.  Stripper pulls that aren't going to fall over.  How about that? 
[00:34:00]  Good start.  Come on, Pete.  We don't ask for much.  Stripper pulls that are anchored down.  We want a stripper who's missing a limb.  Ooh, now that would be good.  I want a stripper who's missing an arm or a leg.  If you can get one missing a head, even better.  Probably harder.  An arm or a leg, gone.  Oof.  Yeah, we're not kidding.  Lopsided Heather Mills.  The One Village, we have to jazz up a bit.  Definitely.  Jazz up a bit?  A bit.  Yeah.  Anyway, so the stage set had the homemade look of a demanded homecoming carnival. 
[00:34:30]  I agree with that, actually.  Mm-hmm.  I thought I was back at Harborfields High School getting ready for Powder Puff.  Powder Puff?  Yeah, where a bunch of students put on some silly, silly skits.  I thought you did Bye Bye Birdie.  Oh, no, those were the plays.  Oh, okay.  This is when you just throw it in the gym.  The yearly talent show?  Yeah.  They called it Powder Puff or something like that.  Yeesh.  It's hard to be titillated by a woman dancing around a freestanding pole that looks as if 
[00:35:00]  it could tip over and send her flying into the front row.  Which would be hysterical, by the way.  So judging from the catcalls as the audience filled in, safety wasn't a distraction.  But this guy picked up on the fact that the stripper pole should be anchored down there.  Yeah, so they could use it.  True to the spirit of the radio show, most of the comics emphasize fun and filth with varying  degrees of success, with Rich Voss hosting the first half of the show.  So, Roxbury native O'Neal set the pace for the night with a litany of the most outrageous  sexual practices he could think of. 
[00:35:30]  You know, calling Patrice a native.  That's not necessary.  It seemed there was some sort of backstage bet between several of the comedians to see  who could come up with the most disgusting descriptions, and one particular joke was repeated  almost verbatim by O'Neal, Norton, and Morgan.  What was that joke, Jimmy?  Apparently it was that we all talked about a woman just, say, gagging, doing certain things.  Yeah.  Which is actually one I haven't done in a while.  It's a Luca Brasi reference I do, which I put on my first CD, so I haven't done it in 
[00:36:00]  about five years.  And I just felt like yanking it out.  A Luca Brasi reference is funny.  Come on.  He was obsessed with that, so I don't know.  I mean, you're going to get that when you get a lot of comedians in the same room.  Yeah, Nick, relax.  I mean, there are eight comedians.  We're all going to be fairly aggressive on stage.  The fact that three guys touch on that subject, I mean, you know.  Yeah.  What do you expect?  I'm not pointing out to a black comedy show.  All three of them pointed out things that white people do differently. 
[00:36:30]  Canton native Bill Burr had the strongest set of the night.  Robert Kelly, another Boston native, drew several people to their feet before he could even get  to the microphone, and the show reached its comic peak with Saget, who did his best to tarnish  any clean corner of his full house and America's Funniest Home Videos legacy.  But Opie and Anthony's introduction felt a bit anticlimactic, especially coming just before  intermission with a fairly dull coronation of Miss Virus.  Yes, that has to be.  We finally get to talk about that. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Man, we were put into a bad position, I got to tell you.  You know, when we were developing the ONA traveling virus, the people came to us and  said that BCN is running this contest, and we're going to crown, you know, Miss ONA virus  or whatever.  So, stupid us, we're thinking, really hot girls, yeah, this will be a no-brainer.  We'll get out, pump up the crowd, say a few things, make them laugh a little bit, and  then we'll get some T&A going.  It's no-brainer stuff, very easy stuff. 
[00:37:30]  Mm-hmm.  Just before we're hitting the stage, I don't know if it was Pete or somebody else said,  oh, the girls can't get naked.  Yeah.  They can't get naked.  That's nice.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  You're sending us out in front of like 6,000 people with girls, and they can't get naked?  These people are going to eat us alive.  You know, at the least, they want to see some boobs.  That's how these contests run.  And there's always a pretty girl there that doesn't want to, you know, show any flesh  because she thinks just because she's hot, she's going to win the whole thing. 
[00:38:00]  The crowd doesn't give a crap.  It starts out a bunch of hot girls, and then you try to figure out who the sluttiest girl  is, and then you give them the title.  That's how it always works, whether it's a wet t-shirt contest, a bikini contest.  It always comes down to nudity.  Yep.  And who shows the most?  Always has.  And always will.  Well, so we walk out, and the contestants start coming on stage, and there are a couple 
[00:38:30]  that were very good looking, I'll be honest.  Well, the winner is Kara from MySpace.  Yes.  Faithful listener of the program.  But, man, one girl, this just says it all.  One girl is on crutches because she had surgery to make one of her legs longer.  She told everyone backstage that she's on crutches because she sprained her ankle.  No.  One of the hottest girls up there in Worcester, Mass., was a girl that just had surgery to  make one of her legs longer so they match. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, that was a little distracting.  And I point out on stage, because now we're desperate.  We're just looking for anything that's going to get this crowd entertained.  I pointed out that she looked like she was five months pregnant.  Yeah, you had to, um...  The biggest belly.  A huge belly.  I mean, these girls were supposed to be hot.  She had a bit of a gut on her.  They're supposed to be hot chicks.  And there were only five of them, and one was on crutches.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  Who thought this was going to be okay? 
[00:39:30]  Kara's the only one that flashed.  Flashed the crowd a little bit.  And we took a chance, because if you were at the show, I went backstage.  I go, Pete, one of these girls has to flash, or they're going to boo us off this stage and  out of the arena.  We're dying out here.  By the way, the crippled and pregnant chick.  She's not pregnant, by the way.  That's where the gag is funny.  The picture, I'm looking at it right now.  It's on opianthony.com.  Lots of pictures up on opianthony.com.  So I go to Pete.  I'm like, one of these girls has to flash. 
[00:40:00]  Or we're totally screwed.  And Pete goes, they may arrest her.  So we went back out, and I talked.  I'm like, man, we have to get her to strip.  We'll bail her out.  Another person gets arrested.  Another person gets arrested.  But they need some kind of finale.  So she flashed, and we got our finale, but it wasn't that great.  And she won.  Yeah, so thank you, BCN, for getting five just terrific women for us to play with on  the stage.  Holy crap. 
[00:40:30]  You owe us.  That was part of the rough around the edges, I guess.  Yeah.  We're going to have to work on that.  Yeah.  So I completely agree with the Boston Globe review as far as our part.  Mm-hmm.  You know, we were in a bad position.  There was nothing we could do to make that exciting for the people in the stands there.  I mean, we could just go out there and, you know, host.  Just go, hey, and here, the next, you know, we'll bring up your next comic.  We're trying to do something. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  But, God, trying to compete with the laws and, ugh.  Yeah.  I mean.  It's so rough these days.  Hot chicks on a stage, if they're not getting naked, we don't want anything to do with them.  Yeah.  As far as interacting.  The girls, the dancing in hot outfits on the stripper poles that aren't anchored down,  that's a different story.  And again, if they can't get completely naked, we need them to be in as little as they can  legally be in.  And that's it.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  There were girls in, you know, one girl had a shirt.  It was up to the bottom of her chin.  It was like a turtleneck.  Hell is that?  I don't know.  And then Anthony Cumia kicked off the second half in the audience, now into their third  hour of comedy, seemed to tire a bit by the end of Ralphie Mae's set.  Crowd favorite Norton got things moving again.  A rambling Morgan closed the show, trying to out-creep Norton, a losing proposition.  Apparently, even ONA fans have limits.  Out-creep.  But in general, another pretty good review. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Tracy Morgan's getting killed.  And he shouldn't.  He's getting killed.  I don't think it was out-creeping.  I don't know.  I'm dirty, but, you know, come on, man.  Right.  So there you go.  What's the matter what you mean?  That's from the Boston Globe.  Oh.  If you want to know what the fans thought, go to whackbag.com and fba.com.  But you've got to spell out FBA.  Yeah.  Fullblown.com.  Am I right?  Yes.  They got some fan reviews. 
[00:42:30]  I think if you go to the PNC Arts Center or the Philly show or the Cleveland show, you're  going to be very, very happy.  Very happy.  It's a blast.  We'll make some adjustments and the show will be even better.  But we're very happy how it went up there in Worcester.  I don't want to confuse the issue.  I thought it was unbelievable for our first one.  Have we talked to Valby at all?  Do we know?  Or no, we're not sure.  I don't know.  I haven't talked to Pete yet.  We want John Valby to close the Cleveland show.  We really want that to happen.  If he can do it, yeah.  Because by three, three and a half hours into this comedy festival, people are very drunk 
[00:43:00]  and want to have a lot of fun.  So I think Valby would be perfect.  Yeah.  Perfect.  All right.  When we get back, it's time for the third installment of Mondo Topless.  Love this.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  How'd you like to contribute to the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, it's as easy as XYZ.  Before you even start, make sure, first and foremost, that you have something to contribute  to the show.  I have a relevant and topical observation that's sure to impress and work to the program's benefit. 
[00:43:30]  Great.  Now use your fat, dirty fingers and dial 866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-3733.  Now use that fat, ugly mouth of yours to pronounce and articulate every single word clearly.  Give your name and location followed by a brief and relevant description of what you want  to talk about, you know, just like a normal human being.  This is John from Philadelphia, and I have a comment on a relevant topic. 
[00:44:00]  Congratulations.  That wasn't so hard, was it?  Remember, it only takes one insipid caller to derail an entire talk show.  So take others into consideration before irresponsibly calling with nothing to add.  That's right, it's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Going to the instant feedback, Kevin from Connecticut. 
[00:44:30]  I watched the O.P. Jimmy rape video.  Aren't you supposed to commit a gay act, then say no, homo?  People were very disturbed by the video we made for the O.N.A. traveling virus.  We're going to have more videos.  Huh?  Jimmy was prefacing.  Yeah, that's even better when you preface than you know you're about to do it and you  still say it.  I've watched the video about 20 times.  It makes me laugh really hard.  Horrifying.  It's really horrifying.  It's up on YouTube.  It's up on opiananthony.com. 
[00:45:00]  It's getting a lot of hits and a lot of comments.  Jimmy's completely nude in it.  By the way, Steve, when are we going to get some audio of you singing?  Oh, I will produce it.  Steve was in a band.  Yeah, no, I have to find the CD.  I will bring it in.  I will bring it in as soon as I find a copy of it.  I actually have maybe one or two of them at home. 
[00:45:30]  They're just buried in a box after I move.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You ain't kidding.  Yeah, you got to bring that in.  We got a couple things we got to do.  We got to get you singing.  And, Than, we haven't forgotten.  No.  Than on the piano.  We learned that over at XM yesterday that he's quite accomplished.  The piano fan.  In the art of the piano.  Sing us this song.  You're the piano fan.  In the art of the piano.  Why did I try it twice? 
[00:46:00]  He probably did.  I don't know.  Sometimes maybe we didn't hear it.  What did you say?  That's what I was hoping.  But it was very obvious you heard it the first time.  No, I didn't.  What did you say?  Oh, boy.  I heard piano.  It's really not bad.  It wasn't bad.  It was bad.  Speaking of the art of the piano, let's talk about the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  Volume three.  Possibly ten volumes.  Really?  Yeah, it was a lot.  At least another three, right? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I'm halfway through.  We're still looking for this guy, too?  I hear the search is on because the guy that did the narration for this is still alive.  And, boy, would we love to talk to him.  The art of the topless.  Dave from Phoenix.  He might be a new listener.  He was naked in front of Opie.  What the F does that queer want?  A gay porn involving you two with no homo at the end?  Hmm.  Good point.  Good point, sir. 
[00:47:00]  Good point.  All right.  Mondo topless.  Yeah.  It's one of these videos that were out in the 70s.  This was porn.  This was porn back then.  And it was just, it's pretty much women dancing topless.  Some nude, but they kind of cover up their naughty bits with little prop items.  One is one of those hand warmers that women would carry around.  You ever see those things?  They're like rabbit fur, and they look like a big yodel. 
[00:47:30]  And you'd stick your hand in each end to keep your hands warm.  And they call it a muff.  You ever see those?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And one woman is covering her naughty bits with this hand-warming muff and talking about it.  And that's supposed to be, like, sexy.  That was porno back then.  And they're topless.  You could go deeper to find, like, hardcore stuff.  It doesn't matter what era you lived in.  Yeah.  But as far as, like, going to the theater and stuff, this was porno. 
[00:48:00]  You think they had porno in, like, 1830?  You have never seen some of that stuff?  Well, not 1830.  Every once in a while, you'd...  Paintings.  No.  Well, early 1900s and stuff.  I've seen the early 1900s and, like, classic porn.  Well, who did that?  I guess Hustler used to put in a picture or two from classic porn, they'd call it.  And you'd see, like...  Porn over the years or whatever.  A guy with, like, a big curly mustache.  And they're all wearing masks.  And he's just dogging some woman. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hardcore style, too.  And you're like, whoa, they were doing this back then.  All right.  She's got that Miss Crab tree from The Little Rascal's hairdo.  Only problem, the sex would be in fast motion.  Of course.  Whole thing would take 10 seconds.  What's this?  Great stuff.  It's still porn.  So even though Mondo Topless was the thing to do in the late 60s, early 70s,  you could go deeper to find the rank stuff.  Was he trying for a documentary with this? 
[00:49:00]  Some kind of documentary on the topless dancing craze?  Maybe he had to pass it off as art or as, like, an expose.  Yeah, maybe that way so he wouldn't be labeled a pornographer.  Then again, he was saying, bodacious baby.  Baby.  Lovely babette.  All right.  You ready for Mondo Topless Volume 3?  Please.  So for the new listeners, well, basically, it's just girls topless with this over-the-top announcer  describing what's going on.  And then they get to speak a little bit, and what they say is just so thrilling. 
[00:49:30]  Well, the trouble with the pasties.  The pasties.  We'll start here.  Listen to this.  To wear pasties, you know, you have to put on all that glue, and it's so hard to get off.  And sometimes the pasties slip, and then the glue shows.  Sometimes they fall off.  That's terrible.  Don't be broad.  Sometimes they fall off.  And that's terrible. 
[00:50:00]  I like that as a woman, though.  Like, that's the type of woman I want to date.  It is.  A 34D and a dope.  A complete idiot.  A big dummy with a little waist.  Babbling buffoon.  Huge bosoms who does nothing but stand there with her hands in front of her privates.  Pat Barringer.  Just an ass.  A complete idiot.  What are you doing?  Challenging myself to listen to a word you say.  You're a dolt.  It's hard to hear you. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Here we go.  This fine performer of the art of the topless didn't need to wear a bra in junior high,  and she has to tell everyone about it.  Oh, please.  Love her.  I like men.  Well-built men.  Skinny, scrawny men.  No.  But he-men.  Look like men.  And I don't like the long hair look at all.  I can't stand guys who go around with long hair. 
[00:51:00]  I didn't even really need to wear a bra until I was halfway through junior high school.  It all came late, but it was there, boy.  No denying it.  That's so dumb.  Wonderful.  All right.  We'll get the announcer on.  I need a copy of this movie.  It's great.  I have to see this.  I was telling the guys in the office today,  that I've seen the first half hour about 20 times.  I want to copy this today. 
[00:51:30]  Please.  All right.  Here we go.  Please.  A topless dancer must always concern herself with more than one angle of view.  Exposing her body as she must in Go-Go Discotheque,  she must attractively present herself to the many eyes of her admirers.  Go-Go Discotheque.  What the hell is that?  She's got to look good from every angle?  Yeah.  Is that it?  She can't have like a shotgun wound to her back? 
[00:52:00]  It's the art of the topless.  Art of the topless.  That's what makes it an art.  You've got to be able to show all angles.  Topless.  Well, they're not going to dump out if I say touch boobs, right?  No.  I hope not.  Who knows, though, these days?  Foreign woman not allowed to touch boobs.  Yeah.  She explains this in this clip here.  For example, you have the pelvic movement, which excited men quite a lot.  But just you can't do too close to a person. 
[00:52:30]  You have to stay in the middle of the stage.  But actually, a very slow and sensuous movement for the pelvic  would excite much more men than hard bumps and grind.  This I've always found.  And then, naturally, if you are, you cannot touch your bust at all.  But if a woman would very, like, arrest a bust, this would excite a man, I believe.  But you cannot do this on the stage.  Shouldn't she be telling people just to go on that their belongings will arrive separately?  It was moose and squirrel. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  Well, she's talking about the man.  I thought you were talking about how she can't when she's doing the art of the topless.  But she's talking about the horned-up dudes in the audience.  They're just trying to touch whatever they can.  Just trying to get a slap of flesh.  Trying to grab.  And some things never change.  Of course not.  Because you see that at the club all the time.  And a guy sitting there trying to get a grab.  And then the bouncer's got to come over and set him straight.  Have some respect for the ladies.  Yeah, shut up.  Unlike herself and her entire family. 
[00:53:30]  Good point.  Stupid strippers.  Some lap bands.  Shut up.  Some men want to get involved.  The women become very jealous, which is natural.  But they realize, I think the woman is smarter than the man.  Because the woman realizes that it's only a dance.  And it's only a form of entertainment.  Whereas the man, the male, becomes too...  We get it.  Possibly his imagination runs away with him.  And he thinks that, oh, isn't this wild? 
[00:54:00]  And he has visions of becoming involved with the person.  No.  See, he actually thinks this is an art form.  Oh, God.  And that the women understand this.  It is.  The art of the topless.  The man is smart because you spend your whole life trying to be demure and to be a lady.  And he goes, here's a buck.  And your shirt comes off.  That's stupid.  All those lessons your parents taught you.  Here's a buck.  And the shirt comes off.  Can't get past the fact she really thinks it's an art form. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And that women understand this.  But some guys want to get involved.  In their imaginations.  And their imaginations are going wild.  And back when this thing was made, you know it was a buck.  That was it.  These girls are dancing around for a dollar.  Period.  The art of the topless.  That's it.  And now, you know, you get these girls even in the local stupid strip clubs around your local little town that used to just be, you know, overpriced beer.  But a dollar would get you, you know, a dance in front of you or something like that. 
[00:55:00]  Now even they're trying to fancy it up for 20 bucks they want for a lap dance.  You want a table dance?  It's a corner gin mill.  Yeah.  It's a corner gin mill strip club.  You're not like a gentleman's club.  So stop it.  I hate those cabaret places.  I've never been in one of those cabaret places, like the higher class ones, where anything sexy has ever happened.  No.  The girls are way too hot.  But they're like plastic, not attractive, hot.  You can't touch them at all.  Their lap dances stink.  They're overly perfumed with glitter. 
[00:55:30]  It's like, oh, buzz off.  You want really good-looking regular girls.  That's what you want.  Good-looking, hot, regular girls.  Not over-the-top stripper girls.  For the art of the topless.  And in your corner strip club, stop trying to charge 20 bucks for a table dance.  Table dances suck.  One dollar.  Don't stand over my bottle of beer.  That's got to be – I remember, like, when I used to work for a living, I used to go to the strip clubs for lunch. 
[00:56:00]  A lot of times, a lot of the guys on the job sites, we'd go to the strip clubs.  And one thing I remember, which had to be so degrading to the girl, when she's walking along the bar trying to get a buck from everybody, and the guys would just kind of slowly put their hand over the top of their beer as she would step over each drink.  And then, you know, you pull your hand back.  As Bob Seger's playing.  Yeah.  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow? 
[00:56:30]  No, that was for the rug act, where she would take her quilt from her bed from junior high and, like, spread it out on the stage and do the rug act, where she would lay down and do something to a slow little ballad.  The sad part about the –  Who needs tomorrow?  The sad part about the rug act, you know Grandma, like, quilted that for her.  Oh, yeah, made the quilt when she was in junior high, maybe turning 13 or something.  Or she has, like, an old Wonder Woman one that she turns upside down so you don't see the Wonder Woman on it.  She's had it for years. 
[00:57:00]  Why did you have this?  Because it looks like me?  Oh, boy.  It looks like me.  Oh, see?  Really?  This is porn from the ages.  Classic porn.  But she looks like me with the hand behind her.  Look at her face.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Tim Norton with a wig on.  Jimmy with a wig on.  And, you know –  I was just going to say, she's kind of, like, hot if you chop her head off.  She looks like –  Oh, my God.  Like me with, like, an awful, like, an 80s hairband wig. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my God.  That's what I would look like if I sang in Winger.  Can we get this on the website?  That is hysterical.  Yeah.  It's Jimmy with the Quiet Riot wig.  That's the guy's wig.  Booty Sarzo.  We need this on the web with a split screen of Jimmy Norton because that is your face.  Well, there you go.  Porn from the ages.  This has got to be, like, the turn-of-the-century porn.  That's disturbing because her body isn't really that bad.  But then with the Jimmy face and the 80s hairband wig – 
[00:58:00]  Man, no muscle tone, though.  That's great.  I like that.  No muscle tone.  That's because she's a little sloppy.  That was then.  But she had, like, a juicy body, like a really feminine body.  Back then, they didn't know about working out or anything.  They didn't know what carbs are.  I'm trying to lose weight, so I'm only eating bread.  Oh, okay.  The Nautilus was just some wacky ship that sailed the seas 20,000 leagues under it.  All right.  We're working on getting that up on –  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  The website there.  Never against crashing myself for a bad reference. 
[00:58:30]  Let's say hi to Josh in New Jersey.  Josh, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Josh.  I've got to tell you that ever since you guys have been playing this Russ Meyer stuff,  I've got a running commentary of this guy in my head all day long.  Oh, you can't get enough of this guy.  When I get up, it's ridiculous.  Like, watch Darlene as she makes a PowerPoint presentation.  It's just ridiculous.  Yeah, the voice is in your head.  I've said Pat Barrington many, many times in the last week or so. 
[00:59:00]  All right, Josh.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Speaking of the announcer, here's another little thing from him.  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, a Nordic nymph whose paltitude is unrivaled by any showgirl in –  Her what?  I don't know.  I couldn't get past Greta Thorwald.  Who is she?  Wait, I've got to start this over. 
[00:59:30]  He came up with a new name for boobs.  What?  I love this guy.  Listen closely.  Come on.  What the word was.  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, the Nordic nymph whose paltitude is unrivaled by any showgirl in Denmark.  Paltitude.  Her youthful bosom, flat stomach, firm hips, and smooth, lithe legs all seem to unite in her wildly exotic dance, which she delivers in a burst of uninhibited frenzy. 
[01:00:00]  Greta Thorwald.  That could be the new name.  I love Greta.  How do you not love it?  The Dorwalds are here.  She's life.  He loves that word too, life.  Yeah.  What is she called?  The Danish nymph?  Did he say –  The Nordic nymph.  The Nordic nymph.  The Nordic nymph.  The Nordic nymph.  Oh, is this terrific. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, wow.  Hey, this might be a little inside.  New Yorkers should get it.  Bill and Waterford.  This announcer is the white-walled Clyde Frazier.  Cool.  He's always coming up with some crazy ways to describe things.  All right.  Back to the chicks.  They aren't foam rubber.  Uh-oh.  This should be good.  People who say, ah, she's phony.  That's all foam rubber.  I go, honey, believe what you want. 
[01:01:00]  I don't care.  No, that pultritude is real.  It's real.  Greta Thorwald.  I can't get enough of this Mondo Tartalus.  That's Baringer.  There just aren't girls with names like this.  We wanted to show this at the ONA Traveling Virus, and we were told no at the last second. 
[01:01:30]  We wanted this on the big screens as people were filing in.  Oh, who wouldn't want to see this?  It's just topless girls.  Why can't you show that?  What's the problem with topless?  The topless.  We can't show topless there?  I don't know.  It's the art of the topless.  We need a meeting.  We got to, like, readjust some things for the next ONA Traveling Virus.  We want Mondo topless on the big screen.  Doesn't Live Nation own these places?  I don't know.  We'll get into it with Pete a little bit.  All right.  Back to the girls.  There were several times people that have been drinking a little too much would get up 
[01:02:00]  and stand next to the stage and start dancing and taking off their clothes and everything.  It's hilarious.  Trying to get topless like I was.  The music puts me into a feeling of sex, and this is what I feel.  I don't feel anything around me.  I don't want to feel anything around me.  I want to feel only the music going through my body.  Whoa.  Men taking off their clothes so they can be topless like you? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, what?  I know, right?  Then I bit into the hot dog, and it started screaming.  Back to the announcer.  May need to set up to avoid a dump.  This is the dance of the muff.  Right, right.  We talked about this before now.  This girl, what she is doing is holding a hand warmer.  They are known as a muff.  You see them at ski resorts. 
[01:03:00]  Ski resorts.  They're made out of usually some kind of fur, maybe rabbit fur.  They're rolled into a little roll, and you stick your hands in each end of them to keep your hands warm.  Ladies do this.  The name of it is a muff, and that's what she's referring to.  That's it.  That's it.  Okay.  Here's the announcer.  The France has embraced the topless with wild enthusiasm.  Let us tarry for a moment in the provincial French city of Nancy, noted for its gates of gold, 
[01:03:30]  and drop in on dark-eyed Denise Duval, the voluptuous exhibitionist at Le Cabaret Sexy,  her tempting, teasing dance of the muff, spotlighting her breathtaking body,  never failing to bring male blood pressure to a fever pit.  Yeah.  He is much better than the girls.  You get a little something out of the girls, but it's all about the announcer, man.  Yeah.  The guy is the best. 
[01:04:00]  God, did he do anything else but this?  We've got to find out.  We have to.  Number two, and I have several, which I changed.  It's mostly a bikini bottom, or what we call a jockstrap, which slips just in the front and the back.  Ew.  It's called a jockstrap.  That's sexy.  Really?  Oh, let me put on my jockstrap.  Boy, they just didn't have the lingo down back then.  No.  Like, now they got it figured out to make it sound all hot, you know?  Way to take the sex out of the art of the topless. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  A jockstrap is the art of the shortstop.  Stupid.  When I put in my cup, it covers my, well.  You're making a split screen over there, right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  You've got to get a picture of Norton for the new listeners, but we're getting the old photograph up of this girl that looks a lot like Jim Norton in a wig.  There's the picture.  It's almost up.  All right. 
[01:05:00]  The music makes me feel sex.  Not sexy.  Makes me feel sex.  Sex, right.  I have trouble getting dresses because if I buy a dress, I would have to buy it big enough to fit the top and then take the bottom in.  Like, say, a size 14 dress I'd have to buy and then take in the bottom to size 8.  Almost any type of music makes me feel sex.  Also, color makes me feel sex. 
[01:05:30]  Color makes me feel sex?  Yeah.  Well, she likes the black dudes.  I think it's all about the acid she was dropping to forget about what she's doing.  The art of the what?  Yeah.  It sounds all nice, but, yeah, you've got to think these girls were doing some kind of dope.  These days, it's, you know, it's cocaine and champagne cocktails.  High in the Sierra Mountains.  Back then, it was all about just, you know, smoking the weed and a little acid to get their mind off the fact that 
[01:06:00]  maybe Daddy did something and now they're in the art of the topless.  Let's say hi to Josh in Dallas.  Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  At the beginning of the Muff Dancer skit, it sounds like Lil Jimmy playing the drums.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  Sorry, Jim, no offense.  Yeah, we'll go to a break with Back in the New York Groove if we can, if we can find that.  She said that any music makes her feel, uh, sex.  Sex. 
[01:06:30]  I wonder if any fire songs would make her feel sex.  Where's the fire?  Where?  Where's the fire?  Do you know how many people are annoyed that that got stuck in their head?  Of course.  I'm so happy.  It's horrible.  Spoil everything for you.  We'll play that next after the break.  Uh, okay.  Uh, back to the announcer.  He introduces Lorna.  Lorna.  Lovely.  Without artistic.  Huh?  Is it going to be lovely, luscious, or life?  Lovacious something? 
[01:07:00]  Um, Lorna.  Uh.  Lorna.  Lovely.  Luscious.  I'm going to say luscious.  Oh, no.  Luscious Sin.  Oh.  He already said luscious.  He'll use this luscious again, though.  Um, let's see.  Luscious.  Luscious.  Luscious.  Lovely.  Um.  Lovely Lorna.  Nah, he's too good.  He's going to get, uh, something better than that.  I don't know.  He can make lovely sound really good, though.  He just, like, favor pitch.  I got to go with luscious. 
[01:07:30]  Luscious?  Yeah.  I know it's been used, but I can't think of anything else.  I'll go with lovely.  All right.  Luscious.  Lovely.  Without artistic surrender.  Without compromise.  Without question or apology, an important motion picture was produced.  Lorna.  A woman too much for one man.  Nothing.  It's Lorna too much for one man.  Without apology.  A woman too much for one man. 
[01:08:00]  Its star was an incredibly voluptuous young actress.  The embodiment of physical allure.  Her name?  Lorna Maitland.  She was chosen with the aid of the film you are now viewing from 132 applicants who responded  to an advertisement in Daily Variety.  After filming was completed and the film Lorna was released to the motion picture theaters,  Miss Maitland had reason to be proud of the results and is now looking forward to a long  and successful career as an actress, let's listen to some candid post-production tape-recorded comments from Lorna Maitland. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, please, let's.  Wow, big setup.  She must be terrific.  Lorna Maitland.  She's got to be terrific.  Here she is, Lorna.  Yeah, I didn't actually notice anything at all from anyone, in fact.  I guess I wasn't thinking about it.  It wasn't on my mind.  I was working, and as far as I thought, everyone else was thinking the same thing, you know. 
[01:09:00]  I found no reaction from anyone.  By the way, that's Stan on the piano.  I remember the reaction on the ladies' faces.  I think they were staying there with their husbands, and they were a bit shocked, I think, at first.  You think?  A bit shocked at first.  Brian from Boston.  Guys, why is it not okay to show boobs at the traveling virus,  but Jim Norton's naked ass on a jumbotron is perfectly acceptable?  That's a good point, because one is sexy. 
[01:09:30]  Jiggly Jimmy Norton.  His bodacious backside.  Feel like Norton.  The art of the homo.  Wait.  Oh, sorry.  Smooth, amoeba-like skin.  Smooth where it counts.  Shaved like a booksom baby.  As hairless as a toad.  I think I enjoyed that scene quite a bit, 
[01:10:00]  because it gave me an opportunity to show another part of this Lorna character  that we were trying to bring an image about.  And I enjoyed that, because I like to bring variety into anything.  I think it's the spice of life and the spice of Lorna.  She's come up with that herself.  Variety is the spice of life.  Did you just say that, you dumb bim?  And then she said spice of Lorna.  Spice of Lorna.  They all have that affected voice. 
[01:10:30]  It's so odd.  Well, that doesn't disappoint.  There you go.  Mondo Topless, volume three.  God, I love it.  We'll get another one on maybe next week or so.  The ladies.  They're all lovely.  The announcer is so much better than the ladies.  I think they compliment each other.  You think?  Gotta say.  I like his setup, and then they're a little chatting about nothing.  It just shows how stupid they are.  I like the Nordic nymph.  What was her name again?  Greta.  Donna. 
[01:11:00]  Greta.  What?  Dard.  Look how quickly we forget.  We're a bunch of dummies.  That's a tough name.  Which one was it?  Waltdorf.  Now I'm thinking Waltdorf.  Listen to him tickle the ivories.  Luscious Nathaniel Bryant.  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chester Rockwell.  Smooth Lebanese arms. 
[01:11:30]  Let me just play this.  He's tantalizingly tattooed.  A big buxom bear.  Gourring at every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.  Chest shaved as smooth as a baby's butt. 
[01:12:00]  We're trying to get the listeners to produce some of this stuff for the Opian Anthony show.  Have you gotten any yet, Steve?  You just got the one from Coke Logic, right?  All right.  I just want to play this again because I've got to get her name.  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker.  Let us hurry.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, the Nordic nymph.  Thorwald.  Pulchritude is unrivaled by any showgirl in Denmark. 
[01:12:30]  Her youthful bosom, flat stomach, firm hips, and smooth, lithe legs all seem to unite in her wildly exotic dance,  which she delivers in a burst of uninhibited frenzy.  Greta Thorwald.  Just remember, door and a wall.  Then just throw a D at the end of it.  Thorwald D.  Thorwald.  He made Greta Thorwald sound sexy.  Yeah.  Greta Thorwald.  Greta Thorwald.  You know where Greta Thorwald must be right now? 
[01:13:00]  Looking like a Greta Thorwald in an old folks' home.  Greta Drywald.  Just sitting.  Trying to get someone to listen to her now.  I used to be a star in the art of the topless.  The what?  Back when we did it, it was an art form.  Not like now.  They used to call me bodacious.  Now they call me saggy. 
[01:13:30]  Pantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini Steve.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hope earrings.  Greta Dorwald is dead.  Oh, is she?  There's your reality check.  I don't know.  She's got to be.  She's got to be.  Really?  Think about it.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  What's up, Tucson?  The O.P. and Anthony show is on an extensive quest to find the most obnoxious 30 seconds of audio ever recorded. 
[01:14:00]  How annoying?  This annoying.  Hey, man.  Hey, it's Twitchell.  Hey, it's Twitchell.  Come on, jump to it.  Hey, it's Twitchell.  Then you got a call coming in.  Then you got a call coming in. 
[01:14:30]  Be yourself.  One ticket at a time.  One ticket at a time.  One ticket at a time.  If you can do better, email your annoying audio to Danny at foundrymusic.com.  That annoys me.  That annoys me.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Good morning. 
[01:15:00]  Hi.  Or good afternoon.  Some places take this show an afternoon.  Hey.  Whatever.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Coronavirus spreading across America.  Oh, if we come back and do it again.  What happened?  We do.  Oh, yeah, we do.  Yeah.  That's right.  We do two shows a day.  Yeah.  Club Soda Kenny.  Not feeling too good.  What's the matter, Kenny?  Kenny picked me up this morning and had to tell me that he's having a little problem this morning.  Mm-hmm.  Something to do with some bad ribs that were barbecued yesterday. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  I got a little stomach bug.  You got that?  Yeah.  It's more than a little stomach.  He said all day he can do a great impression.  He doesn't do many impressions, but he does an impression of a Yoo-Hoo dispenser.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I don't say anymore.  I don't trust you.  Yeah, I don't trust him either.  I don't trust you.  This happens all the time, too.  Like, we speak in code, and everyone gets what's going on, and then someone has to be 
[01:16:00]  Blurted out.  Obvious guy and say exactly what we were talking about in code, and then next thing you know,  they dump out, and then it's all ruined.  Believe me, we know.  Whatever we said is as far as it can go.  And we're getting smart, because now we're stopping people.  I can't tell you how many times we've talked in code about something very delicate.  Yeah, yeah, you're right, Toba.  And then blah, blah, blah.  And you're on it.  But it's been all morning, right?  And all night?  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of like when you're watching 3.30 in the morning.  Oh, really?  All night long?  All right.  Yeah.  You feel like pain?  A little cramping.  Lower abdominal pain?  A little cramping.  Yeah.  I would say that's probably a bug.  You get a pain, like, from your stomach to your kneecaps.  Like, even on the back of your legs.  How that happens, I have no idea.  I'm just chugging Imodium.  All right.  Is that it? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Are you helping?  Yeah.  Poor Kenny.  I'm all puckered up now.  Good boy.  Are you adding to the Jim Norton porno picture?  Yeah, we're trying to.  You've got to do the split screen because there's a lot of people out there, even though Jimmy's  a big star on HBO on Lucky Louie and all that, they still need a reference point why  this old porn picture looks like Jim Norton.  So, I've got to ask.  I still don't know the story.  I really don't.  Twitchell is one of our guys.  He's done a lot of great radio for us.  He was crying at the ONA traveling virus. 
[01:17:30]  He was supposed to be in the petting zoo, and what the hell happened?  I really don't know.  There was a huge dilemma with him.  I don't know.  He, look, nice enough guy, but he doesn't seem to be very stable, you know.  I think we saw that a few times in the studio, and with him being thrown under the bus so  much, some people can take it, some people can't. 
[01:18:00]  And I think he just snapped.  You know what?  Too bad.  All right?  When I first started coming on this show, I spent a night in jail.  I did some awful things.  You should have seen where Montana Gunn dropped an ice cube from, and I threw it in my mouth.  Yes.  I did some awful things on this show, and I had fun, and I lived under the bus.  I lived under it.  You've got to understand your role on this show.  You know, Twitchels is on this show because he's a comic with Tourette's that can't help  himself, and he does really stupid things, like slap his face, like jump when you say 
[01:18:30]  jump, and the noises he makes.  That's the reason he's on the show.  I don't really care about his comedy.  He might be a terrific comedian.  He might.  I don't know.  I've never seen him.  I don't care, though.  He's on the show for all the other stuff he does.  But I think he's confused, and he's starting to think that he needs a little respect on  the show now.  Yeah.  And there's been people in our past that thought the same way, and we kicked them out 
[01:19:00]  the door because we didn't care about them on that level.  Some have been kicked out.  Some have retired.  Yeah, whatever.  Walked away.  Whatever, because you get confused.  You know, you start getting a little popularity, so you're like,  all right, now that I'm popular, now they'll let me be a comedian on their show.  Now I want to change my character.  Well, you don't get to.  It's not to knock Twitchels.  I don't know what you do on stage.  Like you said, it might be really funny.  I don't know.  But you're in the game not that long, and you're really more well-known than you should 
[01:19:30]  be.  No reflection on your talent, considering how long you've been in the game.  Like, you've been doing comedy only a few years, and if you would have walked on the  stage in Worcester, almost all 6,000 of them would have known who you are.  And they would have all yelled, jump, jump, jump.  Yeah, exactly.  All knowing what gets you.  You wouldn't have gotten one joke out.  All right, you know what?  We'll throw him up on stage at the PNC.  If that's what he wants, we'll do that.  Oh, boy.  If that's what he wants, I will prove my point. 
[01:20:00]  That not only we don't give a crap about his comedy, our fans don't.  So I say this to Twitchels today.  That's a great invitation.  I say this to Twitchels.  You want time on that stage with all these great comedians?  You got it, pal.  You got it.  Buster.  You open the show.  Mm-hmm.  He might even be a good stand-up.  Well, let's see.  Twitchels, call the show right now.  I got an invite for you.  I got an invite for you.  Mm-hmm.  Can we call him in case he's not listening?  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  I think they're working on it.  By the way, before we go on to the story of him crying when he was supposed to be in the petting zoo.  Yeah.  And I guess that was insulting and below him.  I don't know.  But hold on.  But I'm so distracted by Nick in Atlanta.  Nick.  Hey, brother.  Hey, now don't show me.  I'm asking for maybe some style tips.  I was checking out those photos.  What's with the bell bottoms?  What jeans are those things we're wearing with the little?  It says on the line here, Nick, Atlanta, you guys all wear weird jeans. 
[01:21:00]  Who are you referring to?  Okay.  Now, don't.  Calm down, guys.  I'm asking him.  That's how he worded it.  I'm asking about the style of jeans.  Everyone was well.  Wear calm.  I had on, if you have to know, they are kind of like a bell bottom.  They were like Abercrombie and Fitch, which I bought in Vegas with Florentine three years ago.  And I was too fat to fit in them until recently.  And now I can wear them.  So that's what they were.  It's not bell bottoms.  It's like a boot cut.  Yeah.  Bought them in 1974.  I did.  It's on the way to the art of the topless. 
[01:21:30]  Why are you obsessed with our jeans?  Buck some bell bottoms showing off his ankles.  He chickened out.  He hung up.  Why?  Yeah.  I don't understand guys that are obsessed with what we wear.  With what we wear or do or the way we do our hair or the way we wear our shirts.  I buy jeans where everyone else buys jeans.  American Eagle, Abercrombie, go to the Gap.  I don't give a crap.  Although we can goof on Elo all we want.  Yeah.  His hair, shirt, pants. 
[01:22:00]  Of course we can.  Well, we got the shirt abuse.  Before we get out of here, we got to replay this.  But Bob Kelly had the true religion jeans and he was bragging about how he had true religion jeans on.  True religion?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  What the hell is that?  It's one of the hottest brands right now.  It is.  Ew.  And he knows that?  But it also costs you like $200 a pair.  Exactly.  Here's the thing with Bob Kelly.  He's the first one I saw wearing Von Dutch stuff.  He's a wannabe fruit.  You influenced idiot Von Dutch.  I like Von Dutch.  Yeah, do you?  Do you? 
[01:22:30]  Sorry.  Vivian Von Dutch.  That's right.  Buck some Bobby Kelly.  See him in his Von Dutch hat.  Dancing the seductive art of the topless.  Yeah, wear...  They call him the gorgeous gut.  Yeah, Bob.  Wear $200 jeans so no one notices that you've gained a lot of weight.  Because you can't handle the success of Torgasm.  You idiot.  Get Bob Kelly on the phone.  This fantastic fatty.  Frank the Frowner. 
[01:23:00]  Watch his mouth point downwards in the art of the topless.  But Bobby was bragging about his true religion jeans all night long.  And then, of course, Voss.  Yeah, true religion.  That's the type...  That's the jean you want.  What is Voss?  Stop.  Voss gave me some Sean John jeans I have to have taken up.  Hey, shrimp.  Stop buying pants.  Yeah, everything he has is tailored.  I know a tailor.  His child legs.  Stupid baby legs.  All right, back to Twitchell.  Scampering dumbly. 
[01:23:30]  Here's what I found out about Twitchell.  Kenny walks in and in true brilliant man fashion goes,  I did a bad thing.  Did you?  Did I have to shoot you by the river?  Yeah, Kenny's just...  So, that's the setup.  Twitchell was supposed to be in the petting zoo.  Supposed to be in the petting zoo with a bunch of other people.  And I think it bothers him that we wanted him for that and not for the state.  Yeah, I think that is the gist of the whole thing.  The genesis of the whole thing.  He didn't want to say it like that. 
[01:24:00]  He didn't want to put it like that.  So, he kind of turned it into a security issue.  Kenny, is that what I'm getting?  Well, I think the reality of the whole situation hit him and he got anxious.  Yeah.  Because I had two or three lovely conversations with Twitchell to set this thing up.  And by lovely, you mean completely annoying.  No, no, he was very enthusiastic, upbeat, you know, couldn't volunteer quick enough to do the petting zoo. 
[01:24:30]  You know, agreed, you know, knew what he was getting into.  Yeah.  Right?  I hooked him up with Pat Fuminaki.  They drive up together.  What a pair.  Wow, what a connection you made there.  They share a hotel room together.  Ooh, sexy.  You know, confirmed everything.  Like I said, I spoke to him two or three times.  He didn't mention one negative thing about anything.  But at the day of the show, right before showtime, I think he got a little anxious and maybe got a panic attack. 
[01:25:00]  You think?  Yeah, because all of a sudden, people are coming up to me like, Twitchells needs protection, Twitchells needs a laminate and not a VIP wristband, Twitchells this, Twitchells that.  And then I finally, Twitchells gets to me after, you know, a few people come up to me and Twitchells is like, he's worried about people punching him in the petting zoo because he's done these kind of events before.  He's done a petting zoo before?  No one has done a petting zoo. 
[01:25:30]  And who's going to punch him before with humans?  Yeah, and he needs, you know, he needs, and I'm telling, like, everything's going to be fine.  You know, you don't have to worry about nothing.  But no, I'm telling you because I've done these type of things before.  You know, I know.  Oh, boy.  So I go, Twitchells, look, not for nothing.  You know, I didn't say nothing like, who do you think you are or anything like that.  You know, I know maybe I'm not as diplomatic as I should be sometimes.  Way to phrase it.  Like I'm a little rough around the edges.  Yeah, I take the gold out of their teeth and separate their belongings. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  But I said, Twitchells, like, not for nothing.  You know, you're in the village in a petting zoo.  Let's put this in perspective.  Right.  You gave it a little perspective, and that's when you really, like, lost it.  You said, this is showbiz.  Yeah, I said, you're not on the main stage.  I says, when the Short Bus Comedy Tour can sell out this arena, then I'll be your road manager.  No, I'm hearing things because he said something like, Kenny came up to him and said, who the F do you think you are? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, that's not true.  Look, the guy's got enough problems.  Like, I would never, you know, like I said, I know I'm not, like, the most diplomatic guy, but I was quoted as saying that, and that's a total fallacy.  Yeah.  He's certainly not the most diplomatic guy.  I remember when I was touring with Dice years ago, and we were in Florida, and I hadn't met Kenny's family or Andrew's family.  And we were going to be in Vegas together, so Kenny, just to make sure, takes me to Room Malone and goes, you wouldn't hurt a child, would you? 
[01:27:00]  I'm like, what?  And Jimmy pointed out when he told me this on the way home from Boston, like, if I was going to hurt a child, would I actually admit that to you?  Admit it.  That's why I'm doing this.  Only to get access.  Why would you ask him that?  Nah, Andrew had small children.  I had small children.  We just met Jimmy.  Oh, you know he felt like six months.  Oh, my God.  I went to Dice with that one.  What a set.  I'm like, what's wrong with this guy?  Why would he ask me that?  He goes, ah, it's wrong. 
[01:27:30]  He shouldn't have said that to you.  Yeah.  It was all hurt.  Hey, really fast, Bill from Waterford, before we get back to the Twitchels thing, on the instant feedback,  can I point out that you called out the caller for caring about what you guys wear, then in the next breath, you called out Bob Kelly for wearing Von Dutch.  And true religion.  There you go.  I think we were more calling Bob Kelly on out, though.  Dude, is the fact that Bob is trying to be stylish.  Yeah, I couldn't tell you what it looked like.  Here's the difference.  I couldn't tell you what the hell Bob was wearing. 
[01:28:00]  I couldn't look.  I don't remember his pants, his shirt.  Nothing sticks out in my head.  The fact that it's designer stuff stuns me.  I want to throw warm tar on it.  I remember Bob killed on stage, and that's all I knew.  When I saw that Von Dutch hat about a year, whatever, two years, I wanted to take it off his head.  You know the bat that Kurt Russell used in Escape from New York with the nail in it?  That's how I wanted to remove that hat. 
[01:28:30]  Because then I saw a picture of Ashton Kutcher with the hat, and I go, oh, I see.  Yeah.  I threw up on him.  All right.  So let's get into it.  Let's speed this along here.  This isn't the first time I've had a little run-in with Twitchells, all right?  The first time was we went to Bill's Bar in Boston for opening day, and we had the velvet rope set up for the VIP area.  And every time I turned around, Twitchells was inviting people and bringing his entourage into the VIP area.  He's got an entourage.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  So I tell him once nicely.  I give him the benefit of the doubt.  The second time, I just throw him out.  All right.  So the petting zoo, he had a problem.  He didn't want to be in the petting zoo or whatever?  Well, no.  He just, I said, Twitchells, look, it's plain and simple.  If you feel uncomfortable, we're not going to force you to do something you don't want to do.  So where did it escalate to him crying and hating you?  Well, I just told him, look, if you don't want to be here, you don't have to be here, all right?  And then, you know, he snapped at me.  He's like, I don't need to be spoken to like that by you. 
[01:29:30]  And I'm like, fine.  Then, you know, you don't want to be here.  You can leave.  He did mention that, you know, he was on Leno and you haven't been.  Well, he didn't say that.  That's true.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Oh, yeah, he did.  What did he do on Leno?  He goes, when Kenny can say he was on Leno, he did like a stupid human trick.  What did he do?  He had like a wiffle ball bat in his fat because he lost a lot of weight.  And he hit a wiffle ball with the wiffle ball bat that was like attached to his gut.  When did he do that? 
[01:30:00]  Years ago.  I would love to see that.  Why would you mention that?  I don't know.  Another reason why you should not be on the main stage, by the way, unless you want to  do that trick.  I think 6,000 people would like to see you reenact that trick you did on Leno.  Can we get Louis Twitchell Santani on the phone?  Yeah, we're trying to get him on the phone.  I hope so.  So he ran off?  Well, no.  I told him, look, we're not going to make you do anything you don't want to do if you're  too uncomfortable.  Right.  We heard that three times, Kenny.  And then he goes, I'll think about it.  I was like, okay.  And I, you know, I left because I had like a lot of running around to do. 
[01:30:30]  And then the next thing, when I went to pick up Anthony, Anthony filled me in on the next  part of the story.  Okay.  That's what happened.  Thank you, Anthony.  So Anthony's at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in the lobby.  Well, Kenny told him he doesn't need to be if he doesn't want to be.  Oh, Kenny's the worst.  You should see the itineraries.  This is what it says.  Ken picks up Jim.  There, thanks.  Take to airport, park car.  Kenny starts park.  Open door. 
[01:31:00]  Lock door for safety.  All right.  Kenny.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Kenny kisses his family goodbye.  It's all written down for him.  He refers to himself in the third person.  It's me and him.  Instead of saying, pick up eight.  Ken picks up Jim.  Like, it's a little more casual.  So it's Ken picks up Jim.  Does he?  Kenny's terrific, but he's got some things going on that you notice when you hang out  with him more and more.  Psychopath.  Like, when we were driving to Boston and back from Boston, he has these directions in. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And he has his left thumb on the directions for the next turn that he needs to make.  And he refuses to let go of the paper until he makes that turn, the next part of the direction.  Then he can slide the thumb down.  And then he slides the thumb down.  And I'm like, let me just look at the paper.  I'll tell you where to go.  No, no, no, no.  He gets all freaked out.  He has this system in his head.  Noah didn't hold the arc directions as carefully as you hold.  And I said to him, all right, we have to go to what exit?  Like, exit 11.  I'm like, exit 27. 
[01:32:00]  Why are you still holding that?  Every exit, he'll glance down.  Oh, my God.  You are a kook.  Just in case it's changed.  I'm very organized.  That's organization.  Yeah.  Healthy.  Yeah.  It's organized.  All you have to go with it is just a lifetime of self-hatred and compartmentalizing.  All right.  Here we go.  We're going to take a break.  And then we'll continue with the Twitchell's crying story.  Yeah.  Because Anthony.  I had a run in.  Anthony was just in the lobby of the hotel.  Just wanted to leave to go to the venue.  That's all he wanted. 
[01:32:30]  And he runs into a hysterical, crying Twitchell's.  And then Twitchell's spent the whole night in his room, like, naked or something in a bed  because there's a creepy picture of him instead of being at the venue with us.  And he made $35 worth of phone calls from the room.  All right.  We'll get into all that next.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hi, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt.  Hey, folks.  My name is Henry Rowland.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong.  And you're listening to Pot Talk.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss. 
[01:33:00]  And you're listening to OPNN.  I love this.  Please refrain from the word.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it is.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  So you're in the lobby of the hotel getting ready for the O&A traveling virus. 
[01:33:30]  We got the set up.  Twitchell's now kind of running through the lobby.  Well, no, he was.  I was walking out.  He was walking in toward the elevators.  We meet in the hallway.  And he's his eyes are all red.  And he's starting to like starting to cry.  And he's telling me now conveying the story of Kenny.  But it includes things like Kenny saying, who the F do you think you are?  You know, you're not one of the comics and just really degrading him. 
[01:34:00]  And as he's saying it, dude, he's completely breaking down.  It's like, and Kenny tells me, and I can't do, you know, I got things to do.  And just loses it in a way where blubbering is really the only way to convey it.  Was he doing his Tourette's as he was crying?  Yeah, yeah, like not the noises, but the like, where his neck muscles really get tight and his head would go one way.  But completely weeping about this whole thing. 
[01:34:30]  That is the worst guy's prize in front of you.  And I'm now standing there.  I'm like, what the hell do you, what, what am I, why, why am I dealing with this?  Did you hug him?  No.  Are you crazy?  I am an insensitive ass.  I care about me and my girlfriend and certain family members. 
[01:35:00]  Period.  Thanks, man.  That's it.  That makes me feel really good today.  Thanks.  Yeah, me too.  Jeez, okay, a little care for Opie.  Jesus.  I dropped a tear once in a minute.  I care about you, I care about your health, I care about us as a radio show.  Can I be a selfish bastard?  Remember that time I cried, I dropped a tear and you wiped it away, the crook of your finger?  Yes, I just took my pointer finger knuckle and wiped the tear from your eye.  And then I held your chin between my thumb and forefinger.  That's right, and you spit my mouth. 
[01:35:30]  And I realized you didn't have one.  Yeah, you tried to hold my chin and your fingers met.  Just a little acknowledgement that I'm alive would be nice.  I don't want you to be asking how I am every day, but jeez.  All right.  Holy crap.  I don't care.  So he's crying.  You don't want to deal with it.  No, I don't want to deal with him.  Right.  We do not want to deal with any crying going on.  We got a show to do.  Like, you know, we're busy.  And now I got this crisis on my hands.  I can't just walk away from it. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know why.  I should have.  But I didn't.  And I told him, I said, look, here's what you do.  Go up to your room and calm the F down.  Relax.  Rent a movie.  Get something to eat and lay down and relax.  That was Anthony's advice because that means you were done with him.  Yeah, that's pretty much.  It was either that.  Go to your room.  Or talk to him for another half hour.  Yeah.  In the lobby as he's crying.  And I wanted to get to the venue and check things out and see things. 
[01:36:30]  And blubbering crying.  And that's how I left him.  He went back.  And then he's apologizing and thanking.  And I'm so sorry to be like this in front of you.  I don't want to be like this in front of you.  Ew.  Like, oh, God.  He's unstable.  And the picture they took, I guess, no filter.  Paul took the picture.  I'm not sure.  Apparently.  I can't look at it.  It's frightening.  But it's on all the websites.  We should get it up on opianthony.com.  But it's Twitchells with man boobs because he's like has no clothes on, I guess. 
[01:37:00]  And he's in his bed.  Used to be fat.  Just kind of staring at the camera like Private Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  He looks very unstable.  And that's the shot they got of him in the hotel instead of him being at the venue for the O&A Traveling Virus.  Gunnery Sergeant Kenny is going to get shot.  We paid his way and he did nothing, right?  Um, wow, really?  Is that what happened?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Okay, so he got a hotel room. 
[01:37:30]  Well, half one.  He shared it with Pat.  Hotel room.  And he made, he put $35 worth of phone calls on my tab.  And that's that, right?  That's the end of the story?  A babbling twister?  Yeah.  Crying and babbling.  Ended up not showing up.  He didn't even go down there to watch the show.  I know it's great.  We were talking about this on the way home from Boston, too.  He drove with Pat from Menachie.  So, you know, that was a very long ride for Pat from Menachie.  And Pat doesn't want to show any emotion ever.  Oh, no.  Of course.  That's why he eats a lot and has his, well, he doesn't want to get into anything serious. 
[01:38:00]  So, we were just imagining how awful that conversation was all the way back to Jersey.  Because, you know, Twitch was just opening his heart, you know, saying some things.  And Pat's like, if Pat wanted to show any kind of emotion, he would talk about the fact that his father lives maybe a mile away from him.  That's what I'm saying.  And he hasn't seen him in years, you know?  That's what I'm saying.  Pat has his own problems and doesn't want to dig into it whatsoever.  So, he doesn't want, you know, a blubbering, crying Tourette's comic, you know, sharing emotional times with him. 
[01:38:30]  Wouldn't you love to just see Pat lose it like that?  More than anything.  Just like, get off on the guy and go, hey, you know, but still in the Pat kind of way.  Right.  You know, like, hey, Twitchels, you know, why don't you go f*** yourself because I got my own f*** problems.  We got him on the line.  Pat.  Hey, guys.  See, listen to the clown on the outside.  Exactly.  Now, Pat, you had to drive with Twitchels. 
[01:39:00]  Yes, I did.  And share a room with him?  Yeah.  I think next time at PNC, with all due respect to Twitchels or Big A, I think I'll pay for my own single room.  Wow.  I need solitude.  Yeah.  You've got to get into character.  Wait, was he loud?  Was he sleeping?  Uh, no, it was like, uh, he was on the Twitchels reality show where you overact and he was singing in the shower and it was crazy. 
[01:39:30]  Twitchels reality show.  What do you mean he was overacting?  Well, first, when we got to the room, Paul and Denise were there and they must be the three loudest people on the planet.  Mm-hmm.  People were complaining within five minutes about the noise.  Yeah, they are very loud.  Excited or excited.  Yep.  Just happy to be there.  So he was overacting.  Was he, what was he, just happy to be there?  Is that what it was?  Uh, yeah, it was like a sort of a manic thing going on. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, and he let me know that he's used to, uh, rooming with comedians, so he might be naked at some point.  How's that quote?  Holy Jesus, hold the phone.  Are you kidding me?  He blames that on rooming with comedians?  Yeah, that's what it is.  We don't do that around each other.  No.  Although me and Levy did one time soil a television scent.  Doing a shower on video, but.  So, so wait, he said he might be naked and he was singing in the shower? 
[01:40:30]  Uh, yeah, well, he pretty much kept to himself in the shower.  I, I kind of let him know there's towels in the bathroom and you can use them.  So was he naked?  Uh, no, I didn't see anything.  And if he was naked, I kind of averted my eyes.  Pat, let's be honest.  You were scared to fall asleep with him in the room with you, right?  Yeah, Paul kind of suggested some things that I might be nervous about.  Did you just lay there and go, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, jeep, jeep, jeep.  Wait, what did Paul suggest?  I, I, well, Paul, those British people always use the word fag, so.  Yeah.  Maybe he was talking about smoking.  I don't know.  Hey, so, how was the write-up?  Was it pleasant at least and fun and, like, looking forward to the event?  Well, I just cracked my stereo and drove fast, so.  Pat didn't want to deal with him.  See, anything, no, it's not even that.  You're missing it.  He doesn't want to deal with anything serious ever. 
[01:41:30]  That's correct.  So, on the way up, you guys didn't talk all that much.  Yeah, just every once in a while in my peripheral vision, I'd catch a little twitch going on.  Yeah.  You know those long road trips.  You open up a little bit to the people in the car.  You can't help it.  You know, but Pat doesn't want to do any of that.  No, it's all about fun and laughter with Pat.  That's right.  Avoid him leaving.  He's never going to say, listen to the words.  And what they mean in this song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless it's Bobby McFerrin. 
[01:42:00]  When?  So, what happened?  When did you realize there was a problem?  Well, I was standing right there when Kenny had his little talk.  I'm doing the quotes with my fingers.  Talk with Twitchell.  He never said, who do you think you are?  Well, he just explained that he is not for the big stage.  He's for the petting zoo.  Kenny's very professional.  And he'll tell you what you don't want to hear at times.  He's not going to sit there wasting time beating around the bush. 
[01:42:30]  No.  He'll tell you what it is.  And that's it.  So, what happened in the room?  What happened on the way home?  Did Twitchell want the big stage, Pat?  You know, he never expressly said that.  But he kept saying stuff like, I've been in show business since I was seven.  He was just at a, he had an extra part in a movie the night before.  And he was up all night the night before because he called me at 12.30 a.m.  And then again at 2.30 a.m. when I was trying to get some sleep for the long ride I had the next day. 
[01:43:00]  See, he's been in show business since seven.  But you know what?  Twitchell's is all about twitching, slapping his face, and jumping when we say jump.  Yeah, I said that.  He's never been bigger because of that.  You're on the show.  And he has to.  You're on the show for being a comedian.  You're there for.  Right, exactly.  And he has to realize that.  Or his days on the opening Anthony show are done.  Yeah, it's not, again, a knock on his thing.  But if you got that going and you're billing yourself as a comic with Tourette's, then don't  be mad when we exploit it when you bill yourself as that. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  That's what got you in the door.  There's a million, and again, there's a lot of good comedians, man.  Not a million, but there's a lot of good ones that could be here doing funny stuff.  You've got to keep in mind, he's not even 21 yet.  Yeah, he's young.  I understand.  And he smoked a little 420 just before the show.  Yeah, that's what he was telling me, too, in the hallway as he was weeping.  He goes, I just need some pot.  I just need some pot.  And then I just heard that he had been smoking the whole time.  I think he got anxious. 
[01:44:00]  He got a panic attack.  He got anxiety.  Yeah, I think that was it.  So you saw the talking to, was Twitchell's being a little unreasonable?  Excuse me?  You saw Kenny's talking to with Twitchell's.  Was Twitchell's being a little bit unreasonable?  A little bit.  Well, I saw him asking Paul about the, because we just had the blue wristbands, and he was  saying, no, I heard we get the VIP tags.  And then I wasn't sure if he asked Kenny about that.  Right, right.  But it probably got back to Kenny about that. 
[01:44:30]  And then he had some weird concern about somebody beating him up in the petting zoo.  I said, I was a bouncer.  There's a production manager that was supposed to...  And no one was going to beat anybody up in the petting zoo.  No, he's unstable.  So how was the ride home there, Pat?  The long ride home.  I made the music a little louder and drove a little faster.  Was he trying to get into conversation with you about it?  No, he just said, I think I need a break from the show.  Oh, he's got it.  We don't care. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, I told him.  I didn't think that was going to be a problem at that point.  There's people waiting in the wings to take his place.  Who cares?  Yeah.  So.  All right.  How was he that night in the room when you got back?  It was completely dark when I got in.  The lights were completely out, and he was under the sheets.  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah.  Rented some porno and just, ugh.  Was he awake?  Charged it to the room.  No.  No.  He was, uh, jeep, jeep, jeep, twitch. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  You ever see the movie, Casualties of War?  No, but I'd love to talk to you about it sometime once I do.  No.  When the new guy's running along the road asking a bunch of stupid questions, and he  ends up stepping on a landmine.  That's like every war movie, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What did you say when he said, I may need a break from this show for a while?  I said, that might be a good idea.  Oh, daddy. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  Daddy.  See, Pat is all about fun until he pulls up, gets into that trailer by the airport, and  that door shuts.  Then, when he's alone with himself.  I have a table, my animals, and a big bowl of some kind of food.  When he's alone with his thoughts, it's not good.  Do you have roaches, Pat?  Do I have what?  Bugs?  No.  Okay.  No.  All right, Pat.  Bye.  The cats keep them away.  You had a good time, though, with the O&A traveling virus? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  But before the petting zoo, I was out in front by the dunking clown.  Yeah.  Hacko the clown.  Hacko the clown.  He goes, hey, fat guy in the black shirt.  And about two of us fat guys in black shirts were looking at each other going, what does  he mean?  Yeah.  Which guy does he mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, more rolls than a bakery.  You would have narrowed them down to 100.  More rolls than a bakery.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:47:00]  23 skidoo.  That line was a lot funnier when you posted it on the message board and said it was 100  guys in black shirts wondering which guy he was talking to.  Yeah, why did you say two?  Damn, I got to work on my number.  Takes away from the whole joke.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  So for another gentleman.  All right.  Time for a plug.  Steve S. from Bayshore says, Twitchels, what does he think he is?  Julius Seizure?  Time for a plug.  Do you want to go see the O&A Traveling Virus at the PNC Bank Arts Center on August 26th? 
[01:47:30]  Yes, I do.  All right.  Text the word Ramone to 69923.  The 90-second text message wins a pair of tickets to the comedy event of 2006.  Text now Ramone, R-A-M-O-N-E, by the way, to 69923.  Brought to you by Bud Light, and you'll get a pair of tickets, okay?  Right.  When we get back, Molly grows up.  What is that?  That's all I'm going to say.  Molly grows up.  Exciting.  And we've got to replay the Elo shirt abuse. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  Actually, we might have time to play it before the break.  You want to do that?  You want to explain this really fast?  Elo is our boss on XM Satellite Radio, and he's also on PalTalk, which is our video conferencing  we do with our listeners on a daily basis.  We have cameras here.  They have cameras at home or in their offices.  We look at them.  And they look at us doing the show.  They could hear also some behind-the-scenes stuff.  When we go into commercial break, we leave the mics on so they could watch us and hear us. 
[01:48:30]  Elo is also on camera.  And people can see the shirt he was wearing.  And when he was in the studio, though, at XM...  He was the one that brought Whoopi by.  Yeah, he brought Whoopi by.  In that shirt, yeah.  In that shirt.  In this awful shirt.  And we just...  We had to goof on his shirt because it was just horrid.  It was one of those shirts with a tiny...  Like, a tiny checker pattern, I guess, is the best way to explain it.  Picnic table...  Tablecloth.  Purple and white.  Bright purple and white.  Just weird colors that made your eyes hurt. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  It was just wrong on so many levels.  Yeah.  And everyone could see it that was on PalTalk, so they knew what we were talking about.  And it was just a horrific shirt.  It really was awful.  Purple.  The abuse flew.  Listen in.  Elo, don't think it's going to be like Whoopi, and you sit down and everything gets nice.  Your shirt sucks.  I don't agree.  I think that it's a jubilee for the eyes.  Your shirt looks like a shirt.  Your shirt looks like it must look like when you're having a stroke.  Holy s***. 
[01:49:30]  I see picnic tables.  I'm going to die.  Kids are falling down, having epileptic fits when you walk down the sidewalk.  It's an eye church.  That's what you see when you're looking at the grimace and you get a concussion.  What's those things people do now?  Suko?  Saduko.  Saduko.  Take you and your saduko.  Really?  He's a fag crossword puzzle.  Four-letter word for something to avoid in our community.  I have an A. 
[01:50:00]  That shirt looks like a Puerto Rican Elvis picture.  You're moving and there's another picture.  You know what?  I see a Tyrannosaurus.  Just stare at it.  You'll see the boat.  You guys have to adjust.  Look past his shirt.  That shirt's a colorblind exam.  If you look really close, you see like a green sea.  If you spin in circles, we'll all remember s*** my childhood.  I didn't remember that being so hurtful, so my apologies to Eric Lover. 
[01:50:30]  So hurtful.  Oh, it continued.  That shirt should come with a whoo, whoo, whoo.  Oh, you're a Mondo Topless shirt.  But I get on CBS and get the apology tomorrow.  That shirt came with free pasta.  Hey, Ron Popeil's shirt.  You still look like you had the white spaghetti sauce off of that shirt.  Your shirt doesn't look like a shirt of a late waiter.  Oh, sorry I'm late, pal. 
[01:51:00]  Let me wipe my hands off.  The shirt looks like what McCluskey pulled off the table after he got it in the head.  I don't want my father's barber.  McCluskey got it in the head on your shirt.  He was wearing a yellow shirt around his neck.  How's the Italian food in this place?  Nice shirt, Lou.  God damn.  I was up here on the DL, dude. 
[01:51:30]  I flew in.  Nobody knew I was here.  Here's Elo when he finally looks at his shirt.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  I didn't buy it.  I'll just go on record.  I didn't buy the shirt.  On record.  Much like money, the clothes that you wear.  Oh, I know.  I never realized how much fun it is, though.  Well, no, you didn't buy that.  Who did buy that?  Lance Bass?  It's like punch sound, woman scream, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:52:00]  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the phone, Bob Saget.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie virus spreading across America.  Bob, what's going on, buddy?  Not much.  You can't take antibiotics for a virus, can you? 
[01:52:30]  Not for this one, no.  No.  It just goes in through the colon, I assume, right?  Yeah.  Antibiotics only make it stronger.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Hey, you killed in Worcester, bro.  That was so much fun, guys.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, there's a bootleg video of you doing part of your act.  Great.  Bootleg.  Up on YouTube.  You talking dirty about Full House and stuff.  Ah, crap.  They're not supposed to do that.  Now I've got to sue some poor kid.  Poor thing.  House and punch him in the face. 
[01:53:00]  Just thought I'd let you know.  It's up there.  It's getting hit like crazy.  People are checking it out.  It's a nice little commercial for the ONA traveling virus.  A lot of the language is a little salty, Bob.  Sure is.  I am.  I'm a salty dog.  That's what I like to put on a bun every now and then.  People loved.  I convinced girls I'm a street vendor.  People loved it.  And then when you brought the guitar out, people think like, oh, no.  Uh-oh.  It's a guitar.  I'm a little scared.  Right.  But your songs were despicable. 
[01:53:30]  Thank you.  That's a Daffy Duck critique.  Yes.  It's despicable.  Right.  But I don't know.  I've been playing for a long time.  I'm not very good, but at least I can say some nasty stuff.  Oh, you get the point across.  That's for sure.  Well, I can carry the Tourette's tune.  I didn't see any of the act.  I just heard the laughs.  It was really, really massively well-received.  Well, thank you.  You know, it doesn't really matter what happened as long as we got through it all.  And your Andrew Dice Gay was beautiful.  Thank you, Bob. 
[01:54:00]  Seriously.  I'm going to be studying more tapes of Dice, I think.  I'll study more tapes.  Maybe get some opinions from Club Soda Kenny, who spent so many years with the man, the legend himself.  And now he's stuck with us.  You don't even have to do the duct tape hamster material.  No, of course not.  It's not necessary.  Or Kenny.  This is just like touring with Dice, isn't it, Kenny?  Back in the heyday?  Right.  Oh, I've known the guy a really long time. 
[01:54:30]  Who knew that he was just a sweet Jewish kid from New York?  Yeah.  Then he met Mel Gibson.  When are you coming into town again?  I'm coming there.  Well, my daughter's going to school there.  Well, at least I say she's my daughter.  Well, I'm coming into town to do some, because I'm doing this NBC show all of a sudden.  I was supposed to be in Chicago this week, and I have to go next week, because there's  some new improv.  It's like one of the last clubs I'm doing, because I'm blowing up with you guys, you know?  Ooh.  Oh, you're definitely a hit. 
[01:55:00]  Wait, why did you say you and I were doing something in Vegas together?  Yeah, I just meant a woman.  Oh.  Yeah, I just meant we'd do something.  Okay.  We couldn't tell what the gender was.  All right.  That's a fact, bro.  That's what I meant.  It could be a she-male or a donkey, half-donkey, half-kid.  Dare to dream.  All acceptable.  It's all fine.  But I'm doing this NBC show, which I was at first reluctant to do, because it is a game  show.  I call it a quiz show.  Quiz show.  That's nice.  Sounds good.  Sounds like there's going to be some kind of extortion, doesn't it?  Yeah, 1950s. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with $64,000 that you're not allowed to give out.  But it's an hour show.  It's going to be on every night on NBC for an hour after they start Sunday Night Football.  And they said, ad-lib, do what you do.  I said, guys, I don't know if you know what I do.  Uh-oh.  So there's going to be, somebody's going to get in trouble.  Oh, boy.  There's going to be problems.  Well, it's edited.  They do edit it.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's...  I hope I don't say, like, shmegma on the air.  That's safe.  It's good to know that you go through the same... 
[01:56:00]  Well, I'm...  This is so stupid how I'm presenting this, but we've done TV meetings over the years, and  no one has a concept for an Opie and Anthony show, and we meet with these people.  And we're like, and you guys will just go out there and do what you do.  Well...  How about you give us a little something else to work with?  You play a banjo with your anus bob, that kind of thing.  Well, suggest something.  How's that?  Yeah, come up.  How about you do some of the lifting?  Pitch this.  Mm-hmm.  Actually, I don't know.  They want me to do it, and I don't know. 
[01:56:30]  You know, because I do that video show, but I'm not that guy anymore.  I was just going to say that.  Why don't you just play videos?  That seemed to work.  Right.  I could hit myself in the nuts for an hour.  Hey, Bob, we got to cut this one short, because we got to get to Molly Grows Up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you guys just started in Chicago, right?  We're on in Chicago, yes.  I'm there a week after next at this new giant improv.  It's supposed to be bigger than a Toys R Us.  There's an improv in Chicago?  Yeah, they just started it.  It's like 500 seats, and it's nice. 
[01:57:00]  But, you know, I'm doing that, like, next week, because I had to move it.  Okay.  All right.  To you, the 26th is what?  Is Holmedale, right?  Yeah.  We can't wait.  Tickets are selling just great for that show.  Cakes.  And then the other one is the 9th.  I'm in Camden with you guys.  Tweeter Center.  Tweeter Center, yes.  The O&A Traveling Virus presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.  Thanks a lot for the other night.  It was a lot of fun, and so was the show.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun.  Thanks so much, Bob.  Bye, Angel.  Thank you. 
[01:57:30]  See you soon.  Thank you.  All right.  Bob Saget, everyone.  Buck some Bob Saget.  That's right.  We had to cut him off, because we've got to get to this Molly Grows Up.  We tease too many things on the show, and we never get to them.  How to Eat a Watermelon, we'll do that on the XM show today, I promise.  But Molly Grows Up, it's one of these educational films from the old days.  We love these things.  We get these from time to time.  Hold on.  Just a quick message from No Filter Paul about the Twitchells thing.  Yeah.  Twitchells won't call in. 
[01:58:00]  He was still crying all day yesterday, saying he had a career before O&A.  Bye.  And you guys are making his Tourette's worse since he's been on.  Okay.  All right.  Apparently, he was going to kill himself at one point.  You should try to get his agent on XM later, and then there's a phone number and his name.  All right.  You know what?  Come on.  Don't come on.  Whatever, dude.  I mean, you got to do what you got to do.  You're not going to blackmail the show.  Don't get to kill yourself.  Stop.  Kill yourself.  Why?  He's unstable.  We got to let him go. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  We're all unstable.  That's why we do this, Twitchells.  Of course.  We're all disasters.  We'd be working like real work.  We all show our...  He's traveling with an ex-cop.  He has a gun and OCD.  He won't let go of the goddamn directions when he drives.  Speaking of homoerotic, no offense, Steve.  We all show our underbellies.  Wow. 
[01:59:00]  Exactly.  We're all a mess.  Ope's got OCD answered.  Look, whether you're saying that you're an antisocial germaphobe.  I got problems, but as far as the OCD thing, I laugh at that now after hanging out with  you, and especially you, Kenny.  I don't have him as bad as you guys at all.  Club Soda Kenny is ridiculous.  He is awful.  Ridiculous.  I had to shoot him four times because it's an even number.  So true.  Exactly.  The three laughing at that. 
[01:59:30]  Kenny, Keith, and Mike.  You know when my basement exploded?  Kenny was helping me out as far as that goes.  And the landlord got a cleaning clue.  A cleaning clue.  A cleaning crew.  A cleaning clue.  But it wasn't going to arrive until the next day, and Kenny was so obsessed that he showed  up in my apartment the next day with a broom, a mop, and a pail.  He was obsessed.  He needed it cleaned immediately, even though it had nothing to do with him.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  But something in his head started clicking.  You're not still sleeping there, are you?  Just upstairs from time to time.  Oh, my God.  And what are you saying?  And what are you saying today?  What?  About your throat.  What are you doing in that place?  Why are you doing that?  About your throat in your head.  No, the throat is from the door.  Shut up.  I'm not.  I didn't get an invite from any of you guys.  That was real.  Dude.  I got to do what I got to do.  Go after yourselves.  What?  You're sleeping in the mold.  Now you're going to show that you care about me?  Go fuck yourself.  Jesus.  I'm fine.  Okay. 
[02:00:30]  Good.  Sleep in the mold.  And I was only thinking of you.  Just suggesting.  Roll around in it.  Now you're going to act like you care about me?  Go screw it.  I'm saying that.  I got a sore throat.  And I hope it's from the black mold.  How's that?  Okay.  I was just saying.  And I hope I can't talk in the show ever again.  Why?  Sleep in the basement.  Why even go upstairs?  I was hurt that you don't even think about me.  I do.  From earlier?  I've asked you 500 times where you stay in.  Holy Jesus.  You're in a hotel.  You stay in a hotel.  You're back in the mold.  I've been in hotels. 
[02:01:00]  I've been.  Trust me.  I'm fine.  All right.  I'm fine.  It's a pain in the ass.  I'm getting out soon.  I care.  I don't care.  Kenny cares too much.  That's the problem.  I just want someone in between, maybe, Kenny and Anthony.  Something.  Oh, yeah.  Jim Norton.  I can't.  You're my perfect friend.  I asked you, are you staying?  Why are you there?  There's mold.  Ant doesn't give a crap if I live or die.  That stuff is a good one.  Oh, my God.  Freaking Kenny is, like, literally a day away from stalking me full time. 
[02:01:30]  Kenny's a nudge.  Wow.  All right.  It's all coming out today.  Yeah, tell us how you really feel.  What?  All right.  Can we get to Molly?  Molly grows up, please?  Are you a high school girl?  That was awful.  Oh, my God.  It's an A&B conversation.  Should I see my way out of it?  You guys want to hear about Molly growing up or what?  I want to know what that is. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  It's one of these educational films.  Opie is having a Twitchell's moment.  This is Opie Twitchell's Hughes.  I'm not having a meltdown.  I'm just effing around.  All right.  I, too, don't give a crap about anybody.  There you go.  No, the problem is I care too much.  But people don't realize that.  All right.  Molly grows up.  I care too much.  I care.  Here's Molly. 
[02:02:30]  Let's just get into it.  Self-explanatory.  Is that you, Molly?  Yes, Mom.  Hi.  What kind of a day did you have today?  Mom, guess what?  I don't know.  What?  Mom, I started my first period.  Ooh.  Well, what do you know?  Come on, sit down.  Tell me about it.  Just not on that.  Tell me about it.  Tell me about it. 
[02:03:00]  It's funny.  This is a historic day in little Molly's life.  Get away from the base sofa.  Get over there on the linoleum.  Dirty girl.  Yeah, the whole room smells like pennies.  Time to go sleep in the bathtub.  Oh, my God.  It looks like someone's been dropping cranberries all over the house.  Jason from Rye.  Here's your problem, Ope.  You stay with Jimmy, you get to play Monster Rain. 
[02:03:30]  You stay with Ant, you get to play Hide the Nazi Helmet.  Back to Molly grows up.  Come on, sit down.  Tell me about it.  Tell me about it.  When did it start?  Well, it was this afternoon when I was changing into my gym clothes, and I noticed a bit of  on my panties.  Well, I sneezed, and it looked like a paintball accident. 
[02:04:00]  Poor little Molly.  No, no, sit on the red chair.  Kevin from Connecticut.  What's that on the wall?  Looks like somebody hit a tomato with a baseball bat.  People are trying to start problems here.  Captain Planet from Blender, whatever that means.  Is there some reason Bob gets rushed off the show every time he calls in now?  No, we just had things to do.  We like Bob a lot, but he calls in because he's in L.A.  Stupid.  He calls in at like 8.35 because of the time difference, and we're leaving soon. 
[02:04:30]  That's why he's rushed off the show, because we had a bit to get to.  Yes.  Dope.  Molly.  He understands.  There are times he's on for a half hour, and sometimes he's on for five minutes.  That's all.  So whoever just said that, die.  I noticed a bit of on my panties, and golly, at first I thought, well, I didn't know what  to think.  And now I remembered when we talked about menstruation.  Menstruation.  Menstruation and stuff, and, well, then I went to see Miss Jensen.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:05:00]  What?  How do you feel?  Mm, kind of funny-like.  I mean, well, I was hoping it would start soon, but it seems like I've forgotten everything  you've told me.  All right.  I'll tell you what we'll do.  Tonight will be mother and daughter conference night.  And if you'll give me a hand with supper, we'll get started that much early.  Okay, I'll wash that.  Tomato soup.  I'll get the pasta.  I'll make the sauce.  I'm sure you will.  Now, remember, Mama said, don't put on your good humor outfit and do cartwheels. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, man, it's updating.  I can't read the guy's name.  He's from Jersey.  Opie just got done with his period, and Molly just started hers.  Give me a hand with supper.  We'll get started that much early.  Okay, I'll wash up and be right down.  Please.  Let's just squat over the sprinkler. 
[02:06:00]  Golly.  It's going to go dip in the sink.  Golly.  Golly, gee.  Why did every mother back then look old?  Yeah.  Certainly didn't look...  She had that look.  Certainly didn't look effable.  No.  At all.  It's the husband we get home and just punch them in the face for being a woman.  Where's Kenner?  Uh, well, here we go.  Phone rings, explains to friends she can't go swimming because she has the curse.  Oh, the curse.  I'll get it.  That's probably Peggy. 
[02:06:30]  Peggy.  Peggy.  Hello?  Oh, hi, Peggy.  Sure, just a minute.  I'll ask.  Mom, can I go swimming with Peggy tomorrow after school?  I don't think I would, Molly.  Sorry, but I'd be home after school.  It'll look like somebody was laying chum in the pool.  Sharks will be taking taxis over to the pool.  So a friend of mine, Molly, went over to her. 
[02:07:00]  I tapped her on the shoulder.  She bobbed up like a top.  She had been bitten in half at the waist.  Or at least it looked like she had.  But I realized she just had the curse.  I have a curse.  This could be the line of the day.  Kevin from Connecticut.  She has a Molly.  That's it.  That would have been good about ten seconds ago. 
[02:07:30]  It happens.  Why don't you play Footloose?  Got to, got to, got to.  Wow.  All right.  Just showing he has skills.  That's good.  He certainly does.  Either that or a faggot's iPod.  All right, let's go back to Molly.  Trying to talk her mom into letting her go swimming at her friend's house.  Peggy tomorrow after school? 
[02:08:00]  I don't think I would, Molly.  But I'd be home by 5.30.  That's great.  That's not the problem.  It's not the time, Molly.  He wants you to wake up.  They don't want you making Kool-Aid in their pool.  It's going to look like someone threw Kool-Aid and lima beans skin in their...  Oh, boy.  We'll take bets to see if that made it through.  Yeah, we'll see.  I guarantee it would have.  Sure. 
[02:08:30]  I hope so.  Guaranteed.  Home by 5.30.  No, it's not a good idea the first two or three days of your period.  You might get chilled and catch Kool.  What?  Oh, that's right.  Peggy, of course I can't go swimming.  You know I've got the curse.  That's right.  It isn't a good idea the first couple of days.  Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Ew.  I don't want you in the pool anyway.  Molly just barks it out like she knew it all along.  Like, stupid Peggy should have known.  You know. 
[02:09:00]  I have the curse.  Yeah.  The curse.  You're going to invite me.  Well, that's why we cut Bob Saget short.  Yeah.  And we only got through a couple of the clips.  Can we talk about them tomorrow?  Yeah, we'll talk about it.  We'll keep this for this side of the show.  We'll do this tomorrow.  Hello, Tucson.  Hi, Tucson.  Yeah, Tucson.  What's wrong with Tucson?  I don't know if I'm sure it's true.  I love Arizona.  There's a mistress in Tucson.  I want to see it.  Yeah?  Deception. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, what's up, man?  You've been on hold for, I would say, an hour to an hour and a half.  Wow.  Yeah.  No, man.  It was hitting me the Mondo Topless.  Mondo Topless.  Menstruating Molly.  All right.  Not bad.  Marvelous menstruating Molly.  Watch her swim the light, seductive dance of the chum lair.  Thanks, guys.  You rock.  All right.  That's all you want to do is say hi.  Deception.  Deception. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  We're out of here.  We'll continue on XM.  If you're not joining us, that's fine.  We'll see you tomorrow for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes.  Join us.  Thanks for checking us out, man.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The one virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment. 
[02:10:30]  That is such a long way to go just to say ****.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, it's the, uh, ha, ha. 
[02:11:00]  It's the Opie.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hello, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha.  The Opioid Enemy XM walkover begins now.  Yeah, Molly's a bloody mess.  God, that was...  I was a little nervous about what was going to get through over there. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  I wanted to try this line, but I didn't know if it would work.  All right.  Molly's cunt should be traveling behind a Simmons freeway sign.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Molly has the curse.  I saw you trip on your heel.  Any fucking lid, keep fluid in.  First of all, Starbucks should be firebombed for those awful coffee lids.  They just drip coffee on your finger.  It's enraging. 
[02:12:00]  Is it?  Drip, drip on my fucking finger.  I've ruined so many shirts with the Starbucks coffee just dripping on your nice shirt.  They suck those lids.  As you're trying to enjoy a nice cup of coffee.  Well, we love Starbucks.  I like the coffee.  That mom-and-pop coffee place is stink.  Your coffee's always stale.  You like the whole thing where it's all over the country.  They get the same cup of coffee no matter where you are.  Yep.  Who is the Dallas Cowboy that looks like this guy that we see every day? 
[02:12:30]  The mascot.  Yeah, but an old school cowboy used to wear a hat like that when he wasn't playing.  Oh, I'm thinking of the Dallas Cowboy mascot as a guy, a black guy who runs around in a cowboy hat who does look like that guy.  All right.  That must be it.  Yeah, he's got a mustache.  All right, it's been driving me nuts.  Cowboy Ray.  But he does look like him, right?  That's who you're probably thinking of.  All right, there you go.  He's got two tall Joneses.  He's being knocked down in the boxing ring.  Or B.B. King or...  Yeah, that was a good move by him.  Start a second career in boxing.  Yeah, that was smart. 
[02:13:00]  Hello, sir.  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  How are you playing?  Good.  Every day with the photos with this guy.  I like it.  He's a big fan.  Jesus.  Nice creases, faggot.  I did have nicely creased pants.  It's like the shape of this fucking head.  It's like an old queen or something.  Of course he was.  All right.  It's going to be a short walk today.  Yeah.  What's going on?  It's like a damn look convention.  Oh. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, what the hell's going on here?  I don't know.  It's some kind of a meteor.  Jesus.  They look like they're in the motion picture business.  It should be a dateline camera.  You guys are up here.  Hi.  How are you going?  Hey.  We were just talking about the Starbucks lids.  Do you find that you get a lot of drip with those lids, like it comes out all over you?  Yeah.  It's awful, right?  What are you guys doing?  We're a radio show.  Oh, cool.  Groovy.  But we drink Starbucks.  Groovy.  It gets all over because this is stupid.  Yeah, that can happen.  So what do you do to stop that? 
[02:14:00]  I don't know.  Okay.  Wrap it in a napkin.  How about getting raped?  Would that help?  Look at her.  She can't walk fast.  She is running away, man.  She's doing the fastest walk ever.  It's not like we said so.  Did Molly's fucking cunt drip in your hot water and make some vampire tea?  I think at this point we've got to announce that Mac is dead because we haven't seen him.  Is it official?  Are we going to officially announce his death?  I think he might be dead. 
[02:14:30]  Haven't seen him in quite some time.  Hey, look around the back of that bus.  Hey, look at that.  Eh, wonderful.  I can't wait for the TV commercial.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Won't be long?  When?  I don't know.  I think the final mix is happening.  We're going to fuck things up.  All right, let's walk.  Start getting some of those corporate people involved in creative stuff.  Goes to shit.  Absolutely.  All right, some suited gentlemen. 
[02:15:00]  Get out of my way.  Not much going on on the walk today, as you can hear.  No, very subdued day in the city.  I don't know why.  Hey, Sam, go over there and grab Kim Jong-il.  I want to talk to him.  That's a fucking tiny dictator.  Look at this fez look-alike.  What the hell is this?  He looks like retarded Burt Reynolds.  See the other guy with his spiked hair? 
[02:15:30]  I get it.  You're cool.  Run, Forrest, run!  Sweaty mess.  I like that.  Oh, black eye.  What happened?  What'd you do wrong?  What happened?  The girl had a black eye.  Oh, did she?  What did someone tell you to do that you didn't?  She was Hispanic.  What game were you talking during?  Any new billboards today?  We've talked about all this crap, right?  Viva Pedro.  Christina Aguilera.  Back to basics. 
[02:16:00]  New CD.  Snow Patrol.  Nice.  Chasing cars.  Iron Maiden.  I like the Snow Patrol.  And what is, uh...  What is that?  What is that?  The Wu-Tang Saga continues.  Master Killer.  Master Killer.  Made in Brooklyn.  Featuring the entire Wu-Tang Clan.  Black people don't like the letter R.  I don't know why. 
[02:16:30]  On the end of their words.  It's like they'd rather put an A  and then take out, like, the E-R.  They take out the R's.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  I don't like the three R's.  Let's go.  Than, you want to play a little piano?  Oh, and, uh, Steinway?  He's not getting out of that, by the way.  He's already...  No.  He's already trying to downplay, like,  oh, I don't know.  We got to get a keyboard in soon  so Than can play. 
[02:17:00]  Right inside.  Thanks, uh, to the two people  that joined us today.  That was a nice little, uh, walk.  That was wonderful.  It makes us feel so good about ourselves  when you see two, three people show up.  That was a stroll.  Well, we had a nice crowd yesterday.  Yeah.  It's one of those things.  It's a crapshoot, as they call it.  We need to sponsor the walkover,  and we need to give out free stuff.  Free stuff means more people for the walkover.  That's true.  They are a bunch of greedy bastards.  All right.  Uh,  might be crapping out early today,

[02:20:30]  they didn't mean it oh it's what you say we all do it but you don't mean it i don't even offer i  don't think i had no place i didn't even offer you say stuff uh to people that are in duress  and you don't mean it i said get a hotel that was my advice you should be a hotel that's good advice  in that factope then uh you're the best then and people do it all the time i mean you can call in 
[02:21:00]  right now uh you know not to bring up a bad subject but i went through a really tough time  two years ago when my dad died every single person that i know said hey man i'll you know  whatever you need just let me know that's the type of thing and and you know people do mean well  don't get me wrong they do mean well but that's just the type of thing you you say if there's  anything i can do uh don't call me that's what they mean people don't know what to say though  like you just don't know what to say like you want to help the person you really want out if you 
[02:21:30]  really want to help someone out you actually just help them out you know what i mean that's what you  do but people say this type of thing all the time i've been thinking about this for a while people  say stuff like hey anything you need man i'm here for you can i make a comment what does that really  mean yes kenny i'd like to say in my time in need when i lost my job the opie and anthony show  stepped up and employed me oh so but see we could have just said kenny anything you need  exactly but what i guess what i'm trying to get at instead of saying that horse shit you actually 
[02:22:00]  do something right you're the real deal you do something for the person you know what i mean  tips for drinking starbucks kevin in san francisco what's up hey boy this segment to whoop and i know  just hold on i know i just insulted a lot of people by saying that because i have a lot of  family and friends that listen to the show and you know you know losing my dad two years ago the way  i did it was it was a really really tough time and stuff and people you know meant well without a 
[02:22:30]  doubt i would never question that but it's it's that you say stuff like that just because it's the  thing to say soap is basically saying that take your good intentions and cram up your ass absolutely  about some fucking substance absolutely i think we all do it i'm not saying i'm i'm you know special  well i am special get it in other ways but get a pen write this down actions speak louder than words  i don't know if that's gonna stick i think it might it's got something catchy to it

[02:23:30]  that proves our point we were trying to make earlier yeah now if kenny did that it would  wreck the whole joke they would have had to dump out like i said uh i want our nuts good to eat  and and aunt would say something like um for you they might be yeah and kenny would lean in and go  because there's a cock next to him cock nuts balls but are nuts okay like uh if i want to eat like  almonds like uh almonds are very good for you i know no i know i know i know but i'm saying  to a tree maybe uh but how about uh i want some raw almonds but i'd rather have smokehouse nuts

[02:27:30]  of the park the difference is a little canoe people are trying to get the ball but i was naked out there  with a little net but if i just stood in the shower naked the way it works is it would have gotten a  weird laugh but it wouldn't have worked like that because it's all a bit me i'm just  fucking yet no i know to be honest when i was uh kind of when i was writing that bit  no i i knew we needed an ending i knew there was something missing trust me and you uh came up with 
[02:28:00]  the perfect ending i'm just fucking around actually john what's up well it's a team effort boys um so  when jimmy said the kool-aid and lima bean uh bit um excuse me excuse me excuse me i'm not  fucking around with you john i said the kool-aid line hope had a punchline and i tagged it it's  called a tag there's no me and team oh yeah there certainly is there is no mon team there's no  there's no i in uh there's no i in cocksucker get to it fella uh go ahead john all right well

[02:29:30]  from getting up can i jump i don't consider this okay you said what i was gonna say yeah we're we  know we don't work this isn't a job to me i worked very hard actually many many years of my life and  actually uh you know um to tear down one of the radio uh walls which one that's one of the things  they teach you when you get into this business no one out there wants to hear that you're working  working oh man what a hard day we had because they're going to real jobs yeah let me tell you i'm 
[02:30:00]  disagree with all that do you know the pressure we have on a daily basis to know that there's a  million or so or two million people listening to you and you have to be interesting and then i think  what am i gonna do with all of my accolades  no another thing they taught me in uh in the good old uh world of radio they actually back in the day  wanted you as a jock to uh put up a picture of the typical listener i remember this one so i uh 
[02:30:30]  and it was it was an exercise right this was back at wcmf in rochester the the home of brother we's  what no that guy doesn't fit the bill no black gentleman mustachioed gentleman and they actually  it was like kind of a homework assignment we'd have these jock meetings and you had to come in  with the picture of the typical listener yeah and they wanted you listening and they wanted you like  tape it in the studio and talk to that person so you could get a little more intimate with your 
[02:31:00]  listeners right so of course i went uh right for the penthouse and the playboy  oh greg is this your listener do you really think this is your typical listener uh yeah i brought  it in because i'm like if i'm gonna have to stare at something my entire shift because you know  playing music was a bore fest to begin with at least look at a hot piece of ass right yeah the  freaking pd didn't have a sense of humor and he got all mad he's like ever and then it turned out  it's got to be like a like a guy in his late 20s at the time early 30s he's got a pickup truck he 
[02:31:30]  might have a family maybe one kid he works one to one and a half jobs he it was a whole profile  and then we had these awful pictures in the studios of these zeros that you were supposed to talk and  that's who you're talking to when you do your break look at him and talk to him like he's right  here and i'm like we should do that here then go to retarded people.com and give me some photos  well then when we were at af we had the same thing remember we sat down with uh dave dickless and uh 
[02:32:00]  oh and his office not only a picture he wanted a whole description he wanted a profile where the  person uh worked where he lived what his kids names might be what kind of car he might drive  douchebags what what he would do when he wasn't working would he go to a sporting event what kind  of concert would he go to like who fucking cares he's sitting with a pen and a big yellow legal pad  asking the questions all like high and mighty so what do you think he um and in all honesty  these were the days where we had to do this shit we couldn't say go fuck yourself yep we had no 
[02:32:30]  choice we had to go through these exercises do you know i honest to god when i'm talking on this show  never ever wonder what any of you out there are doing no because if i start doing that i'm not  going to be myself those of you that like me will like me those of you that don't won't there's  nothing i can do to fix it once every once every great while for a split second i'll think  holy shit there's a lot of people listening yeah of course yeah and then and then you just put it 
[02:33:00]  out of your mind yeah i don't want to know that all of you i know i've done shitty jobs before  yeah it's not work that's why uh kelly i say when i used to work for a living it doesn't mean i'm not  putting effort into this doesn't mean i'm just coming in kicking back it means i don't consider  this work because i've worked i know being up in a hundred and twenty degree attic uh cutting myself  on sheet metal and being all itchy from insulation that's work this is hanging out uh and they just

[02:41:00]  uh black people enjoy  eating watermelon  without feeling silly about it  and without feeling you know  like they gotta eat it in the closet as he said  you know it's become this kind of stereotype thing  where you see black guy eating a watermelon  you think it's uh racist  where did that all begin by the way  do you know  i do know  no you don't  i do  there's actually a full story of it on myspace.com  jim norton  oh god  what a cheap plug  i don't know i'm gonna guess that uh  they used to eat it

[02:42:00]  there's bugs bunny  doing what he does best  and they uh  they have black guys like  kind of just laying around  sleeping with like  like with the remains of watermelon  at their feet  yeah or taking big bites  out of watermelons  yeah  i mean jess  you want to talk about  stereotyping  exaggerated features  all right let's get into it  it's pd green  he did this on  an all access tv show  or something  we'll play the first track again  just to set it up again  okay  right  gets upset when he sees people  eating watermelon  the wrong way 
[02:42:30]  i just can't understand  how we as black people  start eating watermelon  in the closet  lord have me  man  this is called the heart  you know  it makes me feel  so bad sometime  when i'm  i see black  my black brothers and sisters  and they'll see me  eating a piece of watermelon  like this  yeah  oh  and they'll go 
[02:43:00]  and they're gonna frown  their faces  i mean that's a smear book  but it's good  raheel  raheel  raheel  this is called the heart  just smacking his lips  he was actually a civil rights activist  i think this guy  he certainly wasn't  was he  yeah  what are you getting  is he making up for all  all the good he did  i don't know  what do you run out of things  to talk about  i'd like to see  cynthia mckinney doing that  in congress  stupid twat  well i'm waiting for some people to call 
[02:43:30]  but uh  they're not calling  this bitch looks crazy  she is crazy  whatever happened to that  shoving the cop thing  ah  of course  why would they pursue it  why would they  i just go  i just said  ah  and you go  of course  you of course  then ah  that's what you get on this show  exactly  brilliant commentary  and they all knew  look at her  that crazy looking bitch  with her awful  she has a fucking different hairdo  in every picture  this cunt  they should have known me  uh 
[02:44:00]  all right  i'm waiting for the  all right  we're screening the calls  we'll get back  down to the  to why watermelon  uh  here he goes  when he goes to black parties  they cut the guts up  and mess it up  what's this about  what  when it comes  because they still want to eat  the watermelon  but i guess it looks really bad  when you just pick up  the big piece of watermelon  oh right  as a black person  so i guess  they chop it up  they still love the flavor  of watermelon  so they try to  uh  camouflage it  cut it in little slices 
[02:44:30]  probably  so you can eat with a fork  quite a little  fancy and stuff  not just digging in  like him  oh lord i mother  and you know  the thing that makes me mad  when i go to their parties  they would take a big  pretty watermelon  like this  and cut all kinds  of gadgets  and then  cut the inside  just eat this good piece  of watermelon  cut all the guts  out of that good watermelon  and mix it up  and mess it up  with something else  man sometimes  they got a notion  to put liquor in  and then after  they cut them  little crevices 
[02:45:00]  and put it back  inside of that hood  man that's a waste  of watermelon  when all you got  to do with it  is pick it up  like it  look at it  pick it up  like it  you can't tell me  cutting all that  out  putting it back 
[02:45:30]  what the hell  is he  I know you're  sitting at home  saying what  because I think  I heard a nigger  yeah  did he say that  something like that  I think it was just  the collective  unconscious  of everybody listening  the mind is a  powerful thing 
[02:46:00]  wow  you get a couple  hundred thousand  people thinking  the same thing  it comes right out  how do we have  time to make this  while producing  Ron and Fez's show  is what I want to know  I don't mind  him eating the watermelon  it's the way he's going  lord  yeah he could just  eat the watermelon  yeah you gotta eat it  quietly  you know  we as black people  are allowed to enjoy  watermelon without  having to  have the stereotype  but he's like  oh lordy lord  let me tell you  how about enjoying 
[02:46:30]  it like an adult  instead of like  you should be singing  Wade in the Water  let's go to Merrick  in song of the south  Merrick  what's going on  yeah this is a doggy  with a big old dick  talking about the  watermelon  yeah you don't mind  that stereotype  now do you  so who was  who was this guy  the reason why  black people feel  kind of funny  because the white man  don't want black people  to enjoy watermelon  and chicken  and shit like that  why  because 
[02:47:00]  it tastes so good  but how did that  stereotype start  I'm saying like  yeah why watermelon  that's what we asked  today  why watermelon  because watermelon  tastes real good  and why folks like it  now but so do oranges  and apples  that is where it came from  yeah that's not where  the stereotype came from  don't make us call  the nordic nymph on ya  wet and wonderful  watermelon  wait no  I'm sorry  but who's that guy  what's his name  Petey Green 
[02:47:30]  who is Petey Green  you know who he is  no  this guy  don't know shit  I know  we're gonna move on  goodbye  thank you  with the big dick  dug out dug  hey I wanna know  why you guys  are replaying  the star interview  from yesterday  without the stuttering  oh god  stupid me  I didn't even understand  I was like  what is he talking about  uh tar baby  uh yeah  this bit fucking sucks  I would like to say  to stop this fucking  black coon  and stop this bit 
[02:48:00]  he's just a random  nigger  oh my god  what are you doing  what do you think  you think you're like  being outrageous  Brad and Atlanta  that was interesting  um yeah  watermelon came from  Jimmy you were exactly right  it was abundant  and a little bit  couldn't fill a lot of people up  and by the way  Jimmy Cynthia McKinney  is in a runoff today  and it's looking like  she's gonna get her ass  handed to her  punch it out  alright right on  thanks buddy  let's go to  uh  uh  uh  how the hell 
[02:48:30]  are you gonna get a job  with a name like that  uh  Rastus  Rastus  yes sir  how you doing today  hello  Jimmy I love your little  rabbit tits  thank you Mr  someone sent me  an instant message  today  hey sausage tits  I don't know how that  fits in but it made me happy  for serious man  uh watermelon  is not indigenous  to this country  it came from Africa  and hence  all the slaves brought it over  and it was something  that they could grow  and eat  uh  oh  alright  wash in their face 
[02:49:00]  and that is  that is why  uh  it is a black stereotype  how did they  and do what  in their face  you know  wash their face  with the watermelon  you know  when you eat it  that's how you're  supposed to eat it  it's not like  it's uh  you know  you slice it up  and salt it  or something  like the white folks  do  so  you're supposed to  eat it  when they go  wash your face  it was uh  brought from Africa  I didn't know that  I didn't know that either  okay  it was  it was not indigenous  to this country  that makes sense  thank you  thank you sir  you're welcome  some guy uh  said it's also called  ghetto ham 
[02:49:30]  but he hung up  ghetto ham  that's fine  because if you cut it  in pieces  it would look like  a little piece of ham  I don't even like  watermelon that much  I can eat a little bit of it  but I hate  holding it  the seeds annoy me  and it's sticky  there's just too much water  you know what I like  here's what I like  hello room service  yes  uh  I need a fruit plate  may may may may  cantaloupe  may may  may  honeydew  and watermelon 
[02:50:00]  and strawberries  sent up  me  immediately  me  thank you  for me  no I think  that's  all about me  I uh  I like a little watermelon  in a salad  as you said  but pineapple  makes me go  it makes my reflux  pineapple  will give you  that acid reflux  no blueberries  I like blackberries  and raspberries  I like blueberries  let's go to Nigel  I like strawberries  Kentucky  Nigel  I live by 
[02:50:30]  blueberries  Nigel  good morning everybody  yes  yes  I have a stupid question  how did it become  a black stereotype  I live in a predominantly  white area  and everybody  who eats watermelon  is always eating it  like that  I think it's more  of a poor thing  than it is a black thing  well dude the guy  just said it was  brought over by slaves  if that's true  if slaves were the  first ones to eat it  and really enjoy it  and probably you know  eat it sloppy  I mean then  then that's probably  where it came from  it's gotta be a poor  south thing  yeah  but as a kid 
[02:51:00]  you eat it like that  too though  yeah you do  but I'm saying  if the first time  white people saw  real watermelon  enjoyment  was from slaves  well then okay  that's where that  stereotype came from  look at them  they love watermelon  look at them  it is good  but we eat it  different  alright let's go back  to how to eat a watermelon  this is Petey Green  Petey Green knows  what he's doing  he doesn't like  when the  when the homies  yeah  put salt on  the old watermelon  who salts  their watermelon  apparently someone  in Petey Green's life 
[02:51:30]  do that  and you know  the thing  that makes me mad  when I go to  their parties  they will take  a big pretty  watermelon like this  and cut all kinds  of gadgets  and then  cut the inside  just eat as good  as a piece of  watermelon  wrong track  cute I'm sorry  about that  that's alright  I could hear that  a thousand times  all I'm saying  to you  be yourself  because I went  to a party  over there  with some white folks  they didn't have  it in that thing  they had slices  walk around  Petey Green  you want to say  yeah give me a slice  one they said 
[02:52:00]  I don't think  I didn't think  you blacks  eat watermelon  like that no more  I said look lady  don't try to get out  on me  you understand  you just want  to eat the good part  you want me to  cut it all up  and do it  and then you know  I was mad  with niggas  for putting salt  on the watermelon  until two old bambas  I was talking  to two cold  bloody country bambas  and I said  why y'all put salt  on the watermelon  niggas were a man  in my home  and said  you know I'm down  that bottom  in Virginia  said let me tell  you about salt  Peter  he said  you watching  niggas  puts too much  salt on  you put a twang  of salt 
[02:52:30]  on a sweet melon  and it brings out  like accent  I said what you say  he said man  I don't watch you  watching people  y'all dump salt  like you got chicken  he said but you  twang it  I never knew that  twang it  with some salt  well he's saying  the Washington blocks  according to Petey  according to the  Bama niggas  they said  this is what they said  the Washington niggas  put too much salt  on it  but he laughed

[02:59:00]  why are you listening  to the show  hi big dick daddy  I love you fuckers  I got every one of you  I know you didn't get me  I said he's a fan  yeah I was kind of  feeling it  and that's why  I didn't want you to continue  only because you said  hack almond talk  it's no such thing  damn it  I fucking suck  alright  that bitch is getting old too  by the way  Brian in Jersey  what's up  yeah I just want  to ask you  how you act like  the Howard Stern show  what  you guys try to like  do the same

[03:00:00]  Howie  is on vacation  but why  hang up  why like  this is what bothers me  you're so used  to a radio show  that dumps out  of other show references  we don't  that you just gotta like  get your shit in  and then hang up quick  because that's what  his hero does  because he doesn't  want to confront anybody  we don't cut people off  we don't censor  other shows  or tell them what to do  say what you want  don't be just a little  faggot  and hang up  because you know  that it sounds like  you're in 1989 again

[03:01:00]  on some business here  this was like  I think from late last week  we never got to  we got busy  promoting the  the comedy tour  and  I was busy  we were up in Boston  but  this is pretty good  the view is falling apart  yes apparently  they can't hold things together  while they wait  for new talent  to come on board  Rosie starts in the fall  but why in the fall  she's hibernating  for the fall ratings  whatever  that would be winter  shit  is it  funny joke 
[03:01:30]  is it for the big push  for the fall  yeah probably for the big fall  sweeps  or she's got  is she doing anything  maybe she's tied into  something contractual  and she can't  doesn't seem like  she's doing anything else  and dinner  poor old Barbara Walters  needs her  yeah  the show is  tanking  well Barbara Walters  came out and admitted  what a dishonest show  they do  she's like  wow we were gonna  try to cover for it  really  you fucking bitch  all you do is  call people out  and try to talk  about the issues  and you were gonna  lie about why  one of your biggest stars  is leaving 
[03:02:00]  and cover why  yeah they were gonna  try to make it seem  all amicable  and nice and sweet  and it wasn't  they were throwing  Star out  she doesn't get along  with Rosie  who was the new  meat being brought  into the show  but they were gonna  try to keep her on  as long as possible  make it seem amicable  keep it quiet  Star didn't want  to do that  which was like  the first thing  Star Jones has ever done  that I kind of  appreciated  yeah  and applauded  not literally  because to sit there 
[03:02:30]  and do this  yeah  by myself  would be silly  that a girl  so uh  now they gotta wait  until the other  talent comes on  with just  who's on there  now  Babs  uh  Joy Behar  Joy  uh  oh yeah  cause they  uh  they lost  what's her name  too  I forgot  yeah  what's her name  uh  Meredith Vieira  oh yeah  so it's down to  uh  the survivor chick  who used to eat bugs  don't even know her name  yeah  Joy Behar  no one really knows her  uh  Barbara Walters  and that's it  and I think a fill-in  right  a fill-in every so often 
[03:03:00]  that's it  yeah because uh  uh  they're talking about  how they can't  get anything going  it's not like  that same dynamic  I hated Star Jones  but I would take a peek  at that show  every once in a while  she kept it  she kept it interesting  because there was that  underlying tension  and stuff like that  she's a lawyer  well there was some  tension last week  Joy Behar  and the survivor girl  that like  used to like eating  bugs and stuff  who now has something  to say  and we're supposed  to listen to her  she speaks  she has a mic  in front of her  she speaks for the  young generation  yeah 
[03:03:30]  the generation  young kid  the generation  Xers  so she has something  to say  and all these  women of her age  should listen closely  she represents them  is it still  gen Xers  I don't know  is that what they are  they were talking  about the morning  after pill  and um  the survivor girl  greatest drug  since the aspirin  the survivor girl  got all worked up  the morning after pill  should come in a bottle  shaped like a boot  or a fucking bank account  that's not being  drained for 18 years 
[03:04:00]  a little booty  um  so  she got all worked up  and then her  and Joy Behar  got  got  went off  and then Barbara  Walters had a  had a calm them  both down  and then uh  back from break  this is the weirdest  thing ever  for morning TV  for the view  yeah  after this commotion  went on  they go to commercials  and when they come  back to the show  survivor girl  crying her eyes out  on Barbara's lap  on Barbara's lap  not next to Barbara  on Barbara's lap 
[03:04:30]  with her arm around her  trying to comfort her  because she had to be  at the petting zoo  and Kenny said something  right  I knew it  Kenny causing problems  all over the place  sorry  so  I mean this was a huge story  we just didn't get to  comment on this  here it is  uh  it's like leaving a baby  on the street  the survivor girl  goes off here  these kinds of issues  arouse the strongest  emotions  my heart is like  almost out of my chest  right now  that's how strongly  I just I feel very 
[03:05:00]  strongly about this  and I think  I don't think I'm alone  I think a lot of people  feel that's why  I feel as though  and I believe  that life begins  at the moment of  conception  and when that egg  is fertilized  and so for me  um  in believing that  this prevents  also though  once that fertilized egg  from attaching  to the uterine wall  so it's taking away  that environment  for that egg  to develop  which it would develop  most of the time  into a baby  a child  in this case  okay so  in taking that  that environment  away from that life  it's to me 
[03:05:30]  it's the same thing  as birthing a baby  and leaving it  on the street  oh I think that  is so extreme  is it really  the same thing  wait where's  where's the interaction  between Joy Behar  and survivor chick  that's where it was  Joy Behar  just beat her up  did she  I think it's the next clip  I wanna hear it  more ranting  Barbara cuts her off  is it the next  she didn't really  beat her up that much  no  I thought she did  this chick just  overreacted  you can hear it  in her voice  that she's already upset  because Joy Behar  was giving her a piece  I mean  Joy talks to her 
[03:06:00]  a little bit  but it got a little  blown out  she gets upset  but it's not like  there's this big  was it just before this  no I mean  I tried to cut out  some of the fat of them  like bringing up  the subject  right right right  I think Joy chimes in here  I hope so  because Joy was like  she wasn't gonna have it  so you would say  that a girl  like 12 years old  who just started  menstruating  who's been raped  by her father  or her uncle  should proceed to term  because that's a life  I'm saying there is  no listen to me  I'm saying there is  value in that life  I'm saying this  medication should be 
[03:06:30]  reserved only  for those special situations  why  this is not  this is going to be  up in your life  call in your argument  I'm saying this  I wish that it were  available  I'm not saying  I don't believe  it's the right thing  but this is a slippery slope  to just eliminating life  and you know what  for people who want  the government  to stay out of their business  and do what the heck  you want with your body  then why are you  for universal health care  you want that same government  Elizabeth calm down  by the way 
[03:07:00]  this is why  this TV sucks  and it's doomed  at this point  finally you get  some interesting  TV  and Barbara Walters  jumps in  calm down  she jumps in  to stop the fight  she stops the fight  and goes  we can't have this  I think it's later  on the clip  but she basically says  we can't have this  why  let her rip  this is the type of shit  people want to see on TV  or want to listen to  on the radio  yeah  or want to see  at your office  whatever  we love this shit  as human beings  you want that same government 
[03:07:30]  Elizabeth calm down  I can't  this makes me  why would she jump  why would she jump  in there  fucking old irrelevant  bitch  that's why  she's a dummy  calm down dear  I gotta tell you  I saw this live  it happened to be  on TV  when I got home  good cover  no honestly it was  I mean I  I have no problem  I'll check out  the view from time to time  I'd like to  you know  check out all this crap  and I was watching  I was like  wow this is gonna get good  man someone could  get punched  I mean it was getting  that good 
[03:08:00]  it was escalating  and then she jumps in  I'm like  are you kidding me  should have punched Barbara  and listen to what she says  because Survivor Girl  you know  she still wants to go  and then Barbara  has to like  show power  and who runs  the view  do what the heck  you want with your body  and why are you  for universal health care  you want that same government  Elizabeth calm down  I can't  this makes me so upset  Barbara  I know  but we all  everybody has strong opinions  and there are many other arguments 
[03:08:30]  that other people  could give you  I think the most important thing  which is what we see today  is we've got to be able  to have these discussions  and listen  to other people's opinions  and not go so crazy  that you don't listen  to anybody's opinions  I mean I heard everything you said  I just am emphatic  I barely started  Barbara sucks  and so does Elizabeth  how about they just  eat each other's assholes  fucking dumb show  I fucking  in front of Joe Rogan  I do everything I can  to get away from my 
[03:09:00]  fucking women  I don't want to hear  what their opinions are  why would you watch  five of them  just fucking  talking  it's torturous  blah blah blah blah  blah blah blah  blah blah blah  back after this  for more things  that we're normally  beaten for in the Midwest  but we can't have it  yeah  what  get it out there  put them out in  kids chewables  it's a dopey TV show  you're not getting  anything really accomplished 
[03:09:30]  no  not only should you have  morning after pill  you should be illegal  to slip to a girl  after you fuck her  they should have like  half and half  one half is a roofie  one half is the  morning after pill  drop it in her drink  that's right  good  you call it a pack  of fun pills  alright back from break  let me set this up  so there you have  Elizabeth  she obviously cried  through the whole  commercial break  yeah  watery eyes  and she's sitting  on Barbara Walter's  lap  on her lap  the wonderful thing 
[03:10:00]  about this show  is that we can have  discussions that we  feel very emotional  about  we can  and we respect  your opinions  thank you  I respect yours  I love being here  with you guys  I want to be passionate  and I love your passion  thank you  now let's have  more discussion  okay  alright  yeah  we'll be calm  and rational  and passionate  thank you  one of the things we love 
[03:10:30]  about you  is your passion  and the way you feel  what  it's the half Italian  blood in me  it exists  thank you  that's terrific  exactly  that's terrific  guaranteed she got  yelled at after the show  of course she did  you don't put on a scene  like that  on the  on a live  this is live television  how long has she been  part of that show  a long time  oh yeah  you put Barbara  in a bad position 
[03:11:00]  when the other chick  left  a few years back  you tried to make  Barbara be honest  and in the moment  yeah  oh you know  the producers  were coming over  just like  do you know  the position  you put Barbara  in  she doesn't need  that  she's Barbara  Walters  damn it  show's falling apart  it's done  alright  Rosie might help  though  I mean  she'll get viewers  she hasn't been  on daytime TV  in a long time  yeah  unfortunately  she will  she'll get viewers  oh yeah  they'll check her out  but she's got to  keep her fucking  yap shut  about her politics 
[03:11:30]  and bullshit too  she's another one  I don't know  she'll be  a little too far  to one side  she is  but she's  she smashes people  like I love the fact  that Rosie really  smashes people  though  yeah she's not  the queen of nice  anymore  no  Joy will keep her  in check I think  they'll agree  you think they'll agree  oh my god yeah  I think there's  sort of a comedian  like she's  been pissing there  longer so  I think O'Donnell  and Joy  agree  and yeah  eat Barbara  and Elizabeth  alive 
[03:12:00]  the little one  yeah  yeah they're gonna  need another person  there to kind of  balance it out  a little bit  a black woman  they gotta get  a black woman  uh-huh  uh-huh  alright  and uh  something else here  ABC News  sexy songs  this old argument  again  kids who listen  to explicit songs  are more likely  to have sex  nice  no it might be  all the drugs  they're taking  could be  but we'll ignore  that won't we  could be that  people are just  always having sex  blame it on music  blame it on video games  rock and roll  blame it on TV 
[03:12:30]  blame it on anything  but you  we gotta  the parent  we got a huge  drug problem  in this country  but uh  let's ignore that  and claim it's  it's it's it's  it's music  sucks  isn't um  things like  teen pregnancy  down  yeah  I think all that  I think all that  crap's down  so they pull  this old  fucking story  out of nowhere  that it's music  again  like explicit  lyrics  yet  years ago  during the 70s 
[03:13:00]  and stuff  that was  explicit lyrics  that did it  and then the 60s  uh  the 50s  the advent  of rock and roll  that was explicit  lyrics that made  teens have sex  I think kids are  having uh  sex a lot earlier  are they though  yeah cause the hair  is growing sooner  hormones in the chicken  that's right  that's what they say  all the steroids  and stuff  to pump up the chicken  well with the internet  I'm sure it helps  to get them away  wow good point  that's sort of like  a launching ramp 
[03:13:30]  you can lure them  yeah  you don't have to  drive up with candy  anymore  lure them I know  you can give a cyber  psst  hey  hey  I'll meet you  down by  that's right  on mcdonald's  here's uh  the story  a new study claims  teens whose  iPods are full of  music with raunchy  sexual lyrics  start having sex  sooner than those  who prefer other  songs  more tame songs  the study finds  much of the popular  music aimed at  teens contains  sexual overtones  researchers say  songs with explicit  references to sex 
[03:14:00]  acts are more  likely to trigger  early sexual behavior  than those with  more muted  sexual references  I'm done with  some Pat Boone  for the girls  please  the whole album  you have a more  than seven minutes  away from weather  and traffic  beginning with  Bill Evans  why you should  listen to the  Barry Manilow  songs  that's right  that's what's  going on this  morning  wow  more news  banter  what did he  say  what album  Pat Boone  ew 
[03:14:30]  and then  Barry Manilow  yeah  these researchers  they're trying  so hard  that's sort of  a  that's sort of  one of those  like studies  that could go  either way  like  maybe it's just  the fact that  slutty girls  like that music  you know  so  they have  sexual thoughts  they want to  have sex  and they like  listening to that  music  it has nothing  to do with  the music  making them  sexual  and then  you know  prudy  immature  or girls  that aren't  into boys  or sex  or anything  like that 
[03:15:00]  are listening  to the fucking  shitty songs  that have no  sexual lyrics  because they  don't care about  it  bring up a  good point  I'm just  thinking of  all the girls  like in high  school  that were  prudes  like flat  chested  still had  braces  at 17  they were  kids  but they  listen to  one rap  song  and all  of a sudden  they're like  size queen  sucking cock  out back  it didn't  happen  they just  would listen  to like  the shitty  music  maybe the  slutty girls  have just  found the  slutty music  found the  slutty music  that they  enjoy  they can  relate to  it  some music  about  fucking up  the ass 
[03:15:30]  alright  I do  that  yeah  you're  gonna turn  the prudes  around  with one  rap  song  gonna happen  sure  sure you  are  scientists  that's  really funny  that's like  any of those  studies that  say that  families that  eat dinner  together  the kids  are less  likely to  do drugs  it has  nothing to  do with  eating dinner  together  the physical  act of  sitting there  and eating  dinner  it means  that if  you're eating  dinner  as a family  you're probably  doing more  family oriented  things  you have an  open line of  communication  better with  your parents  a more  responsible  family  more 
[03:16:00]  responsible  family  more parental  influence upon  the kid  your parents  are around  they're not  latchkey kids  whatever they  have nothing  to do with  fucking dinner  on the table  and you're all  sitting around  a table  if you take  a bunch of  fucking crack  heads  and put  them all  together  at a table  to have  dinner  they're not  going to  stop smoking  crack  because they're  having dinner  these studies  are all skewed  they're all  fucked up  you're wrong  about the music  they try to force it  down your throat  why is that  because I was  actually a very  normal kid  and I heard  boom boom boom  let's go back  to my room  and ten minutes  later there was 
[03:16:30]  a log on my chest  boom boom  let's go to  Bill and  we can do it  all night  can we  Bill  hey  hey  my wife's sister  is a teacher  in junior high  and the girls  are getting caught  blowing both guys  in the bathrooms  now  in junior high  yeah  the blowjobs  are the new kissing  but let me tell you  what that's about  girls have been  blowing guys  since the start of time  but it's more  acceptable now  it's a status thing 
[03:17:00]  yeah a girl would  give a blowjob  and then hide  and not really  tell her friends  because I'm going  to be considered  a dirty girl  get a bad rep  but now it's like  it's alright to admit  that you're blowing guys  it's good because  then you're saving yourself  you can tell dad  hey  just blew him  don't kiss me dad  I just sucked a cock  not like I fucked  the guy  find me the 40 year old  women that are  listening to us today  that are willing to admit  they were blowing guys  in junior high  and high school  they're out there 
[03:17:30]  but they weren't  running and telling  their friends  right  it's more  it's acceptable  to hold hands  with a girl now  the girls are doing  it all the time  you couldn't get away  with that shit  in the 60s  the 70s  the 80s  especially a negro  that's right  being a lesbian  in high school  is all the rage  it wasn't when  we were in high school  yeah girls can  hold hands  kiss each other  going into class  but they were still  doing it  they were just  hiding it  yeah  are guys  doing it  in high school 
[03:18:00]  no  let's go to  Chris in  Rochelle Park  Chris  yeah I blame it  on Opie and Anthony  hoo hoo  tell them Robin  punch it out  hey you really  added to the subject  thanks  people think  they're  like that guy  obviously was a fan  he wasn't you know  anyway but  he just thought  that was funny  what does that mean  we've been blaming  for like influencing  kids on Bill O'Reilly's  Bill O'Reilly  remember he did  that whole expose  it was like 
[03:18:30]  what are you getting at  they can't prove this  they want to prove  it so bad  but they just can't  yeah  had us on  insane clown posse  Marilyn Manson  and it was like  a whole thing on how  the youth of America  is being influenced  by pop culture  and it's the downfall  of society  the beginning of the end  it's like oh  and we even try to bring up  the thing  the point of  what Bill  what about the good old days  when you didn't have like 
[03:19:00]  all this entertainment  to blame  for blatant racist  violence on the streets  wars were still going on  people were being murdered  there was sex  rape  robbery  serial killers  what the fuck  they always try  to find something  to blame it on  it's always  the latest entertainment  yeah let's say  hi to Twitchell's  Twitchell's Tears  what's up  Twitchell's Tears

[03:37:00]  That's not going anywhere.  All right.  I remember one time I was...  Horrible.  Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  I had a hooker come over.  I was getting blown by her, and the black and white TV was on, and she was fucking sucking 
[03:37:30]  my dick and looking and watching Ike Turner be interviewed, so I had to fucking get up  and turn the TV off and put the kibosh on that.  It was rather uncomfortable to see Ike being interviewed.  You should have treated her like Ike treated Tina.  Oh, just giving me the old peekaboo over my cock head.  The old peekaboo.  Huggy Bear.  Yes, sir.  What's up, Huggy Bear?  Y'all was talking about that watermelon audio earlier on, and I remember a couple months  ago y'all were talking about saying racial jokes on the CB radio. 
[03:38:00]  Didn't know if y'all wanted me to give that a try or not.  Okay.  Well, we've heard that some truckers do like a racist joke over the CB, and then a bunch  of people come back and start yelling at them.  Yes, and I'm in Columbus, Ohio right now, so I'm in a good volume area for truckers.  All right, let's see how this works.  We got a...  Any joke at all?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  A short one. 
[03:38:30]  A short one, yeah.  All righty.  Hold on.  Anybody know why Digger's lips spooked out?  It's because when they was young, their mama's pissed them, and they went huge.  Yeah, I got nothing.  There you go.  Well, I want to hear someone comment.  No one coming back?  No one came back.  You stink.  I fucking suck.  All righty.  Have a good day.  Thanks. 
[03:39:00]  Couldn't even understand his joke.  No, his joke.  I'm sure it was off.  That's why no one responded.  Wow.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll continue with the rap songs or maybe the pedestrian story as well.  We're probably done with the rap crap.  You get the idea.  You have the OJ thing, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's some new OJ thing.  We could do that for a website.  The number one rap song in America right now is this song called Shoulder Lean.  I don't know.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  It's probably like Maybelline. 
[03:39:30]  By Chuck Berry.  Another song called It's Going Down on the list.  Snap your fingers.  So what?  You and dat.  Every Lil Jon song sounds exactly alike.  I can't tell one from the other.  Pull me back.  That's because you're white.  A song called Why You Wanna.  We'll cut our losses.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  For you, motherfucker, in Point Pleasant Beach, my lovely fucking neighbor that has to keep calling the township on me 
[03:40:00]  can play every little fucking thing.  Fuck you.  Get a life.  Get a wife.  And fucking die.  Somebody fuck you to the receiver at Cisco in Westbrook Bay.  You're a fucking asshole.  You mumble like a fucking bitch.  Fuck you.  And the beard makes you look like a fucking cunt.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'm gonna give a fuck you over to Con Ed.  I got no electricity six days, and now there's still trucks in my fucking neighborhood. 
[03:40:30]  Fuck you, Con Ed.  Yeah, this is for all the laugh dogs I work with who treat the boss's ass like a watering hole in the middle of the desert.  Fuck you.  Fuck all you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE1.  That's 866-FU-LINE1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuck him.  I think too dramatic from all our lies. 
[03:41:00]  It is the dawning of the hearts of our lives.  On all the time.  Let's say hi to Scott in Connecticut.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Scott.  I want to call and say, I don't think it matters what type of music's playing.  I used to get blowchops with Paul Adbu going on in the background.  Oh.  That's not the music, say.  Yeah, I know.  Of course. 
[03:41:30]  Thank you, E-Rock.  All right, let's move on.  Moving on segment of the show.  We tried to move on.  Moving on.  This is a pretty interesting story.  Jesus.  Yesterday, we had the guy that had his finger chopped off.  Bitten off, yeah.  Yeah, what am I saying?  Bitten off.  And then the guy who bit it off wouldn't give it back.  His brother-in-law wouldn't give it back. 
[03:42:00]  Ran into the car, rolled the window up, and chewed his finger up so it couldn't be reattached.  Right.  Well, here's Prick.  Here's today's crazy news story.  A pedestrian run over and killed after being struck by three vehicles.  And Orlando police say no one stopped to help.  It happened at around midnight on Orange Blossom Trail near Silver Star Road.  The driver was in a silver Dodge Durango.  He drove away, but while the man's body was in the street, two more cars ran over him. 
[03:42:30]  Police were able to identify the victim but are still searching for the driver of the Durango.  Oh, that's so simple.  No one wants to get home.  You just want to get home.  Years ago, my mother was driving home from work.  You know, she was a cocktail waitress for many years, and so her hours were ridiculous.  So she's driving home, like, really late at night, and she sees somebody laying in the street, just like laying in the road. 
[03:43:00]  So she pulls off into the parking lot of this mall, little strip mall on the side of the road, and there's no cell phones back then.  And she doesn't really quite know what to do, and a car comes racing down the road, just runs the guy right over.  She saw that?  Yeah, and the guy stopped and was freaking out, was, like, freaking out.  And she was like, no, he was already laying there.  She's trying to calm the guy down.  Don't worry.  He was already laying in the street. 
[03:43:30]  Well, was he just a drunk that fell asleep?  I don't know.  Was he dead?  And then another car came and ran him over.  What did he say?  What did he do?  Mom.  What did he do?  Poor mom.  Yeah, she didn't care.  Just horrified on the side of the road.  She's like me.  She doesn't care.  Well, no one cares.  No one cares.  You don't want to stop and have to deal with that crap.  What are you going to do?  She goes, I'll wait 20 years for the cell phone to be invented.  One time I was driving home on Route 130 and I ran over a dog that was dead. 
[03:44:00]  And I felt so bad.  I pulled over and cried.  It's dead.  You're dead?  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  I was already dead, though.  I didn't kill it.  What was the biggest thing you ever hit?  Was that it?  A dead German Shepherd or whatever it was, yeah.  A dog?  I never hit an animal.  I almost hit a deer.  I never hit an animal.  Possum?  Yeah.  Over both tires.  Front and then back.  We were starting our car in the driveway once and then we heard a thud and lifted the hood up  and apparently a cat had crawled under the hood. 
[03:44:30]  They like to do that.  And it had tried to walk through the fan and it just like cracked its back right on the radiator fan.  Wait, while the car was running it tried to walk?  Yeah.  It tried to.  It must have gotten, you know, it was laying on the engine because it's nice and warm or something.  And my mom started it up and that was it.  Boom.  Ladies and gentlemen, Twitchells.  Twitchells.  Yo.  What's up?  There he is.  Who's this? 
[03:45:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, they put me through the office of that guy.  What's up?  I just woke up.  Well, we think you're unstable.  Yeah.  More unstable than most of us.  You and me both, man.  Like you were crying at the ONA traveling virus?  What is going on with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're.  I woke up the next morning feeling like a complete ass.  And I think it was pretty fair to say that.  What was the main issue? 
[03:45:30]  Well, first of all, just to say, I've been going through a lot of shit.  A lot of people want me to go back on medicine and I don't want to do it.  And the one thing is I've always been nervous about being around, like, a lot of people, like, like, in those times.  I didn't know what the Pennington thing was going to be like.  And I worked in a show before where I was in a thing like that where the people were passing by.  I was, like, audience interactive.  And I've been punched before.  And I just, I know I was actually a baby, but I just get really overprotective. 
[03:46:00]  And I really politely brought it up to, uh, to Kenny.  Who would want to punch you?  Just so busy.  He was so busy and so stressed and he had too much stuff going on.  You know, Twitchels, you don't stand still long enough for anyone to be able to punch you.  Yeah, really.  They'd have to be good.  I know, I know that.  Absolutely.  And I definitely, definitely didn't, didn't understand the whole concept.  And I took it, you know, uh, the wrong way.  Twitchels, Twitchels.  I definitely didn't complain or anything. 
[03:46:30]  Twitchels, when, when were you at an event where you got punched?  Uh, I was at a show called Nightmares Extreme Screen Park at the Wachovia Spectrum.  It was a show that ran for, uh, two years.  It was actually coming back to the spectrum in Philadelphia.  And what, but what happened?  And, like, what, I was supposed to, I'm on stage doing my thing.  I, I was the host of the show and I jump off stage and I, like, you know, go around the  people and basically kind of, like, you know, walk, try to scare the people.  And I scared this one guy and he pumps me for scaring him. 
[03:47:00]  And he got escorted out.  Now, isn't that different?  That's so much different.  Isn't that different than just the, the petting zoo thing?  You know, where, where it's like, you, you, you, you really didn't need to be concerned  about your safety.  What we're hearing is you're more concerned about maybe getting a laminate instead of the  wristband and that you weren't being treated, um, like you felt.  Oh, absolutely not.  That's not, that's not the case at all whatsoever. 
[03:47:30]  I was, I was definitely, I'm definitely, first of all, I'm definitely content at what I'm  doing.  That's not, that's not the, the problem at all.  A lot of people were asking me about why wasn't I on the stage.  And to be honest, as a comedian, I didn't think I'm ready to be even, you know, on a  show with the caliber of comics that are up there.  It had nothing to do with that at all.  I just get nervous when, you know, it was my first time doing something where, you know,  like where it would, I didn't know what that was going to be like and I just got nervous.  So, you know, and I, I wasn't complaining at all. 
[03:48:00]  I didn't make it, I didn't make it seem, I didn't make it, you know, I didn't  seem, you know, even try to come off like that way at all.  It was very nice.  Was Kenny nice to you?  I never, I never complain.  Was Kenny nice to you?  I'm not the easiest person.  All right, so you got to listen a little bit.  You're just babbling.  Was Kenny nice to you?  Was Kenny nice to you?  Absolutely not.  No, not at all.  I don't think he knows that word.  What happened?  Now, now, cause we're here in stores, like I heard from you actually that he said, um, 
[03:48:30]  uh, who the fuck do you think you are?  Absolutely.  I, I, I wrote down exactly what he said so I wouldn't forget.  Oh, okay.  What, what, what is it?  Give us the Kenny quote.  Wait.  He said, Twitchell, they need to talk to you.  This is in front of Pat from Renanke.  It was in front of a couple other people from the, from the past.  All right, get Pat on the phone.  All right, Twitchell's, Twitchell's, hold on, hold on, hold on.  This was after you, uh, told Kenny your concerns about being in front of a lot of people and  you were worried about your safety, right?  The way I worded it was, I just wanted, I didn't know if security was going to be in 
[03:49:00]  that area at all because I didn't see anyone, so I politely asked.  That's all I did.  All right, and I want to hear what Kenny, like, yeah, what did Kenny say to you?  All right, guys, uh, I'm looking at it right now.  He said to me exactly, who the fuck do you think you are?  Well, first, these are Twitchell's I need to talk to.  He says, who do you think you are?  He says, who the fuck do you think you are?  And she says, we do not need you.  We do not need you.  That's why you're not on the big stage.  And that's why you're in the petting zoo.  You're a nobody. 
[03:49:30]  And whether or not all of that is true, I mean, I'm man enough to admit that, you know,  all the shit I go through, my emotional person.  And I just, I just took it.  Maybe he was fucking with me, but I took it the wrong way.  And I figured, if I'm going to break down, I'd rather do it at the hotel than  there.  I've gone through my stuff in my life, and that's just, I'm honest.  I'm man enough to admit that.  All right, Kenny.  You took that the heart.  Twitchell, shut up for a second.  Call up so to Kenny.  Yeah.  Is that what you said to Twitchell's?  Absolutely not. 
[03:50:00]  And I believe Pat Fumanaki already backed me up by saying I didn't say, who the hell do  you think you are?  No, it was, who the fuck do you think you are?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I didn't speak to him that way.  You know, and, you know, Twitchell's has his demented perception.  I'm not going to debate the issue with him.  I already said my piece.  Pat backed me up.  All right?  And the thing is, is that I think it's reasonable to conclude he said he got nervous, that he  had anxiety and had a panic attack and freaked out. 
[03:50:30]  And like I also said, this isn't the first encounter I had with Twitchell's and his big  inflated ego.  All right?  At Bill's bar in Boston, he was bringing people into the VIP area, and I asked him not to  do it, and he continued to do it.  So I threw him out of there, and it was one of the issues in the media studio.  It's another example.  Oh my, you are such a fucking liar, and you know it, you douchebag.  You fucking piece of shit ass wife.  That is such a lie.  I never got thrown out of Bill's bar. 
[03:51:00]  You never even talked to me about bringing people.  I never brought anyone to the IP room.  What an ass.  No, you didn't get thrown out of Bill's bar.  I removed you from behind the velvet ropes next to the stage.  No, you did not.  I don't know why you keep making these things up in your head.  That's a, wait, is this for the show?  Are you trying to do something in the show?  You know what, Twitchell's, Twitchell's, you're right, I'm wrong.  You're everything, I'm nobody.  That is not the case at all. 
[03:51:30]  That is not the case at all.  All right?  I never said that.  I never said that.  First of all, I'm the most unegotistical person that I can think of.  I'm so lucky to be a part of a show like this.  And you know what, Kenny?  I don't think you realize how fucking lucky you are.  All right?  You have no right to talk to people that way.  Yeah!  And to act like, oh my God, dude.  You're making up blatant lies, and you're sitting there, and you know it.  Why would Kenny make things up?  I'm not taking any sides here. 
[03:52:00]  I'm just, you know, we're plowing through the testimony here.  But why would Kenny lie about something like that?  I have no idea.  I would definitely not lie about that at all.  I mean, that's just, first of all, talking about the Worcestershire, the virus tour,  it just completely came out of left field.  Completely came out of left field.  Everything he exactly said, exactly what I said is what he said to me.  And I would have no reason to make that up.  I'd have no reason to lie.  All right? 
[03:52:30]  First of all, for the record, everybody says, okay, don't worry about it.  Kenny seems like he acts like everybody.  That's just his persona.  He's a dickhead to everybody, yada, yada, yada.  Well, that's fine.  If he has a reputation of being a dickhead, I understand that.  But that doesn't mean that you have to take it out on people,  and you have to, there's a certain professionalism you've got to have,  and he doesn't even know what that is.  I'm getting communiques from people that saw the whole incident,  and they're saying, Twitchels, that you're lying.  I'm not lying. 
[03:53:00]  I'm not lying.  Get Pat from Menachia on the phone, too, please.  Let's get Pat on the phone.  Try to get him to testify.  We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.  So, Twitchels, you don't seem to like Kenny.  When did that start?  Oh, first of all, just, you know what?  I never not liked Kenny.  I would always try to be nice.  I would always try to start a conversation.  I know when that thing was going on with a petition,  when he lost his, when he was going to lose his job,  or I don't know the whole story. 
[03:53:30]  Something about the thing, you know, the whole conversation that happened.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's a pedophile, right.  I signed a petition.  I even sent emails of support to, you know, to batch him up.  I was always trying to do everything I can to get on the guy's good side.  He just never seemed like he liked me.  All right, Kenny, hold on for one second.  I got Pat on the line, but I can't get all three of you on.  Hold on.  Pat.  Copy.  Yeah.  You're on with Twitchels.  Hey, Twitchels.  Yeah. 
[03:54:00]  Now, to be perfectly honest, I didn't hear every single word.  It was a rather short conversation,  and I did not hear Kenny say,  who the fuck do you think you are?  I heard him say, you're not for the main stage,  and you're for the petting zoo,  and he was pointing towards the stage,  and then he was pointing towards the petting zoo,  and that's basically what I heard.  Now, was, hold on, Twitchels, Twitchels,  Twitchels, hold on.  Was one of them being confrontational? 
[03:54:30]  A pet?  Well, Kenny, after he was asking about,  he kind of kept going on about his concerns about the petting zoo.  Kenny kind of assured him about the,  there was a production manager, a big guy.  He said he was going to protect them  and everybody else in the petting zoo,  and then he was sort of,  he kept going on about the concerns.  And then,  and then that's when Kenny,  Kenny,  Diplopat. 
[03:55:00]  He kept somebody down verbally.  I mean,  no,  Kenny can be intimidating.  He intimidates me.  That's his job.  Well, that is his job.  That is his job.  Of course.  He is.  But,  but there's a difference between being intimidating  and being professional and doing his job  and saying,  who the fuck do you think you are?  And,  and you,  that's why I didn't hear.  Twitchels is saying like,  you know,  I've tried to talk to Kenny  and have some small talk,  whatever.  Kenny doesn't have time for chit chat.  No, 
[03:55:30]  no.  Yeah.  You know how many phone calls Kenny got,  uh,  in Worcester on Saturday?  Hundreds.  What was it?  Did Kenny get more calls than Twitchels made from his hotel room?  Right.  All right.  Hold on,  Pat.  Let's get back to Kenny.  Hey,  Kenny.  Yes.  Hello.  All right.  Anything else you want to say to Twitchels?  Uh,  nah,  you know what?  Just,  uh,  let them live and be well.  God bless them.  Twitchels,  were you on something?  That might've made you think things that didn't really happen?  I,  I,  no,  and,  and to be completely honest,  I did smoke before the show because my tics were really bad. 
[03:56:00]  I was trying to calm down and sometimes it does make me paranoid.  Why would you calm down?  The whole reason we had you,  uh,  part of the show at all was for you to,  uh,  Twitch your ass off.  No.  So why are you trying to calm down the Twitches?  No,  no,  it was like way before the show started just to initially calm down because it would have  wore off like that.  No,  instead of pot,  you need,  uh,  coffee and Red Bull.  That's the deal we've made with you.  Instant feedback's coming in.  Uh,  Kenny should have punched him in the face.  Then he would have been Lewis bleeding from the nostrils. 
[03:56:30]  Santani.  I,  you know,  just in my defense,  I did not make up a lie.  And it's no,  it's no point to,  to debate that.  And I wish him all the best as well.  You know what though?  You know what I'm seeing here?  It's almost like that scene,  that courtroom scene where Kenny is being very calm,  cool and collected.  And you pretty much like,  you just exploded a few minutes ago on the phone calling Kenny,  like a piece of shit,  piece of shit and awful things and a liar.  Because just,  just,  just thinking about that. 
[03:57:00]  I know I,  I,  it happened to me.  So I know what happened.  And you know,  there was,  you know,  there was a few people around when it happened.  Everybody's story is going to be different,  but I know what happened to me.  Just thinking of that is definitely making me,  you know,  enraged right now because I don't know how he has the nerve to just lie.  I don't,  I don't think he would need to lie.  Why can't you just be honest and tell you that's exactly what he said.  I'm not making that up.  Did you tell Pat from Unaki that you might be naked in the hotel room?  No.  Wow.  There's a lot of lying going on here. 
[03:57:30]  Pat,  Pat.  Yes.  Did he tell you he might be naked in the hotel room?  He said he's open.  And,  and that was,  and that was,  we were discussing the potential nakedness.  If you say one more wishy-washy thing.  Oh my God.  Chop off two more toes.  Can you fucking commit to anything?  You know,  he said he'd be in quite underwear.  Holy shit.  You're going to work for this show.  You're perfect. 
[03:58:00]  Hired.  So,  so he didn't say anything about being naked.  Yeah.  No,  yes,  he did.  Oh,  what did he say?  He said that he's used to,  he's used to rooming with a comedian.  Right.  And that he's,  he's very open.  And,  oh,  what did he say?  He might,  he might be naked.  And he might be naked.  So Twitchels,  why did you just say that you didn't talk to Pat about being naked in the hotel room?  I didn't talk to him about being naked. 
[03:58:30]  No,  no,  no.  What happened was,  I was shifting off my shirt and he looked at me like I should,  like I needed to go in the restroom to do it.  And,  you know,  I'm like,  it's no big deal.  Like I'm used,  I,  you know,  I'm used to being around,  you know,  I'm used to growing up in theater.  I'm used to like,  you know,  traveling.  I've roomed with other guys.  It's no big deal.  Were you hitting on Pat?  Were you hitting on Pat?  I am cute.  Man,  man.  Hey Twitchels,  did you say something about when Kenny does Jay Leno,  then he can talk?  No,  I did not.  No, 
[03:59:00]  I did not say that.  Somebody said that was not me.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  I got the whole thing here. 
[03:59:30]  You do?  Yeah,  I mean,  Twitchels is paranoid to begin with.  He smoked a little herb before the show,  and he was out of his fucking mind.  He took everything seriously.  He thought he was hearing things to a point,  and then you ran into Anthony crying your eyes out,  and then you spent the night in the hotel room that we paid for instead of being at the show. 
[04:00:00]  The drugs got the best of you.  The drugs.  Got to get off the drugs, son.  He did say those things to me.  I can't tell you right now.  Pat can't say anything.  He's not brave enough.  I can't say stuff.  Pat's a hostile witness.  Yeah.  You call him up to testify,  and he turns on you.  No,  Pat's a fucking,  he's a noodle witness.  He just fucking falls and mushes.  I think you're going to fall under questioning.  Nah,  he didn't talk for...  Pat,  Pat,  let's simplify this. 
[04:00:30]  Paper,  paper or plastic?  Uh...  Pat,  Pat,  Pat,  Pat,  Pat.  Pat,  well,  they both have their good points and bad points.  Oh,  yeah.  Pat,  who's being more truthful about the incident?  I believe Kenny's being accurate.  Hey,  Kenny can be...  He was being intimidated.  I told you.  Oh,  my God,  you wish you wanted me.  Hey, 
[04:01:00]  a fucking...  Hey,  hey,  a fucking...  Who's being more truthful about the incident?  Kenny,  I believe,  has a more accurate recollection of what happened.  You wordy jizzbucket.  Because he just...  No,  because...  I don't remember.  Yes.  Kenny,  I believe...  Instead of saying Kenny...  It depends on the definition of what...  What's accurate is.  I'll give you the definition.  You're a wishy-washy douche. 
[04:01:30]  That's accurate.  Good print there,  sir.  Good print?  You're taking a man at Pat.  I love Pat.  No,  you just want to give him some fucking spine.  Kenny?  Yes,  hello.  I believe you,  my friend.  Pat called you a faggot and a liar.  Yeah,  it's all right.  You know,  it's tough to be the disciplinarian,  but I got big,  broad shoulders.  I can handle it.  And Twitchels,  I'll say this to you.  I'm sorry that I upset you.  But I'm not sorry for putting you in your place. 
[04:02:00]  You know what,  Kenny?  I'm just upset that you're not 100% true.  If I'm not upset putting you in my place,  then why don't you just tell them what you said to me?  You got nothing to lose.  I did tell the truth,  Twitchels,  and if you listen to what you said,  you basically admit it to everything.  All right?  You're doing double talk.  Yeah,  I tend to believe the stone sober guy,  not the guy that was smoking herb before everything went down.  I think Kenny,  Kenny probably talks like Kenny does. 
[04:02:30]  Just how Kenny is.  You know,  we got things to do.  I mean,  Kenny can make you feel stupid if you don't know him,  and Twitchels being paranoid and high,  probably took it 50 degrees beyond where it should have been.  Right.  All right.  He said,  we don't need you.  Did you not say that,  Kenny?  I'll go over this.  Did you not say that?  Twitchels.  I did say that.  I said,  if you don't feel comfortable here,  we're not going to make you do anything you don't feel comfortable doing,  so you can leave. 
[04:03:00]  Absolutely.  And I did.  Absolutely.  But it wasn't because of that.  I left because of you,  because of what you said to me,  man.  And you just admitted it.  You just said that.  Right.  Exactly.  That's what I said.  You were worried about having a bodyguard,  and I told you nothing was going to happen.  There was a production manager in the village that was going to take care of you,  and I told you,  if you weren't comfortable,  we weren't going to force you to do anything you didn't want to do,  and if you wanted to leave, 
[04:03:30]  you were going to be fine.  And you know what?  You told me that.  You told me it was going to be fine,  and I dropped it.  You came up to me five minutes later out of the blue and said,  Twitchels,  let me tell you something.  Let me talk to you.  Where's Barbara Walters when you need it?  Five minutes later.  You already told me that.  No,  Twitchels,  I didn't come up to you five minutes later.  That was in your dreams.  I had one encounter with you that was in front of Pat Munaki  and played a production guy from the village.  Listen,  I first brought up my concerns about that when you pinched the bracelets in the hallway, 
[04:04:00]  and then when we had the confrontation was right in front of the petting zoo,  and that's when you said,  you're a nobody,  we don't need you,  and yada,  yada,  yada,  yada,  and you just admitted to that.  Yeah,  you're right,  so what's your point?  Thank you.  You just said I'm right.  Jump.  Jump.  I don't think there's anything else to say if you just said I'm right.  Jump.  No,  Kenny,  did you call him a nobody?  Kenny?  What happened? 
[04:04:30]  Kenny?  I don't know if it's been the whole time.  Kenny,  are you still there?  Just admit it,  dude.  You're not going to lose your job.  Just admit it.  Did you call him a nobody?  I don't think Kenny's there.  No,  I didn't call him a nobody.  No,  I didn't call him a nobody.  Took you long enough to answer that.  You should have.  Was,  uh,  was,  uh,  was Letterman brought up or Leno or something?  Leno.  Did I bring it up?  No,  did it,  did Twitchell's.  Did Twitchell's.  I heard, 
[04:05:00]  they got back to me that Twitchell's,  his retort to,  when the short bus comedy tour can sit off the arena,  then I'll be his road manager.  His retort to that was,  well,  did Kenny,  uh,  you know,  and when Kenny wasn't on Letterman.  Leno.  I mean,  Leno,  whatever.  And,  and Twitchell's,  you said that?  I,  I heard somebody say that.  I did not say that.  First of all,  I went on Leno,  I shook my loose slab.  That's nothing.  I would never use that as a retort.  Give me a break.  Somebody said that though. 
[04:05:30]  I,  I don't know who.  I didn't say that.  So,  Lewis,  Lewis,  when you,  when did you start crying?  Is this Jimmy?  Yes.  What happened was,  after he said that to me,  and he was like,  and he said,  if you don't feel comfortable,  you can leave.  This is after he just said,  I'm a nobody,  and you don't need yada,  yada,  yada.  And like I said,  regardless of all that's true,  I know he was stressed and busy.  I,  as soon as he said that to me,  and as soon as he said that,  I just,  I just,  I just,  I'm so,  I'm such an emotional person,  and all the shit I grew up with,  it just felt like high school again, 
[04:06:00]  to be completely honest with you,  just felt like high school again.  And I started to get really emotional,  and I didn't want to throw an experience  from anybody else,  so I decided that I would just leave,  and go back,  and that was,  wait,  I would tell you,  not a few minutes after it happened,  then I left,  and I walked back to the hotel,  I'm in the hotel,  walking through the hallway,  and that's when I run into Anthony and Melinda.  And then,  I was holding it up to that,  at that point.  When I ran into Anthony,  yeah,  and Melinda, 
[04:06:30]  and they saw that I was upset,  and they took notice of it,  it just poured out,  it just,  I broke in front of them.  So I wasn't crying until I ran into them,  it just broke right in front of them,  but they could tell I was cheery-eyed and upset.  What did they say that set you off into tears?  Nothing,  I just burned it into them,  and I didn't want anyone to see me that way,  I tried to go right to the hotel,  but I'm walking right in front of them,  and they're looking at me,  I don't know if it was Anthony or Melinda  that said what's wrong,  but,  you know,  just initiating a conversation,  and just, 
[04:07:00]  I was to the point where,  if I opened my mouth to anyone,  I was just going to break down,  I was trying to just stay stern,  and just walk to the hotel.  I'm a crybaby,  I admit that,  but if something hurts me,  I can't help how I feel.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Who did you call for 35 hours in the hotel room? 
[04:07:30]  Huh?  Who did you call for 35 hours in the hotel room?  I made one call home.  What?  I made one call home.  You made three phone calls.  I made one phone call home.  Made one phone call home to my mom.  I called my mommy.  The other two were from Pat trying to find his daddy.  Yeah,  Pat,  did Pat make calls? 
[04:08:00]  Let's find out.  Pat,  Pat?  Yes?  Did you make any phone calls from the hotel room?  No,  I had my cell phone.  All right,  let's go back to Kenny and Twitchells.  All right.  Okay,  someone is lying here.  Pat said he made no phone calls.  He had his cell phone.  There were three calls made from the room.  Twitchells,  did you make three calls?  I called,  my phone was dead,  first of all.  My phone ended up dying.  So I made a phone call to my mom. 
[04:08:30]  I'm trying to think.  Trying to think.  I made one phone call to my mom.  I think.  I have the phone numbers.  It might have been,  it might have been like,  it might have been like Pat or Paul  because I was calling them to find out  where they were at one point.  I think.  I'm not sure.  All I remember,  the only conversation I remember  is calling my mom.  That's all I remember.  Wait,  Kenny,  what's the prices on the calls?  Are there two that are like a buck  and then one that's like $33?  One was $25  and the other one was like  four something and five something.  Of course Kenny knows this info. 
[04:09:00]  It's right in front of him.  He's got his thumb on it.  So we can call him tomorrow.  All right.  It was probably one,  maybe it was a call to Pat,  whatever,  and they charged you triple in a hotel.  So Twitchells,  what did you end up doing  while everyone was having a good time  at the DCU center?  I ended up chilling in the hotel room  just trying to calm down.  Anthony told me I should just go back  and try to calm down  and if I felt like going back,  go back.  If I didn't,  didn't.  And I just ended up falling asleep. 
[04:09:30]  What's the last time you looked at the clock?  What time was it?  I forget.  Were you wondering what everybody was doing  at that point?  Would I be walking to the stage?  I have no idea.  I remember waking up  when Pat came back after the show.  All right.  But I did leave the room for a little bit  and went downstairs.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  People want to...  Dave in Utah.  What's up?  This is Dave.  Dave?  Yeah.  What's up?  I'm calling it as a character witness for Kenny, man. 
[04:10:00]  I don't have anything to lose  or anything to gain from this,  but I went to an Orton show once  with my girlfriend  and we met Kenny.  He's the nicest fucking guy I've ever met.  So whatever Twitch will say,  it's bullshit.  Character witness.  There you go.  Character witness is coming forward here.  Renee in Georgia.  Hello.  Hey.  I'm Renee's vengeance.  I was on last week  with my black underwear.  Yes.  Point of reference.  I know you.  Yes, and I spoke to Kenny.  I inadvertently offended him,  but he's very cool. 
[04:10:30]  And I was a cop,  and I have to say  that when you're doing security  and the level of activities  that he has to take care of  and working with people,  you don't have time  to coddle prima donnas  and mince words with people.  You don't have to be rude,  and I don't think Kenny was.  Hey, Renee,  what was the thing you said  that offended Kenny?  Did you comment on his hay-dry hair?  Well, this other guy  was talking about  getting a Desert Eagle,  and I said that that was  either to collect  or for men with small penises, 
[04:11:00]  and he thought I was referring  to carrying a 9mm,  but I carry a 9mm,  so it was funny.  Gun humor.  Yes, sir.  That's what cops enjoy.  Thank you.  It's not gun or racial.  It's not funny.  Yes.  Double mint,  whatever kind of gum you have.  All right, let's get out of here.  Let's get out of here.  So, Twitchels,  you're going to take a break  from the show.  I'm here.  It's just, you know,  being along so much by Tressa,  this is going to be getting  a lot worse,  and I just think I just need 
[04:11:30]  a break from everything.  Just trying to calm down.  Why did you do that?  Why did you spend  on your love at me?  I'm sorry.  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  Twitchels.  Don't laugh at me!  You're in a tough position.  Your Tressa's getting worse, 
[04:12:00]  but that's the whole reason  you're on the show.  Absolutely.  I gotta tell you something.  I don't regret  ever coming on the show.  I love you guys.  You've done so much for me.  I don't have nothing to do  with the game.  You know,  I felt it coming,  and I started turning around,  and it was already over.  I knew you were hanging up.  Bring on the next freak.  Kenny.  Yeah.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, listen.  I do the best I can 
[04:12:30]  for you guys,  and I try to treat people like...  It had to happen.  Poor little cliche  tumbled out.  Oh, boy.  Here come the emails.  You look at Kenny's mouth  is a cliche factory.  Here come the emails.  Bird in a hand, click.  That was too funny.  Perfect.  I didn't see that one coming.  Pat Omenaki.  Hey.  Hey.  Well, at least you told the truth.  Ugh. 
[04:13:00]  Whatever that was.  At least now Twitchels  knows what the underside  of that shirt bust looks like.  Yeah, but the problem is,  dude, how come you so...  Why are you so wishy-washy?  Yeah, really.  Because I...  Because I...  Because I...  Exactly.  Beat it, fat body.  Click.  He'll probably call back.  That wasn't my phone.  What happened?  Operator, we've been disconnected.  Best old ex-friend, Ray.  And that's how it ends today. 
[04:13:30]  It has nothing to do with  if you like us or hate us  as long as you're listening.  We are so pathetic.  It's a little dicey.  I get on mic,  I call people jerk-offs,  and I look at the internet.  I'll have a bikini-keini.  I'm a feces consistency tester.  We are pieces of shit.  We spend all morning  just smashing each other in the face.  We need to remember  that we are professionals  in the entertainment industry.  The Morton and Faggot Show. </pre>
