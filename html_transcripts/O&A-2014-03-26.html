<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nostalgic look back at their 20-year radio career, sparked by an old video.  They humorously contrasted the technological limitations of their early career – beepers and the challenges of scheduling – with the convenience of modern smartphones.  A slideshow presentation chronicled the evolution of cell phones from bulky 90s models like the Motorola StarTac and various Nokia phones to the iPhone, which they deemed revolutionary.  The segment was peppered with jokes about the frustrations of early texting and the clunky nature of older phones.

Following this, they discussed receiving top-tier service from Samsung, receiving new Note 3 phones and smartwatches, with Roland, a team member, present in studio to demonstrate the devices.  The conversation revolved around the functionalities and initial setup difficulties, including the smartwatch’s incorrect time display, all punctuated with jokes and anecdotes. Roland's habit of briefly wearing sports jerseys after significant events led to a discussion about Mark Sanchez's career and the upcoming April Fool's Day.  A memo reminding radio stations to clear pranks with management prompted a recounting of their infamous "Mayor's Prank" and their interaction with a panicked Dave Douglas.  The segment concluded with further discussions about Roland’s connections, including a local baker and his cronuts, accompanied by more off-color jokes and tangents.

The show continued with a discussion of past dealings with a previous employer, including a humorous anecdote about receiving a pay raise announcement at a Chinese buffet and a subsequent near-fight.  They detailed their competitive relationship and eventual departure, leading to them being sought after by other stations.  The hosts then lamented the lack of current interest in their show, attributing it to pre-existing listener subscriptions, despite the show's quality.  The conversation shifted to past April Fool's Day pranks, referencing examples from other stations (a flooded tunnel, a volcano eruption hoax) and their own, including Ronnie B.'s "best of" compilation prank. They recounted their own pranks, including one involving mud in coffee cups, and a caller shared a Bubba the Love Sponge prank involving a fake gunman. Opie also recounted successfully trolling Bubba on Twitter.

A substantial portion featured a video clip from their "Real Rock TV" show showing increasingly abusive treatment of an Elmo puppet, culminating in its destruction in a wood chipper.  The hosts’ commentary included discussions of their intentions, their personal reactions, and anticipated audience responses, including their wives' reactions.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of the Rolling Stones cover featuring Kiss and Paul Stanley's comments about Gene Simmons and the band’s history, particularly the exclusion of Ace Frehley and Peter Criss from potential reunions.  They analyzed Stanley and Simmons’ perspectives, drawing parallels to their own show's history, and contrasted the spontaneity of their past shows with the controlled environment of current broadcasting. The segment ended with the teasing of more archival video releases.

The next segment heavily focused on Kiss's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, specifically the exclusion of Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. The hosts debated the merits of inducting the band without its original lineup, discussing the dynamics within Kiss and the personalities of its members. Ace Frehley licensing, not selling, his makeup rights and his expected reclamation of them was also mentioned, along with Gene Simmons’ impending retirement.  The discussion broadened to other band reunions (Metallica, Guns N' Roses), and a caller challenged their perspective using Metallica's induction as a counter-example.  Other unrelated topics included criticism of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame itself, critiques of President Obama's foreign policy, a humorous discussion about emu eggs and an anecdote about ostrich semen as a food item, discussion of a wingsuit base jump from Mount Everest, outrage at a school's dress code policy regarding a student who shaved her head in support of a friend with cancer, and a funny "People's Court" clip featuring the catchphrase "D's nuts." The "Bugatti Boys" were mentioned as being in the studio, and the hosts frequently checked their podcast download numbers.

The final segment primarily focused on three topics: the Oscar Pistorius trial and Nancy Grace's coverage (with a focus on her emphasis on pornography), the NFL's new rules against using the football as a prop in celebrations, and an interview with Joe Gwinn, a daredevil wingsuit jumper planning to jump from Mount Everest.  The hosts’ vulgar mockery of Nancy Grace was prominent. Humorous speculation about the NFL rule changes and Joe Gwinn's bizarre anecdotes, including a Yeti encounter, were also featured. Other news items discussed included a school banning leggings and yoga pants and a Rhode Island man confronting a senator about the Second Amendment. The segment ended with podcast promotion and teasing of future appearances.  Joe Gwinn was the only guest besides the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, good morning everyone. Welcome.  Hello.  Enjoy yourselves.  Greetings.  We are here for you.  Right?  Absolutely.  White glove. White glove.  White glove.  Did a lot since yesterday's show.  Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  We're in a meeting for a while.  Got some new technology.  That was a toy meeting.  Yeah.  We got some toys.  Found an old video.  Oh boy.  When we started radio together 20 years ago.  Wow.  Somewhere around here, I think.  No, it actually was in the summer, right?  It was.  It was the OJ.  The OJ.  It was the OJ that got us together a long time ago.  The OJ.  I was just thinking what kind of phones were available then. 
[00:01:00]  I'm starting to think what songs were out, what movies were out, what technology was out.  I didn't have a cell phone when we first got together.  I sure didn't.  I know other people did.  Yeah.  Ninety-four people were starting to get cell phones, right?  Yeah.  People had...  You kind of had to be, I think, rich, though.  A little bit.  It was that switch over from the car phone.  I didn't have a car phone either.  A cell phone, yeah.  Because people used to have the little pigtail antenna on the back windows. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  I remember I was at BAB 20 years ago.  That's where I met Ant.  And I remember the beeper was huge.  Oh, right.  There you go.  I remember hanging out.  We had to do a lot of club gigs and a lot of just running around Long Island.  And how we communicated with each other was...  I didn't even have a beeper, though.  I never had a beeper.  You had a beeper, right?  I had a beeper.  And you always...  If someone in your crew had a beeper, you hung out with that person a little more.  I don't know why you wouldn't just get your own beeper. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  But he would be the communicator.  Well, that was it.  You'd look and be like, all right, yeah, that's, you know, this guy.  And I remember it was the van driver I used to hang out.  I forgot his name.  And he would always get the beep that the girls were hanging out at such and such place.  The girls.  We'd all get excited.  And then, you know, we'd run over to that place.  But they could have left by then because, you know, there was no way to communicate.  Yeah.  I don't know how we got by. 
[00:02:30]  Doesn't it seem weird and disconnected when you look back at those times?  Like, I don't know how anybody connected with each other or ever spoke.  Had you ever get...  Yeah.  Had you ever hook up to go somewhere, you'd have to plan so far in advance.  Right.  And you had to...  Yeah.  I remember going on dates to the mall and just hoping that the person would show up.  The guy would show up.  Yeah.  Right.  And I was like, where is he?  Yeah.  And you'd have to sit in the bathroom and look for the hole between the two store doors.  Your eyeballs would meet and a tear would form in each one.  But if you were meeting someone, you just had to hope that they were going to be there. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  You just looked it up.  That's my first phone right there.  The StarTac.  It was the Motorola StarTac.  Yes.  That was my first phone.  It came out in 96, so I didn't get a cell phone until 96 then.  After 96.  I know.  We moved to Boston and I still didn't have a cell phone.  And then I got one and that caused problems.  I know we've talked about this.  Yeah, because I wasn't allowed to get one.  But I wasn't allowed to get it.  No.  This is the same guy.  That's what makes me laugh.  Wife wouldn't let me get one.  We both have drastically changed, granted. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, okay.  But I remember getting a cell phone and that just caused problems.  Oh.  And I'm like, I should get a cell phone.  You don't need a cell phone.  She was probably right.  Yeah, probably.  Scroll down a little further.  See what we got as far as the 96.  Is it later?  We got 96.  The Nokia 810.  I didn't have that.  Oh, that was that other slidey one.  Yeah.  The Nokia 9000.  9,000 communicator.  Oh, and then the Nokia 9000, we opened it up and it was sideways, so you had the bigger 
[00:04:00]  keyboard.  Wait, these are phones that came out after the StarTac?  Yeah, this is 98.  Why does the StarTac look cooler than those two phones?  Well, these aren't phones.  These are the two-way pager.  What was a two-way pager?  What was the regular?  It was just texting.  Yeah, it's pretty much you're texting at that point.  The beepers were just like, I think it just showed you a phone number that someone was  calling.  That's all it was, yeah.  And then you had to go to a pay phone.  Go to a pay phone and call the number.  Call the number and they were waiting at that pay phone for you to call it. 
[00:04:30]  You put in codes, though.  Like, you put your phone number in, then you write 143.  Yeah.  That means I love you.  So you're just like, oh, that's so nice.  You never got that one, did you?  I never even had a buber.  Okay.  But the four meant something else.  I used to like to spell out hello on a calculator.  Oh, that's a good one.  What do the other ones look like?  98.  Okay.  The Nokia 9.  What is that one? 
[00:05:00]  The 5-5110.  I don't know.  No, the Nokia above that.  Oh, that is the Nokia 5-110 or whatever.  Who knows?  Yeah.  That's when I started getting into it.  That was like my first phone was kind of a Nokia.  Nokia.  A Nokia.  Yeah.  The leather case you'd have on your side because the phone didn't bend.  It was just this straight hunk of fucking shit.  Of garbage.  Yeah.  That's when everyone would ass-tile people because there wasn't a flip.  Oh, there you go.  That's 99? 
[00:05:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  That's the one I got.  99.  It was a smaller one.  The Nokia 7-1-7.  The 8-2-1-0.  Oh, which way are we going?  8-6.  Okay.  The Nokia 8-2-1-0.  So, that phone everyone would recognize.  That was a big one.  Big seller right there.  Right.  Come on.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  So, you get to my fucking favorite phone of all time.  The Nokia 7-1-1-0.  That's another one.  Keep going.  The Nokia 5210.  Nokia was hot, huh?  Oh, it really was.  Then the Benifon. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, boy.  Isn't it amazing how awful and irrelevant these look?  With the little antenna.  And we finally get to the first Samsung, which brings us to yesterday.  Uh-huh.  Let me see the first Samsung.  That's the first Samsung makes an appearance.  And now they're taking over the world.  The little tiny screens.  And it was the first cell phone you could put MP3s on.  Wow.  Really?  How many could you fit, did it say?  Probably two.  And does it say what year?  Uh, this is 99, I think.  These are all 99 still. 
[00:06:30]  Okay.  Keep going.  What a hassle, yeah.  If texting was, you'd have to hit the same number like three times to get the third letter.  And shit.  Oh, pain.  But shouldn't we all have been just amazed that you could text?  Yeah.  But of course we'd have to all go to bitching right away, right?  I think we were amazed back then, though.  It's only, I remember the first text I sent was from my car.  I was like 30 years old.  Yeah.  The first time I sent it was to a girl, and people were texting, and I was like, no, texting's  annoying.  Now I don't want to hear a voice ever.  Never.  Yeah.  No, it's stupid texting.  Boy.  Make a phone call with your phone. 
[00:07:00]  Do I enjoy a good text?  It's really ridiculous to make a phone call.  When my phone rings, I'm just like, out loud, I go, who is this?  Right.  I'm all annoyed.  Of course.  Should we keep going real fast?  Sure.  I like this.  Then we go to the 2000s.  More Nokias.  Nokia just, what happened to Nokia?  It was all over the place.  They had a huge lead.  iPhone.  Yep.  That killed everything.  Everything.  Maybe the BlackBerry before the iPhone knocked out the Nokia.  Look at all Nokias. 
[00:07:30]  Everyone had those.  The Nokia A310.  And Ericsson.  Where'd they go?  Ericsson was trying to make a move.  Bye-bye.  Ericsson's keep going.  You can go faster now, because it's getting boring for people.  Just waiting.  I can't believe how I forgot these ever existed.  Right.  More Nokias.  Now you're looking at the first.  Stylus.  Stylus.  The Sony.  What is it?  Sony Ericsson P800.  P800.  Okay. 
[00:08:00]  Very Pompey-ish.  I recently lost a lot of money, because I invested in a stylus carrying case company.  Oh, how'd that work on that?  Not well.  I did it like four months ago.  I invested three million.  If I didn't have...  Ah, a flip phone.  First camera phone.  Oh, a camera phone.  Is the Sanyo was the first one?  Mm-hmm.  What year is it?  I think I had that one.  2002.  2002 was the first camera phone.  So we've already been taking pictures with our phones for 12 years.  Wow.  More Nokia.  What the fuck?  What did Nokia do wrong?  Not be Apple. 
[00:08:30]  And then the trio.  That's right.  We all were handed trios when we first joined XM.  Let me tell you a little trivia right about now.  Yeah.  The guy that invented that?  Mm-hmm.  Big man on campus at Harborfield High School.  Oh, that's right.  Not the trio.  The palm.  And his favorite actor was the Palm Trio.  He did both.  No, he did both.  He did the palm and the trio.  Yes, and Danny sued him over the whole name thing.  All right, I'll accept numbers.  The trio.  And the trio.  And the trio.  Oh, God. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  I bomb with phone jokes.  Yes.  I'll accept number three.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Third greatest Harborfield High School graduate.  Well, what's he done for us lately?  Wait, go back.  We missed a few.  Oh, my God.  And then Nokia again.  Nokia, Nokia.  Oh, the BlackBerry Quark.  What year was that?  I remember that.  It looked like a little calculator.  A little monochrome screen.  It was a bit wide.  They went wide at first.  Oh, then the 7210 had a color screen.  And this is where BlackBerry knocked down Nokia. 
[00:09:30]  That's right.  Oh, boy.  But Nokia hanging in there.  What the fuck was that?  It's like a Klingon weapon.  The 7600.  Look up the Nokia 7600 if you're near a computer.  What is that?  It looks like almost like there's all-in-one remote controls in your house.  Like the big ones.  A little screen in the middle.  It's almost square with all the buttons on the outside.  With a screen in the middle.  Oh, the Razor.  But the buttons go all the way around.  The Razor was a cool phone.  That was a cool phone to have.  A Motorola Razor.  Oh, you had to have a Razor.  No, because I decided to go Pebble right around the outside. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, right.  I went with the Pebble.  Yeah, another Sony Ericsson.  Nokia.  Nokia.  Nokia's still hanging in there.  They're trying to stay relevant.  Nokia hanging in there.  Nokia didn't go quietly.  Nokia keep going.  A lot of Nokias.  Keep jiggling.  Nokia's, Nokia's, Nokia's.  We're going faster now.  That is another Razor.  The Razor started taking over a little bit.  Now we're up to 2006.  More Nokias.  Motorola.  BlackBerry Pearl.  Oh.  That stunk.  Wait a minute.  Where's the iPhone? 
[00:10:30]  That came out before 2006.  Yeah.  No.  I don't think so.  No, the iPhone was...  I think the iPhone is still a little newer than that.  Is it?  Remember the Blackjack?  Oh.  The Blackjack.  I realize that.  Right.  More Nokia.  And then 2007.  The world changed.  That's the iPhone.  That's it right there.  There you go.  That was the game changer right there.  And then we...  For the most part, we know.  Everything since then.  Everything since then.  All these other ones were trying to hang in. 
[00:11:00]  Motorola's.  Like, what did Apple do?  Nokia's saying, fuck you.  We've been, you know, a powerhouse for years.  We're just hanging in there.  BlackBerry added typewriter buttons.  Yeah.  Those dumb fucking...  Those assholes.  Intuitive.  Oh.  It was intuitive buttons on the screen.  Oh.  Tactile.  Right.  Because people like to...  Do they?  Do they?  The BlackBerry Bold.  I think that was the last BlackBerry I had.  I had that one.  I said, fuck you, BlackBerry.  Goodbye.  What was the one I had that I tapped on?  When I wanted to switch to Verizon because I hated AT&T, what was the BlackBerry that sent 
[00:11:30]  me into a rage spiral?  Was it the store?  It might have been a store.  The click screen?  That's the click screen one.  The click screen.  What a lousy company.  Tick, tick, tick, tick.  It's like you're popping those packing bubbles.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't text that.  You just couldn't do it.  Yeah.  And then you...  And that's it.  That's pretty much it.  Everything goes away.  What do you think is going to be next when we look back at the iPhone, the way we look  at the Razr and the Pebble?  What will the phones be in 10 years?  Oh, back to the old-style dial phone where you carry it around with you in a suitcase. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, in a backpack.  The new backpack phone.  You'd be hanging up on your head like a hat.  Remember they were trying to, like, go with that old-school handset?  People were walking around with the handset and the curly-cute client that plugged in USB  into your fucking iPhone.  That was a goof, right?  That was a hipster thing, I think.  I think it was a black thing.  A lot of black guys, like, walking around with that.  I don't know.  I'm on a phone, motherfucker.  Check out my phone.  Yeah.  But anyway, it leads us to yesterday's meeting where we all got white glove service. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, boy.  Thanks to Roland.  Oh, yeah.  Roland set it up so the Samsung people came by.  Got a Note.  And gave us the Note.  And a watch.  A Note 3.  And a watch.  And a watch.  Is the Note smaller than it used to be, or is it a different phone?  It's thinner and lighter.  What was the giant screen?  Like, I like that screen size that you're holding.  This is, uh, maybe they made the Note slightly smaller.  I don't know.  But it's still, it's a big phone, but it fits in every pocket. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I want the Samsung 5, but they, uh, because we're white glove now, we will get Samsung  5s as well.  It's so good for video.  But we start with the Note, the Note 3.  Note 3 is, like, the video's amazing.  And Louis from the company came by yesterday.  He was really, really cool.  Because, you know, staying for a meeting for us is brutal.  Yeah.  Our brains literally shut off an hour after this radio show.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what happens, but it just shuts down.  Mentally, you just go somewhere else.  You're done talking. 
[00:13:30]  You're done focusing.  You're done concentrating.  And you just start staring into space.  Staring.  Your eyes start crossing.  Right.  It's crazy.  But he tolerated us, and he showed us around the new, uh, Note 3.  It was cool.  Oh, speaking of which, here's Roland.  Ah, and there's yours, Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, we used to have an appointment.  I'll try to hide it with it.  Oh, thanks.  Roland, come in and give me the watch.  Roland, uh, I see you're wearing the watch.  Yes, white gloves.  White gloves.  White gloves.  Roland held that uncomfortable piece of metal up his ass. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's cold.  Who touched my screen?  Oh.  They did.  They set up the...  Oh, they did.  Thank you.  Okay, cool.  They set up most of the stuff for him.  Yeah, but they just can walk them through like...  Grease McGillicuddy?  Exactly.  Who did this while they're eating KFC?  But, uh, thank you.  I was not expecting this.  I thought I was going to have to go to the meeting first.  Oh, no.  Oh, good.  I can't wait to try this.  Roland, I hear you're very excited about your, uh, Note 3 and your watch.  I am very excited.  It's fun.  But none of it works yet. 
[00:14:30]  Not quite.  So why are you wearing the watch if it doesn't work yet?  It does.  It's, uh, 33 degrees outside.  Oh, you're saying that's an actual watch.  He set it up for the weather and, um...  And the time.  But that's all I know how to do so far.  Yeah.  But you have to set up your phone.  I tried last night and I need some white glove help suit me.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Roland was walking around all day yesterday just going, white gloves.  White gloves.  White gloves.  What's white gloves?  You have to be invited to it. 
[00:15:00]  How were we invited?  Through me.  So we owe you now.  Oh, yes, you do.  Oh, shit.  Suits guests.  Suits guests.  What?  He's trying to book the guys from suits.  He's been trying for two years.  Not that show.  He loves this show and he wants us to take the guys from suits.  Oh.  Well, let me ask you.  Would Roland do the interview?  I mean, we'll just hang out, but would Roland do the interview?  It's not a bad idea.  I don't know them that well and I don't want to give disrespect to them.  We could give you 15 minutes to interview the suits guys.  Yeah.  Oh, white gloves.  White gloves. 
[00:15:30]  White gloves.  Yeah, so.  So we're part of this white glove service and they'll hook us up with all the products  and things?  Whatever you guys need.  This is way better than an envelope.  Oh, yeah.  Although I enjoy a nice, fat envelope every once in a while.  Fat, nice envelope.  Like I said, no envelopes?  This seems to be a little more legal than the envelopes that I may or may not receive from  time to time.  If anything goes wrong or scratches, do they come help you?  Well, I've been a huge Samsung guy for many years now. 
[00:16:00]  I started with the One, so that's a few years back now and I love this Note.  I was kind of disappointed he didn't bring the new Samsung Fives, but then I fooled around  with the Note a little bit and I'm all in.  I love it.  I fucking love it.  I tried the Wi-Fi.  It was super fast.  Yeah, it's really fast.  What I like about the Samsung phones is the media, the video.  I swear to you, I'm not just saying this because I do have iPhones in my house as well, kicks  the iPhone's ass.  Yeah.  The quality of the video and the quality of the pictures. 
[00:16:30]  Most of the pictures I throw up on Instagram is just through my dumb phone.  It's better to watch video on, that's for sure.  You get like really good video.  Taking the video is amazing.  I gave up on bringing cameras in here a while ago because the Samsung video is pretty damn  good.  It's pretty close.  Pretty goddamn good.  How do I make the watch fit better?  I have a little dainty wrist.  Oh, no.  I learned from the white glove band.  Oh, you did?  Jimmy, something tells me you had to let it out. 
[00:17:00]  White gloves.  Someone's white gloves are a little bigger than everyone else's.  Right.  I can still, words hurt, man.  Sorry.  You are a thick-wristed man, Rold.  I know.  You're big-boned.  Yeah, Rold has thick wrists.  Thank you.  They're a problem if you want to be.  Yeah, you have good hooker strangling wrists.  Thank you.  Collapse a trachea with that forearm.  Yeah.  Thank you for making it bigger. 
[00:17:30]  Not a scratch.  I put it on my thighs.  I have wrists like Adrian from Rocky.  And it has a nice little stylus, which you don't have to use ever.  But it does come in handy for some of those little moves or details.  Right.  Like, you could take a picture of yourself and trace around your head and eliminate the  background and put it somewhere else.  Like, there's little photo tricks you could do, which are kind of fun.  And then the other submenu that comes up in the corner for the note ad thing. 
[00:18:00]  And it's pretty goddamn cool, I must say.  If you meet someone and you're writing down their number, you could just quickly write it  on the note and then pop it right into contacts immediately.  And it instantly goes to the, you know, typed out shit in your contacts.  I'm trying to remember what Lewis told us.  Or you could write in the dress down, like, oh, I have to go to, like, I don't know, 400  Madison here in New York.  So you just write it real quick.  Write it really quick.  And then you pop it into Maps.  Maps.  And for Jimmy, for the autographs.  And it pops right up. 
[00:18:30]  Huh?  For the autographs with Jimmy.  Yeah, that's true.  You could take a picture with somebody and then you take the pen and just sign the screen.  And he'll, like, you could have people autograph your digital pictures.  Which is kind of weird, but pretty cool.  He was showing us a bunch from the NBA.  Right.  Yesterday.  It's actually a pretty cool idea.  It was a pretty cool idea.  Until you see them again and get it signed.  Exactly.  It's a cool feature, though.  That's what Jimmy does.  Well, digital signatures are taking over the world.  We all know that.  Oh, boy.  It's the next big thing. 
[00:19:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  Is that what everyone's doing?  Yeah, good luck getting it on a baseball.  That's what I say.  Ah, regular Joe.  But the watch.  Now, I said I would never wear a watch.  And I think I'm not totally in with the watch.  But Louis was showing us the watch.  And it's pretty damn cool.  As long as it's pretty close to the phone.  Yeah.  You could answer phone calls through your watch.  You could receive and answer text messages.  You could read your Twitter.  What else?  You could take pictures off your watch. 
[00:19:30]  Be a little secret agent man if you have to be.  And I kind of liked it.  Now, you've got to be careful if you're in the restroom and you see somebody's arm hanging  down straight right next to you.  Oh, boy.  Click.  Yeah, make sure you give a good presentation.  I've got music, too.  Roland, you're still not showing me how to do the watch.  All you've got to do is just show me how it'll do it.  And the watch is voice.  The picture taken is voice command, too.  So you can just say capture and your camera will go off and take a picture, which is pretty cool.  So I'm not sold totally on the watch, but I definitely kind of liked playing with it yesterday. 
[00:20:00]  It's great for taking a phone call, especially if you're in the car.  Well, then you don't have to worry about the cops.  The old coppers seeing you on the phone.  Right.  And the quality seems really good to talk to the watch.  What are they going to say?  Get off your watch?  Yeah.  Right.  Get off your watch.  Well, thank you to Samsung.  We don't have to give them a huge fucking infomercial here.  But it was pretty cool that Roland got us in this white gloves.  Nice technology.  Or is it a white glove service?  White gloves or white gloves?  White gloves.  White gloves.  White gloves.  I heard white glove.  It's like called the white glove treatment. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  The white glove treatment.  Right.  I've never gotten that before.  No.  Like people try to get the phone number, but you can't unless if you're invited.  Jimmy gets the latex glove treatment.  Cost extra.  It certainly does.  I leave with my hiney cold and wet.  Wow.  So.  Very cold, yeah.  I love techno shit, man.  It's fucking great.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Do you have to plug the watch in?  Yeah, you got to. 
[00:21:00]  Why?  You don't have battery power on that?  I don't know if I do or not.  Yeah, you got to charge.  I'm still trying to learn how to adjust it.  You definitely got to charge the watch.  Like I said, I mean, I'll wear the watch every once in a while.  I don't know if I'm going to be a day-to-day watch user.  Because the phone itself does everything.  You don't need the watch.  It's just a little add-on.  It's kind of good because the phone is large.  It's a larger phone.  So if you don't want to be taking it out of your pocket or you have it in your jacket pocket or something like that, you could just use the watch to text and look at the text. 
[00:21:30]  I was checking out the options with the camera and the video.  Wow.  Pretty cool.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  The panorama.  Yeah.  The 360.  Yeah, the panorama and the 360 shots are amazing.  Hey, can you face the watch in towards you?  Because I think that, can the numbers go up and then take selfies with your watch?  I guess if you turn it around.  You have to break your arm and then.  It's not convenient to do that.  This would be your selfie.  Yeah.  You would look like you have cerebral palsy if you're trying to get a selfie. 
[00:22:00]  Or you could probably, yeah, you could turn it upside down and then it would be facing you.  I don't know.  It's not the greatest camera on the watch, but it certainly is usable.  Yeah, yeah, I'm right here.  Oh.  I can't hear you because I have no earpieces.  Secret agent.  You need an earpiece.  How do you listen?  There's a speaker on it.  Hello.  You know, I can never have my phone on speakerphone because my conversations all have the potential to shame me.  Oh, that's true.  This is nice.  I actually, I'm going to wear this.  Is it on?  Do you get a...  No, I don't. 
[00:22:30]  Do you have a little watch?  I don't turn watches on.  Oh, right.  I don't know how to turn them on.  I think I'm...  Your watch isn't on?  No, it's probably going to be plugged in a little bit.  Maybe at the battery.  Did you try turning it on?  No.  Because I was ready to make a...  Oh, yeah.  It's on.  It is on?  There's a circle happening.  I'm watching TV on my watch.  Oh, there it is.  It's saying Samsung.  And then you could program in the different faces.  Are you...  You could use the selection and have different faces for the watch.  A regular dial watch or digital.  Or you just have the time and then the weather.  30 degrees.  You got time and weather. 
[00:23:00]  It's pretty cool.  I like it.  Oh, oh, oh.  Who are you calling?  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, wait a minute.  What?  What are you doing?  I'm getting a call.  Hello?  Hello?  Jimmy, is that you?  Yeah.  I'm calling you for my watch.  Lose my number.  You're supposed to answer it through your watch.  No, no.  You called my iPhone.  Yeah.  My Samsung's not hooked up yet, so... 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  The iPhone, I couldn't...  Oh, that stinks.  Yeah, that works.  I wanted you to answer...  I wanted you to answer your watch.  Put it in rain.  Oh, all right.  My watch is broken.  It says 928 AM.  Yeah, that's...  That was a problem.  That was what mine said, too.  They're not good with time over there at Samsung.  Yeah.  You've got to get on the network first.  Yeah.  On Wi-Fi, and then say, here's my location...  You know, set by location.  I was like, I didn't think it was actually broken.  Oh, no.  I was very upset about that yesterday.  It's like, it's not 930. 
[00:24:00]  I was just kidding.  Yeah.  I like...  My watch, typically, just so I get up on time, is two hours and 22 minutes off forever.  Is that it?  It works.  All these amazing features, and Ant was obsessed with the fact that...  My time.  His time wasn't right.  The time wasn't right.  Oh, no.  And then Roland's just walking around with this technology, not hooked up.  Upside down.  He's saying, white gloves all day.  I'll be hooked up soon.  Right, Sam?  He was doing exactly that, right?  Yeah.  He came in, like, bragging about it, and we were like, oh, what can you do?  And he was like, well, it's like a tablet.  And we're like, oh, but it's a phone? 
[00:24:30]  And he goes, yeah, but I don't have the phone part hooked up.  Uh-huh.  And he goes, it's nothing, then.  Like, he's, like, bragging about his watch, but if you scroll through the options, every single  one of them you push, and it just says, not connected to network.  Oh, Christ.  I don't know why he's wearing it.  I don't know either.  Why not?  It's just to brag.  How do I change the face?  I like this.  What?  Through here.  This is like a Spaceman watch.  Through the phone.  Do you like the actual watch?  Yeah.  It's weird feeling something on my wrist.  It's been a while since I've worn a watch.  That's how I know a picture of me is old. 
[00:25:00]  If I see a watch.  Yeah.  If I say watch again, hit me in the mouth.  Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.  I'm saying watch a lot.  Watch, watch, watch.  But I kind of like it.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of.  This is what I'm going to do.  Ask me a question.  Hey, Jim.  I can't talk right now.  I'm looking at the time.  Oh, see.  That might mix things up.  I'm practicing my watch talk.  Inconvenient.  This is very nice.  I want to learn how to use this stuff.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  That was a fun day.  That's what we did for an hour after the show yesterday.  That was quite enjoyable. 
[00:25:30]  And I didn't even fall asleep.  No.  You know me after the show meetings.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  You can't change the face here?  No, you got to use the actual phone.  And then you get little options.  It's good.  You can go with the dial.  Different colors.  You can do it through here.  It's pretty cool.  You can?  Yeah, I did it through here.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know how I did it now, but I'll be.  I think maybe just, let me see.  Roland just got a text message.  I don't know.  While he's wearing the watch, he had to pull his iPhone out of his pocket.  Oh, see.  Look at that.  He just has the watch. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, this outdoor watch.  Is the watch even turned on?  Yes.  It's very.  Okay.  All right.  That's what he did.  He came in.  Like, I just, this morning.  Right.  It's like 5 o'clock in the morning.  Right.  For some reason, Roland's already here.  Uh-huh.  And I walked into the office, and he goes, Sam, Sam.  I go, yeah?  And he goes, outside, it's 33 degrees.  Is it a chance of snow?  That's snowing.  I don't know how you do it.  It's amazing who you know in this town.  He knows, he's friends with the Kronach guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's coming soon.  I think the Kronach guy's scared of him. 
[00:26:30]  Like, he sees Roland lurking outside his window like a monster.  And he's like, it's in a, the relationship is exactly like Kramer and the Soup Nazi.  Like, the Soup Nazi, everyone was afraid of him.  He hated everybody.  Yeah.  And if you ordered wrong, you got thrown out.  Like, he doesn't even let celebrities go up the line and stuff like that.  He's like, no, get back in the line.  But then Kramer would just lean against the wall and have chats with him.  Right.  About that.  And the Soup Nazi would be like, Kramer, you understand me.  That's how you are with the Kronach guy. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I understand his pain.  You understand his pain, right?  I don't think the Kronach guy has any friends, really.  He has Roland.  Yeah.  It's very strange to me.  He's coming next week to bring you his new Kronachs and desserts.  And a cookie shot.  I hope it's during the week so I can enjoy it, because I don't want to miss that.  April 1st.  He's coming in.  April 1st?  That's, you're lying to us.  April 1st.  You're going to do an April Fool's thing on us.  No, I'm not.  Actually, that's the day he's coming in.  You know the word went out to all the radio stations?  Did you see that tweet yesterday? 
[00:27:30]  Uh-uh.  Forgot what company, but they all have to warn their radio show hosts about their April Fool's jokes.  Oh, my God.  And they have to, like, tell the company what they plan on doing for April Fool's.  Oh, boy.  And then they have to, you know.  That was from here?  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  Just in the regular radio world.  Oh.  But we absolutely have a lot to do with that.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe I can find the tweet.  People get that. 
[00:28:00]  They've got to approve all radio shows' ideas for April Fool's.  April Fool's jokes.  Yeah.  One other thing about Roland, which is amazing.  Do you have your Phil Jackson jersey yet?  You mean Michael Vick?  Oh, you want with Michael Vick?  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  What happens with Roland, any big sports news in New York City especially, he goes out and gets the jersey immediately, wears it for two or three days, and then you never see it again.  Why do you wear it?  Because I get high fives in the summer, like, yeah.  Yeah, you're going to get high fives, all right. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, someone goes, Knicks, I'm like, yeah, we're going to do it.  People are going to hate you.  But Roland really doesn't watch any of these sports.  No.  But, like, you know.  I do enjoy football.  When the Nets move.  Oh, you do enjoy football.  You're right.  When the Nets moved to Brooklyn, he was in here with a Brooklyn Nets jersey for two days.  Oh, the Brooklyn Nets.  He had the fucking, what's his name?  The T-ball.  The Asian kid there.  Lynn.  Yeah.  Lynn Sanity.  He was part of Lynn Sanity.  For two days.  It's all about two, maybe three days tops.  And then, where do these shirts and jerseys go? 
[00:29:00]  And I got my Marlon St. Louis gear for the Rangers.  Everybody, like, high-fiving me by the garden.  Because he just got traded.  You just like the attention?  Yeah.  Like, yeah, woo.  What do you think the Michael Vick jersey will get you, though?  I think a lot of people are going to be like, boo, you fucking dog hater.  We should give him a chance, bro.  They go, yeah, let's give him a chance.  Give him a chance.  I don't know.  You guys didn't really watch Olympic hockey, but when Sochi did what he did, he came in  here with a Sochi jersey for two days, but that's gone now.  That's gone.  They didn't even have it, probably. 
[00:29:30]  He was an America's hero.  He was an America's hero for a day.  One day.  And Roland certainly had the shirt to prove it.  Do you still have the shirts, or are you throwing them out?  It's retired.  It's retired.  But he retires the jersey up into the rafters in his attic.  But you've got the Michael Vick sports page today in the Daily News.  Top dog.  Top dog.  Get it.  Get it.  He killed dogs.  Vick says, I think I'm still a starting quarterback, and Rex Ryan says he might just be right, and  then it says, top dog. 
[00:30:00]  How old is Mark Sanchez?  Wasn't he supposed to be the franchise?  Is he 30, even?  Early 30s.  No.  Is he 30 or 20?  No, man.  He's still in his 20s.  He has to be.  I would guess if I had to.  He's 27.  I was going to say 28.  Okay, yeah.  He was the franchise quarterback, right?  He was the franchise.  Damn.  They said that?  Of course they did.  Is he officially on the Eagles?  No.  Oh, okay.  Your rumor has the Eagles going to pick him up, and I bet you he does really well.  Is he sane?  Now that he's out of New York. 
[00:30:30]  What song would he sing if he did?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Right.  I know he's not happy that the Jets released them.  No.  But maybe he should just get over it.  Pitching a fit.  He should be pitching a football.  Right?  Get it?  Something like that.  I'm surprised you didn't get a Phil Jackson jersey for the Knicks there.  All right.  Well, he's in the front office.  They're going to sell.  Front office guy.  Just get a suit jacket.  Yeah, he'll come in with a suit jacket on. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  For a day.  Fucking.  It's Roland's thing, though.  He loves fitting in with fellow New Yorkers.  Support the team.  On the subway to get high-fived for a day.  You're a weirdo.  You're a weirdo when you go down and get your cronut.  Delicious.  I was talking about him on the way home.  He gets things done, though, this Roland.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know how you do it.  He's big on that.  He's big on getting things done.  You're well connected, sir.  Way more connected than maybe we should be. 
[00:31:30]  We don't know anybody after all these years.  No, we should have.  I don't know anyone.  Everyone we knew had to shun us.  Yeah, I don't have any of these big connections like Roland has.  You have to be shunned.  If I want a cronut, I have to go through Roland.  I can't just call the cronut guy myself.  And you've been there.  Dude, I went down there once.  Let me tell you something.  I mean, the cronut is excellent.  I've had it a couple times.  But, I mean, it doesn't do his place justice.  It's more than just the cronut.  There is so much good stuff going on in that place. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, it's a great place to bring your woman.  Maybe she's celebrating something.  You get a little table in the back and get a sample of all his desserts.  They're amazing.  Yeah, he's the number four baker in the world.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Who the hell's number?  Yeah, let's get the other three.  What are we doing number four?  They're overseas.  Greg Opie Hughes, number one.  Ooh, am I?  They're all overseas.  I can't think he looks at the wiki and he's like, oh.  I'm number four.  Is he the number one baker in the country?  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  But he doesn't make money still.  He sells out of everything.  But he should just say, fuck it, and make 10,000 cronuts a day.  Only 200 cookies.  That's it.  He's only going with 200 cookies?  Are they lining up for the cookies now?  At 10 a.m.  They're lining up, and there's already, he said last Friday was like 2,000 people.  Enzo was number one.  He said, I had just 200 cookies.  Do you guys understand how hard that is to have a bake shop and then have people lining  up every day still?  It's been over a year for the corona, right?  And the funny part, one of his mentors who taught him when he first came to New York, 
[00:33:00]  has a bakery shop like four blocks away, and the line goes around it every day.  It goes around it.  It passed his mentor.  So now you wait in line for the cookie thing and the cronaut?  Yeah, two different times.  The cookie thing is a shot glass made out of chocolate chip cookie, and then they pour  milk in it.  His own milk, infused.  What do you mean his own milk?  What does he do with it?  On the farm, he has, they make the milk just for him.  What's different about his milk?  It's so delicious. 
[00:33:30]  It's infused with vanilla in it.  What?  It's infused with vanilla.  Yeah, his cows are treated pretty well.  So when are we going to try this stuff?  April 1st.  They're lying.  April 1st is the April Fool's date, then.  I know, but he's coming in the April 1st to bring.  I bet he's not.  I think he's just setting us up for a big April Fool's break.  And he only sells the cookies at 3 p.m.  Someone's going to come in with Entenman in him.  Ew.  Those are pedestrian foods.  I love a good Entenman's chocolate chip cookie, though.  I do.  You give me an Entenman's chocolate chip cookie, and I'm, and I'm, I can't think of anything 
[00:34:00]  I'm going to do, but I enjoy it.  I'm happy.  People are confused.  Like, someone tweeted a picture that, I found it finally, and it was Entenman's, but it  was the donuts.  No, man, it's the classic Entenman's coffee cake that I love.  No fancy coffee cake, no chocolate swirl, no, none of it, just fucking coffee cake.  Not double crumbs and all that other crap they've done.  I think you have to special order those.  The original basic Entenman's coffee cake.  You can't find them?  It's so good.  It's hard to find, because they, they had to fancy it up, and like Ann said, there's chocolate 
[00:34:30]  drizzle on it now, or double crumb and caramel.  That's what the parents used to get when they went over to company.  Go over to company's house.  Right.  Get that coffee cake.  Or a nice vodka.  That was my, I used to do a lot of skiing, and I would always get, like, Entenman's classic  coffee cake, and eat, I'm not even exaggerating, half of it in the morning, just keep cutting  off slices, and just keep going.  Can't stop myself with that.  So good.  I actually want to open a bakery and compete with this guy, because I think that he does  things that I would have probably done years ago, and I think I've just moved past him. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's, he stole my idea, basically, because I had the idea for the cookie.  The cookie?  Yeah, but it's called the lima beaner.  And it's, you might have made a mistake there.  Because lima beans are very mashable, and I...  So lima beans are hats.  No, I mash lima beans into a semi-circle, and I fill them with milk, and I allow it to  curdle for five days outside, and then you can drink the lima bean mash.  The curdled lima bean mash? 
[00:35:30]  Are they lining up for that, Jimmy?  I haven't sold it yet.  I just want to eat them all myself.  They're so delicious.  Oh, tasty.  So he gets two lines every day now.  Yeah.  He gets the Cronut line in the morning.  Like, people are lined up right now, right?  Yeah, around 4.30 in the morning, they line up.  Come on.  Seriously, yeah.  Till what time?  And then he opens his door.  When's the last Cronut sold, about?  9.30, 10 a.m.  So...  An hour and a half at last, maybe.  And he only sells how many Cronuts?  If you don't know it, two per person.  But how many? 
[00:36:00]  300 he's up to now.  Oh, so he's moving the number up slightly?  Ah.  He has a 24-7 crew.  That he goes 24-7.  He's not making enough money.  You know, I mean, Dunkin' Donuts and all these other places that ripped him off are  making a shitload off his invention.  They're a nut.  Buck is art.  But people don't care.  It's good enough for them.  Right.  And they're making so much money.  Yeah.  But he trademarked the Cronut name.  He owns it.  But he's got to figure out a better way to make money off this thing.  Yeah.  He probably makes enough money on this. 
[00:36:30]  He's got to make money on something.  Yeah.  I mean...  He does well.  The bakery does extremely well.  But...  Yeah.  How much can a bakery make in the end?  Everybody wants him to go bigger and he won't.  Right.  Yeah.  But his shelf life, he's going to go away eventually.  And then what does he have?  He didn't make the money when he had a chance to make it.  He's creating a new dessert soon.  Another new one.  Another new one.  See, which one's going to be the flop?  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Snow pea extravaganza.  Yeah.  It's a chocolate bar with snow peas hammered into it. 
[00:37:00]  He hasn't so far, though.  He did a Christmas cereal was a hit.  What was that one?  So, why doesn't he get a company that, you know, gets some of this in the supermarkets?  He said the quality.  He won't do it.  He's an idiot.  I think he has.  He's got to have one.  I like the guy.  I've met him a bunch of times.  He's such a nice guy.  But...  Business sense.  It seems like he could be just, you know, cashing it in.  He doesn't care about the money, he said.  Wow.  He's not the quality.  He's Pennywise and Dollar Foolish.  He is. 
[00:37:30]  And then the chocolate chip shot glass milk thing.  That line starts at 3, 3.30 in the afternoon?  No, that line starts at 10 a.m.  Right after the Cronaut thing is done?  The line starts wrapping around.  That's amazing.  So, I walk past the line.  I go, ooh, bye, people.  Right.  And I go, enjoy my delicious treats.  Wow.  Celebratory treats.  What are you celebrating?  That I could walk past the line.  It's just good.  It's just good. 
[00:38:00]  Vicious cycle.  All right.  But he's bringing Nutella bread for you guys, too.  It's delicious.  What's that?  It's having Nutella in his special bread.  He makes bread with Nutella in it?  Yes.  It's like a marble rye?  Better.  Is he ripping off the Nutella people, or is he making his own Nutella bag?  He adds extra stuff in the Nutella.  Oh.  Delicious.  No, that's not good.  My bread is better.  What is it, Jim?  I bake bread, and I put raw roast beef in it. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Then what?  I curl it into a baseball, and you're supposed to play catch with it and harden it, and then  eat it.  You're a terrible chef.  You don't like my roast beef bread ball idea?  No.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'll do some other things.  Certainly.  Yes.  Hey, yo, doctor, here's another proper track, and it's fat, watch the sniper, time to paint 
[00:39:00]  the paper, and let that real shit provoke, so you still want to be low, then you can  smoke, then I hope that your fans at the stand.  Easy, right?  Hell, yeah.  The same records that you're making is playing me, motherfuck Dre, motherfuck Snoop.  And liked N-W-A-L-I.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know much about it at the time. 
[00:39:30]  And then we learned recently, Eazy-E, it wasn't even meant to rap, really.  Real motherfucking cheese.  Remember Ice Cube telling us that?  Yeah.  Was it Ice Cube?  It was Ice Cube, right?  Ice Cube.  Ice Cube.  Ice Cube.  All the confidence in the world.  That's the best part of it.  I know.  Hey, Ice Cube.  You're Ice Cube.  Fuck.  Fuck me.  Uh, 19 years ago, we lost the Eazy-E.  Wow. 
[00:40:00]  He would have, uh, he would have only been 50 years old.  Damn.  He would be an old OG, though.  He'd be an OG.  Right.  He'd probably be on one of those fucking CSI shows.  Something.  Whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  He'd be on Dance with the Stars.  Yeah, something like that.  Are you kidding?  What else happened?  Oh, remember that Heaven's Gate thing?  Marshall White Apple, or no?  Yeah, right?  It was, right? 
[00:40:30]  I'm guessing.  They found the bodies of the 39 Heaven's Gate members 17 years ago.  Were those the Nike guys?  Yeah.  Right?  Yep.  That was them.  And they had to put a thing over their heads, too.  Didn't they have to put some kind of...  Yeah.  What was it?  Some kind of blue cloth or some kind of...  I thought it was purple.  Purple.  Right, right.  What was it, though?  A purple blanket?  Yeah, I think it was a purple blanket.  Yeah, they had to put purple blankets on their heads, as well, or something.  And what?  They were waiting for the spaceship behind the comet? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, Hellbop.  Hellbop.  Oh, that's right.  Hellbop.  I haven't thought about this stuff in years.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think radio stations did do that.  Yeah.  What'd they do?  A little parody.  I think they did Hellbop.  Hellbop.  Instead of Mbop.  Oh, boy.  I think Anthony's right.  I vaguely remember something like that.  And then the Mike Tyson guy went to prison for six years for rape.  22 years ago.  Wow.  How many years did he serve?  I think he served three, right?  If I remember my readings. 
[00:41:30]  That Mike Tyson book we haven't talked about in a while.  What an amazing book if you're looking for something to read.  That's shit insane.  Incredibly honest in his book.  By the way, Eric's telling me that Todd did a Hellbop song.  He did.  Todd?  Yeah.  Can we find it?  He says he doesn't have the clip, but he remembers it.  Well, how about we find it?  It's topical today.  Maybe we can find it.  How is the Todd show doing?  We haven't checked in in a while.  It's probably really good, though.  I've not heard it, but I hear it's amazing.  We might have to check in soon. 
[00:42:00]  What do you guys think?  Yeah, I'd like to see what they're doing.  Should we check in soon?  What the heck?  We should.  I know Scott Shannon's just kicking ass for CBS FM.  CBS.  Leaving him alone.  Oh, yeah.  He's a good egg.  We've turned the corner on Scott Shannon.  Yeah.  Nothing but support for him.  Well, let's take a look at the Todd show soon.  Maybe tomorrow or Friday.  We've given him some time to settle in.  Right.  Remember that April Fool's thing that I just said about regular radio?  Yeah.  So, it's our old pal Rover, Rover Radio, on Twitter. 
[00:42:30]  Uh-huh.  He writes, Saskeith, I think his name is, sent this early April Fool's joke to all shows.  Oh.  And then he writes, he tweets, he says, don't worry, our gunman, our gunman Lucet station  bid is still on.  And what the management sent is this, to Rover and a lot of other radio shows.  Who did Rover write that to?  He just tweeted it.  Oh.  He's pissed.  You can tell.  Good for Rover. 
[00:43:00]  Still fighting the good fight on regular radio.  Trying.  So, this guy, Keith Abrams, Cleveland Radio, all talent.  So, they own a whole bunch of stations up there in Cleveland.  Yeah.  So, this went out to their entire...  All the air staff.  All the air staff.  Thank you, man.  And producers and everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Right.  Folks, just a reminder that with April 1st, one week away, all April Fool's bits must  be cleared with your PD before anyone would execute. 
[00:43:30]  Thanks, Keith Abrams.  We hear it.  And there you have it.  Hi, we'd like to do something.  Then again, I think we had a lot to do with this, I think.  We had everything to do with it.  Yikes.  But that was the fun of April Fool's.  You would try to sneak one past.  It was your audience.  Yeah.  And your program director.  You never told the program director what you were doing?  He would fuck it up.  Always, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you just came up with the idea and did it.  Right.  Well, we did the mayor's prank almost, I guess, 16 years coming up in a week. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  You know, remember Dave Douglas coming in.  Sam, you might want to listen to this.  You love Dave Douglas stories.  Dave.  We started the mayor's prank.  It's going really well.  Yeah.  And then Dave, in a panic, comes running in.  He's like, you go on the air and tell them this is an April Fool's joke.  Me and Anthony look at each other like, yeah, all right, man.  Yeah, we've got a few songs to play.  Don't you worry about it.  He goes, okay, you're going to do it, right? 
[00:44:30]  I'm like, yeah.  He believed you?  Yes.  Because you guys were buddies?  Another half hour goes by and we really hammer the bit home by having a fake news report  from one of my old buddies that I don't think I've ever named on the show because I protected  his fucking career.  And then he comes running in again.  I told him.  I told him.  Ah, Dave, we're going to do it.  We got this.  Relax.  And then right to sign off.  It was time.  And I think he was at the door.  Yeah, he was very angry.  And at sign off, we're like, well, keep listening to the station to see what the latest is on 
[00:45:00]  this.  And we never set a table.  You just lied to him.  Let it hang there, yeah.  The cold stares we got.  You believe that dummy tried to run in and would have saved your jobs?  I know, right?  What an idiot.  Asshole.  Oh, no.  It was the best thing we ever did.  Thank God.  We needed out of there.  Hindsight.  To become big radio stars.  Oh, yeah.  What did he say at the end of the show?  I wish I completely remembered.  I know we got a good talking to. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Guys.  But then it ended up pretty much our last show.  We were allowed to come back the next day before it got real ugly.  Then it just was real bad.  We always get to do the show after the bad show.  Because they're not sure what's going on yet.  And then everyone got pissed at us that we kind of blew up our spot and left.  Yeah.  So we had a good thing going up there with the radio station.  Whatevs.  That's what I say.  Whatevs.  Fuck yeah.  They weren't paying us.  Remember, I kept going to those guys going, look, we're ready to be syndicated. 
[00:46:00]  And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, all right.  Watch what we do next.  Watch what we do now.  We already had meetings in New York.  Hell, yeah.  On the QT.  Yeah, we had been down here already.  Right.  So, all right, man.  You know.  Yeah.  That was after the big negotiation where Bruce Mittman slid the paper over to show us  that he was going to give us, I think it was a $2,000 raise or something.  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  Even though our competition who we were kicking there, we were kicking everyone's ass, they  were making like, what, three or four times more than us? 
[00:46:30]  At least.  And this asshole, and I love him dearly.  I was just thinking about him yesterday.  And he actually pushes the little paper over to show us our raise at a Chinese buffet.  Like they do in the movies.  And Anthony, God bless you.  I just started laughing.  Just laughs in his face.  Because usually that would have been my job.  And it was like, you've got to be shitting me.  And I was like, oh, really?  I just started laughing.  Then I'm like, all right.  Ridiculous.  We now know what we have to do.  And then Dave Douglas had to separate me and Ant. 
[00:47:00]  He knows I'm extremely competitive.  So he separates me from Ant to go, it's too bad that, you know, you guys aren't going to sign.  Because, you know, doing so well against BCN and everything.  Be a real shame.  He's such a dick.  What a fucking loser.  And then we had to sign because we didn't have anything officially yet.  And then April Fool's came around and we said, all right.  That's it.  There's the door.  There you go.  We're going to go out in style.  But then we told the boys in New York, we're like, good news. 
[00:47:30]  We're no longer under contract with those guys.  Yeah.  But remember, they didn't want to touch us at first.  And we're like, oh, fuck.  Like, you lay low.  What do we do?  And they're like, ah, we've got to lay low a little bit to see how this fucking plays out.  Yeah.  And then, long story short, we had two radio stations here in New York that wanted us.  And they sort of fought over us for a little while.  That was kind of nice.  That works.  And now, you know, fast forward and no one even gives a fuck about us around here. 
[00:48:00]  Nice little.  I do.  Thank you, Seth.  Like you said, no one gives a fuck.  I hear you.  It's implying you're no one.  I know.  Accurately.  What I do find strange is they don't care if we have really good shows or really bad  shows.  They just don't care.  No.  I guess it's because people are already signed up or something.  Yeah.  It's a product that we're giving to the people that are already, you know, signed up.  Yeah.  So.  I tried to suggest some stuff for L.A., but that's just not going to happen. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe Louisiana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Just let go.  Keep up your good nature.  So, regular radio.  Well, they can't do April Fool's pranks.  Or anyway, they can't do the good ones.  We weren't the only ones that did a good April Fool's prank.  There's some good ones out there.  You would always hear from a radio station here and there that did an amazing April Fool's  prank that got everyone in a panic or talking.  Got everyone rattled up.  You're just not going to get that anymore.  What was some of them April Fool's pranks?  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:00]  Bring Eric in.  He would probably know all of them.  The tunnels flooded.  Oh, yeah.  The tunnels flooded.  UFO?  No, volcano.  It was a big one.  Volcano?  Like the town had a volcano that was about to erupt that no one knew about.  And it was always whatever hill is in your little town, whatever it's called.  Ronnie B. had such a good one last year.  That was a good one.  What did he do?  He got on the air live but presented the entire thing as a best of. 
[00:49:30]  Had Eastside Dave in.  The whole thing.  It sounded like an old show.  And he kept bringing up things that listening in hindsight.  It's like, oh, my God.  That does wind up happening.  Like naming who won the Super Bowl and things like that.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Because he was live.  Right.  It was really a great idea.  I've got to go listen to that.  Yeah, I listened to it.  It's really good.  We should do that.  No, Chip.  We can't do that.  We can't do it now.  If you said it. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, Chip is the worst.  It's so embarrassing.  I did a good trick last year.  For what?  Apple Falls.  Oh, okay.  I put mud in everyone's coffee cup.  Look, it's coffee.  Did they drink it?  Apple Falls?  He never gives any answer.  He just says April Falls.  You don't think he's good at it?  No.  All of his Apple Falls things suck. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  No one would fall for him.  Let's say hi to Maddie, it looks like, in Georgia.  Maddie.  Good morning, guys.  Hi, Maddie.  Oh, I know you.  You call from time to time.  What's up?  Well, back in 1997, when I was living in Florida, the gunman in the studio, April Full Joke,  Bubba the Love Sponge did that when he was working at the PowerPig 93.3.  Did what?  The gunman in the studio, where a gunman's hook came in and shot him and killed him. 
[00:51:00]  That's pretty good.  Wow.  All right.  I respect that.  That's a brutal one.  I like that.  Yeah.  That wasn't true.  I don't know where we're at with Bubba the Love Sponge these days, but, you know, the  guy definitely had a few good bits over the years.  A gunman.  Yeah.  I like that.  You guys have a good day.  Thanks.  I got him so bad on Twitter a few months back.  It was my fucking oak line and sinker.  That was a good one.  I tweeted something like, hey, man, you know, DM me. 
[00:51:30]  I got some, I got to talk to you.  And he was all excited on Twitter that we were finally going to talk.  And basically.  It was about, what, coming here or something?  No, I didn't say any of that.  I just said no.  I just wanted to talk to you.  He thought.  And he was so excited.  He started following me.  And then I just wrote, hey, man, when are you going to fucking DM me?  You know?  And then he tweets, I DM'd you.  What?  What's going on?  He had to admit to all his fan base that I just fucking got him bad. 
[00:52:00]  I don't even hate the guy.  I've never even met the guy, to be honest with you.  Whatever.  Let's say hi to Bobby in Kentucky.  Bobby.  Hey, boys.  There you go.  Before we get to checking in on the Todd show, let's see what the boys are doing at  WAAF with Elmo.  I want an explanation, please.  What do you mean?  I don't know what you mean.  Oh, it's just a little bit that we own it plus Elmo.  I don't know.  Who met Elmo?  Huh?  You guys met Elmo?  Well, sure we did. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, we did.  When?  It was a different time.  Chris, did you have that?  It was a different time.  Is it good?  People at my house don't understand why I would post these things.  They're like, why would you do this to yourself?  I don't know why.  It's from Real Rock TV back in, I think, 98, 97.  Fuck yeah.  When we were doing a little TV show through the radio station.  And we actually were trying to write bits and stuff.  And this is the clip I've been trying to find for a while.  I have every Real Rock TV show on VHS. 
[00:53:00]  Where was this?  I don't know.  I'm trying to think whose house this was.  It's paneling.  It might have been like Ian's house.  The cameraman slash producer of Real Rock TV.  And it opens up with a, you know.  Elmo.  A shot of Elmo.  Do you really want to see this?  More than I want to take my next breath.  I really think Rich Voss should be here.  It's only fair.  Well, you know.  But we have it up.  I love Voss and I want Voss for everything.  But I don't want to wait for Rich.  All right.  I want to enjoy this. 
[00:53:30]  I'll tweet it, by the way, so you can see it yourself.  I'll tweet it right now.  Have you seen it?  Right now.  No, this is not going to be good.  You don't think so?  You didn't see it?  No, I didn't click it last night.  You didn't click it?  No.  It was just too much.  Did your wife ask why you do this stuff?  Oh, yeah.  She heated up.  She got really embarrassed.  She got embarrassed for it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it just makes me very happy.  She didn't think it was a good clip?  Oh, no.  Not at all.  Not at all. 
[00:54:00]  I'm tweeting it right now.  So my Twitter is Opie Radio.  Radio.  Thanks.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sammy.  Okay.  It's Opie.  Oh, hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're hanging out with Elmo this afternoon.  Pause.  Got to explain.  We already started beating up Elmo.  A couple of elbows and fists to the head.  Yeah.  He sees me and Elmo right now because Ant's working Elmo.  I think someone punched it and now Elmo is sitting next to Blythe Danner. 
[00:54:30]  And people don't believe me.  Last night, just before I decided to call it a day, I tweeted this and said, all right,  I am turning off my Twitter and I'm now hiding.  So have fun with this clip.  I don't even know what they tweeted.  Maybe I'll go back and read something later.  Whatever.  And they got a Newberry Comics t-shirt on.  Oh, yeah.  Look at you, man.  Because not only are you cool, but you're local. 
[00:55:00]  That's right.  It's in Boston.  That's right.  Oh, hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're hanging out with Elmo this afternoon, watching a little TV.  Elmo?  Uh, Elmo.  Yes?  Are you having fun?  Oh, I can't.  Oh, the mic in his face.  Don't do that to Elmo no more.  What'd you say?  I can't.  Shove the mic in his mouth.  It's very abusive.  Anyways, we're teaching Elmo some new, like, words this afternoon, like stink fist. 
[00:55:30]  Stink fist.  Stink fist.  I learned a new word.  Am I on a stink fist?  Anthony's lips are moving.  Yeah, they certainly are.  I figured it out.  Oh, boy.  I will say this.  That's not our fault.  No.  They should have taken care of that in post.  In post, right.  Yeah, with a bowling ball or a fist.  So far, this is not bad, though.  Because you're shoving the mic in his face, it's okay.  We're being mean to him.  Yeah.  That's the bit.  It's all right.  We're going to torture Elmo for the day.  Yeah.  That's the bit.  Torture Elmo for the day. 
[00:56:00]  Torture Elmo, right.  Oh, it's not bad.  So far.  All right.  So let's move on.  Honestly, no.  So we should move on, I guess.  I want to see the rest.  But I mean, so far.  You're saying it's not bad.  So we don't need to see.  I didn't like the punching.  But the fact that you're asking questions and then you're shoving the mic in his face obnoxiously.  All right.  I can live with that.  Okay.  What else are you going to do with it?  It's a fucking puppet.  You know, we might as well keep playing it, because so far we're doing good.  Steamfist.  Steamfist.  I learned a new word.  Elmo learned Steamfist.  Hey, Elmo.  You want to play with me and Anthony today?  What are we going to play?  We thought we'd start with Chernobyl. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, that's a fun game for Elmo.  What are you playing?  Follow us.  We'll show you, okay?  Okay.  Oh, we're playing Chernobyl.  All right, we're going to go play Chernobyl with Elmo.  Hey, Elmo, you want to play Chernobyl?  Yeah, do you want to play Chernobyl?  I thought you were going to stay on the couch.  No, no.  Why would we do that?  You went somewhere?  All right, are you going to play Chernobyl?  Well, Chernobyl was, you know, hot back then.  Sure.  So to speak.  Yes.  You know, it was a big story, so we figured we'd work an entire Elmo bit.  What's wrong with that, Jim Norton?  Nothing at all, actually. 
[00:57:00]  Okay, so far so good.  Where are you?  What location is this?  I don't know.  I don't even remember.  Okay.  I don't remember this.  I don't know whose house this is.  It wasn't mine or Anthony's, that's for sure.  Not that we were living any better than wood paneling.  I didn't have any cool wood paneling like that at the end.  I think I would have liked wood paneling back then.  The fucking Brazilian condo complex I was living in.  The Haitian fucking...  Oh, my God.  All right.  Play Chernobyl! 
[00:57:30]  All right, we're going to go play Chernobyl with Elmo.  Hey, Elmo, you want to play Chernobyl?  Yeah, do you want to play Chernobyl?  No, I don't want to play no more.  It looked very scary.  Oh, it's not going to be scary.  It's going to be fun.  I'm actually...  It actually made me laugh.  I kind of like how you hit him with the microphone.  The way you're presenting him with the microphone is actually making me laugh.  Oh, God.  You just clunked him in the face.  Yeah, you just smashed it in his face and then put it in his mouth.  We can answer.  Being very abusive with the microphone.  Yeah.  It's not going to be scary.  It's going to be fun.  We're going to have lots of fun today.  No, I'm afraid of the closing places. 
[00:58:00]  Don't put me in there.  No.  Don't worry about it.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to...  Get him in there.  Come on, man.  Get him in there.  Get him in there.  Get him in there.  Keep Elmo out.  It's very scary.  That's very believable.  I'm trying to shove Elmo in the microwave.  No, it's okay, Elmo.  We'll just, like, put it in for, like, ten minutes will be fun.  I see Elmo in the microwave, helplessly, us whistling, waiting for the ten minutes. 
[00:58:30]  Showing time going by, right?  That was fun, Elmo, right?  Look, he had fun.  Get him in there.  Now we take Elmo out of the microwave for ten minutes.  Oh, Elmo, wasn't that fun?  There was no fun at all.  You'll be okay.  What is he?  It's a brown towel now.  Oh, he's just burnt up.  Wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Wow, what happened?  You gotta go back a little bit.  No, no.  You haven't missed it.  I missed something.  That's just a towel? 
[00:59:00]  I don't like this part of it.  Why?  That much.  I don't know.  I didn't mind you putting him in the microwave.  I'm okay with that.  I would have liked it better if you had actually had a real Elmo spray painted black or brown  like you got burned.  I could live with that.  Yes, true, true.  But a brown towel, you petting him is lazy.  We only had one.  We only had one, Elmo, though.  Okay.  And we had to do other things with him.  Okay.  Because we had a big finish in mind, and maybe you should go in a time machine and help  us out with the bit.  Yeah, because it's a little too late now.  So far, it's not terrible.  I don't mind you.  You guys were talking, though. 
[00:59:30]  I didn't hear what Ope said when Elmo came out of the microwave.  I didn't either.  You better not ruin my vodka.  Oh, boy.  What was the vodka?  I know.  Brother man, brother man vodka.  I'm still thinking about it.  No.  My first product.  There was no fucking on.  You'll be okay.  You're not going to stun me.  No, you got a tan, brother man.  Jimmy, what?  Oh, my face is ticklish.  Why? 
[01:00:00]  Because you have the giggles?  Well, that's not why at all, actually.  I was just trying to be cool.  We were working at a very young station, so I figured if I had a little lingo to me,  brother man, people would think I'm younger than I was.  You got a tan, brother man.  It kind of rhymes.  It kind of flows off the tongue nicely.  It does rhyme.  Go uptown and say that to people.  Got a tan, brother man.  How about?  It's in the face.  You guys are going to be surprised when I sell a shitload of those T-shirts. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  You got a tan, brother man.  I would wear that on television if you sell that shirt.  You got a tan, brother man.  You don't have no idea.  I would wear that daily.  It's all about the font.  If I could come up with a good font, I think that shirt would do well.  Yes, invisible ink.  Right.  All right, we're done.  That's good.  Let's watch it.  I have to see where it goes now.  You pull the brown towel out.  Right.  All right, Elmo.  It's time for a new game.  This one's really easy.  We're going to play Drive-By Elmo.  Oh, that sounds like fun. 
[01:01:00]  What's that?  All you have to do is sit right over here and wave to all your friends that drive by, okay?  What are you wearing on your head?  See if I can just wave.  Pause.  I can't see the hats.  Well, we're playing a character now.  Oh.  What character?  We're like gangbangers.  Oh, that's who you are?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's how gangbangers dressed back then.  Okay.  Don't you hear the song?  Yeah.  The song brings it all together.  Gangs is paradise.  Duh.  I thought you were doing a Michelle Pfeiffer movie. 
[01:01:30]  What was that movie she did?  Yeah.  Oh, they...  She played the teacher.  This was the theme song.  She walked her through the...  Walking through the...  Where her accent was in and out the whole film.  Yeah.  Thanks.  This is painful.  Gangsters tuck their t-shirts into their jeans?  I don't think so.  Into their mom jeans?  Yeah.  Anyone else know something?  Mom jeans.  Think the jeans are?  So far, though, this is disappointing.  It's not as horrendous as I've hoped.  There's only one so far fairly awful moment.  Which was what?  Brother Man?  Yeah.  Can they keep coming out of the thing? 
[01:02:00]  You pet a brown towel?  There's probably a lot more doucheness.  Well, now they're playing gangsters.  We should have added eyes to the towel.  In hindsight.  Yeah.  We probably should have figured out some kind of eyes on the towel.  Now they're playing gangsters paradise with their shirts tucked into their jeans.  Yeah, I would say that's not consistent.  We didn't have a wardrobe budget.  No.  Just untuck your shirt.  No.  It was all about the tuck back there.  You don't like a tucked in shirt?  The tuck made you look cool.  It did?  Yep.  I knew it had to be something.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  All you have to do is sit right over here and wave to all your friends that drive by,  okay?  Sit right there and just wave?  That's all it is.  That's all it is?  Come on down here.  Oh, I see their ventanas.  I can do this.  You just sit there, Elmo.  I did a pretty good Elmo impression.  There you go.  I like the impression.  Oh, this is going to be fun.  Oh, here comes some of my friends.  Hi, Marie.  Hi, Gordon.  Hello.  Oh, look at my school bus.  Hello.  Oh, who's this coming?  Hi. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, oh, go, go.  Oh, oh.  Good special effects, though.  Oh, God.  Oh, 5-0.  1-8-7 on Sesame Street.  Someone bust a cap in Elmo's ass.  Oh, that egg.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You know, that was the drive-by.  You sit him on the steps, and then there's two guys that drive by,  suspiciously, that look like you guys.  And it's, uh, is that your old car? 
[01:03:30]  Nah, I forgot whose car was that.  I think it was Ian's.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's just some old shitty car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Ant's driving like he's way down Furry.  Oh, yeah.  It was fucking...  Yeah.  It was believable, right?  It is actually fairly believable.  Yeah.  Although Anthony's too swarthy.  Yeah.  Can we go back?  I want to see him again.  No one's all right.  I want to see him again.  You don't have to go back.  I want to see what the guys look like in their gang outfit.  Oh, here comes some of my friends.  Hi, Marie. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Hi, Gordon.  Hello.  We heard this part.  Oh, look at my school bus.  Okay.  Hello.  Oh, who's this coming?  Pause.  Yeah, Opie's in the back seat.  Anthony's driving.  S.A.  And Opie has the gun in the back.  They're each wearing red and blue.  I wish you had shot this in L.A.  So you both would have fucking...  It's out on you.  Right.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  Hi.  We added the gunshots later.  Oh, they're not...  Pretty impressive, right? 
[01:04:30]  A little post.  I like the way you're moving your arms out to show that the gun is shaking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  One eight seven on Sesame Street.  Where did we get a gun?  Someone got the cap in Elmo's ass.  I don't know.  I didn't have any guns.  Oh, that hurt.  Oh.  In Massachusetts.  Now, Elmo, wasn't that drive-by fun?  No, that hurt, Elmo.  Well, we got one more game to play with you this afternoon.  No more games.  No more games.  No.  It's a ride.  It's a ride.  Everything will be okay.  It'll be okay.  It's just like Disneyland, Elmo.  No, Elmo left in here.  Yeah.  Okay, a ride is fun. 
[01:05:00]  A ride will be fun.  All right, follow Anthony.  Okay, come on.  I hope he's mugging for the camera.  I don't know why he did that.  Well, I did that because, let me take you inside the bit a little bit.  We were able to convince Elmo that he's going to go on a fun ride, so I was very happy  that we were able to convince him.  I had to break down the fourth wall and show the people, oh my God, he's buying this. 
[01:05:30]  So you were kind of like secretly winking at the audience?  Right.  But that wasn't necessarily a wink.  Yeah, this was before real TV shows broke down the fourth wall.  Right.  We were the first.  Cutting edge.  We understood breaking down the fourth wall from people.  I don't like that face.  You're saying he was liking some of the subtlety that a wink has?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  All right.  I just, you know, you've got to be bigger than life when you're on TV.  No, on camera.  In theater, you do.  But on camera, you're kind of like, the camera catches everything. 
[01:06:00]  So you could have just winked or just put a small thumbs up would have sufficed.  Can I see this again?  Are you sure?  That would have showed the excitement?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We could have just smiled at the camera as you walked by.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, come on.  What about the thumbs up?  And then a little hop.  And then the hop skip into a circle around.  Right.  Well, I had to now, like, walk away from the camera.  Good thing Elmo didn't see you.  To set up the next scene.  What's hanging out of your pocket?  What the hell's going on there? 
[01:06:30]  I think I used to fucking put hats in my back pocket or something.  I don't know.  What is that?  I don't know.  It looks like a dish towel.  And then you smile.  Like, you turn around, but you kind of smile and hop wrong.  Like, here we go.  Tightly to catch it.  Here we go.  Satin jacket.  Here's the big finish of the Elmo bit.  Let her rip.  Here you go, Elmo.  Bye, bye-bye.  It's not a piece of wood.  People waving goodbye.  And see, it's a wood chipper.  What's that?  There's Elmo. 
[01:07:00]  And his head.  Poor Elmo.  See?  He got, and we, and then we, and then, let's see, because, do we see, I want to see at  the end, uh, the, uh, the faces at the end that you guys, I didn't see the face like  you guys are like celebrating the victory.  They're laughing.  It's very fun.  Yeah.  Did you catch that sand?  They're celebrating the victory?  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Like, they were, like, laughing, like, ah, God.  Holy shit.  Can you believe we convinced that puppet to go into the...  Well, Elmo came apart.  See, it's just pretty much his, you know, upper body is left.  Right.  His waist and his legs are gone.  It's a wood chipper.  Yeah, the wood chipper really pulled him apart.  Pulled him apart.  Pulled him apart.  Let me see that again.  And then, look, we're laughing hysterically.  I know.  Can you believe what happened?  Just celebrating the madness of the bit. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Insanity.  I can't believe we pulled this off.  Utter insanity.  Yeah.  Right?  Now, at the time, the Elmo doll was the number one.  Well, we had to do something.  So, to run it through a wood chipper, people were like, oh, my God.  Oh, I forgot about that part.  That wasn't a tickle me Elmo, though.  It just didn't matter.  No, that Elmo, I remember, it was hard to even get one for the bit.  Oh, that's right.  That's why we did that, because then people were mad, like, you know how hard these are  to get it?  Oh, you ran it through a chipper. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, I forgot about that angle.  That helps it a little bit.  I'll be a squatting and pointing, like, really, like, oh, my God.  And Anthony is kind of looking down into his arm, the way Sergeant Barnes laughed when  O'Neil made the Jewish crack.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He's pointing at the puppet, like, look at that dumb puppet.  Yeah.  Destroyed.  Let's see.  I didn't see your face again.  Oh, we saw it already.  I didn't see your faces.  I like the celebratory mugging. 
[01:09:00]  Elmo's on the ground.  And then me.  That was not fun at all.  That was not fun at all.  I don't know why.  Like, there's a celebration, but then there's the moment where, Ope, you look away, and then  you look back, like, ah!  Jerry loves these.  More than I love anything.  I know.  Did you pump it up a little bit?  Yeah, but I was doing a whole bunch of things, and then assuming that the editor would maybe  help us out a little bit in post. 
[01:09:30]  I'm sure he did.  The problem was worse.  Yeah, that was.  I was just giving a few different reactions.  I didn't think he would use all of them.  That's not the worst thing I've seen.  It's, you know, there's a couple of terrible moments.  I remember at the time, Bruce Mittman, our GM, loved this fucking particular bit.  Oh, he loved that one.  We'd always refer to it.  Yep.  Until our last day at AF, he always went back to this thing.  You're a genius.  Well, what are you going to do?  It's too bad no one has a comment on the phone, so well. 
[01:10:00]  No one does?  Nope.  Nope.  Cool.  Do you like this better or worse than sneaking into the boss's office to get the tickets?  Oof.  That was worse.  That might be the worst one.  Yeah, by anyone ever.  This is not great, but there's a couple of, there's funny stuff in it.  I got a new one I'll post tonight.  I think I'm going to post one a day for a little while.  Yeah.  And then I got another one that's brutal.  What's that one?  This isn't as bad.  What's the brutal one?  Uh, it's how to pick up girls at a beach. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Starring Opie and Anthony.  Nice.  Oh, cool.  Oh.  We'll let you know.  One a day.  Is it a little uncomfortable?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you sure there's enough interest to post?  Not one person on the phone wants to talk about this?  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe the phone's a buster.  Oh, I guess there might be one.  Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hi.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Chris.  Hi.  I'm just trying to listen to this show. 
[01:11:00]  My radio crapped out.  You can put me back on hold if I'm interrupting.  But it says you're...  All right.  See?  No one wants to say anything.  Yeah.  He was the only guy on the phone?  Well, I mean, you know, I don't like people staying the obvious.  Come up with something that's not as obvious.  Go ahead, sir, in Georgia.  Hey, Opie.  Nice Dorothy Hamill haircut. 
[01:11:30]  Dorothy Hamill.  Wow.  I think Dorothy Hamill had a shorter do.  A little more of a bob.  I thought you were going to go with the Prince Valiant.  That's the...  Prince Valiant.  That's the one.  No, beautiful man.  I laughed my ass off last night.  Good job.  I don't think he was laughing with us, though.  No, I don't think he was either.  Let me say hi to Doug and Hoboken.  Doug.  I can't believe you two guys have fuck you money.  Well, you know. 
[01:12:00]  You live and learn.  That was...  The next time you do something, you get a little better.  You're looking at it from where we are now.  Right.  See, back then, we were just, you know, starting the whole rise of the empire there.  So, you know, that's where you start.  Yeah.  In that clip, you're looking at two guys that absolutely had no money.  Oh, man.  And had all the confidence in the world that they were going to do it.  Oh, yeah.  That's what's pretty amazing to watch in these old clips.  Yeah.  We had no doubt we were going to be something. 
[01:12:30]  We had not one second of hesitation to do any of that stuff.  Right.  We didn't sit there and talk to the camera guy or the other guy, Ian, or something, and  go, I don't know.  Nah, I don't want to do that.  It was, yep, let's do it.  Yeah, we're just doing it.  Here we go.  We're just kind of having fun.  Making comedy.  Not trying to, like, defend the actual material, but I know.  I know where I was at in my head back then.  Oh, yeah.  We were having a good time and had a lot of confidence for whatever reason. 
[01:13:00]  Well, mine came out of a bottle.  That's why.  Let me say hi to John, Staten Island.  John.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony.  Yo.  You have the same hair consistency as Frankie Carbone in good color.  Yeah, that, uh, I had that fro thing cooking.  I don't know.  That's the Italian gene.  Everyone has an uncle like that.  The ponytail.  Oh, boy.  I don't, yeah.  I don't know why we do this to ourselves. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know either.  Other people would just bury this shit.  Yeah.  Uh, make-believe it never happened.  I love you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Adam in Massachusetts.  Adam.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Jimmy, love you, man.  Love it when you come to Boston.  Thank you, buddy.  Oh.  Um, I don't know if you guys remember a little thing called Testicle Tuesday back in the day.  I sure do.  What?  That bit, I, uh, I stand by still.  Every Tuesday, remember, we had people coming in to do other shit with their testicles.  The big one was, uh, the penis weightlifting. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, okay.  We did penis weightlifting before anyone else.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's true there.  I think we even-  I remember that.  I think we even did penis weightlifting when we came to New York at NAW, where we had one  guy that was completely out of control with how much weight he lifted with his penis.  Ah, that's right.  Remember?  Yeah.  And then we'd invite-  And we'd invite all the women in so it wouldn't be considered gay?  Yeah, so it wasn't as gay.  But you can't even do that now.  Imagine inviting, like, members of the off-air staff, hey, come on in, watch a guy tie something 
[01:14:30]  to his dick.  Yeah, this is how different it's become.  Back then, if we did a bit with the guy's genitals, we had a few.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  We would have someone walk around and just ask office people and sales ladies and whatnot,  hey, you want to come in and see some dick and balls?  If you did that now, you wouldn't even have a meeting.  They would just fire you on the spot.  So fired.  Yeah, but that was even cool.  You guys, technical Tuesday was you filled in a water mattress with, see how much you 
[01:15:00]  can fill it with water, and then popped it.  That was the whole thing.  I got to find, if anyone has a really good clip of that, good quality video clip of the,  it was a water bed.  A water bed in Plainville, Massachusetts, in somebody's yard.  Was that for Real Rock TV?  I think it was.  Yeah, it was terrible.  And then it wouldn't pop, and then somebody had to jump on it with a knife, and it still  wouldn't pop, and everybody was like, what? 
[01:15:30]  But then it turned into this huge, ridiculous, like, two-second wave.  Yeah, it finally opened up.  I would love to see that clip.  I haven't seen that one in years.  If someone has it, please send it along.  That sticks in my mind.  That was like, who knows, like fucking 15, 20 years?  Who knows how long ago?  Yeah, about 16, maybe.  We've been out of Boston 16 years already.  That's unbelievable to me.  Yeah, you guys were the shit in Boston, man, so.  Well, for the time, I mean, things certainly have changed with phones and everything else, 
[01:16:00]  but I don't know.  I thought we did all right.  Hi, boys.  Watch out.  I have pride in our AF work for the most part, especially like the last year, year and a half.  Yeah, it was all fucking, you know.  We were definitely firing on all cylinders.  Getting the fucking, getting the pieces of the puzzle together.  Right.  Some pieces, you know, should have been thrown out, I guess.  But it all came together nicely.  Well, I got another clip I'll upload when I get home.  Oh, good.  I can't wait to see it.  I love them.  Love them. 
[01:16:30]  And then I got to edit the beach clip together.  Edit it.  Just put it up as it is.  You don't need it.  No editing needed.  No, what it was, we were doing cut-ins for the show, so we did this whole thing that  went through the whole show from a beach.  So I have to edit it all together just to make it make sense.  Is it really good?  It's us trying to, showing the rest of the guys out there how to pick up chicks.  Oh, boy.  At a beach.  Oh, boy.  You got a tan, brother, man.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, you're going to be surprised when those t-shirts hit the market.  I'm going to sell tens of shirts.  Yikes.  All right, we should take a break, huh?  All righty.  I think they found a large debris field.  Is this the latest?  Oh.  Did this just happen, or is this?  Because when they say breaking news on TV now, I don't know.  That could be something they said 12 hours ago, but they still call it breaking news.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Large potential debris field spotted.  If I see that left turn, I know they have nothing. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  So where is the large debris field?  Same spot they were kind of in.  It's in Ohio.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Which makes it weird.  Yeah.  They waited too long, man.  I'm not into this story anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just like boring now.  Yeah.  The arc of the story.  Yeah.  They just, they dragged it on too long.  Too long.  Too long.  If they, you know, found this last week, I'd still be in.  Should have shortened it up.  I'm more about the mudslide now.  Yeah.  The mudslide is a very interesting story. 
[01:18:00]  And did you see that fire in Houston?  What was that?  One of our listeners filmed a guy getting rescued from that fire in Houston.  Yeah.  It's out there somewhere.  If that guy's listening right now, tweet it.  I'll retweet you.  But, yeah, with the, you know, they're trying to rescue him, and he's on the top floor outside,  and the fire is raging.  Have you seen this?  Let's see.  OMG.  OMG.  OMG.  Wow, that thing is spreading so fucking fast. 
[01:18:30]  That is like.  Oh, Jesus.  They're going to bring the ladder truck over.  Look, the construction worker's stuck, and then look, the fire pops up right behind the  windows.  It's kind of looking like, uh.  And he's like, fuck, I'm in trouble.  Not now.  And he doesn't think that he has enough time to wait for the ladder.  Yeah.  What floor is he on?  He's on the top.  It looks like it's maybe six stories, five, six stories, probably.  That is a fucking fire, man.  Look at, it is raging.  Wow.  The whole top floor is just about gone.  This guy is on the freaking ledge.  He's on the ledge.  It's a new construction, I guess. 
[01:19:00]  Do they see him?  Wow.  Oh, they see him.  All right, you dumb.  Oh, it's starting to come out the door.  Oh, my Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's a terrible fire.  We'll put this video on our Facebook page, by the way.  Holy shit.  He's just squatting on the outside ledge, and fire is really all over.  And he's cool right now.  Like, all right, they're going to get to me.  But look how fast the fire is spreading.  He should hang off and try to get to that bottom ledge.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He's probably feeling the heat.  Yeah, now he's like, fuck, I've got to get off this level.  So he's got to fall in such a way where he doesn't fall all the way to the ground. 
[01:19:30]  Good move.  So he hangs and falls down to the next.  It's like a video game.  Fire is a motivator.  Right.  It really is.  But the second floor doesn't really have any flames yet.  So now he's in a much better spot.  Dude, that was a great movie just made.  But you have to swing a little bit or you're going to miss that ledge, right?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And now here comes the ladder.  Damn.  Just in time.  Good move, though, by the guy, right?  Hell of a move.  That fire spread fast.  How fucking slow is that ladder? 
[01:20:00]  Move it.  Fires are a motherfucker, huh?  Oh, my God.  The firefighters screaming at the truck.  Yeah.  It's like they're trying to get the fucking thing to the plane, the jetway.  Yeah.  Same idiot driving it.  This guy's like, hey, I really like to get on this.  And then he gets on the ladder.  Thank you, God.  There you go.  Nice.  There you go.  He's saved.  Wow.  That's the guy who took a little initiative.  It's one, two, three.  It looks like the jump made the jump.  Four, maybe five stories.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  There's more.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  I didn't see this part. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  The roof just collapsed.  The whole side.  Yeah.  Yep.  The entire top.  The front-facing side just all fell toward the ladder.  And I'm sure that other piece is about to fall.  Why, it is fucking burning.  If you want to watch along, it's on ONA Show on Twitter.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, half the building, half the top roof is still standing.  The half he was on, that's probably going to fall soon, too.  What an idiot.  I saw him get on the ladder.  I'm like, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I missed the big grand finish where the whole top floor falls forward. 
[01:21:00]  That happened to me once.  Or the wall.  Did it?  Chip?  Yeah, it got out of there.  I bet it didn't.  No, it did not.  Guy who hijacks the story for no reason.  It has nothing to add.  It has nothing.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Mm-hmm.  That guy knew he had to make that swing.  Right.  You wouldn't normally do that, but I guess when there's a raging fire.  Oh, yeah.  Man, that really makes you do stuff that you normally would probably rethink.  Sure. 
[01:21:30]  That's a big video today.  Go check it out.  ONA Show on Twitter.  Follow us, all right?  Mm-hmm.  We tweet all the links to the videos we watch.  Sure we do.  Yeah.  Which we like to do on a regular basis, and you would think the company at this point would  go, oh, wow, I think they're really into this video thing.  Maybe we should try to figure something out.  I hate it.  But no.  We can't stand video.  More Opie and Anthony in a minute. 
[01:22:00]  Happy birthday, Steven Tyler.  Uh-oh.  66.  Wow.  66 for Steven Tyler.  Wow.  Damn.  And, uh, Leonard Nimoy. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, boy.  83.  83.  Wow.  I think he's got the oxygen now in the wheelchair.  I saw a picture of him leaving an airport.  What the fuck was that?  There's somebody's apparatus for penis weightlifting on the screen.  Oh.  I think E-Rock just, uh, tweeted the pictures from our penis weightlifting thing.  Thank goodness.  We did it at N.E.W.  Whoops.  Yeah.  Is it on the, uh, the show Twitter? 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Oh, and a show.  If you go there, E-Rock just, uh, tweeted a link to the penis weightlifting pictures.  The madhouse.  I don't remember any of these people.  No, no.  No clue.  Jimmy goes, who's that girl?  And me and Anthony are like, I don't know, just a girl that came by that day.  No idea.  There were always people just waiting to come up and hang out on the show.  Open door policy.  It's crazy.  Everything has to be controlled.  Everything has to be controlled.  Look out. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, God.  If someone comes in there, it could be a lawsuit.  Great.  Yeah.  Great news, guys.  You could use the fishbowl here.  Oh, cool.  So we could just, what, have people come up?  Well, we want them to email like a week, two weeks in advance.  And we only want, like, maybe 20 people in there.  And they're going to have to go through all sorts of security checks.  Good way to get that spontaneity.  Right.  We just, whenever people call them, hey, I'm on the side. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, come on.  Come on up.  What the hell?  We got enough beer for everybody.  That's how Big A got discovered.  You heard him on the phone.  You're like, who is that guy?  Go back to him.  I'll never meet him.  We were just interviewing people.  I'm like, what is that guy all about?  Come up here now.  And we tiptoes around my parties and snapping pictures.  Right.  Is he still doing that?  No, he's so paranoid now.  Oh, really?  Can I take a picture?  You mind if I post it?  Big A's funny, man.  He's all nervous about everything.  I was talking to him at the Voss and Bonnie podcast thing. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  He's fucking funny, man.  He's a good guy.  Takes his shots.  I love him.  Yeah.  He was beating up on somebody, but in a funny way.  He was funny, man.  No, he's always a good guy.  Always very cordial over the house and everything.  No?  No.  I don't like him at all.  I would like to try to figure out how we could get more people up here to do shit.  I know.  That would be great.  We gave up on that with the...  Couch of zilches.  The old regime.  Yes, remember?  The couch of zilches.  We wanted the couch of zilches. 
[01:25:00]  Zilches.  Couch of zilches.  Oh, boy.  We're just not nice.  We only did that once.  Yeah.  It worked, though.  It was fun, yeah.  I know.  In other music news.  Music news.  Jimmy's boys there are on the cover of Rolling Stone finally.  Finally for the first time.  And I kind of love the way Paul Stanley is just so annoyed by all of it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's just shitting on the Hall of Fame.  He's doing...  They're going in.  It's a smart money thing to do.  But he's not... 
[01:25:30]  He's really irritated by the...  Well, it should have happened many years ago.  Many years ago.  Is there a picture online?  It's actually a great cover.  Did they get everyone together?  No.  It's an old picture from the 70s.  Oh.  Wait.  Why wouldn't...  They just took an old picture and, uh...  Yeah.  They should get...  Ah.  All right.  Oh, my.  I love those days.  Yeah, that's an old picture, all right.  That's fucking...  Yeah, it's probably...  That's in their prime, right?  74, yeah.  How are you doing, people?  Ace.  Ace's hands.  Huh?  Yeah, Ace looks really high. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, he looks...  Oh, sure.  He's all fucked up.  How...  How high do you have to be where it's obvious through makeup?  Yeah.  And a still picture.  Right.  But you could see it in his eyes.  Like, hey, man.  I know you're gonna be done Rolling Stone.  Those guys took the best group shots of any band ever.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they weren't afraid to...  Yeah, they just knew how to take a group shot.  What's the article about them?  Just that they're...  Oh, 40 years.  40 years of feuds and fury.  Oh, boy. 
[01:26:30]  It's forever exclamation point.  It's actually a great fucking cover.  But...  They interviewed all of them.  Oh, they did?  Yes.  Oh.  There's an article that I highlighted for you.  I see.  It's all new stuff.  Would you like that framed, all signed by each one of them?  Yeah, I have a cool thing signed by each one of them.  I have a cream magazine.  Oh, yeah.  There was a centerfold you opened up.  And it's one of my favorite kiss photo shoots ever.  It's them.  Like, it's in this fake snow.  But when I was a kid, I loved it so much. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  In fake snow.  Can you find that?  Kiss in fake...  Why are they doing that?  I don't know.  But it was the 70s, man.  It was great.  It was groovy.  And I had them all sign it.  And I want to frame it.  I love it.  You were one year off on the picture.  Not that it matters.  Is it 74 or 75?  75.  Oh, okay.  No, you were right there.  You were right there, man, with the...  Damn.  Yeah.  See if you can do the image search.  Man, we should have fun memories.  I keep thinking about Ace and Peter, Simmons admits, in this article, Jimmy. 
[01:27:30]  Okay.  What are they doing now?  Where are they?  It's got to be close to the end.  How do you make any money?  How do you pay your bills?  Wow.  Well, even Stanley and Simmons have had their differences.  We've always seen each other as brothers, says Stanley.  What we seem to be at odds at is how you treat your brother.  Gene's priority, by far, has always been...  Moolah.  Marketing?  Marketing?  Any other guesses?  Bitches.  No, it's the same money.  You should get this one. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, chicks.  I can't believe Paul Stanley's saying this.  Chicks?  What we seem to be at odds with is how to treat your brother.  Gene's priority, by far, has always been...  Chicks.  Any more guesses?  Gene.  You read the fucking article.  No, I've been looking at stupid Kiss and the snow photos because I'm not finding the right one.  Yeah.  No, you're not.  Look at how much fun they're having.  Hi, guys.  Boy.  Look at us.  That looks good.  That's not the one, though, but that's the same photo shoot, I think.  Yeah.  Wow.  Don't you like that?  No. 
[01:28:30]  But Paul Stanley's saying Gene's always been about himself.  About Gene.  Something we might have brought up a few times on this show.  Yeah.  And he's not one to let anyone else's feelings or contributions get in the way.  Wow.  An asshole.  That's a pretty good shot from Paul Stanley.  Just an asshole.  Look at my Paul Stanley book.  He's got a new book coming out.  Oh, yeah?  And I'm dying to get it because I want to interview him for my Boneyard show, and I'm not getting the book.  Rent, boys?  No, it's not the book.  Oh.  They explain why they're not playing.  Okay.  You want to know?  Yeah, I'd love to. 
[01:29:00]  Stanley and Simmons offered to allow the former members, we're talking about Peter and Ace,  obviously, to jam with Kiss's current lineup, featuring guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer  Eric Singer.  But Ace and Peter found that proposition deeply insulting.  It is.  I won't be disrespected, Peter Chris says.  How could you put me in the Hall of Fame and then tell me to go sit over there in the corner  while another guy puts on my makeup and plays?  That's an injustice to the fans, too.  Why the fuck would Gene and Paul, and you know it's Gene, why wouldn't they just tell 
[01:29:30]  the other guys, look, Hall of Fame, this is because of the shit that we all did.  Right.  Let's play.  The original lineup put them on the map.  Oh, that's fucking...  It's Paul, too, though.  It's not just Gene.  But you know what?  They were able to sustain for many years after the original lineup, but still, you've got  to go out there as the originals and play a few songs, and then maybe you bring the other  guys out and fool around a little bit.  I think it's also because they just announced a big tour with Def Leppard, and Kiss is doing  Fallon, I think, like the week after, and I think they want to put not too much focus 
[01:30:00]  on the old, and this is, I'm guessing, the old band, because they're on tour with the  new band.  Oh, Gene.  How do you like this guy still, Jimmy?  I love him.  I know.  I know you do.  Why do you still like this guy?  I don't know.  Gene Simmons counters.  Don't you think that's a good point by Peter Crissone?  Of course.  Okay.  It's a stellar point.  I think it's a very good point.  Yes.  And I don't think there's any...  I mean, this is a little venom, but I think they're making a good point. 
[01:30:30]  I'll say it again.  Yeah.  Simmons counters that Freely and Chris no longer deserve to wear the paint.  Ugh.  Why?  Why?  They all made their bones in that makeup.  Why?  You ready to hear this?  Yeah.  The makeup is earned.  He is such a douchebag.  He's an asshole.  I don't like that phrasing.  He's just a douchebag.  He's a fucking asshole.  The makeup is earned, he adds.  Just being there at the beginning is not enough. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And if you blow it for yourself, it's your fault.  You can't blame your band members.  Oh, look what happened to me.  Oh, poor me.  Look at my little violin.  I have no sympathy.  That's all Gene Simmons.  Yeah.  It's...  You know, look, I understand...  Bands have problems.  How many records did Beth sell?  Oh, that's right.  A lot.  I mean, it was Beck, and it wouldn't have sold very many.  Oh, sure.  I was the one who told him to change it to Beth.  I told him to change it to Beth. 
[01:31:30]  Did you really?  Beth was the...  That was the name that we needed in order to sell it.  Never would have sold without the name Beth, and that was me.  Shut the fuck up.  Can't stand his pontificating.  You know, in defense of Gene, I will say this.  I think it's loud and clear that you love kids.  No, no, no.  And that this is coming from me and Ann.  But I understand...  Two out of the three.  I understand why Ace and Peter are fucking furious and disgusted. 
[01:32:00]  But in a way, it's always easier to look at the outed guys or the ousted guys and go like,  Hey, man, fuck the original...  But then you look at Gene and Paul.  It's like, okay, Ace and Peter were gone by 80, say.  That's 30-something years ago.  And with...  Imagine if on this radio show, people kept looking at people that were here.  Like, when people go, those were the good days.  You're like, okay, they were good days.  But we've done a lot more since then.  Right.  Don't look at the radio show back in those days as the only legitimate part of the radio show.  But they are going into the Hall of Fame based on what they did in those early days. 
[01:32:30]  But they've said so many things.  And they had way more hits with the original lineup than afterward.  Right?  Yeah, that's the best lineup.  But again, picture saying, okay, you guys got to do a live broadcast, but you got to bring back all the guys from this year and make...  And I mean, we've teased him, but like, fuck Sam and E-Rock, get them out of here and bring these guys in.  You'd be like, yeah, but we don't have the chemistry with them anymore.  Too many shitty things have happened and been said.  But that would be the behind-the-scenes people. 
[01:33:00]  The nucleus of the show is us three.  No, but I mean, there was guys that came on the...  It would be more like if you moved on and then there was Bad Blood and then we were doing some big thing.  We said, no, we just can't have Jimmy.  Right, right, right.  I can't imagine doing that.  Yeah.  It's more of that, I think.  Yeah.  Sam gets a lot of mic time, but I mean, this has been the nucleus for a long fucking time.  And we've had guys that have done the show semi-regular that were amazing for us, absolutely.  And we don't get along with some of those people, unfortunately.  The original Ronald McDonald has not earned the makeup anymore. 
[01:33:30]  He doesn't earn the makeup.  Ronald McDonald, the original Bulls of the Clown.  Right, but that would be like us going into the, I don't know, Radio Hall of Fame,  but either me or Ann moved on a while ago, or you, and us three don't get back together for something like that?  That's crazy.  Yeah, and it's like for the Opie and Anthony show, but Opie shows up with somebody that he's doing radio with now  and demands that him and that guy get to do that.  I don't see anything.  No, but we've never had that kind of a falling out or said that kind of stuff about each other publicly. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, we've had falling outs.  Oh, no, don't get me wrong.  No, but I'm saying it would be like if they said, okay, Jim, you sit out, Sam sit out.  Maybe they sit all the sit out, and you guys talk to just, say, Mark and a few of the guys from, say, 2000 or 99,  and that's who we're inducting.  You might go, yeah, but that's weird now because it's been so long and the show has done so much.  It might just feel like why are you, I don't know.  I can understand their point, too, and it's not the popular point to understand, 
[01:34:30]  but I do see where they're coming from.  Hey, look, if they could have allowed the band to die in 1980, the band would have been dead.  It's like people kill Ozzy for what's happening in Sabbath.  Hey, Ozzy was fired from Sabbath, so whatever he wants when he comes back, it's kind of fair game.  They fired him.  But you're talking about the main players and the nucleus of a band.  Yeah.  I think it's a little different.  You always have side people coming and going on a radio show that do amazing stuff.  I'm not downplaying anything that anyone has done for us.  Thank you.  I give you a big thank you. 
[01:35:00]  Continue to hate.  I don't give a fuck.  Thank you for what you have done for our show.  Continuous success.  But, I mean, you know, it's the nucleus we're talking about here with Kiss.  Yeah.  I think it's just too much bad.  Because even with the Kiss original lineup, didn't they have side players coming in here  and there to go on tour with?  Well, when they were touring, it was just them.  An extra drummer?  Never.  They never added any extra people?  No, but I think also Ace raised a point, too.  And, again, I love Ace and Peter.  So, I'm very hurt that they're not.  Ace raises a pint. 
[01:35:30]  What's that?  Ace raises a pint.  And I'll tell you, we're lucky enough to know these guys pretty good.  We've talked to all of them over the years numerous times.  And, for me, Peter, Chris, and Ace Frehley were way cooler than Gene and Paul.  And Paul wasn't even that bad, to be honest with you.  That's true.  But I think, yeah, I think Peter and Ace are just way more down-earth and just extremely cool guys.  I want to know, Ace said, every time there's a reunion, what happens is the four of us get together 
[01:36:00]  and then the fans don't want to see, you know, Eric and Tommy.  They want to see Ace, Gene, Peter, and Paul.  So, what happens is, and Ace said it, they don't want to open that can of worms.  It's like, that is the way, when you see the four of them up there together, all you want to see is them playing.  Right.  And they sold, Ace and Peter, in fairness, did sell their rights or at least their makeup things back to Kit.  Right.  They didn't have to do that.  They could have said no, but they did it.  I'm not just throwing away the current members.  Yeah.  But, when you think Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they try to get the original guys. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  They start with that.  They've done this in the past.  They start with those guys and then they maybe add other people that were involved with the band.  I think it's just crazy to me to have Kiss go in and Ace and Peter are not playing with them.  That's ridiculous.  I honestly would prefer to see the new guys in newer makeup.  Like, I would be much happier with Kiss if, like, Tommy and Eric were in different makeup.  I would still think they're a valid band and valid contributors because they're doing new music.  I don't need to see Peter and Ace's makeup. 
[01:37:00]  I don't need the old look.  Like, I'd be okay with Gene and Paul looking like they look and two guys looking like their own original characters in the band.  I'd be fine with that.  What would they do?  But, you know, they'd find something.  And it could be close to that theme, but I think that would make these guys stand out more as original musicians, too, the newer guys.  Freely adds here, Freely suggests another reason for the current members' reluctance.  The reason they don't want to perform with me and Peter is because the last time they did, they had to do a reunion tour.  We play three songs, the fans go crazy. 
[01:37:30]  So the fans would go nuts if they saw the original lineup playing.  And then that would mean, oh, man, there's money in a reunion.  And then they have to pay these guys more than probably they would pay the other guys.  Well, they've got a Def Leppard tour coming up.  They have to do it anyway.  They don't want to open up a can of worms.  Freely, meanwhile, says he licensed rather than sold the rights to his Spaceman makeup to the band  and suggests that he's due to get the rights back sometime soon.  Also in the story, Simmons says his touring days are almost done.  I wish I could do him. 
[01:38:00]  I'm 64 now, he says.  Three more tours.  Two, if I have a life change of some kind.  He'll continue doing this.  Of course, he loves the money.  He does.  Money, money, money.  Money.  He loves cash, that guy.  Yeah.  But Jimmy sees it differently.  No, but I see it both ways.  I do see Ace and Peter.  I mean, I'm not saying that I don't love those guys in the band.  I want the original lineup.  That's the band I like.  Right.  But it's always tempting to look at the guys who are out of the band and kind of, because 
[01:38:30]  the guys that are in the band are more the corporate guys now at this point.  Well, fuck them.  Right.  But it's like in a four-way thing, there were four rock stars and Ace and Peter were kind  of the wild, you know, the partiers of the four.  And what would have happened if that tone had been allowed to dictate the band?  Kiss probably would have died in 1980.  And then the band would have been gone and Gene and Paul would not be doing solo projects,  but we wouldn't be even talking about this.  True that.  I don't know.  I think they did enough before.  Maybe.  The big change to. 
[01:39:00]  Possible.  To allow them to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  But all those years of touring afterwards, there was a lot of music that came out.  What were the big songs that came out after the original lineup?  Heaven's on Fire, Lick It Up was huge.  That was a massive song.  Lick It Up.  Yeah.  What other songs?  Lick It Up.  There were some other ones.  I mean, I can't.  There definitely were.  Yeah.  Let me think.  Let me think.  I'll just look it up.  That was the no makeup days?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I much prefer the makeup, because it also, like, when people with the radio show will 
[01:39:30]  say, well, you know, your show is not, but it's like, yeah, maybe you changed a little  bit, too.  Yeah.  So the show represents something to the way you felt about yourself back then.  And that's how I love it.  I was a kid, and that's what that means to me.  Well, the weird part is we have way more listeners now than we ever had, but our prime  was probably, you know, NAW through the first couple years of XM.  I mean, I love what we're doing now, but this is a drastically different show, unfortunately.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to be doing a completely different show than this, but our hands are fucking 
[01:40:00]  tied, I'm telling you.  Our hands are tied.  At least we've been able to kind of, you know, adjust and reinvent ourselves a little bit,  but the prime was, man, all that beer and shots and girls and nudity, and just every  day we didn't know what the hell we were going to do next.  Now we have to just talk and hopefully be clever, funny, and thought-provoking.  Tears Are Falling was a big one.  Oh, sure.  The Hell's Breaking Loose was a big song.  Yep.  God Gave Rock and Roll to You, which I never loved, but Heaven's on Fire, Lick It Up. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, they had a few big songs.  What was that disco song?  That was, uh, that was I Was Made for Loving You.  That was off Dynasty.  I was made for loving you.  I like that album.  I like that song.  I do, too.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  2000 Man was on that, the Stone song.  Yeah, I liked it.  Yeah.  A little disco-ish.  Disco kiss.  But I still like this.  And Paul Stanley, a fucking phenomenal voice.  Can't say Paul did a great voice.  This is hilarious, though. 
[01:41:00]  It's like, we'll just do a disco tune.  We'll play it in all the discos.  But they pulled it off.  Other bands tried to do this shit, and it didn't work.  Rush with their rap song.  Yeah.  Trying to think of others.  I'm sure there's a lot of other examples.  I want to give it all to you.  I want to give it all to you.  Oh, boy.  Sounds like John Travolta.  Hey.  Darkness.  But he's, but he's, Paul's kind of saying a lot of shit publicly now, which usually was 
[01:41:30]  just Gene doing it.  Yeah, yeah.  But Paul, it's not just Gene.  Paul is a part of his.  It was Peter Criss's book.  That was a doozy.  Oh, that might have been what it was.  That might have been what it was.  Both of them, yeah.  They both had some stories to tell.  Because they were always more diplomatic than Peter and Ace.  Like, when they would trash him, they'd be like, well, they've partied too much.  These guys are getting specific.  Oh, are they?  Well, maybe not a Kiss song, but I think there's another song that Gene and fucking Paul should 
[01:42:00]  take advice from.  That's all I'm saying.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I think they...  Oh, that's born.  Yes, Gene.  Yes, Paul.  I'm crying, pitching a fist.  Oh, yeah.  Gene was pitching a fist.  And his hair.  You didn't think it was...  You didn't think it was kind of cool, though, when Gene and Paul were both in makeup and  they came through.  There's something fucking...  That's cool as fuck.  Very... 
[01:42:30]  Ten feet tall.  ...cool about those guys.  When they're made up and...  I don't care.  If you hate the band, you hate the band.  They're like life-size, bigger-than-life action figures.  They really are.  No, I like their image, but I just don't like Gene when he starts talking.  All that other stuff is cool as shit, of course.  They give good hugs, those guys.  Do they?  Yeah.  Jimmy, yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's a famous hugging thing.  Yeah.  Tony in Cleveland.  Tony.  Hey.  How's it going today, guys?  Hi, Tony.  Hey, all right.  Hey, Jimmy.  I know your argument, but I would have to disagree with it. 
[01:43:00]  Okay.  Because if you look at the fact when Metallica was entered into the Hall of Fame, Jason  Newt that came on stage, played with them, and then they went on tour later, and nobody  cared that it wasn't him on the stage.  Right.  You're right.  But they at least acknowledged him, like, hey, man, you know.  He filled the...  They also acknowledged, you know...  He filled the spot very well.  You're also...  But I know what you mean, but don't forget, the breakup of Jason leaving Metallica had 
[01:43:30]  a different effect, because the main guys there were Lars and James.  I mean, you know, Hammett's a huge part of Metallica, too, but Jason, it was never...  With Kiss, it was different.  There's a representation of the original band.  It's a different feeling from the fans.  It's not the same feeling from the fans.  Jason was just as big to Metallica as Ace was to Kiss.  No, he was not.  I would have to disagree.  He was not.  And we like Newstead a lot.  He's great.  And he definitely filled his role and did very well for... 
[01:44:00]  How many years was he in the band?  I think from 19...  I want to say 90...  No, no, before 90.  I want to say he did at least 10, right?  Yeah.  He did about 10, maybe?  Yeah, I don't know.  He was on there during their biggest years.  Yeah, he was, but I mean, him leaving did not have the same impact as Gene and Peter.  I'm sorry, Ace and Peter being gone from Kiss.  It's just not.  Because Kiss was bigger than life.  It wasn't just, you know, this band that you love.  They were cartoon characters.  They were superheroes. 
[01:44:30]  Right?  Yeah, they were characters, too.  And don't forget, they didn't go on and get a guy who looked like Jason to behave like...  You know, Rob Trujillo is his own guy.  Right.  He's a bad motherfucker, and he fits right in with the band.  He's great.  That's a normal lineup change.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody's begging for a Jason Newstead reunion.  No, and it's not even a knock on Jason.  He's a great player.  No, not at all.  He's awesome.  It's just that's a typical band departure.  It has a lot to do with the makeup.  A lot to do with the makeup.  And how their personas were bigger than life.  Yeah, so I know what you're saying, sir, but I disagree with you that that's the same thing. 
[01:45:00]  Exactly.  This reminds me, like, two years ago with Guns N' Roses.  Right.  Oh, God.  And everybody wanted them to reunite.  And Axl, as much as I wanted to see a Guns N' Roses reunion, put out that statement saying,  you know, we don't owe you your happy ending at our expense.  He's like, people get divorced, time goes on.  Yeah, even they hate each other.  Yeah, they hate each other.  That's not going to happen.  I respect the fact we don't owe you anything.  That's hilarious.  We don't owe you anything.  Yeah.  Hey, man, a bunch of records.  Guns N' Roses are the perfect example. 
[01:45:30]  The guys went out without Axl and gave the new guys a chance to play.  But that was because Axl refused.  I was a huge Guns N' Roses fan still.  When I hear a Guns N' Roses song, I'm all in.  And I was bummed they couldn't get the mean guys together for that.  But Axl was always difficult, obviously.  Of course.  He's a narcissist.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Denver.  Ryan, how's the week?  Nice.  It's fantastic out here.  Tell me more, brother man. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Let's move you to town.  It's crazy out here, man.  Man, it's crazy out here, man.  You got tan, brother man.  I got to say brother man a few times if I'm going to sell those t-shirts.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you got to.  So I wanted to say to Jimmy, the other day we were talking,  or you guys were talking about how much you hated Eric Clapton  for fucking George Harrison's wife.  And I'm just wondering how you can defend Gene  after all these years of fucking his band over.  I mean, it seems almost. 
[01:46:30]  Hold on.  And I get it.  You're a big fan, and I totally get that.  I'll answer your question.  I don't think he's fucking his band over.  How is he fucking Paul Stanley over?  Well, he's not fucking Paul Stanley over.  And I would argue that Peter Criss is a mediocre drummer at best.  But those were the reasons, like, Peter and Ace, as part of the group,  is part of the reason that Kiss is getting inducted into the Hall of Fame.  I totally agree.  And I love those guys.  I love Peter and Ace, dude. 
[01:47:00]  I love them.  Like, I love them as much as Gene and Paul.  And I'm not saying that Gene and Paul are right and fuck Peter and Ace.  I am only saying that it's tempting for the fans.  We always tend to look, because the reunion means much more to us as guys.  Like, as fans, to look at the original lineup means something,  because we're not the actual performer.  But when you're the performer, you look at it differently.  And there was a lot of shit said behind the scenes,  a lot of bad blood between those guys that we didn't see,  a lot of shit that happened that we did not see. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, Gene can be a motherfucker, but I'm sure Ace and Peter had their moments.  They weren't just two guys who showed up,  didn't said nothing wrong, were totally responsible,  and were thrown out because Gene's a terrible Jewish person.  Come on, dude, that's not realistic.  They should write a new song.  Suck it up!  Suck it up!  You know what I mean, dude?  It's tempting to see that like that as a fan,  but that's, I don't think, realistically, business-wise.  But it's just, they're like a Hall of Fame.  It's strange.  Because when you love a band, you know,  name a band, you know the lineup you like from that band mostly. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  And what would win as far as, you know, some kind of, I don't know.  I'm starting to think now, fuck it,  because it's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Why is that so coveted and holy that a band should get together  when they have differences?  Fuck it.  Yeah.  I've just changed my opinion.  There you go.  I started getting caught up in the whole thing like,  oh, it's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Who gives a shit?  I've never even gone there because it's so awful.  And Paul is smashing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on fucking Twitter. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  He's going like, you know, because somebody tweeted something,  and I put, I'm just happy kisses on the cover of Rolling Stone.  And somebody tweeted me but wrote, yeah,  I wish it was just a magazine that knew music.  And Paul wrote, I love this.  Like, he loves smashing them.  He's tired of them.  Have you guys gone to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland?  I did once when I was out there.  I was highly disappointed.  Yeah, me too.  Highly.  Me too.  The building itself is amazing.  It's beautiful.  It's worth, you know, walking through, I guess.  But you start realizing that it's just, you know, just crap that was laying around in attics. 
[01:49:00]  Garbage.  It doesn't mean much for the fans.  Like, Jimi Hendrix wore this hat once back in when he was at a picnic or whatever the fuck.  What, you're supposed to snap pictures of it?  Yeah.  Show people.  They have some stuff that's kind of cool, but, man, I was very disappointed.  Yeah.  I mean, they do a good job trying to present everything they did get from the families and stuff, but.  Did you see Jim Morrison's Cub Scout uniform?  Is that one of the things?  Yes.  Yeah, I saw it.  I forgot.  Are you kidding?  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, yeah, I do remember that now that you said that.  That's kind of cool, actually.  Like, I wouldn't mind seeing some weird stuff like that.  I guess.  I think you want to see this.  I don't know all this stuff.  I remember going there when I was younger.  My mom saying, see, Jim Morrison was a Cub Scout, too.  Oh, God.  Good.  Unfortunately, you didn't end die at the same age he did.  27.  Jeez.  I couldn't think of anything.  I know.  No, you just went for the brutality of that for brutality.  I'm happy you're alive, Sam.  Thank you, Jim.  I want to ask Jimmy if deep down it's, well, let him ask. 
[01:50:00]  We got Darren in North Carolina.  Darren.  Hi, Darren.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Jimmy.  What's up?  Deep down, does it have anything to do with those two being alcoholics?  Do you not really wanting them to be inducted that way?  No.  Are you kidding me?  Not at all.  No, I want Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter inducted.  I want Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter to play.  I want a photo of Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter more than I want to re-sign and have more money  given to me.  I think he's asking if Gene's thinking that. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, no.  I don't think they care about that.  I think there's just been too much.  They don't care about the partying?  Because Gene is obviously dry.  He tells everybody.  Nah.  I mean, he's just how great he is, how he's never had a drop of alcohol or a drug.  Yeah.  It's stupid to be married.  Oh, that's right.  He ended up getting married.  Right.  No, I don't think it's that.  I think a big part of it is a lot of stuff has been said that is just really hard for  them to shake.  And I also think that Kiss is being truthful.  They're going on tour, and they don't want their tour with Def Leppard to be overshadowed 
[01:51:00]  by the fans going, fuck this, we want a reunion tour again, when the band is just kind of done  with each other.  Do you know what I mean?  That's my opinion on it.  That's it.  Gotta get it.  That's Def Leppard.  Oh.  That's Def Leppard.  Yeah.  What do you want to say?  Let's wrap this up.  I want a reunion tour more than I want anything. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I think Kiss is going to be the first franchise band.  I think you're right.  Man, also, because after another reunion tour, after the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, now what?  You've got to start thinking, you know, but if you reinvent the band with all brand new  young fucking guys in that make-  Franchised out.  Franchised out.  I think that would be a hot ticket.  A reboot?  A Kiss reboot?  A complete reboot, where every single one of those guys are gone, and then maybe every  once in a while, you know, Gene has a cameo at a concert or something. 
[01:52:00]  How cool would that be, though?  That would kind of be cool.  But they've got to get the right people, you know, they've got to really figure that  out, or it could be a bust.  But if they do it right, then it would go on for another 15, 20 years.  Forever, man.  Just keep doing it.  Right?  All right.  Yeah.  I think that's it for-  Oh, and then dumb Diddy.  Ugh.  Why is this news?  Diddy doing?  Hey, hey, hey.  Why is this news?  Who is Diddy?  I don't know who Diddy is.  Who is Diddy?  Diddy has a Puff Daddy fan. 
[01:52:30]  A Puff Daddy I like.  He has changed his name back to Puff Daddy.  Come on.  Well, there's a lot of controversy there.  Why?  Because he tweeted out, technically, he never officially changed his name to Diddy.  He's always been Puff Daddy.  And then started the hashtag, Diddy or Daddy.  So he wants everyone to get involved with the name thing?  That's right.  Really?  Oh, no.  I'm not full with that.  Take that.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Bad boys. 
[01:53:00]  He is terrible.  Diddy Dirty Money.  His decision to re-adopt his old name comes just before the release of his first album in four years, MMM.  Of course.  He's trying to fucking-  What's MMM mean?  Let me find out for you.  I'm not sure.  Roman numerals?  What is this?  I don't know.  Roman, when am I getting my Paul Stanley book?  I want to read it so I can interview him.  Please.  Please.  Oh, boy.  Puff Daddy.  There it is.  The hashtag, Diddy or Daddy.  That's right.  Or Doody. 
[01:53:30]  I choose Doody.  I'll just call him Doody.  Yeah.  All right.  Does anyone care?  I don't know what MMM stands for.  Yep.  Does anyone fucking care?  I do.  Does anyone remember laughter?  I'm about to find out.  Oh, oh.  Someone tweeted, the original name for Beth was Gertrude until Gene Chainson.  Gertrude.  Gertrude.  That would be an awful song.  Yep.  Hard to say.  Rick Rouse. 
[01:54:00]  He said what it stands for.  Oh, what is it?  Money-making Mitch.  Wow.  Taking a cue from the classic film Paid in Full.  Good one.  Not impressed?  It's podcast day.  Podcast number 46.  The Opie and Anthony podcast.  There's a link on O&A Show Twitter.  Right?  Yeah.  I'll retweet that.  But podcast number 46 is the best of 2004.  Right.  What was your guess?  Or a little look at 2004, because we had hundreds of hours of great radio in 2004. 
[01:54:30]  Hundreds.  And we only have, what, an hour and a half on this thing?  Right.  Did we ever have Diddy?  I don't know.  Did we ever talk to Diddy?  Did you guys go by the same name in 2004?  I think so.  We should have changed it to Diddy.  Yeah, I think so.  His album's going to be a Duddy.  Oh, Diddy.  I mean Puffy.  I don't care what he changes his name to.  I'll always call him the same thing.  The Bugatti Boys were in the studio.  Oh, I know.  What the thing is that? 
[01:55:00]  What?  Just one wonderful name.  Yes.  Sean Combs.  Sean Combs.  His given name.  Yep.  All right.  So there you go.  Go get our podcast, please.  It's very good.  They're all very good.  Yeah, but people don't have this one.  Oh.  The other ones are really good and people have them.  Right.  This one is really good and people don't have it.  And the thing is, it's free.  That's the best part.  Just download it on iTunes.  I'm thinking we should check our numbers. 
[01:55:30]  Sammy!  People love when we check the numbers.  No, they don't.  There's three things they love.  Us talking about free stuff we get.  Yeah.  Eating.  Yep.  And we're checking our numbers.  Podcast numbers.  Yeah.  I've seen people.  They go.  People.  Go through iTunes if you can.  Go to iTunes.  Go to iTunes.  Tap.  But Owen Day Show tweeted the link.  Thank you.  Is it the iTunes link, you son of a bitch?  People.  Just go to iTunes and search O.P. Anthony.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:00]  What's Rudy talking about?  Obamacare.  I got you.  And he hates de Blasio.  Say de Blasio's going to be the worst mayor in New York since Dinkins.  Moving New York in the wrong direction.  I think you said those guys that jumped were stupid.  He's the wrong kind.  The base jumpers were stupid.  They were stupid.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  We'll check our numbers during the break.  Yeah.  Check your numbers.  Because people always.  All right.  That's fine.  That's fine.  They complain.  They go, can we check the numbers along the way?  All right.  We got a Mount Everest guy coming in, too. 
[01:56:30]  What?  You rock.  What is he going to do?  Base jump from the top of Mount Everest or something?  That's pretty amazing.  That's exactly right.  I don't know how you do that.  Oh, ho, ho.  We're going to find out how you do that.  I mean, we're already getting some numbers on today's.  Oh, shit.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, ho, ho.  Looking at the numbers.  Where's Jimmy's?  With Chippa.  That's the only reason we do this.  Where's the Chippa one?  Where's Jimmy's numbers for I Hate Animals?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Where is it?  Whoa, Jimmy.  With Chippa.  Jimmy's, uh, wow. 
[01:57:00]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Jimmy's right up there as one of the best episodes of the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Top five, easy.  Maybe top three.  Oh, that'll help take a selfie, Caroline's.  Oh, boy.  No, it won't.  You want to plug that real fast?  No.  No.  I don't care.  Okay.  Beth, I hear you calling.  But I can't come home right now.  Cause me and the boys are doing some radio. 
[01:57:30]  And I can't find the sound.  Thank you.  Ain't it, ain't it.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back.  Hope you're having a good morning, whoever you are.  All these years later, I just find it extremely strange to talk into this and somewhere, someone's listening.  It's so bizarre. 
[01:58:00]  What else we got going on today?  What is in the old snoozeroni?  I want to thank Obama.  He's on the front page of the paper today.  Yeah.  My greatest fear, Manhattan nuke.  Thanks.  Yeah, a little atomic bomb in New York.  That's in the back of all of our minds.  Anyone that lives in New York, anyone that lives around New York, Long Island, Staten Island, you know the places. 
[01:58:30]  We all have it in the back of our heads.  We didn't need to have the president say it.  Well, this is our very contradictory president of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama.  Right.  He brings this up because a question was posed to him by the press that said, hey, Romney, during the debates for president, said that our biggest geopolitical enemy or concern is Russia. 
[01:59:00]  And now, and then Obama said something like, you know, oh, the 80s called and want their foreign policy back.  Look out.  But then it turns out Russia, you know, trying to annex parts of the Ukraine and, you know, it doesn't seem like he'll stop Putin.  He's got the world by the balls right now. 
[01:59:30]  He knows the United States is weak, weak leadership, military's being cut like crazy, so there's no real threat to him.  Right.  So, so, so, Obama was asked, hey, Romney said that Russia is a problem.  Do you agree with that now?  And he's like, well, they're kind of a regional thing, Russia.  Like, kind of blew off the whole thing that he's, he's annexing part of the Ukraine.  And, uh, and then, after all the shit he said about Al-Qaeda not being a threat, uh, during the election, and then he says, uh, well, our biggest problem is a nuke in New York City. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  So, what does he mean?  Which, which one does he mean?  I don't know.  Is, is, is, are we still under the threat of, uh, Muslim fucking terrorism?  Or, or not?  And is Russia a big problem or, or not? 
[02:00:30]  Is he deflecting a little bit?  I think he's, he's spent, uh, the past, uh, six years deflecting and deflecting.  That's all he does.  Now, with this Obama, I know what you're going to say, which is fine.  No, I'll give it, I'll, I'll use an open mind.  Try.  Is he, that piece of, what?  Is he that bad of a president?  Yeah.  Or is the system being exposed?  I think he doesn't know how to work the system. 
[02:01:00]  I think he's that bad of a president.  I don't believe.  You think other guys would be able to, you know, work it better in Washington?  Politically.  He's not good at playing politics.  He was one of those dumb community leaders.  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't think he's got much experience on working with people in the system.  And I, I think he's got these, those old workarounds.  He doesn't know how to do a workaround.  I think he's got these delusions that he's able to weaken the United States in the world's eye. 
[02:01:30]  And that will make people like the United States more because we're not like the, the big dog anymore.  You know?  Right.  Um, that's going to take a long time if he really believes that, but, but it doesn't work that way.  That would take generations.  I think if it worked, if it worked at all, right, that's not a quick thing.  I think it's very detrimental to the U S to not be a strong country, um, in a lot of ways  with strong leader and strong military.  I mean, you look at what, what, uh, uh, Afghanistan and Pakistan has been doing, uh, shenanigans 
[02:02:00]  on us of late.  And it's one of the biggest reasons is he doesn't, he doesn't have any lines of communication  open with these people, right?  It's just kind of, he's not a strong leader.  And, and, and you could talk about what you could do after Putin does his things.  And it's like, well, you can't really do anything.  You could, you could, uh, put sanctions on him and whatnot, but what are you going to invade?  No, obviously.  But the, the point is to not let him get to that point in the first place. 
[02:02:30]  And to do that, it takes very strong leadership and, um, uh, it's not so much us.  We're not really affected as much as our allies are in, in Europe.  They see shit like that and they're like, oh, great.  You know, we fucking, the Soviet union breaks up.  We go from Warsaw pack country to NATO countries and you guys don't seem to give a flying fuck  what this guy does anymore.  Right.  So it just looks bad.  I don't know. 
[02:03:00]  And I, but I also like Jimmy's point of, you know, don't fuck around with anything over  there.  Who gives a shit?  Let's take care of our own problems.  But unfortunately we are on this globe with a lot of other countries and, and we have to  interact with them.  Yeah.  I want the old Soviet union.  I really do.  I want a powerful Soviet union.  I like the fact that the rest of the world has such a hatred of the U S.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Let them, let them do what they want.  Now you guys will go.  Then you deal with them.  Yeah.  You deal with them.  You don't want to be nice and deal with us.  You deal with them.  You deal with the Russians.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Good for them.  Yeah.  I really mean that.  Good for Putin.  He doesn't give a fuck what the United States says and he shouldn't.  It's not our business what he does or how he runs his country.  Boy, I sure hope my trader isn't listening today.  Oh boy.  Why?  He's from the Ukraine.  He sees it very differently.  Ukraine is weak.  Well, of course he does.  He's not happy with the situation.  I don't blame him.  Oh boy.  I'm going to tell him it was all Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you nodded.  Even now, look at him.  He's nodding and smiling and pointing at the fucking trainer's picture.  Yeah.  He's from the Ukraine. 
[02:04:00]  And boy, he's all in.  He's Ukraine.  He's all in watching what's going on.  Yeah.  See how much of the Ukraine will be left.  I'm learning a little bit about the Ukraine through him, I guess.  I don't know.  I think the West is better than the East or something according to him.  Oh yeah.  Or is that because he's from the West?  That's probably why they love saying that.  Oh, it's much better.  Yeah.  What does this have to do with emu eggs, though?  Emu eggs?  What are they doing with those?  The restaurant community is getting just bored.  Oh, they don't?  Because at this point, every day, they're finding stuff that we decided a long time ago we don't 
[02:04:30]  want to eat.  We didn't want to eat it.  And now they're bringing it back to say, no, man, you've got to give it another try.  Great stuff.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's big, blue, and being gobbled up by adventurous diners.  Introducing emu eggs, New York City's latest dish du jour.  And what is so special about this?  It's five and a half inches long, three and a half inches wide, and it equals 10 to 12  chicken eggs.  That's pretty big.  A dozen eggs and one fucking egg.  So why weren't we eating emu eggs before now? 
[02:05:00]  Because they probably taste like dirt.  Exactly.  Plus they're blue.  Yeah.  Let's get one big emu egg.  Yeah, break it.  Step on it.  Smash it.  Smash it.  It's with a hammer.  Make an omelet.  Yeah.  It's something that people have never tried.  Something that people have never seen.  You know what the new snack is, too?  Like a really fancy one?  It's emu eggs.  And there's also the one where they take ostrich semen, and they spread it over the sweaty 
[02:05:30]  brim of a baseball hat, and you just lick it out.  You lick it out that way?  Yeah.  Unless it's dried.  Delish.  It is.  It weighs two pounds.  What a treat.  Would you eat a two-pound egg?  No.  Not at all.  That is a lot of egg.  Let's see.  They present it to the table whole and uncooked on what he calls a little nest of fresh spices.  Ew.  Spices that pinch your ass.  Whole and uncooked? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Ew.  What?  Ew.  That's got to be slimy.  I don't know.  Eat it, like, raw?  That's disgusting.  Poor emu's in there.  Pops his head out.  What are you doing?  It's my house.  It's so beautiful.  Is it going to hatch?  Which explains Allison, 43, a fitness instructor who lives in Maplewood, New Jersey, when she  first saw it?  Has she inserted it into her snatch?  Yeah.  What a dope this brought is.  What if some bird came shooting out?  She jokes.  Oh, she joked. 
[02:06:30]  Okay.  She jokes.  All right.  It's okay.  The birds and the bees, doesn't she?  Understand?  Mm-hmm.  So then they take it.  They show you, and then they take it back into the kitchen.  He cracks it open on the kitchen counter, as you might with a normal chicken egg, albeit  with more caution, and into a mixing bowl.  You have to be careful.  The shell is pretty thick, but it's not ostrich egg thick, says the chef, who loves working  with exotic eggs, and has also had turkey, ostrich, duck, and quail eggs on the menu at  various points. 
[02:07:00]  What makes chicken eggs like the ones we decided?  Like, that's, those are the ones we bought.  That's the shit.  They're easiest to kill, too.  Oh, yeah.  It's just dumb chickens.  Just running in a circle.  I guess they were easier to keep and domesticate, not domesticate, but keep on a farm.  Yeah.  Chickens, if you've got a bunch of emus running around, they're too big.  Watch that.  You've got to feed them too much to keep them alive.  It's probably not worth the feed for the egg that you get out of it.  Chickens must be more economical, that you get more out of them than you put into them. 
[02:07:30]  Plus, the way they a lot of times get these birds, is they'll put an ad, like on Backpage,  birds needed for modeling shoot, and chickens fall for it.  Do they always fall for it?  Always.  Those dumb chickens.  Yes.  What do they think they're modeling?  I don't know, but they want to be stars.  Chickens are really hams, as ironic as that sounds.  Which is very ironic.  I'm reading this whole article just to find out what it tastes like.  It doesn't just taste like an egg? 
[02:08:00]  Tastes like chicken.  What does it taste like?  I don't know.  And then the same chef has a Game of Thrones dinner.  Oh, no.  Part of a B-Y-O-B, guys.  Yeah?  Oh, no.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  What's the B- Oh, okay.  Uh, I don't know what it tastes like.  I guess it just tastes like fucking eggs.  It must just taste like a gamey egg.  Scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, scrambled...  What does it taste like? 
[02:08:30]  That's all I care about.  What's in the Game of Thrones dinner?  It was very rich and very decadent.  Decadent?  It's a bit on the creamy side.  I don't think I want my eggs to be creamy.  It is very succulent.  Even more succulent than I thought.  Succulent.  They bring the whole article together with this.  Yeah.  She just has one regret after trying the emu egg.  Uh-huh.  We should have asked to keep the shell.  Oh.  What'd she put in it?  A little fun for everyone.  You know.  It would smell. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  I saw somebody carve something very lovely out of a ostrich egg on television.  Was it a swastika?  Yes, it was a swastika.  He used a little Dremel tool and stuff.  And made a very cool, like, lattice work on it.  Oh, it was beautiful.  It was.  No.  Yes.  Oh, did you have a chip joke?  Oh, no.  That's what?  Put some tomatoes in it. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, of course.  You fucking retard.  I love it.  Goddamn chip.  Shit.  Hey, boy.  I want to ask this guy that's supposed to jump off of,  uh, Mount Everest there, uh, and he's wearing one of those, like, glide suits.  Oh, he's going with that?  I think that's what he's doing.  Wait, is it there?  Oh, God.  I hope I, I guess I sound dumb on a regular basis, but is there enough air for that suit? 
[02:10:00]  And that's what my question is.  Yeah, the air is very thin.  Now, if, if, you know, if you're trying to get away from a structure when you're base  jumping or something like that?  Right.  You need the lift.  You need to get away from it.  Right.  And to do that, you need, like, the wings to, to push you away.  If there's no air, uh, how does he know it's going to work?  I don't know.  That's why we interviewed these guys.  He really is going to use one of those?  Yeah, he's going to use one of those fucking wingsuits. 
[02:10:30]  And what happens with the wingsuit?  How do you fucking land eventually?  Well, you got to have a parachute.  Yeah.  But you can increase your forward, the ratio of forward movement to, uh, down movement.  Who figured out the wingsuit?  Someone had to try it for the first one.  Well, you're still falling a lot faster.  No, I know.  I get it.  Down than you're going forward.  Right.  But you could really get some good forward speed.  You've seen the wingsuit videos on YouTube, right?  Oh, yeah.  Where they come flying over the guy's head?  Yeah.  How the fuck they figure that out?  I don't know.  Or going through, like, a... 
[02:11:00]  A chasm.  A chasm or something.  Or cutting real close to the side of a mountain.  And they know they got it.  Oh, they better.  There's one where his friend's waiting down the hill and he's got the camera.  And you see this fucking thing go flying over his head.  It seems like a couple feet tops.  He's going...  It looks like 100 miles an hour easily.  Can you find that one?  I know that...  That's all I got on it.  How many bad wingsuits were made?  Guys just splatted at the bottom?  Oh, yeah.  Giant feathers?  They could be very dangerous if you, uh...  You know, you'll have one arm out and the other one in. 
[02:11:30]  And you just start spinning to the point where you...  Right.  You'll get knocked out.  Does the blood flow fly up to your head?  Like, just because you're wearing that doesn't mean you don't have to pay attention to where  your arms are and your legs.  How do you get the suit open, then?  Oh, I've seen this one.  The one that goes horribly wrong.  Oh, shit.  He was fooling around, doing some gymnastics, and then, uh...  He was on, like, a parallel bar.  Right.  That's real.  And the whole thing broke.  Did that guy die?  Did he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  See a suit open. 
[02:12:00]  So why was the other guy on the ground crying if everyone was all right?  That's probably why.  He's very different.  I would fall.  Yes.  Let me say hi to David in Boston.  David.  Hey, I just want to make a comment about those exotic eggs in those restaurants.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, you know why they don't serve duck eggs anymore?  Why?  Because the shells are too hard to quack.  Ah, gotcha.  No, it's because when someone would say duck eggs, everybody would hit the floor.  Expect eggs to come flying by. 
[02:12:30]  Plus, too much mayhem in the restaurants.  Jeff in North Carolina.  Jeff.  Hey, we were out in Arizona, and then there was, like, an ostrich farm out there, and  it's one of the places that served, like, ostrich omelets and stuff like that, so I had  some.  And it's very light and delicate.  It's very fluffy, airy.  You know, it's very tender.  It's delicious, you know.  Probably prepared the right way.  But have you had ostrich meat yet?  Yeah.  Oh, I have.  It's amazing.  Have you?  No.  I would assume you would have by now. 
[02:13:00]  I've never had ostrich meat.  It's some of the best steak you could ever eat.  The best steak.  When you coat your hand in sugar, and then you have an ostrich shit into your palm.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What the fuck?  You're not.  Why would he do that?  You're not going into the Hall of Fame with us.  Fuck you.  Why would he do that?  It's just a bit of delicate.  Jesus. 
[02:13:30]  Shellacazade.  Got to try that.  Yeah.  Sounds great.  Absolutely.  There have been a couple guys that have landed without the parachute.  I thought so.  They attempted that shit.  Well, that must be a hell of a grade on the way down.  Mike.  Mike A.  Yo.  Hi, buddy.  I thought I heard this.  You're good.  With the wingsuit or whatever.  A couple guys have landed without the parachute?  Yeah.  There's a guy who's landed in cardboard boxes, I believe, on a football field. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, okay.  I saw that.  What do you mean?  They piled up a shitload of empty cardboard boxes, and he hit that.  Oh, that's cheating a little bit.  Yeah.  There's also another guy who just did it on water, no parachute.  So, I know they're both on YouTube.  You guys should check it out.  I would think the water one is fake.  Really?  And if you're going to...  Because that's like carcrete.  Everyone always says that.  Dude, you're falling at a rate...  You're not even doing a...  I don't know what the ratio is, but it's...  You're falling a lot more feet per second than you're going forward feet per second. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  But either way, you guys should check it out.  If you can't, you should start playing Battlefield instead of Call of Duty.  Step it up, buddy.  Yeah, Battlefield.  Oh, look, I'm driving a tank.  You got to step it up, dude.  I got to step it up.  I told you.  No problem.  Sam, can you make that bigger?  No, no, your penis.  This is the one that lands on water.  Does he use...  The people are all pointing and watching. 
[02:15:00]  That's a pretty cool video.  I want you to see.  You look badass.  Wow, you really are moving fast.  I don't believe that.  You don't...  No, the camera work's too weird.  I don't believe it.  I don't buy it either.  I'm not believing it.  It doesn't look right.  The camera work is too fucking jumpy.  Dude, the camera work is fucking...  Yeah, it's jumpy.  There's all kinds of people there.  That's bullshit.  That should have been fucking like a great view.  If you're going to do that...  You would have like four different cameras. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I think you're right.  That was horse shit.  You would set that up proper.  Yep.  You're falling.  You're not flying in those suits.  You're fucking falling.  It gives you a lot of control, and you get more forward motion, but...  Can you go up?  You still get...  No.  No.  There's no way to...  No way.  You are falling.  You are fucking falling.  That's fast, too.  What's this guy doing?  That's crazy.  This guy's falling out of parachutes.  He's holding his parachute?  Yeah, I think this is the one where...  Oh, come on.  What are they duking that?  The one guy lets go, and then this guy puts his parachute on while he's falling. 
[02:16:00]  Holy shit.  I would never do that.  Why would you do that?  Do you see the one with the guy...  I'm sorry.  Do you see the one with the guy jumping out of the plane?  There he goes.  Look.  That guy...  Oh, what the hell?  Oh, he doesn't even...  Wait.  There's no way he held on to it.  He's just holding the parachute in his hands.  Oh, fuck that.  I've never seen this one.  He pulled the ripcord.  Now he's just hanging by the... 
[02:16:30]  Come on.  What the fuck?  But is he tethered at all?  No, he's not.  I don't know.  It didn't look like he was.  Yeah, the guy gives him his parachute, and then the guy pulls the cord.  And now he's hanging upside down?  And now he's just hanging from his parachute.  He's not, you know, connected.  Imagine just...  And you fall out of it.  That's all I'm thinking.  So you're just done.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There's no getting back.  We're officially bored.  This guy has really good fucking hand strength, though.  That's crazy.  It's amazing.  That looks real. 
[02:17:00]  That one looked real.  So we're going to talk to the Everest guy.  Yeah.  He's going to try a pretty incredible stunt.  He's going to jump from the top.  I wonder how long it takes to get down.  Is it officially a base jump?  Oh, no.  You said wingsuit, didn't you?  Yeah, he's going to wear a wingsuit, but I think it's still a base jump.  He'll be in studio in about 20 minutes, 30 minutes.  Right, correct.  And we'll see.  Yeah.  We'll ask him questions.  You heard about the girl shaving her head?  What's she doing?  Oh, my God.  How annoying is that school?  It's the no-tolerance policy bullshit that we've talked about a million times in this 
[02:17:30]  show.  I miss that story.  Girl shaves her head.  She's a big Jim Norton fan.  To show support for her friend with cancer.  Oh, that.  This happens all the time.  Sure.  I remember growing up, people would just shave their head for support for their friends  or mom or something, dad, whatever.  School tells her a bald head violates their dress code and she can't come back without a wig.  School bows to pressure and reverse course.  What?  School bows to pressure and reverse course.  I know a place you could go where they stay on, even in hurricane force wings. 
[02:18:00]  It's not a commercial.  Absolutely.  Side phone.  No, Maury's wigs.  Maury's.  Oh, that's right.  Maury's wigs.  Yeah, but they did buckle, though, as they should have.  The school buckled?  They could get a wig.  Oh, God, yeah, they had to.  It looks pretty good.  Check.  You could get a wig over there, too, though.  Kids have been shaving their heads for cancer forever.  Yeah, but girls trying to support a friend.  Oh, my God.  It's a scumbag school, wants to do something.  What fucking asshole looks at that and goes, yeah, we got to suspend you? 
[02:18:30]  That's really...  So they eventually did, like, suspend her or tell her she can't come back.  I think so, yeah.  Until they, you know, did the right thing and figured it out, right?  This guy wants to sniff Lady Di's ass on the air.  She's not here.  Yes.  Exactly.  I guess she's doing better or the Lady Di thing.  I talked to her yesterday on the post show.  Yeah.  She's just making excuses as to why she can't get the blood work done that Dr. Steve wants.  I know.  She's not doing better.  Of course not.  I know.  She's making excuses, right? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a drunken goose egg.  You're going to see this guy drop a joke on the people's court?  Yeah.  Okay.  Fucking awesome.  What is D's nuts?  Don't spoil the punchline, Jim.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Who cares?  I didn't mean to.  Did it work back?  Well, it's good to see you alive.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know.  Maybe this guy was on something.  Maybe D hit him.  Who knows?  He was calling you the suspect.  You see?  You know?  I don't know. 
[02:19:30]  Like I said, D hit him.  So it wasn't me.  What's D?  D's nuts.  He's a guy's crazy.  D what?  Huh?  D's nuts.  Harvey?  The key here is you cannot try the same issue in a different court.  You get one bite in the apple.  That will do it for this case.  And that's Harvey.  So this was filmed years ago, right?  Harvey doesn't.  He doesn't still do that show.  He still does it.  No, he doesn't.  I mean, he films like 100 episodes in one shot.  Right.  Oh, but he's still doing it.  Oh, he got him.  Harvey!  He got him so bad. 
[02:20:00]  D's nuts.  That's always a classic.  D's nuts.  I don't understand the D's nuts.  Oh, my friend D's will clear it up for you.  Who?  D's nuts.  You get that one, Travis?  I got it.  Got me good.  Sam and I love D's nuts.  Yeah, I know you do.  We do them all day.  I got one.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  Fucking, uh, I have some A's, some B's, some C's, and some D's.  Oh, okay.  Yeah?  Yeah, these fucking peckers. 
[02:20:30]  What?  Don't ruin these nuts.  Eric in Colorado.  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, that story you just brought up about that girl?  Yeah.  The school board voted last night three to one to let her back in, and the guy, the dissenting  vote, he's pissed that they let her back in, saying that zero tolerance means zero tolerance.  But the guy came off just sounding like a complete and total douchebag.  Well, can we take a look?  The guy's obviously an absolute jerk-off. 
[02:21:00]  Of course.  He really is, yeah.  If you listen to his comments on that, he just, there's like, the one TV station this  morning played like a short clip, and I've heard a longer clip where he just sounded  like a complete and total asshole.  Sam, look up, um, what's wrong with these people?  Cancer Wig School dissenting.  God, what a scumbag.  I would, I would homeschool if I didn't have to do all the work.  See, right.  You know what I mean? 
[02:21:30]  Really?  That's the problem with homeschooling.  Now you're the teacher all the time.  What?  Fuck that.  Exactly.  Why is that against school policy?  How the fuck are they going to tell you that your hair is wrong?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Especially at that age.  They're just like kids.  It's not like a high school, like, skinhead guy coming in and fatigues.  Yeah, it's not like they were trying to get D's to come in.  Who?  D's?  D's nuts.  Oh, shit.  Damn it.  You got us again on that.  I nailed him.  I keep falling for it.  You're good.  Amazing.  Damn.  Just as good as our own wall thing.  Let's hear what the guys say. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, what happened?  All right.  This is the news.  Let's see the news story.  Sammy!  I did it already.  Oh.  Got booted from school for going bald for her friend.  Cameron Renfrow shaved her head in solidarity with her friend Delaney Campbell, who's going  through chemotherapy.  Something the girl's mother called very brave.  Friends support each other no matter what.  And this is a very brave little girl, and we should all support her in that fact that she  made that decision. 
[02:22:30]  And it is a big deal.  It's a very big deal.  It sure is.  The school says Cameron broke their dress code because her head was apparently too distracting  to the other students.  She couldn't go to class.  How is that distracting more than the first maybe hour?  Well, how about that?  They changed, they turned that around after a huge support for both of these girls.  Well-placed support.  Who was the one that said we have to?  I wanted, that's what I want to see.  Like, yeah, who's the one?  I bet if you asked, they would pass that buck around like they do around here.  Oh, no, it wasn't me. 
[02:23:00]  It was upstairs.  It was, oh, no, it's a policy made by, but who was the one that said suspend her?  What?  Oh, that was, no, it was a thing.  It was a consortium of people and things that we, they never have a person.  What?  Assholes.  Amazing.  I want to know the dissenting, I got to hear this guy.  Yeah.  If we can find it, we'll play it for you, Jimmy.  Yes.  We'll take a little look around.  Do you, uh, look-see?  Do you see the Nancy Grace thing?  I did not.  I heard about that.  Oh, God, you got to.  Can I play it from here?  Or do you want to play it from there?  Yes, I should play it from there. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, we don't like Nancy Grace.  What?  I don't understand why she has an audience, because it seems like most people don't like  Nancy Grace.  She's hateable, too.  She's extremely hateable, is absolutely right.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, she's on the Oscar Pistorius, uh, trial, and she's blaming it on porno, I know  that much.  That's right.  She was watching porn that night or whatever?  She was watching porn, what, she had a problem with that?  Yeah, she wants to make, not only does she have a problem with that, but she wants to  make it...  Did the girlfriend have a problem with it?  Reva Steenkamp.  I don't think that it is as much a part of the case as Nancy Grace would like it to be. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  He's obviously a very jealous guy, and they told a story about him at a party where he...  If you had no legs, you'd be jealous, too.  Well, yeah.  If anybody with, she's most of the earth.  I think you would have a tough time with that if you had no legs.  Sure.  You would put up a good front, but I think deep down inside you'd be a bit of a jealous person.  Yeah.  Fucking legs.  You got a hot chick like that?  Right.  He's got legs.  Especially if she compliments people's legs.  Oh, yeah.  Like, if she's always looking at people's cabs and magazines.  Look, that guy's got nice toes. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And she looks at your spatula feet, breaks out the Pam.  All he got is sweatpants for Christmas.  He has shorts.  No shorts for you.  Feedy pajamas.  It'd be like not having D's.  You know what I know?  D's what?  D's not.  God damn it.  She's going to get caught.  She gets caught again.  I got to say, though.  You see it more and more.  That fake leg is badass.  It's pretty amazing what they've been able to figure out. 
[02:25:00]  When you watch that guy run with those fucking...  Not the spatula legs.  No, when you watch him run with the spatula legs, it's amazing.  Right.  But, yeah, they're making ones look pretty good.  But they figured out how to make the fake knee move naturally and the ankle even.  Pretty good.  There's a roll to the walking now.  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing.  This is what Nancy Grace had to say.  Somehow using his cell phone at 1.48 in the morning.  Don't look for porn, Dad. 
[02:25:30]  Porn.  Well, okay.  Whatever it was for, though, he was claiming that they were asleep in bed at 10 p.m. that night.  Can you imagine waking up to that voice?  Are you awake yet?  They were born.  Oh, that's a horrendous voice.  Horrendous.  Do you want to try to sneak one in at the end, too?  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  It was porn.  What a fucking...  Rob my feet!  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:26:00]  Meanwhile, she showed her big tit on national television.  Yes, she did.  Remember when her filthy nipple came out?  Yes.  Slutty nipple.  Dancing with the stars.  Yeah.  What type of behavior is that?  As much as I hate her.  I don't think that happened.  I don't think she meant for that to happen.  Maybe she didn't, but she wasn't cautious enough.  And who the fuck was actually turned on by that?  Look at that right there.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Pornographic nipple.  She didn't cover it, did she?  No.  Apparently not, because it's showing...  That's probably what that dude was looking at on his phone. 
[02:26:30]  Porn!  Oh, my God.  Would you do that?  No.  Oh, God.  No way.  She is a fat pig.  Oh, she's just fine.  She's a man.  Porn.  Fine.  She continues here.  Dan, Nancy, we thank you both.  I noticed neither of you want to touch it with a 10-foot pole that he was up trolling the  internet for porn just before he kills her, but I'll save that for another day.  Actually, Nancy, we just have to get to the weather.  But we want to thank you both.  So, uh...  Stupid slob. 
[02:27:00]  What do you mean they didn't want to go with that?  Whatever.  But you think that's risky to talk about porn being a culprit?  I think every single human being looks at porn.  Not Nancy Grace.  Oh, God damn it.  I got a tweeter.  Tweet-a-le-le-le-le-le-le.  Nice.  I like your tweets, Nancy Grace.  I live for them.  They are fun.  I wish we wouldn't hold back as much, though.  I know.  I just...  I want her to like me.  You want to get on our show?  Yeah.  She is so consistently wrong with every case.  Yeah.  It's fantastic. 
[02:27:30]  I found the name of the guy who voted against.  letting that girl back in school oh his name's bill newcomer newcomer it's not yes it is i swear  to god there's no way it's a newcomer and what is bill newcomer cast the dissenting vote saying  his decision had nothing to do with the girl i believe caprock has a mission and a vision  and that mission and vision elevates critical thinking and puts it above emotionally charged  decision what a hunk of it's not an emotionally charged decision it's a it's the right decision 
[02:28:00]  hang on we're only halfway through maybe we'll agree with the next my fear is this sets a  president and nudges us down a path that we don't want to follow slippery slope right because we we  we don't have the moral courage to make uh a decision here or a decision there it's all or nothing gotta  be sure all under one handy umbrella i fuck are we done with that sure sorry i wouldn't hear him i  fucking hate the nfl yeah oh did you are you reading about the uh yes yeah i read that 
[02:28:30]  what the fuck are they doing they're great they're ridiculous what the fuck are they doing they're  great fuck sportsmanship i love when a team rubs it in the other team's face and that isn't even bad  that's just what are they doing the cemetery it's cemetery goal post dunks i just i did not see this  before this very moment a good one uh goal post dunks will draw flags now you know guy scores a touchdown  he goes for that goofy dunk over the goal post yeah you grab it slam dunk it why is that a problem 
[02:29:00]  who is bothered by that i believe they have a problem with using the football as a prop in any  way shape or form the um they made a rule about it a while back but this one kind of was grandfathered  in the dunking thing right so then they just recently now decided now that's got to go too  they don't like they have a reason for it all being used what's the reason what is the reason  the reasoning is that uh it's if you if you hit the goal post sometimes it will make the goal post 
[02:29:30]  uneven oh shut up that's not the reason and they're sorry this is what they're saying and there have  been times especially last season where the game had to be stopped because they had to realign  the goal post there's always a reason instead of saying look we're a bunch of babies so now it falls  under the the prop rule which you could still do like the lambo leap that was grandfathered in  with the goal post what's the lambo leap that's where they go jumping into the stands yeah they do  that in green bay and but other other uh players are not doing it but it started in green bay where 
[02:30:00]  they jump right in and the guys grab you hold you for a little bit give you a nice man hug and then  oh nice let you go what are they making the goal posts out of it's like toothpicks right  yeah it's just paper it's yeah it's paper paper mache but if you're a kicker when you notice it's  a little off and go okay a little off so i gotta adjust a little bit it's still a goal post yeah  i gotta get it in between those two things it's papier mache yeah that was it papier mache 
[02:30:30]  it's so many references i know so they're not allowing you to dunk it yeah using the ball as a  prop or any object as a prop whether that's the goal post the crossbar that will come out and that  will be a foul next season i love all that even if it's against your team you respect it and love  it take all the spontaneous fun out of everything let's do that because you know it's a matter of  time before your team gets to shove it in their face yeah sports which is very important oh christ  almighty look sports machine call oh the graham good for graham he's a saint his name's jimmy graham 
[02:31:00]  he's the one that really uh likes that dunking thing he says he tweeted tuesday i guess i'll have to  lead the nfl in penalties next year oh he is a saint i hope he does it continues it he must like  doing that for people of the country bad example for children oh i wish you would shinkle about  shutting the up oh man he also tweeted a picture of a photoshopped picture of a referee jumping to 
[02:31:30]  block his attempt to dunk a ball over the crossbar did a referee really do that no it was oh okay but  then he later deleted the tweet so obviously the team or somebody got to him said look man get rid  of that don't again again you know don't have any fun oh god it's unbelievable it's a it's a sport we  say it every time where they they're trying to remove each other's heads every single play meanwhile  the jets just signed a psychopath yeah yeah exactly yeah it's just don't dunk the football it's in 
[02:32:00]  poor case don't dunk the football drown a dog and electrocute him and allow him back in the league  yeah but he did his talk you know yeah he did but there's so many guys that still have committed  felonies if that's if the nfl wants to clean up these lying scumbags anyone convicted of a felony  cannot be a part of your league there's your morality clause take football back to the  fucking why not early days but why not you know what i mean if that's how you want to do it then do it  yeah wouldn't spinning the ball in the end zone be using the ball as a prop yes i think i think most 
[02:32:30]  of that stuff is becoming a no-no are you allowed to even spike the ball anymore yeah but it's it has  to be done very like i'm from the 50s or 60s really quick i don't think it can be towards the other team  right you can't really showboat it i think that came out last year can you go into the end zone put  the ball down on the ground next to you and take one knee like they used to when they scored a  touchdown they had to like right do that wacky little move i think you should be able to walk 
[02:33:00]  up to the opposing quarterback's mother in the stand and punt the football up under her skirt  that's what you should do that's how you should uh that's good  put in like a nice celebration i i just don't understand their reasoning on any of this stuff i  don't like it i hate sportsmanship because you know inside they hate the other team and  really love the fact they beat the out of them but then they have to go on camera like you know 
[02:33:30]  i gotta get handed to my opponent you know they came to play right well we were the better team  today but but no disrespect because they're a good team too but what i'm saying here is that well they're  just saying horrible things about them and their family of course and i'm okay with all that  jimmy graham dunks the ball because he used to play college basketball all right i figured there was  some kind of basketball connection there sure what about this uh dan b bio bondi this one oh i just 
[02:34:00]  it's that guy he's just some guy i think it's an internet radio show he does like some uh conservative  radio show right yeah and it's in rhode island i believe and he was outside uh one of those senator  meeting deals and he got in the senator's face and was asking about the second amendment  and i thought the senator's response was very funny oh yeah the second amendment shall not be  in friends you people need to understand that yeah go fuck yourself i'm sorry thank you 
[02:34:30]  oh  what the fuck that's the senator uh that's the senator's response yes what is he what do you think  he's in house of cards good for him too that's crazy you know that i was getting in his face you  should be able to say go fuck yourself he thought that was his kevin spacey internal monologue  right camera and i realized it came out you know to everybody oh no oh let me uh why don't you go 
[02:35:00]  fuck yourself rock hair in the airport yeah you can fuck yourself rock her in the airport uh steve the  therapist you guys were talking about the backlash that uh that young girl got because she shaved her  head right well uh it uh haven middle school in everston illinois uh they banned leggings and yoga  pants and uh the girl just saying that it was too distracting for the boys oh um it's probably 
[02:35:30]  true there's amazing well yeah that look that look is amazing man oh my god no everybody's walking  around now with just the the yoga pants on no i mean if you're a boy that age and you got your  your classmate girls wearing yoga pants you're gonna be out of control  so yeah you say bad yoga pants no no good what do we have to look at  no you had no idea what the girl's body looked like until you took everything off and went oh wow

[02:37:30]  ah it's adorable i hope believe me i hope that your relationship with him ends the same way  as this tiger and roy uh yeah i don't want him to rip my throat out you know what their story on the  tiger was i'm reading that they're delusional to this day yeah let me give you a few facts uh tigers  live between 15 and 26 years when we have them in captivity he was uh manticore was 17 but they did 
[02:38:00]  call monty core monty yeah after uh they were they were big monty hall fans oh is that it i stopped the  show for that yeah horn 69 and and partner zig zigfree 74 have said they believe monty core  sensed horn was having a mini stroke and was dragging him to safety because he knows what  the stroke is oh there you go rather than attacking him animal experts have disputed that theory there 
[02:38:30]  you go you're in denial man i drank him by his face yeah that's what you do is not having a stroke  yeah make it worse make it worse by their flesh and yeah yeah yeah just paul grabbed his feet and  pulled them off because he thought that he was having some sort of a heart issue yeah thanks for nothing  i will forever believe it was his concern for my safety and well-being that caused him to act as  he did on that night long ago we spent many hours together and he never failed to bring me great joy  and wonderment it was my great honor to be uh beside him at the end he is now playing with his siblings 
[02:39:00]  in white tiger heaven oh is that white tiger heaven that's nice how is how is uh how is he does he  speak better horn and all that he must be i don't know he's fucked up they gave up that gig dude no one  has really seen him much i mean he must be a disaster that sucks that uh monkey that ripped the lady's  ripped the lady's face off he sensed an ingrown hair in her nose oh really that's all it was  trying to get to her on hair and he was trying to pull it out yeah uh and then he figured he'd use her 
[02:39:30]  thumbs to do it so he had to rip those off of her hands no he thought that her like thumbs like  those little juice tops that you pull off and drink oh you give a little beverage there yeah  he thought there was a delicious beverage in her hand those are pictures of him after the accident  oh i think so oh boy was that him oh he don't look that bad well he looks fatter right as opposed to  good yeah wow it looks like he's stuck in that facial expression now what a fatso 
[02:40:00]  well well i think it might have to do with the fact that a tiger  bit his face obviously didn't bite his fucking what in the tan of thyroid gland  fucking how fat is he how do you expect the other good looking one to keep  fucking you oh poor guy keep  fucking exactly what are they partners oh boy i hope so he was just in business i'm sure  wow uh yeah killed him exactly treating each other as coccyx harmonicas let's see rich in florida 
[02:40:30]  this goes back to jimmy's point rich go ahead yeah the uh jim ursa is the owner of the uh  cults he was pulled over i think last week uh for dui and had possession of uh illegal substance faces up to  four felony charges and uh he's the one that is the notorious tweeter that has his holier than thou  tweets about shit that goes on in the nfl and but you don't hear the nfl saying much about that that's

[02:42:00]  best material of 2004 plus an hour we'll be back with more opian anthony thank you thanks  jesus jimmy who who ruined that uncle paul bit what do you mean who went in there and put all  that extra shit in there it's always been like that no it has not that music absolutely not two  years old but i haven't heard that i've never heard that version with the music in it and with the uh 
[02:42:30]  that words at the end i've never heard that as far as i know we've never gone into a piece of  production and then changed that uncle paul bit with the jordash music i've never heard that dude  i don't remember either but none of us do that was changed did sal do that yeah it was south well  but i asked him no he didn't no we don't go in and edit bits after they've already been on the air  that's horrendous that's just how it's always been oh i never noticed it i mean i never heard it 
[02:43:00]  it i think you should pay more attention jim i do no you don't promise i'm always here bell's on  ready to go i know this song is fun um is the guy here um yeah yeah yeah let me get a couple bites  in i think that's him let me wait for a second he's gonna fly fly like a bird oh there we go 
[02:43:30]  how you doing sir right take a seat right there that's it you have the look here's the look that  of a guy who's gonna do something crazy like uh daredevil yeah thing going on thanks yeah yeah i've  been getting that a lot lately oh yeah yeah well this is uh quite amazing well we gotta start with how  do you pronounce your name joe b o gwinn joe b o gwinn all right and you're gonna jump from the top of the  uh uh mount evers i am i'm gonna try that's uh that's like a few stunts in one it is kind of like 
[02:44:00]  just getting up there is kind of a problem oh yeah let's start there you you've been to the top of a  bunch of times right three times three expeditions there this is the fourth one yeah three expeditions  the the youngest guy ever to do it i heard i was the youngest american wow they have subcategories oh yeah  it's like oh that's it oh it's american no of course that's incredibly impressive but you also did 
[02:44:30]  it without oxygen uh i tried it without oxygen i got within about 300 feet of the top and had to turn  around because the a storm was blowing wow but i had gone from base camp to almost the top in like  ten and a half hours i was doing a speed ascent without oxygen and solo no sherpas no ropes no none of  that no ropes no ropes yeah just free climbing everything yeah so it was it was even i didn't  get those last few few hundred feet it was still probably one of my more impressive but who else 
[02:45:00]  was up there couldn't you just say you did it the yeti was up there you know yeah it was like the yeti  but without ropes i mean how dangerous does it get how how narrow do some of those areas get when you're  climbing well this was on the north side so it's kind of the north face so it's everything's a little  bigger and more wide open the south side which i'll climb for this particular project for discovery  is a little more narrow and sharper on the ridge so it's it's definitely hard i love mount everest 
[02:45:30]  stuff so how many how many people die a year doing this or attempting oh plenty um  um every year yeah i mean there's never been a year that people haven't died right to the top and  they're also talking about finally cleaning up the bodies yeah well it's kind of hard to do  it's kind of hard to do anything at 26 27 000 feet you know where they're at up there so it's kind of  hard to justify spending a bunch of money and risking guys lives and you've obviously seen the bodies right 
[02:46:00]  oh yeah they're well marked they're actually used as markers there are some that are used as landmarks  almost yeah which is kind of sad yeah true yeah make a left at ed it's kind of frightening left it's  like it's like old blue gloves and green boots there's a guy green boots i've seen green boots  i forgot what some website did all a whole thing on a lot of the bodies that you see as you're climbing  i couldn't believe it yeah i mean they're they're frozen and wedged in there pretty good so it's more 
[02:46:30]  like just don't disturb them and you know the one green boots guy you have to actually step over him to get  where you're going so why wouldn't people move him to the side a little bit he has moved to the side  a little bit he's kind of in what they call the cave area which is a place it's kind of a protected  place but you know what you see is a lot of these guys they just get exhausted they make it to the  top or close to the top yeah trying to get down and they just sit down in the snow and they just  which is harder getting up or down because getting down seems like it'll be harder because you can't  see where you're putting your foot kind of that's kind of true um the only thing that keeps me 
[02:47:00]  going down is the motivation of usually having gotten to the top you're kind of stoked that you're  that you made it work so you're excited to get back down and get out of there now green boots  has a family like they never try to figure out how to get his body down yeah i mean they might have  but um i mean i know other people who have tried to do that but it's it's just you would have to spend  the hundreds of thousands of dollars and if you don't have that kind of money right to be able to  do it it would be a massive undertaking because you you'd have to yeah i mean most of these guys are 
[02:47:30]  very close to the top i also hear that um people die because there's like log jams and stuff  well that's the problem in the last several years is there's way too many people up there and 99 out  of 100 of them shouldn't be there in the first wow really yeah and there's a lot of people that are  holding you up and you you know you only have a certain amount of time and then the the becomes  some kind of log jam as you're waiting for people to come back down yeah from some of these narrow areas  that you have you have to get through yeah right up near the top is where it really gets tight 
[02:48:00]  and unfortunately you know there's there's just too many people doing it but the country needs the  money they're one of the poorest countries in the world that's one of their main revenue so they're  just like hey anybody that's really much how is it how much does it cost like let's say that we want  to do it how much would it cost us the cheapest you're going to get is like you know 30 grand a person  and you're not going to be having a very good time at base camp because you're going to be eating rice  and lentils the whole time you know you know it's not a high-end trip but if you want to go and do 
[02:48:30]  it the right way and have the best support at 65 you know and up 65 grand so you know for us hopefully  we'll be able to be a really tight fast lightweight team and we can be well ahead of most of those guys  one more question before we get into your stunt how how long can you stay at the top before you really  got to turn around the very tip top you know if you got plenty of oxygen you can stay for you know a  couple hours at the most you know but most people when you realize you get to the top you realize  how far away you are from everything and you just want to get back down photos and then you're out of 
[02:49:00]  there what's the average stay time like 15 minutes or so um something like that 15 20 minutes probably  like that now i i stayed up there an hour one time the first time i actually did it because we just had  such perfect weather i was enjoying it and describe that describe the feeling of being up there for an hour  more or less by yourself i mean some people are coming and going obviously but i was through your  mind because the first time i did it uh actually all three times that i've been up there i found  myself alone or with just one or two other people so i had a really nice experience in that but it i 
[02:49:30]  mean the feeling is great because you you know you're as far away from everybody and all your problems  and issues and normal life as you can possibly be so that that part of it at least for me is a really  great feeling just you're you're just away from everything how big is the area up there like you said  there's a couple of people like it like when you're standing on the tip how big of an area do  you have if you're standing on the tip top uh you know it's like a little snow cone so two people can  stand on the tip top but if the area right right below it is actually where i'll be and where i'll  jump from you know so it's it's pretty big i mean you could it's a couple maybe three or four times 
[02:50:00]  the size of this room how far is that from the top of the snow cone it's right there you know as soon  as you kind of walk down a little bit it expands out so the area you know can can accommodate lots  of people it's just that the area below that to get to that top the little ridge to the summit is  very tight 300 i'm i'm still stuck on 300 feet so you can look up and just see it and how much  longer would that have taken you that's the problem at that altitude it doesn't sound like a very long  distance it's not i had actually done all the climbing i just kind of walk on football but it 
[02:50:30]  would have been an hour and a half or something like that minimum yeah because minimum hour and a  half to go 300 feet at that height climbing without oxygen all alone yeah an hour and a half  why do you just get completely out of breath really quickly or you yeah you just like you're  kind of in slow motion you start to hallucinate a little bit you're kind of seeing things i was  watching little gremlins crawling around that obviously weren't there you know so your maybe  your mind's playing tricks on you a little bit yeah maybe they were i've seen a yeti too yeah  the yeti or his north american sasquatch no no i've seen wait he said he saw yeah i thought you're just 
[02:51:00]  joking about that shit everybody always thinks i am but it's totally true 2004 in tibet i was  climbing the sixth highest mountain in the world it was a full moon walked right out of my tent there  he was come on a yeti and what'd you say i say a yeti because i think he's not the yeti because there  must be more than one but it looked like a little bear and then so why wasn't it just a little bear  left well the reason i realized it wasn't a bear is because it sat there for about 10 seconds and then 
[02:51:30]  drove away i couldn't believe what i was seeing i was like but when it left it took one big leap and it  and it jumped over a mountain of rocks it must have been 300 feet high so it just like disappeared  well sure it didn't fly it looked like it was flying that i i was standing there with 10 other  people though so it wasn't like i mean it's crazy it didn't jump 300 feet it looked like it took  two steps and went up and out of there and they also rocks everybody with me saw it even the the 
[02:52:00]  sherpa cookboy just said don't don't go up there that was his exact words so they all believe in the  yeti the sherpas and stuff oh yeah yeah i mean i think it's a real they're not dumb people no no  they're not super educated but they live in an area where right they know their surroundings is what  i mean yeah they know their surroundings sure and they believe yeah and you believe now i'm a believer  now yeah william shatner uh saw one of those yeah it's on the wing of an airplane  was the air thin when you saw the yeti i got a challenge on this a little bit they're like i knew i 
[02:52:30]  let the can out there on that one no uh i was at base camp so it wasn't like uh you know we weren't  but i had summited twice on this mountain and i had just done a speed ascent and it was a full moon  but you know it was a strange thing thing came me i actually came up and shook the tent i was in  we thought it i was sitting there with with having dinner with like 10 or 12 other guys from spain  friends of mine and something grabbed the tent started shaking it the corner of the tent i was sitting in 
[02:53:00]  and we thought oh it's a buddy of ours he's gonna somebody's gonna walk in and when nobody walked  in we're like the hell was that so we walked all walked out of the tent to go and look at  and everybody was kind of staring at it i said what are you guys staring at and boom there it was how  big it's big i mean it was crouched down and it seemed to be about like that that's about what four  four feet high i think if it stood up it'd be a lot taller at first i thought it was a yak because  they bring in these big furry yaks to carry all the equipment out and it was the end of the expedition  i was then i quickly realized this is not a yak you gotta shoo it away don't come back 
[02:53:30]  i was just curious why what what it wanted you know i mean it was like dinner's over  uh that's fascinating all right so let's get to this thing you're going to jump off the top  are you and you're going to use a wingsuit we were hearing well i'm going to use a lot of different  equipment to get up and get down but the wingsuit is kind of you know the the main piece and i'll have  some accessories that will allow me to jump off the top and then land at the bottom those are  things i'm kind of keeping secret right now and you kind of have to watch the show for that but the 
[02:54:00]  main flight springs a few springs to push out a little further people giant ladder right as much  as people want to try to figure it out or speculate have you done a lot of wing uh suit jumps i've done  a lot uh well over a thousand now they look scary man it is it can be are you in some of those videos  where they come flying over your head oh yeah yeah you've done all that close to that stuff yeah  terrain flying how do you control that because some of those guys are it looks like they're barely 20  feet off the ground when they go flying over their body uh their buddy's head or something yeah i mean 
[02:54:30]  you can be a lot closer than that i've seen guys and been close you know within inches of stuff  rock formations and stuff like that but the the suit people don't realize how in control you actually  are i mean you're like superman in the suit you think i want to go over there and you go now  you can't just put the suit on and start doing that it takes years of training and jumping out  of aircraft and figuring it all out and it took me a long time and i i was i'm pretty on it kind 
[02:55:00]  of guy and it still took me years i still learn stuff every time i jump now so it's a it's a long  process if you want to do it safely and successfully without giving uh any info on what you're using  are you going to need something besides just running and jumping off the top of a mountain  because i would assume you're not going to be able to get away faster than you're going to fall  into some real estate right okay no that's true that's true okay you know the mountain is shaped  it doesn't have a perfectly vertical cliff right do a normal base jump off of so what i'm going to do 
[02:55:30]  i'll definitely have some accessories that'll allow okay well that's going to be interesting to see  and the air is thin that's going to affect some some help or hurt yeah well you know it's funny  everybody i thought that you would just kind of fall out of the sky you know you'd be swimming a  little bit but i did a test jump in 2010 out of an airplane and jumped from almost right at the summit  level right next to everest like i just flew right next to everest and i flew down and landed at the  base camp and all the equipment worked great there's some equipment i'll use that i haven't used that i 
[02:56:00]  couldn't test there but we tested it here in the united states so it's a cool system it all works  together and so the coolest science technology james bond style stuff how do you practice for  something like this it's like that jumping out of planes i guess it's a lot of jumping out of  planes right mostly yeah helicopters all that right you were amazed with this guy you know who i'm sure  you know he is what's his name elaine robert or oh the spider-man the french guy who climbs with no  no uh equipment whatsoever just a little bit of a resin or whatever rosin for his hands and i'm sure you 
[02:56:30]  you could do that if you can uh climb with no equipment on everest well i always like him  because he's one of my heroes he actually friended me on facebook a film not too long ago and uh i was  watching him on the news just the other day he's a cool guy i always wanted to be able to do something  you know he's one of the guys who's inspired me to do what i do now do you think you could do that  i i don't think i could do it a lot of what he's done if i train for a specific building then yeah i  could i could do that but i mean he's amazing and to do it without any safety i'd at least like to 
[02:57:00]  have a parachute on or something right yeah yeah just in case what have you done in the past that's  uh like holy shit well i mean i i had i've done a lot of different television projects and shows and  stuff and most of my specialty was learning how to do stuff really fast so i had a show at one point  where i had to learn how to do something in like a week so it might be like big wall mountain climbing  race car driving bull riding bull fighting things like that so uh extreme whitewater kayaking 
[02:57:30]  um you know having a background in climbing helps a lot you know uh or you know parachuting or skydiving  or base jumping wingsuit flying all that stuff it's it's all stuff you have to learn and it all happens  quickly so you can dig your thing i'm always amazed at these guys they you dig your fingers into this  little teeny crack in the rock and you don't fall yeah it's all about training  yeah you must have very strong hands i used to um you know i'm getting a little older now i'm not 
[02:58:00]  as fast or strong as i used to be that's why you're doing whatever yeah actually jumping off  would be easier than climbing down though right oh yeah i mean i'll be down in like 10 minutes my  camera crew those guys will be you know two or three more days oh man i'll probably be here back  in new york before bastards base camp yeah right oh that sucks for them yeah now getting the equipment  up there that's that seems like a lot of extra weight it's a lot of extra stuff going up there  this time you know between cameras and and extra suits and all the extra stuff that we have but um 
[02:58:30]  i've got a great sherpa team that's going to help me get all that stuff up there and how long is the  shoot up there i mean you got to figure what if you got to get this all done within an hour or two tops  we've got two hours for the live show and it starts i mean to shoot the whole thing i mean  you're not going to have a lot of yeah a lot of time to make sure you get everything right how you  do a live show with weather well it's just as pretty simple we just don't announce a certain date  until we know that we're getting really close right and you got to start climbing like three or four days 
[02:59:00]  ahead of when you want to get there so people will have a pretty good idea that's what it's going to  take you with the equipment and everything from base camp is about three days yeah probably three maybe  four days depending you know our weather reports are really really good so the weather tells you  kind of what's happening right a week out yeah how narrow like don't you guys sleep on fairly like uh  what's the like inclined areas when you're way up that high how inclined is something you'll have 
[02:59:30]  to sleep on or an area the there's several nice flat places and they have four camps and the first  uh i'd say three out of four are pretty you know on kind of like you know these big shelf kind  of areas but the third one camp three is actually on what they call the loatsy face which is this big  four thousand foot face it's ice and rock and and it's not a friendly place to be a fun place to be at  all yeah yeah how do you sleep there uh basically between me and my team we have to sort of you build 
[03:00:00]  a platform so if you've got a big incline you have to kind of chip that platform out so it's a lot of work  up there yeah you've seen the tents where they're right on the side of the mountain right oh yeah those things  are you've slept in those i've slept in those where you're completely vertical it's just a sheer  wall sam show uh jimmy if you how do you sleep like that what do you got to do to pee where you  walk i don't know how you hate that that's a good question i don't know how you get a good night's  sleep i can't sleep well in my bed i have sleep apnea can you plug in a machine up there 
[03:00:30]  you got to see these tents on the side of mountains it's unbelievable yeah i've uh  i've seen things it's just yeah pop one of those up portal edge oh that's how you sleep yeah yeah  i've done that you've actually done that that is nuts isn't it crazy it's all just hanging it's a  weird feeling to be up there like that yeah with nothing underneath you and then you wake up in the  morning and realize oh my god all right i'm here yeah because you probably have a dream like you're in 
[03:01:00]  bed or home and then you wake up like oh that's right i gotta look at all these tents set up where  do you go after you wake up how do you climb that how do you clean up everything to continue  climbing that's one thing about that particular type of climate especially is you have so much  equipment it's just like you have to have all that stuff amazing yeah yeah the last thing you  want to hear is you better hope that's a good strong tent bottom right last thing you want to  hear is rip you're also you're probably also in addition to having the tent attached to the wall 
[03:01:30]  you're probably attached to the wall as well right so if the tent rips you're okay yeah there's as you  can see from that photo there's lots of safety lines yeah so i don't know man you're sleeping on  the side of a rock it's not natural that's crazy we got a couple phone calls coming in for you let's  say hi to sean in new york city sean hello hi go ahead sean how's it going uh yeah i was just curious  about um the diet that you guys go through as like super athletes since you're climbing up a lot and a  plenty of mine and i we were uh discussing whether or not you eat fat food i just want to know how 
[03:02:00]  you felt about like wendy's i actually like wendy's um no the you know i try to i live in southern  california so it's pretty easy to eat healthy but there has to be a balance because on expeditions  especially you don't you're not always able to get your you know your wheat grass and stuff like  that so you got to be you got to be kind of flexible with that yeah we're probably not going to like  wendy's nuts to slap it off your chin i'm punching out what what do you need what do you look to eat 
[03:02:30]  if you're you're looking for the energy you need to to climb up a mountain like i'll have pretzels not  you and me that's a good question i i you know the the answer usually disappoints people but snickers  bars and coca-cola really that stuff actually works huh it does coca-cola is great i mean that's the  original energy drink and for how long does it last you when you tell you guys snickers and a coke how  how much will that give you for your crash a sugar crash well the thing about like high altitude 
[03:03:00]  climbing is that your body starts shutting down a little bit anyway so you don't you start to lose  your appetite your body's trying to survive it's not it won't your digestion and all that is everything  changes so you're not as hungry it doesn't take as much uh let me uh say hi to jim in ohio jim hey  hey how you doing good hey i got a question for your guest uh i watched this show one day when  them guys were doing that fly suit thing and they all went flying underneath this bridge  but one of the dudes hit the bridge and i'm just wondering if this is one of the guys that was 
[03:03:30]  if i was his friend or if he was with them i know the guy who hit the bridge i didn't know him  personally but i know the guy who was with him because he's my best friend wow or less yeah and  um yeah yeah some blood went on that guy it was his buddy man it's pretty bad yeah that was a rough  one uh for jeb i think because he survived it and his buddy died and um yeah that was a that was a  bad what happened i think they were flying under a bridge they were trying to go over a bridge and 
[03:04:00]  the guy actually they one guy cleared it and the other guy hit the bridge yeah it was a pretty bad scene  that was several years ago but you know it's the the the one good thing i would say about that is the  technology of the suits has gotten a lot better yeah then and like you know that guy he just timed  it a little bit wrong the new suits make it a safer he could have kind of popped up and gone away  if he had had one of those who knows but i mean anytime you're flying a man flying is not right yeah  yeah close to stuff is you know it just it's inherently very dangerous yeah speaking of that uh rob in 
[03:04:30]  mississippi go ahead hey fellas how you doing good bro uh a question i had for you it is a  perspective really i don't know how the freedom tower is but for example if all things were perfect  and you left off the freedom tower how many city blocks could you travel in this suit can you measure  it that way that's a cool idea i would love it if they'd let me do that they do they love it they  there's actually they just oh yeah they just got some guys in jail right about now yeah yeah those 
[03:05:00]  guys weren't weren't very smart about how they did that but you know you could fly a long way um  you know because once you once you fall like two or three hundred feet the suit starts going as fast  as you just about want it to go so you could hit 150 miles an hour in just a few seconds and you could  make it you know i mean you could fly all the way across central park kind of deal if you if you knew  what you were doing a long way yeah you stay up there for a long if a really big high performance  suit man you'd you'd everybody in new york would see you how great how do you get to work that way 
[03:05:30]  wait wait let's go so you you jump from the freedom tower how long before you would have you would hit  the ground the longest you could stay up how tall is the freedom times 1200 119 and 1100 feet or so  that's it 1776 oh that's the very top of the uh spire okay yeah i would say you could fly for  half a minute more before you'd even pull the parachute you know which sounds like a short  period of time but it's a long time if you're flying yeah if you're flying maybe more i mean i  know you can jump off a 2000 foot cliff like what we do in switzerland just for training 
[03:06:00]  and easily fly for close to a minute so you would jump off the birch tower i'm obsessed with that tower  in uh dubai you would do that in a second right oh yeah i was actually over in dubai hanging out with  some guys that um that work for the prince the crown prince because he he's a skydiver and he was in  love with skydiving so he built of course he built his own drop zone there yeah yeah why would you not  um and yeah i begged them to let me jump off that thing along with some other people too you know 
[03:06:30]  they all everybody wants to jump off tallest building in the world would be cool because  you could actually jump off of it you can do this in the freedom tower too you jump off instead of  just flying away you could just go circles around the building like superman now that would be cool  they did allow guys they put a crane out and these guys uh base jumped off it yeah um and they allowed  them to do that yeah that you know why because the crown prince gave him permission to do that that  was the crown prince's number two guy who i met and asked if i could do it now we're saving it for me  you know so yeah nasser good old nasser how weird is it though like to be a guy who looks at that 
[03:07:00]  building like i look at that building like oh it's so scary and you look at it and go like i'd love to  jump off that what a different mindset that is where does that come from yeah always uh always like  that even as a kid or were you doing the bicycles i think i was yeah i was definitely doing bicycles  off the ramps you know i was definitely when i was a little kid i wished that you know i can remember  thinking this i hope i live long enough that the technology is so good that we have a suit that  can allow you to fly yeah so there you go in the dream now yeah let me say hi to adam in canada 
[03:07:30]  a great question here adam hey man how's it going all right good just wondering you're going to be  jumping from 30 000 feet uh generally you've got to acclimatize to get up and down how are you going  to acclimatize because you're going to be what you said 10 minutes to get down well the key to  acclimatization is going slow and obviously coming down i'll go fast but the way that it works is you  have to acclimatize to go high but to go down the faster you go down the better you feel oh wow that's 
[03:08:00]  so it's kind of the opposite in that way yeah you got to get used to it on the way up each time  right now you hit another level and then on the way down it's just all good it's all good yeah  yeah didn't you used to have to go up and then back down a little bit is that still the case  yeah you know you don't just go up up up until you get to the top you go up you'll stay for a  little while at like one of the camps and then you come back down and you rest at base camp for a  little while then you go back up and you go a little higher the next time wow why uh because you  just can't let your body won't take it all at once your body just won't do it it's you got to do it 
[03:08:30]  over weeks and weeks it's a really long process that's part of everest of climb you know climbing  there is really hard because you have to basically be there for two months and who has two months to  be camping it takes that long oh yeah yeah yeah everybody who's trying to climb it or is there  right now i'll be a few days later but you know i'm leaving just a few days but they'll stay till the  end of the month of may most of them so you're leaving in a couple days and you're going to start  your two months to get to the top yeah yeah hopefully it'll be i i acclimatize a lot quicker than most 
[03:09:00]  people the guys i'm with are all big time professional guys even my camera guys have  summited you know more than one time so we should be ready to go sometime in the first part of may  and be ahead of most of those other guys who have something like 25 23 something like that yeah how  do you how do you climb like what kind of workouts do you do you you must have amazing cardio to be  able to do it uh yeah yeah um i do a lot of running a lot of long distance running you know run for  10 15 miles i do that you know two or three times a week and then i'm lucky right especially now right 
[03:09:30]  behind my house i got these big hills that i can run on hike all around so it's mostly that spend a  little time in the gym but it's a lot of running and how do they is there a test to know that you're  you're acclimatized there kind of is actually um a guy a really one of the greatest mountain climbers  in the world friend of mine from spain showed me this trick that that once you kind of feel like  i should be acclimatized you take your boots and socks off and you've sort of pressed down on the  bottom of your foot and if the blood takes a long time to to kind of to move back into it so like 
[03:10:00]  it should just so you push your make it into it and stay white and if it comes back that's how you  know your blood's really thick because it's moving around a little bit or you can do old  school russian way just cut your thumb open and see what comes out and if it's that real thick  dark blood then it's like yeah i've seen guys do that that is acclimatized that's not  acclimatized you're acclimatized so they they actually cut their thumbs to see i've seen  then you gotta climb with a sore thumb no problem i think the russians would do that right yeah of 
[03:10:30]  course okay it's not the problem don't worry what are your pussy  this has never been done before no one's ever parachuted off it uh no actually there's been uh  not many but i think a couple three or four different guys have paraglided off the summit it's  been a while yeah wow 80s and then some sherpa guys did a tandem like a couple years ago uh wow  this is a little bit different what we're doing but yeah you know it's still the idea of jumping off 
[03:11:00]  the top is is a pretty cool idea i'm not the only guy who wanted to do it that's for sure right you  see the felix uh what was his name felix bomb garden uh jump i did i saw it i wanted to do that too  actually that project he got it uh red bull got it but no that you know i would say i was happy for to  watch what felix did because in a lot of ways his project opened the doors for me to do my project  so you know that's not long after that i made my partnership with discovery and we got together 
[03:11:30]  and started working on it when you're falling because there's one point where he's falling i  mean he was at such a different altitude but he was spinning out of control and he could i guess he  put his arms up like almost a goal post to how do you stop yourself from spinning out of control  because he couldn't use that little parachute that the guys use right right no i watched him and he did this  you know he's trying to stabilize himself because you can't pull the parachute when you're spinning  out of control it's the same thing no matter what kind of flight you're doing you'll get tangled right  yeah i mean he was way up there so there was literally no resistance at all and i think he 
[03:12:00]  knew there would be you know as he came down you know there was more and more and more atmosphere to  kind of catch him a little bit but that's he did he just spread his arms and legs like a starfish they  call it and you just try to stabilize yourself like that does it work yeah if there's no air you just  it does work but i mean you know at super high altitudes i mean i expect to to drop a little  bit before i feel the suit bite into the air yeah a little bit but we'll see if he had because i  thought of that too like what if you panic at that height he jumped i think from 120 000 say you're at  98 000 or 106 000 you just have a panic attack and yank because you're falling so fast i think he broke 
[03:12:30]  the sound barrier if you pull the shoot at that speed would it rip you or would it really hurt you you  you know the one thing about any kind of flight especially you know like wingsuit stuff you have  to try to slow yourself down you don't want to pull the parachute at the last second um you know because  you could break your neck you're going really fast and so but yeah i think for felix he only probably  had a limited amount of oxygen in the suit anyway so he needed to make it down like if he pulled it 
[03:13:00]  that high he'd be up there for long oh yeah too long yeah way too long yeah so wow so this is going to  happen in may yeah sometime but we don't have an exact date yet right no it's all weather dependent  but you know they'll definitely we'll know like about a week out what day we're shooting for and  it'll definitely you know discovery channel let everybody know when we're going for it yeah they're  good you guys should hook up a little camera or something to you to watch all the way down  there's gonna be a camera should hook up uh we have one camera yeah you've heard of the gopros right
