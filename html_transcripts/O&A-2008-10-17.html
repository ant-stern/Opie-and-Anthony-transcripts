<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing his severe indigestion and heartburn, necessitating multiple trips to Rite Aid for various remedies, culminating in the expulsion of a "gray thing."  This led to a discussion of the significant stress he was experiencing due to wedding planning, exacerbated by complaints from family and friends. Listeners called in with their own humorous tales of wedding-related stress and family conflicts.  The conversation included tangents about Opie's upcoming marriage, a brother's self-surgery on a fishhook injury, and a caller who was punched by a relative at their wedding. The "F.U. line" segment aired, featuring angry messages from listeners.  The hosts also discussed Louis C.K.'s "Shoot Up" and *Life on Mars*, with a mention of Dr. Steve, a station doctor Opie consulted.

Next, the show shifted to Anthony's exorbitant utility bills: a $1,650 electricity bill and a $380 water bill (197,000 gallons over three months).  This sparked discussions about his lavish lifestyle, including a detailed description of his house, pool, jacuzzi, home theater, and oil tanks. The hosts and callers calculated the enormity of his consumption, comparing it to entire towns or golf courses. Anthony attributed the high electric bill to constantly running pool and jacuzzi equipment, numerous lights (including floodlights on his neighbors' properties), and multiple TVs.  The high water bill was suspected to stem from a leak in his new cabana.  A listener confessed to sleeping with Anthony's two best friends.  The conversation included humorous commentary on Anthony's carbon footprint, and callers shared their own stories of wasteful practices. The hosts discussed the Obama-McCain Al Smith Dinner, offering commentary and impressions of the candidates' jokes.  Colin Quinn was in studio, promoting his appearance at Caroline's Comedy Club and his book, "I Hate Your Guts."

A segment followed focused on a comedic critique of the Obama-McCain debate, dissecting their jokes. Obama's self-deprecating humor and McCain's surprisingly positive comments were analyzed. Anthony delivered several Ronald Reagan impressions, including a misremembered anecdote about the Challenger disaster and a "bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran" mic test gaffe.  A "Bomb Iran" novelty song was discussed.  The hosts debated the candidates' humor and the media's portrayal. A listener's confused interpretation of "When you assume, you make an ass out of you and me" led to a lengthy discussion. *Chocolate News* and *Life on Mars* were also mentioned, alongside comments about other comedians and celebrities. Jimmy Norton promoted his new book, "I Hate Your Guts," and the show ended with a *South Park* clip on breast cancer awareness and further rambling.


The next segment was a critical, highly offensive discussion of *Life on Mars*, featuring Jason Ritter (promoting *W* and *Good Dick*) and a caller ("CW from Scranton").  The hosts mocked the show's writing, anachronisms (especially the cars), and dialogue, repeatedly using the phrase "Wouldn't that be something?".  They extensively mocked a female character.  The discussion frequently veered off-topic, covering *The Office* (UK), Goldie Hawn, *CSI*, *Hill Street Blues*, *Goodfellas*, Madonna, and A-Rod. A caller's mishearing of a TV show title created a comedic moment.  A fictitious character, Patty, was used for comedic effect. A lengthy, explicit discussion about pornography ensued, with detailed personal anecdotes from Opie and Anthony.  The segment ended with a humorous interaction with the fictional Patty and Jason Ritter.

The final segment featured Jason Ritter, beginning with sexually suggestive banter and a crude joke about "Two Girls, One Cup."  The conversation shifted to Ritter's career, including his roles in *W*, unsuccessful auditions, and anecdotes about Colin Quinn's past relationship with Larry the Cable Guy and his confrontational personality.  Quinn's interactions with celebrities, including an embarrassing anecdote with Rich Voss and Chaz Palminteri, were discussed at length. Ritter's own experiences in the entertainment industry, including missed opportunities and working with difficult people, were also covered.  The segment concluded with plugs for Ritter's movie, Quinn's appearances, and a sponsor.  The entire segment was filled with profanity, crude humor, and sexually explicit references.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  And then go, oh, that's sad and really meaningless.  Yes, you said my grandma fell down the steps and she got up and nothing was broken.  Hey, the power of Christ compels you.  Huh?  The power of dice compels you.  The power of dice compels you.  I'm going to say you must have a magical penis because this is just unbelievable that somebody would go to this extent after a breakup.  I am such a...  Whoa, I hit the dumb button on myself on that one. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, Friday.  How'd that happen?  It just happens.  Wasn't it just Monday, like four days ago?  Yeah, I think so.  I think that's how it works.  I'm going to be burping and farting all day, so don't mind me.  Oh, so it's any other day?  I hold back on the farts.  Do you?  I was going to say you hold back on the burps. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's noticeable.  Is there a gaseous tug of war going on in your stomach?  There sure is.  Doesn't know which way to go.  There's some nugget of filth that is dying to leave via gas.  It doesn't know what holds for me.  It doesn't know which way to go.  Welcome to my life.  Well, now that you brought it up, I just got to say really fast that I spent the whole night watching the Islanders win,  watching McCain and Obama make jokes at each other, watching the big Red Sox come back, 
[00:02:00]  and looking up symptoms for a heart attack.  So it was a wonderful night for me.  Sounds fun.  Yeah.  Well, you got the indigestion, the heartburn.  The worst heartburn I've ever had in my life.  The worst.  And I called up our good friend there, a doctor who's a fine friend of the radio show.  He does his own little radio show on our station.  Yeah, Dr. Steve.  Every so often.  Hello.  Yes, I'm Dr. Steve. 
[00:02:30]  Not that, Steve.  Hello.  Yes.  You need a suppository.  I'll be right over.  Yeah.  Imagine.  Oops.  I forgot the suppository, but we could work around that.  Yes.  Sometimes a wiffle bat works well.  So I called Dr. Steve.  I'm like, I got this massive heartburn where it feels like a huge burp that I just can't burp up.  Just feels like air and gas.  And then all of a sudden he's like, are you nauseous? 
[00:03:00]  Are you sweating a lot?  Do you have pain in your shoulder?  Do you have pain in your jaw?  I'm like, those are symptoms for a heart attack.  He goes, well, I just want to rule it out.  You want to rule that out quickly.  I'm like, well, thanks.  Thanks for ruling that out.  And then when I told him, well, I'm also, can you say the F word for the thing?  I don't want him to dump out.  The F word.  I would say the F word's probably not that F word.  But can you say fart?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I think they've dumped out in the past.  And I told him, well, I'm doing that pretty much every 30 seconds. 
[00:03:30]  He goes, okay, that's good news because that's not a symptom of a heart attack.  I'm like, great.  All right.  So we've established it's not a heart attack, but I'm still dying over here.  What do I do?  You're like a pulse rocket on a buzz bomb.  Yeah.  You can say fart.  You just can't be doing it on people.  You can't elaborate on it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, it's a medical thing.  So then he had me marching up and back and forth to Rite Aid like three different times  to try to figure out what's going to make this work and then to get rid of it. 
[00:04:00]  And then he starts explaining that what you got going on is this like foam, the indigestion,  the heartburn, the gassy stomach.  It's like this foam and you got to attack that foam with some, you know, Milac, my,  my, whatever, my, my, what is it?  What?  My, not Mydol.  Mydol.  I need that.  I need that on some warning.  Did you have Prilosec? 
[00:04:30]  Well, I had that.  My.  The stuff you drink with the M.  Milanta.  Milanta.  Sure.  So you get the Milanta in there and that'll knock down the foam and you'll start feeling  better.  But that wasn't working.  And then he goes, oh, bad news for you.  It's past the stomach and now you're just going to have to ride this out.  And that's what I did for the last eight to 10 hours.  I wrote it out.  You know what you got to do?  You do a shot of a peppermint schnapps in a headstand.  Could you think of anything that would be more painful in that situation than a shot 
[00:05:00]  of schnapps in a headstand?  Oh my God.  Just the thought.  Ow.  Just the thought.  And then he was talking about something like a, I hear every other word when a doctor  talks.  So something about a spastic colon.  So basically my colon was doing this, squeezing, letting go, squeezing, letting go.  You're getting like muscle twitches in your colon.  So then I had to march up to, you know, Rite Aid for another drug to take care of that.  I was farting and marching.  Farting, marching, burping, bloated. 
[00:05:30]  Just marching.  The world's most unpleasant soldier.  I was, I had a big bloated gut.  I was scared Madonna was going to try to adopt me.  That sounds to me like you, that, those are like not heart attack symptoms.  That would, that would just sound to me like there's a real bad acid reflux or something  like that.  Like that's a, yeah, it was horrendous.  And I think you, you know, you're a little bit, uh, you know, anxious about future events. 
[00:06:00]  Well, I, well, it's no secret.  I'm getting married.  What?  Sooner than later.  But, uh, I guess that, I guess it's related to that.  And then two more hives popped up and I'm just like, God.  Hives are a classic symptom of nerves.  Well, it's it.  Or AIDS.  No.  Because I did look that up.  I'm like, oh, hives.  Let's, uh, cross reference.  See what it could be.  I want to give you a spastic colon.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, no, it's, it's, it's, you're allergic to something, but then the nerves and the 
[00:06:30]  stress will bring on the hives.  My friend.  Yeah.  I've been studying all this crap for way too long.  And so then I marched up to Rite Aid in my pajamas again to get another like pill.  Not in your PJs.  Yeah.  And then I slept like three hours.  And this morning I gave birth to something.  Oh no.  Oh wow.  So I think it finally passed whatever it was causing this.  It was, uh, it was gray. 
[00:07:00]  Ooh.  Like a light chalky gray.  Oh.  Where I had.  Leave it on the steps of a police station or a firehouse.  Totally.  Where I had to look at it.  Really?  I had to study it because I was amazed by, uh, what this was.  And don't call with what you think I have now because I had a gray thing happen.  Because I've been completely normal up until the day before and, and, uh.  Gray thing.  And I'm sure when I march into that bathroom within moments, it'll, it'll be a, it'll be 
[00:07:30]  a normal again.  So it was a rough night.  Ooh.  A real rough night.  And it's, it's, you know, it goes, it's distressed because you're getting  married.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm, I'm so into getting married.  I'm, I'm, I, this, I know this is the thing, you know, I, I, I'm into that.  They allow it in Connecticut now.  But what I think is bothering me is, uh, is the planning is everyone's issues and problems. 
[00:08:00]  Every day it's a problem.  Everyone gets their hands involved in it.  Every day it's a problem.  It has nothing to do with me and my girl.  Like we're ready.  We should have, I swear to God, we both said it the other day.  We should have just take, taken our money, went to an Island, invite a few people and  just got married like that.  Yeah.  To wait nine months to a year to get married.  It's just one problem after another.  Gives people more time to get the, get involved.  Yeah.  Just dumb things.  You know, they ran out of, uh, you know, double beds in the room at the hotel. 
[00:08:30]  You know, uh, I have an uncle that called me and I got to call him out on this.  He's mad because I'm getting married on, on my uncle's birthday.  Who knows their uncle's birthdays?  So that was a thing for a few days.  Do you know your uncle's birthday?  Really?  No.  Do you know your uncle's birthday?  Not even my uncle, Sam.  Right.  So.  July 4th.  Oh, really?  Oh, uncle Sam.  Jesus.  Hello.  July 4th.  Hello.  Canadian.  Oh no, it's his wife's Canadian.  Yeah.  I was in the car.  Yeah.  And, uh, sort of makes me Canadian. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, that's a real obscure.  Yeah.  So, so he's mad because I'm getting married on my uncle's birthday.  Who's no longer with us.  I'm like, do you understand when, when you decide to get married and you start looking  at places, they give you like three dates in the coming year.  You don't have a lot of choices.  No.  So I'm like, all right, this month seems like the month we want to do it.  So yeah, I'll take that date.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't think you had to call up all your relatives to make sure  it wasn't an important date for somebody else.  I don't celebrate dead people's birthdays anyway. 
[00:09:30]  I don't acknowledge them.  Who does that?  You're lucky if I remember your birthday when I'm alive.  Right.  Mom and dad and Tracy and my nephew.  Those are hard enough for me to remember.  Anyone in the family that's dead, I remember nothing.  Unbelievable.  And then it's just one thing after another.  We have someone helping us with the wedding and those meetings are two to three hours.  I'm like two to three, that's half, that's half the reception right there.  And that's on a weekly basis.  It's like a full-time job.  I want to know how, um, how Lindsay handles these evenings with you. 
[00:10:00]  She wrote it out, not me.  Where you're just like, yeah.  She wrote it out.  You think she ever stands there and goes, hmm.  Hmm.  Nothing more.  Just kind of a, hmm.  There you are.  Oh, I got to go in my PJs.  I'll be right back.  Oh my God, yeah.  And she goes to the doctor.  I have this itch.  It's right, it's the finger next to my pinky.  I'm just scratching it on the left hand.  Yeah, because someone said, uh, dude, you didn't write it out.  Your girl wrote it out. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's the guy's on it.  Of course.  Yeah.  I'm saying stuff like, don't touch me.  I was just miserable last night.  Oh, no.  Just miserable.  Oh.  And then.  Imagine what the bottom side of that comforter smells like.  Oh, please.  And, uh, you know, I live, uh, Jimmy and I live very close to each other.  You know the hill?  I was just propelling up that hill with, with farts.  No problem.  What time?  Oh my God.  What time?  I went there at six.  I went there at eight and I went there at nine 30.  I went there three different times to get three different, uh, things to try to calm this, 
[00:11:00]  uh, whole gut down.  Right.  Yeah.  So maybe he's eight sitting bad.  Is that possible?  I mean, if you, if you, if you're dropping gray logs all over the, all over the place.  I think honestly, I, I, I'm allergic to something.  I can't figure it out.  I can't figure it out.  Cause I'm, I'm having these, uh, these issues.  So I say pure nerves, just nerves would, would do this.  It's, it's, it's just the, how recently they've popped up and been more so than usual.  Well, that's just, yeah, you're just waiting and we have a lot of family and friends that 
[00:11:30]  listen to this radio show.  Stop calling me with your problem.  You got to do.  It's not about you.  It's not about you.  I think I'm on the air.  That way they all get it.  Get the message at one time.  I'm serious.  Stop.  Leave me alone.  I'm serious.  It's a mass email.  Basically.  Yeah.  You just got to give the message to everybody.  Spread the word.  It's not about you.  It's about us.  Unless it's new year's.  Holy crap.  You're not getting married.  We are. 
[00:12:00]  That's what you got to say.  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding every night.  Well, this person has a problem with this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, I don't want to go.  It's not about you.  And I care if you have a problem.  And I think the reason I'm bringing it up, cause I think a lot of people could relate  to this, you know, you, you, you, you want to do the right thing and get married  and, and do it, you know, a nice big affair and, uh, and wow, it's, it's way too many  problems.  It's not, it's not their marriage.  Well, you know what I mean?  It's all, it's, it's not worth it. 
[00:12:30]  I would suggest to people out there, just go, just go do something cool and get married.  It's not worth it.  It really isn't.  People calling every night.  Oh, blah, blah, blah.  And then people that, did you do this yet?  Blah, blah, blah.  Why haven't you done this?  I don't understand.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Shut up.  We'll get everything done.  Shut up.  People are just annoying.  Yeah.  Cause everybody thinks they're the only ones calling.  Right.  I think I'm the only one that has an issue.  Right.  They'll focus.  And it's just right.  We've had people calling, well, the, uh, the hotel you, you picked, it's really expensive. 
[00:13:00]  Well, guess what?  There's other hotels that you could choose from to stay.  So go figure it out.  Yes.  How many choice was for my rich friends?  How many, how many weddings have we all been to?  You just, you just go and you figure it out.  I've been to, you don't call the people and go, wow, I can't afford this hotel.  We've had people go, are you going to pay for the hotels?  No, we're not paying for that.  Who pays for the hotel rooms?  Does everyone go to the wedding?  I don't care.  The people have to be told everything to do. 
[00:13:30]  It's ridiculous.  When it comes to a wedding.  Ridiculous.  It's like you go there, show up, get your hotel room, whatever it takes to be at an  event.  It's ridiculous.  I hope you said on many occasions, if you can't afford bread, let them eat cake at the  Motel 6.  But that is irritating.  There's a four hotel choice.  It's like, it's one night.  It's not like you go in there like, look, we need you to get first class tickets and  spend a week in a Ritz Carlton in Hawaii.  It's like, there's four hotels you can stay at. 
[00:14:00]  We chose four hotels and in all different price ranges.  And they're all good hotels close to where we're getting married.  So it's like, just pick a cheaper hotel.  What do you want from me?  And then someone calls up and goes, well, they ran out of double beds.  What am I supposed to do about that?  Oops.  Because those are the people, I guess, that are sharing a room.  I'm like, well, get a effing air mattress.  Start with one from me.  Huh?  Or start banging.  Yeah.  Whoever the people are, bang away.  Get in that bed together.  It's unbelievable.  You know, the marrying part, that's the easy part. 
[00:14:30]  It's dealing with everyone's problems and the planning.  Just shut up.  It's not about you.  And it's in a major city, too.  So, yeah, hotels are going to be more expensive.  It's the way it is.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm going to Boston or I go somewhere else, the hotels.  Look at the prices.  I'm like, ugh.  Right.  Jesus.  That's annoying.  It is what it is.  Let's go to Aaron in North Carolina.  Aaron.  Aaron.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Irby's dead on.  I just got married two weeks ago, and I had to take help from my mom because I didn't 
[00:15:00]  name my brother my best man.  Instead, I named my best friend.  And it was just a pain in the ass.  Yeah, this is worth talking about for a few minutes.  This is what goes on.  The guy wanted someone to be his best man, and then the mom gets involved and goes, why  didn't you ask your brother?  It's not about you, mom.  Because it's my wedding.  Right.  You don't hang out with me.  You don't understand how I work.  Who is your best man?  My brother.  Which brother?  Yeah, which was my first and only choice.  Which brother?  Very happy.  Scott.  Okay.  Scott, who has the fish hook in his thumb, if people have seen the picture on Opie's. 
[00:15:30]  Have you seen this picture yet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's on Opie's eye.  He was fishing with his son, and he put a hook through the bottom of his thumb, and  it came out the top.  And did his own surgery, because he's like Joe the Plumber.  He doesn't have that great health insurance.  And this is what people do if they don't have the health insurance.  So he's like, well, what I had to do was I had to push the hook all the way through,  because you know the tip of the hook has that barb.  That barb?  Thanks, Ant.  And so he had to, look, right there, Jimmy.  He had to push it all the way through, and then snip it, and then pull it all the way 
[00:16:00]  back out.  Ow.  My brother's a real man.  He's ridiculous.  When you've got brothers, and you've got to pick a best man.  Like, Ant's got one brother.  Right.  You know, if you decide to go family, you go with Joe.  But is it awkward with brothers?  When I had to pick someone from my confirmation when I was seventh grade or sixth grade, I  had so many uncles I had to ask.  I didn't know who to ask.  Right.  You know, it was this one, that one, this one.  I started thinking, I just went with the, I don't even know how I picked. 
[00:16:30]  It was random.  The one that hadn't touched you?  No.  Or the one.  No, I think I actually went with the uncle with the coolest car.  Oh, there you see.  That's how kids are.  But you're a kid.  That's, you know, that's the decision you made.  Makes perfect sense.  At least you had some kind of criteria.  Right.  What do you pick?  I mean, you love all your brothers.  So who do you pick as a brother?  Well, my brother Scott and I are pretty much like Irish twins.  We're barely a year apart.  And it was always me, Scott, and brother Elmo.  On MySpace, by the way.  He's always looking for new friends.  It was always us three, but I think me and Scott were a bit closer. 
[00:17:00]  That's all.  I mean, you know, no one's upset, that's for sure.  They kind of expected it.  They're probably relieved, too, because you don't have the best man duties.  That is a, yeah, real pain in the ass.  Is he responsible?  I mean, you know, it's nice and everything, especially when it's family and stuff.  But when someone asks you, hey, could you be my best man?  You're just kind of like, oh, Christ, I really, oh, this is a lot of work.  Yeah.  Oh, this is a lot of work.  Yeah, but in our case, you know, they go, oh, my God, and then call you and tell you all the oh, my God's. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  If you don't want to do it, then, you know, turn in your tux.  Turn in your tux, sir.  You know, just shut the F up.  Yeah, so I picked my brother.  I think he's also the only one that wasn't a best man in my family.  I'm from a large family, and I think he was the only one that wasn't, you know, called up to the big.  Never got to be one.  Yeah, so it's perfect, and I'm very happy about that.  I did it for Voss, but it was easy because I realized I had to go to Canada, basically.  It wasn't like I had a whole tremendous, I didn't plan a bachelor party and all that stuff. 
[00:18:00]  So when Voss said he was getting married in Canada, did you call him up or Bonnie and go, wow, where am I going to stay?  And blah, blah, blah.  God, how am I going to get there?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, but I wanted to set the whole country on fire because that's when I just went out to L.A. to do Lucky Louie,  and my stuff was in storage for two weeks because I had moved into a roach infested apartment.  Yeah.  That was an abomination, and I flew into Minneapolis.  I was a nightmare, and they got married in a hunting lodge, and everyone just felt bad for Bonnie because of Voss. 
[00:18:30]  I guarantee that my whole—  When she left with Voss, did they think they stole—he stole—she's—  It's still going to be funny.  You got it.  No, it's there.  No, I'll bail.  No, you're there, Ed.  I'll bail.  You're there.  Come on.  You're too early in the setup to have—  You're there.  It's he or she stole.  You're fishtailing.  You're there.  You're not crashing yet, my friend.  When they left the hunting lodge, did they think that Bonnie stole—  And you know what the animal would be?  The stuffed animal would be—  I'm not even going to—  What was it? 
[00:19:00]  Some head off a—I imagine it was a dump.  What's a dump?  It was going to be a beaver joke.  I'll just leave it at that.  It was going to be a fantastic beaver joke.  In my head, it was worded so eloquently.  And I went, dar, dar, dar.  They think that he or she took a mortgage of the artist.  He, dar, something about a dress.  God damn.  Wow.  Did I flop all over that one?  That's hilarious.  But I still knew, as soon as you tripped over it, it was still, all right, there's a dumb  animal joke in there somewhere. 
[00:19:30]  Of course.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Pennsylvania.  Jeff?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, man.  Hey, yeah, I'm actually getting married in less than a month.  November 15th, I'm getting married.  And I'm telling you, gentlemen, it's been just pure unadulterated heck from the start  of it.  Yeah.  We wanted to go to—yeah, we wanted to go to Vegas and get married.  Her parents were going to pay for the whole deal.  That wasn't good enough for my mom.  She brings me to her house and sits me down without my fiancée and goes, oh, yeah, we  can't have this. 
[00:20:00]  I'm like, are you serious?  You haven't put a dime into this wedding, and now you're telling me that, you know, you're  telling me where I have to have my wedding.  I'm like, so now I've got this big, lavish, you know, 200-person wedding coming out.  And then I actually went to the doctor yesterday.  I have a hernia that I need to get surgically repaired on Monday.  You think it's related to what's going on with the stress?  Probably.  Probably squeeze it too hard in the morning, if you know what I mean.  I'm telling you, there's been some intestinal blockages, and it hasn't been for me. 
[00:20:30]  People have been up my butt the whole time about this.  Look, you know what?  I really wish we did this break about six to eight months ago.  I really wish.  Because some people said, wow, you know, you don't know what you're in for.  This is a big thing.  And they're not talking about actually getting married, the planning.  And I swear to God, I would encourage people to really think about it before they go down  this road, the big wedding thing, because everybody gets involved.  I mean everybody.  Say what you just said, though.  It's not about you.  Early on.  The whole, it's not about, it's not about you. 
[00:21:00]  I'm trying to keep, I don't want to get too specific, but I'll throw this one out there  too.  My mom has actually called me more than six times, maybe close to ten times, wondering  if she's invited to my wedding.  So I got to deal with that crap.  You got to give the invitation.  Because she's got her own issues.  So she's like, am I even going to be invited to your wedding because I don't return her phone  call or something, I'm like, are you effing kidding me? 
[00:21:30]  Let's say hi to Rob in Boston.  Rob.  Hey, morning, guys.  Go Sox, go.  I told you.  I told you yesterday.  Oh, you did.  I couldn't believe it.  Amazing comeback for the Red Sox.  Wow.  What do you got, Rob?  Jimmy, can't wait to see you next month in Boston, man.  Got tickets to your show.  Wilbur's Theater, still tickets available for the third show.  Yeah, it's a tough time to be on sale, the economy.  Poor people.  You got two that sold out like that, though, Jimmy.  I'll see you there, buddy.  Thank you.  Hey, I'm promoting it at work, though, believe me.  You're a good boy. 
[00:22:00]  But, yeah, look, I was at Buffalo for a wedding, and my friend and his bride were just catching  it, just getting taunted by the bride's mother the whole time.  She, first of all, booze bag, and she was like, you shouldn't be doing this.  I don't support it.  I'm not even going to be at the hotel the next day to help you get dressed.  Whatever.  And then she showed up at the wedding like everything's all, you know, fine.  She's been doing this for the last, like, year and a half, since they got engaged.  It was unbelievable. 
[00:22:30]  And the groom's father, the groom's parents paid for the whole wedding.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  You know what, man?  People are selfish.  And just because people are family or close friends doesn't mean that they're not selfish.  And it's like, at a wedding, which is a major event, a lot of people's selfishness or personal  obsessions are going to come out.  And it's got to be really irritating.  Yeah.  It's like trannies.  We'll just take a couple more, then we'll move on with the show.  I love this stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  Because I don't have to worry about it right now, so it's kind of fun to watch somebody 
[00:23:00]  else.  Oh, God, that sucks.  I'll tell you this, just having this, like, 20 minutes to just rant about it, I guarantee  these hives are now gone.  Because it's like, we're lucky we have a radio show so we can get it out there.  But I've been holding this in for so long, and obviously it's affected me physically.  I have to just rant and rave for a minute.  Steve in Jersey, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I'm getting married in two weeks, and I'm about ready to kill everybody in both my family  and my in-laws from telling me that the intro, I'm going to have Hell's Bells as my intro 
[00:23:30]  music as we walk into the reception.  Yeah.  Them telling me it sounds like funeral music, you've got to change it.  Yeah.  I provided two limo buttons to get people back from the hotel to the reception, and they're  saying, what if there's not enough room?  I rent an effing can.  I took care of as much as I could.  Yeah.  It just makes you want to kill everybody.  It gets insane.  I think for a second, and just think for a second and do it for yourself, because if 
[00:24:00]  something isn't set up, don't call the people that are trying to get married.  I actually had someone call and go, the girls aren't going to be wearing black dresses,  are they?  Because I don't like black.  I don't like black dresses.  I'm like, it's not about what you like.  Yeah.  You idiot.  And yes, you're invited.  Oh, Jesus.  I've got to get my tux.  I keep forgetting. 
[00:24:30]  This is a good, this is like a real event.  Oh, I'm buying tuxes for people, too.  Trust me.  Oh, are you good?  Because I have a...  Well, I'll actually buy one.  I'll add you to the list, because you know, I blah, blah can't blah, blah, blah.  If you think you can, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  I'm doing this for other people that are getting married, and they're having the same crap happen  to them, and hopefully maybe they're listeners of this show.  Leave them alone.  I had a great engagement. 
[00:25:00]  It was picture perfect.  I should have had a priest right on the beach, and boom.  Do it right there.  Because we're in the moment.  It was just a real moment.  No one was thinking about me, me, me, me.  It was all about me and my girl.  It was perfect.  And I should have thought further about it and did it right there.  Yep.  Right there.  Let's say hi to Paul in Seattle.  Everyone would have been mad about not having a girl.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:25:30]  What's going on, guys?  How are you, Paul?  All right.  Jimmy, I just watched you on Red Eye two hours ago.  You look well, not in a gay way, but you actually look – I mean, I saw you years ago, but I don't know if that came out right.  Thank you very much.  I think we – it came out right.  Thank you, man.  We don't always have to be homophobic on the show.  I think we know what you were talking about.  I was opening my shirt a little farther each time.  I was showing a lot of chest.  Yeah, thank you, sir.  I'm glad you noticed.  Jimmy looks very good on TV.  Thank you.  Notice I said on TV.  Sorry, Jimmy. 
[00:26:00]  But I see you in the morning when you're not showering or shaving or anything.  Five minutes after my hemorrhoid applicator.  Right.  You got problems?  Really?  Oh, my God.  Civil rights footage in my bathroom.  Paul in Seattle.  So, yeah, so I actually had to plan some hotel stays for an English couple who were flying about 10 English couples over to Vegas for a wedding.  And just because I was the only American, I kind of took care of everything for them.  And so I got the front of all the complaints. 
[00:26:30]  And it was just ridiculous between how many times people are complaining because they weren't in the same tower as the groom's mother.  That was a big problem.  It's a five-minute walk to the other tower.  I don't really get it.  And the other one I loved was, you know, the whole incidental thing, you know.  I got to the counter, and there was a bit of a problem with the incidentals.  I didn't know what to do with my credit card.  It's like they're retarded.  Like, they'd never traveled before.  I'm like, look, you're getting a free room.  You just got to give them a credit card in case you're at the minibar. 
[00:27:00]  But it was just constant abuse.  And they were calling me at all hours of the day as well because they just didn't know what time zone I was on.  So I was getting calls like 3 in the morning going, what's the address again of the hotel?  I'm like, do you know what the Internet is?  Like, honestly?  Yeah.  It's not about – the theme here is it's not about you.  It's not about you.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  The goddamn Red Sox won that game?  Yes.  Where have you been, Jimmy?  Can you believe they won that game?  They were down 7-1.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, I thought someone got murdered. 
[00:27:30]  Jimmy's looking at the TV with his mouth agape.  Yep.  Dude, it was 7-0.  Nothing.  Yeah.  And Fenway fans were leaving, and I stopped watching.  Yeah, of course.  The game was over.  I was watching Iron Man.  Yeah.  I thought you were joking.  Like, I picked Boston, and they lost.  And I'll be honest.  I was sitting here making believe I made it to the end.  I gave up, too.  And then this morning, I was checking sports.  I'm like, what?  Holy Christ.  What?  They pulled that off.  Wow.  Well, I'm on my way to Florida right now, and I was hoping to get to go see game one.  Because I grew up in Philly.  It was a complete meltdown of pitching. 
[00:28:00]  Dude, what was –  It was –  It was a complete meltdown of pitching.  They were six outs away.  They looked like the Mets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have just –  Red Sox are going to now win this series.  I can't believe –  They're going to now win this series.  They won that game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did they start their comeback?  Monumental.  The second you turned the –  As soon as you went quick.  It really was.  All right.  He turned the set off.  Yeah.  Jimmy's not watching anymore.  Bring on the action.  Boston was getting killed.  7-0.  I was thinking to myself, whoever left, imagine if they came back, because you always think that. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  But those dumb fans that left have got to be –  Stupid Sully and whatever else their names are up there.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Let's throw one more call at this, and then we'll move on.  Mike in Jersey.  How are you, Mike?  What's up, boys?  How are you?  Good.  All right.  Let's see.  I got married at 23.  Had a big old wedding.  Paid for everything myself.  Jesus.  Hold everybody.  Get stupid.  Your reservations done in advance.  This, four days before the wedding, the matriarch of the family, this old grand aunt, calls 
[00:29:00]  up my mother, says, I demand that my daughter and her two four- and six-year-old kids come.  And we said, no kids.  No kids at all.  So we told them no.  So after the wedding, we're all happy, and you're standing at the front of the church  where everybody greets you.  This old bag walks up, punches me in the freaking mouth in front of everybody.  80-year-old woman belts me right in the mouth and calls me a –  She said, I know you knew those beaches should have been closed, and my son's dead.  My son's dead, and I want you to know that. 
[00:29:30]  A Kittner boy joke.  There's nothing –  Wow.  I don't care how old Jaws is.  It's always two weeks old and appropriate.  Yes.  It's still in theaters as far as we're concerned.  Yes.  So you got punched by your great aunt on your wedding day.  That's good.  If that's not a me, me, me thing, it's a me, me, me thing happening.  Dude, this is how stupid people are.  One time I was at a wedding, and I had to give – I wanted to make sure that my gift  was the biggest.  So I got the Don alone, and I'm trying to express my loyalty to him. 
[00:30:00]  And a bunch of little kids run in.  Oh, you hate when that happens.  Yeah.  And you stumble over your words.  The day of your daughter's – I didn't know what to say.  I'm reading the paper.  I don't want to do the traditional bachelor party.  Guess what?  It was told to me by many.  It's not about you.  It's for all the married guys and stuff, so you really should just do the traditional  bachelor party.  It's pretty much legal cheating.  Right.  You know.  Get in there.  So I'm having a bachelor party that I don't want anything to do with either, so. 
[00:30:30]  Bachelor parties, to me, I would really – I think what Voss did is we all went out  to eat.  I would rather go out to –  I want to do something mellow.  Good steak dinner.  Yeah, we could go to the boobie bar, but I don't want to be the idiot on the stage  with his shirt off, with his man boobs hanging out as they humiliate me.  You don't have to go to that extent.  They all do it, though.  They all say, oh, we won't do that.  And then you end up there.  They're shoving Jack Daniels down your throat in front of –  Some of the girls you see can get you psyched for the steak, though. 
[00:31:00]  Well, have one that looks just like that.  Not as well done, though, of course.  Rarer.  You know what would have been perfect?  That joint in Dallas that you and I went to, Jimmy, back in the day?  Steak and broads, Ant.  The best steak – the best steak in Dallas.  Steak and lobster in the strip club.  It was like an old –  Oh, really?  It was set up like a –  It's called The Lodge.  Okay, I was going to say it was set up like an old lodge, and it's called The Lodge.  Hot chicks.  And the food was ridiculous.  The chicks were hot.  Wow.  The food was great. 
[00:31:30]  I was like, I'm not eating –  The wine was amazing.  Lobster.  And they're like, you know, this is like a legitimate real restaurant in a strip club.  And like you sit down and you eat a real meal.  And it was like – the girls were like away.  It wasn't gross because they were like a little bit away from you while you were eating a real meal.  Yeah.  And then you were eating a lap dance.  You don't want to like up on the bar or the stage while you're eating.  Yeah.  You're trying to get a dollar.  It looks like an elephant's trunk is reaching down and scooping up your snow piece.  I would grab a lobster claw and clip off one of our –  That was the same trip that one of my brothers had strep throat and decided to give it to one of the strippers. 
[00:32:00]  What was one of your brothers?  I don't remember.  It was – yeah, there was a bunch of them actually.  And one of them had strep and decided he wanted to pass it along to one of the strippers.  That's a goof.  877-212-018.  Finally hitting the break.  Sorry if I – I don't know.  I had to just get that off my chest as I itched the hive that's growing on the back of my head.  Leave us alone. 
[00:32:30]  It's not about you.  That's the theme.  Mass email.  Opie and Anthony.  So, yeah, Greg, centerpieces.  Look, we want everybody to be able to take one home.  Could you put 15 centerpieces on each table?  Thanks.  Get back to me on that one.  Are you bugging my house?  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:33:00]  877-212-0&A.  Yeah, the Red Sox.  Just an amazing comeback.  Yeah.  I thought you were being started.  I'm like, ah, you picked the Red Sox and they got blown out 7-0.  And then I saw it on TV.  I'm like, those son of a bitch.  I can't believe they won again.  Yeah, the Rays, the pitching just completely fell apart.  Who wants to see the Rays in the World Series?  No one.  Wait a minute.  What game was that?  What?  Baseball.  No, no, no.  Oh.  No, is that, they still have more games to play? 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I thought that meant Red Sox was going to the series.  No, no.  No, they were down like 3-1.  Red Sox still got to win two, Jimmy.  It's three games in two.  Not that it hasn't been done before, even under worse circumstances.  As we all remember.  Go Sox, go.  I got to, I got to, I'm yawning today and stuff.  Funny.  I got to, I got to blame.  What's wrong?  I'm blaming Louis C.K. for me being tired today.  Really?  Because I go to bed and I figure, ah, I'll just go to sleep. 
[00:34:00]  I'll pop something on.  And I put on Showtime and Louis special.  What was it called?  Shoot Up?  Shoot Up is the newest one.  Shoot Up.  Dude, so goddamn funny.  I, I'm just laying there laughing like a retard.  Just laying in bed laughing.  The guy is too goddamn funny and he doesn't, he doesn't give a crap what he says.  It's amazing.  He's dropping the N-bomb.  He's, uh, just the, and, and always, you know, the way he talks about his kids and stuff. 
[00:34:30]  It's just, he is despicable and hysterically funny.  Didn't he shoot that, I think what Louis did was shot that in, uh, Boston.  I think at that legendary, it was a legendary hall he shot that in.  And he's smart because the acoustics he got the way he wanted.  Yeah.  The audience was dark.  Like a lot of times they want to light.  It was.  You couldn't see the audience once and I loved it.  I hate that fake, like, laugh thing they do sometimes where they just edit in where, you know, maybe there was a good laugh somewhere and they pop in some, some douche you don't want to see going, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:35:00]  They do that for editing purposes.  I know.  I know.  So they could switch back and forth.  And, and there was a couple of points where I was like, and, and Louis edited it because I watched the credits in the end.  It said edited by, you know, Louis C.K.  I was like, there's a couple of instances where the edit looked a little weird, like, cause they didn't cut to something else and then go back to him.  But it didn't matter.  It wasn't like distracting.  His material is so funny that I didn't care about that.  But I don't want to, you know, go to someone's face or something. 
[00:35:30]  I, I'm never a big fan of that.  I never would have thought of that because Louis is a smart, he's a director.  I mean, Louis is a smart dude.  And I never would have thought of that.  Cause you shoot a special, you just do what they tell you to do.  Uh-huh.  Right.  But he's like, no, no, no, get the audience pitch black.  And, you know, this is his second one.  He's done an hour.  And, uh, he's just a smart guy.  He talked about that on our show.  Oh, that's probably where he is.  That he wanted the audience dark.  He doesn't want to see them.  He doesn't want the.  So goddamn funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like he's doing, if he does a joke about, you know, a black guy or something, they got 
[00:36:00]  to go to the audience and cut to the black couple laughing.  It's just, it is just, I, I, it's, I'm not a big fan of that technique.  And when you think of great, like my favorite special ever is prior live in concert from  79.  And to address the audience, he introduced us Huey P.  Newton at one point.  Yeah.  He goes, turn the house lights up.  It's, I was going to say it's black, but obviously, but it's really, you could see a couple of  first, uh, people in the first rows, but it's dark.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a dark theater except for like the first couple of, uh, rows.  I mean, you can't see the audience. 
[00:36:30]  But his, uh, his material is just ridiculous.  I mean, he's talking about, you know, uh, uh, being at the beach and how, you know, people  let their little boys, cause he, he goes, he'd rather raise little girls than little  boys and talking about just little boys, creep them out and falling asleep.  And maybe one of the little boys just coming up and doing something horrible to his nostril  while he's sleeping.  Cause they're all, you know, running through the sprinkler.  He goes in there naked and you're just seeing their junk and stuff and the little kids and  he's sleeping and they're assaulting his nostrils. 
[00:37:00]  It's just, he is hysterical, really funny.  And then I wound up staying up for the whole goddamn thing and I was going to go to sleep  to it, you know, like, Oh, familiar voice.  Here's Louie's voice.  Let me, let me snooze off to Louie CK's voice.  But, uh, really goddamn funny.  Yeah.  Louie is a terrific.  And, uh, I, I haven't seen the special.  I won't see it.  No.  Nah.  It's just.  Oh, comics have a hard time.  You don't want to be influenced by someone.  You don't want to.  That's a shame because you're missing out on a lot of good stuff.  Like, you know, and still other stupid comics missing out on you. 
[00:37:30]  There's a good commercial.  Cause I'm going to go watch that tonight.  It's, it really is.  It's on Showtime.  Shoot up.  Yeah.  I mean, I heard it was great.  Really good.  I watched a lot of TV last night.  I watched that new show, um, life on Mars.  It's that, that show, a cop, he gets hit by a car, uh, in 2008 and apparently ends up  in 1973, uh, at the 125th precinct, New York city, a lot of corruption, funny hair and mutton 
[00:38:00]  chop sideburns and mustache and everything.  Old school cops.  Old school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Old school cops.  Just beating the crap out of perps for no reason.  Do they know him now when he's, when he turns up, do they know he was, he was, uh, they  see him as somebody who was transferred over from another precinct.  So, and he's just like, what the hell am I doing here?  You know, he, he doesn't know how he got there, why, but he does remember his previous  2008 life.  He knows everything that happens.  He knows, you know, uh, and he's, he's kind of this straight shooter, politically correct 
[00:38:30]  kind of cop.  And he's watching all these thug cops in 1973, corrupt New York city.  Uh, I really want to like the show a lot cause I think the idea of it is good.  It's a show that came from England to another show from England that we probably took and  claimed.  Oh yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  And, uh, Harvey Keitel is in it.  I think Harvey Keitel is really good.  I like him a lot.  It's on, uh, ABC.  Oh, it's a real.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh, the, the only complaint I have, and it's, it's only been on for two weeks and I've noticed 
[00:39:00]  this already.  We get it.  He's in 1973.  You don't have to make every reference from the seventies to remind us where, you know,  is it awkwardly done?  It's so ham handedly done.  Like a spoon fed, like a spoon.  Here we go.  We're going to remind you that it's the seventies.  There's a clip where, you know, there's a part of the show.  Harvey Keitel's in a hospital room with this girl that had gotten injured and, and he's,  she's unconscious and he's kind of reading the paper and he has to say something like, 
[00:39:30]  Oh, they're sending more people up to Skylab, you know, cause it's the seventies.  Why would that?  And, and, and just like, you know, Hey, that's about as useful as a pet rock.  You know, it's a, you don't have to, I wish they would stop that.  We know where he is.  You don't have to inject in a seventies reference every five minutes.  Is there a part of the show like where you're not a hundred percent sure if he, he obviously  had an injury of some sort, if the 2008 part is real or this, you don't know, you have 
[00:40:00]  no clue.  Like he doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  He wrote, he like in yesterday's episode, last night's, he drew a, wrote a whole bunch  of words like, uh, uh, insane.  He just goes alien abduction.  Like he's trying to figure out how this happened and, uh, why he's either really back in 73  thinks he is, if he's in a coma, if he's, you know, things like that.  So he's not sure that's why I love the idea of this.  I like any kind of time, you know, thing, there's another one, uh, back to the future. 
[00:40:30]  I love that, but it's like some, any kind of time thing like that.  I find pretty, uh, pretty cool.  One thing I really like about the show is, uh, they show, um, these, uh, these cops cause  they're detectives and they drive in, in regular cars and they're all these muscle cars.  And whenever they have to chase somebody or go to a location, they get a call.  They put the little cherry on the top of the car and drive like maniacs.  And the music takes on this seventies TV show kind of action, um, uh, Starsky and Hutch 
[00:41:00]  almost thing, which is, I found kind of funny the streets of San Francisco.  Yeah.  That they did that.  I thought that was pretty clever.  Um, but yeah, stop at the references every two seconds.  We understand where he is.  They should have a scroll.  I want to remind you that this is 1973 and he came from 2008.  Right.  The, the first episode was really cool because he, he comes out, uh, he, he initially gets  hit by a car and that's, he wakes up and, and he's kind of in 1973 and he looks around 
[00:41:30]  and looks, he's looking around like all confused and he looks and he goes, oh my God.  And they pan up in the, uh, twin towers are there and he's just like, oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  I thought that was like a really like, wow.  Kind of a moment for it.  That's kind of like a Tarleton Heston, uh, moment.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  It was like, whoa, whoa.  But I, I want to like the show, but.  Wouldn't it suck if the show ended and the final conclusion, what.  Oh no, go ahead, Jimmy.  And the final conclusion was like, no, no, no. 
[00:42:00]  What happens sometimes you will get hit by a car and actually wind up at a different  time.  That's all that happened.  He really did get hit.  That's the only excuse there is.  Yeah.  He really did get hit and, uh, he just wound up there and it was real and that's what happened.  And I always wonder that type of thing when you see these crazy people, maybe they're  not crazy.  Maybe they really know for real.  Maybe there was someone that was living in the future and had to come back to this time.  Who knows?  Another thing I like about the show is when they're, um, they bust people and they put  them up against the wall and frisk them and then just clock them in the head for no reason. 
[00:42:30]  Just pow.  And all the other detectives just kind of go, Hey, look at him.  They don't care.  Let's say hi to Jason in Indiana.  Jason.  Yeah.  I had a comment about life on Mars.  Okay.  I love it when they say, man, how great was Woodstock four years ago?  You know what I kind of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like how ham handed it is.  It's been four years already.  Like last night's episode, last night's episode.  That's funny.  There, there's, they, they, they, uh, pinch some guy, uh, supposedly he's been robbing this, 
[00:43:00]  uh, check cashing place.  They put him in jail and, uh, Harvey Keitel is just old school, dirty kind of cop.  Um, his, I think he wants to kind of clean up the city, but he doesn't care how he does  it.  So he's ready to plant some, some stuff on this guy just to put him away.  So 2008 cop is like, no, let's, you know, cut him loose.  We'll watch him get evidence on him and, and bust him, you know, the way it's supposed to  be done.  And, uh, so they let the guy loose and as he's walking out, he goes, yeah, the constitution 
[00:43:30]  at work.  Thank God for Richard Nixon.  Oh, and it's like, it's like, all right.  Uh, all right.  Thank you.  I forgot we were in 73.  I forgot.  Just spoon feeding a bunch of dummies.  That's what it is.  Kind of.  Could you smarten it up a little bit?  You don't have to remind me.  Can, can I ask you this?  You think there's a possibility that they're doing a kind of tongue in cheek?  Like, no, like wink, wink.  We know what we're doing here.  It's too many times during the episode. 
[00:44:00]  Don't it's just, it's done too many times.  Let's say hi to Tony in New York.  Tony life on Mars.  You know what?  I want to like this show.  Like you mentioned Anthony, but at the same time I find myself like bored with the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  I stick with it.  I'll stick with it.  A few more episodes.  I think Michael Imperioli, they got to use him a little more.  He looks hysterical in it.  I mean, he's got this big mustache that wraps around down to his chin. 
[00:44:30]  Huge sideburns, long, greasy hair.  And he's got like a pot belly on him now and stuff.  It just, his character, I think it could be really a good character.  But Michael Imperioli, they haven't really used him that much, but it's only been two episodes.  So I'm just hoping they kind of, there have been shows that you watch and at first you're  like, yeah, it's kind of good.  And then it ends up being a great show or kind of a really good show, whatever. 
[00:45:00]  I'm hoping that happens with this one.  But yeah, it's two episodes in.  They got to knock that off.  And yeah, kind of find a weird, different little angle on it, I think.  A lot of these shows find their way though.  Yeah, maybe.  You give it two or three episodes, next thing you know, it's a much different show than the  pilot was.  They may be looking at it too, like again, overkill.  But you know, maybe the way his shows are, within the first three episodes, people might  tune in the second one and miss the first one.  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.  That's what it just is. 
[00:45:30]  And it's distracting to me now whenever it happens, because I just go, all right.  Right.  Yeah, the Yankees are world champion thanks to Billy Martin.  We know.  He's alive.  Whatever.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Got it.  He's got a hat with a seven and a three on him.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Are you going to talk about the bills at the estate there?  Not the Buffalo bills.  I am a, I realized yesterday when I was opening up some of my envelopes, my bills, I am a one 
[00:46:00]  man environmental wrecking crew.  I am probably the biggest violator of all environmental, I don't know, I think I'm single-handedly  responsible for global warming at this point.  Boy.  Anthony, we'll explain next.  Also, audio of Obama and McCain being really, really funny.  That's that improv, that stand-up improv thing.  Yeah.  Got a little stand-up improv for ya.  I didn't even know this was on TV.  What a pleasant surprise.  We'll explain next, but first, the F.U. line for this Friday. 
[00:46:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.

Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Gut busting, ab crunching.  Boy, how bad can he get?  Have you seen a man eat his own head?  Yes.  Now you'll get used to it.  O.P.  Anthony spent $300 on fags. 
[00:48:00]  Ass clown.  Anthony.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  It should be illegal.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You guys, stop.  All that talk is crazy.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Hold on to your hats.  You're checking out O.P. and Anthony, the one-man environmental wrecking machine. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, that's apparently what I do.  What's that about?  I'm terrible, I guess.  I drive a gigantic SUV and a muscle car that really goes through a lot of gas.  But everyone knew that.  Yeah, but gas is cheaper now.  Yeah, so I don't care.  Burn it.  Let's break out the Escalades again.  Burn it.  We solved the gas problem.  Gas is down.  Let's start driving the big ones again.  The big cars. 
[00:49:00]  My electric bill came in yesterday.  And I have set a new record for myself.  Yeah?  Pretty proud.  Yeah.  What, on average, do you know what your electric bill is?  I have no idea.  Really?  I don't know.  Because I live at Condos.  I just don't know.  You don't pay for your own electric?  What?  I wouldn't know.  It's part of, like, Condos.  Probably your monthly maintenance and stuff.  Are you kidding?  You could just leave your lights on all night and someone else is going to pay it?  No, they'd charge extra. 
[00:49:30]  What?  I don't know how that works.  You have, like, condo maintenance fees and you have a-  Yeah, I understand that.  But isn't that for, like, garbage and things like that?  You have a basic fee and then they add the electric charges on top of that.  They do, right?  Yeah.  So how much is your electric?  You don't know?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't even know what a stamp costs.  Holy jeez.  You guys, do you do your own bills?  I definitely do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I sign checks.  Do you ever see one marked Con Edison?  I don't think it comes in like that.  No, we don't get no place.  It comes probably under the maintenance thing, which I pay electronically. 
[00:50:00]  Electronically?  What year is this?  Yes.  So it does it for me.  Okay.  And I don't even know what gas is going for.  I'm going to guess.  I would say that people are paying $320 right now.  For what?  Gasoline?  Yeah.  Is that true?  You're about-  Okay, good.  All right, good.  So I know that much.  I leave floodlights on.  My neighbors like it when I have floodlights out my windows into theirs.  You know what is really sad?  What? 
[00:50:30]  I have floodlights that shine on the front of my house.  Yeah, but the difference is, though, I'll say this.  I have a security in the thing.  It's like I have people downstairs.  You only have yourself and enough guns to kill a division of men.  Yeah.  He's probably safer is what you're saying, Jimmy.  Of course he is.  I have people, like, all of a sudden on my floor, like, what are you doing up here?  I'll tell you something else.  They aren't for security.  They are purely for aesthetics. 
[00:51:00]  Nice.  They're big halogen things that are in front of plantings on my front lawn.  So you don't see the actual lights.  But they shine up onto the house.  And when they first turn on, you can barely see it.  It's like a blue light.  And it takes about five minutes for these things to spool up to full power to where you're actually getting.  Because it just looks nice.  So why shouldn't it? 
[00:51:30]  Why not?  But those I've had since I bought the house.  I have a lot more lighting fixtures in the house now that Keith's wife, Ange, has decorated the house pretty much.  A lot more lighting fixtures.  I know.  When you first got in there for, like, the first two years, it was like Oldman's Place in Dracula.  Yeah, it was.  Every room looked like an interrogation room.  One bulb hanging from a wire.  A metal chair in the middle.  A little table with cards on it.  A phone book to hit people with.  You've come a long way. 
[00:52:00]  Not even in a year.  Like six months.  Well, I had to.  You just changed the whole thing around, man.  Now it's a real house with a real pool and cabana.  Oh, it's.  Fire pit to burn stuff in.  It's wonderful.  And it just.  Jacuzzi.  Like I said, it just eats up.  I, um.  But heating the pool, right?  Yeah.  And the jacuzzi.  Yeah.  The pool heater eats up fuel at a rate I've never seen in my life.  I've never.  I think it's probably equal to the main tank on the shuttle. 
[00:52:30]  Uh.  What it takes to heat the pool per month.  How hot is your pool?  A hundred?  I like it about 110 degrees in the winter.  Do you?  No.  It's.  I'm actually getting it covered up next week.  Are you supposed to or it doesn't matter?  Yeah.  You're supposed to.  You don't want the lines freezing up.  How about the jacuzzi?  Jacuzzi's part of the pool.  You covering that up?  So I have to cover that up too.  Oh.  But I have, I have, uh, other options.  I could get an actual, just a jacuzzi put somewhere. 
[00:53:00]  Are you going to do that?  Just for, I don't know.  I got my winter entertainment going in now, which is a, the, the home theater.  Wait a minute.  I was looking forward.  Yes.  To a winter jacuzzi.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I have no friends.  I think I'm going to, I'm going to look into that.  I'll take care of that.  You should have a jacuzzi closing party.  Um, well, you got about a week.  No, but you set the day.  Like this is the last day for the jacuzzi.  Everyone come on over and relieve yourself in it.  Let's see. 
[00:53:30]  My winter is prepared.  It has been structured around your house.  My house.  Yeah.  Damn it.  I could, I could just get another jacuzzi.  I could work.  Knowing you, you will.  So.  I think I will.  All right.  Uh, because why, you know, not burn, uh, uh, unbelievable amounts of fuel, uh, during  the winter also.  Mm-hmm.  Well, the oil tanks in my house, there are two of them.  They look like freight trains in the basement.  And you can almost watch the gauge go down if you stand close enough. 
[00:54:00]  Uh, you should, you should go old school and get one of those like old, uh, you know,  guys that just shovels coal into something.  That's what I want.  Some guy that looks like he was in the Titanic engine room.  Yeah, there you go.  Exactly.  Just covered with coal dust.  Then there's, uh, the electric bill.  That's what I was talking about.  The electric bill.  Um, it was $1,650.  Wow.  Uh, yeah.  Wow. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  $1,600 for the month.  And I believe that is because of the constantly spinning motors for the pool and jacuzzi and  the blowers for the jacuzzi and everything else.  Yes.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, Ant's electric meter spins like a DVD.  Is that true?  Does round and round?  I can't even see it.  It's a blur.  Does your meter have a...  Actually, the carpenters, uh, working on it when their saw breaks down, they just use  my electric meter spinning to cut wood with. 
[00:55:00]  $1,600.  Like what?  $1,600.  $1,600.  Yeah.  I opened it up yesterday and that, that's an all time high.  I am using electricity.  Uh, I, I, I guess the other houses, their bulbs dim when I get home.  Can we do some quick math?  How many houses would that, uh, take care of?  $1,600, $1,600?  I would imagine, well, I don't really know.  It's, it's a lot.  At least $1,600?  Yeah.  See what I do also?  I'm really bad.  I leave a lot of TVs on so that no matter what room I go into, I don't miss the show. 
[00:55:30]  I like doing that too.  Yeah.  The TVs aren't like sucking up too much energy.  Really?  These days?  These days, the plasmas and the-  Are you scared of being in a big old house by yourself, like, lonely?  No.  You know what it is?  If I'm alone in the house, which isn't that often, if you know what I mean, that a boy.  Do you have a lot of friends over?  No.  Uh, it, uh, I find myself, and I was, I was talking about this the other day.  I just kind of walk around and, and I'll stop in a corner and just kind of look. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, I thought you were going to say, and get in the fetal position and cry.  And cry, no.  And then I'll just walk over somewhere else and look and think, what should I do?  Hmm, hmm, hmm, more walking.  And then I'll just plop down in front of the computer or the TV.  Yeah.  I have, um, I have a lot of computers that are running all the time.  I don't know how much, you know, that uses, but, uh, and then lights.  Like I said, a lot of light fixtures are in there now.  And, um, I'm not, I haven't been very good with shutting them off lately, you know? 
[00:56:30]  Or lately I've been better, but in the past I haven't.  I have to go to this phone call because people are doing their own math.  Joe in Vermont, go ahead.  Yeah, I ran a welding business, and I don't pay $1,600 a year in electricity.  All right, so a year's worth of a welding business.  I hope it's exclusively oxy-acetylene and not, um, he's not doing arc welding because 
[00:57:00]  then I'd really feel bad.  That's really funny.  You got something going on.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  And then the other thing that happened, and I know this isn't my fault.  I have to, I, I, I, Keith called, um, the company that put in my cabana, um, because  I think I have a plumbing leak, um, right by one of the, the gates on the side of the  house.  Did he call Joe the plumber?  I didn't call Joe the plumber.  Why would I call him?  Oh, look, uh. 
[00:57:30]  That ass.  I hope his business fails.  Go screw Joe the plumber.  We hate Joe the, the, the, well, I can't say it over here.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever he is.  Joe the log handler.  Thank you.  Put one over his shoulder.  That's what I was getting at.  Sorry, Anthony.  That's all right.  Uh, yeah, so, um, I, cause I, I got my water bill yesterday and, um, oh my God, look at  him trying to take this guy down.  Sorry.  I'm so distracted.  The news plays these clips really quick.  So I, I get my water bill and, um, I went through 197,000 gallons of water. 
[00:58:00]  In one month?  No, that was maybe two months.  What do they do?  Every other month?  Three months.  Oh, three, three months.  Yeah.  A hundred and ninety seven thousand gallons.  And that was after the pool was already filled.  So it wasn't to fill the pool.  You're going to get arrested.  This was just like, and it was something like $380 for a water bill that is usually, 
[00:58:30]  you know, 30 bucks or something like that.  Is the neighborhood stealing your pool water?  I, I don't know.  I think there's a leak.  So I shut off the water to the cabana yesterday.  I'm going to see if this dries up and, uh, we call the guy to come, you know, and dig that  lineup and, and check for a leak because it's soggy there all the time.  So obviously something's running into the ground.  A hundred and ninety seven thousand gallons.  I thought you were going to tell me that I'm not allowed to visit anymore. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, well.  Cause I got a sour stomach.  Yeah.  And I didn't realize it was using that much water.  When you go into the, yeah.  Into the toity.  You're going to go home and your house is going to float by like Evan almighty.  Right.  Cool me a boy's house just floated away.  It's a, that's, that's insane.  It's ridiculous.  And I got both of those bills in one day.  So I was just looking going, Oh my God, I am a disaster.  Yeah.  I am Al Gore's nightmare when it comes to this carbon footprint, like the grand Canyon. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  I'm, I'm terrible.  I'm really trying better to shut the lights off.  Red in Louisiana.  He goes, well, aunt, that's from putting out fires.  Oh, maybe that's, maybe that's what all the water's from putting up clothing fires.  People are amazed.  They're like, I don't even pay that in rent.  For the, you know, the $1,600 electric bill.  I turn the lights off when I leave a room or when I go like, when I go out, everything goes off. 
[01:00:00]  I don't.  You should.  I don't know why.  I sometimes, you know, I think my TV's on right now in my bedroom for nobody.  Yeah.  Because I don't want to turn it off.  So it'll be quiet from my walk from the bedroom downstairs.  I don't know.  I like noise.  What do you need?  You're like Nicholson, the Overlook hotel.  Hell, you don't need constant excitement.  Just let it be mellow for a minute.  Enjoy the silence.  A naked old dead lady in this tub and a great party, isn't it?  And blood in the elevators.  A great party. 
[01:00:30]  You're going to hold yourself.  There's nothing wrong with silence.  Brady's in my bathroom.  Just be still.  Cleaning off some avocado.  Listen to the crickets every once in a while.  I don't like the crickets.  Tim in New York.  Tim.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Ant, maybe your water bill's a little high because you were spending so much time washing  the sheets after a certain ex-girlfriend spent the night over.  Oh, boy.  I don't think it's from the laundry.  Oh, boy.  Hey, everyone's doing their math, Ant, for you.  197,000 gallons is enough water to irrigate an entire golf course for 15 minutes. 
[01:01:00]  What are you doing?  See, that's what I wanted to know.  I wanted to know how much water that was.  You know, somewhere, probably most of the basements in your neighborhood have flooded  and they can't figure out.  They don't know where it's coming from.  They can't figure it out.  They don't know where it's coming from.  Just a slow flooding going on constantly.  Wow.  God damn.  Did you say you and your friends are over there drinking?  Are you guys drinking alcohol or are you just scooping cups into the pool and swinging  it?  Yeah.  Tim in PA has got something. 
[01:01:30]  Tim?  Yeah.  I just got my electric bill yesterday.  I got a family of five, three little kids.  All-time high, $168.  You paid $168, Ant.  You paid $1,650.  Okay.  This guy, James, figured it out.  He says it's only 1.5 gallons per minute.  It's a slow leak.  One and a half gallons a minute.  Every minute?  Is what I'm going through?  Every minute?  And it's still only $380. 
[01:02:00]  The water, the planet is, what is it, 70% water?  Yeah.  We don't worry about water.  We're living on it.  Yeah.  Water's okay.  There's more of it than the stuff we live on.  You're right.  Plus your pool is salt water.  You drive to the ocean.  You get a bunch of friends.  Everybody holds a bucket in their lap in the car.  You throw it in for free.  It's got a salt water filled chlorination system.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's from the ocean.  Literal Anthony.  Tanking.  Yeah.  I have sharks in there.  That's pretty amazing, Ant. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  I was proving that you certainly are a Republican, by the way.  Yes.  Al Gore is like giving you the...  No, I bring it up because I obviously have to do something.  I have to do something.  I have to, you know, shut lights out.  No.  Because even I'm realizing that's a bit much.  You don't have to do anything.  Keith has to do something.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Keith made the phone call about the leak.  Of course he did.  But the electric thing is, I'm sure, it's from all those pool motors going constantly. 
[01:03:00]  I think they're...  You know the pool pump motors?  Mm-hmm.  I got four of them lined up.  It's like a 747 out back.  And they're all just constantly humming 24-7 for the entire summer.  WING!  All right.  Joe in Texas.  Joe.  Hey.  The 197,000 gallons is a town of 1,000 water tower. 
[01:03:30]  So you know those water towers you see in the small towns?  Yeah.  That's what you wasted in three months or two months, whatever it was.  Really?  And then this guy has got...  Nate, we've got truckers all over the place.  I want to say good morning to the truckers.  How are you?  Nate, what's up?  That's about 43 tanker trucks worth of water.  43 tanker trucks?  I went through 43 tanker trucks of water?  Maybe check the leaky faucet.  Yeah, I think I got a drip.  Wow. 
[01:04:00]  There's a drip in the bathroom, I think.  Can you bring that in?  I don't believe you.  No, I know.  We've got to get a shot of that on the website.  It's legit.  197,000 gallons.  197,000 gallons of water.  What does the average house go through, though?  Is it 10,000?  Like, I don't know what...  I have no...  What is the average usage for an average American family?  With a pool.  And I'm one guy.  I'm one guy in the house.  Well...  So it's not like...  You're one hotel operator.  Well, I have that.  That is true. 
[01:04:30]  Who are you kidding?  Do I have company every so often?  I imagine there's seven showers going on at the same time.  Oh, the shower.  Yeah, there's a big shower head.  Oh, Danny?  Yes, Danny.  It says here the average water usage per person is 200 gallons.  A month?  Per day.  200 gallons per day.  Per day?  Showering, soaping up, rinsing up, four gallons per person.  Brushing your teeth.  Rinsing briefly is a half a gallon.  Shaving is a gallon.  Where does all those big gallons come in, then?  Well, let's see. 
[01:05:00]  If you take a bath...  Washing machine.  10 to 14 gallons.  Flushing a toilet, four to six gallons.  Washing dishes, five gallons.  A dishwasher is seven gallons.  Washing machine is a 27-gallon.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a lot of laundry getting done.  Yeah.  Keith does the laundry.  So wait...  And it says here even a small drip can add up to 25 gallons per day.  So 6,000 gallons.  You do 30 days a month times 200 gallons a day is about 6,000 for the average person.  6,000 for the average person. 
[01:05:30]  That's a month.  Right.  So you figure...  Well, once the pool is full, you got to allow for like evaporation is pretty much it.  I have an auto fill on the pool, so I don't have to drop a hose in there.  So I don't really...  I don't know if it goes down, how far it goes down before it's got to be filled up.  But it's not that much.  If you have a pool, once the pool's full, you're not refilling it every month.  I just realized something.  You are rich.  No, no.  I'm just really bad. 
[01:06:00]  You are rich.  I'm really bad at like taking care of things.  I should shut the lights out.  Someone's like, oh, Ant obviously makes more money than you.  We just kind of look at it differently.  No, I spend more money.  I'm very...  I'm old school.  I'm convinced that, you know, this all goes away tomorrow.  Well, I am too.  That's why, you know, the things I do to my home are, you know, it's equity in my house.  You're just making up for lost time. 
[01:06:30]  You never had a house, and then when you had this house, you didn't do anything with it.  I lived in my Chevy Monza.  I had to live in a Chevy Monza.  Boy, he's living the life of Riley.  He sure is, Jimmy.  $6,000 a person.  So you figure you always have Keith there and a couple of friends.  Let's just say you have five people using $6,000.  Dude, how about your...  $30,000 a month, it should be.  I got $30,000, and it's 197,000 gallons.  I got the solution.  Turn off a few TVs.  Yeah.  Fix the leak. 
[01:07:00]  Uh-huh.  And then vote for Obama.  Obama?  Because then you got the extra money to throw to the people behind you.  I don't...  That's a big stretch, isn't it?  I'm starting to hate Obama now.  The thing...  See what I'm doing, though?  Let me tell you what I'm doing.  I'm keeping the economy going.  I'm keeping the economy going.  I'm not pulling back.  Anthony...  Spend, spend.  You're pulling me now more toward McCain because I'm looking more into this tax thing.  If I get taxed more, I'm going to stop spending.  You people are going to be screwed.  What's up with 40% of Americans not paying taxes? 
[01:07:30]  What's that about?  First it was 30 to 35.  Now they're saying 40.  40.  That's because the other...  Are they below the poverty line?  A lot of people make really bad money in this country.  Yeah.  Like, hard...  It's like we forget because most people we know at least live in New York.  So, I mean, like the guys we know, it's not even if they're just average income, they're  making enough to survive in Manhattan or Long Island.  Yeah, yeah.  True.  So you forget a big part of this country, man.  People have nothing.  Like, they literally are paying a couple hundred dollars a month in rent. 
[01:08:00]  They have dumps.  I say business as usual.  Just build a lot of fences to keep them contained.  All right.  In their areas.  I'm for that.  In their areas.  Kane should come out with that on his platform.  What do you got?  Break time?  All right.  I'm totally out of touch with...  Let me just talk to Tony.  I want to see what I'm out of touch with.  Sure.  Tony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  I live in Huntington Bay.  And, you know, I'm not a rich guy.  But you know what, man?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sorry, Tony.  But if you're living in Huntington Bay, you're kind of a rich guy. 
[01:08:30]  I'm not.  You're not getting that one past us.  It's not Huntington Station.  I grew up in Centerport.  We know the area.  We know the area very well.  Huntington Bay is where a lot of rich people, you know, whatever.  Hang that hat.  You know what?  I spent $400 on my electric bill over three months.  You know, I have a pool.  My water bill is $46 a month.  You're out of control, man. 
[01:09:00]  And, Opie, I met you at Starbucks on Mother's Day and Father's Day.  You know who I am.  Geez, that sounded like a threat.  You know who I am.  Don't you forget.  Mother's Day and Father's Day where?  In Huntington?  Yeah, at Starbucks.  Okay.  You don't know who we are.  But we know who you are.  Takes his license.  All right.  Good to see you, Tony.  Look, I'm not saying this to say I'm out of touch or in touch or anything.  I'm just saying I shouldn't have a water bill that high and there's a leak.  Yeah.  And then my electric bill, I got to start shutting lights off. 
[01:09:30]  Like, I had a little revelation last night when I opened that up.  You keep almost every light on?  No.  It's just the lights I keep on are lights.  Dude, I was trained as a kid.  Like, I can leave lights on now and I don't.  Like, I got these dumb effing issues from when I was growing up.  I'm turning lights off constantly.  I'm like, why am I doing this?  I don't need to do this anymore.  There are useful lights to see stuff in the dark.  And then there are decorative lights. 
[01:10:00]  I guess I, you know, I got to cut back on my decorative lighting.  Yeah.  Tell Keith to get the decorative lighting out of your house.  No.  You're trying to get laid.  What is he doing?  That'll help.  Shows fanciness.  I like my decorative lighting.  Girls like fanciness.  Of course they do.  When a girl, when you're banging a girl in her early 20s, she doesn't come over and go,  he's a fiscally responsible man.  She goes, he's an ass.  And so am I.  Yes.  Early 20s don't look at the decorative lights. 
[01:10:30]  I'm telling you.  No.  That's going to attract the cougars.  What?  The cougars like that decorative stuff.  I'll rig the decorative light to fall on their head.  There's no way.  They like fancy, like a big, it's like a big palace.  Right.  They go into a kingdom, a magic kingdom.  Treated like a queen.  That's right.  Literally a queen.  I don't know.  Oh.  What do you got, Johnny in Kansas?  Did we do you yet?  No, you did.  And that's enough water to flush your toilet 123,000 times. 
[01:11:00]  I'm going to try that.  That's right.  Maybe I have been a little upset stomach going to the bathroom every second.  What am I doing?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, all right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to get into some Obama McCain stuff because I was like doing what you were  doing.  I turned the TV on, figured I'd fall asleep to something.  I'm watching Hannity.  I don't know why I watch Hannity because I don't really agree with him, but he's a friend  and I like him.  I like the guy.  He has passion for what he does, although I don't really like Combs at all. 
[01:11:30]  And all of a sudden they're doing this Obama McCain thing at the Al Smith dinner.  And maybe Stumper and after the break could explain this whole thing, but these guys are  doing a roast.  They're roasting each other.  Yeah.  Do they do this every year?  Yeah.  With different politicians?  Al Smith was a governor of New York way back.  Al.  And when he died, it was just before the election.  So the Cardinal said, wow, here's a great opportunity.  They brought in the candidates and they've been doing it ever since. 
[01:12:00]  And it falls on election years.  They bring the presidential candidates and it's for Catholic charities.  I got to tell you, well, we'll get into that.  We'll get into it after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Cody in Indiana writes on Instant Feedback.  I can't wait to see Ant's electric bill after Keith's wife decorates the Christmas lights  brighter than the effing Luxor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were talking about Christmas lights and stuff yesterday.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  And yeah.  Yeah.  Because I kind of want to do Christmas over my house kind of a thing.  Yeah.  We do Christmas Eve over Grandma's old house.  Now it's, you know, my aunt and uncle's house pretty much.  I love it too.  I'm poking up lights.  Yeah.  You really are a true WAP, aren't you?  I am such a gin, gin, gin, yeah, I really am because, well, I'm really the only Catholic  in my neighborhood.  Oh, that's right.  It's an entire Jewish neighborhood.  And you wouldn't let it be known. 
[01:13:00]  I put, I put decorations up that, it leaves no doubt that I am Catholic.  It's, I, this short of a manger on my lawn with the baby Jesus.  You would go with real people though.  Yeah.  Make them hang out.  That's a good idea.  Cheap to have.  Hey, tell them about the wreath you get.  The wreath is probably nine feet across.  They have to get a crane.  They get a cherry picker and put it up above my door.  Biggest wreath you've ever seen.  And then there's a couple of real guinea columns that I have on the side of my house. 
[01:13:30]  And big, big red bows go on the big guinea columns.  Yeah.  And lights going up the walkway and on the trees.  So, yeah, the Jews in my neighborhood are just like, oh boy, here he goes.  Here goes the Italian again.  It's going to be another Massapequa before we know it.  Here he is.  I'm sure all of his organized crime friends are going to be over.  But this other celebrity friend, I go, what other show do you listen to? 
[01:14:00]  And they're talking about arc welding.  Yes.  He's like, hey, watch out.  I'm warning you.  Well, he opened his bills yesterday and they're just out of hand.  I'm really hurting the environment.  He used 197,000 gallons of water since the last water bill.  197,000 gallons.  And Stunt Brain brings this to everyone's attention today.  When you have huge spikes in usage like you're showing, you know they investigate that stuff because they're convinced you're growing pot and stuff. 
[01:14:30]  Why would they think because I had a spike in water and electricity that I'm growing something?  But they really do.  That really is like water and electricity.  I need the lights for the plants and then I need the water to irrigate the plants.  And there's no plants growing in my house.  The investigation ends with the guy just writing across the top of his sheet, Enrich.  No problem. 
[01:15:00]  Enrich, no problem.  We're moving on from this case.  By which I mean nouveau riche.  Of course nouveau riche.  What else could that mean?  You're telling everyone you're putting a movie theater in the basement, but maybe you're doing something else.  No, no, it's a home theater.  There's a lot of room in that basement, man.  I had the...  You're a crass fool.  Your basement's so big.  If you weren't growing pot plants, you'd have to get the migrant workers there.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got them there.  Who's he kidding?  He's using Americans to fix that house up?  They're all Americans.  Oh, please.  My friend, they are. 
[01:15:30]  All the construction guys in the basement.  Yeah, Central Americans.  All Americans.  I had the HVAC guy come over yesterday, which was pretty interesting for me, since I spent all of my years before radio doing air conditioning and heating work.  So I see the van pull up, and I'm like, now I'm that guy.  I go, I'm the ass.  I'm the douche.  It just made me feel like...  And then I'm trying to be overly nice and, hey, what's up? 
[01:16:00]  Like, not be like those guys, there's a hose out back if you're thirsty.  You know?  Like, I all of a sudden was the guy, and no matter what I do, I'm the guy.  Right, right, right.  Which sucks.  That's great.  Like, I don't want to be the guy, but I don't want to be the guy doing the work anymore.  I did that for years.  They don't do it right.  You've got to regretfully go, oh, yeah.  I'm drinking it.  See?  No, Anthony's bringing up the old days, and the old air conditioner's like, hey, you've still got that fetter.  Oh, no, we've got new equipment now that we do that. 
[01:16:30]  What do you got?  Let me see the gauges.  I'll charge this unit myself.  Bring me the Freon.  We don't use Freon anymore.  Sir.  Just vent it to the atmosphere, and we'll pump some more.  No, we recover the refrigerant now, Anthony.  Not like the old days.  They're old-timer.  He's going to roll up his sleeves.  Yeah, let me get in there.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  You guys would just dump the waste on the side of the LIA.  I love it.  As you're going back to home.  It used to be vent. 
[01:17:00]  That's old school, my friend.  Vent to atmosphere.  Yeah.  Fluorocarbons just...  This big white cloud of ozone killer would just...  Rises of a floral pocket.  Yeah.  Now they will kill you if they catch you doing that.  You've got to recover the refrigerant.  And call Freon, it's refrigerant.  Yeah, it's like Russia.  You can't even throw any things in the atmosphere.  You can't even put your frigging motor oil down the sewer anymore.  What's up with that? 
[01:17:30]  Colin, how many times did you change your oil on your car and just let it go right down the sewer in front of your house?  Most people are still doing that.  That's what you did.  No, you are...  A lot of people still do that.  But they are doing that.  In trashy neighborhoods, I guess.  Yeah.  In Mastic.  They look to their left.  They look to their right.  And they took over that can.  Hey, I'm going to get abused from my family from having fun of Shirley.  Shirley.  Well, Mastic and Shirley.  Yeah, of course.  You know...  The Twin Cities.  I was a caddy for 12, 14 years. 
[01:18:00]  Caddy.  And every once in a while, we'll play in a charity golf tournament or whatever.  And we'll get a caddy.  And I'm just reminded what you were doing with the air conditioner guy.  I go, hey, I used to do what you're doing there.  Yeah, correct.  And I actually had a caddy go, good for you.  No one wants to hear that.  The guy just did not.  It was good for you.  No one wants to hear that.  Here's your putter.  I'm the same age as you.  And you're not doing this anymore.  And I still am.  Good for you.  No one wants to hear that you did that and you can help him out.  No one cares about your local boy made good. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, beat it, stupid.  And by the way, you had a seven on the last hole, not a five.  Poor bastard's got to move my radio-controlled jet helicopters so he can put in some flex pipe.  Oh, you stand there with a naked 19-year-old.  Hey, I used to knock, 10.  Drinking of beer.  Wine glass in one hand, a supple breast in the other.  A party hat, magnum condoms in your upper pocket.  I used to do what you did until my life began. 
[01:19:00]  Doing the obstacle course through the women that are passed out.  Oh, is that awful?  Get to the work area.  Yeah, but when I realized, like, I'm the guy.  I'm the guy that was the douche.  That's so funny.  Stop trying to kidnap.  Bob Kelly does that, too.  We used to live in the same building.  Dad!  He's the biggest idiot.  We lived in the same building.  What, with fat people?  I used to be a big slob, dude!  Just one big freight elevator.  Now he's losing weight and ruining our good time.  Bastard. 
[01:19:30]  But he's, uh...  The beautiful thing about Bob is, though, he really is like...  No, but he's like...  He's one, like, cut out of a Dane movie away from obesity again, which is great.  Because Bob will never not be a fatso waiting to happen.  Bobby would walk in...  We would always walk into the lobby, and he would just stand there and overly try to  be relatable.  Hey, how you doing there, Frank?  Just like, shut up.  They work here.  Just say hello.  Yeah.  And go upstairs.  Stop trying to act like you're one of the guys because you feel guilty about the minimal  success that you've had.  Hey, we gotta go to the phones. 
[01:20:00]  You touched on some, Ant, that got him lit.  Wayne, go ahead.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Wayne?  When I worked at a gas station, like, years ago, for all the bad pollutants that we did,  we used to just dump antifreeze down the drain because my boss told us, so he was too cheap  to pay any type of recovery fee, which I thought was very disgusting and despicable, but...  Oh, I'm sure you did, but you did it anyway.  I was only following orders.  And we wonder why we're all getting cancer.  Everyone's getting cancer, and we're like, we can't figure out why.  Dude, I had a...  I don't know how the polar bears are purple. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  I had a Volkswagen bug.  I had a Volkswagen bug that I made into one of those bug, dune buggy, hybrid Baja bug things.  You made it cool.  Yeah, I tried.  Was that when you were out in L.A. with the...  No, no, this was...  Yeah, yeah, Jimmy Jackson.  Actually, they had dune buggies, of course.  Why wouldn't they?  And I blew an engine into the thing and had to tell his squaw that he was a homo.  Think about it. 
[01:21:00]  I got it.  Think about it.  I dumped the entire engine down into the sewer.  I pulled up the grate, and somewhere in the avenues in Northport is a sewer with a Volkswagen  engine in it.  Just oil.  Everything just dripping out of it.  Who cared?  Who cared?  Oh, that's good stuff.  Colin, why are you here, by the way?  I got my joke.  Are we promoting it?  I got it.  I'm kidding.  What are you promoting today?  I would beg for any...  Caroline.  Really?  I would beg for acceptance. 
[01:21:30]  Stop.  We do that for five hours a day.  Yeah.  Begging for love and acceptance.  You there this week?  Don't just jump in like you're Mr. Professional, like you can carry on two conversations.  But no, I didn't want to...  I'm so mentally...  Oh.  Yeah.  I was paying attention, Colin.  Shut up.  No, I was asking...  Opie asked me in a civilized manner.  Nobody even introduced me now.  I was here yet, by the way.  My name was not...  No, you don't have to.  You're just...  The voice.  Hush.  No one knows your voice by now.  Hush.  But no, me and Ann were talking about something, and you guys did the plug-in. 
[01:22:00]  I'm like, why do I...  I know, but I just don't like you acting like you're Mr. Dexterity, like, oh, by the  way, what are you plugging?  Like, I'm on every level.  And why do you need the big intro all of a sudden?  Yeah, what do you need?  What's wrong with you?  Nothing.  Sit down and start talking.  We'll get to your name eventually.  That's what I did.  Yeah, we know you are.  Ladies and gentlemen, we got to stop the show because...  Oh, my God.  Coming into our studio.  As we've been promising and promoting.  Right.  Just sit down.  That voice, it would be like...  Sit down and tell jokes.  Like if Rosie Perez came in, we wouldn't have to intro her either. 
[01:22:30]  So, Colin's at Caroline's...  Rosie Perez coming in?  No.  Colin Quinn, Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah.  Tonight, obviously.  I'll give out the number.  212-757-4100.  Yeah.  For tickets.  No, I just didn't like Jim's new angle.  Like, he covers all bases.  Yeah, it's the way I do it, you know.  I went to the...  We'll go to Colin now.  Yeah, but he just busted in like, I can do 10 things at once.  Oh, and you'll be proud that they're still going old school out there.  Oh, good.  Nick in New York.  Hey, Nick.  What's up, man?  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  You're on the air, sir. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, no.  I just wanted to let you know that I work for an HR company.  I'm actually going there right now.  But we still vented a free on it this year.  We actually bought it, like the home bucket or whatever from Depot, put a free on line in it.  And we just dumped a free on to that and we still vented and stuff.  You know what he's saying?  Because the phone was all messed up.  He's just saying he's still opening up the valve and dumping free on right onto the go.  Yeah, I'm still dumping free on.  The two years I've been there, I never once put into a recovery system. 
[01:23:30]  Are you even certified?  I don't know.  I mean...  I don't know.  I don't know.  How did you get certified?  Dude, you are every helper I ever had.  I used to call them no helpers.  There was no help.  It was like, just fall asleep on the insulation.  Let's say hi to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Joe, the AC guy. 
[01:24:00]  What's up, Eric?  How you doing?  Yeah, when I was in the United States Navy, I was ordered to pump 1,800 gallons of used oil into the ocean.  It's just...  See, this is what's really going on out there.  And then you get some dopey lady bringing her own bag to the supermarket thinking she's making a change.  That's great.  Just take the plastic bag like the rest of us.  I was ordered since I'm 18,000.  Ordered.  I love that.  Ordered.  Because he knows he's got to answer to God someday.  Yes, sir.  They told me. 
[01:24:30]  I was like, God.  The only time he ever confessed was right now.  Yeah, yeah.  I was ordered.  And you will pump that fuel out into the ocean.  Yeah.  Let's go to Dan in New York.  Hey, Dan.  Dan?  Dan?  Yes?  That's me, Dan.  Hey, man.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, my dad's auto body shop.  There was this one spot in front of the shop where we dump all the old oil and fluids and everything.  My dad started growing tomatoes there, like, after 20 years of dumping. 
[01:25:00]  What?  He started giving the tomatoes out to all the vendors and customers that came by.  It's just one tomato gives you tumors.  It just gets worse.  Yeah.  Now he's growing stuff for people to eat in the oil.  The poison.  In the poison soil.  To the other vendors.  Here you go.  How great is that?  How about a nice tomato?  Yeah, here you go.  You know what you don't see anymore that you used to see a lot of?  The abandoned car. 
[01:25:30]  That was a phenomenon on the expressway, the parkways, here in New York especially.  That's right.  The abandoned car was on the side of the road, just stripped and sitting there.  I wish one of my brothers would call.  Brett tells a hilarious story.  My dad was one of those guys.  He was an abandoned car guy?  Yeah, a car got stolen, saving money, insurance.  He would dump them under the bridges, you know, coming into New York City.  They're, like, stolen.  Like, on the road.  You'd see it on the side of the expressway, the parkways, just stripped cars. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  You wouldn't even think about it.  But those aren't cars that break down.  Those are cars that people are, like, dumping them.  I did that once.  You crowbar out the VIN number?  Yeah.  I did that.  But then my dad would come home with some ridiculous story, but we were on to him.  But when he got older, this is where the bit's going.  A mile away from the house in a parking lot that we go to a lot.  You know Friendly's up near, you know, on 25A?  Oh, certainly.  Across the street a little further toward my house. 
[01:26:30]  I'd throw fribbles on my back there.  There's our Toyota sitting there.  And my dad's denying it's our Toyota.  Nah, look away.  No license plates?  We're like, Dad, it's right up the street.  What are you doing?  Nope, nope.  That ain't it.  Just looks like it.  We have license plates on ours.  We're talking about it.  Stax was always crazy.  I found a car.  It had prints all over it.  It had a Geneseo sticker in the back window where I went to college.  Oh, you've got to hear my brother tell it.  It's like, Dad, what do you, you know, we understand if you're going to go into Brooklyn 
[01:27:00]  or the Bronx, but, you know, you're getting lazy.  You left it right there.  You're getting lazy.  Well, a lot of people go to Geneseo.  It's a big school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably what he said at the time.  I think a lot of cars, if you broke down on the expressway or one of the parkways,  you knew your car was screwed.  Like, they were just roving bands of hooligans that would take the tires, the doors.  They'd work like ants taking apart a cricket.  Yeah.  It would really, they were very proficient at it.  And that just doesn't happen anymore. 
[01:27:30]  Dumping Freon is a $10,000 fine.  Yeah, you really get screwed for that one.  And now we go to Indiana.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Pardon me.  When I was stationed in Virginia Beach in the Navy, as you may be aware, towards the end  of the fiscal year, government agencies have to use their budget up or they lose it the  following year.  So we would go ahead and gas up the planes.  They'd fly them out over the Atlantic and they'd dump JP5 into the ocean, come back,  fill up, repeat process.  Wow. 
[01:28:00]  Repeat process.  Dump jet fuel into the ocean.  Repeat process.  Come back until your tanks are dry and they could say, well, we need the money for this  much fuel again.  Repeat process.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  The blivets that hang off the wings, they hold like 300 gallons each or something like  that.  I can't remember how many tons of fuel it is.  But an A-6 used to hold about 18,000 tons.  Just dropping full wing tanks.  That plane could fly from Virginia Beach to California without gassing up and it was back 
[01:28:30]  empty in 15 minutes.  Wow.  Where else would you hear the reality of America?  And this is what, you know, when I see, that's why, when I see Obama or McCain and they're  talking about taxes and spending and stuff, it's like, you're all full of crap.  Just shut up.  This is business as usual.  You want to cut the budget down?  Take care of that kind of stuff.  Unbelievable. 
[01:29:00]  But we're all going.  You do too, man.  Thanks.  But we're all going green.  Yeah, we're going green, all right.  Yeah, we're going green.  That's great.  Colin Quinn and Caroline's this weekend.  We're going to take a break.  Enough fuel to fly cross-country.  Gone in 15 minutes.  Speaking of comedy, did you see Obama and McCain doing the funny line?  No, I did not.  Stand up there.  Funny guy.  You can see it on the break.  A couple of zingers.  Well, I want to get your opinion on the whole thing.  Only one.  I know.  I'm a zinger.  As a seasoned veteran, I want to get your opinion on the whole thing.  I'd like to see it.  All right.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  We're back.  You want to kick him in the balls now?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got Colin Quinn in studio today.  Whoa.  Opie and Anthony.  What an intro.  Now people know I'm here.  Caroline's this weekend.  212-757-4100.  And I'm so glad you're here today because you brought it to everyone's attention about Jimmy  and his obsession with his brand new camera.  I know.  And he really came up.  He's been talking about his brand new camera for the last four days.  He snarled on me, too. 
[01:30:00]  All he's doing is reading a manual.  I never read the manual.  I never do.  I just point and shoot.  And my last camera is probably a good camera.  Are we talking about cameras now?  No.  Come on.  Don't be fresh.  I had a Sony, which maybe took a good picture, but I just didn't know how to use it.  I hear you.  This is compelling.  This is the thing.  No, it is.  It's good.  I go to B&H.  It's a funny story.  Big lines.  I'm like, what am I going to do, right?  Big lines of Jews, right?  No, no.  All people.  The Jews were. 
[01:30:30]  I don't like to be stereotypical.  They know how to run that place.  They sure do.  That place is fantastic.  They want it like, well, anyway.  They want it like they learned that technique somewhere.  Let's put it that way.  Holy Jesus.  Right.  You know what?  Oh, fight them.  For the people outside New York.  What am I shocking?  Is that?  For the people outside New York City, if you make it here, make sure you stop by B&H and  see how they run that joint.  Yeah, they really do.  Pretty amazing. 
[01:31:00]  So anyway, my Canon camera is working very well, and I'm reading the manual during breaks  and trying little options.  I mean, I'm having the proverbial ball on my new camera.  We see.  Some of those guys are fans of the show, too, believe it or not.  Yep.  Yeah.  Some of the Hasidics love the show.  Yes, I didn't have to wait.  It was a tremendous line.  I'm talking to the one guy.  I'm like, well, I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  We kind of promote you guys a lot.  They go, I can't do it.  I just wanted them to ring me up.  It's as low as it can go.  No, it wasn't a price issue, but I wouldn't even think of it.  All right, little old Jim.  Oh.  So last night. 
[01:31:30]  Instead of little Jimmy Norton, literal Jimmy Norton.  Literal Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  One of his many characters, Colin.  Last night, Obama and McCain at this Al Smith dinner.  I had no idea they were going to make jokes.  It was way better than.  Yeah, isn't it kind of weird?  It was way better than the debate.  Yeah, but it's still bizarre that suddenly in the middle of this heated thing where the  whole country's crisis, hey, we have to live this tradition of cracking a few jokes.  Yeah.  It's kind of strange.  They're bashing each other the day before, the day after, but then they take a little time  out.  But then they're following the roast format.  They're killing each other. 
[01:32:00]  Then at the end, they're saying unbelievable good things about each other.  It's bizarre.  Wait, the night before, you were basically saying he's a terrorist.  You're old.  Yeah.  You picked a C for your running mate.  Hey, America, we're not on the same page with you.  This is all over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a joke.  That's what I was thinking, Colin.  Weird, isn't it?  It's like one day Bush and Bin Laden just sitting next to each other goofing.  Hey.  Funny hat you got on.  Let me.  Yeah, we're not in their club.  They got a little secret club and they're playing us like fools. 
[01:32:30]  Here's McCain starting out with some Joe the Plumber material.  Oh, Jesus.  Events are moving fast in my campaign.  And yes, it's true that this morning I've dismissed my entire team of senior advisors.  All of their positions will now be held by a man named Joe the Plumber.  Joe the Plumber makes a joke.  Already.  Makes it into a joke.  That was quite a long setup for that one, boy.  My friends have been subjecting Joe to their vicious attack machine. 
[01:33:00]  His veracity has been questioned by Barack Obama's running mate, Joe the Sixth Term Senator.  He claims that this honest, hardworking, small businessman could not possibly have enough income to face a tax increase under the Obama plan.  What they don't know, what they don't know, is that Joe the Plumber recently signed a very lucrative contract with a wealthy couple to handle all the work on all seven of their houses. 
[01:33:30]  That's a good one.  He's making fun of himself, right?  Gotta.  Gotta give him.  You know, you gotta make fun of yourself.  That was pretty funny.  If you laugh and the world kind of laughs with you, you know.  That's right.  That's right.  Boys and boys philosophy.  That's Jimmy.  Laughter is the best medicine.  To bring it home for everyone.  Turns out Joe the Plumber is a fraud, huh?  Finding out he's not really a plumber.  What?  I hope he's Joe the Pedarest. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Or Joe the Chicken Hawk.  We were saying the same thing.  Bravo.  Joe the Pedarest Plumber.  That's actually a door of the Explorer.  Joe the Pedarest Plumber.  He was a...  Well, look at Obama in that.  I mean, he really looks like...  Who am I trying to...  A waiter?  You should be dancing on the steps with Shirley Temple.  Oh, God.  Just borrow it.  I'm trying, baby.  I'm trying.  It was at the Waldorf, so yeah.  He probably just borrowed a waiter's uniform.  I didn't realize everyone was dressing up. 
[01:34:30]  Could I have your uniform?  McCain, just all that skin tied up in that tie.  Just needs a satin pillow tie to the back of his head.  He just tied his neck skin into a bow tie and spray painted it white.  White's just not a good color for that guy.  He should stay away in the color of white.  Yeah.  Everything just blends together.  He looks like a sausage tied up with string in it.  McCain continues.  There's signs of hope, even in the most unexpected places, even in this room full of proud Manhattan 
[01:35:00]  Democrats.  Democrats, I can't shake that feeling that some people here are pulling for me.  I'm delighted to see you here tonight, Hillary.  All right.  Good one.  That's a good one.  Boy, is he nailing this.  He's nailing it.  That was a good joke.  I warmed up to the guy now.  I'm like, look at him. 
[01:35:30]  He's got some good jokes, yeah.  I wonder who wrote that.  Does he do any joke that says, you put Velcro on the ceiling?  Does it end like that?  Or three if you slice them thin enough?  It is a rose.  What the hell?  Yeah, why not?  An empty boat.  I go to Norton, who do you think wrote this?  He goes, Voss.  Voss.  That's right.  Hey, Congressman McCain.  No, he's not a congressman.  All right, whatever, but I'm just writing.  Bonnie, you told me he was. 
[01:36:00]  Odds are we know the guy that wrote this material.  Yeah.  Who was it?  With a lawyer under each arm.  They'd have all the oil.  Yeah, he gets desperate, throws a couple of his jokes in at the end.  They'd have all the oil.  And I'm dodging her.  I'm dodging her.  And then at the end, he just runs out.  Louie.  Louie.  Louie Bean.  Louie Beans.  Louie Beans.  Louie Plummer. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be a long, long night at MSNBC if I manage to pull this thing off.  It is good.  To our starters.  I understand that Keith Olbermann has ordered up his very own mission accomplished banner.  And they can hang that in whatever padded room has been reserved for him. 
[01:37:00]  Damn.  Nice, right?  I just hate the fact that douche Olbermann is getting like he's a force to be reckoned with  attention.  It sickens me.  Ugh.  Well, you're the one that wrote a whole chapter of him in the new book.  Oh, funny you should say that, Carl.  Pre-orders available on Amazon now for I Hate Your Guts.  Wow.  I Hate Your Guts is the name of your book.  Did no one try to make you change the title?  No, they loved it.  They loved it.  That's awesome.  That's a good one.  That was a good one.  Can we have a picture of Guts out in the front? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, and then me pointing at them like, yuck!  Hating them.  Hating them.  That was a taste of McCain.  You guys want to hear Obama?  Sure.  White people are crazy!  Does he just go into that whole act?  That would be a good one.  I got to say, I think McCain kicked his ass last night.  Yeah?  With the funny.  Yeah, I think Obama fell a little short.  You don't see how white people walk.  There's a lot of white people here tonight.  So Al Smith was an old politician, right?  Because governor.  Okay, because Obama's going to...  Is it Alfred E. Smith or... 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  He's going to refer to him.  Of course I'm right.  He's going to refer to him.  He's going to refer to him in this first joke.  Al Smith ran for president in 1928.  That's key as well.  28?  Yes.  He's very old.  Against Woody Wilson?  Who was he running against in 28?  Roosevelt?  It is an honor to be here with Al Smith.  I obviously never knew your great-grandfather, but from everything that Senator McCain has  told me...  That's a good one.  All right.  The two of them had a great time together before Prohibition, so... 
[01:38:30]  Why would you have a great time before Prohibition?  Because you were drinking, stupid.  Nah.  And then McCain should have shot back.  Like, yeah, yeah, I'm sure you met him, too.  You were serving the...  I'm a real racist.  Yeah, yeah, one of those things.  I'm sure he had a great time before the Emancipation Proclamation.  He would have said, shut up, cracker.  Yeah.  These crackers are hilarious.  In the last few weeks, John's been out on the campaign trail and asked the question,  who is Barack Obama? 
[01:39:00]  I have to admit, I was a little surprised by this question.  The answer is right there on my Facebook page.  But, look, I don't want to be coy about this.  We're a couple of weeks from an important election.  Americans have a big choice to make.  And if anybody feels like they don't know me by now, let me try to give you some answers.  Who is Barack Obama?  Contrary to the rumors that you've heard, I was not born in a manger.  I was...  I was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father, Jor-El, to save the planet Earth. 
[01:39:30]  Jor-El?  Oh, what a white nerd talking about comic book stuff.  Yeah.  He's already got Patton Oswalt's vote.  Come on.  Jor-El.  Many of you know that I got my name, Barack, from my father.  What you may not know is Barack is actually Swahili for Bat One.  That's a good joke.  That is good.  And I got my middle name from somebody who obviously didn't think I'd ever run for president. 
[01:40:00]  Great joke.  Damn.  These guys are on fire.  They're on fire.  Just put them in the comedy clubs.  What are they doing running for president?  They should have been running commercials for this all week.  Yeah.  No one saw this because it just showed up on some of the news channels in the middle of the night.  They didn't publicize this.  They should have pumped this up like you're going to get to see these guys to show.  Actually being human.  Like Norton shows at the Wilton.  That's right. 
[01:40:30]  The Wilbur.  Whatever.  Ah, the Wilton.  What is the Wilton?  In L.A.?  That's a theater.  It's silly.  Well, I'm not in L.A.  I'm doing a Viper Room in L.A.  Oh, God.  I know Boss had something to do with McCain's thing because he said, could I buy you one of  my houses?  Yeah.  And Barack's like, I'm not going to say I got a car.  Why would I say that?  Trust me.  It never doesn't work.  They promoted the debate like crazy for what?  For what reason?  The debate stunk and that thing was great. 
[01:41:00]  People would have watched this.  Those are great lines.  You could drop them off anywhere.  Boss punchline.  We had to put McCain in a rest area.  One more clip from Obama.  But I know Senator McCain agrees that some of the rumors out there are getting a bit crazy.  I mean, Rupert, the other day, Fox News actually accused me of fathering two African-American  children in wedlock.  Holy jeez. 
[01:41:30]  Huh?  Wow.  How about this Obama?  That's something.  How about it?  He's got my vote now.  These brothers better hope they, you better hope the brothers don't catch on to irony in  the next two weeks.  Thank you.  Look.  Look at that.  Oh.  By the way, John, I'm just curious, is Fox News included in the media?  Because I'm always hearing about this love.  Is Fox News what included in the media?  Because I'm always hearing about this love.  I don't get it. 
[01:42:00]  I'll explain it.  Because everyone's saying the media loves Obama.  And he's saying, oh, okay.  See, Fox News wouldn't because they're, you know.  He's right, though.  The one out of 50 networks.  Racist.  Crazy.  Oh, believe it.  I was watching.  I was on Fox last night.  Just taped one of my many appearances.  And they were showing Dreyfus and all these just fruity liberals.  The Dreyfus case.  Complaining.  Like, oh, Fox.  Dreyfus funds.  Like when they're interviewed on the red carpet, they all have to comment on Fox.  I know.  Shit.  You've had the media for so many.  You can't handle one network that I'm not a bunch of bleeding. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, they make me sick.  It is.  It is.  One network that is slanted really conservative.  Right.  Not a bunch of babies.  Now, going back to what Colin said, this was weird because the debate was two days ago  and they're killing each other, right?  Right.  At this thing last night, this is what McCain had to say about Obama.  I don't want it getting out of this room, but my opponent is an impressive fellow in  many ways.  Political opponents can have a little trouble seeing the best in each other, but I've had 
[01:43:00]  a few glimpses of this man at his best, and I admire his great skill, energy, and determination.  It's not for nothing that he's inspired so many folks in his own party and beyond.  Senator Obama talks about making history, and he's made quite a bit of it already.  There was a time when the mere invitation of an African-American citizen to dine at the  White House was taken as an outrage and an insult in many quarters. 
[01:43:30]  Today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time and good riddiness.  I can't wish my opponent luck, but I do wish him well.  What the?  Well, that's...  He should just run that as a campaign ad now.  Yeah.  Just have Obama run that.  He should run some of those zingers.  Are you allowed to use your jokes?  They should both run their jokes. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Shows like Colin was saying.  It's all crap in the end.  It also shows something else.  Humor is the great uniter.  Oh, Colin.  And you know what?  They say it's the best medicine.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I said.  I mean, I couldn't...  You know, I'm a good doctor.  You know, just heal it.  Obama also said...  Maybe if you weren't reading the manual, you would have heard me say that.  Did you?  Boo!  I was going to bring that up.  This is going great.  All the time.  I love it.  That was a great example of not listening. 
[01:44:30]  We do it all the time.  We don't listen.  There's nothing funnier to us, either.  It's just...  How many pages...  I've got to stop reading the manual.  How many pages in are you?  You could have read a nice book by now.  I'm, uh...  It's a nice book.  It's about his camera.  No one reads manuals.  What are you doing?  That's why...  Because I want to learn to use this camera.  He wants to know everything about it.  Yeah, well...  No.  Yes!  I'm taking penis shots, and I want to learn the best way to really make every object around  them look small.  It's just all about the angle.  Forced perspective.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's an angle thing. 
[01:45:00]  Opie's right.  You could have read a good book.  A good book.  I couldn't.  I was writing one.  Oh!  Hey, don't give us...  Touché!  Don't give us the Jesse the body answer.  We're not going to throw for it.  Oh, I...  That's right.  He did say that.  Someone's a fad.  Obama, in turn, had something nice to say about McCain, but because we're, like, left-leaning  over here, we're not going to play it.  Hey.  All right.  What?  I want to hear it.  I want to especially...  I don't want to hear more sincerity.  I can't take it.  To Senator McCain, we are in the midst of a tough battle right now, and American politics 
[01:45:30]  at the presidential level is always tough.  But, uh, I've said before, and I think it bears repeating, that there are very few of  us who have served this country with the same dedication, uh, and honor and distinction  as Senator McCain, and I'm glad to be sharing the stage with him tonight, as I am during  the course of this nomination.  Not as good as what McCain said about Obama.  Neither one of them is good.  I don't want to hear any more sincerity. 
[01:46:00]  That was, uh...  The jokes were good.  No, you know why?  Because McCain was able to throw that race thing in, saying, like, yeah, there was a time...  He would have thrown the other thing in.  He would have said this man was, you know, sitting there in their Hanoi Hilton for five  years.  Yeah, he could have been a little more detailed on why he, his service was so, uh, amazing.  You know, because, uh, McCain did bring up the fact that, you know...  But, I mean, who cares anymore about both of us?  What did McCain bring up that it was so great?  Hey, he's not a slave anymore.  There was a time that where an invite to the White House would never happen, and now that's 
[01:46:30]  only my house.  But he's not...  He's not talking.  Jesus.  Hey, Chris, uh, Chris M., you were asking Al Smith who he ran against?  This is, uh, Chris's instant feedback.  Got to read a word for it.  Al Smith ran against Herbert Hoover in 1928.  Oh.  Comma.  He lost.  Really, Chris?  Okay.  He lost.  Thanks for telling us that.  Thank you.  We know that part.  Would have changed the all in the family song.  That's about it.  Wow, that is brilliant. 
[01:47:00]  Ah, Colin.  Jimmy, don't look at me.  Go read your manual if you're not having fun.  What?  I was nodding.  I like the new zinger.  Read your manual for Jim.  I was nodding in silent enjoyment of that joke.  Well, it sure didn't look that way from here.  Well, then you were misreading me.  I was...  Well, oh, well.  Yes.  If Anthony's not going to do it as Jim President, I'm going to do a bad one.  Yes.  Colin Reagans.  What?  Well...  You know, laughter is the best medicine.  Can't you do Reagan as dice?  I just forgot that someone else said it.  Why can't you do Reagan as dice as Bobby? 
[01:47:30]  Yes.  So I'm standing in line...  Will, I'm standing in line at the bank.  And, Will, I got my tongue up this chick's...  And I say, well, you know, we're at the bank.  Whoa.  That's so funny.  Yes.  It's Ronald Dice Reagan. 
[01:48:00]  Hickory dickory dock.  This chick was...  My...  Oh.  Just, please.  I hate to put you...  Yes.  I hate to get a human jukebox out of you.  But can you do dice, given the Reagan debate?  The other guy, what you won't use is...  It's trickle-down economics.  Why don't you listen to me?  You give up a top.  It's going to trickle down at some point. 
[01:48:30]  You jackass.  What's the matter with you?  Hey, f*** off face.  I got a request.  Could you do the space shuttle one?  When Reagan had to talk to the family.  Hey, you know, these astronauts from the Challenger, you know, they reached up, they slipped the  surly bonds of Earth, and touched the face of God.  You hear me?  Hey, you know, they were here on Earth, and they're over there now. 
[01:49:00]  Now they're over there now.  You know, they were here alive in the spaceship, and then all of a sudden, I'm over here now  with God.  Slipping the surly bonds of Earth, and touching his face.  And God's like, get your stinking hands off of me.  And then, what was the chick's name?  The teacher.  That who?  What was she?  I want to be on the spaceship. 
[01:49:30]  Why don't you stay home?  Cook me breakfast, honey.  Krista.  Krista McCulloch.  McCulloch Culkin.  Whatever.  Ah, this is brilliant.  Oh, you could do, uh, you know, the, uh.  Hey, Gorbachev, take down this effing wall.  You hear me?  Oh, yeah.  You hear me?  Sit on your head. 
[01:50:00]  Midgets.  Oh.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, rocks.  I try to remember Reagan stuff now.  Yes.  Oh.  I don't recall.  The bombing, but that's just a quickie.  The bombing.  Yes.  Reagan had some good ones.  The bombing starts in five minutes.  Boy, that scared the hell out of the Rooshkies.  I think everything he did was calculated, though.  Like, that was just for them to go, oh, my goodness.  What did, what, comrade, did he just say? 
[01:50:30]  What was the five-minute bombing line?  It was, they were, uh, it was before a speech.  He was testing a mic, and it was live.  And he said, uh.  The same thing happened to Norton his first two years in comedy.  He was testing a mic line, and the bombing went on.  In five minutes.  He said, uh, we've outlawed the Soviet Union.  The bombing starts in five minutes.  Well, how about McCain?  Remember?  He did the same thing.  He's like, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.  I ran.  Bomb, bomb.  What a hack.  Did he really?  That's a real Annapolis, like, guy, cocky guy. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, I'm going to do a Beach Boys song.  Yeah, here we go.  Bomb, I ran.  Yeah, he was testing the mic, and he did bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.  He heard that on a morning zoo.  That was a song that was a hit.  Oh, that was huge back on the morning radio thing.  Oh, that was a hit.  Why wouldn't it be?  That's really a hack.  Maybe we can find the song.  He's right.  He goes, why wouldn't it be?  Yeah.  It's just the hackiest.  Kenny in New York.  What's up, Kenny?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to, it's a little late now, but I was talking about McCain's new career 
[01:51:30]  opening up for Jimmy Norton on November 14th and 15th at the World of the Theater.  Oh, wow.  Good thing you got that plug in.  Oh, what's the matter, Jimmy?  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Is it really bad?  He's doing, he's helping you out.  I feel like I'm in gut punch.  But he's helping you out.  No, because he got the dates wrong.  Oh, he did.  Come on.  Oh, God.  It's around there.  Don't call me.  That's close to your bedtime.  Oh, don't turn on me.  It's around there, isn't it?  It's close enough.  What difference is making people show up?  It's around there.  He's right.  I'm sorry.  He'll probably be there.  No, he's right.  They'll just think Wilbur Theater, Boston, sometime in November. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  That's all.  Hey, here's a fall.  Beautiful.  Here's Bomb Iran, by the way.  Oh.  Told you.  You really did.  I know.  It's crap.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb Iran.  It's relevant today, Kitty.  Make a stand.  Until they talk about the Ayatollah.  Our country's got a feeling really in the ceiling.  Bomb Iran.  Bomb.  Bomb.  Bomb.  Bomb.  Bomb.  Here we go.  Went to a mosque.  Gonna throw some rocks. 
[01:52:30]  Tell the Ayatollah gonna put you in a box.  Bomb Iran.  Mosque and rocks?  Yeah.  I don't want to do a mosque.  He's pushing it.  Oh, come on.  That's not bad.  Yeah.  Mosque, rocks?  Doesn't rhyme.  No, it's free verse.  Okay.  All right.  I'll give him one.  Colin's doing the dance.  Getting pretty hot.  Time to turn Iran into a parking lot.  Ah, they all turn it into a parking lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What old week?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  This song says how I feel.  Yeah, man.  Bomb Iran.  You're just like me.  Yeah.  You're like me.  You want to keep hostages?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  So this is what McCain was singing.  So basically we're saying McCain listened to his morning zoo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Double over from that song. 
[01:53:30]  I thought it was great.  And started singing it to get his lamp.  You guys are missing the bombing.  The bombing's going on.  Oh.  Yeah.  There we go.  The hostages.  Bring them back alive.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  Sucks.  It's like a Beach Boys song. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Right.  We get it.  How long does this go on?  Endless.  30 more seconds.  Take a stand, man.  Why do I smell scorch somewhere in this thing?  I guarantee.  Bomb Iran.  Still playing it now.  Yeah.  Bomb Iran.  Yeah.  That was Bomb Iran.  We're going to be playing that every hour on the hour.  So stay tuned.  It's good, but it's no Back to Brooklyn. 
[01:54:30]  You know.  Oh.  Oh, sorry, Colin.  Oh, Colin.  That was actually a good tune.  You made our list of our favorite novelty songs, though.  Oh.  Novelty songs.  We're playing them today over at Sears.  Yeah.  We could even play a couple after the break because Colin's here.  Hey.  Something has to be acknowledged.  No, it doesn't.  It's about you, Ant.  So, of course it does.  Yeah, it does.  No, it doesn't.  People are amazed that you knew the Reagan quote off the top of your head.  The space shuttle Reagan quote. 
[01:55:00]  But you know what the best thing about.  I knew it had something about kissing something up there.  You know what the best thing about doing the Reagan impression is.  I'll let you know a little secret.  The fact that you can mumble and stutter until you remember.  You don't have.  Because I didn't know it right off the bat.  And I knew.  Yeah.  So, you could just kind of.  You still pull it out of thin air.  Hey, thank you.  No one has talked about Reagan in 10 years and you had that.  That was amazing.  You had that.  I'll be honest.  I'll man up to it.  That actually brought a tear to my eye when he gave that little speech. 
[01:55:30]  It was very touching.  He was really good at doing things like that.  That's why they called him the great communicator.  Yes.  He knew how to talk.  Yes.  And he also got things through, I think, a Democratic congress and center.  Slipped the surly buns of her chest.  Didn't she?  Nancy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the other day, you mean?  Touch the face of the dumpster.  Oh, she banged into a dumpster the other day?  No.  No, they like it. 
[01:56:00]  We see an M-numble.  They're big fans of breast cancer college.  They're huge fans of it.  Oh, these two, yeah.  They're huge fans of it.  But M-n-n-t.  No, no.  We hate it, but we try to bring attention to it.  There you go.  Oh.  For the good.  That's right.  For good.  You raise awareness?  Yes.  I'm mocking the unfortunate victims of it?  Laughter is the best medicine.  I heard that.  I heard that somewhere.  Yeah, I know.  I feel like a doctor.  That's a good one, the kind of doctor in medicine.  Oh, good gravy. 
[01:56:30]  South Park did a breast cancer thing on the last South Park?  Good.  Yeah, one of the female students went to just educate about breast cancer,  and Eric Cartman thought it was funny that there were killer boobies out there.  Oh, wow.  The whole episode revolved around about breast cancer, pretty much.  Look what it says.  It was right before a rich voice set.  Ah.  Well, that was in reference to the bombing starts in five minutes.  Oh, I thought it was the, like.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Comedy Central was before South Park came.  War somehow plans to work his half hour in there. 
[01:57:00]  The bombing starts right now, ladies and gentlemen, to the stage rich voice.  You think Matt and Trey are just trying to get fired by it at this point?  Seems like it.  You think they're like, oh, my God.  We have another five years in this contract.  They're untouchable.  Who want out now?  They're untouchable until that, what, Chocolate News or whatever the hell.  Right.  Yeah.  Where black people do racial comedy that white people can't do.  Did you guys see it? 
[01:57:30]  Linda Stassi gave it three out of four stars.  She was saying how smart it is.  If you miss Chappelle's...  I don't know.  I haven't seen it, but...  I love Linda.  She's great.  Every time I read her, I think of Norton, and I laugh to myself.  The dead hand.  How mad...  What dead hand?  Because she does a pose where she's got her head on her hand, like she's leaning on her  hand, and Jimmy insists her hand just looks dead in the picture.  It's a severed cadaver hand that she's leaning her ugly face on.  And you can tell that from a half inch by half inch black and white in a newspaper.  But the way she describes always with her friends. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  She's gut-busting on the couch.  Oh, could you imagine the fun?  I just imagine the appetizer treats they must have at this event.  I want to be there just to have the fun that they must be having.  A bunch of pigs swapping jokes.  She's just horrible.  She's a horrible critic.  Her opinion stinks.  Well, she doubles over with laughter.  Yeah, strapping the seatbelt one time.  We get it.  All black comedies are smart.  We get it, you guilty up-west side bitch.  She goes strapping the seatbelt.  Oh, yeah.  She did say that. 
[01:58:30]  Gritman almost fell off the couch.  She's just awful.  Is she drinking?  That's what's great about her.  In the middle of New York City.  You think that show's going to be good, though?  Yeah, I do.  No.  Honestly, I'm telling you, David Allen Greer has chops like nobody else.  He can do characters.  I swear to God.  Are you kidding?  You sound like you're being sarcastic without the sarcasm.  David Allen Greer has chops like nobody else.  Hey, guys, give it a chance.  I'd like to spit on you from here.  I have no interest in ever talking to that guy.  Why?  He's all right. 
[01:59:00]  Mark my words.  That show's going to be funny.  You don't like him or he does nothing for me?  I'm going on regular.  I'm not a big fan of him.  But his characters are great.  Mark my words.  I'm going on record.  Like what?  Like who?  Like whatever the show is.  I guarantee it's going to be good.  I bet they do a bit where they go back to slavery days, but they're still all jivey and hip-hoppy  and really showing whitey what it is.  That's cutting edge.  Is that one of the bits?  No, but I would just assume that happens.  Well, you know what happens when you assume? 
[01:59:30]  It's the best medicine?  No.  Wait, how did that go?  It's like we make an ass out of us.  It doesn't matter.  We'll figure it out.  We'll fix it in post.  Hey, Carmen gave a breast cancer awareness speech full of puns.  It was great.  Can we try to find that?  Bobby D and Brockton.  And Chocolate News was on last night?  Chocolate News.  This person is saying it sucked.  Hated it.  Yeah.  Was it on?  Chocolate News?  Was it David Duke?  I'm sure it was.  I didn't watch it, but I'm sure it was on already. 
[02:00:00]  No one watched.  We're in radio.  Let's be honest.  As much as I love South Park without hearing this bit, as none of us have seen Chocolate  News, making breast cancer is not edgy either.  Go on.  Let's play it.  Okay.  We've got to find it still, Colin.  Jesus.  Find it.  Stop giving away our tricks.  That's half of mine and Jimmy's repertoire.  No, but I'm saying that they're doing.  Retards.  No one's disagreeing with you.  1983 shoes.  Hey. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, God.  Wow.  The three black stripes down the side.  Yeah.  They're coming back, right?  Shell tops have made two comebacks since then, by the way.  What are those?  None of them are now, unfortunately, but 1990.  Shell tops Adidas?  Yeah.  It's all run DMC shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're coming back.  Sure they are.  Quick break.  Colin Quinn at Caroline's this weekend.  Woo-hoo!  2-1-2-7-4-1-100.  Wow.  We're almost done.  That's crazy.  No way.  Look at the clock. 
[02:01:00]  Someone moved it.  I swear to God, I thought we had another hour.  That usually means we had a good show.  That, uh...  When it flies by like that.  Did Doc set the clocks?  Uh, because then I'm late for school.  I've got on my skateboard.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, uh, down and dirty tonight.  HBO Midnight, Jimmy.  I forgot about that.  How are you forgetting about your own show?  Because my...  I found out yesterday that my book is available now on Amazon pre-sale.  It's actually cheaper on Amazon.  It's called I Hate Your Guts, but I attack a lot of people in this book. 
[02:01:30]  Like who?  Can you throw out some names there?  Just thinking...  Hillary Clinton.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Al Sharpton.  Al Roker.  Al Roker gets brutalized.  Good, good.  Uh, Jesse Jackson.  Uh, Heather Mills.  In the book, in the book.  Yeah.  Attack a lot of people.  It felt very good.  Steve Martin.  Um, so whatever.  You know, I hope people dig it.  Um, Down and Dirty, I forgot about that.  Yeah, on HBO.  Midnight.  Let's go.  It's either Bill Burr or Patrice's episode, by the way.  I don't remember which one it is.  Either one.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  You're gonna do great.  Uh, Amy, Dumb Girl, Connecticut.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  What's up, Amy?  Uh, Jimmy, assume me and make an ass out of you and me.  Wait.  Oh, I'm like, hold on, hold on, hold on.  No, I think that's wrong.  Because when I said, like, something happens when you assume, you know what happens when  you assume.  Make an ass out of you and me.  That doesn't make sense.  Why would, what do you mean?  Like how it's spelled.  No, no, no, no.  Nah, it was so many odd couples.  It was like when you assume, it's like you're making like a, me is an ass or something? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, an ass out of you and me.  No, no, no.  There's no why in it.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense?  No, you're saying a you and me and it's like there's too many letters.  A-S-S-U-M-E.  Right, exactly.  That's what, exactly.  You're saying like there's an ass and then there's two other, out of you and me.  It's too many letters.  When you, you know where I learned that my freshman year of high school and my all-girl  Catholic girl school.  Wait, what is she talking about? 
[02:03:00]  When you assume what happens to you.  I don't get it is what it is.  What happens, Amy, when you assume something?  When you assume you make an ass out of yourself.  No.  See, that's exactly, it's too.  Wait, you're making an ass out of yourself.  Wait, I'm really confused.  You're making an ass out of the person you're talking to and yourself.  Right, we certainly know what that feels like.  So, an assumption is, like when you make assumptions, you're making like, what do you mean?  I don't understand what you're saying at all. 
[02:03:30]  You're wrong.  I'm wrong?  Yeah.  Wait, what did you say originally?  I said when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.  But why would that make an ass?  You're just making an assumption.  I don't understand why you're making an ass out of you and me.  Like, what's wrong with assuming?  Yeah.  Why would it make an ass out of me?  I don't think there's anything wrong.  But I heard you say, you know, you make an ass out of somebody.  So, I just wanted to explain what people say.  But if it makes an ass out of me and you, I don't get it. 
[02:04:00]  I don't know.  That's just what people say.  If you assume it makes an ass out of me and you?  Pretty much.  That's what it means.  But how does that work out phonetically?  I have no idea.  So, wait.  So, who's making an ass out of themselves?  Who's the ass?  I'm confused.  Yeah.  Amy?  The ass is the person who's assuming.  Oh, not?  Okay.  I would have thought it was the person giving the 40-minute explanation for what was done  as a goof an hour ago.  But you're saying that it's like both parties are being made asses out of? 
[02:04:30]  I'm sorry?  Yes.  You're saying both parties are being made asses out of?  I didn't hear you.  Go through that again, please, the explanation.  Yeah.  When you assume.  Mm-hmm.  We got that.  You make an ass.  Yeah.  Out of you and me.  Okay.  Assume starts with ASS.  Does that make sense?  But what's the you for?  There's no Y in that.  There's a, yeah.  Or an O. 
[02:05:00]  The letter U.  Are you driving right now?  Yeah.  Help your rear end of a gas truck.  Oh.  Do you listen to the show?  I'm trying to help you out, man.  I know.  I know.  I just didn't get it.  I think you're messing with me.  No.  I was just helping you because you didn't know.  Like, you said I make an ass out of something.  You should die like Olivier's brother in the marathon, man.  What did you say?  Whatever.  Amy, congratulations on being a homecoming queen, by the way. 
[02:05:30]  I'm glad I have the opportunity to congratulate you.  That's, that's quite an accomplishment for someone like yourself.  I don't know if they had that at my school.  Yeah.  They didn't let us have it.  Tonight, by the way, is myself, it's Joe DeRosa, Russ Maneeve, and Ari Shafir, and  of course, Patrice O'Neill.  Tonight's Patrice's episode.  You got Russ on the show, too?  I mean, yes.  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  Yes?  I wanted to tell you, when I lived by myself in the apartment, I left the TV on also because 
[02:06:00]  I didn't want it to be quiet.  Oh, how about that?  God bless you, dear.  All right.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Let's say hi to Grant in Pennsylvania.  I hate the fact that she now thinks she had a great call.  That's the beauty of her.  She'll call again.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Grant.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Hey.  Grant.  Grant.  Hello.  Yeah.  Graham like Graham crackers.  Oh, Graham.  What's up, Graham?  Apostrophe crackers.  What's going on?  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Amy's got that saying right. 
[02:06:30]  What saying?  The saying, assume makes an ass out of you and me.  I don't get it.  He's got it because you got A-S-S, and then you know how people have on their vanity place  where they can't spell out the whole word?  Right.  Right.  Well, it's a text message.  Makes an ass out of you, Amy.  There's no and in there, though.  It's too long.  And you spell U-Y-O-U.  No, instead of and, you just say M-E. 
[02:07:00]  See, me is too short.  What do you mean?  You make an ass out of U-M-E.  U-M-E.  So.  U-M-E.  What is U-M-E?  That's not a word?  It doesn't make sense.  What does U-M-E spell?  It doesn't spell anything, but it sounds kind of like and.  Instead of, you know, how some people say that whole word.  Graham, start over.  All right.  When you assume, you make an ass out of U-M-E.  Well, where's out of in the word assume?  Yeah, this makes no sense. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Instead of saying, you know.  Yeah, buddy.  Oh, no.  That's a saying, though.  That's a saying.  It might not be.  It might make a whole lot of sense, but that's a little saying.  Sorry, so if you make an assumption, if they say, if you assume, you're basically like  all parties involved are being asses?  Yeah.  How does that look like a license plate, vanity plate?  Huh.  Well, no, what I'm saying is just how they shorten things on a vanity plate.  I've never seen it.  Ever. 
[02:08:00]  Vanity plate?  You've never saw a vanity plate that said assume.  Why do we even, why do we even try doing smart radio?  It's like instead of saying, instead of saying eight, eight, A-T-E, somebody will put just  the number eight.  Well, maybe you'll have to have a certain amount of numbers in the license plate.  Wait a minute.  When I say A-T-E, that's, that means eight?  A-T-E.  Meaning the number eight?  No, it's E-I-G-H-T, dude.  What are you talking about?  All right.  No, the letter eight.  Let's say hi to Malik.  Well, Graham, apostrophe. 
[02:08:30]  I was so happy you messed that up.  Yeah.  Malik in New York.  It still had some juice to it.  I didn't catch it.  Malik, go ahead.  Yes, sir.  Sorry.  Yeah, what's good, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, yo, listen.  Oh, how are you going to find bobblehead cartoons, South Park funny, but not David Allen Greer,  and he gave you characters on Living Color, like the two gay guys he did with Tommy Davidson,  Mr. McAtee?  Next, you're going to be telling me Colin was funny and who was the man. 
[02:09:00]  Colin defended the guy.  He says he does great characters.  That was uncalled for.  I'm sorry.  I did a fine performance as Frankie Flattery and who was the man.  All right, Malik.  You know what?  I don't think David Allen Greer was the funny one in Living Color.  Are you a big fan of David Allen Greer?  It was him and Damon, not Tommy Wade.  It's Davidson, by the way.  David Allen Greer is very funny.  No, I was never a fan.  I didn't think he was like the real standout on Living Color.  My cousin's skating.  In Living Color. 
[02:09:30]  That's your cousin?  Yeah.  Sarah Hughes.  That's your cousin?  Yep.  We've got a lot of talent in my family.  Why is she skating today?  I don't know.  I'll have to ask her.  Oh, no.  Here comes Jill with a bat.  I think they just opened the rink or something.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, look at that.  They did.  Here's the breast cancer thing from South Park.  Down in Roxanne.  Students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death in women.  A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day.  I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer. 
[02:10:00]  Jesus.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime.  And breast cancer is the most common...  She said it again.  Is there a problem?  Because breast cancer isn't funny.  Breast cancer is killing people.  Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?  Eric, for the love of Jesus.  This is a serious issue, Eric.  What you're doing is very offensive.  Me?  You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. 
[02:10:30]  Wendy says boobs can kill people.  God!  Gonna get you.  Gonna get you, Wendy.  I don't want to get killed by boobs.  Will somebody do something?  Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything.  Eric, stop being offensive.  I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.  No, you aren't.  Wendy, you need to calm down.  You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!  Hey, we need that clip.  I'm on fire today. 
[02:11:00]  Let's get that in the old replay.  Wow, who left the word in?  Who was that?  Iraq?  Iraq.  We can't do that one?  No.  Maybe.  Sometimes you can, I think.  Maybe.  Iraq, did you play that first?  Oh, did that might make...  Did you play the right one?  Yeah, I played the right one.  Ooh, Iraq.  Ooh, Iraq.  Challenging observation, Randall.  Good for you, Iraq.  Good for you.  Don't take note for nobody. 
[02:11:30]  Wait, let me see.  Maybe...  You gonna stand for that?  What are you gonna take?  Oh, I didn't play the right one.  Oh!  Fuck, man.  I had a warm night.  He's tired.  Where was the...  Oh!  Where was the...  Was it near the end?  I don't remember.  That's fine.  Yeah.  We get it.  We get it?  Yeah.  We get it.  We gotta leave soon.  We gotta leave right now.  That's what we do.  Now.  Now.  Now.  All right, Colin.  Now. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Will you be joining us, Colin?  I hate when Colin leaves.  I will stay, but not because I want to.  Sinatra on The Tonight Show or something.  I always wanna leave.  He's like the guy like...  All right, I'm staying.  Dean Martin.  Always had to leave.  Well, you guys do five hours of radio.  Sorry, Johnny.  I gotta go.  It's like, where are you going?  Because guess what?  I'll speak for every comedian except for you guys.  All of us resent doing the other show.  It's five hours of radio for no money, so everybody gets a little titty.  I understand.  Yeah, but you get the plugs in.  I understand.  You got a few more people in the seats.  I get it. 
[02:12:30]  Over on the...  But we do get aggravated by it.  As soon as XM's side, we got Jason Ritter coming in at 945.  You want five bucks?  Yeah.  Plus your five bucks.  Yeah.  Five bucks would help.  Collins and Caroline.  Five bucks would help.  And Down and Dirty Tonight at Midnight.  And Amazon.com for my book, Pre-Sale.  Hey, Jim, can you be a little less enthusiastic?  Ha!  Come on.  I'll down sell.  I know, but I was being ironic.  You assumed.  You made an answer. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, I mean...  I like to wrap it all up.  How fantastic is it?  We were getting legitimate explanations.  Thank you guys very much.  Yes.  Yes.  Great.  Can I say, though, for years, I didn't understand that it was you make an asset of U-M-E.  I thought it was you make an asset of U-M-E.  Yeah.  So I actually did get help.  No.  You're completely wrong.  Nobody says U-M-E.  You make an asset of U-M-E.  No, U-M-E.  Oh, is that right?  Time, yes.  All right.  I thought so.  But I thought you asked that girl to back into a gas truck.  You don't realize that would explode and kill her. 
[02:13:30]  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  I should have said milk truck.  Would have kept it a little more fun.  That she gets milk all over her.  Oh, my God.  What am I?  A piece of cereal?  You're right.  My rag.  My birthday.  Milk truck.  Hey, for the folks in the Boston area, too, Catch a Rising Star, Patrice O'Neal, is there.  Providence, actually.  Yeah.  Stay home and watch Down and Dirty.  You can see him tonight for free.  Bastard.  That's not nice, Jimmy.  Patrice O'Neal at Catch a Rising Star in Providence, as well.  All right, guys.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you soon. 
[02:14:00]  This is an emergency broadcast.  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.  Opie and Antony.  Cat Line movie.  The fuel on the outdoors.  Theiele father in mud.  The engine.  The Truman force you are about to hear coming from you.  Thedrum on the�vote.  The Davjal.

[02:16:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:17:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:17:30]  We'll be right back.  What do you think I'm yelling TGI Friday for?  I saw the people.  Fridays used to be the day where we would sneak out early because it's Friday.  We gave them enough radio for the week, blah, blah, blah.  But now we can't.  Can't let the crowd down. 
[02:18:00]  Now we have to stay all the way to 11.  Where's my five dollars?  Oh, you want the five dollars still?  He told me he's going to give me five dollars.  After the show.  If I gave it to you now, you could leave and then I'd be out five bucks.  He's got a good point.  He learned that in Mastic.  I just like when I references Long Island.  With the engines.  What Long Island town do you want to reference right now and why?  Bellport for no reason.  Bellport for no reason.  Bellport.  Confused with Belmore. 
[02:18:30]  He just makes it so.  Elmont.  Spionk.  Spionk.  Spionk.  That's one of those obscure Long Island.  Quog.  I only learned about it when I started doing radio for BAB.  This is Centiport.  Aquapog.  Oh, it's from Centiport.  But I'm not a climber.  But I told you I shot Crocodile Dundee 2 in Centiport.  Oh.  They had a big mansion there.  I had one line in Crocodile Dundee 2.  I'll tell you that story, of course, about how I went to them. 
[02:19:00]  One line is almost a glorified extra.  And I rewrote the whole script.  It was me as the co-lead with Paul Hogan in the hand.  Did you rather say, look, this is what really needs to be done?  They should have listened to you, though.  Did they find it funny?  Luckily, they were Australian.  They said they didn't fire me and ban me from my business.  But it didn't work out the way they wanted.  No.  They probably would have been better off with me as the guide that I was in my version that drove Paul Hogan around.  That's funny. 
[02:19:30]  I bet my version was horrible.  I wish I had a copy of it.  Hey, Anthony was talking about a show called Life on Mars.  Yes.  For the newbies listening in, it's basically a show where a cop gets into a little accident there.  He gets hit by a car.  And he goes from 2008 to 1973.  He's still a cop because the cops, I guess, assume that he's from another precinct.  Right.  Transferred in.  Right.  And, you know, he's got to deal with trying to figure out where he is and why.  Why he's back in 1973. 
[02:20:00]  He's got to get back to his chick back in 2008 because I believe she was ready to be murdered,  if not already murdered at the time that that happened.  Lisa Bonet.  Yes, Lisa Bonet.  And he's got to work with these cops from 1973 New York City, which was, you know, pretty  dirty and gruff.  And you used the word gritty.  You know, gritty.  Gritty.  Gritty.  Good.  Good.  Gritty.  Good.  Good.  And that's what the show is pretty much based on.  The thing that bugs me about it, I really want to like the show because I like any kind 
[02:20:30]  of time travel type shows, movies, whatever.  I find them intriguing.  I think there's a lot of material there you could do.  But they have to throw in these fucking references to the early 70s in a way no one would.  No one walked around then and talked like this and referenced the time you're in constantly.  Right.  They do that because they assume, and I bet correctly, that the viewers of regular network 
[02:21:00]  television, because it's on ABC, are idiots, complete morons.  So they just keep spoon feeding them the fact that, remember now, remember people, he's  from 2008, but he's back in 73.  So we'll keep throwing these 73 references at you to remind you.  I don't need to be reminded.  And I know what the show's about.  I get the plot, just fucking do the show, keep it.  I think a show like this would be great on HBO.  I mean, the characters, Michael Imperioli is really good at his characters. 
[02:21:30]  It's greasy haired, got one of those good 70s stash and sideburns going.  You know what's so funny?  He's describing himself right now.  Yes.  I got the 70s stash and the greasy hair.  I do need a haircut.  It's tough to shower before you come in.  He looks like Michael Imperioli in the 70s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's me.  Anthony looks like every 70s cop and every 70s junkie.  Oh, what a treat that would be, just to bust some head, shake downs. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, I know.  I feel the same.  Maybe I could do that.  I took the police test.  I got a 96.  They never called me.  Oh.  You're kidding, really?  I had a Port Authority police test.  It wasn't good enough?  Apparently not.  Maybe you're too old at this point.  You know who got a lower grade and got in?  Mm-hmm.  Who?  I bet.  Big A?  No.  Oh, yeah.  The blacks.  Imagine if Big A was a cop.  Big N.  You know how the world works. 
[02:22:30]  Big N.  You know how the world works, Colin.  No, I think it was also something that happened in between, too, where it was like...  Oh, drug bust.  In those days, they changed...  Yeah, I think there was some paperwork.  Oh, Jesus.  So, uh...  We got the 70s references from Life on Mars.  Oh, now you tell me if this is fucking overkill.  They've done two episodes.  That's it.  Two episodes, and there are how many references?  We got about nine or ten.  Nine fucking references in two episodes?  Well, let's hear them first.  Maybe one reference per episode that isn't a ham-handed, hey, look at my mood ring. 
[02:23:00]  That's kind of a fucking thing, you know?  Let's just get...  I still...  I'm holding out that it's done in tongue-in-cheek.  It isn't.  It isn't.  If it was, I might be able to appreciate that a little more, but it's not.  Here's the first one.  This is not my car.  So you ain't Sam Tyler?  I am.  This is not my car. 
[02:23:30]  I was driving a...  A Jeep.  You were driving a military vehicle?  I need my cell.  You need to sell what?  No.  I just...  Well, that first one's...  I saw that episode.  That was it when he first arrived.  Right, right.  And that's a blatant rip-off of Back to the Future, where Marty McFly goes into the diner,  and they say he's wearing a life preserver because he's wearing a down coat, and he says he wants a Pepsi-free.  And the guy goes, no, you got to pay for it. 
[02:24:00]  He goes, all right, well, give me a tab.  He goes, you can't have a tab.  You got to buy some.  See, that's kind of that same play on Werthing.  Only that one was actually clever.  Right.  It was all connected.  But the 70s reference wasn't like...  No, no, that wasn't that bad.  That wasn't that bad.  We're kind of gliding into it here.  Don't let him off the hook, because he's jumping to the mic to try to defend why he...  Yes, sir.  Sam brought up a great point, that nobody would say, I need my Jeep.  They would say, like, I need my car.  I need my car.  Like, where's my car?  You might say, I don't...  Where's my cell? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I would say that.  He wouldn't just say it to a stranger.  And no one would say a military vehicle in 1973 if you said Jeep.  Here's the phony part, is that the responses were too obvious.  Like, him saying...  Who's on second?  Yeah.  Who's on first?  You need a military vehicle?  He would just say, what do you mean?  A Jeep.  A Jeep.  The most unrealistic part of the whole thing was when he said, Sam brought up a good point,  and we all listened with bated breath.  Or, you know...  And my cell.  I need my cell.  Gotta sell what?  We get it.  Sell?  You're gonna sell what? 
[02:25:00]  You don't know what a cell phone is.  It's a cell phone.  Why would you sell your phone?  Don't you have money for heroin, which is big these days?  That's about the dollars.  Yes.  A dollars, Texas.  What do you need money for?  The Godfather 2?  Which is coming out next year?  That's exactly it.  Cuntface fucks.  I, uh...  All right.  That was not that bad.  I'll even agree.  That wasn't that bad.  I'm sitting there.  I saw that episode right when he landed.  It was a little pushy.  Let's go with the next one.  This is my office.  Wait, right there.  Bullshit.  Right here. 
[02:25:30]  This is my desk.  Hey, would you rather live in 2008?  Hold on.  How many of you see these people arguing?  Oh, dude.  What a shirt.  Actually, watching this, it wants me to go back to, like, 1940.  It's like, Colin, it's Maury Povich, obviously.  1840.  What Long Island town do you think they're from?  I swear to God, Maury.  They're probably from the Danch, I would think.  The Danch.  I swear to God, Maury.  The Danch, motherfucker.  Go to Danch.  Bentwood.  I'm saying it could be Bentwood or it could be, you know, Newcastle, someplace like that. 
[02:26:00]  Wheatley Heights.  Doesn't that sound like a nice place?  Oof.  Watch it.  Wheatley Heights.  I'm going to go with the wine dance.  All right.  The Danch.  Let's get back to this.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is my desk.  Here.  So where's my desk?  Huh?  Where's my desk?  Chair.  My computer.  Your computer?  Like how?  2001, a space odyssey?  That's the problem.  It's like we got us a regular space. 
[02:26:30]  Say.  Say.  I thought that was nice.  Say.  Suddenly laced in there.  Subtly laced in.  It was just like Norton's joke about Godfather 2.  It's the exact same.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  The problem is the shitty writing in the responses.  It's terrible.  Oh.  Come on.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Can I just say one thing?  Yes.  The acting is horrendous.  We just listen to it.  The dialogue.  And then this genius goes, the problem is the shitty writing and the responses.  Right.  That's what we're here mocking.  No, no, no, no.  Honey, no.  The shitty writing in the responses. 
[02:27:00]  It's the sound quality.  Hold on.  Somebody needs to take the cotton out of their ears and put it in their mouth.  Oh.  I was saying the response is not necessarily.  He's not selling it.  Come on.  Don't let them all talk.  I do what I beg of you.  I'm right.  Uh-oh.  The shitty writing in the responses is terrible.  It's the obviousness of the responses, which are not so 70s.  It's just, you need a Jeep?  It's terrible.  Yeah.  It's pushing, and they're so noticeable and so distracting to watching the show. 
[02:27:30]  But I was expecting it to be things that only reference the 70s.  That's just fucking terrible writing.  Well, they'll keep going.  All right.  We're getting there.  Keep going.  We're getting there.  Like how?  Like how?  Which came out a few years ago?  In 2001, a space odyssey?  Who the fuck talks like that?  No one.  Just like the Godfather joke, though.  That's exactly what he did.  It really is.  Annie, get your talk of the grieving parents kid on.  You found a missing twirl.  A twirl?  A girl. 
[02:28:00]  A broad, a chick, a dame, a lass.  Oh, of course.  That wasn't that bad.  What clip?  Why don't you get the opening music?  All right.  What the fuck did you guys get?  Who the hell said twirl?  We're almost four.  Yeah, a twirl.  We're almost four clips in and still not really proving Anne's point.  No, no.  It's annoying.  Because he had to explain other 70s references to ladies.  Chick, a dame?  That's like 40s.  A chick, a lass.  Nothing beats a dame, a dame, a dame.  One clip. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Don't worry.  So far, the machinist is 0 for 3.  You're looking more and more like Christian Bell is what he's saying there.  I'm not gaining or losing weight.  I'm that bad.  That's a good job, Christian.  Lamb lifted a few prints off a shoe.  They've been sent downtown.  You should hear back in a couple of weeks or so if there's a match.  A couple of weeks?  Yeah.  It's amazing what they can do these days. 
[02:29:00]  See, that I don't buy.  That's a ham-handed fucking bullshit way of doing that.  It's amazing what they can do these days.  A couple of weeks?  Yeah.  What, in the old days it took a couple of years?  This is just a, these are reminders that when you hear a line like that, you go, oh, right,  they're in 73.  It's annoying.  The way that would have been okay is if he was like a couple of weeks and the other guy  was like, yeah.  Yeah.  Or just didn't, they acknowledge every little thing that he is a little confused about. 
[02:29:30]  It's amazing what they do here in 1973 as opposed to 2008, let's say.  They immediately pick up on every fucking thing that they're supposed to pick up on.  Thank you, Jim.  That's exactly what I meant.  Even stuff that isn't the Jeep.  A Jeep?  A military vehicle?  Military vehicle?  Why, that's impossible.  What is a string of paloponies?  Mr. Faber-sham.  Fucking.  I think you guys are missing the big point. 
[02:30:00]  What?  I'd like to read you something.  Go ahead, Carl.  Well, the economy is in a crisis, war is destroying us, and there is discord among the  races.  That was written in 1871 in Austria.  Wow.  Isn't that amazing?  1871 in Austria.  Well, thank God someone came along and fixed that.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Go to the clip.  That's what I like to say.  All right.  Here's the next clip.  Dow's down 200, but rallying back. 
[02:30:30]  Now we're rallying.  So fucking Dow is down 200.  Let me tell you guys something.  That was in Roman times.  They had a stock market.  How you doing, my friend?  What part of my subconscious do you hail from?  Poughkeepsie.  What's your poison?  Just give me a Diet Coke.  Diet Coke?  Uh, scotch.  Make it a double, will you?  Diet Coke.  Now that would be something, huh?  See?  What, what, what?  Diet Coke?  Yeah, give me a scotch.  All right. 
[02:31:00]  Diet Coke.  Now that would be something.  You must be from the future.  This show fucking sucks.  Why'd you sit through this?  Because I told you I want to like.  I agree.  That's the first episode.  I wanted to like it.  I want to like the premise.  I like the idea of somebody being knocked back in time 35 years and having to deal with  shit like that.  Oh, I agree.  But it's not that stupid fucking.  You're just waiting for the next Back to the Future movie.  Yes!  Let's do some scene study.  You say. 
[02:31:30]  Uh, all right.  I'll say.  What do you want?  You do Diet Coke.  All right.  Uh, what do you want?  Uh, Diet Coke.  Come on.  What do you want?  Diet Coke.  That's how that happens.  A Coke that is not as many calories?  They've not invented that, have they?  That'll be the day.  You know who needs to be on this show?  Diet Coke, Louis Binge.  Yeah.  He died of AIDS.  The Diet Chocolate?  Don't make us play the spot so people get it.  God damn, is that awful. 
[02:32:00]  CW from Scranton.  I like the 70s cars.  Sideburns, clothes.  Don't remind you.  Exactly.  The outfits.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm with you, Ant.  They've done a great job.  Who watches TV?  What do you want to do about the outfits?  They've done a good job with the cars, although the cars are a little too well kept.  Like, as I'm watching, these are muscle cars driving, just driving down the road, and they're  like out of the fucking, what's that museum out in L.A.?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, they came right out of a museum.  Well, because they got them from collectors, and they promised the collectors, look, we won't 
[02:32:30]  fuck up your vintage car.  Yeah, they're just beautiful cars rolling down the street, no rusted out.  Yeah, but they can't be messing up the guy's car.  Can't they make fucking fake ones?  Yeah.  Just fucking, it's La La Land.  How do you make a fake one?  No, it's too, it's too, it's very expensive.  And there's these, there's these slow-moving scenes where he's looking around, and it's  just showing you everything that's in the 70s.  Everyone has an afro, everyone's wearing belts.  We'd like you to show us everything that's in the 40s.  Giving peace signs. 
[02:33:00]  Outside of Warsaw.  Oh.  Poor skinny Travis.  Poor slender boy.  We'd like you to show us Barracks 4.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Which boxcar do you take home?  Oh, Jesus.  Uncaught boy.  It really is.  You want to do another one here, or what?  Of course, I want to hear them all.  That really annoyed me.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be something?  Wouldn't that be something?  What's a fucking bartender who would say that to an asshole who ordered a drink that doesn't 
[02:33:30]  exist?  Yeah.  Hey, give me a fucking pack of goose milk.  Wouldn't that be something?  Wouldn't that be the day?  What do you want, asshole?  What do you want?  Got some goose milk.  The only realistic thing was that Kipsy really is a shithole.  Yes, it was.  Okay, maybe.  Steven Jersey has some advice for you, Ant.  Steve?  Steve?  Hey, Ant, I would say watch the BBC version.  Just stop watching The American right now.  Of course.  It sucks.  Well, I don't know anything about fucking the 70s in England.  What the fuck am I going to sit there and watch the mods fight with the fucking rockers? 
[02:34:00]  Rockers?  Thank you.  Steve?  You know a little something?  Yeah, that's all I know.  You're on scooters.  I bet the English version's good, man.  I bet they only play who music.  You ever see The Office in England?  I don't know English.  The Office is...  That show is fucking hilarious.  Hilarious.  So maybe...  Genius.  Come on, give it a try.  It sounds like genius.  What's that?  The American one's better.  Corral's fucking crazy.  The fucking Fort Hill version.  But he's right about life on Mars.  I bet the English version is good.  Yeah, but I don't know the references. 
[02:34:30]  Well, let's have a try.  Maybe that's good because then it wouldn't annoy me.  You see what happens when you do know the references.  You want to fight the TV.  You're right.  We get it.  Coke.  Diet Coke.  Wouldn't that be something?  No, it wouldn't be.  What do you want it?  In a can?  Yeah.  Or in your can.  I love this new Holly song, mate.  Yeah, that's what it would be.  Let's do another one here.  And that's no small thing considering they were tucked snug behind bulletproof glass with  no witnesses, no sign of forced entry. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, that's very cool.  Hey, listen.  Any chance I'm going to get sprung anytime soon?  The laughing is on tonight.  I got it bad for that Goldie Hawn.  Look, see?  All right, see?  We're getting grunts from the fucking audience.  Anytime I'm getting sprung suit, that laughing's great.  I really got in for that Goldie Hawn.  Well, and even the way he says it, it's not even in a New York accent when he goes,  No, Goldie Hawn.  Goldie Hawn.  Goldie Hawn.  This show fucking sucks my fucking unshaven pubic region dick. 
[02:35:30]  I didn't think you would need to shave it.  You're very hairless.  I am, but I do shave my fucking bigger than you think it would be, cock.  There is, it's just, what I'm giving you here is the shit part of this show.  There's other parts where I really go like, God, there's potential here for something.  Maybe when Kytel talks.  Throw that fucking in.  Dude, the acting is awful.  When Kytel is sitting there, and he pulls out this wad of money that the guy, this guy 
[02:36:00]  didn't even steal.  He's just saying, well, this was found on you.  And the guy goes, no, it's not.  He goes, it would be wet like me because, you know, they pulled him out of the river.  So Kytel just pours a pitcher of water on the money, pours the rest of it over the  guy's head, and then takes the fucking money and starts smacking him in the face with  the money.  That's pretty good.  That shit's great old New York police fucking roust the motherfucker kind of shit.  That I like.  I don't like this fucking, I really got it in for that Goldie hand. 
[02:36:30]  The sentence should have stopped after, am I getting sprung?  Right, that's it.  Am I getting sprung soon?  He wouldn't be talking about what TV show he wants to catch.  Who the hell would say sprung?  No one.  Well, that's you.  What is that?  What the fuck is that?  Oh my God.  What is that, Colin?  Colin came from outer space and brought some type of mysterious beverage.  What are you drinking?  Is that gasoline?  Colin, for your listeners at home, he's drinking something called Diet Coke. 
[02:37:00]  Did you bring that from home after, what is this, Arch and Crafts?  That'll be the day.  I wonder what Mayor LaGuardia would think of this one.  Right?  Fucking assholes in Hollywood.  Fucking just died on fire.  Just put the fucking billboard, put a fucking thing on the side where it usually has the  network thing.  It's 1973 on this show.  Just that would let us know.  You don't have to ham-hand the fucking references. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, fucking cat.  What do we got?  Another one out of Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter, welcome aboard, Pete.  Yeah, what's the top shows we got?  They watch pretty good.  And why Petey Blue?  What's some of those other shows?  Hill Street Blue.  CSI Miami.  CSI New York.  Martin Miller.  Special Victim Union.  Martin Miller.  Martin Miller.  Miller. 
[02:38:00]  Can I tell you a very funny line that Colin would do, and you don't do it anymore, which  annoys me, is when you talk about how you're going to be a big mystery solver in your own  cop show, and you're going to be on CSI Akron.  He would comment, but he's eating.  He's shoving food into his stupid face.  Too much violence for me.  Let's get another...  That'd be good.  Your first show could be Missing Persons, and she ends up in my driveway.  Linger longer. 
[02:38:30]  Linger much too long.  I don't...  I got it.  Of course, Danny, got it.  I don't get that one.  Yes, you do.  Do I?  Apparently.  I'm going to spell it out with...  Oh.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  How about that Dr. Smith in Lost in Space?  I can't believe that show's been off the air for nine years.  First of all, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Laughing was off by 73.  68 or 67, right?  Until, what, 72? 
[02:39:00]  He got it bad for that Goldie Haar.  Goldie Haar-ing.  Haar-ing.  Yeah, do ya?  Yeah.  Like, a guy wants to get out of jail to watch TV.  Yeah, to watch Laughing.  Fucking bullshit.  Put it on cable.  A wire?  Why can't I put it on a wire that connects things?  Fucking overreacting assholes.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yeah, I gotta go get it online.  Are you gonna stand in a line?  What?  Who the fuck reacts like that?  Information Super Highway.  Is that off the Gowanus? 
[02:39:30]  Gowanus?  Just FYI, Laughing ran until 73.  Oh, okay.  I mean, I was last chance.  May 14th, 73.  Well, at least you know it's January, February, March, or April.  Right.  It better be.  Let's do another one here.  I took a look at the file, Gene.  The FCC has a better case against George Carlin as Seven Dirty Words than you have against  Kim Drenge.  This show fucking stinks!  I can't be happier that Jimmy is so annoyed at just the clips. 
[02:40:00]  That was bad.  These over-explaining faggots.  Yes!  How about this?  Yes!  The FCC has a better case against Carlin.  That's how you would talk.  You know, the Seven Dirty Words.  No cop would say the FCC has a better chance.  Maybe not, but no.  I'm just trying to, you know.  This is horrific.  It's the worst part of any show I've ever watched.  That's fucking stinks!  You take a show that people, I think, find a pretty compelling plot, and then just fuck 
[02:40:30]  it up.  They suck.  They fucking suck.  They got it.  You think if this was on HBO or something that they would be doing shit like that?  No.  Omar would be busy fucking some guy in the mouth and then shoot him.  Yes!  Much more blind stick my gun in a mouth.  Sup, bird?  I think HBO is good.  What up, bird?  Yeah, what up, bird?  A bird?  Yeah, what up?  What are you talking about?  A little flying animal?  He left the ass off. 
[02:41:00]  We got another one.  HBO, I think, is doing a 70s cop show, David Milchers, I believe.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Good for them.  Based on a guy I know, Steve Kalura.  It's actually a fascinating story.  What's the story, Carl?  Nice plug.  How about filling everybody else in instead of hogging all the fun for you?  How is it a plug?  I'm having nothing to do with it.  Shut up.  It's still a plug.  He said a nice plug.  Hey, he's more beat up than Evil Knievel at that Caesar's Palace jump that happened just  a real short time ago, because it's 73.  Look at this fucking book by George Orwell. 
[02:41:30]  Wait till that happens in 11 years.  The 1984.  That's so far in the future for us.  Here in 73.  Holy cow.  Oh, God.  I fucking hate them all.  How about a little subtle one?  All right.  Here's a subtle one.  This one's a great one.  A little subtle?  Yeah.  A subtlety.  We got a subtle one right here.  He just feels like it took his spot.  But I wouldn't take it personal.  Yeah, well, I didn't request his transfer.  It just happened.  It's like Guantanamo Bay in here. 
[02:42:00]  I wouldn't know.  I've never been to Puerto Rico.  Kim Trent, here is a DAT.  You are free to go.  You got to respect those who defend the Constitution.  All hail the Nixon administration.  Guantanamo, it looks like he goes into the cells that are really messy.  The guy from 2008.  And he's like, Jesus Christ.  It's like Guantanamo Bay in here.  I wouldn't know.  I've never been to the Caribbean.  Huh? 
[02:42:30]  That wouldn't even get an answer from anyone.  It's like Guantanamo Bay in here.  No.  And here's how fucking horrible the writing is.  If we walked in and said, it's such unnatural, fucking typical, awful L.A. writer shit.  If I walked in and go, Jesus Christ, fucking hottest balls, were we in Africa?  Would any of you actually go, we don't know, Jim.  We've never been to Africa.  I've never been to Botswana.  You would get that somebody's just making a reference to a shithole.  Yeah, crappy place.  And the bit officially begins. 
[02:43:00]  Let's say hi to Danny in Louisiana.  Danny.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Yeah, it is.  It's horrible.  Yeah, that's McMillan and Wife.  I bet Rock Hudson gets all the dames, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, look at that.  We're watching McMillan and Wife.  Yeah.  Because back here in 73, we didn't know that he was a fabulous.  I wish I got as many broads as Rock Hudson.  Yeah, well, he's got age.  Of course he has helpers.  I wish my dad was more like Mr. Brady growing up. 
[02:43:30]  Fucking in the ass.  What?  All right, we got one more here.  What's that?  Oh, um, Lee got us tickets to see Grease.  Because, you know, it's been playing for a year and I've been dying to see it, so.  It's been playing for a year and I'm dying to see it a year.  A year.  Because it opened in 72.  And it being, you know, 73. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, God.  I don't mind that one, to be honest with you, because it is kind of funny like it's still running today.  But let me tell you something.  It's not funny.  It stinks.  Let me tell you something.  I mind that one most of all.  There was no other reference to it.  It was thrown in.  It was at the end of the episode.  So, like, haphazardly.  And that was it.  And that was it.  And then we'll go to the next scene.  Yeah.  It wasn't a part of the plot line.  First of all, I don't like the fact that the woman, once again, she's a female cop and  she's talking like some, you know, actress from nowadays in the Midwest. 
[02:44:30]  Every female cop sounded just like Patty.  Yeah.  And that's how they should all say it.  Well, here's another thing.  The female cop is treated by the guys like shit.  No respect.  I know.  They give her the menial little tasks.  But she is so smart.  Of course she is.  And she should be, you know, she's smarter than the guys.  Can you please just.  Because they got to kind of make that politically correct.  Can you please just get my hint of doing the line as Patty?  Oh, I got you. 
[02:45:00]  How about going to see the plane?  God, am I horrible.  You're right.  I ain't got that idea.  You're right.  Going to see Grease.  I like the version with John Travolta in the movie that won't be out for five more years  or so.  Fifteen.  Fifteen?  Seventy-three to seventy-nine?  I stand corrected.  Jesus Christ.  I am such a fucking dumb five-year-old boy.  You were talking about like.  Because I was born in 68.  You were talking about like 1988 or something. 
[02:45:30]  That's because you got your nose.  That's crazy.  You know, you listen to a bunch of talking heads like the band.  Jesus, I don't know what I'm fucking doing.  Well, with that, why don't we take a break.  Let's just do heavy-handed references to now like they were doing then and see how casually  they fit into the conversation.  Well, let's make believe we didn't say that.  And after the break, we go into that mode.  Yes.  I'm fucking going to eat a pretzel.  The listeners and everybody else.  You having a pretzel?  Current President Bush almost choked on one. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, well, I remember that one.  But that is, there's nothing wrong with that.  That is just as stupid.  Can I just make one last suggestion?  Yeah.  Can you please do Patty in Goodfellas?  Doing like one of Henry Hill's voiceovers.  Like to us, the airport was in our backyard.  Oh, I would have more gone with.  Hey, touched me.  And then he tried to throw me out of the car. 
[02:46:30]  That does sound like it.  You don't understand, Daddy.  Louis Brocco does sound like Patty.  Yeah, that's true.  But we're at the emotional range.  She's fucking horrendous.  She fucking wrecks everything she's in.  I like to squeeze her tits and then just push her into an acting class.  They wore cheap clothes, a lot of pantsuits, and too much makeup, and they had bad skin. 
[02:47:00]  Good fellas.  What, are we taking a break?  Come back?  All right, man.  What the hell's going on here? 
[02:47:30]  All right, we're going to have Jason Ritter come in here in just a minute or two.  He's in the new movie, W, also a movie called Good Dick, out now in limited release. 
[02:48:00]  But, I mean, if Jason wants to talk about this, we're talking about Madonna.  A-Rod is now going to officially start effing her.  You think so?  Yeah.  That's what they're saying on all the gossip sites.  And we were talking about, would you have sex with Madonna?  No.  And obviously for the story you would, but for the star fuck, you'd have to.  Right.  But if she was just some bitch walking down the street, you wouldn't give her a second look. 
[02:48:30]  You wouldn't go into it?  You wouldn't give her a second look.  You wouldn't go into it thinking, wow, this is going to be great.  You would do it because it's Madonna and then you run back to your friends and go, holy  shit, you're not going to believe this.  Yeah, fuck Madonna.  Yeah.  Oh, snap.  Dude, she's.  Oh, snap.  But A-Rod is what, 33?  Dag.  But he fucks everything on the planet.  It's like he's bored.  He's younger than 33, isn't he?  How old is he?  He's got to be bored.  He's 33.  He's bored, you think?  Yeah.  And he wants into that 50-year-old pussy.  He wants to fuck a girl who isn't impressed that he's A-Rod. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  She doesn't give a fuck about his 200 million.  You know, why do you have to curse so much, Joey?  Colin, where are you at with the Madonna thing?  I don't think about it either way.  How about if she wasn't 10 years younger than you?  Would you fuck her?  Oh.  That's not nice.  She's a chippy for Colin.  Oh.  Oh.  You guys are out of line.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I'm feeling you.  Where's, uh, let's bring in Jason.  Jason Ritter.  From Good Dick. 
[02:49:30]  La-da-da-da-da.  Roland opens the door for Jason Ritter.  Roland is the consummate doorman.  What's up, Jason?  Nice to meet you.  Take a seat.  Hey.  What's up, JR?  Hey.  How you doing, man?  How are you?  Were you just on CW11?  Yes, I was.  Ah.  Oh, cool.  Let's just notice one thing.  Out of everybody here, because Jason rolls in Hollywood, the only one who's genuinely like,  wow, his eyes pop was the legend.  I saw that, too.  And it disappointed me.  Because he thought you were tired.  He was happy to see you doing something.  I saw you do a stellar show in New York a long time ago. 
[02:50:00]  I loved it.  It was really funny.  Thanks, JR.  Yeah, no problem.  Colin is a legendary, man.  No, thanks for having me on.  This is awesome.  I can't believe I'm here.  Oh, no problem.  You're in a huge movie.  Being here, really?  Yeah, it's a no-brainer, actually.  It really takes kind of a dip.  No, no, no.  This is awesome for me.  So you're in W?  Yeah, I have a brief scene in W.  And that is as George's brother. 
[02:50:30]  Jeb.  The golden child of the Bush family.  Yeah.  I would guess the younger version of Jeb.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm only in the flashback scene.  Unless they did some prosthetic makeup on you.  No, no.  Just in a flashback, he comes home drunk, and I slam him against the wall and say, calm  down.  That's my whole.  That's it.  Calm down.  Yeah.  It was very cathartic, though.  Yeah.  I feel like.  For me and for Jeb.  I feel like that needed to happen.  That's your whole part?  That's it, yeah.  So don't drink, you know, don't get a large Coke when you go see the movie, because you'll  miss me. 
[02:51:00]  We're getting all the...  We're getting all the...  Calm down.  You're wrecking your life.  Yeah, exactly.  How many takes did it take you to do Calm Down?  Uh, it took me quite a few.  That's funny.  To be honest.  I was a little nervous.  When one line...  When you got one line, you just...  Calm down!  Yeah.  No, that's true.  You, like, you way overthink it.  And then you're like, there's so many different ways I can say this, and you come out and  it doesn't sound human anymore.  What's my motivation?  You're like, I'm going to pronounce the L in calm.  It'll be great.  Calm down.  Yes, that's better. 
[02:51:30]  No, they do it like Life in Mars.  Calm down.  Your attitude is too fiery.  You're going to end up in trouble someday.  You'll get us into a war.  Exactly.  Why, you.  Yeah.  So, you do that.  Were you directed by Oliver Stone during this scene?  Yeah, definitely.  Or did you leave it to, like, somebody else?  No, no.  He was there.  He was pretty hands-on, which was awesome, man.  Were you freaked out seeing Oliver Stone right there?  I was...  Was he trying to act?  Yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, he hid, but yeah, I knew he was somewhere in the house, and I was intimidated, but he 
[02:52:00]  was so cool.  He was, like, a really nice guy.  I didn't know what to expect, you know?  Yeah, he seems like just kind of like a mellow pothead who's probably, he walks away a lot  in mid-conversation.  That's the type of guy he seems like, like he's just distracted all the time, and you'll  start talking, and he'll just, like, walk away from there or whatever.  And then you'll just go, oh, okay, okay.  All awkward.  Yeah, because people watch it, and they see it, and they have to kind of act like that was the  end for you, too.  You ever have somebody do that to you, that's fucking awful.  Yeah, and they would walk away while you're still talking.  I've had people do that a lot.  It's humiliating. 
[02:52:30]  Now, wasn't Jed like the favorite of the father, though?  Jeb.  Jeb.  What is this, Jed?  Fucking, uh...  J-E-B.  You're talking about the Beverly Hillbillies.  Yeah, what's up, Colin?  Yeah, that's all right.  It's Jed Bush.  It's Jed Bush.  It makes no difference.  No, he, yeah, he was.  He was the golden child of the family.  I know.  Like, everyone thought he was going to be president, and, uh, George...  Because you saw when he was crying, fucking, the senior was crying one time when Jed did  some old corny shit down for him.  Jeb.  Jeb.  Jeb.  Jeb.  Oh, George Sr. was crying, yeah.  Jeb.  Jeb.  You could tell George and him, he didn't like George. 
[02:53:00]  Jeb's going to run for the presidency.  Fuck, it's Jeb.  It's you.  Jeb, yeah.  Well, we're going to do a little of that campaign in there, Grandma.  Granny?  I'll help you campaign, Uncle Jeb.  It's just...  It's Jeb.  I know, but you know what kills me?  Here I am making a big fucking sweeping point that could actually change the course of history,  and you cocksuckers...  It's an important letter when there's three in the name. 
[02:53:30]  It's 33.3% of the name, dummy.  It's not like his name is Aristotle.  Aristobble.  Did you demand to meet Jeb Bush because you were playing him?  You should have said, like, I have to get to know this guy.  I, uh, he didn't return my calls, unfortunately.  Well, what's his name?  Who did we have on yesterday?  Well, another guy that had one line in the movie.  Corddry.  Corddry.  Yeah.  He played Artie Fleischer, yeah.  There are a lot of us who had just one line just because we were like, cool, we can be in this? 
[02:54:00]  Awesome.  Yeah, just to work on Oliver Stone's fucking worth it.  All you should have done is just criticize his politics the whole time, like, in between takes.  Yeah, that'd work.  Yeah, you should have just attacked him for his shitting stance on Nixon, even if you didn't believe it.  Just to fucking bother him.  Oh, God.  Or just consistently.  That made me nervous, even the thought of doing it.  Really?  I just got nervous sitting here.  Just argue JFK with him.  Yeah.  Just do that.  Imagine how sick he is of hearing that.  Of hearing about JFK.  Yeah.  You know, but dude, let me, no, let me, a minute of your time.  Get this, get this guy off the set. 
[02:54:30]  Fired.  You're as crazy as your mother.  So you have a small part, but it is a part of the movie.  It is a part of the movie.  And what, what did you, what research did you do on Jeb?  I just watched a lot of videos and read a lot of books and tried to figure out mainly  what was happening in that time period for him.  You'll be interested to know that he, it was like a little rebellious period for him, which  was very short.  Him too, yeah.  Yeah, well, George was an alcoholic for many, many years, but Jeb, he had a tiny little 
[02:55:00]  short window where he smoked a little weed and joined the socialist club at his school.  Really?  He was about to register as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War and said, hey dad, is that  cool?  What a coward.  And his dad was like, well, he went to the Vietnam War.  He did go.  Because his dad said, you can, I'm about to run.  It would be helpful if you just went.  Wow.  So he was a good, he was always a good boy.  So he pleased his father.  You know, it's just that name now has been so screwed that he does not ever have a chance  in hell of ever being the president. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, that's, that's a sad thing.  Yeah.  There was a, I read a little, like a conversation between Jeb and George W. where George W.  said, you know, I never grew up wanting to be president of the United States.  And Jeb said, I did.  Yeah, I did.  Really?  And boy, you really screwed that up, buddy.  Thanks a lot, bro.  George said, yeah, you did.  Yeah.  Plus he went to Vietnam and he, uh, George didn't.  It's so weird.  Yeah, George.  He was busy here.  He was in the National Guard.  With Oliver Stone.  That'd be a great.  You're not a fucking firing squad, Bonds.  Bonds! 
[02:56:00]  That'd be a great platform for Jeb to run under.  I'm neither one of those assholes.  Exactly.  I'm the hope.  Yeah, no, uh, but, uh, yeah.  No, Jason's in, uh, W, but he's also in this movie called Good Dick.  I got a copy yesterday.  I did not see it.  That's cool.  I thought you were coming in next week.  No problem.  I want to see it, but I'm, I'm hearing good things about Good Dick and he stars in this  thing.  Yeah, that's the main thing.  That's the main reason he's here.  They laugh at the title.  I play the title character also.  Good Dick.  Because you know, the audience knew right when Opie said that, that it will be isolated 
[02:56:30]  as a clip that will be on my sound machine and I will be able to have Opie go, I heard  good things about Good Dick.  Good Dick.  And, uh, yeah.  Good point.  So what's that, what's that about?  Uh, it's basically.  No, no, what's, what's Good Dick all about?  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Don't try to avoid it.  Jim, maybe you can enlighten us?  Well, it depends on how passable the tranny is.  Yeah, it's not gay if there's a skirt over it.  All right.  All right.  Uh, no, it's, it's basically about, I, I, my, my character works in this video store and, 
[02:57:00]  uh, this, this woman comes in every day and does nothing but rent erotica and then go  home.  So I get a little obsessed with her and, uh, you know, do what you normally do in that  situation.  You look up her address on the computer.  You know what the funniest part about that was?  We'll listen to his experience and he goes, she rents erotica and everyone's eyes got serious  like, okay, now this is going on.  Oh, right?  Erotica?  This is something we need to hear about.  The whole fucking place is quiet.  Erotica.  No, yeah, you know, don't be, don't be fooled by the title. 
[02:57:30]  There's no penises in this movie.  Nah.  You know, it's, it's all, it's, you know, very straightforward.  So you become, as a guy, like, really turned on by the fact that this dirty girl is renting  pornography.  That's exactly, that's exactly right.  Are you, you can research with Jimmy.  You wrote and directed it, who's co-starring, so it's really based on our inner thoughts.  Yeah, yeah, Mariana Palka, who, uh, wrote and directed it, is, uh, starring with me.  Are you, are you the, are you the bull in the movie?  The, uh, I, I think so.  I'm not a hundred percent.  Do you know what, do you know what the bull does? 
[02:58:00]  Uh, uh, we're obsessed with cuckolding on this show.  Cuckolding is, like, a lot of guys want to watch their wives have sex with other people.  Oh, I see.  I don't know who these lot of guys are.  Well, there are, there's plenty of them, everyone.  Please fuck my wife, please.  Well, why don't we take a survey, Anthony?  We've got, we've got a crowd out there.  Fuck my wife.  How many guys are into watching their wife, uh, have sex with another guy?  Wow.  So it's not big with this group.  Look at those hands going up.  Not one hand.  I can't imagine a guy being enjoyable.  This is a bad question, because they're all homosexuals. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, okay.  That's not.  Um, so you, you play, it's a comedy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, so you, she's, what kind of porn is she renting?  Is it like a specific?  She's renting, like, silly 80s erotica, like, you know, like, hey, we're in a ghost,  and it's filled with, we're in a haunted castle, and it's filled with sexy ghosts, and they  want me, and like, or like, I'm an alien, and you must teach me the ways of human sex.  They were ridiculous back then.  They were totally ridiculous.  Dumb friggin' 80s porno. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, they didn't spend a lot of time on, uh...  Just get to the point is pretty much where I'm at.  They spent a lot of time on plot, which is not necessarily what you want to do.  I like some plot, though.  If the plot was good, because I'm, it's like the sex, the taboo of the dirty shit, like,  oh my god, she's sucking her uncle's dick.  Like, it was so fucking hot.  It's the, uh...  It's the...  Well, it's like, you ever see, like, in Boogie Nights, when he goes, you made a good film  here, Jack.  And he's like, mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the directors want to keep themselves interested, too. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe back then.  And it's the anticipation.  You're like, oh my god, a sexy ghost is gonna appear any second.  One of the...  One of the things I remember from my first porno was a movie with a woman named Kelly Mint  called The Fur Trap.  It was about a fur plane.  I walked to my buddy Roger's house.  I was so turned on, I had to go into his parents' bathroom.  I laid on the floor of his parents' bathroom, and I jacked off, like, with my head near  some Indian people's toilet.  Wow, you were really fucking...  It's changed my life.  But in The Fur Trap, it was Kelly Mint and another girl, and the girl seduced her, and 
[03:00:00]  she was like, no, we shouldn't...  It was like that lead, and it wasn't just two girls burning their faces.  It was like a sexy little lead-up to it.  That's the anticipation.  That's what it's all about.  But can you imagine this horrible prone troll lying on the floor of some horribly decorated  Indian bathroom whacking off?  My friend, we were just sitting there being a fucking horrid...  I got up, because my Roger...  I don't know if he jacked off like I think.  We were just sitting on the floor.  It was so homorotic.  Well, that's the weird thing, yeah.  A lot of dudes, like, watch that stuff together.  I don't quite get that.  No.  This was the one and only time.  Never again. 
[03:00:30]  I've never seen a porno.  No, I understand.  Top load VCR.  I think a lot of people have done it, but I don't think a lot of people have really looked  into what's actually happening in those moments.  There's two dudes with boners hanging out.  That's exactly what it was.  And Raj was sitting there.  I'm like, I gotta go to the bathroom.  And I went up, and I couldn't even get home.  I lived across the street.  I just went across the street.  I swear, if anybody else said that, you'd think they were lying, but I believe it.  No, it's true.  My dick had to be taken care of, and I just laid on the floor.  My back was on the cold tile, and my head was on the fucking mat with the toilet.  I was the audience to see the dead-eyed stare as he lies on the floor. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  My buddy Frank, who's a cop now, his dad had a lot of porn.  And I remember there was a cool one.  It was a Ron Jeremy one.  They dubbed his voiceover, but it was shot on video.  And that looked so raw and real.  When you saw porn on video, it was like a crystal and alive.  Why'd they dub his voiceover?  I don't know.  That's weird.  I don't know.  It's so bizarre.  Was he offended by that?  Was he like, that's my work!  That's my...  I would love to ask him.  Damn you.  Because one of the girls who suck, he plays a piano teacher, and there's two girls, and 
[03:01:30]  they go, oh, God, and it's awful, and they blow them.  But one of the girls had braces, and I think she was so sexy.  I'd love to ask him who she was, because he knows all the old-school porn people.  So I had to...  My friend Frank was in his basement with a bunch of guys watching, and I actually had  to find an excuse to sneak back into his house.  Like, Frank, they were all at the pool.  I'm like, I gotta go downstairs.  I left my gunk.  Are you shitting me?  And I jacked off in his basement.  Oh, wow.  Next to his weights.  Did you pop it back in, or...?  Of course. 
[03:02:00]  I went down to put the movie in, and I was just like, I just jacked off real quick.  And I don't remember if I shot a load, or if I heard them coming out.  Do you think anyone actually believes those excuses of, like, when you're watching something  like that?  Sorry, I'm just getting a soda.  Yeah, and it takes a while.  I'll be back in, like, 15 minutes.  Come back all flushed and sweating.  Yeah, exactly.  Tissuing off your hand.  I decided to drink it in there.  I didn't want to...  Yes, I apparently spilled it all over the front of my shirt.  No, I don't think...  I think they would believe it, because back then, no one...  You agree to believe it. 
[03:02:30]  You all agree to believe it.  It's an unspoken thing.  Yeah, he just has to...  He just has to go take a shit right now.  Take a shit.  That was a shit.  A shit out of his dick.  Comes out white.  Norton, I've never seen him so alive.  So when he just started describing the porn...  Oh, yeah.  He was so...  It's like...  It's his whole life.  You ever see, like, in the Untouchables, when you see, at the end, De Niro's crying, watching  the opera?  You know, when he's playing Al Capone?  That's what it reminds me of.  Yeah.  He's tears to his eyes.  A little sympathy.  No, but nobody acknowledged that they jerked off. 
[03:03:00]  So you...  It wasn't...  Nobody was really...  We were all just kind of starting to jerk off at that point.  I think they were 13 or whatever.  So you didn't...  Like, it wasn't like this thing that everybody knew.  Like, if you go for a half hour and there's a porn on, oh, he's jacking.  You know what he's doing.  And you won't care.  But back then, no one acknowledged that we did it to ourselves.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So in the movie, she watches porn.  Yeah, she watches quite a lot of it.  Do we get into any...  Like, what type of porn she likes?  Or is it just everything?  It's basically all that softcore.  Yeah, the silly porn. 
[03:03:30]  The silly old 80s.  And it starts off with her...  She rents this one movie.  And my character...  It's the first time that sort of unspoken deal is broken where you just...  Someone's renting porn.  Don't talk to them.  Don't say anything.  And my character's like, hey, let me just tell you.  This one's gross.  I just want to tell you, like, this one's not good.  You're not going to like...  I know your taste by this point.  He doesn't say this.  But he makes a suggestion.  And it's a little awkward.  But, you know.  She's creeped out by it.  Yeah, she's definitely creeped out.  It's really good. 
[03:04:00]  We were excited.  And starting tonight at Sunshine.  For one week only.  We're releasing it ourselves.  So it's a very short...  Unlimited release.  Unlimited release, yeah.  So it's only...  Sunshine's on...  I want to say it's on Houston in New York.  That's right.  In the village.  It's a...  Yeah, Houston in 2nd Avenue, I think.  Or 2nd...  Yeah.  Right, right.  Look at Jimmy.  That's where Jerry had his premiere for Comedian.  See?  Oh.  Jerry Seinfeld.  He just says Jerry.  I know.  Yeah.  And Colin just pushes his car to start it.  I just say Jer.  You'll never live that down.  You say Jer.  Pop the Clutch. 
[03:04:30]  Can I tell you how Colin...  I call Colin.  Sometimes Colin and I will eat at a place.  I called him one morning.  I'm like...  By the way, this is a great story.  It really is.  Dude.  And...  What an asshole.  I was...  I got so mad at Colin because I called him.  I'm like, hey man, let's go for some lunch.  And he goes, no, I can't.  And I thought he said, I'm having breakfast with Jer. 
[03:05:00]  And I'm like, all right.  I'm like, so...  I just kept trying to talk.  And he's like, all right.  I guess my card...  My dance card's full.  I'm like, what a fucking douchebag.  Like, he doesn't invite me to have fucking...  Oh.  ...a meal.  Like, what an asshole.  You can't invite someone if you haven't...  Wait, I had to finish.  That's the end of the story.  He's a dick.  No, the end of the story.  Someone all of a sudden has interest, don't they?  Shut up.  I know what the end of the story is.  I'm part of it.  So I fucking...  I fucking...  I talked to Colin the next day. 
[03:05:30]  I had a mild resentment.  I was really irritated.  And I'm like, oh, gee.  I was trying to be, like, joking.  I'm glad I did.  I'm like, wait.  Did I see you invite me to lunch with you and Jerry?  He goes, oh, no.  We had already eaten breakfast.  I was home.  So he said I had breakfast with Jerry.  So I fucking misunderstood him.  Oh, so in other words, he was able to think...  It was my mumble mouth.  ...think quick on his feet and say that he'd already had breakfast to shut you up.  No, because I could picture him...  No, he would love nothing more.  Oh, okay.  Than to have me call...  To rub it in.  ...and let me know he was out with Jerry and then purposely not ask me and then say to Jerry, 
[03:06:00]  he wanted me to fucking ask him to come so bad I didn't.  That's the way he operates.  But Colin, would you ask Jimmy to...  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  I don't think you would.  He would go, hey, what's up, Norton?  And he would point to the phone to see if it was okay to ask me.  He would point to Jerry.  And Jerry would go, no.  I would do it exactly like that, but there's enough truth to that that I have to do.  There's an organic truth to that.  Whereas if it was me and Colin out to lunch and Jerry called, he would not only go, hey, 
[03:06:30]  Jerry, do you want to go to lunch?  But if Jerry said, can you get a loan, he'd go, Norton, I got to go.  And he'd leave me at the fucking table.  Jerry!  Not like Rupert Pupkin.  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Now Jerry.  Come over to your house.  We'll do some work.  That's all right.  I'm going to be twice as famous as you.  Yeah.  That movie's so good.  That was one of those movies that give you that embarrassing feeling when you watch Rupert  Pupkin.  I guarantee.  We were talking about that embarrassing feeling.  You get King of Comedy.  Oh, God. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, God.  I guarantee Norton's first five minutes were no fucking better than Rupert Pupkin's.  They weren't.  Yeah.  Like yours were?  Mine always were.  Of course they were.  No, Rupert Pupkin's five minutes.  What's the matter?  You don't want to graduate?  Just bad, mediocre material, actually.  But it wasn't as awful as you thought was the great part of it.  That's what I'm saying.  To a fucking hack from Jersey, it wasn't as awful.  To a goddamn artist like myself, it was terrible.  No, a guy.  Shut up. 
[03:07:30]  Who fucking talked to a tape recorder.  Quiet.  To cardboard cutouts.  Clam up.  Clam up.  Actually, no, I'm going to get this.  I've been sitting on this since 1982.  Clam up.  Now I'm not telling you.  Now you lose.  Now I'm going to lose.  I'll tell Jason.  I want to hear.  I'll tell you after.  Hey, the commercial for your movie.  Tell me after.  Hey, the commercial for your movie.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Come on.  Will you please do it?  Wait a minute.  How about this?  Anthony, will you do Patty renting in the movie about the dick? 
[03:08:00]  It's called Good Dick.  Good Dick.  Good Dick.  I don't want to see the movie.  I won't even say the word good.  She's out there.  Bring her in.  Good.  Could you do the scene from the movie?  Acting in the movie?  Yeah.  I wish I saw the movie.  How old are you?  I've been able to do that.  I'm 28.  Oh, jeez.  I think you're like fucking 19.  All right.  So 28.  I shaved.  So you're old enough to be fucking, Patty's a little bit older.  I'll give her my seat.  Patty is, she's 52.  She's a virgin. 
[03:08:30]  53.  She's going to correct you.  53.  She's going to correct you.  Hello.  Hey.  Yay.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  Here comes old baby chiclet teeth.  This is Jason Ritter.  He's in the new movie W and another movie called Good Dick.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Okay.  So you're in movies.  I've been in a couple.  Wow.  But yeah, the two are coming out today. 
[03:09:00]  So that's why I'm here.  So you're in Sharks?  I mean, you know what I mean.  Oh, you could say that.  Yeah, Patty, you could talk to them.  Yeah, go ahead.  Talk to them.  Oh, I'll come see them.  Yeah, good.  One at the Sunshine Cinema tonight for one week only.  Where is that?  I've never heard of it.  It's on Houston and 2nd, sort of in the downtown.  It's way out east.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  Out east.  Did she say out east? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  It's Montauk.  They're playing on the side of the lighthouse, dummy.  What do you think?  Out east side.  No one has ever said out east.  Never.  Out east means you're crossing a bridge.  You're going through a tunnel.  It's just a brutal attack.  That's all right.  No, it's, you know, it is east.  Launch missiles.  It's east and it's outside.  Jason, it's not all right.  She's stupid and we have to point it out.  Hey, no.  She says, you're looking so you're in movies.  Right.  Patty, come on.  You do better than that.  No, I'm saying that.  Why are you crossing your arms? 
[03:10:00]  You're nervous to be in front of Jason Ritter?  Do you do the scene with her?  You play Jason and she play the girl in the movie.  Is it a talkie?  I'm not that old.  Really?  Oh, well, thanks for the improv.  And those of you with headphones, Patty's improv is really big.  When is it playing?  Tonight?  That's not true.  Yeah, it is playing tonight.  It's playing, I think, yeah, it's playing tonight and it'll be there for all week until  Thursday.  You know, Jason was just telling us that he doesn't have anyone to go with tonight for  the big premiere of the movie. 
[03:10:30]  You're looking at a dude like this, a celebrity, and he's having trouble getting a date.  He was just saying that before he got in here.  Oh, I don't think he means older women my age.  You're older, aren't you?  He's 28.  I thought he was younger.  He's 28.  Jason, you would take her, right?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  I'll be a date.  Okay.  That'd be great.  I hope you like the movie.  It'll...  Oh, I'm pretty sure I would take it.  He's like, oh, you son of a bitch.  Why are you doing this to me?  She's grateful.  Imagine.  We could all go.  Let's all go.  Yeah, let's all go. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Could you see her walking in on your arm?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No problem.  No, this is good.  I like that.  He's an handsome guy, right?  The more people will see the movie, the better.  Very good looking, yeah.  Oh, very good looking.  You know what?  We're not used to hanging out with good people.  Jason's good people.  He's a good person.  Yeah.  We'd be like scrammed.  Hasn't just been beaten down by the business yet.  Right.  Like everybody else.  Why don't you guys just describe my height and weight while you're at it? 
[03:11:30]  Like Colin.  Yeah, you know, beaten down by the business, bitter.  You know, bad people.  He's a good people.  He's like the innocent young thing.  I'm like, ah.  Like nasty Colin Quinn.  Right.  Just bitter.  You guys have some nerve.  Colin's gruff.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with your height and weight.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Nothing wrong with your height and weight.  Please finish for us.  That's all I got.  I'm, yeah.  Go ahead.  Watch.  He was just floating down there hoping somebody else could smash me.  Nothing wrong with his height and weight. 
[03:12:00]  And then it's actually started for, and then you add in something that's insanely big.  Or if you're on and you need another planet with different locations.  Right, right.  Standing next to big A.  Yeah, yeah.  Your height and weight proportionate if you're made of lead.  Patty, any other questions for Jason?  Yeah.  No.  I'll come out and see the movie tonight.  All right.  What time does it start? 
[03:12:30]  You know damn well it's not going to happen.  I think it starts at 7.  There's one at 7.  Oh, gosh.  I'm not 100% sure.  One's at 9.  I should probably know this.  Yeah, that's one of those things.  Just show up at 6.  There's two shows tonight.  Is that your publishers out there?  Yeah, yeah.  Miss, do you know?  Oh, miss?  It's a 6.30 show and a 9 p.m. show.  6.30 at the Sunshine?  Yeah, it's at the Sunshine Cinemas.  Hey, is Jason doing?  And we'll be there for Q&As and stuff like that.  Yeah, we'll be at Q&As for both screenings.  Is Jason doing well so far? 
[03:13:00]  He's doing awesome.  Jason is like the nicest person in the world.  Yeah.  We're not used to hanging around with nice people.  Are you a married gal?  I'm getting married.  It.  She's lovely.  Married girl, are you?  Yeah.  She's a lovely girl.  Yeah.  She is lovely.  All right.  All right.  I'm sure that's not uncomfortable either to have like fucking 300 guys just staring at  you creepily from bleachers.  And 300 creepy guys staring at you creepily.  Yes.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day.  It's not exactly like the fucking Harvard rowing team. 
[03:13:30]  Instead of the blue seats at the Rangers.  So, Patty, Jason's a handsome dude.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Definitely.  I can't wait to see you in the movie.  Yeah.  You're not going to the movie.  This is all about it.  It's not true.  It's not a lie.  It's a ruse.  You're not going with him.  Why can't you?  You'd go with him.  She can't afford gum.  I'll go on my own.  Yeah.  I'll just come.  Yeah.  Well, we'll all be there.  There'll be a Q&A afterwards, so it'll be fun. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  That's cool.  Jason, by the way, we fingered her on the show two weeks ago.  Not for a crime or anything.  She's a virgin.  Literally.  We fingered her in the fart box and the pussy at the same time.  Did you guys fingered her?  Does that?  Yeah.  Who did?  Yeah.  Me and Dennis Hoff, Jimmy.  Is there a double meaning there or is that?  You and Dennis Hoff, Jimmy.  It is what it is.  No.  Quite literally.  Literally.  Oh, okay.  You're on satellite radio, my friend.  I got it.  Jimmy put a glove on.  Jimmy put a glove on.  I thought it was like some new Facebook term or something like that.  Yeah.  Facebook term.  Well, it brings it back to the movie because, what's his name?  Dennis Hoff from the Bunny Ranch out there in Vegas. 
[03:14:30]  He got the pussy and Jimmy threw it in her fart box.  I don't know.  I didn't put a finger in because she's a virgin.  It's the theater of the mind.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  No theater for you then.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's a blank screen, ain't it?  It really is.  Fucking projectors spinning.  She's a virgin.  She'll do anything but have sex.  Yep.  It's bizarre.  And then when she gets close to having an orgasm, then she backs out. 
[03:15:00]  She goes, I want to stop.  I don't like this.  It's weird.  It's weird.  I understand that.  I get that.  Everyone's different.  Everybody has their own things.  When you said anything about have sex, one time my friend, he broke up with his girlfriend,  but they're still living in the same house.  Yeah.  And she went out one night on a date.  And then she came back.  But they were still living together, but they were broken up.  And he goes, what'd you do?  Did you fuck him?  She goes, no.  Everything but.  Oh, wow. 
[03:15:30]  Ouch.  Oh, that's bad.  He said it was worse.  Yeah.  Because then you picture everything but that.  And then the possibilities are limitless.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  One in each hand.  That's hard.  Friends were involved.  Exactly.  That's terrible.  Oh, God.  He said it was so much worse.  At least you didn't bring him home.  That would be the more.  That was the next moment.  Yeah.  Now watch.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Any ladies in your life?  Yeah.  Well, yes. 
[03:16:00]  Mariana Palka, who wrote and directed and produced the star.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah.  We've been together for a while.  An item?  Were you guys together before it started or during?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sparks flew.  Yeah.  We've been together for about nine years.  Wow.  Are you serious?  Damn.  Wow.  Do some math.  We shot it in our apartment.  Yeah.  I was 19.  She was 18 when we met.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  Anthony.  Dawson Sniffer writes, this guy makes Brian Regan look like a prick.  Brian Regan's the nicest guy ever. 
[03:16:30]  That's cool.  I like that.  Yeah.  But yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  It was cool.  We shot this in our apartment.  We got all our friends to help.  And I don't know why I'm pointing to that TV.  You're pointing to a TV.  I'm like, what?  They do the Today Show from your apartment?  Yeah, there you go.  Or is that the I.O. Cable commercials?  Yeah, that's our apartment.  That's all of us.  No, yeah.  We, yeah.  It was like a really sort of homemade thing.  That's why we're self-distributing it. 
[03:17:00]  Is it playing in L.A. too, or is it only in the Sunshine?  It was in L.A. last week.  It's playing in New York and Columbus this week, and then later in Philadelphia, and later  in San Francisco.  So it's Columbus, Ohio.  This week we're on all over the country.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Columbus, Ohio at the Gateway Theater starting today.  And then October 31st in Philadelphia, and November 14th in San Francisco, Berkeley.  It sounds like a fucking hot content.  David Tell told me about a movie one time.  It's a foreign film about this.  She's like a foreign language teacher, and she goes into peep booths, like masturbates, 
[03:17:30]  watching all this dirty, filthy porn.  I was looking for it yesterday in Barnes & Noble.  I couldn't remember the name.  I was hoping, like, some foreign movie box would, like, you know.  Really show you something?  Yeah.  I couldn't remember the name.  Everybody knows.  Somebody will get it for you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Get the name anyway.  She plays with her vag a lot, apparently, watching porn.  Yeah, you don't see a lot of movies about, like, women and their relationships to porn.  Sexy.  Which they do exist.  Yes.  Sexy, you know, when you know a girl watches porn, it's probably more online, but it's  amazing how hot that is. 
[03:18:00]  You know, like, oh, you fucking dirtbag.  It's a sweet...  I think that online is becoming more popular than renting porno movies.  You know what, though?  Jesus Christ.  I tell you one thing.  Every Saturday night when I'm in Blockbuster renting a few films, I see the same thing.  It's hard to get them on the VCR anymore.  Oh, the late fees.  I could never bring them back on time.  Yes.  All right.  Anything else for Jason there and Patty?  No.  We're exactly on House...  What's the name of the show?  You're not going to...  Oh, my God.  It's about...  I'll go on my own. 
[03:18:30]  It's not a GPS system.  It's at the Sunshine Cinema on House Den and 2nd.  Oh, okay.  I'll find it.  She really is great for plugs, though.  And what are the show times again?  What is it?  I know.  I appreciate that.  I know what it is.  It's around 7, so, you know.  I can't believe fucking...  Or 6.30.  But wait, why is W playing on one screen?  I mean, it's like with dry fish.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Isn't Jimmy a tool?  Did you get to...  So, who's...  Brolin's in your scene, right?  Or is it what you guys are...  No, yeah.  It was me and Josh Brolin and Ellen Burstyn and James Cromwell.  And me. 
[03:19:00]  Jesus.  Cromwell.  James Cromwell.  Don't do that, boy.  You're not...  You don't have the practice.  I want to know how...  That'll do, pig.  Fucking Stretch Cunningham from All in the Family got to be a huge actor.  Oh, yeah.  That's him.  Yeah.  Stretch.  Hey, did you keep doing, like, Exorcist lines to Ellen Burstyn?  She probably loves that.  Maybe you should keep away from Exley, boy.  He's not...  He doesn't like that.  Lieutenant Exley.  He plays Bush Sr., right?  The father?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he does.  I don't know why I'd specify who Bush Sr. was. 
[03:19:30]  Like, people wouldn't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bush Sr., you know.  That president from the 80s.  Back in the day.  Yes.  That's one from Mars.  Way back.  Are you watching Life on Mars?  I've never seen it and I'm obsessed with it now.  It's that new Harvey Ketzel show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen commercials for it.  No, my TV doesn't work.  Really?  It doesn't work.  Why doesn't it work?  I don't know.  I think I was a victim of some kind of con.  This guy came into our apartment and said, are you getting free cable?  And I'm like, I don't know.  And then he came in and unplugged things and probably stole some stuff and then left. 
[03:20:00]  I was like, that's...  You are too nice now, I see.  You just let him manage your apartment.  No, he said this whole building is getting free cable.  And I was like, oh, God.  And then...  You're a fucking gypsy.  I didn't know, yeah.  And then later, the next day, I went around to all my neighbors and I was like, that was  so weird.  That guy came in and unplugged the cable and no one else had seen it.  Oh, man.  It was a little creepy and it's never worked since.  When did that happen?  That happened about two, two and a half years ago.  You know what's good, though?  Wow.  He's not a good cable repairman.  No, no, no.  You gotta call Larry the cable guy.  Come on, back me up. 
[03:20:30]  Get it done.  Well, I went as one guy, sir, Alvin.  Have you seen that early clip of Larry the cable guy where he's like, I went to the store  the other day.  Yeah, where he's not the southern guy.  The sad thing was, I was fucking at that clip.  He used to open for me.  Really?  I don't have to see clips.  I'm fucking 90.  Dan Whitney.  Dan Whitney.  That's right.  He used to work with me.  But he wasn't Larry back then.  No, he wasn't Larry.  We get it, Colin.  What?  He used to work with you and then shot to success.  No, but the saddest part was even like seven years ago, he was calling in as Larry the cable 
[03:21:00]  guy and I tried to get him on the line after the show.  I tried to get his number with the radio guy to tell him.  I wanted to lecture him and go, hey, that character's funny, but do it sparingly.  Like, don't look at him.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  You don't want that to be a whole gig.  I would have cost him $200 million.  I literally was going to lecture him.  He used to open for me.  I was going to tell him, hey, man, do that once in a while, but don't make that your whole  thing.  Oh, that's whole.  He's in arenas.  Right.  Sells out arenas.  Yeah.  He would probably have told Guns N' Roses, stick with the acoustic.  I mean, the electric stuff is okay, but you don't want to get too loud. 
[03:21:30]  No one likes that anymore.  Get rid of that slash guy.  He's not playing the guitar.  No one really likes him.  Yeah.  Get rid of him too.  Velvet Revolver.  Oh, God.  Terrible advice.  Hey, Jason, have you seen Two Girls, One Cup?  Unfortunately, yes.  I would never be able to not see that.  We were thinking porn.  Maybe we seconded the Two Girls, One Cup.  Coincidentally, that was done in Jimmy's apartment with his friends. 
[03:22:00]  Low budget.  That was your cup?  It really was.  I haven't even watched it.  Oh, God.  Well, Jimmy, Jason's such a nice guy.  Why don't you explain what you like to be done to you?  You know, it's just sharing.  What, occasionally?  Motherfucker.  No, this is good stuff, though.  You motherfucker.  You motherfucker.  He's a nice guy.  You know, you guys got something that is relatable.  He wants me to tell you that I've done some bad things, actually.  I've done some bad things.  I've done some bad things. 
[03:22:30]  I've done some bad things.  Well, you can talk around it.  I don't want to make Jason uncomfortable.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy.  He's probably, you know, he's a good kid.  Shower curtain.  You could, you, you, you, you, you had sex with a shower curtain.  I've been tickled a lot.  You've been tickled a lot.  A lot.  That's not bad.  No, no.  He didn't say tickled.  I thought he said tickled.  I wish my family was saying.  I wish I had said tickled.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  That tickled is not bad.  And I let him go.  I'm like, oh, yeah, you're right.  Good point. 
[03:23:00]  Tickles are rarely yellow and smell like ammonia.  Or, uh, or, uh, what do they smell like?  The asparagus?  Oh, well.  Only if you eat well.  So are you working on a project now?  Uh, no, I'm not.  Just, just, we're trying to release this since, um, yeah.  So we've just been trying to get it out there as much as possible.  Now he's uncomfortable with Jim.  He's like, no.  I would be too.  A guy who's been tickled a bunch of times, you know.  Yeah.  Elmo.  Tinkle me, Elmo. 
[03:23:30]  That'd be a good one.  Piss on me.  Piss on Elmo.  That's all right.  That's not so bad either.  That's not weird.  Really?  No one gets hurt.  All right.  He's fucking all right, this guy.  He's such a nice guy.  He's probably a bigger filth bag than all of us.  Man, this guy is good.  Always the nice guy.  Behind closed doors, it's like, all right, bitch, you take those fucking panties off.  He goes, he goes out, and he probably just picks up hookers and chains them and abuses them.  You know who he could play in a movie?  John Edwards.  Like the handsome guy, right?  With the secrets.  With the secrets.  Yeah.  What's the second? 
[03:24:00]  Nothing?  Nothing.  Not a piece.  I really do feel, honestly, I'll tell you exactly what I thought right now.  I'm agreeing with you.  I know.  But then everybody turned on me because it wasn't fucking vile.  Yes.  I really do feel like...  Honestly, I felt like I was just stepping it up a notch and everybody turned on me because  it was kind of, you know...  Yeah.  It could have led somewhere nice and deep.  Well, they're not really...  Fuck this joint.  I'm going to start my own shit.  The whole thing was, he looks a little bit like, I guess a little bit like a young Edwards.  I was picturing him with his hair shorter and just kind of acknowledging what you said. 
[03:24:30]  Thanks.  I didn't realize you wanted to make 13 episodes out of it.  Why don't you get yourself a haircut?  Why don't you cut your hair?  Show your face.  I do need a haircut, actually.  He doesn't talk much, your friend Henry.  John in Virginia writes, Colin to Seinfeld.  Hey, Jerry, that sitcom thing is going to hurt your stand-up.  Don't do it.  Yeah, exactly.  No one cares about observations, Jerry.  Right, right.  A coat hat, a sock closet?  Who the fuck would buy a sock closet?  I've given some very bad advice.  It's the fucking truth. 
[03:25:00]  You really have.  Horrendous.  Most of all to myself.  Yeah.  What you should do is talk into a recorder everything you really think and then play it back and  do none of it.  Do you have any advice for me so I can watch out for...  Well, here's what you do.  You go up to Oliver Stone.  You go, you know what?  I like some of your shit.  That's what Colin would do.  Let's look at Colin's career and do the exact opposite of whatever Colin would do.  Colin has had...  Teasing Colin. 
[03:25:30]  Colin's had a...  I don't care.  I love Colin Quinn.  That's true.  Colin's had a very good amount of success considering the human he is.  Like...  What does that mean?  What does that mean, Colin?  He's a very funny comedian.  Like, an exceptionally funny comic.  So he's gotten very far despite his horrendous decision making and his inability to play the  game politely.  Ah.  What's that?  Are you difficult to work with?  Yes!  No.  No.  No.  I'm not difficult to work with, but I'm in charge.  When I did Tough Crowd, my whole staff to this day loves me and says it was the 
[03:26:00]  nicest...  What do we got to say?  Yeah, exactly.  But when I have to work with other people telling me what to do, I get upset.  It can be upsetting.  Aw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like being pushed around.  That's all.  Rejection.  Ooh.  Don't like that rejection thing.  Don't like it.  No.  That's not my favorite thing.  Take this job and shove it and pump your fist to it.  I do it all the time.  Have you...  I think about doing that.  Well, I'll give you the...  My problem is what I was just telling you before.  When I was in one line in Crocodile Nundie 2...  No way!  I rewrote the whole script with myself as a co-lead and handed it in.  That's amazing. 
[03:26:30]  And expected them to do it.  So, I mean, obviously I have to lose it to Brandon.  That's amazing.  It's probably...  Well, you know, we never saw that version of Crocodile Nundie.  It might have done a lot better.  Jim wishes we had it more than I do, but can you imagine how...  I don't see Paul Hogan anywhere in this room.  You know, you win.  Checkmate.  It would have been the most...  It had to have been the most horrifying version.  But as Paul's fucking co-co...  Well, because I read the script with Charles Dutton and the movie was just like,  let him around New York.  But can you tell us...  Well, my version was like me leading around.  But tell us about your version. 
[03:27:00]  Well, I don't remember.  I wish I could get a copy, but basically it was me like,  hey, buddy, and this is Queens, and this is Sunnyside.  He said, hey, you ever go to this Irish bar?  Oh, here's what a mafia is.  It was just like fucking horrifying.  Did you give yourself a lot of the laughs?  What's that?  I'm sure I gave myself...  I told you that trick I did to Jim Carrey, right?  Where we wrote...  Like Jim Carrey wrote this treatment, like a fake treatment,  because we had the same manager, and I showed up.  He was with his girlfriend and my manager.  But this I did as a joke, and it was a whole treatment I typed out  about two Mountie partners, and one was like the crass kind of funny guy, 
[03:27:30]  and he was like the asshole, so it was like a comedy,  only it's like insulting to him.  And I just sat there, I go, yeah, I wrote it.  And even my manager didn't know, he's like,  well, you didn't even tell me about this shit.  I go, let's take him a few minutes to read these.  We're at dinner.  I go, nah, take two minutes.  And he sat there and just read it, and you could see he's like fucking furious.  And he was like, who is this fucking asshole?  He's like, every line was like, I'm the cool guy, and he's a jerk off.  I was like insulting his like Jim Carrey skills.  And then he does a stupid flip, but I did like really subtle.  And you could just see he's getting fucking furious. 
[03:28:00]  That's amazing.  And his girlfriend's sitting there like bored, like this is all uncomfortable.  What a set of balls on you.  And after like ten minutes, he finally just starts laughing,  because he realized that nobody could be this fucking offensive.  Except Colin.  And he enjoyed it.  That's amazing.  So great.  That's great.  And that moment obviously helped him do nothing for you.  You should have just kissed his ass, stupid.  You fucking ironic idiot.  Why did he just tell him Ace Ventura cracked you up a lot?  Could have been in one of his movies, but no.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station, Colin to Carlin in 1970. 
[03:28:30]  Enough with the cursing, it'll only hurt you in the end.  So, let's go back to Jason.  I don't know where we've just totally shows going.  Jason Ritter.  You know, Brian, you should stay away from the racial stuff.  People don't go for that shit.  Keep the tie on.  Keep it clean.  So, you must be working on a new project now.  No, he answered that already.  Anything going on?  Well, there's a bunch of movies, independent movies that I've done  that I'm hoping that will come out. 
[03:29:00]  You never know.  I hear they're called indies these days.  Yes, they're called indies.  The kids are calling them indies.  You auditioned for stuff that you didn't get that we might know about?  Oh, gosh.  So many stuff.  You know what I really wanted to audition for?  And I didn't even get an audition.  I really wanted to audition for Anakin Skywalker and those Star Wars.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Please, anybody but him.  Who was it?  I didn't see the new ones.  It was Hayden Christensen.  But it wasn't, I mean, you know, in hindsight,  you just think, oh, my God, the opportunity to play Darth Vader before. 
[03:29:30]  I've been so awesome.  Yeah.  So those things like that.  The other one that I really messed up was my, I auditioned for Spider-Man.  Really?  And it just was like.  You sure aim low.  Yeah.  No, these are, yeah, I mean.  As Spider-Man?  Yeah.  I mean, I never would have gotten it.  It was like, but it was, but I just nerded out for the audition.  Like, I dressed up and, like, tried to, like, do the gestures of Spider-Man.  Try to show how much I know and love Spider-Man. 
[03:30:00]  And they did the gesture of the middle finger going up and saying, take a walk, kids.  I was like, no, no, that's not how the web comes out.  They're like, no, we're just giving you the finger.  Get out of here.  This phony even had a line in Spider-Man.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, I auditioned.  Surly.  It's called hitting a home run.  Truck driver.  There you go, see.  He said he stinks and I don't like him.  I was like, no, please.  He walked in and saw my face like, that's the guy from Spider-Man.  I know, immediately.  You're in a blockbuster.  Second unit.  That's true.  I remember that.  Is it second or third unit?  That's the pivotal scene in Spider-Man.  Teasing.  I'll be going through the same thing. 
[03:30:30]  I'm up for an episode of Kath and Kim.  Cool.  We'll see what happens.  That's awesome.  It's embarrassing when you, I just, I'm not a good auditioner.  I am not either.  I'm not good once I get it either.  Do you ever see Ed, the show with, uh.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  I was in the third episode of Ed.  You're too humble, Jim.  You're too humble.  I played one of the three friends.  It was me and Shuler Hensley, who's on Broadway playing Young Frankenstein and another guy.  Like that legitimizes him.  What happened there? 
[03:31:00]  Well, you know, three men who've got a lot.  And we played these three friends of Ed Cavanaugh, Tom Cavanaugh of Ed.  Ed, they'd come back in his, uh, to see him now.  And after the episode, they're like, you know, they're talking about a spinoff for you guys.  And we're like, really?  Oh, no.  I thought we were going to get a spinoff of a show that was only on its third episode.  You were spun right off the studio lots.  It was awful.  I should have been spun into a condom and flushed down a toilet.  What a desperate to believe something zero.  Although, I was in a pizzeria one time on First Avenue with a girl. 
[03:31:30]  And we were eating pizza and they were showing a rerun of Ed.  Big spin.  And we looked up and it was my, yeah, exactly.  Oh, that's good.  Dangerfield said, you know, oh, you throw some pie at her.  Hopefully, she'll suck it.  And then fucking, uh, the old Ed episode popped up.  But her back was to the TV.  Oh, no.  And so, like, fuck.  I'm like, why are they showing this?  She's trying to get her to look at it.  So she turns around.  How embarrassing.  You know, there's that move where I would actually go to the bathroom and stand behind her  and keep talking to her.  So she'd have to turn around and hopefully see me behind.  As you're pointing at the TV. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, and I'm like, what the fuck is it?  You know, what is it?  The moon out?  You know.  He throws his hot slice on her lap so she has to get up and scream and look at the TV.  Yeah, exactly.  I scolded her.  One of my good friends had a part in Old School and we were at this bar.  And Old School was playing on the TV behind us and we didn't see it.  And all of a sudden, the whole group of, like, all these, like, frat guys who were out there,  they looked at the TV and they looked at my friend.  They all started coming over.  And we freaked out because we thought they were going to, you know, come kick our ass  because that's usually our relationship to frat guys. 
[03:32:30]  But then they came over and they swarmed him and we still barely got alive.  His name's Simon Helberg.  He's on the Big Bang Theory now.  But we've been friends since eighth grade.  He's really, he's one of the funniest guys I've ever met.  Who was he in Old School?  He was, I remember, he's the guy, he's one of the pledges.  Vince Vaughn goes, let's have a question from the guy who probably won't get in.  That's my friend.  Nice.  One of my friends was in that movie, too.  Maybe you guys heard about him.  Will Ferris.  Will Ferris.  Will Ferris.  Will Ferris. 
[03:33:00]  Owen Wilson.  You ever heard of him?  Yeah.  And Jed Bush.  Jesus, Colin.  Did you say Faris on purpose?  Yes.  I thought so.  I didn't say Jed Bush on purpose.  No, I didn't say Jed Bush on purpose.  Yeah, we love Colin.  I still agree with my great insight about Jed Bush being the favorite.  Speaking of Will Ferrell.  Yeah.  He's a fun guy to act with.  I gotta be honest.  Oh, well.  What the hell would you do with him?  Is he at the Wilter Theater?  No, he was on.  Why even explain? 
[03:33:30]  Why would I do that?  I ruined it.  I want to know.  Colin knew.  What was he in?  How old a man are you?  You don't remember.  I wanted a sketch on the show.  Yeah, your show that you wrote.  How old a man am I?  The man that put you in a sketch with all your idols?  That's what I mean.  How do you not remember that?  So I acted with Will Ferrell.  When?  When you put me there.  I'm not on your show.  I didn't count that as a movie.  That's how inconsequential it is to Colin.  He doesn't care about what you're doing.  That's how long I've been.  It's nothing to me.  I met them all.  You're a bag of shells. 
[03:34:00]  Bobby D.  I've worked with everybody.  That's the same person, right?  You have been put out with a fire extinguisher in front of all the majors.  Bobby D.  Fuck it.  It's the same person.  Well, that's a little more accurate description.  There he called in.  He put me in a fucking sketch with Will Ferrell.  He put me in a sketch with Colin, which is, you know, please.  Wow.  But how many of those and how many where you just had to sit there with stupid Patrice?  I paid my dues in shitty sketch acting with fucking Voss.  You know how many times I had to carry Voss or Keith? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, Voss.  You're like, Keith.  But the difference is, Keith, Voss has shame spirals.  Keith is so blind to his own lack of talent.  He literally stands there, like, just numb to his own leg.  And he's just like, ah, acting horrible.  Does he think he's a color?  Yeah, he has Keith Roberts.  He's a, you've never heard of him.  He's a colored fella.  If you're a black guy from Philly who goes to comedy clubs, you still don't know who Keith  Robertson is.  He's a black comic.  And he's kind of...  You're cheating.  Cheat on him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
[03:35:00]  He's like an over-the-top, you know, be shit.  But, uh...  But, uh, Voss just is a bad...  Voss, we did a scene once on the show, and Voss was...  Wasn't that with his kids?  With his kids, and his kids were actually decent.  And he was just...  Just awful.  So then they did a trick on him where they had Chaz Palminteri on the show, and they brought  Voss in to do a scene from the Bronx Tale, and Voss is bad even with...  And sketches with us with no talents.  Well, well, well...  So he got shamed so in front of him.  He didn't know...  No, but he didn't know Jimmy was going to play Chaz.  I was going to play Chaz's part from the Bronx Tale. 
[03:35:30]  So that's what Voss called it.  Or a Bronx Tale.  I told...  A Bronx Tale.  I said to Voss, uh, me and you were going to do a scene together.  So, and he's right...  He's getting nervous that we're going to do this scene.  So he's, like, in the bathroom studying the script, freaking out.  He didn't know Chaz was coming in.  And Voss is the only dumb Jew in America.  He's really...  Yeah.  He's no brains.  As stupid as they come.  He's like a Guido Jew kind of guy.  And, uh...  He's got tattoos.  So we set the microphones up, and we go, uh, all right, here we go.  And I get in front of the mic, and Voss sets, and then we just brought Chaz right in and  handed him the script.  And Voss...  Voss...  It was just... 
[03:36:00]  He did exactly what you think he would do.  Can we play it?  We haven't played it in a while.  He choked.  He...  We got that.  He shamed spirals in front of us, in the middle of the scene.  So we're in front of fucking Chaz.  I was hoping that the story was going to be that all of a sudden Chaz Palminteri raised  the bar, and all of a sudden Voss became this incredible...  No!  No, no, Chaz.  It's never a happy ending like that.  Chaz just jumped on the bandwagon to help stomp him.  Colin, we got this.  We should play it.  But wait a minute.  Just a little more of a setup.  Chaz Palminteri wrote this.  He did it as a one-man show. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  Made it into a movie by himself.  De Niro directed it.  Yeah, De Niro directed it as like a favor.  And De Niro wanted Chaz's part, and Chaz wouldn't give it up, so De Niro played the father.  So De Niro played the father, directed it, and Chaz Palminteri, his lines are delivered  with such smoothness that you don't even think he's acting.  This is just him talking as his life.  And then the stark contrast of this fucking horse-toothed boob.  Do you have a picture of Voss?  It's just so embarrassing to listen to the contrast. 
[03:37:00]  Do we have video of that to just pop up online?  We could show it all.  Or at least a picture of that fucking hyena.  If we find the video.  Robert De Niro.  I'm very surprised when he sees it.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you.  I gave it to you.  And Rich Voss.  Louie!  Beans!  I want my money!  A block.  Tale.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about? 
[03:37:30]  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20 and it's been two weeks now.  And every time he sees me, he keeps dodging me, John.  Should I crack him on or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian.  Stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue.  With a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or none?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at him this way, cost you $20 to get rid of him. 
[03:38:00]  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A Bronx tale.  How do you hold the right ass all the time, Johnny?  I try to keep my eyes and ears open.  And I read.  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  Oh, wow.  When he said...  Louie Beans.  Louie Beans.  When he said...  Louie Beans.  When he said, you read, Vos, what you read, that was the one he delivered wrong. 
[03:38:30]  That was so natural for him to be shocked that somebody read.  You read?  I was thinking exact same way.  Delivered like Olivier, that line.  You read.  You read.  That was in the script.  Vos just actually came out.  Next week, Vos is getting all his teeth pulled out and we're going to make him do his act.  Oh, God.  With no teeth in his mouth.  Yeah.  That's going on next week on the show.  Picture him when he came in last night.  Oh, yeah.  Do we have the video of that?  Like, we can just show Quileys?  It's so...  Oh, there's Rich. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, that's the angle of Shaz.  He's so bad.  We're watching Vos and Chaz together.  Vos is all nervous.  Oh, yeah.  You can't get the full...  I want to see his armpits because I know they're probably just dark.  What's with this awful angle that they shot at?  Fucking Sam.  You shot that Sam?  Jesus.  What are you doing, Sam?  I don't know.  He's shot on the floor.  Little bastard.  He missed everything.  He's an amateur.  He should be back in Syracuse.  He's a rank amateur.  Scorch.  Look, he's missing Vos's face.  Oh.  Sam should be fucking fired. 
[03:39:30]  Sam stinks.  Sam didn't shoot that.  Oh.  Here's Sam.  Do a little defense.  Who did it, Sam?  I don't know.  I went...  What do you got there?  Microphone, Sam.  Every day.  I wasn't even in town when that happened.  Sam's a rank amateur.  No, he's not.  He wasn't in town.  He wasn't in town.  I'd like to verify that.  Oh, mighty.  What's with that afro?  It looks like, you know, 1973.  Wow.  Life on Mars.  Fucking shitty writing.  Oh, did you write this, by the way?  This movie?  The girl wrote it.  Don't you read the fucking paper? 
[03:40:00]  You yell for the paper.  I'm not even on his show,  and I know the girl wrote and directed it.  Yeah, yeah.  Mariana Popkin wrote and directed it.  You uninterested cocksucker.  You shouldn't even gave him this paper.  I read mine.  I didn't read yours.  His girl for like eight or nine years.  I know that.  I know that they've been together for nine years.  There you go.  Since he was 19 and she was 18.  I hear everything.  Was she ever 17 when you were going out with her?  For like a week?  Well, no.  Well, we met when she was 17,  and then we dated.  Her birthday is September,  so we started dating in October. 
[03:40:30]  So she was 18.  I was 19 anyway,  so it's not like, you know.  No, it's fine.  I'm 40.  I'm 40,  and I never ask questions.  Believe it.  In this room,  you really don't have to explain yourself.  Hi, mister!  She's 18.  I do radio.  Here's a lollipop.  Oh, you can't get in the Escalade  until you can say Escalade.  Should have stayed exactly where I was with the lollipop. 
[03:41:00]  Hold it.  Thank you.  Summed that up.  Oh, God.  Oh, that made me very happy.  I hate bombing.  No, where's the new one?  Geraldo.  Hmm?  Oh, right.  No, that's opiates is that one all the time.  The what?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know where it is.  There's people in the water.  Yeah.  Geraldo.  It's fucking 11 o'clock already.  Wowie kazowie.  I'm in Reading, Pennsylvania tonight and tomorrow,  if anybody's...  Oh, no, Harrisburg.  Harrisburg.  Harrisburg, PA, doing a little gig.  Getting together some material. 
[03:41:30]  Jimmy, what about your HBO show tonight?  It's on tonight at midnight.  See?  Tonight is the Patrice O'Neill episode with Russ Muneev.  Nice.  And you can get I Hate Your Guts, my new book on pre-order at Amazon.  It's like $8 cheaper if you buy it on Amazon.  Yeah.  So, want to go order it?  If not, thanks for nothing.  If not, go fuck yourself.  If not, then you get an extra $8, don't you?  Yeah.  Well, but what about delivery costs?  You know what, Carl?  S&D, I don't get involved.  You can talk to fucking Amazon about that. 
[03:42:00]  I just, I forgot the product and they, you know.  Um, you know.  And of course, Jason Ritter in the movie W, out today.  You're in it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  You really want to promote this good dick.  Good dick.  Yeah, yeah.  Good dick, that's what I'm going around the country distributing.  W doesn't need help.  W's fucking stalling.  They're all promoting it.  Yeah, you'll be fine with that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get people out to see good dick.  Good dick.  Yeah, definitely.  Sunshine Theater is actually a great theater on Houston and 2nd Avenue here in New York.  So it's a 6.30 and 9 o'clock show, is that correct?  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  And we're going to be there for Q&As, but we'll also be there on Saturday and Sunday for the  two shows then.  So, yeah.  So come anytime.  And come Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday as well.  Okay.  By the way, where is it?  All right.  We get it, Patty.  Oh, it's out east.  God damn.  Out east.  Out east.  Lower east side is out east.  Out east.  It's outside.  She's just, she means well.  Yeah, does she?  She's just a bug.  Jason, now that we know you, you can trash her.  Just do it.  She seems like a very nice person. 
[03:43:00]  No, just trash her.  He's not going to trash her.  She didn't do anything to me.  She's not trusting to anybody.  She's a lovely lady, and I hope she comes and sees the movie.  There you go.  I never did nothing to anyone.  No, you had other people do it for you.  Would I love to see Patty taken out like fucking Mel?  In her mouth.  A good book.  Yeah, he can't shoot a virgin.  Whoever said you was one, Patty. 
[03:43:30]  He was a champ, though, at the end where he just goes, he knew it was happening.  He just goes, hey, fuck you.  Best fuck you ever.  Yeah, he didn't beg.  Gets shot in the gut.  We could take care of it.  He's like, all right, look.  Hey, we're at the point.  We could still deal with this.  He's like, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Can't kill a cop?  Yeah.  And then he's like, all right, it's over.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Well, when he saw the gun, he goes, first class tickets to the resurrection.  Put in resurrection.  There's no way you're not getting shot after a line like that.  But you thought maybe he was going to pull out two first class tickets. 
[03:44:00]  No, because the resurrection's always booked.  Why are we fucking promoting my motherfucking weekend, too?  What are you doing?  Well, then promote it.  And fucking Colin's there.  Caroline's Friday.  Caroline, is that tonight and tomorrow?  You know, yes it is.  I didn't want to be accused of being too proper like I was earlier.  You see that?  You bit the M that fed you language, please.  Because I would love to see Colin.  F that.  Go see Colin.  F that.  F everything.  Just go see him.  212-757-4100.  Very funny. 
[03:44:30]  Very funny.  You can probably just walk up and get tickets.  But I mean, if you want to.  You suck.  Wow.  You know, even though you may be busting my balls, walk up to a camp for a great major  part of business.  They certainly do.  Fuck you.  Caroline's radio is funny.  Enjoy your drive to Harrisburg, cocksucker.  I don't drive.  For me, it's a ride.  Lurch drives.  I like the fact that he says, Reading.  No, actually, Harrisburg.  They're the same city.  It is not the same.  Hey.  Hey, Reading, Harrisburg. 
[03:45:00]  I would fly there.  What are you doing driving?  Hey, Jake-off.  Hey, Louie Beans.  Hey, this is Louie Beans.  He owes me $20.  What do I do?  Should I suck his cock?  Oh.  Oh.  He was doing dice-clear as Reagan before it was so fucking brilliant.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  As they slip the surly bonds of Earth, they touch the face of God. 
[03:45:30]  Mr. Gorbachev, get your fucking wall down already.  It's your problem, asshole.  Oh, man.  Some sucking.  This chick is sucking.  I almost had dice sucking dick.  I think we did that one, too.  Nothing was better than footprints, though.  Dice doing footprints.  Download that one.  We might have to replay that one. 
[03:46:00]  During the hardest times of my life, there was one set of footprints.  Hey, Jesus.  Where'd you go?  Dude, Dyson, good dick.  Dude, Dyson, good dick.  Excuse me, sir.  So, you watch porno?  You like banana juice on your face?  Oh, gosh.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, I like watching pornographic movies.  Good, honey.  Let me tongue your ass and stick it in. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, thank you.  Good night.  Oh, God.  That's a little nice.  That is sad.  Andrew, dice, anybody.  Andrew, dice, anybody.  Doesn't matter who it is.  Yeah, there's a movie coming out just called D.  It's Dice.  I'm the president.  Bomb the motherfuckers.  Oh, God.  Andrew dice.  D.  Wow.  I'm the one where Dice is president.  It's a good idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm running against the schwarzer. 
[03:47:00]  I'm in character.  It's okay.  Oh, man.  D.  D.  I remember the best time was having Dice on the phone and doing that with him, and Dice  actually said on the phone, he goes, I'm not going to argue with me.  That's a good idea.  He was talking to the replay.  Yeah, yeah.  He was talking to the replay machine.  Dice cooked so weird.  We would only talk to him through the machine. 
[03:47:30]  I'm not going to argue with me.  One of these days, we should just drag his fat ass back in here.  Why don't we let Jason get out of here?  Yes.  He's a busy man.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jason.  It was a pleasure meeting you, man.  Yeah, thanks for having me.  It's exciting for me to be on with you guys.  Great, man.  You're just a kid in a business in Hollywood.  28?  You've been acting for a long time?  I haven't, yeah.  About 10 years, something like that. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Got the bug?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old bug.  It'll happen.  Yeah.  I got to bring up the fact that your dad was frigging unbelievable in Sling Blade.  That's actually what I was thinking of.  That was what I was thinking of.  Why didn't we talk about this a lot of this?  This was the book, remember?  Yeah.  I don't know, because it's one of those touches.  No one talks about my dad either.  Yeah.  Like, eh.  My dad wasn't an actor.  He just drank a lot.  They talk about him.  Yeah.  I talk about him throwing spit.  My memories of my dad was him throwing spaghetti against the wall and my mother calling him 
[03:48:30]  a fucking prick.  That was always the great fucking time of my life.  He was playing the dissatisfied customer in the restaurant.  Well, Ro.  That was all just scene work.  Yeah.  That was just awful.  Yeah, Sling Blade was fucking great.  It was such a departure.  It was whispered really soft on the lines of, just don't hurt.  It was really fucking great, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That sensitive character with the whole, and having to deal with that prick fucking, what's 
[03:49:00]  his name?  Dwight Yoakam.  Dwight Yoakam.  Who, by the way, who knew he would be that good in that movie?  I know.  He's incredible.  He's just a scumbag.  He's incredible.  He's playing Jimmy Jackson.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  That was like Jimmy Jackson.  And this retard in seven days, he's like, no, I'm just kidding.  And you know he's just not.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of my house.  That's how I break up every party now at my house.  I just get up.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Yeah.  He is amazing.  I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out. 
[03:49:30]  No, I'm just kidding.  No, I'm sorry.  What a fucking prick.  Poor little Frank.  Pardon me.  Yeah.  That is just a great movie, but he was fantastic in that.  Oh, thank you.  Although my favorite in that had to be J.T. Walsh.  Not just because of our similar personalities.  Yeah, you ass.  Wow.  Is he a fucking.  Oh, Jesus.  Just looking out the window, talking about good old times.  Is that how bad you have to be for a guy to murder somebody with a lawnmower blade  and say, don't talk to me no more?  Yeah.  He was offended by what he was saying after he buried a fucking hatchet in his mom's head. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, great.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, Jason, thank you.  It's Friday.  No, thanks for having me.  My party starts.  Yeah, it's party time for Anthony.  Right now.  Definitely.  Jason Ritter.  And that Sunday morning, I go, get the fuck out of my house.  I'm pushing people in wheelchairs against the door.  Gonna get the band together.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Carl, how long have you been standing out here?  Oh, God, right here.  Fucking stupid Carl just lurking.  You're just lurking.  You're just lurking in there.  Meh.  Wait for you to come to the door. 
[03:50:30]  Love that.  Great movie.  And Billy Bob Thornton will never be better than he was.  I mean, he's a good actor, but that...  Completely different entity, too.  Like, you see Billy Bob Thornton, and you can't even imagine that that was him.  No, it doesn't look like him at all.  Yeah, it doesn't look like him.  Give us some Mr. Woodcock.  He has been better.  I couldn't get through that.  I laughed all the way into the thing.  I couldn't watch it and laugh.  The funny name.  Shut up.  I did.  Woodcock.  Look at the penis.  I'm the poster.  He's on two basketballs.  Oh, and they're kind of by his balls.  Yes. 
[03:51:00]  Woodcock.  I heard, Ralph.  I got it, Ralph.  Cock out on wood like this, Alice.  You have no sense of humor.  Leave it there.  The cat will get it.  Leave it there.  I heard she just cuts him off.  I heard, Ralph.  I heard, Ralph.  It's the greatest shut-your-fucking-mouth line ever.  Honeymooners, nothing funnier, man.  Love it.  Chick, that's a guy thing.  There's nothing that will break a relationship faster than fucking...  Well, infidelity.  But after that, her not liking the Honeymooners drives me fucking nuts. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, I hope those are the kind of astute things we see in your book, faggot.  Anyway.  At least I don't have to hide my DVDs in the closet, though, when the girl comes over.  As far as breaking up a relationship, we'll have a little bit of a problem.  But I was saying, Carlos, I don't like your girl, because I just like the Honeymooners.  And what I was saying is I don't need the male Irma Bombeck.  Oh, wow.  Nice reference.  Jesus Christ.  The columnist from the 70s.  You know, it's 1973.  How about that Irma Bombeck?  Isn't she great?  I fucking live in life on Mars. 
[03:52:00]  They actually did.  He opened the paper up at one point and did say, hey, what's Dagwood up to now?  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  Did you hear that?  I blocked it out like a childhood rape.  Oh, my God.  He didn't say that.  Yes, he did.  You promise?  I promise you, Colin.  I wouldn't lie to Colin Quinn.  What's Dagwood up to now?  I don't know sometimes, too.  I always get a kick out of the fucking body.  Well, that's not a good point, but I understand.  Are we doing line of the day?  Fuck line of the day.  We're out of here.  Yeah, we'll just do it.  I'm calling it.  I'm calling it for rain. 
[03:52:30]  We'll just do the plug, though.  WebEx.com.  Oh, yeah.  Make presentations.  Do it from the comfort of your own home.  Fuck that.  They pay for this shit, Colin.  Hold on a second.  Check it out at WebEx.com.  You up.  Do us a favor.  WebEx.com.  Just go there and click on something so they think their advertising's working.  Yes.  OB cuts to the chase.  Yeah.  Shut up.  They're paying for this, Colin.  They pay for this garbage.  That's all they want is you to click on something.  So go click on something.  WebEx.com.  Jason Ritter, thank you.  We're out of here.  Thanks a lot.  Bye. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, that was so good.  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest.  The greatest of all time.  Ella.  Ella.  Eh.  Eh.  Yeah, we suck.  Opie and Anthony, y'all.  I'm going to.  Oh, that.  Oh, I'm forget my child.  Me.  falseו� app.  I'm going to.  Oh, my God.  дум  Oh, my God.  Merci.
