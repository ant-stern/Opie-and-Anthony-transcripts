<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a bombastic opening montage followed by shockingly offensive jokes, including a disturbing hypothetical about remotely detonated explosives on mentally retarded women.  The hosts then shifted to discussing hazardous driving conditions in New York City's snowstorm, detailing a near-accident experienced by staff member Sam.  A debate on snow driving techniques ensued, with Anthony venting frustration at other drivers.  This transitioned into a discussion of Kenny's frugal driving habits, specifically his minimal wiper usage, illustrated by a humorous anecdote about a drunken woman repeatedly falling in the street.  The hosts criticized Midtown Tunnel drivers clogging traffic despite dry road conditions.

A call from a trucker, Talon, further commented on Kenny's driving style and frugality.  The show then covered Steve's surprise birthday celebration, which involved minimal decorations (five pointy hats, barely functional noisemakers, and a small "Happy Birthday" sign), culminating in the unveiling of a blow-up sex doll with a vibrating tongue.  Steve's reaction to this meager celebration was aired.  The "Be Kind Rewind" animation contest was discussed, with highlights of funny entries and criticism of the contest's short timeframe.  They immediately launched another contest with a longer duration.  The show concluded this segment with news of Larry Davis' death and further discussion of the blow-up doll and the upcoming animation contest.

The next segment addressed the consolidation of their animated content across platforms, promoting "The Laszlo Show" and their Albany, NY live show at The Egg.  A lengthy rant by Jimmy about his awful driving experiences with Kenny, detailing Kenny's poor driving (lack of horn use, erratic wiper use, extreme frugality), and meticulous invoicing followed. The animation contest was mentioned again, with its prize being a Jim Norton CD, a "wow" sticker, and possibly an autographed windshield wiper.  Steve's birthday was again referenced, with a bizarre "Happy Birthday" message from Tim featuring multiple voices. The hosts discussed criticism from Cleveland, Maxwell's apparent shift in allegiance to Rover, and a Gene Simmons sex tape and its cease and desist order.

A discussion of the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama debate ensued, featuring a mocking song about Hillary Clinton and harsh criticism of both her and Bill Clinton.  Clips from the debate, focusing on accusations of plagiarism and responses, were played.  The hostsâ€™ commentary was laced with profanity and crude humor, commenting on the perceived lack of serious media attacks on Hillary Clinton.  A graphic description of a "pitted" surfing video followed. Listener calls, including one suggesting Anthony needed "serious help," were aired. Anthony discussed his forgetfulness, including forgetting to buy toilet paper.  The segment ended with further discussion of Steve's disastrous birthday, highlighting the poorly decorated studio and a misspelled, overpriced Carvel cake, and the airing of the "FU Line."

The final segment began with a humorous anecdote about a mispronounced cake order ("Etive" instead of "Ice Cream"), again referencing Steve's birthday.  The discussion then shifted to a scathing rant against a Cleveland radio host, Maxwell, using highly offensive language ("douche," "scumbag," "fat slob," "phony").  Opie and Anthony accused Maxwell of jealousy, plagiarism, and mocking his humor and radio persona, even revealing his supposed real name, Benjamin Bornstein, and encouraging listener harassment.  Specific criticisms included Maxwell's alleged stolen persona, commentary on their show (especially jokes about Hillary Clinton's legs), and use of dramatic pauses.  Interspersed were discussions about escaped chickens on a highway, the onaradio.com animation contest, a college basketball player vomiting, and a movie screening promotion with a corndog giveaway. The segment concluded with more insults towards Maxwell and promotion of Jimmy's Albany performance, all underscored by frequent sound effects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives where we use this unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where entertainment is going.  You're a drunken pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver when you're sober.  They are sick freaks!  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Now, it's snowing here in New York City.  It might be snowing in your city.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I can tell you this much.  All hell is breaking loose outside these studio walls.  Everyone's panicky Pete's.  Yes.  They're all just panicking.  No one understands.  They lose their minds in this weather and forget everything about driving.  All the rules out the window. 
[00:02:00]  Here's a simple rule.  Stay out of my way.  I'm not going to do 80.  I'm not going to do 90.  Do that on dry pavement.  I'm not that crazy.  But in weather like this, when the salters have been out, and there's snow on the road,  believe me, it's treacherous, but you can do 50 miles an hour.  No, you can't. 
[00:02:30]  Yes, you can.  I was doing 50.  I was doing 50.  We almost lost poor Sam this morning.  Jesus, what happened?  I would agree with you, but we almost lost young Sam.  What was Sam driving?  Well, all I know is, let me tell you this much.  Uh-huh.  I got in, Ant's not here, and he called Steve, and he was in a very bad mood because what?  There was an accident that you were stuck behind?  Yeah, accidents, salters, and just masses of cars that won't move. 
[00:03:00]  Well, here's the problem.  We don't have winter anymore for the most part, so when it does snow, it's the same thing that  happens, like, in Dallas, where they get a little, like, coating of snow.  Oh, and dusting.  Yeah, people just lose their minds.  That's what's happening now in New York City because we don't drive in snow anymore.  We drive in snow maybe once, maybe twice a year.  Yeah.  And we just don't know how to do it anymore.  Hence, all the accidents all over the tri-state area.  Anthony pissed off wanting to kill somebody.  And I was in full agreement with you, and I'm with you, man, because I know how to drive 
[00:03:30]  in snow, because I spent my years in Western New York and Buffalo, New York, so I know  how to...  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're going to go through that again.  Hi, good morning.  What?  So, I know how to get around out there.  Mm-hmm.  But poor young Sam.  You must have done something frightening.  His hair is standing on end.  Hey, that was my line!  Oh, damn it.  Did I do it before you got in?  Yeah, me, you must have.  Are you doing an Obama on me, you...  Bitcourt, bitcourt.  You plagiarizing ass?  Bitcourt. 
[00:04:00]  Take it to Bitcourt.  See, because Sam is growing his afro out.  Yes.  And we thought that would be very funny to say that your hair is standing up on end because  you got scared this morning.  Very scared.  He's scared.  All I know is young Sam was coming in today, and he's on a three-lane highway.  Yeah.  And next thing you know, he's on the same highway, but he's now facing a truck that's coming right  at him.  Yes.  Now, how did that happen?  Well, I'm used to driving in the snow because I went to school in Syracuse.  Uh-huh.  So, but I was in the left lane. 
[00:04:30]  Left lane?  I have a four-wheel drive Jeep Wrangler.  Very nice.  I was going, like, probably 40.  Okay, good.  And I start noticing I'm sliding to the left all of a sudden.  So, uh...  So what did you do, young Sam?  I kind of moved a little to the left and then tried to go to the right very subtly so I  didn't hit the wall.  Uh, did...  Did you...  What was the first thing you did?  I moved with the car.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Did you take your foot off the effing accelerator?  Yeah, but I didn't put...  Oh, right.  How about that?  I didn't put it on the brake, though.  Well, I didn't say that.  Okay.  I said just take your foot off the gas.  It usually straightens the car right the eff out.  Oh, it didn't.  Okay.  And then what happened?  Well, then the car decided, okay, if not left, then we'll go right.  The car decided.  Well, yeah.  And so I went a complete 180 into the next lane.  Oh.  Where there was a huge Mack truck.  Yeah.  Driving straight with me, which was next to me while I was driving. 
[00:05:30]  So luckily, he saw me, you know, sliding around.  He saw your awful driving habits.  And for that brief one split second, I was looking eye to eye with this guy who was driving  the Mack truck, and I just started honking my horn in case there was anyone next to him  or in case he didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, because that'll help.  Stop driving, everyone, because I'm sliding around.  Don't honk the horn.  It uses up energy.  Oh, that was hysterical.  You only get 500 beeps that said that in the manual.  Yeah.  That was hysterical. 
[00:06:00]  Absolutely.  We'll get into that in a second, because he did drive me in, and he was barely using  his windshield wipers, and I was thinking of Jimmy yesterday.  But anyway.  Shedding.  So I just kept turning the wheel, trying to slide more, so I wasn't in front of this truck,  and luckily I slid past that lane, past the next lane, and kind of into the side of the  road there.  Did you hit anything?  No.  Somehow I was untouched, and so was the car, and it stalled out completely, but I was able  to start it up again.  You almost had to call mommy or daddy, huh? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Why'd you stall out?  I just, I have no idea.  Because when a car goes, like, sideways, it decides it has to stall out.  I don't get it.  Was Iraq there with his death camera?  No, that's what I was telling Travis, that if Iraq had been there with me, I'm sure.  Oh, you'd have been a goner.  Yeah.  My face would have disappeared, because my neck exploded.  Whatever that means.  You know what, though?  What a dolt.  I think your hair would have saved you.  Yeah.  You're like wearing a nice helmet all the time.  You're wearing, like, an airbag right on your head.  Airbag.  Just an airbag. 
[00:07:00]  Like, filled with afro hair.  Yeah.  Were you nervous when that was happening?  Not when it was happening, like, but right after.  Like, my heart started pounding.  Of course.  Exactly after it happened.  My hair's standing up on end.  Yeah.  Hey!  That's a good one.  That was my joke that Anthony stole.  Bit court.  So, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, I kind of agree with you.  But poor young Sam.  Here it is.  Young Sam.  What'd you say?  Jeep Wrangler?  Yeah.  Four-wheel drive.  Yeah, I know.  They're cute with their little short wheelbase and everything.  It's very cute. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you.  You were, were you changing lanes at all?  No.  Okay.  You were just driving.  Yeah.  What happened that you're just driving and you start spinning around?  Slick road conditions.  Very good.  He's such a wise-ass.  I love him.  Well, here's my dilemma.  Yeah.  I'm driving on the Long Island Expressway.  Mm-hmm.  Very similar road conditions.  A lot of snow, a lot of built-up slush, especially between the lanes, on the dotted white lines that you can't see. 
[00:08:00]  It's kind of piled up with slushy, icy stuff.  I'm driving, as you know, my Escalade.  My Cudelic Escalade.  Well, you're driving a tank.  It's a giant, unnecessarily big, gas-guzzling vehicle that is also four-wheel drive.  And I love it!  So, I was doing a 50 in the left lane. 
[00:08:30]  And it was good for a while until I get behind cars that can't even drive on wet pavement.  Like, you know, your Mustangs and your little foreign cars that a lot of Hispanic gentlemen like to deck out with spoilers.  Things like that.  What a pain in the ass.  Get out of the left lane.  There's no reason for them to be there. 
[00:09:00]  If I want to drive and kill myself, please allow me to do that.  But there's no reason for them to be in the left lane.  Well, they decide that the conditions are bad, so they're going to just go 25 miles an hour.  They're slowing everyone down.  In the left lane.  And no one will pass anybody.  I love the people that decide for everybody else.  You know what?  I can't handle 25 miles.  Yeah.  You know, driving 25 miles an hour in the snow.  So no one else is going to be able to go a little faster.  Oh, is it infuriating. 
[00:09:30]  I'm with you on that one.  Move out of the way.  And dude, they will pace each other because they're afraid to pass.  Yeah.  So they'll stagger to where you can't get past them, but they'll all do the same 25 miles  an hour and take up the entire roadway.  So now you're just stuck.  Yeah.  You're just like, all right, maybe I could, maybe I'll use this on ramp.  I'll just zip on that for a second and get around this trifecta of retards.  You got to do them.  They force you to drive more dangerously.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Cause you got to make some, uh, some good moves.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  But, uh, I didn't get in until, uh, late and you know how I hate just coming in and pop  it right on the show.  I'm sitting relaxed.  How about you take your coat off?  That'd be nice.  I'm a little chilly.  So we, so we feel like we're actually like having fun, but it's a little chilly.  It's not chilly.  It was cold in the, uh, the office, but it's actually kind of like a sauna in here.  It's actually very, very warm.  It's getting nice and warm.  Kenny, uh, picked me up this morning and he was using the windshield wipers. 
[00:10:30]  Wow.  Barely.  And, uh, I was just thinking of Jimmy yesterday at the end of the show.  A lot of people didn't hear that ramp, but man, was that effing funny.  And I saw it for myself.  Just a shuka, shuka, shuka.  And it's snowing pretty hard out there.  Kenny's a cheapo who doesn't want to use his windshield wipers.  He doesn't want to wear out the blades.  Which is, it's astounding.  He doesn't want to wear out his windshield wiper blades. 
[00:11:00]  It's astounding to me.  He has figured it out.  He like, he does a little math problem with, with him and his, uh, with, with him and his  tiny little dinosaur brain.  And he figures out, you know, exactly what he could do with the windshield wipers.  Yeah.  For minimal, minimal use.  He doesn't like, uh, like he doesn't like to just have the windows clean because that  takes a lot of, a lot of uses.  And it's like, will you take it off of intermittent or at least put it on intermittent?  Yeah.  Because he'll just pull it down once.  He actually manually does it, the windshield wiper once, puts it back. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, is he the worst?  The worst is that he may, he may at one point, if it's on, what's it called?  Intermittent?  Yeah.  Uh, it may, uh, he would set it on the longest setting anyway, which is like once it'll be  eight minutes.  Yeah.  Goes left.  Goes left and hangs out for four minutes and comes back right.  And he'll, uh, he'll do it that way because he's probably afraid that, like, you know,  sometimes on intermittent it'll go over a dry thing and he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to hear that.  Oh, no, who does?  But I mean, it happens. 
[00:12:00]  That does 0.1% damage more to the blades.  Yeah.  It's going to dull out the blade on me.  Oh, these have a five-year guarantee I'm getting through five years.  Oh, he's, he's, he's a shucka, shucka.  He won't.  And it's snowing pretty good right now and it's kind of a wet snow where you really need  your windshield wiper.  Just put the wipers on to do the job.  It's the worst.  I gotta go to Albany with him.  Oh, good luck.  We would have went last night, but we had to, don't have to do radio today.  Well, but now Kenny, uh, was, was in a bit of a panic on the way over because he's 
[00:12:30]  like, Jimmy's going to be mad.  He's going to be, he's going to be a mess.  He's going to be like, why didn't we leave last night to beat this snow?  So now I'm going to have to hear it all the way to Albany.  You guys, you guys are just a comedy team, but I'm not, you guys are just a disaster.  He's right though.  The first thing I said to him when I came in, you know what?  I was in a quiet last night, but I don't want to wake you up.  I'm like, but I'm not mad. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Right.  I knew it was going to snow today.  I was like, oh boy, he's going to be a problem today.  I thought it was just going to be, uh, another weatherman lie.  So I didn't even think about it until I woke up.  I looked out the window and went, oh geez, this is going to be a problem.  Yeah.  And, uh, it was, well, it was a problem.  Uh, the other thing I'm on the way in, I had a short ride, but, um, God, there was this,  this chick just, uh, you know, stumbling home from the bars.  Cause we get up, we get up the same time.  People, the real alcoholics are just finally deciding that they need to leave the bar. 
[00:13:30]  Sure.  You know, on a Thursday night at four in the morning.  That's smart.  And they wonder why they, their career sucked.  But anyway, uh, this lady hammered with high heels attempting to cross a two lane, uh, Broadway,  two lanes, a Broadway.  Just, she fell three times while we're waiting at the light.  Oh wow.  At least we got to see something fun.  Kenny's like, she just fell down.  I'm like, I know Kenny.  I see.  I'm, I'm right here with you. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I, I also want to address one more thing to the idiots that, uh, in, in the Midtown  Tunnel, it's not snowing under the East River.  Once you get in the tunnel, you can go fast.  It's shell shock.  There were people still driving five, 10 miles an hour in the Midtown Tunnel and the pavement  is dry in there.  You're underneath the bedrock of Manhattan under a river.  There's no way it's snowing. 
[00:14:30]  They're in shell shock.  I can't take it though.  People drag snow in Anthony.  Their cars have some snow.  Oh yes.  So the first 50 feet, there might be some snow.  The rest of it.  And, and I looked at my, uh, my, uh, thermometer.  Once you're in the tunnel, it goes up by 10 degrees.  Just like that.  Instantly.  So it's not even below freezing in the tunnel.  So the wet road isn't, uh, ice.  It's just, but.  Move.  They heard that there might be some, uh, like a sleet storm in the middle of the tunnel 
[00:15:00]  though.  That might happen.  Yes.  The weather guy was saying just that last night.  You can only hope for one of those tractor trailers to burst into flames in there.  Yeah.  Just see fire shooting up both ends.  Uh, hold on a minute.  Let's say how to, uh, Talon, the trucker.  Talon, what's up?  Uh, good morning there.  Uh, I guess, uh, Kenny there, when he wants to sell it a car, wants to be able to sell it  with all the original equipment, including the wiper blade.  You know what?  You're right.  That dope in his tan interior.  It's going to be a long. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And I want him to get an eye test.  He refuses to go for an eye test.  Yeah.  He's scary to drive with it.  During the day he's okay, but at night he's horrendous.  I'm not good at tests.  I'm going to laugh because this is how sick I am.  I'm going to laugh all day long.  Cause I, I'm going to, I'm going to just picture you and Kenny driving to Albany, Jimmy, cause  Jimmy's playing the egg tonight in Albany.  Yep.  And you guys are both going to be miserable.  You're going to be scared out of your mind because Kenny can't see.  It's going to snow the entire way up to Albany.  He's going to be shucka, shucka. 
[00:16:00]  Jimmy's line yesterday that killed me was how Kenny was rationing out the rock salt for the driveway.  Anyway, I, I, I got, uh, I, I allotted 48 granules of salt for the driveway.  One, two, and I pictured Kenny just dropping one at a time on his driveway.  Oh, is that so funny?  You hammered him.  Oh, I know it's going to be a long drive and he won't get his eye test. 
[00:16:30]  And it's like, it's like driving my grandmother.  If she was six, five and a killer.  Yeah.  This is what I got to ask Jimmy.  Now, uh, it's going to be a very long ride in the snow, but at least you got good company  and you guys will be talking about stuff.  What's like a normal conversation between you and Kenny when you're driving long distances?  Oh man, I can't stop eating.  I'm getting fat.  It's okay.  Treat yourself.  Silence for an hour.  It's ugly.  It's awful. 
[00:17:00]  I know what our conversation should be.  So aren't you supposed to disintegrate during daylight hours?  No, they changed that in the literature.  Bella LaChisler.  He heard our rant yesterday.  He is a cheapie.  He heard our rant yesterday.  So when he picked me up, he's like, you can have a nice weekend away, GH.  And I'm like, and now I have to be Kenny.  I'm like, ah, it's snowing.  It's going to be a tough ride where I'm going as well.  Oh, you're going to the mountains a little bit, right?  Yeah.  Oh boy. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Hey, can we get some of that audio of the rant from yesterday?  Because it's just way too funny.  Yeah.  It's kind of tough to reenact.  Jimmy just went off on Kenny and his cheapness.  It's not even cheapness, though.  Because Kenny will pay no problem for stuff.  But he's weird about it.  Kenny's cheap when it comes to taking care of himself.  Yeah.  Right.  He's not like, if you're out to dinner, Kenny will pick up the tab.  He's not a bad friend.  Yeah.  He's just a psychopath with OCD.  And he literally, he doesn't want to use up things.  He's afraid of going without. 
[00:18:00]  And like to have those blades not be effective when he needed them, like he doesn't think  he needs them now.  Yeah.  This is the time you're trying to save them for.  Yeah.  Like you're saving them all the time for situations like this.  So use them now.  Yeah.  No.  He wouldn't use his snow shovel probably because he doesn't want to scruff up the edges.  He likes it to be crisp.  Let's go to Joe in Texas.  Joe, what's up?  Hi, Joe.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey. 
[00:18:30]  Anthony's the kind of driver that gets people killed because he doesn't know how to handle  the car when it goes out of control.  Are you kidding me?  My car, it's been on the brink at times.  And I know exactly how to recover from any type of skid, my friend.  I'm not the type of person that gets people killed.  It's the people that are doing five miles an hour that get people killed.  You have to control your car, man.  I do. 
[00:19:00]  What do you think I got here, sideways?  This ain't an episode of Sweet 16, all right?  Good point, man.  Look at Texas.  Hey, Joe's making a good point.  Look at Texas.  When you get a dusting of snow and your whole state freaks out, then come and talk to me  when you don't do that.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Why don't you just catch the subway next time?  Why don't you take the bus?  Attaboy.  Public transportation.  Yeah, that's what I'm taking.  Well, because Anthony's a fancy man.  It's not fancy.  It was completely falling apart at the seams. 
[00:19:30]  I like being responsible for my own transportation.  Well, we'll continue to ignore that fact.  No.  I'm in good shape.  You got a weird mustache and a soul patch.  You're still wearing your coat.  No, you're not falling apart.  Look, I was cold.  Why is being cold weird?  Now I'm not.  Tell me how hot it is.  Seriously.  Give me an official temperature.  It's not cold in here.  No, no.  It was.  Now it's not.  Yeah, here we are.  Temperature changes.  Travis has no problem throwing you under the bus. 
[00:20:00]  That would be 72 degrees.  Okay.  That's good.  It's not cold weather.  No, no.  But it was when I came in here.  All right.  I had a chill from the other room, the office.  That's 10 feet away and 10 degrees colder.  Probably.  I'll give you that.  It's probably 50 degrees in the office.  All right.  We're just getting started.  Wow.  We got to talk about Steve's birthday.  Woo.  Wow.  Wow.  The boys went all out.  Hope Steve didn't see this craziness.  They're all out.  You know, when people throw a party for somebody, they can only wish that it's this extravagant. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  And, well, we'll talk about that after the break.  And the animation contest, which is, wow.  Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  We'll talk about that.  Of course, you got the Hillary Obama debate last night.  Hillary Obama's running?  Who's she?  Your worst nightmare.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:21:00]  Oopsie.  What the hell?  Enough with this song.  Exactly.  It's the third time this morning.  We don't need it anyway.  We're back.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Very, very busy morning.  It's snowing here in New York City, so people are just not happy.  They're losing their minds.  Yeah, don't tune to the news stations.  It's going to snow.  That's all you need to know.  And it's going to be snowing, what, all day until 1 this morning.  There you go.  There you go.  I did what takes the news over a half hour to do because they have to tease the weather for 25 minutes. 
[00:21:30]  Then they finally get to it.  It's Steve's birthday, everybody.  Of course it is.  How could you not see that?  And Sam, I just want to, you know, what, I want to congratulate you on the fine decorating job.  Commend him.  Yeah, commend you on the fine job.  He has done an amazing job.  Thank you.  I just wanted to, you know, make sure we were all celebrating today.  It's a big day.  Is it?  We can't even do that right. 
[00:22:00]  What do you mean?  The email went out yesterday that it's Steve's birthday today.  Yeah.  And Sam, of course, had a reply with some sarcastic crap.  What?  Saying, you know.  That's what he does.  Basically, he said something like, it's lucky me.  I got the job of decorating the studio for Steve's birthday tomorrow, which is now today.  Yeah.  And all morning as we're in the office, like, Steve's trying to get into the studio because he's got stuff to set up for the show.  And everyone's like, oh, you can't go in there yet, Steve.  So Steve knows something's going on. 
[00:22:30]  And he's not stupid.  It's his birthday, right?  All that.  And so I'm thinking, what?  He's not stupid.  He's not stupid.  What are they doing in there?  What's going on?  So.  I'm going to sneak a peek.  So when it was time for us to get into the studio, I'm picturing a display of epic proportions for Steve's birthday.  Has Steve seen this yet?  No.  No, he has not seen this yet.  No.  It has not been allowed in the studio, Jimmy. 
[00:23:00]  And I'm thinking, wow, the boys must have went all out.  I mean, Steve's been with the radio show off and on for 10 years.  I would think huge amounts of balloons.  Oh, yeah.  Rubber balloons.  Mylar.  Yeah.  Streamers.  Crepe paper.  Sure.  Some crepe paper.  Some breakfast food.  Yeah.  Some birthday cake.  Maybe bagels with candles in them.  Something.  Something festive.  Big signs.  Yeah.  Just a very big party atmosphere.  And the best part is Steve can't go in the studio. 
[00:23:30]  Steve's like all anxious because now he's excited that people are thinking about him.  So he's thinking, I can't wait to see what the guys would do for me.  Yep.  To show their appreciation on my fine birthday.  Thank God the people on PalTalk are able to look in and look behind me and just see how  festive all these decorations are.  They're all over the place.  Well, boy, is he going to be disappointed.  As I look around the studio, first of all, you have to look around a lot just to try to 
[00:24:00]  find something that might be.  You have to look in one direction.  Anywhere else you look, you don't see anything.  Right.  Well.  Oh, no.  You got.  Well, we got one, two, three.  We got four, five.  We got five pointy birthday hats for Steve.  Yay.  We got the worst noisemakers ever that are left over.  One out of ten work.  These are left over from New Year's.  My noisemaker has asthma.  I like the little thing. 
[00:24:30]  There's little sparkly, like little hairs on the end.  They're really cute, like a little New Year's Eve thing.  I think they're three.  There you go.  Don't keep blowing the noisemaker.  Kenny's going to run in here and go, don't waste it.  There's plenty of birthdays that we need this for.  I thought we were going to have to jump out of that line.  Jesus.  Wow.  I almost passed out trying to get noise out of this thing.  I hear this in my head all the time. 
[00:25:00]  Imagine that.  You're just trying to carry on a conversation.  Yeah.  Dude.  When my girlfriend talks, I just see her mouth moving out here.  Dude, that's based on my bit.  What bit?  Remember at FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village?  Bitcourt.  Bitcourt.  No, he knows.  Because we were both doing it.  But after Jimmy's New Year's Eve show, we went to my brother's fine restaurant. 
[00:25:30]  And listeners were coming up, and we all had noisemakers for New Year's.  And they were just babbling.  I love our listeners.  Most of them know that.  But I don't love the ones that talk about the same crap over and over again.  So they're leaning over the table to talk about the same crap.  And actually, they're trying to talk to Jimmy.  Because it was his big night after his big New Year's Eve show.  Yes.  And just as they're leaning in, it's loud in the restaurant to begin with.  And they're leaning in to say something to Jimmy. 
[00:26:00]  Great.  Thank you.  But it really was loud.  And she kept trying to tell me like she enjoyed the show.  And he was probably four inches from her face.  I was really in my eyes with Paris.  And she's thinking, I'm just trying to celebrate New Year's.  She has no idea.  I'm just waiting for her to open her mouth every single time.  Why can't I do this?  You can't blow so hard.  Anyway. 
[00:26:30]  It's a great bit, though.  Unfortunately, you can only break out this bit during New Year's every year.  Or a big birthday party like this.  Yeah, you can't just carry a noisemaker around to make the bit happen.  That's silly.  I do.  You do?  I want to be on the noises like the noisemaker guy on the news.  They always have the special interest stories.  Yeah.  And I'll be the one that brings joy to a small town by blowing my noisemaker all day in the middle of the town square.  Until they kill you.  They come to see him ball.  He's the village noisemaker. 
[00:27:00]  And he's making noise for the people.  A little boy in his noisemaker.  I'm going to stand there on my own waist.  So we've got the pointy hats.  We've got some noisemakers.  You know, a big celebration for Steve.  And then we've got a sign that's draped that says happy birthday.  But you've got to be about 10 feet from it to read it. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, and there's only one.  Because it's a bit tiny.  We have a huge window here in New York City that overlooks Midtown.  And the sign takes up maybe 1 48th of the window.  It's nothing.  It's so tiny.  You don't even know it says happy birthday.  You can't see it.  It gets lost in the window.  So you can't even really see it.  And then, of course, because Steve is bisexual, we've got a...  What?  What are you giving him credit for?  Just figured it was a safe way to say homosexual. 
[00:28:00]  I mean, it's enough.  You know, there are some people that, because of our shenanigans and antics on this very program,  as far as Steve goes, actually think Steve is gay.  Yeah, lucky him.  He doesn't have to try as hard.  They're all just people.  They're all just winking at him.  I've talked to people that actually think Steve is gay.  Yeah, and he's happy because he's bi, so it works out for everybody.  Like boys and men.  Yeah.  Anyway, so we got what?  A blow-up guy doll with a big you-know-what, and there you go. 
[00:28:30]  And what?  Is that a card for Steve?  Yeah, it's a card from the staff.  And you also didn't notice that that happy birthday sign is a Transformers happy birthday sign.  How can you tell?  It's too tiny.  No, I can't see anything.  There's tiny little Transformers.  So let's bring in Steve.  Of course, Steve's not ready to come in, because why would he be?  That would take some thinking.  I'm uploading to Foundry.  Right.  We just talked about it for 20 minutes, and I bet now-  All right, here he is.  Steve.  Upload, scroll, scroll.  Happy birthday.  There it is, Steve.  This is what the guys think of you.  Look it all around.  Isn't that something? 
[00:29:00]  This is basically what the guys think of you.  This is how important you are in their brains.  Yes, I realize.  I was thinking to myself last night, not to make too much of a big deal out of it, but I've had catered breakfasts come in.  I've gotten birthday cakes, personalized birthday cakes for these guys, tranny cakes, whatever works for different people's birthday.  And I thought-  And what I got to give it to Steve, he does make sure he does the right thing.  Yeah.  He caters the free breakfast on Fridays every once in a while, and he does take care of these guys, and he takes them out to lunch every once in a while to tell them they're doing a good job. 
[00:29:30]  And this is what they do in return for your birthday.  Well, I didn't know it was your birthday, honestly.  I didn't know.  No, I-  It's not-  What?  The young Sam?  To be fair, there might be some more stuff at the other studio where we didn't have to worry about cleaning up so quickly.  Oh, okay.  As in, get the interns to get to Dwayne Reed and get some crap done immediately.  Yeah, that's exactly what that means.  Right.  I'm not stupid, Sam.  Where's Steve's cake?  Yeah, where's his cake? 
[00:30:00]  Well, ice cream cake places aren't open this early yet.  Well, why didn't we get it yesterday?  We do have a fridge here.  Because we wanted it to be a super surprise, so it'll be here later.  Good recovery, Sam.  A super surprise.  We can't shake Sam.  No.  And did we get him a little gift from the staff?  What do you think that is?  Is it not free?  It's a card.  No.  It's a blow-up doll.  It's a blow-up doll.  A male.  It's not even like a tranny one.  It's a man blow-up doll, anatomically correct, ready for action, and the card is actually resting on it. 
[00:30:30]  It looks like latke gravis, the hairdo.  What is with the tongue?  Ew, that looks like a clam coming out of the mouth.  Is the tongue something you guys had to put in?  No, that's very special.  It's not a cheap blow-up doll.  It vibrates.  Different parts of it vibrate.  Does it?  You can wear the boa yourself.  You can take the boa off.  Oh, and look.  It's got authentic, what they used to call authentic Greek features.  Oh, look.  It plugs into something. 
[00:31:00]  How do you use the...  I mean, awful.  Can you even say the word?  The awful...  Let's just say the region is awful.  Yeah, the awful hairdo.  Let's just say that.  That oval, it's an oval of hair.  Yeah.  What is the tongue?  What's with the tongue?  How do you use that if there's a tongue there like that?  Yeah, it looks like it's got...  Well, it's the equivalent of a headphone jack for an iPod.  Yeah.  Plugging into its chin.  Okay, so is that just supposed to deliver some type of, I don't know, tongue motion? 
[00:31:30]  I guess.  Because I don't think you could fit anything else in there with that big tongue taking up  all the room.  Sam, did you have to shop for this?  No, well, we sent out Pat Duffy to make sure we found the very best in...  How come blow-up dolls always look like they're singing opera?  Whoa!  Only the best male doll for Steve there.  Yeah, really.  That tongue vibrates.  Yeah, let's plug it in and see it vibrate for Steve. 
[00:32:00]  What do you plug it into?  Yeah, what do you plug it into?  That's what I'm not very clear on.  Maybe you do plug it into an iPod.  I have no idea.  Pat Duffy would have to find the instructions or figure it out himself.  Maybe you do plug it into an iPod and it moves along with whatever music you're listening to.  Oh, wouldn't that be sexy?  No.  It's got a painted mullet, too.  Yeah, it's just awful.  Pat, were you embarrassed to buy this thing?  Yeah, it was the worst store ever.  Wow.  There was buddy booths and it was terrible.  Oh, how long were you in there? 
[00:32:30]  How long were you in the buddy booth trying to hide?  Yeah.  I'm just hiding in here for a while.  Oh, this place is terrible.  Hello?  Hey, yo.  Hey, psst.  Hey, yo.  There's a big battery packet over at the other place that I can go grab it.  Yeah, we want to light this thing up.  Oh, it's a special battery pack, huh?  I'll go grab it.  You got it.  Please.  I hope we all get the news that Steve got electrocuted over the weekend.  Thanks, Steve.  His hiney is singed.  Figured out a new way to remove hair. 
[00:33:00]  We thought it came with a gladiator uniform, too, because there was a gladiator on the box.  Oh, but it didn't.  No.  There's no gladiator uniform.  It's false advertising.  You want a gladiator.  Did it come with the boa?  Or did you have to get the boa?  No, that boa I purchased separately.  You had to purchase.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  Oh, yeah.  This wasn't a free party here.  This stuff was purchased by me and Travis and E-Rock.  Well, thank you, boys.  No wonder everybody thinks I'm gay.  Wow.  I'm getting the feeling that you might be a little disappointed.  No, not at all.  I love being thought of. 
[00:33:30]  Because I remember the other day on the air, you said that you were queer and incompetent.  So I said, let's theme the party around that.  Really?  I can't wait until the incompetence shows up.  Wait, I just did.  I can't disagree with Sam.  Every party needs a little theme.  Yeah, that's a good theme.  A lot of kid parties out there, and they've got to come up with the theme, and we've got  your theme today.  This is the queer and incompetent birthday.  Thank you so much, Sam.  So the incompetent part is the fact that there's barely any decorations in the studio, because  that would be a very incompetent thing to do. 
[00:34:00]  God's sake.  There's nothing.  You couldn't get a few effing balloons blown up?  Yeah, a couple of balloons, maybe.  Maybe a couple streamers that we could hang from the stupid ceiling.  Yeah, make it look festive.  Well, I was told there was a birthday.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  The birthday sign you could barely see.  Yeah, the birthday sign you could barely see.  There's Transformers on that, Steve.  Steve loves Transformers.  I do love Transformers.  I bet you, though.  That would be a happy...  Transform into a woman.  That happy birthday sign would be hanging at a dwarf kid's birthday party. 
[00:34:30]  It's that small.  There might be some balloons at the other place.  All right.  Send the interns out to Dwayne Reed to get balloons.  Steve, while we have you in here, what's going on with the animation contest?  We got a bunch in last night, some really good ones.  I was watching all of them last night.  Funny stuff.  These guys did a great, great job.  Don't forget to check out Be Kind Rewind starring Jack Black.  You name it, we shoot it in theaters today.  And the movie's getting very, very good reviews. 
[00:35:00]  It really is.  Rotten Tomatoes giving it close to 70% positive reviews.  That's good news for Jack Black.  With that said, they sponsored the animation contest.  Right.  They sponsored the animation contest.  It looks like they put all of the entries up last night.  And there were some really funny ones.  Jimmy's glasses was really funny.  Anthony's 1950s nuclear reactor bit was really funny.  And the name one that you mentioned yesterday.  ONA's new names. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's one of my favorites.  Yep.  Although the 50s, what is the 50s?  It's a 50s nuclear power.  The advantages of nuclear power.  Yes.  With Anthony using the old time voice.  Right.  That one's really funny, too.  Using a rolling reactor to make a hole in a mountain.  And then Jimmy's bit that they animated of him getting his glasses taken off his head.  By the tranny.  As he's, yeah, fishing for trannies.  The expression.  It's really funny.  You with the glasses on. 
[00:36:00]  Really funny.  Looks so goddamn funny.  And then when they get taken off, the expression you're making because you can't see.  Like, they have some really talented people doing this animation.  Yeah.  And then Bob Kelly as a really fat cartoon character.  Almost as fat as like Cartman.  Everyone's chosen to make Bob Kelly giant, big, giant, fat guy.  And he's eating.  Eating.  In every single animation.  From people that didn't talk to each other and go, hey, did you make an eating Bob Kelly?  Yeah, and in his, he's talking about how he saw a werewolf in Iraq. 
[00:36:30]  But his character in this animation is just huge.  He's just bloated.  Big fat.  And, uh.  Steve.  What's up?  What's up?  No, I'm just trying to find this.  Yeah, so the animations are up on ondayradio.com.  I think we've got to get a winner today.  And now I've got to tell you, this is why I refuse to listen to program directors.  Ooh.  Until they get somebody that understands how radio shows work, radio show contests work.  Yep. 
[00:37:00]  I will continue to not listen to you people.  And I'm talking for the fans now.  They are so pissed off that this contest was what?  Two weeks?  Two weeks.  Something like two weeks.  Two weeks.  Which just shows you, like, the people that program don't understand what it takes to get a good animation together.  Yeah.  So people have been scrambling for the last two weeks.  And done amazing work.  Yeah, the stuff that came in is absolutely amazing.  But when you do an animation contest, it has to go on for at least a month to two months. 
[00:37:30]  And you would get some amazing, amazing stuff.  Great stuff.  And you would get a lot more entries.  And that's the problem I had with this contest.  Because I'm just starting to get into this animation contest.  Yeah.  And I get the email yesterday, we've got to pick a winner tomorrow.  I'm like, what?  Are you kidding me?  Tomorrow?  Why?  Give these guys another week or two, and we're going to get even better ones, I'm thinking.  Gold.  So we're never going to figure this out.  I'm convinced.  We even mess up an animation contest in the end. 
[00:38:00]  We really do.  Because they think, they're just thinking sales.  They're thinking sales.  Yep.  But they also have to think programming.  But they don't think programming.  Because a real programmer would step in there and go, hey, two weeks for an animation contest,  that's crazy.  I'm amazed that people have come up with such great animations in such a short period of time.  Absolutely.  That one's hysterical.  The new names.  I really like that one.  It's between ONA's new names, which also is on YouTube, by the way, and getting a lot of views. 
[00:38:30]  And 1950's future voice guy.  Yes.  But then Jimmy's glasses is really fine.  That's really good, too.  See, and you can't make it exclusive.  It's really hard to make this stuff exclusive.  What you do, and I was trying to tell people last time, is you let it go on YouTube and stuff,  and you have the station name or the show name.  Wait, these are exclusive to what?  I'm not saying they are or not.  I don't know if they are or not.  As far as I know, and I know nothing. 
[00:39:00]  And I knew nothing.  But right now, they're on the KROQ website, the ONA Radio.  And are they going to get them off YouTube if they end up on YouTube?  Well, a couple of them have landed on YouTube, and they haven't been taken down yet,  so let's hope they can stay up there.  Oh, my God.  I look forward to maybe, you know, I've been doing this since I was 18,  someday actually meeting a program director I respect.  Someday.  Maybe one of these days.  One of these days.  You know, he's not a program director, but I respect that Eric Logan over at XM.  He gets it.  What an awful picture of me. 
[00:39:30]  Huh?  They got you a little card.  What's the card say, Steve?  It's so funny.  There's a little picture in it and everything.  Oh, there's a picture in it.  It says, happy birthday, Steve, from your respectful, loyal, and loving staff.  And they found a picture of me when I was at broadcasting school in New Jersey,  weighing 400 pounds.  Wow!  Yeah.  Yeah.  The clips are moving.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Wow, look at Steve. 
[00:40:00]  Put this on the website.  I'm sure Eric already did.  Very cool.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Holy S.  Fat Bobby Kelly is funny as hell.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Fat Bob Kelly could possibly win this thing, too, man.  So, I don't know.  Who's voting?  And we have to come up with a winner today?  Yeah, we've got to give a winner today.  We all are.  You know what?  We should turn around and just do another animation contest that lasts a while.  Right away.  Back to back.  Get a sponsor.  Get a few thousand dollars and let's do it the right way where this goes on for a while. 
[00:40:30]  Emails have already gone out.  We just started talking about this two days ago.  This is something that slowly develops.  It creates a buzz.  Gives us material for the show.  It also takes the animators a long time to create these things.  I mean, the turnaround time for animators isn't quick to do a really good one.  How long is it, would you say?  It could do three weeks to do a really good one?  It could be up to a month, Jimmy.  Easily.  Because a lot of these guys, you've got to think of the concept, first of all. 
[00:41:00]  You don't just go, oh, I got it.  You have to sit with it for a while and think how you're going to animate all the guys and  stuff and what angle you're going to take.  And then you've got to go to work.  What if the guys at Pixar want to make one?  They've got the other projects, maybe, that they're going to have to put on the back burner  for a couple of weeks and then do the animation for us.  Could we turn around and do this contest right?  You think we could do this?  I'm sure we could.  Who do we talk to around here?  Do we have anybody that is competent that we could actually talk to?  Yeah, we do.  It's hard.  Let me look around. 
[00:41:30]  No.  Not really.  I'm just talking for the listeners because they're bitching and I don't blame them.  You just need more time for this.  You mean like cool from California?  What kind of bitching?  Oh, they are bitching.  Oh, bitching.  Bitch waves.  I got pitted.  Pitted.  You ever see the pitted video?  Slam down.  You ever see the kids talking about being pitted?  No.  Can you get the audio?  It's a very famous video.  I think Sam will find it.  Of course he will.  It's just a California dude and he got crushed by a wave but he calls it pitted. 
[00:42:00]  He got pitted.  Sam wearing that pointy birthday hat, it looks like claymation rocket ship taking off.  His hair is the fire.  You know, Bob Kelly, Fat Bob Kelly might win this thing because now a lot of people in  instant feedback are like, wow, Fat Bob Kelly is really funny.  It's the one where he's with the soldier?  Yeah.  I'm just pointing at him.  He's just a disgusting mess. 
[00:42:30]  He's got his Red Sox sweatshirt on and he is just bloated in cartoon form.  And I'm yelling at him and pointing at him and he's trying to turn his head to see.  And his whole body has to rock back and forth.  He can't really turn around.  It's a great animation.  Oh, it is good.  We got to turn around, Steven.  Do this immediately.  Immediately.  And you know what?  Just start it up.  Start it up Monday or Tuesday.  We don't even know what the prize is going to be.  Put it out.  All right.  Yeah, we can make fun of ourselves.  Like, look, we're stupid. 
[00:43:00]  We know we didn't do this contest right.  So we're doing it again.  Starting immediately.  We'll tell you what the prize is going to be down the road.  Just start animating.  Okay.  And we shouldn't put up a lot more bits for them to choose from.  I just let them take any bit.  Any bit would be nice.  But we should give them, because they can't find it.  Some of these guys can't find this audio.  So we should get a whole bunch of other audio clips up there that they could choose from.  But make it open to any bit.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And we'll do it right.  Yeah.  And we'll pick a winner sometime in like, I don't know, April.  Okay.  Give them a month or two.  And I'm telling you. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Because this is something that would be, just would take on a life of its own.  These contests shouldn't be one, two weeks.  That's insane.  There are people that are working on animations now for this contest that didn't realize, oh  my God, it's over.  Yeah.  So what, they got half an animation thing done.  Well, that's the other reason.  Let them keep going.  Yeah.  Right.  Let them work on it.  So.  And then they go, but why won't you listen to anyone?  Because there's no one to listen to that I respect.  There's no one to listen to.  Give me one person I respect that I'll listen to him.  Trust me.  I had.  I started listening to Logan because I respect the guy. 
[00:44:00]  So it's not, it's not just, I'm a nut case.  Yes, you are for respecting Logan.  Jesus.  As a drunk.  Of course he was.  Wasn't William Holden or Billy Joel available?  He hasn't drank in eight months, fellas.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, good for him.  And lost a lot of weight.  He's like a camel though.  He could live off the booze in his liver.  True.  I don't know that.  True.  So I will listen if I, if I respect the person, but this contest was done very poorly.  I know the sponsor is very happy and we're psyched about the movie Be Kind Rewind starring 
[00:44:30]  Jack Black.  You name it, we shoot it in theaters today.  It's not about that.  No.  It's the programming aspect of this contest that I have a huge problem with.  We'll do another one.  Yeah.  Right away.  Because these guys are like, oh my God, like Hanson, I'm halfway done.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  That was a waste of time.  Let it ride.  Let it ride.  Keep going.  All right.  Bit of good news before we go to break.  Are we going to break or no?  There you go.  Jimmy, what do you got?  I'm very happy.  Larry Davis.  Yes.  What a wonderful bit of news.  How great.  This is justice. 
[00:45:00]  What happened?  In 1986.  Oh, he was a big, big, big famous case.  Larry Davis.  He gained notoriety in 1986 when he shot six cops.  And he was acquitted on attempted murder because he claimed self-defense.  I think Kuntzler, that dirtbag, defended him.  I could be wrong.  But Larry Davis, stabbed to death in prison, he is dead, and it is great.  Good riddance.  And this is even better news.  His brother was interviewed, and he said he talked to his brother just yesterday, the  day before he was stabbed, and he said he was excited over the prospect of a book and 
[00:45:30]  movie deal.  Hey.  Was he?  Oops.  Very exciting.  Oh, well.  Wait a minute.  I'm being shanked.  That's right.  This sucks.  20 years too late, but at least he finally got what he deserved.  Oh, Steve, what do you got?  Steve's got the battery pack.  Well, hey, you don't know how to do radio either.  I got to get rid of everybody.  All right.  Why would you turn the battery on casually as we're going to break?  Wouldn't we want to do the big reveal after we tease these effers for 10 minutes?  No, I honestly wasn't trying to do a reveal. 
[00:46:00]  I was going to use it.  I was going to use it.  Yeah.  You know, we can make gold out of S.  Oh, okay.  I know what that is.  Now, see, I'm thinking too hetero.  What?  What?  I know why that thing has a tongue like that that vibrates.  Why?  It's...  For the chick?  No, no, no.  There's no chick involved in that.  Now, this is something...  That's a BP.  What?  Remember our famous call?  What?  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Let's just say...  A bug box? 
[00:46:30]  A SPAC plug?  Oh, really?  Yeah, that would probably do that if it just vibrates.  Why isn't it...  Why couldn't this be for chicks at a bachelorette party, though?  They got the...  You know, that thing.  Because it's meant to be gay.  They got that thing.  It could be for chicks.  Because it's meant to be gay.  I don't know about that, because that thing could do some damage if she was to, you know...  Do some damage.  But what about the authentic Greek features?  Well, then, that's...  Yeah.  I don't have an answer for that.  That is really just penis. 
[00:47:00]  It doesn't look good.  It's pink sock.  And it doesn't even have fingers.  It's got, like, mitten hands.  Why can't they just...  That thing's awful.  Why can't they figure this out?  I know, like, what, Real Doll does a pretty good job, but in general, these things suck.  Awful.  Real Doll just has the part that you want.  A lot of them just have the part you want, which is just, like, a one-foot section of the body.  Who could have fun with that, laying down on it, just smelling what amounts to a pool liner? 
[00:47:30]  It sounds like you might have a little experience with these things.  I know what they smell like from this goddamn show.  There's always 20 of those things.  Yeah.  I had to throw one away at the house.  What?  I don't know why.  No, it was all boxed up, never used.  It was in plastic, but apparently it found its way from the studio into my house.  What?  Did it walk there?  No, because it was still in the box.  So, what, you thought it was, like, lost DVDs or something? 
[00:48:00]  I think from the bag that I got, why, does Danny know how it got there?  No.  Oh, I see you're laughing.  It's funny.  It is funny.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened, but it got there, and then I had to throw it away, but you can't  just throw it in the garbage.  So, I had to, like, take the box, rip it apart, and shred the box, and then cut the thing  up into pieces and throw it in the garbage.  Wow.  It's very embarrassing trying to throw away a blow-up doll.  Two things.  People are applauding. 
[00:48:30]  My rant about this company and how dumb they are.  They said, you guys took way longer to announce a winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest than  this animation contest.  That was three years it took to announce that one.  I believe it was a three-month contest, which was just amounted to nothing, and this is  actually a really good thing, and we just do it as a throwaway.  All right, 10 days, animation contest, done.  Yeah.  All right, move on.  And the other thing, Steve, I was going to talk to you about this in private, but I want 
[00:49:00]  an animation section on the fine website we cannot promote that is named after our show.  Okay.  I want a link that says Opie and Anthony Animation.  You click on that, and boom, all this stuff is right there for people to check out.  Look at where Steve put the noisemaker on the blow-up doll.  I see that.  They couldn't possibly blow through that noisemaker.  Every time the doll coughs, you're going to hear...  Or like if the doll ate a lot of Mexican food or beans. 
[00:49:30]  Yes.  How's that Metamucil?  That would be really disgusting.  These noisemakers are way too much work.  We're all having problems.  Why is there no cake for Steve?  I don't know.  We're going to figure it all out.  We've got to take a break.  We're late now.  I have to leave early today.  No, you don't.  I do.  No.  I have a long drive.  No.  Leave at 9.  Oh.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll all leave at 9, then.  All right.  If you don't do the show, I don't do the show.  That's how we do it.  That's right. 
[00:50:00]  We have solidarity.  That's right.  Animation link on the website, Steve.  That's what we're going to do now.  Because there's so many Opie and Anthony animations.  They're all over the place, though.  Some are over here.  Some are over there.  Some are on iTunes.  Some are on YouTube.  On break.  Some are on exclusive to onaradio.com, because that makes sense.  So we've got to put them all in one fine place where people go, okay, I want to see some  of this stuff.  Animated.  Click.  There they are.  Thank you very much.  Central location.  Central location.  Right, Anthony.  I like it.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  Exactly.  I'm a bit hyper today.  Holy crap.  I'm going to have a crash later.  Hey, after the break, we've got Driving with Kenny.  Some of the rant that Jimmy did yesterday is so worth replaying.  We'll talk about the dumb debate last night.  Lost was last night.  Yes, yeah.  So we've got the Lost production piece that the boys put together, which is pretty funny.  We've got your Black History nominee on the way.  Some more Oscar moments.  Wow, busy.  And other things.  Opie and Anthony.  This Saturday, February 23rd. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  You're immobilized, man.  You can't move.  What?  Can you get an erection?  You can't even put a sock on, man.  I can't do that now.  Can I get an erection?  The Laszlo Show.  He's going to let you know right up front, I have an Asian fetish, and I would fuck a radioactive plant.  The Laszlo Show.  This Saturday, February 23rd, 9 Eastern on XM 202.  How long did that last?  I don't know.  And then I bought a Corvette and got a divorce.  It was a fucking scene, dude.  The Virus. 
[00:51:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  Hang in there.  Morning.  I guess today we're definitely talking to New York especially because it's a crappy day out there.  It's just crappy.  It's a bunch of crap.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Got a bunch of things to play.  What, Jimmy?  That's what the bench drumming to be tonight.  I have to leave at 9 if possible.  The Albany Egg.  I'm so sick of saying it.  If you want to come, come.  If not, you're missing nothing.  No, I'm kidding. 
[00:52:00]  518-473-1845 tonight in Albany at the Egg.  I'm driving.  It's probably going to take me five hours to get up there.  Oh, my God.  Efforts better show up.  Yeah, at least five hours.  I would say at least.  You think so?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be seven hours.  Speaking of...  I'm sorry.  Yeah, speaking of driving, we should get right into it then because, you know, Jimmy's leaving  at 9 to drive with Kenny, and we kind of brought this up late yesterday, and Jimmy went off  on a rant on Kenny's driving.  Oh, it's awful.  This is so worth playing. 
[00:52:30]  It's a quickie.  You better prepare for a lot of snow, GH.  His job is to bring misery and unhappiness, and he's amazing at it.  The interior's tan.  That's an uplifting color.  How about Mental Institution Green?  Were they out of that?  You couldn't get the black interior?  Could you make it so whenever it rains, they look like tears?  He doesn't understand what colors could do for a person.  He refuses to beep his s*** horn.  Oh, that is the worst.  His OCD, he's only got 500 beeps in the thing, and he always keeps the windshield wipers 
[00:53:00]  until you literally can't see four.  Hey, s***, we driving underwater, or are you being a chiseler with s*** in your eyes?  He's s***ing me.  He's like driving out of SeaWorld.  It's amazing.  I've never driven with him.  He doesn't beep his horn?  No, dude, you got to drive with Kenny because he could kill 99.99% of the people that are on  the roads, and he lets everyone just abuse the s*** out of him. 
[00:53:30]  They cut him off, little tiny little old ladies are cutting him off.  And he doesn't f*** beep, and he's like, oh, look at this.  I'm like, look at this, I'm like, what am I going to do?  Yeah, well, what am I, yeah.  How about beeping?  He doesn't beep in the case of emergencies.  He's awful.  And I hate the way he's saving the electricity in his car.  But he literally will be like, you have to actually lean over and go, how about f***  hitting the switch so we can look out in front of us and see if anything has stopped?  I f***ing hate your chiseling with the f***ing windshield wiper distribution. 
[00:54:00]  Just turn it on.  He doesn't want to use it.  Is it the electricity or the wiper blades?  Whatever, stop saving everything.  When he dies, I hope they put him in a coffin with two fresh wiper blades and an unused horn.  Like a pharaoh.  I could use these in the afterlife.  And enough with your f***ing invoices.  Just round it off.  And how about...  He sends invoices every month because he buys breakfast and stuff, and you're like, 75 cents 
[00:54:30]  for a cup of coffee, 87 cents for a yogurt.  I mean, just the dumbest s***.  He's like Scientology.  He just buries you in paperwork.  There you go.  We're potty mouths the next time.  Oh my God.  I was laughing at the beeps.  Well, yeah.  What a lot...  We are just curse-filled jackasses.  I don't realize it.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  You don't realize it until you listen back and hear the beeps that...  Yeah.  Boy, we do do a lot of cursing, don't we?  Let's say hi to Sylvia in New Jersey.  Sylvia, what's up? 
[00:55:00]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Sylvia.  I just wanted to compliment...  Well, not compliment, but talk about the whole two weeks for an animation.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a load of bull.  I mean, speaking as an animator myself, it takes more than two weeks to produce something  good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We kind of went off on a rant a little while ago about it.  This is what we're going to do.  We have to announce the winner of the latest animation contest, but we're going to start  this up right away starting next week. 
[00:55:30]  We don't even know what the prize is yet.  We don't know who the sponsor is going to be.  We don't care.  We've got to think about the radio show first, and this is great for the radio show.  So we're going to go right into the next contest next week.  We'll have more details.  I have a prize idea.  Yeah, what?  If you do all these animations, you will win perhaps a Jim Norton CD and a wow sticker.  Wow.  All right, there you go.  There's the prize so far.  We'll add to it.  Funny, like five animations.  They're all drawn in notebook paper.  You have to just turn really quickly.  Also, we'll get an autographed windshield wiper blade from Club Soda Candy because he's not 
[00:56:00]  using it.  Even his autograph sucks.  He signs it.  He can't write cursive because he's only in his mid-50s.  So he writes, what's it called?  It's called script.  He writes regular.  Oh, regular block letters?  He signs it clubby.  C-L-U-B-B-Y.  Yeah, clubby.  You know what it's called?  It's called the preschool font.  It's amazing.  Block letters.  I used to carry a gun for a living.  C-L-U-B-B-Y.  I'm a lefty. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  So it's very awkward.  Yeah.  So animation contest is going to start up again next week.  And we're going to give it at least, what day we have to?  Oh, my mom's birthday tomorrow.  Happy birthday, mom.  February 22nd or whatever, 23rd?  23rd.  Well, today's the 22nd.  So at least till April 1st.  I say December 8th.  At least April.  Maybe two solid months.  So maybe mid-April, somewhere around there, okay?  But we've got to do this thing right because it's great for the radio show.  All right.  Hey, it's also Steve's birthday, so Tim is hard at work in the studio down the hall. 
[00:57:00]  And I play this because I just know in my head that it annoys the hell out of Jimmy,  and that's what makes me laugh really hard.  I just find Tim now to be a celebrity to me.  I hear the voice that he puts on with his many voices, and I look at him in a whole new light.  He's a celebrity.  Yeah.  That voice. 
[00:57:30]  People commenting on that clip that had a lot of beeps in it.  Some guy, because he didn't leave his name, he writes,  Why is my radio transmitting more so?  I know.  Everything.  Do we really need to drop the F-bomb before we say any word?  Yeah.  Or just peppering our language.  Pepper.  Here we go.  So this is Tim's gang that live in his head, wishing Steve a very happy birthday.  Happy birthday, Steve!  Happy birthday, Steve! 
[00:58:00]  Oh, no, it's Steve's birthday!  Happy birthday, Steve!  It's Steve's birthday.  Yes, it's Steve's birthday.  Radio for the rest of us.  It's Steve's birthday!  How old are you now?  Hello!  It's Steve's birthday.  Happy birthday to you!  And many more!  Okay!  That's right, Cleveland, that's what you've been missing live. 
[00:58:30]  How horrible is that?  Happy birthday!  Dang!  Oh, it's awful.  That voice.  It's great.  No redeeming social value.  None!  No, no.  Uh, all right.  Yeah, good morning to Cleveland.  They're already predicting that we're not going to last long in mornings.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  Some dope in the newspaper in Cleveland.  Screw you!  Well, we should talk to them.  Ah, I don't know.  Google our names.  Throws a couple stabs in there. 
[00:59:00]  Why?  We're doing very well in Cleveland.  And then, uh, dumb Maxwell's taking shots at us.  Of course he is.  And?  And now praising Rover, because he's going to be working with Rover.  It's like...  Is he really praising Rover now?  Yeah.  It's like, do you have any...  But...  Do you understand, like...  But they were...  They were enemies, right?  And...  If someone could come to...  I'd love to hear Maxwell praising Rover after he just beat him.  Hey, look, we're on the same team now!  Right.  We all do, but it's like, you know, I just admit you do it.  Yeah.  I had a bunch of scums. 
[00:59:30]  A whole lot of them.  I hope he dies of sleep apnea.  Who?  Maxwell.  I like Rover.  Stupid Maxwell.  Yeah, I mean...  We had no problems with Rover, you know?  He'll probably turn around and bash us, because that's, I guess, what you gotta do after you...  After you leave, uh, the same team.  Like I always say, your enemies become your friends, your friends become your enemies.  It's just how it works in radio.  It's so stupid.  I don't know if he will...  It's completely stupid.  I hope not.  I hope he takes the high road, because he knows...  Well, it went damn well.  We never had a problem with him.  Yeah.  So don't even...  Whatever.  Won't start anything. 
[01:00:00]  We take on all challengers.  What was I gonna say?  Oh, Gene Simmons.  So, uh, the tape is real.  Yeah, the sex tape.  Sex tape is real, and, uh...  Ugh.  The famous cease and desist has been...  The C and D.  The C and D has been given out.  Yep.  And what good does that do?  It's already been out.  We were lucky enough to see the tape, and we made our own copies, and we're enjoying it.  And, uh, they are for sale, and, uh, Fountain...  No, they...  There is one line in this legal thing, by the way.  Huh. 
[01:00:30]  Accordingly, Mr. Simmons and allied industries collectively control all rights in and to the  video...  Ah.  ...and demand that ValleyWagon.com cease and desist all streaming, exhibition, exploitation,  blah, blah, blah.  So Gene owns part of the rights to that video.  I think what happened is she probably taped it illegally...  Uh-huh.  ...and then, um, told him, and he might have made a deal, like, we're gonna...  Gene figured out a way to make money off of it.  That's what he did.  Yeah, sure.  The only one in history that could actually do that.  By the way, if you had 15, you won the pool.  15, uh, beeps in that, uh... 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  ...that Kenny bit.  Jesus.  Oh, that's...  Right there.  Stop it right there.  Wow.  Let's just say she's lying on her stomach, and, uh, Gene's whispering in her ear.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  With the wig.  I didn't even get a really good up-close view of that whole mess.  Gene Simmons, oh, that...  Gene Simmons in his wig still has a t-shirt on, and I think he's still wearing socks.  Pants are still on.  Oh, that's his pants.  He's looking around in the back, shuffling to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Shuffling to the bathroom. 
[01:01:30]  That's hilarious.  What's wrong with him?  Can someone tell me who this nerd on CNN is?  He's the nerdiest person I've ever seen.  Oh.  He's talking about the election.  He's talking about McCain's affair, or a legend affair.  But the media's not biased.  You know, he announces his candidacy, or they give him the nomination, and we're 30 minutes  later, the story's out.  Yeah, the story's come out.  It's only Fox that's biased.  You know what?  But no one really cares.  It's already going away, it seems.  No.  His wife looks like the Pope.  How can McCain not cheat?  Look at his wife. 
[01:02:00]  She looks like the new Pope.  He has to.  She looks like she has nice eyes.  That's about it.  She's awful.  Picture McCain's wife in the Pope hat.  She's creepy.  People are basically looking at McCain going, oh.  Give the fella a break.  Give him a little break.  He's tortured me.  Could you?  Probably didn't mean to have an affair.  He's trying to raise his arms over his head, and they just hit a woman's breast and photographed  it.  Oh.  How does he shampoo his hair?  Exactly.  He probably has to take the soap and throw it up and then move his head into it. 
[01:02:30]  Leave him alone.  Poor guy.  Yeah, absolutely.  Tortured.  Well, it's time for everyone's favorite part of the radio show.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Hold on.  I love this.  Sing along.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand.  Yeah.  Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State.  She's gonna do it.  Give her just a chance.  She'll make it.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's gonna be your president, Hillary Clinton.  Nothing's gonna turn her back now.  Straight ahead and on the track now.  Oh.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  I bet she thought she was doing such a great job.  Yeah.  There is nothing she can do.  Da-da.  Never heard the word impossible.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Did you see that jerk?  It sucks.  It sucks.  It sucks.  It's a place to make our dreams come true.  Oh.  Working for us all day.  Yes.  All day.  Make all our dreams come true.  Working for us all day.  Yes.  All day.  Make all our dreams come true. 
[01:04:00]  Working for us all day.  Do you really think so?  For me and you.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Wow.  Working for us all day.  Do you think she's gonna be working for you all day?  No.  Not at all.  No.  No.  It just fit into the song, man.  Chill out, man.  She'll be looking through Playgirl magazines, cutting like the penises off and then stepping  on them.  All day long.  That's working for us all day. 
[01:04:30]  She'll just cut the genitals of the men off and she squashes them with her shoes.  Stinks all day.  She'll have a mullet all day.  Big stupid donkey teeth.  It's awful.  She should be a Democrat.  She looks like the stupid symbol they have.  Donkey teeth.  Rotten husband of hers, too.  Snapping every 30 seconds.  Fat legs.  Oh, they're just a graceless couple.  I want to be president.  It's her turn.  You think she's gonna be president? 
[01:05:00]  She could be president.  I don't think a woman could be president.  Well, I don't know about that.  Damn.  Damn.  He rules.  He rules, man.  If we never hear any of that again, it'll be so soon.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but that's why it'll continue with this show.  Because of you, Jimmy.  I love it.  Because we were ready to turn the corner and go, wow, this really stinks.  But then I started realizing that it was annoying, Jimmy.  So I'm like, we've got to make more of these. 
[01:05:30]  It doesn't annoy me.  I think it's really good.  No, I'm not buying it, Jimmy.  Anyway, the Hillary Obama reality show was a bust last night.  Kind of a bummer.  They were expecting like a big debate, fireworks.  Yep.  And Obama had a cold, I guess.  He's still fighting a cold.  Is he?  And it was like whatever stuff, really.  Yeah.  We got two quick clips.  These are the highlights and that's it.  Really.  This is it.  I'm going to guess this.  She has to be careful because she can't do anything that would completely kick her out 
[01:06:00]  of the race.  No.  Because she's still in it, obviously.  And she probably doesn't want to make a critical error.  And he probably doesn't want to screw up and leave like status quo.  Why should she take this ground?  I was reading.  Pretty much what they did.  I was reading a bunch of articles and they were saying that Obama could kind of sit back  a little bit right now.  You know, he doesn't have to prove too much at this juncture.  Pace himself.  But I think Hillary really needs to like, you know, she's got to deliver a knockout punch  or this thing is over.  He's won 11 straight states.  Oh, yeah.  Just kicking ass.  And then he won the overseas delegates.  I'm learning about overseas delegates now or something like that. 
[01:06:30]  Why can they vote?  Living abroad.  Thank you.  Obama wins.  Votes from Democrats living abroad.  So he's won that one, too.  But this is two quick clips.  You've got Hillary taking a jab at Obama's plagiarism here.  If your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words.  That's, I think, a very simple proposition.  And, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can 
[01:07:00]  believe in.  It's change you can Xerox.  Who wrote that for her?  You know, it's annoying.  She didn't write that.  I got this.  Oh, that'll be funny.  She's got a comedian to write that for her.  Xerox.  It's just irritating.  Here is this.  It's so irrelevant if it's his.  Who cares if it's his words, you dummy?  It's like, it matters is like what he's going to do as president.  Like, it's amazing how no one is harping on the fact that she stayed with a guy who  humiliated her in front of the whole country.  Yeah.  I mean, if you want to wordplay like that, let's wordplay. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  How about your husband's words?  I did not do that.  And you stayed with him.  And now he's campaigning for it.  You want to get into it.  Why doesn't somebody just attack her horribly?  Yeah, they never do.  Yeah.  They never go for the big attack like that.  Why are they so afraid to mention the obvious?  Yeah.  And they don't even talk about the real issues.  Your husband made a fool of you.  He made a fool of you and you stayed.  And meanwhile, you're the symbol of feminism.  Yeah.  And you allowed yourself to be humiliated time and time again. 
[01:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  You were phony.  Shut up.  Victimized.  God, I mean, so what if he took a...  Who cares?  Yeah.  God almighty, he's irritating.  Took a few liberties with some of the female staff.  She's a political hack.  Who cares if Obama stole some words from him speaking?  I like Anthony's point, too.  What year is this?  Making a Xerox joke?  Yeah.  What?  Xerox.  Xerox.  Who the hell calls it a Xerox anyway?  Could you run me off a mimeo?  I need a mimeograph. 
[01:08:30]  What were the...  What were the stuff that we used to smell in school?  What were those called?  Mimeographs?  Dittos.  Dittos, yeah.  Seats.  And then Obama responds to that little jab.  With this...  Obama responds to this little jab, to her little jab.  Now, the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs  who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly. 
[01:09:00]  This is where we start getting into silly season in politics, and I think people...  Is it already silly season?  He's sounding more and more like The Rock, too.  The Rock says it's silly season.  Right.  Silly season.  He sounds like The Rock, doesn't he?  The Rock is going to be president.  Is he going to pose his face by the podium?  Yeah.  Put the people's eyebrow up?  That is what he should be doing, though.  Just trivialize this dumbbell trying to grab on anything. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, she sickens me.  Good for him.  Mm-hmm.  Silly season.  Let's say hi to Crystal in Aquino, Ohio.  Silly.  Hi.  Are you a pretty Crystal or an ugly Crystal?  I'd like to think I'm a pretty Crystal.  Donna wants to know.  Yeah, because if you're named Crystal, you've got to be hot.  Or your parents did you a serious injustice.  Crystal.  What's up, Crystal?  I've been told I'm pretty hot, so...  All right, good.  Cool.  I just wanted to tell you guys how awesome it is to have you live again in Cleveland. 
[01:10:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  We feel awesome being live in Cleveland.  I've got to be honest, I don't know if the station feels the same way, because we haven't  heard from them yet.  I thought that would be the first call.  Very excited to have you guys live at our station in Cleveland.  This is so weird.  Yeah, all right.  That's a good sign.  Because we're ecstatic.  We're beyond happy to be live in Cleveland.  I can't even tell you.  Because back in the day, we were live, and we got a lot of interaction from our Cleveland  listeners.  Yes. 
[01:10:30]  And we made sure we stopped there for the virus tour.  And I've been up there a couple times, a few times with Jimmy.  When he was doing his thing, so.  We're actually going to go see Jimmy on the 29th.  Oh, nice.  Thank you for that.  See you, my boyfriend.  Very cool.  Thank you.  All right, Crystal.  Thank you.  Bye.  We just used you to make ourselves feel better.  Thank you.  How about ourselves?  We're hosting a private semi-pro screening Tuesday at AMC Empire.  That's 234 West 42nd Street in Manhattan at 11 a.m. this coming Tuesday. 
[01:11:00]  The first 75 people will get to attend the screening and get a free corn dog.  First come, first serve.  Yeah, so line up.  I picture probably five blocks of people lined up going, I hope they don't run out of corn  dogs.  The semi-pro movie looks really good.  Will Ferrell looks hilarious in the trailer.  Yeah.  I guess there's a scene with a corn dog, right?  It must be a tie-in.  Yeah, there's got to be some tie-in. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  So we're giving out free corn dogs.  That's great.  It's going to be a fun time.  Is anybody programming this station?  Seriously.  We should give them out like Steve gave that blow-up doll a noisemaker.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  A little bit can eat theirs first.  That way wins.  An animation contest that lasts two weeks and free corn dogs for the listener at point.  Yeah.  We're setting the radio world on fire, everybody.  We should at least set the studio on fire. 
[01:12:00]  And punt.  Are we broadcasting from Des Moines, Iowa?  This is New York City, for God's sakes.  Number one market in the country, so I hear.  Yeah.  First come, first serve for the corn dogs.  Love Caddyshack.  Semi-pro starring Will Ferrell.  Putting the funk into the Dunkin' Theater is what, next Friday?  And of course that means we're going to have Will Ferrell on the show, right?  No.  No?  No.  How do we know?  Why don't we get him in? 
[01:12:30]  I'm sure he would have fun here.  We've had him on the show before.  Yeah.  I know, Will.  I'll see if I can get that.  Oh, well, do you?  I'll tell you.  We did a little acting together, yeah.  Oh.  Did you really?  Yeah, on Tough Crowd.  We did a sketch.  Oh, I remember that now.  Yes.  I don't remember that, Jimmy.  I have audio, but I'll bring it in if you want on Monday.  I would love to hear that.  I don't remember you doing something with Will Ferrell.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll bring in that.  I'll bring in me and Carlin acting together.  All right.  Whatever you want.  Stop bragging.  All right.  You're right.  Carlin.  Well, we did a sketch together.  I remember that.  I'm an elf hat.  Yes.  Me and Colin played lawyers, and it was an over-the-top, really badly, on-purpose named, 
[01:13:00]  and we were doing dramatic lawyer talk.  Yeah.  And he goes, my partner, Marv Gresto.  That was my name in the sketch, Marv Gresto.  Colin's the master of awful names.  Marv Gresto.  And I forget what Will's name was.  It was like some awful, he was like the big lawyer that was going to save the case, and  it was like Pete Jack.  It was some hack, just no name.  Marv Gresto.  Marv Gresto was my favorite name. 
[01:13:30]  I wish I'd thought of that.  That is a good one.  Every role I played would be Marv Gresto for the rest of my career.  Colin.  Let's go to Andrew in Grand Rapids.  Andrew.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that we never hear you guys mention Grand Rapids, Michigan.  We love you out here at 1073 KLQ Grand Rapids.  Thank you.  I hope you guys hit Grand Rapids, the virus tour.  Michigan, somewhere in Michigan, I'd come see you guys in a heartbeat.  Damn.  Let me tell you something about Grand Rapids, Michigan.  This is why we don't talk about you guys, because you're lucky to have us. 
[01:14:00]  Whoa.  Easy.  You are lucky to have this fine radio show.  Full statement.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course you are.  I'll be out there April 12th, though, in Detroit, so if it's not too far, take a little flight  if you want.  If not, then don't call us.  You are everywhere.  I work all over the town.  I'm spreading the word.  And I love you anyway.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  The whole country is your stage.  Let's go to Long Island.  John, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I just want to know where I can get that song.  And I really, really love it a lot. 
[01:14:30]  Pray for me.  Oh, the Hillary song?  Do you really like it?  I don't even know.  Oh, he's gone.  No, he doesn't want it.  You can't really.  Why would you download that song?  Well, I'd say what you can get is you put on headphones and then you nosedive into an  outhouse.  Fish around on the bottom of your teeth.  You'll find it.  It's a better experience than listening to it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  Good news.  Well, I guess the Hillary song would be up on onaradio.com, right?  Yeah.  It's got to be.  Steven S. from Bayshore, right? 
[01:15:00]  We're linking that song, hopefully.  We'll throw it up there.  onaradio.com.  And it should be on the website that we can't promote that's named after this show.  And the reason we can't promote that because there might be some nude girls on our website,  which, God forbid,  you know, people see that.  Yuck.  Black History Month.  Here's today's honoree as we go to break.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes,  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the 
[01:15:30]  melting pot.  It is today.  Today, we honor Edward Sewer for his role as Maasai in the cult classic The Warriors.  Who are the warriors?  Stay tuned for more icons of black history.  Riff!  Yeah, right!  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial. 
[01:16:00]  Barack is name of the year according to baby name wizard.  The year is young and we're in February.  What else is going on in the world today?  Study concludes some women do not have G-spots.  What do you think of that, Jimmy?  Not every woman has a G-spot.  Good.  I want to date them.  Less pressure.  Not my fault you're genetically screwed up. 
[01:16:30]  Really?  That's what they're saying today, Anthony.  I think they're called frigid.  They're frigid.  Have you heard of a frigid woman?  Yeah, of course.  They don't like sex.  I wrecked this girl in college.  You mean you wrecked her?  I really did.  Because that's usually the same for I wrecked her.  Well, I had this friend, Jambo.  Yeah.  He lives in San Francisco.  Really good friend of mine. 
[01:17:00]  We were sitting around one day and like, we're just kids.  We're 18 years old and all of a sudden we're learning about the G-spot for the first time.  Because one guy has to go, dude, the G-spot.  It's this amazing thing in women and if you find it like other, I can't say what I want to say.  But basically, it's pretty exciting for everybody involved.  Right.  And you might need a mop.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:17:30]  It's been happening all morning.  It just keeps going.  I don't know why.  It keeps going and going.  There's a button on there that will just stop after the track is played instead of the repeat.  I don't know which one it is.  And I think I might have wrecked this girl because I decided that I needed to find the G-spot.  Oh.  Well, we have to do my own.  Looking with a shovel?  Well, let's just put it this way.  That's when I learned that it would be smart to keep your hands well-groomed. 
[01:18:00]  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, God.  I think I was doing a Freddy Krueger.  Oh.  I didn't know I was doing a Freddy Krueger.  There was some screaming that was involved that had nothing to do with possibly calling cops or anything,  but just some screams because, oh, my God, what is this?  You thought you were doing great, but then it just turns out there's a lot of evidence under your fingernails?  It was just... 
[01:18:30]  That's, like, very important to me.  Huh?  I do not like...  Well, it's important to every guy, but...  No, it's obviously not if you look at some people.  When you were 18, I didn't know.  You've got to keep everything clipped and nice.  People sometimes don't do that.  They don't clip.  I don't like it even a little bit.  I've probably bought 8,000 nail clippers because I'll look and go, like,  I'm not too long right now.  I've got to clip right now.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  It's like a pet peeve of mine.  Really got to clip.  Oh, got to, got to, got to clip.  I sound crazy.  No.  No, not at all.  Good.  You should be the Hughes in this thing.  Oh.  All right, I was, I just took my shoes off because I thought I could gross it out, but...  My nails are getting a little long.  Oh, God, that's another thing.  Just a little bit.  You should never have long toenails.  They're starting to curl underneath.  Oh, God damn it. 
[01:19:30]  Just a little.  Clip them.  Oh.  I forget.  I bite my toenails.  Forget.  Do you really?  You look at them when you go in the shower.  I don't look down at my feet.  I told you.  I don't like feet.  I don't like my feet.  I don't like anyone else's feet.  Well, when you're in the shower, it's part of you.  You got to wash it and crap.  Well, every once in a while, I'll notice, wow, okay, they're getting a little long, and  then I clip them, but then I clip them too short, and then I have to walk around weird  because it hurts.  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  You're like a child.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, just figuring that out.  Let's say hi to Brad in Kentucky.  Brad.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  What's up, Brad?  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you very much, Bradley.  Hey, so how come you guys aren't on any radio stations in Kentucky?  Well, because you guys wear weird hats.  And those big belt buckles.  Yeah, we're scared of you and your weird hats on Kentucky Derby Day.  Oh, the bonnets. 
[01:20:30]  Whatever they are.  I don't know.  I don't think Kentucky can handle this radio show.  Oh, man.  All my friends, let's see you next time, guys.  Oh, thank you, Brad.  We appreciate that.  That's a pick-up.  All right.  Lost was on last night, huh?  Yes, indeed.  Yeah.  It was.  I won't say anything.  I'm not a spoiler.  But a couple of surprises, as usual, on the show.  The show's just full of mystery and surprise.  What was the name of the guy that died? 
[01:21:00]  I, uh, there was no, uh, no, no, no, no, no.  Look, Jimmy's getting, he's taking his headphones off.  He, uh, no.  I don't know.  I was, see, I knew that would panic people.  I don't know if anyone died on Lost.  I don't watch Lost.  I know who died.  Actually, someone did die on Lost.  Marv Gresto.  Wasn't he a lawyer?  Yes, he was a lawyer on Lost.  He had a suit on the beach.  And, uh, a meteor killed him.  Or should have, at least. 
[01:21:30]  Uh, the egg in Albany.  Jim Norton.  Yeah, tonight, if I make it.  Six hour and 55 minute, uh, flight to Lazor Newark.  Yeah, well, you're not flying to Albany.  No, no, but I'm saying it's amazing that they would actually make 55, instead of just saying  seven hours.  Seven hours, yeah.  Because I'm sure it's going to be on 55.  Oh, people have got to be losing their minds at the airports.  You just got to cancel your flight.  I mean, uh.  Yeah.  Sure.  Luckily, I'm not, uh.  Flying out.  Right.  That would suck.  Oh, boy.  Big time.  Mm-hmm.  Anyway, the only reason I said you, uh, watch Lost, because I want to play this thing again. 
[01:22:00]  Oh.  You being a Lost fan boy.  Yeah.  Well, I get very excited.  And it was fun watching, uh, Lost last night, after having seen two of the big stars of the  show on our very program, and being able to talk to them, uh, and interview them, although  some people didn't call it an interview.  Uh, they called it an Anthony monologue with a star sitting there.  And, uh, I resent that.  Wow.  Because I think I had a fine interview with, uh, both of the stars. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, this sounded fine.  And, uh, once again, uh, listen really closely as Jimmy's attempting to, you know, do the  plug and tell people when Lost is on, but even Anthony can't allow that.  I was too excited, and I had to jump in and steal the plug from Jimmy.  It's all about Anthony and his love for the, uh, the Lost characters.  Yes.  Previously on Lost.  Ben from Lost, of course, and, uh, great to have you here.  Huge fan of the show.  Like I've said, as is everybody.  Thanks.  It is one of the most talked about shows. 
[01:23:00]  Uh, there aren't many shows like that.  You gotta be really proud to be on a successful show.  Did you see the potential for this?  Did you know you were gonna be on the show?  Any part of that Ben character in you?  It's very difficult.  That's an interesting character.  Five times you say the word show.  Show, show, show.  Did you know you were gonna be on the show?  On the show, show.  Did you have a dress? 
[01:23:30]  Did you wear a dress?  Where was it?  Was it a mall?  You were in a dress?  Something about a dress?  How was the show now?  Show.  It was a good show.  I like the show.  Really big shoe.  You enjoy watching Mr. Show.  Did you know you'd be on the show?  It's a really good show.  It's such a popular show.  How'd you get on the show?  I love watching the show.  Do you enjoy watching?  All right.  Enough about the show.  Enough about the show.  Let's go to Andy in Cleveland.  Lots of calls starting to come in from Cleveland now that we're live.  What's up, Andy?  Yes, welcome, Cleveland. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Welcome to Cleveland.  Thank you.  Well, we've been on a while, but I guess you guys didn't notice.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, no, I'm serious.  I loved you guys.  When you were in Cleveland before live, you were the best.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Well, we were in afternoons for a while on tape delay, but no one wanted to acknowledge  that, I guess.  Now they're going to acknowledge it because we're live.  Well, I listened to you on afternoons.  I was hardcore.  All right.  What's up, Andy?  I want to call Anthony a psycho curmudgeon.  Oh.  Why?  Because he just babbles on incoherently about everything. 
[01:24:30]  I think I'm very coherent.  Listen, just listen to him, and he's losing his mind.  I'm very coherent, sir.  No, you're not.  No, you need, like, serious help.  I'm concerned for you.  I am.  I thought I was making sense when I spoke.  I've got to be honest.  I'm not concerned because it makes for great radio.  That's all I care about.  As long as the radio sounds good.  Right.  Who cares about my mental state, right?  What were you missing last night in your big house? 
[01:25:00]  Let me think, because I know there was something.  Every day this week, you've been telling people what you've been missing.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I look around, and I'm like, hmm.  And I start realizing, like, I'm going to have to start buying stuff.  Yeah.  Toilet paper.  Why would you be missing toilet paper?  I don't know, but I went under the sink to replace a roll, and there was one roll left. 
[01:25:30]  Okay.  But then I realized, now I've got to get more toilet paper.  Okay.  And I've got to get it.  Well, that's what people do.  No, for some reason, the past few years, it was just there.  It was on the roll.  It was right there on the roll.  So what would change that you now have to get toilet paper?  The fact that it's just not just on the roll anymore.  So what, Fresh Direct doesn't deliver anymore?  Well, no, they haven't. 
[01:26:00]  I'm going to have to figure out how to get in touch with them so they can deliver it.  But they used to deliver it for you.  Yes.  You might actually have to go get toilet paper.  That could shut down your brain.  Although the Mexican maids did show up yesterday.  All right, that's good.  Which was nice.  So that's still happening.  That's what's nice.  Yeah.  But the head maid there, the one that speaks English, she had a lot of questions for me.  Really?  A lot of questions.  Like what?  She was just wondering, as she's cleaning each room, how come maybe there wasn't as much 
[01:26:30]  stuff to have to clean around?  Hey, remember earlier we were talking about getting pitted?  Yes.  Yeah.  Why don't we move on?  Yeah.  Just a little piece of the puzzle today.  Interesting.  Why don't we move on?  I referred to a video clip that is a video internet phenomenon about being pitted.  And I was very, very surprised that none of you guys have heard this before or seen this 
[01:27:00]  video.  This was a biggie.  I got to thank AJ, part of the Philly crew, for turning me on to this clip about four or  five months ago.  I should have brought it to the show.  I failed you.  I failed you guys.  This is a surfer dude.  He's on Good Day LA.  It's kind of like, I guess, the Regis of LA.  Yeah.  Jesus, really?  Yeah.  A little like kind of Regis show.  And they're talking about the surfer dude because the surfing...  Oh, they were surfing in the flooded park or something? 
[01:27:30]  How do you do that?  So they're having an interview with a surfer.  And listen to this kid, man.  Listen to this.  But the park is still flooded.  So you'll see kids out there again today.  Some of those kids today will be my co-hosts.  Just like, dude, you got the best barrels ever, dude.  Just like, you pull in and you just get spit right out of them.  And you just drop in and just smack the lip.  Hoopah!  Drop down.  Snap.  Bah!  And then after that, you just drop in, just ride the barrel and get pitted.  So pitted like that.  Me and Mech are going to wing on over London and jam with the stones. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, bud.  Let's party.  Wait, let me do it again.  The park is still flooded.  So you'll see kids out there again today.  Some of those kids today will be my co-hosts.  It's just like, dude, you got the best barrels ever, dude.  Just like, you pull in and you just get spit right out of them.  And you just drop in and just smack the lip.  Hoopah!  Drop down.  Snap.  And then after that, you just drop in, just ride the barrel and get pitted. 
[01:28:30]  So pitted like that.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  Listen up.  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted.  Relax, all right?  No, man.  It's a television repairman.  Got this ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, those guys are back!  You dick! 
[01:29:00]  I love that.  And, of course, this is great iced tea.  This is great iced tea.  As if you didn't even take a sip.  Yeah.  No, he never drinks the iced tea.  Yeah.  But he holds the glass up, tips it toward where she eats in another room and just goes, hey,  this is great iced tea.  Yeah.  Before he bangs her in the cabana.  That takes two seconds.  Old Damone.  How great is this kid? 
[01:29:30]  And I got to acknowledge, this clip is really old.  I'm surprised we never played it on our show.  The pitted clip.  Pitted.  How's this guy ever going to get a job?  Pitted.  You want to hear it one more time?  Yeah, why not?  The park is still flooded, so you'll see kids out there again today.  Some of those kids today will be my co-hosts.  It's just like, dude, you got the best barrels ever, dude.  It's just like, you pull in, and you just get spit right out of them, and you just drop  in and just smack the lip, hold back, drop down, snap, and then after that, you just drop 
[01:30:00]  in, just ride the barrel and get pitted, so pitted, like that.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  You've got to see the video, Tim.  Oh, Debbie.  What does pitted mean?  I guess it's just planted.  Yeah, you just get planted into the sand.  Wham, into the sand.  Pitted, so pitted.  Yo.  Let me go to Eric in Georgia.  Eric, what's up? 
[01:30:30]  Hey, I just want to ask Anthony if tears hurt a cleanly shaven face.  Hey, why don't we move on?  The FU line is very popular with our listeners.  What are you talking about, sir?  No idea what that gentleman is even implying.  He's implying that you've been doing some crying.  What?  Well, you shaved the goatee, and they're wondering if the tears are hurting the fresh  harshly shaven face.  Nope.  Nothing like that. 
[01:31:00]  By the way, great night on TV last night.  Did anybody watch that one on NBC, My Name is Anthony?  Creepy mustache.  Come on.  I just wanted to try something, you know, a little different.  My fiancÃ© was getting in the fun because we were, like, you know, referring to you and  what you look like.  Yeah.  Jimmy was doing a great job saying that it's the Opie and Frank Zappa show.  Yes.  Opie and Raleigh Fingers. 
[01:31:30]  What else did you come out with?  Goose Gossage.  Goose Gossage.  And it wasn't too uncomfortable when my fiancÃ© made an Aladdin reference because that's  where her references come from.  That's cute.  Who was it?  Jafar or something like that from Aladdin?  Look, it's the Opie and Blues Clues show.  Danny's never heard anyone make Disney movie references to everything.  Yeah, well.  Was it Jafar from Aladdin?  I think.  Something like that.  Because rumor has it that tat on his arm is Ariel from The Little Mermaid. 
[01:32:00]  What?  You got an Ariel tattoo?  No, it's because of the red hair.  No, it's Ariel, right?  No.  Let me see.  Let me see it.  That is under the sea.  Right?  I see long hair and a mermaid.  Mermaid.  What is it?  He likes Disney?  No.  Oh, he loves it so much that he got an Ariel tattoo.  I'm refusing to go along with this.  You don't want to go along with that? 
[01:32:30]  Bit refusal.  Hey, that's not cool, man.  Bit refusal.  What is that?  Don't make me replay Steve's happy birthday message.  Okay, I'll go with the bit.  All right.  What is it?  It's a cover of an old book from the 30s called Who Goes There.  But you don't read.  Sometimes.  Yeah, but sometimes they turn books into movies.  That's why it's the picture, not the text.  It's a picture book.  Jason, California.  Did you get pitted?  I got pitted. 
[01:33:00]  What's up, Jason?  How you boys doing this morning?  I think good.  Jimmy, you're an effing genius.  I love you.  Oh, thank you.  You're over and overrating me, but thank you.  I'd like to go back a little bit and give a live eff to that.  I've been listening to you on XM for a couple of years now,  and you are a genius from your political views  and your burglary theory.  Yes, my home invasions.  You are 100% correct. 
[01:33:30]  I agree with you all the way.  Thank you, sir.  And I just want to give a live eff to you that Cleveland caller.  I would like to say after that statement that I might as well announce  that I am running for president of the United States.  What?  You can have my vote.  A little late, and I don't have much money,  but I'll just throw it out there.  Why not?  Well, you have more money now.  It's a grassroots movement.  You got more money now.  Oh, jeez.  And I want to thank Charlie Mason.  Mason?  What?  Oh, my God. 
[01:34:00]  Jackie Mason.  I was going with the Manson joke.  Oh!  I can't even look at Jimmy.  Old Charlie Mason.  I can't even look at you, Jimmy.  I actually wouldn't have gotten it until you said, like,  Charlie Mason.  Yeah.  I'm Jackie Manson.  I'm going to kill people.  Only Charles Manson would agree with.  I got a swastik in my head.  You got the Folgers coffee over here.  You got the bodies over there.  You got the great.  The Folgers there.  You got Sharon Tate over here.  You got a full belly over here. 
[01:34:30]  It seems they took a baby.  They called Tex because Charlie wanted to be the only Charlie in the family.  I wish I did better impressions.  It's murder.  That's right.  It almost sounded like Jim C.  They wrote with blood on the walls, Sam.  Sharon Tate didn't commit suicide.  Her hands were tied.  It was murder.  That's right.  Three-line Jim C.  It's all right, though.  That's three-line Jim C. 
[01:35:00]  Because we finally got the Quincy box there.  We're going to have a lot of Quincy audio for you, Jimmy,  on a future Opie and Anthony show.  Do you guys want to go to the FU line and see what's going on?  Are we doing anything on the show today?  I think so.  It's a weird one.  I like it.  I know I had way too much coffee.  All right, FU line.  Let's see what's going on.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message. 
[01:35:30]  I would like to give an FU out to my ex-boyfriend, Nick,  who tried to sleep with my best friend after four years of putting up with his crap.  Next message.  I want to give a big FU to Adam the intern.  As boring as you are to listen to on the air,  all the guys on the show were giving you air time  and trying to help your anti-social ass finally get laid.  FU, Adam.  Next message.  Yeah, what's up?  This is Ethan from North Hollywood, California,  and I want to give a big FU to my FU back neighbors 
[01:36:00]  who have called the cops every night for a week straight  and are causing me to get evicted.  Go FU yourself.  Next message.  Give a big FU to my boss and his non-working ass  and not knowing what the FU to do.  FU you.  Next message.  I like to give a FU to my ex-boyfriend, Jeff.  Hey, I faked it every time.  It's kind of hard to finish in 20 seconds.  Next message.  FU you.  End of new messages. 
[01:36:30]  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  That's it.  What?  Opie and Anthony on your radio.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Right.  We're just in a weird place today. 
[01:37:00]  The ice cream cake has arrived into the studio.  Sam was in charge of Steve's birthday,  and it's getting worse and worse as the morning goes along here.  If I was Steve, I would kill myself.  This is the worst birthday ever.  It's a Carvel Fudgie the Whale cake.  Well, Anthony, can we do the reset, though?  Steve's birthday.  Sam was responsible for making sure Steve has a great birthday.  He was supposed to decorate the studio.  He barely decorated the studio. 
[01:37:30]  It's a hard job of decorating.  There's one thing that says happy birthday.  It's tiny.  There's no banners.  Over this huge window.  No banners.  No balloons.  Not one balloon.  Noisemakers that barely work.  And a blow-up mail doll, which I'm sure Steve definitely appreciates.  Yeah.  But besides that, this birthday sucks, and I feel bad for Steve.  What's the cake say?  It's got to be nice.  Steve, maybe Steve could read the cake.  Yeah, Steve, why don't you read your birthday cake from Carvel?  Of course, you've got to get the ice cream cake.  Right.  Well, it's a lovely Fudgy the Whale cake, and in red icing on the top. 
[01:38:00]  Good.  Sam?  No, I...  It's illegible, first of all.  First of all.  I've got to say, they take Fudgy the Whale, which is a brown whale cake.  Yeah.  Then it's outlined in white cream, and then a face of a whale is put in white cream.  Yeah.  And then they take red icing and write something on there, which is completely illegible.  Can you read that?  No, barely.  And it's over his mouth.  And it's all written...  It looks like someone just squished out red icing on a stupid Fudgy the Whale cake. 
[01:38:30]  It's a mess of red icing, and since, like all people in this country, I read from left  to right, I shall read what it says.  Okay.  Happy E.T.V.  Birthday.  What?  Well...  And Steve has perfect diction, so I...  Yes.  I'm assuming that you read that perfectly.  I read that perfectly.  Okay.  When you say dick shun, he's never shunned one.  Jim Norton will be at the Egg in Albany later today.  Sorry, I just threw the wordplay to you.  No, it was good, though.  Wait, let me read this thing. 
[01:39:00]  Ugh.  Happy birthday, but then they put the E-T-E-V-E?  That's how they spelled Steve?  I think somebody must have told Carvel that the theme of today's birthday party is queer  and incompetence.  So they played right along.  They went ahead and instead of putting a message that was somewhat sarcastic on there, which  I had instructed them to, they wrote, happy birthday, Steve, but spelled Steve E-T-E-V-E.  Oh, my gosh. 
[01:39:30]  What was the sarcastic message that you were going to have them put on there, Sam?  No, it was, here's to another year of incompetence, cake property, DFL Media, and then I was going  to plug a website for you.  That would have been funny.  Thank you.  We should put a huge Foundry logo across that cupcake.  Yes.  Foundry the whale.  Yeah.  Foundry the whale.  Can we get a picture of the cake up on onaradio.com?  Oh, damn, Travis.  Good one.  Wait, I missed it.  Why?  Foundry the whale. 
[01:40:00]  Travis goes, yeah, that's Steve.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  That was a good one, Joe.  That's not like the old days.  Oh, boy.  I love a piece of ice cream.  Pendulum.  Huh?  It's early.  It's a good time you eat ice cream cake.  Also, we sent Pat Duffy down to get it, and E-Rock shorted him $14 on the cake, so he  had to walk 17 blocks back in the snow holding this cake.  How much is a cake that you shorted $14?  What did he give him, $3?  This cake cost $54.  Shut up.  No, it didn't.  Yes.  Did it really?  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Don't put it near me, man.  That is a little Fudgy the whale, and it was $54?  And it says eat Eve on it.  And he didn't even get the name right.  Why is it $54?  I've bought Fudgy the whale cakes for you guys before, and they haven't cost $54.  I think you got ripped.  I didn't get ripped.  Like I said, E-Rock didn't give Pat Duffy enough money, so if anyone got ripped, sorry,  E-Rock.  Wait, did Pat Duffy buy drugs?  Pat Duffy, that cake cost $54.  Yeah, I have it received if I can prove it.  I believe you. 
[01:41:00]  Why is it $54?  Because they wrote Etive on it.  Etive.  Which Carvel is this that did a great job on the cake?  The one in Times Square.  Times Square.  Times Square Carvel.  Oh, that's for you.  Okay.  Great job on the cake.  That's why it costs so much, too.  You buy something in Times Square.  We were also in a panic yesterday morning because Pat Duffy was calling around all the Carvels  who claimed there was a citywide shortage on Fudgy the whale cakes.  That was last night.  It's totally fresh.  Why isn't that reported on the news that there's a citywide shortage of Fudgy the whales? 
[01:41:30]  I don't know.  Oh, please.  You know what?  Look, let's close the borders.  Now it's affecting our ice cream cakes.  That is exactly it.  I can't have this anymore.  Exactly.  Now I'm with everybody.  Close the borders.  If they can't spell Steve right on a dumb birthday cake, we obviously have a problem.  I remember walking into Carvel as a kid and there'd be a gentleman there and he'd go,  Hi, how are you?  And what would you like?  And then you tell him, now, Etive. 
[01:42:00]  Etive.  Etive.  Do you have a picture of that cake?  No, we'll get one before we cut it up.  Let's take a quick picture and then start eating it because I'm really hungry.  I would love some Etive cake.  I'd love some Etive.  You're going to yell at yourself later.  This is where you will have to hear it.  This is Fudgy the whale.  Kenny will have to hear it.  But why'd you eat it?  No.  He doesn't ever say that.  You deserve it.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Just take care.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  That's Kenny's way of saying shut your mouth.  Oh, well, speaking of Steve's birthday. 
[01:42:30]  Happy birthday, Steve.  Happy birthday, Steve.  Oh, no.  It's Steve's birthday.  Happy birthday, Steve.  It's Steve's birthday.  Yes, it's Steve's birthday.  Radio for the rest of us.  It's Steve's birthday.  How old are you now?  It's Steve's birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  And many more.  Okay. 
[01:43:00]  No one's enjoying it.  Oh, my God.  I'm enjoying it.  I'd rather listen to Maxwell.  And.  Happy birthday.  It's just not funny.  What a dude scumbag.  Really.  What a waste of space on the radio.  Corey, Jersey, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Hey, listen.  Getting pitted is when you pull into a bow.  And the wave breaks over your head. 
[01:43:30]  And you're totally inside it.  And you're like a little pit.  Like a little olive pit.  So is getting pitted a good thing?  Hell, yeah.  It's a good thing, man.  Of course.  Oh, I actually explained it already.  All right.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Jimmy's a big surfer, dude.  Yeah.  You don't know that about Jimmy.  Hey, what's up?  All right.  Thank you for the definition of pitted.  But the park is still flooded.  So you'll see kids out there again today, sir.  Some of those kids today will be my co-hosts.  It's just like, dude, you got the best barrels ever, dude.  It's just like you pull in.  And you just get spit right out of them. 
[01:44:00]  And you just drop in.  And just smack the lip.  Hold back.  Drop down.  Snap.  And then after that, you just drop in.  Just ride the barrel and get pitted.  So pitted like that.  I know it's an old video.  How old is it?  It's, I was told about this like over the summer or something.  But we're going to get the video up on onaradio.com as part of Stephen S.  From Bayshore's Rundown.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And other things.  Oh, you know what?  We should do this because we're obsessed with chickens. 
[01:44:30]  Everyone knows that.  Well, the people that linger longer with the radio show.  Maybe.  We hate chickens and how stupid they are.  And we had a story yesterday about a truck overturning.  The chickens got loose because he was transporting chickens and they're all over the highway.  Yeah.  And they're just standing on the side of the road.  Because they're stupid.  Because they're stupid.  They're not running away.  They're not trying to free themselves.  But where would they go?  You know what?  Chickens seem to be the only animal that don't have a natural habitat. 
[01:45:00]  You never see a...  I do a plane.  A plane.  That's where you belong.  You never see a herd of chickens on the plains.  It's just they don't have a natural habitat.  But if you're...  You don't see wild chickens.  But if you had a brain, you would think anything's got to be better than going back on this truck.  Where are they going?  Get in an apartment?  Whatever.  Run.  Just run.  Run and try to figure it out.  Instead, they just stand on the side of the road. 
[01:45:30]  They can't like a goose or a duck can jump in the water and swim around.  Right.  Chickens just...  They look out of place anywhere but on a spit.  Mm-hmm.  Just being roasted on a barbecue grill.  There is no such thing as a herd of chickens.  Chickens.  Yeah.  Wild chickens.  Wild chicken.  They're called...  Attacking people.  They're called pods.  No, they're not.  Yeah.  I would say it's a flock of chickens.  They travel...  Because they're birds.  No, they travel in pods.  Is it a murder? 
[01:46:00]  Murder.  That's what they call a...  What?  Crows?  They found little peck marks all over his body, Sam.  The chicken had skin in his feet.  Quincy's so passionate about his stuff.  Oh, Gypsy.  They got blood all over my members only, Jack.  Clans, why do I have tiny genitals?  We all know exactly why you do, Sam.  Just can't say it.  That's right. 
[01:46:30]  We'd be fired.  You're half man, half baby.  Gypsy.  Gypsy.  How's the Steve cake?  Worth every calorie.  Tee-hee.  Tee-hee is right.  So we got more on the chickens.  Fox talks about the chicken truck crashing, and they got the awful banter here.  Good.  I like a chicken on the BBQ, but not on the BQE.  See, that's the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. 
[01:47:00]  They call it the BQE.  They call it the BQE.  Yeah.  So that's where the truck overturns.  So she likes it on the BBQ, which is the barbecue.  Of course.  Let's say hi to Robert in Birmingham.  Robert.  Yeah, hey, guys.  Hey.  I get the impression that Opie's going to take Anthony to the bank to get $20,000 out.  Hey, so anyway, they were talking about chickens on the news. 
[01:47:30]  Yes.  And they had to make a little joke about it.  I like a chicken on the BBQ, but not on the BQE.  No.  That's very funny, you see you.  Since we're spelling.  Just read the news from the newsreader.  Right.  I like a chicken on the BBQ, but not on the BQE.  Stop it!  You do your chicken for us. 
[01:48:00]  I do a chicken.  I do?  Don't you?  Hopefully it's a German chicken.  That's a sick rooster.  This is for your yucky late winter sunrise.  The Homer boo.  My new favorite sound effect.  Oh, yeah.  Who is he booing?  Probably like, who knows?  The who?  I don't know.  The audio is really bad in this.  I don't know.  I didn't get it.  Is it?  We decide not to work today. 
[01:48:30]  That doesn't mean you guys should stop working.  Chickens actually got free of those crates, so it was a big mess.  Those are what I call free-range chickens.  Yes.  And they crossed the road.  The chickens crossed the road.  And now we know why.  Just to get away from the men.  I have an improv.  Wait, what was the end of her joke?  To get away from the men.  To get away from the men.  What?  That are trying to get him, I guess.  I have a funny joke.  Yes?  Hey, since the chicken crossed the road, wouldn't you like a rooster across your face? 
[01:49:00]  That'd be a great little news improv.  It would.  You ever accidentally sit on a black rooster?  A rooster in each hand?  And smack another rooster on your chin?  You ever do that?  News improper?  News improper.  You an improv bitch?  Hey, let's not forget, the animation contest ends today.  Yes.  We're not happy about that because the animations are coming in and they look great. 
[01:49:30]  All of them are up on onaradio.com.  We're going to pick a winner today.  Thanks for that movie, the Jack Black movie.  Be Kind Rewind.  That's right.  And we're going to start up a brand new animation contest next week because everyone bitched  and said, look, you know, 10 days is not enough.  10 days, two weeks is not enough time to get a really good animation together.  Although we did get some really, really good entries.  So we're going to start up the contest next week.  We don't even know for what type of prize. 
[01:50:00]  We just know we'll get something good in the end.  And we'll make the contest last a nice two to about two months.  So you really get some fine things in.  Yeah, they got time to do it.  It's not like this is a quick thing.  We're on to something with this animation thing.  So go to onaradio.com to see some great animations from some of the fine bits from this radio show.  And we'll start up the brand new contest next week.  We'll have more details.  Right now we do know that, what, Jimmy, you're donating a wow sticker and a what?  A CD.  And a CD signed by you? 
[01:50:30]  Jesus.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  I mean, you want to just really, why not just throw $10,000 at them?  All right.  Fine.  All right.  And we'll add to the prize.  But so far, that's what we got.  And that's all you need to know.  All right.  So keep animating.  The contest is not over.  And we're going to add more bits that you can choose from.  And at this point, you can choose whatever you want.  You can go old school.  You can do an animation of $100,000 or something.  That would be nice.  Danny, what do we know about this basketball player, Pukin?  Apparently, this was from a college game a few days ago, Virginia Tech and Maryland.  And they had to actually stop the game for about 10 minutes while they cleaned up the 
[01:51:00]  amount of puke that this backup forward had left on the court.  This clip that Opaz, it's two of the announcers just going on about, well, first I'm getting sick,  and then they have to comment about how much of it there was.  Really?  All right.  Let's take a listen here.  I'm going to box out here.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, my goodness.  And we're going to hear announcer voices, right?  Here's a real moment.  They're still going to be like, oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Whoa.  Box out here.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  He threw up.  Dorenzo Hudson is sick and throws up right on the court.  Oh, boy.  That's a humongous pile there, Bill.  This is going to have to take a while to clean this up.  He missed the second free throw.  And Dorenzo goes to the bench. 
[01:52:00]  That's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  It's going to be a while to get cleaned up here, Bill.  The crowd is chanting, that's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  Wait, they shot the second free throw,  even though there was puke on the court?  Apparently.  Wow.  Yeah, unfortunately, I did check out the video.  There's no video of the vomit itself.  Oh, no?  Like this video of it just sitting on the court?  Well, not even.  There's more of it of just the bottom manager guy 
[01:52:30]  who had to go out there with the towel.  Look.  Was he just, like, standing there and vomited?  Yeah, he's off to the side.  You couldn't really see him do it,  but you could tell that he was kind of sick  because, like, he had a towel over his face  and he was just kind of pacing,  and the camera wasn't on him.  Goodness gracious!  Box out here.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness, he threw up.  Lorenzo Hudson is sick  and throws up right on the court. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, my God!  Oh, boy, that's a humongous.  Oh, there, Bill.  That's about to take a while to clean this up.  He's really sick.  He missed the second free throw.  And Lorenzo goes to the bench.  It's going to take a while to get cleaned up here, Bill.  All right.  All right.  That's great. 
[01:53:30]  A lot of questions coming in all of a sudden.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow, a lot of...  You want to answer any of those?  Not really.  Okay.  Why don't we remind people that they can get a free corn dog  because this is just a terrific radio station we work for here in New York City.  We're hosting a private semi-pro screening Tuesday at AMC Empire.  That's 234 West 42nd Street in Manhattan.  It's exciting.  This movie looks like it's going to be good,  and we're going to watch it with some listeners Tuesday. 
[01:54:00]  Right at 11 a.m.  We'll be down there to watch the movie.  The first 75 people will get to attend the screening.  I guess it's a small theater, huh?  Is it one of the screening rooms?  I would imagine so.  I'm not sure how big the place is.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  We just discovered the screening rooms only recently.  Yeah.  It's like a mini theater.  Seats are twice as big.  It only fits like 100 people.  Uh-huh.  It feels like you're lounging in your living room watching these movies.  It's amazing.  I highly recommend it if it's that type of a place that you show up on Tuesday at 11 a.m. 
[01:54:30]  The info should be up on onaradio.com.  But anyway, the first 75 people get to go to the screening.  And they'll also get a free corndog.  Hey, how about that?  A free corndog?  Yep.  Only the first 75, though.  Number 76.  You're out of luck.  No corndog for you.  Imagine being number 76.  How disappointed you'd be.  I bet there'd be a big rivalry for 75 and 75.  Oh, right? 
[01:55:00]  I guess we should agree with corporate.  We shouldn't make fun of this stuff because this is really good radio.  Yeah, it's true.  You're right.  You can make this stuff up.  Are they going to just be handing out corndogs to the people?  I hope not.  I hope they're actually throwing them in the air and you have to go and catch it.  What are they doing?  What are they doing?  I guess there's a corndog scene in Semi Pro, huh?  I hope so.  That's the tie-in?  Yeah.  Why can't we just watch the movie?  Why do you have to hand out corndogs?  It's going to be some kind of a gag.  Out of the 75 corndogs that we hand out, I will bet that 70 end up on the sidewalk. 
[01:55:30]  On the floor.  In a big pile.  Stepped on.  And the other five wind up against the screen.  Right.  Corndog smears against the movie screen.  How about you show up to see a good movie by Will Ferrell?  That would be a great backfire, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, first come, first serve.  Like a flock of birds with all corndogs going over your head in the theater.  Hey, Jimmy, can you read this next line?  Because they did put an exclamation point.  Because it's very important to get the corndogs. 
[01:56:00]  So start with the first 75 people.  So Jimmy will read it correctly because he follows the punctuation in copy.  That's right.  Okay.  You can start over if you like.  Semi-pro private screening.  We are hosting a private semi-pro screening Tuesday at AMC Empire, 234 West 42nd Street  in Manhattan at 11 a.m.  Why?  Was there an exclamation point there, Jimmy?  There sure was.  Must have been.  Okay.  The first 75 people will get to attend the screening and get a free corndog first come, first serve. 
[01:56:30]  See?  Because there was another exclamation point at the end of that sentence, right, Jimmy?  Yes, there was.  Okay.  Semi-pro starring Will Ferrell, putting the funk into the dunk in theaters February 29th.  Yeah, no exclamation point about that.  Only exclamation points that are surrounding the corndog crap.  And they actually had to write first come, first serve.  Like, what did we think?  That we were going to be able to hold places in line?  You know.  When somebody was going to show up 80th and go, but I wasn't here, so it's my turn.  Yeah.  You know what you do?  So, if they were giving away, like, iPods to the first 75 people, then exclamation points 
[01:57:00]  and then first come, first serve.  Yeah.  Because that's exciting.  But we're talking about a dumb corndog.  It's a corndog.  All right.  Well, anything cool to play going to break there, Steve?  Let me think.  Why would you know?  That's right.  Why would you know?  Why would you know?  Well, there's a flute.  Huh?  You hit the FU line already.  You did the Black History Month already.  Mm-hmm.  How about the...  Did he ask, what did we do already? 
[01:57:30]  Exactly.  No, we didn't.  Why don't you just list other things that we did?  Well, we got up early.  We showed up for work.  We had some snow.  Why do I bother?  I'm not...  I'm just trying to talk to you.  I know you are.  You want me to do the Albany plug again?  I'll do that.  That's always funny.  Why don't you?  Tonight, the egg.  Yeah.  518-473-1845.  If people don't show up, I will commit suicide.  Oh, Jimmy.  Six hours in the snow I'm going to deal with.  Well, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  He'll make you happy.  Max, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Max.  Is this sounding like anything today? 
[01:58:00]  It's just cold as hell down here.  Well, geez.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Anyhow, I wonder if that...  Why be in tune with the radio show you're calling?  Why would you be?  What are you saying, Max?  What's up, Max?  I wonder if that basketball player had fish and cream sauce before the game.  Yeah, that's right.  Jimmy, there it is.  This is how we go to break with the sounds of Jim Norton after having fish with cream sauce 
[01:58:30]  on a plane as he was flying out to San Francisco a mere few hours later in the hotel.  Enjoy as we go to break with the O.P. Anthony show.  Oh, that's better.  Is it?  By the way, this is going to make us number one in Cleveland in no time. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ, Steve.  Pray for me. 
[01:59:30]  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Hand puns.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're bringing us back with Pendulum from Foundry Music. 
[02:00:00]  Steve's old band that turned into a website.  Crank it up.  I got to hear this.  All right, crank it.  Yeah.  This is Steve C's old band.  Yeah.  Where's the vocals?  I want to hear Steve C.  Yeah, Steve C on vocals, by the way.  Whose birthday it is today.  Coming back.  Wouldn't this be great on Guitar Hero?  No. 
[02:00:30]  Guitar Hero.  She's all right.  Enough with that.  It was a riff.  Well, they thought the riff was great.  Oh, it's a rejoiner?  Oh, it's a rejoiner.  Okay.  No wonder.  I thought maybe Steve was off eating during that.  He's the only...  Hey, did you see him in that band?  He was huge.  Come on.  And he wore the Lamb Bryant dresses, let's not forget.  Hey, Foundry Music is the only band in the history of rock and roll that turned into a website.  Yeah.  Find me another band that turned into a website and stopped playing music. 
[02:01:00]  You ever hear some old Google?  I love popping in some old Google.  Yeah.  I saw Sabbath in the mid-80s with Yahoo opening.  It's great stuff.  Yep.  And now they're just a website.  Absolutely.  I'm with you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  My favorite, though, was when Ozzy toured in like 98 and our two girls, one couple  was on the small station.  On the small station.  That's good.  Red tube.  Wouldn't they be on...  I knew Danny would go, I know that one. 
[02:01:30]  I feel it's bookmarked.  Oh, man.  I can't believe I lost my Ogre CD.  We can just do this all day.  Yeah.  Yes, you ogre.  We're fading quickly.  Do you get it, guys?  Exactly.  Websites, bands.  Thank you.  And scene.  Pull over, folks.  And punch.  AOL joke coming up.  Oh, huddle, huddle.  What is wrong with us?  I say it's the weather.  Anthony's craziness is rubbing off on all of us.  I say it's the weather.  You're bringing us down with you with your insanity. 
[02:02:00]  No, I'm a sane mother...  Why don't you look in the mirror if you think you're sane?  I am sane.  I look in the mirror.  Anthony is nuts.  How would I not be sane when I look in the mirror?  Because that's when I have my conversations.  Hi, Anthony.  But I can never say anything different than the guys talking in the mirror.  He always knows exactly what I'm saying, exactly when I say it.  And I try to trick him sometimes, but he knows.  Let's go to Jay in Alabama.  What's AL?  Alabama or Alaska? 
[02:02:30]  Arkansas.  Arkansas.  Jay from Arkansas.  What's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yes, sir.  Anthony, did you get the question?  The old ultimatum.  So, Jimmy's going to be leaving soon because he has to get up to Albany to perform at the Egg tonight.  That's right.  What about that?  Huh?  Oh, nothing.  I was just pondering.  I wonder what he meant.  The Egg.  Speaking of Egg, I forgot how rotten the inside of Kenny's truck is going to smell. 
[02:03:00]  Ice cream cake has lactose in it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  A five-hour ride with Kenny.  Oh, no.  Big boy Mick is stinky.  Oh, God.  Already it's happening.  That fast?  You don't understand.  Here's how it works.  Boop.  Pfft.  Oh.  Pfft.  Fudgy the underwear.  It really is.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  I'll fire one out every time he intermittently uses his wife.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Hey, we got something for Cleveland.  Good morning, Cleveland.  This is a douche on the radio up there, Maxwell.  Yeah.  And he is a douche.  Trying to claim that he's doing just great in radio.  We suck, which it's just, I don't even know what to say to that.  Yeah, it's beyond.  I don't even know what to say to that.  We're on XM Satellite Radio.  We're the number one channel on XM.  We reach a minimum of two million people on XM alone. 
[02:04:00]  And then we're syndicated to close to 20 stations if you count the crappy AMs.  But Maxwell.  Hey, for the people listening on the AMs, hi.  How you doing?  What?  And for the, you know, program directors and everyone else, hi.  Oh, they know.  We like you.  They even know they're programming a crappy AM.  No.  They know.  No, it's wonderful.  They know.  They're at Kinko every week setting out their resume.  Let me tell you something.  They're hoping to get on an FM station.  I love, my favorite modulation? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Amplitude.  Amplitude?  Absolutely.  That's my favorite type of modulation.  I just hope the listeners are smart enough to just see through this crap.  You got a guy that's obviously jealous of what we're doing.  We try to downplay what we do.  But the reality is we're radio stars.  We really are.  Not many people are actually bigger than what we're doing.  And then you got a douche like this Maxwell trying to convince his listeners that he's  doing well as he sits in one market, in afternoons, by the way.  And we suck. 
[02:05:00]  The bottom line is this is what bothers me about Maxwell.  Because we fought with other shows.  Again, JV and Elvis, Lexington.  We fought with a lot of shows.  Because, Matt, I encourage you to go on YouTube and look him up.  That's how, he's an unfunny guy.  He's just a fat slob who tries so hard to be like a rock star.  Hey, it's just not funny.  You know, let me tell you something.  Just one of those fat loads who sits at a party and bores everybody. 
[02:05:30]  And, last of all, you're a boring guy.  You're not a funny dude, and you never were.  And you don't know anything about comedy.  Like, he's trashing my comedy.  And going, his first hour was good.  No, it wasn't, stupid.  My first hour, when I used to go, people would say, where are you from?  And I'd go, New Jersey, and give him the finger.  That was when I was good?  Shut your mouth.  Oh, you didn't do that.  I did.  Stop.  I'm not proud of it, but I'm realistic.  He doesn't.  Of course, he's not a funny guy.  So, how would he understand the progress of you?  He doesn't.  And he used to trash Rover, who did mornings. 
[02:06:00]  Now, I guess they're going to be teaming up.  So, now, they're best friends, which is such a crock of ass, I can't even tell you.  But, whatever.  Let's hear what Maxwell had to say.  Dude, there's just stuff in this business.  You put them up against Rover, Rover would destroy them.  Oh, God.  Like, it wouldn't even be an issue.  It's so funny.  Stupid, right?  Opie.  Is that actually that guy's name?  No, I think it's... 
[02:06:30]  By the way...  He's actually going to try to make fun of my name?  Maxwell.  You dope.  I make fun of my own name, you ass.  Does anybody know Maxwell's real name?  Huh?  Does anyone know Maxwell's real name?  I don't know.  I believe I do.  What is it?  I'm sure he says it on his own show.  I believe it's Benjamin Bornstein.  Ugh.  Now, if that's the same...  I believe that is his name.  Which maybe he's...  I'm sure he tells his listeners.  Yeah.  I'm not saying he would lie to his listeners.  Maybe he does tell them.  Benjamin Bornstein.  I believe that is his real name.  He's actually making...  He's actually making fun of my name. 
[02:07:00]  I make fun of my name, you dope.  I hate my name.  I got it when I was 12 years old, you idiot.  You know what it is?  It's the easiest thing to do when you have nothing.  And then he goes with the dramatic pauses that he learned from...  Who did you learn that from?  Was it Mancow or Lycus?  Or Bubba.  Or Bubba.  I can't tell which voice you're imitating.  See, we're at least using our real voices.  You're doing an imitation of Mancow meets Lycus meets Bubba.  Yeah.  You're basically a personality thief.  You're a phony.  And you should have at least stolen somebody funny's personality. 
[02:07:30]  And this is the odd thing about the name thing.  You cut...  Every article written about it is Greg Opie Hughes.  You make fun of the fact that you're Opie.  Right.  And also...  I hate my name.  I'll be the first to say it.  You'll step out and go, oh, this is Greg Hughes, the actor who plays Opie.  There's never like a hiding.  Yeah.  Right.  As opposed to someone trying to be a rock star.  I think the name Maxwell is cool.  Maxwell.  How is that cool?  It's a coffee, you douche.  And by the way, everyone knows my name is actually Greg Odeo.  Oh.  That's right. 
[02:08:00]  It's going to win the animation contest.  Much more powerful.  That's right.  You got to twist that elbow in.  Twist the elbow in.  Twist it in toward your belly button as you say the name.  That's what you do.  Greg Odeo.  Can we hear more?  I want to hear the agreeing parrots in the background.  Yeah, good point.  See, Maxwell, you're going to have to do a lot better than making fun of my dumb name.  A lot better.  That's like...  That's hat crap.  Anyone could do that.  Hey, Opie.  Is that actually that guy's name?  No.  I think it's actually...  I don't even know anything about the guys.  I know.  You know what?  When someone says, I fucking hate radio guys. 
[02:08:30]  Oh.  God, do I hate these people.  Hate them.  I'll piss out.  Let me take you inside this little bit that he's doing.  When someone says, I don't know anything about the guy, they know way too much about me.  Everything.  They follow our careers.  They know every single little thing about us.  God, I study this crap.  I study body language.  I study how people talk.  The great Charles Getzinger back in Geneseo. 
[02:09:00]  Unfortunately, he's gone.  He died, unfortunately.  He was a great professor in Geneseo.  And this guy taught me the art of communications and following body language and stuff and how people talk and how they stand and all this crap.  When someone says, I don't know anything about this guy, it means he knows everything about me.  He's probably a stalker.  He's a stalker.  I don't even know anything about the guy. 
[02:09:30]  I know.  I know.  I should probably know everything, but I don't care.  But I don't.  I think his name is Greg, which is funny because they were talking about your name.  No, you know my name's Greg.  And when you say you don't care, it means you care a lot.  We've fallen into that trap when we go, I don't care what Howard's saying.  Of course we care when we say we don't care.  That's what people do.  Funny because they were talking about your name.  The stupid radio name.  I was like, like Opie?  It gets hurt than Opie? 
[02:10:00]  Hey, look, he's got red hair.  It's got to be Opie.  Welcome to Mayberry.  Mayberry jokes and redheaded jokes.  First of all, I don't have red hair.  That is such a hack thing to do.  Cutting edge funny stuff.  Yeah.  Very cutting edge funny.  A Mayberry joke with phony laughter from a guy with a stolen persona.  Yeah.  Hey, Dirtbag, why don't you use your real voice?  Why don't you stop stealing someone else's personality?  Use your real name, too, you self-hating Jew.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  That's what it sounds like he is.  Benjamin Boyd.  Be proud of your Jewish heritage.  So that's what he had on me, making fun of my name.  That was terrific.  I don't understand why the radio world just doesn't embrace you and put you in every market  in America with stuff like that.  My God.  Wow.  The bottom line is, of course, and then put after that.  And put.  That was terrific.  Your listeners are just eating it up.  Die.  He's a cornball.  And there's nothing more offensive to me in humor than a cornball. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  You're corny, Maxwell.  And I know the sidekick has to agree with you.  I get that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dummy.  Stansberry, do me a solid.  Go sit in a hot tub filled with a puddle of AIDS.  Yeah.  Slip and slide AIDS comedy right now.  Got it?  That's all they do is talk New York.  That's all they do.  Stupid dummy.  And then they go to commercial breaks.  That's it.  Look, dummy.  Patricia O'Neill is here. 
[02:11:30]  We'll be back.  Stupid.  That's it.  That's all they do.  I thought you didn't know anything about us.  Exactly.  What a dope.  How do you know about us?  Those Patrice.  Can I be honest with you?  That's really funny.  This is where we're a very honest show.  The only thing I know about this guy is the audio that is brought to us when he talks about us.  That we play on the air.  By Sam.  Yeah.  We're not monitoring your show because we don't monitor shows that we're not scared of, you idiot.  I couldn't tell you. 
[02:12:00]  I couldn't name one bit or the bit that we played.  But I don't even remember anymore.  I can name a bit.  And I encourage people to look at it on YouTube because I looked it up on YouTube.  All right.  Yes, I did.  And it was something about how you know.  This is Maxwell being very edgy.  How you know you're spending too much money in a strip club.  And it's really.  Can you guys find that real quick?  How you.  Oh, it's five to nine.  But for next week.  How you know you're spending too much money in a strip club.  Look up what this faggot thinks is cutting edge funny radio.  And if you like that better, then I encourage you to never listen to the show again. 
[02:12:30]  Go over there and listen to the show.  Have fun.  He's an unfunny, fat, fat guy.  And he's a liar.  You know what it is?  Liar.  He goes, I don't know anything about him.  But then he's like pretty much reciting, you mock him, what we do on our show.  I swear on the lives of my family members, I don't know anything about this guy.  I don't.  I don't even know.  And I've been listening to the tape.  I don't even know the sidekick's name.  And I swear to you, I swear on my family right now as I sit here, I don't know the sidekick's 
[02:13:00]  name.  I just know that this douche is called Maxwell.  That's all I know.  By the way.  And he's the end punt guy.  By the way, I encourage my fans to make his life a living hell.  He knows our guests.  No problem.  He knows our guests.  Of course he does.  He knows everything about us.  And finally this, because we've got to get out of here, Jimmy.  We'll play more maybe on Monday.  This guy's terrific.  And then they bring in comics who are actually funny.  Yeah.  And then they talk about Hillary Clinton's legs.  Look how fat her legs are.  What? 
[02:13:30]  I thought you didn't know anything about this show, you liars.  Jesus.  He makes it sound like we have a hundred jokes on Hillary's legs.  We might have done a couple like you should be doing.  But here's a little advice.  If you're going to take the tack that you don't know us, don't then recite our guests  and what you assume are bits we've done.  And it doesn't sound very honest. 
[02:14:00]  There's two little radio frauds.  By the way, if you want to talk to these guys, they're terrific.  They're on in afternoons in Cleveland.  But call anytime.  Don't curse on the air, because that will get dumped out of and hurt their show.  No, they don't take calls, because they can't take this on.  1-800-348-107.  1-800-348-107.  Or 216-578-107.  And make sure you don't use profanity or insult to a picture.  And I want to say hi to them, because I guarantee they're listening right now.  Be nice.  Guarantee it.  Say hi to them.  Oh, that for me was like, what? 
[02:14:30]  I'm an idiot.  I used to be so, so mystified by guys that were on the radio.  You know what I mean?  Like, I would hear radio shows.  I'd be like, wow, like, how do they do that?  Until you do it.  And you're like, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All that harsh.  What?  Oh.  Read half a newspaper, smoke a joint, and you're all for it.  This guy parties.  He's a partier.  Oh.  See.  That's how you do it.  You change your voice.  Oh.  See, I don't smoke joints, idiot.  None of us do. 
[02:15:00]  I take this very seriously.  That's why you'll be stuck.  And not to make fun of Cleveland, what I need to explain about radio is that people want to  move on to bigger and better markets.  And what I mean by that, larger cities that give you the potential to talk to a lot more  people, someone like Maxwell will be stuck in a market, you know, a smaller market like  Cleveland because he just doesn't have it.  I mean, you know, make fun all you want.  We're hurt in two countries, you idiots.  You don't have it.  You know what?  And I hate to say it, but we do make a lot of money.  So, you know, and I only bring that up because if we were that bad, trust me, companies would 
[02:15:30]  love to chop your head off and save the money.  Just try to match the success the show has had.  Yeah, then talk.  This show.  Not even financially.  Just as far as listenership goes and markets and a press, things like that.  Just try to match that type of success.  Try to be syndicated to one other city.  That would be a good start.  One other city is a good start.  Anthony and I and Jimmy, we've been hurt in multiple cities. 
[02:16:00]  Stupid.  Falling a puddle of AIDS.  For eight years.  Oh.  For eight years, we've been in multiple cities.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's how I used to be so mystified by guys on the radio.  Were you?  Yeah.  Of course you're not now because you're hardly on it.  Did you think it was little people in there talking?  You retard.  You goddamn.  Hey, Cleveland.  Trust me.  Keep listening.  It's going to be very exciting in the coming months. 
[02:16:30]  The Benjamin Bornstein and Fat Agreeer show.  Yeah.  Because that's what he is.  And they're phonies who don't use their own voices.  That's a repugnant, boring, hack radio guy.  Yeah.  That's what you are, Maxwell.  It's all you're ever going to be.  Benny.  He knows it.  Of course he knows it.  Benny.  Benny Bornstein.  Hey, Benny.  He's, uh, there's so much jealousy in that, in those clips.  So much jealousy.  Well, this is Opie's stupid name. 
[02:17:00]  Get it?  His name, Opie.  Like, I don't know, you idiot.  And it was too late to change it.  I wanted to change this name, uh, probably, uh, when we were in Boston over ten years ago.  Uh-huh.  At that point, we were getting recognition.  It was too late.  So I'm stuck with this name.  Yes.  I hate it.  I don't know anything about their show.  Why is he called Opie?  His real name is Greg.  Anthony lives in Long Island.  How come he was at Petitia?  Wow.  Good guess.  That's a great guesser.  He's just at random guessing things, and he's hitting them. 
[02:17:30]  Come on, man.  Be real.  All right, Jimmy.  Just be real, you lying frauds.  Jimmy's going to be at the Egg in Albany.  Albany.  And I would plug Cleveland, but this unsuccessful radio show, I'm already sold out.  Two advanced shows sold out.  Oh, that sucks, Jimmy.  Because nobody listens to us.  I'm sorry about that.  They're all driving in from New York.  Yeah.  Also, all the music's going out, too.  Also, we usually go over to XM, but we're so great at this thing, we decided to take  a snow day.  So go after yourselves.  We'll see you Monday.  We'll see you Monday. </pre>
