<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a furious discussion about a fabricated New York Post Page Six story alleging a sex tape featuring Opie’s fiancée and Bam Margera.  Opie and Anthony vehemently deny the story,  detailing their attempts to debunk it, including Opie’s offer of $100,000 for a copy of the non-existent tape. They harshly criticize journalist Chauncey Hayden, who admitted to publishing the story without seeing any evidence.  The hosts lament the laziness of modern journalism, citing examples like local news relying on YouTube clips.  Jimmy Norton is in studio, promoting his Chicago and Pittsburgh stand-up shows and his popular Grand Theft Auto 4 YouTube video.  The segment includes tangents about Playstation 3 setup difficulties, a listener call about a perceived "Bam" ban, and humorous anecdotes about animal attacks (a grizzly bear killing its trainer and a chimpanzee attack fueled by a birthday cake).  A bizarre story about Indonesian massage parlors using padlocks is also discussed. The show teases a “bombshell” revelation about the sex tape later in the broadcast.

The show then transitions to a discussion about Jonathan, a collector of unusual memorabilia (including Fidel Castro-signed cigars, which his secretary mistakenly threw away).  This leads to a conversation about the hosts' and a caller's prized possessions.  A live news report of a bear shooting in New Jersey is shown, prompting strong emotional reactions. The graphic nature of the event is explicitly noted.  The hosts return to the New York Post article, playing a phone call with Bam Margera, who denies any knowledge of the alleged tape. They highlight the perceived laziness of the New York Post reporters and express their frustration with former employees and journalists involved. Numerous commercial breaks for various sponsors, including PC support, XM radio, Ashley Madison, ProFlowers, and Gamefly, air throughout.  A call from Jim Jefferies promoting his stand-up shows is also included. A humorous bit involving Joey Fatone and Lance Bass is played.

The broadcast continues with a golf story featuring Bill Parcells and Tyson Walter, transitioning into anecdotes about NFL players' behavior (Larry Allen using his car as a spittoon and Barry Switzer's airport handgun incident).  The hosts and callers discuss drug use in the NFL, specifically mentioning Hollywood Henderson’s alleged cocaine use during a Super Bowl and Michael Irvin's off-field issues.  The conversation shifts to baseball's slow pace and hockey, with the hosts teasing Travis about his wife's Canadian hockey fandom, calling him a "sports cuckold." A heated debate ensues about fan behavior in Philadelphia, Boston, and New York stadiums, including t-shirt bans. Jimmy Norton's attempts to quit smoking are also discussed.  A listener, Lisa (Travis’s Canadian wife), calls in, planning a Flyers game trip while wearing her Montreal Canadiens jersey, prompting jokes about potential repercussions.  Lisa reveals difficult family situations (both their mothers abandoned their families).  Further discussion of Lisa and Travis's dog Dexter and their YouTube endeavors ensues.  A news story about 13 sorcerers arrested in Congo for allegedly shrinking or stealing men's penises is discussed, leading to a recurring bit involving “Mr. Sorcerer”/“Jimsidry.”  The segment includes extensive profanity, crude humor, and a bet involving one host defecating in a listener’s hat.  Several more commercial breaks are mentioned.

Rich Voss calls in, discussing bringing his baby onstage during a show in Virginia, prompting jokes about his late fatherhood.  More sponsorships (Ashley Madison, PC support, XM radio, Extends, and LifeLock) are mentioned. A news story about Peter Falk's reported incoherent behavior is discussed.  A humorous “funnel-meter” segment rates the comedic value of various things (a Six Flags commercial, the Than and Sam radio show, and Jimmy Norton’s Warberry character), leading to jokes about ethnic stereotypes and comedy.  Randy Couture and Pat Cooper join the show.  They discuss Couture's UFC resignation, the differences between UFC and Pride fighting, the dangers of various fighting styles, and the lack of UFC fatalities compared to boxing.  They discuss other fighters (Fedor Emelianenko and Floyd Mayweather Jr.).

Randy Couture remains as a guest, discussing self-defense, gun ownership, and his experiences with dangerous situations.  The conversation shifts to Couture’s new movie, “Red Belt.”  A lengthy discussion of mixed martial arts, Couture’s career, rivalries (Fedor Emelianenko, Kurt Angle, Kimbo Slice), and his relationship with Dana White follows. A caller shares an anecdote about Couture's intimidating presence on "Pros vs. Joes."  Couture’s physical capabilities (from “Fight Science”) and his upcoming fight with Fedor Emelianenko are mentioned. Pat Cooper joins, launching into rambling, vulgar monologues about his career, aging, relationships with celebrities (Joe DiMaggio and Frank Sinatra), and a graphic account of his erectile dysfunction treatment. Mars, a martial artist and Couture fan, participates. The segment ends with plugs for Couture’s gym and “Red Belt.”

Pat Cooper remains as the sole guest, sharing explicit reflections on urination and anecdotes about a forced massage. He discusses past sexual exploits, restaurant preferences, opinions on Italian food, aging, health, and interactions with figures from the New York Mafia (John Gotti and Sammy "The Bull" Gravano). He promotes his comedy shows in Red Bank, NJ, Westbury, NY, and Schenectady, NY, and his Pal Talk show.  The hosts mention Jimmy Schubert.  Cooper shares a story about discovering water under his Las Vegas property and his opinions on Las Vegas. The segment is filled with digressions and crude jokes; the hosts also share anecdotes about bathroom breaks.

The final segment focuses heavily on a recurring comedic bit about Anthony's penis size, with crude and sexually explicit jokes involving scenarios in public restrooms.  Jimmy's alleged tendency to invade personal space, even in bathroom stalls, is discussed.  Several "line of the day" segments are included.  Ronnie B sends a supportive text message to Anthony.  The hosts reminisce about past experiences (a near-skinny dipping incident and their time at a previous radio station).  Advertisements for AshleyMadison.com, AdamandEve.com, GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting, and other sponsors are read. The segment concludes with more offensive jokes and a radio dare.

[00:04:30]  our fault is  we hire damaged people  you're fired  that's how we gotta do it  you're fired  we hire damaged people  because they make for some fine radio  I will never deny that  but then in the back of your head  Ann and I were talking a lot yesterday  we were talking about some of this stuff  and in the back of your head  you're thinking  wow  you know  this person could turn on us  yeah  hey  some of these days  I remember  and once again  I'm not naming any names 
[00:05:00]  I mean  we've had a lot of people work for us over the years  yeah  I remember a certain employee  instead of like  working for the show  he would just spend like  an incredible  I don't even want to put a time limit on it  like just  an incredible amount of time  on computers  and on different phones  just harassing the hell  out of other radio shows  yeah  and I thought it was hilarious  but I remember  even back then  you know  this can't be good  in the end  somehow this is gonna hurt us 
[00:05:30]  yeah  we were going down memory lane yesterday  weren't we  oh  certainly were  so yesterday was a perfect firestorm  of  you know  just  finally fed up  with ex-employees  running to the media  to try to trash us  and take us down  and the stupid media  just buying anything  they hear  because it makes for  a good story  oh  absolutely  and that's the other part  of this  so they print  out and out lies 
[00:06:00]  well they've been  printing out and out lies  about all of us  on this radio show  they never get their facts  right  that's one reason  I know  Jimmy Norton  heterosexual  you know  why  well hold on  what  that was a low blow  it certainly was  now eat your banana sexy like  I don't want to eat  I just want to play with it  push the back of your head on  I don't want you to do that  come on  we need something  give us the  give us the  yeah  alright  he pushes the back of his head 
[00:06:30]  onto his banana  as he eats it  we definitely need some  that's so god damn funny  we need a lot more humor today  because yesterday was very  very serious  but  for years  the media gets it wrong  about us  gets it wrong  about our show  gets it wrong  about some of the  crazy  outrageous things  we've done with our radio show  and once again  not saying this for  boo hoo  you know  we know  we know what we got  ourselves into  but yesterday  it finally came to a point 
[00:07:00]  like  had it  done  now we're going to  have some fun  and boy was I on the phone  pretty much  what time did we leave  yesterday  9 in the morning  from 9 in the morning  until 10 o'clock at night  and boy did we  as a radio show  get a lot of things  accomplished yesterday  a lot of things  came together  a lot of people  came to the table  absolutely  any more cliches  I could throw in there  no  no  and of course  the newspapers today  all running  running scared  and hiding  and not printing 
[00:07:30]  a follow up  to yesterday's  rant  that we did  on this show  why would they  this all started  with page 6  from the post  claiming that  that my lovely  fiance  who doesn't want  to be part of  any of this crap  who is an extremely  bright girl  she's a shy girl  has no desire  to be famous  no desire  to be in the media spotlight  no desire  to quote  get a little exposure 
[00:08:00]  page 6  and this Chauncey Hayden  went after  after my girl  yesterday  and claimed that  you know  before she met me  she did a sex tape  with Bam Margera  right  which is just  an all out lie  and I think  a lot of people  are starting to realize  that today  but unfortunately  the damage  has been done  and now  it's going to get  really  really ugly  some of the things  I found out yesterday  page 6 says  they tried to contact  you and I 
[00:08:30]  and our agent  for the last  three weeks  oh really  yeah  well  we're easily accessible  I will be signing  an affidavit  on that point alone  no one tried  to contact me  no one tried  to contact  Bam Margera  by the way  wait till we get  into that part  of the story  a little later  this morning  gee I wonder  how you know  that  wait till you  wait till we get  into that part  a little later  this morning  wait till the  Bombay doors  open up  and we drop  a few  right  today 
[00:09:00]  the fact is  we got  disgruntled  employees  that are  damaged  people  bad  people  not  not  not human  that  couldn't take  it when  their time  with the  Opie and Anthony  show was up  and now  they feel like  they have to  get you know  they have to  get us back  that's fine  actually  that's human  nature  I kind of  get that  in a way  but not  when it  comes to  just telling  flat out  lies  which  a couple  people  in  recent weeks  have been  doing  okay  yeah  and then  you got  Chauncey Hayden  who has  hated us  for a very  very long 
[00:09:30]  time  because we  don't give  him the  respect  that he's  just  desperately  freaking  hoping for  you know  he's a  he's a  Howard guy  and then  when  when Howard  Stern  you know  doesn't like  the guy  or you know  he's on the  outs with  Howard  then he tries  to come  into our  camp  and get  on our  good side  and trash  Howard  blah blah  blah  and we  just kind of  go oh  that's real  interesting  Chauncey  great  blah blah  blah  and we  don't want  anything  to do  with the  guy  so he's  had it  out for  us  for a  long  time  so he  decides 
[00:10:00]  somehow  he was  able to  get page  six  to print  this  incredible  lie  yesterday  about my  girl  and the  sex  tape  I have  I'll give  you this  much  already  I have  proof  someone  talked to  Chauncey  yesterday  on record  okay  Chauncey  admitted  on record  in this  interview  that he  never saw  a tape  now  the newspaper  article  said  there's a  tape  where they're  doing the  nasty  and 
[00:10:30]  he says  oh  and it's  nasty  he is  quoted  in page  six  saying  you know  about this  sex tape  starring  my  fiance  that  all the  action  is nasty  or something  like that  oh it is  nasty  nasty  and I mean  nasty  what's the  exact quote  because I'm  not  you know  I'm a  douche  well  me  yeah  well  yeah  where is  it there  Iraq  no  Chauncey  we don't  have it  in front  of me  right now  we'll 
[00:11:00]  get in  a second  and it  comes out  here  here's the  exact  quote  because my  buddy from  FMQB  this guy  Mike  interviewed  Chauncey  yesterday  oh here it  is  they're doing  this is what  Chauncey Hayden  said in the  article on  in page six  yesterday  about this  sex tape  Chauncey Hayden  they're doing  the nasty  and I mean  nasty  Hayden says  Hughes is taking  legal action  to prevent  its distribution  no I'm not  never did  because the  tape doesn't  exist  wrong  and I want 
[00:11:30]  to thank  the media  for just  blowing off  the fact  that I  offered  $100,000  yesterday  for not even  the original  quote  sex tape  I said  I said I would  offer $100,000  for a copy  of the tape  just to prove  it exists  because I know  damn well  it doesn't  exist  and that's  why I  threw that  out there  the papers  completely  avoided that  completely  because they  don't want to  be involved  at this point  because they  know this  is just  complete BS  and stupid  David Hinkley  this was the  biggest radio 
[00:12:00]  story in  New York  yesterday  his headline  in his radio  column says  Zippier  morning news  show is  going public  wow really  that's what  he wrote  about in  today's paper  and we had  the biggest  radio story  in New York  yesterday  Hinkley's  column  one flag  we'll get  into that  a little  later  Zippier  morning news  show is  going public  way to go  David  way to have  your pulse  on what's  happening  in New York  radio  yeah  so 
[00:12:30]  that's  so Chauncey's  quoted  saying that  in this  page six  article  yesterday  about the  sex tape  so my  buddy  Mike  from FMQB  calls  Chauncey  and this  douche  who was  so desperate  for attention  and desperate  for acceptance  and desperate  for fame  actually called  Mike back  what a dummy  why would you  do that  and if you go  to FMQB.com  you can see  this for yourself  but basically  this is what 
[00:13:00]  is printed  contacted by  FMQB  Hayden  admit it  he hasn't  actually seen  the tape  but was made  aware of  its alleged  existence  by a couple  a couple  ex-employees  of the  Opie and Anthony  show  saying they  described the  tape in such  great detail  that he  believed they  were telling  the truth  now when I  read that  to Anthony  yesterday  we probably  laughed  we couldn't  even talk  anymore  we probably  laughed  for two  straight  minutes  because I 
[00:13:30]  go hey  Anthony  I got a  sex tape  of you  I'm going  to describe  it now  describe it  to prove  that it  exists  it was  you  you have  like a  mustache  looks like  you got  a goatee  kind of  thing  yeah  is that  enough  detail  yeah  this  Chauncey  Hayden  has been  a scum  for many  many years  and you  know what  he finally  got caught  and it's  going to  get  Chauncey  I know  you're  listening  it's going  to get  so ugly  for you  and I  don't even  feel sorry  for you  you're a  dope  me either 
[00:14:00]  you're a  dope  you've been  gunning for  us for a  long  time  and guess  what  you are  so done  now  you are  so  so  done  he craves  attention  well  you're going  to get  a lot  of attention  I guess  the guy's  an attention  whore  well you're  going to get  some great  attention  now  everyone's  going to  realize  what kind  of a  hack  you really  are  phony  it's been  out there  a few  other  celebrities  have  complained  about  some  of the  interviews  that  they have  done  with  Chauncey  and now 
[00:14:30]  we got  a doozy  we got  a doozy  brewing  right now  a doozy  when he said  you called  him up  after an  interview  yeah  and no one  believed me  yeah  that was  another  lie  I didn't  say that  like we  did an  interview  back with  Chauncey  this was  early on  in our  New York  career  when we  didn't  really  know  his  character  and we  told you  he came  in and he  was trashing  Howard like  crazy  because he  was on  the  out  with  Howard  and we're 
[00:15:00]  like  well  that's  wonderful  but you  know  if you're  here to  interview  us  why don't  we do  the  interview  and it  turned  out to  be  in  penthouse  magazine  which should  have been  a nice  thing for  us  but there  were so  many lies  in the  interview  he started  like talking  about like  other radio  shows that  weren't even  on in New  York yet  when we  did the  interview  there were  so many  things in  this thing  that were  wrong  and then he  claims I  called up  and I  wanted more  attention  than Anthony  more credit  for wow 
[00:15:30]  that's what it  was  and other  things  yeah  like really  how would  that help  me in  the end  and then  he's gone  on Howard  like a million  times to  say that  exact story  and I  have to  just sit  here and  bite my  lip like  this guy  is full  of us  and someday  he'll get  his  well guess  what we  finally got  him really  really good  and we  got page  six and  the post  really  really  good  this just  shows them  for the  phony  lying  sacks  right  you can't  just you

[00:22:00]  the  quality  is  horrible  but  Anthony  that's  what  we  do  no  we  talk  about  YouTube  oh  yeah  it's  just  one  of  those  things  they  rather  just  do  that  than  go  out  with  a  camera  crew  and  maybe  get  their  own  video  or  I'm  not  talking  about  like  these  kids  did  let  me  jump  in  here  like  you're  talking  about  like  let's  say  well  there's  a  horrific  story  about  this  bear  from  grizzly 
[00:22:30]  bear  from  semi  pro  right  do  you  mean  hysterical  or  horrific  it's  hilarious  we'll  get into  it right  after  the  break  animals  win  another  but  this  is  what  channel  11  would  do  instead  of  trying  to  get  a  really  nice  clip  from  the  studios  or  something  of  semi  pro  do  this  story  today  they  will  find  the  youtube  version  that's  exactly  what  they  do  that's  the  laziness  of  channel  11  and other  news  stations  and you  know  it's  just  some  poor  little  interns  gotta go  and they  go  find me  a clip  and they 
[00:23:00]  find a  clip  and that's  it  we had a  relationship  with channel  11  why would  you at  least  just call  and find  you gotta  report  what you  have to  report  but you  can't  just do  your  homework  yeah  really scoop  everybody  and get  the other  side  of the  story  do your  homework  do your  job  none of  them do  it anymore  you can't  even just  blame them  none of  these news  stations  especially  the local  news  you know  you got  CNN and  Fox  but your  local  news  stations  they  they're  lazy  they're not 
[00:23:30]  journalists  they're news  readers  they don't  know how  to report  they don't  know how  to find  a story  that's  a lost  art  right  absolutely  and yesterday  was  that was it  for me  done  so  we got  to take  our first  break  we have  some  amazing  stories  today  the bear  the grizzly  bear story  we'll do  right after  the break  also  I got  a bombshell  as far as  this whole  sex tape  thing  that we  started  not  well  you know  the post  started  yesterday  and I

[00:34:00]  stand up this weekend  sure he will  in chicago  ah well  there's a grizzly bear  that uh killed its  uh trainer  these stories come up  every once in a while  right  of course when the  animals uh win  they win one  they were you know  they uh well tiger  emerged victorious  on the siegfried and  roy show  right  years back  never so often  my favorite of course  is uh unfortunately  uh the muzzled bear  i would like to see him  unmuzzled 
[00:34:30]  just beating the crap  out of that  woman sitting next  to him  they always do that  on when animals  attack  oh on the tv show  yeah  and the bear is  sitting in a chair  which bears probably  love to do  just sit in chairs  like an office chair  and there's a woman  sitting next to the  bear and she  is like  if you had a  bear  scope  you know how you  let infrared  and um ultraviolet  and heat sensitive  scopes that you can  see and people glow 
[00:35:00]  if you had a bear  sight  that what bears  see when fear  comes off of people  she would have  been glowing  because she was  scared  crapless  sitting next to  this bear  and you could  see it  her eyes were  darting over  at the bear  and the bear  must just smell  that crap  and uh  oh  just smacked  her in the head  knocks her on the  floor  bear had it  just starts  pouncing on her  and would have  ripped her head  off if he  wasn't muzzled  but uh 
[00:35:30]  we  I love  I love  when the animals  win  I think  the bears  don't like  wearing that  snout  no that muzzle  is horrible  for a bear  absolutely  and my favorite  animal winning  story of all  time  birthday cake  chimp  birthday cake  chimp  where the  couple  had a chimpanzee  brought it  to a  wildlife refuge  because it had  gotten too big  and a little too  wily for their  house  but they would  visit the little  chimp  and one day  they brought 
[00:36:00]  the chimp  a birthday cake  and another  chimp  at the refuge  did not like  the fact that  this other  chimp was  getting cake  or something  who knows  what's going  on in his  two other chimps  yeah two other  chimps  and decided  to attack  the gentleman  ripping off  his thumbs  eating his  face  his foot  and of course  his genitals  yeah  that were  removed  from these  primates  that were angry  because they 
[00:36:30]  didn't get a  piece of cake  well after a  good dinner  you need a  nice dessert  of course  so they  got their  cake  I bet  you know what  though  got a delicious  treat after  that meal  I'll say this  though  you can say  what you like  but someone  learned a lesson  and would not  be stingy with  the cake  ever again  I'll bet  no  cake for all  the chimps  when a chimp  wants cake  hands it over  yes  I'll try to tell  a wild chimp  no cake  for you  he'll go home  thumbless  not having sex 
[00:37:00]  limping  with no face  noseless  and his wife  had no thumb  I guess his wife  tried to fonzie  the things off  and they ripped  her thumb off  I think bears  have had it too  because I hear  they nail their  feet to the  little pedals  on bicycles  and stuff  so they  nail them  I hear they  pretty much  nail them down  yeah  or at least  tie them down  pretty good  oh a 911  call from the  bear attack  I want to get  that  oh really  well here's  the latest  bear attack 
[00:37:30]  it's a little  different than  than past  grizzly bear  attacks  and in  California  the bear  who attacked  and killed  its trainer  recently appeared  in the film  semi-pro  with comedian  Will Ferrell  officials say  the 700 pound  grizzly bear  bit  Stephen Miller  on the neck  during the  taping of a  promotional video  the attack  happened at  a training  center for  animals  used in  movies  and television  shows  oh wow  they got  freaking video  where's the  video  put it up 
[00:38:00]  so it's the  grizzly bear  from semi-pro  that Will  Ferrell's  character was  wrestling with  yep  the bear  probably killed  the trainer  for getting  him in that  dumb movie  the crappy  movie  the bear's  pissed  right  he's a creative  decision  right  I can't believe  you put me  in this piece  of crap  movie  you'll pay  someone thought  they heard  the bear  say you've  mismanaged  my career  and just  tore his  throat out  nope  it left  well  left  right  and of course 
[00:38:30]  here's the  scene from  semi-pro  needs a little  set up  this is the  bear that  killed its  trainer  come on dude  you're just  nothing but a  dumb bear  smack  smack  crazy  fish  I'm coming  with crazy  fish  this is fine  he's not  doing anything  flit  can you dig  it  jackie  move  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[00:39:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  wow  that  that must have  been exactly  what the attack  sounded like  without the  wacky music  unless that  was playing  over the  PA  yeah  I forgot  the scene  from that  movie  but yeah  he's basically  not basically  you heard of yourself  taunting the bear  so the bear's  finally had  finally had  it killed his  trainer 
[00:39:30]  spit his throat  yeah yeah  it licked his face  first  did it really  yeah and then he  probably thought  you know  aww  aww  aww  it's giving me  kisses  lays those big  bear teeth  into your neck  you're dead  he licked his face  yeah  the bear licked  his face  I wanted to make  sure the food  was going to be  good  yeah  oh that tastes  good  you know we  maybe smell it  a little bit  I think animals  they lick  and then they  then they eat  wow 
[00:40:00]  yeah  uh let's say  hi to Wes  in Alabama  Wes what's up  hey guys  what's happening  good morning  um actually  this is Wes  in Alabama  uh  uh  yeah  I mean like  it would kind of  suck if I said  alakazum  uh  are you  you were trying  to make a joke  because uh  the article  yesterday said  that we banned  the word  we banned  the word  bam  from this  radio  oh so you can't 
[00:40:30]  say Alabama  I get it  all right Wes  thank you sir  turns out  Bama  is a stand-up  guy  turns out  he's a really  nice guy  yeah  uh  so  we'll have a little  something something  in the seven o'clock  hour  sure  if you're interested  in that whole  sex tape scandal  that started in  the post yesterday  scandalous  oh boy  people are waking  up uh  not happy  today  not happy  today 
[00:41:00]  I'm happy  today  other people  are not going  to be happy  today  especially later  on today  phone number  877-212-08  if you got  anything for  the uh  the radio  show  what else  is going  on  I didn't  get to  watch the  news  or read  uh  or read  any papers  or magazines  the last 24  hours  you're busy  I know uh  I don't know  anything actually  I was even  gonna just pull  something out of  my you know  what but I  don't know  I know  nothing  did I mention 
[00:41:30]  that I was  trying to get  my playstation  I'm not very  good at those  things  that's all you  can think about  now right  Jimmy  well your  grand theft  auto video  on youtube  is getting  uh  quite a amount  of views  there  audio  it's hilarious  my face  I got no  play out of  it  yeah I know  my pretty  face  did it  get shot  but it's  youtube  so you  gotta call  the video  so basically  what you  see is a  grand theft  auto 4  graphic  and then you  hear jimmy  playing grand  theft auto  and man the  gaming community  just ate it  up ate it  up and now  our paper today  in new york 
[00:42:00]  here is talking  about grand theft  auto and how  it's based on  new york city  and all  when does it  come out  tuesday  yeah 29th  right  right and that's  why you got  the playstation  3 jimmy  no I actually  was gonna get  an xbox 360  but I got the  playstation  because I want  a blu-ray  player  I saw  clockwork  orange was  sold on  blu-ray  I'm like I  have to see  this I want  to try this  technology  anyway  and my  dvd player  was broken  it plays  dvds too  right  yeah  I just got  separate  blu-ray  and uh  the only reason  I didn't do  that's a funny 
[00:42:30]  story  oh funny  the guy told  me that if  you get it  separate you  can't like  use it online  to upgrade  this one  goes online  so I can  upgrade and  download updates  constantly  updates to the  blu-ray  yeah for the  whole system  really  for the blu-ray  there's different  things that come  out that the  player wouldn't  have that I  bought  wow  so now it  will have it  problem with  using playstation  3 I try to do  a playstation  2 use it as a  dvd player you  like uh  rewind is that 
[00:43:00]  x triangle  square  that's my  shooting button  right or is  it just a  square  no I bought  a separate  remote for  playstation 3  that you  could use  oh is that  what they  did with  playstation 3  it's a brand  new remote  it's like a  regular remote  nice I was  wondering if  they were  going to do  that because  I just got  mine hooked  up and I  think play  is how I  lob grenades  exactly  because the  guy's like  you know  good news  no I don't  know if I  got a remote  because he  set it up  he goes  good news  you can  play blu-ray  through this  thing and  he goes the  bad news you  got to still  use the  controller  which was always 
[00:43:30]  a pan in  the neck  when you  were trying  to play  DVDs off  that system  let's say  hi to  Brooklyn Ace  Brooklyn Ace  what's up  morning boys  since you  haven't been  able to  pay attention  to the  news lately  there was  in this  article in  the post  yesterday  about this  guy Greg  Hughes  something about  him and  Beyonce  have a  sex tape  about the  fam  I don't  know  thank you 
[00:44:00]  sir  we're  going to  be dropping  a bombshell  in the  7 o'clock  hour as  far as  that whole  situation  goes  Indonesia  massage  parlors  doing  something  very  very  interesting  Jamie  you like  these stories  right  of course  Indonesia's  massage  parlors  frequently  offer  fuck  massage  Indonesia's  massage  parlors  offer  something  different  they'll  rub  wasabi  on you  where the  women all  smell like 
[00:44:30]  sushi  oh no  we got  another one  of those  situations  where's that  original clip  sushi  Indonesia  who says  massage  massage  it's a  massage  hold on  a minute  alright  this is  horseradish  you're most  likely to have  come across  it  as the  powerful  paste  wasabi  that's  eaten  with  sushi  sounds like 
[00:45:00]  that guy  here's the  story  about the  massage  parlors  Indonesia's  massage  parlors  frequently  offer  far more  than a  relaxing  rub down  they're often  a front  for  prostitution  something  local  government  in the  province  of  east  Java  is keen  to stamp  out  so  dude i can't  even listen to  this story  because i'm  no  i'm just  picturing you  and how  you accent  these  like his  voice goes  up in the  weirdest  place  yes  their  accents  just pops 
[00:45:30]  up  but massage  parlors  having  prostitution  boy they're  really right  there grabbing  the news as it  happens huh  who knew that  yeah  in indonesia of  all places  shocking to  everyone  what else are  they gonna do  as far as  massage parlors  go  mint in the  province of  east  Java  is keen  to stamp  out  so  they've  taken a  step  back in  time  making  masseuses  wear a  modern day  chastity  belt  before  disappearing  behind the  curtain  with a  customer  each  worker  must have  their  pants  padlocked 
[00:46:00]  up  so  if the  pants  go  the  owner  will  know  it's  not  disturbing  because  they only  wear it  when they  massage  their  customers  and after  that  they can  take  it  out  massage  over  and clothing  still in  place  the padlock  is returned  at face  value  it's a  simple  but  effective  method  of  preventing  prostitution  they padlock  the mouth  and the  hand  from going  into a  circular  formation  you can't  quite do  the old  okay  with your 
[00:46:30]  fingers  so basically  you go in  for a  relaxing  massage  and you  have to  put this  huge  padlock  apparatus  around  your  groin  padlock  how could  that be  good  so  I'm trying  to get  a release  from the  ghost  of Christmas  past  that doesn't  sound fun  at all  even if  you're just  going in  there for  a massage  not even  for that  why would  they do  this  so the  place  doesn't  get shut  down  cut down  on  prostitution  really 
[00:47:00]  how does  it cut  down  on  prostitution  because  they can't  get into  the naughty  bits  it's all  padlocked  up  the naughty  bits  I'm  very pleased  and enjoy  working here  wearing a  padlock  makes us  feel secure  mainly  Muslim  Indonesia  has seen  a furious  debate  over  morale  who wears  a padlock  the horse  or the  customers  the hooker  so her pants  can't come off  well that's 
[00:47:30]  ridiculous  what  and then they  have to put  the mumps  wrap around  her head  so she can  only talk  to her jaw  like Michael  Corleone  take wire  for teeth  shot  and then  put oven  mitts  on her  I thought  it was  the guys  no  they couldn't  get them  I so  missed out  that's still  easy then  I'm not  paying attention  today  yeah that  like Jimmy  well now  what Jimmy  said makes  sense  there's other  options  a lot more  options  TF  do anything 
[00:48:00]  Indonesia  oh true  okay  developed yet  you could  TF  you could  pick teams  for baseball  you could  you know  you could  do something  with  ice pops  many many  options there  yeah there's  plenty  things  that's a waste  of time  now here's  how the  conversation  goes there  I would  like  to have  sex  well we  can't  because I  have  yeah 
[00:48:30]  good for  you  and your  padlock  Jimmy  you've  gone to  a bunch  of these  places  in the  past  I'm  imagining  that  that's  not the  release  they get  though  they're not  getting like  an all out  session  for the most  part  don't they  because they  call it  a  you have  here's the thing  they call it  a certain  thing because  that's what  that's the  that's what  they're able  to do  that's what  they do  you know  what I'm  trying to  say  we got to  keep it  clean on  this side  if you're  not having  all out  sex 
[00:49:00]  but the  woman is  for the  most part  she's  massaging  with her  hands  so if  she's wearing  a padlock  is that  really  stopping  this type  of thing  happening  in the  massage parlors  just stops  the sex  it doesn't  stop what  they can  do with  their hands  or what  they can  do  with  other parts  of the body  I'm very  pleased  and enjoy  working here  wearing a  padlock  makes us  feel secure  mainly 
[00:49:30]  Muslim  Indonesia  has seen  a furious  debate over  morality  in recent  years  lawmakers  passed a  bill last  month  shielding  young people  from pornography  on the internet  but an early  draft has a  clause which  could see  people jailed  for kissing  authorities  in the  tourist areas  of Batu  and Malang  also want  to make  the padlock  policy law  but local  women's  ministries  say it  isn't the  answer  and security  cameras would  be a much  better way  to prevent  prostitution  yeah exactly  yeah that's  what you want  exactly 
[00:50:00]  security cameras  in there  I thought this  story was great  when I first  looked at it  because I really  thought the guys  had to put on  some weird  team before  they you know  before you walk  in there and lay  down  yeah before they  hit the table  get your rub  down  that sounds  filthy anyway  indonesia  well they're  very  they are  I think they're  90% muslim  I could be  wrong but my  manager of course  has been there  jonathan goes  there  he loves it  of course he's  an adventurer  the more likely  you are to have 
[00:50:30]  your head removed  the faster jonathan  buys business class  tickets  jim i tell you  jakarta  jim jim  he's a psychopath  we went to dinner  after jim norton  did letterman  to this nice little  italian restaurant  and this guy jonathan  you know him too  he pulls out pictures  of his latest trip  and i swear to god  i thought i was  looking at pictures  from the set of  king of scotland  really  and he had no  security nothing  he's like just on  the side of the road  as the local king  is coming through  this little like  town  you can't even 
[00:51:00]  call it a town  a village  yeah  could have just  pointed at him  said kill him  it was  some of these  pictures were so  scary  and i'm like  wow man  what did the  government escort you  around  he goes no  i just kind of  wandered around  and wanted to  check things out  for myself  i forgot what  country he was  in somewhere  in africa  africa  excuse me  and the local  king's coming by  and they're all  praising him  and he's in  the back of a  pickup truck  or something  an old toyota  with a machine gun  and the pictures  of people just  going nuts  and he's 
[00:51:30]  unless there are  other people  behind the camera  the only white  guy in the area  yeah  of course  he's insane  he got someone  the coolest  birthday gift  ever  i can't say  what it is  because they might  not have given  it to them yet  but uh  he got  an ashtray  made of uh  gorilla hands  yes  gorilla hands  and then he took  the ashtray  and slapped  her face  with it  he's a great  gift getter  he gets you  really weird  stuff signed  right  yeah  Jonathan rules  but there's  something wrong  with him  didn't he meet  Fidel Castro  oh yeah  yeah 
[00:52:00]  he had dinner  with him  he had dinner  with Fidel Castro  how did  how did he get  that to happen  by being an adventurer  yeah  he had cigars  oh yeah  i told you this  story already  he had cigars  Fidel gave him  a box of cigars  signed them  right  actually signed cigars  from Fidel Castro  signed box  of cigars  that's gotta be  worth a few bucks  it's irreplaceable  so he would keep  them in the humidor  at David  the head of  my management  company's office  and David would  have cigars  sent to him  on the road  and uh  apparently his  personal secretary 
[00:52:30]  didn't realize  what these were  and she sent  Fidel's cigars  to the other  manager  and threw  the box out  should David  just smoke  him  not knowing  he had no idea  of course  how valuable  these things  were  they didn't  realize  until like  a month  later  because they  were in  the humidor  and Jonathan  was like  where's my  where's my  box  and he was like  I threw it out  you can't even  really talk to him  about it  because he's  emotionally  he can't  handle discussing  it  right  did he kill  her  he went  no he had to  go home  really he had  to go home 
[00:53:00]  well as far  as memorabilia  go that's gotta  be up there  oh hell yeah  if you had to  sign Fidel Castro  cigar Jimmy  would that be  the greatest  possession of yours  well it's the  box  yeah  or the box  well the box  I think  yeah  big cigar box  yeah  sure  I don't know  I mean I have  some signed  stuff that's amazing  my prior autograph  I'd probably prefer  even though Castro  is harder to get  oh yeah  but there's not as many  yeah there's a photo  with him  shaking hands  with Castro  I mean he met him  I took a cue  from your book  you have a Richard  Pryor like 
[00:53:30]  cancelled check  that is one of  your prized  possessions  it was from  yeah it was  not a cancelled  check it was a  residuals check  from the Mod  Squad  right  by Aaron  Spelling Productions  which he never  used  $17 check  so I thought  that was really  cool  and  when I was  growing up  Pistol Pete  Maravich was  one of my heroes  so  my girl got me  a cancelled  check from Pete  Maravich  for some plumbing  work  clogged his  toilet did he  old Pistol Pete 
[00:54:00]  had an odd diet  it's definitely  it's definitely  his autograph  I'll bring in  the details  probably tomorrow  but it's a  plumbing company  for some work  he had around  the house  it's a strange  for like  $200-$300  but it's  definitely a check  he wrote  to pay for this  work  end up on the  market  I know  it's just a  check that  he wrote  it's on my  wall  and it's kind  of  in a weird  way  it's kind  of creepy  it's kind  of too  personal  it would be 
[00:54:30]  bad  if it was  just a  signed  picture  or something  but it's  still cool  as hell  no doubt  alright  we gotta  take a break  877-212-ONA  is our  phone number  on the way  we gotta  find a  fine little  fine little  fine little  segment  we're gonna  do for  everybody  oh yeah  it's a bit  of a bombshell  it's gonna  make a lot  of people  look really  really bad  and that's  all I'm  gonna say  for now  and we'll  discuss it 
[00:55:00]  next  so stay  there  Opie and  Anthony  Denise what's  going on  today  I'm so  upset about  the bad  situation  with those  idiots in  New Jersey  why are  you upset  why  it's a  baby bear  what would  these idiots  do if they  were living  in Vermont  when the  bears are  sitting on  the porch  with them  they're probably  gonna wind up  killing it  yeah  yeah there  was a news  report that  they're closing  in on the  bear and  they've decided  they just  gotta kill  it 
[00:55:30]  oh man  they're actually  there's live  coverage  you can see  him scampering  through a  backyard  and the  reporter's  saying that  the bear  is crying  or  you know  sounding like  it's crying  so why don't  they just  bring it to  a refuge  they think  it's gonna  cost too  much money  so they  think the  cheapest  way to  do it  is just  to shoot  it  oh my  god  oh god  they're  cornering  it right  now  and it  looks like  he's injured  already  he's limping  I guess  the bear  got caught  in like  a bear  trap 
[00:56:00]  that they  set down  and yes  it's true  Anthony  the left  back leg  is very  injured  so now  the bear  is kinda  looks like  he chewed  it off  to get  out of  the trap  kind of  limping  along  with the  guys  following  with the  shotguns  that's sad  that's really  sad  isn't it  oh my god  they're doing  this a lot  there it is  there it is  oh my god  I'm gonna puke  oh  that isn't 
[00:56:30]  right  that isn't  right  that's no  good  that's sad  yeah it is  he's laying  there  he's been  shot  the bear's  been shot  he's trying  to get up  he's struggling  he's struggling  to his  oh god  oh the second  shot  holy  god  wow  wow  you ever see  a head  come apart  like that  yeah  oh my god  yeah it is  kind of cruel  oh my god  denise  what  they shot  the bear  once  the bear  was limping  along  right  they shot 
[00:57:00]  it once  and uh  and and  it went  down  and then  it was  trying to  struggle  struggle  to his  feet  struggle  to his  feet  like he's  struggling  all he  wanted to  do  was live  he just  wanted to  live  and then uh  and then the  head shot  yeah  that pretty much  ended it  all right  well  so much for the  bear in jersey  it's over  whatever  all right  guys  thanks a lot  all right  good  sorry well  but there  it's so weird  that you called  just as uh  they're showing  this on live tv  you know  it's so sad 
[00:57:30]  now they're gonna  need a knife  because his uh  what do they call  that his paw  hoof  hoof  is caught in a grill  it's a sin  oh well i just  want to say i  listen to you  guys all the  time and you  the funny  anyway  uh what do  you like about  the show  denise  what do i  like  dolt  in other  news  is that  true by  the way  what  our own  master poe  was eagerly  looking for  the tv  coverage  no he  wasn't  you're  kidding  right  no  no  well no  no maybe  he found

[01:04:00]  you're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show  starring little Jimmy Norton  who's ranting and raving  as the commercials play  it enrages you  right  I'm so irritated  just because  you checked  on it in the paper  but it was just  so easy  for someone  to do their  god damn jobs  these lazy  lazy  sleaze bags  in the media  don't do their 
[01:04:30]  you stink  at your jobs  you're not men  who do your jobs  no  really irritating  they could have  easily contacted  the show  and gotten a comment  we tried  no you didn't  you're lying  no one tried to contact us  you're lying  that I know of anyway  maybe they contacted some  I don't know  who knows  it used to be  it used to be about  finding facts  and reporters I guess  were proud of  getting a scoop  and getting to the bottom  of something  nowadays 
[01:05:00]  it's all about  just like I said  they send an intern out  to pick up some  video off of YouTube  they use  old  B-roll  that they shot  a while back  to do another  fat person story  it's just  there's no  reporting  being done anymore  like Jimmy said  the simplest thing  would have been  just to  hit the phones  sit down at your  stupid desk  hit the phones  and start making  some phone calls  to people  and try to get  to the bottom  of something 
[01:05:30]  but  they don't do that  because they  don't know how  they're not  journalists  they're news readers  and one of the  themes of this  fine radio show  is to call these  idiots out  yeah  we do it all the  time with local  news  we laugh at this  channel 11  here in New York  we think  we think it's more  of a comedy show  than actual news  we make fun of  seeing it  we go after  these guys  and it affected  me personally  yesterday  so now  now it's got  to get ugly  because I finally  had it  I've had it 
[01:06:00]  with ex-employees  trashing us  after we did  nothing but  help their careers  and help them  financially over the  years  you know  there's people  that have it  out for us  I get that  but why don't  you write that  in the paper  like well  the reason  we're doing  this is  because we  really don't  like those  guys  and actually  we kind of  have an agenda  we're kind of  on a friendly  basis with  another huge  radio show  why didn't  Richard Johnson  print that  yesterday  on page 6  before he went  with these lies  because it's  easier  and it makes 
[01:06:30]  a better story  and more and more  people are starting  to realize  that Chauncey  Hayden  is a hack  when it comes  to journalism  you know  and he'll get  his in the end  trust me  on that  trust me  because he's  quoted  in this article  yesterday  that he  how I read  the article  from yesterday  he said  he saw a  sex tape  okay  all right  and then there's  dope  because he's  an attention  seeking  you know  what  he actually  calls Mike  back from  FMQB  if you go  to FMQB.com  Mike got an  exclusive interview  with Chauncey 
[01:07:00]  he calls him  Mike calls  me yesterday  he goes  I'm going to  try to get  him on the  phone  I go  yeah right  who would  be stupid  I'm like  who would  be stupid  enough  to call  you back  yeah  he calls  back  because he's  desperate  for attention  and Mike  goes  so Chauncey  about this  tape  and he  admitted  we have  it on record  he admitted  he never  saw a tape  and he's  going by  the word  of some  disgruntled  employee  of this  radio show  that a  tape  yeah  if that  doesn't show  that Chauncey  has some  kind of  agenda  I don't  know what  else to  tell you  of course 
[01:07:30]  he does  and this  is where  it was  beyond  frustrating  yesterday  I go  back to  my building  people that  live in my  building  people that  work at  the building  they're all  asking me  questions  and looking  at me  and I have  to explain  something  that I  shouldn't  have to  explain  so I'm  like look  I'm not  letting this  die  so we  did some  simple  stuff  yesterday  simple  stuff  yeah  that the  news  could have  done  right  should have  done  right  and one  of them  was to  get Mike  on the  case  and you 
[01:08:00]  know he  got Chauncey  to admit  he never  even saw  a tape  and then  the guys  were working  hard behind  the scenes  and they  hunted down  Bam Margera  yeah  and we  got audio  Bam Margera  you know  talking about  this thing  he has  no effing  idea  about a  sex tape  he admitted  that he  did a couple  sex tapes  in his  life  one with  I think  with an  ex-girlfriend  and his  current wife  yeah  they're on  the internet  doesn't know  my girl  never met  my girl  he said  he read  the page  six article  and he  thought it  was laughable 
[01:08:30]  he goes  obviously  someone trying  to you know  get back  at Opie  and Anthony  and this  is what  really bothers  me  all page  six in the  post had  to do  was give  him a  call  or give  us a  call  but that  doesn't make  for good  reading  because they  have it  out for  this radio  show  ladies and  gentlemen  Bam Margera  Bam  yo  hey brother  sorry to get  you up so  early  no problem  I kind  of  I was on  the phones  all night  yesterday  and people  were saying  man he wants  to call you  a show  but 7 o'clock 
[01:09:00]  is pretty early  for this guy  yeah yeah  but I could do it  so you read  the New York  Post article  yesterday  yeah I think  it's nonsense  I mean  I blacked out  a few times  and I'm like  maybe 40 girls  behind my  ex-girlfriend's  back but  if I filmed  it I filmed  it myself  I'd never  even heard  of those  dudes  and I  would  I would  pay  $100,000  to see  it myself  so bring it  on  well I got  I got 
[01:09:30]  $100,000  for a simple  copy of the  tape  I don't even  want the  original  because I  don't want  people to  think  oh he's  trying to  buy the  tape  and then  you were  asked  last night  if you  heard of  a couple  people  that used  to work  for the  O.P.  Anthony  show  and you're  like  I'd never  heard of  those  dudes  because  it was  suggested  that  they dealt  directly  with  Bam  yeah  they dealt  with you  to get  the sex  tape  yeah  I never  met  those dudes  and if I  did I  certainly  wouldn't let 
[01:10:00]  them film  me humping  someone  and if you  did have  a tape  you certainly  wouldn't give  it to these  guys  oh hell no  yeah  yeah  not yourself  I don't  think  where is  she from  Philadelphia  yeah  Philly  originally  but she's  been up  in New York  for three  I don't know  three plus  years at this  point  as far as  I can remember  I only hummed  a girl named  Tanya with a  bunch of  tattoos  in New York  see everyone  knows you're  you know 
[01:10:30]  you get your  action  I just don't  want to  I just don't  want to be  associated with  that  I really don't  think it's true  I would match  you on the  hundred grand  oh right on  man  did page six  ever contact  you  no  press puts  out nonsense  all day long  right  yeah  and it's so  easy to get  in touch  with some  of these  people  but they  don't  report  anymore  they don't  actually look  for facts  anymore  it's ridiculous  all bollocks  big time  well dude 
[01:11:00]  you've had  like a lot  of rumors  and stuff  thrown at  you  so I mean  this is  certainly  not the  first time  that somebody's  reported  something stupid  on you  is it  yeah  can you  uh  bam did you  hear Jimmy  uh  medium  say it again  oh this is not  the I mean  you've had  rumors and stuff  thrown at you  this is certainly  not the first  time that they've  reported something  ludicrous about you  that wasn't true  oh yeah  they just type  whatever they want  yeah I  you know I  and we understand  that I mean  we're in the public  eye we do a pretty  popular radio show 
[01:11:30]  and they've  they've printed a lot  of crap about us  that we just know  is not true  it's like ah  whatever  kind of  you know  goes with the  territory  but my  my girl  has no desire  to be  you know  famous  no desire  to  to be in  modeling  according to  the pay six  article  she was looking  for some  exposure  it's probably  just some  jealous dude  at the radio  show  would you say  he got fired  I'm sure  that it's all  true  there is no  tape  right  well he's a  very disgruntled  employee  this started  about a year  and a half  ago 
[01:12:00]  and it was  so ridiculous  I'm like  no one's  going to  buy into  your crap  and then  he somehow  we got  page six's  attention  here in  New York  City  and it's  not like  this page  six is  buried in  the you know  in the  back of  the paper  this is  like  this is  pretty much  the only  page  people will  read in  the post  if they're  going to  pick it  up  yeah  it makes  for more  of a  titillating  story  if they  check the  facts  they'll find  out that  it never  happened  and it's  not as  good a  story  so they  stop  there's so many  negative people  out there in the  world  they need to  quit 
[01:12:30]  for instance  why sign up  and make  a flimpbiscuit.com  like if you  don't like  limb biscuits  and don't  like limb biscuits  go do  something  like don't  sit at home  and be  negative all  day  go do  something  people just  love  especially with  the internet  man  they just  love bashing  the hell  out of  people  because they  can't look  at you in  the eyes  right  it's their  time to  talk nonsense  because they 
[01:13:00]  know that  they won't  get caught  but if you  flew into  their house  talk to them  right to their  face and say  what have you  done  they would  have nothing  it's happened  so many times  they're the  biggest pussies  on the  internet  they can just  write whatever  they want  and then  you see them  out at an  appearance or  something  and they're  your best  friend  they come up  and shake  your hand  and talk  about what a  fan they are  and then they'll  just go back  and beat the  crap out of you  on message boards  and stuff 
[01:13:30]  it's bred a  bunch of  cowards  the internet  yeah  in Westchester  at Fairman  Skate Shop  I just did  an autograph  thing for  500 people  and a few  kids had  little pieces  of wood  and they're  like  yo man  what's going  on  do you know  where this  piece of  wood came  from  I'm like  probably  my fence  and they're  like  oh yeah  and I'm like  you know  I have to  pay for that  to get  replaced  and like  idiots  think that 
[01:14:00]  I think  that it's  awesome  you know  like  and in  their head  they probably  think like  hell yeah  I have a  piece of  Bam's fence  like  you know  I'm like  you're an  idiot  get a clue  oh that's  hilarious  sorry to hear  about your  fence  but  hey dude  how is  Steve O  doing  I heard  that there  was some  kind of  like  an  intervention  on him  because he  was going  to like  take a  motorcycle  and jump  from roof  to roof  is he  alright  is he  like  you know  is he  straightening  up a little  bit  yeah he  went to 
[01:14:30]  the loony bin  I don't know  if he's out  yet  but  when I  saw him  he was  he was  doing better  and like  he was  laughing about  the whole  thing  which is  fine  but  yeah we've  had him  on the show  numerous  times  and he's  just  I tell you  he doesn't  disappoint  on the radio  but  you kind  of  look  and go  wow  is he  on the  path  to  self  destruction  yeah  he was  on the  path  of  Gigi  Allen  you guys  are all  pretty  like  out of  your  minds  I mean  it's  like  you know  it's  kind  of  hard  it's 
[01:15:00]  almost  like  you know  Ozzy  standing out  in the  heavy  metal  world  of being  like  he's  way  beyond  where  anybody  else  was  as far  as  being  like  an  alky  what  finally  made  you  go  all right  look  Hanoi  Rocks  or  Pete  Doherty  or  Villa  Val  from  him  you know  like  they're  they're  just  entertaining  to watch  and  I mean  just  think about  if your  life was  on a  camera  all day  long  what 
[01:15:30]  would  you  want  to  see  like  I  certainly  would  want  to  see  somebody  wake  up  and  jump  off  the  second  story  into  their  couch  and  who  cares  you  know  that's  what  I  do  and  my  bones  hurt  because  I've  broken  them  so  many  times  that  you  know  I  either  need  like  Tylenol  arthritis  thing  or  maybe  like  a shot  at  Crown  Royals  once  in a  while  can  I  tell  one  of  the  biggest  laughs 
[01:16:00]  I've  ever  had  in  my  life  was  watching  Jackass  2  and  I  think  it  was  your  cousin  when  you  guys  were  at  the  rodeo  who  was  it  that  the  bull  ran  him  into  the  wall  while  he  still  had  balloons  in  his  hand  that  might  be  the  biggest  laugh  I've  had  as  an  adult  a  grown  man  being  drilled  into  a wall  by a  wild  animal  holding  balloons  god damn  you guys  made me laugh  that was  funny  he  thinks  that he's  not funny  anymore 
[01:16:30]  and he  doesn't  want to  be on  camera  and I  told him  Dunn  you  saying  that  you're  not  funny  is  funny  that  guy  is  just  fantastic  it  was  such  a  great  moment  I  mean  you  guys  really  fantastic  man  I don't  know why  we've  never  had  you  on  the  show  because  you  kind  of  fit  in  with  this  whole  radio  thing  we're  doing  yeah  I'd be  on all  day  long  the only  problem  is that  I wake  up at  maybe  noon  or later  yeah  I didn't  think we were  going to get  you on  today  because  people  are  like  7 o'clock  oh my  that's  going to  be  tough  yeah 
[01:17:00]  but I  read it  and I  was like  I'll  talk in  two  seconds  you're a  stand-up  guy  I've  heard  good  things  about  you  from  some  of  the  other  jackass  guys  and  I  greatly  appreciate  you  coming  forward  because  this  really  affected  my  chick  she  was  beyond  bummed  and  I  just  appreciate  that  someone  did  the  right  thing  for  once  yeah  I  totally  100%  believe  it's  not  true  and  I'll  match  you  on  100  grand  cool  so  no  sex  tape  with  my  girl  a  couple  sex  tapes  but  they  have  nothing  to  do 
[01:17:30]  with  my  girl  right  I  don't  even  know  what  she  looks  like  there  you  go  and  you  don't  know  these  guys  that  claim  they  negotiate  with  you  for  the  tape  no  I  never  let  anybody  film  me  unless  they  were  my  good  friends  I  like  the  fact  that  the  funny  part  of  the  article  was  the  two  ex  producers  whoever  it  was  like  we  we  got  him  to  we  now  have  possession  of  yeah  they  like  negotiated  and  bought  it  from  you  it  just 
[01:18:00]  sounded  fake  it  just  a  bunch  of  people  that  want  to  stir  you  up  yeah  I  guess  we  don't  have  to  ban  you  from  our  show  anymore  that's  good  that  was  out  there  in  the  article  too  that  we  banned  you  from  the  show  I'll  be  honest  I  always  wanted  bam  on  the  oh  yeah  yeah  every  Monday  at  7  yeah  and  we're  on  XM  so  it was  like  it was  kind  of  like  a  conflict  of  interest  we  got  friends  over  there  we  would  love  to  have  on  our  radio  show  but  it's  bigger  than 
[01:18:30]  us  Jim Brewer  is still  a really  good  friend  of  ours  and  Barry  Williams  is  over  there  now  and  these  are  guys  that  used  to  do  our  show  we  can't  have  on  anymore  until  maybe  this  merger  goes  through  or  something  I  don't  know  and  that  was  pretty  much  the  only  reason  that  we  never  had  you  on  the  show  yeah  I'd  be on  whenever  you  want  what  time  is it  on  from  7 o'clock  to end  your  show  7  till 8  and I  play  probably  3 to  4  songs  and the  rest  I'm  just  talking  about  what  happened  that  week  and 
[01:19:00]  what  I'm  up  to  it's  movie  called  Where  the  F  is  Santa  I  went  to  the  Arctic  Circle  in  Finland  and I  got the  real Santa  Claus  and I  brought  him back  to  Pennsylvania  and had  a big  party  with all  my  friends  and  Missy  bought  me a  tour bus  for  Christmas  and  yeah  it's  sitting  outside  I'm  looking  at it  and then 
[01:19:30]  a movie  called  Ming  Hags  which  is  almost  done  and it  will  be  out  very  shortly  all  right  how do  you  know  you  found  the  real  Santa  Claus  because  there's  a  Santa  house  and  it's  the  real  Santa  and  everybody  thinks  he's  from  the  North  Pole  there's  nothing  there  but  a  pole  with  ice  he  lives  in  Rovenemme  Finland  in the  Arctic  Circle  fact  fact  now that's  a fact  and  you're  going to  be  in  New  York  anytime  soon  yeah  because  that's  where  they're  editing  the  where  the  Santa  movie 
[01:20:00]  so  I gotta  come up  there  in  like  maybe  three  days  well  why don't  you come  in  and  do  our  show  we'll  talk  about  other  stuff  besides  this  crap  yeah  oh  and  one  more  thing  I'm  doing  a  movie  with  James  Cox  he's  here  right  now  he  did  Wonderland  with  Val Kilmer  and  Highway  with  Jake  Glidehaw  and  Jared  Leto  and  he's  doing  a  movie  called  Dream  Seller  with  me  and  I'm  playing  the 
[01:20:30]  yeah  no  kidding  all  right  Bam  I know  you want  to go  back  to bed  you don't  even know  I really  appreciate  this  yeah  no  problem  and  anything  you need  from me  you got  if we  can help  you  I don't  even  know  you're  doing  just  fine  except  this  check  yeah  yeah  yeah  thank you  Anthony  Anthony  always look  out for  me  although  if there  is that  much  money  floating  around  mine  may  be  available  thanks  a lot  Bam  see you  all  right  man  have a  stand up 
[01:21:00]  guy  yeah  that's  pretty  cool  also  want  to  thank  Matt  and  Joe  two  super  fans  for  really  helping  erock  with  this  behind  the  scenes  yeah  that  right  there  is  what  anybody  in the  news  could  have  done  they  could  have  just  asked  him  right  there  you  go  we  just  did  more  reporting  than  any  news  agency  than  the  newspaper  it  was  it  was  it  was  not  a  problem  especially  if  you're  a  news  person  we're  not  news  people  have  you  noticed 
[01:21:30]  if  you're  a  news  person  you  could  probably  get  that  done  in  half  the  time  that  it  took  this  show  and  the  people  involved  this  is  going to  hurt  me  because  he's  really  helped  me out  in the  last  24  hours  but  let's  be  honest  if  erock  could  do  this  why  couldn't  the  post  exactly  why  couldn't  the  post  do  just  basic  crap  and  make  a  couple  phone  calls  but  that  doesn't  make  for  good  reading  plus  the  fact  that  I  personally  think  there's  an  agenda  there  I 
[01:22:00]  personally  think  that  page  six  doesn't  like  us  whatsoever  we  know  Chauncey  Hayden  for the  most  part  doesn't  like  us  he's  full  of  bull  nagel  as I  like  to  say  oh  jeez  chrome  entertainment  org  is the  plug  today  for  the  super  fans  chrome  entertainment  dot  org  thank  you  Matt  and  Joe  you  have  no  idea  those  guys  really  stepped  up  they  hunted  down  Bam's  father  to get  a hold  of  Bam  there  was  a  connection  there  and  what  we  were  going 
[01:22:30]  to  play  for you  this  break  was  audio  of  the  phone  call  that  went  down  last  night  and  with  Phil  Margera  giving us  complete  permission  to play  it  on  our  show  to  clear  this  mess  up  but  then  we  got  Bam  himself  he  decided  to  get  up  and  trust  me  if  we  played  this  phone  call  from  yesterday  but  it's  pretty  much  the  same  stuff  you would  hear  in this  phone  call  oh  man  that's  early  I  don't  I'll  try  he's  not a  morning  guy  obviously  definitely  cool  of him  and  where's  Steve  get  Steve  in here  really  fast  yes 
[01:23:00]  hello  by the  way  we're  going  to  move  on  with  our  radio  show  that  we  do  on  a  regular  basis  and  for  the  most  part  we  do  a  pretty  good  job  with  but  this  whole  issue  I  just  want  to  make  it  perfectly  clear  it  doesn't  go  away  after  today  I've  had  it  I've  finally  had  it  with  ex  employees  I've  had  it  with  people  with  agendas  I've  had  it  with  newspapers  printing  I  don't  I  still  don't  care  if  they  print  lies  about  Ant  and  I  because  that's  part  of  what  we  got  ourselves  into  but  when  it  comes  to  people  we  really  love  and 
[01:23:30]  care  about  behind  the  scenes  that  don't  want  to  be  any  part  of  this  that's  where  I  a lot  of  fun  for  me  Ant  I  called  my  girl's  father  last  night  I  will  do  whatever  it 
[01:24:00]  takes  to  make  sure  her  name  is  cleared  and  that  people  suffer  I  just  want  you  to  know  that  but  that's  not a  fun  call  to  make  I'll  tell you  right  now  not  at  all  because  they're  they're  not  in  this  business  either  they  didn't  sign  up  for  this  the  Filly  crew  did  not  sign  up  for  this  that's  why  chicks  without  dads  it's  my  new  club  chicks  without  dads  I  would  agree  with  you  but  you  know  what  big  Ken  is  a  cool  guy  so  you  would  like  him  yeah  well  I  need  a  girl  who  has  a  lot  of  pain 
[01:24:30]  because  of  daddy  issues  right  like  I  actually  have  a  single  dad  now  because  my  girl  and  I  have  been  fighting  do  you  love  your  dad  if  so  move  along  don't  look  here  so  I  say  we  get  that  audio  out  to  some  people  today  you  know  this  is  not  going  away  Steve  what  do  you  got  you  got  something  that's  going  down  now  too  well  I've  been  talking  with  me  yes  thank  you  they're  questioning  me  in  the  murder  of  that  trainer  once 
[01:25:00]  again  I  don't  even  know  why  I  bother  okay  goodbye  I've  been  talking  with  Chauncey  online  for the  past  15  minutes  basically  just  trying to  figure out  why he  didn't  call me  back  yesterday  and  by the  way  we have  phone calls  out to  Richard  Johnson  he's  obviously  blowing  us  off  he  better  start  hiding  and  you  know  just  judging  by the  liberal  use  of  the  lol  every  other  line 
[01:25:30]  right  in  the  text  conversation  I  would  assume  he's  a  guy  is  the  biggest  douche  attention  seeking  douche  that has  less and  less credibility  every single  day  claims  he never  claimed  to anyone  I saw  the tape  just  I've been  told what  may be on  the alleged  tape  then why  why  does  the  articles  make  it  look  like  he  saw  the  tape  and  that  the  action  was  nasty  why  Chauncey  you're  going to  have  some  explaining  to do  if a  reporter  asks me  what I  saw  I  can't  be  sued  for  telling 
[01:26:00]  the  truth  I  was  told  by  ex-employees  that  there  is  a  tape  but  I  never  said  I  saw  the  tape  and  I  would  never  print  that  the  tape  exists  oh  stop  you  backpedaling  ass  there's a lot  of people  backpedaling  today  a lot  of people  backpedaling  I gotta say  it again  it would  have taken  one phone  call  but see  Chauncey  hates us  Page Six  doesn't like  us  so why  would they  do that  simple  reporting  one phone  call  to me  Anthony  Jimmy  even our  agent  who's  like a  big time  lawyer 
[01:26:30]  you were  going to  say a Jew  well  the Jew  you could  have called  you could  have called  the Jew  make my  bad Jew  you could  have called  Bob out  there in  LA  great success  you could  have called  Bob out  in LA  and had a  very professional  conversation  with him  and he  would have  set you  straight on  what the  hell's  going on  behind the  scenes  with his  ex-employee  and the  info we  got on  him in  a huge  file at  this  point 
[01:27:00]  claims  that  this  whole  issue  this  article  was emailed  to you  or the  story  was emailed  to you  personally  two weeks  ago  really  and  no  the  Rick  Delgado  article  was emailed  it wasn't  even  well I don't  know how we  got our  hands on it  let me make  this perfectly  clear  perfectly  clear  my  Nixon  impression  my  40 year  old  impression  because of  spam  because of  haters  because of  many reasons  I officially  do not  have an  email account  that is  associated 
[01:27:30]  with this  radio show  you can't  you joined  one transsexual  site  just all  spam  so  whatever  he doesn't  have my  personal email  that's the  only one  I have  so  whatever  email  he claims  to send  it to  is something  that I am  not associated  with  I would  just blow  that off  I wouldn't  get someone  involved  immediately  that's  what I  said to  him  it seems  odd  that you  would have  sent that  to him  and he  wouldn't  have  responded  a lot 
[01:28:00]  of  back  pedaling  but I  asked  me  if  he  wanted  to  call  in  and he  said  no  no  no  I  don't  want  to  get  into  a  there  we're 
[01:28:30]  going  to  continue  with  and  thanks  to  EROC  more  than  anyone  for  doing  all  that  behind  the  scenes  EROC  one  flag  EROC  you good  you had  a fun  night  huh  dude  when I  I was  driving  home  this  frustrated  last night  from Long  Island  I went  and saw  JD's  baseball  game  my nephew  and I  was like  this is  so frustrating  and then  I checked  my  black  and I  got this  email  from  EROC  oh  my  god  professing  his

[01:37:30]  Broadcast  program  Saturday Night  Virus  Hey Sam  what's up  dude  Not much  just hanging  What are you  doing this  Saturday night  Oh I'm  doing a radio  show with  you  that's right  Sweet dude  tell them  all about  it  Well it's  at 9 o'clock  p.m.  and it goes  until about  midnight  and we're  going to  have lots  of cool  stuff  for instance  Where's  my car  And Tony  will also  be there  with his  big date  Where's  your car  dude  And  a couple  of other  big surprises  I guess  Dude  And  hopefully  no more  references 
[01:38:00]  to the movie  Dude Where's  My Car  You gotta learn  to roll  with me  on these  Sam  Saturday  9 o'clock  It's gonna  be better  Saturday Night  Virus  You're checking  out the  Opie and  Anthony  Show  Big good  morning to  everybody  Got an  update on  that Red  Sox jersey  This story  won't go  away  Oh the one  that was  buried  Yankee  stadium  The new  Yankee  stadium  To be  a curse  to the  Yankees  Yeah one  of the  workers  admitted 
[01:38:30]  in a  bar  Was it  a bar  in Brooklyn  or something  He just  admitted  that he  buried  a Red  Sox jersey  in what  the clubhouse  or something  restaurant  or something  Oh in the  restaurant  area  Yeah it was  in a  restaurant  I couldn't  even get  it right  And he  admitted  that he  buried  this thing  It turned  out to be  a huge  story  here in  New York  in Boston  They dug  up the  jersey  and they  brought it  to Boston  It was a  David Ortiz  jersey  and I  believe they  put it  They auctioned  it off  for charity  on eBay  or something 
[01:39:00]  Well it's  up to about  $90,000  for this  jersey  Are you  kidding me  Well it's  for charity  It's for  a good cause  Yeah in the  end the  money will  go for  a good  cause  But who  would pay  $90,000  for that  How about  just giving  the money  and saving  everybody  the trouble  No one  cares  There's no  curse  Some guy  put a  jersey  threw  dirt on it  and now  it got  dug up  There you go  End of  story  Hey Jimmy  Moving on  You're a  huge fan  of the Cowboys  What do you  think of  Pac-Man Jones  going to the  Cowboys  I don't know  They like  bad boys 
[01:39:30]  They certainly  do  The Cowboys  love bad  boys  The more  likely you are  to do drugs  or get arrested  on gun charges  the faster they  are to put you  on a plane  They're so  obsessed  Lots of  criminals have  been through  that organization  Can you keep  track of all  of them  Yeah there's  been a lot  of  Nate Newton  went to jail  for a long  time for a  pot van or  something or got  in big trouble  Eric Williams  was in some  kind of trouble  I think Larry  Allen was a  gangbanger at one  point or he  was in a gang  I love him  My favorite  Cowboy story  Tyson Walter 
[01:40:00]  friend of the  show  Who's he playing  for?  He's got tryouts  all over the  place  We saw him  in Cleveland  actually  He came to  one of my  shows at the  House of Blues  I'm not exactly  sure  He played  center for the  Cowboys  then he got  injured  then he was  playing for the  Packers  it's hard to  follow his  career at this  point but he's  a great football  player  He keeps  getting traded  because he  makes the  other men  uncomfortable  in the locker  room and they  won't get into  why  Something about  his shower  demeanor  I played  golf with him  once on the  Cowboys course 
[01:40:30]  they actually have  a Dallas Cowboys  golf course  and it's all  just cowboy  themed  like you know  the halfway house  where you get a  hot dog and a  beer  they got basically  the Dallas Cowboy  cheerleader  rejects working  the hot dog stand  in the same  outfits and stuff  but they don't  look quite as  nice  the golf cart  has a huge  Cowboys helmet  instead of a  roof  that must look  ridiculous  driving in a 
[01:41:00]  big helmet  and the color  scheme throughout  the course is all  Dallas Cowboy  colors and stuff  whatever  I was fortunate  enough to play  on this course  with Tyson  Walter  and we're on  the range  and Bill  Parcells just  comes up in  his golf cart  to hit a few  balls before he  headed out  before he  goes and busts  a few  yeah he was  pretty calm  that day  but this  Tyson Walter  can probably  drive the ball  400 yards  just I've never  seen anyone  hit it harder  and further  than he does  really  oh it's not  straight by the 
[01:41:30]  way  you're spending  half the day  like going two  fairways over to  the right or to  the left to go  find his ball  it's like pin  high on a par  four but it's  way to the left  or way to the  right  but anyway Tyson  told Jimmy and I  a great story  who was it  the guy who  had the brand  new  was it  Larry Allen  had a brand  new vehicle  I don't know  if it was an  Escalator  whatever  a Mercedes  something  just showing  hey I play  football for the  Cowboys  and he used  his passenger seat  not the seat  but that area  to spit out 
[01:42:00]  a chew  yeah he would  just spit on the  floor  on the floor  he would just  spit on the floor  he would chew  the tobacco  and he would  use the  passenger side  of his car  as a spittoon  basically  it's a  $100,000  spittoon  he's uh  yeah he just  didn't seem to  he didn't seem  to care  no  Larry Allen  was one of the  best offensive  linemen ever  yeah  Hall of Famer  let's say hi to  Drew in O-Town  bring it on  brother 
[01:42:30]  O-Town  yeah  what's up Drew  hey I just  wanted to remind  you of  Barry Switzer  getting caught  at the airport  with a handgun  and his response  was I'm the  coach of the  Cowboys  like he should  have impunity  he's right  hey I could  get on a plane  this is no  problem  no it is  yeah  and I'm getting  a report that  Tyson Walter  is still with  the Packers  T-Bone from  Jersey  go Pack  go  thank you Drew  yeah I forgot  about that one  I'm out  alright and let's  say hi to Adam  in Connecticut  Adam  what's up boys 
[01:43:00]  hey man  yeah you gotta  remember Hollywood  Henderson was like  one of the first  guys to ever do  blow on the field  he had a little  visine bottle  in his hip  he would just do  blow right during  the game  no it was a  Vixenhaler  wait Jimmy you  know the story  oh wow  Thomas Henderson  during the Super  Bowl I think  13 against Pittsburgh  he was on the  sidelines doing coke  out of a Vixen  I believe it was  a Vixen it was  acceptable to put  that up to your  nose and breathe  right  but he was  actually doing coke  doing coke  that's a great way  to make your heart  explode 
[01:43:30]  let's do some  coke and then  get out on a  field and play  football  Richard Pryor  helped him  get cleaned up  I believe  oh really  yeah yeah yeah  of all the people  Pryor helped him  I thought he helped  him get coke  that's what he meant  he wrote a great  book  do you know what  his book was  called bro  no I don't  but I just  remember he would  say he loved  to hit people  because he just  wanted to break  their legs  because he loved  the sound  oh my god  yeah coke will  do that to you  and then of course  Michael Irvin  had his share  of trouble  that was with  the stripper 
[01:44:00]  or whatever  you know  that had a lot  of problems  in the Cowboys  man  alright Adam  thank you so much  fuck it up boys  alright  have had their share  it was called  Out of Control  Confessions of an NFL  Casualty by Thomas  Henderson  and speaking of sports  we don't talk  basketball much  but Kobe had 49  Lakers beat  the Nuggets  oh they did  yeah I know  I knew that  was the response  I was going to get  from you  sorry  what's your  do you like  any sports Anthony 
[01:44:30]  we don't talk  sports much  yeah I do  what's your sport  of choice  I enjoy baseball  I just you know  I like going  to games  I like going  on a nice day  sitting out  at the stadium  that's like  that's fun time  it doesn't even matter  you know  if the game's  really good  or not  you're just kind  of hanging out  friends drinking  some beers  it's fun  people watching  I like seeing  the guys  that go to  the baseball  games here  in New York  and they bring  their New York  Times  and they're  doing puzzles  oh yeah 
[01:45:00]  those are people  that like box  seats  or season tickets  they're reading  a book  yeah  they don't care  catching a few  innings  they're just  getting some sun  and some fresh  air  and watching a game  they're just  out  baseball's just  way too slow  for me  I really believe  there's something  there to like  make a 20 minute  highlight package  of these baseball  games  and just  I think  it would do  huge ratings  huge  just like  I know  I know  the purist  they like  the pace  of the game  and the strategy 
[01:45:30]  and all that  but there's a lot  of people  that if you  let's say  Yankees Red Sox  although that's  a horrible example  because most people  would love to watch  the entire game  but let's just say  a game like that  whatever  you put together  a 20 minute  package on ESPN  or something  here's the Yankee  Red Sox game  this is all you need  to know  not quick highlights  where it's over  in 30 seconds  but seriously  about 20  chop it down  to 20 minutes  I think  I think  you would get  a hell of a lot  more fans  involved in baseball  not that they're  they're doing  they're hurting  doing poorly  but  you know  you know  what they should 
[01:46:00]  do then  I like when  they do the  they show  the pitcher  throwing strikes  when it's kind  of a  when it's a  long battle  between the pitcher  and the hitter  and they just show  pitch after pitch  right  and that one  was here  here  here  just do it  like that  you mean  just show that  well  yeah  like a big  long  and a few  regular outs  and stuff  I mean  there's got to  be a way  to edit it  in such a way  that it would  be very interesting  you know what I mean  not all highlights  but not all  boredom either  I know there is 
[01:46:30]  a stat that  tells you how  much actual  game time  how much  game  the ball  is in play  time  there is  compared to  the length  of the game  Travis could you  find that  we had that  on the show  in the past  how much  actual time  is spent  playing the game  it's ridiculous  it's unbelievable  the down time  and speaking of which  hockey does this  by the way  hockey  hockey  when they  they replay  some of these  games late at night  on some of these  sports channels  they do like  these packages  where you can 
[01:47:00]  watch like  the Rangers  Islanders  Bruins  Flyers  whatever  but it's like  a half hour  half hour game  but they get  all the action  and all the  important stuff  cut out all the  I think it's  kind of smart  because a lot  of people  just don't have  time to  sit through  a lot of this  stuff  I do want  to follow  their teams  we should do  it with this  show  I like it  we have a  ten minute  program  oh boy  would I like  that  Flyers  versus the  Canadians  tonight  Travis's  stupid  Canadians  as he  pumps his  weak arm  in the air  yeah I know  he pumps his  little twig  his little  hockey stick 
[01:47:30]  poor little  guy  absolutely  he's been  forced to  root for a  team that I  know he  doesn't really  appreciate  or have a  loyalty to  because his  wife is Canadian  he's a sports  cuckold  yeah he's a  sports cuckold  here comes  Travis  to defend  him  very excited  look at him  very excited  listen how  weakly he tries  to defend  his honor  we're going  to game  four  oh what  in Philly  oh it's game  four  no we're going 
[01:48:00]  to game  four  oh you're  actually going  to the game  yeah next  Wednesday  with Canadians  shirts  of course  why  that's not  smart  why not  the Philly  fans are nice  no they're not  oh boy  animals  I've spent  a lot of time  in Philly  in the last  few years  they're animals  they're terrible  I know Boston  likes to brag  about being  hardcore  and New York  likes to brag  Philly  they're animals  down there  I know  they're absolute  animals  they've made  New York  and Boston  kind of calm  down  they've really  been strict 
[01:48:30]  I mean New York  and Boston  used to be  atrocious  to go to Yankee  Stadium  that's I mean  that's where  you were talking  the D cell  batteries come out  sure  and start flying  onto the field  but they kind  of calmed  that down  but Philly  they're still  just animals  yeah they're  just doing  their thing  still  what I hate  is that  they started  banning  some of  these shirts  you know  not a big  Red Sox fan  but definitely  would root  for the Red Sox  over the Yankees  because I'm a  Met fan  and I kind  of like the  fact  on both  sides  by the way  the abuse  these t-shirts 
[01:49:00]  that came out  making fun  of the Red Sox  or making fun  of the Yankees  I thought  they were hilarious  and who  started the ban  one of the  stadiums  started banning  the shirts  yeah  let the fans  do whatever  the hell  they want  how about  you ban  the booze  so people  don't see  a shirt  and then  throw something  at somebody  shut up  you non-drinker  you know what I'm saying  no I don't  I have no clue  you're going to  wreck it for everyone  but that's a funny  line though  come on  how about  you have an  AA meeting  at the thing  those drunks  you're pumping  liquor into  can handle  seeing a shirt  from an opposing  player 
[01:49:30]  and not want to  punch him  in the face  you can't  go to Yankee  Stadium  with a Red Sox  jersey  without having  your throat cut  how about that  he's being a  budinsky there  I know  trying to take  our beer away  at the stadium  there Jimmy  what's wrong  with you  I don't care  if they  go to baseball  it does  I'm sure  a beer  you know  you're watching  some of the  a beer  and a wiener  somebody get me  a wiener  before I die  I'm in cuckoo's  nest  I'm all for that  let me put it  in a perspective  maybe you can  understand  I think they  should take  all porno 
[01:50:00]  off the internet  I agree  I'm trying  to quit  trying to cut  down  are you  making a run  at quitting  that Jimmy  it was starting  to look  like a piece  of play-doh  that a little  kid had just  squeezed  and had  fingerprints  in it  oh my god  they have the  patch for that  you put it  over both  thighs  okay hold on  I knew that  was going to  tank  I didn't  get it  to quit  I got it  how do you  not love  Jimmy Norton  he's the best 
[01:50:30]  okay  thank you  fan  Sports Illustrated  columnist  Rick Riley  timed a  2000 playoff  game  the baseball  was in play  alright let's  do a little  guessing now  they like to  have a little  fun in their  cars  3 hours  15 minutes  I'm going to  say that  how long  alright 3 hour  15 minute game  officially from  the first pitch  to the last  pitch  how long  was the  ball in play  Jim Norton  only 2 hours  and 58 minutes  I completely 
[01:51:00]  expected that  by the way  Anthony  I'm going to  say  7 minutes  we'll tell you  after the break  no just kidding  don't  don't do that  I'm not  Howie Mendo  12 minutes  and 22 seconds  ok that's a  long time  kidding of course  12 minutes 
[01:51:30]  and that's why  they bring the  New York Times  to the ballpark  and a good read  out of over  3 hours  yeah  12 minutes  12 minutes  22 seconds  that's what  this guy timed  back in 2000  and really fast  about banning  shirts  we should mention  that today in the  paper  Betman  Gary Betman  NHL commissioner  you like this  Gary Betman  there Travis  I have no idea  who he is  ask your wife  see if you should  like him  she'll tell me  what I think  about her  she would know 
[01:52:00]  and she would  give  can we get her  on the phone  she knows way  more about hockey  than you do  she has to teach  you  maybe Dexter  can talk on the  phone  and I hope  she throws you  under the bus  because I know  she's teaching  you the rules  of hockey  I told you  that I've  asked the  questions  that is really  really awkward  sad  kind of  it's kind of sad  kind of gee  God bless her  that she knows  hockey so well  but she shouldn't  be teaching you  it's the law  should I learn  on my own  you should fake it  should I  Wikipedia hockey 
[01:52:30]  absolutely  that would be  a start  but talking about  hockey  faking the fact  that he likes  girls  you sell icing  all the time  no matter what's  going on  icing  talking about  hockey  and shirts  they're banning  Gary Bettman  is banning  the Sean Avery  shirt  you remember  Sean Avery  from the Rangers  yes  who was doing  that move  in front of  was it Brodeur  yeah  what was the move  again  yeah he was  kind of trying  to block  his view  going face 
[01:53:00]  to face  face to face  people are  firing pucks  close to 100  miles an hour  at the goalie  back of his head  he's face to face  with Brodeur  and he's waving  his hands  and stuff  in the air  distracting  the goalie  trying to  block his  view  yeah  look I  hate the Rangers  I hate them  just as much  as I hate  Chauncey Hayden  no way  but Sean Avery  you gotta give it  to him  I think it's  brilliant  yeah  but then they  made a rule  that you're not  allowed to do  that in hockey  right  and now  people have 
[01:53:30]  started wearing  these shirts  called the  Avery rule  Avery rule  number 16  and then there's  a hockey stick  across what I  just read to you  basically saying  you're not allowed  to do the Avery  thing anymore  yeah  well now  Gary Bettman  has banned  these shirts  from being  printed  or whatever  why  because they want  to take all  fun out of  sports  and everything  fun is being  removed from  everything  just surgically  removed  I'm a huge  fan of  the sack 
[01:54:00]  dance  in football  huge fan  when these  sack  dance  huh  huge  ball joke  never mind  I thought  Gastineau used  to make a  complete fool  of himself  but it was  hilarious to  watch at home  I love when  they score a  touchdown  and just lose  their minds  in the end  zone looking  ridiculous  and they're  trying to  they took  most of that  away  yeah  the celebrations  and stuff  that's what makes  it really  really interesting  Gastineau was  a douche  oh  when he would  sack somebody  and just  do that 
[01:54:30]  stupid dance  thank god  he found  boxing  yeah  he was  sacking  his women  we allowed  the Yankees  to say  I get pretty  crazy  I go to a  game  like I'll  start yelling  like no  batter  no  batter  wow  stop it  yeah  I've been  thrown out  a few  times  ladies and  gentlemen  Travis's  wife  the man  in the  family  although you  don't look  like a  man  Lisa  I don't  want people  to confuse  that  right  a lovely  lovely  lovely  girl  you wear  the pants  you certainly  wear the pants  of the family  when it comes  to hockey  now take us  Nate 
[01:55:00]  take us  through this  whole  Travis  all of a  sudden  liking  hockey  thing  because I  know  Lisa's  a hardcore  Montreal  Canadians  fan  originally  from Montreal  and all  that  there's not  really much  to say  about it  he just  kind of  jumped on  board  you know  like I'm  so obsessed  and I always  want to watch  it and listen  to it  and follow  it  so he  kind of  what was  the most awkward  moment  did you have to  like explain  icing to him  or something  like that  no he was  pretty good  he's like 
[01:55:30]  you know  Travis  and like  his research  abilities  so he  pretty much  self-informed  himself  like  uh oh  well I  told him  I've asked  questions  before  yeah  well  I mean  nothing  nothing  a boy's  gotta learn  that's not  the first  time that  she's heard  that  that's a  role play  thing they do  by the way  when she  walks in  with a  special belt  on  a boy's  gotta learn  oh Travis  you've been a  bad boy  you gotta  go into 
[01:56:00]  the penalty  box  he's cuffed  face down  buttocks in  the air  boy's gotta  learn  how's  little  Dexter  oh who  cares  for his  walk this  morning  hey  you gotta  stop talking  about poor  little Dexter  yeah yeah  yeah these  guys are pretty  harsh on Dexter  for the most  part  they're a  little dog  what do you  mean these  guys  what I've  jumped on  that  I'm just  harsh on  you and  your mommy  issues  but  I've kind  of left  your dog 
[01:56:30]  alone for  the most  part  I also  want to  drive a  dump truck  over that  stupid  Jack  Bauer  turtle  oh I  know  they got  a turtle  named Jack  Bauer  of course  because he's  such a gay  fan  fan boy  yeah I know  it was your  idea it  couldn't possibly  be Lisa's  no  here's a  little sound  effect from  little Dexter  oh  little Dexter  you know what  I love about  the turtle  how annoying 
[01:57:00]  is that  Bauer  owned by  ass  and off  what I  hate about  this cute  couple  though  they're  attempting  and so  far  they have  failed  miserably  by the  way  but they're  putting up  videos of  Dexter  onto YouTube  hoping it's  the next  animal sensation  video  the big  sensation  yeah  the big  cute animal  video that  everyone in  America is  going to  watch  I hate to  tell you guys  quantity  doesn't make  up for  quality 
[01:57:30]  you guys  are pimping  out your  little dog  no like  I said  before we  don't make  him do  adorable  things he  just does  them himself  and if we  want to  videotape  him  you guys  are like  you guys  are like  parents of  like a  child star  you're pimping  your own  oh he is a  child star  oh is he  yeah  what's your  favorite cute  Dexter video  that you're  attempting  everyone to  watch  oh geez  I can only  pick one  shut up  I do like  the one  where he's 
[01:58:00]  we put  our turtle  Jack Bauer  on the  floor  and Dexter  was barking  at him  most of  these videos  involve Dexter  barking at  something  so a dog  barking  wow that's  really going  to take  off  do you  check the  views every  day and  it's up  to 34  views  I didn't  check the  views until  a couple  days ago  but they're  getting into  the hundreds  you should  see how  many rounds  I could  put through  his ears  because he's  got real  big dopey  looking ears 
[01:58:30]  but Lisa  Anthony's  just trying  to pierce  the ears  for you  that's all  I know  it's alright  that'll be  easy  45 caliber  piercing  that'll be  bad  hey Lisa  one other  thing  when you  go to  game 4  down in  Philly  yeah  you might  want to  leave the  Canadians  jersey  at home  oh hell  no  see you're  one of those  people  that's crazy  going to start  some trouble  for you  Travis  yeah we might  have another  Ikea situation  that's crazy  yeah  if we have  another Ikea  situation  someone's going  down and it's  not going to  be me  that's going  to be Travis 
[01:59:00]  we all know  that  let's walk  you through  this  so you wear  your Canadians  jersey down  there in Philly  and someone  throws a beer  on you  what happens  well it's  it's not  it's not going  to end there  I'll be  throwing shit  back to you  oh no  I forgot  where I was  she's cursing  she forgot  I forgot  where I was  what a potty  mouth  well after you  get the attention  of all the  security guards  in the area  as Travis  is trying to  figure out  what to do  for you  Travis is  going to be  putting out  fires all 
[01:59:30]  over the place  I'm sorry  she's drunk  I'm sorry  she'll be  drinking  because it's  Wednesday night  so I have  to drive  because it's  Wednesday night  wait  you're trying  to say  that Lisa  drinks every  Wednesday night  no that's not  what I'm saying  at all  but you know  I have to be  at work  the next day  so I won't  be able to  drink and  then drive  home from  Philly  so she  are you  listening to  this by the  way  not at all  I didn't think  so  not at all  but she 
[02:00:00]  will definitely  be drinking  see that's  called  responsibility  I'll figure  it out  so she  drinks every  Wednesday night  so the game  happens to be  on a Wednesday  night  so you're  going to have  to drive  back and forth  to Philly  yes  I'm going to  be a very  good girl  I promise  I'm not  going to  start anything  Habs fans  are nice  we're nice  we don't go  places and  start crap  with people  we're very  respectful to  the other  team  we're the  ones high  fiving at  the end  like good  game 
[02:00:30]  you rioted  after the  first round  what happened  they rioted  after the  first round  you saw  it on the  television  oh my god  I'm so  disgusted with  my city  right now  no you're  not  that's what  you want  from your  city  and I  gotta tell  you  until just  now  I wasn't  thinking about  that  the video  is of  everyone losing  their mind  in Montreal  tipping over  at least one  police car  setting it on  fire  and stupid  me  because my  team's  long gone  I swear to  you when I  saw that  I'm like  oh wow  the Canadians 
[02:01:00]  won the Stanley  Cup I'm thinking  no  it was after  the first round  first round  and they're  flipping cars  over and  burning them  yeah like  16 police  cars or  something  they're idiots  I'm so  I'm disgusted  I'm ashamed  almost to say  I'm from  Montreal  but what can  you do  right  this will  mean nothing  but I  I've been to  a lot of  cities across  North America  and Montreal  is probably  probably the  coolest city  I've ever been  to  my god  have you ever  been there  Jimmy  a few times  you don't  like it 
[02:01:30]  I like  it  they got  that old  section  that's cool  then the  new section  is really  hip  yeah it's  great  lots of  things to  see and  do  Toronto  stinks  Toronto  for some  reason  decided they  need to  live in  the year  1967  I'm going  to call  it  Toronto  is like  the Tijuana  of Canada  it really  is  it's like  a tourist  place  that you  go to  if you're  from the  States  just to  get like  sleazy  entertainment  Toronto  no Montreal  has got  some action  no I  mean like  but not  good action 
[02:02:00]  I'm talking  about Toronto  like the  actual city  yeah  it's very  bland  the colors  are very  neutral  the  the  the  the  stuff that  women wear  extremely  neutral  like it's  like 1967  really  like the  Amish  it's just  weird  they have  no  pizzazz  they have  no pizzazz  huh  they try to  be like  a dark city  too  like apparently  they have  their own  little  time square  now in  Toronto  they're pathetic  all they do  is take  things from  other places  and try to 
[02:02:30]  put it into  theirs  and make it  appealing  for outsiders  because people  who live there  even don't  like it  when I lived  in Buffalo  you know  it was very  exciting  when we got  to do the  day trip  to Toronto  boy was I  disappointed  on many  occasions  except for  the strip  clubs  with a lot  of a lot  of a lot  of Asians  dancing  their asses  off in  in Toronto  strip clubs  for some  reason  yeah  yeah  there's more  Asians there  I think  than Montreal  there's a lot  of Asians  in Toronto  what are we  talking about  you see this  adorable video  yeah we see  the video 
[02:03:00]  oh god  no  there's your  little dog  barking at  your little  turtle  I wish you  would have  bit the  turtle's  little head  off  you know  that he  wanted to  oh I wish  that turtle  was a landmine  hey where do  you live  Brooklyn  oh you're  lucky  why do you  want a turtle  what do you  do with it  and you know  what annoys me  I say you're  lucky because  supposedly they're  banned in  Jersey or  something  according to  Ralph  oh by the  way Ralph  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  why are they  banned  are they boring 
[02:03:30]  people to death  you're in an  apartment  yeah  you have people  that live below  you  below me  yeah  and you're  letting your  dog bark  on a wood  floor  and bark  and jump  around  they don't  hear it  we talk to  our neighbors  you do  yeah  well  what's wrong  with you  yeah she does  yeah because a  turtle walks  very very softly  well the dog  that shell  and those  those  those hooves  they call feet  whatever the hell  they're sporting  doesn't make a  clump clump clump  clump clump 
[02:04:00]  as it's trying to  find its little  water dish  but what about  the dog yapping  no Kathy doesn't  hear it  Kathy lives under us  and she's a sweet  old lady  we live in a  generic  or a geriatric  generic  well you're  really  that's why she  doesn't hear it  a lot of old  people  old people in  there  Kathy also  thinks that  you're  you're  her long  lost daughter  my granddaughter  has come to  visit  Kathy stinks  yeah we don't  like Kathy  literally  she thinks  she's dirty  Kathy lays 
[02:04:30]  on her back  with her feet  up in the air  waiting for a  changing  yeah  stupid turtle  Kathy needs  the pillow  over the face  how great  would it be  if the turtle  just attacked  and killed  Travis and Lisa  one night  slowly nipped  them  like the bear  it just nipped  at their little  throat  until they  slept through it  yeah  after game  four  they're both  in a drunken  stupor  because Travis  is not going  to be able  to help  himself  and a turtle  just starts  nipping away  all night long  and you wake up  when it's too 
[02:05:00]  late  because it has  half your liver  in his mouth  killed by a turtle  how embarrassing  it would be  embarrassing  all right Lisa  I gotta say  go Flyers  you know that  but  no no  it's a good  that's actually  good for you  but you know  have fun in  Philly for game  four  thank you  even though game  one is tonight  right so you  guys got  when is game  four  Wednesday  next Wednesday  yeah  oh they're  playing them  fast huh  yeah  every other day  see when your  team's out of it  you kind of lose  track  thanks Lisa  by lose track  I mean  don't care  Lisa 
[02:05:30]  we did forget  to ask you  is Travis  affected by  mommy leaving  seven years ago  you know what  I'd say no  I don't know  if you mentioned  but my mother  turned around  and did the same  thing like a  year ago  oh to you  oh wow  oh you guys  didn't know this  no  holy moly  so I meet  Travis  and you know  I discuss  with my parents  like you know  don't go too  much into the  mother thing  because of  da da da  and my mother  was just horrified 
[02:06:00]  how could a  mother do this  she turned around  and did the same  thing just last  year she  disappeared and  left the family  she's now in  court with my  father  it's a big  mess  but uh  wow  where did you  and Travis  meet on  disappointing  children  dot com  motherless  children  dot com  oh  that's horrible  where's mommy  dot com  as you're telling  her the story  she's probably 
[02:06:30]  you know  saying oh  that's terrible  but in her head  she's like  this is a great  idea  why not just  pick up and  leave  I think that's  what it was  I think  I think that  whole story  put the idea  in her head  and she just  decided I hate  my family  everyone can  drop dead  and forget  you all  and she just  took off  did she leave  with like a  rabbi  like  no  she's actually  now my father  has reason to  think that she's  turned bisexual  and he's playing  like both ends  of the field  and she's like 
[02:07:00]  apparently living  with some guy  cheating on him  with another guy  and some chick  so  wow  oh man  why do we have  to take a break  right now  we need to know  more  and what's dad  doing  is he at least  you know  going out  no my dad  my little sister  is five years  younger  she's still  living at home  with my dad  and they're  pretty much  taking care  of each other  and stuff  no no  there's certain  things that  the daughter  can't take care  of is what  I'm saying  well  you know  my mother  wasn't doing  much of that  either 
[02:07:30]  oh wow  all right  I hear you  what tipped you  off Lisa  like you were  saying about  Travis's mom  you're like  do you believe  she left  and you just  your mom went  really  left  without any  repercussions  yeah nothing  happened  she just left  and she left  to deal with  her family  she came to a  realization  that it's an  actual option  she's happy  wait wait  wait I could  actually leave  we're so late  for a break  Lisa we're just  touching the surface  we're going to  have you on  in the very 
[02:08:00]  near future  but a little  advice from  it looks like  Johnny Rangers  Johnny  hey look  I've seen  the Philly fans  pull opposing  jerseys off  children  so if she  thinks she's  going to be  safe being a  female  I hope Travis  is packing  I can't wait  for next Thursday's  show  we will get  the full report  after game four  from Travis and  Lisa what  happened in  Philly  all right  Johnny thank  you  oh sorry  and Lisa we  got to let you  go thank you  so much  yeah no  problem guys  take care  thanks  and Travis  another great

[02:19:00]  Anthony show  thanks for  checking us out  today  thanks to the  faithful  yesterday when I  was dealing with  all that  dealing with all  that BS  and  yeah  you gotta make  believe you're  hearing this for  the first time  by the way  we do that on  this show  we already  discussed this  stuff at  ad nauseum  before the show  yes  somebody that  was helping me  out with my  situation that  has quite a lot  of power  is  Batman  yeah Batman 
[02:19:30]  oh  alright yeah  Batman  who was helping  me out yesterday  he was away  on business  and  oh I know  who you're  talking about  by business  you mean  drinking heavily  and  Batman gets  a call from  his wife  Batman's wife  and  she got  into a bit  of a situation  and man  is Batman  pissed  yeah 
[02:20:00]  and I don't know  if he's ready  to talk about it  on the show yet  but I'm sure  he will  basically  Batman's wife  was  dropping off  or picking up  little Batgirl  at school  how old  is little Batgirl  little Batgirl  like two  and  Batman's wife  had to  jump into  the car  at the last  second  like you're  watching an  action movie  like a stuntman  like a stuntman  jumped in the car 
[02:20:30]  with the  kid  to protect  and make sure  the kid  little Batgirl  was safe  and sound  and just as  she did that  and got out  of harm's way  I do believe  the Joker  came flying by  and took  Batman's  wife's  car door  completely off  the car  right off the  Batmobile  right off the  Batmobile  wait a minute  you're not using 
[02:21:00]  the real name  that close  took  like  complete disaster  so she's got  the kid  in her arms  yeah  she's opening  her door  put the kid  in  exactly  and a car  comes precariously  close  to her  parked car  she jumps  in the car  just in time  for the  other car  to rip  the door  off  yeah  which would  have taken  her  the baby  and the  door  yeah  did she jump  in the car  defensively  or she just  happened to get in  I don't have  all the specifics 
[02:21:30]  but how it was  told to me  it was  pretty much  what Ant just said  just jumped in  pretty much  like a stunt  and the door  came I guess  either completely  off or bent  you know  all the way  forward  yeah  bends forward  and makes it  very hard to shut  I don't know  yeah exactly  do you think I  stop at least  or do you know  like you know  there's more details  but I guess  that's all we can  say now  did she jump out  and go  come back here  you sumbitch  that door  is evidence  valuable evidence  and for the most 
[02:22:00]  part when we  teach something  we get the rest  of the story  on the air  so  within the year  when do we do that  yeah exactly  but  hopefully this person  will come on the air  and tell the story  because it's amazing  and hopefully  he tells the radio  audience  what he told me  yeah  yesterday  what he wants  to do  with this guy  that  almost  killed his wife  and kid  not a funny matter 
[02:22:30]  do they know  he's okay  I'm glad  his family  is just fine  was it  no  just some  random dude  driving by  not paying attention  wow  we tease this  before the break  so penis theft  panic  hit city  yes  it's odd  that this would  happen  in a place  like  in  Kinshasa  you know  in the Congo  the Congo  well police 
[02:23:00]  in Congo  have arrested  13 suspected  sorcerers  sorcerers  what is  a sorcerer  well  I know  in order  to reach  one  in  some of  my  multiple  online  role playing  games  it takes  quite a  lot of time  to become  a sorcerer  but I don't  remember the  spell  for  genital  shrinking  yeah that's  what this  story is all  about  throw cold  water 
[02:23:30]  on your  back  oh  sorcerer  we don't  know the  name of  this character  but he's  on the  show right  now  we never  named this  character  because he  doesn't really  like doing  this character  that often  even though  even though  I don't know  a couple  of the main  members of  the show  strongly suggest  that he should  do this  character  a little  more than  he does  occasionally  when there's  a chance  to discuss  with him  we're very  happy to do  but that's  how you  shrink  a man's  genitals  you throw  cold water 
[02:24:00]  on his  back  or you  scare him  you get  shrinkage  well Mr.  Sorcerer  what if  the person  you're throwing  the cold  water  on his  back  decides  to take  one of  those  pills  I don't  know what  pill you  mean  a Viagra  or a  Cialis  that would  wreck your  spell  my friend  no it  wouldn't  his arms  would  stiffen  instead  and they  recuse  people  of stealing  penises  I know  what happened  to them  they became  employees  of this 
[02:24:30]  show  good one  we'll just  stay right  there Mr.  Sorcerer  we'll have a  name for you  within 10  minutes  I don't need  a name  I'm mysterious  he is very  mysterious  he is very  mysterious  you don't want  people know  much about you  I come in  like the wind  and I leave  as such  I don't  know why  that guy  can't  as such  yeah  alright  well 
[02:25:00]  police in  the Congo  have arrested  13 suspected  sorcerers  accused of  using black  magic to  steal or  shrink men's  penises  after a wave  of panic  and attempted  lynchings  triggered by  the alleged  witchcraft  how do  these people  live on  this planet  with us  yeah at  the same  time  we have  we have  iPhones in  our possession  and this is  going on 
[02:25:30]  basically on  the other  side of the  world  yeah the  other side  of the  world  we don't  know much  about the  other side  of the  world  here there's  you know  you take it  for granted  you look  outside  look at  the buildings  being built  there's  aircraft  there's  automobiles  all kinds of  technology  and use  and right in  front of us  I mean  just the  miracle  of the  internet  and televisions  that we're  watching  and then  right there  on the other  side of the  globe  there are  people being  arrested for  sorcery 
[02:26:00]  for shrinking  people's  genitalia  and for  stealing them  occasionally  you'll see a  man with a  long overcoat  and he'll  go  and he'll  open his  jacket  and he'll  have seven  or eight  penises  for sale  like wrist  watches  but why  would he  why would  he  why  is there  a market  for this  why would  he be  selling  who doesn't  like to  have an  extra one  for the  weekends  you put it  behind your  ear like a  pencil  or a  cigarette  he's very  mysterious 
[02:26:30]  under your  nose like a  fake mustache  we gotta work  the word  mysterious  into his  character name  yeah he's  very mysterious  I just don't  know what his  name would be  though  I enter a  room like a  vapor  it certainly  did during  break when  you were  standing next  to me  sorry I  got nervous  and leave  as such  I do I  leave I  leave through  vents  he cast his  spell through  the back of 
[02:27:00]  his pants  yes I do  it's called  a pucker  a pucker  ran out of  steam  didn't you  character  pray for me  report  I should have  a name  instead of  mysterious  I should  call it  right before  you try  this  remind me  to take  my magical  pen and  jot things  down next  time  instead of  trying to  wing it  well I like  puddle of  aids  he you know  you got  I don't know 
[02:27:30]  there's another  member of the  show that does  a character  called  jimsy  puddle of  aids is  suggesting that  your name  sir is  jimsidry  jimsidry  jimsidry  that's a stupid  name who would  ever call  that  it's really  stupid  ridiculous  do you know  who had  tiny genitals  who  sam from  quincy  it's common  knowledge  I've heard  tell that  yes  reports of  so called  out in the 
[02:28:00]  sun would  hold a  magnifying  glass over  sam's lap  reports of  so called  penis  snatching  are not  uncommon  in West  Africa  where belief  in traditional  religions and  witchcraft  remains widespread  and where  ritual killings  to obtain  blood or  body parts  still occur  they're  like  groups  of  savages  they're  groups of  people that 
[02:28:30]  have not  become  civilized  I guess  right  that is  the oddest  thing  in 2008  you would  just assume  that everyone  would be up  to speed  the Congo  is a wonderful  place  if you'd like  a hat  made of  bark  I'd like  a bark  hat  I was once  there and I  said where's  the restroom  and they  pointed a  tree  this place  sucks  who would 
[02:29:00]  like the  Congo  nobody  well rumors  of penis  theft  began circulating  last week  in Kinshasa  Kinshasa  Kinshasa  Democratic Republic  of Congo's  sprawling capital  of some 8 million  inhabitants  sprawling  they quickly  dominated radio  call and  shows  they got radio  call and  shows in  the Congo  yes if you've  ever seen  Hotel Rwanda  they use their  radio shows  for different  purposes  cut down the  big tree  or something  squash  kill the  cockroaches  they use it  for genocide 
[02:29:30]  gets big  ratings  one of the  favorite talk  shows is  called  they're number  one  well they  quickly dominated  radio call and  shows with  listeners advised  to beware of  fellow passengers  in communal  taxis wearing  gold rings  beware of  fellow taxi  drivers  what  this is right  out of a  Harry Potter  novel  Congo  is stupid 
[02:30:00]  and then  sometimes the  two males  will fight  for dominance  and the  right to  mate with  the female  but if  yours has  been stolen  then you're  kind of  out of luck  you certainly  are  I think  uh  niggle out  of luck  uh  purported  stolen your  genitals  you have to  become a  corporate  lawyer  see that  make a  point  I bring it  don't I  purported  victims  14 of  whom  were also  detained 
[02:30:30]  by police  claimed that  sorcerers  simply  touched  them  to make  their  genitals  shrink  or disappear  and what  some residents  said was  an attempt  to extort  cash  with the  promise  of a  cure  who's  believing  this  police  arrested  the accused  sorcerers  and their  victims  in an  effort  to avoid  the sort  of  bloodshed  seen  in Ghana  a decade  ago  when 12  suspected  penis  snatchers  were  beaten to  death  by angry  mobs  yes all  cultures are 
[02:31:00]  equal on  earth  and we  should respect  all  America should  be multicultural  because so  many other  cultures bring a  really interesting  flavor to our  country  oh look at the  mob beating  the man who  stole penises  through wizardry  those are people  we need here  welcome them  with open arms  why  why isn't this  on TV  I gotta  explain  this person  doing this  wonderful  character  he closes  his eyes 
[02:31:30]  like  like  Gilbert  Godfrey  and then  he looks  up to  the heavens  as he  talks  and it's  almost like  his nose  is pushed  up as he  goes into  character  I'm tempted  to say  it's one  huge joke  Oliko  says  I guess  he's  oh okay  he's the  police chief  the police  chief is  saying  I'm  tempted  tempted  so that  means  there's a  doubt  in his  mind  I would  say  it was  a joke  let me  go cut  this  chicken's  throat  first  and see  what he  says  too bad 
[02:32:00]  Jimmy's in  character  right now  because I'm  sure he'd  have a lot  to say  about this  no I  wouldn't  or he  wouldn't  yeah  but when  you try to  tell the  victims that  their penises  are still  there they  tell you  that it's  become tiny  or that  they've  become  impotent  that old  gag  to that  I tell  them  that's a  great  excuse  I wish  I'd had  that one 
[02:32:30]  all through  high school  I'm sorry  I was cast  a spell  upon  it's not  that I'm  frightened and  insecure about  this and  afraid that I  don't quite  match up to  your basketball  player ex-boyfriend  it was a  spell was put  on me  well I was  in the  Congo  I wasn't  toilet trained  for too  long and  too harsh  that's not  what due  to my  lack of  function  the spell's  called the  white man's  disease right  but when  you try to  tell the 
[02:33:00]  victims that  their penises  are still  there yeah  they tell  you that  it's become  tiny or  that they  become  impotent  to that I  tell them  and this  is the  police chief  talking how  do you know  if you haven't  gone home  and tried  what how  do you know  if you haven't  gone home  and tried  it to  see if it  works  yeah  there you  go  lovely story  out of the  Congo  who's going  to the  police  saying that  that happened  excuse me  I'd like to  report something  stolen  my penis  it was taken  on the subway  by a man 
[02:33:30]  I was watching  a three card  Monty game  and the next  thing you know  it was gone  wow they  are really  really smart  and civilized  there  could I  describe it  let's see  it was last  seen with  headphones  and a  virus cap  but that's  what E-Rock's  wearing  new character  sorry  yeah  well now  that the  story's over 
[02:34:00]  what's this  guy's name  I don't know  but he's so  mysterious  it's time  for you to  disappear  and vaporize  into the  vents  yes I know  I saw the  break sign  we'll watch  you disappear  now  go ahead  do your  disappearing  act  nope  you're still  here  that's the  noise I  make  when I  disappear  I'm  invisible  but you're  not invisible  I am so  all you see  is two  floating  headphones  no we see  you're right  there  and a belt  above where  tiny shrunken  genitals 
[02:34:30]  Anthony's right  there right  you don't see  headphones  just dangling  in the air  yeah I'm  seeing  headphones  really  kind of  dangling  maybe he's  visible  just to  you  well now  that I  look a little  closer  I can  kind of  see through  you  so the  spell  might be  working  I've  disappeared  no not  quite  much to  the joy  of certain  message board  people  I think  you have to  make that  noise a little  more and  then you'll  completely  disappear  nope  almost  one more  that's all 
[02:35:00]  I have  that's it  I think we  all know  this hit the  wall five  minutes ago  well we  don't like  to stop  do we  we've lost  everybody  PPM is  down  is it  no actually  it did  quite well  yesterday  I know  but I  meant after  this bit  oh okay  yeah ratings  were kind  to us  yesterday  very kind  and very  kind for  this station  New York  thank you  wow they  might be  onto something  finally here  in New York  we've only  been here  two years  Opie and  Anthony  Rich Voss

[02:43:30]  got a whole new  batch of videos  for you to check out  from the olden days  of opian anthony  many of them  with titties  yes  there's also  old school audio clips  for you people  who want to  traipse down memory lane  also up on the website  if you scroll scroll scroll  all the way to the bottom  you'll see some  brand new  opian anthony animations  which goes nicely  with our animation festival  that we're trying  to put together  that's what's going on  on opian anthony.com  opian anthony  opian anthony  opian anthony  opian anthony 
[02:44:00]  it's the opian anthony show  we gotta mop up  we got a few things  to cover before  we get out of here  oh god  you're missing  the barb  being floating around  in here  oh  well we were just  reading about  Atlantic City  finally banning  smoking right  yep  they had these  smoking areas  down there  but it didn't  really do any good  because the smoke  doesn't know  when to stop  floating around  it would just  float over to where 
[02:44:30]  you're doing your thing  and not smoking  there'd be  non-smoking tables  which is hysterical  it would be right  next to a smoking table  this is a weird one  for me  because I don't smoke  and I hate cigarette smoke  Jimmy was just talking  about how  it's so good  to do your comedy  and not go home  smelling like cigarettes  but it's also  I forgot how weird  it is on your throat  like I'll do an hour  in like one of the  best crowds I've had  in a long time  was Clutch Cargoes 
[02:45:00]  in Detroit  but there was smoking  I mean it's just  they still allow it  in Pontiac  and it was like  I did like an hour  and ten  I wanted to do more  but it's like  you can't talk  after a walk  my body is not  remember those days  your throat would be dry  and you felt like  you were getting  a sore throat  and we were saying  remember the days  where you couldn't  even like just  throw your jeans  on the next day  let's say you just  I don't know  you just want to  like do a few errands  and throw the jeans  on you had on yesterday  you're not really  give a crap  what people are  thinking about you  and you couldn't  even do that  because it would  just smell so bad  from the night before 
[02:45:30]  cigarette smoke  but this is a weird  one because  personally I hate  I hate to smoke  and all that  but I don't think  you should  I don't know  I don't think  the government  should be able  to tell you  what to do  with your establishment  like restaurants  and stuff like that  and clubs  yeah I kind of  felt that way  and a free market  society I'm thinking  if you're a restaurant  owner and you want  your patrons  to be able to smoke  if they want to  you know then  there's other people  that don't like smoking  they probably wouldn't  go to that restaurant  after a while 
[02:46:00]  that was the argument  for a while  but then they went  after that the workers  are being affected  and I don't know  yeah  dude I'm not  I'm not a self-righteous  ex-smoker  but the tobacco companies  have been so abysmal  and it kills so many people  and it stinks  and there's  you can't  I'm sick of hearing  about smokers rights  and I smoked for 17 years  17 wow  I smoked for a long time man  so I know what you're  going through  believe me  it's been 17 years  without a cigarette  in my body  you know the fact  that Voss  says drink or drug  in my body 
[02:46:30]  I want to drill my fist  in his midget face  like we're supposed  to go god almighty  you're an inspiration  oh oh  Louis beans  you're not an inspiration  I saw Dove last night  at the comedy cellar  who knows Chaz very well  and was just telling him  that Voss is awful  and I just couldn't do it  Louis beans  Louis beans  you know Louis beans  you read John  John you read  no inflection  buy these  Louis beans  I'm Hal from 2001  well Dove's going to be 
[02:47:00]  on our show  and we'll have to  it's another excuse  to play that  of course it is  I don't know  I think he's scheduled  I think he's coming in  very soon  hey a few things  we want to just  quickly get to here  Columbo  yeah Peter Falk  is what are they  saying about him  that he's crazy  Columbo said  rant on LA streets  do you know anything  about this  apparently he's 80 years old  he was on the streets  in Los Angeles  just yelling  incoherently  babbling  with a button up shirt 
[02:47:30]  that was four sizes  too small for him  with his gut hanging out  his buttons ready to burst  looking very disheveled  and dirty  and just yelling things  out in the street  the reporting  yeah he was spotted  dazed  disheveled  as you said  and he babbled  nonsensically  to himself  he was babbling  to himself  well did you hear  what he said  he was like  there's actually audio  it was something like  hi this is Columbo 
[02:48:00]  and what are you  looking at  wow  that is  exactly  well I'm not sure  yet  I'm going to close my eyes  do that again  hi I'm Peter Falk  as Columbo  and I hate to bother you  wow  if you close your eyes  wow  you feel like  the guy's in the room  with you  it's amazing  yeah  as he headed  down the street  Tuesday  with his belly  sticking out  from a two sizes  too small  blood shirt  god I love  this guy now  he waved his arms  magically 
[02:48:30]  one witness  told the Daily Mail  of London  that he looked  disoriented  and at least one person  was so concerned  about his condition  that they called  9-1-1  when authorities  arrived at the scene  a short distance  from Fox Beverly Hills  home  which is on the tour  you take one of those  little  oh yeah  yeah  they'll drive you  by his house  they examined him  and decided that  he didn't need  any help whatsoever  really  yeah  you'd think he 
[02:49:00]  if he was that  I don't know  crazy  he would need help  that's all we got on that  I just like Jimmy's  Peter Falk  Peter Falk impression  when the cops showed up  they're like  hi I'm lieutenant  in Colombo  can I stop  bothering you  he does these  impersonations  I swear  you would think  it was the real people  yeah you would swear  yeah  um  well we got a  amusement park  going up in Baghdad  exactly 
[02:49:30]  you must be this tall  to ride  and it's the length  of a head  yeah  exactly  yeah if you're too tall  they just lop your head off  and put your  headless body  on the ride  beheading  one flag  that's a new campaign  in uh  six flags  they got rid of  you know  dun dun dun dun dun  yeah  you know that old  fogey  yeah  they got rid of him  why  I thought that was  working well for the company  uh 
[02:50:00]  it probably did  it probably did  for like  you know  five minutes  but now they got like  this Asian guy  that's like  popping his head  out at ya  it's probably  one of the most  offensive  I think  you'd think  the Asian community  would be all over  this one  no but they're too busy  going after radio guys  who are just trying  to make a few  dumb jokes  it's this  stereotypical  Asian guy  that gets really  mad  uh  they show something  that isn't very fun  it's for six flags  they got them  all over the country  uh  they 
[02:50:30]  they show something  that isn't very fun  and he gets real mad  or mad face  and he just says  something like  this  one flag  one flag  wait so  like  one flag  six flags  is like  you're having a ball  one flag  is for something  just  no one's enjoying  that's not fun  uh  two flags  also  not very fun  two flags  two flags  is better than  one flag  yeah  and notice  the kung fu  punch noise  is before it  two flags  see that's being  stereotypical  of course it is

[03:14:30]  hold on  and really  turn them off  excellence in broadcasting  our anus  what  again  oh  our anus  what  stop  enough about  the anus  ah this is  hurtful  this is  hurtful  no one wants  to hear this  on their radio  show  come collapse  on our floor  it's just 
[03:15:00]  potty mouth day  you may feel  shame  but all the same  you are  tiny  in pain  Opie  Anthony  shh  shh  shh  shh  jim  norton  shh  you guys  ready to laugh  it's gotta be the  greatest thing ever  I'd sooner have a  water drinking contest 
[03:15:30]  but enough of this  palaver  let's get the show  on the road  here we are  xm satellite radio  and I gotta tell ya  walked in  and we got two  animals in studio  at the same time  two animals  Randy Couture and  Pat Cooper  right  I don't know who  I'm more scared of  they both could  destroy you  Pat can make you  feel like a  worthless nothing  and this guy 
[03:16:00]  can pretty much  take your head  off your body  they both remove  your manhood  differently  he does it  physically  or just humiliate  you while you're  on the ground  verbally  what's wrong  Pat  first of all  you're the  animals  you and him  you and your  partner  the fucking  animals  don't start  and give us  this crap  first of all  the gentleman  on my right  Randy Couture  happens to be  a gentleman  unless he sees  an iron cage  they don't  tell you  balls of  other than that 
[03:16:30]  I'll take him  on outside the  cage  but in a cage  that's his  business  in my cage  that's my  business  I'm funnier  than he'll  ever be  but he can  knock me  on my ass  so we're  on even  terms  Pat Cooper  walks in  looks at Randy  and goes  I'm pissed  at you  this is the  first words  out of this  guy  because if I  didn't say  I'm pissed  at you  he knows  it ain't me  he goes  you never  gave me  a title  shot  how long  do you think  you'll last  in the ring  with him 
[03:17:00]  I wouldn't  last  right now  I ain't  last  and I'm  about 7 feet  away  the man  is  MMA  he is  he's the  man  and I'm  not going to  flatter him  because I'm  a big fan  of that  I only worry  and I say  this with  tremendous  dignity  and respect  that someone  don't seriously  get hurt  that's what I  worry about  because in  wrestling  they've had  problems  a guy from  90 feet  wants to  jump on  a guy's  ass  do it on  two feet  what's the  big deal  but these  gentlemen  and women  this young  lady from  Vegas  this Italian  girl 
[03:17:30]  is dynamite  Gina Carano  thank you  I love her  I would  marry in  three seconds  but you  can kick  my ass  and so  I  can't  do it  they got  women in  ultimate  fighting  really wake up  it's Thursday  wake up  schmock  why you got a  show and you  don't know what  the fuck is going  on  because I'd  rather watch  men fight  they have  women in  MMA now  Gina will  be fighting  on the  31st  on Elite  XE  on CBS  actually  no kidding  alright so  if they got  the women  involved  next step  is the 
[03:18:00]  midgets  I'm thinking  the midgets  midgets  ultimate fighting  but there are  Randy there are  different venues  in cage wrestling  am I correct  in other words  if you're MMA  you can be  excess sex  or W3L  but who's  the champ  in this  fucking world  I don't know  who's the champ  anymore  the strongest  brand is still  the UFC  they've been  around the  longest  and there's  several other  players coming  up that are  doing shows  are you still  holding a title  I resigned  from my heavyweight  title with the UFC  you know something  I'm glad you did  you know why 
[03:18:30]  because I think  right now  you've done it all  and I think  right now  you're more  important to  the game  because you have  a great name  and people like  you and you got  a nice smile  so don't fuck  around  why did he  resign  I don't know  that story  I don't know  Pat  I'm sorry  I'm trying  to facilitate  you know  everybody wants  to know  who the number  one heavyweight  in the world  is  and the old  pride brand  from Japan  their heavyweight  was Fedor  Emelianenko  and the UFC  couldn't sign  him 
[03:19:00]  won't make  the fight  happen  and at this  stage of my  career  that's the only  fight that  really makes  sense for me  I probably have  one maybe  two more  fights left  and you know  44  see the end  you know  light at the end  of the tunnel  so we're trying  to find a way  I have to get  free of the UFC  in order to  make that fight  happen  can you merge  can all of them  merge  well I don't know  if they can merge  but I think  that we need  an independent  ranking structure  so that  and then the  exclusivity  that a lot of  the promotions  like the UFC  use  rage is considered 
[03:19:30]  the number one  man  oh yeah  Rampage is  the number one  guy in the  light heavyweight  division  for the UFC  the heavyweight  champion in the  UFC right now  is Noguera  Antonio Noguera  but  who's the guy  that was never  beaten  from Russia  somewhere  Fedor  yeah  Fedor  that's the guy  I'm talking  about  that I  that I  would like  to fight  and  kind of  you don't  want to  quit  you gotta  break balls  for 20 million  dollars  you should  step in the  ring  but for less  than that  it's ridiculous  you guys  don't get  paid enough  why would  you fight 
[03:20:00]  Fedor  there's a  footage of  him being  dropped on  his neck  he got  dropped on  his neck  I want to  say it was  Kevin Randleman  he dropped  him on his  fucking neck  and the guy  just got up  and it annoyed  him  it was like  a paralyzing  drop  the fact that  you really  are pursuing  getting in the  ring  with him  you know  I'm becoming  a fan  every day  every day  I'm becoming  more and more  of a fan  and I'm  learning  as I go  here  I'll tell you  the truth  and I say  it to all  you guys  that come  in  when Ultimate  Fighting  first hit  I found  my edge  the things  you guys  would do  to each  other 
[03:20:30]  I can't  watch this  and then  they finally  got some  tap out  rules  and stuff  like that  I go  back  when it  first  started  where you  just  watched  what you  thought  was the  guy's  face  by the  end  of the  match  but now  that  there's  some  rules  in place  and some  tapping  out  I'm  really  getting  into the  sport  I think  the problem  with the  old version  of the  sport  was we  had a lot  of mismatches  there were  guys that  said they  were this  and that  and on  paper  and then  they didn't  really  breaking  arms and  legs  right on  TV  I'm like  wow  one boxing 
[03:21:00]  glove  it was weird  like UPS  workers  regular guys  getting the  shit out  of each  other  right  and then  when we  talked to  these guys  and we  mentioned  pride  all of a  sudden  everyone gets  scared  he's a  UFC guy  you can't  mention  pride  I don't  know  what that's  about  there's  an old  brand  rivalry  the old  owners  of  pride  they were  the biggest  brand  in Japan  which is  a huge  market  for the  sport  and then  here in  the US  the strongest  brand  has been 
[03:21:30]  the UFC  for a long  long time  so there  was always  this rivalry  and that's  kind of where  the Fedor  fight comes  from too  because he  was the  heavyweight  champion  of pride  who's got  the best  fighters  they had  a little  bit  different  rules  they fight  in a  ring  we fight  in a  cage  we can  drop  elbows  they can  soccer  kick  and stomp  it was  all these  questions  that were  being asked  and now  the UFC  bought the  pride  brand  and kind  of killed  the brand  and a lot  of those  fighters  are now  coming over  Noguera  he's the  heavyweight  champion  now in the  UFC  he was a  pride  fighter  Rampage 
[03:22:00]  was a  pride  fighter  several  other  former  pride  fighters  have come  over  Henderson  Crow  Cop  others  and not  fared well  but some  of them  have  it's amazing  Randy  you really  are a  legend  in that  you've  beaten  everybody  you were  one of  the three  that Liddell  wanted to  have  you've  fought  everybody  there's  nobody  you seem  to be  afraid  of  I've  had  an  amazing  ride  in the  sport  it's  been a  blast  and  I've  had  some  great  fights  and  fought  some  very  tough  guys  it's 
[03:22:30]  been  a lot  of  fun  who  hits  the  hardest  it's  hard  to say  the  interesting  thing  about  being  knocked  out  is  you  don't  remember  a lot  and  Chuck  managed  to  knock  me  out  in  the  rematch  so  he must  hit  pretty  hard  is  Chuck  still  in  the  game  yeah  Chuck  still  fighting  he was  supposed to  fight  Rashad Evans  coming up  but sustained  a hamstring  injury  I think  and pulled  out  oh  in  England  right  I  think  it  was  going  to  be  in  England  the  difference  between  Randy  and  Chuck  they're  both  animals 
[03:23:00]  you  just  look  at  me  you  know  they're  a  major  problem  but  what  I  like  about  Randy  he  actually  smiles  which  is  good  a little  more  a little  more  human  Chuck  we love  Chuck  he does  our show  all the  time  but  man  that  guy  does  not  smile  we  just  want  him  to  crack  one  smile  he  just  sometimes  he gets  really  quiet  you  just  hear  him  breathing  it's  like  a  bull  just  breathing  through  this  fucking  savage  face  yeah  just  amazing  what's  this is  probably  hack  but  what's  the  worst  injury  you had  doing  the  ultimate 
[03:23:30]  fighting  thing  a  few  years  ago  I  was  fighting  Rico  Rodriguez  back  when  I  was  originally  a  heavyweight  and  I  caught  an  elbow  in  the  fifth  round  of  the  fight  and  fractured  the  lemur  paprichia  the  thin  bone  between  your  sinuses  and  your  eye  socket  which  wasn't  fun  that  took  a  while  to  heal  and  in  my  last  fight  I  broke  my  ulna  my  left  arm  and  the  eye  thing  was  worse  than  breaking  an  arm  oh  yeah  a lot  worse  why  just  your  vision  you're  messing  with  your  vision  and  your  eyes  that's  never  a good  thing  did  you win 
[03:24:00]  the fight  you broke  your  moment  yes  it  that  was  amazing  to me  I thought  so  it was  Gonzaga  who was  the guy  that knocked  out  Mirko  Krokop  who everybody  thought was  unbeatable  me too  I was  fucking  Billy  bandwagon  on this  guy  I'm like  no one  will ever  beat him  because the  shit kicked  out of him  but you were  blocking a  kick  and had your  arm broken  and you won  the fight  let me tell you  what happens  let's say  during a break  one of us  walks to the  bathroom  and we  twist an  ankle  the show's  over  we go home  to think  you continued  fighting  and won  the fight  with a 
[03:24:30]  broken arm  do you think  the guys  don't get  hurt as bad  as in boxing  a couple guys  have gotten  killed  because they're  taking 45  minutes of  punishment  but you guys  are pretty much  I mean the  fights don't go  that long  because there's  the threat  of an arm  break  and it's  done  well I think  the wrestling  and submission  aspect of  the sport  it's in the  referee's hand  he's the most  dangerous guy  if you don't  know his job  he's got to  know  because let me  tell you  the last time  I was in the  cage  I didn't  tap out  I went  gay  so I don't 
[03:25:00]  fuck around  I don't wait  for the referee  to control  my fucking  life  stay where  you are  why  it's over  this is  what I  worry about  you've got  some great  referees there  because if  they don't  jump in  in time  and it's  it could  be dangerous  that's why  I look at  the referee  you guys  don't mean  nothing anymore  you're out  of the  fucking  picture  we go  there to  see the  referees  see if  they're  going to  know  you guys  I'm waiting  for one  guy to pick  the referee  up and show  him out of  the fucking  cage  you're absolutely 
[03:25:30]  right  we've had  no deaths  in the 14  years that our  sport's been  around in the  US market  and that's  a great track  record to have  we don't get  to sustain  pounding to  the head  that boxing  sustains  because of the  wrestling aspect  the grappling  aspect of the  sport  it makes it  really hard  to watch  boxing when  you start  getting into  the ultimate  fighting game  I still  love boxing  I don't  know a  mixed  martial  artist  that isn't  training  in boxing  it's a piece  of what we  do  but when you 
[03:26:00]  see the  boxing  you know  the feet  aren't coming  up or  nothing  no arrows  it's all  just  I think  the other  dimensions  of our  sport  you kind  of made  the sport  look dated  people would  argue  old school  and say  you've got  to be out  of your  mind  but that's  my take  on it  anyway  cage  wrestling  has hurt  boxing  in my opinion  because cage  wrestling  is  this is  like  you want  to fuck  with me  in boxing  you jab  you step  away  you dance  around  you go  in the  corner  you talk  to the  guy 
[03:26:30]  you get  a minute  rest  you get  up  again  the  12 rounds  are over  then the  guy says  I don't  know  I could  have  beat him  who gives  a shit  now hey  what about  the  welterweight  champ  who turns  around and  knocks out  this 300  pound  wrestler  give me a  break  what's his  name  where to be  where to work  where to be  shit  what do you  do that  because you  ruin your  reputation  he's over  there hitting  us 300  pound  are you  nuts  this guy  can pick  him up  and bend  him in  seven  pieces  so this  guy who's 
[03:27:00]  a great  fighter  no question  but he's  a great  defensive  fighter  this guy  Mayweather  I don't  understand  because there's  so many  fucking  Mayweather  I don't  know which  one  is  so anyway  Randy we had  enough of you  goodbye  we have  Mayweather on  the show  and of course  you should be  scared of  Mayweather  right  but we're  more scared  of his  entourage  you're dealing  with guys  that are so  inoritous  man that  they over  protect him  and he's  the fighter  what the fuck  does a fighter  need a bodyguard  why would Randy 
[03:27:30]  need a bodyguard  who the fuck's  going to fight  with this guy  these guys were  pay attention  what about your  partner  he doesn't even  breathe anymore  you know  you're absolutely  right  I had a little  dilemma at the  house  my alarm went  off so I had  to make sure  somebody was  over there  taking care of  it  it happens  are you nasal  to me  no  are you ever  cold on the  head  no  maybe it's  my hearing  game  let's get back  to talent  I'll try to 
[03:28:00]  stop that  Anthony also  has guns  like Randy  but they're a  little different  so you know  he's well  prepared for a  home invasion  well you know  you gotta be  prepared  if you can't  be prepared  you know  with muscles  and stuff  you gotta have  superior firepower  yeah Pat  you gotta talk  to Anthony  you gotta  you got any  pieces there  you're Italian  you gotta own  a gun  right  it's the law  let me tell you  something  yes sir  I don't fight  with nobody  we discuss  things  I don't fucking  raise my hands  to nobody  unless you know  what you're doing  if I raise my 
[03:28:30]  hands to somebody  I'm gonna kill you  that's the way  it is  because my father  says don't make  a bullshit  when you raise  your hands  I killed  the motherfucker  so this is what  you do  I don't raise  I'm a gentleman  someone says  you're out of order  I apologize  I ain't looking  for any fucking  problem  that's why  I went gay  last Thursday  now I'm looking  for someone  to unday me  I'll see you  Thursday  in my place  Randy  people don't  fuck with you  unless they're  looking for a  lawsuit  like there's  there's guys  that would do  that's probably 
[03:29:00]  their bodyguards  because you know  Mayweather's making  20 million  a fight  I take the beating  for the suit  I mean that's  what people  those guys  see you as a mark  that you know  the rest of your  life is in danger  you really have  no  you have to  defend yourself  I got  lots of money  I got lots of  money  this isn't great  I threw them  and I got money  let's go to the  circus  you're shitting  into a bag  for the rest of your 
[03:29:30]  life  not worth it  good point  hey what are we  promoting today  Randy  red belt  red belt  what's that  about  it's a  Sony classic  picture  written and  directed by  David Mamet  Chiwetel  Edgeford's  the lead  character  the backdrop  of the movie  is mixed  martial arts  it's a  well written  typical  Mamet movie  with some  subversion  and some  things in it  not just a  fight movie  it is a  really cool  fight  kind of  an American  samurai story  this is your  first acting  seventh picture  but the last  couple I've been  trying to steer away 
[03:30:00]  from just the  thuggish fight  roles and do  some more  serious acting  obviously you  can't fight  forever  so  who do you  play in this  movie  I play an  announcer  Dylan Flynn  that ends up  fighting somebody  come on  no actually I  don't fight in  this movie  is that part of it  you like it  I don't want to  do the role  but  yeah I was  interested first of  all because it's a  mammoth movie  I mean he's  fantastic  and I love the  plot of the  story and it  wasn't about the  fighting for me  I would love to have 
[03:30:30]  had Voss in here  though because our  friend Rich Voss is  a really bad  actor  he took martial  arts and I  don't want to  ask him to  spar but I  wanted to ask him  to throw a kick  or something for  you just to  observe and see  because he really  thinks that he  knows the martial  arts and we  just know that  he's just a  fucking deluded  idiot and he's  someday going to be  killed trying to  fight for a little  man  we could have  Pat Cooper do  some of his  kung fu moves  for everybody  Pat  let me tell  you I like  Chinese food  that's as far  as I go with  fucking kung fu  and mixed  martial arts  like a mixed  salad 
[03:31:00]  all this  bullshit  so much  fucking  confusion  everybody's  beating the  shit out of  each other  now he's  going into  the movie  business  watch  if he  dances with  the stars  I'm fucking  getting out of  it's about time  he laughs  this guy  he's got a  great smile  a great laugh  it's about time  you know  you've been  working him  for a few  minutes  he's a man  of all season  but it's raining  a lot  that's your  problem  very very good  so you're not  afraid of  Fedor 
[03:31:30]  no not at all  I think I  you can't be  afraid of anybody  if you're going  to get in that  cage  no yeah  you have to  go in  you mean people  going in the cage  are afraid  some guys are  you can see that  what the hell  are they going  in the cage for  yeah exactly  are you crazy  you see it in  their eyes  that must be  something when  you see it  in their eyes  and just go  oh I'm going  to beat the  shit out of you  yeah sometimes  you can tell  you can just  say oh  you can see  the doubt  and fear  in a guy's  face  oh god  that's like  when Steve  tries to produce 
[03:32:00]  that's when  you can get  hurt  if they don't  know what  you're doing  thank you  yeah I heard  hey we got  some Randy  fans on the line  here let's  say hi to  Jason in  New Jersey  Jason what's  up  hey what's  going on  fellas  hey Jason  I just wanted  to say I  saw an old  episode of  pros vs  Joes  they had  Randy on  it and  before the show  they introduced  all the guys  so all the  athletes are coming  out and every  guy that came  out before him  all the people  are sitting  there trash  talking them  left and  right Randy  comes running  out I swear  to Christ at  least two of  the contestants  pulled a big  nagel in their  pants when they  were sitting  there trying to 
[03:32:30]  watch Randy  come out I  mean their  jaws dropped  out  have you guys  watched pros  vs Joes  it's a pretty  amazing show  what do you do  for pros vs  Joes  yeah they  actually put us  in a cage  we did a  five minute  submission round  with each of  the contestants  were you told  not to hurt  the guy  well I think  it's a big  thing for the  producers  they don't  want anybody  seriously injured  so you know  you know the  concept  Jimmy you know  the concept  right  pro athletes  go home  and get a  fucking job  who wants to  jump in with 
[03:33:00]  this guy  how can his  man control  himself  you know  with the  producer  the guy  kicks him in  the balls  what's he  going to do  sit there  and start  to tweet  tweet  he's going  to break  his fucking  back  it's very  hard to  control you  because you're  in that  environment  it wasn't  bad  I saw  when you  were trying  to hit him  don't give  a shit  Randy  you know  pros versus  Joes  if it's like  you shooting  free throws  with LeBron  James  or taking  on the  badminton  champion  of the world  badminton  but going  in a ring  with an  ultimate fighter 
[03:33:30]  and you're  a regular  Joe  you've got  to be  insane  a porno  chick  I would  do that  with  I dare  you to  suck  my dick  how long  did somebody  actually last  with you  I went  five minutes  with each  of the guys  it was who  got submitted  the least  amount of  times in  five minutes  what number  was that  852  five six  and seven  so the guy  that only  got submitted  five times  I think  won that  event  five times  in how many  minutes  again  five minutes  aren't you  supposed to  have something  with  is it Kurt 
[03:34:00]  Angle  Kurt Angle  has been talking  about getting  into MMA  for quite a while  and I have the  opportunity to  potentially do  a submission  match with him  this summer  after I'm free  from the UFC  so I'm hoping  to get a chance  to do that  I'd love to  choke the shit  out of him  oh I like that  you would  right  there's also  audio of him  I think it was  Angle  kind of like  talking about  how he thinks  he would do  very well  and Liddell  said that if  we fought  he's never  been hit  like I'll  hit him  that's actually  true  Kurt has a 
[03:34:30]  great wrestling  pedigree  he's a collegiate  wrestler  and he hasn't  done that  for years  he was an  Olympic champion  he comes  from a great  wrestling background  but I mean  we just saw  Brock Lesnar  who's also  a very very good  wrestler and how  he fared  making the  transition to  MMA and jumping  in with a top  guy right out  of the gates  he didn't last  very long  so I think  Kurt has  potential if he  wants to do  the work and  train and learn  the things he  needs to learn  to be a  complete fighter  but to just  jump in with  his wrestling  pedigree at  this point  he's going to  get his butt  whooped  did Mare beat  that guy with  the beard 
[03:35:00]  he did  Mare beat him  he beat him  because the guy  with the beard  is suffocative  in crisis  I don't want to  get in a wrestling  match with this  guy that  god damn  beat  electrocutes you  electrocutes  why is it  he never had  a fight  and the first  one was a  main event  but Mare beat  him right  and PJ  did he win  out in London  LJ  the guy from  Hawaii  oh BJ Penn  yes he did  not a great  guy  not a great  guy  I don't think  I know what  I'm talking  about  how do you  know so much  about this  let me tell  you something  listen to me  when you're  not working  you read 
[03:35:30]  but you may  get lucky  and wind up  on this  fucking show  how about  Kimbo Slice  he's a great  street fighter  a legendary  street fighter  on YouTube  black dude  really a tough  fucking dude  bare knuckle  street fighter  getting involved  in  he's with  Elite XC  well Mare beat  him right  he's trained  no Mare hasn't  fought Kimbo  Kimbo hasn't  fought any  top ten guys  yet  they're wisely  choosing his  opponents  and bringing him  along I think  given some time 
[03:36:00]  he's going to be  a very very good  mixed martial artist  oh really  but right now  he's still  predominantly a striker  he's working  on his ground  skills  he's working  a lot  with Boss  Rutten  who's a legend  in the sport  he trained  with us  for a while  on the extreme  tour in Vegas  but great  attitude  nothing like  what you would  think  seeing the  street fighting  videos  he's a  very nice  guy  very quiet  and just  comes in  hard nosed  asks a lot  of questions  and works  hard in the  gym  so that tells  me he's got  the right idea  he knows  he's not  just going  to walk  in and beat  the shit  out of 
[03:36:30]  everybody  so you guys  don't resent  him  I sense a little  resentment  you talk about  Kurt Angle  almost like  you don't  fucking come  in with that  I'm a star  wrestler shit  no because  Kimbo doesn't  come in that way  I mean he comes  out and fights  he's not scared  of anybody  but I think  he's the first  one to say  look I don't  know everything  there is to  know in this  game I'm still  learning I mean  I've heard him  do his interviews  he doesn't come  in thinking  oh I'm just  going to fuck  everybody up  he doesn't act  that way  so I got no  issue with Kimbo  I think I hope  that Elite XC  doesn't take the  street fighting video  and use that to  market him because  I don't think 
[03:37:00]  that helps the  sport but he's  got a ton of  potential  he seemed like  a nice guy as  he was picking  people up off  the pavement  you've seen him  fight right  of course you  have  I was picked  up off the  pavement but  not for that  reason  let's go to  the phones we  got a bunch of  Randy fans checking  in we got Bill  in Kansas  Bill what's up  hey Randy huge  fan man I just  wanted to know  if there's a  beef between you  and Dana  just being blown 
[03:37:30]  out of  person  Dana White  well I've got  no beef with  Dana  Dana's Dana  I've been around  Dana for seven  years now I  know he's a  passionate guy  about the sport  and he's very  protective of his  brand and I  think sees me as  a threat because  I resigned from  the UFC and so  he's said some  inflammatory things  but I don't take  it personal and  in the long run  it all works out  and hopefully  we'll change some  things in the  sport and make it  better but that's  just Dana  he's gonna say 
[03:38:00]  things like that  and do things  like that  what did he say  I have no idea  what he  he's made a lot  of things  he's said a lot  of things publicly  about me because  they obviously want  me to continue  to compete for  the UFC and it  doesn't make a lot  of sense for me  right now so  he's called me  this and that  and it's not  even worth  repeating  is Fedor  a good one  I'm not even  going to push  that one  you're not  fighting as a  UFC fighter  then if you  fight Fedor  are you fighting  under Pride  or are you guys 
[03:38:30]  just kind of  both going solo  Pride's gone  the UFC bought  Pride and basically  killed the brand  so it'll happen  somewhere else  we don't know  where it's going  to happen yet  Mark Cuban  is a third  party stepped up  and is helping  me file with  the state of  Nevada to get  a declaration  on my contract  and see what  the state thinks  about when I'm  free and clear  of the UFC contract  Mark Cuban rules  by the way  so he's helped  me tremendously  in that regard  and we'll see  where the fight  turns up  but it's going  to happen  that's great  man  hey let's  get Mars in 
[03:39:00]  here  he's a huge  fan before  let Randy go  Ron in Georgia  what's up  I had a question  for Randy  yes  what's up Ron  you saw  the human weapon  on Discovery Channel  yes  and they done  a test  where you  you exert yourself  for like five minutes  and a normal person  the creatine levels  went sky high  and they got exhausted  you were exact opposite  what are you  superman or something  no  they had a little  trouble explaining  why my lactic acid 
[03:39:30]  levels decreased  when I was doing  that kind of work  I think  they determined  that I used  my body naturally  through training  kind of adjusted  which muscle groups  were doing the work  and I've managed  to become more  efficient  to eliminating  that lactic acid  that builds up  when your muscles  work  which was kind  of unique  and surprised  surprised me  as well  that was the show  where I didn't see it  but I've heard  a lot about it  where they tested  you guys  like how hard 
[03:40:00]  you can punch  and all that  right exactly  fight science  I heard it's a great show  yeah very cool  they did an amazing job  it was really cool  to get all the guys  together  and do the testing  with the crash test  dummies and stuff  we had a really good time  do you do the elliptical  as well  I found that to be  very helpful  I have a little trouble  getting my heart rate  up on the elliptical  I go to an air diner  or use the treadmill  a lot  we do sprints  on the treadmill  how many push-ups  can you push out there  I don't know  I haven't done push-ups  I'm good for 50  we should try to do  a manly thing 
[03:40:30]  with Randy  I don't think so  put on dresses  and hand our phone numbers  over  Pat an idea  maybe something manly  we could do  with Randy  the only muscle  is on my tongue  if I can't lick it  it's all over  that's the facts  all these guys  with muscles  and break and things  when I get out of bed  that's my push-up  when I get back in bed  that's another push-up  I don't give a shit  about my muscles  about my legs  I ain't running  around the corner  I don't give a fuck  I just want to exist  when I'm breathing 
[03:41:00]  I'm alive  this guy's got to  fight beat the shit  of the people  I'm a multi-millionaire  without raising  my fucking hands  there you are  you step outside  you I can take  are you a multi-leader  maybe I can't  maybe I'm probably  shit to you  I don't know  do you exercise  at all Pat  you've never  got into exercising  I don't exercise  I was a bricklayer  for 12 fucking years  bending down  lifting a block  bending down  breaking a block  why should I go  after that  after 12-15 years  that was my muscles  into this world  it's fucking over 
[03:41:30]  I don't lift up  my coffee cup  any fucking more  I don't want  to be involved  I don't go  in his business  he better stay  out of my fucking business  he starts getting funny  it's a problem  Randy that's a threat  by the way  he doesn't know  that I know  little Al  and peculiar Mary  that old fuck  his brains up  hey Mars is a big fan  Mars in studio  martial artist  hey Randy  we spoke earlier  did you give him  like a sign of respect  he's got a little something  we spoke earlier  and Pat covered 
[03:42:00]  a lot of stuff  I'm surprised  that you know  so much of it  and so does Jim  but I do have  one question  we all are looking forward  to you fighting Fedor  win or lose  if Fedor wins or lose  with Tim  that's the fight  you and him  you got a top  no matter what  even if you lose  with Tim  you're the top man  but there is another guy  that I forgot to ask you about  how about Josh Barnett  how about  trying to get that win back  Josh signed with Affliction  that show is happening  that's where Tim and Fedor  are fighting  July 19th 
[03:42:30]  there will be a huge show  it's a great  bunch of heavyweights  Josh is getting a rematch  with Pedro Hizo  who was one of his losses  from back in the day  I know Josh real well  and it was my first loss  in the UFC  was against Josh  he's a great fighter  you know  went to Japan  since then  and fought a lot  in pride and stuff  and it's been hot and cold  but it's still  I think for a big guy  moves really really well  great submission guy  so I mean  there's a possibility there  because the other guy  that's also  probably that you would like 
[03:43:00]  but right now  he's not doing so well  is Rico Rodriguez  and I think that's where  you got the injury  yeah I had the fracture  yeah to the eye  yeah Rico's  Rico's trying to get himself  back on track  he's  I think he's speaking French  oh god  no go  go go  yeah he's still around  still kind of trying  to climb back in shape  and compete again  at a high level  and it'll be interesting  to see how that goes for him  I have a question  I smell another  Saturday virus show  yeah  Mars  that no one will listen to  go ahead Mars  go ahead though Mars 
[03:43:30]  it's very interesting  I wanted to ask you  do you like or dislike  Tito  because I've gotten  a weird vibe  from Chuck about him  weird vibe  yeah  you're making it sound vague  he can't stand him  well Jimmy's not sure  if Randy might hang out  with Tito  I've always gotten  along with Tito  and I think you know  going into a fight  with Tito  he's going to talk shit  he's going to talk smack  that's just how he operates  so I wasn't offended  you know he came out  with a cane 
[03:44:00]  he did all kinds of stuff  because of my age  oh shit  what a fucking smart ass  I kind of expected that  and gave a little of it  back to him  which I think  caught him off guard  outside of the limelight  he's actually  a very nice guy  what was the result  of the fight  I'll tell you  who's finished  he literally got a spanking  did he get a spanking  Shamrock  he lost to the Oriental kid  a couple of weeks ago  Shamrock  what is it  I don't know  which one is  Franky Shamrock  Kung Lee  and Frank Shamrock  it was a great fight  what was it  this guy outboxed him  he did everything 
[03:44:30]  but hit him with chopsticks  yeah you're right  I'm serious  because I think Shamrock  at one time  you know  but I think his days are over  and I think he should  back away for a while  and go into the nunnery  the nunnery  the convent  hey Randy  is the money getting better  I think that's one of the things  that needs to change  in our sport  the contracts are very exclusive  they own the fighters  from top to bottom  and that's why  I've got to leave the UFC  to make the Fedor fight happen  the top fighters  should be allowed  to fight each other  and you know 
[03:45:00]  everyone says  oh you're kicking the hell  out of boxing  well  that's not exactly true  you know  I think last year  all the MMA fighters  combined in the pay-per-views  for the UFC  got paid $17 million  Mayweather's made more than that  in one damn fight  so it's not exactly accurate  but it's becoming  more and more mainstream  and I would assume  that would bring  a lot more dollars  to the sport right  well  we hope that  some of these new promotions  coming up  want to pay the fighters better  and give  you know  the lion's share  of those fights  back to the fighters  instead of keeping it in house 
[03:45:30]  go on strike  go on strike  the night of the big fight  so we ain't going  in that fucking cage  I want to see millions  on the table  then you're afraid  whatever the head  of the UFC  ABCDF  who don't fucking like it  fuck him  and I think  well you don't own my life  who the fuck's taking  these punches  you sick bastards  you must make it  the man see  you're tough in the ring  outside  you're not  you're a pussy  step inside  that's what he's doing now  that's how come  he's not part of the UFC anymore  that's part of what  Randy's doing  he's fighting  how come this guy's behind me 
[03:46:00]  who the fuck is this guy  I thought you were  throwing your voice  plus it's a new sport  compared to boxing  I mean it's amazing  how fast it's going  it's still growing  right  because of guys like you  and Chuck  who become like these faces  for the sport  people like becoming  and you have to give UFC  credit where credit is due  they've changed the face  of the sport  you know the TV show  the first season  that Chuck and I worked on  that changed the landscape  for mixed martial arts  I got a question  what bothers me 
[03:46:30]  on pay per view  what happens in boxing  a week later  you see the pay per view  fight on regular television  why isn't that happening  on the MMA  and all these pride shows  why do we have to wait  a year to see  maybe you that  fought last week  why can't we see the fight  like Sarah and Pierre  fought last week  why can't I see that fight  they'll do the reruns  of the pay per view  for the next month  and then after that  that fight will show up  probably on Spike TV  on UFC on News  I've been looking at Spike  and I don't see 
[03:47:00]  well I still see  these guys  it'll be a while  they're still trying to  sell the pay per views  for a month after the show  thank you  $7  what happened with HBO  HBO is in negotiations  to run it  like they ran boxing  which I think  would have helped  both  but did HBO  want to run it  and UFC  didn't want to go  well I think  HBO is still  very entrenched  in boxing  and one of the few  places where boxing  has been successful  in selling pay per views  and a lot of that  I think is because  of Golden Boy  and the matchups  they're doing  and the 24-7 
[03:47:30]  a lot of those things  they're doing  to create an emotional  interest in those fights  and they are interested  in getting into MMA  but they didn't get along  with Dana  you know  there are control issues  there  and so  somebody will end up  doing a deal  with HBO  it will happen  I worry when  Jones made a statement  that he may want to  go into your kind of thing  and I think that would have  been a big mistake  although he's going to  fight for a title  in a couple of months  Tom Jones  oh he won't go  I don't know 
[03:48:00]  I come on the show  this guy takes more naps  Ron Jones you dickhead  we should get Randy out of here  Randy pleasure meeting you man  you too  thanks for having me on  Randy you're a gentleman's gentleman  you're a credit to the sport  and you got a great smile  and let me tell you  when you're behind the scenes  and we hear you over  you know  analyzing the fight  you give us much interest in it 
[03:48:30]  because you know more  you know when they say  you step over a toe  bending the thing  I don't know what the fuck  you're talking about  but I still say it  as you're a classy guy  we all love you  thanks man  hold on  the movie is called  Red Belt  Red Belt  Sony Pictures  and when is it  how do people see this film  we'll be here  in the Tribeca Film Festival  this weekend  so it premieres Friday night  and it's a good movie  I think you'll like it  I think in theaters  May 2nd  is it a limited release  or is it a pretty  national release  I think it's going to be  a national release  oh good man  it's a good movie  Tim Allen's in it

I hit a line track,  I thought for sure  it was a doubling,  I made a great catch,  and 56 in a row.  And when Pete Rose 
[04:00:00]  started to come close,  Joe was going to the arena  putting a fucking hex on him.  He didn't want him  to break that fucking record.  You know,  he was a very selfish  kind of guy,  but what a ball player.  Same with Mickey.  Mickey was always bomb.  I'd go to his fucking restaurant,  he's always,  he's like,  I'm showing another picture.  I said,  what the fuck,  give me an oil painting.  I don't want a fucking picture.  And he'd have it here,  and he'd turn it around  and go,  here,  and it's fucking,  I said,  give it to the kids.  Kids are in awe with you guys.  You know,  I gave the five balls.  Just in case you're wondering,  Pat Cooper hasn't stopped talking 
[04:00:30]  since we went to break.  The great Pat Cooper.  Oh, fuck you now.  You want me to go home?  The great Pat Cooper.  I ain't coming in.  I'm going to come next year.  The last time we saw Pat Cooper  was at his fine roast.  The boys did a good job  with you, Pat.  Huh?  Yeah,  you might want to put  those headphones on.  I'm deaf anyway.  Yeah,  I know,  but we amplify the audio  through the headphones,  and you're good.  No,  the roast,  we were there.  I know you were there.  I appreciate it.  I love you for it,  and I thank you.  I'm still shocked  that I got a roast.  The boys did great. 
[04:01:00]  I got news for you.  Yeah.  Now I'm going to be  the Grand Marshal  of the Boxing Hall of Fame  in Canistota,  June 7th.  Nice.  That to me is a big  fucking thrill.  Of course.  I'm going to be  the Grand Marshal,  get to meet all these  boxers that I...  They're not going to  remember me and you, though.  Who's going to be there?  June 7th.  All of them.  Everyone,  Common Bacillio,  every fucking fight  that's alive,  fights from all over the world  to go there.  Two-day weekend.  I would love to get there.  Canistota,  June 6th and 7th.  No, I'm sorry.  June 7th and 8th. 
[04:01:30]  Ooh.  It's great.  I mean,  every fucking great fighter  that's alive will be there  because it's a great...  A big prestige...  Ali won't be there, will he?  Well, Ali, you know,  like the poor...  But that's another thing.  I look at this guy,  I want to cry,  and then I see George Foreman  who he knocked on his ass.  Yeah.  Walking around making  90 million fucking dollars a minute.  With his stupid  burger cooker thing.  Yeah, he's a millionaire.  I mean,  Ali made boxing  when it was shit,  you know,  really going down.  I mean,  this guy had a pair of balls  and to beat Foreman, 
[04:02:00]  smart,  and to get thinner,  he's Parkinson's disease,  he's punch drunk.  Foreman was an animal.  Who do you think  was the greatest fighter  of all time?  Ray Robinson.  Wow, that was quick.  Why?  Oh, man,  I saw him.  I was a kid.  That guy was fucking  with both hands.  I mean,  did you see  the great fight I saw  when he was on his way out?  He fought Gene Fulmer  and a six-inch left hook  knocked Fulmer fucking flat.  And Fulmer said,  why is he dancing up and down?  The guy said,  he just knocked you out,  you fucking asshole.  That's a fact. 
[04:02:30]  Ray Robinson  with a shot,  I think,  six fucking inches,  hit him on left hook.  I mean,  nobody knocks Gene Fulmer out.  This guy was ahead of a granite.  Six fucking inches.  Flat.  Wow.  What a great fighter.  Willie Pep,  another one.  The only guy to win a round  without landing a blow.  How did that happen?  Very simple.  He ran.  The fuck you want?  Here's a guy  showing artistic  in the ring.  But how do you win the round  if you don't throw a punch?  Because the guy  couldn't touch him.  So the guy  throwing the punches  were missing. 
[04:03:00]  Don't question me.  It's in the records.  One round  without throwing a punch.  It just fucked.  Bobbing and weaving.  So because he was  bobbing and weaving  and the other guy  was swinging and missing  and he loses the round.  How about LaVar?  LaMotta?  Did you ever see him fight  Jake?  You ever see LaMotta  fight right?  I mean,  he knocked Ray down.  I saw my tape  but LaMotta  was a fucking animal.  See this guy?  He's not going to be  what's his name?  Randy.  I'm like,  fuck LaMotta.  LaMotta would turn around  and take him.  Give a fuck LaMotta 
[04:03:30]  was a fucking maniac  but a fighter.  I mean,  he turned around  and said,  hit me,  hit me.  And Ray finally  stopped him  and he went to Ray  and said,  let me tell you  you asshole,  you couldn't knock me down  four fucking times.  He called five times  that couldn't knock him down.  Never knocked me down, Ray.  Never knocked me down.  I love Raging Bull.  One of my favorite movies  of all time.  Hey, Pat,  you were talking about  Joe DiMaggio.  Oh, we are now.  We've been on for...  What the hell do I know?  I don't know.  You're sure about  eating that slap  that you call that food.  It was yogurt.  Yogurt.  You eat yogurt? 
[04:04:00]  Why not?  You know,  something that'll suck  on a straw.  You're out of your mind.  What's wrong with yogurt?  It's like what comes  out of a cock.  Yeah, Ray,  thank you.  That's bad.  Fucking yogurt.  I don't know  what this guy likes.  He likes macaroni.  He likes macaroni.  All right,  Joe DiMaggio,  what can you say  about him on the air?  Because some of the stories  you were telling off air  were great.  Great ballpark,  but Joe was not  a nice,  nice,  you know,  outgoing.  One time I said,  Joe,  would you sign a bat?  He says,  no,  I don't sign bats. 
[04:04:30]  I said,  would you sign a tree?  And he went,  what does that mean?  I said,  forget about it,  Joe.  Forget about it.  He wouldn't sign a bat  and he knew you?  He wouldn't sign nothing.  Were you good friends  with him?  The only way I got a ball,  I didn't ask,  I would sit down  and we'd be talking,  meets him  and a couple of friends  and he goes,  I guess you want a ball,  Pat.  And I said,  well,  Joe,  I really,  you know,  I didn't know what to say  because I'm not a collector.  So he signs to Pat Cooper,  Joe DiMaggio,  I take the ball.  About a month later,  I meet him again  because I guess you want a ball.  I said,  how many fucking balls  can I take you,  Joe?  I got one ball.  Now I got two balls.  I wound up with five balls  and I gave them away 
[04:05:00]  because I gave them to kids.  And I told the kids,  with your thumb,  get my name off,  rub it.  I said,  shoot.  I says,  and they got the thing.  I don't collect.  I work with the biggest stars  in the world.  I'm not a collector.  I'm embarrassed.  I say,  Frank,  would you give me  a fucking picture?  Right.  I don't ask.  I don't always forget about it.  That's why nobody takes pictures.  Jimmy,  that's a biggie,  right?  A picture with Frank Sinatra?  Oh, yeah.  I get pictures with everybody.  I love it.  I always ask.  Well, that's good.  I'm not against that.  I don't have the patience  to ask. 
[04:05:30]  I go,  I got to knock it.  I work with Ginger Rogers.  Who comes in opening night?  Cary Grant.  So Ginger Rogers calls his path.  Come in.  I want you to meet Cary Grant.  So I turn around.  I go there.  I'm in awe of this guy.  And he's going,  you know,  you don't like your work.  He's giving me that shit.  You know,  I said,  he says you're very fast  on the uptake.  On the uptake?  What the fuck is happening?  I don't understand.  But that's,  that's,  it is Cary Grant. 
[04:06:00]  He's like,  stop doing Cary Grant.  Yeah.  That's the fucking humor.  Oh,  that's hysterical.  It's called fucking humor.  What's the matter with you?  He's laughing at it.  I'm laughing  because it's hysterical.  Yeah.  How about that?  Only,  only you.  That's my sense of humor.  That's why I never made it bigger.  Is that it?  That's all right.  That's the truth.  This is twisting,  twisting.  By the way,  huh?  Fuck him.  Hey.  Fuck him for not making you bigger,  Pat Cooper.  I respect everybody.  Just don't break my balls.  I ain't looking to be any bigger.  I made a nice piece of change.  I'm happy.  I do what I want to do 
[04:06:30]  and that's it.  Where the fuck am I going?  I've been,  I told him it was over when I was 40.  Then nobody wanted to listen.  It's fucking over.  I said,  what do you do for,  what do you do for a hobby?  I rehearse dying.  That's what I fucking do.  What do you do for a hobby?  At 80 fucking years old,  what do you do for a hobby?  You're 80?  I'll be 80 in a year.  Wow.  Wow.  Guy said to me,  you know,  guy says,  you know,  you look good for 79,  so let me tell you something.  I'd rather be 40 and look old.  How the fuck does that grab you, pal?  I look good at 79. 
[04:07:00]  How about Sinatra?  You worked at Sinatra, right?  I worked at him and very strange.  You know,  he's this guy.  Everybody thought he was Jesus Christ.  A lot of tough guys thought he was,  you know,  that's my man.  I said,  you guys are great entertainers.  You can't walk on fucking water.  I mean,  he's going to die like everybody else.  What are you making?  You know,  but it's like talking to a wall.  People really idolize,  idolize.  I don't idolize anybody.  I respect people,  but to get to a point of being the biggest fan  and of being a collector, 
[04:07:30]  it's not that I don't respect these people.  It means nothing to me to save  because when I die,  you think my kid's going to go,  dad,  you're going to leave me the Sinatra picture?  Are you going to leave me?  I'll leave you a cock.  I'll leave you the fucking money.  You don't want no fucking pictures.  Where's the fucking money?  That's the name of the game.  That's what they're going to save.  We'll take my kids not their age  or my grandkids go,  oh,  how was Perry Como?  They don't give a fuck for Perry Como.  You understand?  Right now,  they're turning around  and they don't know where the fuck they're going.  All they do is they're on the fucking computer,  can't find a bathroom.  What does that tell you? 
[04:08:00]  So what the fuck good is that?  See,  we have common sense.  We're the last of our era.  After we're gone,  this fucking country's going in the toilet.  It's over.  Yeah,  it is over.  I told you.  What happened to my fucking thing?  Did I break it?  No.  All right.  Hey,  one of our favorite things  is when you talk about your father  taking those amazing dumps.  He was like,  he was a real man.  Well,  my father believed.  We love your father's stories  because when you're not here,  Anthony kind of imitates you doing father's stories.  Anthony should do something.  He isn't that a fucking thing I'm on. 
[04:08:30]  I've just been sitting here  admiring and respecting Mr. Cooper.  You know,  Anthony.  That's what I do.  I listen.  And he's Italian like you.  Why are you going after him like that?  I don't go after nobody.  I have a love for people.  Because you know something?  You're never too old to learn something.  And I'm sitting here next to Pat Cooper.  See?  And I respect the man.  God bless you.  And I respect you people, too.  And I think it's very important.  It's very important to have character.  And my old man believed that.  He says,  When they take your dignity away, 
[04:09:00]  he says,  You're better off dead.  He says,  Because you're nobody.  My father says,  When you have a zipper in front of your pants,  act like a man.  Otherwise,  pee in your pants.  And I used to listen to him.  My old man,  my old man talked with his neck.  He kept going,  You know,  I want to tell you, buddy.  I said,  How the fuck you eat soup?  Because I thought I could see it.  I swear,  I never knew him to talk with me  when I was gone.  So where are you going to go?  I said,  Everything all right?  But that style is over. 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  Those are the true people.  He was a man's man.  Oh, man.  My old man was a bricklayer.  He was like a fucking artist.  When you heard,  You know,  that was my old man.  And the fucking sparks came out of the bricks.  He had confidence in his work.  I was the fucking worst.  I closed bedroom windows.  Is that a phone?  Yeah, it's yours.  Oh, Pat's got a call?  No, no.  I don't call.  I don't.  I don't.  I got to shut it off.  What the hell is this?  It's God.  He always bothers me.  I get a lot of unavailable. 
[04:10:00]  I get a lot of people that I want to know  if I want to buy this, buy that.  And I said,  I'll buy my ass.  I'm finished.  When I lost my wife three years ago,  I put all my eggs in my grandkids.  And that's it.  That's the fucking end of it.  That's reality.  That's not bullshit.  You're going to get nothing.  You understand?  You're going to kiss my ass.  I'll leave nothing in the fucking will.  The day my wife died,  a week later,  got a lawyer.  Give him every fucking thing.  He said,  well,  don't you want some of yourself?  Fuck me.  Give it to him now.  Who wants to hit him later?  Give it right there.  Yeah.  That's reality.  You pass it on. 
[04:10:30]  And they're good kids.  They're going to do good.  They want to go to college fine.  They don't want to go to college.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  It's nice to love your children  and nice to love your grandkids.  But they got to understand,  I'm on my last leg.  Don't fucking tell me what to do,  where to go,  and when to do it.  You understand?  I went to the doctor  for a fucking examination.  I'm an A1 shape.  And then he says to me,  you have ED.  And I thought it was cancer.  He says,  you have erectional dysfunction.  I says,  what do you mean?  I said,  he says, 
[04:11:00]  well,  you can't get a hard on.  I said,  well,  I haven't tried.  And this is the truth.  He says,  did you try Viagra?  My own to God.  I tried Viagra  about two weeks after he told me that.  I'm in front of the fucking mirror  waiting for this thing to rise.  So he calls me.  He says,  how are you doing?  He says,  you got to have a girl.  You stupid fuck.  What are you doing  in front of the fucking thing?  And that's how dumb I am.  So he gives me a needle.  My out to God.  It's called PCP or BB.  PCP.  He took a glove  and he puts my pecker in his hand. 
[04:11:30]  My out to God.  And he injects it  with a little,  like he pricks the prick.  And I swear to you,  I go in another room  and I wait 10 minutes  and this thing starts to rise.  My out to God.  He comes in,  puts another glove on.  I take the fazool out.  He looks at it again.  He goes,  wait another minute or two.  I'm wearing jeans.  I should never see  my green kids again.  And I got scared.  It started to push  against my jeans.  Now I can't get  the fucking thing down.  And he comes running  and he puts another  fucking glove on  and he's turning around.  He says,  calm down.  Calm down.  And he puts ice cubes. 
[04:12:00]  I says,  what the fuck are you doing  to my pecker here?  He says,  Pat,  sometimes that happens.  What if I'm all alone  and the fucking heart  don't want to go down?  What am I going to call  my fucking neighbor?  What am I going to do?  He says,  you call 9-11.  9-11.  My cock can't go down.  Are you fucking stupid?  How much for the service?  1,500 fucking hours.  I said,  wait a minute.  I gave the 1,500.  I gave the 1,500.  I said,  okay.  He says,  now here's how you do it.  He gives you a dildo  and it shows you  how to inject 
[04:12:30]  your gaga oxidative.  I said,  okay.  I go home  and I said,  I'll wait a couple of days.  Stupid me,  you need a girl.  I'm not thinking.  I get a fucking needle  and I put it in my fuzz hole.  Okay?  Now it's laying there  and it's laying there.  Nothing.  I call this fucking bum up.  I says,  hey,  my thing ain't.  He said,  Pat,  you need a girl.  I said,  how come when I was in the room  with your fucking thing  there was no girl  and my cock went up.  Are you working on  different medicines,  you crap bastard?  So,  what did I do?  1,500 hours.  My hotel got it.  I threw the shit out. 
[04:13:00]  I threw the shit out.  I said,  what am I fucking pushing  80 years old?  I ain't got a fucking broad.  What am I going to do?  What am I waiting?  But you know,  that's the fucking dumb ego.  I had all my sexual fantasies.  That's yesterday.  There's no more.  Fortnite right now  is a big thing for me.  Passing gas is wonderful.  And if it lasts long,  I cry emotionally.  Because I know  because I know  the fucking belly  is working.  My father says,  when you go every morning  to dump,  it means that the engine  is working.  So when he says, 
[04:13:30]  when you do that,  you are alive.  He's right.  Right.  And he would leave no smells,  I remember,  from your last visit.  No, no, no, no.  You don't.  When you eat the  faletti pomodoro,  it just keeps it clean.  So we're not looking  for smells.  We're not looking  for nothing.  When you go every day,  the engine has,  who the fuck is Jimmy?  What are you calling him?  Tim Norton right here.  Huh?  Well, about,  Jimmy makes sure  we all smell his fart.  But you're looking,  you're looking over there  when you're talking to Jimmy.  I don't know.  Well, you know,  you need a girl,  obviously,  but you're saying 
[04:14:00]  fantasies and stuff.  Maybe you take care  of yourself if you...  No, I can't.  How can I do  a masturbation  if it don't go up?  It's like masturbating  a fucking mushroom.  Give me a fucking break.  You could go back  to the doctor,  maybe pay him  a little more than $1,500.  It is what it is.  It's fucking dead.  You should masturbate.  In front of the computer  with some of that porn.  Let me tell you something.  I say it on the stage,  buddy,  and I tell everybody,  when you can pee,  do the sign of the cross,  you're fucking lucky.  I says,  peeing is an art. 
[04:14:30]  I got friends of mine  who have prostate problems.  They have to pee at an angle.  They wouldn't give a fuck.  Just water comes out.  I said,  so after this show,  we're all going to go and pee.  That's what we're going to do.  There's 800 of you out there.  Let's go fucking pee.  That's better than sex.  That's better than normal.  Rather than a guy  probing your ass  and probing the things  with fingers  and telling you you got a prostate.  Who the fuck  ever knew I had a prostate?  All I knew,  I had two balls  and a thing hanging  above the two balls.  That's all I knew.  All of a sudden,  they got names,  prostate. 
[04:15:00]  I want to pee.  That's my fucking pleasure today.  Have you ever got  a finger up the ass  from the doctor?  No, no, no, no.  I had a guy,  I had a guy,  the doctor,  they called him the finger.  This guy,  he practiced,  he said,  the best way to touch  and to feel for prostate  is with the finger,  not the blood shit.  He says,  I'm from the old school  and that's what he would do.  And now he can't,  he has arthritis  in his fucking right hand.  How the fuck  can he put his finger  on my ass?  I get a thrill.  I can just see that finger  mingling in my ass.  But that's what they did 
[04:15:30]  years ago  and you know something?  They're starting to go back  with the old ways  these doctors were.  I mean,  a fucking guy  come over to the house  years ago  with a black bag,  he said,  what's the matter,  Paddy?  I says,  I got a pain.  He says,  rub it.  And your mother  gave me chicken.  We had no fucking money.  He did that for 40 years.  His name is Perdue.  It's a true story.  Boom, boom.  Oh my God.  How about a massage  from a girl?  I don't want nobody  touching my fucking body.  I was married 42 years. 
[04:16:00]  I love my wife.  I hug her.  She goes,  you want me to work?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Leave the fucking body alone.  It's in good shape.  Are you embarrassed me?  She goes, no.  Am I doing okay?  She says, yeah.  What the fuck?  It ain't broke.  What are you trying  to fix it for?  I don't want no massages.  So one Christmas  she brings in,  you know,  Adele,  a muscle-bound fucking broad  and she says,  this is a merry Christmas.  Your wife wants you  to get a rub down.  I said,  you put your fucking hands  on me.  I'll stab you  with a fucking knife.  She looked like a Nazi  this fucking broad. 
[04:16:30]  She had a tattoo  on a tongue  called E.D. Joe's.  E.D. Joe's.  E.D. Joe's.  So I don't like that.  I am,  listen,  I am what I am.  You like me,  you like me,  I understand.  But that's what it is.  I don't want nobody.  I don't go for that  fucking shit.  I just,  I like to dip the bread  in the macaroni.  Oh, yeah.  I come in my pants  when I eat a fucking  dish of pasta.  I guess the priorities  change a little  over the years.  But in your younger days,  you must have,  you know,  really been,  quote,  the ladies man.  Wait,  wait,  were you ladies man? 
[04:17:00]  Anthony,  Anthony,  I swear to you  and I don't lie to you.  I tried every fantasy  that I wanted  and after you find out  the fantasy is more important  than the actual act.  Yeah.  It really,  you know,  I got two broads.  Hey,  baby,  I got three broads.  I want nine fucking broads.  They're full of shit.  I had two fucking broads  one time.  They go,  Pat,  I couldn't get it up.  I was fucking dead.  Dead.  Dead.  They said,  you all right?  Dead.  Get a fucking doctor.  They left.  As soon as they left,  it went up again.  So what the fuck was it? 
[04:17:30]  Hey,  what's your favorite  restaurant in New York?  What's your favorite  New York restaurant?  Oh,  I got a lot of them.  Don't put me on the spot  like that.  How about one that you  like to eat  or two that you like to eat?  He's going to say Patsy's.  He's got to be a Patsy's guy.  I got a lot of fucking rest.  I was the one last night  the first time  I went to a place  called Bella Blue  on 17th Street in Lexington.  And they come out  with the fish,  you know.  And the guy says,  Pascal,  hey,  where's the fish?  You look at the fish  before we cook it.  I said,  I don't want that fish.  He goes,  why?  I said,  he's looking at me. 
[04:18:00]  I don't like a fucking fish  looking at me.  And I'm sitting in.  So I said,  close the chef.  Listen to this.  And the chef says,  he's not looking at you.  He's looking at him.  He's looking at him.  But this is what they do.  So you pay for the bullshit.  I was in Italy twice,  okay?  It's bullshit.  The greatest food  on the planet  is in the city of New York.  I'll challenge anybody  to tell me otherwise.  If you can't get it  in New York,  you can't get it nowhere.  You go to Italy there,  they got there.  They don't know  what the certain  flavors that we have here. 
[04:18:30]  We got 200 pasta flavors  for Christ's sake.  You know,  the only thing good about them  is they send us the pasta.  You know,  so they say,  now that's going up  because they say  there's a shortage of flour.  Why?  Very simple.  Now they want to make gas  out of corn,  which means we can drive,  but we're going to starve to death.  So what the fuck?  So what the fuck?  Who is this?  How sick are we?  In today's paper,  they said,  there's a 40% rise of rice.  Who the fuck  eats that shit anyway?  I don't give a fuck  there's 100% raised.  I don't eat that shit.  As long as I don't fuck  with my pasta  and my tomatoes, 
[04:19:00]  because that's the  national flour of Italy,  the fucking tomato.  You take tomatoes away from us,  we fucking close the country down.  I'm telling you that  because you know  what tomatoes have  that thing called testosterone.  Sure.  Testosterone.  Yeah,  that's in the tomato?  No,  that's what's keeping you  fucking alive  because tomato  is absolutely a fruit.  It's not a fucking vegetable.  We know that.  But the Italians,  you know,  something hit us  one fucking day.  We serve.  It's still in the vegetable section  though in the supermarket.  It always is  because we're not  that fucking bread.  You put it in the apple section,  they won't buy it.  They can't come in 
[04:19:30]  and actually put it  in the fruits section.  No,  of course not.  Pat,  there's no way  you're 79  with all this energy.  Well,  when I leave here,  I lay down  and I'll get up  Saturday afternoon.  I don't know what it is.  I really don't.  I'm going to attempt  to have an actual conversation  with Pat Cooper now  instead of like  doing all this himself.  It hurts me.  I may tell you something  that hurts me  because I've tried to talk  very nice,  distinguished  and people say,  Pat,  are you all right?  Yeah,  what's the matter with you?  It's the truth.  You bring up  a really good point though  because when my dad 
[04:20:00]  was getting older,  we were still trying  to get him to  exercise and eat right  and finally we realized  the guy lived his life  and he still wants  to eat his fucking chicken wings.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  When you hit 70,  it's not time  to make changes  in your life.  You know,  my philosophy is  you see these kids  who have bad diseases,  8,  19 years old.  That's my favorite charity.  Those kids may never  have a chance  to be 50 or 60 years old.  So when a guy's 50 or 60, 
[04:20:30]  you want to put him  into training.  Why?  He wants to look good  for his wife  or for some bro  that's fucking stupid.  Do the best.  I don't say come to be  300 pounds,  but Jesus Christ.  I used to be 137.  When I stopped smoking,  I ran up to 190  and I used to eat  those cigarettes,  but I stopped smoking.  You know,  now I turn around  and I'm about 190.  I got a little bit  of a belly.  I love it.  Look in the mirror.  I go,  God bless you.  Good looking mother  jumper.  You're fucking good.  I look in there.  I look at my penis.  It's just hanging there  like this here  and I go,  what a fucking life I had. 
[04:21:00]  See,  that's what it comes down to  and I think younger people  don't understand that  when you get to  like Pat Cooper's age,  you've lived your life  and you don't want  younger family members  or people telling you  you need to eat better,  you need to exercise,  you need to sleep,  go to bed at a decent hour.  You've done it, man.  You just want to  live the remaining years  like doing your thing.  I didn't expect  to get this far.  People says,  my God,  you got,  you know,  with my attitude,  my wife says,  I don't know  how you don't get killed  because I say something.  I said,  they're going to hit me, 
[04:21:30]  I'll fucking own them.  What am I going to do?  What do you want me to hit me for?  If you beat me with your brains,  I respect it.  If you raise your hands to me,  I'm going to fucking own you  because that's that.  I don't go for that shit.  I don't fear  and sometimes you should fear  but I don't fear.  I know my limitations  and if it gets into that,  I back away  and say,  hey,  I'm right  but that's okay.  Let's forget it  and I'll take a powder  because who the fuck  wants to need that guy?  I didn't fight  when I was 31,  32.  I don't fucking mess up fighting,  you know.  But this is what's wrong  with a lot. 
[04:22:00]  You've done a lot of stuff  with like wise guys.  You've done a lot of parties.  All of them.  Did there ever a problem?  Yeah.  No.  I used to know  John Gotti.  Okay.  I know John Gotti.  Seems like he was a great guy.  We had a thing.  Uh-oh.  We had a thing.  He would come into a restaurant  maybe with a couple of things  and I'd get up.  Hey, John,  how many fucking times  I told you  you mentioned my fucking name  one more time.  I'm going to fucking  blow my stack  and go,  please don't stop.  Don't give me that shit.  Gravano goes,  who the fuck are you?  Am I talking to you, Sam? 
[04:22:30]  Am I fucking talking to you?  Bullshit.  I suck it.  And I go,  sit down.  So every time you see me  in the restaurant,  Taramino's,  come on,  and fucking guys  look at me.  I just remember that.  Like, what are you,  a lunatic?  Well, no, you know,  but now people  saw it the real thing.  Oh, they know, yeah.  Well, did you know, Sam?  Well, when they saw you  the second time,  they knew it was a joke  because you wouldn't  have been there  after the first.  No, but I set that up  and every time,  I mean,  every time it happened,  people looked at me  and said, 
[04:23:00]  how can you talk  because I don't give a fuck  who he is,  what he is,  or wherever he is.  You know,  but people have to know  why they finally know.  But that's my sense of humor.  What the fuck  am I going to talk  about these guys?  How about Sammy?  You knew Sammy the Bull,  right?  Gravano.  I just finished telling you.  No, I'm not.  I'm fucking,  this guy can't fucking hear.  But I mean,  you,  I guess you're right.  I just wanted a little bit.  Oh, God.  Here was my question.  He was more dangerous  than John Goddard,  in my opinion.  In my opinion.  But he knew you were kidding, 
[04:23:30]  too.  Well, no,  at the first time,  he looked at me  and then John went,  Sam,  don't fuck with this guy.  And I think,  you know,  then they started to realize,  but then all the wise guys  I knew,  they were,  hey, Pat,  you need anything.  I tell you,  many times I go in a restaurant,  they weren't there,  my check was picked up,  but I wasn't looking for that.  Right.  But, you know,  this is the kind of,  this is an Italian thing.  It's sad that they're  shutting down the boys.  Now, you see this finger here?  Yeah, yeah.  You take this finger away  from the Italian.  We can't do nothing.  This is how we order.  Nicky, give him another one.  Sal, Sal.  Joe.  It was like a fucking computer. 
[04:24:00]  Taro, give him one.  Now, if the bartender gave you  and he didn't get the finger,  they'll smack him in the face.  He goes,  well, you don't want this.  No, no, no.  I told him not him.  You, you, you, you.  Yeah, right.  It's an Italian thing.  But there are levels of Italians.  Levels.  They're the wise guys, Italians.  Then you turn around.  There are people  who just go to work, Italians.  Then there are Italians  who don't want to fucking work.  There are Italians  who don't want to be Italians.  So it's the same shit  with the black people,  with the, with the Polish people.  Except for the working part.  When they took away the...  Oh! 
[04:24:30]  Oh!  It's a joke, for God's sake.  Can't you make jokes?  See, you shouldn't talk  because you get in fucking trouble.  Yeah, I know.  You know, this day and age.  This day and age.  Hey, Pat's going to be at  Count Basie Theater,  Red Bank, New Jersey.  Yeah, Saturday.  And then the week from Saturday  I go to Schenectady.  Anybody that can spell it  gets a job there.  I go there.  I'm working with Dom Herrera.  Oh, nice.  That's great.  I love Dom Herrera.  And this girl,  what's her name?  The Italian girl from Ohio. 
[04:25:00]  Pepinelli.  Lisa Lampanelli?  No.  No, the other one I think of.  I can't think of anywhere.  Oh, I don't know.  All right.  Mario Cantone?  Who?  Mario Cantone?  You know something?  I can never understand him.  I like him,  but I don't know what the fuck  they keep putting him in things  and the more they put him  in things that don't happen  because he's the same kind,  he delivers the same,  there's nothing magic there.  I don't know,  but Tom,  if you're listening,  quit.  Made a lot of our fans  very happy with that line. 
[04:25:30]  April 26th,  which is Saturday,  Count Basie Theater,  Red Bank, New Jersey.  You're sticking around.  I'm just trying to get  some plugs in for you here.  North Fork Theater  out there on Long Island  in Westbury,  May 9th,  Pat Cooper.  And then you're doing  a Pal Talk show  on May 14th at 8 a.m.  Yeah.  You're going to be my guest?  We're trying,  but we do our show  at that time.  Listen, at nighttime?  It says 8 a.m.  I thought that was a...  Listen to me,  you've got a headache.  Do me a fucking favor.  It's nighttime.  I'm just waiting  when I get on.  I'm talking them off.  You can't do it.  Just say you can't do it.  I would love to do  the Pat Cooper  Pal Talk show.  You've got to fucking do it. 
[04:26:00]  Otherwise,  I'll make a phone call.  May 14th at 8 p.m.  And speaking of comedians,  before we take a break  and continue  with the great Pat Cooper,  79,  it's amazing  to be honest with you.  Thank you.  Hector V.  from Georgia writes,  Ope,  you've got to tell Norton  that Jimmy Schubert  was on Ron and Fez  yesterday,  and he used the phrase  put his meat shank  in her prison pocket.  You like Schubert, Jimmy?  We like Schubert.  We really do.  We liked him so much  we had him part  of our comedy tour,  which we would love  to talk to you about.  I think we're doing  a few dates this summer.  Let me ask you a question. 
[04:26:30]  My only problem today  is I don't know  most of the comics  around the younger guys.  It's not that I don't like them.  Jimmy's been around.  He used to be part  of Sam Kinison's posse  back in the day.  Yeah, I understand that,  but I'm just saying  He's got to be mid-40s  at this point.  I went to you.  I knew I know,  but when you first came around,  I said,  because we're doing  what's his name?  Tough crowd, college.  Yeah, so I got to know him.  I know about you,  but a lot of these guys,  they would say to me,  you don't know him.  You know what I'm saying?  Jesus, don't you like him?  I said, I never saw him work  because I don't go nowhere.  Right, right.  I don't go anywhere. 
[04:27:00]  I'm going to go, you know,  but the new breed of comic  is completely different  than what I do.  Than what you were doing, sure.  You know,  but they're wonderful.  But Jimmy Schubert,  we love the guy  and we really do,  but we make fun of the fact  that he comes up with these,  what do you call them?  These euphemisms.  These great euphemisms.  You know, like...  I get what he's saying.  I understand that.  Yeah, but he has...  He does something like that.  Dom Herrera.  Dom does it?  Dom Herrera does about  15 minutes  of these kind of remarks.  You want to get him  to do that,  it's hilarious.  Hilarious is great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen him do that. 
[04:27:30]  But Schubert has a million of them  and we make fun of the fact  that he might do it  a little too much.  I can't remember some of them.  I just remember  that instead of coming,  he would go,  then you're going to put  your meat stick  in a meat pocket  and then you get  potato flakes.  Well, potato flakes.  What the...  I can't remember  anything you would do.  That's funny.  That's very funny.  That's funny.  Spew out your baby batter,  let it dry on the back,  wipe off the potato flakes.  What?  What the fuck?  Pat Tammy?  Pascinelli or Pasc...  Yeah, she's wonderful. 
[04:28:00]  Pascatelli?  Yeah, she's terrific.  Is that the one  you're working with?  Tammy Pascatelli,  Dom Herrera,  and yours truly,  working at the theater  in Schenectady.  That's a solid bill  and it has that whole  Italian theme  going through the whole show.  She's not.  It's going to be Japanese.  What the fuck is that?  She's very sexy, Tammy.  I know her from  Last Comic Standing.  She was good on  Last Comic Standing.  She's not any sexy.  She's a nice lady.  In fact,  her boyfriend called me  about a year ago  and said,  Pat, would you be in my movie?  I said,  I'd love to be.  Haven't heard of him since.  Oh, boy.  Not that I care.  That doesn't matter.  But I'm looking forward 
[04:28:30]  to meeting her again.  She's very funny  and I think this girl  has a shot to make it big  but something seems  to be missing.  I can't put my...  Maybe it's bad managers?  Who knows?  I don't know who our managers are  but maybe that's it.  Sometimes it's a bad manager.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Let Pat,  I don't know,  maybe rest his voice.  We'll all piss.  Hopefully.  Let's all piss.  Yeah, let's go piss.  We'll all piss together.  I don't pitch.  Don't start putting me  into fucking athletics.  You're in athletics.  Give me the fuck alone.  What time is it now?  It's 10.30.  It's over.  You're going home?  Well, how long do you want? 
[04:29:00]  I don't know what the fuck  you want from me.  I don't know if you want.  What time do you get off  this fucking show?  We don't even know.  Sometimes we don't even do the show.  I'm hip.  I'm going to wind up on slides  after this fucking show.  I want to color.  You know, it's funny,  the listener's bitch  because sometimes  we don't show up.  Other times we go a little late.  We can't help it.  We have no bosses around here.  We can't leave right now.  No one's going to tell us no.  That's a bad way  to do your job.  If you do it twice,  you'll see how fast  this fucking person  would be a cement block.  Well, I guess  you'd make a point there. 
[04:29:30]  I think it would probably  be nice to have bosses around  to keep us in line.  I don't know.  Not that we're hoping for that.  Trust me, bud.  Fuck them.  I had enough bosses in my life.  Yeah, exactly.  I like sitting around here  with no boss.  It's nice.  You're right.  You're smart.  Well, you guys got a good record.  You just signed another contract.  I still don't know  what the fuck you do,  but it's amazing.  Don't either.  Don't, don't.  See, this is what I'm looking  now on.  I live in,  I'm looking to stay here  permanently in New York  because I live in Vegas  because I'm looking to stay here.  But you meant on Earth.  I was going to say,  what's your secret? 
[04:30:00]  Stay here permanently.  I'd rather come back here  because this is my head.  He just gave you the look.  Pat just gave me a look.  It was a smile.  Funny, funny boy.  That was a nice try smile.  Yeah, cute kid.  Cute.  Get the fuck out of here.  You got a lot to learn.  You live in Vegas too, Pat?  You live in Vegas there?  Yeah, I got a,  I bought a little contract.  I got rid of all my property,  my land and everything  and my home.  You're going to fucking be around  for another 20 years  and you're giving everything away.  You're going to be a homeless.  No, no, no.  I didn't give it.  I gave it to my grandchildren.  What the fuck am I going to do? 
[04:30:30]  They're going to throw you out.  I bought, I bought,  listen to this,  I bought four, eight acres  on a street called Tamiasso.  I bought it off Wayne Newton's brother  20 years ago  and I let it go out of front.  I never did even think about it  to fucking land.  Now I get an offer  about two years ago  or come Glombin,  come Glombin.  And they're going to buy it.  I said, well,  we start dickening back and forth,  $3, $9, $8, $7,  and then we finally come to the thing.  Boom.  And I says,  God, we signed the fucking paper.  Going to give me a half down 
[04:31:00]  and then the third down and down.  And about a month later,  I get a call.  Mr. Cooper,  this is Charles Levine.  Yes, Charles.  We're finding water  underneath your land.  I said, get a gondola.  What the fuck you want me to do?  He said, excuse me?  I says, get it.  What the fuck you want me to do?  We got a deal.  Can you take $150,000 off?  I said, listen to me.  This is a desert.  You found fucking water?  Yes.  Exactly.  You found water?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  True story. 
[04:31:30]  Now, he turns around  and the corporation,  the people,  the leaders will leave the city.  He's got to get a pump  to get the fucking water out.  Now, the pump,  he can't put it on the street.  He's got to be careful  because the street will fucking sink.  He puts the pump in,  the pump goes into the fucking dirt.  Now, he's about eight feet  in a puddle of fucking water  with the pump.  And he calls me again.  I mean, literally crying.  Mr. Cooper,  I don't know what I'm going to do.  He says,  I got to know the conglomerate  that they pick on  pulling some fucking shit.  I said, listen to me. 
[04:32:00]  I'm not a genius,  but I'm going to fucking bail you out.  I'm out to God.  What's next to you?  He says, the big park.  Put the fucking water in the park.  He says, what?  There's a fucking,  and he says,  they've got these fucking sprinklers.  They're paying through the fucking,  they're paying through their balls  for the water  because water is expensive there.  It's very expensive.  Because what do you mean?  Get the fucking pump working  and pump the fucking water  in the park.  Call up the guy  who owns the park  or the fucking park corporation. 
[04:32:30]  Say, I got free fucking water.  What are they going to say?  No?  He says, jeez,  I never thought of it.  You think I can charge it?  Now you're greedy.  Now you want to fucking charge it?  Get rid of the fucking water.  P.S.  They're still pumping fucking water.  Wow.  And the fucking,  they can't put a house on it  because the house  will end up in a basement.  Wow.  All right.  Good for you.  That went down your favor.  You got the money, right?  No, they had to give me the money.  My lawyer's got one arm  but he's got a fucking brain.  I don't know who wrote this  but somebody wanted to ask, 
[04:33:00]  oh wait, it's up here.  Let them ask it themselves.  Brian in Kansas City.  We got Pat Cooper on the show.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Pat, I love your comedy, man.  You're great.  Thank you.  I want to know,  how do you like Vegas now  compared to what it was like  back in the Sinatra era?  Very simple.  It's a metropolis today.  All they need now is Batman.  That's what it is.  Years ago,  it was a gambling town.  It was a different attitude. 
[04:33:30]  I mean,  you could not pay for food.  I know.  If you did not eat in the lobby  with all those fucking buffets,  they were offended.  And if you were a $3,000 roller,  you got the room for nothing,  they sent you back  with a half a case of fucking booze  when you went,  they paid for everything.  Now they don't pay,  give you a cock.  Now you turn around,  it's points.  You get 35 points,  you win a sandwich.  Fuck your sandwich.  That's what it is.  Now,  if you're a multimillionaire  and you got it in the cage, 
[04:34:00]  what the fuck?  You say,  I'm pissed off.  I didn't get the hat.  What the fuck  do you need the hat for?  You dumb cocksucker.  You're a millionaire.  You want a fucking Sands hat?  You want a fucking hat?  You're a sick fuck.  He goes,  what the fuck is your problem?  You can open a fucking hat factory,  you stupid fuck.  I don't know.  It just pisses me off.  That guy only went for $30,000  and he didn't get the fucking hat.  I'll give you a fucking box of hats,  you sick fuck.  That's what's wrong.  Years ago,  you didn't have to, 
[04:34:30]  they gave you.  The woman came,  they gave her fucking flowers.  They gave her bucks.  It cost not hours in charge.  And the wise guys know gambling.  Don't let all these bullshit  fucking corporations,  they're in gambling.  They're part of the fucking heart of gambling.  That's to the guys that know.  Now they got machines,  all fucking machines  that you got to be careful  you're going to cheat.  You didn't cheat with the wise guys.  You did not cheat.  They put you in the room,  you took your fucking finger off.  And that's it.  And you never called the cops, 
[04:35:00]  you never said nothing.  But today,  with all the mechanism  and everything,  people are still fucking around.  It's bullshit.  It's a big metropolis.  Comics today,  if they want to work there,  unless they're a big giant,  got to buy the room.  They said,  Pat,  you want to buy a room?  I don't want to be your partner.  They said,  well,  you take the doors.  I got eight doors in my fucking house.  I don't need another fucking door.  Why am I going to be a fucking partner?  I don't need it.  You want me?  You pay me.  You don't want me?  No heart feelings.  I'm fucking dead anyway.  It's fucking over.  So you're not going to offend me. 
[04:35:30]  They go,  well,  you're not going to work no more.  Who gives a fuck?  God bless you,  man.  But I'm serious.  I'm not trying to be a wise ass.  I mean,  at 80 fucking years old,  if I could get one hump  before I die,  just one hump,  then I say,  it's good.  I made it.  It's over.  What the fuck is that?  Water.  Hey,  where else can you get free water?  Vegas is out of control.  Yeah,  from your yard.  From your old yard.  It's not the same.  Nothing's the same.  It became,  you become a mechanic 
[04:36:00]  when you walk in there.  You're like a fucking robot.  You got to be careful.  You can't,  now here's a funny thing.  You turn around  and you lose,  say,  30,000.  All right?  Now,  they will not give you  a fucking receipt  that you lost  to 30,000.  I say,  wait a minute.  If I lost 30,000  and I won 15,000,  I got to pay tax on the 15,  but I lost 30,  so I'm on 15.  Give me a receipt.  You get cocked.  That's what you get cocked.  In fucking old days,  they didn't give you  the whole 30,000.  And I say,  do you have to pay?  Get the fuck out. 
[04:36:30]  Here's your money.  Go.  You want to go home?  We'll get you an armed guard.  We'll take you to the plane.  Today,  when you're things,  you're making tons of money,  all of a sudden,  your plane is not going  to leave on time.  I've had friends of mine,  you know,  I had $200,000.  The guy said,  well,  it's going to be  a four-hour wait.  He lost 10 grand.  I've seen that  more than once.  That's the game they play.  Our buddy here,  he likes to gamble  a little bit.  I like to play the horses.  And gets the private  to play every once in a while.  He's up at that level. 
[04:37:00]  He likes the blackjack.  All right.  Listen,  from the beginning,  the best thing  to play is,  what do you call it?  Craps, they say.  No, no.  The other one.  They say craps  is the best odds.  The card game.  What's the card game?  Blackjack.  No, the other one.  Hold them?  Bacharach.  Oh, Bacharach.  That's the best odds  for you.  Really?  Yeah.  Best odds.  They say it's Bacharach.  That's when you see  these multi-millionaires.  Who the hell knows  how to play that dumb game?  You got to make nine  or anything closer to nine.  Then you'll become  the dealer  with the fucking sheriff. 
[04:37:30]  You got to go like,  it's a fucking hookah.  I like to play the horses.  It gets a little too confusing, man.  Blackjack, 21.  There you go.  Easy.  You can't fucking win.  At 21?  You can't win.  You can win that day.  Go home  and never play again.  He's right.  That's the fucking story.  That's how it works.  I've been playing horses  since when the old  Jamaica track was here.  You can't fucking win.  Nicky Rooney said  it's cost me nine million  to get my two dollars back.  That's his fucking thing.  That's his story.  All right?  So what are you trying to say?  They're telling you 
[04:38:00]  you can't win.  They put signs there.  Asshole, you can't win.  Give me another $3,000.  Give me another $6,000.  What else is new?  Wow.  Brilliant.  All right, so you don't like Vegas.  I love Vegas.  So you want to come back  to the East Coast?  I want it because,  listen to me,  I'm a New Yorker.  This is where the action is.  You're a New Yorker.  Well, there's no action here  for me in the sense  that you say.  There's action in Vegas.  You want action.  It's all, you know,  I love New York.  I get a buzz here.  I get on a bus  to come here this morning.  I get on a subway. 
[04:38:30]  I go downtown.  I go shopping  or whatever I fucking do.  I'm home.  I'm fucking home.  I miss my grandkids.  But when I'm home,  they're either doing homework  or doing a picnic  or doing a picnic.  So I go in the garage  and my daughter goes,  the grandkids are coming over.  I press the button.  The garage door goes up.  They press,  Hiya, Grandpa!  And then they leave.  I put the garage door down  and I go to fucking bed.  They're 12 and 13.  They're becoming teenagers.  They're starting to get a,  you know,  they want to know  why something is ringing  in their body.  So, you know,  I tell my daughter  to watch them,  you know,  and tell them the truth,  whatever it's all about. 
[04:39:00]  But they're good kids,  but I'm not,  I'm not a guy  that's going to sit there  and be with them  five, six days a week.  You don't like kids?  I can't.  I love them,  but I don't see them.  I'm there seven fucking days.  But you can't relate to them?  Is that what you're getting at?  You can't relate to them?  I can relate to them.  I tell them,  shut up,  I'm your grandfather.  They call me Papa.  I say, yes,  I'm your Papa,  so bust my first rules.  What's a first rule?  I say,  forget about it.  They don't know.  They're retired.  They don't have a fucking clue.  You know,  but they're different kids. 
[04:39:30]  They have different computers.  They're geniuses on a computer.  Pat,  that's your TV show right there.  You as a grandfather,  like,  trying to relate to your grandkids  into the internet  and all the crazy things.  That's funny.  That would be the show right there.  Right, Jimmy?  That would be funny.  Wait a minute.  Here's what I make him play me  because I'm too fucking old.  Oh, shit.  Are you fucking crazy?  I can't remember sometimes  my own fucking name.  You want me to go there?  I made two movies with De Niro, right?  I made about nine movies in my career.  Nobody's called me since.  Nobody.  You're good in the movies. 
[04:40:00]  But don't matter.  Nobody's called me since.  So what does that mean?  I don't get a fence.  Okay.  Who the fuck figures  we do the two movies with this guy?  And he's a wonderful man.  I said,  that's when you accept that.  Can't go,  Mariano, Captain,  they're not calling me.  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck  they're not calling me?  People say,  don't Robert like you?  I'm not in his life.  We did the movie.  Goodbye, Robert.  It's a fucking pleasure.  Then on the roast,  I don't know if you went  to Jerry Lewis roast.  When I said,  Robert,  he was behind me.  I said,  let me tell you about  Robert De Niro.  He talks with a fucking lisp. 
[04:40:30]  He's been all over me  for 20 fucking minutes.  I said,  I said,  fuck a Martin Scorsese.  He says,  you're fucking crazy.  See,  and I turned down  Martin Scorsese for casino.  And this was my scene.  Hiya,  Ma.  Cut!  I said,  that's my scene,  Martin?  Goodbye.  And I didn't do it.  So my wife says,  you're not going to be called no more.  You turned down Martin.  I didn't turn him down.  I turned the fucking scene down.  She says,  you're never going to make  another movie.  Who gives a shit?  Wind up as I made  two movies with De Niro. 
[04:41:00]  So you can't listen  to what people say.  They don't do this.  Oh,  fuck you.  I am an individual.  I am me.  I can't be him.  I can't be you.  I'm me.  I don't steal material.  I don't want to be nobody else.  You like me.  You like me.  You don't like me.  What the fuck can I tell you?  My family didn't like me.  What the fuck is that saying?  My mother was on the Stein show.  She said to me,  you owe me back rent.  Why the fuck are you  calling me home?  Yeah,  you have to do this  on the show.  Oh,  God.  I remember that years ago.  All right,  we're going to take a break.  We got Pat Cooper.  Pat, 
[04:41:30]  if you want to stay,  we'd love to have you.  You know,  you're your own man.  I got to get out of here  by 11 because I got  a radio show at 1230.  Well,  whose show?  None of your fucking business.  Well,  maybe we can promote it for you.  We all need ratings over here.  I'm doing a radio show  from Schenectady.  Oh,  on the phone?  No,  no,  I'm on my crotch.  I don't fucking think  I'm going to do it.  Wait,  I'm going to go to  fucking Schenectady.  How did you get the show?  What a slaughter.  I don't even know.  I'm looking for a steady  fucking show.  It's going to be called 
[04:42:00]  Aggravation.  I'd love to do a show  in the morning,  say six to nine,  and aggravate the fucking world.  Hey,  that's our bit.  Pat Cooper,  April 26th.  That's how you make money.  You go against it.  Yeah,  let's go.  Let's do it.  If I did radio,  I want to go against Stern.  That's when you're in the fight.  You want to be a champion,  you got to fight Couture.  Otherwise,  you're full of shit.  So when you're in any kind of business,  you got to go for the champ.  Not that you hate him,  you got to go for the champ.  See,  but whatever.  And that's why we're here,  my friend.  April 26th,  Count Basie Theater. 
[04:42:30]  That's Saturday  in Red Bank,  New Jersey with Ray Pat Cooper  with Dom is doing all these dates.  No,  no,  no.  All right,  so.  Goomba to Johnny.  Oh,  Goomba is cool.  He has a funny book.  I don't know if he's cool,  but he's a wonderful man,  and he just got married  about six months ago.  And he knows how to keep his mouth shut.  Who?  Johnny.  Goomba Johnny knows how to keep quiet.  Goomba Johnny.  He doesn't rat.  Goomba is no rat.  He's a stand-up guy.  That's right.  He has a book out,  and he's fucking funny.  But he sits down a lot. 
[04:43:00]  That's the fucking problem.  Jesus,  are you crazy?  Pat Cooper,  so Count Basie Theater Saturday,  Red Bank,  New Jersey,  then May 9th,  out there on Long Island  at the North Fork Theater  in Westbury.  Now,  this is,  oh,  this is way down the road.  You're booking dates for October?  Yeah,  but I got news here.  That's a bit optimistic,  don't you think?  I don't have a date until October.  Wow,  October 11th,  so I got a girl  who wants me to go  to Vermont with her.  See,  because she has a place in Vermont. 
[04:43:30]  You know,  she says,  she said,  Pat,  I've always been turned on to you,  and I said,  well,  you know,  that's nice.  She says,  I have a place in Vermont.  She says,  and she says,  are you afraid of animals?  That's,  we're not like dogs.  She said,  bears,  bears,  but bears.  She said,  well,  we have bears that,  you know,  they suck on the sap  from the fucking trees  because it's Vermont.  I says,  you want me to go?  She says,  well,  you know,  I have a rifle.  He goes,  fuck you.  I ain't going to no fucking Vermont  to watch a fucking bear  suck on some sap.  I'll be a sap if I go  to fucking Vermont.  That's the office I get.  She's 65. 
[04:44:00]  She says,  you know,  I get horny once in a while.  I says,  well,  ring a fucking bell.  What do you want me to do?  Pat Cooper.  And Pat Cooper's doing  his Pal Talk show  May 14th at 8 p.m.  I believe we're doing  the show with you.  No,  you gotta believe you.  I better fucking be there.  Where the fuck do we have?  I don't even know.  I would like you to come too  because you know,  I love you.  Where are we going with this?  Where's this going to be?  Oh,  at the Fryer's Club?  And if you play your cards right,  I'll take you to a great restaurant.  You'll be my guest.  Oh,  what is it?  Rio's?  Listen to me. 
[04:44:30]  Anybody can go to fuck a Rio's.  Rio's is a tough one.  Have you ever been to Rio's?  Rio's actually,  no.  All right.  What do you think  is special about Rio's?  Just because it's like a mob joint.  No,  it's not.  I'm obsessed with mob stuff.  No more.  I will tell you,  years ago,  I went there  when nobody got there.  When the husband and wife,  wonderful people,  I mean,  cooked family,  your family.  I mean,  and a lot of the wise guys  would sit there  and have their sandwich  and money.  But all of a sudden,  this thing started to,  because what's her name  from the Times?  Went in there one day. 
[04:45:00]  And the woman says,  what do you want?  Because she was very well  dressed from the Times.  She goes,  well,  I heard about,  you have nicer,  what do you want to eat?  So she's looking at these wise guys.  She says,  I'll take the same day.  And I think it was  veal cutlet parmesan.  Yes.  So she ate it.  The next day,  which was,  no,  the two days later,  which was Sunday,  on the fucking food front page,  gave them three stars.  Now,  they were taking numbers  over the fucking phone.  Now,  who calls up?  Mario Cuomo has come down.  Now,  the vice president wants to come down.  Now,  they had to give up 
[04:45:30]  the fucking phone.  They were making $3,000 a week  on the phone.  Now,  they're down to $300 a week  selling the fucking food.  So,  this is a fucking movie.  But can I tell you something?  Frank Pellegrino,  God bless him,  and the lawyer,  I'll think of his name,  and I'm a stretch,  wonderful guy,  turns around,  and they built a monster.  They got one in Vegas now.  Wow.  But the difference  between Vegas and New York,  the people that go to Raios  in Vegas  don't know New York's Raios.  There's a difference  because you can't get  the kind of food  that you get in New York.  And they built a monster there.  Now it becomes a, 
[04:46:00]  you know,  you want a table,  you got to know the Pope.  You got to know the Pope.  I've been there  maybe eight,  nine times.  I don't wait on a line  for nobody.  I don't wait on a line  for nobody.  You want to give me the table,  I take the table,  I invite four or five people.  You sit down and I eat.  The only way I can get a table,  my friends got the table,  I take my table  and bring whoever you want.  But it becomes crazy.  There are 90 restaurants  in this town  just as good,  just as good.  That's not better, right?  But they have charisma.  It's like a little candy store.  And it's just,  I mean,  some of the biggest stars 
[04:46:30]  have gone down there  and been refused.  That's why people  like that place  because that guy says,  you don't have a reservation  here,  you don't get in.  So they should make a movie  about this fucking place.  There you go.  Yes.  When's the Palpatine show?  May 14th?  Yeah,  Friars Club.  You know,  I want to check out that joint.  Who was,  Jeffrey Ross was supposed  to take us for lunch  and that never happened.  And do we have to wear  a dumb sports jacket?  I don't want to wear  the sports jacket.  You see the way you dress,  you're overdressed.  Really?  What,  to go to Rayo's?  No,  Friars Club.  Come on,  yes,  baby suit.  Stop busting my balls. 
[04:47:00]  What the fuck,  are you kidding me?  It's only a fucking hour.  What's so much?  I don't even know  if anybody's listening.  No,  I'm going.  I just don't want  the sports coat.  You don't have no coat.  You have no coat.  You come to where you are.  It's one of those places  all of a sudden  they give you like  a sports coat  that hasn't been  dry cleaned in years.  Smells like moth balls.  You hear what I said?  Come to where you are.  Peculiar.  How about a steam?  Can we steam together?  Oh,  Jesus Christ.  How the fuck  did you get this show?  How the fuck  did you get this show?  I asked that question 
[04:47:30]  myself.  You're going to come down  and make sure you bring him.  But me and Jimmy  and Ant,  we want to just have  like a steam  because we hear all the  guys,  they do a little steam together.  We want to have a steam together?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Jimmy,  would you do a little steam  with Pat Cooper?  That's what I'd love to do.  How many times  I have a steam,  I bring about two dozen clams  in the fucking bag.  I never use their facilities.  I don't get many.  Steam with you guys?  Why?  Because I don't want a steam.  I don't want nothing.  I don't want a steam.  See, Anthony's  embarrassed by what he's sporting.  He knows that the towel's  not going to be able 
[04:48:00]  to cover up his...  It has nothing to do with that.  I don't want a steam  with you guys.  What are we going to do?  Sit around half naked  and talk?  We talk all fucking day here.  Pat.  What are we going to say?  Ant has a big heart.  What do I got to say to you?  He's got a...  It's because I'm Italian.  He's got a big one.  It's like a dinty  more beef stew can.  He's got a big one.  Not in size,  but in texture.  I'm going to piss, man.  Pat might be here.  I mean, he's his own person.  He might be here  when we get back.  If not, it was great, Pat. 
[04:48:30]  God bless you.  Pat Cooper,  the great Pat Cooper.  We'll do line of the day next.  All right, turn up for this shit.

[04:53:00]  funny dude.  You know what?  79, I don't think  really is that old.  I really don't.  But to have energy  like that at 79,  I think is pretty  fucking rare and amazing.  Really?  That's 79.  Just going the whole time.  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  Non-stop that guy.  Unbelievable.  That's been making us laugh  all morning long.  Hopefully, we can get this  up on our website.  It's a cartoon of Batman  reading a note from who? 
[04:53:30]  Dr. Leet.  Dr. Leet, spelled in  Leet-speak.  Okay.  Leet-speak.  L-3-3-T.  Yep, yep.  And what does the note say  that Batman's reading?  It's just a picture,  and I think originally  Batman was upset about  something and crying,  but somebody might have  done a little Photoshop,  and he's reading a note  that says,  Dear Batman,  I came in your mask.  Regards, Dr. Leet.  It looks like jizz.  Jizz fucking...  Coming out of his mouth.  That's a funny one.  That's one of those 
[04:54:00]  You're the Man Now  dog pages.  Yeah.  Bad news,  the number four,  Batman.  Steven S. from Bay Show  writes,  If Anthony went in  for a steam,  the whole sauna  would smell like  roasting kielbasa.  Yeah.  Would you just...  You know what it was?  If it was a chill,  he'd win,  but steam would expand  that fucking...  What do we call it?  A fucking...  Just a crowned gift?  That fucking...  That ridged gift.  I gotta tell you  what happens.  During some of these breaks,  it happens maybe  twice a week. 
[04:54:30]  It's like an eclipse.  Yeah, we all have to  take a leak at the same time,  and Jimmy and I  march to the stalls,  and we talk about  this particular instance,  we talked about  the Pat Cooper appearance.  You go to the urinals.  Urinals, I mean.  I'm sorry.  Urinals.  And Jimmy and I  even will back up  just maybe slightly  too much.  Just...  That's not even...  See, that's what I...  I'm not...  We lean over a little bit  just to kind of  make sure the other guy's  hearing.  Yeah, we got the urinal  in between us,  the buffer.  Yeah.  The buffer too. 
[04:55:00]  Do you?  Yes, we do.  But then...  The one with the hole  in it now?  No, but then Anthony,  we don't even know  half the time he's in there,  but we realize  there's a stall door closed,  and we're like,  oh, that's Anthony  taking a leak.  I like...  Because Anthony  refuses to take a leak  with the boys  at the urinals.  If there's a toilet bowl  available to leak in,  I will leak in that.  And you sit down, right?  No, I don't sit.  Okay.  Because girls sit.  Because Anthony's  growing up, right?  With Anthony's cock  being like the big size...  Anthony didn't realize  his cock...  Can I set this up, 
[04:55:30]  by the way, Jimmy?  Because I know  where you're going.  You know,  we're on the same page.  So because Anthony  is obviously embarrassed  by his massive manhood  and can't be standing  next to the boys  in the urinals,  Jimmy and I will discuss  what we think is going on  in Anthony's mind.  And this is what  was discussed  in the bathroom.  It's just the fact  that the problem  is that he's so embarrassed  by his big cock  because as a kid,  the teachers would always  take him to the principal  thinking he was  an older boy.  Because in the locker room, 
[04:56:00]  he'd be like,  they're all in sixth grade  and they would come  and they'd say,  son, didn't you graduate  two years ago?  He'd say,  no, I'm just the boy  like they are.  But he had the cock  of a man.  This massive cock.  And then we're imagining  what he's doing  in the stall.  I bet you he doesn't  even touch it.  I bet you he doesn't  even look down at it.  I bet you he's scared  of its shadow.  What the fuck  is wrong with you people?  They thought you were  retarded because you  had a dummy dingle.  What?  Retard stories have big dicks  so all the other kids  would call you  dummy dingle. 
[04:56:30]  Yeah, every day  they would line him up  on the short bus line  because they said  with a cock like that  he has to be slow.  The first time  Anthony realized  that he was fucking  blessed between those  fucking little Italian legs  he thought it was a curse  and then a priest  or an older man  maybe a coach  patted his crotch  and said,  no, no, no,  it's a gift.  He patted it  and he went,  really?  And he said,  yes.  Really, mister?  It's a secret gift.  I like how you say  mister.  Mister. 
[04:57:00]  Really, mister?  Mister?  Yeah.  So we just imagine  as we're taking our leaks  I'm glad you fantasized.  He just gets mortified  in that stall.  Yes, I do.  You can feel  how red he's getting  and he doesn't dare  look down at it  because he just doesn't  know how to handle it still.  Now that he's an adult male  he still doesn't know  what to do with it  and he's just like  all this goodness  and not enough time.  I just have that  and say it's all.  Look, see,  you know,  if you're at the urinals  with us 
[04:57:30]  then it would just be  a casual little conversation  about Pat Cooper.  No, it wouldn't.  It's fucking Jimmy  at the urinal  and I don't trust Jimmy.  He's the same guy  that just followed me  into the stall.  I walk in  and he follows in  like three inches  behind me.  He tries to close the door.  He'll walk in  and I turn around  and close the door  and Jimmy's standing there.  Get the fuck out.  One of these days  you'll give in.  They all do.  They all do.  Jimmy got me  at least a year and a half ago  at this point.  Jesus. 
[04:58:00]  Give in.  Like giving in.  The best  and Jimmy hasn't done  in a while  thank God  and I think  if he does it again  we'll probably  officially be kicked  out of this building  is when  Jimmy goes into  the stall next to you  and he kind of  gets your attention  because you're talking  and you kind of  turn your head  to the side  even though there's  nothing to look at  or anything.  You're in separate stalls  and the next thing  you realize  that Jimmy  is pretty much  pissing under the stall.  Yeah, yeah.  He's pissing.  And I think  that's why  you turn your head  because all of a sudden  you kind of 
[04:58:30]  hear something  and you're like  that can't possibly  be pissed.  You just see a stream  going kind of  behind your toilet.  Right hitting my stall.  He's a mess.  God bless you, Jimmy.  Jimmy's off to Chicago.  Yeah.  I guess we'll wrap up  with line of the day.  We had a few other things  but we'll wait for tomorrow  because  there's a guy  ripping off AJ Poopy shits  on Break.com  and he's doing it  very badly actually.  Yeah, well  I actually think 
[04:59:00]  he was doing it  better than AJ Poopy shits.  Do you want to do this  really quick  before we get out of here  and do line of the day?  Well, if there's time  but I think we should  look at Anthony  because well  if there's time  as he looks to see  if we made it to 11.  I'm looking going  to wrap that up  in three minutes.  You got a flight, Jimmy?  Yeah.  That's all right.  You guys do it.  I can just go.  I don't want to  the worst ringer ever.  Yeah?  Oh, wow. 
[04:59:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Huh?  The great Ronnie B.  Yeah?  I feel privileged  to be getting a text  from Ronnie B.  What does Ronnie B say?  The great Ronnie B.  Fuck it, A man.  People have been  coming out of the woodwork  the last couple days  to get serious for a minute  because it really is a  it really was a rough one  for me and my girl  and Ronnie B just wrote  proud of you today.  You're a man's man.  Ronnie B.  Fucking A man.  Anyway,  Rodifo's noon to three.  Absolutely. 
[05:00:00]  Thank you, Ronnie.  Line of the day.  Let's do that  and get out of here.  It's brought to you  by AshleyMadison.com.  If you're looking  for a little something  on the side  and don't want  to get caught,  do yourself a favor  and check out  AshleyMadison.com.  Here is a runner-up  line of the day.  They use it for genocide.  Gets big ratings.  One of the favorite  talk shows is called  That old gag. 
[05:00:30]  We had fun today.  Certainly did.  Jimmy, you got to be,  well, the person that does  that character  has got to do  that character more often.  What character?  About the sorcerers.  My friend liked it.  My friend liked it.  You might know my friend.  Hey, this is Jim's friend  Jack Nicholson  and I really like that.  Wow.  That's good, right?  That is really good.  I kind of liked  your Peter Falk better.  Peter Falk was terrific.  I don't want to run  into the ground.  All right.  Here's another runner-up 
[05:01:00]  line of the day.  This is right out  of a Harry Potter novel.  The Congo  is stupid.  And then sometimes  the two males  will fight for dominance.  And the right to mate  with the female.  But if yours has been stolen,  then you're kind of  out of luck.  You certainly are.  I think.  Nagel out of luck.  Oh, thank you.  Six flags!  More flags!  More fun!  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  I did all right 
[05:01:30]  with the funnel meter.  Yeah.  Still trying to figure out  what to do with the funnel meter,  but we'll get there.  AshleyMadison.com.  Here's another  runner-up line of the day.  That's right.  They're using  their worship tree  to give us tiny genitals.  All right.  We'll get into this next.  They go,  you're Asian!  Ta-da!  Glad the XMers  heard that  because the  regular radio people  did.  It's too offensive.  Wait, they dumped that today?  Of course they did.  Where's the dump sheet?  Because talking about 
[05:02:00]  I mean, I'm not surprised, but  making a stereotype joke  about Asian penises  will obviously be  the end of the world.  It's fucking  pussy society.  But the Six Flags  campaign is okay?  Six flags!  More sex!  More fun!  Nation of fucking  unbelievable.  Where's John Liu?  Pussies.  Take that one on,  John Liu.  Leave us alone.  We're just trying  to entertain.  One more runner-up.  One more runner-up.  Why would Randy  need a bodyguard? 
[05:02:30]  Who the fuck's  going to fight  with this guy?  These guys were...  Pay attention.  What about your partner?  He doesn't even  breathe anymore.  What happened to him?  Oh, he smashed you.  There was a moment there  when they first came in  when the show  first started  that I got  a little  post-it note  from Dan.  He comes in  and I read it  and it says  your brother called  said your  alarm's going off  at your house.  Call him.  So now I'm sitting  here on the show  and then I had to  start texting  to get an answer. 
[05:03:00]  You're thinking  my dream came true.  I finally have  a home invader  and I'm not there  to kill him.  To shoot.  For the love of God.  Everything's alright now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See, I'm glad  you cleared that up  because I  and I believe  Jimmy as well  because we're  doing this bit together.  I believe you were  daydreaming about  your delicious cock.  No, I wasn't  daydreaming about  I don't sit there  and daydream  about my  genitals.  Just kind of  try to think  of like  I daydream  about them  going in places. 
[05:03:30]  Jimmy's ass  mouth.  Well, you're  only human.  Anthony's  big dick  is so fucking  thick  that the head  actually has  two little arms  with hands  that come out  and actually  will open  the asshole  for it.  Like the way  you would  open something.  No, Jimmy,  that would  scare.  I'll let you  get away  with that  horrid joke  because I  believe that  would scare  away women.  Hands, little  hands on a  penis.  That's true.  You think  when Anthony 
[05:04:00]  The horrid joke  part.  Jokes suck  the dick.  Not a big  one like yours  either.  Big one with  arms, Jimmy?  No, but a  little Asian  one.  You think  when Anthony  has sex,  might as well  go down this  road a little  longer.  Oh, boy.  The girl is  not allowed to  look in his  eyes because  he's embarrassed  of how  massive it  is and he's  kind of ashamed.  Here's what  Anthony does.  He puts his  face in her  neck and he  just holds  under the  back and  he just  pumps stupidly.  Stupidly?  He fucking 
[05:04:30]  pumps stupidly.  There's no  finesse.  And this is  the noise  they make.  You can't  tell if she's  being fucked  or shot  with a  cannonball.  You think  he just  shouts out,  I'm ashamed,  mama?  No.  I don't think  he does.  I think all  you hear is  the wet slap  of his  fucking awful  pubes against  whatever victim  he's pulverizing.  That, first  of all, isn't  true at all.  Secondly,  doesn't sound  very complimentary, 
[05:05:00]  Jimmy.  His face right  in a girl's  neck, just  fucking, like  the way an  animal would  fuck.  There's no  talking.  I'll give you  that.  I do kind  of have a  animalistic  You've got to  give a little  personal touch  there.  Yeah.  No, I do.  I'm so glad  we brought up  your big cock  it's been way  too long.  Ah, yeah.  It's, uh...  Yeah, it's great.  It's such a  comfortable  fucking break  for me.  Obviously, you  haven't been to  the Congo.  where the sorcerers 
[05:05:30]  shrink your penis.  Jesus.  Maybe you could  go there for  some...  Ah, God, I  so thought...  Maybe you could  go to the...  Actually, the line  might have been  better if it was...  Maybe you should  go to the Congo  for some medical  treatment.  And get a normal  sized dick or  something.  Yeah, yeah.  I think...  Where are we at  there, Danny?  Ladies would find  me quite average.  Yeah?  I don't, uh...  You know...  Why?  Put the word out  there.  It's massive.  What the fuck?  What?  So they can only  be disappointed  if it isn't? 
[05:06:00]  Dude, that's why  they invented liquor.  Liquor.  They don't...  Fucking roofies  are for it.  That's why you  had to date them  fucking really,  really young.  Oh, my goodness.  Look, man.  I was there the  famous day when I  heard a bunch of  girls saying,  wow, and that's  where this whole  thing started.  Years and years  ago.  It was a perfect  storm.  All I heard was,  wow!  I'm like, great.  Just a perfect  storm right there.  The reason I said  great is because 
[05:06:30]  they were heading  toward me next.  Whew.  By the way, I  would have showed  that day if I had  something going on.  Don't make excuses.  You didn't.  Exactly.  The girls yelled  at you.  You were chased  away by girls  because you didn't  want to show your  wee-wee.  So the girls laughed  and chased you away.  Yeah, but then  they went right  back to you.  And then I do  remember that there  may have been a  session of show-and-tell  with a slob that was  getting married. 
[05:07:00]  Well, yeah, she was  the bachelorette, I  think.  Well, that was the  whole deal.  I was going to show  mine if she showed  hers.  But then the other,  her friend had a  show, too, and her  friend wasn't bad.  Remember they had  one hot friend?  Yeah, that was the  one that had a show.  The rest of them  were pigs, and the  one that was getting  married was probably  the piggiest of all.  And when she lifted  something up that  made her bunt fall?  Her bunt fell out.  Oh, my.  I was just like,  all right, thanks.  And I ran to the  van where her friend  was.  And I go, okay,  your turn.  And she goes, show  me.  Okay. 
[05:07:30]  And then she just  took, and she held  it in the palm of her  hand.  And she just goes,  ooh, this is a nice  one.  And kind of moved  her hand a little up  and down as to  weigh it.  Like, to weigh it  a little.  Like, when you put  something in your  hand and you want  to feel how much it  weighs, you kind of  go, yeah, let me.  That's what she did.  She kind of did that.  Right.  And I'm like, ooh.  You know, it wasn't  even a sexual thing.  It was just kind of,  let me check out how  many doubloons would 
[05:08:00]  tip the scales with  this thing.  Indiana Jones.  Yeah, yeah, Indiana.  Oh, thank you, man.  There you go.  She was like she was  ready to put the sack  of sand to replace  the golden idol head.  How much do you  These are ongoing  stories, obviously.  New for some people.  Guys, I gotta head out.  How much, whatever,  Jimmy.  How much  I know, you gotta  pack.  I'll see you  Monday morning.  All right, Jeannie.  Safe trip. 
[05:08:30]  Jimmy, Pittsburgh next  week.  Yeah, May 2nd.  May 2nd, Pittsburgh.  The great Jim Norton.  He's flying out to  Chicago.  How much do you  regret not skinny  dipping with the  bud chicks?  It was the Kahlua  girls.  Oh, Kahlua girls.  The Kahlua girls.  Actually, that same  joint had bud girls.  That's why I always  gave them shoes.  Bud girls, too, yeah.  Oh, please.  How much do you  regret that you and  I didn't go skinny  dipping with, I don't  even think they were  20.  I was married at the  time.  Opie was in a serious 
[05:09:00]  relationship, so we  just like stopped  short.  This is what sucks  about us.  We're like, I don't  know, we're faithful to  a fault.  We were both in not  good relationships.  No.  We still fucking went  home instead of skinny  dipping with 19 or 20  year olds.  I did get drunk and  started making out with  the girl with the  braces.  Well, yeah, me.  Well, obviously, your  relationship was a little 
[05:09:30]  worse than mine.  Mine was really  teetering at that  point, believe me.  Believe me, it was a  teetering.  But then, yeah, they  were like, oh, let's go  skinny dipping.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't, no, no.  Can't do that.  Oh, we're going to go  home.  Yeah.  I just, I'm a waste of  some prime tail.  Yeah, thanks, Dan.  Ah, fucking broads. 
[05:10:00]  Prime tail.  Yeah, where the fuck  am I?  By the way, Steve, you  do know that we're  probably...  Nagle expression that  was.  We're probably...  Get the heat off me.  Anthony and I are  probably two months out  from our 10-year  anniversary being on  New York radio, so I'm  sure the big 10-year  anniversary show is  coming, right?  Whoa.  Wow.  Yes.  The panic that went  across these face. 
[05:10:30]  10-year anniversary  show.  10, how about  I was just contemplating  my own 10 years.  Here's with you guys,  so of course I had...  That's the reason I  brought it up, because  Steve was beyond a cool  guy yesterday, too,  called, and Steve's  like, man, 10 years of  this bullshit or  whatever, and I'm like,  holy shit, it's been  10 fucking years.  Yeah, it's like a  fucking manslaughter  rap.  We got fired from  Boston 10 years ago  this past April.  We had to take about  two months off, two  and a half, and then  we started up in New  York, and then had to 
[05:11:00]  take a couple years  off in there, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  It's so funny when  people ask us, how  long have you guys  been doing radio  together?  I'm like, well, in  what years?  Yeah, actual years.  Because Ant and I, we  started about 14 years  ago.  Yeah.  But we've only done  11, about 11 years  on a truck, and...  I just, sometimes I  think about all the  great radio we could  have probably done in 
[05:11:30]  those two years off.  Oh, it would have  been fantastic.  All right, we're  babbling.  But could have  been.  AshlandMadison.com,  Ron and Fez, noon to  three.  Here is your line of  the day.  Here comes the line  of the day.  Line of the day.  The police chief is  saying, I'm tempted.  Tempted.  So that means there's a  doubt in his mind. 
[05:12:00]  I would say it was a  joke.  Let me go cut this  chicken's throat first  and see what he says.  Six flags!  More fun.  More fun.  I think more fun after  that, no?  Well, it's six flags.  Same thing.  Yeah.  I think you could just  assume it's more fun when  it's six flags.  All right.  How many more runners 
[05:12:30]  up?  No, that was it.  I figured I would just  allow the listeners to see  what actually happens when  our brains are completely  empty from doing radio.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  This is what you get.  Yeah, like a quarter to  or 20 to 11, we hear  that ding, the low fuel  alert comes on, on our  brains.  And you know, you only  have a certain amount of  miles left. 
[05:13:00]  Now we're just coasting  into the gas station  going, whew!  Yeah.  This wouldn't empty.  Here's a, yeah, a dry  tank as far as a radio  personalities sounds  like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  What?  I have copy? 
[05:13:30]  Fuck a duck.  Seriously?  Shit in a hat.  For who?  What is it for?  Is it, is it an easy  one or a hard one?  Derek.  Because I don't like  hard ones.  Gamefly.  Oh, my God.  Again?  You know, I love to find  people at Gamefly.  Yes.  You get games.  And it's great.  It's a great service.  But I got to tell you,  I read a lot of copy  for Gamefly.  When are you going to  learn from me?  What?  I've been teaching this  for 14 years.  I know.  Fuck it up. 
[05:14:00]  Do shitty production.  They never come to you  again.  And they'll never ask you  to do it.  Oh, 14 years later,  you have to stay late  to do production.  I know.  It's the same gag  as fucking AAF.  What happened?  It's to be there  until 10 at night  sometimes.  These motherfuckers  at AAF  will tell this last story  and it's been told  so the faithful  go to fucking Ethel.  There's nothing  going to happen  after this.  Or Squiz.  Squiz is actually  rocking these days.  At AAF 
[05:14:30]  they paid us shit  and we were like  you know,  I mean,  we hate talking  like this  but the reality is  we were the stars  of the station.  We put it on the map  really.  Making no money,  getting huge ratings  and it wasn't good enough  that we were getting  unbelievable ratings  in Afternoon Drive.  They forced us  to do Saturdays  even though the  morning guy,  the hill man,  you know,  the man show crap  or the man town crap,  he didn't have to do  weekends  because he was  quote the star  of the station 
[05:15:00]  even though  like we were doing  way better than him  and then we had  to do production  after we got off  the air at 7,  7.30 at night  and it was a ton  of production  because they were  one of these radio stations  where all the jocks  have to do production  and they want the voices  on the air  and man,  our stacks  of production  started at the same  level day one.  Here's Anthony's stack  and here's Opie's stack.  Yeah,  we'd have to read,  do reads,  record ourselves  on tape.  And Anthony came up  with one of my  many nicknames. 
[05:15:30]  He started calling me  Slappy.  Slappy.  Because I would slap  this shit together.  I didn't have  a radio voice  so why bother?  I would just make  horrible edits  like the music  would be too loud  as I'm trying  to talk about  the product.  Oh, it was terrible.  Opie was able  to record a 60 minute  commercial in real time.  It was just like,  60 seconds.  It would take 60 seconds  for him to slap  the commercial together.  I remember what  my favorite was  Sir Morgan's Cove.  They bragged 
[05:16:00]  20 years later  that the Rolling Stones  played there once.  Yeah.  Like,  there was some weird  fluke that happened.  Like,  the stars aligned  in such a way  that the Rolling Stones  played there.  The bus broke down  in front of the place  on the way to Boston.  It was like some kind  of Scooby-Doo thing  happened.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Rolling Stones  played Sir Morgan's Cove  once.  And 20 years later,  they're still bragging  that this is the club  the Rolling Stones  played at.  That's great.  So every copy  would have  Rolling Stones music,  even though it was  like the shit band 
[05:16:30]  of the day  playing there.  So I would just  start, like,  start me up  or you can't get  no satisfaction.  The vocals are cranking  and I'm just trying  to talk over  like mix vocals.  Yeah, because  a little secret here,  when you're doing  production,  you're supposed  to pick music,  just the musical  part of a song.  And you talk  over that.  And Opie would  start with maybe  a little bit of music  and then the words  would kick in  and Opie's just  talking louder 
[05:17:00]  over the words  and you can't  understand the phone  number.  I'm trying to compete  with Mick Jagger.  You're fucking  yelling over Mick  for some dumb  rock club  in Worcester,  Massachusetts.  Oh, it's horrible.  Josh S.  from Philly,  thank you.  I do read  everyone's instant  feedback.  So anyway,  to finish the story,  so then next  thing I know,  our production  piles at 7 o'clock  started going  like this.  Ants would get  higher and mine  would get lower.  And then it got  to a point where 
[05:17:30]  I would have to  do what's called  tags.  Yeah.  Which would be  stuff like  Wednesday on  TBS.  Yeah.  That was literal  or Wednesday  8 p.m.  TBS.  And that was it.  And I'm sitting  there running  like 16 tracks  of sound,  overdubbing,  trying to get  like different  sound effects  to make it sound  like a motorcycle  for a motorcycle.  Yeah.  Using commercial.  Using all your  voices. 
[05:18:00]  Voices,  sound effects.  I'm rattling  fucking tambourines  with my foot.  It was like a  fucking production  going on.  And I would be  closed like,  hey, I'm done.  How long are you  going to be?  Because we used  to hang out  a lot back  then.  He's like,  dude, I got  at least another  hour, hour and  a half.  I'm like,  I'll take it  easy.  I'm like,  I'll see you at  that Mexican  joint at Route  9.  I'll see you there  about 9 o'clock.  I'm like,  that's weird.  They only gave  me a couple  tags today.  Wednesday,  8 p.m.  TBS.  It even got to  the point,  wait a minute, 
[05:18:30]  it even got to  the point where  you didn't even  have to talk.  There was one  thing where they  gave him a reel  of tape with  the entire  commercial on it,  and all you  had to do  was play it  and put it  on a carton.  You were  transferring,  you were dubbing  one tape to  another.  They wouldn't  even let you  talk.  And I'm  sitting in there  fucking sliders  with my foot.  I'm trying to  wear sliders  with my feet.  Trying to get  these spots  fucking to  sound good.  But in all  fairness,  I had a few  years under  my belt.  You certainly  paid your dues. 
[05:19:00]  So I kind of  learned some  tricks of the  trades.  I was paying  my dues.  And it did  pay off because  I did win.  an award for  one of my  commercials that  I put together  up there for  a head  fucking shop.  Which homeless  guy has that  award?  Yeah, I know.  Just maybe  as a tease,  you're not the  only award winner  for their  production work  around here.  Really?  Yes, our  very own  Travis.  Travis?  Travis.  Won an award  for his PSA.  What award 
[05:19:30]  have you won?  Maybe for  another day  because I know  it's late.  Like, what?  I thought I  was the only  award winner for  my great  Cheech and Chong  head shop spot.  No, no.  Do she chill  award.  What did you  win?  I won best  PSA from the  New Jersey  Broadcasters  Association ten  years ago.  Ten years ago?  Fans have been  trying to get this  out three years.  What was it?  Please pick up  and pet your  cat with stupid  hair?  It's a drunk 
[05:20:00]  driving PSA.  Oh, it is?  Ten years ago.  Voiced by myself.  That's when the  sex changed  first half.  Hi.  Hey, don't  drive drunk.  How old  were you?  I was 17.  And I read  some famous  poem.  All right,  go ahead,  Travis.  Oh, no,  I'm sorry,  you tell the  story.  Go ahead.  Wow, these  guys hate each  other.  I love it.  God damn,  it's the best.  It's some  poem, I guess 
[05:20:30]  it's famous,  where I go to  prom and I  don't drink.  My mother  tells me not  to drink.  You get in  a car with  somebody that's  drunk and you  die.  No, I'm  driving home  all sober.  And a drunk  driver hits  you.  Damn it, Anthony.  I know it's  something tragic  had to happen.  And so the  poem is I'm  lying on the  ground and I'm  saying this to  my mother.  That sounds  like, oh,  God, I'm only  17 or something  that used to be  published in Ann  Landers every  fucking year.  Yeah, something  like that.  But it's  award winning.  And it's like,  oh, Mom, I 
[05:21:00]  took your advice.  Exactly.  And I, oh,  it's, it's  bad.  I like it from  the other side.  Fuck, I was  out having a  good time,  had a good  buzz, and  this fucking  asshole had to  get in my  way.  I'm drinking  here.  So I have  that for  whenever.  Going for  me, which  is nice.  The key to  that story is  whenever.  Good.  If it doesn't  get played, all  the better.  Another award.  We want more  from your wife.  She knows how 
[05:21:30]  that sounds.  She knows how  to do radio.  Thanks, Ope.  I'm really  boosting my  confidence today.  Good, um.  Are we out?  No.  What?  Nice, uh,  nice story.  Six flags!  Oh, it's  supposed to be,  it says one flag.  Oh, you wrecked a  bit.  No, someone  fucked me.  You just made  Travis into a  radio star.  Six flags!  Oh, you wrecked  a bit!  Six flags!  Oh, it's 
[05:22:00]  six flags!  You conspiracy  motherfucker!  It is not me.  You knew we  were going to  bring you in  here.  We are looking  at the next  radio star.  It says six  flags and it  says one flag  in my display  and when you  hit it.  Six flags!  Thank you,  guys.  What fun!  Fuck!  You're too  kind, see?  Oh, he just  got another award.  Yeah.  You got the  six flags award.  Um, leave?  Sure.  Yeah, but you  want to, um, 
[05:22:30]  you want to take  a dare?  Hmm.  Fun dare.  Fun radio dare.  Maybe, maybe  not.  Um, fun dare.  Fun dare.  This is it.  Okay.  Uh, whatever I  say, you have to  hit that button.  That's all.  And that's how  we'll end.  And you get to  go home.  Okay, here we  go.  Don't push  another button.  Make sure he's  pushing the right  button.  I got it.  Yeah, he doesn't  really have a choice  thanks to Travis.  Yeah, I know.  I think the whole  fucking machine now 
[05:23:00]  just says six flags.  Ready?  Yeah.  Ant's cock.  Six flags!  More flags!  More fun!  Asshole.  Hi, I'm Casey  Kasem.  This letter comes  in from Kathy  in Oklahoma.
