<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in sexually suggestive and violent banter.  This segued into a discussion of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, focusing on the potential dangers of the balloons in windy conditions and the perceived incompetence of the parade organizers.  They also criticized the parade's disruption of city life and generalized about organizational incompetence.  The conversation then shifted to Michael Richards' racist rant, the media's response, and Al Sharpton's commentary, with the hosts offering satirical commentary.  Further topics included a helium shortage affecting the parade, the hosts' dislike of various NYC events, and a listener's call detailing a surprisingly high number of confiscated guns at the West Indian Day Parade.  Upcoming guests, Tracy Morgan and the band Army of Anyone (featuring members of Stone Temple Pilots and Filter), were mentioned, along with a newscaster's fart joke and David Blaine's latest stunt.  The show also promoted a "homeless shopping spree" and the annual eggnog drinking contest.  Crude jokes and sexually explicit references were prevalent throughout.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of a turkey distribution controversy at CBS Radio, where XM Radio employees working on the show were allegedly excluded, leading to accusations of racial bias. The hosts dismissed these claims as a clerical error. Opie offered his leftover turkey to any affected XM employee.  This transitioned into the "Story of the Day," about a Brooklyn man discovering his father's decomposing corpse hidden by his mother for three years.  The hosts engaged in crude speculation. The show included segments featuring a listener recounting a prank involving yelling "Opie and Anthony" behind a news reporter; a discussion of a children's book featuring two male penguins; and a tryout for the eggnog drinking contest, culminating in a contestant vomiting after drinking a gallon of milk. Army of Anyone, Tracy Morgan, and Keith "The Cop" (who brought in a homeless man named "Papa Rock") arrived in the studio. Papa Rock, a guitarist, attempted a performance, but his equipment malfunctioned.  Further discussion of the milk-drinking contest and planned segments followed.

The next segment started with a discussion about the show’s hypothetical extraterrestrial audience and their potential reaction to Kevin Federline’s music. This veered into a discussion about divorce, one host mentioning his recent marriage and his wife’s presence in the studio, and his wedding song choice (the theme from *The Deer Hunter*). This led to a discussion of *Star Wars* and a host's movie prop collection.  Army of Anyone experienced significant sound problems during their performance, dominating a large portion of this segment.  Tracy Morgan joined the broadcast, and the conversation focused on his career, *30 Rock*, stand-up comedy, and the use of racial slurs in *30 Rock*.  The conversation was punctuated by the ongoing technical difficulties with Army of Anyone.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the technical issues, remarks from the hosts and Morgan, and an announcement of the "homeless shopping spree." A post-show "walkover" with further vulgar jokes was mentioned.

A highly vulgar and sexually explicit conversation followed, featuring rapid-fire offensive jokes targeting mothers and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  A caller, Scott, recounted a sexual encounter, leading to a discussion about Michael Jackson, including unsubstantiated claims.  Further sexually explicit conversation and crude jokes continued. Tracy Morgan discussed a previous Opie and Anthony stunt involving killer bees and genitalia and his experiences in the movie business.  A caller, Joe, shared a story about leaving semen on a doorknob, sparking more sexually explicit anecdotes.  The "homeless guitar dude" (Papa Rock) was brought in, leading to a chaotic performance marked by technical difficulties, profanity-laden exchanges, and poor playing. The hosts repeatedly made jokes at his expense.  Papa Rock also recounted his alleged military service.  The segment concluded with further vulgar anecdotes and the promotion of Tracy Morgan's shows.  Discussions also included "Wow" stickers, the presidential turkey pardon, and a Bobby Kennedy movie.


A final segment featured the "Homeless Guitar Dude" (Papa Rock), who was described as intoxicated and having previously used racial slurs and made sexually aggressive comments.  His poor guitar playing was repeatedly interrupted by technical difficulties due to his fumbling with the equipment.  The segment was filled with profanity, racial slurs, and sexually suggestive language.  Requests for Smashing Pumpkins were made, along with mentions of other bands. The hosts gave Papa Rock a new guitar, but he continued to struggle with it, leaving the hosts clearly exhausted. The show concluded with the hosts clearly frustrated by the guest's behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  Virus.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage, and then eventually everything just stops. 
[00:00:30]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  Opie.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying. 
[00:01:00]  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the opium, Anthony.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of AIDS.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Don't, don't, don't.  Hey.  Hey.  Good morning.  Hi, everyone.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  That's the Opie and Anthony show with old Jimmy Norton.  I just don't know what deaf person was in my seat after I left.  Loud headphones.  What?  The only one on radio who's not going deaf. 
[00:02:00]  I have great.  What?  That old gag.  Exactly.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  Lots to talk about today.  The day before Thanksgiving.  Goodie.  Goodie, goodie.  Anthony doesn't like fun.  I enjoy fun.  I just don't like this manufactured fun.  You're supposed to have fun.  We were in the office talking about the stupid Macy's Day parade.  That stupid parade here in New York, which has too many parades and festivals and parties 
[00:02:30]  and things to close down traffic.  Wait a minute.  First of all, they have a parade every weekend in New York City.  This is one of the good ones.  No.  This parade makes sense.  No, this is the one that takes the most lives, it seems.  Well, yeah.  Except for the Puerto Rican Day parade.  Where's my turkey?  But this one, apparently this year there may be a problem with the wind. 
[00:03:00]  Well, yeah.  It's going to rain like crazy in New York tomorrow.  It's going to be very windy.  20 miles per hour winds, right?  Yeah, and rain.  So that makes the parade viewing much more exciting.  No, much safer because they're going to scrap those balloons in a second.  Guaranteed if there's 20 mile an hour winds, they're not floating those balloons.  They had like no wind last year and another poor bunch of rubes from Iowa, some family  standing under a street lamp, got concussions when one of those balloons took too tight a 
[00:03:30]  turn.  Who's running those things?  Aren't they like college kids?  Pretty much.  And they train them like a couple of weeks in advance?  Yeah, you hold this and...  Well, they walk right by my neighborhood up on the Upper West Side.  Wonderful.  It must be so easy to get around on that day.  And you'll look at the people, yeah, holding down these balloons and you're like, where  did they get these people from?  Just pull them out of colleges.  You want to help?  You want to do this?  And then you have one...  Resume stuffer.  You have one goofy guy that kind of orchestrates the whole thing and he's blowing whistles 
[00:04:00]  and like, oh, you guys pull a little harder over there.  Oh.  There's no science to it.  The thing is just...  Quick, get Pikachu's leg up a little more.  You watch these things...  Get Snoopy's nose down.  You watch these things go by and at any given moment, you truly believe that something horrific  is going to happen.  And a couple of times recently it has.  They get them just under the lights just in time.  Yeah, it's New York City.  Some people don't understand what this place is. 
[00:04:30]  It is the pinnacle of the free world.  It is where people come in to work, not on Thanksgiving Day or anything, but it's not  like we tear everything down that people work with and around and the things that are needed  to run a city this size on a daily basis.  And then they float these balloons.  They're bumping into buildings and streetlights and people are standing everywhere just waiting  for hardware to clonk on their heads so we can, as the taxpayers, can pay off $5 billion 
[00:05:00]  lawsuits.  You know what that's all about, by the way?  The average person, including you and I and Jimmy, we just assume the people in charge  know what they're doing.  Again, right.  But the reality is they, we might as well be directing the balloons down the street.  No one knows.  This is something I've said for years and you don't realize it until you get a little  older and been in a few different, really vastly different occupations.  You really think that the higher you get somewhere in an organization or job, that people know 
[00:05:30]  more about it and are more educated and do a better job and think about it more and they're  just a better like class of worker or people.  It's the same as the first job you ever get.  Know that first crap job you get maybe in high school and there's the boss and you and co-workers  and your work environment and whatever job you're doing.  That is exactly the same as guaranteed any other job. 
[00:06:00]  You go to the corporate level of the biggest corporations in this country and they run exactly  like that job did for you.  So everyone's still stupid.  You still feel you're the best one at the job.  And no one knows what they're doing and everything's hanging on by fingernails and death is lurking  around the corner by some horrific accident that someone isn't taking care of.  But you just sit there in the stand and say, don't laugh. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, you think.  Oh, they know what they're doing.  People just know.  Right.  And you do.  You skip through life with your shoelaces untied, getting on airplanes and driving on the road  and going to see a parade thinking they know what they're doing.  They've been trained.  They're professionals.  Ka-chunk.  Here comes a big street light.  Oh, there goes someone from Nebraska and their family.  How awful is that?  You're trying to have fun with your family and the next thing you know that you're at a funeral.  You're repainting a room in the house.  Impressing. 
[00:07:00]  Thanksgiving is ruined forever for generations.  Turkey just reminds you of the wake you have to go to in three hours.  She would have loved this stuffing.  Awful.  It really is just terrible.  People don't know what they're doing.  I hope they don't ground the balloons tomorrow because it'll make it a lot more entertaining  to watch on TV.  I think they make the call in the morning.  Yeah.  Somebody out there with some kind of wind gauge gets out there and checks the wind speed 
[00:07:30]  and goes, all right, it's a go.  But I think with a couple of accidents over the past few years, they're going to be really,  really sensitive as to whether they float these balloons or not.  Especially since they're all fun balloons.  It's not like it's ever like a shark balloon.  It's always, for the rest of his life, I'll have to say, my wife, well, she was killed by a cat  in the hat balloon.  Yeah.  Well, like, you know, it was a big Marmaduke thing that his legs swooped and just killed  her.  Now we can't ever read the comics again.  Jimmy, I loved your joke just now, but couldn't you have just used, like, a more recent reference 
[00:08:00]  than cat in the hat?  Well, no, that was the one that killed her.  Yeah, that was the one that killed her.  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I'm very accurate.  Big stupid hat.  It was too tall, the balloon.  Was it really cat in the hat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, now I look bad.  Now I look stupid.  So now bring it on me.  Marmaduke's not exactly tearing up the airwaves lately either.  No.  An older gentleman.  Yeah, I'm surprised they're still flying the cat in the hat.  Yeah.  They usually publicize if they bring in new balloons for a year.  Like, I remember when they brought in Bart Simpson, it was a big deal. 
[00:08:30]  Well, Dora the Explorer.  First new balloon to be brought in to the parade in over three years, it's Dora the Explorer.  Here she comes around the corner.  Oh, killing a family from Texas.  That's great.  They should have the Kramer hot air balloon.  Oh, jeez.  Look out, black people.  Well, here he comes.  It's Cosmo Kramer, everybody.  You remember him, a lovable neighbor from Seinfeld.  Right.  Here he comes.  And if you listen close, yes, you can hear him spewing racial epithets. 
[00:09:00]  This is wonderful.  Happy Thanksgiving.  For all you Afro-Americans, here's the Cosmo.  Well, talking about it on the news, there seems to be a helium shortage.  Helium shortage.  What is it?  World War II?  What, do we have to ration it?  Should we give them our tinfoil also?  There it is.  Look, there's Grover.  Giant Grover.  I guess there's the staging ground where they practice.  It's by Giant Stadium, apparently.  I saw that Garfield.  There you go. 
[00:09:30]  I don't understand why everyone likes balloons.  They're just dumb.  And Barney.  It is the dumbest thing.  Not if you're eight years old.  Yeah, if you're eight, fine.  But it's not just the eight-year-olds.  It's the adults that are like, oh, look.  And they go with their girlfriends.  Oh, Amber Alerts are more fun.  Big balloon with a sad picture on it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Joe in Hackensack.  Joe.  Go, buddy.  Hey, Joe.  Joe.  Anthony, man.  Every day, you just become an older man, hating one more thing, and just being displeased  with anyone else's happiness in general. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Not even going to argue the point.  I'm becoming crotchety.  Yeah, he was actually in the back office yelling on the screen about freaking balloons.  I'm like, what is wrong with you?  I'm crotchety.  And then I'm thinking, I'm like, does he go every year, and he's frustrated because  he's stuck in traffic for hours?  I'm like, this guy has never seen the parade live.  He stays home every Thanksgiving.  You know what the problem is?  I don't care, because I don't come in.  You're right.  I don't come in.  I'm out on Long Island for Thanksgiving with my family.  But it's just anything that happens in New York annoys me, because it's a workplace. 
[00:10:30]  It's a place of work.  It's like if you were at your place of work, and people just, and you're like, okay, get  your job done, or try to commute home with a parade in front of you.  Most people don't understand, like if you live outside of major cities, leave your job, and  now try to get home in your usual, whatever it is, 20-minute commute. 
[00:11:00]  We're going to put a parade in your way.  You know, you make a really good point.  It's annoying.  Because I live in the city.  People know that.  And you live in the suburbs.  And yeah, this city, Manhattan, is all about just working, making as much money as you can,  retire somewhere, and go back to the suburbs.  But there are people that try to make this like it's a community.  Yeah.  And they try to keep, you know, make it fun with these parades and stuff.  You make a great point.  Very.  Just get rid of all this crap, because we all know what it's all about. 
[00:11:30]  It's about the almighty dollar if you live and work in Manhattan.  That's all it's about.  And early on, it was, you know, the Irish decided to have the St. Paddy's Day parade.  And that was a big thing.  And then the Italians, they have the San Gennaro feast.  And then every single nationality decided that they had to have some kind of celebration.  And you run out of days and weekends.  And it just interferes with conducting business and driving. 
[00:12:00]  A bunch of groups got together, and they were smart enough to get parades.  Yeah.  They were smart enough to get parades and go, look, we want to do a parade for this.  We want to do a parade for that.  And then political correctness took over and go, well, we have to give everyone a parade.  So every weekend in New York City, there's another parade.  Well, I don't mind if it's a parade that's been around like the Irish.  What are you going to do?  That's what I'm saying, though.  Pull away St. Paddy's Day.  They thought of that parade when I think the people were still knifing each other at five points.  And that's not like it was like it is today. 
[00:12:30]  But that's the point I'm making.  God bless them for being smart enough back in the day when we were doing horse and buggy craft to figure out, hey, we want to do a parade.  Have a parade.  You know, they should stop with the parades.  You weren't smart enough to think this up many, many years ago.  So that's it for parades.  It's like here comes the Caribbean Day parade.  You listen to the all news channel here in New York City on a weekend.  Maybe you're coming in for some dumb event.  And they talk about a parade from a country you've never heard of. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  The Oonga Boonga parade.  What?  I don't know, but I don't want to be in town for it.  Just four guys in grass skirts waving spears and all that's probably a harmless parade.  It's just the cabs behind them honking.  Yeah, I don't know.  I would just love to hear during the Caribbean Day parade a car plow through a bunch of steel drums.  What does that sound like?  They don't even have floats on the back of flatbeds. 
[00:13:30]  Like they have rifles on the back and guns.  The old Toyota pickup trucks with a mounted 50.  A bunch of skinnies having a parade.  Also here in New York City because it's holiday time.  Yes, it's holiday time.  You know, you get the nice big huge tree in Rockefeller Center and then you get some ice skating here and then maybe another tree in another part of New York.  That's fine.  Oh, boy.  And that's where it should end.  Here, yep.  You know what I'm going to talk about, right?  Oh, yeah.  The two-ton snowflakes that they have to get above what's called 57th Street in Manhattan here. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And it takes all day with these massive cranes to get these stupid snowflakes in place.  This thing's giant and all I keep thinking every morning when I drive under it is when is that cable going to snap and just a snowflake through someone's windshield ruining another family's Christmas?  Whose idea was that?  He was killed by a what?  The snowflake.  It killed him.  The giant snowflake at 57th and 5th? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it fell through his windshield.  Merry Christmas to you.  Your husband was cut in half by a giant snowflake.  God bless.  God bless.  But do we need the two-ton snowflake above our heads?  No.  And there's many of them, right?  There's a bunch of them.  All the decorations.  They're trying to make it seem like, like you said before, like this is a tiny little village.  Right.  It's a cold, uncaring, crap city.  Right.  That's what it is.  Where the rats are slowly taking over.  It's bricks, steel, and murderers. 
[00:15:00]  That's where we live.  That's what the floats ought to be.  Like one is like a nice white lady from somewhere and the float behind her is like a homeless guy with a brick.  With a brick.  Big stain in the front of his pants.  A subway car and another homeless crazy person pushing another float in front of it.  Let's get some realism here.  Screw the cartoon characters.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  So two guys humping and waving at you in leather.  We want to teach.  Yeah.  We want to get the spirit of the city involved. 
[00:15:30]  Let's go to these balloons.  Let's go to Tommy on Long Island.  Tommy.  Tommy.  No, Tommy from Staten Island.  Yeah, Tommy.  All right, Tommy.  Maybe Anthony would enjoy the parade a little more if everybody goose-stepped and had a big Hitler balloon.  Well, now they were some organized parades.  Not as fun, though.  No.  But they sure could walk and step.  Let's go to Joe.  No balloons.  Yeah, I don't think those balloons would have been as fun.  You know, just a girl in a red dress balloon.  Joe, NYPD.  Too skinny to fit any helium into to even hold their own weight up. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, they don't even have helium.  It's just a guy going, ready.  That's great.  All right, Joe.  I think we're ready for you.  What's up?  Yeah, actually, it's J.R.  What's up, J.R.?  Man.  Travis, you can't hear today?  What's wrong with you?  It doesn't even matter.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're babbling.  Get the potatoes out of your ears.  You've got to give me a couple seconds to beat up one of our guys.  Yes.  All right.  Now, J.R., what's up?  One of our gender-neutral workers with a massive beard. 
[00:16:30]  The West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn.  West Indies.  West Indian, yeah.  Yeah, this year, for that festive parade of music and color, there were 90 guns taken off  the street between noon and 5 p.m.  Tooken.  And I can only imagine, not even enough, how many shootings there were the night before.  It's a really obsessive, great Caribbean culture.  J.R., I've got a question for you.  So, who took in the guns off these people? 
[00:17:00]  What's that?  Who took in the guns off them?  The cops are taking the guns off them.  They were the ones that took them?  They were the ones that took them.  Took them.  I don't like any of the praise.  I think they're all stupid.  The Columbus Day has to go.  They should keep Thanksgiving.  No, no.  That's what we're getting at.  St. Paddy's Day Parade, Columbus Day Parade.  Columbus should stay.  Thanksgiving Day Parade.  And I think that should be it.  Be a murderer.  He was.  How about a Martin Luther King Jr.?  How about a black parade?  What? 
[00:17:30]  Why not?  Why not?  We don't have any.  Isn't there one?  No.  There's an African-American parade?  Is there?  Or Afro-American, as Kramer likes to call them.  Those people.  Jerry, I'm sorry.  He went to the wrong water fountain.  Worst apology in the history of apologies.  Jerry, he's using the whites only fountain, Jerry.  Is he Kramer?  Shut up, you racist.  Well, he made the front page of the New York Post today.  Because now.  We'll do this after the break, Anthony.  Because it's just terrific. 
[00:18:00]  All the Kramer's.  Regging up old stories.  Yeah, they do this with everybody.  Yeah.  When you screw up, it's not bad enough that you screw up.  Then they've got to go back and dig and dig to see how awful of a person you really are.  And you stand-up comics, Jimmy, and I'm lumping you all into one category, are a bunch of publicity-seeking, name-in-the-paper whores.  Because people just came out of the woodwork and just were ratting him out.  Just ratting out what a creep this guy is. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  You think I'm going to get arrested for something for real?  You think Colin and Robert Kelly and Patrice aren't going to come out with a whole bunch of stories of the constant rights my car made around a certain block in New York?  Dude, everyone knew, dude.  B-O-B-B-Y-K-E-L-L-Y.  Spell that right.  Dude, the guy, yeah, we knew he was troubled.  Comics really are desperate whores.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  When we come back, this is really great.  Kramer's raging past.  Raging.  I guess he loves the N-word, and he also loves the C-word. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, good boy.  We'll get into the story next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip him out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  It's Whip him out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA, uncut, and live. 
[00:19:30]  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We have a couple of cool guests today, too.  We've got Tracy Morgan coming in.  What time is he in?  Do we know?  Oh, my God.  I forgot to promote that. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, Tracy Morgan's going to be in at about 8.15, 8.20.  And we've got Army of Anyone in studio at 8 o'clock.  I know who they are.  Who are they?  You've got the guys from STP, and you've got the guy from Filter.  Right.  Guy from Filter.  Forgot his name offhand.  Great guy.  The guy from Filter.  We met him back in the day at the River Raven, Boston.  What the hell is his name?  What's his name's brother there?  From Terminator. 
[00:20:30]  He's T2's brother.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a really cool guy.  All right, anyway, the helium.  Yeah, Patrick.  Richard Patrick.  Oh, Richard Patrick.  Thank you.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  We were talking about the helium shortage for the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Got a quick little news report on that.  News report, you know, not going to lie to you.  Not much there.  Who cares?  Yeah.  But then the newscaster has to make a fart joke.  They're doing fart jokes on the news now.  Got to compete.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  It's just then.  There's a shortage of helium worldwide.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But that's not going to stop the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from rolling down Broadway.  Don't worry, folks.  Macy says its allotment of helium was set aside before the shortage began.  The shortage is partly due to three plants that have been offline.  You want to get a sneak peek of this year's balloons as they're blown up with that highly reserved helium?  Just head down to Central Park West between 77th and 81st Streets today from 3 until 10. 
[00:21:30]  A lot of turkey tomorrow.  Won't be a gas shortage then, will it?  Whoa!  Did I say that out loud?  I'm sorry.  Did I say that out loud?  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Just trying to make it on YouTube.  Everyone is like, everyone has that YouTube in the back of their head.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, put me on YouTube.  Especially these newscasters.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Well, if this fart joke should get me on YouTube.  Did I make it?  I'm going to be a hit with the kids. 
[00:22:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I'm going to be a pop culture icon.  Oh, Icon.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  By the way, isn't there always a worldwide helium shortage?  Like, I believe the United States is the only producer of helium.  How do you produce?  I don't even want to know.  Don't even tell me.  I don't even need that knowledge.  I do believe this country is the only producer of helium.  Well, do we need helium for anything else other than dumb floats?  Dumb balloons and to make you talk funny.  Yeah, why don't they make it?  What happened?  We want to talk funny here in the Ukraine, and we can't. 
[00:22:30]  We have a whole fleet of Zeppelins that we need to fly.  That's why the Hindenburg was full of hydrogen, because we had cut off supplies of helium to Germany,  and they had to fill it with hydrogen.  You know the fun, how that ended?  Well, I'd love to see the Thanksgiving Day balloons full of hydrogen.  Oh, no, get out of the way.  Oh, no.  And here comes Garfield down the street.  It's wonderful.  Moving down the Macy's Day Parade as the children are watching it. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, wait, there's a flame.  I just spark.  Oh, no.  Oh, get out of the way.  Garfield's in flames falling on the children.  I can't see.  Oh, here comes Snoopy, and he's burning, and everybody.  Oh, this is the worst parade I've ever seen.  We need parade music, man.  Oh, my God.  We got any parade music for this?  Oh, big swastika on Garfield's ass.  Pulls into Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Very good.  Yeah.  Hey, what's the latest on Kramer? 
[00:23:30]  Well, yeah, he's front page news again.  Yeah.  Congratulations to little Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  You got a mention in the Daily News today.  A little quote.  Little Jimmy.  Oh, did I?  Yeah.  On-air apology off in a sorry state of affairs.  You know, most people say, and the apology he did on Letterman was just god-awful.  And comedian Jim Norton pointed out on the Opie and Anthony radio show yesterday that every  stand-up has at some point wanted to lash out at someone in the audience.  Good stand-ups control that urge. 
[00:24:00]  Very good stand-ups turn it into jokes that get the audience on their side.  Oh, nice.  Who wrote that?  David Hinckley.  David Hinckley, our favorite writer for either paper.  David Hinckley.  Since that conflict of interest writer was fired from the Post.  Oh, was he no good?  Oh, enough of him.  Good riddance to that guy.  I wonder whatever happened to him.  How come we still have to read his stuff?  Yeah.  No one else does.  He's still writing articles. 
[00:24:30]  Still writing articles.  On us.  Only we get to read them.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Calm down, John.  Might want to get a hobby.  And at 6.02, what I didn't like about the show was this.  But then at 6.04, you turned it around.  But at 6.05, I noticed.  And 30 seconds.  And 30 seconds.  You sounded a bit uninterested.  But at 6.08, the excitement came back in the show.  I like the fact that he can't say, hey, I didn't write the headline.  Right. 
[00:25:00]  And, John, you don't have to include a picture of us with the memo.  Okay.  We're talking, of course, about John Minnelli.  John Minnelli used to write for the New York Post, a radio column.  He did a terrific job, by the way.  He got fired.  And, well, Free FM thought, what the hell?  We need a program director over here.  We'll hire him.  Yeah.  So now he's our boss.  And I just asked him one day, what do you think of the show?  Holy crap.  Wow.  Then at 6.17.  That was amazing.  Get like a booklet. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  A booklet.  Right.  That was really something.  He's insane.  The guy's dedicated.  You got to give him that.  All right.  Back to Kramer.  So what's up with Kramer's?  Well, apparently the comics, like Little Jimmy, Little Jimmy's type, they are publicity whores.  What I was saying, by the way, is everybody wants to yell racist things on stage once in a while.  You want to just hurt somebody.  That made me sound too nice.  Like, well, you know, you always want to lash out, but a good comic turns it around.  Turns it around and keeps it nice. 
[00:26:00]  I was saying, every time, every comic has had the urge to just really chop somebody's head off on stage verbally.  But all right.  Yeah.  Well, some comics came out of the woodwork and decided to talk about his past and what a raving lunatic he's been over the past, over his whole career, I guess.  Yeah.  People that have worked with him on Fridays.  When was Fridays on?  Fridays.  The early 80s?  Early to the 80s, right?  And they dragged people out from back then to talk about how, you know, he was always very sensitive about his craft. 
[00:26:30]  You don't interrupt it.  And he's really crazy about punctuality.  Like, if you're not punctual, if he doesn't get to go on stage when they told him he was going on stage, he's, like, in a bad mood.  And he'll get up there and just rip people apart.  But you know what?  The comedians in general get really mad at that.  The guy going over in front of you.  Oh, yeah.  I guess he's never had Patrice on before him.  You want everyone?  You want everyone to, you know, to do their time and get off stage when they're supposed to. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  That's the mentality of every comedian working.  You ever look at the, as an audience member, if you're at a comedy club, there's a red light that comes on.  Yeah.  You can't really see it through all the lights.  It's not like a red light shines on the comedian.  But from the stage, you can see it in the lighting.  A red light comes on.  And I don't know if, as an audience member, you've ever noticed it.  But I've seen that thing on for a good 15, 20 minutes sometimes after it's come on.  And the comic, still on stage.  And you go, and now it distracts me like, oh, someone is pissed. 
[00:27:30]  Because you just know.  We know how these people work.  You want to strangle the guy.  Yeah.  Here's what happens.  When you're ready to go on stage and the guy is up there just yammering on, either he's killing and he just can't get enough of a good feeling.  Or selfish is bombing and can't just be a man and walk off the silence.  Wants to finish big with something that works and then he can leave with some dignity.  And the same guys do it over and over.  Michael Richards, first of all, sounds like a baby.  It's like, shut up.  We know you're quirky. 
[00:28:00]  You're a genius who's just a little quirky with his craft.  We get it.  But the majority of the time, you do want to strangle the guy as soon as he comes off.  And you avoid eye contact.  I won't talk to people.  Oh, Colin has screamed at people.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Colin Quinn would yell at you for going over like within a couple minutes.  I've seen the red light start flashing, which really is like.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Well, the Post writes, Michael Richards, lovable and goofy as the hipster doofus Kramer on  Seinfeld. 
[00:28:30]  Do we have to mention that in the articles?  Who is he?  It's actually a ticking time bomb of rage who refuses to let anything stop his art, friends  said yesterday.  His art friends?  Yeah.  Some friends.  No kidding.  Some goddamn friends.  Melanie Chartoff, who worked with Richards on the sketch comedy show Fridays in the early  80s.  How excited was she when her phone finally rang?  Twenty-some-odd years later.  Oh, my God.  They want me again.  They want me again.  The paper's on the phone? 
[00:29:00]  Really?  What college?  No, no.  A real newspaper.  Let's see.  Friday's in the early 80s and had an appearance on Seinfeld.  Said he becomes enraged when someone disagrees with his point of view.  Oh.  My sense of what occurred the other night is that someone was stopping his process.  Yes, it was that.  F*** here.  Said Melanie, I never thought of Michael as racist, but don't get in his way when he's  trying to create.  Create.  See, they're spinning it as, like Jim said, this quirky genius. 
[00:29:30]  He's so, like, out there.  We don't quite get it.  Melanie's an ass.  Because then she has to add that he looked angry and lonely.  Yeah, now he gets into some personal stuff.  Yeah, why would you say that?  You need publicity.  You needed to get in the paper that bad that you're going to trash the guy?  Just because no one gives a crap about you twenty-some-odd years later?  Look at this.  This isn't highlighted, but Richards divorced his wife in 90 and Chartoff suspects he recently  broke up with a girlfriend. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, no.  So she's, like, speculating.  Speculating?  She's stalking the guy.  I suspect he recently broke up with a girlfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah, he'd have flipped out no matter who the hecklers were.  And if it was a woman, he'd have gone after her, too.  Right.  Apparently he did that.  One woman who felt Richards' wrath is a comedian.  Comedian?  Jeremy?  Beth Michaels?  Beth Michaels.  I only know two girls named Jeremy. 
[00:30:30]  Old PD joke.  Ha, ha, ha.  Flaming.  Ha, ha, ha.  On MoronLife.com, she wrote that the lanky funny man.  Boy, they can describe him with a billion words.  This isn't a guy that they...  I mean, look at lovable and goofy as the hipster doofus.  We have that.  The lanky funny man once barraged her.  What's that, Jim?  No, no.  With a tirade peppered with the dreaded C word. 
[00:31:00]  Danny!  Watch it.  I said a few weeks ago she hosted a night at an L.A. comedy club and Richards did a racially  charged and unfunny set.  When it was over, she accidentally knocked his tape recorder off the table.  A lot of comics like taping their act and listening back later and crying in their lonely small  apartments at how awful they are.  You will never work in this town again, he said.  I'll make sure that you little C. 
[00:31:30]  She quotes Richards as saying, screaming.  He's going to ruin her career because she knocked his tape recorder over.  Tape recorder off of the table.  Hey, be careful, you dumb C, is acceptable.  Right.  But you'll never work in this, what is it, 1940?  He's Howard Hughes?  Yeah.  I'm going to ruin you, see?  Meh, meh, meh.  So then he started yelling, you're a c***, you're a c***, you're a c***, a dirty little c***.  On and on.  And I started thinking to myself, you know, I only accept those kind of things as a term 
[00:32:00]  of endearment from dad or grandma.  Ah, she made a little joke about it.  That's funny.  Oh, boy, she got a joke in the paper.  That's terrific, Melanie.  Not from some c*** who used his fame to be a c***, she wrote.  What?  Yes, I'm beeping, I'm beeping.  Shut up, shut up.  Wow.  Well, at least the black community is taking this in stride.  Yeah, they are.  You turn the page.  God, I gotta love the C word rant, though. 
[00:32:30]  My God.  The Reverend Al Sharpton called the Letterman venue unacceptable.  Oh, really?  He's saying he should apologize to the people for whom his remarks were directed and most  offended.  In all due respect to Letterman, it seems strange that one would insult African Americans in  a long tirade and then go on a white television show and mostly white studio and viewing audience  to make a statement of apology.  I didn't know Letterman was classified as a white show.  Oh, he is.  It's a white show?  You know, Sharpton is out of his mind. 
[00:33:00]  First of all, was Kramer supposed to go on Montel?  Montel.  I can't even think of a black show.  Tyra.  Tyra.  But here's the deal.  We have racist Kramer!  Panty!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  That's banana phone.  What's that?  Hold on.  Long button, Opie.  Panty party!  Panty party!  We'll get to that eventually.  But this is what Sharpton fails to recognize.  It doesn't matter what show Kramer goes on to apologize, the media is going to pick up 
[00:33:30]  on it and it's going to be everywhere.  It's going to be everywhere.  What does it matter what show he picks?  Dude, he could have picked a public access show in the middle of Alabama and it would  have been picked up by everybody.  So what does it matter?  It's a Tyra.  A party!  And unfortunately, Seinfeld wasn't appearing on a black show.  Maybe if black shows had Jerry on, Michael Richards would have went on that, but he wasn't. 
[00:34:00]  He was not like Letterman.  You can't get a bigger venue than Letterman or Leno.  It's going to give you the biggest audience possible.  As a matter of fact, the ratings for Letterman were the biggest that he's had in a year since  the big Oprah appearance.  When Oprah came on, it was the biggest ratings he's had in a year.  Right.  So you're getting across to a large audience.  What is he supposed to go on?  Some show on BET and apologize in front of a bunch of black people?  Sharpton's just an ass.  It's a dumb point. 
[00:34:30]  Sharpton obviously not running for anything.  Yeah.  So he's back to his race baiting.  Once again, I'll say it.  It doesn't matter what show you go on because the entire world's going to pick up the clip  and play it ad nauseum like we've seen.  How many times have you seen the apologies since we got off the air yesterday?  I know.  I've seen it a thousand times.  Reverend Al's an idiot who, when he's running for office, we must have unity.  We must have unity in the communities.  We must get along, people. 
[00:35:00]  And then when he's not running for office, cracker ass mother cracker should be on a black  show.  Whitey.  Whitey up his.  He flips every time.  You could absolutely tell when he's running for some kind of office.  He becomes the every man.  And then the second he's not, everyone's an ass.  Well, the thing is, he knew that the apology was, I mean, it was bungling, but it seemed  like it was sincere.  He's just an inept jackass. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  But then Sharpton can't complain because the guy did apologize.  So now he's complaining about where he apologized.  Yeah.  It's just dumb.  And he went on a small black show and apologized.  Sharpton would have said, why are they doing a small venue instead of in front of his own  people on David Letterman?  There's no winning with that guy.  No.  He has fancy hair, though.  By the way, more notes coming in from John Minnelli.  6.41 a.m., Opie hits wrong sound effect.  At 6.41 and 10 seconds, Opie hits right sound effect.  Notes coming in as we do our show now.  Wow.  On the fly.  On the fly now. 
[00:36:00]  Getting nuts around here.  By the way, there was a, I forget what I was in.  Oh, no, no sex tape.  Oh, with Britney and K-Fan?  Yep.  K-Fan said no sex tape.  Can't get enough of the K-Fan.  How can you not?  I love him.  I want him in studio.  He's great.  He's a great rapper.  I want K-Fan here.  Hey, was that really K-Fan on the American Music Awards last night?  I don't know if you guys watched it, but...  I did not watch that.  They did a pretty funny bit where they introduced K-Fan for the last time on TV.  Jimmy Kimmel is hilarious.  And Jimmy Kimmel's like, for the last time on TV, here's K-Fan. 
[00:36:30]  And they lower him from the sky.  And it looked like him, unless they got a lookalike.  They lower him into a box.  They get the Teamsters out there.  They nail the box shut.  They load him on a truck, and they throw him off a pier into the water.  I don't think that was K-Fan.  I don't think that was K-Fan.  That is funny, though, man.  I got to see the video game.  The video game, because it looked like it was K-Fan.  You know something?  Wouldn't put it past him.  Why not?  He doesn't want to ruin his image?  Yeah, right?  He's promoting a CD or something. 
[00:37:00]  If he's promoting something, but why would he allow himself just to be embarrassed?  Nobody wants to be called out for the absolute leeching zilch that they are.  Hi, I'm a nobody.  Put me in a box.  No promotion.  What was weird, though, then they introduced Britney Spears right after that.  She comes on stage, and she did not look happy about that whatsoever.  No, huh?  Like, no one told her that was going to happen before she came out.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  Maybe, and this is a possibility, they actually did that.  Yeah.  Put him in a box and pushed it off a pier.  Didn't tell him.  Kimmy Kimmel was very funny. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  He killed.  He was the reason to watch.  The performances were great last night, but just another boring awards show.  Nothing happens.  Oh, this is...  So predictable now.  How dumb I am.  I'm thinking it was on his show.  No wonder she had to come out.  Okay, because it was on the awards.  Yeah, yeah.  He hosted the awards last night.  Was our boy there, John Mayer?  John Mayer.  Wow, yeah.  His performance was amazing.  What are you saying?  Waiting on the world to change?  Waiting on the world to change.  Yeah, absolutely.  Before we go to break, Mike Woods.  Can't get enough of Mike Woods. 
[00:38:00]  For the rest of America, you're missing out.  Then you don't have the likes of Mike Woods in your city.  Can they please just make this guy national?  Make him the national weather guy, because he's brilliant.  Yeah.  They like doing...  You know how they like doing the anchor weatherman repartee?  It doesn't matter what city you're in.  It happens.  The local morning news, the anchor, whether it's a guy or a girl, or both, will have a  little banter with the weatherman, because you can't just go into the weather. 
[00:38:30]  You have to talk about the last story you did, and the weatherman can't just be in front  of the weather map anymore doing that.  He's got to kind of be out or near them or buy something they can talk about.  But the problem is they want to hire personalities, but they hired newsreaders.  Yeah.  They got newsreaders, and they want them to think out of the box, which is impossible.  Most of these people have no improv skills whatsoever, ever.  But Mike, Mike Woods, is completely devoid of the ability to improv at all. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, not an iota of the ability to improv.  Yeah.  And they try and try on a daily basis, and he just trips over his own conch.  He's sweating.  He's nervous whenever they ask him anything.  He can do the weather.  I mean, he can sit there and go, hey, it's 31 degrees, and Hawthorne, and 38, and Kearney,  and blah, blah, blah, whatever.  You can point at a map and look at cities and temperatures.  Great.  Let's go to the five-day.  You know, things like that.  Whenever they ask him anything, he just says, hi, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:39:30]  He starts sweating, and he cannot improv.  No.  So he's doing his weather from David Blaine's latest me, me, me, me, me stunt.  Of course.  David Blaine doing the me, me, me, me, me stunt.  He has to do one every year now.  And I'm not even kidding you guys.  In the office, they showed David Blaine.  He's in what, that gyro thing that you've seen at every kid's party?  It's a gyro, it's not even a gyroscope.  It's just a gyro thing. 
[00:40:00]  You stand in it, you put your feet in it, and you hold on to some hand things, and it spins around on three axes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every eight-year-old girl has done it.  Yeah.  So that's his latest stunt.  And I'm watching him on TV this morning, because the stunt, the me, me, me stunt has begun,  because it's all about just getting publicity for him in the end.  Yeah.  And I'm like, well, when are they going to start spinning the thing?  And Anthony actually had to tell me, it is spinning. 
[00:40:30]  It is.  He was barely, like, moving.  I thought this thing was going to be rocking and rolling for two straight days.  I thought it was motorized.  I thought it was a motorized thing where, you know, it would spin.  Right.  Just spin them around for days.  How slow is it spinning for the people that maybe haven't seen the video yet?  If it was put in a position where it was just hanging like a ring, hanging, after about ten minutes, it would have been upside down. 
[00:41:00]  That's how slowly it was barely moving.  It would have taken ten minutes to spin 180 degrees.  Wow.  I thought it was hack, even if it was just spinning constantly for two straight days.  But now it seems like it's barely, barely moving.  Is he up for good now, or he started already?  Up for good.  You've got to see how much of a joke this latest me, me, me stunt is.  You guys want to go down there with a rifle?  Well, here's what I think happened with this one. 
[00:41:30]  This is a big promotion for Target.  Yeah.  And apparently if he succeeds in this stunt for two days, he takes a hundred children on a shopping spree to a Target.  So it was probably arranged pretty quickly for the holidays, and it's something that doesn't take a lot of training on his part.  You know, he was always talking about how he has to train and fast or get his body mass up because he's going to be fasting for a couple of days.  I think this was something that was put together real quick.  All right, stand in a ring for a couple of days so we can promote Target. 
[00:42:00]  We'll throw you a bunch of money.  Some kids will get some toys, and everyone's happy.  How about Target just gives the kids the toys instead of making them rely on a man with juicy lips spinning from a crane?  How about Target just, instead of whoring themselves, says we'd like to help some kids and gives them a little, you know, a little promotion.  Poor little fellas looking, going, please don't give up, Mr. Man.  I have no toys.  And a message to New York City.  Can we please ban David Blaine?  He's a hack. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, this is a pretty hacky one.  So anyway, Mike Woods is doing his weather, his weather stand-up from the David Blaine.  From right in front of David Blaine.  And the weather newscaster chick.  Yeah.  Goes, can I ask you a question?  And you hear him going, why?  Why, why?  He loses it right there.  And Mike, you're hanging out with your good buddy, David Blaine.  I know that you made friends with him when he was in the fishbowl over at Lincoln Center.  Yeah, the big bubble.  You were in the big bubble thing.  And now he's behind you. 
[00:43:00]  I see him above you there.  What's he doing and why?  He is actually out there hanging in that gyroscope.  He got in there yesterday morning.  And he's suspended about 40 feet above ground.  And he's going to hang up there and eventually try to escape from that gyroscope.  He's shackled in there.  Okay, but can I ask you a question?  Why?  Why am I going to ask you?  Why?  Why?  Poor Mike.  Poor effing Mike.  Look, man, this show is pretty popular.  It's getting back to him. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, it's absolutely getting back to him.  Can I ask you a question?  Why?  Why?  No.  Because they're going to play this on their show.  No, please don't.  Can I answer no?  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I hope it's a weather question.  I hope it's a weather question.  Will, I need my galoshes.  Please make it.  Will, I need my galoshes.  Please be a question about the barometer.  You guys became friends when he had a fishbowl.  No, no, no.  He was over the glass coffee table and I was laying under it.  Danny Kay.  Danny Kay.  Okay, but can I ask you a question?  Why?  Did, why do, why am I going to ask you a question? 
[00:44:00]  Because they pay me to.  No.  Why is he up there?  Oh, that.  Oh, I thought you were asking me why I'm asking you questions.  How?  Like, Mikey, they want me to ask you questions.  Don't, we're friends.  Come on.  Nice.  Now I've lost track of everything.  But no, what I'm wondering is, did he put himself in that thing?  Um, you know what?  I'm going to have to ask on that one.  I'm thinking not.  I'm thinking not.  Don't you think that if he made the thing?  If he put himself in there, then it's too easy to get out.  That's what I'm thinking.  So I'm thinking probably not. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  All right.  But it's all for a good cause and I'll tell you about that in a little bit.  If I'll just be quiet.  Why not tell us now, Mike?  That's all right.  That's all right.  Oh.  Why not tell us now?  Why tell us in a bit?  Guy's uncomfortable in his own skin.  How great would it be if lightning killed David Blaine because of Mike's in-depth report?  Oh.  Yeah.  Nice strike.  Oh, I didn't see that coming.  I'd like to wrap his crotch in tinfoil.  At one point he said, uh, this morning he said something like, uh, and yeah, the poor  guy's up there and he's not going to be, he's got to sleep up there and eat up there, 
[00:45:00]  but it's all right.  Like he, he started, he started arguing with himself.  Are you just looking at Danny's head completely distracted now?  One of our guys, Danny, um, is, uh, did something stupid as usual.  And, uh, as a punishment yesterday on the XM show, we cut his hair, uh, and it looks  like a red cross cross from the aerial view.  Yeah.  It went from ear to ear and, uh, he has bushy carmine from Laverne and Shirley hair.  His hair really is an abomination.  The big ragu hair.  Oh, he's awful. 
[00:45:30]  He's just awful.  And, uh, yeah, Sam took a set of clippers because, uh, Danny screwed up and clipped,  uh, you know, military style clippers from ear to ear over the top of his head, where  it looks like he's got a little trough in there for headphones to fit in.  And that wasn't good enough.  So we decided to make a little intersection and it went from front, uh, his hairline right  to the back.  He looks really awful.  Have you walked around like that yet outside?  A little bit. 
[00:46:00]  A little bit.  No one cares though.  No one cares.  I know.  That's what it is about New York.  Like you said on the XM show yesterday, it looks like he had brain surgery.  Yeah, it does.  That's probably what people think.  They look for stitches or staples or something.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say, uh, hi to JP in Jersey.  JP, what's up?  JP.  Yo, what's up, Obi?  Hey.  Listen, you hit that wrong clip before for banana phone.  Yeah.  You play what?  I mean, a second and a half tops.  Yeah.  Uh, stuck in my head all day.  Really?  That'll do it.  I just got to work. 
[00:46:30]  I probably sang it about five times already.  Well, that's their theme song, Jerry.  Well, it's going to be stuck in your head, uh, for many, many days.  Here's the banana phone song as we go to break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Boop-a-doop-a-doop.  Boop-a-doop-a-doop.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  I've got this feeling, so appealing, for us to get together and sing. 
[00:47:00]  Sing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping.  Banana phone.  It's no baloney.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular, bananular phone. 
[00:47:30]  Jingle bell, jingle bell.  Jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along. 
[00:48:00]  Golden buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony.  Bring in the puke bucket. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  The puke bucket has arrived.  I see.  The vomitorium is open.  Nine days and counting, Anthony.  Nine days and counting from the eggnog drinking contest.  It's a terrific show every year.  We got a guy that's going to try out.  Yeah, he's going to try to drink a gallon of milk in about an hour. 
[00:49:00]  Good luck.  We'll get some puke sounds out of the guy today.  Love that gurgle.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Checking out a little TV during the break.  And the president has pardoned the turkey.  Ah, the turkey.  Every year you get to see the president pardon one turkey.  He's out there in the Rose Garden or the White House lawn.  Where does he do it?  And he has the turkey there next to him on a big table. 
[00:49:30]  Interacts a little with the turkey, does he?  Yeah.  And then gives him an official pardon.  Well, yeah.  It's just very jovial.  The press is there.  And they're, oh, look.  And they're taking their pictures.  And the president is petting the little turkey head and doing a little, you know, to the turkey.  You know, there ought to be a law that any cute presidential bits are called off when we're at war.  Yeah, we said it last year. 
[00:50:00]  Instead of pardoning a turkey every year, how about you pardon one of our soldiers?  You pick a name out of a hat.  Pick a name out of a hat.  A soldier's name.  And he gets to go home.  Yeah, I know you were supposed to go home in 2008.  But guess what?  You go home.  You get pardoned.  Hey, hey, you get pardoned.  Turkey, put them on the table.  We're eating them.  You really make a good point.  They're over there in Iraq seeing this coverage because it's on CNN and they've got to be just living.  That, the Easter egg hunt.  Are you kidding me?  The Easter egg hunt on the White House lawn.  Like, things like that.  Just stop it.  There's a war on. 
[00:50:30]  Worry about that every day.  If the turkey snipped at him instead of partying, he just pulled a knife and cut his throat in front of the press.  I'd do that on the range.  We just cut his throat.  But he didn't kill it.  It just was like...  I was saying to Anthony during the break, what would make this whole pardoning of the turkey a lot of fun for everybody?  Have a split screen.  So you show on the right side of the split screen the president petting the little turkey's head and pardoning it.  And the kids are all around.  Everyone's all happy. 
[00:51:00]  The pomp and circumstance of the turkey pardon.  Sure, music playing and the photogs getting their pictures.  And then on the left side of the split screen, you show the slaughterhouse.  It's the turkey holocaust that goes on every year where they're just ripping heads off with machines.  Right.  Big robotic with that Warner Brothers cartoon music playing.  Yeah.  Like that old Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Just hanging them up by their skinny turkey necks. 
[00:51:30]  As they bleed out.  As they bleed out.  And the president's there.  Just have a pardon this one.  Right.  I'm going to pardon this turkey.  We just stink in America.  We really do.  I pardon you.  Where's our priority?  He shoots the turkey as it runs down the lawn.  I pardon you.  Now clean my tub.  And why couldn't we just change tradition?  Why couldn't we have a lottery where he picks one name out of the hat and that guy gets to go home from Iraq? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  How cool would that be?  Wouldn't that be great for a family around the holidays?  It's like, ah, there you go.  Your boy or your daughter.  They're at home for the holidays.  All right.  And for good.  CBS gave us turkeys yesterday and I brought one home.  If I get out, my girlfriend will know how to cook it.  And I talked to her yesterday and she does not know how to cook meat.  No.  I have a frozen stupid turkey.  Is she a veggie?  No.  No, she's not a veggie.  She just doesn't know how to cook?  She cooks really well.  She just can't cook turkey. 
[00:52:30]  She's like, that's a guy's thing to cook a turkey.  Give it to your pal that bakes the cakes.  Who?  That woman that bakes cakes that are awful.  Oh, Andrea.  She brings us cakes on the XM and she's the worst cook in the country.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I should hand her a turkey.  Watch her.  Say, cook this and just make a disaster out of it.  She'll probably burn it on the inside.  It'll be pink on the outside.  Like, she'll bring it to a tanning bed.  That's impossible to do.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I go over relatives.  Yeah.  Who the hell can sit there and cook a turkey realistically? 
[00:53:00]  No.  Do you even know where to start?  You got two hours it takes at least, right?  No, no.  It could be more than that.  I would know.  I don't have one.  What happened?  Yeah, someone over at XM didn't get a turkey either.  One of our guys was not happy.  Oh, God.  There is a great turkey controversy going on in the building.  Dude, I had to deal with emails all afternoon long about this turkey controversy.  And I want to write back.  Do you realize we're taking on the whole freaking country with our radio show, attempting to make  this huge comeback?  We have to work our asses off.  And I'm answering emails about how people might have been slighted with the free turkeys. 
[00:53:30]  The turkeys.  Are you kidding me?  When we left the show yesterday, the hallway was lined.  One wall was lined with boxes of turkeys.  Frozen turkeys.  Frozen turkeys.  And I was asked, Anthony, do you want a turkey?  Because I guess I was on the employee list.  And I said, no.  I turned down my turkey because I go to a relative's house.  It would just rot.  Yeah.  So give my turkey away, I said. 
[00:54:00]  And that's all I knew about the turkey.  That's all I wanted to know about the goddamn turkey.  Enough about the turkey.  Right.  You must have hated that turkey.  But then guys over at XM are bringing race into it and stuff.  I'm like, race?  Who brought race into it?  I'm like, will you guys use your brains?  I told Anthony today in the office before the show, we work with cavemen that can't figure  crap out.  I go, they don't even know you're alive.  Because here's the deal.  We made this special deal with our careers.  We work for CBS Radio and we work for XM Radio. 
[00:54:30]  Yes, we have whored ourselves out.  Okay.  So we work for two different companies.  Here at CBS, there was some secretary in the back room that took the CBS employee list  and went, turkey for Anthony Cumia?  Check.  Probably not even a name.  It's probably an employee number.  Right.  It has nothing to do with names or persons.  It's not like, I really want him to have a turkey for the holiday.  They went down an employee list.  The CBS employee.  See, the weird part, this is where it gets a little whatever.  Dicey.  Dicey, I guess. 
[00:55:00]  We have people that work for the Opie and Anthony show that do not work for CBS.  And all CBS knows is they want to give turkeys to their employees this year.  They don't know the XM guy.  They don't know the XM guy.  So there's a list and it's like.  From a hole in the wall.  So they're reading off the list and checking as they got the turkey for each employee of  CBS.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with XM.  And they don't know they exist, unfortunately.  Right.  But then all of a sudden we get over there and we've been slighted.  Slighted?  And apparently race did get dragged in place. 
[00:55:30]  Well, how did race?  Who got slighted?  Well, here's what I heard.  I read something from Mars.  Here's the scuttlebutt.  Give me the skinny.  There are two people.  Well, there are more Hispanic gentlemen that work over there at XM with us.  But there are two that said, oh, the Spicks don't get turkeys.  Well, that's what was said.  Yes.  Did they say that?  Yes.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Then we're all on a grins.  Yeah.  I thought that was our next slogan. 
[00:56:00]  Look, I love these guys.  I do.  They do a great job for the opening of the show.  Of course.  But you've got to use your brains.  Technically, you're not a CBS employee.  And that's why you didn't get a turkey.  That's right.  You know, if you want to get mad at anyone, if you want to get mad at anyone, get mad at  XM for being so cheap and not getting turkeys for the employees.  That's who you should be mad at.  And maybe XM would have today given out, I don't know, maybe in D.C. they're probably  handing out turkeys.  Stop.  But no one's slighted you because you're Spanish.  No, it was just some dumb secretary here going down a list and checking off employee 
[00:56:30]  names and going, and here's a turkey for this individual.  That's true.  And the blacks didn't get any either.  It was only the white people who got turkeys.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing personal.  Look, let's be honest.  It's a white world.  They're not even giving one to Oprah.  How much are turkeys?  I don't know.  I couldn't even tell you how much a turkey costs.  I feel bad because mine's going to go to waste.  If one of the guys wants mine, you can have it.  Because I thought my girlfriend could cook a turkey.  I don't like to waste food ever.  So I will give it to one of the guys.  If you want the turkey, you can have it. 
[00:57:00]  Jimmy's going to give you some charity.  You can have the turkey.  I'll just come by next week, and I'll make sure you get it.  All right.  No, you can have it, and you can come by today and get the turkey from my place because it's  just going to sit in the freezer, and I don't want to waste it.  My girlfriend, I didn't know she couldn't cook.  Black eye on the way.  Every once in a while, we challenge America because we're in a lot of cities doing this  stupid radio show.  Yes, we are.  We challenge America to come up with a better story than what we have in New York City. 
[00:57:30]  Here is today's story of the day.  Son finds dad's old bones in bed.  This is an amazing story.  Estrained from his father, a gay Brooklyn man came home yesterday to make peace.  So he's gay.  Father, I guess, doesn't approve, so he goes off and lives his life.  And I think three years later, he's like, you know what?  I got to see my father, and I got to make good because maybe he's getting older and stuff. 
[00:58:00]  I just got to make good with my dad, okay?  He goes back home yesterday to make peace, only to make a horrifying discovery.  His mother had been hiding his dad's corpse in the family's apartment for three years.  Three years the guy's been in there just rotting.  How long does it smell?  That's the first thing you got to think of.  Until it dries out.  That's got to take a while, right?  Until it mummifies.  Joanne Iverson, 73, told her son and cops that she never reported her husband's death because 
[00:58:30]  she wanted to continue collecting his Social Security benefits.  Oh, okay.  So there's a little crime involved.  Well, no, but they made a pact, this old couple.  They said, whoever dies first, hide the body so you can keep collecting the money.  Oh, that's sweet.  And it all started with a cute wedding song.  I always go back to that bit.  Yeah.  You hear these horrific endings to these married couples, but it all started with a nice little  wedding song.  And a dance.  And a dance.  And a daughter dancing with daddy. 
[00:59:00]  I wonder what their song was.  50 years ago, maybe.  A long time ago.  Who knows?  The house next door.  Yeah.  I didn't even use him by name, so why is he defending himself?  Who?  Oh, I did, but I didn't say anything bad about him.  I just said he's Mars.  I knew this.  I got an email.  I didn't even use you by name.  Actually, you said two.  There's only two of us here, and I just want to state that I didn't say that, and I wouldn't 
[00:59:30]  piss off white people like that.  Which is, well, I know, here's what I read from you, and it wasn't anything controversial.  All you said was that I didn't get a turkey, and I worked for Opie, and I think it's hard  not to feel slighted.  That was all I read.  Mars, you've got to blame XM.  Exactly.  I mean, I'm not blaming anybody.  CBS, I mean, I tried to tell this to Master Poe yesterday.  CBS has no idea that you guys work for the show.  In their world, they have an employee list, and they want to give turkeys to the CBS employees.  Unfortunately, because of our weird arrangement, yeah, they probably should have taken care 
[01:00:00]  of you guys as well, but they weren't thinking on that level.  No one was slighted on purpose.  Understood, but I just want to reiterate that I do not want to piss off the white man.  Yes, very smart.  Honestly, if one of you guys wants the turkey I have, I will not waste food, so I'll give  it to one of you guys.  If you want it and you're going to have it with your family for the holidays, you can  have it.  Big Cabo was going to give it to you yesterday, but I'm like, eh, you know, my girlfriend  will cook it.  I feel bad you guys didn't get turkeys, but that's, you know, XM probably should have done  something nice.  One of you guys, I'll be happy to give my turkey to, so you and Poe discuss it. 
[01:00:30]  Now, whichever one of you guys wants it can come get it right after the show.  I already gave Poe Anthony's turkey yesterday, I think.  Oh, there we go.  Okay, good.  So, Mars, you got mine.  Well, Mars, actually, let me say one thing.  Yeah.  Nathaniel gave me his.  Did he really?  Yeah, very cool.  Nathaniel's a queer.  Way to upstage everyone, Stan.  Thanks for nothing.  All right, Mars.  Thank you.  All right, there goes Mars.  Kenny has the look of the woe.  And by the way, Jay Moore, line of the century, said yesterday that when Kenny shaved his face, 
[01:01:00]  he looked like an angelfish, and that's exactly what you look like.  That is hysterical.  Here's a look on Club Soda Kenny's face right now.  He's holding the mic, eagerly waiting to talk.  His mouth is half open and his eyes are open, which means bad news is a-coming.  He has the worst poker face.  I don't want to piss you guys off.  He can't wait to piss us off.  He can't wait to piss us off.  That's the beauty of Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  Look, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but...  Yeah, but here it is.  And then he stares at your face.  Can't wait for that bummed out look to... 
[01:01:30]  You look hungry.  Should I sprinkle some food over your head?  Just a pinch.  He'll eat himself to death.  Let me look at your shoes.  Do you have ick on your fins?  You went with an ick joke.  An ick joke.  Kenny, what do you do for the holidays?  I want to swim in and out of the castle.  I like the diver with the bubbles.  He really looks like he might be alive down there.  Better go check it out.  I don't need any food. 
[01:02:00]  I'll just suck up some gravel and spit it out.  There's enough nutrients in that.  Kenny?  Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  Now, Tom Chiasano is very benevolent, and he heard somebody was slighted,  so there's extra turkeys in the kitchen here.  That's nice.  Yes, Master Paul can come over here and get his turkey.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Well, if anybody didn't have a turkey over there,  they are now originally invited to come to the two or three.  Can we get back to this great story?  Son finds dad's old bones in bed.  So where were we? 
[01:02:30]  All right.  So the husband dies, and the wife decides, you know,  I'm going to keep the body for three years,  and I'm going to collect his Social Security, okay?  Her horrific secret was exposed when her 38-year-old son, Paul,  knocked on the apartment door early yesterday.  He had not been home since he came out of the closet well before his dad's death.  Ooh.  I want to see dad, Paul said to his mom.  I want to make everything right.  Isn't that ironic that the son was getting boned in the bed, 
[01:03:00]  and the father turned out that way?  That is some irony, bitter irony.  Look, I've been burying the bone.  Now I want to bury the hatchet.  Wow.  Wouldn't it be really ironic if the dad's skeleton had the pillow between his teeth?  Dad, we have something in common.  The elderly woman, who almost never allowed anyone into the apartment, opened the door. 
[01:03:30]  Occasionally someone popped in.  Like once someone came in, and there's a skeleton there?  Jesus.  He's in the bedroom, she told her son.  What a ghoulish way to break the news.  But she didn't say he's in the bedroom dead.  No.  Oh.  She just said he's in the bedroom.  Hey, surprise.  Paul walked through the filthy apartment.  I guess she's one of these pack rats that we talk about from time to time.  And he's a fudge pack rat.  He wasn't.  A pack gerbil. 
[01:04:00]  He wasn't surprised when he saw him because he was the same weight as all of his friends.  I love when we go back to being 12.  Stupid jokes.  I know.  They're really just awful.  Very childish.  They're horrible people.  We can't be getting paid for this, are we?  No.  No, we're not actually.  No.  I felt the apartment and to his horror found the skeletal remains of his dad, Frank.  75, in a fetal position under a pile of bed covers and clothes. 
[01:04:30]  Jesus.  She piled stuff on top of him?  Yeah.  Did she sleep in the bed with him?  What a good old lady.  That is ghoulish.  Sickened by the discovery, he persuaded his mom to go to the cops.  And at the precinct, Joanne told cops that she and her husband had made a pact to hide the death of whoever passed away first so the surviving spouse could continue collecting social security benefits.  That's sad, man.  I'm like, if you're so worried about money and you have nothing coming in that you have to do that just to keep collecting checks, that's really sad. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Anyway.  Not like I didn't have any grandchildren.  Yeah.  Didn't have to worry about that.  That's sad.  Isn't that creepy, though?  Well, just the fact they had to do it so they could continue to live.  But I always think, like, you know, it started, like, maybe at Inspiration Point.  Hey.  You know them.  What year?  50 years ago?  50 years ago, they're going.  Okay.  They're driving somewhere in a make-out. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  A nice make-out session.  Windows getting all heated.  And it goes steady.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dang 
[01:06:00]  What do we got?  We got Tracy Morgan coming in at 8.30.  Army of anyone in studio in about a half hour.  Yes.  They're the band that, well, it's made up of some STP guys  and Richard Patrick, the lead singer of Filter.  Nice.  They're doing a little sum-sum.  And then we got the guy who wants to try out for the eggnog drinking contest, Anthony.  Where is he?  I see a stool and a bucket.  There's like a chair, an ottoman-type stool, so he can kick his feet up and a bucket. 
[01:06:30]  All right, well, why don't we get him in the next?  It looks like Dick Cavett's coming to vomit.  Yes, he's right now, he's having a smoking jack fit in the other room  so he can throw up on the patched sleeves.  Why don't we get him in next, okay?  Please.  Let's get him in.  And we got the Clay Aiken and Kelly Ripa and Rosie O'Donnell controversy.  We got that, and we also have the gay penguin children's book that's under fire. 
[01:07:00]  Of course it is.  Oh, we will do that next.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, coming to the Opie and Anthony show, Friday, December 1st.  If you have a hankering for rich, creamy, thick holiday eggnog goodness, and a lot of it,  then you need to step up and take the Eggnog Challenge.  For details on how to participate, visit opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com. 
[01:07:30]  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, Friday, December 1st.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow, it's getting crowded in here today.  What, Jimmy?  What is this?  It's good.  Brides of destruction, Jimmy.  I had to look that one up.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:08:00]  Army of anyone is setting up.  We got a dude over there ready to drink some milk.  Thank God we're not shy.  There's like 20 people in here right now.  What's up, man?  I just saw something on YouTube from Fox 25 up there in Boston.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  That's all.  It's on YouTube. 
[01:08:30]  It looks a lot like our assault on the media thing.  Doesn't it?  Hey, man, we have nothing to do with it.  I don't know.  We have nothing to do with it.  Looks like someone got in front of or in the back of a reporter up there in Boston.  Jumping up and down with a wow sticker.  Yelling our names, Opie and Anthony on live TV.  Jim.  Just take a quick peek.  Who is that? 
[01:09:00]  A reporter looks familiar.  A reporter looks miserable.  Oh, did they lose it, too?  Went to some quick tape piece and then went right back to the studio.  Do we have audio on that?  Yikes.  Yeah, go find the audio.  You've got to play that.  I've got to hear that.  It's on YouTube.  We can play it.  It's Fox 25 in Boston.  Good morning, Boston.  One of our guys got on Fox 25 last night.  Yeah.  And what I mean by one of our guys, one of our listeners.  We can't control our listeners.  We can't control them. 
[01:09:30]  If the guy's going to jump up and down behind a reporter with a wow sticker.  How can we stop that?  How can we stop people?  How can we not laugh at it?  Right.  People jumping around behind reporters all the time.  Mm-hmm.  Got a wow sticker in their hand.  What the hell are we supposed to do about it?  Yeah.  All right.  You want to get this guy drinking some milk?  What's going on?  Yeah, that's...  What's your name, bro?  John.  Hey, John.  You want to be in the eggnog drinking contest?  Absolutely.  That's nine days away.  I'm ready for it.  And we have started the tryouts. 
[01:10:00]  So you got a gallon of milk in front of you.  Why did you want skim milk, you wimp?  Hey, man.  I see you got the thickest shit you can get.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  And he's got a potty...  Maybe we ought to add some soap to that.  No kidding.  Wash his mouth out.  No, the deal was, if he drinks the gallon of milk within an hour, even less, by the way,  you'll be in the eggnog drinking contest.  And then you come in here this morning, and then Kenny runs in and says, you want skim milk?  It didn't matter either way.  You gave me the pick of it. 
[01:10:30]  Didn't he ask for skim milk, Kenny?  That's what I was told, and I...  All right.  That's what I was told.  Well, yeah, the skim milk wouldn't give it the same effect, I don't think.  I think you could probably drink skim milk easier than whole milk.  Well, I'll give you guys some good puking sounds.  Well, you're not even...  You have no confidence that you can do this.  Oh, absolutely, I do.  But I'll pull the trigger if necessary.  Oh, okay.  All right, good.  I don't think you're going to be able to do it, though.  So, I've heard that it's impossible.  Have you ever done it? 
[01:11:00]  Actually, I've tried it once, but it came all up.  Yeah.  All right.  How far did you get?  About almost finished, three quarters of the way down.  Wow.  All right, why don't you start drinking?  All right, what time is it?  I got it.  Oh, you got a stopwatch there?  Of course you do, man.  All right, we'll check in with you from time to time in the back of the studio there.  All right, giddy up.  Give us a little, you know, warning, because I am going to step out of the way.  Yeah, raise your hand or get someone's attention, because we've got to move on with the radio show while you do that.  Don't puke on a break.  Yeah, no kidding.  You puke on a break, you're out.  Sonny. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Sonny Farrelly, faithful listener from the Boston area.  What's up, Sonny?  Hey, I got to shoot this one out first.  I have to really thank my nemesis, no filter, Paul, on that one.  He cut the video up.  Oh, it was you last night?  Yeah, that was definitely me.  Yeah, Sonny, you're dope, Sonny.  You call up like we understand why you're calling.  Explain yourself.  Explain yourself.  Yes, explain.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I want to thank no filter, Paul.  For what?  No one knows what you're talking about.  Sonny's is a listener. 
[01:12:00]  No filter, Paul is another listener who happens to do my website merchandise.  And he's an English booze.  I know, I know, I'm such an adult sometimes.  But anyways, I was driving home from a friend's last night, and I noticed a Fox News 25 van  sitting there in Beverly.  And the opportunity was so, so awesome.  I mean, it was like shooting fish out of a barrel.  So I literally called my spotter, called a guy to record this, and I literally stood right 
[01:12:30]  next to the generator of the truck, keep it warm, because it was cold last night, and  waited there for like three minutes before my spotter told me to go into the shot and  do it.  And it was that easy.  And this reporter, I actually met three times prior on trying to do these so-called things  before, and I was never able to get an accessible...  Sonny makes some really captivating radio.  No kidding.  What were you wearing, Sonny?  This description of something is amazing.  What were you wearing? 
[01:13:00]  Help me out, will ya?  Sonny, you could be the worst on-air personality ever.  How about this?  The video's up on YouTube.  Check it out.  But Sonny Farrell, you jumped up and down behind the reporter with a wow sticker, and you  were yelling Opie and Anthony, right?  Yeah, I was yelling Opie and Anthony, and I tried to do the YMCA thing, and then they  went back to the reporter, and the reporter also did an improv as well.  Did he?  What did he do?  Well, it's on that video.  Well, there was no reason to have you on the air then. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, we'll just watch the video.  We'll just watch the video.  And let me tell you something.  Oh my God, you stink, Sonny.  Listen, I'm officially punched out here.  Bye.  All right, and let me add, if that limey bastard, no filter Paul, that beach ball-bellied, tiny  head, Lego-haired jackass calls my house at 1045 at night to tell me that this happened, 
[01:14:00]  I will pick up my shotgun, drive over to his house, and much to his family's pleasure, blow  his head off.  He called you at 1045?  1045.  Do you know I gotta get up, you idiot?  How does he have your number?  Jackass, exactly.  Anthony, that's what I was getting at.  Cell phone.  It's your fault.  Why are you giving no filter Paul your number?  He attempted to get my number down in Atlantic City, and I gave him the wrong number.  Yeah.  It was like watching a guy hit on a chick.  Hope couldn't just say F off, so he's like, ah, and he gave him a few digits off. 
[01:14:30]  I had to finally give him the right one.  No, you did not give him the right one.  Well, that, uh...  Because he obviously would be calling all the time.  Because me, you know, I'm naive and stupid.  You're too nice, Anthony.  And too nice.  And the guy has access now at 1045, I don't care what the hell's happening.  Why did you give him your number?  Why?  There's no reason for no filter Paul to have your phone number.  He just has our number.  He has mine and my girlfriend's number.  But why?  If something's going on one weekend.  I don't know.  He was...  He was...  He was...  He was...  He was...  He was... 
[01:15:00]  He was...  He was...  He was...  Did you answer last night?  Yeah, I know.  It was a text, but the phone still rings, you know?  So I just said, I turned over and told my girlfriend, I go, text him back that I swear  I will go over to his house and shoot him if he ever calls again.  It's...  1045.  Do you know what time we sleep?  I can't feel for you.  We keep hours like ridiculous hours.  I can't feel for you.  There's no reason he should have your phone number.  What?  He's an adult.  And no one...  He's an adult.  I know he's an adult. 
[01:15:30]  You don't have any adults that have your number.  No.  That would call you.  Absolutely not.  Well, you shut your phone off anyway.  I shut my phone off at night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Absolutely.  You're right.  I wanted to call you the night and at 920.  I was like, that's a little bit late.  I won't call you at 8 o'clock.  It's like after 8 o'clock...  Turn your cell phone off.  I can't.  I don't know who's calling.  Sometimes you don't know if it's an emergency.  Just turn it off.  You got to keep for like family emergency stuff.  The phone's got to stay on.  Off the instant feedback, booby man from Brooklyn.  Sonny makes Roland look like Shakespeare. 
[01:16:00]  You know, Roland is a dopey talent booker who has no ability to speak on mic at all.  He's not even that good off mic as a human.  He's not a good talker.  No.  Well, here's what Sonny did last night.  The video's up on YouTube.  Dan.  David, when you start to think about it, the YMCA, the Young Men's Christian Association,  and Tina Turner don't really go together.  Opie and Anthony at the YMCA!  All right, I'm pretty sure it wasn't Tina Turner jumping up and down behind Dan.  No, it wasn't.  By doing it, you can look dickhead...  Hey, Sonny, that's pretty funny. 
[01:16:30]  You didn't hear that dummy he was about to sing?  Opie and Anthony at the YMCA!  And they panicked in the control room and cut the live shot.  Oh, is that funny?  Dan.  David, when you start to think about it, the YMCA, the Young Men's Christian Association,  and Tina Turner don't really go together.  Opie and Anthony at the YMCA!  Dan, I'm pretty sure that wasn't Tina Turner jumping up and down behind Dan.  No, it wasn't.  By doing it, you can look dickhead...  No, it wasn't.  At the YMCA!  That's all you got? 
[01:17:00]  Oh, that was good.  Good job.  Stop keeping your composure and react like a human being.  Yeah.  What the hell was that?  Turn around and go, what the F is your problem?  Yeah, well...  Well, a lot of our Assault on the Media video clips are up on YouTube.  Yeah, if you want to see them.  All right, Gay Penguin children's book, Under Fire.  Now, is this based on something that has actually happened?  Yes.  Okay.  So it's basically a book based on two real penguins.  Two real penguins that happen to be male raising a baby penguin because they found an egg. 
[01:17:30]  A penguin has two daddies.  Yeah.  Everybody loves penguins, right?  No, wrong.  Don't start your news story assuming everybody loves penguins.  I don't love them.  Why don't you love penguins?  Because they have fat stomachs and they make that awful...  I just don't like any animal that makes that noise.  I'm obsessed with hurting penguins.  Did you see March of the Penguins?  I certainly didn't.  Why would I watch that?  I want to punch them. 
[01:18:00]  What about Happy Feet?  No, I won't watch that.  Happy Feet.  Happy Feet.  Happy Feet, the Christopher Reeve story.  No.  Wouldn't that be sad feet?  No, they're happy.  They don't have to take any weight.  Yeah, they're happy because no one's bothering the nails when they grow.  Because no one notices.  Never have to get used to new shoes.  Sleepy Feet.  Everybody loves penguins, right?  We agreed on that.  But a gay-themed children's book featuring them is raising some eyebrows at a school district in Illinois. 
[01:18:30]  Some parents think the book tackles topics that the kids aren't quite ready to handle.  They want to put the book in a special restricted area of the school library.  But school officials say, uh-uh, not so fast.  The issue is not that this book is bad.  It shouldn't be.  They want to ban the book to the gay area.  It's in the back of the library.  Happy Feet, not the Mabel King story.  Or if it's about Paul McCartney's marriage, it's called Happy Foot. 
[01:19:00]  This book is bad.  It shouldn't be burned.  The book that stirred up all the controversy in the Shiloh Village School District is called Antango Makes Three.  The children's book is based on the relationship between two real male penguins at the New York Central Park Zoo.  The pair bonded, hatched an abandoned egg, and then acted as surrogate parents to the baby penguin.  Oh, boy, it's March to the Faggots. 
[01:19:30]  Tragic note, though.  Did you hear about that?  One of the penguins went home and found the bones of his father laying in bed.  And can the gay community, look, I understand you guys take a lot of flack, but you don't have to tie everything into your cause.  These two are not gay.  They're just two male penguins that have some kind of nurturing thing.  Taking care of a little penguin.  They're not fighting for gay penguin rights.  They don't know what they are.  Don't want to get married even though they're both dressed in those little tuxedos.  Ready for a wedding.  Exactly.  Just waiting for someone to marry them. 
[01:20:00]  What state do we have to go to now?  Jesus.  No one that I ever talked to ever said, get rid of the book.  All they're saying is, let's put it on a shelf separately so that parents can have the decision when they think that their child is ready.  It's ready to read about homosexual penguins.  What?  Yeah, is your kid really like, I don't think you can handle this two penguins racing there. 
[01:20:30]  No one cares.  Parents aren't worried about that.  They're just worried about the pictures of them trading off the egg like they do, usually, but only front to back.  Instead of belly to belly.  Hey, we got a milk update, Anthony.  Oh, yes?  He has finished his first half gallon.  You're kidding.  First half gallon's done, man.  Dude.  Wow, you're good.  Were you thirsty?  A little bit.  Did you eat anything or drink anything before?  Hell no.  Wow.  You had that awful pasty milk breath.  A little sour milk breath. 
[01:21:00]  You want to come smell it?  Nah, milk breath is awful.  You just hock up a real good one, though.  It almost tastes like you got your mouth closed all night.  You wake up, it's like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  Pretty skinny guy, too.  He's chugging this milk.  Is it getting a little harder?  It's a professional.  It's getting a little harder.  It's all right, though.  It's not bad.  With the milk.  People say I say milk wrong.  How are you supposed to say milk?  I say milk.  How do you say it?  M-E-L-K?  I think it's kind of a Long Island thing that happens from time to time with my speech. 
[01:21:30]  Long Island.  Milk.  What are you doing to be a hot, older woman?  She's a mouth?  All right, more to the Penguin story here.  This fall, a school committee recommended putting the books and others like it on a separate shelf, requiring parental permission.  A pile on fire.  But the superintendent rejected that.  Good.  The book was kept on the shelves, available for kindergartners and other elementary school kids.  We have different religions in our library.  We have different races represented in our library.  And this needs to be represented as well. 
[01:22:00]  You know how they knew the penguins were gay?  When the handlers would throw in fish, both the penguins would go, yuck, and run away from it.  LAUGHTER  We have to be represented as well.  It is an appropriate book.  Now, a school board committee is studying what to do with the book.  But the board president thinks, legally, it will have to stay unsegregated on the general shelves. 
[01:22:30]  So right now, when it comes to the penguins, I guess they're just going to have to go with the flow.  Jesus.  Wow.  Will they?  I absolutely thought he was going to say something that would have gotten him removed from the air.  Yeah.  That sounded like one of those jokes.  Right now it looks like the book's going to have to stay up your...  What? Is this on?  Oh, Jesus.  Back to you, Joy.  Horrified.  Where do you stand on the faggots? 
[01:23:00]  Speaking of faggots, here's Todd with the weather.  I would love to see a newsman just completely lose it.  It's going to happen, by the way.  Yeah, they're under a lot of pressure.  Under a lot of pressure.  Newsertainment.  Milk guy, how are you?  Hanging out there, man.  All right, listen, we've got to step aside for a couple seconds here.  If you puke during the break, we're going to kill you.  Slow down on the milk until we come back.  You're drinking it pretty quickly. 
[01:23:30]  That's right.  You slow down a little bit.  Also on the show, Tracy Morgan.  I see Keith the Cop wandering around.  That can only mean one thing.  He's got a homeless guy because the homeless shopping spree is on the way.  Oh, great.  And we have the band here.  Are they here yet or no?  Army of anyone also going to play a tune or two for us today.  Keith.  Yeah, I got a fellow John today.  He's actually like a homeless heavy metal rocker guy.  He's got his guitar with him and everything, so it might work well with the theme for the day.  Oh, God.  We've got to talk to him.  Homeless heavy metal rocker guy. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Wonderful.  The homeless shopping spree coming to the Opie and Anthony show soon.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.

[01:25:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Can I tell you, it just starts with me and Ant and Jim Norton just sitting around shooting the S.  A mere hour, hour and a half later, there's like at least 20, 25 people in the studio now.  The studio's packed.  They're setting up equipment.  We got the dude in the corner over here drinking his milk.  Yeah, Milk Guy, we had to move.  We had to move him right by the bathroom.  How you holding up back there?  Doing all right?  Yeah.  I'm wondering about this guy over here.  Yeah, he's trying out for the eggnog drinking contest, which is nine days away. 
[01:26:00]  It's a great little show we do every year.  To get everyone into the Christmas spirit.  Yeah.  The holiday spirit.  You feeling any ill effects at all?  It's starting to feel a little full.  It's all right, though.  Just full?  And how much of that is left?  Just about half.  Yeah, well.  It's down to half of his last half.  We have Army of Anyone going to play a couple songs.  We got Tracy Morgan coming in and we got a homeless guy that Keith the Cop found.  Thank God, this guy's out of his mind.  Who has a guitar with him? 
[01:26:30]  For the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah, I was just talking to Richard Patrick and the DeLeo brothers, man.  I can't wait to get them on the air and see what they're all about, Army of Anyone.  Keith, what do we got today?  We're also trying out homeless guys for the homeless shopping spree.  That's what?  What are we up to?  A little over two and a half weeks away?  Something like that?  Yeah, about two and a half weeks away.  And I ran into John the other day outside Starbucks on 47th Street.  Yeah.  And I figured he would be a good contestant.  Yeah.  What's up, John?  I don't know yet. 
[01:27:00]  Don't know yet?  Too early, huh?  Yeah.  Not enough Budweiser.  Ah.  Noticed a lot of homeless guys like drinking.  Oh, sure.  Noticed that.  Not surprised.  Yeah, but...  You know.  Got to kind of...  What else are you going to do all day, right?  I got to get that kick.  I got to get that kick.  Yeah?  So you just like drink beer all day?  No, I drink about four.  Four?  Then I play all day.  And then you play.  Yeah.  So you loosen up with a few beers.  And then you play.  And what do you put a little case out or something like that? 
[01:27:30]  Or a hat or something?  No.  You're not playing for cash.  You're just playing for the fun of it.  Yeah.  Well, how does your guitar not get stolen?  I sleep on it.  Okay.  That's got to be good for it.  There you go.  That's got to be good for your back.  The Fender Posturepedic.  Yeah.  No kidding.  If you can tell that, you know, if I'm really messed up, I'm laying out there on top of it.  But if I'm not messed up, just sleeping, then it's on top of me.  Yeah.  So, you know, has anyone ever tried to grab it and take off? 
[01:28:00]  Three of them.  Three?  Three guitars.  Have been stolen?  Yeah.  Wow.  Guys that are a little bigger than you, I guess, huh?  No, there's just more of them.  More of them.  And gangbangers.  It's like a jungle out there.  Yeah.  It is just like the plains of the Serengeti.  So, why are you homeless, sir?  Yeah.  What happened?  Where'd it go wrong?  Can't pay rent.  Why?  That would make it homeless.  I moved up here.  Moved up here from where?  Arizona.  Arizona.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  Why would...  Up here?  Why would you move?  I never understood this. 
[01:28:30]  Were you homeless in Arizona?  No.  Oh, no.  Why'd you come to the big city?  For fame, glory?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What year was that about?  94.  Oh.  You came here to make it in the band in 94 as a musician?  Oh, I started out as a photographer doing that.  Then I got run over by all these other guys.  You know, it's already in the fashion industry.  Too much competition.  Yeah.  And since I wasn't working, I couldn't pay for film and all that, so I hocked the camera. 
[01:29:00]  And then, did you have a place to live here in New York?  No.  No.  So, you came from Arizona to nothing.  Right.  Why would you do something like that?  That seems a little odd.  Because there's nothing out there.  Nothing in Arizona?  No.  But you had a place to live.  And it was warm.  If you're going to be homeless, you might as well pick a warm place.  Yeah.  That's true.  It got boring.  It got boring.  Yeah.  So, it's better to be homeless in an exciting place than have a roof over your head in a boring place. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Homeless people can't make it out there either.  No?  So, I had to get a job, $3.50 an hour.  Doing what?  Furniture, factory stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of stuff homeless people do.  But didn't like doing that?  How do you get your money for food and stuff?  Boring.  Oh, I just go to the soup kitchen or something like that. 
[01:30:00]  Plenty of outlets for homeless people to eat in.  There's a hundred and four churches out here.  Yeah.  That serve.  Yeah, New York kind of takes care of their homeless.  We always talk about how New York doesn't treat their homeless well, but there's always  somewhere to eat or grab a fresh set of clothes or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, but I had a friend of mine get me this guitar.  Yeah?  I say we have him play the guitar.  I think so.  Can you play a little something?  Sober?  Yeah, play something.  Is that a problem?  Right. 
[01:30:30]  Well, let's see how you sound sober.  He's got a little amp and everything.  I don't know if we can hook up into some of his other stuff.  No, no.  I don't think he'll set that up.  I don't think Army, if anyone, wants us using their equipment.  Yeah.  Get started.  Hook yourself up, and we'll just plug into his amp.  You got a battery?  Oh, hold on.  We got some action over at the other side of the studio.  There we go, milk guy.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, well.  That's what happened. 
[01:31:00]  I hate milk right now.  Save me the big chunks.  Oh, God, that's just going to make me throw up.  You want any more thick milk?  Have another sip of thick.  Yeah, have another sip of thick, creamy.  Wow, are you boofing?  Have another thick milk.  No, thanks, Jim.  You want some cream, some heavy cream?  What happened, man? 
[01:31:30]  You were doing so well.  I got more than halfway done with this one.  Have another sip.  Yeah, have another sip.  Wash down that puke with another sip.  Look out, Sam.  Thick cow milk.  Just a little to that side.  Yeah, go for the chug.  Chug, chug, chug, chug.  Oh, God.  Pussy cow udders.  We're trying to see if you got what it takes to beat the eggnog drinking contest.  His eyes are tearing.  It's all right.  It's got puke eyes.  It's good for you.  Milk is good for you.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:00]  It's white and red.  His puke has got red in it.  Yeah, what are you, got an ulcer?  Chocolate milk this morning.  Oh, good.  Way to start off.  Well, that might not be the chocolate milk, though.  There might be some stomach lining.  Danny has seen it all, but look at the face on Danny.  Danny's not happy.  What's up, Danny?  It was red.  Was it?  It definitely looked like there was some blood. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, God, dude.  Was it stink, Jim?  Strawberry quick.  I can't smell it yet.  It could be neither, but it can't be good.  Come here, Jimmy.  Smell a little bit.  No, I don't like the smell.  How much you got left?  Yeah, you better keep drinking, you know?  If you want in on this eggnog drinking contest.  He's got like 35% of it left.  You haven't impressed us yet.  Wow, he is chugging it.  He is chugging.  Make a little more gurgling when you vomit.  I don't know how that's done, but I like the...  His is coming out in like huge pockets of vomit. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Oh, look.  A little burp.  You might be all right now.  That's all you need is a little burp.  Yeah.  Clear the way.  What do you think?  Is it going to stay down, do you think?  Yeah.  Would you spin in a circle?  Whoa.  We got a homeless guitar dude.  Homeless guitar dude.  How's it going over there?  Papa Rock.  What?  Papa Rock.  What's that?  Papa Rock.  What?  Is that your name?  That's what they call me. 
[01:33:30]  Papa Rock?  I'm too old to be kid rock.  He looks like a crack.  A rock.  Papa Rock.  Yeah, he does look like a crackhead Willie Nelson.  I think it is.  All right, you want to play a little something for us?  Yeah, a little bit.  Just, uh...  His brain's very heavy.  Okay.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  He's shaking a lot.  Yeah.  Ooh.  He's nervous and going through the DTs. 
[01:34:00]  Sounds good.  Hold on.  Did you finish the milk?  It's done.  All right.  The milk is done.  What do you guys think?  Anthony, what do you think?  We want him in the eggnog drinking contest?  Yeah, he did a good job.  And he kept going.  You want some more puke?  Yeah, we do.  Look out.  Look out.  I have to pull the trigger here, guys.  All right.  He's going to pull the trigger just for the hell of it.  To make it look good.  The eggnog drinking contest, nine days away.  Hold on with the guitar.  How's that for gurgle? 
[01:34:30]  That was a good gurgle.  Almost guy's not happy.  He's not puking because you're playing.  Don't worry, bro.  No.  The audience is where he's not.  Right.  It could be best puking ever on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's a good gurgle, man.  Best puke ever. 
[01:35:00]  You getting any Listerine?  This guy is so in.  We'll see you.  I like when it sounds like you're testing out an outboard motor.  Right.  In one of those 55-gallon drums full of water.  That's all the puke is coming out, man.  That's it.  All right.  Good boy.  You did great.  What's your name again?  John.  John, you want to plug anything?  Say hi to anybody.  What's up?  Everybody in Woodbridge.  What's going on to everybody over at the deli in Woodbridge, New Jersey?  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  John did a great job.  We'll see him in nine days for the eggnog drinking contest.  Good boy, John. 
[01:35:30]  We should get an army of anyone in here as well.  Yeah.  Hey, homeless guitar dude.  How's it going over there?  He doesn't seem to be able to.  What is he?  Tuning?  Yeah.  Oh, what's happening?  Why let something get in the way like tuning?  What's going on?  Can you get the amp up?  Does the amp work or?  Why would it work?  Why would it?  Homeless guy.  His battery's ran out.  Mike the amp.  Oh, wow.  It's Jimmy Homeless. 
[01:36:00]  Tony, no homie.  Eddie Van Houseless.  Eddie Van Houseless.  Just paranoid.  Oh, what happened? 
[01:36:30]  What happened?  That isn't whatever you did.  It wasn't good.  Looks like he's electrocuting himself.  Got a short in it.  You got a short?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I hate when that happens.  It's an old guitar, man.  Oh, he's in. 
[01:37:00]  I want him to do this with the guitar for the homeless shopping spree.  He's the greatest.  Yeah.  He can entertain the rest of the people there.  Sure.  At the mall.  And then Gray Wolf could do a little something.  It'll be wonderful.  All right.  What's going on?  What's going on, Keith?  It's a battery.  It's a battery?  All right.  We'll get back to Homeless Guitar Dude in a second.  Army of anyone we got to.  Yeah.  Let's get Army of anyone in here, man.  They've been waiting around watching this three-ring circus that is the Opie and Anthony 
[01:37:30]  show.  I love Homeless Guitar Guy.  I think that sound is hysterical.  It's just like.  Maybe he could come with us over to.  I wouldn't see any reason to dismiss him yet.  Maybe he could come over.  No.  Maybe he could take the walk.  Yeah.  Why not?  That would be good if he could take the walk and play us over.  Yeah.  He'll do a little more.  Yeah.  David Lee Roofless coming in from Doug in Austin.  He's not a guitar player.  No, I know.  Come on. 
[01:38:00]  Keep it on topic.  We were going with the guitar.  People.  Be creative.  I was trying to work Jimmy Page into it, but I had nothing.  I had nothing.  That's a tough one.  Where's the band?  What's up?  Where?  Oh, they're just going to play?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, they got like mic stuff.  They're plugging in their guitars.  Yeah.  I wonder if it'll sound different.  I bet it does. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, that was some rendition of, it was Paranoid?  Mm-hmm.  Was it Paranoid?  That figures, doesn't it?  Yep.  Yeah, of course he's got Paranoid.  In his repertoire.  Are you making, he's got a sign release.  What's he going to do?  So?  What do you do for a dress?  Just put an arrow pointing towards the window?  Yeah.  All right, we got the band in the studio, Army of Anyone, getting ready to perform for us. 
[01:39:00]  It's a new band formed by Filter Frontman, Richard Patrick, and you got the DeLeo Brothers from Stone Temple Pilots in there.  And you also got Ray.  And you also got Ray.  That's you, right?  Yeah.  And you used to play with David Lee Roth?  Yeah.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Wow.  How long?  Eight years.  Eight years?  Wow.  Wow.  Which years were those?  The last eight years.  The last eight years.  Okay.  The last eight.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Cool.  How was that?  Fun?  It was pretty, yeah.  It was interesting.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right, we got Richard Patrick still warming up.  So what do you want to do?  You want to take a break?  You want to go on to something else?  Well, if we're going to take a break, we might as well take one while to warm it up.  All right, why don't we do that?  Yeah, we'll do that.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony Show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opieandanthony.com. 
[01:40:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show getting back on track here.  I got to tell you, we're very, very excited to have Army of Anyone in studio.  I'm a huge STP fan.  I'm a huge filter fan.  So this works out perfect for me.  Hey, Richard, what's up? 
[01:40:30]  We're on the air.  Oh, your mic's not on.  Oh, boy.  You got to press a button.  Yeah.  Press one of the buttons.  Oh, boy.  His mic's not working.  All right, we're getting a mic to you.  Why would it?  Why would it be working?  Well, maybe because we have 20 microphones in studio today.  Hey, Richard, what's up?  Hi.  We haven't seen Richard Patrick in quite a while.  It has been a while.  Talking about the old days.  We hung backstage at the River Rave in Boston. 
[01:41:00]  And then the DeLeo brothers were reminding us that STP played that show, and we introduced  them.  That was actually the day we met, I think, at the River Rave.  Was it?  What's that?  What's that?  The day you met.  That's what he was talking about.  The big concert up there in Boston they have every year?  I don't think they had it last summer.  That was when we met.  Really?  We might want to get him a microphone, too.  I don't know. 
[01:41:30]  If I was producing the show, that would be something I would really think would be important.  There goes E-Rock.  All right.  Yeah.  It's much better when you can hear both guys in a conversation with a cord that's barely  long enough.  We're so prepared.  I got it, man.  Yeah, we're doing good.  So, you know, it's good to be here, man.  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  That's a star ago.  Now he's got to lean forward to talk. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  So they got a couple songs for us.  And three of these guys, actually, I don't know if all of you guys know my friend Adam  Dubin, they're all friends with Adam, who did the movie from the American Dummy films  with Otto and George and Louis Black's Sidesplitters.  Yeah, you guys were big fans of those movies, right?  What movies?  Well, maybe not.  I think it was the brothers that were into it.  Yeah.  They saw Jimmy and went, oh, my God, you're the dude from American Dummy.  American Dummy.  Yeah, American Dummy.  Everyone I show that to loves it.  Yeah.  It's a movie about Otto and George.  It plays a ventriloquist. 
[01:42:30]  I get to make out with Nina Hartley at the end of that one, which is really nice.  Porn star?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Right after she did a scene, I made out with her.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  All right.  So are there mics working to play?  Because, I mean, none of the mics are working for these guys to talk.  Yeah.  Once they play, the mics are live.  It should be all right.  Cool.  After something else.  All right, Richard, Army of Anyone, what's the deal with the band?  The deal is this.  We got together primarily because we love music, and we wanted to bring something new and wonderful 
[01:43:00]  to the planet.  That was really the idea behind the band.  What planet?  This planet.  Planet Earth.  Oh, Earth.  Okay.  Yeah.  Sorry.  There were a few to choose from in this solar system.  You guys want to?  Well, you know, the entire solar system is included in this musical.  You might as well.  Who else is, like, representing Saturn?  I don't know.  You know.  Because Saturn isn't represented.  You know what I mean? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  So why not?  It doesn't even know it's there, you know?  We know it's there.  That's what makes us so special.  Dude, the sound goes out there and never stops, so who knows who's listening, man.  It goes to Intrometa and the other galaxies, man.  You know what I mean?  Aliens listening.  Do you think if aliens were listening, like, we would be sitting back listening to some  alien music?  Come on.  It would have to work both ways.  Yeah, both ways.  Give us some alien music.  It's going to go right to Uranus.  Yeah, see?  There you go.  Another planet in the solar system.  I just hope no aliens get K-Fed's music, because they might attack us. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  K-Fed.  You into the K-Fed?  Is that the dude that, um...  Brittany.  Her husband.  Just got, like, the divorce and stuff?  Yeah, now they're calling him K-Fed-X.  I feel sorry for those folks.  It's kind of funny.  Who comes up with that crap?  Really?  You feel sorry for the guy who likes K-Fed?  I don't know anybody that goes through a divorce.  It's bad.  Well, tell me about it.  It seems like he did it to himself, though.  I realize every three months how bad a divorce is when I write a check.  Yeah.  My ex-wife, the lottery winner. 
[01:44:30]  Jesus Christ, I was in construction.  Couldn't divorce me then.  Had to wait until I joined a radio show.  And made some real money.  Yeah.  It happens.  Why?  Happened to you?  No, actually, I just got married three weeks ago.  Oh, okay.  Congratulations.  I'm actually in that warm-up honeymoon type thing.  Yeah.  My wife's right over there, actually.  Oh, is she?  Well, God bless.  And the best.  What was your wedding song?  The theme from The Deer Hunter.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Because there is kind of a nice song in there. 
[01:45:00]  Cavatina?  Cavatana?  Yeah, there is a nice song in there.  Yeah, it's great.  I don't think.  It's actually an old classical piece.  I can't remember.  Yeah.  But, like, you hear The Deer Hunter and think, was it the music that was playing when they  were playing Russian roulette?  Or is it?  No.  There was very little music in there, actually.  It was actually the song.  Yeah, it's like one of my favorite movies.  And I always thought that was beautiful.  The really funny thing was, is after they just did their vows, they're walking out, and we're 
[01:45:30]  all kind of looking around, and the guy was playing the theme from Star Wars.  Oh, man.  Which was pretty cool.  I am an out-of-the-closet Star Wars fan.  Yeah.  I make no bones about it, too.  I'm called geek all the time, and I mean, I buy every single thing that Lucas puts out,  the box set and stuff.  Do you really?  Like, 20 times.  Yeah, I bought the same movies 80 times.  Do you know about, like, Master Replica, like, the real nice movie prop replicas?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  I have...  You got some...  I have 10 items.  I have a huge MR collection.  What's, like, your prize possession?  I mean, the prize that I just got was the big, nice clone two-per helmet that just showed  up at my house, but I have Anakin, and Anakin's lightsaber, and Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber  from Episode 3 and 4.  Jesus.  In 4, it's all beat up and, like, looks like it's been through, you know, hell, and then,  like, the Episode 3 is, like, sparkling, like, totally pristine and new. 
[01:46:30]  So, we had a person come over and do some interviews individually at each one of our  houses, so he gets to my house, and I'm like, oh, let me get an idea of what the other guys  did.  So, at the end of Richards, I see him, no sound, just runs out in his backyard around his pool  with his lightsaber, with his star...  Trooper helmet on?  Trooper helmet on in his underwear, batting animals and batting...  With a little lightsaber.  Oh, that's cool. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, you know.  Right on.  Hitting trees and animals.  Yeah.  Hey, we're running out of time here.  We should get a couple songs from Army of Anyone.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you guys are playing all over the place.  You got a website where people could go to get the tour dates?  Armyofanyone.com or myspace.com slash armyofanyone.  Tag World.  We're on Tag World.  But, yeah, the main one's armyofanyone.  Armyofanyone.com.  There's a whole bunch of tour dates you guys are doing.  You know, you got everywhere from Georgia, Florida, Florida. 
[01:47:30]  There's a million dates here.  So, armyofanyone.com, go for the dates.  There's just too many to give out.  And when you're doing your gigs, are you guys doing a little filter, a little STP, and a lot of Army of Anyone?  Is that the deal?  I'm sorry.  When you're doing your shows, are you guys playing the gamut?  Like, you're doing some STP songs?  Absolutely.  You're doing the filter songs?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, we totally honor and respect each other's past.  And, I mean, I got to be honest.  We just played a concert last night in Boston. 
[01:48:00]  And it was just unreal how much fun we had.  And, you know, these guys are playing Welcome to the Fold.  And it's just unreal how amazing it's turned out.  And I'm having a blast.  Scott's lyrics are fantastic.  And I'm just having a great time singing them.  And, you know, it's pretty bizarre.  It's pretty amazing.  Because I'm a huge STP fan.  And to be in the middle of the Dalios and backed up with Ray Luzier playing drums. 
[01:48:30]  And we're doing, like, Big Bang Baby.  Oh, that's really cool.  And the pie and just, you know, it's just pretty astounding.  Can you do one of those before we get out of here?  What's that?  Can you do an STP song before we get out of here?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  What are we going to do today?  I don't think we have the capo.  We need a capo for one of those for the STP song.  But we're going to do, I think we're going to do a little filter.  Yeah?  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  What do you want to play first for us? 
[01:49:00]  Are we set?  I don't think you're getting our signal.  I don't think our amps are, actually, our acoustics are mic'd.  All right.  They're running around trying to figure out.  Yeah, I know.  Tim's running around trying to figure it out.  Everything works before.  Hey, any football fans?  You guys football fans?  Giants.  Well, we've got to do football picks every week.  So, you know, while they try to figure out what the hell is going on,  can someone do my football picks over there? 
[01:49:30]  I'll just yell out a game.  You yell out a team.  That's how it's going to work.  You've got the Jaguars and the Buffalo Bills.  Someone who plays football.  Hey, Mark, Pollock, come here.  Just anyone.  I don't even care.  I've got the Jaguars.  We've got the Jaguars.  I do care.  I thought you'd say Bills because Bills are at home.  All right.  Steelers and the Ravens.  Steelers.  Huh?  Steelers.  All right.  Drummer.  Dude, I yell Steelers.  All right.  Bears, Patriots.  Don't screw this one up. 
[01:50:00]  Patriots at home.  Very good.  Yeah, I think the Bears are finally going down.  Dolphins, Lions.  Dolphins.  Dolphins.  Oh, boy.  Can you pick a home team, please?  I'm dying over here.  Broncos, Chiefs.  Broncos, Chiefs.  Broncos.  Broncos.  Holy crap.  Good.  One for five this week for me.  You never know.  Thanks, guys.  Today's football pick sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  We're going to try the band over here now?  Sure hope so.  All right.  Let me hear something.  Is this working?  All right.  We might have something going on finally.  All right.  Army of anyone.  Richard Patrick.  Take it away.  One, two, three.  No.  No.  We can't hear it.  I hear it.  Oh, my God.  Just heard the drums, and then it was like, yeah, that works.  You hear the drums regardless.  Isn't it odd that the homeless guy was able to play?  The homeless guy was able to play.  All he needed was a battery. 
[01:51:00]  It just never, ever ends.  There's a lot of panicking going on.  Great.  Well, we have the band here.  They're all ready to go.  We're all ready to go, and there's something technical not working.  We don't know where it's coming from.  Can't wait to see Minnelli's newsletter on this.  Yeah, no kidding.  We're going to send us volume 18 of the newsletter.  Guess what, John?  If you're listening, we know where the show went bad.  Yeah.  You don't have to freaking write it out.  Guys, I think of a live appearance in studio. 
[01:51:30]  We should have the equipment working.  What are we doing now?  I hear something.  Oh, that's a purdy.  It's a purdy guitar sound.  All right.  Those are your levels.  How about now?  Can you hear us?  Yeah, we can hear you.  Yeah.  Now that we're running out of show.  Yeah, everyone.  All right.  We're going to try this for the third time.  Army of anyone.  Richard Patrick, everyone.  Oh, we are.  This song is called...  Doug, are we working?  We're working. 
[01:52:00]  Yep.  We're good.  We're ready.  They've got everything now.  You got us?  Yeah, it looks like we're ready to go.  It doesn't seem to matter.  Holy crap.  I'm going to have a heart attack. 
[01:52:30]  No guitar.  No guitar.  I'm going to pull you all out.  I'm going to pull you all out.  I'm going to pull you all out.  We'll put all the good stuff.  I'm going to teach.  I'll teach you how to cheat. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, it ain't no matter  Yeah  It doesn't seem no matter  When it's all that you are  It doesn't seem no matter  When it's all that you are 
[01:53:30]  Hey  I try to mess your mess  I try to mess all of you  I wanna mess you all down  I wanna mess the truth  It doesn't seem no matter 
[01:54:00]  I can't wait  I can't wait  I can't wait  Out in the streets, a girl who tries to cheat  Yeah, it ain't no matter  Yeah, it ain't no matter  When it's all that night, yeah 
[01:54:30]  It ain't no matter  When it's all that night, yeah  I want to let you know  Yeah, I want to know 
[01:55:00]  When it's all that night, yeah  Yeah, I want to know  Yeah, I want to know  Yeah, I want to know  Yeah, I want to know 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, I want to know  Yeah, it ain't no matter  When it's all that night, yeah  When it's all that night, yeah  When it's all that night, yeah 
[01:56:00]  Yeah  Yeah  It sounded good to us, but the equipment  That was called a shakedown  It, uh, uh, well, uh, how do I break this to you?  It sounded great in here, but, uh, yeah  Uh, was anything going out? 
[01:56:30]  I don't know what was going out  You don't want to know the feedback on this  People just can't hear it  Wow  Yeah, exactly  Ah  You got to take our word for it, I guess  It was awesome  Yeah, take our word for it  It's probably the worst mix I've ever heard  Is that what they  From a live performance, yeah  Oh, yeah, just, I mean, I can't sugarcoat it  God damn it  Not a deal with you guys, it's the mix  Whatever was coming through 
[01:57:00]  I could hear the guitar  Then I couldn't hear the guitar  And then the drums were too loud  The drums were loud, the vocals were loud  And then the vocals were in the background  Someone's head  Coming off another microphone  Wow  We need someone's head on a plate  Wow  So, um, we're good  We're cool  Yeah, great  We're going along  Great  Good times, keep on trucking  You get an opportunity to play in front of an S-load of people  And, uh, that's what comes out  It has nothing to do with the band  Army of anyone  I want to kill somebody 
[01:57:30]  Let's just put it that way, Richard  We got to make some adjustments on the satellite  Tracy  Sending up the coordinates  I see Tracy Morgan in the other studio just laughing at us  He's watching us as we crash and burn  Whatever  You feel right?  You'll find the black box  You'll be fine  What's up, Tracy?  You'll find the black box  What's going on?  How you doing, Mr. Morgan?  What's up, man?  Tracy Morgan, big TV star  I watch him every week  Yeah  Yeah, get over here 
[01:58:00]  We're, uh  He's good  What's up, bros?  Hey, Tracy Morgan  Acoustic  Tracy wandering around the room  Saying hi to  Army of anyone  Which is Richard Patrick  And the DeLeo brothers  I'm beyond livid  I don't even know what  I don't even know what to say  Pop on that mic  I don't even know what to say  Hi, Tracy  Hey, what's up, Tracy?  Poor man comes in here  Are we  Are we going to try another song?  No, they're just walking out  They're just  Huh?  You have our single? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, we can play the single  I guess  That's what you want  Yeah, we have the band here  All the equipment  But just play  Play a single  He's not even on mic  How in the hell  Did that happen?  Huh?  What happened?  Is that a recording?  Every time we do this  Is the first time it ever happened?  Yeah  It's not you guys  No  It's nothing to do with you guys  It's the mix  No, it's not  Can we go to 
[01:59:00]  What should we do?  Huh?  Talk to Tracy  That's a complete train wreck  Hi, Tracy  What's up, Tracy?  Tracy Morgan  Richard, you can jump on a mic or something  Big star  I don't blame you  If you want to just run away  You  You're a big star  Hit show  Look at you  Come on, man  We were in Philly a couple weeks ago  Made the transition  Look at that rock  You were able to make the jump  What was that, man?  30  What was that?  20  Like 20,000 people  That's a lot of people, man  It was up there, man  The ONA traveling virus  I love it  I have a good time 
[01:59:30]  And you were telling us about this  The new TV show you were doing  And look at you  You're blowing up in front of our eyes  Again  Tracy, again  Yeah, it feels good to be getting that cake, man  You know what I'm telling you?  I like the NBC money, man  I watch every week  And the reason the show is a hit  Is because finally someone is allowing you to be Tracy Morgan  It doesn't even look like you're following a script  It looks like you're pretty much improv-ing  It's Tina Fey  It's Tina Fey?  That's the writing  The writing we have on there  It feels good to be a part of 
[02:00:00]  Like a bomb squad writing crew  A hardcore writing crew  Yeah  That, you know  We got people like Robert Carlock  Who was the head writer at Friends  And Reggie  Who was there with Will and Grace  And then Tina Fey  She's a known home run hitter  Being with Saturday Night Live  But she knows my voice  And I get to fly over the cuckoo's nest every week  How cool is that?  Yeah, right on  You know what I'm saying?  Jack got an Oscar for that, man  I'm flying over the cuckoo's nest on this  My drawers and everything  We did an episode 
[02:00:30]  Last week  We filmed the episode  Where we're saying the word nigga a hundred times  So I'm like, yeah, let's push the envelope  Really?  Yeah  See, we're white  We're not allowed to say the word  Yeah  That's what's coming out with this Kramer thing  Oh my God  Michael Rich's special guest on that episode  He's on fire right now, baby  He certainly is  He'll rock the layers  But if you're white, you can't say the word  That's what they're telling us  He said it  He's on fire  Yeah, look at him  He's on every show  He stole the headlines from OJ  Yeah, he's on fire  And if the Cribs get a hold of him 
[02:01:00]  He's going to be on fire again  Because  Well, he go to Arkansas  Go to a state that's all white like Arkansas  And they know for a minute  Then bust back out  They're going to give him a sitcom  Yeah  He's going to be on CBS  But you're going to get a sitcom  Give him something  He had a little bit of trouble  But yeah, you're right  He's all over TV  Yeah, man  He's all over the place  Hey, he's honest, man  You know the guy at all?  No, I never met him  Never met him  In my life, but  He wigged out  He was in a rage  He was in a rage there, Richard 
[02:01:30]  Richard Patrick over there  Richard Patrick, they finally got a microphone that worked  He was in a rage  Yeah, you could say  He was just like  My Lord  Losing it, man  Isn't it insane, though?  Everybody's focusing on him  I like the guy that was heckling him  Tore him a new asshole  I say that  Let's dump it  Yeah, well, that's why he went into the rage  Because, you know, the guy from the balcony was speaking the truth  Yeah, he told me he was a reject  He wasn't funny  He hasn't done anything since Seinfeld  And that just  You know, he just lost it 
[02:02:00]  You think that's what it was?  Oh, absolutely  Yeah, that flipped the switch in his head  Because all the Seinfeld  Just like Bobby Brown  Go get a reality TV show  All the Seinfeld guys want to make it on their own  They want to make it on their own  So did all the Jacksons  Well, good point there  So did Tito and Jermaine  But only Michael made it  Yeah  That's a good point  Yeah, he just snapped  That's why I'm glad  You know, it was nice to be on Saturday Night Live  Because it was an ensemble  And it was a variety TV show 
[02:02:30]  Yeah  So, you know, it was nice to be the black guy on Saturday Night Live  Because you get your own section of the show  You were on there for a while, huh?  Seven Joints?  Yeah  Seven Joints  It wasn't one of those  Hey, can I ask you guys a question?  Yeah  Sure  And my family  Yeah  Of course  And my family  What happened?  I feel like it  I feel like it  We did a show in Philly  And I went on behind the dude  What was the dude that bombed?  That scared me, man  Jimmy Schubert  That scared me  Oh, man 
[02:03:00]  Wait, did you go on early?  Yeah, Tracy went on after  Oh, okay, yeah  At the Philly show  Yeah  Yeah, you went on after Jimmy Schubert  He got booed off the stage, basically  And didn't acknowledge the boos  Continued with his act  And that set the table up perfectly  For Tracy Morgan  Insanity  Certain people don't want to come off the stage  It's crazy, right?  I love  The hardest show that we did  That I felt was the one in Boston  At the Worcester joint  Yeah, when I headlined  I was like, wait a minute  Then I went on behind this dude  And he's like 
[02:03:30]  Thunder  I'm like  Like everything you said was thunder  And I'm like, oh  Not only am I black  I'm headlining  And I have a Yankee hat on  In Boston  In Boston  Not too smart  He did good, though  The whole tour was good  But one of the strippers  Was like this  Don't worry  She said something to me  And I went like this to her  On the stage  I flipped the bird at her  And then I tried to get some  Later on  Yeah, the strippers  Were digging on you  Yeah, I tried to reinvent myself  Like that  You know, from 
[02:04:00]  From the venue  To the after party  I tried to reinvent my  But I didn't have the tools  Yeah  From flip another bird  You were going to turn it around  Yeah  But now that you're  A big TV star again  Are you going to be doing  Our ONA traveling virus  Next summer  All the time  All right  I told you guys, man  Whenever you invite me out  I'm there  And I'm bringing my A-game  You brought your A-game  Last time  Yeah  You guys put me in front  Of 27,000 people, dude  Yeah  That's heavy duty  For a comedian  For a stand-up  For a lot of us  That's the biggest thing  We're going to do  In our careers  On now, though 
[02:04:30]  Come on  Hit show  But I love it  Huh?  You hear from anybody  From SNL  Going, dude  Can you get me on?  Who, me?  Get me on, yeah  Dude, can you get me on, man?  Just give me a guest  Talk to people  Talk to people, man  You know  You got to talk to people  You got to show me something  Get me on, man  So the guards  I need a vanilla envelope  You know  Vanilla envelope  I need an envelope  For cash  Yeah, right on  We're  I got a  Vanilla envelope  We're running out of show, right?  Well, we're running out of show 
[02:05:00]  We're beyond pissed, Tracy  We're in a horrible mood  Apologies to Army of Anyone  I'm feeling this energy  I'll tell you what happened  I'll tell you what happened, Tracy  We were having an unbelievable show today  Right  And then we were going to  Like, we were going to  You know, kick it into overdrive  With Army of Anyone  That's Richard Patrick over there  We were psyched to have the band in  Playing songs for us  Yeah, I mean  He sang lead for Filter  And then you got the boys  From Stone Temple Pilots  And they were going to do some new stuff  And then they were going to do some Filter  And then maybe some STP  We were really excited to have them 
[02:05:30]  And all of a sudden  They start playing  And it was just a cluster F  We can't hear them  That I've never seen before  I've been doing radio since I was 18  This is the worst live performance ever  And it has nothing to do with you, Richard Patrick  It's not the band's fault  It wasn't the music  It was the way it was coming through  We weren't hearing it  The board wasn't working properly  Right, so we just watched our whole show crumble in front of us  And then we see you over there  And we were excited to see you today as well, Tracy  We have this killer live, semi-live, kind of like  Well, it's live, but it's semi-acoustic 
[02:06:00]  And it's like all killer  And it involves two inputs for you  And those inputs weren't routed properly  Right, so you got the band  But we've got a lot of performances on disc  If you guys want some from other stations around the country  Great  We could play the iPod of, like, Philly's performance  Exactly  That's what you got to do  Get other stations' performances 
[02:06:30]  So basically, Richard's calling us a bunch of dopes today  As you should be  I know, I'm not pointing fingers  You should, though  It's been a success everywhere else  I say you do point fingers  Exactly  Point fingers  But I do  We do appreciate  Somebody's getting a pink slip, huh?

[02:22:00]  Tracy was horrifying some people in the elevator.  Yeah.  I'm waking a living dead.  You were trying to pick up some women in the elevator.  Oh, and I'm aggressive with it, too.  You're a star.  Aggressive.  Oh, he is so aggressive.  Well, you know, it's an elevator.  How many floors you got to work with?  Yo, my dick got so hard in that elevator.  Oh, yeah, she linked on me.  You know, it's like the subway station.  We be fighting for that door spot.  Some guys.  We fight for that door spot.  If I get a cheap drill, I'm going to get it. 
[02:22:30]  Some guys are crazy forever.  I ain't got to go to schools and Sue's rendezvous.  That stuff is illegal now, though.  Let me tell you something.  They're on to that now.  I'm in a bad mood.  I'm in a bad mood.  I am in a bad mood.  But my wife refused to give me some pussy last night.  Why?  What happened?  We fought all day in that bed.  I said something out of the line.  You know how women get sensitive?  You say the wrong thing, and they want to shut down the gates for like two months.  What did you say?  I was trying to pull a panty to the side and everything.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm saying.  I don't know.  You go in the doghouse for two months at a time?  I've been in the doghouse for two months, brother. 
[02:23:00]  Yo, they would be glad I'm not a kid.  I'm a criminal court judge.  Somebody get life today, God damn it.  Somebody get life.  Some people are so stupid and think they need like all night to pick up a chick.  Tracy, in the elevator, before it went from the lobby to the first floor, he's already  like working this one chick in the elevator, talking about how he goes, yeah, me and you.  Forbidden love.  Some white chick.  Forbidden love.  Did they see us walking down the street?  And I'm looking at the elevator going, we haven't even gone a floor and a half yet. 
[02:23:30]  And Tracy's working this chick.  But as soon as she said, no, I'm married, he went right into, my wife wouldn't give  me any pussy last night and walked off the elevator.  And then he looks at some Asian girl and just goes, she hate me.  That Asian chick didn't want any.  That's one thing I never had.  I never had an Asian chick.  I heard that cootie cat go sideways.  Go sideways.  She wanted to throw a pointy hat in a little carpet.  That Asian pussy is no joke.  You know what Yoko Ono did to the Beatles?  We all know.  Yoko Ono broke up the fucking band.  With that pussy, right?  With that pussy, that sweet pussy. 
[02:24:00]  She broke up the band.  She had John Lennon saying, Ringo who?  Paul what?  Fuck rehearsal.  And she owns all that shit, man.  I'm going to lay up with this broad.  You know Yoko Ono's still getting hate mail from baby boomers?  Yeah.  To this day.  To this very day.  She fucked it up.  Yo, let me tell you what I did on a plane, yo.  This chick was breastfeeding her baby in front of me.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I must have beat my dick about six times in that little airplane bathroom.  You got this? 
[02:24:30]  And I put some sperm on the doorknob because this fine-ass chick was waiting in line behind me.  So I beat my dick and put sperm on the doorknob.  Was that like a handjob?  Then when I came out, she walked past me.  When I was sitting there, she gave me the evil eye because she had touched my sperm.  She had put a fucking hand in my sperm.  She knew it was me.  Handjob by proxy.  She fucking knew it was me.  I'm a dirtbag, man.  Goddamn, I'm never touching the fucking dirtbag. 
[02:25:00]  She's got the dark brown nipples, the dark brown everywhere.  Yeah, those are the best kind.  Tracy's proud that he's a dirtbag, too.  You like dark brown butthole.  You said you love dark brown butthole.  I like a dark brown asshole.  I'm talking about a deep, dark, not dirty, but just a deep, dark skin.  Oh, so you get mad when they bleach it, right?  No bleaching.  I want a deep, dark asshole.  Yo, this chick came in my mouth last night.  Yeah?  Chick came in my mouth.  I had that G-spot fluid.  You know that G-spot fluid?  Oh, G-spot fluid.  I love that G-spot, leave a puddle in the bed. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  That's some hardcore.  We stink up the room.  That room was stinking.  Tracy's bringing us back.  That room was sick because I went in the kitchen and it smelled like food.  Then I went back in the oven.  Oh, it smelled like B-dussy.  Butthole, pussy, and balls, B-dussy.  B-dussy.  That was B-dussy.  It smelled like B-dussy, Marlboro Lights, Right Guard, and Doubleman.  You ever spend a lot of time, like days in a hotel room and not let room service come in  and you're just in there and all you do is fuck the entire time. 
[02:26:00]  It smelled like beat off in socks.  You just fuck the entire time.  It smelled like bus off in socks.  And you wonder.  Buss off like my son's room.  All he do is beat his dick and stay in his room.  All he do is beat his dick and his room smell like socks and bus off.  Because I got three sons and my wife, she's in the house with all guys.  And so I'm the only one in the house allowed to wear my drawers and my boxers.  You don't play that shit.  My wife be telling my son, she threatened him, motherfucker.

Unconditional love.  And he come out and it's that game.  And everybody in the polls, the post, the daily news, everybody had Christ the King not rated.  And they wasn't supposed to make state AA.  And he got them there to state AA championship. 
[02:31:30]  And before they left, to go play Monroe High School, he did not give them no speech over there.  He gave them a speech at their locker room.  And he said, let me tell you something.  I'm the coach of this football team.  Nobody said we was going to be good.  They said our defensive line was too small.  They said our linebackers wasn't fast enough.  And they said our QB. 
[02:32:00]  Dammit, they said our QB wasn't good.  Carlos, you took this team, goddammit.  You're a leader.  And you got us the state AA championship.  Now, I'm not going to get over there 10 miles to Monroe High School and give no damn speech.  Coach, you hear me?  Coach, close that door back there.  Everybody come on in and take a knee.  Come in and take a knee, goddammit. 
[02:32:30]  Now, I'm talking.  All five of you kids are like my kids, okay?  Especially you seniors.  You played four years for Coach Griff.  You're like my child.  Some of y'all are going to Purdue.  Some of y'all might even go to Kansas State.  Some of y'all, a lot of y'all ain't going to be shit.  And I love you anyway.  And I'm not going to wait.  If you don't think we can win, 
[02:33:00]  don't get on that goddamn bus.  Do not get on that goddamn bus  if you don't think we can win.  Now, are you ready?  Are you ready?  Yeah, you're ready.  Hold on.  Coach got something else to tell you.  I wasn't going to say this until now.  Coach got cancer in the balls. 
[02:33:30]  That's high school football, man.  Yeah, you got to get them pumped.  It's not like high school.  You got to get them pumped.  Anyway, you can.  They're going to kill somebody out there.  Somebody's going to get killed out there  because Coach got cancer in his balls.  This bit went on for like 20 minutes, Mike State.  Tell me that ain't a brilliant speech.  Vince Lombardi could not do better than that.  High school football coach, yeah.  Hey, Keith from Connecticut.  His wife and he, they role play too there, Tracy.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:34:00]  How you doing this morning?  Hey.  What's y'all playing, Keith?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm just talking about you guys talking about role playing with the old lady.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me and my wife, we used to do that all the time.  Actually, we still do.  Like every now and then I have to come in and like, you know,  she'd be like, like you said before, the little Girl Scout,  and I'd be like a Boy Scout troop leader.  Yeah.  One time she had me come in, and in the middle of everything,  she said, I want you to treat me like a big black man 
[02:34:30]  and do it to me good the way she does it.  So what I did is I beat her ass, and I stole her television  and ran out on her.  Sir.  Fucking half, man.  That was a long way to come to that.  That shit I care about.  That had to know is coming.  Come on, dude.  You can give me the car crash now.  No.  No, you can't top Michael Richardson, man.  That's right.  Michael Richardson.  Hey, we got...  I have a funny game.  I used to role play too with my girlfriend.  We'd play like, okay, I'm intruder, 
[02:35:00]  and you're the 80-year-old woman.  So I'd put a diaper on her, and she'd shit into it,  and then I would just fuck her mouth and smother her with a pillow.  That sounds fun.  Beat that role playing.  That sounds fun.  Beat that.  It sounds like a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Just watch her glazed over eyes and her bent nose when you take the pillow off.  She got doodle in her pamphlet.  Fucking corn and collard greens and cabbage in it.  Hey, we got the audio of Tracy in the elevator. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, beautiful.  Oh.  Tracy Morgan in the elevator.  Let's check it out.  This right here is forbidden love.  It's forbidden love.  If me and you was together, people seeing us walking down the street,  they go, how the fuck that happened?  Well, I'm married, too.  Wow, and that's even better.  What happened?  That's even better.  That's hot.  Say how that happened.  Ain't nothing like a hot woman, man, that's married.  Desperate housewives.  I love a desperate woman.  She hate me. 
[02:36:00]  She's serious.  She's done serious, too.  She's probably somebody's supervisor.  My wife would not give me no sex last night, man.  We'd go all night in that bed.  They'd be glad I'm not a criminal court judge.  Somebody get light.  Somebody get light.  My wife may give me a pussy last night.  Somebody get light.  That's in an elevator with complete strangers.  No one would look at them.  No one would look at them.  No one would look at them.  Horrified. 
[02:36:30]  Horrifying people.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, fantastic.  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, man.  Last time I was listening to the show when Tracy was on, it was before Halloween.  He said for Halloween he was going to dress his wife up as a baby,  and he was going to be the rectal thermometer.  I was wondering if he was going to do that.  Huh?  Ah.  Yeah, that was awesome.  Hey, man.  Love 30 Rock.  Y'all take it easy, guys.  Thank you, bro.  Tracy kills on 30 Rock.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up? 
[02:37:00]  Hey, what's up?  Big time fan of Tracy.  Back in the day, Uptown Comedy Club.  Wow.  Hey, Pat.  Yo, how do you feel about that Yo Mama show?  Bite off you guys.  Remember you guys used to do snaps?  Yeah, no doubt, man.  That's corny, man.  That's corny, man.  I don't know, man.  You know, I don't watch that, man.  I don't watch that.  Nah.  It's weak.  It's weak.  You guys are so much funnier.  How you going to make a show called Yo Mama?  Come on.  And not really take it to the limit.  Yeah.  Come on.  You know?  You've got to be able to put it on fucking... 
[02:37:30]  But we need that.  We need the kiddie stuff.  You know?  We've got to have that.  That's for the kids.  You know, it's like...  Fuck the kids.  You know, but it's for the baby stuff.  I mean, literally.  Yeah.  It's for the baby.  That's right.  They, you know, if they want it, they should have put it on HBO or something.  Yeah, yeah.  We could really get down, you know, your mama's cunt.  Yeah, you can't just say your mama.  Come on.  You got to...  If you're snapping, you got to be able to say motherfucker.  Yeah, really get down and dirty.  That show is awful.  Your mom's got a titty. 
[02:38:00]  Your mom's got a glass titty with Kool-Aid in it.  Your mother's breath smell like cheese doodles.  Light on a cheese and heavy on a doodle.  Your mom's got one toe and one knee and they call her Tony.  Your mom's got one big tooth you eat now, ladies.  What?  What?  Your mom's got one arm longer than the other and clap like this.  I'll blow all the motherfuckers away, man. 
[02:38:30]  I still carry bullets to my gun.  Let's go to Scott in Boston.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Scott, hey, what's up?  Hey, Chasey.  What?  What's up?  My girlfriend's still horrified by you.  Good.  Backstage at the Traveling Virus.  She should be.  I'm the big bad wolf.  What happened at the Traveling Virus show?  Oh, he was picking on her backstage after and she chokes on my dick.  Yeah.  She got a gag.  That's a good girl.  If you don't gag, we're not going to P.C.  Richard's.  You want that TV set? 
[02:39:00]  Let's get some mascara running.  I want to see the long spit chain.  I'm a prick, dude.  I like when women throw up on my dick.  What you have for dinner?  What you have for lunch today?  Corned beef hairs.  Yeah, I like that.  Yeah, she's still horrified.  Is that your phone?  Thanks, Tracy.  What do you got playing on that?  What's your ringtone?  What is that?  Did I leave your mind when I... 
[02:39:30]  That's what Michael was.  Yeah.  Yo, man, let me tell you something, man.  If it was me, I'd be bragging.  If Michael Jackson gave me head, I'd be bragging about that shit.  Yeah, well, apparently that seemed to be the problem.  Yes, it happened twice.  Once by the teacups, and once by the giraffe cage.  Jermaine was watching.  Once by the giraffe cage.  I stuck my finger in...  Yo, let me tell you something, man.  I'm a freak, man.  I'm a weedy-beedy bing-bong freak.  I let my wife put her finger in my ass, but just don't go past the knuckle. 
[02:40:00]  As soon as I feel knuckles, I'm punching somebody in the eyes.  As soon as I feel the knuckle.  First knuckle or second knuckle?  No.  Punching someone in the eye.  This big knuckle.  I bet I feel the knuckle.  The big, like the middle knuckle.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you got the first one.  That's my shit now, though, man.  Yeah?  I love to put my dick in a chick's ass.  What?  Ass fucking?  Yeah.  That way you're at.  I do it with no remorse.  When I take my dick out, I'm working looking like this.  I just give her the pink sock, god damn it. 
[02:40:30]  Pink sock.  Give her the pink sock.  Oh, when you pull the cock out and the asshole skin comes with it?  Yeah.  Pink sock.  You kind of turn some intestine inside out.  No remorse, god damn it.  I'm your best boyfriend, god damn it.  I'm not your first, but I'm your best.  Women be trying to hold on to the asshole, though.  They be trying to hold on.  That's for the honeymoon.  They call that the honeymoon hole.  Only on the honeymoon.  These days, that's virginity for the marriage.  Yeah.  That's saving yourself a marriage.  It's saving the ass.  Tracy, I got to ask you something.  Someone is bringing it up, and it has come. 
[02:41:00]  People have been asking this for a while now.  What was that?  Why did you leave the Super Bowl competition?  What was that?  Remember when you were?  We gave you a bee suit and everything.  No.  I wouldn't.  No.  I couldn't.  I couldn't.  No.  It was guys putting their fucking balls in a container with killer bees.  I remember that.  I can't top that.  I remember Tracy.  I said to myself, I'll be back, and I'll see my fam later.  All right.  Can I tell you something?  I can't top that.  Let me tell you where I sit.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  What was the other thing that God was getting shocked? 
[02:41:30]  Mousetraps.  Yeah.  Mousetraps on their balls.  Mousetraps.  Bees in the studio.  Guys putting their penises in jars filled with bees.  I couldn't top that.  Seeing who could get stung the first time.  I couldn't top that.  That was rough.  Let me explain something to you.  I couldn't top that.  Tracy, let me explain something to you.  To us, we're so happy we have you as a friend.  Like, man, we got a cool friend, man.  Yeah.  And I was just hoping you didn't run out of here because you thought we were doing, like,  hack radio or something.  No.  I didn't feel that way, man.  I've never been around.  I've never seen nothing like that.  All right, you were just, like, all freaked out?  No, yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Because we gave you a bee suit and everything, and you looked great in a bee suit.  How's out, dude?  We were all sitting in stupid fucking bee suits.  To me, you guys are the best.  I love doing radio with you guys, man.  Yeah.  You know, it's honest, it's open, and I love it, man.  No way.  No way in the world.  Because you ran out and were like, ah, man, that's a bummer.  No, don't ever worry about that stuff, man.  You guys came down to SNL.  I mean, not to SNL to Caroline's, and you hollered at me.  Absolutely.  No way.  Yeah, I don't think, my mind don't pop like that.  I know I'm coming back.  I know I'm coming back to hang out with you guys. 
[02:42:30]  All right, last time I saw you at Caroline's, you were showing off your pubic hair.  Yeah.  To the girls in the front row.  Why don't you shave it?  I'm surprised you don't shave, man.  I shave all of it.  Chick asked me to go bald last night, but you know, that's my whole shit right there.  Shave all of it.  I love it.  Chicks love to suck your dick.  I just don't have the time.  You know, get down there and go work there.  You do any, like, grooming down there?  Nah, I don't know.  Just let it fly?  He's nappy and all that.  I got the nappy dugout with that, man.  Make it look like it.  I'm a grown-ass man, you know?  Make it look like an ABA basketball player down there?  I'm not with them.  You could keep things in order, but unless you, you know, if you try too hard, then it 
[02:43:00]  really kind of looks bad.  Come on, man.  Women love the way balls and dick and all that shit smell, man.  They do, but it's shame.  I go play a few games of basketball and then come home and throw it up in my face.  My package.  Someone has a story for you there, Tracy.  What's up, bro?  Joe in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I got a story that Tracy reminded me of when he put the cum on the doorknob in the men's  room, you know, in the bathroom with the airplane.  You freak like me out.  Yeah, I used to be a super in the projects, and I was trying to get some play from this 
[02:43:30]  honey, a little Puerto Rican broad, but she wasn't giving me no play.  So, when I was in the bathroom, I beat it into her lipstick.  Yeah.  You know, you rolled a lipstick down.  You're my fucking hero, man.  Oh, God.  You are my fucking hero.  I fucking knew it.  And I put it back up on the shelf.  Yes.  Take that.  She signed my work order.  She said, okay, I'm done.  Goodbye.  And I got food.  Take that.  Keep it moving.  You won.  You won.  You won.  You won.  You won.  Yo, check it out. 
[02:44:00]  This is the noise that I make when I'm getting ready to explode.  And I go, God damn it.  You're cracking me up today, man.  You're out of your mind.  You put fucking cum on a woman's lipstick.  That's how I sound when I'm getting ready to cum.  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  When I was a teenager, I forgot about this.  My friend Dean, I was probably like 13, and my friend Neil was 13, and Dean was like 15. 
[02:44:30]  Dean went in the bathroom and jerked off, and we didn't know what he did.  And he came out of the bathroom, and he wiped it on my glasses.  It didn't touch my skin.  It pulled up in my glasses.  Holy shit.  And then he wiped it on Neil's mouth.  He goes, you've been giving head.  And then he wiped it on Neil's lips.  Oh, my God.  I forgot about that.  I would have probably still been doing time.  I might have just been seeing the parole boards.  You just thought about that?  I forgot about it.  Yeah.  How do you forget about it?  That's how, yo, let me tell you how low. 
[02:45:00]  That's why I don't want to let nobody in my house.  Yeah.  Because everybody smells.  Oh, great crash.  Yeah.  Pursuit crash.  I don't want nobody else smelling my wife's ass but me.  Because I know how low I can get.  I used to have this buddy when I was young.  I was about 17, right?  Right.  So I'm 17, but this is my best friend.  When you saw him, you saw me.  When you saw me, you saw him.  You know, you hang out.  You spend the night at your boy's crib and everything.  And he had a hot mom's.  His mom's are so hot.  But I'm a teenager, goddammit.  I'm not your son. 
[02:45:30]  She treated me like she loved me like I was a son.  So she felt comfortable enough to walk around in her panties and her bra around me.  Uh-oh.  She used to go in his bathroom and go in the hamper and get them panties out and literally  search for the booty hole part.  Oh, my God.  I was sticking my panties together for years and she never knew.  And you'd put that where her asshole was.  You'd put that right on your nose and smell as you jerked off.  I love discharge, man.  I love when a woman gets that discharge. 
[02:46:00]  I love that discharge.  I love trying to source on my fish.  That image of you just jacking off, smelling fucking dirty panties.  I'm making, I'm mesquiteing right all in her panties.  Yeah.  I love when a discharge dries in her panties and it get crunchy.  I'll put that shit in my salad.  Fuck who's on.  Oh, God damn.  I love dry discharge.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve says he grew up with Tracy in the Bronx.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, what up, Trace?  What up, Steve?  Hey, now, baby.  How you doing?  Holler at me when you see me on the streets act like you know me.  You know I love you, baby.  No doubt.  How you doing your thing?  Congratulations.  Right on, baby.  I love the radio station.  You guys are doing a great job.  Thank you.  They're the best, right?  Thanks, man.  You got a story about Tracy or something, or you just want to say hi?  No, I just want to say what up.  That's my boy.  He's always doing his thing.  He told me he's going to make it, and he made it to Saturday Night Live, and he made movies.  He did his thing.  The boy is very positive.  My man.  Thank you. 
[02:47:00]  I love how Tracy turns up in movies sometimes.  Like, you'd just be watching a fucking movie, and it's like, oh, there's Tracy with some  lipstick and a skirt on or some shit.  No, no, man.  Let me tell you something, man.  When I did Longest Shot, man, that was thought out methodically.  Yeah.  In order for your career to move a notch in show business, you have to have some oh shit  moments.  People got to leave and go, oh shit.  Can they look for you again?  Yeah.  So, that was one of my oh shit moments, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:47:30]  I had a fucking camel toe.  I had a camel toe.  Yeah, you certainly did.  They gave me some good money, but I got to work with.  I was in a movie with Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, all these motherfucking celebrity  icons, Hall of Famers.  Yeah.  So, I had to have a certain part in the movie, so I said, I want that part.  Give me that part.  And it was good.  Yeah.  And I well, yeah.  And then you just pop up like, you know, you're watching a movie and it's like. 
[02:48:00]  Totally awesome.  Out of nowhere, you hear, you know, that voice and you go, oh fuck, here comes Tracy.  What is he?  All right, he's a drug dealer in this one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking Jay and Silent Bob.  Yeah, I love that, man.  Yeah.  I don't know what the fuck you just said, little kid.  Yeah.  Just moving backwards.  If you were on the same plane as Tracy and you went to the bathroom after him and you  got some of his sperm on your head.  You better get some rubber gloves.  Oh, dude.  Well, he doesn't like gooey things, Tracy. 
[02:48:30]  We think he's a germaphobe, but it's more like he's just not a gooey shit.  I'm not a germaphobe.  I'm a disgusting-a-phobe.  Like, I just don't like, like, what would gooey shit in the bathroom?  Oh, she was hot.  She was hot and she looked it down upon me.  And take us through it.  Yeah.  She looked it down upon me and I seen it.  What if, what if, like, she would have left to go back to her seat and some big fat guy  would have gotten in line and he's there with fucking-  He's fucked.  Tracy Morgan come on his hand.  He's even better.  He's fucked.  As he's digging into his fucking fresh cookies they just handed out. 
[02:49:00]  You mean, what's his name, Valanche?  You know we're starting a new chain of restaurants and strip clubs together.  Yeah.  And my boy Bradley, yeah.  It's, um, it's gonna be a strip club for old, fat, lonely women.  And, um, it's gonna be, we're gonna serve chicken.  So it's gonna be called Chickendales.  Chicken and slaw.  Chicken and coleslaw.  We got a Bruce Valanche opening up in Bismarck the first week.  So we got the stripping for fat, lonely chicks, old, fat, lonely chicks. 
[02:49:30]  This is called Chickendales.  I would-  Oh yeah, getting back.  I would-  We got Eva Kniewa's father doing it too.  He's gonna be in a wheelchair stripping.  And plus we're gonna make him jump four phone books.  And a souped up scooter.  That's why I don't touch shit in bathrooms.  You gotta be careful.  I do, I wash the hands, I dry them with a paper towel, and then I use the paper towel to open the door.  And if the garbage is by the fucking door, good, I'll use the garbage.  If it's not, I throw it on the fucking floor. 
[02:50:00]  Dude, she looked at me like she wanted to kill me.  And we showed you 5,000 feet in the air.  Where are you going, honey?  You leaving?  I had my headphones on like this.  How did she touch my sperm?  You both can't leave.  Both kind of stuck.  All right, hey, is he drunk enough now?  Yeah, he's about five beers in.  Oh yeah, okay.  You wanna get a song from him before we take a break?  Yeah, I wanna hear what this guy plays like.  This is the homeless guitar dude.  We're gonna take him on the homeless shopping spree? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, I think so.  On December 16th, I guess?  Is that when it is?  And then, um...  That dude smelled like brew, like a brewery.  Oh yeah.  He's been pounded.  What is he drinking?  What are those bottles?  He's drinking some kind of red and fucking...  What is he drinking?  That's those new aluminum Budweiser's.  Are they?  Oh, that's a pretty bottle.  I'd like to lay it over someone's head.  That's a new...  That's the new Budweiser's?  Yeah, yeah.  They come in aluminum bottles.  Aluminum?  Really? 
[02:51:00]  What the fuck are they doing putting out aluminum bottles?  That would hurt.  Those come in four packs, right?  Yeah, four packs.  A full one of those laid over someone's head.  Worse than a full glass bottle?  No, it's really light.  Yeah, it's light.  Is it?  Yeah?  Yeah, real light.  Okay.  Yo, fellas, when are we going back on tour, man?  Next summer, bro.  Wow, summer.  Huh?  We got a winter of fucking...  Don't forget me, dude.  ...roaming the country, going to radio stations.  We're going to expand.  I love those gigs, man, because it'd be rock and roll, and the sun be setting, and people  way up there, and chilling, and... 
[02:51:30]  It was a great time.  It was like a rocket time, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like being backstage at a rock show.  I know a million comedians that have never experienced that.  Yeah?  Never.  That was a lot of fun, man.  So that was an honor, just to be there with the people on the stairs.  Hey, don't bash Yakov.  What?  Yakov Shmiernoff?  What about Yakov?  He's going to make a comeback.  You wait and see.  That's a different animal, too, doing crowds that size.  It's much different than a regular comedy club.  You don't know.  Fucking vibe is different.  What's the dude that bombed?  Jimmy Schubert.  You got to take your time when you get out there, man.  You got to make a connection, man. 
[02:52:00]  That's a lot of people out there.  He just didn't care.  You know?  I was like, damn.  Yeah, that was rough.  Make a connection, man.  You got to make a connection.  That was a little rough.  Say what's up.  Say hello.  How you doing?  He went right into his head.  Yeah, right into the shit, man.  Hey, his family was there.  He's from Philly.  Did he have to do an interview after that?  I was like, dude.  I just set a rules when you go up in front of a stadium crowd.  Because we used to do it to intro bands.  And that was it.  You know?  Back in the old days.  We used to have to get in front of huge amounts of people and intro a band. 
[02:52:30]  Hey, we're Opie and Anthony.  Blah, blah, blah.  And the three rules.  You go out there.  You say, how the fuck we doing?  You got to curse.  Yeah.  You got to ask them how you're doing.  Yeah.  And curse.  Now they're fucking psyched for you.  Psyched for you.  Mention the city you're in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let me hear it.  Enter city name here.  Well, because they'll always cheer for their fucking city.  And then if they're a fucking, like, motherfucker sports team city, mention the fucking team, 
[02:53:00]  something like that.  You're going to get another big thing.  See, I don't believe in that.  That's all we needed to do.  I think you go out there.  You say, your evening enjoyable thus far?  And they give you a nice and blue.  Tracy doesn't believe in that shit either.  Because like you said earlier, in Boston, he's wearing the Yankee cap.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't care about that.  Yeah, I was an idiot.  I was trying to be cool.  Tracy smells good.  I know.  Really good.  What is that?  Thank God.  It smells rich.  I'm going to do whatever I got to do to get the edge.  Tracy smells rich.  I'm going to do whatever I got to do to get the edge, brother. 
[02:53:30]  Now, is that regular curve or no?  Regular curve.  So, throw it on.  Chick, smell it.  I'm going to go buy something.  Get close to them.  Your curve is, yeah.  They want to get up on you.  Let's get the homeless guy in here.  He's all...  Do you use the spray or the hand stuff?  Just the spray.  Okay.  Homeless dude.  Yeah, Tracy with the curve on and the homeless guy put together like matter, anti-matter with  the smells.  Hopefully, it just...  Master Poe was out there, bro.  Cancels it out.  Oh, yeah.  Master Poe.  He held me down one time at Caroline's and this dude was heckling.  Rather, his girl was drunk and she was heckling. 
[02:54:00]  And Master Poe walked up to him because I said, you know, tell your girl to shut the  fuck up.  What if I ask is something?  And Master Poe walked up and said, hey, could you keep it down?  And I told the whole crowd, uh-oh, he's getting very happy.  I want to see what Master Poe got.  Fuck that.  Let's watch this fight.  He either fucking busted some head.  Yeah.  This is homeless guitar dude there, Tracy.  He's shaking a little.  Why are you shaking?  Get him a wireless mic, please, or he's just a little nervous. 
[02:54:30]  Cranking.  Yeah.  Now you're feeling better?  I will rock and I like every inch of it.  Wow.  See, he's a little different now.  After a few beers, you feel a little better?  Listens anyone up.  That's nice to say.  Never, never listen to him.  Hey, everybody out there is getting ready to happen in here.  You heard what you said?  Yeah.  He's got a battery going into his, uh, he's got a little lamp.  He's got a whole studio.  He's got a little friggin' amp and some, uh, pedals on his belt.  That's him. 
[02:55:00]  He's getting ready.  Sean's helping.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Just leave your sperm on the doorknob on the way out there.  Wow.  That's all we ask.  Sounds like a dust buster.  Do we have a mic or the stand?  Uh, no.  No.  I don't know.  All right.  This is drunk rock.  Drunk rock.  Drunk rock.  Not drunk rock.  This is drunk rock. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, come on.  Uh-oh.  What happened with your amp?  What happened?  Just like a woman.  Never works when you want her to.  Yeah.  Well, punch it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Your amp is a cunt.  This is worse than what you've got.  Here he goes.  All right.  Here he goes.  Oh.  You got the worst equipment.  Tracy, this has been happening all morning.  He has one D battery and it keeps going out.  Yeah.  You got worse equipment than free FM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Steve, why am I homeless?  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  About to get into it.  The battery.  Yeah.  The battery.  No, it's a short.  He's got a short.  All right.  Here we go.  Look. 
[02:56:30]  Look.  What happened?  Yeah.  You got some electrical tape in here?  Wait.  What happened?  You unplugged yourself.  He's going to electrocute himself.  Look at all that equipment around him.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Oh, perfect.  I think he's got a car battery around his waist.  What is that?  You got a short.  No, I got a long.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Just leave it like it is when it works.  Come on, God.  He's punching it.  He's paying a lot of money for these chickens.  Wow.  Yeah, we did pay a lot of money for this.  Randy sleeps on the roads. 
[02:57:00]  It's more like alcohol and leather.  Alcohol and leather.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  He's off.  Pete pounds burden.  Hey, big doodles, Jay, from Jersey. 
[02:57:30]  Randy sleeps in the roads.  That's what Jimmy just said.  Oh, I'm not in here.  I'm sorry.  I was trying to rip you off.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Isn't that awful? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, what happened?  Oh.  Oh.  That is horrific.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I can listen to this all day. 
[02:58:30]  This is so fucking funny.  Wait, what happened?  He's punching his amp again.  What?  He's punching it.  All right.  We're back on.  I think we've got something here. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, God damn, that feedback is killing my ears.  I can't even wear my headphones.  You are Eric Crapton.  You need a manager?  Master Cole, man, you can manage him.  You should manage him.  You can put him on the road.  Wait, I think he might be ready to sing. 
[02:59:30]  Don't show up for me, man.  I'm telling you.  Don't vomit on him, man.  That's the end of that pit.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh, what happened?  What the?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, here he goes. 
[03:00:00]  All right, he's back.  I can listen to this for another hour.  His five-year-old threw himself out the window.  The battery.  He can't stop fucking with everything.  He fucks with everything.  It's just turning the guitar off.  Yeah.  Oh, is he bad?  What happened?  You are good.  Six double A on his nose.  Wait, what happened?  He smells.  He's Angus Dunn.  We've got to get him six double A batteries.  Double A.  Double A. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, it's what my wife used to say.  Chuck buried in a week.  This is not right.  Wow.  This is a dark day in rock and roll, man.  Dark day.  Oh.  This is a dark day.  Who cares?  Who cares?  He's messing with his stuff.  Look.  That's his rig.  That's his rig. 
[03:01:00]  That's the only thing I got.  Do you sing, too?  You sing?  No.  I'll leave that up to the singer.  The singer don't play guitar, and I don't sing.  Fair enough.  You ain't playing guitar either.  His battery's rare now, brother.  The feedback is really amazing.  There he goes.  Now he's ready.  All right.  Now he's ready.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rock.  Hey, I'm going to sing.  I'll sing. 
[03:01:30]  I'm going to sing, okay?  Where's your wah-wah?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Where's the wah-wah?  Oh, crap.  It's out of here.  Pop, pop, pop.  This is so fucking funny.  Is that good equipment?  Yeah.  Well, the battery's working here.  Hey, did we do George Thoroughbred?  I want to get a drink.  That's meat sick.  I can't take questions.  I want to make some room. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy's horrendous.  I want to get a drink.  That's plenty of crab shit.  That's the guitar solo from Beatty.  Yeah, please.  There he goes.  He's trying to push another button, so.  Dig, if you will, the picture.  What is...  With you and I again. 
[03:02:30]  What is he playing?  I don't know.  That's Purple Rain.  Oh, is it?  With the dumps drive.  Oh, yeah.  With the dumps drive.  Britt.  Richie's damn boring.  Jimmy Plague.  There we go, dude.  God damn it.  Come on.  Oh, thank God.  Right here.  For the Alice in Chains fans out there, Jerry can't play.  From Brian in Boston.  Ah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  The batteries. 
[03:03:00]  That's it.  Oh, what happened?  That's it.  The batteries.  Wait, what happened?  Batteries.  It's not the battery.  I think you got a short circuit.  Yeah, what's up?  No, it's a point when the batteries are dead, it shuts on and off.  Well, how about someone go get some batteries?  Hey, didn't you charge up for the big gig today?  Yeah.  Come on, this is the big gig, man.  This is the big time.  You got record people listening and everything.  This is what you've been waiting for.  Quincy Jones.  Quincy Jones, my son.  And this guitar don't help.  It's been through the road rush like me, man. 
[03:03:30]  I think we might have another one of those Jager Meister guitars around, too.  Is there a Jager guitar laying around?  See if we can get him a better guitar and a battery, and we'll see what he can really do.  What kind of batteries?  How many batteries do you need?  Six double A.  Wow.  Six double A.  A whole maglite full over his head.  All right.  He's running again.  There we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, now he's rocking.  Okay.  Now I understand. 
[03:04:00]  You know what's so sad?  Without the alcohol, he's probably like the greatest.  No, he's the greatest.  He's the greatest.  That's got to be the spirit of Jimi Hendrix.  Hey, Spike from Chicago wants to nickname him ZZ Stop. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, man.  This kid might get heavy.  Now we've got a new guitar coming out and a battery.  Oh, God.  Must apologize to the listening audience with these sounds.  It's been a good day for music.  Wow, you're a great day for music.  Steve from Albany for all the Rush fans out there. 
[03:05:00]  Alex Waste of Lifeson.  Snapman from Wack Bag.  Stevie Ray Yawn.  Well, she went.  Oh, he's singing.  Uh-oh.  He's going to sing.  Flying down and out to do it.  From the chain or the old fresh road.  To a crime comes to death.  With a monster to death. 
[03:05:30]  And a kid is playing victory in the state.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  The squealing.  What was it?  That was the...  What?  That's the sound of one hand clapping.  He's shaking.  What's with that squeak?  Does he have Parkinson's?  I don't know.  Why are you shaking, sir?  Oh, I'm ready to rip it.  Do you have Parkinson's?  Yeah.  I'm mad at this stuff, man.  I got a short cream.  Maybe.  All right.  You really want to...  I don't think that's going to do it. 
[03:06:00]  Take off like a...  Wait.  We got to hear his vocals, man.  He's...  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Back way off on the guitar mic.  That's the butt fuck song.  Pull the guitar mic away.  I can't read it, Charlie.  Yeah.  Pull the guitar mic away.  Yeah.  We don't know if he's there.  Yeah.  Believe me.  It picks up.  And then so we can hear him sing.  All right.  Let's hear you sing there.  Sing a little.  All right.  Sing a little song.  Do the butt fuck song.  Are you listening to me? 
[03:07:00]  I love Lenny Kravitz, man.  Lenny Kravitz kicks butt.  And you mentioned...  Oh, wow.  You just hit me there.  You mentioned it today.  Rockefeller and all that, what a today show is.  That's where I got my blanket and everything.  Right across the way, I saw Lenny Kravitz.  Oh, you did?  He kicks butt like a mother.  Yeah.  You know a little Lenny?  Can you sing it?  Can you sing and play a little?  I can't sing anything. 
[03:07:30]  Well, you sang the butt fuck song.  Sing that again.  That was pretty good.  What?  Which one?  Who?  You were just singing just about a minute ago.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  What happened here?  Crank it up.  What's wrong with your equipment?  I turned it off.  Oh, you're sweet.  This guitar has got a short in it.  Yeah.  This is true.  Wow.  It's not...  From Jimbo from North Carolina.  Johnny Neath Cash.  Come on.  Lift it up.  Where's Mark David Chapman when you need him? 
[03:08:00]  Johnny Neath Cash.  Yeah, see?  The inside wiring.  Hey, you ever been in a band?  How many bands have been in?  Well, we got Ace from Houston.  This guy's name is Johnny Please Die This Winter.  Are you finished?  Derek in Ohio when he craps his pants.  See, it's out of tune, man. 
[03:08:30]  This thing gets out of tune.  All right, let's go.  Here we go.  You're back in tune.  This one goes out to the one I fuck.  This one goes out to the one I left her behind. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, I forgot that one.  It's out of mercy, mess.  Back from scratch.  Yeah, the mess part.  Someone from their cell phone.  Tommy, out of tune.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Neil Old.  All those cells.  Get the shit out of it. 
[03:09:30]  Neil Mulder.  You went with Neil Old?  Neil Old.  Yeah.  See?  Six double A batteries.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  For the REM fans, Josh and Jersey, Peter needs a buck. 
[03:10:00]  That's good.  This guy's terrific.  We can hear this.  We couldn't hear fucking, you know, filter.  Where's Lucille?  What's happening?  Homeless guitar dude.  What's happening?  What's happening?  What's up, guitar dude?  Batteries.  Oh, damn batteries again. 
[03:10:30]  Why can't we get him batteries?  Jump guitar dude in a six-step.  Who's on their way out?  Is someone getting him batteries?  Yeah, batteries are on the way.  They're en route.  They're in who?  Ah, yeah, roof.  That's a wrap.  That's great.  I got a pill.  Oh, God.  I hate that when my equipment fails.  Yeah, I bet.  How do you think it feels about you?  What?  Remember the band when they were on?  Equipment failed.  Yeah, see? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, but they're millionaires.  Happens to everyone.  Yeah, it happens to everyone.  That's the one common link.  You have a common link with that band.  The failure of equipment.  Their equipment failed and yours is trying to kill itself.  And your liver is failing.  That's something in common.  What's your name, homeless dude?  What are your names?  They call me Papa Rock.  Oh, Papa Rock.  Papa Rock.  That makes sense.  Besides an older gentleman and he rocks.  No. 
[03:11:30]  Actually, he sleeps on his 23 years old.  There's a couple of life out there on the street.  This could be over.  Arguably.  The car is fresh.  And the worst guitar playing.  I'm mesmerizing.  I've ever heard in my life.  Wow, dang.  I don't know how to get tuberculosis from this.  It is.  Bam.  The title of this video?  Getting tuberculosis from this.  Worst guitarist ever.  Wow.  Dang.  I'm telling it right now.  There you go.

[03:12:30]  Fifty-four.  Don't call me, sir.  Oh, don't call you, sir?  No, I'm homeless for a living.  Hey, that was a good one.  It's being respectful.  Yeah.  Die.  You want to warm up for Tracy Morgan at Caroline's this weekend?  I love you people.  All right, what's that?  I got my wow. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  My wow-y-dally.  Your wow sticker, yeah.  Well, how could a guitar sound like it has moving parts that aren't oil?  What's up with the guitar?  What's up?  It just got mad.  Yeah.  I bet.  Hanging right next to your cock all day.  You might be getting electrocuted.  It's got to be electrocuted.  On.  What's that noise?  That's the turbo spinning on the wheel. 
[03:13:30]  The wheel to power it.  It sounds like Chong when he was playing guitar in the next movie.  When I try to change it, you can know the battery's out.  I'll change the settings.  Don't electrocute yourself, brother.  No, please do.  That's the batteries, man.  What's the matter with you?  I hope to see him tasered by his own equipment.  Hey, what's the matter with you?  Yeah, what is the matter with you?  He's well aware, man.  Do you think all that feedback is from batteries?  That is from...  That amp has been through hell. 
[03:14:00]  That was paranoid.  Yeah, right up until...  All right, what happened?  It ended.  The batteries.  Yeah, the batteries again.  And we go again.  This guitar is homeless. 
[03:14:30]  It's never worked, man.  Get it?  See?  He's shaking like crazy.  You think it's got the...  I don't know what Park is in it.  Park is home.  Park is home.  Maybe he's just keeping in step of the beat.  Yeah, my batteries are out.  I've been cranking down without changing batteries.  Right.

[03:21:30]  What years?  Same day of the attacks.  In the Navy.  How'd you know?  I just was, you know...  You look like a Navy guy.  You look like a Navy guy.  You look like a Navy guy.  I was part of a cleanup crew.  Vietnam?  What cleanup crew?  We had an eight-man team.  Eight-man team.  We'd go out at night when we bombarded the place with rockets and all that.  You know, bunkers and all that, man.  Uh-huh.  But you were in the arms of Mekong Delta. 
[03:22:00]  Like the Navy SEALs of Mekong Delta.  Like the Navy SEALs of Mekong Delta.  He was in the Navy for three months?  Yeah, the Dragon of Nine Fingers.  Right.  Then we got off in the gunboat.  Right.  Well, not the gunboat helicopter.  Not the...  A little...  A little...  A little...  Yeah, yeah.  Type thing.  A little Zodiac.  Boom, boom.  And then you'd take that out, and then you'd hit the beaches, or you'd hit the river.  The river.  Then you'd go up the Mekong Delta into the rice paddies and chop off some gook ears. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good old days, right?  Even the kids would come up to you with a backpack full of bombs.  You gotta shoot them.  Never hug the kids.  Never pick up anything.  No, no.  Never hug the kids.  Don't even go to the bathroom when they're in there, I say.  What years were you in the Navy?  Yeah, what years were you in the Navy?  In Vietnam.  69, 70.  69, 70.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you get shot at?  Yeah.  Yeah, a couple times.  I took three tours.  Three tours in a year.  After the third tour, they pulled everybody out. 
[03:23:00]  Wait, 69 to 70, you took three tours in a year?  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We practically lived there.  Fucking liar.  What was your...  Three cores, four cores.  How long was each tour?  About two years?  No.  Oh, how long?  This was six months.  Quick, quick tours.  Quick tours.  I mean, they were bombarding.  I was on rocket launcher number three.  Number three?  Rocket launcher number seven.  Mm-hmm.  And I was a popcorn popper.  Popcorn popper.  My uncle was on number six, did you know?  Yeah, the .50 Cal.  I was on the USS White River. 
[03:23:30]  The USS White River.  Yeah, a flat-bottom boat built to go down the canals.  Oh, yeah?  After bombardment, we'd go out at night and anchor and then put down the raft, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we'd go, boom, boom.  Tiger, man.  Everybody wearing all black.  Fucking tigers.  Eight men.  Yeah.  Eight men teams, man.  It was so disgraceful.  Yeah, I want to play that guitar.

Playing your guitar?  I'd be honored, sir.  Talking about malfunctions.  Yeah.  I know how to play guitar.  This is going to malfunction.  It's Thanksgiving.

You don't feel like playing?  Why?  What's wrong, sir?  What happened?  This is garbage.  I don't like playing in garbage.  No, that's not garbage.  Nah.  I could show you what I could do.  Ope could, uh...  Okay, Ope.  He knows the little, uh... 
[03:25:30]  I believe he does.  He plays the guitar.  A little bit.  All right, Ope, please do what you can do with this thing, man.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let me, uh...  Let me strap in.  What is this?  Here.  Thanksgiving tomorrow.  Yeah, it is, isn't it?  What, you want a dick?  Oh, no, I know.  I know it's a dick.  I just...  Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.  Who cuts your hair?  Boy, okay.  All he has, don't do it.  Just, just...  Hey, two hairs cut.  That's cool.  He's cool, man.  All right, turn me on.  All right. 
[03:26:00]  Are you ready?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  I like this.  Play a little, um, uh, National Anthem, like, uh, Jimi Hendrix.  Yeah.  Do it again.  Oh, no.  Yeah, they're jamming.  That's cool.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, my God.  He's helping them.  The guy's reaching around and helping old me. 
[03:26:30]  He's teaching them.  Hey, do you know any, uh...  You know any who?  Like Pete Townsend?  What was Pete Townsend famous for?  Grab a peat toy, man.  Here, you play it first.  Show me something first.  Show me something.  What?  Just show me something.  Rainbowhead.  I don't know.  Why are we doing this?  This is going to be awful.  I know.  I'm not going to be able to look.  I can't look.  I'm looking to my hand.  I'm looking away.  The man is being so sweet.  He's helping Opie play.  He's teaching him a tune.  And he's a make-believe veteran.  Teach me a song. 
[03:27:00]  He's a fake veteran.  I don't know if he is or not.  Oh, stop it.  Rocket Launcher number three.  He's fucking crazy.  Yeah, I know, but...  Where is it?  There it is.  He toured in Vietnam in 88.  That's a pig from Papa Rock.  Oh, wow.  That's what I got.  The sticker.  Wow.  He uses the cleanest piece.  I'm going to put it on my guitar.  All right.  Throw me a song, and I'll do a little song.  Poor Papa Rock. 
[03:27:30]  Uh-oh.  I got the culprit, didn't I?  Well, what a fine time you... 
[03:28:00]  Fuck it.  Oh, no.  I like that, huh?  Oh, boy.  What?  I don't know how to play.  Should we take a break?  I gotta take a break.  Yeah, me too.  All right.  Take a break or take a leak?  After the break, we're gonna play.  After the break, Opie's gonna play a little tune.  All right.  You get a beer in ya.  You're gonna need it.  All right, we'll be back in a few minutes.  All right. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  All right.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses?  I use Wow stickers around the house to keep raccoons away from my garbage.  Come here, little fella.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ, my balls.  Ouch.  Ouch.  My balls.  My balls are being bit by a raccoon here, people.  Dude.  Raccoon eating my balls here.  Raccoon on balls. 
[03:29:00]  Anybody?  Can you see the raccoon dangling from my crotch?  Let me get you in.  Opie and Anthony.  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow stickers at opieandanthony.com.  Derek, there's something hanging off your balls, man.  All right. 
[03:29:30]  More video of Bush pardoning the turkey.  Yeah, I saw that on the TV.  It's the 59th turkey pardoning or something.  And they live in Disney?  Yeah, when they're pardoned, they live in Disneyland.  Land?  Apparently, it's where they send them.  They had little fun facts up there.  And the first presidential turkey pardon was Harry Truman. 
[03:30:00]  Just kind of funny.  Dropped two atomic bombs on two cities.  Somebody saved the turkey.  Yeah, let the turkey.  Don't fucking barbecue the turkey.  Yeah, no kidding.  Let's fucking barbecue some Japanese.  But I pardon you.  You would think they would start the tradition after he left office.  Oh, boy, here's some footage of Bobby.  Bobby, take the shortcut through the kitchen.  Yeah, why not?  Anyway.  Bobby Kennedy.  What is that, a movie that's out?  Oh, yeah.  About Bobby. 
[03:30:30]  There was a lot of hype, and then the reviews came out, and there was...  Nothing?  Nah, a couple stars.  What did they say?  It was a bad movie?  Yeah.  I heard they change it, and he doesn't get shot in this version.  Ah, well, that would make it an awful movie.  The shooter pulls a gun, and he uses karate, and he chops it, and then he wins the presidency.  And he makes gay marriage mandatory.  And everyone fucks each other in the ass.  Man, see what I heard.  Let's go to Ralph.  Ralph, what's up?  How did I get a bad review?  I don't know.  What's up, guys?  This guy who lives by the pizzeria on 48th Street. 
[03:31:00]  Nice to work over there.  And after he has a few beers, he'll start just dropping the embalm right in front of Black  Ice.  And a few times I had to see him come getting his ass kicked.  I tell a couple guys to try to choke him out with his own bandana one time.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's bring him in again.  He likes a homeless guitar dude.  Let's get him all riled up.  Keith found a winner, though, for the homeless shopping spree.  This guy's going to be a star.  He's pretty smart, too.  He'll fix my friend's computer one day when you're sober.  Oh, really?  Why?  Is it going to be urinated on?  My friend brings him home sometimes and, like, you know, cleans him up a little bit. 
[03:31:30]  Bucks him up the...  Oh, what?  Cleans him up?  Yeah, yeah, because we work security across the street there.  And he's a guy who brings him home and, you know, whatever.  Let him hang out.  That's nice, man.  And he actually picks the guy's computer.  He's new to the Turk stock, so he's actually, you know...  He knows about computers?  Yeah, he does.  But then when he gets drunk, he'll just call the lady a cunt as she's walking by.  Thanks, Chris.  Wow. 
[03:32:00]  Belligerent.  Nice.  Belligerent drunk.  Hey, hi there, sir.  Oh, hit me Guinness now.  Hey, Pop Rock.  That's good.  Hey, Pop Rock, you know about computers?  Good rock.  Oh, boy.  You fix computers?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah?  What do you know about computers?  How to repair them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what kind of hurt, like...  Any program problems or anything like that?  You're able to like...  I got a two-year degree, yeah.  You do?  Yeah?  See, the guy... 
[03:32:30]  Missouri Institute of Technology.  MIT you went to?  No, that's Massachusetts.  Well, same thing.  Starts with an M.  Just trying to help you out.  Make it sound like you went to MIT.  I don't fake anything.  No, huh?  Oh, wait.  Okay.  All right.  Not myself, man.  Do you like the N-word?  No.  No?  Why?  Like Kramer used it to...  I've used it before, but then, you know, when I started thinking, I said, man, you don't 
[03:33:00]  do that.  No.  Just say...  Boom, boom.  Say coon.  I like white trash.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because we heard, you know, it's New York City, a couple of people know you, they see  you hanging around, and they call up the show, and they say that occasionally, after  a few wobbly pops, that you like to blurt out the N-word as black guys are walking by.  And a couple of times, a couple of them almost choked you out with your own bandana. 
[03:33:30]  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah, that might happen.  What happened?  They're walking by?  What'd you say?  Did you just say, hey, nigger?  I can't say that.  You can.  We want to know what you had.  Let me put it this way.  I learned my lesson.  I learned my lesson.  What'd they do?  What'd they do?  They used to call me on it, and that's it.  Taught you a little lesson?  I used to call Mexicans wet back, stuff like that.  Used to.  Did the black guys hit you?  No, used to.  Yeah, one did.  But the Puerto Ricans come to my aid. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  That's nice.  They like the police.  They like me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The Puerto Ricans.  And then occasionally.  I'm okay when I'm sober.  That's what we're hearing.  Because I also heard that when women walk by sometimes, if you'd been drinking, you'll  just yell out, cunt.  No, I'd say, you want to fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two of them walked by me one time.  Uh-oh.  And I said, hey, you want to fuck?  And they kept walking.  Then they walked back. 
[03:34:30]  Ah.  And they said, hey, she wants to take you up on that.  Uh-huh.  I said, I'm just kidding.  Get out of here.  Wow.  You know, it's like any other comedian, man.  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  Oh, that's terrific.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think.  Wow.  So, obviously, your demeanor changes when you've been drinking.  Personality.  Everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  So, what did you say to the black guys?  You can tell us.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  I don't like that.  I don't like it.  All right, but what did you say?  You don't have to like it, but what did you say?  It's not, we can say it, you know, with you saying, you're just repeating what you said,  it's an awful thing, and you don't do this anymore.  Right.  But just to, you know, get a little basis in fact here, what did you say back then?  We know it was wrong.  We know it was terrible, but what was it?  All right.  There was a black dude laying there, and I was like on vodka, and that's a destroyer. 
[03:35:30]  Mental note.  And I walked by, and he was laying there, you know, and I walked by, and I said, you know,  a nigga laying there.  Ah.  And he pulls my strap and everything, gets up.  But I'm on my way over.  He pulls my strap and everything.  He bops me outside the head.  Mm.  And the Puerto Rican messenger people, you know, they come to my aid and everything, you 
[03:36:00]  know.  But I'm shaming myself for doing that.  Ah.  That's no good, man.  I'm not a KKK or nothing like that, you know.  Yeah, that was a better apology than Kramer's on Letterman right there.  Yeah.  You know, that comes straight from the heart, baby, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now you're down with the brothers out there on the street?  I try to be.  Yeah.  In fact, I got several people at Rockefeller, you know.  We hang out and everything.  Boom, boom. 
[03:36:30]  They help me out.  Isn't that ironic?  He lives in a place named after Rockefeller.  One of the richest people.  You know.  Now it's Tishman Spire.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fun.  But I hang out right across the street from Nintendo World and all, you know.  Yeah.  And my Rockefeller people.  We.  We got a lot of black people and we all get along.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, I changed my attitude.  I changed my drinking habits the whole bit.  I saw you went from Bud to Guinness.  Don't even laugh. 
[03:37:00]  Why?  You're laughing at that.  That's kind of funny.  Hey, I like both Bud and Guinness.  All right.  Well.  You do?  Make a black and tan.  I like Sanhides.  What?  8.2% alcohol.  Oof.  I like Sterno.  100%.  Well, I like hairspray.  How do you like that?  Oh, beat that.  Yeah?  Beat that.  You ever have to resort to maybe drinking a little hairspray or mouthwash?  No.  Stuff like that? 
[03:37:30]  No.  Leave that for the Mexicans.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Dirty wetbacks.  Yeah.  Go to Gallup.  I live in Arizona.  Boom, boom.  Oh.  Them and the, well, you deal with the Mexicans and the Indians, right?  Don't even go there when they're drunk.  Right.  And when are they not?  Am I right or wrong?  At least I woke up sober.  Yeah, right.  Ah.  Okay.  They're drunk all the time.  Tell us a little about the Indians. 
[03:38:00]  I can't.  Sounds like...  Yeah?  They're all laying around.  They're all laying around.  That's it.  And you can call them bad things and they're too lazy to stand up and hit you.  They're too drunk.  Too drunk.  Yeah, of course.  What are you saying?  I said...  Is that your Indian impression?  What do you think I said?  You want a rock?  Get the skull fracture on it.  And then what happened?  I don't know what he's doing.  You want a beer? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, that was all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I put on.  Everything I do like that is just a put on.  Oh, of course.  We know.  It's a goof.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeff and yours.  You kidding around, boom, boom.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, Opie, I got a request for you.  Can you play some Smashing Pumpkins?  Yeah, that sounds good.  All right.  Thank you.  Josh or John in Indiana.  Yeah, John.  Anthony, Lord Jim, don't let Opie have the guitar.  Yeah, I'm starting to lean that way. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  What are we going to do with Homeless Guitar, dude?  Hmm.  One more song before you get out of here?  No, you got to play.  Oh.  Well, you played first and then I played.  I can't play on a speech of garbage.  No, I can play.  Trust me.  I know that.  You don't like that?  You heard a little, right?  I don't like that guitar.  I hate this.  Aw.  Well, just play a little something and then I'll play something.  That's fair.  Put down your Guinness for two seconds.  Yeah.  You can't.  Yeah, you can't. 
[03:39:30]  Just chug it.  There you go.  Fucking chug it.  Make it all go away.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  That's it.  Trust me.  Oh, there's milk.  There you go.  How am I?  Yeah.  How am I?  Feeling better, right?  Whoa.  Yeah.  Nice.  I'll put milkman to hell.  I'll put him to shame and I like it.  All right.  That's not my game.  He's got to be on the homestopingspring.  Yeah, he will be. 
[03:40:00]  Back up over there and play a little guitar and then I'm going to play.  Go back to where you are.  Give him a little room.  Oh, no.  Give him a little room.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  You play, I play.  That's how it works.  You play, I play.  One last tune, John.  All right.  One last tune, Mr. Rock.  How about Lucille?  Yeah.  A rock classic.  Well, I'm going to tell you something, baby doll.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  I want to tell you something.  I don't know.  He's got a little gay in him, man.  We all.  We all.  I've been married three times. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah?  Not to men.  Dude, you're good, man.  You've got to get on a stage and do some of that comedy.  I don't need to do that.  I need to play.  Sam, move him over.  Bruce Stinkstein.  Yeah, over there.  Here, push him over there.  Yeah, we're trying to get you on the stage so that...  Oh, this camera doesn't work, though.  Oh, that's...  No, I know.  Oh, I was trying to help out the pal talkers.  All right.  Homeless guitar dude, whenever you're ready.  I don't know. 
[03:41:00]  He's digging for a pick.  Oh, you want the one you gave me?  Nope.  Just pick that off the back of your neck and play with that.  Huh?  I'm using toothpicks.  That's why they call it a pick.  You want this one?  Nope.  You sure?  Yeah.  Which one is that?  The one you gave me.  I gave him to him.  No.  Did you touch your tooth with that?  You just touched your tooth with that pick.  I gave you a crazy person.  I did.  I was picking my teeth.  I gave you a put in your mouth.  Just hold it in your mouth.  Give me a ten box.  Why did you do that? 
[03:41:30]  Twenty.  Why did you do that?  Twenty.  Oh, my God.  Is that...  What are you doing, homeless guitar dude?  We got a...  I know.  We got a radio show to do it.  We got record people listening.  I'm molesting my equipment.  What happened?  Batteries?  No.  Cable.  Yeah.  Cable this time.  I never can get decent equipment.  No.  No.  It rains on us.  Yeah.  That helps it. 
[03:42:00]  You're on 40.  Okay.  Come on.  All right.  There you go.  Almost.  You almost had it right there.  Come on.  Wait for it.  There you go.  You're 54 years old, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're on 1952.  All right.  He's adjusting all his...  He's got all these, like, electronic boxes all over his...  Belt.  All right.  What's that?  What are you doing, sir? 
[03:42:30]  He's just tuning his equipment.  Mm-hmm.  Why is it taking long?  He was just doing it before.  All right.  Because he's a bum.  Oh, shit.  I forgot for a second.  What's happening?  Oh, boy.  It's not looking like it's going to happen, huh?  Cable.  Yeah.  Cable.  It's a cable network.  Cable network?  Might need a new cable.  Would you mind doing me a favor?  What's that? 
[03:43:00]  I was talking to this.  Oh, you're talking to the box.  Mind working?  Oh, I see.  You were talking to your equipment.  I'm sure you've heard that before.  Yeah, see?  I'm beyond fascinated by this guy.  Beyond.  He needs a breathe right strip.  Yeah.  Give him one, Jim.  I know.  It was a Louisville Slugger retinitis.  What?  Ooh.  You're going to make me do it now.  Yeah.  It's not working. 
[03:43:30]  Is it the...  It's the amp.  Is it the amp?  Yeah.  The box with your pedals on it.  No.  It's this one.  The cord.  The little thing.  The batteries.  Or that guitar.  Or is it the retard holding it?  Between both of them, it's all of them.  Yeah.  You need a new cord, I think.  Jeez.  And sinuses.  Yeah, keep doing that.  You're doing what?  Jiggling the... 
[03:44:00]  Okay.  Christ.  Were you in Vietnam, an Agent Orange catcher?  Jesus.  Yes.  You're breathing like you just ran a marathon.  Because I want to play.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  Do you know a guy named Andrew?  No.  Out on the streets?  Like an Indian guy?  Hello. 
[03:44:30]  How are you?  Goes to the church.  Should we be nice and plug him into the real amp?  What real amp?  We have one?  Yeah.  He sucks, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's checking everything.  It's horrible.  For the 10th time, he's checking the exact same thing.  Yeah, there's three things.  The guitar, the amp, and that box of pedals that seems to fuck everything up when he touches it.  I got to get another amp.  Bypass.  You know what?  Here's what you do, my friend.  Take the cord out of the pedals. 
[03:45:00]  I know how to work it.  And put it right into the amp.  And that way you'll see if it's the pedals that's the problem.  And that cord...  Not the pedal, I can tell you.  You know how to work it, right?  You know how to work it.  Just tell me to go fuck myself.  I know.  But the thing is, the thing is, I'm afraid of getting shot because of the...  You won't.  It's got a cord in it and everything.  No, you won't get shocked.  How do you get shocked?  There's batteries.  You could get a little bit of voltage there, but you won't get enough amps to kill you.  Just enough to make us laugh. 
[03:45:30]  To kill you with that amp.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Plugged into...  An amp.  A real amplifier.  Jam out, sweetie.  Oh, boy.  It's the cord, isn't it?  This stupid thing.  Is it the guitar?  I can't get a decent guitar.  No, huh?  There you go.  We're getting there.  Oh, boy.  That sounds...  I...  See? 
[03:46:00]  Oh.  You got a short where?  In the guitar?  Yeah.  Jiggle the cord.  Yeah.  It's not that.  It's this.  It's pot.  Oh.  What happened?  It was working fine.  Yeah.  It was, but it gets boom, boom.  Opie, you know a little something about guitars, don't you?  No, not really.  I bet you could fix that.  I bet you could, too.  I bet you could make it.  I actually want you to fix it.  I bet Opie can make it so that that switch is no longer a problem at all. 
[03:46:30]  I bet he could make it.  So that switch is inconsequential.  I actually am rooting for you to fix it.  Yeah.  I can't believe I am, but I'd love you to fix it.  I really want you to fix that guitar.  I'd love you to give that guitar the fixing of its life.  Straighten it right out.  Yeah, this guy...  Bad switch, huh?  Bad cable.  Bad cable.  And guitar.  And the guitar.  When did you get that guitar, sir?  About a year and a half ago. 
[03:47:00]  About a year and a half ago?  Where'd you get it?  Dumpster.  Dumpster?  Sam Ash.  The dumpster at Sam Ash?  No.  Where'd you get it?  Sam Ash?  Same thing.  And how much was it?  75.  How'd you get 75 bucks?  The one I want is a B.C. Rich Beast.  Oh, yeah.  B.C. Rich.  No, you would have.  Absolutely, man.  Guitar Center.  From one guitar player to the other, man.  Guitar Center.  There we go.  Here we go.  Rock and roll. 
[03:47:30]  Getting ready for Thanksgiving.  Let's go, homeless guitar dude.  Play us out of here.  All right, the pedals.  Jesus.  Enough with the fumbling with the pedals.  Fucking guy.  Oh, no.  He bypassed your pedals and went direct.  Oh, no.  What'd you do?  You had it, you fucking.  He needs the pedals. 
[03:48:00]  You won't play without the pedals.  Sir, the pedals.  Oh, my God.  Would you forget the pedals for a minute?  You had it.  Must have hated those pedals.  Jesus Christ, with the pedals.  Enough about the pedals.  This one.  Yeah.  Fumbling with everything incompetently.  Finally, he's ready to go.  He's just fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble.  I'll tell you one thing.  It was working.  Why don't you stop fiddling with it?  He's perfect for this radio show to work behind the scenes.  It was perfect. 
[03:48:30]  Sir, it was fixed, and you just kept fiddling with it.  Fiddling.  It's not a fiddle.  I like this.  All right.  There we go.  Just play it.  Here we go.  Wait, the pedals are the pedals.  Oh, it cuts in and out because of the chords.  Tuning is optional.  There is a house in New Orleans.  Oh, you know that one?  They call the rising sun. 
[03:49:00]  There is a house, and I don't live in one.  Oh, he's atrocious.  You're a bad player, sir.  How about Paranoid, sir?  Can you play Paranoid?  It's a Sabbath.  Oh, my God.  He's still doing it.  Sir, what's wrong with the pedals? 
[03:49:30]  The pedals aren't working, right?  This is so awful.  I don't have it plugged in.  Oh, yeah, good.  Well, why don't you play Paranoid?  Why don't you do something?  Please do something, sir.  Play a little, yeah, something pretty.  A lot of, like, yeah, there you go.  Oh, yeah, I hear that.  I know what song that is.  That's, um...  Stop fiddling with everything. 
[03:50:00]  He keeps fiddling.  It is driving Jimmy crazy.  He's just fiddling with it incessantly.  And the funniest part is, um, the amp isn't even plugged in on his head.  No, it's not as plugged in.  It's plugged into the amp on the floor.  It's plugged into the amp on the floor, and he can't stop fiddling with it.  The batteries, the cord, it's just fiddling.  Sir, how about some distortion?  Why don't you stop fiddling with the amp?  How about some distortion? 
[03:50:30]  It's not plugged into the little amp.  And he keeps fiddling.  Oh, just fumbling with it.  Fiddler with crabs.  It's not even plugged in, dammit.  We know that.  We know.  We've been telling you that.  We've been telling you that for four hours already.  There he goes.  Now he's got it.  He's got it unplugged.  There you go.  Now lean over there and fumble with it some more.  Oh.  It's horrible.  This is, uh...  Could you tune the inside of your mouth with a shotgun?  This is one of the greatest days ever, man.  There you go.  This is so awful. 
[03:51:00]  It's just great radio.  I love it.  I can't even tell you.  Oh, this is horrible.  All right.  Here we go.  There we go.  Oh, a little STP.  Yeah, tune it.  Come on.  Tune it.  Keep playing it.  It keeps getting out of...  Keep playing that song.  Somebody have another guitar.  All right, cool.  Come on, play that STP song.  Yeah, it's your own Temple Pilots, man.  Yeah, right.  STP.  They're wonderful, beautiful people.  All right.  Will you...  Maybe not, but the place...  Well, she goes... 
[03:51:30]  What a fine time.  What a fine time.  To butt, butt, Lucille.  Butt, butt, Lucille.  For horny bankers jacking off in a field.  Everybody.  I've had some good butts, and I've had some bad butts.  This time your asshole won't heal.  You take the fine time to butt, butt, Lucille.  Thank you, Kenny Rogers. 
[03:52:00]  All right, go with...  Let's go with...  Oh, I just want to go home.  All right.  Hey, homeless guitar, dude.  Give us a...  Just jam on the guitar now.  Just go for a jam.  Jimmy just said it all.  What did he say?  Bitch, I just want to go home.  I just want to go home.  I know.  Another one bites at us.  Oh, that's funny.  I know.  That amp isn't plugged in, dude. 
[03:52:30]  Stop fumbling with it.  Turn this shit off.  No, come on.  What are you plugging in?  You're taking it out of the good one, and you're putting it back into the one that doesn't  work.  Why don't you stop meddling with that one and put it in the good one?  That's what she said.  He's fucking fumbling with it.  Sir, it was working in this one.  Now it's...  Now you've just got to keep reaching down. 
[03:53:00]  It's the cable.  You've just got to get the cable.  It's the fucking tuner.  He's just got to keep reaching down.  Work already.  Work already.  I'm used to my little baby.  We understand that, but it was working in that one.  Listen, Orange Juice.  Oh, will you stop?  It was working in that one.  Speaking of LJ.  Oh, my God almighty.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  It was working in that one, and he plugs it back into the one on his hip. 
[03:53:30]  Will you stop picking at it?  And put it back in there?  We're running out of show.  So am I.  I don't like this.  Johnny, put it in the big one.  Please stop.  I don't like this.  My ribs are.  Oh.  Will you put it into the one that was working and stop trying to make it all better?  There you go.  Put it in there, and just stop incessantly fiddling with the things on your belt. 
[03:54:00]  Jimmy, you've got to stop.  You can't breathe.  Now you've got to put the other one in.  You can't breathe.  That's a cable.  It's nonstop already since Free FM.  You have been fucking fumbling incompetently with that equipment.  Oh, my God.  It's incompetent equipment.  I'm trying.  I'm fucking trying.  I'm going to tie it straight into the end.  He's still reaching for the left one.  I'm going to break it.  Oh, my God, dude. 
[03:54:30]  My ribs are killing me.  I can't take it.  All right.  Sir, if you touch that pedal again, I'm going to throw something at it.  You're touching the pedal.  Just, you don't need the pedal, sir, please.  Yes, I do.  You don't.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, let me breathe for 30 seconds.  Please.  I'm sitting next to him.  You don't want to.  I haven't left that hard.  It's on the floor.  I can't take it.  I don't know why this is so funny to me. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, my God.  Can you just...  Oh, my God.  Now he's...  What are you doing with the one of the...  Now he's with the amp on the floor.  He's plugging it, unplugging it.  Sir, what are you doing?  Just play the fucking instrument.  Just play it.  Strum it.  I'm trying to.  You're not trying to.  You're fucking...  Oh, my God.  You are...  I hate this thing.  You should...  I need everything to work properly.  Sir, it's not going to work properly.  I'm going to go without the street.  Believe me. 
[03:55:30]  And now you're touching the amp that it's not plugged into.  This is mind-boggling to me.  That you don't understand how that amp is not working.  Stupid battery shit.  Yeah, we understand it's the battery.  But the one on the floor is plugged in.  And your guitar is plugged into that one.  So could you please play us a song?  Do you understand?  Two countries are hearing you fucking fiddle with that equipment.  And now he's unplugging the one on the floor.  And he's plugging it back into the one on his hip.  This can't be happening. 
[03:56:00]  All we want is a tune.  Okay.  You've got to stop.  But it's plugged back into the fucking hip one again.  You've got to stop, Jimmy.  Sir, I mean this with all due respect.  Will you just take that out of there  and put it into the one on the floor, please,  so we can hear a song?  It is bugging him so bad.  Because it is an endless cycle of fiddling  and nothing is getting accomplished.  No, it's just cable here.  I don't care what it is.  Plug it in.  Oh, my God. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, God.  There.  You sure you don't want to pull it out  and plug it back into the hip one again?  Holy shit.  All right.  Are we ready for a song?  We don't care about that.  Just cleaning over it.  Will you stop touching it?  Just play.  Strum. 
[03:57:00]  Watch.  Let's see how long it takes  to go for the one on the hip.  It's not even plugged into the hip.  Pettles again.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  There we go.  All right.  You've got to get the better pick.  Of course.  Of course.  That was the problem.  He doesn't play.  No.  There he goes.  He's reaching.  Stop reaching.  Stop.  Stop touching that fucking equipment.  Back off from the equipment.  He plays and he stops and looks. 
[03:57:30]  He's fiddling with equipment  that is not plugged in.  Oh, it's enraging.  Oh, that would sound great  with some distortion.  This won't last long.  How can it?  He'll stop it in a second  and he'll fumble  with the fucking pedal again.  Look, he's got to fuck.  Oh, my God.  There you go, of course.  I fell on the fucking floor. 
[03:58:00]  I was laughing so hard.  Play some Stone Temple Pilots.  It doesn't sound right.  You need the distortion  with the pedals.  Yeah, right.  See?  They use pedals.  You got pedals?  It doesn't have pedals.  It don't work.  It's a dirty box.  Listen, we've got to get out of here.  Thank you.  It's a dirty box.  Give us one.  Of course.  He's touching.  I'm just touching. 
[03:58:30]  He's always a little,  just a busy body,  a little touchy.  He's fiddling.  Well, we got a new name.  Bo Fiddley.  That's kind of like your  That's kind of like  your equipment up there, right?  Oh, yeah.  I could not fucking breathe.  She went  flying down the mountain  doing my mighty mountain.  We know the titties  on the spokes.  We heard this one already.  They broke.  We understand  what's going to happen here.  Stupidly heard this.  She went flying  across the grass  with a muffler  up her ass. 
[03:59:00]  And her  titties playing Dixie  on the spokes.  Oh, nice.  He is so in  on the homeless  shopping spree.  He's got everything it takes.  He's homeless.  He's annoying.  Grand finale time.  Oh, look, look, look.  There you go.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Twist, turn.  Maybe this will make it all better.  Maybe this will bring her back.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  I'll wake up  and the comfort will be there  and I'll be home.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Fix it all.  Make everything better. 
[03:59:30]  Twist, turn, plug, unplug, unplug.  What's wrong?  We're going to go wrong.  Plug, unplug.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Unplug, unplug.  Put the square.  Unplug, unplug, unplug.  Make it all better.  Make it all better.  Make it all better.  Things didn't turn out this way.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Shake a little.  Shake a little.  Shake a little.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Twist.  All right.  The ambulance is on the way.  Drum, drum, drum.  Oh, tune, tune.  Break, tune.  Plug, unplug.  Who cut your hair?  Shut up.  Shut up.  You used that one already.  It'll make it all better.  Okay.  It'll make it all better.  It's your time to play.  It certainly is.  Well, I said what I want to happen. 
[04:00:00]  He did say that.  I want you to give us a really good jam.  Like, what do I have to shred?  And then I shred.  Give me a shred.  I can't do this.  Yes, you can.  This equipment is messed up.  Do the best you can.  Just shred that guitar.  You already plugged into the big amp, buddy.  It's all you need.  Give me the big sound.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking go.  You're paranoid.  Yeah.  Some Sabbath.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Play some Sabbath. 
[04:00:30]  Where's that?  There you go, Tim.  Might as well.  I told you.  It's a crappy guitar.  We understand that.  We understand.  Wow.  You just won't stop touching everything.  You don't build a house with a rubber handle.  That's a good point.  You don't do that right.  A handle.  A handle.  Just stop touching everything.  There you go.  There you go.  Now just.  All right.  Two little two terms.  That's good.  You get a couple of strums out of them.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I got to do it quick.  Yes, you do.  And you'll be saying that again in about 30 seconds. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Oh, no.  Oh, I've never really heard of it.  Now this is done.  Yeah.  Oh, I believe.  You see the end of a Kiss concert, sir?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I can certainly do it.  The Who at Woodstock.  Strangling yourself.  You familiar with that?  I always do.  All right.  I hate this stuff, man.  I hate it.  Yeah.  So do we.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't blame you.  This guitar is all you.  I need room to perform.  You need room to perform? 
[04:01:30]  He's dragging my cord.  Oh, there's my battery.  Oh, you found it.  Thank God.  Things are going to be all better now.  Put it back in the thing.  That's good.  Yeah.  Put it back in there.  Just.  What do you want to hear?  What do you want to hear?  I want to hear it crashed up against the wall.  Wow.  Really?  He's heard this show before.  You really don't know this guy very well.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[04:02:00]  Okay.  I can't look.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Here you go.  Now, why don't you pick it up and fumble with it?  Fiddle.  Oh, no.  Might work better now.  Jesus Christ.  Now, what am I going to do?  Oh, no. 
[04:02:30]  Did you hear that?  Now, what am I going to do?  Now, what am I going to do?  Body parts.  I was like, treat yourself.  That's better than Howard Stern.  Now, what am I going to do?  Now, what am I going to do?  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, boy.  I don't want to fix that.  Reality thing.  I don't have anything anymore.  Oh, fuck.  Shit. 
[04:03:00]  At least it saved the strap.  Would you get the hell off of me?  I don't like scarves.  They're for faggots.  He's looking at his guitar. 
[04:03:30]  I can't play.  Maybe a little glue.  I don't want to play.  You know, all he does is play that guitar all day.  It's all he's got.  All the music.  Oh, my God.  Is there a doctor in the house? 
[04:04:00]  You all right?  Yeah.  What about this, Mary?  I don't...  My baby.  My baby's dead.  It's like my last three wives.  Yeah, have a little beer. 
[04:04:30]  I'll straighten it out.  Damn, you can play good.  Thank you, sir.  Plays like Pete Townsend.  The who?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  No, I mean he fucks little boys.  What?  Oh, I heard about that. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Who didn't?  That just needs a little Elmer's glue.  I got some super glue.  Super glue, yeah.  Yeah.  And I bet the switch won't have to...  Imagine the fucking...  Hey, happy holidays.  Yeah.  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.  Oh, God.  Can I throw up now or later?  Right now.  Where's milk, man?  Like a gurgling sound if you can throw up. 
[04:05:30]  I can't believe that.  It's just laying there.  What are you going to do all day?  Yeah, what are you going to do all day?  I bet you play guitar all day, right?  I got some glue.  I can put it together.  I bet you play guitar all day long, right?  That's like all you got, right?  Yes.  So what are you going to do until you get one?  How much money do you have?  You all right?  You all right, sir? 
[04:06:00]  Night, baby.  I'll put it together.  You think you could get it back together?  Because I can't imagine what you would do all day.  That's all you got, sir.  It's the music.  Speaking of...  Body parts.  Where's Howard Stern when he needed?  Not here, sir.  Thank you.  He's...  He'd make a good one on body parts.  We can get you a serious...  Yeah.  You can live in it.  You could actually...  Get out of here.  ...live in a serious satellite unit. 
[04:06:30]  Come on, get in.  You could go over...  Well, we'll look...  Jesus.  Setting him up to be robbed.  In the spirit of the holiday.  Yeah.  You all right there, sir?  You all right?  You all right?  You seem a little worked up.  Thinking about the lonely days and nights.  What?  Just passing by now without having anything to play.  You know?  Because that's what you do all day is play guitar, right? 
[04:07:00]  And now what are you going to do?  Jack off.  Couldn't sound any worse.  At least he's got his priorities.  Guitar, jack off.  I hear you.  He probably can't come because he keeps fiddling with his balls and his testicles and the helmet.  Every time he's close to coming, he reaches down and toys or something.  Fiddle in his package.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Make it better.  Fiddle, fiddle.  What happened?  Fiddle, fiddle.  You all right?  Wow. 
[04:07:30]  I'll get another one somehow.  Yeah, somehow.  I guess.  Yeah, one shit.  He's picking up the pieces of the guitar.  Actually used the big piece to bash a tourist over the head and rob him.  You can fix that.  I don't rob anybody.  Let me see.  He's trying to put it back together.  You're a man of peace, and so is your guitar.  Pieces?  Nothing?  Okay.  Pieces.  My jewel says, pieces of you.  Aw.  Hey, someone has a good idea.  Get him some wow stickers to help put the thing back. 
[04:08:00]  Oh, hey, that's a good idea.  What about the neck?  Where's the neck, sir?  It's dangling by his legs.  He's attempting to play the broken guitar.  Put it back together.  Are you going to try to play the broken guitar, sir?  Is that fixable?  Yeah.  What's the diagnosis?  Is that fixable, you think?  It's just the body is split in half, and the neck is broken off.  All the pickups and stuff have been ripped out, I guess. 
[04:08:30]  Um, but, can you fix it?  You know, my dad's got an ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  Um, what do you do?  I got an ultimate tool, but I won't fix it.  No, huh?  All right.  What are you going to do now, tonight?  Like, you usually hang out and play your guitar, right?  Yeah.  All day and all night.  It's all you do.  Yeah.  So, what are you going to do with yourself now?  Play. 
[04:09:00]  I got my wow.  Oh, wow.  He's shaking up.  Yeah, he's, he's, uh...  Jesus Christ.  Yes?  Yeah.  He's bothered.  Yeah, he's definitely...  So, are you a little upset?  Trying to cover it up with humor.  Are you all right?  Are you all right?  Yeah.  You know, there's no crying in guitar playing.  You know that, right?  You're a strong guy trying to cover up with humor that you're a little upset.  With what happened.  But we understand.  It's okay. 
[04:09:30]  We understand.  Give me some vodka and I'll let you know exactly what I know.  Uh-oh.  Have some vodka.  It's all over, right?  The day.  That's why I don't...  The fiddling.  I don't drink much of it anymore.  Died.  Sir, what are you going to do now that you have nothing to do with it?  I thought you could play guitar.  I played, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, you did a kick-butt job.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to hang out.  Me and you.  Homeless shopping spree.  What's that?  You'll know in a couple weeks. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  All right?  It's really good.  You'll enjoy it.  Oh, boy.  Should I?  Here we go.  Yeah, it's this...  He's all fucking...  Well, it's just because it's Thanksgiving, though.  He's really bad.  Oh, my God.  He's crying.  I'm a little...  He's crying.  Dude, he's fucking crying.  Are you crying?  No.  Oh, yes, he is.  Oh, boy.  Sir, that's all you had.  Yeah.  That's my baby.  Help the nigger out.  Come on.  Well, here's the deal, you know.  Sir, what are you trying to plug that into? 
[04:10:30]  I don't know.  There's nothing to play.  Stop fiddling.  Sir, you plug that into what?  It's all he does all day.  What do you...  Don't you understand?  Now it's forced a habit.  What does he play?  So he...  There's no playing...  He's turning volume knobs.  He's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is he going to try to play air guitar?  Yeah, but play air guitar.  Maybe that'll work.  There you go.  All right, now you're rocking.  All right.  Now fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle a little.  And then play some air guitar.  I've got to have my...  My wow.  I've got to have that. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  Well, the wow's in half, too.  Yeah.  I was going to put it on my guitar.  Well, that won't happen.  That ain't happening.  Because that's in parts, too.  Sir, what are you going to do now that you have nothing to do?  All right.  There you go.  I am rock, you whore, roll.  I am you wish you're not.  I am I will prevail.  Biatch, I am black ugly monster. 
[04:11:30]  Now air guitar.  There you go.  Get on that, bitch.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Oh, my God.  All right, well.  That's what I normally do.  It's a little known fact that right around Thanksgiving, yeah, I tend to break out of  character.  There's not going to be any turkeys this year.  Oh, for the holidays, you're coming out of Thanksgiving, Anthony.  All right.  Just for Thanksgiving.  It's a once, one time a year that I do the right thing. 
[04:12:00]  Please let the audience know who we're speaking with here.  What smells?  What?  Let the audience know who's speaking.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  A little known fact that right around Thanksgiving every year, I break character to do the right  thing.  It only happens once a year.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  John, you know, some of you might have laughed today when, oh, look, he's upset.  He's really upset.  Hey.  We only break down the eighth wall the day before Thanksgiving. 
[04:12:30]  It's very rare.  This only happens once a year.  Sir, enjoy it.  Look at what we got for you.  Enjoy your brand new guitar.  That's for you, my friend.  That's for you.  That's for you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Now plug it in and play something for us.  And you rock, goddammit.  Play something for us.  Plug that in and fucking rock.  Play something.  Play something for us.  Oh.  Brand new fucking guitar.  Wow, this is like, this is like Tyra. 
[04:13:00]  Oh.  A Schechter, my friend.  I just had an orgasm.  Oh.  I love it.  I am the rock.  Now play.  Now play your heart out.  I'm going to have to learn how to fiddle on that fucking thing.  Oh, look, he's fiddling.  Jesus Christ.  If you reach for that, I'm going to break it.  Give me an E, you.  Yeah, give him an E.  Give me an F.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  E.  Jesus Christ.  I'm never going to get the fuck out of here with him tuning this thing. 
[04:13:30]  Listen, man.  Once a year.  Oh.  Only once a year.  That was like one of those end of an episode things where you sit there and go, hi.  You know, we may have all laughed today at a homeless man's expense.  There you go.  All is right with the world, sir.  He's fucking terrible.  Dude, you like the guitar?  It's fucking awful.  What a waste of a great guitar. 
[04:14:00]  He went right back to fiddling.  It sounds...  If he fucking fiddles with one more thing, I'm going to throw the fuck out of here.  It immediately turns into a shit guitar.  I love this.  You love it?  How can you suck this bad if you do it all day?  All day.  All day.  How is it?  How's the action for you?  Good?  You like it? 
[04:14:30]  I love it.  All right.  I'll take it away from him.  I love it.  You know, I play guitar too.  So I'll have to break the news to him.  He's awful.  I can see.  All right.  Can you play us out of here?  We've got to go home for the holiday.  Yes.  Well, that's actually a pleasure.  We've got family to see, homes to be in.  And not only the guitar, but we've got a bar of soap for you.  And you.  And a bar of soap for you.  Oh, shit. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah.  He's fiddling.  What's he doing and why?  What's he doing and why?  What are you doing?  What are you?  Why are you twisting that knob?  Can I ask?  As a novice, you're gone awful at this.  All that fiddling and it sounds exactly as it did.  Stop fucking fiddling.  Jimmy hit the nail on the head, though, which is just trying to fix his life and do the symbolism of all that. 
[04:15:30]  The minute I do it this way, I'll have a place to live.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  Play us out.  That's all we want.  Oh, now he's sitting on it.  Where's the my children's woke knob?  You know, I need to turn that up.  Oh, boy, fiddling.  Yeah. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, God.  Shut up.  It just sounds like he's got his fingers stuck in the strings.  It just sounds like he's got his fingers stuck in the strings.  It just sounds like he's got his fingers stuck in the strings. 
[04:16:30]  It's too late.  Oh, forget it.  Stinks.  Johnny Slobo.  Distortion.  What?  Give me some distortion on that sucker.  What distortion?  Nothing going to help this.  Unless you want that guitar distorted like your last one.  Oh, no.  Quick, you're pitching. 
[04:17:00]  He's the worst guitarist I've ever heard.  He is the worst.  The line of the day sponsored by Bodogfight.com.

There you go, Anthony with line of the day.  Please laugh.  It made me happy.  Hey, do we have to?  We don't have to go to break, right?  Can we dig that?  I knew that you could.  The LA Times called his speech poignant.  Huh? 
[04:18:30]  Are you shitting me?  No.  The stupid LA Times.  What happened?  They said that he had a poignant.  I knew dig that?  Oh, brother.  I knew that you could.  Called his speech poignant.  Yeah.  All right, have a great weekend.  That can also mean sucks.  Hey, after the break, you want him just in studio till noon?  Do you think I give a flying fuck?  I will be gone.  Just turn on his mic after the break and see what's going on, all right?  Sure.  We'll have him fiddle until Ron and Fez get here.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  See you, um, uh, at the holidays. 
[04:19:00]  Jimmy, one of the biggest laughs in a long time.  My fucking stomach hurts.  Just fiddling.  Knock it off.  Fiddle, fidddle, fidddle, fidddle, fidddle, fidddle.  All right, guys.
