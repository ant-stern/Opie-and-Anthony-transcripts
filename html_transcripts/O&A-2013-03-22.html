<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about their show's intro, featuring celebrities like Larry King, 50 Cent, and Mike Tyson, which one host found "fucked up." They briefly touched upon past show themes, including a successful "E-Rock" theme and an unsuccessful "Gay Day," before transitioning to a discussion of payola and reminiscing about subtly accepting money for plugs.  The hosts then recounted their appearance on Red Eye, commenting on the political leanings of its hosts.  This segued into a discussion about one host's son's SpongeBob Band-Aids, Yoko Ono's possession of John Lennon's blood-stained glasses, and the value of a Honus Wagner baseball card, prompting a fantasy about publicly destroying one to inflate its value.  The conversation shifted to an Atlanta mall security guard fired for exposing himself on YouTube and speculation about the mall's subsequent decline.  The hosts then introduced the "Friday Initiative," a plan to feature listener-submitted talent, mentioning potential candidates including a Cosmo channel host and their bathroom cleaner, who identifies as a filmmaker.

A significant portion of the show focused on a listener's boast about his uncle's new boat, sparking a conflict with a host who initially disliked the listener but secretly wanted to go tuna fishing.  This led to lengthy anecdotes about past boat trips, including a harrowing Lake Ontario experience involving mythical lake monsters and a more pleasant trip to the Thousand Islands.  The hosts discussed the Thousand Islands' unique geography, power challenges, and unusual island ownership, along with Lake Ronkonkoma's murky history.  One host shared a humorous childhood anecdote about a disastrous first underwater experience.  Simultaneously, Sal recounted his island life, jokingly mentioning waging war with neighbors and complaining about the bureaucratic hurdles of installing a generator and propane tank using considerable profanity.  A caller shared an absurd story about his grandfather's alleged island travel method involving "space," eliciting further jokes and speculation. The "Friday Initiative" continued to be discussed, with a guest's attempt to showcase their "hidden talent" failing to yield anything noteworthy beyond childhood experiences and a discussion of their grandfather.  Sam Roberts discussed his childhood appearance on *Figure It Out*, his growth hormone treatments, and explicit details about the resulting physical changes.  The hosts discussed the difficulty of finding shooting ranges in NYC and launched into an extended critique of Paul Rudd's acting career, claiming he plays the same character in every movie.  The show interspersed several Beatles songs from *Please Please Me* with their commentary.

A later segment centered on Ryan Gosling's break from acting, leading to Opie's desire for a part-time food delivery job in Manhattan and a yearning to return to caddying.  The hosts reflected on past firings from radio jobs, contrasting past and present radio culture, and their career trajectories.  A call with Steve, a therapist, discussing recurring dreams of being unprepared for responsibilities, led to a graphic discussion of Anthony's lucid dreaming experiences involving violent and sexual acts, along with further discussion of wet dreams and Sam Robert's childhood hormone treatments.  A substantial portion focused on Sal’s perceived lack of work ethic and initiative, contrasted with the hosts' and other staff members' experiences.  His family's wealth and lack of prior work experience were discussed at length, leading to comparisons and criticism of his attitude.

A segment focused heavily on further critique of Sal's lack of initiative, using profane language throughout.  Specific examples of his perceived failures included a negative reaction to criticism of a "panda" bit, refusal to redo a production piece ("Tiger"), and general lack of follow-through. The hosts contrasted this with their own proactive approaches.  The Cuban, a chef catering for the show, provided commentary and anecdotes about his restaurant.  The hosts also reacted to viral videos of a child reciting presidential quotes and a woman describing a hailstorm. Sal's postponed drum performance and upcoming show plans were discussed.  Sam Roberts briefly mentioned post-show plans involving filming an episode of "Opie's Elevator Show."

Another segment focused on Opie's "Elevator Show," promoting a Bob Saget episode and plans for a Sal drum performance. Opie emphasized the show's online importance over the radio show, focusing on views and clicks.  A humorous exchange about Troy Kwan's age and high school years ensued, along with a mention of Bill Bradley and Knicks players from the 1970s.  The attempt to film the elevator drum performance went awry, leading to confrontations with building security.  A text from Justin Stengel praising the Elevator Show was revealed.  The segment ended with further discussion of the Elevator Show, a future episode, and the release of an Opie and Anthony mixtape.

The final segment detailed a conflict between Opie and a SiriusXM employee.  This led to anecdotes about illegally giving Anthony a gun, a woman with "booty," Opie taking his Venezuelan girlfriend for an abortion (without his wife’s knowledge), and a discussion about Opie's attractiveness and sexual prowess.  A Dollar Shave Club read and plugs for various side projects, including the Bob Saget elevator show and DJ gigs, were interspersed.  The segment ended with a summary evaluation of Sal's performance for the day, all laced with vulgar language, sexually explicit references, and offensive stereotypes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Yep!  Oh yeah.  That song means one thing.  Friday.  Friday, right.  I was just telling Ann how ridiculous it is that we have Larry King, 50 Cent,  and Mike Tyson doing our show open. 
[00:00:30]  Doing the show opener.  That's so fucked up to me.  That's pretty fun.  It's cool as hell.  So last Friday was Tequila and Donut Day.  Yeah.  What was Roland talking about yesterday?  He said, I'll get some food.  Oh yeah.  We'll probably get some food in here.  Yeah, we'll get some food in here.  Roland's good like that.  I don't think anyone's going to beat the E-Rock theme show anytime soon.  No.  Not at all. 
[00:01:00]  But I welcome anyone to try to take down E-Rock.  Oh, good luck.  For the best theme show ever.  Good luck.  Was that the best theme show ever?  I think so.  That was a good one.  What about Gay Day?  Gay Day?  Not so much.  Getting food from Heartland Brewery today.  That's a nice plug, Ola.  Heartland Brewery.  I know a bunch of old DJs.  Disc jockeys. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  That were all in with the plug, Ola.  A little mention here, a little mention there.  And they would just get some nice pocket money for the weekend.  One of the perks of the business.  But they would make it so smooth you didn't even know.  Even the guys down the hall didn't know.  And next thing you know, some cash was being exchanged.  The nature of the business, it's the payola blues.  I kind of had that song stuck in my head.  Oh, man, right?  Just because of that.  Smugglers.  Smugglers. 
[00:02:00]  Fuck.  Yeah.  Did Red Eye last night.  That was fun.  That was good.  All the guys over there.  Yeah.  They're very nice.  They always say hi.  Does the whole gang hate Obama?  No, actually.  Get a mix of people?  No, I think Bill Schultz.  Schultz?  Yeah, I don't think he minds them.  He doesn't mind them too much?  No.  And Andy Levy's more a libertarian.  He's not a Republican or a Democrat.  Right.  And Gutfeld, he kind of skews Republican. 
[00:02:30]  But, you know, it's Fox News.  It's a good mix.  It's Fox News, people.  Oh, Jesus.  I want to show you this.  What the hell you got going on?  You must have gone to the dermatologist.  No.  Oh.  What the fuck?  My son's new thing is he likes to play doctor.  Oh, Jesus.  And he decided to have five fucking boo-boos on my left arm.  So I got these SpongeBob Band-Aids.  Those are very colorful.  But he put them on my hairy arm.  Yeah, that's going to.  And I just don't feel like ripping them off one by one. 
[00:03:00]  So I got five fucking like this.  I went to bed like this, and then I took a shower like this.  Wow, that's really stick.  Why are they showing John Lennon's bloody glasses on TV?  They selling that shit too?  What?  Yoko tweeted it out as like an anti-gun message.  And then Obama retweeted it.  Obama retweeted it.  Were you just being English there, or were you being literal?  His bloody glasses.  Oh, my.  But wasn't that image used as like one of her album covers? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, it's a very powerful image, obviously.  It's a great photo.  The only reason I bring it up, because we've seen the glasses over the years.  These are the weird things I kind of think about in my head.  Do you think she ever like cleaned the glasses?  No.  And put them away?  No.  No.  Got a little eyeglass cleaner and finally said, okay.  Exactly, Sam.  Okay.  Yeah.  I took a lot of pictures of this.  Uh-huh.  They're powerful images.  I put it on one of my album covers. 
[00:04:00]  I think Travis is right about that.  Now it's time to clean the glasses.  Yeah.  Or are they still just bloody in her apartment?  Oh, they're probably bloody.  They're just still bloody in her apartment there at the Dakota?  Yeah.  Bring those to fucking Pawn Stars out there in Vegas.  Yeah.  I have a John Nennon's bloody glasses.  Uh, yeah.  You know, there's really no market for this.  It's going to take up room in my shop.  Ah.  Wouldn't you like to see shit like that, though? 
[00:04:30]  Uh, yeah, that would be kind of, uh, it's a little creepy.  Does Yoko, um, uh, do tours of her apartment?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Imagine.  Just lets people go up there.  That's, those are the bloody glasses.  Wait, did I say imagine?  Wow.  Ah, good one.  Thank you very much.  Why the glass of water?  What is she doing?  It's half full or half empty.  Maybe it's a thing about optimism.  Season of glass.  Ah.  And it's the bloody glasses on a windowsill overlooking Central Park, because it's the  Dakota on the corner of 72nd and Central Park West, for the people that don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Was it supposed to be Season of Grass?  But, uh, yeah.  You'll go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to lead to something.  Oh, the Honus Wagner card.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are they going to really get three million?  They might, but I'm going to go see it today.  I didn't know it was on display.  Where is it?  It's at, uh, some, like, high-end luxury watch store on 57th Street.  It's only there for a week.  Oh, I know what.  That's the watch store between 7th and, uh, 6th, I believe. 
[00:05:30]  No.  Or, or 6th and 5th.  It's between Madison and Park.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's the one between Madison and Park.  That one.  Wait, I think it's the one with the big fucking watchy thing on the outside of the store,  right?  I'll tell you.  Yeah, show me, show me where it's at.  I would go check out the Honus Wagner card, huh?  I would check out the Honus Wagner card.  Or Audemars Piguet luxury watch store.  Oh.  But they're expecting, one of the Honus Wagner cards is being sold today or soon, and it's 
[00:06:00]  pushing three million dollars.  It's already up to 1.29 million.  Yeah.  And they think it'll push three.  That's crazy.  For one card.  Is that a good investment?  I don't know why.  Really?  Yes.  Why?  Why?  Because it only goes up in value.  The last one sold for 1.6 million four years ago.  What if somebody goes up into their attic and finds a fucking box of them, and they're original? 
[00:06:30]  Like, it would just...  Well, what you'd have to do, you know, you can't be stupid.  What you would have to do, you want to break this down?  Yeah.  You find a whole box of mint condition Honus Wagner cards in your grandma's attic.  Uh-huh.  You, first of all, have to burn all of them except for one, and never tell anybody you  found a whole box.  You know that, right?  You would have to.  You're right.  That's how it works.  Yeah, yeah.  If you just, like, announce to the world you got a whole box of these things, you're fucking 
[00:07:00]  everybody over, including yourself.  Man.  So you would have to burn all of them except for one, and then make sure you take care  of that one.  Maybe you hide them in a vault, though, and then, like, 20 years down the road, you pull  one more out.  One by one, right?  Yeah, you just, uh, here you go.  All right.  Okay.  People would forget, and then they'd start thinking, uh, you might not get as much, but  You can't take the chance that someone's going to find that vault, though.  Oh, man.  Because then you fuck up your whole strategy.  It's like, uh, fucking Biff.  You gotta put it in the vault.  And if some old, crazy old man or some kid starts asking questions, you gotta kill them. 
[00:07:30]  I wish I had so much fucking money, right?  Yeah.  I marched down to this auction, and I buy this thing for whatever the fuck.  I just outbid everybody.  Yeah.  And then in front of the press and all these collectors and all, I just hold it up like  this.  First of all, I take it out of the case, which would just cause a ruckus.  With your bare hands, no gloves.  Yeah.  People would be like, what's he doing?  And then just take a lighter, hold it up with my right hand, and just in front of everyone, 
[00:08:00]  burn it.  That's what I think of this stupid card.  Oh, man.  Right.  Yeah, you gotta go see it.  He is a wacky-looking motherfucker, that Honus Wagner.  It's like the best one.  This is the Jumbo Wagner, which has larger borders than the other ones.  What do you mean a Jumbo Wagner?  It was miscut.  The borders are larger than the other ones.  So it's generally regarded as the best one, considering that the Gretzky 2206 is so controversial  because it was apparently cut from a printer's sheet. 
[00:08:30]  It's not really from a pen.  You know this stuff.  Oh, sure.  Wow.  This is the greatest baseball card.  Yeah, no, I know that much.  But I didn't know that there was a Jumbo one that's even more valuable.  Yes.  And that's the one that's on sale.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  So is anything on the back?  Sure.  The ad for whatever tobacco company.  Oh, the tobacco company.  Right.  Could they bring the card to us?  Sure.  Why do we have to go there? 
[00:09:00]  Just cart three million bucks around.  Why not?  You think there's security there?  I would think so, yeah.  Yeah.  You think they got a guard standing by?  It's cool.  They ought to have an epic fucking Atlanta Mall security guy there tasing people that come  from here.  I heard he got fired, that guy.  You heard that, right?  Yes.  He got the boot.  He got the boot.  Yeah.  This is a security guard.  Well, we said it weeks ago.  You can't be showing your dick like that on YouTube and expect the people that are paying 
[00:09:30]  you to not notice.  Yeah.  That caused all sorts of problems.  Yeah.  He had every right to do what he was doing, obviously, but you can't be all over YouTube  becoming a viral star.  Got to keep it on the QT.  You kind of had to.  There's no surprise here.  We all knew this was going to happen.  He was either going to get killed or be fired.  Which means that mall area is going to be just taken over now.  That's what he said.  That's what he said in a post-firing interview that he had.  He said, he goes, well, you know, it won't be long before people realize I'm not there 
[00:10:00]  and the drug dealers will all come back in.  Right.  You know, that place just looked like a Somali marketplace.  Well, I mean, you know, you just got to give up on some places.  Some places you do.  Just got to fucking cut your losses.  But that guy will get a good gig now.  Yeah, he probably will.  He's going to get a nice, nice, sweet gig, nice, easy gig.  I think he'll get something he likes in security where he can, you know,  flex his muscle like that and not worry.  No, you don't think so?  He's going to fucking chill, man. 
[00:10:30]  He's going to get a Segway.  Just kind of fucking right around.  Oh, you think he'll be at like a nice white mall?  Upper middle class mall.  He'll be at the fucking one there in Jersey.  Yes.  Which one?  Short Hills.  Short Hills Mall.  You think he'll be at the Short Hills Mall?  Short Hills Mall, right.  Hassling fucking like rich white shoppers.  Hey, what are you doing in my store?  I'm buying something.  Peacefully.  Oh, okay.  I don't know how to deal with this.  I'm watching the carousel at Roosevelt Field.  Yeah.  Making sure kids pay to get on. 
[00:11:00]  Somebody puts the fucking, the size, a medium back with the smalls and he tases them.  It's like the biggest crime he gets.  I'm happy that he got fired.  He's being laid off.  Yeah.  I'm happy he got fired because, you know, he was heading towards some bad times, man.  I think you're right.  I mean, that was going to catch up on him.  That place.  They did him a favor because now he'll go chill out for a little while and then he's going  to pop up somewhere.  He's going to have a nice, easy gig somewhere.  Absolutely.  He'll be like fucking Paul Blart, right? 
[00:11:30]  Just sitting there on the fucking Segway?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Going up and down the mall.  Sam, we're feeling a bit of a panic here because last Friday was Tequila and Donut Day  and now we sit here on this Friday.  People are expecting something.  Well, that's the problem with having a show as great as last week.  What are you going to do?  It's like, where do you go?  Where do you go?  Did the Opie and Anthony show hit a peak?  Not a peak.  I hope not is the thing.  I wouldn't think so.  We used to build Friday shows.  We've got to start building Friday shows again, which meant during the week if something 
[00:12:00]  kind of cool happened, a listener or somebody around here, then we would push them toward  a big Friday finale show.  Is this an initiative?  Yeah, we should.  We used to have a lot of fun with those Friday shows.  The Opie and Anthony Friday show initiative?  Yeah, and it was just a little thing.  It's like, oh, this guy's saying he can fucking sing just like Lane Staley.  All right, cool.  Let's bring him in for Friday's show.  Yep.  Should I go around and see if I can find talented people around here that have mystery  talents? 
[00:12:30]  Mystery talents.  Why don't we start today?  We should.  I mean, I think it'd be great.  If we're going to start the Friday show initiative, we could start today.  Yeah.  What does this place have to offer?  It could be anything.  Magic, singing prowess, juggling.  Well, if you remember Jose from the Metal Channel and all that, he could play a mean Metallica  on the acoustic guitar.  He could.  You know, so there might be some hidden talents out there.  Who are you going to start with?  Taylor from Cosmo?  I think she's got a lot to offer that is just not being exposed on that Cosmo channel. 
[00:13:00]  You think?  I think so.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, we got to try at least.  She's hiding it all in that ass.  That ass.  She regretted having the two shots of tequila last Friday.  Because I happened to take the elevator down with her last Friday.  Oh.  When she was going to L.A. for her, what, husband or, husband, right?  What's that chair?  Husband's marathon.  Yeah.  She was regretting it.  She had her sunglasses on.  She was like, why did I do that?  Was she already feeling it?  Oh, yeah.  What a bad idea. 
[00:13:30]  She was happy that she hung with us and stuff.  Right.  But she was not happy that she did the two shots of tequila knowing she had a really busy day.  She was also embarrassed with some of Anne's questioning.  She's very, I didn't know this, but she's very prudish.  She doesn't like talking about sexuality at all.  Well, I could tell that.  You weren't that bad, were you?  Not at all.  I just, you know, I was delving in to see what she was going to say.  But then when she said, no, that's not going to happen.  I'm not going to answer that.  Then, you know, I'm not going to push it.  Do you find it weird?  I mean, technically, this is a workplace. 
[00:14:00]  Uh-huh.  But we are allowed to just bring a girl in here and ask if they've ever taken it in the shitter.  As long as they...  Can you imagine being in a regular workplace?  It is odd, because as long as they come through that door and sit in front of a mic, we can do that.  You can't just walk out, walk up to somebody and go, hey, do you take it in the shitter?  What if we just walked around constantly with microphones in front of us?  That would be a gray area.  Yeah, that would be a gray area, I think.  We could just tell people we're still doing our show.  We're on the air. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, because if we asked the same question, a mere 10, 12 feet outside that glass, we'd  be in deep trouble.  Can you imagine going up to a desk and being like, oh, hey, oh, so you work for this show.  Oh, cool.  So does your husband, does he eat your box?  Right.  Does he eat your box?  What?  We really do.  Excuse me?  You're fired.  We really have strange jobs.  Yeah.  I know Denny wouldn't appreciate that we said we have jobs, but...  No, shit.  But for this discussion, it's just easier to say...  Not shift to show. 
[00:15:00]  Strange job.  You can't say job and you can't say shift.  I'm obsessed with Denny.  Show.  I'm obsessed with Denny.  Yes.  Everybody is.  They're saying he needs a Twitter.  Yeah.  Why isn't he on the Twitter?  He should have a goof Twitter, though.  You know how some people do the goof Twitter?  Yeah.  He should have a goof Twitter.  No, where it's just he just talks about, you know, old school radio.  But he would only talk about old school radio.  That would be his Twitter.  That would be his Twitter.  Okay, you're right.  Yeah.  He, uh...  Boy, he is amazing. 
[00:15:30]  Except we'll set up a goof Twitter for him, and then he'll set up an official one, and  he'll get verified before me, because we set up a goof one.  Of course.  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone, right?  DennisFalcone.com.  Please book him for some dumb, stupid fucking event.  Yeah.  Just create an event.  Please.  Just create something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I feel so bad for the guy.  But it says everything you need to know about the times we're living in, because everyone's  got those people at their workplace that are fucking major company people, and the company  don't give a fuck. 
[00:16:00]  They don't care.  Why doesn't that guy have a great gig here?  That's probably the best lesson I've learned, specifically from working on this show.  I mean, I got to...  I wasn't out of my 20s before I figured out the company guy thing does not work.  They don't even know he exists.  Nope.  The guys that make the real decisions around here have no idea Dennis Falcone exists.  Even though Dennis Falcone is out there pushing the company initiative every single day.  He's everything that is supposed to be on those Decades channels. 
[00:16:30]  And he is the perfect jock for the Decades channels.  The guys that do know who he exists are just like, oh, yeah, we can just throw it on Dennis.  Right.  We can just give it to stupid Dennis.  He'll take care of it.  Yeah.  It's not a young guy.  He's been around a while.  Around the block.  He's got college-age kids.  He's not...  There's fucking pictures of this video of him with Harry Harrison.  Come on.  Yeah, I would guess he's in his 50s, right?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So...  Oh, yeah.  And he's just still walking around with a clipboard hoping to get the call? 
[00:17:00]  Impressing people.  Yeah.  Yeah, still impressing people.  Still trying to impress someone.  He shouldn't have to be impressing people at this point in his career.  No.  He's been there.  He's been in the trenches.  I was thinking then, we've got to kind of arrest him because we're stupid.  We find something cool on the show and then we hammer it into the ground.  And then, you know, the listeners never want to hear from that person again.  It's partly our fault.  Yeah.  But I think we've got to get him to just do a DJ, like DJ the show. 
[00:17:30]  Come in here.  Like Drew Boogie.  Not taking Drew Boogie's fucking gig.  It would be a lot different than Drew Boogie.  I think it would be him.  But we set him up with his fucking hard drive of hits.  And he can fucking play some things here and there.  Maybe he can even play things at...  He can raise his hand as we're talking and go,  Oh, fuck, I've got a song that applies to this.  And then we go to him.  Yeah.  We've talked about doing like a big DJ show where throughout the show...  Well, I know the DJ off.  The DJ off, whatever it's called.  Right.  But this is a little different. 
[00:18:00]  Just give him the fucking spotlight.  And let him be the music man for the show.  Yeah, for a day.  See how it goes.  He's picking the hits as we talk.  And then he plays us in and out of breaks with some shit.  Yeah, I would like that.  He's going to talk over music, though.  He'd like music to be constantly playing.  That's fine.  But that could be the Friday initiative.  Yeah.  For today?  Well, I don't think he has the hard drive of hits and all that.  We're going to make it today.  Probably not.  And he's probably not in yet.  But maybe...  How about next Friday?  Next Friday we can make it any day. 
[00:18:30]  Wait, is next Friday Good Friday?  Oh, is it?  I don't know.  Is it?  Yeah.  Next Friday is Good Friday?  Good Friday.  I might take Good Friday off.  Ooh.  Well, to go to Boston and see Jimmy.  Next Friday.  I don't need the company paying for my shit.  I'm going to jump in my car.  Going to drive to Boston.  Head up there?  Yeah, see Jimmy do his thing.  And come home in time for Easter.  Because the company couldn't figure it out.  We should have been there.  We got that bus trip coming up.  Oh, the bus trip.  Yeah.  We got that coming up.  What's the latest on that? 
[00:19:00]  We're looking at mid-May, possibly June.  No.  No, I see.  It ain't June.  No, June.  Will you stop?  It ain't June.  Oh, all right.  It's not June.  The second Memorial Day hits, all bets off on this.  Yeah, there's pools to jump into.  Ain't going to happen.  There's oceans to jump into.  That's the deadline.  The summer has begun, yes.  That's it.  Yes.  That's called the Summer Initiative.  Very busy summers at my house.  Very busy.  Right.  Summers go quick.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  So the Summer Initiative is no big events.  Nope.  No.  Nope.  No.  The Friday Initiative is Friday shows.  I like the Friday Initiative.  I think we should start immediately.  Today's Hidden Talent Day.  Well, yeah.  We want to kick off Friday Initiative with something.  So you run around, see who's here, what they could do.  I don't care.  I don't care if it's a stupid human trick or whatever.  Anything.  Right.  And I'm going to look for people, too, that's not just the regular show hosts that have done  the show before.  Right.  I want people like Denny who are looking for that break who are like, are you kidding 
[00:20:00]  me?  I'm going to have an outlet to do this?  It's like on a show as big as this.  Right.  You know, the behind-the-scenes guys.  You know the dude that cleans the bathrooms?  Yeah.  And he's a very happy guy.  He's got the glasses.  This guy is so happy.  He really does love cleaning those bathrooms.  I look at him and I say to myself, what the fuck is wrong with you?  You've got a great gig and this guy who's scrubbing toilets couldn't be happier.  And he's not one of those slow ones.  Yep.  No.  Usually you give the bathroom job to a slow one. 
[00:20:30]  This guy isn't slow and he just loves being here.  I've talked to him.  He doesn't consider himself a bathroom cleaner.  What does he consider himself?  Filmmaker.  What?  Filmmaker?  What?  Yes.  What kind of films?  I don't know.  He explained to me one day that he is a filmmaker.  Wow.  And he was asking about the wire people coming in and everything because that's what he likes.  But he's a filmmaker.  All right.  Why is he cleaning bathrooms?  Well, film doesn't pay unless you're Spielberg.  That's true.  Spielberg's the only one making money.  Maybe it's research. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet you he has a hidden talent, though.  I bet you he has a voice like an angel.  Yeah.  He probably can sing.  I think he has a voice like an angel.  I don't know.  You're talking?  Yeah.  That's probably racial.  I just think he can sing because he's black and he cleans bathrooms.  That's terrible.  You shouldn't say that.  Oh, my.  That's racist.  I was leaving the black thing out of this.  No, I think that's why.  Even I was.  I was leaving it out of the discussion.  It's part of it.  Yeah.  We'll see what he can do.  Yeah.  The Friday initiative has begun.  Great.  We're bringing back the Friday shows. 
[00:21:30]  That would be nice.  And we'll start today.  Yeah.  Let's find us some talent.  Absolutely.  Let's do that.  And then if nothing pans out, maybe we'll just get the virus to do some comedy or something.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  That's kind of good.  Oh, God.  But anyway.  Yeah.  Iraq did his part, man.  Iraq turned into the virus on fucking last week.  Huh?  You know.  You know.  You're right.  Iraq did do his part.  He was.  And he's kind of graduated, I feel like, away from that because he's kind of the fucking  man now.  Yep.  For a little while.  Maybe it's time for somebody else to audition for the virus. 
[00:22:00]  I mean, there are guys here who haven't.  Don't even suggest self.  Oh, God.  I know where you're going.  No.  I liked it.  All right.  Not Sal.  Sal always puts me in a bad spot.  Where's that?  He comes in today to tell me his uncle's getting a brand new boat.  Oh.  And you know my hatred for Sal, but I'm like, fuck.  Fishing would be kind of cool.  Is it a fishing boat?  On a 30-footer.  Or a pleasure craft.  Pretty cool, huh?  He said he's getting a brand new boat, open invite, and I know you want to do some tuna 
[00:22:30]  fishing.  And I'm sitting there reading my papers going, fuck.  Yeah.  What a suck-up.  This guy is working me.  What is he doing?  I'm going to boot.  He tells you he's got a boat.  He got a gun.  And he talks to me about his gun.  I think he's just getting things so he can talk to us.  Right.  He's using that wealth of his because he doesn't need the money.  He just wants the gig.  To buy shit.  To buy shit.  So he can stay here.  So he can talk to people.  Because I know if I step on that boat and have a good time and go tuna fishing, then I can't 
[00:23:00]  hate the kid anymore.  See, that's just it.  What the fuck are you doing to me?  I think he wants me and him to go down to the range, too.  Blast off some shots.  And that way we can't, you know, once two men kind of, you know, bond over shooting guns,  you know.  Then next thing you know, you don't want to make the big trade that needs to be made.  Right.  Right.  He's pretty clever, but it's very transparent.  Yeah, but I'm getting weak.  Very transparent.  I'm getting weak.  Are you weakening?  Yeah, because I want to go tuna fishing.  Oh, boy. 
[00:23:30]  And the dude up there in Gloucester, I don't know, his boat sank, and he's trying to tell  me that his boat's going to be okay.  The wicked tuna guy?  Yeah, but I don't want to go on a boat of a guy who lost a boat last season.  Sal's uncle's boat is brand new floating.  Floating on the water.  Is it floating already?  Yeah, it's in South Jersey right now.  They're going out for sea trials and stuff like that in a couple weeks.  Sea trials?  Yeah.  What's sea trials?  Just to test it out and make sure everything's cool.  Just go out there and fucking open it up.  Not me.  We had family boats, you know, an uncle here, an uncle there. 
[00:24:00]  You bought it and you fucking went out on it.  Never our family, but they...  Yeah!  You loaded it up with beer and you fucking went out.  Sea trial.  What's a sea trial?  Captain, it's like a cruise ship.  You bought a boat and you hoped it lasted a couple weeks before your first engine problem.  Open it up, Captain.  Yeah.  You know, let's see what she's got.  What's sea trials?  Well, just, you know, test out the boat, make sure all the electronics are good.  Every...  They go over, like, literally everything.  What the fuck is electronics on a boat?  Would you ever have electronics on a boat, Ann? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, boy.  You got your fucking radar.  You always had those...  Radar, sonar, yeah.  It's a lot of expensive equipment you got there, Mr. Hooper.  North shore of Long Island with all those harbors and inlets and shit.  You just would hit stuff.  And then your uncle, with a beer in his hand, would go, ah, Dick, we're stuck.  Ah, we're trying to back out.  Dick, we're stuck.  And then he would jump off the back of the boat and he's only up to his knees.  I'm like, we couldn't figure this out before this happened?  Push it out.  Push it out.  Yeah.  Yeah, you didn't have things like depth finders and fucking... 
[00:25:00]  None of that shit.  All that fun.  You just had to kind of guess where all the rocks and shit were.  I remember, like, out there in Waiting River, because that's where we did a lot of our boating,  the uncles, you know, the info was passed down and they're like, yeah, I think some shit  is over here, so we're going to go wide.  But I'm not really sure.  Yeah.  You know.  Did he name his boat?  No.  Oh.  Now, he's bought...  Well, maybe it can be called the Opie.  No.  It's a few years old.  I think it's like an O3, but the guy, like, barely has used it.  It's pretty much just been sitting there. 
[00:25:30]  And there's a thing with when you change the name of a boat, it's bad luck if you don't  ask the owner and you have to officially own the boat.  There's all this, like, superstition and stuff like that when it comes to boating.  Yeah.  No, it's all stuff people made up because, you know, they have time to kill.  What if the boat is called, like, I'm a faggot?  You'd probably want to change that.  Yeah.  I think.  Or not.  Or not.  Right.  But, I mean, I've been fishing the whole life.  No, don't change it.  Fine.  It's bad luck.  He's trying everything he can to keep him from changing the name of the boat. 
[00:26:00]  It's like, it's such bad luck.  You know, I don't like it any more than you do, but you should keep it.  Imagine pulling it to Wash Hill with a boat that's named I'm a faggot.  I'm a faggot.  Wouldn't you just do that for the looks you would get every time?  Like, what?  What?  What?  People would give you plenty of room to back in, though.  Oh, yeah.  What do you get on a 30-foot boat?  In terms of what?  In terms of what do you get on a 30-foot boat? 
[00:26:30]  It's all right.  Well, you get engines.  You get electronics.  Like, can you sleep on the thing?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  That's what I mean.  Four bunks, I think.  But it's not like a bed.  It's like a bunk, you know.  You probably got the little bed thing in the bow.  And then you got the kitchen, the dining table thing, which comes out and folds down.  And then there's a little nook in one side where there's a couple of bunks in there.  And then Opie shows up and he's like, what do you mean? 
[00:27:00]  You said there were bunks on this.  And Sal's like, I was missing four.  I guess we'll just have to share.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Brother Wee's ruined boating for me.  I'd go up to Rochester.  And he had a huge fucking boat.  I had my own little, like, almost suite.  Oh.  And his suite was even bigger in the front of the boat.  AC, satellite TV everywhere.  And then we would take off for Canada, go across Lake Ontario.  We'd stop in the middle.  We would wine the whole way. 
[00:27:30]  Bottles of wine and just great music.  Like, he had the, he has the best CDs ever.  Does he have a hard drive of hits?  I think his hard drive of hits would definitely be better than Danny's hard drive of hits.  You know what?  Now you're just talking crazy.  Now this is crazy talk.  Compilation discs out the ass.  You don't think Danny has?  Out the ass.  Compilation discs.  No, because Danny has to go with the hits.  He doesn't like album cuts.  He doesn't like going deep.  That's true.  No, we've got, like, album cuts.  I like a good shallow fucking. 
[00:28:00]  And live cuts.  Shallow selection myself.  I'm not very deep as far as album cuts go.  You wouldn't dig a nice live Allman Brothers song?  I bet I would love Danny's hard drive.  Really?  And then we'd get the wine and you'd crank the tunes.  And then he had a spot in Canada where we were heading toward.  And then in the middle of Lake Ontario, we'd just stop the boat, turn off all the engines,  jump in for a little while.  Whoa.  Which was kind of creepy because you were convinced there were big, huge monsters under 
[00:28:30]  the water.  Well, you know why?  Because there are.  That's fucking a lot of water.  In the middle of Lake Ontario.  That's crazy.  Was it fresh water?  What goes on over there?  Fresh water.  That's fucking crazy.  Fresh water.  And you would jump off the boat and you would think, well, if I don't go too deep, then the  monsters really can't get me.  So you would try to get your dive to be very shallow.  Oh, my God.  It's like fucking Waterworld.  They got those giant sea worms or whatever the fuck they are.  I don't know what the fuck, but there's something about jumping in dark water that I've never  gotten over. 
[00:29:00]  Dude, and you know how deep it is and fucking, oh.  You're only going down maybe 10 feet.  Fresh water monsters.  It goes down hundreds of feet after, yeah.  And then you would pop up quickly because you felt safer with your head above the water.  Then you get that paranoid feeling like, yeah, something's after me.  And you're like swimming as fast as you can.  I don't even like going like waist deep in the ocean.  Oh, that's, that I can, you know.  Oh, God, if something touches my leg, I'm going to die.  But you just felt.  Yes.  But when you're in the middle of a lake and you want to swim around, you just always stayed 
[00:29:30]  kind of close to the boat.  You didn't really want to venture out.  What's that about?  When I was a kid going to Lake Ronkonkoma, it was scary enough.  Lake Ronkonkoma?  Lake Ronkonkoma.  It's fucking, first of all, you got no buoyancy from the water.  Like, there's no salt in the water.  So you always felt a little weird and heavier than you did in the ocean.  It's just odd.  And in the water, like you said, it's calm.  There's no waves.  And it's dark. 
[00:30:00]  You don't know what's under there.  Yes.  You got to tell yourself, you're in the middle of Lake Ontario.  There pretty much can't be anything near the surface.  Yeah.  Because I would think about seaweed vines and all that shit.  Dude.  Where I would get my leg caught or something.  Gary.  Oh, my God.  And then, of course, in Lake Ronkonkoma, there was supposedly, it was bottomless lake.  Oh, right.  The rumors about Lake Ronkonkoma were very funny.  Bottomless lake.  Bottomless lake.  The whirlpool.  Lady of the lake.  Lady of the lake.  Lady of the lake.  What's that?  And the dead kid, the boy that got sucked down, and it's like fucking Jason. 
[00:30:30]  Pirate Cove?  Pirate Cove.  How could a pirate ship get into a lake?  Yeah, right?  What the fuck?  What the fuck is that about?  There are many rumors about Lake Ronkonkoma.  Really?  Rumored to have no bottom.  No bottom.  Lake Ronkonkoma has deep depressions that seem to go on forever.  Sounds like this place, right, guys?  Ah, boy.  But why are they still rumors?  Can't we just go and...  I'm sure they've been disproven.  Okay.  You know what?  If you're going into fucking...  It's impossible for a human being to go all the way to the bottom unassisted, as the 
[00:31:00]  depressions are well in excess of 50 feet.  Yeah.  50 feet.  If you're fucking flying into MacArthur Airport, you look out the window, you see the bottom  of the lake, okay?  Right, right.  There's not fucking any...  A diving expedition in the early half of the 20th century revealed just how deep they go,  but myths continue to persist of the bottomless lake.  Bottomless lake.  Because it's a funny story.  I drove by Lake Ronkonkoma.  Lake Ronkonkoma.  About a year or two ago?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I was out east.  I'm like, oh, fuck you.  I want to check out Lake Ronkonkoma. 
[00:31:30]  It's a shithole now.  It is a ghetto.  What?  Didn't it used to be really nice?  Well, it was a place that a lot of the suburbanites used to go to.  If you didn't go to Jones Beach or Fire Island or anything like that, yeah, you'd go to Lake  Ronkonkoma with your family.  It didn't look too pleasing at all.  We used to go all the time.  I'd go to the beach.  I'd sit there and listen to my mom and dad yell at each other on the blanket, on the fucking  dirty sand, because it's not a beach.  They have the dirty sand, right? 
[00:32:00]  It's not a fucking beach, because a beach takes ocean waves smashing against the shore  to grind up the fucking sand over billions of years.  Lake Ronkonkoma, it's dirt into a lake.  It's fucking dirt.  So you're laying on dirt.  Can I say something?  Yeah.  Ocean sand just amazes me.  How is it the same fucking color for miles and miles?  It's great.  It's just amazing.  It's all those little seashells and fucking coral and fucking rocks. 
[00:32:30]  It's an amazing process.  It's just amazing.  And then you dig, and it's like it's still the same.  It's still there.  It's just amazing.  You know how long it took for the ocean to grind away, the wind and water to grind away  at that shit?  And it takes care of itself, because you could back up a dump truck and dump horrible dirt  on sand.  It'll be gone.  A mere week. 
[00:33:00]  It's gone.  Like, where does it go?  I don't get it either.  The beach is amazing.  The sand is just amazing.  Opie really likes that.  Remember when he went into his whole thing about how water was amazing?  And now sand is amazing.  So Opie, the beach itself is quite amazing.  You continue mocking, but I got people on that water thing.  They rape me all the time.  I was fucking amazed by water.  They're like, wait, at first, you know, you sound like a complete idiot, but kind of sat  back one day and started thinking about water, and it is pretty amazing, if you really think 
[00:33:30]  about it.  What is that stuff?  It's not as solid.  It's amazing.  You throw it in, and it pretty much disappears.  Yeah, it just goes away.  This looks like a terrible place to go.  Ronkonkoma?  It is horrible.  It used to be a spot, though.  It was a garden spot of Long Island.  They used to keep it nice and clean, and the black and white pictures, you have to  go back to black and white pictures to see how nice it used to be.  That's exactly what you do. 
[00:34:00]  In the 80s?  It's terrible.  This doesn't look like it.  It's so fun.  Yeah, this was a child of the 80s stuff.  Yeah, 80s, huh?  To take a trip to Lake Ronkonkoma.  It might have been a little earlier for me.  We never went to Lake Ronkonkoma because we had the nice beach house in Waiting River,  my grandma's house.  Lake Ronkonkoma, I've told the story, it's the first place I ever went underwater.  Really?  Yeah, I held my breath and went underwater, and I was so excited, I wanted to show my  parents, so I made them stop yelling at each other for a second with me crying, watch 
[00:34:30]  me, watch me, watch me, watch me.  And then I ran to the lake because I was so excited, and right before I got to the water,  I tripped and face-planted into the sand.  Come on.  I did.  And I just started crying, and my dad called me an asshole.  The end.  I know it's a great bit, but did he really just call your names all the time?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like that.  Sometimes it was more loving than others.  Right.  But, um...  Hold on, Sal.  We're going back to you, you fucking impatient fuck.  Don't bust my chops. 
[00:35:00]  You see, Sal, we're in the middle of a bit.  You don't even know when we're in the middle of a bit.  I don't want to disturb you guys.  We bring it all back around.  Don't worry.  We got this.  While the fucking on-air light is still on?  Right.  Did you listen to fucking Denny?  It makes feedback.  I got to finish my brother-wee story, then we're going to get back to your 30-foot boat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn.  And then we would pull into...  I want to remember some of the places in Canada, these little towns that he knew.  And then everyone was cool.  Everyone's just in that fucking...  Very nautical town. 
[00:35:30]  It's kind of like Watch Hill, because I've gone to Watch Hill with you a few times.  You're in the boating community, and everyone's cool.  Oh, they want to help you out, and they kind of march back and forth, seeing what everyone's up to.  You're never needing of anything when you're in those little boat communities.  Right.  Because if you're like, oh, I forgot this or that, somebody will have it and be happy  to fucking bring it over and give it to you.  But you feel like you're part of something.  You feel like you're part of society.  Like, God forbid we do this when we're just walking about. 
[00:36:00]  I love it.  But you get into a little docking area for fucking boating, and everyone's just so friendly.  Everyone's drinking, laughing, playing music.  They invite you on their boat, you invite them on your boat.  Oh, yeah.  You share a little of this, you share a little of that.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'd stay there for, I don't know, a day or two, and then we'd tool back to Rochester  in time for some just cool fucking, you know, show, some concert, some outdoor show that  they were doing in Rochester.  But we didn't have time, so we'd stop in the middle of the lake again, Lake Ontario, with 
[00:36:30]  the shampoo.  What?  And jump in and fucking clean up.  Wow.  Because it is fresh water.  And you'd feel pretty squeaky clean.  Would you?  By the time you got back into Rochester, and then you'd go to a show.  Oh, my God.  What if you got soap in your eyes?  Now you can't open your eyes, and you're in the fucking monster water?  Holy shit.  Was it cold as fuck?  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah, it was.  It must have been.  It was, yeah.  It was doable, though.  I bet that water's fucking cold.  It would be the middle of the summer. 
[00:37:00]  It would be, you know, late July, August type.  Wow.  It was mostly when we went.  Damn.  I would never get out of that boat.  Oh, would I never get out?  Well, then he had, the coolest thing was, he had jet skis, and we went to-  I like those.  We went to Thousand Islands once, or whatever the hell it's called.  Yeah, it's a dressing place.  It's a dressing place.  And I would take the jet ski while everyone's just chilling.  You know, in Canada there, and just check out some of the islands.  It's amazing.  That is fun, man. 
[00:37:30]  On a jet ski.  Yeah.  And then they had little, tiny little islands that they just deemed parks, so then you just  park your jet ski and fucking check that out.  Was there a big gnat problem?  I don't like gnats, I'll tell you that.  The gnats could ruin everything.  You'd take your jet ski and go to those little secluded islands, which is cool.  You're like an explorer.  Right.  And then you get off and you're like, oh, let me look at that, that, and you're fucking  just gnats.  No, man.  Or like, holy shit, we haven't seen a living thing in a while. 
[00:38:00]  This is great.  Let's swarm him.  I miss my boat trips with Brother Weez, but now he's got a really nice cottage up there  on Sotus Bay, which is its own cool thing.  Ooh.  But these islands, I mean, I don't even know how they did it back in the day, but they're  people...  There's a house built on an island that's just as big as a house.  Yeah.  People just decided to take over these islands a long time ago.  That's a big island, man.  Whoa.  That's cool.  There are islands, like Ant just said, it's just a house and barely a yard, because that's  all you got left on your little island. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  And it would be your own little island.  How do you buy them?  I don't know.  Maybe they pass down from generation to generation.  Oh, yeah.  This has to go way the fuck back, and then, of course, you have to have your boat to go  to the mainland to get your shit.  Oh, yeah.  You couldn't really, you know...  You were secluded, but some of these spreads these people had were amazing.  I would hold horrid experiments on the island.  Tiny, tiny little island?  Like Dr. Moreau.  Yes.  And then we would head back to Rochester.  It's a long boat ride. 
[00:39:00]  And I go, yo, Wheeze, can I just take your jet ski?  He goes, yeah.  So I would just follow the boat for like an hour or two.  Just a week jumping?  But then I would let him go with his boat, so now I just feel like I'm in the middle of  nowhere on a jet ski.  Ah!  But it was cool as hell, man.  That is cool.  It was peaceful.  That's a lot of fun.  Yeah, I really do.  You live in these houses?  Huh?  People live in these houses?  Yeah.  I would assume.  What do you think?  They just build them to keep there for its decoration?  Well, I mean, like, you know, like permanently, like year-round.  Oh, that would probably be cool. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  I would assume some.  I would assume some people do, and then, you know, a lot of them are probably summer  homes, but they, I mean, I can't even explain how small these islands are.  What are they?  Huh?  That's so cool.  The island is literally, if you had a plot of property here that was no more than an  acre, or even three-quarter acre with a house on it, it's like that, but plopped  in the middle of the fucking lake.  Yeah, that's the whole island.  Lake.  It's the whole island.  It's one house with the front yard, backyard, and that's it.  Yeah, and every, I mean.  Like, you walk off your property, and you're falling into the ocean. 
[00:40:00]  Look at this guy.  That guy doesn't even have.  Look at this guy.  He has a tree, a house, and if he steps more than five steps, he's in the water.  He's got a tree and a house.  Yeah, the Thousand Islands is just pretty amazing to just check out.  This is incredible.  What?  That's amazing.  There's a castle on that one.  Yeah, there's a...  Yeah.  That's...  Isn't it wild?  Look at that guy.  All right, that's just stupid.  Look at that guy.  You walk out your front door, you're in the water.  That's stupid.  You think the guys in the castle make fun of this guy? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, they hate him.  There goes the neighborhood.  Yeah, that's weird.  Isn't it wild, though?  Well, without tides, I guess they're okay.  Without a tidal fucking...  Well, what is it?  The St. Lawrence River?  Is that where all that shit is?  Is that in it?  I don't know.  It's been a while.  I don't remember now.  We haven't done a boat trip in about eight years now, unfortunately.  Do you get to, like, name your island, I guess?  Yeah, I guess.  I'd name it something horrible.  Very politically incorrect.  People wouldn't want to go to it because they wouldn't say it. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  So, Sal, back to your dumb boat.  Your uncle's boat.  Yes.  Should I go fishing?  It's fun.  Yeah, but the Wicked Tuna guys are going to get pissed.  Because I've got two Wicked Tuna guys that are more than willing to, you know, take me tuna fishing.  Yeah.  It's far away, though, right?  It's up in...  Oh, God forbid.  I drive somewhere.  Is it okay with you?  Is it okay to...  Why drive somewhere?  Staten Island isn't a fucking easy trip, either. 
[00:41:30]  So, it's just...  It's your uncle's boat.  Yeah, it's not mine.  So, how often do you say you're going to be out on this thing?  Usually, like, in the summer, I'm usually fishing between, like, two and three times a week.  And where do you go?  We fish a lot of Raritan Bay, which is, like, Brooklyn, Verrazano, and being enclosed by there, like, Jersey.  Great water.  Yeah.  Like, some of the best striper fishing in the world.  Stripers?  Yeah, striper.  Go for stripers?  I don't want to go striper fishing. 
[00:42:00]  I want to go tuna fishing.  There's, like, what's known as the...  This is pretty gay sounding, but the Mud Hole.  Is that a bar you go to after you're fucking done?  The Mud Hole.  The Mud Hole.  Oh, shit.  Let's book a gig at the Mud Hole for Denny.  You would go to the Mud Hole.  Denny!  We got a gig for you.  I think in, like, the 30s and the 40s, they would just dump all of New York City's garbage there.  They would drive it out about, like, I think it's like 15 miles or so. 
[00:42:30]  And then there's the Canyons, which everyone knows.  Canyons, Mud Hole.  I love seeing a fucking trend here.  Canyons are bluefin tuna.  You can probably land any sort of red snapper.  Grouper.  Landing.  Yeah.  Grouper.  Yeah.  Grouper's are fucking big.  Yeah.  You know who's going to be really upset if you do this tuna fishing thing and it works  out?  Wait, wait.  Travis is obsessed with the houses.  It's just...  I've never seen it.  It's awesome.  You've never seen this, huh?  No.  That's retarded.  That is literally a house in the water.  Yeah.  That looks like a houseboat now. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Well, they wanted to expand their house and said, fuck it.  We don't need a yard.  So you're right.  We're looking at a house that there's no...  You can't step outside it, I don't think.  No.  You pull your boat right up to the front door.  There's a guy sitting out there.  That's it.  But how much fun would that be?  I don't know.  Maybe 10 minutes and then you're like, I'm in a house in the middle of fucking water.  All right.  Here's the thing.  We're not doing well in a storm.  Here is the dumb question of the day.  I'm going to acknowledge this.  How the fuck do you get electricity? 
[00:43:30]  How does that work?  I really don't know.  How does that work?  Wow.  Generators?  There could be a generator.  Because these houses look like they're, you know, they're not going to just sit there  without AC and without a TV.  And you can't just run underwater fucking cables to your own house.  We're obviously seeing no wires.  I see no wires.  There's no...  It has to be generators.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But before generators, they probably just said, fuck it.  We don't need... 
[00:44:00]  We just...  We had lanterns.  Oh, my God.  That would...  Little house on the prairie shit.  Underwater cables.  Are there...  Problems with underwater cable cuts power to 1,000 islands?  Yeah.  That's the headline of an article.  They actually do have underwater cables?  They figure that out?  I guess so.  I mean, I knew they had underwater power cables, but it just seems you'd need a lot of them  to get to each and every fucking island.  That would be a nightmare.  Imagine that's your job to sit up the underwater cables.  Sit up all those fucking cables.  That's crazy. 
[00:44:30]  There's a 3,140-meter underwater power cable that connects the district.  What do you tap into it?  I guess so, because everyone in this article from five years ago or four years ago, everyone  was without power.  Hey, we got 1,000 islands people checking in.  I knew this would happen.  Let's say hi to Chris and Buffalo.  Chris.  Power only arrived in 2008.  Hey, I lived in Buffalo in Watertown for about five years.  Yeah, the water power cables are all underwater. 
[00:45:00]  They have to pay for it individually.  They went to the sewer lines.  They have to pay for it.  Water is like 99.9% pure, so they don't need that.  If they don't pay for the sewer lines, they have to have chemical toilets.  They can't because it's all underwater.  Yeah, you can't dump it.  And like Heart Island, in the shape of a heart, is completely man-made.  The guy made it for his lover, and then she jilted him.  Oh, yeah, remember Heart Island.  Yeah.  No, it's bizarre.  You have all these little islands and these houses on them, man, and the water is ridiculously pure. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  Yeah, it's almost crystal clear.  It's unbelievable.  That's crazy.  I don't know how they are able to keep the pollution out of that, considering all the houses around there.  You'd think.  The algae grows upriver.  And?  Yeah.  Boy, he put the brakes on everything with that.  We weren't prepared to talk about algae today.  I didn't know about the algae.  I'm going to Google it, though, so I'm in on this.  All right, man.  Thanks, Chris.  All right, buddy.  Yeah, the Heart Island. 
[00:46:00]  So, I guess the South Thousand Islands rely on underwater power cables, and North Thousand  Islands, which is home to 15,000 people, have always relied on diesel-powered generators.  That's crazy.  You're talking, then, it's 2,000 islands.  Yeah.  Or is it the South 500 and the North 500?  And are they fighting?  Are they fighting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Civil War.  I would.  Diesel generators, eh?  Let's go to Stu in Albany.  Stu. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I have an uncle who owns an island right outside Alexandria Bay.  Yeah, well, Sal's got an uncle with a boat who gives a shit.  And the worst thing is, if you have to do what you work in the house, bring anything in,  you have to wait for the wintertime and bring it out over the ice.  Yeah.  Yeah, the whole thing freezes nice.  So, then, all of a sudden, you're not an island anymore.  No, you're on the ice.  You can finally say hi to your neighbor.  That's crazy living.  Let's just call and get a pizza.  It is.  Yeah.  You're even taking the garbage out at night.  You're going to put it in a boat and take it back into town. 
[00:47:00]  It's a pain in the ass.  Yeah, it's like a big pain in the ass.  I would have a garbage room.  Would you?  Yeah, fuck.  Just a disgusting mess.  And then once a month, I'd fucking clean out my garbage room.  I'm not taking out the garbage every day if I live on an island.  That's true.  I just throw it in the water.  Right.  Could you set up cannons and stuff?  Appreciate it.  Set up some cannons.  Just start taking out your neighbor.  Yeah, just fucking start, like, some ancient type of war.  Can you imagine you're just, what are you going to do?  Can you imagine you're just, it's my fucking island? 
[00:47:30]  A dickhead with a cannon and you're fucking blowing holes in you.  Boom.  Oh, he's firing his fucking cannon again.  He must be drunk.  How great would you be?  That would be so much fun.  Yeah.  I liked it.  Why is that guy bringing a cannon over to his house?  Yeah.  This river went on forever with the islands.  I only went, I don't know, I went in a couple miles, maybe.  We were docked pretty close at the time.  Amazing.  Yeah.  I never saw anything like this in my life. 
[00:48:00]  I was blown away by it.  Just blown away by it.  There's a thousand islands and almost every island has a house on it.  There's more than a thousand islands, by the way.  Yeah.  Thousand islands.  I think they just called it that because it's like, they couldn't call it, holy fuck, there's a lot of islands.  I live on, in holy fuck, there's a lot of islands.  They had to pick a number.  This guy has a grandfather or something.  I never really had a grandfather, so stop rubbing it in, Ron. 
[00:48:30]  Ron.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, my grandpa used to own that hard island.  And we used to get there by space when I was a kid.  You used to get there by what?  Space?  I think he said he used to get there by space.  By space.  And then he hung up.  It's an odd way to do it.  Well, he just gave out a secret and someone obviously took him out because he's gone.  Yeah.  Sam.  I didn't want that secret out.  Friday Initiative. 
[00:49:00]  How are we doing?  So far, not a lot of talented people have arrived.  How about we start with Chris?  Look, he's panicking.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  You gotta have some kind of secret talent.  I'm sure he does.  He's a very jovial, friendly guy.  My grandpa took me to the track once.  Nice.  Yeah, took me to the track once.  And then when we were going home, I sat in the back seat and I put my feet up on the seat  to go to sleep because I was tired and he yelled at me.  Why?  Because I had my feet up on his seat of his car. 
[00:49:30]  So he yelled at me and I felt all bad for like the entire rest of the day because grandpa  never yelled at me, but he never really talked to me either.  Right.  And the first thing he did was yell at me.  So I was like, fuck, man.  I got grandpa mad at me.  I think I might have.  You're one of those kids that would have done really well if you were abducted.  Maybe.  I think you would have had a better life if someone just abducted you.  And I just turn up years later, much better off.  People who live on the water use dirty generators, but it can't have a clean one. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, I'm trying.  I got my generator came in.  It's I'm now waiting on permits.  Right.  But you own your house.  Can't you just put your generator in?  It's America, right?  Right.  We're free to do that.  It's my house.  I bought it.  I should just be able to plop a fucking permanent full home generator there.  No.  Land of the free, right?  Oh, land of the free.  We all learned that.  Exactly.  So now my generator is all paid for, yet it's sitting in a garage somewhere while they wait 
[00:50:30]  for permits, because there's also a 1,000-gallon liquid propane tank that must be buried in  my yard, and that takes a permit.  And then you've got to get inspectors in there to inspect all the lines and the electricity  and everything.  And every time you do this, you've got to peel off some more hundies.  You've got to peel them off and fork it over to these fucking people.  I mean, I understand it is pretty much a freight train car that's being buried in my backyard. 
[00:51:00]  But, you know, it is my fucking backyard.  You can do whatever the hell you want.  I should be able to do whatever the hell I want.  Let the record show that we forced Sal to stand there for 20 minutes.  For his fucking three seconds of talking about his uncle's faggot boat.  I just used you to move on to the Brother Wheeze and the Thousand Islands stories.  Yeah.  How does it feel to be a segue?  It's okay.  Yeah.  I did like the mud hole.  You don't think you're going to end up being friends with him via brown nosing? 
[00:51:30]  I'm feeling a little weak because I do want to get on some boats this summer.  Because, I mean, the person who this will really affect is the guy who's been working  for like nine years trying to brown nose you into a friendship.  Oh, boy.  Well, he's doing it through hardware.  Who are you talking about?  Mars.  Poor Mars.  Oh, I forgot about Mars.  He's been brown nosing.  He's been trying to do everything.  He's been like, oh, I don't want to go fishing off the FDR. 
[00:52:00]  Are you going to take that jacket?  I don't want to go fishing off the FDR for whatever the hell they try to catch in the  East River.  And I can't go shooting with illegal guns.  Right.  Exactly.  Poor Mars.  Remember the time he asked you for your jacket?  Because he thought if you guys had the same jacket, it would be a bond?  Yeah.  What is he going steady?  The Letterman jacket?  I swear to you.  Did I ever give him a jacket?  Yeah, you did.  I swear to you, I don't remember this.  Wow.  Did I really?  You gave him your jacket.  I do remember that.  Yep, you did. 
[00:52:30]  It made nothing to you, I guess.  I must be rich.  I got everything to Mars.  Yeah, you are.  I must be rich.  I didn't even know.  He still wears it, I bet.  I bet he has it hanging in his coat and he smells it like in fucking...  What was that movie?  A white female.  Gay cowboy movie.  Oh.  Brokeback?  Yeah, Brokeback Mountain.  And at the end, he's fucking got his dead lover's shirt in the closet and he just fucking  smells it and cries occasionally.  Is that movie worth seeing?  I've never seen that movie.  Not really.  It's an alright movie. 
[00:53:00]  Fucking asshole.  It's a love story, but there's two guys.  Yeah.  It's not terrible.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  They hang out at the mud hole.  So who's going to be on this boat if I go?  It's usually me, my uncle, my uncle's friend, and my neighbor from back home.  It's like we have a crew.  It's not like you could just go out on an overnight...  Bros?  Wait, we're doing an overnight trip?  Well, we could.  Oh.  But it's usually...  How about a three-hour tour, Gilligan?  You want to do that? 
[00:53:30]  I mean, it usually takes...  To get to the canyon, it takes a couple hours to even get out there.  So then you want to fish for a few hours and then...  Jesus.  This is what I want to do.  Yeah, and I don't think you can help me.  But if you want to come, we would make arrangements according to you.  Oh, anything you need.  Anything you want.  Eric is convinced that this is a big plot to kill Hopi.  Oh, man.  Like fucking big pussy.  That's exactly what he said.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Oh, man.  Iraq's just laughing.  Iraq, you don't want to go out on a boat from Staten Island with a bunch of Italians.  I know. 
[00:54:00]  You're right.  Yeah.  And then they want to conveniently take me where they used to dump garbage.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  You know what I...  This is what I want to do this summer.  I want to go up the Hudson River badly.  How do I get that done?  Up the Hudson River.  Well, you could go with Louis C.K.  I know.  But his boat gets stuck.  Stuck in the muck.  Is there even, like, tours that take you up the Hudson River?  Yeah.  What do they got?  Circle line.  I want to do, like, a two-day or three-day-er. 
[00:54:30]  Alone or with people?  I want to go all the way, and then I'll fucking drive home.  Oh, like what?  Up the...  Just want to check it out.  Past the old Tappan Z and shit like that?  Boy, I want to go up the Hudson River, man.  I don't know why, but I do.  There's got to be, like, some kind of, like, overnight tour.  Find a Northwest Passage?  That would be nice.  Northeast Passage?  Sure.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  Overnight trips.  Overnight trips.  Overnight trips, and then what?  They bus you home?  Oh, that's what you want to be on.  One of those fucking death buses. 
[00:55:00]  The guy getting lulled to sleep by diesel noise.  And the diesel fuel.  The tires and the fumes.  The fumes, right.  There's a bunch of different kinds of trips.  Really?  Yeah.  I would like to do that this summer.  There's the Hudson Valley Sampler.  It's two days, one night.  You could charter a boat.  Two days, one night.  You should just charter a boat.  I don't really know how.  Have a captain.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, you look for boat charters up the Hudson or some shit.  I'm sure it'll be more fun than going fucking at Captain Dago. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I've driven boats over the years.  A bunch of old racial women.  Yeah.  But not enough to fucking trust myself.  How many times did the end bomb get thrown out on that boat?  A few.  A few.  Maybe I should go with you.  So that's why you're, you know, not telling your family to not open-minded?  Dude, I was right there.  I thought the exact same thing.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't let us stand eventually.  What, um...  Now, uh, about your bribe for me.  Uh, are there ranges here in New York City that you, uh, looking at? 
[00:56:00]  Uh, I used to go to the one in Huntington before it closed down.  Well, yeah, that was gone for years.  That was, like, the closest one.  On Spagnoli.  That's gone, though.  There was a gun range on, in Huntington?  Yeah, on Spagnoli Road.  It was, uh...  No kidding.  Yeah, right by where they flew those RC planes and shit like that.  Yeah.  And they closed that fucker down.  Mm-hmm.  That was a strict range, though.  It was barely any fun.  I think they had, like, 100 yards at the most.  Yeah, it was really small.  And the fucking range guys there were real hard asses. 
[00:56:30]  They were just like, fuck you.  They had all the New York City assholes coming through there and just...  Yeah, yeah.  Being obnoxious.  But...  What about city ranges?  I've never been to a New York City range.  I've never been to Bay Ridge.  Really?  I could have sworn when I was living there, there was one, like, underground, like...  I don't know.  Any, uh, cops out there or whatever, get in touch with me.  I want to fucking fire off some rounds in the city.  Wow.  Without doing it on the streets.  You know?  Yeah.  I know a guy.  Yeah?  You know a guy?  Oh.  Yeah, there's one.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Bay Ridge Rod and Gun Club.  You go in there with a big hard-on and your gun.  And then there was another one.  It was a military base in South Jersey.  That was, like, fucking far, though.  That was, like, two hours.  Fascinating.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  I don't know.  It doesn't look like we're going fucking shooting.  Oh, you have to be a member of the club.  He's just listing gun ranges now.  Yeah.  But Anthony...  We have an international audience.  I'd go, but...  You can mention a gun range, but then you have to have a gun.  You have to have some kind of, like, little story or antidote about it. 
[00:57:30]  You've got to add a little pizzazz.  And then some dude in Ireland is like, oh, wow, that's kind of cool.  I've been shooting since I was young.  Oh.  It's not...  You're making it seem earlier that, like, I was doing these things to bomb with you guys.  I've shot since I was done.  Oh.  I fished my whole life.  No, we were just making a dumb joke.  He fished his whole life, and he's been shooting for forever.  Amazing.  We're just getting back into it, coincidentally.  That's all.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, that's all.  My parents wouldn't let me get a gun when I was home, so once I moved out...  Not till you're 12, son.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:58:00]  They wouldn't let you, huh?  No.  So as soon as I moved out, I started getting all my things together and legally got a gun.  Nice.  Now, we're starting the Friday initiative.  Do you have a hidden talent you could start off on our show?  Hmm.  Anything.  If it's doing his job, he's been hiding it very well.  Anything.  Anything.  I can't think of anything right now, but maybe a little bit.  I'll try to think of something.  Oh, Jesus.  This is going to be a bust, Sam.  Well, see, his correct response was, you know what?  I have something. 
[00:58:30]  I don't want to reveal it right now.  After the break, we'll do it.  And that would have gotten a, whoa!  And then we would have been like, I wasn't going to Eric Nagel this, but...  What does that mean?  Iraq, you hear that?  You hear that, Iraq?  Yeah, yeah.  The king of Fridays, Eric Nagel.  Doing an amazing job.  What do you mean by that?  Meaning that I wouldn't create a vague statement just to lead up to...  Oh.  So once again, I was thinking about you.  Oh.  I really was.  And I'm going to tell you this.  You were a pussy last Friday and wouldn't do any tequila shots, okay?  Sure.  Denny, out of nowhere, does two shots, three shots, and it's like, yeah, I'll do it, you 
[00:59:00]  guys.  Now, Denny is a massive fucking star right now on this radio show.  See, that's where this stuff leads to.  Star of the show.  Star of the show.  My talents are music, so I mean, that's...  Can you sing?  I can't sing.  I can play drums.  Drums is my primary instrument.  All right, let's get some drums in here.  I'm totally done.  Get some drums in here, up in this bitch, and let him fucking play some drums.  Way better than Justin Bieber?  Way better than Justin Bieber.  That's pretty good.  Do we have a drum set around here?  That's good enough to start off the Friday initiative. 
[00:59:30]  I've seen some shit around this jernt.  In the fucking big studio, down the hall.  You get them to bring it in here.  How long have you been playing drums?  I started playing when I was like nine or so.  Oh.  So let's get some spackle buckets.  That's all you need?  Yeah.  Spackle buckets.  No, if you're a good drummer, you can fucking get something done.  Do it?  Drum sticks?  Yeah.  Should have brought in my digital drum set from when I was a kid.  Oh, come on.  You won that on Nickelodeon.  You flipped the fucking quarters off your ankle.  I ended up watching that video yesterday, too, and I noticed one thing. 
[01:00:00]  Oh?  You were not happy when they gave the basketball hoop.  No.  You know what happened to that back?  You didn't give a fuck that they just gave a...  To me, I'm like, little kid wins a basketball hoop.  That's kind of cool.  Sam's fucking reaction was horrendous.  Because they used to give kids Jeffrey dollars.  Oh, man.  And I wanted Jeffrey dollars.  Toys R Us.  What am I going to do with a basketball hoop?  Not get a basket in there?  You got shitty prizes, by the way.  And...  What was the first one?  What?  You win a trip to fucking Vermont? 
[01:00:30]  I'm from New York.  Why would you give me a trip to Vermont?  Smuggler's Notch.  Who cares?  Smuggler's Notch.  Smuggler's Notch.  I wasn't interested.  And I finally watched the whole thing.  I have a few more observations.  You did?  What was the lady's name?  Summer Sanders.  Summer Sanders hated that she was the host of that show.  Really?  She couldn't make it more obvious.  She loved touching you, though.  Yeah.  She fucking hated that she was the host of that show.  Why do you say that?  You could just tell.  Look at Sam. 
[01:01:00]  Look at little Sammy Roberts.  Sam just posted this on his YouTube channel.  It was hilarious.  Figure it out.  It was called Figure It Out.  Sam was on it.  Do you know how old I was in that clip?  Did you see when I said it?  You were 20.  No?  14.  Yeah.  You look like you're 10.  I know.  If that.  You look 10.  If that.  But she fucking hated hosting this show.  What did she go on to do?  Well, she was a gold medalist.  Yeah.  In what?  Swimming.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she did this, and then she did a show on NBC about basketball, some NBA show. 
[01:01:30]  Do you know Michelle Trachtenberg was also in Pete and Pete?  And Harriet the Spy.  And then Celebrity Apprentice, Summer Senators.  I hated your ridiculously confident wave to the audience, too.  It drove me nuts.  Yeah.  They announce you, and you're just like, hey, like you're Don Rickles going out on The Tonight Show.  And you're mugging for the camera.  Who are they all here to see, everybody?  Your confident wave drove me nuts.  Did you have braces?  Yeah.  Okay.  All the features. 
[01:02:00]  What a goofy little fuck.  Wait till you see my talent, everybody.  Hello.  Oh, boy.  What a who-gives-a-shit talent.  Did you have braces?  No.  Yeah, rich kids got the braces.  No.  No, everybody had braces.  I didn't get braces.  And look, they're still fucking crooked.  We just had a deal.  I don't know.  Maybe it was different when you guys were growing up.  Oh, back in the day.  Yeah.  My family just ignored we might have crooked teeth in our family.  In this era.  There was too much of an expense.  Most kids had braces.  Who knew she'd grow up to be a fucking babe? 
[01:02:30]  You did?  Yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah, Michelle Trankenberg.  She's fucking incredibly hot now.  I know.  Fucking sick.  I saw her over at the Time Warner building once.  Right.  Fucking smoking.  And Lori Beth Denberg, too.  Who?  Who?  The big fat girl from all that.  Oh, she is fucking big.  What is she doing now?  She's just now, she's a very fat actress.  Oh, she does things, though?  Not really.  Not really.  She was in Dodgeball as the very fat girl. 
[01:03:00]  She was in an episode of Workaholics.  And Little Pete.  She played very fat girl.  Yeah, yeah.  What's Little Pete doing these days?  He's texting me because he saw that I tweeted the link.  Who's Little Pete?  From Pete and Pete.  Danny Tamberelli.  Who?  From Pete and Pete.  The red-headed kid right here.  Oh, he's actually doing stuff?  No, no.  He's like, he's texting me.  Texting Sam.  Why?  Because he saw that I posted this on Twitter.  But he's not in the business?  I mean, I guess.  He does Pete and Pete reunions.  He does sketch comedy.  I've seen him on Funny or Die.  I saw that fucking Pete and Pete reunion thing, which was pretty funny. 
[01:03:30]  Pretty funny.  No, he's heading towards an appearance on the after show next week, so.  Wow.  You know.  Getting some Pete and Pete fucking, some Pete and Pete heat.  Yeah.  What about Big Pete?  Big Pete's done a couple things.  Yeah, he's actually, yeah.  He's.  But I mean, are you going to get him on your show?  You think you're going to get him?  I don't have a relationship with Big Pete.  Only Little Pete.  Well, maybe Little Pete could turn you on to Big Pete.  I would love to hang out with the Pete's.  Both Pete's.  Yeah.  Both Pete's.  And Artie.  Yeah.  A.K.A.  The Wiz.  The Wiz.  The Wiz.  The Wiz from fucking Seinfeld. 
[01:04:00]  Of course.  I'm the Wiz.  Endless Mike.  We got a break.  We do have to break.  Yeah.  I figured out when Sam Roberts, this show figured out, Sam Roberts posted it on his  YouTube channel.  It's on our Facebook, too.  And on our Facebook page, which is Opie and Anthony.  Like us.  You look lost.  I was nervous.  When you're not nervously mugging for the camera, you're just kind of staring off and  looking around the studio.  You look at Summer a few times like, help me.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that where it's like, I don't know how to answer this question. 
[01:04:30]  Help me.  Yeah, you see that?  Help me.  You kind of look up like, is that a yes, sir, no?  I don't know.  I'm not really sure.  I don't know.  You know I don't like to admit that when I don't know something.  Yeah.  You said no to legs, and that threw off the judges.  See, I just want to let you know.  Yes, that was so stupid.  I just want to let you know I saw the whole thing.  That was so stupid.  Because they go, does it have something to do with legs?  And you said no.  It does.  And I'm like, well, that's going to fuck everybody up.  Your feet are at the end of your fucking legs.  Right.  The foot is part of the legs.  It goes leg, ankle, foot.  No.  I understand technically it does.  Because nobody would have said, does it have something to do with your foot after you said no to 
[01:05:00]  the leg.  Right.  You threw them all off.  Threw them all off.  They were never going to get it after that.  The clues are the worst, maybe the worst clues in the history of game shows that they gave  these people.  Terrible.  Horrible clues.  There's no way.  Except for that one fucking charade brigade asshole who just ran out and started pointing  at his ankle.  That's not a clue.  That's a giveaway.  That was dumb.  They completely gave it away there, yes.  Yeah.  And this, the quarter after.  You got it.  Oh, that's why?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Because all the clocks are set for a quarter after.  And the first clue where the power is going in and out, the lights are flicking off and 
[01:05:30]  on.  Flick.  That was so stupid.  Those were horrible.  Those clocks just came in on the Clue Express.  Did you guys ever go to Smuggler's Notch?  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Politics, contraband.  Smuggler's Notch.  I went in the summer, though, because I don't like skiing.  Oh, my God.  Mountain boarding.  You have giant feet.  You would do well with skis.  Yeah, but they point out.  Yeah, they do.  So, he's constantly slowing down on skis.  Snow plowing.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  It's taking me two weeks to get down the bunny hill.  I don't understand.  Oh, I love skiing.  Oh, she's touching you there.  Oh, look.  There he is.  He looked all disappointed with the basketball hoop.  I would have loved that.  You want to know what happened to that?  At 14, I would have been, holy fuck, they just gave me a brand new basketball hoop.  Nice.  That thing got sold and the money used for wrestling.  I figured it was much.  Look at him, though.  Oh, he's 14 and he's a fucking baby.  He couldn't slam dunk a hamper.  Never mind a fucking basketball.  A regulation basketball hoop.  But kids just like playing hoops in their driveway.  If you live in the suburbs, right?  Not young Sam Roberts. 
[01:06:30]  Of course.  Did you hear me saying it?  Jeffrey Bucks.  After this, I started using human growth hormone to get to a normal size.  You did?  Yeah.  And that worked out for you?  Yeah.  I had to use it for like three years.  Turned you black, though.  Maybe.  Wait, are you kidding?  No.  Three years.  That explains everything.  Explains what?  The fucking giant bone structures.  Artificial growth.  That surprised me when I heard it because Sam is notoriously against like taking Tylenol or any sort of medication when he's sick.  What would you have looked like now had you not taken the growth hormone? 
[01:07:00]  The doctor didn't think I would pass five feet tall.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You're kidding.  Yeah, that's why I was like, yeah, yeah.  That's why you got the big...  Give me the juice.  The bone structures.  You think it blackened me up a little bit?  It blackened you up.  It's not bad.  Wait a minute.  You had a problem for real growing?  Yeah, I took human growth hormone injections every day for three and a half years.  Holy fuck.  Three and a half years.  Did it work out? 
[01:07:30]  Did you get hair around your pee-pee?  Let me check.  Were you that small growing up?  Yeah, dude.  Look at 14 years old.  He's 14 there.  He looks eight.  That's about what I look like at 14.  Maybe you needed some human growth hormone.  I'm starting to think that.  Jesus.  I was 5'2 in 10th grade.  5'2, 91 pounds.  I say it a million times to people.  Because I remember when they did my stats.  I went home and I was depressed and I cried to my mom that the only people smaller than me are the Asians.  I said that.  I did go home and say that. 
[01:08:00]  And then I was really worried I was going to be the shortest kid in class.  Yeah.  But then I finally grew.  I went 5'6 and then I went 5'10, 5'10 and a half by the time I graduated high school.  They went to the doctor and they do...  Why did they just wait a little bit?  Well, we did, but we went to a doctor who was specializing in this stuff and they do two things.  I was remembering yesterday after the show.  The first thing is they x-ray your hand and they do a bone age, looking at your bones.  A bone age.  A little bone age.  To figure out like kind of where you're at. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  So I was like four years behind.  So your bone, it wasn't just you were small, everything.  Yeah.  How tall are you here in this?  I'll figure it out.  Four.  Dude, he's a little kid.  He looks eight or nine.  Eight or nine.  You look eight years old.  Yeah.  I mean, small.  Yeah.  And then they also do a thing.  I don't know exactly what they were testing because I was young.  But like...  A bowl?  They look at your balls.  A bowl, yeah.  Yeah.  And then they have this, like, it's like a key chain.  Uh-huh.  And it has what looks like eggs of different sizes lined up, getting bigger and bigger. 
[01:09:00]  And they see how big your...  Yeah, they show you how big your balls are and how big they'd like them to be.  They compare it like...  How big they would like them to be.  It's like, you should be this ball, but you're this ball.  That's great.  And he touches them.  Yeah.  And then they look at the wooden testicles on a ring.  Like an old...  That's correct.  Like an old warden's keys, right?  The testicle warden.  Yeah.  Wow, and you weren't fucking up to muster on your balls.  No, my balls were way too small. 
[01:09:30]  Aww.  The human growth hormones explain some things.  And it also explains his mom being how she is.  Very overprotective because he was the little kid for so long.  Sure, it explains a lot.  She just expected him to be...  He'll always be that little kid.  And I think it might have pushed your bones out just a little bit.  You think?  I was the...  Until 10th grade, I was the short kid.  Aww.  That was my identity.  But you're tall now.  How tall are you?  5'9", 5'10".  That's pretty good.  Poor little Sammy.  Yeah, I mean, these injections gave me a good 9, 10 inches. 
[01:10:00]  Did it give you a good fucking cock?  Look, look at him.  He's fucking...  I mean, that's not 14.  No.  That's not a 14-year-old right there.  Did it give you a good cock?  I would...  I mean, you can always do better.  It definitely gave me a better dick.  I mean, you know, because there, I didn't have a 14-year-old's dick.  Like, I wasn't jerking off like 14-year-olds are supposed to jerk off.  Look, there's not a hair to be found on his legs.  Can you just a fucking...  Can you still do that ankle thing?  Yeah, I can't do it as far anymore, but I can definitely still do it.  That is really fucked up. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, my ankle still pops.  You can all touch my ankle if you want.  No.  No, I don't think we want to do that.  Whenever, I mean.  Like, you don't have to do it now.  You amazed everybody, though.  Danny Tamburelli was like, what the fuck?  He was amazed.  And you tweet him, and you've discussed this?  Does he remember who you are?  Yeah, I interviewed him a while back, randomly.  And it kind of brought up.  And then we started following each other on Twitter, and then I tweeted the link, and then he watched it.  And was like, oh, that was you.  Right.  He remembers it? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, he said that...  That was like 20 years ago, right?  Yeah, like 15 years ago.  Oh, shit.  Not 20.  Oh, come on.  I was joking, but 15 is...  Yeah, I mean, if I was 14...  Fuck, 15 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  And he said that they were really bad.  He said he thinks that the judges might have just wanted to send me to Smugglish Notch,  because he said their guesses were horrible.  They were terrible.  Yeah.  Here's the other thing about the show that drove me nuts.  They took way too long to show something really cool.  Yeah.  It's a 10-minute clip, right?  Yeah.  On your YouTube channel, and the last 30 seconds is where... 
[01:11:30]  That's the payoff.  Right.  And they don't have time to do the payoff, because they spent all that time.  You're pretty much finally doing the payoff, as credits are rolling.  Yeah.  They ran out of show.  Like, they should be doing five minutes of me, just popping quarters.  Right.  You should be trying to get it into, like, a container or something.  They could have fooled around with it a little bit, but they didn't have any time.  I got so pissed.  After that, speaking of the container, I tried out for Letterman.  I'm surprised I even talked to Justin Stengel, because I hated Letterman for so long.  Stupid human tricks.  Yeah, because I tried out for that, and they said that they loved it, but they wanted me 
[01:12:00]  to shoot it into something like a container.  Yeah.  And I practiced for days, for weeks.  I couldn't aim it like that.  And then they didn't use me, and I was so hurt.  Why didn't you say, yeah, I could do it?  Sam, you're a lie.  How old were you?  This is what you do.  You just pop it off your ankle without aiming, and then go, okay, I've got to put the cup right there.  Right.  Yeah, that's...  I'm serious.  What's wrong with you?  Why aim it towards something when you could just, you know, pop it over and over again  and go, okay, it's consistently landing about right here. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  I'd need a big cup.  I need, like, a big wide bowl, because it's a little unpredictable.  Wow, Letterman didn't...  They couldn't figure that out.  No.  That's too bad.  They also said at the time they didn't really want to use kids.  They were an adult show.  Well, I...  That's true.  One of my good friends growing up, a fellow tornado, Harborfields High School, Glenn, he doesn't  mind I mention him, from Florida.  He was on Letterman.  What?  Yep.  And he did a human fucking trick.  What?  What did he do?  Who was he? 
[01:13:00]  He had this amazing talent where he could get his fucking spit.  You ever see these kids?  What?  Where he could do the drool?  Right, right.  A string of spit.  And he used to hold kids down in school.  Oh, yeah, that was a fucking nightmare.  And then he would make the drool pretty much, like, within, I don't know, centimeters of  the person's face, and then suck it all back up into his mouth.  That's fucking disgusting.  And that dumb trick got him on Letterman.  My shit didn't make it.  Can you try to find that?  I would love to see it. 
[01:13:30]  I think years ago, we actually talked about this, and we found the clip online.  Oh, it's actually out there still.  And he used to, if I remember correctly, I haven't thought about this in years, I believe  he used to pick up potato chips with his own drool.  Oh, God, like, yeah.  And I think he pretty much was able to do it from a standing position.  That's disgusting.  And Letterman said, yep, come on, come on down.  No, they said, and they made me do that quarter trick for them, like, in the tryouts or whatever.  Yeah.  150 times in one sit, my ankles were sore. 
[01:14:00]  Because they were trying to figure out what they could do with it.  I've never had the same power on my ankles as I did after that.  Do you think that blew out your ankle?  It did.  Talent.  He blew out a tendon.  Wore down the fucking thing that caught and then kind of clicked.  Pops, and then he didn't use me.  You know, fucker, ruined your career.  I know Glenn listens almost every morning.  Glenn, if you're out there, fucking tweet me the link, because I want to show these guys.  I know you have it somewhere.  Please, thank you.  Damn.  Yeah, but he made it.  Do you know when this was?  Well, I mean, like, 80s, 90s. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, I can tell you off air how long ago it was, if you don't mind.  Was it the CBS days or the NBC days?  Might have been a state-time show.  Honestly, I don't know what year.  We'll search a little bit during the break.  It's not that big of a deal.  We'll find it eventually.  But then I started injecting HGH.  Get the fuck.  Why are you handing out Les Mis Blu-rays?  Thanks, thanks, thanks, Roland.  I can't watch musicals.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Roland came by with beautiful Blu-rays of Les Mis. 
[01:15:00]  What was his name?  No.  It's really good, though.  No, it's not.  When they go, hello.  When they go, hello.  Do they do that?  I don't know.  All right.  We got a break.  So, the Friday initiative.  We'll see if we can get something out of the day.  Yeah, let's try to get something going.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Let's get a fake drum set for Sal.  That could be good.  Yeah, I want to see Sal fucking tear up the drums.  Can we dig up some pots and shit?  If we can't get any talent, we'll all just sit around and start injecting growth hormone 
[01:15:30]  and see what happens.  See what happens.  It does great things.  Apparently, it does.  Look at that.  I kind of wish they did that with me.  Yeah, but you got there.  I was way behind.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have gotten there.  I made it just in time.  Did you do your...  You would have had to do the bone fucking thing.  I will bring in pictures.  And the ball thing.  Yeah.  The ball thing on the keychain.  I will bring in pictures of what I looked at, like, at 15, and it's not much different  than Sam.  Yeah.  I had a...  They found, like, the growth hormone was not getting distributed properly in my body.  Really?  Yeah.  Was it a pituitary gland problem? 
[01:16:00]  I don't know exactly what it was, but it wasn't getting distributed properly, so that's why  they said, we've got to inject some of this shit into you.  Yeah.  Right above your ass, not into your ass.  Wait, wait.  Where do they do it?  In your hip?  You could do it right above the ass.  Or in your ass?  Not in the ass.  In the thighs, in the arms, or in the gut.  Oh, in the gut.  That one was bad.  Hey, by the way, I'm going to use our massive radio audience, because there are a lot of  stupid human tricks online on YouTube. 
[01:16:30]  Someone find it, please.  His name's Glenn, and he did a spit trick.  Give the listeners a fucking mission.  Yeah, please.  It's drool.  It goes all the way down on the floor.  I'm not sure if on Letterman he picked something up with it.  Pretty disgusting.  But it absolutely was on Letterman.  I want to show these guys.  It was ridiculous.  All right.  All right.  We'll break.  Yeah.  And get into some other things.  Go.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm sorry it went down like this.  Someone had to lose. 
[01:17:00]  It's the nature of the business.  It's the smugglers blues.  Smugglers blues.  Smugglers blues.  Smugglers blues.  Smugglers blues.  The Rolling Stones are going to make over $4 million per show on their upcoming tour.  Holy fuck.  Righteous bucks.  I tried to see them in Brooklyn.  They wanted so much fucking money.  Yeah.  I'm not used to paying for concerts.  Got to get the freebies.  Got to get the freebies. 
[01:17:30]  All about the freebies.  Ah.  And then the Beatles' first album, Please Please Me,  was released in the U.K. 50 years ago.  50 years ago.  Well, that was a quick 50.  What was on that album?  It's the ultimate...  Last night I sent these words to my girl. 
[01:18:00]  I know you never even tried, girl.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Please please.  We won't get like I paid you.  You don't need me to show the weather.  You don't need me to show the weather. 
[01:18:30]  Why do I always have to say the weather?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  We did.  We won't get like I paid you.  Yeah.  Toodly doo.  I don't want to sound like I paid you.  It's just amazing.  I know we've done this one, too, but that's the same band that did I Am the Walrus.  I know.  Kachoo. 
[01:19:00]  Amazing, right?  If you didn't know any better, you would say that's two different bands.  They stopped doing their...  Oh, God, did they.  They kicked that in the balls.  Yep.  This was off Please Please Me.  Well, she was just 17 You know what I mean  And the way she looked was way beyond compare  So how could I dance with another? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, she had no pubic hair  Do you think Denny's appreciating our Beatles break?  I don't think so.  I don't think he's liking the talking over the music.  Oh, really?  We didn't feel like ramping it today.  No.  Now the...  Woo! 
[01:20:00]  Nice.  All right.  Another.  Same album.  Biggie right here.  Holy fuck.  Ferris Bueller, of course.  Of course.  I always think that.  You think he's got this on the hard drive of hits, that Denny guy?  This is so on the hard drive of hits.  Really?  This is one that you play at the parties.  Come on.  Everyone starts singing and dancing.  You have to...  Oh, yeah.  Do your dance. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Got me going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  They didn't have any other hits off that album, right, E-Rock?  I think that's it.  That's it.  We finally got to the end of it, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  E-Rock's struggling for a fourth hit.  Uh-oh. 
[01:21:00]  Uh-oh.  Well, Taste of Honey, I guess.  Taste of Honey.  Taste of Honey, huh?  Oh, my God.  I never had to introduce the Beatles' Taste of Honey on the home of rock and roll.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Let me take a look.  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.  P.S. I Love You.  Yeah, P.S. I Love You might be it.  Let's see what else.  Hold on, hold on.  Ah, you missed Love, Love Me Do.  Come on.  That's the one.  It's not listed for that album on here, but all right. 
[01:21:30]  Love, Love Me Do.  Let's see.  Do you want to know a secret was off this album, too?  No shit.  Listen, shout.  I would say Love Me Do was a big hit for...  Ah, this is a big hit.  Of course it is.  This would be the last one.  That was a huge hit off the album.  It ain't it.  Fifty years ago today.  Set, set, set.  Let's go.  Right now.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:22:00]  You talked it up to the...  You ramped.  The awkward ramp.  Oh, very awkward ramp.  Just adding words until the song starts.  Yeah.  It's a combination of saying something pertinent and hitting the post.  It's got to be smooth.  Yeah.  Just because you hit the ramp doesn't mean you're doing a good job.  You can't just add words until you feel it.  Yeah.  Got to back time that shit.  You need a fucking hot clock in here.  Yeah.  We need a hot clock.  Wait, he said yes. 
[01:22:30]  I can.  Yeah.  We need a hot clock.  Because you know what you guys need in here?  You need a hot clock.  What?  Can I, uh...  Oh.  Oh.  How much I really love you.  Not as big of a hit as the others, though.  You'll never know how much I really care.  This one's pretty big.  Boo-doo-doo-doo.  Listen.  Oh, yeah.  I guess you're right.  Do you want to know a secret?  No, this was another hit.  It sounded like they had a stuffy nose. 
[01:23:00]  Do you promise not to tell?  To tell.  Whoa-whoa.  Glow, sir.  Oh.  Let me whisper in your ear.  We all know that Sam's a queen.  Oh.  Oh, hi, Sam.  The mud hole.  Oh.  Listen.  Ooh-ah-ooh.  Do you want to know a secret?  Listen to tell.  Do you promise not to tell?  Tell.  Whoa-whoa.  This is what me and my brother used to play. 
[01:23:30]  I was on the drums, and he was on the guitar.  And we would put this on, and I would play the drums and start crying because the drum  kit would keep moving forward, and my chair would stay there, so as I was hitting the bass  drum, it would just slide forward, and I would have to start crying.  But you really would cry.  It's on film.  It's on my YouTube channel for Christmas, me and my brother playing.  He's playing guitar, I'm playing drums, and me just crying like a fucking little- 
[01:24:00]  We could see you crying if we go there.  You could see little pissy-eyed Anthony actually crying back in the, I believe it was, I can't  remember the year, but it was on 8mm film with no sound, unfortunately.  Well, say your YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  Well, I don't think that's where it is.  Why don't you say your YouTube channel?  That would be O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Well, not according to CNN.  It says Anthony Cumia. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, dummies.  For photography.  Yeah.  For photography.  For photography.  That's what I use it for.  Um, yeah, I, I don't know where it is.  Um, I, I, I-  Search Christmas.  You guys know at this point I'm obsessed with Paul Rudd.  I just have to announce that Paul Rudd is in another movie that is a fucking failure.  When is Hollywood going to realize that it's over?  Yeah.  That you can't, you can't hire Paul Rudd to play Paul Rudd in a movie anymore?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:25:00]  What?  Please tell me Paul Rudd's coming in.  I'll tell him, I will tell him to his face.  I've had it with him.  What?  He's not coming in.  I just wanted to know if you want to do this live read real quick.  Oh, no.  We have to do live reads for the Paul Rudd movie?  You're kidding, right?  Oh.  That will not be happening.  Oh.  Not the one you're-  Oh, Denny!  Oh.  Not the one you're talking about.  What?  He's in two bombs right now, right?  Oh, boy.  The Tina Fey movie, they're saying if-  Oh, no, that's for the-  It's a Tina Fey movie, right? 
[01:25:30]  No, it's for the Blu-ray that just came out starring Paul Rudd.  He needed the money!  Wait, wait, which movie?  Sporty.  Ooh.  Ah.  Yeah.  I just burned a bridge.  Yeah, I know.  You really did, isn't it?  I burned a bridge.  You're all about building bridges.  But I built the bridge back up.  I really did.  I waited around for about an hour to rebuild the bridge, and I think I might have just fucking-  What happened?  Did it again?  Fucking blew it up.  Fuck, but I fucking hate Paul Rudd. 
[01:26:00]  Is that-  That's not-  That's fucking-  That doesn't mean I don't like a guy or his movies, but I can't- I'm done with Paul Rudd.  Name one movie he was in that he was good.  That he was good.  Not the movie was good.  That he was good.  Okay.  His performance was good.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead, Sam.  Please tell me one.  Ah.  Because he's been in some huge hits.  We know that.  I will say-  Um, yeah.  I kind of liked him in that bromance movie.  Jason Segel's movie? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Where they were singing Rush together?  Yeah.  But was he good in that?  I mean, Jason Segel was good in that.  Jason Segel was really strong.  Jason Segel was extremely strong in that movie.  What was the name of the movie?  I forgot.  I love you, man.  I love you, man.  I like that movie.  Paul Rudd.  I mean, he had a funny part.  Well, couldn't anyone play his part?  He was the awkward guy.  Ah.  He was Paul Rudd!  He's the awkward guy.  He plays that well.  And then he tries to trick you, because he'll grow his hair out a little bit, or throw a mustache on him. 
[01:27:00]  But you're like, no, you're still Paul Rudd, playing Paul Rudd.  He's got a lot of range, though.  He doesn't.  Oh, he's a lot of range.  I liked him in Clueless.  That's before he was Paul Rudd.  That was, um...  I mean, he was Paul Rudd, but nobody knew he was.  But was he playing Paul Rudd?  Yes, he's the same guy in Clueless.  That's so funny.  That was years ago, and he was still Paul Rudd.  Are you in on this Paul Rudd thing?  I am 100% in on that one.  95.  I agree.  I don't know one...  I don't know the difference between one performance from another with him. 
[01:27:30]  All right, let's go over some of these movies.  But he plays the exact same part.  And then it got me in trouble with that big director guy that I really liked.  Certainly did.  Okay, so the big comeback for Paul Rudd was 40-year-old virgin.  That certainly was.  What did he play in that?  He didn't play the virgin.  It was Paul Rudd.  No, he was...  He was the...  It was the awkward guy.  The awkward guy.  He did, uh...  That girls find endearing.  Anyway, he's in...  What did he play in Knocked Up?  I acknowledge that he's been in some huge movies. 
[01:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  Walk...  Walk Hard...  Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember him in that.  Role model.  What did he play in that one?  He was that Paul Rudd guy.  It's the Adam Sandler syndrome.  It really is.  Adam Sandler plays the same fucking guy in every movie.  And it worked for him for a while, yes.  Oh, yeah.  You saw Dinner for Schmuck's, Opie, remember?  He played Paul Rudd!  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit. 
[01:28:30]  Tina Fey and Paul Rudd star in admission.  Humorous world of college admissions.  Well, the movie is not doing well, but they said Tina Fey's performance is excellent, and she saves the movie.  Oscar buzz?  Well, you know what?  She saved the movie from being a complete dud.  Oh.  To be fair to Paul Rudd, doesn't Tina Fey kind of always play Tina Fey?  She hasn't done enough movies yet.  Sort of the sharp-witted average girl?  Yeah.  She hasn't played in enough movies, though, so...  What?  The jury's still out on that. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  The jury is still out.  I mean, because 30 Rock and the Steve Carell movie and the movie she did with the girl from Parks.  Baby Mama.  Baby Mama.  You take your shots at Tina Fey.  She's a mover and a shaker.  I'm holding out hope that Tina Fey fucking knows who I am.  So is my mother.  Don't burn that bridge.  That's right.  Yeah, your mom wants you to be nice to Tina Fey.  She can do something for you.  You know who we've got to start being nice to?  Who's that?  Seth Meyers.  Really?  I think so.  Taking over for Fallon. 
[01:29:30]  That's what I hear.  And we have a good relationship with Fallon, even though we turned him down twice now.  Rumor has it.  You know we've turned him down twice now?  Really?  Well, he called us once on the golf course.  I was on the golf course, and you were at a gun range, and they're like, hey, can you do the show tonight?  Yeah.  And I said, no, I'm playing golf.  Oh, boy.  Truth be told, I wasn't going to be able to get back in time.  Yeah.  And then recently, oh, no, we were on standby for the Olympic thing.  If he couldn't get the Olympic athletes, we were booked. 
[01:30:00]  And then he got the Olympic athletes.  So we didn't blow him off on that one, did we?  I don't think so.  No?  Okay, good, good.  So we've got to start being nice to Seth Meyers, because he's going to take over for Fallon.  Wow.  And we want to be going on that show every once in a while.  Just milk that SNL thing.  Mm-hmm.  Just milk in the SNL teat.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Paul Rudd was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Thank you, Jeff from Long Island.  And he played the surfer dude.  Yep.  Where he wasn't Paul Rudd.  He wasn't Paul Rudd? 
[01:30:30]  He was Paul Rudd.  I thought he was Paul Rudd.  He just grew his hair out.  Yeah.  And, you know, he got a suntan.  Sorry, he played Paul Rudd.  Paul Rudd.  It was a small part, but he was just briefly playing Paul Rudd.  It was a small part.  I don't mind if Paul Rudd briefly plays Paul Rudd.  You're okay with a splash of Paul Rudd?  The entire, like, a leading part?  If he's part of an ensemble cast, I don't mind.  But when they give him the big lead and then he plays Paul Rudd, that's what has been driving  me nuts about him for a while.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  The thing is, he's funny.  He's an everyman.  He's charming.  The girls love some Paul Rudd.  You think the ladies love the Paul Rudd?  They fucking love him.  Yeah.  Is that the problem here?  Because he's funny and he's a guy, but when push comes to shove, he's just a sweetheart.  He's funny?  The girls laugh.  Oh, that was the girls' perspective.  Yeah.  You think Paul Rudd's funny?  I like them in I Love You, Man.  Was he funny in that?  Name one scene you remember from I Love You, Man, which you brought up a couple times now, 
[01:31:30]  where he, Paul Rudd, is being funny.  Or not being Paul Rudd.  Well, I can't say he wasn't being Paul Rudd, but it made me laugh when he was trying to  say goodbye to Jason Segel and sound cool, but he didn't know what to say.  So he said, Laid on him, NJ, and it was awkward.  His delivery was better than mine.  Yeah?  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:32:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I'm glad Rupert liked it.  Is this right?  I don't think so.  There you go.  Wow.  Oh, did anyone else?  I forgot to tweet it yesterday.  Did anyone else see?  The guys, the Mike Francesa guys, I don't know where they are.  Yeah.  I think there's a website.  I don't know.  Really?  Or a Twitter account, but they obsess about Mike Francesa like we do. 
[01:32:30]  They put his head on fucking Louie Anderson's body.  It splashed.  So now it's Mike Francesa doing that stupid fucking dive.  His fall dive.  And I forgot to tweet it yesterday or RT it yesterday.  It is hilarious.  They just put his big goofy head on other people's bodies.  That's great.  They did it for what?  Vince McMahon?  Mm-hmm.  And I think they did it with Ray Lewis, with Ray Lewis's ridiculous dance he used to do. 
[01:33:00]  Oh.  And now he's on Louie Anderson's body doing that splash.  Oh, you found the Paul Rudd scene you like?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  This is one you like?  This is the one I tried to do but didn't deliver well.  Oh.  Okay, and you know what?  Maybe you'll turn me around.  Let's try.  Okay, so to set up the scenario, he's on the phone.  Jason Segel's like a very cool guy who uses...  I don't care.  I don't care.  ...cool slang and...  ...not jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[01:33:30]  Paul Rudd wants to impress him.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  Jason Segel's just like a...  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  Paul Rudd's a little awkward.  He's more of a button-up.  He's more of a button-up type of guy.  He doesn't take a lot of guys' pride.  I don't care.  I don't...  He doesn't care.  That'll always get me.  I'd love that.  We don't use that one enough.  So he's trying to say goodbye to Jason Segel's character. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And I love you, man?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Fusing.  I don't know if you're going to come or not.  No, I'll be there.  I'll be there.  All right.  I'll see you then, bud.  All right.  Let's just on the men, Jay.  And he looks like I can't believe what I just said.  It just makes me laugh every time.  Wow.  I'm laughing.  I swear to you, I don't even know if you're kidding or not.  It makes me laugh.  No. 
[01:34:30]  I think that's a funny scene.  No.  You guys don't like it?  No.  No.  And he's playing Paul Rudd.  That was a perfect example.  One for me.  Yeah.  I mean, I still haven't found a scene where he's different than Paul Rudd.  Iraq, did you think it was funny?  It is funny because it's just the dialogue's ridiculous.  Me and Iraq.  You really think that's funny?  It's just such a douchey moment.  Because you've been in a scenario where you're like, you try to be cool, but you say something,  but your words get mixed up, and then you're not cool anymore. 
[01:35:00]  And then you're like, oh, I'm like that awkward Paul Rudd guy.  Enough for Paul Rudd.  All right.  Well, how many stars for the big movie with Tina Fey?  It's not doing well on Rotten Tomatoes.  Not doing well at all.  39%.  All right.  And since we're talking about hunks, apparently I learned last night on Red Eye, Ryan Gosling.  Yeah.  Ryan Gosling.  He's taking a big break from showbiz, from movies.  Why?  He's got a whole big fucking statement he put out, which translates to, I'm a fucking overthinking 
[01:35:30]  Hollywood shithead who doesn't know how good I have it, and man, I'm going to take a break.  He's got three movies coming out this year.  Right.  No one's going to know he's taking a break.  No one would have known he was taking a break.  If he didn't announce, he's got to take a break from show business.  It just means he wants to travel the world a little bit. 
[01:36:00]  I need a break from myself.  Oh, that'd be great.  He's like, ah, I've been doing too much.  I've lost perspective of what I'm doing.  I think it's good for me to take a break and reassess why I'm doing it and how I'm doing it.  And I think this is probably a good way to learn about what I need a break from myself  and much as I imagine the audience does.  What?  Oh, my God.  He takes himself a little seriously, doesn't he, now?  Totally.  That's, that's, um, he has it easy. 
[01:36:30]  Exactly.  When you brought this up, I got scared because I thought, I thought he was going to rip me off.  Oh, really?  I forgot to tell you this one.  Uh-oh.  On the way home from my long drive, when I'm driving long distances and the kids fall asleep,  my mind starts thinking about shit.  Uh-oh.  And I told my, um, my wife I want to, um, pick up a part-time job.  Oh, really?  A little extra money in the, in the till?  This is not a bit.  This is not a bit.  But now she, she had her suspicions and I'm a little nuts, but I think she is all, there's  the Mike Francesa. 
[01:37:00]  How great is that?  Mike Francesa.  I don't know where these guys are.  I would love to plug them because they're obsessed with Mike Francesa and they got the  Louie Anderson, uh, dive slash splash with Mike Francesa's head on it.  Can you put it on our Facebook page?  Yeah.  It's so, it's just so stupid.  So I want to, I want to pick up a part-time job here in Manhattan.  I want to be, uh, a food delivery guy.  Well, that's a very dangerous job here in Manhattan.  And it's not a bit.  I just want to do it.  Now, why? 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  It would have been something, you want to get on a bike.  It would have been something I would have enjoyed when I was a lot younger as a, as a  job.  Yeah.  Get some exercise, some fresh air.  So you're going to, you're going to get on a bike.  Yeah.  With some food.  Yeah.  I want to work, uh, for some kind of restaurant locally.  I don't want anyone to know who I am.  And then you're going to, yeah, it's fucking 3780.  Yeah.  And then they give you a little $5 tip maybe.  Yeah.  And then I jumped back on my bike back to the restaurant to get the next order. 
[01:38:00]  What if someone goes, Hey, aren't you Opie from the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  That could be a problem.  I'll, I'll wear some weird hat or something.  Could you just say that?  I, yeah, I get that all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would do something like that.  Yeah.  I would have to be recognized just walking around regularly.  Yeah.  Before they recognize me as a delivery guy.  Is there something you want to do?  Yeah.  Then my wife laughed at me.  Of course she did.  Like, that's kind of funny.  And I go, no, I'm, I'm, I'm serious.  I really want to do this. 
[01:38:30]  Why wouldn't she laugh at you on that one?  That's kind of crazy.  It's iconic.  No, no.  Cause then, I mean, the other part of it, I would film it and I, I feel like I could  make something out of it.  I see.  Okay.  I would get like a GoPro.  I would have all the footage of people just treating me like shit.  Like shitty delivery guy.  Give me no tips whatsoever.  Then maybe I, then maybe I would get angry back.  See, I thought you were trying to harken back to a simpler time in your life.  No, that, where, you know, you're just hoping to go and get in fights with people. 
[01:39:00]  Not actual fights.  Door to door.  Yeah.  I think it would be interesting to be one of those guys for a while.  No, to harp back to the past, what I really want to do without filming, and I swear to  you.  Caddy?  Yes.  You want a caddy.  You want a caddy again?  Yes.  Why?  I loved it.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  I love the sport.  I love golf.  And I loved being out there.  You should caddy for Voss.  Oh, God.  No.  You totally should caddy for Voss. 
[01:39:30]  No, I would go back to my old, you know, stomping grounds, the Huntington Crescent Club.  Pro Jack.  And I would take a couple loops.  Trying to get tips?  Yeah.  Would you hope to get the mafia guys so you get big tips?  Yeah.  Yeah, just rework it.  But you're a multi-millionaire.  Yeah, what if someone goes, aren't you Opie from the Opie and Anthony show?  I go, yeah, man, we got fired.  What are you doing?  I almost went back to caddy when we had those two years off.  Really?  Yeah.  I almost did it.  At least you got a fall bag. 
[01:40:00]  If you get fired from here, you just start caddying again.  Go into caddying.  I don't know.  I remember the older guys.  And it's rough on the body.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because those bags are heavy.  You ever think of doing something like that on the side?  Some weird fucking thing?  No.  I have fucking nightmares.  I literally have nightmares about it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I've talked about it where I'm fucking, I'm still doing air conditioning and heating  work for Apollo air conditioning, but I still have the radio gig.  Like, I'm still, this exact life, but I'm also working, putting in air conditioning, and 
[01:40:30]  something will always go wrong.  Like, I'll be late, or I'll be on the job until like two, but not have gotten anything  done.  Right.  And the boss shows up, and I'm all nervous that I'm going to get fired.  And he's mad at me, and he's yelling, and I'm trying to defend myself, and then it pops  in my dream head that I'm like, what the fuck am I doing?  I have a radio career.  This is stupid.  Why do I care?  I wonder where those dreams come from.  I don't know.  We were fired a million times.  Maybe that's it. 
[01:41:00]  Not a million, but how many firings are we up to?  Three.  Yeah, three.  Good ones.  Yeah.  Three good ones?  Three good ones.  Bunch of really good suspensions that we thought we'd get fired from.  Yeah.  From?  Yeah.  That's where that's from.  You must have hated me when I got us fired in Boston.  To me, I'm like, ah.  I wasn't sure about what was going to happen.  Yeah.  I didn't know we were going to get a job in the number one market.  I didn't know.  Like I said many times, I mean, it's not the case anymore, but back then, you purposely 
[01:41:30]  got fired because you always got a better gig.  Yep.  Now you can't even quit.  We should ask Denny about that.  Take all their shit now.  Right.  Denny knows.  Oh, of course.  Denny knows.  Denny would know.  We're keeping Denny out of the studio today.  The culture of radio, though, there was a time you got fired and you got a better gig  because you were in a contract or whatever.  Yeah.  And you just said, all right, fuck it.  I'll blow it up.  I'll blow it up here.  The politics of radio.  And then I'll move on to the bigger market.  That's not the case anymore.  Not, well, that's the mistake we made at N.E.W. 
[01:42:00]  Whoops.  We thought we were untouchable.  Let's do it one more time.  Oops.  Yeah, because that was also the culture of radio where you could get away with almost  murder because you were untouchable.  And that's why we were doing all that crazy shit at N.E.W. thinking there's no way they'll  ever fire us.  I mean, two weeks before we got fired, Jeremy Coleman calls me to tell us, tell me that  we have like a 33, 35 share in Cleveland.  I'm like, well, they're not going to fire a radio show that has a third of the male audience? 
[01:42:30]  Never happened.  Of a city?  Getting fired from N.E.W.  was finding a box of Hodes Wagner cards.  Thinking.  Oh, God.  Yes.  We got it.  We're good.  We got it.  Nobody wants a box.  No.  The box is bad.  When Bob called and said we were fired, I was like, yeah, okay, that's funny.  You know, I didn't take you for a jokester, but that's funny.  And he had to tell me, no, I'm serious.  I'm like, what?  They don't fire guys that are doing this well?  No, we're fucking killing.  When you got in trouble, not fired yet, but like you knew you were in trouble, you still 
[01:43:00]  didn't think you were going to get fired?  Nope.  No.  Why would we?  They told us they were just going to look into it and get us back on the air.  And you thought that was going to happen?  We didn't know yet.  But, you know, Sam, we were number one in our demo all the way down the East Coast.  So I said, there's no way they're going to just fucking, you know, dump the show.  I remember how massive the show was.  I was listening.  You were a little listener.  Yeah, in high school.  And I was like, if you didn't listen to this show, you weren't like. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Were you a little guy with the growth hormones working?  I was listening to you while injecting HGH.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Nice.  Yeah.  I like to know that.  And, uh.  So you grew your dick listening to us.  Your little balls got bigger.  Yeah.  On the little wooden ball ring.  You were able to move all the way to the right side of the ball ring chart.  The ball ring.  Yeah.  We are very pleased.  He was a German guy, too.  We are very pleased at what is happening to your testicles. 
[01:44:00]  Wonderful work.  You want to.  Oh, you were like a little experiment.  Maybe we can make your eyes blue.  You want one of those dream readers?  Whoa.  Dream reader.  Bo-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Steve the therapist.  What?  Who's quickly becoming the number one therapist for the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, okay.  Uh-oh.  Beating out, uh, what's her name?  Lydia.  Big titty Lydia.  Lydia.  Steve the therapist calls from time to time from Connecticut.  Yes.  Steve.  Good evening, boys.  Make it quick, because dream reading stinks. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, what's up?  What's happening there?  Those types of dreams, Anthony, I have them, too.  It usually precedes a period of when we're feeling unprepared for something.  No, you?  Maybe contract negotiations.  No, I have them all the time.  I have them all the time where I'm either working or this one's even better.  I'm back in high school.  Nice.  I'm in high school, and I'm fucking up.  Well, we know what that's about.  We know what that one's about.  Chicks?  Yes. 
[01:45:00]  Of course.  No, I'm back in high school, and I'm fucking up.  I was given another shot at this stage in my life.  I was given another shot to graduate.  Are you an adult in the dreams, or are you you?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I'm me.  And I'm on the radio.  I still have the radio gig.  Really?  But I'm going to school to graduate, and then I wake up to go to school.  And I'm like, oh, I got to get to school.  And then I realize, oh my god, I haven't been there in like a week.  Holy shit, I haven't done the assignments. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know what the fuck.  And then I'm like, I shouldn't go.  And then I start thinking, you know what?  I got this radio gig.  What am I doing?  Why do I care if I graduate?  And then I just blow it off.  Those are my...  I have the same dreams, except I'm in college and don't have the radio gig.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I've forgotten to go to my class all semester.  See?  It's weird.  Yeah.  And then what could happen?  If I'm in the middle of that dream, and I'm in the school, and then I realize I'm dreaming,  that is a fucking field day. 
[01:46:00]  Then start raping the teachers.  High school rape!  Rape the teachers, too.  I fuck it.  Whoever's near me.  You grab a high school girl.  Whoever is near me.  You fly.  I fly.  And then you land and rape.  I just start raping people.  When I know it's a dream, I just turn into a rape man.  I start raping...  I just start ripping girls' clothes off and groping their dirty parts.  But how are you able to control your dreams like that?  I just know.  Because it's such a sensitive environment, and then as soon as you realize you're dreaming, 
[01:46:30]  it wakes you up or something.  Well, well, uh...  Someone's got a horrified look on her face.  What, that's the first time she heard about this?  What are you doing?  It's talked about this.  I just thought...  I'm amazed that you're able to control...  You're in between sleep and waking up, so you can tell your brain, okay, you can do whatever  the fuck you want in this scenario now.  I can't voluntarily have lucid dreams.  But if I'm in a dream and realize I'm dreaming, then I can control it to an extent.  No, I understand, but realizing you're dreaming thing is very sensitive. 
[01:47:00]  It's very difficult.  Because if you realize too much, it's going to pop you out.  Then you wake up.  Right.  Yep.  But if you realize, that's why I go crazy.  I don't have time to finesse a girl in a dream.  If I know I'm dreaming, I might wake up.  So you've got to get right to it and just start ripping clothes off.  Do you have nocturnal omission?  No, I haven't had a wet dream in fucking...  We call them wet dreams.  ...years.  It's a shame.  Years.  You said proper terminology.  Remember that fucking video clip of the trainable? 
[01:47:30]  And the guy, what happened?  I'm all sticky.  I'm all sticky.  Yes.  And the guy has to explain what happened to the retarded boy in bed.  The trainable.  The trainable.  Yes.  But, yeah, I haven't had one of those in a while.  Those are great, though.  I've had the feeling that I was having an orgasm in a dream, but nothing, you know, I woke up and was like, uh-oh.  But nothing, you know, came at the time.  That's weird.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've had wet underpants in the morning.  When was the last time?  I don't know.  Was it a long time ago, or was it kind of recently? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, I used to, like, uh, I used to purposely build up my supply, knowing that eventually I was going to have some crazy dream.  You've got to make your sacrifice of not jacking it.  Right.  And then you've got the big payoff.  And that stuff would happen.  Yeah.  You've got to build up your supply.  I can't do that.  Like, I've had times where I'll jerk off in the afternoon.  No, build up your supply.  It's worth it in the end.  I'll jerk off in the afternoon, and then have a wet dream at night.  Crazy.  Crazy.  You're still young.  Young, dumb, and what?  Full of that gum. 
[01:48:30]  And human growth hormones.  And HGH, it helped.  Oh, yeah, because he got those giant balls.  He got so full of jizz.  Right.  Big part of the key chains.  Yeah, at the end, it was like fucking, there were the little balls, like little fucking marbles that he had.  And then it just turned into, like, croquet balls.  Right.  Bocce balls.  He's feeling bocce balls.  The doctor's like, ah, this is very good.  You could have been a superhero.  You know that?  Yeah, you might have turned into, like...  You could have been a superhero, but instead you're just a douche. 
[01:49:00]  Ah.  Sorry.  Jesus.  My powers of douche-dome are huge.  We will...  It's paying off, finally.  Yeah.  It's not a payoff for you.  We will circumcise him and make a lampshade out of his foreskin.  The urologist did not take care of the growth hormone.  Oh, really?  No, yeah.  I thought it was a Nazi doctor.  Wasn't he a Nazi that did the...  Yeah, were they trying to give you blue eyes, too?  Yeah.  What did he do?  No.  No.  No?  It wasn't a Nazi.  He was just German.  They weren't giving you human... 
[01:49:30]  You don't have a twin, do you?  Not that I'm aware of.  Boy, were they notorious with those twins?  Human experiments with Sam Roberts?  Anything like that with your Nazi doctor?  I don't think so, but like I said...  After they gave you the human growth hormones, did they say to you, let's see what this dick  can do?  Let's take this dick for a fucking sea trial.  Sea trials.  God, that doesn't explain how rich that kid is.  I know.  Sea trials.  No one should ever say sea trials.  We were happy to get a shitty, you know... 
[01:50:00]  Handy down or hand-me-down?  Hand-me-down.  Hand-me-down boat and with an old motor and you just hoped it worked for a while for a  fucking summer.  Here was the sea trials.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  We used to have...  Pfft.  Terrible.  We used to have the best bonfires on the beach.  Waiting River was known, especially 4th of July, every house would just try to outdo  each other with their bonfires.  Yeah.  And ours was always the best because we always had a shitty, broken-down boat on the side 
[01:50:30]  of the house.  And we would save it and we would look at that boat all year long knowing that it was going  on the 4th of July bonfire.  Oh, really?  That bad?  Fuck yeah.  The sea trials.  And they would tilt it, you know, fucking end over end.  Straight up.  That must have been a huge fight.  It was amazing.  Wow.  And then you could see the shores of Connecticut, kind of, in the distance, especially if it  was a clear night.  Oh, yeah.  And then you were able to see their bonfires on the 4th of July.  No one does that anymore.  It's quite illegal.  Not really allowed to do bonfires. 
[01:51:00]  Oh.  Why?  What happened?  They were much too much fun, I guess.  But what happened, really?  Oh, statutes.  I mean, what happened?  Statutes.  Yeah.  Yes, it must be some kind of, brr, we won't allow that.  Somebody probably bitched.  The good old times, man.  And we, I mean, we were in competition every year.  We have to have the biggest bonfire.  And I don't remember a year where we lost back in the old day.  People setting off fireworks and shit.  Yeah.  4th of July used to be great.  4th of July. 
[01:51:30]  Now it's fucking quiet.  Yeah.  You got to go to the fireworks shows that are put on professionally.  Because no one does the neighborhood thing.  And I'm sure a few people do.  But it's not like it used to be.  No, yeah.  People were just setting off fucking fireworks everywhere.  It was great.  You have to go to the organized fireworks.  Yeah.  God, what has happened to this country?  Remember the beginning of June, you would start, like, hearing...  Yeah, yeah.  From the neighborhood?  Well, people were conducting their sea trials.  Yeah, they were fireworks sea trials.  They bought...  You always bought a little extra, because you had to, like, you know, test them out to 
[01:52:00]  make sure.  You had to test out your supply.  Yeah.  And then by the...  And you realize some of the shit that you bought, it sounded good in the name and shit,  but you knew it was just...  Who gives a fuck?  Sparkly crap.  Right.  Oh, Iraq comment.  Certain ice cream trucks used to sell fireworks.  Of course, ice cream trucks.  It had to be ice cream trucks.  Does he do this on purpose?  Why do you do this to yourself?  Does he do this on purpose?  Sorry.  Yes.  Ice cream trucks sold fireworks?  Oh, yeah.  Down there in Florida when you were growing up?  No, Long Island.  Pretty cool, huh?  Did you go on sea trials on the boat you took to school? 
[01:52:30]  Sitting there going, okay, you want fireworks?  No, where's the ice cream?  Yeah, right.  Where's the ice cream?  I can't believe you and I got to drive a speedboat to fucking high school.  Did you...  That is cool.  Amazing.  Great question, though.  Did you sea trial the boat before you went to school with it?  No.  You just took it to school like a fucking Florida rock star.  Yeah.  Once you got it past the no-wake zones, you could open it up and just go right down the  channel.  You were like Crockett and Tubby. 
[01:53:00]  There was Miami.  I was expecting a manatee joke, but I was...  Oh, no.  No, I would go with the Miami Vice thing.  We started yesterday or two years ago.  Yeah, it's a carryover.  Miami slice.  Of ham.  Of meat.  Pizza.  Pizza.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock's still a star.  Let's leave him alone.  He is.  He is.  That was the first insult thrown out, and it took like a week.  Yeah, let's leave him alone.  He's still a star.  Crazy.  Hey, you want to play the viral video for today?  Is it the kid?  No.  What kid?  There's a kid, and he does presidential quotes. 
[01:53:30]  It seems to be the big video that's on the news channels today.  You know, why don't we take a break, and then we'll do the kid video, and I got one.  I'll challenge your viral video.  Ah!  I will challenge.  I say this video will be played on the news tomorrow.  They're always a day behind.  Crocodile.  Giraffe.  All right.  Yes.  We're going to do a little viral video segment.  Oh, okay.  You pick one, I pick one.  Psyched.  I didn't hear of yours. 
[01:54:00]  And we also have Chris Christie taking questions from kindergartners.  Pretty fucking funny.  Yeah.  By the way, I didn't hear the viral video.  I saw it.  Oh, they're already playing it on the news.  They're playing it on the news, so it's probably from last year.  They're probably playing Chocolate Rain tomorrow.  Right.  That's the new hit.  All right.  We'll figure that out and some other things.  But first, what?  You got to do that over there, probably?  Probably a stinger, and then some music starts.  Oh, no.  Music starts right away.  Hey.  Oh, boy. 
[01:54:30]  Thanks.  Thanks, Sam.  If you liked 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, you'll love This Is 40,  the latest hit, Kiamity, from Judd Apatow.  This Is 40 looks in on the lives of Pete and Debbie,  played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.  A few years after the events have knocked up,  after years of marriage,  the couple struggles to balance romance careers,  their own aging parents,  and their now teenage and eight-year-old daughters, 
[01:55:00]  all while trying to figure out how to enjoy the rest of their lives.  This Is 40 features an all-star cast,  including John Lithgow, Megan Fox and her thumbs,  Jason Segel, Melissa McCarthy, Lena Dunham.  And does she get naked in this?  She loves being naked.  She does not.  She plays someone that works at the record company.  Oh, okay.  And her co-worker is Chris O'Dowd.  Or Chris O'Dowd.  Oh, Chris O'Dowd. 
[01:55:30]  Who I really enjoyed in the movie, for real.  How come they don't show him in the movie here?  They don't add him to the cast.  He's becoming a star since then, I guess,  because he's now in that Sapphire movie, right?  Sapphire or Sapphires?  But he's not in This Is 40.  So, you know.  No, he's in the movie.  Well, they don't push him in it.  They should.  He fights over Megan Fox with Jason Segel.  That's a pretty good scene in the movie, too.  They have Graham Parker in here.  Yes, they do.  Graham Cracker. 
[01:56:00]  They have Parker Lewis.  No.  And Albert Brooks.  They didn't promote Billy Joe?  From Green Day?  He's got a cameo.  I thought you were talking like an urban gentleman and saying Billy Joe.  I know.  I always make Billy Joe.  Yo, Billy Joe.  Where's Billy Joe?  He's in the movie.  Oh.  This Is 40 is an honest, candid, and heartwarming comedy about the challenges and rewards of marriage  and parenthood in the modern age.  This Is 40 takes us through Pete and Debbie's milestone meltdown as they each turn 40 while 
[01:56:30]  trying to navigate sex, romance, career triumphs, financial hardships, and everyday life.  This Is 40 is a very funny movie.

[01:57:00]  Where are we at?  What the hell is this?  I don't know what this is.  Oh, I know this.  Yeah, I know this.  Iraq?  Iraq, tell them, I know.  Oh, that's Zombie.  That's Rob Zombie.  That's Rob Zombie.  What is this from?  Is it new? 
[01:57:30]  No.  Really?  I've never heard this.  Maybe you know the hook?  Yeah, I know this song.  For real.  You do?  Yes.  I don't care about it.  Why not?  I don't know.  I don't care about Rob Zombie, man.  That's a mean thing to say.  No, there's a few zombies.  I do like fucking Rob Zombie.  There were a few white zombie songs I liked and then a couple of Rob Zombie songs, but  you know.  This sounds really fucking cool.  Yeah, he's got a great sound.  Yeah.  I like them all.  We just figured you out during the break, Sam Roberts.  We learned today that they injected human growth hormones into you because you were 
[01:58:00]  a very little thing.  You could tell on that fucking Nickelodeon show.  Well, holy shit.  He's 14 years old and he looks like an eight or nine year old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm not even kidding or exaggerating.  So your parents decided to take you to a doctor and they decided how many years?  Three years?  Yeah, I was on it for like three, three and a half years.  Human growth hormones.  Every day?  Daily injections.  Every day.  And they get a shot every day.  Sam Roberts gives us just a tiny little piece here and there. 
[01:58:30]  I've known you for eight years and you've never brought this up.  Right.  And we hang out socially.  You weirdo.  But me and Ant, or I told Ant, I go, you ate like a baby and then you said.  And he stayed like a baby.  You stayed like a baby.  So instead of injecting human growth hormones into you, your parents should have said, all  right, idiots, start eating protein.  Yeah, I have a fucking steak.  First of all, chicken is full of protein.  Not as much as steak, though.  And second of all.  Steak is the motherfucker of protein.  You got chicken hormones is what you got.  It wasn't red meat that was the reason I was... 
[01:59:00]  Red meat is a big deal, man.  You need some growing up.  Yeah, when you're going through those growing years.  You need that.  You need some vegetables.  You just need to eat like an adult to become an adult.  And you probably would have started growing.  I don't think so.  The growth hormone.  You are what you eat.  And you ate like a fucking baby.  A little chicken.  A little chicken baby.  The growth hormone that my body naturally produced was not being distributed properly.  What?  It wasn't dietary.  Oh, that's what they say. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  That's what your Nazi doctor said.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  He could either eat something like an adult or I could give him these injections.  Ah.  You know.  Yeah.  I don't think it was dietary at all.  Uh, Leno, uh...  Man, they're beating the shit out of Leno.  Are they?  I don't get...  I don't get the Leno thing.  He's been a soldier for NBC for 21 years.  And they're just treating him like shit again.  And then the other late night hosts treat him like shit.  I want to put him out to pasture. 
[02:00:00]  Is he that much of an asshole when the cameras are off?  No.  He's apparently a nice guy.  I think it's also very in style to not like Jay Leno right now.  We had, uh, you know, one lovely day with Jay Leno.  We went out there to L.A. and did a show.  And the guy came into our dressing room.  And we're just shooting the shit.  And we're looking at him like, don't you have a show to do?  Very nice.  He was so nice.  He spent a lot more time with us than he needed to.  Letterman would refuse to, you know, even look at us before... 
[02:00:30]  Well, no.  Letterman did come to the side of the stage, which we thought was cool.  But Leno just hung out.  Yeah.  Talking about cars and radio and radio wars.  Very cool.  Very, very cool, man.  Yep.  Anyway, he was on, uh, again.  And we're following this story because every night Leno's, um, talking about the controversy  and how he's getting kind of...  He's bashing, uh...  Shown the door, it looks like.  And, yeah, this was last night.  Every night he's got something about NBC and the rumors. 
[02:01:00]  Ah!  You all excited about March Madness?  You into March Madness?  Yeah!  People talk about who's in, who's out, who's going to be eliminated.  And that's just here at NBC.  That's not even count.  Whoa.  Oh!  Sal on the drums there.  I haven't been in the paper this much.  It's fantastic.  Did you just bring up Sal?  Yeah.  You did, right?  Yeah.  And this is why, Sal, I don't like you. 
[02:01:30]  We gave you another opportunity today.  And is he playing drums for us?  Has he talked about playing drums?  Has he gone down the hall and tried to find a drum kit?  Or at least a bass drum and a snare and a hi-hat?  Something.  Or he's so good at drums.  Why wouldn't you just come up with, like, anything to drum on?  Right.  Play that shit on the table.  Where are you at with playing the drums?  What happened?  I didn't go get one.  Oh, my God.  Have you inquired?  No, I didn't even inquire.  You didn't even go down the hall by the fishbowl or the room where they keep the instruments 
[02:02:00]  and stuff and inquire as to whether we can bring some in here?  I'll go ask right now.  Look, look, look.  Why didn't you?  Look, this is why I bring three different personalities to the show every day.  This is Greg Hughes talking to you.  You're an idiot.  Oh.  You're missing out on opportunities left in the room.  That's the nice one.  That was the nice one.  That was the nice guy.  Yeah, Greg Hughes is the nicest one.  And the officer is the douche-est one.  And Opie is kind of in the middle.  I don't want you to play drums in here.  I don't know.  But that's why you're not going to make anything of yourself. 
[02:02:30]  Holy shit, you know nothing about radio or this program.  Didn't I just say?  Hold on.  Sorry.  Who is this?  Who is this?  I think it's Greg Hughes.  I think it's Greg Hughes coming out.  No, what a little Opie thrown at.  Oh, shit.  Didn't I just say that you were an idiot because you didn't participate in Tequila Donut Day  because it led to us now knowing about Danny, and he's really hot right now as far  as the Opie and Anthony community goes.  And I said that to you this morning.  And then you had another opportunity.  You're like, I'm really good at drums.  We're like, well, let's fucking do that. 
[02:03:00]  And you haven't done anything since we brought it up.  Careful, Opie.  You don't want to get uninvited.  But you didn't trip.  Careful, Opie.  But why wouldn't you try to figure it out and maybe talk to Sam or E-Rock and go, are they  serious?  Because I'm looking around here to see what I can play.  I just thought it would be very pretentious.  Hey, guys, I've got a drum set now.  But we asked.  It wasn't like you just barged in, which would be hilarious, too.  Hey, watch me play drums.  We'd be like, what?  But we were like, hey, we want to see this. 
[02:03:30]  I think there's a kit down the hall.  Does anyone else feel my frustration with this kid?  You're looking at a participation trophy.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  But are you frustrated?  Of course.  There's no.  Like, you see the opportunities, right?  Eric walked in here last Friday with two bottles of tequila and donuts.  Slammed him on the counter.  He was ready for action.  And just said, surprise, guys.  And everybody looked at him like, are you a fucking moron?  We basically wanted to call him an idiot.  And then he created.  We were in shock.  And then he didn't say, he didn't give up on it. 
[02:04:00]  And then it turned out to one of the.  To be one of the better shows we've done in years.  Yes.  He came in with a block of granite.  We went, what is this?  And he made a beautiful statue out of it.  Yeah.  What are we going to do with a rock?  Right.  We're like, what the fuck is this?  A block of granite?  And he chiseled the entire show.  You.  Huh.  Nothing.  Just to come in here and do a drum solo.  Maybe I can play.  Maybe play to a track or something.  You're right, Sal.  You're right.  Oh, Sal.  Sal, do it your way.  Are you guys cool if I bring a drum set in here?  Not anymore.  Do it your way.  We said. 
[02:04:30]  Do it your way.  And let's see how it works out for you.  I'm going to go try to get a kit and maybe, maybe we'll get, you know, get it set up  in here and we'll, we'll play a little something.  You feel it, right?  Of course.  Okay.  Because you got to stay on him.  You feel it.  You should.  There's no way.  There's so many listeners now doing podcasts and this and that are just begging and looking  for their break.  Yeah.  If they were in here, they would have been, holy fuck, I'll, I'll figure it out.  You said, all right, come in here and play the drums.  It's the one thing he knows he does. 
[02:05:00]  But not only has he not come in here yet and play the drums, he, he even forgot we even  talked about it to start the show.  No, but I thought you said, but I thought you said play the drums, Spider.  Yeah.  He, it's exactly Spider with the fucking drink.  So I told you, get the fucking drum kit.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You're just part of that generation.  You don't even, you, you don't even have an idea what you're doing to yourself.  No, I just thought it would be.  You have no fucking clue what it's going to be.  I just thought it would be very douchey of me to come in here and start like a solo.  We asked though.  It wasn't like an idea you came up with. 
[02:05:30]  We said, why don't you get some drums and, and play in here.  We'll, we're doing the Talent Friday thing.  Okay.  So you come in.  But first of all, the show is thematic today with, with trying to find talent around the  place.  You said you play the drums.  We're like, cool.  Get some drums and play it.  It's not douchey because you're not just barging in on a Tuesday going, let me play the drums.  Everything was set up where it would be completely good for you to come in with drums.  And your first mistake is that you're assuming, you know, when you assume you're a fucking 
[02:06:00]  asshole, you're just assuming it without asking further questions about what went down.  Oh, wait, hold on.  I got to see this.  What happened?  Spring Breakers.  Fucking A.  Yeah.  That is some hot shit right there.  Is that movie out today?  I don't, I think it's out today limited.  I am going to just save my cum for that movie.  Remember we were just talking about saving your jizz?  Yeah.  I call it a supply.  You got to save your supply.  The supply.  I don't like working blue when Denny's around.  Oh, blue.  I don't work blue. 
[02:06:30]  When Denny's around, I try to keep it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  I really do try to keep it a little highbrow.  You don't want to disappoint him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're not the only ones frustrated, by the way.  Who else?  Troy's texting me from the other room.  Oh, shit.  Get Troy in here.  Saying this is showing Sal's work ethic.  This is it.  That's his work ethic.  This is it.  Yes.  Sal.  Come on now.  I want to play for you guys.  It'd be cool.  I think it'd be fun.  You had the shot.  There was every opportunity.  Troy, you hear the frustration.  I mean, you feel the frustration.  Do we not feel this frustration almost every day? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God.  What is it about him?  Is it his generation?  Is it a kid that doesn't have to ever work officially?  Are you set?  You don't really have to work, right?  You got money.  No, of course I got to work.  My parents don't help me out anymore.  C-trials.  C-trials.  But that's not my immediate family.  That's my, you know, household.  Troy Tartle.  Outside of this studio, outside of this job, Sal's an awesome guy.  He really is.  He's a musician.  He's cool.  He's another guy I like, but I don't respect or think. 
[02:07:30]  He has a future in this career.  Is that the Oomster?  In the building.  In the building.  Sal doesn't want to work.  No, the Oomster is a goofball, man.  That was Greg Opie.  That was totally honest.  Oh, my God.  Trying to, you know, get into the Sorare girls' fucking pants.  Yeah.  Oomster.  Putting up numbers.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think Troy and me are in the exact same boat where we both think, the reason that  Sal's hired is because we all vouched for him. 
[02:08:00]  Right.  And, like, everybody here thinks Sal's a good guy.  Yes.  And we've hung out with him socially and don't sit there being like, oh, why the fuck are  you here, Bob?  It's like, okay.  I think you're smart.  It's all good.  But you're so clueless.  It's amazing to me.  There's no work ethic.  Look, he's in here with his arms folded.  He's like, he can't wait for us to be done with this.  No, I'm just...  He doesn't listen to any of this stuff.  No.  Because there's no work ethic.  There's no sense of everything is an opportunity. 
[02:08:30]  Like, every time anything happens, he should be thinking, how can I make the most of what's  happening right now?  Because you're the lowest man in the organization.  So why wouldn't you, like, take these opportunities and run with it?  And maybe that leads to something.  I talked to Denny for years and thought he had no worth for this radio show.  Right.  Right.  Nice guy.  We talked about hockey.  And I did enjoy our hockey talks here and there.  Could you imagine, like, because we would walk in in the morning, he'd be there, and  he would talk to me about the Yankees all the time.  Could you imagine me coming to you and going, oh, why don't we get that guy? 
[02:09:00]  You know, the guy by the front door.  You'd be like, why?  Right.  What, are you crazy?  And then he found an opportunity, found a moment.  Right.  And made gold of it.  And went with it.  And in my opinion, Denny knows exactly what he's doing.  Yeah, we think so.  And he knows to come in here.  We think, yeah.  And say what he says because, number one, it is how he feels.  Yeah.  Number two, he's unashamed because he knows the reaction that it'll get.  And he knows what it gives you guys in terms of the show and the...  Did you ever win a trophy? 
[02:09:30]  Um, not really, no.  A trophy?  No.  No.  Well, first of all, Sal's an only child.  Oh, shit.  So, you know, he was just completely weird.  Those kids were always weird.  That's why I made sure I got another one.  A little strange.  I didn't want to do it to my own kid.  You didn't want to make them all weird.  I grew up with the fucking...  Right.  The one and dons, I call them.  And boy, they were pretty much having sex with their moms.  Oh.  Pretty much.  Really?  They're so spoiled.  Have everything handed to them. 
[02:10:00]  Sal comes from a very wealthy family.  He's had a lot of opportunity as a kid.  And, you know, to just move into the city and have an apartment immediately.  You know, it's like...  I live in Brooklyn.  And it's like, Sal, he just got to move in the city.  When we became radio stars, I still wasn't sure if I could swing a New York City apartment.  Hells no.  I'm chilling in Westchester.  I'll never leave.  Who gets to do that?  I have no idea.  You know when I bought my house six years ago? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  That's it?  That's it.  And we were pretty fucking good before six years ago.  Yeah.  But there was no way.  I wasn't going to take that financial commitment until I was sure.  Right.  When I turned...  That sounds like...  You're right.  When I turned 35, I'm like, I gotta get a house now, finally.  So I was like, let me move to the fucking expensive hipster part of fucking Brooklyn.  Mommy and Daddy got it.  I'm fucking...  Yeah.  They don't have any issues.  They don't.  Yeah, but you told us when you first moved in that they were helping you out.  They helped me, like, with buying furniture and stuff like that. 
[02:11:00]  Paying your phone bill.  That was like a graduation gift to me.  Graduation gift.  Let's cut to the chase.  What are you looking for here at SiriusXM?  What am I looking for?  Yeah, because we're not going to fucking help you out.  We gave you a great opportunity.  We gave Sam a great opportunity.  The rest of these guys a great opportunity.  And then they're making something.  It's what you make of it.  There's a million radio shows here.  And as much as we beat the shit out of this place, you know, at your age, this is a beautiful  place to be.  Oh, my God.  I would have loved a place like this when, you know, I didn't get bitter. 
[02:11:30]  Before I got bitter, I should say.  That's why it's frustrating for me, because I was in literally the exact same position as  Sal was in.  Doggy style.  Oh.  I thought that was a different position.  I mean, I had to intern for free a little longer, but literally brought in in the exact  position at the exact spot, low man on the totem pole, everything.  But you were hungry, though.  There's only...  There's just...  He doesn't know... 
[02:12:00]  He doesn't know hunger.  You rock has nothing to do with it.  And also, Sal's never worked in, like, a factory or worked in, like, a fast food shop.  Oh, Sal, do you ever...  What's the worst job you had before this?  Worst job?  Yeah.  Like, the most work...  Just doing, like, clean up for, like, construction, I guess.  Like, nothing...  What?  Labor?  Like, yeah.  On your uncle's job site or something?  Yeah, but it was...  We watched The Sopranos.  We know how that shit worked.  You went in, you signed a fucking card, and you didn't do anything.  No, no, no.  Wait a minute.  Absolutely.  Hold on.  Are we messing with a mafia kid? 
[02:12:30]  Probably.  Oh, fuck.  You know, do whatever the fuck you want, man.  It's a little connected.  You're doing great.  You're doing great, buddy.  That's not true.  No, it was just, like, you're doing, like, normal, like, clean up on a construction site.  Yeah, but you came by, and they were like, yeah, watch out.  That's the boss's fucking nephew.  No, it was...  You can't talk in front of him.  The foreman or whatever.  Of course.  That's how I got the job.  It's not because you really need experience.  It's just a little nepotism.  Yeah, that's right.  That's what it was, man.  It's nepotism.  And everyone on the job knew that they couldn't really fuck with you. 
[02:13:00]  They couldn't, like, yell at you or make you work more.  So what'd you do?  You got a broom and a fucking wheelbarrow.  You swept up some fucking pieces of wood and electric conduit.  It was a summer job.  It wasn't, like, a permanent job.  A summer job.  Let me...  Well, yeah, I was in high school.  I can't work in a high school.  But that was your worst job?  That was...  Yeah, I mean, I also...  I worked in an auto shop.  Someone want to ask me what my worst job was?  What's your worst job?  Around the same age as Sal there?  Worst job you ever had.  Well, I was a caddy.  Yeah.  And I made a shitload of money being a caddy. 
[02:13:30]  But because we were a poor family, I gave all my fucking money to the household.  Hey, put that in the jar!  Yeah, exactly.  That's why that movie...  Caddyshack.  I can relate to that movie.  So then I'd go to college and go through my money really quickly because I didn't...  I wasn't able to bring a lot of it.  So then when I came home for breaks, I had to do what's called office temp work.  Ooh.  Where these companies would call you up and go, well, today you're going to fucking unload  some trucks.  Today you're going to do this.  You know.  And I respect the people that do all those jobs. 
[02:14:00]  All right?  Oh, man.  But the worst job I had, there used to be a restaurant at the Walt Whitman Mall.  Yeah.  And they said, you're going to be washing dishes for the next week.  I'm like, all right, I can fucking do it.  I need the money.  And, you know, I was looking for some drinking cash.  Went there.  My boss was a retard.  Yeah.  An actual retard.  Like full on?  Full on retard.  Wow.  I was introduced to this guy and he said, this is your boss for the next week.  And he was a retarded dude?  He was retarded.  And he was my boss.  And it was a complete nightmare because I couldn't reason with him or anything. 
[02:14:30]  Because the retarded dude is just telling you exactly what he was told to tell you.  Yeah, because he was a Rain Man retarded kid.  Oh, Jesus.  Where everything was, you know.  He's an intern David.  Where, like, the glasses had to be cleaned first and all this weird shit.  I lasted.  And I don't like quitting jobs, believe it or not.  I take pride in putting in a, you know.  You like being fucking fired in front of public.  You know, fuck quitting when you could blow yourself up in the middle of the public forum. 
[02:15:00]  But I couldn't take it.  And this is a true story.  I put all my dishes in the fucking garbage.  Basically saying I'm done for the day because I thought they wouldn't notice.  And then I left.  Yeah.  And I never went back.  That was my worst job.  Someone goes, yeah, we'll be sure some pride.  I know.  I want to hang in there is what I'm saying.  But I couldn't.  Worst job ever.  And you think, like, the sheet metal stuff was bad.  I worked at a fence company. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, fuck.  And here's what I did.  The trucks would come in all the time.  These giant rolls of chain link fans and other things.  And they were all on these wooden pallets.  And they would take the pallets off the truck.  And in transit, a lot of these pallets would get busted and stuff.  I had to take the busted pallets, take the good parts off of the busted pallets, and  build new good pallets from the busted ones, and then throw the busted ones in a 55-gallon  drum that was on fire, you know? 
[02:16:00]  Right.  And it was in the middle of the fucking winter.  It was freezing cold.  Right.  So occasionally I'd be by the 55-gallon drum getting warm.  Like you're a hobo.  And then I'd have to go back to salvaging the shitty pallet things for good things and  then nailing together a good pallet.  It was so bad.  Well, let the record show that as you're telling this horrific story, Sal's nodding.  So I guess he can relate to you.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that job done before.  On your uncle's fucking job, Sal.  Oh, see?  I've seen it.  Thank you.  There's the difference.  Oh, I've seen that job done before. 
[02:16:30]  I pitied the fool.  But because I'm the nephew of the Mafia boss, I just had to sweep up an hour and they would  give me eight hours in.  Exactly.  And before you guys started talking about your job, Sal said something I think would piss  off a lot of people.  Oh, no.  He said, of course it was a summer job.  I was in high school.  What, am I going to go to high school and have a job?  Oh.  You didn't have a job through high school?  During high school?  I got a job once I got a car in high school.  Chicago Pizza Pub, washing dishes.  That's what I did during fucking school.  I was building trophies throughout high school.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:17:00]  I had two jobs in high school.  No, I'm not one.  I was lucky.  I mean, I had a cool job, the caddy thing, but the golf course was right there.  I lucked out.  Golf course?  So I didn't have shitty jobs through high school, really.  Oh, crap.  I actually enjoyed the hell out of it.  All right.  I'd love to go get a kid for you guys and play.  So I don't want to...  Oh, he's done talking to you.  Oh!  No, I want to take initiative.  Why am I wasting more time here?  I can go get the kid.  You can't take initiative now.  You can try to make up for fucking up.  I'll try to make up for it.  You can't take the initiative.  I'll try to make up for it, and hopefully I can do something cool.  And you guys talking to him and trying to teach him these lessons? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  He's not going to waste the time.  You know what?  I'm listening.  I heard it.  I don't know.  And how old are you now?  I'm 22.  Oh, boy.  God, I'll say it again.  I wanted to do radio so badly at 22.  I had a shitload of passion, but everyone around me had the same passion.  It was a nightmare.  Oh, boy.  I wish I was coming up now.  It would be so fucking easy to succeed.  Guys like Sal make my world a lot easier.  Mm-hmm.  A lot easier in terms of competition.  Because even a piece of shit like you could look good.  Dude, how do you think I've gotten by? 
[02:18:00]  There is just...  It started for us about five or six years ago where we saw these kids coming up with  no passion, no initiative, just going through the motions.  And I've daydreamed in this seat many times thinking, God, I wish I was coming up now.  I would have fucking blown past all these guys.  Mm-hmm.  We had a...  I used to have to fight to do the Christmas Eve, Christmas morning shift instead of going  home to my family.  Whoa.  But instead of them just giving it to me because no one else wanted it, everybody wanted it. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Now you wouldn't be able to find somebody to take it.  Good times.  Of course not.  That's what I'm saying.  You couldn't pay an intern to take it.  Of course not.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  It's crazy.  Good times.  I wonder if we could do like a swap with Denny for Sal.  Get Denny on staff?  Yeah.  I would get Denny on staff in a second.  Could you imagine like, hey, we're going to give you this opportunity.  That's funny.  You have to do this.  Vinny said they call him Sally No Drive.  Sally No Drive.  That's your mob name on the fucking... 
[02:19:00]  Sally No Drive.  On the job site.  Hey, it's Sally No Drive.  Denny would whip the whole staff into shape.  And what I say is like, none of this is sinking in with Sal.  I got it.  It's too late for you, I think.  I really do.  But I think you'll have a good life.  Your family's set to go.  Oh, yeah, you're set.  You can fail and you just got that net under you for your whole life.  You'll have a safety net.  You don't have to worry about making sure your feet are on that fucking tightrope.  You could be all lackadaisical and sloppy. 
[02:19:30]  You got a beautiful net to catch you.  It's fun to fall into the net.  It's fun.  You rock.  Good pick up.  How lucky can one guy be?  Yeah.  Sally No Drive is here.  Hey, Sally.  Tell your uncle I said hello.  Send a bottle of champagne over to Sally No Drive.  For his uncle.  For his uncle.  Oh, man, that's funny. 
[02:20:00]  All right, well, some day the kids from around the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries.  You know why?  Because I wouldn't.  I have no motivation or drive.  It wasn't out of respect.  It was out of fear for my uncle.  All my life, I always wanted to be a slacker.  Can you imagine being a slacker growing up?  We didn't have that opportunity.  I was a slacker, but you know what?  I had nothing. 
[02:20:30]  I wound up having to sleep in my car before I realized, hey, this ain't working out.  I didn't have the big safety net.  You know?  If you had a safety net, would you have been like...  No, I'd have been a piece of shit like Sam.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, it's there before the grace of God go by.  Holy shit.  Sam's loving this.  But there's a lot of realism here.  It's very real.  I see this a lot around me. 
[02:21:00]  And out of all the interns that I've seen, Sal was the best one.  That's why everybody was like, oh shit, look at this dude.  Which really goes to show how bad these kids are.  You know?  You guys are picking them.  First time we see them is when they come through the door with coffee or something.  Karen, we needed that money.  That's all we had except for what my family gives me.  Go ahead and flush it, Karen.  Yeah, go ahead and flush it.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, you know I'd go from riches to riches.  I know I'd go from riches to even more riches.  He's selling cigarettes out of the trunk.  No, take another box.  Yeah, just take it.  It doesn't matter.  It's cool.  Just take it.  Yeah.  It's all good.  Just a car with an open trunk and nobody around.  Oh, no one around.  It doesn't matter.  A sign that says, help yourself.  His family will take care of him.  It's okay.  It's all good.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:22:00]  Jesus.  I think it was the anger panda bit.  That's what set Sal off.  I think from there it was downhill.  He's like, fuck you guys.  Defining moment.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And fuck you.  He's never been told that something he did sucked.  Nope.  But now it doesn't suck.  Now it's become a thing.  Well, it still sucks.  It still sucks.  But now it's like, you know.  Now it's a goof.  Worth playing.  It's so bad now.  It's good.  Don't get the panda angry. 
[02:22:30]  And then Tiger.  First and last piece of production.  And Tiger.  You never tried again, did you?  Not 100% on my own like that.  Fuck no.  That was why wouldn't you?  Fuck you.  Fuck you and fuck you.  Right.  You're right.  That isn't somebody that did something and went like, oh my god, I'm never going to do  that again because I'm so embarrassed.  That was, I'm never going to do that again because fuck you.  He walks in like that.  I gave you fucking gold and you pissed on it.  Iraq, say what you're going to say. 
[02:23:00]  The face you just dropped to when he said fuck no.  You are so pissed.  Because it's just amazing to me.  No, I was told so many times that I sucked at this and that and do it again and they would  throw it in the garbage in front of my face.  Yeah.  And I kept trying.  Fuck no.  And he goes, fuck no.  Like, it wasn't even a thought that he would try again.  Hey Sam, could you look that up for me?  No.  Fuck no.  Why wouldn't you try?  You told me last time I was slow. 
[02:23:30]  All the other things I've done after then have always been working with you guys, Troy  and Sam, because I just, there's no way I can do it independently.  Because you're not used to being told like you stink or told no or any of that stuff.  And Sam will come up with an idea and then we'll hear about it in the meeting and they're  like, okay, it's not bad.  You just throw some ideas together and even just pass it off to Sam and let Sam write  it or, you know, I'll produce it or whatever.  And then it just will never get done.  And you're just kind of like, well, what happened to that idea?  What happened?  Amazing.  And by the way, how many weirdo bits have I handed you that you've, remember Epstein 
[02:24:00]  and the Inventor?  I love that bit.  But you guys at first were like, what the fuck is this?  What are you guys even doing?  Who knew?  And we go, oh, okay, well, obviously this needs to be a series.  We're doing another one.  It was, I love it.  We're doing another one.  Can we play one of those to the break?  It's the dumbest fucking, I love it though.  Same punchline.  We're doing another one.  I know, I know.  It's all about what?  Getting something up someone's ass.  No.  Up my nine.  Up my nine.  I didn't want to give away your fucking catchphrase.  That's the big catchphrase.  That was Steve's catchphrase. 
[02:24:30]  Oh my God.  All right, Sal.  Fuck him.  Sal might play drums.  We'll see.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If he feels like it.  You're going to try to get a drum kit?  Fuck no!  Fuck no!  Carry it down the hallway?  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  What a fuck you later, by the way.  Life could be a lot easier if you just do that.  Just say fuck no.  But it's easy for him because, again, the net is there.  Dude, negative or positive.  I would never leave a studio when somebody was talking about me. 
[02:25:00]  Oh God.  What if I could turn this shit around?  Right.  What if I could do something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll fucking leave.  You don't leave unless someone says your name wrong.  Because you know what happens when you leave?  Yeah.  Somebody else is there to take your spot.  Somebody else fucking grabs the mic.  He don't care, though.  And you're done skiing.  I'm still looking over my back to see where Jim Chandler's at.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  All right?  I'm still looking.  He might come for you at some point.  I'm still looking over my shoulder at the guys.  Oh my God.  Is he just about a piece of shit?  It's just incredible, isn't it?  It's fucking astounding.  The opportunity is there.  The road in front of him.  And he just pisses all over it.  Opie, you've been in radio forever.  A long time since I was 18, if you need to know.  If you could come in here.  Before that.  Mid-80s.  There's literally 200 radio stations.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  On one floor.  Yeah.  All you have to do is go talk to people.  You can get on all of them.  Trust me.  If I was just out of college, I was fortunate enough to work at CMF in Rochester, but it was  one rock station with guys that were there forever.  There were such tiny opportunities.  But every time you saw that tiny opportunity open up, you threw your fucking name in the  hat.  You're like, fucking pick me.  I'll do this.  I'll do that.  That's why I did every job.  And when there weren't opportunities.  I even did a little sales work. 
[02:26:30]  Which I hated.  When there weren't opportunities, you show up just so they know your face.  I used to just hang around all day.  Yeah.  Knowing that maybe someone called in sick.  I would get excited because I got to do the traffic for Rochester, New York in afternoon  drive.  Because, you know.  That's afternoon drive.  I actually made that position.  I forgot.  I went to the program director.  Like, look, you guys don't really do.  I don't believe in traffic.  I never did.  No, it's true.  But I knew that they cared a little bit about it.  So I went to Stan Mayne, the program director.  This was one of my big breaks. 
[02:27:00]  And I said, look, I want to do traffic.  I get along with Janet Miriam was her name.  And she was a fine broadcaster.  I go, I'll do traffic on Janet's show.  And then they talked to Janet.  She's like, yeah, we get along.  We have a little rapport.  Yeah, let's do that.  So then I did the stupid straightforward traffic.  But then it led to just throwing in a little bit here, a little bit there, a little personality.  The next thing you know, you fast forward.  She's doing an interview with Jimmy Page.  And I'm helping her interview Jimmy Page on the phone.  That's how it goes.  That's how it works.  I mean, I might ask one question, but in my mind, I was there. 
[02:27:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  But now, my point, 22 in this place where you have a million radio stations, I would be  knocking on every programmer's door and say, what can I do for you?  Dude, all I did was record a demo where I made my voice sound like Kid Kelly's voice and  asked if I could do overnight.  Wow.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  And they were like, yeah, you sound great.  Brilliant.  I don't understand.  Yes, Travis.  I just remember stuff like we slept in the studio because there was a transit strike. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  So we had to be here.  You think Sal would ever sleep in the studio?  Dude, what happened when there was a blackout?  He's got his apartment that his parents paid for.  He wasn't here.  Oh.  Remember?  No, because he's forgettable.  He wasn't here.  He's forgettable.  I never think, oh, boy, I don't know what we're going to do today.  Sal's gone.  He's never done that?  No.  Not in the least.  You know a couple weeks ago he was sick for a week?  What?  I swear to God, no.  Four days out of the five.  Didn't even know. 
[02:28:30]  You didn't?  No idea.  He did just enough to squeak in and get a gig.  And then just turned it off.  Yep.  He tricked everybody.  He used to come in and do Sundays with me.  I was like, oh, this kid's hungry.  Just enough.  Two weeks after he got hired.  That was his last Sunday.  I don't know.  One hit wonder.  I don't believe he's hungry in the least.  Yeah, he's full.  He did some production as an intern that we were like, holy shit.  I've never heard an intern do shit this good.  And he has a good ear for mixing in Pro Tools.  And then that's why we were like, yo, we need to hire this guy. 
[02:29:00]  And then.  You guys are right there with that panda bit.  He never recovered from that.  He never did recover from that.  No.  That was a defining moment.  Fuck you.  It's just about forgetting it and moving on.  Yeah, yeah.  I gave you guys that Nicolas Cage, Jimmy Fallon thing.  I was so confident you were both going to completely not like it.  Yeah.  You think I thought twice about it afterwards?  No, I loved it.  No.  That one I loved.  So we didn't agree.  Oh, well.  You going to stop giving clips?  Yeah, I'm not doing that anymore.  I'm done.  You think the Radio Wizards got a raging heart on because he found someone just like him? 
[02:29:30]  Oh, shit.  I'll tell you this.  Sal has made E-Rock's life easier.  Why?  Because how can you shit on E-Rock?  That's true.  Well, we try.  I know.  You still may.  And succeed.  We give it a good effort.  Daily.  Yeah.  I mean, this opportunity was amazing because it was, Sal had to play some drums.  That's what we asked. 
[02:30:00]  And it was under the context of we have a talent thing that we were looking to do with  people around the facility.  Um, Sal said he had a talent playing drums.  I mean, it all fit into him finding drums and playing drums.  Not coming back in and going, no, well, I thought it would be, you know, sort of, no,  we, we, we, it was a recommendation from us.  An hour and a half later, by the way.  That was, yeah.  Like, that tells you right there.  He has no fucking clue.  And think about it. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, if he plays the drums really well and he came in and did it, how many people  would hear him do that?  Right.  You could get a gig doing studio session work or anything.  At the very least, Opie and Anthony go.  Wow.  He can do something.  You're good.  It's an opportunity.  Go for it.  Do you think he thought we were going to find the drums for him?  Yes.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's why nobody did anything.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we still have to do our viral.  But we shouldn't.  I mean.  Our viral video.  All right.  You know what?  I swear to you, I thought it was eight o'clock.  It's nine, ten.  I can't even fucking believe how quickly. 
[02:31:00]  And there's food on the way.  Well, it better get here soon.  Better.  Yeah.  I think.  Well, it's at any minute.  Like, 20 minutes ago and then 10 minutes ago.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That was great.  But it's coming.  And we got the Chris Christie thing, which is really fun.  Oh, yes.  Being interviewed by kindergartners.  And I think my viral video, not my personal viral video, which I'm still looking for, but  a video I saw, I think, is more viral than the video Anthony saw.  I don't know, Opie.  I'm thinking mine's more viral. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, look at this.  That's about a dollar.  You guys don't want me to actually pull these things up, do you?  What?  The viral videos?  Yeah.  It's right there.  There's mine.  I don't want to have to go on.  Oh, I see what you did there.  You were acting like a piece of shit.  I do it so well.  Yes.  Why not?  Why not?  All right.  Drink it up.  Get up.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up.  Drink up.  Drink up. 
[02:32:00]  The Obama cool lane.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  Wouldn't you rather have a guy holding a gun on you?  Or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you? 
[02:32:30]  Let me know.  Because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Right now.  Right now.  We're having a gun held on us right now.  Stop it.  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  Right.  Like, what?  Can I wear one of those out?  And not be beaten to a pole?  It's time for Whitey to realize.  We don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains. 
[02:33:00]  I'm in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold.  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay?  How long do we pay?  How long do we pay?  Before people fucking act like human fucking beings. 
[02:33:30]  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Oh, let me know.  How long do we pay?  I'm fucking exhausted.  I'm going to need a nap.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:34:00]  Anthony.  Denny's not going to be happy with us right now.  No, no.  I don't think so.  Wow, Roland came through again.  Totally.  I heard there might be food today.  But I wasn't expecting this.  Holy crap.  I was expecting like some fast food burgers.  But Roland gets this gourmet shit.  Yeah, we got like...  I got some ahi tuna.  Lightly seared. 
[02:34:30]  I'm eating filet mignon.  With a nice ginger balsamic vinaigrette.  With some nice mushrooms.  We got a steak over there.  Oh, this is so good.  Yes.  Filet mignon.  Oh, and it looks like a drum set is being set up.  Oh, yeah?  Who's going to play drums?  I don't know.  I've got to find someone.  The Cubans here.  What's up?  Do you have an adjective before?  Cuban?  Angry Cuban?  Something like that?  They used to call me the squirrel because I was all coked up and jittery in the 80s and 90s. 
[02:35:00]  Really?  Yeah, that was out of my mind.  That was out of my mind.  The Cuban never disappoints.  I met the Cuban the first time when I went down to Guy Fieri's place.  Ah, yeah.  To check that shit out.  And you're running the kitchen down there, right?  Man, that was crazy.  Oh, you don't run it anymore?  No, I just open them.  I'm way too unstable to see it.  Wait, you're done with Guy Fieri, kind of?  No, with that build?  Yeah, with that build down, yeah.  I'm there to get it going. 
[02:35:30]  And then like responsible people with families do it after I leave.  Oh, so you're not there day to day anymore?  I'm at my place.  My place went, I have a place in Jersey and it came out on diners, drive-ins, and dives  and all hell broke loose.  Really?  All the creeps showed up.  I heard it's a tiny place though, right?  750 square feet.  Wow.  How many tables is that?  Nine tables.  Nine tables.  That's it.  Booked for two months.  Crazy.  Yeah, he's not here to promote.  He doesn't need to promote his restaurant.  What's the name of it?  Nobody Go.  Nobody Go is the name of it? 
[02:36:00]  That's a good name for a place.  It's called Marie's.  Marie's?  Marie's, my wife's name.  Marie's.  Do you like Marie?  I do.  I liked her more before we opened this thing.  Really?  It's tough, man.  Yeah?  It's tough.  Why don't you find some guys?  And you sit home and just kind of check the numbers.  It doesn't work.  It's too small.  My bro's in the same boat.  Can't leave.  He can't leave either.  He can't.  They'll steal from me.  He's happy that he went from 80 hours a week to 60.  Yeah.  I get to go to Short Hills Mall once a week. 
[02:36:30]  That's my thing.  Why?  Just look at chicks.  Look at the juice.  Do the laps with the old people with the heart conditions.  Right.  Go around the mall.  Go around the mall.  My brother-in-law's called looking at the juice.  Watch chicks try shoes on.  Yeah.  Oh, you like that.  Ah, a little foot fetish for the cubits.  What's going on there?  Where's the food from?  Where does it matter?  This is Heartland Brewery.  My buddy, John Blumstein, Roland called me yesterday.  He's like, hey, you know, the guys kind of want food. 
[02:37:00]  Who do you think I should call?  I go, you're talking to them, asshole.  Right.  Tell me what you want.  Don't be passive aggressive about it.  Just tell me you need food.  They're famous.  Because you run a lot of the joints.  Yeah.  You're connected to a lot of joints in New York City.  A lot of joints.  Could you calm down, please?  We're conducting an interview.  After all.  Oh, boy.  This is some pretty good news.  Heartland Brewery.  I don't even know where that place is.  There's a couple of them.  There's seven of them. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  Yeah.  They just lost one to the hurricane at South Street Seaport.  It got beveled.  Yeah, South Street Seaport hasn't come back yet.  They were just doing something on the news the other day where like 80% of the shit is still closed down.  And the insurance companies are being real dicks about the whole thing, so.  Really?  Well, that never happened.  No, that's never happened.  That's too bad.  South Street Seaport used to be a cool little place to go.  A lot of douchebags there, though, in the summer.  It's not easy.  What do you mean?  A lot of tourists, bridge and tunnel people.  It gets weird.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And Times Square is? 
[02:38:00]  Times Square is just the, you know, it's the Super Bowl of the worst.  Yeah.  I don't understand these people that come to New York just to hang out with everybody else that are visiting New York and Times Square.  They walk too slow.  Oh, that's my problem.  Oh, get out of the way, you bastard.  Because they're amazed by the big buildings.  They walk on the wrong side of the street and they take fucking selfies all day for Facebook.  That's true.  The human rules.  When he's taking a picture of Bubba Gum Shrimp, go fuck yourself.  But instead, you know, you move away from Times Square and really see New York. 
[02:38:30]  Most of these people don't.  I give them the worst food advice.  They're like, where should I go eat?  Oh, my God.  Oh, well.  Sbarro's is sick.  Sbarro's.  Die in a plane.  That's some good local humor right there.  Sbarro's.  Terrible.  Sbarro's.  KFC on 36 is packed.  Get an extra biscuit, you fatso.  Well, why aren't you eating?  I had some. 
[02:39:00]  Well, you have.  I had delicious Buffalo Spring Rolls.  Buffalo Spring Rolls?  Oh.  He was on a diet.  He came to see me yesterday when I was getting this.  Well, you take a look at your Buffalo Spring Rolls because that's my brother's fucking main  attraction at the FH Riley's.  Uh-oh.  This is really good, though.  What the fuck?  We'll take them off the menu immediately.  Friday.  Food Friday.  Yeah, my brothers are better.  Oh, shit.  Atta boy.  Look out.  I can tell by the look of these.  Oh, man.  My brother makes his with a little love. 
[02:39:30]  We made them like Sean.  You know what's good about these?  Yeah.  They're here.  Damn.  I'm not going to try that.  Garbage.  Knowing my brother makes a damn good fucking Buffalo Spring Roll at FH Riley's in the heart  of Huntington Village.  Man.  Don't yourself ever bring a spring roll here.  No.  It's all good.  Just dumb jokes.  How many people have to remember that?  Oh, don't bring a spring roll with you.  Right.  So I want to see these two viral videos. 
[02:40:00]  We got a viral video competition here, Cuban.  I just saw this one on the news.  And I also saw a viral video on the news, so we're going to see which one is better.  But I'm going in blind here.  Well, deaf.  I hadn't heard this.  I saw, but I didn't hear.  Apparently this kid does presidential quotes.  How old would you say he is?  You're a parent there.  How old do you say that kid is?  I guess I would say about eight months.  I was going to say 18 years old. 
[02:40:30]  He's about six, I guess.  He's about six years old?  Younger.  I think he's younger.  Four or five?  He's a two-year-old?  Jesus.  Are you sure you have kids?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's a two-year-old?  Yeah.  That's what the description says.  Nah, they're lying.  Maybe he's got the Sam disease.  Yeah, no, it's...  He needs fucking growth hormones.  Because probably a six-year-old, if you saw a six-year-old doing this, you're like,  ah, what's the big deal?  But then you fucking upload the video and say, this is my two-year-old.  Once it's a two-year-old, then you're amazed. 
[02:41:00]  I think some shenanigans going on, because everyone's looking for that viral video.  What about hijinks?  And hijinks.  It's like those Spanish kids that had their pictures in high school, and they're 27.  They were like, fucking, yeah.  They were in the Mexican mafia and shit.  He drove here.  He's a sophomore.  He has two kids.  One's the catcher.  This is bullshit.  If Cuba was only going to drop off the food, I'm like, no fucking way.  He's sitting down, god damn it.  Fucking character. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, he was on Roland's show.  Dude, that show's crazy.  Isn't it?  Roland's crazy.  Sam just watches us, waiting for us to fail the whole time.  You don't?  Never do?  Nope.  I saw Sam yesterday.  He wanted some chicken fingers, so he met me at a place at 51st.  I started talking to him about a restaurant business.  Five minutes, he was Facebook, and he couldn't get away from me fast enough.  He's like, I've got to go back to the office.  My foot hurts.  Oh, shit.  He couldn't take me.  Why, Sam?  Some cursing, racist stuff. 
[02:42:00]  He was just flipping out.  Oh, man, he gets enough of that during the show.  Yeah, he was trying to get away from that for an hour.  I need some peace in my life somewhere.  Jesus, Anthony, what are you doing here?  Roland ordered a wrap because he told me he was on a diet.  Oh.  Bullshit.  Roland ordered a wrap, and then he went home and had about seven beers.  Oh, shit.  I can smell the M&Ms in his pocket.  Yeah.  Where on the diet does it say, eat the buffalo spring rolls?  Oh, shit.  Instead of deep fried.  Plenty of blue cheese, too. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  It's a special occasion.  Huh?  Atkins.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, I can.  Atkins.  I know that dude died of a heart attack.  Really?  Picking Atkins, yeah.  Hmm.  All right, let's see this video of this six-year-old that's making believe he's two.  And as far as the news picking up on viral videos late, this was posted May 2009.  So that was originally put up in 2009.  Yeah.  So those kids like working.  Yeah.  He's listening appropriately.  All right, let's listen to this. 
[02:43:00]  Jase, what does George Washington say?  I cannot say a lie.  What does Abraham Lincoln say?  4, 12, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 7, and 8.  What does Nixon say?  I'm not quick.  What does Truman say?  Bomb those Japs.  What does Ronald Reagan say?  Yes.  Mr. Gordon's up.  Turn it around. 
[02:43:30]  What does the curtain say?  Blow me.  Suck my dick, you intern.  What does John R. Kennedy say?  Ow, my head exploded.  Where's Mimi Beardsley?  That's pretty good.  Okay.  What does George W. Bush say?  But he comes to go do for you.  What?  Okay, what does George W. Bush say? 
[02:44:00]  He fooled me once and not going to fool me again.  What does George H. Bush say?  We, my, with no blue taxes.  And what does our main man, Barack Obama, say?  Yes, we can!  Oh, shut up!  You fucking white guilt at two!  Yes, we can!  Blow me.  Very good.  Fuck you.  I hope to see you on a milk carton, you little bastard. 
[02:44:30]  I'm like, haven't done that in years.  The Clinton, and he did the Clinton fucking quote.  Wow.  Social relation.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yes, we can!  Yes, we can!  Yeah, lib, little fuck.  This is your video, though.  Yeah, man.  No, I'm backing out.  Uh-oh.  I forfeit.  No, we're in a big competition right now.  I forfeit.  I forfeit.  I forfeit.  You win.  He had to take a shot at W.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  With the fake laugh and everything.  Of course.  So you're taking...  It's just the liberal media bias.  Screw that. 
[02:45:00]  It is.  It is.  So you're taking the Sal way out.  I'm taking the Sal way out.  I don't give...  I'm committing.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Well, I'm taking on Anthony with the Hailstorm fucking woman video.  Oh, she rules!  God damn it.  This thing is going to be so viral.  Already started.  It's on Gawker, right?  This is good, yeah.  This thing is going to be so viral.  This is like bronchitis lady.  Yeah, I think she's...  Bronchitis.  Maybe it's because we're desensitized to black people.  Ain't nobody got time for that. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  I think she's better.  She is better.  Yeah.  Kabooya woman is great.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is going to be ridiculously viral.  Apparently they were interviewing her about a big hailstorm that came up.  Yes.  And she's obviously in some projects.  And, you know, she's a sassy black woman.  Have you seen this yet, The Cuban?  I can't watch this shit.  Oh, it's great.  Why can't you watch?  I hate all this viral.  I hate people that aren't talented on TV, on the web.  You can't watch anything anymore.  But she's talented. 
[02:46:00]  This is going to be viral.  Oh, yeah.  She's a black lady that's going to talk about something crazy, right?  Yeah.  Crazy.  But how big of a boner do the reporters get when they realize they can show black people  being, like, buffoons?  Being buffoons, yeah.  Yes.  We have no reason to interview anybody else.  This lady just has a big personality.  That's it.  That's all it is, huh?  That's all I'm looking at.  A big personality.  Play this thing.  Oh, this is anticlimactic.  Oh, fucking commercial commercial. 
[02:46:30]  What's happening with the inner tubes?  Across town, residents are now picking up the pieces as well.  Large hailstones, destroyed mobile homes, busted out windows, and cartel lights.  Man, them jokers was big.  Size of a quarter doggone.  Many.  She doesn't even know English.  Man.  Now, is the technical term, when it's, I know when it rains, it's raindrops.  Yeah.  When it's hailing, are they considered jokers? 
[02:47:00]  Them jokers are big.  Yeah, they are.  The technical term.  I love her.  Yeah.  When water vapor in the air solidifies, it's called a joker.  Oh.  Yes, yes.  Very scientific.  Let's hear her again.  I want to hear that part.  Man, them jokers was big.  Size of a quarter doggone.  Many.  A size of a quarter doggone.  He said it sounded like nothing they've ever heard before.  He said, kapooyah, kapooyah.  And the boy that hell just came in. 
[02:47:30]  I looked at my, opened my door, and I looked at my door, and started hitting me in my head.  I took out running, ran to my restroom, and then I called my mama to see what she all right.  See if she all right.  My God.  Kapooyah, kapooyah.  The end of the world.  Man, them jokers.  Man, they were big.  Kapooyah.  Wow.  She sounds like our old homeless friend there. 
[02:48:00]  You know what?  You gotta love it.  You've combined the internet with the phone cameras and stuff like that, and black people.  It's fucking a treat.  It's a treat.  Worldstar hip-hop.  Shit like that.  Right here on the stage.  Right here on the stage.  I bet Worldstar hip-hop isn't the only website that's having a field day with this clip.  Oh, no.  I could tell you.  I visited a certain website that, yeah, featured this prominently. 
[02:48:30]  Which website was it?  Niggermania.com.  Jesus.  It's astounding.  I need to make a shout.  It's crazy.  It's horrible.  Horrible.  They have all kinds of stuff on there that is just crazy.  Tasteless.  Tasteless.  Tasteless.  Tasteless.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, there's plenty of others, though, like black militant sites that I visit that  aren't too kindly to the white folk, either.  There's a race war going on on the internet. 
[02:49:00]  Take a dip into everything.  Yeah, a little bit.  I sample a little from column A, a little from column N.  That's what I like.  You should sample this salmon.  It's amazing.  Speaking of sampling something, my God, this filet mignon, it's amazing.  Kabooya.  Like my mother, Kabooya.  You know what?  They got mushrooms on here.  Get out of bed.  Mama.  Mama.  Red to my red shoe.  I call my mama to see what she up.  Well, not the first part where they talk about dumb hell.  And jokers.  Yeah.  No, further back, I think. 
[02:49:30]  Somewhere in there, right?  Kabooya!  Kabooya!  No, we're right.  Kabooya, Kabooya.  For that.  Remember, folks.  For that.  Kabooya.  You want to hear her talking about jokers, too?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Right from the beginning when she goes,  I bet you there's someone in the hood whose name is Kabooya.  Kabooya.  Kind of this crazy person.  Yeah.  She's giving him a shout-out.  Some pregnant woman just watched that news report and was, oh, my, what a beautiful name.  Oh, my name, I kid Kabooya.  Man, them jokers was big, size of a quarter doggone. 
[02:50:00]  Many said it sounded like nothing they've ever heard before.  They said, Kabooya, Kabooya.  And your boy, that hell just came in.  I looked at my, opened my door, and I looked at my door and started hitting me in my head.  I took out running, ran to my restroom, and then I called my mama to see what she all right.  See what she all right.  Yeah, a lot of people saying Tracy Morgan.  I hear it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  A little bit.  Kabooya.  Kabooya.  Kabooya.  That's some type of meteorological term, I think.  Yeah.  Kabooya.  Kabooya.  Could we get the Kabooya on our machines?  Sure.  Did you bring any Kabooya with you?  Because I like the steak, but I could really go for some hot, piping hot Kabooya.  That would be nice.  It's a Hawaiian dish.  The Cuban from Heartland Breweries are helping out your friend, I guess.  Yeah, they're good guys at Heartland.  Yeah.  They're good guys.  They make their own beer. 
[02:51:00]  What's your favorite sushi place in Manhattan?  The busiest one I can find.  I think it's all about, you know, your favorite sushi place.  If it's slow, don't go.  If it's slow, don't go.  Nice though, Ryan.  Whoa, that's pretty good.  I go to the busiest one I can find, because I know they're going through fish.  If it's slow, don't go.  Kabooya.  Damn jokers was busy.  Oh, man.  Busier than a quarter dag on it.  Yeah.  And spend money.  Go to the most expensive one, and then it's busy.  It shouldn't be cheap. 
[02:51:30]  Cheap condoms, cheap motorcycle helmets, cheap sushi, no good.  Cheap motorcycle helmets.  This guy's full of knowledge.  Yes, he really is.  I like it.  Kabooya.  Kabooya.  All right.  Yeah, that's it, man.  She is the shit on the inner tubes.  I think she beats out.  Yeah, Broncatus.  I said, Lord, it's a far.  Far.  I got Broncatus.  I ain't got time for that. 
[02:52:00]  I ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Well, we can do the Chris Christie thing, too.  Yes, Chris Christie was interviewed by kindergartners.  And it was a much more concise interview than I've seen with any press member.  He actually was answering the questions, which never happens with the politicians.  He went for that cute photo op.  Of course, with the little kitties.  Yes.  Did you come here in a limo?  No, I came in here something even better. 
[02:52:30]  I came in a helicopter.  A big double Rotor Sikorski.  That fuck.  Yes, I've gotten to meet the president a bunch of times.  I used to know how many times in my head I had met the president,  but now I'm going to have so many times that I can't keep counting anymore.  Because he's forgettable.  That's a word I've never heard. 
[02:53:00]  Enchanting.  Very nice.  Can you do math?  Do I do math?  I try not to.  I have a calculator that helps me with my math,  and I have a state treasurer who helps me with my math.  Yes.  What's my budget?  Let's see.  The budget right now is about $32.9 billion.  Did you?  What was I doing?  Taking up the whole screen.  Nothing?  Nothing.  I love that.  That's pretty usual. 
[02:53:30]  Did you hear what he said, though?  Taking up the whole screen.  She thought her TV broke.  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  I see a button and a belt buckle.  Yeah.  Sort of.  I hear the voices, but I don't see anything.  I would hire the Cuban in a second.  You want to do radio?  I wish.  It's better than cooking.  We'd easily get you a radio show around here.  Yeah, I mean, if you're talking about cooking and stuff.  Fuck the cooking part.  Oh, man.  Sammy hates talking about cooking.  Because he just eats chicken fingers. 
[02:54:00]  I know.  Yeah, I mean, I can't relate to anyone.  I'm talking to a prisoner.  He's also fucked up.  What do you need to take water and bread?  He's also fucked up from the Guy Fieri appearance.  Yeah.  Me and Guy Fieri.  He put you off of cooking and shit like that.  We are on better terms now.  But there'll always be that resentment.  There'll be animosity, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He made you drink vodka.  But we're on better terms.  Never get into a fight with him.  He kickboxes every day.  He'll fuck you up.  He does.  Yeah, I don't know.  No kidding.  Wouldn't take much to fuck me up.  I thought those were just rock and roll kicks.  Those are real kicks, huh?  I thought he was doing some DLR, but I'm a fucking rock star. 
[02:54:30]  He's strong, man.  He don't look it.  He's tough.  He don't look it.  He really doesn't.  You just start trying to get yourself into a fight.  No, man.  He's nowhere as close.  We were at the Food and Wine Festival, and I'm walking.  Michael Simon, the Iron Chef, and Guy are walking in front of me,  and I'm walking with this real douchebag Hollywood wannabe agent.  You know, like for all the guys, and he's walking with me.  So he's like, hey, I heard you were on Sirius Radio, you know? 
[02:55:00]  And I'm like, yeah, whatever, asshole.  So the guy goes, who's the Cuban?  I heard you're on Opie and Anthony.  He looks at me and goes, I fucking hate you.  Oh, shit.  I don't like it.  When does the story get good?  Oh, damn.  I'm sorry.  Damn.  I'm just fucking wrong.  Yeah.  The food was terrific.  The Cuban's terrific.  Should we take a break and then have Sal play us out with some drums, or what?  I guess so. 
[02:55:30]  That seems to be...  Are you ready to play us out with some drums, Sal?  Yeah.  Yeah, already.  You actually did this all yourself, huh?  Well, Mars helped me get the stuff, and yeah.  Good old Mars.  What?  Seven and eight.  Microphone.  Seven and eight.  Oh.  Good for you.  We're going on a break.  Sam, bad news. 
[02:56:00]  I didn't have time today to do the Sudoku puzzle, so I don't have one.  I don't have a new one, but I do have five SpongeBob SquarePants Band-Aids with...  The used ones?  Yeah, it actually has some of my hair on it.  You don't want to give the fans your DNA.  I ripped the fucking hair right off my arm, and they're on the Band-Aids.  Do you want to give these away today?  Yeah, I'll give away your DNA. 
[02:56:30]  That's what the reward will be.  Not the Band-Aid so much as your hairs and skin fragments are still on it.  That's what makes it valuable.  Yeah, they could take this fucking hair and put it on a dead hooker's body.  They could make a new Opie with it.  Son of a bitch.  I'm taking these Band-Aids home with me.  Smart.  You put a couple of these blonde hairs on a dead hooker's body, I'm fucked.  Yeah, but the dead hooker will look so pretty with those blonde hairs on her.  The Cuban understands, right?  Yep.  You understand that shit?  And all that shady shit. 
[02:57:00]  Heartland Brewery, thank you for the food today.  It was terrific.  Yeah, they're great.  And we paid for the food today, so relax down the hole.  Oh, really?  Did I get upset with that?  A little bit.  It's just food.  Why do they get upset with it?  Plug all up.  Tell them to go fuck themselves.  Tell them to just what Sal would say.  Fuck you!  Cuban, is it weird to be on a show without being severely intoxicated like Rollins?  I was drinking this morning.  Oh, you were?  Yeah.  Okay.  You drank in the morning? 
[02:57:30]  No, just today.  Why?  Because there was a bar and no one was watching it.  Oh, really?  I mean, what the fuck?  I'd be an idiot not to do something.  And you walked into the Heartland Brewery and said, look, I need food at 8 in the morning?  I called John yesterday, the owner, and I said, John, I need food for tomorrow.  And he's like, for who?  I'm like, go be an aunt.  And he's like, well, fucking call somebody and get it done.  Does he know who we are, even?  Of course he does.  Do people know who we are?  Everybody.  You got juice in this town.  I don't think so.  A little juice here and there. 
[02:58:00]  Chefs and restaurants.  We have pockets of juice here and there.  Are you guys hiring food delivery people?  I don't know.  Opie.  Yeah.  And I'm not even joking.  What, you want to do it?  I want to deliver food for a while.  Aren't you fucking rich?  I want to get a GoPro camera.  I'll get you one.  Don't do it.  I want to film the whole thing.  You're going to race the Mexicans up 43rd shit?  Yeah, all that shit.  You're fast.  I know.  I want to document it.  But I'm going to get one of those bikes where it has a little motor, but you can't tell it's  a little motor because they're trying to get to their deliveries faster.  You can't beat breeding, bro.  They've been bred for that shit. 
[02:58:30]  You can get the nice bike in the world.  They pedal for hours.  No, mine's a motorized.  I've seen the motorized.  They go flying up the street, but they have the pedals still so they don't get pulled over.  Oh, really?  You haven't seen those bikes yet?  They're pretty amazing.  They got tiny little motors on them, but they still have the pedals just in case a cop is  like, all right, what the fuck?  He goes, no, look, I'm pedaling.  That's crazy.  That's kind of dorky, the little pedals.  Don't do that.  You're rich.  I'm going to fucking deliver food in Manhattan for a couple of weeks. 
[02:59:00]  What?  It's so dumb.  Why would you?  You have millions of dollars.  Huh?  You have millions of dollars.  There's just no reason for it.  I don't know.  If I had $500 more than I have now, I wouldn't do the same.  That's all you need.  I'm a $500 away from fucking something.  Hey, we can get the Cuban out of his fucking job for $500.  $500?  That's it?  I'm gone.  He's gone.  I work in a call center somewhere.  So this show started with Sal. 
[02:59:30]  It was supposed to be like a talent show today.  But we're learning that no one around here has any special talents.  It's not.  I mean, they're just serious like some dozen higher talented people.  True.  We know that.  That's why the Cuban's going to get a radio show soon.  He's way better than half these guys.  Oh, I bet you might get it.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, see how I twist that shit?  Yeah, he's good.  He's quick.  He's good.  The Cuban's quick on his feet.  Why didn't he play the drums?  I've been listening the whole...  It's the whole thing.  He didn't play the drums.  No.  He was waiting, right?  I was waiting.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Sal. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, so...  Talking to the...  You again?  Yeah.  Seven and eight.  I put on seven and eight.  Talking to that.  That's on.  That's on.  Yeah.  But those aren't made to talking to right now.  Hello.  Hello.  So, you told us earlier, and then we had to talk you into it, and it took all morning.  Twist your arm.  We twisted your arm.  We did everything we had to make it clear that it would be cool if you played the drums,  considering you said you're really good at playing the drums.  So, you set up the drums in the studio for us. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Yep.  It's all set up.  Why do you think you're good at playing the drums?  I've been playing for a few years now, and...  A few?  What's a few?  A couple?  Several?  Thirteen, maybe.  Thirteen years?  Yep.  I took lessons when I was younger.  I took very formal lessons.  Did you show up?  Yeah, I did.  Oh.  I was taught by a woman, and I didn't even get to play the drums for, like, the first  six months.  I had to just, like, only play the practice pad.  It's like this rubber pad that you do all, like, the hand workouts with, and then...  I used to have to play that fucking pad in high school. 
[03:01:00]  I hated it.  Yeah, it's boring as fuck, but it totally gave me...  No way.  I never moved on from the pad, even though I wanted to fucking play drums, because, you  know, one of seven kids, my mom just refused to bring drums into our house.  So, you were just a pad guy?  I never graduated from the pad.  Yeah.  That's a stupid pad.  I wanted to play drums.  Yeah, man.  On a rubber pad.  It's so boring.  Paradiddled.  Paradiddles.  Paradiddles.  Doing paradiddlediddles.  The only good thing about the pad... 
[03:01:30]  And the worst thing about the pad...  I was terrible at drums, so I kept, like, hitting the rim, so you just hear the plastic  part of the pad, you know, the hard...  Uh-huh.  But the only good thing about the pad was you could draw wrestlers' logos on it.  Oh, jeez.  Now, you...  You...  How long did you...  What the fuck with the wrestlers?  How long did you play that pad that you got from the game show?  The drum...  Digital drum set?  Yeah.  I mean...  I don't...  There was certainly not one complete song played on that thing.  No.  It was just like, whoa, look at this.  It sounds like a drum. 
[03:02:00]  This one sounds like a cymbal.  It's crazy.  But you didn't play it?  No, no.  It just sat in the room, and, like...  Man.  I would just hit it, and I would make it sound like a cymbal.  So it was like...  Wow, that's cool.  Yeah.  You didn't do...  That never happened.  No.  I hate drum checks.  Fucking hate it up.  Sitting there, because, you know, being the singer of the band, I just had a look at the  microphone and go, yep, that's in the right place.  Right up front, motherfucker.  And then the drummers would be like... 
[03:02:30]  All right, kick.  Snare.  Go around the kick.  Hi-hat.  And you just sit like a...  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Took forever, huh?  I hate drum checks, and they would take forever! 
[03:03:00]  It was horrible!  We have to tune them?  They're drums.  I know.  They're tuning a drum.  I don't see strings.  Tune them, my ass.  And Roland is doing a sneaky Instagram shit as we broadcast.  What's he doing?  He fucking documents our whole show behind our backs.  He does?  Yeah.  On his Instagram right now, there's pictures of fucking the Cuban.  It's intrusive.  And Sal giving everyone the finger.  Very intrusive.  Very intrusive, Roland.  I know. 
[03:03:30]  That's the only impression I could do.  Yeah, nothing better than sitting around listening to that.  Tom 1.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  It's 1 and 2.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Oh, could I fucking just leave?  Yeah, stupid drum check.  RolandoS99 on the Instagram to see the picture of the Cuban. 
[03:04:00]  The Cuban.  Yeah.  Are you from Cuba?  No.  Or Cuba?  No.  Did any of your relatives come over on that flotilla?  No, but they fucking acted like it.  See?  Quick as fuck!  I was fucking animals.  Fucking bullshit mystery stories.  They came on a plane.  I'm like, this is all bullshit.  You came on a plane.  Shut up.  Fucking go to work, Dad.  Waterproof a fucking 65 Chevy.  Enough.  Bring it over.  No.  Yeah.  They're fucking miserable.  Rolando.  I can't fuck you with your boat.  Do they bitch about, like, the Castro regime? 
[03:04:30]  Well, they're hardcore Republicans.  They're the only Spanish people that are hardcore Republicans.  I grew up a Republican.  I think, though, there are...  That's why we have jobs.  I think there are a lot of Cuban Republicans, though, down there.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't like any of that fucking shit.  Right, right.  Like, guns, braces, Ronald Reagan tattoos.  Ronald Reagan tattoos.  Yeah, they got Nixon tramp stamps.  That's hilarious.  I grew up hating everybody.  You did.  It was awesome. 
[03:05:00]  Why?  Like, was it...  So now, but they were kind of considered a minority.  Cubans had money, and they got kicked out of their country.  Yeah.  So they got here, and the rest of the immigrants were poor people coming here.  Uh-huh.  So they hated them.  You know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They got here.  They started working.  They didn't take...  Cubans, very good work ethic.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We all work.  You know, it was selling cocaine on the streets, but quite a work ethic.  Smuggler's Blues?  Smuggler's Blues.  Be cool for 20 hours, and I'll pay you 20 grand. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Did you guys just love Scarface?  Was that like, yeah?  Oh, my God.  It was like a bedtime story.  Fucking true heroes.  We didn't watch Baby Einstein.  We watched Scarface.  Scarface.  Look how well he did.  Look, you have a fat one inside the house.  Look at those guns.  Those are German.  So how'd you get yourself up to New York from Florida?  No, I wasn't in Florida. 
[03:06:00]  My parents came to the Bronx.  All Cubans go through Florida.  No, my parents didn't.  They came to the Bronx, and then...  Wow.  Did they just wave at everybody down there in Florida when they were on the plane?  When I was nine years old, my grandfather told me, he says,  the whole family's telling you, Carl, that you're special, but you're not.  Oh, wow.  Your brother, he's special.  Really?  Wow.  And he said, so stop doing all that bullshit, telling everybody you're going to be a doctor  because you're like dumb as a box of rocks.  Holy shit.  Swear to God.  He said, either learn how to fix refrigerators or cook, and we have no one big in my family, 
[03:06:30]  so I would just default to cooking.  And that's all I started cooking.  That was it, huh?  And my brother's a cardiothoracic surgeon.  Oh, so they knew exactly what they were talking about.  Wow, they really knew.  They put all the resources with my brother, and now he loans me money.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, but you're kicking ass in the food business.  Yeah, but nothing like a cardiologist.  They put all their eggs in the right basket.  Yeah.  Apparently.  Wow.  That's good.  Good for him.  This has been a good week.  We have Denny now on the show and the Cuban. 
[03:07:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  We're going places.  I like it.  Finally, after all these years, we're going places.  I am so good.  We're going to take the show to the next level.  Oh, I can't believe it's a fucking weekend.  And just sitting back waiting.  It's time, I think.  Yeah.  Well, Sal's waiting behind the fucking drums, obviously.  I want to know more about the drums with Sal.  This is going to suck.  Sal played, um...  Have you been in bands?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I came on one time and showed you guys the band that I was in.  Oh, right, right, right.  That fucking video.  What about...  When was the last time you actually played in a band?  Quite.  Uh, it's been since college. 
[03:07:30]  It's probably about two years.  But I've been starting to write a new project with my buddy and should be playing some shows  pretty soon.  And do you rehearse?  I mean, do you stay in practice?  Do you have a kit that you play?  Unfortunately, I can't have one at my apartment.  Oh, wow.  So I usually just go to rehearsal spaces in, like, the Lower East Side.  Who's we?  Uh, me and my friend.  Oh.  Yeah.  What does he play?  He plays guitar, bass.  Yeah.  Yeah?  And you write?  Yeah.  You write music together.  What's the genre?  Uh, alternative rock, indie rock.  Indie?  Yeah.  We learned how, uh, hip and cool that word is the other day. 
[03:08:00]  Indie.  It's short for independent, by the way.  It's also called, uh, No One Will Ever Hear This Rock.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Can you sing, Sal?  No, not at all.  So you can't do a Phil Collins for us?  Nah.  Can you do the Phil Collins drum?  From in the air tonight?  Uh.  Well, yeah.  I don't really have that sort of kit here to do, but, you know, it's easy enough. 
[03:08:30]  It's easy enough.  That's like an electronic set, wasn't it?  Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you play?  Hold on, hold on.  Do you, do you play, uh.  Yeah, hold on.  We're not doing the big drum fucking.  Do you play electronic, uh, drums at all?  Mm, that's kind of douchey.  Boom, boom, boom.  Oh, that's perfect for you then.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  That's perfect for you.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Makes it so easy.  What a slap, what a side slap.  No?  Oh, yeah.  All that right in the face.  That stings. 
[03:09:00]  That's going to leave a mark.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, we should get the, the weekend started with the big, uh.  So what are you going to play for us?  Yeah, what are you going to play?  You want a song to play to?  I think that'd be the best thing.  Maybe do something by Rush or Muse.  Rush?  Which Muse song?  I'm a big Muse fan.  Yeah, which, which Muse song?  I would like, uh, Stockholm Syndrome would be pretty, pretty cool.  That would be fucking cool.  Stockholm Syndrome.  That's a good drum part in that song.  I think you got it, um, uh, Ant will definitely cue you.  Uh, I want to thank the Cuban.  Hold on, man. 
[03:09:30]  Ant's going to give you the big cue to start playing the drums.  Why?  Plus, Stockholm Syndrome is the whole reason that sound still works here.  Uh, song start, I forgot how that starts, actually.  Is it just start with a click?  It starts with, uh, guitar.  Guitar.  Guitar is the intro and then the drums.  And then the drums kick in, yeah.  All right, you know, you know where it is.  All right, so.  I don't need the ramp time on this.  Oh, you don't need the ramp time?  So, um, I guess, uh, Sal is going to play us out today on, what are we called today?  Talent.  Talent.  Talent Day Friday Initiative.  Right. 
[03:10:00]  Friday Initiative has begun.  That's right.  We're going to try to, like, plan Friday shows that are a little different than the weekly shows.  The rest of the week, uh, shows, whatever.  Yeah.  Thank you to the Heartland Brewery and the Cuban.  And without further ado, here is Sal finally stepping up and doing something for the radio show.  Can you do the, uh, yeah, the drum, the click, click, click before you start the drums?  It doesn't stop the click track, does it?  Yeah.  All right, you ready?  Let's see.  Fuck, the Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over. 
[03:10:30]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We got some planning going on in here.  Nobody's heard anything yet.  That's a good idea.  It is?  Well, Troy Kwan is, of course, the executive producer of Opie's Elevator Show.  And I think we're going to film one today, finally.  I took two weeks off.  You did?  Not really.  I got, I got, uh, uh, uh, a new episode of the Elevator Show up. 
[03:11:00]  And they can find that at Opie Radio on YouTube?  No.  Not Sam on YouTube?  No.  Oh, then where?  Not Sam on Twitter?  It's the thing I'm doing with E-bombs World.  Oh.  So go to our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, and click on my latest Elevator Show.  It's, uh, it's the one that some people have seen.  It's Bob Saget talking shit.  Oh, okay.  And it's doing very, very well.  Go to Facebook, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, I would think that would be a big hit.  Support the Elevator Show, even though it might be an older episode for some people, and just  fucking click.  For most of you, it's new to you. 
[03:11:30]  Right.  But, I, we're going to have a brand new, brand new, uh, Elevator Show, because I think we're  going to film Sal playing drums in the Elevator.  Right, Troy?  Yep.  Wait, wait, wait.  So, Sal...  We're going Gorilla.  We're all walking down with a piece of the fucking drum set.  You're setting up the whole drum set in the Elevator.  Yeah, we're going to go Gorilla.  And, we just did a thing on the show where you didn't let Sal play on the show, but you're  saving it for the Elevator Show.  The Elevator Show, way more important than the radio show. 
[03:12:00]  To who?  To me, personally.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Why?  Because I've become a star this way.  You're already a star, dude.  Yeah, but I'm like part of an ensemble.  You just need that...  I'm going solo.  Yeah, but what happens if people are like, yeah, the Elevator Show with Sal, the drummer?  Yeah.  Beautiful.  But then you're still part of an ensemble.  Not really, because it says Opie's Elevator Show.  It's Opie's branding.  He just needs that Opie name.  Yeah.  You know it says your name on the wall here.  Yeah, no, I'm past that.  You are?  Yeah.  That's old news. 
[03:12:30]  It is.  It's old news.  Yeah.  I've conquered radio.  You get this, Troy.  Well, of course.  This is the new shit.  I've conquered radio, now I'm conquering elevators.  It makes sense.  And Opie made me into a star on his Elevator Show.  He did.  You feel like a star?  His life changed for you?  Yeah.  Total of 80,000 views for Troy Kwan and the Miz's Elevator Show episode.  As the Miz would say, that's awesome.  And my followers on Twitter, Troy Kwan on Twitter.  That's right.  Through the roof.  Just blown up, huh?  Troy Kwan on Twitter, the executive producer of Opie's Elevator Show.  Is that in your profile?  Did he say that?  Late episode on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, click on that link.  Give me a click. 
[03:13:00]  Give me a click through.  I'm going to have a shirt made that just says, give me a click.  Yeah.  Check.  And on the back, it says, I'm checking my numbers.  Well, so when I check my numbers later, I go, fuck, they listened to me when I said,  just give me a click.  Right.  I got a couple of clicks.  All I'm looking for is a click.  How many times a day do you check your numbers?  Not as much, because I realized I was completely addicted to social media.  Yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't say that.  Is that not the case anymore?  I'm not even lying.  And that's not happening anymore?  Not as much.  No.  No.  I checked every half hour instead of every five minutes. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, okay.  I mean, that's still a huge problem.  You still think the E-Bombs World elevator show.  E-Bombs World.  It's more important than the giant SiriusXM show you do, where you have your own channel.  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  The internet's the future.  Is it?  Yeah.  We realize that.  You know, we're also online at SiriusXM.com.  On demand.  Nah.  No.  Give me a click today.  You're just looking for clicks.  Even though you know that I did that elevator fucking video with Bob Saget, just give me a  click today.  When does this happen?  When does this all go down? 
[03:14:00]  Well, the Bob Saget one's up.  No, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about-  Right now.  Oh, my God.  You're wasting our time.  So, where is-  Holy shit, Bill Bradley.  Well, get him and bring him in.  Bill fucking Bradley.  Dollar Bill!  Yell at him so I can hear.  Yo, Dollar Bill!  He just did it with the door open.  Is that what they used to call him, Dollar Bill?  Yeah, man.  He was the fucking-  He hurt you.  Ah, Roland's fucking with you.  He was fucking with you. 
[03:14:30]  He hurt me, buddy.  He did.  He must have heard you.  No, he hurt me, but then Roland made believe that he heard me and then decided to see where  that was coming from.  And then Roland fucking set me up bad.  You're playing for the Knicks.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I know who Bill Bradley is.  Dave DeBusher.  And we'll put Willis Reed in that lineup.  Dick Barnett.  I'm going to go with Jerry Lucas.  I think Earl the Pearl Monroe played with Bill Bradley.  That's when you were a big Knicks guy.  And I'm going to go with the Hawthorne Wingo. 
[03:15:00]  I've never heard that name before.  Did I look up any of this shit?  No.  I think every one of those names is correct.  They all played with Bill Bradley and the New York Knicks.  What year?  70s.  How'd you know about that, then?  Dad had the basketball games on.  Oh, well, I thought you were a child of the 80s.  Child of the 80s, yeah, definitely.  So then how'd you know about the 70s?  Because I was a child of the 70s, too.  Oh, like a little bit in the 70s.  The lower years were child of the 70s.  My, you know, the prime growing up year is child of the 80s. 
[03:15:30]  Troy, you were actually born in the 70s, correct?  Yeah.  But if Opie...  What?  But if Troy was born in...  You're a child of the 80s, Troy.  I'd say more than 90s.  Me and Troy are about the same age.  Wow.  I mean, I think...  A little off.  A couple years off.  Like, I think...  Troy was like a freshman when I was a senior in high school.  We went to the same high school.  Is that right?  Yeah.  You went to high school in Pennsylvania?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could have sworn Long Island. 
[03:16:00]  I remember Troy walking around the halls.  I was thinking, this kid's got something.  You didn't push him around because you were a senior?  No, he came to school with a skateboard.  You did?  You used to drive like Bart Simpson?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty badass.  Skating in the hallways.  Did you have like a skull and crossbone, except the skull looked like your head like Bart Simpson?  Uh, yeah.  I did.  You did?  You had that shit, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I didn't know you were only like three years apart, you two.  Yeah, three or four.  I guess something like that.  Yeah.  I mean, that's crazy.  Who kid is here?  I mean, yeah, because one of you is a different age. 
[03:16:30]  You want to do the elevator show today?  I heard you want to do it.  I could be naked on there.  If you want, we're going full drum set in the elevator today.  Nah, you're joking.  They're going to load a drum set in the elevator.  Screw Sam's show.  Let's go have some fun.  You're back and be in there like, ugh.  Obi's convinced that the elevator show is more important than the radio show.  Even though the show is still, even my show has his name on it.  I don't care.  Can you freestyle rap?  I could do it in French.  I could do it in French, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah, but are you going to be able to even hear him?  Well, if he's up and close to the French.  Wait, what do you mean in French?  Give me some French. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, man, that was pretty good.  Yeah, he's Asian.  We could use that in the elevator.  He knows all that shit.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Should we package it with the drum thing, or should we make that a separate episode?  I think that's a separate episode, because that's the thing about the elevator show,  is you've got to keep pumping these out.  If you use all your ideas in one show, then you're stuck throwing Bob Saget up every other week.  No, I've got only a few more left in the can, so the pressure is on.  Which is why.  I've got three more in the can.  You're talking about...  Because I need new episodes.  I'm actually taking the elevator show on location. 
[03:17:30]  Whoa.  You're talking about on location where?  I'm going to go to that construction site on 57th.  Have you confirmed that...  I'm going up that elevator 90 fucking stories.  Is it an outside elevator or an inside elevator?  Yeah, man, that's my fucking...  It's a construction elevator?  Yes!  I'm taking the elevator show on the road.  But who are you going to fuck with?  I don't know.  I'll figure it out.  It might just be a video of The View from an elevator.  Sometimes it doesn't have to be funny.  It just is interesting, entertaining.  Obviously, sometimes it doesn't have to be funny. 
[03:18:00]  That's the whole reason I'm here.  Well, he wasn't funny.  He was more shocking.  You should get like Kenny G on one of them elevators.  He's like, you know, since his music is in all of them.  Well, yeah, but I mean...  Imagine you just have Kenny G in the corner and people think it's through the system.  Yeah.  That would be gangster, though.  See, who kid's got to...  I'm hiring him for the elevator show.  Are you paying people for the elevator show?  I gave Troy a little taste.  He gave him a little...  A little brag about.  A little pocket money? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, I gave him some pocket money.  A little love.  A little how-do-you-do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grease my palms a little.  No problem.  Shit.  Let's go do the drum thing.  This will be the last elevator show we'll be able to do in this building.  You're putting an entire...  How are you going to get the drum set in the elevator?  We've got everybody sitting around in town.  Because it's a...  The Cuban's going to help us out.  Maybe we get there.  Roland.  Roland.  Roland.  You're taking literally all my after-show guests.  Yeah.  To put a drum set in the elevator.  Okay.  It'll take five minutes.  I would like to see it.  Who are these little kids? 
[03:19:00]  You'll see it on OP Radio.  Maybe they're...  What are you...  Who are these kids?  They want to do the after-show?  That's my son.  That's your son.  Okay.  They're very white.  I know you want to be white.  I know.  I don't think you're that white.  Those kids look important.  Yeah, I know.  A little kid wearing a polo shirt is always...  What is his arm's fault?  He's probably the next Justin Bieber.  They're showing him his future home.  Or his next Sal.  True.  A whole lot of nothing.  All right.  We've got some shit to do, Sam.  All right.  You're not taking Alan Thicke Jr. away from me, are you?  You may need Alan Thicke Jr.  Sorry, man.  Wait.  You're going to take Alan Thicke Jr. too? 
[03:19:30]  Well, because we have the people to carry.  So tell me, before you go, tell me how it goes down.  Because this is a public elevator in a big New York City building.  And in New York City, it's not like SiriusXM owns a building.  Right.  In New York City, they give floors to different companies.  So there's literally hundreds of people going to work in this building every day.  Yeah.  It's 10 o'clock in the morning.  And it's Friday, which means people are coming in now.  Because on Friday...  You're a little more lax.  You sleep in.  Is that right, Who Kid?  You get to come in a little late on Friday, right? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, you know.  CPT for everybody.  Am I right?  Tell me about it.  So you're going to be dealing with commuters.  So what do you do?  You call the elevator.  You hold the doors open.  And then all of you get a piece in.  Get a piece in.  Set it up.  And then just get ready.  Close the door and go.  So it doesn't matter who's in there.  Wow.  That's the game plan.  We got this.  I'll let you know how it goes.  I'll report back.  Yeah, definitely report back.  So, uh...  All right, good luck.  I'll see you later, huh?  No, you've got to stay here, Who Kid.  Who Kid's staying here? 
[03:20:30]  I don't think Junior is leaving.  Oh, okay.  I don't think Junior, you've got to do what you've got to do.  I hope he needs you.  He needs you.  It's his name on that wall.  So you're telling me they're going to have a live band with all those people going in there?  Going from floor to floor?  Not a full band, but Sal.  Are you serious?  You remember Sal, Who Kid?  Yeah.  He had a rough one today, dude.  He was, uh...  We really called him out for not being a good worker.  Get out of here, sir.  Yeah, we killed him for having no work ethic.  Because he doesn't have work ethic.  And Rob Cross is following Opie to the elevator. 
[03:21:00]  Rob Cross is supposed to be a boss.  Shouldn't he be stopping this from happening?  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  Mars was leaving my studio here with the door open as Rob was following.  He goes, hey, Opie.  And Opie just goes, busy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, I think he's coming into your studio, Eric.  I saw Rob walk that way.  Is he in there?  Yeah, he's in here.  Ask him what's going on.  What's going on?  Sam wants to know what's going on.  Nothing's going on.  Did you hear...  Does Rob know what Opie's about to do?  Do you know what Opie's doing?  I have no idea.  Okay, don't tell him.  Don't tell him then.  Don't tell him.  No?  Okay.  He's probably better off not knowing. 
[03:21:30]  Okay.  Is he going to do a drum solo in the elevator?  I don't know, Rob.  I can't tell you.  I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  What is he, like the snitch or something?  Snitches get stitched.  He's the boss.  I just put those two and two together.  Is that what's going to happen?  That'd be awesome.  Who knows, you know?  I can't tell.  Anything could happen, right?  They just walk down the hall with the drum kit and...  Exactly.  You got a drummer, a drum kit, and about seven guys who work for the show.  Anything could happen.  They're probably just going to put it away.  Probably.  Probably.  And as far as you know, as a supervisor, you saw them going to put it away, right?  I saw them headed toward the studio where it belongs. 
[03:22:00]  That's exactly right.  Legally.  It's about time.  Oh, my gosh.  You guys are having fun today.  Well, it's a Friday.  This is a Friday show.  I see this alcohol coming in here.  There was.  There was some alcohol a minute ago.  I guess they cleared out all the food when you got here.  The fuck?  They're like, no, who gets not coming in here again?  What happened to all the food, E-Rock?  I think, yeah, Rob's asking for the food, too.  I think Roland took it all.  He took it back to the office.  Why?  There's still people coming in here.  Rob needs to have a little something to eat. 
[03:22:30]  There's no Ciroc in here?  I don't know.  Go check the office.  You're trying to get some Ciroc, right?  Fez is in here now, too.  Fez wants food.  Fez wants a sandwich for himself.  Fez deserves it.  He works hard.  You want some food, right?  Free food?  Sure.  Exactly.  How's he going to say no?  No ham or nothing in here?  I like ham.  Okay, Rob's out of the office now.  Yeah, who can?  So here's what they're going to put an entire drum set in the elevator.  And go all out in there.  And then Sal's going to be in there doing like a drum solo while people go in and out of the elevator. 
[03:23:00]  So that's his punishment?  Or that's just part of his promo?  No, that's like congratulations.  You get to be on the elevator show.  You're a bitch today, huh?  Yeah, you get to play drums and disturb everybody.  Dude, there are people who work for banks who come in here.  What if he gets arrested?  Fuck it, right?  I mean, you got arrested.  You survived.  Yeah, I got credit, kid.  I got street credit.  Yeah.  Credit.  Speaking of credit.  You know, everybody gets credit when credit is deserved. 
[03:23:30]  Am I right?  Except black people.  Except black people.  Sometimes black people.  Do you like black comedy movies or white comedy movies?  Both.  I like both.  You do?  So you've seen movies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, stuff like that.  You like them?  Those are hilarious, yeah.  You like those movies?  Then who, kid, you're going to love This Is 40?  The latest hit comedy from Judd Apatow.  Oh.  Who, kid, what happened?  You're 40.  Yeah, I am.  You know the struggle.  When I get hard?  No, that's not what I'm talking about.  This Is 40 looks in on the lives of Pete and Debbie, played, of course, by Paul Rudd and 
[03:24:00]  Leslie Mann, a few years after the events of Knocked Up.  After years of marriage, who could you have had trouble with your marriage?  How do you handle that?  I don't fuck her.  Right, and what do you do then?  I whack off.  You whack or?  Fuck bitches.  Okay, okay.  Well, this couple deals with it a different way.  They do it a little more.  They're more of a comedy.  Your life is more of a porno movie.  Is that right?  Well, the black side.  But you talk about the white side.  Right, the white side.  After years of marriage, this couple, who kid, is struggling to balance romance, careers, 
[03:24:30]  their own aging parents, and now their teenage and eight-year-old daughters, all while trying  to figure out how to enjoy the rest of their lives, you figured it out.  Fuck bitches is the key.  That's it, bitch.  This is 40 features an all-star cast, including John Lithgow, Megan Fox, Jason Segel, Melissa  McCarthy, Lena Dunham, Graham Parker, and Albert Brooks.  This is 40, who kid, is an honest, candid, and heartwarming comedy about the challenges 
[03:25:00]  and rewards of marriage and parenthood in the modern age.  This is 40 takes us through Pete and Debbie's milestone meltdown.  Nah, kid.  As they each turn 40 while trying to navigate sex, romance, careers, triumphs, financial  hardships, and everyday life.  This is 40.  It's a very funny movie.  You've got to check it out if you haven't seen it.  Own it now with digital download or watch it anytime with movies on demand.  28 days.  28 days.  No way. 
[03:25:30]  Before Netflix or Redbox.  This is 40, so check it out.  Is it on Canal Street?  I don't know if it's on Canal Street.  Actually, it was on Canal Street before it was in theaters, so it should still be there.  That shouldn't be a problem at all.  On red carpet with Bumbata?  That shouldn't be a problem at all.  I'm going to call Bumbata.  Everybody's been asking about this mixtape that you're putting together, because I gave  the word out.  I saw on your Instagram that you mentioned you're doing a big Opie and Anthony mixtape.  Yeah, where I went on MTV.  I did a rap fix with Sway. 
[03:26:00]  You did?  I picked it up on there, because, you know, Opie heard, I mean, he Instagrammed me when  he heard the Biggie special I did.  He did?  Yeah, so he was like, yo, I love Biggie, man.  Opie said that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I was like, yo, I might as well just.  I thought he was more of an Allman Brothers guy.  He liked B.  I guess it was a New York thing, because, you know, his Instagram is full of, like, you  know, New York scenarios.  Where is he on?  On top of, like, goblins and shit like that?  He went to the top of the Chrysler building.  Where does he get these shots from?  He knows people.  He was trying to find out where's Brooklyn at. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he was looking for.  He couldn't find it from the top of the Chrysler building.  Biggie records, see?  Yeah, exactly.  Where's Brooklyn at?  Where's Brooklyn at?  Yo, I'm telling you, he called me, he was like, I love Biggie.  And I was like, yo, I'll just do a sample of these nuts, volume one.  That's the name of the mixtape?  Yeah, it was the opening Anthony mixtape.  It's called Sam, and all of you guys are hosting it.  Now, tell me, is it a tape?  Are you actually putting it on cassette tapes?  It's going to be, uh, it's going to be, uh, no, man.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:27:00]  Stop acting like a Japanese.  I don't know everything, Hooky.  You say mixtape, and I'm thinking, you know, double up the stereo speakers and...  Hiroshima shit.  Yo.  Try to figure that shit out.  A CD.  We're going to have hard copies, because the RIA is going to be some clearance issues online.  So, we're going to give away, roughly, I guess, like 10,000 copies on air.  We're giving...  I got to go through 10,000 phone calls?  You don't have to.  I mean, you know, randomly.  Oh, okay.  Some dickhead calls up here, and they're happy.  Just send it to them.  When are we going to get them?  I'm going to shut the fuck up. 
[03:27:30]  I'm going to shut the fuck up.  Yo, stop calling me, man.  You should just give one winner 10,000 copies.  Yeah, that's true.  That will be hell.  But that winner has to be from Canal Street, so he can unleash them.  We'll go back.  We'll go back.  Now, when are we going to get them?  Next week.  Oh, my God.  This is so soon.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I did the March 9th death of Biggie, the remembrance.  You guys are doing the birthday version of Biggie, which is May 21st.  So, you have until May 21st to get rid of 10,000 copies.  So, we'll have from now until May 21st...  Give it away.  Giving it away. 
[03:28:00]  Give it away.  Give it away.  Give it away now.  And the funniest drops were Anthony.  I was dying.  You liked his drops?  He was hilarious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, it's Opie, Anthony, Jim, me.  Who else is on there?  Oh, I forgot to give Roland a shout out.  Damn.  He doesn't get shouted.  You're on there, obviously.  Yeah, I'm on there talking shit.  But Roland doesn't get shouted out?  I forgot.  He's not going to be happy.  I gave fucking E-Rock like five shout outs, I think.  You did?  What?  Well, you heard about the E-Rock drunk show.  He deserves those shout outs. 
[03:28:30]  E-Rock, how do you think this Friday show measured up to last Friday's show?  Huge disappointment.  Really?  And why is that?  I don't know.  Who was the focus of the day?  Well, let me see.  What did we do today?  Was it your time?  Was it your day?  No, I mean, I told the story.  I did the human growth hormone thing.  Right, right.  You did.  What the fuck?  I'll tell you about that.  That was a segment, not so much the whole show.  Oh, okay.  And I thought that was a successful segment, right?  Yeah, it was something we didn't know about you.  I mean, we heard a little yesterday, but going more in depth today. 
[03:29:00]  It was entertaining?  Yeah.  Great, great, great.  Okay, that's what I strive for.  Okay, we also, I mean, they played, the Cuban was on here.  The Cuban?  Was it his day?  I guess it wasn't his day.  No, he just brought in the food.  We did the viral videos.  We played the Jay Leno.  It was Paul Rudd's day.  Paul Rudd, yeah.  Who, so you're saying, all right, somebody had a segment in the beginning of the show  that kind of wrapped around the whole thing last, was it Sal?  No, it was Sal.  Don't say that.  And how did Sal do today? 
[03:29:30]  Not good.  Oh, man.  I can't believe Sal sucks, man.  Get the panda angry!  That's his production.  That's Sal's production.  It's not good, is it?  What's going on here?  Well, see, it sounds like a lion.  But it's supposed to be a panda.  Right, it doesn't make any sense, does it?  And does Sal sound angry to you on that, or does he sound like it's just a wiener who's  yelling?  I don't know what's going on.  Right, yeah.  A wiener that's yelling.  It doesn't get the point across as a problem.  And a panda, they don't even roar. 
[03:30:00]  They just start eating leaves more aggressively.  Eucalyptus, whatever.  The shit they be eating, no.  Yeah.  Maybe we should have played this instead.  Sal's a cunt.  E-Rock has been all over Sal today, like white on rice.  E-Rock is, he's a conniver, though, because he's back in his little room.  And while, you know, I'm talking shit on the air, Opie and Anthony are, you know, doing  their show on the air, E-Rock is talking into all of our headphones.  Oh, really?  While Sal's in there, just jumping in with little tips. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, you know, da-da-da-da-da.  You know, da-da-da-da-da-da.  You know, I just heard da-da-da-da-da.  Look, the kid had a BMW until he moved into the city.  What am I going to support him with?  And that's what he's saying.  He's sitting there, and Sal's like, you know, oh, no, my family might have money, but  I don't have money.  And E-Rock is in my headphones going, he drove a BMW to his internship.  And I'm going, he's talking all kinds of shit in his lair back there.  The new shit?  The new shit?  He's talking all that new shit.  Back in his E-Rock cave, the fat cave. 
[03:31:00]  You can't talk back?  When he talks to you in the earphone, you can't talk back, like, shut the fuck up.  Not without doing it on the air.  Oh, okay.  E-Rock, I'm sorry, I called it the fat cave.  I was just thinking of things that rhyme with bat.  Let's go to 516 here on After Opin' Anthony Live.  My nuts.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I got a little, uh, I was listening to Who Kid yesterday on Shade, and he was talking  about abortion dinners.  I didn't know that you were supposed to do that.  Yo, can you explain to everybody about that? 
[03:31:30]  Abortion dinners?  I mean, uh, I took a chick out to get an abortion, like, a couple weeks ago.  I don't want you appearing on any other radio shows except mine.  Oh, sorry.  Okay, from here on out?  Not even his own shifts?  No.  From now on, I don't want to try and shake 45 anymore.  All right, so tell me about abortion dinners.  Nah, you know, I took her to have an abortion.  No, I don't know.  But come on.  You never had an abortion?  No, I've never had an abortion, nor have I ever had to have a woman that I was with  had an abortion.  A woman having an abortion means you're all having one. 
[03:32:00]  You have to take this bitch to the fucking clinic.  Oh, oh.  Nah, this is not my wife here.  This is like a bitch that I beg, you know what I'm saying?  So, I took her, and then, you know, she don't speak English from Venezuela.  That's where the bitch, as you said, was from?  And, you know, usually Spanish chicks keep their babies, but I kind of, like, manipulated  her.  I told her she has a big future at her.  Meanwhile, she's stupid.  So, you're telling me, Puga, you see this girl, you impregnated her.  Does she have a future?  No, she don't.  She's a stupid person.  And I was scared out of my mind, so. 
[03:32:30]  Uh-oh, Obie's back.  We're in so much trouble with the building.  Are you really?  Yeah.  What happened?  I think the elevator show's done.  Oh, no, no.  Speaking of an abortion.  I knew we had to fly under the radar.  Do we need to have an abortion dinner for the elevator show?  I knew it.  For the elevator show?  This is stupid.  I've got to film a few more episodes before I go big.  What happened?  They're fucking pissed.  Who is?  There's some guy around here who's yelling at me.  I didn't even, I just made believe he wasn't talking.  Did you give him the, do you know who I am experience? 
[03:33:00]  You just put him on the pay no mind list.  He gave us the, on what planet was this a good idea?  Who said that?  Who said it?  Troy will know.  I've seen the guy around a million times.  Is he security?  No, he's one of the guys who works on the floor.  Who said on what planet did you think this was a good idea?  Who said on what planet was this a good idea?  He's so pissed.  I don't even know the guy.  No, that's, that's, that's the head of, uh, production here.  He, he handles all the, uh.  Are you fucking serious?  You want to know Mitch?  No, no.  I don't know if he wants his name on there.  Oh, okay. 
[03:33:30]  He hasn't been on the show before?  No.  Okay.  He's extremely pissed, but I wouldn't give him anything.  I wouldn't even look at him or acknowledge that he was talking.  Okay, so walk me through this.  You guys.  He was so pissed.  This is the beauty, you know, of the whole thing.  Actually, I hate to say it, Sal could really play the drums, first of all.  Yeah.  Second of all, no one would get on the elevator.  They would panic and run away.  So you got, you, you got as far as getting the, the drum set in the elevator.  It was in the elevator.  We went all the way down twice.  I told Troy we can't go all the way down, but he, something happened and we went all  the way down.  He's the EP.  He makes the decisions. 
[03:34:00]  There's two elevators out.  Oh, no.  So the elevator guy's like, what the fuck?  We need every elevator today.  Wow.  So that was our first.  And then one security guy's like, I can't let you guys go back upstairs.  We're like, look, we're just, we're just going to fucking, um, uh, bring the drums back  upstairs.  He wouldn't let us.  And it was, I'm calling the supervisor.  So we're like, the building supervisor.  So I'm like, oh, fuck.  And then three or four other security guys, they're in my face, really pissed when they  walk and talk to me.  I'm like, and then I have to hear that guy walking down the hall.  It's giving me, you know, an attitude, but I would refuse to acknowledge him. 
[03:34:30]  He's like, on what planet was this a good idea?  He's a guy.  He just always has a lot of attitude.  And he's just one of those guys that just keeps angry.  And he's grabbing the drums aggressively, like, follow me.  I'm like, fuck you.  Who are you?  He's like a pussy.  I don't answer you.  Did he have any authority or was he just mad?  I mean, he has a little bit of authority, but he just, he just got shitty about it.  And he's like, he's like, just likes to shake his finger at people.  In what world is it a good idea to take wooden instruments in 20 degree weather?  And I was like, it's not 20 degrees in the fucking elevator.  Exactly.  How about, how about every world? 
[03:35:00]  It's a great idea to put a drum set in an elevator and watch people be like, why the fuck is this happening?  I'll tell you what, in Opie's world, it's perfect.  This is what I live for.  Yeah.  So then we're like, ah, fuck, we're going to have to deal with buildings.  You know, the supervisor, he's the main guy, right?  And I'm like, ah.  And then the one guy's pointing at me like, you've been a problem for a long time with your video camera.  And I'm like, all right, relax.  Who said that?  One of the other guys.  One of the security guys.  Of the building.  Somebody that recognized him from doing this.  But not a SiriusXM person.  No, no, no.  So then we're in this area, this building I've never been before, basically where they bring shoplifters. 
[03:35:30]  That's insane.  There was a secret door.  The little airport security room.  There was a secret door.  Like a door that you wouldn't think was a door, and he pushed it and went into a secret area.  Secret door.  Whoa.  Secret fucking door.  And what are you thinking when this is happening?  So that, I don't give a fuck.  No, we don't care.  Well, and they said, they go, we're going to need all of your pictures and all your IDs.  Sam, as soon as they took us to the secret door, Opie just looks at me and just  winks at me and just grins.  I'm like, Opie, I think we're in trouble.  I said, I'm panicking. 
[03:36:00]  I said, I live for this.  Who cares?  Who was there?  It was OBD, Sal, and then the guy with the attitude on this floor that said, what plan?  Was this a good idea?  The initial guy, Sam, the initial guy who unloaded us off the elevator, took the floor  top and just threw it into the elevator base.  He's pissed.  What did he throw into the elevator base?  He took floor tom, the big drum, and just pulled it right into the elevator.  Oh, okay.  Like the thing that you kick.  No, no, no.  The big tom on the floor.  The floor, yeah.  Oh, okay, okay.  You just play like this.  Gotcha.  And then Opie's like, you're throwing around our drums. 
[03:36:30]  We're going to break them.  You're going to try to turn it.  Because he kind of pushed one out of the elevator there right, and it fell over.  I go, now we've got a problem.  You broke one of our drums.  I'm trying to make it his problem.  Yeah.  Even though we broke, I guess, a bunch of rules.  And the guy's trying to rip us out of the elevator.  He's like, come on.  And Opie's like, no, no, don't worry.  We'll just take it right back up.  We're fine.  We're fine.  Opie didn't.  Opie wasn't happy.  He was unflappable.  No, we had to get another shot.  Completely.  Was he nervous, Opie?  No.  Not even close.  The Cuban wasn't there to see it?  They stayed upstairs.  That was probably smart. 
[03:37:00]  That was probably smart.  We didn't have any room.  There was room for two people.  What?  They freaked out.  Who did?  The engineer people.  They were like, who did this?  What's going on?  I went, I don't know.  I saw you.  I go, I know.  Who did?  I go, I don't know.  What do you know?  I go, I don't know.  They just walked away.  Yeah, the guy was really bitchy.  He's like, you took this drum out in 20 degree weather.  I was like, dude, I own two of these exact same drums you could have.  And he goes, I don't want your kid.  I don't want your kid.  I did the math.  I was like, I'm the only minority that's going to be on this elevator.  I'm going to jail. 
[03:37:30]  I'm out of here.  And like you said, it's not 20 degree weather in the fucking elevator.  He's just blowing off steam, trying to sound all angry.  Nobody gives a shit.  You got no real responsibility here.  Is that the sound of the drums being played in the elevator?  It's so loud, dude, in there.  It's ridiculously loud.  I would imagine it was loud in here.  We hear it all the way up.  And it just echoes through the entire shaft.  It's like in excess of some.  I heard that.  I like that.  Is anybody in there with you or is it just you guys?  No one would get on with us.  Yeah, nobody was getting on.  I don't know if it's going to make the elevator show, to be honest with you. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, man.  It might just be a great story.  Did you film any of the trouble?  Not really.  I was like, dude, are you rolling?  And he's like, no, I had to shut it off.  That's why you're the EP, Troy.  I love that shit.  I love when it's still rolling, you can hear the guy screaming at us.  But I don't roll when I know I'll never be able to use it because it's too frustrating.  Because I know there's no way they'll let me fucking put that up.  Anyway, so then we're in this secret area where they take the shoplifters and waiting  for the freight elevator with the secret wall.  That was cool as shit.  Were you punished? 
[03:38:30]  Were you reprimanded?  All the other security guys like this, right?  With their arms folded, fucking piss.  And then the SiriusXM guy fucking piss because he's like ready to throw us under the bus.  The production guy.  Saying, what plan?  Was this a good idea?  And I don't know what the fuck he said.  So then the supervisor walks through and he goes, you ready for the punchline?  He goes, ah, man, big fan.  And he goes, that's cool.  And he like escorts everybody.  And then the SiriusXM guy, fucking pissed because he thought he had me.  You've learned two things.  He was like, I can't wait for Opie to finally get a talking to. 
[03:39:00]  And he was pissed that we're all not in trouble anymore.  You've learned two things.  He wanted us to be in a lot of trouble.  And I'm sure he's going to his supervisor to complain about us.  Number one, the radio show is pretty important.  Of course.  Number two, you still got juice in this town.  Of course.  Do you know how great it would be if he actually got banned from the building?  He goes, first of all.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  He goes, big fan.  And reaches his hand out.  He's got good comedic timing. 
[03:39:30]  You get to meet the host.  And I don't know why the guy that's up here is pissed.  It's not his fucking drums.  He didn't pay for them.  I don't know why he's pissed.  What does he have to do with it?  You know why he's pissed?  He's not in trouble.  Well, he runs that department.  I'll explain to you why he's pissed.  Because when you get pissed, you get to have this feeling of, I'm the boss.  And, you know, I'm over you.  He gets to shake his finger like he's somebody's dad.  Did he acknowledge that he was talking to you?  No, not even.  Not even close.  Opie was laughing.  Opie was grinning and laughing the entire time.  Opie's like a kid going, I live for shit.  So this guy tried to be the dad and really reprimand Opie. 
[03:40:00]  And Opie's going through his terrible twos.  So he was having none of it.  He's looking at me and he's like, why would you think this is a good idea?  And I just didn't even answer much.  No, you're cool too.  Troy was cool.  Sal was panicky.  Oh, yeah.  Sal thought he was going to get fired.  He might still.  We might have to fucking throw someone on the bus.  Well, that would be great too if they were like, look, Opie.  We know it's funny.  It's a good joke and everything.  But somebody's got to be punting.  Do it, Sal.  Sal.  Do it to Sal.  Sorry, Sal.  Sal's going to take it for the team.  Would you take it?  Yeah, I was on playing the drums.  I mean, you really wouldn't have a choice, would you? 
[03:40:30]  They'd just fire you.  It's not like.  And you're fine.  Your parents are rich.  Yeah, you're good to go.  My parents bought me two of those drum sets twice the size of that fucking kid.  All right.  Well, that's then, you know.  I think we can use the footage as a little after thing.  You know, the logo comes in and then you give them a little extra.  Yeah.  That's what we're going to do with that.  That could be the abortion of the elevator show.  Right.  Right.  I just don't mean an elevator show.  Let's go.  No, let's do it.  I could go in there.  They're not going to fuck with me, though.  They might.  What? 
[03:41:00]  You would say that to them?  Yeah.  But Sam, secret fucking wall.  Amazing.  The whole secret elevator.  Where's the secret wall near?  I can't say.  Top secret.  I can't find that out.  We might need it.  We were in the freight elevator.  Are you serious?  That's like the top.  That's what they bring up like.  Howard Sternan.  And all the big name celebrities.  Lady Gaga came up.  Oh, yeah.  We were in the Lady Gaga secret wall elevator.  Oprah.  Oprah, and the Series X7 guy is seething.  He's so mad that I'm in no trouble.  We're in the freight elevator, and they even start joking, like, oh, man, the acoustics 
[03:41:30]  in here are pretty good.  Who said that?  One of the guys.  It's like, you know, it's too bad you didn't do it in here.  The acoustics in here are pretty good.  So can't pose a picture of you guys in the elevator?  Oh, yeah, pose a picture.  Because anybody who says that it's not a good idea to pick up a drum set and put it into  the middle of a busy elevator during morning rush hour.  That really sounds normal.  It's a guy I don't want anything to do with.  It's a fantastic idea.  That's why Troy was made executive producer of only the internet's hottest new show. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  The Opie Elevator Experience.  Woo!  Wow.  People forget where we fucking work.  Yeah.  This isn't like, you know, Morgan Stanley.  We're not four floors down.  We're 36, bitch.  You know what I mean?  Like, have a little bit of fucking fun.  Relax.  Yeah.  Get the fucking butt plug out of your ass.  Yeah.  Do you think he might have had one in?  I don't know.  I mean, it's uptight.  Like, relax, dude.  Do I know him if I saw this guy?  Yeah.  You tell me after.  Yeah, of course.  Do I know him by name?  I don't know.  I can't wait to find out who it is. 
[03:42:30]  Just to know.  Yeah, he never really has given me anything over the years.  I already understood his whole vibe.  Right.  So what do they do?  Do they roll back up with you, or do they let you go up by yourself?  Yeah, we went up by ourselves.  Well, we went down, and they were like, all right, you guys can't do it.  Dude, we almost were fucking free.  Because they let us go, and we're like, all right, man, we're just going upstairs with  the fucking drum kit.  But, of course, they were like, hey, we're fucking free.  Why don't we film some more?  And Troy goes, aw, shit, we're going back down.  Because I thought, I was like, okay, we'll stop on the 26th floor, because that's where 
[03:43:00]  the elevator ends.  Yeah.  And I thought you could just reverse it, and then go back up.  Yeah, but if somebody on the first floor hits the up button before you get to the 26th,  it's going down.  Oh, shit!  So guess who's waiting for us when the fucking elevator doors open, because they're wondering  who's going to have to come back down.  There were four guys just sitting there.  And then the one guy throws our drum out, and I said, well, you're going to fucking pay for  that.  You said that to him.  I'm not having to replace that drum.  It was so funny.  And who's the one who did it?  Was it the security guy who did it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I turned it, though, did I, Sal? 
[03:43:30]  That was great.  He was all panicky, like, you might have to pay for a drum.  Because you realize, he just fucking wung this thing right into the middle.  Yeah, because he's trying to be a tough guy.  And he goes, oh, you just fucked their drum up.  You know that.  You're going to pay for that.  And he goes, uh...  Noxious.  He goes, take the drums off the elevator now.  And we're like, oh, we'll just go back up.  He's like, I'm not asking you.  I'm telling you.  I'm like, oh, we'll just go back up.  You said that.  And he's like, I'll get them off now.  And then he starts ripping them off.  Like, you were all just team no respect.  We got it.  Don't worry about it.  Because Opie's cool.  And if Opie's cool, I'm cool.  We're just like, go.  Chill out.  As long as Opie's cool, you guys are in the clear.  Like, because at the end of the day, no matter what you do, if you go into somebody's office 
[03:44:00]  who's a boss here, and you go, Opie asked me to, you're done.  You're in the clear.  That's it.  Maybe.  And also, if you look guilty, like, if you look like you were doing something wrong, then it  makes you look even more suspicious.  But if you're just like, ah, whatever.  Just have some fun.  Dude, it's cool.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's good.  Don't worry.  So if anyone out there has an elevator I could use for my elevator show, this would  be the time to start fucking letting me know where I could go.  This is it for you. 
[03:44:30]  I mean, you could go up to my building.  It's only three stories, and it's in Westchester.  I can handle that.  And I could do a few in my building.  Yeah.  Although, it's your building.  Who cares?  You're going to fuck with your neighbors?  You see them every day.  They've never acknowledged me.  I've been there four years.  They still haven't said hi.  So if you're not going to make a friend, you might as well make an enemy.  Yeah, who cares?  Who can understand?  That's your philosophy.  I understand that shit.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  That was fun.  That was fun.  I don't know if I have any good footage, though.  That doesn't matter.  You had a great story.  Let me see.  By the way, Opie, we just found out while you were gone, the Opie and Anthony Deez Nuts 
[03:45:00]  Sample Deez Nuts mixtape.  Be out next week.  Oh, really?  Drops next week.  But we didn't really do much for it.  No, it's hilarious.  That's the way mixtapes work.  Like, they say, like, hosted by, and you literally hear two words out of this person's  mouth.  That's hot.  Yeah.  I just dropped a new mixtape.  You did?  The Ratchet Party mixtape.  It's on my SoundCloud.  Oh, shit.  You get that shit for free at SoundCloud?  Download it.  Troy Kwan?  Yep.  Download it for free.  I'm going to have to be in there.  I'm going to have to be an editing genius to make something out of this one. 
[03:45:30]  Troy's like a club kid, though.  And when you hear it, you're going to be, like, peeing on yourself like R. Kelly.  I threw some hip-hop in this one.  You did?  Got some Danny Brown.  You like Danny Brown?  Danny Brown's the shit.  He's missing, like, a little tooth, but he's cool.  Yeah.  He's not as cool as Trinidad James.  I wish Troy would have snuffed one of the security dudes.  That would have been classic.  Were you considering snuffing anybody?  No, not for one second.  You should have just snuffed him.  Snuffing a security guy.  Snuffing a security guy.  That guy at the end, man, he was pretty big, and he wasn't fucking around.  Well, yeah, but Opie had already pissed him off.  You know when they take their, like, security suits off their ghetto, man? 
[03:46:00]  Oh, it's on.  Big-time ghetto guys.  I know.  I'm not stupid.  They're not fucking around, man.  They don't.  No, man.  And Opie had already annoyed him by saying, well, you've got to pay for that drum if you  ruin it.  Oh, I got him so bummed that that drum tipped over, he knew.  It's like, fuck.  He lost all his power.  Being obnoxious.  I love Opie turning it around to try to make it their fault.  Yeah.  Well, things people don't realize about Opie is he don't give a fuck.  No.  No.  It's great.  I love it.  No.  Well, you know, daytime, you know, everybody's in here.  The Illuminati's going to work. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, the Illuminati's going to work, and there's a drum set in there.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  This was at 915 when they heard.  They said they could hear it on a lot of floors.  Oh, and I guess it echoes up the elevator shaft.  And by the way, if you go to our lobby downstairs, it's huge.  It's massive.  Right.  And when he was playing, you could hear it ricocheting through the whole fucking building.  Yeah, because it's got these high ceilings, so it echoes like a church.  Yeah, like if you yell, you'll hear it echo.  So, I mean, it was just drums.  And what's louder?  Like a typical person yelling or somebody in an elevator playing a full drum set? 
[03:47:00]  Well, I mean, you've got a bigger range of spectrum of sound.  So probably the drum set.  Highs and real lows.  Probably the drum set.  And hitting a snare drum, man, that just bounces off walls.  Keep talking about the drums in the elevator.  It'll make it a hot video.  Hang on.  I don't know if this is.  It'll be a very hot video.  I don't know if this is real.  Jim?  Yeah.  Are you the service guy for the construction elevator?  Yep.  And at the building where Opie wants to go on 57th Street?  Yep.  Opie, the guy who's the.  Can I go today?  I'd have to make arrangements because you need the ID to get in. 
[03:47:30]  Can I go next week?  We can work on it.  And do you need ID for the drum set?  This is my on-location elevator show.  I'm setting this shit up right now.  Jim, when can I go?  Let me make some calls and I'll get back to you next week.  Any day next week, all right?  Except Friday.  I might go to Boston to see Jim Norton.  What time are you talking?  Right after the show.  You know, I'll get over there nice around 945.  All right. 
[03:48:00]  What?  After the show?  It's only 10 o'clock.  How are you going to get there before they get there?  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  A quarter to 10.  Anywhere is from like 958 and 1030.  But 1030 is when he'll be there, Jim.  The show ends at 10 o'clock.  He might go a little over and then he'll get there.  It'll be 1030.  That's 10 blocks.  I could do that fast.  All right.  So 1020.  Between 1020 and 1030 is when he'll be there, Jim.  Who can give me a ride there quick?  I got you.  Who doesn't have a license? 
[03:48:30]  That's all right.  For what?  Get locked up together.  I got him.  We're just going to change the name of the elevator show to the Who Kids Car Show.  We'll just drive around illegally filming shit.  Do you know what the Who Kids Car Show is called?  What?  Cops.  It already exists.  Oh, shit.  Racist.  That wasn't a black thing, Who Kids.  I mean, you were in jail two months ago.  I love that, yeah.  Look at his watch.  Goddamn.  Yeah, he shows off.  It's my Friday watch.  All right, Jim.  So you'll hook it up next week? 
[03:49:00]  Jim, I got your...  I'm serious.  I'll be well behaved.  I want to check this out.  Oh, yeah.  No, there's some good views from up there.  All right.  So when are we doing it?  Like next...  Like you said, I got to make some calls and see what I can do, and I'll get back to  you on Monday.  Can I bring some naked black bitches up there?  That'd be ill.  What day is today?  What day is today?  Friday.  The actual day.  22nd.  22nd.  So this is a new text.  Why don't you read this text there?  Yeah, let me check it out.  Let me give it a look-see.  Make sure you read who it's from, and make sure you read it properly. 
[03:49:30]  It is...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I don't want to read this.  You have to.  Oh, shit.  Or I'm fired?  No.  That's stupid.  Justin Steng...  By the way, you have Stengel spelled wrong on your phone.  So there you go.  Do I really?  It's not Stengel.  It's Stengel.  Oh, with an A?  Yeah.  Oh.  Thanks, Jim.  All right, Jim.  It's...  He writes...  Wait, from Letterman.  You got to say Letterman.  Justin Stengel...  Justin Stengel...  Head writer for Letterman and also now doing side projects for...  Head writer, executive producer of David Letterman. 
[03:50:00]  Okay, listen up on this one, please.  Read that shit, bitch.  He texts to Opie.  Wow.  The elevator show is the greatest idea for a show.  You are a genius.  I wish I thought of it.  Give me my phone back.  That's from Justin Stengel, the head writer, executive producer of the David Letterman show.  Letterman, bitch.  Letterman.  I'm going to have to fucking read this to someone, some big fucking wig in this building.  Yeah?  So I can continue this show. 
[03:50:30]  Why don't you text Justin Stengel back and be like, if it's such a good idea, give me  a segment, bitch.  No, this is what I write.  All right.  Well, you're going to write back to Justin Stengel, as you call him.  I'll do it live for everybody.  Fuck it.  We'll do it live.  I'm just writing, I know.  He wrote it.  I bet Justin has to pretend like he thinks it's a joke, like it's not obnoxious that  he wrote that.  This is why you lose friends.  That's the simple shit.  You know what I'm saying?  One day, one day, Justin Stengel is going to get fed up with you and be like, yeah, remember 
[03:51:00]  all those asshole texts that you sent me, like it was a goof?  Yeah.  You're a fucking asshole.  I don't have reaction shots.  Can we fake reaction shots as the executive producer of the elevator show?  It's hard, man.  You've got to catch the real deal.  I got a couple people running away.  They were trying to get on, and then they quickly run out of the way.  Yeah.  I think I might have captured that.  Who wouldn't want to get in an elevator with a drum set?  That shit's hilarious.  If I was going to work, I'd be like, oh my God, there is one moment of my mundane, unimportant 
[03:51:30]  life that might be noteworthy.  There's a drum set being played in this elevator.  There is something to my day that won't be exactly the same as every other day of my  life.  People panic with that, though.  It's different.  Change.  Drums.  Loud.  Loud can't handle this.  This is unpredictable.  I got to get out of here.  Can you imagine the doors opening on a floor and how loud it would be in a floor?  I can imagine, but I couldn't know unless I was there.  That's insane. 
[03:52:00]  It was good.  It was fun.  It was a lot of fun.  But people don't know how to have fun around here.  Yeah, because they walk into this building, and they're like, I'm not supposed to be having  fun.  What is this?  Especially the SiriusXM guy.  On what planet?  I don't know.  The planet of fun?  That dude, that is not in his vocabulary.  I can guarantee that.  No.  Exactly.  And now, you know, he's in a room right now, fucking just trying to figure out how  he could get me in trouble.  And guess what?  He's going to go for the big fish.  He ain't going to go for a sow.  He's trying to get me in trouble.  And it's going to drive that motherfucker crazy, because he's going to realize, and he's 
[03:52:30]  probably listening to this right now.  Who gives a fuck?  He's going to realize he can't get you in trouble.  He can't get you in trouble.  You know why?  Why?  Because they already put your fucking name on the wall.  You're not getting in trouble.  That's right.  You don't care what some guy says who doesn't know enough astronomy to know that this is  fun on this planet.  Oh, you got a guy that I could use.  I got you.  Something I could just drop, make it look suspicious.  I gave one to Anthony the other day.  You gave him a gun.  Yeah.  Illegally.  Some illegal shit.  You did.  Who's the one with the booty, man? 
[03:53:00]  That's Fez.  No.  Fez got a butt shot?  There's some booty out there.  Who's the girl that was in shape?  Gays love that.  You got a...  Seriously, who's the one with the booty?  Video ho?  It's too late.  She's gone now.  Video vixen?  She's got the streaky blonde hair.  Half her head.  Probably rat moisture or something.  Some kind of rat moisture?  Off-wife Atlanta or some shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know who kid had to take his Venezuelan bitch for an abortion?  Nice.  And traditionally... 
[03:53:30]  What?  And this is a stupid bitch.  This is not a girl with a future.  Yeah, this is not my wife.  And when was this?  Recently?  Yeah, it was like a couple weeks ago.  Okay, and that's not your wife?  Yeah, definitely.  Okay.  No, you're still married.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  And does your wife know that you had to take her for the abortion or...?  Hell no.  No.  Why would you tell her?  See you later, Cuban.  Cuban?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  All right.  He's not here to talk about who kid's infidelity and abortion.  He's here to talk about food.  Cuban might have gave me an out on the fucking video. 
[03:54:00]  Thank you.  Blame it on me.  What'd you say?  This is crazy shit or something like that?  Yeah.  Cuban.  You're Cuban.  He was going to blame it on you anyway.  You know it's going to happen.  He was like freaking out.  I'm going to get that guy that was saying, what planet was this a good idea on?  I'm going to get him in trouble with Scott Greenstein.  Go down to the bus before he goes down to the bus.  I'm going to tell him Greenstein, how dare one of these underlings fucking talk to me like that?  Drop it, Opie.  Does he know who I am?  And then I'm going to go, what the fuck are you going to do about it?  Because if you don't do something about it, I'm fucking leaving. 
[03:54:30]  How about that?  I quit unless you do something about it.  You do something about that shit.  But who kid was telling me that it's tradition.  I'll put my butt off around here and I'll have to deal with that.  Post free content I'm giving to people.  It has nothing to do with my job description.  Post abortion dinners.  Did you know about that?  No.  Really?  I mean, you know, it keeps everybody mentally stable because, you know, she got the abortion.  Now my life is back because I thought I was going to pay for this fucking kid.  And that would have been one that you'd probably have to explain to the wife. 
[03:55:00]  So did you splurge for the dinner?  I took her to P.O.P.O.  P.O.P.O.  That's a great spot.  It's a good spot.  But it's P.O.P.O.  I thought I was evil.  I was like, what?  P.O.P.O.  P.O.P.O.  Is not an expensive spot.  It's Peruvian.  It's a chicken place.  Best chicken ever.  It is really good.  When you go Peruvian, you're showing your care, though.  Is that right?  Yeah.  17 bucks.  What are you doing blasting in bitches, man?  Nah, you know.  He's black.  That's right.  You've got to understand.  As much as he says he's white, he's a black dude.  I do it every five years. 
[03:55:30]  It's just like, you know.  It is.  It's a born-in thing.  We just don't talk about it.  It's scary.  I don't come in bitches.  No, white people don't do that.  We're smart, who kid?  We think three steps ahead.  It's chess, not checkers.  Opie doesn't come in girls.  When you look as good as me, why would you fucking come in a girl?  Yes.  You know they're going to keep it.  And that's what they want.  She wants to lock you in.  Opie lives in a world where he can just get away with saying, when you look like me, come  on. 
[03:56:00]  I knew it.  I knew it all those years.  The years you're sitting there being like, you're looking in the mirror going, how can  a guy as good looking as me come in a girl?  Are you kidding me?  My seat is more precious than Nagel's.  I'm handsome.  There's something wrong.  What a treat to wake up in the morning and look at that.  If the girl thinks she's going to have an ugly kid, of course she's not going to go  there.  Right.  Unless it's a love thing.  She's looking at you modeling that Coca-Cola t-shirt and like, fuck it.  Fuck, I could have a little fucking Coca-Cola kid.  I got to take this load.  Well, you know what it is. 
[03:56:30]  It's because you keep yourself looking so good.  You keep yourself looking trim.  You keep yourself looking, you know, smooth.  Keep going, man.  I like this.  So Sal doesn't come in girls?  Sal looks like he's coming girls.  Sal can't come with girls.  He can't keep an erection with girls.  We'll get to that.  We'll get to that on Monday.  Who can?  Because I was trying to talk about how smooth Opie keeps it.  He's not zombying at his face with old razors.  You know what I mean?  You know why?  Oh, God.  Hey.  Because he's always got new razors.  Opie's, it's not a problem. 
[03:57:00]  He knows.  You know how good I am?  I've been selling razors for the last few months.  I haven't shaved in six.  He knows.  How good am I?  I've sold a shitload of razors.  The fucking guy from the company said, holy fuck, you're doing an amazing job for my  company.  You don't need a vibrating handle.  You look like Jesus right now.  That's right.  No back scratcher.  No 10 blades.  By the way, Justin Stangle.  Yeah.  I would do that show in a second.  Genius and hilarious.  Wow.  I'm going to do this show.  Those are new text messages coming in.  My God.  Justin Stangle shaves too.  He looks great all the time.  Who get, how much do you pay for, how much do razors cost you a month? 
[03:57:30]  Uh, 12, $12.99, like a big.  Every month?  Yeah, because I got that bumpy skin.  Is that in pesos?  No.  You're doing a live read right now.  U.S.  That's my out.  I got to go.  I can't stick around for a live read.  Opie, this isn't a live read.  You know what this is?  What?  Your Dollar Shave Club moment.  Ooh.
