<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the George Zimmerman trial, featuring Jim Norton.  The hosts debated the nuances of the case, referencing the 911 call and the challenges of unbiased reporting amidst strong public opinion, fueled by online arguments and misinformation about Zimmerman’s pursuit of Trayvon Martin.  Club Soda Kenny’s technological struggles with his new phone provided comedic relief. The conversation expanded to neighborhood watch programs and armed citizens, drawing comparisons to the Guardian Angels.  Keith Robinson called in, vehemently criticizing Zimmerman and engaging in a heated debate with the hosts about racial profiling and the influence of clothing on perception.  Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler were mentioned as past guests.

The show then shifted to a detailed, graphic discussion of a Farrah Abraham pornographic video, including descriptions of specific sexual acts.  This transitioned into a movie review of "This Is the End," followed by a brief studio appearance from Ozzy Osbourne, with the hosts mimicking his speech.  Jimmy's unusual reaction to Osbourne’s arrival was discussed during a commercial break, which also featured a Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement.  Farrah Abraham then joined the show, discussing the non-consensual release of her sex tape, subsequent legal action, unusual offers she received, and her new show, *Finding Farrah*. She also recounted a negative experience with Dr. Phil. The hosts and Abraham discussed the video's production quality and the high price a bikini from the scene fetched on eBay before being removed.

Seth Rogen then appeared in studio, discussing his co-direction of *This Is the End* with James Franco, including celebrity cameos and the challenges of comedy filmmaking.  He shared anecdotes about working with Ozzy Osbourne (who approved the use of a Black Sabbath song) and Barbara Streisand.  Jimmy's adoption of a British accent while interacting with Osbourne was recounted humorously.  The conversation included discussions about the difficulties of making comedy sequels, citing examples like *Caddyshack 2*, *Sister Act 2*, and *Austin Powers*.  The hosts and guests frequently used vulgar and sexually explicit language throughout this segment.

The broadcast continued with Opie recounting his experience on a TBS show, detailing his win against Russell Peters and Paul Rodriguez, an awkward pre-show wait, a prank involving Obama and Osama Bin Laden (the Obama part cut), and a frightening post-show encounter with a disgruntled participant, Leonard, who had to be calmed down with money.  Seth Rogen’s studio appearance was praised extensively, highlighting his unexpected fandom of the show.  A significant portion focused on the show’s two new female interns, Sidney and Jackie, and the vastly different treatment they received compared to past male interns, including their effortless access to the studio and interactions with celebrities. Opie's party that Sidney and Jackie attended was discussed, along with speculation regarding the exclusion of a third intern. Davey Mac called in, complaining about his lack of support at SiriusXM despite his tenure, contrasting his experience with the interns' favorable treatment. He attempted a demo for E Street Radio.

The show featured a conversation with Eastside Dave and Sam Roberts.  A humorous Bruce Springsteen trivia contest highlighted Roland's knowledge. Opie discussed the exhaustion of fatherhood and his attempts to influence his children's musical tastes.  Dave discussed his career frustrations, using crude language and sexual innuendo to describe his perceived mistreatment by management, and his dissatisfaction with his show's content, considering a sports-focused format.  His "Lonely Virgil" internet project and its appropriation by Deadspin were discussed.  The hosts discussed the upcoming after-show, mentioning Sidney and Jackie’s presence.  The "After ONA Live" segment featured further discussion of Dave’s career, his YouTube videos, an upcoming movie-thon, Black Sabbath album promotion, and frank, vulgar commentary about Farrah Abraham's appearance.  Listener calls, more discussions about Dave's career, and a call with Mike Traynor to secure a possible appearance for Sam Roberts on TruTV occurred.  Opie's Seth Rogen-signed Sudoku puzzle was given away.  The episode ended with a discussion about interns Jackie and Sidney.  Throughout, frequent use of vulgar and offensive language, including misogynistic and homophobic slurs, was present.

An earlier segment featured a conversation with Dave (likely Eastside Dave), beginning with a discussion about low radio pay, leading to a humorous anecdote about selling vacuums.  This segued into a live read for Steven Singer Jewelers, featuring the memorable website address "IHateStevenSinger.com."  Dave then promoted his upcoming appearance at a movie festival and his impending appearance on TruTV, followed by a plug for the Opie and Anthony Facebook page, and a transition to the Ron and Fez show with Dave as a guest.

But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do it.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here.

I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

Let's get the show on the road! 
[00:01:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good morning, everyone!  Hi!  Hi, everyone around the globe.  Around the globe now, huh?  Yeah, listening around the globe.  Nice.  Nice.  In faraway lands.  Wink!  I'm tired.  A little sleepy today?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a kid up all night.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:02:00]  Fucking beat.  Yeah.  No rhyme or reason.  Nah.  Nah, everything goes well and then all of a sudden you get hit with whatever the fuck.  Fucking tired.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're tired.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we live our lives tired because these hours are ridiculous.  Yeah, it really is.  Great gig.  Great gig.  Fucking wonderful.  Stupid hours.  Wonderful gig, stupid hours.  Oh, my God. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Yesterday, a fine show.  I liked all of our guests, of course, Ozzy Osbourne and, uh, uh, uh, Geezer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, and then, uh, Robert Zimmerman, you know?  And then, uh, the whole rest of my day was spent arguing with people on Twitter.  I saw that.  About, about the Trayvon and George Zimmerman.  Well, you know, after you have, the thing is, after you have a, a show like that.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Where, you know, Robert Zimmerman's on, we're talking about the trial.  It just is non-stop.  Yeah.  Like, people are mad at you.  They're calling you names.  And then, you know, you try to defend yourself and your point.  You realize how, you know, uninformed some people are that want to get into a debate about things  and don't really know what they're talking about.  So, uh, and then you try.  Like, I put the phone down and I'm watching some TV.  It's kind of shitty out.  I wanted to kind of hang out outside, but it's raining.  Right.  Which is even worse, because then you're just sitting there. 
[00:03:30]  There's nothing really else to do, but.  And then you stare at the phone and go, ah, and you grab it again.  And then I'm trying, you know, I throw some other shit in.  Like, you know, Bobo was talking about getting his goddamn learner's permit.  So, I was trying to find some pictures of huge pileups on the highway.  So, I could just.  See, that's nice.  Tweet the picture, a little fun.  And then you read something.  It's like, now I got to address that.  And then before you know it, hours go by and you've been debating people at 140 characters a clip.  I don't know how you do it. 
[00:04:00]  Because, you know.  I don't either.  People make it perfectly clear they don't like you.  Yeah.  And, you know, sometimes you want to sit there and go, well, maybe I could turn this person around.  Explain a thing or two or give them some real facts.  Yeah.  And then you do that and you realize, oh, no, this person just doesn't like you and will never like you and is obsessed with you and has to fucking, you know, try to, like, turn the screws.  That's what it is.  And then you finally realize that it's so much, it's so freeing.  You know what it is, though?  To just let it go.  Because you just realize there are people out there that are just fucking jerks. 
[00:04:30]  But there's a whole other aspect to it when you're in a debate about a topic.  But that's like debating abortion.  Well, it...  You're never going to have someone tweet you back and go, oh, okay, I see it your way now.  I know.  But people ask me all the time, like, why are you even acknowledging this person who has five followers or something?  And I'm like, well, it gives me the opportunity to clear up, like, misinformation that's out there. 
[00:05:00]  Right, because what they're tweeting might be some misinformation that you just know that a lot of people have.  Right.  Yeah, I get that.  And a prime example was last night, talking about the George Zimmerman trial.  Well, and I think the biggest misconception and the biggest thing that people bring up is, oh, well, he was told not to follow.  And then there's various things.  By the police department, he was told to stand down.  He was told to stop the pursuit. 
[00:05:30]  He was told, you know, by an authority figure or something.  So all I was doing is like, please read this.  And then I tweet a link to the actual transcript of that 911 call.  And, you know, it's got the him talking, saying, yeah, there's a person.  I called the police on the phone with 911 saying, here it is.  And then they tell him, oh, well, let me know what he does.  Let me know what this guy does.  And he's like, okay. 
[00:06:00]  Now, that would lead me to believe they kind of want you to keep the guy within eyeshot if they're saying, let me know what this guy does.  And then at one point they ask him, are you following him?  And he said, yes.  And then the 911 operator says, all right, we don't need you to do that.  And then his next, the very next line says, George Zimmerman, okay.  Okay.  Then there's no other indication whatsoever that he followed. 
[00:06:30]  You actually hear the wind sound in the phone.  It actually stops where he stopped walking, stopped following.  But you can't tell people that.  They've heard it so many times that he's pursuing.  He chased him down.  He was stalking.  And the truth of the matter is, if you just read the actual transcript, they always leave out the part where he says, you know, well, we don't need you to do that.  And he goes, okay.  It's like, what the fuck?  Why did he leave that part out? 
[00:07:00]  And no matter how many times I retweeted that, in that link, so people could read it, within 10 minutes, well, you chased him down.  And then I feel compelled that I got to get it out there.  Keep fucking gapping about it.  Well, how many tweets did you have about it?  Maybe two or three, or?  A hundred?  It was a lot of fucking tweets.  Man, you have incredible passion for this one.  I, you know, I do get fucking, I do get involved. 
[00:07:30]  Entrenched.  Yes, enthralled.  You have dug in.  I have.  I can understand the whole phone thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But with me, it's Candy Crush.  Right, it's Candy Crush.  With me, it's Candy Crush.  With you, it's like, all right, I'm going to leave this alone.  I'm not going to argue with people on Twitter today, or for the next hour.  Right.  And then you're just staring at that phone, and you're like, fuck, I got to go back to arguing.  With me, it's Candy Crush.  And then I was arguing.  I might have to, I might have to fucking go somewhere for a few days. 
[00:08:00]  Do you think you need, like, rehab?  Dude, I can't fucking get past this level, 147.  Oh my God.  And this is so mundane and stupid, I understand.  Yeah.  But it's the same thing.  Oh my God, I don't even want to hear the sound.  The sound, you must hear that in your sleep.  Yeah, I didn't mean to do that.  You must hear that in your sleep.  And I can't get past this level.  And I'll go, all right, just put the phone, put the phone down.  Yeah.  One hour, and I'll look at the fucking clock.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to make the hour.  I think I might be a little addicted right now.  How do you get out of this?  You're stuck. 
[00:08:30]  See?  This is why I do not play video games.  Because over the years, people go, man, it talks about video games.  You know, what games do you play?  And every once in a while, I'll get hooked on one.  Like, mostly it's Tiger Woods Golf.  Yeah.  But those other ones, man, I'd be in deep fucking trouble.  Leveling up and things.  Yeah, because, you know, I know I got a little of the OCD in my own stupid brain.  We all do, matter of fact.  It's how you control it.  Yeah, yeah.  But with me, that's the trigger.  Fucking video games is the trigger for my OCD.  Especially that type where it's, you know, the leveling up. 
[00:09:00]  And you gotta, I gotta hit that next level.  And then it gets to a point where you're now in a trance.  With me, it's a trance.  There are days I'll go, all right, I'll just play a little and I can.  And I'm like, all right, bye.  Yeah.  But if I play long enough, something fucking goes off in my brain.  And now I'm in the trance stage.  Nothing else.  And it's just over and over and over and over again.  Yeah.  So.  So I can relate.  It's just like what you do. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's, uh.  But I think it's important because I think we all do it with whatever.  With that phone, man.  It's tough to fucking put that phone down sometimes.  But then, you know, like I, so last night a friend of mine comes over.  And he's, he was also a lawyer.  Right.  You know, he passed the bar.  He was a lawyer for a while.  And, um, and then we just sit there and discuss the fucking, the, the George Zimmerman case.  And, and go back and forth with like what's up there and speculating and stuff. 
[00:10:00]  So I'm like.  But you guys are both on the same side.  Oh.  Uh.  Wouldn't it be a better debate if the, if you had someone that was maybe for the other side?  No, he doesn't really have.  And had more intelligence?  He doesn't really have an interest either way in a side.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  And I'm not really, I'm not, I'm not trying to do it as I have a side.  I'm really just trying to do it as here's the deal.  It's like the Casey Anthony thing.  You know, I, I was fully involved in that one.  I, I, I like.  But we all know why. 
[00:10:30]  Well, you know.  Yeah.  No, I was fully involved, but the legality of it, you, you get caught up and, and you  want to really kind of figure out where it's going and what the jury will see and think  and, and you, you, you consider the, the evidence and not that peripheral emotion.  There's so many other layers on top of these, uh, high, uh, profile trials.  And most of it is stuff that won't even, or isn't supposed to be considered by a jury.  It's just not even supposed to be fucking considered. 
[00:11:00]  And, and this has a lot of that.  The, the real goal here is to have the, the jurors pay attention to what would probably  amount to less than 20 minutes of time.  Not what Trayvon was doing in school and growing up doing and saying, and not what, what George  Zimmerman, his past had, not what happened after with the police and no arrest having  been made and all that.  You got to focus that jury on 20 minutes of time in that night and every, every progression 
[00:11:30]  that their contact made throughout that, that time.  And it's very difficult when, when you have race involved and, and, um, people are very  passionate about it.  Right.  You know, so, uh.  So jury selection is going to take forever to find those special people.  It's like two weeks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that a long time?  Uh, yeah, I, I, I guess it is.  Uh.  The problem is the public, they've already made up their minds.  Yeah.  No matter what.  They've picked sides.  No matter what. 
[00:12:00]  They've picked their sides.  I, I think, I think when you get.  And a long racial lines in general, obviously.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's amazing.  It's so easy.  I read a Keith Robinson tweet last night, speaking of which.  Uh, yes.  What did he say?  He's something about, uh.  He's pro Trayvon Martin.  That's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What was his tweet?  Could you find Keith Robinson real fast?  Very interesting.  Yeah.  I started following him.  I didn't realize I didn't follow Keith on Twitter.  I, I, I was like, oh yeah, I gotta follow Keith.  And, uh.  The motive, the motives of support are.  What was his last tweet?  I was, well, he probably tweeted since I, I read it. 
[00:12:30]  Uh.  Take my, give me a swirl.  I need another swirl.  Yeah, go down a little bit.  Where was it?  Turn my bit.  God damn it, motherfucking reason.  I didn't see that.  I don't know if I follow him.  I'm gonna have to fucking.  Well, I would like to get his take on it.  Follow him, motherfucker.  Cause a lot of people were asking, uh, after, oh yeah, okay.  George Zimmerman.  The only thing worse than an asshole cop is an asshole who thinks he's a cop. 
[00:13:00]  Watching his dumb face on headline news.  Yeah.  There you go.  Full of facts and, uh, accurate depiction.  Yeah, I would love to get him on the phone and talk to him about it.  Keith is from, uh, apparently a very rough area in Philly.  It's not a surprise to me.  No, no, I, I, exactly.  But this is the type of one where we would spend, if I was like not getting up in the  morning, hours at this, this, 10 years ago would have been a three in the morning or  every night at the cellar.  Really? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, with Patrice and all.  Oh my God.  I would have had to fucking beg Nick DiPaolo to stay so I had somebody to argue with my  side.  Yeah, it's a, it's, this is the big, this is the big case that's going to be when it really  kicks up.  And then the casual viewer of the trial will start getting a little more educated as to  what is going on because they're watching it unfold.  So that's not my passion.  I love the cases like this. 
[00:14:00]  I like trying to figure it out.  Yeah.  Well, the, the one thing I noticed on Twitter after the show, um, the people that were pissed  off that we had, you know, um, Robert, Robert, Jesus, I almost said Roger, Robert Zimmerman  on the show is wondering if we're going to get someone from Trayvon Martin's, uh, family.  Well, I got that.  And we would in a second, by the way.  Yeah.  I got that too.  But I, I, what I tweeted was, uh, well with NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, I go, I think they  got it covered.  I, I think, you know, they're the network news and stuff. 
[00:14:30]  They're not, they're not presenting this, uh, in a fair, uh, but for our purposes, we  should certainly have someone like that on our show to bounce it out a little bit here  what they have to say.  But it's also hard to get, um, the family members of the person that died and give a  kind of, you don't want to feel like you're, you're beating up on them.  No, they've had enough.  They just did the family of a guy who got shot.  Right.  Right.  You know, regardless of this circumstance and how this trial ends, they are the family 
[00:15:00]  of somebody that got killed.  So, uh, it's kind of hard.  You don't want to feel like you're, you're beating up on them.  Like I'm going to sit there and be like, well, your son and I'm like, yeah, and they  don't want to fucking hear it.  I thought we would.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I would have them on a second, but I don't think they want, this is their, their forum  as their platform, as their little platform.  Yeah.  So that was, we should get Keith Robinson on the phone though.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Good luck.  Wannabe.  So wannabe cop.  What was that?  A fucking, I mean, if you had somebody in your neighborhood that was performing a neighborhood  watch kind of a thing and, and your neighborhood has been prone to break-ins and stuff, wouldn't  you kind of want that going on?  Wouldn't you kind of want to, would you drive around and go, ah, there's that wannabe cop?  But regardless, I mean, before any of this happened, would you be going like, oh, that  wannabe cop?  Or would you be leaving maybe to go somewhere?  You lock your door and you're like, well, I kind of feel good that this guy's going to be  guys driving around and it's easy to, it's easy to say that. 
[00:16:00]  But in my neighborhood, I, I, I, I don't know who I would trust in my neighborhood to be  watching over my shit.  That's the problem.  Well, I'm not saying George Zimmerman wasn't qualified.  I don't know.  And, and, and then, you know, who do you pick?  And then you trust him with a gun.  And I don't know.  I don't think anybody knew he had a gun.  I think it was, you know, he just happened to, they didn't issue him.  A pistol for the neighborhood watch. 
[00:16:30]  Because he's walking in the neighborhood, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Here you go.  Here you go.  All right.  We got to pick one asshole here.  You.  Here.  We picked you and here's your gun.  You got the gun this month.  Yeah.  Good point.  Yeah.  It's, uh.  I wonder, I, I bet there's a bunch of people that think that though.  Yeah.  That, you know, neighborhood watch and here, here's your, uh, you know, your gun.  Here's your gun.  What?  Oh, okay.  Should I shoot someone when they, you know, go through a yard?  Right.  I, uh, just lost my thought. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, God damn it.  I just lost my thought.  Jimmy.  About neighborhood watch.  Guy with the gun.  Oh, yeah.  I would love an FBI profiler.  Unfortunately, Vos is not available.  But I would love to ask a profiler.  A fucking blithering idiot.  He is available.  If, uh.  Wow, you did a Gary Busey right there.  Yes.  Fucking strong.  And the FBI.  Oh, his father.  Fucking blithering idiot.  Fucking strong. 
[00:17:30]  Today.  But I would be interested to hear, because I think he is a wannabe cop, and I'm not even  saying that.  I think anyone who does a neighborhood watch with a gun, to a certain degree, is, like  a lot of, uh, traffic cops, ticket writers, you know, it's a job a lot of people, saying  wannabe cop is a derogatory way of saying somebody who would love to be a cop and just  isn't of money.  Right, right.  To explain further, when you said that about neighborhood watch, and you were talking about  wouldn't you want a guy?  Yeah.  My thought, I should have said it originally, Guardian Angels. 
[00:18:00]  I never liked the Guardian Angels.  I always thought they were, like, a bunch of guys that were wannabe cops, that didn't want  to do the work to actually become a cop, and they kind of always looked very underqualified.  Although there is a bravery with those guys.  You know, sorry to Curtis Sleeve and the gang, but in general, that's what I always saw with  those guys.  Yeah.  Yes.  I'd love to get a profiler's take on this.  Like, a guy who does personality, would he say, well, I'm just curious, like, would  he say Zimmerman seems like an overzealous guy, or would he say that, I would love to  just get an expert who deals with, I'd say personality profile, you know what I mean? 
[00:18:30]  There weren't any complaints about what he was doing beforehand.  He had a lot of phone calls to the police throughout his tenure as Neighborhood Watch.  It was probably about a year, I guess.  And he had a lot of calls to the police, and, you know, I don't know.  In my neighborhood, I got a guy that drives around, and he's got a little yellow beacon 
[00:19:00]  on his car that, like, and he's kind of the Neighborhood Watch guy.  So who is he, though?  He's, like, hired by the neighborhood, and...  Do you pay a neighborhood fee type thing, or...?  Well, you can be involved in something, it's, like, there's a community pool and a fucking,  like, area of tennis courts.  You have a community pool in that area?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't know that.  And you can pay into it.  I don't.  Right.  You know, but if you do, you get, like, those perks and stuff like that. 
[00:19:30]  And one of them is the security guy.  I just happen to be on the block, so...  Yeah, he can't...  He doesn't just shut his eyes and shut his little beacon off and drive past my house  and turn it back on.  This guy ain't paying.  Right.  I'm like the guy that fucking doesn't...  I don't give the stripper the dollar, but the guys on either side of me do.  Right.  So she's still got to walk past me on the bar.  Imagine your front yard is just yelling and screaming, and he has to ignore it because you didn't pay.  You didn't pay your fee. 
[00:20:00]  A naked woman just yelling, help me!  Yeah.  Help!  Nope, he didn't pay.  Sorry.  Oh, God.  Nothing to see here.  Yeah.  So I got that over there, and...  That actually is kind of nice.  It is, because, you know...  Because I'm starting to think about maybe moving to the suburbs, get a little more room.  I would like something like that, knowing that someone's just kind of out there.  He's out there, you know...  Controlling a little bit.  When you're not home, you know that he's fucking tooling around, and he's probably some fucking dopey guy.  I mean, not qualified to take someone down or, you know... 
[00:20:30]  But just his presence is a deterrent.  Right.  You know, and I think if somebody knows that there's a neighborhood watch going on, and there's a guy driving around in his truck, it is a deterrent.  And if he's calling the cops, I don't think there's...  I think the fact that he was on the phone with 911 when shit was going on, it kind of shows that he wasn't looking for trouble.  It's like, if you're looking for trouble, you don't call the cops. 
[00:21:00]  You're the big hero.  I'll do the takedown.  I'll chase him and tackle him and cuff him, and then I'll call the cops.  But he's like...  And he can hear in his voice, he's like, oh, yeah, we got another one of these guys.  God, they're always getting away.  He's like, they're always getting away.  It's like, well, he was calling the cops.  Why did he follow them?  Well, you could hear him say, they always get away.  How many times has he called the cops?  The cops show up and go, all right, what do you look like?  All right, well, we'll file a report. 
[00:21:30]  And he's like, fuck, you know, there he is.  I'd like to know where he goes.  Now, how many times have they called the cops?  I'm not sure actual numbers.  I'm sure that'll come out.  I'm curious to how many times he's called the cops and how many arrests it led to.  Maybe none, but was he one of these guys?  Like they say, and again, he's not a...  But certain people inject, like serial killers, and again, of course, inject themselves into the investigation  because they want to have some sort of relationship with the cops.  That personality, again, he's not a serial killer. 
[00:22:00]  But like, is he the type that just wanted to be an officer and was just always trying to communicate?  Yeah, I don't think there's a history there of really this overzealous, over-the-top, crime-fighting guy.  I mean, anything I've heard, it's simple, driving around, and if he sees something he deemed suspicious, he'd call the cops.  He wasn't throwing himself in there and drawing his gun and saying, freeze.  You know, it seemed like what any neighborhood would want somebody to do if, you know, there's been break-ins in the neighborhood. 
[00:22:30]  Well, more importantly, how many hours are you going to spend on this today?  Oh, my God.  You know what, though? Today is supposed to be a nicer day, right?  Okay, good.  So, fucking poolside, which doesn't excuse me from Twitter because I will lay on that fucking chair,  and I'll be totally tan except for my neck, where I'm laying on the chair looking down like this,  so my neck is totally white and everything else gets tan. 
[00:23:00]  You get a red forehead?  Yes.  Speaking of phones, we've got to talk Club Soda Kenny off the ledge.  He is out of his mind, almost suicidal.  I heard it on the way up in the elevator.  If you know anything about Club Soda Kenny, our pal, who we love dearly, and he does a great job for us,  he hates change.  He hates fucking moving tracks.  He gets in a track.  Yes.  I call it a track.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of people that are stuck in a track where their whole lives are set.  They do the exact same routine every day, and there's no real way to move it around. 
[00:23:30]  And Kenny, when you fucking take him out of that track, he fucking loses his mind.  Especially when it's a guy like Kenny with tech.  Not that he's dumb, but you get used to a certain technology, and that's a rough one for any of us to do,  is adjust to a new phone.  And Kenny's not a big tech guy.  Oh, for real.  He's losing it.  He's losing his mind.  And it's the BlackBerry, which I gave up on, it has to be, I don't know, maybe three years ago now.  I used to love BlackBerry, but it was obvious to me that they were falling behind, and they just couldn't keep up, 
[00:24:00]  and it became a shittier product.  And he won't give his laptop, he doesn't do enough, he works on it, but he doesn't give it enough,  he doesn't learn it.  And it's like, as much as Kenny's a detail-oriented guy, and he's a smart dude,  but he doesn't learn this new technology, he gets the basics.  It's like, you gotta learn how to use it, and all these cool apps, and things you can do with it,  and it's gonna make your job easier, and your fucking life-y, but he doesn't do that.  It's made his job more miserable. 
[00:24:30]  He's like, I can't call Anthony anymore, he goes, it used to be one button while I was driving,  and now I can't even make a phone call.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got the buttons, and then the touch screen, which is the stupidest idea ever,  because, I mean, the touch screen part is,  it's so tiny, because they gotta fit the button.  Why am I explaining it?  Most of us have seen the fucking phone.  Yeah.  But, I mean, to have that little bit of space for the touch screen is ridiculous.  My car has a key to start it, and a crank on the front. 
[00:25:00]  It's like, that's exactly what the fuck is happening, you can do away with the buttons.  And I go, you should have just stuck with your old phone, and he goes, it was falling apart.  So now, I think he's gonna go online and try to find an old Blackberry.  Oh, no.  And just stick with that.  That will have problems.  But instead of just realizing, I hope he was a touch screen guy.  Ant was.  I wasn't a touch screen guy.  I mean, I was a button guy.  I mean buttons, yeah.  I hated that I had to move on from Blackberry.  I liked them that much back in the day.  I was very psyched.  It was so obvious it was time that they just fucking didn't get it. 
[00:25:30]  It's a terrible phone.  I was excited for the touch screen.  Very excited when they first came out.  I'm like, oh, this is it.  I wasn't excited at all.  I didn't like buttons when I found out that there was touch screen.  I was like, this is gonna be very cool.  Really?  Kenny, on the other hand, he was going off like, like I tried to call you.  Right.  And my old phone, one button.  You push one button, and there you were.  Now, I don't know how to work that.  Now he can't just hit the speed dial one button.  Well, that's what you get for going with that fucking hybrid awful phone.  That's what you get. 
[00:26:00]  How about just learn this touch screen.  Horrible hybrid malarophone.  It'll be a mongrel phone.  Mongrel phone.  Get the Samsung.  I love my iPhone.  But it's Samsung.  I got lazy.  I got lazy.  I want to go to the 4.  I just haven't yet.  But I still love my S3.  Kenny's got big clunky fingers.  That's a good phone for him.  I mean, yours is probably even better than an iPhone because it's fucking big.  I don't even feel like it's a big phone.  I've been looking at.  Your screen is definitely bigger.  I've been looking at people with the Note, and I almost, I might go Note. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  It still fits in your back pocket.  No way.  For the people that don't know, the Note is a bit wider.  Wider?  It's wider, yes.  Wow.  Oh, man.  So we got to get Kenny in here because it'll be good radio because he's really losing it.  He's fucking going crazy.  I feel bad for him because it's not his thing.  He's been calling me, uh...  And then he tells me the instruction booklet.  I guess the phone companies have decided not to give you the booklet anymore. 
[00:27:00]  It's online.  Everything has decided not to give you a booklet anymore.  Oh, everything?  You don't get instructions anymore.  You got to, here's the website.  Go there.  Download the fucking...  Because I had to print out 75 pages.  And they...  He prints it out?  Yes, he does.  Why would you print out the manual?  Because that's Kenny.  That's what I'm trying to say.  You just look at it online.  That's his thing.  He's old school.  He has...  Kenny has to hold and touch things.  Yes, yes.  He needs that tactile...  Yeah.  He needs that experience of the buttons.  The buttons, the billy club in hand.  Yeah, he has the perp. 
[00:27:30]  The sap.  Which is also him.  What was the phone he had before that?  Because do you remember it took him forever to even go to the BlackBerry?  A bell.  Because we're like...  I'm like, Kenny, what are you doing?  It was some kind of flip phone.  I'm like, Kenny, there's great phones out there.  And he finally said, all right, and got the BlackBerry.  And he hated the original BlackBerry for a while.  Kenny's thing is the phone.  He talks on the phone.  Then he wipes the face grease off it.  Then he puts it back in that awful sheath.  Oh, right.  Remember?  You watch Kenny when he wipes his face grease.  I forgot about that. 
[00:28:00]  Because I'll do that once a week.  Kenny does every time he talks.  He'll pull the phone out and wipe the face grease off it.  Make the call or whatever.  Oh, my God.  And then put it back in that horrible BlackBerry sheath.  It's sheath?  The BlackBerry, dude, it makes me angry how bad it is.  And I was a BlackBerry guy, too.  I loved it.  But I hated AT&T and wanted to go to fucking Verizon, and BlackBerry had it.  It makes me literally want to physically burn down the plant.  They make me...  They're so terrible.  And people are so passionate about their phones.  I mean, I get hate tweets about trashing BlackBerry.  I'm like, do you understand? 
[00:28:30]  I had probably four or five different BlackBerrys.  I was all in.  Yeah.  They lost me.  I didn't want to change phones.  They suck.  I did not want to change.  I'm glad I did now, but...  I don't know, but you talk about someone's phone, man.  They get very, very upset.  When you realize how much time you spend on the phone, your phone with you, you're using  your phone for everything from an alarm clock to a fucking library, people get very personally 
[00:29:00]  attached.  Very personally attached.  And they don't want to hear, like, that their shit sucks.  No way.  It really is weird when we make personal.  That is exactly your bit.  They're bowling outside.  Fox News is bowling outside right now.  Right outside this building, across the street.  Whoa, hey.  She's bowling with high heels.  I've got her ball.  Do we have another opportunity to come out and bowl today?  Is that how Laurie goes?  By the way, if you would like to have your kids bowl free this summer, go to bowlfree...  kidsbowlfree.com.  I'll go down there.  I'll fucking wail it. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Click on your town and find the center.  Yeah, we're blowing your little hands up the crumbs off.  From the United States and all provinces of Canada.  At least one center.  Feel the little soft, warm bowling pin.  Yeah, let me show you how to put your finger in a little hole.  Use my mouth like the bowling ball.  All these news shows have become morning zoos.  What are they doing?  If you really boiled it down and timed how much time they spend on actual news, not even 
[00:30:00]  the dumb fluff pieces, actual news per hour on these morning news shows, it would probably  amount to maybe five minutes, I would give them.  Five minutes.  They're way goofier than we are.  And they're Fox News.  So much more goofy.  They're way goofier.  Way.  We go goof, but...  Of course we do.  And we still like to talk about...  Look at the camera.  Thanks, Ted.  Did Ted make this?  Yeah, I think that's Ted.  Oh, they got their pictures on some of the bowling pins.  They're still running in the rain. 
[00:30:30]  He got a...  Today's with...  A little journey.  Let's do journey day.  We've done that before, I think.  But Kenny was terrific on Inside Amy last night.  That was very funny, man.  I didn't see it.  I heard he was great.  He was great.  Amy Schumer.  Inside Amy is a great show, obviously, on Comedy Central.  She does an interview piece.  Yeah.  And this week was Kenny.  Kenny, she just talked to him about what he does and his job and being a cop. 
[00:31:00]  It is funny.  It's not online.  It's not online?  It's fucking...  It was really funny.  They had a great rapport with each other.  Right.  Like, I think Kenny was being charming.  Yes.  As charming as a fucking backhoe can be.  And Amy was very funny.  I think she was a little taken with him.  She loves it.  Yeah.  He was a bit smitten.  Yeah.  Well, they had spent time when you guys run around on the road and stuff.  So, yeah.  Almost felt this weird, dare I say, sexual energy.  Really?  I saw more of a father-daughter sexual energy. 
[00:31:30]  Did you?  I don't know.  I saw a little, like...  Just a little.  It was funny, man.  Nothing that either side would act on, but there was some kind of...  There was certainly chemistry.  Yeah, yeah.  I tell you, every woman that's open for me, and especially...  I'm sure the guy, too, is...  Yes.  Is now dead by eights.  Oh, sorry.  And every...  Especially every girl I've dated, they all miss Kenny, because he's really nice to these  people.  And I think these women feel safe with him. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, of course.  Especially the comics on the road, they feel kind of protected by him.  Yeah.  But, you know, if you're in...  If you're on Kenny's good side, he's the greatest.  I mean, if you're not, he seems really cold and like a motherfucker.  And if you are...  Yeah.  You still think he's cold and a motherfucker, but you realize he's not going to hurt you.  Yeah, he's not going to squish you like a bug.  But it's hard for him to warm up to people, but once he does, you realize he's a great  guy.  Yeah, yeah.  That was...  It was funny.  He spoke with her.  I guess the actual interview was like 20 minutes long, and they cut it down. 
[00:32:30]  Sure.  So...  But he's talking about his being a cop, and Amy was...  The way she was laughing at him was very genuine.  Yeah.  It was very cool.  That was a star-studded Inside Amy Schumer last night.  Jimmy and Bobby Kelly.  Your bit was hilarious.  Florentine.  Bobby's creepy, man.  Yeah, yeah.  There's not much acting going on there.  I know Bobby's a good actor.  Bobby's had a lot of TV lately, but he...  Oof.  Yeah, this is creepy.  It was easy for him to go to that place. 
[00:33:00]  And, oh, yeah, there's Florentine.  And Joe and Jim are on.  I didn't see that.  Yeah, yeah.  Joe DeRosa was on.  He was playing like a cop behind the two-way glass with an interview going on inside.  And Kurt Metzger, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Kurt Metzger.  Hilarious.  It was fucking...  There were a lot of people.  Star-studded.  Yeah, it's like every scene.  It's like, oh, I know that guy.  Got Keith Robinson on the line.  Oh, wow.  Yo, Keith.  What's up, man?  Hey, buddy. 
[00:33:30]  Did we wake you up?  No, you know what?  I was watching Weird Science.  That is a good one to pop on early in the morning.  Weird Science.  Nice.  Well, I read your tweet about George Zimmerman last night.  Yeah, he bugs me.  That guy bugs me.  He bugs me.  I understand.  And we had his brother on our show yesterday.  Oh.  Yeah.  Kind of going over, you know. 
[00:34:00]  And it's very passionate about this case.  Extremely passionate.  And he sees it George Zimmerman's way.  Well, I'm kind of...  To be fair.  I've been looking at really pawing through the evidence that's going to be presented in court.  And, you know, what's out there already.  I'm sure there's other stuff that we haven't seen yet.  But I was just...  But why does he bug you?  I love your tweet.  Why does he bug me?  First of all, no...  Here's the first thing.  Yeah.  No man would even admit that's a real man.  That I was the guy screaming in that tape. 
[00:34:30]  That man...  It was me that was screaming.  It was me.  Who does that?  Who does that?  The man goes, I was the guy that was screaming.  It wasn't a 17-year-old.  It was me.  That's some bugs I'm like.  He's bitch-made.  I can't stand him.  He's a bitch-made dude.  I hope his brother's listening.  Your brother is a bitch.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:35:00]  I love it.  We kind of needed you yesterday, Keith.  It was very one-sided yesterday.  Why could I be that?  That's to show you who he is.  His fat, stupid face bugs me.  Now, taking away the he's a bitch and his face bugs you and his screaming.  Like, purely based on evidence-wise, do you think he's going to be acquitted or convicted? 
[00:35:30]  Be, I think, evidence-wise?  Well, yes.  I do think he probably will be acquitted because people don't look at things how they're supposed to look at it.  This guy had no business following this kid.  Now, he really didn't follow him, if you look at the evidence in the 911 call.  When the 911 operator said, are you following him?  He said, yes.  The operator then said, we don't need you to do that.  And he said, okay. 
[00:36:00]  And there was no more following.  Well, I see.  Here you go.  Do you believe that?  Yeah, but you know why?  Because every bit of evidence supports that.  Where he was at the time, he was still on the phone with the 911 operator.  There wasn't any sign during the rest of that phone call that he was in pursuit of anybody.  But here you go.  Think about it.  How did he get attacked?  And why did he get attacked?  Well, that's just it.  He had to do something to get attacked. 
[00:36:30]  Well, it looks to me that Trayvon did not like that this motherfucker was eyeballing him.  And you could hear it.  He couldn't see.  See, you've got to know.  Now I've got to take you to a journey of a black guy walking from a white guy.  Let's go through this journey.  All right, Hispanic guy.  Come on.  Calm down.  White Hispanic.  White Hispanic.  I'm going to take you guys like I'm going to profile this whole case.  Okay.  All right.  I'm walking to a neighborhood, right? 
[00:37:00]  I'm going to a neighborhood.  And I just eyeball.  How am I going to eyeball a guy that I don't even, if he's not following me?  I'm looking.  Now I'm nervous.  I'm like, what the hell is this guy doing?  First of all, I've got to recognize that he's following me.  That's the first thing.  I've got to go, wait a minute.  Is this guy following me?  And I'm walking.  I think this son of a bitch is following me.  I was walking through Washington Square Park.  And I'm on the phone.  This is a true story.  And the guy, I said, I told the girl on the phone, I said, look, this guy said, she's following me. 
[00:37:30]  And he was walking, just walking right by.  So I took my belt off.  I had a belt.  Wrapped it around my hand.  I turned it to the guy.  This guy stumbled all the way through the park.  He was following me.  So in order for me to even think about attacking you, I've got to understand what you're doing.  But he was watching to see if he was up to any shenanigans. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, you know what?  Come on, guys.  You're not that naive.  He was just watching.  He could watch from his house.  Nah, you drive around.  The neighborhood had break-ins before.  And if you want to do some profiling, perhaps he was profiling who's been breaking into the fucking houses.  Well, you do some profiling by call the police.  That's their job.  He did.  He absolutely did call the police. 
[00:38:30]  He was on the phone with the cops, with the 911 operator.  If he's that guy that you think he is, how did he get his ass off?  If he just followed him in his car, would the guy open his car door and go, come on out of the car?  I'm about to whoop your ass.  Well, here's the deal.  When he was talking to the 911 operator and she said, we don't need you to do that.  He said, okay.  Hey, he was walking back to his vehicle, and that's when Trayvon ran at him and punched him in the face and started beating his face.  Is this the white guy in the suburbs version of him? 
[00:39:00]  Beating his face.  Well, let me tell you something.  The white guy's suburb version is the one that's going to be presented in court.  I'll be honest.  That's the one part of it that I've had a big problem with was how if Zimmerman was outside, I could almost believe he turned around and went back to the car.  My big problem has been how did Trayvon Martin get to him without him seeing it coming?  If he lost him and he couldn't find him, like, hey, where is this guy?  And was going back to his car, how did Trayvon run up on him from however many feet away? 
[00:39:30]  That's always been the problem I had with it is that part right there.  Well, you'd have to look at the layout of where they were.  He lost track of where Trayvon was.  He didn't have an eye on him the whole time because he stopped following him when the 911 operator  said stop.  I can't believe that.  Listen to me.  Have you ever been followed?  Take it from an expert in being followed.  In Chinese stores, wherever I've been, I've been followed. 
[00:40:00]  So I understand the whole sequence of what goes on when you're being followed.  When you're being followed, this kid had to be nervous.  He's by himself.  He don't know this, do you?  He's nervous.  And judging by George Zimmerman, Zimmerman, Zimmerman, whatever his name is, character,  he's the kind of guy that had to say something to provoke this kid.  So it doesn't make any sense that this teenage kid walking at night by himself is that dude. 
[00:40:30]  That he would just attack him for no reason.  You know, as far as what's being presented, see, that's why I say what's being presented,  the evidence, the statements, the witnesses, the 911 call, that's what I'm talking about.  Not, hmm, that guy seems like the kind of guy that would do this.  They don't want to fucking hear that in court.  No, no, no, but I'm just trying to tell you realistically.  Absolutely.  I hear what you're saying. 
[00:41:00]  You could speculate a lot as to what might have happened, a lot of hypotheticals.  But unfortunately for the Martin family, Trayvon isn't going to get to stand up and tell his side of what happened.  Forensic evidence of his body, where it is, what's on it, his knuckles, Zimmerman's face,  the proximity of the gun when the gun went off.  All that tells a story, too.  But what is being presented in court is George Zimmerman's statement to the police, 
[00:41:30]  the police's investigation on scene right after it happened, witness testimony.  Oh, you need no police that let him go at first?  Well, that's just it.  The cops aren't just going to pat him on the back and let him go.  There was no evidence on the scene at that night that led the cops to believe anything more than this was a self-defense shooting.  Listen, all the things that Zimmerman had to say, there was a black guy walking through.  Good enough for us.  Come on. 
[00:42:00]  This isn't fucking Selma.  Let's get real here for a second.  It's 2013.  The president's black.  The president's black for the love of Christ.  All right, Dad.  Can you take that out?  Hey, don't.  That's your thing.  That's your new cause.  That's my new fucking cause.  I'm fucking, I'm running with it, Keith.  That's my fucking cause.  I'm running.  I'm running.  You're going to play the president's black card. 
[00:42:30]  I'm playing the president's black card.  The president's black.  He's a white black, though.  If you want to call Zimmerman a white Hispanic, the president's a white black.  He's a white black.  He's a white black.  Hey, who was following you?  Black still equals one thing.  A black.  Right.  Who was following you in the park that night?  Do you know or know what happened?  I don't know who it was.  They were just walking right and just kept walking and walking.  I just tried to get right into this guy.  And he was shocked.  And I could, you know, that's what you do at first. 
[00:43:00]  When somebody's following you, you first think, is he following me?  Because you're not sure about it.  If I feel like someone's following me, I'll step off to the side a little bit, turn so  I got an eye on him, and watch them pass me by.  I'll fucking, you know, I'll wait and wait until these motherfuckers get past me.  Right.  But when I was doing that, I was doing that.  And every time I would stop a little bit, they would stop.  You've got your peripheral, too.  And every time I, but then I just got tired of the following, and I just stopped walking 
[00:43:30]  right into him, and he just stumbled into the whole thing.  It's just like this.  You've got to realize this.  It's like Zimmerman shows you all the traits of a guy who's overstepping his authority.  And it's like, if you're walking, this is, remember now, this is a 17-year-old kid.  So people don't look at that because he's six foot, whatever. 
[00:44:00]  He's tall, and then he's six foot, he's a gangster.  That's what they're putting out.  How did he, 17 years old?  My son at that time was 17.  He's not a gangster.  He can fight, but he's not a gangster.  Yeah, yeah, well.  They all try to be.  Right.  But he's not.  He's a kid.  And that's what I think people are missing more than anything.  He's still a kid.  Well, there's some kids that you could pop up on various crimes that are pretty fucking  ruthless, to be honest with you. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  A 17-year-old kid shot a fucking baby in the face in a stroller.  That was, you know, oh, the poor kid, you know.  I do get that.  But that's the images that you can have in your head and go smash it over with this guy.  But Zimmerman is the guy at fault.  And if it was my son, there wouldn't be no trial.  There wouldn't be no, did you, did this, who did what?  I would see Zimmerman.  Well, obviously, there'd be a personal vested interest. 
[00:45:00]  No damn evidence.  My evidence is my foot in Zimmerman's ass.  Well, there would be a personal interest that you would have in that.  And, of course, you know, anybody that would lose a child would want to fucking put their  foot in his ass.  I hear you.  But let me say, I don't know who has kids there, but if you have kids, nobody's taking  that.  I have a kid.  This guy had no business following this guy.  He had no business following this guy.  You can't say no business.  If he's doing the neighborhood watch, and there's been break-ins, and he sees somebody 
[00:45:30]  that does fit the fucking profile of people that have been breaking into houses, he does.  A black guy with a hoodie?  Yes!  Yes!  I'm sorry, but that's who's fucking breaking in.  If you want to, then put on a fucking goddamn Farrakhan bow tie and suit and walk through  the neighborhood like that, and no one will fuck with you.  If you want to fucking walk through and look exactly like the people that break into the  houses, you're going to get fucking looked at.  You're going to get fucking looked at. 
[00:46:00]  Do you believe there's a certain way you have to dress?  Yes!  Sorry!  The white folks don't chase you.  And don't blame the white folks.  Why don't you paint his face white face and just walk through?  Well, that might have helped, too.  Blame every still from every closed-circuit television in every convenience store that's  been robbed.  Blame that, then.  Because every time, it's a black guy with a hoodie pulled up over his face.  They're robbing someone.  It's the fucking uniform. 
[00:46:30]  The white guys.  It's the...  No, a lot of black guys in hoodies are robbing people.  A lot of black guys in hoodies are doing the robbing.  It's just...  When you take that stance on it, that's what makes it bad.  No, it's what makes it...  Why can't people be honest and say, if you're dressed like a fucking thug in a neighborhood  where people are robbing houses...  Hoods made hoodies, you think?  Hoods made funny?  Hoodies made hoodies? 
[00:47:00]  Hood guys don't make hoodies.  Hoodies are just hoodies.  Hoodies are hoodies, but...  But here's every...  If you turn on the police scanner for Chicago on any weekend, you will hear black male wearing  a hoodie a thousand fucking times.  A thousand times in one night.  If you turn on a police scanner anywhere, you'll just hear a black guy walking.  I know.  That's not true.  I just walk into McDonald's.  That's nothing new.  I've listened.  I've listened.  You can chase down black guys randomly because that's what you hear. 
[00:47:30]  No, it's not just black guy walking.  It's shots fired, suspect running.  He's described as a black male wearing dark clothing, a black hoodie.  It's...  This is what...  You know how many times I've been stopped because of that?  Yeah, well, stop fucking...  You know what?  Stop what?  Blame...  No, blame the people that are ruining that fucking look for you then.  If you want to...  If I want to walk around a neighborhood where there's been a lot of bank robberies and my 
[00:48:00]  fashion statement is to wear a stocking over my face, I might get stopped.  Nobody's wearing a stocking over their face.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I'm trying to just make a point.  I understand.  But if I'm walking around wearing what amounts to be the uniform of a fucking armed robber,  I'm going to get stopped.  I got to jump in.  It's also the...  I'll say this about a hoodie, though.  Yeah.  Every high school jock wears a hoodie.  But that's one of those things where there's a lot of people that wear them that are doing... 
[00:48:30]  But that's also the uniform of every teenager doing anything.  I understand that the guys committing crimes wear them and they're in police descriptions.  I understand.  But it's not a piece of clothing that is specific to fucking up.  Like, more people wearing hoodies are doing nothing wrong.  A lot more than are doing something wrong.  I'm not saying everyone that's wearing a hoodie is a suspect.  But I'm saying a lot of suspects are wearing hoodies.  No, but it's a backwards...  How much do you do with a hoodie?  It's a backwards thing. 
[00:49:00]  I said that.  It's not that everybody wearing hoodies is a suspect.  But a lot of suspects in robberies and break-ins wear hoodies.  That's like saying blue jeans.  Like, if a guy's walking through a neighborhood with jeans on.  Like, his hoodies and jeans are...  It's such a nondescript piece of clothing.  It is.  It's just something you wear when you're cold and you keep your hood up.  It's cold.  It's going to be raining.  I understand.  Look, I'm not saying this is something that's great.  And I'm just being honest here.  This is a look that is now suspect. 
[00:49:30]  Honestly, God, I'll put it in the other thing when a D.C. sniper was doing it.  What they was looking for was white guys.  Yeah.  Because that fits the profile.  They were riding around all the time with guns out of things.  They would let them go right past.  Right.  Because the profile is supposed to be a white guy that does that.  And the majority of the times...  I'm not saying profiling is 100%, but there is an element to profiling.  Everyone wants to...  You know, even Jimmy was talking. 
[00:50:00]  Wants to profile George Zimmerman.  Let's see what kind of guy he was.  Was he overzealous as far as that?  Profile, profile, profile.  Until it goes the other way, where it's like, let's profile this guy and see what he was all about.  There is a...  On this case, though, in this case, George Zimmerman stepped out of pocket.  Don't...  Do not...  Your neighborhood watch don't make you a sheriff.  Don't...  Don't...  Does not give you the right to become a cop.  He may have stepped out of pocket, like you said.  He may have stepped out of pocket. 
[00:50:30]  But what did he do?  What did he do?  What do you mean, may have?  Well, may have.  But what did he do to merit getting his head beaten against the sidewalk and getting his face punched in?  He...  There you go.  Following somebody that he shouldn't have been following.  You can't assault someone for following you.  You can't.  See, but if you believe that this guy just was following him and doing nothing, then you're crazy.  There's no other physical...  But there's no physical evidence that shows that George Zimmerman initiated any physical assault. 
[00:51:00]  If you're being...  Like, okay, just like I said, this guy was following me, right?  Yeah.  And there could be no physical evidence.  It's just me understanding life.  Understanding life.  If I sit there...  You know what they do at the casino in Philly?  What they do in the casino in Philly?  You win money, they get in that car, they follow you home, rob you, of your winning.  Yeah? 
[00:51:30]  They rob you of your winning.  Now, if I'm that stupid to not go, no, when I'm in danger, I look always behind me.  I always look behind me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They follow so many people, and they wait to maybe get some gas.  They beat the pants off of them, and they take their...  You don't know, when you see somebody walking behind you, you can feel it.  It's just something that you go, wait a minute.  All right.  Ah, boy.  Zimmerman don't know if he's going to be robbed.  Oh, what's going on?  He probably confronted him. 
[00:52:00]  I guarantee he confronts what's going on.  Yeah, well, you don't.  And Zimmerman, being a bitch-made dude that he is, got his ass walked.  Good.  That's what my son would know, to protect yourself at all times.  You've got to protect yourself.  Well, again, that could be, but...  That could be.  But...  One thing we know, one thing we do know for a fact, Zimmerman followed this kid. 
[00:52:30]  At one point.  Yeah, yeah, but we don't know to what extent.  That's just it.  Yeah.  We don't know to what extent.  If you're real with yourself and understand how things...  We do know to what extent.  This guy just didn't turn around and just run after a guy that's not doing anything.  He might have not liked the way Zimmerman was eyeing him up.  And he might have felt threatened and overstepped his bounds by lunging out and just punching 
[00:53:00]  Zimmerman in the face because he did have kind of a penchant for fighting.  He was in trouble.  In school for fighting.  He got in trouble.  He got suspended for having an altercation with a bus driver.  Fighting.  This kid liked fighting.  It might have been.  You know, I think it might have been something like that where he saw Zimmerman following  him and then maybe he got annoyed.  And like, you know how you turned around in the park.  He may have turned around and went, this fat fuck is...  What do you want?  And then just belted him because he was annoyed.  I mean, that's...  He just got fatter. 
[00:53:30]  Zimmerman got fatter all of a sudden.  Like they take mercy on fat guys.  You think it's a defensive...  You think it's a defensive ploy that he's...  Just a fun-loving roly-poly guy that's just, all right, get out of here, you.  Well, I don't think we're going to change each other's minds, but...  No, I'm going to take you through a journey and you're going to walk around and we're  going to get followed and you're going to see how that feels. 
[00:54:00]  I know how that feels.  I've been followed.  I don't think you've ever been followed.  No, no, I absolutely fucking...  No, I have absolutely been followed and it's very uncomfortable.  It's a very uncomfortable fucking feeling.  But I try to get myself out of it immediately.  I turn around.  I step aside.  I look...  I'm always aware of my surroundings and who's coming up on me and stuff.  So I do walk.  I let them pass by.  If I see an inkling that somebody was following me and it wasn't just my paranoia, I try everything 
[00:54:30]  I can do to get myself out of that situation.  So Trayvon should have ran away.  Trayvon should have run to his fucking dad's house where, you know, he would have watched  the rest of the game and eaten his fucking Skittles.  Keith, should Trayvon have run away?  Should he have run away?  It's like this, though.  It's like I almost got robbed outside of a check cashing place.  It takes me to another journey.  Now, they were looking at me.  They had me dead to write.  So I had my envelope, my thumb envelope with the money in my hand.  Oh, no. 
[00:55:00]  These guys whispering, I look.  Guess what?  I went right in the midst of them.  What's going on?  Oh, yeah, you're fucking diffused.  Yes, you know what I mean?  So there's a lot of different techniques.  You're not that common.  You're also the guy that when the hooker you called wasn't the one you called, and she  said, give me the money, I'm going to get my boyfriend.  You said, go get him.  That's a great story. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, shit.  It is what it is.  Keith, don't play, man.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't play.  You go through that story.  Anybody will tell you.  That's anybody.  Because there's guys that will rob you on the street.  They start to follow you first to see where you are.  Of course.  Feel you out.  Are you going to give them trouble?  Right, and they're going to see how much trouble you're going to be, whatever it is. 
[00:56:00]  So I understand this young fella walking through the street who hasn't had that much experience  like that.  No matter how, every kid had a couple of fights in high school.  So, you know, and it's like, how much trouble?  What's going on?  This guy was running through his mind.  Why is this guy following it?  That's an intense moment.  Exactly.  I'm learning a lot here today.  I've got to jump in for a second, Keith.  In the black culture, like, why wouldn't you guys just run away? 
[00:56:30]  Like, I know enough white people where if we're in a situation, hold on, if we're in a situation  like that, I know nine out of ten times we're running the fuck away.  No, but that's not, that's not everybody.  Everybody's not built like that.  But it seems like in the black culture, more, more guys would stand their ground for whatever  reason.  Like, I don't understand.  Well, what about that then?  How about the stand-your-ground law?  And he beat the shit out of Zimmerman. 
[00:57:00]  And I would love it.  I don't think stand-ground applies to people following you.  There just seems to be less fear in those situations.  I just know.  Well, I see what you did.  I brought you to that.  You said, why wouldn't you just run away?  Yeah.  Why would you stand your ground?  But then when it works for that, you go, no, it's not stand your ground in that situation.  Well, it isn't.  But it isn't.  You can't, there's no following someone, regardless if he was following him or not, taking this  case out of it completely, following someone in and of itself is not a crime. 
[00:57:30]  It's not even a situation where you are then entitled to physically assault someone that  is following you.  Look at the paparazzi with celebrities.  They can't just, and if that isn't fucking a definition of stalking, but they cannot turn  around and punch the fucking photographer that is literally on their ass the entire time  they're walking, you can't punch them.  So again, if Zimmerman, even if he was following him and overstepping his bounds and whatever,  it does not give anyone the right to then punch him in the face. 
[00:58:00]  Okay.  Zimmerman wasn't just following him.  Well, now again, you're speculating.  No, I'm saying he had a gun on him, right?  He did.  He did.  Okay.  So what do you think a guy with a gun's intent is?  Well, a guy, I don't think you understand until you have a legal gun.  It's his intent.  Are you suggesting Keith has an illegal gun, sir?  Do you honestly think his intent is to rough up?  Are you suggesting that here today, sir?  Well, I'm suggesting that perhaps. 
[00:58:30]  No, no.  No, but I'm saying, Zimmerman, no, just go with me through this.  Zimmerman's in his house.  He sees a black guy in a hoodie, he tools up, as they say in a thing that we love, Jim, on HBO.  He tools himself up.  Tools himself up?  What's that?  Tools up.  He tools up?  Yeah.  What's the HBO series that we love?  The Wire. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, The Wire.  Yeah, yeah.  He tools himself up.  Uh-huh.  You tool yourself up for a reason.  Just go through the mindset of a guy that would do that.  Put his gun on and go outside and then follow somebody.  What do you think his intent is?  He was, but, no, he wasn't in his house.  He was driving around because he was a neighborhood watch guy.  He's there to watch and see if there's any fucking people that are trying to break into other people's apartments.  That's what his job was that night. 
[00:59:30]  His job description is to follow a guy with his gun that he thinks is suspicious.  That's his job.  Well, to call the cops, which he did.  He's done it.  Right.  Call the cops and sit still and sit where you are and then go from there.  No, call the cops and keep an eye on them so when the cops do show up.  How did he get his ass walked if he's driving around?  Well, he got out of his car.  He was keeping an eye on him while he was on the phone. 
[01:00:00]  Come on.  This is what's going to be presented in court.  Keith, but this is what's going to be presented in court.  And it's backed up by the 911 call where he's on the phone with the 911 operator while he's fucking looking and following him at that point.  The 911 operator says, we don't need you to do that.  And, by the way, that was for his safety.  Not for the unknown suspect at the time.  The unknown subject.  That one's a suspect.  But Trayvon at that point was an unknown subject. 
[01:00:30]  And the 911 operator didn't tell him, we don't need you to do that to protect the unknown subject.  It's, look, we don't need you to be following someone and get your fucking ass handed to you.  So wait for the cops.  He says, okay, stops following him.  And then the next thing we know, his head's being bashed and he's being punched.  We don't know exactly what transpired there because there's no witnesses and there's George Zimmerman's statement.  I want you to take your white logic out of it.  And I'm going to both remove our black and white logic. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  And we can just go to real logic.  If he's in his car, right?  How the hell are you going to get your head back against anything in your car?  Well, he wasn't in the car at that point.  He got out of his car.  For what?  To see where Trayvon was going.  So when the cops got there, he could go.  He went that away.  What did I just say?  Didn't I just say take that white logic out of it?  But that's the fucking, that's what happened. 
[01:01:30]  That's the testimony.  No, you gave him a reason why he did it.  He got out of his car to be the jackass that he is.  And he had that gun confidence.  That's why he got out of the car.  Because he had gun confidence.  That I agree with.  I think, again, not that I don't think that George Sherman set out to shoot him.  But I do think he got out because we talked about this.  I don't think you get on the phone with the police when you expect to go and roust someone with a gun.  I'm not saying he's going to roust him, but he did have confidence because of the weapon.  I do believe that. 
[01:02:00]  Okay.  All right.  I'll give you that.  Well, you know what?  That isn't going to be in court that he had to say something or he said something.  I understand.  I understand that there's a lot right now.  There's a lot.  You're on an O&A show.  I understand, but that's what I'm trying to present this in a very unemotional way. 
[01:02:30]  What I've noticed from a lot of black guys and black chicks that tweet about this case and want to discuss it is that it is pure racial emotion coming through on both sides with very limited factual information.  I'm just trying to stick to what is going to be heard and how a jury is going to look at what they're presented, not what might have happened, not what he was like or what he was thinking, why he was out of the beat. 
[01:03:00]  All that stuff is going to come into play, but you've got to take that emotion out of it.  I just told you, I removed my black emotion.  You're incapable.  You're incapable of removing your black emotion.  You may have a point.  We've got to hang out and have a swirl or two, Keith.  I'm going to watch Weird Science again, damn it.  All right, man.  I'll see you later, man.  Keith, thanks for the great phone call, man.  Take it easy.  Keith Robinson, everyone.  You got a plug, Keith?  Yeah, my plug is... 
[01:03:30]  What's my plug?  No, no plug.  I ain't got no plug.  Oh, damn.  Fuck.  All right, see you.  All right, Keith.  One other thing out there.  One, Keith Robinson.  One, Keith.  I'm following Keith, so...  I got to fucking pop him up, yeah.  Yeah, you can check the people I'm following, and Keith, I just...  I didn't realize I wasn't following you, and I saw your tweet, and I'm like, fuck, so...  Yeah, I saw it last night, man.  Well, don't follow him.  He'll fucking punch you.  Oh, I know.  Keith punches you if you follow him at the cellar.  It's too low, man.  I think that Twitter's going to be connected to whether you can even get a health care. 
[01:04:00]  Let's get Keith Robinson's numbers up today, man.  Let's get my numbers up.  Yeah, let's get him up.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  See you, man.  Keith Robinson.  It was funny when Keith said that the fucking guy should be calling us.  He's good, man.  I love Keith.  He's great.  But it was a very funny expression, a bitch-made dude.  No white guy would ever think of that expression.  Right, right, yeah.  It's just a great expression to use for a person.  He's a bitch-made dude. 
[01:04:30]  Kenny?  Yeah, that's great.  If I may put my two cents in.  Sure, Kenny.  I don't want to belabor the point, Anthony, but once again, I disagree with you.  Okay.  And I side with Keith.  It's not black emotion.  That busy buddy should have minded his own business.  I absolutely see that both people in this situation obviously made a mistake because  one is dead and one's on trial for his life.  What was Trayvon's mistake?  Trayvon's mistake was punching him in the face, was punching George Zimmerman in the 
[01:05:00]  face and then bashing his head against the sidewalk at some point.  A physical altercation for just following somebody, or even if he said, hey, motherfucker,  what are you doing in this neighborhood?  Which isn't really indicative of what he was about.  There's no history of him harassing people in his neighborhood.  That, where was the incentive for Trayvon to punch him?  He did.  This isn't speculation. 
[01:05:30]  He did assault George Zimmerman.  Well, I'll say this.  I don't know any details.  Right.  So, generally speaking, though, you know, he should have minded his own business.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  You're right.  You're right.  It would have been better for everyone involved if he minded his own business.  I hear you.  Is it possible that one of these, like, let's just say he tried, not holding Trayvon there,  but let's say Trayvon said, what the fuck are you doing?  He goes, well, you're not going anywhere because he knew the cops were coming. 
[01:06:00]  And maybe, is it possible he said, no, no, no, stay right here.  And then Trayvon said, and then, and then, if that's the case.  It's all possible.  Let's just say Zimmerman tried to keep him there for a second.  Uh-huh.  And Trayvon fucking punched him because here's this guy trying to keep him here.  Yeah.  Then, what do you think?  I don't know.  It didn't seem like one punch.  I mean, and.  No, no, but he doesn't know who George Zimmerman is.  Let's just say, all of a sudden, this guy who's been following him and gets out of his  car to follow him, and all of a sudden says, no, no, no, you're staying right here.  And then he gets to that, like, maybe he's fucking hitting him. 
[01:06:30]  What happens after you're staying right here?  You got the speculation part, but it's not, no follow-through.  Maybe he punches him because he feels threatened by that statement.  Okay, he punches him, and then what?  Runs?  Zimmerman fights back.  There's no indication on Zimmerman.  There was nothing that indicated he got any shots in on Trayvon.  He didn't have any bruising or cuts on his knuckles.  Trayvon didn't have any signs of anything on him.  No, no, no.  Let's just say he grappled.  You know how it is on a fight.  A little grappling?  Yeah, let's just say, like, Zimmerman got punched, and this guy just starts hitting him  because he just told me to come here. 
[01:07:00]  Physical evidence was also that he was then banging his head against the sidewalk,  the back of George Zimmerman's head.  Where does it stop to where, all right, you're staying here.  No, I'm not staying here.  One punch, and then you run away.  If someone's trying to keep you somewhere, if you want to...  And this is all speculation.  All speculation.  All fucking...  Again, this isn't going to be in court.  What's going to...  Kenny, regardless of what you said, how do you think this will turn out in court? 
[01:07:30]  Well, I want to say, too, for the record, that I hate shittums.  Which makes it more interesting that Kenny's speaking up.  Right, right.  Because we know he hates shittums.  We all know that.  You've got to take a step back.  What's with this neighborhood watch?  Was this like a condominium association that had an organized thing?  And how do you know that Zimmerman had any type of power? 
[01:08:00]  Was he wearing a uniform or anything?  He doesn't have any power.  He has absolutely zero...  Well, I mean, in that whole neighborhood watch world.  You had to even know what his intention is.  Did he have a uniform or not?  Yeah.  Did he look like sort of a security guy?  No, no.  He looked like a fucking regular guy.  Exactly.  Yeah, that's not...  He didn't have any authority.  No authority whatsoever in that neighborhood.  Even though I liked Robert Zimmerman when he was in it,  there's certain things that make it really hard.  Like the moments that you and I argued about or talked about, 
[01:08:30]  and then Keith brought up,  was that moment of him,  you have gun confidence,  you get out of the car,  and that moment where,  how does Trayvon get to you?  Yeah, there's that moment where that's the gray area  where no one really knows what happened,  and it's only based on George Zimmerman's statements.  And some audio witnesses,  there were people that heard things,  they were on the phone with 911,  there's where they were when it happened,  where Trayvon's body was, 
[01:09:00]  where the car was,  like all that.  Can I give you my two cents?  But no real,  hey, this is what was said,  here's what happened.  Like that's an area that,  to break it down,  there's no real evidence.  I think the gun made Zimmerman's dick bigger,  and I think Trayvon Martin,  because possibly his culture was like,  well, fuck this,  I ain't fucking running away.  And then now you got,  you know,  two fucking guys in a situation.  It just goes to show,  it's best to not get into any kind of altercation with anybody, 
[01:09:30]  isn't it?  Because you don't know,  you don't know who you're dealing with at any given moment.  That's why I asked Keith that question.  Because I know,  in general,  in general,  in the white culture,  we're going to fucking run.  Just run,  leave.  In most instances.  Leave the situation.  Where we know we don't have the upper hand.  Generally speaking,  too,  again,  I don't know the detail.  Right.  But,  you can't claim self-defense  if you instigated or initiated the situation.  There's an escalation, 
[01:10:00]  though,  Kenny.  If you,  they might not consider what he did initiating.  If he's following someone,  it's not initiating something.  If someone turns around and starts threatening your life,  and you feel like your life is being threatened,  because you were following him,  and then they turned around and did something to you,  and escalated it,  you can claim self-defense on that.  What did George Zimmerman do  that instigated or initiated him being assaulted?  I don't know. 
[01:10:30]  I don't know any details.  Exactly.  No one does.  That's just it.  That's why.  It's,  it'll be,  you know,  be it hard in court.  Hopefully,  he'll get a good judge and a good jury,  and he's got a good attorney.  And a fair trial.  And regardless,  he's screwed in a civil case.  Oh,  he's done.  He's done.  And,  yeah.  They're going to also sue the Condominity Association  if he's,  you know,  part of a neighborhood watch.  Oh,  believe me,  they won the tragedy lottery on this one. 
[01:11:00]  I get that.  And Kenny hates shittims.  Well,  of course,  he said that.  He hates shittims.  He did say that.  I did hear that.  yeah,  we,  no one,  no one knows what happened,  but,  but the way it looks and what,  what is being presented,  there's,  there's enough there where,  there's enough doubt.  It's just enough doubt.  I don't know,  Kenny.  I think he's walking.  Oh,  good for him.  He might,  but,  you know,  my,  my thing is,  you know,  go back to square one. 
[01:11:30]  He should have minded his fucking business.  All right.  Yeah.  Or just,  or just called or stayed in the car and just called and said,  he went that way.  And yeah,  yeah.  But the hoodie thing is tough because even though I know what you mean about,  yeah,  a lot of thugs,  please,  I,  they,  they're wearing hoodies,  but it's such a legitimate piece of clothing.  It really,  I mean,  I wear them every day to five.  We're now.  It's such a legit.  Look at you.  It's a tonight show.  Hoodie.  Stop.  Well,  you know,  Jay motherfucking Leno,  y'all representing,  but I mean,  it's,  it's one of those things where it's such a legitimate piece of clothing. 
[01:12:00]  It's like a baseball cap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's such a fucking jock thing or average.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The stocking cap is your,  your,  your only thing is either you're a vagina or you have a gun and you're robbing somebody.  You know,  hoodie is a rough one.  I gotcha.  I know.  I know.  I'm just,  and that's where the professionals have the experience to know the difference.  Well,  exactly.  In the sixth sense.  Yes.  Right.  And you got a lot of material today for your fucking Twitter,  man.  Oh,  forget about it.  I'm poolside today. 
[01:12:30]  Friends.  Holy fuck.  Poolside.  Can't wait to read some,  some of the tweets today.  Don't be a bitch made dude.  A bitch made,  my fuck was a bitch made dude.  That keeps great,  man.  We should take a break.  Yeah.  Let's eat our,  our fucking prefix.  And we have to,  I'd love when we come back,  if we could discuss Kenny's recent troubles,  because we're all very concerned.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  Kenny.  That's exactly what we're going to do next.  And I understand one thing.  Somebody,  uh,  didn't sound quite,  quite like themselves.  Oh,  we got that.  This,  somebody touched on. 
[01:13:00]  I won't even explain.  I won't.  Don't explain.  But someone touched on Twitter,  and I had to,  I was like,  holy fuck yes.  Yeah,  we'll explain next.  Well,  I want to say too,  for the record,  that I hate shitums.  You guys are back for the toilet.  Now,  back to our show.  You'll be at the show.  General Secretary Gorbachev, 
[01:13:30]  if you seek peace,  if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,  if you seek liberalization,  come here to this gate.  Mr. Gorbachev,  open this gate.  I thought he said,  tear down this wall.  Yes.  Oh,  sorry.  Mr. Gorbachev,  tear down this wall.  Yes.  Yes, Mr. Gorbachev. 
[01:14:00]  I'm more into the song.  Is this just the instrumental?  I agree.  Starts off all nice.  Starts off all nice. 
[01:14:30]  The toxicity of our city, of our city.  No!  What do you own the world?  How do you own this order?  This order?  No!  Somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep.  Somewhere between the sacred silence.  And the sacred silence and sleep.  It's order! 
[01:15:00]  It's order!  It's order!  I like this one.  These guys have a really original sound, man.  Absolutely, I like it.  The Reagan thing was 26 years ago today.  Yes.  What happened?  I don't know.  I will.  Wow, that wasn't that long ago.  He said, Mr. Gorbachev, get that Pink Floyd out on the wall.  That's kind of funny.  I thought that was funny. 
[01:15:30]  Sure it is.  You're right.  You bring some gay haters.  Mr. Gorbachev, listen to the wall.  Yeah!  The Pink Floyd record, you gotta say.  Yeah, no gay, alright.  Mr. Gorbachev, go get the Pink Floyd record, listen to it.  The one that's called The Wall.  Oh, that's even better, Chip.  I know.  No, it's not.  Any Chip vines today?  I love the magic trick.  Chip tried a couple of vines just staring pensively at the window and it just didn't...  Staring? 
[01:16:00]  What a dullard.  Yeah, just staring.  Like what Chip thinks is like a deep, like, ponderous look.  Oh, China.  Oh, God, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Like, look at him.  I'm a thinking man.  I'm just kind of looking and wondering about life.  What the fuck, life?  What you got for me today?  Put that right there.  It's a garbage.  Still no updates on the Vine fucking app. 
[01:16:30]  Speaking of Vine.  Fucking hate.  Hey, little buddy there.  Oh, please.  I have to address...  Why do you do that?  Oh, that's great.  Why did I do it?  It was Aussie day yesterday.  I don't know why I did it.  Jimmy gets very excited when it's Aussie day.  We were in the middle of talking to Robert Zimmerman, and Jimmy got word that Aussie  was pretty much waiting to come in.  And Gieser.  And Gieser, of course.  Gieser Butler.  Yeah.  And the look on Jimmy's face.  I saw Jimmy losing his mind. 
[01:17:00]  His eyes are big.  His head was twitching around.  He didn't know what to do.  He had his phone in his hand.  He's looking at everyone like, help, help.  Somebody do something.  I knew exactly what was happening.  Do you understand what's going on here?  You guys were very understanding.  I appreciate it.  I knew exactly what was happening.  I looked at the clock.  I'm like, okay.  Aussie's ready.  So, yeah.  We'll take a break.  I'm glad Robert waited.  He was nice to wait.  He was nice.  And he was a good guest.  I was like, maybe they could do the music first.  Then, because I texted E-Rod, but they couldn't.  So, I was like, ha, ha, what am I? 
[01:17:30]  Hi.  It's like, we'll bring him in.  But then Aussie came in, and then Jimmy did something that was very strange.  Great appearance by Aussie.  Another great appearance.  Hilarious.  I didn't pick up on the Jimmy thing right away.  I didn't.  I had to find out on Twitter.  I saw it.  Oh, my God.  I heard it.  And then I was like, I was going to say something.  And then Aussie started talking, and I was like, it kind of lost me.  But it was there.  Oh, it was there.  Yeah.  It was. 
[01:18:00]  Aussie Osborne.  How you doing, Aussie?  Take a seat, my friend.  Hello.  Hi, guys.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Take a seat.  How you doing?  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That's it.  What the?  Yeah.  You need a vessel.  Why?  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  I think I got nervous.  Just going to the gym.  But you kind of jammed eating better, you fucking good.  But you kind of started it. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, you did.  But I was doing an impression, like, obviously.  Jim wasn't doing a good one.  No.  Jim just started talking.  That's what white people do when they interview rappers.  Black people.  Absolutely.  However, it was only for that one line.  You were winglish.  Yeah.  I'm whitish.  Whitish.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  You said that's it.  I just cut out eating.  It's not even English.  Right, exactly.  You're going to turn, like, Irish or Scottish.  Yeah, right.  I love you. 
[01:19:00]  I want to matter you.  But I want to go.  I want to go.  Yeah, right.  It really wasn't British.  It was just a...  Oh, no.  I got Irish.  I want that as a ringtone.  Me, too.  I can listen to you fucking sound like that all day.  It's a ringtone when the douche factory calls.  Oh.  The douche.  Jesus.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better. 
[01:19:30]  That's it.  That's what I heard.  I just cut out eating late at night and just awful food that I was eating.  And on the road, it's hard.  Because I get a lot of crap on the road.  And then you go back to regular gym.  Right back.  I just had that moment of pain.  You had a moment of fucking some kingdom speech.  Did you know you did that?  At the time?  But it was not...  It wasn't to try to sound as hard.  What happened was, I'm always amazed.  Because I didn't think Ozzy really recognized me.  And the last time I saw him, he was like, you lost weight.  Yeah.  And then I see him again.  And he's like, you look good. 
[01:20:00]  You lost weight.  Huh.  Oh, the fucking gym.  I just...  That's enough.  Stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  That's enough.  Just going to the gym.  Eating better.  Oh, I am a true...  I am a true cunt.  I can't get enough of English.  I heard the sound drop yesterday.  I really laughed. 
[01:20:30]  I'm a fucking cunt.  That is fan-fucking-tastic.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yes.  What have you been eating?  Well, I've been eating various cheeses.  I'm bigger than cheeses.  What?  Cheeses?  Cheeses and potatoes.  Potatoes.  Yeah, I don't know.  And then you quickly go back to just gym.  Yeah, I just...  Then I relax.  So strange.  I love Ozzy.  I love him.  You still get nervous when he comes in here, huh?  It was almost like...  It's like, yeah, it's still Ozzy Osbourne.  I mean, it's not nearly as bad as it was. 
[01:21:00]  Like, you know, I'm comfortable.  And I knew I had that town hall last night.  So I'm more comfortable.  I'm fine with them.  And the town hall went well?  It went great.  I was really...  And they were extremely happy with it.  Hey!  Thank you for me, goom!  Yeah, thank you for the chewing stuff.  Hey!  It's English, Jimmy!  Fucking English, Jimmy!  I don't know what he is.  He's Scottish.  He's Irish.  He's English.  Yes.  Jim the cunt.  Jim the fucking cunt.  So yeah, it was really good. 
[01:21:30]  And it was streaming on, like, YouTube and fucking Google Plus Hangout.  I was really...  I was very, very happy.  And it was...  The technical stuff went pretty well.  It was very, very little issues.  Tony was on remote.  And it was where Noam got married.  Where Noam, the owner of the Comedy Cellar...  It was a temple on Norfolk Street down right below...  Houston, and it's this fucking badass temple.  I'll show you photos of it inside.  A badass temple?  It's fucking...  Never heard of that.  Really nice, man.  Some of these places look badass. 
[01:22:00]  I understand what Jimmy's talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  It had, like, an old church vibe, and there was, like, 500 fans there.  Yeah.  When I wander around New York, I walk into every fucking church and temple.  And some of them are badass.  Yeah, because it's amazing, the architect.  Yeah, yeah.  The texture.  Well, we had a good time.  And you know how it is when you're hanging with the guys.  Just yapping for a while with the guys.  Hiya, Ozzy.  Yeah.  Very good to see ya, ya mother fucker.  Were you yapping afterwards?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, Ozzy was telling me about his little bit of work and that. 
[01:22:30]  You know how it is.  A couple of guys talking about their workout schedules.  The jam.  Yeah, just hitting the jam.  Hitting the jam.  Hitting the jam.  Hitting the jam.  You know, you're just chatting with people, you know.  Yeah.  Bunch of buddies.  Nice.  Just hanging out.  Yeah, what?  I don't know.  Oi.  Ozzy's always after me lucky charms.  And we have to figure out how to give away.  At one point we'll do this.  The Sabbath 13.  It was number one in 50 countries as of last night on iTunes.  Fucking.  It's going to be the biggest record they ever did.  And we have the copy signed. 
[01:23:00]  Like a Best Buy copy, I think, with a shirt in it.  And signed by Ozzy and Geezer.  That's great, yeah.  Yeah, we were going to give it away yesterday.  But I'm like, let's try to get it signed.  And then rolling up them to sign on their way out.  Sweet.  We'll figure out a way to get.  Oh, that's what you didn't say right.  Sweet.  Sweet.  Nice.  You don't like that?  No.  I give this to a listener.  I like sweet.  Sweet.  I like that one, Jimmy.  You like that?  Yes, I like when you do that.  Oh, he's so fucking good.  Is there any one? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, please.  I don't know where it is.  Please.  We destroyed it already.  I just want to hear it one more time.  I can't get it.  Somebody wrote, he hoped Ozzy would say, that accent, you wouldn't be from Liverpool, would  you?  Ozzy Osbourne.  How you doing, Ozzy?  Take a seat, my friend.  What's up, man?  Take a seat.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym and eat better. 
[01:24:00]  Let's go to the gym.  I don't want to go.  Fat bastard.  Go to the gym.  Eating better.  And you did that.  You're like, eating better.  Eating better.  That's all.  Just eating better.  My mouth wouldn't work properly for a second.  No, no.  It's just...  I know.  I'm a man from many nations.  It just turned into, like, a fucking chimney sweep. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, gonna pick a pocket or two.  Hey.  Jimmy.  That's very funny.  James McNorton.  Hey, James McNorton with you, don't you know?  Hey.  So we got Farrah Abraham coming in here, right?  Yes.  Hey, that's that, what, teen mom?  Oh, yeah.  One of the teen moms who made the sex tape, I guess.  What does she look like?  I don't know much about this.  Actually, it's a porno. 
[01:25:00]  Pop it up there.  She was all in on this.  Yeah, it was pretty good, the porno, actually.  You saw the whole thing?  Well, no, but I saw some of it.  And I'll tell you something, a lot of times you get the pseudo-celebrity porno thing, and  it's very dull, like, there's nothing really going on.  She's a trooper.  Let me ask you this.  Trooper with the pooper.  Where did she take the cream?  Right in the fucking mush.  Right in the face.  She took the cream on the face? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Close the curtains.  God forbid.  Well, we have to.  So, she's going to be here in a few minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Seth Rogen.  That's pretty good.  This is the end.  I'm glad I haven't seen that movie yet.  I like the movie a lot.  One of the New York papers liked the movie a lot, and then I read a review from fucking  some stupid fucking broad today.  Drove me nuts.  She didn't get it?  No.  No?  No, because she feels like we're looking in at these guys having wonderful lives,  and we're looking into the VIP area. 
[01:26:00]  Who gives a fuck?  Isn't that kind of cool?  Yeah, they were playing exaggerated versions of themselves in this movie.  Oh, she hated the movie.  Which one?  I don't even know what fucking paper it was.  I mean, I could find it really fast.  I think Rotten Tomatoes in general has given it very good reviews.  This is the end.  She's sexy, Farrah.  Fuck.  Well, to just take the newspaper and wrap your fish and chips in it?  What's that?  Hi.  Go to the gym.  Eating batter. 
[01:26:30]  Eating batter.  Eating batter.  Fish and chips in the phone.  Thank you, Alex.  Elizabeth Weitzman in the Daily News.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She had a problem with it.  Yeah, but her problems were like, who gives a fuck?  Hmm.  Let me see.  It's fun at first when these famous faces tweak their own images, but is there really anything 
[01:27:00]  clever about Hill pointing out that he's an Oscar nominee?  That line in the movie killed.  It was hilarious.  Because he's in this shitty situation.  Oh, man.  What an ass on her.  Watching, uh...  Dude, she's a great...  How about full screen there, Sam?  I don't understand why you like the micro screen.  I do.  Yeah?  He's a sucker of penises.  Yeah, baby.  Come pedal.  Oh, boy.  She's a great ass.  Because I like this.  Like what? 
[01:27:30]  This?  That.  I think I like this right here.  She's pointing at his cock, ladies and gentlemen.  She's touching it.  Good girl.  What the hell?  Did you wear armor today?  I wore pants and a t-shirt.  I love the witty repartee they got going.  It's very natural.  Yeah.  They're going to take me forever.  Really?  Yeah.  She's pretty good for a fucking amateur, though.  I don't understand.  That's just it.  She comes across as a real good porn actress there.  Whoa.  That guy James Dean?  Yes.  Okay.  Whoa.  Women love this guy.  Look at that. 
[01:28:00]  Right there.  You're a big master.  Tell me how you like it.  Oh, man.  I think you're doing fine.  I don't need any advice, I tell you.  If she did that, she wouldn't be a teen mom.  Right.  Fucking a peck up.  Yeah.  She's fucking this peck up.  Got it.  Wow.  What does she expect to get from this?  Come.  Yeah.  She's doing a good job.  Because we're going to do anal.  Whoa.  She'll probably get a lot of money for her next one.  We'll do that first, and then we'll do more.  The first thing we're going to do is do anal. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Wow, what a ass I heard.  You're going to put up your ass?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come here.  Loves, I loves, get ready.  Come here.  Come here.  We're going to get ready, take a big dump?  No, my ass is shy.  Yeah.  Your ass is shy?  I'm so shy.  I don't want to see you anymore.  And you better be careful.  What?  I'll be way back, baby.  What a juicy ass.  What do you mean to be careful?  I don't know, not fucking too hard.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus.  And now she's kneeling, and she's, uh.  This is a pretty good porno.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  She's sucking his peck up.  She's fluffing him.  It's a little anal.  Yeah.  Now she's still sucking his peck up.  Uh-oh.  Now she's back, she stopped, and now she's sucking his peck up again.  She's holding his peck up.  Now she's looking at his peck up.  All right.  Now she's back up.  Uh-oh.  He's got his pecker in her.  He's playing with a clit with a pecker inside of her.  He's got his hand on her leg and his other hand on her clit, and he's putting his big 
[01:29:30]  pecker inside of her.  She's moaning because she loves his pecker.  She's got her head on a pillow while he slams her cooter with his pecker.  That's a cool picture right there.  You can see her butthole and his pecker slamming in and out real fast.  Now it's out.  Now it's in.  Now it's out.  Now it's in.  Now it's out.  Now it's in.  He's holding her butt cheeks while he puts his pecker into her really hard and fast.  She's saying dirty words while he slams his pecker into her. 
[01:30:00]  It's out.  It's out.  It's in.  It's out.  It's out.  It's out.  It's in.  It's out.  It's in.  It's out.  It's in.  It's out.  It's in.  And his balls are jiggling behind his pecker.  You can still see her butt cheeks.  Now he moves his hand.  Now he's playing with her clitoris.  Now he's behind her.  Oh, Jesus.  Now he's moving her hair because it's on her shoulder, and he's holding her hips, and he's putting  his pecker in her pussy really hard.  He's giving it to her good.  That's the way I fuck. 
[01:30:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  Take that, pecker.  Take that fucking pecker.  Good job, Chip.  Now fucking say that.  Take that fucking pecker.  You're so fucking hard.  Oh, man.  He's giving her a good pecker, Roger.  I love that cock.  I love that cock.  She's holding her boobs while he puts it because she doesn't want no one to see her boobs.  And then the scene's just over.  That's it.  Back door teen mom.  Why would you have to buy that?  That's all you would need right there.  The anal is what people want to see.  Oh, that's why they tease that shit, huh? 
[01:31:00]  He is women.  When you watch a guy just fuck like that, you're like, I want to be that guy.  That guy's a good lady.  I need such nipple stimulation.  I could never fuck you hard and play with your clit.  My dick would just wilt.  I'd have to play with my nips.  I'm awful.  But you can't get things going without the nipple play.  I'm lucky I can get to fucking work in the morning without nipple play.  Well, we're going to have her in in a few minutes.  Yeah, huh? 
[01:31:30]  I hear she's terrific.  Yeah, she's sexy.  Oh, boy.  The review for This Is The End doesn't matter after seeing that.  Do you have the, you know, yeah, just.  What happened?  I said we should film it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to go, what's up, baby?  Let me just read this paragraph, though.  Where are you from?  Please.  And it's just, I don't know why it bothers me.  She writes, it's fun at first.  Oh.  It's the porn girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The porn is fun at first.  When these famous faces tweak their own images.  But is there any really, anything really clever about Hill pointing out that he's an Oscar 
[01:32:00]  nominee or Franco acknowledging that he's obscenely wealthy?  That was hilarious.  Because the party's at his house and he's pointing out all the stuff that he's bought  with his money that's just ridiculous and over the top.  It is funny because it's almost like people saying things that we know they only think but  don't say.  That's the funny part.  The truth is, self-mockery is really just a form of self-congratulations.  These guys can afford to make fun of themselves because, as they repeatedly remind us, they're 
[01:32:30]  a lot more successful than the average ticket buyer.  Who's thinking that?  Yeah.  I think that's why it bothers me.  Who's thinking that when they go to a movie that's kind of funny?  Overthinking.  There are laughs here, but don't be fooled by the in-joke vibe.  They aren't inviting you to the party.  What?  They're inviting you to stand on the other side of the velvet rope to watch them have  a blast in the VIP area.  What is she talking about?  I usually don't read movie reviews, but you're on the same page now. 
[01:33:00]  What is she talking about?  It's right.  It's a movie.  You're watching a movie.  It sounds like she wants to be more famous than she is.  She's taking it out on these guys who figured out a way to really fucking make a very different  movie.  They're having fun.  She's not part of it.  Right.  So instead of just watching, she gets all angry about it.  Not once while I'm laughing my ass off in the theater.  Am I thinking, God, I really wish I was part of their world.  You know? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  So that's Elizabeth Weitzman.  Not an accurate review whatsoever.  That's why I'm sticking up for Seth Rogen on this one.  But I think in general, the reviews are very, very good for This Is The End.  Yeah.  But we're on the other side of the velvet ropes.  Other side of the velvet rope.  Yeah.  No one overthinks that when they're watching a movie.  It's a movie.  Holy fuck.  And they're playing the exaggerated version of themselves.  They always overthink reviews and stuff. 
[01:34:00]  Not always, but when they're bad reviews, they're usually overthought.  But, you know, I think using the wheel for the metaphor of, shut up and enjoy the movie.  They take themselves way too seriously.  That's the problem.  I think her review is as if we're watching somebody masturbating themselves and not able  to get a tug in on ourselves.  Yeah.  It's like you're watching someone tug their own P.E.K.K.A., but you can't tug yours because  you're busy. 
[01:34:30]  The P.E.K.K.A. again.  P.E.K.K.A.  Why don't we break?  Okay.  Because we have, like, Father's Day reads.  Oh, boy.  And then we're going to get Farrah Abraham in here.  And then we're going to have Seth Rogen, the star, the producer, I believe.  No, the director, the star, and the writer of...  This is the...  Damn!  He wrote it with his writing partner.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a great movie.  So, you mean lover?  About that?  When you say that?  Well, you might have to ask.  Lover.  We're going to get to take a break now and just fucking relax or something. 
[01:35:00]  English chip.  Fuck, yeah.  That would be funny.  Just call you fish and chip.  Fuck, yeah.  When he's English.  You're English.  Get a word, you're not wise.  Wait, that would be funny.  Oh, it's okay.  What's the best gift to give your woman?  Your woman in your life?  I think it's a handkerchief.  And she gives you one and you hold her with her.

[01:37:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more. 
[01:37:30]  Let's get Farrah in here.  Yes, Farrah Abraham.  Farrah Abraham.  I am teen mom.  Teen mom with a porno.  Hi.  Hi, Farrah.  Take a seat right there.  How are you doing?  Oh, it's actually comfy and warm in here.  Yeah, yeah.  But some people come in and say it smells like a men's locker room, though.  Okay, whatever.  It's kind of a guy vibe thing going in here.  Look at you.  You're all like Hollywood.  You look like, you know.  You're polished.  You look like a celebrity. 
[01:38:00]  That's pretty good.  Nice, I guess.  Yeah, it is.  It's a compliment.  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  So what are they making the rounds?  Were you just doing Howie?  Yeah.  I just did Howard Stern and I had a great interview.  He's really nice.  Yeah, it was nice.  It wasn't like he was.  Did he ask anything embarrassing?  I think he was just too worried about bowel movements.  But other than that, it was okay.  Oh, he must have been too.  Okay, all right.  Well, obviously, your video.  There's some backdoor action, I guess.  Yeah.  Was he?  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  I mean, everyone keeps making it a big deal.  I'm like, what's the issue?  People have sex.  People have anal sex.  I know.  The thing is, like, for guys, it's kind of that, like, wow.  You know?  I think anal's replaced the blowjob as, like, the big thing to get if you're a guy.  Like, years ago, it was really a head, I think.  I think it was more like, like, wow, I can't believe I'm getting a blowjob.  Anal was out of the fucking question.  Really?  Yeah.  I feel sorry for those couples, then.  I don't know.  It was like, I'm talking mega years ago. 
[01:39:00]  In the days before girls shaved down.  That's fucking, yeah.  I don't know.  Let me tell you a little story.  The dark ages.  There was a, yeah, there was a dark.  Okay, we called these the dark times.  The dark ages.  It was, yeah, yeah, they never shaved down back then.  You used to have to do this weird thing like you were pulling apart, like, hedges to peek through at your neighbor.  Okay, it's a little weird, yeah.  Why is it weird?  I mean, because I'm not about that.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, I know. 
[01:39:30]  I just want to get the...  I mean, some women probably still do that.  Some people probably still don't get blowjobs.  I don't know.  Yeah, probably.  You're right on both counts.  Some women don't shave and don't give head.  Yeah, yeah, Jimmy.  Those women should die alone.  I think they do.  And the anal's no big deal, because I think you did it when you were 15 anyway, right?  Yeah.  Really?  She did anal at 15.  Jesus.  Wow.  You've got to read the bio.  Yeah, yeah, that is a good one.  I usually don't read the bio, but...  Yeah, this one was very interesting.  Wow. 
[01:40:00]  How did you come to this, where you were doing a movie?  Because it's amazing how many people saw your movie.  And it's hard to...  That is pretty amazing.  It's hard to make an impression in adult films now, because there's so many, and it's all  over it.  It's hard just to come in and all of a sudden just stand out.  You know what?  It's very weird, but in my life, I have gotten a lot of attention.  I don't know why.  Like, my first book, New York Times bestseller.  My first shows were top rated.  I don't know why that is.  I didn't know you wrote a book.  What was the book?  My Teenage Dream Ended. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  What happened?  Like, what was...  I was just writing...  It was a memoir about my teen years.  Mm-hmm.  And it was...  The struggles, like depression, the loss of my boyfriend, those type of things that  I went through.  And so now I'm just moving on from that.  You know, I'm progressing to adulthood.  And, you know, that's some of what my new show that's going to be coming out is about.  And I'm, you know, blessed.  I get to work with Spin Boy Films on that.  And, you know, I'm just...  And a mother and an adult.  And I think lots of people don't understand that.  And I think that's why things are a shock. 
[01:41:00]  Like, Farrah's having sex.  Well, I don't know how that's a shock because I've had a daughter.  And, you know, I'm still trying to date.  I'm still trying to be a normal 20-something-year-old that has sex.  So I think it's just more of a shocker.  And I don't understand why, though.  People are pretty fascinated with the whole sexual thing.  Especially if you'd been in the public eye before.  Like, okay, we knew you from, you know, being a teen mom and things like that.  But we didn't know that. 
[01:41:30]  And then all of a sudden, like, when a celebrity kind of has a sex tape, it gets a lot of attention.  It gets a lot of attention.  And you were very good in it.  I don't get sex much, so...  When I get it, let's take advantage.  Yeah.  Are you in a relationship?  Are you dating?  No, I'm single.  And I'll probably be single for a while.  Really?  Yep.  By choice.  Like, that's just a silly question.  By choice.  No, force her into it.  No, no guys are asking around, Angie. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I get asked out and I get lots of, like, flattering things and attention.  But I just feel like I can't just trust anybody.  I mean, a guy can act so nice and trustworthy at first.  And that's, you know, what I've been kind of fucked over in the past with.  And so that's why I just don't even go there right now.  Because I really don't need any more sexual attention or any other guy taking advantage  of just being in my life or being intimate with me.  Yeah.  How did this whole thing, this whole road for you start? 
[01:42:30]  Like, where you...  I was like every other teenager.  I was a cheerleader.  I was very popular growing up.  And then I ended up getting pregnant.  I was on birth control.  I was doing modeling and axing at the time.  I told one of my coaches who were helping me.  So she was, you know, just at MTV's casting, you know, for some show.  They need pregnant teens.  I did a video.  I sent it in.  I got the call back.  And it's, you know, like four years later.  And here I am.  Wow.  Would you have... 
[01:43:00]  And I know your boyfriend was killed.  Yeah.  And if...  When you went into, like, you're doing...  You did the film now.  Do you think that that's...  Were you kind of thinking of doing that anyway?  Or was that one of those things that just...  I mean, I think all of us...  Maybe I shouldn't say that.  But I know in my life and my friends' lives and where I am in life, I think all of us  are like, either we've already done a video or we're going to think about doing a video  or we're going to get those sex sets.  I think it's just, you know, embracing your young self for when you're older and you can 
[01:43:30]  look back on that.  And so that's kind of where I was in my life.  I mean, I really just feel like I'm old enough.  I know that, you know, I feel great and I'm happy where I am in life and I just, you know,  I wanted to do that right now.  Did they approach you about it and say, look, this is a good deal?  Or did you say, I wanted to do it and put the feelers out?  Who approached me?  How my sex thing came about, I did that with, like, a person I was talking to at the time.  And some, you know, some things went negative in our relationship and he kind of wanted 
[01:44:00]  to become popular off of doing it.  And so I dealt with it legally because otherwise I would have been fucked over and everyone would  have seen me naked for free.  So, I mean, that's kind of how it came about.  And people reached out to my lawyer and I went from there.  Oh, so that wasn't a movie that you did that you were, like, contracted to do?  I was never contracted to do one.  I didn't realize that.  Okay, so that's just one that you're, like, you're not releasing this and just taking  all this money.  There's only one video of me ever having sex. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  So.  So I'm saying that that one, it wasn't something, like, that you discussed before.  You thought that was going to remain private.  It definitely should have remained private.  And it's fine that it's out now.  Yeah, I am.  Okay.  Honestly, everyone has sex and I really don't care.  So, see me naked.  You have sex and probably more sex than I do.  So, whatever.  It was very well done for something that should have just been, like, you know, between two 
[01:45:00]  people.  Everyone says this, so I should say, like, thanks for the compliment.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess I had amazing lighting.  It was, like, everything.  Yeah, very good lighting and everything.  It was framed well.  Could, like, see the action.  But here's the thing.  Like, also, James' background, like, he has, like, done films before, obviously.  And I have done TV work.  And I think when your brains are already wired to do things properly.  Second nature to just.  Things are just beautiful.  Things turn out better. 
[01:45:30]  And I think, you know, I wouldn't want a tape that looked like shit anyways to keep.  So, there's no plans of doing any more?  No.  I'm sure you've had offers though, right?  I mean, I don't think.  Lots of weird things have occurred since then.  Yeah.  But, no.  Even if I were married, I don't think it would be the right thing to ever do another video.  Yeah.  I just don't think I could trust.  What kind of weird offers?  Like, different companies.  Wanting to, like, put me in the position of being, like, a porn star.  Right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  I think that's not even in my vocabulary.  Like, I don't even want to be about that.  Are you annoyed that he did this?  Or are you, like, happy?  I was annoyed.  You know what?  It's been, like, months now.  I'm really over it.  And I'm, you know, just happy I covered my own ass.  So.  Yeah.  That's smart.  I mean, if this.  Well, so to speak.  So to speak.  So to speak.  That's right.  Of course.  But what do you got working on now?  What's the new show?  Um, so it's. 
[01:46:30]  I think we're working with the title of Finding Farrah.  And I think it's just, you know, coming into womanhood.  You know, seeing what the adult life of Farrah is.  Rather than the teen life.  That others are used to.  So.  And like I said, I'm working with Spin Boy Films.  And they're based here out of New York.  What'll it show you doing?  Oh, it'll show me doing restaurant stuff.  You know, relationships with my parents.  Also, where my daughter is.  She's far right now.  And there's a lot of things of, like, you know, is it time for a cell phone?  Like, what are these things?  Like, there's a lot of, like, trial and error. 
[01:47:00]  But also, like, I guess finding, finding where I fit in, really.  Did you have to, like, sit your parents down and go, hey, it's like this.  You're going to be hearing about the tape.  I never.  Oh.  About the video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I mean, do you go tell your parents that you're going to go have sex with your girlfriend?  My parents know because they actually, they encourage us to fuck.  I'm a nicer person when I fuck.  No.  No.  But you got to admit, it's a little different that it got out there. 
[01:47:30]  Well, yeah, when it came about and it was in the public, my mother just texted me and  was like, you need to handle this because somebody is, like, trying to get attention.  And so that's what I did.  Yeah.  So, and then it turned into some other things because of Dr. Phil and just mind manipulation  with my parents.  And, you know, I just have boundaries and I love my parents no matter what.  But.  Yeah.  They are where they are and I am where I am.  What do you mean to turn this up because of Dr. Phil? 
[01:48:00]  So, negativity, more negativity than what was needed.  I think if you're going to talk about sex and if you're going to try to be there for  your daughter or somebody else who's dealing with a public situation, it's better that  you come together and talk and have resolution and grow from it rather than creating more  fights and more tension.  And I think Dr. Phil does a great job at that.  And I want to be proud.  God damn that Dr. Phil.  Dr. Phil is a fucking piece of shit.  Oh, he really is. 
[01:48:30]  Many say.  He's thrown himself into more situations like a tornado.  Well, because he's just getting it.  Because he wants ratings.  Yeah.  He's just trying to get his ratings.  It's good business for him.  You don't give a fuck about these people.  But, you know, it's fine if you want to get ratings and do things.  But he does this under the guise of helping people.  Oh, sure.  Fuck off.  And that's, I don't have respect for people like that.  Yeah.  Now, again, I'm pop culture, very ignorant.  When you were on Dr. Phil, your parents were or both of you guys?  Um, my parents were with myself.  And Dr. Phil was acting like he was helping. 
[01:49:00]  But really, he just likes to make things work.  Stir it up.  He'll say things and put words in people's mouths as they're up there and make conflict.  He wants conflict.  And that's fine.  Whatever.  He needs to eat too.  Did you realize he was doing that when he was doing it?  Or is he?  Oh, I realized.  I quit talking to him.  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, why did I even come here if you gave me another impression?  It was really effed up.  Oh, that's fine.  Because it's like, you know, everyone's done something where we've filmed something with  a person.  Is that what it was about?  He was giving a shit about that? 
[01:49:30]  It was like, well.  Well, yeah.  But he was like saying, you shouldn't sell it and you shouldn't.  I'm, hell.  It's going to get out there anyway.  It's going to get out there anyway.  Exactly.  Am I going to give somebody a free show or am I going to make sure I take care of it legally  and get paid for it?  Right.  I mean, I think he's just an ignorant individual.  What's wrong with you selling it?  Like, what is he doing that's so important?  It's like he has his own issues from what I've heard from other radio shows and I don't  even look into people's personal lives.  I like to just show up, meet them and see what they're about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He definitely gave me a bad impression. 
[01:50:00]  But then every other radio show after that just tore his ass and he went because of his  personal life, his son, you know, dating Playboy stars and like all this other shit I didn't  know about.  So I really feel that I'm in the clear with that.  He's a douche.  I think people kind of really feel Dr. Phil's a douche.  There's just something about him that's truly hateable.  Yeah.  I mean, I think he's just a hateful person.  Why would you cause horrible things in other people's lives?  Yeah.  Well, it makes good TV.  It makes good TV for him.  And to make believe he's actually helping people. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just stop with it.  And he's not even a real doctor.  No, I know.  No.  But isn't that what it is?  We've been on his case for many years.  Trust me.  I'm Dr. Anthony.  He's very hateable.  I'm going to call myself Dr. Anthony.  Didn't he have to say with Britney Spears, like, well, I just counsel her.  Like, he had to come out and go, like, I'm not a real doctor.  I'm just counseling her, a family counsel.  Oh, the guy's a twat.  I'm so happy everybody hates him now.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  No one really likes him.  So are you happy with the way the film came out?  We only saw a little bit of it.  I mean, it's fantastic.  I don't know what Vivid has.  I just have my thing at home that I watch. 
[01:51:00]  But Howard was, like, telling me he was seeing different things that I've never heard before.  So I'm guessing there's a couple different cuts.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  So whatever you see, you see, okay?  It's a very well-rounded movie.  There's a lot of, you know, different types of sexual activity.  There's a lot of action.  There's a nice storyline going on.  Yeah, yeah.  I like your little playful banter.  It's pretty good.  You know, a lot of playful banter. 
[01:51:30]  Could have used a car chase, but, you know, it's okay.  Yeah, it was very sexy.  We could have watched the whole thing.  But it was very, it was very, it was quite good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks for the compliment.  You're very welcome.  There you go.  See, you're figuring it out.  Thank you.  Thanks for the compliment.  And your show, you can get this on vivid.com.  So go there and get this.  Because this has got so many hits in such a short period of time.  There's just, I think the fact that you probably didn't contract to have it done, people like.  People like kind of looking in on people's private lives. 
[01:52:00]  We like, I'm not saying it's right, but people are nosy.  And we like seeing shit we're not supposed to see.  Oh, we're all a bunch of busy bodies.  But if you had come out and said, hey, I'm signing up to do an adult film in two weeks,  it would have gotten hits, but probably not as many.  But the fact that you had to fight to get it, people think like, oh, we're seeing something  we're not supposed to see.  So you can go and check it out.  So what we've seen is fucking sexy.  Backdoor, teen mom.  Yeah, I wanted to stand and applaud when you walked in, but I figured that might be too much.  It's vivid.com.  And you can follow Farrah on F1, it's the number one, Abraham. 
[01:52:30]  So just think of Twitter.  And then you'll see all the appearances.  I'm going to be in New Jersey this week at Pashions and at 46 Lounge.  And then I'm going to head out to Vegas at Sapphire for a pool party.  Nice.  It's nice to be getting paid just to kind of hang out, right?  Yeah.  I enjoy meeting people.  I mean, I'm 22.  I'm single.  I like to go see what's out there.  Wait, one other thing.  The bikini from the scene was put on eBay and reached $14,700 before being pulled off 
[01:53:00]  the site?  I don't know.  I'm not in charge of the bikini.  Oh, man.  Why would they pull it off the site?  It's a bikini.  Because it probably was...  $15,000 somebody was willing to pay for the bikini from the scene.  Because I heard it wasn't washed.  Now the website Pornhub has it.  Oh, it wasn't washed?  Okay.  Oh, my God.  All right, cool.  People are fucking freaks.  It's not even washed.  Yeah.  That is kind of...  I know.  How gross is it that we all understand the offer now?  We're like, all right, I completely get it.  I completely get it.  Oh, now it makes sense.  All right.  I got it.  You spent $15,000 on that offer?  Yeah.  Wow.  I guess a piece of pop culture or something. 
[01:53:30]  Whatever.  It's very sexy.  I'll launder it the second I get it.  Yeah.  Yes.  And you're also promoting Raspberry Tones weight loss supplement.  For an effortlessly good body.  Yeah.  It really helps out when I travel and need to keep my appetite together.  Jimmy just tries to eat better.  Yeah.  Just go to the gym.  He has a little English accent sometimes.  Go to the gym.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you for having me.  Thank you, guys.  Very, very beautiful and very lovely.  Very sexy.  Yes.  Yeah.  See you again.  Very cool.  Thank you.  We should be right before Saturday.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Quick prayer.  Well, Seth's right outside.  Oh, Seth's out there.  You want to just tag team?  You want to do a tag team?  You just like, yeah.  Farrah, give Seth Rogen a high five on your way out.  Yeah.  Smack him and he'll come right in.  Yeah, because we got to kind of continue.  Yeah.  Continue.  He probably won't smell as good.  No.  No.  I bet.  No.  No.  Okay.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy loves the little picture.  Aw.  Hold on.  Did it turn out?  Oh, there we go.  Hey, Seth.  Seth.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Nice.  Thank you, guys.  Nice.  You know Farrah? 
[01:54:30]  I haven't seen your movie yet, but I'm excited to check it out.  See?  Take it easy.  Yeah, she has a movie, too, Sal.  I know.  Exactly.  More excited for hers than mine, I think.  Yes.  And it's something about her end.  I've heard.  Is she doing any butt in that?  Yes.  I so have heard.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  She does anal.  She dives right into it.  See, that's dumb, though, because she could have worked up to it and milked more money  out of the situation.  But she lost her anal virginity at 15.  Ooh.  Fuck.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Late over, right?  Is that evidence in the video?  You know?  That was just not even an option.  Like, when we were growing up, it was like, that wasn't a fucking option.  No, that's crazy.  You would be, yeah.  You heard myths of that.  Yes, it was mythical.  You're right.  It was a mythical thing.  I think I was 30.  I'm shocked that a T-mong had the first dick in your ass open.  There you go.  Oh, Jesus.  I like a good ass fuck. 
[01:55:30]  I believe 30-ish.  Around there.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Oh, it wasn't even an option.  No.  Okay.  You didn't even know how to ask for it.  They dive into it young these days.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I miss that.  Well, because they want to keep your virginity.  So there you be.  Okay.  That didn't work out too well either.  But in general, yeah.  He's not a butt baby, is he?  Teen mom butt baby edition would be a, I would watch that show.  A ratings juggernaut.  Exactly.  I got to tell you.  He reinvents the wheel. 
[01:56:00]  Well, that was nice having her in here.  She's sexy, man.  Well, yeah.  She was very attractive.  Yeah, yeah.  She's a very thin, long legs.  Is she a fake breast?  I think they are.  She got them augmented.  Augmented.  They use the word augmented these days.  All that sexy talk you have, Jimmy.  No, it says in the bio.  Oh, augmented.  Your tits are so augmented.  That's a gross word.  It is.  It's not sexy.  It's like you do to a machine.  Augmented my car.  Yeah, after Teen Mom, she had them augmented. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  It's not good for her.  Teen Mom money.  She didn't just say she got breast implants.  I like natural tits.  I don't know why women do that.  I don't need that.  Nothing's more sad than a porn star where you like gets fake breast.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  So you're into them already.  And then you're like, oh.  It should just be, yeah, regular fucking.  I don't care if they're small.  It doesn't matter.  Well, we've been lucky over the years.  We've seen so many.  And as soon as they take their shirt off, it's like, what the fuck?  It looks great in a sweater.  Every once in a while, you get one that's done right.  You're like, fuck, that's good. 
[01:57:00]  But they always go too big.  And the skin's too tight.  It's gross.  It doesn't move at all.  It's weird.  The scars.  They remove the nipples sometimes.  Put it back over here.  Over here now.  Sometimes they're both on one side.  They lose track.  Like a flounder.  We've seen it all, Seth.  Scars under the arm because they go under the arm.  They go under the arm.  Then we had a broad on that pumps up her own boobs.  No shit.  Yes.  She puts her own saline in depending on what she has to do.  Like Liberace's dick.  Yeah.  Yes.  Liberace. 
[01:57:30]  Did you see that movie?  I made it halfway through.  I didn't finish it.  No.  I will.  Not because of that.  It is hard to continue watching after you come.  Exactly.  I know.  I'll finish it later.  I like to keep it fresh.  We got what's-his-name coming in tomorrow, right?  Scott.  Scott Thorson.  Scott.  The actual guy?  Yeah.  The actual guy tomorrow.  I got to ask how big Liberace's cock was.  Who doesn't want to know that?  You got to know that.  Of course.  You're a journalist.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You think he had a hammer?  I don't know. 
[01:58:00]  Maybe because he wanted to fucking-  Did you see the movie?  I saw the first half.  But he talks about how-  What happened?  He has an augmentation.  Yes.  Why didn't you watch the second?  I actually just fell asleep.  Like it wasn't like a purposeful.  Like fuck this shit.  Seth blew a load and dozed off.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Just knock off your own mess.  I came and I did it.  I'll save the-  That was fucking amazing.  Yeah.  I'll save the other half for later.  Exactly.  Next weekend.  Yeah, I'd like that.  Michael Douglas was passed to win something.  The performances are un-fucking-believable.  Really good. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  He's unbelievable in it.  Matt Damon.  Rob Lowe's unbelievable.  Hilarious.  He's so fucking funny.  He's so funny.  What a creep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But of course we're here to talk about your movie.  Okay.  Sure.  This is the end.  I'll talk about Butt Babies more.  Yeah.  I saw this as the end, man.  Fuck, man.  I loved it.  Thank you so much, man.  Absolutely loved it.  I really appreciate that.  And I haven't loved a comedy in a while.  It's been a couple years now.  It's tough to make a good comedy.  Very tough to make a good comedy.  Why do you think it's tough?  I think it's tough to let them leave you alone, honestly. 
[01:59:00]  That's what I found is the most tough, is to resist money, honestly.  Like, you have to, like, make movies for, like, cheaper than you can make them for.  Yeah.  It's, like, what's a little counterintuitive.  Like, we probably could make more expensive movies, but we don't, because we get to make  fucking crazy movies if we make cheaper movies.  So, like, you literally get paid less.  You have less time to make them.  Like, and it's taken me years to realize that that's better, but it is better. 
[01:59:30]  And I think that's why we've found it hard.  Like, every movie we've made that isn't as good as the good or, you know, the better movies  we've made is because of the rating or the budget or just something that kind of ultimately  disqualifies it from being, like, batshit fucking crazy.  Right.  Which is what you want to be able to do, is, like, any idea you come up with on set, you  want to be like, let's do that, let's do that.  And you don't ever want to be like, ah, I don't think we can do that.  Right.  Well, with that said, there's so many cameos in this movie, and the one thing I was thinking 
[02:00:00]  as I'm sitting there, like, man, set's got to pay all these people.  We didn't pay any of them shit.  But how do you, I mean, how do you get them all to agree to do their cameos?  You call it a lot of favors.  And just say please.  Wow.  You just say please.  And you hope, you know, I do stuff that people ask me.  If I think it's funny, like, if you're, again, if, like, there's so few actually funny things  out there, that if there's something that you feel like might be funny, then you just  do it.  You want to do a vine with me? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's about the amount of time I commit to those things.  But I can only commit to the first two seconds.  I'll do the first cut of the vine.  But, yeah, I mean, it's just fun.  People want to do funny shit.  Like, it's fun for them as, you know, people who like to be funny to do funny shit.  Yeah, yeah.  So, it wasn't that hard to get people.  How do you explain the movie in your words there?  How do I explain the plot of the movie?  Yeah, yeah.  It's hard.  But we say, I guess it's about a bunch of famous people that are having a party at James 
[02:01:00]  Franco's house.  And then the apocalypse happens.  And a lot of them die.  And the survivors barricade themselves in the house and kind of have to deal with each  other's, like, underlying, like, issues with each other and, like, their past, their friendships  and their...  As they ride out the apocalypse.  As they ride out the end of the world.  When you pick up Jay at the airport and go back to your place, I'm like, alright, I'm  in.  Yeah, exactly.  That whole sequence, I'm like, okay, this is going to be a really fucking good movie.  Thank you.  And it's tough to talk about a movie I've seen that other people haven't seen. 
[02:01:30]  I haven't seen it.  You don't want to give away shit.  Yeah, it's true.  But one thing you'll like, and I actually thought about this as, we use war pigs in  the movie.  Oh, nice.  And we kind of, like, cut it in a, like, we kind of use it as score, almost.  Like, we use the riff, da-da, over and over again.  And in order to do that, Ozzy Osbourne had to clear it.  So he actually came himself with Sharon to our offices and watched the entire movie by  himself.  And he fucking loved it.  And he cleared us the song for the movie.  And also, over the end credits, there's a new Sabbath song from his new album. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, wow.  And it, like, literally kicks in, like, right when the movie ends.  Do you mean this album?  I do mean that album.  But what was great is we got to listen to the whole album, like, in December, because  we got to pick which song we wanted at the end.  And it was amazing.  That's fucking great.  It's so good.  Put it this way.  It's so good.  It's so good that it made Jimmy pop into a British accent when Ozzy was here yesterday.  He was here yesterday.  You talked to him in a British accent? 
[02:02:30]  Well, we got to play it for some reason.  Ozzy and Deezer came in yesterday.  And I don't know what happened.  I just...  Jimmy's such a fanboy.  He literally, like...  You know if you're hanging out with people long enough, you kind of take on some of their  speech patterns?  The first time I had a good friend from New York, I, like, couldn't help it.  You just start talking like this a little bit.  A little bit here and there.  Jimmy instantly became, like, British or Irish or Scottish.  We're not even sure what it was.  You became James Norton.  I became the other Jim Norton, the actor who's in the English. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  There's an old British Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was sitting here yesterday.  I have to confess, when Seth walked in, I laughed like him.  Did he?  Yes.  Go back to the tape later.  We are great like that.  I don't know why, but...  I've had people tell me that before, actually.  Because your laugh is...  Listen to...  Yeah, this is from yesterday.  It's a quick clip.  They're coming in to, you know, to be interviewed.  And the part where he talks about how he's losing weight, Ozzy goes, wow, you lost a lot  of weight.  And then Jim tells him how he's losing weight.  Listen to this put-on, fucking, douchey, British accent. 
[02:03:30]  Or you could just say, I'm just a boy talking to Ozzy.  Douche.  Ozzy Osbourne.  That's me.  How you doing, Ozzy?  That's you.  Take a seat, my friend.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, man?  Take a seat.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym.  He took the cadence. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  He took the cocky cadence.  He did.  And then...  Just go to the gym, love.  There's another one right after that, too, you've got to hear, because he does that.  Just go to the gym.  He goes, try to eat.  It's better.  It's better.  It's terrible.  Here it is.  Thank you.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just go to the gym.  Just go to the gym and eating better.  I'm so douche down by that.  But I do...  Thank God I came right back.  Did you bounce back?  Did you know it as it was happening?  Yeah, I felt something was wrong. 
[02:04:30]  Is it me?  Yeah.  I think I realized that I switched histories and continents.  I'm like, oh, you've just become another human.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  I just got caught up in it, because they're so British.  I do something almost equally embarrassing around musicians, which is, I'll start singing their songs without realizing it.  Oh, shit.  Like, and I do it a lot, like, and I always, it is super fucking embarrassing.  Like, if Ozzy was here, I would just start being like, and then I'd have to catch myself. 
[02:05:00]  I'm like, oh, shit, I'm fucking singing this asshole song.  And he'd be like, oh, I know that song.  Exactly.  He's like, yeah, great.  Oh, yeah, I wrote that fucking song.  Good for you.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  You know it.  What the fuck?  You know what people seem to really like when serious actors or actors that aren't really known for comedy are funny in a movie.  Yes, they do.  And cameos like that are fantastic.  It doesn't happen that often when you get a serious actor in there. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But every once in a while you have a James Franco or someone like that who actually can do both things.  And was everyone really cool with, like, goofing on themselves?  Or was there something that you wrote and they're like, dude, come on, man.  There was nothing, like, career-wise they wouldn't say.  Every once in a while we would hit a wall with people that we maybe wouldn't have hit if they weren't playing themselves.  We asked Jonah to say he would, like, suck God's dick if he liked it.  And he was like, I don't know if I was going to say that. 
[02:06:00]  And there was some crank, like, Mother Teresa's, like, a piece of shit line.  And he was like, I don't know if I want to do that.  He was like, I think when he's like, please don't make me say that.  Okay, fine.  No, it was great.  And he's only on for a little bit, I think people know by now, Michael Cera.  Oh, yeah.  How you spun that.  Yeah.  Because we've kind of made fun of him a little bit, how he's been playing the same guy a little bit.  He's a sweet guy.  Oh, he's always, yeah.  Oh, we love him.  But you fucking hit it out of the park with that.  Yeah, he was great. 
[02:06:30]  I can't believe he did it.  He plays, like, a coked out sexual...  Yeah, okay.  I didn't know what you wanted to say.  Yeah, no, yeah.  It's okay with some of the material.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Yeah.  And we wrote that, like, it's fucking nuts.  Like, we wrote it and we sent it to him and we were like, there's no way he'll do it.  And we literally got back an email just being like, okay.  And then we didn't have, like, one other conversation with him about it.  Yeah.  Whatever you need.  Yeah.  It's just like, whatever, you're like, you're getting your ass eaten in this scene.  Okay, whatever.  Nice to see.  He's in the bathroom. 
[02:07:00]  It's fantastic.  And he's doing Cocoa Rihanna.  Yeah.  It was pretty good to look at, man.  It's unbelievable.  That's fantastic.  And the other thing, when Danny McBride shows up in the movie, he's a fuck...  I said it.  He's a fucking pimp.  Yeah, he's unbelievable.  He's un-fucking-believable.  McBride's, like, the funniest guy ever.  Like, when he's on, there's nobody fucking funnier than that guy.  It's crazy.  Like, he kills all of us.  And he's so, like, ruthless.  Like, he really, like, he came to the set, like, he came to filming, like, a few weeks  after we'd been filming, and I just kept emailing him, being like, we're really going 
[02:07:30]  at each other pretty hard in here, so, like, we're in your game.  And he just, like, decimated everybody.  Like, it was that James Franklin didn't suck any dick.  He would just, like, call it, like, everyone was just like, holy shit, this is insane.  Did you guys have room to just improv?  Yeah, a lot of it was, yeah, we improvised a lot.  It seems like it.  Yeah, especially when you're ourselves, you want to, you know, like, really give the guys  freedom to...  And you hang out with each other, not on a regular basis, but that's kind of the group  of friends, really? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, I mean, like, I have, like, probably a closer group of friends that I see more regularly,  but people like Jay Barrett, Craig Robinson, I actually see a lot, McBride, I see a lot,  Franco, I see quite a bit.  Like, all these guys were, like, invited to or at my wedding, and, like, and I up there,  it's like, we're actually really good friends, so it's nice to work with them.  You got a name for your group of people?  Exactly, yeah.  Like, the Bratz Pack?  I'm so glad we don't have one of those comedy group names. 
[02:08:30]  Yes, please.  I call mine the Fighting Irish.  Yes, of course you do.  And then you sound Scottish when you do it.  The Pikes!  The Commitments.  The Commitments.  Nice.  Nice.  Ah, shit.  Very well received, the movie.  It's getting good reviews.  Which is ridiculous.  And for a cock.  There's a lot of giant cocks in the movie.  Might be the best-reviewed movie with giant cocks in it.  With giant cocks in it.  I think that's the tagline from Rolling Stone.  Exactly. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, that's cool.  The monsters are great.  The fucking special effects.  Thanks.  Yeah, no skipping on the CGI.  No, you got some zombie stuff in there.  You got a little of everything.  We got a little of everything.  I think you're going to do all right with this one, Seth.  I think it's going to do okay.  Yeah.  I mean, we made it pretty cheap.  We'll probably make back our whole budget before the weekend's over, honestly.  Nice.  How much did it cost?  It's a $31 million movie.  That's amazing.  That's fucking amazing.  Do you think that if you make it cheaper like that, that they look at it and go, like,  fuck, man. 
[02:09:30]  He's making fucking eight times.  You don't let him do what he wants because it's made cheap and makes so much.  Yeah, it's exactly what it is.  If you're in that range, you could have as many giant cocks in your face.  You could have Mike Sayre doing coke and having his ass eat and no one says shit.  No one's going to lie.  Perfect.  They let you go for it.  Leave him alone.  It's cheap.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's got some names in it.  We love it.  You just don't want to be their biggest problem.  No.  No.  And, like, that's all it is, is, like, don't be the studio's biggest fucking problem.  And, like, we've been the biggest problem.  And, like, you don't want to be the biggest problem. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You want to be, like, the other thing that they're not worried about.  Jesus Christ.  Way fucking better.  What movie was the big problem?  Green Hornet was their biggest problem.  Green Hornet was fucking superhero movies, right?  Yeah, those are always their biggest problems.  Those are the biggest problems.  No matter what studio you're at, whatever superhero movie they're making is their biggest problem.  All the fucking, all the brass got their fucking hands in it, right?  Yeah, and it's expensive and it's spitting out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we're the movie that we're just making and they're not worried about it.  What's going on in the corner?  Ah, it's just.  Don't worry.  No, the fucking, the villain costume. 
[02:10:30]  It's true.  That's exactly what it is.  Talk to the mailroom clerk.  He's got an idea about the boots.  Yeah, it's true.  And, like, as we were those guys, you see all other guys, like, being able to do whatever  the fuck they wanted.  Oh, and you're like, fuck.  God damn it.  We're absorbing all the attention.  It sucks.  You got anything you're working on now?  No, I don't.  Anything in the pipe?  Not you, Jimmy.  Yeah, we're about to make another, we're going to direct another movie with me and  James Franco about two journalists who try to assassinate Kim Jong-un while interviewing 
[02:11:00]  him.  Oh, interesting.  That's a good concept.  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  We were just talking about that, like, that whole assassinate using the guise of a journalist.  Yeah, well, that's how the idea came up, honestly.  It was, like, we were joking around about, like, how come they don't kill him?  And they were like, why don't we make a movie where they try to kill him?  And, yeah, so it's about, like, a guy, it's like, Franco plays, like, a Ryan Seacrest  type guy, and we find out that Kim Jong-un's, like, a fan of his, like, he's a fan of American 
[02:11:30]  bullshit.  And so we get an interview with him, and then the CIA asks us to assassinate him, like,  while we're there interviewing him, basically.  Yeah, we were talking to Mike Baker, who's an ex-CIA operative.  He was in here, we were talking about Osama bin Laden and whatnot, and some of the videos  of him back in the day.  And it's like, just fucking have a gun camera, something like that.  Yeah.  And he actually looked at me, he goes, oh, yeah, we never thought of that.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, yeah, who the fuck am I talking to?  What an asshole.  It's just Walter Cronkite said no. 
[02:12:00]  Are you fucking kidding me?  My old number for him.  You kill him.  Yeah.  Well, that's a great idea, and especially using the goofiness of Kim Jong-un.  Yeah, I know.  Has he agreed to do it?  He's agreed to do it, yeah.  And we're not paying him, but he's just a comedy fan, apparently.  Can get a canny on it, can't you?  Exactly.  God damn.  We're good with cameos.  How'd you like directing him?  I loved it.  It was really, it was actually really fun.  Like, we've written a lot of these movies, and then you don't get to be the one to execute 
[02:12:30]  them.  And they've often have turned out better than we probably would have done, but it's fun  to just be able to see it through and actually, like, do it how you picture it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's definitely the most fun part of the job.  Like, it's not harder than producing a movie, which is what we're used to doing.  Like, it's way fucking harder to get someone to give you $30 million than it is to  spend $30 million.  And that's what the director is doing, is spending all the money that other people are  getting.  Right.  So it's, like, actually really enjoyable. 
[02:13:00]  Like, it's kind of the least stressful part of making the movie.  Like, everything, like, it's sandwiched and shit.  Like, getting the movie ready sucks.  And then promoting, you know, making sure that the trailers are good, and the TV spots,  and the press, you know, making sure that it's good.  Like, all that stuff is a fucking pain in the ass.  Actually, making the movie is, like, by far the most fun part of the process.  And as far as directing, how did you, did you just jump into directing at some point?  Yeah.  And were you petrified?  That seems like a daunting task.  It does seem daunting, but I think what we slowly realized is what we had been doing 
[02:13:30]  was actually harder.  Like, producing the movies and making sure the director wasn't going off the fucking  rails and doing something crazy.  Like, that, that all, like, there was a point where we realized, like, this is less stressful  than not directing the movies in some way.  But I think, like, you probably need a lot of self-confidence, because you think you get  on set, and people are now like, all right, that's the guy.  Yeah.  He's the guy that's doing this.  And you're just sitting there going, oh my god, I'm the guy, and I don't have a fucking  clue. 
[02:14:00]  No, yeah, you have to.  It's true.  That would happen to everyone.  Every once in a while you'd look around, you'd be like, oh, I'm the one that has to move  this.  I'm the guy.  You have to clue this out.  No one else is going to do this.  Right, right, right.  Like, oh, I'm the one who has to say.  Why is this shit getting done?  Yeah, exactly.  Like, oh, everyone's waiting for me to tell them what to do.  Everyone's waiting for me to be like, why is anyone doing anything?  Oh, because I haven't fucking decided what we're doing yet.  But generally, yeah, you need to plan.  You plan a lot.  You just try to make sure that doesn't happen.  A good team helps.  Like, the first aid, you know, we have a good first aid who we work with. 
[02:14:30]  Like, that kind of stuff.  Like, your infrastructure is helpful in that situation.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I hear a lot of assistants help and a lot of, like, a DP, a good DP.  A good DP is very helpful.  We have this young guy, Brandon, who is awesome and, like, really, like, he's one of our good  friends now.  Like, it's good to have, like, guys like that around you.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I've seen some directors where it's like, they kind of look through the lens.  Yeah.  And then you don't even see them anymore.  No, it's true.  Like, everyone else kind of does everything.  Yeah, and we're always, like, writing, like, we're pitching jokes during the scenes and 
[02:15:00]  during the takes.  And, like, I think we do a much more active version.  Like, sometimes they literally just, like, say the same shit every time.  Right.  We never do that ever.  You know, we always try to get smart.  Push them to find crazier new shit.  Right.  That's got to be so important in a comedy.  Because I don't even know how comedies can be filmed like a regular movie where, you know,  all right, that's the 20th fucking take of this joke.  And you've got to still look like you're authentically, you know, it's funny.  And what's hard with this is, like, if someone improvised something funny, then you do have 
[02:15:30]  to do that.  Then you have to cover it from all the guys' angles.  Right, right.  And, like, make sure it's funny.  And it ends up, you do have to do it 20 times to make sure it's the best version.  But, like...  Was that ever funny?  Yeah, yeah.  It was you.  What the fuck are we doing?  Was that ever funny?  What the fuck?  But you've got to, like...  I genuinely think that, like, if we think it's funny, and we're, like, dying.  Like, if we think, like, this is, like, genuinely fucking funny, then it is almost, almost always  actually funny.  Yeah, yeah.  There's, like, it's very rare that we are, like, this is super fucking funny, and we're 
[02:16:00]  just totally wrong.  You're all missing the fucking mark there.  And it's, like...  And I think people can tell when you, like...  Like, when I was, like, when I watched South Park, which I love, like, I genuinely get a  sense that they think it's funny.  Right.  Which is one of my favorite parts of the show.  Like, you can tell...  It's one of the reasons your show is great.  Like, you can tell you guys actually laugh at each other.  And it's nice, you know?  And I think, like...  I think that actually comes across.  The South Park documentary was great, because you saw them kind of talking to each other,  working out a bit, and then getting on the mics in the studio, and laughing their fucking 
[02:16:30]  asses on it.  Yeah, and you can tell, like, I genuinely think you can tell, like, that the second they turn  off the microphones, they're laughing.  They're laughing, and that just, like, the most inane dick joke stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  And you really get a feel for who the people are.  It's really funny.  Somehow, I...  Like, you don't think that was happening on Caddyshack 2.  Exactly.  Jackie Gleason wasn't here.  I can't do another take, fellas.  Of Jackie Mason.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It should have been Jackie Gleason. 
[02:17:00]  Was that funny?  Yeah, it should have been.  In his state of the time.  Not one guy thought that was a bad idea.  Exactly.  Comedy sequels are tough.  Oh, we've never done one for a lot of reasons.  But that one wasn't even close.  No.  No.  It wasn't a comedy sequel, but you just made it into a drama and told nobody.  Right.  Yeah.  How disappointed everybody would be.  It's kind of a Caddyshack 2.  And Arthur went fucking serious.  Oh, Arthur 2 on the rocks.  Arthur 2 on the rocks. 
[02:17:30]  That was an idea.  Sister Act 2 might be the best comedy sequel.  Yeah, there you go.  That could work.  It might be the only one that is good.  It is.  You know what it is?  I guess you have to put the same gags in and stuff.  And people have seen it already.  They always do that in the comedy sequel.  Oh, people laughed at that, so let's do it again.  Yeah, but bigger.  Yeah, yeah.  Bigger.  Has there ever been a really big comedy sequel?  Not really.  That's a great question.  You know who did well?  Austin Powers.  I was going to say Austin Powers.  You know what?  One of those stupid...  The third one was on TV the other day, and I just put it on. 
[02:18:00]  I was actually like, this is pretty fucking funny.  There's some genuinely funny shit in this movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Austin Powers pulled it off, absolutely.  I think those types of movies, like I think Anchorman 2 will be funny.  I think movies with no emotional weight or reality whatsoever.  They're almost making fun of the concept of the fact that they are movies in and of themselves.  I think those airplane movies.  Airplane.  Those are genuinely funny, too.  Naked Guns are funny.  Yeah, the Naked Guns are funny.  Hangover kind of pulled it off with the Segwan.  The Segwan's crazy. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there was a drop-off, but it didn't suck.  It's hard to...  It's hard, though.  Something like that, definitely.  To capture the magic again.  Yes.  And I didn't see three yet.  I didn't see three.  No, I didn't either.  But we're not talking about that.  This is the end.  This is the end.  How is Barbara Streisand?  I mean, she's somebody that none of us ever get to kind of be around.  You spent a lot of time.  It was really cool, actually, to be around someone like that.  I mean, as someone who's like a fan of movies and shit like that, she just knew everyone.  Because I was in a car with her all fucking day, so I would just literally rack my brain 
[02:19:00]  to think of like, God, who could I ask her about?  And it was great.  And I would just wait to be like, you ever meet Elvis?  And she'd be like, oh, yeah, I met Elvis.  And she'd be like, 10 Elvis stories.  And I'd be like, you ever meet Peter Sellers?  And I'd be like, yeah.  She smoked weed with Peter Sellers, she told me.  She had a great story.  And she knew Marlon Brando she went on a road trip with across the fucking country.  She knew all these people and had amazing...  And she would tell me these stories for hours and hours and hours.  And she was cool?  Super cool.  Super cool.  She's been famous since she was like 16 years old. 
[02:19:30]  And she's been famous for like 50 years.  So it's like, you know, there's definitely some slight...  You know, removed from everyday reality things that are bound to...  I don't know if it's any more than any other Jewish lady who's around that age.  But she tries to...  She's very nice.  She goes out of her way to try to be nice to the crew.  And she would buy ice cream for the crew and shit like that.  She was nice.  I got to ask you something.  You spend a lot of time in a car with her and stuff. 
[02:20:00]  And I'm sure that takes a long time.  Yeah.  You can't just cut a gasser in front of Barbara Streisand.  No, you can't.  You can?  No, you cannot.  Oh, you cannot.  She would not be happy about it.  Right.  She would be vocally...  Were there any instances where you're like, oh, fuck, I really got it.  I gotta get the fuck out of this fucking thing.  Probably.  I imagine I did.  Yeah.  Once in a while.  Yeah.  I would try to get up and walk around.  Walk around.  I gotta stretch my legs.  You gotta walk around a little bit.  I'll be right back.  Yeah.  I stretch.  Spread it over like a 30-foot radius usually. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  It's the more real estate you're covering, the more diffused it.  I go to the crowd.  I don't avoid the crowd.  She probably wanted to fart in the car too, though.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  I wish she'd get out of here.  Barbara Streisand doesn't fart.  Did she ask you for any showbiz stories?  Uh, no.  I don't think, yeah.  She would ask what we do.  Like, she seemed kind of fascinated with, like, just kind of young people in general.  What do you do?  Do you watch TV?  You go to the internet?  I would actually, she's like, she watches movies. 
[02:21:00]  Like, I literally just watch, like, fucking Captain America at her house.  Like, she watches every movie that comes out every weekend.  How cool is that?  How cool is that?  Yeah.  Damn.  She's going over to Barbara Streisand's house and watching a movie.  It was very...  Captain America.  I know.  You ever see Nuts?  I like that.  Yeah.  It was great.  With Dreyfuss and Carl Malden.  That was a good one.  Funny girl.  She's great.  She's a talented lady.  Yeah.  This is the end.  It's in studio.  Today actually comes out.  It's in studios.  What?  It's in a theater.  That's what we always say across the pond. 
[02:21:30]  It's in studios.  It's in cinemas now.  Go to cinema.  It comes out 12 June in cinemas.  I think it's going to go well with the people who are in university.  That's a good thing.  Yeah.  Very good.  It's the end.  This is the end.  I heard it's fucking hilarious.  I'm so annoyed I haven't seen it.  I saw it, man.  I fucking laughed the whole fucking time.  It's actually very funny.  Very funny.  And the reaction at the end was great.  People were applauding and they just loved it.  There's a very good, almost a unanimously positive reaction. 
[02:22:00]  Any Hal Needham blooper reel at the end?  No, we didn't.  It's hard to resist doing it.  Because you just know, like, ah, people will love this.  This will play through the room.  Franco can't even fucking have a straight face.  Our editor is actually the one who was just like, no, I'm not fucking doing this.  He was like, we got a good ending.  This is fucking bullshit.  Let the people leave the fucking theater.  At least there's one person with integrity that works in the building.  He's like, I'm not fucking doing that. 
[02:22:30]  That's good.  I'm an editor with integrity.  It's true.  We were just talking the other day how it's awkward where you're leaving and then you have  to stop and just stand in your spot.  I know.  Oh, there's more.  And you're laughing your ass off.  But it's like, you don't know what to do.  Do I go back to my seat for a couple of minutes?  When you're slowly walking up the aisle with your head, turned around at the screen, bumping  into people.  Peter Sellers was livid that they did a blooper at the end of fucking B.  Really?  I could imagine it kind of, in a way, like,  undercuts the entire movie, you know?  And, like, I actually hate that fucking outtake. 
[02:23:00]  Like, it's super bizarre.  Was there only one?  I don't remember.  I know.  It's him trying to get through the speech of, like, and he told me to tell that honky  motherfucker.  He should, like, and he keeps laughing.  But, like, I think it's the same take.  Like, they show, like, it's like six attempts of him trying to get through the same thing.  And he was fucking furious at that.  I could totally see why.  I'd be like, at the end of fucking Forrest Gump, showing Tom Hanks, you're like,  life is all content, guys.  I can't, I can't.  It takes away from all of it.  He was like, you've just taken us on a magical fucking journey with a lovable idiot. 
[02:23:30]  Don't undercut it.  It's also like showing you making mistakes.  I bought into this lovable moron.  That's crazy.  It was like going to your mechanic and it's like, here's your fixed car, but here's what  happened.  Exactly.  He's banging his knuckles and fucking spills oil all over your interior.  He's cursing out the, he's yelling racial shit.  Your mother's a whore.  Now the blooper reel at the guy that made your sandwich. 
[02:24:00]  My scab fell in it.  Who directed me in there?  Hal Ashby.  It was Hal Ashby.  It was.  And he's one of the great directors, like, of all time.  No, but here's how phony I am.  I said it was Hal Ashby.  Like, that's what I had been thinking.  I wasn't.  You weren't thinking that?  It was big time Hal Ashby.  Yeah, I was completely, yeah, yeah.  No, I was going to say that, but I had no idea.  What's worse is when somebody says, like, who somebody was and they go, yeah, that was  fucking, you know, Mike Smith.  And you're like, Mike Smith, right, right.  And then they go, oh no, it was Matt, uh, and you're like, you already, you already 
[02:24:30]  made it like you knew Mike Smith.  It's so fucking embarrassing.  It's like, no, I know, I know, I'm that guy.  I was supporting you.  I was helping you out.  Don't get mad at me, because I lied.  That could have been embarrassing for you, but I didn't want to do that.  Right, exactly.  Oh, I'm going to use that tech next time I fuck that up.  It's a technicality.  I'm helping you, you fuck.  I got to ask you about Superbad.  I'm looking at your bio really fast.  At age 13? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, we started right here.  You co-wrote a rough draft at age 13 for Superbad?  Yeah, we started in high school.  And it shows.  It's fucking, it's a perfect adolescent kind of a, no, it's like we were virgins.  Like literally all we were thinking about was getting laid and like, uh, and if we would  never get fucking laid and we had fake, we got a fake ID around the time.  And like, even literally like when we were in high school, like the script was always  about like guys who wanted to get laid and girls asked them to buy liquor to get to a  party for them.  And it all, it literally always falls. 
[02:25:30]  I get all that, but writing it at 13 is what's amazing.  Well, we sat down to do it.  That is amazing.  That movie, by the way, is its decades version of like what Porky's was in the seventies and  Fast Times at Ridgemont High in the eighties.  It fucking defines a decade for that type of comedy.  It's, I love it.  It's weird, but I, I've worked with like younger people now as I, I used to always be like  the youngest guy in the movie and now I'm not, which is fucking terrible.  But now you work with the younger guys and yeah, it's like, they're like, I grew up watching 
[02:26:00]  that movie and you're like, fuck.  How old's that movie now?  Fuck.  It came out, uh, not, it's like seven years old, but I guess if you're like in your late  twenties, then, you know, you were like in college when it came out basically.  You haven't changed myself because I saw recently Freaks and Geeks and stuff.  And it's like, ah, he's still the same fucking guy.  I almost look better than I did then in some way.  Yeah, you had to kind of grow into yourself a bit.  It's less awkward now.  Smoke the weed.  Yeah, definitely.  Nice. 
[02:26:30]  For sure.  And it's so, it's great.  It's great.  It's fantastic.  Have you tried it?  It is fascinating too for people that don't know you and your people that you hang out  with to see you with people that you hang out with and you're in movies now.  It's like, hey, look, he's with James Franco in this.  They've known each other forever.  It's true.  This is like amazing.  I met Frank when I was 16 years old.  16?  Yeah, it's fucking crazy to think of that now.  What was he doing back then?  We did Freaks and Geeks together.  We were on the same TV show.  He was, uh, he was just a handsome, you know, handsome actor. 
[02:27:00]  But he wasn't in movies yet, right?  He was not in movies yet.  He was in, like, a teen movie.  But he was the same.  He painted, like, I have a painting hanging on my wall that James Franco gave me when I  was 16 years old.  Like, he's always been really into, like, that art stuff.  And, like, he would always be on set reading, like, a fucking, like, you know, like, Nietzsche  book.  And you'd be like, ah, this guy's full of shit.  And now, like, 15 years later, you're like, maybe he's not full of shit.  It took 15 years.  He's actually into that stuff.  That's a hell of a fucking gag for 15 years. 
[02:27:30]  He's really committed to this handsome, smart guy.  Like that fucking Chinese magician in the prestige.  Exactly.  He's living the part.  He's really doing it.  Well, we've got to get Seth out of here, unfortunately.  Yes, that's a lot of press today.  A lot of press.  A lot of press today.  Fucking thanks for coming in, man.  Thank you, guys.  I actually listen to the show all the time.  Really?  I actually listen to the show all the fucking time.  You know I'm a good actor, qualified to be in film.  Oh, Jimmy.  Stop.  That's me as an FBI agent. 
[02:28:00]  That's all you need.  You've got to cast a fresh-faced young kid.  Yeah.  If you're fucking redoing something, maybe in Dublin or fucking on the floor.  I hear they're doing a Trainspotting sequel.  So maybe you can get it.  Trainspotting Oliver Twist.  I'll play the baby on the ceiling in part two.  You're probably what it would look like now.  Oh, fucking Seth Rogen.  Rising the roll.  Thank you very much, guys.  Thanks so much, man. 
[02:28:30]  This is the Ed Opens today.  Wow.  Okay.  And Seth Rogen on Twitter.  Another one to follow on Twitter.  We'll be back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  He did ask if I want to pay for him. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, okay.  Good point, Travis.  I'm trying to go to the U.S. Open.  Yeah.  It's down in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  And I want to go.  And we have a golf channel at SiriusXM.  And I actually had to go to Baldy and ask for a favor.  Oh, boy.  He must have loved that.  Yeah, it was awkward.  Oh, look who's coming to me.  Oh, no.  It was awkward.  Well, no, Mr. Biggie Pants.  Well, no.  It was awkward. 
[02:29:30]  The only reason I went to Baldy, though, is because.  And I know calling him Baldy right now is not helping my chances.  This is an easy way for him to stick it right back to me.  Yeah.  But Steve Blatter had a daughter.  Yeah, yeah.  I got the email.  So I'm leaving him the fuck alone.  Sure.  I can't go congratulations on the birth of your daughter.  Oh, by the way.  Can I have.  That's pretty damn obvious. 
[02:30:00]  That's the reason why I'm saying congratulations is because I want to lead to the U.S. Open thing.  But it did cross my mind that maybe I could fucking pull that off.  And then I went, maybe I'll go to Baldy.  And Travis is like, there's no fucking way.  No way, huh?  No.  No way.  No.  We don't get free stuff anymore.  Yeah, he did ask if I want to pay for him.  And then he said, oh, never mind, never mind.  I mean, Anthony, you got a bill for your Yankee tickets, right?  Never paid it, but I did get a bill. 
[02:30:30]  But you got a bill.  I did get a bill.  I think I crumbled it up and threw it in the garbage right here.  Do you have an outstanding balance with serious things?  Yeah, I'm sure they'll hold it against me at some point.  Why does that fall into plug-ola?  No.  But it shouldn't be.  It shouldn't.  It shouldn't, because...  I mean, we used to get baseball tickets all the time.  Yeah, if I go to the U.S. Open, I'll have one goofy, dopey story to tell.  So, wouldn't that help?  I don't know.  He thinks it's work-related.  Yeah, it gives us material.  That's what it is.  Here's some tickets.  How great was Seth Rogen?  He's fucking...  He's so much fun to fucking have in here. 
[02:31:00]  He's amazing.  And he's like...  Dude, the guy's Hollywood.  He's an A-lister.  He's officially an A-lister.  Let's fucking be real here.  He's pretty much running comedy in Hollywood right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially after this movie.  You watch.  He's going to be running comedy in Hollywood.  Just call regular guy.  Officially.  Actually listens to the show, which gets me, like, thinking, oh, man.  He's really funny and shit.  And other days where I say something, he's like, meh.  Yawn.  There's probably a day I sucked.  Oh, and then he...  That would be every day! 
[02:31:30]  At least he admits it!  But he doesn't understand it's every day!  He's still delusional!  God damn.  Fucking Seth Rogen.  Nice!  Yeah.  I didn't suck on TV last night, motherfuckers. 
[02:32:00]  Oh!  I'll bring it up, because no one else is going to bring it up around here.  Winner, winner, chicken dinner.  That's right.  Yeah.  I had to sit on that for six months, and I won my episode with Russell Peters and Rodriguez.  What charity?  I went with a Sandy Relief charity for Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  Because charity begins at home.  Charity begins at home.  I never forgot my Long Island roots. 
[02:32:30]  You know, you remembered where you came from, Ope.  That's right.  You're giving back.  That reminds me.  I've got to write Bob to see if it's a write-off.  Ah.  No, not if it goes directly to the charity, I would think not.  It's not a write-off if you win a fucking thing.  It never intended for you.  It never goes through you.  You're not being taxed on it.  A write-off is only something the government's going to take taxes out of.  They're not going to take taxes out.  You know, they always ask for the charities.  Yeah, out of your pocket.  It was out of my pocket.  Would have been yours. 
[02:33:00]  No.  It's a technicality.  But it would have been his.  No, it wouldn't have been.  If he got paid.  But he didn't.  But he earned it.  But they didn't say if he earned it.  I earned that money.  Well, then I'm calling the charity.  I want to ask exactly what my $10,000 got.  You've got to set up your own charity, right?  And then when you do charitable things, you have it just kicked back to your own charity.  And then you fucking, you're siphoned some off.  I got a charity.  Yeah, what is it?  Helpful people.  What is that?  Helpful people?  Helpful people.  Oh, helpful people.  Is it spelled F-A-H?  F-A-H? 
[02:33:30]  Helpful people?  Don't just look at me like a tard.  Fucking chip.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it was good, man.  It actually came off really well.  And I watched yours, and I watched half of Russell's.  And I was at Bobby's.  And I realized, I'm like, fuck, man.  I got a lot of stuff to do today.  Oh, no worries.  I came home.  As long as you watch mine.  Yeah.  They put me front and center, man.  That was nice.  Yeah.  Because you know people are going to tune out as the show continues, right?  That's just natural. 
[02:34:00]  And they did a good job with the edit, but there was, well, so much stuff.  And you're like, ah, that's so frustrating.  I added an Obama's having an affair conspiracy, and it killed.  And then all of a sudden, after the first mark, they're like, we've got to pull that.  So I don't know if they made a phone call, because they were nervous, but they pulled  the Obama's having an affair conspiracy.  But it's obviously a fake show and everything.  So why?  Well, the other one was Osama bin Laden's still alive. 
[02:34:30]  I'm like, let's go all in.  Obama's having an affair.  It's a fucking fake.  It's a fucking prank.  And it killed.  It's disrespectful.  It killed the reaction.  Yeah.  But I'm happy with how it all came out.  I was shitting a brick in front of a live audience.  I don't like that.  Oh, yeah?  Were you?  Well, because they don't know me.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe I was known in that situation.  I wasn't.  Yeah.  They knew Russell Peters a little bit, and they really knew Paul Rodriguez.  He had that fucking crowd.  That's why I'm surprised they even won, because I would assume they just would vote for the 
[02:35:00]  guy they knew.  Was it a very Hispanic crowd?  It was a creepy crowd.  Watch your shoes right up.  Is it like those L.A. fucking shows that they just bring people in?  Yeah, they obviously were busting from fucking somewhere, man.  They hand out the tickets on Hollywood Boulevard and shit.  Yeah, it was a creepy crowd.  Whoa.  And when they announced me before the taping, it was polite.  I'm like, yeah, of course.  No one knows who the fuck I am.  Was there a smattering of applause or a titter of a... 
[02:35:30]  I would go with polite.  A polite?  Polite.  Oh, so polite applause.  Like, I guess we're supposed to know who he is.  Right, right.  So then that made it kind of awkward to stand there for, you know, I mean, the show's a  half hour, but we had to stand there for an hour and a half, two hours, probably.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah, because the host there got a lot of his lines fucking wrong.  Oh, he did?  A lot of takes?  He had a lot of takes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did the audience have to sit and watch all the actual shows? 
[02:36:00]  So they watched it, okay.  Yeah.  So then they warmed up to you after it was funny.  Oh, they were howling at my point.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I used howling.  Then they were laughing.  Oh, boo!  They were, yeah, the reaction was great.  I'm like, okay, that made me feel way better.  Yeah.  Way better.  And then Russell Peters, like, leaned over and said, you fucking won this thing, man.  It's so obvious.  Yeah.  I was like, really?  Like, then I started thinking, wait, I could possibly win.  But then I went back to the crowd, like, but they don't know him.  So they're not going to vote for me. 
[02:36:30]  But then I started thinking maybe the whole thing's set up.  Maybe, you know, TBS wants the best prank to win.  And I think they thought mine was the best, so they've got to make sure it wins.  That's the feeling I got.  Because I'm like, these people would probably vote for Paul Rodriguez.  They don't like taking chances.  I don't know.  That's my guess.  You know, maybe now that the show aired, I could ask some of the people I've been in contact with.  The chick was great.  The one that was on our side of Kirk Fox was great. 
[02:37:00]  And they made me feel very, very comfortable out there.  This guy?  That fucking...  Leonard?  Yeah, the homie.  Leonard, when we busted in and said, you know, who gets the last laugh, whatever, he fucking lost his mind.  Pissed.  Beyond pissed.  Stormed off.  Said, I ain't signing shit.  Where's my fucking money?  You played me.  He was pissed that he got played.  Yeah.  And it was scary because we filmed this thing in a weird building downtown L.A. 
[02:37:30]  It was dark.  It was like a seedy area.  The building itself was kind of creepy.  And the lighting, which you can't really...  It looks great on TV, but the lighting in the room was a little, you know, dimly lit.  And he lost his mind.  And I'm looking at everyone like, what the fuck?  He's going to start fucking throwing.  He stormed out and he was screaming and yelling.  And then these guys are professionals because they're the punked people.  They've been down this road.  They've talked with us, yeah.  Now what?  They're like, oh, he'll sign eventually.  I'm like, really?  Call him his signature or his brains will be on that paper. 
[02:38:00]  He wanted out immediately.  And he wanted his money because I guess they promised these guys, you know, a night's pay for the work.  Right.  And it was at least a half hour.  And then, like, someone comes running in and goes, anyone have any money?  I'm like, oh, fuck.  So I pull out my wallet.  I had a hundred.  I'm like, here.  And we actually collected money for the guy to make him, to calm him down.  Right on the spot.  And to have him sign because they desperately wanted him to sign because he was great.  And if he walked away without signing that paper, it would have been a real bummer for everybody because he killed it. 
[02:38:30]  You'd think they'd carry around like a grand with them just in case there's such an emergency.  How'd they get, there's a camera, though.  Huh?  Did he not see the camera?  No, those are all hidden cameras.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you can't tell.  Because, I mean, you get really involved with the whole thing.  And they wanted me to see the set and see if I could, you know, pick out anything because they were around it for so long.  And there was one mirror I was so worried about.  They're like, no, we're not even going to, like, shoot it in that area.  So don't worry about it. 
[02:39:00]  Why were you worried about it?  It looked like it was surveillance.  It was obvious that people could be on the other side of that.  Yeah.  So, but it was really just so the cameras could be behind the mirrors, I guess.  Yeah, it was fucking...  It was fun.  I liked it.  Bamboozled them.  They were bamboozled.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Thank you for all the positive tweets.  Oh, yeah.  That was very nice.  From friends and listeners. 
[02:39:30]  Leonard.  That's it, I guess.  That's all we got on that.  It's weird, though.  I flew out to L.A. twice for maybe, like...  I mean, my segment was six minutes, and I'm on camera maybe two.  I flew all the way to L.A. twice.  Twice.  Because the studio thing was a separate trip.  Jesus Christ.  That's fucking funny. 
[02:40:00]  Six.  Huh?  Twelve.  Twelve.  What?  What are we?  Twelve thousand miles.  Yeah, for what?  For fucking...  A couple minutes.  Two minutes of airtime.  A couple minutes where I'm actually on camera, yeah.  No wonder entertainment business is like, you know, just huge amounts of money that get thrown around.  It's a weird business.  Yeah.  You've got to rearrange your whole schedule to go out there.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not out there just for a day.  It's a couple days.  Then I come back, and they're like, oh, you've got to go back now.  Just for, like, a small little thing on a TV show.  Weird.  I thought... 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, that was Kirk.  Huh?  Yeah, Kirk was great.  He was great.  Yeah.  We were talking about Seth Rogen, how great he was, too.  And how he's a fan of the show.  Seth is legitimately one of my favorite people in movies.  He is fucking hilarious.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  He's hilarious in movies.  Fuck.  Absolutely.  He's such a natural.  I don't know much of Danny McBride's work, to be honest with you.  Danny McBride, I'm telling you.  They just have not found the right movie where he stars in yet.  I mean, where it's all his.  Right.  You know, he's been in some great movies, obviously. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  But there's a movie waiting for him where it's going to just completely push him forward.  When he shows up in This Is The End, I can't talk about it enough.  It's an amazing entrance.  Yeah.  And then he kills from that point on.  I'm going to see it.  You think, all right, you enter this movie way up here.  How the fuck are you going to sustain that?  And he does.  Yeah.  Because it's one of those classic entrances where you don't see him at first.  You see kind of the action, what he's doing, and then he's slowly paying up to him. 
[02:41:30]  Uh-huh.  I hope people like it as much as I did.  I really, really haven't liked a movie like this in a while.  Also, I got it.  What?  Are you moving on from Seth?  Well, it involves Seth.  Okay.  No, I was making sure we're on the same page.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, you're going there.  All right.  This is hysterical because I've taken a little bit of heat here of late because of our interns.  A lot of people didn't make it.  They got all these speculation and shit and whatnot, but I invited them to my party. 
[02:42:00]  They had a great time.  No one's speculating, by the way.  Everyone was cool.  No one's speculating.  What do you mean?  We know exactly why you invited them to your house.  No, it just made for a...  Because you didn't invite the third guy.  Well, I don't want to invite...  That's why no one's speculating.  I don't want to invite them.  See, if you wanted us to speculate, then you should have thrown the third guy in.  You made it a little too obvious.  I don't want him there.  I don't want him there.  You got a little lazy with your game.  I don't want him there.  Well, that's why we're not speculating. 
[02:42:30]  What's he going to do?  That's what I'm saying.  That's why we're not speculating.  No, they just...  You know what?  Because here's the honest truth about parties.  You kind of want girls just walking around.  You want the hot bitches.  You want girls walking around your party so that when other people are there, they're looking  and going, oh, he's got girls at his party.  Yeah, look, this guy knows a lot of kuda.  It's not just a dick fest kind of a thing.  It doesn't mean you have any intentions or anything.  You just want them at your party.  Yeah.  This guy gets more ass than a horse's saddle.  Oh, shit. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, what?  Fucking...  Who else's saddle would it be?  And the horse's saddle gets one ass.  That's all it gets.  Chip.  Holy shit, Chip.  This guy sees more pussies than a gynecologist.  Okay.  That's good.  It's fucking stellar.  So, yeah.  So, obviously the interns are being treated differently because I don't normally invite interns over 
[02:43:30]  to my house for parties.  They walk around here.  There's this vibrant energy that has been lacking from this place for years.  I've never seen interns come and go as much as they get to.  Yeah, yeah.  They just come in the studio whenever they want and not one person has said a word.  They're almost skipping down the halls.  It's a very spry step that they have.  Lots of bright colors that they wear when they come into work and dress very nicely. 
[02:44:00]  Not like the fucking, you know, every intern thinks it's either they're a hipster or from  fucking the 90s grunge scene.  So, so...  And they don't have that glassy, nervous, oh my god, don't throw anything at me.  Look in their eye.  Right.  Look in their eye.  The fear.  There's not fear in their face when they come in like the other interns.  No.  No.  That are probably fucking something up when they do come in.  Um, so, so we noticed it's not just me that is treating them a little differently than 
[02:44:30]  the other interns.  It seems everybody is.  Seems everybody is.  Because, uh, of course, Seth Rogen's in here.  He's a big star.  The guy is an A-lister in Hollywood.  Uh, we, there is always controversy as to who can even fucking talk to the guests when  they come in here.  Especially A-listers.  And, um, pictures? 
[02:45:00]  Out of the question!  You don't fucking, if you're an intern, you don't even ask if you can take a picture  because even asking is inappropriate.  Which I, I never agreed with that, by the way.  I could give a shit if the interns fucking...  I don't care.  Fuck them.  Let them earn it.  I never agreed with that.  I, I feel like it's, you know, they're not getting paid.  That should be a nice little perk.  Just to paint a picture of the environment.  Yeah.  So the third time Seth Rogen has been in, there are members of the staff that didn't have  photos with him yet.  Right. 
[02:45:30]  Until today.  Until today.  Like who?  Yeah, yeah.  Travis got a photo with him today.  Roland didn't have a photo with him.  Roland.  Wow.  Very, uh, very important.  Yeah.  Well, uh, when Seth was leaving, uh, we had to get up for some, some pictures.  Get some photos.  Too funny.  Go ahead.  Um, and, uh, well, the door flies open and two beautiful, uh, young ladies walk in.  Did they ask anyone?  Yes.  Oh, they did ask.  I believe so.  Oh, I thought they were running the place by now.  I'll tell you one thing.  Yeah.  It's pretty much, they might as well be. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, I'm surprised they asked.  But that goes to Ant's point that they got the...  Of course.  They okay.  Of course.  If they ask, it's not good.  No one's saying no to these girls.  No one is saying no to these girls for anything.  Yeah.  They can fuck it.  They have everyone wrapped around their finger.  They can do anything they want.  And they're not getting even the least bit of, of flack.  Never mind yelled at.  And I think, I don't think Sydney is as aware of it.  Of how much power they have.  Oh, yeah.  I think Jackie is.  Jackie knows.  She's becoming aware. 
[02:46:30]  Jackie knows.  She's becoming aware.  She's got that Rochester fucking attitude.  Yeah.  She knows.  Rochester attitude.  I don't know.  She's got the accent.  I figure she had some kind of attitude.  Oh, God.  There's no attitude up there.  Sale.  They're just a bunch of...  Where's Sale?  Sale.  Sale.  They're just a bunch of pigs up there.  Eating garbage plates.  And they moved to Buffalo and they're Buffalo Bettys.  Oof.  They never had a name for the fat ones in Rochester.  Fuck.  Anyway.  I was going to say something.  No, Rochester doesn't have an attitude, really.  That's why I like going up there.  Oh, good.  No attitudes for the most part. 
[02:47:00]  Well, they...  And then I hear that in the mornings, pre-game, when you guys are all down by the offices doing  what you do...  Well, there's two offices.  There's two offices.  There's the one where you and Travis...  Work.  Work.  Actually work.  And then there's like an intern's office, right?  Well, there's the office where Travis and I do everything that happens on the show.  And then there's the other office, which has Roland, Eric, Sayul, and the interns. 
[02:47:30]  Sayul.  And every morning, before and after the show, especially after the show, when everybody's  in there...  Sure.  I swear it's summer camp in there.  It's summer camp, right?  Travis and me are sitting in our office, which is next door to the summer camp office, going,  what's going on in there?  Because all it is is like giggles.  Oh.  And like people doing funny voices.  Oh, there's like...  There's fun.  Yeah.  Shenanigans.  Hijinks.  It's because we haven't had fucking girl interns in so long. 
[02:48:00]  We need more women.  When you said people coming in for interns, coming in to take photos with Seth Rogen,  you only said two interns.  Yes, two interns.  Okay, there's three interns here today.  He didn't ask.  We've never had it.  I liked a bit, but...  Oh, my God.  Interns are college-age kids, okay?  Yes.  We've never had an intern who's not a fan of Seth Rogen.  Of course.  Every college-age kid.  Everyone. 
[02:48:30]  What's his name?  Joe.  I don't know.  Taylor.  Tyler?  Tyler.  Who denied him a picture?  No.  Eric's the one that says it.  No.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  E-Rog's a little smitten, too, because he's not saying anything bad, either.  Brian, I gotta say, I loved a bit, but...  Would you have liked a picture with Seth Rogen?  I wouldn't have minded one.  Oh!  I would have enjoyed it.  No, but that's not a definite...  He's okay with not getting...  You didn't ask one. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, I'm fine with it.  You didn't ask one.  That's fine.  You're not a Seth Rogen fan?  No, no, I'm a Seth Rogen fan.  But if you...  Now, if you knew...  Wouldn't you want a picture with a celebrity?  Any celebrity?  Wouldn't that be cool?  If you knew all you needed to do was ask, would you have asked?  No, I knew I could have asked.  Did you not want to overstep your boundaries by asking?  I saw the line drawn...  See, that's it.  That's the difference.  I saw the line drawn by the party invitation, and I was like, so there's that line?  See, you set a precedent with this kid.  You gotta let him in, even though he doesn't have...  Well, we can't say what I'm going to say. 
[02:49:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I interject something here?  Sure.  He didn't want to overstep his boundaries, but his first week here, he was asking if he  had access to press passes so he could go to concerts and things like that by using  the SiriusXM name.  You gotta ask that.  That's what he asked.  I didn't ask for one specifically, and now you're making him feel bad about it, which  is going to make him not want to overstep his boundaries.  You're making him think, what have you done over here?  He said, well, can I just go up to places and tell him I work here to get passes?  I said, no, you can't do that.  You should have told him yes.  That would have been great.  Tommy, you should have said yes. 
[02:50:00]  That would have been the best.  Can I tell you something?  The code word is, let me in, asshole.  Go.  That doesn't even work for us.  No.  Oh, no?  No.  No.  I've been turned away by a million fucking times.  You know who it does work for?  Jackie and Sidney.  Probably.  They could walk out.  Hi, we work for a series.  Oh, come in.  What he's describing is the vibe of the actual intern experience.  Yes.  When I was an intern, I mean, there were wrestlers that came through here that I didn't ask for  pictures for because you just, you don't think to, you don't want to ask.  And you know what?  They probably would have said yes and let you.  Sure. 
[02:50:30]  But you know even asking is probably stepping over the line.  You're not here to take celebrity pictures.  Right.  You're here to intern, work for the show, learn, get some fucking credit.  Unless.  Unless.  A different precedent is set.  One of the dynamic bobsy twins.  How long do we have them for?  Oh, forever, I hope.  We're going to miss them.  Think of the poor next batch that has to come in.  Oh, God.  Oh, just a bunch of more stinky guys.  What's your name? 
[02:51:00]  Merle?  Where's intern Merle?  Just lumbering down the hallway.  I hope it's one of these, another one of these dumb fat kids.  Yeah, he's having a tongue goiter, Lance.  He'll be in later.  Oh, God.  What did you think when you saw the ladies getting their Seth Rogen photos?  I knew that was going to happen.  Oh, yeah.  That's typical Sidney and Jackie.  I was going to be right up their alley.  The colorful clothes, the hair is done, makeup is on.  Seth is happy to do it.  He sees two pretty girls in here.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Seth wasn't like, you know, oh, I'm busy, I got to go. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, boy.  Yep.  That's the line.  He's living the intern experience.  They're rock stars.  Yeah, they are.  And they deserve to be.  Of course.  Quite frankly.  Who's going to stop them, first of all?  All right.  We got what we needed.  Thanks.  Oh, come on.  Tyler's a good boy.  You want a picture with somebody, you ask for it.  We'll make sure it happens.  We'll do.  Yeah, please.  Unless it's Aussie.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Unless you put on a British accent or Irish or Scottish.  Would you like a photo?  What?  The other interns just get to hang out in here. 
[02:52:00]  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  We had to ask them a few questions.  We never say we're done with the interns, by the way.  When they come in to do something on the air, we never go like, all right, thank you.  It's like, let's keep talking.  And they'll keep sitting there.  You've never looked at one of those pretty blonde girls and said, all right, we got what  we needed out of your things.  Right, right.  Oh, look who's coming into the studio.  And they just come in.  Hi, ladies.  How you doing?  Hi, rock stars.  Pull up a chair.  Did you get your pictures with Seth Rogen?  We're just coming in and defend ourselves.  Oh, there's no defending yourselves.  Because it's not like we just walked up and we were like, all right, we're going to go 
[02:52:30]  take a picture.  We've been asking for a couple of days.  Made sure it was okay before we did any of that.  Of course.  See, my point being, and nothing against you girls.  My point being, even asking is over the line for the normal intern.  Yeah.  By the way, you girls look great today.  Oh, fantastic.  Yeah, thank you.  You know what's so good is seeing the different colors go down the hallway.  We're, we're, we're like colorblind here normally, but that's a wonderful, what color is that?  We're colorblind here as a blend. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, well.  Shade is right over there.  You're right.  Colorblind.  Jesus, man.  I mean, it might as well be a black and white photo of, uh, of this, but, uh, you know,  it's bright and stuff like that.  And unless E-Rod Frost's hair, we never see blonde hair.  That might've happened once.  So, uh, you know, uh, yeah.  Everybody's also just like in a better mood in here.  Shut up, Sam.  You let a joke out and you hear those like.  You shut up.  Oh, just the hearing the giggling and stuff. 
[02:53:30]  You're going to ruin it.  It's, I got to tell you ladies, you're going to ruin it.  It's a treat.  It's just a joy.  You two are a joy to have around.  It's been a pleasure.  It's too bad.  Oh, it's a joy to be around.  Say, isn't that great?  How long have you guys been here?  Uh, this is my second week.  Two weeks.  This is our third week, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They make us feel like they've been here the whole time.  Where we know them all.  I just love Sirius XM. 
[02:54:00]  I have no complaints with this place.  Remember that party?  God, it was years ago.  Oh, my God.  It's our second week.  Second week.  The Seth Rogen picture came out well.  You guys are happy with the results?  Yeah, I'm very excited.  He's already on Instagram.  Yeah, yeah.  Big fans, right?  Yes.  I defended the broads of Rochester.  Yes, I appreciate it.  Thank you.  No attitudes up there.  I mean, I do have a little sarcasm in mind, but I think that's just my fan.  You know, I didn't mean a bad attitude.  I just meant the attitude.  I could tell when you walk in that you're from somewhere else.  And they tend to dress a little frumpy, not you. 
[02:54:30]  What?  Oh, well, thank you.  No, no, but they do.  They're kind of frumpy up there.  You guys are very fashionable.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, sure.  She's taking on the look of New York City.  Yeah.  Well, maybe she would dress like that in Rochester.  Sal, how do you say Sal?  Sal.  Sal.  They get a little nasally up there.  Sydney tried to teach me the other day, and I kind of do it.  We had a coaching section in the summer camp office.  In the summer camp office.  It's a summer camp office.  And it's not like you're never in there. 
[02:55:00]  No, I hang out in there.  Of course you do, Sam.  I stopped by summer camp.  It's fun.  But we do, like, finger paints and, like, macaroni necklaces and everything.  Yeah, arts and crafts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are we doing an intern break?  Should we bring the other intern in?  We already talked to him.  What are you talking about?  He already had his time.  Right?  He already had his 45 seconds.  Yeah, yeah.  Sydney, I was reading your Twitter.  Uh-huh.  Because I follow...  Does he even have a Twitter?  How many intern's Twitters have you ever read? 
[02:55:30]  That's true.  Uh, when I was reading your Twitter, you had somebody with a rolling suitcase on Seventh  Day, honey?  Oh, my gosh.  They're all over the place.  Yeah.  All over the place.  And they just run over your feet.  And I wear flip-flops a lot, as you do.  Yes, you do.  And I hate them.  I hate their guys.  Yeah.  I was like, look at this.  She's already fallen into the whole New York City kind of attitude thing.  Well, I just naturally hate most people.  That's cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So...  I like that.  Why?  Where does that come from?  They're just annoying.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  A lot of them are not very smart, and they try...  I don't know.  I just don't like people a lot.  You know?  You fit in very well in New York, then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like, you know, posting pictures and stuff.  It's fantastic.  It's fantastic.  You guys don't mind posting photos while the show's on or anything?  That's all...  They can do whatever the fuck they want.  Do you remember when an intern...  If an intern snapped a picture...  Oh, God.  And fucking, like, posted a picture of the show during the show or anything, we... 
[02:56:30]  They'd probably get fired.  Yeah, you've lambasted interns on the air.  I have pounded interns on the air for doing that.  That said...  We haven't done that, though.  And it's cool, right?  The pictures are charming.  Yeah.  It helps promote the show.  It's good publicity for the show.  They're actually going above and beyond what they need to do.  The commentary is very fun and up.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I retweeted you the other day that your show was on, so...  Thank you very much. 
[02:57:00]  There you go.  Have you gotten some followers since, uh, interning?  Yeah, I'm up to, like, 800 now.  Wow.  I started at, like, two.  So just from this, I've gotten that side.  800 horny.  Well, you've got to be careful what you say.  They're, like, all nuts.  Because they are interns.  We can't go down that road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The guys are horny who follow.  That's acceptable.  It's true.  We've got to be careful.  We, uh...  We have to be, uh, uber aware.  Yeah, you don't see, like, has the workplace been a good environment for you girls?  It's not hostile or anything like that, right?  No fanny slapping or anything like that? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you know you're not uncomfortable when I come in wearing spandex with no underpants  and stand-up.  We never work.  Yeah.  And there is a little party going on in the, uh, in the office there.  A little, little fun.  Yeah, I guess we hang out a lot after the show.  Hang out.  It's mostly just Roland being ridiculous.  Yeah.  Well, that's true.  Roland doing the little kitten with the keys yesterday.  That's so funny.  Was, uh, just adorable.  Roland on his back.  He did a Vine video.  Yes.  And he's swatting at keys like he's a kitten.  I've been doing that for years. 
[02:58:00]  Have you been doing that for years?  You've been doing that?  Roland's a lot happier today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's good to have happy Roland back.  Everyone's a little happier.  Yes.  Of course.  For the past, what, week, two weeks, something like that?  Uh, girls, how long is your internship?  Till the end of August.  End of the summer.  Yes.  End of the summer.  End of the summer if you need it.  I don't have to go back to school.  Well, you know what?  I wouldn't be.  She's going to have a gig here by fucking, I'm going to tell you something.  September.  Yeah, it's going to be.  And it's going to be singing like fucking Danny Zuko in Greece at the end of summer. 
[02:58:30]  Summer loving.  Had me a blast.  I listened to that.  Oh, yeah.  I sounded terrible.  It was awful.  Oh, don't worry about it.  It was wonderful.  Did you guys sing this?  Well, we kind of were doing a little.  I literally had no idea you did that.  We did it on Friday.  I did not know that.  I was trying to get a practice for karaoke.  Where's the tape?  Why don't we bring this to the show?  It was on the show.  You left.  Yeah.  Oh, on Friday you guys did that.  Oh, I thought you meant at compound karaoke. 
[02:59:00]  You know who doesn't realize that he should be petrified?  Sal.  Sal.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's horrible news for Sal.  He's one foot in the grave, one on a skateboard.  Because he is the first one to go to make room for a girl that might need a job.  And you guys are way more qualified than him already.  You can watch Sal sail his fucking ass out of here.  Yeah, Sal.  That's what he's going to do.  He's going to sail out of here on the fucking. 
[02:59:30]  What's that date?  Sal fell.  Fucking Eastside Dave.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come on.  I've got to say hi to Davey.  Don't want.  No, you girls can stay.  Eastside Dave.  Get the fuck out of my car.  Scram.  You see the girls here?  Don't ruin it.  Don't ruin it.  Don't upset the ladies.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, girls.  No, I wanted to come to your party.  I don't know.  Davey, Mac, you were invited.  I know.  I know.  You were busy.  You were working.  It's always on a Saturday.  It's usually on a Saturday. 
[03:00:00]  Unfortunately, I work here.  Saturdays.  My last remaining job in radio.  Wait, what do you do here?  The Davey Mac sports program.  Yes.  I do it every Saturday.  Which, by the way, I rarely hear sports on that show.  It's going really well for people who aren't involved at SiriusXM in any kind of decision-making capability at all.  I've had meetings with, what did you call him?  Baldy?  Why are you talking about this guy?  Don't, listen.  I appreciate, I say, listen. 
[03:00:30]  I want to do some more things for this company.  I have this little fucking Sam Roberts doing every goddamn radio show.  You can't throw the Dave man a bone for Christ's sake.  Right, right, right.  Gary says, okay, do a demo for Faction, and do a straight demo.  Make it nice and straight.  I don't want any screwing around or anything like that.  Send it to Faction.  So I send it to, I give it to him, and I CC Rob Cross, and Rob Cross says, what the fuck is this?  There's no Eastside Dave in this. 
[03:01:00]  It's the most boring thing I've ever heard in my entire life.  Exactly.  Why would they make you hand it a tape that isn't you?  And then Gary replies and says, I don't do Faction.  I said for you to seek out the fucking music program directors at Sirius, and then email it to them blindly.  So I'm like emailing, I'm looking at people.  So I'm like, hey, Michelle.  Wait, so he can't even like, he can't even walk down the hall and go, this is one of our guys?  I know you don't know me, Grateful Dead Station.  But my name is Dave, and fuck it. 
[03:01:30]  I've only been here since 2005.  Your biggest mistake is having meetings with those guys, because they don't make any decisions.  It's true.  I mean with everybody.  I've met with Steve Blatter.  I've met with Rob Cross.  A lot of meetings.  A lot of meetings.  And I love them all very dearly.  Don't misconstruise this.  You can see it.  You can feel it.  They don't make any decisions, ever.  No.  Especially those two guys.  I just get the old runaround.  That's their whole job.  They just give you the runaround, hoping that you don't realize they can't make any decisions.  They literally can't for the company.  They're not allowed to. 
[03:02:00]  I can't say, hey, here's Metallica.  You're listening to the faction.  I need money.  They think it's like a fucking joke.  I fucking need the hundred dollars per voice track shift, or whatever the fuck they got.  I don't know what this guy is.  But they should let Dave be Dave.  You know, there's a million jock jocks.  If you want Dave, you want Dave to be funny and be you.  Jim, I will literally do whatever the fuck they want.  If they want me to be like, hey, everybody, you listening to me, hey, this is a great one from Fish.  Trey Anastasia really jammed our sacks off with that one. 
[03:02:30]  Like, I'll fucking do the jam station.  I will fucking, you know, shape myself.  How come I didn't get a picture with Seth Rogen?  Where the fuck is that guy?  Oh, man.  They did.  The ladies did.  Have you ever seen interns that have the run of the fucking place like these two?  It was really creepily that I just looked at them both.  You really did look creepily.  I stared like three inches away.  Well, let's see what you look like.  You were assessing them.  No, they're pretty girls.  So they were at the party?  Yes, yes.  But you know what?  I haven't invited interns ever over to my house. 
[03:03:00]  And I figured it was time to reach out to the staff like that.  And finally invite...  I don't know if that's legal.  We were wondering the same thing.  There's so many problems with that.  Fraternizing.  Fraternizing.  I plan to go to your house.  I would say any of your Sunday parties.  Because I take my one little dumb radio show seriously.  There are...  After the Saturday parties, there's usually a Sunday party that's much more relaxed, though.  I kind of like...  Don't worry.  I kind of like the Eastside day.  I'll heat things up.  At the Saturday. 
[03:03:30]  That's my specialty.  Yeah, but that's just it.  On Sunday, I don't want things heated up.  I'm exhausted.  The last time I was at an anti-party, it was me, him, and three 60-year-olds in a hot tub at 5 o'clock in the morning.  It was bad, yeah.  I had a blast, but I'm just saying, it was like...  We were eating breakfast in the pool.  Yeah.  It was fucking...  It's eggs in the skimmer.  It's terrible.  They still give you more shifts.  They won't give me a shift.  They won't...  I say this...  I gave up a while ago, because...  Why do they treat him like this?  We used to have some pull.  Why do they dick me in the ass?  You're a fucking guy. 
[03:04:00]  They dick everyone in the ass around here.  They're not spending money on anyone, and there's a whole bunch of middle management that just officially cannot make that decision.  I mean, I'm a big star.  You're the guy.  I was on True TV.  Right?  I was on True TV.  Yes, you were.  I saw that.  Doing a fart segment.  I saw it.  I saw it.  You know?  Fantastic.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Are you going to be coming to my special event on Tuesday at the stand?  What the fuck is this?  I texted you, and you texted me back, but maybe it was a Friday night, so we were both maybe  in a separate, a different zone.  That's true. 
[03:04:30]  That's true.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  You text me again.  It was a special event where I'm doing all my YouTube videos.  It's a whole night of Davey Mack videos.  Wow.  At the stand.  Right downtown, right?  I got confirmation that Bob Kelly's coming.  Wait, I don't understand.  Everyone's invited to this room, but if we see Jim and Opie checking their phones, don't  make eye contact.  What night is it?  Thursday?  Tuesday.  This Tuesday, June 18th.  Okay, I know I'm working.  No, I don't understand what you're doing.  You're just showing videos?  I'm showing all my videos.  The greatest hits.  I have like 600 videos on YouTube, but these are the 25 best. 
[03:05:00]  That's it.  I might say a two-second intro.  I'm going to drink with the people before and after, but that's it.  A little halftime.  Faye, thanks here, blah, blah, blah.  And then the ending, but it's going to be all...  You like the videos, Mr. C.  Oh, fucking love them.  Okay, so it's all those big screen and everything like that.  The stand.  You can find the link on my Twitter.  Okay, that sounds great.  I'll go.  Thank you.  What time will I let out?  Oh, Opie, it's going to be perfect for you.  Eight o'clock.  I expect it to go no more than 9.30.  Nice.  I'm in.  No more. 
[03:05:30]  Can you remind me?  Please stay for the whole thing.  If Opie leaves, there's three videos.  No, I won't leave.  And I will.  I'll check that shit out.  Can you remind me, though?  I have your thing on DVR.  Your episode.  Oh, thank you.  I'm not trying to be show busy, but...  It went well.  Davey Mack, also, I will be having another party very soon.  This week?  I just...  Well, I think Sunday's family stuff.  I don't know.  June 22nd?  But I will...  Well, I'm taking off because I'm seeing social distortion, but it's an early concert.  Let me leave it up to the ladies.  When are you girls free that you can come over maybe for a party? 
[03:06:00]  We'll work it out.  We're leaving it up to the girls.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Davey, you've been here since 2005.  Okay, ladies, when did you start?  Two weeks ago.  Not even.  Cool, cool.  Not even two weeks.  Little slut bags.  Well, jeez, David.  David.  Sigh.  Dave.  Dave.  Davey.  Now I see why they don't...  Davey.  Now I see why you're not on E Street Radio.  That's perfect.  See, that's smart.  That would be good.  I could do that.  I could do everything. 
[03:06:30]  Wait, let's hear your Eastside fucking deliveries.  For E Street Radio.  Yeah, E Street Radio Delivery, please.  Play a little...  You want to play Rosalita, please?  Rosalita?  Let's do it right.  Rosalita.  Get Rosalita.  All right.  Rosalita, studio album.  Studio album.  I mean, studio version.  Is E-Rock even at the board?  Uh-oh.  Yes, I'm looking for it.  I would have loved if he wasn't.  You want to go live with Rosalita, or what do you want to do?  Studio version of Rosalita.  Okay.  Let's see what...  You don't even have to give me the fucking... 
[03:07:00]  I'll hit the post.  You need the ramp time?  Let's see what E Street...  You need a hot clock?  Let's see what E Street is missing here.  This is your demo.  Fucking...  This is my demo right now.  Okay, good.  Well, you're listening to E Street Radio.  Hey, shout out to the big man, Clarence Clemens.  He's dead right now, baby.  But that's okay.  We got a lot going on here.  We got Bruce Breenstein.  Hey, I've met little Steven twice.  He's come on my sports show.  How about that?  Hey, everybody.  Eastside Danny Mac here.  Let's fucking suck each other alive. 
[03:07:30]  You didn't hit the post.  Well, he hit the pre-post.  You went pre-post there?  I went, yeah.  That's right.  So that people can enjoy it a little bit in the intro.  A little bit.  Yeah.  I didn't know that terminology even existed.  Pre-post.  I made it up.  That's what you make up when you miss the post.  You said pre-post.  Don't worry.  You said it was such conviction.  I believe it.  I fucking hit the pre-post, Rob Cross.  That's why my faction demo sucked.  Pre-post, another measure. 
[03:08:00]  Maybe mention the timer channel that the sports show you referred to is on.  Oh, no.  Not so much.  Anyway, can it?  Send that over to Bruce Breenstein.  Give that to little Steven.  Send it right to Bruce.  Not even here.  It's serious.  Little Steven did or had done a show twice.  The first time he intentionally came in.  The second time he was seeing Cousin Brucie.  And I literally dragged him in.  And he wouldn't even sit down.  He's like, I'm supposed to be doing a little Steven in about four or five minutes.  I really can't. 
[03:08:30]  I just kept asking him questions.  He's like, I'm really late for Cousin Brucie right now.  I'm really, really seriously late.  Anyway, my new show is on.  And where the fuck is still?  My new show is on Netflix.  Lily Hammer.  Yeah.  I love him.  I love him.  You know what's fucked up?  He kept saying this.  He kept saying, I'm coming here.  Is this a sports show?  Everyone keeps telling me I'm doing a sports show.  And it's like, this guy's talking about fucking.  This other guy's talking about fucking.  There's a fat guy over here.  There's a redhead guy with bloodshot eyes.  What kind of sports show is this?  What is this?  It's never sports. 
[03:09:00]  We had him on the show.  We had him on the show, I think, right before we saw Bruce over at the Apollo, was it?  Oh, which I tried to get several times ago.  You can throw David one ball.  He's been a Bruce.  Just one ticket.  How about half a ticket?  I'll stay out by the popcorn.  Or you get nothing.  Nothing.  Little Steven was in.  And we had a great time.  We're talking and everything.  And then at the show, we were kind of back in the, not backstage area, but like where  people eat and stuff. 
[03:09:30]  And I was back there.  And I was sitting at a table that apparently was reserved for the E Street Band.  And, uh, and I see little Steven walking up and I'm feeling all like, like, hey, Steven.  And I'm thinking it's going to be like, no, hang out, you know, hang out, you know, you  can eat with us and stuff like that.  Dick?  At his tables.  Reserved.  He said that?  Yeah.  And I'm like, I'm like.  That's surprising.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I was like. 
[03:10:00]  And then he just kind of turns around and the other guys are seated, like sitting.  And I just got my food and got up.  Well, yeah, they're not going to say anything.  Roy Bitton.  I wasn't the cool guy.  And Danny Federici, who might actually have been dead at that point, too.  I wasn't, um, the, um, the guy at the cool guy at the cool guy table at the cafeteria.  And that's why you have interns.  There's like a Freudian connection.  You have interns over your house.  Because of that rejection that you felt at one time.  No, because in a party atmosphere like that, having a couple of lovely girls over the 
[03:10:30]  house is a nice atmosphere.  I agree with you.  Don't they bring a certain energy to the station?  I would let, it would be fun to hang out with them, though.  Like I said, the last time, Big A had to drive me back to my car at six in the morning.  Oh, Big A.  I'm like, where's my life going?  Was Big A following your girls around like Puppy Dog?  No.  No?  Oh, good.  Yeah, he tends to do that sometimes with girls.  Like that, yeah.  Nice guy.  Mikey Cuffs was talking to you for a while, though.  Mikey Cuffs was a little taken. 
[03:11:00]  Sydney said that there was one creepy guy at the poker table that got her phone number.  Right!  I heard that on the after show.  How did they get your number?  Someone scored your number.  Yeah.  I felt bad saying no.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  In the same statement, she goes, no, I have a boyfriend, and he's got nothing to worry  about.  And then two sentences later, yeah, I gave, I don't know why, I just gave some guy my  phone number, and he's been talking to me.  I felt really so bad.  A boyfriend doesn't want to hear that.  No.  He's mad.  He is, right? 
[03:11:30]  He's mad.  What guy was it?  Huh?  What guy was it?  On my left.  What guy on your left?  I don't think I...  What do you look like?  I don't know.  Yeah.  What do you look like?  Yeah.  He wasn't the oldest dude at the table.  That would be rough.  Half a Hulk face.  She couldn't remember what she was.  Interesting.  Was the guy too old for you?  Probably.  It doesn't matter.  No, but I'm just saying, was he?  Yeah.  Every guy there was too old.  Oh, man.  She's fucking...  How old are you? 
[03:12:00]  How old?  I'm 20.  Yeah, you're 20.  Really?  You know.  Obviously.  I mean, I'm married.  I don't know what I said before.  Why does it always...  Why can't it just be people having a party and hanging out?  It's always gotta be, oh...  Is this...  It's not a big hook-up party.  What is this?  The fucking Playboy Mansion?  Drink the booze.  No, because the Playboy Mansion wouldn't have inflatable dinosaurs, but...  It's not inflatable.  It's made of fucking high-quality density resin.  And it's fucking...  It's very durable.  The blow-up ones are for babies. 
[03:12:30]  That was maybe my favorite Instagram of all time,  where I said his descent to madness is complete.  There's dinosaurs around the fucking pool.  Everyone loves it.  There was a line of people taking pictures.  By the dinosaur.  Oh, trust me.  I'm gonna get on that fucking...  I'm gonna fuck that dinosaur.  You gotta get another one.  You gotta add to the collection.  Some people have suggested if I get another one,  that I'm really crazy.  Like, one dinosaur is kind of quirky.  Two is batshit crazy.  You gotta have one in the sky.  Oh, can you get a pterodactyl? 
[03:13:00]  A pterodactyl?  What about some kind of, like, Star Wars creature or something like that, maybe?  Yeah, that could be.  I could have, like, one of those big fucking...  It makes it weird.  ...sand things come out.  It looks like I get shot down by Sidney, the fucking uppity intern over here.  Why I become Dennis Miller is another thing.  Hey, I'm just shot down by Sidney, Miss 14.  She was born in Karate Kid Part 3 or something.  Isn't that, um... 
[03:13:30]  What?  That's more like Sammy Davis Jr.  That was improv.  Yeah.  That was improv.  Poorly done.  That's why I'm the Davey Mac Movie Thon.  It'll just be the videos.  The videos will do the talking.  I won't be performing.  Davey Mac will shun the people and let the videos do his talking.  Yeah.  I tried stand-up.  I tried stand-up.  How'd that work out?  Well, I went in as the world's worst comedian.  Intentionally.  That's good.  Yeah.  It lowers the bar?  It lowered the bar.  People laughed.  I don't still know what happened. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, man.  I was a little bit tipsy when I did it.  I think I saw that.  That was at, uh...  The stand, the same place.  I saw a video of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At first, you were killing.  Bob Kelly said I did good.  He thought so highly of it.  He made fun of the Australian girl who he does on a podcast, saying she does it professionally.  I don't know.  Who was that?  Kelly.  Kelly.  Kelly.  For Stuka.  And then she got mad.  And said, hey, he had all his friends there.  And that's why he was...  Everything was put in his, you know.  I was like, oh.  Don't be a sourpuss.  I know. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Roland is.  We're just watching Roland nod off.  Roland's tired.  He's in the corner on the couch.  And his head is just going in circles.  He's nodding off.  Yeah.  Roland's a good Bruce Springsteen fan, too.  He's a huge Bruce Springsteen fan.  He loves Bruce.  We should do a trivia contest sometime.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you could do that.  Tape it.  And then send it to Bruce.  I think that would be good.  You get the gig.  There's two people you don't know talking about your band inaccurately.  You're not going to beat Roland. 
[03:15:00]  You don't think so?  Nope.  Roland is the foremost Bruce Springsteen aficionado.  Huh?  Maybe trivia facts.  Yeah?  You're not a good trivia guy?  No.  Aw.  I have the heart of a champion.  I'm a competitor.  So even if I don't know something.  How many shows have you been to?  With Bruce now, listen, he probably has me on this.  I've probably been to 12.  Oh, God.  He kills you.  He's been to a fucking...  He does that in a summer.  8,000.  He does that in a summer.  I don't have money.  How many, Roland?  Honestly, how many? 
[03:15:30]  Over 220.  Okay.  He does that in a summer.  How do you not go to that?  Now, my brother Mark has done 300 easy.  How is everything?  How are your children, Opie?  Look at my face.  I'm tired.  I know.  It's miserable, huh?  I'm tired.  I love it, though.  But I'm tired.  It's terrible.  Fred from Brooklyn.  It's not terrible.  I'm not saying that.  Let's be honest.  Let's be honest.  You and me.  I love it.  No one else in this room can relate.  No, I love it.  But it's a lot of work.  It's sad. 
[03:16:00]  If you're trying...  It takes every piece of life.  I'm not even going to say if you're doing it right.  If you're trying to do it right, it's tiring.  Yeah, I know.  But I'm trying to brainwash them.  Are you?  Yeah.  They're into Guns N' Roses and Indiana Jones in a huge way.  That's pretty cool.  That's good.  Except when your kids go to school and be like, I don't really like Nazis.  And they're like, why are they talking about Nazis so much?  Don't worry.  He said he doesn't like Nazis.  Me and Jimmy are out.  I got to take off?  I have to shoot promos. 
[03:16:30]  Can I go, too?  Every time it turns into the Ann and Interns show, we're out.  No, I got to go, too.  It's 10 o'clock.  I got to go.  I got to get out of here.  I got to fire out.  I'll go.  I think the show might be sold out.  Andy Socials, myself, Amy Schumer, Artie Lang, and Dave Attell, July 20th at the Sands Casino.  That might be sold out already.  I don't know if we're doing another one.  We're talking about it.  That's good, man.  And tomorrow we'll talk about Kenny's phone.  Yes.  Kenny.  And I'm doing my advice show tomorrow, not today. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, well, that's right.  That's the only reason why I'm here.  Sam invited me to do his show.  Oh, oh.  I mean, that's the other reason.  I love seeing you guys.  Oh, you're not doing...  Oh, you're actually...  I thought you were Ron and Fezz-ing it.  I am Ron and Fezz-ing it.  Okay.  All right.  I'm just going to be the whole thing.  He's adjusting the microphone while I'm trying to fucking talk here.  So you're going to be on this channel for the next three or four hours.  Easy.  I'm basically holding a gun to their head today.  That's a good drive home.  And saying you have to give me a shift.  You have to help me. 
[03:17:30]  Yes, please.  I'm psyched.  Good drive home.  Hi, Dave.  It's nice to see you.  Kenny, you texted me, but we did talk about your appearance on Inside Amy.  How come Dave's not talking about how hot his wife is?  Oh, shit.  It's uncomfortable.  That is uncomfortable, right?  She is a good-looking woman, Dave.  They text back and forth and Facebook back and forth.  It's just...  You have very beautiful children, too, from your beautiful wife.  Yeah, they're pretty hot.  They're pretty hot, too.  Yes, from your beautiful wife.  The wife is a looker.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  She got good titties.  Whoa.  Jesus.  Wow.  Now it did.  Absolutely a looker.  It did get uncomfortable.  Big titties.  It did.  Yeah.  I touch them sometimes.  Oh, God.  Kenny, but we talked about the big interview with Amy on Inside.  Inside Amy.  It was great.  It was terrific.  We're going to play it on our show tomorrow.  And I'm very happy.  I have to thank them that they Instagrammed a picture of me.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That's what you sent me.  But now I've got to figure out how to fucking...  Yeah.  I sent it to Eric, too. 
[03:18:30]  Maybe he can put it on the Opie and Anthony Facebook page.  I'm sure I'll do that for you.  Or link it to my Club Soda Kenny Facebook page.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  And we want to make sure everybody stays tuned for the very special guests on today's after  show.  Ooh.  Sidney and Jackie.  Oh, wow.  Sidney and Jackie.  Fucking real cocksucker.  Wow.  That's going to be big.  That's going to be a good one.  Fucking asshole.  That's going to be a good one.  A little piece of shit.  Beautiful after show today.  He's so mad.  It's just...  I am mad.  Oh, Dave will be there, too.  Dave will stick around. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, Davey Mack.  Davey Mack will be there.  Don't worry about it.  All right, everybody.  You too, Jim.  What a fun day this has been.  I love you, Jim.  And we'll stay tuned for the after show with Sam Roberts and Davey Mack.  And I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Rana Fez.  Jackie and Sidney.  I don't like Sidney and Jackie.  We love you and also know we can't do anything for you.  That's terrible, isn't it?  That's fun.  You can come to my movie-thon June 18th at the stand.  Could you get me a job here for old times' sake?  Sorry.  Can't do it.  We certainly tried, Dave.  No, can't do it, Sally. 
[03:19:30]  We certainly tried.  Thank you.  I know you do.  But I know now we can't do anything for you.  Or anyone else.  Or anyone else around here.  I'm trying to just talk to them and reason with them.  That's what I'm trying.  That's my strategy.  They're idiots.  If I just keep seeing them over and over again, they say, oh, maybe something will click.  You know how, like, if sometimes in the old days where you would pester a girl, pester a girl,  then finally she would go out with you?  That's what I'm trying to do.  That's my new strategy.  They're just idiots.  Do you think they like you more or less now?  Less.  So far. 
[03:20:00]  Hope he's leaving.  Walking out.  He's leaving?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How does this work?  Is this now the after show?  This is now.  It's so confusing.  It's in an instant.  It melds over.  It instantly.  I can't wait for the episode on TBS, Hopey.  Instantly.  I have a DVR, Sam, so it still gets the ratings.  What are you doing back there?  It was the NBA funnels.  I didn't know you were in New York City.  Oh, I thought you were going to work the board.  I am, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I've seen you work the board, EROC's board.  You got in the truck or you stay? 
[03:20:30]  Oh, I'm getting the truck.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get the hell out of here.  All right.  I don't expect Anthony to stay here.  Yeah, yeah.  Here, keep your computer open.  I'll take care of it.  Don't worry.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  That would be fantastic.  Great.  Hey, you have a PayPal account?  Just out of curiosity.  I'll just leave it open for you, Dave.  Whatever you need.  Give me a list of your five favorite passwords.  Yeah, okay.  Well, I guess the after show, do you take a break here?  Do you take a break?  What the fuck, Sam?  This is weird.  Yeah, we take a break.  Because usually when I get in my truck, you just started talking. 
[03:21:00]  So I miss the commercial things.  And I get right to the meat and potatoes.  So let's take a break.  And then the Sam Roberts.  You know, can I just say briefly to interrupt Sam here?  Sure, sure.  Give credit to Ron Bennington, who had, I think, this idea years ago.  Sam and Dave could do the in the middle between O&A and Ron Fez.  And they just said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And then somehow, after I left, they then said, well, Sam, how about you do an in the middle 
[03:21:30]  kind of a bridge type of show?  I go, okay.  That was the idea.  Once again, the big black dick goes right into my bummy.  You got fucked.  Right into my bummy.  Again.  I don't care.  Whoa.  She's touching upon Jackie.  Say she doesn't care.  Jackie hits the fucking sound machine by mistake.  And it was perfect.  Did you also notice what happened?  I had my chair out, right?  Jackie walked behind me and kicked the chair.  Now, over the years, what has happened when someone walks by and recklessly kicks my chair? 
[03:22:00]  Lambasties.  I lose my mind.  You know what's great?  I lose my fucking mind.  I went like this.  She kicked my chair.  I turned around and went, oh, sorry.  I apologized and pulled my chair in.  We tell the interns, don't clean up the studio until Opie, Anthony, and Jim are gone.  They're just not listening to you.  They're not even waiting until the show's over.  We don't have to.  She's not listening to you now as you're telling her.  She's putting things in files.  As you're telling her, she's still touching the 360. 
[03:22:30]  By the way, Big A just texted me, fuck you.  You begged me for a ride to the city.  So now he's mad.  So now I have to smooth that over.  So that's the problem with my life.  I get on the air and 30 seconds later, everyone's mad.  These interns.  Look at that.  Oh.  You realize if you were an adorable girl, you'd be fine, right?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, are we holding on to this?  He's not.  No, I think we should hold on and then just keep going.  So Samuel, I think we can take a break here. 
[03:23:00]  No, fuck the breaks.  I'm fine.  Actually, you know what?  I'll probably...  Do you do it from here?  Do you do it from...  No, I do it from over there.  From the Opie chair?  After the break.  Walk over there.  I'll fucking...  I'll stall time for you.  Okay.  Actually, you know what we could do to stall time?  What?  Talk to me.  The After Show will be here in a minute.  Oh, that's just a thing.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next. 
[03:23:30]  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You can only hear it on one headphone.  There it is.  Sounds good, baby.  Hang on, I got you.  People don't...  Eric, I told you to play this music for Dave's walk-on.  And he just said, are you going to play it now?  Eric just does whatever any person tells him to do. 
[03:24:00]  Like, you don't have to have any...  What's wrong with that?  Like, whatever just a human being tells Eric to do.  Just do it.  Okay.  This sounds great, though.  Yeah.  This sounds great.  The After Opie and Anthony Live.  Because the After ONA, do you have a theme song for the regular After ONA?  Yeah, we've been doing it for two years.  What?  It's been the same song every day.  And what is it?  Is that some metal song?  Some shitty Nickelback song.  Oh, God.  I've been trying to figure out a new theme forever.  God damn.  Finally get the headphones working.  Listen, Eastside Dave is here.  Oh, thanks.  A lot of people... 
[03:24:30]  I'm playing for myself.  May not realize...  I love it.  Yeah.  Well, if you hadn't said I'm clapping for myself, they would have just thought somebody  in the room was doing it.  Eastside Dave's here.  Well, now you intro'd yourself.  Well, thank you, Eric, for that round of applause.  A lot of people don't realize this.  Eastside Dave and me used to do a show Saturday nights.  They don't.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  That's right.  Three years.  Of course they don't.  I mean, it was a while back.  And even when it was on, it was on Saturday nights.  When it was on, most people didn't know we were doing it. 
[03:25:00]  When it was on, it was on, baby.  All right, good.  You know what I mean?  I'm glad you phrased it that way.  We used to do a show called Special Delivery every Saturday night here.  Now, Eastside Dave in that time slot does the Davey Mac Sports Program here on the Opie  and Anthony channel, which I hear is on fire.  Well, it's what's being called the most successful show in radio history right now.  By?  By my mom.  Your mom, Beanie.  And my four-year-old son, Stanley.  Oh, well, that's good.  You know, it's all those words and everything.  But, I mean, yeah, we are on fire. 
[03:25:30]  You are?  Oh, yeah, because we smoke cigarettes and put lighter fluid all over, yeah.  You set yourselves on fire, like Richard Pryor.  We're killing it on Saturday nights.  And we had you in one Saturday night.  Yeah, but that was, like, probably five months ago.  It was?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a while back.  It wasn't anything.  But you have had big guests on recently.  You had Michelle Beadle on.  Michelle Beadle.  I was thinking more sports-related guests.  Yeah, right.  This is what I never understood about you.  You also had the guy from Deadspin on, right?  Drew McGarry.  How is he?  He's very good. 
[03:26:00]  But I will say he's very much a writer in that he can't, like, look you in the eye very well.  And then when I was talking to him, he would put on this weird, confused face.  Like, so every time I was speaking to him, he looked confused.  Why am I being asked questions?  Right.  So I thought, like, I was not, like, speaking clearly.  Yeah.  So I started talking like a, sort of like a retarded person.  Like, I was like, so, you know, I was all excited to talk to him. 
[03:26:30]  He has this new book out.  And I'm like, I really like the passage where your wife is pregnant, but you want to go to an Oasis concert.  And he was just staring at me.  And I'm like, this is your book.  How did you know that?  This is your life.  That did happen to me.  How did you know that?  So I had to, like, slow it down.  I'm like, remember when you went to the Oasis concert?  On page 32, paragraph 1.  And I'm not saying, he's a very intelligent guy, but it's just, he's very much a writer.  You can tell.  Right.  He's just, he's much better on paper.  Did you ask him why over at Deadspin they've decided to take the Lonely Virgil concept that I brought to the internet? 
[03:27:00]  Okay.  And decide it's their deal?  No.  What's the Lonely Virgil concept?  Explain.  Have you seen on Deadspin that they do Virgil bag?  No.  Do you go to Deadspin?  I have.  Well, you're really kind of a fraud as a sports guy.  For Drew McGarrett, I am, fuck it, what are you joking?  I am Mr. Sports.  Okay, okay.  It's just that Deadspin, I like Drew McGarrett.  I like what I like.  Yeah.  I'm not going to go to fucking Virgil.  I don't care about black wrestlers from the 80s. 
[03:27:30]  I got you.  So you're picking and choosing your Deadspin articles.  I'm going to go for the sports.  Again, no offense, Sam, but it's wrestling.  It's silliness.  Sure, sure.  Except one thing that I saw, which is they've been taking the Jim Ross call.  That's great.  For when Mick Foley got thrown off the cage by the Undertaker, and they've been putting  it on sports things.  So when guys get dunked on, and the other day when LeBron blocked Splitter from the Spurs'  shot, they had to, oh, he killed him!  That God is my witness! 
[03:28:00]  He is broken in half!  That was awesome.  But what they did was, I started, and I brought it to the Opie and Anthony show first,  noticing that Virgil, who used to come to the, the black guy, who used to come to the  ring with the Million Dollar Man.  Yeah, I remember who Virgil was.  That he now, he just shows up at autograph signings, wrestling autograph signings.  I can't believe we haven't done a show in three years.  Right.  Within two minutes, we're going into wrestling.  With this note, we're going into Deadspin.  Okay, okay.  He started showing up at autograph signings and just hustling people for money.  He did. 
[03:28:30]  But nobody lines up to meet Virgil.  No.  So there's all these photos of Virgil by himself.  And everybody else is at these conventions.  The conventions are very well populated.  Nobody's at his table.  And you've, okay.  So I started a thing called LonelyVirgil.net.  Oh!  And I just post photos of Virgil alone.  What the fuck?  So, didn't you, what did you...  Well, then Deadspin found it.  And they linked to that blog, right?  So then, why aren't you happy?  You're getting the traffic, right?  And I go, this is great.  But then they started doing a whole series of LonelyVirgil things exactly like the blog, 
[03:29:00]  except they stopped linking to the blog altogether.  Oh!  And just say, no, this is our deal now.  Why aren't you telling me?  It would have brought it up to Drew McGarry.  It would have been like, hey, look, weirdo.  Yeah!  Who can't look at me while I'm talking to him on SiriusXM?  First of all, Asperger's eye contact up here.  Let's focus here, McGarry.  Yeah.  Why have you been fucking Sam Roberts in the ass?  I would have loved to find out the answer to that question.  That's how I ask people questions, too.  I just say, why are you fucking Sam in the ass?  Why are you fucking filling the name here in the ass? 
[03:29:30]  It's just easier than having to think of original words and statements and whatnot.  Ideas.  Being articulate.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I like saying that.  It's a lot easier.  The question I have for you is you've been doing the Davey Mac.  I'm so excited.  It's been three years since we did special delivery?  Is that right?  Well, in October it'll be five years of doing my own shows on Saturday.  Three with Sam and Dave, and then it'll be two with Davey Mac Sports Program.  Since we did Sam and Dave.  Now, the question is, you've been doing two years worth of sports shows. 
[03:30:00]  Fucking A.  I don't understand why after...  Three on the online.  Right, with the podcast.  Yeah.  Which is at riotcast.com.  That's right.  I don't understand, with all this stuff, and you're pushing, you're like, I want a career  in broadcasting.  I'll take any job.  Well, I technically have a career.  Would you call it that?  Well, you'd call it a job.  I'm on Saturday, I'm a professional radio, I can say I'm getting paid.  But my question is, why wouldn't you try to come in and just focus on sports and less 
[03:30:30]  jizz, and that way you could send out the tapes?  Oh, you're just repeating what the fucking Rob Cross would say.  Is that what he would say?  Yes, that's not what we do.  Okay, I'm sorry on the Opie and Anthony channel that a show does fucking comedy.  Who wants a Chris Maddux, who I love and admire, but who wants on this particular channel to  hear an X's and O's breakdown of sports?  If you think that I couldn't fucking break down why the Miami Heat lost by 36 points last 
[03:31:00]  night, you're wrong.  I could.  I could talk to you about LeBron James being tentative and being  his own head.  I could talk to you about the pick and roll game that Tony Parker and fucking Tim Duncan  do.  Do people want to hear that on this channel?  Fuck no.  Yeah, but here's the question.  You want to, this channel, what are they giving you?  Black dicks in the ass, correct?  For the most part.  Not this channel, I won't say that.  I love this channel, the people on this channel. 
[03:31:30]  Some of, maybe, the people who run this channel give me the black dicks.  Opie Anthony, Ron and Fess.  Of course, these guys.  I mean, Ron and Bennington.  He's not, he's the best.  No, I meant the people running the channel.  The bosses.  Yes.  Well, you've got to be more specific, son.  You're right.  I don't want to put words in your mouth.  The boss is running the channel.  That's more of the black dicks.  And I'm not even going to say all the bosses.  I have one, at least, who I feel a companionship with.  I'm not going to say who it is.  It's cross, I think.  It might be.  It's cross.  It might be.  But, because he's the one who will talk to you. 
[03:32:00]  One will definitely talk to me.  My question is, don't you think, if you came on here and just did a straight sports show,  even though...  I don't think people would enjoy it.  Even though it wouldn't be as much to this audience's liking, per se,  that you could then send those tapes out to other channels, other stations.  I do.  See, this is an extreme channel, for starters.  Is that what the X stands for?  It's an XL channel.  I didn't realize.  Is it, do they have a listing? 
[03:32:30]  Extreme channels?  Yeah.  Okay.  Secondly, we do an iTunes show, which got a fucking award.  Did your fucking show get an award?  Ours was named Best of 2012 by iTunes.  I'm not criticizing your show.  Hold on.  But do you talk about the jizz on the iTunes show, too?  Not as much.  Okay.  And, and, we just, you can find clips, but we tend to take them, yes, from the iTunes show.  Or Pepper has taken clips from this show, where we have talked a lot about sports.  Obviously, you haven't listened.  And, and, in the last three, four, five weeks, or even months. 
[03:33:00]  Why have you?  Because two shows ago, Pepper sent the whole entire show to the sports people, because there  was so much sports talk in it.  The last show I listened to was, you had the Quertos in studio.  That was a phenomenal show.  And you kept moving off the mic to perform songs.  And you did live music.  We performed six fucking songs by Quertos.  In two hours.  It was phenomenal.  But let me just say this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's the thing.  You know, the, the, what we did on that, on that time slot on Saturday was a Sam and Dave 
[03:33:30]  show.  It was a pop culture.  Correct.  Regular show.  How about you say it was a regular, pretty much.  It was a guys' talk show.  Talk show, guys' comedy show.  So it was, it would have been way too much of a, you know, like a shock to people who  are fans of that, and fans of this channel, to all of a sudden be like, you know, LeBron  James is averaging 15.6 points per game in this NBA Finals, as opposed to his 26.6 points  per game in the regular postseason, which are his fucking averages.  I know my sports. 
[03:34:00]  My thing is, people don't want to hit it.  So you got to, you got to do what people want to fucking do.  Yeah, I just worry.  Jesus Christ, they come on this fucking show.  I know it's going to be a crossfire, for Christ's sakes, Eric.  I worry, Eastside Dave, because you know I care about you, don't you?  I know it's going to be a crossfire.  I hope he says you're, you're great, and the fucking guy I do a show with says, what  the fuck are you doing?  We don't do a show together.  I worry.  We do, right now.  What you don't know is Rob Cross said to me, you're, from now on, it's the Dave and  Sam show every day at 10 o'clock. 
[03:34:30]  Sam and Dave, or?  It's the pre, it's the pre-Ron Fett show, Sam and Dave show.  The bridge show.  No, it's finally happening.  And they just told that to me.  Okay.  Let me go to George in Tennessee.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  We'll still call it After Opie and Anthony Live for now.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't know.  What's up, George?  Yeah, I wanted to let you know, Sam, on that Deadspin issue, you can copyright your Lonely  Virgil page. 
[03:35:00]  And if you do that, they don't have any...  He didn't.  He made a mistake.  Redneck.  Why would you...  Thank you, George, for the advice.  I don't know why you would have to take...  He was taking him so slow.  Yeah, but you don't have to insult him.  To get his point.  You can do what you can do.  Like, oh, please, just say that already.  Have you heard about what's going on with Black Sabbath?  Fucking A.  They're back together.  You're a Black Sabbath fan, right?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, you are.  Well, Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, and Geezer Butler make up one of the greatest heavy metal 
[03:35:30]  bands of all time.  Black Sabbath.  That's correct, Dave.  Yeah.  You got that trivia question right.  I got that one on Rock and Roll Jeopardy.  Now, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees and Grammy Award winners are out with their  new release, 13.  Why are you reading this off a piece of paper?  No, there is no paper.  I thought we were supposed to be having conversations.  Is this a live read that you tried to segue into without me knowing?  We're just having conversations.  Oh, all right.  Anyway, as I was saying, it's the first time the guys have recorded, I'm not, a studio  album since 1978's Never Say Die. 
[03:36:00]  They're back, and they're better than ever.  Wait till I tell you about this, Dave.  I heard the new song.  It sounds great.  You know who they're joined on the album, 13, by?  Kid Rock, MoFo.  Race Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk, is what I was going to say.  And the album is produced.  He's very good.  By seven-time Grammy winner Rick Rubin.  Rubin.  I knew that.  That's correct.  You'd be good on Rock and Roll Jeopardy.  Check out BlackSabbat.com, which is the first ever official Black Sabbath website for the  latest news on the reunion, the new album, and the world tour hitting the U.S. this summer. 
[03:36:30]  The new Black Sabbath album, 13, is out now.  And you can go to Best Buy or BestBuy.com and pick up an exclusive deluxe version of  the CD with a bonus track.  What does that come with?  Well, it comes with a bonus track for $15.99, or you can grab the Fan Pack.  Wait till I tell you about this, Dave.  What does that come with?  What does the Fan Pack come with?  It's got the deluxe CD, but it's also got a t-shirt for just $29.99.  Whoa.  Get eight new songs and almost an hour of brand new Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne. 
[03:37:00]  I love them, man.  And the original members.  One of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time.  Black Sabbath's new album, 13, is available now.  Now, get yours at Best Buy with a special bonus track and t-shirt.  Tomorrow, Jim Norton wanted to make sure I reminded you, tomorrow, he will be giving away  a signed copy of that album.  Holy shit.  I'm going to call in.  How can I get that signed copy?  How do I get it?  I'll probably do a phone thing tomorrow.  You know what?  I love my favorite Black Sabbath song is when they go, 
[03:37:30]  Hey, little thing, let me light the candy, cause I'm on my arms.  I'm sure I had a nice around.  I'm almost...  Okay, E-Rock, you're the music guy, but is that...  Black Sabbath?  No, that would be Black Crows.  Okay, that's what I thought, too.  Black Crows?  I thought it was Black Crows, as well.  Okay, how about this?  This song by Black Sabbath.  Oh, uh-oh, I got the love that keeps me waiting.  I'm a lonely boy.  Remember that song?  What was that from?  I don't think that's Black Sabbath.  E-Rock music guy?  I don't know that one. 
[03:38:00]  E-Rock.  The black is in the title.  I'm obviously going on a theme here.  Come on.  I knew we wouldn't have to get fucked into this before that happened.  Black Keys?  No, you picked an obscure one by the Black Keys.  Black Keys!  Yeah, I know, that's on every fucking...  It's not a big single.  Mitsubishi commercial.  You can't see, like, a fucking microwave popcorn commercial without that I'm a Lonely Boy  song getting played here.  Oh, boy.  What?  Do you want...  This is a negative Dave call.  Uh, what's...  I'll give you the X if I don't like it.  Okay. 
[03:38:30]  Matt in Pennsylvania.  Damn, what's the Haps?  Chilling.  Yeah.  If you give this...  You're a fucking asshole!  Okay.  What's the Haps?  Get your own identity.  You got the X.  Get your own fucking, you know, personality.  You got the X.  Hey, what's the Haps?  I love it when people...  And here's the other thing, you know, when people just do, like, for instance, like a  Jim Norton character...  Yeah.  ...and they're just posting, like, that character, like, you know, um, Chip.  Mm-hmm.  It... 
[03:39:00]  It...  Doesn't that bother you?  I mean, it's...  It's not a strange thing when someone...  They don't have their own personal...  That's Jim Norton's character.  He invented that.  It is, but I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, is it not?  Dang!  What's the Haps?  I mean, you'd probably like it if people were, uh...  We're tweeting as fucking stuff, guy.  No!  You wouldn't like that?  I wouldn't!  That's mine!  Would it freak you out a little bit?  No, that's mine!  I put...  I know it seems hard to believe, but I actually put thought into that. 
[03:39:30]  By the way...  What about Davey Red?  Fucking stuff, guy.  No, Davey Red is mine.  Will fucking stuff, guy, be part of the Davey Mac movie spectacular that I keep hearing about?  Tell me about this movie spectacular.  You've been making YouTube videos for a while now.  A long time.  And we've been recognized as the greatest YouTube comedy makers of all time.  By...  My son and my mom.  And anyway, so, uh, yeah, so, um, over one million views, and, uh, we've gotten, uh,  critical, uh, acclaim, and so someone said...  Your mom is a critic?  Maybe.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:40:00]  Um, uh, she's, she's a critic for Big Titted Mommies Monthly.  She does have some nice ones.  Please, Sam, it's disgusting.  You're right, you're right.  That was way out of line.  Anyway, uh, uh, so then we said, well, we'll put together a night, and we'll show the 20,  you know, I mean, when I say 25, people are gonna be like, what the fuck?  Um, the, the shortest ones are like 45 seconds, the longest one is about three minutes, so  that's why you can fit, we're gonna get them all done in about an hour, hour ten.  They're brief.  So, um, it's gonna be a really fun night, and we're gonna be there early, drinking, it's  at The Stand, so you get tickets at thestandnyc.com, or just go to my Twitter, at Eastside Dave, 
[03:40:30]  Facebook, Eastside Dave, whatever.  There's links all over the place, or thestandnyc.com.  That sounds terrific.  Dan.  It's gonna be fun.  Are you coming?  Uh, Tuesday.  Tuesday, the 18th.  Tuesday, June 18th.  I will be there.  Yes.  Dan.  Yes.  In Miami.  You should've told me, I would've put a special delivery thing in there.  Dave, you two rule.  You're too late?  Well, I, I had to do the set list, the, the, yeah, the set list is on.  It's fucking YouTube, who gives a shit? 
[03:41:00]  It's not until next Tuesday.  They're not gonna play off of YouTube, they're gonna, they're gonna put it, they, they put  it in a disc.  You've remastered the originals?  Yeah, we've remastered and packaged them so that they, they look nice and clear.  Are you gonna sell the DVDs?  No.  That, that's, that's why I need you back in my life.  You didn't think to make DVDs?  No, I didn't.  It'd be so easy.  I know.  Shit.  Eric, can I feel about, uh, 50 DVDs?  Do you wish you had thought of that?  Yup.  I know we're selling t-shirts.  Yeah, but what if you had added DVD that you could take home with all 25 movies? 
[03:41:30]  Goddamn!  You could fit them all on one disc.  Nope, didn't think of that.  And you could do something stupid, like draw cover art and then Xerox it or something?  No, I know, I get it.  I get the point.  It'd be so easy.  I know.  And cheap.  It would've been.  You could sell for like 25 bucks.  Oh, fuck.  Plus, you come on the air and you're like, you're, you're at this point, you're like,  you don't have the pride left.  You're saying, ladies and gentlemen, I need fucking money.  Yeah, yeah.  And people would be like, alright, I'll buy a DVD.  Right.  Just give me money.  Right.  This thing is, is to get 15, it's a $15 ticket. 
[03:42:00]  It's not like a, I need a lot.  But that gives the kids three diapers in this economy.  You should see if between now and then you can get a couple DVDs made.  I should see that.  Eric, help me out with that.  Help him out, Eric.  You never do anything.  And by the way, you called me saying that Eric promised you twice that he would plug your  movie festival on the Opie and Anthony show.  Has he?  Your appearance on today's Opie and Anthony show.  The first anyone's heard.  I knew it.  The first anyone's heard of the big deal.  But you know what, he did do the Facebook page, so I appreciate that.  And he's up there again today. 
[03:42:30]  I appreciate that, Eric.  Unbelievable.  Dan in Miami.  Prime phone, Sam Roberts, Eastside Dave.  You both rule.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  I got something I learned on today's show.  Yeah.  That Pharah Abraham is a raging cunt.  You found her to be cunty.  I listened to that segment as well.  Oh, super cunty.  Talk to me about it, Dave.  And she was not very nice.  I think it was Jim Norton, or it might have been Anthony, who said something to the effect  of, they said, something like one of these videos or one of your porn shots. 
[03:43:00]  Right, right.  I remember.  And she made a big deal of that phrase.  She goes, wait, wait, what do you mean?  I've only done this one time.  And by the way.  Hello, sweetheart.  Once you've done butt sex.  On film.  On film that you're selling.  Yeah.  Don't start playing them more morality.  I only did one.  Yeah, but that one thing, that's pretty big time.  The only reason you've ever done one is because where are we going to go from there?  I know.  We've done the butt already.  I know.  And this whole, like.  Well, like a clown.  No, no.  You can do like a DP type of situation. 
[03:43:30]  That is the next one.  And the next one will probably also be, no, I was making this DP video.  I thought it was going to be private.  I've been watching a lot of DP porn lately.  Really?  I don't even know what that says about me.  But I did want to announce at the Davey Nack Movathon, we will be selling DVDs of the  girls' porn, teen moms' pornography.  Bootleg copies.  Not official.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pepper's rattling off 200 bootlegs as we speak.  You're going to sign them, too?  Yeah.  Did you believe her for a second when she said, this is the teen mom, Farrah, who's on 
[03:44:00]  O&A today.  And she goes, well, the video that I made, the sex tape, was private.  I got her, I had private sex with a porn star that I filmed and acted like I was a porn.  No.  Of course not.  Not for a second.  Stop it.  Stop it.  The whole story was silly.  It was just a silly story.  I mean, she's saying people who don't know, you know, who don't realize that they're going  to be selling that porn tape, they don't say things like, stick it in my butt. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Or like, ooh.  Well, I'm not going to actually say what she said because, you know what?  No, because things get isolated around here and there's enough audio of you saying ridiculous  things.  Good.  You say, all right.  We say something.  Well, she mentioned how badly that you wanted it.  I wanted it in the ass.  There, I was saying it like Santa.  That does sound just like me.  By the way, you were on the crossover the other night.  Yeah.  On NBC.  See it?  I did.  You watched it?  I watched it.  What did you think?  I watched it through clenched fists and teeth.  And anger.  Why? 
[03:45:00]  I don't know.  I had Michelle Beadle on my show and I said, hey, I do the Davey Mac sports program.  It's a sports and pop culture show.  It's like we cross over sports and pop culture.  And she's like, huh, interesting.  And I go, yeah, I'd love to be on your show.  Right.  I even showed her my fucking surprise tattoo.  Yeah, I listened to your interview and it was more of a, well, it was more of a pitch  for yourself.  And you announced, you announced, I do a sports show. 
[03:45:30]  You want to see what I would do for you if I was on your show.  And you took off your shirt.  I took off my shirt.  And showed her the Sopranos tattoo.  Okay.  So some people would say that was creeping her out.  Yeah.  But all of a sudden, a massively hungover Dave McDonald, red hair, taking off his shirt.  And she's just sitting there like, okay, I'm just, yeah, what is this?  But...  Where is she and I at a good time?  She would go the whole distance.  I know, but don't you think that the crossover could be more, shall we say, daily show-ish?  And as a result, like, do, like, man-the-street stuff? 
[03:46:00]  That's what I was pitching myself to her for.  I'll go out there, be your little fucking sports guy, but I'll go up to people and be  like, hey, homeless guy, what do you think about your bullshit, bullshit?  That kind of thing.  Right.  Well, I mean, I'm not booking the crossover.  I was booked on it.  No, listen.  You get me on the crossover within 14 days.  You see, this is...  Or I'm going to bomb this fucking studio.  This is where it becomes difficult, because a lot of people in my life said, Sam, I saw  you on the crossover.  Right.  You did a great job.  Yeah.  Or they said...  You did reasonably well.  They said, congratulations. 
[03:46:30]  No.  Or they said, oh, this is great.  No.  I made a phone call to Sam.  Whereas you, who I thought was, like, a good friend of mine...  Yeah, I was at your wedding.  ...said you.  You were at my wedding.  We had a great time.  You go, oh, yeah, I saw...  You brought it up just now.  I saw you on the crossover.  I go, oh, what did you think?  And you started shouting, and you said you were angry, and your only reaction was,  quote, speaking about yourself in the third person, why don't you get the Dave man on  the show?  Even E-Rock texted me and said, good job on the show. 
[03:47:00]  No.  Not, not...  Hey, why don't you get the Nagel man on the show?  I'm not talking...  Well, yeah, but E-Rock doesn't want to go on the crossover.  I pitched to the crossover.  I mean, if there was some, like, Simpsons roundup show...  I do now, Sam.  Can you get me on the crossover?  Sam, no.  If you do, if you get E-Rock on that show beforehand, forget it.  You're going to shoot me with a machine gun.  No, I'm actually just going to make gun noises.  Ow, ow.  Yeah, but I'm going to do it really close behind your neck, so it's annoying.  Well, why wouldn't you get me on TruTV?  Of course I will.  When? 
[03:47:30]  If we do, like, a wash one hand, wash the other?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'll call Mike Traynor now.  Do it.  I'll fucking call.  Get him on the line.  Do it.  Do it on your cell.  Do it on speaker.  I'll do it on my cell.  Yeah, yeah, because I'll answer from your cell.  Fine.  And say, hey, I got this guy, Sam Roberts.  You've got to get him on TruTV.  Just hold the fucking phone.  I'll call.  If people don't know Mike Traynor...  Nobody knows who Mike Traynor is.  He's a comedian.  Okay.  And he's a big-time comedian, and he does...  He's not only a writer, but he's also one of the faces on World's Dumbest show on TruTV. 
[03:48:00]  He got me on that show, acting.  I see.  In my role.  So I was a big starring role in that performance.  I've been nominated for an Emmy.  You were literally on the show for 12 seconds.  Mike Traynor?  Yeah.  Tell him he's on the air.  It's Dave McDonald.  You're on the air.  You're on the Open Anthe Channel on SiriusXM.  Of course I am.  How's it going?  Listen, Mike.  You have to do me a favor, okay?  Yeah.  It's this thing that I'm doing with this motherfucking asshole, Sam Roberts. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  This is why.  This is why.  So anyway, I want to get on this show called The Crossover with Michelle Beadle, okay?  And this little fucking prick with this fucking mop top of a fucking haircut, he says, Davey  Mack, you get me on TruTV.  That's not what I said.  I'll get you on Michelle Beadle's show.  That's not what I said at all.  So Mike Traynor, I'm asking you for a favor.  Is there any way Sam Roberts can be on TruTV within the next week?  Well, you're live right now. 
[03:49:00]  I want to make that clear.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I get it.  I get it.  I get what's going on.  I've had a pretty low success rate we're getting people on the show.  You're one of them.  Looks like you're in, Sam.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  Mike, I'll talk.  Just hang out by then.  You think you're coming to my show on Saturday?  Two Saturdays?  In a couple weeks.  Okay.  Thank you, Mike.  Yeah, it's basically a done deal.  I pretty much start spending the money now.  Thank you.  Look, Mike wants to give you some career advice. 
[03:49:30]  He's a very funny comedian, by the way, Mike Traynor.  It's good that you just dismissed a professional comedian like that.  I'm sorry.  He's not Rich Voss, for Christ's sakes.  Mike in the Bronx wants to give you some advice.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Eastside Bay, you're the best.  No, you're the best.  You got one thing to do.  Take out Sam Roberts.  It's all yours.  I'm seriously thinking about it.  Now, have you thought that maybe your approach might be a bit hostile?  Oh, it's very hostile.  Yeah, and how's that?  I thought that's a good approach.  Yeah, how's that done? 
[03:50:00]  Like, the mafiosa, they're not like, hey, Sam, can you do me a favor?  They're like, hey, get this fucking done.  That's the approach I'm taking.  How's that done for you?  Oh, I mean, I'm going nowhere fast.  But I do have my own event at The Stand in June 18th, this Tuesday in New York City, where  people can get the tickets for TheStandNYC.com or on my thing.  And you heard confirmation from Mr. Opie, from Sam Roberts, from Bob Kelly, and I think  I can get Anthony by Tuesday. 
[03:50:30]  Opie's not going to be there.  He's going to be there.  No, he won't.  And Iraq's coming, too.  Iraq, you tell me.  Is Opie going to be there?  I think Opie's going to come.  You know what?  With me, he doesn't lie.  I'll tell you why.  I've only invited, see, because I fucking pick and choose my spots.  I invited him to a birthday party a couple years ago.  He came, remember?  Which birthday party?  The birthday party where you and I sang the fucking Oasis song.  Right, in the city.  I choose my spots.  It's not every fucking time.  Right.  You know?  Right. 
[03:51:00]  So it's going to be a big deal.  Iraq, you think Opie's going to be there?  I think he may want to get out for a little bit and get away from the kids.  He'll stop by.  That's a perfect excuse.  He's...  Eric is...  Sam, you don't have kids.  I'm telling you.  They're like little fucking vampires.  Are they?  They suck.  You're unhappy with them.  No, I love them.  Right.  Because it's...  It's hard to explain.  You know, you...  When they do certain things, it's a natural, like, adrenaline high that, like, when your daughter  comes home and fucking all out of the blue, she can read, which my daughter has done. 
[03:51:30]  I don't know.  It's all of a sudden, it's like, she's like, you know, it was a long time ago.  Right.  It was in the 1800s and she's reading fucking Charles Dickens by now.  This is going to be goodwill hunting in no time.  Just formulas solved around your house.  And that's what you want from your little girl?  From your little boy?  You want what I have?  Sam...  I mean, Sam.  I almost called my son Sam.  That's all right.  I'm sure it's not the first time.  Anthony McDonald can throw a fucking ball through a window.  Really?  He's got a Troy Aikman arm, this kid. 
[03:52:00]  Incredible.  Yeah.  So you're fine.  Just hang in there until those kids get older and they'll take you to Easy Street.  That's what I'm hoping.  No problem.  But, you know, in the meantime, it's not easy, Samuel.  I know.  I pray to you.  I've been praying for a long time that your wonderful wife gets pregnant and that you  experience the same trauma.  I am going to laugh my dick off.  Why do you think that...  I am going to...  Oh, my God, people.  Why do you want bad things for me?  Is the question.  No, I'd say I want you to have a child to experience what I'm experiencing. 
[03:52:30]  I'm just confused as to why I would have brought you on my...  This is my show, actually.  This is your show?  Mine.  No, we're having a good time.  We're just being here.  Brian in Texas.  Yeah, I was wondering what time did Opie get on to his Sudoku puzzle perhaps today?  Opie completed his Sudoku puzzle and he had it signed by Seth Rogen.  Do you want this puzzle?  Whoa.  Hell yeah.  All right, you won the puzzle.  You're giving away a Seth Rogen signature?  Yeah.  That's fucking good.  Hold on, Brian.  This guy just calls up.  You just won it.  And all of a sudden he gets something. 
[03:53:00]  That's it.  Speaking of Seth Rogen, let's bring in...  He's great.  ...everybody's favorite interns.  This semester's intern class, Jackie and Sidney.  Let's bring them in.  Yeah, they're coming.  Do they have music?  Question from Jim in Alabama.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, Sam.  I was wondering if you guys in the think tank there can work out a deal to bring Eastside  Dave to the show and get rid of Sal.  Would you take Sal's job?  For what?  Money. 
[03:53:30]  What do you mean for what?  No, I mean for doing the after show?  Yes.  No, no, no.  No.  Sal is in here.  My name's Sam.  Sam Roberts.  You have to explain things to me.  Do you know who Sal is?  No, I'm not.  You don't know who Sal is.  Oh, yes, yes.  Bring Sal in here.  Yes, I do.  Bring Sal in here.  I didn't mean to say that.  Yes, I do.  Bring Sal in here.  He's another O&A producer.  There's many of us, you've noticed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know him.  I know him.  I know him.  I didn't mean to say that.  He can't come in.  What's he doing?  He's doing something in the back there.  Ask what he's doing.  Hold on.  I'll call him again.  So what does he do?  Nothing. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, he doesn't do anything?  No.  He just sits there at the computer all day.  I'd love to do nothing.  Get paid for it.  Oh, he's afraid of Troy.  Very scared of Troy.  Would you be okay with that?  If you came in and you were scared, you'd have to be scared of Troy.  I mean, I'm not going to be scared of Troy.  Where's Sidney?  I like Troy.  We get along.  Sidney's helping Sal.  How many people?  What's Troy working?  Bring Troy in here.  All right.  I want to know what kind of control Troy has over these people. 
[03:54:30]  I tell you one thing that I'd like, though, I'd like to be E-Rock's boss.  That would be fun.  You would.  Well, you just were.  You told him what to play.  You told him.  Troy, you got the whole staff shook up.  How come everybody's, what do you got everybody working on?  I need something done.  You need some production done, right?  Can you tell me what we're working on?  Just working on a promo.  Oh, it's nothing major.  Look at me.  It's not exciting.  I know everything about radio there is to know.  I called it before the guy even walked in the room.  You think Eastside Dave would be a good replacement for Sal? 
[03:55:00]  If it has to do with production?  Yeah.  I don't really like to do the buttons and shit.  This is Sal boat.  That's not me.  Okay, I know Sal.  Oh, Sal is far better at production than Dave.  Okay.  Dave's more entertaining on air, obviously.  I don't do the production.  That's not what I like to do.  Okay, so we can't, then we can't.  No, I mean, I'll do it.  We can't make the trade then.  But, I mean, you know.  Sal, you're safe.  Let me give you an example.  I did these parody songs for Rana Fez.  There was this guy, AJ Dynamite. 
[03:55:30]  And I did intro songs for him.  Yeah.  And, like, for instance, one of them was Queen, you know, Flash Gordon.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  But I just took the Queen song and then sang AJ Dynamite over it.  Okay.  I didn't even take out Freddie Mercury's vocals.  Sal, would you have done that differently?  Probably, yeah.  You probably would have done that.  Troy, do you think you could have made that sound any smoother based on his description?  Yeah, I've been involved with Dave at the time in his production.  You have?  I have.  And how is it?  Because remember when I used to sit out in the hallway there and Dave would be like,  Troy, come here quick. 
[03:56:00]  Come here.  Oh, that's right.  Troy used to do a lot of voicers for me.  Yeah, he'd bring me into the booth.  Wait, wait.  Are they called voicers?  Whatever the fuck they're called.  I don't know the terminology.  Voicers.  Okay.  But then he called me in and then he just had a very crude way of doing production.  It's kind of guerrilla production.  What my, I like to categorize my thing as like velvet underground, very lo-fi.  I'm not, Troy, on the other hand, is, you know, Sergeant Peppers or Pink Floyd.  I am very lo-fi.  You're not going to get a lot.  The Ramones, that's my style.  E-Rock, do you have the one he's talking about, the A.J. Dynamite piece? 
[03:56:30]  I have the Queen one.  Is that the one you were talking about?  Go for that one.  That's probably it.  Well, there's, they're all Queen.  Oh, this is pretty bad.  This isn't...  A.J. Dynamite!  Sit down, monkey!  Sit down, monkey!  A.J. Dynamite!  I can't bring Mercury in!  A.J. Dynamite!  Jackie, as kind of a newcomer into this radio industry, what did you think about that production?  You come from a long line of radio history, Brother Wheeze, now the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:57:00]  What did you think?  Yeah, it was terrible.  You did not like that.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck, man?  It wasn't terrible.  It was funny in the end.  You got to turn...  Funny in...  You need to hear you more than the song.  I have another one.  Wait, wait, wait.  Sal.  You have another one.  Funny in what way?  Because it was fucking funny.  Like, it was funny that it was so poorly put together.  It's funny because you know Dave.  If you don't know Dave, I don't know if that's going to stand on top.  Okay, I got you.  It is going to stand on top.  Okay, here, I play next one.  I got to you.  Because everybody's like, oh, Dave's kind of retarded.  So it's funny.  It's funny because you stand over it.  And you can clearly hear the other vocals. 
[03:57:30]  Let's hear another A.J. Dynamite.  Is it retarded or is it somewhat genius?  That's what I'd like.  No, probably retarded.  Genius, genius, genius.  Go ahead.  A.J. Dynamite!  Come on!  A.J. Dynamite!  Takes his time and takes his money!  A.J. Dynamite!  Another Queen song, by the way.  You couldn't even find an instrumental?  No.  And here's the thing.  Actually, yeah.  They're on YouTube.  If E-Rock went through it, I did four or five things and they were all Queen songs.  Now that I think about it.  I don't even know why I just decided to stick with Queen.  It's not like he's any attachment to Freddie Mercury. 
[03:58:00]  John in Massachusetts has a question for you.  Yeah, Dave.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a fan of yours.  What do you call it?  I wonder, do you ever think of, instead of this nonsense, trying to get back in on the  Ron and Fez show, and do you think maybe leaving was a colossal mistake?  I always wondered that.  What's that?  What walking out?  What was walking out?  He wants to know if leaving Ron and Fez was a huge mistake and if you would go back.  Well, I mean, listen.  Everything is everything.  You know what I mean?  I mean...  The whole deal has been a huge mistake? 
[03:58:30]  No, no, no.  No, it's not.  Nothing was a huge mistake.  Everything happens for a reason.  Gotcha.  And, you know, I also, at the time, I had, I was working at a New Jersey station in the  morning and shit like that.  You got fired from that, correct?  I didn't get fired.  I didn't get fired.  I also had a money debate with a certain guy at that station.  See, you know, I understand that radio doesn't pay well, but you have to pay people enough  to live with two children. 
[03:59:00]  Or?  And especially when they're on the air.  Or what's the other option?  And I'm saying, I'm talking mainly about the New Jersey station.  Do you have to, or can you choose to...  I'll get it.  I'm going to, yes.  I've decided to sell vacuums.  That's going to be my new job.  You're going to sell vacuums.  Well, you know what you could do?  You got to get some kind of money.  Because, uh, you need to know...  Is this another live read?  No.  Oh, okay.  You have a beautiful wife.  She was discussed on O&A today.  Yeah, right.  Do you know what the best gift to give the woman in your life is? 
[03:59:30]  It's a fucking live read.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It is.  Do you know what the best gift is?  No.  It's the best gift for...  What the best gift for any occasion, or no occasion at all.  Yeah?  An I love you gift.  You're probably sitting there going, what?  Is an I love you gift?  No, I'm sitting there going, what the fuck is this live read?  It's not a live read.  It's a gift.  You get interrupted.  A nice conversation.  It's a gift that says, without words, how much she truly means to you.  It shows how much you love her, appreciate her, value her.  It's something that she can keep forever, and look at every day to remind her how much you

Now that's just me.  If I can be honest, it's probably fake.  Well, Dave, I appreciate you being here.  Sam, this was an absolute pleasure.
