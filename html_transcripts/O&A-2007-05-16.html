<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically crude and offensive humor directed at their listeners.  They then moved on to discussing the death of Jerry Falwell, referencing Larry Flynt's past feud with Falwell and their subsequent unlikely friendship.  The Republican presidential primary debates were dismissed as a "snooze fest," with criticism aimed at Giuliani's reliance on 9/11 rhetoric and Newt Gingrich's perceived irrelevance.  The hosts then shifted their focus to Paris Hilton's impending jail sentence, speculating on the prison conditions in Nevada and whether her incarceration would be genuine or a publicity stunt.  They debated the purpose of her self-defense classes and compared her situation to other celebrities who had served time, such as Martha Stewart and Joey Buttafuoco, mentioning a comment by former hooker Natalia in Page Six.  The hosts engaged in graphic fantasies about Hilton's potential prison experiences.

A significant portion of the show featured Rich Voss as a guest.  Voss recounted various "prison stories," mostly involving brief stays in city jails.  He described wearing extremely short shorts and a tank top to court while carrying a skateboard, claiming it was an attempt to ingratiate himself with drug dealers.  The hosts pressed him aggressively for details, leading to an extended, sexually suggestive, and increasingly uncomfortable exchange about Voss's intentions and interactions with the drug dealers.  This culminated in a humorous song by the hosts about Voss's experiences, maintaining the sexually explicit and offensive tone.  Voss also shared his experience receiving an eight-weekend county jail sentence for driving with a revoked license and no insurance, describing the emotional impact as similar to having a TV show cancelled. He discussed his favorite prison movies (*An Innocent Man*, *Short Eyes*), and his time spent in New York's "Tombs" holding cells.  His "prison experience" largely consisted of watching prison movies and reading prison books, and associating with friends who had served time.

The show included a humorous segment about a West Palm Beach news reporter whose teleprompter malfunctioned, leading him to deliver nonsensical sentences, ironically praising an indecent exposure offender.  Voss discussed his upcoming comedy club appearances and his involvement in the "One Traveling Virus" comedy tour, detailing the tour's "O&A Village" tailgating atmosphere, experiences with overly enthusiastic fans offering warm beers, and past open mic nights hosted by Opie and Anthony.  He recounted awkward encounters with club owners, including one who offered him $50 to cancel a show, and another where a banquet hall's sound system malfunctioned.  The hosts promoted the "One Traveling Virus" tour, listing dates, locations, and comedians (Stephen Lynch, Bob Saget, Bob Kelly, Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, and Frank Kelly), discussing challenges with complimentary tickets and Jimmy's aversion to friends and family in the front rows, also mentioning Jimmy's awkward stage wave.

A segment featuring a BBC interview with a Scientologist was played, showing a heated exchange between reporter John Sweeney (repeatedly referring to Scientology as a cult) and Tommy Davis, who became increasingly angry.  The hosts then discussed various religions, before moving to a story about Cruella, a woman arrested for enslaving Indonesian women on Long Island, detailing the alleged abuse and the media's coverage of the story.

Later in the show, a news story about a wealthy couple accused of holding women against their will in deplorable conditions was discussed, speculating on their motives (sexual favors or disciplinary measures).  This led to a discussion of the book "The Perfect Victim," about the kidnapping and abuse of Colleen Stan.  The hosts then touched upon the arrest of David Faustino (Bud Bundy) for marijuana possession and disorderly intoxication, reminiscing about *Married...with Children* and comparing its comedic merit to other sitcoms (*MASH*, *Taxi*, *All in the Family*, *The Honeymooners*).  They discussed *Back to the Future*'s prediction of flying cars.  A significant part was dedicated to "popcorn lung," a lung disease linked to diacetyl in microwave popcorn, discussing health risks for factory workers and the potential threat to consumers,  interspersing the discussion with humorous asides and wordplay. The show concluded with audio of Michael Bolton's disastrous National Anthem performance, comparing it to the earlier news reporter's mishap, and featuring comedic impressions by Roland and promotional plugs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school. 
[00:04:00]  You probably have three or four kids and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I would like to apologize.  I would like to apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in.  Anthony.  I just think Nazi and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious.  Hilarious people.  You guys ready to laugh? 
[00:04:30]  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:05:30]  Jerry Falwell died.  I heard.  73.  Bad ticker.  Yeah.  He's a fun guy.  Yeah, always a cheery fellow. 
[00:06:00]  But what's his name from Hustler there?  Larry Flynn.  Larry Flynn put out a little statement.  What did he say?  He said he was, you know, they became friends.  Because they used to debate all the time.  When I was a kid, I used to read Hustler.  And Larry Flynn did the most vile, disgusting parodies with Jerry Falwell.  Yeah, that's why they always ended up in court.  Yeah.  And it was deemed parody, so he was allowed to do it. 
[00:06:30]  But they spent a lot of time then debating each other.  They kind of took it on the road.  Yeah.  Sometimes people do that when they're enemies.  You know, they kind of take it on the road.  Oh, they take advantage of it and make some money.  Yeah.  Go on a speaking tour.  And he actually said he became friends with them.  And that's a little hard to believe.  It doesn't seem like they'd be, you know, over each other's house having coffee.  But, yeah, he's dead.  At 73.  Godspeed.  Yeah.  And then you had the Republican presidential candidates holding their first debate last night. 
[00:07:00]  That was a snooze fest.  When is the election?  It's like in four and a half years from right now.  They, exactly, someone should actually come out and start campaigning for the next election.  Yeah.  Like, I'm throwing my hat in the ring, and everybody would swoop around him, and then just say,  no, for the next election.  I think I can, I think I got that one.  I got it wrapped up. 
[00:07:30]  It's never too early, right?  The only candidate running.  Well, they do kind of do it a little too early.  Yeah.  Because nobody really, I don't know.  I watched a little bit of it.  You know, caught a little bit of it.  And, yeah, just boring.  It's the same old thing.  You had, Giuliani kind of came across looking pretty good, I think.  But he was just using 9-11 over and over again.  And then when somebody brought up the fact that our involvement in Iraq caused 9-11, 
[00:08:00]  he was able to tear into them.  There, he was on the TV screen.  He was able to tear into them and kind of make them look stupid.  Yeah.  Got a big round of applause.  Did somebody tell Newt Gingrich nobody needs to hear from him?  Dude, he hasn't been in the spotlight nine years.  Now he's popping up like, all right, relax, folks.  I'm here.  Like, you're an ass man.  You're to save the day.  Yeah, exactly.  Nobody cares about Newt Gingrich.  Is he jumping into the election, though, I guess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think the Republicans see an opportunity, to tell you the truth. 
[00:08:30]  Even though, I mean, they certainly aren't on the top of people's popularity lists.  But I think they see an opportunity that the Democrats are kind of going for this never-before-uncharted territory ticket kind of a thing.  Because really, the frontrunners here are Obama and Hillary.  And a woman and a black guy.  It's pretty, as frontrunners, are pretty uncharted.  That's pretty uncharted territory.  So I think the Republicans are thinking if the country stays with its mainstream attitude and doesn't really take their Democratic tickets seriously, if it's a woman or a minority, that they got a chance. 
[00:09:00]  So you're going to get all these guys throwing their hat in thinking that they got a shot.  And who's in third place for the Democrats?  Exactly.  Who's the poor guy in third place?  Is it Edwards?  Is he even running?  I don't know. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  See?  I think he is.  Because all you hear about is Hillary and Obama.  Yeah.  There's got to be another one.  I don't know.  Larry Flint.  Maybe Larry.  Oh, his stupid hat in the ring.  Oh, jeez.  And then you've got Paris Hilton.  She's traumatized about going to jail.  She's making a real big deal about this.  And they're talking about maybe sending her to the pink prison in the middle of the desert.  Which one's that?  We talked about it.  It's that prison in the middle of the desert in Nevada or something.  It's not that tent city one. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The tent city.  Something about overcrowding.  So that guy, the whatever, he basically said he would take her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is it a nicer place?  No.  They say it's miserable out there.  You've got to wear the pink jumpsuits, which is the least of your problems.  You've got to be outside.  And work very hard.  It's hot.  Under the tent in tent city.  Oh, okay.  That was that one that they say that they end up stinking real bad because they can't 
[00:10:30]  shower as often as they want.  Yeah, exactly.  They make you work the whole time.  It's over 100 degrees in the desert.  Geez, what did she really do?  She deserves it.  Really?  I'm fighting for a longer jail sentence.  The more I hear about this, the happier I am.  She's just, everything you read about her makes her seem like she's a spoiled, awful little  bitch and you just want to see her go to jail.  Yeah?  Yes.  Yes.  She's distraught.  And she's taking self-defense classes and now she's crying. 
[00:11:00]  She can't get up.  You know what?  The whole self-defense thing is, it's Paris being Paris.  She's brilliant.  She knows how to market herself.  One karate class is going to protect her from some of those prison babes that she's  going to be serving time with.  People that have just been working out their whole lives.  She is brilliant how she markets herself.  They did a whole thing on VH1 or E just showing everything she's done in the last few years.  She's not famous for anything except that she just knows how to get everyone's attention 
[00:11:30]  with the oopsie shot.  She invented the oopsie shot.  She invented carrying around like an endangered species instead of a little dog.  Was she a falconeer?  They basically listed all the stuff that she's invented for other celebrities to do.  Yeah.  It used to be the little dog and she said, screw that.  I'm going to walk around with a monkey from the rainforest.  So you think going to jail is going to be the latest celebrity sensation?  Well, no.  Yeah, I know.  No, she got caught.  I mean, she finally got caught being stupid, but her taking a karate class, that is the 
[00:12:00]  same.  That's the old power is still getting more and more attention because she knows, all  right, I might as well take advantage of this and get some stories out.  Do you honestly think that she's doing that for attention, though?  A karate class is going to help you in prison?  Going to prison is a pretty serious thing.  Right.  So you don't think that perhaps she's just kind of a desperate move, but taking these  courses, thinking maybe at least I could fight, fend for myself a little bit more? 
[00:12:30]  Because she obviously knows nothing about fighting.  No.  You think it's a publicity move?  Absolutely, yes.  I'm not too sure about that.  Because I think when it comes down to it, because she is so famous, she's going to be beyond  protected.  So then why would she need the karate class?  Well, if she goes to a karate class, she gets the paparazzi and she gets her name in  the news even more and continues feeding the story.  Beyond protected or...  Feeding her image.  ...people are going to be on her just to say, look at what I did to Paris. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, when you're going to jail, you're not thinking...  Like, I spent one night in jail all my life.  Regular ex-con you are there, Jimmy.  In jail, yes.  And I got prison tattoos and everything.  Anything to make the boys like me.  But you're not thinking of anything.  You're scared.  That's it.  Like, she's thinking about going to jail for over a month.  She's not thinking of like, all right, well, this will be a good photo op.  Because she's already...  She's rich beyond belief.  She doesn't need any more money.  She doesn't need any more attention.  She's already an icon, like, as far as recognition.  What does she care? 
[00:13:30]  I think it's too scary to start thinking about publicity or anything when...  You're going to jail.  That, to me, has always been the scariest thing that could happen to you, besides, you  know, maybe dying.  I don't see it.  I really don't see it that way.  She's seen all the celebrities that had to go to jail and how they're protected and treated  and stuff.  It's going to be a cakewalk.  She's going for some car violations.  She can do that on her head.  Stand it on her head. 
[00:14:00]  She can.  I don't know.  A month in jail is a long time.  That is a long time, man.  And I don't think...  I think she's legitimately petrified.  Like I said, if it was me, this is Paris...  Stupid Paris Hilton.  All right.  If I was going to jail, I'd be in tears.  But are you taking karate classes, really?  I don't know.  Or you figure out how to, like, make a shank?  Put in the situation?  I wouldn't make a shank.  It would get used on me.  I'd pull it out to be a tough guy. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, get away from me.  Next thing, they'd be pulling it out of me.  Well, you'd be poking the holding end into him.  Like the taped up end.  Yeah.  Anyway.  I think it's...  I don't think it's a publicity thing.  I just don't think you think that way when you're going to jail.  Why would you?  She's already...  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  All right.  It's not like she has a project she's plugging or something like that.  She doesn't plug anything.  She's all about just keeping her name in the press. 
[00:15:00]  She's not a legitimate celebrity.  What has she done?  No one knows.  Well, I guess we've seen her work.  Well, yeah.  Well, she invented those, too.  The sex tapes for the most part.  The green night vision sex tape.  Right.  They catch illegals coming into Texas.  They happen to shoot her having sex, and boy, was she good at it.  She tried to be a singing sensation.  You know, stars are blind.  It's so obvious it was just produced in a studio.  So she's not a singer.  She's tried to do... 
[00:15:30]  Well, I mean, she's famous for simple life, obviously, but...  Yeah.  But I mean, that's just her being her.  I don't know.  I just think the whole act of going to jail is enough publicity.  You don't have to bolster that with maybe taking karate classes or something.  What do you mean that was in a studio?  That was her.  Yeah, she's got a beautiful voice.  Here's something.  Do we really care?  Yeah.  Yes.  Have fun, Paris.  Have fun.  I kind of like...  You'll get through it.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, good luck to you.  Martha Stewart wasn't, like, pretty and kissable.  She had the whole, like... 
[00:16:00]  That's what it is, too.  Yeah.  You're going to get some...  Picture some hardcore, like, women prisoners that you see on some of those MSNBC specials  at night when they just focus on a prison that's just, like, really weathered and been in  there a while and just wants to, like, pull a Tyler Durden on a pretty face, you know?  Remember what Edward Norton did in Fight Club?  Of course.  The blonde kid there?  Was that Jared Leto? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it was Leto.  And just, like, beat his face in.  Beat him look ugly.  That might be what someone wants to do.  Fan.  Working by the mic.  What's up?  And he just said, I just wanted to destroy something beautiful.  I just wanted to destroy something beautiful.  She's the image.  When you look at...  Like, Martha Stewart's an older lady.  She's a rich lady, but Paris is the image of spoiled, privileged wealth.  What the people in prison do not appreciate.  Yeah, Martha was, like, making brownies for them. 
[00:17:00]  This is nice.  But she's not going to be in general population.  That's what I keep saying.  And you don't think the Hiltons have some connections to make sure their daughter is at least protected in jail?  Get fresh towels every day in jail?  What is she going to...  She's probably going to have spa treatments every day.  Who are you kidding?  Housekeeping!  You're making it sound like it's someone from, like, Bayshore or something that's going to jail for, you know, DUI or whatever.  Yeah.  This is Paris Hilton.  She'll be protected, but she'll also...  They protected Joey Buttafuoco! 
[00:17:30]  Did they?  Buttafuoco just got out for doing...  I forgot how much time.  He was never in general...  Yes, recently.  He just got out, like, a week ago.  Was he ever?  Two weeks ago.  I don't know what the latest one was.  I don't know.  Joey's a big kid, though, man.  I met him one time in L.A. years ago.  He has hands, like, my face.  Joey's a big kid, man.  And he just...  All I did was have sex, and, you know, he didn't...  And the Girls Gone Wild dude just got out, and he was in jail, but he was also protected, but he was crying like a little girl because somebody in the next cell over was making his life miserable, but he was never in contact with the guy. 
[00:18:00]  What I find odd is they said that a death row inmate was taunting him, and that made him cry, which reminded me of the fat boy scene from Shawshank Redemption when they bet on the fish and who's going to break down first.  Yeah.  They must have picked him.  And look who's jumping in on the Paris story, but my very own good ex-hooker friend, Natalia.  Natalia. 
[00:18:30]  From New York Confidential is actually in page six, and she's telling her, be afraid of jail, and it's the worst experience of your life.  That's what you want to hear.  Whoever this girl's publicist is, by the way, whoever Natalia's publicist is, how she tied her in with the Paris Hilton story is genius.  Because she's an attractive girl in prison, so she's probably got a good insight, but she was a hooker.  Why don't you just get Linda Blair to talk about when she went in 1974.  In caged heat or whatever that was.  What a brilliant publicist this woman has. 
[00:19:00]  I hope you guys are right.  I hope that she's in general population.  We get some fine prison babe films out of it.  A few good stories.  Yeah.  If she wants to keep her fame going, agree to making some kind of prison babe film.  Is that a reality show?  Cage heat for Paris Hilton.  Huh?  I don't want to see her get slashed, but I mean, it is kind of just funny that she's just going to live in those awful conditions for 45 days.  I think just the idea of being in prison to me is the constant state of fear that you'd be in. 
[00:19:30]  Just constantly.  It doesn't matter if you're in general population or isolated.  You just don't know from, and it's all from watching stupid prison movies and hearing stories and stuff,  but you just constantly think somebody's going to come in and do something awful to you.  That's all you think of in prison.  That is the main deterrent of prison for people, is that at some point during your tenure, someone will come in and do something awful to you.  That's why my taxes get paid. 
[00:20:00]  It's not that I love the government.  It's my fear of being assaulted sexually by another man who's larger than me.  Exactly.  I pay my taxes.  That's what keeps people out of prison.  Prison seems like camp with bars, but you can't leave.  But without that assault that's going on, it's, eh, who cares?  You did something wrong.  You go in.  You eat.  You hang out with people.  There's crafts. 
[00:20:30]  There's weightlifting.  You can play a little ball out in the yard.  You know, it's camp.  You know what's creepy?  Driving to Newark Airport, there's a prison right off the highway.  Yeah.  And the last trip I took, they're in the yard just playing basketball.  Yeah.  And we just drove by them like it was no big deal.  It was the strangest thing to see.  It's just the assaults that are the bad part of prison.  Being punished must suck, too.  I don't want to be beaten, either.  Well, that's what I mean.  I don't just mean sexually.  I just mean being assaulted.  It would seem like, you know, you're just walking around and you're around a corner and just get a huge ham fist right in your face for no reason. 
[00:21:00]  I was watching a jail show recently.  They're showing like all this.  They have like security footage for the guard towers.  Yeah.  And when they attack you in a prison yard, it's not like two guys square off and go, all right, let's go.  Yeah.  Not like the movies.  One guy's walking.  All of a sudden, two guys are just there and there's four fists hitting the man at the same time.  Yeah.  Pummel the guy for three seconds.  He's laid out.  Yeah.  Maybe they do that quick stick with the shank.  When they shank you, they shank you a lot and they shank you in the belly. 
[00:21:30]  They don't just give you a quick stabbing and run away.  In the movies, it's always like the shank goes in and then the guy goes like, and he holds the shank into him and says something to him.  Yeah.  This is for Murray.  Yeah.  You know?  And then he slowly goes to the ground.  But in real life, it's just, this is for Murray.  Murray.  Murray.  Murray was very angry with the prisoner.  He had to shank him and let him know.  That's the worst jail name I've ever heard.  Murray. 
[00:22:00]  Don't you say it to Lou or Ted?  Murray.  He went to old school.  So yeah, every time you see like a-  This is for Mr. Slaughter.  Every time I see one, it's just, it's brutal.  The life, it kind of makes you feel like if that's my competition as a male, like when you want to get down to it, not financially or career-wise, but as like breeding creatures, like male, female.  If that's the competition, I mean, I'm finished.  Yeah, you're done.  I'm finished. 
[00:22:30]  I have nothing.  Yeah, that's how it used to be, too, before we made all this stuff around us.  It was pretty much just, yeah, those criminals and stuff running around with everybody else.  Yeah.  And you had to fend them off.  Yeah.  That's why we invented guns.  Guns and jails and everything else.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're just getting started here.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  We got things to talk about, and we'll do that next.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Herbie and Anthony just got me wild.  I just got wild.  We'd tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on 92.3 3FM.  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We were talking about Paris Hilton going to jail and blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:23:30]  And then we get word from the green room.  Rich Voss has prison stories or something.  Prison stories?  And we're all sitting here like...  When did he do time?  He never went to jail.  What is he talking about?  I know the guy had a pretty extensive drug career.  Rich, we were talking about Paris Hilton going to jail, and we hear that you got prison  stories.  Well, yeah.  I mean, they're not exactly prison stories or really county stories, but I did spend a 
[00:24:00]  couple different nights in city jails in my hometown.  For what?  Don't tell me.  D-Wee.  Yeah, pretty much traffic and revoke list.  But I remember one time...  Revoke list?  Being on the revoke list.  You know, driving on the revoke list.  When your license is revoked?  Yeah, it's the revoke list.  When your license is taken away.  I just heard driving with a revoked license.  I never heard of this revoked list, but...  Yeah, I was on the list.  It was me and six other guys in Jersey that were on the list. 
[00:24:30]  And I remember being in city jail, and I wanted to be kind of tough and stuff, so I burnt my  name up in the ceiling, because they would take toilet paper or lighters, and you would  burn your name like you did time, you know?  And I did probably about...  Like you did time.  I did like eight hours.  And he's marking time like it's years for hours.  He's got the five slash eight.  Yeah, I had quarter to seven until my mother bailed me out. 
[00:25:00]  He didn't even get...  He got, Voss was he, and it was time to leave.  Like, oh, I can leave?  Yeah, screw this.  Can I just write the R-E?  No.  Leave.  And then...  Did you squint when you walked out?  Like you'd been in the hole for so long, even though it was like light when you went  in and light when you got out?  Like what?  Brew Baker?  Was it Brew Baker?  He should have taken care of himself like Brooks did in Shawshank.  When you got out, just hang yourself to everyone in favor, Voss.  I went and collected my stuff at the window, and instead of gaining interest, I owed them 
[00:25:30]  money.  That's how short I was in there.  You know?  And all the other two guys, you know, were yelling at my mom.  So you really don't have prisons.  Well, I do.  Another one.  I have another one, too.  These are, you know, prison.  What do you see in prison?  I mean, incarcerated, you know, against your will would be like being in prison.  I have rehab stories, too.  One time...  Rehab is not like prison.  Well, to some extent.  I've never been to either. 
[00:26:00]  Well, no, it isn't.  But I'm assuming any TV show I've seen on rehab, it doesn't look like prison to me.  Well, no.  Well, but here's another one.  I had to go to court because...  Oh, wow.  Because my dog got loose a lot, and my dog got loose.  Voss, you just don't have prison stories, do you?  All right.  Let's hear the good one.  The dog got loose.  He's got a good one.  My dog got loose.  I had a big dog, Betts, and...  Betts?  Yeah, cool.  Don't be gambling at it, you are. 
[00:26:30]  Use your dog into your addiction.  Yes.  So, come here, double down.  I had to go to court, and I showed up, and I had real short shorts back in the...  Remember you had those shorts without the pockets?  No, I didn't.  Okay.  Wait, how short were your shorts?  They were, like, up to here.  You were wearing, like, hot pants.  Yeah.  That's the...  Daisy Dukes?  Wait, were your...  Daisy Dukes.  Daisy Dukes.  Were your jean shorts so short you could see the pockets? 
[00:27:00]  There wasn't any pockets, but if there were, you could see them.  You were wearing, like, girls shorts.  That's what, yeah, girls would wear.  Well, at least if a guy is wearing short shorts, you see, like, the pockets sticking out.  With some cheek hanging out the back?  Well, I used to wear them to certain people's houses, you know, to try to take advantage  of certain situations.  Anyhow...  What?  I'll discuss it later.  Here's the thing.  I went to court, and, you know, I was in and out of court for my dog. 
[00:27:30]  I mean, this dog was trouble.  And I show up with the short shorts and a tank top, and I'm holding my skateboard, right?  Because...  Yeah.  I was on a revoke list.  Were you a male prostitute?  Yeah, you sound like...  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, you sound like you were dressed like a male prostitute.  No.  Now you've got to explain, because that's what everyone else is thinking.  You wore the short shorts and a tiny little tank top for what?  To take advantage of who?  Well, back in my day, you know, I had an addictive personality, and certain people that 
[00:28:00]  would distribute, you know, that would help my addictive...  Sell you crack.  Drug dealers.  Stupid drug dealers.  Drug dealers.  Certain ones of them, you know, would like the way I looked.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Ooh.  So close.  No glance over that.  To curry the favor of drug dealers, you dressed sexy? 
[00:28:30]  You dressed sexy to get what?  A discount?  Well, you know, the guy...  Did you look in your drawer and stuff before and go, yeah, this is the one I've got to  wear for this drug dealer?  Would you wear no socks to make your calves look better?  He'd probably oil his legs up.  Yeah.  All right, now we've got to back up.  So where did you get the short shorts from without the pockets?  Because that's not like normal...  Probably cutoffs.  No, he says there's no pockets.  No, back in those days, those were like the basketball shorts that you would wear.  A little known fact, I spent most of my life playing basketball, and I played it 
[00:29:00]  in the era where you wore shorts that were a little short on the court.  They were never that short.  You don't remember?  They were like...  Some were like white, and they had like trim around them, like blue.  All right, so you would wear the short shorts and a tiny, tight tank top.  Yeah, yeah.  Because some of these drug dealers were attracted to you?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I was a cute little guy back then.  You know, I had long hair.  Look, we need the help today, but you're insane.  Like, I'm not going to forget this anytime soon. 
[00:29:30]  Well, it's not a big deal.  It was back in the day.  I let it go.  You know, it's not like, you know...  Does Bonnie know this?  No.  What do you mean?  I don't tell her all my stories.  Oh, she's not listening right now, right?  It would take forever.  It's like it's not going to get back to her or anything.  Another thing that was glanced over is the fact that because he was on the revoked list  and had a revoked license, he went from a car to a skateboard.  Yeah.  Like, isn't there a bicycle or something in between that you might...  Yeah, but...  A skateboard isn't good for transportation, really.  He probably sold the bike for crack, too. 
[00:30:00]  Ah, that's true.  Known this creep.  Yeah.  So, you show up at...  Creeps.  Yeah, how do you have any possessions if he's dressing up for the drug dealer in a curry favor?  Would you dress sexy...  Would you act sexy?  Would you, like, kind of flirt with him and crush your legs a certain way?  Well...  Yeah, let's get into this now, because you can't just blow up.  Did you sashay in?  Were you sashaying?  You would knock on the door with the short shorts and the tight tank top.  Yeah, we would go up there.  Would you wear makeup?  What else would you have on your body?  No, I didn't wear makeup.  I didn't have makeup.  I had my hair.  I had long hair.  Long, curly hair. 
[00:30:30]  Hi, it's Rich Voss, Daddy.  I'm coming over.  How addicted were you?  Oh, what do you want me to wear?  The little ones with the blue trim and a tank top.  All right, it'll take me a while.  Your place is uphill and I have a skateboard.  So, what happens?  You get there.  Well, I go there with other friends, right?  You know, one or two that, probably one that would have a car to get us there, because it's in another town. 
[00:31:00]  And I remember, you know, I guess if I sat certain ways...  Oh, no.  Are you kidding me?  So, if you would sit a certain way, like some old people sit on the beach sometimes, and you turn your head, and you get a look at, like, melted Turkish taffy.  So, were you wearing anything underneath the short shorts?  No.  Oh, God. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So, you'd sit a certain way.  Well, it was hot.  It was the summer.  No, it wasn't hot.  Oh, you meant temperature-wise.  Okay.  So, you found a drug dealer that was gay, bisexual.  What was the deal?  Something's going on there.  They were...  Both of them were gay.  You just appreciated...  You just appreciated the younger one, like me.  Young, rich.  Yeah, well, here's the thing.  The younger one, like me.  This is the deal.  Listen.  You're having an anxiety attack.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, you're kind of breathing heavy now and everything. 
[00:32:00]  You're like...  Here's the thing.  Because he's remembering the moment and getting all worked up.  Okay, here's how...  Don't worry.  There's not many people listening to us today.  So, no one will remember this.  Don't worry about it.  Listen, it doesn't matter.  All right.  So, you bang on the door.  They let you in.  You sit on the couch.  We went there one other time, and my friend Kevin, we went there, and the guy...  I think the guy's name was...  I don't remember the guy's name.  It was...  Whatever.  Let's say Tony, but it wasn't.  But I said to Kevin, oh, come upstairs, right?  So, you know, to his room. 
[00:32:30]  So, Kevin said, you know, okay.  It's all flustered.  So, the guy hit on my friend Kevin, but Kevin got extra stuff as the guy was hitting on him.  You know what I mean?  Oh, so you saw that happening.  So, Kevin told me about it, and, you know, a light bulb went on for the next time when I  would go over.  You know, why should Kevin be invited upstairs?  Stop with you and a light bulb.  I was just jealous.  I felt like a fat chick.  Yeah, you were the fat chick.  So, you had to start dressing sexier.  So, I said...  With Jim, it was just a match light over his head. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, Jim, rich.  I stink.  I was looking at Jim.  Jim.  Right experience, wrong guy.  You were the fat chick jealous of your hot friend.  Well, Kevin was a good-looking man.  So, you decided it worked well for him.  What did he have to do for his little extra?  He didn't do anything.  Kevin was...  He was just...  Kevin's just a...  So, what?  He would just, like, let me take a walk?  Oh, it's hot in here.  Let me take my shirt off.  Okay.  And just slowly take it off like a model does.  After the guy, I guess, hit on Kevin, Kevin said, no, I'm getting out of here. 
[00:33:30]  Well, then the next, you know, time we went over...  You're leaving something out because you said that Kevin got extra stuff.  Yeah.  Just for being him.  Just for being hot.  The guy would invite you upstairs.  Kevin was very good-looking.  I'm not going to lie.  You would go up...  The guy would invite you upstairs.  Every time you go over there, I guess...  But see, how would he get...  All right.  I understand.  He goes upstairs.  But how is he getting more if he's not doing anything?  Because I'm thinking if you're being invited upstairs and you're accepting the invite  that this guy is expecting something from Kevin. 
[00:34:00]  Now, Kevin's not giving anything up, but he's still getting extra stuff.  Well, he's getting it until he says no.  Yeah.  Probably a little incentive by the drug dealer guy.  And then, you know, maybe he can work it.  It's like a first date.  Yeah.  You know?  It's like you don't put too much pressure on him.  He gave up.  He gave up a little something.  It's like you're buying a gal drinks at a bar.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  I don't know if you're going home.  She might say no.  All right.  All right.  So now you realize this was going on with Kevin.  So you decided to make the trip upstairs looking tiny little shorts, nothing underneath. 
[00:34:30]  Rich gets in his sexy clothes.  The thought of this, the thought process and the whole procedure.  So Rich goes, yeah.  Okay, great.  Let me get in my sexy clothes.  Well, I had a nice little thin body back then.  I mean, I still do now.  But, you know, I was, listen, I had long hair.  I was.  Stop.  We've seen the videos.  Okay.  Look, he, you know.  The long hair was a jerry curled mess.  You know.  Yeah.  You know he looked in the mirror though.  This long hair could help me out.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to get me.  Like, like looking in the mirror, talking to himself.  I'm going to get me some dope tonight.  Yeah.  Oh, I look sexy.  So I remember, so we get to his house, the one time, and I have my shorts, nice little  tank top.  Nice little tank.  Don't try to talk it up to us.  And we're sitting there.  Yeah.  Like we're going to sit here and go, oh, I understand.  Oh, a nice little tank top. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I thought it was a sloppy one with some spaghetti stains.  So then the guy says, oh, I got to show you something.  Come upstairs.  And I'm like, oh.  And you're like, yes.  Here it comes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  Oh, he likes me.  Right?  It's like being asked to the prom.  Yeah.  I picked out the right outfit.  How excited were you that you pulled it off?  Like, yes.  Did you keep hinting about going upstairs?  Like, oh, you got more than one floor to this place?  And the guy wouldn't ask him up. 
[00:36:00]  How about that prude, Kevin?  So when I get up there, then he's, you know, he's got the mirror out, and he's, you know,  throwing all kinds of stuff out.  And then he, you know, he makes a pass.  And I go, oh, no.  And he had a Doberman pincher sitting by the door.  Oh, no.  This is Rich's excuse why he got into some action.  No, no, I didn't.  He was scared of the time.  What type of pass was made? 
[00:36:30]  You know, you don't glance over.  Yeah, don't glance over a pass.  What type of pass was made?  Well, I'm not going to say, you know, he said, you know, hey, I find you attractive or something.  Oh, did he?  Another guy says to another guy.  Did you giggle giddily?  I said, ooh.  Like a gentleman in 1950.  Did I find you attractive?  I find you attractive.  Did you run home and put it in your diary?  What is his diary?  He found me attractive. 
[00:37:00]  Dear diary.  Yes, an exclamation point, but there's no dot under it.  It's a heart.  Kevin isn't the only one that is considered sexy.  I got goosebumps.  All right.  And then he invited me upstairs.  You're a tramp.  Yeah, really.  You're a drug addict.  You little floozy.  You're a drug addict.  Hey, listen.  All right, so you go upstairs.  There's a dog.  There's a dog.  He's hitting on you.  The drugs are flying. 
[00:37:30]  So you're like, all right.  Now what?  You know.  And don't lie.  I'm not lying.  You're looking right at your eyes.  I would tell you something to happen.  I'm not going to lie.  Yeah.  Please, I'm not going to lie.  I know, at this point.  At this point?  Is he going to make it look manly by lying?  I told you what?  Me and my friend used to lay in bed and do things.  You know, I'm not going to lie.  It's not a big deal.  So the dog is there looking at you disgusted with your behavior as you're getting hit on.  Yes, and the dog, I think, had, you know, was kind of, had problems. 
[00:38:00]  And he said, you know, he might have, I think he might have even left the room and I might  have stole a little.  I don't know.  I might have.  I don't remember because I used to do that a lot too if I could.  Steal the drugs?  A little.  I remember.  I got millions of stories like that.  You don't get beat up for that.  That's not a big deal.  So, oh, they're going to beat me up there?  They would throw me out and just say, don't come back.  They're not going to beat me up.  Why?  Because you were so pretty?  Understanding drug dealers.  Because, like, you don't get beaten for stealing from them.  They just get the, like, you know, you're going to lose your frequent flight. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, what do they do?  Like, throw you out and then go, and stay out.  Right.  You're card counting.  They don't.  You know, so nothing happened.  He hit on me and then, you know, I think we walked downstairs and they said, you know.  Listen, why would I, would I bring up a story?  Well, the short, there's some, there's a piece of the film missing.  No, there's not.  A piece of the film.  He hit on you.  There's a rough edit done here.  Yeah, like Nicolas Cage. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  How'd you get out of it?  Because now, I mean, you gave him all the, you gave him all the signs.  You dressed sexy.  Yeah.  You went upstairs.  You know what happens when you go upstairs.  You kind of told you.  He hit on you.  And then, how does it go from, you're not accepting the hit and you're walking back downstairs hand  in hand.  You know what I mean?  Not hand in hand.  I made up a good lie, you know, or something.  I said, you know, I'm uncomfortable or I'm nervous or whatever.  I don't know.  Oh, it was just the drugs, baby. 
[00:39:30]  Did you negotiate, though?  Did you negotiate?  You're like, all right, I won't do that, but I'll do this.  No, no.  There was no contact whatsoever.  Look, we know you're in a great place with your life.  You've been drug-free for a long time.  21 years.  But something is going on that you're not telling us.  There's nothing going on.  I don't put it past him to have done some favors for drugs.  If you're going to dress like that and go upstairs, man.  Your only mode of transportation is a skateboard. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  There's desperation there.  You wouldn't believe.  Oh, you're like, I want the guy to co-sign for me.  I don't need to.  You know, it wasn't like I manipulated or scanned other deals.  He wanted to be a kept man.  That's funny.  And I think, you know, we went down.  So what kind of hitting on did he do?  Well, you know.  Did he touch your leg?  Was there anything?  Did he touch your arm or your leg or anything?  No, he went and probably, like, he laid on the bed, sprawled out.  Bed?  Well, I said the chair. 
[00:40:30]  Well, it was in his room.  Oh, you went to the bedroom?  Yes.  That's what you went to find people at.  Because most bedrooms have a chair.  A chair?  Yes.  What is this?  Grandma's room?  The chair.  You sat on the bed with him.  No, no, no.  Yes, you sat on the bed.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  All right.  At least admit that you sat on the bed.  No, I don't.  I don't.  No, no.  It didn't happen like that.  I don't know?  No, I don't remember.  It didn't happen.  I don't remember.  So he laid back on the bed.  What was he wearing?  Yeah, the Burt Reynolds pose. 
[00:41:00]  We'll go old school.  Yeah, Vosh is on his right arm, propped up.  All right.  So what is he wearing?  Just 20-something years.  He might have had a tank top, too.  Might have.  He was in his style back then, tank tops.  Tank top, too.  There was a tuft of hair coming out of the neckline.  I remember it.  So he laid back on the bed.  Did he have short shorts on, too?  Oh, God.  I'm trying to remember.  He wears short shorts.  I'm trying to remember. 
[00:41:30]  He had to see these shorts.  They were laid up.  He was narrowing his legs before he leaves to buy drugs.  He had to see.  And, you know, he's pouring out to, you know, and he probably said, you know, have you ever  been with a guy or something?  Yeah.  You know, because I was young then.  I was younger, too.  You know, I was.  You were 40.  I was.  That was wonderful.  Way back when.  Way back.  But then he kind of, like, brushed your shoulder or something?  He could have done something.  Could have done something.  All I know is nothing happened, but he did hit on me. 
[00:42:00]  That's.  You knew what he said.  Whatever you just described is something happening, by the way.  And fast forward 20 minutes.  It's like that Michael Douglas scene.  It was the movie when he peeks in at his daughters with the drug dealer.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Steve Voss pinned down with his eyes shut.  Yeah.  No.  He's got the name of the movie all of a sudden.  The sad thing is, because nothing's going to happen, because my other friends are there,  and all of us know that if you're invited upstairs.  Well, they're lined up downstairs like porkies.  By the way. 
[00:42:30]  Waiting.  A great feedback.  You get into the room.  Great feedback coming in.  A piece of film missing.  This is the Hindenburg footage without the blimp.  You are leaving out some huge chunks of this story.  We've been doing this a really long time.  Who are you kidding?  First of all, you were addicted, man.  You weren't thinking about, well, you know.  Listen, okay.  You didn't have any standards back then.  Okay, you're a radio host.  You're not interrogators or the FBI.  Really?  You'd be surprised.  Okay.  But we do know the difference between that and, like, here's the splice of film missing. 
[00:43:00]  All of a sudden, you're downstairs going, I sure would like to purchase some drugs,  and then there's, like, a sloppy edit, and you're walking out, tucking your tank top in.  You obviously were so desperate that you weren't driving anymore.  Your transportation was a skateboard.  You decided that short shorts would get you more drugs with nothing underneath, by the way,  and a tank top.  You know that going upstairs gets you more drugs.  Kevin went upstairs.  So you went upstairs.  You were desperate. 
[00:43:30]  So why are you also going to say, all of a sudden, go, ah, no?  I feel like I'm talking to John Douglas here.  Here's an FBI profiler.  And then if you, and then if, here's the other thing.  Can I have a coffee and a cigarette?  Here's the other thing.  If you say no to his advances, then this connection is going to dry up.  Well, no, that's not true.  That's, we're really not true, because.  You gave him enough so you could go back there and get more drugs. 
[00:44:00]  It's obvious.  Whether it's, whether you gave him a little show or did something else.  A little show.  So you were sitting on the chair, and you would sit a certain way so he would have a view?  Well, not a complete.  I'm not, but disgusting.  What's wrong with you?  I'm just saying, a view, like, you know, maybe the shorts.  Were the shorts, like, tight around your leg, or did it leave some opening and some slack?  Oh, no, it was opening.  There was no tightness.  I wish I had a picture of it.  Voss was giving Paris Hilton oopsies.  Oopsies.  The simple mind. 
[00:44:30]  A picture of that scene from True Lies.  Yeah.  Where all of a sudden, you know, like, he does a little dance for the drug dealer.  Oh, my God.  Now, take your clothes off.  Now, do a little dance for me.  Dude, you did some kind of negotiating.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  See, this all, first of all, maybe you didn't want to go all the way, but you did something,  because you didn't want this drug connection to dry up, because there would be such a disappointment 
[00:45:00]  that this dude didn't get anything from you except a look at your hot body and those short shorts.  Or maybe a peek at an oopsie.  Yeah, you did.  And a brush on the shoulder, on your bare shoulder from the tank top.  You did something.  In his bedroom.  You did something.  Listen, here's the thing.  If you remember looking back, if you went out with a hot girl on the first date or second date,  nothing happened, you wouldn't.  It's kind of a different situation, Rich.  Why?  Going out with a hot girl on a date and going up and wearing sexy outfits so you can garner favors 
[00:45:30]  from a drug dealer.  It's a little different.  And what problem did the dog have?  And be careful.  No, I don't know.  It just seemed, for a Doberman, he was a little wimpy and like, you know, he would just lay there.  It was kind of sad.  A Doberman is supposed to be...  So you didn't have any fear of the dog, so you could have left at any time.  No, I think the dog was looking at me going, let's get out of here together.  You know?  Oh, okay. 
[00:46:00]  Let's see where you might be going with that.  I don't know.  Let's go to Jesse.  Jesse, what do you have?  Hey, what's up, boys?  I bet you've lost it.  The drug dealer invited Tyra over and they had a panty party.  Yeah, did you have a panty party?  Panty party!  A panty party?  I put on my boy shorts.  Ah, well, Greg on Long Island has something to do.  Greg, what's up?  Hi.  Rich, did you wear long nails to make your stubby little fingers look longer?  I'm doing that right now.  Did he have press-on nails? 
[00:46:30]  Lee press-on nails.  You know what?  If he's admitting to this...  Yeah.  And we have been doing this long enough to know this much, Rich.  You're leaving something out.  And it's a good one.  I'm sure you're leaving out a sexy, juicy detail.  No.  Did you add fake boobies to your outfit?  Something.  Did he kiss your neck?  No.  Did he leave it?  You're like, let me tell you a secret.  You're like, yeah.  And you felt his lips brush your ear and your neck.  You just kind of giggle and pretend you didn't notice.  And I picture an awful, like, cheesy scene of incense burning and the room is a little dark. 
[00:47:00]  Maybe a lava lamp or one of those multicolored lights that spin around from the heat of the bulb.  What's that Watchtower song from Hendrix playing?  Yeah, yeah.  Just an awful scene.  This cheesy hack scene.  The Fly United poster, but it's, you know, it's two roosters.  There's the melting face drug guy on there and black light, light going.  I used to have those black lights.  And one more thing as far as this scenario goes.  What?  He might have put his hand on my leg. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Well, now we got to touch it.  He might have.  He might have.  Maybe a hand on the leg.  And he stopped there, right?  Because you're saving yourself for marriage.  Yeah.  Dear diary.  You know, I'm just going back tonight.  Let you know what happens later.  Right.  It's on YouTube.  It's Lonely Girl 48.  Do you want to kiss me? 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  He's making little videos in his little bedroom.  Dear diary.  So back to the point.  My first date with the drug lord went very well.  Drug lord?  I'm talking to Susie and trying to figure out if I should give it up or not.  Going to have to sneak out of my parents' house to have a second date with the drug lord.  Hand on the knee.  Is he courting you for marriage? 
[00:48:30]  A drug dealer does that.  You know what?  Make an awful offer.  Trying to seduce Voss.  First of all, he wasn't like some gangster drug dealer.  He was, you know, he loves the local guy, huh?  Well, he wasn't like, you know, I mean, I guess he likes having plenty.  So he touched you inappropriately.  Yeah, but it wasn't like, you know, he probably put his hand in, hey, you know.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, what do you need?  He's like, all right, this guy's easy.  I don't have to, like, pull out too many tricks.  You know, you're like a drug dealer slut, is what you are. 
[00:49:00]  That's what you are.  Voss was the first guy that actually tried to get upstairs.  Most of them would resist it and go reluctantly.  Yeah.  Voss just stood up and showed at the foot of the stairs and was like.  I brought a ladder to his house.  Like, what about me?  Do you have a duvet?  I'd like to see it.  Rich, and I play golf with you.  Yeah.  Does he pat you on the butt when you have a good drive?  No, this is, I guess, I just want to ask. 
[00:49:30]  Do you look back at all this like it's a completely different life, like a completely different person?  Oh, of course.  Yeah, I mean, you know, you do certain things.  I mean, I didn't, but you act certain ways or do certain things.  You know, you have one goal in life, and that's to party or to get on.  But do you look back and you have really no concept of that Rich Voss?  Like, you're like, wow, I did all that?  No, because here's the thing.  All the stuff I've done in life brought me to where I am now. 
[00:50:00]  It gave me the knowledge.  That's the rationalization of the whole thing.  Well, yeah, of course you go, wow.  You might have been in an even better position right now if you didn't do that.  Do you ever think of that one?  Everyone that says that, what I've been through is hard, but at least it brought me to where I am now.  You could have been an astronaut, idiot.  You know?  You went to school and stayed there and did good.  Like, that's a good argument if you're Bill Gates.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Sumbles on my parts.  Everything that I went through.  Yeah, you're Bill Gates in the garage building computers, whatever.  You know, everything I went through. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it seems like another life, but here I am in my Seattle mansion or whatever it is.  And there's Rich.  It caught me to where I am now on this show.  I mean, come on.  No, as a stand-up being, you know, a brilliant comic that has experienced a lot.  Like, a great comic has experienced enough of life.  Can you stop throwing adjectives in front of yourself?  Great comic.  A brilliant comic, a great comic.  Instantly, like, Eddie Murphy popped in my head.  Richard Pryor.  No, if, listen to me. 
[00:51:00]  And I, as a comic, you know, I'm brilliant.  You know that.  But here's the thing.  To become a great comic or a great anything, musician, artist, it's from experience in life.  I want to karate kick him in the stomach.  Oh, my God.  I said you can't lift your leg.  Here's the thing, tubby.  I want to kick him.  I want to do a lot of things, but this is what's holding me back.  Okay.  My food addiction.  I want to do a lot.  Well, at least I never went to the supermarket broke and asked the butcher to rub my legs. 
[00:51:30]  For an extra burger, stupid.  All right, we got to take a break.  Rich, what the F?  We'll be back with the drug whore.  Dear diary, he likes me.  He really likes me.  You had me at how much do you need?  Did you have flowers that you just would play with in your room?  He loves me.  He loves me not. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, you're despicable.  My life.  Listen.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, well, whatever.  It brought you here, Rich.  What I'm saying, you know.  People are saying you're Julian from Less Than Zero.  That is a great reference, Jay, in Boston.  At least now, yeah.  That's where I'm going to be in Providence, Rhode Island this weekend.  That's right by Boston, isn't it?  Sure.  When?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  I mean, I meant to say where.  Where?  Catch a Rising Star in Providence. 
[00:52:30]  Very good.  More with Rich Voss.  We'll talk about our comic tour.  I think he's willing to give up a little more as far as the story goes.  We got him to the point where now he's admitting there was some touching going on.  A little touching.  Might as well just admit it.  Then we can move on.  I mean, I promise you, admit it.  We'll just move on.  Instead of trying to get it out of you for the next hour.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I love showing my introverted fat guys to whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.

[00:53:30]  Get your WOW stickers on your cars and your trucks.  I see a lot of WOW stickers these days.  And there are ladies out there that will flash you.  It's been happening for many years.  Rich Voss in studio.  We got a little song for you, Rich.  Man, dig that crazy chick.  Oh, we're short, short. 
[00:54:00]  We're short, short.  There's a...  Hello, I'm coming over.  I need an eight ball.  Which ones?  The blue ones with the trim?  Okay.  A tank top.  Did you practice walking like a girl?  Do you want my hair up or down?  I got high heels I could wear.  It makes my calves look good.  And I got a unicorn t-shirt.  I can wear my hair and braids for you. 
[00:54:30]  I used to wear the braids down the side.  No, you didn't.  Yeah.  You remember that look?  No.  No.  I don't.  Well, you don't.  Instead of the ponytail, the braid on each side.  Kind of like...  When was this a look?  Back in the day.  I mean...  The day.  Yeah, back in the day.  You know, I used to have...  Or I had a big, gigantic afro in school. 
[00:55:00]  But then I had...  Well, the whole story started about jail.  And I'll tell you, I went into the courtroom wearing my short shorts and my skateboard.  Oh, right.  I was...  That's where we were.  I was there because I got pulled over again in my car or my dog.  Wait, you got pulled over wearing your short shorts?  No, no, no, no.  This is a different...  While I was in court.  While you were in court.  No.  While I was in court.  But this was the dog story.  Or something.  Whatever.  Rich wears short shorts. 
[00:55:30]  Rich wears short shorts.  There's a short shorts.  So you're in court.  So I'm in court.  I don't usually work with background music.  I...  I should.  All right, yeah.  So I'm standing there and the judge...  Hold on, I got a little water.  The judge.  Oh, judge is a tough one for him.  Yeah.  The guy running the courtroom. 
[00:56:00]  He just lost a tooth on that.  The matador.  What do they call it?  Whatever.  Oh, no.  He tried to say magistrate.  The matador.  He's bullfighting.  The magistrate.  You know, they call my name.  And I walk up holding the skateboard to my side.  Yeah.  And this is no lie.  The judge was my first cousin.  On the other side was related to him.  You know, but he's not related to me.  On the other side, like... 
[00:56:30]  Whatever.  No.  Okay.  Some type of relative?  Not really, but related to a relative.  Oh, okay.  So I walk up there.  He goes, how dare you come into my courtroom like this?  And I'm like a wise guy.  I go, you know, I'm playing hoops.  You know, I didn't even realize I had a, you know, court date.  I'm in a game right now or something.  I was like, you know, I'm playing ball.  Did he know he was related to you?  Yeah.  He knew, but they didn't like me.  Even my first cousins, their family, no one really liked me.  No one liked you. 
[00:57:00]  Good.  Just leave it at that.  No one liked you.  Like my uncle used to come over and, you know, they would try to discipline me.  Like they didn't like my family.  They didn't like my family.  Sounds worse.  They didn't like my family and they hated me the worst out of the family.  You know what I mean?  So how dare you come into my courtroom?  Then he says to me, he goes, whatever I was in here for, he said, okay.  I, uh, uh, six or no, he said eight weekends in county jail.  Right.  Eight weekends?  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Weekends.  For driving with a revoked license?  Yeah.  Because I was on the revoked list.  Because I was in and out and I, he's, uh, this time I was in, now it hits me.  This time I was in there and I didn't have, you know, I was in and out for a revoked list  and I was back on and I didn't have my insurance card in the car or whatever.  Not, not insurance.  Right.  And he, he goes, I'm sick of seeing you.  You know, I was in and out there with my dog and driving and stuff.  He said eight weekends in county jail.  Right.  And right then, like a tear. 
[00:58:00]  Did you start crying?  A tear came down.  Oh no.  A tear and I'm in my shorts with my, and it's just like, it's like almost all the power  was just taken out.  You know, it was completely like, it's like when they say, well, we're not picking up  your TV show.  You know what I mean?  Only a little worse.  You cry during that too?  Yeah.  Many.  Yes.  You know, and it's here.  Rich cries at pitch meetings.  And I said, I don't think it's going well.  Yeah.  As he sits there in his short shorts.  Pitch meetings. 
[00:58:30]  This is a show.  Wow.  So, so he, I said, but, but I wasn't, I did have insurance.  He said, I'll give you a day to prove it.  You know, I guess you go to your insurance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we'll suspend the sentence.  It suspended the sentence.  What kind of punishment is that?  So I, I got the proof and that was, you know, I almost spent eight weekends in county.  In county, they say it could be worse than prison. 
[00:59:00]  So this is an almost in jail story.  Well, I had the, I had the, we got the short shorts.  Thank God we got that out of it.  But, but he was actually starting with an, I almost went to jail story.  Well, here's the thing.  I talked about spending nights in city jail.  You know, I talked about that.  I talked about, you know, things that led to whatever, you know, and I've watched every  prison movie there ever was pretty much.  I mean, I watched that.  Oh, so you did.  I know, but I read books on prison. 
[00:59:30]  The Hot House is one of the best prison books you could ever read.  It's about Leavenworth.  I know I've driven past prisons and I stop and look at them.  So this is your experience.  So, so the bottom line, when you first came in here, because we heard you had prison stories.  Prison experience, basically, yeah.  It was, you almost went to county and you've driven past prisons and watched prison movies.  Do you understand that makes you about as much an expert as everybody?  No.  I know, I've seen a lot of, I've read a lot of prison books and I've had friends. 
[01:00:00]  Fiction or like?  No.  Fantasy.  You'd see Cool Hand Luke.  Well, one, a great prison movie is the one with Tom Selleck, An Innocent Man.  That's a good one.  Lockup was okay.  But dude.  Great movie with Tom Selleck.  That was a little bit.  Yeah, a great prison movie.  You could talk about other great prison movies without bringing up Tom Selleck.  Well, he probably finds them sexy.  Oh, maybe. 
[01:00:30]  Probably reminds them of the drug deal.  Wow.  That porn mustache that Tom Selleck had.  Nice mustache, the 70s mustache.  See, Rich.  That's how they wore it in a day.  When, I don't know, I'll just speak for everybody in the studio here.  When we think prison films, we don't think about Tom Selleck.  We think about the prison babe films.  Yeah.  Eat.  Laundry room.  Right, right.  Did you ever see Short Eyes?  Short Eyes.  Short Eyes, no.  About the tombs in New York.  Ooh, good prison movie. 
[01:01:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  The holding cells in New York?  Yeah.  What, was it a documentary?  I don't remember.  He doesn't remember if it was a documentary or a drama?  No, it was a good...  You're talking about prison films and you don't know the difference between...  Was it a cartoon?  I didn't say I didn't know the difference.  I don't know.  I said I don't remember.  Or how about the one where Robbie...  I spent the night there.  That's why I want to know.  I was in the tomb.  Oh, really?  That's why I want to know if it's a documentary.  He spent the night in the tomb.  I know, from the bus.  I know you spent the night in the tomb.  Don't bring up a Robbie Benson movie and tell me that was good.  You didn't see that prison movie with Vic Morrow and Robbie Benson threw himself off 
[01:01:30]  the upper deck of the prison after Vic Morrow...  No.  Oh.  What happened?  What happened?  Vic Morrow cheated in cards and Benson couldn't handle it.  Vic Morrow went to get a haircut and then he realized it was a helicopter blade?  What are you talking about?  You know the movie with Vic Morrow and the prison movie and...  No.  He was...  I don't think I've ever watched a Robbie Benson movie.  Yeah.  You got to look...  It's a good movie.  He was like the prison leader.  He was like the gang. 
[01:02:00]  Robbie Benson?  No, no.  Vic Morrow.  Oh, Vic Morrow.  Tough guy.  Vic Morrow.  He was a tough guy.  And, you know, he took Robbie into the cell.  And Robbie Benson wore his short shorts.  And Robbie, you know...  Oh, was Robbie like his bitch or something in prison?  I guess.  Wow.  And he just heaved himself off.  Well, and dudes I grew up with, I'm talking, you know, spent...  Get some new techniques from that movie?  Was that a TV movie from the 70s or something?  What the hell are you talking about?  All right.  So, but dudes I went to...  I grew up with, you know, did time in Broadway and stuff.  And they would come out and tell stories, you know. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  We'd all sit...  So, I mean, you know, this is as close to prison stories as you're going to get from  you guys, you know.  All right.  Thanks, Rich.  Yeah.  All right.  Squeaky.  Bravo.  Oh, just push me out now.  No.  Yeah.  No.  You can sit there.  Just shut up.  You earned your stay.  I want to say good morning to West Palm Beach.  We got a fine clip from West Palm Beach.  This news reporter.  Yeah.  This is hilarious.  A news reporter is doing his thing.  Reading.  That's all they do.  The reading of the teleprompter. 
[01:03:00]  That's pretty much all they do, especially on local news.  And then...  They don't really have a thought.  Their job is to pretty much look good and read.  And when the reading machine breaks down, you see what these guys are really about.  Turns into Lord of the Flies.  Yeah.  They don't know what the hell they're up to or what they're doing.  SNL did a brilliant skit on that.  Remember?  They were doing like a mock, like Regis and Kelly type show.  And the reading machine breaks down.  And by the end of it, they're making fires.  All right.  They're trying to survive in the studio. 
[01:03:30]  Killing each other.  Yeah.  Just brilliant, man.  But here's a real example of that out of West Palm Beach, Florida.  A local man spots something suspicious and that he decides to spring into action.  He has done something that is very good.  Geez, can you tell right when it breaks?  And he has done something very good.  He did something good. 
[01:04:00]  Good.  People good did it.  Good thing the guy wasn't a murderer.  And he was a bad man.  Bad.  Bad man.  Kill thing.  Bad man.  Dirt.  So, yeah.  Let's play this again so you can see where the reading machine breaks down.  And then, finally, they get the reading machine back up and he gets back on fire.  Sounds all official.  And then it just falls apart.  They did something good.  He's going to get a cold start for that. 
[01:04:30]  A local man spots something suspicious and that he decides to spring into action.  He has done something that is very good.  Port St. Lucie police need to know if you have seen anything of the man who exposed himself  to several women and children.  They released this composite sketch.  So, the guy that exposed himself to children did something good?  Like, now I'm confused because he went off script.  Yeah, he didn't know what he was talking about.  He did something good. 
[01:05:00]  Used to be, I guess, they could go right to the copy in front of him and read that.  Like, Walter Cronkite, there was a professional.  But these guys, once that reading machine, the reading machine.  I like to call it the rating machine.  What do we do?  Yeah.  I want to know why Dell is being sued for fraud.  Dell?  Yeah, I just saw that on Good Morning America.  There's a woman here talking about Dell.  And I don't know why.  It's not giving you any details written. 
[01:05:30]  But I would love to know why they're being sued for fraud.  I don't know.  Fraud?  Well, I have a Dell and it is a computer.  Well, I don't know.  Excuse me.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Nickelodeon.  Aw, cartoons!  Except, hey, keep her on.  Yeah.  Jill Nicolini.  Jill Nicolini.  We're all about Jill Nicolini. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Anyway, we're going to take a break.  Rich Voss here playing in Providence over the weekend?  Yes.  Rhode Island.  Catch the rising star.  And Jimmy's going to be in Nashville?  I just booked another local gig.  I had it booked.  Stress Factory Memorial Day weekend.  It's my last performance weekend before HBO.  Oh.  Advertisers on this program, the Stress Factory?  See it before he takes off.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  Ha, ha.  Vinny's Joy.  That's 4, 2, 4, 2.  But Vinny realized that that would be ha, ha.  So that became part of the number. 
[01:06:30]  I like Vinny's Joint.  It's a comedy club.  You know what the bad thing about giving out numbers with letters in them nowadays,  and I've noticed I've done this, is because of texting.  Yes.  You, instead of writing ha, ha, and you just have to hit the number,  or you go for the, like, H or one of the letters there,  you hit the number three times.  Oh, you're right.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to get a phone so I don't look like an idiot and pick a letter that's like the first one. 
[01:07:00]  Well, H would be the second tap.  Yeah, H would be the second tap.  So instead of, like, ha, ha would be 4, 2, 4, 2.  Yes.  So that's what you would do.  4, 2, 4, 2.  But you would do 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2.  Yeah.  Yeah, because of texting.  Right.  Texts so much it screws you up.  Okay, you're right.  Little tidbit.  So 5, 4, 5, 4, 2, 4, 2.  Which is ha, ha, ha.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony and I came up with something years ago. 
[01:07:30]  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Great.  Whoa.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 Free FM.  Free FM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss in studio. 
[01:08:00]  And Rich is going to be part of the One Traveling Virus comedy tour.  Another year of the comedy tour kicks off.  Last year, we did four dates.  This year, we're doing seven, possibly eight.  And tickets are going very, very, very well through Ticketmaster.com.  Do we know, we haven't talked much this year about the village and stuff like that.  Like, what, last year, like, almost every venue had a village in it.  Where the pets do weird stuff and different booths just set up and all that crap. 
[01:08:30]  What do we, do we, anybody know any details on the village here?  Well, the drunken clown's coming back.  He was a huge hit last year.  That guy.  Bill Burr picked him at OzFest, actually, one year.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  Although, we didn't get the actual drunken clown.  Yeah, we found out he's like a franchise.  It's a franchise, yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah, so the guy that Bill Burr saw with a, ah, and the good insults and everything,  he wasn't the same guy.  He's like Gallagher's brother.  Goes out and makes like he's Gallagher. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, here's...  As long as he smashed the watermelon at the end.  These guys have security when they go to the fairs.  Yeah.  They piss off people to the point that people really want to hurt them.  And so they got security.  And we got a drunken clown for the ONA Village.  Now, the ONA Village, for the people that don't know about our comedy tour,  it's not just a comedy tour.  The show itself, in some cities, was close to three hours of comedy.  Yep.  And people stayed right to the end laughing their asses off. 
[01:09:30]  It's eight or nine comedians you know and love from the show.  Ant and I doing our thing in between comics, and it's just a very festive, festive show.  And that's after hours of tailgating in the parking lot.  Well, it starts with the tailgating.  The O&A Pest get the tailgating together.  They get very excited.  They figure all that out on their own, and they go to the venue, and they set up beer pong and just barbecues.  You know, just picture a sporting event, a picture for a comedy show. 
[01:10:00]  So don't you hate, though, when you – because we cruise through in the golf cart, and we hang out with a few of the people.  We stop if we see a big, like, tent that people have set up.  And don't you hate, though, when someone hands you this half-drank warm beer?  Here, man, have one.  Like, no.  No.  First of all, I don't want to hit the stage seeing tracers and, like, trails.  Do you have a cold one that's not open?  Yeah, could you not open – do not open the beer for me. 
[01:10:30]  I can do it myself.  I don't know what you put in it.  Do you realize the guys you listen to are very paranoid?  They don't want anything that's already open.  And here's the other thing.  They get insulted, too, because you don't drink every beer given to you.  It's like, can you – just please do the math.  Hey.  If we drank every beer that was handed to us –  I try.  Yeah, you do a good job.  You do a good job.  Give it a whirl.  Actually, I was going around with my stupid wine glass on the back of it.  They wanted to cram it.  So then the tailgating gets kicked off very, very early. 
[01:11:00]  And then they enter into the ONA Village where there's bands playing.  You've got the drunk clown.  And we're still getting the village together, actually.  Do we know anything what the pets are doing?  Because I've dug in those guys who were involved in doing something last year.  They've got a bunch of people.  It was actually very funny.  They put, like, a little feeding area with hay in it.  Well, we had Pet the Pest, and then they just had a horrific game set up.  They kind of take it upon themselves to make their own area.  We give them kind of free reign.  Well, we'll give them another booth this year. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  And then some of the sponsors are there doing their thing.  I know Pal Talk will probably be there again.  We're on Pal Talk right now, by the way.  I want to say hi to everyone watching us this morning.  Oh, Jimmy's waving.  Yeah, so then the village is good.  Think Lollapalooza.  Think OzFest.  There's things to buy.  There's things to sign up for.  There's things just to check out.  And then we march into the venue, and we do, you know, two to three hours of comedy.  And Camden, they had an open mic stage in the village in Camden. 
[01:12:00]  And then after the show, we hang out with the fans for a minimum of two hours and sign everything in sight.  It's so funny last year.  It's an all-day event.  Last year when everybody was signing, I mean, the line went forever.  And I kind of like snuck off maybe to go relax.  And there's all these people.  And you guys, I don't know who it was, but security is dragging me back to the table going, if we can't leave.  Patrice ratted me out. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, it had nothing to do with the fact that anyone wanted Rich's autograph.  We were just pissed that he was able to go.  It was fun watching your sign, taking your little hands and using both of them to hold that big marker.  It's really a cool experience.  God, is it fun.  It's just an all-day event.  It's just so much fun.  I love the homemade O&A shirts that are made.  It's just the whole thing that goes on.  I poked my head out, actually, and watched some of that open mic thing.  It was really weird to watch.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Just bombing? 
[01:13:00]  Awful.  But it was fun to watch.  I mean, guys just up there just eating it and sucking.  And I think Fan hosted it.  Wasn't it somebody from our show hosted it?  I believe so.  Remember when we used to do that open mic together in the – it was a coffee shop.  The Laughing Bean.  The Laughing Bean in Red Bank.  The Laughing Bean, and it was a coffee shop.  Yeah.  You know, because coffee and jokes together.  Party har-har.  That's where me and Norton kind of like bonded.  We kind of – well, we first met on a one-nighter or something.  Vinny was on the show, too, with us.  Did he like your short shorts? 
[01:13:30]  Klaus is just – he's the worst first impression maker ever.  The worst.  We do a gig, and it was in North Brunswick, actually, which was my hometown at the time.  And I was getting 50 bucks for the gig.  Nice.  And I was so scared to perform.  Fifty dollars.  Righteous bucks.  I was so scared to perform back in those days because I just was going to bomb.  So I wanted shows to get canceled.  Like, I would be happy when there'd be two people.  They're like, yes, we don't have to do it tonight.  I was scared.  Isn't that odd?  I didn't want to bomb.  So it was me and stupid Vinny and Voss was headlining. 
[01:14:00]  And the guy's like, look, I'll give you guys each 50 bucks to cancel the show.  And I'm like, okay.  And Voss is like, look, pal, this isn't a hobby.  Which I respect it.  That is good.  I respect it.  The guy gave us each 50 bucks.  And Voss goes –  This isn't a hobby.  And Voss says to me, you're lucky.  We're giving you 50.  That's all you were supposed to get anyway.  What?  Some of these club owners, they act like, you know, comedy.  So insignificant, right? 
[01:14:30]  The other day –  So what?  So insignificant.  The other day I was doing – listen, I was –  Did you say Igg or –  Did you just say Igg significant at first?  No, because he makes up consonants I've never heard before.  Igg significant it was, yeah.  I love you, Voss.  You're making me sound like I speak well.  I was at a banquet hall.  Speak good.  Speak good.  And on Monday we did a golf tournament, right?  They raised money for Little League.  And, you know, Spring Lake, one of the richest cities in New Jersey.  You know, people are dying of diseases, floods, and they're raising money so Billy can get a new bat, you know, for Little League. 
[01:15:00]  So we get there.  We play the golf tournament.  And then we go to do the show at the banquet.  The owner of the place – this is why people do not respect comics.  The owner says, I have a little problem.  There's no sound system.  Oh, really?  That would be a little problem for the chef, okay?  For me, that's a big problem because I'm the comic, okay?  That would be a little problem for a valet that the sound system doesn't work.  But –  You need a sound – what, are you going to yell? 
[01:15:30]  You know, like I'm the core jester.  I'm going to get up and dance at a golf tournament, okay?  We need a sound system.  And like the owner says, like club owners back then, even still now, would say, well, there's not enough people.  We're not doing a show.  And, you know, he would settle.  But, you know, back then, if that place was packed, he wouldn't have gave us extra money either.  Yeah, you don't get extra.  We don't get extra when it's packed.  It's the same thing with bands.  When I used to play in bands, the club owners were constantly trying to screw the bands over.  You know how many people you brought today? 
[01:16:00]  It's like, what?  I'm here to entertain the people that come into your bar.  That's pretty much it.  We're not, you know, we're not Guns N' Roses.  Yes.  We don't have a name like Guns N' Roses.  You know that.  You're not even a good rat.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's not like, you know, the people are going to come in.  We're going to draw some people, but it's not going to be the place that's going to be mobbed because of us.  If you didn't have a crappy club that smelled like stale beer and crap, perhaps there'd be more people in here. 
[01:16:30]  Then you entertain the people that come in there.  You're the musician.  You're not the promotion department.  Yeah, you're supposed to promote.  I told you, I probably said this on here.  I took a guy's TV.  He didn't have my money after the show.  I took his TV.  You know, I said, I'm not going home with nothing.  Why would you take someone's transvestite?  Throw it over his shoulder.  I dress like you to get drunk.  All right.  So there.  So you're going to be part of the comedy tour.  Rich, you were awesome last year.  Thank you.  I want to know just when they start getting ideas, I would like them to tell us so we can start promoting the ideas because, you know, we're always open to have the fans. 
[01:17:00]  Well, we're supposed to have a meeting with Pete and just start figuring all this stuff out.  We're a month out.  I think a month from today is our first date, June 16th at Jones Beach out there in Long Island.  We're very excited about that date because Anthony and I are from Long Island.  We haven't done anything on Long Island in a long time.  Long time.  And the ticket sales are great for Jones Beach especially. 
[01:17:30]  And it's eight or nine comedians including Stephen Lynch, Bob Saget, Bob Kelly, Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Frank Kelly, and no, just did the whole lineup for the Jones Beach show.  Tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  And then we're playing Mohegan Sun, June 30th.  Very excited about that show.  We love the casino atmosphere.  And tickets going fast for that show because they got 2,000 comps.  2,000 comps?  Yeah.  2,000 comps.  And you know how much Jimmy loves comps. 
[01:18:00]  For the gamblers.  Jimmy loves comps.  Eight comps.  Nothing better than the first five rows being empty.  It's the worst, Tom, because we were talking about yesterday.  There's got to be a way around that, man.  Yeah, you just tell them no comps in the first – for HBO, I'm not doing that.  I'm just like – because they'll be full anyway.  Yeah.  And I'm like, I love my family and friends.  None of them I want to see within the first 20 rows.  The only comps I want that are – the only people I want within 20 rows is you guys if you decide to go, which of course I –  Why would I go?  If you're being – I don't know.  I, of course, want to see Jimmy. 
[01:18:30]  You're the only guys I want to –  I don't want to see my parents.  I don't want to see anybody I know.  I just, you know.  Yeah, you don't like that?  I don't know.  It throws you a lot.  No.  It does not.  Have you seen my act?  How do you look at your mother after saying the thing I'm awful?  That's true.  I've been practicing my stand-up and wave.  Oh, that's going to be the –  And I don't mean stand-up as in comedy.  I mean, as Jim Norton goes, my good pals Opie and Anthony are in the audience, and then I stand up and wave.  I made a complete ass of myself. 
[01:19:00]  If I may quote.  I've been practicing.  Yeah, and did the curtsy or I don't know.  What the hell did you do?  It wasn't a curtsy.  What is it called?  It was –  The hand over the hand over the hand over the hand over the hand.  It was sort of like you would – I don't know.  You made a wave machine with your right hand as you were, like, acknowledging Jimmy.  What do you call that?  17th – awful.  It was a 17th century type of a –  Yeah.  Of a bow.  I made an ass of myself.  Yes, I did.  And it became – it was a whack bag.  They just kept looping it. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, I – it's like one of those – like you'd see in a – in front of a king, how you would bow before a king.  Right.  You kind of bow your head and take your arm and sort of circle it a little bit as you bow down and –  Over and over again.  Right, like this.  Yes, yes.  Your hand goes round and round.  I bring a noose in the north.  Right, exactly.  And I just got hammered for that.  Oh, they played it over and over.  And whenever I've seen the HBO special on HBO, I flip through the channels and I go, oh, it's Jimmy, you know? 
[01:20:00]  And he goes, and I'd like to, you know, thank my good friends Opie and Anthony.  And I go, oh, I look at myself and the stupid wave I gave.  I thought it was very good.  You know what's weird?  HBO made Ant and I, like, sit together and our chicks had to be, like, out of the picture.  We're – like we're a couple or something.  Yeah, it – it's like –  Dan says it would be the perfect bow if I had a hat in my other hand with a feather in it. 
[01:20:30]  That would – tucked under my arm.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  And that's what I want –  Your Highness, I bow to you.  I want to film for DVD extras.  I want to film YouTube practicing your waves.  We will not have another special ruined with bad waves.  There you go.  Good wave.  Just give the Queen's wave, the little twist to the wrist maybe.  I'm just going to give the finger to Jimmy.  I like that.  That would be great. 
[01:21:00]  All right, anyway, so Mohegan Sun, June 30th, ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Then we go to the Tweeter Center for everyone in the Boston area.  Mansfield, of course.  Carlos Mencia is on that day with pretty much all the other comedians I just announced.  Remember, eight or nine comedians at every show or two, four – yeah,  eight or nine.  Then we go to Detroit, our first time in Detroit.  We can't wait.  The show is brand new in Detroit.  But we've got a nice little buzz so far in Detroit,  so we're looking forward to seeing all the new listeners up there.  That's August 4th.  Then we've got Washington area, Nissan Pavilion, Bristow, Virginia, August 18th. 
[01:21:30]  PNC, of course, once again this year, August 25th for everybody in the Jersey area.  And then, of course, the Tweeter Center once again in Camden, New Jersey,  for everybody in the Philly area, September 15th.  That show is, what, four months out?  Yeah, we forget sometimes that we really are a long ways away from some of these shows.  Even the first one is a month from now.  Yeah, still a month.  Ticketmaster.com.  Where's the info for the tour there, E-Rock? 
[01:22:00]  E-Rock?  Oh, E-Rock.  What?  MySpace.com slash VirusTour.  Get on mic, where?  I know the one time we want to hear from you.  MySpace.com slash VirusTour.  Wait, say it again.  I swear to God, your mic cracked out.  I had nothing to it.  Go ahead.  MySpace.com slash VirusTour.  All right.  There you go.  Drinks his water.  All right.  He's the most uncomfortable man on a microphone I've ever seen in my life.  Bud Dwyer was more comfortable in front of a crowd than stupid Eric. 
[01:22:30]  You should disguise it as a giant hot dog.  Hey, we got audio.  We got audio.  BBC reporter versus a Scientologist.  The BBC.  BBC was doing a report on Scientology, and I guess the news guy made the mistake of calling it a cult.  Yeah.  The Scientologist got really, really mad, and then with a fine twist, the news reporter let him have it.  Just opens up on the guy.  The Scientology guy sounds like kind of a little wimpy guy, but he gets like...  Like, he got his dander up. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  He was all angry.  And the news reporter's like...  Yeah, the news reporter's like, all right, here we go.  I'm going to fire one at you.  So here we go.  BBC reporter John Sweeney talks to Scientology spokesperson Tommy Davis and pisses him off.  Some people say it's a sinister cult.  Now, L. Ron Hubbard.  Some people say that he's a fantasist and a liar.  I want to just go back to this.  You see, I would just like to, and I hope somebody is shooting this.  Okay, good.  Well, there's actually, to be fair, there's one camera from the BBC, one camera from your... 
[01:23:30]  No, you listen to me for a second.  You have no right whatsoever to say what and what isn't a religion.  The Constitution of the United States of America guarantees one's right to practice and believe freely in this country.  And the definition of religion is very clear.  And it's not defined by John Sweeney.  And for you to repeatedly refer to my faith in those terms is so derogatory, so offensive, and so bigoted. 
[01:24:00]  And the reason you keep repeating it is because you wanted to get a reaction like you're getting right now.  Well, buddy, you got it.  Right here, right now.  Buddy.  I'm angry.  Real angry.  Very good.  So we're done.  Has anyone ever been scared in their life when you hear someone say, I'm angry.  Real angry.  Real angry.  Well, you got it, bucko.  That guy sounds like the least threatening guy ever.  I would openly laugh in the guy's face.  As much as I don't like the Scientologist guy, the reporter annoys me more because he's trying to go to... 
[01:24:30]  And then the guy's like, well, are we filming this?  And the reporter, instead of just going, yeah, has to just keep talking.  Well, yeah, there's a camera over there.  There's a camera over there.  Uh, yeah.  Check him out.  I like how the guy starts quoting the, um, uh, we, we have, uh, what, a constitution?  What did he say?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's not defined by you.  It's defined by the U.S. Constitution.  So we have the freedom to practice our faith.  Yeah.  Like an English guy wants to hear about our constitution.  He doesn't care.  And when did Scientology start? 
[01:25:00]  Only, uh...  Uh, very...  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to say probably, uh, bah...  On a Wednesday.  Yeah.  On a Wednesday.  And it's got some legitimacy.  I'm, I'm wondering what other religions have started that are still trying to get known.  Chug up some...  Right.  Well, there was one little one that thought there was a spaceship behind a comet.  Oh, yeah.  Go remember those guys.  Was that Marshall White Apple?  Yeah.  And they all...  Marshall White Apple.  ...all castrated themselves and put on Nikes.  Nikes.  Nikes.  They covered themselves, uh, in, like, bunk beds.  Right?  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  And then, uh, killed themselves.  A bunch of silikies.  What about, uh, Mooney?  Reverend Moon?  Yeah, what happened to him?  Uh...  Remember that?  Reverend Moon, he used to have those mass weddings.  He just marries people.  Yeah.  He had a church, right, by the garden, right?  Yeah.  Didn't he have a...  There was, yeah.  Yeah, the Moonies used to be out all over the place.  They kind of went away, huh?  I don't know.  I'm talking about the...  I'm talking about the brand new ones.  Hare Krishnas?  Are there Hare Krishnas anymore still?  Because they used to be at the airports and stuff?  I'm imagining...  I think Chuck Palahniuk could start a religion. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  You watch.  Give it a few more years.  Scientology, 1952.  Thank you.  50...  I was going to say 55.  Yeah.  Well, L. Ron Hubbard was a science fiction writer.  And, uh, he decided to, um, make a religion.  And, uh, a lot of people find it, like this English guy reporter said,  some kind of fantasy thing.  But, uh, you know, what...  What is any religion, really?  Enough time goes by, and somehow they pick up more legitimacy than they had when,  you know, it was new. 
[01:26:30]  And who's to say which, uh, religion is...  What's right, wrong, who's the legitimate one?  I'll tell you the legitimate one.  Mine.  That's what everyone says.  Ah, that's right.  And that's the problem with the war.  That seems to be the problem, because people that disagree usually wind up killing each other  and blowing each other up in the name of God, which is wonderful.  No, when they disagree with my religion, their show gets...  They don't get picked up.  Is that it?  Their networks don't pick it up.  Look, you gotta say, it is weird, though, because usually you don't know who the guy who  started the religion is, like, actually made it a religion. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The guy was a fantasy writer.  I can see why people are looking at it like it's a little odd.  Because the whole theory behind it is like a science fiction story.  You know, but what is any...  You look at any religion, and they have these miraculous things that happen that, you know,  in this day and age, you couldn't possibly imagine seeing them happen, but...  Why?  Just because a couple of thousand years went by?  Does Scientology have spaceships?  I want my religion to have spaceships.  There were spaceships involved. 
[01:27:30]  There were some type of spaceships involved.  And big nuclear wars and things like that.  Aliens?  And genocide.  Aliens?  Aliens.  Looking like us or very different?  Volcanoes.  Cats?  No cats.  No cats.  I don't have a problem with that, because I truly believe cats are...  But that's the problem with all of us here on this planet.  We are full of these evil, like, or harmed spirits that you have to kind of get out of 
[01:28:00]  your body in order to reach this level of, you know, whatever-ness, goodness.  Has it expanded to London?  I mean, to England?  It's all over the world.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to the clip, because it's really good.  And we have to take a break.  I'm getting a break sign here.  So, back to the guy.  He says, I'm angry.  Yes.  Action like you're getting right now.  Well, buddy, you got it.  Right here.  Yeah.  I didn't hear...  I didn't hear the first time that he said, buddy.  Buddy.  You got it.  Right here.  Right now. 
[01:28:30]  Right here.  Right now.  Buddy.  Anyone?  I poised some.  Action like you're getting right now.  Well, buddy, you got it.  Right here.  Right now.  I'm angry.  Real angry.  Very good.  We're done, because if you use that term one more time to describe my religion...  We're not done.  I can't be responsible for my actions.  Now, my friends, it is your turn to listen to me.  All right.  Then the reporter goes, well, it's your turn to listen to me, and this is where it gets really good.  So, the reporter knew that he could pretty much slap this guy around after him saying, 
[01:29:00]  I'm angry.  Real angry.  Real angry.  Real angry.  I can't be held responsible for my actions.  It's like bad acting, too.  I'm angry.  Real angry.  Real angry.  Mr. Faber-Sham, I'm angry.  Real angry.  And this is what the reporter had to say.  What evidence, Sean Lonsdale, do you have that people have been tortured?  Oh, Tommy.  You didn't do that.  Hold a second, Tommy.  No, no, no.  Stop there, Tommy.  No, I'm not stopping here.  You listen to me for a second.  You're accusing members of my religion and engaging in brainwashed. 
[01:29:30]  No, Tommy, you stop.  No.  No, listen to me.  You were not there at the beginning of that interview.  You were not there.  You did not hear or record all the interviews.  Do you understand?  Brainwashing is a crime against humanity.  You are quoting the second half of the interview, not the first half.  You cannot assert what you're saying. 
[01:30:00]  Now, do you listen to me?  Remember those Monty Python, the twits?  They used to have the bandanas tied in knots over their head, and they'd hit themselves  over the head with bricks and stuff.  They would sound like that, just yelling, something out of Monty Python.  That's amazing, isn't it?  We're here at the upper class Twit of the Year contest.  I love audio like that.  A guy, yeah, a little over the top. 
[01:30:30]  But you could tell he was just being phony, because then he would be like, did you understand?  Being all smarmy.  Just don't be the two of them.  Oh, the two of them should learn how to talk to each other.  I don't mean to be so harsh, folks.  When we get back.  So don't forget, get your tickets for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour through Ticketmaster.com.  Indeed.  We'll talk about Cruella next.  Oh, yeah, I heard this story.  Front page of the paper today.  Cruella!  Kind of near my neighborhood a little bit. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's close.  That means you're an expert on this.  Following the Rich Voss rules, you're an expert on this.  I'm an expert.  I'm close enough.  It's Feds Bust evil slave mistress, Cruella, next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  I just got wowed.  I got wowed.  I'm in, I just got wowed.  Oh, thank God for Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker, get flashed, get happy.  Details are...  God forbid we mention a website. 
[01:31:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on 92.3 Pre-FM.  Good morning, everybody.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss never disappoints.  Gotta love Rich.  I feel bad when I yell at you because you give us great radio. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you.  And the weird thing is we're friends off air.  We play golf.  We're just a bunch of dopes on a golf course.  We're tight shorts.  A golf course.  Wearing tight shorts, yeah.  He hit the ball well.  I made him a lunch the last time we played.  Oh, my God.  My girlfriend.  I forgot to tell everybody.  Yeah, my girlfriend's like, what?  That is so adorable.  He made you lunch?  Well, I brought sandwich.  See, he's not brave enough to wear the short shorts anymore, so he figures, maybe if I pack  him a lunch.  Did you spread out a little table cloth? 
[01:32:30]  Dude.  In the sand trap.  And have a basket for a little picnic on the golf course?  We meet at a location, and then he's driving me to this, in like a strip mall, whatever.  Nothing important there.  And then I follow him to the golf course, and he's so excited.  He pulls up.  He's like, and I made us lunch.  And he's got like a little cooler with a little drink, a napkin, a little energy bar, and an 
[01:33:00]  egg salad sandwich.  That's your idea of a power lunch?  Egg salad?  I want to punch you in your face.  But you can't lift your arm either.  So then we get to the ninth hole, and that's when you usually eat, right?  If you know anything about golf, it's time for lunch.  Yeah.  That's when you go into the clubhouse, by the way, and buy lunch.  That seems to be the problem here.  The guy in the clubhouse who's giving me the coffee, the guy in the clubhouse, he orders  coffee, or he's standing right behind me, and the guy looks at me and goes, you 
[01:33:30]  are rich for us.  I go, yeah.  He goes, you're from the Opie and Anthony show.  He goes, I'm a huge Opie and Anthony fan.  I look at him, I'm like, not that huge, obviously.  Because I was the one that got Voss to coffee as he's going into the bathroom.  And then I'm like cursing the guy.  I'm like, now I got to give you a big tip.  You know who I am.  Like, here, here's five bucks for two.  That's hysterical.  Five bucks more than you.  For two coffees.  And then.  That is the worst one they recognize you.  You've got to throw a bigger tip.  I know.  I was like, oh, man. 
[01:34:00]  So.  So we recognize Voss.  Voss gets to take money away because they just know he's cheap.  They see Voss.  Hey, aren't you on people's lawns holding lanterns?  Little.  So then we get to the ninth hole.  It's time for the lunch that Rich Voss packed for us.  Ooh.  And I marched right into the old dining area and got myself a nice grilled chicken sandwich.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You weren't going to eat Rich's lunch?  I think he got a little sad.  No.  Because now there's a backup and we're waiting to tee off on the tenth hole.  And he's eating his egg salad sandwich, hoping that we can bond over egg salad. 
[01:34:30]  And I'm eating a nice grilled chicken.  Wait.  How does it work?  You get to the ninth hole.  You're supposed to keep going.  You guys, you can actually just go and buy stuff right there.  Well, in between, you know, there's a grill.  You don't sit down and have an hour.  Sometimes you do, but.  If you lose your spot, you know, you can lose your spot.  But there's also a halfway house, you know, at most courses.  Or they have.  Calls it a halfway house for you, maybe.  And then, you know, we're like, I don't know.  Now we're halfway done with the back nine and it's time for our energy bars. 
[01:35:00]  Would you like an energy bar?  Oh, so wait.  You just run up by a sandwich and get back on the course?  Yeah.  You don't go to a deli down the road right there.  They have it.  Yeah, you know.  You kind of eat because everyone does it.  So it leaves a little gap in the time.  So then you have just enough time to order something, grab it and go.  And then you're chowing down as you're getting ready to tee off.  But there's Richard packing a little lunch with little ice cubes to keep the egg salad sandwich like cool.  Because I'm like, dude, it was a really hot day. 
[01:35:30]  It's like 90.  I'm like, why would you bring egg salad to a golf course?  I go, no, I got a little cooler keeping it chilled.  First of all, dummy calls me.  He goes, well, I might not have a collar shirt.  Okay, multi-billionaire.  You don't have a collar.  So now I'm bringing shirts.  I'm bringing them clothing, food.  I feel like I adopted them.  No, it's like I'm wearing a collar shirt today.  But it's like as far as golf shirts go, I don't.  I hate them.  Do you have to on the golf course? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, it's a dumb rule.  It's a collar shirt.  Or now they have where you can wear like the semi-mock turtleneck because Tiger wears them.  You know, it was a big thing.  Yeah.  Anyway.  He doesn't wear collar shirts.  Oh, so but you sidetracked us here.  The real reason we're bringing up Rich Voss again, we're in commercials, and he points  at the TV beyond excited, and he goes, Bonnie had sex with that guy in L.A.  Today, he pointed?  Yes. 
[01:36:30]  While you were out of the studio, all excited.  Like, he's so excited that his wife had sex with someone famous or something.  Who was it, Jerry Falwell?  He's been on TV.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  Is the person a celebrity?  Tell you the truth, Parmy went, uh-oh, he knows.  On TV.  That's what I'm getting at, idiot. 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  But anyway, so why were you excited that your wife slept with someone when she was in L.A.?  Well, but when you see it, you know, the guy pops up, and you're going, whoa, he's in  a movie or whatever, or he's doing something, and you go, oh, you know, it's like, it was  before I met her.  It was before I met her.  She pointed out so excited.  Well, you know, what the heck?  My wife slept with him, and I'm trying to figure out which guy on the screen it was.  Well, it was, it was, he's the star. 
[01:37:30]  The Oakland Raiders.  But why, why were you excited?  Because you're, you're almost famous, because she, like, banged a famous dude?  First of all, explain something.  Wait, wait.  I want to know now.  I was not in the room.  It's some guy that's in a movie.  All right, but I know his name.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  He's probably been in other movies.  No, you would not know his name.  I didn't even recognize him.  The guy could walk past you on the street, no one would ever go, hey, wow! 
[01:38:00]  Didn't even recognize him.  No clue.  All right, so it's not, uh...  We're not, we're not playing charades or anything.  I don't know the guy's name.  Charades.  Looking at 40 questions with Northern Blaine charades.  Just try to mime having sex with Bonnie.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, you are funny.  Yeah, I don't know.  It just, it popped up.  I saw, whoa, you know.  I mean, because no one's going to even go to the movie, but, you know.  Hey, it was kind of cool to see it.  Not really.  That would be cool for me.  What's that? 
[01:38:30]  I would never be happy if I saw it.  No, I'd be...  Like you.  I wouldn't want to know that.  I wouldn't want to point that out.  Hey.  Well, I'm not calling the guy.  You jumped up off your seat like all excited.  Bonnie had sex with that guy.  She bought an egg salad sandwich.  Is that how famous you want to be?  No, I...  It's like he's in a movie, so you have some connection to him.  Good thing you're not dating Monica Lewinsky.  All right, getting into some more news.  On the front page of the Post today, Cruella, feds-bust evil slave mistress. 
[01:39:00]  She looks beyond evil.  Oh, what a...  I wonder...  I wonder if this is one of those things they'll find out is happening a lot.  You know?  It's kind of a weird area, that mutton town area, North Shore, Nassau County, and a lot  of wealthy people live up there.  You've got to think these whorehouses...  Well, I mean, you've seen in the news enough lately that these whorehouses, they're trying  to hide by going into the really nice neighborhoods, the whorehouses, and then, and... 
[01:39:30]  But they were using them as slaves.  This isn't a whorehouse.  This isn't a whorehouse.  No, I know, but I mean, all this type of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm thinking, like, I wonder if that's kind of the thing to do.  You know, in rich neighborhoods, they kind of, like, have these things to do, and they're  like, oh, have you checked out this service, or this thing, or, you know, these maids,  or this...  Like, they're all nosy, busybodies, and try to, like, you know, outdo each other.  And I'm just wondering if maybe having Indonesian slaves is, like, kind of something to do in 
[01:40:00]  the, in the, with these communities.  With, like, maids and stuff like that?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, because apparently these two...  Whether they're beating them or taking care of them, I mean, even.  You know, maybe, maybe they, they get them from somewhere, I don't know where, and maybe  treat them nice, some, some families, and some treat them like crap, like these.  Well, you pay them.  I mean, they, I'm making $200 a month to pay somebody for, for this.  They was, like, sending money back to Indonesia to their family. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  And apparently they're supposed to pay $200 a month to the family, and now they're only  paying $100 a month, and they were beating them, and just, they took their passports  when they came off, which to me is just...  Wow.  That was how they got them to stay.  They took their passports when they arrived to the country.  Well, that's what you're saying, Anthony.  Like, they would sit down at a dinner party and go, well, my Indonesian, you know.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Like, the other one, you know.  And they bring them over.  Usually it's, they got to send money back to the slave trader also.  Like, if they bring them over illegally, but they had passports?  They were not brought over illegally. 
[01:41:00]  These were not slaves in the sense that they were brought over, like, you know, in a ship  or, like, were captured.  They think they came here to work, but they were treated like slaves because they were just  brutalized and, like, the money was not sent back that was supposed to be instead of  200 or 100.  Okay, so they came here to be, or they went to be domestic help.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then wound up being abused by this family.  I think so.  Why don't we find out?  Oh, that's a good idea.  Long Island hiding a disturbing secret.  Police say they rescued two women who were enslaved in the suburbs. 
[01:41:30]  They were allegedly held against their will inside a multi-million dollar home in the  exclusive neighborhood of Muttentown in Nassau County.  Fox 5's Reed Lamberty is following the investigation.  Behind the manicured landscape, expensive cars, and million-plus dollar home, an alleged  prison where prosecutors say two Indonesian women lived as slaves, cooking and cleaning  for this wealthy Long Island couple.  I'm just really shocked to find out.  I had to come see the house because I couldn't believe it happened here. 
[01:42:00]  Prosecutors say the women were tortured, often beaten with a stick, forced to eat red-hot  chili peppers, and kept in a three-foot-by-three-foot...  Man, she's a weirdo.  Eat red-hot chili peppers.  It's like, and boy, if these two go to jail, and then that's not going to go well.  No.  Two rich people just abusing a poor...  That's not going to go well.  That's even worse than just basic abuse.  That's like above and beyond, like making them eat chili peppers and stuff like that.  That's above and beyond.  Yeah.  That's like people that enjoy cruelty. 
[01:42:30]  It's not just neglect or anything.  Like, oh, they're neglecting these people.  That's like real sick, sadistic people.  But why didn't these people during the day just take off?  And apparently one finally did.  One finally did, but they had no passports.  Where are they going to go?  They said that if you leave, we're going to have your...  We use our money to have your family in Indonesia jailed.  And I mean, look, they come across here just to work in someone's house.  It's like, I don't know.  A little brainwashing going on there, Rich.  Chili peppers and kept in a three-foot-by-three-foot room. 
[01:43:00]  One of the women escaped Sunday...  Who the hell has a three-foot-by-three-foot room?  What is that?  A three-foot-by-three-foot room?  A pantry, maybe?  Yeah.  Among the canned goods?  One of the women escaped Sunday morning and was seen wandering outside a nearby Dunkin' Donuts.  Manager Adrienne Mohamed was floored by what she had to say.  I asked her if who she's staying or where she's living, and she said the word, master. 
[01:43:30]  Now, I thought she had said mister, but my night guy says, no, it sounded like she said master.  So I said, okay, do you still stay with this master?  She said no.  And she motioned her hand in this way as if she was telling me she was being beaten.  Oh.  Yeah, I guess she had a hard time getting a point across.  Yeah.  There's two people in the...  There's two pictures of one of the girls.  The one girl this guy is talking about, and then so the cops or whatever went back to the house, and they found another girl.  They found her huddled in a closet, so this woman wasn't making it up. 
[01:44:00]  But there's two pictures of this woman in the blue.  One is her squatting in the closet, and the other is her laying on a mat by the door, which she said is how they made her sleep.  But my problem with this second picture is that the Daily News photographer or whatever page...  Oh, it's the post.  Post photographer probably said to her, just lay on the mat like you're going to sleep.  But he actually had her act as out.  Oh, no, like post...  Showing everybody how she was...  Which I guess I can understand why, but that is kind of...  Nah, it's...  You don't ask other crime victims to do that.  Yeah, it's not... 
[01:44:30]  I don't know.  If you're a photographer, you're just supposed to take pictures.  You don't set up a scene.  Probably show the mat and then little cash, and this is where she would sleep without a blanket or pillow.  But in one photo, they found her and she has her shoes on, and in the next photo, her shoes are by the mat.  So she said by the toilet, just show us how you sleep, and she did, and they snapped a picture.  You know what?  I'm an idiot.  I thought, because I just kind of passed that by really quickly in the paper this morning,  I thought those pictures were taken sometime earlier, and they actually put like sacks over their heads to make them go to sleep. 
[01:45:00]  I did too at first.  But they blocked out their faces in the photo.  All right, we got more to the...  There was a bag over their head.  More to the story here.  The couple, Varsha Mahender Sabnani and Mahender Muladar Sabnani,  are multi-millionaires who run a perfume business out of their mutton-town home.  They're accused of luring the women to work for them and keeping them in deplorable conditions.  They pled not guilty at today's hearing.  The prosecutor was alleging that this was a case of essentially imprisonment, 
[01:45:30]  and when the family leaves and goes on vacation for 10 weeks at a time,  and you have adult housekeepers in the home, they certainly have access to leave.  Oof.  Now, I'm really confused, though.  So why did they do this?  Why did who do it?  Why did Cruella do this?  They're calling her Cruella.  Maybe she's just a vicious woman.  I mean, I don't know.  Nothing hasn't come out yet.  Some people are just cruel.  Like, what does she get out of it?  She's just that sick?  It might just be it's being alleged that, yeah, she just maybe is a cruel person. 
[01:46:00]  Was she getting sexual favor?  I mean, what does she get out of it?  Maybe she's just a disciplinarian in her mind,  and she's raised a certain way, like, okay, and this is how you get things done.  You penalize it.  Who knows?  How you get the job done, yeah.  One of those kind of strict people.  I want to know how you become a multimillionaire selling perfume out of your house.  It's really creepy, isn't it?  What's that? 
[01:46:30]  It probably just reeks in there.  What kinds of 80 different perfumes in the air?  You're an awful husband.  Yeah, just spraying perfume in their little closet.  Ten weeks at a time, though, is a long time to be gone.  It does kind of raise, like, well, why didn't they just leave?  You can never say, like, why didn't they just leave?  There's always, like, somebody will turn around and say, well, you know,  they were scared or they didn't have this, that, or the other thing.  You can't convince people.  We talked yesterday about a woman named Colleen Stan, who I read a book on, 
[01:47:00]  who was kidnapped by a couple.  They were, like, sexual sadists in California.  They kept her for seven years.  Seven years?  Seven years she was kidnapped.  The book is called The Perfect Victim, and she was in a coffin-like box,  which, you know, for claustrophobics.  Like, they would keep her head in a little box and keep her in a coffin under the bed  in a compartment they built under the bed with air holes in the bottom.  It's like the gimp.  Exactly.  It's exactly what it's like.  And eventually they let her out after years to go home and see her family,  and then they let her work, and they convinced her she was part of a white slavery ring.  So at this point she wouldn't tell. 
[01:47:30]  They had her sign a contract, and she was so brainwashed that she,  even if she was an American, she spoke the language, and she still believed it.  So if you're, like, thinking that these women are people, you know what I mean?  They're from another country.  She would visit her family and then come back to go in the box?  Yes, after years and years.  I don't even know if they made her sleep in the box after X amount of years.  Thank you.  Why did you feel like you had to tell everyone what that was?  Well, I just, you know, because a lot of people think, well, just, you know, it goes deep.  In a tight place.  Well, I could be wrong, but I always thought it just meant a fear of being in a closed-in space. 
[01:48:00]  Being buried alive is one of those, which would be claustrophobic.  You know, you could be claustrophobic being in that situation,  but people get claustrophobic being in a closet or in a tight space.  You know what?  You know what?  You could be right.  I could be wrong on this one.  Well, we're finding out right now.  I thought.  Than is pointing at me just going, yes, you're right.  He's an idiot.  I thought it was the fear of a guy coming right at you wearing short shorts.  I can't get that out of my head. 
[01:48:30]  That's vostrophobic.  I'm vostrophobic.  It's being too close to an idiot.  Did you have your hand on your hip when you were wearing your short shorts?  I really need to know more.  Hey, we got a quickie before we go to break.  Yeah.  I got E-Rock looking it up on dictionary.com, wherever he's going.  Oh, no.  Poor Al Bundy.  He's in a little bit of trouble.  Well, yes.  Oh, no, or it's Bud Bundy.  I'm sorry.  You scared me. 
[01:49:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Bud Bundy.  The son.  C-H-L-O-R.  Okay.  He doesn't know how to spell claustrophobic.  All right.  We'll get there in a second.  This is quick.  This is, what's his real name?  David Fosfino?  Yeah.  You're not spelling it right.  Over and over again.  You're as dumb as they can.  All right.  Start spelling it.  He puts C-H-L.  It's not chloroform.  He's as dumb as a person I've probably ever met.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Claustrophobia.  Pertaining to or suffering from claustrophobia. 
[01:49:30]  There you go.  Tending to or claustrophobia.  I know you love those definitions.  I know you love those definitions.  It's like yield means to yield.  Right.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Settled.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Yield.  The act of yielding.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  Wow.  All right.  Yield.  Yield der.  C-H-L.  He looked up for claustrophobia.  An abnormal fear of being in enclosed or narrow places.  What is it?  I think around Paul was an abnormal fear of being in narrow or enclosed space. 
[01:50:00]  He's probably got to confuse with spelling cholesterol.  Voss said that that was a good idea.  You made it seem like that was a misconception.  You know, people think it's just small spaces, but it's actually buried alive, and the dictionary  is going, no, it is.  It's small spaces.  Coffin being one of them.  That's the old dictionary.  The new one.  The old dictionary.  What?  If people were buried alive in superdome-sized coffins, no one would be afraid of it. 
[01:50:30]  But they're not.  It's a little thing.  It's the little space.  It has to be a little space.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Rich Voss, are you going to be at Catch a Rising Star in Providence all weekend long?  Yeah.  Thursday shows or what?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Very nice.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05. 
[01:51:00]  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony show on 92.3 Pre-FM.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a virus. 
[01:51:30]  It's called the ONA virus.  Before the break, we told you Bud Bundy's in trouble.  That's how I know him.  Kind of like the old days when we were hanging out with Greg Brady and he wanted us to call  him Barry Williams.  I'm like, you're Greg Brady.  It's Greg Brady.  It'll always be Greg Brady.  I'm Barry Williams.  Are you?  He wanted us to call him Barry.  I had such a tough time doing that.  Bud Bundy.  David Faustino.  Yeah, it's a quickie.  Oh, a former TV icon was arrested in Central Florida over the weekend. 
[01:52:00]  That icon.  I guess he's an icon.  David Faustino.  Yeah, exactly.  Bud Bundy from TV's Married with Children is now facing misdemeanor charges of marijuana  possession and his orderly intoxication.  He was arrested on Flagler Avenue in Volusia County Saturday morning.  At first, an officer thought Faustino tried to hit his estranged wife.  She says he didn't.  But the officer says Faustino was very drunk and had marijuana in his pocket.  He has since been released from jail. 
[01:52:30]  Another child star.  What does this mean?  Another child star in trouble.  In trouble.  Icon.  That was the hardest part of that story to swallow.  He didn't do anything after Married with Children, right?  No.  What was his next project?  Do we even know?  Nothing.  Nothing.  That show was huge.  Huge, huge in the 80s.  And you watch it now and, oh, it's just horrible.  Yeah, but it was a horrible show.  There were some funny, miserable lines, though, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Like Al had some good lines.  But a lot of shows don't hold up to the test of time.  No.  Back then, it was a one of a kind.  There was no shows like that on TV.  Yeah.  It was always nice sitcom families getting along for the most part.  I'll tell you what didn't hold up.  MASH, unfortunately.  I mean, the serious moments on MASH hold up, but the humor is very punny and very jokey.  Like, it just, eh.  Like, although I still think the acting is amazing and, like, the other moments that they pulled off in a sitcom are even more amazing now because of how soft television it is. 
[01:53:30]  But, like, the jokes just don't, like, you know, I don't even want to see your Looney Tunes.  Like, you let that, ugh.  But what did you say?  Uh, hold up, nothing's being replayed right now on network television to hold up.  Is that what, what are you saying?  Me, hold up.  Me, oh, no, no.  The jokes aren't, like, when you look at them, you don't laugh at them anymore.  Like, Taxi you'll watch, All in the Family you'll watch, Honeymooners you're watching, and you'll still laugh at it.  You'll still laugh because the humor holds up.  The Honeymooners, beyond amazing still. 
[01:54:00]  The most classic humor.  Yeah.  Sanford and Son, you still laugh at.  I mean, just miserable.  Mary Tyler Moore.  Yeah.  I don't know if, I haven't seen an episode of that in years, so who knows if that would hold up.  Well, Bob Newhart's got to hold up.  That's like Ted Knight, though.  I'll tell you what doesn't hold up on Mary Tyler Moore is stupid Rhoda.  It's so sitcom-y.  I never liked her on the show.  I'm like, it's so sitcom-y.  Her, like, you know, I don't know, man.  We are right.  And it's, it's, it's, it's to a 70s hippie kind of.  Power of love.  Summer of love.  They got that whole look.  Like, her whole look is, you can't watch it and not think. 
[01:54:30]  It's like Charlie's Angels is the same thing.  Something like that.  You just can't look at the hair and not go, ah, completely dated.  Yeah.  I was watching last night that got me laughing was, uh, Back to the Future was on.  So, uh, I pop it on to go to sleep to.  And, um, I realized that at the beginning when Doc sets the time machine for the future,  he's going 25 years in the future.  That's like three years from now.  Uh-oh.  Pretty much it.  Still no flying stuff. 
[01:55:00]  No, and then, and then he, when I say stuff, we used to say flying cars.  I just want the flying skateboard.  That's all.  At the end, he goes 30 years into the future, which in 1985, uh, would make it, um, what,  help me please with the math.  2015.  2015.  Is that right?  85, 2015.  I didn't want to do the math.  What, for, uh, 30 years?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was, yeah.  So we only have, like, maybe, uh, seven or eight years, um, left until it reaches that  point.  And when he came back, the car was flying. 
[01:55:30]  It had that little food processor thing on the back where you could put food in and it  turns into nuclear energy.  And it came out with those wacky glasses on.  It's like, wait a minute.  This is going to happen in eight years.  And, and then my girlfriend said, no, you idiot.  It's a movie.  It kind of made me feel stupid.  Uh, hey, uh, we got to worry about popcorn lung.  Popcorn lung?  Popcorn lung.  What the hell is that? 
[01:56:00]  Let's ask, uh, the expert.  Rich Voss, what do you think popcorn lung is?  It's, uh, if you eat too much popcorn, sometimes the kernels, I have no idea.  Oh, wow.  You're on to me for a minute.  The kernels will get lodged between your lungs and your, uh, esophagus or what, your food.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Your, your kernels.  Your kernels.  Popcorn lung.  Kernels.  What do you got?  I, I would say, uh, it's dangerous.  I know what it is.  I would say.  Oh, Jimmy knows.  If you eat a bunch of uncooked popcorn and then you lay on your back and it's, it's sunny 
[01:56:30]  out.  It will cook in your lungs and you'll die.  That's a stupid way to go.  I don't think that's it.  Popcorn lung.  You're telling me it's Agent Orange.  It, I would say it has nothing to do with literal popcorn.  Oh, really?  I thought it was just some kind of thing that maybe, um, the air sacs in your lungs kind  of harden and, and because the doctors say it looks like popcorn, um, that it's called  popcorn lung.  Well, like cauliflower ear isn't actually cauliflower on your ear, although it could be, but that's 
[01:57:00]  just stupid.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Now we have to worry about popcorn lung.  Now to a health alert about one of America's favorite snack foods.  No, it is popcorn.  Microwave popcorn.  What happens when you open that bag up?  Yeah, you get that whiff of something really good, but there may be something else going  on as well.  And Chris has the story.  Rob, to be sure, it is one of the distinct pleasures in the home.  Popcorn, especially of the microwave to mouth variety, but the butter flavor is raising  questions. 
[01:57:30]  Could this delight be dangerous to something other than your waistline?  Ah, nothing smells like buttered popcorn, a snack made easy to enjoy thanks to the microwave.  It's tough to believe that aroma could be anything but pleasurable, but the same chemical used  to create that buttery smell has been linked to serious health issues for workers who make  the snacks.  Oh, my God.  I know what it is.  They put cigarettes in the popcorn.  When they say microwave to mouth, isn't that where you don't rub it on your elbow first? 
[01:58:00]  Microwave to mouth.  You don't hide it around the house and play squirrel with popcorn.  You take it out and you put it in your mouth.  And play squirrel?  What is that?  You know, hide it around like a squirrel deal with his nuts.  You know, you hide it around the house.  What are you dissecting every little one?  No, I'm actually asking.  There was a game that older gentlemen played.  I used to play squirrel around the house.  Yeah.  It was like hide Easter eggs.  I thought it was like a game that people...  I've heard of squirrel it away or something. 
[01:58:30]  You know what I'm...  But what the joke was, microwave to mouth and I got a laugh with the elbow thing.  And I should have stopped.  All right.  We'll go back to the audio.  Been linked to serious health issues for workers who make the snacks, like 53-year-old Jerry Blalock.  I've got grandkids who take me to the zoo and I get a fair meeting at parks.  Ooh.  And I no longer can do it.  After working just 10 months at the St. Louis Flavoring Company, he developed a life-threatening disease commonly called popcorn lung.  Commonly called? 
[01:59:00]  You cannot say commonly called when no one knows what the hell you're talking about.  Yeah, we've been on this earth a while now and I've never heard that term before.  Do they bring canaries into the popcorn factory just in case?  Right.  Take a look at them.  He's still alive.  So it's the chemical that produces the buttery smell and it's giving factory workers lung problems.  Oh, wow.  Love the criticism over there for each other.  You know, there's going to be a big cover-up.  I just wrote it.  There's going to be a big cover-up and there's going to be an investigation.  Who's covering up the popcorn smell that was giving the lung problem? 
[01:59:30]  Okay.  Talk to me.  I'm staring at you.  But it's factory workers.  Yeah.  It's not people at home eating popcorn.  Yeah.  No, it's like the rat mentality.  You know, you've got to be exposed to this just a ridiculous amount.  The saccharine rats.  Right.  Yeah.  10 months.  Now his once healthy lungs can hold just 45% of breathing capacity.  45% less.  When heated in a factory setting, the chemical produces a toxic and potentially lethal gas. 
[02:00:00]  David Michaels, a former assistant secretary of energy, has been studying the issue for the last four years.  Four years?  Workers who mix the chemical either as a liquid or as a powder breathe in small amounts of this chemical and it just devastates their lungs.  So now the comfort food is coming under scrutiny from those who want to be sure that ripping open a bag at home isn't a hazard.  How much popcorn do you have to eat at home for a different time? 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God.  You've got to have it cooking constantly.  Stop popcorn.  Just vats and vats of popcorn all over the house.  You're not opening a hazard.  Right.  It's at the factory.  More people choke to death on it than we'll ever die.  Absolutely.  You open it up and Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo walk in with hazmat suits.  That was pretty good.  I want to bite your cheek.  No, it wasn't.  I want to bite your cheek.  Just because of the way you tried to make it clever by mentioning the names of the actors and not the movie. 
[02:01:00]  He wanted to say, it's like something like an outbreak, but no, no, no.  He had to think.  Was that Rene Russo or was that Melanie Griffith?  Let me think.  You walk in like Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo and then he just lost it in hazmat suits.  Ah, it's bad suits.  Well, we've got a congresswoman involved here.  Oh, good.  That's what we need.  There we go.  The FDA has never studied the effects of diacetyl, but Conagra Foods, the makers of Orville Redenbacher, told us they're confident the everyday use of their popcorn is safe for consumers. 
[02:01:30]  And when it comes to diacetyl, the focus of concern is workplace exposure.  Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro is asking the FDA to ban the chemical altogether until it can be proven safe to consumers.  We need to revoke its designation, test it further, and protect the public health.  For now, the situation is literally up in the air.  No proof that home exposure is toxic, but as Michael says, better to be safe than sorry.  I know in my home, when we make microwave popcorn. 
[02:02:00]  Imagine he was like a closet smoker and his wife was on him for decades.  It's the popcorn.  He finally got lung problems and went, it's the popcorn.  Damn popcorn.  What is this guy going to say?  Because I heard he was getting into something that sounded like it was going to sound ridiculous.  Safe and sorry.  I know in my home, when we make microwave popcorn, we open it up underneath the vent over the stove so no one breathes the fumes.  I'd like to see some branch of the federal government actually go out and test what's coming off these bags and is it causing any illness. 
[02:02:30]  It should be noted, flavoring manufacturers have already paid out more than $100 million as a result of suits brought by workers affected by popcorn lung.  In California, a bill is being considered to ban its use in the state altogether, but the consumer side, not as much is known about it.  More testing.  More testing.  $100 million for popcorn lung?  $100 million given out for popcorn lung. 
[02:03:00]  What do they use?  This fine gasoline-asbestos combination smells like popcorn when you heat it.  It's so tasty.  What is it?  Why don't they just use butter?  Butter and cyanide.  And popcorn.  Butter and dried corn makes popcorn.  Package it.  These are reports coming in.  E-Rock, the only documented case of home popcorn lung.  And E-Rock has popcorn body.  E-Rock, you going to take that?  It doesn't matter. 
[02:03:30]  What?  What?  No.  You can...  I did reach for the bottle.  I'm so gullible.  I'm shocked.  Hey, we got audio.  What?  What?  Michael Bolton.  Oh.  This is timely.  This goes back to 2003.  At Fenway Park.  Let me just throw this at E-Rock.  There we go.  All right.  Michael Bolton.  Doing a terrific job with the National Anthem at Fenway Park. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, can you see  Madam Dawn's early light  What so proudly we hailed  At the twilight's last gleaming  Whose broad stripes and bright stars  Through the perilous fight 
[02:04:30]  For the ramparts we watched  Uh-oh.  How uncomfortable.  I didn't think we were going to get the payoff, man. 
[02:05:00]  Good recovery, though.  Good recovery.  They all clapped like,  All right, idiot.  They were ready to give him a beating.  Ready to kill.  And he decided to just sing really loud  And emotional.  Oh.  He got it.  Boy, that's got to be the worst.  What was he, a newsroom reporter?  Remember when the guy...  Come on.  Wait, well, that's a good callback  To the first story earlier.  You know what?  I'd like to open this wall  And just wheel you out.  Or just throw popcorn at me. 
[02:05:30]  Listeners are a bit confused.  Uh, you're listening to  Bring Your Kid to Work Day.  Uh, we, none of us have kids yet,  So we decide Rich Voss would be perfect.  Are you kidding me?  Without a word, I wanted to just,  I wanted to open the wall  Like it was a door  And we're like 15 or 16 floors up  And then just like,  Not even say anything to you,  Just gently turn you around  And push.  Push you out.  And watch you go out  And over the edge.  I, uh, I was going to hit the car crash  And then I realized  The car crash would have saved him. 
[02:06:00]  He just kept going  And, and digging yourself deeper  In that hole.  You don't get, you don't,  Listen, here's the thing.  Oh, I got it all right.  All right, wait, Rich might be honest.  I'm going to throw that back there, E-Rock.  Uh, Michael Bolton was reading  The words off his hand when he paused.  Couldn't he have a teleprompter?  Yeah.  He didn't really know the words.  That's what the video shows?  Yeah, he stopped, you know,  Where you can hear him stopping  And he kind of looks,  His eyes dart around  And then he looks down  Like, right at his hand  Trying to be subtle 
[02:06:30]  But he's on television.  How big is his hand  And he could write the whole  Star Spangled Banner on it?  He would get the first couple of words  Oh, now I got to use my other hand.  It'd be at my elbow  And around my torso.  Michael Bolton.  I celebrate his entire catalog.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  You were talking about  You were talking about the newsreader.  I, I, I...  That's a great movie.  I really got to watch it.  Yeah.  See the whole thing.  You need a teleprompter  Or something like...  Or on the ground.  Don't put it on your hand.  We have to hold it up 
[02:07:00]  And look at it.  You were talking about  The newsreader that lost his place, right?  Yeah.  And, and see how he paused?  And it was like  He lost his place.  Right.  Oh, there it is.  There's the picture.  Dad, if you guys got it.  Oh, God.  That's a little obvious.  He just brings his hand up  To his face.  Let me read.  What is he?  Rick Shapiro?  You would think that you would just  If you're going to do that  You would, I don't know  Practice over and over again  Make sure  It's not the easiest song to sing  You know the lines  Maybe they asked him the night before 
[02:07:30]  And he just didn't know  I know there is nothing worse  Than forgetting the words to a song  When you're singing  Very, very, very embarrassing  You got to just kind of  Mumble your way through it  And hope no one notices  But everyone notices  And the biggest problem is  When you're singing a song  For the most part  You don't know  What you're singing  Until that line actually comes up  So you're thinking of it  In your head  As the song goes along  And you can't  You don't know  What the hell the next line is 
[02:08:00]  Until that moment  You have to sing it  I've had that with jokes  Where you know  If right now  Someone put a gun in your head  And said  Recite  What's the punchline  And you'd be like  Right, right  I have no idea  Just a panic  Yeah  It's a rhythm  But then as you're going  You realize  Hey  But then there are those times  Where it's just like  Uh oh  Dead spot  Dude  I was practicing  And I'll blow the joke  I don't care  I was going over  It was like  I'm shooting HBO special  And I was practicing  The closing joke 
[02:08:30]  For my HBO special  And I'm like  I'm forgetting the punchline  And I had to go through it  And it was finally  Orange you're glad  I didn't say banana  Shut up  You tool  Thank God  God you got me  I hate you  I want you sitting  On Rich's lap  As I wheel you both  Out the window  I'll just push him  And then I might as well  Jump and just follow him down  By the way  There's a show going on  Outside the studio  I guess they're all laughing  At Roland today  Because he's been doing  Impressions for everybody  Roland's doing impressions 
[02:09:00]  He does  I heard  Club Soda Kenny  Yep  Oh which other one  Did I hear  It was great  What was the other one  Seinfeld  You do  You do a Seinfeld  Dude  Close your eyes  Alright here's Roland  He books the guests  For our show  Hi Roland  Hello  Good job on Ozzy  The other day  Thanks  Who are these people  That's not enough  Everyone can do that part  George  Where's Kramer 
[02:09:30]  How much popcorn did he eat  That's actually  That's actually  Ted Seinfeld  Why do you think  You can do impressions  I don't  My voice sounds the same  For everybody  But what  They were just  Egg and yawn  I don't know  It just comes out sometimes  I don't know  He does these impersonations  I swear  You would think  It was the real people  It just comes out  This gift just comes out 
[02:10:00]  Yeah this gift  Like he's an idiot savant  Without that pesky savant  Heart yeah  What uh  I gotta see a little more Seinfeld  Let me  Let me  Okay  Here's the scene  You're in the  Chinese restaurant  Right  And you  Trying to get  A table  And you're frustrated  Because  There's no tables available  You've been there the whole time  And go  George we should leave 
[02:10:30]  This restaurant  It sounds like Dracula  Fanset  I love right after the line  It's  Look at this radio  His entire face  Collapses  All in on itself  What about the pen  The episode with the pen  This pen  Right  It's backwards  Backwards  After that pen  Upside down  Upside down  Before you do an impression  You should turn around first  And fix your hair  Turn around 
[02:11:00]  And then turn around back  You should fix your hair  With a 38  By the way  He also does  Club Soda Ken  Yes he does  A dead on  Club Soda Ken  Thank you G.H. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you  Good night  Good night  Good night  I don't  We see him in the morning  That's Kenny on the Walton  Yeah  None of us see him at night  It's not an accurate impression  This is zero confidence  It's just the least confidence  A human can have  Without just his life force  Leaving his body  And him falling down dead  His nose is sweating  He is soaked  Is there anyone else  Because I know  You know a lot of celebrities 
[02:12:00]  Through booking and everything  Is there anybody else  That you do impressions of?  Never really  No?  No  Do more Kenny  I mean come on  Yeah let's hear Kenny  Want to hear me do  The Monster Mash  Do you do  An impression  Of our own  Master Po  Gentleman  Is this free food again?  And then he goes  A Yiddish 
[02:12:30]  Master Po  Yeah  I'm gonna  Beat you up  Can you do  Christopher Walken  That seems to be a popular one  That Jay Moore does  Very well  That's bizarre  So the answer to your question  Would be no  Yeah  He can't  Who's coming up on our show  In the near future?  Chuck Liddell  If we're gonna call in  Oh good  That's good  This might be a little hack 
[02:13:00]  Everyone does it  So you should have no problem  Doing this  Arnold  Arnold Schwarzenegger  A lot of people do  I'm gonna go when they tour  Archie Bunker  That would be an easy one for him  How about  How about this?  How about  Not walking  Jack Nicholson  Oh  You can't handle the truth  It was a question
