<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a caller, Joey, venting his frustrations about marriage, his wife, and his family.  The hosts then promoted Crystal Storm's appearance at Flash Dancers and a WOW sticker event at On the Border in New Brunswick, New Jersey for Cinco de Mayo.  Mark Burnett, creator of *Survivor*, was interviewed. He discussed the show's premise, the challenges (including eating rats), and revealed that both crew and contestants engaged in sexual activity during filming. He clarified a rumor about a contestant's suicide, stating it happened in an international version, not the American one, and mentioned a contestant's post-show disciplinary actions against his son.

Following the Burnett interview, Louis Black joined the show.  They discussed the increasingly bizarre nature of reality TV, brainstorming even more extreme ideas, including a show with murderers competing for freedom.  Crystal Storm, a dancer with exceptionally large breasts, was brought into the studio, resulting in discussions focused on her physical attributes.  Scott, a midget, was also introduced, leading to jokes about the size difference between him and Crystal Storm.  The conversation continued to bounce between reality TV and humorous interactions with Crystal Storm and Scott, focusing heavily on their physical characteristics.  Advertisements for Fidelity Diamond and Paisano's restaurant aired throughout this segment.

The show continued with announcements about "Parrish family" events and a bizarre photo shoot involving Crystal Storm and Scott.  Further discussion involved Scott's profession as an associate director of recreation at a nursing home and his experiences as a little person, including his dating life and perspectives on being a little person.  Listener calls were interspersed with conversations with Scott and Lewis Black, who shared his opinions on Giuliani's prostate cancer and the Clintons.  Tangents included reminiscences about *The Little Rascals*, discussions about the physical attributes of little people, and jokes deemed offensive by modern standards.  Advertisements for laser eye surgery (Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff), Vermont Teddy Bears, and *Time Out New York* magazine were played, along with a comedic bit, "Real World Midget Town."  "Spaz's Week in Review" followed, a rambling, often nonsensical news segment filled with offensive language and racially insensitive remarks targeting African Americans, white people in Zimbabwe, and Vietnamese people.  Spazâ€™s commentary included insensitive remarks about a subway push victim and a related fundraising effort.  He referenced a past mugging incident to explain some of his views.  The segment featured heated exchanges and interruptions from Opie and Anthony, culminating in a physical altercation between Spaz and another person in the studio. The broadcast concluded with a brief mention of a Cinco de Mayo event and a goodbye message.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into the conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony, more stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  It's FU Friday.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Let's go to Joey real fast.  Joey, what's up?  Hey, guys, big FU to the institution of marriage.  Why?  Whoever thought of that, what a blindside sucker punch that was. 
[00:00:30]  I mean, if this guy wasn't dead, I'd like to kick him out in the nuts myself.  FU to my wife for saying I do.  My father-in-law for giving her away.  Yeah.  Well, I'd like to FU to my mother for not warning me what I was getting into.  What happened?  Where'd it go bad?  It's just the whole nine yards.  How long have you been married?  A week?  Too long.  Eight years.  Eight years.  Three kids.  But, you know, the thing is, though, you can't get divorced because then you've got to work four jobs. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  We've heard those horror stories.  So thank God for places like Privilege.  Thank God for you guys for making me pissing my pants on the ride home for work.  All right.  And FU to Pakistan, Sloatsburg, and everything else, guys.  God love you.  Hey, thank you.  All right, boys.  Rock on.  Hang in there, right?  All right, buddy.  All right.  He's having a bad time with it.  Yeah.  We have Crystal Storm.  She's going to be in studio in a few minutes here. 
[00:01:30]  She's going to be at Flash Dancers across from the Letterman studio.  It's a second in Broadway tonight from 6 to 9 p.m.  No, three shows.  I'm sorry.  Tonight at 6, 9, and midnight.  And tomorrow, 6, 9, midnight, and 2 a.m. shows.  See her in her huge cans.  Huge cans.  We've got a midget coming in, too.  We can get some good photo ops between Crystal Storm and the midget.  Anthony, we're doing another WOW sticker stop today.  Where is this one?  Well, it's Cinco de Mayo, you know. 
[00:02:00]  Cinco de Mayo.  Si.  Why does that always fall on May 5th?  Well, we're going to be at a place called On the Border.  It's on Route 1 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Butchie and Rudy and Matt Devote and the gang are going to be there from 530 to,  8 o'clock tonight.  Yeah.  And they're going to have tons, and I mean tons, of WOW stickers to give away, okay?  Nice.  And it's the largest Cinco de Mayo party in the state of New Jersey.  So if you're in the area, you want to get a WOW sticker, 
[00:02:30]  go to On the Border, Route 1, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  The gang should be there probably shortly, I would assume.  I think they left a little earlier, right?  Cinco de Mayo.  And on the way, Louis Black coming in in 15 minutes, a midget, Crystal Storm, like I said.  Yeah.  But right now, we've got to talk to Mark Burnett.  Do you know who Mark Burnett is, Anthony?  I know he has something to do with the show Survivor.  Yes, he does.  Mark Burnett.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you, sir?  Doing great, man.  Hey, I think we're all owned by the same company. 
[00:03:00]  I think you're right.  Oh, yeah?  We're all selling advertising.  So the show premieres May 31st on CBS.  Of course, we're talking about Survivor.  Survivor.  This show getting a lot of press lately.  Yeah, it seems to have got a lot of press for a long time, you know.  Oh, you've got one of those wacky accents.  Cool.  Wacky.  Actually, I was going to say the same thing to you.  I'm from New Jersey.  Where are you from originally?  I'm originally from London.  London.  Yes.  Okay.  I've got to get over there one of these days. 
[00:03:30]  You want to tell us a little bit about Survivor?  Yes, sure.  I guess most of your listeners know the deal that we took 16 Americans, 8 men, 8 women,  and dropped them on a small island in the middle of the South China Sea  and had them make a world and cooperate together as a tribe,  except that every three days we made them form a tribal council.  And each person made one secret vote against one other person.  No one knew who they voted for. 
[00:04:00]  The person who got the most votes against dropped into the voting bucket  was immediately kicked off the island.  So week by week, one by one, the tribe was shrinking.  We got down to the final two.  We then brought back the seven most recently kicked off by those final two,  and that seven got to choose who was the million-dollar winner.  Wow.  Sounds like a fun little show.  Oh, that wouldn't cause too many issues, though.  I know. 
[00:04:30]  Wouldn't you just be like a brown-noser if you're on the island so they don't vote against you?  You know what?  In real life, think what really happens when someone's an obvious brown-noser.  Think of that.  I think you've seen people fire to the radio station just for being too obvious about kissing ass, you know?  I think you've probably got to be clever and an asset to the rest of the people, you know?  You know, some people tried staying below the radar.  Other people decided to lead from the front.  Other people just decided to work hard.  And other people tried to be goody-two-shoes. 
[00:05:00]  And, you know, I think all of us can see something of ourselves in these people.  But none of us, if we look in the mirror, can say we've always been down the line.  I bet in your career, you couldn't honestly say you've never done anything devious to get where you are.  You couldn't say that.  Oh, yeah.  You're saying nothing, right?  Yeah.  So what are we going to see on a weekly basis?  We're going to see, you know, how these people, very diverse, I mean, as young as 22 and as old as 72. 
[00:05:30]  And the 72-year-old is a retired Navy SEAL, the longest-serving member of the SEAL teams.  Yeah.  Very strong opinions, you know?  He's got a bunch of young kids around him.  Similarly, he's got a woman truck driver.  You know, she's got an accent like Stargo, strong opinions.  Other people are trying to be very, very nice and moral and religious.  And, you know, it's oil and water.  And, however, they have to work together.  What you're going to see on a weekly basis is how that oil and water does or does not mix. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  They've got to search for food together and find water, right?  Yep.  And they've got to even make shelter.  I mean, they arrive on this island on wooden rafts and just hit the shore.  Thick jungle.  I mean, thick, eight-foot snakes.  There are monkeys around.  There are four-foot-long monitor lizards crawling through camp.  They're all bitten by sand fleas and mosquitoes.  And all night long...  Sounds like Sloatsburg. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  There are rats running over them all night long every night.  One woman one night got a rat caught up in her hair.  In the pitch back of the night trying to get a rat out.  I mean, really horrendous experience.  But not one of them complained.  I mean, seriously, they were pretty tough.  Now, did they have to build their own shelters so that they arrived on the island with nothing?  Nothing.  Well, they were, but they got marooned and grabbed a tin of rice that would make one small handful of rice per day, some machetes, some knives, some twine. 
[00:07:00]  So what, do they got to hunt for their own food and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  So they hunted and they hunted rats.  Oh, lagoon.  They hunted rats and rat was the meat they had.  Rat?  Yeah, and then they caught fish for fish.  And obviously, they found this rice root product in the jungle, which is like, I think, called tapioca.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and so they just had to...  They all left around about 30 pounds, I think.  All right, Mark, I got a question for you.  So they arrive on the island.  They don't have shelters.  They're eating rats and snakes and searching for their own food and water and stuff. 
[00:07:30]  And you guys, the film crew, are you all shacked up in nice little huts eating, you know, Subway sandwiches and stuff, watching this mess going on?  It was supposed to be that way.  You know, the big joke I used to make was we're going to survive room service, but actually ended up the catering wasn't all that.  And the crew, I just tell me, they'd much rather be a survivor than not the crew.  That bad, huh?  It was pretty bad for the crew.  There was no hot water. 
[00:08:00]  And it was 70 days, man.  I mean, luckily, I had very tough camera guys.  It worked for me for years.  No phone, no lights, no motor cars, Opie.  Not a single luxury.  Luxury, sure.  Any sex going on?  Any fights?  Yeah, banging.  You mean in the crew or you mean in the survivors?  Oh, really?  The crew was going at it?  Both.  The crew just banging away?  Both.  The crew and the survivors.  Oh, yeah, the survivors.  Some of them started having some sex, huh?  Yep.  Was it all girl on guy and guy on girl, or was it a... 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, that's a good question.  The only ones I know about were the girl and guy.  Oh, yeah?  Did the 72-year-old guy get any piece of ass?  Well, he said he should have brought Viagra as his luxury item.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Navy SEAL don't need sex, Opie.  They could just plant it in a sea urchin.  That's right.  It feels fine.  They learned how to get along.  Mark, Brian on line three says he wants to ask you, he heard the first guy that got kicked  off the island killed himself. 
[00:09:00]  I think that was in the original English version.  Do you think that might have been in the news today?  That was true.  It's funny that only Brian knows about it, right?  Oh, okay.  So, no, that's not true.  Actually, what Brian's referring to is we sold the rights to this idea years ago to Sweden.  They did a show in Sweden, like a little version of this, and that did happen to somebody.  The Swiss are all pussies, though.  Right, right.  They can't take it.  They're not hardened people.  Actually, what the problem was, they put someone who had mental problems on the island, and 
[00:09:30]  they didn't do any sort of background.  Clearly, you know, for an American show on CBS, everyone on the island went through six  and a half hours of written psychological evaluation, the same as if you're going to  be a cop, and then they went through clinical psychologists interviewing them for hours.  Really?  So, we made sure that we didn't have mental patients on the island.  That would have been fun, yeah, and in a couple of homicides.  Mental Maniacs or something.  That's going to be Survivor 2. 
[00:10:00]  You've got to survive against murderers.  Yeah, you've got to.  A bunch of radio guys.  Yeah, we're all savages, that's for sure.  Hey, what happened with this other guy?  It made the post the other day, Richard Hatch.  What about him?  He was on the island for 40 days.  He went back to his home up there in Massachusetts, and then he was like a real ass to his kid  or something.  Well, you know, I know what you're talking about.  I read that.  So, you know, hey, I haven't heard the whole story yet.  I mean, I do know that apparently he made his son go jogging because the kid had put 30 
[00:10:30]  pounds on.  Well, yeah, the kid put on a lot of weight while he was doing the Survivor Series.  He's eating rats.  Yeah.  And his kid's, like, munching out on Twinkies and stuff.  Yeah, so he gets back from the TV show, and he notices his kid, you know, gained a lot  of weight and made him start jogging around.  Yeah, because I know before he went to the island, he had that kid running, you know,  five, six miles a day because of his weight problem.  And then he went away, and the kid didn't keep it up.  So he came back and started back where he left off. 
[00:11:00]  And the kid was, you know, a very clever little kid who made the right complaint and certainly  got himself out of jogging.  But I'm sure that kid now is wondering if he took it too far because now, unfortunately,  his dad's got a lot of his plans to do.  But, hey, it's not really my business, and I don't know the full story.  Yeah.  Hey, was a lot of the crew and the people that put the show together from England?  No, actually, no.  I'm actually an American citizen.  I live in L.A.  Oh, yeah?  So it's a completely American crew.  There was a lot of Australians because we were in Malaysia, and our complete art department 
[00:11:30]  we hired, they just came off Anna and the King, that movie that was shot out there.  Oh, God damn, Anna and the King.  I almost fell asleep on a goddamn airplane from that Anna and the King.  But the sets looked good, didn't they?  Chick flick at 35,000 feet.  Yeah, the set looked great, but the movie blew.  All the carpenters and stuff on that, we hired a ton of those guys from Australia.  It all worked really hard.  All right.  Well, Mark, anything else you could add to this or what?  Watch the show.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. 
[00:12:00]  I've been reading up on this, and it looks like you guys have a pretty good concept there.  Yeah, we have a couple in New York.  Actually, two people from New Jersey and one from New York on the island.  All right.  Cool.  We'll all be checking out the premiere May 31st on CBS.  All right, guys.  It's Survivor and Mark Burnett.  Thank you for spending a few minutes with us today.  We appreciate it.  All right, guys.  Bye.  All right.  There he goes.  Mark Burnett, everyone.  Check out Survivor on CBS May 31st.  Hello.  We're going to torture some Americans. 
[00:12:30]  I'm on an island making me rats, eh?  Come on, Gatner.  I don't think that show's enough.  Hey, really?  I think that's really kind of a sissy show.  I think there should be 12 different islands, and you're on with dogs.  One person and wild dogs and dogs that are rabid.  And the one person who survives makes it, and that's it.  And it's called TS.  Louis Black has entered the studio, Anthony.  We're really doing really well on this.  You know, what's next?  Oh, yeah, boy, this is a good idea.  We're going to censor people to an island, and then we're going to, you know. 
[00:13:00]  You know, for God's sake, it's reality television.  I know.  People love reality TV.  You know, people are just completely lost, okay?  I mean, that's what's going on here.  I mean, you don't have to be a prophet to tell you that something is wrong here.  I end up feeling like a Christian at times.  Have you noticed?  It gives me the willies.  People have lowered the price on their lives, it seems these days.  Because it used to be, for a large sum of money, now a million dollars now is equal to a lot less years ago, 
[00:13:30]  would go on game shows and whatnot, maybe do some wild stuff on beat the clock.  You know, I'll spin a pie on my hand and try to juggle with Marty Feldman for, you know, 15 grand or something.  Now it's getting to the point where it's like, okay, we got this concept.  You walk away from this.  Not guaranteed.  You might get a million bucks.  But you could die.  You could die.  You're going to be like, sign me up. 
[00:14:00]  They had so many people answer this casting call for this thing that people will put a price tag on their lives now for television.  To be on TV.  It's just excitement.  It's going to get crazier and crazier, too, because the whole trend with the Japanese game shows is going to be hitting America's head.  Well, that at least makes sense.  They're just, that's like drugs.  They're insane.  Well, that's beyond.  They have contestants swimming with alligators.  They jump in a pool and have to get to the other side.  And rightfully so.  Right.  Did you see the one where they were freezing? 
[00:14:30]  That's beyond the beyond.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And that's, you know, this is still like within some sort of a context you go, it's wrong.  But when you actually step out and say, gee, somebody had to do a lot of drugs to think of this idea.  Right.  And then to actually perform the act, you'd have to do something.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  It's insane.  The other show, which I saw when I was in Amsterdam, which is, of course, coming here because it's a reality-based show.  It was these guys living in the house.  Yeah.  They have 15 people in a house. 
[00:15:00]  And in Amsterdam, they're saying, this is the difference between us and them.  You win the house.  You know?  Oh, oh.  That was the idea.  Well, here, people would be, you know, then you just go with a knife and gut everybody and go to my house.  I win, you lose.  But they had 15 people in a house, and it was kind of like every week they would vote somebody out.  But they covered everything.  I mean, there's a camera.  The only place you could masturbate was under the bed.  And guys would go say, I'm under the bed.  Yeah, they'd say, you know, I'll masturbate and go under the bed. 
[00:15:30]  Because the bathrooms were all cameras in the bathroom?  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  And then what was great was it was, you know how sick I am.  I yell about this stuff, but I'm sitting in Amsterdam, and I got a show to do that night, and I'm going.  And again, some of the folks I knew, they told me about it.  And I'm sitting there.  I don't understand a word they're saying, and I'm watching it.  Just kind of thinking, this is insane.  And what they're showing, they're bringing it, they change the rules, which is really, I have to say to their credit, completely right up the alley of a game show. 
[00:16:00]  They're down to 12 people, and they decide to keep the show going.  They're down to three people out of 15, and they decide in order to keep the show going, you're going to bring three more on.  Oh, they're just throwing the bed into the neck?  Yeah, they just change the rules.  But so they showed pictures of the people they were thinking of, and the guys were sitting there, like, bring her in.  I wouldn't poke her, so I would give her my big chumstick, and I'm sitting there going, this is unbelievable.  It's just, and we're getting that show, too, apparently.  Oh, great.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I got a great idea for a reality-based show.  You get prisoners that are in for murder, put them in a prison environment, but a studio, you know, television-type prison,  and then the last one alive gets their freedom.  Wouldn't that be great?  I mean, it would totally, wouldn't that be watched?  That would be watched.  All of a sudden, you're watching, like, oh, no, one just got shanked in the yard.  Damn, I was really pulling for him, you know?  Poor man, right.  It's over.  He got shanked.  He got shanked in the yard. 
[00:17:00]  That would be fun.  And another reality-based thing, which I can't wait for, Fox, still trying to pull this off at the FAA,  they want to take a remote-controlled 747 and crash it into the Mojave Desert.  But who's not tuning in?  I know.  Yeah.  I'm there.  And I'd fly all the time, and I'd watch it.  Yeah.  I'm on the plane every other day.  But I think that, you know, they should put people on the plane.  And whoever comes out, the losers from all the reality-based shows, have to then go on the Fox plane  to see if they can get a couple of bucks here and there. 
[00:17:30]  Put Elian Gonzalez's family on that plane.  Yeah, tell them that Fox has to kill them.  Next on Fox, the Gonzalez family plummets for the Desert Four.  Yeah, we'd all tune in for that.  All right, we've definitely got to take a break here.  Lewis, we've got a nice surprise for you outside.  You see that?  I'm a little worried.  I didn't see it.  You didn't see the surprise for you today?  No.  Because you're always fishing and playing.  We never have anything for you.  Oh, God.  We found something for you.  Oh, no.  And you're playing Caroline's this weekend?  I'm playing Caroline's tonight.  Thank God the weather's going to be good. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the last time I saw you, you made me laugh my ass off, but it was a dreary winter  day, and I really felt like driving off the highway on the way home after listening to  you.  Yeah, I mean, I really, I understand.  Real pick-me-up.  Friday, Friday, Saturday, I'm there tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Why go on?  Why go on?  We're all effed as a society.  I was laughing my butt off, but on the way home, driving back from Jersey, it was just  a horrendous night.  I'm like, I've got to have to lose the words.  I'm on a 20-month-old.  Why live? 
[00:18:30]  Why live?  I laugh, but why live?  It's never going to get any better.  Yeah, but that's what's good about it.  At least if you know that's what the deal is, anything you get during the day is kind  of a bonus.  Yeah.  So sunshine should help your ticket sales.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to be out there.  They'll be barbecuing on the sidewalks in this.  Oh, boy.  I can make some tempura right here.  All right.  You're going to be at Caroline's Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  The first show is tonight at 8 o'clock.  8 o'clock.  8 and 10.30.  Yes.  It's both nights tonight and Saturday, and then Sunday, 7.30 and 9.30, if that makes 
[00:19:00]  sense.  Okay?  Yeah.  Quick break, and we're going to be hanging with Louis Black and the lovely and talented  Crystal Storm.  And my Crystal Storm.  Yeah, it could be.  We could be anywhere.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  O.T. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hi, Anthony Fidelity Diamond.  We are doomed.  We love Tom Colosino and the gang at Fidelity Diamond.  Yes.  They helped us out with that WOW sticker stop earlier this week, and they helped you out 
[00:19:30]  also with getting an engagement ring.  Yeah.  Have you done some LSD to the point where you actually think you want to enter the world  of holy matrimony?  If that's the case.  I'm just saying.  Some people might not know, and if you get a roofie slipped to you or something, and all  of a sudden you're walking down the aisle, there's not enough bennies in the world.  But if that happens to you, and you feel the need to enter the wonderful world of marriage, 
[00:20:00]  wait for the drugs to wear off, and then make sure that's something you want to do.  Yes.  But even still, you've got to go to Fidelity Diamond to get your engagement ring there.  The engagement ring specialist, Sophie, they educate you.  Complete education on diamonds.  A lot of people buy diamonds.  They spend a lot of money on diamonds and don't know what they're getting.  Have no clue.  They teach you at Fidelity Diamond about diamonds.  The diamonds are, you pick it out loose.  They're weighed and set while you watch. 
[00:20:30]  None of that slide-a-hand bait-and-switch thing.  Uh-oh, bait-and-switch.  Can I be misconstrued?  Is anything racist?  Bait-and-switch.  No.  No.  And they won't try to chew the price up on you, Opie.  Chew the price up.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's very, yeah, very good prices.  And like I said, you get an education.  If you're going to get engaged, go to the engagement ring specialist.  Fidelity Diamond.  I could sum it up, Anthony.  Okay.  You walk out of Fidelity Diamond, you know you didn't get ripped off. 
[00:21:00]  Ripped off.  A lot of people in the city, you know, they go into some of these diamond places.  They get their diamond.  They walk out.  They're unsure.  They're like, was I just taken?  I don't know.  I feel like you got gypped.  Right.  Oh, Fidelity Diamond has been doing this for, what, they're in their 18th year now.  Yeah.  You will not get ripped off at Fidelity Diamond.  Give them a call, 201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555.  Fidelity Diamond is located on Route 17 South in Paramus, just minutes from Manhattan and 
[00:21:30]  Rockland County.  The Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whoreshop.  By 7 o'clock, I think you're going to say, you know what, I had a pretty good time today.  All right, it's F.U. Friday.  We're hanging out with Louis Black from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Back in black.  You're still doing that, Louis?  Yeah.  Every Wednesday?  Every Wednesday.  I did a very good job at that.  Really?  I have my second special for Comedy Central.  Tuesday at 10 o'clock. 
[00:22:00]  Like your stand-up and stuff?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  I did not know that.  I'd recommend everyone check that out on TV or go to Caroline's tonight.  A couple shows happen at 8 o'clock and 10.30.  You're there all weekend long, so just call Caroline's and find out what show's best for  you.  Right, Ant?  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  Yeah.  Now, you work over there at Comedy Central.  Yes.  You know Ben Stein at all?  Oh, yeah.  We have to talk to you about this.  I bumped into this man.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I heard this story.  Yeah, he's a fucking loaded thing, man.  I heard about Chew Me Down. 
[00:22:30]  Chew Me Down.  So, I just ran into him the other day and I'd forgotten this, uh...  I forgot because I would have grabbed him and said, uh, Ben, are you insane?  That's what I asked him.  I mean, that's when he hung up.  Well, you've got to realize, and this is a man who, uh, who worked with Nixon.  Nixon.  Oh, my Jew boys.  That's what Nixon used to say.  So, what would Chew Me Down be?  I mean, there's nothing on the scale of Nixon.  You know what the funniest part is?  I didn't even say that.  I know you didn't say that.  I said, Chew Me Down.  Well, who would have a commercial with Chew Me Down? 
[00:23:00]  I love the, uh, yes.  We hear it.  Nazi, uh, farm equipment.  Nazi auto.  Yeah.  Would like to...  Chew you down.  Chew you down.  No, it's like ridiculous.  I was like a man.  Yeah.  I just heard that.  And then he hung up.  Yeah.  I'm going to hang up.  Yeah.  Chew me down.  I know you said...  Oh, and then I'm saying his television show, really breaking down the barriers there.  It's a Jewish guy doing at all costs to keep you from getting his money. 
[00:23:30]  Win my money.  I'll do anything in my power to keep my money out of your hand.  I mean, it's very true.  It's unbelievable.  I was like, but it would be...  But it's perfect, Ben.  It's like...  Yeah.  Is that what he's like?  He's a little wacky.  He's wacky.  I mean, look at...  You know, he's walking around in a suit with sneakers.  I ditched that 20 years ago.  You see the pictures of him from the 60s?  He's got the big, long hair, the beard.  It's like he used to smoke weed.  And then he's with Nixon.  How the hell did that happen? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Hey, hey, Ben.  Where's my head Jew boy?  You know, G. Gordon Liddy never tried to Jew me down on a price for breaking into the water gate.  Well, you know, I did that show, and I did Ben Stein's Money, and I got nothing right.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Those are some tough questions.  And then I buzzed the first one, and you're sitting there, and plus, it's a real, you know,  everybody goes, oh, yeah, you know, you get out there, you should be, it'll be easy.  It's not, you know, you're out there, it's like stupid. 
[00:24:30]  It's like, it's completely, you feel like a moron.  It takes you right back to everything you feared about school.  All right.  Hey, I'm going to raise my hand first, which is wrong.  It's so wrong.  It took me three years, you know, so that I could actually have a social life.  Oh, no, call on me.  Call on me.  So now I'm back there, and it's like the first question, I can't do the buzzer.  It's up with this form.  Everybody's going, come on, we're going to practice the buzzer, and I can't do it, okay?  That's why I can't play video games.  It's like pathetic, you know? 
[00:25:00]  You know, being Jewish, I've got no mechanical skills.  You don't have the hand-eye information going on, huh?  By the grace of God, I can wipe myself properly.  So I'm like sitting there, and I couldn't do it.  And then when the first question comes up, I go, bam!  And I realize that the answer, while he's reading it, but the question is that my answer is in the question,  so how can the answer be right?  And I'm going, oh, man, and that's the end of the show for me.  And he looks, he says, you answered, and I said, I have absolutely no answer. 
[00:25:30]  I'm an idiot.  And the other two guessed, and I said, well, at least I had the courage not to guess.  And then when I actually knew the answers, I couldn't get back online, and then it was like, goodbye, Lewis.  You're just done.  And so I said, you know, that I was actually thrown, it's because I had some auditions to go to.  Yeah, there you go.  But I said it would have been more fun, really, and less shameful of, it would be a less shameful incident for me and my family  if I just appeared on stage in khakis and peed myself. 
[00:26:00]  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, I guess they're not going to be calling you for who wants to be a millionaire, I guess.  Well, that I could do.  Because that's the first five questions, you know, pretty easy.  Like, they've got to get rid of the first five questions.  It's just like, come on.  And then some of them, it's really, you go right through it, and it's like nothing.  And some of them, it's like, you know, what movie was Macbeth based on?  Or what movie used Macbeth as a theme? 
[00:26:30]  And then there's four movies you've never even heard the name.  You know, but the question before was, the splendid splinter was who?  You know, Frank Casaro, Boo Boo Snits Snits, Kiki Key, or Ted Williams.  It's like unbelievable, that show.  And it's really much destroyed any possibility of me having a sitcom ever.  Yeah.  Well, between that and the reality shows, what have I been doing?  Those are doing well.  Like, Regis is pulling in a 25 share. 
[00:27:00]  All the roofs in the Midwest love that stuff.  You know, it's a great, I also figured it out when I'm traveling around the Midwest before I go to do gigs and stuff.  It's just, it's a phenomenal bar show.  Oh, right.  These guys sit in the bar, I don't know that.  I got it.  Are you kidding me?  You idiot.  That's funny, because Jeopardy is just like that, too.  You know, it's a bar show.  They're all arguing, I don't know that one.  And then the guy that gets upset because you're sitting in the bar and you didn't say, what is.  You didn't phrase it in the form of a question.  Like, all right, Alex Trebek, finish your frigging CC and water and shut up. 
[00:27:30]  And then you get Alex Trebek, you know, yelling about the millionaire show.  I mean, it's like, come on.  Yes, very upset.  I wish the two of them would wrestle.  And then Regis now has a clothing line.  Regis.  Yeah, he does.  I mean, how far gone are we?  Oh, you have a cry.  I want to look like Regis.  Who wants to look like Regis?  You know, you might say, okay, that's a nice tie.  I'll wear that when I got to hang myself.  Such a final answer. 
[00:28:00]  But, I mean, how do you end up with a suit?  How do you end up?  How could that be a clothing line?  It used to be they would give you, if you did a stage work or something, you might get a shot at a TV show.  Now it's just all the plugs are pulled.  Toys, action figures, clothing lines, nail clippers, anything that they could attach your name to.  Who wants to look like Regis?  One of my agents yesterday was talking to somebody about this.  Has anyone discussed with Louis, you know, the merchandising? 
[00:28:30]  Then I went, what?  What am I going to merchandise you?  That's a big negotiation point these days.  The Lou Black he used to wear, then when he was a kid, yarmakus?  What am I going to, what can I possibly, what am I going to sell?  Merchandising.  Merchandising.  All right, you want to bring in Crystal Storm, Anthony?  Are we going to go with Crystal here now?  Well, we have a little surprise for Louis.  Let's see.  A little surprise.  Don't worry, Louis.  Let me say something to you.  Because I understand, because I'm the same way. 
[00:29:00]  I don't like when people bring in these girls because they're going to maul me or something.  You don't have to worry about that.  We won't have you maul.  Look.  Look at them.  Hi.  How are you doing, Crystal?  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  Good.  Louis, her eyes are up there.  I know.  It's astonishing.  That's another level.  See, that's a different level.  It is.  It is just off the frigging charts.  What size are those, Beauty?  121 triple X.  Who measures that? 
[00:29:30]  Louis, by the way, she's your competition in the city tonight.  Is that right?  Yeah, she's right down the road.  It's me or you.  I would say I would get out there and see these.  You guys want to fight over the plugs?  Please be my guest.  I just realized that.  That's funny.  That's easy.  But I think it's a different audience.  Yeah, it could be.  You could time it.  You could check out Boobs and then go see Louis.  Yeah, it's not far.  I think the showtimes work out just about perfect.  Yeah, the showtimes do. 
[00:30:00]  You go see Crystal Storm at Flash Dancers.  It's right down the street.  52nd and Broadway at 6 o'clock.  You're on stage for what, a half hour or so?  Yeah.  And then you go see Louis Black at Caroline's for an 8 o'clock lap dance.  You know what your lovely cans remind me of?  Remember that episode of Star Trek when they went to Talos?  The ass-headed aliens.  Remember that?  Captain Christopher Pike, remember?  And they make him feel like he can walk again. 
[00:30:30]  It looks like you have two of those aliens' heads in your shirt.  I think we took a picture like that with one of the guys.  Yeah, they're huge.  We have a midget coming in today.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Can I borrow one?  Yeah.  I'm sure you'd love it if you just put his huge cans on his head or something.  That would be relieving.  Well, you want to show Louis your cans or what?  Is he for rent?  Louis?  No, the midget.  No, the midget.  The midget.  Louis always.  Louis, do you?  Are you for rent? 
[00:31:00]  You should bring the midget on stage tonight, Louis.  Louis.  Crystal, show them your cans, man.  Okay.  Yeah, this is great.  This is just an exercise in stress.  How do you do that?  Isn't that amazing?  How do you do that?  I mean, that's a lot to carry around.  You are carrying around.  How much do they weigh?  They're about 20 pounds each.  20 pounds a piece.  Wow.  I can barely carry a briefcase.  Yeah.  I close it with her all the time.  Hey, how about tell them about your bed? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, I have bed special needs.  It's got a hole cut into it.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you just be under the bed all the time?  Watching them hanging down in your bed?  I should have it redone with, like, plastic sea-throes.  Oh, plexiglass.  Very nice.  That would be kind of cool.  Have people take a little conveyor belt under your bed.  They could just lay there while you sleep.  They can charge for chores.  You can make money.  Is this done?  Did you do this just over one time?  Oh, that's natural.  That's natural.  If that's natural, then I'm going to have to be hospitalized on Jupiter. 
[00:32:00]  Actually, I grew up next to a nuclear power plant.  Yeah.  You've got to watch that.  Yeah, you obviously had those implants.  Yeah, when you start eating three-foot-long green beans, you know, something's going to happen.  But you had really big cans to start with, right?  Yeah.  That was an F-cup, naturally.  An F-cup.  And now she's a Z.  121?  121.  They call it an F-cup because when she took a shirt off, any guy she was with went,  Oh! 
[00:32:30]  So, Rose, you must have a question for her.  She's topless there.  Huge cans.  They're bigger than your head.  And what could my question be?  What do you think about Elian Gonzalez?  That's where he's hiding.  Max Leeson.  I could see Reno going, trying to extricate him from her cleavage.  Those are something.  You can see those. 
[00:33:00]  What possessed you?  You just, I mean, is it, what possessed you to say, I'm going to go from, you know, insane  to beyond psychotic?  Actually, I said, well, that's not much bigger than I am already.  Really?  But it was.  It's better.  No, it's kind of been bigger than what you were.  I have disease.  I said everybody already stares anyhow.  How much worse can it get?  And it got a lot worse than this.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just huge.  That's bizarre.  Yeah, that is really huge.  And what age did you start developing? 
[00:33:30]  About nine.  Nine?  I was a D-cup by 12.  I didn't even know I had a headache.  Nine years old.  I was a D-cup by 12.  It was hard in school.  Twelve?  You were a D-cup?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Could you imagine?  Some little boys liked me and others really thought I had a lot of cooties.  Yeah.  Oh, cooties.  We're over here.  We've got to watch the cooties.  That's right.  I would have been weeping. 
[00:34:00]  I would have had to go home from school.  I don't know what's going on, Mommy.  I feel funny, but I don't know why when I look at her.  Well, that's towards you, though, in a school.  It could be, yeah.  Well, with a maturity of men, it must have been, you know, a cooties.  It must have been a real treat.  It was interesting.  That's a show.  What do you have in your hand?  I have something I think that they used with, you know, the saline.  Ah.  Don't ask me why.  I actually need a rain belt.  It's eyewash.  And I just...  How much is it? 
[00:34:30]  Well, it was here originally.  So I didn't like to say, hey, guys, you know what I brought for you today?  A little eyewash.  But I think I need them now.  Now, those are also not the silicone or saline.  Were yours the string?  No.  No.  That was someone else.  That was another big-breasted woman.  String?  You've heard about the string thing?  I don't think I want to hear.  They put string in, like a big baseball.  Do you ever unwrap a baseball or a golf ball?  Yes, they do.  That's how they make, yeah, string. 
[00:35:00]  They just quit doing it.  They don't do the string anymore?  Yeah.  Well, let's say, why don't we just...  It's kind of cool, though.  But it's wrong.  You're putting a foreign object into your body.  I don't think the body goes, oh, boy, I got a baseball in it now.  You know?  I think the way it works is the body goes, ha-ha, this is an emergency situation.  You know?  Out.  Out.  Yeah.  Silly string boobs.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be funny?  You're walking around, someone goes, I think you got a thread from your shirt hanging 
[00:35:30]  there.  Let me pull that out.  And all of a sudden, it turns into a magic trick.  You just keep pulling it until different colored scarves are coming out.  Well, beautiful.  You can see those where tonight?  At Flash Dancers on Broadway and 52nd across from David Letterman.  Right next to Caroline.  Yeah, right next to Caroline.  Down the street.  There's a guy on the line.  He's taking the whole bachelor party to see Louis Black. 
[00:36:00]  Steve.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  You're taking the bachelor party to see Louis?  Yeah.  Well, Steve, I deeply appreciate that.  Only one of us.  Now, where were you dancing, young lady?  Where are we going to go first?  It's right down the street.  It's all eight.  All right, wait a minute.  You've got to see Louis Black first.  Oh, of course.  All right.  Louis at 8 o'clock.  Crystal at midnight tonight.  All right.  How's that sound?  That sounds great.  Yeah, it's right up the street.  All right.  I was playing off with your buddy last night, Louis.  Joe Bacoli. 
[00:36:30]  No.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks.  Have a good one, guys.  Thanks.  Thanks for having a conversation that two people cared about.  We were really teaching that.  Hey, Crystal, do you have any breast tricks today?  What kind of stupid breast tricks do you have in mind?  You probably thought up a few in your day, right?  Yeah.  What can you do with those?  Louis, would you like to see a breast trick, Louis?  Right now, it's a breast trick. 
[00:37:00]  Could you hold that bottle of saline underneath your breast?  No problem.  Really?  That's easy.  That's easy.  You must have a really good breast trick we can do for Louis.  Oh, yeah.  I can't even begin to describe for the audience out there what I just saw.  How come it's so quiet in here?  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Yes, Dr. Smith.  You know, that's actually Jonathan Harris, Dr. Zachary Smith. 
[00:37:30]  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Oh, dear.  Look at that, you bubble-breasted boobie.  Now, does it like being that size, does that help you in the business?  Yeah, I guess so.  Does it?  She works for NASA.  I understand what business you're talking about, baby.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, so I guess there's a premium. 
[00:38:00]  These are kind of like an OG in my business.  Yeah, a little premium paid for that.  You make a little more than the normal dancer.  Yeah, you have.  Yeah, you're like a featured act.  Right.  Very cool.  And guys, do they enjoy that in this act?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  You got a boyfriend or are you just like...  Not yet.  I'm working on it.  Oh, yeah?  What is it?  Just a fun sex party every night with you?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A lot of work.  A lot of...  A lot of...  A lot of work, a lot of traveling.  A lot of...  You know how to.  T-F-ing. 
[00:38:30]  You know how to.  Like, that would be my first thought if I ever got in bed with you.  Before, like, round zero, I go, I need a good T-F.  A T-F-ing.  Well, I keep snorkels on my nightstand.  There you go.  As my son, Philippe, dives into the crevasse.  Let's get the crocodile hunter in there.  Oh, crocodile.  Yes. 
[00:39:00]  Craig, what's up?  Yeah.  I want to know, what goes through the mind of the doctor when he puts those bad boys in there?  Yeah, you've got to figure there must be an ethical question here.  If a doctor is willing to do something that some may see as deforming you.  Right.  That's what happened, actually.  Oh.  I wonder what happens if he drops it on the ground.  And does it go?  Like a water balloon.  Now, they're pretty strong.  Yeah.  But he has no...  A legitimate doctor did this? 
[00:39:30]  He didn't have to go to Tijuana?  No, no, no.  A couple of chihuahuas in there?  They did...  Like, I had mine done a while ago.  Yeah.  And they have been outlawed because they did feel it was deformity.  Yeah.  So, like for myself, if I ever had a problem...  Don't figure.  I was thinking of going to a doctor and getting a Buick put in my pants.  But the doctor that did mine was going to do a girl with one big boob, like a watermelon.  Stop it.  Just stop it.  For the circus. 
[00:40:00]  It's true.  For the circus.  Perfect.  She was going to have one boob across her chest.  One boob across her chest.  Just one big implant, like a watermelon.  Right.  And he wouldn't let them do it.  And what about nips?  Where would they be?  Oh, I don't know.  There was going to be one or two.  Maybe just a cyclops one.  Probably one.  You've got to go the distance.  I think that would be the case.  My agent was going to...  Louis, you're right.  You've got to go the distance.  If you're going to get one big watermelon boob, you've just got to put a cyclops nipple  right in the middle of the thing.  Right in the middle.  Which is wrong?  They just throw a baby bottle nipple on there.  And they said no?  They wouldn't do it. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, that's too bad.  I knew a good doctor that was really pretty good at doing things like that.  A Mengele?  You ever hear of him?  I think he's out of business now, but he used to do things sort of like that.  Hey, stop it.  Not funny.  All right, well, we've got to take a break.  We're waiting for the midget to show up.  Where is that guy?  I'm waiting for that.  Yeah, I've got to see if you can pick up a midget with those things.  Just lock his head under there and lift him right up off the ground. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  So you're going to be sticking around for a while, right, Crystal?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a little bit longer.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, you've got to be out of here soon.  You've got a 6 o'clock show tonight.  Oh, right down the road.  You could just jog there.  Oh, yeah, right.  Back in the hospital, it's Crystal.  Bruises and contusions from her short jog.  Uh-uh.  I'm cruising the city on a moped.  Isn't that cool?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  God, how many crashes do you cause?  Imagine seeing that guy.  You'd never guess what I just saw. 
[00:41:30]  I believe I saw Curly from the Three Stooges and Telly Savalas with a girl on their back riding a moped.  All right.  Listen, Crystal Storm's going to be at Flash Dancers tonight and tomorrow.  She's sticking around for a little longer.  We're hoping this midget shows up and we'll do something stupid, that's for sure.  Okay?  Yeah, that's guaranteed on this friggin' show.  All right.  Stay there.  It's not as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks. 
[00:42:00]  Great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and that ain't my new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Hopefully you have them for me.  What a couple of ass-wives.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  We love it.  We go down there all the time.  Somebody from the show is there trying to get a free meal off of Joey.  I think every night.  Just about.  Great food.  Relaxed atmosphere.  You want to take a date of the family to a nice Italian restaurant right there on Mulberry Street in Little Italy. 
[00:42:30]  You go to Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Then the new menu, you know what's on there?  Huh?  Huh?  Look at the appetizer section.  Crystal Storm's boobs?  Yes.  Crystal Storm's huge meatballs, they're called.  They're giant-sized meatballs covered with the Paisano sauce.  It's wonderful.  Large portions like Crystal Storm's breasts.  Huge.  Huge.  Yeah.  Huge.  Family dish.  Huge proportions.  I mean, huge portions, yes.  Milk-fed veal.  You got that there. 
[00:43:00]  That was great.  And someone wants to know if you put deodorant under your breasts.  Wow, the midget's here.  Deodorant.  Rock.  Deodorant under the breast.  No.  Sorry.  There's too much going on.  You do not put deodorant under your...  Uh-uh.  Okay.  There's a midget outside.  I'm sorry.  We got to get through the Paisano reading.  We'll get the midget in.  This is a three-ring circus today.  Well, like I said, great food.  Incredible lunch specials.  Pasta lunch specials.  Go down there for that.  And in the appetizer section, Anthony's fried ravioli. 
[00:43:30]  Because that's my favorite appetizer.  And then you go down to the bottom of the menu, and what do you have?  Uh, something with my name on it.  You don't even know what your thing is?  You're on the menu at Paisano.  You don't even know what it is?  I'm barely on the menu.  I'm like the last line.  But it's a main thing.  And the menus, when the menus are misprinted, it doesn't...  It's not even on half the menus.  Eggplant Parmesan.  Of course.  You just mess with Joe.  Oh, yes.  So you are.  Parmesan.  You're so full of it.  You didn't know what you were on the menu.  I did know.  I can't believe it.  I did know.  It's come to this. 
[00:44:00]  It really has.  It's come to this.  And when did they break up?  It was over the menu.  It was over the Paisano menu.  The deals were cut everything, but it was that Paisano menu that tore them apart.  I was trying to down...  I wanted to be the ZD.  Right.  Yeah, so check it out.

This is your announcer, Hugh Mungusbecker, saying...  Boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie, boopie.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.

This is messed up.  All right.  Get up on that chair.  Now, first, I've got to get the terminology right, Opie.  Little people, sir.  Little people.  Little people, sir.  Just little people.  Little people. 
[00:46:00]  I like saying midget, though.  That's like calling a black man a...  The N-word?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Midget?  Is that bad?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I know.  I just took your hat from on top of the computer monitor.  Syndication now, boys.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Let's go.  Hey, what's your name, man?  Scott.  Hey, Scott.  Nice to meet you.  All right.  How's it going?  That's Crystal Storm, and that's Lois Black.  Let me shake your hand on your breasts.  What's up, Crystal?  Hey, you do.  What do you think of her boobs there?  All right.  What do you mean, all right?  A little bone tonight?  I don't want to.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  I'll throw you down for a good one.  Wow.  Strike you or stay you.  What do you want to do?  The little person has some sharps to him.  Well, I don't know qualms about being little, you know?  Hey, you never know.  He might be hung like a horse.  By the way, I heard you want to rent me.  Oh, yeah.  I don't come cheap.  No, huh?  No.  I don't come cheap.  I don't get short wages either.  Yeah, we need the...  So, everything, as she was asking, everything else of normal size when you're a person? 
[00:47:00]  We got the thing between your legs pretty normal.  Everything's pretty cool.  I got a life.  Is it to scale or...  Yeah, is it to scale or is it to...  It's not the motion of the ocean.  What do you mean?  Is it to scale?  Is it, like, big for the size of you or is it big for the size of anybody?  It's big for the size of anybody.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I'm just wondering because that would be the Lord's little joke, you know?  I'll just make it...  I'll make it seem really big for just him. 
[00:47:30]  No problem.  How tall are you?  4'2".  4'2"?  Yeah.  I could have been 6'3", but I turned it down.  He's a regular comedian.  How's that?  You want to punch a spaz in the ambit?  I call him.  If he touches me, I'm arresting him for child...  Child touching.  Child touching.  He's going to have to register in Sloatberg.  I have to sit in a child, you know.  Yeah?  I go to amusement parks.  Yeah, I got to...  Yeah, you have it not fit underneath the little hand?  Child's head?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm all right.  I'm pretty cool with that. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  I got the mustache going, so...  Don't give me a hard time.  Don't come off.  How old a guy are you?  41.  41?  Yeah.  I can't tell his age.  And...  Look at Chris looking at me.  Ooh.  I like this guy.  He's got some strong.  I don't know qualms, man.  All right.  And you got a wife and a kid.  A wife and a kid.  So give a shout-out to my wife, Joanne, and baby Amanda.  All right.  Now, is Joanne a...  Average-sized person.  Average-sized person.  How tall is she?  5'3".  Is that average size?  Yeah, that's average size. 
[00:48:30]  That's average size.  5'3".  Got the baby, 2 years old.  Almost up to my waist now.  Really?  She'll be outgrown me soon.  How'd you meet?  You were behind her in the movie line, and that was considered sex?  I'm just figuring, you know, from a height standpoint, if she turned around and said hi  to a friend, all of a sudden he's in it.  Oh, by the way, Anthony, I got some new news for you.  What?  The Parrish family, we're getting back together.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow.  I heard you like the, you know, the Parrish family.  Okay, terrific.  You were doing so well.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:49:00]  The Parrish family, the monkey.  There we go.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow.  Hey, can we get some pictures with Crystal and you?  Sure.  You'll be famous.  You'll be all over the website.  No.  You've got to, like, make the boob hat on our friend.  Yeah, we've got to see how it works out.  All right.  What are we doing?  It's fun.  What are we going to do?  It's the J-Moist.  No, they do it right.  Everything is done right here in the studio.  Yes.  No, the J-Moist.  Sweetest.  You want to go in the J-Moist?  That's a nice name for the bathroom, sir. 
[00:49:30]  Wow, yeah, look at that.  Wow, you've got perfect.  Hold on, you've got to get.  Yeah, he looks like Mickey.  All right, you've got to.  Yeah, because it looks like he's kneeling, but he's not.  That is bizarre.  Her boobs are on his head.  This is why I don't do drugs anymore.  This is the kind of, I can't even cope with this.  This would have freaked you out on anything.  On anything.  On too much NyQuil, this freaks you out where you might jump out a window.  Make it eyes on him. 
[00:50:00]  I like the, make the boobs like his eyes.  That's a funny shot.  This is a really good one.  How do you do that?  You'll see.  You'll see.  Oh, really?  You know, I'm surprised you haven't gotten into directing.  Yeah.  No, you'll see.  This is really funny.  Oh, I see.  This is why I did my 208.  It's back in 68.  He's a comedian, man.  This is funny.  This is so wrong. 
[00:50:30]  Snap a couple of pictures.  There we go.  They're having a little photo shoot over there.  Go ahead and wait.  You're going to want to go on the website to see this, and it will not do it justice.  I know.  You really should have seen it in three dimensions.  And what do you do for a living there?  My wife's a saint.  She'll be with me for life.  What do you do?  I work in a nursing home.  I'm associate director of recreation.  I run programs, set up trips, parties.  For nursing homes?  Nursing home?  Yeah.  Can you take my parents?  I'm serious.  We're looking.  Brooklyn, New York.  Born and raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. 
[00:51:00]  Is that right?  Yeah.  That must freak out the old people, though.  They must always be like, finally my grandchildren's come to visit me.  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  The only thing I'm their grandkids.  I'm in everybody's will.  I didn't see nothing yet.  Yeah, I think you need him tonight, Lewis.  He's going to be opening up the Lewis flag at Caroline's.  At Caroline's tonight.  I could have.  No, it's tonight.  It will be fine, but it's about 10 or 20 nights on the road where I go, I'm going to have to call you.  You should see the people who work in front of me sometimes. 
[00:51:30]  I'm in a book.  You're a child of average?  You're going to be of average size?  Really?  Yes, sir.  Were your parents average size?  Yes.  What the hell happened?  I don't know, dude.  I don't know.  Maybe a gene or something.  Yeah, huh?  Maybe something got skipped.  A fish went one way, and then one fish went...  I don't know.  All of a sudden...  I don't know where they went.  Do you have one of those sisters?  They have two sisters.  Are they?  You'll see them at the wedding.  What's going on?  Don't worry. 
[00:52:00]  I'll be there.  Do you do comedy on the side or what?  No, it's fine.  Is that right?  You're doing pretty well.  No kidding.  It's funny.  No one knows what to say because she goes, are they...  Huh?  Normal?  Normal?  You're average size people living in an average size world.  If you say normal, it implies that you're not normal.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm pretty wet, though.  In the head, I would say, yeah, you're not normal.  Nah.  I'm not perfect, you screws loose.  Syndication now. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  But you're obviously what they would consider dwarf.  I'm a little person.  A dwarf is one of those seven...  The other six guys.  I don't know, because they say dwarfism.  I know that.  I jump ship.  I think a midget...  Midget is like the little rascals.  Remember those kids?  Fidget.  They were called fidgets?  Fidgets.  Them's not babies.  Them's fidgets.  Yeah.  They didn't shoot off the camera.  He locked them in that music park thing that...  In that door.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And they were stealing the women's jewelry. 
[00:53:00]  They'd go, ma-ma, ma-ma.  And they'd jump up and down.  And the jewelry would fall off.  And they'd run under the dress, grab it, and go, hey, scram.  Scram.  That's what I like with Stanky, when he's babysitting the kids.  And he loses control, so he glues them to the floor.  Remarkable.  He puts cages over their heads.  That was awesome.  This is scary, listening.  That scary was the first thing.  This is a little scarier.  Going down memory lane with you two, actually remembering everything from the little rascals. 
[00:53:30]  I remember it.  I can't quote it.  I remember being there.  I can name the characters.  The one thing is a little spook.  My life was watching television.  It was nice, too, but I don't remember.  I remember them being there, but I can't remember them.  Oh, no.  Oh, I was absorbing everything.  Everything.  That was an awesome show.  It was a great show.  Well, a bunch of people want to talk to you, Scott.  Peter, what's going on?  How you doing?  I think this guy is the eighth dwarf.  Horny.  Peter...  He's pretty funny, isn't he? 
[00:54:00]  He's unbelievable.  Someone wants to know if you can reach your yam bag with your hand.  Is it a female or a male?  It's dice.  Yeah, right.  Reach whose yam bag?  I'm over here now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, look.  A midget's imitating me.  Did you hear him talking about little people?  Yeah, when they go to heaven, do they get special wings?  Yeah.  I heard the whole thing.  What do they do for a living?  You put them on a stick and have them clean the hard-to-reach corners? 
[00:54:30]  That's what the dice man was saying.  Dice is from my hometown.  Brooklyn, man.  Oh, yeah.  Brooklyn, New Jersey.  Dice would like everyone to believe he's from Brooklyn.  Dice is from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Hey, Mitch.  Before, when the continents were all one, before they divided.  I used to see him in Pips in Sheepshead Bay.  What, his crotch?  Oh, come on.  Hey, Mitch.  Mitch, what's up?  I just wanted to comment.  You guys have an intelligent woman with a hundred-sized breast and a damn funny midget. 
[00:55:00]  Only on the opening anthony show can you find these two things together.  And for the first time, Louis Black speechless.  Well, I think he was speechless last time when he got the lap dance, if I'm not mistaken.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, no, that was right.  But still, a very unique combination, and only through you guys.  I appreciate it.  All right, Mitch.  Syndication on the ground.  All right.  All right.  That's my line.  Louis, speechless today, huh?  I'm stunned.  I'm stunned.  You know, I just got off a plane.  I was in Los Angeles yesterday, yesterday morning, and now I'm here, and it's really... 
[00:55:30]  Oh, Los Angeles.  Nothing but freaks and nuts there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, you know, but then to come home and to still be with freaks and nuts, it was...  I can't, and I couldn't...  It was horrible.  Really?  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, what kind of a job do I have where you get on a...  You're basically being paid to fly in a plane.  Yeah, that's it.  You will sit on this plane for six hours and come here and work for 20 minutes, and then  get on the plane the next morning, and we're going to get you just enough sleep so that 
[00:56:00]  you'll be awake during the entire flight.  And the pilot's making a lot more than you.  Oh, the pilot's making...  Everybody's making a lot more.  You know, and you feel like, you know, you'd just rather just...  Can I serve with you?  Can I...  I'll serve food today.  And it doesn't matter.  The plane seats are designed for people who...  Basically for people who have scoliosis.  It's designed by somebody who had scoliosis, and they're the only person...  I just think they should have sticks.  Sticks? 
[00:56:30]  No seats.  As long as it's going to be painful, let's go the whole way.  Sit on a stick.  It's just you sit on a stick, and it's up your butt.  Somehow I think you can relate to the guy in Continental that was up on top of the food  cart.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Taking a dump on the food cart.  He lost his mind.  You must be something when you get on a plane, huh?  I have to take two seats.  They take a look at you, right?  Do you really need two seats?  Yeah, two seats.  One for each.  He sits in first class and second class.  Kevin, what's going on? 
[00:57:00]  Ladies and gentlemen...  Hold on, Kevin.  Hold on.  ...to the left side of the aircraft.  You'll see, holy Jesus Palomino, look at the size of those cans.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, how are you today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, it's Tony, not Kevin.  All right.  What's up, Tony?  I don't know where you guys got that one from.  Listen, I got a question for Scott.  No.  Scott, when you're in an elevator, somebody rips a fart.  Does your hat fly off?  Actually, yeah, you just pull off now.  It's right here.  I'm over here.  You're insane. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  Indication on the ground, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kristen.  Kristen, how are you?  Hey, Kristen.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  Actually, I just wanted to make a comment about how Scott was talking about his penis  being really large.  Yeah.  My fiancÃ©'s a dwarf, and he's really large, too.  What's her name?  So I think it's like a really common thing.  How did you hook up?  Oh, we met through, like, a mutual friend, and we just started seeing each other, and  then, like, when we got sexual, I was shocked at the size of his penis, so I just wanted to 
[00:58:00]  mention that.  Now, how tall are you?  I'm 5'4".  And how tall is he?  He had surgery to actually make himself taller, so he's actually 5'2".  How do you do that?  That's not good.  What do you do that for?  Do you break your legs?  What do you do?  Yeah, yeah, break your legs.  Oh, my God.  And then they start stretching it and adding some bone in there and Legos or whatever you  need to shim it up with some shingles.  That's what he's doing.  So when you guys are toes to toes, his nose is in it, and when you're nose to nose, his 
[00:58:30]  toes is in it?  Yeah, pretty much.  Maybe we'd double date one night.  My wife...  What?  You could get on your shoulders.  Yeah.  I just wanted to make that comment because I thought it was pretty cool.  All right.  You think it's cool that he has a huge penis?  Yeah, I really think it's really cool.  Is that a huge penis in comparison to his size or a huge penis?  No, it's really, like, a larger penis than any other guys I've ever seen. 
[00:59:00]  Really?  How about that?  Don't worry.  You'll see it on the honeymoon.  You'll see.  Don't worry.  Wedding night, don't worry.  After we get all the money, don't worry.  There we go.  All right, Kristen, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Now the phone's just going nuts.  How come a lot of little people...  There you go.  I was going to say midget.  Midget.  How come a lot of little people, you never see them hooking up as husband and wife?  Usually it is a little person and an average-sized person.  I live in an average world, so I want to be an average-sized girl. 
[00:59:30]  You sure?  It's not like...  It's an average world.  You don't look at a little person woman and go, pff, I ain't getting on that.  Do you know many little girls?  Little girls.  Yeah, I know a lot of little girls.  I think Stas knows more than me.  I get in trouble.  I know.  I think there's an organization called Little People of America.  Yeah.  Right.  They're like four foot ten and under.  They turn you on, though?  No.  Little person, Bob?  You get to meet other people.  Yeah, like conventions and we go on trips.  That's pretty cool.  Different cities around the world.  Yeah.  You guys know Billy Barty, right? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  Have you done any acting or anything?  Yeah, I do a lot.  Conan O'Brien and...  Oh, yeah?  Another guy I won't mention because you guys are in...  Hey, I think I remember you.  Did you call in?  You called us like a year and a half ago.  A long time ago.  So, we were trying to find the most famous person listening to our show.  Were you the little person that called us?  That was on the Conan O'Brien show?  No.  No.  Okay.  Did you guys have a thing about a suit one time?  I want to buy a dwarf suit. 
[01:00:30]  Some do.  Buy a dwarf suit.  Yeah, I don't know why.  It's like some problem.  These guys would not do that.  I'm going to buy a dwarf baseball bat and a baseball team and then I'm going to...  Anything about a suit.  Another country and then they'll play baseball every year and we'll get a report.  That's not a suit.  That's not a suit.  All right, wrong station.  That's not a suit.  Let's go to John.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Yeah.  How are you?  Fine.  I want an axe.  Axe.  The little guy, did he ever get picked on in school?  No.  I was always protected in school. 
[01:01:00]  People watch me like a...  Like a...  Like a...  Like a...  Like a buddy.  Like a buddy.  Oh, yeah?  Cool.  I never got picked on.  Crystal with the huge boobs out once...  Is it custom-made?  No.  The waist is cool.  Just like the bottoms, the long.  You know, like stitch them up, sew them up.  Oh, yeah?  You got to cut the bottoms off the pants, stitch them up.  And look, no hot dog fingers.  How's that, eh?  I haven't got the hot dog fingers. 
[01:01:30]  Vienna sausage.  Yeah, Vienna on my foot.  You don't see a Vienna's ear.  Oh, Vienna fingers here.  He's getting a little defensive.  What toes?  A little man is getting a little defensive now.  Lewis has given up.  He has just given up.  I think I just saw Lewis shoot heroin right into his own retina.  Just to even out here.  I see the end of sugar.  All right.  It is right here on the opening.  Bob, what's up? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, this guy, Scott, he's dissing our community.  You know that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  He's dissing your community.  Who are you?  He's about to be called one of the lost boys.  How's that?  Oh, boy.  You know, who's screening the calls out there?  Oh, man.  Scott, the stars.  That sucks.  I think you're right.  That's a indication for midgets.  That's cool.  I'm going to yell up for that.  What do I sign?  One of the lost boys.  I don't know.  One of the lost boys. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, Jim, what do you have today?  I got a question for Mr. Black.  Try to engage him in a little conversation.  Oh, good.  Finally.  Wake him up, maybe.  We've moved to a stroke mode.  He's twitching in the corner.  This is your show for a year and a half.  Love every day of it.  Thanks.  Lewis, what do you think about Giuliani and the prostate cancer?  Well, I think that's what happens when you have Hillary Clinton up your ass.  For six months.  He's going to damp his ass for a long time.  And that's what happens. 
[01:03:00]  And what do you think about the fact that they go, oh, you know, this really makes him human.  And then the next day they're going, he's got a girlfriend, he's got a girlfriend.  How nuts is that?  They allowed him to have the prostate thing for about 30 seconds.  Oh, yeah, you've got prostate cancer.  Move on, you pig.  What's going on over that?  He's screwing that woman.  Woo-hoo, boy, let's get him.  I say the chick's a prescription.  Because I think you have to use your prostate to keep it in working order. 
[01:03:30]  You ever see an old pump on, you know, you go to the village restorations and the pump  is working nicely?  It's because it's been lubricated and worked.  You go to some old ghost town and try to work that pump.  Well, rusting water is going to come out.  You lose it.  Right.  How many villages have you been to, Resinny?  It's what I do, Lewis.  I travel from ghost town to ghost town working on pumps.  That's what I do.  You found me out.  I'm the pump guy. 
[01:04:00]  Doing research for the show.  Hey, Lewis, if you think that Hillary gets in, what do you think is going to happen in New York?  I think nothing.  We will still go.  We will function no matter what jackass they put in front of us.  We've proven that.  Anybody can arrive and we go, yeah, right, shut up and move on.  We just keep doing it.  I just think the worst thing is that means he's, you know, dopey's going to be around too.  Clinton, he's going to be wandering the streets looking for work and annoying me to no end.  I'm going to see Crystal down a flashback. 
[01:04:30]  It's going to be great.  It's in the neighborhood.  It's great.  I saw Clinton and Hillary, I saw all of them speak recently.  And I've never actually been in a room watching the four of them.  It was Clinton, Hillary, Gore the schmucko, and Tipper the horse.  And I've never seen any, I've never experienced anything.  Hillary Clinton is, it's like somebody is communicating through her mouth. 
[01:05:00]  She is, it's not her, it's a radio show.  It's like literally, they've got, the voice is coming from somewhere else.  She is not, I, who have no attachment to my feelings at all on a lot of levels,  I'm more attached than this woman.  This woman is emotionally, I think she's totally, what is she thinking?  She's going, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you know that she's, it's like she's saying stuff, but she's not there.  She's not there.  And then Clinton, she isn't, though.  It's true.  It's really true. 
[01:05:30]  It's like, it's scary, though.  It scared me.  She doesn't have a human emotion in her body.  And nobody says anything.  I know.  I'm like, listen to you.  Yes, it takes a village.  But who said it?  Who said it?  You didn't say it.  It's coming from another planet.  And Clinton, I had no concept.  Women were so wet, they could not move from their seats.  Yeah, they love the power, I guess.  They love him.  It's appalling.  I, who was a pig for part of my life, couldn't get the kind of appreciation, this jackass guy. 
[01:06:00]  And it's like, and he talks, and you're going, he's a used car salesman from Arkansas.  And that's become a sex symbol?  It's like, kind of, the Italians were a sex symbol.  Jews, they go through everything.  Oh, boy, I want to poke him.  I want to poke him a used car salesman from Arkansas.  Because, you know, it's like, and it doesn't matter.  He's like, oh, he's passionate.  He's passionate about anything.  If he would sell anything, give me the Miata, I'll sell that. 
[01:06:30]  Give me the Fiesta, I'll sell that.  He doesn't care.  Civil rights, sure, I'll sell it.  He doesn't give as long as he's got something to sell.  It's nothing coming out of him, though, eh?  Oh, man.  But it's directly coming out of him.  And it's all sperm.  It's 24 hours a day.  He's pumping it.  I've never seen women act like that.  And there are women who are like Brian.  It's like, no, shut up, Lewis.  Get out of the way, Jackie.  What do you think of the video the White House made?  Well, you know, where do you get the time? 
[01:07:00]  I'm in this business.  I don't have the time.  We're all in this business.  When was the last time the three of us made a video?  We don't have time to make a video.  Where did you get the time?  It was actually funny.  It was really funny.  It really irritated me.  Yeah, I know.  You didn't want to laugh, you know.  But he's good.  That's what he's good at.  Yeah.  You know, because he's good at selling, you know, BS.  And then I saw Gore.  And the thing about Gore was that I went to get online to kind of shake his hand.  Yes.  I thought, I'll never get this.  You know, he was still around. 
[01:07:30]  I thought, I'll get to shake the hand of a guy who might be the president.  That never happened.  We had 50 people online.  And then I thought, ah, nah.  I'm not going to wait on this line.  And I'm walking away.  And I'm thinking, I would wait longer to get on a log ride in an amusement park than I would to shake this guy's hand.  That's the charisma, yes.  Yeah, you don't even want to wait.  I didn't want to wait.  Could have been a historical moment in your life.  Yeah.  Nah.  Screw it.  I'm going to punch you.  Screw it.  Yeah, you wake him up. 
[01:08:00]  What a round of publicity that would be, huh?  Yeah.  Comedian Louis Black punches Vice President Al Gore.  We've got to get Crystal out of here, I'm being told.  Uh-oh.  She has a 6 o'clock show, right?  Yeah.  6 o'clock show.  Well, get your clothes back on and get the hell out of here.  Can I stay?  Yes, Scott, you can stay.  Any final thoughts for Crystal and her huge boobs?  See you in flash dances.  Get that funny money ready.  I'm coming down.  Funny money.  Get that cash ready.  I'm sorry, Sonny. 
[01:08:30]  You can't come in.  You ever get that at the door?  Yeah.  That's why you got the mustache, though.  Yeah, that's right.  What I like when you buy them a drink, the drink comes out for like $95.  Do you see that?  Oh, you'd like to buy them a drink?  Sure.  How do you get the pill?  $95.  $95.  Give me a beer and that's it.  I'll take the Dom Perignon in the heavy water to get down some of the, uh, well, that stuff  goes for about a billion dollars a gallon.  Well, Crystal, well, what's funny?  Which one do you want to hit?  All right, we want to thank Crystal Storm for stopping by. 
[01:09:00]  She's got a lot of shows at Flash Dancers tonight and tomorrow night, 52nd Street and  Broadway, of course.  Thank you, Crystal.  Thank you.  Say a little more gamma.  Okay.  All right.  And, uh, we got to take a break.  We'll be back with Louis Black and Scott, the little person.  There you go.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Uh, Anthony.  Yes.  Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff. 
[01:09:30]  Opie, you should be, uh, sending him a thank you note every day of your life.  Dr. Philotoff did the, uh, laser vision correction on Opie's eyes.  Opie was wearing glasses since he was in third grade.  I see Louis is wearing the glasses over there.  I'm wearing the glasses.  Yeah, you've got to do something.  A little paranoid about the procedure, Louis?  No, I'm waiting for a dog.  I'm waiting for a dog, yeah.  And then have the dog get the procedure.  Exactly.  It's great.  You know, I want the dog.  You're the best guide dog around.  I'm afraid.  I'm paranoid about it.  I, I...  Opie was.  I, I was very paranoid. 
[01:10:00]  He was freaking out.  I did research for a year, Louis, and it was a piece of cake.  You should get it done.  I'm serious.  We have some audio of Opie, uh, right before the procedure.  There he is.  See?  See?  No, Opie.  It's okay.  No, Dr. Philotoff will take care of you.  He'll talk to you.  No, no, no.  It's okay.  He talks to you.  He does the procedure.  It's only like 20 minutes, and everything's taken care of.  Okay.  See?  There you go.  You stopped crying.  I stopped crying.  You know, driving?  I, I, I, I have 2015 vision, and I drive at night, which is amazing. 
[01:10:30]  That I heard this.  But I've always, that's the thing you always hear, that you get that blurriness.  Uh, I did not have it.  No.  That's great.  No, I did not have that at all.  Unbelievable.  He can see.  Dr. Philotoff is like Jesus Christ, giving people eyesight.  He's got a new procedure for leprosy.  He's curing lepers now.  It's amazing.  Huh?  Nothing for dwarfs.  Nothing for dwarfs yet, uh, Scott.  Sorry, Scott.  Sorry, Scott.  You're going to laser correct your kneecaps or something.  I don't know what the hell they would do.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  I suffered this much.  It suffered.  Has it been a drag?  Eh, a lot of times.  Yeah.  It depends.  Like, prom night was a drag.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, bro, who's not a drag?  Yeah.  It's a drag for every, every guy.  No, he means he was in drag.  They know me all year.  They talk to me.  How you doing, Scott?  From prom night come, nobody knows who I am.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's a sad story.  Yeah, but that's the same thing for half of America.  They all know me every day.  Scott, what do you do?  What do you mean?  Scott, let me let you in on something.  No one gets laid prom night. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  So you didn't miss anything.  And the people who do peak at that age and the rest of their lives are going to lose  a damn day.  Those are the people who go, oh, that was it.  That's great.  And then the rest of their life, it's never as good.  Where'd you get the tuxedo, man?  That must have been a tough one.  That's from Jerry Mahoney.  That's friggin' funny, right?  Jerry Mahoney.  Her face didn't fit me, so I went to Jerry Mahoney.  Jerry Mahoney.  That's pretty good.  That is a heck of a reference. 
[01:12:00]  That's reference of the day.  So Diamond Vision and Dr. Phil Toff, he's running another drawing, Anthony.  Yes.  All you have to do is call 1-800-984-2020, 1-800-984-2020.  They'll put your name in a drawing for a free procedure.  If you put your name in the past drawings, you'll be all set for this one as well.  Okay.  It's for a Valentine's Day special, which might not be that good a deal.  No.  What if you get it done, now you can see what your Valentine looks like, and you don't  want her to be a Valentine anymore?  Or vice versa?  There you go.  And also, he's running a spring special. 
[01:12:30]  You can get the procedure for just $2,500.  That's nothing.  That's not per eye.  No, it used to be per eye.  Spring special, $2,500.  If you call Diamond Vision right now, 1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020.  All right, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yes.  Mother's Day.  But first, a lot of people want to know who Jerry Mahoney is.  Remember Winchell Mahoney?  Remember that?  Knucklehead.  Knucklehead Smith?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:13:00]  He was a dummy.  Paul Winchell.  Yeah, he had a TV show for a couple of years.  Yeah.  Didn't do the numbers that Regis' show did, but, you know, it was great for kids.  And it was a healthy show.  And then it became this, which dummy would survive when the show went off?  Survival of the fittest dummy.  I think he was trying to recreate the whole Howdy Doody atmosphere, and it just wasn't  panning out at that point.  And then fly?  No, something.  You know, Howdy Doody, the whole innocence of America.  It's sort of, you weren't going to watch another show that was kind of like Howdy Doody when 
[01:13:30]  body bags were being sent back from Venom.  You know?  Sort of changed our outlook on things, I think.  Yeah.  We finally realized the dummy wasn't talking.  It wasn't real.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  The dummy's dressed like a VC.  There's people interrogating it and shooting him in the head in the streets.  Running down the street on fire from napalm naked.  A little dummy.  It was terrible.  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company. 
[01:14:00]  Now, this is a wonderful thing.  It's a good segment.  Mother's Day coming up.  What are you going to do?  The flower root?  Hey, Scott, you can get clothes for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  I'm telling you.  Leave me that number.  Definitely, man.  Leave me that number.  It might have some extra, you know, bow ties and stuff.  I'm telling you.  A little hat.  A little hat.  That's a month of my wedding with Crystal.  You can wear that tux.  We got a couple of Vermont Teddy Bears laying around the place.  Let's see if you fit in the clothes.  Fit in the clothes.  You are awful, Opie.  I'm sorry, Scott.  I'm cool.  All right.  Well, Mother's Day is coming up. 
[01:14:30]  A week from Sunday.  You want to know she's loved and appreciated.  It's not until next we could.  Oh, man.  I was really in the crisper there for a moment.  Better get another week.  All right.  Your mom, your wife, or grandma's wife.  Your mom or a grandmother will receive a beautiful bear  handcrafted in Vermont and personalized for her  with a carton candy delivered in a colorful gift box.  You can get the angel mom bear or the mama's boy bear 
[01:15:00]  with a heart-shaped mom tattoo.  Bears are all tailored to your mom's occupation.  You can do that.  Talk to the bear counselor, 1-800-829-BEAR.  They'll hook you up with a bear that best suits who you want to give it to,  your mom or your girlfriend.  A dwarf.  A dwarf.  No, they don't have that bear, Rick.  They don't like when we talk about bears that we don't have,  such as the cruel and inhuman bear  and the bitch-took-all-my-money bear.  They don't have those. 
[01:15:30]  They don't have them, so don't call for them.  I think that nurse bear.  Yeah, they have the nurse bear, the teacher bear, the gardening bear.  Hug a bear, hug a dwarf.  The pregnancy bear and the new red-hot mama bear.  That's a frightening concept.  Call your bear counselor right now, 1-800-829-BEAR.  That red-hot mama bear might look good to me right now in a long road.  I apologize for the big one for my teddy bear.  No, you didn't mean it in that way.  It could be Scott's prom date. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, hey.  No, I'm going to ask Crystal first.  All right.  But, yeah, Anthony was saying, call 1-800-829-BEAR before he gave up.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR or shop online at vermontteddybear.com,  the creative alternative to flowers for Mother's Day.  It's a great gift.  Nurses Week and graduation right around the corner as well.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  I've had it.  1-800-829-BEAR.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you, okay?  It's the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  What is Nurses Week? 
[01:16:30]  I don't know.  Everyone's getting a week, a day, a month, or something.  I could use a Nurses Week.  Nurses Week.  They're just creating.  That's great.  I work with nurses, and they're not doing nothing special.  Nurses Week, celebrating with Enema Thursday?  Yeah, what's the week consist of?  Monday we go with the tongue depressor, Wednesday's bedpan day.  They're just creating holidays now.  Everybody's dentures in a bowl, trying to find who's who's.  And we all finish up with a morphine drip Saturday. 
[01:17:00]  Bobbing for stool samples in the bedpans.  I'm glad you said it.  Hey, Scott, did you drive here today?  Yes, sir.  Ah, now how's that?  Yeah, how do you do that?  Yeah, I got pedal extensions that go over the regular pedals that people drive.  Two long pipes, and that's it.  Imagine some poor sap tries to carjack them.  Get out the car.  Get out the mother-effing car.  Pulls him out, and he's like, knees are up to his ears.  Trying to work the pedals.  I came all the way from Short Hills.  Is that a joke?  Yeah, I drive. 
[01:17:30]  Snip that one right by you.  I live in Short Hills.  Grinch.  Well, we're still in the middle of commercials, believe it or not.  What's next?  We've got to play Midget Town for Scott.  You like Midget Town, Scott?  Where's the next commercial?  I can't wait.  What is that?  You haven't heard Midget Town yet?  No.  All right, check this out.  This is the story of six strangers picked to live together in a house and have their lives take.  Find out what happens when they stop being polite and start getting tiny.  Real-world Midget Town. 
[01:18:00]  Listen, Binky, I don't like it when you talk down to me.  You belittle me.  You make me feel two feet tall.  Well, I have some news for you, Chi Chi.  You are two feet tall!  Me, she used to work in a circus.  And he's all like, oh, I used to ride on a pony.  And I used to drive a wind-up Volkswagen.  And I'm like, Midget, get over yourself.  I think the problem here is that they're all a little jealous of me because I come from the entertainment industry.  I was in the circus.  I don't know if I mentioned that to you.  And also for a number of years, I played Snuggles the Fabric Softener Bear. 
[01:18:30]  What you need to understand is that going to Six Flags Great Adventure is a waste.  We're dwarves.  We can't get on any of the freaking rides.  Well, that's where you're wrong, Chi Chi, because we can do a lot.  It's a great adventure.  We can get on that thing that looks like a worm that goes in a circle.  It's like a worm wearing a hat.  It's like a green plastic thing.  But it goes in a circle.  It goes up and down a little bit.  We can get on that.  We can get on the boats.  Little boats.  You know those boats?  They go in a circle around in a little water there. 
[01:19:00]  And they have bells on the front of them.  They have bells.  And if you pull on the string, you can ring the bell.  So, shut up.  Hey, what are you guys doing?  We were just going to go out and throw rocks at people, you know, for staring at us.  That sounds good.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  By the way, I'm gay.  That really caught me off guard.  I didn't know he was gay.  I thought I was gay.  I wasn't sure.  When he said, I'm gay, I'm like, put that together with being a midget.  I got enough on my plate here.  That was tonight on Real World Midget Town. 
[01:19:30]  That's good stuff.  That's good stuff.  Yeah.  That's funny stuff.  You sure?  Yeah.  We've got to thank Steve Morrison for that bit.  It's a very, very funny thing there, man.  That is funny.  I'm gay and I've got enough on my plate.  Snuggles.  Snuggles.  Lewis has to leave soon.  I've got to go soon for me.  Oh, really?  He must depart.  Do you want to leave now?  Shortly.  Shortly?  Why do you have to say that?  Oh, wow.  Is he making you leave?  Shortly. 
[01:20:00]  Shortly.  It is unbelievable.  You can't say soon?  In a few minutes?  No.  You know, I spent the whole day waiting to say shortly.  Oh, jeez.  In a minute?  In a minute?  All right.  He's got to go in a little while.  A little while.  Soon.  Soon.  In a few minutes.  In a while.  I mean, what, uh...  Yeah, you can't say that.  I'm saying it now. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Let's finish up this break.  We only have a few more commercials to get through, and we'll be back with Lewis Black.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change  the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it's seriously easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Anthony.  Anthony.  We've just received a PhD in stupidity.  1027.  WNEW.  Moving right along.  Lewis Black in the studio, playing Carolines all weekend long. 
[01:21:00]  Call Carolines for ticket info.  A couple shows tonight, 8 o'clock and 1030.  Tomorrow, same thing.  Lewis, another surreal moment.  Pass the little guy's resume around.  And we've got Scott, the little person in the studio, who we have found out has a few  chops to him, Anthony.  Yeah, pretty funny.  Very funny guy.  I also know Otto and George.  I know George.  Do you know the guy?  I know those guys.  He knows the puppet. 
[01:21:30]  You know the puppet?  I used to chill with the puppets.  We used to go double dating.  He's very funny.  Otto, why would we get drunk and try to stick his hand up your butt?  Oh, damn.  I thought you were George.  I'm sorry, man.  Those guys are funny, man.  Oh, man.  You're going to be by my house.  You know where the comedy brokerage is?  How long have I was?  In Dumbo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brokerage comedy, sure.  All right.  I think we have to get Lewis out of here.  I've got to get George? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I've got a May 9th at my special.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's next week?  Next Tuesday.  Next Tuesday.  10 o'clock.  Looking forward to that.  Mr. Plug here.  You know how good I like you.  You know how much I like to plug.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's just plugging all the time.  I really like it.  I came out here and tell you, do this.  Watch me here.  You see here.  Do you see here.  We leave that for Jay Moore.  Let him come out and plug it.  Lewis just doesn't like plugging.  Oh, I don't like it.  You've got to twist his arm. 
[01:22:30]  It's all right.  I'll plug for you.  Well, thank you.  Very funny guy.  I finally got to see you.  Like I said, it was a dreary winter night, but I still laughed my ass off.  Suck night at the stress.  You were so miserable, but you had everyone laughing.  And then they went on to kill themselves.  My favorite was, I heard that thing this morning where the Frank Gifford thing where he's talking  about how he would, I felt like I should drive off the road.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  It was in 2020.  Oh, was it Kathy Lee?  Yeah, you know, I felt like, you know, this wasn't working.  I should drive off the road and I should just take my little Mercedes into the abutment.  And I thought, you should have.  You should have given the choice between going back to the third rung of hell and the abutment.  I would rather see what was on the other side.  You know, you've got to wonder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Sandy goes, you want me to tape that for you last night?  I'm like, I didn't even watch it.  Didn't even want to.  Why?  I didn't want to get pissed off at the TV. 
[01:23:30]  Well, maybe to get some research for the show or something.  Yeah, but you're good.  But some, you know, it gets to the point with the research.  I try to watch stuff for research and you just think, you know, I'd rather put a knitting  needle in my craft.  Right.  You know, and that'll be an experiment, too.  I'll research with that.  You know, rather than research what kind of pain it causes.  Watching this stuff.  You know, Kathy's just got to face the fact that Frank wanted some butt love.  Yeah, really.  That was the whole, I think that was probably the biggest issue, her being such a Christian  woman.  And Frank wanted the back door off of that girl that he was with in the hotel. 
[01:24:00]  Wanted some butt love.  He wanted to ram into that abutment.  He's got some life.  He ran into defense's lineman.  He was a football player.  Yeah.  Now he's running into that other lady.  Oh, Kathy Lee?  No, Frank.  He played for the Giants.  Yeah.  He ran into lineman.  Now he's running into...  Let me set this up.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  We're going to need this.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Frank. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  He ran into lineman when he was playing with the New York Giants.  Now he's running into that lady, Johnson.  What was her name?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Okay.  One of the tips.  Okay.  One of the tips is, even when in doubt, you can't pause.  Okay?  You had to...  I apologize to all our listeners.  Lewis Black is usually much funnier than... 
[01:25:00]  I was.  I usually am.  I bet that once you brought in those giant ta-tas, there's only so much my brain can handle.  Is she happy with her life?  I don't know, Doc, isn't it?  All right.  We've got to get Lewis.  I'll see you guys soon.  All right, Lewis.  Thanks for coming in again.  Lewis Black.  Go check him out at Caroline's.  Yes, a bunch of shows tonight.  Take care.  High five.  And what's that?  May night?  May night is your special. 
[01:25:30]  That's a low blow.  Good seeing you.  Bye, Lewis.  You see Ben Stein in the hallways of Comedy Central.  Smack him in the head for me, would you?  I'll be talking to the Jewish community.  Very good.  All right.  There he goes.  Lewis Black.  And why don't we take a break?  Okay.  And maybe we could do a little bit of Spaz's Week in Review as we end the week here.  Oh, wow.  We were supposed to do that two and a half hours ago.  Spaz's news and views.  Yes.  Of what's going on.  Why don't we end the show with that?  We've got 40, 45 minutes. 
[01:26:00]  We could probably get through Spaz's Week in Review, okay?  Great.  And, Scott, do you want to stick around for that?  Yeah.  It's always a pleasure.  You could abuse Spaz.  That's always fun.  It's Friday night.  What do I got to do?  Fun for people of all sizes.  All right.  We could all get together and make fun of Spaz.  Spaz's Week in Review is next.  Hey, Anthony, the weekend upon us.

[01:28:30]  We're moving along with the program.  We're going to try to get back to Spaz's Week in Review.  We started it about two and a half hours ago, but we got sidetracked with Crystal Storm and Louis Black.  And, of course, our new favorite person here, Scott, the little person. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  A lot of people saying you're very funny, Scott.  Cool.  Billy's on line 12, Anthony.  Yeah?  Billy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Greetings from Asbury Park.  Woo!  It's beautiful down there, Anthony.  You're sitting down here with a tall neck.  Oh, yeah?  Hey, listen.  If anybody's not going to go see Louis or go see Scott, I'll be at Colorado on the shore all weekend.  Call more plugs.  Yeah, why not?  I'm trying, huh?  I hear you.  I hear you.  I'm over here now. 
[01:29:30]  No, I'm over here now.  You're going to be at Caroline's.  You said Caroline's?  Oh, Rascal's.  Sorry.  Oh, Rascal's.  I'm listening to Louis, for God's sake.  Oh, Rascal's on the shore?  Yeah, Rascal's on the shore down here in Ocean Township.  Show's 8, 10, 30 tonight and tomorrow and Sunday.  All right.  I'll be short ribs on Sunday night.  And now ribs to kids 12 and under.  Dude, you're pretty good.  You should think about it.  You really should get on stage, Scott.  You got some chops there.  I'm telling you that much, man.  You could easily get 10, 15 minutes together, can't you? 
[01:30:00]  I think so.  All right.  Start with a good five and you go from there.  There you go.  All right, Bill.  Hey, listen.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Have a great weekend.  You too.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Look at this guy.  Hand it out balloons.  Doing a painting, though.  What is he doing, man?  He's making a painting.  What is it?  A paint enema?  Yeah, it looks like some guy's got a blue paint enema, and then he's naked squatting over  a big white canvas.  I think let's loose, and that's his art. 
[01:30:30]  Leroy Neiman is proud.  That's great.  All right, Spaz, sit down.  Let's get some Week in Review out of the way before we get out of here.  And Scott's going to make fun of you.  I'm going to rip you, man.  Try to arrest me.  Spaz, what do you think of Scott, the little person to your left there?  He's very little.  Let me see you harass me.  He's tiny.  Tiny.  He would kick your ass.  Punching me in the kneecaps.  All right, that's it.  Get him white, P.D. on the phone.  There he goes. 
[01:31:00]  Back another night in the slam.  The pride of Sloatsburg.  All right, and let's get right into Spaz's Week in Review, okay?  Yeah.  We'll try to get through the first story here.  This is K-Dawg with the K-Dawg Week in Review.  Let's just go right into it.  Just so you know, there's no sports or entertainment breaks.  So let's get right all news with K-Dawg.  Okay.  A wife and a husband go to church.  The husband looks at another girl.  So what does the wife do after being Catholic and holier-than-thou? 
[01:31:30]  She decides to try to run him over with a car.  Now, I know that if I look at another woman, then all I get is just like a little, you know,  like don't do that again and take a slap in the arm.  But this woman went psycho, and she tried to run him over with a car.  After two attempts, she didn't get him, but then hit him with the third attempt.  And they're only 22 years old.  Let me tell you something.  If they're not, are they married? 
[01:32:00]  No, no, they're not married.  No, no, they are married at such a young age.  Stupid.  Young and stupid married.  Never marry when you're young.  It's stupid.  Because it just never works out.  You get cases like these, like War of the Roses.  Anyway, the guy jumped out of the way both times, but the third time stood in the middle of the street with his arms crossed.  Then the woman hit him.  Listen, if a person is trying to hit you with a car, don't stand in the middle of the street.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  That's a blessing for you.  He went flying, and I was in a hospital.  And the wife is being charged with a attempted murder. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  All right.  I'm surprised you didn't comment a little more on that story.  Did you see what type of church it was?  No.  It was a Southern Baptist church somewhere in, I believe it was Alabama or something.  Then there had to be African American.  Oh, I don't know.  I was just saying, maybe you would have commented.  Why are you dissing the brothers?  Why are you dissing the brothers and you dissing them?  Usually a Southern Baptist church in Alabama means it's the African American church. 
[01:33:00]  Okay, so now do you have any more things you might want to add to that story, knowing those facts?  Um, all I'm saying is that the story doesn't really surprise me.  All right, Spaz, so you think that every person that gets hit by a car is just too stupid to get out of the way?  Well, this guy, he stands in the middle of the road with his arms crossed.  If the woman tried to hit him twice, you don't think she's going to go for a third time with him standing?  I'm more fascinated at his take on what happens to him when he looks at another girl. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  So what happens?  You're walking down the street with the lovely Erica.  You look at another girl.  What happens?  Honestly.  Honestly?  Well, it's like, well, it is disrespectful to her.  So what are you doing for?  I just do it out of habit.  Habit?  Habit.  Can't you tick your nose, scratch your balls?  What are you going to do that for?  I still do that.  So your luck and your punishment is moving to Sloatsburg. 
[01:34:00]  No, that's not the punishment.  Sloatsburg?  I went there once.  It was closed.  What up, Bob?  Spaz, he's a beautiful town.  He's got better chops to do.  I mean, they're the RFD.  Yeah.  You're good.  All right, let's move on with Spaz's Week in Review.  Yeah.  Not much to that story, I must say.  Let's move on.  A judge is trying to tamper with a jury.  We've got an African-American judge who is trying to make sure that the jury is full of African-Americans 
[01:34:30]  as well as Hispanics and other people of, uh, shaded color.  What?  What?  Other people of what?  Shaded color.  Shaded color?  Yeah.  Where did you get that?  From Crayola?  Where'd you get that from?  Water doodles.  Other people of a shaded color.  The grease man.  Well, it goes back to last week when I said that I can't tell between Puerto Ricans and Cubans and everything,  so they must be of different shades. 
[01:35:00]  Neither could I, yeah.  Well, the Cubans, eh, smell a little worse than the Ricans, eh.  Water doodle.  Bone dry, snarling, eh.  When I was slinging lead with the Washington Police Department, eh,  I used to come across a lot of spades, eh, as they're called.  People of colored shades, eh.  The inner spares have a lot in common.  They're both racist, eh.  Bonehead, bonehead, eh, snarling, eh. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  We'll be back with more of the Beastman Show after we make some racially insensitive remarks.  Different shades of color.  Different shades.  Nice.  So, he's manipulating the jury system to make sure that another African American who is on trial gets a good trial by his peers.  I guess it's because the trial is in a white neighborhood.  Okay.  Okay.  Let me just tell you something.  No matter what manipulation you do to the judicial system, there's never swift and it's hardly ever just. 
[01:36:00]  The black man will always get put down.  No matter what.  No matter what this black judge is trying to do, which you'll probably get fired over.  I think it's a very noble cause on this part.  But then you're going to have other people just, you know, come down to them.  I, I, I, seriously, I think that he should not manipulate the system.  I think that, um, he should not tamper to put more African Americans and Hispanics and other shades of color on the, uh, jury system.  I think that he should be picked justly. 
[01:36:30]  And, um, I'm sure that these, these white lawyers will take very justly, putting, uh, very influential people, very smart people in the jury system that will judge this, this court case in a, uh, in civilized manner, in a, uh, just manner.  So, anyway, this guy is risking his job.  I, uh, I just think that, uh, he shouldn't be doing this because it just tampers with our already failed judicial system.  Okay.  Perfect.  Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate. 
[01:37:00]  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  All right.  I have.  Oh, my God.  I have no clue what you were trying to say there.  Absolutely none.  Scott, Scott, do you have any idea what he was trying to say there?  Guys, when we leave today, you got to walk out first.  Yeah.  With a midget and you ain't walking out together.  He said, I think he meant that no matter what, uh, happens,  the black man will always be put down. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  And it's a bad thing?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  The Reverend Al Spaz.  No, I'm just saying that it's, he shouldn't be tampering with the system because no matter  what, the black man's going to go to jail.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, what's up?  And, and why is that?  Because that's just how the judicial system works.  Oh, man.  A lot of black people would agree with him, I guess.  I know.  That's the, the Bronx right now, everyone in the Bronx are cheering.  But I don't know what his motives are here. 
[01:38:00]  Spaz, Spaz, their new leader.  No.  I'm just saying that they probably deserve to go to jail most of them.  Oh, okay.  Now we're back to Spaz.  Okay, listen, you are probably the most despicable man I've run across as far as being racially  insensitive.  I'm not racial.  And, and before you burry.  At least you didn't say anything about the Jews.  Although, I don't like the way you say judicial system.  Let's, let's move on before he buries himself. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, man.  Too late.  Speaking of, I'm losing air time.  Black people tampering with the, with the lives of white people.  Let's go to Zimbabwe, shall we?  Uh-oh.  Zimbabwe, right?  The country in Africa.  Thank you.  Is a, is telling all the white people that they should leave.  Uh, said he wants to seize half the country's white-owned farmland and told whites they are  free to leave.  Okay, let me just say this.  Okay.  It is not, you are not in a position to tell white people that we're, holy, what are you 
[01:39:00]  going to say here?  You know something?  You have turned the week in review into the KKK message of the week.  Message, yeah.  You are left to your own devices because, uh, nobody got a chance to screen through your,  uh, little week in review that you do every week.  Left to your own devices, it turns into a platform for hatred.  I don't hate anybody, though.  Oh, my God.  It's just my, my thoughts.  All right, hold on to your, uh...  And he can't even see what he... 
[01:39:30]  Hold on to your hats.  Oh, come on.  So the white, so, so that they have no right telling the white people what to do?  They're not in a position to.  Oh.  This is the guy that was in Zimbabwe?  They're not in a position to?  No.  Why is that, Scott?  Because the Dutch moved in there.  So now we, they only, who are white, and they, they are now...  There's not many white people in Zimbabwe.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  Oh, my.  How much Windex did you drink today? 
[01:40:00]  We're getting there.  We're free to leave.  Okay?  We're free to do whatever else we want.  We don't need you to tell us that we're free to leave.  You may be black, and blacks rule Africa, except for South Africa, where the Dutch are, and  other people.  But I'm just saying, you should not...  It's just racism all over again.  And you're promoting it in Africa.  I can't imagine why he got arrested.  I can't imagine why this man got arrested. 
[01:40:30]  Spaz.  So, blacks are in charge of everything in Africa.  Except for South Africa.  Well, who runs that?  The Dutch and the nether people.  Since when?  Since when their boats came in.  It's...  Well, how do you think that...  And what happened?  What happened?  The boats came in in the 1800s.  Wait a minute.  The Dutch invaded South Africa.  How do you think Nelson Mandela got to jail because the white people put him there?  Yeah, but don't you know he's been out for a while? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, I know.  And do you know who's in charge down there now?  Another black guy?  Spaz, why don't you finish his eye wash bottle?  Yeah, really.  Drink up.  Drink up.  L'chaim.  Are you almost done with the farmers in Zimbabwe?  Yeah, he's done.  Which is where all you people came from in the first place.  So, it is not your place to stay and we will stay there as long as we choose.  Please, Spaz, we go.  And flying off to the southeast. 
[01:41:30]  What is he doing now?  Yeah, he...  You know what's so good about your week in reviews, Spaz?  Yeah.  The way you present it, I get the picture that we're flying around the globe.  All of a sudden, we're in Zimbabwe.  The next stop, we're flying where?  Southeast.  Southeast.  Southeast.  To where?  Vietnam.  Today's movie, Short Eyes.  What are you going to say about...  You'll find out.  Southeast of Zimbabwe?  No, no, no.  We fly to the southeast. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, I thought we were leaving Zimbabwe and flying southeast.  Spaz, did you move two and a half hours away from the city to get away from black people?  Ah.  No, but there's hardly any in that town.  In Sloatsburg?  There's maybe like one or two.  Well, hopefully you could get rid of them, right, Spaz?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, I don't have a hatred.  I love everybody.  Spaz kind of explained to us at dinner why he's like this, by the way.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that story. 
[01:42:30]  Is that the one with the guys in the train?  Yes.  It was about when I was, you know...  When he was mugged.  Yes.  In school?  Yes.  You want to tell that story?  Maybe this will help you a little.  I doubt it, but...  Well, 1995 was my very last day of high school, and it was an attempted mugging on me.  I never gave him a dime out of my wallet or my gold watch, and he slashed me two times  in the back, still had the scars, 20 stitches per slash.  And it was a black guy who told me, by the way, saying, you've got to pay dues to walk 
[01:43:00]  in my neighborhood.  I don't pay dues to any black man to walk in his neighborhood.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  Oh, man.  Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  So that's what happened?  That's what happened.  And this, I think, has affected you.  Affected the way you look at people. 
[01:43:30]  I'm scared to take the subway.  All right, let's go to Southeast Asia.  All right, now we're going to the Southeast.  Flying off to the Southeast.  It is the 25 years after the Vietnam defeat.  And that happened about almost a week ago.  Who won?  Who was the winning pitcher that night?  Defeats.  Who won?  Who won?  I'm not the same.  Any home runs that night?  Here's Chris Russo where you need him.  All right, Mikey.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Some day at Vietnam, we suffered a pretty good defeat.  I don't know.  We started out pretty good early in the innings.  In the later innings, we got taken out by Charlie.  The Viet Cong hitting us pretty hard.  Like a ball game.  It is the 25 years after the Vietnam defeat.  And that happened about almost a week ago.  Some people were visiting, including Mr. McCain, who is a POW,  and sometimes goes berserk, remembering the war days. 
[01:44:30]  Anyway, it's 25 years after we...  What do you mean he sometimes goes berserk?  Anthony makes believe he goes berserk.  He's never gone berserk.  No, I just heard because when you're in wartime and then later on after wartime,  you remember the thing.  So when you hear a loud bang, you hit the deck.  Not every guy that was in Vietnam has that happen to them.  I was in Vietnam.  It's called a flashback.  I was a bullet. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  Defeated the yellow man, the slanted eyes,  the ones who could be blindfolded with dental floss, the gooks.  Now, what happened in the train with a Vietnamese person?  Did they kick you in the shins or something?  Where does your hatred for Asian people come from?  I just find them annoying.  You find them annoying.  Spaz, if we're ever going to do another weekend review with you...  Call me.  You've got to do one of these without being a racist idiot. 
[01:45:30]  I will.  You sound like an idiot now.  I'm not racist.  I'm not short.  We defeated them 25...  Well, they defeated our ass 25 years ago.  We should have just bombed every one of them.  We should have just...  Instead of dropping...  You know, we dropped two on Japan.  We should have dropped, like, ten on these people.  Just destroyed the whole country.  You know, the amount of things that they did to American soldiers,  they shouldn't deserve to live.  They're just...  I think they're more racist than Americans. 
[01:46:00]  You know, the way they act towards us and the way they did in the past war.  We were trying to help them out, you know, settle peace and be a democracy,  set up a communism state, and how do they repair us?  So, I think we should just bomb the whole country.  Vietnam should not be existing, but a pile of rubble right now.  Spaz is wearing a short shirt.  Spaz.  Shorts.  He's laid to hell.  Spaz.  If we would have nuked Vietnam, what would have been the repercussions? 
[01:46:30]  Nothing, because there would have been a pile of rubble.  Wrong.  Who was backing North Vietnam during that war?  North Vietnam.  Who was backing them?  The Soviet Union.  Very good.  Is that your final answer?  Is that your final answer?  Would you say things were a little touchy between the Soviet Union and the United States in the 60s?  Like, touchy to the point of we all thought maybe we were going to die in a big nuclear cataclysm. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  So, if we nuked North Vietnam, don't you think that might have put a little pressure on the Soviet Union to nuke us?  But we didn't nuke them.  We were nuking North Vietnam.  Nuke.  What would have happened if Russia nuked England, which was an ally and still is of the United States?  Would we not turn around and nuke Russia?  Probably.  Yes. 
[01:47:30]  Your politics are effing hysterical.  They're effing ponderous.  Do you think at all?  Do you put any thought into what you're saying?  When did you do this last night in jail?  When you dropped the sub?  When were you doing all this?  The ramblings of a man with a plunger in his behind.  Speaking of McCain.  All right.  Speaking of McCain.  Who spoke of him? 
[01:48:00]  Speaking of McCain.  Who's a PNN POW?  He was trying to make it nice with Reverend Al.  Is this going to be another racist thing?  My God.  Oh, my God.  The whole report is racist today.  I'm not racist, though.  McCain is a racist.  And I'm told.  That's the old gag.  McCain is a racist.  And before he's said that Ted Al Sharpton, he's an intolerant man.  But now all of a sudden he's been in peace with him.  He's trying to help out Rudy G's campaign. 
[01:48:30]  I think.  Rudy G.  He's like a friend of his.  Rudy G.  Like a buddy's.  Oh, my God.  Rudy G.  But I'm not racist.  That's like saying as you lay there with a guy's junk in your face, another one knocking at your back door going,  But I'm not gay.  See?  I'm not gay, so it's okay.  Junk all over you.  I'm not gay.  Rudy G.  I think that he. 
[01:49:00]  Politicians.  See, this is the way.  It goes back to my first making review.  Politicians play dirty politics.  They'll do anything.  They'll change their minds, and nobody will catch this except for the few smart people like myself.  Nobody will catch this because the media portrays it in a certain way to just grab the reader or the listener or the viewer.  And these politicians just change their minds to suit their own needs, to suit their needs of getting elected, as well as put money in their pockets. 
[01:49:30]  See, they need the African-American vote.  They need the black people.  They need the black people to get voting as senator.  In the state.  And so Rudy G. is pulling out those stops.  He's pulling out the cancer thing.  Oh, man.  He's pulling out the cane.  He's pulling out the black people.  He's pulling it out of them.  Wait a minute.  Rudy's pulling out the cancer thing.  There's surgery for Rudy.  He's pulling it out right now.  Yeah, much like some right now.  Oh, it's like a way that he's going to get sympathy.  So he just came up with having prostate cancer. 
[01:50:00]  He's playing the sympathy card, so he can't get attacked by Hillary anymore.  Hey, Bobby Bonilla just walked out.  So, so, ah, yeah.  Black girl does look like Bobby Bonilla.  Yeah.  Spaz, so you don't think he has cancer?  All right.  Well, magically, he was able to will himself to get cancer so he could get Hillary off his ass?  No, he has cancer, but he's exploiting the disease to suit his own needs.  Oh, Spaz.  What did he tell me? 
[01:50:30]  He just told people he had it.  What did he, a lie about it?  I'm only kidding.  Why wouldn't he tell people until after the election?  Why does he have to tell them before the election?  Because he's playing dirty politics.  It's on Broca, line six.  It's just, you know, Sharpton is an idiot.  But I think he should, but still, he should see through this.  And that's it with that.  That was your line four.  All right, listen.  Spaz.  What else is on this week in review? 
[01:51:00]  Retards, chinks, homos.  Yeah.  I got in late today.  I wasn't able to screen this mess you're calling the week in review.  What else is on here?  I totally forgot.  I was sick when I did this.  I'm very passionate about it.  Oh, I forgot.  The cop car was a very bumpy ride.  I can only write so much.  All right, we'll try one more story.  Yeah.  Okay, moving right along.  There's another African-American just trying to...  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with this African-American? 
[01:51:30]  I got to hear the story.  You don't remember what you said?  No.  No, they're all alike.  All the stories.  It's not like baby Huey.  Do you want to hear this, Ant?  I really don't know what it is.  I don't know.  Let's let it roll.  There's another African-American just trying to bleed the hearts of New Yorkers,  much like Reverend Al does a lot.  And this guy was a subway push victim.  He got pushed in front of a subway.  And now he can't walk.  So now he's trying...  You're making fun of the guy that got...  Oh, my God. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I will step over this console and beat the living crap out of you.  I'm not making fun of him.  What the hell are you going to say about that guy?  That's all...  I'm just saying that he didn't lose any money.  I was about to say that he's not losing...  He didn't lose any money.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll go to this.  Dude, so now he's trying to get all these donations.  He's not trying to do anything.  He said he didn't have enough for his new house, so he's pleading for more donations. 
[01:52:30]  He needs a new house.  He doesn't have a leg to stand on.  But he was saving the money before he got pushed.  The guy is now shorter than Scott.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, but he didn't lose any money.  He's insurance.  He lost his legs.  He lost his legs.  His insurance pays for that.  The insurance doesn't pay for everything.  He's got one leg now.  But his insurance...  He didn't lose that much money.  This guy gets pushed in front of the subway, loses both legs.  He's an African-American, which, I don't know what that has to do with the damn story.  How did he tie in the two stories together? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, great.  Nice tie-in.  Nice tie-in.  And you're pissed off at this guy because he's asking for money?  It's because he had enough save up for the house before he got pushed.  What did he use the money for?  Oh, my God.  What did he use the money for?  What is it?  What do you think he used the money for?  He's insurance pays for the medical bills.  Financial advisor.  Spaz.  Doesn't he?  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Spaz, he's now handicapped. 
[01:53:30]  He can't just get a walk-up at this point.  Okay, I understand taking donations, but now he's got enough for the house.  Now he wants more?  To get, what, appliances for the house?  Yeah, take your throat first.  Oh, I'm going to hear what he says on this day.  Yeah.  I mean, he can't get me hit by a car.  If he has it, or by a train, he has insurance.  They take care of that.  So he loses no money out of his pocket.  Now we have to lose money out of our pocket to give it to him.  He lost his legs.  And they said, well, I needed a goal to get my dream house. 
[01:54:00]  So they reached that goal.  Now they're saying, oh, no, well, we need more now, you know.  We underestimated how much we needed.  Well, go screw yourself.  I mean, you've got enough money from us.  How can you do that?  He's got no legs.  He can't screw himself.  Oh, my God.  Spaz.  He got enough money from us, and now he's begging for more.  He's not.  And first of all, it's a charity.  It was in the paper.  It's not coming out of your pocket.  They've been having fundraisers and stuff. 
[01:54:30]  So if you feel, you know.  It was in the paper.  More important than this.  We missed something earlier.  Spaz, who are the nether people?  They come from the Netherlands.  The nether people.  I don't know what they're called.  Are you kidding me?  The nether lands.  The people from the nether lands.  The nether people.  They're from the nether lands.  And people were calling earlier and giving FUs out to you and I because we didn't have  sympathy when he almost got arrested yesterday.  But I can understand giving him donations, but come on, he's begging for it now when you're 
[01:55:00]  giving him a ton of money already?  How much did you give him?  I didn't send him anything.  Okay.  So what's his we?  And have you been watching him on TV and stuff?  He's not begging at all.  In the paper, he was.  He was not.  In the paper, it said so.  The Daily News.  Watching comic book?  What paper?  The Daily News said it last week.  Another People Gazette.  You don't even have sympathy for a guy that loses two legs.  I have sympathy for some wacko who pushed him in front of a subway.  I have sympathy for that, but there's one thing. 
[01:55:30]  What do you think he's going through with his family?  If the African American didn't push him.  No, you're not getting the point.  I can understand giving him donations, but when you go out there, once you've got a ton  of donations and then beg for more, I think that's a little off the wall.  That's not what's going on.  In the paper, it said I'm asking for more money because the money has not been met for  the money I need for the house.  So what's in his bank account?  John Rocker checking in, and I was suspended?  Yeah, exactly.  He failed breeding comprehension in school.  He had to. 
[01:56:00]  Psycho Mark first.  Even Psycho Mark's getting pissed.  Psycho Mania.  And Psycho Mark's probably the biggest racist I've ever seen.  Psycho Mark's getting paid for, though.  What do you think insurance?  Everyone just has insurance, and you just get everything for free?  Psycho Mark's money.  Psycho Mark's money.  He had money for the house before he got pushed, and then we give him donations.  I understand that.  Bleeding hearts.  But then to beg for more?  You don't beg.  Stop begging for more.  You don't beg.  Psycho Mark's money.  This from a man who stood on the street yesterday and let people yell at him for five bucks.  All right?  Until he got arrested for racial remarks that he was yelling at a crowd of innocent bystanders. 
[01:56:30]  It was not all racial remarks.  Aunt Jemima?  Aunt Jemima.  That was the only one.  I thought, I love the pancakes.  I want to hear the rest of this.  Not enough money from us.  What do you need?  You didn't lose anything except for your legs.  Your insurance pays you right.  Okay?  So stop believing the pockets of New Yorkers.  Okay.  I could be that monkey I could always be now.  I got the hands.  I got the...  Do we even try the next story? 
[01:57:00]  You haven't had one story that wasn't racist.  I'm not racist.  All right.  Now we move on to teachers.  Teachers are being accused of helping kids cheat.  Are you going to mention black kids now?  You are, aren't you?  No.  I left them out of this.  Ah, good.  An exam.  They're not smart enough to go to school.  Well, they're saying that they're rotten apples. 
[01:57:30]  And it said, despite a crackdown on cheating, some city school teachers are still helping  students cheat on high-stakes standardized tests.  So basically, Americans are already dumber than Japanese people.  Let's put it that way.  As much as I hate, you know, the slanted-eyed people.  Oh, man.  There it is.  I thought he was going to go against the blacks on that one, but no, the Asians again. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, my God.  You guys can stay here if you want.  I'm going home.  Spaz is weak in racism.  I'm going home.  I'm not racist.  You got paraplegicists pissed off at you.  Vietnam vets pissed at you.  KKK dog.  Black people pissed at you.  Wolfs are probably pissed at you.  Nukes spaz.  You misinterpret me.  Misinterpret?  Dude, this thing, your bit's over.  You're done.  You're done.  It's misinterpreted.  I'm just commenting on news stories. 
[01:58:30]  I'm done.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Spaz.  That's only half his week in review.  Spaz is weak in racism.  I'm not racist.  What else is on this tape?  Quite honestly, I do not remember.  I don't remember.  All right.  Well, later.  Thanks, Spaz.  I don't want to hear anymore.  So we're up there. 
[01:59:00]  I want to thank Scott, the little person, for stopping in.  It was a pleasure.  Look, Spaz is all upset now that Opie yelled at him.  Opie, who he's been trying to get closer to.  Spaz, I don't want to.  He's calling him at home, and all of a sudden now he's all freaked out that Opie is dejecting him.  I don't want to be close to you.  I'm going to get shot, too.  You're not racist.  I'm not racist.  Dude, it's not even funny.  It's just stupid.  That's stupid.  That's like a duck walking up to you and going, I'm not a duck. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  No, it's a duck.  No matter what the duck says, he's a duck.  Right.  I'm not a dwarf.  No matter what the dwarf says, he's a dwarf.  Yeah, maybe try that.  Try that.  Spaz.  Spaz, am I a dwarf?  Look at him.  Or a duck?  What is he?  A dwarf?  Now say you're not.  I'm not a dwarf.  I'm a little person.  I'm a duck.  See?  Do you get it?  It doesn't matter what he tells you.  I'm a human being.  You know that he is, in fact, a dwarf.  Right.  I'm misinterpreted. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Misinterpreted?  Misinterpreted.  I've been misinterpreted by the blacks and the slanty eyes.  You are unbelievable.  All right.  We're out of here.  Oh, man.  What happened?  Earl just took the paddle to Spaz's ass.  We got a race riot going on in the studio.  Wow, this is real stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is real stuff.  This happens all the time.  This stuff happens all the time.  They got to fight.  Bobby Bo, get the back. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, man.  They got to fight.  Spaz and black girl.  I got my money on Bobby Bo.  Earl's shaking, though, man.  Earl, don't be...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Earl just lifted Spaz up in the air.  They're back down on all fours.  All right, Earl's down.  Spaz has the top position.  This is better than midget wrestling.  Earl's down, though, but he's putting up a fight.  No, Earl's doing very well.  Come on, Earl.  Spaz trying to reach over.  Come on, Earl.  A lot of people out there counting on you.  Oh.  Take that. 
[02:01:00]  Okay, the flip over.  I got to switch mics.  Spaz trying to pin Earl, but Earl broke out of it.  They're in some weird 69 position over here.  Yeah, it does look like a 69 now.  Spaz's legs are, like, all flopping around.  Oh, Spaz is giving Earl karate chops.  What the hell is he doing?  All right.  All right, now Spaz has Earl in a headlock.  He's got his legs around him.  It looks like an Oreo cookie.  Look at that.  I'm not racist. 
[02:01:30]  Look at the look in Spaz's face.  Spaz has him in some wacky ECW-type hold.  What is that, Spaz?  Leg lock.  A leg lock.  It's a leg lock.  It's a figure four leg lock.  God damn.  Do I give?  All right, I think that's a...  All right.  Oh, he stepped up.  Help him up.  We end the week with a little race riot, a little fight club.  Earl finally had it.  I don't blame him.  Yeah.  You go, Earl.  All right, Anthony, really fast before you leave. 
[02:02:00]  If you're in the Jersey area, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey area,  right now as we speak, a bunch of people from the Radio Chicks show is down there.  They're celebrating Cinco de Mayo, and they're at a bar called On the Border,  which is on Route 1 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I guess they're having a huge Cinco de Mayo party.  Yeah.  You don't have to enter the party to get your WOW stickers.  I guess they're handing them through the fence, because I guess this place is huge,  and a bunch of people wondering if they have to go in to get the stickers.  No, you don't. 
[02:02:30]  They're right there near the fence giving out the WOW stickers, okay?  Yep.  And with that, you guys have yourself...  Can I give one shout-out real fast?  Yeah, go ahead, Scott.  My nephew's Anthony Michael Christopher, and my daughter Amanda, I love you.  Go to bed.  I'll be home soon.  All right, very good.  And with that, we've finished another wonderful week of radio, Anthony.  Absolutely.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday at 2.  When do you learn on the job?  I like that I'm a functioning idiot without a high school diploma to get a job on the radio.  That's O.B. and Anthony.  Theater of the Mindless.
