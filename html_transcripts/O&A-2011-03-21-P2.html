<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show, hosted by Sam Roberts, opened with a discussion surrounding the sixth anniversary of Terri Schiavo's death.  The segment featured audio of Schiavo's father emotionally, and at times profanely, attempting to communicate with her, alongside her own seemingly responsive, though unintelligible, vocalizations.  The hosts and crew debated the authenticity of the audio and the ethical considerations surrounding the Schiavo case.

Following this, the show moved on to recounting Opie and Anthony's appearance at an Imus event at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Audio from the event included an interview with Rob Bartlett, who humorously described his relationship with Imus as a mutually abusive one.  Post-event audio featuring Opie and Anthony's own reactions and observations on the event and audience response was played.  This segment also included an anecdote about crew member Eric Nagel's exaggerated claims of a close relationship with Sean Hannity.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a comedic deconstruction of the movie *Twister*.  The hosts and callers dissected the film, mocking its plot, acting, and dialogue, pointing out perceived inaccuracies, particularly regarding locations.  Numerous audio clips from the movie were played to highlight the over-the-top nature of the acting and dialogue.

The show then shifted gears to celebrate Eddie Money's birthday.  This segment featured a previously recorded studio session where D-Boy, a crew member and avowed Eddie Money fan, sang "Two Tickets to Paradise" with Eddie Money himself.  D-Boy's performance and interactions with Eddie Money were discussed.  The birthday segment briefly touched upon the upcoming Ron and Fez show, its competition with Jim Norton's show on the Boneyard, and the hosts' experiences at a Donkey Kong competition.  Ron Bennington, the future host of the Ron and Fez show, briefly joined the conversation near the end.  The segment also mentioned a planned appearance by a tornado hunter, who ultimately did not appear on the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Of course, Opie and Anthony have officially left the building.  They're gone.  They were gone 30 seconds after the show ended.  But the rest of us are still here.  We're talking a little bit, not necessarily just about what happened today. 
[00:00:30]  A lot happened today.  But also talking about what's happened this year.  A few anniversaries.  A few birthdays to celebrate today.  And apparently, there's going to be a tornado hunter in the building today.  And he may stumble into After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm here, Sam Roberts, of course.  We're just cleaning up the studio.  Danny, Travis, E-Rock, Troy, D-Boy.  The Ron and Fez interns are about to come in to switch the studio over. 
[00:01:00]  Today was a big ONA show because for the first time, we got into it.  I mean, a lot of people have been blowing up my Twitter, I know.  And I'm sure Opie, Anthony, and Jim's Twitter are asking that we mention Rebecca Black.  And finally, finally, Rebecca Black came up on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Exciting news.  We have the instrumental track for the Rebecca Black song, Friday, that's taken over the Internet. 
[00:01:30]  So we will begin the recording process with Club Soda Kenny tomorrow, whether he wants to or not.  But on Friday, speaking of Friday, of course, on Friday, somehow the fates aligned.  And Opie and Anthony, for the first time in definitely months, possibly years, went all the way to 11.  And that forbid us from celebrating a very important anniversary.  It was an important anniversary for the show, but it wasn't the show itself. 
[00:02:00]  Friday was the six-year anniversary of Terri Schiavo.  And, E-Rock, it was the six-year anniversary of her death?  Yeah, of when she passed away.  You all remember Terri Schiavo.  She was, you know, in a vegetative state for so long.  She was all over the news.  And, of course, Opie and Anthony used that as fodder for their show.  It's what we do on O&A. 
[00:02:30]  It's our job.  It might not have been the most tasteful thing, but it's something that's gone down in Opie and Anthony history for sure.  So without further ado, this is Opie and Anthony's opinions on what was going on at the time with Terri Schiavo going all the way back to 2005.  Yes, kids, there was a 2005.  And this is what happened.  It's Terri Schiavo on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After O&A Live.  It's audio of Terri Schiavo's father speaking to her in bed. 
[00:03:00]  And you hear a little voice off in the distance, but the one that's really distinct is Terri's.  And it's just a lot of...  But is she answering?  Yeah, is she?  And is this legit?  Is this legit audio?  Yeah.  So this is audio of the father talking to her in her hospital bed.  And does she answer?  It certainly sounds like she's answering.  I mean, they don't really sound random.  That's creepy.  She's there starving to death right now.  Yeah, I don't like this whole thing, man.  This is ugly.  It's a little weird.  I don't like her fucking...  I think her ex-husband is...  Her husband is just thinking of other motives. 
[00:03:30]  I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's not just, oh, she wanted it that way.  This seems like, ah, she's kind of still kicking.  And a lot of his money is going to take care of her.  Potentially his money.  It's probably her money.  But since they're...  I don't know.  Imagine, imagine if you will, that Terry Schiavo...  Imagine if you will.  Terry Schiavo.  Terry Schiavo.  Schiavo, excuse me.  Terry Schiavo is actually completely there.  Wow.  But cannot communicate.  And they're all looking at her.  And she can see what's going on in the hospital room.  That is a Twilight Zone episode.  It's like, dude, do not take that feeding tube out. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God.  I am coming back.  I just know.  I'm alive.  I'm in here.  Will someone hear me?  I'm in here.  I'm in here.  Oh, that's horrible.  The serpent in the rainbow.  So Haitian just blew something into her face 15 years ago.  Dr. Allen.  Terry Schiavo's father.  Talking to Terry.  Hi, Terry.  It's 3.55.  It's 3.55 on Friday.  How are you, sweetie pie? 
[00:04:30]  Hi.  You got a smile for your daddy?  You got a smile for me?  Yeah?  You gonna give me a smile?  You gonna give me a smile for your daddy?  Huh?  Huh?  You gonna say something for me?  Hi, dear.  I didn't even touch you.  How you doing? 
[00:05:00]  How you doing?  How are you?  Huh?  How are you?  Are you okay?  Are you all right?  No.  You had best to un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck. 
[00:05:30]  Can you say hello to me?  Can you say hello to me?  Well, no shit.  Can you say hi, dad?  Can you say hi?  Are you a little maggot?  You make me want to call it.  Can you say hi?  I'll choke yourself.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there. 
[00:06:00]  I said joke yourself.  Is something hurting you?  Did your parents have any children that live?  Sir, yes, sir.  I bet they regret that.  Bullshit, it looks to me like the best part of you ran down to cracking your mama's ass and niggas up at the ground, staying on the mountain.  No.  What?  Huh?  You were just so well.  Oh. 
[00:06:30]  Does anything hurt?  Oh.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  You have no right to take me.  Shut up!  Will you shut up!  Shut up!  Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up!  Are you feeling okay?  Huh?  Shut up!  Oh.  Huh?  Does something hurt you?  Huh?  Huh?  Does your head hurt?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  You're so ugly you can be a modern art masterpiece. 
[00:07:00]  Does anything hurt you?  No, Patty.  Your days of finger-banging...  Does your oil hurt?  Does your nose hurt?  Does your mouth hurt?  Does your back hurt?  I want to ask you a bunch of questions. 
[00:07:30]  I want to have them answered immediately.  Does your leg hurt?  Stop whining! Stop whining! Stop it!  Does your ears hurt?  Stop whining!  It's not a tumor!  Now we're having fun.  All right, listen.  All right, listen.  All right, listen.  I want to eat your pussy if you want me to fuck you. 
[00:08:00]  If you want me to stick my fingers in your ass, just go.  Old creaky door voice.  If you want me to fuck you, sound like a Kawasaki jet ski.  I think they should yank the tube, not because she's not there,  just because she's irritating.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Can't understand a fucking thing she says.  Well.  Wow.  The dude from Jersey says,  Now if you play it backwards, she's saying,  Kill me, you ass.  Wow. 
[00:08:30]  Well, there you have it.  I think she is definitely communicating on some level.  You think?  Dude.  Yeah, he's asking her questions.  That could just be what is a human body hooked up to no playlist.  Just kind of, you know, making sounds.  She made the yummy noise.  She made the yummy noise.  Yeah.  He's going to be singing putting on the rich soon.  What hurts your mouth?  What hurts your ear?  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal. 
[00:09:00]  Put it on the rich.  Put it on the rich.  Someone's got to take the Pat O'Brien sex tapes and that audio and come up with a little ditty for us.  No.  Why not?  Wow, that is really awful.  Just tell Terry you're into her.  Just pretend that you're into Terry.  What an annoying father.  Oh, the same.  Oh, what hurts?  Your mouth?  Your ear?  Your back?  What hurts?  What the fuck do you think hurts? 
[00:09:30]  He's probably pinching and twisting each one.  Does your nose hurt?  What hurts?  Honk, honk.  We should listen a little longer.  Do your nipples hurt?  How about your clit?  Does this hurt?  All right.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Stop.  Quiet.  After O&A.  Live.  After Opie and Anthony live.  That was Terry Schiavo dating all the way back to 2005.  That was already six years ago that the whole Terry Schiavo thing went down.  I wish that the mics were just let down all the time. 
[00:10:00]  Because while that bit was playing, Roland was in here on Anthony's microphone doing Anthony impressions.  And, Iraq, what happened to the last guy?  What happened to the last guy who did Anthony impressions on Anthony's mic?  That was...  I forgot his real name, but they called him the champ.  Bobby.  Bobby the champ.  Yeah.  That was a very entertaining segment for the very next day.  Maybe we'll play that tomorrow when we have a little more time for that.  But, yeah, I mean, I don't know what Roland's thinking. 
[00:10:30]  Then again, he is psychotic.  They're setting up for Ron and Fez.  That's coming up.  By the way, announced at the end of today's show, Jim Norton's show on the Boneyard, his heavy metal music show.  That sounded like somebody who doesn't know what he's talking about, heavy metal music show.  Norton's show on the Boneyard is now airing at 10 p.m. starting today.  So, 10 p.m. Eastern Time on the Boneyard, you'll be able to hear Norton's show.  Norton was back today, and he mentioned that he was disappointed that he didn't get to go with ONA to the Imus event that they went to at the end of last week. 
[00:11:00]  Imus had a thing at the Hard Rock.  It wasn't broadcast, but there were still a select few members of the press allowed there.  And by a select few, I mean one.  And by one, I mean me and my recorder.  We were at the Imus thing.  Roland was there with E-Rock.  A bunch of us went down to support ONA and get a couple audio clips.  We talked to Rob Bartlett.  Now, this audio was outside. 
[00:11:30]  It was at the Hard Rock in the main room while the ONA interview was going on.  So, there's stuff going on in the background.  But that just helps showcase the party atmosphere that was Kiss Me I'm Imus at the Hard Rock Cafe last week.  Here's Rob Bartlett talking about ONA.  Jesus.  Wrong button.  Here's Rob Bartlett.  What are you laughing at, E-Rock?  It's nice to see you screw up for once.  Yeah.  Here's Rob Bartlett talking about ONA.  What do you want?  I just have a Coke. 
[00:12:00]  A what?  Coke.  Coke.  So, you're getting out of here, Rob Bartlett.  Just as Opie and Anthony are going on stage.  How did it go for you?  It went pretty well.  I went in there.  I had a game plan.  I wanted to not suck.  I didn't think I sucked.  I think I did the job.  I set the stage.  I created the hole for them to go through.  You know, they're running for daylight.  I think it's going to be a hot show.  I think there's going to be a high scoring game.  And there are many labs that can hear them.  If you're really doing well now, they just started.  They're off to a good start.  I think that coming to the end of the night, I think it's going to be pretty clear who the 
[00:12:30]  winners are here.  You're a big Broadway star now.  Is it different being on this stage now that you're so experienced on the Broadway stage?  Are you doing plays?  Yeah.  The difference here is that there aren't any hot dancing girls.  Not a lot of hot dancing girls.  It's Imus.  There's a big difference between a hot dancing girl and Imus.  About 90, 95 folds of skin, basically.  I noticed before you went on that you and Imus have a certain back and forth where you  just sit there brutally insulting each other. 
[00:13:00]  Is this something that goes on every morning?  It's something that's been going on for the past 25 years.  Yes.  Sam, it's a beautiful thing.  We kind of love each other in that kind of Lyle, Menendez, father kind of way.  It's beautiful.  We have these warm, fuzzy moments where I just want to wrap my arms around him and take  a pillow and put it softly over his face and sit on it until he stops flopping around.  That's beautiful.  I appreciate you giving me the time this evening.  My pleasure, Sam.  I just want to say it's been a real pleasure talking to you. 
[00:13:30]  I enjoy your work.  I think this 10 o'clock thing is really kicking ass.  I think you've got a long career ahead of you.  Hopefully, you'll have a support system that you need to keep going.  If there's anything we can do, I'd be more than having to be there for you.  Thank you so much.  Rob Bartlett is psychotic, but he's also hilarious.  It was great to see backstage just him and Imus busting each other's balls.  Imus was just telling him how much he sucked.  He couldn't look at his BlackBerry without Imus criticizing him.  Roland, you were at the Kiss Me, I'm Imus show. 
[00:14:00]  Were you there when Bartlett was just getting his balls busted by Imus?  I was, and I didn't do it in Anthony's impression.  That was lies.  No, I wouldn't lie.  All I said was, the feature.  That's all I said.  And who was that an impression of?  It could be anybody, 1940s people.  In that future voice.  Yes.  And you did it on Anthony's mic.  Well, I walked by to tell you something, the thuds went, the feature.  Well.  Um.  Yes, he really, but he wasted everybody's balls.  Sean Hannity. 
[00:14:30]  He's hilarious, isn't he?  Imus?  Yeah.  Like, I mean, off the air, he's the same guy as he is on the air.  He says, Sean, you look fat because you're full of shit.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know if he went blah, blah, blah.  But we did.  And he says, Sam, you look like shit.  I don't know who you are.  I don't think he said that.  I'm sorry that he did not say that.  He said it to Eric, though.  He did say that.  He did say that.  Well, yeah, and Eric, we mentioned this on the air while you were on the shitter on Friday.  Uh, you always gave the impression that Sean Hannity knew who you were.  Yeah, I was under the impression that he knew who I was as well. 
[00:15:00]  And how embarrassing was it when we're all sitting in the dressing room and-  He looked at all three of us.  He looked at all three of us.  And Sean Hannity sits down because you, for years, have said, yo, yeah, I know Sean.  I'll hook up this interview.  I'll get him to call in.  No problem.  I'll email him.  Every time he's been on the show is because I talked to him.  Yeah, but then he sat down and he said, okay, which one of you writes me?  Yeah, I-  And then you said, that's me.  And then he pointed at you.  It all came crashing back that I realized I haven't been physically in front of him,  I think, for 2004. 
[00:15:30]  And then he said, stop writing me.  Call my people.  No, he pointed at you and he said, Eric Nagel, right?  He had no idea who you were.  Yeah, I kind of sat there and went, oh, great.  It was embarrassing.  Well, here is Opie and Anthony directly after they got off the stage at the Hard Rock.  But you laughed at Eric Sam.  Huh?  You laughed at him.  I absolutely laughed at him.  It's very funny.  It's his misfortune, which is funny for the rest of us.  This is ONA after they left the stage at the Hard Rock.  And if you listen closely at the end, you'll hear Mr. Imus. 
[00:16:00]  Well, now I can drink.  No way.  I got Hannity.  Oh, wait a minute.  Can't go on Hannity drunk.  So how did we do, guys?  How do we feel?  About what?  What happened?  I don't know what that was.  It was almost like in the actor's studio for radio.  Except not aired anywhere.  Except not aired.  It was a one-off.  Right.  It was a complete wasted time.  Because it wasn't on TV or radio.  Right.  If there's no TV or radio, why would you do anything?  The brilliance will never be captured.  I wasn't even recording it. 
[00:16:30]  No.  Oh, really?  No.  I'm sure somebody was.  Nothing was said that could end up on YouTube, though.  No.  Nothing was said that would end up anywhere.  It's the same story.  The audience was old as dirt.  And they hated us.  Yeah.  There were a couple people.  Ant's trying to, like, explain our St. Pat's...  Yeah.  Did you look at the audience when that was going on?  Yeah, they were horrified.  And Ant's trying to sell, like, no, I think I can turn you guys around.  I literally saw a woman put her hand over her mouth and gasp. 
[00:17:00]  She went like...  Oh!  You, like, excuse yourself by saying you act away in the church.  It was...  In the vestibule of said church.  As if that was going to make them...  Further away from the giant crucifix, the better.  Right.  The image of that.  You were losing Sean Hannity, your pal.  He was even shaking his head, going, oh, my God.  Well, I was trying to...  I don't want to hear this story.  I was trying to word it.  Well, Don asked the question.  I had an answer.  Right.  And I was wording it in a way where I said sexual encounter and that.  And then I had to throw the F-bomb in because, you know. 
[00:17:30]  Shock Jack's in the house.  I'm a shock jock.  Look out.  Shocking.  Winning.  Winning.  Like that.  Now, you're on your way to do Hannity now.  Yeah.  Opie, Hannity was trying to get you to do his show.  He actually said come over tonight, but I'm not dressed for it, Sam, so I'm going to  go home.  You could look fine without the jacket on.  Actually, that sounds like Vietnam era shit.  That's nice.  I would definitely fucking wear that.  Do you think Opie's ever going to end up on Hannity's TV show? 
[00:18:00]  Nope.  Opie?  I think I'm actually going to not do it, Sam.  Unless he wants to talk about what?  Um, like we would have went on and talked about Charlie Sheen.  Different things to call beer.  Or Gilbert Gottfried.  Different things to call road sodas.  Yeah, maybe talk about road sodas.  I have a feeling Sean Hannity didn't grow up getting road sodas.  No.  He was a goody two-shoes.  You think he was all the time?  His entire life.  He grew up on Long Island, so he would have gone through that Long Island phase in his 
[00:18:30]  teens, maybe, where he was drunk and driving and out with his friends.  You know, like me.  You're saying Sean Hannity must have gone through a phase where he was drunk and driving.  I did just say that, didn't I?  Yes.  Wow.  Okay.  You're a younger guy, man.  That was part of the culture on Long Island.  Drunk driving.  Yes!  Okay.  All the people listening to this are shaking their heads yes right now.  Yes!  That's what is unbelievable.  Just as some neighborhoods the kids would ride their bikes and hopscotch and perhaps  play Ringolivio, we would drunk drive. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, but as the old people are nodding their heads yes, Sean Hannity is screaming at the  radio, what are you saying?  Oh, no.  We don't think he ever...  No, he was too much of a goody two-shoes.  He doesn't understand.  You think he was?  No.  I see it as he grew up on Long Island.  Ask Mr. Imus.  I see it as he...  Has Sean Hannity ever had a wild side?  They were really asking.  Oh, Long Island.  They just said that they think that Sean Hannity, when he was a child, or not when  he was a child, when he was younger, he used to drink and drive.  Well, Long Island, you would drink and drive and just, you know, have fun. 
[00:19:30]  It's always guys like that are just real freaks, you know?  You think?  Oh, absolutely.  You think he had a wild side?  Oh, absolutely.  I think he does now.  You think he does, like, keeps it hidden, keeps it under wraps?  I think he's tied up interns on a weekend.  Yeah.  I think he wears panties when he's doing his show on Fox.  Did you try for the panties tonight, Anthony?  I'll give a look.  All right.  Good luck, Anthony.  Get out of here.  We're not supposed to do it right now today.  Yeah, really.  What are you doing?  That's after Opie and Anthony live.  Yeah, so the Imus thing was a great time, had by all. 
[00:20:00]  I wish it was broadcast, because it was a really good show.  But, nevertheless, apparently Sean Casey, who hunts tornadoes, is wandering around Sirius  right now, and he may end up stumbling in here, which is related because this show,  the Opie and Anthony show, that is, has a history with tornado hunters, more specifically  fictionalized ones.  Of course, the movie Twister.  We've had great times with a lot of movies.  Twister may be the favorite of a lot of you out there. 
[00:20:30]  I know it's a favorite of us around here.  So, here it is.  This is Opie and Anthony dissecting the movie Twister on after Opie and Anthony live.  After Opie live.  Could you please hear something?  I have to hear something.  It's so bad.  Yeah, could, someone's gotta start cutting up that movie, just here and there.  Just get us some clips.  Hopefully, before the end of the show, we'll see what's up on the old internet there.  They're just running around chasing tornadoes, man.  And you got the bad dudes, yeah, and the good dudes. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  How is it bad dudes?  They're like corporate-sponsored tornado chasers, and they have these black SUVs.  They're like NASCAR teams.  Yeah, yeah, like a NASCAR team.  They've got logos and corporate sponsors.  And they wind up not listening to the, you know, extreme cool team and wind up getting  themselves killed.  Thanks for blowing it.  Well, what are you gonna do?  Movie's been out forever.  The bad guy is the clouds.  No, no, no.  The bad guy is the bad guys. 
[00:21:30]  And they're ripping off the idea that the cool extreme dudes have of getting this little  contraption that opens up, and all these little sensors fly into the tornado, and you get  these better readings of the tornado.  And the way they have to place it is absolutely ridiculous.  Why does it have to be put in the middle of the street?  There's the, um, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who else?  Yeah, he's real bad in that. 
[00:22:00]  He is real bad as far as being an extreme dude.  And, uh, Bill Paxton's in it.  Yeah.  Hey, what the hell are we supposed to do now?  Why don't you put her in charge?  We're doomed, man.  Oh, here it is.  I got a copy.  I can run it over to your apartment today.  It's so bad.  It's hilarious to watch with a group of people.  Embarrassing, douchey bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Helen Hunt? 
[00:22:30]  You said Helen Hunt.  Helen Hunt and her huge forehead.  They got cows flying by the windshields and stuff, yeah.  Helen Hunt looks like Barry Katz.  I wish more people knew who he was.  He's, uh, Dane's manager, and he was my manager.  He's had that potentially surprised look on her face.  Like Elon Gold, she looks like stupid Helen Hunt.  Uh, let's say hi to Dave in New Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey, Dave.  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, and you're forgetting the best part of that movie.  The name of the contraption was Dorothy.  Dorothy. 
[00:23:00]  Dorothy, yeah.  Because of the Wizard of Oz.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  And it had a little picture of Dorothy on it.  Didn't they, didn't they all have like cool nicknames too?  I'm trying to remember some of the nicknames.  Oh, why wouldn't they?  I forgot their names.  One guy was named Rabbit.  Yeah.  Rabbit?  Yeah, yeah, man.  That's a match.  Yeah, Rabbit.  It's been pretty.  Why, why, why Rabbit?  I don't know.  Why?  Ugh.  I'm just getting chills.  I'm getting chills.  What else were their names, sir?  Rabbit?  And who else?  I don't know.  Phillip Seymour often was walking around with a hoodie on his head and not on his body 
[00:23:30]  the whole time.  And everything was just so extreme and exciting for him.  Oh, all right.  We had Preacher.  Thank you.  We had Preacher.  We had Belzer.  We had Rabbit.  Oh.  I think that's about it.  Douche.  Yeah, the executive producer.  Yeah.  That's just awful.  I want to find some lines from that.  Let's go to Ricky in Massachusetts.  Ricky.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Rick.  Didn't somebody else in 96 make an overreacting audio? 
[00:24:00]  Oh, boy.  Did you trip over your own ass on that one?  What happened?  You got caught in a twister.  Yeah.  He basically wanted to say, it was a good line, too.  It was a good line, too.  You think Twister was overacting.  What about bra bombing?  The finger of God was in his mouth.  He couldn't talk.  Dummy.  Hoffman was Dusty.  Okay.  Very good.  Ew.  Dusty.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman's nickname was Dusty. 
[00:24:30]  Preacher and Rabbit and Dusty.  They probably thought they were such cool names.  Yeah.  His name in the movie was Dustin, but they changed it to Dusty.  They should have, because it blows.  He won an Oscar after that, though.  Not for that role, obviously.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, but...  Let's see.  God, I hate pop-up ads that come up right in the middle of what you're trying to read.  There we go.  All right.  All right, sir.  Oh, God.  Rabbit talks to himself in the first person.  Yeah, trust me.  Rabbit is good. 
[00:25:00]  Rabbit is wise.  That's some of the dialogue?  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Who said that?  Rabbit.  Rabbit.  Said it about himself.  He couldn't have talked about himself in the third person.  A third person.  Excuse me.  He did.  He did.  Oh, yeah.  They were full of themselves.  I don't buy it.  It couldn't be that...  What you just said made me want to hit you for reading it.  It is amazing how great this movie is.  Oh.  Because it's so bad.  Sounds wonderful.  Let's say hi to Nick in Westport. 
[00:25:30]  Nick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  Another great, funny scene is, uh, there's a nice old lady who, uh, slaughters cows to feed  the guys and, uh, give them steak and eggs one morning.  And it's just, like, ridiculous how, uh, she just comes off as this real nice lady and  they're like, oh, so where do you get the steaks?  And she's like, well, you know, how bad we just take them and basically slaughter them.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dusty is the, uh, and Dusty is Philip Seymour Hoffman. 
[00:26:00]  Dusty has a line, and I swear, it's right here.  The extreme!  It's the extreme!  He actually says that.  What's...  And then he goes, ha ha!  It's the wonder of nature, baby!  We got Chris from Texas.  Another horrible twister quote.  I'm talking imminent ruage!  What's ruage?  Rue the day.  Oh, my God. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, it's, uh, he's gonna rue the day he came up against the extreme, baby.  Bill, I'm talking imminent ruage.  That's a line from Dusty.  I'd love to find out who wrote this movie.  Let's say hi to Scott in Louisiana, Scott.  Oh, and then, and then, uh, this is watching Joe and Bill approaching a tornado on a video camera.  And Dusty goes, they're in the bear cage!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Cause that's just extreme.  Oh. 
[00:27:00]  Why can't you just say they're coming up to the storm?  Oh, this is so bad.  Let's go to Scott.  Louisiana.  What's up?  Oh, hey, what's up?  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hi.  One of the big movie flubs was, they were supposed to be in Kansas or Oklahoma, and every time they were driving down the road, they had a big sign that said Texas, the Texas State logo and everything.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't notice that.  Now, another film flub.  Here's another dusty line.  The sucks zone!  It's the point, basically, when the twister sucks you up. 
[00:27:30]  Ha ha ha!  Oh.  Let's say hi to Spencer.  Spencer, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Uh, hi to everybody.  Yeah.  Um, I wanted to talk about how the cell phone use was, uh, able to go on when the middle of a twister was happening.  Yeah.  And the second thing is, how gay was it when, uh, he told us, uh, Bill Paxson told the story about how he went naked in front of a twister?  Wouldn't it just kill him?  Ha ha ha!  Why? 
[00:28:00]  Did he want to be, like, one with nature or something?  Probably.  Yeah, exactly.  He was trying to get, you know, in his vision quest or something.  Yeah.  All right.  Dusty sucks.  Uh, well, Bob has a question for Jim.  Uh, Bob in New Jersey.  Oh, favorite scene, yeah.  Hello, boys.  Thanks.  Hey, Bob.  I wanted to ask Jimmy, uh, do you think these storm chasers like twisters?  Uh, apparently they don't like these twisters.  They love them!  Ho ho!  Catchphrase.  Uh, Iraq, you got my favorite scene on there? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you do?  We got, uh, volume?  All right, hold on.  Love it.  This, uh, I, I don't know why I'm fascinated by the awfulness of this movie.  Do you like this scene?  I, I don't just like it.  Uh.  I love it!  Paxton, uh, Paxton's nickname was The Extreme.  Of course!  Why wouldn't it be?  And then they had, yes, uh, let's not forget they had a love triangle in the middle of  a tornado.  Thank you, Pat from Philly, for that.  Uh, we're ready? 
[00:29:00]  What?  What happened?  What, what, what happened?  I can't pot audio from you.  All right.  Why don't they allow that?  I don't understand.  What's the law?  Streaming from the internet is the law.  Oh, it's the law.  Okay.  Oh, stop it, it's not.  I don't want to go to jail.  Who said that?  Stupid laws.  All right, we'll have to deploy that after the break, I guess?  Yeah.  We have Vinnie Brand coming in, he'll comment.  Uh, he's been here a while.  Has he?  Yeah.  I don't like Vinnie having to wait.  We bring him in at nine.  We acknowledge he was here.  The owner of the stress factory.  We acknowledge he was here. 
[00:29:30]  I said it 15 minutes ago.  I go, Vinnie Brand's here.  I knew.  He's just sitting there.  Let me take down the fifth wall here.  I knew.  But I have to face Vinnie now, so I was going to say, oh, dude, I didn't even know you were  here.  Of course you did.  Did they really play Riding the Storm Out by REO?  Oh.  When they're chasing their first tornado?  Yeah, they would play like storm songs real loud.  It was the music, man.  And there'd be speakers on the outside of the van.  Why? 
[00:30:00]  Because it's so extreme and they're so cool that they need like music playing.  You want the storm to hear it?  Yeah, here it is.  Yeah, strap in, man.  Crank it up.  We're cool dudes.  You bring your REO.  And they're just so excited and they're calling out like where the tornado is.  Stupid REO.  Waiting for the thaw.  Yeah.  Nothing says tough guy like REO Speedwagon.  Come on.  Justy, Bill.  You listening to me there?  This is so extreme.  Crank it up.  This is so extreme. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, we're listening to REO Speedwagon.  I'm streaming that.  Woo.  I wish to figure a gun would go down my throat so I could vomit.  Yeah, riding the storm out.  We're doing extreme.  Extreme.  Extreme.  Extreme.  Extreme.  I wish to figure a gun would go down my throat so I could vomit.  Not missing a fight.  Yeah, riding the storm out.  We're doing extreme.  Extreme.  Extreme.  Extreme.  Riding the storm out.  Oh.  Yeah.  Riding the storm out.  They're the good guy storm chasers.  The bad guy storm chasers.  Just listening to the weather. 
[00:31:00]  Riding the storm out.  Riding the storm out.  A twister filled with T cells.  It's just awful.  Baby beside me.  Oh my God.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  After ONA.  Live.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And for some reason, when you take a movie like Twister, we did the same thing with Independence  Day, when you take these giant blockbuster films, you sit on them for five to ten years, 
[00:31:30]  and then you reflect, you realize what a disaster of a motion picture they really were.  And I mean, I can't believe that Philip Seymour Hoffman at this point, who's become like a great actor, was even in that movie.  Now, Iraq, what would you say is more humiliating?  Being in the movie Twister, or the time that you made us all believe that Sean Hannity knew who you were, and then he sat down and he had no, he'd never seen your face before.  No, he'd seen my face, but he didn't remember.  Where did you think he knew you from? 
[00:32:00]  I've seen him several times, but then I realized it's been several years since I last saw him.  Well, where did you see him?  At ABC, when ONA did the interviews before they came back to XM.  So you just went in and shook his hand and said hello?  No.  I talked to him for a while, and then actually some other point in 2005, I was over there and we saw him.  I'm having a tough time believing you that you did more than just say hi to him and exchange cards with his person.  Oh, whatever. 
[00:32:30]  No, tell me.  No, fuck you, dude.  Why?  Because.  He didn't know who you were.  No, I know that.  And I was like, oh, fuck.  And I realized, wow, I haven't seen this guy face to face in several years.  I've talked to him constantly through email on the phone and stuff, but I haven't been face to face with him, so that's why he didn't recognize me.  Rob Bartlett recognized me and he told me he likes the 10 o'clock hour.  That he did.  Yep.  Sean Hannity had no idea who you were, though.  Doesn't know the 10 o'clock hour either, so.  Sean Hannity doesn't?  Nope. 
[00:33:00]  Well, he's got a lot of stuff going on.  He's got kids.  He's got a radio studio in his house.  Oh.  I was trying to get a confirmation on your potential guest.  I'm not.  He's done.  Okay.  Nah.  Roland's waiting for him.  Well, Roland can sit there waiting doing Anthony impressions all the time.  It's a tornado hunter, for God's sake.  Well, look who's here early.  Ron Pennington.  I mean, has this Lent thing just driven you insane?  It's...  You don't start for 20 minutes.  No, I'm really starting to like the Krover show.  It's really a lot of...  So you're just gonna hang out there? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, you and A-Rock have become like my fourth show.  So you...  This is...  Hey, sorry about the other night.  What about it?  The...  Ah, you know.  You mean the...  The attempt.  What attempt?  The attempt to do a live broadcast.  We got a lot of...  When me and Dave on Saturday, we were at the Kong Off in Flemington.  Yeah.  We got a lot of positive feedback from listeners.  Well, why did they give me all the negative feedback?  I didn't even hear you guys.  Well, it was good.  The Room hated us.  Because apparently those guys take Donkey Kong seriously.  Who knew? 
[00:34:00]  But the fans enjoyed it, I thought.  Wow.  Okay.  Well then, I guess clusterfuck is a good thing.  What?  I don't know.  I don't hear anybody use...  I don't know why the kids talk.  I didn't hear anybody use that word.  E-Rock?  I didn't hear that either.  Thank God.  Well, Ron, I don't know if you knew this.  No, I didn't.  Well, I didn't even say what it was.  I'm just saying, I don't know.  Okay.  Today's Eddie Money's birthday.  Really?  You know that?  Yeah.  Now you do.  And one of our guys, Derek D-Boy? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  He's a huge Eddie Money fan.  Why wouldn't he be?  He's from Long Island, right?  No, Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Because I thought only people from Long Island liked Eddie Money.  Eddie Money.  Well, only people from Long Island and then also Derek.  Because Eddie Money is Long Island's Bon Jovi.  Yeah.  Where Billy Joel is their Bruce, Eddie Money...  Well, Derek has turned his back on both Bruce and Bon Jovi and just gone straight for  Eddie Money.  I don't understand him.  But Eddie Money, we had him in studio a while back. 
[00:35:00]  Hmm?  Why?  I don't know.  Well, because of Derek, I guess.  Because Derek had the opportunity to sing with his idol, Eddie Money.  Okay.  And so this is what we're going to play.  It's Eddie Money and D-Boy on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  You want to sing a song?  Sure.  I see you've got your guitars in the...  Now, can you guys do the Wait It So Long?  Wait It So Long.  It could.  Yeah, we'll all help out.  No, no.  Sure.  They'll know if I'm in there.  Make sure the guy in the gray suit doesn't come in here and sing that song.  Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  That's Lurch.  Tell him to keep the day job, will you please? 
[00:35:30]  When do we say Wait It So Long?  I'll jam in because I used to sing.  Oh, no.  Come on.  You'll get it.  You'll reminisce.  It'll take you back 20 years.  Of course.  Hold on.  I'm kidding.  Three rehabs ago.  Three rehabs ago.  Come on.  Anthony?  I think Derek should do it.  It's about time we've mentioned Derek to Eddie Money.  Derek's a big fan.  What do you think, Derek?  What do you think, Derek?  He's a big fan.  This will be a thrill.  You have no idea.  We're not even lying to you.  For Derek to sing with Eddie Money is going to freak him the fuck out. 
[00:36:00]  Derek is, without a doubt, one of your biggest fans.  For real.  Where is he here?  We're all fans of yours, but I would say Derek is the biggest.  I'm not kidding.  We're not fucking playing right now.  I tell you, you guys got a great radio show wishing nothing but success.  Watch this.  So we've been wishing for success.  Derek.  Here's Derek.  There it is.  Derek.  Eddie, Eddie, Derek.  I love it.  He comes in, he starts cursing.  It's a great place for me on the radio.  You can't say whatever the hell you want.  It's amazing.  Is it true Eddie Money is one of your favorites?  Oh, yeah.  I love Eddie Money.  Thank you so much.  I wish my wife was a fan.  What do you love about Eddie Money? 
[00:36:30]  No, he's just great.  I went to like the summer shows and stuff and seeing him rock out.  What's your favorite Eddie Money song?  I'd say shaking.  Tits.  Shut up.  You got to keep bringing it up.  A half a million dollars, OB.  He just lost a half a million.  Come on.  One lousy word.  What would you have changed it to and you would have been $500,000 richer?  Look, I was doing it.  Her boobies?  Her boobies were shaking?  The skin under her biceps were shaking?  Yeah.  That doesn't sound sexy.  How about her cum milkers?  How about them silver dollar nipples?  Her feeders? 
[00:37:00]  I can say shit like this.  Her feeders and udders.  I love to show her.  Oh, yeah.  Derek is, no joke, Eddie, your biggest fan.  Huh?  Why didn't he shave, for Christ's sake?  Yeah, he's a fan.  I saw it.  George or a cowboy.  Is any money in your top five?  No.  Top ten.  Thank you.  Top ten?  Yeah.  Hey, come on, let's go to work here.  Here we go.  Two tickets, Steve.  Well, Derek's gonna sing.  Steve Ronson, everybody, the musical director for the play.  You know, the car part, it's just, you know.  We need a guy to do the lead guitar.  I'm usually drunk when I do this.  No, no, no, no, no.  Eddie, what part do you want him to sing? 
[00:37:30]  Just the...  Here we go.  I've got a surprise now, especially for you.  It's something that both of us have always wanted to do.  Here we go.  You've waited so long.  You've waited so long.  You've waited so long.  You've waited so long. 
[00:38:00]  I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here.  Yankee Stadium ain't got no money.  I've got two tickets in my pocket, baby.  We're gonna disappear.  Cause you've waited so long.  You've waited so long.  You've waited so long.  You've waited so long. 
[00:38:30]  I've got two tickets to paradise.  Pack your bags will leave tonight.  Two tickets to paradise.  Two tickets to paradise.  There you go.  There you go.  Did I get the job or what?  Oh my God.  That's really good.  Did I have my phone?  There you go, Derek.  Does the club want to have my number or what?  I thought you sang with any money.  Yes.  Was that fucking cool?  No, Derek? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, man.  Totally.  I didn't expect that.  I sucked, though.  No, you were alright.  Derek was kind of bragging.  He's like, I'm good.  He'll like me if I can see you.  After ONA.  It's live.  It's After Open Anthony Live.  Sam Roberts.  Ron Bennington is already here.  First of all, thank you for that live thing.  That was un-fucking-believable.  Well, you know.  It's Derek, and we just got to hear Derek's dream come true.  Can we start and call Derek Derelic and just go with that gimmick?  Derelic is good.  It never really caught on, and I know they're going to do the second. 
[00:39:30]  They're bringing that back.  Uh-huh.  What was the name of that movie?  I have no clue.  Ben Stiller and the Derelic.  Oh, Zoolander.  Zoolander.  Thank you.  Zoolander.  Thank you, Brian, my intern.  I said it.  Still, he said it right after.  So, Roland, you're in here.  You said that you were going to try, because some Sean Casey, who's a tornado hunter, was  supposed to be walking around serious, and you said you were going to try to push him  in here.  But now he's- 
[00:40:00]  Well, there's a tornado happening right now in the tri-state area that he's chasing.  I don't believe that for a second.  Wow.  That's not true.  I don't think so.  You're telling me he's delayed by the rain?  Possibly.  The storm hunter is being delayed by the rain?  Yes.  Well, I then tell him I'm bumping him.  He's not bumping me.  Here's the thing.  Oh, you are?  Because you only have two minutes left on the air?  That's right.  Now he's bumped.  Yeah, but now we have two minutes to kill.  And we're not used to that.  Oh, shoot.  This was all supposed to be storm talk.  Yeah.  This is-  You tell him he's fucked in this business. 
[00:40:30]  He'll never do another crossover show.  I'll look into that.  Do you remember your old intern, Bobby the champ?  No, I don't.  Well, you used to make him walk around with a title belt.  You said he was the best.  That's why you called him the champ.  Fez.  No, I think it was a different guy.  Well, Roland pulled up Bobby the champ earlier when the mics were off, but I busted him  for it.  Yeah.  Because you remember Bobby the champ got in trouble when he interned for ONA for doing  Anthony impressions.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And so Roland walks in here while one of the bits are playing, and he stands up in front  of Anthony's mic and starts going, the future! 
[00:41:00]  Oh!  Lies.  Lies.  Eric?  Eric?  Oh, that's 100% true.  That's what I thought.  Wow.  Two liars.  And then I saw Roland go like this.  Look, everyone.  I'm open.  He starts sniffing his fingers and fingering his own ass.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And I said, I go, Roland, Opie doesn't do that.  You think Opie does that?  I thought so.  No, he doesn't.  It's just an impression.  When you do an impression, you take it up a notch.  Yeah, I guess so. 
[00:41:30]  But Roland, he'd be offended by that.  Oh, I'm open.  I'm open.  And I'm like, that doesn't even like him.  It's not cool.  Nobody even gets it.  No, it's not cool.  No.  Did you hear, though, your competition, because I feel like the main competition for the first  hour of the Ron and Fez show has always been Jim Norton on the Boneyard.  Jim Norton's on the Boneyard?  I thought it'd always been a thing on your side.  No.  That you just couldn't get those first hour numbers.  No.  Because Norton's on the Boneyard at 11am every day.  Uh-huh.  Today, Ron and Fez wins 10pm is when Norton is moving to. 
[00:42:00]  See, here's the thing.  Talk is always going to beat the rock.  Yeah.  He plays a lot of rock over there.  He does.  He plays his favorite songs.  He talks in between, but still.  Could he do me a favor and get some Judas Priest songs if we could on the Boneyard?  I think he could arrange that.  And who's the run to the Hills band?  Uh, Iron Maiden, right?  Iron Maiden.  That's always been my dream is to have Jim Norton doing Iron Maiden rock block.  If he could get one of those on.  That's your dream? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  You don't have a lot of them.  And send it out to RB.  I'll know who he's talking about.  Yeah, I don't have big dreams.  You like that personal touch.  I'm not Sam and Dave.  Oh, one day we want to take over the gaming industry.  I don't need all that.  That wasn't our goal.  And after Saturday night, we'll never, ever have that.  Because all we have is enemies right now in the gaming industry.  I know, and here it's serious too, because the bad reviews I got was from Rob Cross.  Oh, God damn it.  And Mark Zito.  Mark Zito gave us bad reviews?  He said it was a clusterfuck. 
[00:43:00]  Speaking of...  That's the only person I heard from.  Well, Mark Zito is also known not to tell the truth always.  He's a liar.  He's probably looking out for number one.  Yeah.  Uh...  That's his piss.  Is Pepper...  Yeah.  Is Pepper Hicks back today?  Yeah, there's some great pictures too that people have been sending me of Pepper and Austin.  Well, I heard the one that he sent Mark Zito was just a picture of some people.  Right.  And nobody could figure that out exactly.  But the pictures that I saw, somebody gave him an Obey the Giant shirt that apparently  he wore pretty exclusively. 
[00:43:30]  At South by Southwest.  That's a place where people are supposed to be like kind of very cool and up to date  on what's going on.  And he rocked the Obey the Giant shirt.  He did.  I thought that would be like South by Southwest maybe 10 years ago.  I don't even know if 10 was...  15?  Yeah.  It goes back a ways.  Hunter the Giant was still alive when...  But he's retro.  That's the thing about him.  Oh, I got it.  So he's taking it back.  God, we're dying without the Storm Chaser.  I know.  But you were worried before.  I was.  About Mark Zito handling the show. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  You said Pepper Hicks had no one to help him.  As a matter of fact, was your quote, that there was just nobody.  Yeah.  How did the two days without Pepper Hicks go?  It was good because I said, Fez, are you happy or sad about your dad?  And then I sat back and I just let him go on for a while.  That was your strategy.  You just get Fez to talk about Fez.  Right.  And then you'd be able to fill our time.  How is Fez doing?  Oh, he's great.  Is he?  You know what?  He finally hit a thing where he's comfortable in his own skin.  So he's really doing great now. 
[00:44:30]  And his favorite topic of conversation is his dad?  Well, right now that's his second.  That's the latest sadness.  And is that the tease for Ron and Fez as well?  It is.  You're going to hear more about Fez's sadness.  That's the tease.  We were listening to Best of Ron and Fez two weeks ago on the way home from Special Delivery,  me and Jess.  And she said, I can't listen to this.  It's too sad.  Fez is just talking about how sad he is about his dad.  Why would they put that on the Best of?  I don't know.  It was like, you want to listen to a hopping show.  By the way, Roland does an impression of Jess now. 
[00:45:00]  What?  Where he's just sniffing his fingers and rubbing his ass.  Oh, Jess is...  It's not funny.  No, it doesn't make any sense.  He's doing it for everyone.  It's the same impression.  It's definitely not cool.  No, it isn't cool at all.  That's for sure.  That's not cool.  Well, Ron and Fez comes up live next.  More of Fez's dad talk and a whole lot more.  You can promise that, right?  Oh, no.  Okay.  No, it's just the same thing.  Just that.  But I'll tell you this, we will also be having a funeral for Jim Norton's hour. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah!  Where we bring in a casket because we buried him and knocked him to 10 o'clock.  Listen to the show that defeated Jim Norton on the boneyard, Ron and Fez, after this.  Thank you for listening.  It's been after Opie and Anthony live.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next. 
[00:46:00]  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
