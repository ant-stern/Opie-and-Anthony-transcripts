<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with excited discussion of an upcoming "Anti-Social Network" comedy show in Atlantic City featuring Opie, Anthony, Bill Burr, and Jim Breuer, including speculation about ticket sales and a potential tour. This segued into an "Idiot Debate" on gun control between show regulars "Stalker Patty" (anti-gun control) and "Nervous Oscar" (pro-gun control), punctuated by the hosts teasing someone for pen-chewing.  One host then recounted a detailed sexual encounter with porn star Brie Olson and mentioned receiving a suggestive tweet from a transsexual individual.

The show then shifted to a cynical critique of Dr. Phil's interviews with Ted Williams, focusing on Williams' struggles with alcohol and family issues, playing clips and highlighting the hosts' belief that Dr. Phil was exploiting Williams for ratings.  This was followed by a discussion of a viral video of a rat on a subway, prompting anecdotes of rat encounters and a debate about the video's authenticity, including a caller's story about hitting rats with two-by-fours.

A later segment began with a humorous, expletive-laden account of the hosts' experience battling a mouse infestation in a vacation rental, detailing their methods of extermination and discussing the ethical implications of different traps.  "Stalker Patty" then shared a fictional comedic anecdote about a young Patrice O'Neal.  This part also mentioned several guests: Bill Burr, Chris Russo, and Stacey Keech, whose acting career was briefly discussed. The "Idiots Debate" on gun control between "Stalker Patty" and "Nervous Oscar" was also referenced here.  The segment concluded with unrelated discussions of the movie *Dilemma*, Obama's speech, Piers Morgan's CNN debut, Gucci Mane's tattoo and legal history (including a video of him punching a woman), the Jersey Shore cast's "GTL" trademark controversy, and a brief phone call with Bill Burr, ending with reflections on the comedy world.

A subsequent segment featured Bill Burr and Jim Norton as guests.  They discussed Burr's acting experiences, including negative feelings about his role in "Date Night" and a prior experience on "Apartment 2F" with Zach Galifianakis, where he recounted an edgy bit about AIDS testing and eating his own testicles (though the latter wasn't shown on air).  The conversation then moved to the upcoming Jets vs. Patriots game, the Seahawks' playoff berth, the Ravens-Steelers game, and the Yankees' history.  A pre-recorded interview with Max Weinberg by Primetime Sam Roberts was also included.  The "gun debate" between "Stalker Patty" and "Nervous Oscar" resumed, marked by Patty's prepared arguments and Oscar's rambling responses, including tangents about horse tranquilizers and a surreal comparison of guns to penises.  The debate continued after a break, with further sports discussion promised.  Burr also promoted his shows and CD.

Another segment started with a bizarre anecdote about a girl and a cat killed by a stray gunshot.  This led to another "Idiots Debate" on gun control between "Stargapack" Oscar and "Stalker Patty," with Patty declared the winner.  This segment included Bill Burr promoting his shows and podcast, Jim Norton promoting his "Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution" DVD with explicit anecdotes, and Stacy Keach as a main guest promoting his FX show *Lights Out*.  Keach discussed his career, including anecdotes about roles like Mike Hammer and his experiences in theater, working with George C. Scott and Marlon Brando.  He also shared his experience playing Richard Nixon in a *Frost/Nixon* stage production.  The segment included discussions about older versus newer TV shows, the Jets-Patriots game, and further promotion of Burr's shows and Keach's *Lights Out*.

Yet another segment focused on upcoming comedy show dates for the hosts and Bill Burr (who was in studio).  Discussions included anecdotes about performing in Austin, Texas, crude comments about Shelly Long's attractiveness, a prank on Bobo involving a farewell promo, Jim Norton detailing his physical therapy revealing an atrophied buttock cheek, discussions of medical checkups, Munchausen syndrome by proxy, the death of Del Martin and portrayals of lesbians in older media, workout routines and muscle building, a story about Burr accidentally taking a wrong train and ending up in a Denny's, fan interactions, awkward encounters, the death of Leon Shermer, a hostage situation in Iowa, the Illuminati, microchipping, Jim Norton's past drinking problems, and Jimmy's cringeworthy attempt to woo a high school girl.  A caller, Jesse, shared a similar embarrassing teen story.

Finally, a segment focused on embarrassing romantic attempts in youth. Jimmy recounted a disastrous love letter, a failed self-inflicted broken arm attempt for sympathy, and witnessing his ex with another man. Mark shared a story of writing a fake breakup letter.  Callers detailed their own romantic blunders, including a coded love note, a power ballad composed on the toilet, rolling a cannonball into a church service, and a car crash after drinking and driving.  Dennis recounted discovering his girlfriend cheating with his best friend.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy, the next minute you're acting like a  big giant ass.  He's got a ton of fun.  Oh my God.  It's fucking brilliant, man.  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape.  Yes.  It's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How's everybody doing?  Oh, I'm well.  You're well?  I'm healthy.  Happy.  It's under the weather today.  He's sick.  That's sick.  I check email.  I never check email in the morning.  Yeah.  It was like one of those things where you just, I don't know why, I woke up and checked  my email and I got Ann's email.  That's like my big premonition story.  It's a really uninteresting one.  Like, you know, some people would be like, I knew not to get on a plane that day and then  it crashed in the Indian Ocean. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  I had, I had, something told me to check email and I found out something that I would  have found out two minutes later when I texted Kenny anyway.  Exactly.  So there really was no premonition.  It's all good.  We got a busy show, actually.  Bill Burr's coming in.  Bill Burr will be here.  One of the comedians doing the whole, what's the name?  What's the name of the show again?  Anti-Social Network.  Anti-Social Network.  I just know it as four great comedians getting together for a night of lofts.  Yeah, I think most people just kind of should have been on the poster, by the way.  It was a little long for that.  It was a little long.  Yeah.  But, yeah, the big shows go down in Atlantic City this weekend. 
[00:05:00]  Tomorrow, and it's myself, Attal Burr, and Brewer.  And I think the late show might be sold out.  I know the last time I checked, there were under 100 tickets and that was like four days  ago.  So what do we got?  Two shows tomorrow?  We have 8 o'clock at 11, I think, for tomorrow and then one Sunday.  And then one Sunday.  The Martin Luther King holiday.  And then you hit the road with this thing.  We, uh...  You should.  If everybody wants to do it, we have to get everybody together.  If everybody wants to do it and do more, I would be very interested in doing more.  Yeah, I think you do a little short tour with this thing. 
[00:05:30]  Why not?  Five or six dates, maybe, in some of those bigger cities that you guys all do well in?  Well, it's great because the pressure is not on any one guy.  It's like everyone...  Look, the reality, any performer will tell you, you know, we do events, you're worried  about tickets, you want tickets to sell.  Yeah.  So it's like, I think people who are kind of like all of us are like, eh, tickets are  not that expensive.  65 was the highest one.  Right.  So people are like, all right, fuck it, let's just go see four people, whereas they might  not have come out just to see any one of us.  Yeah, it's going to be a great weekend down there.  I'm looking forward to it.  I am, too.  I'm actually looking forward to seeing Brewer. 
[00:06:00]  Brewer?  Yeah.  Tell I see kind of often and Bill I see often.  Jim, I just never see unless he comes in here.  Yeah, all you guys are...  It's going to just be great.  Thanks.  See, I'm looking forward to this one.  Right on.  A lot.  All right.  Is Oscar here ready?  Yeah.  Damn.  He's ready.  All right.  We're going to try something today because all week long everyone has been talking about  guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, and guns.  So today we're going to have our own debate on guns. 
[00:06:30]  That's right.  But instead of doing it, you know, Anthony versus somebody, it's going to be Stalker Patty  and Oscar, Nervous Oscar.  What's the first ever Opie and Anthony idiot debate?  Idiot debate.  I like the name.  Production around it.  It's going to be a whole big deal.  Yeah.  There's going to be...  We're going to have to figure out the rules.  If everybody needs to make a one minute statement and then a rebuttal.  The rules?  Seriously?  It's a debate.  This whole thing's going to fall apart in two minutes.  I don't think so.  Stalker Patty's going to...  They both have an opening statement, I guess, and then they just kind of argue it out. 
[00:07:00]  What?  And then within five minutes we're bored and we'll move on to something else.  I don't think so.  I spoke to Oscar and I've been helping him with his viewpoint.  He's pro-gun control.  And he's really been getting his information together.  Is he really pro?  Yeah.  I mean, he said his basis for his theory is that he's scared of guns.  He's scared of himself.  Correct.  He's scared of his own shadow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you imagine Nervous Oscar with a gun there, Jim?  No, I cannot.  I cannot imagine Patty with one either. 
[00:07:30]  Unless it was...  She couldn't even lift it up to fire it properly.  Her being pro-gun is going to be great.  Just to hear this blithering idiot trying to describe why she should be able to carry a gun.  Right, right.  Wait, wait.  Patty's...  Patty is anti-gun control.  So it's pro-gun.  So it's pro-gun.  Oh, and Nervous Oscar is...  He's pro-gun control.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I totally got that wrong.  Yeah.  Okay.  So Stalker Patty wants a nice piece in her hands.  Right.  And Oscar doesn't think anybody should have guns. 
[00:08:00]  What's wrong?  Who chews fucking pens in this day and age?  It's so disgusting.  Who does...  Who chews...  There you go.  It's so disgusting.  Here you go, marker chewer.  There you go.  It's in Jimmy's ass.  There you go.  Enjoy that.  Just, yeah.  Keep it over there.  Don't forget that...  Don't forget that you put it in your ass.  But you got the bidet, so is it really that bad?  Oh, it's immaculate.  It's more principled than anything.  All right.  And Oscar pretty much wants to get some guns off the streets.  Yeah, Oscar doesn't like it.  He's very eager, though. 
[00:08:30]  He's here.  He was here at 545, ready to do this thing.  And he's amped up.  He doesn't come in.  Like, all of us just kind of drag in here.  And Oscar is just like...  You could see him at 5 in the morning, at noon, at 10 o'clock at night.  I like to call it mosey.  We like to just mosey.  Not Oscar.  He come in.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  Hey, what the...  How's everybody doing?  Oh, good.  Yeah, he's ready to go.  Should be good.  So they'll both do an opening statement and then go back and forth a little bit.  Yeah.  The first idiots debate.  Yeah, they want to convince you guys and the listeners of their side. 
[00:09:00]  Okay.  And I think we're going to make a difference.  There's an art to debating.  You ever see a Sean debate?  Well, we're not going to see that today.  But I mean, there really is.  A lot of times you have to take a stance you don't believe because you have to just win  the point.  Yeah.  It's all about the debating and the arguing.  There's never even sincerity.  It's about how you can make your point.  So, hopefully they will both be skilled in that art.  Well, I talked to Oscar and he does have an analogy that I don't want to spoil.  I'm not going to give it away.  But it won me over.  Oh, he had a practice in front of you? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I asked him what he was thinking.  And he said, well, I came up with this analogy while I was drunk.  Oh, that's good.  So it should be terrific.  And it was good.  And what about Stalker Patty?  Is he getting prepared?  His analogy is probably it's all pink on the inside.  And he fucked his friend.  Travis has been working with Stalker Patty.  I refuse to work with Stalker Patty because I'm coaching Oscar and we're going to win  this thing.  Okay, you're coaching the Oscar.  And Travis, you got an update on Stalker Patty and how she's preparing for the gun debate.  Yeah, Patty says that she has done a lot of work and she really did her homework on 
[00:10:00]  this.  And then she said she's just a little scared of Anthony.  And I reminded her that Anthony is on her side.  I said, don't worry about Anthony.  You just have to worry about Oscar.  But I think she's very prepared and she's going to be very ready.  To beat Oscar.  Travis has been championing Stalker Patty all week.  I actually haven't.  I've really just been getting in touch with her.  So why don't you guys have a little side bet to see which one does better?  Which guy does better in the gun debate? 
[00:10:30]  I've been trying to stir up some competition the whole week.  Yeah.  And Travis has been informing me.  I don't care.  I'm not on Stalker Patty's side.  I'm just calling her.  Leave me alone.  Whereas I'm saying my guy is going to beat your guy.  Travis, come on.  Come on, Travis.  You've got to get behind a side on this one.  You've got to get behind your guy.  Well, I don't have to.  Or your virgin.  Yeah.  No, Travis, you've been coaching Stalker Patty, you know.  I will back her.  I do think she will do better than Oscar. 
[00:11:00]  No, hell no.  No way.  Okay, maybe you're right.  See?  I won that debate.  What side bets do they have?  I say, how about the...  It's got to be a good side bet.  Jimmy's really good at side bets.  The loser eats the winner's ass.  I don't think so.  You know what?  That's not really a bad idea.  It's not a bad idea, Jimmy.  I'm all right with that.  You can both be declared winners.  Nothing but winners here today.  Everybody wins.  All right, so that's a little later on.  Bill Burr's coming in.  I don't even...  Well, he's coming in because he's in New York, obviously. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  And he's gone.  The show doesn't need to be pumped at all.  No, the tickets are done.  Yeah, and then we've got Chris Russo talking about the big games.  The big games this weekend.  I've got to find a place to watch the Jets down in AC.  Oh, on Sunday.  I'm sure it'll be...  Yeah, I don't...  I want to...  I might just stay in my room and watch the game because I like to hear the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  But a lot of fans down there, a lot of Jets fans, a lot of Pats fans.  It could be a good atmosphere.  That might be a cool place to watch.  Oh, there's plenty of cool places to watch down there, so...  Is it Saturday or Sunday?  Sunday.  Oh, okay.  Sunday, 4.30. 
[00:12:00]  4.30, right.  And then Stacey Keech is coming in at 9 o'clock.  Yes.  Is he still alive?  Yeah, I hope so.  I guess he is if he's coming in.  As of yesterday, he was.  This show is called Lights Out.  Right.  And it's really good, man.  I saw the first three.  We get these advanced DVDs.  I really liked it.  I thought it was a half-hour sitcom.  So I was like, yeah, I'll watch four or five.  And I sat down.  I'm like, oh, fuck, it's a drama.  It's an hour.  But it was great.  You had to sit through...  I watched three of them.  Three hours.  Well, I'm a little loopy. 
[00:12:30]  I haven't slept because I just laid in bed and couldn't sleep.  So it was like fucking 2.50.  Uh-huh.  And I woke up at 3.50.  I just laid in bed for an hour.  And I just went and watched another episode.  Wow.  I backed about at 4.50 and didn't sleep again.  And you like it?  I do, yeah.  Oh, good.  The guy from The Wire's in it.  He was in season two.  The smart white guy from season two.  The season a lot of people didn't like from The Wire.  Because it was the first season where they saw a switch.  Well, because it felt like a different show.  Yeah.  And then they went back to, you know, the projects and all that. 
[00:13:00]  Hardcore for three, four, and five.  I loved season two.  Yeah, season two was all right.  Yeah.  Definitely all right.  Showed you the docs.  I was sitting here getting ready for the show.  And I guess there's a movie reviewer.  Her name's Pat Collins.  She's been in New York forever.  And she's given a preview for The Green Hornet.  And I'm sitting here thinking, why would I want, like, a 70-year-old woman to tell me  if I should see The Green Hornet or not?  She said it's dumb but fun.  That was her tagline?  Dumb but fun?  Three out of five stars. 
[00:13:30]  Dumb but fun.  But I'm looking at her.  I remember seeing her as a kid doing movie reviews.  What does she know about what's fun for anybody under 70?  Yeah, I mean, she's into, like, comic books slash action slash funny movies.  Maybe she's kept her inner child alive throughout.  You think?  I think so.  I think that's almost impossible at 70.  Maybe it is.  And I just turned off the, I didn't want to hear what she had to say.  Maybe I should have listened.  I don't know.  Did you see Wall Street, the new one?  No.  I liked it.  Oh, you saw it too?  I watched it on the, I got it on my Netflix, on my whatever, so I can watch it on the, 
[00:14:00]  make myself stay on the elliptical longer.  Right.  And I watched it yesterday.  I was surprised how much, I didn't love it.  Right.  But it was better than I thought it would be.  You liked Shia, Shia LeBeau?  Shia LeBeau was good.  He was good.  Yeah, I mean, he was, no, she wasn't, Charlie Sheen was better in the first.  Uh-huh.  And it was a little hokey, some of the storyline in this one.  You think the original movie was hokey and we just didn't know?  No.  For the time?  Nah, because he won the Oscar for that.  And the cell phone wasn't a little hokey on the beach? 
[00:14:30]  Not for then.  I know.  I mean, now it's like, what's he fucking holding a Toyota against his face?  I heard they had a scene where they kind of made fun of the big cell phone.  When he's getting out of jail.  Oh, getting out of jail.  They gave the big cell phone back.  Right.  I heard about that.  But Martin Sheen was in the first one.  Like, there was some...  They didn't have Martin Sheen in the second?  No, I mean...  How much is he doing that?  He couldn't do a day or two of shooting.  I'm sure they would have, but he probably didn't want to do it.  You know, he's Martin Sheen.  I know, but, you know, Wall Street, you know, he had a big part in the original.  Yeah.  Charlie had a cameo. 
[00:15:00]  Charlie might be going back to rehab.  I know.  How do you not love Charlie Sheen?  Charlie, they're saying, is looking a little too thin.  And they might have to take him to rehab.  Someone said he was in Vegas with Brie Olsen and Michelle McGee.  Michelle Bombshell.  And Brie?  Brie?  Yeah.  And Brie and one other girl.  That's great.  We know the Brie.  Yeah.  Did you call Brie and ask her about it?  I haven't talked to her in a while, no.  Because my girlfriend wouldn't be happy if I was calling a fucking hot porn star.  Extremely hot porn star that just wants to have sex with you. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, that wouldn't be good for the relationship.  She did that one time.  I don't know if we, you know, if she would again.  I wouldn't now anyway.  Wait, what do you mean?  Did you?  Yeah.  I don't know if you officially admitted that.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Absolutely.  I don't think you officially admitted that until just that.  I don't think she would care.  Unless she's embarrassed by it, she should be.  Yeah, I don't think you, I think we kind of like talked around it.  It was very, it was hot.  It was towards, was it like, because they talk about everyday sex or regular sex and then 
[00:16:00]  porn star sex.  What was it?  It was nice.  It was like, it was weird.  I went to her, she was staying in Jersey in a hotel and I went, we had been talking a lot.  Did you make you out?  We did, man.  Yeah.  She's a great kisser.  Like she was your girlfriend?  Yeah.  I was totally single at the time.  So I would, I would have fucking, I would have knocked her up if she wanted.  She was so hot.  Are you making a joke or is that something that happens inside?  In that moment I would have, no, we had sex. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, that's hilarious.  And I kept, I was obviously going to come quickly.  Right.  So I had to keep stopping.  Yeah.  Because there was no bag involved.  She was, she was great.  And we hung out for a while.  We hung out for a few hours.  Just laid around, made out.  It was, it was very sexy and it was fun.  We talked for a while and she was really cool.  Yeah.  I mean, then she left, she was, I go, she was leaving town and.  Wasn't that intimidating to have sex with a porn star?  Yes and no.  I mean, it really wasn't.  And I, and I would have, cause I have before, but I, with her, she was like a bigger name  than the one I had before. 
[00:17:00]  But it wasn't because I had been talking to her a lot and she was really cool and we  knew her from the show and I didn't really think it was going to happen anyway until  I got there.  I think we would just hang out.  I'm so used to those girls being just kind of cock teases.  I'm never thinking we're going to fuck.  Sure.  And then we got there and it just, it actually happened.  Very easily too, right?  Yeah.  I mean, we had a chemistry.  Back then.  I remember that.  That goes back a few years now.  Yes.  About three years ago.  About three years ago.  She had a, she had a, she had a big time crush on you, man.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if she realized what she was in for and then she saw me without clothes.  I'm sure that wiped it away. 
[00:17:30]  That's why I had to, I had to act immediately.  Once the clothes were off, while she was still stunned.  While she still had the fucking deer in headlights look.  You had to get right in there.  Yeah.  I had to before she realized what was happening.  How bad did you want to have sex with her with your shirt on?  At that moment I didn't care cause I just like, I know I'm going to ruin this somehow.  But I think I lost my rod a couple of times.  I say shirt cause we all know you have fine legs with really nice calf muscles.  I'll show, I'll show them off to anybody.  Lance Armstrong was, or Lance, what's his name?  Not Lance Bass.  I'm too tired.  Who's the one bald biker?  Oh, it was Armstrong.  Okay.  You were right the first time. 
[00:18:00]  I was thinking Neil Armstrong.  Um, I wanted to come at her and she told me I could, but I don't know if she meant it.  I didn't.  But I would have back then.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  I liked her.  We never talked about this on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really liked her.  You were, you were downplaying it.  So.  Well, it was like, she doesn't care now.  I mean, it's like, you know, it's a couple of years ago and whatever.  Right.  She's, I still like him as a person.  Like if I saw her, I'd still love to talk to her and be friends with her.  She's a very cool person.  What is she on the Twitter?  Brie Olson, I think.  I don't, I think so. 
[00:18:30]  Give her a little plug.  Brie Olson on Twitter.  Yeah.  She actually tweets some, uh, some fine pictures of herself.  Yeah.  I got, I got a tweet, um, from some transsexual.  It was very funny.  In Vegas tweeted me a business proposition.  Really?  To come fuck her in the butt.  It was very funny.  It's a hell of a business.  Yeah.  It was so funny.  I, I, I wish I would have responded.  It was like two days ago.  I should have responded.  Something funny.  If you were single, where are you at with that?  No, I wouldn't do that.  No. 
[00:19:00]  But I, I, I, I'm still going to respond to something.  I should respond, like, you know.  You got to retweet that with a little response somehow.  Uh, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  It's great.  I just told my girlfriend to get mad when I'm going to Vegas.  Telling a girl what a pig you are.  It's like the thing that you always have to like, no, I'm not.  There's always that.  So there's, there's no, there's no good coming out of being honest.  Well, there is.  I mean, cause it's like, it's not like she judges me or things, you know, she doesn't  care.  Mm-hmm.  But any chick is naturally going to, you know, be suspicious if they know you're garbage. 
[00:19:30]  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, Dr. Phil is talking to our pal Ted Williams there.  He had him on all week.  Yeah, I know.  He did three days with him.  And man, it sounds like I, I, I was watching here and there that Dr. Phil set up a nice  party for Ted Williams and his family.  Of course.  A really nice hotel.  It seems like he got rooms for other family members cause they don't live in LA and, and  those family members, they don't think they have a, a drug or alcohol problem. 
[00:20:00]  So they're partying and they're bringing bottles of booze down at Ted Williams room.  Cause they want to see their father.  So Dr. Phil was just giving him all the temptations to make sure he got a Friday show.  And I, you know what?  Cause in the end it is entertainment and it's, and, and, you know, Dr. Phil wants big ratings.  It's kind of like some of the shit we do.  Yeah.  You got to think that Dr. Phil, uh, kind of set up some, set up some, uh, some opportunities  for Mr. Williams to fail at.  Filling up the mini bar.  Yeah.  Something.  You know, I think, I think it works out much better for Dr. Phil and his ratings in a show 
[00:20:30]  if Ted Williams is drinking.  No, he had it locked, didn't he?  The mini bar was locked or something.  I don't know.  It was locked, but I mean, you know, LA, really nice hotel rooms for your whole family.  They haven't seen each other in a while.  So you know what that's about.  Let's got money coming in for the first time.  He's got money.  Yeah.  Let's go out and have a nice dinner.  Yeah.  Everyone else is drinking around you.  You know, the temptations were all over the place for this guy.  And that's the first thing he said when he was on that radio show the day after his YouTube  thing came out. 
[00:21:00]  He said, uh, that he doesn't understand that he would like to, his first thought is to  have a drink to celebrate.  Right.  And so obviously.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  So, uh, yesterday's Dr. Phil show, I guess it, it came down to, down to the rehab thing.  Yeah.  He, Dr. Phil was talking to him and, uh, confronted him about the fact that this guy, like I said  yesterday, uh, we said yesterday, uh, we all saw this comment.  This, you're right, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm just, it's just fucking log on.  Oh, the good old log on.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, I've been, uh, you don't know how to log on?  I do.  And I know I'm typing it in right.  It's, it's, it's.  I, I was doing the same thing.  It's right as you know.  They have the most complicated password here at SiriusXM for the Wi-Fi.  Like, what are they worried about by having it that complicated?  Right, Danny?  I guess they don't want.  Yes.  Jimmy, what are they worried about?  I don't know.  Are people going to stand on 6th Avenue and steal their Wi-Fi just 38 floors down? 
[00:22:00]  Just, just stand on the, on the sidewalk with their iPhone or the iPad to get a little Wi-Fi?  It's fucking idiotic.  What do we got, government secrets here?  They try not to even tell people around the building that it exists.  Yeah, it's a dopey radio show.  The rest of the place is filled with dopey radio shows.  Why, why the, why the complicated password?  I don't know.  There's no reason for it.  The fucking lowercase that's case entity.  Lowercase and then a number that looks like a letter that spells a word.  Word that doesn't go with the other word they, they came up with.  It's not letting me, Danny just did it, so I'm not doing it wrong. 
[00:22:30]  It's not letting him on?  No, on my computer.  What is that about?  I don't know.  All right, well.  Fucking piece of shit internet.  I hate it.  The internet?  Yes.  You're just blaming the whole internet?  Yes, I am.  So that means you've got to blame Al Gore.  Yes, I do.  Blame Al Gore for that.  Dr. Phil offers Ted Williams rehab.  Oh, yeah.  What I was saying, this guy is not going to turn it around.  No, no, no.  He doesn't have the right people around him.  His family wants him to turn it around, but they're also seeing dollar signs, so they 
[00:23:00]  don't want to do too much tough love because they're a little scared that Mr. Williams is  going to cut him off.  Because Mr. Williams has hinted at that.  Do you get the clip where he's calling his own daughter a piece of shit and all that?  No, no, no, no.  I forgot the salty language he used, but he completely trashed her, calling her, I think  it was a welfare whore, and you'll be nothing, you've never been anything, and you'll never  amount to anything in the future.  Because they're trying to take care of some family problems within three days with Dr. 
[00:23:30]  Phil.  Yeah.  The guy hasn't been around in over 20 years.  He's been around here and there, but in three days, Dr. Phil's going to fix Ted Williams  and his entire family.  Oh, that Dr. Phil's a miracle worker.  That's a joke.  And by next week, Dr. Phil will move on to somebody else and not care about Ted Williams.  So, oh, you just got the rehab clip?  Yeah, just the...  I wish I had that other clip.  Yeah, me too.  I should have told you.  All right.  Maybe you could get it for later.  Yeah.  Here's Ted admits he was lying, and he has been drinking, something we and everyone else  thought and said.  Because I have your best interest at heart. 
[00:24:00]  I don't want anything from you.  If I run into you five years from now...  I'm going to stop that right there.  He doesn't want anything from Ted Williams.  He wants big-time ratings, which he's getting.  Everyone's talking about Dr. Phil this week.  That's why he's got to get rid of Ted this week, because by Monday or Tuesday, nobody's  going to care anymore.  And all these clips are being played on all the entertainment shows.  I don't want anything from you.  Of course you want something from him.  I don't want anything from you.  I already got it.  We want the same fucking thing that Dr. Phil wants.  We want Ted Williams in studio. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Exploit him a little bit and get a little attention for the radio show.  That's driving you nuts, huh?  Why would it work?  Why would it?  What's the fucking password?  They don't change the password, right?  No.  Yeah.  I know how to log.  I'm hitting it right.  I think I'm on.  Unless they knocked me off.  It looks like I'm on.  I don't know.  Oh, does that annoy me?  All right.  Here's Dr. Phil and Ted Williams.  If I run into you five years from now in New York or Miami or L.A., and I see you across the street, I want you to go, 
[00:25:00]  Hey, Dr. Phil, let me introduce you to some guys that put me on the right track when I wasn't.  Okay?  That's what I want.  That's all I want from you.  But now to do that, you've got to be honest with me.  Straight up.  And when we sat down before, were you 100% honest with me?  99%.  And the only 1% that I was honest about was forgiving myself. 
[00:25:30]  How about drinking?  I've had a drink.  So that wasn't honest.  Right?  Yes.  Okay, I'm just, you know, I respect you enough to be straight with you.  I'm not going to play games with you.  I'm going to be straight with you.  I hate you.  You've been drinking, and you haven't been honest about that.  And I get that.  I know that it's hard for you.  That's why you do need to go to rehab. 
[00:26:00]  But this Dr. Phil really breaks ground.  You mean the homeless guy that was urinating outdoors last week lied and is still drinking?  Yeah.  No surprise.  Dr. Phil doesn't play games.  He knows.  And I think Dr. Phil is not helping this guy.  No.  He's hurting his career because, you know, people that want to hire Ted Williams is hearing these clips just like you are out there.  And now they're probably feeling a little uncomfortable, like, oh, my God, are we really going to commit, you know, a million dollars or whatever the fuck it would be to this guy?  He's going to fall apart in front of our eyes. 
[00:26:30]  This should all be done behind closed doors.  He's not quietly slipping into rehab and getting his life on track.  He's doing it on television.  Yeah, of course.  Like, we would have him on, and yes, of course we would exploit him.  But Dr. Phil understands what this is doing in the end.  This should be behind closed doors.  We would exploit him, but then we wouldn't say, we have your best interest at heart.  We would say, we are exploiting you.  I would love to know.  There's probably a guy out there right now ready to sign that check for a Super Bowl commercial for Ted Williams, and now he's hearing the Dr. Phil clips thinking, you know, the Ted Williams thing was fun, but we don't really need him. 
[00:27:00]  We don't need the baggage.  Let's fucking move on immediately.  Dr. Phil's a douche.  I've got another clip here.  You need to go from here, go straight to rehab.  That's what I recommend.  I'm not going to make you do it.  And if you don't, I'm not going to worry about it, because I'm telling you the truth.  I'm stepping up and telling you the truth. 
[00:27:30]  I don't know what to say.  You can man up to it.  I've got faith in you.  You can man up to this.  I hear you, doctor.  I don't know.  Listen, you don't want to do it?  Don't do it.  Thank you, Dr. Phil.  What is this, a reservation only?  I've got to get in at a certain time?  Or, you know, if I don't go today, I can't go tomorrow?  You know, it's that kind of feeling I'm getting.  It's like, I feel pressured.  Jimmy, what are you hearing here?  You've been through this. 
[00:28:00]  Complete denial.  Right.  But again, it's hard to fault this guy, Ted Williams, because Ted Williams was snatched up out of obscurity.  He's just a guy who's not ready.  Right.  And it wasn't like he approached fame.  He was just talking, trying to get a couple bucks.  Right.  And the next thing you know, he's a household name.  I mean.  Yeah, he just blew up within six days.  I'm sober 20-something years, and that would be hard to handle.  Like all this, you know what I mean?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Something like that would be possibly a trigger for you?  Dude, over, like.  Overnight? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, like that.  I don't think I would drink.  But again, it's like the sex would be worse.  I know that I would spiral somehow if all of a sudden I was everywhere mainstream.  Yeah.  Like that fast.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so this guy's in denial.  He doesn't want to go to rehab.  He's not ready.  And he's saying no.  The funny thing is I have this visual that Dr. Phil's trying to get him into rehab, and Ted Williams is like, eh.  And I have this visual that Dr. Drew is outside on the street just waiting for Ted Williams to leave, because he'll give it a shot, too. 
[00:29:00]  They all want him.  And I'll bet that Dr. Drew.  They all want him to look like an idiot.  On their TV shows.  Dr. Drew will get him, because Ted Williams will stop being popular within a couple weeks.  Right.  So six months from now, he'll be on Celebrity Rehab.  Yeah, let me say hi to Shane in Westchester.  Shane.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing today?  Hi.  Doing well, brother.  Hey, listen, I just want to say I listened to the other guy on the other channel that just re-upped his contract.  You can say Howard Stern, sir.  It's fine.  Jesus.  We're not offended by this. 
[00:29:30]  The reason why is I didn't have you guys, but I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I had my head up my ass.  I finally signed on last November, and I'm loving it.  Thank you.  But what I'm noticing, and by the way, you guys, you're all geniuses.  Sam, E-Rock, Jimmy, Anthony.  You left one fucking name out of it.  Thank you, sir.  You piece of shit.  Go fuck yourself.  What do you got?  I apologize.  No, no, that was calculated.  That's fine.  What do you got?  No, it isn't.  No, it isn't.  You named everyone except me, asshole. 
[00:30:00]  No, you're a good guy.  And E-Rock, you put me in a category with E-Rock.  I apologize.  I love you.  I'll do anything.  Make your fucking point, Shane.  My point is this.  I've noticed a little rut before vacation when you came back.  You know, it's one thing, it's Ted Williams' situation.  The one thing I signed on, you guys, you guys are creative in what you approach your daily show with.  Make your point, Shane.  Move on.  Get rid of Ted Williams' story.  Get rid of the tactics.  Get some other creative material on the show.  Jimmy, I love you.  But I just want to say that.  Shane.  Shane. 
[00:30:30]  It is still in the news, Shane.  Shane.  Shane.  Shane.  People.  All right.  If you're going to be like that.  All right.  Thanks, Shane.  Thank you.  Shane, it is still very topical.  And we talked a lot about Jared Loeffner and that because these are things that are still in the paper.  It's not like it's gone.  I mean, if you want to talk about stuff, we used to beat shit in the ground years ago.  But, I mean, Ted Williams, this thing is still fucking red hot.  The guy was on Dr. Phil yesterday admitting he is drinking.  That's something everyone was wondering about.  And Dr. Phil's trying to get him into rehab. 
[00:31:00]  It's still a big fucking story.  Yes.  That's why SiriusXM has all these channels.  Go somewhere else for a while.  No.  It doesn't matter.  They don't have ratings.  We don't even know how many people listen to our show.  It don't matter.  The old days, it mattered.  We would beg you to stay.  But I don't even know how many people listen to this show.  No one will tell me.  So, go to the Blues Channel or something for a while and come back.  It's not going to hurt us.  Here's the final clip from Dr. Phil yesterday.  I'll tell you what let's do. 
[00:31:30]  Please.  I've got Rich Whitman here, who's the director, that was going to offer to escort you there.  If you want to go to Columbus, we'll just have him make a detour with you to Columbus.  You can tell him where to stay there.  And instead of going straight back there, he'll go there.  And then he'll just go with you from Columbus to there.  Now, that'd be fine.  Then I'll get up and hug you for that.  You like that idea?  Yes, sir.  How flexible am I? 
[00:32:00]  You're a beast.  You're a beast.  You want to go to Columbus?  We'll go to Columbus.  Thank you.  Are you happy now?  Yes, sir.  How long you want to stay in Columbus?  Just a couple days.  Now, you're not going to get there and change your mind.  No.  No.  I promise you that.  I promise you that.  All right.  So, he gets yanked out of Columbus.  He comes down to New York and meets pretty much everybody in entertainment.  Is he New York or L.A. right now?  I think this is all in L.A.  So, then Dr. Phil flies him out to L.A. for his big party with his family in the nice hotel. 
[00:32:30]  And now he wants to go back to Columbus for a few days before rehab.  What's that about?  I wonder if there's a girl he wants to see or something.  He obviously didn't bring his girl with him.  Right.  I wonder if he's afraid that it's all going to go away if he goes to rehab.  Like, even though he was drinking.  But I wonder if he's afraid.  Like, I get paranoid that stuff's going to go away.  Like, this guy is all of a sudden famous and maybe he's afraid that he's going to go to rehab and no one's going to care about him in a month.  Yeah.  And he doesn't know what to do.  And that's exactly what's going to happen.  Yeah, because he'd be out of the spotlight if he's in rehab. 
[00:33:00]  He's in a tough spot.  And, honestly, in the end, the golden voice thing can only get you so far.  The story itself is amazing.  That's a homeless guy with this great radio voice.  But then when that part of it settles down, Jimmy, there's a million guys with great voices in the business.  If he goes away right now, which he should, Dr. Phil is actually giving him the right advice.  Go away now before he fucks up.  All he did was have a family argument.  Everybody knows this guy was homeless last week.  Like, everybody's going to give this guy a little bit of leeway.  He didn't fucking hit anybody.  Yeah.  If he goes to rehab right now, he's still a story when he comes out. 
[00:33:30]  Because it's like, wow, people will still feel like, look, we, the collective, helped him.  Look, YouTube did something good.  We helped this guy.  He's okay now.  People will still love the story.  If he goes now.  Yeah.  But if he does something stupid, like assault somebody or has a violent confrontation with his daughter, then he's got a problem.  But an argument, everybody has that.  Look at Charlie Sheen, the way this guy's constantly forgiven.  You know what I mean?  It's like Ted Williams is fine if he just goes now. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, he's in a tough spot, though, man.  He's in trouble.  And this Dr. Phil, not a fan.  No, but he is giving him the right advice about just go away right now.  Right.  Just go.  Like, you're drinking, you're lying about it.  Yeah.  Well, is there another Dr. Phil show with Ted Williams today?  Or is this it?  Dr. Phil has to move on to another storyline, right?  It's Friday, though.  Oh, you see the subway fucking rat video?  Oh, yeah.  That thing is everywhere today.  I didn't see it.  Some guy, I can't believe, I tweeted, well, it doesn't matter, just turn on your TV, it's 
[00:34:30]  everywhere today.  But a guy on a subway train, there's maybe, I don't know, six or seven people on the train,  homeless guy sleeping in the corner.  All of a sudden, there's a rat on the actual fucking train inside, running up and down.  And then this guy's just filming it, running up and down.  And then all of a sudden, it jumps on the homeless guy that's sleeping and wakes him up.  It's funny how, like, one rat, like, Voss would be horrified of that.  Right.  I would be a little weirded out, too.  Oh, it jumped on him because it was scared.  Oh, here it is, yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, wow.  Well, because it's trying to figure out how to get the fuck off the subway.  And then it's jumping up on the chairs.  Look at the people.  They're all just looking at it.  They're not even moving.  It's right.  Look, they're just lifting their feet.  They're just lifting their feet like it's no big deal.  And then it gets this homeless guy that's asleep.  Oh, wow.  Right in his face.  That Voss would have a stroke with that.  It ran up his leg.  Yep.  Right by his face.  Yeah.  And then he just brushed it off and it jumped off.  You saw it, too.  The best part of the video is the fact that no one else was affected by the rat being on the train. 
[00:35:30]  I would be out of my mind.  I would be.  I swear to you, I would be standing on one of those seats.  I wouldn't be.  But I wouldn't expect it to run up the leg either.  That would give me a stroke.  Like, that would be like a violation.  Like, I thought you weren't going to do this.  Here's the understanding.  I don't kick at you and you don't run up my leg, asshole.  Big mouse.  Why are we so completely freaked out by rats?  Because I think they've always represented disease and bad situations and grime and dirt and poverty. 
[00:36:00]  Like, you never see rats.  That's why we're not affected by poodles.  And rats eat what we throw out.  That's why we hate flies.  They eat garbage.  Roaches eat garbage.  And I don't do the subway as much as I used to.  But it's almost a guarantee, while you're waiting for your train here in New York City,  if trains haven't gone by in a while especially, it's almost a guarantee you walk to the edge,  you'll see a rat almost every time.  Plus, in New York, like, anything that is theoretically everywhere that you can't see, 
[00:36:30]  like, just the idea that rats are everywhere and you can't see them is horrifying.  And they do bite babies.  They are creepy.  They can crawl on you.  They really are horrifying.  Damn it.  We've got to be the show that says this.  Thank you, JD, in New York City.  He writes, the rat video is a setup.  And I was just looking at it.  I swear to you.  I'm going, wait.  Like, something's not right about this.  Because why is no one else on the train freaking out?  And JD writes, if you're going to see the video again at home, check it out for yourself.  The rat video is a setup.  The rat is too well-groomed. 
[00:37:00]  It has a better haircut than I do.  Yeah, subway is much more ragged than that.  I wonder if someone released that just to fucking try to get a video going.  Maybe, but.  What do you think?  That seems like.  It almost looks like one of those rats from the season finale of Hoarders.  You know, one of those pet shop rats.  Yeah, it maybe is, but it's hard to tell from a video.  That rat could just be an indoor rat.  It could just live in the subway. 
[00:37:30]  JD's pretty good, though, man.  I'm now officially suspicious of the rat video.  I want to go on record just in case the guy comes out and says, yeah, we fucking set that up.  Maybe.  But how the fuck did the rat get on the train?  I took it out.  Closed, and all of a sudden the rat appears.  The rat just runs on, yeah.  It could have been on at 2 in the morning.  It could have just ran on.  It could have been in someone's bag.  I mean.  He could have it in his bag already or in his coat.  That's true.  And says, I'm going to release this thing.  You got your camera rolling?  Let's go.  Yeah, that's true.  Let's have some fun.  I think it's a real rat. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, a real, you know.  Well, it's a rat.  I mean, I think that's a real just outdoor rat.  It's pretty big.  It looks like the size of rats that are on the street.  I've held rats.  A friend of mine in L.A. had them.  She had two.  They were big fucking rats like that.  Yeah.  And I let them both crawl up my leg.  And I actually filmed it just because I knew Fawcett would have a stroke.  But they were domesticated, but their claws are very sharp.  They still creep, yeah.  And they make that. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, but they were fine.  You ever hear a New York City rat scream?  No.  I call it a scream.  We got too close to one one night, you know, a night of partying, walking home, going through  the brownstones in our neighborhood.  And we see one.  Dark street.  I've told the story a couple times, but it was on a garbage pile, I guess.  And we tried to get close.  It was kind of in the dark at this point.  And it must have had babies there or something.  The sound this fucking thing made to basically say, get the fuck away from me, was horrifying.  Yeah, maybe it's kind of a... 
[00:39:00]  Horrified.  Maybe there's a nest.  Yeah.  Anything that lives in a nest that isn't a bird gives you the creeps.  Oh, absolutely.  Bees, roaches...  Snakes.  Spiders.  They don't have...  They have webs.  They don't have nests.  Oh, no, they nest.  When they're making their...  When they're reproducing and they have...  Their eggs.  They have like this egg sack, but it's kind of like a nest.  Oh, yeah.  And it's really disgusting.  The word nest is creepy.  Especially if you've ever seen one burst right before your eyes.  It's fucking atrocious.  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little tiny spiders just in every direction. 
[00:39:30]  Unbelievable.  I'm officially going on record.  That's fake.  Why?  Now that I'm seeing it a couple times, we're playing in the background, it's fake.  It's a real rat, but it's like a pet store rat.  Anything with like a vertebrae that's that flexible that they can squeeze into cracks that  are too small for them is creepy.  Well, rats supposedly, their bone structure is set up in such a way it just all collapses  so that they can get inside space that's like, I hear, up to a dime.  Well, they're made of a...  A hole that's like as wide as a dime. 
[00:40:00]  A cartilage they're all made of, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and they are able to somehow just kind of sort of collapse all that shit when they  have to get squeezed through, you know, tight spots.  Them and roaches, they'll survive anything.  Yeah.  Anything.  They're going to fucking survive nuclear war.  They're going to be here.  Oh, yeah.  And they adjust.  They adjust to what we're trying to do.  Why do we get so creepy?  I don't know what it is about.  Anything that lives in nooks and crannies in the city grows...  Like, I'm not as grossed out by a roach like in the South because there are a lot of times 
[00:40:30]  it's hot and it's outdoors.  Like, you'll see one in a clean place.  Yeah.  They don't freak me out as much as they do here.  Roaches might even freak me out more than rats.  There's just something about seeing a fucking roach.  It's also like...  Because you've been told you see one roach, you're infested.  They're somewhere else in your apartment or wherever the fuck you saw them.  Because you feel out of control.  Like, with an animal, if there's a big animal and you kill it, it's gone.  Like, even when the exterminator comes and gets rid of roaches, you assume that they're 
[00:41:00]  everywhere because you can't see them and everybody tells you they're everywhere.  What is that, Danny?  It's a nest.  That was a big, gigantic spider nest.  The video, the description says he pokes it and all of them come out, so I'm just  kind of waiting to see what happens.  Oh, he's going to poke.  I thought it was a spider.  Yeah.  Maybe a roach nest.  Yeah, they absolutely build some nests.  Yeah, they're a little creepy.  What about a good old hornet's nest there, Jimmy?  Oh, those videos I saw of the guy who actually had one in his apartment.  Remember I was showing you those?  Oh, yeah.  And the guy would brush his hand on the back of the hornet's nest.  They are creepy, but I'm a little less afraid of them now that I've watched that guy's 
[00:41:30]  fucking movies.  Like, hornets really probably won't bother you unless they really feel threatened.  Like, they just kind of circle the nest and cause a ruckus.  My friend Jimmy Biondo punched one down.  When we were in high school, he was crazy, and he was like one of those guys that would  just drink way too much, and he was in the woods, and he just fucking punched a low-hanging  one down.  Did you guys get stung?  He did.  I wasn't there, but I heard about it.  Didn't he get stung yet?  Wow.  They weren't happy.  Well, Charlie from Staten Island, he's a little braver than us. 
[00:42:00]  Charlie, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, all of you.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Welcome aboard, Charlie.  17, we used to go out and get drunk, and then we'd go over to a store on Forest Avenue,  and there was a patch of woods between the dumpster, so we'd get ready with the car.  One guy would go over and shake the dumpster, and they'd run back to the woods, and we'd  hit them with two-by-fours.  The rats?  Yeah, the rats.  And one night, I was the guy shaking the dumpster.  I had one in front of my leg. 
[00:42:30]  That was the last time we did that.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be a deterrent.  I think so.  Mars said, he once told me that when we were at the other building, I might have told you  guys this before, that the rats, they come under the garbage.  So, like, the garbage men had a game where one stood with a stick, and they tried to remove  the garbage bag as quickly as possible before the rats scurried away.  I don't even know how you could be a garbage man in New York City, or any big city.  That's got to just be fucking horrifying.  Yeah, I'm sure they see them. 
[00:43:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  What the hell do they, you think they're immune to it at this point?  Well, not on them, no, but I'm sure we're just seeing them, you get used to it.  They're going to projects where they're all over.  They probably understand, you know, their patterns and stuff, and understand, you know.  There's a supermarket that's like, from my parking lot, I pass it every day, and unless  it's like cold, like really cold, like this morning, when the garbage is out every morning,  you see, like, I've seen nine, ten rats just all packing around this.  Right outside the supermarket?  Yeah, oh yeah.  That means they're in the supermarket.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  The owner of this supermarket doesn't care?  I haven't talked to the owner.  I don't know.  That's why I'm not mentioning the name of it.  And if you've noticed, the whole community has noticed.  Oh yeah, they're all over.  I mentioned it before, I used to throw trash in, like, eastern Queens, like, Main Street  Flushing area.  Yeah.  And, you know, if anyone local knows the area, it's not exactly the cleanest place in the  world, but it's not as bad as you'd think.  Sure, there are rats, there's bugs, and all that stuff, but, like, when you  come to a huge pile where you just know that some shit is in there, eating stuff, you just  take a stick and you just beat all the bags for a few minutes, you know, not minutes, 
[00:44:00]  but you just take a once-over to the bags, and by that time, everything runs out, and  then you can just sit there and work.  Jesus.  I don't know.  It's not as bad as anything.  The worst part for me, though, is when I walk by a garbage can and they're hanging on  a metal garbage can, they have a weird, they almost jump off like a person would.  Like, they hang with their claws, and you can almost try to balance their back claws, and  it looks like a little person rat, and the creepiest thing is when they're doing something  like hanging off a garbage can.  Yeah, this is just part of living in New York.  Yeah.  I wonder if the rat problem is as bad in the other cities. 
[00:44:30]  I'm sure Boston has a bad rat problem, I would assume.  Yeah.  I would assume.  Oh, Boston's old.  Any old city?  Any old city along the water, especially.  Yeah.  The worst place.  Because the fact is, the rats aren't from here.  They came over here from ships.  We weren't even supposed to have rats.  I know.  The worst place for rats I saw was 57th Street when we were over there.  We were constantly outside the building.  I never saw rats outside there.  If you had to get there early, like 4.30? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  All the time.  So Iraq never saw a rat?  No, he never.  You wouldn't have seen one.  I'm only kidding, Iraq.  Don't be so sad.  I was walking from XM to CBS one time down 57th Street, and I thought that the wind was  blowing a pile of leaves across the sidewalk.  And I started looking closer, and it was like 30 rats that were running from under a car  across the sidewalk into the vacant lot that was next door to us.  I wish that you had the urge just to jump in the leaves, and then you realized that you 
[00:45:30]  were jumping onto rats.  Just try to roll around.  Yeah, they fell in love with your hair.  Rats almost killed me a bunch of times.  I used to ride my motorcycle into the city, and I would park all the way on, like, close  to the west side, pretty much.  But there was always garbage, whatever garbage day was, and there was always rats.  Right when I pulled into the garage, they'd freak out and run out, so I would be at a  very slow speed trying to dodge rats as I'm pulling into my garage in the city.  It was pretty tough sometimes.  Yeah, they are fucking, they really frighten, they are frightening little beasts. 
[00:46:00]  And I don't know what it is, because mice, but I used to do this gig in Lancaster called  the Villa East.  The comedian stayed in the back.  It was behind the, it was like a motor lodge.  Right.  Fun gig, though.  And fucking, there was two little awful rooms, like in an old shed, and that's where the  comedian stayed.  Right.  The opening two comedians.  The headliner got like a real motel room.  But there was always field mice coming in the room.  Always.  You always had mice.  Right.  Like, literally, every night you would just see the one running along the wall.  Yeah.  It wasn't as gross, though, because you knew it was from a field in Pennsylvania, so you 
[00:46:30]  knew it was like an outdoor field mouse.  It wasn't like a rat.  Right.  And it was just much more tolerable.  But you didn't get freaked out, like going to sleep, worrying that...  No, field mice, I got to jump on you.  Now I would never, I mean, a man like myself would never, if there's not like cloths in  the bathroom, I don't stay.  We rented a really nice house, and did I tell the mice story from the Outer Banks?  Oh, I don't, I rent, you know, I rent a house, not every year, but here and there, you know, 
[00:47:00]  in the Outer Banks, on the ocean there, and the house we had this past summer was infested  with mice.  This one you just went to?  Yep.  Got some money back for it, but still.  Yeah, it's, it, actually Sam came down for a couple days, and he found a fucking mouse  in his room, right?  Yeah, it was the first night that we were there, Jess and me, like, uh, she had brought, she  had food in the room.  It was just like a bag of, like, Hershey chocolate or something.  Aw.  I know, it was just a little sweet.  And, uh, all of a sudden it was like two or three in the morning, and we just kind of 
[00:47:30]  heard some rustling, and we were like, what, what, I wish.  So, uh, so, rustling.  We turned the lights on.  Very good.  We turned the lights on, and Jess was like, I think there's something in my bag.  And I was like, oh, what is it?  And she was like, oh, it must be a frog.  And Jess used to catch frogs when she was a little.  Must be a frog.  She thought it was a frog.  What wishful thinking.  It was a little.  Just because she likes frogs?  Oh, it's a unicorn.  Oh, it must be a panda bear. 
[00:48:00]  Maybe it's gold.  The gold is so exciting to my purse.  It's jumping up and down.  My purse meaning Jess, because I was acting like Jess.  Thank you.  Sure.  She saw this little dark thing, and so she thought it was like a little frog, and it  jumped out of the bag.  Oh, no.  And so she was like, oh, it must be a frog.  And I was like, oh, well, you should catch it, because she catches frogs, like, from when  she was a kid.  Aw.  Yeah, and I was like, oh, this is no big deal.  I can just go back to sleep.  And then she was like, oh, it ran to your side of the room.  And so I was looking around, and then I saw it scurry across the floor, and I was 
[00:48:30]  like, Jess, frogs don't have tails.  They don't run either.  Yeah, they don't.  They hop.  They don't run.  And they ribbit a lot.  I just love that you found a girl that you're going to marry.  Yeah.  That she goes to the nicest thing it could possibly be.  It's frog.  When everyone else listening would think the most horrific thing when I hear something  rustling in their bags.  I'm not thinking like a nice frog or a tiny little kitty.  I'm thinking rat.  She was happy to greet it. 
[00:49:00]  Rattlesnake.  Yeah, exactly.  She wanted to welcome it to the room.  What a goody two-shoes she is.  Did she want to just sprinkle pixie dust in the room as she tried to catch her frog?  But it was a feel mouse.  We couldn't catch it, so we ended up just chasing it out of the room.  Hitting it with a hammer.  And then we shut the door, and we put like towels under the door so there was no crack  in the door and nothing.  And we turned the lights off, and we went back to sleep.  And like 20 minutes later, even though the whole door was blocked off and everything,  that mouse was back rustling in the exact same bag. 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  Well, they won't let me on.  No, you're still not on.  Nah, why would I be?  So to ramp up the story, so then we're aware that the house, you know, my family's there.  Yeah, everybody was surprised.  My wife's family from Philly's there.  So now we're suspicious, and now we're in the upstairs living room slash kitchen area.  It's one big room.  It was like a few days later, because we'd seen the one mouse, and everybody was like,  oh, we haven't seen anything.  And I'm sitting on the counter, Jimmy, and all of a sudden I hear rustling coming from  underneath the stove. 
[00:50:00]  So we all just, the women went to bed, I'll be honest with you.  And me and the hardcore Philly guys, I can barely compete with them, trust me.  We're just hanging out on the counter.  Here in the rustling, we decided to be really quiet, and here they come, one after another,  baby, from underneath the stove.  You watched them?  Watched them, oh yeah.  How many?  Thank God that there were stool seats, a lot.  We counted at least 10.  Oh no, that's infestive.  Oh yeah, and they knew where to run in the room when we tried to chase them, and they 
[00:50:30]  had other places to go, and then they disappeared, and then they're popping out another hole over  here.  And my brother-in-law picked up a fucking broom, and the Philly came out of him, he knocked  one of them right the fuck out.  And now we're playing a game.  Now we're like idiots, like having coronas and getting tools of destruction to try to  kill these fucking things.  Because the house across the way had just been exterminated before you got there, which  means that all the mice that were exterminated ran out of that house into yours. 
[00:51:00]  When you exterminate your house, you're just fucking your neighbors.  Yeah.  That is what it is.  So then it creeped us out for the last two days of our vacation.  We didn't even know they were there.  I was down there for two weeks, had no idea until late first week, I guess.  Something like that.  Yeah, that was free.  No, no, early second week.  Oh, we went right to a hotel.  Right to a hotel.  Really?  There's no hotel.  There's not even any roads.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Drive right on the beach.  I didn't even know how the mice got there. 
[00:51:30]  I didn't know mice liked the beach.  They don't.  They like the house.  How'd they get to the house?  But they were field mice.  That's why I was reminded of this story.  Field mice, they scurry and move a lot fucking faster than the mice that infestated my brownstone  before I moved.  Those mice were slow and easy to catch.  You could grab those.  Oh, yeah, you could.  These field mice, though, they know how to fucking move.  Quick.  You almost think you're not sure if you saw them.  They're that fast sometimes. 
[00:52:00]  And they run along the wall.  They're smart.  Oh, yeah, they do.  And it drives you crazy because you think you've gotten rid of them, and they fit into anything.  So they're back.  They always come back.  You know how mad a mouse must be when it steps on a glue trap?  Like, what the fuck is this?  I heard about these.  Oh, no.  Look, man, unless...  Sam just drooled.  So happy that happened.  I was emotional.  I hope that's a sign of really bad health coming.  Like, your brain clot just overblend.  And I should have learned my lesson from years ago when I had all those mice in, like I said, 
[00:52:30]  the brownstone, because we used the glue traps.  We ended up using glue traps down in, you know, the Outer Banks.  Unless you don't have one emotional cell in your fucking body, don't use the glue traps.  Because they're still alive.  Even if you fucking hate mice, it's so damn depressing.  And they make little noises, basically saying, begging and pleading with you to fucking free them.  And their fucking ear and their face is stuck to the fucking thing.  And you see that most of their hair has gone off their body because they've been struggling all night to free themselves. 
[00:53:00]  It's brutal.  Their little penises are stuck.  That'd be the way it's called.  Their little penises.  Right.  So then you've got to go barbaric and you have to take it outside and just crush them with the heaviest thing you can find.  Just to get rid of them.  Next thing you know, you feel like you're a fucking serial killer.  It's like, what the fuck?  I just want to get some sun and relax down here.  There's no way to get some mouse off the thing without killing it, right?  No.  Dude.  Dude.  It's stuck.  No, man.  It is a brutal way to take them out.  Fucking brutal. 
[00:53:30]  I'm sure the PETA people aren't happy about glue traps, I would imagine.  But I guess you've got to do what you've got to do.  Yeah, there's got to be a better way.  Well, I learned those electric traps rule.  One of the listeners gave me that black electric trap with this, with the, they go in, they have to turn right and then turn left.  And then at the, at the back wall is peanut butter and those fuckers can't back up.  And they take a little taste of the peanut butter and they fry instantly.  Why can't they back up?  That's, because, I don't know.  Someone figured out, I guess they can't back up easily. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, they turn up.  Because of the turns.  Yeah, there's a, there's a turn in the, in the, in these, uh, in these electric traps.  That would suck too.  You walk into a hallway, you're like, ah, it's pizza.  Nice thing you know, you're stepping on a fucking circuit.  Nothing more, nothing more creepy though.  Uh, I'm with, you know, my girl, we're watching a movie, the lights are down, nice and nice.  It's, you know, you, you got your place set up for a nice movie and you got one of those electric traps in the, in the kitchen.  And every once, every once in a while during the movie you hear, so, you know, they've been just kind of crawling around in the kitchen and one guy in the trap. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And obviously is them being executed.  Death has just visited you.  And then you, and then you, you walk into the kitchen, you turn the light on, you see the trap in the corner and you see the light just blinking.  That means you got one.  Ugh.  Fucking creepy.  It's the whole thing out?  No, then you, there's a lid on top even.  You, uh, open up the lid and turn it over.  The, the, the fucking thing just drops into your garbage and then you set it up for the next one.  You put peanut butter over where the last mouse's brother died. 
[00:55:00]  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just horrible.  Oh, fuck them.  Horrible.  What, they live somewhere else?  Yeah.  All right.  Shoot a person for breaking into your house.  You can kill an animal.  We, uh, we got a busy show.  We got.  Somebody, uh, he bailed.  If, if the Pats-Jets game goes late on Sunday, could you guys delay the beginning of the show a little bit?  Um.  It's going to be close.  4.30 and what time do you guys go on?  8?  We go on at 7. 
[00:55:30]  No, I'm kidding.  We go on at 8.  Oh.  8?  Uh, I imagine we would.  That should be enough time.  Yeah.  I.  Should be enough time to, to watch the Jets beat the Pats and then, uh, go over to the venue  to see Jim Norton, Bill Burr, David Tell, and, uh, Jim Brewer.  I have to, can't plug one thing?  Yeah, hit it.  Um, the, the, the, the, the, wellmont, wellmonttheater.com, 10 o'clock this morning.  My March 5th tickets go on sale in Montclair, New Jersey.  And this weekend I'm going to be selling my CD for the first time.  It's called Despicable.  It's, and, uh, it's also available for pre-order on Amazon. 
[00:56:00]  It's not out until March 8th.  Wow.  But I'm going to be selling it.  Yeah, I, I wanted to have some for the Borgata.  I wanted to, like, kind of premiere it there and sell it there.  But, uh, it's not available for pre-order.  You're going to sell a shitload.  I hope so.  I hope people go to Amazon and pre-order it.  This way they know it's a success.  You better, you better bring about 50 or 60, man.  You're going to sell a shitload.  I have eight.  And that's optimistic.  All right, we got a busy show.  Uh, Chris Russo, I said that.  Bill Burr's coming in.  Stacey Keech is stopping by to say hi. 
[00:56:30]  And, uh, Nervous Oscar and Stalker Patty doing the Idiots Debate today.  Yeah.  A new bit we're trying today.  And, uh, they're going to debate gun control.  So.  And they're both here.  And they're both here.  I wonder, we should, uh, we probably should wait for Bill Burr for that one.  Yeah.  Bill would have a lot of fun listening to those, uh, to debate about guns.  Just tell Bill not to make fun, though.  Yeah.  No making fun.  This is very serious.  The whole nation's talking about it, including us.  Hello, everybody.  The whole nation's talking about it.  Hello, everybody.  I'm Stalker Patty. 
[00:57:00]  Throughout my life, I have heard some of the most wondrous tales, and today it brings me great pleasure to now share one of them with you.  Our story begins with a young Patrice O'Neal.  Growing up in the dangerous streets of Jersey City, the adolescent comedian was full of hope and looking forward to life.  One day, during a game of pickup basketball, Patrice noticed someone out of the ordinary.  He was playing basketball. 
[00:57:30]  Just some dude was around.  He was just lurking.  He was lurking.  He soon recognized the man and immediately became startled.  He was notorious, this guy.  He was fucking a public enemy, this guy.  Something was about to go down.  The man shouted.  Hey, yo.  Patrice replied.  Yo, what's up, yo?  The individual was becoming angry.  He's like, yo, man, what the fuck you mean, what's up?  Patrice now knew he was in trouble.  I said, whoops.  All of a sudden, the man confronted Patrice with a damaging tale. 
[00:58:00]  He said, yo, nigga, you the nigga that was fucking with my cousin, yo.  Yo, what the fuck you, you keep being to be fucking with my cousin, nigga.  The story sounded preposterous.  Patrice didn't know this woman.  I was like, what cousin?  I was...  The man shouted.  Then Patrice's worst fear now became a reality.  He just, he didn't even pull it.  He showed me the G of the gun.  He was being held up.  The fucker, he stole, I had one of those breakdancing.  I was the first motherfucker to have a breakdancing puma suit. 
[00:58:30]  He took my 4X tall puma suit.  Might have been sneakers, because I had the breakdancing puma sneakers, too.  I was dressed, I was dressed like Ozone from Breaking, nigga.  Patrice loved his puma suit, but he loved life even more.  When he said, go around the corner, I get the fuck out of here.  I walked around the corner.  As soon as I didn't see him, you've never seen a 300-pound person run that fast.  And run he did.  Patrice ran and ran away from the dangers of the streets, the thugs, and the clowns. 
[00:59:00]  And I ran, and I think I looked back and I saw them peeking.  They was not going to chase me, because I ran fast.  And that was pre-diabetes, so I would have walked over glass and everything to get the fuck out of there.  Cut up feet, rocks.  Patrice ran all the way home.  And eventually, that young comedian found his way into our hearts.  This now concludes our tale.  Thank you for listening. 
[00:59:30]  All right, you've got me and Jimmy today.  In a little while, Bill Burr will be joining the program.  Also, Chris Russo to talk about the big games this weekend.  Football.  And Stacey Keech.  Stacey Keech from Lights Out. 
[01:00:00]  Lights Out and many, many other things.  He was in Up and Smoke.  He's been in a shitload of movies.  Yeah, he was in Up and Smoke.  Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane.  Like a million.  He's on a very long, long resume.  What is that?  I forget.  It was just, I forget what it was about, but I know I like it.  It's been that many years.  He has been around for a long fucking time.  I see you've got Dilemma up there.  How's that doing?  What?  That new movie, Dilemma.  Am I saying it right?  I don't know.  Dilemma. 
[01:00:30]  Dude, his movies go back to 1953.  Really?  A TV series, Cavalcade of America.  How old is he?  He's got to be at least 70.  Yeah.  He looks really good, though.  No, I'm just curious what movies are coming out and which one I want to see.  I'm not going to see fucking Kevin James in a movie.  Sorry.  No thank you.  And Vince Vaughn.  He's having a rough run, isn't he, Danny?  The Vince Vaughn.  You know, I was never into it.  Me neither.  Like, people like his movies. 
[01:01:00]  Like, I couldn't even tell you what his movies are.  Like, I don't know him so much.  Yeah.  Ron Howard would have called in today, but we said no because he could have come in and  he didn't.  Which is not, it's not a fuck you, though, but I'm glad we didn't.  Why is Ron involved with this movie?  Did he direct it or he produced it?  I'm guessing.  Is it a producer credit or did he direct it?  He directed Kevin James?  That seems a little weird.  And then the Green Hornet is getting a really good review in one of the New York papers and  getting a really bad review in the other papers. 
[01:01:30]  Well, the younger one is probably enjoying it more, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  People are very confused by the Green Hornet because I think they were hoping for some  svelte actor to play the Green Hornet and they got Seth who's going to just make  it really funny and fun, so.  Mike Hammer.  I'm going to watch, I'm going to go see the Green Hornet.  God damn, he's been in a lot of fucking stuff.  Oh, Stacey?  His fucking resume is eight pages long.  And my personal favorite of Stacey's, world's most amazing videos on Spike TV, which doesn't 
[01:02:00]  air anymore, but it was just police chases and people getting fucked up and their faces.  Yeah, he narrated the whole thing.  It was fantastic.  Holy shit.  He's Mike Hammer, for Pete's sake.  Yeah, he was Mike Hammer.  Green Hornet, 43% positive reviews.  But once again, that's what the critics are saying.  People going to the movie, 7 out of 10 like it, 71%.  And what about Dilemma?  One moment, please.  24%.  It's not looking good.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Moving right along.  31 million people watched Obama's speech on Wednesday.  Holy shit.  Do we have any clips of that?  Because I really heard it was tremendous, and I have not heard it.  They're online.  They're everywhere.  I know, but I thought I'd rather just hear it.  I liked it.  You know, I'm not a big rah-rah Obama guy.  People get confused.  They think I'm an Obama guy because I saw that he was going to win the election way before  most people.  I said, this guy will be the president.  And then I started, you know, screaming Obama and all that.  But it didn't mean I actually was, you know, for him. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  I don't really carry the way.  That's my problem.  I don't carry the way.  I wanted a black president, and I wanted something different than we had.  They said he sounded and looked presidential for the first time in a while.  And he did very well.  Yeah, I kind of wanted to hear what he said.  I like the fact that he said he came.  But then the critics are saying, you know, the college, it sounded like a pep rally.  I guess the college handed out T-shirts, I guess, and kind of made it, you know, a little  more upbeat than maybe some people would have liked it to be. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe people just try to make something so negative.  Who knows?  I noticed that the energy was a bit high.  But then halfway through it, I was thinking, you know what?  Yeah, why not?  I like this angle.  Instead of the somber, we all know it sucks for a lot of people, including, you know, the  families.  Why not?  This lady's going to live, though.  They kept it upbeat.  Yes.  What did she do yesterday?  I don't know.  I think she fucking, I think she ran around the block.  Yeah.  She's fucking recovering him quickly. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I think she played a game of racquetball.  Yeah.  She squeezed her husband's hand and played asteroids.  Right.  And went back to sleep.  Amazing.  Yeah, it's amazing that she has any brain function at all.  I forgot what they said she did yesterday, but it was pretty fucking amazing stuff.  Stuff I don't think I could do when I first wake up in the morning.  Dude, I can't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A bullet went right through her skull and she's doing more.  All right.  Hey, uh, the Piers Morgan is starting on CNN.  Man, he's, he's the new Larry King. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  He'll probably be good at it, too.  I, I, I hope they don't soften him up because he, you know, he, he tells it like it is.  Better than Simon, by the way.  Because when Simon Cowell was telling it like it is, when these little girls were trying to make it in the music business, I love your bit on that.  Oh, that gets old one, yeah.  I know it's an old bit, but, and I don't want, just do it real fast.  Just the, the gist of it, I mean.  The point back then was something about, I thought he was, that his targets were soft.  And again, that's who's going out for American Idol. 
[01:05:00]  But the brutality he was hitting these, because these people had nothing.  And it was like, the only thing they, they thought about themselves is they were good singers.  And even though they didn't have the talent to make it, he was kind of humiliating them.  And it's like, he wouldn't speak to a fucking, a thug like that, like a rapper like that.  Like that, that annoyed me.  Because to me, it was, he was hitting an easy target.  He wouldn't speak that way to the guy that just got the ice cream cone tattoo on his face.  Yeah, who is that guy?  Holy shit.  His face looks delicious.  Have you guys seen this picture? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  You don't have to ask what flavor it is.  It's obvious.  Yeah, it could be coffee.  That's true.  You can't just assume chocolate.  It could be coffee.  That's a tattoo you really don't want to regret.  Who is this guy?  Is he famous?  He's, well, here's Sam.  Sam, you know about the ice cream cone tattoo?  It's Gucci Mane.  Gucci Mane?  Gucci Mane.  How do you spell Mane?  M-A-N-E.  Oh, wouldn't it be just man?  No, Gucci Mane. 
[01:06:00]  So what does he add another fucking letter in there?  Throw a G in there or something.  M-A-N-E.  Mane.  Oh, it's M-A-N-E.  Yeah.  Gucci Mane.  Okay, I got you.  Yeah.  So it's an ice cream cone?  And then what?  Some flames at the top?  Or is that electricity?  Those are lightning bolts.  Is that a microphone or is it an ice cream cone?  No, that's an ice cream cone with three scoops.  It says burr on it.  Does he have like tattoos under his eyes too?  Yeah.  Well, I'm not sure, actually.  He might, though.  Jimmy, you think this guy's a problem?  Gucci Mane?  It just looks uncomfortable. 
[01:06:30]  It's like, what are you doing?  They look like brandings under his eyes.  It almost looks like branding.  Like what a baseball player would do instead of a tattoo.  Yeah, Jimmy's right.  Is that a branding or a tattoo?  The red, obviously, is a tattoo.  Let's get some Gucci playing.  Then again, he has like a little thing.  Yeah, Iraq, play some Gucci.  Let's hear some Gucci Mane.  He's not, he wasn't listening to the show.  He has no idea what we're doing.  No, he hasn't.  Eric's on the air.  Wow.  He's got his headphones on.  Why would he?  Can you hear him?  I don't know who he is.  No one has to work on this show.  Eric's hair looks like Hitler. 
[01:07:00]  I was beating out Jews on the internet.  Good one.  Do you know what you're doing, Iraq?  Yeah.  This is Gucci Mane.  Gucci is the best because he's got a big chain.  Right.  And it's custom made.  Is that a euphemism, Sam?  No.  It's custom made diamond Bart Simpson on a skateboard.  Right.  That's what, that's what it is.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thousands and thousands of dollars.  Look at this chain.  There's no way to make this interesting.  Yeah.  What am I supposed to do with that?  It's, I ain't saying anything bad about this guy. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I have to say, it's silly.  It's funny.  He's a fucking killer.  It's Bart Simpson.  And I said it the right way.  Killer.  Killer.  Is he famous in the rap world?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jay-Z famous or?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Where's he at?  Well.  Where's he at on the chart?  He's, he's more famous than Waka Flocka Flames.  How about, how about, uh, Lil Wayne?  Is he, no, no, no, no, no.  He's not more famous than Lil Wayne.  That's the upper tier of Lil Wayne and Jay-Z.  He's not crossed over to the mainstream mainstream yet, the way like Lil Wayne and Jay-Z have.  And a lot of other rappers. 
[01:08:00]  Correct.  Hence the, uh, ice cream, uh, ice cream tattoo on his face.  But, because now we're all talking about him.  We didn't know this guy yesterday.  He's like.  Does he like ice cream?  What does it mean to me?  Yeah.  Why the ice cream, Sam?  Because, because he's cold, you know?  What?  No, I think, didn't he say, like, he seriously said he wanted to remind his fans that he's  cool as ice?  Yeah.  So then we have to go ice cubes.  Oh, you can't go ice cube.  No, well, you can't tell.  It just looks like a square.  Ice cream, there's three scoops of ice cream on that cone, which really, you couldn't. 
[01:08:30]  How about a polar bear?  No, no, no.  Ice cream cone.  Going burr.  Burr.  It doesn't even look like an ice cream cone.  Well, because you can't get three scoops of ice cream on a cone like that.  It's a triangle of scoops.  Yeah, it's a perfect triangle.  A scoop of ice cream is the same size as the cone.  It's three circles.  Wouldn't you make it look more like an ice cream scoop?  Well, there's lightning bolts, too.  I've never seen a black guy with color in his tattoo.  Red on black skin, it works.  Yeah.  I've never seen color on a black man's tattoo before, except for him.  Yeah, it's usually a lot of just shading. 
[01:09:00]  Red is perfect.  And there's some white highlights there on the ice cream cone.  There should be.  Yeah, why don't black people...  Oh, that's good.  Well, Sam forgot to tell us.  Thank you, Brad T. in Kentucky.  He just got out of a mental hospital.  Well, he was for...  I mean, but he was only there briefly.  Oh, that's good.  Why was he in?  Did he eat his family or something?  Yeah.  In a cone?  His family.  He's had legal issues in the past, but nothing...  Nothing bad.  Nothing...  Well, I mean, nothing too huge.  He didn't kill anyone.  What kind of legal issues?  T.I. legal issues or Lil Wayne issues? 
[01:09:30]  Although I think they're the same issue, right?  Yeah, they're pretty much...  It's just gun possession.  Gun possession.  T.I. is back there now because he had drugs in his car while he was on parole.  What is he...  He had purple drank in his car.  What is he doing?  He's back in jail already?  Yeah, he's back in jail now.  How long was he out?  He was out for maybe two months.  Oh, in Beverly Hills, right?  Yeah, and he had, like, pills and codeine syrup in his car.  And how long is he back in for?  I think another year.  What?  A year of his life is gone now?  Another one.  A second. 
[01:10:00]  He just did a year.  What a dope.  We met him here that day he was here.  Yeah.  We met him in Washington, too, at his posse.  Holy shit.  That bus pulled up and we all ran.  He had a t-shirt on that said, I'm that dude.  We scurried like those rats we were talking about earlier.  He had a t-shirt on that said, I'm that dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's back in jail.  He sucks because he's good.  He's really good.  Yeah, but it's good for the credit.  It's good for the resume.  Not at this point.  Not at this point.  Why not?  Because he did a year for gun possession, right?  Yeah, he just did a year.  You can't go back for another year.  He didn't even.  He looked like an asshole.  He just. 
[01:10:30]  He put out an album.  But by the time the album came out, he was already back in jail.  He couldn't even promote it.  Why don't you see, like, the. . .  You don't see, like, the band Muse going to jail.  Because they're not hard.  What?  Just because he does rap, he's hard.  Well, just because he goes to jail, he's hard.  They were raised differently.  That. . .  That's dumb.  Was he driving?  He was driving a Maybach, I think, or Maybach.  Yeah.  Did he say it?  Smoking pot?  Why did he need the syrup in the car?  Because they had to have some syrup.  He's from the South.  They like their syrup.  They like their drink. 
[01:11:00]  Well, how does somebody drive you in that fucking thing?  That's what you're for in a Maybach.  You don't drive that.  Or is it a Maybach?  Wow.  Maybach is. . .  A Maybach you're supposed to be chauffeured in.  Oh, great.  He has enough money, doesn't he?  Oh, yeah.  I love how Sam doesn't give us the full story.  Go ahead, Kevin in Houston.  Kevin.  Hey, you guys got to look up this Gucci Mane on YouTube.  On YouTube?  Why?  He punches a girl in the face while he's rapping on stage.  It's on YouTube.  Go look it up.  I officially like him.  You forgot to tell us about him punching the girl. 
[01:11:30]  Was she heckling?  That's great.  He's done a lot of stuff.  Yeah, why did he punch the girl, Kevin?  I have no idea.  No idea.  All right.  She's probably. . .  Two minutes in on the video.  All right.  She's trying to get on stage, or I don't know.  Yeah, we'll. . .  He's a rapper.  He's a rapper.  Why did he punch a girl in the face?  I don't know.  Oh, and we're learning this little tidbit.  Thank you.  Now we go to Chad in Philly.  Chad.  Let's talk about the ice cream.  Ew.  Gucci Mane actually did kill somebody in his house.  Well, I mean, it was in his house.  Do you know this, Sam? 
[01:12:00]  I don't know anything about the Gucci Mane.  I know a little bit.  I have his rap sheet.  Oh, let's hear his rap sheet.  All right.  Gucci Mane.  We're talking about the guy.  You'll see the picture sometime today.  He's got a tattoo of an ice cream cone on his face.  With lightning bolts.  With lightning bolts.  Red lightning bolts shooting up toward the side of his eye.  And it says burr.  And it says burr?  Burr.  Yeah, it says burr on the ice cream cone.  He's actually just a fan of Bill.  And that's how they spell it in the hood.  Burr.  Burr.  What's the rap sheet over there?  So, in April 2001, he was arrested on cocaine charges and did 90 days in jail. 
[01:12:30]  So, you know.  In May of 2005, he was attacked by a group of men at a house.  He and his companions shot at the group, killing one.  He turned himself into cops.  He was charged with murder.  But then the charges were dropped because of insufficient evidence.  Good.  All right.  It was self-defense.  Okay.  In October of 2005, he pleaded no contest to a charge of assault for assaulting a nightclub promoter.  At the time the murder charge was dropped, he was serving a six-month prison sentence. 
[01:13:00]  See?  In 2008, he was arrested for probation violation for only completing 25 of his 600 community service hours.  That's less.  He was sentenced to a year in jail, released after six months.  And then this past November, he was arrested for driving on the wrong side of the road,  running a red light or stop sign, damage to government property, obstruction, no license,  no proof of insurance, and other traffic charges.  He was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital.  That's when he was in the mental facility.  Well, he sounds like a nice young man.  That's going to have a really long career. 
[01:13:30]  Gucci is the truth.  Do you want to watch this video titled,  Gucci Mane Gives a Trick-Ass Bust-A-Hoe a Falcon Punch?  Yes, I do.  That's a falcon punch.  That's what the caller was talking about.  I need to know what a falcon punch looks like.  Thank you.  Falcon punch.  If he gives a trick-ass hoe a falcon punch.  And how do you get that graffiti font for your videos?  That's him?  Gucci's been up here before.  I think it's like two minutes in, the guy said.  Oh, no.  Okay, he's coming.  All right. 
[01:14:00]  So you got a sister that's got a blonde.  A blonde.  What?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my bitch!  Wow.  What does he say?  I don't know.  It's probably a falcon punch or something.  Is that horrifying to me?  Yeah, but the thing is, Mel Gibson's a bad guy.  Right.  Like...  Yeah, but this was a trick-ass hoe. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, fair enough.  Busted.  What did she do wrong?  Yeah.  A busted trick-ass hoe?  I have to love this guy.  He handled it.  She was heckling him, and he fucking...  What?  He knocked her out.  Gucci.  She went down.  All right, you can check that out.  That's Gucci Mane.  It's on Guilty TV.  It's Gucci Mane.  It's just YouTube Gucci Mane gives a trick-ass bust a hoe, a falcon punch.  What's a falcon punch?  I guess that's a falcon punch.  That's what you just saw.  Looks like just a very impressive fucking roundhouse.  They call it something different, I guess. 
[01:15:00]  Gucci's been up here.  Good for him.  Steve, New York City.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  It's Dave.  Just say that.  Yeah, you get it right.  Yo, T.I. just got in trouble in jail because his wife was giving him a handy during a visit.  You hear this, Jimmy?  They were touching...  So now, all he had to do was stay out of trouble when he got out of jail after doing a year,  but they found the syrup in his car and some other things, so he goes back because he  blew his probation.  Now he's in jail, and all he has to do is behave, and he'll get out again and have another  shot at it.  But now he's in more trouble because his wife was giving him a handjob. 
[01:15:30]  Tiny came in and gave him a handjob.  So what?  He's in jail.  Let him have a handjob.  The name's Tiny?  Yeah.  You wonder if she was shaking people's hands on the way out?  She's from back in the day.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  You doing it for a while?  Thank you.  So, she had a BET reality show.  Yeah.  Her and Lil Wayne's girl.  Think he's ever been unfaithful to her?  I wouldn't think so, no.  Not T.I.  No, T.I.  I wouldn't do that.  No.  I don't know. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Falcon Punch is from Super Smash Bros.  I did not know that.  Now I know.  Shinebox, thank you so much.  That's Tiny, Jim.  All right.  Huh?  Tiny looks all right.  Kind of looks like the black version of Mariah Carey.  A little bit.  Travis, give me a thumbs up.  Thank you, Travis.  I wouldn't fuck with Tiny.  You wouldn't fuck with Tiny?  No.  You should fucking scratch your eyes out.  Yeah.  So, Piers is the new Larry King.  That's what we're getting at.  Yes.  And what I was saying is, Piers goes after people as well. 
[01:16:30]  And I'm worried in that CNN environment, if he's going to tone it down, if he's going  to tone it down and not be as edgy.  Well, yeah, I mean, because he's going after performers at one point.  Now it'll be like, you know, political figures.  Because here's the problem that we face on this show.  When we go after somebody, we finally learned this lesson after many years.  When we take shots at somebody, it hurts getting other people on the show from that publicist. 
[01:17:00]  Sometimes, yeah.  Or her people represent somebody else.  So, you got to know when to take your shots.  So, I'm thinking if Piers, you know, really goes after some of these celebrities he doesn't  like or doesn't like what they're saying, it could fuck up future bookings.  That's why Larry King got everybody.  He didn't piss off anybody.  And what you have to balance is what's more important.  Like, my guy might get attacked if this guy has such big ratings.  You know, I got to put them on anyway.  Like, if you have big enough ratings, you can pretty much do what you want. 
[01:17:30]  But I think everybody has to play that game with publicists, to be honest with you.  I'm excited, man, because Larry King just, you know, got very tired to look at.  And we'll see what this guy could do.  Oprah was on Piers.  When did the show start airing?  Next week, I think.  So, he doesn't do the interviews live?  No.  No, this wasn't in, like, a studio.  This was in Oprah's house or something.  It was one of those pre-taped things.  I don't know.  Is he doing Larry King or?  It's a little different.  It's not like he's just.  I'm sure it could be a little different, but is he going to have live interviews?  I don't know if he did. 
[01:18:00]  He probably will sometimes, but, like, Oprah probably wouldn't do a live interview.  And so, he went to her house.  He taped this, like, two weeks ago or something.  Well, I think Howard's being interviewed by him today.  Yeah.  So, that would be another taped interview.  So, I wonder if he's doing taped interviews.  That's all right.  I mean.  Because it starts Monday, right?  Yeah.  And he's doing Ricky Gervais, too.  Well, they released a clip.  He got to talk to Oprah.  And, well, let's just play this.  When I did the movie Beloved, which I have and still, I had and still have such a passion for, 1998, I didn't, you know, I'm not in the movie business. 
[01:18:30]  I did this movie because I was passionate about it.  And, I didn't know that you had that weekend.  And, that is it.  So, I am thinking that if people don't go to the week this week, they'll go next weekend.  So, that morning, it premiered on a Friday night.  And, I remember Saturday morning hearing that we got beat by something called Chucky.  I didn't even know what Chucky was.  And, everybody's like, well, now this in the box office wasn't what it's supposed to be. 
[01:19:00]  What was Chucky?  Probably Bride of Chucky.  Oh, really?  The Child's Play movie.  The fourth one.  The fourth one?  Beloved got beat by the fourth Chucky movie?  Well, 98.  I saw the original Chucky.  I liked it.  Yeah, Child's Play 1, 2, 3, and then Bride of Chucky, I think, was 98.  And, that was the fourth one.  It was Bride of Chucky.  Oh, so her big movie got beat by a...  A Jennifer Tilly vehicle.  The box office wasn't what it's supposed to be, and they're already predicting what the weekend is going to be. 
[01:19:30]  And, it's just Saturday morning, and I asked my chef at the time, Art Smith, make some macaroni and cheese.  And, I really, literally went into a tailspin about it.  How much macaroni did you eat?  Oh, I ate about 30 pounds worth.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  And, I literally, I would have to say, it's the only time in my life, and I use all life experiences to teach me.  God bless you.  Um, the only time in my life I was ever depressed. 
[01:20:00]  She's so good.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  She's never been depressed when getting off a bathroom scale?  I find that hard to believe.  Good delivery.  What?  Well, suck.  What is the food thing all about with Oprah?  Probably she was molested or something, and she's covering it up.  Yeah.  And, it's just an addiction.  It's comfort.  It's like drinking or drugging or any of that stuff.  But, you could, I mean, she has so much fucking money, you've got to think she's got the top chefs cooking for her.  Sure. 
[01:20:30]  And, good food.  You know, now that I have, you know, a little money, I could eat way better.  I actually understand some of the argument that Patrice makes, that it's really tough to eat well if you don't have money in this country.  It's much more expensive.  I get it.  I really do get it.  Because, there's just not good food choices around it, and if you do find something, it's usually pretty expensive.  It's a lot more money.  So, I get to eat better because I have money now.  She has, she's a billionaire.  And, my thought is, why would she go for the macaroni and cheese because she's depressed when she could probably get something else that she does really enjoy that's way more healthier. 
[01:21:00]  Macaroni and cheese is just good, though.  Yeah.  It's fucking hard to replace.  No matter how rich you are, you can't get healthy macaroni and cheese.  F.H. Riley's just voted best macaroni and cheese in America.  Get the fuck out of here.  Are you ready?  Yep.  That's incredible.  Don't ask me the source.  Wow.  It was a guy on Twitter.  Still.  But he said.  Great accomplishment.  It was a guy on Twitter.  He goes, I got to tell you, best macaroni and cheese in the country. 
[01:21:30]  I would go out there.  How many has he tried?  Exactly.  He's, by his, yeah, he used fat font, so he's got to be.  Wow, I can't beat up myself because my machine's not plugged in.  You would go out to F.H. Riley's?  I want to, yeah, just so I can have gassers on the way home.  I just never get out there because it's so far in Long Island.  I mean, my brother understands comfort food, I'll tell you that much.  There's buffalo chicken rolls I could eat all day long. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know if that's been voted best buffalo chicken spring roll in America yet.  I believe that the buffalo chicken spring rolls at F.H. Riley's are the best buffalo chicken  spring rolls in the country.  There you go.  It's official.  It's official.  400 New York Avenue.  I could eat 30 pounds of those.  F.H. Riley's on Twitter.  He just put up a bunch of pictures.  I guess my...  ...and post them on his Twitter so you can see how much fun the fucking place is. 
[01:22:30]  It doesn't need my help anymore, certainly.  Doing very well on his own.  So Oprah's eating 30 pounds of macaroni and cheese because her movie got beat by...  Chucky, the bride of Chucky.  You almost can't blame her there, the poor cow.  God love her.  I actually read a tweet that somebody was upset that Oprah, that Gucci Mane was getting  criticized for his ice cream cone tattoo, but Oprah wasn't getting criticized for her  30 pounds of mac and cheese.  Why should she get criticized for that? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  She likes to show that she's like everybody else.  Oh.  Except...  Yes.  And fatter than most people.  She is overweight.  She told her cook to make her macaroni and cheese.  Right.  Exactly.  She didn't do it.  It didn't come out of a box like the rest of us.  She just rubbed Gail's feet.  That's what friends will do.  What's wrong with friends rubbing each other's feet?  You just came up with the next bit.  Macaroni and cheese with head cheese.  Just fucking...  We all just rub in between our ball bag and our thigh and get some collecting going on 
[01:23:30]  and then we'll make some macaroni and cheese.  That really is horrible.  Pat Duffy would have ate it in a second.  I won't even eat macaroni and cheese with regular cheese on it, so...  What do you eat on it?  No, I don't eat macaroni.  Oh, okay.  You don't even eat macaroni and cheese?  I don't eat pasta.  We've been over this.  I know, but that would go with all the other shit you eat.  I know.  Everybody thinks that.  Macaroni and cheese is a perfect fucking meal.  Everybody thinks they're real funny when they go, oh, what are you going to eat? 
[01:24:00]  Some mac and cheese?  Have you tried mac and cheese?  I don't eat pasta.  No, I understand.  But why?  I don't like pasta.  Why?  I just don't like pasta.  I thought it was about eating kids' foods.  No.  Or kid foods.  No, because chicken is chicken.  It doesn't have to be fingers.  It doesn't matter.  When Sam and I were in San Diego, we ate like gentlemen, and he ate big boy food.  Chris, he had the Christopher chicken, or the chicken Christopher.  Yeah, it's delicious.  Yes.  You went to Morton's, obviously.  We did, yeah.  We went somewhere else, too.  I think...  Palm. 
[01:24:30]  The Palm, yeah.  Yeah?  And Sam found a couple of things he liked.  No, it's just grilled chicken with Sam.  Yeah.  And if they try to like...  He ate bread.  If they try to make it fancy, he just scrapes that shit right off the top.  Yeah, just leave me alone.  Just let me eat some chicken.  He ate big boy food.  Yeah.  Big boy food.  Yes.  Nice.  I sodomized him with my fingers.  Yeah.  Well, you have to after he eats big boy food.  Let's go to...  Congratulations.  Jose in North Dakota.  Jose.  Hey, what's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Hi.  Yeah, I was going to explain what a Falcon Punch is.  Have you guys ever heard of the game Super Smash Bros.? 
[01:25:00]  Well, someone said that.  What is that, an old video game?  Yeah, there's a game for Super Nintendo called F-Zero.  And Super Smash Bros. has, like, characters from all different Nintendo games.  And one of the characters from F-Zero is named Captain Falcon.  And he has this really powerful punch.  And he yells, Falcon Punch, you know, whenever he punches people.  A good example of a Falcon Punch is when that one dude punched you in the face. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, that was a fucking good one.  Oh, boy, was it?  That's a Falcon Punch.  If you go to EncyclopediaDramatica.com, you can type in Falcon Punch.  You'll see a lot of good examples.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're going to do that today.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, punch it out.  All right, speaking of Jersey Shore, I didn't get to see the second episode last night.  And as much as I make fun of this fucking show, last week I saw the season premiere for season three.  I'm so fucking in again.  Really?  It's going to be another barn burner of the season.  Because they all hate each other.  There's three girls in the house that hate Sammy Sweetheart. 
[01:26:00]  And her name's Sammy Sweetheart, so why do you hate her?  She's the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.  And she's got a Falcon Punch in her.  She knows how to fucking punch.  J-Wout thinks she knows how to fight, but Sammy Sweetheart could take her every fucking time.  And Snooki's just cute.  She grabs onto your fucking leg and holds on for dear life and makes believe she's fighting.  I like the fact that you called her Snooki.  Snooki?  Snooki.  Snooki.  J-Wout's got a serious size advantage, but in terms of just fighting and passion, Sammy Sweetheart's got that in the bag. 
[01:26:30]  We have J-Wout coming in next month, right?  Yeah.  We're all in with the Jersey Shore guys now.  Vinny's become a friend of the show.  Vinny fucking is the ladies' man.  Oh, yeah.  He banged out a girl last night.  He did?  Yeah, he locked the situation out of the room because the situation thought they were going to put her on the shish kebab or something.  I would have such an awful time on Jersey Shore.  Why?  No girl would fuck me.  Would you go out with them?  Yeah, I'd hang with them.  Would you get dressed with them and everything?  Nah, I don't think.  They should just throw you in the Jersey Shore house.  I thought of that, too. 
[01:27:00]  Because you don't drink or party or anything.  You're just going to be a bummer for everybody.  I'd be the fat-titted buzzkill.  What would you be doing in the house while everyone else is just partying and hot-tubbing and GTL-ing and coming up with the next catchphrase that America's going to fucking...  Just spraying on my older man cologne and looking at my fat stomach.  I really would be a fucker.  Just looking at horrendous porn in the living room.  You're just trying to gross people out with blood shows.  Hey, Sitch, you're not going out tonight?  You want to check out some blood shows?  Yeah, you want to see Eugene Armstrong's head get cut off? 
[01:27:30]  Would you end up getting annoyed that they were just shouting things and making catchphrases like every single night yelling out T-shirt time?  You would go to bed around 10.  You would go to bed at 10.  They would come home around 2, 3 in the morning.  They don't go out until 11.30.  And then they bring the party home to the house.  Would you be that guy getting up and telling everyone to shut the fuck up?  Yeah, I have to get up in the morning.  Jim would be trying to have a nice relaxing hot tub by himself and they would all come home.  The Sitch was on The View yesterday, huh?  That's a great booking for The View. 
[01:28:00]  The Sitch.  What the fuck did he say to the ladies?  And why did he do our show again if he was in New York?  Maybe he was just on a TV run this time.  Really?  Yeah.  He was more important than the Opie and Anthony show?  Probably.  For his career?  I don't think so.  He's trying to hit a diverse market.  And he was talking about GTL?  Yeah, because apparently he owns the trademark on it, which is really fucked.  Because Pauly D.  Yeah, there's other people.  I think Pauly D. on Jimmy Fallon said that he invented GTL, which is...  Not according to the courts. 
[01:28:30]  What?  Not according to the courts.  What?  Not according to the courts?  How do you know about the courts?  How do you know about the courts?  The trademark.  Oh.  So Situation owns it.  Said, fuck you, Pauly D.  I'm going to fucking copyright this and make a lot of money off it.  You can invent everything you want, but if you're not going to trademark anything, it's mine now.  Oh, man.  That's going to come to a head, huh?  And now there's GTL merchandise coming out and guess who owns it.  What's the GTL?  The gel?  No, gel is Jim Tan Laundry.  Oh, yeah, Jim.  Jim Tan Laundry.  It's what you do during the day.  Jim Tan Laundry and then you go out at night.  Jim Tan Laundry and then you go out at night. 
[01:29:00]  No one's going to buy GTL stuff.  Oh, yeah, they will.  Yeah, he talked about it on The View.  Here's the clip.  You trademarked GTL, Jim Tan Laundry.  That was smart.  And you put it on some merchandise.  Can you show it to us?  Yeah.  It's right behind you.  It's right behind you, Greg.  Yeah, this right here.  GTL Laundry Back.  And it does three things.  So, three things it does.  Right, right.  Okay, what does it do?  This is the official Jim Tan Laundry laundry bag.  And not only is it economically friendly, but you can technically use it as like a suit 
[01:29:30]  bag, okay?  Okay, so when you take it, you can use it as like a common bag.  You can use a suit bag as well as you can turn it over and go to, obviously, you know,  the laundry.  If you're a kid in college, you throw your laundry in here.  Okay.  Okay, you suit it back up like so.  And then you take it to the laundry.  Okay.  They're putting a laundry bag?  Technically, yeah.  Technically, yeah.  We can make fun all we want, but he'll probably make another million off this.  It's not him.  It's that dumb audience.  There are clappings.  Yeah, you open this, you throw your laundry in, you close it, and they're all like, oh, 
[01:30:00]  it's great.  It's just a laundry bag?  No, it's a suit bag.  And then you can turn it upside down, and it becomes a laundry bag.  You understand?  GTL.  Situation.  Jim Tan Laundry, Jersey Shore.  You see?  You watch Jersey Shore, Bill Burr?  Dude, I was actually at the taping of this, and I applauded wildly.  That's a great fucking, it's a great bag until an infant crawls in.  Gets his little face stuck in it.  How much money did he make last year? 
[01:30:30]  Five million.  Who?  Sitch.  Situation.  From Jersey Shore.  Oh, is that right?  Good for him.  Why not, right?  Yeah, good for him.  His orange abs.  They're all orange.  They love being orange.  How are you, Bill Burr?  I'm fantastic.  Heading to Atlantic City with Jim Norton.  Big show this weekend.  That's right.  I can't wait.  Everyone I'm talking to, they can't wait for this show.  Yeah.  What are you going down?  Yeah, I was going to talk to you guys about that.  I'm going to drive down Saturday, unless I was going to call Dave, see what he was doing. 
[01:31:00]  We should rent a Winnebago, Jimmy.  We can film and tell jokes all the way down.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do activities.  It's amazing how people think comedians just tell each other jokes.  Like, you guys must always...  It's like, we're funny around each other, but it's like, if one of us told, like, a joke  joke, like, all right, have you heard this one?  The other three would just spit on him.  It's just not the way it is.  No, not at all.  No, the only joke would be that you actually had the balls to try to tell a joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't even know how you do that.  Step forward and decide to tell a joke in front of other comedians. 
[01:31:30]  No.  It usually just becomes a bitch fest.  Yeah, you're a bitch about everything.  Yeah, yeah.  How was that?  It was fucking awful.  The promoter wanted me to do morning press, but there was nothing.  I did that.  I know that piece of shit.  That was terrible.  You guys actually are not a lot of fun to hang out with.  No, we're terrible.  We're terrible.  Not that I think about it.  When you're around us, you see the sadness that made us want to do that for a living.  Right, right.  This is what I find.  If it's you and one other comic, you'll probably end up having some deep conversation.  But if it's any more than two, you just start shitting on each other, or someone will just 
[01:32:00]  start bitching about a gig.  And that's it.  Yeah.  And then you just want to get the fuck out of there.  Yeah, or some hack that just made $5 million.  We all silently root against each other, even if we're friends.  Billy Crystal had a great quote about that, how we're all very happy for each other,  and we root against each other as comics.  You really root against each other?  But it's not a vindictive thing.  It's like somebody else's success is, in a way, a mirror of your failure. 
[01:32:30]  That's how we look at it, because we're self-centered.  It's not because we don't like other people.  Right, right.  You compete with whoever you started with.  Yes.  It's basically it.  So you're not happy if one of the guys that you started with kind of hits?  Jimmy, his wild success in this show has bothered me for about nine years.  Joking.  I'm joking.  No, no.  He actually looked at me like I was serious.  But, no, I wouldn't even be, like, guys like Louie and Colin are ahead of me.  Bill's my peer.  Bobby, Kelly.  Like, we're all in that same group. 
[01:33:00]  Colin and Bill are guys that are ahead of us.  They're like the classic, you know, Chris Rock's class of, he might even be ahead of them.  Yeah.  But guys that are ahead of you, you don't begrudge.  Yeah, like when Jimmy has a good day back east, I can feel it in my heart.  I don't even have to know.  I just feel it.  God damn it.  We send out vibes.  Jimmy booked something.  Well, you know, it wasn't an acting gig.  Yeah, you and me both.  It's fucking horrible, isn't it?  One of the quickest things you'll ever do is read my IMBD page. 
[01:33:30]  Whatever the hell you say it.  I still have, like, MTV Apartment 2F.  Did you do that?  I just saw my Apartment 2F set recently.  Did you really?  Oh, it was atrocious.  Yeah.  That was a really difficult gig.  The Sklar brothers had a show, and it was actually a really good idea.  They had this really cool thing, the way they would get the comedian on.  It was like, they lived in this apartment, 2F, and they ran a club.  And then, you know, every episode, they'd be down at their club, and a comedian would go on. 
[01:34:00]  Except that was the part of the show that was actually real.  You would actually perform to, like, these extras.  What does it feel like?  It's taken me two hours to explain this.  And then there was a studio audience.  So the weird thing was, you'd go up and you'd do your act.  Everybody would laugh, hopefully.  And then they'd go, okay, we're going to do it one more time.  Oh, fuck.  And I was going, I've got to do my act again, and everybody's going to see, you know, that the rabbit's already in the hat.  Yeah, that's horrible.  No, I actually switched it up on the second one.  And I thought I was being edgy.  I got a getting tested for AIDS bit, which was super edgy in the late 90s, you know, because I guess, you know, you probably shouldn't have talked about that. 
[01:34:30]  And I ate my balls on the second one, yeah.  That one they showed or no?  No, I didn't show that one.  I've got to be honest with you, I never had the courage to watch it because I felt the way you did when I went out.  I just watched it recently.  I had a bunch of my old stuff I was watching, like, from, like, 1993, like club tapes.  Galifianakis was in that show.  I didn't even realize that at the time.  Like, I just went back and saw a moment of it.  Like, Zach was a cast member of that show.  Was he on that? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he was really young then.  I mean, we all were a little younger.  You said something about acting, and I got to tell Bill I finally saw Date Night, and I know you've made fun of it and stuff.  That movie's so frustrating because...  No, I didn't trash that movie.  No, I'm making fun of it.  I was making fun of it, but I only had eight lines.  Dude, that's my only ray of light into ever doing another movie.  Yeah, I didn't mean it.  Please don't put me in that.  Yeah, I didn't mean it.  I didn't mean it that way.  Yeah, Bill, I heard the one thing on your IMDb, whatever, however the fuck you say it.  No, but that's what was so frustrating about the movie because they gave your partner there, the cop partner, all the lines. 
[01:35:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  She's an Oscar-nominated actress.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  I wanted to hear Bill Burr.  God bless you for plowing through that.  That's a friend.  No, I don't give a fuck.  Awards don't mean shit.  I'm holding on to this.  I wanted to fucking hear Bill Burr.  And it looked like, obviously, Bill should say something here.  And then she talked again.  Who was she?  And what did she not say?  What do you mean she won?  Did she win an Oscar or was she nominated? 
[01:36:00]  She was in...  I'm a sports guy.  She was in Benjamin Buttons.  She was.  She was the one who adopted the baby.  Oh, fuck yeah.  She was right there.  I didn't realize that was the same woman.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck you, Bill.  She's a great actress.  The second I was done with it, we were done with that, I went back to the funny bone in  St. Louis, and she immediately was going to China to go film another movie.  The new Karate Kid, the Will Smith one.  Oh, no shit.  Yeah, which ended up being another $100 million movie. 
[01:36:30]  I'm still going to say it, though, man.  I'm just like, let Bill talk.  I talked, but a lot of it got edited out.  I did.  When I had that Ray Liotta thing, we actually had some stuff where we went back.  The first couple times he trashed me, I was like, oh, my God, Ray's yelling at me, right?  And then I was just kind of like, wait a minute, I'm looking like an idiot here.  So then we went back and forth.  But, you know.  Did you find Ray to be a scary guy?  When he came in, I was extremely intimidated by him.  By Liotta?  And that rarely happens with me, but he was one of the guys I looked at. 
[01:37:00]  And he even during the interview, he called me out.  He goes, what's wrong with him?  Is he sick?  Because I was just sitting there like, I was intimidated.  I don't even know why.  But he's one of those guys.  Because you watch Goodfellas too many times.  Maybe.  You thought he was going to beat you with his gun butt.  He's so believable in Goodfellas.  But it's something about his eyes or something.  I have a short list of people that I get intimidated by when they come on the show.  He was definitely one.  I shut the fuck up.  I didn't think he was scary at all.  He was fine.  Yeah, we had a good time with the guy. 
[01:37:30]  But you didn't find him intimidating on set or anything?  No, he was...  Was he cool to you?  Yeah, very, like, just regular.  I'd be intimidated by a man.  But not regular, like boring.  Like regular, like he sounded like, you know, he just sounded like a guy from back east.  So that's why I kind of liked him.  I kind of liked him.  I was like, oh, I know this guy.  I think you have to be scared.  You're a good guy and you have the underlying anger.  I know this guy.  So, you know what I mean?  Okay.  I relate to this.  I grew up around this guy.  Maybe I recognize a little too much in his eyes. 
[01:38:00]  No, acting with Leota would be intimidating.  Like, that would scare me.  Like, doing a scene with him because...  Bill Burr did.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, that would be scary because that's his element.  Like, then you're walking to his fucking...  You know, doing this, you're just yapping.  But fucking...  Well, you got to do it right and there's a director and a camera.  I'd probably shit.  Well, I get him at like...  I'd call him Ray in the scene.  In the scene.  I really enjoyed Goodfellas.  Can we talk to you for a second?  No, I don't know.  There's a lot of intimidating things on that that I learned that, you know, you just got 
[01:38:30]  to block everything out.  If you're messing up, somebody's going to say something to you.  So, you know, when you see people whispering after takes, they're not talking about you.  That took me a while to learn that.  Like, I just immediately, this is the comic in my head.  I was like, they're saying I suck.  They're saying I suck.  I'm going to get fired.  Like, you start thinking like that.  But it's...  There's kind of like a...  You can't...  Like, if you have a suggestion on something, the reason why they're whispering is because  if you're wrong, you don't want to yell it out there and put it out to the people 
[01:39:00]  who are doing the scene.  So, you're supposed to just kind of whisper it to the director.  That's what you're supposed to do.  Or if it's something major business thing, like, yeah, they're cutting funding for the  movie.  Just like, you know, you're not going to yell stuff like that, which I guess doesn't happen  on big things like that.  But I learned...  I've learned that over the last, like, year and a half.  And nobody knows that you're...  Like, they might assume it, but it's almost like we think everybody knows what's going  on inside our heads, but they don't.  It's like sometimes you just have to act as if.  Like, if you just act like I belong here and this...  They have no idea. 
[01:39:30]  Like, they think, all right, this is the guy doing the scene with me.  If you can pull off that I belong here, how far you can get in the world.  Like, yeah, of course, yeah, I'm here.  Mobile office.  How are you?  We should take a break is what I'm thinking.  Because I just realized that Chris Russo is calling at 8.15.  And we want to try to do the idiot debate.  We got Stalker Patty.  And I want your take, of course, on the Jets Pats, Bill.  Bill just held up the paper.  We'll do it after the break.  I am fascinated.  You got a situation, though.  Game's at 4.30. 
[01:40:00]  The show starts at 8 down there in Atlantic City.  Yeah.  We'll have plenty of time.  That's how it works.  Yeah.  I think we'll wait a few minutes.  You'll be able to watch the game.  Well, I'm hosting, so I'm on first.  I want to make sure that the fucking game's over.  I'm sure Bill has a lot to say about this game, so we'll ask Bill about that next.  And we'll get into this gun debate with Stalker Patty and Nervous Oscar.  They're going to discuss gun control today.  Oh, okay.  So, stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest 
[01:40:30]  we couldn't get.  Drummer and friend of Conan O'Brien and Bruce Springsteen, Max Weinberg.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Max Weinberg.  Max, do you prefer Google or Bing?  The interweb.  That's right.  Ah.  I'll have to get back to you on that.  Thank you so much for your time. 
[01:41:00]  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the  Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Hanging with Bill Burr today.  Jim Norton, of course.  That's funny.  Big show going down in Atlantic City.  We're all going.  It's going to be a great weekend. 
[01:41:30]  And I have to horror the fact that I have tickets going on sale today, 10 a.m.  For the Montclair Wellmont Theater, March 5th at wellmonttheater.com.  Cool.  And I'll be whoring my new CD this weekend.  Very exciting.  Cap dancing and selling it.  The cover is terrific.  It's a great picture.  Yeah, it's called Despicable.  Yeah, it's my high school fucking sophomore photo.  I don't get a lesbian.  It's fucking horrid.  I like the picture of you and a young Jim Norton father.  Oh, it's on the CD. 
[01:42:00]  You and your father.  My dad looked good in that photo, right?  Yeah, he did.  He looks like he was a definite problem.  Like he didn't take anyone's shit.  Yeah, he was just a...  He wasn't a drinker at that time, but for all he had been.  Yeah.  You know.  He was just an ugly fuck.  Gosh, I'm awful.  A really homely boy.  Do you just study yourself in the mirror?  You don't have to.  You just look at a photo.  He doesn't know.  What the fuck was wrong?  Yeah.  He doesn't know.  My high school sophomore picture is, it's embarrassingly bad. 
[01:42:30]  Even in a comedic way, it's fucking horrid.  But everyone's picture was.  This picture...  Mine, I had the worst pizza face.  I don't even break it out ever.  The worst fucking acne.  I looked horrendous.  I had bright orange hair for like the first 13 years of my life.  There was no question of whether or not I was a freak.  At first day of like nursery school, I'm like, yeah, so my thoughts were correct.  I am one of the only ones.  So the red has toned down over the years, Bill.  Because it has with me, too. 
[01:43:00]  It got dark.  Yeah.  It started getting darker.  Yeah.  But I had just obnoxiously red hair growing up.  That's my fucking high school sophomore picture.  That's a nice shot, Jimmy.  Look at that.  It isn't that bad.  Oh, really?  Other than those big, awful glasses.  Those glasses are horrific.  That's Justin Bieber.  That's not bad.  Justin Bieber before Justin Bieber.  Nah.  Bill made me feel good.  Yeah.  It really isn't that bad.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You know what I like?  Your face is really toned, you know?  Yeah.  As opposed to the bloated mess it is now.  I can't believe I just, you know. 
[01:43:30]  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  I'm not hurt.  I am in the gym a lot more, though.  An hour a day on the elliptical.  Isn't that a pain in the ass?  Oh.  It gets boring.  Yeah, it's awful.  So.  But what's worse is seeing yourself nude.  That's worse.  I'm a bloated fuck.  I got to ask Bill Burr about the big game.  Yeah, man.  This is going to be.  Got the Jets and the Pats once again.  It's going to be an awesome game.  They won once.  We won once.  Who knows what's going to happen?  We all know what's going to happen.  But, nah.  I don't know, man.  All the Jets have to do.  Look. 
[01:44:00]  Everybody knows what's going to happen.  The Jets are going to try to get the running game going.  If they get that going, they're going to chew up the clock.  Brady's not on the field.  He can't hurt you if he's not on the field.  And the Patriots are going to do it.  They're going to try to take the running game away and put it on Sanchez's shoulder.  Hopefully you get up a couple scores.  Sanchez tries to make something happen.  Turns the ball over.  Yada, yada, yada.  So as far as all the trash talking that the Jets are doing, I don't understand how that helps you.  It's so dumb.  That's Rex Ryan's style. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know why.  I love it, but I hate it, being a Jets fan.  It's kind of nice to have a coach like that.  I know.  He's so confident.  Yeah, I love it.  He's just wildly confident.  There's no underlying insecurity there.  No.  But historically, well, you've seen the videos.  We'll play him again.  You've seen the videos, so of course there's some insecurities there.  Well, that guy, no, I was joking with my girl going, the only good thing about being a psycho,  the only positive thing is you can spot another psycho from across the room. 
[01:45:00]  And that dude is out of his mind.  All that trash talking he does, that has nothing to do with the game.  He's yelling at that voice in his head.  He needs a hug from his dad.  His dad can be, yes, you're a good defensive coordinator.  Granted, you didn't create the 46 defense, but yeah, you're a good guy.  Why is fucking from Marty?  Is that who was talking shit about the – he's like, what are you doing?  He wants Brady to throw it his way.  He's done nothing but win championships.  What are you fucking with him for?  He wants Brady to throw it his way a lot, not just a couple times. 
[01:45:30]  That never works.  Absolutely right.  It never works.  I've been saying all week, if this turns into a shootout, my team is fucked.  They've got to eat that fucking clock.  Yeah.  And what's the weather going to be like in Foxborough?  Do you know?  Horrific, hopefully.  But that doesn't affect Brady that much.  No, yeah, Brady plays great in bad weather.  Yeah.  So, yeah, like I have – you know, our defense, we're starting like four rookies.  You know what sucks about this is this is actually two really good teams,  but because of all the trash talk, now it's just – what I hate about it is if the Jets lose, 
[01:46:00]  it's going to be because of the trash talk, and then if they win,  it's going to be because of the trash talk, rather than like the stuff that I like,  the actual game.  But, I mean –  But that won't matter in the end if your team ends up winning.  You won't care about the trash talk two days later because you guys will be moving on to the next –  Yeah, but I'm – no, what I'm saying is just this whole – like it's been driving me nuts that they keep painting Rex Ryan out  like he's this confident guy.  Yeah.  It's just like, dude, that's like – it's like psych 101.  And you believe that he's like barely holding it together inside? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, my God, dude.  It's psych 101.  I can't argue that for you.  When he stands there – you know, when he went to go play us last time, and he's like, you know,  a lot of people think New England's the best team out there.  I'm not one of those guys.  And he gets – you know, and you see when the press laughs how his face lights up.  Like, fucking what's their – they like me.  They really like me.  He gets that look on his face.  Yeah, he's so good on it.  He's noticed he lost a ton of weight with that lap band surgery, and this is the level I watch sports.  Since that 45-3 loss, he stopped losing weight, and it looks like he's putting it on a little bit. 
[01:47:00]  So the level of M&Ms you have to be eating to reverse lap band procedure.  So you can talk all the shit you want.  When I see that Pelican chin coming back, I know –  That is – he's had a couple rough weeks.  He just wants Belichick to call him up and tell him that he thinks he's a good coach.  Belichick is a psycho, though.  Come on.  Oh, absolutely.  He's a lunatic.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not saying that he's not a psycho, but –  What's his issue, you think?  He's not – what is his?  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  I'm not that good.  He's – you've got to be like 10 years into – because he holds his cards all the way up to his vest.  You can't tell.  You can't tell what he's thinking.  He doesn't really show much emotion.  He's brilliant.  That's brilliant.  Even after he wins a Super Bowl, he only shows emotion for a quick minute or two.  The greatest thing I saw him do was the way they got rid of Randy Moss and the way they played it off.  Like, we don't want to do this, Randy.  Like, I was joking on my podcast that they got rid of Randy Moss, the way you get rid of, like, some psycho chick.  You just bring her out to a bar and introduce her to some other guy, and you just slowly back out of the room. 
[01:48:00]  You're beautiful.  You're awesome.  We'll see you later.  And watch it happen.  We think you're great.  We'll take a third-round draft pick.  See you later, Randy.  And just dumped him off.  Turned out to be the right move for them.  Yeah, no, because you've got to have everybody pulling the cart in the same direction.  What do you think of the Seahawks being able to be in the playoffs with a 7-9 record?  And then they get the home game against the Saints.  Which obviously means a shitload in the playoffs, and then they end up beating the Saints. 
[01:48:30]  That was the thing, though.  They ended up beating them.  So, I mean, I get that, you know.  But I just feel like if you're under .500, especially in football, I don't see why you should be allowed in the playoffs.  What about if your whole coaching staff is wearing Dockers?  That should be worth, like, half a loss.  Do you care, or is that a dumb thought on my part?  I cared a few years ago when we didn't make the playoffs, and then, like, the 8-8 Chargers got in.  But then they beat the Colts at home, so. 
[01:49:00]  But I think if you're 8-8, at least you're .500.  But to be 7-9 and you get a home game in the playoffs, it just seems like something is flawed.  Everybody knows 9-7 means wild card.  So, yeah.  So, if you're 8-8, win a division, that's annoying.  Like, 7-9 is, like, reprehensible.  And I understand why.  It was a very weak division and all that, but I don't know.  I think every year there's the Mafia game, you know what I mean, where the Mafia's just going to make all their goddamn money.  I think that that was the one.  That was the one.  Everybody's going to pick the Saints.  Drew Brees is going to come out there defending Super Bowl champions, and then they get their asses kicked. 
[01:49:30]  They get the Bears.  What do you think of the other games?  I know you're a huge Pets fan, and I'm a huge Jets fan.  But what do you think, Raven Steelers, real fast?  Oh, that one's a tough one.  It is, right?  You know what it is?  It's the Steelers just finally playing like how I thought they were going to play the whole year.  Palomalu's ridiculous.  Like, once a game, he, like, guesses the snap and jumps over.  And just destroys somebody.  Yeah, before the center, he barely even twitches his finger.  He's already landed on their quarterback.  Like some mountain lion. 
[01:50:00]  I have no idea.  It's in Pittsburgh?  Yeah.  And what is it this year?  Are they both one and one?  I don't know.  I don't know how that worked out.  Dude, all I'm focused on is this game.  I just need the Patriots to win.  I just, I really need, I need this one.  I hate how much I care about sports, but I really need them to win this game.  How many championships do they have?  They have three?  Patriots, yeah.  They have three.  Uh, and you like the Pats more than that.  And one huge loss.  Oh, right.  I forgot about the loss for the Giants.  Jesus Christ.  Do they ever get over that? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, you're over it.  When you win three, it's like the Yankee fans.  Have they won again?  Yankee fans, I mean, how much?  I haven't won since.  Once you win, 2001 was the most devastating loss ever.  As a Yankee fan, when they were down 2-0, won three straight,  then lost two in Arizona, which we all knew they would do  because of that cunt Randy Johnson.  That was a heartbreaker.  Once they win after that, you get over it.  Yeah.  If you're a fan of a successful team, like he didn't even bring up 2004,  where we won four games in a row.  That's like our unbelievable thing. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  But, you know, when you're sitting on 26 championships, it doesn't bite you.  But I think you've got to win one after the crushing defeat.  Yeah.  Didn't the Yankees lose an 0-4 to, I want to say Florida.  I've got to be honest with you.  Like, the fact that they lost was shocking, but, like, that was one of the most overrated.  I mean, we played the Giants the last game of the year that year,  and the final score was like 37-35.  And then three weeks later, we're 17-point favorites.  Right.  I didn't, you know, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  If we lost a regular season game and all that shitstorm went away as far as, like,  are they going to go undefeated, I think we would have had a much better chance.  In a weird way, they needed to just lose a game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And fuck the 72 Dolphins when they won 14 in a row when there was, like, you know, two channels.  And, like, sports was just that five-minute guy at the end of the telecast going,  oh, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 120-something, 10-leads, rattling off the sports.  Vancouver plays later on tonight at 12.  There was no pressure is what you're saying. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, there was none of that.  Yeah, you could, like, bang hookers.  It wasn't around-the-clock sports.  There wasn't cell phone cameras.  Just focusing on you and the fact you haven't lost the game yet.  Yeah, cell phone cameras, none of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, where's Stalker Patty and Oscar?  We should get into the gun debate.  We're going to talk more about sports with Russo.  What time is he calling?  He was supposed to call, but he's got to get his kids to school.  Okay.  We'll call in around 845, I guess.  You following?  The Bruins doing well this year, I guess?  Yeah, we're all right.  We had a brutal loss to the Canadians the other day, but then we beat the Penguins.  We beat, I think we beat the Flyers last night. 
[01:52:30]  Somebody gave me a text, but I've been so busy running around.  You like hockey more than football?  I forget.  It's pretty much even.  Close, right?  Pretty much.  That's what I thought.  That 24-7, though, with the Penguins.  I loved it.  How funny was it?  Fucking loved it.  How funny was the end of that game?  The Winter Classic?  Yeah, when there's like a second and a half left, and they're pushing each other, and the  ref's trying to get control.  Just drop the fucking puck.  It doesn't even matter.  He's going, come on, settle down, settle down. 
[01:53:00]  And they're all yelling his name, whatever.  Just drop the fucking puck, Pierre.  Drop the fucking puck.  HBO really helped along this rivalry to make the two teams absolutely hate each other.  The game is out of touch.  The Capitals are going to win the Winter Classic, right, Jim?  And there's, what, a 1.1 second or something like that?  Yeah, all he's got to do is drop the puck.  The Penguins want to skate off because they lost and they're pissed.  The game is over, and he's trying to get control of the ice, and these guys just want  to beat the shit out of each other.  Yeah.  And he won't drop the puck.  The ref?  Yeah, he won't drop it. 
[01:53:30]  He wants it.  Because he wanted everyone to be under control.  It's like, fuck that.  Drop the puck and let the time run out.  Because then if they start fighting and shit, there's problems.  Oh, it was the...  I love the 24-7.  This is something I said years ago when I first started seeing, you know, listening to  audio when they would mic up a player saying that they should have, like, some sort of  NC-17 sports package.  Right.  Where they have all the players mic'd up, and you can listen to what they say.  Because a lot of it is what you'd think they'd be saying, and then there's just random,  hilarious shit that they say.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  I would love to hear it.  I'm so bummed it was only, what, four weeks, I guess?  24-7 pens versus caps.  Went by way too quick.  Yeah.  That should have been at least eight or ten weeks of that.  I ended up...  They kill me when I say this, but I ended up kind of liking Crosby after that.  Did you?  Yeah.  He came across like more of a regular guy and not such a baby like we've all heard over  the years.  That was the worst thing that ever, with, like, free agency, and all the players bonded  against the owners.  That's what killed so many rivalries, because then you hung out with the other person, you 
[01:54:30]  know?  Right.  Yeah, you know, he's not that bad.  Yeah, I kind of ended up liking Crosby and the Penguins in general.  Yeah, like, I would hate Derek Jeter if I just always lived in Boston.  But when I came down here, and I actually was able to, you know, see them every night, and  then see interviews of him where it wasn't from a Boston perspective.  Right.  He's like, yeah, you know, he's kind of a great player.  I'm not a Penguins fan, but I don't have a team right now.  My fucking Islanders have been out of it for two months.  It's every year. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, but at least every year they make it look good, you know, at this point in the season.  In November, I knew they didn't have a shot at the playoffs.  They have, like, that reverse trajectory where they came out of the gates as an expansion  franchise, and they should...  What they're doing now...  They should have done back then.  And somehow they went right up...  Yeah, they won...  I'm frustrated, because I love hockey big time, and I just...  I'm lost.  Yeah, I know they lost last night.  I'm still taking a peek, but I'm not really watching the games. 
[01:55:30]  Is anybody aware there's a very sexy lady in the room?  Hi, Stalker Patty.  A very sexy lady is walking the room.  You're looking like a grandma.  What the fuck?  Isn't she?  No.  You're right, Patty.  Are you sick?  I like her rock star boots.  Yes.  You sick, Patty?  No.  I'm just nervous.  What does your sweater say?  I don't even...  Who cares if there's a big coffee stain on the white thing?  It's fine.  That's it.  Pucks.  Wait, I'll let her try.  You don't know what is written on your own sweater. 
[01:56:00]  No, I don't pay attention to that.  I just put it on.  I like that.  It's a Hollister sweater.  Oh, it's Hollister?  Yeah.  What's that little shade of the demographic?  It's a hostel.  She stayed there last night and they gave her a sweater.  Travis just had a very funny Hollister joke, I'm telling you right now.  What did you say?  Well, Hollister is for the kids.  Let's look at their catalog here.  Hollister is for the kids, and Patty's wearing one of the kids' sweaters.  I like the fact that you have rock salt all over your boots.  You're a mess today, Patty. 
[01:56:30]  I don't care as long as I'm warm.  That a girl.  All right, you're going to debate gun control.  Yeah, this is the type of people or girls they want shopping at Hollister.  Very young.  Well, I can't help my age.  Worst sound ever.  That clear of the throat.  You've been all right, Patty?  How were the holidays?  Good?  Yeah, very good.  Friends and everything.  I was in one friend's house on New Year's Christmas Eve and another friend's house on Christmas 
[01:57:00]  Day, and I'm going to another friend's house tonight to visit him and their family.  Right, right.  I didn't really need to know all that.  I just needed to know it was okay.  It more sounds like, why don't you take it tonight?  Yeah.  I really want to see you.  Where's Oscar?  He's ready.  Nervous Oscar.  Have you ever met Nervous Oscar, Bill?  No, I haven't.  It's a fucking mess.  I've never met a person named Oscar.  No?  You're not missing anything.  I just feel like Oscar Madison, Oscar the Grouch, Oscar Gamble. 
[01:57:30]  Oscar Gamble, there you go.  That's a good one.  The greatest Afro ever to be in sports.  Oscar Robinson.  Oscar Robinson, sure.  Yeah, that's before my time.  Yes, sir.  Oscar just told me that he's nervous today and he never gets nervous.  He said that?  Yes.  All right, bring him in so Bill Burke can meet him.  Oscar!  You know what's good?  Yeah, when you clear your throat, if you could just turn your head even more into the mic,  that would be perfect.  Good morning. 
[01:58:00]  This is Oscar, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, how are you?  I'm pretty good, man.  How you doing?  Are you auditioning for the voice of a cartoon character?  Hey there, Yogi!  How you guys doing?  You got a nice shirt on yourself.  Oh, thank you.  Just ask her.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a lesbian thing.  I don't know if it's...  Are you Canadian?  No, no, I'm Colombian.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He definitely had that not-within-the-border voice.  Oh, yeah, nervous.  Sam's telling me you're nervous today, Nervous Oscar. 
[01:58:30]  I didn't know...  Yeah, I mean...  Your name is Nervous Oscar on the show, and you're trying to tell Sam you've never been  nervous before until today.  Well, fuck yeah, well...  You don't know why you're nervous?  I don't know, man.  Can I venture a guess?  Because you're going to debate something and you're a blithering idiot.  Well, I...  Well, yeah.  Well, it's like this, man.  I mean, I raked up a couple of...  What do you call it?  Statistics and shit like that.  But fuck it.  I mean, I don't...  Yeah.  Evan, what are you doing now? 
[01:59:00]  Who goes first?  No.  That doesn't...  That's a point.  Oscar, we were talking football.  You care about the football games this weekend?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, yeah.  I'll just get drunk at the bar and watch a couple of games.  Who's your team?  Well, I guess I'm going to stick to the Jets for this weekend.  See what happens.  Most of my friends are Jets fans, so...  I've been drinking for like two weeks straight, man, so...  It's a little jittery.  That's all.  Oh, because I have nothing to do, you know what I'm saying, with the house.  Oh, I do work in the morning, so...  What the fuck about...  Anyways. 
[01:59:30]  That's good.  Fuck.  He's easy.  All you got to do is just stare at him, and he just sort of...  Yeah, he just collapses.  We're just listening to you, Oscar.  Yeah.  You know, just to bring something up, a few years back, I sent you a message on MySpace.  Yeah, and then you replied.  You were cool about it.  I went to Bananas the one weekend.  It was probably five years, six years ago.  I'm not on...  I was never on MySpace.  No, yes, you were.  No.  Oh, maybe somebody pretending to be you, maybe.  Or a different college.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, I was never you.  Yeah.  But, I mean, that weekend, I was on horse tranquilizers, so... 
[02:00:00]  I mean, tranquilizers.  Animals.  Blue boy.  Yeah.  You ever done that stuff?  No.  Wait, what?  No, no.  It's a...  Yo, it was a friend of mine.  He went and gave me this little bottle.  So, every time, you know, to chill out, just, you know, sniff this thing, and it'll just  melt you out.  Yeah.  But it was like a little...  It said animal tranquilizer in the back.  Yeah.  Well, it's not like ether, I don't think.  But anyway, so what happens is you take a sniff of that, right?  And for like 20 seconds, you don't hear anything.  Well, here's your heartbeat.  Go like, boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[02:00:30]  And you just...  So now...  This is what my first stand-up set sounded like.  Oh, shit, man.  I'm flattered.  You just keep plowing ahead.  Oh, oh, here's another one.  Are you worried?  My dad was crazy.  Oh, shit.  Are you worried about the tranquilizers?  Oh, no, no.  Not at all.  You don't think you'll drop dead from that shit?  No, I'm still alive.  And how often do you do...  I don't know.  I was back in the day, you know, with drug days.  Yeah.  Yeah, but not anymore.  I don't do that shit. 
[02:01:00]  I just drink.  And a little...  No, no.  Oh, actually, fuck.  This morning, I had a horrible nosebleed.  And I'm like, wait a second.  And I'm like, no, but it can't be because of that.  So I was like, I wonder what...  Maybe it was the dryness in the room.  Because from the...  What do you call it?  The venting system in the house.  You know, keep the house warm.  Heat.  Yeah, the heat.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah.  Anyways.  What are you guys doing?  That was like $10,000 pyramid.  Yes.  The vent, the warming thing.  Heat.  Heat.  Things a junkie says. 
[02:01:30]  $2,500.  Awesome.  You couldn't come up with the word heat.  Yeah, I just...  I blacked out.  I mean, yeah, I mean...  So it wasn't from this?  No, no, it wasn't from that.  Yeah.  Hell no.  I've been drinking Molson, Canadian, like a lot.  Fucking lately.  Why are you drinking a lot?  Just because you're bored and...  I said he was Canadian.  Yeah, yeah.  You're bored and you just don't have a job, so...  Oh, no, I do have a job.  It's just, what happened?  I'll get home and they're like...  Oh, tell Bill what you do.  Just so Bill knows you a little bit.  Oh, okay.  Before the debate.  Before the debate.  Well, Bill, I'm a Montclair State University student. 
[02:02:00]  This will be my senior year.  My last semester, I work for a little retail store.  And I sell shit.  People come in with problems and I fix it.  That's what I do.  Yeah, but especially...  I mean, travel wear.  Like, luggage and shit like that.  Fucking, yeah.  I take care of people.  I have a business card if you need one.  I don't need any help with anything.  You need a business card from Oscar?  No, I'm good.  Your luggage is good.  He's good with the luggage.  He actually sold Henry Lee Lucas in the suitcase and carried his friend in. 
[02:02:30]  Yes.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Freep.  Okay.  Woo!  And he drinks on the job, too.  He admitted that last time, right?  Oh, well, after work.  Yeah.  But it's still, I mean, yeah.  It's work.  Not during...  Well, I...  It's sort of during work, but you got your work day done, right?  Yeah.  I got shit done, man.  How do you spell the word well?  Well?  Yeah.  You keep saying wool.  Oh.  Well.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  I know, man.  It's...  I don't know, man.  It's just shit comes up and, you know, fucking blurry. 
[02:03:00]  I'm going to have Tourette's, actually.  No, you don't.  No?  No?  Okay.  No, it's...  It's...  It's horse tranquilizers.  Oh!  Cute alcoholism.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't, man.  It might be a little fucking cocaine mix.  No, no, no.  No, I don't swing that way anymore.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Hell yeah.  So, um...  Okay, we're going to debate guns.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, I'm here to...  We're here to discuss the pros and cons.  I'm against gun control and peace for art. 
[02:03:30]  What are you doing?  All right.  That's an opening statement.  We're going to spice it up.  Oh, I got...  That sounds like every class I failed.  Today class, we're here to discuss.  We got this for everybody.  Live from the McGraw Hill Building in New York City, it's the Opie and Anthony idiot debate.  Tonight's debate, gun control.  Gun control.  Arguing for gun control.  A former Opie and Anthony intern whose enthusiasm for women, beer, and partial sentences can only be matched by his passion for nonviolence. 
[02:04:00]  It's Oscar.  And arguing against gun control, she's as conservative in her political views as she is with her pussy and anus.  The vivacious Starbucks barista, stalker Patty.  And now, your moderators for this battle of twits.  All right.  It's going to be terrific. 
[02:04:30]  So who starts with their opening statement?  I guess Patty, because she decided.  That's good.  Okay.  I have some statistics backing up.  No, no, no.  You've got to start over.  And they should have 60 seconds.  They should have 60 seconds.  I'm Patty, and explain your, you know, are you for it?  Okay.  My name is Patty.  I'm against the draconian laws regarding gun control.  And have found that statistically speaking, it is safe to own a gun. 
[02:05:00]  And that the fears that people have are greatly exaggerated.  45 more seconds.  Okay.  And this is the opening statement.  Don't go to your facts.  Okay.  No.  No, you've got 45 more seconds.  This is you, Patty.  So if you have to, just keep reiterating and just say the same horseshit over and over again.  Well, I uncovered some statistics that prove, according to actual people's studies,  that there is less incidence of killing from guns than people actually believe. 
[02:05:30]  And that there are more incidence from other causes.  And that the states, with the loosest forms of gun control, where owning a gun is very easy to do.  That's time.  That's time.  That's time.  That's it?  That's time.  All right.  Good.  There's Oscar, your opening statement.  Well, hello, everybody.  I'm going to start off.  Oscar.  Okay.  Oh, here we go.  Awesome. 
[02:06:00]  Cool.  I'm going to, I mean, the United States, we understand that it's built on tradition.  Oscar.  Cool.  Awesome.  That's awesome.  You're all pretty cool.  Anyways, so we're back.  All right.  In the United States, we know we built on tradition.  Oh, what's up?  That's it?  Come on.  I didn't even.  Okay.  Okay.  It's built on tradition.  I know.  Passion, constitutional, right.  There we go.  Go ahead, Oscar.  Do you know about it?  I'll do it for real.  No, I'm just going to salvage common ground.  I do understand that guns here, it's traditional. 
[02:06:30]  It is constitutional, but I think we're past that.  This is a new age, and I think we have to fix problems now so that our kids can live in a safer world.  Thank you.  You still have more time.  Oh, more time.  Okay, cool.  So, um.  For the opening statement.  Don't give your.  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, no statement.  Um.  Um.  I just.  I want my kids to live in a safe world.  So that's why I'm here.  Um.  Supporting gun control.  I mean.  You got like 40 seconds.  40 seconds.  What?  That was like.  Okay.  Probably, um. 
[02:07:00]  Damn.  It's like.  Um.  Let's see.  What else?  Um.  For this.  Oh, the kids hang a little good.  What's up?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And.  Oscar.  Awesome.  Oh, I like that.  I'm getting a puppy next week.  I want my puppy to live in a group world.  Two.  That's why.  Actually, stupid.  I don't know why I brought that up.  Anyways.  Um.  Traditional.  Okay, that's time.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  Thank God.  Okay.  What?  You don't like this, Jimmy?  No, I just keep thinking of a fucking car tire going over that dog's head.  And how much happier it will be. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  There is a myth that guns are dangerous when used for protection.  We didn't notice that much of any rules.  What are the rules?  But the U.S. justice is plowing through.  Stop plowing through.  We'll get to you.  Stalker Patty.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  What are the rules of the idiot debate?  I believe Patty should have one minute to make a point, and then Oscar should get a  30-second rebuttal.  I like that.  Okay.  All right.  Patty, what is your first point? 
[02:08:00]  The first point is.  Stalker Patty.  Guns are dangerous when used for protection.  However, the U.S. Bureau of Justice statistics show that they're the safest, most effective  means of defense, and they result in fewer injuries to the defender than any other means  of protection, and it's safer than not resisting at all.  There are 80 million gun owners in the U.S.  There are 700,000 doctors.  For all those 80 million people, only 1,500 occurred in an accidental death. 
[02:08:30]  But out of 700,000 doctors, 120,000 ended up in accidents with 171 dead.  So there's a higher rate of doctors and hospitals killing you than a gun.  And not only that, but England and Canada have the most draconian gun control laws in  the world.  And no citizen can carry a gun, but their home invasions are four times more. 
[02:09:00]  Stalker.  Some good goddamn points.  Yeah, it really is some good points.  I like the fact that you mention something, like doctors, they always go for a really weird  example.  Yeah.  Like, you know, you're more likely to be killed by a yak.  A soda machine.  That was so weird.  No, and soda machines never fall on anybody.  It happened once.  Oh, yeah, that's like that cigarette commercial where they talk about how a black mamba, one  bite can kill a person, but cigarettes kill more people than a black mamba.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, all those fucking... 
[02:09:30]  How many people are hiking in the...  In the middle of Australia.  Is that where you have to go?  I don't even know where.  You don't buy a box of black mambas.  I don't know where the black mambas hang on.  It's going to be destroyed, can kill the entire universe.  I was going to go with the Mojave Desert, was my answer to where they live.  Oscar, now you've got to rebut that point.  Some good knowledge coming out of Patty there.  30 seconds.  Well, I see...  Oscar.  He can't start a sentence without wealth.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  All right, well, Pat, I see what you're saying, but you, unfortunately, I mean, it's just 
[02:10:00]  numbers and you're throwing figures out there.  You're trying to make this point all elaborately interesting with all this stuff.  You know, what you're...  But what I'm saying, let me ask you something.  How many films have you seen with Chuck Norris when he didn't have a gun and he still kicked  ass?  I don't really watch films.  Okay, what about Burt Reynolds?  Burt Reynolds?  Yeah, I remember shows from the 60s. 
[02:10:30]  Exactly.  You need ninja skills.  You don't need a gun.  Somebody comes out in the alley, you just, you go, you just whoop the freaking gun off  the hand and just kick ass.  That's what you do.  That's self-defense right there.  You don't need guns.  Actually, there's a very low incidence of death regarding guns and only 1% of guns are  criminally used.  Well, let me tell you about a story about old people and why they should not have guns  for self-defense purposes.  Check it out.  This old guy I know is a friend of a friend, fucking 89 years old, goes, somebody gave 
[02:11:00]  him a puppy, goes take him for a walk, tangles on the little fucking leash, goes, hits the  freaking ground, breaks his freaking head open, takes him to the hospital, died two days  later.  Can you imagine if that guy had a gun?  He could have killed that fucking puppy.  Oscar!  Yeah!  Okay.  That's the rebuttal.  Now what?  Nervous Oscar makes...  Now Oscar gets to make a one-minute point. 
[02:11:30]  That was great to mention two guys that haven't done like a relevant movie since 1988.  I know.  So, you know, come on, Sharky Machine.  I like when she said, I don't watch movies and then he names movie stars.  Yeah, Burt Reynolds.  Burt Lancaster.  Patty, you don't watch movies at all?  What was the last movie you saw?  Well, first of all, I have to rent my movies because I don't have TV right now.  So I go to Blockbuster Video and I watch Human Interest and Drama.  Wait, how do you watch them?  You don't want to bring them home and hold them up in front of the lights? 
[02:12:00]  I have a DVD player I got as a present from somebody for my birthday.  Human Interest and Drama section.  Yeah, where is that?  Is that Human Interest slash Drama?  Well, right now I'm into the history of England.  I'm watching all the Queen Elizabeth movies.  Oh, no.  Anything but.  They're really good movies.  They're not good movies.  Well, I...  Why not like a movie movie?  What was the last movie movie you went to? 
[02:12:30]  The Passion.  Oh, The Christ?  Yeah.  I could never watch that a second time.  Why?  Why?  Are we getting a little damp?  Because it was kind of sad.  But it does depict what they think is realistic.  They got their shit beat out of them for an hour and a half.  Yeah, well, they depict that as more realistic than what the pretty...  That was six years ago, Patty.  I know.  You haven't been to a movie in six years?  Yeah.  I didn't know this about Patty after all these years.  She doesn't go to movies.  Oh, actually, the last movie I went to was Benjamin Button. 
[02:13:00]  Did you?  Yes.  And I've seen that movie about five times.  Did you play the part of the baby?  Very funny.  Well, that's why I said it.  Yeah.  All right, Oscar, it's time to make some kind of point.  All right, cool.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, you go.  All right, cool.  All right, so...  Oh, Oscar.  All righty.  So, I know that some people use guns for recreational purpose.  Go out hunting, right?  So, I mean, yeah, it is fun fucking shooting a gun and feeling that power between your hands. 
[02:13:30]  But, like, my hunting, I do it at the supermarket.  I go down there.  I don't have to go kill a freaking cow with a gun.  I have my steak there, and I get whatever I need, and I get freaking reward points at the A&P with my little swipe card.  Actually, no.  It's ShopRite.  Ah, fuck.  It doesn't matter.  Anyways, so, yeah, that was my point.  So, you don't need guns to go out hunting.  I mean, you get your food at the supermarket, right?  Let's see.  Yeah, so...  What?  Anyways, no, that was a good point, right?  Valid?  No? 
[02:14:00]  Well, then how other people...  Someone has to kill the cow.  Yeah, but they use a freaking...  They don't show up and hang themselves.  Oh, shit.  Actually, I have a fucking friend of mine.  He was at a slaughterhouse.  Fucking guy fell over.  Got electrocuted right in the fucking spot, man.  Got fucking...  Yeah, well, they use electrocution as a method of...  And then they cut open the throat.  Oh, actually, I was Faces of Death.  Have you guys seen that?  Faces of Death?  No?  Yeah.  Have you seen that?  No.  Fucking...  Yeah.  They go, they put the cow through the fucking thing. 
[02:14:30]  I think I'm watching a scene from it right now.  Yeah.  Wait, so...  Fucking scary.  What about the people that go to ranges and shoot at targets and...  Oh, it's fun.  I mean, yeah, absolutely.  I mean, no, no.  Well, okay.  Okay, let's, for instance, let's see if, um...  We see, people are clumsy sometimes, man.  They could, you know...  Did you make a point?  Did I?  No.  He didn't.  Oh, fuck.  Summarize your point so Patty has something to go with.  Oh, okay, all right.  All right, check it out.  Fucking having guns is like having a large... 
[02:15:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, that one?  All right, cool.  Well, see, owning guns is dangerous.  It's like having a huge penis.  You could really cost somebody some damage.  Actually, I was just doing research.  You know, they have like vaginal surgical procedures that, you know, they can stitch you back up in case, you know, it's a little too loose.  And, uh, yeah.  Anyways, well, what were you saying?  All right, Patty.  Yeah, yeah, go.  I want to rebut that.  Yeah.  Okay, in regard to hunting, you have to control animal populations in the United States that might be running rampant, like deer. 
[02:15:30]  That's why they declare a hunting season, to control the animal population, or they'll spread disease and get into your yards and eat your crops, you know?  That's one thing.  And the second thing is, with Washington, D.C., with guns being danger, and they have the draconian control over there, for every 227 people out of 100,000, that's how many people get killed by guns. 
[02:16:00]  It's 20 times the national average.  So if gun was so controlled over there, why is their murder rate more than 20 times the national U.S.? 
[02:16:30]  ...savage.  In the U.S. as a whole, homicidal rates are only 7 per 100,000.  And the states with the loosest gun control have the lowest rate of killings with guns.  With North Dakota, only 1.1%.  Maine, only 1.2% of the population.  South Dakota, only 1.7%. 
[02:17:00]  I see what you're trying to say.  Very low.  He's killing them.  Wait a second.  All right.  You're in a dark alley.  Somebody puts out a gun, and that rapist has a huge penis.  What do you do?  Those guys are...  And besides, you didn't even answer anything about my comment on the big penis.  Hey, you guys...  We're not discussing penises here.  That was the example we used.  This is a debate.  We're supposed to...  Yeah, you didn't mention the big penis.  Well, only 1% of American gun stock is used criminally, and those are stolen. 
[02:17:30]  And on the black market, and you take that out of the population, the incident in the United States is very low.  And guns don't cause death.  There's no reason to shout, Patty.  It's poverty.  It's lack of family function in the home.  Those cause problems, not the guns themselves.  Oscar, you're getting your ass kicked.  Let's go.  He's killing you.  You got to freestyle at this point.  Fuck your papers.  Freestyle.  What do you got? 
[02:18:00]  All right.  Let it flow, man.  Let it flow.  Let's go.  We're nearing the end of the debate, and she's kicking your ass with stats.  Well, you know, it's hard for me.  I don't like...  She was talking, but I was just listening to what she was saying.  But it's a debate.  You got to listen.  No, no.  I know.  Well, it's just numbers.  They're numbers that have been proven.  Proven?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you're a Ph.D. or something, or what?  No.  I have names.  Well, you certainly have the charisma of a...  Yeah, well, Joshua McCracken did a study. 
[02:18:30]  Freaking boring doctor.  And he's the one that found out about the 80 million gun owners compared to 700,000 doctors.  Who found that out?  What was the name of the person?  Joshua McCracken has been cited for that.  He did a study on that.  Joshua McCracken.  Marble columns.  And not only that, but in 1994, they had...  Wait, so if you had a gun right now, and I attacked you, you would be able to use that 
[02:19:00]  weapon efficiently?  And would you have the balls to just go and kill me right now if I went to attack you, huh?  If you attacked me, there would be...  First of all, it would be used as a last resort.  And if anything else fails...  Oh, if I'm horny and I'm a rapist, I'll...  You're going to keep walking.  Which is not what happened either.  Do you know Florida issued 188,106 licenses in 94?  You know how many innocent people were killed and injured? 
[02:19:30]  I don't believe it.  And the odds were calculated that there's only one out of 26,000...  Can you use a gun at Starbucks?  That's a gun who was killing an innocent person.  Starbucks, do you need to use a gun?  What if somebody comes in and...  Oh, fuck.  It's going the wrong way.  Fuck.  Ah, shit.  You know, the FBI has said that...  Did you just change sides?  Yeah, I know what I did.  Fuck.  FBI data has proven...  Homicidal rates have been declining for decades.  You've got to wrap up there, Oscar.  Okay.  What do you think? 
[02:20:00]  God, that voice.  Everything she's saying, you've got...  Don't say a word, Patty.  Let Oscar try to come up with something here as sort of a final statement thing.  All right.  Well, I'm going to refer to this movie, Fast Times at Richmond High.  You saw the last scene where...  What's the guy?  He throws the coffee pot.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Marv.  Anson Williams.  Yep.  All right.  And then Sean Penn comes out of the bathroom.  He's like, awesome, right? 
[02:20:30]  He used the coffee pot.  See?  You didn't have a gun.  It's only a movie.  And a script.  And imagination.  Haven't you learned anything from what I said?  It's not a human interest or drama.  Right.  All righty.  Here, hear me this out.  When I was 17, I was at this bar, right?  It was a very good year.  All righty.  I was...  Somebody pulls out a gun and shuts it in the air and kills this little girl. 
[02:21:00]  In a bar?  Yeah, yeah.  She was holding the cat.  Well, how did he kill her in the air?  Was she on the fucking ceiling?  No, the club was...  The cat in the bar.  The clubs was outside.  It was outside.  We were outside the bar.  Club.  So, what happened was that the gun fired and kills the cat and the girl.  I don't care about the cats because I don't like cats.  But, I mean, think about that little girl.  Wait, it fired it in the air?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, she was on the second floor.  Anyways, what would you say to that little girl?  Get a basement apartment. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's funny.  Patty?  Well, first of all, the incident of that happening is very low.  And second of all, it's unfortunate that that happened.  How do you know that?  You're like Superman.  You're going to be there to prevent this?  What country was this in?  What?  What country was this in?  Oh, it was in Long Island.  Long Island?  Yeah.  We've got to wrap up this mess.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck.  Patty, final statement. 
[02:22:00]  All I could say is that owning a gun is not the cause of crime in America.  It's the people.  It's the person that's behind the gun.  When you check for gun ownership in an application, the rules are very stringent.  You know, that guy that shot those people over there, you know.  It was very specific.  Well, he actually walked into a store, and they did not do their job and check.  If they had seen his mental illness, that would have deterred him from getting a gun in the first place. 
[02:22:30]  I heard they did check, but it didn't come up on his record.  Then he withheld information, which is also against the law, and they found that out later.  Yeah, I know.  I was just correcting you.  And that's one of the points when you're applying for a gun, you cannot withhold information.  Well, most psychos are law-biting, which is nice.  In this case, he wasn't.  How come you have such big hands?  I didn't realize what big mitts you had.  Me?  Stargapack?  Yeah.  Big man hands.  Well, I got piano hands.  That's what they call me.  Oh, really?  You play the piano? 
[02:23:00]  Piano hands?  Just by ear, not that well.  Oh, wow.  Awesome.  All right, and Oscar, just to wrap it up, your final statement.  How could none of us have anything funny from piano hands?  We all just sat there and let it lighten.  I don't know.  All right, 24% of all violent crimes, people have used guns, right?  You take those guns from the street, that's 24% less.  There you go.  There we go.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Nervous Oscar and Stalker Patty.  Our first Idiots Debate. 
[02:23:30]  Did that go well to me?  I would say that Patty wiped the floor with him.  Yeah, Oscar.  She's disappointed.  She massacred you.  Well, there's no charisma.  I didn't see charisma.  No, she's a fucking complete dud.  Wait, charisma wants the bigs.  She's a fucking seashell, but it doesn't matter.  She ate you alive, man.  She came at you with her fucking horrible voice and facts.  And you argued with an operator.  Well, I have to be honest.  Every time I try to do, like, freaking research on this, I was doing it when I was drunk, so I would just lose interest and skip right to the porn site. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, that's why.  All right.  I will admit, you know, I was kind of semi-prepared.  You were completely unprepared.  Yeah, cool.  Patty and her little fucking herpes sore on her lip were 100% prepared.  It took me three days to prepare this.  Jesus.  I spent about four hours.  It's a dumb bit to kill ten minutes.  What are you doing?  She cared about it.  She was good.  No, Patty.  She was very good.  Patty had some knowledge, whether you agree or disagree.  She was well-researched.  Excellent job, Patty.  All right, Patty.  We will talk to you after Stacey Keach. 
[02:24:30]  We've got to take a break.  Stacey Keach will be on the show next.  Is he here?  I believe so.  And then a little later, hopefully Chris Russo, if he's done dropping off his kids.  Bill Burr is here.  Are you promoting anything else, Bill, besides not the AC show?  I have a gig in Tarrytown and one out in Jersey at the Count Basie Theater.  Where do they go?  Bill Burr.com?  February.  You know what?  That'll be our teaser for after the break.  All right.  Go to Bill Burr's website.  Bill Burr.com, right? 
[02:25:00]  February 18th.  I'm going to be at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey.  And I know I have one in Tarrytown.  Oh, on the 17th, the Tarrytown Music Hall.  Tarrytown, New York.  And, of course, the Monday Morning Podcast, which a lot of people are loving.  Yeah, the Monday Morning Podcast.  You having fun doing that?  Oh, yeah.  I'm having a great time.  Awesome.  More with Bill Burr.  Stay there.  Are you looking for that perfect gift?  Well, look no further.  Introducing the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  It's unbelievable.  This four-disc DVD box set, personally narrated by the famous self-deprecating comedian, 
[02:25:30]  will show you some of the most notorious places to pick up women in one of the most dangerous cities in New Jersey.  If I could, all I would do is rape jokes right now.  In this video, you'll learn how to properly approach a prostitute.  It's easy.  They do recognize you after a while.  They'll heckle you.  They'll yell things.  They keep riding around.  Hookers never like Sabbath.  I learned that.  I would only pick them up if they got it on the right side.  I would stop.  Shit like that.  How to avoid awkward situations when dealing with a hooker.  I remember one Puerto Rican chick got in my car and she was eating peanut brittle.  She sucked my dick and it was in all that peanut smell. 
[02:26:00]  I was looking at hookers.  And I stopped and the tranny walked over and snatched my glasses off and said,  For wasting my time!  I actually high-beamed and flashed the cop.  And I'm like, she took my glasses.  I'll never forget it as long as I live.  And most importantly, how to spot a fake.  A lot of times people get fooled, man.  I never realized that a fucking guy would get tits.  It didn't occur to me.  I was getting hookers for a long time at that point.  We were fucking and it was pitch black in my car in Jersey City.  I knew.  Well, when I discovered that the lady was not quite the lady, I thought,  it's like, what am I going to do, talk to her manager?  I fucking dumped my load. 
[02:26:30]  So don't be caught off guard and take this advice from someone who's been there time and time again.  I should be fucking the mouth for the rock.  It's the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  Available at adult bookstores anywhere.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony's home.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Let's bring in Stacey Keech.  Freaking legend, man.  I like the way Travis jumped.  Yeah, I like that.  When you said something, Travis jumped. 
[02:27:00]  It's nice to see.  And that should be the reaction around here.  The great Stacey Keech.  How are you, sir?  Opie, Bill Burr, Jim Norton.  How are you?  Of course, here to promote Lights Out, Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on FX.  And other things.  And other things.  I hear there's a, I think he's in a play.  Roland was just telling me, right?  What's that?  Are you in a play as well?  I'm doing a play at Lincoln Center.  And it's getting amazing reviews.  Well, that's always good.  Nice.  What are you doing? 
[02:27:30]  It's called Other Desert Cities, a new play by John Robin Bates.  And we're playing it over at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater.  Wonderful cast.  Stockard Channing, Linda Lavin, Elizabeth Marvill, and a wonderful young actor named Tom Sadowski.  And what's it about?  Well, it's about a family living in 2004.  It takes place in 2004 in Palm Springs.  And a Republican family whose daughter has come back to announce that she's written a book about  a very tragic incident that happened in their lives 28 years earlier when their eldest son 
[02:28:00]  rebelled against all the Republican family values.  He was a liberal and went out, bombed a Marine recruiting station, killed a man, and then  presumably committed suicide.  And the daughter has come back to Palm Springs to announce that she's written a novel or a  memoir about this situation.  And, of course, puts the family into an uproar.  So the play is a comedy.  Yeah.  Very light stuff. 
[02:28:30]  Light stuff.  Like comedy.  There's a lot of funny stuff in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you find, as an actor, because you're obviously a complete veteran, do you find, like, I get,  we just talked about acting, and it's very difficult to do it.  And theater acting just seems harder to project without acting like you're yelling.  Well, you know, that's a very good point.  But another thing that people think about the theater is that how can you do the same  thing over and over again, eight times a week, you know? 
[02:29:00]  And generally speaking, what people don't understand is that it's always a new experience.  It's always very much a now kind of experience, and it depends on the audience, and it also  depends on the other actors.  And this particular play is like, a little bit like a jazz fugue, where everybody has  their solo, everybody plays their riff, and Robbie Bates has done, I think, a miraculous  job with the writing.  And, but it depends on the size of the theater. 
[02:29:30]  The Mitzi Newhouse is very small, so when you're there, you feel like you're in the living  room with these people.  But, I mean, I've played venues with, you know, with 2,500 seats, and that's, you know,  you do have to start shouting in order to get heard.  What's the worst experience you've had, like, doing a play as far as, did you ever just  completely forget your lines or be in a scene with another actor who just completely spaced  and you had to wing it?  Exactly.  Oh, I've had that experience, yeah.  I've had, I've also had the experience where I actually, in fact, it was my Broadway debut  many, many, many years ago, where I was riding this imaginary horse, and it was a horse 
[02:30:00]  that, it was, I had reined, I could control the horse's head.  It was made out of, you know, some material, it was, and I was so nervous, I can't, I got  on stage and I pulled the reins back on the horse's head, and the neck snapped.  And I had to get out of this costume and pick the horse up, I mean, and ad-lib the whole  first, you know.  Now, was the crowd laughing at that point?  No, they thought it was part of the show.  They didn't know. 
[02:30:30]  So you played it off well.  Well, I guess so, because somebody came back a couple weeks later and said, what happened  at that wonderful moment where you broke the horse's neck?  Oh, God.  But I've had experiences also with people, you know, they just go completely up.  You look in their eyes and you know they don't know what the next line is.  They have no idea what's going on.  So what happens on the next performance when you've completely lost faith in that actor?  Were you just like, oh, God, this guy's going to leave me hanging again?  No, you don't lose faith.  You just, you know, you make sure that they, you sort of rehearse it a little bit more before  you go on that night.  Yeah, but they must see the fear in your eyes or the anger or something like, let's go, buddy. 
[02:31:00]  You know, generally speaking, when people go up like that, they're in such a state, they  don't really know what to do.  So, you know, one time I remember a story that a very good friend of mine told.  He said, he began to announce to the audience, he says, now what happens here is, because  the actor who went up, he just left the stage.  He walked right off the stage.  He just, he just disappeared. 
[02:31:30]  So he left the actor hanging out there and he had to just, you know.  Now that has to be like, like the equivalent to war.  That's like leaving your platoon.  I mean, that's got to be, that's got to be unforgivable.  Unforgivable.  No, you can't do that.  You've got to stay there.  You're going to, you know, you have to muscle through.  Did you guys like, like beat him with your scripts afterwards?  Eat your dad.  Learn your lines.  What do you do though?  And that's, that's a great question.  Like when that's happening, how do you hint to the guy?  What are you supposed to, how do you get him to his line? 
[02:32:00]  Well, you, if you know that, that's one of the reasons why it's important.  I think sometimes for an actor to know the other person's line just as well, they know  their own.  Because he said, do you mean that you need to go and see the, the doctor tomorrow?  The plot point?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could do their line.  That's a lot of remembering.  I just want to remember my lines.  That's well, that's what, that, that seems like a nightmare to know everyone's lines  in a play.  It is.  It is.  Yeah.  No, no.  You don't, you know, it's hard enough to learn your own line.  When you get a new script, are you just so, what goes through your head? 
[02:32:30]  Like, ah, I got to freaking memorize all this stuff.  Well, you know, I always think it's important if you can do it to memorize the script before  you go to rehearsal, before you get into rehearsal, before the first day of rehearsal.  So, because if you don't know the music, you don't know how to play the notes.  I mean, you got to know the notes.  You got to know what's going on.  You got to know what those, because you can't really start to work and start to act until,  until it becomes part of you.  Sure.  And, ah, a lot of actors wait until they know what the blocking is, the staging, before 
[02:33:00]  they start memorizing it.  I think it's a, it's, it's, it's dicey.  Everybody works differently.  What is it, just to interrupt you, because that's an interesting point, like, like Brando would  learn the lines, like, when they were like, all right, rolling.  Like, that's when he would start looking at his lines, like, while they were on the wall  in front of him, and he, like, wanted it to be spontaneous.  Well, as he got older, he had problems.  Did he want it to be, did he, or did he, was he lazy?  No, no, no.  Probably spontaneous.  He's a weird guy.  You think?  Yeah.  He was, he was, he was a great, one of our greatest actors ever, I mean, but, but he 
[02:33:30]  used to have, literally have lines plastered on the other actor's forehead, so when the  camera was on him, he'd be reading, he'd be looking at the actor, but he'd be reading  the lines on the forehead.  You know, he had trouble.  He'd be humiliating for the other actor.  He'd be like, yeah, dude, I get you, Brando.  Well, if you're working with Martin Brando, I don't think, you know, it would be, you know.  Did you, did you ever get a chance, did you ever get a chance to work with him?  I never had a chance to work with him.  I, I, I met him and I spoke with him, but I never had a chance to, I wish, that's one  of, I would have loved that.  Were you ever intimidated working with somebody else, like, somebody that you had liked, or 
[02:34:00]  somebody that, who you just admired, that you finally were doing a scene with, and you  just, you were.  Well, I was, I had the great privilege of working with George C. Scott in a movie called  The New Centurion, years ago, it was a cop movie, and he had just done Patton, and he  was hot.  Right.  And, and he was, he was a wonderful, wonderful man, and, and he was a theater actor, too.  I mean, he was a real actor, and, but never thought he had a temper, and, and I'll never 
[02:34:30]  forget, we were shooting a night scene in Los Angeles, and we drove up to this grocery  store in, in, in the, in the scene, and there were a lot of people standing around, because  they knew George C. Scott was there, and he got out of the car, and everybody said, yeah,  me, hey, there's Patton, there's Patton, and he stopped, he looked at his  and he says, I'm not Patton, I'm George C. Scott.  He didn't like being, you know, identified with the character.  He, he, he didn't, he, and I was very, I was surprised by it, but I also understand 
[02:35:00]  it, you know, having done a few characters myself over the years, you know.  What's, what's the character people yell, yell at you the most?  Well, you know, I, when I go into airports sometimes, people say, they, they say, oh,  there, didn't you used to be Mike Hammer, or didn't you used to be the warden on Prison  Break?  The other day, somebody came and said, didn't you used to be Stacey Keech?  You know, so, yeah, I'm talking to Mike Hammer right now.  That's why I love the 80s, you can't have a character named Mike Hammer anymore. 
[02:35:30]  No.  It's just.  That's a poor name.  That's a great name.  It's a poor name?  Yeah.  You didn't even have to know what the show was about.  You just knew that guy didn't take any crap.  Oh, no kidding.  Mike Hammer.  Yeah.  Mike Hammer.  Yeah, Mike Hammer is a man's man, no matter what he does for a living.  Now, Mike Hammer's still alive, too.  We just did a radio novel, two and a half hours, on radio, it's like a, it's a CD, it'll  be out in March, it's called Encore for Murder.  It's like a book on tape, but it's done in a radio show format, with other actors playing 
[02:36:00]  the other characters, and with all the Foley, you know, footsteps, and gunshots, and it's  pretty good.  It's amazing.  You're also getting props for being Christopher Titus' dad.  I did not see.  Titus?  Yeah, you were on Titus.  Yeah, Titus.  A lot of people loved you on Titus.  That was a great show.  Oh, I loved that show.  I love Christopher, too.  I mean, I think he's one of the great comedians, you know, and the show was fabulous.  Yeah, a lot of people were saying, don't forget to mention Titus.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  But we haven't even talked about the new project, Lights Out, Tuesdays at 10pm on FX. 
[02:36:30]  Tuesdays at 10, that's our news time slot, yeah, we're very excited about it.  Jimmy's seen the first three episodes so far.  Yeah, I saw the first three.  What do you think?  Great.  I mean, I didn't know what it was.  I thought it was, because sometimes Roland will give us the diss, and I thought it was  a sitcom.  And I'm like, Stacy, he's going to say, all right.  And then I watched what it was, an hour-long drama on FX.  Right.  And the opening scene in the pilot, it's a brutalized boxer.  He's just, you know, he's been through a fight, and he's bleeding, and he's, and I thought  it was you at first. 
[02:37:00]  I'm like, wow, fucking Stacy looks great.  You know, but it was obviously not you.  He'd play his father.  I was like a complete asshole, and I probably shouldn't have shared that with you.  I just humiliated everybody in the room.  Makeup.  Makeup.  But no, it was a really, it's a great story of a guy whose fighting career is over, and  Stacy plays the father, who's also a trainer, and they own a gym.  And the guy from The Wire who played, Pablo, I don't know his last name.  Schreiber.  Pablo Schreiber from The Wire.  Yeah.  Plays his other son, who's kind of the guy managing the gym, and, you know, it's the two 
[02:37:30]  brothers and the father, and the things they have to do to make ends meet, because apparently  the finances have run out.  Right.  And it's really, really an interesting story.  Yeah, he was, my eldest son, played by Holt McCollum, he was the ex-world heavyweight  champion, and he lost his title, and now he's on the comeback trail to try and regain his  title.  And one of the reasons he lost his title, it has something to do with my character, because 
[02:38:00]  he was ahead on points in the fight, but he had a big gash under his left eye.  And I advised him, I said, stay away, you're ahead on points, don't, you know, don't  blow it.  And then the other guy came forward and started to score points, and he lost the title.  So there's a certain amount of complicity that dad has to live with and deal with, and  retraining this guy to get him back, get him ready for the ring, and get him ready for  a rematch with Death Row Reynolds. 
[02:38:30]  Do you, when you go into a role like that, do you create a backstory, like, or do you  just kind of do it as it comes along?  Like, they say when you're creating a character, like, great, like, Meryl Streep will create,  like, a backstory or have secrets.  You do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have to sit down and sort of write a biography, basically, of the character, and use your  imagination.  Or you can talk with the writer and with the director, and sort of, it's a collaborative  effort where you, you know, you develop, you know, what happened, where'd this guy come 
[02:39:00]  from?  And I think it's important for actors.  Most actors do that.  You know, good actors do that, almost every character they play.  And how many episodes is this?  Because they gave us five, and I watched the first three.  Thirteen.  Oh, it's a full, okay, it's a full.  It's a full, yeah.  It's thirteen, and I think that one of the good things that FX did was they gave a lot  of people the benefit of seeing all the shows before they wrote the reviews, and I think  that that has, I think that's a very smart thing to do, because then you get a sense of 
[02:39:30]  the whole picture, you know, the whole, you know.  Instead of just writing a review after seeing one episode.  Yeah, exactly.  That is smart.  And the reviews are really good on this.  FX is, fuck, they're doing some good things.  Yeah, and that's also, like, that vote of confidence, thirteen episodes, they don't  really do that nowadays.  It just seems like they give you, like, two episodes.  Yeah.  You try to see if you can have a hit stand out in those 600 channels.  I mean, you've actually seen, like, how much, like, it's, like, what was it like being  on TV or something?  Like, I would just think when there was only three networks.  Right.  If you were on something, did you feel like, you know, just walking around, you could tell 
[02:40:00]  people were watching the shows?  It was a whole different world in those days.  I mean, when the original, we did the original Mike Hammer, I think there were, I think Fox  was in the picture at that point.  Right.  But even earlier than that, I did a show in the 70s called Karib, which was like a precursor  to Miami Vice, black cop, white cop situation, living out of Miami.  And we only did 13 shows.  It was a Quinn Martin show.  And there was only three networks at that time. 
[02:40:30]  But there were no reality shows in those days.  Right.  There was a lot more drama, a lot more comedy.  There was a lot more action for actors.  Now, with reality shows and people, real people taking over.  That was brutal.  You know, it is.  It's hard.  It makes it a lot tougher because it's not, you know.  May God bless him.  But I got to admit, when you sit there is actually, you know, as a performer and you watch, like,  Snooki doing panel on The Tonight Show.  You're just sitting there going like, good, what do I got to do?  That's what I got to do.  Obviously, you got to funnel a lot of alcohol into your mouth. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, be a skank.  That's what I got to do.  Fuck everything in sight.  And then you get to sit on the couch.  It is crazy.  I feel bad for you guys.  TV has done it to themselves in a way.  First of all, there's so many channels.  I think they got lazy, though, too, Jimmy.  Very lazy.  It's so much easier and so much cheaper just to throw a bunch of young, good-looking people  in a house and film their shit.  I like how they're running out of dramatic jobs to make shows about.  So now they got, like, a show like this guy.  He makes cakes.  Oh, cake balls.  We got to make this cake by Thursday. 
[02:41:30]  I don't have the frosting.  What do you mean you don't have the frosting?  And then they cut to the guy going, yeah, so Mike was mad we didn't have the frosting.  It's like, dude, there is nothing going on here.  This is a half hour of shit.  I would understand one hour of that.  But he's up to, I think, his third or fourth season still just making cakes.  You're kidding.  You're still making cakes?  Oh, I guarantee you somebody cries at some point.  It's, Stacy, don't watch cake balls.  I won't.  You'll jump out of a window.  Well, yeah.  I really, I generally speak, I watch sports and news.  Yeah, what do you got with sports? 
[02:42:00]  Well, we got a big weekend coming.  Yeah.  Who's your team?  Jets.  Right on.  You're a New York guy.  I am, absolutely.  But, you know, it's going to be a tough game.  Well, he's a Pats fan right there.  Yeah.  Big Pats fan.  Tough game.  We've gone one and one this year.  I know.  That's why I don't like all, I was saying all that trash talking is stupid because it's  actually going to be a great game.  I think it's going to be a great game.  I think they're going to cover, too.  I think the Jets will cover.  What's the spread?  Eight and a half.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's going to be a close game.  Stacy's got some action on the game.  It's going to be a close game.  Eight and a half, yeah.  A lot of action on the game, Stacy, or just fooling around a little bit? 
[02:42:30]  No, no, no.  I'm a low roller.  Low roller?  10 bucks, 20 bucks.  Oh, okay.  Just for fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What part of New York are you from?  I'm not from New York.  No, I'm living in New York now.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm doing this show.  Right.  And we shoot lights out here in New York.  We shot it over in Astoria.  At Silver Cup?  No, Hellgate Studios.  Hellgate.  And if we get picked up for a second season, which I should say, when we get picked up for a  second season.  There you go.  Good for you.  I think we're going to probably, we may move to Silver Cup. 
[02:43:00]  I've been told that.  I don't know.  Where did you, were you living in L.A. before you got the series?  Yeah, I was, yeah.  But I lived in New York years ago.  And I lived all over New York.  I lived in the village.  I lived in the Upper West Side, various places.  But I'm very happy to be back.  I really am.  It's been a while.  You picked a really bad winner.  Well, not as bad as last winter.  We're up there already.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  It's cold out there.  It's cold.  No, there's a lot of snow. 
[02:43:30]  No, they totally overhyped the snow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, people going out buying all that food.  It's like, you can live like 40 days without food as long as you have water.  So you got the snow.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can eat the snow.  You're going to be fine.  There's going to be eight inches of snow.  It's like, wow, that's almost up to my calf.  I don't get that.  How will I ever go out and get some chicken?  I don't get the people that have to go to the grocery stores.  It's all fatties.  It's so weird.  It's that one night where they don't feel guilty for throwing all that stuff down their throat.  Good theory.  Very good theory.  They stock it up, and then it's like, well, we don't want this food to go bad. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  No.  They're making chocolate-covered chicken.  I like it.  Yeah.  It says here, this is one of the first questions I wanted to ask you but didn't.  You're one of the, I really acknowledge Shakespearean actor.  I couldn't do Shakespeare.  Have you ever tried it?  Just in moments.  All right, here we go.  To be or not to be.  Go ahead.  Try it.  Come on, Jimmy.  You can do this.  Let's go.  Come on, Jimmy.  To be or not to be. 
[02:44:30]  Very good.  Wow.  Thank you.  He's a great actor because he just lied saying that was good, and we all believed him.  I like truly well-trained actors, Shakespearean actors.  They have that, you have that, I'm trying to give you a compliment here, that tone in  your voice, that relaxed, like you're sitting here, but you just feel like you could project  all the way to the back of the theater.  There's a few guys, I remember I seen Kelsey Grammer.  Kelsey's great.  Yeah, Kelsey has that, he's Shakespearean trained. 
[02:45:00]  You guys are like the real actors as opposed to, if you checked out my IMD.  He'd be featured.  Stacey, what is it about Shakespeare?  I don't get it, and it seems like a lot of people don't get it.  It seems like a niche thing in this day and age.  It is, it is, and it has always been, I think, in this country.  Well, except, you know, not in the 19th century, obviously, but Shakespeare, for me, it's like  a, it's like climbing mountains.  It's like, you know, there are big challenges, and great, great parts, and great plays. 
[02:45:30]  I mean, Al's doing Merchant of Venice right now on Broadway, and I mean, great success  with it.  He's a wonderful actor.  And, you know, Shakespeare is like the quintessence.  If you can do Shakespeare, it's like they say in the theater, you know, you can do just  about anything.  Could they change it so we can understand it?  Well, I think, you know...  That was my biggest problem, reading that in school.  Reading it is a whole different thing.  I don't know what the hell is going on here.  Generally speaking, you've got bad teachers, you know.  You've got bad teachers.  Yeah.  Probably.  But, you know, if you had a good teacher, or if you go and see a good show that's well 
[02:46:00]  done, you should be able to understand it without any problem.  There shouldn't be any difficulty.  And I think that's true of the current production of Merchant of Venice that's on Broadway.  I really do.  It's actually true.  Because if you watch, like, Telemundo, if you really sit there, you can figure out  what's going on after a minute.  The body language.  Yeah.  Somebody's yelling.  Yeah, a lot of yelling going on.  There was...  A lot of big boobies, too.  Whenever you watch, like, Shakespeare, British actors sometimes just kind of deliver it  very politely.  And then I saw Brando do it.  I think...  I want to say it was Spartacus.  No, it was Julius Caesar. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, Julius Caesar, where he's doing...  He's doing...  He's kind of, like, eulogizing Caesar in front of this giant audience.  It's like an 11-minute monologue.  Yeah.  And he really fucking...  I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome.  Jesus.  That was awesome.  Wow.  But he believes everything he's saying.  And he's like...  It's like...  He's not doing it in one...  He's doing it the way you would actually feel emotion.  It's like that's the first guy I've ever seen actually do Shakespeare, where you can  like, oh, okay, that is really interesting to watch. 
[02:47:00]  And you kind of do pick up what's happening.  The trick with Shakespeare is always, and it's always been, is to make it sound like a contemporary  language.  It's totally understandable.  That's the trick in doing it, you know, and doing it right.  I mean, and doing it for a modern audience.  In America, we don't have much of a tradition of Shakespeare, and that's one of the problems,  you know.  I mean, except in certain places, like in the Shakespeare Theater in Washington, D.C., which  is a great venue, and I've been to a lot of shows down there, and one of the greatest  training grounds in America is the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon, for 
[02:47:30]  young actors.  And it's, you know, you're right, it's a niche thing in a lot of ways, but I think when it's  done well, I think it's very well appreciated by, you know, and as I think Merchant is proving...  By the way, no disrespect, sir.  I just never...  No, no, no.  I hear you.  No, I understand.  A lot of people do it that way.  Because I think most, you know, kids particularly are not given the opportunity to learn it  from good teachers.  Did you ever get to do, like, Hawaii Five-0, or any, like, classic TV show? 
[02:48:00]  Love both.  Yeah.  Happy Days.  Well, I was doing Mike Hammer in those days, you know.  Mike Hammer.  What year was Mike Hammer?  80...  82 to 85.  Yeah, but that was when you, like, you made it.  You were already, like, established.  Well, yeah, because I'd done movies before that.  Yeah.  But, like, when...  I hadn't done...  No, I hadn't done...  No, I didn't do any of those shows.  At that particular point, you know, in later years, I've done a lot of guest shows.  What was Cavalcade?  That wasn't the Gleeson one, was it?  Because he had a show called Cavalcade, I think, or was on one. 
[02:48:30]  The Honeymooners, I think.  Wasn't that one of your first shows?  Was it Cavalcade?  Is it a series in the 50s?  No, no.  You know, my...  It could have been my dad.  Because my dad...  Oh.  My dad's name was Stacy Keach, and I was Stacy Keach, Jr., and then my dad went to Stacy Keach, Sr.  When did you start acting?  Like, when did your career kind of...  The first thing I did was by 1962.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that must have been your dad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Can we have...  None of those classic 60s, Hogan's Heroes?  You never did any of those?  You went straight to movies? 
[02:49:00]  I was in movies in those days.  So that was back then.  If you were a movie guy, you were a movie guy.  That's right.  And it was like you didn't want to do television, you know?  In fact, I mean, you wanted to stay in movies and...  So how did you do that?  Did that take, like, some sort of, like, inner strength where your agent was calling you with TV stuff,  and you were just like, no, I'm not doing it?  That's right.  And you...  Until the phone didn't ring, and I wasn't getting any movie offers, and then they called and said,  you've been offered a series called Karib.  And you're like, I'll do it.  I'll do it. 
[02:49:30]  I did it.  Yeah.  Did you like it?  I loved it, but America didn't like it too much.  We did 13 episodes, and it was down, you know?  But that was...  You know, that's what happens in an actor's life.  I mean...  That's always fun to be on a show that's kind of slowly sinking, and everybody's walking around with their resume under their arm,  but they try to keep the performers happy.  Like, no, no, everything's great.  Everything's great.  Yeah, no, it's no good.  No fun.  How horrible is it when you're at a...  Because I've been to a movie premiere that I was in.  It's one of the worst films I've ever done, and it was like a real low-grade movie. 
[02:50:00]  And just to watch it at a premiere, what a terrible movie you're in, is humiliating.  When you see yourself in a bad movie.  Oh, I stunk.  The script stunk.  Everything stunk.  You just knew it was a bad movie.  Everything stunk.  You know when it's a bad movie, right, Stacy?  You don't necessarily until you...  See it.  See the final product.  Yeah, because sometimes when you're making it, you think, oh, this is going to be great.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I made a movie years ago called Doc.  It was about Doc Holliday, and it was...  I did it with Faye Dunaway and Harris Ulan, and Frank Perry directed it. 
[02:50:30]  And we thought this was going to be, you know...  It was a big studio movie.  Were you thinking Oscar?  Well, not...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  We were just hoping that people would come see it.  Yeah, it was a good, solid movie.  And I'll never forget, we went to that opening night screening, and we were sitting in that  seat, looking at this thing, and we were sinking lower and lower.  Every scene was, you know, it just...  You knew.  We knew.  It stunk.  It stunk.  If I'm ever in that position, if I ever have to do the right... 
[02:51:00]  I would wave, say hello, I'd walk into the theater, and right out the back, there's no  way I would ever sit and watch myself.  I don't know if you...  I don't know...  No way.  I don't know if you want to answer this, but who do you blame?  Because when you're in the moment...  You blame yourself for taking your job.  But you're in the moment, you're thinking, I'm right, my performance is good, and I...  You know...  No, I didn't think my performance was good.  Oh, really?  When you saw it.  No, I didn't.  Well, that's pretty honest.  I don't think most actors would say that.  Well, no, I didn't like myself at all.  They'd blame the director or something.  Or the editor. 
[02:51:30]  Or the key grip guy.  You'd find somebody.  You ever feel like you delivered a great performance, and then you go and you look at the editing,  and you look at the takes, and you're just like, what is this guy doing to me?  Because I feel like...  Exactly.  They can take a great performance and knock it down a few notches, or if you did...  It's one of the reasons why I don't go and see my own stuff anymore.  I really don't even...  I don't like to see my stuff.  Because of that very experience.  A lot of times, when I was a young actor, I would...  Really, I would scientifically and methodically say, I'm going to put this piece together 
[02:52:00]  with this piece, and this piece of behavior with this piece of behavior, and I had it  all worked out.  So, and I went to the director, and I said, I love take two.  Can you use take two and not take three or not take one?  And he would say yes.  And I go and see the final film, and nothing that I did was there.  It was all different, completely changed.  And I realized that that's the prerogative of the director, and the editor, and the producer. 
[02:52:30]  There's nothing the actor can do to control that.  So, the only thing we as actors can control in the movie business is what you put down while  you're shooting.  The behavior that you express, that expression is all you can do.  And the way it's manipulated and put together with other actors and other scenes, you have  no control over that.  So, I don't like to go and see it.  I'm happy with the process.  I'm happy with the process, not the result. 
[02:53:00]  Have you seen the new show?  Have you seen Lights Out?  I've seen pieces of it.  Yeah.  I like it.  I think it's terrific.  It's very well acted.  The relationships are believable.  It's not cheesy.  It's not politically correct.  It was such an odd moment.  There's one scene where two guys are breaking into a car, and they're both black guys.  And that's not a big deal.  But in the way TV is done today, they always mix it up just so as not to, like, no matter  how unrealistic it is.  And it's just like these little things that were not PC in the show made me really like  the show.  Good.  Yeah, well, I hope you're not alone. 
[02:53:30]  I'm looking forward to seeing it.  Yeah.  Yeah, big time.  Yeah.  Tuesday night, 10 o'clock.  Yeah, well, I want to get that plug out.  Lights Out Tuesdays at 10 on FX, so.  I want to do a project with Stacey Keech.  All right.  What do you want to do?  We'll do some Shakespeare.  I can't do Shakespeare.  I don't know any lines.  No, I get it.  Stacey teaches Jimmy Shakespeare.  Jimmy can teach you anything, too, Stacey.  We'll animate it.  Jimmy can teach us himself.  I'm really not a good actor.  And this is, I tell every real actor that comes in here that my problem is with my,  like, I don't know how to, I don't know what to do with my hands when I act. 
[02:54:00]  Just be yourself, man.  Just be yourself.  What you just said with your hands is perfect, you know?  You're just expressing yourself.  You know, that's it.  But as we're talking, I can do that because this is real life.  Because there's no piece of tape on the ground that tells you to stop and sit there.  But if somebody said action, my hands would just be stiff and really unrealistic like a wooden puppet.  Well, the hardest thing to do is to make that transition to, you said, this is real life.  When you're acting, it is real life.  But an actor doesn't, I mean, it takes years of experience to know how to, you know, you're playing another character. 
[02:54:30]  But when that moment comes up, it's real life.  You're just, you're just being.  Are you really listening when another actor's talking in a scene?  Have you heard the line 50 times?  You better be.  Otherwise, it's going to be very obvious that, you know, you're not, it's not good.  You have to, listening is very important.  You know, acting in movies particularly is reacting.  It's not just saying words and running down the street and shooting guns and things like that. 
[02:55:00]  It's reacting.  It's listening.  Listening is a really important part of not only acting, but life.  What?  Yeah.  So, all right, the Jets-Pats game.  Tell me what's going to happen with this game, Stacy.  Come on.  Help me out.  What do the Jets need to do in Foxborough to get this done?  Well, they've got to control Brady.  I mean, you know, they've just got to, you know.  Billy is saying maybe eat the clock.  Do a lot of running.  Yeah, maybe so.  I think the running game is going to be very strong. 
[02:55:30]  I think, you know, it's the defense.  It's that defensive secondary.  You know, that's what we've got to worry about, I think, you know.  So, the big question in my mind is what the over and the under.  What is it?  You're like 45?  Yeah.  Hey, Stacy, you remember Jimmy the Greek, right?  44 and a half.  Isn't he great?  44 and a half.  44 and a half.  That's a tough number.  Yeah, you know.  It sure is.  45-3 last time.  That was 48.  Yeah.  I don't think it's going to be a shootout.  I don't know.  That's like how Jimmy the Greek used to talk about games. 
[02:56:00]  They're just going to pound it out.  Yeah.  You know, I'm taking the lines with the points.  Yeah.  You can't say that anymore.  You've got to act like gambling doesn't exist.  He says he only has a little action.  That's what I do.  Which means he probably has a little action.  For him, a little action.  He has Stacy Keese money.  He probably has a little action.  He's probably $20,000.  Well, he said $10,000 or $20,000.  Right, yeah.  So, now he's taking $1,000 instead of $1,000.  Of course.  He's like, he doesn't play games.  I wish.  I've got two kids in college.  I can't mess around with that stuff.  I'm a low roller. 
[02:56:30]  All right, Stacy.  We should get you out of here.  Yes.  Hey, man.  This is good.  This was great.  We didn't even get to talk to you about Cheech and Chong.  I remember you up in smoke.  That's when I came to know Stacy Keese.  Uh-huh.  So, people must still come up to you.  Yeah.  And quote that movie.  I love that movie.  I love those guys, too.  I just think.  They're great to us.  They come in whenever they can.  They're back together.  I'm so happy.  And there's a possibility.  They're going to, you know, there's another movie in there.  Have you seen their stage show?  Not only saw it, I busted them.  We were in Houston. 
[02:57:00]  I was doing Frost Nixon down there on the road.  And they were doing their show in Houston.  And I went over there as Stadenko and came on stage and busted them.  How crazy did the crowd go?  They loved.  Oh, they went nuts.  Who are you in Frost Nixon and the play, right?  I was Richard Nixon.  Wow.  Yes.  How was that playing?  Is it hard to play a guy that everybody knows what he looks like and sounds like instead  of creating somebody?  It is in a way.  You know, it is.  Because you've got to, first of all, and a great actor, Frank Langella, played him originally 
[02:57:30]  and one of my buddies.  And I didn't want to do anything that was, you know, like that.  I wanted to create my own deal.  But you still, you know, you have to, there are certain things you just, you have to do  in order to be Nixon.  And there's a certain rhythm and there are certain vocal, there are mannerisms that you  have to do.  But beyond that, you've got to get beneath all those manners and find out, you know, where  that, the core of the character lives in you, you know, where's the soul of that guy.  Did you like him or dislike him more after playing him? 
[02:58:00]  I liked him.  And I, it's a wonderful play.  I mean, it really is a terrific piece of writing.  And the director, Michael Grandage, had a very interesting concept about the nature of  these interviews because David Frost and Nixon, they were sort of, you know, two peas in a  pod looking for the same thing.  One wanted to resuscitate his career.  David Frost thought that he was going to suddenly, you know, get out of the talk show rut and 
[02:58:30]  be considered, you know, now he was going to be considered a serious journalist.  And Nixon, of course, wanted to do the interviews in order to resuscitate his image because he,  you know, after Watergate.  And so the dynamic was fascinating.  And Nixon was much better than Frost thought he would be at talking his way out of things,  I think, right until the fourth and final.  Yeah, exactly.  I think that's true.  So, all right.  No, I love it.  All right, Stacey.  Let me, lights out.  It's Tuesday at 10 o'clock on FX. 
[02:59:00]  I wish I had seen more of them.  The three I saw were excellent.  It's a great story.  And I really did, I like it so much.  And I'm very happy for you.  Thanks, Jerry.  And the play.  I might go see that play, too.  Yeah, come over and see us.  It should be around for a while, right?  In the end of February.  We'll be showing over there.  And you should come back and we'll hang out some more.  That was our way of asking for comp tickets to the play.  That's a cheapskate radio.  Yeah, Stacey, we don't pay for anything at this point in our career.  So, if you've got a few free tickets, hopefully front and center, we'll be there for you. 
[02:59:30]  All right, man.  Stacey Keech, everyone.  All right.  Weekend almost here.  I've got a mouthful of food.  How cool was Stacey Keech?  He was really great, man.  I liked it.  He's just an old-school guy. 
[03:00:00]  Bill raised a good point in the break about just talking to him about how you wanted to be guys like him.  Yeah, classic.  I thought of a great question to ask after the interview was over.  Like, I was going to add.  Yeah, like how back in the day, like his generation, generation before were like guys, guys, like all the movies back then, Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, TV shows like Kojak, SWAT.  All those, right into the 80s, Vegas, all those shows, they showed guys, guys.  Being guys.  Yeah.  And womanizing and drinking and, you know, and a lot of the names were probably. 
[03:00:30]  Falcon punching people.  Yeah, they were awesome.  And now it's been, and like, some of it, I guess it is a little bit silly, like how, like guys, guys they were.  But there's just been such an overcorrection.  The other way.  Yeah, where guys now are just like complete pussies.  Yeah, it would be nice if they went back that way slightly, right?  But it's because it's being written by different people too.  Like back then, there were like older school guys who lived a life experience creating these people.  And now it's a lot of it is younger guys who kind of grew up only on television. 
[03:01:00]  This is a whole different generation creating characters.  And it just seems like they're not like they used to be.  I know I'm not saying much there, but I should shut up.  That'll get us to 10 though.  Keep talking.  But like, no, Archie Bunker as a creation is a lot deeper and more layered than anybody who's done a sitcom in the last X amount of years.  I mean, save Taxi.  I mean, you know, you look at the characters now.  They're all just these fucking one level guys who they give little fun things to. 
[03:01:30]  Like, ah, look at this guy.  He loves to, you know, hammer his nails into the wall.  Like that's his thing to make him relatable.  And he gets a laugh doing it.  And then there's always just the random foreign guy from a country that kind of exists, but doesn't really.  You just go in there and you speak in some sort of.  I guess they did that on Taxi, didn't they?  They did.  But Coffin was pretty brilliant.  And it was also like we worked in the mid or early 80s.  I mean, I'm thinking like that dude on that 70s show, which I never really watched.  But every time I would flip through.  Yeah.  He was like, hey, we got to get out of this scene.  How do we get out of this scene? 
[03:02:00]  I have the foreign guys, you know, say something about his pubes and we're into commercial.  But then Coffin would come in as Vic Ferrari, where he just lost his mind.  I'm a huge Coffin fan, but fucking DeVito killed it on that show.  He's one of the best TV characters in history.  Killed it.  Was Louis De Palma.  Unbelievable.  What are your top, top five movie TV characters of all time?  Got to go DeVito and Taxi.  Louis De Palma. 
[03:02:30]  I got one if you want.  Hawkeye Pierce, Alda and MASH.  Obviously, Carol O'Connor is Archie Bunker.  Absolutely.  And the other two I would have to take a second to think about.  I got one.  Mike Brady.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  The dad.  Only because I relate to his personal life.  You got two, Bill.  I got Vinny Barbarino.  There's no way, to this day, if a comedian does a Vinny Barbarino impression, that kills  me.  What I love about that, that is, you see, that's totally John Travolta. 
[03:03:00]  Just, you know, you can't write that.  Right.  And I'll tell you, even as much as people think it's funny, Henry Winkle playing the Fonz.  Like, you watch that show, like, he saves that show.  That show would have been, like, a season and a half, maybe.  Fuck yeah.  And, like, you just watched, like, the stuff that that guy did.  It's like, none of that is on the script.  The last couple seasons were definitely rough to watch, but...  Oh, he was the mechanic shop teacher?  Oh, how awful.  What killed it for me...  He drew the beard.  Did he?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  What killed it for me is when you start hearing real interviews and realizing he's such a 
[03:03:30]  nerd in real life, Henry Winkle.  But that's also what I like about it, when you talk about what a great actor he is, because  he doesn't sound like anything like him.  Yeah, I know, but you kind of want to think he's sort of the Fonz in his real...  I don't know.  I don't know what it was.  It was like taking the curtain away.  I didn't want to see, like, such a wimpy guy was the Fonz.  Well, that was like when he did that movie with Michael Keaton, Night Shift, and all  of a sudden, he was sort of the nerdy guy.  I fucking like that movie.  That was a great movie.  Is it still great?  And how hot was what's-her-face in her panties when she was making the hooker there, when 
[03:04:00]  she was making a breakfast.  That was a big moment for me.  This is before Tube 8 there, kiddos.  That was all you had to live by back then.  I wanted to bring up Night Shift the other day, and I was too scared, because I'm not sure  if it holds up, but I remember that being a really good movie, because Michael Keaton  was on the other guys.  So when I saw Michael Keaton, I'm like, fuck, man, I remember him in Night Shift.  He's done a lot of good movies.  Yeah.  He was Batman and all that shit, but I remember from Night Shift.  Who were your movie...  Like, I used to have...  Terry Garr was huge for me.  Ah.  Well, I mean... 
[03:04:30]  I always wanted a bad movie.  Madeline Stowe.  Madeline Stowe.  There you go.  Bo Derek, which is...  Kate Jackson.  I don't mean like, you know, I mean like...  TV-wise?  No, I'm talking about, not like Farrah Fawcett, who everybody likes.  I know, I was going to say Farrah Fawcett.  Kate Jackson on The Rookies, dressed as the nurse.  I wanted to be Mike Danko.  There's another great TV.  Mike Danko.  I think I was...  They just don't come up with names like that anymore.  I was lame, because I was really into big boobies for a while, so like Wonder Woman and all  that...  Oh, she was a skunkie. 
[03:05:00]  She was the greatest.  All that horse shit.  The thigh-high boots.  I would just focus on big boobs when I was growing up.  I finally matured and realized it's more to a woman than...  Oh, no.  No, you finally...  Big, huge breasts.  No, you were right when you had it for the first time.  Totally.  Big tits are all that counts.  And what was Stacey's character's name?  Was what, Mike Hammer?  Yeah.  How great is that?  What a great name.  Mike Hammer.  He's bringing the hammer down.  You knew what the show was before it even started.  You're never going to try to jerk off a guy in a fucking booth named Mike Hammer. 
[03:05:30]  He's just a man.  Look at that.  And that's all natural, man.  Big natural, fat, heavy tits.  Damn Wonder Woman.  All right, listen, we're going to be wrapping up here.  Bill Burr's going to be in Atlantic City.  Well, we don't have to promote that, obviously.  It's a very exciting show.  A lot of fans are going down to see the big show.  Do you think any boyfriend at the time, he had to have made her put on the Wonder Woman  stage?  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, fuck it, yeah.  She could lose the headband, but she can keep those wrists on.  She could lose most of the rest of her body, but...  Jesus.  God, that's some nice big and heavies. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  I would love to hear her opinions on...  What hood?  A little bit warming.  What are we promoting?  We got...  You should promote the other stuff.  BillBurr.com has all Bill's info.  Yes, I'm going to be at the...  Danny, can you help me out here?  The 17th.  I think February 17th.  I'm going to be at the...  In Tarrytown, New York, at the Tarrytown Merry-Go-Round.  What is it called?  Music Hall.  And I'm going to be at the Count Basie Theater on the 18th in Red Bank, New Jersey.  So, put on your comedy hats and take out those silly wallets. 
[03:06:30]  No?  I want to promote the Monday Morning Podcast.  Monday Morning Podcast.  Let me just help Bill out a little bit.  BillBurr's got a great podcast.  Yes, Danny.  If they would like tickets to the Tarrytown Music Hall show, they may visit tarrytownmusichall.org.  And if anybody would like to see Bill at the Count Basie Theater, you may get tickets by visiting the countbasietheater.org.  Or, all of these dates are available right on BillBurr.com.  Thank you.  That was sweet.  B-U-R-R.  Jimmy, you got tickets going on sale? 
[03:07:00]  I do.  In about seven minutes, tickets from March 5th at the Wellmont Theater in Montclair will go on sale at wellmonttheater.com.  And also, next Thursday through Saturday, the 20th through 22nd, my first trip to Austin, Texas.  Cap City Comedy Club.  When's that?  Everyone's...  The 20th through...  Oh, you're going to have a great time.  Everyone has said Austin fucking rules.  I want to hit the road with you.  I want to go to Austin.  Danny's a big fan of Austin.  I've been there a bunch of times, and when I heard that Jimmy was going to be there, I was like, fuck, I wonder if I can make that weekend. 
[03:07:30]  2021 and 22.  It's a week...  Not this weekend, but next weekend.  No, no, January.  Oh, fuck.  Maybe take that Friday off and go to Austin with Jimmy.  I want to go to Austin so bad.  I've never been.  Everyone likes...  Every comic I know loves it and says it's a great place to do a gig and...  Yeah.  I think you're going to kill down there.  Is it cool?  Yeah, it's a good time.  I just hope the people are there.  What's more humiliating than a fucking curtained-off room?  It's also like...  And it's also when you...  Like, just as an East Coast guy, when you go that deep into Texas. 
[03:08:00]  But Austin is different.  Austin is like the village of...  Right, right, right.  ...of Texas.  But definitely, you know, you go down to, like, Houston.  It's like a little blue dot that just shouldn't be there.  Like, it shouldn't physically be there, but it is.  Like, next year, like, I'm a big LSU fan, so I want to go down, you know, to, like, do  a gig at, like, Shreveport or something.  Jesus.  And I'm just like, who the hell is going to show up?  You should just do it.  Just do it, though.  See, it'll be an experience.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Were you thinking Shelly Long earlier?  Is that who it was? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She was smoking in that movie.  I was confused when you went down the road.  I didn't like Shelly Long ever.  I didn't like what she looked like.  I didn't like her.  I liked her in Losing It, and I liked her in, uh, in, in, uh, oh, yeah, there she is  right there.  Let me take a look.  Haven't some hooker make you scrambled eggs?  I mean, come on, dude.  It doesn't, the, uh, the panties doesn't hurt.  Oh, she's sexy there.  Wow.  Well, look, you got on this.  I never found her, like, sexy, I guess.  There she is.  Okay, well.  Yeah, well.  Look, those panties are a little big for nowadays. 
[03:09:00]  She's dishy.  I'll say.  Big hairy pussy in there.  Oh, tremendous.  That's a world of hurt.  Tremendous.  We got one more thing, um, Bobo has to voice a promo, and he doesn't know what the promo's  about.  Yeah, no.  We want him to do this cold, because it just, it's just more fun when we play it back on  the channel.  Where's Bobo?  It don't, and don't worry, this is a quickie.  Also want to thank stalker Patty.  She kicked fucking Oscar's ass in the gun debate.  Great job, Patty.  I was kind of bored with all the stats, but she was, uh, she was well versed. 
[03:09:30]  That was 45 to 3.  45 to 3?  All over again.  Can't argue that.  Patty, thumbs up on, uh, knowing your shit about guns.  What's up, Bobo?  I'm doing good.  I didn't ask.  Raise the mic.  You have to raise the mic up a little bit there.  It's for, I want to hear Daniel.  It's good.  Hi.  Okay.  People love you on this show.  It's just amazing.  He looks like a nerdy Juan Epstein.  Nothing.  You all right?  Why are you dressing nicer?  No, I don't know.  I just, is that like a Christmas sweater or something?  Probably.  No, no, I've had this for a while. 
[03:10:00]  I just said to dress nice today.  That's all.  Well, you look big from return to the show, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look terrific.  And we want you to just voice a promo for us if that's okay.  All right.  No problem.  And we want you to read it cold, so we don't need any music.  We just got to shut our mouths?  Yeah, we'll be fine.  Okay.  This is Bobo.  Hi, everyone.  It's me, Bobo.  Are you sick of hearing my voice?  Well, you're not alone.  That's why the show is finally getting rid of me. 
[03:10:30]  Yes, Dick has run its course.  And now it's up to you to find the next Bobo.  They were freaks before me.  They were freaks after me.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sorry.  We could obviously edit.  Start with there again.  They were freaks before me.  They were freaks after me.  Why can't you see the word be?  Start again.  There.  They were freaks before me.  There will be freaks after me.  If you're a monstrosity or you know a monstrosity like me, 
[03:11:00]  email Opie and Anthony at...  Oh, man.  Email Opie and Anthony at SiriusXM.com  and tell the show you could be a star just like I used to be.  Now all I got left is my relatives,  who I've had sex with.  Goodbye, everybody.  Bye, Bobo.  There's the door. 
[03:11:30]  We tricked you.  We wanted you to come in and read a promo.  And you read it perfectly, Bobo.  What's wrong?  Bobo.  Yeah?  Do you have one last thing to say?  I don't know.  I'm not going to say it.  Say it real quick.  Just for fun.  No, I'm not going to say it.  For the promo.  We need it for the promo.  Just for the promo.  I'm not going to say it.  We need it for the promo.  Bobo, you feel like we tricked you?  What do you mean?  We wanted you to read a promo.  How did we trick you?  I don't get it.  No, that promo. 
[03:12:00]  I didn't know that was a farewell promo.  Yeah.  It certainly was.  Say that last thing that we need for the promo.  Yeah, but that I can't say.  We just need it for the promo, buddy.  Yeah, but that is the line.  Real quick.  It is the line.  We need it.  Alright, that is the line.  We need the last line for the promo.  Alright, I guess.  I guess they'll say it. 
[03:12:30]  Um's box.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program. 
[03:13:00]  I'm Jim Norton and Opie's chewing and Anthony's looking at a naked 18-year-old.  We have the great Bill Burr in the studio.  No, I'm not.  In town from California.  I'm going to see what Anthony's looking at.  Look.  There's no one naked on the screen at all.  There's just...  There's a girl in the yellow.  Wow.  What is that?  That is a filthy whore.  A filthy whore.  In a good way.  In a good way. 
[03:13:30]  My ass feels really good because I've been doing the elliptical machine.  I actually like touching my own ass now.  Do you?  Yeah.  I like cupping it.  It's got like a plumpness to it.  It never had.  Stop being a braggart.  I'm getting some physical therapy and they had to point out that I have an atrophied butt,  Bill Burr.  Atrophied?  Yeah.  You've missed a lot.  Yeah.  How did your ass become atrophied?  You're sitting here doing radio every day?  I went in because I have a bad shoulder.  I got a torn tendon. 
[03:14:00]  So I'm going the physical therapy route and they're beating the crap out of me.  And then they decided they were comfortable enough with me to tell me what else is wrong  with my body.  Like I was a sorority girl and they had laser pointers.  Like this is not what I signed up for.  But I learned I got an atrophied butt that they're working on.  Is it reversible?  Yeah, it is.  Just one cheek though, right?  Yeah, one cheek.  Because of two herniated discs.  So you ask, when something's atrophied, doesn't the muscle shrivel up?  Do you have one shriveled up butt cheek? 
[03:14:30]  I want to see his ass so bad.  It looks like an old orange.  You know what one's like?  That's depressing it.  It's coming along nicely though, they say.  Whatever.  That's what happens when you go to the doctor, man.  Then they find other stuff.  It's like taking your car into the mechanic.  No kidding.  Man, you are so right.  That's why guys don't go to the doctor.  We don't want to know.  It's better not to know.  Well.  Oh yeah.  Just probably not.  I know they could like.  Just drop.  Not really, but.  I know they could like. 
[03:15:00]  Do the roast beef sandwich just out of nowhere.  You just drop.  That's it.  Done.  That's the way to go though, right?  Yeah.  Nice and quick.  Not knowing instead of like the doctor telling you.  Oh boy.  I'll give you eight months.  You better sit down.  We found something.  Yeah.  It gives you eight months.  Now you got to take up sailing and all this other crap you wanted to do.  I couldn't pay the bill, so he gave me another two.  They are.  They're better off going though.  Like I went.  I'm 40 now.  I went to get something done and I asked for a certain kind of testing for a cancer.  And she said, well, you're not 50, so they might charge. 
[03:15:30]  I'm like, I don't care.  I'll pay for it.  Yeah, they're always so like quick to throw the money thing at you.  Well, the insurance isn't going to...  Dad, do it.  Just do it.  My health.  Do it.  I'll pay.  I got a credit card.  Insurance is the biggest scam ever.  Oh my God.  Yes.  You're paying for protection.  I think the Rothschilds running the whole insurance, every insurance company.  No, they finance them.  Oh, they finance them.  Yeah, they finance everybody.  Okay.  Jimmy and I go to this really hot Russian doctor though. 
[03:16:00]  She actually said to me that I'm a fine specimen.  And then she kind of leans over with her little skirt and she's got cleavage showing in a bra  to write down the stats.  And an accent?  I was ready to be part of a portal, I think.  Where it starts at a doctor's office, right?  She's hot for a doctor, yeah.  I mean, like if I saw her on the street, I would think she's just an average lady.  For an MD, she's sexy.  But she has no problem showing your little bra with the blouse button, the unbuttoned one too low. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I always look at the rubber gloves and I'm like, you want to put them on?  I mean, I'm here.  Yeah, why not?  Let's get everything checked while we're at it.  Doc, huh?  Well, I was actually psyched.  I turned 40 in June and for some reason for white males, they put off that whole ass exam  to now when you're 50.  Oh, really?  So I'm like, oh, great.  It's perfect.  Gee, that sucks.  The colonoscopy?  No, wait, are you talking the pipe or just the quick prostate? 
[03:17:00]  In my head, I was like, I don't have to have anything examined.  The prostate check?  Have you had the prostate check?  Nope.  Oh, boy.  See, I went in.  I ate plenty of fruit.  And had to do that.  Had to get the prostate check.  I went in.  For a day.  Checkup.  I'm like, I don't know.  No.  I went in for strep throat and I got the strep throat.  Did the guy just put his finger in there?  I told the story many times.  I had to change doctors because I think something's going on with this one. 
[03:17:30]  He's just, he's done that twice.  And I didn't go in for that.  He did it again?  Twice.  And you let him?  That's your fault.  Yeah.  Well, I went to our doctor and I got my prostate because I tinkle a lot.  So I'm like, there's got to be something wrong with my bladder or my prostate.  There's something wrong.  And I had them both sonogrammed.  Sonogrammed?  Yeah.  It's like where they make you drink a lot of water. 
[03:18:00]  And it's like a 20-minute procedure where she videos all the inside of it.  And they press down on you.  And you have to go to the bathroom.  It's awful.  But she's like, yeah, it's normal size.  No lumps on it.  Fun story.  Are you a hypochondriac?  Do you like a...  I'm not that bad, no.  I think you just like that whole environment.  It reminds me of one of those jerk shops.  It's kind of legal.  You go in there.  Like you said, there's the gloves.  Yeah.  There's that smell of alcohol in there.  If Jimmy had kids, he'd be one of those that have that Munchausen syndrome by proxy 
[03:18:30]  or something where you keep your kids sick just to be in the hospital.  What is that called?  It's like Munchausen syndrome by proxy.  And it's usually a mother.  Like 99% of the times.  It's rarely ever the father.  The mother keeps their child sick to get attention for themselves.  So they build up a relationship with the doctors, the nurses.  They love the sympathy that they get.  So they keep their child sick by giving them either poison in their food. 
[03:19:00]  But I thought they'd kill them, don't they?  That happens eventually.  In some cases.  A kid can only be that sick so long before they die.  But, yeah, it's such a selfish...  Oh, my God.  It's such a selfish thing.  And they gave it some name.  I don't know why.  It's Munchausen syndrome.  Tastes like almonds.  Yeah.  That was always...  I liked it in Sixth Sense.  Oh, yeah.  When that girl was just throwing up in front of the poor little petrified kid. 
[03:19:30]  And they get the video.  Yeah, the videotape.  Hey, give it to the father.  He watches it.  And you actually see the wife pouring, like, Drino into the kid's soup.  She was doing a terrible puppet show.  She deserved it.  It was an awful puppet show.  The puppet show stunk.  Oh, I'm sick!  Shut up.  I'm some poison idiot.  You rotten, bad puppeteer.  That is a sick disorder, man.  That's Misha Barton.  That's twisted.  Yeah.  There are a bunch of those. 
[03:20:00]  I like watching those stupid crime shows on A&E and stuff.  They always come up.  She had Munchausen syndrome, my proxy.  This is the disease that women get from the level.  You know where the 11th child got sick?  Yeah, yeah.  People started asking questions.  Really?  11 kids.  You know where the name comes from?  Uh, Baron von Munchausen.  Stunt brain, you're fired.  We don't need you anymore.  All right.  He came up with it on his own.  You're out.  Sorry.  You're right.  Which was a movie, uh, Monty Python put out, I believe. 
[03:20:30]  Oh.  No, I just knew that.  Ted Munchausen.  He was a...  Ted...  I'm Ted Munch...  My baby's sick.  Help.  He's got the sniffles.  He fell down the steps again.  Ted Munchausen.  Oh, no.  My kids are dead.  Give me a hug and some flowers.  Every character he does now is named Ted.  Yeah.  Just go with it, Bill. 
[03:21:00]  Just, just, yeah.  Same voice, everything.  I was literally sitting here going, I didn't see that one.  Oh.  I didn't see that Monty Python.  Ted has been many things on this show in recent months.  Yeah, he was a famous liar, this Baron guy.  Hey, it's a very sad day, Ant.  Why?  Why?  Well, we lost, uh, Del Martin.  Where'd he go?  She.  Well...  Where'd she go?  You guys remember who Del Martin is?  Think?  I do.  Let me think.  Jimmy knows.  I do.  I read the story.  It's an economist.  Famous economist.  Oh, yeah, probably.  We did easily an hour on Del Martin. 
[03:21:30]  Did we?  Easily.  That movie critic who wears the bow tie and has the afro.  That guy?  Gene Shalott.  Gene Shalott, yeah.  Del Martin was that old broad that got married to the...  Oh, her old lesbian...  Wow, she's a widow already?  She just got married.  They made marriage legal in San Francisco.  She was the first, one of the first to take the plunge, if not the first.  Del Martin was something like 87,  and her partner was whatever, 
[03:22:00]  pretty much the same age.  And I think Del Martin was the one in the wheelchair  when they were getting married?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, well...  And she passed away.  Yeah, I actually...  Did she have money?  Huh?  Did she have a lot of money?  She was just like this major lesbian activist.  Yes.  They think her partner killed her.  It was Muncher Syndrome.  Muncher...  I actually got a little choked up reading the story.  It was sad.  It was sad.  It was awful. 
[03:22:30]  Why stop?  We love Del Martin.  Remember?  Do we?  Remember that old bit with lesbians?  Come on out.  Lesbians, yes.  Yeah, lesbian rights pioneer Del Martin dies at 87.  Yeah, we...  Oof.  Yeah.  It's probably way easier to come out as a lesbian  because, like, more people understand.  Especially at that age.  Oof.  I was going to criticize you.  What are they doing?  You know they're not having fun lesbian sex or anything.  They're just... 
[03:23:00]  They're really just in love with each other.  They have been for years.  Is that Del's lady with the...  She looks like...  Like Ralph Crandon with glasses?  I'm not.  I'm not.  Yeah, that was...  What's her name?  Phyllis.  Phyllis Lyon.  Phyllis was awful.  Yeah, Phyllis was...  And then the other one.  Not a looker.  I thought that was Billie Jean King.  Oh, Phyllis is terrible.  Yeah.  Well, we lost out.  We always goof, though, that in the old days when they had to hide it, 
[03:23:30]  like the media and just people, newsreels,  they just never understood gays.  Right.  So they would just be like,  and these two ladies are quite the lookers.  Yes, gentlemen.  Any gentlemen callers for these two?  They're always out to get...  Two gentlemen to take them out.  Not understanding.  They don't want guys.  They just didn't want to acknowledge it back then.  And there was the old gay couple, the guys.  It's like, hey, ladies, these men aren't taken. 
[03:24:00]  They're like frolicking in a pool with a beach ball.  Gus and Elmo.  Gus and Elmo?  Elmer.  Elmer.  Gus and Elmer.  That was the name.  Gus and Elmer.  Yeah.  Yes, they're fresh back from the war and looking for action.  Are they?  You know what's funny back then?  Every guy who was in shape, like they had no muscles.  They just had that I'm in seventh grade torso.  You notice that?  Like, man, you weren't fat.  Right.  You could be barrel-like or something. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, if you watch Ben-Hur and all of them, they have just these straight arms.  There's no tricep or body.  It's like skin hanging on the bone, but they're not fat.  They all weigh like 140 pounds.  Yeah.  You just thrust your chest out.  It was like watching Tony Curtis and Spartacus.  It's like, I'm a gladiator.  My name's Spartacus.  And he just looked like crap.  And then nowadays, you turn on the 300 and go, Jesus Christ.  How do you get a body like that?  Dude, it's a whole group of guys that have nothing but abs. 
[03:25:00]  Dude, Ben Stiller is shredded in comedy.  Yeah, what the hell is that about?  He jumps in the pool.  He's got an eight-pack.  I'm like, really?  Ben Stiller.  To do a comedy?  He was shredded.  I was like, oh my God, I got to go to the gym.  Tropic Thunder is shredded.  Judah Ben-Hur with a big barrel chest and a gut.  I'm in great shape.  Are you, Chuck?  Yeah, as long as your chest was out further than you.  Yeah, and they'd suck their gut in when they take their shirt off.  They'd suck it in and it would just look horrible.  Johnny Weissmiller, the guy who played Tarzan.  Tarzan, yeah. 
[03:25:30]  He had his little leaf shorts pulled up beyond his navel.  Remember that?  And he would be sucking it in.  The first guy who played Batman.  Remember him?  Yeah.  The utility belt cranked.  Oh, yeah.  Adam West.  Adam West, yeah.  Yeah, and the stretchy material was all stretched.  And you could see how doughy his stomach was.  Yeah, really have come leaps and bounds from those days.  Yeah, no core strength.  Now it doesn't matter what you're doing.  Everybody's going to be shredded in the movies and TV.  You should see the way people work out in L.A. 
[03:26:00]  I'm telling you, if you want the next big money-making thing, get into hip replacements  and knee replacements.  Really?  They're doing that muscle confusion.  You confuse it, man.  It doesn't have time.  What?  It doesn't have, well, basically, they say if you do the same workout, after a couple,  two, three weeks, your body gets used to it.  And you stop getting results, so what you do is you confuse it, is you just perpetually  have it, I don't know, just constantly doing these different exercises.  I was literally on the treadmill.  I'm doing all the old school stuff.  I felt like I should have been wearing the gray pullover sweatshirt. 
[03:26:30]  Like Jack LaLanne doing calisthenics.  Yeah, and this dude is literally, I swear to God, this is what he's doing.  He would jump up, grab the chin-up bar, he'd do a pull-up, then he'd come down, he does  one jumping jack, drops down into the squat, and then goes into like a push-up, and like  spread his legs, jumped up, and then brought them back together.  Oh, his muscles didn't know what was going on.  And then did a push-up, and then went back, and he did like a set of 30 of those, and  I'm like, shoulders, knee, oh, that's going to be a hit. 
[03:27:00]  And the whole time he's jumping up and landing back down, and the best thing, too, is he was  completely out of shape, so he just probably watched like that P90X video.  Have you seen that guy where they have all those 40-year-old weird-looking guys who are  shredded, and they've lost the elasticity, so it still doesn't look good?  You know what I mean?  Dude, past 48, it's like, dude, keep your shirt on.  Just keep your shirt on, just as long as it's straight.  You know what I mean?  You'll look fine.  Oh, my God.  That's the confusing muscles. 
[03:27:30]  I don't think the muscles can really be confused like that.  They swear by that crap.  Do they?  I've heard that.  I do the elliptical every day, or most days, but it's like, if you jog every day, you still  lose weight.  Of course you do.  People that go out and jog every day, what do you jog sideways and then jog on your hands?  You just go out and run.  Yeah.  That's all you need to do.  I know if you're-  Stop eating like a pig.  If you're working out and eating right, it doesn't matter if your muscles are dazed and  confused.  You'll be fine.  You'll work-  There's no money in that. 
[03:28:00]  No, no.  You got to have some trainer that's going to tell you, you got to mix up the muscles.  First of all, don't let your muscles hear this.  Yeah.  We're going to confuse them.  What?  After the work day, you have a homosexual encounter, you confuse your ass muscles.  What's happening?  Confuse your family.  Your throat is nervous.  He's never done this to me before.  Tastes funny.  We got a pretty fun story worth playing today. 
[03:28:30]  Bill Burr, by the way, Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I want to go, Bill, but I'm going away this weekend.  You've come out to plenty of my shows.  I know.  It's actually a quick ride from the city until you hop on the New Jersey Transit.  If you're in Manhattan or whatever, you can still go down.  It's a very easy ride to Albany Street in New Brunswick.  You just get off the train literally a block, block and a half, you're at the club.  It's a three-minute walk.  You know, one night I went to take the train back and I wasn't paying it.  I have a really bad sense of direction.  I got on the train and I went the wrong way. 
[03:29:00]  Started going down towards Philly.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't realize it until the fourth or fifth stop.  Oh, my gosh.  Ended up taking like a $150 cab ride back.  You see Philly's awful skyline.  You're like, wait a minute.  What is this?  No, I ended up in a Denny's.  I ended up stopping.  I sat in a Denny's.  I'm like, what am I going to do?  When's the next train?  The next train's in two hours.  So I ate a Grand Slam breakfast.  Like, what am I going to do?  And the worst time, I don't get recognized that much.  And, of course, the waiter's like, hey.  I know you.  Yeah, you're that comedian guy. 
[03:29:30]  What are you doing here?  It was like four in the morning.  I'm like, oh, I got on the train going the wrong way.  Hey, that's a funny joke.  You're going to put it in your act?  No, like any sort of shine that he saw of me was just completely gone.  I was just a complete loser.  I don't talk about it.  He'll talk about us in his routine.  Hey, watch out what you say to him.  He's on the radio.  It'll end up on his show.  Hey, I bet this is on his show tomorrow.  No, it won't be.  This is the most boring thing that's ever happened to me.  Are you going to use this? 
[03:30:00]  I know you're going to use this.  You're going to use it.  And you always got to grab a friend over.  Look out what you say now.  You'll see, it'll end up in his act.  I'm going to use this as a counting sheep, you dullard.  Yeah, because it's always just such captivating, compelling stuff that they're talking about.  It usually ends with 23 back slaps.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  You don't care, right, Ed?  Slap, slap.  No, you should get away from me.  Kill you.  Keep listening so I make the money, but get away from me.  Keep away.  Please, please.  Buy all the paraphernalia, but get away from me. 
[03:30:30]  Thank you.  I hate when they come up to you and they'll compliment you and go, hey, I really like your act.  You know, and they're like, can I get a picture?  I mean, I ain't gay or nothing.  Like, I know this is gay.  It's like, all right, just ask for the picture.  Stop justifying yourself.  Let's do it.  Now you made it awkward.  Do I have to really bail you out emotionally?  Take the picture and go away.  Scumbag.  Bill, you get back to Boston?  I haven't been back there in a minute.  I was going to be, I'm actually doing a college coming up, UMass Amherst with Charlie Murphy in a couple weeks.  But I was scheduled to come back, but the comic connection moved. 
[03:31:00]  Recently, I don't know where they are.  They moved to a theater.  It's like a theater.  Yeah, I'm doing it in, I think, November.  It's something.  Doesn't your family miss you up there, though?  Yeah, I guess so.  Hope so.  I don't, I was there for Christmas.  I think this is the first Christmas I'm not going back.  I just can't.  I can't at 40 go back, unmarried, no kids, and just sitting there, just, you know.  My nephew's like 27, you know. 
[03:31:30]  I just can't, I can't do it.  At some point, I've got to create my own lonely Christmas.  Bill, you've got to bring a guy friend.  As a goof, you've got to bring an effeminate guy friend.  Just ask my roommate.  Oh, God.  Get your whole family miserable.  As a goof.  And never address it.  Don't address it.  No, just ask my buddy.  He doesn't have any place to go.  And then just have it be like a really subtle, obvious thing, like the little looks you give  each other.  Yeah.  Oh, like, yeah. 
[03:32:00]  You're looking at a girl.  And Brian.  Just until someone notices and then look away.  Oh.  Any time I go to tell a story, it'll be like, and Brian, and I'll like squeeze his hand.  It's all the same.  Brian here.  His forearm's good.  How bad would that be?  How nervous would your family get, like, start looking around?  What the hell?  Your dad would understand, right, Bill?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He totally would understand.  He would have a problem.  A lot of tolerance there for that kind of thing?  No.  It's not like he's homophobe, but, like, yeah, he's a very emotional guy. 
[03:32:30]  He would end up screaming about it at some point during the night.  Yeah.  Like, in what way?  For Christ's sake, he's gay!  Well, what do you think they're in the same room for?  My dad is the funniest dude ever.  He gets so worked up, he has no idea that he's giving away the whole playbook.  I didn't say that.  Dad, you screamed it at four in the morning.  He'd be in the next...  Oh, Christ, I'm tired.  That's his excuse for everything.  I said, I'm working too many hours. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, Christ.  All right, let's play this here.  Dude, what a great...  You know how funny that would be, like, as a sketch or something?  Like, you know, Tom Green used to do weird stuff at his parents' house?  That would be a great...  Yeah.  You bring a camera and just say that you and Brian are filming it just so you have it,  and they have no idea that you just goof...  Oh, then the great thing with the cameras, and they couldn't...  They'd be afraid to actually ask, so you could have the awkwardness even longer.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They don't know what's going on TV.  What are you doing?  What are you... 
[03:33:30]  I don't want to...  Could you turn the cameras off?  Are you sucking his...  No, but the guy has to be, like, really...  Play it, like, really subtly, like that guy in Dog Day Afternoon.  Oh, right.  Where you know he's gay is because he has his hand on his chest the entire time.  Oh, yeah, Leon.  Oh, Leon.  Yeah.  And he had this stupid robe, and the funny part is he's like,  hey, you're a bunch of crazy people, and the cops are snickering behind him.  Yeah, yeah.  He actually died recently, the real Leon Shermer.  I forget what...  He died of AIDS.  He became a woman. 
[03:34:00]  Really?  He did get his operation.  Yeah, Sonny Wartick is now dead.  Who saw that coming?  Wow.  Yeah, he did get his operation, and he eventually died.  Poor guy.  All right.  Yeah.  Did it wreck the flow?  No, no.  No, it's good.  Good info.  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  That's great.  Poor Sal.  They're saying there's two homosexuals.  Stupid Sal with his machine gun.  All he wanted to do was murder women in the bank.  Did that actor ever get to play the guy?  He's always like the sad sack dude on the side who never quite knows what's going on. 
[03:34:30]  John Cazale.  He was in The Godfather.  He was Fredo.  He was in The Deer Hunter.  He was in some of the biggest movies ever.  Always the schlep guy.  He died of old pudding head disease, too.  Yeah, cancer.  Married to Meryl Streep.  No.  Yeah, I believe he was, John Cazale.  Really?  Am I wrong?  Really?  We're going to have to look that up there, John.  Please, Stunt Brain, look it up.  You're humiliating me.  Come on, Stunt Brain.  Dude, he's dead.  John Cazale died many years ago.  I'm getting so old.  When I see people like that, to him, to me, he's 50.  He was engaged in Meryl Streep. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, he's engaged in Meryl Streep.  He was, yeah.  She broke it off.  Yeah.  He would have been 73 if he was still alive.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jesus.  We've got a quick little story here for everybody.  Well, a man from Moline is now charged with holding five people hostage in Fort Madison, Iowa.  He was caught when he sent two of his alleged victims on a beer run.  Police say it started when 33-year-old Jason Slegel pulled a knife during an argument.  What a dope this guy is, huh?  The 33-year-old Jason Slegel pulled a knife during an argument with another man on Tuesday 
[03:35:30]  night, told the other people in the room that they were not allowed to leave.  Eventually, Slegel got thirsty, sent two of those hostages for beer, who then called  police, and they came to the rescue.  Did he really hold five people hostage with a knife?  That's pretty stupid.  I'm not a tough guy, but if there's five of us and you have a knife, you're in trouble.  We're going to give it a shot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm not the guy who has, like, the knife on me.  Right, right, right, yeah. 
[03:36:00]  That's when you give him the Lawrence Taylor blind side to the back, cause him to fumble.  What a bad hostage taker.  Go get me some beer, and you better come back, or I'll, what, cut one of us?  Shut up.  It's good to know we have XM listeners, that we can't go to the phones because they're  all calling to say we're not on the air, right?  Is that what they're all calling about?  Can we get the word out through the pad data, like, they know, stop calling, they're working  on it?  It's because I brought up the Rothschilds.  Did you notice that?  I brought them up.  Ah, see? 
[03:36:30]  Cut to all communications.  I tried to tell you, I only wanted to talk to you during break.  They're behind the merger, man, I'm telling you.  All right, we're going to break Illuminati stuff.  Yeah, that's scary.  That's all I think about now is the Illuminati.  Just think that they're running things, and this is all a facade.  Everything else, the government, everything's a big facade, just to keep everybody.  It's like the Matrix.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all looking at pictures of Britney Spears' vagina. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  We have no idea of anything else.  Nothing else.  We're captivated by that.  They throw distractions at us at perfect times.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  First I came in here, hey, did you see the new Mets stadium?  Yeah, see?  Hey!  Rothschild.  But would they allow the internet to actually, now they're starting to be revealed, all this  talk, the books about the Illuminati, would they allow all this information?  If they were so good to...  No, they're shutting it down.  In 2012, they're coming out with the internet, too, and it's basically going to be glorified 
[03:37:30]  basic cable.  Seriously, you're going to have to pay for extra, I don't know, websites.  How is that going to work?  Is this true?  Yeah.  It's being talked about, yeah.  No, it isn't being talked about.  It's actually a law.  It's going to be happening.  I don't think that's...  How the hell can that happen?  Yeah.  If you get a new passport, there's a little microchip in it now.  Really?  Yeah.  They're going to...  Basically, they're starting with dogs.  They're putting in dogs.  Yeah.  And they're going to be like...  So unattractive women have a passport.  Yeah, exactly.  Microchip.  No, they're going to start with the dogs. 
[03:38:00]  You know, what if Fido gets lost?  They'll have a couple of those stories on TV, and then they were able to find him, and  the dog was okay, and everybody excited.  Then they'll start a panic about your kids getting abducted, so they'll give them some  sort of wristband to wear, and then eventually they'll slowly...  It's already...  There's a commercial.  Oh, it's already in their shoes.  You see the commercial on television?  Yeah, you can put it.  Where the mother is in a park, and she starts to panic.  She's like saying her kid's name, Kevin, Kevin, or something, and she pulls this thing  out of her purse that's going beep, beep, like in Aliens, when they're looking for 
[03:38:30]  the aliens, and it's beeping, and she sees a little dot, and she follows it, and there's  her son, because he's got some kind of chip on him, she can find it, and then it was for  Duracell batteries, because, you know, she only depends on Duracell to find her kids.  Yeah, they're slowly, gradually getting...  It's like cloning.  They're not just going to clone a guy.  Hey, we got another Dick Cheney.  This one's got a good heart, huh?  It's going to freak everybody out.  They start small.  They start with like a goat or a squirrel.  Oh, it's adorable.  And they'll gradually work their way up, so eventually, probably by the end of my lifetime, 
[03:39:00]  it'll be mandatory.  Every baby that is owned, right between their eyes, they're going to have this big chip.  And all your information is going to be on it, and that way, then they got you.  If you mess with the deal, they just turn your chip off.  Wow.  You hear about Andy?  They turned his chip off.  Turned his chip off.  Then you're out in the street.  Wow.  In your bathrobe with all your pistols.  Chipless.  And that's why you're fishing and learning how to hunt.  That's how they're doing it, yeah.  They're not going to get you.  Not getting me.  Hey, I caught a striped bass. 
[03:39:30]  I know what I'm doing.  What's this charge for internet thing?  That bugs me.  I won't like that at all.  Who's going to do it?  Well, the thing I love about all this stuff is we don't get to vote on any of it.  We don't get to vote on any of it.  And they just come up with these laws.  Oh, yeah, by the way, who's complaining about the internet right now?  I'm not.  I love it.  No, it's great.  I like having everything available.  Well, you can kiss that goodbye in a couple years, sir.  They can't tax it.  They're not making any money off it.  They lose these scumbags.  They're losing money on the phone bill or all these other ways that people are communicating 
[03:40:00]  because of emails.  They're losing postage because people are not just mailing letters anymore.  No, but the big thing is you lose control of people.  You have to be able to control the information that they see.  That way, the lie matches up with the information and you're able to continue on.  But if people can kind of bounce around, then you get all these other guys, like info war  guys, like them saying all that stuff, like, hey, here's another side of the argument.  So what they, you know, they'll gradually funnel it in.  Too much information is being made available to people, which informs them, and an informed 
[03:40:30]  people is dangerous to any government.  There's some old white guy sitting in a castle right now.  There's too much information, I think.  Let out over the air.  We must crush it.  Grandfather Rothschild.  Just swimming in gold.  What do you do with all that money?  I think they just roll around.  Like those coins, putting it under their armpits.  Oh, it's cold.  Yeah.  He's actually Sir Theodore Rothschild. 
[03:41:00]  People are talking about us.  Let's lock up the internet.  Theodore.  I think we've got to step aside for a few minutes.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I would love to see it.  Oh, you would love to see drinking.  Oh, drinking Jimmy.  Drinking Jimmy.  You'd like it for an hour.  No, I would like it right up until you either killed yourself, somebody else, had a nervous 
[03:41:30]  breakdown, ended up in the hospital, jail.  Yeah, it would be awful.  Yeah.  Awful.  You're one of those guys who realized you had a drinking problem at like eight, aren't  you?  Well, I was 18.  It was after the first time when I was a younger teenager, I told them that my first  few drinks were rum.  I vomited like little bread balls into a tent and I pulled a box cutter out and wanted  to cut somebody because they didn't shake my hand right.  Yeah, he, he like, you're allergic to alcohol. 
[03:42:00]  I sure am.  It's so weird.  A couple of sips, he's in the Warriors.  He had to quit at a time where everyone who drinks is an idiot.  Like, you can't tell who's an alcoholic.  Yeah.  It's 18.  You're binge drinking with your friends and acting like a complete ass.  But you were so far beyond that that he even knew at that age.  Like, you don't pull out box cutters and try to cut your friends for not shaking your  hand right.  Or walk down the street with a big knife looking for the FBI, was it? 
[03:42:30]  He used to shoot me.  Trying to get the police to shoot him.  Going through a divorce.  Lost both kids.  He was on the fast track.  Yeah, like, at 18, I was doing the same thing.  Too much, you know, booze.  I'm doing that now.  Wait a minute.  The girls are 18.  Oh, right.  But 18, you drink too much.  You act like an idiot.  All your friends are drunk, too. 
[03:43:00]  Some of them are complete asses.  But you even knew then that it was just, you were well beyond that.  Yeah.  Did you look at other people drinking and go, how come they can just kind of hang out and  have fun and I got to be like a jerk?  Yeah.  And they looked at me like there's something really wrong with you.  Like, don't give Jim anything to drink?  Yeah.  There was a problem.  Did you ever drink, like, just maybe a couple of beers?  Were you ever able to do that?  Occasionally, if I had no money.  And how did that work out for you? 
[03:43:30]  I wanted more.  Not good.  Not good.  Not good.  Not good for anyone.  Yeah, but everybody at 18 wants more.  And then you build your pyramid with your beer cans.  It's like, how bad were you that you, seriously, like, that always amazed me.  Like, guys who, you know, they clean up at 16.  Yeah.  It's like, I just knew at that point.  I don't even remember the eighth grade.  You know?  It's amazing to me.  I was a cutter.  I had to.  I knew I had to.  Yeah, yeah.  My father's one who stopped as well.  He kind of took me to certain places when I was young. 
[03:44:00]  And, you know, I knew.  You need, you're kind of a guy that needs all of his faculties about him at all times.  So you can just reason with yourself.  I can't handle mood or something.  How long did you booze for before?  A few years, man.  Four or five years.  But it was so.  Two months.  It was a good four or five years, though.  It really was.  They were Lulu's.  I mean, it was always an incident.  Good times.  Always an incident.  Where did your dad take you?  Well, just to certain meetings.  I won't say.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I was picturing morgues and stuff like that. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  But, I mean, I knew it existed and I knew it was a problem.  And I just knew it wasn't.  Yeah.  It was bad.  Yeah, I've been dead.  I'm lucky.  I'm very fortunate.  Yeah.  I didn't realize I had a problem until 36.  Was that it?  Yeah, I was on the Rich Bitch Tour and I was like, you know what?  You know, I just started drinking hard stuff and you're like, hmm.  This tastes good.  This works.  Rather than feeling like fire, it just, it's just like, ah, like that nice relaxed feeling.  You know, you don't go like, ah, like when the first time you take a shot of Jack Daniels, 
[03:45:00]  like, ah.  Yeah, that Three Amigos thing.  You got one leg up on the bar like Chevy Chase.  Yeah.  That was, yeah, I was just going down.  You were just kind of, ah, like iced tea.  Like you were drinking Snapple in a shot glass.  Like I fell backwards into a pool.  Yeah, a pool of whiskey taking the Jack Daniels plunge.  Yeah, that's when I was like, ah, I can stop this.  I know I can stop this.  Sure, any time.  Did you quit?  I actually, last month, I've really, I've shut it down. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, damn.  Oh, Bill.  You're a fun drinker, too.  Fun guy to go out and have some drinks with.  Yeah.  I was not a cutter.  I was definitely a drunk dialer.  All my buddies.  We'll call people up.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  Yeah, just slurring all over the place.  You know who the worst one of those is?  Is Eastside Dave from Rana Fez.  Holy jeez.  He gets drunk and just texts and it's incoherent babble that you get out of him.  And it's so damn funny. 
[03:46:00]  Mr. Anthony, drinking now.  Need you.  Like, that's what he'll say.  You'll be like, what do you need?  And he won't remember sending him the next day or anything.  I one time was reading a book about the Klan when I was like 17 or 18.  You know, and they just told him, Klan is wrong.  I mean, I still think it's wrong.  Look at you.  Your opinion changed?  Yeah.  But I looked up an information.  One of the guys who was like a Klan preacher actually got his phone number and called him and 
[03:46:30]  scolded him.  Ugh.  I know, but he's like, oh, I'm not even in the Klan anymore.  Do-gooder.  We actually had a chat.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Was he nice?  Where did the conversation go from there?  So, what are you up to now?  All right.  Well, don't rejoin.  I was in a partial blackout.  That's all I kind of remember.  Oh.  It was like I poked my head up out of the fog and went, oh, yeah, that chat happened.  How did you get his number?  How did you get his number?  411 or whatever.  However, that's many years ago.  I dialed whatever the information was. 
[03:47:00]  Right.  It was a Kentucky or wherever he was.  And his name was listed, huh?  Yeah.  His new last name was listed.  Was there a, I'm not sure if we talked about this before, but I don't remember.  So, was there a single instance that finally made you go, okay, all right?  No.  No?  It was just a culmination of a bunch of things and you finally just said, eh.  Yeah.  I can't believe I stayed stopped.  Did you ever fall off the wagon, like after you decided you were quitting?  No.  No?  You just quit and that was it?  I was forced into rehab when I was 17 after, you know, an incident.  Jesus.  Stitches needed.  Oh, Christ. 
[03:47:30]  It was all attention crap.  Me.  He was a goth girl.  You were a goth girl before his time.  You should have a straight black wig on.  I know.  Were you into the cure back then?  All in your eyes.  The cure.  Oh, I was such a tool.  It's embarrassing.  Please, please, though.  I love embarrassing Jimmy's stories because he's so different now.  You know, just like music. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, look at him.  He can't even do it.  I love this.  What kind of?  There's look at Jimmy.  Someone photoshopped Jimmy to look just like that.  It does.  Get that picture on ONA Radio.  Danny just popped up a goth kid that just has this pained look on his face and all this  red, like, makeup around his eyes.  It looks like a guy or a fat chick.  I would say guy, though.  Oh, yes, Danny?  The guys down the hall would dump out what I searched for to find that photo. 
[03:48:30]  Iran.  Oh, right.  Iran.  There's an F word that's not the norm that would...  Oh, okay.  All right.  I just remember, like, you know how you like a girl and you think, like, the music, you  associate yourself with it?  Ooh.  But, like, let's just say you liked a girl and you walked by her house and you made sure  a certain part of the song was playing as you carried your boombox.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Yeah.  You queued up a cassette tape.  Yeah, he queued it up to a box.  That's the perfect, perfect way to phrase it. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  What song?  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  Yeah.  I was, I don't know, I was drinking.  Oh, no.  What was it?  It might have been a live version of Iron Man from, I don't remember.  Oh, you're doing the badass.  What part of Iron Man?  Was it, I am Iron Man?  Because you were Iron Man.  I wasn't.  I was Flabby Boy.  You wanted to be Iron Man. 
[03:49:30]  I wasn't Iron Man.  So if she looked out the window, it goes, what's that?  Oh, look, it's Iron Man walking by.  Did you have any, like, uh, wait a minute, so maybe you were.  I am douche.  What's in the room?  Yeah.  Oh, everybody's a clap.  No, no, I've got to queue it up to the right spot.  If she hears this, she won't know it's Iron Man.  Which will ruin it.  He starts walking and then stops.  Wait a minute, that's too soon?  Okay.  Stop your head!  And I'll walk. 
[03:50:00]  Wait, I've got to start over.  Go to the end of the block again.  What?  This is the same version.  Yeah, yeah, this isn't the same version.  I mean, you're correct.  Here we go.  Did you throw some dry ice down on the ground?  Some smoke.  Have someone hold a light behind him, so.  Badass Jimmy coming down the street.  He's Iron Man.  Did this girl ever notice you?  He didn't say it in this one, this version.  No, he didn't say it. 
[03:50:30]  Jesus.  Sometimes he didn't back in the ages.  He should say it every time.  Nah, he...  What was he doing?  I don't know.  He shouldn't have said it back.  He didn't feel like he wanted to say it.  On any recording.  I got it.  It's funny.  Her name is Michelle.  And, uh, you know, I'm fine with it now.  But I got an email, I wish I remembered to contact her, from a friend of hers who knew  her, who knows her now, recently.  Oh, show her!  But she said she has, like, a letter or something I sent her, or something like that.  Get that letter.  Ooh, I bet that is douchey.  I told you one time I wanted her to, like, she was really hot. 
[03:51:00]  Mm.  And I had such a crush on her, and I wanted her to notice me, so I would send her, like,  love notes, and I put, like, an Aussie quote in it.  What Aussie quote fits into a love letter?  Not a lot of them.  Believe me, that keeps me from going back.  Do you know, I never had the balls to write a love letter.  Not like I didn't, you know, I don't even know if I ever wanted to, but I just would  never commit something like that into print, just for fear of ending up in the wrong hands. 
[03:51:30]  Wrote one.  I didn't give my real name.  Oh.  Oh!  If you want to know who I am, wear something tomorrow.  Like, on a certain scarf.  No way.  And she didn't wear it.  She did.  She did?  But that was, it's like, that's like, I don't know.  Ew, you creep.  I was going to say.  No, but when you're that age, that's not creepy.  You do that in your 20s, you're a pedophile.  Oh, yeah, but that was just, that was, I couldn't believe in a way that I had got her to,  like, there was a connection there, like.  Would you help me put this couch in the van? 
[03:52:00]  Would you?  Oh, God, you ghoul.  Was she, was she?  Was she disappointed?  Did she think it was, like, the quarterback or something like that?  Oh, she must have had, like, these thoughts in her head, like, oh, this has to be, oh,  finally my dream.  This is so mysterious, and it's going to be, like, this hot guy, and he's going to be cool.  She couldn't have thought that with the letter, with the maturity level of that letter.  Oh, really?  It was that bad?  But she was curious.  You know, she was in high school, but she was one of the hot girls in high school, so  no, she knew it. 
[03:52:30]  Any hot guy would have just talked to her.  She knew it had to be a mush, but I don't think she understood the level it went down to.  It would be funny if she set you up for some big Carrie moment, you know what I mean,  acts like you liked her.  Oh, yeah.  And the pig blood dumps on her head.  Dumps down on Jimmy.  I asked her out on the phone.  She said no.  Oh, God.  I told you about that.  Is that the one you gave her the choice?  I tried to, I'm like, you don't want to go out with me, do you?  Oh, right, right.  She's like, no.  No.  I was trying to be funny.  I'm like, well, I guess that's where the cookie bounces, like, instead of crumbles.  Oh, but you must have been feeling so, like, hot and flushed and sweaty when you had to 
[03:53:00]  say, well, I guess that's the way the cookie bounces.  Dude, I was eight.  I had no sense of irony.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, I suck.  I was humiliated.  Humiliated.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Jimmy's night.  It's terrible.  I literally would have jumped off my house.  I couldn't at that age. 
[03:53:30]  That kind of rejection like that?  I could not handle that.  There's no way.  I just couldn't handle that kind of rejection.  Hey, we got Jesse that wants in on this.  Jesse, what's up?  Danny laughs.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  I don't know if you've ever done anything as bad as this, though, but I was in, I think  it was middle school, like this girl, and I guess it was like, you know, late  80s, all those bad, goofy love songs.  I re-taped them with my voice, singing her name to them, and gave it to her.  Wow.  No, I never did that.  It's actually funny, too, because I bumped into her years later, and she was like, hey, 
[03:54:00]  remember when you gave me that tape, and I just turned it red and almost passed out  because she still remembered it.  See, I would love to get that stuff.  I think Michelle actually had some.  Her friend works in a, she MySpace, and I think, goddammit, I can't believe I dropped  the ball on that.  I should have contacted her and gotten, because it would be fun to talk to her now, like what  a nerd I was 20 years ago.  Someone knows Michelle.  They'll tell her today, I hope so, and she'll get a hold of you again, and you've got to  get that stuff in here, Jimmy.  Yeah, she had a brother.  I don't want to say her last name on the air, but she had a brother.  She lived in, ah, whatever. 
[03:54:30]  If you know who you are, it just caught you.  You know what I like about that early, like, you know, when you're first trying to pick  up girls, it's almost like when you first start doing open mics.  Like, I would just wish I had tapes of those, like the stuff that I thought would work.  Oh, god.  On stage.  It's the same thing.  Horrid.  Like that dude, like.  You don't wish I had it, Bill.  Well, I brought in a demo tape recently.  You don't wish I had it, Charlie.  Oh, I wish you would have seen that.  Oh, boy.  And we might have to pop it up there so we can see it.  Nah, that's all right.  That's all right.  Yeah, just horrific.  I wrote one letter, one love letter, and it wasn't even a love letter. 
[03:55:00]  It's worse than a love letter.  It's a please come back to me letter, like she was done with me, moved on to one of my  friends, and it just, it crushed me, just ugh.  Desperation is always attractive to the opposite side.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it was horrible.  And, yeah, I thought maybe this little letter with a poem in it would get it back.  What was the poem? 
[03:55:30]  Oh, I wish, you know something?  Honestly, I would tell you at least a line.  I don't even remember what I was trying to convey there.  I don't know.  Was it original or was it like a hacky, roses are red?  No, it was so hacky.  Yeah, it was a rhymy poem.  Um, I think there was something about, like, uh, us being meant for each other in a way  where, like, like, uh, uh, I was like the hand and she was the glove. 
[03:56:00]  Wow.  It was so bad.  She should have been the douche and you should have been the nozzle.  I was.  How awful.  How did the letter start?  Dear Eva.  It was so bad.  And then I even went another step.  I went into my garage with a Louisville slugger and tried to break my arm to get sympathy.  I thought if I had a cast on and came up with a good breaking my arm story that she would 
[03:56:30]  be like, oh, and come back to me.  Motherly instinct will kick in.  Yeah.  But I could, I, I could raise the bat up, but, and bring it down, but can never really  put, put commitment into it.  So I ended up with a big bruise on my arm.  Like a battered wife.  Yeah.  You always back off at the last minute.  I just couldn't go through it like they do in the movies.  I couldn't do it.  You take my 20% off the head at the last.  So that was that.  So I decided to chug down a bunch of booze and drive my Volkswagen through the woods 
[03:57:00]  until I hit a tree.  Really?  Oh, sure.  Nice.  Why didn't you just put a fake cast on you method actor?  Ah, brilliant.  You're going to lie about the story anyway.  Because then if she doesn't go for it, now you got to commit to it.  So it gets all four to six weeks or six to eight weeks of a cast.  Those awful plaster parrot, whatever the heck they had on your arm.  Remember you had watching her making out with my friend at the locker while I'm walking,  walking by with my cast.  That everyone's signing.  Hey, let's say how to Mark at Philly. 
[03:57:30]  Marky.  Oh, what a douche.  What do you got, Mark?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Good evening.  I have a rather embarrassing story.  I'd love to sit here and make fun of Jimmy, but I really can't knowing my history.  So back in seventh grade, I really, really had the hots for a girl in my group.  We sat at like the group tables.  And her boyfriend, who she was going out with, who was very popular for a couple years,  I decided to, he was going on vacation.  So I decided to write a fake, pretty much cursing her off and telling her she's a terrible person. 
[03:58:00]  And I put it in her locker from him, thinking for some reason that when she reads this letter,  she's going to be heartbroken and I will have a chance to jump in.  Well, obviously, the letter didn't work, and I'll never forget it.  One day at our group, we're writing a group assignment, and she looked at my handwriting,  looked at me, and a complete look of disgust when she realized that I wrote the letter.  And I got my ass beat.  You got busted like in the FBI. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  The first part of that phone call went through, right, where he wrote the letter as the boyfriend?  Yeah.  Okay.  It crept out in my headphones.  I wasn't sure.  Thank you, Mark.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Matt in Illinois, what's up?  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  Hey, Tom.  Gary?  Oh, we hear you, sir.  Back when I was in junior high, there was this fucking chick that I loved.  All right. 
[03:59:00]  You know what?  Now we're going to have to hold off on your little call because you said the F word.  And the quality of the phone was up.  He wrote a love note with a code book for a girl.  Ew.  Yeah, that's what he did.  Let's code one.  This sounds douchey.  Let's see how to Spiro on Long Island.  Spiro.  Good morning.  Hey, man.  I was about 18, and I was thinking of writing a ballad for this chick that I liked. 
[03:59:30]  Ballad?  A ballad?  What are you, Lennon?  No, he probably came up in the hair metal years.  Yeah.  Yes.  A power ballad.  Oh, yes.  Every bad boy has his soft side.  Dude, what was...  Do you remember any of it?  Oh, God.  I got inspiration for it on the toilet.  It's always a good place.  That's how you should have started the ballad. 
[04:00:00]  I'm looking down between my legs just thinking of you.  I actually got her...  I sang it to her, and I actually told her that I thought of it on the toilet, and that  was the end of that relationship.  Does that ever work?  That only works in, like, those plays.  Yeah, it doesn't work.  With a mandolin, and you just...  A song.  They're all, like... 
[04:00:30]  That worked before, like, radio, where, like, music was still amazing.  Yeah.  As opposed to, like, really accessible.  Mm-hmm.  I got an iPod, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  Please stop singing.  I really don't need you singing and serenading me.  Yeah.  I Need to Know by, like, uh...  Who is that?  Mark Anthony?  Is that who sings that?  J-Lo's Dumb Husband?  Oh, yeah.  That's a song you write for a girl if you like her.  It's a good song you can sing.  You gotta be talented.  Yeah.  First of all, if she's leaning out the window while you're playing the guitar and singing  to it, and you see earbuds in her ears, there's a problem. 
[04:01:00]  If your idea of songwriting is sitting on the bowl,  with your legs numb and a toilet seat wring on your ass, you're finished in romance.  Yeah.  If what's in the bowl is better than what's on the paper.  Yeah.  Just photograph that.  I don't know what rhymes with this.  Perhaps it.  Let's go to Bobby in Pennsylvania.  He's got more on his car crash thing.  Bobby.  Oh.  Hey, how you going, man?  All right, Bobby.  Hey, everyone else is talking about their junior high time,  but Anthony was driving when he did his douchey thing. 
[04:01:30]  Just how old were you?  Yeah, well, when I came back from California, I had my license at 15 out there.  You were able to get your license at 15, so I kind of just used that.  So I drove around with a California driver's license in New York when I was like...  Did you pull up to her house and you're Studebaker?  My Studebaker.  No, I had the worst car.  I had a Volkswagen Baja Bug.  It was one of those Volkswagens that it's kind of in between a Volkswagen and a dune buggy. 
[04:02:00]  It was one of those things that kind of the fenders were fiberglass  and the front was kind of fiberglass and the back, the engine was exposed,  had a cage around it.  Oh, is that what those were called?  Yeah, yeah, Baja Bug.  They used it in like the Baja 500 races and things like that.  One of those awful exhausts.  Yeah, yeah, that would stick up.  And so I had one of those.  I used to drive through the woods all the time.  It was fun.  And girls did kind of like it.  I would go out to the liquor store over there, get a bottle of something,  and then just drive into the woods and we'd hang out in the woods and drink. 
[04:02:30]  It was a nice, you know, safe place.  It wasn't on the side of the road.  No one else could get there unless they had a four-wheel drive or something.  So I used to go driving in the woods.  So when this girl, you know, I'm seeing her with my friend and I'm all pissed off.  I chugged down some beer and booze and stuff, went into the woods, tried to climb up this  big steep hill and rolled backwards and wasn't looking where I was going and hit a tree and  it hit the engine and just oil all over and the engine was done. 
[04:03:00]  I had to cut the tree down to get the car out the next day with a couple of my friends.  I'm hungover, heartbroken.  Again, my car is busted.  It sucked.  It's a bad weekend.  And I punched my windshield and it broke.  Bad day all around.  Bad day.  One more phone call before we say goodbye to Bill Burr.  We got Steve in Tennessee.  Steve.  So horrible.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I was going to call about, I gave a girl a cannonball.  We had a theme park that one of the rides was like Wabash Cannonball. 
[04:03:30]  I stole a cannonball and rolled it in the middle of church service.  It goes rolling right in the middle.  Everybody turned and looked at us and I left.  Only in Tennessee would you get a call from a guy that rolled a cannonball into a church  to impress a girl.  All right.  We'll try it.  We got to end on a good note.  It was a great sound effect.  Yeah.  Roll the cannonball.  Roll, roll, roll.  Sounded just like it.  You had the roll sound effect down. 
[04:04:00]  Dennis, what's going on?  You would be more...  Huh?  You there?  Can I hear you?  Yeah, let's go.  How are you guys?  Bill, pleasure as always.  Try breaking up with your girlfriend over the phone who's at college.  Driving up there, calling up six from work to find her sleeping with your best friend.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a nice one.  That's a good one.  That'll make you feel good.  I had a girlfriend that went to...  Yeah, that was...  That might be mine.  Jesus.  I went to a...  I was going out with a girl who went to Quinnipiac College and used to go up to visit her on 
[04:04:30]  the weekends.  Take the drive up.  Was she taking polls?  She was taking a Quinnipiac poll.  And went up to visit her on the weekends and stuff like that.  And, you know, we hung out, went to a dorm room, whatever.  And then, after a while, she was telling me, could you call before you come by?  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, yeah!  Okay!  What, you want to get dolled up?  Yeah.  You know, she wants to get all gussied up for me, I guess.  Yeah.  Could you just not drive up?  Could you give me a call, maybe, before you come up? 
[04:05:00]  Like, yeah, okay.  So, I'd call, and she'd be like, no, um, no, I got a lot to do this weekend.  I'm going to the Rush concert with my girlfriends.  Oh, okay.  And then I find out her girlfriends had a penis.  Yeah, well, who hasn't made that mistake?  This has been the O.P. and Anthony Show. </pre>
