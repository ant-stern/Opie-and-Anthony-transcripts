<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a significant discussion of Jimmy Norton's surprisingly popular, albeit brief, appearance in the new Spider-Man movie.  Norton, present in the studio, recounted his limited on-set improvisation, specifically his line "He stinks! I hate him!", which garnered an unexpectedly enthusiastic audience reaction. The hosts repeatedly highlighted this unexpected success.

This transitioned into a lengthy and offensive discussion about the Catholic priest sex abuse scandals, particularly focusing on Father Paul Shanley.  This segment included crude jokes and references to the predatory behavior, and featured the playing of a Stephen Lynch song satirizing a predatory priest.

A substantial portion of the broadcast detailed the upcoming "money snatch" segment scheduled for the following Wednesday.  This segment would involve completely nude women collecting money scattered throughout the studio.  The hosts extensively discussed the rules and the undisclosed, sexually suggestive "twist" of the contest.  "Stalker Patty," a caller, initially agreed to participate but later reconsidered after learning more about the twist, prompting a listener poll on foundrymusic.com to decide her participation.

A studio guest, Steve from foundrymusic.com, provided a positive review of the new Star Wars movie, praising the action sequences while downplaying the romance.  He also offered details on the Spider-Man movie, describing its short theatrical run before Star Wars.  The broadcast also included a review of the new Star Wars film, focusing on its graphic depictions of death, cool spaceships and battles, and minimized role of Jar Jar Binks.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a video clip, "Crinkle Duff," found by the hosts, showing what was described as inappropriate touching between men and a person with intellectual disabilities in a public restroom. This video was promised for upload to foundrymusic.com.  Another audio clip, "Darth Vulgar," was mentioned but deemed unusable due to excessive bleeping.  Mike Tyson audio clips were also played throughout the show, filled with his erratic and offensive commentary on various topics.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered on a phone call with Tom, a former employee who had recently resigned from their New Orleans radio station.  The hosts extensively discussed his departure, attributing the conflict to "New Guy."  The hosts speculated on the reasons behind his resignation,  played a farewell song ("I Will Remember You") for him, and his contributions were further discussed throughout the later part of the broadcast.  The show also promoted their upcoming ONA Celebrity Slash Bikini Softball Game, highlighting the over 4,000 tickets sold and Tom's participation as the first-pitch thrower. Details of the game, including the money-snatch contest, a midway with unusual attractions (like a Frenchie dunking booth and a Titanic slide), a potential "tussle booth," and live music, were discussed.

The hosts also announced their upcoming road trip to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and detailed listener contests involving bringing unusual items to their studio broadcasts in those cities, with prizes including a meet-and-greet with Kid Rock and a trip to a Poison concert.  Furthermore, a call to Linda Lovelace's sister, following Lovelace's death and reports of her family's inability to afford her burial, was made, resulting in an awkward and uncomfortable exchange, punctuated by technical difficulties.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You can act like a man! What's the matter with you?  It's Friday! Friday! Friday!  Take your bra off and take it off now!  What is the next thing?  I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing here. 
[00:00:30]  I'm not kidding!  Oh, yeah, you know me.  I'm not gonna get through this, but I just gotta keep your chin up.  Cancel your appointment!  I hate him! He stinks! 
[00:01:00]  I hate him! He stinks!  Says the surly truck driver.  I hate him! He stinks!  He stinks!  Our own little Jimmy.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Here in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  You have just tuned in to the most interactive radio show in America. 
[00:01:30]  Absolutely.  And if you're outside of New York City,  including...  Yes, yes.  Sacramento.  Goddamn you people in Sac!  The fine folks at KXOA.  I'm hearing things.  Finally, you guys are coming around.  Hearing things.  We've heard it for a while from the people.  They've been calling the emails and saying,  well, if they're listening, O.P.,  and everyone's around,  how come it ain't showing up in the ratings? 
[00:02:00]  Well, it's now showing up in the ratings.  It really is, Sacramento.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Yeah, so if you're in Sacramento  or anywhere else outside of New York City,  866-277-4WOW.  You know something?  I gotta start right now  by saying I cannot believe  on our show  is a little Jimmy Norton  and this is...  Jimmy, you gotta understand,  the Spider-Man movie?  It's getting ready for news.  It's gearing up to be  one of the biggest movies of all time.  Oh, cool. 
[00:02:30]  And our little Jimmy Norton's in it.  As the surly truck driver.  As the surly truck driver.  Who knew?  He drove trucks.  With a line.  He's got a line.  And it's one of your-like lines.  So there's no mistaking.  I hate him.  He stinks.  I hate him.  He stinks.  He stinks.  Or is it,  he stinks.  I hate him.  What was the line, Jimmy?  I don't remember.  I improvised it.  They told me to improv it.  Oh, what,  were you filming another blockbuster  and forgot what the line was  to this blockbuster?  I know,  because that's what we did a while ago. 
[00:03:00]  What, the Star Wars movie?  What's your line in that one?  No, I really don't remember.  They just said improv.  I answered like a bunch of questions.  And then they kept,  I guess, one line.  I don't remember.  We've been getting,  we've been getting emails and stuff  from people that have seen the screenings.  And one guy said he works  at a movie theater.  And of course,  when the movie theaters  get these huge movies in,  they get everybody that works  at the theater in,  and they're friends and whatever,  and they show the movie.  They get like a sneak preview.  One guy said,  when you hit the screen,  people went crazy in the theater 
[00:03:30]  when you said,  he stinks.  The whole,  he said the reaction from the audience  was the biggest in the whole movie.  Like, forget everyone else.  Lil' Jimmy Norton's line  and him,  his face on the screen  got the biggest reaction  in the whole goddamn movie.  He's killing with his line.  With his line.  He stinks.  He stinks.  I hate him.  Congratulations.  Look at that.  And a huge summer blockbuster.  The phones have exploded.  A lot of people have seen  Spider-Man so far.  It's more of a supporting role. 
[00:04:00]  Jeremy from D.C.,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jeremy.  I saw a screening last night.  I almost asked myself  when I saw Jim on the screen.  Now, what was the line he said?  Ah, God.  I think it was,  he stinks,  I hate him.  I think he said he stinks first.  He stinks.  I hate him.  I hate him.  He stinks.  Were you working very surly  by the truck?  Yeah, unloading boxes.  Were you unloading stuff?  Yeah, a method.  You know, I had the clothes on.  Right, sure.  Hey, Jeremy,  the big question,  how was the movie?  Oh, my God.  It was awesome. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, it's getting rave reviews  here in New York.  It really is getting rave reviews.  It's the best comic book movie  they've ever done.  That's not saying much,  but,  because most comic book movies  blow.  But this one,  really getting great reviews.  That's true.  All right, Jeremy,  thank you.  Hey, sure, no problem.  All right, another guy  that saw the movie already.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, I'm calling from Cleveland.  What the hell  is little Jimmy doing  in a Spider-Man movie?  Isn't that something?  I understand that  that's where the plot  really begins to.  The crowd went nuts  up in a balcony in Cleveland. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like,  Jimmy Norton,  I'm like, no way.  The crowd went nuts  in Cleveland?  Look, it's Norton.  Man, that rocks.  I wish they would have put  Lil Jimmy Norton  in the credits.  In the credits,  Lil L-I-L.  It's L-I-L.  With that Lil apostrophe.  Right after the first L.  Not to be confused  with Abner.  I want to have  Norton about the family.  That's cool, man.  And you like the movie?  Oh, it was great.  Yeah, that's where I'm here.  Of course.  Can't wait to see it this weekend.  Jim brings that  surly grittiness to it 
[00:05:30]  that it's so needed.  Yeah, I bring it down  to the street level.  Right, down to the street level.  You're keeping it real,  my friend.  Keeping it real.  All right, Matt, thank you.  A couple more of these  because a lot of people  have seen the movie already.  Sean, what's up?  Not much.  I was sitting in the theater.  You know, they're doing  this whole thing.  All the people are screaming  about Spider-Man.  All of a sudden,  Jimmy Norton pops up  and they go,  hey, look, kids,  it's the Gerber baby.  Yeah, that's a separated  birth for old Jimmy Norton.  All right, Sean, thank you.  No problem. 
[00:06:00]  One more.  Kyle from Connecticut  saying it's,  he stinks,  I hate him.  I died when he said  that he stinks.  That's very funny.  It's your line.  Jim, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Norton,  got to congratulate you.  Thanks, man.  That was awesome.  I couldn't believe it.  So, no longer  do you look ridiculous.  No, that's not  a ridiculous movie to be in.  Yeah.  No, not at all.  How fat and awful  does my head look on screen?  That's going to be  a nightmare.  Just huge, right?  Just before, yeah, 
[00:06:30]  the weak, chained, and awful.  You don't realize  how cool this is.  It's not like  you have one line  in Ghost Dad.  I mean, it's Spider-Man.  I'm freaking out.  I'm kind of like,  this puts you  on a whole other level  with me.  I don't know.  I don't know  if you can do  our radio show anymore.  I know.  I'm feeling like  the guy's a big...  There may be one line  in some other films  they may need.  Anything unloaded?  David, what's up?  It stinks a name  as he wanted  the funniest lines  in movie history.  Oh, thanks, man.  Funniest lines  in movie history.  One of them. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, thanks.  I cannot wait  until this is available  so we can get  the sound clip,  and I'm going to put it  right here next to  my godfather clips  and everything else  so that when it's appropriate,  I can hit the button  and you say,  he stinks.  I hate him.  I hate him.  I just, I hope  Paul Shanley went and saw it.  That's the really  important thing.  Is it?  Yeah, because he's my idol.  Important to you?  God bless him.  There you go.  Paul Shanley, I'm sorry.  Paul Shanley.  He was great in Kiss  and Father Shanley. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, Paul Shanley  from Kiss.  Raping little boys  during the intermissions.  Unbelievable.  Man, the priest  just cannot  catch a break.  When was the last news story  about a priest  doing something good?  Where's the father  that sent the little kids  to Boys Town?  You know,  that old movie.  This is just  story after story  about it.  One gets more horrific  than the next.  Now there's this guy, 
[00:08:00]  Father Shanley.  Paul Shanley.  Paul Shanley.  Paul Shanley.  Oh, I love  Paul Shanley  from Kiss.  Hello, boys.  Hey, little boys.  Come on  into the confessional.  I got my feather boa.  Flaming youth.  Yeah.  Paul Shanley.  Paul Shanley.  Paul Shanley.  And he was a priest  up there in Boston  where, you know,  Boston seems to be  the city where  all these guys  are really coming at him. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  They sure put out  some smooth lads up there.  They certainly do.  Those little hairless  Irish boys, right?  They must like them  like that.  Old cheruby red cheeks.  Yeah.  Father's drinking  so the kid's vulnerable.  Right.  The parents just looking  to send their kid  off to something.  Hey,  you'll go to church now.  Why don't you?  Sit on the father's lap.  Why don't you?  I'll be at the bar  with your mother.  You know,  and the little kid's  at the little kid.  He's there at the church 
[00:09:00]  with Paul Shanley.  And apparently he was  teaching classes  and he would take the kid,  one of the boys  or something,  out of the class  to the confessional,  to a basement area,  to the bathroom,  and just rape the kids.  Not even like  some of the other fathers  that you read about.  Who was the one guy  that said his hand slipped  and touched  the child's privates?  This is the worst.  Did he really say that? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah,  and this guy's been accused  of kissing the boys  and rubbing them  and sexual encounters.  And during one,  I guess they were interviewing  one of the kids  that this happened to,  now they're adults,  said,  yeah,  he touched me.  And the priest didn't deny it.  He just said,  well,  I was writing  on the desk  next to him  showing him something.  My hand slipped  and it touched  his area.  That happened to me once too,  but I was actually 
[00:10:00]  eating something  off the desk.  Just spooning something in.  My head slipped.  A little corn niblet fell  and I had to go get it.  Dig in,  get a good one.  And the one that's  invited the FCC ones  are all worried  about the language  on radio.  That's really good.  Uh-huh.  Yeah,  and it turns out  that they're going  to the bishops.  They're going  to the bishops  to clean up radio  and television.  Yeah.  Because that's  the problem.  We have to protect  the children  from shows like this  and TV shows. 
[00:10:30]  So,  the bishops now  are like,  what?  Oh, yeah!  Absolute,  we're right behind  this one.  Let's get all  the resources.  Let's get our  spokespeople  to get some  clips in the news  and the papers  about this.  They're ready  to jump on anything.  It's going to make  them look worse, too.  Of course.  Everybody knows  it's a diversion  and it's going to  make them look worse.  You can't now,  as the bishops  and priests  around this country  take up another  cause and try to  shuffle this off  into the background. 
[00:11:00]  Stories coming out  by the hour.  At least after  someone listens  to this show,  they can sit  comfortably,  you creeps.  Most people.  We've got to play  the ditty now,  man.  Oh, yeah.  Every time the priests  come up,  we've got to play  the Stephen Lynch song.  I love this one.  This one goes out  to the guy in Boston  there.  Paul Shanley.  Paul Shanley.  Flat out raping  the kids.  Right.  Not talking them  into anything.  Not even smooth  talking them.  There's a certain  honesty to Paul Shanley.  You've got to  respect, though.  This guy also  advocates sex 
[00:11:30]  between men and  boys.  He's had no problem  coming out and  saying this.  He was booted  out of the priesthood  for all allegations.  I guess he went  to San Diego  where he's going  to be extradited  back to Massachusetts  and face these  charges.  Well, for Paul Shanley,  check this out.  Stephen Lynch.  It's written from  the perspective of  a priest that I  knew many years  ago when I was  going through  some troubled times.  I went to him  for some advice  and love advice.  I'm sure he  helped you.  He helped me  out a great deal.  Not a person  anymore. 
[00:12:00]  Great.  Jesus.  Deep in prayer  my cross to bear  I kneel upon  the floor  Temptations  of a Catholic  priest  are easy  to ignore  But I cannot  control myself  It rips my  soul apart  For one small  sheep among

[00:20:30]  next Wednesday  we hit  on it  for a little  while  yesterday  you've seen  these before  it's where  a radio station  gets a bunch  of contestants  puts them  in a room  usually it's  just one  contestant  they put  them in  a bank  vault  put them  in that  glass tube  with air  blowing in  it  and there's  money  there's money  either on the  floor  or flying  around in  the air  and the  object is  they have  to grab  as much  cash  as they  can  whether  they grab  it off  the ground  or snatch  it out  of the air  whatever  it is  they've 
[00:21:00]  got to  grab  as much  money  as they  can  in some  limited  time  period  it's  been  done  we're  going  to  take  it  to  the  next  level  we're  going  to  get  about  seven  girls  at least  seven  girls  we're  going to  put  at least  one  thousand  dollars  in singles  all over  the floor  of this  studio  but I'm  thinking  we need  them  to reach  up  high  too  oh wait  you want  to suspend  some of  them  or maybe  put them  on top  of some  items  here  up on

[00:36:00]  it's gonna be awful though man  i mean the shirts are gonna be made  with the proper call letters on them  and the station will be on  and that's gonna be  what a nightmare new orleans is in for now  they'll actually keep the show on  yeah they might actually send a guy who's not in a blackout to pick us up from the airport  i don't even remember picking you guys up  maybe they'll change the promotion from whip it out wednesday to whip them out right  yeah you know little things like that 
[00:36:30]  you know i quit smoking pot and doing drugs almost uh... sixteen years ago and now they'll probably send a guy who won't blow pot smoke in my face  you know that's gonna be awful  it's not gonna be the same anymore actually  it sure isn't  run properly with decent human beings who wear ties to work  you'll never have to yell in new orleans  i'm an addict you idiot  you idiot  exactly it's what you want to yell in someone's face five minutes after you've been in the car after taking dramamine  the first time uh... norton met uh... tom he said uh... i hate him he stinks

[00:41:00]  you make a good point  cause we flew all night long  and this is the first impression we have of new orleans  the guy that's in charge  and  and the first listen of the station we're on down there  and there was static  static  that's classic  the first thing is static  and the guy that picks us up is is tom  he's got the mardi gras beads  he's towing a cooler with him  and his tongue is red from the hurricane drinks  or his voice would say it was mardi grass  that dummy  mardi grass  i got something with the tortilla wrapped around it  he's the only dumb jew in the country  there are no jews are smart  he's the only dumb jew  oh no they say he's got to go go go tortilla

[00:42:30]  steve from foundrymusic.com  uh... making his way into the studio to give us the review of the new star wars movie  yes  i'm sure you've heard by now uh... the spider-man movie getting huge reviews  little jimmy norton has a line in the new spider-man uh... movie  people ranting and raving  uh...  people freaking out in the theaters like when they uh... see jimmy they freak  they love little jimmy norton  yeah  chris in bridgeport writes norton was great in spider-man  he is credited as surly truck driver  what's next jimmy testy bellhop 
[00:43:00]  that's good  surly truck driver jimmy  yeah i'm hearing everybody that uh... goes to see the movie uh... in the areas we broadcast  it  just freak out when they see it  one guy said  he saw a screening  and  jimmy got the biggest reaction in the movie  like everyone went  everyone went  that's so cool  anthony before we go to steve  uh... let's go back to the money snatch thing real fast 
[00:43:30]  we gotta talk to stalker patty  at this time we need the ladies to call if they want to be part of this contest that goes  on next uh... wednesday right here in the studio in new york city  yeah  this is uh...  that's a little take off on one of those promotions where you put somebody in a bank vault with a bunch of money  and they have to grab up as much money as they can in a limited time  you've heard of those right everybody has  ours has a little twist  it's uh... only girls are allowed in this contest  and  they have to be  completely and utterly naked 
[00:44:00]  totally nude  not a stitch of clothing  that's our little twist on the whole thing  see? see how we made it our own?  oh and there's one more twist  right one more twist that uh...  we've been telling the girls on the phone  um... but we haven't been telling the audience  we haven't been broadcasting this  my mic gets shut off  all you hear is the girls reaction on the phone  to me explaining what this  final twist is  and it's been priceless  yeah  a lot of fun  and we added another uh... little twist to it today 
[00:44:30]  anthony we're gonna have some of the money hanging from the ceiling  so they have to jump up and down  jump up and down  oh how great is this gonna be on wednesday  nice  oh my god  now uh... patty called up yesterday  you know uh... stalker patty is uh... always  destitute  always in financial straits  she figured this would be a great opportunity to make some money  she's a little looser these days with herself  a little less shy  and she had no problem being completely naked  coming in here 
[00:45:00]  i then  turned my mic off  spoke to patty  told her the last twist  and she uh... said no she can't do that  and she is  broke  she needs this for rent or she's getting kicked out  that's pretty much it  so uh... she's calling back now and i think she's reconsidering  let's say hi to stalker patty  hi  patty  okay i can't talk too long  because i gotta get off the phone  someone else needs it  why  where are you  i'm at home  but yes i'll do it 
[00:45:30]  i'll see you wednesday  wait wait wait wait wait  wait wait wait wait  na na na na na na na na  Don't work like that.  It never works like that.  You can't just say that you're going to do it.  We offered you yesterday.  Yeah.  I thought about it, and since we don't have everybody yet, I thought I had a chance to call in and try again.  Patty.  Yeah.  Don't say anything about what the twist is, okay?  No.  But you do understand what the twist is. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, yeah, I do.  And you need money, so you're going to do this.  Well, there's a first time for everything.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  I don't know.  People always think whenever Patty gets involved in anything that has nudity in it, it kind of wrecks the contest.  Of course it does.  It could be the goof factor.  You know something? 
[00:46:30]  I think we can depend on some of the regular contestants being a goof factor.  It's not like we're going to get seven to ten real hotties.  I have an idea, Anthony.  I have an idea.  All right.  I need Steve's help from foundrymusic.com.  Uh-oh.  It does kill the mood, by the way.  Yeah, this is too big for us to decide.  I really think we allow the listeners to decide.  Okay.  Can you put up a poll?  Sure.  ASAP on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  Have people vote.  Mm-hmm.  Should Patty be allowed to do the money snatch? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  This coming Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show?  Put up a poll on foundrymusic.com.  Sure.  We will, Patty, and then we will accept the decision of the listeners.  Okay.  And you have to also accept that decision.  I can't stay on the phone now because now it's safe and someone's calling, and I've got to get off the phone, okay?  Nothing personal, Patty, but when there's a bunch of naked girls rolling a SIDS baby, it would not be as big a buzzkill as you being naked. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Don't give me an ironic chuckle.  All right.  It's evening.  All right.  Let's heal us.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to the foundling.  All right.  I've got to go.  Wait, wait, Patty?  Yeah.  It's just that I'm getting a lot of pressure to get off the phone.  Who's pressuring you?  Who's pressuring you?  I'm not the only person.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  We've got to ask you one other thing.  What was that term we learned today in the back office?  Trainable.  Yeah, she's trainable.  Are you a trainable?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  Yeah, we'll explain that in a minute.  All right.  Thank you, stalker Patty.  All right.  Patty?  Patty?  Yeah.  Twice.  She's not even fun with her.  She's not a trainable.  Of course you're going to get her.  How can you be a trainable if you fall for that?  Of course not.  Anyway, Anthony, so we'll put the poll up on foundrymusic.com.  Should Patty be part of the money snatch thing we do this coming Wednesday right here  in the studio in New York City?  It's F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Speaking of the guy that runs the website, Steve is in the studio.  Uh-huh. 
[00:48:30]  And he went and saw Star Wars last night, the new movie, eh?  The new one.  Now, you know the problems not only me and a lot of the Star Wars fans had with the last  one.  Uh-huh.  Lucas totally dropped the ball on the last one.  It was two cutesy little Anakin for this little go-kart race and Jar Jar Binks and dopey, oh,  I hated it.  The guy was out of the movie-making loop for 20 years and then he just decided to jump 
[00:49:00]  back in and it, you know, it was flat.  Well, you know something, when you got something like the original, right, the first one, when  you have the second one even, yeah, very cool, darker, yeah, nice.  Let's not forget Ewoks, Anthony.  That's the third one and it blew.  I'm still obliged to the third one that were okay, except for Darth Vader looking like Donald  Pleasance.  That was the only thing that really annoyed me.  Oh, he did.  You are the evil emperor.  At the end. 
[00:49:30]  You're a number one.  Donald Pleasance.  Very nice.  I hated that.  Well.  And then they go, all right, then he steps out of it for a couple of years, Jesus, 20,  and then comes back with the last one.  Episode one, which saw ha-ha-ha-ha-hucked.  Well, I don't know.  I wasn't that crazy about it.  I didn't hate it.  I thought it was very pretty to look at, very cool, but, you know, there were some  parts of it, Jar Jar and little Anakin, I wasn't happy with. 
[00:50:00]  I don't go to movies to look at pretty things.  Too cutesy.  When he hops in the ship and Anakin saves everyone.  Look, I'm flying the ship.  Oh, please stop it.  By the way, the first Star Wars, people forget the cantina scene sucked.  It did.  You're right.  You're right.  From the very beginning, he's been putting little wacky claymations in there and stop it.  You are right.  But you know something?  When you got a scene in the first one where Luke wheels up and sees his, what, aunt and  uncle on the fire? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  After the empire came rolling through?  That rocked.  Having to throw those little things on the fire?  Little Jawas on the fire.  The little Jawas throwing them on the fire?  That was pretty good.  As Rick falls down for no reason.  I know the reason.  No, I know the reason.  Oh, no.  Rick.  I got into work early today, 10, 30, 11, and Rick was already hitting the bottle.  Rick, what happened?  What's the matter, you Puerto Rican boob?  Rick, are you drunk that you fell down?  No.  What happened?  You just, look, you walked over to your chair and Steve is just looking as you in slow motion 
[00:51:00]  fell down.  What happened?  He just slammed the chair into my leg.  I was just very, uh, found, there's a bit I'm looking for that could add.  You are hammered.  I'm not.  Dude, you're hammered.  Ben and I, we're in the office.  I'm looking at him right now.  I didn't even notice.  Right around 11, and Lord knows we all know Ben likes to drink.  Ben looked down and I'm like, what is he doing?  It's 11 in the morning.  Jimmy imitates Ben.  It's a great visual. 
[00:51:30]  I love Ben.  Is that what I'm doing?  Yeah.  Ellen.  He walks down.  Jimmy's new thing, he walks down the street imitating Ben.  I love Ben.  That's brilliant.  That is friggin' brilliant.  I just can't get the bulge in the front big enough.  That mule.  Too bad it's another great visual for the radio.  Sorry, yeah, you're right.  It is funny, though.  Rick.  Rick.  What?  What is going on that you're drinking? 
[00:52:00]  He's stressing a little bit.  Friday stresses me out sometimes.  That's why it's not a good thing to have all that beer in the back of your office.  You know what it is?  It's right there.  You're slurring a little bit.  You are.  Slightly.  Is your sobriety merely a facade?  You know, false front?  Wow, okay.  Well, you know, I'm not going to...  What am I going to say?  Although I hadn't started yet.  All right.  Well, it's a quarter after four.  Okay, I'll take one.  Ben and I start laughing because it's not like Rick to do that.  We thought it was hilarious.  Yeah, this is twice in about a month. 
[00:52:30]  I'll give you a month.  We know way too much about each other.  Anyway, he's finding something.  When he's not falling down.  When he's not falling down.  That is so funny.  He's trying to find one of our classic bits, the Darth Vulgar.  Ah.  That's been made into short films and everything all over the internet.  On the internet.  But anyway, getting back to Star Wars with Steve.  Yeah, so now this one comes out.  Steve sees a preview.  Yeah.  And from some of the trailers I've seen, it looked very good.  I was a little disturbed by one trailer.  It made it look like the main plot line was the love story between Anakin and little princess Amidala. 
[00:53:00]  No, not even remotely.  Okay.  First of all, this was the most highly secure preview I have ever seen.  I mean, there were four separate checkpoints that we had to go through with our numbered tickets.  Yet explosives get into the Cleveland airport today.  Bravo.  I didn't hear that.  What happened?  Well, some alarm went off on a machine that it detected explosives in someone's carry-on bag.  And the person behind there didn't notice. 
[00:53:30]  Go ahead.  Keep going.  Ugh.  Were they trying to get them on the plane?  And then about 15 minutes later, they realized one of the blinking lights on the machine meant  explosives.  And they had to take everybody off of every plane.  Did they get the person?  I don't know.  It takes hours to sort through that.  They had to get everyone off of planes.  If the plane was there ready, you know, for clearance to take off, it had to turn around  back to the terminal.  Everyone get off the planes with their carry-ons, back through a security x-ray, everything again. 
[00:54:00]  Amazing the stupidity of some of these people.  The incompetence with these security people.  Yet at the Star Wars premiere, 20th Century Fox people everywhere.  Our tickets are numbered with the times that we have to show up.  Let's put them in charge.  Yeah.  Give them lightsabers.  Put them in charge, man.  We're doomed.  I got two good ones today.  Very, very tight security.  I mean, normally at these previews, they hand out three times as many tickets as they need 
[00:54:30]  for these things.  Yeah.  Because not everybody's going to show up.  They held, it was at the Zekefield down on 54th, and they handed out as many tickets  as the Zekefield would hold, and no more.  That's it.  All numbered, and you had to go through.  Within every 20 feet before you got in the door, there was a checkpoint.  And they checked your tickets, made sure you had a valid number, and the time to show  up, and then they let you through to the next checkpoint.  Wow.  And on and on and on.  And they made it very clear that you were not to tape, tape record, or videotape anything  in the movie theater. 
[00:55:00]  They even had people sitting in the rows from 20th Century Fox to monitor.  Really?  What people were doing.  They just didn't want anyone taping, hey, Anakin, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Feel the energy, people.  You're 50% of this.  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, all I was doing was taking notes, and I even had a guy peering over my shoulder  for a half an hour.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe he just liked you.  Maybe.  Lebanese handwriting.  Oh, it's Lebanese and Italian, but yeah.  So, now, yeah, okay, but Star Wars kicks up. 
[00:55:30]  Are we going to get, now, believe me, six inches fat, believe me, you're, looks like  a little angry Tasmanian devil.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Now, believe me, we're not giving anything away.  Give it away!  Who cares?  No, you know something?  No, because I want to see the goddamn thing, so shut up.  All right.  Don't give any, don't give any, don't give any, all our listeners will tune out. 
[00:56:00]  All I'm saying is, I just want to know a few things.  The opening, is it something big, something cool, as the, the opening of the movie?  Yeah.  It's, all right.  Action?  Yeah, there's action, there's action all over the movie.  It's not really, I mean, you know, George Lucas learned his lesson from that last movie.  He better have, because it sucked.  Yeah, he really did.  This is, that love story that you were mentioning, between Anakin and Natalie Portman's character,  it's just a subplot, it's there.  Sure, it exists, but it's not the main focus of the story. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  What is?  I'm not going to say.  I'm not going to say.  Is it a good movie?  Yes!  Extremely.  Go see it.  A lot of Star Wars fans want to know a little more, but not, you know.  I don't know if they want to know too much.  I think they want to know, as far as, uh, uh, spaceships?  Yes.  And fighting.  That's what I like in my Star Wars movies.  Think Braveheart with lightsabers.  Very, very cool.  I'm sold.  I'm sold right there.  Braveheart with lightsabers.  Epic, sweeping battle scenes with 60, 50, 60 Jedi's running towards a whole bunch of droids 
[00:57:00]  with their lightsabers out, bouncing and flipping all over the place.  Yeah.  Wow.  Um, guys getting, yeah, shut up.  You're the only person who's going to react to that negatively.  That sounds awful.  Wrong.  Stop it.  People are going to see Spider-Man 2.  All right.  Oh, what are they hoping?  What were you hoping?  What do you think of Darth Vader?  I don't like him.  He stinks.  He stinks.  As he's unloading something with some anti-gravity device off a spaceship.  Surly space trucker.  Surly stormtrooper. 
[00:57:30]  I am an ass with a weak chin.  I apologize.  Good.  Lots of fighting.  Lots of fighting.  Do we get graphic depictions of death?  Yes.  Very much so.  That's what I like.  A lot of anger.  A lot of people getting run through with lightsabers.  Heads getting cut off.  People getting dismembered.  Very cool battle scenes.  Okay.  And now about the spacecraft.  Cool looking spacecraft.  Yes.  Very cool looking spacecraft.  Some good space battles.  A lot of dog fighting.  A lot of shooting.  I'm sold.  That's what I want.  Good.  Thank you.  Hold on. 
[00:58:00]  That's all.  What?  Jar Jar.  Jar Jar.  Oh.  Very good question.  Five minutes.  Maybe in the movie and very scant amounts of dialogue.  Like background characters somewhere in the scene.  Background character.  Thank God.  Although he should have been one to get just minced with a lightsaber.  Was he in the first one?  I didn't see.  Oh my God.  He was in it and it destroyed the crappiness in the movie anyway.  Even made it crappier.  I didn't buy that just to enjoy watching.  Awful.  Self-destruct.  Jim, you didn't see the last Star Wars.  I hadn't.  No.  I liked the first two Star Wars. 
[00:58:30]  Third one was like, I didn't care enough.  I heard about Jar Jar Binks.  I heard about Lucas' cute characters.  I'm not wasting my money just to do it.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Oh, what happened?  Did the death guy come?  Who cares?  It's on American.  I don't care.  How was Samuel L. Jackson?  Very cool.  Yeah?  Very cool.  He's this cool Jedi character.  It's the one that says bad mother effa.  Yeah.  Is it true that on Ron and Fez you said Yoda made his heart sing?  No, that was Jeff.  Jeff was full of homo comments last night. 
[00:59:00]  Oh my God.  Yeah, Jeff.  What is that about?  Jeff with the beard?  Yeah.  What did he say about Yoda?  He's puking at the boobie bar, Jeff?  Yeah, puking at the boobie bar, Jeff.  Passing out in the car, Jeff?  I've got to thank Jeff because he was the reason I was able to go see that preview,  but he was filled with asinine comments last night that just made me want to walk away.  Like Yoda made my heart sing?  No, he said the whole movie made his heart sing.  There's a scene with Yoda.  How does your heart sing?  I think he was just happy that it was a good movie.  Was he joking?  God, I hope so.  I really hope so.  That's into Jeff's.  Did he feel good? 
[00:59:30]  Was it a feel-good movie?  Well, you know something, dude?  There were a lot of 40-year-old industry types at this movie high-fiving and hooting and hollering  at that movie.  So, I mean, it was very...  He should have went to Paul Shanley.  It would have made his mule sing.  Wow, nice callback.  How many stars, Steve?  How many stars?  Oh, how many do you give it out of?  Spider-Man is getting like three and a half in the New York paper today.  Spider-Man will do well for the two weeks it's out before Star Wars and then goodbye.  Oh, is that what they're banking on?  Yeah, exactly.  Even with the star power of Jimmy Norton?  Even with Jimmy Norton's little star power, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Spider-Man's got two weeks to make a couple hundred million and then Star Wars, that's it.  What do you think?  Star Wars' biggest opening in movie history?  Yeah, I think so.  Do you see that?  No way.  Absolutely.  As the biggest opening in movie history?  This thing is already going to get such a buzz going.  What do you see as the biggest opening in movie history, Jimmy?  I say that Spider-Man, you know...  Surly Trucker?  Yeah, that's a big, that's a big, that crucial point for the plot from over here.  Where was that film, by the way?  Exactly.  Um, Queens. 
[01:00:30]  It was in Queens?  They were shot in Queens, the second unit.  I didn't even meet Sam Raimi.  No.  You should sign the sidewalk where you did the scene.  I don't remember, actually.  I know I drove in and they put me with the extras.  They did.  So I'm like, we don't provide parking.  Because she didn't know I had lines.  Ah, that bitch.  Yeah.  You had a line, though.  Well, she didn't know that.  Look at him getting the attitude.  I had told her, I have a line in this lady.  What's wrong with the terminology for that?  Like, you know, I didn't know what to say.  Like, I have talkie part.  I didn't know what to say.  I have a talkie part.  No, me have lines.  I have walkie and talkie. 
[01:01:00]  Walkie and talkie.  Yeah.  All right.  So a thumbs up for the new Star Wars movie.  Oh, definitely.  That sounds great.  Because that's all I care about.  I want a lot of gory, bloody battle scenes.  And I want good spaceships.  Yeah.  Good say.  I was going to say, but how's the story?  Story's cool.  Story's cool.  Just, you get to find out why Anakin Skywalker is so bitter and how he becomes Darth Vader.  There's a lot of really cool moments where you see how bitter this kid is and how angry he is.  Especially one scene when you find out what happens to his mother.  And I'm not going to say what. 
[01:01:30]  All right, good.  I'm not going to say what.  All right, cool.  Also, while we have you in here.  Is he wearing a hat?  The little Darth hat?  No.  Geez, Jim, relax.  I'm going to go see Spider-Man on Saturday.  I'll give you your props.  I'm just going to say this is a good movie.  Those guys standing up in line driving me.  I'll ask you to probably see when it's gone.  You know something?  There was people camped out outside the Ziegfeld last night asking to buy tickets.  There were literally tents all over 54th.  Doesn't that make you just want to pick up a flamethrower and attack people?  What's wrong with you?  If you're outside and you're waiting to see a film, I don't care what film it is. 
[01:02:00]  I don't care if it's the Jim Norton life story.  You stink.  Get back in your house and just wait in line and go, oh, we can't go.  And go home and bang your girlfriend.  Bunch of creeps.  You bunch of effing creeps.  That aggravates me so much.  They should all be dragged into a confessional and taught a lesson.  Jesus.  Before we get Steve out of here, Anthony, is that clip going to be up soon?  I'm working on it, yeah.  Effing DVD copy protection crap is making me nuts.  We found, or I should say Anthony found, 30 seconds of some of the funniest ass you'll ever see. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, we were laughing our balls off in the back office.  It's a visual, obviously, so we just handed it right over to Steve, and it'll be up on foundrymusic.com.  Do you want to explain quickly?  It's a whole thing on retards and sex.  How do you explain sex to retards?  It looks to be the late 60s, early 70s.  And it's just horrific.  And at one point, they show a bathroom scene, and the narrator is talking about how retarded people should be taught not to be taken advantage of sexually. 
[01:03:00]  So the retard guy is at the urinal.  Next to him to his left is another guy, and next to him is another guy on the left.  And the guy in the middle reaches up slowly.  You see his arms start to move.  He reaches over and starts rubbing the retards back as they're all taking a leak at the urinal. 
[01:03:30]  It is the funniest goddamn 30 seconds of video I've ever seen in my life.  It's called Crinkle Duff.  Sorry.  Rubbing, rubbing.  The things to look for, look how uncomfortable the retard is, how he moves completely over to the right side of the urinal,  because there's little barriers in between the urinals.  And the guy is reaching his hand around and rubbing his back.  He can't get further enough away from the guy as he's trying to complete what he's doing.  And the guy that's just in there, the innocent bystander, he turns his head and just starts looking and has a, 
[01:04:00]  what the F is going on look on his face.  Brilliant, brilliant video.  And the thing is, you never start off rubbing somebody's back.  You just go right for the mule.  Right for the mule.  Hey, can I hold that thick one for you?  Yeah, it's got like little, little hairs like pig's tails.  I'll never forget the one retarded guy in our school when we were all young and went to camp.  He was the only one that had gone through puberty because he, you know.  He had some body hair. 
[01:04:30]  It looked like a fire plug with pig's tails around it.  That's what it looked like.  Oh!  Curly cute pig tails.  He was like 30.  A big retarded one, though?  Yeah, yeah, just thick and angry and probably never went down.  Like their tongues, just big and fat.  No, no, no.  He wasn't.  Unwieldy.  He didn't have downs.  He was just, he was just the slow kid.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, then it wasn't that big.  It was pretty delicious looking, though.  I mean.  So, uh, that video will be up later on tonight or sometime this weekend. 
[01:05:00]  I'll figure out your music.com.  Great.  All right.  Also, we were going to play the Darth Vulgar.  That scene, by the way, made my heart sing when I saw it.  Yeah.  We were going to play the Darth Vulgar thing, Anthony, but, uh, the people, the sea suckers  that are trying their hardest to ruin the O&A show messed up the bit.  It's not funny anymore.  Yeah, it blows now because the beeps have to be too long.  They beeped it to the point.  It sucks.  So, uh, what we could do is, uh, give the original version to Steve and maybe he'll put that  up on foundrymusic.com as well.  Right.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  When we get back, we'll try to get more girls for the money snatch thing that goes down Wednesday  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Give us a call if you want in.  877-692-1027.  If you're in the New York area, outside of New York, it's 866-2774.  Wow.  We have, uh, five spots left, Dan?  Five spots.  Right.  Oh, and also, um, uh, when you go to foundrymusic.com this weekend, you got to vote and decide  if, uh, we should allow Stalker Patty to do the money snatch thing.  Yes.  A poll is going up as we speak.  Opie, Opie, Opie, and Anthony, Anthony. 
[01:06:00]  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:06:30]  Today, it's a cart machine.  Yes.  Today, it's a cart machine.  It isn't A or B.  It's a cart machine.  Cart six went kablooey.  Kablooey?  Kablooey.  Where the hell is Pete?  Is this cartoon kablooey?  Where the hell is Pete the Engineer? 
[01:07:00]  He has some work to do.  Ha ha!  Yeah.  A couple phone numbers in New York or the New York area.  We love New York.  Ha ha!  877-692-1027.  This is POD, by the way.  Boom.  Elsewhere, outside of the New York area, 866-277-4WOW.  We've got to try to get more contestants for the money snatch game, Anthony.  Yes, money snatch.  It goes down Wednesday next week before we hit the road.  Yeah.  It's going to look insane in this studio. 
[01:07:30]  It is going to look crazy.  Up to 10 completely nude girls just jumping around, bending over for the money, like grabbing  it on the floor, jumping up for the money we have suspended from the ceiling, things like  that.  Going to stick some around the walls.  Yeah.  Maybe you tie a dollar bill around your mule.  Ha ha ha ha.  Go get it. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  You've heard of this stuff before.  It's like the vault thing.  But this is an extra twist on it.  The girls are naked.  And there's that other special secret twist that is in this game.  And they have to agree to all twists or they can't do the game.  Got to agree.  We've got three girls that will definitely do it.  Yesterday, five girls said no to the second twist, Anthony.  They could not do the second twist to get in this game.  Yeah.  So today, we go back to the phones and see if we can get some more ladies. 
[01:08:30]  Lauren.  Hi.  Hi.  How old are you, Lauren?  I'm 25.  Very good.  And you would like to participate in the money snatch?  Possibly.  Possibly.  Yeah.  Anthony's money snatch.  Now, from what you've heard on the air, you're comfortable with being completely naked in a room full of other naked girls and some of us here in the studio?  Sure.  Sounds like fun.  Completely nude.  Okay.  All right.  Do you need money?  Over $1,000 in fresh $1 bills all over the studio. 
[01:09:00]  Uh-huh.  Did we explain how the prize will go?  At least we'll be fresh.  Get how this prize works out.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  All the girls are going to gather up the cash, right?  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  And at the end of the time period, the girl that has the most money will then get all the money that is remaining on the floor.  And on the ceiling.  And on the walls.  Wherever the money is.  And on Jim Norton's pants.  All the other girls, they get to keep whatever money they were able to gather up. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  All right.  And the completely naked thing doesn't bother you.  But then there's this other twist that I will tell you.  You will not hear my voice on the air, but you will hear Lauren's reaction to this last twist.  Please, Lauren, don't repeat it.  Okay.  Because we don't want everybody in on the secret.  Don't give it away.  Don't give it away now.  All right.  All right.  I'll try not to.  I lower Anthony's mic so he can talk to Lauren.  And we put on some music.  And Anthony is now talking to Lauren. 
[01:10:00]  We'll hear Lauren's reactions.  Hi.  Yes, I can hear you fine.  Nope.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  All the time.  All the time.  Every day.  Every day. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I knew that.  Yeah.  Well, that would work, too.  No.  Yeah.  I think we have another contestant. 
[01:11:00]  Lauren, you have no problem with what Anthony just told you.  No, no.  Wow.  Now, look, if you're BSing us, you've got to let us know, because there's so many ladies  that want to do this for us.  No, I knew that's what it was going to be.  Wow.  And you have no problem, right?  You know, I've got to say, when we do things just for ladies, a lot of times you ladies  will come on the air and say, ah, no problem, no problem, I'll do it, blah, blah, blah.  And then you either don't show or you come down and then get cold.  Or they say, wait a minute, I didn't know that this was part of it.  Right, so you know. 
[01:11:30]  I mean, if you have any reservations, thank you, Anthony, you've got to tell us.  Okay, no.  Okay.  Well, hold on, and someone will grab your info.  Okay, sounds good.  All right, Lauren, our fourth contestant for the Opie and Anthony Money Snatch game that's  going down Wednesday of next week.  How about that?  Want to try another one, Ed?  All right.  Let's go to Helena.  Helena.  Hi.  What's up?  How are you?  How old are you?  Twenty-nine.  Twenty-nine.  Yes.  Yeah, baby.  You've been listening the last couple of days? 
[01:12:00]  Raise the roof.  Hey, hi, hi.  Hi.  Hey.  Hi, Helena.  What's going on?  So, you've been listening the last couple of days?  Not a couple of days, no, just today.  I'm sorry.  Really?  Yeah.  Hold the phone.  We've got an African princess on the line.  Now you know I'm African.  Yeah.  That's it, baby.  All right, baby.  Now, you haven't been listening?  And I think she's a cafe latte, Anthony.  How dark are you? 
[01:12:30]  I'm not dark.  I'm light.  Actually, I'll tell you who I am.  I don't know if you remember me, but I'm the bikini mom from what my mom would do for  Britney Spears tickets.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, what'd she do for us?  I don't know.  You know, and I dressed up in the wild bikini.  You know, I put all the bikini stickers around me as a bikini.  And you walked around 42nd Street.  Yes.  Some junk in the trunk.  Yeah, you got a little junk in your trunk.  That's me, guys. 
[01:13:00]  Can I get in or what?  Can I get in or what?  Can I get in or what?  Yeah.  I like me.  Yeah.  Um, well, Helena.  Yes.  You know this is complete and total nudity.  Yes, I heard.  You got no problem with that?  No, I don't have a problem with that.  Now, there's another twist.  Yes.  This is what I'm curious about.  I bet you're curious.  We're going to tell you about it.  All right.  All right.  I lower Anthony's mic. 
[01:13:30]  Put the music on.  And now, uh, Anthony is talking to Helena.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Am I, um, I'm content with it, yes.  Is it sloppy?  What do you consider sloppy?  Hey, hey, don't give too much away, then.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  We don't know what Ann's asking, so. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  No, no.  Yes, I do.  There should be nothing more than nine.  It's having a little too much fun over there. 
[01:14:30]  Why is it taking Ann so long to tell her the second twist?  Anything, uh, that's anything particular?  Um, let's see if I said that, I might give away the question, but, um, I don't know if  you're familiar with, um, plantains.  It's, you know, um, yellow plantains, or like a, a banana, you know? 
[01:15:00]  I have no idea what Ann's asking.  All right, I didn't get to the twist right now.  What are you doing?  Jim, stop.  Yes.  All right, here comes the question, I think.  Okay, shoot.  Mm-hmm.  Now, how do you go about doing that? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, that's my problem.  Oh, um, okay.  All right, Opie, I have talked to her, um, and now she'll give her answer.  Without, without letting anyone in on what I just told you, um, what, uh, what's your answer?  Um, I'll give it a shot, why not?  Well, now you sound a little bit...  No, no, no, if I said I'll do it, I'll do it.  All right.  What do you think?  A little wishy-washy?  Yeah.  I'm not wishy-washy, guys. 
[01:16:00]  She has been down here before, so that's a plus.  That is a plus.  She knows the scene.  Wow.  And you have been naked for us before.  Yes.  Um, man, we need, these girls cannot back out on that.  No, I wouldn't back out.  If I said I'll be there, I'll be there.  I believe her.  I believe her.  All right, contestant number five, Helena.  All right, thank you, guys.  Bring a plantain with you.  Okay, I want to show you.  All right.  I don't know what a plantation is, but a plantain.  All right, hold on.  Plantain.  You want to try one more?  All right, let's, let's try one more. 
[01:16:30]  One more for now.  Let's go to, uh, Heather.  Heather.  Hi.  Heather, the feather.  No, it's not Heather, the feather, right?  Oh, no, no, no.  Heather, how old are you?  I'm 27.  I'm 27.  27.  And, uh, describe yourself a little to the audience.  Oh, my God.  I'm 5'7", about 135 pounds.  Can I interrupt for a second?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Joey Big Arms from Jersey is brilliant.  He just writes on the instant feedback, does Infinity Broadcasting think we're all a bunch  of alcoholics? 
[01:17:00]  Now, there's someone that listens to the entire show.  Right.  Thank you, Joey.  All right, go ahead, Heather.  Heather, uh, yeah, describe yourself a little.  I just did.  Uh, we didn't hear.  5'7", and, uh...  135.  Oh, 135.  Dirty blonde hair.  27.  Mm-hmm.  That's about it.  Yep.  All right.  Would you consider your, do you have a big ass or big cans?  Are you big through the hips?  Not big cans?  I have, they're decent, I think.  All right, just trying to get a little, uh... 
[01:17:30]  Oh, okay, all right.  All right, I'm hearing a little attitude.  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, no, no, no.  This is a very special game, the Opie and Anthony money snatch.  You all right?  Oh, wow.  Am I?  Uh, hold on, Heather.  I don't know how long we can hold this guy in line, but...  Breaking news, hold on.  On line seven, Matt is a projectionist, and he has Norton's line ready to go from the movie.  Hey, Matt.  Yeah, you're too late.  Missed it.  God damn it, while you're playing the movie? 
[01:18:00]  Yes, I'm playing the movie right now.  I'm up here.  Place Bellingham 14, exit 18 off of 495, Bellingham, Massachusetts.  Damn it.  I knew we couldn't go to him soon enough.  I tried.  Any projectionists?  All right, so don't worry.  It'll happen again, and I'll call you guys back.  Just this time, don't take so goddamn long.  Would you have held up a tape recorder, Angel Face, and then just played it?  Uh, I don't have a tape recorder, man.  No, no, no, I'm not saying you should do that, Sweet C. I'm just saying it's with a possibility.  Hey, Matt, Matt, give us a little audio of the movie.  All right, good. 
[01:18:30]  How do you see the movie?  A little bit.  One, two, one.  Shut up.  Right now, I'm up in the projection booth.  You can hear the projector going.  Yeah, all right.  All right, well, thanks for trying, Matt.  All right, I'll call you guys back later, all right?  All right, try it again.  Sounds like it's going to be a couple of hours.  I know.  Maybe he works in a multiplex or something.  Yeah, Matt was going to play the Jim Norton line from Spider-Man for us.  Damn it.  All right, let's go back to Heather.  The O&A Money Snatch Game. 
[01:19:00]  All right, Heather.  All right.  Hey.  All right, now I'm going to tell you the little twist.  You have, first of all, no problem being naked in a room with a bunch of people.  Heather?  Um, no.  You have to be completely naked.  I hear you.  All right, let me tell her the twist real quick, because it doesn't sound like she's  going to go for this.  All right, let me hear.  Oh, boy.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  What? 
[01:19:30]  Okay.  No, I have no idea.  What is this?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, why?  Okay.  Oh, and you, and...  Okay, I get it.  I get it.  I get it. 
[01:20:00]  Um, perhaps.  Perhaps.  All right.  Opie, Opie, um...  I don't, I don't, I don't, Heather, um, I don't know.  I love you guys.  You guys rule, but I don't, I don't know.  Thank you, Heather.  Yes, I understand.  We need, uh, girls that are...  Yeah, that are no problem with this.  Gung-ho for this.  So, thanks for being on.  I hear you.  Thank you, though, Heather.  All right.  All right.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Was she a great, big, fat person?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She was a large girl. 
[01:20:30]  All right, thank you, Heather.  So, she said, perhaps.  She's a great, big, fat person.  Perhaps.  She will not do the, uh, the extra twist there, Anthony.  No.  As we do the O&A Money Snatch this coming Wednesday on the show.  Uh, Tom.  Andy.  Hey, Tom.  How you doing?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  We're doing a lot of fun.  How you guys doing?  Yeah, you...  We're pouring in, Andy!  I got Andy, Andy from Dance for Brock.  This dude is so wild, dude. 
[01:21:00]  He was like the, uh, LSU band.  What, I got to stand away?  Why?  Why do I have to stand away?  This is not your accent.  I'm not in fashion.  What the hell is...  He is so drunk.  He is so drunk.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad, Andy.  I can't believe you were fired.  This is Andy.  Is this Opie or Anthony?  Which one is this?  Hey, you bastard.  You better answer me.  This is one of Tom's good freaking friends. 
[01:21:30]  You're right.  And we're having a good mother freaking time down here, man.  And I don't appreciate the accent that y'all give him.  With an I declare...  That is so far from what he's got.  That's the greatest fun.  That's the greatest fun, all right?  What the jazz says.  Jazz rip rock.  All right, you be good.  He's kind of crazy. 
[01:22:00]  He's kind of crazy.  Can we beep that out?  Get that, Richard.  Who is...  No, no.  Who is...  Who is going to get that?  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed. 
[01:22:30]  Ed.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  Is there anyone in New Orleans who isn't an ass?  I cannot believe he was forced to hand in his retirement.  I can't believe it.  Such a force like that and a liver like a macadamia nut.  Where's the cabbie that used to call it?  He was cool, right?  He was a normal dude.  It sounded like it.  He called earlier. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, Tom from New Orleans was...  He says he resigned.  We're hearing he got fired from the station down there.  He didn't get fired.  He didn't get fired.  Let me tell you.  He didn't get fired.  All right, for the fifth time, who are you?  This is Tom Foyant.  Oh, the lovely Mississippi.  What's your shirt on, man?  This is the lovely Sherry.  All right, Sherry, what happened to Tom?  Let's just say that there was, you know, without stepping on his toes,  there was somebody that came in that just had a different style and philosophy of sales. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, like keeping a station on the air.  You mean the boss didn't like sterno drinking during office hours?  None of that.  And like, you know, like his ass squeaked when he walked because his ass was so tight.  Stuff like that, you know.  He's really a tight ass.  I thought you were very sexy in New Orleans, by the way.  It's Jim.  Oh, thank you.  You should see me now.  Why?  Is your rack hanging out?  It could be.  Nice.  These two are unbelievable.  Woo! 
[01:24:00]  Let's go.  I miss you guys, though.  I'm looking forward to coming up for the softball game.  Yeah, we're going to have Tom throw out the first pitch.  Lee's wife's hot.  Not.  Hey, Tom, when you're trying to fall asleep, do you count detoxes?  No.  You want to talk to Tom again?  Oh, not really.  No, not really.  I want to ask him something.  Yeah, we want to ask him something there.  I don't know.  Okay, I love you guys.  I'll see you soon.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'm going to give you Tom.  Wait, wait, wait.  What? 
[01:24:30]  You've got to take a break.  I just want to rub Tom's back in the urinal.  Yeah, you know, as you're at the urinal, you just reach over, start rubbing his back.  All right, where are we at, at?  We've got a couple more contestants for the R&A Money Snatch game that goes down Wednesday.  We'll try to get more later on in the show today, right?  Right.  We can come in and do the content.  Also, you've got to go to foundrymusic.com because Stalker Patty wants to do the Money  Snatch.  Yeah.  And we have left it up to the listeners. 
[01:25:00]  Should we let her do it or should we tell her no?  So go to foundrymusic.com and vote.  It's up to you.  The poll should be up very soon.  I think when we come back, we've got some Tyson audio to get to.  Yeah, I can't wait to hear some of this.  We've got to talk about Clinton TV, wants to do a talk show, and other things.  I think we could go to the F.U. line.  A lot of people calling that.  Oh, wait, hold on.  Oh, man.  No.  Tom?  You got that, Sherry Oak.  Oak, she loves you, man. 
[01:25:30]  You got her.  You got her.  You got her.  You got her.  You got her.  You got her.  He would bite your ass, baby.  That's the problem.  Baby.  He would like it.  In the hot tub.  He would like it.  Hey, Tom, how old are your kids?  What?  How old are the kids?  How old are they?  Four and two.  Four and two?  Yeah.  Where are they now?  So there's still hope.  They're with my mother.  What do the kids have?  No, Norton.  Norton, who has no kids, who should not breed, believe me. 
[01:26:00]  I know.  Norton, please don't breed.  It's the most reasonable thing I've ever heard him say.  You know.  All right, Tom.  All right.  We love you guys.  No, no, no.  But the thing was?  What?  You got him, but the thing was.  Yeah, you got to switch out.  You got to mix it up, because he wouldn't...  He wouldn't have just gone for, oh, and, uh, oh, Tom?  Oh, and the thing was, what?  Cleek.  You see, you get him started talking about the kids, you get them in a different direction. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  And then he's like, uh-huh.  Like, he's looking that way.  He's looking that way.  Damn.  You're the alcoholic in the middle is going, what do you want from me?  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That's a hell of a reaction, Tom.  I just lost my job.  I got a four-year-old and a two-year-old.  I have no discernible income.  Sounds like a party to me.  Yeah, it'll be a little different when he wakes up tomorrow.  With that hangover and unemployment looming.  Maybe his wife could do the O&A money snatch game. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  What is this drink she brought me?  All right.  Thank you, Uncle John.  Hey, Tom.  You know?  Wait a minute with that language, Tom.  Hold on.  You know the rules.  You can't stop.  I thought I loved you guys, man.  I thought you loved me.  Believe me.  I've got a little coin, man.  I was raised with my grandparents.  We're not.  Mom and dad.  We're not.  I have a little coin in the bank.  I'm fine.  All right.  We're not making sure.  I see people who have jobs driving Acuras, and I'm driving an Expedition. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  But, Tom, you know what the thing is?  Tom?  What?  Wow.  I could just sit here all day doing that to him.  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  Oh, and?  All right.  We better break, huh?  All right. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  You're not going to work on him, Ben.  Hey, we got some tickets for Curse of Budweiser.  Oh.  See the Nets game, what, Sunday?  There you go.  Nice.  We'll give those away in a little bit, too.  All right.  Let's rock.  You guys are able.  You sound like a fruity stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  Oh, my God.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:28:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Joey Two Scoops from D.C.  And getting time on his wife is like playing dodgeball with retards.  Of course.  So easy to get.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  So we're asking our listeners to vote if we should have Stalker Patty do the Opie and  Anthony money snatch thing.  Well, she's pretty desperate. 
[01:29:00]  She was comfortable with the nudity.  Yesterday, I filled her in on the little twist to this game.  She declined.  But she called back today and said she wanted to do it.  So we're leaving it up to the listeners.  I guess we have a poll up on foundrymusic.com.  And people have been voting already?  Yeah, the poll's been up about five minutes.  Around 500 people have voted.  171 say yes.  336 say no.  Looking grim.  Two sick Fs.  It's looking grim. 
[01:29:30]  She's destitute.  Looking grim.  We're going to try to get two more contestants before the end of the show.  And I think that'll do it.  We'll be all set for Wednesday when we do the Opie and Anthony money snatch game.  Right now, though, man, we've got to go right to the Tyson audio.  Oh, wait a minute.  Line four.  Norton audio.  What?  Kyle.  Yes, I have a little thumping for you.  How did you get this?  Not only the audio, but we also have a video clip.  Which will be emailed to you as soon as this is done.  Ready? 
[01:30:00]  Okay, let's hear.  Here it goes.  No, I don't like it.  I can barely hear it.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  That's right.  That's it.  That was really hard to hear.  That was bad audio, dude.  I know, man.  It was probably just my acting.  Hold on a second.  Here it goes again.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  And I don't like him.  World Jimmy Norton from Spider-Man.  Spider-Man.  Blockbuster.  Early truck driver. 
[01:30:30]  Yes, very surly.  He sounded surly.  Give me an email address, and I'll send this off.  How do you get this, Kyle?  I work at a theater.  All right.  There you go.  If you sneeze, you miss me in a blockbuster.  What a zero I am.  Hey, you're in it.  You're in it, man.  It's going to do well.  All right.  Tyson.  Everyone's talking about Tyson.  We got the latest audio from Mike Tyson.  That's all you need to know.  Latest audio.  Mike Tyson.  Unbelievable.  There's no real setup here.  He was talking to CNN about his upcoming fight with Lennox Lewis, and he talks to reporters. 
[01:31:00]  He talks about reporters.  He talks about his life.  He talks about effing.  He talks about everything.  It's all great.  Love him.  Because this guy is insane.  He's radio gold for this radio show.  He's completely insane.  So let's go right to it, Ann, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Mike Tyson.  Feel my pain.  He's talking about the reporters that are all just staring at him. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  They're not brave enough to ask him any questions.  Of course not.  So he just starts babbling.  The average person believes that I'm a f***ing nut, and I deserve whatever happened to me.  That's what I believe.  Listen, I'm 36 years old.  I'm 36.  I never dreamed of living this long.  I never dreamed of fornicating with as many beautiful women as I did.  I'm having as much money as I did.  It is a day.  And having as beautiful and intelligent kids as I did.  So I was a dad mom.  I've won. 
[01:32:00]  I've won.  You know, I'm just in the pain that I'm going to have for the rest of my life.  And by some way, a little bit of power, I'm trying to give some of that pain to y'all.  You know, sometimes you guys, you have no pride.  So it doesn't matter what I say, your guys doesn't affect you guys because your guys don't care about nothing but money.  So every now and then I kick your f***ing ass and stomp on you and put some kind of pain or inflict some kind of pain on you  because you deserve to feel the pain, somewhat of the pain that I feel.  If I wish one of you guys had children so I could kick them in the f***ing head and stomp on their testicles 
[01:32:30]  so you could feel my pain because that's the pain I have.  I love them.  Oh, my God.  I want to stomp on your children's testicles.  I really do.  So you could feel some of the pain I feel.  Wow.  You know, me just saying that, it sounds frigging retarded.  I want to stomp on your children's heads and testicles.  Testicle.  Y-A-P-R-O-S.  You're going to tell me I'm spelling testicles wrong? 
[01:33:00]  No, that's I guess the way you spell it.  Don't tell me that.  Come over here because you know what I'll do, don't you?  I forgot.  You're right.  I will stomp you on your testicles.  Yeah.  You won't have children's.  You won't have testicles.  Well, here's a...  I can't believe all the beautiful women that I've had are fornicated with.  Fornicate.  Fornicate.  L.  All right, the number four.  I know it starts with four.  Fornicate.  That's a toughie. 
[01:33:30]  But I can't believe all the women I had to fornicate with.  And you know what the Kowanky think?  They can't believe it neither.  All of them.  Sometimes they don't even remember it until they have some subdued memories come back.  They've been hidden in the back of their brain.  And then all of a sudden they maybe...  Let's just say they go...  They switch on the Discovery Channel.  And they see a show on the mist gorillas.  Gorillas in the mist.  Then all of a sudden they're smashing their head.  Oh my God, I was raped by Mike Tyson. 
[01:34:00]  So any little thing could...  Even as simple as a Samsonite commercial.  Can get them remembering their sexual encounter with me.  Usually they don't remember when they're still in the coma.  But once they come out, they're like,  Oh, Mike Tyson.  And we're Mike Tyson.  Then I have to belt them a few times in the uterus.  And go to their fathers.  And punch them in the face.  And step on their testicles. 
[01:34:30]  He's the best.  We have just begun.  Here's a Mike Tyson clip.  Because I'm 36 going on 36.  Did I actually say that?  And no one commented?  Look how scared you mother-effers are.  Look, I'm 36 going on 25.  I found a time machine.  And you're not going to dispute me, are you?  Won't go back in time.  Well, here's a clip of Mike Tyson talking about Jesus, Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  Jesus.  Jesus.  Does he know about Jesus?  And I feel like sometimes in this world that I used to be born in the wrong, I'm not meant for this particular society.  Because everybody here is a f***ing hypocrite.  Everyone says they believe in God, but they don't do God work.  Everybody do counteract what God is really about.  You know what I mean?  If Jesus was here, you think Jesus would show me love?  You think Jesus would love me? 
[01:35:30]  Really?  I'm a Muslim, but do you think Jesus would love me?  No, no, no.  Tell me.  No, no, no.  Tell me.  Do you think Jesus would love me if he was here?  Really?  What do you think?  I don't have the inside track.  No?  I don't know.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think Jesus will.  I think me and Jesus.  I think he smoked weed, but since people here say he drank, I think Jesus would have  a drink with me and discuss my part.  You're acting like that.  You know, it's cool.  I didn't forget that.  He would talk to me.  God, that reporter relieved himself in his pants.  Do you think Jesus loved me?  Shut up.  Do you think Jesus loved me?  Do you think Jesus loved me? 
[01:36:00]  Answer me.  Do you think Jesus loved me?  Do you think Jesus loved me?  I don't have the inside track on that.  Open your f***ing mouth and tell me, do you think Jesus loved me?  Yeah, sure.  I think he would love you.  Yes.  See, that's the wrong answer.  Jesus is going to hate me, and now I'm going to f*** you right in your a**hole.  I thought that's what you wanted to hear, Mr. Tyson.  Whatever you say is the wrong answer, because I'm like an animal.  I'm like a crazy, a crazed animal.  Well, then why'd you ask me?  Can't you pick on that guy over there?  No, because later I'm going to go over to him and belt him in the head and step on his testicles. 
[01:36:30]  That guy must have been freaking.  Oh, you can hear it in his voice.  Do you think Jesus loved me?  And the guy's just died, died, died.  And Tyson's saying that Jesus would be smoking pot and stuff, and I guarantee the reporters are all like, yeah, okay, cool.  Yeah, I can see that.  I was born in a different time.  I should have been born in the caveman days, where it was okay to just grab a b***h and club her over the head, drag her back to your hotel room.  They didn't have hotel rooms back then.  What happened?  Never mind. 
[01:37:00]  They didn't?  They better.  I would be the Cro-Magnon man, not the Neanderthal man.  I was more developed.  Look at the skull.  See, I had the big skull for the brain.  Although the front of my face looked quite Neanderthal-ish, but that was from all the fisticuffs.  And then I would single-handedly take down a mammoth, and I would wear his pelt to keep warm.  As I migrate during the Ice Age, I had to go south with my peoples because it'd get cold, and Mike don't like the cold. 
[01:37:30]  And we'd just go, and I'd be kicking saber-toothed tiger's asses.  Saber-toothed tiger.  T-O-O-F.  And then I'd grab him, and I'd punch him in the testicles.  The tiger, because they like that.  Remember?  I like saber-toothed tigers.  Saber-tee-footed tiger.  Saber-toothed tiger.  T-O-O-F.  Saber-toothes, Tufasaurs, Tufasaurs, they roamed the Earth back in the Mesozoic era. 
[01:38:00]  Mesozoic's my child's name.  I'm named a Mesozoic.  Are you done over there, Mr. Tyson?  Yeah, I think he's done.  I don't want to interrupt him.  I want to hear another clip.  All right.  This one's labeled, Don't Talk to Me.  I'm trying to remember this one.  I don't know.  It'll make sense.  Let's just play it.  All right.  I've been consistent with my conduct with people, regardless if it may be moral or amoral or moral, so to speak. 
[01:38:30]  You know, people know not to talk to me.  Yeah, I'm going to love it when people just don't talk to me.  That's an awesome feeling when people just walk by you and say, hi, I just don't talk to you.  I'll look at you and just, man, that's beautiful.  I love not being f***ed with.  He knows the power he has.  He knows no one's going to f*** with him. 
[01:39:00]  And he's fine with it.  Maybe he should be our agent.  Ken, the boys are looking to get into Los Angeles.  Now, you better put them in there because I don't want to have to crawl around Los Angeles climbing them buildings and holding blondes in my hands.  Because they were swatting their pipelines.  Because I'll do it for them.  Don't f*** with me.  Don't f*** with me.  Ken, I will f*** you till you love me. 
[01:39:30]  Like, Jesus loved me.  We go out drinking.  Me and Jesus.  And sometimes, like, some guy gets in my face and I f*** him up pretty bad.  And I say, oh, Jesus Christ, look at him.  And Jesus, look at him.  But I was just saying, like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Like, everybody says it.  But then there's Jesus.  He's right there with me.  Sometimes I see him when I take too much of the Zoloft.  I see Jesus and everybody.  I see Darth Vader without the helmet looking like Donald Pleasance. 
[01:40:00]  I see the Ewoks all standing there waving at me like ghostly figures at the end of a bad movie.  Mr. Tyson, doesn't Jesus carry you on the beach when you're feeling down?  One time me and Jesus was walking, right?  Yeah.  And I noticed footprints in the sand.  Right next to yours, right?  Right next to mine, right?  And I'm walking and I said, how come during the hardest times in Mike's life, there's only one set of footprints?  Jesus, why did you abandon me during the hardest times in my life? 
[01:40:30]  And Jesus said, no, Mike.  That is when I carried you.  And I said, Jesus Christ.  And he said, yeah.  And then I punched him in the face saying, get your hands off, Mike.  I could walk myself.  I don't need no f***ing Savior carrying me down the beach.  That looks stupid.  Little skinny white guy carrying Mike Tyson.  That's bulls**t.  Oh, that's bulls**t.  Because everybody, could you imagine like you're at the beach, right?  And you got your cooler and your blanket and your umbrella. 
[01:41:00]  And you're sitting at the beach.  And all of a sudden you look down by the water and you go, is that Jesus Christ f***ing carrying Mike Tyson?  And you got to look and say, there ain't no way that's possible.  How the f*** is Jesus Christ, the little skinny guy, he couldn't even put himself off a cross, but he's going to carry f***ing Mike Tyson?  That's bulls**t, I tell you.  I carry Jesus.  So then he admitted to me, all right, the footprints was yours.  I wasn't there at the right. 
[01:41:30]  I left you.  And I'm like, f***ing Jesus, man.  What the hell is that, Rick?  My Jesus is an awesome Jesus.  But he ain't carry no f***ing Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson is awesome, Tyson. 
[01:42:00]  I'll punch you in the f***ing intestinal.  And the Lord wasn't joking when he kicked him out of evil.  What a lame song.  All right.  More Tyson audio.  He explains in this clip how he endured hardships.  Hardships?  Many, many hardships.  People already have, listen, people already have their perception of me as a person, and they will equate that with me as a fighter, as they always do. 
[01:42:30]  But the people that make that equation never endured the hardship of training, never sacrificed what I sacrificed.  All you guys capitalize on my demise.  And whatever I do, good or wrong, you guys capitalize.  If you say something great about me, you say something derogatory about me, your guys all capitalize.  Your guys always win.  I never win.  So I can't win in this particular field, that is. 
[01:43:00]  I made a lot of sacrifice.  I took these burlap sacks and I put vices in them.  That's how I sacrifice.  I swear to God, that's what I did.  You don't know the trials and tribulations I've been through.  It's tough being Mike Tyson.  You'll never understand.  That's why I have to f**k you all in your f**k hole. 
[01:43:30]  I love that show back in the 80s, Miami Sacrifice.  It was great.  Mike, someone wants to know what you're talking about when you say equations.  Equations.  That's the center point on the earth.  The equation.  It's the hottest place on the earth.  That's the equator.  The what?  Equations, like math.  Oh, so let me get this straight.  You're correcting Mike Tyson?  Is that what you're doing?  No, you're right.  Would Jesus love me?  Would Jesus love me? 
[01:44:00]  What's the equator?  Jesus wants...  What's the equation?  Jesus wants...  Where's the equation?  Jesus wants...  Where's the equation?  Where's the equation, mother...  Where's the equation?  Jesus wants...  Where's the equation?  Jesus wants to party with you, Mike.  Where's the equation?  It's like...  It's the hottest point where?  On the...  Spell it.  Earth.  Spell it.  E...  A...  A-R-F.  Earth.  Oh, you put an A in there.  That's stupid.  You're ignorant.  It's E...  Earth. 
[01:44:30]  E-R-F.  Earth.  Earth.  Okay.  The planet Earth.  The planet from the sun.  Mm-hmm.  75% water here.  With one natural satellite, we caught the moon.  All right.  We got another clip from Mike Tyson.  Talking about when he wins the fight, Anthony.  When he wins the fight.  When he wins the fight.  When I win, it's just going to be a celebration for all the people that you know me. 
[01:45:00]  Definitely people in the ghetto all over the world.  People in penitentiary.  The people in trench town just have no hope or anything.  I know it's not going to change their economic system and their living system.  But it may give them some hope because me wouldn't even change my economic and living system.  Because I'm more despised than any person in the bowels of the ghetto than anybody.  I'm the most accepted, rogue, and disgusting individual in this world. 
[01:45:30]  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Everybody knows who I am.  They may shake my hand.  But I'm not sure they won't let me f*** their daughter or anything because of my reputation that came about over the years.  Did you want to say situation?  Sitchkeyishkin.  Sitchkeyishkin.  Sitchkeyishkin.  Sitchkeyishkin.  That's wonderful.  You should have said situation instead of a system there, Mike.  Everybody's going to be happy.  Everyone in the ghettos.  Everyone.  I'm hoping to hear cheering all over the prisons.  All of my good buddies. 
[01:46:00]  Well, I got friends in low places.  Schillinger, Beecher.  I'm hoping they, you know, are proud of me from Oz before I f*** them, too.  Let me play the last clip.  Oh, please do.  All right.  Can't you be a positive story?  Nah, no way.  It can't come across.  That's why I can't.  I won't talk nice to you and talk about fornicking with you and letting you suck my s*** because if I was eloquent with you, you would still look at me as a scumbag. 
[01:46:30]  It won't work.  You have your perception of me.  You elicit your perception of me from the camera, from the news.  So I give you what you want and what I am, miniatarily.  What?  Want to hear it again?  Yeah, let me hear that.  She's brave enough to ask her question.  Yeah, he said the word eloquent in there.  And that's what it was?  Eloquent.  Can't you be a positive story? 
[01:47:00]  Nah, no way.  It can't come across.  That's why I can't, I won't talk nice to you and talk about fornicking with you and letting you suck my s*** because if I was eloquent with you, you would still look at me as a scumbag.  It won't work.  You have your perception of me.  You elicit your perception of me from the camera, from the news.  So I give you what you want and what I am, miniatarily.  Miniatarily?  Miniatarily.  That's when I'm small, when I feel little.  I'm miniatarily.  You are one miniatarily little mother f***er. 
[01:47:30]  I swear to God.  Look how miniatarily.  And what?  I can't speak eloquent?  I speak eloquent.  Watch.  I saw the eloquents at the zoo and they were cute.  A little baby eloquent and the big ones and I feed them peanuts.  I feed them peanuts.  Peanuts?  Peanuts.  Peanuts.  That's what I said.  The little, yeah.  I heard you.  Peanuts.  The brown thing.  The penis.  The penis.  The penis.  Peanuts.  That's what I'm saying.  You're talking about peanuts.  That's what I feed them. 
[01:48:00]  Don't you like Babaw the baby elephant?  Yes.  And Dumbo is good.  They are eloquents.  Eloquents.  You know, there's an African eloquent and an Indian elephant.  Quinn.  And the African eloquent had the big ears and the Indian one got the small ears.  That's right.  And the woolly mammoth was a type of eloquent.  But he got extinct when the, what?  Oh, never mind.  What's that?  Did Jesus love me?  Did Jesus love me? 
[01:48:30]  Did Jesus love me?  You're damn right he does.  Yes, he loves you.  You better say he does or you're going to be shaking his hand in a matter of minutes with  a big **** up your ****.  I swear to God.  I'm sorry.  I'm a scumbag.  That's what.  I'm a scumbag.  You know it.  I'm a scumbag and that's all you're looking for.  You don't want me speaking eloquently.  You want me, you know, you don't want me ****ing your daughter or nothing.  She don't want to be ****ing me neither.  But she gonna tonight in my hotel room. 
[01:49:00]  I just got to grab a handful of hair like the Cro-Magnon man.  Spin her over on my pelts that I use as a bed and **** her.  I got a eloquent size ****.  It's huge.  It's just like the eloquence.  It's like an eloquence trunk.  Sometimes for foreplay, I have her feed it peanuts.  Peanuts.  That's what I said.  Don't get scared now. 
[01:49:30]  Don't get scared.  I hear you.  I got some good memory just like the eloquence.  Good memory for peanuts.  That's what I said.  Don't **** with me.  They're afraid of mice, you know, eloquence.  They freak out.  Once I saw a cat, right?  A cat.  It was trying to get, um, test a dog.  So he brought eloquent and he wound up a little mouse and he set him loose on the floor.  And the eloquent stood up and put his, uh, and stood on a bed and went, ah, ah. 
[01:50:00]  It was in a cartoon.  He, like, pulled his little dress up and went, ah, ooh, and did a dance.  But that's got to be real life.  And how do you spell eloquent?  E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T.  Eloquent.  See, it's right, but it's wrong.  That's funny, right?  That's very funny.  Nice twist.  Is Mike done over there?  All right. 
[01:50:30]  There you go.  Okay.  There we go.  We'll step aside for a little bit here.  Minitarily.  I gots the cheddar.  I could pay to rank for a great deal.  All right.  Being a black guy.  You son of a man.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  Hope you like crap. 
[01:51:00]  W.  W.  27.  The Open Anthony Show.  W and E. W.  Yeah, you're checking out the Open Anthony Show.  Y'all.  We just saw the clip of Lowell Jimmy Norton.  How cool is that?  It's Spider-Man.  Unbelievable.  Very cool.  He stinks and I don't like him.  He stinks and I don't like him. 
[01:51:30]  And from the clip that we saw, it's just a face shot, pretty much, of Jim.  Your head has to be 15 feet high on the movie screen.  It's all you in that scene.  As it should be.  You're not in the background.  You're not doing something where it's a dick.  It's you.  It's just your head.  Yeah.  Well, everybody else was afraid I would steal the scene.  Mr. Faber-Sham, he stinks and I don't like him.  And it's out of the question.  Out of the question.  I think we got the audio, Ant.  A clear copy. 
[01:52:00]  Two.  Two.  Two.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Two.  Two.  Two.  There it is.  Two.  Oh, he was on.  But, Mr. Faber-Sham, I'll have it in my contract that I must return here every year to do the  raccoon's show.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Oh, he stinks, Rachel.  You've come back and you stink. 
[01:52:30]  Bravo, little Jim.  Yeah.  And the movie getting just rave reviews here in the New York papers.  Hey, we got a couple things we need to do still.  We need to get a couple more contestants for the ONA Money Snatch thing that's going down  Wednesday.  I hate your string of peloponies.  Also, they want us to push the ONA Celebrity Slash Bikini Softball game that goes down June  1st.  Right.  At Riverfront Stadium in Newark, New Jersey.  Tickets are going fast, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're over 4,000 tickets sold.  Over 4,000. 
[01:53:00]  Closing in on like 4,500, and I think capacity is like six.  Wow.  So this thing is going to sell out within the next day or two.  Maybe by the end of today.  I don't know.  It's going to be a great, great time.  Just announced today, Anthony, Tom from New Orleans, who was fired.  Well, he says he resigned, but he saw it coming.  That's what happens.  You see it coming, and you resign.  You know what that is?  That's a company throwing you a bone so you don't have to go to your next job and say  you got fired.  Well, I resigned my last position. 
[01:53:30]  Shut up.  No, Tom.  You were fired.  You were fired.  Well, you were going to be fired.  Anyway, it's tradition on the Opie and Anthony show that the person that is fired gets to  throw out the first pitch.  Right.  You may remember the last time we did a celebrity-slash-bikini softball game, it was Psycho  Mark.  Mm-hmm.  He had just been fired.  This year, we're flying Tom up from New Orleans to throw out the first pitch for the game.  You know how hammered he's going to get?  He's just going to be in the dugout.  Ah, I want to play a little bit. 
[01:54:00]  Let the pitch.  I'll bet he doesn't even throw the ball.  He'll just hold it in his hand and breathe on it, and it will jump into the catcher's  message.  He's going to lick it, thinking it's Jimmy's head.  Maybe we can.  Give it a little lick.  Maybe we can do him a favor and just knock out those teeth with the softball.  You won't have to.  He'll do a good sneeze.  I'm sure a couple will fall out.  That's my jig, you jig.  Like the Tommyknockers.  Or like the fly.  Brundle fly.  Just reaches in and pulls it out. 
[01:54:30]  I, um...  He's got a big, coarse hair on his awful back.  Oh, man.  That was great.  And this chick is just like, oh, let me get that for you.  Not like, ah!  Let me pick at that for a while.  There's a big hair in your back.  Anthony, stuff we're working on for the Celebrity Softball.  We're going to have like this concourse set up with all sorts of things you could do.  It'll be like a midway.  Like a midway.  Yeah.  With unusual things.  We're going to have the Frenchie dunking booth, Anthony.  We're working on live music as you file into the stadium. 
[01:55:00]  We're doing a halftime show, basically.  Yeah.  A short halftime show with some festivities.  And one of the things we're hoping will go down, we're going to pick 10 listeners from  the stands to come onto the field and try to win $25,000.  $25,000.  I've seen this thing at like hockey games and baseball games.  Uh-huh.  We're going to get one of those things.  What you do is, you know, it's one of those pitch things where you've got to pitch a ball  into a very limited area. 
[01:55:30]  The only twist, totally naked.  And I will tell you the twist.  No, no, no.  No, no.  You don't have to fire the ball.  Something like, oh, that's a different contest.  You're making light pitches and you catch.  No, I'm kidding, of course.  It's completely legit.  We'll get you out of the stands and you'll have a chance.  We're also working on the Titanic slide.  I hope this happens.  We're trying to figure out where we can put the damn thing because it's huge.  It is very big.  I think it's actual size.  We're hoping girls in bikinis will slide down this thing.  Oh.  The smoke sacks and stuff.  Wouldn't that be great?  And other things are going to be added. 
[01:56:00]  Bows them with ice water when they hit the bottom.  Just like the real thing.  Other things will be added as we go along.  We've got a couple surprises we don't want to announce right now.  But get your tickets through Ticketmaster.  Snow cones?  Yes, we're working on snow cones.  The Paul Shanley confessional?  Is that going to be in the midway?  I heard that's a great place to take the kids.  No?  Wow.  And the tussle booth?  The tussle for a buck?  We want that booth, but you won't do it.  Tussle?  No one doesn't want to put his hands in people's hair. 
[01:56:30]  I'll do it with gloves.  I'll tussle your hair.  I'll put on a pair of gloves and get it.  A pair of surgical gloves?  Tussle for a buck.  I was checking out some of the message boards, and there are people, they would have you  tussle their hair.  You can put on the big gloves.  Do it for an hour.  Tussle by a celebrity from a blockbuster motion picture.  Oh, how hilarious is that?  I won't put on the Spider-Man, the delivery man costume, no, unless it's an extra $2,000.  Oh, yeah, put in the delivery man costume.  Deliver your line every time you tussle.  I'm like Clayton Moore.  I can't wear it anymore, so I have to wear something that looks like a delivery costume. 
[01:57:00]  You're not allowed by law.  Yeah, we'll do it for charity.  Maybe the Save Paul Shanley's Job Sunday.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Remember that with the Lone Ranger, though?  That's who it was.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was the Lone Ranger.  He made the role famous, but they wouldn't let him wear the mask.  The Lone Ranger mask.  So he went around with huge, just-got-cataract-surgery sunglasses on.  Huh?  Hi-oh, Silver, away!  Awful.  And they wouldn't let him wear the mask, those pricks. 
[01:57:30]  Because copyrights or whatever.  Yeah.  It was his only thing in life.  I know.  Throw the guy a bone.  Made so much money off him.  He should have wore one of those sleeping masks.  You know those things you put on and doze off?  Can I have one of them?  Like Mrs. Roper used to wear.  With her moo-moo.  What a hot bitch.  Yeah, she was great.  She always wanted to get effed.  Yeah.  I love the fact that Stanley wouldn't cough up anything for her.  Stanley never slipped her one.  She was always horny for Jack. 
[01:58:00]  Would you?  If you were Mr. Roper?  Norman Fell?  The greatest ever.  You love Norman Fell.  Who doesn't?  He's doing the Norman.  Another great visual.  Another great visual for a radio.  When he'd say that joke and just kind of open his mouth and smile and turn his head slowly to the side.  So it was Norman Sparks?  All right.  Stop with the Sparks impression.  I love Ben.  He's killing me with his visual bits today.  All right.  So, Anthony, the celebrity softball game. 
[01:58:30]  Bikini, whatever.  It goes down June 1st.  Tickets are going fast.  Right.  You can get them through Ticketmaster or at the Riverfront Stadium box office.  You go there and you avoid the service charge.  Right?  Right.  And this time around, we're making sure that every player that plays is someone you know or hate from the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Loved or hated, you will know them.  Last time we did this, we had to throw some filler guys in there.  Yep.  Guys to fill up the teams.  But we have plenty of guys that are associated with this show that we'll be playing. 
[01:59:00]  So it's a no-brainer.  Get your tickets.  Okay.  Did we get word from Devin?  Devin.  Buzz.  From Home Alone.  Because that's a celebrity.  You know.  He will play.  He will play.  He's a great guy.  Buzz from Home Alone.  Oh, he's going to play ball as far as that's concerned?  Yeah.  I know.  He doesn't want to play.  He's getting a little nervous about the...  A little heat.  A little heat from that bit?  Yeah, he's getting heat from his pops.  What?  Say no more.  Say no more.  Oh, really?  We can't even discuss it now? 
[01:59:30]  Ugh.  We put him in a bad situation.  It's a touchy situation!  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Nah, all right.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, want to get two more contestants for the Money Snatch game?  I certainly do.  And then we're hitting the road next week.  We're going to be in Philly on Thursday.  D.C. on Friday for Jim Norton's show.  Oh, yeah.  We've got things going on in Philly and Washington.  Well, that's if I'm not needed in Hollywood.  You're going to leave with your gal Lucy, Fred and Ethel in the back seat? 
[02:00:00]  California, here I come.  Right back where I started from.  Ethel in front of the back.  Oh!  Maybe I could perform six times a year and convince some of my Hollywood friends to do  the same.  Sure, Mike.  Anything for my godfather.  All right.  Oh, he's a good actor.  Good job from your grandson, Frank. 
[02:00:30]  Jimmy's going to want one of them roles in the movies, but the producer won't let him in.  Jim Norton never gets that part.  It's perfect for him.  It'll get him a job at UPS.  Godfather, I'm a meaty breasted, no chin, little nothing.  I need that part.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, Godfather.  My lips are thin.  And I have pink cap nipples like Tracy Lorgz in 1984. 
[02:01:00]  Hot!  Slow fades.  Complete zilch.  Oh, God.  Tom, why didn't you tell me you work for Opie and Anthony?  They don't like their names mentioned unless your shirt's being lifted.  Anything they should ask for.  But this, I can't do.  All right, let's get some contestants in.  Hadou.  We have Marsha. 
[02:01:30]  Marsha waited like two hours yesterday, so we want to give her a chance today.  Marsha?  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  You've been hearing about the O&A Money Snatch game that goes down next Wednesday, right?  I listen to you guys every day.  Thank you.  Now who's being naive?  You so suck.  Thank you, Marsha.  But I called because I think this is the first contest I can really win.  Oh!  I think I've really got a good idea what that second twist is.  Yeah.  And I think I can do this.  Hmm. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  I'm not sure you do have an idea, but we'll find out.  Okay.  Completely naked.  You understand that?  Oh, yes.  I have no problem with that.  Money all over the studio, like ten naked girls running around collecting as much money  as possible.  Well, the one that collects the most while they're naked gets whatever's left in the  studio.  On the floor.  On the floor.  The only concern...  The only concern...  The concern I have about the money all over the floor, though, if it's brand new money  like you were talking about yesterday...  Yeah.  No, no, no, Marsha, I think I know what you're going to say.  Don't say a word. 
[02:02:30]  I was just worried about paper cuts on the bottom of my feet.  That could happen, but...  You know, there's got to be some way you can soften it up.  Like, have you ever washed your jeans with money in it and the money came out nice and soft?  Maybe you could, like, wash it?  Marsha, you're trying to do bits and I'm seconds away from hanging up on it.  No one's washing the money.  We're not illegal.  That's called launder the money.  Montana Realty Company.  All right, you want to explain the last twist to Marsha, Anthony?  Okay, if my mic can be shut off.  Okay, we'll start the music. 
[02:03:00]  You get nothing!  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  What happened?  The music isn't set up?  Because someone decided to go to something else.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's all right.  Hang up on it.  No, I don't want to hang up on it.  She sounds kind of fun.  All right.  Ready, Marsha?  Yeah.  All right, we turn off Anthony's mic.  You can still hear him.  The audience can't.  Anthony's now talking to Marsha.  Yes, I can. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, yes.  Okay.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Very.  Yes.  Very dark.  Yes.  Oh, there's the only one. 
[02:04:00]  Marsha.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  It always feels good.  It always feels good.  And I think we have another contestant.  I think we have another contestant.  Bravo, Marsha.  I only have one more question. 
[02:04:30]  Uh-oh.  No, no, no, no.  I work till 5 o'clock, and I wondered if this was going to be a 520 bit, because I can get  there by then, because I work right here in this city.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, no.  Come on.  You're kidding.  Marsha, for this chance, you know, you might have to take half a day or something.  Oh, man.  You can't leave the office a little early?  You get nothing.  I don't work in an office.  I work at a live theater.  Good day, sir.  Hmm.  Wow.  Opie just slams the phone down.  We can't F around with this contestant. 
[02:05:00]  You're right.  Look how many girls want in.  I know.  Wow.  Any of these girls that have qualified for this contest and back out, you're really going  to disappoint a lot of ladies.  Yeah.  I love that show.  We can't mess around anymore.  She was sexy.  No negotiations.  Mm-hmm.  We've got to be tough, guys.  We've got to be tough.  Sorry about that, sports fans.  We'll try one more, Anthony.  We might have a few spots that we're going to have to fill on Monday.  I know.  We'll try one more for today.  It's Shannon.  Shannon?  Hi. 
[02:05:30]  Hi.  How old are you, Shannon?  I'm good.  How are you?  How old a gal are you?  I just turned 19.  Ah.  19.  19.  19.  Now, 19.  Well, I don't know what else to say about that.  All right, 19.  Now, you understand this contest?  Yes.  Oh, hell, she's in.  Yeah, what the hell?  Describe yourself a little to our listening audience.  Well, I'm 5'6".  5'6", Opie. 
[02:06:00]  I have blonde hair.  He's a lie.  Yeah.  I weigh about 120 pounds.  Uh-huh.  I just got a tongue ring.  I have a belly button ring.  Uh-huh.  And I'm a 36 B.  I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.  Fucking little B cup.  Oh.  There you go.  We like the Bs.  All right.  We like the Bs.  And you're comfortable with your nudity.  Absolutely.  Absolutely comfortable at 19 with her nudity.  And you have no problem running around the studio with 10 other girls or about 10 girls  total grabbing money. 
[02:06:30]  Nope.  Okay.  All right.  But there's another twist, though, you know.  Another little twist that I will tell you about right now.  Right now, as I turn Anthony's mic off, he's now talking to Shannon, who can still...  Yes.  ...hear him.  Mm-hmm.  Excuse me?  A while.  Uh, four. 
[02:07:00]  Three.  Get to the question.  I know, but please.  Oh, I don't know.  Uh, probably about eight.  Four, three, eight.  Yeah.  No.  No.  So-so. 
[02:07:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  Uh-oh. 
[02:08:00]  That's it?  Yeah.  Yes, I have told it.  Now, remember, don't repeat that, Shannon.  That's crazy.  Anything, but yeah, that's, that's, oh-ho-ho.  Yeah, that's crazy, all right.  And, um, yeah, you, that, that's, that's the twist.  You're still, uh, you're still up for it, Shannon?  Absolutely.  Wow.  Oh!  I didn't expect that answer.  You guys, I just want to tell you, I listen to your show every day.  I love you guys so much.  Thank you so very much.  We love you. 
[02:08:30]  And Shannon, never been with a black guy.  No.  Something I learned.  Well, Shannon, uh, hold on the line.  Someone will get your info.  All right.  All right, hold on, Shannon.  Shannon's going to be part of the O&A Money Snack.  There you go.  I am seeing a side event that I really like.  You really are an awful man.  I get really filthy with these calls.  I actually, like, I went, uh-oh, like I said something wrong, because I was, I forgot 
[02:09:00]  that I was off the air.  Yeah.  The S word actually got me upset with myself.  I went, oh, damn, I said the, oh, wait, I've been saying, oof, forget about what I'm doing.  You're dressed like a woodshop teacher, just saying filthy things.  I love it.  I was doing my, my Paul Shanley impression.  How many contestants are we up to?  Six.  Seven.  Wow.  Six?  Mm-hmm.  All right, we only have, uh, two spots left, I think, in the contest.  Yeah.  And then we got to call the girls to make sure they're definitely in.  So, I, I, girl, a couple girls from yesterday dropped out after we talked to them a second 
[02:09:30]  time.  So, uh, we'll get more contestants on Monday, Anthony.  Yeah, Monday.  The O&A Money Snatch goes down Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Great.  And, uh, there's a little side thing going on.  Stalker Patty is really desperate for money.  She needs to pay the rent.  So, she wants in on this damn thing.  So, we, uh, we're leaving it up to the listeners to decide if she should be part of the Money  Snatch.  Pathetic Auschwitz-looking victim gotta eat.  She's gonna be naked doing, uh, what all the other girls are gonna be doing, Anthony.  She may not eat, but you know what time she's hungry. 
[02:10:00]  So, you gotta vote on foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com, alright?  Right.  And that video clip we were talking about earlier?  Yeah.  We'll be up sometime this weekend.  Very cool.  Alright.  Um, I don't know, we'll figure it out.  We gotta talk about Clinton's talk show.  Ah.  Also, uh, you know, we gotta replay the Linda Lovelace thing, too.  That was the cringe moment, uh, of the year.  I haven't heard it.  You haven't heard it?  Nope.  You told me that, but I haven't heard it.  Alright, we gotta play that.  We might end the show with, uh, the Linda Lovelace thing.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  Talking to her sister about her, uh, her, uh, her death there.  Alright.  Stay there.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  Opie and Anthony.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  Right.  Where you can't leave anything alone.  Let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone.  You pick artistic subjects.  Opie and Anthony.  Alright, you're checking out the O&A show.  Also known as the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Sacramento checking in.  They're, they're, uh, responding to the first break of the, the, the, the show, Anthony. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, they're hearing the first break right now.  They're hearing it right now.  We're on a little delay out there.  Something to do with, uh, time zones.  Yeah, we had a, it's much too complicated for me to get in.  We had to mess with a time zone thing to get our show on in Sacramento.  Jason, what's up?  Ah, Jason.  Jason, you there, man?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I was hoping the phone didn't have the same delay on it there and we'd have to wait that  three hours for, for an answer from you.  Now, when we, uh, talked to Jason, it was, uh, 3-12 in Sacramento. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Like, right now, it's about 3-12 because we're still live in New York, but they're  hearing this in Sacramento at 6-12.  Our time.  Our time.  But Sacramento, it's 3-12.  So just like here in New York, what you heard at 3-12, they're hearing it at their 3-12.  But see, we're talking to Jason.  Yeah.  They're going to hear this in Sacramento at 6-12.  Right.  But we're talking about something we said at 3-12, New York time. 
[02:12:00]  Uh-huh.  Right?  So by the time they hear this, it'll be 9-12 here.  Oh, exactly.  So, yeah, very good.  There you go.  How many more showings of Spider-Man will have aired at movie theaters?  Yeah, you never know.  Anyway, we started the radio show by thanking Sacramento because the ratings came in.  Yeah.  And we did great at, uh, KXOA.  Mm-hmm.  We still have a ways to go, but, uh, we're moving in the right direction nicely.  Yeah.  So we thanked Sacramento.  They're finally hearing that, and now Jason's calling in.  What's up, Jason?  What's going on, O&A?  Hey. 
[02:12:30]  Hey.  Everybody wants to call in, but when we call in, we sound stupid because it's a three-hour delay.  I know.  We're talking to you about something that was three hours ago.  Well, we're thinking of something to work off of that.  Yeah, well, you guys just started a few minutes ago here, so we're just starting to hear the  beginning of the program.  We're going to have a special bit just for Sacramento.  Yeah.  All right.  To make you feel special, it's, uh, it's called the, uh, make Sacramento, uh, sound stupid  bit.  What are you guys coming up to out?  I don't know.  We're working out, uh, something, hopefully.  Okay.  All right.  Could you be more vague with that answer?  Right now, Cleveland is laughing at Sacramento. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Sure they're coming.  Buffalo's laughing.  Wait a minute, man.  Buffalo's chuckling.  Hold on.  Yeah.  I, you know, we wanted to go to Cleveland and we wanted to go to Buffalo.  I understand.  They had a great chance when, uh, Jim Norton, uh, hit the town.  We wanted to go with them.  Yeah.  Now Buffalo's trying to set something else up and now we were like, we don't know what  to do.  Oh.  But they could have had us when Jimmy was up there.  We wanted to do it.  We were all going to paint the town red.  Yeah.  Whatever.  But they couldn't figure out the details or, uh, that money thing. 
[02:13:30]  So some of our wild oats up there.  I think.  All right, Jason.  Thanks for the, thanks for helping us out with, uh, the show.  Thank you, Gary.  Good talk.  All right.  Peace.  We're going to get a school or a casino business.  Anthony, we need to play the Linda Lovelace thing.  This has to be bit of the week and it's so cringy, uh, and awful that we have to play  it on, uh, Friday.  We'll be back now.  Well, a lot of people are, uh, talking about this.  Yeah, I know.  We'll play this and, uh, you know, it's not that long and then we'll come back and play  What Did We Learn? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Uh, a little Jimmy Norton didn't even hear it.  No.  I have not heard it, Angel Face.  Ugh.  Do you have to see that?  In public.  In public?  In public.  Right.  In the dick.  Shut up.  What, Ben?  What are you pointing at?  Tickets.  After tickets.  Oh, hey.  Oh, my gosh.  What the fuck is that?  Hey, Big Mike.  Yo.  You want to go see the next?  Big time.  Sunday, uh, Sunday at the Continental Arena?  That'll be absolutely wonderful.  All right, you win them.  That was good. 
[02:14:30]  Tickets currency of Budweiser, the king of beers.  Absolutely wonderful.  All right, hold on.  I know you're faithful to listen to the show, so there you go.  Throw your bones.  All right, guys.  Are you happy, Ben?  Thank you.  That was interesting radio for 18 cities.  Look at him.  He walked out all mad.  Jimmy, how do you walk out?  You know what's funny?  You're the idiot that goes and says, we need stuff to give away, and then we get it.  We got him last minute, and I said, yeah, we'll give away, but if we don't get to it, 
[02:15:00]  we don't get to it.  That doesn't have a point, though.  We don't want to stop the flow of the show just to give away Nets tickets.  I love the team.  They had a great win last night, but Jesus.  Double overtime, not triple overtime, Anthony.  Quadruple overtime.  What do I know about basketball?  Mr. Macon believes he cares about basketball.  And doing a very bad job of it.  All right, Big Mike, you got the Nets tickets, okay?  All they care about is we promote Budweiser, the king of beer.  There you go.  They gave us the tickets.  There you go.  Everyone is effing happy.  Thank you.  Dude, because Budweiser's trying to give away tickets for my May 18th in Rochester show, 
[02:15:30]  I mean, who cares?  Oh, wow.  Who saw that coming?  Dude.  Wow.  Let's chill.  All right, Linda Lovelace, Anthony.  Yes.  Want to mess this up?  Well, Linda Lovelace, who doesn't know who Linda Lovelace is?  This cringe bit sponsored by this woman.  Go up yourself.  Linda Lovelace, she was in a porno, a very famous porno, Deep Throat.  Deep Throat.  You might remember that.  And then it turns out years later, she comes forward and says that she was coerced into doing this. 
[02:16:00]  It was like a drug-induced rape frenzy put together by her ex-husband.  And she got no money for it.  And she went on then leading the rest of her life as an advocate for people that were abused and the porn industry, blah, blah, blah.  What a bore.  I know.  I'd rather have her sucking a big...  Well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I almost said sucking a big...  I thought it was a beef.  I had that kind of fix.  What the hell did that happen? 
[02:16:30]  All right, sucking a big...  Plasure for me.  Sometimes it just works.  Sometimes.  There you go.  So she died recently in a car wreck.  Very tragic.  Very, very tragic.  And you know what?  We called Linda Lovelace's sister because we were reading the paper that they couldn't afford to bury Linda Lovelace.  That's what happened.  And we read that, and this was in the paper, they can't afford to bury Linda Lovelace.  The family's broke.  She made no money.  Can't afford to bury. 
[02:17:00]  So we were like, you know something?  We'll bury it abroad.  We'll come up with the cash and put all the money towards burying Linda Lovelace.  So we call up the sister to find out about this.  And it turns out she was buried already or cremated.  And now there's some kind of thing going where the sister's looking for money for this and the kids and that.  I can't be bothered.  Was she cremated and they just threw it on someone's back and face?  Just jerk the urn for a while. 
[02:17:30]  And someone could drink it and then spit it out.  I heard the car wreck was caused by a blown tire.  Yeah, that old blowout will kill you.  Anyway.  Oh, she should have had her head gasket fixed.  Jesus.  Anyway.  So we talked to Linda Lovelace's sister.  Did you set up this stupid thing?  I think I did.  And then we start talking to her. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know how this happened.  A couple of sound clips.  Let's put it this way.  It gets very interesting, okay?  Right.  Don't want to give too much away here.  This cringe radio bit sponsored by Hogan's Heroes.  Watch Hogan's Heroes on TV Land.  Good.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  American Badass.  Kid Rock. 
[02:18:30]  Our buddy.  Our pal.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Oh, my God.  Rick, help us out here.  All intro and stuff.  We just want to get to the meat of it.  Jerk.  Was Rick drinking during editing this?  Is that what happened?  Rick, were you drinking during the editing of this?  Maybe you fell down and thought you had cut it somewhere.  He's taking care of us, though.  He's setting this up nice for when we want to leave early one day.  Oh, yeah.  And it still sounds like we're on the air.  Nice. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  I'll give him that.  All right.  What's the event?  Shut up.  Your mic's not even on.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including Buffalo, New York, Anthony.  Oh, Buffalo.  You can use 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  Want to thank the two toll collectors.  Oh, my God, Rick.  Come on, man.  Wait a minute.  We just want to talk to the sister.  How far does this go before we actually do this?  We're already a minute in.  We're a minute into this bit, and we haven't even... 
[02:19:30]  We know now there's going to be the whole setup.  We're going to just...  We're going to explain exactly what we just explained live.  I know.  Because he wants to replay this one where we take a day off.  Oh.  Outside of Buffalo, that put the nice WOW stickers right on the toll boots for us.  Yeah.  That is huge advertising as far as the show goes and as far as WOW goes, and we love seeing that.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Buffalo.  Thank you, Buffalo.  We just want to talk to the sister. 
[02:20:00]  Rick.  What's your goddamn problem?  Rick, we want to play the bit with Linda Lovelace's sister.  So play it.  What are you...  How far does it end before we get her on the phone?  It's probably any minute, for Christ's sakes, but you keep stopping the damn thing.  We're a minute and 30 into the bit.  Do we get to what did we learn for that day first?  Are you hiding liquor bottles right now in the hamper?  He's hiding liquor bottles.  Chris wants to know if Linda Lovelace got rear-ended. 
[02:20:30]  All right, Rick.  Go have another Bud Light.  Fine.  Rick's beer of choice today.  All right.  Back to the bit.  I think it's down near Lackawanna.  Oh.  Who cares?  I love Buffalo, but who cares?  Let's get Linda Lovelace's sister.  Oh, what happened to my music?  We were jamming, man.  We were rocking.  I like that.  Anthony, breaking news.  We got Linda Lovelace's daughter.  Daughter?  No.  Sister.  I'm sorry. 
[02:21:00]  Sister on the phone.  Barbara Borman.  There's a very tragic story in the New York papers about Linda Lovelace, right?  Yeah.  She died.  She died, which is very sad.  Mm-hmm.  We're huge fans of porno.  Oh, stop it.  Well, I know later in life.  I know the whole story.  We'll get into it with Linda Lovelace's sister.  You know, later on in life, she didn't want anything to do with that.  We understand all that.  Even at the time, it seems that, you know, there were things going on that she wasn't  very happy with what she was doing.  Right.  Well, the papers are reporting that they don't have enough money to bury Linda Lovelace. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, she hung up.  See?  Because I said something stupid, right?  See?  I knew it, Opie.  Oh.  What did I say?  Hey, you can't say we're big fans of porno.  I knew she would hang up.  Very sensitive about that.  Very.  But then I, like, kind of question myself, we're two minutes into the bit, and we still  don't have the freaking sister on the phone.  And now I'm going to switch CD player.  Do you think it was the CD player?  There's a hum going on that I don't like. 
[02:22:00]  Does anyone remember what track this was?  I hope it's not in the recording.  Because now Ben's pissed, Rick's pissed, so we're on our own.  We're on our own.  You pissed off Ben and Rick.  So they just left the studio.  Hold on.  And Phil.  Let's see if the buzz is there first.  No, it won't be.  I know.  You sure?  Yeah, because besides car six going kaplooey today, CD1, shut up, Jim, has a buzz.  It had a buzz all day.  But did the...  Shut up, you asses.  Maybe check...  I hate CD1. 
[02:22:30]  It stinks.  All right.  All right.  Back to the Linda Lovelace sister thing.  I knew she would hang...  See?  No buzz.  Let me hear.  Let me hear.  No buzz.  Very sensitive about that.  Thank you.  Very.  Shut up.  You can't.  But then I like...  Very sensitive.  ...contracting myself real fast.  No, no.  That was enough.  You...  The way that family is, and the sister, forget about it.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you...  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:23:00]  I knew it.  That's why I was completely like playing like...  Why don't we do our little trick that we do?  I don't know.  Why don't we do the little trick thing?  Oh, boy.  Rick's trying to get her back on the phone.  That ain't gonna...  Why are we talking about our little trick thing?  I don't know.  We're three minutes into the tape.  Still, no Linda Lovelace sister.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  The big one that got away.  Oh.  The big one that got away. 
[02:23:30]  We were gonna pay for a funeral, man.  I know.  Jesus.  Well, let's just wait.  Oh, wait.  She's back.  Barbara.  Barbara.  Hello.  Hi.  Are you mad at us?  I am not interested in speaking about Linda Lovelace and the pornography.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Well, I heard a little laugh, and it upsets me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There was no one laughing.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, we laugh at stupid things, but we weren't laughing.  No, nothing like that.  I'm very familiar with the story, as a matter of fact. 
[02:24:00]  We were just trying to explain to people who she was.  That's all.  Yeah.  We understand the family's stance on this whole thing.  That she was basically assaulted.  That's how that...  Got that right.  ...what that amounted to.  The woman did not want to do this, and she was taken advantage of and spent the rest of  her life as an advocate for people put in the same situation.  Yes, she did.  And now, she just recently died on Monday, I guess.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  And it was three weeks after a car accident. 
[02:24:30]  She had a horrific car accident.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  It seems like, I think, a tie rod...  It's under investigation.  It seems that I was told that the tie rod broke, and her seatbelt broke.  The car rolled over three or four times, and she was thrown about 38 feet out of the windshield.  Oh, jeez.  She broke both legs, shattered elbows, and pelvis.  Now, what was...  She was in, I guess, financial straits here, it seems... 
[02:25:00]  She died penniless.  Penniless.  So, um...  And if you would like to have people send to a fund that's being sent up for her...  Yeah.  ...I can give you that information.  Well, how much does a funeral cost?  How much have they...  I have no idea.  You have no idea?  No.  She is...  Well, aren't you guys burying her tomorrow?  Tomorrow is her funeral.  She's being cremated.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  And what do you need money for?  Because we would like to...  It's not me. 
[02:25:30]  It's what's been set up for her grandchildren.  Oh.  Oh, see, it sounded like they...  Because we're reading Linda Lovelace, kin, can't afford her burial.  Well, my father's out there to help her.  Oh, okay.  Well, we kind of wanted to pay for the funeral for the gal.  Well, that's pretty darn nice.  Well, so you have enough money to bury her?  Honey, I'm in Florida.  I don't...  I'm not there, and I don't want to go there. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, why not?  Because I'd rather remember the way she was and the wonderful times we had together.  My father is there.  Right.  And her son is coming home.  He's due in tonight.  He's in the National Guard.  And his daughter is there, too.  I mean, her daughter.  Is it that you don't have the means to go, or you just would rather not go?  Both.  You know, it's pretty expensive to go out, and I'm just going to stay home and grieve with myself. 
[02:26:30]  There you go.  Do you...  In my heart, I feel better right here.  Do you have any...  Have any...  Has anyone had any contact with that first husband of hers?  What?  That idiot?  Yeah.  Chuck Traynor?  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  No one has had any contact with him.  No one?  And no one is trying to...  He hasn't tried to contact anybody now that she's died?  I'm sure not.  Interesting.  Any memories of Linda Lovelace you'd like to share with our audience this afternoon, Barbara? 
[02:27:00]  As my youngest sister, she was my baby doll.  I was 16 when she was born.  She was a beautiful little girl.  A very happy little girl.  And then all hell broke loose.  But she and I were always very close.  Yeah.  And I wish to remember the memories of that.  Yeah.  And I can give you another call out there. 
[02:27:30]  Want to help with expenses or what?  Yeah, we would like to do something.  Yes.  Nice for Opie.  Linda Lovelace.  Opie.  Yes.  We would.  So what is...  A fund is being set up.  Yes.  And this fund is for?  Linda Lovelace Memorial Fund is going to be set up in lieu of flowers into an account for 
[02:28:00]  her grandchildren's college fund.  Right.  And, uh...  Uh...  Well, now here's another nip here.  Her funeral expenses are being covered.  Oh, oh, they are?  They are.  They are.  Uh...  I'm just reading my notes from her sister-in-law.  Uh...  Her first, um...  Yeah.  Let me call it check.  Oh, good.  So...  She was on disability and it came the day after she died. 
[02:28:30]  But anyway, she has a sister-in-law out there who's, um, handling all of this and doing  very well.  But she has said that people are calling her and wanting to donate and so on.  Yeah.  So, if you want to, I'll give you the account number and the name of the bank.  Well, we shouldn't, uh, you know, have that kind of information, uh, put out on here, I  don't think.  But is there a phone number, perhaps, or, uh, uh, somewhere where people might be able  to get in touch and send a donation? 
[02:29:00]  Are you...  Are you okay?  You can send a donation to me and I can forward it.  Okay.  If you want to.  That's entirely up to you.  Right.  Well, um...  I can give you the...  The name of the bank.  The name of the bank.  Yeah, let's, uh, let's, uh, give out the name of the bank.  Uh, if you're just tuning in, Linda Lovelace, um, uh, died tragically in a car accident  on Monday.  And we're just, uh, there's a fund.  And we got Barbara on the phone.  Her, uh...  Yeah.  Her loving sister.  You're the older sister? 
[02:29:30]  Yes, I am.  Ah.  We lost another 14 years again.  Anyway, are you ready for this?  Uh, yes, yes.  All right.  Andrew, you owe me a thousand.  Yes.  It's Wells Fargo Bank.  Okay.  Five-O-Five-O.  South Federal Boulevard.  Mm-hmm.  Englewood, Colorado.  Okay.  Eight-zero-one-one-zero. 
[02:30:00]  Barbara, you all right?  I'm all right.  Yeah.  Cindy, where's the account number?  Is this it?  Yes.  Okay.  Account number is 861-832-8832.  Oh, Hunter.  Oh, yeah.  Give it to her.  Okay.  And I want to thank everybody from coast to coast, north and south, who have called here  and their condolences.  Right.  And she was a lovely girl.  I bet, Barbara.  Well, thank you so much for spending a few minutes with us today. 
[02:30:30]  Thank you.  And giving us a little remembrance of Linda.  And when she was advocating, I wish you could have heard her speeches.  They were unbelievable.  Yeah.  And she did a great job.  Mm, stick it in my mouth.  You know.  Yeah.  She'll be a legend.  That's so great.  I bet.  I bet.  Well, best of luck to you, Barbara.  Thank you very much.  I think Barbara really needs to give out that account number again.  Do you think? 
[02:31:00]  Did we get it?  Just the account number once again.  All right.  I'm sorry, Barbara.  That's okay.  861-832-8838.  Penises.  Okay.  Thank you very much, Barbara.  Okay.  Thank you for calling.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Where do I hand in my membership card to the human race?  Do I just burn it or do I have to turn it back in? 
[02:31:30]  Do I have to turn it in?  Do I have to give it to somebody?  Or do I just wait for it to expire?  Holy Jesus!  Whew.  That was awful.  Uh, Bobo, yes.  Guys.  Yes, Bobo.  How do you do that?  How does she not hang up the phone on you?  Oh, my God.  How does she?  Does she hear what's going on?  Maybe her hearing's a little bad today. 
[02:32:00]  Hey.  On the cringe list?  Yeah.  That might be up there in the top three.  All right, Bobo.  Thank you.  Later.  That was very tragic.  Uh, Richie, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  Did she get disability for Lockjaw?  All right.  Look, look.  Barbara doesn't want her sister remembered in that light.  Right.  It's not Linda Lovelace.  It was Linda Borman.  And, uh, you know, she doesn't want her remembered in that light.  That's why she hung up so quickly when I hope you even brought up the porno.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's just not, um, not right. 
[02:32:30]  That wasn't good.  No.  Well, I hope a lot of our listeners will send money at least.  I don't know if I could even recover from her.  That poor woman.  I feel awful.  But, all right.  I think she thought I was, uh, upset or crying at one point because I was making sounds like  I couldn't take it anymore. 
[02:33:00]  It's always a surprise which sound clips you'll come up with.  And which ones are sitting over here.  Man, I'm not doing anything wrong today.  Huh?  What?  There's something wrong with you today.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  I want to make a donation.  I feel so touched by all the movies I've seen.  Yeah.  But the sperm bank closed and I can't get in here until Monday.  All right.  Okay.  No, no.  All right.  That's all right.  Hey, uh, and I think we need to regroup.  What?  We do?  Wow. 
[02:33:30]  Who pissed you off today?  No.  That was really good.  I don't know why I'm so entertained by stuff like that because it is so completely horrific  and horrible.  I don't know.  I just find it very entertaining.  Where did you find the zipper sound effect?  I didn't do that.  It must have been you.  Okay, right.  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention.  Well, I'm a virgin.  Hey!  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:34:00]  A four-hour parade of meat.  I think it's about time to play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  John from PA.  I learned that our Rick is a drunken Rick.  Right.  Mr. Blonde from Belmont, New York, writes, I learned Willie Mammoth are a type of eloquent.  Eloquent.  Oh, nice. 
[02:34:30]  I must say, we had a lot of fun this week on the radio.  Oh, hell yeah.  Next week is going to be Off the Hook Yo.  Off the Hook Yo.  We're going to be in Philly on Thursday, D.C. on Friday.  We love when people hang outside the studio when we come to your city.  Because it's a party, Anthony.  And then we drag some up.  We send people down to hang with them.  Chicks.  We mingle.  Right. 
[02:35:00]  And a couple special things.  In Philly, when we're there on Thursday, looking once again for you to bring the strangest,  wildest, craziest, oddest thing down to the studio, down to the station.  Yeah.  If we think it's really wild, we'll invite you in.  We'll talk to you a little bit.  And the grand prize, when we're in Philly, they're going to win a meet and greet with  Kid Rock and a guest, you and a guest, autographed guitar and front row seat, sorry, to the  show that Thursday night, May 9th in Philly, Anthony.  And D.C. has come up with a prize because we're going to do the same thing in D.C. on 
[02:35:30]  Friday.  Where is that prize?  Drunken Irish Earl from Long Island, totally calling you out.  What?  On a what did we learn.  He goes, I learned that when Opie answers in regards to road trips, ah, we're working  on something kind of big, that means no time soon.  Oh, Sacramento, we're working on something kind of big.  I want to enjoy.  No time soon.  We want to enjoy part of our summer. 
[02:36:00]  We are so booked this summer, it's ridiculous.  I know.  We're trying to figure it out.  All right, here's the grand prize for D.C., Anthony, as you bring the crazy, strangest,  wildest thing down to the studio when we're broadcasting in D.C.  Friday.  Two nights, three-day trip for two to Hollywood to attend an exclusive end-of-tour party with  Poison at the Roxy Theater.  Poison?  Rah!  Rah!  Poison will play a very intimate set followed by an evening of schmoozing with the winners.  Intimate set.  Intimate?  No, that's good. 
[02:36:30]  No, I'm not.  Believe me, I'm not talking about you.  An intimate set.  What does that mean?  A couple of people, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  Okay.  As opposed to?  All right.  Trip is courtesy of VH1 Classic, the new 24-hour music network.  So that's what you have to look forward to.  Right!  As the grand prize in D.C. when we're there.  Friday!  We'll be talking about music.  I've got to plug my brother here.  The Journey band that he's with, Evolution.  Yeah.

[02:37:30]  You know?  It's upstate by Albany, isn't it?  By Albany.  Well, we're heard in Albany.  It's somewhere up there.  Somewhere up there.  And you're pointing up, Opie.  That's very good.  Somewhere up there and a little to the right, I think.  I know maps.  Look at the picture.  From almostjourney.com.  See?  Your brother's like, take the goddamn picture.  My brother's kind of got his head out.  Look at how you go.  Steve Perry looking like him, sounding like him.  All kidding aside, they sound great.  Yeah.  They really do.  So check that out.

[02:38:00]  game.  Todd also learned a fireplug with pigtails around it makes Norton's heart sing.  He also learned Kart 6 went kablooey.  And Tyson is 36 going on 36.  Sheep Lover.  I learned today Go F Yourself is a new sponsor.  Al Mack.  I learned only in this country can a thin-lipped, weak-chinned, meaty-breasted zilch go from American  dummy to the blockbuster Spider-Man. 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  Really?  What a jump.  That's a good one, Al Mack.  Sheep Lover learned today the moon is a natural satellite.  Very good.  And the only one we have.  Jerry, I learned Paul Shanley invented the...  That's a tough one.  Oh, that is a tough one.  What is it?  Kiss.  I didn't learn that.  The kiss confessional.  Oh, the kiss confessional.  See, now that everyone's stealing our what-do-we-learned bit, now we're going to have to mix it up and  make it a little different. 
[02:39:00]  Ah, it's like quizzing us.  And the listeners fill in the, you know...  Jesus.  Fill in the space at home there.  We have to.  We've got to keep changing because people are on our tails constantly, Anthony.  That's tough.  We're not stupid, Boston.  We know where you got it from, you asses at jamming.  Jerry from Medicine.  Tom.  From me.  Tom now has more free time for...  Drinking.  And?  Sex with his wife and other women.  Threesomes.  Okay. 
[02:39:30]  Haywood from Yonkers.  Phew, I got it.  I learned Opie does not go to the movies to see...  Anyone?  Bueller?  Biter Man.  Suck it.  That's what we'll do.  Suck it.  We'll have everyone in to try to figure it out.  To try to quiz.  Okay.  Does not go to the movies to see...  Pretty Things.  Pretty Things.  Ah, that's kind of rough, dude.  Come on.  Well, not all of them.  I like this format because it makes me realize how stupid some of these are.  Tim, what's going on? 
[02:40:00]  Gentlemen, how are I?  I learned two things today.  Yeah.  Number one, the African eloquents have the small ears and the Indians have the big ears.  No.  No, African eloquents have big ears.  All right.  So I asked if I got it wrong.  Don't explain it.  I also learned that in about two minutes, Ben's going to be holding up a sign to say,  Get the F off.  Wow.  You're good.  But actually, it's only about a minute.  All right.  Very good.  Be good, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned a few things, guys.  First, Rick's sobriety is merely a facade. 
[02:40:30]  Paul Shanley will not be touring with Kiss.  Linda Lovelace had either a blown tire or a bad head gasket.  And listen, guys, I'm going away next week, and I won't get a chance to call.  Now, I know the 19th is special to you, Anthony.  So either happy anniversary or happy swallow day or whatever it is to you.  You are good, my friend, Chris.  Wow.  Later, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Yeah, I was thinking that, that many people are going to remind me of my old wedding anniversary. 
[02:41:00]  Well, you forgot it.  Since I forgot it in court, and it had to be printed in major metropolitan newspapers.  Let's go to Awesome Andy.  Swallow's Day coming up, though.  That's kind of exciting.  No, that was March.  March 19th.  May 19th.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Anniversary.  Man, I was...  I...  Wow.  I almost said something, and for once, I thought about it before I said it.  You did?  Woo!  Woo-hoo!  You would have had a sound bite, my friend.  Yeah, huh?  Awesome, Andy.  What's up? 
[02:41:30]  Hey, I learned it's too bad that Mike Tyson wasn't around during the Cro-Magnon era, so  he could have clubbed his date over the head and brought him to a hotel room.  In the caveman days.  Hey, five great shows this week.  Have a good weekend, guys.  Yeah, we did all right this week.  Definitely.  I'm going to pat myself on the back.  Ow.  There you go.  He's really patting himself on the back.  It's about time we had five good ones.  I know.  Usually it's three or four.  Ah, the second you give them a bad one, they'll come right back at us and remember it.  How can next week suck with the Opie and Anthony money smash game? 
[02:42:00]  I'm so looking for it.  And hitting the road in Philly and D.C. this week.  Jonathan.  Yo.  What's up?  We'll end with you.  What the hell?  What's up?  Make it good.  If I said Sacramento sucks, they wouldn't get mad for three hours.  And that's how we end this week.  Great.  Thank you, Jonathan.  You guys talk.  All right.  Peace.  Peace.  All right.  There we go.  We're out.  Nice week.  And we'll see you.  See you next week.  We'll see you next week. </pre>
