<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their controversial on-air personas and the pressure to be “nice,” contrasting this with personal anecdotes: Opie’s sleep problems due to sugar and salt, and Anthony’s frustrating encounter with road construction.  They then critiqued the Knicks' disastrous 59-point loss to the Celtics, speculating on Coach Isaiah Thomas' future.  A brief discussion of a Cowboys-Packers game and Anthony's expensive cable bill followed.  The hosts then reviewed *Revolver*, praising Jason Statham and Ray Liotta despite finding the plot confusing. Opie admitted to playing online poker while watching the film.  They also mentioned an Angus Young online auction.

Listener calls followed, covering topics ranging from hockey scores (Rangers vs. Islanders) to *Revolver*'s convoluted plot. One call prompted Opie to recount layoffs at his former Rochester radio station, reflecting on job insecurity in the industry.  Further listener calls and stories about fishing, including a humorous anecdote about a seagull on a hook, filled out this segment, punctuated by crude humor and sexually suggestive references.  Jason Statham, despite being expected, did not appear as a guest.

The next segment focused on hunting and fishing, sparked by a caller's comment about the perceived difference between hunters and fishermen. Graphic descriptions of killing various animals ensued, including a caller's traumatic deer hunting experience that ended his hunting career.  A lengthy and humorous Ted Nugent impression was performed. The discussion expanded to include the ethics of hunting, particularly trophy hunting, and the brutality of certain fishing practices, with comparisons drawn to the show's former personalities "Retarded Laverne and Charlie."  A caller recounted a brutal striped bass killing, and another described feeding earthworms to fish.

Guy Ritchie, director of *Revolver*, then joined the show. He defended the film's complex narrative, discussed the casting of Statham and Liotta (including Liotta's nude scene), the use of chess as a metaphor, and the challenges of accents in film.  Audio of Tony La Russa's drunk driving arrest, highlighting his inability to recite the alphabet, was played.  Upcoming guests, including Dennis Leary, were mentioned.  Listener calls were interspersed throughout. Coke Logic animations were referenced.

The show continued with a discussion of *Revolver*, followed by a promotion for Jim Norton's New Year's Eve show. Chuck Nice joined the studio, reminiscing about past appearances, including a humorous anecdote involving using Black people to scare a staff member.  He discussed his current work on "Cinema Therapy."  Football picks, sponsored by Dish Network, were made.

A caller, Luis Baez, then challenged the official 9/11 narrative, leading to a lengthy debate on conspiracy theories. Baez accused the hosts of parroting the mainstream media, becoming increasingly agitated before ultimately hanging up, calling the hosts “cowards.”  The hosts discussed the exchange and the possibility of a new 9/11 investigation.

A subsequent segment featured a heated confrontation with three "9/11 truthers," covering various conspiracy theories. The guests presented their arguments, while Opie and Anthony countered, often engaging in personal insults.  One guest left angrily. An eyewitness to the attacks then gave a counterpoint, followed by listener calls and a brief conversation with a caller named AJ Poopy Shits. The show also briefly promoted Jim Norton's New Year's Eve show and discussed a British teacher jailed in Sudan. A detailed discussion with a jet mechanic regarding the Pentagon impact concluded this segment.

The final segment began with a "line of the day" discussion and a farewell to a departing studio guest, Jimmy, who mentioned his upcoming project, "shilling." The hosts discussed a picture of a Nazi march, compared it to a school yearbook photo, and segued into a morbid discussion about death and the effects of bullets and fire on corpses.  The show then concluded with the hosts acknowledging their studio audience, mentioning the weather, joking about message boards, and plugging FH Riley's restaurant.  A humorous struggle to end the broadcast with Kenny pointing to a cue card concluded the show, followed by a discussion about received hoodies, jokes about body shapes, the playing of "Diana" by Martha Wash, and a final sign-off.

[00:03:00]  and i just like  i i get up  i have to go to the bathroom  i'm like don't get up to go to the bathroom  because it's gonna wake your body up  like just lay here fat boy  and then i get up  you itch  from salt  yeah because he's getting you know  is that what that is  bloating  bloating me  you're bloating  oh yeah if you have too much salt  you just bloat  period girl  and i came  i came home last night  they're doing construction  right by the by  where open i live  so i had to  it's just a nightmare getting home  i had to go the wrong way  to the one way street  and beg forgiveness  from like the guy who is  guarding everything 
[00:03:30]  i  it was a non-story  as i was saying that  i realized there's no end to this  i'm going nowhere  it's just like  ah it's everyday crap though  it's funny because anthony goes  i don't know much about basketball  but i think 59 points is not good  i was like i know nothing about basketball  i was like  i think the knicks were bad  let me tell you how  you got 59 points  never good  the headline  the sports headline  what a joke  and uh  i gotta tell you something man  i'm a knicks fan  uh sort of  i i don't even pay attention 
[00:04:00]  to the team anymore  it's gotten so bad  i can't remember the last time  the knicks had a good team  that at this point  i'm sort of a knicks fan  sort of  know what team i like  what  maybe i'm jumping on a bandwagon  Celtics  yeah  Celtics are amazing this year  i was going to say that  and that's why i bring this  uh up to everybody today  the the knicks scored 59 points  the Celtics scored 104  it was a 45 point defeat  last night  45 point  now that doesn't happen a lot  in professional  and  nba basketball 
[00:04:30]  is this true  and then follows uh  hoops probably more than i do  and what  the knicks like threw one in  from half court  to  to what  yeah uh  there was two seconds left  the announcers were all saying  well it looks like  they are going to get  the knicks will achieve  the record  for lowest  uh point total  for the franchise  yeah  and  unfortunately  or fortunately  uh somebody  sunk a buzzer beater  from half court  to give them  one more point  than the worst point record  so  high fives all around 
[00:05:00]  at the knicks bench  i hate to say it  i think isaiah thomas  has to go  yeah  yeah  i don't know anything about  did he use the b word again  we didn't want  i didn't want him to go  just because of that  sexual harassment crap  but i think now he has to go  because i think  he's just not getting  the job done  if he did sexually harass  that ugly broad  he should be fired  he's terrible looking  yeah it's hard to believe  but go select him  i said  celtics beat the knicks  by 45 points  and what do we got  cowboys beating the packers  last night 
[00:05:30]  oh did they  i couldn't find that game  oh big fan you are  dude i'm not gonna say  that i'm not a naughty boy  but we were saying  how much  a naughty boy  a cowboys fan you are  yeah but i looked  i was at the  the comedy channel  and up on the tvs  there's another game  actually wasn't it on  like nfl network  or some weird channel  that a lot of people  don't get  it was only on the  nfl network channel  oh all right  is that a special channel  you gotta get  yeah as part of packages  some deal fell through  this cable company  part of package  let me tell you something  my cable bill is well over  200 freaking bills a month 
[00:06:00]  is it on my package  i don't think so  you have a big package  thank you  you know  apparently even when you  you pay a lot for cable  you're not getting  everything  you still don't  oh and you're under  the assumption that  you're getting everything  like i think i get  everything and then  people go oh do you  see this it's on you  know this channel  i go i don't get that  i thought i maxed out  but when i go through  my cable it's like uh  call this number to  subscribe call this  number to subscribe  call this number to  subscribe channel  after channel  after channel  after channel 
[00:06:30]  i thought i should have  everything for what i pay  i'm gonna start  downsizing because i  i don't watch any of  the movies  no no  yeah i still do  movies on demand you  can find a movie on that  crap yeah because sometimes  i just pick an older movie  that i've seen before  they hold back all the  good movies  like okay here's  here's uh here's an easy  one it's christmas time  right  why wouldn't movies on  demand or hbo on demand  any one of these channels  just have a whole list of  like christmas movies you  could choose from  why wouldn't they do that  they just don't 
[00:07:00]  that makes sense  i think it's yeah they  buy a certain amount of  rights every month for  yes uh jimmy norton yes  they don't have a list of  christmas movies  because they suck  no  what  um  oh no  oh no  um  quick  oh no  because they didn't buy  the rights  i was just like because  they suck  what is wrong with you  how much popcorn did you  eat last night  i thought i was gonna say  they don't have a list for  christmas movies because  no one's paying attention  to christmas with new 
[00:07:30]  years right around the  corner  oh  and uh jimmy norton  uh tickets on sale  oh no  for his no  north fork theater  north fork theater  i was really gonna say  the tickets go on sale  at 9 a.m  that's not what i was  gonna say honestly god  i was gonna say because  they suck  yeah  when you said  why they suck  i was like oh think  quick  and i just blanked out  i finally saw the  departed we were talking  about this last week  and i thought it was  it was just okay  i thought the the cast  was amazing i thought  the storyline was really  good but i i just felt  like they missed the mark  but this is stupid 
[00:08:00]  why are we talking  about the departed  a year later you know  but i finally got around  to seeing the dumb movie  i'll tell you the best  guy in the departed  was martin sheen  martin sheen was amazing  i liked martin sheen  in that  yeah  i liked him flying out the  window  that was good  yeah  when he took the old  concrete in the teeth  i'd like that in real life  to tell you the truth  can't stand that do-gooder  really  shut up  i like  stop taking sledgehammers  to missile silos  friggin 2007  he hasn't done that in years  oh he still gets on the  bandwagon chains himself  to something stupid  just launch it

[00:09:00]  in the cowboys  victory  but he's saying  he's going to play  next week  that's good of him  he can't win in  dallas  i'm just  in the silence  what a great move  it was getting  owens right  that troublemaker  yeah he's good  he's been  i think he's the  difference  turned that whole  freaking team around  yep  all right  yeah i know  myspace voodoo  is running wild  we like that  yeah  and it's all  because one  ass hater  saying enough  with you saying  myspace voodoo  so that's what i do

[00:10:30]  week  yeah  uh i was up  watching the um  the uh guy richie  movie  we all got our  screener copies  of revolver  of revolver  it's got jason  statham who i  think is a really  cool good actor  he's been in here  he's been in here  he's a great guy  yeah  been here at 8  like him  well i don't know  he took the red  eyes so they're  hoping he'll get  here in time  yeah that's what  we're hearing  but in other words  uh we just have  guy richie today  that's what i'm  thinking  i think that's  what's gonna  happen  but we'll see  the excuses  have already  started flowing in 
[00:11:00]  so who knows  we'll see  stupid publicists  think we're not  onto their game  yeah  well let's see  maybe he'll come  yeah we'll see  and uh yeah  we watched that  uh last night  not all together  like you know  the beatles in a  hard day's night  we weren't uh  you know all  hanging out in  the room  we're like charlie's  family and willie  in the show  where we just all  sit around in a  bed together  with our stocking  caps on  bunch of rods  torn dirty  jammies  yeah so uh we 
[00:11:30]  all watched it  um and uh  what'd you think  oh  it was um  interesting  yeah  can i say  the thing with  the problem is  it was kind of  hard to follow  it really was  like and i'm  good at movies  like uh  with twists and  stuff like that  but yeah  this was it was  a tough one to  follow  it was  well know what  i told anthony  that well if we're  gonna talk openly  what the hell  i uh told anthony 
[00:12:00]  in the office  i go  well it was one  of those movies  where i'm kind  of watching like  all right cool  all right there's a  gang and that  guy's a big wig  casino he's  getting out of  jail all right  man i can get  into this and i'm  kind of just  watching and then  20 minutes into  the movie i go  oh no i think i  was supposed to  pay way more  attention than i  am oh no a  few things slipped  by me and there's  no going back  because we had  screener copies it  wasn't easy to  rewind anyone i  couldn't do the  rewind really  because jason 
[00:12:30]  statham had this  huge monologue and  i'm like i think i  was supposed to  pay attention to  that i think  that set up  everything see  but i don't  think that's uh  true because i  paid strict  attention right  the entire time  from beginning to  end i really made  a point because uh  the beginning really  like wrote me in  right i like the  whole thing jason  statham he's getting  out of prison it's  uh you know  they're putting  quotes up on the  screen uh from  uh throughout history 
[00:13:00]  about um things  like warfare and  strategy and  games and gaming  and things like  that so i'm like  okay this this is  kind of cool i like  where this is going  right from the  start and and  then as the movie  went on i was just  kind of like uh  all right i i i'm  i'm enjoying this  i'm enjoying the  ride i but i'm  getting this sinking  feeling that the  destination is going  to be i'm going to  be dropped off in 
[00:13:30]  the middle of the  desert somewhere  left to look at  the credits roll  going what what  the what but what  happened didn't you  yell at your uh tv  don't do it i said  i was yeah i went  don't do it don't  do it i don't want  to see a credit i  went oh there are  the credits oh  jesus no i'm left  trying to figure this  out now now i'm  laying there and i  know i gotta go to  sleep because we  gotta get up in an  ungodly hour for  this show and i'm 
[00:14:00]  kind of going oh  my god why but  what but but at  one point uh uh my  girlfriend kind of  goes she goes are  are you lost and i  went yes i'm lost  and um i was indeed  lost but then you  hope much like when i  first watched pulp  fiction that it all  ties up at the end  somehow i think it's  one of those movies  you guys see a  second time i really  do i following your 
[00:14:30]  thought there i consider  myself a pretty  intelligent guy i like  to figure things out i  like puzzle solving and  that type of thing right  and um i was getting so  lost that i was getting  so mad that i actually  felt my brain kind of  like short you're getting  like hot and and my  whole body got hot  because i it was  started short  circuiting i'm like i  can't freaking follow  this i can't figure this  out so then i got so  like worked up i went  on the computer and  started i started  playing full tilt as  the movie's still 
[00:15:00]  playing i thought you  were gonna say you  went on the computer to  uh like look into the  movie no no because  i've done that i've  looked into other  people's opinions on  the movie no i knew i  just had to get away  from it but i was still  watching and then i was  i was so worked up and  so mad that i'm just  messing up everyone's  poker games online last  night i'm like i got  like a two seven off  shoot and i'm going all  in and i go all in and  i get a flush on the  last three cards i'm  playing omaha for the  people that really know  cards and and i'm all  in on the worst hand you  could possibly go all in  on yeah right away too 
[00:15:30]  right away it was my  first hand in the game  that angers people well  that's what i was  except master poe so  everyone good hand the  cards that came out  everyone's like oh my  god this guy's an idiot  we'll just take his money  real fast and everyone  goes all in and i i hit  the flush uh the flush on  the last three cards  you sucked out yeah i and  yeah sucked out and all  sudden i you know the  chips come my way and  then you you watch the  screen go boing boing  boing boing sitting out  i cleared out the room  everyone leaves because  no one want to play with  that crap they don't want  to play with you no one 
[00:16:00]  wants to play with a guy  that has absolutely no  strategy they can figure  out so you you wait you  were trying to watch the  movie and play poker well  this was with about 20 to  30 minutes left because i  was so frustrated and then  there were no more booby  shots either so i'm like  all right well i can't even  want to sit around for booby  shots although the the the  the asian guy in the sauna  with the chick that's  uh topless and she had  the beer bottle right  between her legs and then  she would take the beer  bottle lift to drink yeah  she was holding it like  unfortunately the camera  would move up to her lips  right at that point yeah 
[00:16:30]  but that was a pretty damn  hot scene yeah she was  the one uh there was one  was she the same girl  that they show sitting in  a chair with her leg she's  wearing underwear she had  one leg draped over the  side of the chair and she  was licking a lollipop yeah  oh that was another one  that was another yeah  yeah it was a great up  the skirt shot it was very  sexy yeah i gotta be a  pretty cool like they had  some really cool scenes in  there i don't know i don't  know if it was a bad movie  i got i'm not gonna i'm not  gonna sit here and say the  movie sucked i don't know  it was filmed great a couple  of scenes were awesome the

[00:19:30]  i didn't fully understand at  the end of the movie and i'm  not ruining anything when  right before the credits roll  they have five or six  psychiatrists and psychologists  discussing things discussing  you try to wrap it up right  they're kind of like going back  and forth and talking that to  me was like oh okay they kind of  screen this uh people didn't get  it so they throw in his  explanations from these  psychiatrists on things like

[00:20:30]  turned him on to the movie  tim in pennsylvania what's up  hey boys hey i just want to say  you know whenever i watch a movie  and i find myself thinking about  the next day going through it  that to me is is made it worth my  money i think it's a good movie if  i think about it the next day some  of the movies you watch and you  completely forget about but yeah  you're talking about it maybe that  means that it adds something to it  i usually get online and uh this  movie isn't out uh so you know i  usually get online though and uh  look on imdb and try to get other 
[00:21:00]  people's comments and what they  thought the movie was about when it's  a movie that i'm like huh what like  the first time i watched donnie darko  i was like okay what the hell was  that about and how to go online and  went online and kind of you know  figure it out so i guess that is kind  of cool when you get a movie that  well the next day you're still  figuring out what the hell was going  on no one movie confused the hell  out of me memento now i mean  everyone knows memento now but when  it first came out you're like what  and and there were no movies that

[00:24:00]  fine company apple is apple i was in  uh san francisco and you know i was  having problems with my iphone no it was  for a long time though i don't know i  didn't drop it i promise i wasn't able  to hear and i picked it up until i had  my bluetooth in so i go in san francisco  but yeah maybe you guys could look at  this and uh it was so cute that they  said well the store is busy because i'm  used to being here in new york where the  store is truly busy you know san  francisco's was you know 50 people i  laughed at them yeah and the guy  looked at it he's like yeah there's  something with it all right we'll get  a new one really he takes me looks at 
[00:24:30]  my id make sure that i'm legit and uh  within a half hour i got a brand new  phone he just handed it to me and it  was all uh did they uh transfer all the  info um no i had gone back to the hotel  across oh so you just synced back up  probably would have yeah but i didn't  ask him to but uh i did it myself that  easy no crap no paperwork just show id  make sure right anyone else getting  uh what was uh i was trying to apple is  just uh wow sweetie what am i trying to  say this are you getting the impression 
[00:25:00]  that apple's kind of changing the way  businesses uh do business yeah i mean  they're like i mean they're way better at  customer service than than pretty much  everybody right yeah i mean you get that  personal touch with apple when was the  last time you felt that personal touch  with a company or a product it seems like  apple's really changing things around a  little bit and people started to follow  their lead the guy at the front of the  store when i walked in and told him i had  a problem like yeah i got something my  iphone is like what's the matter i just 
[00:25:30]  like well i'm having problems hearing it  he goes well did you check your setting  this is the guy at the front to show you  people like when you walk in so he's  let me see your phone so he looks at it  he goes into general settings and he's  poking around and he goes all right well  you might want to take it upstairs because  he couldn't figure out what but the guy  tried to help me in the front of the  store did he say i delete some of these  before you give this phone back to me  or the police may be involved you know he  said something about are you a substitute  teacher i'm like let it go no but i did  have to give my uh my phone over and i  forgot that there's a picture that i had 
[00:26:00]  actually taken uh of my genitals and i  put it under the name anthony cumia so  hey i told the aunt one day i'm like aunt  call me and he called me and i held the  phone up and it was just let's just say  just a lovely phone filling photo yes and  uh i forgot that was on that was still in  there yeah thanks that would be great to  do instead of everyone you know taking a  picture so when that person calls you see  their face it's like you make everyone take  your phone and take a picture of their junk 
[00:26:30]  so every time the phone rings and you can't even go with  your friend oh patrice or neil's calling me  it's a little embarrassing well black but  small than you'd expect patrice how are you  no you can do uh you can use some of that myspace voodoo  see what's from the uh from the take a certain  angle i make your uh your unit look uh  lighting well i gotta be lighting and shading  and makeup i i did do that um it's all for me if you  take a photo if you're gonna take a photo of  junk if you're standing up and you're aiming down that 
[00:27:00]  puts everything in the foreground like it just  looks like there's this massive mountain object and  everything else is tiny in comparison so that's what i did and  boy it looks lovely and it's on your phone of  course as it should be what am i gonna do put it in  somewhere else what what am i a goose what's the  matter with you is it on my phone is it on my phone there  you go and take a look oh god jimmy i've seen it live i've  seen it live yeah the only part that wrecks it though is 
[00:27:30]  that it's not just the junk uh yeah there's a little more  there sticking out so it just kind of looks silly it  it looks like silly i'm strangling myself  all right what else is going on well we got rodney uh rodney king got  shot uh what the that news broke early uh  yesterday afternoon well yeah do we know why uh  corner he was on a street corner shotgun to the face he's okay he  actually rode home and then called what the paramedics or something face  and arm he got hit with a shotgun and then uh 
[00:28:00]  he hopped on his bicycle yeah from what i hear he's actually  learned yeah he's got some sense and uh probably not a driver's license  and uh rode it back to some apartment or a place he lives whatever and there  were a few other people there when the police arrived uh they said not many  people were very cooperative with uh trying to get the the story of who  shot him and things like that they think it was a domestic right  uh yeah something like that well he was arrested back in 2005 for a  domestic um argument domestic abuse 
[00:28:30]  and uh he uh he called the police from his house i'm sure uh that was  when you're shot with a shotgun i'm sure you're happy to see the police at that  point so uh yeah he called the cops and they  took him to the hospital and they're saying non-life-threatening  bounds they're probably real nice to him when they show up oh yes sir okay the cop  tape puts a chauffeur cap on drives him where would you like to go 
[00:29:00]  anywhere okay the hospital good uh  the guy i don't know this one i and i read it on uh on fark right you know  fark.com sure and uh a lot of people comment on the stories on fark so i went  there and it was nothing but um like some real blatant racist things  were written on there but the the main argument was uh the  cops um suck for what they did by beating  him and then the other side was rodney king 
[00:29:30]  is a piece of crap who deserved everything he got  and uh that was that pretty much went back and forth  i love how people try to convince each other on message boards have you ever once  especially in a impassioned uh argument like like things of race and  the war things like that have you ever seen someone change their mind on a  message board just doesn't happen it doesn't happen it just goes back and  forth until it just degenerates into a f you you suck your mother whatever 
[00:30:00]  it's it's not really an open forum of of uh reasonable intelligent discussion  like like people dreamt about when uh the internet first popped on i guess  exchanging of ideas and thoughts that ain't happening i got my idea and  everyone should follow my yeah yeah that's how it works it's that's why  well once you're once you're a couple of posts deep in something you pretty much  have a gauge if this is going to be one of those conversations are you going to get  some intelligent feedback from somebody and then you just bail out  because even if you learn something from um somebody else 
[00:30:30]  you only you'll you'll only like change your uh  opinion on something just a little bit just a little you but you're not going to go  yeah yeah i'm now for the war right it's not going to happen you might see a  point or two but they're not going to like completely change you yeah your  mindset definitely and that's that uh hey moving on we got to talk about  tony la russa what happened i'm sorry i'm looking at rock uh stuff yeah like  because i wanted to buy some aussie stuff and then i realized it was all for rich 
[00:31:00]  people's houses the big ticket item they're selling these shirts on on ebay or  whatever uh for rock and there's a rolling stones 1973 goat's head soup uh  a shirt or whatever 4500 bucks i think it's going to get for a rock t-shirt  what did that go for like when the guy bought it well they think it was used in  promotion it was like a long sleeve sweater created to promote the album  there's only like 12 made oh well it was a that's different i thought maybe  somebody bought it on their way to the concert and  through their car window yeah why would you do that i mean they finally got the uh 
[00:31:30]  the concert t-shirts figured out where they they look vintage like i'm  wearing a grateful dead one and i get stopped all the time people like wow  where'd you get that what show i'm like i you know aj bought for me for my  birthday it's like four months old but people really think this shirt is like  10 15 years old you're gonna lie they finally got it figured out where they  date huh you're gonna lie pick a date of a  concert like the last one jerry played or something yeah that's not a bad idea  and then have a whole story about it whole bs story and then they'll rip it off my  body but no they got the vintage at first when they started like 
[00:32:00]  reprinting concert t-shirts they looked awful usually the the  material was just just itchy and and like just hard yeah now it's soft and  they look like uh you know they look like they're they're  what's wrong that's the matter jimmy i'm thinking vintage shirts you're talking  about itchy and i'm thinking like they're small  i'm touching my stomach and i hate it as you're talking you've lost so much weight  thank you but i'm talking about rock t-shirts and they always make you feel they 
[00:32:30]  always felt you out a little bit a rock t-shirt that's why they got to be soft  yeah because if they are a little tight and a little like hard material yeah it  just shows off a world of hurt every concert t-shirt i bought  back in the day would one washing and it was over johnny you'd have a midriff  midriff top i threw mine out i had a really cool one but you know i wouldn't  wear it now but it was like i used to think i was so cool in high school when i wore it  it had like an executioner and he was holding up just ozzy's bloody head  and it was like a diamond madman shirt i'm like i'm really dangerous 
[00:33:00]  i felt like i was like the girls would probably like being go wow he's mysterious  i have my full hairdo and my glasses did you ever buy something well that's a good uh  thing of buying something that you thought that you just bought because you thought it would look  cool and make people like go wow yeah that's cool uh i have probably a hugely embarrassing um  um example of that i was in the old remember modell's oh god modell's apartment store here in new york 
[00:33:30]  yeah this is i i it was probably still in high school i guess and um i saw a jacket this like what  the hell were those silk like jackets back then they're like every band had them like the silk jacket  with the logo on the back or something all right it was like kind of a silk feel to it but yeah  satin yeah satin i'm sorry silk yeah satin uh and it said on the back was a big wbab logo and i 
[00:34:00]  wanted to wear that so when i went into a club people thought i worked there what is wrong with you so  i bought that i worked there it was no big deal yeah but i didn't so how old were you fruit oh i was  probably like 18 or something and uh and i i wore it until like a week later the paint started  cracking off and the bap fell off really should have been wb oob because that's what you were it 
[00:34:30]  was a complete boob but then the odd thing goes i started working there so there you go that's how  radio works you buy the jacket first then you get the job i'm trying to find a cool nirvana shirt i've  been searching that out for years i don't like the nirvana stuff i'm trying to find a vintage nirvana  t-shirt i thought i was cool in my uh tango hats yes your tango hat uh picture uh fantastic you looked  so cool in it i had a red one a floppy one i'm embarrassed talking about this like i was i was 
[00:35:00]  believing i was a white homeboy before it was fashion it's humiliating to talk about like i don't  like talking about it but i had on this red floppy tango i look like i look like uh uh henry fonda  if they filmed on golden pond and compton my stupid tango and i'm i'm in i'm in the lunchroom  and i was just a clown i had my dumb glasses nobody liked me and uh some black kid came over and you  snatched it off my head like really well he should oh of course he should have slapped my face and 
[00:35:30]  watched it fall off but i grabbed it back up your cover what's that white side sir  and uh i snatched it back but it was out of embarrassment about my hair not being uh tough  and uh i just grabbed it back and he walks over and he goes oh you want to fight me oh no and i didn't  and i and this is what i said to him i'm like well if you wanted to see my hat why didn't you just  ask oh why didn't you just like like look i hate to administer this tough medicine but had you uh 
[00:36:00]  learned a little hat borrowing etiquette this could have been avoided  i suck oh the 80s were really bad too because uh uh i was in bands over over the years in the 80s and uh  uh i i remember buying and thinking it was just gonna be the cat's meow these uh zipper parachute 
[00:36:30]  pants i they had zippers everywhere i mean if you wanted to store something in your kneecap there was  a zipper there and i had a pair of those one down there and a uh a sweatshirt but the sleeves completely  cut off uh with a big like a japanese writing like letter on it i guess i don't know what it said it  was probably sent over from japan and said america is a americans are dorks i wouldn't have known you  wanted to play for rat so i thought that was cool and then what i did also was took uh five belts you 
[00:37:00]  know military belts they come in like olive drab and they got the buckle on the front little brass buckle  yeah they were like that but only they came in multi like neon colors so i got like a white and a  blue and a red and it's all different colors please tell me you try to hang yourself all at the same  time so well some slightly looser than the other so it was that and then it would hang like like 
[00:37:30]  off the hip a little bit uh yeah yeah yeah uh it was completely embarrassing who thought you were  cool me you know what look at i know what though it's embarrassing but looking back that was what  was happening oh it was not i was an ass you know what i uh know what i did in college but i couldn't  fully commit remember when um tails were popular what i grew like a tail oh no you had like the little 
[00:38:00]  rat tail but i couldn't really commit because because it was it was in so mine was about an  inch to an inch and a half long and it was and it was kind of tiny and i thought it was the coolest  dude walking in and out of the bars of geneseo with this dumb thing did you put a rubber band in it  no it was too small because like i said i couldn't completely commit it just like a piece of my hair  was just a little longer than everything else in the back like a banks cat you couldn't get a real tail 
[00:38:30]  it's a bobtail ope but i think i even knew how dumb it was because i couldn't fully commit and like  grow it out like you were supposed to back in the day and like oh oh it just it gives me chills thinking  about it thank god there's no pictures of that because you know no one takes a picture of the  back of your head so there will not be a picture of me and and a little tail not without photoshop  there won't someone on whack bag will do it exactly hey you ever associate yourself like with song  lyrics like like you think it was really cool if you played a song at a certain time and there was 
[00:39:00]  a girl by and she'd like look at you and think oh god were you sad i was i was i should have had a  big czm i shirt for captain zilch oh that is really sad and iraq keeps popping pictures up of  parachute pants with zippers sure oh are they awful they're actually there's no pants he's just aiming  the palatal camera into his lap yeah look at those you 80s nothing yeah let's go to uh north carolina 
[00:39:30]  it was cool they're nice asses though you had to have a nice ass in parachute pants oh who you are  of course let's go to north carolina i was talking to brother wheeze last night i said man i don't  know what it is with the opian anthony show but we got a massive audience in north carolina and south  carolina they're retards they call every day we get so many calls from the carolinas uh sean's a  faithful listener what do you got sean uh hey hey belt boy uh with all those belts and uh your dad thought 
[00:40:00]  you was a fruit uh no my dad at that point was in california so he didn't see him i wasn't gonna like  mail out pictures of me dressed like a fruit i was surprised you told that story because yeah  i was thinking the same thing like wow i wonder what your dad thought of the parachute pants and  the five belt oh no when i went out to california to visit him there was no parachute cowboy boots  and jeans well it was pretty much yeah jeans and uh and weaponry that was pretty much it no he never  saw me in the uh parachute pants and the belt what the hell kind of you know he'd be throwing the uh 
[00:40:30]  the f word for homosexual around oh i can't even say it i don't believe it don't get me started  today no things are going well so far i told you that my uh my dad it was so embarrassing my dad turned  me into a nerd because he told me he kind of made me look like i was cool on the back of our stupid  hatchback we'd go fishing once in a while and i sucked i could never catch anything oh and uh my friend  bill d'angelo and his father would be just catching like just you know the they would be like the the 
[00:41:00]  father and son fish catchery they should have opened up their own fish catching school and then and then  charged me and my dumb dad we would stand there it was almost like we didn't use bait it was like my  father and i tied a license plate to our line and threw it in and like and like bill and his dad had a  fish vagina behind the airline it was amazing i caught nothing building his fire oh no more fish 
[00:41:30]  get a new get a new net dad and me and my father standing there with an empty stupid cooler like with  a bunch of ice and no fish to put in it they were actually storing the the d'angelo's worms  they're filling up the boat with fish and you and your dad just sitting there we were just we were on  the shore that was even worse if we were on the boat we could have just sat in the boat and like  looked at one thing of fish in the middle like it was all of ours right bill and his father had one  bucket oh my father had another you know they were like father and son too going like look at that son 
[00:42:00]  look they can't catch any fish where we know how to fish their buckets upside down they're sitting  on us me and my dad are just sitting on our buckets using it as like portable toilet  lemons and make lemonade you're gonna be fishing it and my dad had a little uh i remember on the back of  our uh a car he had like a picture of a trout it was probably like 12 inches long it was it was a  bumper sticker and he goes i got that so when people drive by they know there's a fisherman on board  oh oh no do they dad do they where are you fish exactly what was the problem with your fishing i don't 
[00:42:30]  know were you guys using the lures or there was a new it was apparently a new bait called fish repellent  you'd catch more you'd catch more more mosquitoes with off than we caught fish with whatever i don't  know what happened to our worms we have like cancerous worms worms with brain stem cancer just  rotting on the end of the stupid fish avoided us okay so the the faggoty nortons again let's just 
[00:43:00]  avoid those two like just too flaccid were your worms just getting waterlogged the worms oh it's  terrible the worms were actually swimming over to uh to bill and his father's line just to get eaten  already they were tired of hanging out in the cold water it was humiliating there's a fisherman  on board that's too good not a fisherman on board i don't see our empty bucket they'll realize there's  an incompetent on board and his dad we just weren't mechanical the nortons all right that's sad that is 
[00:43:30]  sad we gotta take a break uh we teased the audio we gotta play next tony larussa pulled over for drunk  driving in march and this is finally coming out yeah sometimes these things take time wow you can't  even do the alphabet and we got the audio stay there it's opie and anthony  you're checking out the opie and anthony show  i need like 15 seconds this isn't going to mean any anything to most people listening right now but  i gotta acknowledge it i uh i started my radio career pretty much in uh rochester at wcmf 
[00:44:00]  and yesterday they let just about everybody go really guys i've uh i started with years and years  ago so i i wish nothing but the best uh to mark cronin who took me under his wing i was just a  an assistant promotion bird i was an assistant promotion douche that just drank seven days a  week and didn't know crap and he took me under his wing showed me the business he got let go after  like 30 years in rochester radio uh dave kane who i used to deliver pizzas for he did middays in 
[00:44:30]  rochester for 26 years and and i had to deliver pieces as one of his bits that he was doing i had  to hang out at office parks and hand out pizza and dump t-shirts and you're sad about this they  let him go jesus they let stand duties they let this guy p kennedy go that uh is a legend in rochester  he was there for well over 20 years a guy named ray noon who was a great sales uh guy he he got let 
[00:45:00]  go yesterday there's a lot of depression up in rochester they're gonna be parting their asses  off today and stan main uh my first program director that really truly taught me the business of radio  he was let go the brother weaves was able to keep his job but uh they let some of his staff go it was  just a bloodbath yesterday in rochester and i want to acknowledge that uh it's a sad day for a lot  of my uh my old friends why would they do that today couldn't they wait till january 1st well  jesus christ i mean i'm trying to think january it's radio christmas and stuff do they have to 
[00:45:30]  dump people who have kids right i mean i know i sound like some stupid public advocate but couldn't  they wait until a month until the holidays are over well what happened was no intercom bought the  cluster in rochester this is so inside but i i just gotta acknowledge this today and uh they bought  the cluster in rochester and you know they're trying to save a few uh a few shuckles so a lot  of uh guys that have been around a really really long time uh were let go yesterday so god almighty  that's that's bad so i just gotta acknowledge that because i started with all those guys years and years 
[00:46:00]  ago and uh it's a sad day for them and their family so yeah it does suck you just kind of pack your stuff up  they got the boxes with their name plates and if you're there that long you probably have a lot of  crap in your office to clear out yeah well you just gotta realize you gotta look after you gotta look  after yourself no matter if it's radio or whatever business you're in because brother weese i was  talking to him last night he's like hey brah you just gotta worry about yourself i'm like dude i learned 
[00:46:30]  that lesson years ago maybe you guys should have learned that years ago because you all everyone has the  the vision of being let go nicely from a gig maybe a huge office party and something better than a dumb  watch oh no one day you when you least expect it some some suit comes in it calls everyone into a  conference room and fires you you're just gone it happened to me when i was doing radio in buffalo  it happens all the time but yeah you know you think you're gonna get that about schmidt moment 
[00:47:00]  they give you the watch and a party and stuff party no instead they say hey you got a day to kind  of clear out yeah we're moving in another direction and it and uh you're not gonna be part of that so  i mean i understand it you know intercom took over and they they they got uh they're gonna be doing  something different i get that but it's it's just sad that a lot of these guys that were in radio for  a really long time are now looking for work what do you do now you know just let them go until january  why not until january people have christmas christmas to buy man let them build up some nice big debt from 
[00:47:30]  christmas and then have no way to pay it off well at least let them know you know what i'm saying  though i know jimmy it makes it more depressing for the holidays they lose their jobs and they're  gonna i don't know it's just annoying companies just suck man i think i gotta get on a jet blue  flight and go hang out with those guys today well yeah i gotta look at them better they're all  depressed and you show up with millions hi hi job's going good how are you i still got a gig  back down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down 
[00:48:00]  tell them cbs flew you up and xm chipped in to fly you back two companies now we got two companies  oh look god i've done to be insensitive uh i'll uh i'll dress down i'll dress down you  ought to go up there and give them you ought to give them nice big cash gifts that'd be a fine  they can use that for the holidays there's a big cash gift it's just a weird 15 bucks a piece perhaps  less than that it had it happens all the time but hey let's say hi to crotch critter you're on the  opian anthony show what's up sir crotch critter the crotch critter the crotch right see that's why we 
[00:48:30]  still get to keep our jobs we got listeners like crotch critter of course we do what what's up man  hey i just want to uh tell jimmy not to worry about his little fishing trip and everything and you know  being the worst fisherman in the world uh i was actually uh my boss used to force me to go on  fishing trips all the time and i was such a bad fisherman he'd catch the fish when he wasn't  looking i'd take him out of the live well hook him onto my line and throw him back in the water and 
[00:49:00]  act like i caught him dude i would have caught more fish if i took a meat hook and put a log through it  and then and just smacked it in the water and yelled here fishy fishy i would have caught i remember  my dad and i went to maine we used to go up to maine with my mom my dad me over mont i'm sorry vermont  it was like a family thing we'd do oh and my dad took me fishing and we did actually catch some late  some lake trout yeah i had to throw them back because i didn't like the idea of cooking them  alive oh that's nice yeah i i had a i had a bad experience fishing with uh my dad uh anytime one 
[00:49:30]  of these stories pop up it's like i remember these things from my youth and it was horrible we went and  we took a little rowboat out of north port he didn't make you say hail marriage did he  yeah pop pop and uh a little rowboat out of north port and it was me and my brother and i would get  seasick and i know it was completely psychological the second i got on a boat i would start getting  oh shut up watch your man up stop crying you're not going to throw up eat a sandwich eat this 
[00:50:00]  bologna sandwich and you won't be sick but i'd always get seasick and um i laid down on the bottom  of the boat and he was using like crabs for bait these little crabs and the the container opened up  and all i remember is being nauseous waking up and you know my hair back when i was a kid was this big  afro it was just as a kid you still had the hair when you turned 40 well i did not 
[00:50:30]  you stink it i had this big afro full of crabs they crawled into my hair and and were like caught  in there and i woke up stop it knock it off they're not gonna do anything tell you  yeah i your father probably goes i laugh at crabs yeah oh he did how many did you have in your hair  i don't know probably 20. wait they were crawling all over my head they were about the size of a 
[00:51:00]  a silver dollar what you fell asleep in the boat yeah it was a little rowboat and i fell asleep with  my head like under one of those little benches that you sit on when you row yeah and and the crabs  were under there and they'd gotten all in the bottom of the boat and uh my father was just picking  him up off the bottom of the boat using him for some kind of bait i don't know how but he was  doing that they were trying to find a nest and of course he was tanked you know so what is he what  did he care and then it was like i wake up i got crabs all all running through my my hair and and i 
[00:51:30]  start crying because i'm a cool cry baby kid and and he's yelling at me knock it off there's a few  crabs come here i'll get him out he's like ripping him out of my hair and the crabs you know they got  those claws they don't want to let go you know what they do what they pinch you they paint i was  getting pinched you little little boy scalp yes i was very tater uh i went fishing recently for  brett's uh bachelor party we mentioned this on the air and and i was reminded why i don't like  fishing anymore and i grew up on long island centerport you know it was all about clamming 
[00:52:00]  and fishing and and um and skiing and all that crap a lot of water sports right you know everyone  fished if you if you grew up in my area and i forgot i i don't like pulling the freaking hooks  out of the fish after you catch them and pretty much yanking their little fish head off their bodies  that crunching noise the crunching of of yeah because you know you get the the hook with what  the four prongs or the three prongs on it there's no easy way to take that out of a fish's mouth and i 
[00:52:30]  remember oh yeah this is why i don't like fishing yeah because it's a a it's a pain in the ass b it's it's  horrific you're pulling their eyes out their jaws and then throwing them back in the water hoping for  the best for the little fishy oh we never throw them back it was always like well they're come  they were really too small to cook and you know they're just hooked in some horrific way half  their lung comes out it's like what the hell nothing was worse than their kills whatever but  nothing was worse because i remember my father going uh this one you know we go flounder fishing 
[00:53:00]  or something goes oh this one swallowed the hook yeah so he'd get the knife out and cut like his  gills off and you'd see the hook in there and he'd wrench it out and pull it out and it all starts  nice like everyone has good intentions everyone has good intentions they they they they take the  hook and they try to work it a little bit like a puzzle and you hear like you said the the crunching  like you're like oh my god and then you just want it to go away and get it over with so you're just  closing your eyes and yanking you know once the needle nose pliers come out it's all over 
[00:53:30]  and you gotta pull it out with the needle nose pliers if he swallows the hook you have to get  it out because then there's gonna be some really bad fish duties  yeah and and this reminded me that i never brought the video in of uh uh the bachelor party out on the  water out there out east on long island and we're catching fish like crazy my brother knew where to go  and my brother caught a seagull and had to like reel him into the boat and take the the hook out 
[00:54:00]  of the seagull was it flying like a kite uh no no no no no this was dead weight and we all were excited  like man my brother just caught a huge fish yeah a whopper and then it turns out when all the seagulls  uh flew away except for one we're like oh no oh no the seagull swallowed the hook and but we have video  my brother reeling this in onto the boat with a huge wingspan and my brother's like uh dirty job  dude he's like my he's a micro type yeah he wasn't even phased doesn't bother me and my other brother 
[00:54:30]  were like oh my god we went to the other side of the boat like just once again just make it go away  and there's my brother working the hook out of the seagull's mouth holding it with towels and how does  that sound is that like the same crackly noise not too good but my brother had patience because i would  have just i would have just went with the let's just make this go away type of thing and uh finally  he got the hook out and uh let the birdie uh you know the seagull fly away gracefully and he did  but we have it on video i got to get that up on youtube or up on one of our websites do you know 
[00:55:00]  what asses fish must feel like like first of all when you hook a fish's soft palate do you know like  as he's getting hauled in he's probably going all right you got me all right you got all he's thinking  is why don't we have hands i could take this out it's so easy to catch all they do is put food  down with a piece of metal in it and we're finished oh evolution just meant for fish to be eaten they  just suck that's it they are just food jimmy's so right bottom of the food chain imagine how how much 
[00:55:30]  that's got it just ow ow ow ow ow ow how embarrassing how you're getting hauled up by your mouth and then  everybody has to see you have no hands or feet you're like all right all right i'm gonna tell  you and i bet you they like fish uh with what oh whatever i'm trying to figure something out uh  i bet your fish try to swallow the whole time as you're reeling them in too like they're trying not  to swallow yeah don't swallow don't swallow don't swallow this someone's calling us nancies of course  this is the beauty of our radio show we we show you the scars nancies now this is one of those guys 
[00:56:00]  that can just reach in and pull out a bunch of gill meat go ahead chris it's time to show us that  you're more of a man you're a man go ahead chris you're a man go ahead what's going on guys hey man  you guys are a bunch of freaking nancies man all the poor little fish i'm gonna pull the gills out  what the hell you think you're eating don't you eat at mcdonald's don't you have fish fillets i  don't see fish fillets i i see the uh the final product is what i'm getting at yeah i love fish 
[00:56:30]  i love i love sushi man but i you know when i go fishing i have to work that stupid hook out of  his mouth anthony and anthony of all the people that you know into guns and he's into everything  you know about like you know being a cowboy back when i was in california yeah you know what's the  point of having all those guns and you know being the rough and you know cowboy kind of guy you know  a bunch of nancies i'm not going to eat an ethnic right and sir when i eat sushi wow it's 
[00:57:00]  certified that the fish i'm eating have been coaxed into the boat and then gently dunked on  the head with a hammer not even don't just just they they just uh took a towel and just went  just made it nice and easy his death was nice and easy cutting up the middle man you know do it  yourself what the hell jesus christ right sir get a hold of yourself if we were all sharks we'd be nurse  sharks first i'll add you to the list you're more of a man than any of us in studio congratulations  thank you very much all right and i went hunting i used to go hunting that's different for some 
[00:57:30]  reason than fishing fishing's slimy and and you got pull their you know the the like i said the gills  are coming out and they're still alive when you're pulling it out like they're flopping around when you  shoot a uh like i used to hunt rabbit and stuff like that small game and you got to gut them but they're  dead they're dead can i tell you what ended my hunting career because living in western new york  it's all about going uh deer hunting i went and when you hear a deer cry it kind of takes you out 
[00:58:00]  of the game oh that's a dove that's when poe cries  no uh they kind of do make a like a screaming noise and look i'm not one of these guys you want  to you want to shoot the crap out of animals take a machine gun out  god bless you i don't i don't give a crap i really don't but i for me i learned the hard  way wow i can't handle this crap deers they're injured and just crying away in the woods i'm like 
[00:58:30]  what now what the f do we do that's why you got to be skillful take them out one shot well that's  that's it see this this is this this is this i hate hunting and i think it's unless you're gonna eat  it but anyone that goes bear hunting is oh bear hunting yes people do eat bear meat but yeah but  they're not doing it for that they're just doing it because they're impotent little men and they  want to shoot something big go without the gun faggot show up without the gun ted nugent use a bow and 
[00:59:00]  arrow ted nugent does is different though ted nugent legitimately you he uses everything he like lives in  animal bones it's different i think he's what can't you do it as ted nugent what what are you  doing jimmy i'm too tired and i what are you doing you can't just talk about ted nugent you got to  talk about ted ted will use every piece of the animal i use thank you i use the eyes the anus and  the snout you sit down uncle ted will drive the boat just relax a little bit let me tell you about  the fish uncle ted will show you how to do some vision that little kid had to make a wish and uncle 
[00:59:30]  ted help them really did he shut your mouth we get it uncle ted you're everything and we don't  exist we stink you're gonna tell us how it is we get it make a make a wish foundation he takes  kids out and the deer's just got to be thinking geez another week and i'd still be alive little  bastard well some little kid wants to go bear hunting it was like one of his last wishes how  about this no how about that how about you pick another one how about that you'll be snoozing on a  satin pillow stupid why don't you just love something and help life let's continue without you 
[01:00:00]  let's see what's second on your list yeah good point but you know whatever i i no one  warned me that stupid deer cry and that was it for me i couldn't handle that crap i didn't know  animals cried no that's why you gotta take them out immediately you got a hidden vital i i i i don't  like hunters that that you just start pow pow pow take a crap load of shots at an animal that's  that's pretty sick and twisted nowhere if you're gonna eat it and stuff you know you get that good kill 
[01:00:30]  shot i uh this is a nick the hunting i hate is uh where you go to these special hunting farms and  they stock the place with animals yeah that's i can't that's a little silly and then you get these  rich ceos that go out there and they make it so easy for you to kill the animal there's no there's no  real hunt to the whole thing it's that you drive up in a freaking jeep or something like all right  there's your kill oh great thanks he's tied to something he's tied to something just in case 
[01:01:00]  right if i if i hunt i would shoot the animal in the thigh and let it bleed out and then yell out  the whole time why don't you hide better stupid didn't you hear me coming i crinkled on the leaves  what'd you look up what you think i was there's an orange hat in the middle of the woods didn't that  bother you what'd you think the sun had shown up and was shining on your dumb deer face that's what  they think there was an orange bobbing thing with a head under it how did you not see me coming that  for years has been killing everything you know every time you see an orange bobbing thing you lose 
[01:01:30]  another friend it's like the gang drive-by sign of the woods you dope animals are idiots uh hey uh  i didn't make jimmy shill for his money you ass i just love his ted nugent impression it's hilarious  doesn't one of my favorite things jimmy does because we all lived through a bunch of ted  nugent appearances and i like the guy we all like him but when he tells us uh that we don't we don't  know crap don't understand and to just sit back and relax because uncle ted's gonna take care 
[01:02:00]  he's gonna yeah he's gonna tell us the way of the world and you know i'm like ted i'm not as  conservative as you but i'm not exactly a liberal no jesus dude all right silly goose let's uh let's  say hi to steve in stony brook uh steve what's up hey good morning guys you should listen to  yourselves do your husband's fish all right all the all the fishermen are coming out all right billy  joel from stony brook he's out there fishing your husband's he'll get it remember that guy you 
[01:02:30]  remember that guy from the underdog uh uh the underdog cartoon his name was colonel mcbrage that's the  guy command commander mcbrage that's the guy yeah have a great day fellas we were talking about him  yesterday with colin okay commander mcbrage he was a short little cartoon character who was an  adventurer he'd go all over the world and and uh he'd tell these uh bs stories about um how he would  get in trouble hunting and get out of trouble with nothing more than a toothpick and uh like a shoe  he was a liar he was a liar even as a kid i knew this guy's a liar yeah it was a cartoon about a 
[01:03:00]  compulsive liar right we all played as a kid there i was facing 20 elephants and i had nothing but a  shoelace and some chewing gum and then he'd have some guy that would sit there and and listen to  these stories and he'd be rolling his eyes he'd be like well mcbrage whatever did you do well i  fashioned a slingshot with my and he took out the elephants yeah and then uh the guy would be like  well that's quite a hair-raising experience and he'd end by going quite quite and that was how the 
[01:03:30]  cartoon ended it was dumb let's say hi to johnny the trucker it was old johnny what's up what's going  on guys i think after this story you'll probably have to call me gene uh i went on a private fishing  boat with a couple of friends and not a big fisherman finally caught my first uh striped bass pulled it  out of the water who was a keeper 36 inches you know uh was about to throw it back and the first mate  comes over with a bat and bashes the thing in the head and it explodes its head oh i don't know i 
[01:04:00]  exploded it all over the place and i was sitting there and i actually screamed like a girl i was  like how see i mean i didn't i didn't know how to kill the thing i was gonna put it in the water  oh man horrible johnny let's see this guy drives a truck for eleven johnny i respect you today because  this bit could be very easy to do where we all just sit around and talk like men we're all men  men but yes there are guys out there that are men that can't handle the first mate taking a bat 
[01:04:30]  to your striped bass that you just freaking caught yes nowhere there are people out there that actually  great actually can't handle that crap you know me and my father hold on but me and my father would  have caught more fish if we lowered little fish shotguns into the water and waited for them to kill  themselves my father stunk especially there is this brutality that the people if you go on a charter  boat it's not that it's brutality to them it's they're just it's just their way of life but you 
[01:05:00]  see it as brutality because i remember these these things called um sea robins and they are just  useless fish they're kind of a flying fish they skim along the top of the water i'm raising my hand i  gotta jump in right away when uh i was growing up my grandma had a house in waiting river right on  the beach we would catch those dumb things and you know everything i just said screw the sea robin yeah  everyone hates i would take the hook i would step on its tail to get some leverage and just yank it  out like i'm starting a lawnmower i hate sea robin well we uh we were on a charter boat and sea robins are 
[01:05:30]  useless all they do is steal the bait and uh take time away from the time you can look at the pictures of  them look at those ugly fish there's not they skim along the top of the water and when you hook one  of these and pull it into the boat the guy on the charter boat would take like a little bat and  pulverize its head yeah just so the hook would fall out of of the gooey meaty liquid that was left of 
[01:06:00]  his head why do you eat the sea robin you can't eat those there's nothing on edible there's nothing  on a sea robin you can possibly look at it they're cute they are they have little dog faces  disgusting looking they have they look like hairless red burnt chihuahuas they're a little  burn victim fish yeah no i think those are babies because i they have a different color when they're  grown a little burn they're more like a brownish gray i believe they have no lips i'm a sea robin  yeah no lips big white eyes that's what that's what it looks like jimmy when they're look at that ugly 
[01:06:30]  thing looks like it has little wings it does and it flies like right above the water and  and then you smash its brains in when you hook them because they're useless  and i remember seeing that and uh just the deck covered with sea robin blood yeah we gotta take  a break but we gotta say hi to amy amy what's up hey hey how are you hey can i say hi to jimmy  yes baby hi you just did hi jimmy are you getting tickets for his new year's eve show north fork 
[01:07:00]  theater out there uh on long island tickets until nine nine a.m a ticket master amy nice i'd love to  see you live okay well then come you got anything for a nationally syndicated radio show amy you're  killing us um yeah can i have a question yeah whatever happened to the retarded laverne and  charlie uh i don't know man they kind of that's a long i don't we really don't know there's no real 
[01:07:30]  long story there they just kind of they're the sea robins of people everybody bashed their brains  in with a bat and the police wouldn't even file a report yeah they were just skimming fun off the  surface of the earth let's kill them yeah i think we finally just couldn't take them anymore yeah  they ran their course maybe we'll get an update on them in the near future some people on the show  just run their course yeah other ones like uh patty or francine been on the involved with the show  for years and then other people just go away basically what you're trying to say is they they don't get 
[01:08:00]  the hint we've been trying to get rid of them for years but uh then i think we're finally done with  them unless your lady die becomes homeless again and starts uh uh giving treats to homeless people  for trinkets a little cash to get cigarettes and booze and a snickers bar uh feed that fat bloated  alcoholic face of hers patricia what's up hey how y'all doing guys how y'all doing how you doing  don't laugh at my accent i hate my accent the reason uh you get calls from north carolina and south 
[01:08:30]  carolina we have crappy radio down here oh yeah who's the big uh radio guy in carolina uh my husband  listens to uh bob and sherry but we don't have anybody cool like y'all we used to make fun of  bob and sherry they suck well that's all he has to listen to down here pop and sherry your your  husband's half uh yeah your husband should have on a mini skirt yeah hey i'll tell you what i have 
[01:09:00]  fish and i feed them earthworms and if i can handle it or if my husband can't stand me feeding these  fish earthworms so that's how with you she sounds like jody foster as she's going under the thing  handing her card in silence of the lambs yeah if this thing should close on you call this number  call this number hey fish oh come on now feed them earthworms yeah now we like you patricia thank you  we really i'm just as still a reason i got my xm radio so i hope y'all stay on xm i'm from butcher 
[01:09:30]  holler we're down here in wake forest country yeah wake forest country yes man  that's wake forest what what do you how do you feel about them billy dean sausage or jimmy dean  some billy dean sausage i don't know oh wow wait coke logic did an animation to the sausage 
[01:10:00]  i haven't seen that yet this is randy taylor i like my sausage sausage hey for the faithful  listeners of the show that enjoy the coke logic animations they're up on onaradio.com there's a  brand new one called sausage coke logic does very good they're really funny at this point when jimmy  goes into some of these rants all we can picture is coke logic doing an animation  everyone's laughing at my billy dean i actually think and i think billy dean's was this local 
[01:10:30]  long island uh male dance thing that was supposed to be like the uh the chippendales  ew i think i'm not sure oh boy but and they have their own sausage is that it  that's what we were referencing great wow there you go look i could have shut up i threw myself  under the bus look here for billy dean's male strippers blackmail reviews and unforgettable why  would you rock i gotta fire you i at this point i gotta fire you erox stop no i got to fire you you 
[01:11:00]  you know the spontaneous applause that are breaking out is really distracting what happened  why would you flip the website in the middle of me talking about ah forget it about the grown men's  sausage what is wrong with you really actually i wasn't that far off sausage  i'm in the middle of reading what billy dean's has to offer and he clicks onto another website  forget it erox did you click on another website all right we can't hear you did you do that what 
[01:11:30]  happened he said click here so i thought that's what he meant and i clicked on the black stripper thing  i was still reading it  so i hit the button it's set up i'm sorry boss  but it really is set up where i can't like do my own surfing so i i depend on erox so he's gotta like  he's got to be in tune with me he's got to be paying attention and uh it's too inside 
[01:12:00]  eric eric eric feels very sad right now eff it do whatever you want because people hate when i  bitch anyway so keep doing the job you're doing it's terrific you went uh john john in new york what's  up i'm in a i'm in a rock and a hard place because it's frustrating and then if i bitch too much then  the listeners get on my case but that sad face well he should be sad all he has to do is listen  the guy has so much potential but he's he just doesn't listen doesn't sleep and he's stupid he's 
[01:12:30]  reached his potential this is as far as he can go this is it i love you eric you must realize his  limitations are that of probably a young retarded boy you're a sweet but simple boy he looks sad though  you heard his feeling poor you it's frustrating what am i supposed to look at that face though look at  look at that babyish face you heard his feelings no baby face let me see you've got the cutest  little baby face he's not he doesn't look happy i see his eyes peering over the monitor i know what's  wrong with his tears in them because hero number two is is mad it looks like ziggy what's wrong on his 
[01:13:00]  face he just looks very sad let me see eric it looks like you're gonna cry he just looks very his cheeks  you're like kind of swollen up with a little bit of sadness yeah the fact that he blundered it's  all right don't worry when we go to commercial you won't catch any crap not at all hey put the pal  talk camera on me no that's not fair because i'm not gonna say a word really i'm not gonna say i'm  not gonna say i'd lambast him ah it's just frustrating we're in the middle of like that could have been 
[01:13:30]  funny uh you were was pretty funny you were referring to a a a mail strip joint mail strip uh  a troop that features mail strippers blackmail reviews and other things that uh billy dean's  sausages i meant jimmy dean but i sure fell into that one face first for the guy  and you backed into another one and your hands fell on other ones and then you grabbed two more 
[01:14:00]  with your toes like a monkey you would take all a six holer  your little feet going well that come here i tell you he doesn't let go some coordination  like a koala bear with his feet all right listen we got a guy that killed a bear wants to talk about  with jimmy okay because you you don't like guys that kill bears for the most part or you'll explain  after the bear is menacing them right all right unless it's tattooed and homosexual yes exactly 
[01:14:30]  put his bear chin right in their backs so the guy that killed the bear he's got to stay on hold  also we got the tony la russa audio we're trying to get to today we got uh we got guy richie is uh  jason coming into uh we're waiting to see guy richie's eight o'clock and uh yeah the new movie's revolver  that we saw yes we're starting to think it might be a movie you need to see more than once and  hopefully even he has said that hopefully uh jason statham he's trying to get in here in time he he  took a red eye uh he's the star of the movie and we've had him in before he's really we like him a 
[01:15:00]  lot and uh chuck dice from the radio chick who's a buddy is coming at 8 30 so we gotta and from best  week ever oh my god he's a star on best week ever on vh1 is charade still on that absolutely  charade's a big hit on the charade with his with his his just giant genitals really wow that damn  charade is a legend didn't know that yeah we could talk about his uh junk after the break how's that  about when i see him all right uh ready iraq hold on iraq click off real quick sorry i like eric he's so 
[01:15:30]  sad it's frustrating though man eric do you at least want to apologize to opie for no i don't  no no that's why oh no that's all right poor eric trust me he's probably pitting out right now  oh sweating like a oof iraq works really hard but i think of something that sweats but he's not like  an incompetent in front of a computer but he needs he just needs to listen and he needs to like just  get a better night's sleep that's all it would take why don't you hit the the thing there iraq opie and 
[01:16:00]  anthony  opie and anthony with little jimmy norton it's the opie and anthony show phone number eight seven seven  two one two oh and a we just checked out the sausage animation that coke logic did it's up on  o and a radio.com sausage very very funny coke logic very very funny that one uh k-rock here in 
[01:16:30]  new york should allow it to go viral because everyone's been checking out that uh complaint  call the jimmy dean complaint call they should let this go viral i think break.com or youtube would  throw this right up on their front page we're just talking about that it's just open-minded about it  it's just that it's a weird thing with online like you want to kind of get people to the site but you  also don't want to give away what you have on your site and then have the one come to your site so  but i don't know what to do every once in a while you gotta let one gotta let one loose man you know 
[01:17:00]  yeah put that one out there the viral thing is way bigger than one lousy website here in new york  well i think that it's like it's really weird because i only know the way i do things online but  if i see something i like as long as you know i mean as much as we keep stupid steve for watermarking  as long as people know where to go get more of it i'll go to the site usually and check out i'm  i'm relating well this one is well done it has opie and anthony the the name of the show it has uh  obviously the station we're on here in new york it's perfect it's a good little commercial 
[01:17:30]  and so you should get it to other websites that wouldn't be going to the uh sausage to the onaradio.com  website yeah this is how you turn on new people to a radio show yep by getting your stuff elsewhere  that have no idea about you and this one is great he does a great animation of the show  this dumb coke logic is really talented like they look like twisted cartoon versions of us  right so you can't you could absolutely tell who's who i'd like a sturdier jawline though  really i want to look handsomer you're handsome in real life homely in real life i want to look 
[01:18:00]  handsome in cartoons i don't want muscular i don't want those dark circles around my eyes  no that's how all his characters are i know that's his thing i want to be  thing it's a john uh john's been holding for a long time john in new york i'm sorry let's get to  you that's all right boys what's going on hey um yeah i went bear hunting in may and uh i felt like  a real man about it until jimmy just really made me feel like nothing why well uh you were talking 
[01:18:30]  about the deer crying yeah shoot a bear it lets out like a real a horrible cry like i really really felt  bad for worse over than than i do when i shoot a deer yeah there's something about when you kill  something especially bigger game that just kind of makes you feel like you've killed something  like there's a feeling you get as a human when you've killed something it's like this odd little  depressing darkness that comes over you i don't really like it i'm guessing because it's not necessary 
[01:19:00]  like to me if you kill something in self-defense it probably feels great like if a bear is attacking you  and you're on your way home from the south oh yeah yeah and you take that bat and you crack it  stupid narrow too narrow for its body's snout bears have little dumb heads and they really are  shootable like as much as i do like bears their heads are this big and i'm just opening my hand a  bit yeah they have little brontosaurus heads yeah big tough guy huge body little head i think god had 
[01:19:30]  a bunch of noses just laying around and said i just put these noses on on this thing that we don't  have a name for yet oh here comes one now it's a big old bear huh john they're kind of stupid because  i i was hunting over bait so they put the food in barrels and they just come on in and oh and then  you have to like shoot them all right john you guys rock all right how about this one and then 
[01:20:00]  we'll move on to the tony la russa thing uh dave in michigan what's up hey love you guys love the  show thank you sir thank you um i know a guy that was all joe hunter and went wild boar hunting come  back with his pig head thinking he was you know all that come to find out he got all trashed and  like before they're supposed to go out hunting didn't want to get up and go so he had him just 
[01:20:30]  bring the boar over in a cage and he shot it in the cage and went back to bed that's pretty convenient  give him points for being smart take away points because he's garbage and give him points for being  smart all right let's say hi to it's like well what else are you  gonna do with that i don't know the guy just decided that was all he needed to say joe in  syracuse what's up yeah i think one number one that's the redneck fast food way i mean you bring  the foodie in the cage and you shoot it but that guy's uh uh a lame duck for not wanting to shoot 
[01:21:00]  bear come on we're rednecks up here we shoot things and we like to hear them cry when we shoot them  really yes that's why we shoot them this guy's in syracuse yes they like their hunting up in the  syracuse area yeah absolutely yeah whatever we can shoot them with bow and arrow gun whatever i  mean i'll jump out of a tree with a knife if i gotta they think that if you graduated high school you're  a queer you don't really see the uh the deer tied to the fender anymore that kind of just drive 
[01:21:30]  around western new york man yeah you still see that i mean around here you used to see it along  i'm not not manhattan that's a little difficult up near that roscoe diner you take a little ride  up that way you'll see a ton of cars really coming at you on the other uh side of the road with deer  on their uh hoods and and uh and whatnot hey tony larusso we got to get this in before guy richie  comes in uh to promote revolver his new movie starring uh jason statham ray leota and i think

[01:22:30]  and we'll pop the link up on ona radio.com later today cops go to larusso's car while he's asleep at a  red light oh that's the worst what that's happened to you that no no i know people though that it has  happened to uh they fall asleep at the red light and a cop pulls up next to him and just goes hey  how you doing and lights green it's gone through five cycles just clicking through yeah and you're  just sitting there snoozing green yellow red green yellow red green yellow red green yellow red it's 
[01:23:00]  not good it doesn't it doesn't bode well for you when a cop pulls up and wakes you up no well here's the  audio or maybe not no i don't know that's got to be there i really don't like it's there somewhere i  really don't like these cd players maybe we can look into new ones some new ones how you doing  good you all right yeah we found you asleep at the wheel no problem yeah well yeah you're in the  middle of the intersection you realize that you're the red light

[01:24:00]  a police brutality they take pieces of video and show the cop like beating the crap out of someone  or shooting someone or tasering them and uh then you'll see the full clip and realize he was completely  justified in what he did it's a lot of a lot of you know depends on how you see it yeah because  the new how much of it you see the news will take 10 seconds 15 seconds of a clip and you're looking  like why would the cop do that yeah and then you realize the guy was pointing a gun at him  yeah and that part's not uh part of what the news just showed you all right uh larissa tries to

[01:28:30]  i'll be seeing y'all again soon real soon not in october i'll be golfing dope next year i hope to go five and  six  very dramatic you should see what's going on in the yankee dugout uh joe tory has  cancer uh uh tony la russa is saying x twice and blacking out and throwing up 
[01:29:00]  we got dennis leary coming in next week you gotta get his take on joe tory uh not continuing with  the yankees it's i try to do it justice after i saw it i don't think i really yeah  his rant on the yankees and the red sox and the dodgers and jeter and clements is is really  really funny man yeah he basically said that joe tory got ass cancer for this team and they let him  go i still say that they were they were right to let him go but we'll discuss that with young  dennis when he comes in it's more agree to disagree it was it was what i would do it was funny we'll 
[01:29:30]  definitely have to get his take on that next week all right uh i think we should take a break  now because guy richie's gonna be here any second okay let's do that it's opie and anthony  gotta get right into this it's opie and anthony in studio guy richie and he just shook all our  hands and like like you smell good man i don't know if i'm supposed to be saying that but we  really are like three fairies you walk in we're all like you smell terrific guy and i'm like what  is that he goes polo like i'm an idiot he's right is it just polo uh i gotta go back to polo i think 
[01:30:00]  really good i used to wear that when i was in uh in ice blatter sweater i always thought girls like  it it's good i'm trying out all these fancy stupid colognes and all it's polo that's old  school it's old school i tried the new polo the new polo wasn't doing it for me and uh so i went  back to the old green bottle yeah oh okay now is this some kind of trick like you just squirt your  hands and then we're all distracted like wow guy richie smells good uh you're embarrassing me now  love of god i said i was so stupid i just sort of british people smell good when they came in 
[01:30:30]  oh you threw a blanket statement out that was just ridiculous jim your coffee on me you would  have been right no i know where you're going with this ozzy smelled good when he came in and there  was another british gentleman that came in he smelled good yeah but you're talking about people that are  successful and have you know done things and probably can afford a way of life yeah i can afford  after i'm sure if two soccer hooligans walked in they wouldn't yeah they're not going to smell that  good that's right soccer hooligans guy richie i gotta start by saying uh snatch is one of my favorite 
[01:31:00]  movies of all time i know you're not here promoting that but i just got to get it out of the way man  thank you very much me i got some friends and we just quote lines from that movie it's it's just an  amazing movie i i don't even know if uh everyone has really seen that movie and appreciate it for  what it is well good well go out and buy it because i've still got vast shares in the film itself do you  really yeah yeah because i i think it's one of those movies that that uh should really just be  out there yeah it is a good one it kind of has cult status too now you know it's one of those movies 
[01:31:30]  that kind of gotten that cult uh little cult spot in history and i thought it was hilarious on the dvd  where he could put the subtitles on for just brad pitt's part i thought that was brilliant and it  just made the movie that much better because he's like oh now i understand what the guy the guy's  saying in the movie well i should probably watch that and then i could understand yeah  was that done because people said like we had a hard time understanding what brad was saying  was that like kind of as an afterthought or was that something that you guys planned on doing like  what the like it's kind of hard to understand some of this dialogue uh well when we were making the 
[01:32:00]  movie itself we kept sending back the rushes back to or the dailies and then they call them out here  back to sony and sony kept kicking up a fuss that we're using this 20 million dollar actor and no one  could understand that word that he was saying um so i mean that that was the gag and people like the  fact that they couldn't understand what he was saying yeah so uh i didn't actually know there  were subtitles on uh on his dialogue that's an american thing you know yeah yeah american people 
[01:32:30]  don't speak english not the proper english are there american movies that in england people watch and go  like what's he saying no is no answer to that no it's a funny thing i just finished another movie  called rock and roller which we showed out in uh long beach and uh one of the big deals was the accent  and uh it wasn't you know none of the accents were like extremely british in any way but it was  still like a big deal and uh i think it's just because we've been weaned on american accents forever  that uh you know it doesn't touch the sides with us a lot i don't have a problem with the english 
[01:33:00]  accents in movies like i could pick right up on it it's not like i'm sitting there going what no  it flummoxes me that anyone should get uh flummoxed by it because you know it's not that exotic is it  and i think english uh actors can put on american accents easier than americans can put on english  accents they can't americans don't seem to be able to really hold it for any prolonged period of time  they've got better they've gotten better yeah yeah i started really with gwyneth paltrow and she did  like emma or something like that and uh most of england thought she was english for a long time her 
[01:33:30]  accent was pretty spotless and then i think that sort of put a benchmark up for uh other people to  follow i watched vanity fair the other actually on the plane coming over yesterday and i think it's  reese witherspoon uh i'm not going to tell you that was a pretty spot pretty good job yeah yeah  there are certain actors that are really good at it and then you like you just see him in a movie  and assume they're english and and uh you hear their uh they they do an interview or you assume  they're american and you hear an interview and go what why is he talking like that gary oldman i had 
[01:34:00]  no idea it was not american really i heard him speak i'm like you see an interview christian bale  christian bale's another one christian bale i'll tell you what i like christian bale christian bale's great  right yeah now who was great too was kevin costner and robin hood his accent was just  shut up or how about michelle pfeiffer god lovers you can't even do southern for an entire film  right dangerous wine it's like where are you from boston or south carolina i love i love the actors  or actresses they just give up halfway to the movie they just can't keep it going yeah you're right 
[01:34:30]  jimmy yeah that's where oldman blew me away i heard him speaking i'm like he is british damn it  it's not one of ours no you're right i mean there are people that are very good at it and those  that are good at it it's a it's an impressive uh yeah but you think if you're an actor that's what  you would be good at wouldn't you and i'm quite surprised by some people that aren't good at it  yeah some people are just really bad at it oh yeah they're ranked they can't do it uh jason uh statham  he's in uh revolver yeah he's actually not the best example of an accent 
[01:35:00]  he but he's fantastic man like anything i've seen him in uh has been really good this uh movie  revolver is sort of a it's it's a bit of a departure for him because he's been the rough and  tumble gun toting uh tough guy and he doesn't really uh play that in this movie no we uh we we kept  his shirt on yeah well there is a shower scene very hot by the way wow you know what i forgot 
[01:35:30]  about this yeah but you got jason statham you're not gonna not take his shirt off for at least one  scene but thank god he gave us a naked ray leota so i'm extremely happy about that we just filmed them  like uh like martin sheen in apocalypse now having a breakdown they just filmed ray leota naked like  all right we'll use it one of my favorite scenes in revolver ray leota is making a this point to his  underlings and and all of a sudden like you pan out or whatever and he's completely naked turning  around you see ray leota ass i'm like oh my god is he insane in person ray leota yeah that you want 
[01:36:00]  the truth or yeah i'm starting to think he's not really that good of an actor he's just insane and  you just get to capture this on film well i think he's interesting i think uh i really i mean that in a  positive way i think ray has something to offer and i think uh his best roles is something that he's  allowed to be a character or even a caricature and then he can get really stuck in so uh i've got 
[01:36:30]  good things to say about ray in that respect oh you gotta i love his acting you got a great moment  out of him like he's he's like in goodfellas he was great he did a movie with madeline still where  he plays a creep and he's always in these these weird roles but you got like a real i haven't seen  like a really intense emotional moment at all i'm sure he's done them but i haven't seen it and and  there was a scene where he kind of has a breakdown of sorts in this and i was like i've never seen ray  like really weak yeah that was really like uh great scene you got out of him looks like i've  never seen him do that in the film well thanks very much i think ray will appreciate you saying 
[01:37:00]  that also um but you know ray's one of those guys that can turn on the tears within 10 seconds and  that's like the kind of talent yeah talent and it's very impressive when people can do it when actors  can just like turn on the taps and he's one of those guys and he got very emotional in that scene in  his underpants and everything snot spit everything was flying out of him oh yeah he got he got stuck  in there in fact the version that you see is i think he's like whispering when him you know yeah  but that's because the take before we tried the screaming version and he lost his voice 
[01:37:30]  so uh we went with the uh we went with the hushed tone now guy we were discussing the movie earlier on  our show and uh the movie intrigues us i don't know what to think of this movie yet i'm gonna be  completely honest with you no i think that's a fair remark and you know to a degree i'm not sure  if people should come out with a sort of i liked it or didn't like it uh philosophy after they've seen  them yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't say uh whether i i liked it or didn't like it i i enjoyed watching 
[01:38:00]  the movie a lot especially uh when it started i was like okay this is great as it went through i  enjoyed the ride completely but then i was like don't do it don't do it no not the  credits wait a minute now i gotta think i gotta watch this again i think he didn't wrap this up  in a little package for me well by the way it is wrapped up in a package it's just you can't i  gotta see it yeah i gotta watch it again i gotta watch it again it's one of those there are a few 
[01:38:30]  movies very few movies where i will get online and start trying to get other people's comments  and opinions on a movie and it it'll haunt me for days i'll just have the movie and and i'll be  thinking about it and that this is one of those movies well where i'm trying to analyze what  exactly happened who these people are um you know what their uh uh what their intent is you know and  it's it's very interesting the movie i i and and shot beautifully i love uh what you what you did with 
[01:39:00]  it but it left me going i i need to know more about this well that's a good thing i mean it's not  a movie for everyone right because it's not a straightforward entertaining movie um so it's  got to be it's it's a movie for those that like to think yes it's a it's like a thinking man's  action movie so to speak right so if you're just going for uh just the the thrill and the action  you're going to be sourly disappointed um so i want to be very clear about anyone that's going in  there they they they should know what they're getting themselves into it's funny especially with 
[01:39:30]  jason because jason's usually yes you know yeah he's driving fast he's killing a lot of people  yeah it's funny you should say that because i sat down and watched the movie and about uh 15 minutes  in i said to myself oh no i think i was supposed to pay a lot more attention than i did  i swear to god that's what i said to myself and i started the movie over again i'm like okay wait a  minute this is a little deeper than like a gangster you know movie here there's yeah there's more going  on here well it's a good idea you're right but i mean it's to a degree we we had a bunch of 
[01:40:00]  psychiatrists on at the beginning well we used to have them on the beginning okay but then people  thought they were getting into a documentary so we knocked them out but really what we were trying  to say is that you you want to pay attention from the off right right if you pay attention from the  off because it's it's a trip to a degree so if you can get your noggin into it initially then it  doesn't half make it uh more accessible toward the end i think what helps is the uh quotes in the  the beginning that kind of helps grab you and and make sure you're you're paying attention when 
[01:40:30]  the movie starts is to read some of those quotes about uh war and and game playing and chess have  we even explained the movie yet since uh guy came in your guy what's the movie about just to bring  more people okay well the movie is essentially about that uh the greatest enemy that ever existed  is hiding with your own hiding within your own head um you know as the expression goes your  your own your own worst enemy you are your own worst enemy and it's an exploration into that 
[01:41:00]  so it's what the psychiatrists call the ego it's what religionists call satan it's um it's trying to  kind of fuse all those different concepts together and uh what we're left with is uh what they you know  what the psychiatrists now call the conceptualized self um freud used to call it the i mean i don't  want to sound too pretentious about this whole thing it's uh it's what we we know is um i suppose  it's it's the aspect of our nature that's a pain in the ass and keeps us dogged right um it's it's 
[01:41:30]  the thing that makes our day miserable tremendous amount of chess in this movie too which i liked  because you don't i'm a chess freak so it's kind of nice to see like every other scene had like some  sort of a chess theme to it which made me and it was being used as you know a vehicle to have the  communication between the two characters yeah it was just background and and the way that was shot  i really liked that the low angle on the chessboard looking at the characters through the chess pieces  was really really well done they're both in focus which yeah that see that's what it got me yeah 
[01:42:00]  tough to do and we had we created a lens just for that so you could have a vast chess piece right up  front and still keep the actor in focus and the amount of light that we had to throw at that  in sort of filmic terms uh you know we had about 420ks which is like an insane amount of light  in order to uh pull that little trick off yeah i i was wondering if that was done uh in layers or  something but it was done very well yeah well the whole idea is that you are playing chess with yourself 
[01:42:30]  right so hence chess is such a kind of good metaphor such an efficient metaphor well they said bobby  fisher would only play with himself after a while or he would only date women that had like a certain  chess rating i mean obviously he's not the most socially attacked you know there are guys that  love chess so much that if you're not good enough they won't play it they'll just kind of play  themselves but how do you play yourself you just do he's out of his mind yeah he's out of his mind  he wanted to get feelings because he was afraid they're going to affect his brain waves  he played he played uh boris spasky had to have another seat brought in he was nuts 
[01:43:00]  surely you don't have to have a lesson in how to play with yourself  no no i think everybody learns that yeah the inside of my bedroom looks like a cave  are you a good player are you a good chess player i'm actually a crap chess player but i do play a  lot of chess yeah i heard kubrick was great too like he used to play on the set of full metal jacket  they say it was like a lot of directors it seems i guess like the whole thought process of of of what  chess does chess uh is the ultimate game in terms of board games i can't think of anything that uh as 
[01:43:30]  rewarding as a game of chess it just covers everything yeah or it's frustrating though  because nothing makes you feel dumber than somebody smashing you in eight moves i've lost in eight  moves and you just wow i got a i got a dumber thing i started playing chess online i've told  the story a couple times and i started kicking ass i used to play chess when i was growing up and  i'm kicking ass i'm really happy and there's a little chat thing right and this person goes wow you're  pretty good i'm nine how old are you true story and i i turned off the computer i felt like a  creep i'm like that's it i'm done i'm thinking i'm as dateline mbc comes in oh why don't you sit 
[01:44:00]  down and have some cookies up and i'm thinking i'm playing like you know chess people that are  have the same skill level as me it's not they did nine years nine years yeah there you go nine  year olds so that was it for me getting back into chess so has has the film i mean have you screened  it anywhere are people coming out with the same questions like all right we're not exactly sure what  we just saw as far as it's not an easy story to follow no it's not well the whole point of the  story is that fundamentally it is an easy story to follow right but your mind is making it complex 
[01:44:30]  that's really what the illustration of the movie is about is this is dramatically easy that's a good  point because you you start thinking in terms of i'm missing something so let me try to fill in the  blanks or let me try to anticipate what's going to happen and you wind up confusing yourself yeah  instead of just well that's the idea going along yeah the only person that's confusing you is you  yeah um and that's kind of the gist of the movie that's the gist of the movie it's that it's really  it's a really easy point to understand is that you are your own worst enemy just you will not accept 
[01:45:00]  that because the enemy in your head will make sure that you do not accept it by complicating confusing  the issue did madonna like it i don't actually seen it uh we're saying the office too it's one of these  movies you should not be late to we were discussing yeah you know you could like i miss five minutes  of a movie you haven't missed anything this movie man jason statham sets up the whole thing with a  little monologue whatever and yeah that's when i had to go back and wait a minute i think i was 
[01:45:30]  supposed to pay attention to that but that is why we put the quotes in right yeah the strings and put  the quotes in because they were supposed to be the signpost for right really pay attention now  did you have a jason cast uh like right away did you want him or did you have other people it was like  the idea of uh who's people had in mind for a role but by the way if i had anyone else i wouldn't  tell you anyway you can't do that but what do i know jirard depardue was supposed to do 
[01:46:00]  so no jason jason and i have been talking about this concept for a long time and uh so he gets the  concept and very few people do get the concept as i say because the mind doesn't want to get the concept  so he was a chap that got it and jason and i are old mates and sparring partners on the uh on the  chessboard um so it was it was a natural fit and uh i i like jason as an actor more than i do as an  as an action uh hero so to speak yeah yeah do you uh throughout the history of your work uh how do you 
[01:46:30]  feel about uh critics that have uh given you know you work hard on a movie obviously you put a lot into  it and uh critics that uh bash you for uh for a movie what what do you does that annoy you  it's got to on a personal level i'm gonna be alive i said it doesn't um it doesn't  because i know something as simple as you know you get a dumb caller or a stupid message board post  and you're like that doesn't bother me and then you find yourself you son of a you know you're just 
[01:47:00]  typing away and you're trying to defend your position yeah yeah and you just really can't  no it's futile yeah and uh i've taken a fair amount of a uh a kick in on this one because it  was what is this movie all about and i don't understand it therefore you must be an idiot  and uh and there was a kind of zeitgeist in he is an idiot and uh and then so i did take some  something of a lambasting over the idiot factor um i was thinking that last night when i was watching 
[01:47:30]  i'm like you know he's making me feel stupid and and i don't want to feel stupid so i'm gonna have  to watch it uh again yeah your movie challenged all of us i think we've seen movies we're like  oh that's crap but this wasn't crap but it's that's why i i really liked it right i enjoyed watching the  movie i just had uh a problem figuring out exactly what was going on and i don't i don't know if you can  figure out exactly what's going on it was kind of a little abstract it's true i mean it is a little 
[01:48:00]  abstract but there is a definitive kind of conclusion that the only battle that you know  this chap was right was inside his own head and it's funny there was a review that came out recently  that said uh so um this movie you know it it it built up and it looked like it was going somewhere  and then what the climax was that demons theme his own demons were the climax and i thought well  shit isn't that you know yeah climax in every movie is there ultimately you know the demon is 
[01:48:30]  the climax it's your demons are the climax there is no other climax to any movie it it should be said  too some of the uh the gun scenes some i mean the violence this movie is really cool the uh it doesn't  skimp on the violence is actually really well it needs to be said though the hitman guy uh it was  fantastic i really liked that character he was very uncomfortable with his glasses and just really 
[01:49:00]  good at his job there's a lot of action can i say there's one scene that i'm not going to give away  the movie but i'm going to say there's one scene with a hand being stuck to a table via a nail and it's  really really good really good that was a great yeah great scene in the kitchen well although the  movie's kind of esoteric i wanted to make it accessible in the action kind of factor so um  because i'm not actually into esoteric movies i go to the cinema fundamentally to be entertained 
[01:49:30]  but i do like to be challenged and there's not that many movies that are challenging i suppose really  anymore there's nothing worse than when somebody will put a movie like that they want you to think about  and then take the violence out on purpose it's almost like pulp fiction did a great job of that  where they had they had violence that was violence and and there was other parts of it that were  completely uh hitting another part of your brain it was like both parts were done well so i kind of  like the fact that the violence wasn't skimped on but it wasn't overly hyped either what what movies have 
[01:50:00]  you seen that you thought were were good and and and got you thinking instead of just you know action  movie actually it's quite interesting because there was a movie i saw two days ago imax 3d um which i  hadn't heard great things about um and i didn't think i was really going to enjoy it and i thought  it was brilliant but i enjoyed it on the intellectual uh harry potter uh and it was bear wolf really  yeah okay i thought it was pretty smart really yeah i mean it's come clothed in like this kind of action 
[01:50:30]  kind of ancient epic but uh that narrative's pretty smart yeah it's pretty smart it's the same it's the  basically it's the same as revolver it's the idea that you're feeding in this have you have you  got no i haven't seen it i gotta tell you lads it's pretty smart um it's the idea that you feed this  internal beast and it turns into a dragon and in uh the metaphor in this case is the dragon and uh in  the end you've got to go to war with it um and the more you feed it the stronger it gets um so i really 
[01:51:00]  enjoyed it and i like a bit of 3d and i like a bit of action yeah was it good 3d i like a bit 3d and i like  imax i've only seen one 3d movie at imac uh 3d that was superman with the with the stuff floating  in front of you and you're trying to grab is that a new one or is that an old one it was the one that  came out what did i say i said superman right yeah you said imac huh you said imac you mean imax  imax 3d i'm sorry yeah imac you watched it on his own right this is why i said that this is how dumb i 
[01:51:30]  am and i have to throw myself under the bus when you said i saw this great movie imax i swear i thought  imax was the name of the movie that you saw you know nothing of what is going on in technology  or yeah you know the big theater yeah yeah 3d that's an experience i mean if you're into like  experiences the imax experience which is the big screen right so you're in it they got the 3d thing  figured out it's kind of creepy and they've got the 3d thing figured out like some of the stuff's right  in front of your eyes even if you're sitting way back in the uh imax theater having seen uh honey 
[01:52:00]  i shrunk the audience in uh disney uh i do know a little bit about 3d i saw friday the 13th part  three in 3d well that must have been great back then yeah it was like a spear in a head and the  rest of it was not 3d right stunk it's the old spear gun wasn't it yeah yeah yeah that's right  one other thing about revolver why did you decide to tease the audience with that really  hot girl topless i think it was in a sauna with the beer bottle yeah she had the beer bottle between  her legs yeah it was like in her between her thighs the thighs it's obvious she's completely 
[01:52:30]  nude and then she decides she needs a sip of that beer and the camera followed the bottle out of  the bottle up there guy what's up with that she was uh england's most famous lap dancing queen really  and uh was you know famous for getting her entire kit off and strangely and the reason we chose her  because we didn't think we would have any problems on the day you're removing the bottle right but uh  on the day she became more prudish and actually she's wearing it she is wearing a pair of under 
[01:53:00]  shorts really um behind that uh behind that bottle not that we were going to reveal anything anyway but  it was funny how coy she suddenly became so you had a uh shoot it a different way uh no we shot it  the same way we i think we painted our shorts in the end she had a bigger pair of uh boxer shorts on  than me but but she became really prudish but the idea was is that you know that's it's all these  different forms of seduction so we did use a couple of uh rather fit young ladies in there yeah um and 
[01:53:30]  lord john was yeah different characters represent different aspects of vice and lord john who was the  chinese chap uh did uh he his ladies uh respond uh corresponded to vice yeah you see uh you have  how familiar with john woo's films like not the american stuff but the the stuff he did with like  chai and fat uh like hard-boiled yeah like that how great are those yeah well i loved a bit hard-boiled  but also they came out from left field no one was good no one was seeing them coming and they were 
[01:54:00]  hard-boiled yeah um and they were fresh i think they sort of went somewhere else after a while but  when they first came out that was good stuff well yeah after the american once you try to do violence  like american eyes is very difficult you know he was doing just free-range shooting over there and  then nicholas cage shows up and he's a good actor but it was like yeah all right face off  you know i mean it was just senseless violence the chinese versions were fantastic guy walks in  holding the bird there's 80 people dead and you're like all right i don't care what's going on well  we have to take a break and we got to get uh guy richie out of here you're doing all the interviews 
[01:54:30]  today uh i am chaps but thanks a lot for having me on and thanks for being broad-minded well we yeah  we were trying to figure it out you know i i absolutely i'm going to watch it again uh because like i said  i really enjoyed the movie i enjoyed it but it was one of those that got me thinking and i don't know  why i i enjoy looking at a movie and thinking about it and i don't know why that annoys me so much  like i get annoyed that i have to then go and and check what other people thought but but that's like 
[01:55:00]  a healthy thing to do well any kind of why am i so annoyed by it it's like clockwork orange or any  other type of film that people see that they have to think about people like a fairly  like what and then like they watch like everybody else says oh it was really good they go oh okay  now i kind of see well now clockwork i've seen like a thousand times and i love it but the first  time i saw it i was just sitting there going what stop what what is this about an orange you know  summed it all up right there i just i've read what it's about and i still really couldn't put 
[01:55:30]  it into words that's probably my favorite movie yeah when's revolver come out next uh week  i think it's next friday i believe it must be it says here in theaters next friday december 7th okay  okie doke the movie's called revolver and this is guy richie you got to come back please thanks  we had fun with you thanks all right it's opie and anthony we'll continue in just a bit  it's opie and anthony jim norton's uh tickets going on sale very soon right 15 20 minutes from right now  yeah for new year's eve if you're not going to be in manhattan uh oh you just heard that commercial  locally yeah it's uh ticketmaster.com i'm doing new year's eve on long island it's uh the north fork

[01:58:00]  chuck show up you didn't tell your name did you hi i'm chuck nice chuck nice frank pleasant's gonna hurt  you after me no why because he sees an opportunity he saw an opportunity he's like screw this i'm  i could be scary i guess and maybe show some funny because when i when i called in i would you know  i was like yeah man i'm gonna come in yeah you know i put on the the the black sand the scary black  black sand black and then when i got here everybody was like well who are you yeah i was like no i'm  the guy pleasure i'm chuck nice exactly wow we had top of the morning we had guys that were scary on 
[01:58:30]  site they were like in prison for horrific things and it was kind of like your drop tattoos yeah we kind  of did a scared straight type of thing if you remember that old show and then chuck nice was  one of the guys and he made us laugh and then you did a few other shows you love i did like  chuck we just don't have a room man but but anyway it didn't make a difference you guys hooked me up  which you know it's cool though because honestly you know this you guys this is a hardcore show  you know i mean i'm a little soft for this show you know what i mean to be honest i mean i'm 
[01:59:00]  i'm a little soft you guys are a manly kind of like hardcore manly we were talking about how we  can't take fish hooks yeah exactly that was our bit today how we're wimps when it comes to fishing  and we can't yank the hook out of a fish's mouth see here's the deal you would actually touch a fish  see that's where i'm coming from like i would never even touch a fish they're too slimy as far  as i'm concerned i am one viewing of yentl away from being a homo seriously seriously fish are fun to 
[01:59:30]  catch right and then as they're flopping around you like you take the hook out of their mouth and  they're like oh he's throwing me back and then you step on them oh you step on their little  little fruity fish stomachs how you're going hey chuck nice is gonna be at comics here in new york  and uh i gotta help out chuck because mark maron was so mark maron uh came in and promoted and loves  the club don't get me wrong it's a great club but he was so pissed on stage because he's like oh my god  no one no one found me this weekend because they didn't know you had to spell comics with an x yeah 
[02:00:00]  so if you're like uh searching around trying to find out about this new club in new york which  they do a great job they have a nice presentation really nice and the bar right next door is really  cool too whatever gin lane but it's c-o-m-i-x and chuck nice is there this weekend it's on 14th and 9th  it's right in the meatpacking district it's really like it's a hot area there's a lot of food and stuff  and clubs around there yeah i bought down there because yeah they're kicking the trannies out of that  area yeah i was gonna say i remember when it was drug dealers and trans trannies out they're kicking it  out for the like the nice restaurants and the nice comedy clubs i know you're gonna drive eight 
[02:00:30]  blocks to the west now god almighty where can you humiliate yourself with a daddy's disappointment  there's a comedy club here god almighty how many adam's apples i've waved at right in front of this  place but they're still kind of around i forgot to tell the story i went to see bob newhart at comics uh  ron bennington did his uh uh unmasked down there oh nice and it was amazing jimmy went too and as we're  me and lindsey are going for a cab there was actually a tranny in a dress jumping on a bicycle 
[02:01:00]  to go somewhere i don't know where that's right yeah actually i was going i was going up to uh  caravines that's where there you go hey uh have you filmed uh best week ever yet yeah actually we uh  i filmed it yesterday man and uh what's all the what are you guys talking about as far as pop culture  this week i have no idea um i just did the sizzler that's it we i do this thing called the sizzler  where it's like a little it's a spoof on uh all those entertainment tonight type shows yeah where 
[02:01:30]  you know i'm actually playing a a dumb vapid uh pat o'brien so i'm like pat o'brien except i'm not  coked up or horny that's it you know and uh so i mean this the things that we do are bits so i don't  know exactly what we're talking about because i didn't actually do the show this week well anthony and  i uh a little known fact we got to do best week ever and at the time everyone thought we did a really  really really good job everyone's like laughing behind the scenes and the cameras like oh my god  and then they were ready to like get us to be regulars on that show and then the show aired and 
[02:02:00]  they used 10 seconds of us i'm like what is this yeah there's a lot there must be a lot of cutting  room floor stuff so they either were lying to us i'm not i'm not gonna sit here and you know i'll  tell you what i think it was that they were either lying to us no or our stuff might have been a little  too harsh yes or see too harsh or see uh corporate got involved because we weren't supposed to do  anything for any uh viacom properties at the time we were trying to sneak one in uh on them it's  probably the latter two yeah really i think i'll be dropping the c-bomb i don't think they were going 
[02:02:30]  to use that uh and then the thing they used was like who gives it it really was who gives a crap it  wasn't memorable whatsoever but i remember when we were taping we were cracking them up with our little uh  when that was on pop culture now you know the pain of every single panelist on that show really  because honestly that's the way it is why is that because they uh they got to run it by uh you know  the the same thing that happens here you remember how it used to be when you guys could come on the  air oh my god say basically whatever you wanted you know what i mean it's like you would say whatever 
[02:03:00]  you want we listen to some best of stuff and swear that it could never have played on regular radio  and uh that's where it came from yeah so uh and so it's the same thing it's like they have that  same kind of standards and practices type people like do they sit there and worry about who they're  going to offend right and that's the new thing it's like well uh that's how do you do the show then  man that's rough well they don't care because they're looking at like getting celebrities on vh1 it's  not about the show it's about vh1 that's their deal it's like we don't want to push them right we 
[02:03:30]  don't want to piss anybody off because we want people to be on vh1 right so that's the deal with  all those restraints though uh best week ever definitely does a good job it must be said  as tough as it might you know it must feel for you guys you guys definitely pull it off every  week well actually it's not tough because they did the same thing to us that they did to you  it's like go ahead and say whatever you want we're just not going to use it i've done a few of those  shows i've done i never did best week ever but i've done like mtv had uh one i've done probably six or  seven in the clip shows and i and they never use my stuff it's just i mean they'll use one or two 
[02:04:00]  lines but it's just brutality yeah believe me god don't have had a miscarriage and  you know i mean no matter how horrible your life has been what is his preoccupation with abortion  i don't understand  yeah but it's cool man i mean i i enjoy doing it you know i i love being a part of it so i don't  okay i mean i do five tv shows you know i mean five five work for five tv outlets wait which one 
[02:04:30]  well i work for msnbc uh that's right you're one of the talking right i work for fox women's  entertainment uh and vh1 women's women's entertainment i told you i'm soft man we  i told you i work for we what do you do for we i have a show called cinema therapy on we  cinema therapy cinema therapy all right and what does this entail okay this is this is how gay  i am at this point guys i uh i walk around the city with a big blow-up couch okay this is what 
[02:05:00]  happens don't have children don't have children because this is the kind of stuff you will have  to do to humiliate yourself to put food on the table but i walk around with a big blow-up couch and  we sit down outside at like i set up an office and women come and sit to me like i'm a therapist and  we talk about a movie like as it relates to their lives and i can't even look at you wow what  happened you're talking about chick flicks yes and how chick flicks relate to their lives can i tell 
[02:05:30]  you something you could say no to some of these projects and see i don't have that word in my  vocabulary there's no problem with saying no every once in a while what oh there's the big blow-up couch  yeah man it's very embarrassing it's very embarrassing there should be a  marital aid glued to where you're sitting  wow and then you you get women sit down hey sit on the blow-up couch with you you uh  do you show clips or the whole movie and you host the whole movie all right i'm hosting the movie so 
[02:06:00]  you pop in every so often and say so how does you know you see the woman here in the movie and she's  uh has has this relationship with this man absolutely and at first it's wonderful but  her friends know there's a problem then he turns into a homicidal maniac right how does that relate  to you exactly beside the fact that i want to kill you right now are you able to at least have fun  with it like if it's a domestic violence film are you able to go now listen i know you're watching  this have you learned that you should be told something wrong have you learned have you learned 
[02:06:30]  that the bigger the sunglasses the less explaining he has wow yeah man it's um hey look uh you know my  nuts are in a can that's all i'm saying to say planters that's all i'm saying you know well you're  uh you know you're you're working man it's tough when you're turning down gigs when you like the main  gig that you got used to is gone even if it's temporary it's very tough to say no that's a good  it's a good gig yeah why are you kidding it's okay it's a good gig it's it's a little um it's 
[02:07:00]  not with me yeah i was gonna say it wouldn't be my first choice in jobs and then fox you want to  talk to those red-eyed people i've done the show twice i've done very well i like the guy greg a  lot greg is a good guy yeah and then and i won't do the show again because they had me booked twice  they just canceled me like they moved me twice for other people who are going to be in town well  screw them oh i can't believe that i know i like greg a lot and go screw you you like football  there chuck i love it seriously it's actually my favorite sport i hate my team i'm from philadelphia

[02:16:00]  huh what is he doing oh is that crazy guy oh my god why do we have to deal with you today  all right it's okay kenny whoa whoa how come they were still alive to jump out of the buildings if  they uh the fires were hot enough in that building to melt the steel what they jumped out because it was  hot what it was hot enough to melt the steel how come they were still alive to be able to jump dude 
[02:16:30]  they jumped and then the building fell hours later or an hour or so later so it was hot enough for  them to jump and then as the fire the official story said that it was thousands of degrees yeah  yeah those people dude those people that were on the thousands of degrees floors were dead instantly  the other people that were above it as the fire kept burning they got trapped and had to jump  it's it it that makes perfect the official story said that the fires were very intense they were  that's what melted this the the steel or softened the steel enough to make the building look the way 
[02:17:00]  those buildings were built they were built like a web uh steel is a good conductor of what you need  to heat up the whole you need to heat up the whole structure before there's even any time it was really  proven by engineers that just enough heat to soften the metal was enough to make it the floors buckle  and the support system for that building was such that the floors actually supported is this why uh  steven uh steven jones a physicist found thermates when he was able to get a sample of the steel 
[02:17:30]  are you saying that the building was demolished hey there's uh i mean there's enough questions to  warrant a new investigation a new independent what questions like was it demolished do you think that  it was a controlled detonation that brought the buildings down of course so you say that for weeks  in advance people were planting explosives and while people were working in the trades there were many  witness testimonies that said yeah that they were um they were on the weekends they would shut down 
[02:18:00]  the power of the whole building yeah but do you know i mean look let me explain i know you say i know  you know what it takes do you know what it takes to wire a regular sized building for detonation it  takes months and they have to strip the building they have to drill holes in the concrete and plant  explosives wire them all the way back to a detonator how is that going to be done in a building that is  carrying on business as you might know as you remember that whole i am answering the question all right 
[02:18:30]  the building was not filled to capacity it doesn't many people that came in on monday found dust on  their computers that they had to clean up like they was that there was construction going on because  there was probably construction going on like i used to work in buildings like why was on a nightly  basis you'd go and change around air conditioning registers and dust would fall on desks it's a big  difference a little dust on the desk and taking jack hammers drilling holes in concrete and steel 
[02:19:00]  and they are winning this testimony to say thousands of pounds of explosives to bring down a building of  that size this well how come the firefighters testimony on the 9-11 commission report was not even added to  the 9-11 commission report stating that there were explosions going on there probably was there was  flammable equipment in there there was uh mechanical units john schroeder and other things on youtube 
[02:19:30]  john schroeder that went when concrete slabs are falling on top of right now saying that he covered  it up really what saying that what did juliani cover 100 of witness testimonies saying there's  explosives in the building are you guys all together i don't think that there were just give a  shit man yeah like you oh that's funny you don't know the first thing about me you defending the  popular mechanics i didn't say shit about this the popular mechanicals article i read that don't 
[02:20:00]  fuck with me trust me why are you defending that article when it was written by nephew of homeland  security i asked you a question are you guys all together or you got someone just walking by  you don't know what i think about 9-11 i just want to hear what he says about the popular mechanics  article the popular mechanics article was written by benji churdoff who's the nephew of the head of  homeland security michael churdoff uh-huh and they fired the entire staff of popular mechanics  article months before they printed that but wouldn't it make sense that you would get a guy that kind  of would be able to have access to some information like that what was that i'm sorry like that guy 
[02:20:30]  you said he's he's the nephew of uh one of the gentlemen from homeland security so wouldn't you  think that that would you think that somebody like that would have access to certain uh uh  uh records and and and information that would give him a more accurate uh uh interpretation of  what happened right all his all his credentials say that you know he wrote high school football  articles for you know the school paper you know so i would understand why they would make him the 
[02:21:00]  senior fact checker can i just ask you one easy question then what's that isn't it easier to say  that a few fanatics got on planes and destroyed our buildings instead of this vast conspiracy  involving thousands of people and and uh uh logistics that are nearly impossible yeah  so isn't it easier to say that that's why that's what's used to no it's not what's used i'm not  saying what's used it's it's just what it was it why can't it just be can you accept can you even 
[02:21:30]  accept for a second that maybe i want to even say indefinite that maybe that's all it was was some  fanatics that blew up some of our buildings based on their hatred of our way of life i did i accepted  it for a few years man but uh you know after going into it and investigating things about it it's clear  that how did you investigate they're looking at websites that are that were part of the 9 11  commission report saying there was a park bob graham came out said it was a park these people have come 
[02:22:00]  out i love park.com were the planes an illusion yeah you know what i want to believe the official  story but after reading parts of the 9 11 commission report not the i read the i read the 9 11 commission  report it made it made sense it didn't it made sense based on building seven not mentioned in the  9 11 building seven the whole building seven thing is ridiculous sir it falls in what was it seven  seconds eight seconds oh here it is the gravity thing i've read that no no it's not gravity i'm saying  when it falls in eight seconds it's not mentioned in the report like it's kind of strange like it fell 
[02:22:30]  because it was damaged by another building falling into the front of it it was on fire for a while  why not investigate that like why why investigate it's part of the whole picture it it fell down there  was two planes that hit buildings it that's what happened there wasn't this vast conspiracy  everyone that thinks this is crazy and you win  well okay i'm glad you could another guy yes sir oh okay one more yeah look you guys haven't 
[02:23:00]  obviously haven't done your research i've done wait a lot of really not obviously i have done a lot of  research uh the new pearl harbor by david gray riffer and i would challenge you david ray griffin i  would challenge you to read that and then come back on your show and say what you disagree with in that  book he lays it out piece by piece it's not it's not just it's not just websites it's not just a lot  but then you can read another book and it'll give you a different point of view i i will not accept one 
[02:23:30]  of your little flyers um have fun with have fun with that check out 9 11 i've checked believe me i've  looked at both sides very thoroughly and the the one that makes the most sense is the easiest thing  here and say what you're saying if that's true you don't being a gatekeeper you don't think that  there were fanatic muslims that hate our way of life that tried to bring down the trade center back  in 93 so why the hell why don't you think that this is possible that they succeeded and and possible 
[02:24:00]  that they beat a trillion dollar defense yes they did guys in a cave we were delusional thinking we  were safe that's what happened crazy conspiracy no it just doesn't make you feel safe knowing that with  all we have in place they got us hijackers yes from saudi arabia attacked us yes able to score  four hits in the most effective airspace in the world yes so we invaded iraq and afghanistan thank  you can i ask one question that's exactly what happened can i ask you a question an honest question 
[02:24:30]  not even to attack you but if they were going to go through all that trouble why not just go through  the parking garages and do it the way they tried to do it in 93 i mean honestly hold on dude hold on  you keep jumping up you're reacting emotionally i'm asking you if you're going to go through all  this trouble and you want to bring the buildings down why not just go through the parking garages  where you have so few people to neutralize and so hold on dude hold on think about it logically 
[02:25:00]  you're talking about uh security and faking voices or doing all this shit to to hide passengers  why not just just put explosives in the garage and knock the buildings down that way we're not  claim to know all the answers but that's why i'm not even saying you should know that but i'm saying  that's not when you're looking at the the government the same bung bungling government  that like you know if they were trying to do this to invade afghanistan or iraq jesus couldn't they have  come up with a better reason than leaving colin powell hanging with that awful uranium thing i mean look 
[02:25:30]  at how fast that story fell apart if they if they were brilliant enough to pull off 9-11 yeah they're too  incompetent to pull off 9-11 could they leave colin powell hanging with that shitty awful i mean it was an  embarrassment for the u.s government look invading iraq wasn't the only reason that that this was  probably done we could have done that by the way without 9-11 because they uh they had been uh  fucking with the sanctions for years so anytime we wanted we could have invaded iraq exactly it's  a whole strategy of destabilizing the middle east and well we didn't need to blow the buildings here 
[02:26:00]  chipping away at our civil liberties in the united states it's not just about one thing uh the towers  themselves were not profitable anymore they were they were white elephants um this is you know  but dude when governments do things like this it's it's it's a whole you know it's this basic  question you're giving them a lot more credit than they're due you're giving the united states  government officials a lot more credit than they're due for pulling something off like this my friend  a lot more the dude the basic question of why i mean it's it's a really simple question but you got 
[02:26:30]  to think about it it's like the intricacies you'd have to do to pull this off as brilliantly as they  did when they could have went the amazing have you heard of operation northwoods no i don't any any  of that stuff a lot i mean i've heard there's a million little operations they're going to shoot  a plane down over cuba i've heard all that yes and that was signed by the joint chiefs maybe it was  but that wasn't a passenger airline being filmed that was supposed to be done between the cuba and  florida it's different i'm not talking about that's a bad example yeah they bring that up they bring up 
[02:27:00]  the gulf of tonkin there's there's plenty of examples stick with this basic question of why  not go if they're going to plant things why would you plant things on the 90th floor the 78th floor  why wouldn't you just go into i mean i keep saying the same thing but it's if i'm thinking of this and  i'm not i'm not they would have thought of it why would you go through having to fake with voice  recorders people leaving messages who said they were islamic terrorists on the plane there were people  who said that to their loved ones why would you all of the things that could go wrong all of the 
[02:27:30]  people that would have to be involved when you could get x amount of people into a parking garage  and cover that up i mean you could literally do that with 20 people now you're dealing with  passengers on planes family members like it's a vast conspiracy that covers thousands of people  they wanted to create a spectacle something that was something that was huge that would be broadcast  on tv those buildings a catalyzing event a real a real time you know horror show okay something  that something that could galvanize the people you're right the terrorists absolutely wanted 
[02:28:00]  to show that a huge event that was a spectacle yeah and i just want to find out who the terrorists  are but dude hold on let me i don't want to interrupt extremists if that was true because  because the news media came on that day no oh here's your you know because we are hated by these  people we are hated by these people because of our way of life they have tried in the past so that  they have succeeded and they have succeeded in the past at at blowing up uh military installations 
[02:28:30]  military equipment and civilian equipment and terrorized uh other nations around the world we it was our  turn they had planned this we up as a nation uh who should have seen it coming and they got us  they got us there's no government conspiracy here challenge you sir to read some of these books that  are out there that i i have not the one you mentioned but i have i have done a lot of research 
[02:29:00]  coral harbor the ones that lay it out step by step because you obviously haven't done the research no i  have don't don't don't just point me so don't point me off as being ignorant because i didn't read  your the book why are you ridiculing people that are trying to do did i ridicule you we're giving  you a forum we're giving you a cute boy bro on your show you said he had mommy complex yes i said  that yes that kid was an ass mommy complex yes i did say that on you guys he's changed his opinion  and facts he's looked at pictures and changed them he's changed the pictures it said oh this 
[02:29:30]  has no plane equipment in it and then when people have shown plane equipment he changed his story  i don't i don't know what you're talking about i'm talking about the pentagon pictures with that  show equipment that came from an airplane uh where he says no plane crash and then the picture shows  the airplane equipment and maybe he changes his story there's an engines in there and stuff you  know whatever but i've asked you basic questions whatever dude i've asked you i've asked you basic  questions why do you guys ridicule ridicule i've asked you basic questions about 
[02:30:00]  we're giving you a forum basic questions about why would they do it that way and you can't answer  it subject you laugh about it you joke about it you ridicule it dude we're giving you a forum i'm  asking you very serious basic questions listen to yourself you're being the angry young man this  is what you're doing you're being the angry young man no one's yelling at you i'm asking real  questions a gatekeeper dude that's childlike rhetoric i'm asking you real questions you're not  you're not taking this seriously oh see you're not doing the research stop with the angry young 
[02:30:30]  man routine that's the rebellion against mommy that i'm talking about that's the rebellion against  mommy that i'm talking about take your damn sunglasses oh look you're right your little  beard is angry oh don't be such an angry young man angry you're losing the argument son  son you're losing the argument and you don't like it we're not yelling at you for this  what you guys got the microphones and everything so do you no one's yelling you've been able to  say whatever you've wanted we've given you probably more time than a lot of people give you look at 
[02:31:00]  the angry young man routine but i would just challenge you to do some more research you're  no more concerned than we are you're no more devastated than we are you're no more affected  than we are and you're no more informed but you're coming off like this angry young man  you weren't formed yes how do you know how informed i am exactly how do you know how i can see by your  face that when i ask you a basic question like why wouldn't they go through the garage and again i  know you don't have the answer for that but that's but i see your angry young man face and you're just  trying to prove your point from an emotional point of view instead of logically looking at it 
[02:31:30]  i'm i you think i didn't look at that stuff of course it bothered me why wouldn't the u.s  government release that extra pentagon footage because they do a lot of shady that was a  terrible move i'm not saying that there's been no questions but like what if the buildings were  hot enough to live why were they still uh why were they jumping if the buildings weren't were too hot  is is a question you can ask in theory but i can't ask you a question why wouldn't they go through the  fucking garages and you want to talk about it and i hold on you you want to talk about a spectacle  how about two buildings falling with 25 000 people in each that's a bigger spectacle okay they would 
[02:32:00]  have killed a lot more people had they gone through the garage and collapsed the buildings onto other  buildings that would have been a bigger spectacle to kind of counter what you said about  nature as to why did they go to or if they'd have set off the detonations uh when people were in  there at noon or uh or such and done it that way they could have killed a hell of a lot more people  i mean to answer your question there was an explosion in the basement before the first plane hit  this was reported by a man that was working in the building for 20 years he thought a transformer 
[02:32:30]  exploded people coming out of the basement with skin hanging off their fingertips i can only tell you  that that's the first time i've heard that i'm not saying you're lying it's in it's in loose  change whatever it is i'm telling you is a very slanted piece dude it's it's it's very slanted it's  very biased i mean look it is very biased um there's also a a film i gave you on the dvd right 
[02:33:00]  there mr norton uh terror storm it goes into the whole history of government-sponsored terrorism  see and i'm not even saying that government admit it you can find this on the cia.gov website  see what i listen to when i hear like a guy like when i hear you talking i'm listening to where you're  coming from it's like you're legitimate like you're almost saying that like uh that it's an  impossibility that terrorists would hit the u.s or that or that it could happen that way like you're  all legitimizing their rage and like their anger and saying well they have reasons to be like 
[02:33:30]  instead of just realizing that yeah maybe we are considered an enemy and they did catch us with our  pants do you think the u.s has coal was an inside job yeah or how about tanzania and kenya the  embassies i mean the thing is uh the u.s funded al-qaeda we trained al-qaeda yeah we know that yes  and we also yeah we funded bin laden of course without trying to kick the russians out of afghanistan  yes we did they were of an enemy of our enemy at the time so yeah we funded saddam we were friends  with saddam because he hated iran yes i mean we are guilty like everyone else in the world of being 
[02:34:00]  selective which sides we choose at times every country does that i'm not saying it's right  the american government here believe me they've all done that really done some awful things whenever  whenever we need to invade a a country oh here here's a here's a thing that happens  dude the russians so convenient the russians fought us in vietnam we fought the russians in afghanistan  well of course we have selective friends i'm not saying we don't no one's denying that but that doesn't  explain how they pulled off this if this was an explosion that brought down a building i might 
[02:34:30]  say but it's also been reported in mainstream media that the that uh the supposed terrorists  were trained in spy schools in america okay but they went to aviation school here because we were  stupid and didn't do background checks on on people okay so the fbi actually was on to these guys but  they didn't have the communication set up between the cia and the fbi they slipped through the cracks  we fucked up as a nation our security wasn't as good as we all hoped and thought it was going to be 
[02:35:00]  we thought that if a plane flew over the white house that missiles would shoot out of the white  house and shoot it down and then we found out much to our chagrin that just wasn't the case we  were vulnerable i mean thing is if we didn't have a foreign knowledge of uh even even having a thought  of planes hitting buildings how come when bush was in the g8 summit in canada oh no forgive me geneva  they had surface to air missiles and they shut down the airports they've been they've been putting 
[02:35:30]  patriot missiles a year before 9 11 everywhere everywhere where there are a lot of government  officials like uh at those uh uh meetings yeah yeah they they they put patriots around to protect  the fucking people from but they shut down the airport that's never been done and planes being  hitting into into buildings it's never but it's not a new concept i think when the trade center was  built they built it to withstand a 707 right of course that's always been a much bigger as a uh 760 yeah 
[02:36:00]  yeah look it's not much bigger i mean even oh oh goodness i've got the engine i'm looking at him  like why why are you looking like we're having a like i just look at you like you like you want to  come off with this angry thing but we're coming at you logically no one is screaming at you or shouting  you down so i'm curious as to why you're coming from where you're coming from  we're giving you a pretty fair forum i think in discussing this with you  well i'm not to not to be disrespectful but i'm asking i'm sure okay well i'm frustrated because 
[02:36:30]  you guys um you guys haven't done research you you're parroting you're parroting the mainstream media  in the in the official story and you know i'm just trying to trying to figure out how to how to  how to get in and and uh and make some sense to you guys because it didn't bother you when i asked  you about that that why didn't they go to the garage we're not parodying anything dude you're  not the only one that has watched the news or that has read things online or that has investigated you're 
[02:37:00]  not the only one that cares about this you're not the only one that's what do you think like you're  this brilliant guy who sees it and we're all these sheep it's silly that's pompous and it's not  realistic it's not realistic to think that you're this enlightened genius and we're all just dummies  who bought what uncle sam pulled us sometimes we care as much about it as you do the simplest  explanation is just what happens sometimes sometimes but why are you assuming what this is what happened  because the alternative no because the alternative the one you're giving me the alternative that you're 
[02:37:30]  giving me is so fantastic and so impossible to pull off that it's not to be considered no i've done  the research when you look at history what happened to the people on the planes like they were calling  their families what it makes a lot more sense what is that people calling their families saying that  there was a terrorist had taken over the plane with i mean like how do you explain that i mean that's  a very basic question i'm asking which is something the government could have avoided completely  by just going through the garage but when people are calling their families and they're saying we're 
[02:38:00]  on this plane involved it's been taken over what how do you explain that wasn't there a 0.008 chance  of a success rate of a call at that altitude didn't they do the research on that you can't make calls  at that altitude they were coming down they were at 30 000 feet they were very low my friend 30 000 feet  they were 15 minutes very low and when they were when they were coming down especially for the second  flight they weren't they weren't 30 000 feet in the air when that happens to the buildings you're 
[02:38:30]  acting like they were flying over mount everest they weren't you can't make a statistic that you're  asking okay that's a that's a clever thing that you just want to talk about parroting something  why are you not calling her out for parroting 0.008 chance of a statistic when i'm asking a very  basic question which is what do you people i've seen family members interview that said my husband  called or my son called what is your explanation that these people who had their son or their  husband or their wife calling from the plane you're throwing out a statistic what is your  explanation for or recorded message on on a home telephone you don't think there's any chance 
[02:39:00]  whatsoever that those might have been faked any chance whatsoever faked phone calls from family  you're talking x files now though we're talking about i mean i'm trying to look at you that's a  little intricate you wonder why people don't take you seriously the phone calls were all fake so instead  of going through the garages and with a few video cameras the government faked phone calls and yet  they couldn't make colin powell look good uh but making that shit ah we saw a trailer with uranium in 
[02:39:30]  it and it wasn't and the whole theory fell apart and the u.s government had to change why they were  in iraq and looked like assholes so they couldn't figure that out and yet but they could fake phone  calls and and plant bombs in the trade center with no one seeing you're giving the keystone cops a  tremendous amount of credit yeah well i mean look we're just we're we're not saying that i mean  we're not trying to make accusations here we're just saying there are questions that needs that are  being asked that are not being answered and they need to be answered fair enough and she's doing that 
[02:40:00]  right now i'm asking a question i would like answered do you honestly as an intelligent person  believe that the government was brilliant enough to pull off faking phone calls with loved ones  in answering this machine message form is it will be a lot easier and a lot more convenient for me  to take the assumption that i have faith in my country no no i'm not asking that there are a lot  of discrepancies all i'm asking for is a new investigation well what i'm asking you is that's  that's again talk about parroting you could there's a good word you use parroting because that's also 
[02:40:30]  parroting you're doing exactly what he's accused everybody else of doing you're parroting now i'm asking  you forget the rhetoric do you really think as a rational person that they faked relationships and phone  calls and that the family members bought it like your father or somebody could be faked he happens  to be flying that day and the government's going to call you as the plane is going i'm not taking one  stand or another i'm just not going to mindlessly absorb what i'm told but you just did in the fact  that you're saying that it could have been faked you're absorbing like yeah somebody's idea of of 
[02:41:00]  something that's preposterous and i'm saying as a as a thinking person does that make sense to you  like does i no one likes the official version we don't like to think that we really lost 3 000  people i'll call it our pants down we completely no one version sucks believe me that version stinks  i would love a different version unfortunately i really believe that's kind of the version so i'm  asking you like and you're saying well those phone calls instead of saying yeah that makes a lot of 
[02:41:30]  sense that would be a very difficult thing to pull off you go with i can't say that it does make  sense because it doesn't make sense to me so faked phone calls to relatives i don't know what the  answer is but it doesn't make sense well don't you know what the answer isn't that it's kind of hard  to pull off fake phone yeah you can't just over that one out the window as being not feasible or or  look i mean i'm not saying that the planes were faked on the plane i'm not saying that i'm not saying that  it's not but i'm not saying it's impossible not to fake phone calls we obviously do have the 
[02:42:00]  technology to do such a thing i mean but i'm doing where do you get that information but  would it just be easier to block the signal like for instance if we have the technology  which we maybe do to fake these voices and interpersonal relationships yeah to convince  wives and husbands a loved one spoken to their loved one in a dying moment don't we have the  technology just to block the signal so you don't have to worry about that i mean why would they  i mean again if we're discussing this why would they take 40 steps when they could take one or 
[02:42:30]  possibly two yeah look all i'm saying is they're trying to make a big event but dude i'm stick with  me i'm i'm going with what you're saying okay but just try to work with me you're telling me i'm not  thinking things out i am trying to think things out and there are certain things that as a thinking  person don't make sense to me why wouldn't they just block cell and all playing signals with that  technology what if if going by that if they possibly had that technology why not just block the signal 
[02:43:00]  and save yourself a tremendous amount of explaining and possible error thank god they didn't block the  signal because then people couldn't call uh ticket master and get their tickets for new year's  eve jimmy norton at the north fork that probably sold out already but but you understand what i'm  saying like why why put all of those well maybe maybe maybe to uh really convince the fact that  it was islamic terrorist maybe to i mean to bring that to bring that point home i mean if if you get 
[02:43:30]  rid of the speculation okay well you know they called and it's obviously islamic terrorists and you  don't think islamic terrorists would be so extreme and so hateful that they would do something like this  uh sir there is probably there is islamic islamic extremists there is terrorists that hate this  country but the thing is i want to believe the official story but there's so many things just  wrong with it they just don't but the but your version there's even more yeah there's no such thing  as my version there's a lot of things or whatever the let's say the opposition to to the official 
[02:44:00]  story research it's it's it's so out there and and complicated and impossible to pull off  uh that it it to stick to that story is is silly but alternative research you're being given  hold on alternative alternative alternative research everything you guys are saying we're trying to  somehow rationally like her thing with the phone call or or or okay let's walk through that a little  bit and all you guys are doing well we don't know it's almost like you throw out a theory and then 
[02:44:30]  when somebody's like slowly says okay well let's talk about that when it's kind of proved to be  ridiculous you go all right well we're not saying that that's the case we just don't know what the  case is i don't think you have proved it to be ridiculous and you didn't think my example hold  on you didn't think my example about the phone thing was pretty good see this is what the problem  with you guys is you never can see the point you don't think the point i made to her about  calling your relatives and faking a voice and an interpersonal relationship is a lot more  complicated than blocking a signal you don't think that's kind of a good point come on come on are you 
[02:45:00]  really going to tell me that you're supposed to be a thinking man here's what's going on you guys  are getting real nitpicky about little details and trying to call us out on this and that when  there's a bigger picture here and maybe there's maybe there's something we can agree on there's been  a serious lack of uh media integrity nitpicky i'm talking about your points integrity surrounding  9-11 you see what i'm saying this is what i meant about the child i'll say that there's a serious  lack of media integrity period okay period okay and especially concerning 9-11 i mean they went on 
[02:45:30]  the next day touting the the government's official there was a lot of uh real investigation there was  a lot of reports that came out prematurely i watched that day just like everyone else did  they were talking about how more planes were in the air how this is going here uh uh other buildings  were blowing up that they all turned out to be false because the media likes to jump the gun to get  the scoop on top of the white house to get the scoop on everything there were white planes on top of the  white house well you know something mentioned but you can see that there's a clip on youtube about it  that was reported on cnn a little while ago and they have a video of the a white plane that they 
[02:46:00]  say was a b-52 bomber but you know one of those doomsday planes that was on top of the white house  and there's no mention of that in the 9-11 official story either and i i don't even know what to think  about that i i don't know what to think about that either it just blows my mind who knows was it  was it a plane that was at altitude that was uh getting ready to be brought in no it was really low it  was just right on top of the white house well you can see that clip on youtube 9-11 white i don't  think i obviously i don't think we're privy to every security measure that the uh government brought 
[02:46:30]  out after that happened and so perhaps it was some type of uh uh defense that they put up i have no  idea i have no idea all i'm saying is there should be another investigation because there's so many just  unanswered questions there's so many things that are just are there but he accused us of being nitpicky  and this like when you're looking at well it's a bigger picture no not with every issue you're  talking about a bigger picture a higher morality is not what we're discussing we're talking about  specific things and i'm listening to what you guys are saying and you're saying i'm being nitpicky 
[02:47:00]  that was a very valid question you're accusing the government of mimicking  voices convincingly enough to convince relatives that they've spoken to a loved one in a moment of  death and i'm saying wouldn't it be easier to do this and you're saying i'm being nitpicky and that  you've somehow investigated further it seems to me like you don't like to concede a point or you  don't like to be shown that possibly the way you're arguing is not accurate you don't seem to like that  you seem to you're so desperate to hold on to this thing i think the big point here is that we need 
[02:47:30]  a new investigation you guys could use your celebrity to to call for a new investigation and  and to do some serious research into this subject i've already talked to you you guys are cowards i'm  sorry don't be so silly well you're being a little boy you're being a little boy because you don't  want to you don't want to look into this mommy and daddy not listen to you enough you're afraid for  your jobs if you start talking about 9-11 dude we're afraid for our jobs but it ain't 9-11 believe me  that's not the truth now and i think you you know that i'm looking you really think that we're 
[02:48:00]  afraid of it i am the one you silly little boy who doesn't know who screamed let's get 9-11 people  on here boy because you're being a little boy you called me a coward i'll call you a little boy  take it little bearded angry man i get it you're angry man i get it the government's bad i know i'm  a piece of shit i know oh oh is he angry no no be angry son come here son be angry little boy  whoa the angry young man walked away do you see do you see afraid for our jobs i am the one that said 
[02:48:30]  when we brought 9-11 people on at first there was something about the pentagon video i didn't like  i i started talking about on xm and said let's get people and talk about it right so that  that's just uninformed and he's walking away and i hope you have this on film because he was  getting his ass handed to him in an argument no one is screaming him down he's used to yelling and  shouting and having being dragged out of things and having people go ah and no one's gonna yell at  him no i'm gonna go every point he has right and talk about me look all we all 9-11 truthers are 
[02:49:00]  trying to do say your name for the record all right my name is luis baez all right um yep i'll be  curious um actually actually i have been listening to these uh to the ob anthony show since uh junior  high school so but louis do you not see the horse of the angry young man walking away i mean come on  man i like the you're a coward like like like he's this bastion of freedom and bravery no one's afraid  of the government coming down if the government isn't gonna cancel our show for talking about 9-11 
[02:49:30]  what is he talking about that's that childlike thing that i'm talking about yeah just don't  mention condi and if we were cowards we would have just not acknowledged  yeah why can't walk it we stop fucking you know kenny got in between you and us and i said no no  let's no let him talk you know what this is all about i love the dialogue because and i'm not to  not to put you down or anything but i love having just an intelligent dialogue between people that  have your point of view and the what you call official government stance on it because you really 
[02:50:00]  give yourselves enough rope to hang yourselves with we don't have to do much for your story to come off  looking silly and and looking uh uh ridiculous when you just talk all you guys have to do is talk  and it doesn't sound good anything that was really silly yeah so i don't think i've said maybe you  did maybe you didn't say anything silly but you don't think him walking away dramatically you cowards  doesn't that come off as kind of phony dude like we're here talking to the guy we were giving him 
[02:50:30]  a microphone to talk into it's do you not see a horse shit in that you know i i don't want to speak for  that guy i'm talking about you as a man don't you see the horse if anthony walked away angrily  and called you guys but he didn't he's standing here and we're putting you on the radio that's that  is true but you know the i think what we got to get back to is the main points right even if you  don't agree that all right are we going to agree to disagree we can say we agree to disagree i think  the thing is we should really have another investigation and look at some of the things 
[02:51:00]  that still don't make sense are still kind of crazy and take a look at them again spend some more money  on this because we only spent how many three million three million we spent more money on  clinton getting a blowjob in the west wing that was important okay that doesn't make sense because  a lot of people died a lot of people are still sick and we i i personally don't believe that we  know the real cause of what happened please tell me where he's going where is the angry young man  going where is the angry young man i don't know is he gonna pump his fist somewhere 
[02:51:30]  you agree with that though that we should have another investigation no i'll tell you why i'll  tell you dude i i mean look i don't think we need investigation if you want to go into security lapses  and stuff like that investigation as to how it happened absolutely sure how they've done a lot of  that like the fbi and the cia weren't talking to each other communication problem in the u.s  government my question is if okay we go with your officials uh what you believe 
[02:52:00]  yes there was a humongous failure within our defense tremendous yes tremendous why hasn't anyone  been fired uh why hasn't how come how come the people that are in charge of our security have not  been reprimanded or anything i don't know about that have gotten bigger bigger budget i would assume  i would assume they have been i mean that that's a that's i don't know i don't know names or people  that have these jobs but i know a lot more money has gone to uh these security agencies and thank  god it has i mean i'm going to use the term that you guys use well when when you guys got fired you 
[02:52:30]  guys screwed up meaning you guys got better positions when you guys got fired right these  people when they messed up they screwed up they got more money i think that they've been pretty raked  over the calls by the public and i i think it's a colossal embarrassment that they still got more  that week well the agency's got more money good donald rumsfeld got more money as well rumsfeld's  out he's out because he's making more money than he was before he mishandled the war i mean he did 
[02:53:00]  he did not do a great job and he's out what are you talking about he hasn't done a great job he's  done if he's making more money it's in the private sector he's done a great job but he's gotten  rewarded for not doing a great job in the private sector now people want to see him he's a celebrity  do you see what i mean about about the guy not acknowledging points like i asked again a point  about colin powell embarrassing himself in in the united nations about the the african uranium and  that was a tremendous blunder that was very easily pointed out to be horseshit and the whole and the 
[02:53:30]  united states looked ridiculous i mean and i asked him about that realistically like why all this brilliant  planning and stuff and then that what's easier to do plant explosives in the world trade center or  plant weapons of mass destruction in iraq why wouldn't you turn up and go aha look what we  found i think it's easier if we got this great intelligent government that could pull the wool  over everyone's eyes let's not forget that ronald reagan did sell saddam hussein absolutely because  we we were at war through them with iran and by the way we sold the shah of iran about 80 war planes 
[02:54:00]  before the ayatollah khomeini so when the ayatollah took over they had 80 of all war planes thank  god they couldn't operate them we love selling weapons believe me we've given weapons to some  fucking dumb people we're idiots we like to sell weapons we've had to shoot down our own  shit yeah it's ridiculous look look i'd love to continue this and stuff and we're freezing and  we got to get back to the studio we would like to thank you for giving us the time uh no problem  uh thank angry young man for us and yeah i got a question what was george uh steinbrenner thinking 
[02:54:30]  when he brought roger commons back to the yankees ah that's a good question answer what do you think  sir uh he's got no answer that's not what i'm here for guys i'm sorry he's wearing a yankees hat  i had to ask go ahead sir yes sir check out the book omissions and distortions and synthetic  terror by webster tarpley it'll be great com we are change.org check us out uh and as i said i i would  tell people to go there because when you go to these sites you do kind of see uh that it's always fact 
[02:55:00]  check you always fact check and it's the facts change as uh the situation and evidence changes  read the book though synthetic there like i said you guys usually give yourself enough rope do you  see that he's sulking over there and what happened was he walked away and nobody cared that he walked  away and he's sulking what is he what type of a guy jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy anything about him  no no no i know that but he's kind of like but that's me jimmy jimmy that's not what we hear jimmy 
[02:55:30]  no no i know but but i'm saying that that's kind of what's wrong with a lot of the guys that argue  that point is that you know man i'm cold why isn't there a government conspiracy that makes it warm  in december oh global warming or november whatever the fuck it is all right all right well all right  guys thank you stay warm thanks guys thank you sir oh my god all right i can't believe i forgot  for a walkover hell of a day for a walkover uh take a break no no no we'll keep walking a little  bit oh yeah do you want to talk to the angry young man are you done with him already all right he's 
[02:56:00]  he's so angry take care man thanks for fighting the good fight brave boy thank you thank you for  not buying into what the rest of the dummies do you know what anthony he's walking away with a sign  please film him walking away with i'm on the air sir wait this guy's so mad oh he is so angry no  this guy's so mad right here to your right one you just heard the whole thing eyewitness i just  drove here from downtown because of these fucking morons i saw the whole thing happen

[02:57:00]  jumping out of the buildings i wanted to talk to these guys though yeah well you know what the one  guy just walked away it was fun to watch him sulk away oh dude you know why you got him i knew that  and whenever you get one of these guys they fucking fold like the other two guys at least  were still trying to make their point but they weren't and they were distancing themselves from  the guy of course we don't know about that guy get away from me with that angry little boy 
[02:57:30]  shit man that's that rebellion against mommy and daddy i'm talking about yep it's not about the point of  you it's about that fucking that anger and then when you point out what about this well you know  man you just you're a coward you're nitpicking it's a bigger picture well the bigger picture is all the  details yeah so you bring up detail one by one and they never have a fucking answer for of course they  don't and he walks away with his sign and think hey brave warrior we'll put you on the radio brave  warrior hey hey reads everything you got a radio opportunity in two countries little bearded little 
[02:58:00]  bearded boy little bearded boy not the only one who cares little boy we should talk about who the  real cowards are those guys would never bring that shit to the uh nypd or anybody that's yeah  lost a loved one go down to the firehouse or or that guy that guy is livid want to confront him  personally he came in his uh his van just to confront those guys because he saw the whole  fucking thing go down he saw the actual planes hit the buildings and you know to him you want to talk  about cowards why don't they take their cause downtown and talk to some of the eye 
[02:58:30]  witnesses it's east side dave you know how you doing dave we gotta go inside yeah we gotta go  inside we must be late walk over yeah i know i know i'm such a coward i was scared oh i think  we're gonna have to agree to disagree on i think that's uh yeah that guy's so brave oh you  you got him so angry jimmy give me hours i spent at the cellar arguing beat it  i can tell you a story walking stupid with that we'll see you guys upstairs 
[02:59:00]  we're all gonna have the flu by monday i know my hands are chilly oh my my tootsies are cold  it's opie and anthony and of course jim norton whose tickets went on sale about an hour ago at this point  yes for the north fork theater out there in uh long island for his new year's eve show it's the old  westbury music fair i'm doing it new year's eve it's an eight o'clock show and i'm so happy that  my pal anthony will be there i will yes i am going for uh new year's eve i might go away that's the 
[02:59:30]  only reason i haven't committed i know if you're in town you come in yeah absolutely i'm going away  but i always come back to my native new york for new year's eve and uh i i was thinking like what are  we gonna do for new year's eve what the hell are we gonna do jimmy norton's playing well i'm there and  it's not the hbo hour just so people know you're not seeing the same material you saw no it's a  whole different hour and i'll be blowing everyone on the way out nice that's why i'm going you know  what i'm pissed off about speaking of jim norton and what just went on on the streets of new york 
[03:00:00]  uh pretty exciting stuff uh when they start saying you gotta read this book you gotta read this i'm  like well you gotta read happy endings it explains it all have you read happy endings right just throw  that into the mix there was two guys like there was three guys there and the girl and like a girl  just because she was young and she's just trying to video taping something with this really angry look  on her face because we should fill in the visuals now there was a little girl there the whole time  she couldn't have been more than five foot five foot one she held the camera right at anthony at first 
[03:00:30]  before jimmy uh came back on the scene and she had this really angry look on her face mad just really mad  but it's almost like you guys are you're arguing with the wrong people see we're not people that  wear suits to work every day you know we're not three fucking corporate guys it's like what are you  doing you stop acting like you're brave motherfucker you're not yeah we were arguing with you we put  you on the you guys we were we were brave to let them have their voice heard man it's it's just one  of those things where you know they came i heard a commotion behind us so i'm walking and i'm thinking 
[03:01:00]  what the is this going on and i look and it's like oh it's the 911 guys and then kenny stepped in  and i was like no let let let him come come on i want to hear him talk because like i said before  the best thing you can do is let these people talk because they will just hang themselves uh especially  if you can sit and and discuss with them the the worst thing to really do is just sit there and call 
[03:01:30]  them douchebags and assholes and and that because they they love that they love being yelled at with  nothing uh factual being thrown at him because then they could go yeah let's see he's too afraid  to talk or this that or the other thing but when you confront them and discuss uh the the whole  situation they fall apart well he said this is what the beauty of this the guy with the beard who i just  loved because he was everything that i knew he was i could look at him in 30 seconds and know what he was  sized him up and it was funny because the girl raises a point which has been raised by them 
[03:02:00]  before about voice masking and i ask a very valid question about faking an interpersonal relationship  with a loved one and convincing them and i've seen these people interviewed and you know what i believe  them i believe the mother and father i heard interview who said they were talking to their son of course  that building hit that that plane hit that second building and they said that their son was like like  going oh my god oh my god and i believe those parents so for me to believe those parents that 
[03:02:30]  means that the voice has to be masked the relationship has to be faked and so i say all  right well if they could do that why not just block the fucking signal so you don't have to worry about  that yeah you're nitpicking i'm taking what you just said and going a step further with it and i'm  allowing you time to talk about it that's why when i got a nasty email or whatever which is fine  from one of the 911 guys after i was calling them children that's why it's not that you don't agree  with me it's that you have this childlike way of arguing it was like i'm asking you fucking valid 
[03:03:00]  questions that i've asked myself where why are you not asking that question you think we don't do  research hey motherfucker why not just put two big trucks in the fucking in the basement and knock  both buildings down into downtown new york yeah it killed 50 000 people yeah and do it when  everyone's in there i shouldn't be yelling yeah do it when the buildings are full yeah and don't  give anyone time to get out and if you're going to bring down planes you want to talk about a  spectacle bring them down with missiles why not if you have all this brilliant technology and you can  voice mask and you can hide bodies why not just missile down a few planes and why do you missile down 
[03:03:30]  planes with 30 people on them why not fucking right you loaded 767 fully loaded planes it's it  they didn't want fully loaded planes because they didn't want to fight on their hands listen it's  too easy an explanation to not be a valid explanation sure sometimes they if you want to put a conspiracy  together you want it to look like it was easy this would involve thousands of people that need to 
[03:04:00]  keep their mouth shut and the government can't keep a leak fucking plugged uh when it comes to to  anything scooter libby couldn't shut up yeah she couldn't keep her fucking listen i know i jump in here  because the listeners are dying to get in on this they just heard this for the last i don't know  over an hour and they're dying to talk uh john in houston what's up yeah hey guys i just wanted to uh  god just i'm so proud of how you handle those 9-11 we're on xm now right yes yes those 11 
[03:04:30]  i hate those and then his phone cut out when he cursed  that's a conspiracy man man they didn't want to hear me that proves the mergers going through  we're cowards man we're afraid for our jobs  really when you blow it down they just want to feel special they want to feel like they're the only  sentient free-thinking people in a sea of zombies who are all either in on it or duped they want to 
[03:05:00]  feel like they're in the matrix or the x yeah they want to feel like the matrix the x files they  want to be those three guys on the x files yeah they want to be the underground rebellion man yeah  like we know look dude we know let's we'll get together in my basement ma ma we're doing things  down here it's a conspiracy one guy was definitely listening to to you guys and he had an open mind  about things and louise and and no not the the tall guy he's like you know i just don't feel 
[03:05:30]  comfortable with what they have told me could you see him in the house going this is a conspiracy  i know absolutely and look at this picture right what do you say guys sunny d sunny d everyone  upstairs for some sunny d but the mom all he was saying was i don't feel comfortable the other guy  had an agenda the little girl at the camera had the agenda the yankee hat guy with all those guys  weren't willing to listen to anything i disagree about the yankee hat guy i think he was listening even  though he wasn't i'm not saying he came over to our side i don't think he did no no he wasn't i 
[03:06:00]  don't think he was so irrational but i i don't think that none of it sunk in either i don't think  with the question of why not block that technology instead of voice faking i don't think that that  right do you know how hard it would be you know they like thinking of this a massive technological  conspiracy look on a personal level do you know how hard it would be for for somebody in in some  government agency in the deep in the pentagon or underground somewhere coming up with jim norton 
[03:06:30]  masking technology to then call his mother and father leave a message that not only would sound  exactly like him but but like personally you just would know it's your son or daughter or loved one  or husband or whatever you just know it no one's gonna fake it they're not gonna put fucking you know  they're holding frank caliendo in the pentagon uh and he's he's there blurting out people's voices 
[03:07:00]  so john madden had to make a lot of phone calls we're on a plane here yeah every time we're gonna  go boom it's gonna it's not happening like that let's get we gotta get some of these people in we  got chuck from uh new york city chuck he's a cop what's up buddy hey guys how you doing i just  wanted to thank jimmy for putting that 911 he hit in his place oh sure i gotta deal with these people  all the time and it's i can't personally say anything to him on the street i'll lose my job  get in trouble right but he did a fantastic job i'd love to see him go to a precinct or a firehouse 
[03:07:30]  with that drivel well so he got angry and walked away he stormed away it was almost like he called us  uninformed and he called me a coward and then i call him a little boy and then he tries to rile himself up  with you call me a boy yeah yeah yeah boy now what don't try to intimidate me mother you know  well that's because he also looked over he's like fuck you but oh what's the matter you lost  little temper tantrum don't try to intimidate me he's got some childhood issues you know 
[03:08:00]  he's a spoiled fucking white kid yep all right who these guys at the door and  keith uh it's conspiracy see the government came in and shot us keith and louis oh no now  they're driving a car in  what's up keith we're afraid we're using our jobs  by far the best walkover ever and i i remember having to dodge these guys back in undergrad uh  all over the waco thing in the early 90s and they used to scream at us about waco and we had to dodge 
[03:08:30]  them on the way to class but you know the one thing jimmy is and i don't believe that they were  able to pull off faking all these calls but the one thing i wanted them to say was if they if they  were able to fake them it was it would have been the perfect thing to do because it is what sold  all of us on the fact that it really really did happen i'll be honest dude and not not i mean i'm  gonna let you finish but that's not what sold me to be very honest what what sold me was watching the 
[03:09:00]  planes hit yeah i mean and i'm not trying to be a shithead about it but i mean honest to god  that is what sold me that sold me watching the buildings burn for a while watching them collapse  the entire scene is what sold me that the and the the knowing that muslim extremists uh uh hated  our way of life hate our way of life um were planning things had done things in the past numerous  things overseas and uh domestically and to our our warships uh the coal had been bombed embassy 
[03:09:30]  bombings uh the world trade center back in the 90s and then this is just it's a it's a natural  unfortunately a natural progression of what was happening at the time so why can't they accept it  why can't they just accept hey this is what happened and and if they were going to hit the  pentagon and fake it wouldn't they have done more damage i mean it's just it none of it would make  sense no to to fake like this i wanted to take up for the the other two dudes uh the the look maybe 
[03:10:00]  the little angry guy was carrying all the pot and they didn't want to get cut off you don't call him  out on the radio so angry but it's like that anger it's like don't come at me with that stupid  you're no angrier than me self-important yeah stop it you're not smart he's solving the problem  no he's so much smarter and he knows you don't you're a sheep yeah we're all sheep and puppets  and listening to the media uh we're gatekeepers we're the gatekeepers man we made up a cool name 
[03:10:30]  for people that just fucking listen to the news we're the gatekeepers we call out the media more  than anybody and we're the gate openers you know they we're the first ones to call the media out on  their bullshit little guy go yell at mommy with that gatekeeper shit i'm not a suburban housewife you  idiot go to fucking toys r us and get a sherlock holmes detective kit and put the hat on with the  magnifying glass and look for clues a little brat don't try those little argument techniques when i'm 
[03:11:00]  willing to listen to your point and then go what about this and instead of going like any rational  person when you say wouldn't it make more sense we go yeah that would actually make a lot more  sense but what they say is a you're nitpicking yeah be you're parroting when that's all they do is  parrot and danny raised a funny point he's like they fucking say how you can't rely on the media for  anything until something happens that that sides with them and they will you look it was reported  it was reported in the media that this happened what the media you just said sucked and that you  can't trust you can't trust them right just plant a few weapons in iraq we would look good see that 
[03:11:30]  was a whole nother thing to us now it's like we we go to iraq and by the way uh using 9-11 as a way  to get into iraq is ridiculous because at any time they had broken enough sanctions that we could have gone  in we always had we had planes flying over on a daily basis they were there were planes flying  over the no-fly zone uh they were breaking sanctions we could have bombed them at any time we wanted uh  we didn't need to do that and if if they were able to plant explosives in the world trade center both 
[03:12:00]  buildings while people are working to bring it down in a controlled explosion explosion you mean to tell  me you can't get weapons of mass destruction in to iraq to say aha see or a couple they didn't come  up with any we look like assholes idiots and in afghanistan we fucking boot the taliban and now  they're coming back yeah we have done a horrible job terrible so what was the fucking use because  we're not good at that stuff we're just good at conspiracies just i don't get it yeah oil's a hundred 
[03:12:30]  dollars a barrel what did we do we did what do we want to do well we're good at mimicking our plan  is working perfectly we're really good at mimicking voices though yes yes that seems to be what really  came out of this hey imitation i can't believe sounded like the real victim let's go to idaho uh  james they're calling from all over the country right now james what's up hey james and we're not  by the way hold on hold on i want to make this perfectly clear because we get called out on this all 
[03:13:00]  the time i'm just going right up the row i mean if someone agrees with those guys they'll get  through trust me i'm not trying to just take pause you know pro ona and jim norton calls right now  or mostly uh jimmy and and i i i just yelled at the guy and then he that one guy ran off in fear  by the way we didn't we didn't uh oh is that the bearded guy no before you came back one guy's like  trying to say that you know whatever yeah it was another guy and i just got right in his face and  he just took off he didn't want any part of that he was the guy that bearded guy was talking to on 
[03:13:30]  the corner oh man oh he came back the other guy he was standing on the corner okay another  angry one that ran away yeah well they get really angry and run that's what they do no one's beating  you up silly well i got a little pissed because he's like you guys are uninformed and you're not  smart  tasering in traffic oh in traffic all right go ahead james idaho what's up um a couple things i thought  was hilarious is one was when uh opie was just like don't mess with me dude i'm serious you don't  want to mess with me and would just get so pissed off but another thing was that when one of that 
[03:14:00]  thing occurs i don't remember which one was uh saying excuse me was saying uh how funny it was  that you guys take the littlest things and try and prove that it's uh that it was real the littlest  nitpicky things when every point they had was a littlest nitpicky yeah yeah that you couldn't even  believe little little minor details and then when you argue them they go oh well those are nitpicking  details yeah talking about the big picture my ass off it's amazing how they they they they need a 
[03:14:30]  certain type of relationship here's what they thrive on very quick interactions yeah like quick  one or two sentences yelled at each other where they can hold up a sign and be the angry young man  blow out some stat that isn't back they can't back up they need a quick thing they need to anger  people to the point where they become irrational and they could stand there and go look now you're  irrational uh but when you give them a forum and actually debate them back and forth they come 
[03:15:00]  off looking like idiots it's like when that little girl like he called us parrots and then she said well  isn't there only 0.008 what a 0.008 chance of getting a call through where did you hear that  yeah where did you read that right some of the carriers i've had over the years there's a 0.008 uh  chance of a signal in my house right never mind on a plane hey let's go to uh rick in new orleans uh  rick nalens nalens check it in y'all doing this morning all right look i normally you guys i love 
[03:15:30]  you to death but your politics normally drives me crazy i'm screaming at the radio all the time  but i gotta admit y'all were more than fair to these guys today i don't believe they're conspiracy stuff  even though i disagree with your politics but y'all were more than fair to them you didn't ridicule  them today you gave them more than enough fair chance and they destroyed themselves and i only  to be honest with you i only started really insulting that look that guy because of his attitude the 
[03:16:00]  other two guys i didn't agree with but i wasn't insulting them but i the white dude with the beard  who you guys couldn't you could see like the this when i was talking about one day i could see that  he had no answer for it but wouldn't say like i don't know what that is um then he goes into this  other rhetoric and he was the guy i had a real problem with because he's everything i'm talking  about when i say spoiled children not the other two guys louise and the other guy i don't know if  the guy was an indian dude or whatever i'd be a little misguided but i don't agree with those dudes  yeah but i think that their motives are a little bit cleaner i think that that guy is trying to portray 
[03:16:30]  the angry young man and be a leader of some sort yeah he wants to be a leader it makes him feel like  he's got a mission yeah he's leading uh the the pack of people uh that are way in the minority  that that i think that there was this vast conspiracy and he's going to be the guy  that exposes it somehow it's like his dream of being this this a superhero and he's the guy that's  going to crack this open yeah and it's like when you argue like kennedy conspiracy i've gone back and 
[03:17:00]  forth with because i've read a lot from both sides and i've even said i know it sounds crazy but i'm  actually leaning away from a conspiracy in the kennedy assassination yeah um i'm not 100 convinced  either way but it's like when you talk about conspiracy theorists you really have to know  your shit to argue with a conspiracy theorist because a lot of those guys have very rational  explanations for everything that happened like to prove a conspiracy and yeah when you hear people 
[03:17:30]  that know all the facts and argue with a conspiracy theorist then the conspiracy theorists look stupid  it's almost like you really have to know shit to argue either way yeah they both sound rational  i can see why you'd feel either way but on this one after arguing with these guys i can't see why  you're right that way fox dolder hey rick thank you i thought it was  thanks man let's let's go to mike the trucker joke yeah mike that guy was a  dolt oh mikey i would i would like to say that two girls one cup was an inside job and if you 
[03:18:00]  guys would just open your eyes and read the book the brown stain of shame that's right  what's the special about it called loose stools you know i'm with mike though i think there's an  old switcheroo going on in that video now see come on i'm sorry oh study what's the matter you can't  accept the fact that that's a real cup of shit and girls are eating it study the consistency of  the ship after it went into the cup and they do a cutaway look and it looks a commission came out 
[03:18:30]  and said that's real shit and that's more like ice cream to me at this point she's throwing up into  the other girls now well yeah what do you think they drew the line i'll puke into her mouth and  she'll eat it but the duty thing well yeah why would they fake the voices why not just  shit into the mouth i don't know what i'm talking about you guys are being glib man man if that guy  was the typical man like when i do that that is him the beard man and the the wounded shot like the 
[03:19:00]  angry wounded look it's believe the government man yeah okay i'm not your 58 year old lady neighbors  would i love to see him try to explain himself out of a beheading sitting there in front of that  god-awful flag can i jump in here for a sec because uh someone's pointed this out and it's absolutely  true i got i got out the easy way and i'll explain but let me read the email norton and ann are arguing 
[03:19:30]  logically and opie does don't mess with me asshole and that was the only point that got through to them  they didn't talk to over the rest of the time brilliant opie well done i'll tell you why i like jimmy  said to argue with conspiracy guys you have to know your shit i don't know my shit when it comes  to this i meant for jfk not for these guys these guys you don't you you know enough to argue with  them i meant jfk but i i just couldn't be bothered i just love letting them hang themselves  it's great i i can't be bothered with that stuff because i just know nothing ever gets accomplished 
[03:20:00]  it's so fucking i get so frustrated that i can't be like jimmy where he goes you know and just  calms everybody down and listens to him i'm just not that guy i don't have that personality i get  frustrated and i don't want to deal with it because i know they're never going to see it  any other way the good thing is though especially on a forum like like our show instead of just if  you're in a bar arguing like that it really becomes frustrating but i like the fact that on this forum  on our show you get to expose people like that so that maybe somebody who's teetering and is on the 
[03:20:30]  fence isn't just going to buy into that shit um automatically do your own research and shit you  know absolutely but just don't take their word for it like that it's it's ridiculous it was funny  when he said well you got microphones and he said it into a microphone it's like we're not asking you  to talk to a construction cone on 57th street you fucking cunt did we ever pull the mic away did we  ever pull the mic away from any of their faces oh it's just silly you're gonna bop them on the 
[03:21:00]  head with it here's a guy mike on long island here's a guy hey what's going on guys hey man  i've been listening to you for a damn long time 1027 back in like 80 uh 99 2000 later longer  nice important part here is i'm a jet mechanic i was in the air force for four years and i'm telling you  there is absolutely no way the pentagon happened the way it happened there's no way a fuselage can blow  through a wall that's so solid that it's going to make engines totally disappear it's impossible 
[03:21:30]  can i ask you a question about this and i'm not a mechanic obviously i did see a video it was a  military test video an older one where they show up because the people have raised this argument about  how it wouldn't demolish if it hit concrete yeah and this was not a passenger plane this was like a  military fighter there's a f-4 phantom oh you know the video yeah and they showed it flying  into a a solid brick type of thing and it did disintegrate it was here's the thing the whole 
[03:22:00]  thing would disintegrate the fuselage is hollow there's no way a hollow fuselage would penetrate  a wall that's going to totally evaporate turbines turbines are made of titanium they're almost  impossible to melt they found engine parts dude where is they didn't find the engine parts from those  planes yes they did they found engine all those engine parts were dude they found engine parts  they found turbine blades from commercial jetliners yes they did not holy you see they were small you 
[03:22:30]  can pick them up with your hands dude there are pictures of emergency workers and firemen walking  around debris that is obviously airplane parts there is a picture of a wheel hub but and they hold on  hold on there's a picture of a wheel hub at this pentagon site and they matched it exactly to a 757's  wheel hub right they put a picture of that wheel hub next to the picture of a 757's wheel hub 
[03:23:00]  and it matched perfectly well that's great but how how would a fuselage bust through a wall that an  engine can't tell me what do you mean the engine did but the engines did bust through the walls where  are you getting your info from there was there it is there's the wreckage of the wheel hub found at  the pentagon i'm looking at a picture of the top row shows it that is a picture of the wheel hub the  bottom is a 757's landing gear look at the rim look at the hub it's exactly the same it was a 757 i'm 
[03:23:30]  not what do you think happened then dude like yeah what do you think happened he said something you  kind of blew off like they did find that you okay well no what do you think i i never saw it i never  saw any credible footage and there were uh parts of the fuselage that showed uh a side panel windows  um it didn't disintegrate the clip that me and jimmy were talking about with the uh the phantom  flying into a cement wall right that's concrete that's uh supposed to be a security check for 
[03:24:00]  nuclear reactor oh is that okay yeah so i mean it was thick fucking concrete not brick wall of a  pentagon right uh and and it was doing like supersonic speed into this wall and completely  disintegrated into dust right uh that isn't what happened at the pentagon it went through a brick wall  it went through windows um through a brick wall if all the engine parts were on the outside of the  building no it wasn't it was in the rings the pentagon's made up of rings right and it was 
[03:24:30]  within the rings they found parts of the airport of the uh uh the jet why was the hole so small the  hole is only big enough for the fuselage to go through the wings and the engines did not make it  through no you see marks on the building where the wings went through the plane didn't hit direct  either it didn't hit at a 90 degree angle it hit at an angle so it doesn't look like this cartoon  version of a plane going through a wall where it's a perfect silhouette of a plane it hit on  an angle right so that's why you're not getting this um uh wingspan uh uh definite line on the 
[03:25:00]  building it but the fuselage parts were there it hit at a high speed and it hit a brick fucking wall  so yeah a lot of it disintegrated but there were enough parts there to identify it as a 757  yeah well i mean it's they have they have three different video cameras that they the fbi uh  you saw that right well i'll tell you i don't like the pentagon yeah i saw that they only show that 
[03:25:30]  one video then why would they release uh one shot from around the it's horrible video it's so slow  from a surveillance camera that you really only get one frame where you see a blurry object it's very  hard to to see what that is if you ask me i think it's odd that the pentagon doesn't have  fucking cameras everywhere i guarantee that would have caught that i guarantee you they do they do  and they they haven't released it but you gotta think why would have released them no i don't  necessarily agree with that dude because they the government and i'm not saying it's right but why 
[03:26:00]  they conceal certain things whether it's for their own security they don't want to show you where their  cameras are or they don't want to absolutely show you how fucking a week the defense was around  that maybe i honestly don't know but to me that's a flaw in the thinking of the government that  doesn't mean it didn't happen what do you think it was that hit the pentagon a missile a missile what  now now let me ask you let me ask you something let's just let's just these deconstruct this for  a minute why would they use uh two aircraft on the world trade center and then hit the pentagon 
[03:26:30]  with a missile because everybody's gonna see the uh the world trade center everybody's in new york but  why take the chance there's there's rush hour traffic going through dc at that hour a highway  uh next to the pentagon why take the chance that people are going to see a missile and not use an  airplane where is the airplane that supposedly uh crashed into the pentagon where are the people that  died in in the crash of the pentagon where is all that well that's the question no it's not 
[03:27:00]  it's not a question they're dead they're they're dead their families have not seen them since yeah  and honestly i don't put it past them there if they were willing to sacrifice the lives of the two  planes that went into the the uh the world trade center i don't put it past them to to sacrifice  the people now how are they sacrificed that you mean to tell me that the faa and all the air traffic  controllers uh saw a plane that went off the radar and then what flew very low to a point where it 
[03:27:30]  it went somewhere where did that plane go that's the question no it's not a question it flew into the  pentagon when the planes went into the world trade center they had to land like 50 000 planes that were  in the air whatever it was maybe it's like four thousand five thousand whatever it's a lot of planes  and they kept track of every single one of them except the one that supposed to fly into the  pentagon where did it go well according to uh it landed uh in ohio this is what i'm trying to get 
[03:28:00]  you to say it landed in ohio and then what happened to the people yeah they filed them off and i guess  they executed them all i think now now sir is that not the silliest thing i didn't spend four years  figuring this plan out no no dude but listen to this listen to this they're working in a sweatshop  in cleveland making nike sneakers i just feel bad that they ought to go to cleveland if you're going 
[03:28:30]  to get people if you're going to get people to be silent about executing other american citizens  getting off a commercial airliner why not just say it was a missile and set up an arab yeah exactly  like why deny that it was a missile like why not just say and there was a missile attack and then make  it look like like like paint a complete picture that al-qaeda did it like if you're going to fake  that why because they're not that they're not that advanced they have box cutters they don't have 
[03:29:00]  missile technology i mean technology and the ability who has box cutters who has the terrorists on the  planes had box cutters they didn't have missiles wait how did no no how but that's not the terrorists  about the government there are no terrorists on the thing remember that you said that's right there  aren't any terrorists i forgot they shot the missile right so i'm saying well of course they have  technology bin laden's a billionaire dude he came in that then i broke how would he have a cruise  missile in washington exactly well then how would they land a plane and convince people to kill  american citizens without talking and now no one saw they couldn't keep abu graber's secret a couple 
[03:29:30]  of nude fucking savages on a leash lindy england piles people in a pyramid and has a few laughs come  on the whole fucking thing falls apart that's a few laughs points with that thumb military guys do  fucked up shit like that yes they do sir but you're right but in the age of when you got you  got halliburton and you got uh kbr and you got all these uh the outside forces the mercenaries that  they're hiring yes there's just as many of them as us in iraq but bro bro hold on that doesn't count 
[03:30:00]  for landing a commercial airliner in ohio in the u.s and nobody's seeing it you're implying that air  traffic control was at the ohio airport that it landed at well didn't see it and then nobody  worked in the hangar never saw the plane and where do they back the plane out but there's  there's an explanation on the as a feedback okay people uh in cleveland and the plane they all went  through a wood chipper right here in brainerd right in brainerd right here in brainerd we could  take care of it right here in cleveland dude do you see how ridiculous it is like a wood chipper 
[03:30:30]  break it down logically i i understand there are a lot of questions but when i see the picture  of the pentagon being penetrated by a by a plane that uh like i said the engine parts that i saw  were not the turbines from you saw what you wanted to say look like from a helicopter is it we saw  what what we saw what they they've matched them up with it's easy to look at a picture it's it's  simple children could do this anyone could match it up just by looking at it you're saying that somebody 
[03:31:00]  matched them up who did the government but dude no no there are photographs oh my god everything  has to be fixed you're going into eight billion things that had to have been done in complete  silence and security for all this to happen oh so the picture i'm looking at right now of the rim  that's in the wreckage is faked instead of an easy answer a 757 flew into the pentagon 
[03:31:30]  god well it's not an easy answer it is an easy answer people that hated us figured out a great  fucking plan and fucked us in our ass and he denied it as soon as we asked him if he wanted us if he  wanted to do it and he wanted us to know he did it who denied it who do we what do we call up a cave  yeah bin laden we didn't call bin laden we were trying to get bin laden handed over to us the taliban  said no so we attacked them and let me ask you a question and do interview they have with him after  9 11. who interviewed who fucking cares what he says okay dude honest to god you know where is the 
[03:32:00]  plan though here's the thing when they finally came out in the video that he said yeah i did it  it didn't even look like him you can't rule out the bermuda trying let me ask you a question let's be  honest it's true too if you say that they look like helicopter parts yes the government is claiming a  plane hit the pentagon so they to make it look real sprinkle helicopter parts and hope that nobody  notices after this vast conspiracy of landing people and executing them they go ah we got a box of 
[03:32:30]  helicopter parts let's just sprinkle them around we forgot to bring parts do you do but do you understand  why we think this god i i i got it i understand why the whole country and the whole world is duped nobody  wants to believe this it's hard to believe it's impossible i don't want to fucking believe this  i fought for my country i was in the first iraq war i don't want to believe this but believe me  if you go to ae american i mean the architectural engineers ae911truth.com they will spell out 
[03:33:00]  of course they will actual point of view how there's absolutely no way these buildings came down and  anthony as far as putting all those explosions explosives in the buildings yeah if you see what the  actual structure is the the the backbone of the twin towers is the elevator shaft the elevator shaft is  all you need to blow up oh stop it you mean to tell me the world trade center rested on its elevator  shaft i i've been in construction for many years dude i might not have been at a level of the world 
[03:33:30]  trade center but i know damn well that they don't bear the brunt of the weight of a building the size of  the trade center on its elevator shaft well maybe you should look into it there's it was something  called a center core right that ran up and and the outside of the building itself was all no hold on  hold on dude dude listen to me the the middle part was a structure made of steel the outside was also 
[03:34:00]  structural that's why the windows had to be so small and between that were uh metal beams that ran and  held the floors they all got soft and fucking bent and collapsed and the floors falling on each other  made the buildings fall if anyone tries to convince me that explosives were placed in there to bring  it down in a controlled blast i've seen enough controlled explosions and what it takes to do that  it's impossible to rig that building down what did you see what they look like when they go down 
[03:34:30]  because they look just like the twin towers no it doesn't it does not watch a fucking controlled  explosion watch the twin towers you will see and hear pop pop pop pop you'll see the light and then  you'll see the building collapse in a clean controlled explosion hear the popping no you heard a heavy  fucking rumble of concrete turning to dust and you saw some sparks from flammable objects friction and 
[03:35:00]  whatnot not fucking a controlled explosion and how do you again how do you get that shit in there when  people are working the cia had their headquarters in the buildings oh my god the cia dude the cia guys  wear suits what what do you think that they do you think oh my god dude do you think honestly did you  know that hold on hold on hold on do you really think a bunch of cia guys were running around while  people are on their typewriters wiring 110 story buildings to fall down what do you think the cia 
[03:35:30]  does why not just go what do you think they do obviously not pay attention to muslims that are  in this country training on airplanes and i'll tell you what else they don't do they don't have good  cover stories for colin powell no they have shitty cover stories that make them look like a douche i'll  tell you what else they don't do they don't plant weapons of mass destruction well you know like dickheads  in front of the whole planet mike what do you say what do you say the nypd and the the fire department  here in new york and all the volunteers that were actually collecting uh airplane parts uh down there at ground  zero no i'm not saying airplanes didn't go into the trade centers that obviously happened we all 
[03:36:00]  saw it well there's a lot of people that don't think even that happens well that's crazy well  thank you there are people that that do think that's even crap so no that's not what i'm saying  that's just insanity all right dude dude can we just look i've i've agreed to disagree no i got even a  better solution yeah i think we all need to take a breath uh-huh and if he doesn't have this ready he is  fired i think we all need a lope wiser wow let's rock can we all agree on a lope wiser 
[03:36:30]  mike can you agree on a lope what's a lope wiser oh jimmy you've missed so much jimmy being a star out  it's a lope wiser it's a lope just enjoy it you got lope wisers for everybody oh look at he's freaking  out come on and it's not ever performing oh e-rock oh i got it oh wait you did i think i heard  what i told you so then i'm a lope wiser now i got to apologize to you rock where is it they don't  yes i do because his feelings were hurt 
[03:37:00]  hey e-rock there you go it's one oh jimmy it tastes so good i didn't say that there's alcohol in  them so i think you could have one no there should be coming them what is a lope wiser oh  well the radio show that replaced us in west palm beach florida oh my god i have an ant still light  like they give people lope wisers loper if p if you tell me that people call the loper show and say i 
[03:37:30]  want a lope wiser i'm gonna kill everyone in this room and then myself people don't call he just offers  them up really good sound effects though yeah yeah was it a shotgun and then fucking a pez what is  that you're fucking fizzing cunt a lope wiser it's a shot of cum with blood in it i just have to say  this sir boosh boosh boosh all right all right all right all right mikey thank you i think we gave  you some good time all right thank you all right thank you all right thank you all right and he's 
[03:38:00]  uh let's go to doug in austin texas uh doug yeah how you guys doing all right uh yeah i worked two  years next to the pentagon that stuff is not fake the the building's reconstructed you can see the new  construction these people are losing their mind i just want to know if they could come in for the  dumb off with rich boss yeah well would be lovely wouldn't it yeah they gotta i i i i'm stunned that 
[03:38:30]  people cannot just accept what happened we we fought i would love to think that this country and  we all would have loved to have thought this country had the security that we always thought it did  where the the grounds the grounds of the pentagon opened and these super missiles shot out and would  save everybody it didn't work we we were we had our pants down that the cia and the fbi uh talked to 
[03:39:00]  each other and could have weeded out uh terrorists that were taking flying lessons in our own country  well i can say too is uh you know it's a pissing contest between government agencies they're not  going to talk that way i work for the government well they they they do a lot better now they've uncovered  some some nasty shit uh it's amazing and they say it all the time you know the the what do they say uh  uh the terrorists only have to be right once you know it's like they they we we have to find every 
[03:39:30]  single terrorist plot i guess but one only has to slip through and it's a huge uh uh event i'm i'm  trying to keep uh some of the funny in here brian has a great one from south jersey all right as uh  angry typing uh guy because i've seen a guy in discovery say it was so  and the gravity argument how do you make things fall faster than gravity fall faster unless you're 
[03:40:00]  putting like rockets on the debris as it's falling when people come at me with that one well it fell  faster than gravity i'm like oh boy i gotta i gotta i gotta go to to the gym and yeah work out or  some i can't be bothered with this how does that seriously that's where they assume that all the  floors are detonated at once and instead of uh the floors um hitting each other and pancaking like they  did wham wham wham wham right that can only fall at a certain speed but but the whole thing fell uh 
[03:40:30]  like it was free falling you know how funny it would be to like say you have some 9 11 conspiracy videos  and you start like a minute of it and then you just show the guy getting fucked by the horse in  seattle  that to me is more believable than a big horse  went to the pentagon  it was a big horse cock  the first video on that you're screaming he mentioned 
[03:41:00]  i thought oh man i'm way off i really thought i was going for normal  by the way because the government has this voice technology fan uh you do realize that you did not  talk to mother recently holy that was that was a conspiracy that was awfully pleasant of wow  of epic proportions um the first clip they have to disprove everything yeah is dan rather saying  that uh number seven looked like uh he's like we've seen this before when they've demolished 
[03:41:30]  buildings so if expert dan rather was dan rather and the fact of the matter is to the layman  it would look like a building being demolished because they didn't tip over it didn't fall over  it fell uh straight down in its own footprint yeah in its own footprint as they say so if  somebody in the news is describing it as that you don't take it literally that what they're saying  is that it was a controlled explosion it looks like something we're familiar seeing which is a 
[03:42:00]  controlled explosion but they just eat that shit up and go yeah see dan rather said it  he also spent 20 minutes on his coke  collar and lapels trying to make sure he looks good before he goes on  tv rather is a bucket of jizz who's now suing for 70 million dollars he should shut his face yeah  what's the frequency kenneth hey mike north carolina see mike i don't know what's going on in north 
[03:42:30]  carolina but they love this stupid show hey gotta love it hey listen guys i was in the marines for  six years did two tours you know i saw these terrorists hurrah hurrah but listen up my biggest  point is if these idiots honestly believe that the government and our country purposely killed all  these people and especially that moron who said they empty a plane load of people off and executed  them yeah why in god's name would you stay in this country yeah who's who's staying here if they have 
[03:43:00]  to carry on execution right of innocent americans of some guy with a fucking twa bag he's just standing  there with his carry on do we take the carry-ons or do we leave our laptops while we're being mass  executed yeah i don't have to uh why do these people want to stay in our country you know what  yeah i mean hey if they think our government did it you know what i'm sure iran is looking for some  more uh citizens you guys feel free go move over there i'm sure you'll love it thank you for flying united 
[03:43:30]  airlines thank you for flying come again please thank you for flying bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye thank you for  flying watch yourself watch your step miss thank you for flying thank you thank you for flying  bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye they're just gonna shoot everybody how is a flight attendant who they had  that long tape conversation with where she's going yes our number one has been stabbed our number two  is dead however she's talking about the pilot is that a voice acting lessons it's just acting lessons 
[03:44:00]  shooting lessons by the way i want to do with these guys these conspiracy theories i want to sit  him on my lap and go what's the matter little fella yeah what do you need what is it a hug as we  were uh talking about that by the way the msnbc had an interesting story some guy's not allowed to  to have his get osama uh license plate on his yeah motor vehicle told him no he's not allowed to  they don't get osama you are not allowed to have what they deem offensive uh words on your license plate 
[03:44:30]  your personalized license plate and they uh saw that as being offensive get osama what how is that  offensive and then we got the british teacher in sudan we never got to this this i love i i wish they  were going to be caning this woman um but unfortunately i think they're just going to put her in prison  for naming a teddy bear having her class name a teddy bear and that uh she they decided on muhammad  right well people in the sudan calling and fan raised a good point like what do you say like 
[03:45:00]  you think that they can't behave irrationally and there's thousands of sudanese calling for her death  calling for a death waving machetes around yet it couldn't have been that mentality that brought  down the towers and the pentagon it was our own country let's get the news story out there so  everyone knows what we're talking about it's quick 54 year old jillian gibbons was found guilty  of inciting religious hatred and sentenced to 15 days in prison for naming her classroom's teddy bear  muhammad the lawyer for the british woman arrested in sudan says his client never meant to insult the 
[03:45:30]  islamic faith gibbons lawyer describes her emotional state after receiving the guilty verdict  she feels calm and she i think she's expecting that because she's expecting that because there's many  many people are shouting out in the street and so and so so it's i think it's even serious for us  her lawyer plans to appeal the guilty verdict god how that appeal will go well i'm sure she'll get 
[03:46:00]  she'll get 10 years they'll give her a clitoral circumcision  fucking idiots hey here's uh that is i i am i am glad because when when these do-gooders go into these  savage uh countries and try to deal with these people as if they are human fucking beings  i i i i cherish when they get fucked over by their own do-goodness and think that they're going to be 
[03:46:30]  treated rationally by these fucking savages she probably goes there thinking i'm gonna do good i'm  gonna teach the children this is going to be great and she's some dumb fat english broad uh so she goes  there and they have a little naming of the teddy bear the class decides a muhammad someone rats  are out and uh they were talking about giving her 50 lashes and when it made the news people got  outraged and i guess uh they sentenced her to 15 days in a prison which over there has just got to be 
[03:47:00]  a treat uh and i say good this this should be a message to everyone to not even try to fucking deal  with these people on a rational level they are just not they're not in this century they live in a  whole nother century where it's okay to just crack women across the face with sticks uh uh a chop 
[03:47:30]  people's heads off and hands or like that saudi case of the woman who was assaulted the woman who was  raped there's a woman who was raped in uh saudi arabia and uh they sentenced her to prison because  they saw they saw her as in she enticed them they saw her as uh enticing them they're a lovely culture  yeah a lovely fucking culture isn't it a lovely group hey let's go to keith in dc keith hey guys  how's it going welcome aboard hey i just wanted to say i'm tired of all these people calling my wife
