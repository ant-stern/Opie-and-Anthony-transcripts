<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, was overwhelmingly dominated by the Don Imus controversy following his racially charged comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team.  The hosts vehemently condemned Imus's firing from MSNBC, particularly its timing immediately before his annual radiothon for sick children.  They repeatedly used highly offensive racial slurs and derogatory language, primarily targeting Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, whom they blamed for orchestrating Imus's dismissal, accusing them of hypocrisy and MSNBC of cowardice.  This sentiment was echoed by guest Patrice O'Neal, who called in to express his agreement with the hosts’ views on the perceived double standard in applying freedom of speech based on race.  The show heavily featured audio clips of Jesse Jackson, highlighting perceived inconsistencies in his statements, and  Robert Johnson (founder of BET), analyzing his relatively muted response to criticism of African American portrayals in media.  The hosts also played a montage of people repeating the phrase "nappy-headed hoe," analyzing it within the context of the broader discussion about offensive language in media.  They repeatedly played clips of various media personalities’ reactions, including Keith Olbermann, whose perceived hypocrisy and need for black approval were heavily criticized, and Al Roker, whose condemnation of Imus's remarks while simultaneously criticizing rap music’s misogynistic and racist language were mocked for perceived inconsistencies.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to fundraising for Imus's radiothon. The hosts, referring to MSNBC as "vulture coward scumbags,"  actively encouraged listeners to donate, highlighting the negative impact of Imus’s firing on the fundraising efforts for sick children.  A caller shared a story of increased donations, largely attributed to Opie and Anthony listeners. A former program director, Mark Chernoff, who had left to work for Imus, sent an email detailing Imus's gratitude for their support and the positive impact on donations.  The hosts also discussed a caller recounting a coworker using racist language, reinforcing their argument about pervasive hypocrisy regarding offensive language.  Another caller detailed offensive language used on a different radio station, furthering their point.  The show included numerous caller interactions reflecting a wide range of opinions on the Imus situation, from support for Imus and criticism of Sharpton to concerns about offensive language in other media.

The broadcast also included a heated segment addressing Howard Stern's criticism of Opie and Anthony’s supposed 0.0 rating in Vegas, which Opie vehemently denied, recounting a profanity-laced phone call confronting Tim Sabean, a former friend now working for Stern, about the false claim.  Jim Norton promoted his upcoming HBO special.  The show featured several tangents, including a story about a chimpanzee, an anecdote about one of the hosts' girlfriend, and a lengthy discussion about caricatures of the hosts at The Palms restaurant, focusing on the size difference in their depictions.  The hosts also mentioned their upcoming comedy tour in Vegas, featuring Patrice O'Neal, Bobby Kelly, Frank Caliendo, and Joe Rogan.  The show concluded with a "line of the day" segment, followed by a final, nonsensical joke.  The broadcast consistently maintained a tone characterized by frequent use of offensive language and aggressive commentary on the Don Imus situation and the responses from various public figures.  Imus himself sent a message asking Opie and Anthony to stop their support as it was harming his cause, which was then discussed on-air.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What can I do with this?  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tonya, I'd like to apologize.  I would apologize.  Go away.  Woo-hoo-hoo! 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in.  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  I love Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water-drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Well, I guess we don't have to give out the phone number.  Nine.  Wow.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Who do you want to wake up this morning, Anthony?  Well, we usually wake up a group of people.  Everybody thinks it's just the same people that listen every morning.  Just regular Joe that goes off to work or something.  But we've woken up in the past, too. 
[00:02:00]  Serial killers.  Most of we've woken up in the past.  Amputees.  Amputees.  We had a lot of those.  That was cool.  Horny housewives.  Horny housewives.  Stepfathers.  And stepdaughters.  And stepdaughters.  Today, wake up, white people.  Wake up, white people.  It's time to wake up the white people.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  That's who we're waking up today.  And if you're going to work today, why don't you leave your white guilt at home for once?  Could you please?  One day, just leave it in the drawer.  I'm so tired of looking at it and hearing it.  The guilt.  I heard some of the most ludicrous crap I've ever heard broadcast on various news shows last night. 
[00:03:00]  MSNBC, CNN.  All these talking heads getting on there and talking about this Imish situation and saying things that I was yelling at the television.  I was yelling at the television.  It was ridiculous.  One gentleman was actually saying that this brought up the evils of slavery. 
[00:03:30]  And I'm like, you know, this situation brings up a lot of things.  A lot of discussion has come up over it.  And a lot of accusations and accusations of hypocrisy.  And just a lot of discussion.  But did Imish bring up something that's 200 and something years old?  No, that's a bit of guilt coming from the other side.  I heard more moronic statements last night on the news. 
[00:04:00]  Because now they're just dragging everybody into it.  Oh, yeah.  Anyone that wants to talk about this is coming up and dragging it in.  Every third, fourth, fifth-rate reverend is being dropped in a seat on a news program to open their yap and have just garbage spill out.  Were you watching the TV last night going, you know, I've got to finally admit it.  I don't live in the same country as these people. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what I mean by, you know, these people, I'm talking black and white.  Because I saw a lot of white people on the news going, you really feel that way?  What?  Where am I living?  Where am I living?  Is there anywhere else I can live?  No.  Where people think kind of like I do.  Where you should be able to say whatever the hell you want on the radio.  You should be able to put out whatever rap song you want.  Anything should go. 
[00:05:00]  Well, here's something I heard.  Why do we have to protect everybody?  Why do we all have to be equal in everyone's eyes?  And I'm not talking black and white.  I'm talking just in general.  Not even protect people from physical harm.  That's one thing.  People should be protected from physical harm.  Now we're in a state where you have to protect people from being hurt by words.  Do you remember that Jerky Boys bit?  It makes me laugh now thinking about it.  Where Saul Rosenberg was like he wanted to sue because he was injured. 
[00:05:30]  I was very injured.  Sure.  And the lawyer asked him, he goes, well, did he hurt you physically?  And he goes, no, he hurt me with his words.  And it was a scream.  It was hysterical because it was so ridiculous to think that some guy's calling a lawyer because his boss hurt him with his words.  Yeah.  He hurt me with his words.  And we are now living where that is a viable case that people can bring up against you is that you hurt them with your words. 
[00:06:00]  With stupid words.  Are you kidding me?  Oh.  Sticks and stones will break your bones, but names can get you thrown off the air and sued and made look to look ridiculous.  Well, we got this guy, Zev Shaffetz. 
[00:06:30]  He wrote a little column today in the New York Post.  Zev!  There's so many places we want to go today, but because you brought that up, let me just read the first paragraph or so.  Schoolyard thug.  Everyone knows an Imus.  Don Imus and Imus.  What, a crotchety old guy?  It's been a rotten week for Don Imus.  On Monday, he was suspended from his radio show.  On Tuesday, Procter & Gamble, blah, blah, blah.  Yesterday, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:07:00]  Also, they'll cancel their advertising.  Barack Obama called for him to be fired, and then he got canned by MSNBC, and it's only Thursday.  By the way, you will not hear me scream at Obama anymore on this radio show.  I think Obama's going to lose a lot.  Yeah, I cannot support any person for president that doesn't believe in freedom of speech and doesn't accept apologies and thinks it's okay for someone to lose a 40-year broadcasting career over a dumb throwaway line. 
[00:07:30]  Throwaway, that's what it's called in the biz.  Where there was no hate behind it.  I can't support a guy like that.  Pure humor.  And if the rest of the candidates support this as well, then guess what?  I will not vote once again until I see a candidate that I really, really can get behind.  But you're not going to hear me shouting Obama anymore, that's for sure.  It couldn't happen to a more deserving victim, he continues, and we all owe the Reverend Al Sharpton some thanks.  Do we?  I know Don Imus, and so do you. 
[00:08:00]  Everybody went to school with him.  There's an Imus in every class, a weird, nasty kid with a smart mouth.  By the way, as I was reading this, I was thinking this radio show.  Oh, I know.  Just plug in the names where you think they're appropriate from your favorite radio show.  Do you hear this faggot, though, working on his little childhood issue?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Oh, I know.  Please, you see his picture, too?  No.  His picture, he looks like a guy that probably got bullied around in school a lot.  Can I tell you something?  I got bullied around in school. 
[00:08:30]  Know what I did about it?  You didn't.  I made sure that I got smarter.  I made sure that I worked on comebacks and how to protect myself.  I lifted weights until I couldn't move.  That's what I did.  I didn't need to go run to some kind of legal prison.  Well, I didn't need to go to some leader and go,  please protect me.  Help me.  They're hurting me with their words.  I protect myself.  I don't need somebody.  And God, I hope the black people are listening today. 
[00:09:00]  You don't need a black leader to protect you.  You can do it yourselves.  Let me bring this up also quickly.  The majority of black people don't give a crap about this issue.  I kind of believe that, too.  I really do.  It's a very small minority of noisemakers, of squeaky wheels, of self-promoting douchebags  that have one agenda propelling themselves into the media's forefront.  They want to be in front of the cameras and the microphones. 
[00:09:30]  And that's who's making a big stink about this.  When they bring up, well, the reason Imus got fired from MSNBC is public outrage.  No, it's not public outrage.  Most people don't care.  Most black people are, honestly, you know, all jokes aside that we make here,  they're going to work.  They're living their lives.  They're doing what they do.  So there's this small minority that make a lot of noise and can make a lot of trouble for people. 
[00:10:00]  Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, who, by the way, both of them just talk about yelling at my TV.  When Jesse Jackson got on MSNBC last night, I couldn't understand a word he was saying.  But the words I did understand were pissing me off.  And just the fact that they were saying, well, this is just the beginning.  Now it's what they call a witch hunt.  Yeah.  You think every radio show out there.  I love these dopes that are sitting there saying this is a great thing. 
[00:10:30]  You're in broadcasting and you're saying this is fantastic.  Because one of these days you're going to say something that someone doesn't like.  And you're going to have no hate behind it.  No.  You're making up your radio show as you go along.  And you're going to say, wait.  Five hours and there's going to be a throwaway line and you go, oh, man, that kind of sucks.  I wish I didn't say that.  But it's going to be too late.  And an apology is not going to be accepted.  Apologies don't work anymore?  No, because you've got to be dragged down to a very low level to make other people feel really, really good about themselves. 
[00:11:00]  That's it.  You've got to be the whipping boy.  That's what Imus is right now.  So, Zev.  Zev.  There's an Imus in every class.  A weird, nasty kid with a smart mouth and an instinct for the emotional jugular.  If you stutter, he can imitate it.  Wear a new suit to the dance and he'll make sure everyone knows your mom bought it on sale at JCPenney.  What he means is a funny guy.  Yeah.  Funny guy.  The guy that...  And meanwhile, when he says that, everyone's laughing. 
[00:11:30]  Everyone's laughing at you.  Yeah.  Because you were the one that your mommy bought a JCPenney suit.  Zev is this little fat-faced douche that people would probably pick on and a funny guy like Imus would smash him verbally.  And he's just jealous he was never that guy.  He's a funny guy.  The guys like Imus were the ones that were quick-witted and got the girls and fat douchebags like that were left sitting in the corner being made fun of. 
[00:12:00]  Got bad skin?  Walked with a limp?  Afraid of heights?  Imus has a nickname just for you.  As he should.  Yeah.  You're with a bunch of kids in school.  They're going to make fun of you.  That was the fun.  It builds character, you ass.  Exactly.  You can call someone with all three of those things a limping, bad-faced basement dweller.  No offense to anybody in the community.  Right.  Basement-dwelling community.  Just like he had for the members of the Rutgers women's basketball team. 
[00:12:30]  The playground Imus always has a sidekick.  A big dummy who laughs at his insults and watches his back.  The radio Imus has Bernard McGurk, an on-air producer.  Usually-  He's a jerk.  I like to call him my jerk.  And producers in quotations.  No, he is a producer.  Zev.  What is Zev questioning?  He really is a producer.  He really is a producer.  Zev.  Zev's an idiot.  Maybe you don't think his tactics are producer-worthy, but he actually is the producer of the Imus radio show. 
[00:13:00]  Usually his job is to repeat whatever Imus says, but last week he ventured a thought of his own.  That's some rough girls from Rutgers, he said.  Man, they got tattoos.  In the world of Don Imus, Don Imus gets the last word.  That's some nabby-headed hoes here, he said.  Of course, Imus has made a career of ugly slurs, but this one rubbed Al Sharpton the wrong way.  And he raised a mighty howl for Imus's head.  And then it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.  Yeah, he goes off about more of his angst that he has from when he was beat up in the schoolyard. 
[00:13:30]  I can't tell you how much I hate Zev.  Zev's an idiot.  Zev really is an idiot.  And to praise Reverend Al Sharpton is just insanity.  This guy has made a career out of lying, out of supporting people based solely on race, whether they're right or wrong. 
[00:14:00]  I don't care.  Why is this Tawana Brawley thing brushed under the carpet with him?  Why is it an issue that if brought up in front of Reverend Al, he'll blow it off, he'll brush that aside like it was ancient history and shouldn't ever be brought up.  The guy lied through his teeth.  He supported a cause that was completely unjust.  He's a liar.  And now he's the second coming for black people? 
[00:14:30]  And he accused Steven Pagonis, I believe, one of the young prosecutors, of being involved in it and said he could sue us.  That was his response.  He could sue us.  Yeah.  Well, Reverend Al is known for being sued and never paying off on these lawsuits.  He just goes about his way.  How he makes his money, I don't know.  Has anyone ever looked into Reverend Al and how he gets his money?  I think it was looked into once when there was a grainy black and white video in a hotel room.  In a charity that there was allegedly misappropriation.  An alleged misappropriation at some charities. 
[00:15:00]  And this guy's leading the charge.  Dude, he's the hero.  I'm sitting there on my couch going, this is insane.  People are patting him on the back, not realizing this guy is just a self-serving douche.  Him and Jesse Jackson.  Jesse Jackson's another one.  Mr. Hymeetown, whenever people are bringing that up these days because of all this, he'll brush that aside like it never happened and change the subject immediately.  And we have a little audio of Jesse Jackson talking about this. 
[00:15:30]  The Duke lacrosse team.  The Duke lacrosse team.  And that woman that accused these young white men of raping her.  And that turned out to be a lie.  And Jesse Jackson supported this woman based on nothing but her race and the race of the men that were accused of sexually abusing her.  That's it because there were no facts.  There was no evidence.  There was nothing.  And this guy jumped on that bandwagon based on nothing but race. 
[00:16:00]  And Jesse certainly helped ruin these guys' lives.  Yeah.  So where's the accountability for that?  Because the...  Where's the accountability for that?  The prosecution and everyone else felt the pressure from these black groups led by people like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson who do nothing but base it completely on race and feel the pressure.  So they have to make a case against these guys for fear of letting them off during a grand jury hearing and then having your city explode. 
[00:16:30]  That's what the problem is.  Because if there was a little more credibility to your causes, people might get behind you more when you actually have a cause.  But when you're aligned with the Tawana-Brawley case and attorneys, fake lying attorneys like Mason and Maddox that were disbarred, when you're caught supporting people on nothing more than their race, you have no credibility. 
[00:17:00]  None with me, that's for sure.  And none with a lot of other white people.  You'd get a lot more...  You're getting...  See, they're getting disillusioned because they're getting these white, guilt, self-hating white people that are backing a lot of these black talking heads like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.  That is not the majority of white people.  I'll tell you what this is doing.  This is dividing whites and blacks even more.  The average Joe, that's the people I talk to.  I talk to a lot of people on a daily basis. 
[00:17:30]  And what I see is a bigger divide being made because of stuff like this.  Imus went out of his way to make sure, look, he's saying, I screwed up.  All right?  Give him credit for that.  I apologize.  I want to meet with these people.  I want to do everything.  What more could this guy have done to save his job after making a split-second error on his radio show?  That comment was made in nothing but jest, in comedy. 
[00:18:00]  Whether you think it's comedy or not, his intent was comedy.  And intent is everything in this case.  It was not hate speech.  It wasn't put out there to be hateful.  He had nothing personal against these girls on the team.  Yet he is being hung out to dry by guys that we had to forgive.  By guys that were forgiven for some reason for lying and for being separatists, for being racist, and supporting people based solely on the color of their skin, regardless of their innocence or guilt. 
[00:18:30]  I got the clip from Hannity and Combs.  An amazing clip.  Sean Hannity pulled out a clip from a year ago of Jesse Jackson.  Oh, he just showed this?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Yeah, Hannity was great last night.  Good job, Sean.  And honestly, Combs was pretty good last night as well.  Was he there?  Yeah, he was there.  He was actually pretty vocal last night.  He was terrific as well.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  Did Sean keep looking like, could you have this man removed?  Oh, it's not my co-host. 
[00:19:00]  Do I have a co-host?  Have him removed.  Oh, it's you.  Did they blow the dust off of his volume knob on his microphone last night and actually let him talk?  Yeah, the engineer was like, oh, my God, I think he's going to talk tonight.  I don't even know how to turn up this guy's volume.  Wait a minute.  He's got like 1950s radio equipment in front of him.  You hear, boo, before he talks.  The lighting guy in the studio is like, oh, my God, I think I've got to turn on another spotlight tonight.  What?  What, what, what, what?  Anyway, because the Duke lacrosse thing, it's perfect that these two stories collided yesterday because it just shows the hypocrisy. 
[00:19:30]  And Sean, you've got to point out the hypocrisy yourself, though, because it won't be pointed out in the media.  No, of course not.  You won't see any big leadership come forward to point out this hypocrisy.  Of course not.  You've got to, you've got to point it out yourself.  Yeah.  One thing that the cover of the post has the Duke liar and it's her stupid, big lying mugshot face.  And in the daily news, they said that they're not going to press charges.  The prosecutors are probably not going to go after her. 
[00:20:00]  It says AG won't go after troubled rape accuser.  Troubled.  She's troubled.  She's a troubled girl.  Yeah, well.  She's a lying whore is what she is.  She's a troubled girl.  A lying whore.  Are we allowed to say ho in this case?  No.  Or are we going to get fired?  No, you'll get fired.  And we're going to get fired for talking about...  And don't make it the phrase that pays.  Oh, God.  We'll get into that as well.  We'll get into that a little later.  We have a doozy of a show today.  So anyway, let me get this clip in.  So Sean Hannity pulls out a clip. 
[00:20:30]  And listen to me very carefully.  The clip you're about to hear is a year ago.  A year ago.  Jesse Jackson on Hannity and Combs talking about the Duke lacrosse case.  Based on nothing but the color of the accuser's skin.  And the color of the accused's skin.  Because at this point, there was no evidence that was available yet.  And obviously, there was no evidence because she was lying.  These guys were completely vindicated. 
[00:21:00]  But a year ago, when this first really started getting fired up, no evidence.  Jesse Jackson comes to her defense and offers her a scholarship.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This idiot.  Based on what?  If not the facts, what was he basing this on?  The fact that she's black and they were white.  Period.  Period.  And that's the setup.  So this clip, remember, is a year ago.  When this whole case broke.  Okay?  Don't strip.  Scholarship.  But in America, that's a nice line. 
[00:21:30]  In America, you're innocent until proven guilty.  My question to you is very specific.  You've offered her the scholarship.  What if it turns out this woman is lying about these boys?  Do you take back that scholarship offer?  Well, I really do not because the evidence so far by the prosecutor is that she, in fact, was harmed that night.  You can't cite one specific bit of evidence that indicts these boys that she pointed out.  You can't give this audience one piece of evidence because there is none. 
[00:22:00]  Give us one piece of evidence.  Well, that, that, that, there you go.  There's your leader.  There you go.  There he is.  That, that, there you go.  So, Jesse.  There you go.  By the way, Jesse, you have to now give this lying whore a scholarship.  He said, if it turns out, and boy, that Hannity, God damn.  God bless Hannity.  Some foresight there.  He said, if she's lying, and in fact is lying about this, will you still give her the scholarship?  And he said yes.  He said yes.  I want to see Jesse Jackson give this dumb, lying whore a scholarship. 
[00:22:30]  There you go.  Fork it over.  It's time to hire some, uh, some new black leaders.  You guys, man.  There you go.  Black people, you really need new leaders.  There's your leader.  You need new leaders.  Uh, because these two are jokes.  And black people don't realize, like, how other, how other black people reacted.  It wasn't, it was, it was like, uh, I was talking to Keith last night, and he was like,  yeah, Sharpton and those guys, man.  Most black people don't care.  They don't.  That's what we're hearing day after day.  They don't.  I'm like, did you hear what Snoop came out and said? 
[00:23:00]  And did you hear what Steve Harvey came out and said?  Did you hear what Whoopi came out?  All these high-profile black people did jump on the pylon, which is what it is.  He looked, and he couldn't, he's like, Snoop?  People couldn't believe that guys like that were coming out against him saying what he wanted  and said, yeah.  By the way, Snoop just, uh, pled no contest to, uh, gun charges and drug charges, and  he'll be, uh, not serving.  He got a suspended sentence.  A suspended sentence. 
[00:23:30]  He got a suspended sentence.  Why is he?  Uh, yet he's still free to do commercials.  I mean, they love this guy.  Yeah.  They keep, where is any leadership to say, what kind of image is he giving the children?  Because it's always about the goddamn children.  What kind of image is he putting across to the children that says, you can deal drugs,  you can, uh, have drugs on you, you can, uh, have illegal weapons on you, and, uh, uh,  be convicted of it.  Bo, plead no contest.  Uh, you're, you're pretty much saying, yeah, I did this. 
[00:24:00]  Where's that?  And yet, have a very successful career.  Where's the advertising boycott there?  Where's the boycott on Snoop Dogg?  You won't see it.  Where are the black leaders coming forward saying, this is bad for our young black men  to see this guy, uh, coming up in the world, uh, and, and making a huge success of himself,  getting offers for commercials, television, uh, mainstream, uh, products have Snoop endorsing  them.  AOL has Snoop Dogg, uh, on the commercials. 
[00:24:30]  And meanwhile, you don't see that as being harmful to the black youth that's being raised  that, that this is not the guy that you want to see as, um, uh, uh, a leader, as some kind  of a role model.  Uh, it's just, the hypocrisy is astounding.  And, and, and one throwaway line from a quote, shock jock.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  Are you kidding me?  The hypocrisy is just.  No one also, also no one noticed this.  It was in USA Today on Tuesday.  Um, they did, uh, criminals in the NFL and there were 41, uh, people in the NFL that were, 
[00:25:00]  uh, arrested 41 people in the NFL, 39 of which were black, 39 out of 41.  And, you know, these are again, people that, that should be looked up to that get endorsement  deals that, and where's the outrage that, that, you know, these people.  Where's the people to smack them in the face and go, don't you realize that our young black 
[00:25:30]  men are looking up to you and, and, and you're, you're blowing it.  It, it, it makes no sense.  It's white people.  White people do not hold blacks to the same standards.  No.  People at MSNBC.  Can we come back?  Can we at least just talk about MSNBC?  No problem.  We're heading in that direction.  Yeah.  We got to take a break, I guess.  Yeah.  Which is beyond amazing.  Uh, when we tell you, uh, uh, what cowards MSNBC is, if they have every right of whatever, 
[00:26:00]  we'll get into that after the break.  And then we got audio of, uh, the founder of BET.  I, I, I almost threw a brick through my TV last night.  I'm not even kidding.  I was so outraged.  Oh, by the way, it wouldn't be the first time I broke stuff around my own house.  You know, people think I do stuff, uh, on the show for show.  Uh, no, I do it in my, uh, my, my private, uh, life as well.  I get so outraged.  And, and Keith Olbermann.  Oh, we got so much to talk about.  Yeah.  Goody two shoes. 
[00:26:30]  Keith Olbermann.  Go screw.  Ooh.  It was fun hearing Ope drop certain words in the, uh, I never heard that in the office  before.  I was so happy.  Welcome aboard, Ope.  Welcome aboard.  Well, here's the deal.  I mean, I've said it on this program.  I, I truly believe every single person, I don't care what color you are.  You're a bit hypocritical and you're a bit racist.  I don't care who you are.  It just depends how, how, how racist you actually are.  And yesterday, uh, after all this coverage and stuff, I don't know.  I think I might've moved up a spot. 
[00:27:00]  I might've moved up just a little bit.  I gotta be honest with you.  It's dividing.  This isn't bringing together.  I've seen people talk about this, how it's, this is great.  It's bringing black and white people together because they want to defend, uh, against hate  speech in this.  No, it's really the majority of the people it's dividing.  Yeah.  It really is, uh, dividing, uh, uh, white and black people.  Yeah.  Well, we got to take a break.  Listen, I want to play this going into break because we really try to be, uh, on top of  everything.  So here's the latest on IMAS and then we'll discuss after the break. 
[00:27:30]  Okay.  Just in case you don't know.  Too weak and not in love.  Too weak and not in love.  Too weak and not in love.  Hundreds of students and faculty members rallied at Rutgers University yesterday.  They're not only calling for CBS to fire IMAS.  They also want a change in what radio hosts can and cannot say.  One CBS board member says IMAS abused his media powers.  The power of the media has to match responsibility with that power. 
[00:28:00]  I think that Don IMAS, in this particular case, has abused his power and there needs to be a  consequence as a result.  MSNBC denies its decision to fire IMAS has anything to do with the recent loss of advertisers.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202. 
[00:28:30]  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  So, yeah, the news people are waking up to today.  IMAS was fired from MSNBC.  Disgusting, revolting MSNBC. 
[00:29:00]  What a bunch of cowards.  What a bunch of douchebags.  What a bunch of poo-hahs.  And people that can't see the big picture.  That's for sure.  Let me tell you the thing right off the bat.  MSNBC has every right to cancel the IMAS show.  Absolutely.  But the way they did it, knowing that today and tomorrow, Mr. IMAS is raising money for sick kids.  Yep.  Which he does every year.  Which he's been doing for 18 years.  It's his radiothon, okay? 
[00:29:30]  Here's the deal.  They could have waited until Monday.  They could have even said something like, you know, we might be doing, I don't know, however you do that.  But they could have waited because by taking IMAS off MSNBC, they have just pretty much made sure that the donations are going to be way, way down this year.  Yeah, donations are going to be down.  And sick kids are going to be suffering.  Sick kids are going to be suffering.  Because you're a bunch of cowards.  This isn't words.  This isn't people being hurt, hurt by words. 
[00:30:00]  This is actually children now being affected.  Sick children physically being affected because finances won't be coming in because you took him off the air and couldn't wait two days during his radiothon.  It's despicable that they would even think of doing that, to buckle under the pressure of a few self-serving news whores that you would then take IMAS off the air during a charity event for children. 
[00:30:30]  What hurts more?  People being called a name or children not getting funding for diseases.  Yeah.  You insensitive schmucks.  It's not like there's radiothons.  I may use a Yiddish word.  Yeah.  It's not like there's radiothons all over the radio dial and all over TV.  Yeah.  This is kind of a really important thing that is done every year.  And they basically didn't even want to acknowledge that. 
[00:31:00]  Like, yeah, whatever.  It's just sick kids anyway who gives a crap, right?  Do we have the number if you want to donate?  Yeah, of course.  That'll help out the cause and IMAS and stuff.  Yeah, please call the number if you have a few extra bucks laying around.  Yeah, make a little donation.  And say, you know, this is for IMAS and this is, you know, and I'm an Opie and Anthony fan.  Let's make sure they know where it's coming from.  It's the WFAN Radiothon to benefit the IMAS Ranch, the Tomorrow's Children's Fund, and the CJ Foundation for SIDS.  Donations online at WFAN.com. 
[00:31:30]  Just click the Radiothon banner.  It's right there for everybody.  Or you could call 877-877-6464.  Very easy number to remember.  877-877-6464.  You could use Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover Card.  They really need the help because MSNBC just, I guess, I see it this way.  They don't believe in sick kids.  They're great causes, and this is something IMAS has done for years.  This is the kind of guy he is. 
[00:32:00]  You know, with the comedy that he does on the air, yeah, it's cutting.  He has goofed on religion and race and sexuality and everything over the years.  That's just what he does, and it's all been done in comedy.  But this is the guy he is.  He's a very charitable man, and he's doing this Radiothon like he does every year.  And for MSNBC to pull him on the day he is to do this Radiothon is despicable. 
[00:32:30]  They're pigs.  Just despicable.  And we want to help out because they're going to lose donations because he's not on MSNBC.  So if our listeners can help out, call that number, go to the website, and donate some money.  WFAN.com and the phone number, 877-877-6464.  And we reach a lot of people.  We have a voice as well.  And I plead to our listeners, and some people will write about this and laugh and go, 
[00:33:00]  Opie and Anthony are attempting to boycott.  You know, they only talk to just a bunch of losers.  No, we don't.  We know for a fact we don't.  We know for a fact we talk to a bunch of very influential people out there.  The losers are just the ones that show up at the live appearances.  Yeah, well, that's true.  We've got to work on that.  I highly, highly, highly recommend that you boycott MSNBC.  Don't give them the time.  Don't give them the time whatsoever. 
[00:33:30]  Bunch of cowards.  Yeah.  Their timing stinks.  Good work.  I mean, if you wanted to – it's their decision if they wanted to get rid of them.  But your timing, man, you know, I mean, you couldn't wait until his suspension started.  Or even he's suspended.  So you wait the two weeks, and then you test the waters then and see if things have blown over, see if –  But they're so holier than thou – the president of NBC News Division came out and just babbled this white guilt about how internally a lot of people at NBC were clamoring for Imus' firing from MSNBC. 
[00:34:00]  Including Keith Overman.  He couldn't wait to tell his audience that he was behind this and needed to say something, but they told him, just don't say anything until we make our decision.  And Al Roker, his name was brought up.  This guy finally makes a stand, and it's one of the easiest non-controversial stands to make. 
[00:34:30]  It's ridiculous that this guy is giving any credibility.  All of a sudden, Al, you want to be poignant?  What's the matter, a whole career of hanging around with just goody-two-shoe white people, standing there with an umbrella?  What's the matter?  That wasn't racially satisfying for you?  Now you want to take a stand?  By the way, dressing up in a funny little costume and doing a little dance in front of your co-hosts finally got to you?  Here's a –  Jackass.  Here's a stapled belly.  Here's Steve Kappas on Keith Overman's show last night on MSNBC. 
[00:35:00]  Those voices within NBC were louder than anything else.  Yes, and we place a tremendous value on the integrity of this organization.  At the end of the day, we have nothing but our reputation.  Well, when you've got nothing.  And if you sacrifice that, then what have you gained?  What's the purpose of going on if you've sacrificed your reputation along the way?  This is not a financial decision.  The good financial decision would have been to leave him on. 
[00:35:30]  Then cough up the money for the sick kids.  You know that.  You see the ratings reports as well as I do.  And this program has been doing very well from a business point of view.  But when you – when I sit across from employees of my own division and they say to me, Steve, this could have been my daughter.  Oh, boy.  How can I ignore that?  What?  How could you ignore it?  Oh, boy.  By looking at it in the spirit it was given. 
[00:36:00]  He wasn't insulting any individual.  He wasn't – this is – it was a throwaway line based in comedy.  You jackass.  People are losing their minds.  Dude, I've heard –  They're losing their minds.  I've heard more.  I've heard more.  Yeah, I'm totally losing their minds.  Sister – this could have been – oh, sisters and mothers and grandmothers.  Hey, what do you say?  This could have been my daughter.  How do I respond to that?  How about – well, tell that bitch to study and stop throwing a ball for a hoop and it won't be your daughter.  Stupid. 
[00:36:30]  By the way, that's a joke from Jim Dorn.  Yes.  Now we've got to make sure everyone is perfectly clear that we're trying to make jokes.  Oh, please.  I don't need someone to go on a news show and go, I didn't even know they were comedians.  I didn't know.  Yeah, because I have heard some people say that the reason I should be fired is because he made that statement  and because his show has so many politicians on it that it is looked at as a news-type show,  and that's why he should be fired.  If it was a comedy show, it wouldn't have the impact.  So what's going to happen when they come to attack us? 
[00:37:00]  What's going to be their excuse?  Because this is a pure comedy show.  Whether you think it's comedy or not.  Some days we leave thinking it's not comedy.  And I was walking around my aboods trivel yesterday night going, I have no doubt in my mind we're next.  Who knows when.  It could be a month from now.  It could be a year from now.  It could be tomorrow.  But I have no doubt.  Maybe not next in line.  There'll be maybe a couple more people.  But we're in line.  We're not stupid enough to do the phrase that pays.  We'll get into that story in a little while.  But he talks about the integrity of the news department. 
[00:37:30]  And if we don't have that at the end of the day, what do we have?  Well, what clip do you want to play that shows the integrity of NBC News?  Let's showcase some of the integrity of NBC News.  Do you want the news clip where they report on Diet Coke and Mentos?  All right, let's do that.  Do you want Borat visiting the Today Show?  Do you want an interview where they interview the best jugglers in the world?  Let's get some of that integrity. 
[00:38:00]  Or do you want the report on a fan that made Star Trek episodes?  Or do you want just a cute piece on goofy Halloween costumes?  There's your integrity.  I like goofy Halloween costumes.  Unfortunately, one of the best ones about integrity was a visual thing that we watched the video of inside.  But it was during a flood in Jersey.  And one of the newswomen was in a canoe.  And she's paddling going, I'm in the streets in a canoe because of the flooding. 
[00:38:30]  And as she's paddling.  This was NBC, right?  Oh, yeah.  As she's paddling, two guys with galoshes on go stomping across in front of her shot in what amounted to six inches of water.  Yeah.  She was in six inches of water.  But to over-dramatize this flood, because this was on the tale of Katrina.  So they wanted to kind of localize the story and make it like Jersey was flooding.  So she got in a canoe and did this report.  There's your integrity.  You got no water underneath your stupid canoe. 
[00:39:00]  And men are walking in the puddle you're in.  You're in a puddle.  Do we have that on audio?  The audio doesn't really.  Yeah.  I'm looking at it.  It's on YouTube.  It is hysterical.  Here it is.  Michelle, do you want our listeners to spell?  Look at that.  There it is.  That was a live shot, too.  There's your integrity.  There's your integrity, NBC.  Sensationalism at its best.  She wanted the shot to look at our people to go, oh, my God, she needs a boat.  And we could spend all morning showing you their integrity in the news department. 
[00:39:30]  At the end of the day, if you don't have integrity, what do you have?  Some bitch in six inches of water in a canoe, stupid.  With two guys in galoshes stomping in front of her.  Oh, I hope they worked for CBS.  There's your integrity.  So shut up about your integrity.  Integrity, my ass.  And we got, I don't know, a bunch of examples.  But integrity can be important.  Why would you want to leave them on for two days and help the sick children with cancer?  Or better Al Roker can feel like he finally made a difference racially. 
[00:40:00]  Because I guess he's had to look in the mirror all these years and realize,  I'm a fat man with an umbrella.  I'm a millionaire, and I'm doing nothing to help other black people.  And a little announcement to the white columnists out there.  Don't be so scared.  Write about it.  No, they're all running scared.  Everyone is running scared that's in the public eye.  You have got a situation brewing here where this is going to turn into a witch hunt.  And the word police, which right now is the black leadership, leadership, and I use that 
[00:40:30]  term loosely, and black extremists that follow these leaders, that is now the word police.  But this will spread.  Once other groups see that this works in the way it does, you'll see gay groups and Asians.  Asians have already started like that.  And Italians have kind of gone on the thing where they don't want to see any mafia things tied to it.  But you can pretty much still do these things. 
[00:41:00]  You'll get some crap.  But once they see now that they're drawing blood, we're not going to be able to discuss anything.  I just don't live in the same place.  On the radio.  I just don't.  Last night I'm hearing it's not acceptable to say the B word, the F word, the N word.  I heard more initials on the air last night, more just letters being used in place of words than I ever have.  It's an insane, twisted world country that we're living in in this day and age. 
[00:41:30]  Patrice O'Neill is chomping at the bit.  We're going to get him on after the break.  Also, once again, just a douche move by MSNBC.  They have every right to take IMAS off.  And like I said yesterday, I knew it was coming.  It was so obvious.  I hope you predicted that one.  And I beg.  You said by Friday.  Yeah.  By thinking that they might actually stick it out until after the radio thump.  That's what I was thinking.  I'm like, there's no doubt in my mind that MSNBC has to get rid of them because it is different over there because they are based, quote, and I use it in quotation, on telling us the news. 
[00:42:00]  You know, CBS radio, we have a little more leeway because we're not like a serious news program.  And that's what my thinking was.  But then I'm thinking, all right, they'll let him finish out the week because he's got this radio thump he's been doing for 18 years.  No.  No one is a scumbag to the point where they'll yank a guy right before his radio thump where he's raising money for sick kids.  Who's going to write about that tomorrow?  I'm going to be reading every single newspaper in America. 
[00:42:30]  Who's brave enough to write about that?  Come on.  And say how much of a dick move that is.  By the way, I was talking to someone from Imus' camp last night late, Mark.  And he goes, it's going to be really uncomfortable today.  This is a fact.  Imus is at MSNBC doing his radio show today.  He's got to do the show from that studio.  And he's doing his radio thump around these people that pretty much have acknowledged that they don't want anything to do with him.  He's over there right now.  Can you imagine that? 
[00:43:00]  Can you imagine that?  So anyway, once again, the Imus radio thump that he's been doing for 18 years, I guess everyone decided they didn't want to acknowledge on the news last night.  It benefits the Imus Ranch, the Tomorrow's Children's Fund.  And for the black people out there, he's helping sick black kids as well, okay?  Yeah.  This isn't a white thing.  All right?  It's a race thing, dude.  I understand.  It is.  But believe it or not, he's helping sick black kids, you know, because you just think he's an outright racist. 
[00:43:30]  Racist.  Radiothon benefits the Imus Ranch, the Tomorrow's Children's Fund, and the CJ Foundation for SIDS.  Donations online at WFAN.com.  Just click the Radiothon banner, or you can give them a call.  The number's very easy.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you.  Yeah, we just want our listeners to just whatever you can give, really, step up and donate to help out.  And if you know a little bit about us, we usually don't go down this road.  No, we never do.  We make fun of these things.  Yeah, but something has hit a nerve with us this week. 
[00:44:00]  And to the people like us, shut up and go back to doing your regular show, no, deal with it.  Or go find something else to listen to.  So, this hits very close to home.  Very close to home.  And we will be next.  We'll say something dumb.  And now that they've got a little more power, it'll be a lot easier to get us kicked off next.  I'll tell you one thing.  No one's getting an apology.  That's for sure.  Once you see how little that does.  Yeah.  I'm sure whatever you said will be...  No reason to apologize.  No one will be able to apologize. 
[00:44:30]  You said the same word 40 times in a row.  It slipped.  That's the good thing.  When we screw up, there's no apologizing for it.  No, we actually apologize to our God in Munich.  Why did I say that?  Yeah.  Not only did you say it 40 times in a row, you would have said it 100 times in a row, but  we had to have armed guards pull you off the air.  The only people we have to apologize to are our families.  They'll feel like the scourge.  And I barely apologize to them.  You've got to walk around like Hitler's son or something where it's like, all right, I  know he did bad things. 
[00:45:00]  Ted Hitler.  Ted Hitler.  I'm just...  I can't control who my dad was.  He's a toaster repairman somewhere.  Let me repair the toasters.  All right, here we go.  So the phone number for the Radiothon, very easy.  Tell them Opian Anthony sent you 877-877-6464 and they accept credit cards.  Okay, Patrice O'Neill after the break.  Some amazing audio from the founder of BET.  They try to go after him a little bit about the rap videos and stuff and oh boy. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he didn't want to commit to that whatsoever.  Why would he?  All right, it's Opian Anthony.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opian Anthony Show.  Let's say hi to Charles in Massachusetts.  Charles, what's going on today?  How you doing?  All right, Charles.  I think it's disgusting what this reverend's doing.  He's a disgrace to the black race, if you ask me. 
[00:46:00]  And this Obama, he's very unprofessional, running for a president.  And he's going to try to jump on the damn bandwagon and try to get the black vote.  The problem with Obama is his lips are the color of someone who is frozen to death.  And I don't trust any man who looks like he's frozen to death.  It's a lynching.  This is supposed to be America.  What, do we live in Russia now where you can't say what you want?  Why did Obama have to jump on this one?  I don't get that.  Now we can start smashing him this week and all the inconsistencies in his statements. 
[00:46:30]  There's the frozen to death person.  All right.  Hey, Charles, just because it matters today, you're a black guy and you're saying Reverend  Al's a disgrace to your race?  Of course he is.  All right.  Thank you, Charles.  Thank you.  Thanks for listening.  We got Patrice O'Neill on the phone.  Serious, finally.  Just gracious.  How you doing, Patrice?  Hey, Patrice.  I'm doing lousy.  I'm sad.  I'm mad.  You really made me laugh on the phone yesterday when you called me.  You were very funny yesterday.  I'm confused. 
[00:47:00]  You black folks, I'm so disappointed that we chomped at this nappy-headed hoe.  Black people, especially comics, we are the beneficiary of language.  We own language right now.  It's almost a reparation.  We can say anything we want.  And for this banana in the tailpipe where so many of us live contradictory lives to the  fact that we're asking to get Don Imus, who I can care less about, to be fired. 
[00:47:30]  It's the fact that to say what you want to say, here's the only way we're going to rescue  our ownership of language, is if we finally come out and tell the truth that what we want  is double standard.  We want that.  We want to be able to say what we want to say, and white people can't say what they  want to say.  Right.  At least just be honest.  At least be honest.  Because how can Snoop say what he said? 
[00:48:00]  Yep.  How?  Yeah, what was the statement by Snoop?  He says, don't you dare bring rap lyrics into this discussion?  He compared, he compared, he tried to rationalize why we say hoe different.  And they don't understand the game.  What he does, that's what disappoints me.  He's been around the world.  When you travel the world, man, you have a different perspective of life.  And what I'm mad at is black people that know the game aren't teaching black people that 
[00:48:30]  don't know the game how to chill because we're fighting over nappy-headed hoe.  And what it is, in 72 hours, it turned from Don Imus to hip-hop.  Yeah.  And I hear you guys rising up.  We're rising up, Patrice.  You're right.  We have been riled up all week.  And we want to make it perfectly clear.  Imus should be able to say nappy-headed hoe.  And black artists should put out whatever rap song they want. 
[00:49:00]  I don't care.  Thank you.  That's why I said on Hannity and Combs, say what you want to say.  Because I see what's going to happen.  Do you think white people are going to stand back and just have not and say, here, black  people, have a privilege that we don't?  Patrice is absolutely right.  Because now we're going to turn around the microscope on the black community and look  at what black radio people are doing, what black rap artists are doing, and call you 
[00:49:30]  guys out on every single thing you say that seems racist.  And the only thing to protect that right now, because I see it coming.  Is just to stand on a platform and say, we want to say what you can't.  So, is it okay for Imus?  Wait, is it okay for Jay-Z to say hoe and nigger and not Imus?  Yes.  Yes.  You can't say it.  Why?  Because you're white. 
[00:50:00]  And then what would we be able to say?  We'd just be like, oh, okay.  Then you can't bring up the contradictions like, you know, Jesse Jackson, you said oogly-boogly  last year.  It's like, so what?  I'm black.  And the other thing, you know how twisted the white man works?  We now know that nappy-headed hoe could get to you.  Who knew?  Who knew?  We're fighting over nappy-headed hoe?  Who's going to?  I get all headed in cones. 
[00:50:30]  I might as well build my Uncle Tom cabin back down the street.  You sell out, you puppets.  You are a hand of these puppets.  You effing dummy.  I'm trying to help you, stupid.  I'm trying to help you.  I'm trying to help you.  I'm trying to help you.  I'm trying to help you.  I'm trying to help you.  I can talk about everybody.  Chinese people.  Gay people.  Poor, rich.  Indians.  White people with impunity.  Yep.  And they want to take it away from me for nappy-headed hoe. 
[00:51:00]  They're going to ruin it.  I am sacrificing.  I am willing to sacrifice the Rutgers basketball team so I can keep saying hoe, nigger, cracker.  Oh, yeah.  He's right.  Hey, Whitey's going after Chris Rock, man.  There you go.  We're going after Chris Rock the next time he says I'm stupid.  I'm saying black people.  We don't even stop talking.  Even anybody who makes a living talking, say this. 
[00:51:30]  You know what?  Anybody who makes a living talking.  It kind of shows a weakness, too, in my opinion.  Steve Harvey, Whoopi Goldberg, Snoop.  How?  How?  Where is nappy-headed hoe?  Please, just do me a favor.  Black people, tell me the plan.  Are we going after them one at a time?  One down?  A hundred and sixty million?  A hundred and sixty million?  What is wrong with us? 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  I was really confused last time.  Like, this is really going on around me?  Oh, my God.  It's a setup.  They couldn't.  Oh, God.  And it's being led by Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?  Are you kidding me?  And it's like, let me tell you, I'm not going to lie to you, dude.  It frightens me to say anything foul about either one of those dudes, because when somebody  misplaces a plunger or 41 bullets in my chest, those dudes come running. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, they have actually been on the right side of a lot of cases.  Obviously, not in the Amadou Diallo thing, who was just being naughty and got what had come  to him, but in a lot of other cases.  By the way, that was a joke, because, you know, people are monitoring us today.  Jimmy was attempting humor there.  I hope it's okay still.  Norton, I'm outraged that you would say that?  Yeah.  This is what I'm saying, man.  I don't understand this, and it's just, when you got chomping at the bit, when you guys 
[00:53:00]  said what you said, man, I appreciate you letting me call in, but I got so many emails  from dummies, and I don't even know how to type, so I really was just answering back,  shut up.  Because I didn't know how to type.  The long...  Somebody wrote to me on MySpace, I hope your grandparents are resting in peace.  You mother...  Like, you dummy, don't you see that we own it?  I own language. 
[00:53:30]  You got to...  Wait, you got to figure out how to say things.  Yeah.  Got to work your way around it.  I'm a cracker.  Anyone that has heard you on our show knows you own language.  That's for sure.  Patrice and other black comics can say whatever they want, yeah, and they don't get called  out on it.  But now, it's going to have to be, you know, one of these tit-for-tat things where...  Thank you, Anthony.  Wait a minute.  And one more thing.  Yeah.  White people don't say nigger.  So if...  Listen to me.  And what I'm thinking about that is if they outlaw or make all these words that's being 
[00:54:00]  controversial now, and they say you can't say them, you're going to get fined, you're  going to go to jail, whatever, who's going to suffer?  White people don't say nappy head at home ever.  We've never...  You know something?  Listen, I've never heard it said so much until the news had picked it up.  We got a montage that is hysterical.  It gets funnier the longer it goes, because I've never heard the nappy-headed hoe used  so much by this many people in such a short amount of time. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, you guys gave us an easy way out.  I mean, saying the N-word is like, you're really...  You have to reach really deep to get to that point, but to just have to say nappy now?  Oh, that's easy.  That's an easy one.  Pretty much anyone can do that.  And they have been.  When Kramer said, nigga, you go, okay, they got to do that, but still, I looked at it  from the side of a comic, of a man, of a, you know, the mistakes you could make, the  fact that I'm a comic, and you just, as you're reaching for something to be funny, you could  say something foul, and you go, oops, I tried. 
[00:55:00]  And now, nappy-headed hoe is our outcry.  I'm raising my black fist with a glove on it.  So, nappy-headed hoe, because somebody is pretending that their feelings are hurt?  You're going to go down because of nappy-headed hoe?  I don't understand.  I don't either.  And now everybody's going, and I quote, nappy-headed hoe.  Well, speaking of that, why don't we play the montage, Joe?  Listen to this.  We did this a couple days ago, but now we have a longer version of the montage. 
[00:55:30]  More gets added every day.  Yeah, listen to this, Patrice.  That's a nappy-headed hoe.  A nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  A nappy-headed hoe. 
[00:56:00]  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Boner-nosed, beanie-wearing Jew boy.  We're losing our minds over words in America. 
[00:56:30]  You probably could have gone long.  That was longer than a popular snail.  You do, or whatever.  Yeah.  And, dude, I'm so mad that we have, the only way to save it, man, I'm just trying, black  people listen, the only way we can save it is admit that we want a double standard.  Maybe we can make a deal with America that we can have language like this, and you can't.  Maybe that'll be reparations.  Maybe. 
[00:57:00]  Maybe.  Reparations with words.  What I realize in this whole racism thing is white guilt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I learned about white guilt from Patrice and Jimmy and Anthony.  You know, these guys have educated me on the whole white guilt thing.  I see it.  I see it now.  Clear as day.  I've only heard of it.  Patrice, could you imagine 50 years ago or so, a black man being told that in the future,  in the year 2007, with all the racism you're getting now, this is 50 years ago, I'm talking 
[00:57:30]  fire hoses and German shepherds, being told, do you know that in 50 years, the worst thing  that could happen is some old white guy is going to say nappy-headed hoe, and he is going  to be called out on the carpet as if he whipped somebody and lynched somebody, and it's going  to be the same anger.  There would be people going, oh my God, are you kidding?  That's in our future?  Thank God. 
[00:58:00]  You mean we finally won?  We lost it all for nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  People died.  I was born in 1969, dude, and let me tell you, in 87, start being a man, I have been  able to say what I want for 20 years, and I forget somebody sometimes got hosed up, died,  whatever, and we're getting soft, and we're getting crazy.  If we think that language is our God-given right, we fought for something that we actually 
[00:58:30]  can actually control, and now it's on, and it's led by the pest, and it's led by John  Gibson, what about Jay-Z?  And then when they ask that, it's like, well, just say, what about him?  He's black.  He can have it.  At least Patrice is being honest.  Of course.  You know what, and we've got to make everyone understand here, we're all for everything. 
[00:59:00]  I'll say it again.  Everybody say everything.  Absolutely.  That's where the black people and the white people, we have to come together and understand  that that's what this is all about.  You should be able to sing your rap songs.  We should be able to say whatever the hell we want on a radio show.  And for the people out there that think the FCC's going to do something about nappy-headed hoe,  oh boy, are you going to be disappointed.  I hope so.  Are you going to be disappointed?  I sure hope so.  I have all the confidence in the world that this is not an FCC issue. 
[00:59:30]  Last time I read the regulations, this is not an FCC issue.  Yeah.  Well, fellas, thanks for letting me call in, because I know I'm a living contradiction,  and I'm not telling anybody not to say nothing, you know?  Everybody say what you want to say.  I'm bigger than words, man.  I'm better than words.  It's got to stop.  But anyway, thanks for letting me call.  Hey, Patrice, what time do you get into Vegas tomorrow?  Shut up.  All right, Patrice, thank you.  Is he out of there?  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  All right, Patrice.  Let's not forget the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  We fly tomorrow to Vegas.  We're doing our radio show, and then we're flying.  And then the first date of the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show happens Saturday at the – oh, my God.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Help me out here.  The joint.  Yeah.  I don't know if tickets are available or not.  I'm not sure.  Try ticketmaster.com.  The problem with Vegas is a lot of people buy once they get to Vegas.  If you're going to be in Vegas, just check and see if there's anything available for Saturday night.  But we've got eight or nine comedians, and then we're going to have the press conference by the pool in the early afternoon. 
[01:00:30]  We encourage the past to show up at the pool, and we're going to announce the rest of the tour dates.  We're doing about ten cities this summer, okay?  So myself, Patrice O'Neal, Bobby Kelly, Frank Caliendo.  Rogan is finally on one.  We have a great lineup, man.  Yeah, I'm not sure of the Vegas lineup.  I know it's really, really strong, and you can get all the info on our website and go to ticketmaster.com for tickets, okay?  Otto and George, Ralphie May.  Yeah, and the Vegas station is helping us out big time.  Big time.  Oh, we're doing a 0.0, that Vegas station? 
[01:01:00]  Hey, you know what?  Oh, man, yeah.  Why don't we get into that next?  Yeah.  Because there's someone else we need to beat up today, and his name is Howard Stern.  We'll change gears a little bit for a little bit.  Oh, Tom just rolled his eyes in his office, locked the doors.  Tom, stay away.  We understand the tough position you're in, okay?  But it's deserved today.  We got to beat up Howard Stern.  We'll do it next.  Off the air, let's say racist things to each other.  All right.  We got a couple more minutes.  Speaking of the nappy-headed hoe thing. 
[01:01:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  No, I just love Opie's reaction.  Oh.  No, I'm just saying.  What do you have to ask?  I might as well say, all right, when we're off the air, let's breathe and use our hearts to pump blood to a vein.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, uh.  I see you're trolling.  You're trolling.  Uh, let's say hi to Greg in Baltimore.  Greg, what's up?  Greg.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Good evening.  Hey, I, uh, called up and donated a little bit of money. 
[01:02:00]  And the guy, uh, his name was Kevin.  He wanted me to tell you guys thank you because he's an ONA fan.  And, uh, he said that the last seven out of, uh, last five out of the seven callers that called said they called because they heard it on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, if you're donating money to the Radiothon, I, I mean, it's, I swear to God it's not self-righteous.  We just want to show, uh, Imus, you know, that we're really, really helping him out and behind him.  He's doing his Radiothon today and tomorrow.  He usually raises about $3 million. 
[01:02:30]  And with MSNBC, like, uh, taking his, uh, simulcast off, uh, hours before the Radiothon, it shows what kind of people they truly are.  MSNBC.  They could have waited till Monday.  This is for sick kids with cancer.  It's like, did they just vulture coward scumbags?  I can't think of any more adjectives.  That's what they are.  Yeah.  And besides that, Imus had to go over there and see all those people to raise money for sick kids.  It's just a scumbag move by MSNBC. 
[01:03:00]  No way around it.  The number to donate, I think, is 877-877-6464.  877 is repeated.  Uh, 877, is that correct?  Yeah.  877-877-6464.  And you could go to WFAN.com and click on the, hold on, bro, please.  Sweetie, angel, doll, we love you.  I've lost my voice.  It's a, you know, I mean, help us out a little bit today.  Thanks, sir.  You could also go to WFAN.com.  There's a Radiothon banner there.  It's basically helping sick kids.  Imus is doing this, has been doing this for 18 years. 
[01:03:30]  And MSNBC, just a scumbag move.  He's not on TV, so his exposure is drastically reduced.  And he could use the help in raising money.  Just make sure you tell him, Opie and Anthony, I'm donating for Opie and Anthony.  All right?  Uh, what else, Greg?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, man, I don't have a lot of money.  I only donated $20, but I figured if everybody helped out, chipped in $5, $10, man, it would  help out a lot.  Yeah, dude, if, you know, if 10,000 people call it with $20, that's a lot of money, man.  Anything, really. 
[01:04:00]  It doesn't matter how little you give.  Just, you know, it makes up for the fact that MSNBC yanked them.  You know, if it helps out a little bit, that's fine.  Why were they scared to mention that in the papers today?  I read all three New York papers.  Why?  Why didn't somebody write about that?  Because Whitey, the Whitey journalists are just running scared.  They're all scared, petrified of writing something.  Why do we have to point out the obvious angles on all this stuff?  I don't know.  And no one else sees what a scumbag move it is to take him off the TV hours before he 
[01:04:30]  does a radiothon to raise money for sick kids?  Regardless if you think those words that he said hurt that basketball team, and now, it  started out the basketball team, now apparently it's hurt every single black woman on the planet.  That's what they've blown that into.  Mark Kelly hasn't, but he has.  Yeah, yeah, but he has.  So, the words have hurt people, so your response is to hurt the ability for young, sick children  to maybe have a little bit of a better life through the money that Imus would raise if 
[01:05:00]  he had the exposure that he did with MSNBC.  And by the way, also, there's been some confusion in the press, like, why didn't CBS start the  suspension right away?  The reason, because they knew about this radiothon.  Yeah, this is an important thing that he does for years.  This isn't some kind of publicity stunt, either, that was planned because he did this, and  he's trying to make up.  This is something he's done for years.  It was in the planning already.  And look, we work for the same company, and I don't have much confidence in this, but I 
[01:05:30]  beg, I beg CBS to hang in there.  Yeah, just stick it out.  Hang in there, please.  Stick it out with the guy.  I mean, he's given you years of loyal service and brought in a lot of money for the company.  And I think during the trade-off that corporations have to understand is when you're a loyal employee  that has brought in tons of money for a company, the trade-off is sometimes you've got to stand  up for that person during the tough times. 
[01:06:00]  And this is one of those times where now you've got to look back at what Imus has done and  accomplished for the company, and as a human being, and say, all right, we're going to  have to stick it out through this tough time just because of what he's done for our company  for the past few years that he's been on.  A lot of years.  I don't have a lot of confidence.  I don't either, because that makes too much goddamn sense.  I don't really see it working out well for Imus, but I'm pleading and hoping that CBS  has the balls to try to hang in there. 
[01:06:30]  What is MSNBC even showing?  What are they showing this morning?  Who gives a crap?  Boy, cut that crap.  Gotta be awful.  Whatever.  Keith Olbermann.  Oh, he's a douchebag.  Oh, we'll be paying attention to him in the coming months.  Trust me on that.  They're doing an Imus off-the-air special.  Like, why not just play him?  Are you kidding me?  That's what they're running?  Let me tell you why they're running.  They're a bunch of scumbags because they talk about integrity and all.  Real integrity is showing anything but Imus. 
[01:07:00]  But what are you doing?  You're using Imus to get bigger ratings for your news channel.  That blows, by the way.  Yeah.  Where's the integrity?  Are you kidding me?  You're taking advantage of him as well.  If you're going to put him on there anyway, why not put on his charity event?  Or if you're going to talk about integrity, the president of NBC was on last night talking  about news integrity.  That's not integrity.  You make believe he doesn't exist at this point.  You're using him to get people to watch him.  But you know it's all about Imus right now. 
[01:07:30]  And you talk about Imus on your channel, you're going to get the ratings up a bit.  Screw integrity.  You don't have integrity.  By the way, before we go to break, Nappy Head at Ho got a DJ fired in Pennsylvania.  Felt sorry for the guy at first.  And then I'm like, you know what?  You're just dumb.  You're just stupid.  You have to know who you work for.  This was a dopey move.  It really was a dopey move.  And I was thinking, wow.  Oh, God.  And the guy, you know, he's been doing his radio show for like 17 years.  White guy.  Oof.  Huh?  White guy?  Yeah, white guy. 
[01:08:00]  But I can't feel sorry for the guy.  Here's the story.  Imus' comments rather have it only just cost him a DJ in Pennsylvania is out of a job  for repeating what Imus said.  Gary Smith used the phrase as an on-air gimmick called the phrase that pays.  Viewers could get prizes for calling in and repeating what Imus said.  And Smith was quickly fired.  He spent 17 years at that station.  Oh.  17 years.  Bye-bye.  He must have been doing pretty poorly.  They probably couldn't wait to get rid of him and the overprices they were paying him. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Let me just phrase that.  So he was doing the phrase that pays so that people have to call up and give the phrase  that pays.  And he made that the phrase that pays.  It's a dumb radio bit that boring stations do.  Yeah.  Well, he would have got away with it if he said, hey, you know, the phrase that pays today,  we only want black people calling to say that phrase.  And he would have skated.  You think?  Absolutely.  He would have skated.  Can we do a phrase that pays?  But instead of the Imus thing, it's been talked about a little too much. 
[01:09:00]  We can go back to a comic at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles.  I don't think that phrase that would be very good either, Jimmy.  Yeah, that could get us in a little bit of a jam.  You know, you've got to be very careful.  There's a lot of focus on radio guys right now.  There's a few bits that we wanted to do this week, and we went, you know what?  We have promos and sweepers ready to go.  Oh, yeah.  They're in a safe right now.  There was a little show that went on a few days ago that was very fun.  Oh, I won't get into any details. 
[01:09:30]  It was fun.  You know what?  Even your pals, Opie and Anthony, are a little smarter in the year 2007.  We're like, you know.  Because we want to work in 2008.  Yeah, let's put this in a safe for a while, and we'll get back to.  Tuck that away.  We'll get back to our shenanigans in a week or two.  Let's be honest.  We want Imus to keep his job so the target stays on his back.  Okay?  We really don't care about him.  We just don't want the target on our back.  Did they find a picture where he looked?  And look at these scumbags.  Imus off the air.  Your calls.  1-888-MSNBC-USA. 
[01:10:00]  Instead of putting the phone number for his charity where sick kids are going to get money,  these self-serving pigs put their own MSNBC number.  And that dopey president of the news department talking about integrity.  That's integrity?  Yeah.  Oh, and there's Reverend Al.  Well, they got their Reverend Al.  These pigs, instead of putting the number for the charity.  Way to give Reverend Al some credibility, by the way.  That's real smart.  Put him on civil rights activist, Reverend Al Sharpe. 
[01:10:30]  That's real smart.  In the very late.  Oh, we want that recorded.  Yeah, we'll get some of that.  Get some Reverend Al.  I can't get enough of this idiot.  I swear to God we're going to try to do some other things on our show today, but this is  what America is talking about.  It's a tidal wave.  But we will step aside for a little bit and beat up Howard next.  He deserves it.  Yep.  Another liar, by the way.  Yeah.  Another liar.  Yeah.  Him, Tim Sabian.  Liars.  And for the people that heard what we're about to play, don't worry, there's an update. 
[01:11:00]  That's why you should linger longer.  Linger longer.  We'll bring some people up to speed.  Water doodle.  No wonder they.  What?  Well, we'll bring everyone up to speed what happened a few days ago, and then we'll have  the update.  Bone dry.  The update on that, okay?  Bone dry.  And maybe we'll hear from the Greaseman next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I've got to tell you, it's days like this.  I love being on the radio. 
[01:11:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  America's losing their minds in general.  In general.  What does Colin say?  Colin always goes, the whole damn world's going to Stark Raven Med.  And he's right.  It's Stark Raven Med.  Stark Raven Med.  Old man Colin and his old man lingo, and he's right.  We're revving up for our next burst of energy, but a couple things we want to get accomplished  here.  First of all, our pals at Letterman worked in a wow reference last night. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yeah?  For Whip Him Out Wednesday, yeah.  And it had something to do with the Imus controversy.  So this is what happened on Letterman last night.  Because have you seen the new show?  Who is the new one?  Take a look at this.  This was this morning on the Imus in the Morning show.  It is now 10 minutes of the hour, and you're listening to The Morning Zoo with O-Dog and the  Goat.  Easy there, Goat.  Coming up next, we'll be giving away tickets to the Fallujah Camel Show.  We'll play another game of dialing for Jews. 
[01:12:30]  And Kevin James will call in to discuss the final episode of The King of Queens.  And don't forget, today is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  But first, here's a little song from my good friend, Blue Beggar.  A little bit of my good night.  A little bit of my good night.  A wacky morning show.  There you go.  It's funny.  And by the way, people are loving that montage we play before the break. 
[01:13:00]  And some people are a little confused why we're playing it.  We just think it's amazing that now the term is just being repeated over and over and over  and over again.  It's such an offensive term that it's made this whole controversy from Imus saying it  once in passing on his show.  And yeah, we just wanted to point out how many times it's being used by news people now. 
[01:13:30]  Just one after the other after the other.  They're using the same words that Imus said, yet they don't use the N-word.  They'll just say the N-word, even though it's part of a story.  If someone gets in trouble for using it, they don't then use that word.  And if this is so offensive, they shouldn't be saying this either.  Faggot they wouldn't say.  Right, right, faggot is another derogatory term that they would never use.  They would say a gay slur or a slur against gay people. 
[01:14:00]  They would never say that.  Yet this, I heard it a thousand times over the past two days.  Part of it is that these phonies love getting away with a little something.  It's like when the Bobbitt case happened.  They couldn't get enough of saying the word penis because they finally could justify saying the word penis.  Saying it, yeah.  And that's all this is.  It's a bunch of nerds.  And they know it's an attention-getting thing.  It's something that gets ratings.  It's something that draws your ear and eyes to the TV. 
[01:14:30]  If you're just passing by and you hear it, you'll go, what?  What did they just say?  So they're kind of using this whole thing also as an excuse to get away with using what is supposed to be such an offensive term that it's on the verge of getting a man fired from a 30, 40-year career.  Yet the newscasters, in the context of telling news, can just say it over and over and over and over and over and over.  And it just doesn't stop all night long.  Kind of like the Janet Jackson thing. 
[01:15:00]  No one really saw it when it happened live.  How many people actually heard Imus say that as it happened live?  Believe me.  And how many people were offended by it when he said it live?  How many people that are directly involved in this, the basketball team, Reverend Al, Jesse Jackson, actually heard it live?  None of them.  And then when it gets played over and over and over again, that's when people hear it.  Like you said, the same thing with Janet Jackson.  A good point was raised about how Jesse Jackson was screaming when Janet Jackson had to pay the price for what she did. 
[01:15:30]  No, she didn't.  What did she pay?  Nothing.  She got her big rack shown all over the place.  I think CBS is the ones who had to pay for that.  She didn't pay a dime.  It actually boosted her album sales.  Of course it did.  It helped her career.  It destroyed others.  She didn't pay anything.  And she made a decision to do that.  And if you can't see the difference, a stupid South Park character faced Jesse Jackson.  If you can't see the difference.  I hate his eyes.  He's a psychopath because he's all white around his eyes.  He's a kook.  Are you allowed to say that? 
[01:16:00]  I don't know.  Oh, kook.  She was being a crazy man.  If you can't see the difference between Imus blurting out something in humor and her showing her breast to however many millions of people watching, then you're an idiot.  Hey, we're going to change gears slightly here, but this is definitely worth it.  People heard this a couple days ago.  We do have an update, so hang in there if you have heard this.  But, you know, we've been talking about the Imus thing all week, and out of nowhere, someone is like, what's Howard Stern's take on this?  Who?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:16:30]  Exactly.  You notice how he hasn't been brought into this whatsoever?  He's not a factor when it comes to radio at this time.  Yeah, it's so odd to see a huge radio story like this.  And a bunch of radio personalities' names, including ours, are mentioned in the articles about things we've done in the past and stuff.  And his name doesn't really pop up.  It's so odd to see that.  But the only time his name popped up in the news was the Senjaya story.  You know that huge story that's just sweeping the nation this week? 
[01:17:00]  Well, I blew off Idol last night.  There's more important things going on in the world, like this Imus thing.  I guess they kicked off the hot chick, Haley, with the really nice legs.  I couldn't tell you.  No, Club Soda Kenny told me because, you know, that's all his brain can handle.  He can't handle, like, actually watching a news show.  This is so odd.  Who scares me?  He picks me up this morning and goes, did you hear the news?  And I'm like, oh, boy, he's going to tell me that Imus is no longer on MSNBC.  And I'm bracing for it.  He goes, they kicked off the hot chick on American Idol last night. 
[01:17:30]  That is what a dummy does when there's a huge news story.  I swear to you.  And everyone knows I love Kenny to death.  That was the first thing he told me when he picked me up this morning.  He kicked off the hot chick.  You don't know whether to get angry at him or you want to just hug him.  Yeah, pat his dry hair.  Like, what did he say about if Imus has a suspension?  I don't know.  What was his suggestion? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, he wanted Imus on our show.  And I'm like, yeah, that'll happen.  Get him on your show.  There are some things that we don't even attempt to make happen because we know it just ain't  going to happen.  Exactly.  It's not in Imus' best interest to do this program.  We know that.  The earth would have to start spinning the other way for that to even be a possibility.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, so someone brought up, you know, what does Howard think about this?  So we got some audio.  And, of course, Howard wants Imus, you know, fired because it's all about Howard, Howard, 
[01:18:30]  Howard, and this would make him look good, I guess.  I don't know.  It's all personal, too.  It has nothing to do with the bigger picture.  He doesn't give a crap about anyone else except himself.  Doesn't give a crap about other radio shows.  Doesn't give a crap about freedom of speech when it comes right down to it.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't see this as a huge issue that could affect everybody in broadcasting.  He's said it before.  He said, I care about free speech when it affects me.  Right.  Exactly.  He doesn't care about anyone else's.  So we get this clip from Howard's show, and we're assuming he's making a statement about 
[01:19:00]  Imus.  And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he decides he's got to beat us up and tell his  audience that we're doing horribly on regular radio to the point we got a 0.0 in Vegas.  A 0.0 in Vegas.  That's not good.  And as we're playing this the other day, I'm sitting there like, do we have a, I'm actually  thinking, oh my God, do we have a 0.0 in Vegas?  I know, you had me second guessing.  I'm like, did we, when did that happen?  And some people said, why didn't you go after him harder? 
[01:19:30]  And I was thinking to myself, you know what, I'm going to go do some research.  That's what I'm going to do.  Take a little look-see.  And we'll pull back a little bit, and then we'll do our research, and we'll get to the  bottom of this, right?  But then you're about to hear in this clip, too, Tim Sabian, who used to be a really good  friend of the Opie and Anthony show, the Philly people know, you know, he was in charge  of WYSP, and yeah, unfortunately, he decided to work for the enemy, even though, you know,  he said awful things about Howard to us, didn't believe in him anymore, thought his time is 
[01:20:00]  long over, but for some reason, I don't know, I guess he needed a paycheck.  He loved us.  We were the future.  We sat there in his office with him, you know, blowing smoke.  Yeah, I even, you know, called him when he went over to the little doggy company and  said, look, man, you know, you got to do what you got to do.  Congratulations.  I took the high road.  You know, we were really close.  I even slept at his house and stuff when I was in Philly.  Wow.  Because it was better than some of the crap hotels that the radio station wanted to put 
[01:20:30]  us in.  And so Howard's, he brings up the IMAS, then he brings up our ratings being a 0.0, and  then he brings Tim into the situation.  I'm like, there's no way, knowing Tim Sabian, that he's actually going to, you know, get involved  with this, knowing the reputation he has with his radio show.  Yeah.  But he jumps right on board.  Yep.  And then what you're going to.  You got to drink the Kool-Aid when you're over there.  And then what you're going to hear, too, I'm just trying to set up this whole thing nicely.  I said, you know what?  Screw that.  And I called, I called Tim up on our radio show.  So I don't know exactly what we're, I think this is the setup. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  Listen to this from the other day.  But like Opie and Anthony in Las Vegas just had a 0.0 rating.  Okay.  Remember, 0.0 in Vegas.  That's what he's saying.  Remember that.  And remember the laugh, and then there's the laughing, and let's make sure we make fun  of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  We suck.  Ha, ha, ha.  And remember, too, Howard has a 0.0 in every city in America when it comes to regular radio.  Yeah.  He's not on. 
[01:21:30]  He's not on.  When we lose our regular radio audience, we still have a bigger audience than he does  on his satellite radio show when we just broadcast on XM.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm only telling you this.  Thank you.  The people they brought in to save the situation?  I'm only telling you this to make a point.  They had a zero.  You could not.  David, I've never heard of a rating like that.  It's almost impossible to have a 0.0.  It's probably a first in radio.  It's what Blutarski's grade point average was.  I did that joke already.  Zero point. 
[01:22:00]  The only other time I've ever heard that was as a joke.  Zero point zero.  Getting back to my...  That's not a thing.  It's not one person listening.  Yeah, I've heard of 0.1.  You never get zero point zero.  See how excited they are?  They are just having a laugh at our expense.  And one reason we don't respect Howard, he's been lying his entire career to make himself  look better.  And we had the balls to say, hey, you know what?  This guy's full of crap. 
[01:22:30]  And it's gotten us in a lot of trouble over the years.  It's going to get us into some new trouble because eventually we're going to have to work  for the same company as him.  Oh boy, that's going to be a treat for everybody involved.  I'll set you up bygones.  It'll be bygones.  No?  No.  So then they continue crowing and talking about how we have a zero point zero, how we  have a zero point zero in more than one market.  And then they drag Tim in.  Tim, our old pal.  Listen closely to Tim and him showing his true character.  Tim Sabian, who used to be a friend of the show.  This is going to be beyond disappointing when you hear this clip. 
[01:23:00]  To help Howard out here.  And he says that we had a zero point zero in Chicago, which is not true.  We took over for Rover.  Who had a zero point zero.  Who had a zero point zero, which is a horrendous place to start.  Someone called me.  I would never even know about this.  I almost is looking good against a zero point zero, Artie.  Which is unbelievable.  In two markets, they had a zero point zero.  Tim, do you know?  Man.  So what I'm saying is the company is so desperate for people. 
[01:23:30]  But how in the world do you pull a zero point zero?  What was the other market with a zero point zero?  Chicago was zero point zero.  Right, there's nothing there.  And Vegas is a zero point zero.  And Vegas, and then they're flat everywhere else.  I mean, there's like nothing.  But my point is, I mean, there's like nothing.  They're in a tough position.  Okay, I'm being a gentleman.  What's the tough position on that?  I don't know.  None.  There's no competition.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, I just so don't want to.  Robin.  I just so don't want to be. 
[01:24:00]  This isn't about you.  This isn't about me.  You don't want to make it about you.  I'm making it about the corporate environment that allows Imus to stay on the air.  So there you go.  We're back live here.  So, you know, Crowen, 0.0 in Chicago, 0.0 in Vegas, right?  And they bring Tim in to back that up and say, and they're flat everywhere else.  So I'm like, you know what?  What is wrong with this guy that used to be our friend?  So I called him up.  Yeah.  Going back to the tape here.  Tim.  What are you up to?  Why did you suck Howard's **** yesterday when he was talking about the ratings? 
[01:24:30]  He asked me a question.  I told him a question.  Wait, wait, wait.  Do we have a 0.0 in Chicago?  What do you have in Chicago?  What do you have?  It's way more than a 0.0, but you had to agree with Howard.  Why?  We came in at a 0.0 when Rova was there.  We came in with a 0.0.  When Rova was there.  He called you in and you sat there and kissed his ass.  What the **** is that about?  When he asked me a question, he goes, what other station has non-got ratings? 
[01:25:00]  And I tells him the facts.  Tell him you don't **** know.  We used to have a relationship.  What the **** is wrong with you?  You have to suck his **** now that you work for him?  Back live.  Back live.  Oh, boy.  What a potty mouth.  We take it right to people.  We're not going to sit here and allow someone to just openly lie about our success on regular radio.  So the phone call continues.  It gets really ugly here.  Dude, you know damn well we don't have a 0.0 in Chicago. 
[01:25:30]  You flat out lie to help his **** point.  It's bull****.  Have you been following the ratings in Chicago?  Have you seen that the QM is up every month for the last four months in a row?  We're just under 100,000 in QM, which is nothing to brag about.  But it's way better than when we first started there.  What's the overall station?  I don't know what the overall station is.  It's still in the toilet.  But it's getting better every **** month.  Look, I understand you work for him and you work for the competition. 
[01:26:00]  But you don't have to sit there and suck his **** with misinformation.  We used to be **** friends.  What's your **** deal, man?  And then you're saying we're flat everywhere else?  Is that true?  Tell me that's true, Tim.  Show me where the stations are.  Show me where the-  You don't follow the **** ratings.  You've seen that we went up the last two months in New York.  You've seen that we have gone up in Chicago.  You saw the last trend in Boston.  I know you, dude.  We used to hang out.  You follow radio like the back of your hand. 
[01:26:30]  The **** trend in Boston was way the **** up.  Did you see the Buffalo **** numbers?  You said flat across the board.  And then Boston did go up.  You're absolutely-  So why couldn't you say that on a show?  You're too scared you're going to lose your **** job?  You have enough money to retire.  Don't take his ****.  I think he'll listen to you.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  Oh.  Wow.  What?  Bravo, Opie.  Holy ****.  See, we're cursing like sellers.  Oh, we curse a lot, don't we? 
[01:27:00]  We get to do that after 9 o'clock, so.  We're potty mouths.  I love it.  Yeah, but I'm not going to sit there and let Howard Crowe to all his listeners and just  openly lie once again, by the way.  His whole career has been made up of a lot of lies.  You know what that tape showed, by the way?  Huh?  How much credit you got to give us for the time we do over here and don't curse.  Oh, no kidding.  We curse every two seconds we talk.  I know.  And people say, how do you do it?  And I go home and go, I don't know.  I have no idea.  It's like all of a sudden on the walk to the other place, I just turn on a switch and go, 
[01:27:30]  all right, time to curse.  Isn't that amazing?  Like, we sit here for a few hours and we don't curse on the air.  And then it's just an F-fest.  Here's your update, by the way, because a lot of people did hear that the other day.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to sit there and go, wow, 0.0 in Vegas without doing my own research, okay?  And Howard Crowe and laughing, and they all had a big laugh.  Oh, what a chuckle they got over our 0.0.  I got a communique from the program director of the Vegas radio station. 
[01:28:00]  Of course, we're on KXTE.  These are the actual numbers for Vegas.  A little different than a 0.0, by the way.  Just thought I would share some numbers with you since the boys are coming to town.  They're very excited we're coming to town for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  We do it Saturday at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  The joint ticket is still available through Ticketmaster.com.  Purse is 12 plus, okay?  Are we allowed to mention numbers?  I think we are, right?  Yeah, why not? 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  I don't know.  In the latest trend, Howard Crowe and we had a 0.0.  Well, actually, we went from a 1.7, which nothing to brag about, but it's not a 0.0.  To a 2.3.  We did that in one month.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  That's a lot different than a 0.0.  0.0 or a 2.3?  Right, right, right, right.  Just a tad different.  Right.  Jackasses.  And I already proved that we're not doing a 0.0 in Chicago, okay?  Persons, 18 or 34.  Instead of a 0.0 like Howard likes to think we had and told this whole audience, it actually 
[01:29:00]  went from a 2.3, which is eh, to a 3.7 in one month.  That's way up.  Where's the 0.0?  And then men, 18 plus, we went from a 2.2 in Vegas to a 2.5 in one month.  Eh.  Not even close to a 0.0.  And looking better every day.  And then he continues, we're seeing more and more WOW stickers showing up and we're passing 
[01:29:30]  them out as often and as fast as we can.  I hope this helps.  And if you need anything else, please let me know.  See you on Saturday.  We base our show on actual facts.  0.0 my ass.  Yeah.  Well, do you think there'll be a retraction on their show?  No, of course not.  I don't think so either.  And Howard, you can send an email and thank us for actually giving you an audience today.  There you go. 
[01:30:00]  People got to actually hear your voice today.  Hear your voice again.  Dope.  We'll break.  We'll get back into the Imus thing.  The BET audio is amazing.  Oh, I haven't heard that yet.  Oh, that guy.  Amazing.  Infuriating.  What, is he the president of BET?  He's the creator.  He's the guy.  I don't know.  Is he still affiliated with BET?  He's the head guy in charge?  But he's the one that, what did he do?  He invented it.  Hey, by the way, we just got a little shout out from Mr. Imus. 
[01:30:30]  Did we?  I've been calling him Mr. Imus for the last few days.  Mr. Imus.  His name is Mr. Imus.  What did he say?  Please stop trying to help me.  Look, I'm looking for help from a lot of different people, but could Opie and Anthony stop with  the support?  You're really hurting me.  You don't want to be lumped in with us?  No.  Why not?  It's not helping my cause.  I know.  Could he have found a worse ally?  I know.  What have I felt worse?  All the reverends and politicians are against him. 
[01:31:00]  And this douchey show, and the Aryans are all for him.  That's great.  The two front-running Democratic candidates have come out and pretty much asked for my  head.  But the church effers, they're the ones supporting me.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You think you've got a list?  All right.  Here's all the people that aren't supporting you, and here's the very tiny list of people  supporting you.  I want to thank the support from the Hitler family.  Actually, I've got some nice letters of support from Mel Gibson and Michael Richards chiming 
[01:31:30]  in with their support of the program.  This guy could do better than us supporting him.  Yeah.  Steven Pagone and his family, I'm sure, are supporting you there, Mr. Imus.  I want to thank Wackbag.  Yeah, Wackbag supporting you.  Black people are all against him.  FBA.  The only black guy sticking up for him is Patrice, who has probably spent twice what  he's earned on prostitutes in Brazil.  That's the black guy supporting you. 
[01:32:00]  There you go.  He's a fag from Jersey City.  Well, we've got a little shout-out just a few minutes ago.  Long Island Railroad gunman, Colin Ferguson, supporting me, and then eating his own feces  with a spoon.  Bernie Getz.  Bernie Getz, climbing on board.  Yeah, I guess it is pretty pathetic.  Yeah.  Well, we kind of know.  He needs someone in his corner.  We're there for you, Imus.  Yeah, and this is what he said a few moments ago.  Coming up on already $200,000. 
[01:32:30]  Good grief.  Thanks to God bless all of you.  Yeah.  And my boys, Opie and Anthony, are wailing on it, too.  So good for them.  You bet.  1-877-877-6464.  You can use any credit card you have or go to WFAN.com and click on the Radiothon banner.  Yeah, please.  If you're going to make a donation, tell them, hey, you know, Opie and Anthony sent me,  and here's some money to help some sick kids, all right?  Because MSNBC did just the biggest douche move ever.  Yeah.  They have every right in America, of course, to cancel his show.  But to do it hours before he does his Radiothon that he's been doing for 18 years just shows 
[01:33:00]  what they're really about over there.  They're just scumbags.  Symbolism over substance, I think that's called.  You know, it's a symbolic move to try to appease this pressure that's been going on.  And yet, by doing that, they're actually physically hurting children by not allowing more contributions  to be made instead of hurting through words.  They'd rather put the importance on words that hurt me. 
[01:33:30]  I was very injured by, well, the words hurt me.  So sacrifice a good cause because words hurt people.  Do you think Al Roker is donating some of the money maybe that he used to shove his food  down his fat throat with?  Cut a check.  Yeah.  Now that you're not eating maybe $1,500, $3,000 worth of food a week, want to even cut  a check and send some of that money since you were so influential on having him booted.  So once again, this is a great cause. 
[01:34:00]  He's been doing it for 18 years.  And, you know, MSNBC, they know Imus' true character.  And even if they came out and said, look, we are going to cancel his show after he does  his Radiothon, they wouldn't have had a problem with Imus whatsoever.  He would have went out with dignity and he would have had the exposure of a TV audience  to help his cause.  Yeah.  They know that.  I don't have to say it.  They know that.  Right.  The phone number, again, if you want to donate to the Radiothon to benefit the Imus Ranch, 
[01:34:30]  the Tomorrow's Children's Fund, and the CJ Foundation for SIDS, you go to WFAN.com.  There's a Radiothon banner.  Or call 877-877-6464.  They're saying we should probably maybe put the number on the pad data.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Over there at XM.  I don't have confidence in that, though.  They don't know how to spell.  Oh, Jesus.  Just get the number right.  Yeah, hopefully they'll figure it out and get it up on the pad data.  Yeah, put it over there. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, and we thank you.  You know, San Giant made it through again.  I can't believe it.  Did you hear the big news?  The hot chick got kicked off American Idol. 
[01:35:30]  I'm outraged.  Oh, it's Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  We got to have our priorities.  Yes.  Did you watch the Imus thing?  I love Don Imus, but let's, you know, hot chicks.  All right.  Yeah.  Hot chicks.  Why did I bother?  By the way, a lot of people call, and we're going to try to get to the phone calls.  I mean, I've never seen more phone calls in my life doing a radio show.  Yeah, people are just fired up.  We'll try to get to you guys in a few minutes here.  Can I say I hate Charlton so much, I wish Strom Thurmond was alive so I could vote for him. 
[01:36:00]  I love Strom Thurmond.  Love him.  He's dead.  All right.  We got an Al Roker blog.  We got the founder of BET.  We got Jesse Jackson on Keith Olbermann.  Olbermann mentions he was one of the employees who recommended Imus get fired.  And then he asked Jesse if other DJs are now in trouble.  Well, I'll tell you what.  If we get in trouble, I'm not even going to acknowledge that Reverend Al Sharpton is a human being. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, no.  I will not acknowledge that.  I will not go on his dopey radio show.  No apologies.  You know, Imus did what he thought he had to do, but wow.  It just goes to show you what an apology will get you.  It keeps the story going long enough for you to get into even more trouble.  So screw it.  What do we got on Roker?  I don't know, but someone's got to buy Imus a brush.  Just buy the man a brush.  Like he has time to comb his hair right now.  That's why he wore the cowboy hat to hide that. 
[01:37:00]  But he's got to be the serious Imus now, so he's got to keep the cowboy hat off.  That's right.  It looks like I combed my hair with a c**t.  Beber.  Beber.  All right.  What do we got on Al Roker?  Al Roker put out his little blog.  I guess he's been taking some heat for what he's been saying or what he said.  He's one of the insiders at NBC that the NBC News president was talking about that voiced  his outrage at Don Imus and wanted him fired from MSNBC, at least. 
[01:37:30]  He also wants him fired from CBS.  So he wrote a blog about it.  Everyone's blogging these days.  They all want to be hurt.  When you're on a meeting this morning show, you have to be hurt somehow.  When your opinion is tossed aside at your real job.  When your opinion means nothing on TV.  Yeah.  You got to get to a computer immediately.  When your two co-workers just look at you as the guy that should tell you if you should  wear galoshes or not.  And that's as far as your opinion should go.  Yeah.  You're the non-threatening black guy at work.  That's why they like you. 
[01:38:00]  Because they're like, if they could only all be like Al, just fun and fat with an umbrella,  we wouldn't have any problem.  That's what they're thinking.  I just imagine the conversations behind closed doors.  Excuse me, boss.  I want to do something a little more serious on today's show this morning.  I got this idea for, shut up.  There's your umbrella.  Yeah.  I want to know if I need an umbrella today when I come to work.  We need you to dress like a Dalmatian today.  Right, right.  We're doing a tribute to firemen.  We need you to dress like a fire hydrant.  We're doing a tribute to dogs. 
[01:38:30]  So he wrote his blog.  And there's a kind of blog.  A little blog.  A little blog.  He has something to say, damn it.  Yeah.  He calls what Imus said, ugly racism and sexism at its worst.  Ew.  Believe me, I could think of worst.  At least Al doesn't throw around cliches.  You got to respect him.  Yeah.  At least he's a free thinker.  I think the C word, probably worse.  And I think there's probably a few other words you could use as opposed to a nappy that would be worse than that also. 
[01:39:00]  But that's his feeling.  He says, he's talking about his critics.  My freedom of speech was questioned.  Some of the complaints that came in fell in the same category.  I was denying Don Imus his freedom of speech.  Far from it.  Don Imus has the right to say whatever he wants, however hateful, stupid, or uncaring.  He does not have the right to say it on public airwaves or on the cable broadcast of a privately owned company.  How long have you been broadcasting, Al Roker? 
[01:39:30]  He doesn't have the right to say certain things on what?  See, people a lot of times think that freedom of speech just means you're going to go to jail.  Like, you know, no one's taking some dummy on a message board and saying they're not removing his liberty like as far as going to jail.  How many times have the ACLU sued for free speech when they're telling, when dress codes, they're saying it's a freedom of speech violation to not let a kid wear what he wants.  And I know there's a difference between a privately owned and public airwaves, but the principle of being able to say what you want, as long as you're not inciting some kind of violence or whatever, should remain the same. 
[01:40:00]  Exactly.  I don't think there should be a looming threat of you losing your livelihood based on what you say, especially if it's not done in a hateful, inciting a riot, the old gag, the fire in a movie theater gag.  You know, he's not doing any of that.  But there is now this atmosphere that is going to really get worse in radio where there is going to be a fear.  You have freedom of speech.  Say whatever you want, but let it be known that we're watching you and you must have this fear that your job could be lost because of what you say and not what you say that's illegal or against FCC rules like the old days or something because my feelings got hurt. 
[01:40:30]  And we're fully aware that they could get to our advertisers.  Yeah.  That's unfortunate.  It's a threat.  It's mob tactics.  I'm sorry.  I just want to.  Yeah.  They always talk about like the big brother is watching.  Man.  Man.  And it's always the repressive conservative government seen as big brother. 
[01:41:00]  And I would like the same people to now look at this situation and see, do you understand that big brother is watching from that side of the fence, too?  It's not just.  Oh, yeah.  Conservative, awful religious government.  It is the completely other side of the fence.  There is a constant threat now that is only going to get worse for broadcasters that whatever you say that might offend or hurt someone's feelings, which is completely legal to do.  You're free to offend.  You're free to say something that someone doesn't like. 
[01:41:30]  People don't understand.  But now there's a looming threat over your head that you will lose your livelihood over that.  And eventually we will.  I have no doubt now.  I have no doubt.  No, I don't either.  He does not have the right to say it on public airwaves or the cable broadcast of a publicly owned company.  That is a privilege.  Just as you do not have the right to have a license to drive a car, it's a privilege.  Is this guy trying to equate the freedom of speech, which is written into our Constitution, to driving a car and having the privilege to have a license? 
[01:42:00]  There's no license for speech.  You don't have to get a license to say things.  Unbelievable.  Another point some of my critics raised.  This is Al Roker from his blog entitled Not In My House.  That's not what it's called, is it?  Yes.  What's not in his house?  Exercise equipment?  Yeah, that's a fat joke, Al.  Thank God we can still make fat jokes, fatso. 
[01:42:30]  This week.  You just couldn't stop, could you, Al?  You just couldn't stop reaching for the pumpkin pie.  You had to have a doctor help you.  That pumpkin pie is good, isn't it?  With a nice dollop of whipped cream on it.  Will you say no to fattening food?  Not in my house.  Not in my house.  I can't believe I'm just a weatherman.  Getting whipped cream all over his keyboard while he's blogging.  I'll bet you he would eat ice cream out of an upturned umbrella.  An upside down umbrella. 
[01:43:00]  Just every dish is shaped like an umbrella, isn't it, fat boy?  Feed the emptiness.  I'm just a weatherman.  I want to be more in broadcasting.  I want to be heard.  Guy gets no respect at his job, so he's got to go to his blog and try to make a point.  He says another point.  And this.  Wait till you get a load of this one.  This guy's delusional.  Another point some of my critics raised was that I was holding Don Imus to a different standard than rappers and African-American comedians who traffic in the same kind of language. 
[01:43:30]  Guess what?  I think their speech is hateful, too.  I don't condone it.  Don't allow it in my home.  Don't use the words.  Don't go to the concerts.  How about then Don Imus says what he says.  You don't agree with it like you do these rappers.  You don't turn on his radio show.  We don't watch his show in my home.  We don't watch his show.  We don't watch it on MSNBC.  We don't listen to it on the radio.  That is what you're trying to say here.  Someone made a great point last night. 
[01:44:00]  Let the free market decide.  Yep.  Well, we should hear on the radio as long as we're adhering to the FCC regulations.  Let the free market decide on all this crap.  Listen to the benign dreck he fires out next.  Listen to the band-aid this fraud throws out next.  Those companies that profit in the demeaning of women via musical lyrics, whether rap or rock, should be put on notice.  Put on notice.  What does that mean, fat boy?  As should the radio stations that play the music. 
[01:44:30]  Others who have used hateful language have recently been fired from prominent jobs.  Who?  Who?  And what?  Were they white?  Name names.  Were they black?  Who were they?  And where is the demand that they're fired?  Where's the idea?  Like, where's the adamant attitude you had towards Imus?  They have been held accountable.  Again, who?  Who?  African-Americans who believe certain elements of rap music, music videos, and popular entertainment need to be more respectful toward our own should speak out and repudiate that element. 
[01:45:00]  I know I have, and many others have as well.  What about calling for their firing?  Yeah, why not, Al?  What about not working at NBC and tolerating what goes on upstairs at Saturday Night Live?  A lot of times they do some racially charged humor on that show.  What about that?  They work at NBC.  And he says, a slippery slope, to be sure, deciding what should be heard or not heard. 
[01:45:30]  But the difference, again, is where it is heard and who is saying it and what is their intent?  Well, what about who is saying it, Al?  Who is saying it?  Are you saying there's a different standard of free speech depending on who is saying what?  Or aren't we all equal as far as free speech is supposed to go?  You disgust me.  Now you know, by the way, why he is a weatherman.  And he's just a social dummy. 
[01:46:00]  And all he does is he's just languishing in these vagaries.  Ah, they should be put on notice.  What does that mean, stupid?  Mr. Imus misspoke when he told Matt that if all we could come up with is a few instances of racial intolerance in the span of a 30-year program, it was, in essence, not that big a deal.  Not so fast, Don.  What was the question?  How did you lose weight?  He was like, doctor, could you help me? 
[01:46:30]  I can't do it myself.  Staple, staple, staple, staple, staple, staple, staple.  Thank you, doctor.  Not so fast, Don.  On a regular basis, African-Americans, no matter who they are, were generally portrayed in a pimp or Aunt Jemima voice.  This is his argument on this.  Meanwhile, we had just played a Steve Harvey clip from his radio show barely a couple of weeks ago.  And Steve Harvey and his little crew over there, all black guys, I guess, were doing a redneck program. 
[01:47:00]  Redneck news or something.  Redneck news.  So they were portraying people from the South using a twangy kind of redneck voice and stereotypical setting of a trailer and this, that and the other thing.  Why is that acceptable, Al Roker?  But it's not if Don Imus and his crew portray African-Americans with a pimp or Aunt Jemima voice.  Yeah.  I mean, that was never done on Comedy Central recently by a great comic, Chappelle. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, Dave Chappelle.  Of course.  That wasn't done on the comedy.  I didn't hear Al or see Al blog.  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me go back a page.  That must fit into the difference, again, is where it's heard and who is saying it.  Oh, all right.  So, again, a black people, carte blanche.  Yeah, just be honest like Patrice said.  Patrice is honest, at least.  Put blacks should be able to say it.  Just say that, Al.  People have written in asking why I haven't spoken out against others who have made the same transgressions.  The answer is a simple one.  One that I'm not particularly proud of. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, where's Al?  Your waistline?  It wasn't in my house.  And it wasn't so profoundly blatant.  Don Imus broadcast under the NBC News banner via MSNBC.  This is a reflection of my company.  I won't stand for the idea.  You won't stand because your belly was too big.  Wait.  The identity of his company is more important than the identity of his racial identity?  Yeah.  So, if it's set on NBC, it's bad.  But if rappers who are routinely talking about hoes and bitches and shooting and that's okay. 
[01:48:30]  That's fine.  Because it's not on NBC.  It's fine.  Dope.  I won't stand for the idea that someone who has the privilege of working under the AGs of NBC News could damage this organization with a taint of racism and sexism.  When did the taint come into this?  I don't know.  The taint should be left alone.  On your knees.  A, he goes on with a couple other things that I really can't be bothered with.  But he goes, in the meantime, I hope that the debate over this can be civil and meaningful, not one of name calling and anger. 
[01:49:00]  Okay, fat boy.  We won't call you names.  There's still a lot of safe fatso.  He'll take away that next.  Robert Johnson, founder of BET on MSNBC.  I'm an overeating American.  Just shut up.  This is a good segue because he was asked about, you know, black entertainment.  BET, yeah, wow.  Black entertainment television.  The comics on BET, some of the music videos.  I've watched late night BET. 
[01:49:30]  Oofah.  It's like a, it is, it is an anti-white channel.  But again, white people are superior.  This is the way this vibe is.  White people are the parents and superior and therefore should be held to a higher and different standard.  Right.  We don't have the, we don't have the right to complain because it's like complaining to little children.  To children.  That's the, that's the way that this is looked at by a lot of these liberal, self-hating whites and blacks, yeah, that won't take responsibility for their own, these rappers and stuff. 
[01:50:00]  Absolutely.  And we want to say it again, too.  BET should be able to do whatever the hell they want.  And I should be able to say whatever the hell he wants on his radio show as long as he's in FCC regulations.  Why do you think I know about this stuff?  Because I enjoy watching it.  I enjoy watching things that are on BET.  I enjoy watching black comics make fun of white people.  I enjoy, it's funny.  Yeah.  It's funny.  I'm not going to bitch about it.  Here's Robert Johnson last night, MSNBC.  I think that African Americans have always felt that we have a responsibility for our own destiny and we will continue to hold that to be the case. 
[01:50:30]  And clearly I join with Reverend Sharpton in saying that if anybody within the African American community wants to hold a debate on how we treat ourselves, we ought to do it.  And I'll be the first one to ante up a place to hold it and have that debate. 
[01:51:00]  And I did that with it when I was at BET.  A debate.  See how they see the language?  Soft.  It changes.  Vague language.  Hey, if we want to talk about how African American artists are using these words and degrading women and showing our young men that this is not right.  And we want to have a debate.  We'll sit down.  We'll get some coffee.  It'll be great.  We'll have a nice little debate and nothing will get accomplished because there's no threats looming over their heads that you're going to dive in and take away their livelihood. 
[01:51:30]  How about that?  Why don't one of these guys step up and demand these record labels drop the artist?  Yep.  Where is that type of thing?  They want to have debates.  They want to have hip hop summits.  They want to have meetings.  There's not this looming threat of being fired.  Here, here.  He goes on.  I told the record industry, look, guys, if you guys want to stop making these kind of videos, believe me, I have no problems.  If you want to, I don't know.  And when you talk to the artists, the creative people, it's up to you to stop this. 
[01:52:00]  And we'll be glad to show other product that you produce.  But comparing Don Imus to an artist in a music video is apples and oranges.  Is it?  I would have picked another fruit.  They're both fruit.  It's the same thing.  All right.  Listen, we got to take a break.  Yes.  I know what you meant.  I'm so trying to steer the ship away from the rocks today. 
[01:52:30]  But the thing I'm saying, it's the soft, vague language we use.  That easy, hey, if you want to, we're willing to listen in this, that.  Where's the hard line stance?  You hear the phoniness coming out of the black community?  The phony indignation?  Absolutely.  This is what we're going to do when we get back.  We're going to open up the phone lines.  Finally.  Hang in there, people.  I'm sorry we haven't gotten to you a lot today, because we usually like to get your voices on our show. 
[01:53:00]  And I love Jason Whitlock today, a columnist, a black columnist.  I think this is the way to end today's show.  Thank God.  Reading his article.  Some sense.  It's an amazing article that kind of really, really explains a lot of the stuff we've been talking about today.  So we'll read his column next, and we'll go to the phones.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  I'll be shooting my one-hour HBO special in Washington, D.C., Saturday, June 2nd. 
[01:53:30]  I'm doing two shows at the Lincoln Theater.  These are free tickets.  If you want them, there's an email address, jimnorton at broadwayvideo.com.  You send in an email with your name, your address, and what show you want to go to, the early or the late show, and they will contact you.  That's jimnorton at broadwayvideo.com for my June 2nd HBO special being shot at the Lincoln Theater in Washington, D.C., and it is a one-hour special.  If you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, we're going to go to the phones here. 
[01:54:00]  I just want to acknowledge the behind-the-scenes staff.  They've worked their asses off the last few days.  Than and E-Rock and Steve and Travis, Sam, Derek, and Danny back at the other joint.  Unbelievable, making sure we have all our updates and all the audio we need to play on the show today.  Thank you, guys.  It's a shame they have to be fired.  Yeah, well, someone had to go, but they really stepped up, and I want to, like, make sure people know that out there.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:54:30]  Let's say hi to JR.  He's a black guy.  Usually it doesn't matter if you're black, white, yellow, green, purple.  Who gives a crap?  But I think today is important to see where some of these comments are coming from.  Green.  Green, yeah.  That's a food poisoning guy.  JR, what's up?  How are you doing?  Hey.  I am Puerto Rican and black.  My life is black, and we both start the day listening to you guys in the morning.  Thank you.  Either way, I wanted to talk about the hypocrisy of those who are basically supporting Reverend Al. 
[01:55:00]  I was having a conversation with a few co-workers about the IMUS issue, and they all think he should be fired.  However, I made the point about freedom of speech and how it was just a joke and the hypocrisy of Reverend Al and the rallies.  They were all shooting me down.  I'm sorry.  But basically, after we start work, one of the guys that I was speaking to, he walks over to another Indian co-worker and calls him a camel jockey.  The other guy, he basically starts singing along to that song that Norm was talking about, the Al Kelly song. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And then the other guy starts making jokes about the co-worker's group.  So basically, I'm talking to guys who are being hypocrites about the whole situation, about the things that they do.  Yeah, it's just a pile-on.  That's all it is.  You see a guy getting kicked.  You look at him.  He's an old white guy.  And it's fun to see an old white guy go down for saying something inappropriate.  And that's all that is.  That's why it's phony, because black people, they know where it's coming from when they hear it.  Everybody knows he was kidding.  Yeah.  All right, JR.  Thank you.  We want to do a speed round.  If you're on hold, just try to get to your point so you get a lot of voices heard here. 
[01:56:00]  Alex in New York, what's up?  Hello.  Real quick.  I called up the IMUS thing and donated.  And you know what?  I never would have ordinarily donated for the kids and whatever.  But I think it's an awesome way for us to show our support of IMUS.  You guys are right on the money.  I think it allows us to have a voice to say, you know what?  You know, the guy's right.  He did nothing wrong.  And what you guys are saying is right on the money.  And the last real quick thing, Norton, the funniest thing in the history of man, crinkle, crinkle. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, thank you, sir.  As well as the hottest.  Thank you, Alex.  Yeah, MSNBC, they didn't do the right thing.  I mean, you know, they could have canceled the show on Monday, but they did it hours before.  IMUS's Radiothon, which helps basically sick kids.  Yeah, sick children with cancer and all that stuff.  And kids dying of SIDS.  I mean, they've made a fortune.  Well, no.  No, no, they've made a fortune for the foundation. 
[01:57:00]  And the number is 877-877-6464.  Very easy to remember.  877-877-6464.  They've made a lot of strides with SIDS is what I was trying to say, but I'm kind of tired.  Don't eat whatever you want at 20 bucks.  Don't eat 20 bucks.  It doesn't have to be a lot of money.  And one of the reasons was because of the Radiothon that IMUS has been doing for 18 years.  And MSNBC decided it was really important to get him off the air before he raised money for sick kids.  Yeah.  Those douchebags.  Those douchebags.  So they can pontificate.  Yeah.  And Al Roker, while he is staring at the dessert that he can no longer eat in the MSNBC commissary, 
[01:57:30]  can say, you did really good.  Can I please editorialize somewhere?  Because I feel empty holding an umbrella at my age.  Cheryl in Jersey, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, good morning.  I'm a first-time caller.  Hi, Cheryl.  Hi.  I'd like to, can I mention another radio station on air?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dump out.  Okay.  Of course.  97.1, I'd like to say.  I actually stopped listening to them probably about six months ago because their racial comments  towards white people, such as crackers, you know, Wiggers, whatever they want to call 
[01:58:00]  us, they can.  Yeah.  But their majority of listening, 95%, I'd say, probably are African-American.  Yes.  You know, hardly white people call that show, and they make fun of us all the time.  I feel this is terrible, what Imus is going through.  I'm sure he, you know, he is an elderly gentleman, an older man.  An elderly gentleman.  I'm sure that makes him feel good. 
[01:58:30]  He's pushing 70, I think.  I mean, he's got to laugh about this.  I mean, it's like my grandmother's saying, you know, do you like my bling, almost.  You know, she's trying to be cool.  I mean, there's other rappers that sing songs about hoes and bitches and this and that, but  that's okay.  Yeah.  Someone made the point last night that Imus is way too old to really know what's going  on around him.  Like, he's on the internet trying to find out the latest slang in the black culture.  He obviously said that because he's heard it so many times around him just in everyday 
[01:59:00]  life.  And it's acceptable, and other people haven't said anything, but all of a sudden, Ronel  Sharpton jumps on this bandwagon once again.  Yeah, Hot 97 could say whatever the hell they want about Whitey.  And once again, yeah, we think they should be able to say whatever they want, and Imus  and us and everyone else should be able to do whatever they want.  What's with this hula hoop?  Something the kids are.  It offended me to the point where I don't even listen to their radio station anymore,  and I'd like a full boycott of MSNBC and 97.1. 
[01:59:30]  Well, that's what you did the right thing.  If you don't like 97, you don't listen to it.  You don't listen.  They don't say whatever they want to say.  I'm not trying to get anyone fired, right?  Yeah, just don't listen.  All right, thank you, Cheryl.  Goodbye, madam.  Want to try to get some other people on the air.  Steve in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Steve.  It's actually Ski, but that's all right.  All right.  I just want to let you guys know that I came home after work today, and I donated.  I'm his line, and I actually convinced my mother, who hates you guys, mainly Jimmy  Norton, for saying anus about two months ago. 
[02:00:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I don't even remember what context it was.  He said anus, and my mother was just like, who would say anus on the radio show?  Tell mom to settle down on a good boy.  You know how many fans we got because Jimmy said that?  I apologize.  I know.  They're all in too many.  It probably wasn't the actual word.  It was probably what he said just before.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Well, let me apologize.  Something like, I like to, and then don't apologize.  I'm sorry.  All right, Steve, but you donated money to Imus' cause today?  Yes, I did, and my mother.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, we need-  Two damage.  Two damage. 
[02:00:30]  Froncus.  Hey, man.  Two damage.  Chill out.  We're trying to show everyone that we have a little intelligence today.  He punched out.  I know.  He gave four damage.  I wasn't even able to cast my spell.  All of our listeners will be trying to make points.  People go, that's a good point.  Froncus.  Yeah.  We're being monitored today.  We've been monitored all week, so we're trying to show some intelligence.  I know.  So no hilarious or froncus or any of that.  Ramones or any of that.  Yeah, no Ramones.  Dennis in Philly, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, buddy?  Dan?  Hey, you guys took a little bit of my scene, but about just wanting other radio stations 
[02:01:00]  to be able to say what they say as well.  It's not like we're trying to get them off the air or anything like that.  But my main point was that freedom of speech is there because we need to be able to say  whatever we want because any minor comment, excuse me, any minor comment that we say  can be taken as something completely crazy.  I mean, somebody could say something, cats or something.  Next thing you know, the crazy cat lady next door could be calling PETA or ASPCA and they  could be knocking on your door and, you know, asking for your head. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, it doesn't matter what you talk about.  Someone's going to be mad at it or upset or it's going to hurt someone's feelings.  You're doing a comedy show.  Like one time I was in a hospital and there was a bunch of very sick people and none of  them could walk.  And I just wanted to be funny.  So I started yelling fire, fire, fire, and they had to drag a lot of these sick people  out and a few of them died.  And all of a sudden, I'm the bad guy.  Now you are the bad guy.  It's freedom of speech.  Now I'm the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy.  All right, let's go to Jason in Buffalo.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[02:02:00]  Hey, it's going to be a great game tonight.  Islanders-Sabers.  What do you think there, Jason?  Oh, I can't wait for it, man.  Buffalo's going to kick some ass.  What a surprise that you would say, Buffalo.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  I wonder if there are Islander fans in Buffalo.  No.  All right, you're listening on the edge.  What's going on, Jason?  Oh, not much.  I just want to say I donated some money to that, and the young lady on the line said,  oh, another ONA fan.  She's like, I just wish we had a column for this.  That's pretty cool.  The ONA fans are being heard over there. 
[02:02:30]  That's nice.  That's good.  It's a way to show support, you know, and show MSNBC that they're a bunch of tools and  help out, you know, sick kids.  Not particularly in that order.  I guess the sick kid thing would have been first on that list.  A bunch of things, and then, oh, yeah, sick kids.  Ima's really helped us get back on regular radio, by the way.  He called us personally and said, look, you know, the XM thing is really cool and stuff.  Get to say whatever you want.  But, you know, you're not really talking to a lot of people yet.  As that new service continues to grow, you will. 
[02:03:00]  And I think you guys really need and should be on regular radio.  And he made some big calls for us, and that really helped us get back on regular radio.  And I'll never forget that.  Let's say hi to Danny in Lindenhurst.  Danny, what's up?  Listen, I think we should boycott.  We should hurt Al Sharpton's pocket in a big way.  That squirming little bastard, he picks on an old man who doesn't have a fight left in him  instead of going after some real issues, after gangsters, after, hey, those girls at Rutgers. 
[02:03:30]  You're going to tell me that they don't listen to rap artists putting down the black females,  the black women of this country?  Of course they do.  I would think they do, but who knows?  I would think they would listen to that before they listen to Don Imus.  That's for sure.  I guarantee you some of them do.  Yeah, but he's going after a guy who doesn't have a fight left in him.  He's an easy target.  Of course.  We should hurt Sharpton's pocket. 
[02:04:00]  Why don't you guys make a list?  If you told me what Al Sharpton does and where he gets his money, I'd love to try to boycott it,  but it's a mystery to everybody where this guy gets his goddamn money from.  He's just a floating fat man with a nice hairdo.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm never buying another thing from Staples.  I'm never buying another thing from Staples.  Yeah, they're really arranging those cowards.  All right.  Stupid office supplies.  Go Home Depot.  All right, Danny.  Thank you.  I'm dumb.  Let's say hi to Sean in Jersey.  Sean. 
[02:04:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Love you.  I love the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to say with MSNBC dropping Imus before the whole telethon thing.  Basically, MSNBC is a bunch of baby killers.  Hey, there you go.  All right.  That's his way to go.  One way to put it.  All of a sudden, they're a me-lie.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to get to that in a sec, Jimmy.  Crystal in Jersey.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I relate to what Cheryl's saying.  It all starts with the rap music.  It's so hostile. 
[02:05:00]  It makes you want to kill people.  It puts down women.  It says racial slurs about the own black community.  What the hell is going on?  Don't these people wake up and see what they're listening to?  Yeah.  In the news last night with all those gangsters being locked up, they were all black, but that's  okay.  Kill them.  That's fine.  You're right about that, and just the fact that Don Imus, an older guy who's white, even  knew those words, where do you think he heard those words? 
[02:05:30]  From other white people he hangs out with?  That came from hearing it used by black people.  Hearing it to the point where he just assumed that it was completely acceptable to say on  his radio show.  He had to say what he said after the fact, but he thought, oh, I've heard this so many  times.  It's got to be acceptable.  But according to people like Al Sharpton.  But see, no one told us the rules.  There's a rule.  The rule is that freedom of speech is purely based on the color of your skin.  I'll bet you Imus only rents black on blondes porn. 
[02:06:00]  Maybe that's where you got it.  Black on blondes.  Hey, thank you, Crystal.  All right, that leads the...  That's some good stuff.  Black on blondes porno.  That phone call leads into this unbelievable column that we found from Jason Whitlock.  Kansas City, this guy.  Kansas City, he's a black columnist.  I guess it's important to say that today.  Imus is just going to spend his time watching the gimp scene from Pulp Fiction over and over  again.  Yeah, give it to him.  Yeah, yeah.  And Jason Whitlock, black columnist, he writes, Imus isn't the real bad guy. 
[02:06:30]  Instead of wasting time on irrelevant shock jocks, black leaders need to be fighting a growing  gangster culture.  Thank you, Don Imus.  You've given us black people an excuse to avoid our real problem.  You've given Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson another opportunity to pretend that the old  fight, which is now the safe and lucrative fight, is still the most important fight in  our push for true economic and social equality.  You've given Vivian Stringer and Rutgers the chance to hold a nationally televised recruiting  celebration, expertly disguised as a news conference to respond to your poor attempt 
[02:07:00]  at humor.  Thank you, Don Imus.  You extended Black History Month to April, and we can once again wallow in victimhood,  protest like it's 1965, and delude ourselves into believing that fixing your hatred is more  necessary than eradicating our self-hatred.  The bigots win again.  While we're fixated on a bad joke cracked by an irrelevant bad shock jock, I'm sure at least  one of the marvelous young women on the Rutgers basketball team is somewhere snapping her fingers 
[02:07:30]  to the beat of 50 cents, 50 cents, he writes, or Snoop Dogg's or Young Jeezy's latest old  glorifying nappy-headed pimps and hoes.  I ain't saying Jesse, Al, and Vivian are gold diggers, but they don't have the heart to  mount a legitimate campaign against the real black folk killers.  It is us.  At this time, we are our own worst enemies.  We have allowed our youths to buy into a culture, hip-hop, that has been perverted, corrupted,  and overtaken by prison culture. 
[02:08:00]  The music, attitude, and behavior expressed in this culture is anti-black, anti-education,  demeaning, self-destructive, pro-drug dealing, and violent.  Rather than confront this heinous enemy from within, we sit back and wait for someone like  Imus to have a slip of the tongue and make the mistake of repeating the things we say about  ourselves.  Great line.  Jesus.  This is an amazing line right here.  It's embarrassing.  Dave Chappelle was offered $50 million to make racially incentive jokes about black and  white people on TV. 
[02:08:30]  He was hailed as a genius.  Black comedians routinely crack jokes about white and black people, and we all laugh out  loud.  I'm no Don Imus apologist.  He and his tiny companion, Mike Lupica, blasted me after I fell out with ESPN.  Imus is a hack.  But in my view, he didn't do anything outside the norm for shock jocks and comedians.  He also offered an apology.  That should have been the end of this whole affair.  Instead, it's only the beginning.  It's an opportunity for Stringer, Jackson, and Sharpton to step on victim platforms and 
[02:09:00]  elevate themselves and their agendas.  And he has a money sign for the S in agendas.  Yep.  I watched the Rutgers news conference and was ashamed.  Martin Luther King Jr. spoke for eight minutes in 1963 at the March on Washington.  At the time, black people could be lynched and denied fundamental rights with this little  thought.  With the comments of a talk show host most of her players had never heard of before last  week, serving as her excuse, Vivian Stringer rambled on for 30 minutes about the amazing  season her team had. 
[02:09:30]  Somehow, we're supposed to believe that the comments of a man with virtually no connection  to the sports world ruined Rutgers' wonderful season.  Had a broadcaster with credibility and a platform in the sports world uttered the words Imus did,  I could understand a level of outrage.  But an hour-long press conference over a man who has already apologized, already been  suspended, and is already insignificant and just plain intellectually dishonest, is just  plain intellectually dishonest, excuse me.  This is opportunism.  This is a distraction. 
[02:10:00]  In the grand scheme, Don Imus is no threat to us in general and no threat to black women  in particular.  If his words are so powerful and so destructive and must be rebuked so forcefully, then what  should we do about the idiot rappers on BET, MTV, and every black-owned radio station in  the country who use words much more powerful and much more destructive?  I don't listen or watch Imus' show regularly.  Has he at any point glorified selling crack cocaine to black women?  Has he celebrated black men shooting at each other randomly? 
[02:10:30]  Has he suggested in any way that it's cool to be a baby daddy rather than a husband and  a parent?  Does he tell his listeners that they're suckers for pursuing education and that they're selling  out their race if they do?  When Imus does any of that, call me and I'll get upset.  Until then, he is what he is, a washed-up shock jock who is very easy to ignore when you're  not looking to be made a victim.  No.  We all know where the real battleground is.  We know that the gangsta rappers and their followers in the athletic world have far bigger 
[02:11:00]  platforms to negatively define us than some old white man with a bad radio show.  There's no money and lots of danger in that battle, so Jesse and Al are gonna sit it out.  This is Jason Whitlock, a columnist from Kansas City.  Kansas City star.  We tried to get him on the phone today, but I'm sure his phone's ringing off the hook.  Probably very busy.  That was a really, really good article.  Obviously, he's not a fan of Imus.  But I like that.  Yeah, yeah.  It makes it a little more balanced. 
[02:11:30]  You notice how well I read when it's important?  Yes.  Thank you.  Feeding is fundamental.  Thank you.  It was good that he's not like saying – he's obviously not.  He's just saying Imus is an irrelevant zero.  Like, I don't care about him.  He's not like one of these –  Yeah, it doesn't matter who it is, really.  It's just – he makes great points, though, on the double standard and where the real problem lies and the fact that it's a distraction.  Yeah.  And until they address issues in their own community.  All right.  Love that word.  Patrice was right, though. 
[02:12:00]  Patrice, you gotta say, he's an awful friend and an awful person, but he made some damn good points.  Yep.  And he was right.  It was going to be hip-hop next.  Yeah.  Patrice was right.  The plugs.  We're flying to Vegas after tomorrow's show for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show Saturday.  Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, The Joint.  Eight or nine comedians.  Very excited.  This starts the whole thing.  We've got a press conference by the pool in the early afternoon.  We encourage our listeners, if you're in the area, to come on by and check that out.  It's going to be just a very festive time for everybody. 
[02:12:30]  Very excited about the comedy show.  And then we'll have the press conference announcing all the other dates.  But Saturday is the first one in Vegas.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com and all the info is on our website.  Jimmy?  I have one.  It's for June 2nd.  I'm shooting my one-hour HBO special in Washington, D.C. at the Lincoln Theater.  There are two shows.  These are free tickets.  If you want to come, you write an email with where you're from, your name and address, and all that stuff to jimnortonatbroadwayvideo.com.  They will absolutely get back to you.  jimnortonatbroadwayvideo.com. 
[02:13:00]  And I want to do it in D.C. and I'm doing it in D.C.  And finally, more importantly, a lot of people are asking for the phone number.  Imus is doing his Radiothon.  He's been doing it for 18 years.  It helps sick kids, okay?  And MSNBC just showing their true character.  Dumped him knowing that he was going to do the Radiothon on MSNBC and on his radio show.  So drastically cutting his audience down.  Knowing full well that donations would be drastically cut.  Bastards couldn't wait.  They don't give a crap about sick kids is how I look at it. 
[02:13:30]  So we're trying to pick up the ball and help out Imus today.  So give him a call.  877-877-6464.  Donate a dollar.  Whatever.  Whatever you can afford.  You know?  That would make a statement.  And tell him Opie and Anthony sent you.  And that you're trying to help out the sick kids for Mr. Imus.  Something that people don't really want to acknowledge or talk about in the media for some reason.  Yeah.  All the great stuff he's done with his radio career.  I want to see if somebody mentions it tomorrow. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  MSNBC did that.  Hey guys, thank you.  This is why we love doing radio.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  If not, have a great day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll see you guys over at XM. 
[02:14:30]  We'll see you guys over at XM. 
[02:15:00]  We'll see you next time. 
[02:15:30]  We'll see you next time. 
[02:16:00]  We'll see you next time. 
[02:16:30]  We'll see you next time. 
[02:17:00]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:17:30]  Here we are at XM.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Here we are.  Yeah.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Where we curse.  We curse.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Let's say hi to Joe. 
[02:18:00]  Joe.  Joe in Ohio.  What's up.  What's up.  I want to tell you guys?  XM Satellite Radio.  We'll see you next time.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  I know the good words getting out.  That's good.  The fans.  And they're not going to hold on us down, man.  Hey, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  I just want to.  What a privilege.  I just want to say, and this is coming from Greg Hughes, that I'm really, really proud of  our fans today. 
[02:18:30]  No, no jokes whatsoever.  Yeah.  We'll get back to the jokes in about 10 seconds, but.  They are assholes, but they know when to come to the table.  Yeah, Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show,  thanks you very, very much today.  Thanks, Joe.  Hey, all right, Chief.  Keep it rocking, buddy.  All right.  John in Colorado.  John, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I made a donation there over to the IMA's Fun deal,  and the lady on the phone just said that she's really grateful for you guys 
[02:19:00]  and your show and everything, so just thought I'd pass the word on to you.  Yeah, that's cool.  It's on the pad data.  I see it for myself now.  There's the phone number.  Don't have to give it out anymore.  IMA's Radiothon.  That's for sick kids, just in case you're tuning in.  And MSNBC felt like it wasn't really important to have him on the air today  to help with his Radiothon, so we're trying to pick up the slack.  And maybe people can make a call to MSNBC's offices and say,  why the fuck did you take this guy off when he's doing a children's cancer benefit?  Like Opie said before, and he was right. 
[02:19:30]  It is a privately owned company.  That's their right.  They want to take him off.  I don't know if they can do that.  But how do you do it the day he's doing this charity?  Kids with cancer, you shitbag.  It's amazing.  They used the word integrity last night a lot.  Integrity.  We only show six children with cancer when it will get us ratings.  As far as helping them, fuck them in the mouth.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  That's their stance.  Unbelievable.  Well, everyone's calling to say they made a donation.  Look, Bruce in Syracuse.  Bruce, what's up? 
[02:20:00]  Hey, I just wanted to say I called and made a donation myself.  I told the woman I supported IMIS, and I was big Opie and Anthony fans,  and I said that's where I heard about the donations from.  Right on, man.  And she says, you know, we've been really busy now just because of their fans.  So you guys are really helping spread the word,  and I think we should help set a record for donations.  Well, he usually, I guess I was paying attention,  he usually raises $3 million in two days.  Yeah.  Wow.  But, you know, MSNBC really made that possible  because they reached a lot more people than just his radio show. 
[02:20:30]  So I don't know.  If we're able to hit $3 million again this year,  that would say a lot for our listeners and say a lot for people in general.  Thank you, Bruce.  Thank you, guys.  Hey, let's go to Diana from California.  Diana.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I want to know where that black girl is,  the one who always calls in and harasses you guys.  No, she's okay.  I've heard about black rights.  Where the fuck is she now?  No, no, no, no.  She's not bad.  She's all right.  And she calls us for good reasons, too.  We like her.  No, she called early on in this controversy.  Me? 
[02:21:00]  I'm the girl that was shaving my pussy in the tub that day.  We know who you are.  Goodbye.  It's not about you, douchebag.  We understand pussy shaver.  Godspeed.  At least your pussy won't be a nappy, pussied hoe.  We're trying to explain to you, Diana, who's now gone,  that, what is her name?  Jennifer?  No, Angela?  No.  No.  Young Missy?  A black girl that...  Amy?  Is it an Amy, maybe?  No.  Ah, whatever. 
[02:21:30]  She did call early on in this controversy,  and she completely thought, you know...  Oh, I know what it is.  That the whole situation was out of control.  Yeah, her name was...  No?  Was it...  Or...  Or...  Or...  That's insensitive.  Or...  No?  Hey, we'll talk to MSNBC.  Give me a phone number.  We'll talk to the anchor that's on right now.  Oh, God.  Let's call him.  Look, they felt like they didn't want anything to do with Mr. Imus, 
[02:22:00]  but I swear we've had MSNBC on all day to monitor the situation,  and they haven't talked about anything else.  Yeah, just Imus.  Let's call him.  Did you hear Jesse Jackson on there last night?  We got it.  When he said...  We got it.  Yeah.  Oh, we got the clip?  Yeah.  Which one do you want, Ant?  Well, the whole thing was infuriating.  All right.  Let's start from the beginning, then.  Let's see if we can understand him, first of all.  I...  This guy was... 
[02:22:30]  You could barely understand him years ago,  but something's happened to him where he's really unintelligible.  You just can't understand him.  His mouth is doing something different than his face.  Yeah.  It's just...  I don't know what kind of accent that is.  And the Duke...  Amanda.  Amanda's in there.  Huh?  The Duke girl's out of the paper.  She's in the paper, but no one's talking about the Duke accuser.  Oh, no.  They're all talking about Don Imus.  Not the black fucking chick that just ruined or almost ruined three lives.  Yep.  And cost an entire lacrosse team a season. 
[02:23:00]  Not some...  That's a sports story.  What about them?  Yeah.  What about that sports story?  What about the fucking damage she did to them?  By the way...  Fucking phonies.  By the way, if we have any pull with XM Satellite Radio,  when Imus gets fired, I hope...  I just hope they bring him to XM.  He would be welcome with open arms.  That's right.  In middays.  Right.  Not on this channel, though.  We need our replay.  Sorry, Iman.  Go to find another channel. 
[02:23:30]  We'll put you on Air America.  We'll put you on the 40s channel.  That was a great decade.  Imus in the morning.  I'm trying to think of some of the hip-hop channels,  because that's the joke, but I didn't...  Oh, put him on a hip-hop channel?  Oh, The Street, I think, is mine.  Yo, yo, my niggas.  Coming up, Snoop Dogg with his latest.  Speaking of Snoop Dogg 
[02:24:00]  And then we'll get into the Jesse  Jeff and PA has something  Jeff go ahead  Yeah guys  Has Eric Logan or anybody at XM  Talked about what if anything they're going to do with Snoop Dogg  Because of what he specifically said about Imus  Nothing  Why would they  I don't like what he said  But why would they  Snoop Dogg should be able to say what he said about Imus  Even though it's silly  I think it's inconsistent  And he's a hypocrite  But he should be able to  We're not trying to get anyone fired  Or thrown off 
[02:24:30]  That would be being hypocrites on our part  I just want to point out  That there is a double standard going on  That's all  I just kind of want separate but equal  Right  Separate but equal  Alright thank you sir  Thanks guys  You should be able to do your rap songs  You should be able to do your edgy material on a radio show  Of course  Jesse Jackson Anthony with Keith Olbermann  Gizzo  It's official man  I hate Keith Olbermann  He's a cunt  People have been saying things about him for a while 
[02:25:00]  I can't be bothered to really focus that much on his show  But last night I was watching like crazy  And this goody two shoes  And he is a tool  Who thinks he has some kind of credibility now  He used to be on ESPN just doing sports scores  Well here we go  But let's start sir  With your overall reaction to MSNBC and NBC's decisions  Well it is a victory for public decency  The airways should not be conduits for racism 
[02:25:30]  No clue  You said to try to understand what he's saying  It's a victory for decency  The airways should not be conduit  A conduit for racism  And indecency  Well indecency the FCC takes care of that  Yes they do  So thank you Jesse Jackson  But people are already fucking up radio  In the FCC with indecency  So you don't have to worry about that  Indecency taken care of  If you say something that's considered indecent  On the radio 
[02:26:00]  The FCC steps in  So don't worry about that  Racism  Sorry  You're kind of allowed to express that ideology  On public airwaves  As long as you're not behaving that way  Like in a way that's oppressing somebody  Or encouraging someone to be injured  You can't get on the air  And call to arms  You can't say  Hey here's a call to arms  I want to start the race war  Kind of thing  And tell people to go out  And start murdering people  That is hatred  It's racism 
[02:26:30]  It's you know  Illegal  Like Hotel Rwanda  Yeah yeah  Get the cockroaches  Yeah  Chop down the big tree  It is time to chop the big tree  You know  It's not  We're not talking about that  We're talking about speech  That people don't agree with  People find offensive to them personally  People are sensitive to  That's allowed  Conduit for racism  You're allowed to say that shit 
[02:27:00]  Yeah  So shut up  By the way  Maybe for another day  Hey did you see the Tostitos commercial  That either Louis C.K. wrote  Or they stole his bid from Lucky Louis  Which one?  The very first scene of the show  When his daughter keeps asking why  They did the exact same thing in the commercial  It's Derek from Philly  Oh why?  You can try to get a copy of that  And see what that's all about  For a future show  Tostitos are for queers  There you go  It is a victory for public decency  And we should not be conduits  For racism 
[02:27:30]  Or racist bigotry  Or misogyny  Or religious bigotry  And sponsors should not underwrite it  That's one dimension of it  But it's also fair to say  That many of the employees  Last week sent emails  And they felt pals  Because they got no response last week  The almost ones should have perhaps  Caught this when it happened  Last week  But it was not caught  There is some combination  Of the internal uprising  And public pressure  That made NBC  Revered its own status 
[02:28:00]  Which was of course  The right thing to do  Honestly I can't focus enough  To listen to what he has to say  It's really hard to figure out  What he's saying  Every third word or so  Is unintelligible  But you can kind of figure it out  It's like a puzzle  It's like a Jesse Jackson puzzle game  Where you listen to a speech  Try to figure out what he's saying  While you take out every third word  Is that why he didn't become bigger  In the black community?  Oh bigger  Yes it's why he didn't become bigger 
[02:28:30]  Because Obama has a way about him  When he speaks  Well yeah  Yes he just lies  I hope you don't tie it into a man  At least you can understand  What he's saying  Yes I'm cold  Jesse Jackson  Freezing lips right Jimmy?  Purple lips  Thin white man  Purple lips  He really bugs me  Jesse Jackson  You cannot understand  Thank you  I don't know what that is  Is it a speech impediment?  I don't know  Or an accent?  Or some kind of neurological problem? 
[02:29:00]  What the fuck is that?  I think he has to swallow  Every third word  At one point I think he said MSNBC  But I'm not sure  It's like he was trying to pronounce it as a word  Oh these poor guys  You picked the wrong day to come here  We're more serious than funny today  Oh  What did you say?  What?  Fucking miscreant  Oh  I thought you said mystery race  No  Mystery race  Oh yeah  What nationality are you sir? 
[02:29:30]  I'm half black and half Polish  Wow  Stop it  You're not  Give me a pen  How the hell did your parents hook up?  Call the media  We found one  Get in here  I've never heard of that before in my life  My goodness  My dad's black  And my mom's Polish, Finnish, and Lithuanian  Oh nice  He wanted the hot little blonde  And she wanted the guy with the big dick  Yep  There you go  Pretty much  Yeah  Yeah  Nice  Black white people are very good looking  I'm not flirting with you  I'm just saying black and white people do a very good  I always said supermodels  Yeah they make supermodels 
[02:30:00]  If you want a supermodel  You get a white woman together with a black guy  And forget about it  They spit out supermodels  With my luck though  I'd have Nell Carter with big blocky white spots  There's no  There's nothing better than  When you get a black couple together  A black and white couple together  And they have a kid  That has like big blue eyes  Permatan  And like blondish hair  It's like how the hell did that happen?  Hair like Sam  They're beautiful 
[02:30:30]  Yeah  Oh and a body like Sam  And a face like Sam  Absolutely  A dick like Sam  And rosy red cheeks like Chris Harris  Nice ass spankable ass like Sam  Sam's ass is probably too thin  Candy head  E-Rock's got a spankable  E-Rock's ass on Sam's body  Would just be  A hetero or homosexual person's fuck dream  You give me Sam's  If I may  Fiona Apple-ish body  Right  Eric's plump  Ish  Yes  Ish  Happy  Fiona Apple-ish  It's identical  E-Rock's  Plump  Who does his ass remind me 
[02:31:00]  It's almost J-Lo  You give me that fucking delicious J-Lo ass  He's more like J-Lo  Watch it wiggle  See it jiggle  Where is he?  And that's just his forehead  I know  I love your joke about  His forehead was wiggling from the fat  I didn't like when he ran  And his  I hate his medium shirts  Give him the XL  And stop drying it  On fucking  Core of the sun temperature  Stupid 
[02:31:30]  Piece of shit  By an XL  Fucking tumble dry  Just as you're saying  That he's trying to pull his  Like sweatshirt  Oh he's trying  His best  He's a mess  He's trying to cover up  Hey Jimmy  Whose butt are you going to be touching today?  We gotta keep the streak alive  Hey we gotta fan  I thought you gotta volunteer  No because his hand went up  Damn it  I don't go for that  He wants it  He's smart  I don't trust him  Come on handsome  I'm delicious  Wow he likes you  He has a frightening face 
[02:32:00]  I have a Cro-Magnon forehead  You really do  And he looks like fucking Amon Gert  And he bugs me  Gert  You should be fucking  Firing at someone randomly  For fucking up the tub scrubbing  Beat it  Go hit him the Jewish maid  In the basement  And then choke her  Do you know you'll tempt me?  More Jesse Jackson  Thank you guys  Enjoy a little more Jesse  Enjoy the show  Jackson believes this was a pattern of beehiver  How did you say beehiver?  Beehiver?  A pattern of beehiver  The goddamn bees got nothing to do with it 
[02:32:30]  A pattern of beehiver  After all this is a pattern of behavior  It's not only did they say these girls were hardcore hoes  No nap-headed hoes  No likening to Memphis Grizzly bears  But that took a shot at Venus and Serena Williams  It shouldn't be in playboy  They should be in National Geographic  Geographic  Geographic  Something to kind of shot at Gwen Ifill  Took a shot at Maya Angelou  Even when Hillary Clinton spoke to blacks in Selma, Alabama  That maybe next year she'll have cornrows  And she'll have gold teeth in her mouth 
[02:33:00]  So this kind of lineage of pattern  There was a reason for that  You fucking phony liar  He left the reason out  Hold on my eight  He said that  He said that Hillary Clinton next time she'll have cornrows and gold teeth  Because when she was speaking in Selma  She put on a stereotypical black accent for some reason  Assimilating in a fraudulent way  Right  She was putting  She was doing a character  Why didn't she get in trouble for that  She put on like 
[02:33:30]  They were saying a pimp voice  Or Aunt Jemima voice  As some gentleman wrote in the paper today  I don't understand that  I wish we could hear that again  That was great  What the hell is that about  So he misrepresented that statement  He's just a dope  Lineage of patterns  This did not step up  Now I'm glad NBC did step up  But we can't stop here  What?  Because whether it is on NBC television  Or whether it is on CBS radio  Or even music  We must raise a higher ethical standard for all the music 
[02:34:00]  Because we cannot allow these images of violence to continue  Because if you can call a woman a hoe and she will submit to it  That's the first step toward domestic violence  That must stop  What?  Wow, that's a strange  First step toward domestic violence  And that must stop  If you call a woman a hoe and she submits to it  That right there is not about I am this  That is about rap  And you dumb motherfuckers  That were self-righteously standing up against I am this  You should have realized  It's about circling the wagons  We are all performers 
[02:34:30]  Yep  And the free speech of a performer is all we have  All of us  I mean really  50 Cent  Snoop  I am this  Every one of us  Have a  We talk for a living  And our opinions are a part of what we're talking  We're not just news people  Oh by the way  10 dead  26 wounded  In Baghdad Bridge  Bombing  Anyway  They're saying it looks like it's Al-Qaeda  But whatever  Anyway  Who gives a shit about that right?  Yeah  I missed the important thing  They should have defended his right to say that 
[02:35:00]  Even though it was ignorant  Yeah  If he pulled Michael Richards shit on television  He's got to go  That's a line  Michael Richards tirade was hateful  It was  Even though again  I'm one of those people that I don't care  If he sees it as some kind of art  It's fine by me  If someone doesn't want to hear it  And what they did was walk out  That's fine  Get up  Walk out  Ask for a refund  If you paid good money  That you didn't want to see that  That's fine 
[02:35:30]  But like if Imus would have said it like that  With that tone  And that  That reason that he said it  Yeah  Then there would have been a big problem  He should have been fired  But the times we have to say this  It was in humor  It was a dopey joke  And they're treating it now like  He just went all out  And was asking for a lynching  So why are they not  I want to see them fight to remove  The livelihood  Of one of these rappers 
[02:36:00]  They don't have really sponsors  Well they do have sponsors  In a lot of cases  Yeah  But not only the sponsors  But going after the record stores  And the Viacoms  And all those companies  That produce them  Go after them  And threaten to boycott  The same fucking way  You just did with MSNBC  Not discussions  Not hip hop summits  We're talking hardcore protests  Okay  Where are the signs  Where are the signs  That they're holding up  And protesting with  Well he's busy  Jackson says this is another step  In the right direction 
[02:36:30]  Toward detoxifying  Oh no  The airwaves  After Michael Rich  Did his tirade  About using the N-word  And the communist store said  No one else can do that  Coming back from our stage  And when a comedian did  They find him  So no more  The communist store  Using the N-word  Communists  That's a step  A number of disc jockers  They will no longer play records  Using the N-word  That's a step  This move today  On the  Out  The tirades  On the iron minister's show  Is another step  And they will not have momentum 
[02:37:00]  To speak to artists  I mean after all  Viacom  CBS  Viacom  Ons BET  With much of this  Is transmitted  Time Warner  Ons  HBO  With much of this  Transmitted  So we cannot stop  Here as we seek  To detoxify the airways  There must be  An ethical standard  That all of us  Have to have some  High regard for  Did you notice  What he just did there also  He said  A Viacom  Viacom  Owns BET  And 
[02:37:30]  AOL  Time Warner  Owns  HBO  And stuff  So it's almost like  He's saying  Look  We gotta go up the ladder  Till we hit  The corporate level  You know  The man  It's like BET  Can't be held  Responsible on their own  I can't go there  And complain  To the staff  At BET  We gotta go  All the way up  The ladder  To these big corporations  That are owned  By old white guys  Yeah but I also think  He's saying 
[02:38:00]  That that's how you  I'm not gonna defend him  But I think that's  A tremendous threat  To BET  What he just said  Those fucking dummies  Is that  He said  They own  What he's saying is  We're gonna go  Way over your heads  And threaten the whole  Structure of that company  Because you're  Prevying this shit  That's what I think  He was saying there  And I'm glad  I don't wanna defend  Yes  Stine is believing  But that's what  I think he was saying  He was going over the heads  That's where you go  You go to the top  Of the corporate chain  And you hit them  Because they're the ones  Who fucking have to  Answer the stockholders  Stine is believing  Because it is not  In their best interest  Or in the interest 
[02:38:30]  Of their constituency  To take away  Money  And livelihood  Of black people  So he won't do it  And HBO by the way  Why would you go  After HBO  They're a pay service  Yeah  They're a fucking pay service  And what  What type of stuff  Is done on HBO  And what  Does that mean  Like  You don't air  Pulp Fiction  Because of the scene  From  Where  Quentin Tarantino  Is there with  Jules  And Vince  And they gotta get rid of 
[02:39:00]  The you know  Marvin was shot in the face  You take that whole scene out  That's a white guy  Saying  Did you see a sign  That said  Digger storage  How about roots  Do you show it in roots  Do you show it in roots  Do you show it  Like where  Where is  Where's the line  What do you do  It's an entertainment show  It's not a documentary  As far as  Pulp Fiction goes  It's  So  So where's the line  How come then  A white guy  Is able to play  A character 
[02:39:30]  Where he's able  To use that language  Against a black guy  It just doesn't make sense  It's based in  Fucking fraudulent  Grandstanding  Yeah  And uh  An opinion  Uh  Oberman  Is a douche  He mentions  He was one of the employees  Who recommended  Imus gets fired  Good  You rat  What a douche  You fucking rat  Hopefully they come  For you next  For some dumb thing  You do  It's really gotten  Like this  And I hate to  I'm not gonna blow it  Out of proportion  So don't 
[02:40:00]  Don't take me literally  Uh  But there is this  Air  Of  A  Nazi  Germany  Type thing  Going on  Where  You gotta watch out  What you say  And  Who hears it  And then you gotta  Say something  To bolster  The good  That was done  Like  Oberman gets on  And he starts saying  I was there  Saying that  You know  He should be fired  He had a crow about that  To show his bosses 
[02:40:30]  Look  I'm with the cause  I'm behind you  Out of fear  These people are doing this  Out of fear  Stipulating  Sir  That I was one of those  NBC employees  Who put it out  To my bosses  Behind the scenes  I'm a good scourge  He's a little  We all hate people  Like this  Behind the scenes  Behind the scenes  And I helped  You know the guy  He's in your office  Excuse me boss  Can I uh  Can I talk to you for a minute  And then you like  Go into his office 
[02:41:00]  And close the door  And then  And then you have to say  This is off the record  Right  Yeah  I want to make sure  This is off the record  But this is what I think  Oberman is a cunt  And a hall monitor  He's a fucking  Hall monitor  Safety patrol  A hall monitor  You got your little  White sash on  With the badge on it  Now he's bragging about it  And he has every right  To say this stuff  To his boss  I'll say that again  But why not say it  In the open  Yep  Not after the fact 
[02:41:30]  Like ah see  I just want to let you know  I went to my boss  Well you had a forum  You had a forum  A TV show every night  But you didn't have the balls  To say it then  Now did ya  How about saying it then  Right  A regard for  What happened  What  Something happened there  He babbled something  I'll uh  Oberman  Stipulating sir  That I was one of those  NBC employees  Who put it out to my bosses  Behind the scenes  That this could not stand  That this change  Involving Don Imus  Had to be made  I can say that now  I respected my employers 
[02:42:00]  And did not say it  Until they reached  This conclusion  Which I applaud  Sincerely  Let me ask you again  About the other people  Is someone like  Rush Limbaugh  How have they kept  Their time slots  Will there be  An increased  Effort to  Either get them  To contain themselves  Within the  Rounds of decency  Are they on the ropes  Are they on probation  Because of this  That must be  You fucking  Liberal cunt  You have to mention 
[02:42:30]  Rush Limbaugh  That's the problem  With black people  And not fucking  Violent rap  Yeah  What a faggot  This guy is  Well they brought up  Because Rush had called  Obama  A half-frican-american  Yeah I know  Half-frican  Good  He called him that  And then  He brought up  A couple of things  And then they actually  Brought up  Neil Bortz  What did Neil Bortz say  I started laughing  Last night  When I said  And then  Disc chocking  Neil Bortz  I couldn't get

[02:51:00]  Of all the other talk shows  And what they've said wrong  Keith Oberman  Had to be the tattletale  On this  And say this to  Jesse Jackson last night  Guys by the way  Dick jokes on the way  Don't worry  Alright  Don Imus was not alone  Among those who have  Made remarks like this  Let me go through a few  Names and then ask you  A question  In terms of momentum  In terms of fairness  Comments by people  Like Rush Limbaugh  Who calls  Senator Barack Obama  And actress Halle Berry  Quote  African Americans 
[02:51:30]  Michael Savage  Who asked whether  The voting right acts  Intended to counteract  Racial discrimination  At the ballot box  Was trying to  Quote  Put a chad  In every crack house  There's Neil Bortz  The other radio talker  Who said the black  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney  Looked quote  Like a ghetto slut  Glenn Beck from CNN  And ABC  Who referred to the  Largely African American  Survivors of Hurricane  Katrina in New Orleans  As quote  Scumbags  And who when he  Interviewed the black  Muslim Congressman  Keith Ellison  From Minnesota said  He felt like saying 
[02:52:00]  To him  Sir prove to me  That you are not  Working with our enemies  Can I ask you  I wonder why  Why didn't  Disgusting  Groveling  Oberman  Mention anybody  In hip hop  Or mention any  Black people  He doesn't have the balls  Why didn't  Fucking  What a  Groveling  Terrified of black  People  Fucking white guy  That is  And that does not  Show one ounce  Of respect for black  People  That is not the type  Of guy that hangs  Out with black guys  And sits around  And bullshits with him  That is not 
[02:52:30]  He's the fucking  Cornball white guy  In the office  Who wants the  Fucking black guys  Who are under him  To respect him  And think he's cool  You fucking  Jizz bucket  Yep  There you go  Hey we gotta take a break  But I just gotta  Communicate from  Imus' camp  What's going on  Pretty close to  Imus' camp  These days  It's from Mark  Chernoff  Who obviously  Used to be the  Program director  For E.F.M.  Yeah he left that  Job  As our  Program director  Because he really  Was uncomfortable  With our show  And maybe getting  In trouble  Yeah he 
[02:53:00]  He didn't want  The controversy  Yeah  I swear to god  He's one of those  PD's that really  Doesn't like controversy  So he left  And went over  To the Imus  In the morning show  Well he was doing  Both shows  And then he realized  You know  I'm too old  I've been around  Too long  I don't really  Want to be involved  With like Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  So I'll just stick  With Imus  He wished us well  He had nothing  Bad to say about us  He just thought  As far as his career  Goes it would be  Better off if he  Just did Imus' show  And now look  What did the email say  Imus has been dragged out  Screaming the n-word  He writes 
[02:53:30]  You guys are unbelievable  And of course  We're talking to our fans  As well right now  Yeah it's the fans  You guys are unbelievable  You've more than helped  Blow out the phones  And website  And it's only the first day  Imus has been thanking you  All morning Opie  He's calling you his son  That's cool  I don't want to be  Known as Imus' son anymore  Not the son of a racist  Yeah right  Who wants to be  The son of a racist  It was all fun and games  But not  I want to invite you  To the ranch  For our cross burning  No it's not 
[02:54:00]  And what question  Do you have to be  Be very proud  If you light the cross  Open this evening  It was all fun and games  Until last week  Let's not continue  With that storyline  Mr Imus  I just had  I thought of one  And I couldn't  Get it out  Old sandwich mouth  What was the question  You asked  What  Who wants to be  The son of a racist  Yeah who wants to be  The son of a racist  I just wanted to say  Your kid's better  You asshole  I couldn't get out  Yeah that's a good one  And he  How does this sound 
[02:54:30]  Grand  Wizard  Hugh  You like that  No  Someday  All this will be yours  The ranch  All the hoods  He  Right  Sheets  He continues  We'll still be doing it  Right through Imus' show  Tomorrow  Greg  Opie  Imus  Greg  Opie  Imus  How does that sound  Pretty good huh  It has a  Has a nice ring to it  Certain ring to it 
[02:55:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  Not a mega noose  He continues  We'll still be doing it  Right through Imus' show  Tomorrow  And I predict  Imus' last show  Oh god  Don't predict  You already predicted  That he'd be gone  From MSNB  I think CBS  Has no choice  After fucking NBC  And MSNBC  Doing what they had to do  Come on CBS  Hang in there man  We'll still be doing it  Right through Imus' show  Tomorrow  So any help tomorrow  Is more than appreciated  You guys are terrific  And we owe you  A big debt of gratitude  Many thanks Mark  So once again 
[02:55:30]  If you're just waking up  Oh you said last show  What  You predicted his last show  On MSNBC  Oh no no I'm sorry  Oh okay okay  I misunderstood you  Oh yeah you know what  Yeah I should have clarified  No I just added a little bit  To his email  But if you're just waking up  It's right on the pad data  Imus Radiothon  877-877-6464  MSNBC  They were talking about  Integrity last night  And that's why  They had to get rid of Imus  And that was just  A mere hours  Before he was starting  His Radiothon 
[02:56:00]  For sick kids  Yeah I mean if you had  Any fucking sense  Or morality  Or this phony morality  You have  If you had any real morality  You know it's their prerogative  To fire or hire  Whoever the fuck they want  That's just the way it is  So if they really  Had this internal pressure  To get rid of Imus  His suspension  Was slated for Monday  He was supposed to be  On suspension  Why not wait until Monday  And then announce  Hey we've decided  Even after his suspension  We're not taking him back 
[02:56:30]  And let him use your airwaves  Not for this hatred  And hate speech  That apparently he's up to  But raising money  For great charities  Something he's done  For many years  And let him use your airwaves  For that bit of good  As a last gesture  On your channel  So the last thing  That Imus could have done  On MSNBC  Was raise money  For sick kids  And dying children  And instead  Hours beforehand  You fire them 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  And let less people  Contribute money  And MSNBC knows his character  They know what he's all about  Of course  He would have  He would have done  The right thing  He wouldn't have done  Anything too crazy  Of course not  He would have raised money  For sick kids  That's what he would have done  He would have done  And they could have waited  Until 10 o'clock  Every morning  And if it was all about  Separating themselves from Imus  Then why  Do they spend the whole time  That he would have been live  On MSNBC  Talking about  How they fired him 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  That time could have been used  Raising money  Why don't you separate  But you couldn't separate now  Could you  Because it was all about the ratings  You know everyone  Is talking about Imus  And it's really hot  So of course  You couldn't help yourselves  And you made sure  You did  Nothing but Imus coverage  All morning long  Because people were tuning in  To see  A disgrace  They're fucking losers  A disgrace  So the phone number  Is right on the pad data  877-877-6464  Tell them Opie and Anthony  Sent you  Asking our listeners  To really  You know  Come to the table  On this one 
[02:58:00]  And help out  Be great  Oh wait  As we go to break here  This was just moments ago  Just moments ago  Well I want to once again  Thank Opie and Anthony  Because  You know  They get it  They always have got it  Absolutely  They should have never been fired  When they did get fired  Nope  And a lot of people  Understand that  And  But they're back  And I'm happy they are  And  They've been very supportive  About all this this morning  And  I love Opie to death 
[02:58:30]  And they've been very supportive  Of me  And  They know I appreciate it  We all do  God  Oh that's cool  Older white DJs love me  What's that about  They're homosexual  Don't call Imus a homosexual  He's a homosexual  He has a shaggy do  And he likes Opie's young firm body  I don't blame Imus  Don and I are in cahoots  On that one  Oh Jesus  You can't call Imus a homosexual  He's a married man 
[02:59:00]  To a beautiful lady  A very beautiful beard  He is  He's not a beard  He's not even just a homosexual  He's in waiting  He's a homosexual  In waiting for young Greg  That old queen  Alright thanks  Bye  One of  One of the bosses  From way way upstairs  Saying he's never been  More proud of us  Oh wow  And  And Jimmy  In this building?  Huh?  No no no  CBS  That was one  That was one of the  Flying  Brothers  Saying  You guys are unbelievable  For what you're doing 
[02:59:30]  And stepping up  Like you're doing today  See we don't like to be  Predictable on this show  And it's not  It's  It's a great cause  And it's  It's showing that  MSNBC  Are being idiots  As far as the situation goes  And  It's showing that  Our listeners  Really know how to  Come to the table  When it's needed  To support  A good cause  And  Imus  We're in this  Long haul  I mean it's  You know we said it a while ago  It's lifestyle this show  It's not just a goofy radio show 
[03:00:00]  Yeah we try to have fun  And do dick jokes  And all that  But we also hang with everybody  We get together a lot  And we also can get together  For a real cause  Every once in a while too  Yeah  We can beat up other DJs  When that's important  But right now  This is really important  So  What did he say  In the beginning of the clip  I couldn't really understand  That we were supporting  We never should have  Got thrown off the radio  To begin with  Oh he said that  Yeah  They never should have  Got fired  I just want to hear  The first part again  Well I want to once again  Thank Opie and Anthony  Cause  You know  They get it  They always have got it  Absolutely 
[03:00:30]  They should have never been fired  When they did get fired  And a lot of people  Understand that  And  But they're back  And I'm happy they are  And  Cool  Very cool  See he  You know  I like that guy  I think he said  That we get it  We understand this whole thing  Yeah we certainly do  It happened to us twice  It's just yeah  Having been in that situation  A couple of times now  We understand what that's like  To go through  And especially when it's a situation  Where  The media 
[03:01:00]  Takes a hold of something  And really  Runs with it  And you end up screwed  And it's that doubt  That not knowing about  Your own future  It gives you such a  Horrid feeling inside  And just to know  That that's what he's going through  Right now  Is really like  Ugh  Ugh  And believe me  It's not  The goddamn  Rutgers team  For all this stuff  They're saying  That they're poor girls  They're going through everything  They're not  It's like that guy  That wrote the article there  That we just read 
[03:01:30]  They're probably  Snapping their fingers  To Snoop music  Where they're talking about  Hoes and stuff  Right  I don't think they were  Hurt by this  Until people told them  They were supposed to be  Hurt by this  You know  And also  My miss is still  Going to meet with them  Yeah  God bless them  Because I would be like  You know  I know  A little fed up  At that point  But I would be like  You know  Whatever now  And  Shit  What was the other thought  That may help him on radio  Not that he's doing it  For that reason  But  That may keep him on radio 
[03:02:00]  Is the meeting with them  And I think he would  Meet with them anyway  He seems pretty sincere  He would  That's one thing too  You know  We could detect phonies  Yeah  A mile away  Believe me  And this  Really  Looks sincere  On Imus' part  And I would  Definitely say  That this is  He's absolutely  Sorry for what he said  And not just  To save a job  And you know  The guy's  He's a gentleman  And it comes from a reliable source  Imus walking around  You know  The hallways  Of where he broadcasts from 
[03:02:30]  Yeah  He's been heard saying  A couple times  Man I don't want to go out this way  No  He's at the end of his career  He knows that  Although I think he just  Re-upped with CBS  I'll be  I think  Be on the radio  Until he's 150  But he's like  Is he 150  I don't want to go out this way  I think he's going to start  Fighting back  You watch  Yeah  You watch  I mean unfortunately  I hope CBS does the right thing  I don't really have much confidence in that  I don't know  They might man  He's been  There's the douche  I hope so  Steve Kappus  NBC News President  That's hysterical 
[03:03:00]  You pointed at your TV  Yeah  At the same time  I was looking at mine  And it was Joel Hollander  Right when you said  There's the douche  I'm like  What the hell  Someone related to him  Just called us  Live on the show  And he even said  I don't care that you're in the middle of a broadcast  I need to say this right now  I've never been more proud of you guys  I wish I could have put that on the air  That's cool  Alright  Steve Kappus  Has juicy  Dick sucking lips  I am not a homosexual  Nor am I inclined to homosexuality 
[03:03:30]  Right  But Steve Kappus  Has a mouth  Like a 10 year old's pussy  I don't know if I can say that on terrestrial radio  No  You can't  Hey what happened to the pad data  Did we go off the air or something  What happened  We need that phone number up there  Yeah keep the number up there  I can't hear you  Alright we'll figure that out  Danny  But even if you have a dollar  It just shows a lot  You know  Give them a call  877-877-6464  Danny can't spell a phone number  Oh there it is 
[03:04:00]  E-I-G-H  I'm his radiothon  It's helping sick kids  Sick kids for the next two days  This was scheduled  And that's one reason why CBS  They understand the overall picture  They're like  Well it would be smart to suspend the guy immediately  But they knew this radiothon was happening  That was the reason they kept him on the air  And he's been doing it for 18 years  He's doing it for maybe  I don't know  Does he go off the air now?  Or soon  I'm sure they'll keep taking donations though  Yeah yeah absolutely  They do it 24 hours  I think Benigno who I love 
[03:04:30]  After I miss him  They'll keep going with this  So keep the phones ringing  And tell them you're calling from the Opie and Anthony show  It also shows that we do do some good stuff with this show  You said doo doo  Well yeah  But the media likes to portray us as just a bunch of douches that do dick jokes  No  I just did a doo doo joke  Did you say doo doo?  Yeah  You're offending German Americans  Ja  Ja  Leichen  Das gut ja  You know what  Maybe we'll do something different next  Whoa  Maybe

Well we got a break with this  Oh that Newsday article is pretty good too  Jessica from Jersey  Hey guys love ya  My brother's over in Iraq fighting a war that this administration bills as a fight for our freedom  Which should include freedom of speech  And this is how we thank him?  Bullshit  It makes me sick  Thanks for all you're doing on this one  Jessica from Jersey  Alright  We'll be back  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony 
[03:05:30]  Ooh  It's in my shoes  Ramon  Clean this up  It's the Opie and Anthony shoe  I guess we made the Time magazine article that's coming out 
[03:06:00]  Which one does it say that I called a goer?  Remember that?  Imus is on the cover  I don't know when it hits newsstands and we got an advanced copy  And basically they say that if you and I or Mandouche had made the nappy-headed comment  It wouldn't have been a blip because future presidents do not do cable news interviews with Opie and Anthony and Mandouche  Ah, Mandouche 
[03:06:30]  Anyway  You know, the New York radio message board, the mecca of all radio message boards  Has a little thread going on it about Opie and Anthony devote their show to defend Imus  And then somebody post  In the interest of full disclosure  It should be noted that Opie fully credited Imus for helping them get employed again at CBS radio  No, not  So they do owe him  It wasn't a fully  It wasn't like Imus  Was involved in any negotiation to get us back 
[03:07:00]  He said he would love to have us back  And if he mentioned things to higher ups  That's great  That's one thing  But in the end it all came down to  The bigwigs wanting to hire us  They needed us  They needed us  Absolutely  They needed us after Roth  I mean, come on  Who else were they getting?  We're the last desperate move  For Christ's sake  But then he points out that it was nice, though  That they're encouraging their listeners to donate  Yeah 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, okay  I'm sure that thread will grow into a  Opie and Anthony suck dick thread  Well, they always end up that way  Message boards are wonderful  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  What's your take on it, Frank?  The radio critic  I want to pet  I want to pet  He likes  Oh, Frank likes us  I know, but he's bashing Imus now  He's so  Is he really?  He's so  Typical of a  Like, what everyone is saying  What guilt-ridden white people are saying 
[03:08:00]  It's like out of a textbook of guilty white people  What he's saying about Imus  That he should be fired  That this is horrible  What we've done to these poor African-American athletes  And, you know, it's just the same riot  Act read over and over again  What do I want to do?  I want to pet Mikey the Chimp on his little head  Where is Mikey?  Looks like maybe we're starting for early next week  We're going to try to get him in  They contacted me  You worked with little Mikey?  I did  And he loved me  They said he bonded with me faster than anybody  He grabbed me by the hand and he ran me around  And they had to actually ask me to leave the area 
[03:08:30]  When he was doing stuff with other people  Because he was distracted with little Jimmy?  Yeah, he wouldn't stop playing with me  He would always come over to me  How old's Mikey now?  I don't know  He's probably 30 and he's got a cigar  Big white beard  Yeah, he liked to fuck people  And he just remembered me  No, he was like very  He was in diapers  As he proposed to me  Nothing cuter than a little chimp in diapers  Yeah, it's like a little retarded kid  That you walk around with  But you put him on your foot  He sits on your foot  And you bounce your foot up and down  That's giving him a little ride  And that means he likes you  And then he grabbed me with his little monkey hands 
[03:09:00]  And ran me in circles  I saw a Discovery Channel thing the other day  That was frightening  And they just talked about how these chimpanzees are running wild  And what they do out in the wild to each other  And what happens when humans get in the way  And they show that guy that was giving Mo  His chimp Mo  Who was staying at this refuge  A birthday cake  Remember that guy?  He got his fingers ripped off  And they went into detail  And actually showed the guy's face  It ripped his face off  The chimp ripped his nose  And cheek and everything  Like you would peel an orange 
[03:09:30]  Yeah  And ripped his hands off  And his fingers on another hand  They bit him, right?  And then, yeah  It was just tearing him apart  And then went for the testicles  Because apparently  They go for the testicles  Rip them off  And then  Get them as far away from  The person  Or a chimp that they're attacking  As possible  It's like some kind of a  You're not going to mate  You know, I'm taking away your bloodline  Is pretty much it  Creepy  So, this guy  Is he like any better now?  Or is he still a mess?  Oh, he's a fucking mess 
[03:10:00]  Any better?  Any better  How are you better  After a chimp rips your balls off  And eats your face?  Good point  It's horrible  It's all up from there  Yeah  It's all up  You know you've reached bottom  When that happens  But Mikey is supposed to come in?  Yeah, I want Mikey  And they contacted me  And they use him for movies and stuff  I've never liked  Because I always  I think they're adorable  And I've never actually been able  To like pet a little chimp  I held him  I was carrying him  Yeah  He was sitting on my lap for a scene  But he was such a bad boy  He was so poorly behaved 
[03:10:30]  Was he?  At one point he just ran around  They had to go chase him  All rambunctious  Like a little kid  Yeah  Then he laid with me for a while  And he just got  All over my feet  Fuck him  No, he wouldn't  He had a diaper  I figured his little duty butt  That's the little duty butt  When they change him  It's the funniest thing  They have to change him  And wipe his ass  So they fucking  They stand him up  And he puts his chimp foot  Against the wall  And they pull his diaper off  It's so fucking  Hold the bottle  Drinking  Like, go ahead  Clean it  Clean my ass  Oh, that's funny  Like being an old person 
[03:11:00]  Jimmy, you're getting laughs out there  You're getting quiet laughs though  Oh, I love that  They're a little shy  With their laughs today  Oh, by the way  This just in  I'm going to be butt rubbing  With Imus  Oh  Yeah  Stealing Jimmy's bit  Yeah, you know  But I figure it's worth it  Let's do some butt rubbing  And me and the Iron Man  Will be rubbing naked butts  Me and my boy  My son  You're going to send him  A Father's Day card  How the fuck did that happen?  That'd be cool  I went to a dumb book signing  And I can't get rid of him now  Was there a long line of people? 
[03:11:30]  I waited on a line  I didn't even  I just waited  I was the last person on a line  I said, you know what  I'm just going to wait this out  I'm not going to go  To the front of the line  Of all the good times  Bad times we had  I just want to tell you  I love you, Dad  Fuck  Thank you, Opie  Send him a little father's thing  Fuck  You guys can sit there  Look at the cats in the cradle  Yeah  Alright, hey  The boy was just like me  Racist 
[03:12:00]  Teasing, I miss  I want Mikey the Chimp  To shit in his stupid cowboy hat  No  That's my goal  For Mikey  To take a watery  I ate food  That's not made  For a primate body  Shit  I miss his cowboy hat  No  We got some shy guys out there  They're laughing  But very, very quietly  See, they're now waving  Who's he got with the glasses?  Where do I know you from?  He's been around  I'm the Improv  And the West Palm Week show  Oh, cool  Okay, I know you  Wait, we met you down  In West Palm, too?  Yeah, I was the dullard  What?  I was the dullard 
[03:12:30]  That's right  He came into the studio  He talked  He was the dullard  Oh, yeah  Dullard  Yes, we thought that he was  Oh, we thought that  Was so important that he needs a mic  Are you crazy?  He said he's the dullard  Exactly  Oh, wait  I'm not allowed to make fun of E-Rock  E-Rock, that was a good move  You're on top of things  No, E-Rock talked about  The guy was carrying  First baseman's mitts  And then he realized  They were just his ears  Jesus, sir  Fuck you  Oh, yeah  Those are massive moves  That's all right  I can't be Mark Gable  Had big ears  I'm not allowed to be mean to E-Rock  Until next Tuesday 
[03:13:00]  Why?  I said I'd be nice  If he rubbed your butt, Jimmy  You don't have to, though  I have to  I gotta keep my word  Geek Squad perv tries to record  Customer showering  Huh?  Yeah  Oh, no  Trying to get slowly back into  Geek Squad  Those little Volkswagen driving  Yeah, yeah  Will help you hook up your computer, guys  Yeah, yeah  I get messages to those scumbags all the time  Do you?  Yeah, I should keep my shower on  Instead of fixing a broken computer  Today a technician is accused of 
[03:13:30]  Taping a young woman  Taking a shower in her own home  The suspect is under arrest  But the family is suing his employer  Best Buy  K-Cow Online's Mark Coogan  Live right now on the Miracle Mile  We'll have more on this for us  Mark  David, this family today  Filed an invasion of privacy lawsuit  Against the electronics chain Best Buy  And also the Geek Squad  The organization that fixes computers  On grounds that a technician from the Geek Squad  Allegedly came over to fix a computer  But instead  Secretly recorded a 22-year-old woman  Taking a shower  According to the lawsuit 
[03:14:00]  And the attorney, Gloria Allred  Representing the family  The family called on the Geek Squad  To come over and fix two computers last March  But instead  The technician got into the bathroom  And planted his cell phone in there  Which takes video recordings  And pressed the record button  That's probably  He's probably going to get in trouble at work  Yeah, he could  Sorry  That's very funny  I was reading  And then I realized what you said 
[03:14:30]  And it's very funny  I'm going to get in trouble at work  How'd you catch him?  You know, though  You walk into a house  But there's some hot girl  And what?  She's going to take a shower?  When the fucking  When you got a service guy over the house?  Yeah  That's insanity  It really is  Because of the guy  That's got the switch  We talk about the switch  The perv switch  The perv switch  Some people can control it  You just look and go  That's a hot chick  That's about  Well, she's in the shower right now  And then, you know  Use your mental imagery 
[03:15:00]  And fantasy  To maybe  Use it later on  While you crank one out  But  This guy was like  She's in the shower  I guess  I gotta record the naked broad  I'm off with camera  It's gonna  Pal talk  What is he doing?  He's gonna boom mic  Over the shower  Geek squad  Felon 01  His camera  Over the top  Of a shower curtain  What do you want to hear  From the victim?  It's a little steamy  Well, how'd you catch him?  Would you say?  No, let's find out  I went into the shower 
[03:15:30]  To take my shower  And then when I came out  I noticed it was like  Behind the sink  The phone  And then I looked at it  And it was like  The little red dot  Was recording  So Sarah called  On her sister Kelly  He's a hack  He's a part of  The geek squad  That's the best  He could come up with  The best you could do  Why did he fucking  Put the red light on?  He should've taped over it  Like I do  Of course  Everyone knows that  Called on her sister Kelly  Who removed the memory chip  From the phone  I was just thinking  Like if I could take 
[03:16:00]  The memory out of the phone  Then I wouldn't have to see  Like my sister on the internet  Or  Him making money off my sister  In the restroom  Together  The sisters took the memory chip  To a phone store  When we got to the  Bryson store  We let him know  We wanted to see  What was on the chip  So they gave us  Another phone  And then he  Got to wherever  The file was at  And then he just  Let me view the file  By myself  I'll need this chip  For a while  I was embarrassed  I didn't even want to 
[03:16:30]  Look at it  Anymore  Just whatever I did see  I didn't want to see  Now by this time  The mother of these  Resourceful sisters  Had called the police  And the mother  Stalled the technician  At the house  Until police came  And arrested the man  He's due in court  In Pomona next month  What was he doing  While they were off  At the Verizon store  Yeah  He's not wondering  Where's my phone  These two are going  To the store  Where's my memory chip  Where's my memory chip  My phone  The mother stalled her  I'm going to take a bath  Yeah  Okay  Where's my camera  I have to shit  Are you trying to  Install a toilet can 
[03:17:00]  Over a bucket  And make it look  Like a toilet  Hey  It's been brought  To our attention  By a bunch of listeners  On instant feedback  That we're on  Drudge Report  Oh yeah  Update 821  They've been just following  The Imus show  All day today  On Drudge  And update 821  There's a quote  From Imus  Yeah he's kind of  I think he's fighting  Back a bit  I don't like that 
[03:17:30]  Well yeah  Well the headline is  When is Reverend Al  Going to apologize  To the Duke lacrosse players  Yeah well  But 821 AM  I want to thank  Opie and Anthony  I love them  And I love what they do  I know they offend people  Perhaps more than I do  They're good loyal guys  Even Howard Stern  Hasn't been horrible  Hasn't been horrible  Although if you read  This Stern show summary  Seems like Stern  Still has his claws  Out against his  Long time nemesis  So there you go  Whining about him  Yeah 
[03:18:00]  You know he should have  Said that to Sharpton  I wish Imus  Would have said that  To Sharpton  Like why  When are you gonna  Oh because the Duke  Lacrosse players  Hadn't been  It just hit  It hit like the next day  Jimmy  Unfortunately  I know  That would have  Reverend Al  Would have cancelled  That exchange  Guaranteed  Despite the controversy  Imus says  Contributions for  The Tomorrow's Children Fund  And the Imus Ranch  Are way way up  Compared to this time  In the show last year  Which is significant  Because the money's  More important this year  Than ever  He added 
[03:18:30]  These bastards  Went after me  They got me  But they didn't  Catch me asleep  Hmm  Sounds like he's  Getting a little pissed  He should be furious  Look at him  He's getting pissed  Alright  Good  Good  I hope they break  All the records  Yeah the phone number  Is up on our pad data  877-877-6464  He's raising money  For Sick Kids  Today and Tomorrow  And I'm thinking  Tomorrow might be  His last show  For a while  I don't know  If CBS will do it  I don't know 
[03:19:00]  I'm hoping not  I hope I know  Alright  Let's say hi to Vince  He's black  He's from Mississippi  He's on the  Opie and Anthony show  Vince what's up  Hey how you doing  Opie  Hey I've been listening  To you guys  For about two years  I agree with  A lot of things  You're saying  But  It sounds like  The black  Races  You know  Black people  Are being blamed  The black people  Don't really have 
[03:19:30]  The power  You know what I mean  No that was a lot  You know something  I know what you're saying  Because I've heard  This argument before  And this is why  A lot of black leaders  And  Reverends  And what not  Will say  That blacks  Are incapable  Of being racist  Because they don't have  The power base  To be racist  And that's an excuse  They use sometimes  As to why  They can't be called out  On certain things  But the fact of the matter  Is that might have  Washed years ago  The black people  In this day and age 
[03:20:00]  In this country  Have a lot more power  Than they're letting on to  They know it  White people know it  But for some reason  No one really wants  To say it  But through example  You see that black people  In 2007  And in the past couple  Of years as a matter of fact  Have more power  Than they've ever had before  In such a short period of time  Vince are you saying that  Because white people  Technically run NBC  And MSNBC and stuff  No  No  I'm just saying 
[03:20:30]  Like you know  As far as the black race  I'm not talking about  You know  The so called leaders  Which  I think they do it for  For themselves  Not  You know  For the race  What type of power  Would  The black people  Find ideal  Like what  And like you said  Not the leaders  Just the black people  What type of power base  Do you guys want  Well  See  This is the thing  Like this  I'm this issue  If you talk 
[03:21:00]  Within a black community  A lot of the people  Don't even know about  Or don't even care about it  Exactly  It's just a few  A few  That's in the spotlight  You know  Whatever agenda  That they can put their name out  They will attach to  Right  But  As far as the  You know  You know  I'm a black guy  What's important to me  Is my family  You know  Keeping the bills paid  Doing a good job  Yes see  Now this is the majority  Of black guys 
[03:21:30]  That's what I'm trying to say  It's like  This  This isn't what  Reverend Al  And Jesse Jackson  Portray  Because  A downtrodden  Stepped on  Black man  Is what gives them  Power and a job  The second  People start seeing  That black people  In this country  Have opportunity  Have jobs  Have families  That they care about  And go to work  To support  Their gig is over  They need people  Of their own race 
[03:22:00]  To be victimized  And you  My friend  Are an enemy  For Al Sharpton  And Jesse Jackson  They don't like  Seeing people like you  That have a family  Responsibility  Take care of their bills  Their kids  Because it puts them  Out of work  They need victims  Yeah  And the whole division  The whole division thing  It makes it worse  You know what I mean  Yeah  Rather than  Trying to come together 
[03:22:30]  Trying to  You know  You give words  Power anyway  By  Saying oh  I'm so hurt  Because of this  Because of that  You know  Word is a word  I heard what  Ima said  I wasn't offended  By it  If you're hanging out  At a party  And a black girl  Is sitting there  And you know  You're just throwing shit  Back and forth  At each other  And some girl  Says something  And a guy  Will say  You know  Shut up hoe  Or something  Is she going to be  So hurt  That it's going to  Affect her  For the rest of her life  Or is it just  Commonplace 
[03:23:00]  No  She's not going to  Be affected  That way  And see  That's what  I'm talking about  You know  This thing  Is media driven  And all of this  And you know  I'm as  Lose's job  Of it  I don't know  What the situation  Was  Or who was  Rubbed the wrong way  But those girls  I bet  Someone  Like you say  Told them  That they should  Be sad  They should be  Yeah  I believe that too  Yeah  That they should  Be upset  And you know  Come out with  A profound speech 
[03:23:30]  That shows how  Hurt and damaged  This makes  All of them  It's ridiculous  The words thrown around  At parties  And in school  I'm sure they've  Heard it before  And you just  Most of the time  Like Patrice said  They turn around  And go  Oh no you didn't  Did you just call me  You know  Maybe the guy  Will get a smack  In his face  But as far as  Being scarred  For the rest of your life  Just stop with the drama  You know  Well I agree with you there  Vince  As far as that's concerned 
[03:24:00]  Yeah like I say  You know  Love the show  I mean  I'm pretty objective  When it comes to  I thought you were  Going to stop there  And say you're pretty  Yeah well  Jimmy wasn't even  Paying attention  Unfortunately  I'm sorry  I'm reading the  I'm sorry  He said he's pretty  Objective  I thought he was  Going to stop it  Pretty  Like Ali  I'm pretty  Oh I'm objective  Oh thank you  Vince  I'm sorry  But I was just  Reading the  I'm his thing  Yeah I think  The black fans  Have to like  Get a group together  I was thinking  About that  You got the  Passed out west  You got the  Regular pass  You got these  Passed  What walk-in closet  Can they meet in 
[03:24:30]  Exactly  Or maybe not even  A walk-in  Exactly  Hey Vince  Thanks a lot man  Quartet  Yeah  Alright sir  It's nice to have  A rational  Fucking discussion  It really is  And the guy  Wasn't completely  Agreeing with us  Or anything  It's just  It's nice to have  A nice back and forth  And I really believe  Wow the phone's just  They've been doing that  All morning  I mean  People want to talk about this  We just lost everybody  I can't wait to hear  The wiki phone song  On Ron and Fez  Yeah  What's the wiki phone song 
[03:25:00]  Oh it's when the phones break  They play a funny little tune  That one of the listeners  Made for him  That's good  Alright they pop back  I would love to know  How many people called  During our show today  Morris maybe you can do that  For us or whoever's  Working for Morris today  He made a good point  I really do believe  That the women's basketball team  Were brought into  Like an office  And had to be told  Why this is really bad  They were briefed  And I think they fell  Just short  I think they really needed  One of those women  To cry on TV  If they started crying 
[03:25:30]  You got one tear  From the coach  But I think they really  Were going for one of these  Basketball players  To actually just  Break down and cry  And that would have just  Put it over the top  Good night Johnny  Right there  But they couldn't  They didn't get that  They didn't get that moment  Huh?  Did you see in that transcript  Don Imus  Did you read this before  Or if you did earlier  Where it says  When will Al Sharpton  Be apologizing to them  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Talking about that  And then his guest says  I'm unaware of  Such a press conference  And Imus just went 
[03:26:00]  I'll be darned  Like yeah  I can see the sarcasm there  I'm unaware of  Such a press conference  Yeah  I don't think that's  Going to be happening  Against the Duke lacrosse players  I think he's going to  Have to deal with  Some things now  I like seeing him  Getting a little spunk back  I like it  And kind of talking  On the air about this  Good for him  Let's say hi to Mike  In South Carolina  Mike  Hey to Mike  Hey guys  How y'all doing?  Hey what's up?  Hey I just called in 
[03:26:30]  At the Imus Marathon there  And the person I talked to  After I donated the money  Said that they're ahead  Of schedule right now  With their funding  Compared to last year  Because it seems like  Every other person  Calling in  Is a O&A listener  There you go  That's great man  They're very grateful  To y'all  For putting the  The pad data up there  And they're just  They're busy as hell  Right now  See our listeners  Are a bunch of scumbags  But I tell ya  They sure can come  To the table 
[03:27:00]  When need be  They'll blow it somehow  But just not  Oh they will  They'll completely ruin this  I'm sure  Oh yeah  Well I mean  Y'all allow me to  Masturbate about everything  Today  So you gotta give back  Somehow  Yeah  To Jimmy right  Gotta be careful now  Yeah of course  Alright of course  Thank you  See we don't hate  Every radio show  Coke Logic  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  I'm a be pimping  I don't be slippin  When it comes down  To these hoes  I don't love them

[03:28:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  That's alright  Coke Logic  Yeah  With another  Wow  With another diddy  See Imus can get away  With it like that  Yeah  How's a character  Rapping  It's okay if you use  Characters  Yeah  Jimmy what do you got  Over there  I wish Imus had been  A little more annoyed  When he was on  Sharpton's show  Yeah  Because I think  Sharpton is so ripe  To be picked apart  And destroyed  Who's Harold Ford Jr  Imus said 
[03:28:30]  He's been disgraceful  In his lack of support  I endured death threats  To endorse him  It's unfortunate  That he has no courage  Wow  Who's Harold Ford Jr  Is he a congressman  Or something  I really don't know  That is great  To hear Imus  Saying stuff like that  Though  Good  Good for him  And he said  The radio  Is the much bigger  Part of his gig  He said  We have millions  On the radio  Yeah yeah  Absolutely  NBC had a few  In a thousand  So I'm hoping  That radio stays  I'm so hoping  According to Wikipedia  Harold Ford Jr  Is the current chairman  Of the Democratic  Leadership Council  As a former member

[03:40:00]  Is no worse than  What we hear on the radio  Every day  From the music industry  Is that a fair point?  Well that's a fair point  And it really does have to stop  I mean I think  Those people who are  Fortune  Fuck I think we started  The Rappler thing  I know that was pretty obvious  But we hit on it  Very early yesterday  And it's all over the place  Today  Good  Wow  I don't like  Look at us  Being intelligent  That's gotta end  Immediately  Immediately  That was nice of her  To give us a little bit of credit
