<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts' typical vulgar banter, recounting their disastrous Memorial Day weekend party ruined by bad weather, followed by a better Monday. Opie details a rough comedy set by Chip at the Stress Factory and reminisces about a Pocono Mountains trip with his brothers, focusing on an unusual par six golf hole and the decline of the area's large resorts.  They view and discuss photos of abandoned resorts online.  Their Camelback Mountain trip is recounted, featuring their humorous renaming of "Camel Top" to "Camel Toe," Opie's zip line experience, and the contrast between country and city sleeping environments. Opie mentions his mother selling their family timeshare.  A discussion on exotic meats ensues, covering venison, beaver, muskrat, goat, and culminating in a news report about a Chinese restaurant using roadkill. They debate the differences between buffalo and bison meat. Opie describes cutting down trees on his property, leading to a discussion about tree roots. A listener calls in, having eaten ostrich, prompting a final discussion about ostrich anatomy and the unusual Buddha Popcorn shop they visited earlier.

The show continues with a discussion of their $200 spending spree at Popcorn Buddha's, highlighting unusual popcorn flavors like chicken wing and Philly cheesesteak.  They then move on to the overwhelming experience of the M&M's store in Times Square, followed by a discussion of Scott Weiland's breakup and legal battles with the DeLeo brothers of Stone Temple Pilots.  The arrest of a Long Island hot dog vendor with a prostitution conviction is mentioned, along with a news story about in-utero surgery and the last surviving person born in the 1800s, a 116-year-old Japanese man. The Toronto mayor's alleged crack smoking scandal is heavily discussed, including listener calls from Canada.  The HBO Liberace biopic, "Behind the Candelabra," is reviewed with guest Kenny (Club Soda Kenny) providing explicit commentary on its sex scenes and the performances of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.  Ben Mezrich is mentioned as an upcoming guest.

A lengthy segment features a Liberace performance video, with the hosts and possibly Scott Thorson (identified as Liberace's chauffeur) offering explicit commentary on Liberace's flamboyant style. The video showcases Liberace's extravagant lifestyle.  Following this, movie reviews of *The Purge* and *Hangover 3* are given, with guest Roland contributing.  The discussion shifts to Psy's "Gangnam Style" and Sean F's new song "Nagel O'Reilly (Teenage Boy Man)," receiving mostly negative reviews. *Arrested Development*'s revival is mentioned, and a segment follows detailing the "How It's Made" process for various items, including frozen pancakes, violin bows, ravioli, shrimp, bacon, and chocolate. The show concludes this segment with a discussion of Snooki's encounter with Governor Chris Christie, punctuated by offensive language. Jimmy Kimmel plugs an upcoming stand-up show.

The show resumes with a discussion of the arduous chocolate-making process, specifically coating cherries.  The hosts debate waiting for their late guest, Ben Mezrich, ultimately deciding to wait until 10:00 PM. They briefly discuss their new podcast, mentioning Bob Dole and its availability on various podcast platforms, and list other podcasts they enjoy. Gary Coleman's death anniversary is mentioned. Upcoming guests, including Jim Florentine, Dan Marino, Kevin Smith, and Maria Menounos (with a scheduling conflict for Marino), are announced. One host details losses in Google stock options, leading to a discussion of the stock market and a Mariah Carey performance mishap. Ben Mezrich finally arrives for a six-minute interview.

The interview with Ben Mezrich covers his new book, "Straight Flush," detailing the story of frat brothers who built a massive online poker empire and became fugitives. The conversation covers legal battles surrounding online poker, the challenges of writing true crime, research risks, and other books like "Ugly Americans." Mezrich discusses adapting his books into films.  The segment includes a call for merchandise and a question about a Russian card counter from a previous book.  Phil Ivey's poker site situation is briefly discussed, before the interview concludes with promotion of Mezrich's book and upcoming appearances.  The after-show with Sam Roberts and Mezrich is mentioned.  Further discussion of *Straight Flush* details the six college friends who created Absolute Poker in Costa Rica, their million-dollar-a-day profits, and eventual legal ramifications, including a founder serving 14 months in prison.  Mezrich discusses his other books (*Bringing Down the House*, *The Social Network*), the challenges of adapting them into movies, his collaboration with Kevin Spacey and Dana Burnetti, and his research process. He also discusses his family life, his experiences in Las Vegas and Japan, and the differences between regulated and unregulated gambling environments.

[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:04:00]  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  Hey, dang over there.  Don't listen to dang over there.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Hey.  Back after the long weekend, huh? 
[00:04:30]  Yes, our nice Memorial Day holiday weekend.  Our holiday?  Holiday.  With the shitty weather on Saturday for a lot of the Northeast?  Uh, yeah.  What robbery of a holiday weekend.  A holiday weekend.  Friday was terrible, too.  It was awful.  What happened?  Friday was bad, too.  Friday, Saturday, Monday, Wednesday.  Sunday and Monday were good.  Yeah, Monday was the day.  That was the good day yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  Nice and warm.  I got a little sunburned.  I see that.  A little sunburned.  I see that.  Hanging out there in the Yad.  I got a little red-nosed, too, there.  Yeah, see?  A little bit.  You know, it was the first day of actually being able to take in a little sun.  A little sun.  I had a party Saturday.  Saturday.  Travis was there.  Travis and the lovely Teft family.  And, uh, yeah.  The old, uh, aunts and uncles thing. 
[00:05:30]  And some friends.  That was Uncle Tony.  And Keith, the cop, cooking under an umbrella in the freezing cold.  Wow, man.  That sucks.  Yeah, it was just...  You had to do a redo, right?  It was fucking cold.  You did a redo the next day.  Not really.  No.  You didn't do the redo.  Everybody was pretty shot.  Oh, that sucks.  Yeah.  Were there people there?  Yeah, inside.  Oh, no.  Everyone was just hanging out inside.  You couldn't hang out...  Inside next to the fire.  Inside, yeah, right.  Trying to warm up.  Trying to light a fire. 
[00:06:00]  We all went into the jacuzzi.  We did do a jacuzzi thing.  And it was warm in the jacuzzi.  But trying to then get from the jacuzzi back into the house.  And it's cold.  And...  I was just telling you, going from the house to the jacuzzi on a cold day, not a problem,  really.  Kind of fun.  But going from jacuzzi back to the house always sucked.  You're wet.  You're wet and you instantly get freezing.  Instantly cold.  And then you go to wrap a towel around you and the cold...  Now, shorts are like touching areas that don't like cold. 
[00:06:30]  No.  Oh, it was horrible.  Like your taint.  Yes, your taint and your ball bag.  Your upper thighs.  It's just...  It was a terrible...  Weather-wise, just terrible.  But it was...  Yeah, we had fun, obviously.  It was strange how the weather turned around, though, drastically.  There was like a 40-degree difference within the two days.  We had...  And it was fucking windy.  Like crazy wind with the 50-degree temperatures.  Right.  If that.  Right.  Into the upper 40s.  But yeah, then it got... 
[00:07:00]  Yesterday was probably the best day out of all of them.  It was beautiful.  Yes.  I loved it.  The bad weather helped with tickets.  Because people couldn't go down the street.  Nothing to do.  So they just came to the shows.  I loved it.  Tickets, tickets, tickets.  That's all I care about.  Tickets.  Yeah, nobody...  I was fucking so happy.  No beach activities.  Dude, I was hoping for fucking snow.  Jesus.  I wanted...  Just so they could go see Jim Norton.  Just so they were trapped in their houses.  But that was only part of their weekend.  Yeah.  Because they and Jim Norton.  They wanted to get out there and barbecue and do other things, too.  Fuck them.  They have until fucking September now. 
[00:07:30]  Have fun, kids.  Barbecue your cunts off.  Jimmy, very happy that it almost snowed.  Yeah, it helped.  I did enjoy Chip hitting the stage there at the left.  Where was it?  Oh, Stress Factory.  Stress Factory.  Yeah.  Chip hit the stage.  Chip hit the stage and did a fucking line.  A bit of a rough time.  It was so fucking funny.  It had been a...  What happened?  It didn't go particularly well.  This is a bad word to the audience, too.  It's not very nice. 
[00:08:00]  I don't think Chip handled the bombing very well.  I wouldn't say he bombed.  Well, it's volume.  How was the Stress Factory?  Good?  It was great, yeah.  No, it was...  That ain't it.  It was great.  Oh, boy.  Just the fucking...  It was very last minute.  There it is.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now you've done it.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Did you get it? 
[00:08:30]  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Did you get it?  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I gave Chip a sound bully.  Poor Chip.  Aw, Chip.  Trying to spread his comedy wings.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The talking milk...  The talking milk for coffee little thing.  That's just improv-ing.  Yeah, improv-ing.  Chip's great.  It's terrific.  A lot of people hopping on the old vine. 
[00:09:00]  Every day, you see more and more people hopping on there.  The vine is exploding there, huh?  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  Still not available for the Samsung.  Oh, boy.  Galaxy S3.  Soon to become the S4.  Going for the S4 soon.  Soon to get on that.  Still all in with the Samsung.  Oh.  I went up to the old Poconos.  Yeah.  The Pocono region.  Yeah, huh?  Got a lot of...  Champagne glass?  Did you do the champagne glass with the bubbles?  Well, you just beat me to what I was saying. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, damn it.  As I said, I got a lot of tweets from people saying,  Hey, you in the champagne glass with your brothers?  I wasn't near Mount Airy Lodge.  Ah.  Or maybe I was.  I don't know.  I went up to a place called Shawnee Inn.  My lovely wife set up a nice little weekend for me and my two brothers.  A little getaway from it all?  It was awesome, man.  Shawnee Inn was a place we used to go as kids. 
[00:10:00]  My dad got one of those timeshares up there.  When Penn Jillette was talking about the timeshares the other day and how they're a huge scam,  I felt a little awkward because my dad got one of those timeshares.  I think back in the day, it wasn't as bad.  And then at the end, all we had to pay for was the maintenance fees to stay up there for a week.  That's pretty nice.  It was pretty nice.  It was real nice.  It was nice going back there.  Was it...  What kind of recreational activities? 
[00:10:30]  I played a little golf.  A little golf.  A little golf.  How was the course?  Nice?  Yeah.  They have three nine-hole courses that they mix and match.  Oh.  But this is probably too inside.  They have three par fives per side.  Three par fives.  So three par fives in the front nine, three par fives in the back nine.  There's six par fives.  That's a lot.  I like my traditional golf where it's maybe four par fives for a round.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I also like a par five because I'm like, ooh, maybe I'll be able to do this one. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, really?  You like par fives?  I hate par fives.  Are those easy?  Those are kind of like...  No.  They're long.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  They're just long.  They're like 500 plus yards.  Maybe I'll be able to par this one.  And then they had par threes where you've taken out your driver.  I hate those.  This is too inside.  This is golf shit.  But besides that, it was great.  More importantly, we were talking over the weekend how every once in a while you come across a course that decides to be different and they got a par six. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Oh, the par six.  You've never played a par six?  I've never played a par six.  It's their gimmick.  And they have a name for the whole, like, the monster.  And it's a par six.  Everyone talks about it at the bar.  How'd you do on the monster?  But it's stupid.  It's illegal, I think.  Illegal?  Yes.  As far as, like, the PGA and the official rules of golf.  There's one in Idaho.  I'm just looking right now.  There you go.  It's 777 yards. 
[00:12:00]  That's so stupid.  That's just stupid.  There's nothing fun about that.  Got to let it all hang out.  Right.  Grip it and rip it.  Grip it and rip it.  That's right.  They have a great picture of Jackie Gleason.  I guess Jackie Gleason, back in the day, back in 19, I want to say 1953, was up there playing golf with Arnold Palmer.  Ah, the great one.  And they're holding on to that moment ever since.  I bet you Jackie Gleason was there for one afternoon, maybe he was playing a gig in the area, maybe playing a gig at the Shawnee Inn Complex, because, you know, back in the day. 
[00:12:30]  Back in the day.  Those places were huge up there.  Hell yeah.  And they got a picture of him on the first tee with Arnold Palmer.  It's a great picture.  But that picture is duplicated all over the fucking place.  You can't walk around without seeing the Jackie Gleason picture.  Look, he was here.  He was here, see?  Any, like, newer celebrity pictures?  Not really.  That's it.  Not really.  Fucking 1953.  They have one of Bob Hope.  Bob Hope was up there performing.  Hey, yeah, I gotta tell you, I was performing up here. 
[00:13:00]  And I think Eisenhower was up there for something.  No one really of...  I mean, the Catskills and the Poconos used to have those monster fucking resorts, and all the big stars went up there.  That was where everybody went.  And the Rich and Famous used to go up there.  We watched Dirty Dancing.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like the same fucking shit.  My brother was telling me yesterday, I guess most of them, especially in the Catskills, have shut down the big resorts.  Yeah, yeah.  The big hotels and stuff.  And they're just sitting there, just rotting away. 
[00:13:30]  I guess there used to be something like 12 major ones, and now they're down to one or two.  And the rest of them, they just left, and they're just rotting away.  Wow, they just boogied out of there, huh?  And those Urban Explorers, you know, they get in, and supposedly the pictures are amazing.  That'd be kind of cool to see.  They're online somewhere.  I didn't search it out yet, but I got...  Grossingers?  Was that one of the places?  Grossingers.  I think, right?  I'll tell you what hurt them, too, is the casinos.  Those fucking casinos in Connecticut going up.  They're the casino business.  Yeah, there's no reason to go to the Pocono. 
[00:14:00]  If you can just go up here and gamble in Connecticut, why would you go there?  And the Hamptons.  Yeah, the Hamptons.  The Hamptons started developing and becoming a thing.  Grossingers.  Are they still open?  Wow.  We'll have to look open.  Look at that.  Wow, that's cool, though.  The pool is empty, and there's, like, green shit growing in the bottom.  Weeds and stuff.  It's like that sort of useless.  Oh, man.  Wow.  What year did it close?  What year did it grow soon?  I never heard of it.  Oh, God.  I remember hearing of that place.  There were some people that used to go there.  These things must have closed.  1986. 
[00:14:30]  86.  When was it popular?  Okay.  Probably in the fucking, like...  In the 50s?  No, I bet even the 60s and 70s, it was probably...  Yeah, they probably made it to the 70s easily.  It probably started dying out, right?  The ass end of the 70s.  Disco killed it.  Yeah.  Basically.  Did disco kill it?  No, I'm just saying disco.  Anytime something dies in the 70s, I say disco killed it.  Late 70s, early 80s.  Rock Hudson, oh, wait.  Resorts like Grossinger's or the Concord could no longer attract younger guests.  That's what it was.  I don't know about the Concord. 
[00:15:00]  But the older people start dying off.  It's like, once you're...  Well, Swayze wants to dirty dance, and they are offended by it.  No one puts baby in a corner.  Of course not.  Right.  But man, those fucking mountains are relaxing.  I keep thinking I want a beach house.  I think I might want a lake house.  Really?  There's so much more to do.  The lake house.  You could kayak.  You could...  I'm going back in time.  Whoa.  You could kayak.  You could shoot shit.  You could play golf.  Yeah.  All at the same time.  Do some hiking.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, that doesn't look very good.  I would love to stay here.  Where is this?  Abandoned NYC.  Where is this?  This is the Paul G. Hotel.  The Paul G. Hotel.  Needs a good vacuuming.  Yeah, that's...  Needs a paint job.  You've got a moisture problem there that you've got to look into.  I think so.  I love that shit.  Urban exploring, man.  It really is cool.  It's like modern artifacts, you know?  Right.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Well, that's some old room and now there's just plants growing in it? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's been...  What is that?  Down since, what, 86?  It's like the pool room.  It's almost 30 years.  The pool room, yeah, because it's indoors and there's all sorts of plants growing where  plants shouldn't be growing.  That's pretty fucking wild.  I love that shit.  Oh, just relax.  Where's that?  That looks nice.  It's the salon.  The salon.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There's an old Cedars dryer there.  Shit.  Just think of what went on in there.  All the kibitzing.  Right.  A lot of kibitzing, I bet. 
[00:16:30]  That's the entrance?  That's cool.  I've got to check that out.  The highlight...  I don't have many stories from my weekend, but the one thing, we went to Camelback Mountain,  which is...  Camel Toe Mountain.  Camel Toe Mountain.  It's great.  You see the picture?  We made Camel Toe Mountain.  I saw you.  We're fucking idiots.  Because I guess at the top of the mountain, they call it Camel Top.  Oh.  So we noticed you just fucking put an E where that P is.  Yeah.  And boy, the fun ensued.  And the laughs start rolling.  See, now it's welcome to Camel Toe, huh? 
[00:17:00]  Camel Toe.  Get that picture.  We're hilarious.  And I was wondering what these ski resorts were doing to stay in business, because we  haven't had, you know, a winter in a long fucking time around here.  Yeah.  So the skiing has been in trouble for many, many years now.  Man, Camelback Mountain turned it into a fucking water park down below.  Really?  It looks like it's a permanent water park, too.  They cover that shit up during ski season.  And then you could skate. 
[00:17:30]  They do.  People do love their water parks.  And they had the zip line, which we did.  Oh, that's fucking racist.  Come on now.  Anyone could use it.  You go to the top of Camelback, and it's a 4,000 foot zip line all the way to the bottom.  4,000 feet.  4,000 feet.  And you're going over.  We figured it all out.  You're going over 30 miles an hour for over a minute.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  We liked it.  It wasn't.  I didn't find it scary, but I found it pretty damn cool to be just sitting in a seat with 
[00:18:00]  nothing around you and just flying down the zip line.  Yeah, it is pretty cool.  It was awesome, man.  So.  Mm.  Nice getaway.  Yeah, it was a good getaway.  No real stories, just relaxing, sleeping with a window open and not hearing traffic.  That was pretty fucking cool.  Ah, yes.  I have become a fucking city boy.  A country.  God, I forgot that you can actually open a window and sleep with that fresh air without  hearing anything.  It is amazing what you can get used to in New York, you know. 
[00:18:30]  I haven't gotten used to it.  There are people that would just like bolt up awake from hearing that fucking fire engine.  And you're just like, go to sleep.  You could sleep.  Tom Hanks and Big.  Yeah.  My cousin Vinny.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  He sleeps in jail, but he can't sleep in the woods.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  New York City, maybe you could keep your window open for, you might get an hour in before some 
[00:19:00]  nonsense is happening where you're awakened from your slumber, from your golden slumber.  That's pretty fucking cool, though.  Take a little trip up there.  No danger?  No danger?  No getting lost?  No, no.  That's good.  We learned that my mom decided to sell the old timeshare because she didn't want to  pay the maintenance fee anymore.  Even though there's young families in our family now that would have absolutely loved  the free vacation. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Did she tell people she was selling it, like to give them the option to pay it?  No, not really.  No, she was obsessed that she was spending $500 a year or whatever it was.  A year?  That's it, yeah, for the maintenance fees.  Everything else was pretty much paid for.  That's kind of how the timeshares get you.  You have to pay the maintenance fees.  But someone else could have just paid them.  No shit.  Welcome to my world of fucking mental illness without asking anyone. 
[00:20:00]  It is funny, though, how timeshares sound like a great idea.  And then you're like, oh, you've got to pay $500 a year for maintenance fees.  And then you think about it, and it's like, well, I might just be paying that as a hotel  fee anyway.  Right.  So why would I need a time fee?  Well, it's for a week, though.  No, I understand that.  But sometimes the maintenance fees outweigh the cost of what you're going to do.  No, that's how the timeshares get you.  Because you have to pay that maintenance fee, and it doesn't go-  Oh, no, I got it forever.  It's free.  Yeah, it doesn't go toward your investment at all. 
[00:20:30]  And until the maintenance fees, they go up, too, right?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, that's how they get you in the end.  And you've got to go on whatever week they determine is your week.  Yeah.  Yeah, then you're stuck going to the exact same place for years, years in a row.  I'm sure it gets boring.  Yeah, I wouldn't like that.  No.  I'm an adventurer.  Are you?  No.  No.  I'm not at all.  Yeah.  Then we went to that Bushkill Falls up there.  Oh.  You like that nature shit, Anthony?  You know what?  I kind of got put off to that nature shit when I got lost in the woods that time with Melinda. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  That was real nature shit, though.  I'm like, I'm never going hiking again.  No.  Never.  Well, you got the GPS and stuff.  You got all that shit on your phone now.  It'll be a lot easier to find your way now.  That really is amazing now, but don't you still need some kind of signal?  I'm not sure.  Look, this is what I-  Yeah, it was fucking cool, man.  Wow.  They had, you know, these walkways, these wooden walkways along the falls in the middle  of the woods and the woods and zins. 
[00:21:30]  The wooden, is it?  The wooden zins.  Ooh.  Yeah, they have a room full of dead animals.  Yeah, that's like-  I hate seeing a room-  Stuffed animals.  I don't like seeing a room full of dead animals.  They're all toying with each other because they're dead.  They all look cute and like they might still be alive.  It's a hell of a taxidermy exhibit.  Right, but I'm here to tell you they're all dead.  Yeah.  I mean, if you take a still picture, you're thinking, oh, I captured a deer.  Every time I see those scenes, because they're like, they're behind glass. 
[00:22:00]  They're big fucking rooms with a scene.  Right.  A nature scene with stuffed animals in it.  I always think of that scene from fucking Planet of the Apes, where he's running around  the museum and he sees his buddy there just standing there.  Yeah.  Gets shot in the head again.  Look, that wolf is just howling at the moon.  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  It's a little morbid playroom.  It really is.  I hate seeing that shit.  Yeah.  They look just like live boys. 
[00:22:30]  Those kids are having the worst time.  Are those stuffed boys?  They're stuffed boys.  Sure.  This is my favorite place.  There's three stuffed boys outside.  Yeah.  A room full of dead shit.  What's that?  Oh, no.  It's a chipmunk.  What's that?  It's a chipmunk.  Just sitting on a log for eternity.  Forever.  That's it.  That shit creeps me out.  I don't mind seeing if it's just a head on the wall at a restaurant or something, but  the whole animal.  The whole of those probably are, too. 
[00:23:00]  It's been there forever.  And I'll make it very clear.  I don't give a fuck if other people hunt and stuff.  I just know I can't fucking do it.  No, I don't.  I like shooting.  I don't like hunting.  And, man, I mean, I can't even.  We stopped counting after a while the amount of dead deer on the side of the fucking road.  Oh, really?  Oh, God.  Are they just twisted?  And they, holy fuck, that car took out my left leg, and now I have to lay here on the  side of the road until I die.  That's pretty terrible. 
[00:23:30]  Horrible.  Were they spray-painted yet?  We saw so many.  Huh?  Were they spray-painted yet?  The town that I used to live in, in New Jersey, they would spray-paint, like, a red X.  Why?  So that animal control can come pick them up?  Well, I think it's pretty obvious that there's a dead animal there.  You don't need the X.  I think we got one here.  This one's ready.  Oh, he's sleeping.  He's sleeping.  I was disappointed, though.  I didn't see any of the party balloons from the roadkill.  That's a new thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  Get well soon.  They get balloons that say, get well soon. 
[00:24:00]  They attach it to the-  Oh, that's funny, actually.  They attach it onto the little hand of the roadkill guy.  You haven't seen it?  It's kind of a thing that's happening out there.  That's funny.  If there's a balloon store nearby, these sick fucks are getting get well soon balloons,  and they attach it to the hoove.  The hoove.  Of a dead animal.  That's very funny.  Yeah.  Could you find one?  It's pretty easy to find online now.  I was very disappointed I didn't see any get well soon balloons.  Get well soon roadkill. 
[00:24:30]  There's a dead possum.  See how fast that was to find?  That just looks-  Oh, that's so sad.  The little fella.  There's a tinker.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  This is a trend that is sweeping America right now.  It's tied to his leg.  This is horrible.  It's a poor dead deer.  Get well soon.  That's very funny.  Yeah.  We saw a little baby possum on the side of the road, and my brother decided to kind  of nudge it along to get it back in the woods so it wouldn't get hit by a car. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, yeah?  Interfering with the prime directive.  Did I say possum?  Porcupine.  Oh, a porcupine.  Baby porcupine.  I'm like, you're fucking nuts.  Oh, they got those fucking little spikes on them.  Yeah, they do.  The quills.  I got a little video of it.  I'll show you during the break.  It's not worth posting, but it's kind of cool.  Was he going back and forth like this?  He was totally fine, but he was probably a foot from death just hanging out next to the  curb of a sidewalk. 
[00:25:30]  It's like a little walking spike strip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Virginia.  Kevin.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  I just want to let Opie know they've got a full-time position up in the Poconos to remove  dead animals from the side of the road.  I believe it.  I fucking believe it.  Yeah, I believe it.  We saw so many dead deer.  I guess the guy was on his lunch break because we...  We're all over the place.  He could have filled up a whole truck, and then we just started discussing venison. 
[00:26:00]  You ever have venison?  You ever have deer meat?  I have, and I'd rather have fucking beef.  Thank you.  Yeah.  The people out there, now they're going to start calling, oh, it's delicious.  It just hasn't been cooked right.  You don't know how to prepare it.  I've had it for...  I've tried.  ...fucking decades of my life in various incarnations, cooked by different people, prepared differently  each time, and I still, every single time, I'm like, ah, I'd rather have beef.  When I used to live in western New York, and we'd go to the Bills games, and we went to 
[00:26:30]  a lot of Bills games back in the day.  There was always one guy that prepared a nice, heaping crock pot.  Heaping helping.  Of venison chili.  And then the venison grease would be on the top.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the venison fucking taste would be in your mouth.  Here's how you know.  I hated it.  Here's how you fucking know that beef is better.  Because everybody, when they're cooking venison, they're just trying to get it to taste like  beef.  Right.  They're trying to get it to not have that venison-y taste to it. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  So, fuck yourself.  I'll have beef.  I'm sure there's a way to do it where it doesn't taste...  I would have to...  You've got to soak it in buttermilk for a week.  Really?  Do you?  I would have to put it in the gamey category, right?  It is gamey.  Oh, man.  That's why it's gamey.  Venison's terrible.  Yeah, and then...  Yeah, it's awful.  Ted Nugent loves it.  I have venison pie and fucking venison hats.  It shakes, Ted.  Have you ever had it?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's awful.  And then shoots it for the homeless people and the hungry.  Yeah, yeah.  He does that, so at least they're not fucking... 
[00:27:30]  They're getting something.  Yeah, yeah.  They're probably sitting there going,  God damn, I want a steak.  And then, like, someone would bring the homemade beef jerky made from venison  and then have to brag about...  I remember these stories I did yesterday, but this is a long time ago now.  You never hear enough about it, do you?  Oh, it's been hanging in my garage since August.  Let me tell you how I make it.  No.  I don't care.  You bite into this and you're just miserable.  Just wishing you had real beef jerky at that point.  That's great.  It tastes like an animal that rubbed up against some bark. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  Then we were discussing all the shitty stuff we've eaten over the years, and I was telling  him, I finally caught up with Anthony Bourdain's show on CNN.  It's great.  I love it.  Yeah, I haven't seen that one yet.  What is it called?  I always forget the name of the stupid show.  Lost or something?  Abroad or fucking...  Lost Abroad or fucking Eating Abroad.  Eating Abroad would be...  Eating Abroad.  That would be a nice title.  That's funny.  Parts Unknown.  Parts Unknown, right, of course. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, Eating Abroad.  And the Canadian one is really...  It's great, right?  Oh, you saw the Canadian one?  I saw the Canadian one, yeah.  What happens?  He goes to explore and they find someone who beheaded someone on a bus still walking around  the streets because Canada stinks?  He just gets day passes.  He has to go back.  He was hanging with these two renowned French chefs, and the one guy catches beaver.  Did you see the beaver guy in the backyard?  He catches his own beaver, and then he fucking makes something from the beaver, and it was 
[00:29:00]  in like a big pod, and it was hearty.  Hearty is another word for what the fuck is in this.  Yeah.  It was like a hearty brown sauce, and the beaver just looks ugly even after it's cooked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Beaver meat?  It looks like a crooked steak or something.  Yeah, there you go.  What is that?  Let me see it, Travis.  No way.  I don't want it.  And Anthony Bourdain and the other guys were just swearing that this was delicious and 
[00:29:30]  amazing.  I can't imagine eating beaver.  Beaver.  No.  Isolated.  Someone had to fucking name it beaver, didn't they?  Yeah.  So you can't even talk about eating beaver meat.  What are you, a faggot?  You're not going to eat your beaver?  Yeah.  Hey, O.B.  Would you eat beaver?  I mean, that type of beaver?  I'll try it.  Let's get the beaver jokes out of the way, and then let's talk about the real beaver. 
[00:30:00]  Would you eat that shit?  It doesn't look very good.  It beats woodpecker.  That's kind of funny, Chip.  I don't know.  I would try it once.  Why not, man?  It's probably, you know it's not like bad.  I mean, if the guy cooked it right, I would give it a shot.  I'd take it one bite.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I would absolutely try it.  But to actually order it on a menu and say, you know, fuck the chicken, fuck the steak.  Yeah.  Fuck the, you know, the salmon or whatever. 
[00:30:30]  I'm going and having beaver stew.  And they got to present it.  It's like served on his tail with his two big buck teeth sticking in the top like a garnish.  You use them to scoop the rest of the meat onto crackers.  You use his big dumb beaver teeth.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God.  Just a thought.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But the episode, they were gobbling it down, so it must be pretty good.  Yeah.  Then my brother was talking about another restaurant show.  It might have been Kitchen Nightmares or something where there's one restaurant serves muskrat.  Oh, come on.  And the guy, and they were trying to get muskrat off the menu. 
[00:31:00]  And so, you know, change this guy's restaurant around and he refused.  He said, no, man, the locals just love my muskrat dish.  What?  Let me see a muskrat.  It looks like a giant rat.  Yeah.  It's in the rat family.  Is it officially in the rat family?  Oh, my God.  No.  Who would fucking cook in?  That's a disgusting giant fat rat.  Who would prepare that?  I don't want it.  I don't get it.  That has to taste gamey. 
[00:31:30]  But there's guys out there or humans in general that love that gamey taste.  Ew.  What the fuck?  Would you eat that?  No.  Come on.  That guy's fucking around.  You know what?  They eat dog in Asian countries, and it sounds terrible to us, but...  Just because we like them, but they're like, fuck you, dog.  Muskrat's a muskrat.  Yeah, it's pretty gross.  The number one meat consumed in the world is...  Is it dog?  Goat.  It knows.  It is goat by far. 
[00:32:00]  Lots of goats in this fucking...  The savages all eat goats.  Right, because in America, not so much.  It's very hard to find goat meat.  Although we found it where?  Well, they're women's clits out countries.  Right.  They love a good goat.  We were in a restaurant.  Was it in Cleveland?  For your special, I think.  Of the steamers?  Huh?  Yeah.  And they served goat.  And your manager was eating it.  Oh, did he eat goat?  With Stupid Gary.  Both of them...  Stupid Gary.  Stupid Gary and your manager were bonding over goat. 
[00:32:30]  And I guess they both said it was delish.  It probably is good.  It was delish.  I don't know.  I didn't try it.  Thank you, no.  I couldn't eat horse either.  I couldn't eat horse either.  Horse.  God, no.  Horse meat.  God, no.  Sometimes you get Chinese food that has this weird, like if you get like beef and broccoli  or something, it's got this strange horse smell to it.  And I don't even mean like meat, like cooking horse meat, like a stable, like a fucking stable.  It brings up my old story. 
[00:33:00]  When I was living in Northport on Long Island, there was a Chinese restaurant there.  I went and I got a basic dish.  I think it was just like chicken lo mein or something.  Yeah.  And as I'm eating this thing, I'm like, I just knew in my fucking soul I was not eating  chicken.  Oh, boy.  And I only ate a couple bites and I just, I don't know what it was, but I just know it  wasn't chicken.  And fast forward, that restaurant closed down.  So I don't know what the fuck they were doing.  I don't know if the town or the, or the, or the government. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Shut them down.  But there was no doubt in my mind that I wasn't eating chicken that day.  It is a capel.  A rat turd.  It looks sort of, it sort of looked like chicken, but as soon as you put it in your  mouth, you're like, holy fuck, this is not chicken.  But I don't know what it could have been.  What's worse than the gray chicken you get in a Chinese restaurant?  Like I'll eat white meat.  I always ask for white meat, but do you ever like, just get like whatever with gray fucking  just little circles of chicken?  It could either be pigeon or cat or who the fuck knows. 
[00:34:00]  Remember that story?  What was it?  Buffalo?  The horse.  Oh, yeah.  No, it was the deer.  Oh, deer.  Wasn't there blood marks through the restaurant where the guy was dragging it through?  Can you find that old story?  It's one of my favorites that we've done in the last few years.  The guy got caught too, and they shut him down.  Wasn't he the one taking the stuff in the back and stepping on it and then putting it  back in the fucking bowl?  I forgot exactly all the details, but I remember when we read this thing, we were, dare I say, 
[00:34:30]  howling.  We were howling.  Howling.  Oh, with that one.  Here's a guy.  Here's a guy.  As you find that story.  Corey in Winnipeg.  Corey.  Yeah, it's like Corey's on the floor.  I've eaten beaver meat before, and it's greasy, and I know some of my family, they would get  the beaver tail and smoke it, and I tried that.  It's exactly the same texture as a cartilage on the end of a chicken bone, and it's just  fucking good. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, God.  Smoked beaver tail.  What the fuck?  Stop trying to invent new dishes.  We got it figured out.  Yeah.  We got it.  We're done.  We're good.  We know what the tasty animals are now.  Exactly.  We figured it all out.  There was a time, I guess you had to try everything.  Right.  Trial and error.  Right.  That's disgusting tasting.  Don't eat that.  Well, it's our old gag.  I mean, you look at a lobster.  Who was the first idiot that said, this has to be delicious?  Yeah.  But they had.  They had to try everything.  You know how you know they're good?  Because they're so protected with their shells. 
[00:35:30]  Nature knows you're one delicious motherfucker, and once the word gets out, you're finished.  Keep that meat in you.  Yeah.  Crabs, too.  Crabs are fucking fantastic.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yep.  Good crab.  All right, Corey.  Thank you, sir.  Winnipeg checking in.  That's pretty cool, huh?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  It does lead to a story that happened over the weekend.  Bars are serving rubbing alcohol, calling it scotch.  Yeah.  What the fuck bar is this?  This is in Jersey, right?  Oh, wow.  But they're saying this place got caught, but they're saying a lot of places do this. 
[00:36:00]  How did they get caught?  How rubbing alcohol.  You go blind, don't you?  Yeah, they got so desperate that...  Iraq, you got that story?  No.  One of them is right near where I live.  Really?  And yeah, as soon as that story came out and it was on Fox 5 and everything, that parking  lot has been nowhere near what it used to be.  Who's drinking fucking rubbing alcohol with coloring in it and thinking it's scotch?  There's got to be mixed in with something, though, right?  I'm no connoisseur of scotch.  It's that, and they were also taking really shitty liquors and putting them into the top 
[00:36:30]  shelf bottles and passing them off as the real expensive stuff.  Yeah, I figured they were doing that.  That's a pretty bad thing to do.  You get some top shelf shit, and then you just, when those bottles are empty, why get  new ones?  Just fill them up with the cheap shit.  No one's going to know the difference for the most part.  And that's why they make the penalty so fucking drastic.  Right.  It is pretty bad.  I think you'll lose your goddamn license.  Dan in Jersey.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  What's going on? 
[00:37:00]  Dan.  Danny boy!  You got anything else on that rubbing alcohol story?  Hey, you know, if it does the job at the end of the day, who's really at fault here?  Oh, there you go.  If it gets you hammered.  You know, I walked by a bar yesterday.  I saw Bobby and his wife for lunch because I wanted to stay in the house.  Bobby!  Bob Kelly!  And it was nice that.  We just went for a while to get some Thai food, and I'm looking in a bar as I'm walking  by.  It's like three in the afternoon.  I'm like, God, I'm so happy I'm not in there.  Were there guys at the bar just kind of...  Just a couple of people, but I'm like, it just looks... 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, yeah, the regulars.  Like, I can imagine sitting in there and just that fucking feeling of coming out in the  sunlight.  You're loaded already in the afternoon.  Oh!  I kind of like a good local dive bar in the afternoon if there's, like, a dumb game on  and you're just sitting drinking beer.  There was no fun to be had.  There wasn't any fun?  No, it was Memorial Day.  The streets were kind of quiet.  That is true.  Just two or three guys.  The doors open all nice to the...  Yeah, but it was, like, looking into darkness.  See, I kind of like that.  It wasn't looking out.  The goodness of outside wasn't going in. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  It was the badness from inside that was looking out.  It was letting darkness out.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  That sounds like a hoot.  Oh, here's the story.  Should we just play the video?  Sure.  Let's just play the video.  This is the restaurant up in Buffalo.  It's worth taking another look.  What year was this?  A couple years ago at this point?  Five years ago, maybe?  Uh-oh.  This isn't in Buffalo.  Oh, really?  It's in Kentucky.  Yeah, it's in Kentucky.  But it's similar.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is it a fake story that makes its way around the inner tubes?  Yeah, what happened? 
[00:38:30]  Let's see.  Play it.  Let's hear.  Let's know.  I don't think I'll ever eat Chinese food ever again.  I went next door and uptucked everything.  And there was a really weak stomach, and it was just too much for me to handle.  Some former customers of Red Flower Chinese Restaurant are angry about what they say happened  while they were enjoying a Chinese buffet.  A lot of locals eat there, like, on lunch breaks and stuff.  Yeah, it was really disturbing. 
[00:39:00]  There was actually a blood trail that they were mopping up behind the garbage can.  Katie Hopkins says she witnessed employees dragging in a trash bin with a dead carcass inside of it.  There was, like, a tail and, like, a foot and a leg sticking out of the garbage can,  and they wheeled it straight back into the kitchen.  That's when Environmental Health Inspector Paul Lawson was called to check it out.  And when Paul Lawson showed up to the restaurant, what he found inside, he says, is the craziest thing he's ever seen.  On arrival, I confirmed they did have a deer carcass in the facility. 
[00:39:30]  The discovery led to the health department shutting down the restaurant.  The owner tells Lawson that he picked up the deer along I-75.  They said they didn't know they weren't allowed to do that, so that makes me concerned that maybe they could have before.  The owners also tell Lawson that they planned to take the deer home and didn't plan to serve it to customers.  Brittany Pellett, WLKY News. 
[00:40:00]  That's similar to the Buffalo story.  Yeah, the blood trail there.  Right.  I don't know.  You think it's one of those, maybe?  In hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  I mean, tried buffalo meat is coming in.  Yeah, I've tried the buffalo meat.  Again, just give me some beef.  Right, instead of a buffalo burger, you want a beef burger, right?  I know they have beefalo.  What's that place?  Dowd's Beefalo.  Remember that joint there?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I do remember that.  Yeah, they would have the buffalo half steer kind of thing. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  And that was to jazz it up, obviously.  Yeah, it was because regular buffalo is apparently very lean.  I heard that.  So you don't get a good taste from it.  Bison.  Huh?  Bison also is very big.  Oh.  Ted Turner's Restaurant's around the corner.  It's always packed.  It's all bison.  Bison meat?  Yeah.  Is it better than beef?  It's good.  Nothing beats beef.  Isn't bison just a buffalo?  I think it's the same thing, right? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I think it is.  I think it's the same thing, Iraq.  Iraq, what happened?  I don't, I'm not 100% sure on that.  Oh.  They're similar.  Huh?  You should ask your ancestors.  Well, I'd think about it if my mind wasn't toiling trying to come up with an Iraq buffalo joke.  I tried and felt miserable.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How was your weekend, Iraq?  Busy, but good.  Oh, busy. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, busy.  Do tell, writing the script to the movie.  A little more?  That busy?  Getting the, uh, getting the podcasts together?  That, yes.  Oh, nice.  Since it was nice Sunday and yesterday, it was a lot of outdoor work, cutting down trees.  What are you clearing, like the president, when they go out there and clear the land?  Chainsaw?  Do they?  Well, not Obama, but Bush, both the Bushes, Reagan.  Remember those pictures?  You'd see them like, oh, they're on their ranch, clearing the brush. 
[00:42:00]  A lot of brush to clear, apparently.  Yeah, so what were you doing outside?  Trying to cut down trees for the first time.  What were you using?  Your elephant trunk?  See, that was a good one.  I had to.  I had to get back in the game.  Oh, boy.  I struck out and threw out my bag.  I had to get back in there, try to hit a single.  There it is.  Look at Reagan. 
[00:42:30]  He's got a chainsaw.  How does one cut down a tree in your neighborhood?  Well, they're not the huge, like, oak trees.  These are just, like, cherry trees and dogwood trees and stuff.  Yeah.  And just use, I guess it's called an all-saw.  Is that what it is?  An all-saw.  Well, it says tiger saw, but they have another name on it, where you just hold it almost like  a gun.  Oh, Sawzall.  Sawzall.  Thank you.  An all-saw.  Whatever it was.  Sawzall.  You're playing fucking back, words back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why didn't you know what you were playing?  A Sawzall. 
[00:43:00]  Oh.  So that's going on.  It's like pruning.  Right.  How big of a blade?  Did you use the big one-foot blade?  It's nine inches.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, so you had small trees.  You were cutting down.  You've got to cut all the branches off and then try to cut the tree before the stump  and have that fall down on your property.  Oh.  How big diameter of the tree are you talking?  Oh, wow.  That's like six to eight inches.  Like that, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Wow, that's pretty big.  Yeah.  It's a big tree.  About an eight inch diameter tree.  Why are you cutting down trees?  Yeah, what's going on?  I hate when people cut down trees on their property.  I like that shade shit.  It's nice.  Well, there's trees all around the property, but on the property, I want to get rid of them  to open it up.  Oh, fair enough.  I don't want to be the one asshole in the neighborhood if a bad storm hits that my tree takes out all  the wires.  I can't complain.  I ripped out some fucking trees from my property that had to have been there for hundreds of  years.  They were giant, and all they would do is drop shit in my pool and put a shade over the pool 
[00:44:00]  to keep it cold.  I love when people are like, no, the shade over the pool is nice.  That's bullshit.  Because then you're in the pool and it's shit.  What the fuck?  Are you insane?  I want sun on that pool constantly.  Especially if you have those solar heaters, too, for the pool.  Yeah, yeah.  Trees just block everything, and then you spend all that money for nothing.  You're in the pool, and now it's in the shade, so it's 10 degrees colder than it is if the  sun was hitting it.  Those people are assholes.  Constantly clogging up your filter. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, and there's little acorn shells.  Pine needles.  Fuck that noise.  Chop them down.  And then trying to dig up the lawn to take all the roots out.  What?  I didn't realize this when you're yanking a tree out.  The roots are very extensive.  Oh, yeah.  So you're digging up the lawn trying to just cut as much as you possibly can with a saw  and a shovel just trying to get it all out.  And you're going 15, 20 feet away from where the tree was, still digging up the lawn, just  pulling out roots.  You didn't know this.  No. 
[00:45:00]  Thought the tree just grew right out of the ground.  Yeah, what did you think?  A telephone pole?  It's there from one inch into the ground.  I didn't know the roots went out that far.  Depending on the tree, certainly, yes.  Roots will, if you look at a tree and see how far the branches go out from a tree, the  roots go out further than that.  They go out further than the branches of the tree.  Some finding, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're searching for water.  That's right.  Where are you?  Yeah.  Get it away from the sewage pipes, the electrical wiring, the gas, the gas lines that they're 
[00:45:30]  wrapped around.  So you spend your long weekend just cutting trees down?  Trees, bushes.  Manly there.  I'm not good at it, but I'm fine.  You're not good at it?  Were you wearing any safety equipment?  Goggles?  Yeah, I had the goggles.  I had gloves.  Oh.  Why didn't you fucking tweet or vine anything?  Exactly.  Nothing fell and hit me.  Love to see you fucking vine your finger being chopped off.  It could have been a lot of people commenting on your photos, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  Let me say hi to Vinny in Jersey.  Vinny!  Hey, yeah?  Hello!  What's up, Vinny?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Good morning.  I've been out to Lancaster, PA, and had ostrich.  It's red meat, and it was delicious, just like a steak.  I gotta say, my sister used to work at a joint on Jericho Turnpike.  Suspiciously, the whole place burned down.  Yeah.  But who am I to say?  My sister was out of work.  Jewish Lightning?  I don't know.  But they served ostrich, and I loved it.  Yeah.  It was delicious. 
[00:46:30]  Sitting next to them?  Oh.  See, I thought.  I loved it.  It was kind of like a lamb chopped meats of steak, I think.  Really?  Right?  It was delicious.  It was unbelievable how good it was.  That I liked.  Yeah, I tried that.  That was probably the most outrageous thing I've ever tried, I think.  That's kind of a bird.  What ostrich farms around I've seen?  Yeah.  Where the fuck do they get the meat?  Ostrich?  Yeah.  I would assume that middle part's all fatty shit. 
[00:47:00]  That breast, though, is probably pretty big.  You think?  And then the legs, right?  Maybe that one muscle.  They've got that giant fucking drumstick, like Fred Flintstones.  Yeah, I don't know where they get the actual meat, what part of the animal.  I would think the breast has got to be huge on those fucking things.  It can't be the legs or head or neck, because that's all just fucking skinny.  It's got to be that big fucking hook of fish.  No, the upper leg is pretty fucking impressive.  Yeah, they're like, let's take a look at the ostrich.  Let's see what part we do.  Well, when I petted an ostrich, I noticed that it was all, when the ostrich and I bonded.  That's right.  Yeah, look at that thing. 
[00:47:30]  That's fucking a giant drumstick.  All right, no, you're not eating that leg.  Look.  Look at his neck.  No fucking way are you eating that leg.  Dude, look at it.  It goes up.  It's a giant drumstick.  That's all solid muscle, though.  And cartilage.  No.  Yeah, you want to eat that fucking solid muscle.  That's not like, chickens are all fat.  It's all fucking juicy and fat.  That's all muscle.  Does anyone know where they get the ostrich meat?  It's got to be under the feathers somewhere.  By the asshole.  I think that's where they do it.  Well, safe to say it's under the feathers somewhere, but what part?  An inch around the asshole, that's apparently delicious. 
[00:48:00]  The rest of it is terrible.  I bet you most of it you got to throw away.  You're right.  One fucking steak out of it.  Yeah.  And then the neck.  One filet.  A little neck.  Neck.  His nibble on the neck.  No?  No.  It's got a lot of it.  Who knows this shit?  I need to know now.  That breast is huge, though.  Look.  I bet that's like fucking.  What about the back?  The back meat would probably be horrendous.  Oh, yeah.  Anything near that weird ass of it is, I don't think you would eat that shit. 
[00:48:30]  What a dumb dinosaur looking bird that is.  Oh, that would peck the shit out of you if you got in his way, too.  No kidding.  Oh, he'd give you a fucking pecking.  Oh, this dumb backwards kneecap.  Yeah, it's so weird, right?  I don't know.  They're fast, aren't they?  Yeah, they're pretty fast.  They kind of run silly.  Like a motor.  They got that back and forth thing going on.  They'll fuck you up.  They kick you, too.  I forget how an ostrich gets in your shit, but if they're really annoyed, they let you  know it.  Yeah, I hear they're nasty, nasty animals.  Not when you befriend them like I did.  I happen to be very good with the animal community, but a lot of people probably aren't. 
[00:49:00]  They walk up and just slap at them.  Oh, terrible.  I gave him, he was eating dog food.  Little dog niblets.  Really?  Yeah, I held my hand out, and he was pecking away.  Where was this?  On Leno once.  Oh, right.  He was the animal guy.  An animal thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just held my hand out, and he was like, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck.  Peck away, peck, peck, peck, peck.  Oh, I forgot one other thing from my trip with my brothers.  We spent well over $100 on popcorn.  What? 
[00:49:30]  There's a popcorn shop up there.  It's brilliant.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking brilliant, though.  How do you spend $100, though?  They have a million different flavored popcorns.  Oh.  And you think to yourself, God, that's an idea I easily could have came up with.  Fuck.  That sounds like such a failure.  It just sounds like a failure.  I'm going to open up a popcorn shop.  They even have a room where you could look into them making it in these big vats.  What are some of the flavors?  What are some of the flavors?  They had Philly cheesesteak. 
[00:50:00]  They had mac and cheese.  What's on Philly cheesesteak?  Is it meat on it?  No.  It's just the flavoring they use.  They had all that chocolate shit, dark chocolate, sea salt caramel.  It was pretty terrific.  Sea salt, just all the popular craze right now.  Then they had all their summer flavors in a bag, which is all different colors, and so it's like lime and lemon and, I don't know, all those fucking summer-type flavors.  It's called Buddha Popcorn.  Look it up.  Buddha Popcorn. 
[00:50:30]  Why?  What did the popcorn do wrong?  I just gave them massive fucking business, by the way, because they got an online business.  Oh.  They're going to be wondering why they're getting a lot of orders today.  Fucking tell them Opie and Anthony sent you.  Fuck it.  Maybe they could send us some free shit.  They got the flavors online, so I'm trying to remember all the flavors.  There were hundreds.  Buttery, low-salt cheese.  These are the boring ones.  White cheddar, ranch, sour cream, and jives, salt and vinegar. 
[00:51:00]  Salt and vinegar and popcorn.  That sounds good, right?  Yes.  That's also known as the douche popcorn.  Loaded baked potato popcorn.  What about?  The nacho.  Where's the caramel?  Oh.  You got that?  Like Cracker Jacks?  There you go.  Strawberry cheesesteak.  Fucking birthday cake, Oreo cookie, fucking popcorn.  Strawberry cheesesteak or cake?  Cake.  Oh, I think you said strawberry cheesesteak.  I might have.  Venison.  I might have.  I'm still tired.  Coconut cream pie, PB&J, fucking popcorn. 
[00:51:30]  We tried a whole bunch of them.  They were all good, too.  That's crazy.  Cray-cray.  Dark chocolate.  Peanut butter chocolate.  Butterfinger.  Spresso.  I've got an idea.  I'm going to take a popcorn.  I'm going to make popcorn, but it's going to be a specialty.  Yeah.  I would be like, oh, yeah, sure.  Take a hike.  We've only seen a couple different flavors in our lifetime, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe a little white cheddar popcorn and maybe what?  Ooh. 
[00:52:00]  What?  Exactly.  White cheddar.  Bubblegum popcorn.  I'll tell you what I'm sick of is kettle corn.  Oh, fuck the kettle corn.  You don't like some kettle corn?  No.  Fuck it right.  It's asshole.  Oh, it's terrible.  I hate kettle corn stores.  You want to grab a little kettle corn?  No, I don't.  Kettle corn.  I'd rather grab a hornet nest than a fucking bag of kettle corn.  Red hot cinnamon popcorn.  The flavors go on and on here.  I don't know. 
[00:52:30]  They had a lot of food flavorings, like I said, Philly Cheesesteak and chicken wings.  Chicken wings popcorn.  Yeah, they had some kind of hot sauce slash chicken wing tasting popcorn.  Peculiar.  But you know what?  We went in there as a goof, tried a couple samples.  Next thing you know, we're walking out.  It probably was close to $200.  Jesus Christ.  Some racket.  On popcorn.  You got a popcorn racket.  And then I said, you should go on Shark Tank. 
[00:53:00]  And they're like, fuck those people.  We're not giving them a slice of our business.  We know what we're doing.  We don't need them.  We'll give you $100,000 for 90% of your business.  They're like, we'll go in there just to tell them no thank you.  Go fuck off.  So.  Gee.  But it's in the middle of nowhere.  I'm like, if you were in a real fucking place.  Times Square.  You would sell a ridiculous amount of this shit.  Right?  Times Square.  Hell yeah.  Times Square.  You could sell it for like $30 a bag.  Have you been in the M&M store? 
[00:53:30]  I know if I go in there, I make a complete piece of shit out of myself, so I won't go.  It's kind of fun.  They have a lot of different M&Ms.  Oh my God.  The tourists love that place.  They're snapping pictures of the sign.  I go in there every once in a while.  Like if I'm having a party or something with a bunch of kids, I'll go over there and fancy  it up for them.  You buy a lot of candy there.  Fuck.  It's all different colors of M&Ms and you mix and match.  So if you got your favorite football team, you pick your fucking team colors.  Ooh.  All that shit.  Goddamn M&Ms.  I'm so hungry.  I don't even remember how many they had.  I'm sorry.  They had all those long tubes with everyone in a different fucking color. 
[00:54:00]  How great is putting your hand in a giant bowl of M&Ms.  Just shove the whole fucking handful in your mouth.  Nice peanut M&Ms.  No.  Fuck it.  I love them too.  The chocolate ones bother me.  Oh, peanuts.  If I eat too many chocolate ones, it gives my mouth a fucking weird feeling.  Like I don't know my throat.  There's something about all the chocolate bothers my throat.  The fact that it's not.  Just cum.  Goddamn it.  Goddamn it.  I was right behind you.  The palate doesn't recognize the delicious chocolate flavor. 
[00:54:30]  It's just always.  But it certainly recognizes other.  That palate has been tainted.  Tainted.  Literally.  You try the pretzel covered M&Ms?  Yes.  That's shit.  Hit.  A hit.  Yeah, yeah.  A fucking hit.  But pretzel with anything was good.  I would eat pretzel with fucking.  I would eat pretzel with fucking deer brain.  Ooh.  Pretzel with anything is delicious.  Mustard.  Yeah.  Give me some fucking mustard to pretzel. 
[00:55:00]  That damn popcorn place fucking destroyed us on the way out yesterday.  Well, yeah.  Mustard.  He loves you, though.  I'm a creep.  Do you like that, right?  I go on pretzel.  You don't like that?  No.  He loves you, though.  He writes me all the time.  When can I come back?  I'm like, well, I got to work on Anthony still.  No, I haven't been on it.  We got to turn Anthony around.  I like the guy.  We got to turn Anthony around and he'll be back.  It's just not my cup of tea. 
[00:55:30]  Got to turn Anthony around a little bit.  Yeah.  You don't like that version?  Jesus.  It's terrible.  This isn't a franchise.  Oh, no, I don't think they're a franchise, Nick and Indy.  Nick?  Yeah, how you doing today, guys?  Popcorn Buddha's a franchise?  I don't think so.  Yeah, Buddha popcorn.  Why would the popcorn do?  It's called Buddha Popcorn USA.  Cheering.  It's out of Strasburg, Pennsylvania.  You know what their tagline is? 
[00:56:00]  It is the Enlightened Snack.  Yeah, okay.  That's the place I was at.  I was in Stroudsburg or just outside.  I don't know where the fuck it was.  A franchise?  So they're franchised.  Well, this guy's from Indy.  Go to the bottom of the page a minute.  Yeah.  They're going to be all over.  I mean, they're not out west yet, but they are mostly in the northeast.  But they are franchises.  And they've been at that store a year and a half and it's a family business.  And they got to be worth a shitload of money because I've never seen this one before. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I've seen a couple different popcorns, but nothing like what they're doing.  Very good.  They're moving some corn.  They're moving it.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  We should break.  I was waiting for our food.  Yeah, I know.  I'm starving.  I ate two things yesterday and I fucking woke up at three and I'm just having coffee late like with Bobby and his wife.  Why would you do that knowing you have trouble sleeping?  No coffee late if you want to sleep. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, my gosh.  We got Snooki being very cunty to Governor Christie after the break.  There's some great female celebrities in the news shit going on.  Amanda.  Amanda.  Amanda.  Baines.  Is that how you say your name there, Sam Roberts?  Bines.  Bines.  She is fantastic.  Do you follow her on the Twitter? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  You have to.  You have to.  This is one of those like Charlie Sheen meltdowns where you've got to.  Did she say that shit though?  She's saying that people made that up, but she didn't say anything about Rihanna.  She's crazy.  I think she said everything.  I think so, too.  And I don't think the cop was patting her pussy either.  No, because now she's trying to say that the cops groped her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, patting her pussy reminds me of a character I used to read when I was a boy.  Patting her pussy.  So you got it?  Yes.  Yeah, we got it.  Yes.  Yes.  Tired. 
[00:58:00]  It's going to be a long show.  We got a great clip of the Toronto mayor saying he doesn't smoke crack.  Oh.  And we also have other things to do today.  Thanks.  No guess, right?  Yeah, Ben Mesrich.  Oh, fuck.  That's a terrible reaction.  I mean, cool.  No, first day back, I like just to hang sometimes.  That's it.  Ben Mesrich going to come in and hang.  Fuck.  That's right.  What's this book about?  I don't know.  I bet you're playing cards.  Another book that they'll make into a big movie that they'll change the title of so he doesn't 
[00:58:30]  get any.  He gets money, but he doesn't like.  He gets a taste.  He gets a good taste.  Now, his books are great.  What is it now?  I've read a bunch of them.  Like a fucking Tiddlywinks fucking group?  Yeah, how they went to Tiddlywinks town and stole $8 billion from the movie.  The Tiddlywinks shark.  Jacks.  They would play jacks in the schoolyard.  What year is this?  Did you ever play jacks?  I used to play jacks when I was a kid.  Did you?  I enjoyed a good game of jacks.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  That was totally a girl's game.  I enjoyed a good game of jacks. 
[00:59:00]  I did.  I was good.  I was trying to scoop up all the jacks.  Yeah.  Onesies, twosies.  I had a couple sisters, so I think I played it as a goof, but I didn't like it or anything.  What did you have to do?  You had to bounce the ball and grab one, right?  Yeah.  Right.  And then you had to catch the ball in the hand with the one jack in it.  I think so, yeah.  Then you bounce it again and you had to grab two.  Right.  But I think you had to keep the jacks still in your hand that you already caught, I think.  And you can't drop the jacks.  Who fucking...  When was the last time jacks was played by anybody? 
[00:59:30]  I played it recently.  No, you didn't.  I have jacks parties.  My friends come over.  We play jacks on a Friday.  It's different.  There's a cracker in the middle.  Oh, shit.  That was a rowdy, Rock.  Yeah, you're a sorry.  I can't imagine eating beaver.  You're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  And now back to The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. 
[01:00:00]  I got a picture of a photograph  Of a wedding in a shell  It's just a burning ancient memory  I never kiss and tell  So tell me I've been running  There's a hole in your head  There's a hole in your head  Where the birds can't sing along 
[01:00:30]  Well, this band is in turmoil, huh?  A little bit, huh?  I saw them less than a year ago in Huntington  Had a great time.  The band sounded awesome.  It looked like they were getting along.  Stone Temple Pilots.  STP!  And we all knew 
[01:01:00]  If you know anything about this band  It was just a matter of time  Yeah  They broke up again  They've gone their separate ways  Scott Weiland's doing a solo thing  And I hear it's doing pretty well  But they're angry at him, huh?  The DeLeo brothers  And I always forget the drummer's name  And they're  So does everybody else  They're pretty much suing Scott Weiland  For misusing band's name and songs  During his solo tour  How could  That's kind of fucked up 
[01:01:30]  To me, STP is Scott Weiland  Yeah  I mean, the DeLeo brothers certainly are  Very talented musicians  But  You know  Both  Let both of them use the name  You know  If you're too dumb to fucking show up  And not know who the hell's gonna be playing  Right  What?  I thought  Wait a minute  Yeah  He doesn't look good  Do you know what it's supposed to do?  Bruce?  Fox News  He looked bloated  Or something  He looked chubby in the face  He did, right? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, a little bit  Might have been a bad angle or something  Yeah, probably  So  Don't get Roland in here on you  So obviously they had another bad breakup  And now they're trying to make it hurt  Yeah  That guy can't get along with the band  He just can't get along with the band  Oh, he's an asshole, obviously  What a douchebag  He's a typical old school rock star  But  Yeah  With that said though  His sound  His voice is STP  Mm-hmm  Such a distinct voice  Yeah, good luck  Getting another singer that sounds like that 
[01:02:30]  I mean, they've done pretty well in the past, haven't they?  Who?  Without Scott Weiland  No  STP, no?  No  Like on tour?  No, they haven't  What do you mean?  Haven't they gone out and played some of their shows?  Without Scott Weiland?  Yeah  No  No?  They went out with Cab Calloway  No, I mean  Cab Calloway?  I mean, no as in  They haven't been successful  No  No  They couldn't wait to get back together with Scott Weiland  And they got back together  They lasted, it seems like, two plus years  Where they sort of were getting along and getting it done 
[01:03:00]  Did they do a new record?  I don't know  With him they didn't  Huh?  They didn't do one with him  A new record album  They got a new song with the dude from Linkin Park  I don't know if it's a whole record, I have no idea  But they didn't do one with Weiland though  They just did old stuff?  Pretty much, yeah  Right?  Yeah  I'm a little behind on my STP knowledge  Yeah, I don't think they came out with new stuff  Maybe a new song, but that was about it probably  No one wants to hear the new stuff  No  We just want to hear the old hits  And people are trying to turn me on to Alice in Chains without Lane Staley 
[01:03:30]  And they're like, no man, you gotta give them a try  No, how about no?  I loved Lane Staley's voice  Loved it  And it was all good for the time and everything  I don't know  But they're saying this new song is great  This new album they put together is great  Get into Alice in Chains all over again?  Nah  I'm not gonna do it  There's plenty of old stuff that's still worth playing  That Unplugged is still one of my favorite things to pop on  Yeah  Still one of my favorites, but  It's one of the best Unplugs  I think so  Unplugged ever 
[01:04:00]  Ever  So you got the STP suing Scott Weiland  For misusing band's name and songs during his solo tour  Oh God  Can we all just get along?  No  Apparently not  Remember the hot dog hooker?  Yeah, she was out there on what, Long Island?  Yeah  Yeah  Just a slob  She was disgusting  We know the hot dog trucks on Long Island  Did we talk to her?  I don't know  I thought we did  We might have  But they set up shop and then this one lady decided 
[01:04:30]  Might as well  Some are saying she might have done a couple things in the truck  In between serving the hot dogs  Remember her?  Yeah, yeah  She was also  It was last year it all went down  Oh was that?  And she would give news interviews  And just curse  Oh, she was  She was great  Talk about her tits  Yeah, she was great  She's a great girl  But she kind of skated  And then, you know, went back to serving up the hot dogs  And she's been arrested again for prostitution 
[01:05:00]  Nassau County Police have once again arrested the woman  Who was convicted last year for offering services as a prostitute  From her hot dog vending truck  She's only 47  Katharina Scalia, right?  Of East Rockaway  Drove her vending truck to a hotel in East Garden City on Friday  Where she offered to engage in a sexual act with an undercover officer  She is a dummy  Scalia offered to perform the sexual act for an undetermined amount of money 
[01:05:30]  According to authorities  She was arraigned on Saturday on prostitution charges  So she's, uh, she's in, uh  Back in the slam  She's in trouble again  Yeah, good for her  Boy, that's what Long Island's all about  Hot dog trucks and fucking horrid prostitutes  Oh, those hot dog trucks  You would get a good, nice little fucking  Oh, they were great for a quick lunch  A couple dogs  They're on the job, you know  The regular Joe  Regular Joes  A lot of regular Joes  Regular Joes love them 
[01:06:00]  I walk over, I get a hot dog and a soda  I don't muck around  I got the old lady at home  You do what you do in the truck  You just give me a couple of dogs  I'm gonna go back to work  You don't get paid to flirt around in there  You get paid to work  Regular Joe  Yeah, those hot dogs are usually fucking pretty goddamn good  God, I want a hot dog, I'm so hungry  Yeah  They just showed up  I hate that we don't have the sound on the TV  But we have to do our show  I'm seeing it  The audience hates that too 
[01:06:30]  They showed a video just now  Where they're doing surgery on a newborn  Yeah  But I think it was still in the mom  In the womb  Yeah, I read about that over the weekend  Yeah  Oh, so that's what was going on there?  Yeah, they're doing in utero fucking surgery  Fixing shit up while they're still in there  Yes  So they cut open the belly  They had all the, like the  I call it tarps  Tarps around  So I didn't know where the baby was  Yeah  But it looked like, yeah  Still in the mom's belly  And they were doing some  What were they working on?  I don't know  It's like laparoscopic though 
[01:07:00]  They go in, like, with those instruments  No, this was wide open  Oh, she was laid open?  You saw the whole baby  No way, really?  That's why I don't know if the baby was still in the mom or not  That looked really freaky  It looked like it was though  That's fucked up  I didn't see the one where it was laid open  No, this one was wide open  You could see most of the baby  That's why I'm wondering what that was about  Yeah  But the tarps were around  So I wasn't sure if the baby was still in the mom  Or it was already born  And that's just, you know, had it on the operating table 
[01:07:30]  No, I don't think it was already born  Because the baby was moving around  While they were operating  Yeah, I don't think they would do that though  Cut it with the mother open  They just showed the video on CNN  I need to know what that was  We need to know what it was then  If anyone else just saw that  Please give us a call  Yikes  Thank you  Creepy  Just a weird fact that hit the news  There's only one man born in the 1800s  That is still alive  We're down to the last guy 
[01:08:00]  The last guy  That was born in the 1800s  Obviously it would be the late 1800s  But there's one left  There's some bitches left  There's 21 bitches  21 bitches and one man  So 22 people that were born in the 1800s  Still remain  He's 116  And this is  I read about him yesterday  He worked in the fucking Japanese post office  For 45 years  And retired at age 65  In 1962  He's still alive  Dude, 1962  When the British invasion 
[01:08:30]  Hit the US around there  That's when he was done with his working life  And he's been around ever since  God, I wonder what he does  Hopefully he took up golf or something  He spends a lot of time in bed  And then small portions of food  Little light Japanese guy  Let me see his picture, Sam  116  Damn  But he's the last guy born in the 1800s  That still remains  He lives with his  One of the people he lives with  Is his son's widow  Right  Or no  Yeah, the woman who was married to his son  Who's dead  She's 89 
[01:09:00]  Imagine your 90-year-old ex-daughter-in-law  Oh my god  That's fucking  Where do you put the blue dot for this guy  From that stupid commercial  Was there a place for that?  I hate that commercial  What is it for?  I don't even know  You've seen it  Yeah  Oh, okay  I don't know what it's for though  Where we all have to take our blue dots  And put it where the oldest relative  Yeah  They think that there's more of them around  But that's the only one who like  Documented or whatever 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, the birth certificate kind of matches up  To what they need to say yes  This is accurate  Yeah, birth records back then  You know  A little shoddy  A little shoddy, you think  But we got 21 bitches left  Yeah  Where are many of these people?  Are any of them as old as him though?  No, he's the oldest person in the world  He's the oldest person alive  There's a 115-year-old woman, I think  What do they call them?  Super genarians?  Super centurions?  There's nothing super about it  Centurion  I think it's  Yeah  Genarian  It's also known as  Pants shitter extraordinaire 
[01:10:00]  Yeah  I wonder if he can walk  Or if he can shit by himself  I doubt  I don't know, man  That's really taking the body  To the limit right there  It is, right?  Phew  Those dried up organs  But you wait  It won't  Fucking  By the time we're dying  This generation  There'll be a whole bunch  Of them living to be  115, 120  Oh, they say that, yeah  They say most kids born today  Are going to make it to 100  Yeah  I'm going to make 100  If I don't kill myself  Before I'm 50  I'll live to be 100  Oh, look at him 
[01:10:30]  Jeez  Is that the same guy?  He looks like Uncle Junior  A little bit  He doesn't look that bad  For 116  That's a recent picture?  Fuck  Are you  Wow  What the fuck?  Any older pictures  That you could tell  He's younger in  Would be like  With fucking  Horse-drawn characters  Exactly  He's high-fiving Hitler  Fucking  But he's got one of those  Big things on the side  Of his head  That old people get  Where?  A goiter?  I don't know  A fist marker 
[01:11:00]  It's just a big thing  A big bruisey thing  Oh, it's a big dark  Fucking spot  On the side of his head  He was 48  When the Japanese surrendered  In World War II  Fucking 48 years old  And this  And like  Since that time  Like he's lived  It's fucking  Mind-boggling  How old this dude is  116  Wow  He's probably had it  You wonder if you get  Scared to death  At that age  When you've lived  116 years  Is there anything that you  Or are you just 
[01:11:30]  Completely ready to go?  I would assume  You're ready to go  Yeah, you have to be  I guess  I don't think  I don't know  Do you think that's  What fucking resurrection is  When we can kind of  Come back and get people  Who died?  Maybe that's what  Resurrection is  Resurrection?  When science figures out  What DNA really is  And like  Every thought  And every feeling  You've ever had  Is trapped in any piece  Of your DNA  So all we have to do  Is get a little bit  Of your DNA  And we can resurrect you  So maybe that's what  Maybe that's what  The Bible's talking about  Or alien resurrection  That's pretty much 
[01:12:00]  What that was  What's that?  Well they got a little  Ripley DNA, right?  And then they clone her  And they kind of got  Because she had  That alien in her  At that point  And they cloned her  After she killed herself  But now they got  A DNA of Ripley  And the alien  Wow  So they cloned it  And she was mostly Ripley  But she had some alien shit  Going on in her  But then she had these  Like kind of memories  And shit  And thoughts from  The old herd  And stuff  I like that one  Imagine you're dead  For a long, long time 
[01:12:30]  And then out of nowhere  You're awake again  Because of science  I bet it would just seem  Like two seconds though  It's like any other sleep  You'd just wake up  And you're like  Oh  You'd be so confused  Like what the fuck  I gotta go through this shit again  People that wake up  From comas  Are like  20 years  20 years later  Yeah those stories  Are always creepy  But that's judgment day maybe  That's why  Maybe like Hitler  They won't bring back  Mussolini  They won't bring back  Come on  A lot of people  They won't bring back  Killjoys  Yeah  So maybe that's  What judgment day is 
[01:13:00]  That's my theory  Oh  I like it  I like your new  Judgment day is not  Huh  Is that your religion  Yeah  Yeah  The guy has  The answer to the CNN video  Jeff  Yeah  The baby was flushed  Down the toilet  Oh  Is that the toilet baby  Yeah  Yeah that was in China  And it wasn't flushed  Down the toilet  It was some  In East China  Some squat toilet  With a pipe  That just goes down  Oh they were breaking 
[01:13:30]  Open the pipe  Yeah  And they  No they cut  They cut the pipe  Okay  And brought the pipe  To the hospital  And got the kid  Out at the hospital  Oh the kid  Fell in by mistake  Or might have been  Thrown in by his mom  Yeah  Huh  Look at that toilet  It's somewhere  In the Chang  Phuong province  Is the baby  Is the baby alive  Holy fuck  Are you serious  That's what we just saw  Yeah there you go  Oh my god  I heard that story  Wait so the  The baby  What  The baby's in that pipe

[01:14:30]  For the parents  They say no one  Shit pipe  Has yet come forward  To claim the child  Holy  Upside down  Like that in a pipe  But they  They  They saved it  Kid leaves one stink hole  To fall right into another  Wow  That's pretty fucked up  That's a fucked up story  As they're opening up the pipe  There's the baby  Moving its head back and forth  Upside down in a pipe  And they were able  To survive that  I guess  It wasn't in the pipe  Too long  About an hour I guess 
[01:15:00]  They knew right away  I guess  That they went down  Huh  That fucking China  Yeah they're a superpower  And all  And they got some great shit  And they got fucking  A bustling economy  And everything  But man  So many of their people  When you still have  The old squatting shit  Tub  Like that  Ah  Hmm  Yeah it's some fucking  Far away east China  Place  Right  Well  Well good for them  How did they fucking 
[01:15:30]  Know the baby was in there  I don't know  Someone went to take a shit  And was like  Yeah do we know more about this  No  How do you  How do you discover  There's a baby in a pipe  I don't know  Cause obviously  The people that put the baby  In the pipe  Aren't sticking around  I think barely fit in there  Nah man  It's a small pipe  Really bizarre  I guess bigger than a vagina though  Chinese vagina too  Some of those vaginas  Are big out there  Sideways  That old gag 
[01:16:00]  Sideways vagina  Well let's talk to Canada  For a second  Toronto  Toronto has a mayor  Some say  The video shows him  Smoking crack  And  He finally spoke out about it  Did he  Oh yeah he did  You think he's smoking crack  I don't know  I say he's smoking crack  Smoking the crack  What kind of evidence  Is there against him  There's a video that  Looks like it's him  Yeah

[01:29:00]  It's just that  They stamped it wrong  Yeah  They make those mistakes  They're bad at that  The year  The year is different up there  Yeah  It was actually  Our 2011  Yeah  Yeah  They were in 2012 up there  It's just weird  How that works out  Holy fuck  Well you should have said  She was suicidal  Look  She was going through a depression  She was really suicidal  Is that what you would have used  I went up and saw  Yeah  I mean she would 
[01:29:30]  Look what was I going to do  I mean I don't have any  Physical traction for her anymore  Why didn't I tell her  Why didn't I say  Hey I'm going up to Halifax  Because I figured  Turn it around on her  And go  You know I would have told you  But you're so fucking crazy  And then it would have been  Oh I turned it around  And put it right up  Back on her  I just didn't want to start  A fight about it  It was like I didn't know  What to do  It was like you know  I didn't want to go up there  But it's like you know  All of a sudden  Something terrible happens  I'm like why didn't I go up there  That's a big lie  Yes it certainly is  Well it's a big situation  That's a big fat lie  Well so is going there  You're not into the big fat lies 
[01:30:00]  I don't like getting into  The big fat lies  No they really bring things  To a whole new level  They certainly will snowball on you  Yeah  Well if you're lucky  You're snowballing  The Toronto mayor  Has also been arrested  For DUIs over the years  Oh yeah  And I'm also hearing  There's a video of him  Falling into the camera  Really  All our Toronto friends  Are checking in  And then we got this guy  In Paul saying  The media is out to get him  Why is the media out  To get the mayor of Toronto 
[01:30:30]  Really  They have a very different media  Than we have here in the states  I don't believe that sir  Well I'll tell you  They're a very liberal media  In Toronto  Oh much different  And he's a very conservative mayor  And honestly  Everything that he said  He was going to do  When he campaigned  He did  You know  Removing taxes  From automobiles  Bag taxes  From grocery stores  Things like that  And they are just  Out to screw him  Because he 
[01:31:00]  He stands up to them  He doesn't take their crap  And they just can't handle it  So the thing  I don't understand  Is where's the video  They keep saying  They want six figures  Or two hundred thousand  Why can't the Toronto Star  Pony up  A couple hundred thousand bucks  To get an actual video  Of the mayor smoking crack  Well supposedly  Gawker paid the money  But now they can't find  The guy that has the video  Ah see  Exactly  So it's  You know  The Toronto Star  They just  They want  They want this guy out 
[01:31:30]  And if it wasn't this  There was the scandal  Of using  City Hall  Letterhead  When he was coaching  This little football team  So he was using his  You know  Cloud as mayor  To get donations  Not taking anything  Out of the city  And they went after him  For that  And it was like  Fifteen hundred dollars  Worth of letterhead  From the city of Toronto  You know  They're just basically  Out to get the guy  As far as I'm concerned  I'm not saying he's an angel  He's definitely got some past  But  You had to say 
[01:32:00]  Out to get him  Out  Out  Out  Where's that come from  Alright Paul  You're the only one  Calling in to  Support him by the way  Everyone else was  Killing him  We just couldn't get  To all the phone calls  Huh  Thanks guy  Alright buddy  Paul in Toronto  Okay  Okay then  Be good Paul  It's all a boot  Yep  Let's talk about  Selling cars Paul  I sell  Bring in a tank  I'll sell the  Fucking thing  Hey a guy  Didn't want to buy  You know

You should  You're not talking about the Liberace movie  Oh well I did see that  So did I  That's all you should be talking about 
[01:35:30]  We all got screeners  I did not see the movie  I watched it  Oh yeah  Our pal Tom Papa's in the movie  He's very good  He's very good  Yeah yeah  He didn't get fucked in the ass  Whoa  Well talk about the movie Kenny  No he did not  What do you like about the movie  Yeah tell us a little about it  Yeah the ass fucking  There's a lot of ass fucking  There was some ass fucking going on  There was some cock sucking  Oh it was fucking pounding  All hot and sweaty and glistening  They're using poppers 
[01:36:00]  Yeah  Oh yeah  Tom  No  They were using poppers  I saw that  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah  Yeah  A lot of kissing going on  Oh yeah  Deep tongue kissing  Open mouth  And then the first night  Matt Damon stayed over  He didn't want to do anything  Because he wanted to give it  Like one night  Yeah he was a little apprehensive  That didn't last too long  No  Because when he woke up  He saw Michael Douglas  Just smiling at him 
[01:36:30]  Oh he was hovering over him  Yeah  Creepy smile  Then Michael Douglas  Sees like Matt Damon's tent  And he goes  Ooh  Look who's awake  Let me suck it to sleep  That's not what he said  And he sucked his dick  With a morning breath  Yeah yeah  That's all I could think of  Is he sucking his dick  With a morning breath  With Liberace morning breath  Lee  Lee  Yes  Lee  How cute was Lee  Without his toupee  That was fucking funny man  At the end he looked like E.T.  Laying in the fucking bathroom 
[01:37:00]  All gray  That was a toupee huh  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Yeah  Lebracci had the big toupee  Oh you're seeing me  Without my hair  He has to win something  For that Michael Douglas  He was fucking amazing  He was great  He was great  He won fucking anal warts  Rob Lowe was fucking great  Oh that was Rob Lowe  It was so funny  There's the face he's making  Oh my god  I didn't recognize  He plays the plastic surgery  Yeah  The plastic surgeon  Doctor  He was great watching him drink  Yeah  He couldn't open his mouth  He couldn't really open his mouth 
[01:37:30]  Or his eyes  He's just like  Oh I didn't get that  You're right  And he kept just turning his head  But he was fucking great  Is that what that was  Oh  Hilarious  I didn't catch that  And then Lebracci  He couldn't shut his eyes  After the facelift  Yeah  And Matt Damon was just  Watching him sleep  With his eyes open  Sweetie you're snoring  Sweetie  He's calling him sweetie  Sweetie  Hot tub together  Oh a lot of hot tubbing  And Matt Damon  Who plays Scott Thorson  He fucked him in the ass  But he didn't like  Getting fucked in the ass 
[01:38:00]  And Lebracci was annoyed at that  Yes  But it turns out  That's probably what  Saved this guy's life  Because Lebracci was  Taking dick  Well right now  Scott is  A victim of  Anal cancer  Yeah he is cancer  Advanced anal cancer  Oh god  He's not in good shape  He's in jail I think right  Is he?  Yeah  How old is he?  He's gotta be 50 something now  He was born in  He was 17  He was born in 1960  I think he's 57  Or something like that right  Maybe  No  I'm gonna guess 63 
[01:38:30]  No not that old  He's 54  Oh 54  He was just a young nubile  A young Adonis  But more importantly  I think Kenny really enjoyed the movie  You liked it huh?  How can't you?  Well  Holy mackerel  A lot of  A lot of sex scenes  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  There was one where  Lee was just being pounded in the ass  Yeah  And then he goes to grab a popper  And he's just  Oh  Oh  Banging against the headboard 
[01:39:00]  Yeah  Oh yeah  They just tell him that  Damon  Here take some  And he won't take any  So he just keeps fucking his ass  Uh huh  Yeah  He gave it to him like he did  And then he asked Lee  He's like how do you stay hard so long  And so many times  He's like  Well I had some implants  Did he really though?  Yeah  I had a procedure  I had a procedure  Oh my god  Was all this  This is all real shit  According to this guy?  Yeah  I guess so  No  I had a procedure

[01:55:00]  No but if your fingers  Are on the piano  I can see like  In your mind  You're going  Five over two  Over one back  Five over two  Over one back  But then they lift  Their hands  They go like  Yadadadadah  Flunk  And then they go  Right back  And they know  Exactly where they're  Supposed to be  It's second nature  It's like finger hopscotch  At that point  You just know it so well  Right  That you just  Second nature  How do you not  Hit the wrong key  Flunk  Well in the beginning  You do  Yeah  Until you figure that out  Mistakes  Now what's the difference  Between the white key  Like the white keys  Are like  And one of the black keys 
[01:55:30]  The black keys  Are minor keys  I wonder what's that mean though  They're underage  But no what does it mean  They have it  It's a minor note  They're minor notes  And the white keys  Are major notes  And you play them together  And they make a pretty  Fucking sound  Pretty harmonic  Then you're doing  The foot pedals  Foot pedals are volume  And  And a sustain  My fingers don't move  That fast doing nothing  Like I can't wave  As quickly as he can play  I'm waving in the air  Slow

[02:00:30]  Yeah  If you find a better copy  Yeah  Alright so Hangover 3  It was okay  Yeah it was alright  I mean if you want  It's just like the other ones  Yeah  Nothing surprisingly happens  Yeah  It's the last of the Wolfpack movie  But  That is it  Gotta say goodbye to the Wolfpack now  They're done  Yeah  Moving on to other projects  Is that it?  Was that it for your movies?  Or will they reboot  With a prequel?  No because Bradley Cooper's playing  I called the sniper guy  In the movie  Chris Kyle  Chris Kyle  Okay  Steven Spielberg's directing that one 
[02:01:00]  Wow that's very cool  It should be a huge one  Okay  I really want to know  How bad Hangover 3 was  I mean how good  How good could it be?  Yeah  Yeah  I feel like  It's like the same fucking  Is it the same fucking movie again?  Yeah but  Very similar  Extra stop  Extra stop  Jeffy Tambor dies  In the movie  Oh yeah  Yeah he's in there for like a minute  Jeffrey Tambor's in it?  Mmhmm 
[02:01:30]  Oh cool  He's in for a second  He was great on Friday man  Hilarious  Holy fuck  So quick  The new Arrested Development's good  You checked it out already?  Yeah I watched like the first four episodes  Wow  I think four or five  Yeah it's really funny  Got the whole cast back  Like every character  Yeah it's pretty amazing  They were able to figure that out  Yeah  Was Michael Serra in it?  Yeah  Was he  What was he  What kind of guy was he playing?  Well it's funny  Because he's in college now  Okay  And the thing is 
[02:02:00]  That's like a coming of age time  For everybody  Yes  Sure  I bet you he was  Because coming of  I bet you because he's going to college  Yeah  He had to be a little awkward  I bet you  A little uncomfortable in his skin  Yeah  And his new surroundings probably  That was the problem  He was just  Yeah  A little uncomfortable in his own skin  And he was  He's kind of awkward  As he went out there  He played awkward  Really?  He played a little awkward  Yeah in love with his cousin still  So  Really?  A little quirky?  Yeah he had some quirks to him  Like he was just a little left of center  You know?  Hmm  So it was something a little different 
[02:02:30]  A little stretch for him  It was still good  Yeah  A little stretch for him  Yeah  Now the cast  You're saying it's amazing  They were able to pull them all together  What were they doing?  Well Jason Bateman's  He's been making a movie or two  He's been making movies  A bunch of rom-coms  That didn't really do much  Yeah  Portia de Rossi's been  Sitting there with that Ellen money  Uh huh  You know  So she doesn't have to do anything  She just has to lick box  Every once in a while  But the other thing is  It's like seven years later  Normally when you get the cast back together 
[02:03:00]  You're like  Eh  I don't know  Yeah  But it still works  That's more of the  Seven years  It really was a great show  So I'm sure it'll do very well  On Netflix  Yeah and they're using the time  To like really play around with  Like every episode  They're like  Yeah this happened four years ago  And then six months later  And then three months later  And then two  And so it's like  You know  All that stuff could have happened  Lots of hijinks  Gotcha  Yeah  I didn't watch it when it was on initially  You should  So  You'll find it 
[02:03:30]  I guess I can't watch it now  I think you would like it  You will  You'll find it one day  And start talking about it  Like it's a new show  Alright  We might do that  Every once in a while here  You know  Every once in a while  A little behind  We weren't  We weren't behind  When it came to Gangnam Style  Yes you were  Nope  Yes  Right on that  You were actually right on it  That's a terrible example  No  We were right there man  Completely behind  Nope  We were ahead of it  See  Oh god  Remember this  Yeah  Remember this 
[02:04:00]  Oh wow  Yeah you remember  Morning mashup style  What was his follow up  Which was actually way better than I thought it would be  It's not  It's getting no heat  You guys  You guys were on top of the gentleman craze  Which just took off  Let's hear the gentleman  Can we hear that next one  Again  Yeah I want to hear the other one  Because it was better than I thought it was  Apparently that was alright  It's the same song  It's no Gangnam Style  I don't know Sam  I don't like to yell about it  I like to know the words of a song  How many hits does this bomb have  Well it's still got you know 
[02:04:30]  300 whatever million views  It's got over a quarter billion hits  This is popular  There's too many words in the song I don't know though  I hate that  We like potty hey  Doing a wacky dance  Yeah it's not a craze 
[02:05:00]  No  Like the other one was  Let's hear the hell  Damn girl  Okay here it comes  Here comes the Gangnam Style part  That's the Gangnam Style part  It's the same song  It is the same song 
[02:05:30]  It does  It's got the build up  It goes quiet  He's sort of doing the same dance  More  Of course  The beat is good though  A little more casual  When is he going to admit  He doesn't like girls though  That's what I want to know  Is he the Liberace  Is he the Riberace  He's an educator  Is he popular in Korea  Is he popular in Korea  Yeah  Feeling good 
[02:06:00]  Are there any copycats  Over there in Korea  Maybe over there  Because you know what happens  Some guy gets popular  And then there's a bunch of people  They'll jump on board  Right  So I'm thinking in Korea  Now there's got to be  A few people that are trying to be  A sigh  I would imagine  Yeah  He's been doing well over there  For a while though  Yeah  Is he like  Is he like everything in Korea 
[02:06:30]  Like he's the Beatles  He's fucking  I think at this point  He must be  No my manager actually lives  In the same building  As some big Korean star  Like a big actor in Korea  And he said  Every day there's girls outside  Screaming for this guy  Really  Because when he bought the apartment  It was on the front page  Of the Korean newspapers  Where this guy bought his apartment  So now everybody knows where he lives  Damn  That's probably not smart  Yeah  There's probably a lot of girls  Outside yelling  Like yay  Yeah  Fuck us  Fuck us  Psy

[02:19:00]  But first  One night in Bangkok  One night in Bangkok  And the tough guys tumble  Can't be too careful with your company  I can feel the devil walking next to me  Bangkok  And the city  They don't know what the city is getting 
[02:19:30]  The creme de la creme  Of the chess world  In a show with everything  But you'll bring her  Time flies  Doesn't seem a minute  Since the Duraly and Spar  Had the chess boys in it  All change  Don't you know that when you  Play at this level  There's no ordinary venue  It's Iceland  Or the Philippines  Or Hastings  Or  For this place  One night and back up in the world  You're a oyster  The bars are temples 
[02:20:00]  But their pulse ain't free  You'll find a god in every golden whisper  And if you're lucky  Then the god's a sheep  I can feel an angel sliding up to me  One town's very like another  When your head's down over your pieces, brother  It's a drag  It's a boar  It's really such a pity  To be looking at the boar  Not looking at the city  What do you mean?  You see one crowded polluted  Think a town  Tea town's warm and sweet 
[02:20:30]  Summer set up  In the summer set  More sweet  Get tired  You're talking to a tourist  Who's every move's among the purest  I get my kids above the waistline  Sunshine  One night and back  That makes the hard man humble  Not much between despair and ecstasy  One night and back  And the tough guys tumble  Can't be too careful with your comfort needs 
[02:21:00]  I can feel the devil walking next to me  As I am's gonna be the witness to the ultimate test of cerebral fitness  This grips me more than would a muddy old river or reclining Buddha 
[02:21:30]  Thank God I'm only watching the game  Controlling it  I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate I'm contemplating  I'd let you watch  I would invite you  But the queens we use would not excite you  So you better go back to your bars  Your temples  Your massage parlors  One night and back  One night and back  Up through the world's your face  The balls are temples but the pulse ain't free 
[02:22:00]  You'll find a god in every golden cluster  A little flesh and little history  I can feel an angel sliding up to me  One night in Bangkok makes the heart land humble  Not much between despair and ecstasy  One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble  Can't be too careful with your company 
[02:22:30]  I can feel the devil walking next to me  The Opie and Anthony Show  Serious XM  Serious XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  Why are we playing this? 
[02:23:00]  We're playing weird 80s music  It was just one, it was a goof  One night in Bangkok was just a goof  Mr. Roboto  Oh yeah, alright, Mr. Roboto  My book smells good  Ben Mesrick  Cool, it's up  Coming in with another book  Straight flush  Story of has six college friends who dealt their way to a billion dollar online poker empire 
[02:23:30]  And how it all came crashing down  Good for him  Snooki was down on the Jersey Shore there  I like Ben, I hope he knows that  I like him a lot actually  He is very, very good on our radio show  Well, Governor Christie's down there trying to check out the damage from the hurricane and where they're at at this point  Oh there it is right there  He needs to have a little more love with Obama  Which by the way is, I don't know what he's trying to do here 
[02:24:00]  Politically  Is Obama taking a look today?  Yeah, yeah  At the progress?  Yeah  That has been made since all the promises went out?  Yeah, he'll make a big speech  But Christie is definitely trying to, you know, get his support going, I think, for his presidential run  Which I'm positive he'll make  And he's kind of being wishy-washy, middle of the road there  I don't know  I don't think it's going to help him being a pal with Obama 
[02:24:30]  Let's put it that way  He wants to squeeze some of those Obama people  Yeah  Squeeze them over to the other side when it's time to vote  Well, I don't know how that's going to work for him  He's going for a little squeeze there  You know  How's his weight look?  He still looks like a fat motherfucker  And his pants are still too high  Way too high  The fuck?  No one wears their pants that high anymore  No  Nobody  Nobody  Anyway, Snooki was down there  I don't know  Why was Snooki so close to Governor Christie? 
[02:25:00]  I don't know this story, really  The Jersey Shore girls, Snooki, JWoww, and Dina  And Dina  Were doing a Today Show segment  As was  What's-his-face, Governor Christie  Two separate  Two separate  Segments  Today Show segments  So they bumped into each other, kind of  With the cameras rolling  Yeah, and Governor Christie  Was outspoken about  Not liking the Jersey Shore  Yeah, of course  The image they portray about Jersey  Yeah, of course  Of course  That's exactly what he should have done  It was promoted without being punched in the face 
[02:25:30]  What, is he supposed to like that?  He's a governor  Punched in the face  It's the drunk whore thing  Snooki basically has shown her cunt a few times  Right, right  Sorry that the governor is not supporting you and your show  Yeah  Yeah  So Snooki had to be a little cunty  To the governor  Approached him  We all know she could be a little cunty  Yeah, she was in here that one day  And I just got a cunt vibe from her  Did you?  Not as bad as Paris Hilton  But  No  There was a cunt vibe  Oh, yeah  I'm with Anthony on this one  No, I'm not saying I was bad as Paris Hilton 
[02:26:00]  No, no  No, I'll tell you why  Because she had gotten bashed by this show  So she probably was very defensive  And surprised that we were as nice as we were  I had fun with her twice  Yeah, I think she was  Oh, good for you  No, you didn't  She lied to us about her pregnancy  I bet she was saying shit  She was being all like  Meh, meh, meh  But it was fun, right?  I don't know  She told me how many stitches she got in her vagina  After pregnancy  3,210,000  They're still stitching her up  She's still a cunt  I don't care  Yeah, she's cunty, Sam  Fuck her  Good for you that you got along with that  Yeah, that's great 
[02:26:30]  Sam Roberts  She also lied to us  We could have had all the headlines  Because she was just gotten pregnant  She wasn't three months pregnant yet  She announced it soon after our show  Too much the next day  Right  So what are you talking about?  It wasn't that soon  Yeah, it was  It was an hour later  Never go against the family again  You're right  It was an hour later, Sam  Making things up  In ONA time, it was an hour later  It was right after our show  Exactly  You're right  It was actually on out cue  In this building  So we got a clip  It's hard to hear  But here's Snooki being cunty 
[02:27:00]  To Governor Christie  Someone ask you my opinion?  I'm from Jersey  I know you are  And guess what?  I thought you did a good job with the hurricane  Thank you very much  I appreciate it  That's Dina  That was Dina?  I think, yeah!  That was Snooki at first  The very beginning  When she goes  Why are you talking so close to me?  That's Snooki  Right  And then Dina is the one that says  I think you did a good job  What do you mean  Why are you talking so close to me?  Because Governor Christie  Kind of bent down 
[02:27:30]  Oh, see  That was her being cunty  Yeah, that's her being cunty  Why are you getting so close to me?  Well, because you're only  Two feet from the ground  So you've got to bend over  Like, I'm not going to take  You know, I don't care who you are  I'm not going to let you  Right  You're the only guy  I won't show my pussy to  Yeah  You know what she is?  She's a little shorty  She is a little shorty  Hey, what are you doing over there?  Short stuff  Oh my god, I hate it  You know what?  No, I kind of like it, actually 
[02:28:00]  I kind of like it  You know why he was bending down  To talk to stupid Snooki?  Why?  Because she's a little shorty  Whoa  She's like, thanks  He just turns and walks away  He just doesn't like us  Alright, I'm ready 
[02:28:30]  Why should he like you?  Yeah  You get completely hammered  And fall down on dance floors  And everyone sees your cunt  Yes  And it's not even just that  There's no way he could like her  She's just  She's such a little shorty  He's supposed to like her?  Yeah  No  She's amazed  She's amazed that Governor Christie doesn't like her  Yeah  And walk right up to her and go  Hey, how you doing shorty? 
[02:29:00]  Governor Christie talks some shit about me though  I'd be like  You don't like me  Yeah, I'd be all about it  I'd be like, that's kind of cool  That he even knows who the fuck I am  Oh, come on  But Snooki just amazed  Has she seen her own show?  I don't know  They get wasted  They fight  They fuck  And they show their private parts  She comes off as a drunk, obnoxious whore bag  So fuck her  What the hell?  Do you understand what your show was about?  Yeah  You weren't really getting much done there 
[02:29:30]  She's a mother now  Oh, yeah  Anyway  What's going on with this cruise ship?  Who the fuck was going on a cruise ship at this point?  Oh, there was a little fire  Fire  Fire  Fire  There wasn't a big fire though  It was just  They said it was short-lived  No  We thought boat could have been sinking  Wow  The grandeur of the seas  Caught fire  That's an impressive fire actually  The ass end there  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  Pretty big  Right  But apparently they were able to  You know  Their emergency system they have in place was pretty good 
[02:30:00]  And no one got hurt or anything  And they weren't adrift at sea for a long time  Like the Carnival cruise ship  Right  So, yeah  I think I've been on that ship  That actual ship?  Yeah  Okay  The grandeur of the seas  I've been on a lot of those Royal Caribbean ones  E-Rock, have you been on that one?  No, I haven't been on that one  You went on the grandeur?  For a cruise guy  You haven't been on a cruise in a while, you know  I know  You know what he's been doing?  Uh-oh  Writing a movie?  Can I tell him?

He goes  No, he didn't  Yes, I did  Yes, I did  You made a whole story about  No, no, no, no  Right after the show  It's 11 a.m. on the dot  He goes back to the office  And he gets in front of his computer  And it had probably been a tough day for him  He probably got made fun of a bit  Oh  And he gets in front of his computer  And he watches YouTube videos  Of cruise ships  Oh my god 
[02:31:00]  And like Roland  Roland will try to make fun of him  I don't believe you  I swear to god  Roland will try to make fun of him  And go  Hey Eric  Blah, blah, blah  And Eric ignores everybody in the room  And just stares right at that cruise ship  What scenes are you looking at?  It's the Smithsonian Channel  Does specials on the building of the ship  I have seen that  Yeah  I have watched that on TV at home  That's not that bad  They'll show you how they build it to the launch  To go across the Atlantic  But he wasn't watching  He was watching the launch

Oh my god  Jesus  Did you roll into that one?  Wow  I would watch that though  If it's a show about construction  It was very interesting  Tell you the truth  It was not construction  That he was watching  No  I watched him turn on the YouTube video  To the part where the ship is sailing  What's that?  Yeah  Sea Trials  Come on

I don't know  It's like heat sealing the bag and cutting it  Why'd you have to do frozen pancakes?  Couldn't you have done this with potato chips?  Yes  They've done that before  It's amazing  Oh aunt your mom  Eggos  I was like yeah but that's  That's a dumb how is it  And that's when they put the picture of the old 
[02:36:00]  On the box  Do I have a beep?  Yeah you know a beep?  I don't think so  I used to have a beep  I'd like a beep  It's cause we can curse  But there are certain things you know  How did they make the violin bow?  I need to know  What is that shit made of?  It's horse hair  That's what I thought  It's horse hair  It really is horse hair though  From the horse's tail  And they fucking brush it  It's all nice  Did they get it off live horses?  I guess so  Did they explain that?  They didn't explain that but  And does the horse hair grow back?  Well yeah 
[02:36:30]  If you cut a horse's tail hair  It grows back  It grows back so  Yeah  Where are they harvesting the hair from?  Horses  But which  Horses ass  No I know but which horses?  They get pulled right by the face  I bet you they have special breeds of horses  That are better for bows  Yeah  You would think  It seemed so like detailed  And the work seemed so tingles  How many hairs make one?  It's got any more than one  How do they get the dingleberries off the horse hair  Before they make it to the violin bow?  It smells like horse asshole right by your face 
[02:37:00]  Is that how a violin sounds?  Yeah  I didn't know  I didn't realize  That's why you hold it away from your face  You smell the horse ass still?  Yeah  He says you smell all that old son  I think they washed it  Yeah  I want to know how many hairs make one fucking bow though 
[02:37:30]  It can't be one  You don't remember how they make it  It's a bunch  It's a whole shit bow  It's wound together right?  No  It's laid out straight  Flat  Not wound together at all  They melt some rosy  And together on each end  So they stay together  But then they shove them in some fucking hole  That's got chiseled out  And put a little plug in that heat chiseled out  Everything's totally made by hand  Oh my god  Crazy  What is that Sam?

Straight Flush  It's about a group of frat brothers from University of Montana  Who were like poor kids  One of them was so poor he sold a cow to buy his first car  And they used to play poker in a bar  A local bar in the basement  And they decided to put it online  And it became one of the largest online poker companies in the world  They moved their frat to Costa Rica  You know lots of girls, hookers and drugs and stuff 
[03:05:30]  And they were making a million dollars a day  It became this huge business  Can you say the name of it?  It was called absolutepoker.com  Oh this is a real  Absolute poker and ultimate bet  They bought ultimate bet  I've heard of those  And then the US government decided to try and make poker illegal  Yes  And now they're all fugitives  One's in Antigua in hiding  One's in Panama  That's disgusting  They're all on the run  And now online poker's becoming legal again  Yeah  But these guys still face 80 year indictments  Well you know  If  Wow  Yeah  If something becomes illegal 
[03:06:00]  Legal  Right  But if you did it and it was illegal  And you're a fugitive  Then you're still a fugitive  And again if it's legal when you start doing it  They can kind of grandfather you in  That's right  But they were offshore  They were offshore  So why are they in trouble?  80% of their players were American  Oh I see  That's how they got them  So in 2006  Two moralizing senators tried to make online gambling illegal  Bill Frist  Remember he was running for president  Yeah I met him  Sure  Four minutes and 30 seconds ago  And so these guys 
[03:06:30]  One of them turned himself in  And is now doing 12 months  14 months in a federal prison  That's easy though  But what's crazy is  That's easy considering the money he made  Is he keeping the money?  He had to pay a million dollar fine  That's easy  If you're making a million a day  You take the hit  You give the government a million  You do 14 months in jail  Standing on your head right?  Standing on your head  If you know you're coming out  And you got millions  He might  We don't know what anybody has left  Because it was unregulated  There were no  That's true  Let me tell you what  Some of the things that I realized happened  I was playing online poker  On one of the sites and stuff 
[03:07:00]  And I was using  I guess one of my credit cards  No  I think it was from  Yeah the credit card  Right  And I got an email from them  Months later  That said  Well your credit card company  And I had already played with the money  Lost it  Whatever  Your credit card company  Is denying payment on this  So if you could just send us the money  And I'm just like  Yeah you're right  Yeah  All right  And all I'm thinking is  That must have happened to a lot of people  Oh yeah  When the law came down on everything 
[03:07:30]  The credit card companies were like  Well hundreds of millions of people  Players lost everything  I mean one day  The ones that were ahead  The Department of Justice raided  And everybody's money just disappeared  Yeah  Fucking disgusting  Wow  Three minutes and 20 seconds ago  Oh jeez  So if  Wait wait  Back to you though  How much was it  That you were off the hook for  Probably  About  I know you don't talk numbers  About 1200  That's not that much  Really  Considering  How much I was playing  On some of those rooms  You know I was doing  500 dollar games  That's a lot of money  You know 
[03:08:00]  You make it sound like nothing  Because you're rich  But you know  For 100 is a lot of money  For most of those  So now what's happening  With these guys  So one of them  I said turned himself in  Went to jail  One is in Antigua  He can't set foot off  The island of Antigua  Or he'll be picked up  Like even swimming  That's he doesn't  He believes that if he goes  Offshore  A certain amount  A fucking submarine  Is going to come  FBI agents  In a boat waiting for him  You make that sound like  That's horrible  It's Antigua  Well it's not  How cool is that  That's funny  Because when I interview him  He's always like in an infinity pool  And he's got like  Dune buggies and stuff 
[03:08:30]  But the thing is  It sucks in that  He's been there  He'll be there  For the rest of his life  I mean that  When you look at that  The bird in the gilded cage  It's the gilded cage  Is Antigua really nice  Or I mean  Yeah it's nice  It's beautiful  But it's small  I mean it's the size of  You know  Tiny little village  You gotta get the fuck out of there  At some point  And he can't get another job  I mean he can't work  Well what would he get  If he left Antigua  Well his family  No I mean  Would he get the same deal  Like a year or so in jail  And a million dollar fine  Because he didn't hand himself over  I have a feeling  They'd make an example out of him  That's what he's afraid of 
[03:09:00]  And he's afraid  They'd put him in  Like a real prison  Oh shit  Bernie gets  I mean I'm sorry  Where they fuck heinies  Bernie Madoff  Is not even in that type of jail  Right  Bernie Madoff stole a billion dollars  And that hunk of shit  Is in a minimum security jail  I mean talk about absurd  We were all lining up  For Powerball tickets  A few weeks ago right  And these guys are in jail  For a poker  Yeah I know  What's the difference  What's the sense of that  Absolutely  And it's just because  They're not getting their cut  Because they're not getting their taste  Government needs their taste  Well the state of New York 
[03:09:30]  Went after PokerStars  Which was in the same indictment  And the PokerStars guy  Paid a 750 million dollar fine  To the DOJ  In the state of New York  And now he's off  You know it's like  It's a money thing  That makes it right  That makes it okay  All of a sudden  The right and wrong aspect of it  Is only money  It's big money  It really is  So why can't this guy  Fly somewhere else  Why does he have to  No extradition  Because anywhere he goes  If there's an extradition  He'll probably get grabbed  He's just afraid  Of getting picked up  But can't he go somewhere  Where  You always worry  If there's an emergency 
[03:10:00]  And the plane has to land somewhere  Right  And it's not  You know  A lot of people that  Are thinking about  Going to a place  That doesn't have extradition  You gotta consider the fact  That maybe there might be  A mechanical problem  Right  We're diverting the plane  To fuck you  Right  And the other thing is  It all depends on  How badly they want him  I mean if they feel like  They could get half a billion dollars  Off of him  They might work hard to get him  Can't they just drag him in  And make up a story  We found him on a raft  A couple hundred yards offshore  Antigua protects him  Oh they do  Antigua believes that  Online poker should be legal 
[03:10:30]  They're right  And I believe he's probably  Put some money into Antigua  And Antigua  So on that island  He feels safe  But he wouldn't feel safe  In Costa Rica  Right  In Costa Rica  They raided his house  And were dragging everything  Out of his house  And a couple of the other guys  I would meet in Toronto  Because they were willing  To go to Canada  Because Canada has  Pretty liberal laws  How about France  Obviously Roman Polanski  Is doing pretty well there  Well it's okay if you do that  It's not okay if you play poker  Don't play poker  But you know  A little statutory rape  Right  That's a different rule  Right  But it's crazy 
[03:11:00]  It's nuts  It's all very strange laws  And horse racing  You can bet  The horse is online  You can bet horse racing  You can bet  All sorts of things  You can play  Casinos  There's a casino  Ten minutes from every city  In the country  Right  But lottery  Everything  But you know  I'm not trying to make  These guys out to be saints  I mean there was  A lot of cocaine  And hookers  Pretty much continuously  Through the book  But in terms of  What they did with  Online poker  They shouldn't be  Facing prison  Yeah no way  Sounds like another  Great book by you man  Thank you 
[03:11:30]  How many movies  You got  Well I mean  The two were made  And then we're  Working on this one  My last book  Sex on the Moon  Is at Sony  And I just sold  Something to  20th Century Fox  With Brett Ratner  The director  Who's awesome  So I've got a few things going on  You know what I heard  About Sony today  It just blew my fucking mind  They're actually thinking  About getting rid of  The electronics  The entertainment  They were considering  Like spinning off  And completely getting rid  Of their electronic sector  TVs  The games  Everything  Electronic  Because when they 
[03:12:00]  Look at the books  It doesn't do anything  For their bottom line  The electronics  Do you know what  They make most  Of their fucking money  Like all their fucking money  Sony  Selling insurance  In Japan  Sony  Sony sells insurance  In Japan  That's where their  Whole fucking shit  Comes from  All that electronics  Fucking playstation  Fucking tvs  With Sony on it  All your headphones  You this that  Nothing  Good you know why  Because they're so obsessed  With their  What is  Nothing they have  Works with anything else 
[03:12:30]  Oh yeah  Proprietary  Proprietary shit  Sony is terrible with  Yeah  Fucking insurance salesman  That kind of makes sense though  Pricks  Good for them  This annoyed me  I actually want to read this  Because that story annoys me  That the government  Got involved with that shit  Shut it all down  And yeah  Creeps  Whose business is it  Who cares  I mean why  And now it's becoming  It's legal in Nevada  And New Jersey now  And why  Why have they decided  To make it legal  Because they finally  Figure out how to make money  As long as they're going to get  Tax money out of it 
[03:13:00]  The states are always  Looking for money  So the first legal  Online poker company  Just opened in Nevada  But you have to be  In Nevada  They triangulate your cell phone  So you have to have  A computer open to play  And a cell phone next to it  And then you can play  And they just ping your cell phone  To make sure you're in Nevada  Jesus Christ  Someone will figure out  A workaround  Of course you would think  I mean someone would be anywhere  But slowly it'll go state by state  And then it'll eventually be back  Holy shit  Instantly I'm like  How can we get past that cell phone  I'll tell you how  You give somebody a phone 
[03:13:30]  When they're in Nevada  And tell them just to turn  How do they know  If it's right by your computer  They know where your phone is  So the location of your phone  How do they know  Where your computer is  Oh probably  The IP address  The IP address  Yeah the IP address  I'm sure there's a way around it  But I mean if you're  Really trying that hard  I mean  Yeah  Just get a ticket  And go to the casino  Yeah really  Just go to Nevada  It's good that they can track you  To play online poker  But we can't figure out  A way to track missing children  Priorities really sink  Sounded very adult  Yeah  You know 
[03:14:00]  We can put a man on the moon  Yeah but it's just the priorities  Are just for them to get  Their greedy dick beaters  On more of your money  Yes  True  These fucking pigs  Constant  It's a constant search  For your shit  They can't keep their fucking hands  Off your money  I hate that  Oh man  Well you know what  What a great book  What a great interview  This has been  Six minutes  The six minutes  We actually gave you  A couple extra  We actually went a little over  We go way back with you  So we gave you  An extra three  Thank you guys  And if you wanna  You know  Hang out 
[03:14:30]  I'm sure Sam Roberts  Would love to have you  Of course  No he's good  Really  Yeah he's really good  Sam does the  After 08 show  He does a good interview  I don't look funny  I'm handsome  You look stupid  He looks stupid  He looks stupid  You look like fucking  You look like Bozo the clown  In the dressing room  Before fucking showtime  All of you are stupid  Creepy denim shirt  Good one  That is very nicely  Good one  Good comeback  Exactly  Is that for animals?  No you're stupid  You're all stupid  No you're stupid 
[03:15:00]  And Bozo never wore denim  So that makes you even double stupid  I don't like your fucking  Two different denim pants and shirt  I don't like your Black Sabbath t-shirt  Doesn't like you either  Black Sabbath is a t-shirt  Doesn't like or dislike anyone  Told you  Stupid  Been doing a lot of TV I see  I'm doing Today's show tomorrow  That's awesome  That's weird  I saw you on TV this morning  Today's show tomorrow  Who are you doing?  I'm just  Squawk box  I guess  Squawk box  Were you talking some stocks?  I call every girl I've dated  Squawk box  You gotta remember that one 
[03:15:30]  For next time on the show  Your book has a very long title  Just say that  Ben Mesrick  Straight flush obviously  The true story of six college friends  Who dealt their way to a billion dollar online poker empire  And how it all came crashing down  Out today in all the places you get books these days  Cool man  A little of that collusion going online too  It was pretty easy to go in with two or three people  Oh there were some cheating scandals  There's cheating in the book too 
[03:16:00]  Yeah  The companies themselves there was some cheating  Oh I'm sure  Yeah yeah  But it was kind of cool  You'd get like three guys at a table  And you're either playing from the same room  Right  Or you got like you're texting each other  Or have FaceTime opened up  And you're like what do you got?  So now you all know what each other has  Yeah  You know who should be the guy that goes for it  And the other guys just pump up  And try to get the other guys out  It winds up  You have a much better chance of  Oh yeah  Of course  The whole pot  Yeah  Yeah working together  But they frowned upon that I guess 
[03:16:30]  How do you know that the game isn't cheating you?  It's a fucking computer  Well there were a couple times  When that did happen  Hey he's got two kings  Should we give him a third?  No we shouldn't  No we shouldn't  Three of clubs  And tell him to eat ass  And fucking beat it  The thing is  The company was making the money off of the rake  So they didn't care what was  It's like a casino doesn't need to cheat  Because they're all going to make all your money anyway  As long as you're betting against somebody else 
[03:17:00]  And the pot gets in there  They take a little percentage of the pot  It doesn't matter who's winning or losing at the table  No  Unless they've got some of their players in there  Now winning hands on top of that  They want the guy to get that third king  And they want a guy to get the third ace  Right  And they want them to bet against each other  Get the pot really high  So they won't make a money  But yeah I would assume that if they're playing in the games  And they can control the fucking outcome  There was a couple incidents right  Yeah  But they paid back the players once the players found out 
[03:17:30]  Ain't that nice  Who found out?  How'd they figure it out?  Players figured it out  They got a hold of like  These guys are pretty serious  The players  They would get 10,000 hand histories  Wow  And look at every hand and say  This guy was always betting at the right time  How did he know to bet?  And then they analyzed it with mathematical models  And figured out someone was cheating  Oh wow  Who's it?  I would just go  I lost a bunch of money  Yeah  Yes I did  I'm going to nap  I'm going to nap  Wow  All right kids  It's been fun  Hey really fun  Love having you guys  Sorry about the traffic

[03:21:30]  I get every  Ever since bringing down the house  And the movie 21  Yeah  I get pitches  And it's usually college kids  Who've done something crazy or wild  And they'll just email me  Or tweet me or whatever  And I go through them all  And try and find a story  That has all the elements  Like the sex and the fun locales  That I want to go to  And all that craziness  And this story just caught my eye  Because it's online poker  And it just seemed really cool  A bunch of frat brothers  Who kind of went in that direction  Yeah  And almost became billionaires  But yeah  I just get pitched  Everything  Continuous pitching  And that's what changed everything 
[03:22:00]  Bringing down the house  I think that was the first one  The social network kind of  Brought a whole new audience to me  Right  21 bringing down the house  Because it was like a caper  You know it was young kids  Pulling off a scheme  Yeah  And so that's been what everybody  Yeah it was like  Ocean's 11  Except with kids  College kids  Yeah yeah yeah  So yeah that really launched it  And it really happened  Like Ocean's 11 is a fantasy world  Right right  And you're looking at this thing  Like oh my god  Is that what you like  Do you only like writing non-fiction  Or  You know it's  I really enjoy it  If there's like a story like that  Or it's kind of something you never really heard about 
[03:22:30]  And it's kind of a secret  That really I like  Yeah I love the big true stories  That can be written as a thriller  Yeah  I used to write fiction  And I will write fiction in the future  But  These non-fiction stories  As long as the stories keep coming  I like doing them  And do you think it's easier to grab people  When it's non-fiction  Just the idea of  You have to find the right non-fiction story  Right  But when you can find stories  Like you find  Well yeah personally  Yeah you want it to be true  I think when you read something  You know  When it's true  It just adds that extra factor  It makes you like it more  Especially when it's real crazy 
[03:23:00]  Right  Well yeah that's why  I think half the reason why people like Fargo  Right  Is because in the beginning  It says it's a true story  Right and then it's not  And then everybody just believes it  Yeah  Then you watch like the bonus features on the DVD  And William H. Macy says that  He was like  Is there any research on this?  Could I find like the real people?  And they were like  It's not true  It's not true  We just  We just say that  It's not true  It's not actually a true story  That's funny  Yeah  Do you  How close  I guess they're not really  Do you feel like they become your stories  When you write them? 
[03:23:30]  You know  I try  I do  When I write them  I kind of insert myself in  I try and become a part of it  Yeah  I'm bringing down the house  I was strapping money to my body  And going to and from Vegas  For this one  I was  That's ridiculous  In Antigua with the main character  I do try and get inside it  And I insert myself a little bit  I mean when I write the story  I try and tell it from their point of view  Uh-huh  I get attacked a lot  Because sometimes my characters  Become like heroes in the story  Even when they're doing  Pretty horrible things sometimes  And so because I really begin to identify with them I think  But yeah I get inside  I want to be inside it  And you have to kind of become an expert in whatever 
[03:24:00]  Yeah I mean I was card counting with the blackjack team  I was going to Vegas every weekend  I was you know carrying a quarter million dollars under my clothes  How do you get people to trust you?  Well that's  To kind of enter that world  That's part of the game  I don't go in as like a journalist with a notepad and a tape recorder  I go in as part of the story  You know  I go in as I'm going to go at two in the morning to some club with these guys  It's not you know  I'm not trying to out anybody and ruin anybody's lives  Right your idea is to kind of be able to tell the story from a first person perspective  Right exactly  So you know the hard thing is to trust  I mean sometimes it takes a while to get in 
[03:24:30]  Sometimes they hate you after the project's done  You know and afterwards they're like  I didn't want you to write that  It always  It's different with every project  So  But the Facebook book  Yeah  It was called Accidental Billionaires  Right  That turned into the social network  You didn't get to do anything with  That was totally  That was Eduardo  Mark was very unhappy with me  Yeah  So I was  Did you meet him?  I spoke to and from their people  Mark refused to talk to me in the end  I was close with Sean Parker  Who was the Justin Timberlake character  The Winklevii twins 
[03:25:00]  Yeah  You couldn't invent these guys if you wanted to  I love those guys  What's great is  Yeah because you watch them  And then now you see them on like  You know 2020 and all these 60 Minutes  And stuff like that  And you're like  Yeah  That's them  I can't believe they exist  They're six foot five identical twin Olympic rowers  And they dress in suits  They're great  They own it  And then I knew Eduardo well  Eduardo's the one who came to me  And wanted to tell  The Andrew Garfield character  Was just you know  Mark Zuckerberg screwed me  That's how he opened this  He emailed me  I started hanging out with him  And he wanted to tell that story  So Mark was very unhappy 
[03:25:30]  I was writing it  So Zuckerberg never  And how difficult is that for you?  Because you have to know  Right  That this Zuckerberg has an army of lawyers  Waiting for you to do one thing  That he can sue you for  And many billions of dollars  You know I knew that as long as  We were telling the truth  And as long as  I feel like the book and the movie  Are very accurate  He says they're bull  He says you know  But if they were actually bull  Well I mean they have reasons  Not to sue obviously  But you know in the end  This was what Eduardo felt happened  This is what the Winklevii felt happened  This is what Sean felt happened  Mark I'm very clear in the beginning of the book  That Mark would not talk to me 
[03:26:00]  So if you want Mark's story  You have to wait for Mark to tell it  But he would never tell the story  That Eduardo wanted to tell  And I felt pretty sure  That as long as I walked you know  In the truth I would be okay  Do you know how to tell  When people are lying at this point  Well I mean that's part of the game too  And sometimes you do catch them in lies  Yeah  Yes  Not necessarily right away  But I have a lot of court documents  So a book like The Social Network  You have 10,000 pages of court documents  With everybody's interviews in it  To go cross check everything with 
[03:26:30]  So when someone says something  And then I read a court document  And I know they're not telling the truth  Then I can call them on it  But yeah you can sort of tell  I mean you got to read people  And have you ever gotten like started on a book  And realized a lot of this is bullshit  I get pitch stories all the time  And I'm like this can't possibly be true  And then I get inside and like  Oh yeah it wasn't true  Like Tucker Max or something  Tucker Max has built his own industry right  Around bullshit  He doesn't need someone else to write it for him  Yeah I've had a few instances  Where I've gotten into a story  And then realized I can't write it 
[03:27:00]  For various reasons  But maybe it's too dangerous sometimes  Sometimes I get into a story  And I'm like you know what  If I go this route  I'll probably get killed  So I'm not going to write this story  Some people just don't want to be exposed  I don't want to  I remember I was getting pitched  During the whole Egyptian revolution  Back the guys in the square  Were trying to get me to go there  And tell their story  And I was like oh man  I'm going to get my head cut off  I'm not going to go there  I kind of like writing about  American college kids  Right right  I'll go to Vegas  What's the worst that could possibly happen  Send me to Vegas  So what is the most dangerous thing you've done  Is it  You know when I wrote  I wrote a book called Ugly Americans 
[03:27:30]  Which is about a guy  Who gets caught up in the Japanese mob  And he falls in love with  Somebody he meets in a sex club  It's all in the sex underground in Japan  And there was a chapter in that book  About this Chinese Hong Kong billionaire  And when I wrote it  The main character called me  And said oh you can't turn it in like this  And I was like why  And he goes that guy's notorious  For killing journalists  I was like all right  I'm done with this book  You know  No I wrote the book  But I didn't  I cut that chapter  There's been a few instances  When I was in Vegas  You're willing to sacrifice your integrity  If it means nobody will murder you  I wrote a story 
[03:28:00]  When I wrote Bringing Down the House  I was interviewing people in Vegas  And some private eyes were like  Oh we want to meet you  And so they picked me up  And then they drove me  Into like the middle of the desert  And like dropped me off  And it was just to  Kind of just to show me  That they could do stuff like that  But they did that  Yeah they did  And then someone came  And picked me up like an hour later  But it was like  What did you do for the hour?  I thought I was going to die  Did you stand there?  Did you walk around?  I didn't have any way  Of doing anything  No cell phone reception  Nothing  So you just kind of sat  I was waiting by the side of the road  And I had a feeling  They would come back  Because they wanted to do the interview 
[03:28:30]  But it was one of those moments  You hoped  It was one of those moments  Like well who am I dealing with here?  And I try and be careful  You know  And you don't want to  Go meet with mobsters  Unless you know them  Unless you're friends  You have to really get to know  Your mobsters  Right  Exactly  Kind of  Wow  So when you did the Ugly Americans  Did you have to spend a lot of time  In sex clubs?  I did  I mean I went  I say it like  I went to Tokyo for about a month  Or you know a few weeks  And it takes place in this world  He was an American kid  He basically packed a bag  And moved to Japan  And worked for a hedge fund  Made a single deal 
[03:29:00]  That made $500 million in five minutes  He became very wealthy  But it all takes place  In these places  Like called sexual harassment clubs  Which would be like a club  That looks like a subway car  And it even vibrates  Like a subway car  And there are women  Who are standing there  Pretending they're riding the subway  They're hired to be there  And you pay a fee  To go in and molest them  Or there's places called  Wow  No underwear coffee shops  No pants coffee shops  And it's a coffee shop  Where all the girls  Are in skirts with no underwears  And the floor is glass  And you go underneath  And it's just like  A coffee shop underneath  It's 
[03:29:30]  Japan is crazy  I mean it's  You know  When I wrote that book  I spent a lot of time  Investing  Because that's where  All of these scenes take  Business takes place  In these places called  Soap lands  Soap lands are the  Famous ones  Where every level  Is a different level  Of woman  And at the top  Are actual porn stars  And actresses  Oh I thought you meant  I thought you meant  Like at the bottom  They're just men  No no  And then women with penises  Maybe there's a basement  No but it's  And you go in  And you pay a fee  Depending on what floor  You want to go to  And it's just  Japan has a very  Lively sex industry 
[03:30:00]  So the book  Ugly Americans  I know  The book I'm talking about  Now is straight flush  But Ugly Americans  Was a book I wrote  That took place  In that world  Does that have  When you go  And you do these  Press tours  For new books  Yeah  Obviously you're going  To end up talking  About your experiences  Writing all the other books  Do all your books  Get kind of a boost  In sales  You know I do  Bringing down the house  Is the perennial  Kind of  Every college kid  Reads that 21  Or sees 21  Well because they all  Think they're going  To be card characters  They're all going to go to  Vegas and beat Blackjack  I feel bad  Because I always see  People reading that book  On the flight to Vegas  That's the worst time  To read that book 
[03:30:30]  But yeah  That one is always big  You should be reading  A book on how to  Car ride  Not how that guy  Car ride  Exactly  And then the Facebook  Book obviously does  You know it always  Gets a pick up  When I go out  And Ugly Americans  Was one of the ones  That kind of never  Took off  But  Why wouldn't they  Turn that into a movie  We've sold it three times  It's almost been made  A movie by everybody  Oliver Stone almost  Made it at one point  It was at DreamWorks  For a while  It came close and close  And close and close  And I would love  To see it made  But really cool story  But it just  Not quite  I mean just because  Of the environment  It takes place  Just to introduce 
[03:31:00]  To people  Well it was all about  That expat  American kids  Living large in Asia  And it's like  A crazy world  You'd go out there  And at 22  You'd be given  These $10,000  A month apartments  You'd have five girlfriends  Who all knew each other  But didn't care  You'd have like  You'd live like a rock star  And you would work  At a bank  And it was just this  The western banking community  In Hong Kong  And Tokyo  It was just crazy  So when you go  Into the subway club  Are you  Do you end up  Sort of being like  I don't know  Personally  Well I know  I'm the writer 
[03:31:30]  I just watch  I'm like  You just watch  I'm like  My whole career  Is the fly on the wall  And no part of you  Wants to be like  I don't know  You really think  We should be molesting  These girls  Do they like this  That's the thing  And that's part of  What the story is about  Is that you know  Americans are not  Brought up the way  Japanese are brought up  In Japan  Sex is something  It's like a bodily function  It's not considered bad  When men go on  Business trips  Their wives will pack  Condoms  Along with them  In case they feel a need  It's not considered  Wrong sex  Like toothpaste  Shampoo  Condoms  So American guys  College age guys 
[03:32:00]  Who go to Asia  It's like a bizarre world  I mean it's a different  They don't  And a lot of these places  They won't let westerns in  They actually have  No gaijin or no westerners  Allowed  And so you go to these sex  Unless you have a guide  Who is Japanese  You can't get into these places  And that's how you got into  Yeah they make a big X sign  And you're not allowed in  So you have to have people there  To take you around  Yeah  And it's incredibly expensive also  I mean everything is ridiculous  I would imagine  Do they actually have  Vending machines  That sell dirty underwear  They sell girls panties  They do 
[03:32:30]  Yeah  And the famous porn stars  Will sign panties  And wear them  And then put them  In these vending machines  I know  Let's take a phone call  Chip  My publisher probably  Just had a heart attack  Yeah  Cut it  Chip  Chip is on the phone  Hey guys  How you doing  Good  Hi Chip  They really do  Sell those underpants  In the vending machine  That must be  One stinking machine  Right  I would imagine  If it's urine stained  Or whatever  Yeah it'd stink  Yeah you gotta put 
[03:33:00]  A bunch of nickels  In or something  What the heck  You know right  Do you have a question  Yeah I just wanted  To say that the book  Seems very interesting  But you ought to  Do a book about  It was like  Those armed car robberies  Like with the Brinks truck  Or something  You should write a book  About that  That's like the town  The town was good  Remember that one  Yeah they did that  Chuck Hogan wrote a book  About that  It was cool  Yeah  Yeah this one  It sounds good though  About the online poker  Oh thank you  I went on one  What's that 
[03:33:30]  Thanks man  Straight flush  I went on there  And I didn't do too good  My mother was like  Chip are you losing  Your money  I was like  Ma I know what I'm doing  You didn't though  Did you  Nah I lost a lot of money  I thought you got  Your money back  Or something  When you were done  That's ridiculous  Alright thank you  Very much Chip  Hold on a second  I ain't done  I wanted to say  That I think  That the book  Is going to be really good  And what stores  Can I buy it in  Oh you can buy it  In Amazon  And all the bookstores  Is it out now 
[03:34:00]  Today right  Yeah it's out today  It's out today  I don't know  It's out this morning  Nobody seems to know  What's ahead  It's out Chip  It's out now  It's out today  It's called  Straight Flush  Flush by Ben Mesrick  That's right  It seems like  A very good book  Alright  Alright  I think if I want  To go out and get it  It seems like  It will be a very good read  Ben  Okay I'll talk to you  Later Chip  Thank you  Fuck you  Okay goodbye  That's Chip  You never know  Who's going to  Quinn in California  Has a question  What's up Quinn  Hey 
[03:34:30]  I was just  Thinking about  The difference  Between screenplays  And books  And what's your  Opinion on that  I mean it's  Go on  Oh sorry  Yeah it's a very  Different  You know  Industry  A lot of people  Go out to LA  To try and become  Screenwriters  And it's a very  Different form of writing  I've written a couple  Screenplays  I haven't ever gotten  Anything made  Or anything  But I think it's  Different  I love the book  Business  And I think  The screenplay  Business is a lot  More you have to  Meet with people  And talk to people  And it's not  Always on  You just get to  Sit in your room  Yeah you're not  As much of a loner 
[03:35:00]  Like I like to be  But I think  I don't know  It's great  I love movies  You know  And it's just  Such a process  To get a movie made  And there's so many  People get involved  In a screenplay  That by the end  You know  How much of it  Is yours  I don't  You know  It all depends  I don't know  Yeah  Alright  Alright Quinn  Thanks  Any more  Yeah  That's pretty much  Good  Unless I can get  A mixtape  Yeah I'll send you  A mixtape  And I'll send you  A copy of the book  Too  Oh awesome  Alright stay on hold  Quinn  That's Straight Flush  By Ben Majerick  I'm going to send him  A signed copy  Oh nice 
[03:35:30]  So do you feel like  You have to give up  Your books  When they become movies  You know you do  In a large way  When you sell the movie  You kind of lose control  You don't really  Have any control  Right  So once  You have to hope  You sell it to the people  Who will make a good movie  Out of it  And that's where  You have your controls  Picking who you sell it to  Once you accept that check  It's their project  And they can do  Whatever they want with it  So you didn't  You don't  You hung on a little bit  I stay on the set  I consult on the screenplay  I was fortunate  Kevin Spacey  And Dana Burnetti  Who made 21 
[03:36:00]  In the social network  I was very close with them  So I could go  To Hollywood  And be involved  Which was great  But that's kind of  Their prerogative  But that's very unique  I know a lot of screen  You know authors  Who sell their project  And then you know  Just have to wait and see  I'm usually pretty involved  But in the end  They don't really want you  That involved  They want to make the movie  And you have to just trust  That they'll do a good job  I've been very lucky  But sooner or later  I'm sure a bad movie  Will be made  From one of my books  And it'll be a harder  Experience I think  How many possible stories  Are there of people  Like straight flesh  That become billionaires 
[03:36:30]  In college  I wasn't going to  Return to gambling  I had you know  Bringing down the house  Was a long time ago  And ten years ago  I guess  But this story  Because it's online poker  And I feel like  There's this whole  There's hundreds of thousands  Of people who played poker  And suddenly it all went away  And I felt like  There was a cool story there  I think there's a lot  Of true stories  I mean there's everything  You know you read the news  Every day  There's another big story  That would make a great book  For me it has to be  Something no one else  Has really heard about  Or knows about  So it's tricky  But you know  Every year or so  I seem to get another one  But you know  I think there's an infinite  Number of true stories 
[03:37:00]  That are good to write  Yeah yeah yeah  Well obviously you're  I mean look at Wall Street  Wall Street is such a mess  Right  There's a dozen stories  A day there  Of all these people  Cheating other people  And stealing  And big hedge funds  That it turns out  Were built on  You know  Insider trading  I mean those are  All great stories too  So explain Straight Flush  Again because there are  A lot of people  That are just kind of  Tuning in  Straight Flush  Is the true story  Of six frat brothers  Essentially at  University of Montana  Grew up really poor  And one of them  Was so poor  He sold his cow  To buy his first car  And they were  Played poker  In an underground 
[03:37:30]  A basement bar  In Montana  And they decided  To try and put it online  It eventually became  One of the largest  Online poker sites  Called Absolute Poker  Dot com  Which is ridiculous  Because how does a guy  Who's selling a cow  To get a car  Yeah I mean they had  No computer experience  Didn't know anything  About software  They hired people  They did whatever  They could to raise  Enough money  They raised $25,000  And then they raised  $750,000  They moved their frat  To Costa Rica  Essentially  And they built  The whole company  In Costa Rica  Which is the wild west  I mean there was just  You know everything 
[03:38:00]  Is legal there  Everything  There's no law really  How did they know  To go to Costa Rica  Well that's where  All the  A lot of the  Gaming sports betting  Sites were run out of  So you know  If you were to bet  On sports online  It was all out of Costa Rica  So they figured  There was already  Gaming industry there  And it wasn't  Illegal in the United States  But it wasn't legal  It was one of these things  Where you couldn't tell  Whether it was legal  Or not to have  An online poker site  So they chose Costa Rica  So they chose Costa Rica  Also because it's really cheap  You know you could  Get a big house  And live there for nothing  A couple thousand dollars  Or whatever  And they built the company  To a million dollar 
[03:38:30]  A day business  At that one point  They were bringing in  A million dollars a day  Completely unregulated  It's just craziness  And then the US government  Decided it was illegal  And one day in 2011  They shut down  All online poker  Seized all the money  All the players lost their money  And these guys became fugitives  You had to know  It was coming though  Because whether it's legal or not  Like if you figured out a way  To make a million dollars a day  Without declaring it  Somebody's going to figure out a way  To make that illegal  Like somebody's going to come find you  I mean somebody wants taxes on that 
[03:39:00]  And that's essentially what happened  Is that the US government  In the state of New York actually  Said this is not right  And in 2006  There was a bill passed  Which essentially made  What they were doing illegal  So from 2006 to 2011  They knew the clock was ticking  They just got bigger  And bigger and bigger  But they kept going after  It was declared illegal  A lot of companies  Shut down in 2006  They stayed  So that's why they were  Making so much money  Because no one else was around  Right  They were taking a lot of risks  Right  And then what finally  Shut them down  The Department of Justice  Raided everybody  Now we're done 
[03:39:30]  But they can't  So they're not  Coming back to the US  They can't set  One of them turned himself in  And is doing 14 months  In federal prison  One of them refuses to go  And come back  And he's in Antigua  And the rest are in Panama  Costa Rica  How did that guy  Only get 14 months  Well he  Because first of all  He turned himself in  Second of all  The prosecutor told him  He wouldn't get any jail time  Just big fines  And the judge said  No I'm going to make an example  And gave him 14 months  And so these other guys  Are going  Jesus  That's going light on him  But you know  You have to ask  I mean is it worth  Let's say you could keep  A lot of the money 
[03:40:00]  Well a lot of people  If you could keep  50 million dollars  Would you do a year in prison  Most people would probably  Make a decision there  I mean I don't know  It depends on the prison  So this guy does 14 months  But he gets to keep his money  Or no  He had to pay a million dollar fine  Problem was  He wasn't the head  So he didn't have  That kind of money  So the truth is  That he kind of got  He took the fall  He got screwed  Yeah  He's a very nice guy  They're all actually  I got along with all  They're really nice guys  He just  He basically fought  By turning himself in  He could get it  You know get it done with  Be off  He didn't think  He would go to jail 
[03:40:30]  And the other guys  Now seeing that  Are like well  I'm not going to  Turn myself in  Right  Right of course  So does the Department of Justice  Now are they  Well they're trying to negotiate  But they want these guys  To do some jail time  The main guy  The main guy  Is really the one  Who's in Antigua  Who really can't come back  And but at the same time  Online poker is now  Becoming legal  In the state of Nevada  In the state of New Jersey  In Delaware  Online poker is back  To being legal  So the question is  What happens when it's legal everywhere  Can these guys then make a deal  And come back  Right because 
[03:41:00]  You know yeah  I broke a law  But it's not a law anymore  And so you know  That's I think  What the main character  Is hoping for  Is that the government  Becomes reasonable  Because it's stupid  There's no reason  Why online poker  Should be illegal  It's because  They haven't figured out  Because there's too many ways  To do it without  Them getting their taste  Right  We can all line up  For the lottery  But we can't play online poker  Because the lottery  They get their money  That's all it is  It's money  So make a way  For them to pay you  You know regulate it  Tax it  Make an age limit maybe  And then you have online poker  So is the government at all  When they find out 
[03:41:30]  That you're writing this book  And you're going out there  And you're going to talk to them  Does anybody start talking to you  Well I always wondered  You know I always had a lawyer  Ready to go  On my flights  Because I didn't know  If I'd come back  And get taken in customs  And subpoenaed or whatever  I mean I'm  Listen I'm  It's a true story  I'm a journalist  I'm absolutely allowed  To interview people  And write about them  But I certainly could get  Questioned about it  And that's fine  They know where this guy is  He's in Antigua  He just  The government of Antigua  Is protecting him  It's legal there  Why are they protecting him?  It's legal in Antigua  Antigua loves online poker  Online gaming is one of  Their biggest industries  And they don't want 
[03:42:00]  People to be scared off  Being like well  They're letting the US in here  Yeah  I mean they raise  They make a lot of money  Again it's money  But Antigua makes a ton of money  Off of online poker  So I don't know  What's going to happen to this guy  Nobody really knows  Right  But you never  You were never questioned  Or anything  I was not yet  Questioned by anybody  No  But I would assume  Look if he goes to trial  Maybe I'd be subpoenaed  Or something like that  But it wouldn't be like  Wouldn't be a big deal  I mean I'm  I'm just writing the story  Have you been subpoenaed before?  I have amazingly not  I have not  Everything's been great 
[03:42:30]  You know I  The Facebook story went off  And it was awesome  And everything's  You know as long as  You're writing it  The way I write  I'm very clear about it  I write a thriller  That's based on true stuff  You know I create it  Like an action sort of story  But it is  Everything in it  Actually happens  So that's where  Kind of you protect yourself  And are you thinking now  Like what type of movie  Does this make?  I think this would be  An awesome movie  There's a lot of young stars  That would be great  And I think it'll be  A cool movie  Is that part of your  Writing style though?  Like the intention is  Absolutely  And when I sit down  To write a book now  I'm thinking who's going to 
[03:43:00]  You know  Not specific actors  But I visualize it as a movie  Right right right  Because it's all  One and the same for me  I just love movies  I love television  And when I write  I want my book to read like that  Do you wish they wouldn't  Change your titles all the time?  My titles  I know I get screwed on the titles  Yeah that's what I was thinking  I've been screwed over and over again  The social network totally screwed me  Because Accident of the Billionaires  You know nobody really realized  It was the social network  That's what I was saying  Like you could probably  Sell more books  A lot more  Yeah  You know what  It's a different industry  When you sell your project  They're like oh this title doesn't work  Let's change it  And you're like oh god  So you put out a paperback 
[03:43:30]  With the new title or whatever  But yeah it's always very difficult  Because people would probably  See Accident of the Billionaires  And be like what  They just rip off the social network  Right  They just wrote a book  Ripping it off  Absolutely  And bringing it on the house  The problem was  There was that Queen Latifah movie  Right  Bringing it on the house  No it's the  It's not duh  It's duh  It's the  It's different  No  Right  Let's go to James in New York  What's up James  Hey I want some free shit  That's it?  I just want some free shit  Alright well I gotta respect that  Then how about a copy of Straight Flush 
[03:44:00]  Yeah that's cool  I'll pick it up  That's where my right hand is  Where is it?  Steering wheel you sick fuck  Alright  Alright  Alright have a good day  Thank you James  Thank you very much  Is it  Is it  Do you  Do you kind of  Assume  That it's going to be a bestseller  Or is there still  Jitters  I mean you know it all  You never know  Whether a book's going to do really well or not  But do you care?  I do care  I mean you want people to like your book  You want people to read your book  And a book like this is kind of aimed at my audience  You know Straight Flush  It's the people who like bringing down the house 
[03:44:30]  And are into poker  And that kind of world of young people making lots of money  So I hope it will do as well as my other books  But you never know until it comes out  A lot of it just depends on how the word gets out there  And whether you know  It just  Nobody really knows what's going to make a bestseller or not  Do you get bored  When you don't have a book  Like when you're just living your life  I'm not like smuggling money  I'm not going to weird sex clubs  Yeah you know  There's a real high to the research stage of a book like this  Yeah  When you're getting inside of it  The writing itself is miserable  Nobody likes writing 
[03:45:00]  Like sitting there and writing 10 pages in a day  Is just awful  Yeah  You want to just die the whole time  But when you're researching the book  It's very exciting  It's thrilling  And then when the book comes out  It's just all anxiety  Can you just be like a research assistant?  I mean I don't have any assistants  I always  Take notes  People always try and become my assistant  But I don't want to take responsibility  For someone ending up in Costa Rica  In some whorehouse  And two in the morning  It's one of those crazy worlds  Where I like to just go in  And do it as part of the scene  And so  Yeah the research is fun  It's harder as I get older 
[03:45:30]  Because I'm not the college kid anymore  Right  You know running around with these guys  Who are like  You know  It's physically more demanding  But it's pretty cool  Are you married or single?  I have kids  I'm married  I'm an old man now  Two little babies  Yeah  That has to be even stranger though  Because you go home  And your wife is like  You know  Well my wife makes sure  That I don't do the stories  That are really over the top  You've already done them  I don't get to write about  Whorehouses anymore  No I  My wife's great  She's awesome  And it's very different  Being at this stage of my life 
[03:46:00]  Writing these stories  Than it was then  But at the same time  I feel like I have a little bit more  Of an objective view  From outside now  Because when you're  You know 25  Writing these stories  It's like  Oh this is cool  This is awesome  This is cool  Let's go you know  Drive Ferraris  And race them down this road  Now you're like  Man I might crash  You know  It's like a different feel  So is there a part of you now  That is like  This is a lot of fun  I'm glad that I get to go home soon  Right  Is there a big story  About someone who like  Lives in a big house  And doesn't do anything  No you know  I try and  I take more care  I'm much more careful now  The travel is much less fun now 
[03:46:30]  I mean I don't want to  Hop on a plane every day anymore  You don't  No I used to love travel  Now it's like  I like travel  But two days I'm fine  Because I'd be thinking  You know you go home  And you're like  Could you take out the trash  Yeah well that's  No  I just was in Antigua  It is weird when you go from like  You're at somebody's  30 million dollar mansion  Driving dune buggies  And then you get home  And it's like  Yeah I'm watching Mad Men  And you're like  It's such a different lifestyle  Right  When you're on the road  Doing a show  Doing a book like this  And when you're back home  But you know what  There's  I love both aspects of my life  I'm lucky to have both  And that's the other thing  Do you watch shows 
[03:47:00]  Like Mad Men  Stuff like that  I do  But do you sit there watching them  Like this is not as compelling  As the things I've seen  No  Sometimes I'll watch a show  Like Vegas or something like that  Where Vegas was on  And you watch it  And be like  Wow I've seen stuff  Crazier than that  But overall  I'm a big fan of television  I love shows like  I mean  Walking Dead is amazing  Breaking Bad  And then  What's the one  Game of Thrones  I'm obsessed with  So it's like  No I'm a big fan of television  What was crazier  Seeing the  Kind of  Underground  Inner workings of Vegas  Or the 
[03:47:30]  Seedy  Underbelly of Japan  The seedy  Underbelly of Japan  Is more disturbing  Than anything you'll ever see  Anywhere else  You think so  I mean what goes on  There's one district  It's been a long time  The sex district essentially  Where there's something like  50,000 women employed  In the sex industry  In one area  And it's like  I mean the scale of it  Is unreal  And then you  Vegas is  But Vegas how it works  Underground is pretty cool too  But it's much more like Disney  Vegas is like Walt Disney  For adults  Everything is very much  Under control  They know exactly 
[03:48:00]  What they're doing  It's not like  The movie casino  No  They study the scent  In the casino  The olfactory  What the chemicals  In the air  It's studied  What makes you gamble more  I mean the carpeting  It's studied  To what color  The carpeting should be  There's a lot going on  Behind the scenes  That's very cool  But it's much like  It's like an industry  When you go to Japan  Or you know  Costa Rica  For instance  It's like whoa  I mean it's like  Wild West  It's like there's  Nobody in control here  Yeah yeah yeah  It's people riding around  On motorcycles with guns  So are these places in Japan  Are they sort of like  Tucked away  You can't see them  Or people know 
[03:48:30]  What they're going to  You know where to go  I mean  But as an American  No you will not  Find your way in  Japanese men know  Yeah  Yeah yeah  But the American men  Don't find them  I mean you can find  The ones in Roppongi  In the Americans  But those cater to Americans  And it's not the same thing  Right right right  Let me go to  I like that we went in  This interview  Went in the  Ugly Americans direction  But that's  I guess you never know  Where it's going to go  Maybe that book  Will come back  Right you never know  And that's your fault  For writing all these  Crazy books  I know  It's true  I like it  I like it  I'm a fan  Let's go to Michael 
[03:49:00]  He's up in Calgary  What's up Michael  Hey congratulations  Sam you finally had a good show  Because Ben Nezert's on  He's awesome  I was curious  Thank you  Thank you Ben  What happened to  The Russian card counter  From the early book  From Breaking Vegas  That's so funny  So I wrote a book  Called Busting Vegas  Which was a sequel  To Bring Down the House  That less people read  But it was about  A Russian guy  Semyon Dukacs  Was his name  Who was known as  The Darling of Las Vegas  In the 90s  He was the largest  Biggest card counter  In the world  And he had a system  Where he could cut to aces  So he could get aces 
[03:49:30]  To come out  When he wanted them to  It's actually a real system  It's actually amazing  Wow  You use the cut card  You know they offer you  The cut card  You can actually cut  And manipulate the deck  So he would do this  He made a ton of money  I actually was just  Last week  At a poker game  At like a charity poker game  And he was sitting next to me  I hadn't seen Semyon  In six years  Great guy  He's now  He's made a fortune  But he's sitting next to you  At a poker game  Well I didn't want to play poker  I was like yeah  I'm going to lose here  But he made a fortune  In the internet company  Sold three internet companies  And now he invests 
[03:50:00]  In internet companies  So he made a fortune  It's amazing that somebody  Can make a reputation  For manipulating card games  Right  And then still play card games  Right  But there's anybody left  That would play poker with him  Well he couldn't play blackjack  Anywhere in the world  That guy  I was in the win with him  We got kicked chased out  By three very large men  I was playing  And he was doing  He cut to an ace twice  He hit an ace twice  On purpose  Won $75,000  In maybe ten minutes  And then we look back  And there were like  Three large men coming out  And he's like  We have to go  We have to go  We got out there  Have you ever gotten pulled back 
[03:50:30]  Where they break people's thumbs  With hammers  I've been in a back room before  But nobody broke my  I mean they knew who I was  The back room is the place  You don't want to go  And in Vegas  If you're caught card counting  They try and bring you  To the back room  But really they sit you down  They might stand you up  Against the wall  Photograph you  Make you sign something  That says you'll never come back  But they won't beat you up anymore  But you're scared  Well you never really know  Because you don't know  I'll tell you  Atlantic City is way more  Frightening than Vegas  It is  Atlantic City is first of all  Can be terrifying in general  But you go down to the parking lot  In Atlantic City  And you know  Some private eye 
[03:51:00]  Who works for the casino  Who knows what will happen to you  In Vegas it's like Disney  Like I say  They don't want a lawsuit  So like once you're out  Of the building  Yeah  But Vegas it's all  One big play land  But Atlantic City  Is not all one big play land  You know  Once you walk outside  Of the casino in Atlantic City  You're in no man's life  Still like Nucky Thompson  Walking around  Did you actually count cards yourself?  I know how  I would be like a gorilla player  They would call me into decks  So they would signal me  And I would do what they signal me  Wow  Yeah  I'm not great at math  My math is not as good as theirs  Yeah  That would probably be 
[03:51:30]  Did you like that part?  You say like writing the book  Right  Is the hard part  Because you're sitting there  And you just have to write  And you know the ending  You know where you want to go  Right  And you just want to get there  But it's the exercise of writing  When you have to learn  How to count cards  Is that actually fun?  Well that was fun  It's the best  The problem is to get good at it  You've got to practice  Three hours a day for months  Which I didn't have time to do  But the learning how to do it  Is really fun  And I can still play perfect blackjack  I can say  You know  I just don't count  But you know  Blackjack  The thing about card counting  Is you have to play like 48 hours  To make it worthwhile 
[03:52:00]  Because the changes in the deck  Are so enormous  That sitting down and playing  For 10 minutes  Is not going to do you any good  So you're just sitting there  Like little bit  Little bit  Little bit  Little bit  Yeah  If you're sitting there  For 10 minutes  Like the deck may just be bad  The whole 10 minutes  Right  Even if it gets good  Your odds are still only 2%  Over the house  Isn't it crazy with Straight Flush  And Straight Flush  Is a book that's out today  Right  But they didn't even do anything wrong  Well I mean I guess  They probably should have stopped  They knew  Listen these guys  Online poker became illegal in 2006  Yeah  So by staying in the industry  After that  You know  But it was gray area still 
[03:52:30]  It was wrongly illegal essentially  Because there were a lot of people  Who were saying  Well poker is a game of skill  It's not a game of luck  It's not pure gambling  There's no reason  That this law should apply  And that a law  Harkened back to sports betting  So it wasn't really about poker  But they definitely  Were taking risks after 2006  But they didn't screw anybody over  Or anything  No  Well these guys  And a lot of people  Dislike these guys  Or I like them  But there was a cheating scandal  In the midst of their empire  Yeah  At one point  A bunch of players  Did get cheated  By someone on the inside 
[03:53:00]  Who  And then they paid those guys back  But there was a cheating scandal  So a lot of people  Did feel like these guys  Were you know  Doing stuff  But in the end  When people lost their money  When the government  Shut it down  It wasn't because of these guys  It was because the government  Shut down the industry  Right  Some companies had enough cash  To pay the players  These companies  Did not have enough cash  To pay the players  So the players got screwed  And they blamed the guys  But it wasn't really up to  I mean I'm assuming  If they could keep their business open  Right  They would choose to keep  Their business open  There's very few companies  In the world 
[03:53:30]  That you could shut down today  And they'd have enough money  To pay all of their people  Who they owed money to  I mean half the time  When concerts get cancelled  Sorry  I mean who has the cash  The cash isn't sitting there anymore  Right  And I think players thought  Well the cash must be sitting  In some bank  Well no that's not what happens  And when you put your money  In an actual bank  That's not what happens  I think we learned that  In It's a Wonderful Life  Right  Well your money's  In Phil's house  Right  It's like it's in a big pile  We put your money in a pile  So people were very upset  But I think they aimed  Their anger at the wrong people  Right  I gotcha  Let me go to Sean in Alabama 
[03:54:00]  What's up Sean  Hey Sam  Morning  Morning  Two things I was going to ask  One  Ben what's he working on next  For his projects  And two  I was wondering if I could get  A copy of Straight Flush  Out in the bookstores  Now Amazon.com  We'll find a copy for you  Yeah you've got to get a copy  Now after that good plug  I am working on a couple projects  One is a big fiction thriller project  Which I'm doing  Which I just sold a movie to  But I can't really go into it  And then another is  Another big non-fiction book  I don't really talk about  What I'm writing before  Because right now 
[03:54:30]  I'm in the stage of  Getting inside the story  Right  Sometimes it makes it harder  To get inside the story  When I'm talking about it  But this is  You know I also  This book  Straight Flush  Will probably be a movie as well  So I think I'll get  To work on that as well  And is the last movie  Is the last book  Going to be a movie  Sex on the Moon  We sold that to Sony  And they're developing it  With Kevin Spacey  Dana Brady and Scott Rudin  Attached  And Mike DeLuca  So the same people  Who did the social network  Are developing it  That's good news  Yeah we'll see what happens  You know with movies  You sell it and then  You wait  Right  So hopefully it'll get  But at least the people 
[03:55:00]  Attached to it  Are people you trust  Solid people  Yeah  All right Sean  I'm going to put you  On hold  We'll find something  For you  Thank you  All right buddy  Let's go to Mike  In Boston  Hey Sam  What's up buddy  Ben  I've definitely  I've read all your books  And the one thing  That I do  Do  And might make me  A total nerd  Is  I get them all  On Audible  Because I drive  A lot to work  And I listen  To all your books  And I know  You seem to write  Like kind of a movie  Sort of in mind  But the Audible books 
[03:55:30]  And I'm really not  Into like a big  Like audio book guy  But holy shit  Like I listen to them  All like beginning to end  They're just amazing  Is there going to be  An audio version of this  Yeah I think there's  An audio book of this one  I don't know who's doing it  I remember my last book  Sex on the Moon  I think  It was the  Affleck brother did it  Colin  Casey  Casey Affleck  Oh really  Did the audio book of it  This one I don't know  Who's going to do it  I assume it's an audio book  Already  But I don't know  Who did it or whatever  I used to do them  I did a couple of mine  That was hard work  I like it 
[03:56:00]  Actors do it  I like reading this  Less than I liked writing it  No I mean you have to  Read every line  Like ten times in the studio  It's like awful  But I'm glad someone's  Listening to them  That's cool  And in Boston too  I live in Boston  How do you end up  Getting Casey Affleck  To do your book  You know they just  The publisher  You know offered it to him  And he read it  And liked it  And you know he gets paid  I don't know what he gets paid  Yeah sure but still  It's good news  It was cool  Yeah  It was really cool to listen to  A Boston accent  Did you listen back to it  I listened to a part of it  Because yeah I thought  He has a great voice  Do you ever read your books  Well the problem is 
[03:56:30]  When you're writing it  You read it so many times  But when it comes out  I reread this one  Before it came out  Simply because  I was going to do  A lot of press  So I wanted to make sure  I knew what was in the book  But yeah I mean  I'm pretty  Ten years later  I'll sit down  And read a book again  I just read it  Bring it down the house again  And you're sitting there  Like I am a damn good author  I am awesome  It's more like  I don't remember  Ever writing this  When did this happen  It was crazy  So are you  Because you said  You're working on  The other thing now  You're kind of in it  Well yeah  For these two weeks  I'll be here in New York  Just running around  Doing press  But when I 
[03:57:00]  You know  Yeah pretty much  I'm on airplanes  Going to bizarre places  And that's why  You've got to start  Reading this again  Because your mind's  In the other thing  Whatever the other thing is  Think about something  That'll get us all killed  And I'm sure  You'll be back here for it  Let me go to Bob  In Connecticut  Bob  Hi how you doing  Good  I want to know  If he knows about  Phil Ivey  And what his situation  Was with his poker site  Phil Ivey  You know there was  Something going  I was just reading about it  I don't  You might know more  Details than I do  I think  I don't even know  If I'm good enough  To speak about that 
[03:57:30]  What do you know  I don't know  I just know  That they  They shut down his site  And they're going after him  For you know  I guess not paying people back  Yeah they're going after  I think they called it  Like a Ponzi scheme  Right  They said that  It was a pyramid scheme  Or something  I don't know the details of it  I should look into it  But I don't know  What happened there  But you know  A couple of the  Big name poker players  Were involved with  Absolute Poker  And some of these other sites  And they did get in trouble  When the thing went down  It was tricky  Like with bringing down the house  I was getting calls  From these poker sites  Offering you tons of money 
[03:58:00]  To be a face  Of whatever poker company it was  And I remember talking  To my agent at the time  Going  I can make like a million dollars  Hawking an online poker site  Yeah  And they're like  Stay away  Stay away  They knew it was going to come down  But they didn't know  But nobody knew  But now it's coming back  And now it's becoming legal again  There's a $10 billion industry  Just waiting for people  To open a company  Everyone wants to play  Back then when your agents  Was it just one of those things  Saying this  This can't be legal  It's legal  But it can't  It's unclear 
[03:58:30]  Yeah  Whether it's legal or not  Do you want to take a risk  And it's  I always ask people  What would you risk  To go to jail  I mean if someone said  I'll give you $10 million  Where you're going to spend  The next year in prison  Would you do it  Plus you're in this scenario  Where you're like  Actually I'll probably  Just write about them instead  And make my money that way  I sell a movie  It's a tricky question  You also got to be an expert now  Like this guy calls up  Asks you about something  In the world  That you're writing about  That was something  That I should know about  I know that he got  I know he said  Denied it was a Ponzi scheme 
[03:59:00]  And they said  It was a Ponzi scheme  But I don't know  What the answer is  Are you doing any signings  I'm doing something  In New Jersey  Tomorrow night  And I'm doing something  At Bryant Park  Tomorrow day  At 1230  In the Bryant Park  Reading room  And then tomorrow night  At a big bookstore  In New Jersey  Which are  You have a website  Where the dates are  It would be on  I will tweet it  At Ben Mesrick  Okay  It's at Ben Mesrick  At Ben  At Ben Mesrick dot com  Ben Mesrick dot com  Yeah  Yeah  We got Ben Mesrick dot com  Yeah  Twitter dot com
