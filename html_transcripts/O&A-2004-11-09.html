<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous segment lampooning Jim Norton's tardiness, featuring producer Ben's exasperated reactions.  The hosts then launched into a satirical discussion of the Iraq War, specifically Operation Dawn, using crude analogies about trick-or-treating and children's shopping sprees to mock the U.S.'s involvement.  Donald Rumsfeld's press conference was also criticized, comparing his aggressive demeanor to that of Bill Parcells.  A significant portion focused on harshly criticizing marathon runner Zoe Kaplowitz for allegedly intentionally finishing last to gain attention.  Martini Steve, a show producer, joined the studio to discuss the show's promotional spots, which were heavily criticized for their excessive violence against women, homophobic themes, and general violence.  Numerous examples were played and analyzed, with crude and explicit commentary and listener calls expressing both agreement and dissent.  A homophobic skit called “Fag Talk,” featuring Bob the Fag Expert, was also included.

The show continued with a bizarre phone call from a seemingly blind, epileptic caller who fell asleep and then fell during the conversation.  The hosts then shifted to their difficulties booking A-list celebrities (George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp) for their XM Satellite Radio show, contrasting their edgy humor with the expectations of XM's corporate overlords.  They mocked corporate jargon like "blue sky," "tee it up," and "circle back," with listener participation.  A humorous, potentially offensive bit involving a caller’s mother being tricked into believing her son was jailed for being with prostitutes, one of whom had AIDS, followed.  The difficulties in booking celebrities continued to be discussed, interspersed with calls about squirting during sex and an anecdote about a midget gas station attendant, along with various sound bites and musical interludes.

The next segment began with a discussion about a governor's coming-out speech, focusing on the shock value and his wife's seemingly emotionless response.  A call from Shannon in Ohio about “squirting” led to a detailed discussion of female ejaculation.  This transitioned into listener calls describing humorous "midget sightings," followed by a caller detailing the chemical composition of female ejaculate.  Anthony's aversion to sticky substances sparked a comedic tangent on various sticky textures.  Audio clips from the governor's speech were interspersed with the hosts' crude and homophobic commentary.  A call from Ashley in Pennsylvania, who confessed to sleeping with her father's 38-year-old best friend, led to an on-air confrontation with her mother, Janice.  The segment concluded with discussion of the call's veracity, a brief appearance by a studio guest ("Master Poe") who cleaned up a coffee spill, and a mention of upcoming guests.

A further segment began with a recap of the Ashley/Janice phone call and discussion of dating much younger women.  Dom, a studio guest, shared anecdotes about his infidelity. This transitioned into Jim Norton's stand-up routine, including jokes about dating a girl who grew taller and a dark bit about child molestation.  Dom discussed his work at Bananas Comedy Club, leading to humorous exchanges.  The segment also included anecdotes about Rodney Dangerfield's funeral and other comedians.  A lengthy, comedic song about internet pornography was played, followed by a call from 9/11 conspiracy theorist Jonathan Gold, resulting in a heated debate with the hosts.  Crude and offensive language, sexually suggestive humor, and discussions of infidelity were prevalent throughout.

The final segment featured a continued, heated debate with Jonathan Gold, who presented his 9/11 conspiracy theories, including a flight manifest supposedly showing Khalil bin Laden's departure.  The hosts aggressively challenged his claims using insults like "left-wing psychopath" and "fucking idiot,"  leading to Gold hanging up.  The conversation continued on the motivations behind 9/11, dismissing the Israeli angle.  A Jägermeister representative arrived with a dispensing machine and promotional items, leading to lighthearted banter and Jägermeister shots.  Calls followed, including further vulgarity and offensive remarks.  The show ended with mentions of upcoming events, including a Jägermeister tour and more discussion of Hustler Magazine's involvement.  A final call detailed a bizarre anecdote about a woman aroused only by Jewish cowboys.

[00:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:05:00]  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock? 
[00:05:30]  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I tell you, there's something phony going on.  Am I being fired?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's all you got today? 
[00:06:00]  That's all you got today?  Hey, that's all you got, Anthony.  That's all you got, Anthony.  That's all you got, Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jim Norton.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America slowly but surely.  Wow.  Big hi to everyone that turned on.  Big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios yesterday, I guess.  This is the first time you're hearing us.  The new version of the Opie and Anthony show, getting more gooder every day.  Opie and Anthony Mark 2.  Mark 2.  I hope you enjoy our new direction. 
[00:06:30]  No, this is Opie and Anthony 3.0.  Yeah.  This is the third version of the Opie and Anthony show.  And the last version, I do believe.  The last.  It's over after this.  We get our asses thrown out of here.  That's it.  I'm done.  We will screw up again, and that will be it.  So enjoy the ride, motherfuckers.  Figure out a retirement plan.  That's right.  Very surprised to see Jimmy here.  He woke up so late.  You got Ben so bad.  Ben was so stressed out that Jimmy was going to be so late today because he woke up late. 
[00:07:00]  Ben called him, and he was still in bed at, what?  10 to 6?  5 to 6?  Yeah, Ben got a call, what, only 10 minutes ago?  No, I called Jim, and I was, because if he's not here by quarter of, I call him.  He calls me, and I'm like, hello?  He's like, dude, are you coming?  I'm like, I just woke up.  I'll call you back.  He got a good.  Ben came running in here like, Ben all herky-jerky.  Jim's going to be late.  I just woke him up.  And then two seconds later, Jim walks in the studio door.  Ben with his hurricane hair comes flying through the door. 
[00:07:30]  We got a problem.  We got a problem.  Ben looking all confused when Jim walked in the door.  Right.  But I just spoke with him, and then he walks in the, and I.  It was good.  You sounded like you had just woken up.  You're like, oh, dude, fuck.  What time?  You go, what time is it?  What time is it?  Where were you?  I was in the elevator.  I was between 4 and I was seeing 5 approach.  He nailed you.  I love that.  I did sleep late today, but that's, you know.  It's classic, too, because Ben's freaking out, and then I look at each other like, yeah,  whatever. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, well.  He'll be here.  He'll be here.  We're all going to do it one day.  Yeah.  I don't doubt that each and every one of us at some point during our tenure here.  I got backup plans already, though, man.  What do you mean?  Because I panic now.  Because if the lights go out, I'm done.  Oh, I never thought of that.  Lights go out, done.  Alarm clock's not going off.  So now I got my cell phone set.  But now I'm going to get a battery-operated alarm clock, because...  Get the old wind-up ones.  Oh, yeah.  All night long. 
[00:08:30]  I used to have one of those.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Oh, you want to heave them across the room.  So here we are.  Another day.  I want to say thanks to all the listeners.  I mean, the listeners, this version of the show getting very, very active with rebuilding  the Opie and Anthony show.  Because we'll talk about something we used to have on the old show that we don't have.  Next thing you know, the email is packed with the things we need to make this show more  gooder.  Like, someone sent us the Orson Welles clip.  I know. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, we wanted to whack off.  We were so excited about this.  You know, the listeners, more gooder this time around.  More gooder listeners.  Don't tell me, don't tell me, your headphones, Opie, are clipping, and now you have to put  it in the other jack.  It's like a ritual every morning.  And every day they have a new solution that's not working.  It just doesn't work?  The new solution is it's static electricity.  So they got this static spray.  The ass spray.  The ass spray.  Anti-static spray. 
[00:09:30]  And Ben was all over the studio.  He should use that crap on his hair to calm it down.  It might be Ben's hair that's affecting it.  You think that's making all the static electricity in here?  But the weird thing is I move my headphones to this other jack and I'm fine.  I got an idea.  Yeah.  Why don't they take that jack that you plug into every morning?  And make it my jack.  And put it over there and make it your jack.  No.  I think it has something to do with this jack being too close.  Oh, you think? 
[00:10:00]  Ben, can we use the anti-static spray on your hair and see what happens?  Put some ass in your hair.  I'm reporting here from a windlass corridor.  This stuff actually does the trick.  Oh, it didn't?  You had to switch headphones already?  Yeah.  So it didn't work.  I lasted about four minutes today and then all of a sudden it just started clipping.  That doesn't work.  That's good if you're putting on a belt bomb.  Honestly, it's going to help my stammering.  You're ready to walk into a bus.  It'll help my stammering because all of a sudden the headphones will go out and I stop. 
[00:10:30]  And then I pop back.  Anyway, what do you want to start with?  We've got so much stuff today that I'm a little confused.  Oh, we have McGreevy audio.  We watched his little speech last night.  I was watching the new war show, which I'm so glad is back after the election.  What a coincidence.  You know, all during the campaign, the war show wasn't that fun.  You turn on CNN or Fox News and they didn't even report on it.  A few Marines died, which is tragic. 
[00:11:00]  But no attacks, no anything.  It's almost like Bush didn't want to do anything in Iraq for almost eight months while he campaigned and just left them to their devices.  I bow to you because you said this.  You said the day after he's reelected, all hell's going to break loose again.  And certainly it has.  And that's what happened.  Opie, we're in, I believe this is episode four, the Phantom Fury.  Is that what they're calling this one?  They were calling it the Phantom Fury.  Operation Phantom Fury, but they had to change the name, right? 
[00:11:30]  Why?  Why did they have to change the name?  It's another cool American war operation name, Phantom Fury.  You know, we always come up with the good ones.  Desert Storm.  You know, those are some cool, strong sounding things.  Now it's called the Dawn, Operation Dawn, because the Iraqis, Opie, contrary to popular belief,  the Iraqis are in charge of this operation.  You watch the news? 
[00:12:00]  It's amazing.  The Iraqis are invading Fallujah, the Iraqi, the new Iraqi army.  It's just with American support.  We're just helping them out.  It's kind of like taking your kids trick-or-treating.  Right.  You make the kids feel like, you know, they're in charge and they got everything under control.  They got their candy sack and they got their costumes.  And notice when a bunch of kids go trick-or-treating, they all have different costumes on,  kind of like the Iraqi army.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it looks like.  It looks like they're dressed up to trick-or-treat. 
[00:12:30]  And there's mom and dad pushing them toward the houses.  No, they're in control.  Go on.  They're going to ring the doorbell and they're going to do that trick-or-treat thing and  they're going to get a little goody and they're going to move on to the next house.  But where are the parents?  Right on the curb with their eyes, you know, glued on their kids, making sure that they  get the job done.  You ever go to the store when you're a kid and you want to buy something and it's yours?  You go to Toys R Us.  Your parents take you there and stuff.  And they go, okay.  You get up to the register and they give you the money. 
[00:13:00]  Now give this to the lady.  And you get the tan and you're like, here.  And then she's like, oh, here's your change.  And gives it back to the kid like he's making the transaction.  Right.  It's his sale.  It's his purchase.  That's what we're doing with Iraq, Opie.  The Iraqi army is going in there and they showed them last night celebrating some of the Iraqi  army.  They're all wearing different kind of cami uniforms, different helmets.  Some of them not wearing anything.  They got their guns that they're waving in the air like they just don't care. 
[00:13:30]  They're rifles.  They're rifles.  They're waving them in the air.  They look like the same savages that are wrapped up in bed sheets firing mortars at our  guys, only they're wearing kind of more westernized uniforms.  Yeah.  Don't let them bullshit you.  We're running the show there.  It's our operation.  And we had to change a cool Star Wars sounding name like Phantom Fury for something like Dawn  because it's what the Iraqis came up. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, you want to name the operation?  Okay.  What do you want to call it?  Well, it's the dawning of a new day for the Iraqis.  That's what I think it is.  It's Al-Fayyid or something.  It's not even Dawn.  We translated it.  But it's some Arab name that sounds like kill every American.  Probably kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  But I was watching some of the clips, a limited video coming out of this operation, but it  was kind of fun.  It looked like a video game. 
[00:14:30]  You had troops, American troops with some heavy armor rolling in columns.  And then they showed the insurgents wearing dresses, which they like to wear for some  reason.  They wear these big, long bed sheet dresses, throwing these mortars, I guess, into pipes  that are just shoved in the street.  Looks like it's going to be a fierce battle.  It's going to take a long time.  If we don't clean this up in three days, I'd be surprised.  Three days?  Bush has four years now.  It's going to take this time.  He's got to really milk it.  But there's other cities they've got to go to. 
[00:15:00]  It's city to city to city.  I understand.  And where the hell has Donald Rumsfeld been?  All of a sudden, he pops back up in the news out of nowhere.  That old curmudgeon.  They paraded him out last night in front of the press, and he's as angry as ever.  They brought him out and asked him, you know, hey, where have you been?  And he said, you know, they've told me to keep my head down for the election.  I haven't been involved in the election process, he said.  But so he got out there, and they started asking him questions about how long this is going to take.  Is this a final push for the liberation of Iraq? 
[00:15:30]  And he's just, no, it's not the final push.  Are you listening to the question you're asking me?  He's back to being an ass.  He's back to being just the biggest son of a bitch behind a podium.  And I've got to tell you, it's entertaining as hell to watch.  Yeah.  They're asking him questions about the war, questions about himself.  He goes, they asked him, are you going to stay on board as the Secretary of Defense under George Bush?  And he's like, me and the President haven't discussed that. 
[00:16:00]  He goes, you think I'm just going to discuss it with the press first?  Come on.  He goes, come on.  Come on.  He's just, and I'm fixated on the TV.  You think the Democrats would have entertaining people like this in front of you on TV?  No.  And then he's like, they were kind of, again, criticizing the whole operation.  And Rumsfeld leans, leans on the podium, looks at the guy with just contempt, and goes, they're chopping people's heads off over there.  Yeah, they are. 
[00:16:30]  And then what a coincidence he's on to do.  But he just is angry as ever.  And I love it.  I cannot get enough of Donald Rumsfeld on TV.  He's like the Parcells of the government.  He gets, what do you ask?  On the other TV is Bill Parcells.  Ah, look at that.  And that TV is Donald Rumsfeld.  They're the same person.  I love, yeah, both of them.  They just, next question, you're an idiot.  Right, right, right.  And no qualms about calling people stupid.  I hope they have a better game plan than the Cowboys over there in Iraq, though. 
[00:17:00]  Your Cowboys stink this year.  That's all right.  They're still my Cowboys, and I like them win, lose, or draw.  Oh, wink, wink.  Win, lose, or draw.  I'm no Fairweather fan.  Amen, Ant.  Good point.  You're not going to start following another team?  I've been kind of rooting for the Jets, but you know I've always been a bit of a jerk.  Oh, my God.  Chad went down, though.  Rooting?  You were rooting?  Did you have the little pennants on a stick, waving it around?  It says, Go Jets on this little...  A little triangle pennant on a stick?  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets. 
[00:17:30]  You know, my dad went on a business trip to Minnesota and brought home a Minnesota Twins,  one of those tiny little triangle flags, and I all of a sudden became a Twins fan because  of that for a while.  Oh, I couldn't name one Twins player.  I had one from Vermont that my father brought me back from Vermont.  Just for the state.  You became a fan of cheese?  I know.  That would be Wisconsin, wouldn't it?  Go, no blacks.  There's the joke.  Vermont does some cheese things, though.  Chad Pennington is out for a month, man. 
[00:18:00]  Really?  Yeah, we're...  Ouch.  We're effed.  We're effed.  Shut up, Ben.  Whatever.  Go Pats.  I know.  Go Pats.  He's giggling over there.  His hair all awry.  Well, you know how it is in New England.  All that cheese.  What?  Dude, Vermont cheese, you ass.  Cheddar cheese.  Vermont makes cheese?  Yeah.  When?  I buy Vermont cheddar cheese every time I'm in a supermarket.  I like going to Wisconsin for maple syrup.  All right. 
[00:18:30]  The maple syrup would have been a little better, I guess.  Vermont makes cheese, do they?  Yeah, they do.  I don't even have a clue enough to goof on you if they don't.  They really don't.  It wasn't the best example.  I understand that.  But they do make cheese.  Do they export textiles?  Let me look.  Textiles.  It is too early to be that accurate.  All right.  Just go with me here.  Is that our excuse every day?  Oh, without a doubt.  It's too early to be accurate.  It's too early to be accurate.  Just go with it and understand and nod your head.  That's your job as the listener. 
[00:19:00]  Just make believe we're brainiacs.  Sure.  In other news, Anthony, we've got to get Steve in here in a few minutes.  Oh, yeah.  In other news, you know, I hate this Zoe bitch.  I hate her.  I hate her.  I hate her.  She's been doing this for years, and no one's on to her game.  It's a gimmick.  This started when we were working in Boston.  She'd be the last person to cross the line at the Boston Marathon, and now she just kind  of goes to these big marathons across America, and she is the last person to cross the line 
[00:19:30]  every single year, and the media does not pick up on this, and they act like she's doing  it for the first time.  It's so brave and courageous that she's completing this, the drive she has.  Look, she has MS, but she's an attention getter, all right?  I mean, someone has to call her out on this, okay?  Last one home and proud of it.  Here it is again, the last runner home in this year's New York City Marathon.  They ran the New York City Marathon Sunday morning.  Sunday.  Sunday morning, okay?  The last runner home, first of all, it's not a runner. 
[00:20:00]  She walks the whole thing.  I think if you're not running the race, you should be disqualified.  That's what the marathon was all about.  It's a running, it's a race.  Yeah.  Okay?  Good point.  The last runner home in this year's New York City Marathon finished in a record slow time  of 29 hours and 15 minutes yesterday morning.  But MS sufferer Zoe Kaplowitz believes she's a winner, everybody. 
[00:20:30]  She does this every year, and she purposely makes sure she's the last one to cross the line,  and that's what I have a problem with.  She's not really running the race and just happens to be the slowest runner.  Her whole goal is to cross the line last so she gets the attention.  Yeah.  And you could say whatever you want because she has MS and stuff, but she's an attention  getter.  Does she actually, let me ask you a question, does she actually go the whole time or does  she take a break?  I can't picture someone with MS, that awful walk they do, the leg drag, doing 29 hours 
[00:21:00]  of walking.  I'm certain there are breaks in there.  And you know what?  There's people that are, you know, they want to go home, you know, but it's all about her.  And you've got the cops, the NYPD, they have to follow the last runners in and make sure  no one else is on the course.  Yeah.  So now these cops have to sit around for 29 hours as she's slowly but surely making  her way around the course.  How brave.  They probably love the OT and we love paying for it.  The 56-year-old veteran of 17 consecutive New York marathons crossed the Central Park  finish line at 10.30 a.m. yesterday, Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  And then here's the quote, it's not always about being first, it's about giving it everything  you've got, and I certainly did that, she told the Post, she did it.  Everything she's got.  Does it always have to be about being last?  Turn up legs?  I've really had enough of this bitch.  Old Rudolf Angerlake.  And she's fully aware.  She's fully aware that there's no one behind her.  We should have entered somebody to be slower than her.  Just to watch her cry at the finish line.  That is what we must do next year. 
[00:22:00]  We will, oh, a little musical interlude.  Is this a chariots fire?  Of course it is.  We should get somebody that just paces her and lets her go in front.  You think there'll be a standoff at the finish line?  We can get Steve, make him walk the marathon with a martini in his hand the whole time.  Earl.  And then you can just wait there and go, no, after you.  And make her cross the finish line. 
[00:22:30]  And then our guy can cross and be the last guy.  And then they'll write stories about him.  Right.  And he'll be all over the TV.  And if she refuses to go, is she in a wheelchair?  No.  I was going to say, you can just push her right across the finish line.  Hey, you win.  Honestly, she looks pretty pathetic.  She's got the crutches with the...  Oh, the metal braced crutches?  Yeah, you know.  But she...  I see right through her.  She's all, like, dramatic as she's crossing the line.  She's been doing this every year.  Yeah.  She knows the, you know, the game. 
[00:23:00]  She knows what works for the press.  Of course.  Yeah.  What's her last name again?  Kaplowitz?  Ugh.  This bothers me.  What a pretty name.  Zully Kaplowitz.  Jesus, your leg shouldn't work if that's your name.  Anthony and I have been following her little story for years.  And sure enough, we get in and they're showing her across the line.  I'm like, not her again.  Which means she's doing it on purpose every year.  Hey, what happened to Uta Pippig?  Uta Pippig?  Remember her?  She retired.  Did she retire? 
[00:23:30]  I believe so, yeah.  I remember watching her on the Boston Marathon when we were on the air.  Oh, my God.  She crapped herself and she had her period at the same time.  So she passed us by.  We were broadcasting live.  She passes us by.  We were horrified.  But as she ran by, we were looking and blood and crap were dripping down her legs as she's  like running and all in pain, just surging for that finish line. 
[00:24:00]  Crap and period blood.  Dude, everyone.  We were right on the course, you know, right off on the curb there.  Everyone, as she ran by, was like, oh, my God.  You see that?  It was just dripping down her legs.  You just heard this collective.  Oh.  It was brown and red just flowing down her legs.  Yeah, blood from the front, crap from the back, and down her thighs and her calves all  the way into her sneakers.  Hey, whatever.  Wow.  What else happened on that fine day, Anthony?  That's when Opie punched somebody. 
[00:24:30]  Live on the air.  That's right.  Yeah.  We were in a bar.  One of the many times.  Someone was taunting Opie, and he totally faked him out.  He started yelling, what?  I can't hear you.  No, I'll tell the story.  I don't care.  Well, it's a quickie.  It's a real quickie.  We're at this bar, Marianne's, and we're with all our listeners, you know, hardcore  listeners just drinking with us.  Ant and I are even hammered.  We're just, like, broadcasting live.  It's a mess.  And we're in front of this table, right, with about a thousand of our listeners around  and one ass.  And the one ass starts going, hey, Howard Stern rules. 
[00:25:00]  Howard Stern rules, right?  He's trying to get attention.  And I'm sizing him up already because the table's about four feet wide, so I can't really  reach him.  So I go, what?  This is all live in the air.  I'm like, what?  I can't hear you.  What?  So he starts yelling louder, Howard Stern rules.  Howard Stern rules.  And he leans in a little bit.  I'm sizing him up.  I go, what?  I can't hear you.  Dope walks right into it.  He leans in again.  He goes, I told you.  Bam!  It's clocked him.  The guy totally bit on the I can't hear you thing. 
[00:25:30]  Because Opie's like, what?  What?  And the guy just kept getting closer and closer.  It's like, what?  And Opie leans out and like cups his ear.  Like, what?  Right when the guy leaned a little closer.  And there's audio of Anthony because we were doing a break at the time where Anthony goes,  oh my god, Opie just punched somebody.  So then all hell breaks loose.  This guy had just a fear of death on his eyes because now he's realizing, oh my god,  I'm in front of a thousand people that are fans of these guys.  In the wrong camp.  And I just got punched in the face.  Then the bouncers grab this guy, put him in some kind of like Master Poe type of hold, 
[00:26:00]  and they start dragging him out.  And everyone's drunk.  I mean, these are hardcore Boston people that love to drink.  And everyone starts, you know, punching the guy and pop-shotting the guy on the way out of the place.  And they throw him out.  What a fun day that was.  It was unbelievable.  Everyone all drunk.  We're all just hammered.  At Boston, they love to drink up there.  They love to drink.  Everyone's just cocked.  I'm watching the marathon.  I'm fucking cocked. 
[00:26:30]  They give everyone the day off.  They make it a holiday.  Uh-huh.  Because everything's got to shut down.  It's out of control.  Can't get through anywhere.  It's the best day of the year in Boston, though.  It's a great day.  I think.  It's always so much fun.  All right.  We could either take a break or we could go on to the next subject.  Next victim.  Steve.  Yeah.  We got to get Steve in here.  We kind of touched on this yesterday.  If you don't know by now, the Opie and Anthony show is definitely a soap opera.  There's all sorts of things that are going on all the time.  And we're giving you updates and whatnot.  And yesterday, we kind of touched on the fact that Anthony and I noticed that the promos 
[00:27:00]  for this show are falling into just a couple themes.  A couple?  Yeah.  I see one really strong theme on any of the promos of this show.  What's wrong, Steve?  I hate that Zoe bitch.  Yeah.  What do you think of Zoe?  Who are we talking about?  Zoe was the lady that crossed the finish line last at the New York City Marathon.  Oh, she's the one with the little scribbled up legs. 
[00:27:30]  And Martini Steve is in the studio.  Okay.  I walk into that every goddamn time.  Is that the girl, the wheelchair chick?  Is that it?  No, she has MS and all.  And, you know, I'm already getting attacked on the instant feedback and stuff.  But, see, she knows exactly what she's doing, okay?  You know, she needs to be last every year to get the attention.  Yeah.  Publicity stunt.  It's not the first year she's done it.  She knows she's milking it, right? 
[00:28:00]  It's like driving naked girls on a bus down Broadway.  Well, we don't do it every year.  Having sex in a church.  Well, we don't do it every year.  Publicity stunt.  We don't do it every year.  No.  So, yesterday, we were talking about the – Steve's shaking his head because he knows it's  coming.  We were talking about –  Steve, if you would step up into that barrel there.  Thanks.  Gee, it's in my turn already.  We noticed a theme.  You know, there's promos that help the show when we go to break and coming out of break. 
[00:28:30]  And we started noticing very nervously that you're doing a lot of women-hating promos.  There are – I mean, it's rampant.  On this show, the women-abusing, women-hating promos that are put together for breaks when  we go in and out of break.  And we believe Steve is responsible for these.  I'm responsible for letting them through.  I can't take credit for actually producing all of them. 
[00:29:00]  I can't because – and I don't want to –  But the buck stops here.  Right.  But in terms of actually putting them in a system, yeah, I did.  Yeah, but, you know, I think you're getting a lot of production pieces and you decide  which ones will work for the show.  And you've decided that anything that makes fun or beats up a woman is a good promo for  the O.P. Anthony show.  Well, it's not necessarily that.  It's just –  We're going to start going out on the road again and doing, you know, promotions.  And I really want to see some women at these things.  Yeah.  And we're getting email like, dude, you know, I'm a female.  I would love to listen to you guys. 
[00:29:30]  I'm afraid.  But it gets a little harsh with these promos.  And then so Anthony and I are like, you know what, maybe we should get all the promos and  see if there's a point here.  It's like punch sound, women scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Well, there's three categories of promos.  Oh.  There's only three categories.  Only three.  Yeah.  Only three subjects are covered in all of our promos.  We got the overly gay promos where Anthony and I are getting banged in the bungholes  or titty-effed by a man.  Thank you.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Then there's just the all-out violent promos like the angry golfer and all that you've heard  and the girl getting her vagina blown up, which also could be in the female category.  Yeah, that could be in the female category.  Yeah, of course.  The anti-golfer one?  So there's four gay promos that help sell the show.  There's four violent promos, just violent people in general.  And then there's 12 promos about women getting abused.  12 abused women promos. 
[00:30:30]  Wow, I didn't realize there was that many.  So we just want to go through a few of these.  Uh-huh.  Here's the first one.  Chevy gals need love, too.  That's quite possibly the filthiest vagina I have ever seen.  All right, a little degrading.  A little women degradation is good.  There we go.  Why can't we have a promo about a nice, young, fresh vagina?  Oh, I can use that audio right there.  All right, very good.  All right, that'll be a promo.  Good.  And here's the next one, Anthony. 
[00:31:00]  Evil.  And loving it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, an ugly chick promo.  Well, not really abusing, but it's just a little covertly.  No, this is just the female category.  So, so far, we got a girl with a filthy vagina.  Yeah.  And obviously a fat, ugly pig.  At the bar.  That we're going to F when we drink enough.  Drunk girls walking into traffic is funny. 
[00:31:30]  Wandered into traffic and bounced off the hood of a fucking bus.  I can see my house from here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  That's a woman.  I think that's funny.  Getting drunk and hit by a bus.  Yeah.  And you're not acting at all.  How you say fucking in that promo, you're just enjoying yourself a little bit.  I was so giddy when I was doing that stuff.  I was so sleep-deprived and punchy.  I had no idea what came out until those sweepers came back. 
[00:32:00]  Where's the promos about us celebrating the female?  Well, celebrating the female.  I don't think there are any.  I know.  You hear him celebrating the female.  Why would you want to do that?  No, it's not so much that.  You know what?  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  That's right.  What's that?  What's that?  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  That's right.  And Steve knows.  That's right.  Okay, go on.  Here's the next one.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Fat Girls.  Please let me meet you.  I am huge debt. 
[00:32:30]  Just love you.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, Fat Girl.  Another Fat Girl promo.  Promo.  Fat Girl.  All right.  Here's another one.  The Fat Girls.  Do you have an Audi belly button?  You ever eat an entire chocolate cake?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A little more degrading of fat women?  Ever eat a chocolate, a whole chocolate cake?  What was that?  Yeah, I don't know.  I just, that was the instruction I got from the guy who created those was just ramble into 
[00:33:00]  a microphone for 10 minutes.  And I'll piece together whatever you say.  So he took snippets of whatever I said going on 10 minutes, processed the vocals, and said  it back.  And it was 10 minutes of you just talking about fat girls?  No, it was, I was actually, I was rambling.  The dry, it was.  Drunk girls that are so desperate that they're just waiting around for you to get drunk enough?  That's right.  Jesus.  How about a little variety?  Um, all right.  Well, you know what?  In all fairness, picking through Opie and Anthony Show vocals for drop-ins, those little pieces 
[00:33:30]  of audio, you come across a lot of really violent lines.  And it's very difficult to pick out one for you guys.  And it's so exciting for you to just make sure you isolate those violent, let me incorporate  this into some woman thing.  Is there such an abundance of them?  It's like, oh, hey, look, another one.  All right, fine.  Throw that in there.  Well, how about this one?  Ah!  Shut your mouth!  I said shut your fucking mouth! 
[00:34:00]  I masturbated so hard, I almost broke my vagina.  Bump.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That's one of my personal favorites from Steve.  Shut your fucking mouth!  What were you trying to get at with that promo?  Yeah, I didn't do that one, but I did think that was funny.  But you really enjoyed it.  Yeah, I did.  The woman pretty much tied up in a basement somewhere getting her...  Yeah, that's from that Rob Zombie movie.  Getting an attitude adjustment.  Getting beaten.  Mm-hmm.  All right, well, maybe we're just looking into this a little too much, huh? 
[00:34:30]  You think?  It's date night.  Get your shovel.  I never really find a good sound effect of a guy getting hit in the head with a shovel.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Date night, get the shovel.  So, I guess that means you're going on a date, there might be some date rape involved, and  then you gotta get rid of the girl?  No, that was, um, uh, I think that was one of Norton's lines originally, like from the 
[00:35:00]  old show.  He would talk about hitting girls with shovels, and so I just incorporated that into a sweeper.  I don't want to take credit from that.  No, actually, when I do it, it's a gardening reference.  Ah, I see.  But the point is, this is all the female promos we found, and not one is, uh, flattering to  the...  No!  To the female.  No, there's not one flattering female promo.  Well, maybe this one is, Anthony.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, for crying out loud.  Yeah, heard you the first time. 
[00:35:30]  Can I help you?  Yeah, that's me.  Yeah?  What do you mean, served?  Divorce?  That bitch!  All right.  I have a question, is, why was, why was the teacher from the Peanuts giving you a subpoena?  Oh, that was...  Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop.  Yeah, exactly.  You try to find random speech of, uh, people.  Exactly.  Well, I couldn't find the...  I'm just trying to find one that would be flattering to the female.  Flattering, where a girl listening to the show would go, wow, that's really nice. 
[00:36:00]  They're very thoughtful.  I like those guys.  They're thinking about us a little bit.  You know, I think I'll go out and, uh, meet them next time they're in my town.  The only way you're getting a date is with a bottle of chloroform.  It's the OPN enemy show.  Right?  Well, now you're beating and chloroform.  That was what I tried to do back at the old station, but the old PD would never let me get that one through.  Why both?  Why a beating and chloroform? 
[00:36:30]  You don't need to punch her if you knock her out.  I think she struggled, like you were trying to get the chloroform on her and she started struggling.  There you go.  So you gotta beat the crap out of her a little bit and then put the chloroform back on.  Okay.  You seem a little angry, Steve.  Yeah, I've got some unresolved anger issues, but I'm working them through.  And this is a way to resolve them?  Yeah.  And it comes out in his work.  Exactly.  I know a lot of artists are like that, Opie.  I just want to find one.  Famous painters, they do the same thing.  They take it in motion and put it on canvas. 
[00:37:00]  This is a work of art, but another female getting abused that Steve put together.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony show.  No.  Oh, God.  She spilled my chips.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, my God.  No, that's my fault.  I'll bring you a little.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:37:30]  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  Now, I'm not going to deny that that's not funny.  It's hilarious.  He had taken my lines out of context.  Exactly.  He took mine out of context.  That's half the fun of doing these things is I can take the audio and rearrange it in  a totally different way.  And abuse women through my promos.  Well, crap.  Look at the circumstances under which that audio came through.  Another woman getting abused.  This dick was out in the hallway, bawling her eyes out.  Dude, the point is I can't find one where a girl's not getting abused. 
[00:38:00]  Well, in that list, probably not.  You're even going to make fun of your mom.  That seems like you're beating up your mom in that promo. 
[00:38:30]  I was beating up the phone because she wouldn't stop calling.  That was inspired by real events.  She called like four times in a row one day, and I just couldn't get it.  And she'll never do that again.  No.  She leaves me alone now between certain hours.  He's looking like Private Pyle.  He's making these promos, and we're a little nervous around here.  And, you know, I asked the guys to get this together for me.  They're all like, don't even tell them which guy put this together.  Ben just rats him out with a food mouth.  Leonard talks to his soundboard. 
[00:39:00]  Like, Eric had to give this to me on the street this morning, 57th Street.  I was getting out of the cab.  He's like, here, this is what you wanted today.  He's going to kill me.  It's like, put this in your bag now.  I don't want any responsibility.  Maybe this one is a nice one for the women out there, ladies.  Go, poogie, let's burn this motherfucker down!  Here we go, now.  Would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  No, I'm not going to.  Damn it!  Kill yourself. 
[00:39:30]  Right?  Oops.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I thought that was clever.  That's nice.  It's not that they're not clever.  It's all about variety when you do a show like this.  You know, nobody runs sweepers with an actual shotgun body fall dial tone.  What about just a promo about just a hot piece of ass?  Just some...  Just celebrate the female form for us.  Something.  No?  He's shaking his head.  No.  I can do it.  You know what?  Can't be done.  No.  That's not true at all.  That's not true at all. 
[00:40:00]  It's actually painfully easy to do those.  Instead of this.  Did you just put a firecracker in my vagina?  Oh, no.  I just wanted to see what would happen.  No.  No.  Get it out.  Come on.  What's the big deal?  It'll be fun.  Are you fucking crazy?  What are you doing with that later?  I'm coming closer.  If you blow up my pussy, I'm going to bludgeon you.  Oh, stop.  Relax.  I'm just screwing around. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What the freak?  I didn't do that one, but...  Also inspired by True Events.  No.  No.  You know who did that?  Our friend in Philly did that.  Based on a true story.  Our friend in Philly did that with absolutely no direction from anybody.  I told them...  No.  Everybody that's asked if they could do production, I said, go nuts.  I don't want to tell you what you can do.  Just go nuts.  But there was no suggestion made like, hey, you know, if you want to... 
[00:41:00]  Say, guys, let's celebrate the female form.  No.  Well, you know what I mean.  You're shit.  You're making us look like we hate women.  That's the problem.  No.  Well, that's not...  Because here it is.  You got the hate women promos.  Uh-huh.  Hating women promos.  And then this kind of throws it over the top.  Then you got a whole section of gay promos.  So it's like, we hate women.  Here's what we really feel.  O.B. and Anthony.  Yeah.  I fucked them.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  There's no in-between. 
[00:41:30]  We hate women and we butt-sex each other.  And that's now going to end up in a promo.  Thank you.  What you just said.  I know.  Thank you.  You say it.  I farm it out and re-put it back.  O.B. and Anthony.  I bought their asses for a half a pack of cools.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's like prison sex stuff going on.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's a good one, too.  O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:00]  There's like prison sex stuff going on.  Yeah.  Like, I want something in between, I think.  That's right, boy.  Sit down when you please.  Why are you doing this?  You'll be an Anthony Show.  Oh, man.  You got problems, dude.  You really got problems.  I didn't do any of those.  But it was...  How about we just avoid the whole sex thing and come up with something else?  Sure, we can do that.  Like, more of, like, Jim Norton's sayings or some of Anthony's voices. 
[00:42:30]  I love that.  Or...  Instead of this.  O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, boy.  You ever titty-fucked a man?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Jesus, Steve.  Oh.  These are the only categories we got.  Gay.  No, we got the...  Female abuse.  And just overall violence.  No, we got...  Well, in all fairness, we have those long-form pieces.  Those really theatrical ones.  We got the Wow Sweepers, which are all boob references.  Yeah, somebody's commenting, Patrick, saying, hey, what about those hilarious Wow responsibility 
[00:43:00]  promos?  Maybe you can incorporate breast cancer in the new ones.  We did, actually.  Sean from Dallas is saying Steve is getting scarier and scarier.  Seriously, boys, he needs the Zoloft thing.  Yeah, well, Steve's not sleeping.  He's now shaving his head.  Yeah.  The promos are getting more and more violent.  We're getting a little nervous around here.  And all kidding aside, Steve could take any one of us in this room, no problem.  Oh, yeah.  It's not...  It wouldn't even be a contest.  I only take Zoloft to keep from killing y'all. 
[00:43:30]  Welcome to the O.B. and K.S.  Sigh, you son of a bitch!  I like that.  That was me getting killed.  It's one of the violent ones.  A little gunfire and then a death rattle.  Jesus.  That is one of my favorites, actually, but it's just so twisted.  You can never really find a good sound effect of a guy getting hit in the head with a shovel. 
[00:44:00]  Good evening, sir.  May I interest you in our soup de jour?  Shut the fuck up, you goddamn fuckhole, you piece of shit!  I'm seeing a theme.  This is all I can find.  This is it.  They all, even...  It doesn't matter what category, every single one of these has this element of violence to it.  Every one of them has just this violent background to it. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  It's cathartic, really.  So do you like women or do you hate them?  I love women.  I'm married to a woman.  She's great.  But she, you know, pisses me off sometimes.  Oh, shit.  She probably heard that, too.  Uh-oh.  Now what?  Thank God I left my cell phone at home.  You should take a tape recorder home and make some more promos.  Yeah.  I can only imagine what that sounds like. 
[00:45:00]  Nothing, nothing really.  So do you see where we're getting at?  Sure.  Oh, you're going to have the most freshest, cleanest...  No, it's not about that, because a lot of these are really, really funny.  It's just, it's all about variety.  We're not seeing the variety.  Oh, there's going to be some variety.  Like, this one's hilarious.  Now that video clip is even better than the promo. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, is that video clip on Foundry Music?  Yeah, it is.  At opianethony.com?  Mm-hmm.  Some black guy grabs a golf club after rambling some crackhead speech right into a camera.  He grabs a golf club and walks up to a car that's in a parking lot with someone in it  and just starts beating the crap out of the car.  And the person in the car is horrified, trying to get away, and he's just like, 
[00:46:00]  What are you up, nigga?  What are you going to do, nigga?  What are you going to...  Just beating the crap out of this car.  For no reason, right?  No, for no reason.  Well, I think he was trying to prove that that corner was his,  and he wasn't going to let anybody show him that they could go on his turf.  Yeah.  So that made it into a promo.  Exactly.  Again, a little bit of violence.  Yeah.  Well, I've actually got a guy who has been emailing me video clips that are winding up  on the website, and he's been going around the projects in Newark and collecting audio  off of homeless people.  Like, he's giving them a couple bucks in there. 
[00:46:30]  Oh.  Wiggling their boobs in front of them for a while.  And some of that audio might make it in.  And that's not violent at all.  All right.  Well, keep it up, Steve, because no one's going to tell you no.  No.  I know.  You do whatever you want.  That's right.  Thank you.  He's like the kid from the Twilight Zone movie.  Anthony, good promo, Anthony.  That's a very good promo that you did.  Right.  He's going to send you to the cornfield if you make fun of his promos.  Right.  I love the anti-woman promos, Anthony. 
[00:47:00]  That's a wonderful promo.  Yes, you did a good job on that promo.  All right.  It's a very good promo.  Yes, it is, Anthony.  That promo you done, it was really good.  Really good.  But could you send it to the cornfield?  Could you please send it to the cornfield?  I'm going to have to go through the audio of this show with a fine-tooth comb and take  out some of the choice.  Why don't you just go through it with a shovel? 
[00:47:30]  That, too.  Take that fine-tooth comb and ram it in a twat.  I didn't say that.  I did.  I know you did.  I love it.  A couple people want in here.  Oh.  Some others have noticed?  Oh, everyone noticed.  That's why we had to bring it up today.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Michigan.  Hey, Jeff.  What's up?  Hey, that's the son of a faggot, all that flame wear he wears, and that's a beard at  home.  He wants to hang out in truck stops.  You fucking fag, Steve.  Oh, my God.  Don't do this today.  You fag. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you bend over and blow him, too, while you're in there?  Jesus Christ.  Don't do this to Steve, man.  Oh, boy.  It's all right.  Oh, what's he going to do?  Take his purse and go cry in the patrol room?  Oh, my God.  Don't do this.  Fucking fag.  Put another flame shirt on.  Here, let me stop at the truck stop.  Buy you a flame hat.  Thank you.  Just make sure it doesn't have the Velcro in the back.  I don't like those Velcro ones.  Steve, I really don't know what that guy's saying.  Oh, I do.  I apologize, okay? 
[00:48:30]  Maybe he'll die in a promo.  Blame.  I really apologize.  I have no idea what that guy's getting at.  Let's see what David the trucker wants to say.  Hey, David.  Hey, man.  Between yesterday and today, I had a strong suspicion yesterday, but Steve's a fucking fag.  Oh, no.  I mean, Jesus Christ, man.  If he ain't women that bad, Steve's fucking, man.  Come on.  Hey, man.  You're going to send him out to the truck driver.  He's going to be out at the pickle park. 
[00:49:00]  I'm going to be in and give him blowjobs with truck drivers.  Now, we know Steve is not, as you say, a fag.  At least we wouldn't say it to his face.  This is so uncomfortable.  Steve, I apologize.  I don't know why the listeners would say this to you.  Of course not.  Lori, the trucker.  Lori.  I'm here.  Hey, what's going on?  Well, I just wanted to chime in about this woman batch, and I actually left you guys a message on the FU line. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know who y'all were from Adam.  I signed up just because it sounded like something different on XM.  Yes.  And at first, you know, I thought, I might not like these guys because I hate Howard Stern.  Right.  Because you can tell that Howard hates women.  Right.  Underneath everything he does, he hates women.  But I felt something different from you guys, a different vibe. 
[00:50:00]  Like, okay, you know, you make fun of us, and that's cool.  But these guys really dig women.  They like women.  Uh-huh.  And then, all of a sudden, it just, like, changed.  I mean, the whole vibe here so started changing.  Yeah.  And I swear to God, I've been considering dropping you because, I guess for me, the final straw, and you can't blame it all on Steve.  Like, I thought you were easy on Donkey Sausage.  You should have given it to her with both barrels.  But when the couch chick came in, and you all got her to admit that she was in not a very good state of mind, and then you messed with her that way. 
[00:50:30]  Well, I didn't like that at all.  I certainly did not enjoy that one bit.  So, you know, everything started getting so anti-woman, and then you bash on this chick that's doing just a favor for you.  I'll kiss my ass.  What was that? 
[00:51:00]  Trying to cover it up with some kind of noise.  Well, that's real mature, boys.  All right, Laurie.  Thank you.  You're lucky we let you talk.  Steve wants to punch you in the face.  Chuck both your holes and get back to work.  All right, Steve.  Okay.  Keep up the good work.  She's considering dropping us.  I got some good ones coming up.  Yeah?  See what you're doing, Steve?  No, non-violent, actually.  Non-violent.  I got some...  Oh, what's the theme?  I got...  Bestiality?  No.  No?  No, actually...  Well, you'll see.  I just...  I don't know if it's going to come together yet, because I've got to farm out more audio,  but it's hard to find audio of you guys being really nice, and that's... 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, that's true.  It is.  It is disgustingly difficult, and especially given the setup we have now, it's not easy to find those choice  little moments.  Aren't we complimenting girls during maybe, guess what's in my pants, let's say?  I think it's like, ooh, that sounds nice.  You know, you're kind of...  There should be some complimentary lines in there.  You know what?  That might actually work.  That might actually work.  Well, we got a guy from Nebraska.  He wants to compliment you.  We'll end with this one.  John, go ahead. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I just want to say that you guys are rocking.  All right.  Yep.  You there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve, you guys' promos are rocking.  You guys are doing great.  Give up the good work.  All right.  See, there's a guy that enjoys your promos.  That's Scott Peterson calling in before his sentencing.  Now you can skip out of the studio all happy.  It's a guy from Silence of the Lambs.  Your promos sound really good.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Was she a great big fan person?  Yeah.  Size 14, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  Puts the sound effect in the promo.  Oh, this whole break is not...  You know, see, I can't farm this whole break for audio now.  Because if I do, I'd make a promo.  How about something nice about the chick who blew the 8-year-old black kid?  I'd like to hear something about her.  God bless her.  Excellent work she's doing.  Yeah, why don't we get into that story next, okay?  Yeah.  And we also have McGreevy, his audio from his farewell speech.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:53:00]  How about something from...  The lovely governor of New Jersey that came out of the closet,  and now he's stepping down,  and he did his farewell speech on TV last night.  This is Governor McGreevy's favorite show with some of those promos.  I've got my work cut out for me.  Sure do.  We'll continue in a few minutes here,  but first, it's Fag Talk.  Oh.  This program is funded by the Andy Schatz Foundation.  Hello, welcome to Fag Talk,  the show where we talk about fags,  or as they call them in America, cigarettes.  Let's not waste any more time. 
[00:53:30]  Let's bring out Bob the Fag Expert.  Bob, welcome.  Thank you very much.  Wonderful to be here.  Tell us how we can be more intimate with our fags.  Right.  Well, when you have a possession that you love or cherish,  you do what?  Uh, you give it a name.  Exactly.  So why not name your fag?  That's a wonderful idea.  It is a wonderful idea,  and go ahead and do that.  Okay, right.  Now, I've got right...  You gave me your fag before the show.  This is wonderful here.  Right.  I love this one, too,  because it's one of my favorite fags.  Right.  Ah, from France.  Look at that beauty.  It's a beautiful fag. 
[00:54:00]  I'm going to call him Dick.  All right.  Mm.  Oh, I love sucking on this dick.  It's wonderful.  My fag, I call it Woody.  Woody.  Let me help you out there.  Thank you.  How's your Woody?  My Woody is wonderful.  Would you like to try my Woody?  I'll tell you what I will do.  You suck my dick,  and I'll suck your Woody.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Hello, Dick.  Oh, that's a wonderful, wonderful suck.  Thank you so much for being here, Bob.  Thank you.  Meantime, I'm going to enjoy my Woody. 
[00:54:30]  You enjoy my dick.  Right.  Join us again next time,  right here on Factbook.  Bye-bye.  It's a wonderful day.  It's a wonderful day.  It's time to find America.  Let's hear it for California.  California.  This guy's a champ, man. 
[00:55:00]  Lucky girl.  I need a towel.  Yeah.  I need a towel.  Come on.  They're applauding for the other booth, too.  Thumbs up.  Stop.  Jesus Christ.  Think you can do better?

[00:58:30]  I thought I smelled her.  All right, bye.  Last time I was in Houston, somebody broke into my truck and stole my radio.  Thank you, whoever you were.  I got to drive back home listening to the sound of wind for five and a half hours.  I went to the insurance company.  I was filling out these forms, and I got to the part on the form where I said, what kind  of radio was it?  And I told the guy I didn't remember.  He said, Mr. White, if you can remember what kind of radio it was, we'll know how much money 
[00:59:00]  to give you.  That's some good news, right?  I thought of a real expensive sounding brand, and I wrote it down.  He knew I was lying.  Mr. White, I don't believe Rolex makes a radio.  It was a clock radio. 
[00:59:30]  Write the check, premium boy.  O.B., Anthony, Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Hello, hello.  Hello.  Not a place called vertical.  It's everything I wish I didn't know. 
[01:00:00]  So do.  Give me something.  I can feel.  Feel.  Feel.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  U2 Vertigo.  I'm enjoying my copy of the brand new U2 CD.  I love it.  Freshly burned.  You got to check out track four, man, real fast.  Track four.  What are you doing, Ben?  Jesus.  Ben came running over. 
[01:00:30]  I know.  Throw a set of balls, man.  He ran over so fast, his hair actually became neat.  Ben is just in a panic.  That's a good producer.  Not over those two CDs that you have.  What?  We got the brand new Eminem CD and we got the brand new U2 CD.  And by the way, for anyone else here, you can get them so easily on the internet.  There's no problem finding it.  Oh.  I have so many friends.  I have so many friends that have it.  This is the hottest thing in New York.  Everyone has their copy of U2.  Already has it.  Usually when you get an advanced copy, you're like the king of your block, man. 
[01:01:00]  Like, hey, dude, look what I got.  You want me to burn you a copy?  Everyone has it.  They're all walking around with it.  It's already in their iPods as they walk the streets of New York.  And the CD is unbelievable.  There are so many cool tracks off this new U2 album.  Why don't you play one?  All right.  Track five?  Yeah.  Put it on track four.  I hear it's a good one.  Ben.  Ben, grab the CD.  Oh, Steve, too.  Nuh-uh.  Why?  No, because Ben and I are screwed if that hits the air.  Dude, we're fully aware of that.  We're at the point in our lives and careers, Opie, where if we threw off, we'll pull out 
[01:01:30]  the hoses, we'll hose down the studio, and we'll move on to the next people.  It's all right.  Steve will just tackle you.  Steve will just tackle you.  You see how fast he can run in there?  Maybe you can have a girl getting kicked and yell, Sunday, bloody Sunday.  Yeah, they would get fired.  Nothing?  They would get fired.  All right.  Yeah, they would get fired for what we do.  And believe it or not, we do like these guys.  So, all right.  Someone wants to know if Steve wants to play Hokey Pokey in the Butt. 
[01:02:00]  Hokey Pokey in the Butt?  I don't even have that anymore.  Or do I?  Where did that go?  What happened with that?  The Gay Zone?  The Da Da Dave?  Oh, really?  I might have it on here.  Oh, there you go.  It is relevant, and then we can move on to the whole Blue Sky thing that we were trying  to figure out yesterday.  Blue Sky.  Is this...  Here, Ben, look on this.  Ben's busy trying to book guests for our show.  I love that.  I've read all the emails from corporate.  I've seen everything.  I just don't comment. 
[01:02:30]  You know what I do with email?  I email the staff of this program only.  I don't email corporate.  And it's just like, hey, did you see this story in the news?  Perhaps we should print it out for tomorrow.  I see emails that are CC'd with like 20 people.  And it's all of us from the show.  It's management.  It's sub-management.  It's all these corporate people.  And the last one I saw was a couple of days back, and it was about guests.  Right.  It was about booking guests. 
[01:03:00]  High-powered, Opie.  High-caliber guests they want on this program.  Well, the people down there in Washington, yeah, they feel like we should have bigger guests  on this show.  Bigger guests.  They're not feeling the Rich Vosses and the Carlos Mencias.  No, no.  These guys are all really good friends of ours and do really good radio.  That's the point.  But I guess...  The Pablos.  We do know a collection of asses.  We certainly do.  But they do good radio.  But I guess it's all about having that big guest on the show.  And they'll sit there and say nothing. 
[01:03:30]  But you can tell everyone, hey, we had George Clooney on the show.  Now, yeah.  It's not there?  Okay.  Ben is now trying some of these contacts to see if we can get certain guests on the show.  Because it's Ben's ass on the line.  It's been hinted, look, if Ben doesn't get the bigger guests, you know, he's going to  go bye-bye.  But let me tell you something.  It ain't Ben's fault.  I understand.  This program is not inviting to people of that caliber, of that type of Hollywood guest  does not really want to sit here and discuss punching women in the face promos to sell 
[01:04:00]  their god-awful Hollywood drivel movies.  Right.  But Ben is trying.  Ben's trying to get Brad Pitt.  Yeah.  Ben's trying.  Like, you wouldn't believe.  He called me at lunch yesterday going, all right.  And he's laughing and giggling the whole time because he knows how stupid this is.  Of course he is.  But he's doing what he's told from the people in Washington.  So who are you trying to get on this show, Ben?  Dude, dude.  I'm on the phone.  I'm on the other line right now with Johnny Depp's people. 
[01:04:30]  I'm going to get Johnny Depp on the show.  That was the funny one.  Johnny Depp and his people don't even know what XM satellite radio is.  Of course they don't.  Look.  Ben's trying, man.  He's trying.  It's a fledgling industry.  Right.  We know that.  The people that are subscribed to XM, the people that work at XM, the people that are involved  in some way, shape, or form with satellite radio, they understand what it is.  They see the potential in this.  Yeah.  It's going to be huge.  It's going to take time, though. 
[01:05:00]  But the reality of it is there are still a lot of people that have yet to find out what's  going on with satellite radio.  They will.  Just like cable TV, they will.  But where we are right now, it's very hard to call up George fucking Clooney and convince  him that it's advantageous for him to come on this program to sell his movie.  It's basically asking George Clooney if he wants to do an interview with a college radio  station.  Do you want to hang out with us? 
[01:05:30]  Right.  That's pretty much what it is.  Hi, George.  Hey, George Clooney.  Hi.  It's Opie, Anthony, and a few of our friends.  And we'd like to know if you want to come down and hang out with us.  Maybe have a beer or something.  You want to have a beer?  We'll hang out.  You're not that busy, right?  Oh, we'll be talking to a lot of people, relatively speaking.  If you would hang out with my neighbor down the street, there would be far less people  you'd be talking to.  But, yeah, you want to come out?  XM satellite radio.  What?  Satellite. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  It's up there in space.  No, XM.  Yeah, like FM, only with an X in front, and the F is gone.  No, you don't have to put a space suit on.  No.  No, it's on Earth.  It's on Earth.  Right.  It's on Earth.  Yeah.  We just want you to come down, and we can talk about Ocean's 12 that's coming out, and  you know, all that.  What?  No.  No, it's not CB.  It's XM satellite radio.  No, you won't have to key down the mic when you talk. 
[01:06:30]  No, it's not accurate about that little bit you just did.  Why?  You would never have George Clooney on the phone.  Right.  How did I get George Clooney on my fake phone?  You would have George Clooney's people's people.  I took it way out of, oh, I was talking to George.  A little out of control there, you know, thinking you're that big that you would actually get  him on the phone.  I actually almost had him, I thought.  I thought he was coming in.  So, Ben, who are we working to get on the show in the near future?  Who are we working on?  Watch Ben start giggling.  Oh, we better not say it.  Someone might block us.  No one's blocking us, because we have four times the influence other people do. 
[01:07:00]  Exactly.  All right.  Who are we working on, Ben?  You really want to know some of the ones on the phone?  I bet we do absolutely want to know.  These are actual phone calls that Ben has made just to try to save his job.  George Clooney.  Yeah, we know.  That's a possibility.  Brad Pitt.  Johnny Depp.  Yeah.  Easy?  Yeah, those were, yeah.  What did the...  Colin Farrell.  What did Johnny Depp's people really say?  Yeah, they just, they didn't, they were like, whatever.  Whatever.  That's great.  Well, we have a definite whatever of Johnny Depp's people. 
[01:07:30]  I'm sure that's exactly what they say to Good Morning America, too.  Ah, whatever.  Didn't you tell me about the, the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the little  MiFi Walkman?  Yeah.  That's a great invention, by the way.  I know it is.  Hey, uh, Ben.  Yes.  You know, we're clearing out the cubicles and stuff.  Uh, you two can set up right in that room.  Well, you know, I was thinking that, you know.  I think we should call up Bono.  Yeah.  And see if we can't get him, uh, get him down here.  Uh, hello.  Well, what the fuck is XM? 
[01:08:00]  Will you have some fucking Guinness?  Okay, right there.  So there's some, there's actually some other ones.  There's actually some other ones I don't want to mention.  Ooh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Secrets.  We, we might have a shot at someone that actually has name recognition.  Dude, we can't even get Louis Black anymore.  Yeah, Louis Black is even blowing us off.  Louis Black is blowing us off.  How are we going to get anybody?  If anyone holds Ben responsible for not getting guests for this show, I will personally put  them in a bucket and ship them out because it's not anyone's fault. 
[01:08:30]  It's just the, people don't want to come on this show right now.  Not yet.  I mean, it's a slow build, people.  It's a very slow build.  We understood what we were getting into, but we believe in this technology.  We believe this is the future radio, but it's going to take some time.  Our biggest interview so far has been John McEnroe.  That's not too bad.  It's because we were going to be on his show that night.  Oh, yeah.  That's not bad.  We talked about Tatum O'Neal.  We also had Ozzy on.  Right, right.  On the phone.  I'm talking about coming in. 
[01:09:00]  McEnroe didn't come in here.  Oh, that's right.  But Louis Black will come on, though.  You guys, I read the email.  The biggest guest has been Pablo.  In spring, in the spring, when there's a book to promote, they said that he will be coming on.  And we had Kevin Smith on the phone, too.  We found, we're finding out who our.  Yeah, in the spring, Louis is, you know something?  We're finding out who our real friends are.  You know, a lot of people blew us off after our demise.  I'm a little pissed off at Louis.  I never wanted to be pissed at Louis.  I like the man.  He's very funny.  And now we're getting the blow-off from Louis Black. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, he says.  Those Daily Show people are a bunch of assholes.  I love the show, but they have gotten so, like, self-important.  In Comedy Central, slow down.  In the early days of AEW, Jon Stewart was on the show all the time.  Yeah, we had Jon Stewart on the show.  Yeah, now he won't come on the show.  No way!  And it's harder now than it was at AEW.  That's all right.  All right, well, so we're working on big guests for the. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, Mario Cantone lined up.  The new Opie and Anthony show.  Now we got Britney, Eminem, and U2.  We'll have them all playing out here on top of the table.  All at the same time.  It'll be great.  And then Steve can come in and punch Britney in the vagina.  Never say no, but there's a reality to this whole thing.  Yeah, famous people want nothing to do with us.  Right!  Stop hiding us on the premium tier, and then maybe we can get even bigger guests.  We're not like Hollywood Howie, where you can have these guests on.  And to tell you the truth, I don't necessarily want them on. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, we never really wanted the high-profile guests on our show.  This show isn't about getting, what are we, are you going to sit Johnny Depp down there,  too cool for the room, and start talking to him?  I'd like to.  Just smell his finger.  Get a picture?  For a while, but get a picture, of course.  It's about the funny on this show.  Yeah.  A lot of people feel like you're not doing a really good radio show unless you have  that A-list celebrity sitting there saying nothing.  You know what it's like?  And the bigger the celebrity, you know, a little inside to this whole thing,  like we had Carmen Electra on a few times.  What a bitch.  We had a bunch of almost A-list celebrities, we'll call them, 
[01:11:00]  but Carmen Electra, when she was on our show, she was definitely happening, okay?  This is what happens.  They sit down, and then a whole entourage of people come in, their publicist.  The publicist, which is the scum of the earth, the publicist, will sit there and look at you  like you're a piece of shit and question everything you're asking their client with those faces.  They make the face, and they'll shake their head like, no, no.  And they're constantly looking at their watch and doing the cut-off sign with their finger on the neck. 
[01:11:30]  They give you the wrap-it-up sign.  The pointing at their watch, you want to lean over and smack them.  And you ask them a question that's a little off-kilter,  something that they're not asked every friggin' time they do an interview,  and the publicist looks at you, shakes their head no, and puts that scowl on their face.  Oh, no, even worse.  You want to reach over and choke the bitch.  No, even worse, they'll pull their client out of the studio,  or they'll cover up the microphone, or they'll say stuff like, don't answer that.  Yeah.  Crocodile Hunters, remember his publicist hung up on the call because she didn't like the questions? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, that's right.  Remember that?  Yeah, and the publicists, when you do the phone call interviews, they listen on another line.  Of course.  They got the hookup, and if they decide it's going to a place that they don't like,  yeah, they'll just hang up on the interview.  Yeah, and it's no fun to be involved with that.  I don't like those guests.  We don't really care.  I mean, if it happens, it happens.  But, I mean, they can't be obsessed with us talking to the really, really famous people on our show.  People want to come in and hang out.  It's usually very boring radio.  Yeah, if they want to come in and hang out and be part of the show, that's fine. 
[01:12:30]  But to sit there and try to do an interview and ask them the same questions they've been asked a thousand times, it sucks.  Well, I think that we could ask them original questions.  Like, I'd love to get Ozzy in the studio because I want to ask him, like, what made you want to get into music?  Yeah, that's a good question.  I'm sure he's never been asked before.  Like, what are you going to ask?  All right, well.  Enough.  So, then we took another meeting after the show yesterday, and we were thinking about doing some kind of O&A, like, Christmas party, like our first live broadcast. 
[01:13:00]  Well, no, I think we're going to have a few live broadcasts before this, right?  Are we broadcasting the night before Thanksgiving from the downtown on Long Island?  Yeah.  When your brother does his tribute band thing, and you're going to be singing, and it's just going to be a lot of fun out there at the downtown.  It's going to be a nice drunken night out.  All right.  Well, we're thinking of doing some kind of, like, twisted or demented Christmas-type show.  It could be fun if we could develop this thing.  Christmas party-type thing.  So, we were discussing it with the salespeople and the programming guy down here in Washington. 
[01:13:30]  Which I've got to tell you, you know, nothing personal, guys, in Washington, but the after-the-show meetings, oof.  When we're sitting here, especially a phoner, it's Opie sitting where he sits for the whole show, me sitting where I sit for the whole show,  exhausted because, you know, we just did the show, and we wake up kind of early and never sleep well.  And then on the cell phone with a conference of, what, three, four, five people down in D.C.?  You know how hard it is to stay awake during those?  Yeah.  It's not a, you know, it's not like George Clooney's on that other line when I'm chatting with him. 
[01:14:00]  You know what keeps us awake, though?  All the corporate lingo.  Oh, it's hilarious.  We've already, you know, goofed on the bucket analogy.  Yeah, we got this idea.  Let me tee it up for you.  Yeah, teeing it up.  Let me tee it up for you, I tell you.  Tee this up for you.  It's like you're teeing it up.  And then we'll slam it.  And the other one is we'll circle back around on that, whatever that means.  I don't know what that means either.  We're going to circle back around, which means nothing gets done.  It just keeps going in circles and circles and circles. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, run it through the mill one more time.  We're going to circle around before we decide on that.  Well, yesterday we're talking about this possible, like, demanding Christmas show or something.  It's very primitive right now.  We've got to try to figure something out.  And all of a sudden, was it Kevin?  I'm not sure who said it.  Oh, one of the guys goes, well, before we blue sky that, yeah, we're going to talk about it.  You know, we'll run it around a few times before we blue sky it.  Blue sky it.  What the hell does that mean? 
[01:15:00]  And if I wasn't completely exhausted, I just kind of went, uh-huh.  Anthony and I had a 20-minute conversation on the phone last night trying to figure out what blue sky it means.  What blue sky?  Like, it's a corporate term.  And I'm thinking it's some kind of jet analogy, like you take off and, like, and it's cloudy and it takes a while to get up above the clouds before you hit the blue sky.  The blue sky?  And then it's clear sailing.  You sure it wasn't blue guy?  Maybe a promo for this show?  Yeah, blue.  That might be it. 
[01:15:30]  So before we blue sky our ONA Twisted or Demented Christmas show we're going to attempt to do live on XM Satellite Radio here, we've got to wait for them to blue sky it, whatever that means.  I think it's when you're done with something, when everything's figured out and it's completed.  Like, if you're in a factory and you're building something, like a car or something, it rolls off the assembly line and then out the door.  Now it's under the blue sky.  Like, when you have an idea and then you run with it, you fix it, you have your meetings about it, now you're ready to put it out there into the outdoors, the blue sky. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, man.  You blue sky it.  I like my jet analogy better.  Yeah, but what if your jet takes off on a clear day?  It's blue skied right from the start.  It sure is.  You're still not up in the blue sky, though.  You still have to, you know...  There's blue sky under the runway.  But you still have to climb.  You're climbing up.  You're figuring it out.  You're figuring out what altitude to fly at.  I think you're looking too deep into it.  And then you even out that plane and you're off and running.  I think you're looking too deep into the blue sky thing.  Oh, crap.  Your pen... 
[01:16:30]  OCD alert.  It just flew over by the monitor.  OCD alert.  Nah, you don't need it.  Just forget about it.  Don't even think about it.  It's over there.  Where is it?  Just put it over there.  It's under the...  There you go.  Just don't tap it.  All is right with the world.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's crazy like that.  If he lost that pen, he'd be looking for it.  I got a little OCD crap.  It's little.  It's little stuff.  Anyway, yeah, so the blue sky thing.  Yeah.  We're going to try to blue sky this Christmas party there.  Corporate lingo stinks.  There's got to be a website for corporate lingo. 
[01:17:00]  I looked up some last night, yeah.  You did?  Yeah.  It wasn't all that good.  Not as good as the ones they make up in Washington.  What's the site?  www.boringdouche.com  The best one, though, is the whole...  I'm going to tee this up for you.  Tee it up.  I'm going to tee up this idea for you.  They like that one.  We're going to tee it up.  We're going to try to hit this down the fairway.  It might be a big slice, though.  Might hit the trap.  Or God forbid it ends up in the water.  Didn't use enough club.  But he's teeing it up for us.  He's teeing it up.  You know something?  When you have meetings with anyone involved with the Opie and Anthony show, 
[01:17:30]  you can refrain from using the corporate lingo.  You really can.  I understand it might fly well with another big corporation you're having a meeting with  or a client, perhaps, if you want them to buy the show or something.  But when you're dealing with people from this show, all we do is laugh at it and discuss  it when we hang up with you on the phone.  It's not something where we're like, yeah, let's blue sky.  We don't take the lingo in and start using it, aside from goofing on it. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  So you can really refrain from the corporate lingo.  Yeah, when you talk to us, use the word dude a lot.  That's fine.  Or hey, ass.  Hey.  Right.  Ass.  Something like that.  Yeah, we're going to, you know.  Let's bring it down a notch.  How about, let's discuss the idea, and when we're ready, we'll put it out there.  There you go.  There you go.  Instead, blue sky it after teeing it up.  All right.  Moving on.  By the way, if you're a really, really famous A-list celebrity and you want to call our  show today, give it a shot. 
[01:18:30]  The number's right there on your unit.  Your unit.  Let's see who's listening to us today.  Let's see the A-list celebrities come out of the woodwork today.  A, B, C, D-list.  We'll take a D-list celebrity at this point, okay?  This is like a fake George Clooney on the line.  Hey, George, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, George Clooney.  How you doing?  You know, gearing up for the big movie, Ocean something.  Well, it's Ocean 12.  It's Ocean 12, which is very clever, because the last movie was Ocean 11. 
[01:19:00]  Well, they're pretty smart like that here in Hollywood.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks for the exclusive interview.  That was awesome, George.  Thanks, George.  I had to be excited.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, how was it playing Batman?  Did I play Batman?  Yes, you did, George.  Did you enjoy your time on ER?  Yes, it was very exciting being on the doctor's show there.  So, what do you got in the works now after this thing here?  The Ocean 12 movie.  Yeah.  Who was your favorite leading lady to work with? 
[01:19:30]  Was it Joe on the Facts of Life?  That chick with the black hair on ER.  She was all right.  Yeah.  Did you ever bang her in real life?  Nah.  Nah, you know, George is a little dull.  George, what happened to your voice?  It sounds a lot higher on the phone than it does in real life, you faggot.  Well, that's a big Hollywood effect they put on there, Ant.  You know, without the A-list celebrities, you probably don't know all these secrets.  Yeah.  We don't look like this, but then they put in a special Hollywood effect. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Well, thank you.  There he goes.  George Clooney, our first A-list celebrity interview.  Well, we're going to have to drill down that list of celebrities to see if we could get any.  That's a good one.  We'll have to drill down.  All right.  We got the McGreevy farewell speech, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  You want to set this up for the people of Missouri and Texas and Alabama and Tennessee and Georgia?  Is that an action item you just put in there? 
[01:20:30]  I'm trying to use some corporate lingo.  We have to drill down on that.  Oh, wow.  You got the list?  I have a list of some corporate lingo.  All right.  Give us a few here.  Drill down.  Drill down.  That's for someone to examine something in detail, feature by feature, regardless of level of management.  Oh, my God.  There was another one recently.  Really?  That was told to us.  What was it?  That hasn't, when they're making deals, XM Satellite Radio making deals every single day. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  And we hear about some of these deals they may be making.  Yeah.  But they don't want us to talk about it yet because it hasn't, what?  Fill in the blank.  It was one of the classic ones we heard recently.  They're working on a deal.  Yeah.  They don't want us to talk about it because it hasn't, mm, yet.  Oh, oh, oh.  Damn, I can't remember.  I keep thinking like incubated or something.  Baked. 
[01:21:30]  Baked.  It hasn't been baked.  It still hasn't been baked.  That made me physically ill.  I swear to God, we heard that one from a lawyer lady.  They're working on something, but we can't talk about it yet because it hasn't baked yet.  You know what it is?  Corporate people are trying so hard.  I know what that means.  What?  The deal hasn't been signed.  Hasn't baked yet.  We've been working on that offline.  We've heard offline.  Offline.  Offline.  A term meaning at another unspecified meeting suggesting that an uncomfortable or technically 
[01:22:00]  complex topic be taken offline is an excellent way to put off its further discussion indefinitely.  Put that offline.  Take that offline.  Oh, this stuff makes me nauseous.  We got a guy that knows what blue sky is.  Oh, he does?  I think so.  Peter in Jersey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  First, let me tell you guys, you guys rock, man.  I've been listening to you guys since you guys were on NEW from the early days.  Thank you, my friend.  It's funny because I'm listening to this and I'm an original sales manager with a small 
[01:22:30]  company out of North Carolina and I got to deal with these stupid bullshit terms all  the time and everybody always wants to blue sky any idea we ever started.  Basically what it is, it's what they want to do is they just want to, it's almost like  taking a white piece of paper.  They want to blue sky it.  Like when you paint a picture, you got to start with a blue sky before you put anything  else on it.  So they want to start from nothing and look like build it from scratch.  Oh, now that's something we didn't see coming. 
[01:23:00]  Nice.  So it's starting from scratch.  We're going to blue sky it and just plan from there.  Exactly.  And it drives me nuts.  We got this bitch regional sales manager from the Midwest who wants to blue sky every  idea that comes up.  Well, let's blue sky it.  I want to fucking strangle half of you.  You know what this is all about?  I mean, these corporate people, their jobs are very boring, you know, and they're trying  to, you know, throw some excitement into it, you know?  But the fact is, it's just boring. 
[01:23:30]  It's black or white.  That's what their jobs are.  It's just black or white.  They don't want to be the boars that they are.  Right.  That's it.  I'm a 34-year-old regional sales manager that was in Mulcahy 10 years ago.  And I don't want to deal with this.  Just tell me what's going on.  Tell me the story.  Let me answer your question.  Let's move on.  All right.  Thank you, Peter.  All right, guys.  You got it.  All right.  Sync up.  We're going to sync up on that issue to have a meeting, especially, not necessarily between 
[01:24:00]  two people, evidently borrowed from the Palm Pilot lexicon.  Sync up.  They can't just say, hey, let's have a meeting.  No.  Let's sync up about the blue skying, that issue that we spoke about.  And while you're at it, we need a couple of new buckets.  Yeah.  And by the way, we should also tee up ourselves.  Ugh, assholes.  Proactive own.  You know what own means?  To take responsibility for something.  Someone who owns something can never claim that they are out of the loop. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, I own that.  Great.  Results-driven scope creep.  What is a scope creep?  I don't know.  You tell me.  The gradual inflation of the goals of a project as its leaders imagine more things for it  to do.  So the scope of it is creeping upward.  So it's an idea that kind of gets bigger and has more things put on it. 
[01:25:00]  I figured it was a guy with binoculars whacking his bag in some chick's bushes.  Is that scope creep again out of my window?  It's such a sad existence.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, guys.  I know you work hard.  You go up into the office every day with your suit and everything.  What's with these words?  What a...  I'm so glad I'm in radio in this capacity.  Thank God.  Okay. 
[01:25:30]  Quick break.  Then we'll get to the McGreevy farewell speech.  All right?  And other things, obviously.  We do have a few guests calling in today.  Who do we have today, Ben?  We have some 9-11...  Who do we got?  The L-List.  I'm sure it's huge.  Here we go.  Got that call from Johnny Depp back, did you?  Here we go.  Johnny Depp's in at 9 o'clock.  Brittany's performing live at 8.  On that definite whatever.  Bono and the Edge are going to come by and have some Guinness with us.  Nice.  You're psyched.  We're going to have the guest rundown every day with Ben.  All right, Ben?  Great.  Who do we have today on the show? 
[01:26:00]  We have Jonathan Gold, who wants to talk about...  He has some theories on 9-11.  Okay.  It's going to be very interesting.  Ah.  And Dom Morena.  Is that how you say it?  Dom Morena.  We don't...  Dom Morena.  I'm sorry.  Guests so good, we don't even know their names.  What did I say?  Dom Morena.  What did I say?  Dom Morena, you said.  Dom Morena.  Who the hell is he?  I think that was the guy that Vito Corleone stabbed.  Rich Vass.  Antonio Andolini.  Dom Morena. 
[01:26:30]  Sorry.  All right, I can't wait to talk to Dom Morena.  Wasn't that a dance a few years ago?  Hey, Dom Morena.  He was the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins.  You remember him?  Yeah.  Dom Morena.  Maybe that's why he can't get guests.  He's asking for Johnny Dupe.  You're like, who?  I want Frank Clooney, and I want him now.  I can get Rich Vass.  That's as good as I can get.  Dude, I want Pete Osborne in this studio.  Well, this is going to be hell.  I love that George Clowney.  Sure. 
[01:27:00]  He's good.  I didn't know what Ben was doing yesterday.  Ben's like, look, I just want to black sky this.  Sorry.  This show is so stupid.  Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Hey, Dom Morena.  Jesus.  I'm going to call him Dom Morena now.  Dom Morena.  He's a very funny comic.  Yeah, it is.  Dom Morena.  All right.  I wish he was in the studio.  A little hi, mom, I'm in jail as we go to break here, Anthony.  I think this one is the time it went horribly wrong. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  I think the mom starts crying or something, but we'll do this, and then we'll do some other  things, and you'll laugh, and you'll laugh, and you'll laugh.  What?  Did he get me?  No.  Not really, right?  Oh, good.  Hello, Mark.  Yo.  Are you ready to play hi, mom, I'm in jail?  Sure.  All right, now, what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I don't know.  I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of prostitutes.  Wow, that could be pretty good.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I haven't been to jail in, like, about eight years, so.  So she thinks you've cleaned up your act, huh?  Yeah, and I'm happily married, you know? 
[01:28:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, and you're married, and you got caught with the prostitutes?  Yeah.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good.  Here we go.  Yeah?  Ma.  What?  Listen, it's Mark.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail.  What?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got caught with a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this?  Mark.  It's your son, Mark.  Where are you?  I'm in jail.  Downtown. 
[01:28:30]  Don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You.  With what?  Oh, get away.  I don't know.  You can't.  Don't call.  Don't call my house.  Oh, this call's being monitored, ma'am.  Oh, okay.  The police department.  I didn't know if you were joking with me, or if you're serious or what.  Mom, serious.  We've set.  Oh, jeez.  We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That will be cash.  $5,000?  Yes.  What did he do?  He was found with a couple of prostitutes, one of which was a transvestite. 
[01:29:00]  And it's a serious charge, ma'am.  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma.  What?  Can you come?  We've got to clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins.  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We know also the prostitute has tested positive for the AIDS virus, which is another problem  he's going to have to deal with. 
[01:29:30]  Hello, ma'am.  Yes, I'm here.  Oh.  Where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am.  What?  Well, I don't know how to tell you how this happened.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I picked him up with a couple of them.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I know.  I know.  Your mother sounds very upset.  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  And look at what happens.  Oh, my God.  She's so upset.  I can't do this anymore.  Ma!  I can't do this.  Ma!  Hey, ma!  Excuse me, ma'am.  Yeah?  Happy Mother's Day, ma!  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  This was the worst.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, man.  Oh, no.  Ma!  She's all right.  He's fine.  He's not in jail.  It's only...  Ma, you're live on the radio.  You could smack him in the head. 
[01:30:30]  Mom, you still there?  Yeah.  Talk to us, Mom.  Look how upset...  Oh, my God.  Dude.  I got to make a phone call.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No.  Oh, my God.  Usually, I can joke with him, you know.  I'm always joking with him.  Oh, no.  I'm always joking with him.  Oh, we feel horrible now.  You've got to smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro.  Oh, no.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Bye.  Oh, no.  That one didn't work well. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, my God.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony of you life.  Hey, fuck you, office, Mac.  Why don't you hire some fucking people who speak English, you stupid fuck?  Maybe if you do that, I won't piss all over your door handle anymore, you cocksuckers.  Hey, I just want to say, fuck you, you fucking bastard, Wayne.  Yeah, this is me, Tony.  I just want to say fuck you to the guys for arresting my audience out on the sidewalk. 
[01:31:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big ass use to the idiots on the message boards that are saying that the Opie and Anthony show is getting too sexy.  It can never be too sexy.  Fuck all you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Oh, fuck you very much.  Flower shop?  Yeah, hello.  Is this a flower shop?  It is.  Yeah, this is Spoonie Love from up above. 
[01:32:00]  I want to send some flowers to somebody.  Two dozen red roses.  And on the card that we're going to attach to the roses, what would you like?  Oh, I got the cards and all that.  Okay, let me see what I want.  Okay.  Now, it's the small card, you know, that little enclosure card.  You might have to put two in there because I got some things I want to say to her.  Okay.  What would you like?  Yo, baby, I love you.  Okay.  I love you more than you know.  Okay.  But you did me wrong. 
[01:32:30]  Give one dude a BJ, shame on you.  Okay.  Give two dudes a BJ, shame on me.  Okay.  If you think I can't get to you, you're wrong.  Uh-huh.  You ain't nothing but a stupid hoe.  You've always been a stupid hoe, and you will always be a hoe.  Got that?  Uh-huh.  Love always, your teddy bear. 
[01:33:00]  Spoonie.  S-P-O-O-N-Y?  Yeah.  Could you read that back to me, please?  Oh, I got it right.  Could you read it?  I know, but I just want to make sure.  Could you read it back to me?  Oh, no.  Could you read that back to me, please?  Let me see if I can even write this.  You might have to come in and write it.  Okay.  What was wrong?  The whole message?  The whole or the whole?  The whole message?  Yeah.  When I call her a hoe and stuff?  Yeah.  Could we change the word hoe, then? 
[01:33:30]  You know another word for hoe?  No, all of you.  Do you know another word for hoe that we could use?  We can't put sexual messages on there.  Hosexual?  What would you say?  I mean, what would you suggest?  I would just say, I'm sorry.  My cousin, she gave two of my cousins BJs on Thanksgiving Day.  I just went and put a call.  Right on Thanksgiving Day at my mother's house.  She gave them both BJs and I was in the closet.  Because I ain't believe it.  I love my woman.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:34:00]  I loved her, you know?  But we can put...  And I saw her for myself.  She was doing both of them at the same time.  On her knees.  Gagging and everything, yo.  I can put...  I love you.  Could we change BJs to smoking a sausage or something?  Blowing the pole?  I can't do anything like that.  What do you call a BJ?  I couldn't...  We can't do that.  We just can't do that.  Have you ever took part in that?  Have you ever been part in that?  Never given no one a BJ?  No.  No.  What? 
[01:34:30]  I just can't do that.  I call her on Thanksgiving Day.  Please, please, please.  Could you just read it back?  I can't...  I can't talk to you no more.  Ha ha!  Nah!  Yeah!  Ha ha ha!  That's me, man!  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time. 
[01:35:00]  On the Opie and Anthony Show,  we're gonna make fun of people  with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be  in the middle of the flight  and have him yank that handle  hoping candy comes out  and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out  except for him  because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, let's go to Max in Texas. 
[01:35:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  We're hanging.  I've got a sexual question for Jimmy.  All right, Max.  Last night, I was banging this chick  and we were 69  and I was giving her some finger action  and I must have touched her G-spot or something  because she squirted all over the place  and it blew me away. 
[01:36:00]  And first, I was pissed.  I was like,  God damn it,  this bitch gave me a golden shower  and I wasn't expecting it.  And I remember she used the bathroom  before we started doing anything.  So far, by the way,  this sounds more like a soliloquy  than it does a question.  Well, it's just,  has that ever happened to you before?  Because I had to look that up on the computer  when we got done  and it's called female ejaculation.  I've had one girl in my life who did that,  a girl I used to have come over.  I used to have to lay towels down  because she put probably 
[01:36:30]  a two foot by two foot stain on the mattress.  No, no, no.  It was the only girl I've ever had  that would do that  and it would sound like this.  Yeah.  Like a water pistol hitting my chin.  It was the hottest thing ever.  It was.  Dude, it was sexy.  After I thought about it,  I got to work  and I had to pull over somewhere  and squeeze off a batch, man.  I was like, damn.  What a car jack.  Wow, look at that.  The other thing, too,  was there's about five or six of us  at our terminal down in Dallas 
[01:37:00]  and we keep wondering  when you're going to come to Dallas  because we want to take you  to the Key Club or the Lodge, Jimmy.  I've been to the Lodge.  We've been to the Lodge.  It's great.  Oh, yeah, you were there with me, right?  Oh, my God.  It's a strip club  and it looks like an old hunting lodge  and the girls, you know,  give you lap dances  as you eat some of the best steak  you'll ever have.  Steak and lobster.  And it's fantastic.  Wow.  It's a great joint.  If any three of you guys  get down there or whatever,  just, you know,  make the announcement  and we'll come pick you up  and bring you there  and have a blast.  He was so worked up  and we got a blue sky's cock  right there in the car. 
[01:37:30]  Guys, have a good one.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yes, female ejaculation.  Okay.  Something I don't think  is all that hot.  Oh, come on.  It's the hottest.  Sheila, I swear to God,  a stain,  I'm opening my arms wide  and making a circle.  Yes.  A huge permanent stain  on the mattress.  It was just non-stop liquid.  So, um...  It made me so happy.  Enjoy.  So, track five  of the new U2 CD.  Yeah, let's get that in there.  No?  What's going on  with those cameras? 
[01:38:00]  I don't know.  I just noticed them.  Yeah, they've been there.  Oh.  Have they moved?  We talked about it yesterday, Steve.  I couldn't hear you.  Are they remote controlled?  Yeah, I don't know.  There are eyes in the sky  and we want to put them online  so people can check out  the radio show.  Yeah.  Good.  We're waiting to see  if that's possible.  All right?  All right.  Anthony, Governor McGreevey.  Yes.  Did you see his farewell speech  last night, Opie?  I sure did, Anthony.  I sure did.  It was exciting.  He got up there  and he's resigning. 
[01:38:30]  Hold on.  We got a squirter on the line.  What?  Sorry.  I love the fact  that we have ADD  on this program.  Snatch.  Yeah?  From Illinois.  Your wife is a squirter.  Oh, yeah.  She squirts all over the place.  And it's not...  And she's not taking a leak, right?  No, no, no, no.  She takes a leak before,  takes a leak after.  She, uh...  Just like Jimmy said,  she's all over the fucking place.  Where does this stuff come from?  I hear it's like a little sack  deep inside the woman 
[01:39:00]  or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a viscous fluid.  No!  I don't know.  Oh, gee, no.  It's so hot.  Yeah, it's something like that.  I mean, it's warm stuff.  I mean, it comes out of this...  You know, I don't know exactly  where it comes from, but...  I hear this stuff...  I hear this stuff ruins...  Ruins mattresses.  Huh?  I hear it ruins mattresses.  There's so much that comes out sometimes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She...  We gotta put down  fucking rubber sheets,  towels,  whatever we got. 
[01:39:30]  You're a lucky man.  I would love that  all over my face.  God, is that hot.  Oh, Jimmy, you know,  if there ain't nothing better  than going down there  and eating that thing  and that thing just  fucking squirts all over you.  You should look like  a little shih tzu  after it puts his face  in a puddle.  And I gotta...  There you have it.  All right.  I got a flavor saver,  you know, so...  Oh, you got a mustache, too?  Walking around the office  all day just stinking. 
[01:40:00]  No, no, I wash off.  I got a big old beard, though,  and man, sometimes,  yeah, you just fucking  get up and eat that thing  and squirt it all over.  This is none hot.  There is none hot  going on here  because it is disgusting.  Yeah, you're ruining...  This guy's a psycho.  You can tell he's probably  got, like, little pieces  of jelly donut  and, you know,  female ejaculate  in his beard.  A rubber band.  We interrupt this program  for the ozone midget sighting 
[01:40:30]  of the day.  Midget sighting.  Chris and Jersey,  what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm on my way to work.  I stopped to get gas  at a mobile gas station  and almost ran over  a little midget  that came to pump  the gas in my car.  Ooh, you gotta watch him.  He was pumping your gas?  Yeah, he barely came up  to the gas tank.  Did he look all pathetic  like having to put the pump  over his head  to get it into the gas?  And did he have, like,  a regular person-sized  gas station attendant shirt  just tucked in  so, like, the name piece  is down by his belt? 
[01:41:00]  Well, the best part was  his belt came up  to his chin.  His pants were pulled up  all the way to his neck.  That's great.  Ah.  His little awful dickies.  Cuffed little dickies.  Could you swipe your own card,  please?  Could you swipe your own card?  I can't, uh...  I can't reach it.  Oh, how sad.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  You should have done  the world a favor  and threw a little gas on him  and lit a match  and drove off.  He wouldn't even have  burned long.  He just would have went  and that would have  been the end of him.  Ah, Jamie, 
[01:41:30]  what's going on?  Hey, how much, man?  All right.  Hey, um...  The wind is squirting, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  I'm punching out.  We can't hear you, fellas.  Call back when you get  a better line.  We'll be here.  We'll be here for you.  It's Tom in North Carolina.  Go ahead real fast, Tom,  because we've got  to get to this audio.  All right.  I've got a multiple  squirter story for you.  Jim, you'll love it.  Okay.  I met these friends  and they were swingers  and they invited me  to go to a gangbang  and there was a handful  of ladies there 
[01:42:00]  and the one lady  that I used to be with  a lot,  she would squirt  and they would call me  just to come over  and make me let her squirt.  Then at the gangbang,  they were getting in line.  The ladies were one  after the other  and none of these ladies  had squirted before  but it must be something  about what I know  how to do  and they were going  one right after the other.  Yeah, yeah,  because you're just  an old man.  Not just me,  but these ladies  that once they let  themselves go,  they know how to do it  and they love it  and it just,  Jim's right,  it's all over the bed,  this guy's bed. 
[01:42:30]  It was all soaked.  It had a feather mattress  on it at all.  I like that a lot.  I wouldn't want  my bed soaked on.  I would like to put  towels down  because the bed  that I used to do it on  was the one  that my grandmother  used to sleep on  before she died.  Nice.  I'm such garbage.  Nice.  Your grandma  took pride in that bed  and made sure  it was all nice.  Her squirt  and grandma's  baby powder  all caking up  making a nice dough  on the mattress. 
[01:43:00]  Well, we couldn't  pull the thing  off the mattress  because it wasn't  baked yet.  Eric in Minnesota.  Hey, Eric.  Hey.  Come on, real fast.  We're trying to get  past this topic  really fast.  Oh, man,  I got one hell  of an experience, too.  I just had a girlfriend  and I was eating on her.  Next thing you know,  I'm kissing her,  finger banging her,  and oh, my God,  it was wet down  to her ankles  and I just fell  in love with her.  I mean,  unreal,  I can't get over 
[01:43:30]  this woman.  It happens all the time  with her.  I mean,  it's just awesome.  Something about  the Minnesota accent  makes it not quite  as sexy.  Hey.  Oh, yeah,  you're going to drop  some of that  on my chin,  are you?  Yeah, yeah.  I made quite a mess  on my mattress, Margie.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How come no girls  who are squirters  are calling in?  Because we don't have  any women that listen  to the show  thanks to that guy  right there.  How about you could say,  um, girls, squirt,  and then plug a toaster 
[01:44:00]  in and hold it.  That's the reason.  Thanks for that line, Jim.  He has a problem  with women.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Sebastian.  Sebastian.  Yes.  Where are you calling from?  Hey, I'm actually  from Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  Originally,  I'm from Poland.  Where are you calling  from right now?  I'm from New York City.  All right,  you're here in the city?  I'm watching you  actually every morning  and you guys rock.  And I had the girl  actually a couple years ago. 
[01:44:30]  So when she had organs,  she squirted too.  So that was hot.  That was awesome, man.  How hot is it, uh, squirt?  Well, when she had the orgasm,  that was not like all the time,  but, you know,  once in a while,  but that was hot.  That's how we kept warm  in Poland.  We would have her squirt  and it was warm  for maybe five minutes.  We were able to sleep  under communism.  Isn't that the G-spot orgasm?  I don't know, actually.  I can't comment.  All I know is  it's a body temperature 
[01:45:00]  viscous fluid  that shoots onto your chin  and in your face.  Very clear, right?  Very clear.  No odor.  Odorless.  Odorless.  When you stab them  in the chest.  Good point.  Same description.  All right, well, Steve.  Welcome to the O.P.  and Anthony.  Ah!  Steve's taking notes  for more abuse promos.  He can't wait.  He can't wait  to get back  into his production studio.  All right,  so I want to set up  the McGreevy thing, Anthony.  He's the governor of Jersey  and they discovered 
[01:45:30]  he was gay.  Discovered?  Yeah.  Well, he came out  and said it a while back  and they said he was resigning  and it's come time  for him to resign.  Leave office  and just be a civilian gay man  in America.  That's right.  And that's what he's doing.  So he had his farewell speech  yesterday.  Kind of an apology.  Thank you to his staff.  I'm off.  Ha-ha.  You know,  kind of leaving office.  And he's going to be replaced  I guess next week  or something.  Yeah, hold on.  I've got to get a... 
[01:46:00]  I've got to get more.  Quite the shock, though.  He was kind of embroiled  in scandal  and he made his speech  a couple of months ago  and everyone was just  expecting him  to either step down  or talk about the scandal  and then when he stood up there  and said he was gay,  you heard the whole...  All the press  in the audience  just go...  It was a shocker.  Real shocker.  Because he had a wife.  He had a wife.  Who, during that gay announcement  he had on his arm. 
[01:46:30]  Dragged her out there.  She was...  She looked a little drugged.  Didn't she?  When they brought her out  she was just emotionless.  And he announced  he was gay.  She's just standing there  like a useless piece of crap.  Yeah.  Just knowing everyone's looking  going,  ah, you couldn't...  Yeah.  You couldn't satisfy her.  You just laid there  with your head to the side  didn't you, stupid?  You couldn't make him happy  could you?  Would you need Leon  if Angela did the right thing?  Can I interrupt this intro?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because we have a squirter  on the line. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, a real one?  I do believe.  Shannon from Ohio.  Hey, Shannon.  Shannon?  Oh.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Don't move.  Don't move, Shannon.  I had to move some buttons  around for this McGreevy thing  so I have to take her over here.  Shannon, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  So you're a squirter?  I am.  We're in Ohio.  I can't tell you that.  Okay.  I'm getting ready to go to work.  That would just be  a dead giveaway.  That's fine.  So...  Who'd you vote for?  Who'd I vote for?  Bush.  Ah, the swing state.  Yes.  Of Ohio. 
[01:47:30]  I was worried about us  there for a little bit.  Yeah, you guys kind of  wrecked the election  for the Democrats.  You were the state, though,  this time around.  Last time it was Florida.  You guys were the state, man.  I know.  All eyes were on Ohio.  I would just think  there'd be more Democrats  in Ohio, but...  Well, obviously,  very wrong.  Democrats.  So you're a squirter?  What's the deal  with this squirting thing?  Explain it to us.  Dude, I don't know.  All I know is that  when my husband  goes down on me,  it's just...  Something comes over me,  and right at the moment,  it just...  I didn't even know it 
[01:48:00]  until he told me  that I was doing it,  but he finds it really hot,  and it feels awesome.  I'm gagging.  That is so sexy, man.  I'm feeling this a little bit.  No.  It's not like  a little pan on your face.  That would be fine, too.  I hear a lot of women  think that they're taking a leak  and they're embarrassed by it,  but then when they realize  it's a whole different thing  going on,  then they're fine with it.  Well, honestly,  that's what I thought  the first time, too,  and he was just like,  no, no, it's not pee.  It doesn't stink.  It's like gagging me  because I'm just thinking  of getting a mouthful  of, like,  Bavarian cream 
[01:48:30]  shoved in your throat.  No, no, no, it's not  that type of a texture.  It's a clear,  it's a clear viscous  body temperature fluid.  It's the viscous part  that's killing me here.  I think I'm thinking  that it's like snot  or jizz or something,  but it's not like that.  No.  It isn't.  It's a very clean fluid.  It isn't technically  called mucus.  It's a very clean fluid.  Isn't it mucus?  No, no, no.  It's not like that at all.  It's like a clear,  kind of like,  not even jelly  or sticky  or anything like that. 
[01:49:00]  Right, it's stored  in the body somewhere.  It's a little pouch  filled with a body  temperature clear.  It's filled to the tippy top.  Filled to the tippy top  of viscous fluid.  Jimmy's doing this  to get to me  because it is.  It takes a very special man  to come up with that kind of thing.  If water breaks,  it's probably the same temperature  as a pregnant woman's  water breaking.  Oh, my God.  It's this 98.6 degree fluid.  Yeah.  So what kind of cleanup  do you guys have to go through?  What's the consistency? 
[01:49:30]  Would you say more like  30 weight motor oil  or some maybe corn oil  or peanut oil  or is it like water  mixed with...  What?  It's like water.  More water.  It's like water.  Yeah.  It's basically  just exactly like water.  But is it slick?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  You're right.  It is actually a good call.  But it's not like oil.  It doesn't have that thickness.  No.  It's a water  with a little bit of slickness  probably just because  it's been in the canal  for so long. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  So what kind of cleanup  do you guys have to do  after this?  We either do like a clean...  Like a...  Like a shop vac.  No, no.  I'm not like  spencing gallons  onto the mattress.  No?  Not like that, no.  It's more like just, you know,  a little hand towel,  a little washcloth.  Maybe grab my guys' underwear.  No.  All right.  See what you got to do.  Well, thank you, Shannon.  Hey, you're welcome.  Do you guys want to try  to become the sexiest state  in America someday?  No, but I'll play  Guess What's In My Pants.  Okay.  I don't want to put her head  under my shoulder  and grab her belly 
[01:50:30]  and use it like a super soaker.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Surprise!  Shannon, here's the deal  because we're getting  a little busy.  If you hear that the show  is really falling apart,  call back and we'll play  Guess What's In My Pants.  That's good.  Actually, why don't we get  her number and we'll play  maybe tomorrow.  Hold on, Shannon.  Or maybe later today.  We've got to figure it out, okay?  You sound like a pool skimmer.  We interrupt this program  for another Ozone Midget Siding.  It's Rick in South Carolina.  Go ahead, Rick.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Rick.  Can I say something real quick?  Yeah.  My brother's the one 
[01:51:00]  who called up and said  something about the  Tony Danza bit.  I had to pull off  on the side of the road.  I was laughing so hard.  Which Tony Danza bit?  We've done a lot of them.  The one where you guys  were supposedly giving away  the prizes trying  to get somebody on stage.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Classic, classic radio, guys.  All right, thank you.  All right, funny  Midget Siding for you.  Yeah.  Going to a shoe store  to just go buy  a pair of running shoes  and I'm sitting there  and I see a box of shoes  moving by itself  behind the display 
[01:51:30]  in front of me.  Next thing I know,  I see this little  short guy coming out  with his little tiny hands  trying to hold on  to his big box of shoes  from the backside of it.  I thought the place  was haunted  until he came  walking on the other side.  That's creepy, nice.  He's out there,  he's helping a customer  and he can't even  hardly hold on  to the shoes  because his hands  are so little.  The guy's got like  a size 14 shoe.  Oh, yeah, big feet  but little hands?  I mean, I'm not telling you,  I'm not telling you,  the customer he means.  Oh.  Not the midget.  He must have been  thinking about  hanging himself 
[01:52:00]  with those shoelaces  or something.  I thought the midget  had big feet  and those little  puffy hands.  No, he probably  sleeps in that shoe.  All right.  Oh, those fingers  where it just looks like  breakfast sausages  with knuckles  like all between them.  Little in the fingernails  that are just like  little circles on top  and...  All right, Rick, thank you.  How you doing?  Pleasure to meet you.  Oh, I gotta shake that thing.  And you wanna grab the hand  and just bite the palm  until he screams?  Oh, don't you?  It's so puffy. 
[01:52:30]  And the whole arm  looks like something  off a chicken.  It's like that bent up  puffy  puffy arm  and...  Oh.  Just wanna break it  like a snap  of a drumstick  off a thigh.  They all should have  hanger marks  in their heads.  Those midget signings  just made me giggle.  Oh, I love it.  He saw the box  moving, Opie,  and then he realized  it was a midget behind...  Cody from Buffalo.  I had to flip my mattress over  because of a squirting bitch  when I was 16.  And Justin from Utah. 
[01:53:00]  The fluid from  the female ejaculation  comes...  has the same chemical properties  as male sperm  and only occurs  when a woman  is totally relaxed  and positive  in the moment, Anthony,  with no fears  of the partner.  Fluid secrets  from a bag  near the colon.  Fluid secrets?  What?  Does it?  What?  It doesn't secrete?  It's secrets?  Fluid secretes?  It's a secret.  It's a secret.  No, that is...  Fluid secrets.  Wait, wait, wait.  I gotta see that. 
[01:53:30]  Why?  Because I just wanna see  if the word colon is there.  No, no, no.  I'm not...  Well, colon, C-O-L-A-N.  He has everything spelled wrong.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was like  secret fluid,  but it's, yeah,  fluid secretes.  Secret fluid.  From the...  Fluid ejaculates,  chemical...  Male sperm?  Same chemical properties  as male sperm?  Except for the sperm cells.  What is it?  Like semen fluid?  Yeah, it's that...  Seminal fluid?  Yeah, whatever the chemical...  And only occurs  when a woman is totally relaxed  and positive in the moment  with no fears about... 
[01:54:00]  Fluid secretes  from a bag near the colon?  Stop it.  Yeah.  No way.  I've heard it's some kind of like...  Yeah.  It's a secreting bag  near the colon.  It's a body temperature fluid.  I was just saying.  Go ahead, say it.  What?  That is...  It's a viscous  body temperature fluid  that hangs out by the colon  and has a seminal quality to it.  All right, listen.  We have to play  some of this audio, okay?  I'd drink it out of a cup.  So, uh...  McGreevy.  McGreevy's speech  is going to be hotter  than this conversation. 
[01:54:30]  I know.  Another midget sighting.  We've got to come...  Oh, God.  This one's good, though.  Now you're captivated.  We interrupt this program  for another Ozone midget sighting.  It's Jared in Maine.  What's up, Jared?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hi, fella.  Driving down the interstate  in Maine yesterday.  Yeah.  See a car off  in the breakdown  laying the four-ways  going off there.  See a guy  on the outside  changing a tire.  Come to find out  it was a midget  standing there  changing a tire. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, you thought  he was like on his knees  like a normal human being  would be changing a tire?  How convenient is that?  That's your tire level.  Have a good day.  Did you see him  with his hands  clutching the hubcap  and his feet resting  on the bottom of the tire  just tugging  like his whole body  off the ground  on that hubcap?  Ah!  Come on!  Get on!  With that huge lug wrench  that's as big as him?  Grabs the tire  to pull it off  it comes off  and him and the tire  go rolling down  the interstate. 
[01:55:30]  Alright, listen.  Listen.  No more midget sightings today.  If you have one  there's a midget security guard  look, guys.  Freeze, motherfucker!  Remember what I said  about this program.  It's all about variety.  Let's spread out  the midget sightings, okay?  Call tomorrow.  How would a midget  be a security guard?  Freeze or I'll touch you.  Gary Coleman.  Alright, I just made a bad joke.  Who, by the way,  is still on hold.  Okay, now researchers believe  that female cum 
[01:56:00]  is produced by the  skein's glands, Opie.  The skein's glands  remember this for  what did we learn today?  Yes.  Which are located  in a woman's urethra  and are made of tissue  that's similar to the  composition to a man's  prostate gland.  Hmm.  Chemical analysis  of female ejaculate  revealed the presence  of high levels  of prosthetic acid  phosphates,  a chemical secreted  by the prostate gland. 
[01:56:30]  Skein's glands  not unlike Wayne's brothers.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, a chemical secreted  by the prostate gland  and found in semen.  This would seem  to indicate  that a woman's  ejaculation  is similar  in composition  to semen  only without  the sperm,  of course.  Yeah.  Gah!  Holy shit!  Why?  It's in the urethra  and the body  squeezes the fluid out. 
[01:57:00]  What's wrong with that?  It's hot.  You know when you  get all worked up  and you're just  fiddling about  a little bit  and you get  the clear stuff  that you always talk about?  I get it all the time.  The little pre  that comes out?  I love it.  That's the stuff, guys.  Good.  That's the stuff  you're getting  a face full of.  Slippery pre-cum.  That's from a chick.  It's fine.  As long as you're  not snowballing.  It's the same stuff,  though, they're saying.  The gland it comes out of 
[01:57:30]  is pretty much  like a female prostate.  So what?  It's in there  holding that fluid  that she gets turned on  and it just squeezes  it.  It rings like a cloth.  Like a cloth  full of viscous fluid  in your mouth.  Ring it out  into my mouth.  Nice and warm.  Stop!  And hates stuff  like this.  I love it.  Anthony was telling us  yesterday that he  hates sticky stuff.  I know.  I am insane  with sticky stuff.  You just see me  eating waffles  or pancakes  with syrup on it.  It's like  I'm in a hazmat suit.  It's like Outbreak. 
[01:58:00]  I need a hazmat suit.  I can't take  anything sticky,  anything  viscous.  It drives me crazy  because a little dot  of it,  a little dot  on your finger  that dripped  off the fork  because you were  holding it up  in your hand  too long.  That little dot  can spread out  until you're sticky  like behind  your kneecap.  Which drives me  crazy.  If they're sticky  anywhere,  joint bends  like in the back  of your finger 
[01:58:30]  or something  and it's going  like you bend  your finger  and you feel  that tearing  sticky thing,  I will go insane.  I will not be able  to concentrate  on anything  until I wash  it off.  I used to work  in construction.  You know that.  And when you're  trying to put ductwork  in an open wall,  you have to handle  some of the beams  that are in the wall,  the 2x4s.  A lot of these things  have sap in them.  Sap does not come off  with soap.  Ever.  It never comes off.  It just does not  come off.  It has to slowly  wear away. 
[01:59:00]  Dude, I would take  Brillo to my hands  to try to get rid  of this because it  would be in there  and I'd be yelling  like a madman.  I'm still sticky!  I'm still sticky!  This won't come off!  God damn it!  Hours later,  I'll be freaking out.  We all have problems  on this show.  Sticky is my  mortal enemy.  Yeah.  So when Jimmy  brings up things  like viscous fluid  and...  You ever touch  the bottom?  You ever been in the  diner and your hand  touches the bottom  of the diner table 
[01:59:30]  and it's sticky?  Oh!  No.  Never.  You ever had that?  Like you're reaching  down, just do one  in your pocket  and you hit the  bottom of the thing?  No, no.  If I'm watching a chick  like getting doused  in honey,  how they do that  in movies sometimes,  I can't watch.  It freaks me out  too much.  I have to turn it off.  That's how insane  I am about sticky.  Alright.  Well, why?  You were childhood  and you got sticky  once and you couldn't  get it off for a while?  Like maybe you were  at the park  and you got it  on your legs  or something?  I'm not even  making a pedophile joke.  That could be.  Maybe. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  I just have this thing  about being sticky  anywhere.  Yeah.  Could have been  an uncle.  Fire one.  I have a friend  who can't touch  cotton.  Really?  At all.  Earl.  I knew that joke  was coming.  Why?  What does cotton  do to him?  I'm not going to say  it's weird  after my sticky thing.  It's kind of like  what you're going  through with the sticky  I guess.  But sticky  is something  that does something  to you.  It was one of my  old roommates in college  and you're drinking  a lot and you've got  to take the aspirin. 
[02:00:30]  He couldn't even  open up his aspirin bottles  and take the cotton out.  The texture.  The texture.  Does that freak him  out a little bit?  It's like you ever  lick a napkin?  That drives me nuts.  It's like certain  textures on your body.  You know something?  You're just mentioning  that.  Give me this feeling  that maybe I don't  like that.  I've never even  noticed.  Stop even talking  about it because  you're making me  talk funny.  Hey, did you ever  bite into crisp  lettuce and your  upper lip goes up  a little bit?  Anyone?  I got one.  A nice big bite  of tinfoil.  A nice big mouthful 
[02:01:00]  of tinfoil.  It hurts your  feelings, right?  I dare you to do it  right now on the air.  It is brutal.  I can't talk.  You're freaking me out.  Would you lick a piece  of cotton?  No.  How about a big  napkin?  No, the napkin  licking thing, I've  never even thought  about this, but it's  upsetting me.  It dries your tongue  and it drags.  Yes, it does.  Stop it.  It almost tugs on  your tongue a little  bit.  Don't do it.  Wait. 
[02:01:30]  No.  He's doing it.  That is really  freaking me out and  I don't know why.  You go slow.  It starts off okay,  but as you get higher  up the towel or the  napkin.  Stop it.  Your tongue dries.  That's what happens.  Look at it.  He's driving Anthony  nuts.  Why is that upsetting  me?  Try it.  No.  Napkin.  No.  No.  Chew on some tinfoil.  No.  Chew on some tinfoil.  No.  That'll kill you.  Your tongue drags  over the, it's just  like, it's a weird  violating.  I don't like this.  No, it is.  It's horrible.  It's killing me. 
[02:02:00]  Why are you doing  that?  Don't do that anymore.  Can we get to this  audio?  I need water.  We haven't, we haven't  taken a break in like  an hour.  We could segue into  this.  We haven't done anything  on the show today.  Again.  You want to segue into  the McGreevy audio?  The McGreevy audio?  Yeah.  How about you took  this napkin and wrapped  it around a mule and  licked it?  Let me just sit in  that one.  That is really hot.  We're letting you sit.  Just simmer.  Simmer at a low boil.  Wow.  And it was just like 
[02:02:30]  I said, I said that by  going, want me to segue  into the McGreevy audio?  And everybody went,  all right, balls in your  court.  Let them roll.  Wow.  That was a Sheffield  swing.  I actually, I hurt my  back on that swing.  That's the type of swing  you fall.  What the hell is that?  Did it come out of the  water machine?  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, can I get some of  that?  You spitting this.  If we're not going to  take a break, we need  water and stuff.  Wrap it around your  mule. 
[02:03:00]  So, McGreevy's the  gay governor of Jersey.  He had his farewell  speech.  Farewell speech.  We figured we'd play a  little of this audio  today.  Adios!  So, you want to hear  some of this or what?  Sure.  I have to begin today  with humility by simply  saying I am sorry.  So, so sorry that  mistakes in my  judgment made this day  necessary for us all. 
[02:03:30]  I am sorry that my  actions have hurt those I  love in my personal and  political lives.  I am sorry to those who  vested their careers with  me that this abrupt  transition has caused them  upheaval.  What is this faggot crap?  And I am sorry that I have  disappointed the citizens of  the state of New Jersey who 
[02:04:00]  gave me this enormous trust.  To be clear, I am not  apologizing for being a gay  American, but rather for  having let personal feelings  impact my decision making.  Dude, this is gay.  And for not having had the  courage to be open about  whom I was.  Three simple words.  You see, today, I am gay.  I stand before you as a  changed man.  I am sorry.  Aeschylus said, in our sleep, 
[02:04:30]  pain which cannot forget  falls drop by drop upon the  heart.  Yes, I am gay.  Until in our own despair.  Yes, I am gay.  Against our will comes wisdom.  Yes, I am gay.  Through the awful grace of  God.  Gay, totally gay.  Like the psalmist of old, I  have asked God to create in  me a clean heart and to  renew a right spirit within 
[02:05:00]  me.  I stand before you as a man  who has experienced the  freedom that comes with the  truth.  You friggin' fag.  Claiming the promise, the  truth will set you free.  Like having your...  Just as Lincoln said that a  house divided against itself  cannot stand.  A-Ate me, pervert.  So, it is true with a  person.  A divided self is not an  integrated self.  And so, as I have been 
[02:05:30]  preparing for this day, I have  been doing some mending in my  soul.  In my ass.  Oh, you're a big tough  country faggot, ain't you?  Stop with the gay American.  We know.  I'm a gay American.  We know you're American.  He's got to talk it up.  This is his chance to appeal to  his future boyfriends and  people.  He's going to... 
[02:06:00]  Now, this is pretty much his  last public appearance.  He's got to really work it.  So, now he can go cruising.  And now I'm going to go to  Florida and try to govern  there because I like the shape  of the state.  Stupid sissy.  Those men wanted to have sex  with me.  Yes.  That's something.  We got more audio.  We could try it, see where it  goes.  Okay.  Listen to the first line here,  though.  You want to cue the music?  We could use some music  accompaniment here. 
[02:06:30]  Hit it.  I so want the words of my  mouth and the actions of my  hands.  What?  Oof.  Wait, that started really  weird.  Does he have to say that  knowing everyone's going to  go, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I so want the words of my  mouth and the actions of my  hands and the thoughts of my  heart to be one in the same  thing.  That brings proper alignment,  something true and whole. 
[02:07:00]  Whole.  Having apologized and shared  these recent reflections, I would  like to take a minute to  indulge in offers of gratitude  and to look back and celebrate  what you in this room have  accomplished.  I want to thank those in the  legislature and state  government in both parties who  over the years I have gotten to  know and to engage.  Engage?  The ideal common ground has 
[02:07:30]  been a genuine and passionate  commitment to serve and to give  their gifts to this state.  Even in the most jaded and cynical  moments, I have never doubted that  they each come to this place with a  firm conviction of their deeply held  beliefs to make this state a better  place.  You're a little bitch.  It has been a joy to serve with them.  You're a little bitch.  Thank you, my friends.  You're a little bitch.  For the joy and honor of working with 
[02:08:00]  you all of these years.  You friggin' fag.  If you're happy and you know it,  wave your flag.  What?  Yes, I am gay.  What was that?  I don't know.  I don't know what all these are.  I guess it's more of the same.  We don't have to continue.  Owl.  It's raining, man.  Owl.  What a gay say.  This couldn't be gayer.  You just picture AIDS flying around. 
[02:08:30]  I apologize for allowing that Israeli  poet to leave a warm, viscous fluid  all over my face.  Owl.  Owl.  Owl.  Our governor is gay.  Great.  All right.  Enough.  Get rid of that music.  Thank you.  Oh, I kind of liked it.  Sure you do.  You're not going.  Let's say hi to Ashley in PA.  Ashley. 
[02:09:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  I'm doing really good.  Me too.  Ashley.  Mmm.  Ashley.  That's a name only a hot girl can have.  That's right.  You can't be fat and say,  Hi, I'm Ashley.  How hot is Ashley?  I'm pretty hot.  Pretty hot?  Uh-huh.  Where are you from?  Pennsylvania?  Hazleton, yeah.  Hazleton.  Okay.  Not far from Reading.  No.  And why are you calling the show today?  Well, I want to play Call Your Mom, but mine is real. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, you want to confess something to your mom?  Uh-huh.  I slept with my dad's best friend last night.  How old are you?  Old enough.  How old are you?  Nineteen.  How old is your dad's best friend?  He's 38.  Oh, I want to whack my bag.  Is this real?  Yeah.  So how did this come about?  Well, I liked him for a while, and I just, I don't know. 
[02:10:00]  We got together last night.  Is your father's friend married?  Yeah.  He's married?  Yeah.  With kids?  No, he doesn't have kids.  Got you.  And is his wife hot?  She's all right, I guess.  And did you make the move, or did he?  We both did.  Both did.  So he's been coming over the house a lot?  We've been meeting in a secret location. 
[02:10:30]  Ooh, secret.  It's a secret.  It is.  Is it a parking lot?  No.  What kind of a location?  You don't have to give away the location.  What kind?  A hotel.  Ah, the old hotel.  Yeah.  He's pulling the old Butterfuco on her.  Is this a real story?  I swear, yeah.  All right, let's get her mom on the phone, but you got to tell the mom that she's going  to come on the radio.  All right?  Do we have your mom's number?  Yeah.  No, I got to give it to you.  All right, hold on.  Do it off the air or else everybody will be calling.  Hold on. 
[02:11:00]  Uh-huh.  They're getting nervous in Washington.  Relax.  We got to tell the mom that she's on the air.  We know all the laws.  Oh, wait.  Get Ben in here.  Hold on.  Mm-hmm.  Just say it's a radio show and, you know, your daughter has something cute she wants to  tell you.  Something cute.  All right.  All right, Ben.  Take that wispy hair in the other room.  And, you know, and the daughter's going to get a prize for getting her mom on the phone  and all that fun stuff.  Okay?  Ho-ho.  We'll set that up.  We'll see if that goes anywhere.  Should we play it off as the wacky DJs to keep her happy? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, we could do a little...  Hey, Mom, how you doing?  We could do a little wacky DJ thing.  Yeah.  And we got Dom Morena coming up in a few minutes.  Morena.  What an ass.  Ben.  Not Dom.  Ben.  And some 9-11 conspiracy freak.  Brad Clitt.  All right.  And some 9-11 conspiracy guy.  Yeah, why don't we take a break, man?  Cash up, nigga.  All my niggas in the P now, right now. 
[02:12:00]  Bubby, Hockey, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, nigga.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is...  Fuck my dick, because they ain't give me no money.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, Cash Up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Hello, I'm Rodney Carrington.  Dear penis. 
[02:12:30]  I don't think I like you anymore.  You used to watch me shave.  Now all you do is stare at the floor.  Oh, dear penis, I don't like you anymore.  It used to be you and me, a paper towel and a dirty magazine.  That's all we needed to get by. 
[02:13:00]  Now it seems things have changed.  I think that you're the one to blame.  Dear penis, I don't like you anymore.  Now he sings, dear Rodney, I don't think I like you anymore.  Cause when you get to drinkin', you put me places I've never been the more. 
[02:13:30]  Dear Rodney, I don't like you anymore.  Why can't we just get a grip on our man-to-hand relationship?  Come to terms with truly how we feel.  If we put our heads together, we'd just stay home forever.  Dear penis, I think I like you after all. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, and Rodney, while you're shavin', shave my bone.  XM-101, the joint brings the sounds of Jamaica across the ocean.  It can also be your daily trip to reggae country. 
[02:14:30]  XM-101 is reggae 24-7.  Have you had it with Reality TV?  If so, you might try the radio.  Hi, I'm Steve Karish, inviting you to check out Sonic Theater.  It's your home for books and drama here at XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:15:00]  We've got comedies, detective stories, thrillers, classic plays recorded live on stage,  and, of course, books.  It's Sonic Theater, XM 163.  The stories are on the radio, and the pictures are in your head.  XM 46.  The singer in question was Robert Plant.  The remarkable thing about my arriving at Pacey's house was,  A, that I'd been staying the week before with Terry Reid and his parents. 
[02:15:30]  Born in 1948 in Staffordshire, Plant had left home at 16 in order to pursue his passion for singing.  Beautiful materials flowing from the walls, and the howling wolf, incredible stereo blaring out.  And there I am with an old battered suitcase going,  What up, mate?  Hey, fellas, have you heard the news?  We're gonna run out of this back in town.  Top Traps, XM 46.  Oh, shit.  It's an Opie and Anthony Wow sticker stop.  This Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.  Head down to Envision Auto Accessories, 1164 Sunrise Highway in Paysure, New York. 
[02:16:00]  Whoa, those aren't real. Yes, they are.  Envision Auto Accessories is located off Exit 41 off Sunrise Highway,  South side of the service road, next to Bright Bay, GMC, Lincoln Mercury, and across from the Pally's gym.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The Wow sticker stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever. 
[02:16:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  I believe we have Ashley's mom on the phone here.  Let's see if this is Ashley's mom.  Ashley's mom?  Yes.  What's your name?  Janice.  Janice?  Yes.  How are you?  Pretty good.  All right.  Are you familiar with the Opie and Anthony Show?  No.  Oh, okay.  It's a cute little radio show we do.  Okay. 
[02:17:00]  We're pretty harmless.  Okay.  And your daughter's on the line and she wants to tell you something.  Okay.  I hope that's where she was.  Any idea in your head what it might be?  Hopefully where the hell she was last night.  Ah.  Why is that?  Was she missing?  Well, she was supposed to come home by like 1 o'clock because that's her curfew.  And I've been lying to her dad all fucking night about where she's been.  And I'm a little pissed.  Does she live with you still?  Yes.  She's got a little room that she's had since what? 
[02:17:30]  She was a little kid?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Set up the same way.  Stuffed animals and stuff?  Yeah.  She still stuffed animals.  And how old is she?  19.  And where did she say she was going last night?  She was going out to the movies and dinner.  And then she was going to be home after she went to some club up in Wilkes-Barre.  With friends?  Did she go to the movies?  Yeah.  That's what she said.  What friend?  Janine, why?  Oh, just wondering.  Janine, one of our good friends?  Yeah.  Yeah, Janine, she's a troublemaker, isn't she? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, she can be.  I'd rather not hang out with Janine.  A bad seed.  Yeah.  What movie were they supposed to go see last night?  The Grudge or something like that.  Ah, it's a little scary movie.  Ah, yes.  All right, let's put your daughter on the line here.  Okay.  This is Ashley.  Ashley!  Yeah?  Hi, we got your mom, Janice, on the phone here, and she's wondering where you were last  night until, how late there, Mom?  She never fucking came home at all.  Oh, Jesus.  She's still not home. 
[02:18:30]  She's still not home.  Well, maybe she's working.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Ashley?  Yeah?  Would you like to tell your mother where you were last night?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Mom?  Yes?  Um, I, God promised not to get mad, and I don't want you to tell Dad what I'm going to tell  you.  I've been lying to him all night.  What else do you want me to lie to him about?  Um. 
[02:19:00]  Don't use any last names, by the way.  Okay.  I slept with Fred last night.  Fred?  Daddy's friend?  Yeah.  What are you out of your mind?  I'm friends with...  Oh.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  I don't...  Oh, don't tell Dad.  Sure.  You tell Dad.  Oh.  And you're doing this to me on air?  Oh.  You're lucky your dad's never heard of this show.  Or he'd be in state pen by tonight, because he'll come... 
[02:19:30]  What are you getting all mad about?  Well, his age, and your age, and you're my baby, and he's fucking a baby?  Well, you're not, but you are.  You're my kid.  Well, Ashley, what happened last night?  Well, we went out to eat, and we went out to a movie, and then he took me to the hotel,  and we fooled around.  You don't have to worry about me telling your dad.  I'm going to go fucking kill him. 
[02:20:00]  What's this guy like, Janice?  Well, see, I guess, um, two-faced, I would say.  Um, he's been eating dinner here.  He's been eating dinner across the table with you since you're two years old.  Oh, my God.  I can't help it.  I'm attracted to him.  You're attracted to him.  Wait, you fooled around.  Yeah, you just kissed him, right?  No, we went all the way.  Oh, you slut.  Is this the first time? 
[02:20:30]  I'm not a slut.  It's my first time doing it.  What the fuck are you freaking out for?  Because he's 38 years old.  He just had his birthday.  Are you friends with this guy's wife?  Yes, I am.  And Lisa is not going to be, oh, my God.  Lisa is your godmother.  How am I going to even try and tell her this?  Lisa, the guy's wife, is the godmother of your daughter?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's a very sacred position to the Sicilian people. 
[02:21:00]  Ashley, you been fooling around with him a while or no?  I fooled around with him a couple times, yeah.  But this was the first time you went all the way last night?  Yeah.  And it was in a seedy hotel somewhere?  Yeah, it's in Hazleton.  Yeah, every hotel here is a seedy.  Mom, what are you going to do?  Are you going to tell the wife, maybe?  No.  Mom, you better not.  I don't want you to tell anybody.  I just didn't want you to tell anybody.  You take me on the radio, and you don't want me to tell anybody. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, you have some nerve.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ashley, was he good?  Yeah, Ashley was.  He better damn well be, because now you are out.  What do you mean, I'm out?  You can go live with him after he gets a divorce.  Well, fuck it.  Then I will.  Yeah, you will.  This is bullshit.  Ashley, I did not raise you like this.  What happened to college?  Are you going to still go?  Are you going to still have a life, or are you going to just hook up with some old man 
[02:22:00]  and live off of him for the rest of your freaking life?  He makes good money.  Well, you know what?  You're smarter than that, and you're being a complete moron right now.  Complete moron.  And this is the something cute you had to tell me.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Oh, my God.  Calm down.  My blood pressure is shooting up faster than anything.  You know, you're going to put me in my fucking grave. 
[02:22:30]  I'm not that old, but I'm going to be going to my fucking grave soon.  Can I ask a question?  Uh-huh.  Not to be.  Ashley?  Yeah.  Was he a big boy?  Yeah.  Fucking Christ.  I hope it was worth it.  That's all I got to tell you.  It better fucking have done well done worth it.  Was he cut or uncut?  He's cut. 
[02:23:00]  What position did you enjoy?  Um, I was mostly on my back.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's great.  Eating dinner over your house.  Now he's eating somewhere else.  Oh, God.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  No.  Yeah, like I want to lose a husband.  Mm-hmm.  Why would you lose a husband?  Because he'll fucking kill him.  Why?  That's his best friend and his daughter. 
[02:23:30]  So what's the problem?  Wouldn't you want to fucking kill him?  I mean, right now, I'm like getting ready to go to his job and blow his fucking head off.  Oh, boy.  That'd be the second time in two days he's had that done.  I hear a kid in the background.  I enjoy my way, though.  Fucking little bitch.  So did you notice there was some flirting going on there, Mom?  No.  No?  And what's going on with the kid in the background?  I have babies that are crying.  And this is your oldest? 
[02:24:00]  That's my oldest.  Ashley's your oldest.  And I'm hoping, you know what?  He's never allowed in this fucking house again.  Because how is he going to go after my 12-year-old?  Is he going to go after my fucking 2-year-old now?  Well, maybe he'll go after your brother.  You got a little farm there for him.  Yeah, it's like the Expos of pedophiles.  So what are you going to do to keep from raising another slut?  Fucking lock him up.  You home after school.  And then you just come home after school. 
[02:24:30]  Could you quiet that baby the same way they quieted the baby at the end of Caligula?  Oh, my God.  Last episode of M.A.S.H.  I'm just going to come home and we'll talk.  You can't come home.  Wouldn't be quiet.  I've been up all night.  Not only with the baby, but walk in the fucking halls, waiting for your ass to come in this door.  Well, she was getting laid.  And you're out.  You know something?  I wouldn't believe this unless it was some shithole in Pennsylvania that they were coming from. 
[02:25:00]  The fact that it's Hazleton.  I know.  It's totally, I believe this could happen there.  Yeah.  All right, Ashley.  Anything else you want to say to your mom?  No, but I want to play with my pants.  Oh, you've got to go.  You know what?  Your bags will be at the fucking steps when you get home.  Your mom's heartbroken.  I did not raise my child to do stuff like this.  Oh, boy. 
[02:25:30]  We might live in a town where fucking people walk around and do shit that God only knows what.  But I raised you better than that.  Apparently not.  Mom, would you play a game of mother-daughter once in my pants?  Jimmy.  Not a bad idea.  Why not?  All right, well.  She's upset.  Well, it looks like you guys got some things to work out there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I'll come home and we'll talk.  Oh, yeah.  Come home.  Yeah, we'll talk.  How many times did you guys have sex last night, Ashley? 
[02:26:00]  Four.  Yeah, we're going to talk.  Four?  About four.  About four times.  Not bad.  Not bad for the old guy.  Did he rub his helmet on your brown eye?  Yeah.  Did he try anything, like, freaky?  No, no.  Like the whole situation isn't freaky enough.  No, he was nice about it.  Yeah, he was a real gentleman.  And does he like you?  I think.  All right.  Janice, you all right? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She's just reflecting, looking at her other children, thinking, you know, who's next?  Yeah.  You're not necessarily going to fail with the other ones, too.  Oh, I cry.  What?  I don't want to cry.  You just basically told me that everything that we've been living and everything, I thought  we could trust these people, and apparently we can't.  I've known them for that long, and this is the way they're going to be. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, I'm sure she's upset she can't get the image  out of her head of this guy just on top of her little girl, you know, pounding away.  And that's an image that will probably stick with her for quite a while.  Both of them just naked.  Yeah, and your descriptions are so helpful.  Get that image out of her head.  Sorry, I was just trying to convey that, you know, it's probably very upsetting to you.  All the trust, the holidays spent together.  Oh.  Her little teenage body just wanting and wanting.  And a couple of years ago, you remember her like, you know, the little girl. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  And now all of a sudden she's a young woman, and this guy that you've entrusted is just  ravaging her in a hotel room.  Yeah.  Just fouling your daughter over and over again.  Now you're running back through your mind thinking of all the times he was over that you  might have thought he was looking at her a little weird.  Oh.  When she was 13, maybe.  Yeah.  Now I'm worried that he's looking at my other children.  Well, then dress him better.  All right, Ashley, any final thoughts there? 
[02:28:00]  No, I'll be home and we can talk about it then.  Yeah, you need to come home so we can talk about it.  Yeah, and you need to come home, like, soon, okay?  Yeah.  Mommy's not mad at you.  Not at all.  Oh, boy.  Ashley, where are you now?  I'm at the hotel.  Which hotel?  The one right down the street or by the mall?  The one by the mall?  The one by the mall.  Okay, why don't you just wait there and I'll come get you. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, boy.  Ashley, are you attractive?  She's a beautiful girl.  Does she have email?  Oh.  Jimmy.  All right, Ashley.  Janice, thank you.  Oh.  I didn't know this was going to happen today.  Ashley said she just wanted to tell you something on the show today.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was going to be this.  But we told you there was a prize attached.  And you actually win Dr. Spock's book on how to be a better parent. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, I should have used it 19 years ago.  Right across her ass.  Either that or a hanger.  Yeah.  Or how to choose better, Frit.  Are you going to come pick me up for what?  Yeah, I'm coming to get you.  All right.  All right, we're going to need an update on this story.  So why don't you guys call us tomorrow or Thursday or something, all right?  Oh, you want to put Ashley on hold because Eric wants her number.  We're going to put Ashley on hold.  And Janice, we're going to put you on hold, all right? 
[02:29:30]  Okay.  We're putting you both on hold.  All right.  Put.  Shut up.  All right.  Thanks, Janice.  Oh, you're welcome.  And there they go.  Oh, that was good.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I mean, I don't know what to make of that story.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  I have a full rod.  He is all like.  How does he get a rod from that one?  Janice?  Just hearing mommy's tears.  Janice?  Yes?  Jim has a full rod after listening to this story.  I'm not some 38-year-old creep, though. 
[02:30:00]  He's 35.  36.  36.  36-year-old creep.  And he was very turned on by your daughter's story.  How are you going to confront this guy?  No.  Oh, I don't even know.  I say just tell his fucking wife and let her freaking deal with him.  All right.  Why don't we call the wife?  Hey, do you have her number?  You want to call the wife?  Oh, I would never do that to Lisa.  I'd never do anything like that.  Why don't you call Fred?  You don't have to do it to Lisa.  Why don't you call Fred?  Oh, that's a good one.  He's at work right now.  Exactly.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Let's confront Fred at work. 
[02:30:30]  Why not?  The way he used your trust just to get your little, you know, meet me down the street at the hotel.  All right.  Take care, parents.  Meet me down the street at the hotel.  You know what he must have been thinking when he saw that 18-year-old ass?  Yeah.  The 19-year-old ass for the first time?  Yeah, newly turned 19-year-old.  Just turned 19.  Phone rings once for the signal.  She meets him outside by the sycamore tree.  All right.  We've got to put you on hold.  Okay.  We're going to get your number. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, possibly.  But let's take a break first, all right?  Now available on Norton Records, a heartwarming compilation.  A tribute to the mentally disadvantaged.  It's Jim Norton duet.  Straight from the O.P. and Anthony show, it's Jim Norton.  A preschooler's keyboard and a room full of retards.  Singing some of television's greatest hits. 
[02:31:30]  Mr. We could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, did he sure ran that one into the ground?  That would be a promo.  There's a health concern that's kind of fallen by the wayside.  It was big news a while ago, but it's still always present.  And that's the possibility that there may be a smallpox epidemic in this country.  Unbelievable. 
[02:32:00]  Unbelievable.  A smallpox epidemic.  How could that be possible?  And the reason is because the smallpox vaccine that we were given and that I was told was going to last forever wore off.  And our government waited until a possible emergency condition to inform us.  Now that's a crackerjack group of fuckers, isn't it?  How could you fucking not call us? 
[02:32:30]  Hey, Lou, your smallpox vaccine wore off.  You want another?  You fucking wait!  I want another!  Because my whole life has been a delusion.  Because every day I'd wake up and I'd go, you know, it's going to suck today.  But at least I'm not getting smallpox!  To wait as long as the federal government waited to tell us about this, it's as if you went to a public bathroom and you flushed the toilet and the toilet water just hit you in the face. 
[02:33:00]  And then as you walked out of the bathroom, on the door was a big sign, warning, toilet water may hit you in the face.  If I get smallpox, I'll file suit against the federal government because they took me out of a very important class to get that vaccine.  And if I'd taken that class, I wouldn't have to do this bullshit for a living. 
[02:33:30]  I'd have a real job like with WorldCom or Enron or Tyco or Global Crossing.  Or Adelphia.  Just when you had time to take a breather, XM Satellite Radio brings you right off the bench.  Get that weak stuff out of here!  You hear that sound?  It's time to take off the warm-ups. 
[02:34:00]  College Basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  We have ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-10.  Round ball, baby!  It'll be a full slate on channels 180 through 188.  Huge rivalries.  ACC, North Carolina, and Duke.  Yeah, hills!  Yeah, hills!  Blue, yellow!  Blue, yellow!  Arizona, UCLA.  Go Cats!  Go Cats!  Yeah, Bruins!  Yeah, Bruins!  Indiana, and Purdue.  Who's yours?  Who's yours?  Boilermakers, Boilermakers, Boilermakers!  Oh, yeah, and we have much more.  All season long, we're taking it hard to the hoop. 
[02:34:30]  The defensive pressure continues.  That was a...  With College Basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the ACC, Big Ten, and the Pac-10.  College Basketball on channels 180 through 188.  On XM Satellite Radio.  No one will outscore us.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything.  All the time.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Open up, fuck up, and let that behind me.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Controversy has broken out on the O&A show. 
[02:35:30]  Ashley was on the line about 15 minutes ago claiming that she slept with her father's best friend.  She wanted to tell her mom.  We got the mom on the phone.  And very awkward phone call to listen to.  But we got to be honest, half the listeners are completely buying it, and the other half are not buying it whatsoever.  We're divided in here, too.  Yeah, we're kind of on the fence in here.  I don't know.  You know, I'd kind of, I'd love to think it's real.  Yeah.  I sure would. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  But I don't know.  We still have Ashley on the line, and we're going to try to get to the bottom of this.  She can't hear us right now.  And we're going to make believe, like, you know, where someone from the legal department or something from XM Saturday Radio wants to get to the bottom of this.  Okay?  Yeah.  So why don't we get her?  Yeah.  Okay.  Ashley?  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Chuck Schick from XM Legal.  Hey.  How are you doing?  We need to fill out some forms regarding the content of your conversation on the air. 
[02:36:30]  Okay.  And we absolutely need to know if it was true or false, because there could be legal ramifications for the program.  So we, it's not for the air.  We just want to know if this really did happen or not.  It's fine either way.  Yeah.  So you're saying this absolutely did happen.  It's happened. 
[02:37:00]  Okay.  And you were telling your mom for the first time.  Yeah.  Okay.  Check that.  Because, you know, we don't want to be sued.  No, I'm...  This side, you know.  So if it's true, we will then write down that it is indeed true.  And if not, that's fine too.  But you're saying this absolutely did happen and your confrontation with your mother was absolutely legitimate. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much.  Okay, thanks.  And please hold.  Janice?  Yeah?  There's your confirmation.  That's real.  You shameless hustler.  Okay.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  Right.  Lou, Mary.  Oh, Mary had sex with Lou.  Mary and Lou.  The Ted Knight sounds.  Oh, Mary.  Oh.  Marie.  Mary had sex with Lou. 
[02:38:00]  All the trust that we put in Lou.  He slept with Mary.  Jesus.  Well.  Ashley, you need to be in the lobby in 15 minutes because I will be there for you.  Okay.  Just tell her there's a 38-year-old cock waiting for her and I'm sure she'll be right there.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that this is actually true.  I can't believe this.  You guys got some talking to do.  Some healing. 
[02:38:30]  And you know what, Janice?  And if you need it, we do have Jerry Springer's number.  If that'll help you guys.  I'll say I'm sorry to hear that it's true, but then there's a part of me that's glad it  is because I'd hate to think I got a fat boner for nothing.  All right, Janice, any final thoughts?  Because we have to move on.  Take care of yourselves and each other.  That's right.  All right?  Okay.  All right, we're going to let them be.  Wait, Janice?  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  Two yeses.  Two yeses and you hang up on her.  Wow.  All right.  Beat it.  Where's Eric?  Eric said when he picked up the phone, the mom was like in tears and stuff, so.  Eric could hear the sniffling and the huffing.  She's like, you're just fat.  Now I'm buying it.  Now I'm definitely buying it.  All right, Ben.  Ben just spilt his coffee.  Oh, Jesus, dude.  Do you have to have a large all over the console?  Could you at least, hold on here.  Dude, that's equipment.  Get the. 
[02:39:30]  And what are you doing?  I know.  You got the remote in it.  It's the remote.  Oh.  Ben's just panicking.  He's not putting it down.  He's just looking at the spill.  You fucking bitch.  He spilled the coffee.  Master Poe has entered the studio, Anthony.  Oh, Master Poe.  Yes, Master Poe has entered the studio.  Is he going to help clean up?  You're the rest of the world.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  Look at him with his karate fast hands.  He ripped off the paper towel.  And Sensei is sopping up the coffee. 
[02:40:00]  He's wiping on and wiping off.  He's wiping coffee off the console.  No, up, down.  Make a circle.  Make a circle.  You can bring the guy from Hustler in.  He put two brushes on his hands and started chopping Ben's hair.  We have to say hi to Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Or was it Dom Morena?  Hey, Dom.  It's Dar Ferrer.  Our stupid producer mispronounced your name, so we've been calling you Dom Morena all morning long. 
[02:40:30]  I kind of like that.  It's almost Latino.  I have a lot bigger followers.  Yeah.  Well, um.  But what did I miss?  Some 18-year-old girl admitted she slept with her father's friend.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we weren't buying it at first, but now we're definitely buying it.  Why can't I meet kids like this?  She decides that she needs to tell her mom, so we decide, why don't you tell her on the air?  Yeah.  And it got a little ugly.  Basically, she slept with her father's best friend, yes.  Oh.  Wow.  You raise a kid just so your friend can have sex with her. 
[02:41:00]  I always love when people admit the stuff on the air, like a nice, intimate surrounding.  I know.  I don't know.  Why do people do that?  Why do they do that, like on Oprah and stuff?  Jerry Springer and, well, the Jerry Springer stuff.  That's bullshit, yeah.  Yeah, that's all fake.  But they do.  They come on the other shows and just admit things.  Why don't they just go into a nice room with their loved one and admit it there?  I don't blame the guy for liking a younger chick.  I like younger chicks.  So what?  Of course.  That's what always kills me about, you know, when people say to me, you know, why do you 
[02:41:30]  go out with a girl that young?  I go, because I can.  What am I going to go, you know, I'm going to go out with my grandmother?  Something like somebody as old as me?  You know what I mean?  Come on, give it up, you old bag.  I see.  There's plenty of time when you get older to be with an older woman.  Yep.  So when you're, you know, when you're middle-aged, I guess.  What did she look like, this girl?  We don't know.  She sounded hot.  We didn't really ask.  She seemed like a typical 19-year-old. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, I love that.  That you would find in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.  And the mother's raising another two so best friends can have sex with them.  Dom, did you ever date a younger girl?  Oh, yeah, yeah, always.  I mean, my girlfriend's 20 years younger than me.  Really?  Well, so was the one.  I broke up.  I was married, and I was going out with, like, this 18-year-old girl.  As a matter of fact, her father was my best friend.  No, but I did for a while, and I cheated on my wife.  And that really, that was like a year. 
[02:42:30]  That's not worth the energy.  Wait, you were married, and you cheated with a younger woman?  Yeah, for a year.  You cheated for a year?  How did you pull that off?  I don't know.  I was just out of my fucking mind.  I was, like, going to Vegas with her.  I looked like one of those, like, goombas with the big blonde with the big tits, you  know.  With the chippy at your side?  Yeah, yeah.  Like the arm piece thing.  I mean, I'm still friends with her, but she got too old for me.  I asked you that question, because Dom is the author of one of my favorite jokes ever.  That was my awful setup, but it's like, I saw him, I saw you on stage one time, and 
[02:43:00]  you're like, I dated a girl so young, I dated a girl who was so young, I didn't see her  for a while, she got taller.  One of the greatest jokes ever written.  Her favorite food is pistachio.  Just kidding.  Oh, that was really good.  Oh, wow.  Watching that child molestation shit.  But did you hear me almost butcher that brilliant joke?  I know, you were teetering there for a while, Jim. 
[02:43:30]  Damn it, I was nervous.  I was ruined his joke.  No, no.  Hey, man, did you guys get my setup so that you could ask me so I could knock him out of  the park?  We got nothing.  We didn't even have your name right.  With my rental car bit and all that shit.  Now, we were talking about that, I was talking to your producer last night, he said, you know,  what do you want to talk about?  I said, well, the one thing I don't want to do is fucking material in the sense of acting  like it's not material. 
[02:44:00]  You know what I mean?  Oh, we love those setups.  Hey, you know, been on vacation?  Because I know renting those cars is just a bitch.  It's funny you should ask.  Now, here's five brilliant minutes off the top of my head.  Yeah, because I'm the king of riffing.  Oh, that's funny.  But I just want to do tell you the child molestation bit that Jim was referring to because it's  interesting how you can get away with shit if you pull it back on yourself.  But basically, it is child molestation is a horrible, hideous thing, but there's a flip  side to everything.  What about the kids like me who wanted to be molested and nobody would touch? 
[02:44:30]  Remember, my grandmother would be giving me a band and say, you know, I'm just tickling  my balls very lightly, cup them, guess the way, let me see your tits, I'll give you a  dollar.  But the thing about that is the only way you can get an audience on your side, you've got  to bring it back.  You know what I mean?  You can't be like, you know, like the fingy of your daughter.  Right, right, right.  Right.  Behind closed doors, perhaps that works.  Yes.  On the radio, it works if you're a daughter telling mommy.  So how did the wife find out about the young chippy? 
[02:45:00]  Her panties.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  She left her panties in one of the drawers.  I mean, it was a setup.  Yeah, she did it on purpose, right?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  She said she didn't.  Were you telling her, don't worry, I'm going to leave my wife?  Oh, yeah.  And then a year goes by and she's like, fuck this, I'm going with the panties.  And your wife finds, like, underwear with Wonder Woman on them?  Right, right.  Underroos.  Underroos?  The hell is this?  Yeah, that was horrible, though.  It's not worth it. 
[02:45:30]  I mean, it's just worth it.  It's better, as you know, just to get a hooker.  Yeah, right.  It's not worth the energy of all that.  You know what kind of alibis you've got to come up with for a year and the things you've  got to keep track of?  Oh, man, I don't know how I did it.  I don't know how I covered it for myself.  Like, I just got caught with an internet thing with this girl from San Francisco.  My girlfriend just caught me now.  I can't stop them.  So that's my only fucking addiction.  I could give up drinking or anything else.  But this, and she says, so I made up this whole story about it totally just, I was just 
[02:46:00]  trying to practice using a computer and the internet and all that.  And I got away with that.  How'd you get caught?  She looked into, I'm so fucking stupid.  I gave her my email.  Oh, Jesus.  I know.  No, you know, I gave it to her because she had to look up a ticket of hers that I had  bought for her.  And I totally forgot that they weren't all erased.  And she's paranoid enough.  Well, she's smart enough to go back and check it all out.  That's how I got caught.  You got to watch even on Instant Messenger because there are programs that can track all 
[02:46:30]  of the dialogue you've had on Instant Messenger.  Yeah.  So you even got to watch what you say in those little IMs because the chick knows the computer.  All of a sudden there's a stack of printouts of things you said 12 months ago.  So I am the worst at cheating.  Always happens.  Everyone's running to their computers right now thanks to Tom.  Dump it.  Dump your files.  Right.  I'm the worst cheater in the world because I don't care.  I don't even care.  Like, I will move on and not look back. 
[02:47:00]  So I don't even try to be subtle about it or anything.  So I'm the easiest one to catch.  I just go, yeah, well, I'm cheating.  Goodbye.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't even try.  I leave things out.  It's awful.  That's a good way to get out of a relationship.  It's pretty much it, you know, because why do I want to bother?  If you found somebody else, why do you want to bother hanging on to something you really  was annoying you?  I don't know.  I much like the drama because you're right.  If you really care that much, you wouldn't even do it. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  People like playing Mannix.  You know, you like being the guy that's got to get the evidence, make sure it's set up  correctly.  You don't want the other party to catch on.  It's too much work.  There's something nice about sneaking around, though.  There's something hot about just knowing that it's dirty and wrong.  Really?  Yeah, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  Well, if you put it out, yeah, if you have everything on the surface, then it's not nearly  as much fun.  Yeah, but I mean, it is too much stress.  Too much, I can't, like, this whole fucking thing is hard enough traveling and resisting. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, like, you can get chicks that, I could get girls right now, it's the fattest  I've ever been, the ugliest I've ever been.  I can get girls hotter than ever just because of my little bullshit comedy act.  Yeah.  Which is amazing.  Yeah, look at Jimmy Norton.  Look at Norton.  Dude, the last time I saw Rara, I don't know what girl it was, if you were dating her,  if she was your wife or your girlfriend, but I've never seen you with any girl who wasn't  smoking hot.  It's fucking amazing.  Oh, the Montreal Comedy Festival, you were walking around with someone really hot.  Holy shit.  That's my girlfriend, that one. 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  She's in bed now.  I don't know whether to go deep sea fishing or go back to bed and play with her ass and jerk  off.  I can't decide.  Help me out with this, guys.  We can flip a coin for you.  Anyone have a coin?  You know, we have couples have sex on our show.  Maybe this could be the first celebrity having sex on our show.  Now, whatever happened to Mercurio?  Who?  Who?  What?  Oh, nothing.  Never mind.  I had some kind of a thought.  I had to know it.  What?  Who's he? 
[02:49:00]  That's Jim's boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should hear what he says about him when the mics are off, that brave Jimmy Norton.  I just won't mention his name.  All right.  Where are you working, Don?  I'm at Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Of course.  Friday and Saturday.  It's always funny.  No matter how much you try and be as good as you can at something, you have to say you're  working at Bananas.  Bananas.  I couldn't name it the Poughkeepsie.  Is there anything wrong with the Poughkeepsie Comedy Club? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  It's not wacky and zany enough.  Yeah.  Already, Poughkeepsie's funny enough, but you've got to be Poughkeepsie Bananas.  People getting ready to go out are just sitting there going, wow, I'm going to Bananas  tonight.  It's got to be fun.  The place is called Bananas.  I mean, is there a funnier fruit than Bananas?  No.  It's bent.  It's yellow.  It feels wacky.  You can use it in a rape.  And then eat it. 
[02:50:00]  There you go.  That's funny.  That is funny.  That's a great club, man.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie is phenomenal.  Yeah.  I love those clubs.  I mean, you know, to me, it's like so much, I just like not having anybody tell me what  to say or do.  That's why you guys must be having fun on satellite.  Yeah.  It's a lot more fun than regular radio.  That's for sure.  You get tired of the bullshit of people editing you.  And that's what I love about stand-up.  It's like, you know, it's just, don't leave me alone, you know?  We're going to call it Bananas Radio, I think. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  I like that.  It makes it funnier.  I like the ring.  But the problem with Bananas is the symbol is actually a smiling banana.  It's a banana, like a smiley face on it.  Unless they've got this cheap, like, wooden chimp with paint chipping off it that's been  around so long.  That's behind you.  So no matter how far in life you go, you're still at Bananas.  You're sure that's not the bouncer?  We have to always think about, like, certain comedy acts, you know, like, you know, Judy 
[02:51:00]  Tenuto.  Yeah.  Or like Harry Bazin, if you remember him.  But he was like a prop act.  And I said to Harry, you know, like, because he has to pick up his props after the show.  I said, no matter what I do, hopefully I walk away with a little dignity.  He said, you can have the greatest show of your life and you're still picking up your  plastic ass and your Superman cape and your cow that goes over the moon, you know.  That's pretty bad.  Hey, is he the guy that used to open for Rodney?  Yeah.  I have seen him. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I did.  I was, I got a spot at Rodney's funeral.  It was like a gig.  We did the eulogy, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, it was a lot of fun as far as, like, you know, nostalgically looking back  on this legendary guy.  And he was really good to a bunch of us that were at the funeral.  And I loved the guy.  But Tim Allen, you ready for this?  He bumped.  He, like, asked for a spot, like he was doing a gig at the improv.  Oh, man.  He wasn't even on the thing. 
[02:52:00]  And, you know, it was just so weird.  I would never think of doing that.  I said that.  Adam Sandler says, are you going up?  He goes, no, man, I'll choke you guys.  Do it.  It's like, you know, who wants to do a eulogy?  Here he is asking to do it.  Then he gets up and he says, we're not on the air now, right?  No.  Okay.  He gets over and he goes, well, you know, Rodney taught me a big lesson.  He said he took me out of his special one time.  You know, he hired me and then fired me.  He says, you know, I realized Rodney was talking about his wife and doctors.  And I was talking about tools and cars. 
[02:52:30]  And I guess you see where that got me.  It's like, what the fuck is this?  It's like, you know, your time for catharsis?  It's a funeral.  He's like, what is he getting back at Rodney?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like bizarre.  It's kind of a weird place to be getting back at Rodney.  He'd be vindicated in front of his weeping fucking relatives.  What an ass.  Do another Christmas movie.  And then Leno gets up.  Leno gets up and he slams Bob Saget.  You know, because Leno can't have not one ounce of sincerity in his body.  And he goes, he says, yeah, Bob, it's good to see you're working again. 
[02:53:00]  And I was like, fuck it.  It's like Saget was crying.  People are crying.  The guy's dead.  It's a funeral.  He's doing like a roast.  Well, that is weird.  That is very strange.  Wow.  Like a gig.  Did you go up and talk at all or no?  Yeah, I did.  And I just said, I mean, I did a couple of stories about him because I loved the fact  that he was so nuts, you know?  Like even when he was 80.  He was 80 years old. 
[02:53:30]  I went to his birthday and he goes, hey, kid, you want to get fucked up?  And I go, Rodney, I don't smoke pot.  He goes, all right, I'll see you in 10 minutes then.  He was like this old kind of jazz musician.  We used to get him high on our show.  He used to come in and we used to get him high all the time.  Oh, yeah.  He was getting high.  He was like you said, in his 80s, he'd come to do our show and during the commercial breaks,  he'd go get high with Stinky.  Yeah, he was doing coke in his 70s.  I told him he had a stroke.  I said, Rodney, man, be careful. 
[02:54:00]  He goes, oh, it's just a mini stroke.  I ain't no pussy.  It's not going to ruin my day.  What, this one arm not working?  Fuck that.  He was the real deal.  Yeah, he was a character.  Very cool.  Well, Dom.  I always like to end my bit with a sad moment.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  A funeral story.  When are you working at Bananas?  Is this Friday, Saturday?  Yeah, it's this Friday and Saturday.  And you're going to come in and see us soon?  I hope so, man.  Thanks.  Yeah, we'd love to have you in, all right? 
[02:54:30]  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you, Dom.  Talk to you later.  Good luck with it, guys.  See you later, man.  Have a good show.  Very cool.  Very funny.  Well, funny as I'm alive.  Dom Turbo Carrera, as Ben would say.  Dom Herrera.  Always a tough name to say, actually.  The last name thing went nowhere?  What?  No.  It went there.  Because I was trying to remember the name he actually...  What did you say?  Dom what?  Dom Marina.  Dom Marina.  Dom Marina.  Dom Marina.  It's Dom Marrera.  Dom Moranis? 
[02:55:00]  Which is a...  Dom Marina?  Just a tough name to say.  Dom Marrera?  Not at all.  Dom Marrera.  Dom Marrera.  It's a consonant and then a vowel with a little consonant.  Dom Marrera.  It flows.  All right.  It rolls off your tongue.  In honor of Dom getting caught cheating on the internet, oh, play a little internet  song here.  Mm-hmm.  And we'll continue.  Finally, I get to teach a whole lesson all by myself.  And I'm going to teach something relevant.  Something modern.  The internet.  The internet is really, really great. 
[02:55:30]  For porn.  I've got a fast connection so I don't have to wait.  For porn.  What?  There's always some new sight.  For porn.  I browse all day and night.  For porn.  It's like I'm surfing at the speed of light.  For porn.  Trekkie.  The internet is for porn.  Trekkie.  The internet is for porn.  What are you doing?  Why you think the net was born?  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Trekkie.  Oh, hello, Kid Monster. 
[02:56:00]  You are ruining my song.  Oh, me sorry.  Me no mean to.  Well, if you wouldn't mind please being quiet for a minute so I can finish.  Okie dokie.  Good.  I'm glad we have this new technology.  For porn.  Oh.  Which gives us untold opportunity.  For porn.  Oh, sorry.  From your own desktop.  For.  You can research, browse, and shop until you've had enough and you're ready to stop. 
[02:56:30]  For porn.  Trekkie.  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  Trekkie.  Hit me up all night hugging me.  Horns do porn.  Porn.  Porn.  That's gross.  You're a pervert.  Ah, sticks and stones, Kate Monster.  No, really.  You're a pervert.  Normal people don't sit at home and look at porn on the internet.  Oh.  What?  You have no idea. 
[02:57:00]  Ready, normal people?  Ready.  Ready.  Ready.  Let me hear it.  The internet is for porn.  Sorry, Kate.  The internet is for porn.  I masturbate.  All these guys unzip their flies for porn.  Porn.  The internet is not for porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Hold on a second.  Wow.  Now, I happen to know for a fact that you, Rod, check your portfolio and trade stocks online.  That's correct.  And, Brian, you buy things on Amazon.com. 
[02:57:30]  Sure.  And, Gary, you keep selling your possessions on eBay.  Yes, I do.  And, Princeton, you sent me that sweet online birthday card.  True.  Oh, but, Kate, what you think he do after?  Shut up.  How long does this go on?  The internet is for porn.  Right.  The internet is for porn.  I hate porn.  Grab your dick and double click for porn.  Porn.  Porn.  I hate porn. 
[02:58:00]  Porn.  Come on, everybody.  Porn.  I hate the internet.  Porn.  The internet is for internet is for internet is for internet is for porn.  Awful.  Yeah.  What's wrong, guys?  It's like the type of thing you hear at the end of a Kentucky Fried movie.  What happened?  Oh, was that playing the whole time to turn it off?  Yeah.  What a jerk off I am talking over it clumsily.  I didn't hear it.  That's all right.  It wasn't up loud enough.  Sex Bagel said it's a cute little song about internet porn. 
[02:58:30]  I said, all right.  I trust your judgment.  I have to take a leak.  So I started the song and I come back in five minutes later.  The song's still playing and you guys are screaming and yelling.  Well, the beginning is kind of funny when she's singing and then all of a sudden the voice comes in.  Right.  But then it goes on and on.  I felt like I was in one of those 3D shows at Disney.  The little Muppet thing in 3D.  It's just like it keeps going and going and going.  The internet is for porn.  All right.  We heard you.  We get it.  It's endless.  I didn't know.  They said it would be a good little filler.  How long was it? 
[02:59:00]  So we can take a leak.  It was about like six minutes.  It was about four minutes long.  Oh, jeez.  Four minutes is death.  I had to take a long leak.  All right.  Now we'll take a real break and then we'll...  The internet is for porn.  That's going to run through my fucking awful head all day.  The internet is for porn.  In the middle of the night you're going to hear that as you're trying to sleep.  As I'm laying there wide awake like a cave animal again.  It'll be like Karma Chameleon.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  At least that was a good song.  We'll do that bit again.  All right.  So what...  Really, Jim?  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  It's no Sabbath, though.  No, you're right.  It's not.  But I still like it.  I have varied music taste.  So what do we got going for the rest of the show?  Jonathan Gold after the break there.  Talking about 9-11.  Okay.  If you want to take the break.  And then we got the Jaeger guys are here.  Steve's going to start doing Shots of Jaeger.  Are you going to do Shots of Jaeger today?  Why not?  No.  No.  Too early.  Martini Jaeger, Steve.  Okay.  Very early in the morning.  All right.  We got lots of show to still do here.  Oh.  Oh.  Nailed.  That was ugly.  Nailed.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:00:00]  No.  Oh, God.  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  Folks, it's important to remember the old days of the Yiddish theater. 
[03:00:30]  That's right.  This very Bowery Ballroom was a Yiddish theater years ago.  And right now, I want everybody to remember that no matter what you do in life, no one  is more important than your mama.  For those of you who love Yiddish theater, perhaps like us, you'll recognize this tune  that we humbly offer.  So you saw some tale in the fat man's yard. 
[03:01:00]  She's kind of old, but you were already hard.  You jumped the fence, and you're ready to go.  But there's one thing I'd like you to know.  Hey, mister, that's my mama, you're stupid. 
[03:01:30]  Thank you very much.  Enter her gently, for her hair pie is drooping.  Show her respect, as you cream in her goosh.  Remember, I sprang out of that goosh.  Thanks, mister. 
[03:02:00]  To you, she's a calm dumpster, but that skanky old howl.  She raised our whole litter, cause that wasn't around.  Gasshole.  I was the ninth pup, yes, I was the runt.  She had only eight nipples, so I went for her.  You know what I'm saying.  I'm not going to say it again.  Out of respect for mama. 
[03:02:30]  But what we had, was about more than mere nourishment.  So maybe, let her see you.  Just once, from the front.  Please be kind, as you break your cock off, and mom's behind.  Have control, don't pop out and get it into mom's wrong hole. 
[03:03:00]  While inside, think about my mama's pride.  How she beamed with joy at my very first poop.  And then she ate it.  She ate it.  She ate it.  Yes.  Hey, mister.  She ate it. 
[03:03:30]  She's up with Kiska, but it's flat  Gaza  Mama  Mama  Mama 
[03:04:00]  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings  Forget me not, you sightless twat, your dog just shit on my rug 
[03:04:30]  Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show  You don't do sketches, stupid!  What a bitch!  Just a kiss on her lips  Said I was on my knees  I'm waiting  Get me  What a bitch!  She was shaking her hips  So that was all that I needed  That's a better song than the internet is for porn  The internet is for porn 
[03:05:00]  Take out your dick!  Click, click, click  The internet is for porn  Well, that was a sex bagel pick  Yeah, that was a good one  Where is Eric in his straight sweater?  Eric is running into the studio as we speak here  Yeah, sex bagel  Awful grunge sweater  There he is  That song was  That was a big Kev suggestion  He gave us the CD  When?  Really?  He's calling in to say  He's like, wow, that's really brave  I'm like, Kevin, you gave me the song 
[03:05:30]  It was kind of  Big Kev  Liar!  You gave that song to Sex Bagel?  I did not  I played it for him in my car one  I did not suggest he use it for the show  You rat bastard  Sell me out the river  Why would you play that song for him in the car?  He did  Why though?  Because I was playing the sound  You know what that song is from?  Did he tell you that?  Avenue Q  Correct  Yeah  Aha  I happened to be going to see that show 
[03:06:00]  I got the soundtrack  There were some tracks on it  I thought were very funny  But it's a little  I didn't say they were funny for the show  I said they were funny  Funny is  If it's funny, then it's funny for the show  How could there be two different columns of funny?  Okay  Because the Tony Danza audience laughs at all sorts of shit that's funny  That would be funny for the show, right?  Yeah, but you have the same sense of humor that we do  Like the Danza audience is different  You think like we think  I've been in the car with you  I can picture you popping that in  But I can't picture you going  Shhh shhh 
[03:06:30]  The internet for porn song is coming on  Here's my favorite lyric right here  Right  Because that's so me  That's what I'm saying  It's not like you  That's what I'm saying  So now Sex Bagel  Yeah  You listen to this  And then you made the assumption that this would be good  You made the executive decision to bring it to Ant and I's attention  Right  And I must say  When it was played earlier  I heard the beginning of it  And as the woman is singing the part  I'm like what the hell is this crap?  And then all of a sudden the guy voice jumps in  The internet is for porn 
[03:07:00]  Because he just jumps in with porn  And it was kind of surprising  And gave me a chuckle  Right  But then to put on the entire song is what they call ponderous  Well I figured it would be good filler  Much too long  Much too long  Well we're going to just take that bit of the old guy  The guy  And then when we have internet stories we'll play that  Can I ask a more important question?  This is an important question  Which is not really going to translate into radio  But why does Eric have a blood stain in the front of his pants?  On his zipper?  Yeah, what is that?  I have no idea 
[03:07:30]  He has on tan slacks and right by his zipper there's a coppery blood stain  Are you bleeding from the penis?  Yeah, it's my time  It's great  That should happen to you for playing that song  It brings back another OP memory  What is that?  I have no idea  Well someone was saying  Is this true that Master Poe threw out a bloody  Where is that note that someone wrote?  Who wrote the note about Master Poe throwing out some bloody clothes as he was coming to work today?  Derek  Are you kidding?  Yeah, I think one of the interns spotted Poe throwing something out 
[03:08:00]  And it was bloody?  Where's Derek?  Bloody clothing?  Our assigned killer?  That's a mystery  What did you see this morning, Derek?  What were you witness to?  No, it was like the top half of a karate uniform  It was just covered in blood  Oh my god  What the hell?  Where is this thing?  It's in the dumpster down 58th street  At the corner of 6th and 58th 
[03:08:30]  Who else is getting really creeped out?  Wow, what does that mean?  Yeah, so it was just  He just  And why would he throw it down there?  I don't know  Can we go get that?  You think they took it?  It's still there  It might not still be there  Holy jeez, what is that?  Does Master Poe want to explain?  Oh man  You want to ask him?  I don't know  Yeah, you want to ask?  A bloody karate uniform?  Wow  The dumpster is for bloody evidence  What are you guys doing? 
[03:09:00]  They're getting gloves  Getting gloves to take the out of the line  Yeah, for the wiffle ball bat  Well, if it's blood, you know  It's blood  It could be tainted blood  Tainted blood  Alright, Big Kev, thank you  See ya  See ya, sweetie  We're distracted now  We're onto something else  The dumpster for dumping the evidence works very well  Just ask that jerk-off that killed his wife  Dumped everything in a dumpster  Dumped everything in a dumpster  There he goes  Here comes Master Poe into the studio  Oh, here he comes  Here he comes, Master Poe  You're the best  Or loud 
[03:09:30]  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down  You're the best  Or loud  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down  You're the best  Or loud  Well, Master Poe  He doesn't look happy  Master Poe  Sensei  What uh  I can't even look at him  We hear tell  Yeah  Somebody spied you this morning  Uh  Getting rid of  A blood-stained  Uh oh  A blood-stained  What was described as a karate uniform 
[03:10:00]  Uh  In a dumpster  Down at one of the corners  On the way in  Um  You don't have to if you don't want to  But  Got an explanation for this?  Well, let me start off by saying  Derek, it's real cold in the morning  And uh  I think from now on  You're gonna walk  Um  Wait, what was that about?  You pick him up every morning?  Every morning  Oh  I make sure that  He's in the car  And the heat is on  And he doesn't have to walk 25 blocks  Wow 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, that would be a cold-ass long walk  Mmm  Everyone is very uncomfortable right now  Are you having him wax the car  And then someday you'll give it to him?  You know, huh?  Would you like to hear the truth?  Uh  I'm not sure  If it makes me party to this, no  Does this  Does this have something to do with an 18 year old girl?  No  Alright, good  Okay, a boy?  No  Okay, uh 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, what happened?  My dog was injured yesterday  Oh  And unfortunately I was um  Taking care of him  I tried my best to  To take care of his wounds  And I had to bring him to the  To the vet  So I didn't have anything at hand  Is the dog okay right away?  Well, the dog is in the hospital right now  Is he gonna be okay?  He's gonna be fine  Oh, okay  Alright  Cause I hate when the story goes on  And at the end  There's the downer  And then, you know  We don't know how to react to the rest of the story  But now we're free to react to the rest of the story  Without worrying that the dog died at the end of the day 
[03:11:30]  Why don't you just say without worrying that we're gonna get our teeth kicked in?  Right  Cause if that was marrying or dying  We'd be like I hope your dog's dead  I know  But if him we're like  A little thing okay?  God bless  God bless  Hey, let me tell you  My heart's in praise  To your dog  Heart's in collars  Heart's collars  Heart's ringworm medicine  Out for anything  What I had to do is  I had to take off my jacket  Cause it was very cold last night  Yeah  Took off my jacket  I wrapped my dog in my jacket  And also the gi top  And unfortunately 
[03:12:00]  There was blood on the gi  On the gi  Yes  It was dog blood  Now what kind of injury did the dog have?  Um  He had a fight with another dog  Oh boy  Oh my god  Are you one of those guys?  No actually my dog  My dog is the kind of dog that watches television  Listens to the radio  XM radio  Right, right  He's not the kind of dog that you know  That fights?  No he's not that kind  The pit bulls that go at it  Right  The fighting dog  The fighting dogs?  No, no he's a great dog 
[03:12:30]  And right now he's in a lot of pain  What kind of dog did it get in a fight with?  Um  Husky slash pit bull  Combination of both  And the owner  Of this other dog?  Unknown  Unknown  Yeah  Of course I'm sure you'd have kicked his ass  No, no  I'm not about violence  Uh  However I just wanted to take care of my dog  And I was there until about 1.30 last night  Hmm  What a nice guy  And then the gi was a blood stain  So you decided to dump it in a dumpster  Well  Yes  All right 
[03:13:00]  Why not?  Not like that'll turn up somewhere  With somebody going  Holy shit, what was this all about?  Right  Should've just left it on the sidewalk  Yeah  For the reaction  Hmm  All right, how do we get out of this, Anthony?  Ah, thank you  Master Poe, everybody  Thank you, Justin  Thank you, gentlemen  And there he goes, Master Poe  Watch out  We're all breathing a sigh of relief  No kidding  No kidding  Not only do we like Master Poe  But we were afraid he'd murder every one of us to cover it up 
[03:13:30]  I know  I'm not even kidding you  I had this vision in my head  That he was just gonna just decide to take us all out  Cause we didn't know where that story was gonna go  No  And he was looking around the room  He was already sizing up who we'd go after first  You know what the worst part of the whole thing that I was thinking is?  Is because of the way the room is laid out  And the position of everybody  I would have to watch all of you die first  And I'd be the last one cowering in this corner in the back here  Watching you all get killed  And then have to, you know  Watch him come over 
[03:14:00]  And know how you would die?  He would throw you right out the window behind you  Oh, I would get flying right out  Five stories  Cracked head on 57  I just wanna watch Derek walk out there and talk to him now  Go, that was pretty funny what we did in there, right?  Sold him down the river  Takes his pinky and drives it through his voice box  Alright, why don't we say hi to Jonathan Gold  He's on Line 12  We have another fine guest to the radio program  Thanks to Ben  Hey, Jonathan, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Morning, Mr. Gold  What are you about?  I don't even know 
[03:14:30]  Oh, you're the 9-11 guy, right?  Yeah, I'm the 9-11 guy  You have a book  What do you got?  Well, first off, thanks for that internet porn song  I can't get it out of my fucking head  Yeah, it sticks there, doesn't it?  Yeah, nice song  What am I about?  The truth about 9-11  The truth  Now, as most people know, the truth is  A bunch of animals decided to get at the United States by loading themselves onto some planes  Taking them over and crashing into various symbolic buildings across the country  Exactly 
[03:15:00]  The official story states that 19 hijackers decided to take some planes and fly them into buildings  Now, your opinion of this is different than what everybody says?  Well, my opinion of the hijackers isn't necessarily different  However, I do believe that either our government allowed for these attacks or they purposefully planned them  Alright, Mulder  Mr. Gold, you sent some questions for us to possibly ask, so I'll kind of go through 
[03:15:30]  How did you get interested in the truth about 9-11?  Well, I've always had an inquisitive nature  Who cares?  And some things didn't add up  I mean  Ah, shut up  Just think about it  The Bush administration blocked the creation of the commission  No, they didn't  They appointed the commission themselves, which to me  So what? It means nothing, stupid  Or a murderer appointing his own jury  Wait, a murderer appointing his own jury?  Yeah, that's what it sounds like to me  I mean, that's essentially what it is 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, that would imply that George Bush and his administration did have responsibility for 9-11  Yeah, that's what I'm implying  Oh, you are  Yes  Okay  And can we read this in a book?  There are several  Absolutely, there are several  No, I mean books that you have written?  No, I was a contributor to the 9-11 omissions dossier, which was written by 911truth.org  You idiot, was Mohammed Atta behind the grassy knoll?  I didn't write a book 
[03:16:30]  I don't have the time for that  Now, let me ask you a question  What evidence do you have that kind of point?  Because I've been trying to find evidence about the Pentagon  Supposedly Flight 77 never hit the Pentagon  What evidence do you have or can you direct us to?  Okay, first off in regards to  You're a nut and a bore  Missiles hitting pentagons, remote controlled airplanes  I try to avoid all those things because they don't help me  To give you an understanding  What does help you?  Paxel?  There's a brutal film  Clearly showed that JFK was shot from the front 
[03:17:00]  I mean clearly showed that  JFK  JFK, yes  I'm sorry?  JFK?  Yeah, JFK  Just think about that  There's a brutal film  Clearly showed that he was shot from the front  You know, what has that done for us?  40 years later  We still don't know how to kill them  And the reason is because of magic bullet theories  Missiles hitting pentagons  Remote controlled airplanes  Those don't help me at all  I'd rather focus on the why it happened  As opposed to the how 
[03:17:30]  I mean the how is easy  They flew planes in the building  You sound like Donald Sutherland and JFK  You're a rip off and a tedious asshole  That's just important  Yeah  So what kind of evidence do you have that  Anybody else besides the hijackers  The hijackers and Al-Qaeda  Are responsible in any way  With what happened on September 11th?  Where's the hard evidence?  Alright, well let me do something for you  I'm going to give you  Free facts  And I want to see what you take of it 
[03:18:00]  Alright?  Alright  Fair enough, sir  Fair enough  Alright, in November 2000  The Pentagon was having drills  I don't care  Now this is November 2000  11 months before September 11th  They were having drills  That were referred to as  M-A-S-C-A-L  M-A-S-C-A-L  M-A-S-C-A-L?  Yes  M-A-S-C-A-L?  M-A-S-C-A-L  M-A-S-C-A-L  M-A-S-C-A-L  You can look it up  It's all over the internet  Those drills used models  Of the Pentagon  Actual models 
[03:18:30]  I saw  I've seen pictures of them  Yeah  The purpose of the drill  Was to plan a strategy  In the case of an emergency  Now  Isn't it  Kind of obvious  That of course  The Pentagon would be used  Because it would be a target  Right, exactly  So this is not anything  Huge or out of the ordinary  Right  Let me finish  Alright, finish  Fair enough, fair enough  One emergency was a plane  Flying into the Pentagon  Now this is November 2000  Obviously on September 11th, 2001  According to the official story 
[03:19:00]  A plane flew into the Pentagon  However, when Condoleezza Rice testified  Uh-huh  She said, and I quote  No one could have imagined them  Taking a plane  And slamming it into a Pentagon  Yeah, but she's black  You can't believe her  I mean  Come on now  Hmm  That's ridiculous  Yeah  No one could have imagined it  Hey, do you smoke a lot of pot?  No, I don't smoke any pot  No  I don't know  What about the wing damage 
[03:19:30]  That didn't occur on the Pentagon?  That's a question I have  I didn't hear it  I'm sorry  What about the wing damage  That didn't occur on the Pentagon?  They're saying that's part of the proof  That the plane didn't hit the Pentagon  Because there's no wing damage on the plane  I'm sorry  I have a film of an F-16 fighter pilot  Being driven into a wall  Shut up  And it literally disintegrated on impact  I have a friend  By the name of John Judge  You have no friends  Who's the co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch  Who has a friend  Who was a stewardess on that flight 
[03:20:00]  Not a friend, he's just another guy  Who doesn't get pussy  And she went to the Pentagon that day  Saw upholstery that she recognized  She saw windows that she recognized  She saw the dead bodies  I mean it was definitely a plane that hit the Pentagon  That's why I don't like to focus on those things  Because it takes it away from what you're trying to accomplish  What are you focusing on besides boring everyone?  If that makes any sense  Well, what are you saying then?  I don't understand what you're saying  You're saying that there's no big conspiracy thing 
[03:20:30]  You want to stay away from things like missiles and planes  That don't exist  Well, no, no, no  But you're not  Let's talk about  What's your point on this whole thing?  My point on this whole thing  Is that the government was compliant  In some way, shape, or form  With the events of 9-11  I mean look at who benefited from it  Who?  Bell helicopter?  Who?  Go ahead  Yeah, I'm sorry  Look at who benefited from it  Who?  If you look at the actions of the Bush administration  After 9-11 
[03:21:00]  They look more guilty  Than they do for their actions prior to 9-11  I mean they literally use 9-11 to further their agenda  Well, does that necessarily mean that you were involved in something?  Even if you use something to your advantage after it happens  Does that mean you were involved with it happening?  Well, it's obvious that  It's like taking lemons and making lemonade  Atta boy, Ant  You didn't grow the lemons  It's obvious that when Bush first came into office  His main objective 
[03:21:30]  And according to Paul O'Neill  Who, I quote  Said  Paul O'Neill is better because he retired  And they replaced him in right field  After his inauguration  Paul O'Neill, who was the treasury secretary at the time  Said it was about finding a way to do it  That was the tone of the president saying  Go find me a way to do this  To get into Iraq you're talking about  This is Iraq  There were 20,000 other ways to get into Iraq  Besides being involved with killing a few thousand Americans  Yeah, but would we have gone into Iraq or Afghanistan 
[03:22:00]  Had 9-11 not happened?  Maybe not Afghanistan, but definitely Iraq  We'd have been there  We had enough reason  Why would we have gone into Iraq?  The same reason we went  Weapons of mass destruction  Breaking the U.N. sanctions  There were no weapons of mass destruction  But the excuse was used  I'm not saying there were  I'm saying the excuses to go into Iraq  Has nothing to do with 9-11  It has everything to do with 9-11  No it doesn't  Based on what they were saying  The friggin' U.N. sanctions were enough to get us back into Iraq  If a president really wanted to get back in there 
[03:22:30]  The 9-11  To even think  That the government in any way shape or form  Had any knowledge or involvement in 9-11  Is crazy kind of conspiracy theorist  Right  Nut job stuff to spew  I don't agree  I think this guy might  Sir, do you have any evidence that kind of points in that direction?  Evidence  Evidence?  I have several evidence  Several evidence  A friend of mine  By the name of Mary Schneider  Who was  She a fucking 
[03:23:00]  A whistleblower  A maintenance person  One day at a time  She got to be fired  Hey, Mrs. Romano  She came out  Tommy, shut up  In 1998  She started sending letters  To the Department of Justice  And the FBI  And so forth  Saying  That there were sham marriages taking place  Meaning that  Oh my god, you're a kook  What is this actually?  Sham marriages?  Go ahead, let him continue  Let him finish  I want to hear this  Alright  There were sham marriages taking place  Which means that people were coming out of the country  And marrying somebody  And for citizenship 
[03:23:30]  And the people at the INS were taking bribes  Of $10,000 and more  Okay  To get these marriages into place  Alright, this all seems like it could happen  And it's fine and well  And it probably has and does happen  Okay, absolutely  But one of the things that she found out  Was that  Khalil bin Laden  Osama bin Laden's brother  Uh huh  Um  Was associated  With one of the sham marriage participants  By the name of  Leahzid Abid  Alright 
[03:24:00]  Who married Christine Sharrick  Uh for citizenship  And he did a movie with Kevin Bacon  That's  See how it all connects  Absolutely  Look at you guys  You're awesome  Um  No, basically  He married  He married Christine  Oh my god  Shut up  Shut up  Leahzid Abid was the chauffeur  Dude, you've lost everybody  Yeah  Hold on  You've just lost everybody  Your line of connection to how the government was involved in 9-11  The 9-11  You have a friend of a friend 
[03:24:30]  You lost who has a friend  You already lost it though  It's not evidence  You've gone too far already for it to even be evidence  You mentioned the Kennedy assassination  Yeah  You tied in the Stebbins Freeway side  He did that to prove a point  But what I'm saying is  Mary Schneider  Khalil Bin Laden had associations with Mohammed Atta  Uh huh  Do you remember him?  Yes, he had a pilot that flew into the first building  Alright, Khalil Bin Laden was born out of the country on September 19, 2001 under White House approval  Now, why would they do that? 
[03:25:00]  Uh, because he obviously was very good with his hands and they needed work done  Why would you let somebody associated with attack  I mean, for crying out loud, Cat Stevens was turned away  Easy with that kind of language  After 9-11, the pre-9-11 mindset was  Uh, this stuff happened  It wasn't really priority  Should it have been?  Of course  Does it mean you're, you're, uh, involved?  No  It means that there were some stupid people who let a lot of things slip by that shouldn't have  And in hindsight, it now makes sense that we should have looked into it 
[03:25:30]  Does it mean that they were involved?  There's no evidence  You know something?  If you had some clear evidence, I would go, wow, and let me consider that  Absolutely  It does seem like there was involvement  I've heard these, I've heard these theories before, over and over again  And there's never, ever, ever any evidence  Can I, can I ask you something, uh, Jonathan?  This is what bugs me about you mentioning the Kennedy assassination  The reason that's an interesting conspiracy is because there is something like the Zapruder film  Or Commander Humes and the statements he made, uh, in the, uh, the autopsy room that were overheard by Siebert and O'Neill, the FBI agent 
[03:26:00]  There's nothing that you're giving except for speculation  There's no, uh, you understand what I mean?  There's no real evidence  Here's what I recommend doing  Here's what I recommend doing  Uh, Stanley Hilton  Oh, my God, another name  Oh, my God, another name  Oh, my God, another name  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Well, I put Hilton in the search engine, but other things keep coming up  Yeah, some hot blonde giving a blowjob comes up  Anyway, Stanley Hilton is a lawyer for 400 family members who are suing the Bush administration under the RICO Act 
[03:26:30]  Uh, Ellen Mariani is the RICO Act  Ah, see, I'm George W. Bush, see?  Ah, you'll never get me, you lousy screw  Exactly  Yeah, exactly  It's ridiculous  All right  This is absolutely ridiculous  All right, listen, Jonathan, the left has allowed their hatred of Bush  To drive them into such a frenzy because he is  You understand, this has nothing to do with Bush  This has nothing to do with politics  But you just said Bush was a murderer  So it does have something to do with Bush 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, but it also has something to do with previous administrations  It has to do with our policies in the Middle East  I know, we brought it on ourselves  You're giving the, uh, the whole let's go for the root cause argument  We brought it on ourselves somehow  Why? Because we support Israel  Because we have troops in Saudi Arabia  That's the whole guilty left we brought it on ourselves argument  You know what a hero you'd be if you exposed the 9-11, uh, plot  Let me ask you a question  The 9-11 Commission refused to follow any of the funding of 9-11 
[03:27:30]  Now, isn't the first rule in any investigation to follow the money?  Uh, yeah  Okay, well they didn't do that  I'm just saying yeah, I don't know what the first rule of the investigation is  They didn't do it  And do you know why?  No, why?  Because countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan partially funded 9-11  Now that I could grab a hold of  Yes, I could too  I absolutely think Saudi Arabia was, uh, involved in some way  But, don't make, now don't stop  No, no, I'm not gonna listen to a ten degree separation between Saudi Arabia and George Bush 
[03:28:00]  Or anyone else  I've heard it before, sir  Yeah, uh, we got listeners that want in on this  James in Tennessee  Go ahead James, you're on with, uh, Jonathan  Man, this guy, he has got absolutely nothing  I mean, what the hell evidence is he even talking about?  God damn  Well, there you go  The truckers have spoken  What the hell evidence do you have?  Uh, Pat from Buffalo  Hey, this guy is a friend of a friend who saw upholstery 
[03:28:30]  But I have a friend of a friend of a friend who was in a convention in Las Vegas  And went up to a hotel room and got their kidney taken out  Wow, I know that guy  And he woke up and there was a note that said get to the hospital  Is that when Mohamed Atta was on an elevator and he said hit the floor  And they laid on the actual floor  But he was just gonna send them roses later  Because he was just telling them to hit the floor he was going to  Alright, listen, Karen Talitowski was a colonel who was working at the Pentagon  Another name, another name we have to look at  Wait, who's, let's just say a benefactor is General Y 
[03:29:00]  There's a lot, but let me finish  Okay  She was working at the Pentagon on the day of 9-11  Uh huh  I met this woman this past anniversary  In Washington D.C.  And she literally, she cries to this day  When telling the story about how a plane came into the Pentagon  And killed a lot of her friends  Yeah  And it sickens me  Well  What's that got to do with anything?  Because that happened  There's a million of those stories  I'm willing to believe that happened  The Pentagon was manipulating information to get into the war into the Iraq  Uh, Jim from Tennessee, go ahead 
[03:29:30]  Get the fucking net off my radio  Now you gotta let him talk  You know, I mean  I just wanted to give you some evidence  Oh my god, I swear to god he just hung up on himself  He hung up  He hasn't  I'm sorry, he just hung up on himself  He hung up  Figures  That's what they do on the left  Whenever, whenever challenged on their evidence  They, uh, they, they panic and run away  That's why they only want to go on shows like Air America  And other liberal stations  That won't question their idiocy  What happened?  Bush did use Al-Qaeda  A connection  Sure 
[03:30:00]  And 9-11 to justify the war in Iraq  Yeah  After the weapons of mass destruction story fell apart  There you go  But not to get into Iraq  There were plenty of reasons to get into Iraq  Plenty of, like, bullshit reasons  Yeah  That they could've pulled out of their ass  Alright, he's back  The Nazis in Norfolk were tried  Specifically because they preemptively struck  Were invaded another country  That's against the law  I'm not saying  That is against the law  Dude, dude, I'm not saying the attack in Iraq was good  Justified, legal, or anything 
[03:30:30]  I'm just saying the, the 9-11 events  Had nothing to do with Bush going into Iraq  Then why did Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld  And Condoleezza Rice try to tie Iraq to Al-Qaeda  They did that after the, they were doing that to justify their story  When the weapons of mass destruction thing fell apart  They were using keywords like terror and terrorists and war on terror  Of course, because it worked for them  It worked to get them into Iraq  It doesn't mean they were responsible for 9-11  They used 9-11 to bolster their case to go into Iraq 
[03:31:00]  What about the warnings  What about all of the warnings that said that 9-11 was going to take place  I mean, there's a multitude of warnings  What warnings?  It almost took place in 93  I mean, on Clinton's watch  Except only six people died  Yeah  Yeah, a warning  Isn't that a shame that six people don't warrant a commission but 3,000 do?  Well, can you not see the difference between six and 3,000?  Absolutely  When's the last time 3,000 people were killed in a car accident?  I'm not saying that it's right  But there is a difference between six and 3,000  And you know that  Absolutely, and it's a shame that we conceive it that way  Well, I know, the world's an awful place 
[03:31:30]  So let me ask you a question  What root causes do you think contributed to 9-11 then?  What fault of the US?  What Middle East policy?  I know the re-examine the Middle East policy  The left always says  Well, it's very simple  The US policies in regards to the Middle East favor the minority  Which happens to be Israel  Uh-huh  The left is so predictable  The only civilized democratic country in the area  So you're saying that  So we're siding with the people that aren't filthy animals that are trying to kill us constantly  Wow, what a surprise  You know, basically what's happening  I mean, who supports Israel more than any other country? 
[03:32:00]  United States  US  Okay, who within the United States supports Israel more than any other people?  Don't say Jews  It's not the Jews  Right, absolutely  It's the Southern Baptists, Catholics, Christians  People who believe that the Jews have to be in Israel in order for Jesus to return  I mean, that's ridiculous  No, it's more of a military ideology because we have a foothold in the Middle East  It's absolutely that  It's a matter of security and, you know, the religious thing  Let me ask you a question  Do you know how much oil we have left?  How much? 
[03:32:30]  I'm sure you know  How much?  In our estimation, there's about 60 to 90 years left of oil  Uh-huh  60 to 90 years left  That doesn't include growth, more people on the road, more people buying cars  And this ties into 9-11, how, sir?  Well, because we're here and our oil and resources are over there  Yeah  It doesn't matter, we'll be gone  Who cares?  You're only spouting rhetoric  You're not bringing any evidence  It's all rhetoric  Right  It's all passion and emotion 
[03:33:00]  But no evidence  All right, Randy the trucker  Go ahead, Randy  Hey, man, I love you guys  But this guy's got more air coming out of him than my train horns  Okay?  What kind of criticism, Randy?  Don't be so strong  This guy's a windbag  Jesus  Jesus, man  All right, yeah  We gotta wrap this thing up, Jonathan  All right, here's what I'll tell you  The 9-11 families got together a list of 400 questions  400 well-researched questions  These are the people that made Washington, D.C. open the 9-11 Commission 
[03:33:30]  Uh-huh  The 9-11 Commission only answered about, I believe, 14 of those 400 answers  And this past week, about 40 family members and about 100 prominent people signed a letter to Attorney General Elliot Spitzer asking him to reopen the 9-11 investigation  About two months ago, a Zogby poll was run that said New York City believes that the government consciously failed to act to prevent the attacks of 9-11 
[03:34:00]  Consciously failed to react, yeah, sure  66% of them think the investigation should be reopened  Yeah, well, the American public also thinks American Idol is a terrific show  What does that mean?  Stop with the Israeli argument  Stop with the Israel argument  It doesn't hold water  Bin Laden predominantly hates the United States because we have troops in the Arabian Peninsula  It's not about Israel  If it was about Israel, they would help the Palestinians, but they don't help the Palestinians  They don't give a shit about the Palestinians  What?  Have you ever read Osama's 1996 Fatwa? 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, but it was really predictable and hacky, and I fell asleep before it ended, and then I loaned it out and never got it back  I got the pop-up book  So you're basically saying it didn't happen because you say so  What I'm saying is I get tired of that same trite argument from the left because you're legitimizing the motives of the people doing it, saying that their reasoning is real  Can there be accountability?  I mean, Jesus Christ  There is accountability  He's a religious fanatic  3,000 people died  And now one single person has been held accountable  Yeah, one person has been held accountable 
[03:35:00]  Bin Laden, Omar, Al-Zawari, yeah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  A lot of people have been held accountable  The whole Taliban government  Exactly  Talking about people who were inept in their jobs, in the government  Hey, now you can say that  George Tenet stepped down as he should have  You can say they were inept in their work, that they should have seen this, that the signs were there  But to turn that into they were involved is ridiculous  You're trying to marry yourself, Jonathan  You're trying to marry yourself to the tragedy to stand out and be the guy that figured out what nobody else could see 
[03:35:30]  You're trying to somehow capitalize  It's not just me  A bunch of people like you, right  There's not millions  Believe me, there's nothing new in your argument  I've been emailed this crap in my inbox for four years now  Not one piece of evidence  Okay, so then why all the sudden interest?  There isn't a sudden interest  Because people  If you've been emailed this crap for four years, then why have me on the show?  Because you want to hear about it  We wanted to hear if you had anything new 
[03:36:00]  Any bit of evidence that makes sense other than just left-wing idiotic rhetoric  We were giving you a chance to prove your point  I had Ben, and I sent Steve proof of a 9-11 cover-up  No, you did not  Yes, I did  What proof did you send?  I sent them a flight manifest that shows Khalil bin Laden left the country  I showed that Khalil bin Laden had affiliations with Mohammed Atta  I sent this all to them  Yeah, this is nothing  That's not proof  It's nothing 
[03:36:30]  The government was behind 9-11  Well  Here's the questions you emailed  Jonathan  These are the questions you emailed Ben for us to ask  How did you get interested in the truth about 9-11?  Not that it's not fascinating to hear about your thought process  Question 2  Why did 9-11 happen?  Question 3  Who benefited from 9-11?  Question 4  What did the August 6th PDB talk about?  What is the PDB?  No, you had to ask him that  The presidential  I don't really care  Number 5  What about the boot options that were purchased on American and United Airlines on September 9th and September 10th? 
[03:37:00]  Right  Number 6  Who financed 9-11?  Pakistan, Saudi Arabia  Yeah, okay  Well, we're not going to argue with that  Number 7  Do you agree with the 9-11 Commission's findings?  Not at all  I'm kind of asking as a joke  I think they're adding a layer of bureaucracy to a system that's fully bureaucratic  And fascinating question  This is the type of monologue you have alone on your couch  Like you've dreamed about being asked these questions in front of a Senate subcommittee and finally being important 
[03:37:30]  These are the type of things while you're squeezing a log on the bowl  You sit there and pretend you're talking and being an important person  You're like the Ronnie Kovics of the 9-11  And it's ridiculous  Here you go  Number 8  See, lucky for me, your opinion of me really doesn't matter  I know, opinions are like buttholes, aren't they?  My opinion does matter, sir  Oh, it does? Why?  Because I'm a Jew and I'm responsible for 9-11  You jackass  Shut up!  Left-wing psychopath  At least the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists have evidence  That's 40 years ago and they have more evidence than you have about something that happened 3 years ago 
[03:38:00]  First of all, thanks for having me on  But, you know, this is absolutely ridiculous for you to think that your opinion matters  I mean, Christ  Well, why do you think yours matters?  Who's buying serious stock and who's buying XM stock?  Tell me that  What?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  It means that your opinion means shit because people are going to serious and not XM  Are they really?  Oh my God, are you insane?  He hung up  That was his idea of the big 
[03:38:30]  XM stock, by the way, 33 bucks and change  33 and a half  Serious stock is 384 about  Yeah, about 380  So who's buying what?  Who cares?  I'll tell you who's buying serious stock  Bin Laden and Mohammed Atta  You fucking idiot, shut up  And serious stock, you know, I love how his argument had to come down to nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan  How diluted is serious stock?  There's a billion, gazillion shares of serious stock out there  That stupid, guilty, that guilty, liberal, we brought it on ourselves, dog shit argument 
[03:39:00]  What an ass  God, that bugs me  Oh, that was nice, getting all riled up  It's just, I've heard it before  Of course  We know what it is  It's the same argument  That guilty, Jew-hating nonsense  And that's what that is, that hatred of Israel, and it's irritating  You know what, we're going to have to go to CNN now for dick jokes  I know  Thanks  Thanks  Sorry  That guy  Just an ass  We gave him a shot  Just wants to mean something  Just wants to be before that subcommittee  What do you think, Mr. Gold?  I'll tell you what I think 
[03:39:30]  And what I've been thinking alone instead of getting laid all these years  Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman  This committee owes Jonathan Gold an apology  Senator  It was between the brothers, Kay  Khalid and Osama  Yeah, I was a buffer  Yeah, I worked with his father in the construction business in Saudi Arabia  You fucking idiot, shut up  Curious stock is better  Click  Ugh 
[03:40:00]  Hey, hey buddy  Did you hear what I said to them?  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  You fucking conspiracy asshole  Shut your face  Holy shit  What a boar  What a predictable, guilty, American-hating boar  And I'm not saying Saudi Arabia shouldn't be bombed  Because we really should murder everybody in that fucking awful country  God do I get so sick of hearing that trite shit  You ask him for evidence  All emotional nonsense  You ask him for evidence 
[03:40:30]  You ask him for evidence  And he goes into this whole thing about  Well, there was a marriage  Sham marriage  What?  What?  Sham marriage is  Dom Marrero was in one  Was he responsible?  You fucking idiot  Are we done?  Had it  That really irritated me  We're done  I want to give the guy a chance to talk and to express his opinion  Yeah  But he had nothing  Well, who's the most hated people in the Middle East?  I don't know, Pakistan hates India  India hates Pakistan  There you go  How is that the Jews fault? 
[03:41:00]  Hiding over that shitty piece of land  Which is worth less than Staten Island real estate wise  But that's apparently America  Imperialist America's fault  Fucking dullard  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting  In the Opie and Anthony laboratory  Oh my god, baby  Hey guys, anyone want a bagel?  No!  No!  Stop ruining the show, Eric  The Opie and Anthony Show 
[03:41:30]  Feel the love  You know what's worried about New York  And I was  This is my little story of my life  I was born in New York  And I grew up in Florida  Hollywood, Florida  Which is a very beautiful place  But it's very different  And I used to talk like this  When I was a little kid  Because I'm from Brooklyn  You know, I used to talk like this  And my mola made the best fucking spaghetti  In the fucking neighborhood  And that's how we talk  And I moved to Florida  And the kids used to make fun of my accent  And they're like  Hey kids, say something  Hey, what do you want me to say?  And they go  So you become aware of your accent  So it's not really a stick  But the weird thing about the New York accent  There's no logical way 
[03:42:00]  The New York accent could have been conceived  No logical way  First people in America were who?  The United States were who?  Danish  Danish, right?  Well, you have a different textbook than we did  Because  It was an Indian thing  I don't know  Maybe you're missing chapter one  Or you're absent that day  We forget the Indians  But I know what you meant  And you're right in a sense  If you just like  Wipe off the Indians  Like we did  Many, many years ago  You know, that's an easy way to figure that  But you were  The good thing is  You were ready with the answer right away  You know, you didn't 
[03:42:30]  You had ten or twenty seconds  Before the buzzer was gonna sound  But you were  Danish!  You know what I mean?  Unless you were ordering from the bar  And I didn't  You know what I mean?  It was like  Danish!  And they were like  Oh shit, the timing was impeccable  You know?  But  Yeah  But anyway  The first people in America were Indians  And their accent is nothing like New York  And the first people to settle in the United States  In New York  Were British people  And their accent is nothing like New York  The Dutch  Well the Dutch  The Dutch didn't stay long  They went all the way down to Bowling Green  They couldn't find parking  They fucked off and went home 
[03:43:00]  That's what happened with the Danish  It's really true  But the British actually were the settlers  And they  And  But  No matter what  There's no logical way  The accent could have been conceived  Because even if it was  Indians and Danish  How did Kimo Sabi  And like alright  Turn into Opioz Joey  You know what I mean?  Right?  There's no natural progression anywhere  Unless Christopher Columbus spoke that way  He was like  Hey, who's sailing the frickin' Nina?  Jesus  That boat's going up and down  All over the ocean over there  This guy's a freak  Look at him  He's going up and down  Now 
[03:43:30]  He's drunk like Delaware  You know  Heather  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson  With America's Car Show  Tip of the day  On XM Radio  An all season tire is one that has a tread design  That dissipates weather elements  From under the tire's footprint  As it rolls down the road  Now all season tires literally pump water  Snow and such from under the tire  In addition, the tread is designed to squeegee the road service  Giving the tire maximum traction  Now the tread is designed in such a way that if you were to pour water over it 
[03:44:00]  You'd notice that the water is directed out the side of the tire  In addition, an all season tire is made of rubber compound that doesn't freeze below 32 degrees  Why?  Because for the tread to self-clean or create a pumping action  It must be able to move as it rolls  If it were to freeze below 32 degrees then it would not stay pliable and thus self-clean  Got a question?
