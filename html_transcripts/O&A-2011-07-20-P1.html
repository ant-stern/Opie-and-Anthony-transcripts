<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Larry King's voice introducing the broadcast.  In studio were Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, whose birthday was celebrated. Norton grumbled about receiving money from his parents as a gift. He then recounted his experiences on Otto's show ("The Pig Roast with Otto and George"), a variety show with dancing girls ("The Piglets"), contrasting it with the more serious tone of Bill Tetley's show. He also detailed his attendance at the Entourage premiere, mentioning Dice Clay's performance and encounters with various celebrities, including someone who played Patrick Stewart. The hosts expressed mixed feelings about the later seasons of *Entourage*.

The conversation then turned to a scathing critique of Stan Lee's *Superhumans*, mocking the host's perceived effeminacy and the apparent fakery of the show's feats, like a samurai slicing a speeding bullet (believed to be CGI). Callers contributed to this critique, mentioning other questionable stunts, such as a man sucking an armadillo through a PVC pipe.

The hosts discussed their upcoming Comic-Con trip, anticipating meetings with Justin Timberlake and Daniel Craig. The *Superhumans* discussion continued, with a caller focusing on a freediver segment, prompting further debate about authenticity. A clip of the Honey Badger video was played at length.  The show then transitioned to discussions of Rupert Murdoch (including a pie-in-the-face incident), height preferences in relationships, and the News of the World scandal.

A significant portion of the show focused on the outrageously high cost of rebuilding the Tappan Zee Bridge ($9 billion, or $16 billion with commuter rail). The hosts and callers speculated about union wages, corruption, and government inefficiency, comparing the cost to that of the Empire State Building in 1930.  Videos of large ships narrowly clearing bridges, including the Queen Mary 2 under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and a ship colliding with a bridge were shown.  A caller recounted a cruise ship tilting on its side.  The conversation also included an apology owed to Fez (a co-host from another show), discussions of trucking tolls, a skyscraper builder's perspective on construction costs, a Philadelphia texting ticket story, a bizarre tale of a man having sex with horses, and racist language used by the hosts.  SiriusXM channels, particularly the derided Cinemagic channel with its low listenership, were also discussed.

Another segment began with a discussion of Cinemagic's removal from standard car satellite radio and its online-only availability.  Audio clips from Cinemagic were played and ridiculed. The conversation shifted to Comic-Con, mentioning a Hot Wheels DeLorean and Spielberg's promotional methods. A playful competition ensued, comparing Opie's Motorola Atrix and Anthony's iPhone in a speed-photography challenge. Fez was a guest during this segment.  The show then segued into a news story about increased bicycle safety enforcement in Philadelphia, leading to anecdotes about hitting animals while driving and a discussion of animal intelligence.

The Casey Anthony media coverage and speculation about who would interview her were briefly addressed.  The show concluded with an extended phone call with Sam's mother, Bobby.  The conversation, heavily laced with sexually suggestive questions, crude humor, and offensive comments, covered Sam's sex life, past girlfriends (including racist comments about one ex-girlfriend), and a fictionalized, highly suggestive description of Bobby's shower routine.  They also discussed Sam’s underpayment at work and his upcoming Comic-Con trip with Jim, including speculation about Jim's behavior. Bobby promised to send the hosts baked goods. The broadcast ended abruptly to allow Sam and his colleague to leave for their trip.  Throughout the show, numerous phone calls from listeners contributed to the ongoing conversations.  A final Honey Badger clip was played before the show’s end.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Happy birthday to you.  That was yesterday. 
[00:01:00]  That was yesterday.  How do you know? It's his birthday every day.  Yeah, but yesterday was the real birthday.  Of Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton. How did that go, Jimmy?  How was your birthday? Did you get presents?  I went to, I got some little envelope from my parents.  I hate when they send me money, but it was nice.  They sent you money.  Better than what you get me.  It's so funny when your parents send you money.  I hate that.  My mom doesn't. 
[00:01:30]  Take a little bit.  She'll throw a $20 in a birthday card or some of the in-laws or not the actual in-laws, but people involved with the in-laws.  I'm like, I don't need money.  Just send me a nice card.  That's good enough.  Thank you.  Although the older people in my family send a prayer where they say, this Sunday during the 10 a.m. mass, there will be a prayer for your birthday.  You get those?  No, if I did, I would fucking plant my fist in their face through the card. 
[00:02:00]  What are you going to do?  I don't want a prayer.  If you're part of a family, it runs the gamut.  Really?  The Our Father?  That's what you're giving me?  Yeah, the religious people will send you some kind of prayer.  That's hideous.  For events.  How was your birthday?  You do anything?  No, I did Otto's show in the afternoon.  How was that?  I wanted to go, man.  It was like an interview with a variety show.  He was really funny.  Is Bill Tetley pissed off?  No, it's very different than Bill Tetley's show.  There's too much going on.  There's hot girls on Otto's show. 
[00:02:30]  There's like a band.  Bill Tetley's not having any of that.  Oh, wow.  What is this Otto's show?  It's like he's kind of interviewing you, but he's making fun of the girls who are dancing for him.  He had a couple of really funny lines, man.  Big A.  My big surprise was Big A.  He popped in and sang Happy Birthday.  That fucking stuttering serial killer.  That awfulness.  In a birthday suit?  No, just his head popped up through a window.  What?  What's going on?  Where can we see the Otto and George show? 
[00:03:00]  I don't know.  It's going to be on.  Does he know?  Yeah, well, it's a new network.  It's a computer online network, but you can watch it on HD on TV.  I don't understand it, but it's probably where all TV is going eventually.  Yeah.  Is he ahead of the curve?  Yeah, I think so.  I went to the Entourage premiere last night.  A show that I'm not that familiar with, but I just went to see Dice.  Was Dice in town?  Yeah, he is.  Is he coming in?  Next week, I think.  Oh, okay.  He's on like five or six episodes. 
[00:03:30]  He was really funny in the show.  That show was made for him.  I know.  Yeah, he was great.  I've tapped out.  I haven't seen Entourage in a couple seasons.  I used to love the show.  I don't know what happens with some of these shows.  I've got to get back into it, I guess.  I just kind of see that show.  Especially with Dice on it.  The show was like, wow, these guys is cool.  Look at them all hanging out and being cool.  It's Hollywood.  It's all right.  You know what?  You just nailed it.  It was one of those shows that it just didn't feel like it was growing anymore for me.  You know, The Wire kept growing and Curb has its own thing, but that show just seemed 
[00:04:00]  to be stuck in the same kind of situation week after week.  Oh, look, they're going to another party.  It's wild.  There's chicks.  They're smoking weed.  They're in a giant hotel room.  Whoa.  That's like every episode I saw, that was it.  Oh, and he's got his hangers on and his fucking people.  Hey, look out.  We get through the velvet rope.  Whoa, look at us.  We're in the club again.  Oh, right. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  What's Turtle up to this week?  Whoa, look, he's got a chick.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  They're pulling up to the Lincoln Continental with the suicide doors.  Pulling up to the club.  Convertible, bitch.  We all getting laid tonight.  Of course they are.  I love this song.  I can't take that show.  It's very much like a...  Turn it down.  I don't like the vocals.  I just like the...  It's like a fan... 
[00:05:00]  It's like...  It is kind of...  It represents a lot of what I don't like about L.A.  Oh, it's everything I hate about anything having to do with L.A.  That Hollywood scene.  But you know what?  We should say this.  With Dice in the show, I'm watching.  He was very funny, man.  I think it was really smart to get Dice involved.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Because I'm back in.  I'll watch Entourage this season.  And, dude, he's playing himself.  It's funny to see him.  They showed two episodes.  He's at Andrew Dice Clay?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  But the things he's doing... 
[00:05:30]  So you can see there's a little self-destructive vibe.  And I saw him.  It was so good to see him.  And I'm like, you're playing yourself.  He's like, yeah, I know.  It was really good.  That's cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was he with his wife?  With his wife.  And I saw...  You know, I said hello to my pal Omar.  I see Michael Williams.  Oh, nice.  Oh, my God.  You know who was there who I didn't get a photo with?  You're stalking me.  I was the guy who played Patrick Stewart.  The guy who played Picard.  Oh, Jean-Luc Picard. 
[00:06:00]  In Star Trek.  I should have got a picture with him.  But I was like, who fucking cares?  Oh, that's kind of big, though.  It is, but...  Any Kirk.  Any Kirk is...  He was talking to somebody.  A captain.  You know who I got a picture with?  Sabatka from season two of The Wire.  That's who I cared about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's a much younger guy in person, you'd think.  Wait, but more importantly, Sam just handed out Entourage.  What, are we supposed to watch this now?  Why are you handing this out at the Milvar radio show?  Because you were just talking about it.  So what am I supposed to do?  Watch now?  No, not now.  You just comment on it. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, I got the first three episodes.  Then you put it down.  Then you can bring it home and watch it.  Should we, like, get some food and just sit back and watch now?  I mean, look.  I'm not going to tell you how to run your radio show.  Let's do that.  Well, you hand it out in such a way, like, we should watch this now.  I like Entourage.  We should watch it.  We should.  Just watch it.  Let's just watch it, then.  Wait, Dice is in all...  All three.  The first three episodes?  Yeah.  The second one, he's in more.  I didn't see the third one.  But the first one, he's in a little bit.  And the second one, he's in a lot.  Fuck, I got to watch this.  Very cool.  Getting back to Dice really quickly. 
[00:07:00]  Did he remember calling us from the bathroom?  Hi.  Oh, I didn't ask him.  I don't know.  Yeah, we were smoking weed.  What a weird conversation that was.  That was an odd one.  Yeah.  It was...  Fuck, now I should have got a picture of Patrick Stewart.  Yeah, Patrick Stewart's a big one.  That's a tough one to get, actually.  Is it?  That's a big one.  I'm not even joking with you.  It really is.  In the geek community, that's a tough one to get.  I just didn't...  He was with people the whole time, and I just didn't care enough.  See?  See how tough it was?  I could have.  He was never alone.  You guys are going to Comic-Con, right? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Do you have any itinerary?  Do you have credentials?  Is this going to be an easier way for you to get into more things than just sitting there  at round tables with geeks?  I believe that much more thought has been put into this year's trip, especially based  on what happened after we came back from last year's trip.  Well, exactly.  Live and learn, as we like to say.  And this company likes to say, live and make the same mistakes.  Well, what's beautiful is, though, that they put Roland in charge of booking, so that way 
[00:08:00]  if we come back and they haven't gotten us anything, then management can say, that would  be Roland's fault.  Oh, okay.  It's perfect.  They threw a buffer in.  Yeah.  Plenty of buffers.  Roland has emailed me tons of potential stuff.  Everything gets finalized at the last minute.  So what are you looking at, perhaps, that could be cool?  Well, Roland has said there's a possibility of a Justin Timberlake. 
[00:08:30]  Ah, because of this.  Okay.  And what would that be because of?  I think he's there.  Roland said he's there for MySpace.  He is an investor in MySpace.  Yes, he is.  But he might have made it up.  I don't know.  I think Roland is just saying that because he was in Social Network.  He doesn't really know what his connection is.  He's in Friends with Benefits, isn't he?  Yes.  But he's not there with Milik Yunus.  He's about Amanda Seyfried.  What about my good friend, Daniel Craig, who will be there for Cowboys and Aliens? 
[00:09:00]  Uh, he, right now, the only thing that's open is like a press line red carpet type thing.  Oh, yuck.  Which I, we kind of said, no.  But hey, let's call him right now.  He's your good friend.  I know.  Do you want to wake him up right now?  You got his phone number?  Well, it's probably early there in San Diego.  We probably wouldn't want to wake him up.  Good point, good point.  What do you want to do?  Around 9 o'clock?  Let him sleep in a little bit?  Yeah, yeah.  Let him sleep in.  You know what?  I should do it from home.  You're a good friend.  I should do it from home.  You're a good friend. 
[00:09:30]  I think I'm interviewing Stan Lee tonight.  What?  Stan Lee.  Stan Lee.  That hack?  For something, yeah.  Actually, talk to him about that fruit that hosts that show.  Super Peter.  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  And there it was.  A man that was moving like he was made of rubber.  I don't know that show.  That show is Stan Lee's Superhuman.  Is that still on the air?  I caught a replay of it, and it's Superhumans.  And the host sounds like the Honey Badger guy.  The host sounds like if there is a sound that could be gay, that's the sound. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, boy.  But then he brings his voice down and tries to man up when he gets to the end of his sentence.  Yeah, very bad.  It feels good on my sensitive skin.  Well, enough of the fucking ads.  And the ads are getting longer.  Look, this is 30 seconds.  What happened to the 10-second quick little ads?  Thing of the past.  And you only need 10 seconds to get your point across as far as commercials go. 
[00:10:30]  How about when they start doing back-to-back ads?  Because now it's one ad.  What if they start doing two?  Could you pause that for a second?  Yeah.  Do you remember I had the vision when we were at NAW when they were killing us with commercials?  It was up to like, I think it was up to 28 minutes an hour.  Oh, that's great.  And I went to Ken Stevens.  I'm like, can we, let's reinvent radio.  And he laughed at me.  Of course.  I go, why don't we get all the salespeople together and say, look, Opie and Anthony will  only do 15-second ads. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  And he's like, the agencies and the, well, I don't even not buy.  I go, but.  30 or 60.  What the fuck are you talking about?  I go, but Ken, most commercials, because we don't have anyone writing the commercials  and no one's creative in that department, they just fill up the commercial time with crap  after 15 seconds.  They get 15 solid seconds of what the product is about.  And then the other 15 seconds is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I said, let's, let's cut out the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And we'll set a precedent in the radio industry.  We'll only take 15-second ads and let's knock our commercial load in half.  Nice and concise.  And he told me to get out and prepare for a show or something.  So why don't you leave the office?  Leave me alone.  I have to go to Washington.  Yeah, but the point is the internet has that chance and they just can't break out of the  mold of a 30-second ad.  So now they're all turning into 30-second ads again.  And then most of it is blah, blah, blah, blah shit when you just need 10 seconds to get 
[00:12:00]  your point across.  I guess they need revenue from somewhere.  But that's fine.  But why 30 seconds?  You can't subscriber base it.  Why does it always have to be 30 fucking seconds?  Why?  Beat 60.  Beat 60.  Oh, really?  Watch what happens.  They're going to go right up to that second.  They'll go to 60.  Or they'll do back-to-back 30s.  Yeah, too.  Right.  Or 415s.  There's no way to win.  Yeah.  But this is what Ant's talking about?  The superhero show with Stan Lee and the host?  Yeah, yeah.  And his host. 
[00:12:30]  Now you're going to be interviewing.  They give a big warning disclaimer to not try any of these things by yourself because  you're not a superhuman.  It's so...  So, he's a samurai.  Okay, look at that.  It's rumored that Machi-san has taken hand-eye coordination beyond every other human on Earth.  He claims to be able to cut a speeding bullet in midair.  That's impossible, by the way.  So we've come to a firing range outside the hills of L.A. to see if it's true. 
[00:13:00]  I mean, it's a trick.  To see if it's true.  This is the size of the pellet Machi-san would try to slice with his sword.  It's an airsoft.  I honestly don't believe I could cut this if it was stationary on a chopping block.  I bet you could take a whole string full of them and shove them up your ass and pull  it out like you're starting a lawnmower.  Not only is the pellet tiny, over 4,000 times smaller than a baseball, but when it leaves  the barrel of the BB gun, it's traveling over 200 miles per hour. 
[00:13:30]  A normal person would have no chance of seeing the pellet.  He doesn't see it either.  So we're using a slow-motion camera to slow the action down by 250 times.  250 times.  And how to use Dr. Romany Dermasula.  Okay.  We're ready, Kay.  Kay is going to fire the pellet at Machi-san from a distance of 70 feet.  Oh, Machi-san.  You can't see that.  Of course you can.  He's got the stupid sword in his pocket.  And his scabbard.  Oh, yeah, scabbard's pocket. 
[00:14:00]  Or his sheath.  It's a trick, obviously.  That bullet has to hit the exact area where he's going to swing.  He didn't see that.  I saw a flash.  The blade went by.  Now, come on.  Can you pause this?  We're going to play it back.  Come on.  Before he plays it back.  Now, why can't this host be honest and go, that's impossible.  So why don't you tell me how you really did this?  Because Stan Lee would have me beaten.  Who's buying that?  No one.  That's impossible.  He just pulled his sword out of the sheath. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Whipped it around.  Right.  And then put it back in and was like, yeah, I cut it in half.  And meanwhile, you're not going to see where the fucking thing went.  No.  I'd like to see the high speed.  I believe it.  He's a samurai.  Well, that is true.  He is a samurai.  Oh, I thought you meant samurai.  Oh, samurai.  It's like, who's getting in the better room?  Samurai.  I.  Yeah, why would that ever be a question?  That's stupid.  A different hotel.  Of course it is. 
[00:15:00]  Airfare.  Why would you stay at a dirtbag, flea-infested shithole like Sam?  Well, I've made an arrangement for Sam to travel with us back and forth every day, so he's not alone.  Aww.  He's your driver?  Yes.  Exactly.  I get my hat.  Chauffeur's hat.  All right.  Let's see this trickery.  We'll look at it.  Using the slow motion camera, I want to see if Machi-san has achieved the superhuman.  The superhuman.  Oh, shit. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I saw some CGI there is what I think I saw.  Wow.  So we cut this tiny little pellet in half.  Why doesn't he play fucking baseball?  Yeah, exactly.  He'd hit a pitch every time with a bat.  Exactly.  This is about processing at an entirely different sensory level.  No, it's not.  Who's Dr. Romani?  The one they hired to make it more believable?  Pretty.  Her hair looks sickly, though, like a smoker.  She has sick girl hair.  Three counts of a second just to register the sound of the gun being fired before they can 
[00:16:00]  even start to think about reacting.  By the time they move the sword into position, the pellet would have traveled past them.  I think, yeah, this is the one.  Oh, we found it.  In the sand.  It's got a little nick in it.  This tiny little thing that Nicky took out with a sword.  Yeah.  This is absolutely superhuman. 
[00:16:30]  I would love to know, first of all, if that was really done.  How many takes?  But you don't even think it was really done?  I don't know.  And the person shooting the gun is shooting at a target somewhere else.  Of course.  So it's consistent.  You have a consistent trajectory.  Correct.  That this guy now might know how to pull out and where to put his sword.  So it's more the person shooting the sword blade than him cutting this errant fucking pellet in half. 
[00:17:00]  Take 4,875.  Yeah.  Can you get it?  It's a magic trick.  Yeah.  You know?  No, because the three pellets, when he hits it, it splits.  Yeah.  With the little pieces, it's CGI.  Because look where they disappear.  You can see them just disappear off the screen.  Do they just disappear?  Show the hit part again.  Where he hits it.  We may have to go back through the ads now.  No.  No, no.  Just hit play on that one.  Yes.  Back to the other ads.  More ads.  More ads. 
[00:17:30]  What are we supposed to do when there's ads on my show?  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  Not at all.  Of course not.  The Otto show, by the way, is called The Pig Roast with Otto and George.  Jimmy was great yesterday.  And Otto's dancers are called The Piglets.  Oh, that's right.  The Piglets.  The Piglets, yeah.  So was this episode shown already?  No, no, no, no.  Okay, so that was someone in the audience.  Now I have to go through the whole fucking thing, yeah?  Just to see the CGI.  Slide that bitch up.  Read the warning. 
[00:18:00]  There you go.  The warning probably says, we...  Warning fake.  We made all this up.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  Don't turn your back on the post.  Watch the three little pieces disappear.  Watch.  Top.  Do you see them just spin?  Oh, fuck.  They fucked up.  There's CGI.  Yeah, just watch.  Watch the bottom one.  Where are the top ones?  Watch the bottom one.  It's really obvious.  See, it's falling and then it goes away.  But how does the lungs just kind of fade?  Explain what she's just witnessed.  This isn't about...  Because they had to look like it was going into the distance and then going away. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  The fade part.  Oh, so this show's all bullshit.  You should ask Stan Lee about that.  Ask Stan Lee if his show is bullshit.  No.  There are really superhuman people.  That's what I'll say.  I've seen it before.  Superheroes.  The weather will be sunny with clear blue sky.  I miss Ira.  I saw Ira waving through a window the other day at me.  Yeah.  He was waving for me to come into whatever show he was doing. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, really?  I think I'll pass.  Yeah, it's sad because Ira liked doing this show.  Ira.  But Jay had to get all uppity.  He's afraid to do this show now.  Oh, Ira?  Of course he is.  He runs away because Jay put the fear of God in him.  Way to go, Jay.  How much are you paying him?  Probably nothing, right, Jay?  Nothing.  But you won't let him on other shows.  Very busy on Jay's show.  Doing the weather.  Anyway, so Entourage was good.  So you know what I'm obsessing about.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  You both know. 
[00:19:30]  Okay.  Spielberg.  No.  No, he's possible.  I should have got my...  What, you're obsessing about someone you could possibly meet at Comic Con?  No, but I should have got my photo.  Oh, now it's Jean-Luc Clark.  He charges like 150 bucks at, at, at, um...  At Comic Con's and conventions and stuff.  What's his name, John?  Oh, the, uh...  Patrick Stewart, right?  Patrick Stewart is, uh...  Why wouldn't you get his picture?  He is a big one.  When I first saw him, he was talking at the bar to somebody, and...  Was he putting a few back?  No, no, he was just talking.  Every time I saw him, he was talking. 
[00:20:00]  And I was actually right behind him walking out, but I was looking for guys, like, I really  want...  I wanted to...  Like, I see people I wanted to really see there.  You should have said, hey, uh, I'd like an autograph.  Can you make it so?  That's like a line from the movie.  I just was gonna get too annoyed if he said no.  Hey, engage your pen with my paper.  Ha, ha, ha, get it?  No.  Take a picture with me.  I never saw the, uh, next generation.  Uh, I saw a few.  Was it good?  Um, what a dumb question, by the way. 
[00:20:30]  I just wanted to acknowledge how stupid that question was.  Was it good?  Was it good?  I don't even know what I would ask.  Was it good?  I don't know what I would ask him.  What, Patrick Stewart?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was, you know, it's a fucking Star Trek show.  You could ask him anything.  Uh, let me see...  About that.  And then ask him about his Shakespeare in the park.  Well, really?  Right, we get it.  You want to be a real actor?  Didn't we have one of those, uh, broads on, and she was blowing guys in the park in  between performances or something?  Remember? 
[00:21:00]  No.  Help me out, Iraq.  It was the Shakespeare in the park.  Yes, he is, Professor.  Uh, that, that does not sound familiar.  It was the chick that came in and would put Christmas lights on, and she said she was  doing Shakespeare in the park, and then she'd blow guys in the woods, and...  Yeah, yeah.  Who the fuck was that psychopath?  You have sex.  How'd she end up in here?  I want to find that now.  One of the, uh, hardcore old school listeners will give us the complete story.  See, at this point, listeners know way more about our show than us.  Yeah.  Who was the chick that came in? 
[00:21:30]  She would drape herself in Christmas lights.  She was completely out of her mind.  Oh, was that the chick that hit me?  Yeah, you got hit.  Yeah, yeah.  With a phone book or something.  But that wasn't the, was that the first girl?  Didn't we have two girls that used to blow guys in the, doing Shakespeare in the park?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The listeners will figure it out for us.  We might need that to write the book.  So, she had Christmas lights, and I, I, I said something about her, something derogatory,  and she started, like, beating me up. 
[00:22:00]  Anyone?  No one has the story yet?  No, no.  Fuck!  That's, uh, that's a bad one.  And someone I wanted to go to, just hung up.  They said that, uh, the show has way better episodes than the one we just showed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I, I've, I've seen probably five or six of them.  I would love to know what, what they're all about, because what we just saw is impossible.  But they're making believe it is possible.  But they're superheroes who could do things that normal people just could never do. 
[00:22:30]  If you're a sharpshooter, your trajectory could be the exact same every time.  So now the samurai guy's like, okay, I just gotta swing this fucking thing in this plane.  Right.  They're obviously not going to get it on the first take, but, but now all he has to do  is do it enough, and he's eventually going to hit it.  And just nick the thing, and then it's like, oh, he's super shimmy.  Because you've got a sharpshooter, and then you've got a guy with a samurai that knows  exactly what the fuck he's doing.  Yeah.  Because that's what he does for a living, is just, like, cut oranges in half, or whatever  the fuck he does. 
[00:23:00]  That old gag.  Exactly.  That's it, Jimmy?  I thought you'd have a whole bunch of stories from your birthday.  No, I didn't, uh, I didn't do much.  I mean, I went to the party, it was a huge party, because the show was at the Beacon.  Nice.  And the party was at the Museum of Natural History.  Nice.  It was fucking massive.  Why would they do it there?  We were both at museums last night?  Yeah, I thought of that when I was walking in.  This show's weird.  Two out of the three guys were at museums last night.  I love the Museum of Natural History.  I snapped a photo when I was walking in, but they grabbed Dice for an interview. 
[00:23:30]  I was talking to Dice, and they grabbed him for an interview, and I just walked in, and  I had been, you know, Dom, who came in from, he played Hurricane on The Wire?  Of course.  He's a good friend of mine, so I see him, and we were talking, and they, I just lost him  too.  Oh, yeah.  And I just, I didn't want to.  Were you by yourself, just wandering around?  I was alone.  I went to the thing alone last night.  I'm fucking awful.  Did you walk around the museum?  No.  You couldn't really.  Oh, you couldn't?  But I don't, uh.  Can you see the dinosaurs?  I, I, they really, they were.  The big whale? 
[00:24:00]  The blue whale?  The blue whale, right?  This is actually taken right under the blue whale, I think.  Can you see that?  How many people were there?  Oh, yeah.  That's the blue whale.  That's the blue whale area.  It's a fucking manhouse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, I don't know any of the guys from the show.  So you were just kind of there, milling about.  Trying to get photographs.  It was too crowded, but I didn't even care.  Honestly, I saw what Patrick Stewart was doing.  I actually could have waited for him, but I was like, ugh, who gives a fuck?  And what was he doing there?  I guess he's, you know, who knows?  A lot of people just go to these things.  Just hump, hump.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, just want to be seen.  I don't know.  Maybe he's, maybe he's a fan of the show.  Place to be seen.  I just didn't care that much, to be honest.  Well, ask Stan Lee if this show of his is fake, or if there's a lot of trickery.  Oh, he will never admit to it.  Why not?  Oh, here's the guy.  He called back.  He's trying to defend this show.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Phil, this show sounds like it's a big setup, sir.  Phil?  I don't know, guys.  I'm a big fan of the show.  The one, the samurai bit, that episode, I wasn't really a big fan of, but you guys got  to check out Aquaman. 
[00:25:00]  This guy was amazing.  Apparently, he was able to switch between the aerobic and anaerobic system.  And once it hit about 80%, or something around there, it kind of just leveled off, where  his, you know, his oxygen was able to stay at that level.  And he was holding his breath for like five minutes before he came up, and it looked like  he was able to go longer.  The other thing he was able to do is...  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:25:30]  Stop.  Thank you.  Stop.  If he was able to go longer, he would have went longer for the TV show.  He's superhuman.  This is the other thing he did for that one.  They dropped him underwater.  And, you know, obviously, the steeper you go down, pressure, you know, hits the body.  And a human can only go down so far underwater.  Apparently, this is what the claim was.  He was able to go down further than most humans, because he was able to actually take water  in through his nose and expel it out his ears to equalize... 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God.  This show is such a fucking...  Oh, my God.  I can hold my breath a long time, too.  As long as there's balls on my chin.  Stan Lee's a carny, man.  This show is a fake.  I'm telling you, guys can hold their breath for a really long time underwater, and they  go to deep depths.  There's a whole sport that revolves around that.  So, I mean, but to say the guy can take water into his what?  They say he claims he was able to take water in through his nose and push it through his 
[00:26:30]  ears to equalize pressure.  I don't know if that's a technique for these guys that do freediving.  No!  He can't breathe in through the nose.  It's called drowning.  But to equalize his ears, I don't know.  I don't know if that's a technique that other guys could do.  I don't know.  No!  I don't know, but I mean...  I'm glad we're talking about this show.  This show's all fake.  Oh, it's just trickery.  It was pretty...  I mean, I don't know.  There's a couple other episodes.  Some guy who was, like, an amazing climber, and they compared him to how, like, certain 
[00:27:00]  monkeys have, like, more...  Like, they have better strength in their hands, and he was able to, like, you know, make this,  like, his strength-to-weight ratio was so much more than most humans.  He was able to be, like, this amazing climber where, like, he can climb these sheer walls  that only these certain monkeys in this area can do.  Oh, please.  It's a rock climber.  Some of them are really good.  They feel no offense, but you get a lot of, uh, bullshit coming in.  This guy's just probably hyperventilates and has a great lung capacity, and... 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  And then there's other people that just...  It's not superhuman.  It's just fucking people that...  This is a sport where these guys...  Have slight little differences.  I don't know what the world record is right now, but it is a sport where they have the  rope, and the guy goes down as far as he possibly can.  Yeah.  And he's got to do it in such a way to allow enough time to get back up to the surface.  Yes.  One breath of air, obviously, but it's a whole technique where they slow down their heart  rate and everything through meditation.  Yeah.  And, uh, all sorts of breathing exercises. 
[00:28:00]  They hyperventilate to really oxygenate the blood before they go down there.  There was one other guy in this other episode.  He was able to actually take metal objects, and, like, it's almost like, I don't know what  they call it, uh, telekinesis, or whenever you can, like, actually move an object with  your mind.  No, he could not move a thing with his mind.  He was able to put his head on a metal object with no hands, lift it up, and it would stick  to his forehead.  You know what's fucked up?  I could take a metal spoon and stick it to my nose, and sit there with it just hanging 
[00:28:30]  from my nose.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It impresses people from three to, uh, six years old.  Is Stan Lee pulling a rabbit out of his hat, too?  Yeah.  He's got a whole show.  He's pulling a rabbit out of my head.  He's got a whole show that revolves around magic tricks.  Uh, I don't know.  Good for him, I guess.  It's a pretty good fucking trick, then.  I don't know.  It had me going, but I'm punching out, guys.  Thanks.  I wonder why shows like this, when I watch them, I'm like, why is that still on? 
[00:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  And the caller just proved why.  There's an audience for it.  Because there are what we call rubes up there.  But I would watch a show like that, and I think there's a bunch of others, like myself,  that want to figure out how they did it.  Yeah.  If they're using CGI, what kind of trickery's going on.  He traveled to India to see a man who could actually not be affected by electricity.  They've hooked up, like, wires to him and plugged it in and had, like, an ammeter. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And we saw the amount of electricity surging through his body that would kill a normal man.  But he was absolutely fine.  Because he was superhuman.  Superhuman.  Can we see the diving episode now?  That's that one.  Are these quick little vignettes?  Yeah, they are pretty quick.  Is this a vignette, Sam?  I would call it a vignette.  Let's go with a vignette.  Vignette.  I love vignette on my salad.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  He's about to dive deeper than the recommended safety.  Can you turn up your volume, possibly?  Because I'm a little low over here. 
[00:30:00]  There'll be no way to get air to it.  I'm quite low over here.  So, I mean, there's no question about it.  His life is at risk.  There's nobody there that can save us down there, 200 meters deep.  There's no doubt.  His life is not at risk, you fucking asshole.  I saw a fucking aqualong down there.  His life is not at risk.  You said that?  Yeah.  This guy obviously does this for a living and probably competes in this sport.  Oh, maybe he can't just hold his breath for a long time.  Yeah, of course.  For a long time.  It's a weird sport. 
[00:30:30]  I think 10 fucking idiots do this around the world.  They get together every once in a while and go, okay, how far could you dive?  Yeah, two guys just drown in fucking three feet of water trying to do it.  In heart attacks, right?  Yeah, they're just trying to outdo each other, I guess, looking over and going, ah, I'm going  to hold a little longer, a little longer.  Oh, oops.  Yeah, could you still go back and forth underwater in a pool?  Oh, yeah.  I could still go back and forth.  I do that all the time.  I'm getting older.  In my pool.  But I get distracted because my beer is left at one end.  Well, that's why you have to get back to the other end.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  You touch that wall, you kick off, and you try to make it to the other side.  Well, I touch the wall with my face is what I do.  Very hard.  So it's hard to kick off.  And then I bleed like a stuck pig, and I laugh, and I drink more.  There you go.  All right.  Let's point out all the bullshit in this episode.  The guy is not in danger.  This guy knows exactly what he's doing and what his limits are.  Instead of danger, can we say danger?  Danger.  Danger.  And I wouldn't be surprised if there was some kind of diver nearby outside the camera range 
[00:31:30]  just in case the guy was in some kind of trouble.  A fucking tank with him.  Okay.  It's very, very harrowing.  There'll be no way to get air to him.  So, I mean, there's no question about it.  His life is at risk.  Yeah, there's nobody there that can save him down there 200 meters deep.  There's no diaper with him.  So if the balloon doesn't work, you can't make it back.  If the balloon doesn't work.  He fills his lungs with as much oxygen as possible. 
[00:32:00]  He's going through his techniques.  I wish I could breathe like that.  There he goes.  He's off.  I can still see him just a little bit.  Can you stop that?  He's going down.  I love that.  So he has a balloon that he's going to fill up because he has a tank with him.  Yeah, he's got a tank.  But he has no oxygen?  What do you think's in the tank?  The giant tank is there to fill the balloon up to bring him back to the surface.  And also give him a breath, God forbid, if he needs it. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, because instead of this little CO2 cartridge that would fill that, he has a giant scuba diving tank.  Pretty much.  Just to fill the bag up to get him up.  Just in case.  Who's watching this shit?  I could never breathe that deep.  That makes me feel I can't breathe.  Oh, yeah.  You would never be able to go diving.  Let's all hold our breath.  No, I can't.  I think my lungs are fucked up.  Diving rules.  You should try it.  I'm worried about my lungs.  If you get past being claustrophobic, it's amazing. 
[00:33:00]  I'm not claustrophobic.  Oh, you're not?  Then you should try it.  I don't know if I am or not.  Go on vacation.  No.  And go.  How could you be claustrophobic?  The ocean's huge.  Believe me.  You don't even have to.  I'm not afraid of claustrophobic.  You're in your little space down there.  Trust me.  Something goes on.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  All right.  He's out of sight now.  Out of sight.  At these depths, the atmospheric pressure is a crushing 300 pounds per square inch.  This will squeeze his lungs down to the size of an orange. 
[00:33:30]  True.  All right.  I feel the stock.  He's at the bottom of the line.  Why is he filling in with his toes?  He could run out of oxygen in a second.  Now the balloon is filled with lovely oxygen.  But he's not out of danger yet.  He's still at risk while he's coming up?  Definitely.  Because then he's used up all the storage, stored oxygen.  And the oxygen tension is so low that it passes out.  It's only two or three meters under the surface. 
[00:34:00]  Music.  He's breathing all those bubbles in.  I see the sled, but I don't see him.  Oh, he's dead.  Okay, cool.  Cool.  Oh, boy, he's not up.  He didn't make it.  He didn't make it, obviously.  So now that's the dramatic.  Here he is.  Yes.  Patrick is so confident in his abilities, he chose to swim back to the surface.  Ah, he's crazy.  You seem completely composed.  I mean, you have a smile on your face.  You're not even gasping.  Gasping. 
[00:34:30]  Gasping.  Crandall.  There's just a ride that you can just enjoy.  So, doctor, have you ever seen anything like Patrick before?  No.  I mean, he can shift from aerobic to anaerobic.  There's only a few people in the world that can do this.  So why is he a superhero?  To know that I'm able to do things that people can't is something that's really thrilling and motivate me to push me.  Oh, yeah, that's quite an accomplishment.  This show sucks.  That's terrible.  Tell Stanley his show sucks.  They said I'm just lighting up a Marlboro when he gets out. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, I love this.  This is fucking horse shite.  What did that guy say?  Where was the part about breathing water in and fucking pushing out his ears or whatever the guy was saying?  I guess that was more horse shit to fill up the rest of the show.  Stanley Super Super.  Can we play the Honey Badger today?  Have we overplayed that?  Honey Badger.  Maybe into break. 
[00:35:30]  Can we play the Honey Badger?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Hugo.  Looks like.  What's up, brother?  Hey, I've seen this one episode.  Uh, the host actually sucked an armadillo through a PVC pipe.  It's pretty fucking wild.  That's pretty funny.  Armadillo.  Punching out.  Yeah, why'd you do that?  It wasn't that bad.  No, it wasn't.  Does anybody off the subject know where Rupert Murdoch is from?  Yeah, he's from Australia.  Is he Australian?  I think so, yeah.  He speaks with an accent? 
[00:36:00]  I think so, yeah.  I don't know why I thought he was American.  No.  He got a pie in the face yesterday by some comedian that no one has heard of or will hear of after this goes away.  Try to slap the guy.  I'm interested in his chick.  She's like, in her heels, she's 6'4".  I know.  Wendy Dang.  Does that turn you on?  I think she's pretty and I guarantee you she's dominant, which is probably what he likes about her.  I hate when girls are taller than me.  Oh, I like that.  I fucking hate it.  Really?  I don't have much choice.  That's what happens when they throw their damn heels on.  Trust me, I got some fucking height. 
[00:36:30]  My girlfriend used to grab things in the shelf that I couldn't reach.  I could never be that guy.  That's cute.  I didn't mind.  I'd be like, get that for me.  That's cute.  I'm not saying my way is the right way, but I can never be that guy.  No?  No, man.  I have to be taller.  Oh, I don't mind.  I just have to be.  I like being a little shorter because my arm is over the ass ridge.  Really?  Yeah, man.  In heels, my chick's taller than me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Giant heels.  That's what I'm getting at.  My girl, too, man.  When she puts those heels on, it gets really close. 
[00:37:00]  Without heels, it's close.  Yeah.  With heels, it's over, Johnny.  Yeah, I can't.  I don't give a shit.  You don't care if she's taller?  Don't give a shit.  I want to hear him talk, Rupert Murdoch.  I've never heard him speak.  I know everybody's...  What do you think of the pie incident?  That's crazy stuff, isn't it?  The guy said something about you're a naughty billionaire, but...  The pie thing's pretty popular.  It's been done a lot.  They just showed a montage of all the people in pies.  It's insulting.  The best one ever was Bill Gates.  It is degrading.  Yeah.  The Bill Gates one was the best. 
[00:37:30]  Bill Gates walked right into it as the guy just...  His arm came around full blast.  Smashed him in the face.  Right.  That was good.  Let me say hi to Grant in Atlanta as we try to find Rupert Murdoch.  What's he, Grant?  Actually, we got a fucking commercial we got to get through first, so we'll go to Grant  first.  Grant?  Yeah.  Opie, you ought to know about that underwater thing because you're a scuba diver.  So when you go down and you pinch your nose to clear your association to equalize the  pressure, air bubbles don't come out of your ear, do they? 
[00:38:00]  Of course not.  I called bullshit on that.  I know how to equalize my ears when I'm diving and all that, and certainly he went through  that.  And it is true that your lungs actually get a lot smaller as you go down.  Yes.  But dude, he's saying...  See, what this guy's going is he's equalizing the pressure, so he's assuming it's got to  be water that goes from your nose to your ears, but nothing's going past your fucking  eardrum.  Well, like this guy said, you're just pushing air behind your eardrum to equalize the pressure 
[00:38:30]  that's pushing in on the other side.  Right.  So you're not shoving water or air out your fucking ears, you nut.  That's why this guy said, you know, you don't get air bubbles coming out of your ears.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course, Grant.  You could do that, though.  I could do that.  Of course, Grant.  Oh, you can?  I can stay underwater for like six minutes.  Six?  That's a long time.  Thank you, sir.  You want to hear Rupert Murdoch?  Yeah, I've never heard him speak.  Appreciate it, sir.  Fine.  Good afternoon.  The story that's seen is really buzzing all around the country, and certainly here in  New York, is that the News of the World, a news corporation newspaper in Britain, used... 
[00:39:00]  I'm not talking about that issue at all today.  I'm sorry.  Okay?  No worries, Mr. Chairman.  That's fine with me.  Sorry.  I know.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What's this guy?  I'm not a real journalist.  Quiet, man!  Don't say anything.  That was funny for a second.  Relax.  I know.  You're going to choke about it today. 
[00:39:30]  I got bitter things.  Bigger fish to fry.  But he's like, oh, sorry, Mr. Chairman.  Yeah, he probably should have been a little bit more reporter-like.  Yeah.  Oh, I wouldn't fuck with him either.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Yeah, he's pretty powerful.  Everyone got their food?  You want to take a break so we can eat?  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to eat.  We might do Honey Badger to break, I'm thinking.  Why not?  All right, we'll play this.  Oh, we'll be playing it from you.  Yep.  All right.  And we'll do something else.  Stay there.  This is the Honey Badger.  Watch it run in slow motion. 
[00:40:00]  It's pretty badass.  Look.  It runs all over the place.  Whoa, watch out, says that bird.  Ew, it's got a snake.  Oh, it's chasing a jackal.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, the Honey Badgers are just crazy.  The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records  as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.  It really doesn't give a shit.  If it's hungry, it's hungry.  Ew, what's that in its mouth?  Oh, it's got a cobra.  Oh, it runs backwards.  Now, watch this. 
[00:40:30]  Look, a snake's up in the tree.  Honey Badger don't care.  Honey Badger don't give a shit.  It just takes what it wants.  Whenever it's hungry, it just, ew, and it eats snakes.  Oh, my God.  Watch it dig.  Look at that digging.  The Honey Badger is really pretty badass.  They have no regard for any other animal whatsoever.  Look, and it's just grunting and, ew, eating snakes.  Ew, what's that, a mouse?  Oh, that's nasty.  Oh, they're so nasty.  Ooh, look, it's chasing things and eating them.  The Honey Badgers have a fairly long body, but a distinctly thick set, broad shoulders, 
[00:41:00]  and, you know, their skin is loose, allowing them to move about freely.  And they twist around.  Now, look, here's a house full of bees.  You think the Honey Badger cares?  It doesn't give a shit.  It goes right into the house of bees to get some larva.  How disgusting is that?  It eats larva.  Ew, that's so nasty.  But look, the Honey Badger doesn't care.  It's getting stung like a thousand times.  It doesn't give a shit.  It just, it's hungry.  It doesn't care about being stung by bees. 
[00:41:30]  Nothing can stop the Honey Badger when it's hungry.  Oh, what a crazy fuck.  Look.  Ew, it's eating larva.  That's disgusting.  There it is, running in slow motion again.  See?  Now, what's interesting is that other animals, like these birds here, they just like to wait  around until the Honey Badger's done eating, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps.  It says, you do all the work for us, Honey Badger, and we'll just eat whatever you find.  How's that?  What do you say, stupid?  Look at this bird.  Thanks for the treat, stupid. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, come back here, says the Honey Badger.  Birds don't care.  And you know what?  The jackals do it, too.  Look at these little dogs.  They're like, thanks, stupid.  Thanks for the mouse.  See you later.  The Honey Badger does all the work while these other animals just pick up the scraps.  At nighttime, the Honey Badger goes hunting because it's hungry.  Look.  Here comes a fierce battle between a king cobra and a Honey Badger.  I wonder what'll happen.  Look at this.  There's the Honey Badger just eating a mouse.  And then look.  Get away from me, says the snake. 
[00:42:30]  Get away from me.  Honey Badger don't care.  Honey Badger smacks the shit out of it.  And the snake comes back and it lashes right at the Honey Badger.  Oh, little does the Honey Badger know, FYI, it's been stung.  It's been bitten by the snake.  So while it's eating the snake, ew, that's disgusting.  Meanwhile, the poisonous venom is seeping through the Honey Badger's body.  And it passes out.  Look at that sleepy fuck.  Now, the Honey Badger's just gonna pass out for a few minutes.  And then it's gonna get right back up and start eating all over again. 
[00:43:00]  Cause it's a hungry little bastard.  Look at this.  Like nothing happened.  The Honey Badger gets right back up and continues eating the cobra.  How disgusting.  And of course, what does the Honey Badger have to eat for the next three weeks?  Cobra.  The Honey Badger.  I'm super.  Thanks for asking.  All things considered, I couldn't be better, I must say.  I'm feeling super.  No, nothing bugs me.  Everything is super when you're...  Don't you think I look cute in this hat? 
[00:43:30]  I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple.  But I just can't feel too bad for you right now.  Because I'm feeling so insanely super.  That even the fact that you can't walk can't bring me down.  He's super.  Thanks for asking.  All things considered, he couldn't be better, he must say.  I'm super.  No, nothing bugs me.  Everything is super when you're dope.  You think I look cute in this hat.  These little pants and a smashing tie that I got in my arm. 
[00:44:00]  I'm super.  He's in the barracks and the trenches as well.  Stick him up.  P.K.L. says to us in town.  Get him.  He can't stay super and he's about to be late.  Okay.  Everything is super when you're gay.  When you're gay.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  It's the only entity show. 
[00:44:30]  Let's go.  Hey.  Oh.  Let's go.  Hey.  Oh.  Let's go.  Hey.  Oh.  Let's go.  Oh, happy birthday to Joey Ramone. 
[00:45:00]  He's 37 years old today.  Is he?  Yeah.  How's he doing?  Doing all right.  Him and Brutus DeBarber Beefcake.  What?  He became the lead singer 37 years ago today?  Ah.  Is that why we're playing this?  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  53,000 employees. 
[00:45:30]  Like, I was just thinking as I was coming back.  What happened?  Like, Rupert Murdoch.  Oh, okay.  I was thinking of Mel.  Like, he's our boss.  He's a big boss.  And he runs Sirius.  And Viacom, he's a big boss.  And he's a big CEO.  And then you look at a guy like Murdoch, who has, what, fucking 30 or 40 Mel's working for him?  Like, that's the level of CEO he is.  Like, he has 30 or 40 company heads.  Fucking 53,000 employees.  Wow.  That's a lot.  That's a lot of people working for you.  There's going to be quite a few sacrificial lambs in this whole fucking hacking thing. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Fuck.  I don't think his head's going to roll.  I believe that he didn't know.  I don't think that you call the guy who runs all that and you go, hey, look, we're listening in.  You probably just don't ask.  You don't even think to ask.  Depends how far this goes.  Because it gets to a point where, all right, let's switch out guys just to calm everybody down.  Maybe, yeah.  You know, that's sort of what happened to us on a much lower level.  Much lower.  Oh, I know.  I'm not even trying to front.  But after a while, it becomes, all right, let's get rid of these fucking guys and control, you know, and calm everyone down. 
[00:46:30]  And he might be looking at that on a way higher level because it shuts everybody up, right?  Yeah.  Changes the story.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Philadelphia.  Flair.  The city of brotherly love.  So they say.  This fucking thing they're attempting is just mind-numbing.  Yeah.  Because it's right in our wheelhouse.  We're sick and tired of the politicians and government and what have you trying to get more fucking money from our pockets. 
[00:47:00]  Especially under the guise that it's helping you in some way.  They're not even trying to.  Now they're not even trying to say that.  No.  Oh, and quickly, because I'm sure you heard it on the way in because we listened to the same news program.  Yes.  Did you hear about the Tappan Zee Bridge?  Yes.  There was a time in this country where they made, they just built incredible things.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  And if you really think about it, we don't build incredible things anymore.  Maybe a tall building here and there.  Yeah.  But no massive, like, bridge projects or.  Big dams.  Or dams, very good.  Or, I don't know, big tunnels here and there.  Sure, the big dig.  Yeah.  But in general, you just don't see those big projects anymore.  Know why?  It costs way too fucking much money.  Too much money.  And that's because of the greed and fucking redundant levels of management.  They want to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And I would assume a bunch of this money would come out of our pockets, right?  Oh, hells yeah.  And for the people out of town, the Tappan Zee Bridge, what, it connects New York to?  To, like, upstate.  Oh, yeah.  When you're going upstate, you've got to take it.  You've got to get over that river.  The Hudson River?  You've got to get over the Hudson.  Is it the Hudson River?  Yeah.  Way the fuck up there, right?  Yeah.  To cross over?  Yeah, it's into Nyack.  In Nyack.  It's way.  Nyack.  It's north of here, certainly.  Yeah.  And they want to replace it.  They've been wanting to replace this for years.  And, well, they've decided that it's going to cost, and I swear to you, I would imagine 
[00:48:30]  that it would cost only $9 million.  Why not?  Why not?  You get some steel.  Why not?  If you guys there know how to put a bridge together.  But, of course, I'm the crazy guy, because it's going to actually cost $9 billion to rebuild  the Tappan Zee Bridge.  And no one is outraged by this.  And they go, yeah, of course, that's what things cost now.  $9 billion.  And if they want to put a commuter rail in, it's going to be $16 billion. 
[00:49:00]  $16 billion.  $16 billion?  So an extra $7 billion just so there's a choo-choo that goes across it.  So a choo-choo can drive.  A choo-choo.  And no one is outraged by this, and we all just go with it, like, oh, yeah, that's what  it costs.  How does a bridge cost $9 billion?  How does that bridge cost $100 million every year to maintain, and it's falling apart?  They spend $100 million on that bridge every year, and it's fucking falling apart. 
[00:49:30]  That's a long bridge, but it's still, just build a new fucking bridge.  But $100 million, where's that money going?  What do they use $100 million for?  A lot of paint.  You don't need to paint the fucking thing.  Kind of let a fish bodies out.  Jesus.  Why does it cost $100 million to maintain it, and it's still falling apart?  I guess rust maintenance, and, you know, they have to paint it to keep the rust.  Yeah.  And then the road surface.  What's that thing that moves the lane?  The zipper.  The zipper?  Yeah.  That's a pretty amazing little piece of equipment.  Whoever invented that's a genius. 
[00:50:00]  That thing is the bane of my existence when I come out of the Midtown Tunnel.  Because if the timing isn't right, I could see that thing as I'm going through the tolls coming my way, and then they shut down all the lanes, all the dumb fucking toll guys come out, shut all the lanes down, and you have to wait for this fucking zipper rig that I think the top speed is .1 mile an hour for it to go across all the lanes. 
[00:50:30]  And then get out of the way, and then you can continue your drive.  So a lot of times when I'm going through, I see this thing coming, and it's at the end of the zipper, and I'm like, oh, fuck.  I go, I've had that gate actually touch my windshield.  Yeah, just so.  Because I see the guy walking out, and it's like, they're going to stop traffic.  I ain't waiting.  How long does it take?  Eh, like a minute.  Let me ask.  How long of a length does the zipper thing go, and how long does it take to do it? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, it's fast.  The thing is really fast.  It's a few miles, right?  It's, yeah, it goes from about Van Dam around there somewhere.  Up to the Midtown Tunnel.  That's about two miles, I would guess.  Yeah, a couple of miles.  They get it done pretty quick.  Those fucking big cement things just moving over, zipping right on.  So it gives you an extra lane coming.  What a brilliant fucking person thought of that. 
[00:51:30]  God damn it, that's smart.  I already said thank you.  No, I know, but I just.  That thing drives all wacky.  It's sideways.  It's driving sideways.  Why do we question this shit?  Why does it cost so much money?  Someone explain that to me logically, where I would actually go, oh, okay, now I understand.  Nothing should cost $9 billion.  From beginning to end, you're talking the engineers, you're talking environmental people.  Everyone getting their fucking mitts involved.  Getting their mitts involved. 
[00:52:00]  Then the demolition of the old bridge, I'm sure.  And then, you know how much the unions get?  The pile driving unions, the steel workers.  It's crazy.  So if someone suggested, okay, we could build this bridge for $1 billion, people actually said that you're crazy, right?  Yeah.  $9 billion.  $9 billion.  You understand?  That's crazy.  It's unbelievable.  Someone is telling me, thank you, Carolina man.  Empire State Building, you want to guess how much it cost in 1930? 
[00:52:30]  Granted, it's 1930 money.  Ah, yes.  But maybe we could do some figuring and figure out what it would be.  Certainly.  In today's case.  $25 million.  $25 million for the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I bet you that thing, you couldn't even touch it for, what, billions, right?  When it opened in 55, the original Tappan's, it cost about $80.8 million.  Okay.  So in 55 years, now that's going to cost $9 billion? 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  You got to allow for inflation a little bit, but that's ridiculous.  That's like gum being $2,000.  Right.  Yes.  Ah, whatever.  What do we fucking know?  I think, you know, and you can't even get into the union argument because union guys are like,  yeah, union, you know, union kept me working.  The union pays this.  The union does that.  Yeah, it was a great idea years ago.  It's another, it's just another good thing that got corrupted over the years. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  And that's, and you can cry all you want about jobs being taken overseas, but, you know,  when some fucking guy that's, that's using a machine to put lug nuts on a car in Detroit  is getting $50, $60 an hour, sorry, they're going out to a place where they could pay that  guy $10 an hour.  Well, you could get the chinkies involved.  Right.  They'll do it for rice. 
[00:54:00]  Exactly.  It's fantastic.  Was that real racist?  It really, yeah.  But it's, uh, yeah, that was pretty racist.  Uh, Aaron Campbell writes, it's the true coat, Anthony.  It's the true coat.  Oh, you got to get the true coat.  You got to have the true coat.  Well, I've never seen him do this before.  He's going to knock a hundred dollars off that true coat.  I've never seen him do this before.  You're a fucking liar.  I think it goes a lot deeper than unions, by the way.  I think there's a lot of horseshit involved when you decide to rebuild a bridge in this 
[00:54:30]  day and age.  Money's allocated, and then it goes into people's pockets that have nothing to do with the bridge.  Yeah.  Politicians get it.  Their, their, uh, uh, districts get all kinds of fucking kickback money to allow certain  things.  It's fucking, it's the mob.  It's the legalized mob, especially this, uh, smaller end of the government, not so much,  and the federal government too.  But when you get these little projects like this, oh, it's fucking crazy. 
[00:55:00]  That's why I, I always loved the mob and didn't mind, um, you know, mingling a little  bit with the mob.  They always treated me right.  Whatever.  And you realize that they weren't doing anything different than what the fucking, uh, legit  people were doing.  Yeah.  Doing exactly the same thing.  Shaking people down.  The, uh, the Tappan Z is also a weird bridge because, uh, there's so much traffic on the  Hudson.  Of course, shipping traffic. 
[00:55:30]  It's really weird to drive your car in the Hudson.  Sure.  That they need to make it so high to get those ships underneath it.  They can't make a drawbridge because they can't stop the fucking traffic flow for every ship  that's going.  So it's a weird bridge.  It's very, very high in the middle.  How long is it?  It's about a mile and a half.  A long time.  It's been there since 55.  It's not a mile and a half.  It's a mile and a half.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I just, uh, measured it the other day.  See?  That's a mile and a half.  You measured it?  See, so they can't, like, uh, uh, they, it's a very odd bridge. 
[00:56:00]  But nine billion worth of odd?  No.  No.  Yeah.  Nine billion.  You can't even, could you even write that number down?  Uh, yeah.  It's like a nine.  Is it, is it a million with three zeros?  Nine zeros.  Nine million.  And then you put three more zeros.  Three more zeros, right?  Three more zeros.  Nine.  So is this nine million?  That's nine billion right there.  That's insane. 
[00:56:30]  That's, that's, take nine million, right?  Yeah.  And then you take a thousand nine millions.  You have nine million bucks, right?  You're like, holy shit, I got nine million.  That's nice.  Uh, how much to pay for the bridge?  See that nine million?  We need you to come up with a thousand of those.  But it's nine million.  Yeah, we need a thousand.  And there's nothing we could do, right?  Nothing.  And then the tolls will go up because it's a new bridge, right?  And some taxes will go up because it's a new bridge. 
[00:57:00]  Because they only toll you as long as it takes to pay for the bridge.  That's right.  Then the tolls stop.  Really?  Back in 1950.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They said that with every bridge.  That's right.  And you're still paying tolls.  That was what was supposed to happen a long time ago.  With the Verrazano, with all of them.  Easy pass, by the way.  This is how fucking sick I am of you people out there that easy pass.  You should be forced to divert away from certain...  Like, literally, the Lincoln Tunnel should be easy pass only.  If you don't have it, you are fucking forced into a lane which takes you five miles out of your way. 
[00:57:30]  You paranoid assholes that think the government's tracking you.  But they are enough.  They are.  Stop it and just get an easy pass, you inconvenient fuckwads.  You're fucking inconveniencing everybody.  Don't you love coming out of a tunnel when there's fucking a toll booth there and you can't get out of the tunnel because of the fucking cash people blocking it?  And then the second you're able to get around, it's smooth sailing.  But they block and clog the tunnel up with their dumb cash. 
[00:58:00]  They're such assholes.  Get an easy pass, you fucking load of shit.  Literally, there's not one justifiable reason.  You should be forced to divert to another fucking way of getting there.  Yeah.  That's how inconvenient it should be for you.  Coming in six months, if you don't have it, you have to drive eight miles north.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  It's a great idea.  Inconvenience them.  And believe me, I've had easy pass for fucking probably eight years now.  And I speed like a motherfucker.  I've never gotten a speeding ticket from easy pass. 
[00:58:30]  They're not doing that.  Whether they do in the future, I can't guarantee it.  But as of right now, it's a lot more convenient to have.  Get out of the way.  Stop it.  If you get a speeding ticket.  Throwing your fucking change in a bucket or handing it to some slow motion monkey.  Fuck you.  Drives me nuts.  And by the way, when they still have cash, easy pass.  How about this?  One easy pass lane.  One cash lane out of the way.  And the rest are easy pass.  The rest are easy pass.  Because a fucking Lincoln Tunnel, when you're coming in from Jersey, the right lane is four 
[00:59:00]  to seven.  And in the morning, it's all buses only.  Well, fuck buses only.  I have easy pass.  Yeah.  So then you have a bunch of cash easy pass lanes.  And then the first easy pass lane is all the way over to the left.  It's fucking annoying.  Pain in the ass.  You've got to come out of there.  Go all the way to the left.  You've got to go through the lanes where people are waiting to pay their cash.  Roll their window down with their money.  Hi.  Well.  Can I have change?  Oh, God.  No one's rolling their window down anymore.  What?  That I can promise.  Really?  Yeah.  That's old school.  How do you pay cash without your window down? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, I thought rolling.  I just say rolling.  I don't do the universal, you know, hey, roll your window down.  Look, man, we talk to a lot of kids.  They don't understand what rolling down is.  They don't know rolling the window down?  They have no fucking idea that you used to have to actually roll it down.  I would hand it to them through the fly window.  Oh, my God.  How old are you?  The fly window.  What is the fly window?  I don't even know that.  That was before air conditioning.  Was that the little window?  That's the little triangular window where you can turn it, and it would actually scoop 
[01:00:00]  the air in and blow some cooler air on you.  The fly window.  Look, I know I shave a few years off my age.  I think you shave a decade or two off yours.  No, you remember the fly window.  I remember the little window, yes, but you remember the name of it.  Put fly window in there.  I know what you're talking about.  A pretty window's going to pop up.  A fly window.  That was your AC.  You had an angle it just right.  That was your AC, man.  You'd get a blast of nice, warm summer air in your face.  Oh, my God.  Fly window images doesn't even come up.  Why would it?  Car fly window. 
[01:00:30]  There you go.  Look all the way to the...  There it is.  That is your fly window.  Sam, you remember the fly window, right?  I've never heard of the fly window in my life.  Do you even understand rolling down your window?  Only because I drove my last Jeep still had...  Oh, okay.  See, the fly window had a little latch on it, and you would turn this latch and just push  it out, and it would turn, and you could either do it one way where it would suck air  out of your car if you angled it just barely opened, or you could turn it all the way in 
[01:01:00]  and it would funnel air into your car and cool you off.  Vans still have it.  Vans will have it in the back.  Yes, the vans still have the fly window.  A little bit, a little bit.  Hey, this bridge thing is pissing people off.  Jake and Jersey, Verrazano...  Oh, we didn't lose that.  Fuck, man.  All right, whatever.  Verrazano's only $13, Ant.  No big deal.  It's only up $4 in the last five years.  Fuck damn.  They've raised the bridge price $4 in the last five years alone. 
[01:01:30]  $13 every day.  Yeah.  And the local politicians just assume that people could pay for that shit.  That's another bill.  That's disgusting.  That you have to worry about.  If you're a commuter, that's another bill you've got to worry about.  That's $65 a week just to go over that bridge.  That's sickening.  And, of course, there's other tolls involved, maybe parking your car.  Oh, yeah.  It's un-fucking-believable.  And these politicians, that's why I hate them all.  This is the shit they should be dealing with. 
[01:02:00]  That is the cutback that they should do to balance budgets and everything.  They're always like, well, we've got to get rid of some teachers.  We've got to get rid of nurses.  We've got to get rid of this hospital.  How about you gather up everybody that has anything to do with transportation in this city?  Yep.  Shoot them in the head.  And fucking shoot them in the head.  And you gather them up and say, what the fuck do you do?  Yep.  And make him tell you his fucking job.  And then, if there's five more people that do it, get rid of four of them. 
[01:02:30]  And tell that one guy, here's your job.  Do it.  When you're going through the tolls, you know that one guy that almost looks like he's a cop,  but he's just going...  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's just walking across the lanes, back and forth.  What does he do?  He clogs up traffic.  Yeah.  Because they never walk fast enough.  And then it gets obnoxious to you if you might be a little close to him.  But what the fuck are you doing?  The transit or the bridge and tunnel cops jurisdiction is so short in between the bridge and tunnel, 
[01:03:00]  you can do whatever the fuck you want in between there.  I peeled out...  I've left fucking gravel flying at these people, leaving the tolls.  And they, like, shake their fists.  They're like, ah!  They can't do anything.  Let me say hi to Ari.  Ari.  Ari, of course, in New York.  Ari.  Yeah, hi, what's up?  You're talking about the $9 billion estimated cost.  They're giving you the low number.  You always got to pull that number, right? 
[01:03:30]  You know what?  Yeah, we should have realized that.  Of course they don't give you the actual number ever.  They throw that number at you.  Like, I think the public could handle hearing $9 billion.  And then, you know, as time goes by, ah, we got to add a billion dollars onto the cost of this thing.  It's costing more than we realized.  Yeah, yeah.  Labor costs in Belgium went up.  Yeah, that's it.  Punch it out.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, Ari.  All right.  Let's go to John in Alabama.  John? 
[01:04:00]  Hey, I'll bet Sonny Corleone thought he wanted easy pass.  I didn't hear what you said, brother.  I'll bet Sonny Corleone...  What?  Your phone's messed up, sir.  John, John.  John, are you there?  Oh, fuck you.  John.  I want to know, because somebody wrote...  Actually, it wasn't that bad a line, actually.  It is.  No, he wrote that line years ago.  I actually made a video of him getting shot up at the toll booth, and then the easy pass logo comes in. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  If, uh...  But it said Frank Corleone.  I know.  Who said it was Frank Corleone?  See, I thought it was going to say Frank Corleone.  I was going to, really?  That would be Troy.  Troy?  Oh, Troy.  Troy, how did you not know Sonny Corleone is the guy at the toll booth?  He's out in the booth waving at Kenny about something.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, the phone server's just crashed.  We're trying to find...  Okay.  No, it didn't.  I'm answering phones right now.  You can, but we can't do it either.  Kevin in New York.  Kevin? 
[01:05:00]  Hey, man.  Kevin, you're on the air.  That's a good stat, too.  He's like, me?  All right, maybe the phones are crashed.  No, my name's Evan.  It'll be like, no, I'm Evan.  Jimmy's a Cowboys fan.  Yeah.  We're talking about the Verrazano Bridge, $9 billion, $16 billion if they put a commuter rail.  If they put a choo-choo on it.  A choo-choo.  The new Cowboy Stadium, $1 billion it costs.  That's it.  So, nine new Cowboy Stadiums.  How the fuck does that happen?  Nine of those to make this stupid bridge. 
[01:05:30]  I don't get it.  A billion sounds like a lot to me.  But now nine of those to make the one bridge.  No reason.  Holy shit.  No reason for it.  I can't hang up or anything, huh?  Oh, you're done on the phones, huh?  Oh, boy.  We're done with the phones?  And then there was a guy, unfortunately, I guess he had to go to work.  He said in California, I think they're building a bridge, I think he said.  And they're having it built somewhere else and having it shipped over because it costs so much less. 
[01:06:00]  And that's the problem, really, right?  There you go, put it on a big barge, send it over, drop it in place.  Send it over in pieces because they're building it cheaper over there.  I'd say they build those big oil platforms and everything.  Yeah.  Build it in one spot.  Cruise ship.  I saw how they build this fucking cruise ship.  And where they build it, the ships have to go under a bridge.  And the fucking cruise ship could not make it under with its smokestacks the way it is.  So just for the one trip out of the construction dock and across the ocean, they made the smokestacks on hydraulics where they actually go down into the ship. 
[01:06:30]  And then they go under the bridge, back up, and that's the only time they'll ever do that.  Wow.  And you know what it must have caused to make the stacks do that?  I can't even imagine.  It's crazy.  People love their cruise ships, though.  And I guess the Queen Mary 2. 
[01:07:00]  The stacks go down?  Yeah.  I'm processing that.  Yeah.  I know.  And the Queen Mary 2, they had to make the stacks shorter than they wanted to so it could get under the Verrazano.  Because, you know, always coming into New York.  I saw a video where you saw the, it was about a year or two ago, where the Queen Mary 2, I think it was, was going under the Verrazano.  Or one of the bridges.  They got to wait for, like, the tide to go down to the right.  I mean, they had feet.  It was about three feet.  I think it was like, yeah, just a few feet. 
[01:07:30]  And when you look at a three-foot difference, even.  If you can find that video, it's pretty amazing.  It looks like inches when they show that.  They only had about three feet to spare where this thing was going to scrape the bottom of the bridge.  Can you imagine?  What do the stacks do?  Do they need them?  I think they, yeah, they probably do.  That's where all the exhaust goes, so you're not sitting on the deck breathing in smoke.  It's got to be at a very high point on the ship.  It's got to push it above everybody.  And it's everything.  It's the exhaust from the engines, from the power creating generators and turbines. 
[01:08:00]  Under the Golden Gate.  Oh, it's under the Golden Gate?  Is that it?  Because I know the Verrazano one is real fucking cool.  Sure, let's play this one.  I think I saw it with the New York Bridge, but that's fine.  I bet that's nothing, the Golden Gate.  I bet it goes under with nary a problem.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to play that there, Sam?  No, it's playing.  Oh, it's an 18 fucking mile away shot.  Oh, really?  Don't forget it.  Why, he zipped through it.  Get the Verrazano one. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Under the Verrazano.  I just want to see him spell Verrazano.  That's exactly why he went with Golden Gate.  Oh, my God.  He spelled it with an S.  Verrazano.  My mother used to say Verrazano.  You know, some guy actually working on there fell into the cement.  Is that true?  Don't fuck.  No.  Nah, I guess there's people on deck.  Go a little further forward.  Yeah, we don't want to do this in real time. 
[01:09:00]  I'm sure it's not speeding through like a fucking cigarette boat.  From England they started taking this video.  Yeah.  People just don't know how to make videos.  Why would this video be three minutes long?  Yeah, just get to the part where...  Now, the mast, the forward mast is just like...  Just getting under it, but the towers are the big thing.  Just clearing under.  But it's hard to say with perspective how far that's going.  Yeah, but suffice to say it's very close.  Now do they, uh... 
[01:09:30]  Well, yeah, the video's only half over, so...  What happens if you fucking smash into it?  Oh, boy, you'd have to close the bridge.  Would the ship be damaged or the bridge?  Or both?  I think both.  The ship probably more than the bridge.  Oh, this guy doesn't know how to film it.  I'm not an idiot.  This guy stinks!  God, you had a moment in time.  Now go for the, uh...  Okay, there's the stacks.  Now he's going to get the stacks going under.  Very short stacks.  Are they?  Yeah.  That's probably...  Oh, you see the shadow. 
[01:10:00]  That's fucking close, man.  All right.  Come on.  I was going to say 20 feet, but there's no way.  That's less than 10 feet.  That's fucking tight.  Wow.  But that's all he should have filmed.  Yeah, we made it.  It's a 20-second video.  We're two and a half minutes in to see the moment.  Fucking asshole.  By 16 feet, it's in.  Give it a dislike.  They're saying 16 feet?  Yeah, on the video.  It's got 10 likes and one and zero dislikes.  Finally give it one.  Give it a dislike.  You hate it because you were hoping the bridge would come down.  Oh, it'd be great.  Wow, that was pretty damn close.  Do you know what happened when that thing was in England, though? 
[01:10:30]  It was going to London Bridge?  What happened?  Started falling down.  Falling down.  Get out.  Fair lady.  Your car is here.  Get out.  Get out.  Stop it.  Get out.  Oh, boy.  Go wait in the lounge at the airport.  Please.  How could that happen, by the way, in Arizona?  What?  That's where London Bridge is now.  They took it apart. 
[01:11:00]  Did they?  They shipped it over to Arizona.  Why?  And rebuilt it in Arizona.  For what?  Why would you know that?  I don't know.  Why would you know that?  It's just as a tourist attraction.  Isn't that odd?  Get on Jeopardy, will you?  Why are you wasting all this knowledge?  Oh, that's a real video?  The oasis of the sea going under the Great Belt Bridge.  Wow, that looks like it's going to hit.  Oasis is giant.  How big is the Belt Bridge?  It's about 100 feet off the gate.  Wow, that is pretty fucking tight right there.  It looks like a cartoon.  And they have to go right under the center of the span where it's the highest. 
[01:11:30]  They've got to wait for the tide to go down.  It's really a timing issue.  And then the captain kind of winces, I guess.  Do they let the air out of the tires, too?  Yeah, they do do a thing with the ballast.  Oh, they do do something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's a certain speed that they have to maintain that actually sucks the ship down  a little bit more in the water.  Oh, wow.  Such a weird fucking thing.  You would just think, yeah, I'll drive under the bridge.  What if a wave comes and lifts it up a couple of feet? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, you would think, like, they probably know if there's any rogue waves coming.  That would suck.  Big fool rides the front of the boat up, just smashes into the top.  Or maybe on that, there's not waves strong enough at that level to lift a thing of that  size.  Oh, there's a video of a ship hitting the bridge.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Let's go to David in Canada.  David.  Ah, hey.  Hello.  Hi, Pally.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Great show.  Love it.  Of course you do.  You've got to punch up the video of the ship hitting the bridge, because Jimmy was wondering 
[01:12:30]  what happens.  It cuts the smokestacks off like a lawnmower.  What ship hitting which bridge?  Yeah.  How about you give us the name of a ship?  Yeah.  What ship?  What bridge?  HMS Bounty?  Yeah.  The Edmund Fitzgerald?  Edmund Fitzgerald.  Well, our stacks hit the bridge, and we look like some dicks.  Wow.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, that's not good.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  It fucks the bridge up, too.  Oh, my God.  It's really amazing.  That just ripped the stacks right off.  Why did that guy think it was a good idea to cross onto that bridge? 
[01:13:00]  Because the bridge goes up and down.  Oh, the bridge was going up.  The bridge was coming down when he was going through.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's like trying to tailgate somebody without an easy pass.  Hey, guys.  Can I say one more thing?  Yes.  You could say it.  I've been to New York.  I live in Canada.  If you don't have a lot of cash, living in that fucking monstrous city is fuck.  Oh, believe me, we know.  But the thing is, we do have a lot. 
[01:13:30]  How are you guys?  How are you going to go?  He's right, though.  This is a shithole.  That's crazy.  I can't wait to get out of here.  Really?  I can't wait to get the fuck out of here.  What are you talking about still?  I have no desire to leave New York.  I don't mean to leave and go a million miles away.  You can't.  There's nowhere a million miles away.  I want to go away to the point of, you're right, to the point of, if I want, I could come  into the city, but I live far enough away where I could actually afford, like, a nice 
[01:14:00]  giant place and property, and I could shoot guns on my property.  A faraway land?  A faraway land.  Well, there's people on that boat, and it's completely engulfed in flames.  Well, why wouldn't you just jump in the water at that point?  I think he's looking for people.  Oh, look.  He changed his mind.  He goes back.  Yeah.  This guy's going back into his room.  He forgot his cell phone.  What did he forget?  His cell phone.  Actually, sometimes they lay out a nice spread in your room, so maybe he wanted to snack a  little chocolate.  Take a nap real quick. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  David, what else did you have that you talked over everybody that was trying to discuss  what you were talking about?  I'm going to watch it.  I would, too, if I were you.  Sorry.  Thank you.  We're beating up all the listeners.  Scott in Connecticut.  How are you, buddy?  Squat.  Not too bad.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  See, that's why I don't even know if it was your birthday yesterday.  I have no idea.  No.  Scott, should we get a cake today just to cover our faces?  What happened there?  That's a great one.  A ship drops the anchor on a boat. 
[01:15:00]  No way.  A tugboat's pushing a ship.  Is this Caddyshack?  And the ship drops the anchor.  Hey, you scratched my anchor.  Right.  And that tugboat gets slammed.  Let me see that.  I was dealing with one of the callers.  That's a good one.  These are maritime problems.  Oh, fuck.  I think a guy fell overboard.  Of course he did.  Wow.  Yeah, that guy's just sitting there.  He gets flung right off the boat.  There he goes.  How did that not go right through the fucking boat, though? 
[01:15:30]  Scott in Connecticut, sir.  What do you got?  Hey, guys.  You're talking about the maintenance and how much it costs to go across the bridge in New York there.  The Tappan TGW, the Verrazano, all those.  Yeah.  You can kick those and double and triple those for the track and trailers going across them.  I think, I can't remember exactly what it is now because I have the easy patch for the company, but I remember going across having to pay cash.  It used to be like $30 to go across the EGW bridge, $25 and $30 to go across the Tappan TG.  That's a lot of trucks going across there every day. 
[01:16:00]  So where does all that money go?  I have no idea.  Someone's lining their pockets.  Yeah, somebody, you have to hit them in the purse strings and they'll stop it.  They're purse strings.  Who has purse strings?  When trucks are being charged $30, $40 a trip, guess who's paying for that in the end?  The goods go up.  Yes.  Does this guy think his mast is going to make it under that bridge?  Oh, my God.  Does he honestly think that giant sailing mast is not even going slow where he could go like, man? 
[01:16:30]  It might be close.  Yeah, maybe the perspective makes it look like it's not going to make it.  I'd be sure if I had a fucking...  Oh, it says collision right on top.  Yeah, we did give it a little.  Oh, wow.  He just...  Wait a minute.  He made it.  Oh, man.  He just made it.  Deceptive...  That couldn't have been more than a foot.  Maybe two feet.  Deceptive title.  Was on The Crown Princess when it tipped over. 
[01:17:00]  What's The Crown Princess?  The Crown Princess?  Doesn't he host that Stan Lee show?  No.  Different guy.  Oh, Jimmy.  There was a Crown Princess that was on fire.  Hi, John.  John?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hi, John.  Like four years ago, The Crown Princess made a voyage out of the Brooklyn Terminal in downtown  Brooklyn.  We were leaving Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
[01:17:30]  The boat was brand new.  I was outside smoking a cigarette on the deck.  The boat started going on its axis off to the side until we were on the top deck and we  were pacing down at the water.  All the pool water started flowing into the boat.  All the children are on the top deck.  They started getting hit with chairs and all kinds of crazy stuff.  It was like the side and everyone was freaking out.  They didn't call anybody, but we were only 11 miles offshore so we could still use our  phone.  Next thing you know, there was freaking helicopters, police boats, everything. 
[01:18:00]  The whole boat went over.  The captain gets on the microphone and he's telling everybody, don't worry, dinner's at  six o'clock, everything's going to be okay.  Meanwhile, everyone's gushing blood, there's water coming down into the ship, people are  getting hit with television.  The sickest thing I've ever seen.  It's like a great time.  So did he say, at one point, did he say, fellas, it's too rough to feed you?  No.  At 7 p.m., the main TV fell down.  Fellas, it's too rough to feed you.  You only had like three hours to get off. 
[01:18:30]  They asked if you wanted to leave the boat and you only had three hours because then  customs wouldn't let you off the boat.  Oh, no.  We took off and basically after a while they told everybody, get home whichever way you  can get home and then we'll reimburse you everything.  But they had to shut the ship down.  Wow.  We're watching right now a video of a crane that was trying to drop a boat in to the  water.  Oh, man.  And the crane tipped over.  Tipped over.  That boat was just a little too heavy.  Pick it up.  Put it right there where you need it, Captain. 
[01:19:00]  And the fucking boat, the crane just tipped into the water.  Is there any crane?  That's a good story, John.  Thank you.  Crane falling shit always scares me, too.  Like, I would hate to be a crane.  Crane operators deserve whatever money they get.  And this asshole's speeding up to the beach.  Yeah.  And he's an idiot.  He thought he was hitting the beach straight on.  He went a little sideways and it flung him right out of the boat.  But this looks like one of those places where you go and take your life into your hands  when you give this guy money. 
[01:19:30]  Sure.  We got the cost of what it is for a truck to cross the Verrazano Bridge.  Everyone's guessing the amount.  And Vinny's got the answer.  Vinny?  $70 for a tractor trailer to go over to Verrazano.  And it's about $65 for the George Washington, just for a tractor trailer alone.  How do they justify that?  They actually carry it for you.  Yes.  They have a bunch of people carry your truck so the wheels don't get dirty.  As the driver gets a blowjob.  It's amazing.  So commuters, $13 about. 
[01:20:00]  Trucks, up to $70.  That's a lot of money they're taking in every day.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is that money?  We're looking at a crane collapse?  I guess.  So allegedly, Sam, let's just be careful legally here.  Zip through it.  You keep going backwards.  Yeah, why are you going backwards?  What do you think?  Get to the end.  Collapse and restart?  Go to the end.  Go to the end.  What are you doing?  He's going to the beginning where the crane is standing.  It's already on the floor.  What?  Is it?  No.  Now it's collapsing, you don't look.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:20:30]  What were you looking at?  What did you think?  It was already on the floor.  You didn't see the crane in the sky?  There's a crane lifting up this big iron fucking piece.  And it wasn't collapsed.  And Sam kept going backwards.  Yeah, what a dope.  What are you trying to make it happen?  Because I wanted to see if there was any motion happening.  Yeah, when it collapsed at the end.  Yeah.  I wanted to see what caused the collapse.  See, everything in the sky is going to end up on the ground.  Yeah.  Everything you see in that blue sky area is going to end up on the ground.  It's a fucking investigation. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, I saw one thing collapse.  It was like a radio tower that they were...  You ever see when they take one top of a radio tower and they replace it at like, you  know, 1,500 feet or whatever?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And one of those fucking things collapsed and there were workers on it.  That was a horrible fucking video.  Let's go to Mikey and long gagging the day.  Gildum.  Mikey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  I want to put something in perspective.  You got to think about what happens to the bridge.  A high-rise in Manhattan, an average high-rise is like $500 million to put up. 
[01:21:30]  Like the Trump Towers.  So you got to think of it that way.  But how much more work goes into a bridge crossing the Hudson River?  Wait, you're defending this, Mike?  You can't live on a bridge.  Well, it's just the way it is with labor and everything else.  You got to think what it costs just to put a building up in Manhattan is $500 million.  But my point, and sorry, because I'll probably get people mad, but why is a building costing  a half billion dollars to put up?  Labor, everything. 
[01:22:00]  Labor.  Labor, you know, they'll, they'll, they'll, not so much labor, it's just the whole, the  whole process.  You know what?  Not even labor, material, everything that goes along with building a building in New York  City.  But I'll tell you this.  The guys that are actually building the buildings in New York City aren't really fucking, you  know, living large.  So where is that money going?  We're earning a living.  That's it.  We're earning a living.  The money's going in, you know, Trump's pocket.  I know a few of these steel workers and, you know, it's tough for them to get work.  And when they get work, they're not fucking living large. 
[01:22:30]  The life of Riley.  Where's the fuck is all that money going?  It's just the cost of doing business in New York City.  See, no one has the answers, Mike.  No one ever has the answers.  Now Sam is just looking at world's dumbest criminal videos.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  How about we find a crane collapse with people on it?  Well, this started with the Philadelphia story, believe it or not.  But AIDS?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we could do the story after the break.  The texting story is just driving me fucking batshit.  Yeah.  More money.  How much fucking money are they going to rip out of our pockets? 
[01:23:00]  And how do you dictate that?  Like, it's...  Is this a fake story?  What's the criteria?  This isn't fake, right?  For a ticket.  Yeah.  Is it jaywalking while you're texting?  I don't know.  We're going to find out next.  Because it's not just texting.  There is a certain thing.  More to this.  Yes.  You could walk down the street and text.  But it's something, if you're not paying attention to your walking. 
[01:23:30]  What are you paying attention to?  Who determines that?  Who's judging that?  Where's the safety issue?  Yeah.  Well, they don't want you walking out into traffic while you're texting.  But that's not their fucking problem.  But how about your...  Maybe you lose one or two every year.  Who gives a fuck?  But how about you're not texting and you walk out into traffic?  I see it all the time.  Yeah.  People are idiots.  All right.  We're going to get into this story after the break.  Constantly honking at those idiots.  We're going to see exactly what's going on in Philadelphia.  Because here's the problem.  If they do it in Philly, it's going to be in every fucking city in America.  Because they're all copyrights. 
[01:24:00]  Graphic images.  San Francisco police gunned down man skipping bus fare.  Oh, you didn't hear about this story?  No.  I want to see that.  All right.  We'll do that as well.  We've got a couple things to do after the break.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Samuel L. Jackson.  Hey, this is Sean William Scott.  Okay.  Hey, this is Seth Rogen.  This is John Heater.  You're listening to Open E.  I suck at liners, by the way.  Hey, everybody.  This is William Shatner.  You're listening to Open E.  And Anthony. 
[01:24:30]  Morning, everybody.  I hope you're having a good morning.  Ah.  Morning, early birds.  See that commercial?  Oh, God.  I hate that one.  Hey, um.  She's all chipper in the morning.  What's that?  I guess we've got to apologize for Fez. 
[01:25:00]  Fez Watley.  What happened?  Oh, I didn't do it.  What?  Oh, boy.  What, Sam?  Why you do this?  Because people like, you know, storylines on this show, and they wonder how things work  out.  And I guess because we kind of took a couple little cute jabs at him yesterday, that he  refused to talk for three hours yesterday on the Ron and Fez show.  So I want to apologize to Fez for whatever we did.  I thought they were unintentional jabs.  They were unintentional.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They certainly were unintentional jabs. 
[01:25:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  One was not unintentional.  They were both unintentional, Sam.  Okay.  Sam.  Yes, sir.  What were the two jabs, the unintentional jabs that Fez took so seriously?  I thought he was one of us.  Well, the first one.  We beat the shit out of each other every day.  What happened?  The first one, Travis came in and said, I have something for you.  And then Jim said, I hope it rhymes with Fezignation.  Right.  The joke was that he hopes that Travis is handing in his resignation. 
[01:26:00]  He just used the letter F instead of R.  That had nothing to do with Fez.  Nothing.  It just was something that rhymed blatantly with resignation.  Yes.  And it's that joke.  In fact, I would think it was spelled with an S, not a Z.  I don't know why everybody's even, why would you even explain that?  I know.  I would never even acknowledge that joke again.  Right.  The other jab was...  Which was way more innocent than Jimmy's, by the way.  Just for the record.  Oh, okay.  It was Jim's birthday, and Opie completely unsolicited, out of nowhere, nobody asked him 
[01:26:30]  about it.  I mean, I don't even think anybody was talking to him at the time, piped up.  Again, nobody was even mentioning Jim's birthday, and said, hey, is Fez going to be upset that  somebody's paying attention to somebody other than him?  Oh, boy.  See, that was a biggie.  Was that unintentional?  It was extremely unintentional, Sam.  Okay.  And Ronnie put it perfectly yesterday that Fez needs to apologize to me.  Oh, shit.  I don't see that happening.  Because of the superhero Batman thing. 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  We've never gotten past this, because Fez hasn't, you know, approached me and discussed this.  Because you...  He thought I was attacking him.  And you were just simply asking him what character he liked on Batman.  Yes.  Yeah, I don't know why...  That one doesn't seem like an attack.  And then he ended up crying, and he thought I intentionally was trying to make him cry all day.  And as far as...  I don't think he refused to talk yesterday.  I think he just locked up a little.  For three hours?  It happens.  If one of us locked up for three hours... 
[01:27:30]  Locked up?  It's a different...  The vibe of the two shows are different.  Well, I want to apologize for whatever I did this time.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Can I lock up for three hours?  I'm just going to put my head down.  Fuck yeah, man.  And take a nap.  Can I lock up for 15 minutes?  I'm just going to lock up.  Hold on.  I don't know why you're trivializing this.  All right.  Here we go.  Now you've got to ask me.  Somebody's got to talk.  Somebody has to talk.  You've got to ask me, like, you okay, buddy?  Are you locked up?  Oh, my God. 
[01:28:00]  What are we doing?  Okay.  I was just offering an apology.  We're getting back into a bad area.  You're all right, Ant?  What's wrong, Ant?  I don't know.  I just...  No, we can't do this.  You all right, buddy?  I'm just going to take a minute.  You okay?  Yeah, yeah.  I think...  I think...  Look, all I'm going for is a little apology for whatever I did. 
[01:28:30]  I want everyone to be happy.  Oh, you're apologizing?  For you?  No.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, I thought you were asking for an apology.  Oh, well, I am.  For the other thing.  See, I'm big enough to apologize.  You're apologizing for yesterday.  For whatever I did.  Well, I just said what you did.  Yeah, but it was innocent.  I guess, but I mean, it was a shot, I think.  It was complete innocence.  I'm not doing an impression.  Oh.  I'm not doing an impression.  So that's why I'm not doing any voices or anything that was said or anything like that. 
[01:29:00]  I'm just saying, you know, I would, it would be so nice during the show to be able to just go like, oh, I need like, I need three hours.  That Ronnie B.  Three hours.  I need like, give me a half hour.  That Ronnie B. is a saint.  I need a half hour and I'm just going to do this.  And you and Sam just talk.  What about me and Jimmy?  We like talking. 
[01:29:30]  Well, I think I'd be taking the Pepper Hicks role.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a little too much talent.  Are you annoyed?  Jimmy's got too much talent.  I'm working on it.  Is Jimmy annoyed?  Yeah.  It's not about this, though.  What happened?  Oh, gee.  Nothing major.  Nothing major.  Nothing.  It's the Jean-Luc Picard picture.  Is it?  No, I actually, now looking back, I'm like, yeah, I probably should have got that, but  I just, I didn't give a fuck.  But you'll be all right with that?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  What's bothering you?  It's cranky.  I'm tired.  I haven't slept much in the last three or four days or eaten much. 
[01:30:00]  I hear you.  Did you eat something yesterday?  You didn't eat anything the day before.  Did you have more birthday cake yesterday?  No, that was it.  I shit the birthday cake out the minute I walked in my door.  The minute I walked in.  It's weird how your body knows.  All right, so whatever.  So, oh, and I want to say hi to Jen from that old Jen and Alexa show.  She doesn't believe that I actually listened to her.  Was that really you texting?  I guess she's friends with Ronnie.  I am.  She comes on his show all night.  She does treadmill videos.  Have you seen her treadmill videos? 
[01:30:30]  No.  Do you want to see one?  Treadmill videos?  What does that even mean?  You do live from the compound.  She does live from the treadmill, I guess.  Oh, that's okay.  I don't know how to find her.  She's got a website, Jen.  Is she hot?  She's got a website, Jen.  Right?  I'm trying to remember her website right now, Jimmy.  Jen the Hut or something?  Or Jen?  Jen the Hut?  That's not a good sign.  Jen the Hut.  Jen, what's her website? 
[01:31:00]  Want to hear about a guy that likes to have sex with horses?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Well, while you find the site.  Or did you find the site?  I don't know what her last name is.  I think it's Hut or something.  Did you get that in your ear?  I just heard that from you, Rock.  He's talking to you now.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck you, Rock.  He just asked, what's a treadmill?  Oh!  Hey!  Hey, it's just a joke.  It's just a joke.  I answered the question.  I answered the question. 
[01:31:30]  What's 547?  I answered the question.  What?  What's 547?  Oh, the time you arrived today.  Oh, it was, right?  547.  You don't follow Sex Buzzer on Twitter?  What's wrong with you?  Is that getting later again?  What happened?  Yeah, it's kind of creep up.  It doesn't matter to me, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, this is her.  For God's sake, who cares?  No, that's...  What the hell?  What about the YouTube channel now, though?  No, go to her...  Yeah, here's her treadmill video.  Treadmill video, huh?  Yeah.  Good morning, everybody.  It's Monday, and I'm on the treadmill. 
[01:32:00]  And Ronnie's saying...  Hold on.  Because I will have a better day having done this.  Ronnie's saying she's sexing it up with the cleavage and stuff, and she's saying it's  an innocent cleavage.  Nah, nah.  There was a whole thing going on yesterday with this...  She's sexing it up a little bit.  And I do like her, by the way.  You're going to be very confused in a moment or two, but I do like her.  Really?  Here's her treadmill video, Ann.  Nice cam she's using.  I'm going to go with Dwight.  You just have to.  Oh, there we go.  And get on with my day.  So, oh, thanks for all your questions that you put in the chat box on justjenny.com. 
[01:32:30]  Very cool.  And regarding the question of whether the chat box is moderated, the answer is, I can go  in and delete the questions after.  Why is she doing...  Is she crazy?  Why is she doing it from a treadmill?  Is she crazy?  I don't think so.  Please be nice.  Why?  Because this is kind of a crazy thing.  Why is it a crazy thing?  She's not a treadmill.  So, question number one.  What kind of hair stuff do I use?  I like Dove Nutri-Oil products.  You can get them in the drugstore.  And they work really, really well. 
[01:33:00]  And I also like L'Oreal sulfate-free stuff and some BioLash.  Oh, by the way, here's my list of questions.  I write them down so I can remember what you want to know.  Who gives a shit?  All right.  So then, do I give my kids an allowance?  Not really.  It's like she's blogging from a treadmill.  And probably more than me.  Or is it vlogging?  But I don't really give them cash.  The cash is exactly extinct hands.  No, it's logging.  I pretty much do everything online.  So, I'll get stuff from Amazon or wherever.  She actually does a good radio show, whatever. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah?  She does radio?  Yeah, she's friends with Ronnie B.  She's on the Martha Stewart channel.  Oh, okay.  She used to do a show with Alexis, who's a real bitch.  Oh.  But Alexis decided to leave the show, I guess.  I think Alexis is Martha's daughter.  Oh, yeah?  She's gone.  And I mean that in a nice way.  She was a bitch on the show, which made it kind of fun to listen to.  Oh, that was her character.  I don't know.  I think, I, I don't know.  I don't think you could be that much of a bitch on the radio.  I'm not being a bitch in the real person myself, but.  Doesn't Warren Haynes' wife work here or something?  Yeah, she's on fucking Jam On, man. 
[01:34:00]  They're trying to get my picture signed for six months already.  How long is he going to take?  He's in New York.  What, the Warren Haynes picture?  Yeah, because Roland forgot to get it signed.  They said he gave it to the wife, and it's just never came back.  Yeah, she's, well, she probably smokes a lot of pot.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  She does smoke a lot of pot?  She does Jam On.  Jam On.  Do you listen to Jam On?  Jam On.  They play two songs an hour.  I listen to the Boneyard.  Two songs an hour, no commercials, and no talking.  It's an amazing channel.  Do you listen to Jam On?  No.  No.  They sometimes squeeze three in. 
[01:34:30]  No.  I swear to God.  Can you give me the playlist for Jam On, Sam?  Yep.  We're promoting SiriusXM right here.  Yeah, this is good crossover stuff.  It's amazing, right?  Yeah.  Can you tell me what they're going to play in the next hour on Jam On?  Jam On?  Jam Bands.  I don't think they're allowed to provide that information.  This just sounds like the best station ever.  But artists, you'll hear.  I like a good jam band.  You don't like jam bands?  Oh, fuck that jam band.  What do you like about music? 
[01:35:00]  Nothing.  You like Alice in Chains.  Oh, I thought you meant in general.  Nothing.  You don't like jam bands either?  No, I don't like jam bands.  You don't like piano shit?  You don't like jam bands?  You don't like when bands in general slow it down?  Right?  No.  You don't like any of the new rock bands?  I like powerful orchestral music.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Like what?  It's going to be like John Williams stuff.  Oh, like fucking movie shit?  Yeah, that's all cool, you know.  But do you buy their CDs?  No. 
[01:35:30]  So where do you listen to this stuff?  On the movies.  So you should listen to Cinemagic.  No, I actually...  Do we still have Cinemagic?  Yes.  What a waste of time that is.  For the compound promos, I've downloaded like a fuckload of music beds that are very powerful.  Okay.  Like movie trailer openers.  Yeah.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  You know, shit like that.  Sure.  And that's pretty cool stuff, but that's about as crazy as I get. 
[01:36:00]  Other than that, it's all about just, you know, lithium and fucking deep track.  Not even deep tracks.  Fucking, what's the other one?  It's not classic rock.  Oh, classic rewind.  Yeah, classic rewind.  Which is like new classic rock, if that makes sense.  I'll pop on some 80s unless they start playing some real fruity shit.  Classic rewind does like ZZ Top and stuff like that.  Yeah, yeah, stuff like that.  I like classic rewind, too.  That's cool.  By the way, I haven't given out the phone number in a while, 866-RON-ZERO-GEN, 866-RON-ZERO-GEN, 
[01:36:30]  if you're trying to get a hold of us.  866-RON-ZERO-GEN, 866-RON-ZERO-GEN.  That's not the right number.  What?  Oh, no.  Cinemagic.  Okay.  Now we're talking.  Now we're cross-promoting.  If this isn't the biggest waste of time.  That's a cross-promotion?  Yes.  Now playing is Captain America, the first Avenger by Alan Silvestri.  Oh, let's hear it.  Alan Silvestri is very well-known movie.  Can we just punch up Cinemagic at any moment?  Steven Spielberg is only giving a few interviews, and one of the people he's giving it to is Cinemagics. 
[01:37:00]  But that's how out of touch a guy like that is with radio.  Like, do you really think that they have the listeners that other shows in this place?  If you want to promote something in a movie, no one is listening to Cinemagic.  Movie people love Cinemagic, though.  It's like Peter Jackson was in here, and that's one of the only things he did.  How good for him?  They're dummies.  They're fucking dummies.  We work here, and I swear to you, I had no idea Peter Jackson did an interview with anyone.  No one knows. 
[01:37:30]  So he's talking to a channel that is just buried.  They're going to be at Comic-Con.  Who?  Cinemagic.  Doing what?  Interviews.  What are they going to do?  Just with everybody, I bet.  They'll get the big directors.  Oh, they'll get everyone.  Because the big directors are...  But no one will hear what the guy has to say.  They don't know that.  Oh, yeah.  It's Cinemagic.  Didn't Philip, Stephen, and Hoffman only do them?  Yes.  Because it has Cinna in it.  20 million subscribers.  Cinemagic.  Fucking idiots.  No.  That's perfect.  I would bet money there's less than 100 people that listen to Cinemagic on a weekly basis. 
[01:38:00]  I would bet money.  A week?  A week.  100 people.  What's on it right now?  I would bet money.  Captain America.  Can we listen to a little bit of it?  It should be a profit.  Is there a way we can listen to a little Cinemagic?  Who wants to listen to movie music?  And by the way, because I get into a lot of trouble lately.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  I still believe in the SiriusXM shit.  Yeah?  But the problem is there's a lot of dumb channels.  Like Cinemagic is a dumb channel.  It's time to start, like, calling, you think?  By the way.  Captain America for this is it, huh? 
[01:38:30]  Well, and before you hear this.  There'll be the trailer and stuff.  Eric's got to find it in the system.  It's got to be in there.  They're playing it.  Before you hear this.  You got it, E-Rock?  Not yet.  Yeah, he can't even find it.  I found the guy, but I can't find Captain America.  And I'm not even beating you up.  Of course you can't find it.  Play anything they play on Cinemagic.  Artists you'll hear include Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Chinatown, The Incredibles, Gone with the Wind, Kill Bill, Volume 1 and 2, Moulin Rouge, Back to the Future. 
[01:39:00]  And To Kill a Mockingbird.  What does this all have in common except for Star Wars?  It's the exact same song.  Yeah.  I found something from Cinemagic.  All right.  Let's hear a little sample.  A little Indiana Jones.  Who the fuck wants to listen to this in the car?  I would drive to this and I'd be like, whoa, I'm Indy.  Yeah.  Whoa, look out.  Why not?  Look, it's Nazis.  You're driving your car and now you're in a fantasy world.  This is great.  Or you turn it on and like, oh, I remember this song for the movie. 
[01:39:30]  And like 15 seconds later you go, all right.  And then, and then, now does it go to the, now bring it down.  Bring it down.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, wait.  Let me do a little.  Oh, boy.  I'm getting info on Cinemagic.  Oh, shit.  Rich in Ohio. 
[01:40:00]  What?  Yeah, recently they pulled it off the airways.  You can already even get it in your car.  You have to subscribe to it online.  You can go, you can only get it online?  Oh, yeah.  This channel is online.  You can subscribe to the online app and it's not a, you know, if you like that kind of stuff,  it sounds like shit.  Sirius XM.  Oh.  Make more room.  Yeah, they pulled it so they could make more room for, you know, Mel Kremson's favorites  like Brigham Young University Radio.  Oh.  So, wait, that's who Spielberg is talking to at Comic-Con from our platform. 
[01:40:30]  Cinemagic, which you can get online.  Can somebody tell dumb Spielberg to stop being so fucking famous that he's out of touch with  radio?  Holy shit.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Fucking dumb publicists.  Anthony, speaking of Comic-Con.  Yes.  I'm wondering, does Sam have standing orders to get you the DeLorean?  Oh, yeah.  There is an exclusive from Hot Wheels. 
[01:41:00]  It's a 1-16 scale DeLorean that comes in its plutonium carrying case.  Oh, wow.  That sounds pretty cool.  Do you want it?  No.  Unless you've seen myself, I don't want it.  I'll take a picture of it and show it to you.  That would just be good, right?  That's fine.  What's Cinemagic playing now?  Because it's been a while.  Let me refresh.  And it is Thor by Patrick Doyle.  Nice.  The theme from Thor.  Can we hear that?  Obviously, we're in a superhero rock block right now. 
[01:41:30]  It really is.  But you can only get it online, right?  Yes.  Sirius XM channel 806, which is online only.  Definitely.  This channel is online only.  And that is what Spielberg is doing.  But what annoys me is how fucking out of touch people are with who.  That annoys me so much that some publicist wouldn't say you're talking to 50 people on  the computer, you idiots.  They're also going to air the interviews on the Comic-Con channel. 
[01:42:00]  So, hey, if that's any.  All right.  More importantly, Pickle Farmer from Kansas.  The Pickle Farmer, by the way.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that song made me speed up three miles an hour.  Yeah.  And I don't understand.  I'm with Bill.  Why don't they just play entire movies on Cinemagic?  With the dialogue and everything?  Why not?  Finger of God.  You can figure this shit out.  Poignant moments where there are pauses.  They'll just be dead air.  You know they're there. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, but there's no ratings on satellite radio, so who cares if this doesn't matter?  Watch this.  Watch this.  Watch this.  It's pretty poignant.  Dead air.  They say there should never be dead air.  See how nice that was?  That was pretty poignant.  Everyone breathed.  They took it in a deep breath.  Oh, God.  It's a slow download.  Believable.  You can't find it, Iraq?  What's the matter?  I find these composers, but the music that they're playing doesn't seem to be either in 
[01:43:00]  profit or dilette.  So they're doing something different with the superheroes.  Oh, I know what they're doing.  What?  They actually have an orchestra here.  Oh.  And they're playing all this stuff live.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  It's an unbelievable concept.  Wow.  That's why it's not in the system.  Play another song, though, from Cinemagic.  I want to hear one more.  Well, I want...  You got the dust.  Oh, yeah.  Do they actually play this?  You got the power.  I don't think they play anything this funny. 
[01:43:30]  That's great.  This should be great.  Stop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The magic on the magic.  The magic.  That's ours.  We own the magic.  Let me say hi to John, New York City.  Johnny.  Love that song.  What's up, boys?  Fucking love you.  Winner.  Sorry.  We can't hear you.  Huh?  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead, John.  Channel 12.  Fucking, I went to go look for Cinemagic, and Z100 is on Sirius XM Radio now? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What happened was, in the early days of satellite radio, they were desperate, and they needed  a little help, so Clear Channel bought a piece of the company.  I believe it was XM and not Sirius.  I don't think Sirius had anything to do with this, and they're stuck in a long-term fucking  contract with Clear Channel.  And one of the stipulations is that something like a certain amount of programming has to  be Clear Channel programming.  I will guarantee that Mr. Big Shot upstairs, we're scared to say his name, really does 
[01:44:30]  not like that deal that was made a long time ago.  But he has no choice, because he's a contract guy.  He's a fag!  He's not.  Now you gotta go, sir.  Now you gotta go.  I don't think so, sir.  Now you gotta go.  But that's why you hear some Clear Channel stations.  Yeah.  Because a dumb deal XM made a long time ago that no one could get out of.  They've tried.  I remember talking to Logan about it years ago. 
[01:45:00]  So they try to get out of that fucking deal.  Because it doesn't make sense.  You can't have commercial radio stations on satellite radio.  Horrible.  Especially when we got our own branded hit stations.  Yeah, of course.  Yay.  But that's why.  That's why that's going down.  You want another song from Cinemagic?  Please.  One more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love this stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  D'Oil.  D'Oil. 
[01:45:30]  Play it through it.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a number one hit.  D'Oil.  D'Oil.  D'Oil.  D'Oil. 
[01:46:00]  You've got to play through it.  You've got to play through it.  D'Oil's right until he gets a fucking one more blade through his head.  Is Z100 really talking about revolving doors?  And then Boardroom Jimmy writes, riveting.  Are they syndicated now?  Elvis Duran.  They were syndicated.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  Elvis Duran is.  Yeah.  I cannot believe Apple is up $20 a share from yesterday.  I can't believe I didn't buy it. 
[01:46:30]  Why doesn't everyone just buy Apple before earnings?  Because what are we, dumb?  They crushed Wall Street expectations.  Oh, of course they did.  Post record profits.  Every fucking time they report earnings.  Why didn't I buy them at one minute?  And that's not going to stop anytime soon.  Everyone is buying the damn iPhone.  I'm even giving in.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Because I hate my droid.  People ask me all the time.  When the five comes out, it's going to be huge.  I'm going to be a five guy.  I've had the five beta on my phone.  Yeah.  And it's fucking fantastic.  I got. 
[01:47:00]  You do?  Yeah.  You get the new software?  Yeah.  What's different about it?  New software.  Well, when you're in the middle of doing something and you get a text, it just puts a little  thing up top that says that a text came in and you can slide it over and go right to  the text.  That's what I got.  You don't have to.  I got that in the Atrix.  Well, whatever.  It's not my phone.  I can't make a phone call with this.  It's my phone.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you disable that feature if you want to?  Yeah.  You can.  Go back to classic.  I like that feature, though.  So, yeah.  When can I have the new software?  Well, I am a developer. 
[01:47:30]  And then this is one of my faves, too.  It's like something's happening.  You're like, holy shit.  You hit the home button twice, go right to camera, and there.  You're right in your camera.  You don't have to go home.  Can't you set it to do that now?  No.  So, let me ask you.  When is it going to be?  Can't you have a camera on your desktop like that?  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, I got one.  So, what's the problem?  But I got to do this.  And I got to hit camera.  And now the camera opens, and now I'm ready.  But how about this?  I hit the home button twice. 
[01:48:00]  I hit camera.  Camera's right there.  I'm ready to take a picture within a moment's notice.  Look what I do.  Click once.  I'm taking your picture.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Shut your whole fucking phone off.  What are you talking about?  Make it go dark.  That's where I go.  Make it go dark.  Like what?  Shut the...  Like this.  Like that?  Dark phone.  All right, I'll do that for you.  Go ahead.  All right, I got nothing.  Right?  Ready, set, go.  Camera.  There.  I'm ready.  Camera.  Can't one.  See, I was...  No, I was right there.  Wait, wait. 
[01:48:30]  What?  Oh, did you have to turn yours on, though?  Your home screen?  What are you talking about?  All right, let's try it again.  Okay, hold on.  Why are we going black?  Let me go dark.  We're going black.  Oh, you said you're going black.  All right.  We're going dark.  All right, now what I do?  Okay.  Ready, and go.  All right.  Camera.  Bam, I just took a picture of you.  So did I.  Ant won.  I got yours.  No, I got you.  No, I got you first.  Who won?  Ant won that one.  You like it better, don't you?  It's not really...  I mean, I like you both exactly the same.  What if there's a UFO that's fucking flying off? 
[01:49:00]  Somebody will get it.  I was good.  You were good, but not as good as Ant in that area.  In that area.  Look at you.  You're still looking.  I'm not looking.  Let me see my picture.  Here's you.  You're still looking at your camera.  I took a fake picture.  I didn't actually take your picture.  Real picture.  What the fuck?  All right, let's do it.  You're wasting film?  All right, I'm dark.  All right, ready?  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, put the phone down.  Oh, shit.  Now we're going for...  This is not just...  It's like that samurai guy. 
[01:49:30]  Ready?  Draw.  Draw.  I got it.  I got it.  No.  See?  I got it.  You saw my flash.  Dude.  No, I didn't.  Where's your flash?  I'm pre-flash.  You can't pre-flash.  You got to flash to see who wins.  Look, you're still fumbling with the phone.  You're still looking at him.  He's still fumbling with the phone.  You guys got to do this with the flash on both of you, so we can go.  One more time.  Flash on.  Let me turn my flash on.  There's no way we're going to know the winner otherwise. 
[01:50:00]  This is crazy.  And then everybody won't be able to sleep tonight.  All right.  Okay.  Hold on.  We're going black.  Who says draw?  I'll do it.  All right.  Say three, two, one.  Three.  So there's no trickery.  Two.  One.  Draw.  I got it.  It didn't flash, though.  I win.  I got it.  Well, I didn't see a flash, Ant.  I win.  I know.  That was a stipulation.  You know what happened, though? 
[01:50:30]  No, no.  I got it.  That was a stipulation.  It was the flash stipulation.  Wait.  Why isn't my flash working?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's off.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Let me turn my flash off.  Because that round went to the Atrix.  I'm retiring.  No, no.  You can't.  No, no.  I'm retiring in the phone Olympics with a victory.  We need a rubber match.  Come on.  Come on.  I got the flash.  Let me check my flash.  This is very important.  Okay.  I see a flash.  All right.  My flash is on.  Oh, your phone takes forever to take a picture.  I'm so winning this.  You think?  All right.  Go black.  Go black.  No, no.  That was.  All right.  We're going to black again.  This is great. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  You guys ready?  Okay.  We want our hands.  Come on.  Huh?  I think his hands were way too close.  Hands on.  Hands on the arms of your chairs.  All right.  Three.  Two.  One.  Drop.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  And it stumbled.  Opie's flash went off.  Opie's flash went off.  What the hell just happened?  Oh.  Opie wins again.  My flash didn't go off again.  Mine didn't last night either when I was using it.  I don't know.  I think even when it's on, it's not done. 
[01:51:30]  I'm retiring with a victory.  You know what?  You might have had it on auto.  The iPhone fucking.  It wasn't a victory, though, because I got you again fumbling with your camera.  I'm retiring.  I got you again fumbling about with your camera.  My problem is two blocks from my house, I can't get a phone call.  That's the problem.  To check on my kid.  But at least your flash works.  At least the flash works very well.  But I don't understand.  Both phones, AT&T.  I still got my old BlackBerry.  Yeah.  Got the new Atrix.  Atrix, I can make a phone call two blocks away from my house on the BlackBerry can on 
[01:52:00]  the Atrix.  Really?  So someone explain that one to me.  What's different about the phones that I can't?  How about this feature, Jim?  I'm up here.  Watch.  I pull this down.  Yes.  And that's all my messages, texts, everything.  Okay.  Right there.  Right?  So Anthony, scroll down.  It was almost like pulling down a window shade.  Yes.  Yes.  Right from the top.  Um, five beta right here, motherfucker.  But here's the thing.  Aren't the Verizon, I want to get Verizon, I'm going to scrap it.  It's going to be the greatest divorce ever. 
[01:52:30]  But Verizon's only giving, uh, the iPhone one, the first one from years ago.  No.  What is the iPhone?  Are they going to have equal software when the five comes out?  Yay.  That would be really funny.  Yeah.  That would be funny.  That would be hilarious.  You just get the shittiest phone.  But you can't go online while you're on the phone on Verizon.  Why is that?  I don't know.  That's bad.  It's the network.  I don't like that at all.  Yeah, that's not smart.  I'm sticking with AT&T.  I'm an AT&T guy.  AT&T stinks.  AT&T sucks, but, uh, depending on where you are, every fucking thing sucks. 
[01:53:00]  No, I love my AT&T.  Dude, I travel a lot.  I'm in everywhere.  I'm telling you, AT&T is the worst service.  Really?  I've been everywhere, man.  I've been everywhere.  I go to Tulsa, Tuscaloosa, and a whole bunch of other places, Pittsburgh, Garnsburg.  Sex Bagel's insisting that he's on Verizon and he has the ability to make a call and  use the internet at the same time.  Oh, wow.  Hey, this sakes beautifully into the texting story out of Philly, so let's get that up.  Yes, it does.  And as you get that, I want to thank Fez for sitting in for the last hour.  I know you've got to go prepare for your show. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, stop now.  Fezzy, thanks for stopping in the last hour.  Now there's a problem.  Now there's a problem.  Looking forward to hearing you on the Ron and Fez show, so thanks, Fez.  Oh, that's the door.  Oh, the door.  Oh, my God.  That was the door.  There goes Fez.  Prepare for his show now.  He didn't say anything, though.  What?  I didn't hear Fez the whole time.  He just sat in for an hour.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:00]  Where's the texting story there, Seth?  It's here.  Are we going to just play this?  Sure.  It's in Philadelphia.  All right.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Someone said we should each take a picture of the clock to see exactly which time.  Oh, that is such a good idea.  No flash.  Can we take a picture of the clock?  That is such a good idea.  Can we take turns?  I'll go first.  No, you've got to do it together.  I've got to do it at the same exact time.  I know.  That's the joke.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:54:30]  Jesus.  You guys should be standing near the clock.  I do try to be funny in the show, believe it or not.  I can make sure we can really see it.  But that made sense, though.  If you both started at the top of a minute, that would have made sense.  You both could say, okay, go from the minute top and see how many seconds.  Oh, yeah.  That would actually work.  I just felt it was better if you did it.  I was just going for a funny.  Oh.  You can't suggest literal.  What?  You ready?  Take a picture of the clock.  I retired as the winner.  You've got to take a picture of the clock.  No, you weren't the winner.  My flash is fucked.  All right.  We've got to stand up.  Yeah.  I think you should be in similar positions. 
[01:55:00]  We've got to be really close to the clock.  You're on the right side of the clock.  I'm on the left side.  Okay.  Because I'm the lefty, right?  What the fuck up?  I hate politics.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Sam or Sam and Clark.  Okay.  All right.  I'm now in the game, too.  But I have to hit my code to open my phone.  Okay.  So Jim's going to have to hit his code to see if he can win.  He is.  Now, Jim is on iOS 4, Ant is on iOS 5, and Opie is on the Atrix.  Stop saying iOS.  You're going to what?  Throw it at the clock. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  Is everybody ready?  What are we doing?  How are we holding our hands?  Wait, wait.  No.  It's got to start down.  Jimmy's already cheating.  Oh, I didn't know.  Well, he's got to put his code in.  He's going to be way behind.  Can I have your finger on the on button?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Everybody ready?  Three, two, one.  Draw.  Everybody's got their phones up.  Oh, I fucked up.  I can see.  Okay.  Two fuck-ups.  Maybe you'll be even.  We're going to look at what time is on the clock.  I think I won.  You didn't win.  I think I won.  I fucked up. 
[01:56:00]  Anthony thinks.  I fucked up.  All right.  He fucked up.  Let me see.  What do you got?  And what is.  I'm ahead of you.  I'm before the 11th.  I'm right after the 11th.  I've got a picture.  I win.  Okay.  No, I'm before the 11th.  Right after 11 for Jim.  Look where I am.  Look where I am.  Official judge.  Closest to the 12th.  I'm before the 11th.  We were playing closest to the 12th.  No.  Opie came in third place.  First.  Anthony came in first.  Jim came in second.  There we go.  Try it one more time.  Jim has the best photographs. 
[01:56:30]  And I fucked up.  I took a clear photo.  Yeah, Jim.  The quality of Jim's photo is the best.  This is all about speed.  All right.  We're going to do this one more time.  We're going to take a picture of the clock again.  Cool.  This is good radio.  Live on the Opie and Anthony show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Ready?  If you're taking pictures of your clock, it's three.  Two.  One.  Draw!  Oh, shit. 
[01:57:00]  Somebody's flashing off.  Me.  I never had the camera.  I think you had it.  Oh, I know.  Oh, Jimmy.  What?  I think you got that one.  I know I got that one.  Let me see.  Did Jim get it?  Easily.  Let's see.  Oh, wow.  We are really close.  Neck and neck?  I beat him by a second.  I think you got...  Wow, look.  I'm right on the one.  I'm right after you by a split second.  Let's give it up for Jim.  I cheated both times.  I know.  I saw you.  I was going early.  I saw you.  I fucked up.  He literally, when I said two, his phone was already unlocked. 
[01:57:30]  Five.  I saw you cheating.  I panicked.  You did?  Did you panic?  Yeah, I did, man.  Well, part of playing this game is playing under pressure.  You realize that?  Yeah, it is a pressure game.  Squeezy panicked.  But my fucking...  My flash wouldn't work last night twice.  Yeah.  Do you ever have that on the iPhone?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what that is.  That could be a problem.  I don't know why the flash won't stay on.  When you put flash on, it should stay on.  Different lighting scenarios, maybe.  Well, no.  That's auto.  When you put it on auto, then...  I saw auto yesterday.  Auto.  Auto.  When the camera decides, hey, you need a flash or you don't. 
[01:58:00]  When you put it on, I don't care if there's a nuclear fucking blast going off.  I want that flash.  Let's get the texting story out of the way now.  This is happening in Philly.  And then we got a guy that's having sex with a horse.  Jailbroken phones.  Rules.  Shut up with your jailbreaking phone.  Unjailbreak it.  Update it.  Jailbreak again.  I know.  What is this?  All of a sudden, you got a guy?  Break out of prison?  I got a guy.  I don't want a guy.  I don't need a guy.  I got a guy.  Jailbreak.  You want some shit on your phone?  I got the guy. 
[01:58:30]  You could tether it for free if you jailbreak it.  Go.  Wow.  Everyone knows a guy that could do that stuff for you.  I got a guy.  I never know one guy that jailbroke his phone that didn't have some kind of fucking issue  when they plug it into their iTunes to do something.  I unjailbroke my phone.  Yeah, you did.  Yeah.  I wanted to update.  You went back to jail.  I broke in.  I went back to jail.  I broke in.  You broke into jail?  Like The Rock?  The movie?  That's right.  We shrunk higher.  Why break out when you can break?  Crazy.  I thought you meant The Rock.  The Wrestling.  Here we go.  I wish I did.  Of course. 
[01:59:00]  Don't talk about wrestling on this show.  I'm not allowed.  Philly texting.  Here we go.  When people don't pay attention, this video clearly shows just how dangerous things can  get in a hurry.  Cyclist Andrew Fleming was riding in the bike lane on 10th Street when he had to slam on  the brakes to avoid crashing into a man who wrongfully crossed against the light while  talking on his cell phone.  I've always had to look out for pedestrians, whether or not there have been bike lanes, but  I feel like it's a little more obvious now when you should be paying attention when you're  a pedestrian.  The city right now is in the process of trying out two new bike lanes on 10th and 13th Streets 
[01:59:30]  to go along with the existing lanes on Pine and Spruce Streets.  Our cameras caught cyclists running several red lights and others going the wrong way.  Good news.  Clear traffic violations that are now being enforced as part of an overall push to increase  safety awareness.  Alex Doty is the executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia.  We're starting to see a place for us that feels safe and feels like there's been room  made for us on the road.  And so it's time for us to start thinking about how it is that the rules of the road apply 
[02:00:00]  to us now.  Since May, 600 cyclists have been stopped by police according to the city.  590 received warnings.  Three received moving violations for running red lights and going the wrong way.  Seven were cited for code violations for cycling on the sidewalk.  During that same time, though, 87 motorists were ticketed as well.  I've tried to follow the rules of the road because I used to be someone who didn't follow  the rules of the road, and a couple times I got into accidents that made me think twice.  Oh, you're wild, man.  This set-up enforcement is being paid for through a grant that will last through the end of summer, 
[02:00:30]  and right now there are plans in the works to extend this grant another 40 weeks.  Reporting in Center City, Ty Quinonez, CBS 3.  That had nothing to do with the phone, though, really.  That had nothing to do with...  But everybody's using that story and then writing the headline because part of that safety  thing is that people who are texting and not paying attention...  And they just walk across the street and a bike almost right.  When you see a guy recklessly disregarding, like, walking, that's a weird...  This story doesn't bother me because that's like, you're going to fucking... 
[02:01:00]  With a car, you're going to die.  Yeah.  Or a motorcycle, you could kill the cyclist, too, though.  Sure.  So maybe they're just sick and tired of people...  Maybe within the age of cell phones and texting, people are just now walking in the middle of  the street and fucking putting everyone else in danger.  That doesn't bother me as much.  Yeah, but I don't trust the people that are giving out the tickets is the problem.  You know what I mean?  If they used it properly, I completely agree with you, Jimmy.  You just see someone on the phone, you're like, ah, my word against yours.  You give this job to one of these animals, and then they feel like they're high and mighty 
[02:01:30]  and have power.  Or now you're just, you know, checking your phone, and you're not even doing anything  or walking anywhere, and they're running up to you, giving you a fucking ticket.  I've seen it happen a million times.  That's the biggest problem.  You know, they don't use it properly.  Yeah.  Now, blow.  Huh?  I don't want to fucking see them write me ticket, being on the phone.  And if you're going to have bike lanes, I guess you got to kind of police them a little  bit, but...  But that bike guy in that piece was an asshole, too. 
[02:02:00]  He didn't have to jam on his brakes like that.  He knew, I ride a bike.  You know, way in advance that someone's not paying attention to him.  Yeah.  That guy waited until the last second and jammed on his brakes because he was that pissed off  of the guy that he wanted to, you know, make a scene and show that guy.  The guy on the phone didn't pull the squirrel move, did he?  What's the squirrel move?  You go around one way, and the squirrel decides, ah, I'm going to go back.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't do that.  Because that'll fuck you up.  Yeah.  I hate that.  Squirrels running across the street, and you're like, hey, you're safe.  He's past my car.  And God doesn't even know he's past the car. 
[02:02:30]  And on the last minute, he goes, ah, he runs back, and you just get, boom, boom, under  one wheel.  That's always sad when you hit an animal, huh?  No, I really don't care.  You don't care?  No.  I don't care.  It's its own dumb fault.  It's usually in the clear when I'm driving by.  Didn't you learn growing up, don't worry about birds, because it's almost impossible to  hit them?  Yeah.  You learned that, right?  Yeah.  One day, Kenny fucking blew up a bird, man.  I've never seen a bird come apart like that.  It's happened.  I've hit birds.  Those pigeons will explode. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All that powder on it, their little wings.  I wonder if Kenny remembers that.  And their feathers.  He doesn't remember anything.  It's like a goldfish.  You remember that one, Kenny?  That was pretty impressive.  He hit this thing.  We were only going about 30 miles an hour, Ant.  I swear to God, I don't even know if there was a piece left.  A big piece, anyway.  It was on that street by the store.  The thing.  Yeah.  The thing.  You remember how it came apart, though?  It was pretty amazing.  It was feathers.  That's how the pigeon laughs. 
[02:03:30]  I would, I'd feel bad hitting a dog or a cat.  Yeah, well, sure.  Like, you know, domestic animal.  But a squirrel gives a shit.  I'd cry if I hit a firefly or a flame.  Oh, oh.  Whenever I drive through the country, I just weep.  I drive very slowly, so if they fly into my headlight, they don't get hurt.  I do one mile an hour when I drive through the country, so I don't hit any bugs.  It's very inconvenient.  Yes, it is.  I never swerve from animals.  No.  It's a danger.  Yeah.  Why would you do it?  It causes accidents. 
[02:04:00]  Yep.  I had a dog once.  You did?  Just once.  Well, it wasn't my fault.  It wasn't on a leash.  It ran out in front of me.  Were the owners around?  Yeah.  The old lady was, like, crying.  And all I could imagine, it sounded like she was having an orgasm.  Oh, Jesus.  The way she was crying.  Oh, my God.  Kenny finds us hysterically funny.  You gotta find the silver lining in everything.  Was the dog okay?  No.  No.  Was it dead? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  D-O-A.  D-O-A.  Did you squash it?  Or just hit it?  I ran it over.  Did it go?  Did it make that?  I didn't hear.  My rock and roll music was probably blaring.  What kind of dog?  If I remember, it was like a German Shepherd type.  Oh, shit.  Those are big to hit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the type of dog you run over, you spill your coffee?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a big dog.  Was there a dog gosh on your heel? 
[02:05:00]  I don't believe so.  Good.  Good for you.  Probably just hit his little head.  Oh, yeah.  Smash this little skull.  Oh, yeah.  Laid on the side of the road.  I mean, I don't go out of my way to kill animals.  Don't get me wrong.  I hear you.  That wouldn't be nice.  I hear you.  I had a fucking pigeon in my work truck once, right on the corner, upper driver's side corner  of my windshield.  It looked like I hit a fucking full thing of baby powder. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  They just go poof.  Kenny, you know, was like, yeah, we hit a bird.  But, I mean, it's pretty impressive.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty amazing.  They do splode.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  It wasn't my fault.  Huh?  It wasn't my fault.  That bird was dumb.  I'm saying it once.  Birds are stupid.  Can't help it.  It was dumber than me.  You got bird brains.  Well, slow down.  Yeah.  If he was behind the wheel, he'd be the one on the road.  That dinosaur brain of yours.  Yes.  Size of a pea, right? 
[02:06:00]  Those dinosaurs.  Little walnut.  No.  Was it a walnut?  It would be a walnut.  Yeah, a little walnut.  Dopes.  Just enough to move.  I know Jimmy hates animals.  No thinking.  No nothing.  I love animals, but I hate their little brains.  Eat.  Like their little walnut brain.  Yeah.  You think he could distract a dinosaur pretty easily?  Look at Jimmy.  I guess they'd evolution, they were needed, but they're just machines.  There was no...  Yeah, and no thought process.  What would you do to distract a dinosaur if you were living? 
[02:06:30]  It wouldn't matter.  Whatever you did, it would be distracted.  Yeah.  Anything you did would distract him.  Maybe throw a rock.  Just do this.  And he forgot what he was doing.  Right, right, right.  Roll a rock.  I have no idea.  I don't know what I'm doing.  All right, we're going to talk about this horse next.  Horse?  Oh, yeah.  Another horse has to deal with some idiot having sex with it.  That horse didn't even notice.  That little fucking man dick isn't going to hurt a horse.  Nothing.  The horse just waves his tail.  Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh.  And says, my turn. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, when it's the horse's turn.  Oh, boy.  Vengeance is mine, saith the horse.  Yeah.  Plug out.  So, uh, and the media's looking for Casey Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Of course they are.  Speculation.  Media manhunt.  Los Angeles, California.  Who gets the first interview?  Uh, me.  Huh?  Who repays her a lot?  Well, who do you think would, you know, Nancy Grace isn't going to get that interview.  No, she'd be yelling at her.  Listen, tot mom.  It's like, look, I'm just Casey.  Shut up.  Tot mom. 
[02:07:30]  For anyone that gives us fucking pig money, she'll only make money if people pay her.  Nancy Grace?  Anyone who gives fucking this Casey Anthony money, because everybody knows she did something.  Yeah.  Uh, you should just fucking boycott or just don't participate in their fucking...  You know the world doesn't work that way.  No, I know it doesn't.  She got giant ratings on a news station that no one ever watched, and, uh, they see, uh, 
[02:08:00]  you know, the old dollar signs.  They got, uh, you know, they're thinking about their purse strings.  Yeah.  Purse strings.  What the hell?  Uh, uh, I want to go pee.  Okay, yeah, we could save this shit for after the break.  I'm going to make wee-wees.  And we were right again.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Rangers, you know, how there was that death?  Oh, right, right.  They raised their railings.  The baseball Rangers.  But that was an obvious one.  But you're going to see that in every ballpark next year.  Yeah.  There's not going to be a chance that a fan will go over the rails starting next year. 
[02:08:30]  All over.  Not a chance.  I'm a guy.  But that's, that's obvious, I guess.  You are.  All right, we'll have the horse story and some, uh, other things.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Na-na-na-na-na-na.  I guess we got to go home early today because, uh, Sam and Jimmy are going to San Diego for  Comic-Con.  Yeah.  What?  I guess we're going to wrap up the show now so these guys can get the hell out of here. 
[02:09:00]  We're still doing the after show and everything.  What?  We're doing this for you, Sam.  I don't...  We're leaving early for you, Sam.  Me and I want to be here until 10.  Of course we do.  But we figure it would be the right thing to let you, uh, get your head together for the  big trip out to San Diego.  But I just had to do the after show for longer.  Exactly.  I don't know what it would do for me.  What?  I don't know what it would do for me.  We're going home early so you could travel with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you fucking accept it?  This is not about us.  Because I'll leave.  It's a favor we're doing for you, by the way.  Right.  My flight's not until this afternoon.  And it seems like you're unappreciative about the whole damn thing. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, shit.  I'm just confused.  I mean, I don't...  I don't know what it would do.  Uh...  We're workhorses.  We would certainly make it to 958.  No problem.  Well, it's 10 when the show ends.  A little appreciation would be nice.  10.  So we're basically saying we're leaving now so you could get your shit together.  859?  Huh?  What shit do I have to get together?  I didn't...  Hey, we figured we'd give you an hour.  I did it last night.  You're not even packed.  I am, too.  No, you're not.  My bags are in the office.  Did your mommy go through and make sure you have everything?  No, I don't live with her anymore.  Well, did she come over and make sure you... 
[02:10:00]  You kind of live with her still.  I don't live with her.  If you're over there three times a week...  I'm not over there three...  Eating and getting your laundry done.  Eating your chicken nuggets.  Fucking sucking.  With your dumb chicken nuggets.  Once a week is the most I'm over there.  How many days a week is she at your house making sure your bed's made?  She doesn't come over very often at all.  Making sure you got groceries.  Doing the old sniff check on the sheets to see if there's any cum for premarital sex.  She doesn't check for premarital sex.  How many days a week is she over at your place scrubbing the toilet so Sammy has a nice 
[02:10:30]  clean toilet to shit into?  Jess is the one that scrubs the toilet.  Oh, wow.  Wow, what's wrong with you?  You let your chick scrub the toilets?  Of course.  Get mommy to do that.  Your mom would love...  Call her right now.  Okay.  She would love to scrub your toilet.  I think if you offer, your mom will be over at your house once a week just to scrub toilets.  She'd love to put a bag in there and collect the duty.  Oh, yeah.  That's disgusting.  Sort through it.  Make sure you're eating right.  Oh, look.  There's unchewed peas in here, young man. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Sam, don't eat peas.  Come on.  I don't eat peas.  I eat corn, though.  He does eat corn.  Yeah.  There's a lot of that in there.  Make sure you chew more.  You're not chewing enough now, Sam.  She doesn't...  She doesn't...  She's not there for dinner.  She doesn't do any of the household chores.  She's only been at the apartment once or twice.  How does Jay know we're hanging with Howard today?  The fuck...  What the fuck?  That is a bad sight.  How the fuck does he know?  What?  Are we getting your mom on the phone?  They're working on it right now, yeah.  She'll be pleased as punch to come on the air. 
[02:11:30]  MyOuterSpace.com.  Oh, what?  We were just talking about when William Shatner was promoting that last year.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know it was a MySpace take off MyOuterSpace.  It's just awful.  That's the one LeVar Burton was fighting hard to get some stage time for.  Yeah, it kept popping.  Wait, what is MyOuterSpace?  It's MySpace for geeks?  Yeah, it's like for sci-fi.  It's a social network for sci-fi fans.  If you're a LARPer, are you allowed to go on to MyOuterSpace?  It's not really a LARPing community.  Make a list, Sam, please. 
[02:12:00]  MyOuterSpace.  Who goes to MyOuterSpace?  Do MySpace people go to MyOuterSpace?  No.  You sure, Ian?  Positive.  Okay.  This is purely for geeks.  Is MySpace fighting back?  MyOuterSpace.  MyOuterSpace?  MyOuterSpace.  What are you doing?  Oh, shit.  Blame your mouse as you slam it down.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it's the mouse's fault.  You're a fucking third-grade educated zilch.  What's the matter, Sam?  You okay?  I'm fine.  See, this is why we've got to leave early.  We've worked you too hard. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  You need to just chill the fuck out for an hour.  Get your head together before the big airplane ride.  No, it would just help if you guys didn't assume that I think MyOuterSpace is not spelled with an O.  Are you all excited that you're going to go up in the air in a big airplane?  No, I've been in airplanes before.  Oh, you have?  Oh, okay.  I thought you were all excited.  No, I know Sam better have his fucking boarding pass printed out because I'm going to have  mine printed out so we don't have to stop and waste time with check-in. 
[02:13:00]  Mine was printed out last night.  Okay, good.  Oh, your mom did that too.  No, I printed out my boarding pass.  Does your mom have to do everything for you?  Jesus.  No, my mom had nothing to do with it.  You had a life.  In fact, my mom said, will you come over for dinner because you'll be on a meal for Sam.  But guess what?  I said, no, we're going to eat at home because that's what we're going to do.  And then through the tears, what did she say?  She didn't cry.  She said, okay, sweetie.  You think?  And then she hangs up and there's a picture of Jess and she just hits it with a fucking  knife from the cutlery drawer. 
[02:13:30]  She's very fun.  That's ridiculous.  All right, we're doing My Outer Space, but we've got Sam's mom on the phone as well.  She uses My Outer Space.  Oh, you know, we don't need my ass back.  You think Sam's going to be in the cockpit with the fucking pilot's hat on?  Sideways?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sideways.  Hey, look, you're flying the plane.  I'm 27 years old.  This is neato.  Thank you, mister.  I don't have a wings.  They'll give you the wings so you come out in the suit and they go, well, look, we got  a new pilot.  I think we got a new pilot, everyone. 
[02:14:00]  Young Sam will be limping.  What happened?  Nothing.  Pilot gave me a talking to.  He put his yoke in my hiney.  Hey, Bobby.  Terror threat.  Sam's mom, everyone.  Hey, how are you guys?  Well, Bobby, we were doing very well until we learned something today.  We're very, very disappointed in you.  And why is that?  We learned that you don't scrub Sam's toilets.  Sam makes Jess scrub the toilets.  And we're thinking you would love to go over there once a week and scrub the toilets for 
[02:14:30]  young Sam so you can spend more time with him.  We're also disappointed for a decision you didn't make 27 years ago.  Oh.  Yeah.  I bet it was an abortion.  No, I was going to say give him up for adoption.  Yeah, Jesus.  Abortion.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  That's just where my head went, I guess.  So what's the deal with scrubbing his toilet?  Would you come over and scrub the toilets if he wanted?  No, no.  I don't think I would scrub the toilets.  See?  Oh, boy.  That's really not in my job description.  Oh, we finally found your line. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  You do have a line.  Jim, you don't want...  And by the way, Sam would not ask me to do that.  Thank you very much.  Jim Norton said that he thought that not only would you scrub the toilets, but I wouldn't  flush and you'd keep my feces in a bag to save.  You're like, Jim is so weird, isn't he?  Well, I think you got that one.  But then Anthony said you would go through the duty to make sure Sam's eating properly.  He's eating right and chewing everything.  Anthony is beyond weird.  We all know that. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Bobby.  I don't know, Bobby.  I didn't have a mommy like Bobby.  A mommy and a daddy.  None of us had mommies like Bobby.  I missed that whole conversation.  Hey.  Carmen, why don't you make the pies for us?  Yeah, when are you bringing in more treats?  They were good.  Jim's pinching his helmets.  Why are you pinching your helmets?  We talked to Sam's mom.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  He thought that was just going to go unsaid.  Jimmy's so bad. 
[02:16:00]  Wow.  Bobby, Jimmy was...  What?  Where did all this scrubbing the toilet thing come from?  How come you didn't hear the segment?  No, I was in the shower.  He's doing it.  Mom, listen.  Don't mention you being in the shower again because every time you say that you were in  the shower, Jim Norton touches his penis.  No, no, no.  He's pinching his helmet, Sam.  He's adjusting.  What's wrong with you?  He did it again, though, when she said shower again. 
[02:16:30]  Nobody needs that much adjustment.  It's flattering, Jim.  What's that?  I find that very flattering.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, were you in the shower?  What's going on?  How long were you in the shower for?  I don't know.  God, I wasn't timing myself.  Thank you.  What are you doing?  That shower cam going.  That's disgusting.  Do you guys have the family soap?  No.  What?  Like one bar of soap.  One bar of soap where, you know, Bobby's scrubbing, you know, where she has to scrub. 
[02:17:00]  Come on.  That's that.  And then your daddy has to scrub where he has to scrub.  Oh, God.  Now.  And then your sister washes her face with the same soap.  We all use different bars of soap.  Do you really?  Yeah.  We have one bar in my house.  Yeah.  It's one bar, man.  It's the magical bar of soap.  Jay Moore taught us that years ago.  No, we use different.  Self-cleaning.  That's right.  Self-cleaning.  It doesn't matter what you do with the soap.  As soon as you put it back on that word, it goes there.  Soap dish.  Soap dish.  Thank you.  It's the last place you clean, and then the first place the next person cleans. 
[02:17:30]  I've never bought into that theory.  Oh, you always had your own soap?  Of course you did.  Yeah.  I had my own bar of soap.  I don't think I was spoiled.  Bobby bought everyone their own soap, didn't she?  I've never heard of that in a family.  If I asked for a separate bar of soap, my mother would have fucking smashed me.  Yeah.  Pounded you.  Yeah.  Then told me to turn the air conditioner off when we went to bed.  Well, we also.  A fucking cheapskate.  We also pointed to that air conditioning.  Was it hot?  Oh, it sucked.  My mother would fucking have a bat hearing.  Like, she would catch me.  I would be up.  This is when I was like 25 and living at home. 
[02:18:00]  It would be set in the morning, and I'd be up.  I'd get, like, hookers and stuff, and I'd be wanting to go to bed.  And your mom's?  And, yeah, I'd fucking turn the air on.  And I would lay in bed.  I'd go, I know she's going to wake up and hear this and turn it off.  And she wouldn't.  We fought so many times.  Over air conditioning?  Over air?  Yeah.  How much do you think it costs, mom?  Can you tell?  Why couldn't you tell her?  Look, it's hot and uncomfortable at night.  Because I wasn't paying rent at 25.  So I had to just do as I was told.  Why would she want to be hot and uncomfortable at night?  I don't know.  You should have told her, Mom, believe me, you don't want to smell this hooker. 
[02:18:30]  Believe you.  You don't want her sweating.  You want cool air in here, mother.  Bobby, would you allow Sam to bring hookers back to the house if he wasn't with Jess and  getting married and all that, obviously?  No, I really couldn't do the hooker thing.  No.  Could not do that.  Yeah, because Jimmy was allowed.  Were you allowed to bring hookers?  No.  Did they know you were bringing hookers into the house?  No.  No.  You would sneak them in the house?  Or I would just do it in the driveway, but they had no idea.  In the driveway of your mom's house?  Yeah.  And I would put the window black thing out. 
[02:19:00]  Weren't you putting a lot of people at risk by doing that?  No.  It was better than being in the street.  I knew we were safe there.  Yeah.  It was a turn-on.  But I told you, me and my friend Larry brought a pregnant hooker into my grandmother's basement  after she had died, like in the basement of my house.  And she sparked up a crack pipe.  She was like eight and a half months pregnant.  Oh, my God.  She sparked up a crack pipe.  Like, you can't do that.  She was standing by my grandmother's bookcase.  I knew she had a copy of Johnny.  We hardly knew you in there.  Oh, Bobby, I'm really sorry you have to hear this. 
[02:19:30]  And I do want to state...  Sam wouldn't do something.  No, never.  Never.  Never.  I want to state for the record, I wasn't spoiled.  We had liquid soap for a lot of my childhood, too.  So you wouldn't...  You know how expensive liquid soap was?  That's what you were told it was.  It's so uneconomical.  It goes through.  You go through it so quickly.  You think it was a weird dispenser?  You had to squeeze that little soft thing?  Make the liquid soap shoot out?  No, what?  That's...  I told you it was toothpaste, too.  Sorry. 
[02:20:00]  Moisturizer.  Bobby, why are you a super mom?  I apologize.  It annoys all of us in this studio that you're so, so good to Sam.  I'm not a super mom.  I'm just a regular mom.  You're a super mom.  You go out of your way to make sure your boy's taken care of.  Are you thinking about the bruised apples again, Opie?  Yeah.  Why did you have to bring it up?  Did your mom buy bruised apples?  You never bought bruised apples, right, Bobby?  Oh, never.  No, no.  My mom did because they were cheaper.  And then we, like Anthony said yesterday, we had to perform surgery on our fucking fruit.  The bruisectomy. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  And then there was a family I knew that used to go to Machinasian's Egg Farm and buy cracked eggs.  Like, the shells were cracked, so it was cheaper, but they were still just as good, but the shells were cracked, and they would be a lot cheaper.  We did the dent cans thing.  Dented cans?  Yeah, they would sell those a lot cheaper.  What are you bargaining like a Bangladesh marketplace?  You should have saw a cupboard, though.  You couldn't stack anything off.  Nothing would stack and they're all dented. 
[02:21:00]  And people think I make this shit up.  I'll get a brother on the phone right the fuck now to back me up.  We didn't have chewing gum.  My mother used to go down to the subway and scrape the black chewing gum off and then say,  chew this and be happy.  And she would scrape it off of shoes.  Same joke to us.  Bobby?  Bobby!  Bobby, are you starting to resent Jess more now that the wedding date is coming up closer?  Jess is great.  I don't resent her at all.  Well, what about all that shit-talking you were doing at the engagement party when you had a few belts in you? 
[02:21:30]  I wasn't doing any shit-talking.  Language!  In the backyard, me and you, you don't remember?  Of course you don't.  Bobby gets a little...  How many belts did you have in you, Mom?  Yeah, how many belts did you have?  Cut it out.  I didn't have any.  I love Jess.  She's terrific.  Knock it off.  You're just trying to make trouble.  I would never do that.  My mom, no, not at all.  Not at all?  You're not a teat-totaler or whatever the fuck the term is?  Language. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  All right.  Maybe a glass of wine.  Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, right?  In a social setting, not just with dinner.  Ah, very nice.  Social setting.  You ever pull a bottle of vodka out of the glove compartment while you're driving?  Jesus.  No.  That could be the worst thing you could do.  I know.  That is great.  A bottle of vodka.  Look around.  Take a sip.  Yeah, take a swig.  Snort.  Couldn't do that, especially not with Sam in the car.  No.  Not my boy Sam. 
[02:22:30]  He still has a baby seat.  The only 16-year-old in the car seat facing backwards.  How was it?  Oh, Bobby.  That's absolutely the wrong idea.  Sam is perfectly able to take care of himself.  I don't have to do any stuff.  Well, he's not able to clean his own toilet.  Well, I am able to.  It just happens to do it on Saturday mornings while I'm sleeping.  Well, when you tell her, I guess that's what happens.  Clean that toilet.  Clean it up!  Do you yell at her?  No.  The toilet's not clean.  And what... 
[02:23:00]  I think Jess has a good handle on things.  She does...  Yeah, the fucking toilet brush.  Bobby, I need to ask you about the premarital sex that's going on.  Ah, yeah.  That's fair.  Are you a religious woman?  Uh, no.  Oh.  But she was raised religious.  You were raised religious.  I was raised like, you know, like Pentecostal, evangelical, that whole thing.  My mother made sure we all went to church every Sunday morning, every Sunday night, every...  Oh! 
[02:23:30]  Wow, that's a long...  That's a lot of church.  That's a lot of church.  You know, I don't do that.  No, no, no.  I'm over that.  You might see me around Christmas and maybe around Easter, but that's about it.  That's it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Damn.  But no, she's not...  She didn't raise up for...  Are you a God-fearing woman?  I believe in God.  Do you believe God sees it as a sin that your son and his fiancée are having sexual relations  outside of...  And not only in the front?  No, I think God couldn't... 
[02:24:00]  What?  I said not only in the front.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Sam.  Sam.  Whether or not I'm even having premarital sex didn't even come out of my mouth.  Well, you didn't hear the front part, did you?  Oh, come on.  We didn't hear oral.  Come on.  Not just front sex.  No, I heard what you said.  I didn't say whether or not I was even having premarital sex, so front or the back certainly  didn't come up in conversation.  But you are.  But you are.  We all know.  Is that being saved for the honeymoon? 
[02:24:30]  Bobby, you would like to know, I'm sure.  That hasn't even been discussed.  Something should be saved for the honeymoon.  Something sacred.  As your mom, Bobby, is on the phone, answer the question.  Are you saving backdoor sex for your honeymoon?  Jess and I finally got to first base last night, and that's kind of where we're at.  Oh, wow.  That's hot.  Yeah.  Wow.  I believe Sam.  Yeah, of course you do.  Of course, you believe everything he says.  The thought of anything else drives you a little nuts, huh?  What was the worst thing?  A little Norman Bates mom kind of a thing going on there.  What was the worst thing Sam did growing up? 
[02:25:00]  That's a great question.  Because I'm sure he's hid a lot from you.  We all hide stuff from our parents, right?  What is the biggest thing Sam did growing up that was a disappointment?  Probably a B plus.  Yeah, it's going to be something.  Sam was not ever a disappointment.  Never.  My scholastics were in my strong suit, though.  My academics weren't always great.  No.  The worst thing he did is maybe one of the girlfriends he had was really awful.  She hated one of my girlfriends.  Chandra Levy. 
[02:25:30]  Black.  He turned up missing.  Sam killed her in the park.  Wait, hold on.  Sorry.  Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.  She was really scary.  What?  What's that?  She was scary.  Oh, she was too black.  We all know Sam likes black girls, but he went too dark for mommy's taste, I bet.  Would you throw N-bombs around the house, Bobby?  No.  Don't bring that black girl.  Just because it's Tuesday, why don't you bring her around this house again?  Bobby sounded like Dog the Bounty Hunter on the phone. 
[02:26:00]  We used the word in this house.  Your dad's mustache straightened out when he saw her.  Like a cartoon.  Why was this particular girl scary, Bobby?  She was very, well, first off, she was really a gorgeous girl, very tall.  She looked like a model, but she kind of, I could tell she was just using Sam.  Oh, for what?  For what?  His gray hair?  Yeah, what's he?  No, she wanted, I felt like she wanted to get away from her life and her family, and 
[02:26:30]  she saw Sam as a way out.  And she was sort of saying things like, oh, Sam, you know, I really need a new computer.  Could you get me one?  You know, Sam ran right to the store, right?  Actually, the request for a new computer was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's  back for that one.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, she didn't last much longer after that.  No?  No.  Why would she say that in front of your mom?  Well, she didn't. 
[02:27:00]  I, when I told my mom that I broke up.  You told on her?  You told on her to your mommy?  I told her I broke up with this girl.  Yeah.  And then she said, oh, why?  And then I told all the stories about, she asked for a computer.  And then she sat there and went, good.  You know, Sam, there are plenty of fish in the sea.  I wasn't, I broke up with, I wasn't.  Did you get that fish in the sea speech?  No, I wasn't broken up about it.  I was fine with it.  Sure.  I broke up with her.  It's still like you're still hurting.  Is he still hurting over this one, do you think?  Yeah.  What, Bobby?  I'm sorry.  You hear what you said.  I'm sorry. 
[02:27:30]  No, he would bring, he would bring her over and I would be nice.  And then as they were leaving, I'd be shaking my head and saying to Sam's dad, Sam has  got to get out of that.  Why doesn't he?  Oh, boy.  Talking behind Sam's back.  Yeah, I love it.  That is girls.  But you wouldn't say anything bad because you didn't want to, you know, shake things up  in his relationship.  Yeah.  I have a question, Sam.  When you were having sex with this model on the family couch, was your dad peeking around  the corner to take a look? 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  I know.  There are so many.  To get a little peek-a-roo.  Oh, no.  There are several inaccuracies of that story, so I'll say false.  Did you see his head turning around?  You didn't notice something, you didn't like see like a shadow on the wall of what could  be a hand going back and forth?  Oh, no.  Oh.  Made some more liquid soap.  And also, she wasn't worth a computer?  That's how bad this girl was?  Listen, I hate to, believe it or not.  I couldn't afford a computer now, so if you thought I could afford a computer then. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, boy.  I mean, maybe mom and dad could have helped.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to.  I mean, my mom is still talking shit about this chick.  I've been dating Jess for six years and she's still talking.  If I'd gotten to my mom, hey, can I borrow some cash and buy her a computer?  It was all about the melanin.  Your mom is just finding reasons.  The bottom line was she didn't want that black woman in the family.  Was she black?  Oh, yes.  How black, though?  Wow.  Fairly black.  Fairly black.  You know, on a scale of what to what? 
[02:29:00]  Well, are you talking, I mean, she had a lot of sass.  My phone's off.  That black?  No, not like, she wasn't Manute Bull.  But she was talking then Beyonce?  Yeah.  Now, let me ask you, was that a rebellion against mom?  No.  You trying to show that you're independent?  No, it wasn't a rebellion.  I didn't know my mom would have a problem with her.  Did she have a nice pussy?  Oh, God.  How dare you?  Oh, God.  Bobby's on the phone.  Stop it.  How dare you?  Oh, Bobby, I'm sorry.  I thought we hung up on you.  Yeah.  So she wanted a computer. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're outraged by what I'm saying.  But Jimmy just stood up to show his raging heart on.  Well, how does Jimmy get?  Jim's partially erect right now.  It's not true at all.  Bobby, Jim is, yeah, he's definitely erect.  That's not true.  I would give him a five or a six.  That's not true.  I want to know, how on earth would you guys let Sam go to this Comic-Con thing with Jim?  Oh, man.  I'm a very positive influence on the road.  I don't drink.  I don't do drugs.  That's right. 
[02:30:00]  I'm not shy about working.  I like to work.  Don't drink.  Don't smoke.  So I'm actually a good guy to travel with.  I'm a very responsible traveler.  It's true.  He doesn't drink or smoke, and he's a workaholic.  But he does get, you know, prostitutes every so often.  But it's always at night after Comic-Con is done and Samuel's in bed.  Bobby, can you make a room?  Jim tucks me in and he goes get a hooker.  Jimmy is basically going to be Sam's chaperone.  So you want to lay down the law, Bobby?  I mean, he's definitely going to get Sam hookers.  But I think the best you can hope for is that he doesn't bring hookers with, you know, the extra piece. 
[02:30:30]  Now you're worrying, Jess.  Oh, God.  You know, please, I don't even like to think about it.  But luckily, I trust Sam, and I don't think he will do any of that off-the-wall stuff.  Off-the-wall.  Yeah.  What's that?  Sam, you'll be good, right?  Yes, mother.  Very good.  See?  Mother.  My mom has never asked me that question.  Mother blood.  Yeah, Sam is a fine travel companion. 
[02:31:00]  But I'm a safe guy to travel with.  Yeah.  Yes, I'm very responsible.  But you have a raging heart on right now.  Why do you have a raging heart on?  Why don't you, is the question.  Why question me?  Jim and I went last year, and good work got done, and we had a good time, and everybody  came back safe and safe.  We ate fine restaurants.  Yep.  Jim even signed the wall of one of the restaurants.  We can go back this year to see if they added your picture.  That would be nice.  Wow.  That's exciting.  Sam orders like a kid.  We all know that.  So why would you go to the fine restaurants? 
[02:31:30]  Oh, 23rd Bond fell.  He was fine.  I mean, it was like...  Well, then, Jimmy, how come you don't let Sam sign the wall?  Well, it's not up to Jim.  It's not to me.  It was they just asked me to sign it because they recognized me from stage and screen.  What?  They don't recognize Sam?  They did not.  My mother thinks I'm more of a celebrity than I actually am.  I don't know how to break this to you, but Sam is lucky that the security guy at the  door recognizes him.  Nobody knows Sam. 
[02:32:00]  My mom regularly tells me I should be sending some of my stuff to Tina Fey.  Yes, I do.  I think he should.  Don't you guys?  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.  No!  Why Tina Fey?  Like, write Tina Fey and then the address to Rockefeller Center.  Send what?  Your radio?  One time on Tina Fey's show or something, she used, what's the hat?  And I said, that's your line.  You should be sending all of that to her.  I did create it. 
[02:32:30]  I invented it.  Or else suing her for some kind of history.  Sam can't do no wrong in her eyes.  Oh, I know.  Sam is a little angel.  It's a bee's knee.  Jimmy, you want to know more about the shower before we tell Bobby to go?  No, I don't want to be disrespectful.  Bobby, can you tell us a little bit about your shower routine?  That's all.  Can you tell us anything about the shower?  I would just think hair first.  What?  Well, she has curly hair, so you've got time on the hair.  You've always got to wash the hair first.  Do you wash your hair first?  Don't answer the question. 
[02:33:00]  I am not telling you guys.  I'm talking about on top of her head.  Yeah.  Do you wash your hair?  You come up with strange things.  Yeah, we kind of do.  But believe me, there's a goal at the end.  Bobby, we're just trying to get to 10 o'clock.  Help us out, will you?  Yeah.  I just...  Oh, Jimmy's got a question.  I see it in his eyes.  No, I don't.  You can ask it if you want, Jim.  No, no, no.  Bobby, just a little bit about your shower routine.  Nothing crazy.  We don't want to know your...  No, no, no.  Nothing dirty or anything, but do you wash from head to toe?  Start with shampoo. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Even if it wasn't sitting there, I wouldn't be talking to you guys about this.  But it is a head to toe thing.  It's your standard shower.  I would imagine you turn on the shower, water.  Holy shit, that's Philly.  Water.  That's the first time that's ever happened.  Water.  Water.  Water.  That's how you say it.  You turn on the shower so it gets the proper temperature.  While the shower's getting ready, you give yourself your breast exam.  Oh, what?  Well, she's got to make sure, Sam.  Well, I understand that, but it's not something that you talk about.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:00]  I mean...  I'm just picturing her routine, Sam.  Why don't you just...  See, I was picturing this.  Oh, okay.  The water's on.  The water's warm.  And then, like, getting the hair wet.  The rope falls?  Yeah, the rope falls.  Are we past the rope falling?  It doesn't fall.  She walks into the shower, shuts the door, and then there's that shut the eyes, put the  head back, and let the hair get wet.  Oh, God.  All right.  But our hands go down her hair and then over her shoulders and across the front a little.  What are you doing just to get wet?  I picture that the shower head comes off and is aimed upwards, and there is such a reaction 
[02:34:30]  that the soap dish gets pulled off the wall.  Oh, yes, Bobby.  Sorry, Bobby.  Sorry.  Come on.  Sorry, Bobby.  See, you know what's screwy here, Bobby?  If you just would have said, yeah, I shampoo my hair, none of this...  We wouldn't have to speculate.  Listen, Mom.  See, this is what you do, Bobby, that's wrong. 
[02:35:00]  If you would have just gave us some of your routines in the shower, we would have moved  on.  Without any sexual innuendo or anything.  Jim would have touched his penis if you had done that.  What you should do right now is say, guys, I was just kidding about the shower.  I made a mistake.  I never...  Oh, no, she has to shower.  I never bathe, and what I was doing before I spoke to you was I was eating plain toast.  Ah.  Ah.  And that's it.  Ben could do something with plain toast.  What kind of products do you have in the shower?  What difference does it make with what products she has in the shower? 
[02:35:30]  You know what we learned from Jen, that Jen girl on the treadmill, that she likes the  Dove products.  See, I remembered.  Right.  Jimmy, would you come in and loo for my stretch mark?  That's from Caddyshack.  That's from a movie.  Very funny movie.  All those weird sponges that look like coral or something.  It doesn't make a difference.  Yeah.  I'm trying to not give you guys any material at all.  Just a standard washcloth.  A Martha Stewart washcloth.  A washcloth.  You could tell them the brand of the washcloth. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, could you tell us exactly, like, what kind of shampoo is Bobby using the shower?  Yeah, I want to know what it looks like.  What difference does it make?  Maybe we can turn on...  What difference does it make?  Good question.  I'll tell you why.  Okay.  Because I think her hair looks really good, Sam.  You son of a bitch.  She's got curly hair and the shampoo.  Oh, man.  She's doing something right.  Doing something right.  So you could teach the people out there.  Maybe they're turned on to a new product.  You're working an angle, you son of a bitch.  Why would you be giving free advertising to somebody then?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My sales department is going to get all pissed off if you go any further with this.  I will guarantee that Bobby does not use PERT. 
[02:36:30]  How thorough on the undercarriage.  What the hell?  I mean, is it a thorough wash?  You didn't even build up to that question.  Because it just popped in my head.  It's like...  We want to know wash first or shave or shave first.  Oh, my God, Bobby.  In general.  Bobby.  Don't acknowledge the questions.  Somebody's got to get some controls there, okay?  Yeah, this thing has gone way off the rails.  It really has.  I want to apologize first.  Do you have any problem areas?  Oh, it doesn't matter.  You've got to spend a little more time.  You know, bring up...  Let's talk about... 
[02:37:00]  I'll be honest.  I've got a food pocket, so I have to make sure I floss good in that area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my ball bag.  Oh, jeez.  See, there's no need for that.  No need for that.  We were doing better when we were talking about this.  I wouldn't use disrespectful language to Sam's mother.  No, no, no.  Thank you.  No, I'm sorry, Sam's mother.  No.  I'm just thinking the washcloth.  Who I know real well and it's going to be awkward next time I see her.  Yeah, this is what you do in relationships.  The washcloth is better than one of those cleaning puffs that girls use or something.  You think so?  Just a straight washcloth because you can really get in that crack in the back. 
[02:37:30]  You're talking about the undercarriage again.  No, I'm just talking about like your ass.  You've got to wash.  No, anybody knows they've got to wash the ass.  Let's be honest here.  We all do it.  Of course you have to wash it, but it's not something you should speak to my mother about.  Well, she's a human.  Just treating her like a real person here.  I like to think that Bobby is all soaked up in the shower.  Just soaked up in the shower.  Why do you like to think that?  Very soapy.  Soapy.  You have a wife at home who's listening thinking this has gone horribly wrong.  She's helping me out. 
[02:38:00]  Do you look at yourself in the shower and go like, I'm doing pretty good.  Doing pretty good for a woman.  Sam's right.  This has gone horribly wrong.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Well, are you going to make us treats to make it all good?  To make it up to us?  This has turned south.  I think she...  Yeah.  I'm going to send you guys some treats real soon.  Bobby.  I strike nine in them.  I honestly think you owe us a pie and some cookies because we're not getting what we need to get out of you today.  So in the end, there's a waste of time. 
[02:38:30]  So I'm thinking that maybe you owe us a...  That's not a waste of time.  Owe us a pie or two to make up for it.  That's not a waste of time to say to somebody on the phone.  Fair is fair, right, Ann?  Save it, watch it, watch it.  I'll send you a pie, but you're never going to get this out of me, you guys.  So I don't need to...  Oh, that awful thing to ask someone's mommy.  My mother is a woman of conviction.  She's not going to buckle to your question.  Yeah, yeah.  She's not.  She's very strong-willed.  I just sit here and put up with all of this stuff because you guys give Sam air time. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's hoping someday this will translate to something financial.  Yeah, something will happen out of this.  Believe me.  And Tina Fey will tune in and be like, man.  That woman's son was great.  If you're a favorite, that would be good.  And Tina Fey will be like, your mom, Sam, is fantastic.  Hey, I've got to talk to this Sam character.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that the way it works?  You get nervous when Sam goes away on vacations and show-related.  Only when he's with Jim, did you just say? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  No, I'm a good guy to go on the road with.  You have a bad reputation, Jimmy.  I know, but I'm very responsible on the road.  Sam's in very good hands with me.  They had a good time last year.  Yeah.  They seem to really enjoy each other.  And for the record, I should state again, I'm 27 years old, so it's not in your mom's eyes.  Not in your mom's eyes.  You'll always be 12.  Okay.  Does she come over and-  How old is Sam in your eyes, Bobby?  Sam is 27.  You guys are perfectly capable.  He and Jess are wonderful. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, he's an adult.  I picture Sam in the tub at the house, and you're using Johnson's baby shampoo on his hair  so his eyes don't burn.  You guys enjoy thinking that way.  That's fine.  I don't know why we do, but we do.  My mother in no way bathes me at this point in my life.  No?  No.  When did that stop?  Like two years ago?  No.  Many years ago.  Like 25 years ago.  Wow.  I thought she was a little more caring. 
[02:40:30]  Well, I became capable of bathing myself.  Does she have like a shower brush?  Like, I just want to know.  I don't know what she does in the shower.  But it's certainly none of your business.  Do you have a callus stone?  Yeah, do you scrape your calluses over the toilet?  I'm not talking about my shower, you guys.  What is up with this?  Although my mom is a big fan of foot care.  What's up with this?  Let me look at Jimmy's pants.  Oh, he's tenting.  What's up with this whole thing?  Jesus.  It's crazy.  Where's the mister today? 
[02:41:00]  I like those.  Is the mister listening in another room now?  I'm sure.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  He's going to come in here with a shotgun.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Sorry about that.  I thought he was out of the house for this conversation.  And you're a little questioning about his mustache going straight.  Well, that's not going to sit down.  That's just funny.  And Jim implying that he masturbated to whatever he was masturbating to will not go over well.  He just said a shadow.  You'd see a shadow moving back and forth as you were having premarital sex on the couch. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  Like the lamp would be pushing and Sam would be panicking, hoping the girl didn't see.  And also the glint of the watch going back at 300 miles an hour.  300 miles an hour.  And then would you hear like a, oh, Sam would always put on slow jams so you wouldn't hear  the heavy panting.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:00]  Bobby, I apologize.  This is horrible.  Oh, Bobby, this has just gone.  Really, seriously.  This has just gone so bad, Bobby.  I think now you've got to add like a cobbler to, you know, the offerings.  Well, this isn't her fault that it's gone bad.  I think it's very much her fault.  I'm going to send you a tea lime pie if you'll get off the shower routine.  Ah, see, get off that shower routine.  Yeah.  Enough of your little shower bit.  Yeah.  When do you, you know, in the morning?  Yeah, what is, you know, what are you asking her? 
[02:42:30]  The shower.  No, she said off the shower.  So there's other things you do in the bathroom.  So when do you drink coffee?  I don't know.  Are you talking about?  What's the best soap to use?  Bobby, what's the best soap to use to get mustache wax off your thighs?  Oh, my.  Okay.  I mean, you know what that question is.  Way, way, way too far.  I'm just thinking if it's spilled in her lap.  Neither of them are going to be happy.  Or if she sat in it.  Oh.  Ignore that one.  Bobby.  Totally ignore it.  All right, I will. 
[02:43:00]  Bobby.  Bobby.  Oh, my God.  This has gotten ridiculous.  Oh, Bobby.  I got to apologize for that.  I don't know where it comes from.  I get overcome with the show and I say things I would never say outside of the studio.  You'd think you guys would.  I don't know where it comes from either.  Let it be known Sam could have hung up at any moment but decided that he needed to keep you on the line for this torture.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't have access.  I blame Sam in the end.  I don't have access to the phones.  It's all Sam's fault.  Although I would think that you guys would treat her a little bit more respectfully based on everything that she has done on this show in the past. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.  Could you imagine what we'd be asking her if we didn't like her?  How old a gal were you when you had young Samuel?  How old was I?  Yeah.  Well, that's easy math to figure out her age.  I wasn't trying that.  I just wanted to know.  Maybe she doesn't want to say that.  A woman never reveals.  That's rude.  I just wanted to know how old she was when she had to take care of young Sam.  Was it early 20s, let's say? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  A little older.  A little later in life?  Later on.  Yeah, okay.  A little later on, yeah.  So, like, early 30s?  Okay.  All right, somewhere around there.  Sam's parents look really good for their ages.  She got her party out before I was born.  Oh, she did.  I'm not telling you how old I am.  No, I could get a good ballpark there from that, though.  Yeah, that's good enough.  That's good enough.  A ballpark is okay.  I'm thinking it was late 20s, early 30s.  You had young Samuel.  Okay.  Let it be what it is.  Let it be.  She doesn't want to. 
[02:44:30]  Late term baby.  Did you have to do all those chromosome tests?  She was 57 when she had me.  Make sure it wasn't going to come out, like, a little bent up.  Like you did?  Yeah, like you did anyway.  I'm fine.  I came out just fine.  Well, no, apparently you didn't.  Bring home some dates.  I want computers and melanin.  She was a good-looking woman.  What are you going to beg for us to make up for all this?  I have to make up for something?  Yeah, you didn't answer.  You didn't tell us the shower thing.  90% of our questions went unanswered. 
[02:45:00]  We had to work a lot harder than you did,  because you didn't answer the questions that everyone wanted the answers to,  so we had to work hard with our comedic skills.  Right.  And our prodding skills.  And our just plain filth.  Right.  I don't have much time of air time on your show.  Like, what are you going to do for me?  Shower curtain or glass door?  Oh, God.  Again with the shower.  Just wondering.  Yeah, that's a good question.  Forget about you being in there.  Just this is a home building question.  Shower curtain or glass door?  Nothing good can come of answering this question.  Just wondering.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  What is it?  Neither one.  It's a walk-in shower.  Oh, why would you answer the question?  Why would you answer that?  Wait, so there's no door on it?  That's really hot.  Oh, my God.  So all of a sudden, like, the steam will clear and you'll just be there?  That's a good one.  Wow, I didn't expect no door at all.  Well, of course not.  That's why I informed her not to answer.  Only a couple that's a goer.  She's an old hippie, man.  Yeah.  That's some hippie shit.  She and my father have separate showers. 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  For the record.  In what?  Separate bathrooms?  Yes.  That's a secret to a long marriage, Sam.  Bobby, you know that, right?  The fuck is that?  We learned that years ago,  because then you don't see what he's doing with his mustache  and he doesn't see what you're doing with your...  That's true.  Don't worry about what she's doing with what.  I don't know.  I didn't even know where that is.  Work up, work up.  But there's no shower door?  No.  You can just watch it.  The secret is separate bathrooms and separate checkbooks.  Ah.  Secret to a successful marriage. 
[02:46:30]  Separate friends.  Are you breaking those glass ceilings?  Yeah.  So you don't have any of his garbage in your shower  and he doesn't have any of your feminine stuff in there, right?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  Why is Kevin from Connecticut turning on us?  My bad.  I didn't describe my showering routine.  I'll bake you each a pie.  Yeah.  That's exactly what we're asking for today.  We do a radio show.  We have to entertain people.  And if Bobby's not giving us what we want,  then she has to make it up to us.  To take the counterpoint,  before you got my mom on the phone, 
[02:47:00]  you said you were going to leave early  because you were going to give me a break.  I'm so glad we didn't.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We wouldn't have heard about Bobby's showerless,  shower doorless shower.  That's great.  It's fantastic.  You could just sit there and take a dump and watch the steam.  Why would anybody do that?  I just picture walking out of the steam.  Like you can't see, right?  In slow motion?  It's just steam, yeah.  And then like the steam goes.  Can you give us the cars moving in stereo, please?  As a leg, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Slow motion, right?  Hold on.  Let me get the music for you, Ant.  I mean, you're picturing something that I certainly could visualize myself.  Here's what it is.  Yeah.  I don't want to be pictured like this.  No, no, no.  It's not you, Bobby.  It's some other Bobby.  Yeah, we're going to make,  this is a make-believe Bobby.  With a doorless shower.  Yeah.  That owns a brainless son.  We got the music?  Yeah.  He's getting it.  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  But this doorless shower opens up,  just conjures up such images. 
[02:48:00]  No, it shouldn't.  All right, here we go.  The steam.  It's just a shower.  Because the shower is real hot by the end of the shower, right?  So the steam, you can't even see inside where this door should be,  but for some reason, hey, she don't need no door.  And then very slowly,  you see some red toenail polish as that foot just comes out and steps on the shower mat in front.  And then there's vortices that turn and spin the steam around as it slowly clears from the door. 
[02:48:30]  Two of her hands with blood red fingernail polish grab where the door should be,  the edge of the door jamb of the shower,  as she then pulls herself out as the clouds of steam now are just about totally disappeared.  And you know what part comes out first?  No.  Of course I don't.  Nipples.  The hairiest part.  Oh, what?  No.  She doesn't have hairy nipples.  No, no.  Those come out first. 
[02:49:00]  And then in slow motion,  she shakes her hair and water goes flying around the bathroom as she grabs the towel  and then pats her cheeks with it.  And I mean on her face.  Pats her cheeks on it and then dabs her breasts and then slowly looks down at them  and touches them going,  I am a beautiful woman.  And then she looks up at the webcam and winks. 
[02:49:30]  We forgot following close behind it.  Following close behind?  Yeah.  Little Jimmy Nord.  Oh, no.  Jimmy has never showered with her.  Oh, my God, no.  I get out of the shower, but it's unsexy.  She's all hot.  And I'm just standing there.  You got a towel?  I'm dripping here.  My fat stomach.  No, that'd be great.  My mother has no interest in showering with Jim.  Sam, I think Eric from Virginia Tech says it all when he writes,  who isn't pinching their mule right now?  Nobody should be.  It's my mother.  And then she takes her hand on the mirror.  No, this is imaginary Bobby. 
[02:50:00]  What's wrong with you, you sick fuck?  Because it's so steamy in there.  Anthony said this is a fake Bobby.  Yeah, a fake Bobby.  Different Bobby.  With a son, you know, named Sam.  Bobby Kelly.  And then she takes her hand on the mirror because it's all steamy and gives it that  so she could see.  And then she slowly turns around and puts her head over her shoulder so she could see her ass.  Why would she look at her ass?  Just to see how she's doing.  Like, you know, she's a woman.  And she's nude because of the shower. 
[02:50:30]  And she's just looking at her.  She puts one hand on her hip and then kind of looks and gives a little smile like, yeah,  I still got it.  Then she hits her thighs like Sylvia Miles in Midnight Cowboy.  Like, not bad.  Not bad.  This scenario may be something that plays out in your head like that.  Do you think she smacks her ass?  No.  To see it just go.  A little bit.  To see what's going on.  Oh yeah, I got it. 
[02:51:00]  No, she doesn't.  I'm sure she doesn't.  And then the lotion.  I got it.  Then the lotion.  My money maker looks good.  Then she's got a lotion all over.  And as she goes with the lotion down from thigh to foot, she's standing straight up.  So if anybody is behind, they're getting a view.  Nobody's behind.  No.  It doesn't happen.  Well, let's say this imaginary father is there with a handlebar mustache.  This isn't sound imaginary at all.  Nah, it's completely imaginary.  That changed a little bit.  Jesus.  Oh, okay.  He's got a Hitler mustache. 
[02:51:30]  I don't know anybody like that.  See?  It's not you.  He's got the taft.  And then she wraps herself up in a little towel.  It's a little too short.  Oh.  And walks out of the bathroom.  You know why, right, Sam?  You know why.  And walks out of the bathroom.  No, I don't know why.  And goes like, oh.  And then, you know, oops.  I didn't know I wasn't alone.  You're having a party?  Ooh.  Yeah, oh.  Oops, you dropped your mustache wax.  I got to bend down and get it.  Oh, see, now you're making it close to home again.  And then somebody puts on Bobby Darin's Splish Splash. 
[02:52:00]  I was taking a bath and everybody laughs.  That's very romantic.  What?  My mom's still on the phone.  Oh.  Hi, Bobby.  Do you like that scenario?  Sorry.  Oh, sorry.  I forgot your response.  Ah.  She was looking up recipes.  I see what you're doing.  Actually.  For the make good treats.  There's no make good.  Could you imagine if she was there?  See how hard Anthony had to work right there?  She had unbuckled her pants.  What are you talking about? 
[02:52:30]  She was listening to that story just completely.  You're not doing the imaginary one anymore.  No, no.  Okay.  I'm not.  Yeah.  But it goes back to my point.  You see how hard Anthony had to work there because she's not giving details about her showering hat.  That deserves peach cobbler.  Do you understand what's going on here?  Do you understand?  That's why she owes us pies.  That's cookies.  No.  Because you know what?  This is your job.  You're supposed to be doing a radio show.  She was supposed to make it easy for us today.  Our job is not to make fun of your mom like this. 
[02:53:00]  And I apologize profusely, Bobby.  I was just hoping, Sam, that none of your buddies that I've known since third grade are listening to this show today.  No, I'm sure they are.  I have friends who my mother gave sandwiches to us.  Bobby, can you at least be honest and admit that you didn't give us what we were hoping for today?  I'm sure I did not.  And that's a big disappointment to our listeners now, isn't it? 
[02:53:30]  Pink or brown?  Pink or brown?  What?  What?  What is that in reference to?  Licorice.  You know by now when you call me, you're not.  They do.  It's chocolate licorice.  Bleached or no?  What?  T-shirts.  T-shirts?  What difference does it make?  It gets all the stains out.  Why are you even asking?  I don't know.  No, it's just questions that you ask a mom.  I don't think that's questions that you ask anyone's mom. 
[02:54:00]  Heart-shaped or bald?  What is that?  Her pussy.  Oh, my God.  No, see.  Now that's just, Bobby, I've got to apologize.  And she's not going to think that's charming.  No, that's not charming.  Bobby, I apologize.  I do have the utmost respect for you.  I was playing the same game these guys were playing.  No, no, no, no.  I was playing the same game they were playing, Sam.  No, you weren't.  I certainly was.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Jim and Ed did just-  I was playing the same game.  Ed told a story about an imaginary person. 
[02:54:30]  Yes.  Jim talked about lotion.  Ed talked about licorice.  And you bring up what you bring up.  I was playing the choice game like they were playing.  No.  I was doing the exact same thing.  And you're the one who's going to end up probably seeing my mother in person.  And that's going to be uncomfortable for you.  The next barbecue is going to be really awkward.  Oh, I'm not allowed?  I mean, you usually say that you want to stay out of Westchester.  What am I, uh, insert your old girlfriend here.  Do you want to come down to Westchester for the next barbecue?  Best Chester.  Yeah.  It's great.  How about you, Jim?  Where is that, by the way? 
[02:55:00]  Where's Westchester?  How far?  From here?  An hour.  An hour?  It's 25 minutes.  When's the next barbecue?  Listen, if you guys are coming, next barbecue is whenever you're available.  All right.  We'll have an Opie and Anthony Show barbecue this weekend.  But you've got to eat like an eight-year-old and everyone has to fucking...  You don't have to eat like an eight-year-old.  How do you barbecue chicken nuggets?  You don't.  You just barbecue chicken.  Bobby?  I had barbecue chicken at the compound.  It was delicious.  Grill Master Danny made it.  Grill Master Danny was amazing.  Amazing.  What about beef?  You don't eat beef, but do you serve it? 
[02:55:30]  Do you have it on the barbecue?  No.  Yes.  So everyone has to suffer?  No.  They only serve what Sam likes.  Bobby?  Yep.  Told you.  No.  My father will barbecue all types of meats.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, wait.  Please remember, you guys.  Curtains?  One of you in particular, that at our house, we don't serve alcohol to minors.  That's right.  Oh, no.  You know what she just did there?  She just made...  Took a shot at you.  A shot at me. 
[02:56:00]  She took a shot at you.  I understand.  And he was being nice, Bobby.  I understand.  He was being...  Took a shot at you.  I like that.  That's okay, though.  You know something, Bobby?  Touché.  Touché.  I hear you.  You have no idea it was being nice, and you took that cheap shot.  That's okay, though.  I mean, I don't know if you...  I've got a lot of stuff I need to get back, so he's only being nice for a very short time.  She's so sharp.  Yeah.  She really is sharp.  She knows this show all too well. 
[02:56:30]  She listens every morning.  God.  I'm going to have to send flowers again.  Oh, Bobby.  You've listened to some of the bad stuff we've said?  Bobby, did you get the flowers I sent you?  I sent you flowers the last time I felt guilty about the things I sent to you.  No, no, no.  Last time you felt guilty, you said you were going to send flowers.  I sent them.  Oh, no.  Maybe they went to the wrong address.  Oh.  There were no flowers.  Oh.  Oh, those were from you.  Oh, is that what happened?  Sam intercepted him and went, Mommy, here.  Flowers for you.  There were no flowers at all.  These for you.  Mama, these for you. 
[02:57:00]  Seaweed.  Seaweed and an anemone in the middle.  A sea anemone.  Mama, these for you.  Mama, these for you.  These for you.  So you guys going to come over to my house?  When's the next barbecue?  Yeah, Bobby, when are you barbecuing for us?  Anything you want.  When?  Well, you've got to get the pies and the cookies, the make good treats.  When does that happen?  Next week?  Yeah, I can do that.  I'll do it.  Bobby, can I ask you a question?  Of course you will, Sam. 
[02:57:30]  Can I ask you a question, Bobby?  Let's say I went over there, but I really, I was rushed for time, and I wasn't able to  shower a change.  Would I be able to use your doorless shower just to clean up a little bit?  No.  Yes!  Oh, come on now.  Different showers.  But it would be totally innocent.  It sounds like you got the better of the showers in the house.  It was just recently redone.  Yeah, see?  And I think if I'm company, that would be the best thing for me to do. 
[02:58:00]  No, you would have to use the guest shower, I'm afraid.  The guest shower?  I'd rub it.  Yeah.  I'd rub it on everything she owns.  Oh, rub what?  See, you're getting back at her now.  Oh, you know.  You know.  For the cheap shot.  My dude.  That's a very cheap shot.  You're right.  Yeah, well, we were all keeping it fun, but Anthony has to go a little too far now.  She'd never quite be sure about the conditioner anymore.  No.  She'd be like, oh.  You'll have to shower at the compound before you come.  All right. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  That was keeping it fun before.  Sorry, Bobby.  I'm sorry.  Bobby, what kind of games do we get to play at the barbecue?  Oh, my God.  At the barbecue.  Mom, you have to make invitations for me to bring in to Opie and Anthony and Jim.  And set a date for the barbecue.  I think your mom should come out of a cake.  Make invitations?  Like vaudeville.  The barbecue.  Yeah, you have to make invitations for the barbecue.  Barbecue.  Okay.  Well, I'll do that all right.  Okay. 
[02:59:00]  Okay.  Okay now.  Okay.  Well, Bobby, you're just an amazing woman.  You're an inspiration to us all.  You've raised fine children.  That have never been in any, you know, real trouble.  The responsible, smart.  You're quite the mom.  You've been there for them.  Cooking, cleaning, toiling.  And you hung in there so long.  I'm going to ask you a real question.  Shaving.  Oh, good.  No, this is where we show another side.  You got Sam.  This is where we make it so you take our call next time. 
[02:59:30]  You got Sam.  Very talented kid.  Creative kid.  Working his balls off for Sirius XM.  He has five radio shows.  That's amazing.  And he's making no money.  Yeah.  How do you feel about that?  Very proud.  Oh.  Watch the claws come out.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Bobby.  Wait.  Wait.  What's the question?  Oh, boy.  Your little boy is way underpaid for everything he's doing for this company.  Yeah.  How do you feel about that?  Well, I feel like you guys in Sirius have given him wonderful opportunities. 
[03:00:00]  Oh.  And he has lived up and far exceeded.  To experience things like starvation.  And I'm sure the money you need to follow at any time now.  Oh, really?  How do you feel?  I think.  I'm going to be very unhappy.  She wants Sam to step over your dead bodies walking to television.  Exactly.  I think what Obie's asking.  I've got to say, I hope it's really soon because I know Tina Fey would be very interested. 
[03:00:30]  That Tina Fey.  Boy, she knows Tina Fey is looking for someone like you.  But, Bobby, how do you feel that the last time you brought this up, about a month and a half ago, Sam sort of got in trouble.  I'm speaking for what I observed.  Sam got in trouble because he didn't come to the bosses and he brought it to the air.  And the bosses actually said that he needs to go to them more often to ask for a raise, something like once a week.  And that's been about a month and a half ago.  Maybe Bobby should do that.  And nothing has happened.  Maybe Bobby should do that. 
[03:01:00]  Call once a week.  Maybe you should send some pies or something to the.  Yeah.  Butter them up.  Pies like at the end of thinner.  That's a very good plan.  I'll send them a pie.  Sam, have you gone to the bosses once a week like they told you to?  Because you weren't going to them enough to ask for the raise.  Remember that?  Nobody told me to go once a week.  It was just a matter of making sure that I made an effort to communicate with them more often.  And not bring things straight to the air without giving them a chance. 
[03:01:30]  But you only have to communicate to the bosses once.  I'm underpaid.  I need more money.  Right.  So they should get the message.  If they don't give you money, it's not going to have changed the next week.  Right.  You're not going to change what your feelings are about the situation.  So why do you have to keep going down the hall to tell him, look, once again, I'm reminding you, I'm underpaid and underappreciated here.  That's ridiculous.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  If he got in trouble before for discussing this on the air, how come you guys are bringing it up on the air?  Oh.  No. 
[03:02:00]  Sam's staying out of this.  Because we can't get in trouble for it.  I try to look out for Sam a little bit.  He's staying out of this.  It's ridiculous that this kid doesn't have more money.  It's ridiculous.  Well.  And their excuse was, oh, you got to come to us more often and express how you feel.  When you work for a company and you feel like you're underpaid and underappreciated, all you have to do is tell them once.  And they should get the fucking message and either tell you to go fuck yourself or do the right thing and give you more money.  This is Bobby.  Watch your language. 
[03:02:30]  End of discussion.  Sam shouldn't have to keep reminding them that he's underpaid and underappreciated.  And I feel bad almost, like, when we travel, that, like, Sam's not getting paid.  And there they are, flying me first class and putting me in a hotel suite.  Why are you bringing it up, then?  Oh, you're saying that I kind of feel guilty about.  Kind of?  Yeah, those things.  Why don't you just not sit, bring me up, not sit first class, sit by me.  I hope all of the authority figures who are listening to this realize that it's not Sam's fault.  He didn't bring this up.  He's not talking about it. 
[03:03:00]  It's just you guys.  Oh, wow.  You're getting nervous.  It's all on us.  It's not Sam's fault.  Bobby, it's all on us.  I promise you.  Mom!  I'm not going to lower it.  I have to do this now.  Mom, please stop calling me.  This is where Sam's heading.  A podcast in his mom's basement.  I have to get paid properly.  I have opened new lines of communications and spoken to various people various times since the incident in question.  And can I tell you, things are moving in a positive direction. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, really?  You're not being fired?  That's positive here.  Maybe.  No, I bring this up again because the lovely Sam and the lovely Jess decide they needed a little romantic getaway.  And I was asking Sam about it a little bit because I care about what he's doing when he's not doing radio.  And he couldn't stay in Cape Cod an extra night because he can't afford it.  So why don't you tell Jimmy and Ant what you had to do?  Well, we were going to Cape Cod for the long weekend.  How many hours is it to get to Cape Cod? 
[03:04:00]  Who are you, a fucking Kennedy?  You don't go to Cape Cod?  How many of you are?  Seaside Heights, you white trash.  How many of you are?  You should go to Cape Cod.  You went to Hyannisport like you's fucking highfalutin'.  How many hours is it to Cape Cod?  It's key to the story.  Yeah, that's when we drove to P-Town.  Right.  So P-Town took five hours.  All right, so four or five hours, safe to say.  Yeah.  He wanted to go for the weekend, right?  Yeah, so we drove up on Friday morning straight to P-Town. 
[03:04:30]  And then that way we could get Friday from like one o'clock.  What's P-Town?  Provincetown.  Oh, Provincetown, okay.  It's an extremely gay part of Cape Cod.  Oh, yeah.  But also very artsy.  Yeah, it was fun.  And there's lots to do there.  So you rode up in the morning, five-hour drive.  No, here's the key.  He took Friday off so he could have a romantic weekend with his girl.  Yeah.  But he couldn't leave Thursday because he couldn't afford a hotel room for Thursday night.  So what him and his lovely soon-to-be bride did, now I'm going serious. 
[03:05:00]  Fuck all that fun stuff we did.  He had to leave first thing in the morning, Friday morning, drive all day to get an extra  day out of his long weekend.  How much is it wrong?  Bullshit.  It's not his couple hundred bucks problem.  Yeah, it was under 200.  But he can't afford that.  And these guys are like, oh, you're not asking us enough about a raise.  Steal.  Yeah.  I could run.  Steal it.  We're living in your means.  Stop going and trying to make fancy new friends.  Stop wearing a sweater around your neck trying to be a gentleman.  Stop eating in lobster houses. 
[03:05:30]  He could have left Thursday nice, get up there comfortably, and have a hotel room.  Bobby, nothing in the cookie jar that you might have been able to throw him to let him  have that extra day?  I don't ask my mom for money.  Oh, she could offer.  Sam and his mother had the relationship like Gator and Ruby Dee did in Jungle Fever.  Oh, wow.  Comes at all high and dances.  Sells off their possessions.  Yeah, sells off their shit.  And they get shot at the end.  I will say again, though, I have opened up lines of communication better, and things 
[03:06:00]  are moving in a positive direction within the company.  That was said months ago.  Nonsense.  Fucking just do it.  You know what?  Instead of doing this on the air, why don't all three of you guys go to these people off  the air and put in your words?  How about that?  Does that entail doing anything after 10 a.m.?  Do you know we're big stars, Bobby?  What's wrong with you?  Bobby, I thought you listened to this show.  Now we're mad at Bobby again.  I thought you knew us.  Unless that meeting is taking place within 36 floors of an elevator ride, no can do. 
[03:06:30]  Hey, man, what can I say?  I would have paid for your whole vacation thing there, the whole weekend.  I mean, I appreciate that.  I would have.  Uh-huh.  For one naked picture of Jess.  Well, I wouldn't give you that.  Jesus.  I wouldn't have given it to you.  I was just asking.  Why can't I offer?  Well, I appreciate the offer, but Jess would do that.  It's not like that movie with a million bucks to have sex and, you know. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  It's just a nice little weekend away for a picture.  Is that an indecent proposal?  It's somewhat.  It's a somewhat indecent proposal.  It's like, I'll pay for your vacation.  I'll pay for your P-Town rooms and your fucking highfalutin vacation.  Hyannisport.  Hyannisport vacation.  Just one nude picture.  I would have.  I appreciate the offer.  Oh, thank you.  But I would have declined it.  Ah, see.  Isn't it a little sleazy?  No, it's probably a lot sleazy, Bobby. 
[03:07:30]  But, you know, who wouldn't want to see that?  She's a pretty girl, like you say.  I think Sam's very lucky.  Well, I am lucky.  But they're making progress on something they should just do automatically.  So that's good news.  At least we got that out today.  Things are in a positive place.  Do you think somewhere Jess is going like, fucking asshole should take that goddamn money?  No, no.  Really?  I don't think Jess would like it if you had nude pictures.  Or if there were nude pictures of her in general.  Do you think she's tweeting me right now with a picture just to say, look, send the money here? 
[03:08:00]  No, she doesn't have an address.  She doesn't have Twitter.  What about Facebook?  She has Facebook.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to check that.  And you got money on you?  I got money on me.  I got plenty of money.  Sam needs money, Bobby.  You guys want to go to L.A.?  I'll put you at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  We love L.A.  One naked picture.  No, look.  You know, we don't have Jess.  We have Bobby on the phone.  So you want a naked picture of Bobby?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I'm not saying that, Anthony.  You're saying that, Bobby.  He said.  Bobby, $100 for me and $100 for a man that goes right to Sam. 
[03:08:30]  What would you do right now on the phone?  Right now on the phone, what would you do?  Keep going.  First of all, Bobby.  She's not doing shit for $200.  I know damn well there's some black and white Polaroid of you naked somewhere.  Oh, my God.  Of course there is.  Like Dr. Laura.  Every woman has taken nude pics of themselves and never had the heart to really throw them away.  And you hide them somewhere, right?  I'm not cheap, you guys.  But she didn't answer the picture question.  It's in that special drawer.  Yes. 
[03:09:00]  There's a picture of you.  You know, the go-to drawer.  Yeah.  There's no go-to drawer.  Of course there is.  That has a few other things in there.  Sure it does.  Looking like Barbie Benton.  What's in your go-to drawer?  I would guess something that vibrates.  Yeah, there's got to be.  Oh, it'll be.  It's a massager, though.  It's for your shoulders.  I'm thinking maybe a joint that has a little roach.  A little roach.  Something that looks like Howard's logo.  Howard's logo is a fist.  Wow, way to really make it hurt. 
[03:09:30]  That would have went over her head.  You sick fuck, Sam.  Pieces.  All right, let's not talk about the go-to drawer.  The go-to drawer.  I've always had a tough time.  Have you ever, has Sam ever looked, Sam, have you ever looked in Bobby's night table drawer?  Oh.  I've looked in her drawers before when I was younger.  What'd you find?  Looking for presents.  What'd you find?  There was nothing scandalous in any of those.  Did you wonder why your rocket ship model makeup was in the drawer? 
[03:10:00]  Model rocket ship?  I never had a rocket ship.  He was young.  He was looking for gifts.  And he's like, why is my model rocket ship?  It looks like a model rocket ship.  Oh, that engine sounds weird.  It's a model.  A variable propulsion.  I thought we were being nice.  Weren't we being nice before?  We were.  But there is a go-to drawer.  Of course there is.  Or a box inside a closet or something.  Not that I'm aware of, for damn sure.  And there's pictures in there. 
[03:10:30]  There's Polaroids.  Yeah.  Black and white Polaroids.  I don't think so.  Where she's doing sexy poses.  Your mom do your laundry?  Yeah.  Does she throw a bunch of sneakers in?  What?  Oh, uneven load.  She does.  Do you do one?  Lonely women at home love the uneven load on the washer because it makes the washer shake  back and forth.  And they can lean against it.  My mother's not lonely.  You know, do you guys know it's 10 o'clock?  Oh, it's time to get out of here.  Bobby, thank you so much.  Take care.  She's a genius. 
[03:11:00]  Have a great Wednesday.  We'll see you all tomorrow.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The virus. </pre>
