<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a barrage of advertisements for various sponsors including Carbonite, The UPS Store, Power Swabs, Grasshopper, Instaflex, DraftKings, Beezid, Nadex Binary Options, Simply To Impress, HydroCare, Carfax, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, and the Joe Rogan Experience, interspersed with promotional spots for SiriusXM channels and programming, particularly the Ron and Fez show and the impending "Worst of the Week" countdown.

The show then launched into a "Worst of the Week" countdown hosted by Sam Roberts.  This segment began with a call from Roland, the show's talent booker, who dramatically detailed his debilitating gastrointestinal distress after consuming a truly grotesque cheeseburger creation, providing a highly graphic description of his symptoms.  This was followed by a humorous aside about multiple plane landings affected by strong winds.  Next, Jim Brewer joined the show in studio to share amusing anecdotes about his teenage daughter's social media obsession and burgeoning romantic interests, contrasting her behavior with his other daughters’ more tomboyish natures. He described his wife's exasperated reaction and his own tactics for confiscating his daughter's phone.

A particularly offensive segment followed, showcasing a recovered 1989 VHS tape of Opie and another individual’s crude and lecherous commentary while watching women visit Sam Kinison in the studio. Their commentary was filled with objectification and repeated use of the term "gobble queen," along with other sexually explicit language.

The broadcast then shifted to a vulgar discussion of a video featuring a woman, possibly a catering hall waitress, at an event.  The hosts and co-hosts engaged in extensive sexually explicit commentary about her appearance, using terms like "tits," "titties," "hooters," and "gobble queen,"  and making crude jokes.  They also mocked a man in the video attempting to interact with her.

The tone abruptly changed as the show transitioned to a discussion of Ota Benga, a Congolese pygmy displayed at the Bronx Zoo in the early 1900s.  A historical account was read, followed by a discussion of its ethical implications and the broader historical context of similar displays, such as the "Hottentot Venus."  Comedian Bill Burr then called in, sharing anecdotes from his recent trip to Italy, including visits to the Sistine Chapel and the Coliseum.

The "Worst of the Week" countdown continued with a detailed, comedic analysis of a Chris Angel magic trick involving a disappearing elephant. The hosts and Sam meticulously dissected the video, proposing that the trick was achieved through camera editing and audience complicity.  This was followed by Jim Brewer's recounting of his family’s African safari experience with James Hetfield of Metallica, detailing terrifying encounters with hyenas, an elephant charge, a hippopotamus, and the Hazda tribe. This segment concluded with a discussion of a breakdown experienced by Fez from the "Ron and Fez" show, possibly stemming from a listener call on Jim Brewer's advice segment that revealed personal details about Fez's life.

The show then focused on the internal conflicts within the Ron and Fez radio show, using audio clips highlighting Fez's erratic and agitated behavior and Ron's exasperation. A caller's bizarre childhood anecdote, initially dismissed as fake, was followed by a tense exchange between the Opie and Anthony hosts and audio clips of Ron and Fez. Fez expressed frustration and paranoia about perceived conspiracies against him.  The discussion was punctuated by listener calls, comedic moments, and a Mrs. Fields cookie read by Fez during a commercial break.  Patton Oswalt appeared as a guest towards the end of this segment.

Finally, the show addressed the entertainment industry, focusing on auditions and the challenges faced by comedians and actors.  A comedian guest (unnamed) discussed the unfairness of reality competition formats like *Last Comic Standing*, sharing anecdotes about their own experiences, including an audition for *Young Adult* and involvement with *Comedians of Comedy*.  The conversation touched upon network pressures for specific demographic quotas, the difficulty of judging comedic talent, the industry's focus on "freaks," and the challenges of maintaining an online presence in the modern media landscape.  The challenges of law enforcement keeping up with modern technology were also briefly discussed.

When we were considering  opening a franchise business,  my wife and I had a lot of questions.  Yeah, like what are the investment costs? 
[00:03:30]  What about marketing and training?  Which franchises are well-known and respected?  But when we learned about the UPS store,  all of our concerns went away.  Because not only is the UPS store brand  powered by UPS,  they've been franchising for over 30 years  and are still growing.  And the investment was reasonable too.  Startup costs were lower  than other franchises we looked at.  And we had customers  the day we opened our doors.  Our business is right on track.

[00:10:30]  A call from Bill Burr,  a trip back in time  to 1989,  and a whole lot more  on Friday,  Roland,  our own Roland,  he's the talent booker  for the Opie and Anthony show.  He's a foodie,  which means he just  eats all the time,  and he was not at work.  He sent the most insane  I'm sick letter  to the weirdest combination  of people who work  for the Opie and Anthony show  to announce on Friday  that he wasn't going to be there,  so we got him on the phone  to explain his tummy troubles 
[00:11:00]  to us.  Starting the countdown,  Roland and his sick day.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  Roro.  Hello.  Roro,  we got your email.  I want to read it again  to everybody.  You sent it.  I know.  You sent it to Travis,  and you cc Don Wicklin  and Sal. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I want to start there.  Why those guys?  Don Wicklin and Sal.  I thought I did cc Sam  and Travis  because of the key track,  but I was thinking  of shit at the time.  Yeah,  I don't care.  It's just a weird combination  of people  to send this email to.  No.  It says,  hello.  I'll read this.  It says,  hello.  I've been on the shitter 
[00:12:00]  for more than half the night  already.  I am down for the count.  Not feeling well.  I'm walking like John Wayne  now after all the TP I used.  Ta-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  He's walking like John Wayne.  Ta-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  I hate that.  Fuck, I forgot what that was.  That's too crap.  Yeah, I'll figure it out.  I'm going to see, but as of now, I'm staying home tomorrow.  I need home base to relax as I poo. 
[00:12:30]  I think it's the flu.  Lou, I'm sweating like manic because of the fever I have.  Roland.  Did you mean to write, I'm sweating like a maniac?  Probably, but my shoe was coming out so fast.  My shoe was what?  What happened?  The shit.  Oh.  I know.  So what, you got the food poisoning?  I don't know.  I mean, my ass was like, I thought it was melting.  Everything was coming out.  Yeah, that's food poisoning, I think, right?  Yeah, and then last night, I was like, right in the bathroom, shit myself, and then I 
[00:13:00]  had to take a shower.  Sorry, we're distracted by a plane having a real rough time trying to land.  They're showing missed approaches and fucking landings where the wind is blowing them sideways,  and they're like, oh.  Oh, that's more than one plane?  Oh, yeah, two different.  Aborted landings, two different ones.  Oh, wow.  Well, yeah, the one said, fuck that.  This is going to crash if I go any further.  But it looked like you had the wheels down.  Yeah, he was ready to land.  No, I mean, it looked like the wheels touched, and then he said, no way, I've got to push 
[00:13:30]  this back up.  I'm sideways.  Yeah.  One was a prop, and then one was like a real 737 or whatever.  It's that windy over there, huh?  That's crazy.  Roland, what happened to you yesterday?  Can you take us through it?  Sam and I left work and said, do you want to have lunch?  I said, sure.  And we had lunch, and on the subway ride home, I started sweating so much, and then I almost  shit myself.  I almost shit himself.  Well, that's food poisoning. 
[00:14:00]  What kind of food did you have?  I had a burger.  No, you don't just have a burger.  What kind of burger did Roro have?  I told him where we went, Roro.  Oh, I had a burger.  It was a cheeseburger.  It wasn't pedestrian, was it?  No, it was a cheeseburger with mac and cheese, like a little bit of it.  On the burger?  Yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  See, that's why I said he doesn't just have a burger. 
[00:14:30]  These foodies always have to add a little something more.  A little something.  Wait, so it's a burger that has a little mac and cheese on it.  That actually sounds pretty good.  Yeah, cheese and bacon.  It was delicious.  And bacon.  Oh, my God.  It's delicious.  That might just be a normal shitting after eating something like that with all that grease.  Right.  You got mac and cheese, greasy bacon, and a hamburger.  That is just sitting in there coagulating. 
[00:15:00]  Wait, and a what?  Buffalo fries.  And buffalo fries.  Buffalo fries.  You can't sit at the table.  Of course your ass hurts.  For the table.  Let me order some buffalo fries for the table.  Of course your asshole hurts.  Yeah, yeah, I didn't expect it.  I mean, I don't think it's a food.  I don't know what it is.  I just can't stop shitting.  I would so repel, by the way.  Now we're looking at...  Oh, they're repelling off the side of the building.  That view is scaring me.  I would repel.  That I could do.  My brother asked me just the other day if I want to go skydiving, and for the hundredth 
[00:15:30]  time in my life, I said,  Oh, henna.  Oh, henna.  Henna.  You have fun with that.  Yeah.  Skydiving, no fucking way.  I would repel down the side of a building.  I don't know what you're supposed to do.  How do you stop yourself?  You're just falling.  Once you've got that grip down, you figure out that brake system, you're all right.  What if you don't figure it out?  You'll be all right.  You've got to figure it out.  You'll be all right.  You're pretty good anyway.  Yeah, you'll figure it out.  Because you're squeezing. 
[00:16:00]  A speed brake on it.  Because I think you squeeze to release, so as long as you let go, it's going to break you.  Oh, you're squeezing when you...  Oh, I see.  I believe so.  That's how that would work.  And he's got guys around him helping him, right?  Yeah.  But when you get good at it, then you can kind of bounce off the side of the building.  You get like two bounces, you're down an entire fucking building a lot of times.  They know how to go down real fast when they're away from the wall, and then slow down real  fast again.  And before, you know, you're on the fucking ground.  How do we get some repelling done? 
[00:16:30]  How do we do that?  Is there a place we could go?  I'm sure we'll get some milk to it.  I want to start slow, obviously.  We can't get the fucking phones fixed.  We're never going to get a repelling done.  All right.  Let's repell down the side of this building.  That'd be cool.  All right.  Anyway, so you had a hamburger with mac and cheese, bacon, and a side order of buffalo  fries.  Buffalo fries.  And also caramelized onions.  On the burger?  Yeah.  Caramel onions.  Oh, okay.  And what were you drinking?  I officially can't say it's food poisoning. 
[00:17:00]  That could just be your stomach going, what the fuck?  What did you wash down this goodness with?  Club soda.  Club soda.  Is that your drink of choice?  Yeah.  I know.  Why?  To keep the palate nice and clear for you?  Yes, sir.  See?  I think it is a foodie thing.  So we can distinguish between the buffalo fries and the caramelized onions of the mac  and cheeseburger.  How was the food? 
[00:17:30]  The what?  How was the food?  It was good.  Yeah, they do a good job over there.  Now, we're saying Guy Fieri, he might not come in.  Why is that?  Yeah, is Guy Fieri coming in?  Yeah, just his schedule is flipping.  Or did he hear some audio from the past?  We've always been pleasant.  We like the Guy Fieri.  Or when he got into a fight with his hairdresser.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So, you got it bad, huh? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I ate some bread, so I wouldn't shit in 40 minutes.  So if I don't shit, another shit.  Bread does that?  Roro, you could still participate in the show today.  Do us a favor of, if you're going to go back in the bathroom, you've got to call us.  All right.  All right?  You know what I'm saying?  It sounds like a murder.  I know.  We want to hear that explosion into the bowl.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Could you do us that favor?  I just got a new iPhone 5S.  I am?  You just got what? 
[00:18:30]  A new iPhone.  It's going to have caca on it.  Oh, you're worried about your new phone getting caca on it?  Yeah.  It's caca-proof.  Yeah, it'll be fine.  Yeah, you'll be all right.  I'll put a baggie around it.  It's not going to get any flecks of shit on it.  You'll be all right.  Put that right on the sink, and then we listen in.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I hope you feel better.  The worst of the week.  Countdown continues.  Countdown is moving right along. 
[00:19:00]  It's me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, what a week of radio.  We still got to highlight Bill Burr on the phone, Fez having a breakdown on the Ron and Fez show,  Chris Angel, and analyzing his magic.  Otabanga.  If you missed the Otabanga saga, wait until you hear the Otabanga saga.  That's all I'll say.  Right now, I want to get to Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer was in studio.  He was in for a while.  He'll appear later on this countdown as well.  But first, I wanted to play for you his teenage daughter story. 
[00:19:30]  He's got a teenage daughter, and she's just starting to date and all this stuff.  Jim Brewer is one of the best storytellers that we have here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  He did not disappoint when he was in this week.  It's Jim Brewer and another story on the worst of the week.  Countdown.  Good Lord.  So, and then, how's the daughters?  I'm trying to catch up with Brewer.  It's been a while. 
[00:20:00]  They're really good.  The next...  What are the ages again?  14.  I know you told me all fair, but just three people.  I'm trying to keep them from dating.  Right.  14, 11, and 8.  The 8-year-old is 8.  11-year-old is...  What does an 8-year-old do?  Let's go up the...  Mine is full-blown tomboy.  She's bow and arrows, cuts knives.  Wow.  Pocket knives, hangs out with boys.  She will not wear chick clothes at all. 
[00:20:30]  She's into rock.  That's pretty normal at that age, though, right?  Yeah.  She's into rock, metal.  She wears metal stud plates now.  Really?  At 8?  I totally corrupted her.  That was funny.  What kind of music does she like?  She likes ACDC.  No kidding.  Yeah, she likes ACDC.  An 8-year-old.  Yeah.  You'd be surprised.  The 8-year-old, ACDC.  And then 11-year-old is...  She's, you know... 
[00:21:00]  Katy Perry, blah, blah.  But the 14-year-old...  That's...  It's...  That's a world that I guess I lived in.  They literally only exist in their world.  Nothing else exists.  And it's a lot...  This is minor, but social media is a big problem because she won't get her work done. 
[00:21:30]  She'll sit there on a freaking iPad or whatever, like a junkie.  And you give it to her.  She's like...  Take it away from me!  Like, what are you doing?  I'm Snapchatting!  It's really bizarre.  And then, you know, and she's constantly showing you, like, Todd, Snapchatting, this funny...  All right, all right.  Snapchatting.  It's exciting.  This is Lina's Instagram?  So, we came up with this...  We came up with this rule, like, listen, 10 o'clock at night, it's over. 
[00:22:00]  Give me that thing.  If you don't give it to me, I come in and take it.  Okay, okay.  Go in there, and she hides it under the bed.  So, while she's under the bed, you come in at, like, 10.30, like, what are you doing?  No, no, it's sleeping.  You open up, and there she is with the...  And you go, give me that.  And then they don't go...  My wife...  This is why I can't have guns in the house, because she would shoot one of them.  She really would.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  She's got hormonal...  She's a maniac with the...  I mean, she goes from zero to 140, and she just...  She takes off the door hinge, and she's like, yeah, it's...  So, she walks in...  Oh, you've taken the door off?  Oh, yeah, all the time.  I've had that happen when I was a kid.  All the time.  Door's taken off.  Everything's unplugged.  She had to sleep in the living room for, like, a month, this kid.  So, she goes in there.  She's under the covers.  Are you on Instagram?  No. 
[00:23:00]  Pull the covers away.  There she is, the thing.  And the kid don't get it.  Instead of going, all right, sorry.  She puts her face...  She puts her hand out.  She goes, wait!  Just wait!  I'm not...  Just wait!  Oh, no.  And, you know...  Well, you don't care.  I'll cut your hair.  And, like, listen.  Meatball.  Think of a bank robber.  I come in, and...  Okay, everyone, hands up.  You don't...  You don't go, wait.  Let me finish putting the money in the bag. 
[00:23:30]  It's over.  You're caught.  Put the money down.  Put your hands in the air.  Right, right.  Put your face down on the ground.  There is no...  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Just hold on.  I'm not done stealing.  So, there is...  Oh, my God.  You're dealing a little...  I have to look forward to.  Yeah, have fun.  No dating.  Hey, listen.  No dating.  Uh-oh.  I don't care if...  What you say is you're no dating.  You're 14.  Well, so-and-so dating.  I don't care about so-and-so.  I wasn't allowed to date in high school. 
[00:24:00]  My mom made it a major fucking issue.  No dating.  They're too stupid.  They're 14.  I don't know what they're doing.  I don't know what they're doing.  She wants to date, though, huh?  Yeah, so...  Are her friends dating?  A couple of them, yeah.  That makes it tough, right?  They start at, like, 12.  So, then you have to deal with that shit.  Yes.  You have to start waiting friends out.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You...  This one's out.  Just out, out.  I know this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, can I hang out with this family?  No.  No.  It's over.  It's over. 
[00:24:30]  Because...  No.  Wow.  Because your kids are out there banging.  No.  The eyeliner's on the face.  That's it.  It's over.  Once the eyeliner starts getting in, it means they're hunting.  They're looking for something.  They're hunting.  Oh, no.  And they show up quick.  Tang, tang, tang, tang, tang, tang, tang.  Oh, God.  Can your daughter hang out?  No.  You've had that?  She can't.  No, I honestly haven't.  Oh, wow.  But I've seen it with the other kids.  I had a New Year's Eve thing last year, two years ago, like 12 years old. 
[00:25:00]  I left the kids alone for like 15 minutes and people were sucking face.  Oh, man.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Jesus Christ.  I'm not going to call your parents.  Did you call the parents?  Yeah.  Where'd you go for 15 minutes?  They were just waiting for you to leave.  They were just waiting for me to turn the corner.  Dry hum and sucking face.  What are you doing?  But that's what we all did at parties.  And that's the thing.  Like, I do remember it.  But even then, I was too scared in someone else's house. 
[00:25:30]  I'd rather do it behind a garage or something like that.  Oh, that's funny, dude.  So I called the parents.  I'm like, listen, you're a 12-year-old sucking face.  Oh, my God.  He's got his hand.  I just need you to know so you don't think I'm allowing this.  Right.  You want me to pick her up?  No.  Maybe she talked to her about condoms and getting banged.  I'm just saying.  She's with a 15-year-old boy.  I'm just saying.  I thought you might want to know.  I'm just giving you a heads up.  But they're bummed because they don't want to go get the kid. 
[00:26:00]  And that's it.  They don't care.  They're just like, oh, man.  I got my buzz on.  You really got it?  You really got it?  All right.  I'll see what I can do.  I'll get her porno off her thing again.  I wouldn't know I'm fucking.  Oh, dude.  Kids cut each other?  They cut each other?  What do you mean cut?  Girls cut themselves.  Oh, the cutters?  The cutting thing's becoming big, huh?  That wasn't a thing when we were growing up.  What is it, like a blood bond?  Like that?  No, they cut themselves for attention.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I never heard of that. 
[00:26:30]  We haven't had this growing up.  I used to do it.  But we didn't have it growing up.  Seriously?  I was drinking, yeah.  I was a teenager, 16, 17.  Are you kidding, Jimo?  Yeah, I'm all cut up.  Look at that fucking mess.  You used to cut yourself?  Oh, yeah.  I was a fucking.  Before emo was popular, I was a little attention douche.  Oh, God.  I was a little emo.  Before emo.  But how did that become popular?  Yeah, well, how do you get from, all right, where did you discover that?  You had to see it somewhere.  Where do you go, oh, my God, I'm going to drink.  I'm going to raise it up a level.  I'm just going to cut something. 
[00:27:00]  I'm just going to start cutting myself.  I don't remember.  I always carry a box cutter, so I thought it made me, to protect myself.  But I just, yeah, I just did it when I was drunk.  I don't remember the first time.  Was it a turn-on in a weird way?  Or like an adrenaline rush?  Yeah, it felt satisfying.  Somehow satisfying.  Yeah.  Wow.  It made everything okay?  Yeah, it just felt like there was results.  I'm like, God, your age, I was tapping pillows.  Someone was pretty bad.  Cut himself.  Yeah.  Wow.  What would you do right after you cut?  I was, it was such an attention thing.  Oh, yeah.  If I wanted to be dead, I'd be dead. 
[00:27:30]  You used to look at all the blood on you and fucking, sometimes I'd go to sleep like  that.  You'd just wake up with it on me.  All over your sheets and stuff?  Oh, you had it on me, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  You had some stuff going on.  Perhaps.  But my point, we're all...  We're all...  Perhaps.  You're just starting to figure that out, bro.

[00:31:30]  It's caused by water, attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.

[00:32:30]  Yes, yes, yes.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You hear me on the Opie and Anthony Show every day.  I also host After Opie and Anthony Live.  Today, I'm here for the Worst of the Week Countdown.  A lot still to come.  More from Jim Brewer in studio.  Fez having a breakdown.  Bill Burr on the phone.  Oda Banga.  Chris Angel and his magic.  And a whole lot more.  Right now, I want to play for you.  Let's go back in time.  Let's get in that DeLorean.  Let's make sure that flux capacitor is working. 
[00:33:00]  Let's get in Mr. Fission.  And let's go back in time.  Let's listen to a tape.  Opie visited his mentor, Brother Weez, up in Rochester.  And got a VHS tape of Sam Kinison in studio with Brother Weez in 1989.  When Opie was just a little radio baby.  But what he found on this tape, even better than the Sam Kinison stuff, was the douchiest combination of people watching as women came into the studio to see Sam Kinison. 
[00:33:30]  We get to hear the commentary on these two douchey guys talking about the girls they see in front of them.  Hilarious stuff.  But if it wasn't hilarious, it wouldn't be played here on The Countdown.  As I'm going through this tape, there were two guys in another studio.  They were filming through the glass.  And there were girls in the studio. 
[00:34:00]  And they were all horned up and creeping on these girls.  But they sounded so fucking pathetic.  What do you mean?  Did they play a part of that?  Did they sound...  And I just cut this up and put it up there.  It has nothing to do with Kinison.  Oh, thank you.  That's the girl.  She faxed it in.  It's got her tattoo of her boyfriend.  Get her out of there.  Get her out of there.  Okay.  Blonde.  I like that blonde right there, man.  She looks fucking...  She looks like a fucking gobble queen.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  Her up the ass. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my boss is sitting there going,  Oh, show us your pet phone.  Let's see.  Oh, man.  She can't talk about it.  I think the blonde is going to do it.  No.  Yeah, she's just...  She just watched her.  Oh, there's Wheeze.  Okay.  And I'm...  Sam's giving her the pressure.  I'll pause.  Yeah.  Pause right there.  That's my midriff above Wheeze's head  in the white sweatshirt right there.  That's me.  Oh, okay.  So I was in there that day.  But I think this video is hilarious  because these guys just start completely losing their minds.  Gobble queen. 
[00:35:00]  Ugh.  I know.  They were being cool by saying that.  Play a little more of it.  I'm looking at all the 80s attire.  And then I...  They're laughing at us.  There's 30 guys in the studio.  They're laughing it up.  Show us your tits.  Show us your tits.  There she's going to.  You can tell.  Come on, honey.  That shirt.  That shirt's got...  That shirt's got fucking titties.  It's a tuxedo shirt.  Come on.  Come on.  That shirt's got titties. 
[00:35:30]  That shirt's got titties.  That shirt's got titties under the shirt.  The shirt.  There's titties under it.  But I'm watching this whole video over the weekend.  And all of a sudden, I just honed on these guys  and how just awful they are.  What D-bags.  Right.  Keep going.  I think it's working.  I don't know.  And she's not even that great.  Then you got that shit.  They got more tits in there than they could fucking count.  Really?  She's good looking.  I like that.  I've got a real sleazy look to her. 
[00:36:00]  She'll be backstage, guaranteed.  She's good looking.  I like that.  That's right.  Oh.  That guy's fucking cool, though.  Yeah, you think so?  Fuck yeah.  She'll be backstage, I guarantee.  Fuck yeah.  We'll see.  But someone on Twitter pointed out over the weekend,  they saw this video,  and the girls in the 80s,  you just couldn't tell how old they were.  Like, how old is that girl?  I don't know.  She's not hot.  She's either 15 or 40.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Do you think she's hot?  No.  No, because the hair is all fucking weird.  It's all 80s hair. 
[00:36:30]  80s hair is awful, right?  It's like...  Yeah, but you know under that shirt is titties.  Do you like this?  Titties under the shirt.  How bad do they sound?  Keep calling that.  It looks like the singer from The Fix.  Right.  She got fully fucking ramped out for this, actually.  Yeah.  No clue.  This is going out for the night.  We get the best room in the fucking place right here.  Sure do.  Do you?  Just the two of us hanging out together.  Just two guys talking about girls like you're 10. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  You know, dude, would you want to, like, jerk me off?  Yeah, yeah.  Talk about a girl in a tuxedo shirt.  You can't...  It's like a fucking waitress shirt.  Yeah, yeah.  A Mater D shirt.  You can't see anything.  Right.  You can't.  It's puffy because it's a bigger shirt.  I'm going to see a pirate.  And then their pants are pulled way too high.  Like, how did we find any of this attractive?  Dude, the 80s were very odd fashion time.  I feel like there's one guy in that room that's like a douche, and he's just the one who keeps  saying all this shit, and the guy next to him is like, oh, I've got to get the fuck 
[00:37:30]  out of this room.  But this is the coolest room in the whole place.  And can we get back to these two dorks in the other room back in 1989?  I think Mike Judge saw this video at some point about the cartoon series.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it is.  It's always over.  They can't get over this girl.  There's like lots of tits in that room.  That shirt's full of tits!  There's no Sam Kitts in this clip.  It was just about these guys. 
[00:38:00]  I had to put this online.  Come on, show us who are hooters.  Hooters.  I'm going to see this naked.  I want to see this woman naked.  I want to see if they get her naked.  I don't think so.  Oh, that's Wee's.  I'll be there.  I'll get my fucking hair trimmed.  What is he talking about?  What did that mean?  She works at a hair cutting studio, so he goes, I'm going to go down there and get my  hair trimmed. 
[00:38:30]  I'm going to get my hair trimmed.  But the best part, he thinks he's killing it.  Oh, yeah.  He thinks he's killing it.  He had to add in an F-bomb.  My fucking hair trimmed.  Trimmed.  What?  I'm going to ask for my butt hair to be trimmed.  That way she'll see my butt.  No, stupid.  And then he said before that, he was like, oh, yeah, she's hot.  I want to see her naked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just...  Where's the game?  Who is this asshole, by the way?  Actually, I remember him as being a cool dude. 
[00:39:00]  That's the sad part.  He's a sales guy.  He's a sales guy.  Yeah.  Oh, sales guy.  Well, I figured.  Yeah, but he was also on air, too.  He was way better than fucking me.  And I guess he chose not to do the on air thing.  Maybe it was all the great fucking shit he blurts out.  Right.  Hey, who's in the naked girls, huh?  I am.  That's one.  Wait till you hear how this ends.  Oh.  Probably the gunshot.  It's just about over.  It's like 30 seconds.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if she's... 
[00:39:30]  Show us your tits.  Show us your tits.  Now.  You know what I'm saying, man?  I'd like to give you the...  I'm like, I'm going to will that fucking shirt off.  Oh, come on.  I don't want to see her.  She's got a nasty skirt.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  What the...  Hello.  Oh, my God.  Nice beaver.  Nice beaver.  Nice beaver.  What movie is that from?  I think that's a movie line, isn't it? 
[00:40:00]  Naked Beaver.  Yeah, Naked Gun.  Was it Naked Gun that did Nice Beaver?  Nice beaver.  I feel like I know where a certain rock DJ got the, hello.  Oh, that's true.  That guy was just like, hello.  I told you I got it from him.  Damn.  So, wait.  That checked you...  Where's the...  How did that video get in?  How did you get that one?  Was it from the station?  What do you mean?  That's not the same video you had on Sam.  Yeah, they decided to, you know...  Just film all day? 
[00:40:30]  They just were filming.  Oh, okay.  So, then they went back to the Sam Kinison stuff, and they kept their fucking mouths quiet,  thank God.  But I couldn't...  I was laughing my ass off everything, man.  I'm like, these fucking losers.  So, I'll do another two or three clips from this.  I'm thinking of just putting the whole videotape up there as one long thing, because you see  downtime, you know, Sam just having a fucking blast, and music's playing, and they're just  shooting the shit, eating donuts, and fucking drinking wine coolers, and...  And a couple of dudes on Beaver Patrol. 
[00:41:00]  That's right.  Beaver.  Nice beaver.  Nice beaver.  I'm going to wheel that shirt off of her, are you?  Are you?  You fucking amazing, amazing man.  I like that shirt, and there's titties under the shirt.  Titties under the shirt.  Yeah, that's usually a shirt that a woman's wearing that hasn't had a problem.  Hey, she's good looking.  I like that.  I like that.  You know, good looking.  Yeah.  That video's called, She's a Gobble Queen, if you're looking for her.  I'll just retweet these links. 
[00:41:30]  Fuck it.  Gobble Queen, young and sweet only.  What Cinderella song was playing in the background of that?  Hmm, not sure.  I was too busy looking at the beave.  Yeah, looking at that fucking hot chick.  She trims hair, I might have to go get my hair trimmed.  You know what the fuck I'm talking about?  Like, all he's got to do is sit in that chair and start rapping to her.  And the Gobble Queen will get to work.  Yeah, the Gobble Queen's going to go to town.  Hey, thanks for the haircut.  Can I also see you naked?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Just a little off the top of my cock.  Whoa.  And she'll be like, all right, you know I'm the Gobble Queen, right?  Right, right.  She goes, yeah.  Did you notice under this shirt is titties?  Yeah.  Titties.  Titties under the shirt.  You know, you're good looking.  I like that.  What an ass fuck.  I can't help but notice you're good looking.  That's kind of my thing.  I kind of like that in a girl.  Good lookingness.  Yeah.  You know what I hate? 
[00:42:30]  Girls that are bad looking.  Nah, that's a bad thing.  For me, that's bad.  For me.  That's my taste, though.  I want to see those tits.  Anyway, enough talking.  Why don't you start Gobbling Queen?  Yeah.  You're the Gobble Queen.  Hey, I bet you went backstage that night, didn't you?  Yeah.  I'm going to wheel those pants off you.  Who's this?  Sir Ian McKellen.  What?  Sir Ian McKellen?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, man.  He's out there with Jim.  She brought in my fucking...  He doesn't want to come and say hi? 
[00:43:00]  My Lord of the Rings poster.  You could.  Yo, Sir Ian.  Yo, Sir Ian.  He's already gone.  He's an old queen.  Really?  Yeah, he's very gay.  I did not know that.  What?  I would have commented.  Which one is he?  He's the Gobble Queen.  He's the Gobble Queen.  That guy.  Magneto.  Magneto.  Oh, God, yeah.  Fucking Gandalf.  Yeah.  Oh, God, he is Gandalf.  That's right.  Yeah.  He's been in some movies.  Fuck, yeah.  He likes guys naked like I like girls naked, though. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  More tits than we could count.  Oh, there's more tits than he could count.  Three girls.  You know what?  There was really three girls in there.  It's a safe bet.  You could just count heads and then double it, you know, barring any unpleasant news.  Unpleasantness.  It's terrible.  The guy next to him was just stuck in the room going, yeah, dude, whatever.  Okay.  Fine.  He's like, yeah, we got the best seats in the house, huh? 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Yeah.  You liked that, didn't you, Sam?  Yeah.  It was so fantastic.  It was so good.  And I also liked the idea of him recording that in, like, the 80s, and now it's coming  back to haunt you.  What a deacon and douchey.  Well, we've talked about this shit with Instagram and Twitter and YouTube channels and everything.  That fucking tape, I've been asking for that tape forever.  And Wheeze always goes, I just don't have a copy, I don't know where it is, all that shit.  So someone had that tape for 24 years in a box in an attic somewhere, finally decided, 
[00:44:30]  he was probably looking for someone, holy fuck, yeah, the same kid as the tape.  Yeah.  Got a hold of Wheeze, who finally tells me I found it.  He gives me a copy.  I mean, now it's all over the, technically all over the world.  Yeah.  And it was just buried for a long time.  And those guys were in the clear safe.  And the headline is, douchebag and dickhead raiding the chase that walked in.  Right.  You know what?  Also, back then, if you had a camcorder running and you were videoing something, you know, 
[00:45:00]  it was a big deal.  Yeah.  So you had to talk or something.  You just felt like you had to do something.  Now you just fucking video your lunch and post it so everyone could see it.  Right.  But you'd tape over everything then.  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't want to go buy new tapes.  You'd put the little piece of tape over the thing and you'd tape over every tape.  Yep.  Thank God that gold stayed.  Beaver.  Nice beaver.  Nice beaver.  You know what's under that shirt.  Right.  Tits. 
[00:45:30]  Tits.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, I knew that.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  I'd love to hang out with that guy.  I hate to say it.  I just, my memory is that he was a pretty cool dude.  He was a fucking man.  I swear to you, I can't, I would like to say that, no, he was always a dick, a dork or  a douche.  Did you hang with him?  Like, in bars and stuff?  Well...  Because I bet he was, like, scoping the chicks.  Yeah, he was.  I mean, like, because he was a sales guy and we were on air, the two didn't really kind 
[00:46:00]  of mingle or whatever.  Yeah.  We hung every once in a while at a gig and had beers, but I just always thought he was  all right.  I don't know.  He came across kind of...  I'd love to hear him pitch in sales meetings.  Like, he was probably fucking, like, the man.  He was the man.  He thought he was Gordon Gekko.  I'd love to know what he's doing, though.  Yeah, here's what we're gonna do.  We got a nice ad campaign.  Let me tell you something about the Wee Show.  Let me tell you something.  You're not advertising on this show?  Let me tell you.  You're not advertising.  Yeah.  If you're not advertising on this show, you're not advertising.  Yeah.  No one's hearing you. 
[00:46:30]  You wanna go across the street?  Be my guest.  Come back to us.  Prices will be higher.  By the way, you want any chicks?  You come to me.  Yeah.  I got the hookup on a lot of shit.  I'll hook you up.  What do you want?  Blow?  Chicks?  Yeah.  What do you want?  Girl?  Boy?  A little booger?  Sugar?  I'm down.  No, I'm down.  He can will the shirt off the broad.  Oh, yeah.  He's like a Jedi.  He's like a Jedi.  Trying that shit.  You like good-looking girls?  That's my thing.  I've got it into that.  Right.  You don't need to wear that shit. 
[00:47:00]  I don't need to wear this shirt.  Yeah.  That's it.  You're the Gobble Queen.  I'm the Gobble Queen.  The Gobble Queen.  I'm gonna hook you up with the styling after that.  A little hair styling.  Yeah, she does it.  The Gobble Queen.  Wait till you see the beaver on this chick.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Nice beaver.  Can I hear the first part again?  Please.  Please.  I think this should go viral.  I really do.  It's just so fucking douchey it should go viral. 
[00:47:30]  Just the first part where he calls her the Gobble Queen.  Believe me.  I could listen to the whole thing again.  Now we know them.  So now these are lines that we ignored at first.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because you guys weren't really sure where I was on with this.  I wasn't all in, of course.  I mean, it didn't take long, but...  It's two guys just looking through the glass.  It's probably where he's hanging with Sam Kinison back in 1989.  It's had horribly mediocre girls.  They're in, like, E-Rock's little production studio.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing their own little show.  With a video camera. 
[00:48:00]  There's another video camera in studio, and I got some of that footage, too.  Oh, wow.  That I'm going to upload soon.  Without this great director's commentary, though.  Oh, man.  Right.  Commentary.  And then maybe I'll just throw the whole thing up as one long fucking hour video.  Go ahead.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  She's going to show up.  Oh, thank you.  Pause.  I forgot about that.  That line's great, too.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Because fucking Rosie O'Donnell is showing her tit.  She's like a midget flatso.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[00:48:30]  She's like a fire hydrant with no titties.  That's a great name for...  That's a great Twitter name, midget flatso.  What a great name.  No titties.  That's what we were waiting for in here.  This is the original man cave.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's right.  All right, let's go.  Oh, here we go.  She's going to show up.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  That's the girl.  She faxed it in.  It's got her tattoo of her boyfriend.  Get her out of there.  Get her out of there.  I'll see.  I like that blonde right there, man.  She looks fucking... 
[00:49:00]  She looks like a fucking gobble queen.  Oh!  She looks like a gobble queen.  She's just an innocent girl.  It's in the studio one day.  She's the gobble queen.  Yeah.  There were girls that came in, and I got...  I got topless quads from 1989, too, but...  That is so bad.  I'm going to have to adjust that for YouTube.  Bad.  But she doesn't look like a gobble queen.  That was just something you say.  Not even close.  She looks like just a normal fucking girl that, you know, got excited because Sam Kinison was insane. 
[00:49:30]  He just wanted to say it.  Yeah, he's a gobble queen.  Oh, this guy's fucking outrageous.  This guy's nuts.  He didn't have real opinions on these girls.  One minute he's saying the girl, thank you for getting topless, and then say, oh, get her out of here.  Get her out of here.  Which way is the room going, guys?  Which way is the room going?  The man on the gobble queen.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, my boss is sitting there going, oh, show us your fit.  Oh, man.  She's going to untuck him.  I think the blonde is going to do it.  No.  You think so?  Yeah, she's just...  And she just watched her untuck her shit. 
[00:50:00]  And Sam's giving her the pressure.  Yeah.  Show us your fit.  In production.  They're laughing at us.  There's 30 guys in the studio.  They're laughing it up.  Show us your fit.  Show us.  There she's going to.  You can tell.  That shirt.  That shirt's got it.  Pause.  She's going to show him.  You can tell.  You can tell.  What in her body language says that she's going to lift her shirt up?  Trust me, fellas.  I've seen a lot of girls show a lot of tits in my life. 
[00:50:30]  It's a look they get in their eyes.  Yeah, he could just sense it.  He felt the energy shift.  It's a tit showing.  I'm like the titty whisperer.  You could tell she's just a nice girl that's just laughing it up a little bit.  No, bro.  That's what she wants you to think.  You trust me.  I see the subtleties in a woman's eyes when they're going to show their tits.  Go back.  Go back.  Then you had a youngster like Opie going, yeah, wow, he sees the subtleties.  Yeah, he's great.  I've got to hear the you could tell part.  Yeah.  Show us your tits.  Show us. 
[00:51:00]  There she's going to.  You can tell.  Bye, honey.  That shirt.  That shirt's got.  That shirt's got fucking titties.  Open soon.  That shirt's got titties.  Open soon.  Open soon.  He's trying to come up with like clever lines as he goes, but realizes there is no humor value to what he's saying.  I'm hating this guy more and more.  He should be on WDUD.  Titties open soon. 
[00:51:30]  Titties.  We didn't catch that one the first time.  Open this titty show.  Titties open soon.  What?  He's an idiot.  That shirt.  Titties open soon.  Nice bow tie.  I got a bow tie for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want you to put that bow tie around my dick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then with your titty.  She's wearing a cummer bun.  How about I cum in your butt? 
[00:52:00]  He's such a dude.  He'd say something like that.  That bun should have cumber all over it.  Oh, holy shit.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Come on.  Then you got that shit.  They got more tits in there than they can fucking count.  No, there's not.  She's good looking.  I like that.  Yeah.  Real sleazy looking for her.  Yeah.  She's sleazy. 
[00:52:30]  She's wearing a bow tie.  Right.  She's a nice enough person.  She's just standing there.  She looks all right if she put on like bar clothes or something.  But she doesn't look sleazy.  No, not at all.  She doesn't look like somebody you'd find like laid out in a dressing room.  And granted, you can only see half the room.  But I think she's the only girl you could see.  Yeah.  It's half of the room.  So what is he talking about?  There's more tits than you can count.  He's got her backstage sucking dick.  She could make me cum with her nipple ass. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Good one.  Good one.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks.  He's fucking hot.  Oh, my God.  I have a colo.  He's horrible.  Yeah, you could.  This guy could easily be listening to us.  Oh, I hope he is.  And he's like, holy shit, this tape was buried for 24 years.  What are you doing to me?  He could be listening to us because you can bet he's not broadcasting.  Tuxedo.  Yeah.  She should have worn her.  Sexedo.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Sexedo.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  It's a real sleazy look.  How about you tuck this in your seat and go, oh, something.  She got fully ramped up for this act.  Yeah.  No good.  Does she look fully ramped up to any of you?  No.  No, not at all.  She looks like a dumb fucking, a dumb catering hall waitress who just stopped in to hopefully  meet Sam.  Right.  That's it.  She has scoliosis.  Yeah.  Spine's all curved over and everything.  She should be lighting those little sterno things and putting them under fucking french 
[00:54:00]  fries.  That's my magician name.  Sterno the Magnificent.  He gives, on one of the videos, he gives Howard a little jab.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He goes, we all know how reasonable Howard is.  And he rolls his eyes to the camera back in 1989.  And then, of course, Joe Hoff, 23 on Twitter.  He just can't leave my pal alone.  He goes, all right, which one of these shitheads is Jim Chandler? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no.  Jim Chandler was college radio.  I didn't know when Jim Chandler had a professional radio station.  He's not in that room.  No, he's not in this room, you assholes.  You and Jim Chandler ever talk about girls like this, though?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I thought Jim Chandler was all about this.  Shirts that open.  This guy's like, has a little chip to him.  What's that?  A little chip.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This guy's great.  A little chip to him.  Oh, Chip loves him, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  He's saying some cool shit.  Take her out for drinks and then maybe what?  Maybe bone.  Right. 
[00:55:00]  He just runs out of steam.  So many tits in there, you can't count.  He ain't bullshitting.  He couldn't figure out what else to say after the shirt.  Just pull it like tits.  He has a lot of confidence and then it just peters out.  I love her, man, for sex.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to keep going again, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Especially on a train to Zilchville.  Right.  Wish he's going out for the night.  We get the best room in the fucking place right here.  We don't. 
[00:55:30]  We don't.  Yeah, because we don't get to talk to any of the girls.  Right, right.  We're not actually having contact with these girls.  Right.  I'm just fucking making shit up.  Right.  We got the best room in the place.  Fucking radio station.  No, you don't have the best fucking room in the place.  Best room in the place.  Is that kind of like having the best seats in the house?  Uh-huh.  We got the best room in the place.  We got the best room in the place.  Best.  I'm starting to think these guys think they're better than everyone else.  Oh, yeah.  That day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Look, honestly, I don't know who this wheeze guy is, but I mean, to say we shouldn't be on  the air is ridiculous.  Yeah, this is gold.  Come on, show us your hooters.  Hooters.  Hooters.  Hooters.  That's a fool.  He's in his head.  All right, I've said tits a whole bunch.  What can I say?  It's cool, but it's something different.  Well, he said titties.  Titties.  Hooters.  Hooters.  He thought someone was going to just watch this and be like, this guy is a fucking hoot. 
[00:56:30]  Where'd you say he works?  Sales?  That's insane.  This guy should be on air.  This was filmed for nobody.  Yeah.  It was just someone's private fucking camera that day.  We didn't even think to film it.  Yeah.  Wow, dummies.  There's no place to put it.  If you didn't have a TV deal, what are you going to do with it?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I guess.  There's a fucking place right here.  Sure do.  Sure do.  Come on, let me show us your hooters.  Hooters.  And I wouldn't let her get out of here.  I'd like to see this naked.  I want to see this woman naked. 
[00:57:00]  I'd like to get her naked.  Oh, I want to see this naked.  I want to see this naked.  This woman naked.  Naked.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  He is a fucking dolt.  He goes from funny to just angry.  Now I'm just mad at him.  Trying to be the cool guy in the room.  Yes.  Just a tool.  Like, he went home that day.  That's what's so infuriating, that he went home that day, he got in his car, and he was  like, I was just thinking, I'm the fucking man.  Yeah.  That's right, he's the man. 
[00:57:30]  Let's see this chick naked.  Wait till these gobble queens get a load of meat.  Yeah.  She's got a cumberbund on.  Why do you want to see her naked?  She's got a fucking catering hall employee.  She is, yeah.  I hope she's never been made to work.  I hope she had a fucking pole on the way to work.  Didn't make it in.  Yeah, I got a pole for her.  Yeah.  Yeah, how about that?  On my dick.  Right.  My dick pole.  My dick pole.  Fucking dumb bow tie she has.  Yeah.  Shirt pie smells like foot.  You ever smell a waitress shirt?  It fucking stinks like the kitchen. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  How about a fucking bow tie?  How about that's her blow tie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Blow tie.  Because she's a fucking...  Gobble queen.  Gobble queen.  She needs to wipe her mouth on that blow tie.  You might work...  Titties open soon.  Yeah.  Titties open.  I work in a catering hall, but I got dessert in this room, which is cum.  Right.  All right.  Let's continue.  Oh, please.  I love this.  I want to see this woman naked.  I bet they get her naked.  No, thanks. 
[00:58:30]  No, thanks.  Shannon.  Shannon.  Shannon.  Where do you work, Shannon?  You look like a wager.  I'll be down to get my fucking hair trimmed.  Oh, I'll be down.  I'll be down.  He has a hair metaphor.  Come on.  I'll be down.  Get my hair trimmed.  That's all you can think of.  Just trim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a better metaphor.  No, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he was thinking trim.  Trim.  Get a little trim.  What did she get?  Like, did she trim pubic hair?  Trimmed.  Yeah.  You know what I want?  It's all about the pussy and tits of this guy. 
[00:59:00]  I'll be down there.  I want a good-looking girl.  Who are the broads walking by?  I don't know.  Some famous people just walked by.  Ooh.  Yeah.  How are they going into the swag?  Who are they?  Mob housewives.  Oh, we did those broads already.  Do we got the big one?  Yeah.  I'll be down there.  The one that's got the spinoff?  Yeah.  She's hilarious.  The one with the tits all in her shirt.  Yeah.  Open soon.  I'll be down there.  Get myself maybe some shampoo and conditioner.  We blew it.  We could have had more tits than we could count in studio. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let them walk on by.  This good-looking girl, I'd like for her to trim my pubic hair in public.  I'm going to get down there for a trim.  Just anything she said, he was going to try to come up with something.  Yeah.  Oh, he's terrible.  I work at the pharmacy.  Oh, I'll go down there and fill a prescription.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fill her prescription.  He would have said something double entendre of it awful.  I need a prescription. 
[01:00:00]  You know what I mean?  I'll fill her pill bottle.  Hey, I got a cough drop for you.  Right.  Oh, damn.  Take orally.  Ah, there you go.  I've got an oral dosage.  No refill needed.  What?  A little more.  I love it.  I've got medicine in my syringe for you.  Did you say you have a needle dick?  No.  I hope there's more of these guys on the fucking video. 
[01:00:30]  I'll be down to get my fucking hair trying.  Ugh.  Show us your tits.  Show us your tits.  Now.  Now.  Now.  I will that fucking shirt off.  Oh, come on.  I don't want to see her.  She's got a new girl.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  Nice beaver.

I'm Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, you can get me on Twitter at NotSam,  but you probably already knew that, didn't you?  A lot of radio happened this week on the radio here on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[01:05:30]  Fez had a breakdown on Ron and Fez.  Jim Brewer was in studio.  We'll get to more Jim Brewer, Bill Burr on the phone, and a lot more.  But somehow, we get into the most random topics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Somehow, we started talking about Otabanga.  Otabanga is a black man who, I think he's from the Congo?  I think the Congo.  But in the early 1900s, he was on display in the zoo like an animal, 
[01:06:00]  in the monkey cage as an exhibit, as if he was less than human.  And people came from miles around to see him.  We got into his story.  And Jim said his name in a funny way, over and over and over again.  Why don't you take a listen?  Number five.  We were talking about zoos.  Yeah.  Look up Otabanga, O-T-A.  I just retweeted the story myself.  Otabanga was at the Bronx Zoo for a while as an exhibit. 
[01:06:30]  Really?  And this was common back in the very early 1900s.  In the day?  In the day.  Because they were trying to show, like, you know, human evolution.  Oh.  They kind of did away with the Otabangas.  Can you read up on Otabanga for everyone, Sam?  You've got the story in front of you.  Yeah, it was September 8, 1906.  Oh, it was Scarface.  Otabanga!  Otabanga! 
[01:07:00]  September 8, 1906 is when New Yorkers were treated to something novel at the Monkey House.  Oh, boy.  They even housed him in the Monkey House.  Monkey House?  Poor Otabanga.  It was a guy?  Huh?  Well, at first, some people weren't sure what it was.  Yeah, they weren't.  But he seemed much less a monkey than a man, though a very small, dark one with grotesquely  pointed teeth. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  He wore modern clothing but no shoes.  He was proficient with bow and arrow and entertained the crowd by shooting at a target.  He displayed skillet weaving with twine, made amusing faces, and drank soda.  Yeah.  Whoa.  The new resident of the Monkey House was indeed a man, a Congolese pygmy named Otabanga.  The next day, a sign was posted that gave Otabanga's height as 4 feet 11 inches, his weight at 103 pounds,  and his age at 23. 
[01:08:00]  The sign concluded exhibited each afternoon during September.  Oh.  Oh, that's nice.  So he was from the Congo.  Yeah, he was from the Congo.  So some of the slave owners there sold some of the last remaining slaves to exhibits and stuff.  Do you think the zoo filed his teeth down, or do you think the slave owners did it to try to sell him for more money to the zoo?  I'm not sure.  Whichever one of them did it, I'm sure they read the Constitution right before. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Thought good about it.  Great land we live in.  That reminds me of that Little Rascals episode, where they had that guy, and they thought it was, Spanky liked, thought it was his uncle.  Right.  And he was chasing him around the house, and he was a guy, he was some guy from a faraway land, and they were going to put him in a zoo.  And he was chasing him around, and that's when Spanky said, you don't eat me, my mama says I'm spoiled. 
[01:09:00]  Before the, uh.  And they got away with that on TV.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Huh?  Before the exhibit closed.  I'm going to go back to what Jimmy said in a little bit, because I really liked it.  The Constitution thing?  Yeah.  It closed very quickly.  Yeah.  But, uh, the second day that it was up, there was an even better show.  Otabanga and an orangutan frolicked together, hugging and wrestling and playing tricks on each other.  The crowd loved it.  Clint Eastwood later ripped that off for a movie idea.  Yes, he did.  Dirty Harry.  Dirty Harry.  Oh, Dirty Harry. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  To enhance the jungle effect, a parrot was put in the cage, and bones had been strewn about it.  Ah, like he, like, ate it.  Otabanga!  Back to Jimmy's point, are you saying that the Founding Fathers might have been a bit hypocritical?  Slightly.  And a bit full of shite?  Yeah.  But I guess things were different then.  They didn't realize that a human being should have equal value as another human being.  And I'm okay with that. 
[01:10:00]  I'm okay with what we were and what we are now.  Like, I just wish we would be truthful.  Like, meaning, stop pretending that we're built on this fucking amazing stuff.  Just admit, like, yeah, we fucking kicked the dog shit out of the Indians, took all their shit, and took a bunch of...  You know, if we said it honestly, I'd be totally cool with it.  That's world history, no matter where you go.  That's true.  Because it's like, I don't think there's one country where people, the indigenous people stayed there, built something up, and now they're a world power. 
[01:10:30]  This whole world and humanity is based on the fact that people explored and conquered and built and were eliminated and eliminated other people.  It's the way...  I don't know why the United States has to be so guilty about its past when it did nothing more or less than every other nation on the face of this earth.  I agree.  I don't think we should be guilty.  Oh, thank you.  No, I don't think we should be guilty.  I think you're right.  I don't think we should be guilty.  I just think that we should be honest with ourselves.  Fuck the rest of the world.  Because we're too busy telling the rest of the world how to live.  But there's always this... 
[01:11:00]  All you hear about is how horrible Americans were to the Indians, and how Columbus was a scumbag invader, and how we were horrible to slaves, and how this...  Like, all we hear is that.  What kind of honesty do we need if all we're hearing is how awful we were as a society?  It's not even that we were so awful.  Just admit the ugliness that we were built on.  I think it's been admitted ad nauseum.  It's been kind of admitted reluctantly.  I don't think there's one person that doesn't know the Founding Fathers, a few of them. 
[01:11:30]  We're slave owners.  And we're still going around telling everybody else how to behave humanely.  That's stupid.  That's what drives me nuts.  I can't stand that bullshit.  And there are probably a lot of people that don't realize only 100 years ago we had black people in the zoo as an exhibit.  Otabenga!  What do you mean?  Otabenga!  Otabenga!  For a green card, I've got to carve him up real nice.  Carve him up real nice.  And this was 1906.  It was not...  Is there more in Otabenga?  I'll find some Otabenga if you don't fucking have it. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, the exhibit didn't last long.  And this was the...  Why?  What happened?  It was too humane.  Too humane.  There was a black clergyman named Reverend James H. Gordon, who was also the superintendent...  Sharpton's great-great-grandpappy.  Mentor.  He was the superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn.  Right.  Yum, yum, eat them up.  And he...  That's what he was going to say. 
[01:12:30]  He made the point, our race, we think, is depressed enough without exhibiting one of us with the apes.  Wow!  Which even...  I mean, it's a great point.  He took a stand back in 1906.  That's pretty righteous.  He said, we think...  This was the cause du jour at the time.  Uh-huh.  We think we are worthy of being considered human beings with souls.  Oh, there you go.  Well, he's pushing for that.  How'd that work out for him?  Yeah, still working on it.  Am a person.  Wow.  I got more on Ota Benga from Wikipedia. 
[01:13:00]  Benga had been freed from African slave traders by the missionary Samuel Phillips Werner, a businessman recruiting Africans for the exposition.  He traveled with Werner to the United States.  At the Bronx Zoo, Benga had free run of the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's monkey house.  So he could go...  Come and go as he pleases.  Oh, okay.  He had to put in a shift at the monkey house.  Go grab a fucking grazed papaya.  Right.  You want it?  Yeah.  Except for a brief visit with Werner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in Virginia, for the rest of his life. 
[01:13:30]  For the rest of his short life.  Oh, wow.  He only made it to 33.  33.  That's pretty good.  That's too bad.  The mayor released Benga to the custody of Reverend James Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum.  Okay, that's what you were talking about.  That same year, Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth capped. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, he got caps?  Well, yeah.  They must get the shit out of people walking around like that.  So the young man could be more readily accepted in local society.  Benga was tutored in English and began to work.  When several years later, the outbreak of World War I stopped ship passenger travel and prevented his returning to Africa, he became depressed.  Aw.  Aw, shit.  Did he kill himself?  He sure did.  Did he?  Committed suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.  Olibenga! 
[01:14:30]  Olibenga!  That's not the name he said.  Oh, poor guy.  It is.  He was in Cuba.  I killed communists for fun.  For a green card, I got to carve him up real life.  Liberdade.  Liberdade.  Liberdade.  Olibenga!  Olibenga!  I missed this part.  Displays of non-Western humans as examples of earlier stages of human evolution were common in the early 20th century. 
[01:15:00]  There you go.  When racial theories were frequently intertwined with concepts from evolutionary biology.  Eh, it was all new.  You know, what are you going to do?  Eh, they didn't know any better.  Shouldn't put that guy in the zoo.  There was no internet.  Yeah.  There was no real other entertainment.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Who knew you shouldn't put that guy in the zoo next to the apes?  Yeah, we didn't know any better.  We colonized the place.  We come up with a constitution, a bill of rights for ourselves.  Who knew you shouldn't put that guy in the zoo next to the gorilla?  We were already building skyscrapers in 1904. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I love that.  I mean, they weren't, you know, massive, but they were considered skyscrapers.  We knew enough to know that we didn't like that shit.  That's why we left England.  Like, we knew enough to know that religious freedom was important and our freedoms were important.  It wasn't like we were just fucking drawing like a bunch of circles on cave walls and nobody knew.  Well, I'll be honest with you, it probably wasn't sanctioned by the U.S. government in 1900, this little show that they put on with Ota Benga.  Ota Benga.  Ota Benga. 
[01:16:00]  Ota Benga!  I'm sure it wasn't a sanctioned thing.  And, you know, when somebody had a legitimate gripe about it, they put an end to it.  When the man said...  Why wouldn't that occur to them before the man said it?  Yeah.  Oh, so we're looking for an ethical circus guy?  Google image Ota Benga.  I want to see if they have any pictures of him.  That's him.  No, I know that, but I want to see others where he's maybe in a cage or playing with the orangutan.  It's like Flip Wilson a little bit.  It did look like a young Flip Wilson. 
[01:16:30]  I think.  Ooh.  Let me see.  Those pointy teeth were...  That's scary.  Absolutely was scary.  Wow.  Damn.  I imagine they were filed painfully down.  Oh, my God.  Painfully.  You don't think they used, like, the latest...  A little sharpener, basically.  They didn't use the latest in fucking pain-relieving dentistry.  They did, yeah.  Yeah.  Hold your head still, you subhuman, while we fucking file your teeth down for entertainment. 
[01:17:00]  Lovely.  Oh, my God.  He looks happy there, right?  That's true.  He does.  Smiling.  Yeah.  Oh, people are saying that not Sam is Odubenga's great-great-grandchild.  Oh.  I did not know that.  I don't know that one.  I wish he'd suffer the same fate.  I'd love to see Sam tossed into a zoo and humiliated.  Tangled on by animals.  Wrestling with the orangutans.  Yeah.  Just a loincloth trying to carry up his cock.  A quark. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, they drag him around by his awful fucking hairdo.  They'd probably worship you, the orangutans.  Could you look up hot and taut Venus?  What is that?  Supposedly...  Why am I trusting a fucking listener?  Am I crazy?  No, not like that.  H-O-T-T-E-N-T-O-T is one word.  Yeah, come on, Sam.  Yeah, this is her.  Okay.  She was on display as well?  Oh.  She was exhibited as a freak show.  Who is that bitch? 
[01:18:00]  In 19th century Europe.  Yeah, the huge African ass is sometimes called the hot and taut Venus.  Yes.  It's basically that shelf that some women have.  You could Google hot and taut Venus in a lot of these...  Will it come up?  Yeah.  These shelf asses.  I've seen some of those online.  Yeah.  Little kids standing on one to see a parade.  There you go.  Hot and taut Venus. 
[01:18:30]  Was that her name when she was on display?  Yes.  And what was her deal?  And where was she on display?  Uh, in Europe, like in England and stuff like that.  And she had a big fat ass.  Yeah, but...  So people would come from miles around to look at it.  Just to see it.  Of course.  What's that about?  It's amazing.  Well, they probably didn't have a large population of people that looked like that, so they couldn't  really see it.  And no real strip clubs.  Maybe some burlesque shows, but it was a free, cheap thrill.  Sarah, Sarah Bertman, or Beertman. 
[01:19:00]  Bartman.  Bartman.  Bartman.  Her name's not really Sarah.  Her name's Bartman.  Bartman.  Crazy.  Bartman.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Then she went to France.  Yeah?  See?  She got to travel around because of that age.  Well, she sold.  Sold to a person in France.  Did she see London?  Sold or get to go?  Did she see France?  She first saw London, then she saw France.  Right.  How did she fit in her underpants?  But she got to see France. 
[01:19:30]  Yes.  I've never been to France.  Me neither.  Who cares she was sold to France?  She got to see France.  And then she may have died of smallpox.  Ah.  Pox on you and your family.  But it could have been syphilis, too.  Not quite sure.  Whore.  Jesus.  Wow.  History's fun.  There's all kinds of shit going on.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God. 
[01:20:00]  They buried her in Paris, I guess.  And they wanted her family in Africa, wanted her remains back.  And they were like, get the fuck out of here.  I said, no.  We are keeping it.  It is part of our culture.  Uh-huh.  Oh, this is good.  Yeah.  Her skeleton and body cast were displayed in the French Museum of Natural History.  After she died.  So she didn't even...  So dignified.  That's the enraged.  She didn't even get to be...  Her what?  Rest in peace. 
[01:20:30]  Her skeleton and body cast.  Yeah.  Really?  She entered the cast of her body so you could then see the big shelf-ass.  Oh, yeah.  Where she entertained visitors until her skull was stolen in 1827.  Oh, my God.  Just leave this thing alone.  Tragic.  Yeah.  Eventually, the skull was returned.  The restored skeleton and skull continued to arouse the interest of visitors until the  remains were moved to another museum when it was founded in 1937 and stayed there until 
[01:21:00]  the late 70s.  Wow.  1970s.  Now where is it?  Her body cast and skeleton stood side by side, face to face, blah, blah, blah.  Do they eventually make wind chimes with their skeletal remains?  This poor woman.  Trinkets.  Right.  Jesus.  The worst is yet to come.  More of the Opie and Anthony Worst of the Week countdown.

I just wanted you to know.  Here's a car question.  How does rust get in to destroy your engine's fuel system? 
[01:25:30]  It's caused by water, attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.  And with water, that means corrosion can begin at any time.  But you can protect your engine with the BG Ethanol Defender Service.  BG cleans, dries, and protects the entire fuel system.  And you can find this service at a shop near you at BGfindashop.com.  Remember these two letters.  BG.  You betcha it's me, Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony Show, after Opie and Anthony Live. 
[01:26:00]  And this is the Worst of the Week Countdown.  We'll get to a lot.  We'll get to a lot.  I know we've done a lot, but we still are going to get to a lot.  Fez having his breakdown.  Chris Angel's magic.  More from Jim Brewer.  Right now, we get to a Bill Burr phoner.  Bill Burr is, I mean, he's a global phenomenon at this point.  He's a comedian.  He's out in Amsterdam to perform right now.  He called into the show, and he talked about his trip to Italy.  He talked about the Sistine Chapel, although he didn't realize what the name of the chapel was. 
[01:26:30]  And a whole lot more Bill Burr and his travels here on The Countdown.  Bill Burr.  What's up, fellas?  Are you really in Amsterdam?  Yes, I am.  Last week, to get acclimated to the time over here, I blew all the money that I was going  to make over here, and I went to Italy, and I went to the Sistine Chapel that I thought, 
[01:27:00]  I swear to God, was the Sistine Chapel my whole fucking life.  The Sistine Chapel?  And I went there.  And I went there.  Dude, I got to tell you, this is going to probably be the most ignorant thing I've ever  said in my life.  Oh, no.  It sucked.  It sucked.  Well, first of all, here's the deal.  If you ever go to the Sistine Chapel, when you go in there, go during the winter, so  there's not a bunch of fat people from Ohio standing in front of you for three fucking  hours. 
[01:27:30]  You go in there, and you have an option.  You either go right, or you go left.  Go right.  If you go right, you go right into it, and you look up, and you see it.  If you go left, like I did, like an asshole, it takes you through the whole Vatican fucking  museum.  Oh, shit.  Every goddamn pot and pan they ever fucking used for, like, the last 600 fucking years.  And every other room you walk into, the ceiling is painted. 
[01:28:00]  So you're looking up, and you're like, is this it?  Is this the Sistine Chapel?  Keep going.  Dude, by the time I got to it, I so didn't even give a fuck.  And then you get there, and it's so small.  That picture where God's reaching out with his creepy index finger to touch the other  guy's finger in a really uncomfortable way.  Yeah.  Dude, you could cut that out and hang it over your fireplace, and it would look normal.  Wow.  It's not big? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, so everybody walks in there, and they kind of, you know, I can't say, well, people  were talking, looking at it, and that's the greatest part.  But you start talking, looking at it, and then the guards in the Vatican start shushing  you.  They're going, shh.  Come on.  Which, of course, you know, taps into every aspect of being a comedian where you want  to be like, I'll go fuck yourself.  In the Vatican.  Of course, because there's nothing special going on in there.  You're looking at, I guess, a special place.  But why are they shushing people?  Everyone's there just to observe and check it out. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  There's no sermons going on or anything.  Maybe read up on it.  I guess it discusses the beginning of life and everything.  But it's their version, which I don't buy into.  Right.  But the Coliseum was great.  But anyway.  Oh, the Coliseum was great.  You can't just blow that off.  Yeah, that's like.  What do you like about the Coliseum?  That's huge.  The Coliseum, you can see that all modern day stadiums are basically based off of that.  I'm not saying the Coliseum didn't steal something from the Greeks or some shit. 
[01:29:30]  I don't know what.  The oldest one standing.  Dude, you walk in, you feel like you're going to like the Meadowlands.  But like, like the fucking, I don't know, whenever the hell they built it.  That's like, yeah.  When I go to something, I don't get the headphones and listen to the recording.  I just want to walk through it at my own pace.  And I think that that's why I just enjoyed the Van Gogh thing, because I went in there  by myself.  I was in and out for 35 minutes. 
[01:30:00]  I have a whole new appreciation for the guy.  And you didn't.  Yeah, you didn't have to get bored.  I became a headphone guy when I go to these places.  Oh, you do?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Alcatraz turned me around.  I wore the headphones there.  I loved it.  You know what?  I got it.  Yeah, but that's Alcatraz, dude.  That's like a prison.  You're not looking at, like, this is a spoon Al Capone used when he had cereal.  Well, yeah.  It was a little monotonous.  You're right.  But I felt like I learned something that day. 
[01:30:30]  That's pretty good.  How many people would fit in the Coliseum?  It was 50,000 to 80,000.  Jesus Christ.  It was a real-sized thing, and they had all these different levels to it.  It was the same shit.  You had to keep the corporate seats down low.  You had a mezzanine level.  And then you had the farmers sitting way up top.  That's fucked up.  It was just, like, concession stands.  Wow.  That is so fucked up that it's, like, the same thing. 
[01:31:00]  It was ancient.  Those Romans.  Oh, yeah, totally.  And the guys down below, you know, were getting more ass than the people up top,  unless they had the gift of gab.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you allowed to, like, walk through the seats and stuff, or what do they limit you?  Well, the seats, I think, were initially made out of wood or something because they don't exist anymore.  Okay.  And, you know, it's basically you're walking through a ruin, but it's remarkably still intact. 
[01:31:30]  I'm not telling you, like, I've seen – I went to the Grand Canyon and didn't give a shit.  But just to put it into perspective, like, you get off the subway station, and you walk out, and it's, like, there it is.  Wow.  It doesn't even look real.  Wow.  I've seen so many pictures of it.  You're like, oh, my God.  That's the fucking Coliseum.  Wow.  And then that's basically the most intelligent thing that I can say about it.  I'm like, yeah, that's the fucking Coliseum.  Yeah, so I'd like to show that I'm somehow smarter for having seen it. 
[01:32:00]  I'm not, but it's definitely – and the food – the food is insane, and Italians are some of the best drivers I've ever seen in my life.  They're fucking – they're aggressive the way Bostonians and New Yorkers are, but it's to a whole other level where they're on, like, scooters.  Like, on the other side of the double line, going around cars in, like, a group of six in single file.  Yeah.  And you'll be in the cab on the other side going, oh, my God, we're going to hit that guy. 
[01:32:30]  We're going to hit that guy.  And the cab driver never slows down, and neither does the guy in the scooter.  Wow.  It's like that game Centipede, and they just fucking all – just move slightly over.  He drifts over, and they just keep going.  They're fucking maniacs.  And they add, like, three guys on a moped.  Did you see that, where they just pile them on?  No, that's more like Thailand.  Vietnam.  Well, honestly, I saw that when I went to Athens.  They piled them on their scooters, but whatever. 
[01:33:00]  How did you figure out the subway in Italy?  Oh, dude, that was frustrating as hell because, you know, you had to make a change.  And when you're in Rome, it's like being in New York, so they just have that sense of just because I'm here,  therefore I'm successful sort of attitude.  So if you ask them, they'll say it one time, and then you go, wait a minute, blah, blah,  and they'll just kind of, like, drift away.  But I've done that.  Right.  I didn't get mad at that.  But if you go to the information booth, the people in the information booth, unlike New York, 
[01:33:30]  they're fucking sweethearts.  Oh, yeah.  They smile on the face, speak perfect English, and they let you know.  Wow.  We were staying over near the Vatican, which is really creepy.  It's like it's its own country.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a sovereign state within it.  It's got this giant fucking wall.  And I don't know.  I was making a lot of jokes when I was in there that I was making Nia.  She was laughing and also telling me to shut up because we were going through the Vatican fucking museum. 
[01:34:00]  I was, like, 800 yards in front of her.  Just trying to get through it, right?  Who cares?  And when we got out of it, she goes, so what did you think?  I go, it's great.  I go, they had everything in there but the lie, rape, and murder.  They didn't have the room where some little boy was getting bent out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bill, you're a rock star.  You took that with them. 
[01:34:30]  They have, I don't know, but it was really cool.  Like, you could go over and, like, the Pope gives mass and he could just show up.  Wow.  I really respected that just as far as trying to sell tickets.  Like, you come out there, the guy, he's killing it.  Like, he's just fucking, like, like, Kevin Hart, Dane Cook, and all those guys combined.  He's got tickets.  He's just like fucking.  Pope's going over big.  Yeah, the Pope goes over big over there.  Right.  Wow.  We could have walked over to it and me and Nia wake up and she's just, I was like, do you 
[01:35:00]  really want to go over this?  And we were both jet lagged.  And I'm like, I don't even believe in this shit.  Like, but then I, you know, I actually said, so I go, this is like the greatest, this would  be a great Opie and Anthony stunt.  Not to get you guys in trouble.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  There's really nothing stopping you from going there and just heckling.  Heckle the Pope.  Other than the only thing that made me nervous was I was no longer in Italy.  So if I get grabbed by a Vatican guard, like, where are they going to take me? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, that's literally a dungeon.  Yeah, they have a dungeon.  Yeah, they're going to take me back and out, back into Italy.  Or am I going to go into the, you've been a naughty boy room?  Yeah.  It's like a sovereign nation, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have their own rules, man.  San Marino, Liechtenstein, and like fucking Singapore.  There's a few of those.  And of course me, I go on the internet and I try to look up conspiracy.  Like that's where the Illuminati lives.  So yeah.  Like Liechtenstein literally is like a country of, I think that's how you say it, like, like 
[01:36:00]  3,500 people.  And they, so with, with all rules of history, they should have been overrun by a pack of  fucking Huns a long time ago.  It's like, how do these guys, how do they defend their country?  Yeah.  Unless they do something with the banks or something that keeps everybody out, like, there  might be a reason that nobody fucks with them.  Maybe they serve some kind of a need.  They have the Ark of the Covenant or something.  Yeah, I would say that they're, uh, they're pretty much running shit.  Yeah, I think they, they're doing something. 
[01:36:30]  They got God on their side.  Yeah.  The fear of God.  I don't know.  Well, yeah, if you're going back to the, uh, the Vatican, yeah.  Yeah.  I have, I don't have no idea.  But whatever, it's been, uh, it's been a good tour so far.  Wait, wait.  I wanted to hear about the Van Gogh Museum.  So that's, that was cool, huh?  Yeah.  You know what I loved?  I immediately loved the guy because one of the first paintings I looked at, he was in this  class and he had to draw like a skull, like the skeleton.  So he drew, he drew it in an amazing way.  And then in the end, he put a cigarette in its mouth as like a fuck you to the teacher. 
[01:37:00]  So immediately I liked the guy.  I'm like, all right, I like this guy.  I never saw that one.  And you're in Amsterdam performing?  I did a show, uh, here last night.  It was great.  I was going to ask you, so they, they completely understand, uh, your comedy and all that?  But yeah, Europe is like a mind fuck when you get over here, because if you, if you think  too much, I'm in Amsterdam, it's going to put you on your heels.  You just, I just act like I'm in the States and you know, once every 10 minutes, I'll say 
[01:37:30]  something that falls flat and they don't get it.  And then I just make fun of the fact that I didn't do any research about what they knew  or what they didn't know.  And then they laugh and then you keep going.  But like Ari Shafir's out here, uh, next week.  Um, you know, obviously the, the further in Eastern Europe you go, it's, it starts to  get a little more difficult.  Like I got one in Finland coming up and I remember last time it was, uh, it wasn't like they, 
[01:38:00]  they, they, they didn't get it, but like they, it was more like, it was very like, uh,  like it's sometimes if you do a college gig, you think you're bombing, but you find out  later, you're just at a really smart school and they're more like cerebral, right?  They don't laugh the way morons like, like myself would laugh.  So you kind of get like a sense that you're bombing, but you're not.  But the one I'm, I'm kind of nervous about it is I'm ending up in Iceland and I did an  interview with them and their language when they did the intro, they literally sounded 
[01:38:30]  like, like the new Sabbath album when they run like Aussie's fucking, whatever he's saying  backwards.  Oh wow.  Thank you for calling.  Let me do the, uh, the intro and then we do interview and I'm like, okay.  And then I just hear, but how, how does it feel to have fans in Amsterdam?  That's gotta be cool.  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  Well, I mean, it's, yes, it's, it's, it's gotta be my, I mean, that's gotta just blow  your mind.  Yeah, no, it does.  It does.  Every time, uh, you come, but you guys, the thing about it is you don't understand is  you guys have fans over here too.  It's the, the, the amazing thing about the internet.  Right.  Crazy.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Bill, I saw it.  Anyway, the reason why I called up was, uh, you guys know, I don't know that any of the  fans have gotten wind yet.  Like we're doing the second annual, uh, Patrice O'Neal, um, comedy benefit for, uh, for his  family and victims, um, of strokes, stroke survivors and that type of thing. 
[01:39:30]  Once again, it's going to be at the city center.  It's been, as always, I'm hoping, um, but you know, Opie and Anthony, you guys will do  the intro like you did last year and we can kick it off.  And, um, yeah, fuck yeah.  That'll be great.  Do we have anybody else on it?  I mean, obviously you're on it.  I'm on it.  Who else do we have on it?  Do you know?  Oh, it's going to be great.  It's you, me, Colin, Nick DiPaolo, uh, Dane Cook, Bobby Kelly, talent.  Uh, I don't know if you guys know him.  Yeah, I know talent, sure. 
[01:40:00]  Um, yeah, he used to do, uh, the Sunday nights at the Boston, the Uptown show.  He's one of the funniest, naturally funniest people I ever met.  You did morning radio for BLS or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a long time.  Uh, who else?  Who else?  I know we got a couple other big guns there.  You know what?  I'll have all the names.  I'll have all the names by, uh.  You just, you just named enough people to sell this thing out.  That's, that's awesome.  For more of the O.P. and Anthony Wars to the week.

[01:44:30]  No!  Continues.  Heading towards the top of the countdown.  My name is Sam Roberts.  You know me from the Opie and Anthony Show and after Opie and Anthony Live,  you may also know me from the Sam Roberts Show,  which airs Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern here on this channel.  Great interviews.  Great topics.  It'll be a great time.  More of me.  How could it be bad?  Chris Angel.  We'll get to Jim Brewer.  I told you there'll be more Jim Brewer.  There will be in Fez's breakdown, of course.  But we've been obsessed with Chris Angel lately and his terrible magic show. 
[01:45:00]  He's got this series on television called Believe,  and he just does the worst tricks.  They're so obvious.  We figure them out.  We figure them out every time.  Because usually they're just camera tricks.  It's like figuring out Jurassic Park.  Oh, it's magic.  How'd they get those dinosaurs to come to life?  They use computers.  They just edited it.  It wasn't that tough.  It wasn't like real anything.  This time, Chris Angel made an elephant disappear,  and it didn't take us long to realize it wasn't quite as mystifying as he thought it may be. 
[01:45:30]  It's more Chris Angel here on The Countdown.  And the elephants, how did he do the elephant thing?  I don't know.  Well, I'm just thinking that they had the ring of people around the elephants.  They pull up the curtains around the elephants.  Can you show me that, Sam?  And then they say, drop the curtains and the elephants are gone.  I'm sure there's just a camera cut somewhere.  Right, like he cuts the camera.  Cuts the camera.  Gets rid of the elephants. 
[01:46:00]  I want to see the quick setup and then the reveal.  It's outside.  Maybe you can see where the shadows are.  Yeah.  Maybe we can figure out how long it actually shows.  Follow the shadows.  That's where Copperfield blew it for me at his Vegas show.  I've just got one question.  Are you ready?  What is he doing here?  What is he doing here?  It's going to make the elephants disappear.  Elephants on a football field.  They're surrounded by drapes.  Oh, I thought he was in a safari.  Oh.  He can't even do that.  They don't have a travel budget.  No.  I'm going to ask for the human chain to kind of... 
[01:46:30]  That's great.  These abused, beaten animals.  Poor things.  The shadows are definitely going with the...  The elephants could already be gone.  The yard line.  Yeah.  Like, he puts up three walls.  Oh.  There they are.  The curtains are three sides.  All right.  Man.  All right. 
[01:47:00]  So now the fourth curtain goes up.  The fourth curtain goes up.  Right.  And the people make a chain on three out of the four sides.  No.  They're all around, aren't they?  No.  No.  None of these shots are steady shots.  No.  They all have breaks in them.  Right.  Right.  Any one of these, they just simply put the wall down and have the elephants walk away.  Of course.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I'm going to give you a peanut.  Here you go.  There's a peanut.  Here you go.  Are you ready? 
[01:47:30]  I'm fucking ready.  Yeah.  Someone dug a hook into the elephant's fucking nose and pulled it out.  One, two, three, drop the crown.  Drop the crown.  Drop the crown.  Drop the crown.  The elephants are gone.  They just walked away.  All right.  So it's obvious what's going on here.  They got the crowd on only one side.  So the people making the chain are obviously in on it. 
[01:48:00]  And then the elephants go out the back.  Right.  Or they're just splicing this applause from something else.  Right.  Yes.  No, because they try to use the real people to, you know, they would have seen the elephants  to sell the illusion.  Not if you know it.  You could take them straight back out and they're not going to see them at all.  Look how it's set up.  You saw the YouTube video, too, where he was fucking up his tricks.  And they said the louder you cheer, the more likely you are to be on television.  Right.  Here's what I've heard they do.  The people in the human chain are in on it. 
[01:48:30]  That's obvious.  Yeah, yeah.  They're in on it.  The audience could see the elephants and they put up the final, what do they call it?  The fourth wall.  The fourth wall.  Yeah.  And as they put up the final wall that's right in front of the people that they want to trick,  they drop the back wall and the elephants just walk straight out of the fucking stadium.  I don't believe that.  I don't believe that.  It was a man of magic.  They were all cuffed.  That's all.  And they do things where the audience sometimes sees how phony it is.  They, they, but they're applauding for like the preliminary act. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  Like he'll do some kind of amazing thing to get the reaction shot.  My problem is if you're in on, you know, this audience shot, right away I'm like, oh, we're  only allowed to stay here.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is ridiculous.  And everyone's trying to figure out magic tricks these days.  So you gotta, you gotta trick them better.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But as soon as you know, you can only stay in one area, you know exactly how the trick  is done.  Exactly.  There is no trick here.  You're just like, okay, stop the camera. 
[01:49:30]  Stop the camera.  That's what I think.  I don't know.  I think they just walked them out the back.  Let's see where they could have walked the elephants.  They could have walked them out the back easily.  Let me see.  It's a big open stadium.  Go to the setup shot again.  Cause I want to see what's behind.  Okay.  They're right there.  See, they can walk right out.  There's no, there's nothing stopping them from just walking all the way to the, uh, the goal line.  Yeah, but what you'd, somebody would see them.  Yeah.  You'd see them on one or somebody, how tight they even, the crowd is on one side and they're  squished even together. 
[01:50:00]  It can be done, but I want to see where they're going.  Yeah.  They can make noise.  The other might have noise walking out.  Instead of having the people 10 to 12 deep.  Why?  When they spread them all the way out to the sidelines, they don't want them near the  sidelines, obviously.  Plus they would have to.  Why wouldn't you give them better, a better vantage point?  They have to leave.  Unless you don't want them in that area.  They have to leave the curtains up for like 15 minutes.  Well, that's the thing.  See, that's where the edit is for the TV show.  Just cutting all that time.  Yeah.  So there, he must be fucking around, blah, blah, blah, giving the elephants time to do 
[01:50:30]  it.  And then they do it in post the, uh, the quick edit.  Where do they go to the left or the right?  Once they go straight out, man.  Where though?  Where after the end zone?  There's trees there.  It just keeps going.  Oh my God.  There's no seats.  A mile away.  But that's the trick.  He probably takes his damn time, you know, yapping with the crowd, joking with them and stuff.  I don't know about that.  I'm telling you, dude.  I think it's just pure camera.  Yeah.  I do too.  I think it's an edit to take.  It probably takes five minutes to get them out of there and they probably, you know, 
[01:51:00]  chop it down in the edit to a quick, you know, 30 seconds.  But somebody, here's my thing.  Those drapes are not high enough to conceal all the way back.  Like the drapes, if that was 20 feet.  The people low to the ground, you're not going to see over the drapes ever.  I still don't think you can conceal that far back.  The giveaway is the people aren't all the way to the sidelines.  He's forcing them to be 10, 12 back.  Right.  So he doesn't want them on the sidelines, obviously.  Because then you would see them in the distance. 
[01:51:30]  Where do they go, though?  Let's say the elephants go straight back.  They go straight back, obviously.  There's a scoreboard, I think.  It's probably something right under the scoreboard is where is the out.  There's just a truck there and they get into the truck and drive away.  Maybe.  Behind those trees.  Look at the sideline.  That's the giveaway.  Why doesn't he want them by the sideline?  I see here what you're saying here.  Did they stop at midfield?  Maybe they turn them to the right.  Huh?  Maybe they go out and then turn them around that corner.  But people would see them. 
[01:52:00]  But somebody would...  No, that's...  I think the risk of being seen is too big.  No, he already figured that out by not having them all the way to the sidelines.  I'm going to obsessively say that over and over again.  Because look at the vantage point for most of these people.  They have five, six, seven, eight people in front of them.  Right?  They're playing again to show the crowd.  Because all those people would not be in on it.  The people that are making the human chain have to be in on it.  See, those people, you've got to know, are in on it. 
[01:52:30]  The human chain.  So let's blow them off.  But you can't have the whole stadium in on it.  Those are all his friends, family members of his staff.  Do you see how narrow...  Look how narrow the viewing area is.  And he forces people to be way the fuck back.  Look. 
[01:53:00]  He set that up purposely.  Go back one second, Tim.  Watch.  This is why I'm not sure about that.  Because when you go here...  If there was something right behind him, I would...  But go right to where they show that back angle.  Where can they go?  They just walk straight back.  They take their fucking time.  And then in post, he cuts down what probably was a 10-minute bullshit session with him.  There's a fence back there.  And make it quick.  Right?  Yeah, that is a fence behind the trees.  What happens is you go back there...  You can't really see if there's an exit at the fence or anything. 
[01:53:30]  You can't see.  They'd have to turn to the right, but they may turn to the right.  All right, maybe they do.  You know, there's a reason why he doesn't have them all the way out to the side.  Right.  Period.  You can see how much longer the shadows are.  If you had to wait that long, the shadows would have been...  I mean, how long does it take elephants to go?  It looks like 40 yards, maybe.  But, you know, that could be less than five minutes, really.  That's a couple minutes.  It's crazy.  And then he just edits that down in post.  What a cut shot.  I don't know. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, I think camera...  I think his camera's the simplest solution.  Yeah.  It's the ease...  Like, he does something to get them crazy, and I think...  We're going to have to agree to disagree on this one, gentlemen.  I think it's...  They're not selling me on that.  I think he would have...  Because I think he needs some people not in on it.  Oh, I don't think that the audience is in on it.  Right.  I agree with you.  I think they're not in on it, but I think they're cheering for something else, and he's  just splicing that together like they're cheering for the amazing trick.  Because I don't see how you would...  What's the watch?  You walk...  You walk him straight back, and then, you know, the exit I'm not really sure of, but... 
[01:54:30]  Already?  Yeah.  He even makes the shot of the audience tight like they could be all the way to the sidelines.  Raise it up.  Raise it up.  Kristen!  Wave to me, Kristen!  Are you up there?  Wave!  Mm-hmm.  So there's the cut.  Yeah, they keep cutting.  And that's the cut, because they need to cut down the time of the illusion. 
[01:55:00]  And look, they're only tightly in the center of the field.  Two, three, drop the curtain!  Drop the curtain!  Drop the curtain!  Drop the curtain!  You can't even drop the curtain, Rice.  Oh, it's straight back.  Period.  See, look.  Why would you have people 20 deep when they could be on the sidelines?  Especially if it doesn't matter if you're going to do a cut shot. 
[01:55:30]  Let me say hi to Jessica in New Jersey.  Jessica.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi, Jessica.  What's up?  So, the Mass Magician did a thing on this trick where, like, they show you how he does it.  Right.  You can find a clip online.  It's basically, like, there's a fake scenery that they put the elephant behind, so you can't see him with the camera angle.  A fake what?  Fake scenery.  A fake scenery.  Yeah, so he doesn't really go that far away.  He's, like, maybe 30 feet away, you know?  And he's hiding behind what looks like big trees. 
[01:56:00]  This is an outdoor thing in a football stadium.  Unless there's just no camera motion.  A fake fucking scoreboard or something.  Like, it's just fake.  All right, here's Magic Revealed, and it looks very similar to...  Let's do the exact same trick.  Okay.  All right, let's see.  All right.  ...with the Magician, seeing exactly what the witnesses...  Wow.  ...nothing unusual here.  No.  ...other than a man in a red shirt and a scary black mask.  Wow.  We've now walked to the other side of the sheet.  Is this the Chris Angel trick?  There's nothing...  I mean, it looks like...  Or is this that trick in general, or is he specifically addressing Chris Angel? 
[01:56:30]  No, I don't think he's...  No, I mean, the Chris Angel trick...  No, that's the problem with Chris Angel.  He does a lot of tricks that have been done a million fucking times, too.  That's how you know he's a hack, like...  He's trying to put his own little spin on it.  But there is his...  He's not even doing his own spin.  The curtains even look the same.  Exactly.  The Ask Magician has already shown how to do this trick.  That's why Penn and Teller are brilliant.  Yeah.  Because they spend ridiculous amounts of time coming up with new illusions...  They actually create.  ...and they're not satisfied until it's done perfectly.  Illusions.  And then they finally bring it to the public. 
[01:57:00]  Penn has said many times on a show, some of these things they do, it takes years...  Yeah.  ...for them to figure it out right.  Let's see what this guy is up to.  The Magician commands his assistants to bring in the sides of the sheet, forming a large, three-sided box.  Now to close it up.  He commands the smaller sheet to be raised to form the front of the box.  Okay.  Not much of a trick, but there it is.  A big, fabric box in the middle of a parking lot.  Yeah, a trick.  Maybe he's not done. 
[01:57:30]  He tells his assistants to hang on firmly to the large sheets as they battle the wind.  This is the high cost of doing a trick outside.  That's exactly what...  One final command for the TV audience to keep our eyes on the box, and the Magician prepares to reveal the results of his conjuring.  Oh, my God.  Let's watch.  What do you know?  A five-ton elephant.  Oh, it's the reverse.  Yeah, he makes it appear.  Where did he come from?  He was definitely not on the witness list. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know.  The girls are impressed.  Maybe the masked magician can do real magic after all.  It's the exact same trick.  Yeah.  Except Chris Angel's trying to reverse it.  So how does the magician make the elephant appear from nowhere?  I see how you're doing.  In the middle of the lot.  They cut a hole in the parking lot, and they lower it, and then they raise the elephant,  and then they quickly have a truck come in and seal it up.  And re-pave it.  The fucking thing walks from the back.  That's obvious.  Let's see what he says. 
[01:58:30]  And that's what Chris Angel did.  Encircled by spectators.  Is that tree fake back there?  It sounds impossible.  It is.  Here are the secrets.  Oh.  First off, let's start with a group of spectators.  The secret here is...  They're in on us.  They're all in on the tree.  All right, so, so far, I'm right.  The magician has no trouble positioning them in a circle since they've been rehearsed.  Right.  This 360-degree walk is designed to convince us that the parking lot is empty and free of wandering elephants.  There you go.  Next, the large sheet is raised. 
[01:59:00]  Again, we can see the surrounding parking lot appears empty,  but appearances are deceiving.  We know he had to be hiding somewhere in this vast, seemingly empty lot.  But where?  We've been looking at his hiding place the entire time.  What?  Don't you remember seeing it?  You did.  What?  Constructed near a group of trees by the edge of the lot is a painted Hollywood backdrop and some fake trees. 
[01:59:30]  Holy...  This is the elephant's hiding place.  Huh.  Sound far-fetched?  It's true.  And chances are, it fooled you.  Even though this looks like a setup that a cartoon roadrunner might use to trick a wily coyote,  it's actually an effective hiding place for the elephant and his trainer.  No one would ever expect a real pachyderm could be stashed away behind some phony trees in the middle of a parking lot,  completely undetected.  Well, in the middle of a football field.  Right.  But the farther away the camera travels, the more deceptive the phony setup looks. 
[02:00:00]  Ah, there you go.  See it now?  When you know it's there, it's much easier to spot.  Yes.  The trick is that you didn't see it the first time because you didn't know where to look.  Wow.  This continuous camera angle from the illusion is low and only shows the front side of the sheet.  The trick only works from this perspective because as the sheet is raised,  the elephant begins to approach from the rear. 
[02:00:30]  So the angel just walked the elephants out the back.  Right.  We should watch it again.  And the key here is that it takes some time.  So that's where you guys are right with the fucking edit.  To knock down the time from whatever would take two minutes to get the elephants out.  I think Obi's absolutely right.  Maybe there's a fake thing put in.  I'm sure there is.  Well, a fake thing.  There was no way he was walking them that far.  But this makes sense.  I think he can also just walk them that far and just get rid of it in the edit. 
[02:01:00]  Let's see now that we know to look for it.  Let's see if we could find the secret hiding place for four elephants.  Oh, there it is.  That fat woman's vagina.  No way.  Oh, sorry.  Are you ready?  It's going to be hard to see the fake area, though, on TV like this.  Yeah.  She could blend it in.  It's probably the scoreboard.  And there's people. 
[02:01:30]  It probably is the scoreboard.  It's something to do with that scoreboard area.  Do we know what field that is?  No.  Not off head.  I think it's like a high school problem.  But all it has to be is the trees.  Right.  Yeah.  Giving the illusion that the trees are way far.  Wait a minute.  Maybe it's the scoreboard.  It could be.  Wait.  It looks like there's a scoreboard in front of the scoreboard.  It could be.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  That is something.  It looks like there's something in front of the actual scoreboard looking like another 
[02:02:00]  scoreboard.  Like between the goalposts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait.  Hold on.  Missouri State.  That's Missouri State.  So let's take a real look at the real Missouri State field and see if that's.  Look at us trying to debunk this.  Yeah.  Something fake.  It was obvious.  It was obvious that he walked the elephants out the back.  So obvious.  Yeah.  I mean, he had to.  Be real.  Because, I mean, the people in the human chain, yes, you got it. 
[02:02:30]  They're in on it, obviously.  But you can't have the whole crowd in on it because you do want some fucking dummies  in their reactions.  Is that the scoreboard right there?  Okay.  So this is where he was in the middle of the field.  There look to be more trees.  Yeah.  There are definitely more trees.  More trees.  Yeah.  There's no real trees.  Wait a minute.  It goes right to a park a lot.  It goes right to.  It looks like from the other angle.  It might be a scoreboard on the other angle.  Because the other side has the trees.  Yeah.  Try to get the full field.  Maybe that whole fence area was fake.  To the left of the scoreboard, there were more trees. 
[02:03:00]  A lot of trees.  That goes right to a lot.  The parking lot was definitely on this side.  Unless there's parking lots on both sides.  Check the other side and just see.  See if you got a better shot of the stadium.  Yeah.  Come on, Sam.  You're not finding it.  Why?  You think there'd be two scoreboards?  Oh, yeah.  There is probably.  Oh, look.  It has to be.  I don't know.  There's no real trees.  Look.  We were at the...  There's no trees on either side, really.  There's some.  It's not the part...  We were just looking at the parking lot side.  Right.  So the other side has even less trees.  So this is... 
[02:03:30]  We were just looking at...  Yeah.  This is 100% the same area.  Now, let's see...  And there's no trees.  Look.  There was all trees back here.  Come on.  So the scoreboard isn't fake, but the trees right behind the scoreboard are fake.  Look at this.  Look.  It's all trees.  Come on.  What is that?  Chris Angel's so fake.  There's an elephant behind those trees.  Come on.  Nice.  Now, let's see.  I want to see if you can pick it up.  So they did walk quite a way. 
[02:04:00]  They probably did, yeah.  But they had a lot of elephants.  So, I mean...  But Chris Angel's really good at distracting the crowd.  It fools around with them a little bit.  And they hid them behind all those fake trees, which are a lot closer than they appear.  And the whole thing was...  No, they're not...  No, because you could see the end zone or the track that goes around the stadium.  That's pretty obvious.  Yeah, they're at least behind that.  So they're at least behind that.  So I really believe they had to walk them a real long way.  Big elephant footprints.  See, they had to walk them all the way to...  Yeah, that's similar.  There's no trees at all on this one side. 
[02:04:30]  There's absolutely no fucking tree.  Find me the other angle on the other side, too.  So the trick goes like this.  It took a while to get the elephants out the back.  Chris Angel babbles for a while with the crowd.  And then in post, they go to that cut.  And then that's...  To chop down the actual time it took.  Where he asked that guy, like,  Oh, you've got to hold on because the wind is blowing it or something.  Right, right.  He did say something to one of the...  Right, so that was the distraction for the people.  And that probably went a lot longer than they showed on TV.  And I think he'd get the elephants out within two minutes. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Probably within a minute, to be honest with you.  A little over a minute, maybe.  But for TV, that's a long time.  That's pretty funny.  You can take ten minutes.  He can distract them out for ten minutes.  That's what I'm saying.  You take them...  Yeah, because he could fool around with other shit.  Because they're like,  Okay, the elephants are obviously in there.  We see the human chain.  So they're not...  Swallowing a sword.  Yeah, they're not sitting there going,  Why is this taking so fucking long?  They don't care.  If you can entertain them during that time.  Oh, that Criss Angel.  What a piece of shit. 
[02:05:30]  But this is...  I've got to say it again.  I know we say the same shit over and over again at times on this show.  But this is where he's a lazy fuck with his illusions.  Yeah.  Look how easy it was for us to just Google image the stadium  and see how the stadium is actually.  And also just do a YouTube search for the magician...  All right.  ...magician reveal...  Right.  Reveals it.  But as Criss Angel, that's your business?  When you do that and go,  Okay, fuck.  So people know how this trick's done.  So now I've got to do it in a way where it tricks them  and where they go, 
[02:06:00]  Wait a minute.  That's not how I saw it done.  Or I've got to stop worrying about looking pretty  and actually think of a new trick.  Right.  Or I've got to find a stadium that people can't look up online.  Right.  Because there's no trees at this fucking stadium.  No.  Google it.  Not like that, anyway.

[02:11:00]  Yes, yes, almost to the top.  I'm Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live as we near the top of the worst of the week countdown.  Of course, Fez's breakdown is still to come.  But we heard a little bit from Jim Brewer earlier on.  If you missed any of the countdown, you can listen on demand at SiriusXM.com or one of the many replays here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  But Jim Brewer, as I said earlier, one of the great storytellers that comes on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This guy got to take his family on a safari with James Hetfield from Metallica and the Hetfield family. 
[02:11:30]  Ridiculous.  They went on a safari in Africa.  They slept in tents.  It was the most insane concept I'd ever heard.  Can you imagine going on an African safari with your heavy metal hero?  I can't.  But Jim Brewer paints a very convincing picture.  He makes it a lot easier for all of us.  It's Jim Brewer and his heavy metal safari story.  I don't know.  I can't do it as well as Jim can.  So listen to him here on the countdown. 
[02:12:00]  So just before break, you were sitting down.  What were we going to discuss?  We were talking about, I think we were going into Africa.  Oh, all right.  You were done with the daughter?  Is that where we were going?  Well, it's part of the daughter thing.  Oh, okay, okay.  It's part of the daughter thing.  Yeah, you went to Africa with, well, James Hetfield.  I mean, it's out there.  We were on Instagram and all that.  How great is that?  And that's when I knew I was safe. 
[02:12:30]  Because I was very nervous about going into a safari.  Because we're staying in tents.  We're staying literally in tents.  Yeah, in the middle of nowhere.  Wow, that's cool.  It was cool.  Were you scared?  I was real scared.  Yeah.  And you had your whole family?  Yeah.  That's why.  Oh, man.  I would Google every night, you know, people mauled by lions.  You're just prey at that point.  Who's been mauled by safaris?  Is there revolutions?  There's more food out there. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  Is there a lot of people getting mauled?  I didn't find any.  So my first question, you're in tents in the bush, basically.  Yes.  So how do they protect you?  Well, this is what they say.  They say, listen, you have guns?  Yeah.  But we're going to sleep way over there.  You're not going to have a problem.  You're going to hear lion.  You're going to hear hyena.  You hear shit?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  This is what you hear.  Vroom. 
[02:13:30]  Vroom.  Vroom.  And you're in your tent.  Your eyes are bolts like a cartoon.  And you don't want to move or make a sound.  And the sweat, I literally could slide off my bed because I was sweating so bad.  Now, what I was really petrified about was in the tent next to us was my eight-year-old  daughter.  And she's staying with three other kids.  And they tell you, like, listen, don't turn on lights.  And don't make a noise in the night.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Because the animals just think it's a big tent. 
[02:14:00]  And then, you know, if you start going, oh, I'm in here.  And a curiosity.  Now it's a TV dinner, right?  Where's your bathroom, by the way?  Is there a bathroom in the tent?  There is a bathroom in the tent.  However, you have to unzip the back of your tent.  And then you're kind of in another section of the tent.  And then you've got to unzip that.  And literally, you're sitting on grass.  And there is a little bit.  I mean, it's not like staked down.  You know, a snake.  Anything could be.  So I was doing a lot of hovering.  You see ants and big bugs and beetles while you're. 
[02:14:30]  And all lights are off.  So you've got to kind of bring a flashlight.  All the generators, everything's off at night.  And the first night, he's like, listen, you know, you're going to hear lion and hyena.  Just stay in the tent.  And you're fine.  I promise you, you're fine.  But you hear hyenas are eerie.  You hear like.  What is that?  And then it's all around you. 
[02:15:00]  And you.  Oh, my God.  And you freaked out.  And then the second night, a freaking hyena went against our tent.  You can hear him walking on the mat.  And then he scraped against it and then sat in front of him for a second.  It was just complete.  He got up, walked away.  And then I remember D going, did you hear that?  And I'm like, yeah, they'll get hurt.  Just be quiet.  Just be quiet.  And we got out.  And there's, you know, there's this footprint in the morning right there. 
[02:15:30]  Holy shit.  And then you ask the guys.  And they're like, oh, yeah, he was, you know, they smell the food.  And they're like coming for the scraps.  My food.  I mean, to them, it's normal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, those stupid lines come around.  They went to freaking shaking legs.  Yeah, but can't you get a guy to stand in front of your tent with a gun?  Give him some extra?  You probably could.  But at the end of the day, they don't really bother you.  They don't stay up at night?  No, they go to sleep.  I would assume they would stay up at night and let you guys sleep.  No. 
[02:16:00]  They get a brand new crew in the morning.  They stay up a little bit, but no, they're up all night.  Now, the second is the first drive drive we go on.  Right.  But I'll post this.  I'll try to post this online.  We're videotaping, and there's three cars.  In the back car is them, just the adults, me and my wife, James, his wife.  The middle car is the teenagers, preteens.  The first car is my 8-year-old and one of his sons, his one son. 
[02:16:30]  And we come across these elephants, and elephants are kind of close, a little baby elephant.  And you're like, oh, my God, we're in Africa.  And then they freaking charge.  And they're videotaping.  You just see the camera go kaboom.  They're straight down.  And the thing charges my daughter's car, the 8-year-old, while she's sticking out of the top, hits it.  It's like Jurassic Park.  And drags it.  Holy shit.  About 10 feet.  And the whole time, I'm just visualizing getting tossed, crushed to death. 
[02:17:00]  They jump out of the car.  No guns.  The guy's clapping.  And you hear him going,  Come on.  I swear my life.  I'll send you the video.  Oh, I believe it.  And so the thing, then I pick up the camera.  Once he starts running away, and I pick him up, and he shakes his ears, and he kind of gives  us like a little F-you in his trunk.  Yeah, yeah.  And then takes off. 
[02:17:30]  And everyone then turns to me.  Did you get that video?  No, I didn't get a video.  I panicked.  And I wanted to see what was going to happen to Dean.  And my daughter's like, Oh, I got it.  I got it all.  And she did.  It kind of me.  I was kind of excited.  Oh, wow.  She's got the snapshot of the elephant pushing the car.  Holy shit.  And you see my daughter looking on like, Oh, my God.  Freaking elephant.  Was it a baby elephant that pushed the car?  No.  Oh, it was a full.  It was a full-grown.  It was one of the teenagers.  So how'd the guy fucking clap his hands and make the elephant go away? 
[02:18:00]  He says they think it's a gun.  And now they claim never, ever do elephants actually make contact.  Most of the time, they charge, and they'll get all the way up to the...  And they do that slide stuff.  And then they do slide stuff.  Right.  Their ears go out fucking real wide.  Right.  And it works, yeah.  Yeah.  And, but he goes, This was very unusual that he actually made contact.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Why wouldn't it be unusual? 
[02:18:30]  Why wouldn't it be unusual when I'm here?  Of course.  Of course it's unusual.  Why didn't the car drive when the elephant was charging it?  Our cars were off.  Because when we first got there, it spooked them, so we turned the engines off.  So you're sitting there, and you're taking in the ambiance and the elephant.  Did you complain to the manager?  The manager.  I'd like to see the supervisor, please.  The supervisor, please.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I love that fucking Disney Jungle Cruise.  Nothing fucking, nothing unexpected. 
[02:19:00]  God, you just assume they have it all figured out, like you're in tents and they're staying  up all night for you.  No, as a matter of fact, one night, one of the last nights, it was the greatest thing  in the world.  How long, by the way, was your trip?  Twelve nights.  Wow, okay.  So on one of the last nights, and you're in a different park every other night, one  of the last nights, we're all sitting around a fire, and it's before dinner.  Before dinner, one of the Zulu guys come to your tent, you get a flash of light, he  comes, picks you up with a spear, and he walks you to the fire, which is next to the 
[02:19:30]  dinner tent.  So you go there, and all of a sudden we hear like, and he gets a flashlight, and about  30 yards away, he's a freaking hippo.  Oh, shit.  And that's the first time I saw, that's the first time I saw that.  Don't look to your right, Jim.  Oh, you're right, sorry.  That's the first time I saw a safari guide panic a little.  He went, okay, everybody stay behind the fire, and start slowly backing up and head 
[02:20:00]  towards the tent.  Please go in the tent.  And out of all the animals in all of Africa, hippos are the most dangerous.  Yeah, they kill more people over there than any other animal.  I didn't know they attack on land.  I always thought like, oh, wait, people retarded?  You don't know in the water?  No.  They come up on land to graze, and like an elephant, and if they see you, they're heading  for you, and they snap you right in half of their jaw.  Jesus Christ.  So wait, did the hippo see you guys?  Of course he did, right?  He did.  And at one point, yeah, he was sideways. 
[02:20:30]  And when we flashed the light, he faced us.  Oh, man.  And that's when, that's when, and then the other guy picked up, and he tried to, he  stuck the lights in his eyes, and we all went behind the fire, because the fire is freaking  him out.  How primal is that?  Hey, we got to protect ourselves with fire.  Yeah, do you ever think you'd be hiding behind a fire from a fucking hippo?  Yeah.  In 2013.  This is going on television.  Yeah.  Right, I was in the real Survivor.  That was the real Survivor.  Jeez, no shit.  Do they have guns, the guys?  They got to have a gun.  They do have guns. 
[02:21:00]  Okay, so.  Because we, we would go on, guys, and they would, they would definitely have guns.  I'm sure it's the ultimate last resort to shoot one of them.  We just, we didn't even know.  We just, we went to the dinner tent, and once you're in the tent, he's not gonna, he's  not gonna bother you, and it's just too noisy, there's too many people, there's  fire, they don't want to mess with it.  Yeah.  But it was, it was sick.  Yeah, no kidding.  How big was it, man?  Awesome.  How big was the hippo?  Yeah.  Oh, man, he's probably about, probably a good, uh, eight, nine, probably like eight feet 
[02:21:30]  long.  He was a, he was a big hippo.  Do they not like being petted?  That's amazing.  I tried my damnedest, um, but no, he wouldn't.  If I had pictures, I'd, I gotta tell you, you know, everybody thinks that when cavemen,  uh, finally discovered fire, how to make fire, you always think of the cooking aspect  first.  It's like, oh, and heat and stuff like that.  But how fucking great must it have been to go like, wait a minute, everything that tries  to eat me is afraid of this shit?  That's right.  That's right.  It's like, gotta be the greatest fucking thing they ever came up on.  Like, we'll just put this shit out by, in front of the cave, and now no fucking things 
[02:22:00]  are gonna just sneak in and eat our babies, uh, tonight.  You're right.  You're right.  That's gotta be the most amazing thing.  It really was, and that, and, and, and that's the first time that thought process even went,  because the first thing he said was, get beyond the fire.  Fire.  Oh yeah, the animals are afraid of the fire.  I hate this shit.  This is great.  This is great.  Hey, this is great.  Get the fire!  You know what?  It's awful.  There's not an animal on the face of the earth that has figured out, except for man, how to  put that shit out. 
[02:22:30]  You know?  Like, there's not one other fucking animal that can put that fucking shit out.  And even we have trouble.  But at least, you know.  You would have, um.  Oh, that's fucked up, dude.  There was, uh, um, there was another, we, we went to this, this tribe in the middle of  the bush, middle of nowhere, and this one night we slept in these tents that weren't  even canvas.  They were see-through.  Oh, God.  They were like mesh tents.  So we're sitting there, and there's no big animals, but there's, there's, there's no  predators, so to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the mission was to find these guys called the Hazda tribe. 
[02:23:00]  They, they think that maybe they're the original man.  I don't know.  They're like our Indians.  They're nomads.  And we find them, and they take us hunting and show us how to make fire and all this stuff.  And, you know, you give them salt, and they're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Meanwhile, they're just African actors.  That's like, like Disney.  Right?  Right.  Oh, you just happened to find them.  And that's all I could keep thinking.  I'm like, no, you know this safari.  I was like, listen, I got these guys coming. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  The guy's in Metallica.  And the guy's in the van.  I can really use your help here.  I'll get some salt and a poison dart.  When they all get together, they sound like every cast member from The Wire in real life.  They're just like, oh, yes, well, we were out there in the bush.  That one guy looked like he was high all the time.  I see his kids look just as big as him.  It was crazy.  They took you hunting, though.  Dude.  That's pretty fucked up.  The best, but they separate you.  So you're only allowed to, quote, warrior. 
[02:24:00]  So me and my eight-year-old are following this guy through the freaking middle of nowhere.  And I started panicking because you really don't see anyone else, and you're in high  grass, and you're going around.  And he eventually kept going around these rocks, and he'd shoot out.  And then he finally came out with a spear through, like, one of those prairie-looking...  He looked like a prairie dog.  Yeah.  And the thing's still alive, like, and my daughter's traumatized.  Like, oh, my God.  And I'm going, oh, it's great. 
[02:24:30]  And he took his head and smashed it on a rock, and he smashed the thing, and he tied it up  to his waist.  Like, that's his lunch later.  It was pretty fucked.  When I put the whole thing together, I'll show you, like, little highlights of that.  It's freaking...  That was one of the best, when you see him just holding this thing up with an arrow through  and he smashes it and ties it up to his waist.  It's no big deal.  All right, let's keep continuing our journey.  Were there any hotels at all, like, when you first got there, or was it right to the bush?  We, when we landed, our safari guy picked us up, and the first thing I saw was the middle 
[02:25:00]  of the night, we were just on Dirt Road.  Oh, man.  We were in Tanzania, and you just see people wandering, like, the street.  There's, like, no shoes.  Where are they going?  That's...  I'm like, where are they...  Some people walk...  Where are they going?  There was a fish market we went to one day in the middle of the desert.  We had to drive, like, five hours in the desert to get from one destination to the other.  And people have, like, a donkey in the desert, and they're walking...  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:30]  Like a day and a half, two days, just to go buy some fish.  And the way they keep the fish fresh is they smoke it.  So they smoke it right there and just...  And they do this once a month, and they stack up on, like, enough fish to get them by.  And it's literally living in the middle of nowhere.  What did you eat?  Like, nowhere.  Oh, we ate, like, kings and queens, I'd say.  Did you eat well?  They brought in the good stuff.  Yeah, no.  This guy literally would set up dinner, like, a four-star restaurant every night in a tent.  It was a...  And one day, he surprised us.  We were in the middle of the Serengeti. 
[02:26:00]  And we wake up one morning, and we didn't have anything.  And then all of a sudden, we just stopped.  And they have this full-blown freaking buffet set up.  So we sit down, and we're eating.  It's freaking amazing.  And I started backing up, because the picture was amazing.  So I'm about maybe 50 yards away, and I'm snapping, shining.  I saw them video.  And they're going, hey, hey, hey, hey!  No, no, no, no, come back.  Come back.  So what do you think?  You can't wander off.  You got to stay in the group.  And then we finished breakfast, got in the car, and I don't think we drove 60 yards. 
[02:26:30]  And it was a whole Pride Alliance just hanging out.  Oh, fuck.  Underneath the tree with babies and everything.  They were probably just watching us, like, if this dope lingers any longer.  It's like anybody else watching an ice cream cake back up towards them.  Yeah, it was freaking awesome.  You weren't worried about the food or water getting sick? 
[02:27:00]  I was, but they supplied nothing but bottled water, and the food was unbelievable.  Really?  What kind of stuff did you eat?  Oh, yeah, we had steak.  We had chicken.  It was like curry chicken.  It was...  But did you eat any of that weird shit?  Hippo?  No, no, no.  Cheetah?  No, no, no, no, no.  And the guy, I mean, the safari guy literally flies to the States, and he goes over everything  you want to do and everything you want to eat.  Oh, wow. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  What kind of wine you want to drink, what kind of alcohol you like.  Damn.  Dude, you would love...  And if you're a hunter?  Yeah, Anthony would love it.  There is one element he might not care for.  You won't even have to deal with that, Ant.  You won't even have to deal with that.  That's hilarious.  Fucking Jimmy.  Totally different.  Totally different.  Oh, I know.  I've heard.  Totally different.  Yeah.  There's no music culture there.  No.  If that's what you're worried about.  Yeah, no, no.  Totally different culture.  What airline did you guys take? 
[02:28:00]  KLM.  Through Amsterdam.  Eight hours Amsterdam, eight hours to Kilimanjaro.  Out of L.A.?  Something like that.  No.  No, no.  Jersey.  It was unreal, man.  It was freaking awesome.  Sounds like a great time.  Dude.  You would like it.  I probably would.  You would really like it.  Yeah, I probably would.  But if you were to do it, do it through the people we went through.  I mean, it's literally, you don't have to see nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  They personally, they wait for you at the airport.  Jeez.  Get you.  Brings you to his, to his, he brings you to a freaking, his compound overnight. 
[02:28:30]  Overnight, and I mean, now I just watched the freaking movie, what do you call it, with  the, Django?  Oh, yeah.  I'm on the plane, I watch Django.  And then I show up at his compound, and you're like, wow, this reminds me a lot of the movie.  I mean, it's just, like they're waiting for you.  He's a white guy.  Oh, Jesus.  And they're waiting for you to pick up your, but I'm like, I got my bag.  Like, no, no, no, no.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God, anyway, I'm like, all right, all right, take my bag, you know, and I get  in, you know, and they, you stay in these amazing places. 
[02:29:00]  It's, uh, it's pretty awesome.  The worst of the week, Countdown.  No!  Continues.  You've done it.  And I hope you've been riding with me from the beginning.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You can hear me every morning on the Opie and Anthony Show, and after Opie and Anthony,  with, after Opie and Anthony Live.  Yes.  And, of course, the Sam Roberts Show, Sundays at 4 p.m. Eastern, here on this channel.  Number one this week on the Countdown, Fez's Breakdown.  Ron and Fez are the show that comes on after Opie and Anthony every weekday, I guess for 
[02:29:30]  the time being.  And Fez, earlier this week, had a bit of a breakdown.  It was, I mean, to me, it was very compelling radio.  It was emotional.  I don't know if it was meant for the radio.  It could be humiliating, but I'm a radio person.  I want it to be compelling no matter what.  I think you guys are the same way.  So you'll enjoy it, as I did, as Opie and Anthony break down the Fez's Breakdown.  Number one, here on the Countdown. 
[02:30:00]  Number one.  You got the audio cue to Fez worried about being replaced.  And Ron losing it.  Yeah, I figured we'll want to get to the meat of this shit.  Yeah, and we also had the live read that came after all this.  But that's just because he doesn't, you know, cookies makes him cry.  See, I love Ron and Fez, but I don't listen, because by the time they're on, we're off the  air, and I would go home and go to sleep. 
[02:30:30]  So listening to that yesterday, like knowing the dynamics just from being here, was interesting,  because I haven't listened to a huge hunk of the show.  And to hear that happening was a while.  And it goes to Jim's point about not knowing really what's going on on the show.  The whole thing started because Fez was upset that somebody called Jim's Advice Show  using the name Todd and giving out all of Fez's problems.  But Jim didn't even know they were Fez's problems.  Right, right.  And he was perplexed, by the way, trying to help this guy. 
[02:31:00]  The guy called on my Advice Show, and he was saying something like, I'm Todd.  Did we get that call?  We should have got that call.  Yeah, maybe we should get that.  And E-Rock let me know that he was bullshitting or whatever.  But it was interesting.  I forget what the guy said.  His father hosed him off or some shit.  Oh, yeah.  Out in the yard.  But here's the problem with that.  Oh, boy.  Because I heard it loud and clear.  Where Fez thinks it's an inside job.  Oh, yeah.  Fez thought that whole thing was an inside job.  That somebody actually called up? 
[02:31:30]  Well, the devious Sam Roberts probably put it together.  Yeah.  But Fez thinks that, you know, it's an inside job,  meaning someone that most likely works close to either us or Ron and Fez.  Right.  Even though it's pretty obvious that the guy just listens enough to the Ron and Fez show  where he picked up all the things he needed to.  So, I have the E-Rock clip from Jim's show if you want it.  All right.  Hope it until I get bored and then. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, but you don't want to.  Oh, what happened?  Sam, your lies are overwhelming.  We have Todd in New York has severe anxiety.  You know, it's funny, Todd.  I go through the bouts of this myself, which makes it hard for me to say,  Jim, how are you?  It's so funny listening to Jim trying to help this guy.  Yeah, I have a business partnership, and lately I've just been showing up to work,  and I don't pull my side.  You know what I mean?  Oh, I wouldn't know.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  Just because of the Todd in New York.  Do you know, I didn't know Fez's name was Todd. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, okay.  I swear, I didn't know Fez's name was Todd until yesterday.  It's easy to say that now, but knowing what we know, but I don't know.  I think I might have picked up on this one.  Dude, when I see the phone screens, though, and I see one guy, like, drinking,  kind of want to kill myself, and then this guy, with that, this wasn't so outlandish,  him saying that he didn't pull his share and his side in the partnership.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, yeah, all right, it happens.  There's some damaged people listening to this channel.  There's nothing but fucking creeps call my show.  This guy was, like, the healthiest.  It's a business partnership, and lately I've just been showing up to work, 
[02:33:00]  and I don't pull my side, yet my name's still on the business.  Okay.  And my business partners have been getting really upset with me.  Sure.  What are you anxious about?  Anything in particular?  Everything.  My sexuality, my mother.  Okay, well, those are big things.  So are you straight, and you think you might be bisexual or gay?  He's trying to help.  I think I'm asexual, but I think I'm gay.  Okay, wait a minute. 
[02:33:30]  So asexually, you're concerned because you don't get the urge to have sex very often?  Oh, gosh.  Right.  Were you abused sexually?  Not really.  My father did hose my ass out of the driveway once.  What do you mean he hose?  This guy knows all the details.  He knows all the little bits that have come out over the years.  Did your ass out with a real hose?  Yeah.  Now, why the driveway?  That's kind of publicly humiliating, no?  Yeah, yeah, it was.  So what was the motive of that?  Uh, I'm not sure. 
[02:34:00]  I'm not sure.  My father recently died, and I think he might have been a closet homosexual, perhaps a pedophile.  I'm not sure.  Jesus.  Oh.  Oh, is this fake?  Are you joking?  That was Iraq indicated.  Oh, there he goes.  There he goes.  Thanks, Iraq.  That's what got...  Yeah.  I was the only guy hung up instead of saying, yeah, because Iraq, I think, was making the  thing, like...  I kept going, no, it's fake, it's fake.  And then finally, when he said, hose my ass on the driveway, I was like, Jim, it's a fake  call.  Jimmy thought you were saying, I want a steak, I want a steak. 
[02:34:30]  You know?  So it went on longer.  You can't go for a steak.  I would love a lovely steak.  As long as it's not too spicy.  Yeah.  But then, like, hose in the driveway, like, what the fucking spices are?  But that was the, uh, that was one of the triggers that led to what happened yesterday  at Rana Fez.  By the way, I don't like that the one clip of my show we play on this show, it has to  be me going right to molestation.  Yes, yes.  But that was a fair question.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So, here's, uh, Rana Fez from yesterday. 
[02:35:00]  This is where it starts getting, uh, very good.  What does that mean?  I, it does, I don't know what it means.  No, I'm sorry.  What?  We should find out what they're, yeah, yeah.  Please, Sam, find out before you get me back kissed.  There's that dead air and then the, the Bennington sigh.  Luke, you're on the Rana Fez show.  Yeah, Fez, I won your fat, bratty old shirt about three weeks ago. 
[02:35:30]  I was just wondering if you want me to send that pack.  I'm just sitting in the packaging and, uh, I was like, you might miss it a little bit.  That doesn't help.  No, keep it.  It's an old, uh, Fez shirt.  Probably won't need it.  Oh, Christ.  What does that mean?  I, it does, I don't know what it means.  Then, when you do know...  I don't know what any of this means.  Well, when you do know, this would be the time to have a conversation.  But to come into some place and, are you asking anything specifically? 
[02:36:00]  No, you're not.  You're just saying you don't know what things are.  How could you not know what things are when you sat there and had the dinner?  Um, Lady Trucker.  Oh, no.  Yes, uh, Fez, what are these changes that you think are going on?  It's not your fucking business.  You know, I don't want to put ideas in people's head, and it's really none of your business. 
[02:36:30]  And I wouldn't bring it up on the fucking show, Fez, if it's none of her business.  I don't know what the changes are.  I know Tommy Rhodes is coming in here tomorrow.  I don't know what that's about.  Why is all of a sudden, I didn't see his name on a booking sheet or anything.  I don't know why Tommy Rhodes is all of a sudden coming in here.  Tommy Rhodes is one of the best fucking comedians on the planet Earth.  He's an old friend of mine, he's an old friend of ours, and he's stopping by tomorrow.  It just seems weirdly coincidental. 
[02:37:00]  In what way?  Because I don't know what's going on with me and this company.  Yes, you do.  I was expecting to hear last night.  And the Russians are trying to take over, and the colonel left the messages in the drop box,  but I have to do the mathematics.  What's that from?  Beautiful Mind.  Oh, yeah!  This is like...  Yeah.  Go to Fez's house and there's just fucking magazines and newspapers stuck to the wall with threads connecting words. 
[02:37:30]  Supposedly no one's allowed in Fez's house anymore.  Maybe. Uh-oh.  He announced that on the radio, I think.  Yeah, a couple days ago, they said Fez stopped cleaning his house, so he doesn't let people...  Getting new radio transmissions from the military!  Did he stop cleaning his house?  That's what he said on the show.  Oh, boy.  It seems weirdly coincidental.  In what way?  Because I don't know what's going on with me and this company.  Yes, you do. 
[02:38:00]  I was expecting to hear last night at the going-away party.  Going-away party.  Jesus.  He's perplexed.  Right back.  Right of his...  Right there.  He's just exasperated.  And incidentally, here's the important part that no one's picking up on.  Right.  How about fuck-o Tim Sabian takes this show out for a nice steak dinner at the Friars Club?  I was thinking the same thing. 
[02:38:30]  Tim, how about that?  A bunch of steaks for the boys.  I was thinking the same thing.  We're in this fucking little shitty office down the hall every fucking meeting.  And they're living it up at the Friars Club with this spicy steak.  Laughing.  Laughing their asses off.  Laughing.  Talking to Jerry Stiller.  Jerry Stiller having their spicy steaks.  Most of them were laughing.  Yeah.  One guy not happy.  We're sitting here in this fucking hovel.  A hovel.  I live in a hovel.  One guy couldn't read the room.  Holy shit.  You want to continue with this?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I just wanted to ask Fez if he feels that he's being selfish, that he would get  mad that everybody around him wants to change things because nothing has changed with him  and they just want to move on.  And, you know, you get mad at Ron and these guys, I don't understand it because it's you  that, you know, has to make a change for everyone else to feel happy.  Do you want them to just sit and be sad all day while they have to do their job?  They want to be happy, too, you know?  I don't think it's selfish.  You just want to know what's going on in your own place of business. 
[02:39:30]  Can you pause that real quick?  Yeah, that was not even.  In that moment is probably what's the most frustrating.  It's like that guy asked a legit question.  Right.  And it's like, Fez, it is selfish.  Not to be, Fez is right there.  To be concerned about what's going on in your place of business is not selfish.  But that wasn't the point the guy was making.  And that's not what's happening there.  That's what he heard.  But that wasn't the point the guy was making.  He didn't even hear the guy talk.  He just waited for him to stop talking.  That was a legitimate question. 
[02:40:00]  That was a very legit question.  And fucking selfish at all.  What else could be really going on?  I mean, it's been years now, so what do you think?  Why don't you fucking ask me, Fez?  Because I'm the fucking person.  All right?  No one down the hall.  I'm the fucking person.  Ask me.  Instead of anybody else.  I don't know if I want to keep hearing bitching every fucking day.  I'm going nuts with it.  I started getting spaghetti against the wall fucking flashbacks.  I was listening to this and I'm like, oh no, daddy. 
[02:40:30]  Daddy, please stop yelling.  Stop yelling.  I got a stomachache.  Just between the two shows.  The issues and mental illness that runs rampant through this fucking room is astounding.  That's what makes for good radio.  Oh my God.  As long as I keep it to fucking gather.  Duct tape your shit back together.  Fez, you're still standing.  Like, you just got to start.  It's all up to him.  It's up to you, Fez.  Whatever that means. 
[02:41:00]  If that means taking a break from radio, getting better help, I don't know.  I don't live in his world, but something's got to change.  When you get the benefit of the doubt from everyone around you for years, you might have  to turn that old viewfinder around on yourself.  Because everybody likes him.  Yeah.  Behind the scenes, we like you, Fez.  We really do.  It's not being polite.  This show is too self-destructive to be overly fake polite to Fez.  Right.  Yeah.  And we like you.  Everybody wants to see you succeed. 
[02:41:30]  So for the constantly scheming Sam Roberts.  Yeah, and the company in general, and all that talk.  Down the hall.  But no, everyone's rooting for the guy.  In the halls, he's still a fun guy, actually.  I see him every day.  He's fucking pleasant.  I know.  He's very nice.  Right, right.  And then, I don't know, something with his confidence when he comes in here.  Yeah.  Continue that clip there, Sam.  Bitching every fucking day.  I'm going nuts with it.  I want to fucking do a show about something. 
[02:42:00]  You haven't jumped into one goddamn topic.  I'm the person you got the fucking beef with.  And you fucking talk around me as if I'm not.  I'm not talking around you.  I'm talking...  I'm fucking telling you, I don't know what I want to do.  And I've been up front about that.  And if the people down the hall want to fucking scramble to offer us each some things to do,  then that should be a good thing.  But I'm going fucking crazy from the craziness. 
[02:42:30]  It doesn't feel right with them scrambling around thinking of stuff,  because that was always me and you.  I...  Why would I scramble around to do this with you if you're going to fucking do it with me?  You are unhappy.  I can't make you happy.  Don't blame that on anybody else.  What an odd discussion that you're meant to be having.  If you wanted to do fucking radio again, we would.  But are you doing radio today?  Are we getting into any of these topics? 
[02:43:00]  Or are you just bitching?  Say nothing.  This is where I'd look at my radio today.  I haven't paused.  I thought the fucking YouTube thing is...  No one fucking started this.  I didn't pause it.  But me.  I started it.  Money works dead air like no other person.  You mention it and then people come crawling out of the woodwork to get between us.  They don't fucking crawling out of the woodwork to get between us.  They're saying...  Yeah.  Let's look at some options. 
[02:43:30]  I have one point from the outside.  Fez, I love Ron.  We all like Ron.  Yeah.  But let's be real honest.  Nobody is trying to get between you guys to get close to Ron Bennington.  Right.  We like Ron.  Everyone has their own shit to worry about.  They have their own shit to worry about.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to get between Ron and Fez.  Nobody looks at them and goes, if only he was out of the picture, I could be close to Ron.  We don't think of that.  It does sound like something more than just a professional working relationship based on Fez's end of this. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, you're hearing things that people don't...  They don't talk like that unless they're in a relationship.  Thank you.  You know, it's...  Well, radio shows, you get really close to these fucking people.  But hearing that, hearing that, you said a tone of that, like getting between us.  There's something different.  Right.  That used to be us.  Right.  But it's like nobody's interfering with that.  No.  Nobody's jumping in and going, Ron, you get in this room, Fez, you get in that room.  No one.  But he's feeling that Ronnie has finally had it. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  That's where all that's coming from.  And it's a long time coming.  You know, something different needs to be figured out.  Yeah.  And that doesn't mean Fezzy loses his gig.  No.  They don't fucking crawling out of the woodwork.  They're saying, let's look at some options.  Mikey D shows up after years.  Mikey D has nothing to do with anything.  What does that mean? 
[02:45:00]  I told you before.  But you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Hi.  Turn your radio down, dude.  Sorry about that, man.  I know.  I was just saying that, you know, with Fez's paranoia, he's creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
[02:45:30]  So, you know, if he feels bad things are going to happen, he's creating this himself in his mind.  Dude, I want to learn how to change his mindset.  Because the more you dwell on it, the more it's just going to keep bringing it to people's attention,  things that they might not have thought of.  You follow what I mean?  I was dwelling on it all last night.  That's nothing to brag about.  That's not your fucking job to dwell on stuff. 
[02:46:00]  It's your job to bring up fun topics that we can all talk about.  That's your fucking job.  When's the last time you brought up a topic or got involved in a topic that wasn't negative and angry?  What happened to the fun?  It started to drive me crazy.  Yeah, Roddy loves fun.  And I don't know if it's a self-fulfilling prophecy if something's already been decided that I don't know about.  Dude, if there was something to be decided, 
[02:46:30]  why would you have been fucking invited to the dinner where we all talk?  And so was Chris.  Because this affects Chris's mind.  Who's Chris?  Pepper.  Pepper Hicks.  Oh, okay.  Chris Stanley.  Oh, what?  That guy?  Chris and Stanley and Pepper and Hicks.  Jesus, that's five people.  Yeah.  See, but Feds knows something.  That must have been an expensive dinner.  Yeah.  He smells something.  It's almost like you smell smoke in the room and you know you smell smoke,  but he's misidentifying the source of it.  Right.  But the fact that he smells smoke is right. 
[02:47:00]  But it is crazy that he thinks people are talking about him behind his back when he's there for the conversations.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's in denial that it's Ron who's changing.  He thinks people got in Ron's ear.  Right.  And that's absolutely not true.  That's it.  He's in denial.  Ron's been a fucking saint.  Ron is changing.  And Ron is changing.  Yeah.  But he thinks that can't possibly be true.  There are people talking to Ron.  They're talking in his ear.  And even when Ron came to me and said, you know, hey, buddy, do you want to do a show? 
[02:47:30]  I was like, you know what, dude?  I don't, I don't, I'm not going to be happy with that.  Have fun with that.  You're terrible.  Have fun with that one.  I can't wait for later on today.  Ron will have to tell Feds that was a joke.  Well, I don't know if it was.  Where's our, Tuesday, what do we got?  The meeting in his fucking Tim's glass sarcophagus down the hall?  Is that it?  Or do we get steak?  No, we don't get that at all. 
[02:48:00]  They'll probably bring in steak and fucking make them up in the.  Steak.  You know how smoky that room we get?  That'd be great.  I bet you they made him fucking take the drapes off his window because you would pull his slacks tight and you'd have to, like, look left or right where his cock head was.  Chad and Marilyn, this whole situation started last week when Ron sat in on your show.  Yeah, I want to say that again.  Oh, yeah.  Ron had a really good time, was feeling good about himself.  He was just sitting around throwing the ball around, fucking laughing and joking, all light and easy.  And he says at one point during yesterday's show, he said, because, of course, Fezzy was upset about these guests that he apparently didn't know about that were coming in. 
[02:48:30]  And Ronnie's like, I just want to talk to somebody.  He goes, I'd have my old lady, the neighbor, come in just so he could talk about something.  Right.  You know, and then he has to, he goes on his show and has to feel bad about the fact that he just did our show.  That's all that was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He likes to do our show from time to time. 
[02:49:00]  Ugh.  Why would that happen if it was being fucking sneaky?  Because I thought something was going to be said last night.  It wasn't.  You dropped, that's like the fork with the finger of God.  Snap paused.  Yeah.  No.  I'm going to jump out of this fucking building one day. 
[02:49:30]  I'm just going to go to the goddamn window and jump out of the building.  It doesn't even make sense.  Wow.  Lorenzo, you're on the run of Fez's show.  All right.  Well, after that, I don't know what to say.  But, yeah, people are pretty annoying, the guys that do the inspirational quotes all the time, constantly.  But you've got to look in, man, to see the outside world.  All day, every day. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, well, you get those from a lot of women.  There's women in my family that would like to send me that stuff.  The best man.  Yeah.  And sometimes I fucking change them up and come up with the best and send it back to them.  Nicky, you're on the run of Fez's show.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to say I started listening maybe a couple weeks ago. 
[02:50:30]  And I thought Fez was the other guy.  I didn't even realize.  I mean, Fez, I guess he hasn't been talking much lately.  But so that's worth admitting.  But I also want to say, Fez, you're taking a lot of bullshit, man.  These guys aren't exactly respecting you.  So if you do his job, who really gives a shit, man?  Just have fun and be confident.  It's not my plan to get fired.  Look, Fez, this guy's been listening for two weeks.  He understands the dynamics. 
[02:51:00]  I'm Chris, by the way.  I'm the other.  You better figure out how to fucking explain yourself, too.  Yeah.  I'll tell you this.  Right now, today, you look like the catcher for the show.  Because you've got a fucking hat on backwards.  And you're not in the game.  Calling signals.  You know you're past 30 where you can even get away with that kind of shit.  Yankee fan, let's show it off.  Tries to keep it a little light.  Yeah.  Hey, Ronnie, I don't even know how to follow that. 
[02:51:30]  Good act that you just laid out there.  But Fez, you should take Ronnie's advice.  The guy loves you to death.  It's put up or shut up.  And maybe you guys take a fucking long lead.  Make yourself well and figure it out.  Because you used to be funny as well.  Fuck it.  It's really getting tired of listening to it all the time, buddy.  I wish you the best.  There's not a fucking...  The option came up that we could take a fucking sabbatical.  I don't know.  A lot of different options came up.  Which is Fez is acting like negative today.  And I'm telling you something.  Obviously, I wasn't going to come in and talk about any of them until after we're settled. 
[02:52:00]  But the last thing I would do when a vice president from the company says that we like you guys and we want you to feel good about yourselves.  And if you need to take time off, six months or whatever, I get it.  You've been doing radio a long time.  The last thing I would do is come back and shit on that person and disrespect them by acting like something else is being fucking held back.  That sounded like he just wanted to get me out the door. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, Christ.  And I wasn't going to give in to it.  Give in to what?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Guess what, dude?  This isn't about you.  All right?  For once, it's not fucking about you.  It's about me.  Huh.  And that's why I didn't fucking go in there and say, I want you to fire Fez.  I know you would never do that.  But I don't know what other things are operating around here. 
[02:53:00]  God damn it.  Hit play.  I'm sorry.  Charlie, you're on the run of Fez show.  Hey, Ron, you're just wasting your breath, man.  He's not listening to the one thing you're saying.  Bravo.  No, he's not.  Whatever the expression is, hearing you but not listening, whatever that stupid expression  is, he's hearing your words but he's not listening to anything you're saying.  Wrong dumbbell. 
[02:53:30]  Listening but not hearing it.  You're just wasting your breath by even getting mad or whatever.  I feel bad for you, man.  Thanks.  Play?  Play?  You know, it's just playing.  What?  It's not paused.  Can't be.  It's radio.  Why don't you be understanding?  Because you were at that dinner last night.  Not even a meeting.  Yeah, it was.  A very nice dinner.  It was really a great night.  Fun night.  Yeah, it was really fun.  I thought...  How could anything negative have been taken out of that night? 
[02:54:00]  I thought it was a pause.  We were basically there with what I consider the mayor of the Friars Club.  It was like showing up at a Catholic place with the Pope.  Tim.  We had a blast.  Is there a lot?  I guess.  Fuck him.  I want to go.  That's so many cool people.  It was really just a fun...  I mean, this is really long.  I mean...  Yeah, we could go on.  So they...  I don't know.  Then they went to break a little later on in there, in this discussion, because we're  not going to play the whole thing.  It's really long.  Yeah.  The clip is online, though.  I tweeted late last night.  Go to my Twitter or... 
[02:54:30]  Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.  I thought you were going to go to jimnorton.com tours and see it under there.  When he brought up the blueberry thing.  Right.  And he's talking about, what is it, like, scripture?  Yeah, it's like a Bible, everybody.  Right.  It's just a funny moment.  I know.  We're going to fucking bomb and get ourselves in a weird position when you do radio.  And then it's exploited.  Yeah.  It's hilarious. 
[02:55:00]  He wasn't the blueberry guy every day.  We used to do a bit called Bombs and Flubs, where it was a million blueberry moments.  Right.  But he can't take that.  He can't take that.  The blueberry thing has become something.  I don't think he likes the blueberries.  So they're in commercial break, and Fez's got to do a live read, and this is how it went down.

Because it starts out, you can tell he's a little upset, and as it goes on, it gradually  and subtly, you could tell he's getting more and more upset as the read goes on.  Right.

Have you ever, though, ever, in your whole radio career, life, listening to radio, ever heard  anything like that?  Aside from the Hindenburg crash, DJ guy?  I mean, that is, there's just something going on there that's, like, beyond anything I've 
[02:57:30]  ever heard in my life.  Yeah.  It's a sad, it's a very sad cookie read.  When they came back, somebody said something about cookies.  Ron said, do you have, you don't have, right, when they came back from that?  When they came back, he's, like, talking about the cookie, and the guy goes, I'm not getting  those cookies, that's very sad.  Ron goes, nah, Ms. Fields, it's a fine cookie.  You're not a fine cookie.  He calls them fine cookies.  Fine cookies.  Trying to save the sponsor.  It's a fine cookie.  People are not going to forget Mrs. Fields' Cookies anytime soon. 
[02:58:00]  No, that's way better than just a fucking straight-ahead read.  Oh, my God, is it?  I just played it.  It was a little sad, even though.  It was sad at first.  As a human being, it's got to be sad, but then I turned quickly and said, enough already.  Go ahead.  But I got to where I was really enjoying listening to you guys.  Besides just that, I don't know if it's a bit.  I don't know if he's gone mental.  It's ridiculous.  Listen to that commercial.  I literally just wanted to smash my radio. 
[02:58:30]  He's got to figure something out.  I don't know if this is the best place for him to be anymore.  What happened?  The video's still playing.  The show's still playing?  Oh.  Seriously?  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, I was just getting emotional during the...  Yeah.  We were all aware of that, and you were emotional during the entire time.  I'm just going to throw this out there.  Oh, no.  Please, Ronnie, don't change anything. 
[02:59:00]  Please.  Oh, even Christ.  I'm just asking you.  It's been a long time, and I'm just saying, Ronnie, do not do this.  Don't let them do this to us.  Fez.  Don't do it, Ron.  Fez, can I just say something to you?  I literally...  Don't let him change this.  Oh.  I prefer angry Fez to this.  I prefer angry Fez to this, he says. 
[02:59:30]  Don't do it.  I'm just...  I don't know how else to put it up there.  This is going great.  Don't do it.  Can I just ask you to do something?  Have some respect for yourself, dude, and for us, instead of this.  O-M-G.  Yes, John Montone.  O-M-G, indeed.  This is what everybody wants.  Let's do it.  Okay.  Nobody wants any of this.  Don't let them. 
[03:00:00]  I was only joking.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car. 
[03:00:30]  Be more funny.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Oh, no.  That's going to be a problem.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, no.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, no.  Okay, terrific.  That's an attention getter.  I'm scared.  Oh, no.  It's still playing.  Yeah.  Dear Lord Jesus.  This ain't happening, man. 
[03:01:30]  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  Shame.  Oh.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Don't you do it.  Don't.  You.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go. 
[03:02:00]  I got nothing else.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Oh, no.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.

She used to see you  When she was with Bobcat  She used to see you at Uncab all the time  Oh, that's right  And you were there  And you said  When your TiVo thought you were gay  TiVo thought I was gay 
[03:11:00]  She remembers the Patton Oswalt stories very well  Oh  And when you guys were talking about comics  That will wear certain clothes on stage  And then their first joke  Just to get the first joke out of the way  Yes  Like, what am I doing in this Hawaiian shirt?  Yeah, that's  Brian pointed that out  Brian Posehn  Their guys, their whole first five minutes was  I can't  How did this get on?  What is going on?  What did I blow Don Ho?  I know what you're thinking  Yeah  That's the other big one  Anybody that hits the stage  I know what you're thinking  How did the bouncer get on stage?  Yeah 
[03:11:30]  None of us thought you were the bouncer  I worked with a guy who  He would  He came on stage to the theme  To the show  The Broadway show Hair  And he had  He was a white dude with his hair just  In this insane bushy thing  And he would  And then he would do five minutes on  I can't  Can you believe this shit?  What's going on?  What is going  What is this?  I'm gonna kill that barber  But before the show  He needed an hour in the condo  To get like 
[03:12:00]  To do his hair up  And it  Don't bother me  Don't talk to me  I gotta  Yeah  So he was just trapped  For five minutes of material  An hour of every one of his days is gone  I like the suspension of disbelief to that comic  That his comedy IQ is so low  That he blames a barber for hair being long  Yeah  Yeah  Like what's with this barber?  Can you believe this?  I asked him to give me a trim  I don't know  It's weird  He actually made me  He made this weird white guy fro  I didn't know they could do that  I also  I'm gonna sue him  Comedians of comedy  When you 
[03:12:30]  Friday farts  Only because we were talking about  The Z morning zoo shows  We always have to do Friday fart song  Friday fart song  Leah Remini is hot, Patton  Yeah, oh god  Well I think Friday fart song was something that  David Cross  I think he actually had to do  He was on a radio show one morning  And they literally had a Friday fart song  And that is always  That's one of my go-tos for bad radio  Is a Friday fart song  Which  But I think  I do it as a joke  I think he had to actually experience and live that  So I don't even know what that 
[03:13:00]  And Cross is not a guy to like  Just join in in the chorus  No  In the Friday fart song  He beats to his own drum  No, and he  That guy has done  It's weird how a guy like that has done  Has had some of the worst radio experiences ever  Yeah  Nightmare radio experiences  You talk about like Colin Quinn  Who told me on the podcast  He said his act has always been a bit of a dog whistle  And like David Cross is another guy  Yeah  It just it doesn't have the rhythm  That like you or I have  New  And you have a bit of a dog whistle 
[03:13:30]  Like you  What I like about your stand up is  It's really honest  It's really honest  Like when you just tell the audience  I fucking hate New York  I can't stand being here right now  The knee jerk reaction is like  What?  But then you explain in great detail  What happens here in New York  And it's madness ensues  Yeah  You first of all  Thanks for coming on  Because I know how busy you are  And we were talking about it  There's nothing worse than going  Oh I'm so sorry I'm so busy  Which pisses people off  But I thought you and I handled it like gentlemen  Yes  And I said hey I'd much rather be  And I would much rather be your friend

Oh I thought you said pounce  Oh the more pounce is even better 
[03:14:30]  We got pounced by more  They pounce on it  A little more  Actually I like the more more  The more more  Yeah  I bet you get that all the time  You get a lot of  So when you were growing up  People were like hey I want a little more  Did you get that a lot?  Come on  We're live with Bob Sugar in the studio  Bob Sugar's a fictional character  And that always takes the wind out of their sails  That was all they had man  Well there's an actress Martha Plimpton  Who just she had to do a massive radio tour 
[03:15:00]  She's on the show Raising Hope  And she was writing about her on her Facebook  And she was rattling off all the you know  Just fake DJ names she was making  We do that with Flappy and Levine  One of the ones she made up was Oblivious Charles  Which to me is the perfect morning  Because there's always the guys that are trying to get the party going  And then there's the guy that is just as tired as you  And has no energy and cannot get  And you can't get anything going with him  Yeah 
[03:15:30]  So we got a guy here from  You have a TV show?  You're on TV right Shane?  Well not I used to be  Used to be okay  Now I'm doing radio  So he has a radio show on TV I think  Is it on TV?  No radio is on the radio  Okay he's a comedian and  He'll be at a  You're at a club right?  I am at a club  Okay let's hear some of those jokes you'll do tonight  I don't really tell jokes  Just do some of your jokes  I do stories mostly about like  What happened in my life  Let's hear a story right now  A story right now?  Yeah go ahead  Like Little Red Riding Hood or  I'm just gonna cut my mic off for a second 
[03:16:00]  Oblivious Charles puts his face in his hands  I'm done  And then there's always the guy whose job it is to like  Actually eat vomit out of the garbage can  Yes!  Like here's Squeaky  Make Squeaky do it  That's right  If you guys throw up in the trash can  After you eat all those eggs  Squeaky will eat it  Right Squeaky?  And Squeaky's like sure  That's right  Like he has no idea that there's other ways to succeed in radio  Than letting Hooters girls cane him  There was a guy  There was a guy  I was in San Francisco 
[03:16:30]  And I did a morning show  And they had a guy  They  Someone peed in a Brita filter  You know those  The Brita filter  And he peed in it  And then let it go through  And then he drank it  And that was his  And that was his thing  And he was a regular like  They would think of horrible things for him to do  Well there goes that sponsor  Thanks a lot  Sorry Brita  No pee  Oh pee  I was really banking on that  I didn't know that  There's a big pee lobby right now  That you don't know about  I didn't know there was a whole big  Huge  P lobby that you were not aware of  They're in Washington right now  Holding yellow signs 
[03:17:00]  That was the easy way out of that one  Just blank yellow pieces of paper  That's all you need  Very esoteric  What do you think post-it notes are?  Very  Oh my god  You didn't think of that?  You're the brains of this organization  So the reason this got expedited  You need to do this first?  Nope  If you do we don't care  No  I cannot emphasize enough  This is very laid back  And if this is the easiest thing of your day  Then I've completely failed  My wife is getting a new phone  And she needs the Verizon passcodes 
[03:17:30]  And stuff like that  Which I don't have on me in my head  So I don't know what to do right now  I always write them down someplace  And then I forget where I put them  Exactly yeah  I have a feeling I did write them down  And they're missing  Yeah  Yeah  If someone trying to hack my phone  Could easily find them  He could find where I hid them  I just can't  Or just guess  Exactly  I think I read somewhere  No I read  The number one password in the world  Is the word password  For most people's computers  Smart  You gotta get closer to that mic sweetheart  Oh  Smart 
[03:18:00]  Sorry  There you go  Pat and Oswald joining us  I'm on so much Dayquil right now  M-O-H-R  M-O-H-R  Live coming at you  Big thanks to that Steve Vai song  Taking us to break  We're back now with Pat and Oswald  Little forward coming in the break  Thanks a lot  What expedited this appearance though  Last Comic Standing got rebooted  Yeah  I'm removed from all responsibilities  How far removed have you been from it?  How many seasons were you involved  And then you were removed?  The moment  Last season three  They took the comedian out of the house  Uh huh  And I said well now you're just doing 
[03:18:30]  Evening at the Improv  Right  I don't want to host this  Uh huh  I thought what was important was the show comics  Cause I lived next door to Dave Rath  Uh huh  For about eight years  Doug Benson, Brian Bessane, Todd Glass  Like it was just a cacophony  Of laughter all the time  And I wanted to capture like  What it's like when comics live together  So I wanted to be like the real world  And comics  And the thing  And uh NBC has ideas  Like we can  Right  We can vote people off  So when the comics  After season three  Uh when NBC said  We're no longer going to have  The comedians in the house 
[03:19:00]  Then I said well I don't want to host  I put my foot down  And they said well then  We're going to look for another host  And I said okay  And they got Tony Clark  And then they got Bill Bellamy  Yeah yeah  And now I think they just hired  Wanda Sykes who's great  As an executive producer  Right  But I still don't know who's going to host  Right  But you uh tweeted  It's a very funny tweet by the way  Uh to catch a predator  Is better for your career  Than being on last comic standing  If you're a comedian  Well  I don't understand  I don't understand  But it seems uh  Almost entirely from the 
[03:19:30]  To put you in that category  I know you're not an alternative comic  Cause you're very mainstream  Right  But the alternative comics  Uh seem to really loathe  The concept  The execution  Well  And the existence  Of last comic standing  To which I ask you on twitter  Uh comics  Like Doug Benson for example  No yeah yeah yeah  On TV as Doug Benson  Eight minutes at a pop  What's the problem  No that's  That wasn't my problem  With the show  My problem actually  Was the idea  That uh  It's a show 
[03:20:00]  It's a once again  It's another one of these  Things that takes comedy  And boils it down to  It all comes down to one shot  It all comes down to five minutes  And that makes your career  And I just thought that  That was a really  That's just a really bad representation  Of how you actually  Eventually make it as a comedian  Oh sure  It actually takes a very  Very long  Long time  And I don't like  I don't like any art form  Reduced to a  Um  To 
[03:20:30]  To just a  A competition with points  And numbers  And stuff like that  But I've never seen you tweet  About Project Runway  Here's my  Because Project Runway  And Top Chef  Are the two reality shows  I actually like  And here's why  Because they  Are  Meritocracies  They are based on merit  Here is an actual skill  You've either made a dress  That is wearable  You've eaten something  You've cooked something  That is edible and tasty  But comedy is so  Uh  Comedy and eroticism  You can't argue them 
[03:21:00]  I think I'm quoting Gene Siskel on this  But if it makes  Gene Simmons  Or Gene Simmons  God knows  But if something makes you laugh  Or something gives you a boner  Then it has worked  And it made it  It made comedy  It narrowed it down  Especially in the early seasons  To a very narrow  The focus  As to what  Well  But also in the later season too  I thought  I didn't like any of the seasons  I never  None of this discussion will hurt my feelings  Okay okay  At any point  Just so you know  I don't like American Idol  For the same reason  They take these  They also try to do this myth 
[03:21:30]  And I  I think this is a very dangerous myth  And  And I'll bring it back to Top Chef  Which  Some early  Early seasons of Top Chef  I didn't like one aspect of them  I thought was bad  Which is  Sometimes talent  Just comes out of nowhere  Well no  That's not true  Right  Because everyone who's ever won  On American Idol  Has ten years of experience  As a professional singer  They're not stars  But they are session singers  They sing professionally  They're total stars  And so this  Everyone who's ever really made it  On 
[03:22:00]  On Last Comic Standing  Either were total stone cold  Professionals  Or  They were somebody that was  Way too young  But had just the right  Nugget of material  To get them through  But then they weren't ready  Right  And I  And it drives me crazy  When young comedians  Who are full of all this promise  They get grabbed too early  And it kind of screws up their  Career  Where when I see  I am  I am so glad  That  My first  Pretty much  Six years of comedy  Were undocumented  Unheralded 
[03:22:30]  Nobody was watching me  I got to go through  All my dumb phases  I got to work out  All of my influences  And  And  Become who I was  Yeah  But if  Last Comic Standing  Had been around  And I had been 19  A I would have totally  Tried to get on it  And it would have frozen me  In a very  I think  Bad  Part of my career  Rather than leaving me alone  And letting me be  Do you know what I'm saying  I know exactly what you're saying  The flip side  The point  The counterpoint  I could take is  It's up to the individual 
[03:23:00]  And I think  A bigger problem in comedy  Is that comics  Like you put in  Extraordinary  Hours  Hours  Hours  And I've said on the podcast  For over two years  Like comics  Under the age of 36  They don't know what it's like  To drive to Buffalo  For like a hundred bucks  Realizing they're actually  Losing money  Oh god  But if I could just make a name  For myself there  Next time I'll come back  As the headliner  How much do I get  I'll stay in town  I'll hang out at the improv  They don't know what it's like 
[03:23:30]  To dig and dig and dig  And dig and dig  Yeah  So I think it's up to the individual  Like if you get a guy  Like John Heffern for example  Who won when it went to  Comedy Central  I think  Like John Heffern's a guy  That is still putting in the work  And he's still constantly  Writing jokes  And then there were guys  Like Dat Fan  A season one winner  Who in your  You summed it up perfectly  Had the perfect  Five minutes  Yes  Text I like him the most  And I think the house element  Worked against Dat Fan  Because everybody bullied him 
[03:24:00]  And everybody that was like  You know Rich Voss and Ralphie May  Were being creeps  Right  Voted for Dat Fan  As like a  To get back at the other guys  But I think it's up to the individual  Like I don't think  Like I don't think  When you're on Last Comic Standing  And you're not ready  That ruins your career  If you go to Last Comic Standing  And then you're still willing  To put in the work  Like Alonzo Bowden  Like no one writes more  Than Alonzo Bowden  And John Heffern  And Ralphie always has  Hours and hours  Of material  I agree with all that  And I think there were  A lot of great comedians  Look 
[03:24:30]  For everything I had  For all the problems I had  With the show  It gave Doug Benson  A lot of exposure  It gave Todd Glass  I thought amazing exposure  Eddie Pepitone  It let people see  What Todd Glass does  And how he kind of  Screws with the form  But it also helps  I think  To calcify  A form  And a method  Of doing stand-up  That I think  Ultimately hurts  Stand-up  And that's  Five minutes  For all the marbles  Yeah  It all comes down 
[03:25:00]  It doesn't all  It never ever  Comes down to one  If it came down  If your career  Came down to  It's one set  Then I would have  No career  Because my  My big audition  For Conan O'Brien  Happened on  Latino Comedy Night  At the  At the  Laugh Factory  I'm not kidding  Laugh Factory  Carlos Mencia was the host  And he  And look  God bless him  We all have problems  With Carlos  But here's how  He brought me on 
[03:25:30]  Alright this next guy  He's a white guy  Give him a chance  Give him a chance  And it went boom  They're immediately  Screaming at me  So that was my  It comes down to this  Five minutes  Well then your five minutes  Are done  Then I should be  But no you keep  You just keep going  Even though  Now you could  I'm gonna make an argument  On yours  For you actually  Now that I'm  Running my mouth  And I'm realizing  Now we'll switch sides  I'll be anti  Last Comic Standing  Maybe being on  Last Comic Standing  And being on too early  Or being exposed 
[03:26:00]  In the wrong  Getting over that  Makes someone a better  Comedian down the road  Right  Maybe that's part of it  Maybe Last Comic Standing  Is just a  Maybe Last Comic Standing  Is just a mega version  Of the one nighter  That you drive to in Buffalo  And you realize  You're actually losing money  You know  Yeah  Like a lot of those guys  To do Last Comic Standing  They couldn't go do road gigs  And they maybe lost some money  In the short run  Yeah but I think in the long run  The exposure certainly helped  Yeah and I also think like  You're right in that 
[03:26:30]  It never comes down to one set  One moment  Yeah  It's not a rap battle  It drives me crazy  And you know I've always said like  When people radio  Going back to the Z Morning Zoo  Radio shows  When they say like  What was your big break  And I always say  I don't say it on the air  Because I don't want to sound like a jerk  But you know I'll say it to you  If you have one break  Then life is horrible  Yeah  We've all  If you really  Anybody listening to this  If you really look back in your life  You've had about 26 breaks  That 20 
[03:27:00]  At least yeah  Like that many things went right  Along the way  And they were all dressed up  As hard work  Like to paraphrase  Whoever had that quote  Yeah  Opportunity knocks  And it's dressed up as hard work  But you know and like  So it never comes down to one thing  And also a lot of those breaks  Were Trojan horsing  Huge disasters  You just didn't see them  You're like yes  Here we go  Yeah  Oh my god why did I say yes to that  Yes  And then something that you did  Almost as okay  Like I mean  Again I always use the example of  Marc Maron who  Had all these big moments 
[03:27:30]  And then the thing that  He just went  I'm just going out to my fucking garage  And talking  And that was  That blew it all open  You know so you just never know  I understand completely  And I do get  And I forget who I just had this conversation with  Was  Oh it was Eddie Ift  He goes  Bring comedy down to a competition  Five minutes a piece  It's just not fair  And I can speak from experience  And you and I have both been headlining for a very long time  You and I are the reason that people are in a theater 
[03:28:00]  I know  Like there's 1,200 people  Yeah  Just to see you or just to see me  Yeah  And if we had to battle that fan for five minutes  We'd get blown off the stage  Oh my god  I beat you  I don't have five minutes  No  That's the thing that I say  And by the way  That is in a very sick way  One aspect of Last Comic Standing  Which is you go in front of three judges  Three random judges  And they decide the next step of your career  In a very sick way  That is a very accurate depiction of how show business works 
[03:28:30]  If you ever pitch a TV show  Pitch a TV show  Or audition for something  You're suddenly you've driven out to Venice  And you're full of Dayquil  And someone that you're auditioning for  Is getting angry texts from a teacher at their school  So everything's going against you  And that is deciding  It all comes down to one audition  It all comes down  So sometimes it does come down to that five minutes  Especially on an audition  Yes  You don't get more than five minutes in a room  When you did Biggest Fan  Was that an offer?  Or did you have to go in and earn it?  That, thank god, was an offer 
[03:29:00]  Because  You were great in that room  If I had had to audition for that  Based on who else wanted it  There were some other people who really wanted it  And if I had had to go up against them  There's no way in hell I would have gotten it  But for some reason  For some  I still don't know why  And I owe him  Forever  Robert Siegel was like  I want this guy  It was great  Despite these other people  That wanted it  They couldn't make it  And talk about other people  I auditioned for the Charlize Theron movie  Young Adults  You did? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, to be the guy that  The guy that she's trying to win back  No kidding  And then I like the script so much  Is it called Young Adult?  Young Adult  Young Adult  And I like the script so much  That I told the director  I said  I'll be the guy in the wheelchair  That just screams in the bar  He has three lines  And he goes  Yeah!  Oh yeah, that guy!  Like a super aggressive wheelchair guy  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  I can do anything man  He's doing  Like I'll do anything in this movie  Yeah  Because I love this script so much  And it didn't work out 
[03:30:00]  But I know  When I went in  They were like  Charlize Theron, Philip Seymour Hoffman  We're all ready to go  And then when the movie came out  It was you  And I remember watching the movie  And it was  I think way better  Because you gave it a lot more heart  And it was like  You were a real guy  Thank you  And when you guys finally like  Laid on top of each other  And you were like mortified  And she was  That leg  Yeah, that little crippled leg  I didn't see that coming  I did not know  I mean they did a cast of my leg  But they do it with that  This blue gel  And they put dots on it  So they can animate it  So I wasn't expecting that 
[03:30:30]  When I saw the first screening of it  Oh, so when you did the scene  They didn't tell you  You were going to have  Like a little tiny mangled leg  Oh, they told me the leg would be messed up  But they drew these huge dots on my leg  Yeah  That would be used for  It was like a baby leg  Yeah, it was all of them  Sounds funny to say that  Just say baby leg  Baby leg  Enjoy it  But going back to Top Chef  Top Chef  I did some event in Brooklyn  And I talked to  Tom Caliccio was there  And he talked to me  He had no reason to talk to me  And I was like  Hey, I love Top Chef  He was on  And he talked to me for like an hour about it  And he said the one thing he hated 
[03:31:00]  About the early seasons of Top Chef  And they've gotten rid of that now  And the reason he hated it  Was because it was unfair  To people viewing  And to young chefs coming up  Is they  In the early seasons  They wanted a mix of  This guy trained at the Boku's door  And she's a caterer from Long Island  It's anybody's game on Top Chef  He's like, no, it's not anybody's game  That's unfair  She, the caterer from Long Island  Cooks amazing food, I'm sure  And could become a great chef someday  But a guy with that level of training  Against her 
[03:31:30]  It's gonna  She's going to end up being crushed  Yeah, because she has to put out  40 Cornish game hens  Exactly  And it's gonna mess  For a ladies' golf luncheon  Yeah, exactly  And it's gonna  It's gonna  Scare a lot of people off  From becoming chefs  Because people do  Or a guy who is right now  A line cook  At like  Le Hall  Is going up  The  Going up against  The sous chef  At Providence  That's more fair  Well, actually that isn't  Fair either  Because the sous chef  Has had to 
[03:32:00]  Plan menus  And knows how to improvise  And this person just  Does recipes  So he's like  Just have it be professionals  You know  Have it be people  That was a big blowback  On Last Comic Standing  Was people were saying like  Well that guy's been on  Comedy Central before  And I remember  Pre-Twitter  When people would  Email you on like  Your website  And saying  This is baloney  No one ever said  This is an amateur comedy competition  Right  And if Alonzo Bowden  Has been doing comedy for 18 years  And he's been on Comedy Central  And had a special  That's  No one ever said 
[03:32:30]  This is an amateur comedy competition  Right  Although it would be interesting  If it was more curated  Like  Not to toot my own horn  But  I did  Comedians of Comedy  Was not only  A to get myself  More exposure  But I'm a huge  Fan of comedy  And I get  As frustrated as I get  With my career  I get frustrated  When I see people  Who I think are brilliant  And are not being  Showcased  Correctly  Yeah  At the time  I just thought that  Zach and Maria  And Brian were so  Brilliant 
[03:33:00]  And original  And they just  Brian was kind of being  Pigeon-holed  I thought  Brian Pussain  Yeah I'm sorry  Brian Pussain, Maria Bamford, Zach Galifianakis  And  Zach who now?  I hope I'm saying this right  Zach Galifianakis  I've heard of Seth  I don't know Zach  Okay yeah  Zach's  He's on YouTube  He's really funny  He's got a couple videos up  But he  Yeah they  I just was so frustrated  With  These people are so brilliant  Why aren't they being  Looked at  Not that I'm the reason  Those guys broke 
[03:33:30]  They broke on their own  But I was just  If I can do anything  To have people  Yeah  Look at them more  And Maria  You know just  Became  Now has this  Insane cult  Following  Of  She's just so beloved  But at the time  She would talk about  She would do these shows  And people  Then not only would they  Heckle her  Like a woman  She talks about it in the special  But that woman got up  I'm so sick of your voices  Is everyone else here  Just sick of this  And the whole crowd  Like got up and walked out  It was 
[03:34:00]  Cause she was so original  And it  So it just  So I wanted to keep them away  From shows like  Last Comic  No offense  No no  Cause those would not be  The right showcase for them  That's correct  And again talk about comics  Who's  A dog whistle  Oh  Like Maria Bamford  Is so brilliant  At times  I don't like  People  I have no idea  What a regular voice is like  Even when she's talking regularly  Yeah  To you off camera  Yeah  I don't know if she's putting you on  Yeah  It's like Kaufman-esque 
[03:34:30]  Like she goes down this rabbit hole of voices  That even when she comes up for air  You're like  Is this the real Maria Bamford voice?  Or maybe she doesn't know anymore  I don't know anymore  All I know is that  Near the end of the tour  When  You know we have like guests come on  And our friends  Wherever city we're in  So  We're  Howard Kramer  Doug Benson  Brian Posehn  Me  Maria  Zach  We're at the  Independent and SF  And  So I go up and start up  And Doug and Brian and Howard  And Zach  Are back having  Smoking weed  In back of the club 
[03:35:00]  Having a little pot break  And then Maria goes on  And I went back and went  Hey Maria's  I go Maria's on  And then it'll be Doug  And when they heard Maria's on  They all stopped smoking weed  And ran out to watch her  I was like  That's the sign of a great comedian  When the guys  When the comedians who go smoke weed  Are like I'll smoke this later  I'm gonna go watch what she does  Yeah  And they all ran out to watch her  I was like okay good  This is  Cause just cause  I remember if you were from high school  We thought you were some kind of lesbo  Or something  That whole story  And that whole story  We  Brian and I kept saying  That must be an actual person  That is so specific 
[03:35:30]  She goes no I just made it all up  Really?  I thought they were all real people  But it's based on  The people that she knew  Growing up  And she creates  New characters  That sound even realer  Than the real people  She had to deal with  Like the boss lady  Giving the tour of the office  And it's all kind of crazy here  We do things differently here  And we do things a little different here  See you at the quickening  And she  And she  Said she based that  On at least  50 orientations  She had to go through  As a temp  It was an incredible bit  And she's the only one 
[03:36:00]  That does it  To that rhythm  Like I think any comic  Would have done like  Really?  And then like done like  Set up punchline  Set up punchline  Yeah yeah yeah  What's different?  On Tuesdays we wear hats  Like the exasperated  Like what's different about it?  Right right  And like how come it's not  And then she just actually  Goes into like  Rip in the space time continuum  Yeah  She's the one comedian  That I say  That she never has to worry  About being stolen from  You cannot make that stuff work  You can't do it  And her stuff 
[03:36:30]  Is so brilliant  And anyone else trying to do it  It would not  They could not deliver that  So I appreciate this conversation  About Last Comic Standing  And there is  It's a very viable argument  That you have  That it comes down to  Five minutes  And someone is  A discernible loser  Yeah  And that's not fair to a comic  Well it's all  It's not only is it not fair to a comic  It's not fair to what we do  Because it is not what we do  Because part of what we do  Is going up and failing  Along the way  And that should be embraced  And celebrated 
[03:37:00]  Not gone like  Well you fucked up  That's it  You know  I've had just as much fun  And I'm sure you did too  At open mics  Those nights when  You come off and you're like  Wow I just  I completely fucking flamed out  That was  It was exhilarating  And it was exhilarating  To go through that  And then go  I don't think I'm gonna be  As scared tomorrow night  Because it can't be  Any worse than what  Like it's this weird freedom  Of hey  And again  On a meta textual level  Maybe 
[03:37:30]  Flaming out on national TV  Gives people  Even bigger courage  Maybe  For all we know  Last Comic Standing  Is gonna create a generation  Of even more fearless comics  I don't know  But I don't  Like it  Cut and edited  Down to that idea  Do you think  The guys that are flame  I don't know  If they're flaming out  When they get to that  When it comes down to  Ten  Well the final ten  Just like on  On American Idol  That's a different thing  I just don't like the initial  And I really didn't like  The beginning 
[03:38:00]  When they aped  That American Idol  Horrible model of  Let's put the freaks out here  And make fun of them  The people that have  No business being up here  Well then  Don't film them  Why is a guy in a banana suit  Standing in line  On Melrose Boulevard  For eight hours  If you're not gonna  If you were the executive producer  Of the show  Aren't you gonna say  There's a guy in a banana suit  Outside  I know  I'm asking you honestly  No no  Honestly  If I was  Well  You own 25% of last comic standing  You're the executive producer  There's a guy in a banana suit  Three blocks away 
[03:38:30]  In a four block line  I would try to  I would try to film him  And talk to him  As a human being  And not do what they do  On American Idol  Which is  They just have them  Walk out cold  And go whoa  Look at this freak  Like William Hung  She bang  Bob and Ross were real nice  They're nice guys  No they are nice  And the guy in the banana suit  In all fairness  How often has that guy  Ever been on television  The one time  And right when he said  You might be wondering  Why I'm dressed as a banana  And Ross goes  That's enough 
[03:39:00]  We've seen enough  And Bob goes  He was just gonna tell us  Why he's in the banana suit  That was the whole payoff  And you cut him off  Yeah I just  I don't  I don't know  I just  I don't like  I don't  I'm not entertained  By other people's desperation  I'm not either  And being lost  I don't  I'm not entertained  By the lost  And the broken  Just after a while  Unless they're being treated  As humans  And not  Like the circus geek  The guy that they give  A bottle of gin to everyday  So that he'll bite  The heads off chickens 
[03:39:30]  I'd actually like to  Sober him up  And how did you get to be  What happened to you  Why are you down here  Rather than just watch the geek show  Like maybe help him  I think you and I should pitch this show  What the circus  I'm not kidding  The real circus geeks  Or like the people that do those  I think that's already up and running on Bravo  But the actual like stuntman crazy people  Sideshow people  Like the sad people  Like the guy that dresses up as Darth Vader on Hollywood Boulevard  Like who  My friend Clota  She's got a great expression that her mom used to say 
[03:40:00]  They're from Ireland  She goes who's he when he's at home  No that is true though  Who is he though  Look at him who's he when he's at home  Like who is the guy that dresses up as Spongebob  When he gets home  He gets home  Like what happens in that apartment  Like what was 9  What was 9-11 like for him  The Spongebob guy  What did  I mean and I'm not saying to be funny  What  What happened that morning when he saw the planes at the buildings  Was he do I put the costume on  Do I go out what do I do  I think he probably put the costume on  When I don't think he made as much money  Yeah I need to go comfort people 
[03:40:30]  But yeah I do think that's that  Like that's a show I would watch too  And I don't know if anybody's really given it a run  Because you know networks  It's a lot like socialism  In theory it's great  But socialism fails eventually  Because human beings are involved  Yeah I know  And eventually you have a network executive going  That guy's such a freak  Make sure you get  Okay let me tell you how  Well that's okay my before  Long before I met her  And before he was ever the bachelor  My wife briefly dated the very first guy that was on the bachelor 
[03:41:00]  Way before he was ever the bachelor  And then the bachelor  Then years later  They're still friends  And he and the bachelor  And he was telling her that  The producers would after every show would sit down and go  Okay I know these  I know you're not going to hook up with these two girls  But they're insane  And we've got to keep them around here  Because it's great TV  And it's you know  Keep the damaged broken people here for our entertainment  And that's just not  Well I can speak from experience  That definitely never happened  On Last Comic Standing  Are you sure?  Really?  Yes  You weren't keeping the freaks around just to 
[03:41:30]  The audition process  I'm completely not involved with  Right  And when those people line up  They go up and they audition for all different people  And then  What the biggest  Quote on  No controversy  What people think was controversy  Was when it was Drew Carey  Brett Butler  Yeah  I had to admit that screwed over  But people don't understand  I had Dan  I don't vote  Barry Katz is not allowed to vote  Yeah  That's the other thing is they go  Barry Katz rigs it for his clients  Well then Burt Kreischer would have won  Gary Goleman would have won  Right  There would have been a whole bunch of people that were his clients 
[03:42:00]  That would have won  They would have just been pushed through  Mm-hmm  But I had my ten people on a piece of paper  Yeah  And I compare notes with the network executives  Right  And I had two girls and eight guys  Mm-hmm  And when I handed in my note  It was Lorne Michaels-esque  And Jim Downey-esque  Where they looked at my note  And just pushed it right back  And said  You gotta have three girls  And I said  Well three girls didn't  Weren't  They didn't earn it  There's not  They go well  Female demographic in the audience  You have to have three women in the house  Right 
[03:42:30]  Right  So someone has to come off the list  Now I made one underline on my list  And that was Jay London  And I said  If Jay London  Is not on this list of the ten  I'm not going out to announce who the winner is  Because he got a standing ovation  Yeah  He's a Neanderthal  He drives a cab in Queens  And this is a life-changing thing for him  And also more than anyone on that show that first season  He truly loves stand-up  Yeah  He absolutely loves doing stand-up 
[03:43:00]  And he actually is joyful doing it  And he earned it  Yeah  I was like  Out of all the guys  Like Gary Goleman's gonna be fine  Right  And everyone else  You know  Those guys are going to be okay  But Jay London got a standing ovation  At the Paris Day Arts Theatre  Right  At the Paris Hotel and Casino  And I remember I underlined his name  And I was like  I don't know if this is my place  But I gotta tell the powers that be  If his name's not on the ten  I'm not walking back out on stage  Right  That was my quote-unquote justice  Right 
[03:43:30]  Yeah  That was why I was the executive producer  To make sure this guy didn't get jobbed  But when I handed my list of ten  I gotta take somebody off  Everybody's gotta take off a guy  Because the network  Honchos  Plural  Say you must have three women  And then the immediate battle cry back is  But three women didn't earn their way into the house  It's not up for debate  Right  Someone's gotta come off  Natterman was that guy  And then Drew Carey  And Brett Butler  Who were not backstage in this process  I didn't see that  They just think  You completely ignored our notes  They should have been backstage 
[03:44:00]  In the process  And then people  Watching  And comics  Especially  Go  Well this is fixed  This is fixed  You can't  I cannot emphasize this enough  For the listener  You can't  Fix an audition  Right  It's an audition to get into the house  To enter the competition  Right  You are auditioning  To be on Last Comic Standing at that point  Once they're in the house  Patton Oswalt  We had to videotape  And film  The coin toss 
[03:44:30]  To see who went on first  Three separate ways  Because of the quiz show scandals  They had it  Air tight  You couldn't  Possibly cheat  Right  You couldn't rig it whatsoever  And people texting  Phone call  And guess what  That fan  Right  People texted their eyes out  To get this guy ahead of Ralphie Mae  I'm not saying that the competition itself was rigged  I just object to its existence  To the  The format  That is what  That is what drove me crazy  And what you went through backstage  Is that  That drives me crazy  Where it's 
[03:45:00]  No matter  No matter the quality  You have to have  You know  This  This  Where's your  White, black, male, female  Yeah and that  Oh that was the other thing  Need two black guys  That's the same kind of thing  Two black guys, three women  Hold on  So two black guys  Three women  Now we have five comics  And a quota system  And now we're giving it to five comics  That have earned it  Right  Instead of ten comics  That have earned it  We've been cut in half  And if I  It drives me crazy  If I ran a network  And that's 
[03:45:30]  That was my marching orders  From the person in the desk  Right above mine  That's what I would do too  But this is great  This is so much  You can't explain this  In a tweet  Yeah exactly  When people go like  It's fixed  Why don't you guys talk about  How all Barry Katz's clients  How they all got development deals  Right  And this and that  And they didn't let Barry anywhere near it  Barry could ruin toast  Barry's a card carrying moron  I don't want him in the room  I mean he's a nice guy  He's been my manager forever  But for crying out loud  Yeah  He's the last guy you want 
[03:46:00]  I really think that guy  Had something undeniable  That's the thing about Patton man  Once he was ratatouille  He was a game over man  What?  Oh boy  I've just made all that up  Yeah no  But boy that sounded accurate  Oh my god  Oh I thought you were saying  What like Barry said that about him?  Game over  No that just sounds  Game over man  Patton's one of those guys  He's undeniable  But that same quota system  Led to all the stupidity  In the 80's  Of can't have three women  Can't have three women  On a comedy show 
[03:46:30]  Because  No if they're really fucking funny  Trust me after five  No one gives a shit  As long as the acts are great  You know  Or you can't have like three black guys  And then you can have an all black crowd  I don't give a shit  I just want  I want a crowd  I just want the three funniest  Well as an audience  They're like  I just love how they would speak  For the audience  I also  And trust me  The audience wants the three funniest people you can get  They don't give a shit  I also like the idea  That if you have three black comics on a flyer  Suddenly the black community comes out of the woodwork  Yeah  Like woo 
[03:47:00]  Now they're going to come out of  It's going to be filled with black people  We can't have that  Yeah  God forbid you fill your room with people of color  Yeah  That are card carrying  Members of the audience  Yeah but also  They also think that  The average white person will go  Three black people  There's nothing there for me to listen to  Well no  It's  Why don't you cultivate crowds that just like comedy  Yeah  I don't give a shit  I don't give a shit  I would rather watch  If there was a show that had  Dave Chappelle 
[03:47:30]  And Chris Rock  And then they were going to have like Tony Woods  Or Wanda Sykes there  I wouldn't be  Yeah I wouldn't be in there going  God I just  I don't even care if he's not funny  I just wish there was a white guy here  Have you ever played a prison?  No  And I  Although I am  On Thursday the 11th of December  I am doing the private  LAPD robbery homicide Christmas party  Yes  Which I did last year  And it was a fucking blast  Because it's a  You  Go up  Do like half an hour 
[03:48:00]  And then you drink with these guys  And they  Get wasted  And they tell you shit  That you cannot  And they just keep giving you like  Those little  Did you ever get one of those tiny badges  To hang in your car?  Uh  I haven't got one of those yet  I actually kind of  Just ask them  Just ask them straight up like  Can I get one of those badges for my wallet?  It's like a little tiny  It's like a thumbnail sized badge  It means like  Your brother's a cop  Really?  Yeah  Hasn't gotten me out of anything  Yeah okay  Hasn't your brother's a cop?  No but somebody gave me one  Oh really?  And when I've been pulled over  They go where'd you get the badge?  I go my brother  And I gotta go midtown north 
[03:48:30]  They asked my size for a robbery homicide jacket  Like one of their special teams jackets  Patton Oswalt  Robbery homicide man  Well my wife is a true crime writer  So I do it A for my own amusement  Wait so your wife was on The Bachelor season one?  No no no no no  No  But she dated The Bachelor  Before he was The Bachelor  Way before he was ever The Bachelor  Okay  This was like  He was a totally successful  Like you know  Harvard educated  Brilliant  Like with money  And stuff like that  Okay so your wife was never on The Bachelor  Oh god  And she's a true crime writer  She writes about cold cases 
[03:49:00]  And is writing a book right now  For Harper Collins  But it's like that is her Christmas  Going to the robbery homicide party  Because talking to all these guys  And they you know  She knows stuff that they don't know  Because she investigates stuff  With the internet  And cops  Most police forces  They just don't embrace the internet yet  So she goes  You know this guy posted  The guy you're looking for  You know he has a Tumblr account  Is writing about  Sweetheart  I don't want to get your panties in a bunch  But here we go by our guts 
[03:49:30]  No it literally is like that  Like we look  We go knock on doors  And they  And you know  The crime she's investigating now  She has all these  Police files from the 70s  And she looks  She gets to read how they would  Do crime  And it was literally  There are persons of interest  And knocked on doors  Subject not home  And that's where the trail ends  That's where it ends  We knocked on his door  What else are we supposed to do  I don't care about you  What am I Kreskin?  How do I find him?  I don't care about your face space  We got something here called a hunch  Right  That's real cute 
[03:50:00]  You got your little laptop  And I bet you got a little  Hello Kitty sticker on it  That's real nice  And you post your kitten photos  And that's fine  But honey  Yeah  I got his gut  And it's telling me  You're barking up the wrong tree  The part of my gut  That's not filled with doers  Is telling me  That this guy  But the  And these guys  Like the stories they have  Of how they  Track these dudes down  Or just  I mean  They're amazing  It's a fascinating world  Everyone  You know  The personal rights 
[03:50:30]  That we give up  Because of all the security cameras  But like  The amount of crimes  That are solved  Just because there's  A camera in a parking lot  And you see somebody  Getting in a car  From 500 feet away  Yeah  And that guy gets arrested  Do you think that's a fair trade off?  Well it depends  I mean again  Assuming they're not watching you masturbate  I'm a little  I'm torn because  The idea of a surveillance state  Is a little creepy to me  But at the same time  But part of me  The bad part of me says  Wait a minute  I don't do any weird stuff  So I don't care  Like film the weirdos 
[03:51:00]  It's like  There's part of you  It's like the Chris Rock thing  Of the people that are worried  About the bullets  The cops using  The people that are  Probably going to get shot  For doing something wrong  Like those are the people  That are making all the noise  But I  You know  And by the way  I also love how  Everyone's squawking about  Losing their privacy  And yet  We're the most  Exhibitionist  Show everything  About ourselves  If Big Brother  From 1984  Existed today  He would get on  Instead of the two minute hate  He would come out and go  I don't need to see 
[03:51:30]  Pictures of everyone's  Ball sacks  Okay please  Yeah  If you could just  The camera that we put  In your apartment  That's all we need  Yeah  Don't send in any extras  I don't need pictures  Of your food  Yeah stop filming  Your buttholes  And your ball sacks  And your food  And your fucking cats  I don't give a shit  I just  You know what  I'm shutting all the camera  I can't take this  You people are animals  You are fucking animals  I hate all of you  Like you would not  You would not want to be  Looking at that  So  You have bawled  At everybody's selfies  But 
[03:52:00]  This is me in a field  What's really  What's really weird is  For all of the  Oh there's so much more  Surveillance  So much more technology  Yes  But the people  Doing the surveilling  Are  Have not caught up  With  What  A 13 year old  Can do  With  Their camera  And their Facebook  And  You know  And chat roulette  They  A 13 year old  Is actually more  Wired in  As to what cameras  To look at  Than most cops  Because  Cops are like  I don't need to go  In the gun  I go out  And I  Interview subjects  That's what  You know  There's a generation 
[03:52:30]  That sort of  Needs to die off  And the hacker generation  Needs to come up  As cops  They just don't  Believe in it  Yeah  Is it pride  Is it like  They just don't  Want to give in  To the fact  That there's  Something better  Than their gut  And their hunch  No I mean  Look  It takes  Why don't you  Like cops  It takes  I fucking love  Cops  I don't know  Anyone who says  That they hate  Cops  Are people  That are trying  To act like  They're bad ass  It's like  Man I fucking  Man I fucking  Hate cops  Trust me  The minute  Matty boy  Yeah  The minute  Someone stole  Your iPod 
[03:53:00]  You go crying  To the cops  Don't tell me  How bad ass  Rebel you are  Sorry Matty  But  The  All that  Hunch stuff  That still took  A decade of  Hardcore training  To learn  And now  They're being  Asked to learn  An entirely  New world  They're like  I don't have  Enough time  I'm not  The reason  I didn't get  What's the program  To write a script  On your computer  Final draft  The reason  I didn't get  Final draft 
[03:53:30]  Is because  It's like  Anything computer  It's like  Learning a new  Language  I'm 43 years old  And I'm like  I'm not gonna learn  I'll just write it out  Longhand  I don't know  What I'm doing  And it scares me  Yeah  Like literally  And people go like  Have you tried  Like Facebook  I go  Hey did you tag  Like one question  Do you want it to be tagged  And I go  I don't know what that means  Never went back to Facebook again  Has your wife ever gotten  Any reward money  For solving these crimes  No I mean  She puts them together  She's not doing it  For the role  She likes to solve the puzzle  And also  A lot of times  Don't you want a second car 
[03:54:00]  But there's  Well  Trust me  The book sales  Atta boy  But she  A lot of these  They're cold cases  There's no reward  They've been dead  For 10-20 years  The people  Or the cases  The cases  And sometimes  Sometimes the people  Sometimes the people  Involved  And that's  You know  That's  You know  The weird way  That we're  At this intersection  Where everything  Is changing over  In such a gigantic way  I don't think  This has happened  Since the switch over  From agrarian  To industrial 
[03:54:30]  At the turn of the century  Where there are  Some people  That are going to  Be fine with it  And other people  Are just going to  You're going to  Be left behind  Do you think  Go ahead  No no  It's that thing  And I know  That in about  10 or 20 years  There'll be some  Technology that's  Going to come along  That I will  Finally hit the wall  Where I'll be like  I'm not jumping  On board with this  Yeah I'm not doing  Google Plus  Yeah  Yeah I'm  You got invited  On LinkedIn  I'm like first of all  How did you get  My email address  Second of all  I've never heard  Of the person  Inviting me to LinkedIn  Yeah  Third of all  I don't know  What LinkedIn is 
[03:55:00]  If you were to use  The chain LinkedIn fence  I use Twitter  Because Twitter's great  It's so easy  And I like Facebook  Because I have  A private account  Under a fake name  For just me and my friends  Really  Oh the shit  We write about you Jay  And then  But then  But I realized  If I were to do  All of these platforms  Tumblr  Instagram  That would be  A second career  To maintain all of those  I tapped out of Instagram  Because I realized  It's all pictures  Of my family  And I realized  Well that's private  Yeah I don't want 
[03:55:30]  People looking at that  I have a two year old  I don't want anybody  To leave a negative comment  About my two year old  There is a  I went to the  I got invited to the  Winnie the Pooh premiere  And my daughter  At the time was two  And so she goes  I want to go see  Winnie the Pooh  And they had the whole  Disney lot made up  To look like the  You know the forest  Christopher Robin's forest  Wow  And they said  Well you enter in through there  Like there's the big entrance  So I had her under my arm  And they didn't tell me  That that's where  That was the camera line  So now there's all these  Pictures online of me 
[03:56:00]  And I  I have the  I didn't want to be like  On camera like  Screaming at people  Like don't  But I don't want them  Taking pictures  You could have also  Walked backwards  It was like  I had already  The way  I swear to God  They had done it  It looked like this little  Woodsy opening  So you go through  And then you can't  You don't realize  What's on the other side  Then you go through  And now you're stuck  And there's people behind you  Can you please  You know like  We are through the looking glass  People  All these other celebrities  Are moving along  With their kids  Like let's all just  And they all want to  Get out of the way too 
[03:56:30]  Like I don't want to  But there are pictures  Of me with my daughter  And I have the  Tensest smile on my face  Like if someone  I'm going to murder somebody  How dare  And then your wife  Would have to crack that case  And then she'd have to  Yeah I would have killed someone  Would you be able to  Hide a murder  From your wife  There's no  When I see now  What these  Online sleuths can do  Just fuck  Fuck all that DNA  CSI stuff  Which is all bullshit anyway  If you go to an actual  Police crime lab  The CSI crime lab  Looks like  It looks like  The sports book 
[03:57:00]  In Vegas  With all those  Liquid screens  On the TVs  The actual sports lab  The actual crime lab  Marshall thundering herd  Minus five  On the rape  It's crazy  But crime labs  Police  It's like a closet  And then  If you ever watch  There's that great scene  In the wire  Where it's like  Hey can you run this  Blood sample for me  Because it's really crucial  He goes  Yeah do you have $500  Like we send it out  I don't have  You kidding  I gotta pay for this shit  Yeah it takes like  Three months  On the TV show  It's the commercial break  Yeah  Or as they say  Can you enhance that 
[03:57:30]  Can you enhance that  Enhance it  Oh that's  Yeah I like when they  Did the facial recognition  Software  And one second  A guy walks across  The street in Altadena  And they're like  Oh that's Patton Oswalt  Yeah  From the helicopter  In space  The CSI stuff  Doesn't scare me  But the online digital stuff  You have left  An electronic trail  Whether you know it or not  Oh I'm sure I know it  And they'll find you  Well I won't do anything wrong  There you go  I'm a happily married man  Mr. Garrison  Do you  How much  When you talk about  The changing over 
[03:58:00]  To the industrial revolution  I think comedy now  When I watch like  Comedy central specials  Those half hours  Yeah yeah  I think those  Are more disruptive  You want to talk about  People getting a half hour  Yes  I absolutely agree  For the listener  If the person's name  Is behind them  In the special  They probably  Shouldn't have a special  Right  If the curtain says  You know  Michael McGillicuddy  In a cool fashion  In a font  Yeah yeah  You should know 
[03:58:30]  As soon as they walk on stage  It should  I think  Stan  And I'm not saying  These guys shouldn't do  Their specials  But if you're going  To do a special  I think it should be  Appointment viewing  If I go to Epics  And I watch Patton Oswalt  Which I will  It's because  I love watching  Patton Oswalt  Do stand up comedy  It's never like  Who's this guy  I don't know  What's it say  In the backdrop  Behind them  That way I'll never  Forget his name  I just  What I  What I don't like  Is  Again  It's the  They're grabbing  These people  Too early  Like  Just 
[03:59:00]  For God's sakes  Leave them alone  Leave them alone  Let them develop  Let them work  Let them work  For a little bit  I mean  They're  They're all working  If they're at the point  Where they can have  A half hour special  Then they're doing fine  Financially  They can put out albums  Whenever they want to  On there  And they can build  Something much closer  To their actual voice  Rather than  Suddenly  They're in this  Giant theater  That's way bigger  Than any place  They've ever done before  When I did my first  Half hour for  HBO  I was gobsmacked  I was not  I don't know 
[03:59:30]  If I was really ready  But I wanted it  So badly  Here's what's fascinating  About the whole process  That we're talking about  I'm pretty sure  You  Me  And any  Headliner in the United States  If Comedy Central  Instead of like having  Five half hours  They said  We'll give you  Two separate hours  Can you do an hour  This year  And an hour a year  For now  We would absolutely  Do it  Exactly  So what the networks  Don't understand  Is you don't have to  Piecemeal a half hour  Of middle acts  Right  To America </pre>
