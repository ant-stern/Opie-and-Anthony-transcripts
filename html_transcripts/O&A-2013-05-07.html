<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, making crude and boastful remarks and joking, insensitively, about co-host Sam's illness and the absence of Sam and Sal.  They then expressed frustration with SiriusXM's communication and technical difficulties regarding their show's on-demand and Audible accessibility following an upcoming channel change.

The show subsequently turned to a detailed discussion of the Cleveland kidnapping case, focusing on the victims' ages at the time of abduction and their current emotional state.  The hosts offered graphic descriptions of the captors' actions, speculating on their motives and mentioning similar cases involving Joseph Fritzl and Randy Kraft, again with graphic details. They also speculated about potential further discoveries in the Cleveland case and discussed similar instances of prolonged captivity.  Audio of Amanda Berry's 911 call was played, with the hosts criticizing the operator's perceived lack of urgency.  They then played an interview with Charles Ramsey, highlighting his seemingly nonchalant and humorous account of assisting Berry's escape, and speculated about Ramsey's potential legal issues stemming from his interview.

The show featured an interview with Buzz Aldrin, promoting his book, *Mission to Mars*.  Aldrin discussed his vision for a permanent human presence on Mars, the technological and political challenges involved, and speculated on extraterrestrial life and UFO sightings. A humorous moment involved Aldrin's reluctance to sign Jimmy Norton's book cover, preferring to sign inside, and his repeated urging for the hosts to "not dilly-dally." The hosts commented on Aldrin’s "grouchy" demeanor and jewelry.  Following the interview, the hosts further discussed Aldrin's personality and their interactions with him, focusing on his perceived curmudgeonliness and autograph refusal.

Returning to the Cleveland case, the hosts played and compared excerpts from two of Charles Ramsey's interviews, noting discrepancies and joking about his evolving story and unexpected rise to fame.  They also played Ramsey's unedited, profanity-laced 911 call.  The conversation briefly touched upon Governor Chris Christie's lap band surgery and Led Zeppelin's refusal to reunite.

A call-in segment followed, featuring Dr. Steve Chipperson answering listener questions about unusually large scrotums, with callers detailing various scrotal issues and the conversation punctuated by profanity and sexually suggestive humor. This was followed by an in-studio appearance by four original MTV VJs: Mark Goodman, Martha Quinn, Nina Blackwood, and Alan Hunter. The hosts discussed their book and reminisced about their MTV days, focusing significantly on obtaining photos with the VJs.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Tourette's Syndrome, sparked by a story about Michael Doyle, who was denied boarding on a JetBlue flight for repeatedly yelling "bomb." The hosts and callers engaged in a series of jokes and anecdotes about Tourette's, frequently using extremely offensive language, including racial slurs and misogynistic terms. They debated whether Doyle's actions were genuinely caused by his Tourette's or posed a safety risk, referencing the Boston Marathon bombing. The segment included several calls from listeners with their own experiences or stories about individuals with Tourette's, often with humorous and offensive descriptions of tics.  Several clips of "classic" black eyewitness news reports were played, featuring humorous and sometimes incoherent descriptions of various incidents.  A clip featuring Antoine Dodson was also shown, along with discussion of his later announcement about no longer identifying as homosexual.  The show concluded with advertisements for Steven Singer Jewelers and Pajamagram, interspersed with further discussion and a live interview with Steve Percy, author of "Sex, Drugs, Rat and Roll: My Life in Rock." Percy shared stories from his time in the 80s rock scene, including experiences with substance abuse and the excesses of the rock and roll lifestyle.  He also discussed his band Rat, touching on maintaining momentum, the toll of touring, releasing new music, their relationship with critics, and rumors surrounding lead singers' stage presence. The interview concluded with details about upcoming book signings and Rat shows, punctuated by expletives and humorous anecdotes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little.  What?  He did dang over here.  Don't listen to dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, God damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, Lord have mercy. 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  How is everybody?  Oh.  Look, the gang's all back together again.  Not really.  Sam's out.  Sal's out.  Oh, that's right.  Fucking Manny.  Sal.  Where's Sam?  Sam's a sick boy.  What?  Can't keep anything down.  Is he vomiting?  Yeah, the image of Sam.  Puking and shitting himself.  Makes me very happy. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, that's how he makes everybody else feel.  It makes me very happy.  Oh, man.  I bet you his mommy is rubbing his tummy somewhere.  Think he's got food poisoning or his stomach?  That's what I asked him.  I don't know.  I bet he...  How could he have food poisoning if he doesn't eat much?  Maybe some bad fish sticks.  How do you get bad chicken nuggets?  Yeah.  He'd have to be sick if he's going to take a day off, because you know how he likes doing  that after show.  He loves it.  If it was Wednesday, I'd say it was bullshitting, because Jimmy's got his show. 
[00:02:00]  Well, I guess E-Rock has to do the after show today.  Oh, boy.  You're planning on it, right, E-Rock?  No.  Which incarnation of the 405 E-Rock shows?  Well, we're two days away from the channel change.  Oh, right.  I guarantee that will be a clusterfuck.  Yeah.  Thursday, we move the whole operation to another channel.  What channel?  103.  103.  Okay. 
[00:02:30]  103.  I can't keep tracking on it.  Yeah.  For those who have it, but then they're saying they will have it, but I'm saying they're not  going to have it, or some of them will not have it.  And the thing is, it doesn't matter what the reality is, they're being told all kinds  of mixed messages.  Because they just read off scripts when you call it SXM help, or whatever the fuck it  is.  And they love blaming the show.  Yeah, yeah, they blame the show.  Everything that goes wrong, it's the show's problem.  Oh, yeah, there was one tweet that came in over the weekend.  That's good.  They're telling us you guys decided blah, blah, wasn't supposed to happen. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, so fucking assholes, here's what I heard.  Right.  They told us that you guys decided to do that.  No.  What was that?  I forgot.  There was, somebody told them that they didn't know of us moving to 103, so he sent them  the documentation, and they wrote back, oh, you are right, we haven't updated our files,  so they didn't even know that we were moving.  Yeah.  Why pay, like, a help service, or whatever? 
[00:03:30]  Someone said, we decided to be on two separate platforms.  Oh, right, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it was.  We decided.  No, we didn't.  Yeah.  Yesterday they wrote me on Twitter telling me about our on-demand being down.  And I said, I work here, I know.  Yeah, it was another one, yeah.  Supposedly they're fixing that.  I don't know.  It's, um, that's a company-wide problem, it's just, uh.  And Audible, too.  And Audible's down.  What's wrong with that?  What happened?  Meteor?  Meteor hit one of the satellites?  What happened?  I don't know.  It's fucking in space. 
[00:04:00]  God, if we have.  Our whole career depends on two or three things that are flying in space.  Just zooming along, right?  Holy shit.  Constantly falling?  Yeah.  Technically, they're constantly falling, right?  Yes, they're in orbit, so they're constantly falling.  Falling around the planet.  It's just amazing, because if something goes wrong with, like, you know, something here  on Earth, you're like, oh boy, they'd better get a repair person down at the transmitter  or something.  And they usually do it.  Yeah.  But it's like, oh, something wrong with the satellite?  Oh boy.  Well, that's it. 
[00:04:30]  The company's over.  Remember how long it took to fix the Hubble?  Yeah, yeah.  The Hubble.  I don't know.  So there's all sorts of problems.  What are the Twitter accounts?  Because they really hate that we're giving up these Twitter accounts.  SiriusXM on Twitter.  SiriusXM on Twitter for all your complaints.  SiriusXM and SXM underscore help.  Okay.  Those are the two Twitter accounts.  You guys are driving those people crazy.  Which is good, because, you know, there's real questions coming in.  Are we going to the festival this year?  The comedy festival?  I don't know.  What? 
[00:05:00]  Comedy festival?  I haven't heard of it since the day it was suggested.  Travis?  Hmm?  You said you have a meeting for the comedy festival.  Montreal Comedy Festival?  Is that happening?  I don't want to spoil your meeting today.  Oh, please.  We have a meeting today.  No spoilers.  It's still looking very good.  Okay.  From what I hear.  Everything always looks very good.  Here's the thing, actually.  This has nothing to do, from what I understand, with this company.  It's SiriusXM Canada.  Right.  All those people got their shit together. 
[00:05:30]  And they're talking to Just for Laughs, but everybody's still on the same page.  Oh, Just for Laughs wants to do it?  Yeah.  When is it?  Just for Laughs, from what I understand, got good to do it.  July or something?  It's in July?  Yeah, late July.  Late July.  It'll be fun up there.  Montreal rules.  It is fun.  There's a couple different parts of the festival.  There's a French side, which we wouldn't do.  And then there's the...  The Greek side?  French and Greek.  Let's do the French side.  I've never been there.  What the hell, man?  All right, whatever.  And the bus tour is... 
[00:06:00]  Oh, that's happening in the fall.  No.  And nothing.  And then we got to meet with the guy who promised me that we would move the wall,  and then we don't move the wall, and he was the guy that...  He was the guy.  Yeah.  Like, he doesn't have to ask anyone else.  No.  I stood right outside that hallway.  I go, we want all this space.  He goes, well, I'm not really...  He was honest.  He's like, I don't know if I could give you all the space.  I'm like, all right, give us eight feet.  He goes, eight feet?  What, that would be about here?  And then he puts his arm like this.  I'm like, yeah, that's all we need.  And then he looked at what would be left for the new people. 
[00:06:30]  He's like, yeah, that's fine.  No problem.  Consider it done.  Consider it done.  And he's the guy.  Is it?  Well, consider it done.  Maybe he meant dung.  Consider it done.  It's shit.  You're not getting it.  He comes from the school of thought, just say yes to everything, and what?  It eventually just goes away?  He talks like a guy who's being kidnapped.  He always talks like a guy who's just anything to make it okay in that moment.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  So no, the wall was not moved because it cost, I don't know, $8 million or something like  that.  Yeah.  This is two stories.  I went to meditation last night.  I was telling Anthony, then you turn your phone on after a couple hours, and man, the  whole world changes.  You turn off your phone for two lousy hours and don't have really much human contact with  anyone, and you turn that phone back on two hours later, there's always some treat waiting  for you.  What happened?  That's what I was saying.  Yeah.  Twitter exploded for real. 
[00:07:30]  The tweets were unbelievable.  Everyone's like, oh my God, did you see the black guy, the eyewitness out of Cleveland?  Yeah.  And I was like, what the fuck is going on in Cleveland?  So I started reading Twitter longer.  You don't know what's going on?  No.  Jimmy doesn't know what's going on in Cleveland.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just read that story.  It's absolutely amazing.  These three broads.  This all went down at 8 o'clock last night.  They've been in a house basically chained up for 10 years in Cleveland.  This happens every so often.  You get these stories of these women that were abducted, and then years later, they find 
[00:08:00]  them somehow alive.  One has a kid, so apparently she had a child during the two kids.  Well, I know.  I know she had a six-year-old and an infant.  Well, they've been missing for 10 years.  She had two kids with the asshole that fucking captured her.  Three guys, right?  When the stories come out, you'll find out that they had the opportunity at some point  in these 10 years to get away, and somehow they just didn't. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  That phone call sounded like she was excited to be out.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they're always excited once they do finally get their freedom.  But in the interim, there's always these stories of like, well, they sent me to the store once, so I went and I got some milk and came back.  It's like, why didn't you fucking run?  They said they would do things.  Like, it's always some weird fucking thing.  Well, it's psychological.  Yeah, of course.  And the girls were young when they were abducted, right?  How old were they?  14?  16 and 21. 
[00:09:00]  So now they're 24, 26, 31.  A decade of your life.  In a small house with your neighbors, very close.  Three men have been arrested.  Oh, now it's up to three men.  Yeah, it said three Hispanic men have been arrested.  So I don't know if it was a Spanish neighborhood or if they were young in Spanish.  It looks like it's a Spanish neighborhood.  España.  Didn't he have a Puerto Rican flag right on his front porch there?  Fucking 10 years, man.  A decade of your life.  And the saddest part, one of the women that was abducted, her mom died. 
[00:09:30]  Her mom died in 2006.  And they all say, with a broken heart.  It was the stress of her daughter being missing.  Two years after her daughter was missing, the mom died.  And they all said, from a broken heart.  So she's got to deal with that.  Because she's probably running out of the house.  Can't wait to see mommy.  Oh, I can't wait to see.  Oh, mommy died eight years ago.  Whoops.  These guys should be executed.  Not it.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Executed.  Yeah, they'll have a nice life in prison.  It'll be easy.  They'll get to watch Homeland and shit.  They'll have lawyers that'll say, no, these girls, they stayed voluntarily.  It was great.  Look, they could have left.  But they didn't.  Oh, stop.  They're...  And they had a kid with the guy.  Oh, gee.  Yeah.  You don't know who's...  It's like that guy who kidnapped his daughter or whatever.  And the wife had no idea.  And she was 20 years downstairs.  I guess you...  Joseph Fritzl or whatever.  Fritzl, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  You just don't know when the guy's home.  There was a case of a guy who was kidnapping me.  He was a gay serial killer.  And he was hitting men over the head.  And he would tie them up and torture them.  And there was one guy who he fucking, like, gave the remote to watch television to.  And he would keep you for a week, two weeks, just torture, rape you, and then kill you.  He was a fucking bad dude.  And then the guy got out of the ties and was going to escape.  But he just didn't know if the guy was home. 
[00:11:00]  Like, he had no idea.  The guy left.  Was he here?  And he wound up going out.  Like, he escaped through the roof.  And the guy was out at the time.  But it's like...  What was he watching on the television?  Well, apparently the Nielsen radio had just come in.  It's funny you ask, Larry.  But, like, that's the problem is you don't know if they're home.  So the one shot you take, you're afraid that they'll be home and kill you.  Because he thought he was going to be...  But he knew he'd probably be killed if he didn't.  So he wound up getting away.  Wow.  And they got this guy.  Where was he out of?  I forget where he was. 
[00:11:30]  I've never heard of this because of the creep.  You know how I got to him?  Remember we were looking at pictures of victims?  The last picture's taken?  Oh, yeah.  One of the guys that was tied up, I thought was so chilling that I investigated the guy who did it.  And the guy who did it had killed a bunch of people.  And wound up going to prison and dying in prison.  Oh.  How many did he kill in the end?  No, man.  I want to say five or six.  He knows his serial killer shit.  I don't remember this guy's name, though.  Is that him?  That's the guy.  Oh, God.  I don't believe so.  No.  Then we won't say anything.  Believe it or not, there's more than one gay serial killer. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, Randy Kraft was a fucking...  Was a doozy.  What did he do?  California.  Well, I think they said he killed like 60 people.  He would tie guys up and he would torture their nipples with the cigarette lighters from  a car.  He would torture their cocks with like fucking branches.  He would put sticks in their cock holes.  Yeah.  He was a naughty boy.  He liked men, though.  He didn't like kids.  He was a...  What's that all about?  I did.  I couldn't know how to ask him.  Why do you want to stick something in a guy's pee hole?  He would pick guys up hitchhiking, like Marines and shit, like real men. 
[00:12:30]  And he would drug the drink and give them a drink.  Oh, man.  And that's how he got busted.  He got pulled over and he had a fucking guy in his car, his passenger seat.  And the cop walked over and Randy got out of the car to meet the cop halfway.  Oh, that's always a song, right?  But he had a dead guy in the car.  He had to do something.  Right, right, right.  Oh, man.  And the guy's pants were like askew or like there was something about the...  Or Randy's pants.  The cop just, of course, smelled the rat.  And then nailed him.  That's how Bundy got busted.  He had to fucking get pulled over.  These guys always get pulled over.  Well, why don't you go 10 and 2 when you have a dead body in the car? 
[00:13:00]  Be a very responsible...  With a taillight or something.  Well, what do they get Ted Bundy on?  Are doing 10 and 2 and don't get caught.  I know.  Yeah.  But how did they pull Ted Bundy over?  For what?  He had escaped.  I mean, he was in Florida.  He had a car.  I honestly...  It might have just been a small moving violation.  But he had...  I think the cop noticed he had no passenger seat.  Right.  And there was some kind of tools.  Um...  But you don't know what the initial pullover was.  No.  I mean, it might have been a red light or something.  He failed to pull over for a routine traffic stop.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, just routine.  It might have just been a signal.  Just bad luck.  The officer noted that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat was missing.  Searched his car.  Found a ski mask.  Second mask.  So if they didn't have the routine checkpoint, he would have been on his way.  Well, is it a routine traffic stop?  Could have been anything.  It might have just been he ran a yellow.  They've gotten so many fucking people through shit like that.  Yeah.  You look at Son of Sam.  They got him on a fucking parking ticket.  Yeah.  They got...  McVeigh was pulled over. 
[00:14:00]  I guess...  Before...  Yeah.  Before the bombing.  Oh, it was before.  Okay.  And they figured something out.  Was it before or was it after?  No.  It was after.  Because he was in jail.  He had arrested on a warrant.  Right.  Right.  It was after the bombing.  Yeah.  Those little fucking weird turn of events that happened afterwards.  Yeah.  A little luck.  That's the luck factor.  So we go back to Cleveland.  The three Cleveland women found alive after 10 years.  That's amazing.  In this creep's house.  Yeah.  They showed the street.  The houses were on top of each other.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  So obviously more is going to come out today and tomorrow.  The first three days of a story like this are where you get all your info.  All the good stuff.  Yeah.  And they'll pull out all the fucking news celebrities that this has happened to.  That's smart.  What's her name?  Amanda.  Elizabeth Smart.  Elizabeth Smart.  Who was she missing for a year or less than that?  She was missing for longer than that, I think.  Was she?  What about the other one that was a couple years ago?  Wasn't that a long, long time?  And she had...  Yeah.  There was one who was like 20 years or something. 
[00:15:00]  It was 20 years, right?  Yep.  And she ended up having a kid or two with that guy.  Yeah.  She was living in a little structure behind the guy's...  Outside.  Shed, yeah.  Outside in the yard kind of thing.  I guess you can never give up for that reason.  I'm guessing what happens is after a while, you're probably chained up miserably for a  while.  And then you get these little comforts.  Like maybe they take the gag off or maybe...  And then you're afraid if you scream, it's going to be right back to a fucking gas rag  in your mouth or whatever.  But this guy was having barbecues with his neighbors. 
[00:15:30]  Was he?  Yes.  I thought it was a barbecue.  Greatest lady ever.  Yeah, we got some audio to play.  You just have barbecues?  Yeah, man.  With the black guy that saved the broads.  Wait.  Is that how they got caught?  After a barbecue?  No.  I'm still confused.  Like she was trying to get out of the house?  Yeah, I guess.  And this black guy saw and heard the commotion?  Yeah, he explains it.  Yeah, because the houses are so close and he sees his...  Which one was trying to get out?  Amanda Barry.  Do we have Amanda's 911 call? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah, we got her chilling 911 call.  The chilling 911 call.  She's fucking trying to get out of this house desperately and then the black guy sees the  commotion and then goes and helps her.  She was kicking at the door and the door was chained, I guess, and she got an arm out and  she was kind of like fussing and kicking and her arm was hanging out the door and that's  when the black guy saw that and like kicked the door down and...  Well, he was enjoying...  The three guys are apparently brothers. 
[00:16:30]  He was enjoying his McDonald's, wasn't he?  Yeah, well, of course.  He was enjoying his McDonald's, heard the commotion, came outside.  I wonder if that was the first time she got upstairs or had...  Well, I'm sure they'll all come out.  Believe me, there's a book and a movie in this.  Oh, yes.  They're bringing in the dogs today, so...  Let's see if there's any more.  They have some suspicions because there's some other, you know, girls or women missing  in the area.  All these Christmases and fucking Thanksgivings, these fucking cocksuckers, man.  Imagine if they were just having the best time inside, treating them all nicely. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, they were all mad that the cops came.  Like, what are you doing?  You're ruining the party.  Nice tits.  They're going to be all fucked up psychologically, huh?  Yeah.  The one in the middle is Amanda Barry.  Yeah.  That's Amanda Barry.  The one on the left is her sister.  And this is recently, right?  That was last night.  Yeah, she's still young.  She's 27, 17 when she was taken.  14 and 24.  From a Burger King restaurant that she worked at.  You still have your whole life, but 21 or 31, it's like you just lost a decade.  Yeah, you got your whole life with extreme psychological issues. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That will haunt you at night, no matter how much therapy you got.  Fucking terrible.  Oh, your prime Anthony dating years are gone.  Oh, please.  Well, they were almost done before they got kidnapped anyway.  They were at the tail end of it?  Yeah, the 21-year-old was over there.  She was old hat.  Old hat.  She knew where not to look.  So, anyway, she gets out after clawing her way through the front door, and then the black  guy helps her.  And this is her 911 call.  This is the long version.  The news is only playing, you know, a quick snippet. 
[00:18:00]  Who's the 911?  Do you need police?  Help me, I'm Amanda Barry.  You need police, fire, or ambulance?  I need police.  What's interesting, she's like, help me, I'm Amanda Barry.  She knew that she was pretty fucking famous in that area.  It's Amanda?  Amanda Barry?  She probably saw all the stories on TV.  She went, holy fuck, I'm famous in this area.  She says in the clip, she's like, I've been on the news.  Oh, so she must have seen that.  How horrific is that, seeing news stories of yourself on TV? 
[00:18:30]  The thing that bothers me about this clip is, as it goes on, the 911 operator, I don't  think understands who she is.  Of course not.  She's starting to get, like, really annoyed, like, all right, just stay there.  The cops are coming.  Relax.  But the 911 operators, they know everything.  They told them to stand down.  They told George Zimmerman to stand down.  Shut up.  911 operator, please.  I used to get mad at the 911 operators.  But as soon as the call comes in, they're, you know, they're on it, right? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It's just her job to kind of get the info as the cops are already doing their thing,  I assume.  Because these are the same people that get the calls that say, there's not enough cheese  on my Whopper.  Right, right, right.  So they have to weed through a lot of fucking wackos.  That's a rough job.  As soon as they hear a panic like that, I just assume they're already on their way, and it's  just the operator talking them through basic info at that point.  Police, fire, ambulance, like, the first thing, what do you, like, enough shit.  I hope that's how it works.  Because if it's not that way, then this is bad. 
[00:19:30]  You'll hear on the clip, she's like, all right, yeah, we'll get somebody as soon as we have  a car available.  Yeah, no, a car open, she says.  Yeah, well, I mean, they're busy with other shit.  They're kidding up a tree, you fucking bitch.  Yeah.  In the car.  Do you understand?  I'm Amanda Berry.  Who's Amanda 1-1-1-2?  Hello, please.  Help me, I'm Amanda Berry.  You need police, fire, or ambulance?  I need police.  Okay, and what's going on there?  I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm here, I'm free now. 
[00:20:00]  Okay, and what's your address?  2207 Seymour Avenue.  2207 Seymour.  Seymour Butts.  2210.  It looks like you're calling me from 2210.  I can't hear you.  It looks like you're calling me from 2210 Seymour.  I'm across the street, I'm using the phone.  Okay, stay there with those neighbors, Bobby, let's leave when they get there.  Okay.  Why would you stay across the street?  With the neighbors.  Yeah, but fuck that.  Look how close these houses are.  I'm going to run. 
[00:20:30]  If the Hispanic comes out that front door looking for his catch.  Yeah.  Who knows what he's capable of doing?  Fuck that.  Another thing you could do in times like that too, is if they say, call the fire department  too.  Get them both there.  Oh yeah.  Because the fire department comes with those big loud ass trucks.  Everybody.  Yeah.  There's nothing worse when you're doing something wrong with them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm Amanda Barry.  I'm Amanda Barry. 
[00:21:00]  That's my Edgar repellent.  Edgar hates that.  I'm going to phone.  Okay, stay there with those neighbors.  Talk to the police when they get there.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay, talk to the police when they get there.  Okay.  Hello?  Yeah, talk to the police when they get there.  Okay, I'm going to wait right now.  We're going to send them as soon as we get a car open.  No, I need them now.  I'm going to get them back.  All right, we're sending them, okay? 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  I mean, like, right now.  Who's the guy who went out?  His name is Ariel Castro.  All right, how old is he?  He's like 52.  All right, and...  I'm Amanda Barry.  I've been on the news for the last 10 years.  Okay, I got that here.  I already...  And you said, what was his name again?  Ariel Castro.  And is he white, black, or Hispanic?  I'm Hispanic.  What's he wearing?  I don't know, because he's not here right now. 
[00:22:00]  When he left, what was he wearing?  Oh, yeah, it's a face.  What?  The police are on the way.  Talk to them when they get there.  Okay?  I need...  Okay.  I told you they're on the way.  Talk to them when they get there, okay?  All right, okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  Wow, fucking chilling.  Did that 911 operator actually get off the phone with her?  Yeah, what the fuck?  What a dumb fuck.  You stay on the fucking phone.  You got somebody who's been missing for 10 years,  and this dumb motherfucker is going...  Talk to them when they get there.  Yeah, well, he sees other calls coming in. 
[00:22:30]  But...  That's true.  But no, but still, this is one you say,  fuck everything, I gotta stay on the line with this girl.  And you don't know, at that point,  what the situation is.  Of course.  You don't know if she's still in danger or something.  You stay on the fucking phone.  You don't know where the guy went to after he left his house.  He could have just been, you know,  borrowing something from a neighbor.  Who knows?  What a dummy.  He walked down the street,  walked his dog.  I don't know.  Is that chilling or what?  Yeah.  She's just expecting everything to just, you know, 
[00:23:00]  be there for her immediately,  and she still has to explain herself.  Yeah, well,  gotta free up a car.  It's like about lunchtime.  So, what was he wearing for 10 years?  Give me every fucking little costume change.  You know Sylvia Brown?  The old lady psychic.  Yeah.  That's very creepy when she talks.  Yes.  I think she was on Montel Williams,  I want to say. 
[00:23:30]  And she told,  I think it's Amanda Berry's mom,  that Amanda Berry was dead.  She did her little reading on Montel Williams  and said,  I'm sorry to tell you about it.  Oh, did she?  But your daughter is dead.  She had a 50-50 shot of getting it right.  No kidding.  The kid's alive.  The kid's dead.  There were a lot of people  that believed in Sylvia Brown,  but she's had some...  Please.  Some fucking bad ones.  Has she?  Oh, yeah.  I know her name.  Did you find that clip?  It might be online there.  Montel Williams, Sylvia Brown.  That was a great bullshit, 
[00:24:00]  Penn and Teller bullshit episode  on the psychic fucking,  psychics helping the cops and stuff  and how it just doesn't fucking work.  Right.  Never has.  Maybe put Berry in, too,  to see Psychic gets busted.  Yeah, no, we played that one in the past.  That's the famous one.  I happen to believe.  If someone has a link to this,  that'd be great.  You take all your negativity  and you carry it under your hat,  I happen to believe.  Good psychic.  Carried under your hat.  Yeah, you take your negativity to the bank. 
[00:24:30]  This fucking neighbor,  the black guy.  Yeah, we're about to play his shit.  You mean New Orleans looter?  Yeah, the looter.  He does look just like the Heineken looter from...  He looks like the guy from New Orleans.  Katrina.  Oh, God.  And, um...  Boy, the media loves the Black Witness.  The Black Witness is the best fucking thing.  Charles Ramsey's name is.  Yeah.  It's the greatest invention ever.  Oh. 
[00:25:00]  The local news just searched out  any black person in the area  when these big stories go down.  Well, the white reporter  that was talking to him  that I saw last night,  he was loving it.  He's got the mic in his face.  He's asking him questions  because it's all gold.  And then he said something  to the effect of,  well, you know,  you know there's trouble  when a white woman runs  into the arms of a black man.  He goes,  because that just don't happen.  And you saw the white reporter  at that point.  He's like,  blah, blah.  Well, thank you very much.  He couldn't get away  from the potential racial fucking problem 
[00:25:30]  he was running into.  The potential angle?  Yeah, yeah.  Scared whitey.  Oh, don't talk like that.  Oh, I gotta run away.  What do you got there, Travis?  I just keep,  I'm reading updates  about this story on Gawker  and the suspect's son  is a journalist  and he wrote about this case  in 2004.  He must have an amazing angle.  Yeah.  He had no idea, huh?  No idea.  He had no idea  that his father was the guy?  Come on. 
[00:26:00]  Who knows?  Maybe they were strange, too.  This is gonna be some shit  that comes out.  Yeah.  This is gonna get  really interesting.  If you're not living with the guy,  like, huh?  I don't know what's going on.  I think my father's  been kidnapping people.  Oh.  It's really weird.  I'm like,  what have you been doing, Daddy?  He goes,  nothing.  I'm just digging in the yard  and I'll call you later.  I think they find dead bodies today.  I think they find a body or two  in that backyard.  Thank you.  Yeah, I think so.  Maybe a couple that they caught  that weren't cooperative.  A real kiss.  Here's the eyewitness 
[00:26:30]  that helped Amanda Barry  get out of the house,  the black guy  that everyone's talking about today.  Hey, Charles,  let me talk to you.  I'm talking with Charles Ramsey.  He's a neighbor.  Walk me through again  what happened this afternoon.  You heard screaming.  Heard screaming.  I meet my McDonald's.  I come outside.  I see this girl going nuts  trying to get out of her house.  So I go on the porch  and she says,  help me get out.  I've been in here a long time. 
[00:27:00]  So, you know,  I figured it's a domestic violence dispute.  So I open the door  and we can't get in that way  because how the door is,  it's so much  that the body can't fit through,  only your hand.  So we kick the bottom  and she comes out  with the little girl  and she says,  call 911.  My name was Amanda Barry.  Did you know who that was  when she said that?  Well, she told me  it didn't register  until I got to call the 911.  And I'm like,  I'm calling the 911  for Amanda Barry.  I thought this girl was dead. 
[00:27:30]  You know what I mean?  And she got on the phone  and she said,  yes, this is me.  And the detective,  Cook,  right here,  detective Gregory Cook  says,  Charles,  do you know who you rescued?  I said,  I said,  and when did you see it?  When did you see it?  That's great.  The best part  is when there's a cop sound.  Oh, yeah.  His immediate,  he went from,  he went from helpful witness  on the news  to,  I'm a black guy in Cleveland  that I just heard a police noise.  That siren 
[00:28:00]  that you just heard  in the background,  he stopped  and his eyes opened,  he turned his head like,  he snapped his neck.  He was ready to run.  He was thinking,  Pavlov's dog.  He was thinking,  what the hell did I do?  Yeah.  Shit.  You want to just play it from here?  Yeah.  Know what that means?  He's really guilty of something.  Oh, he's got some warrants.  I bet you this turns out bad  for the poor guy.  Yeah, they're going to hear the...  And on a side note,  you might remember Mr. Ramsey  who did the interview.  He is now in prison. 
[00:28:30]  Because there's never  a fucking Hollywood ending, man.  No.  There's always a twist.  All the shit always ends up bad.  He's our hero today,  but they're going to get him  on something.  The look he gave.  That means he's scared  of something in his past.  He stopped in his tracks.  He stopped.  His eyes got real wide  and he turned his head like,  aw, shit.  I say it now.  They're going to get him  on something, unfortunately.  Which makes this  a shitty ending again.  Cook. 
[00:29:00]  Right here.  Detective Gregory Cook says,  Charles, do you know  who you rescued?  I said...  When did you see that?  He's like...  Oh, that's the one.  He's like, aw, shit.  Aw, shit.  That look he gives to the left.  Oh, my God.  It's perfect.  Oh, fuck.  Cook.  Right here.  Detective Gregory Cook says,  Charles, do you know  who you rescued?  I said...  I can't get it  on to that.  It's fucking...  His face is... 
[00:29:30]  He's staring.  Oh, man.  That's the guy with warrants.  Yeah, he's like,  aw, you've got to be  shitting me.  Because I think he's only  been in the neighborhood  a year.  Oh, is he?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He's probably hiding  from some dumb thing.  I don't even think  it's that bad of a charge,  but...  Oh, my God.  Somebody's going to have  to deal with  in the next couple weeks.  Mark our word.  Yes.  Yes, that look  is not the look  of a guy that...  Yeah, it's going to be...  Remember Charles...  Charles Ramsey. 
[00:30:00]  Charles Ramsey.  Well...  Now, when did you see...  When did you see Gina?  About...  About five...  About five minutes  after the police got here.  The police?  The girl Amanda  told the police,  I ain't just the only ones.  It's some more girls  up in that house.  It's some more girls.  So they went up there,  you know,  30, 40 deep,  and when they came out  was just astonishing  because I thought 
[00:30:30]  they were going to come  up with nothing.  I figured, I mean,  whoever she was,  and like I said,  my neighbor,  you got some big testicles  to pull this off, bro,  because we see this dude  every day.  I mean, every day.  How long have you lived here?  I've been here a year.  You see what I'm coming from?  I barbecue with this dude.  We eat ribs and whatnot.  This is salsa music.  You see what I'm coming from?  And you had no indication  that there was anything going on?  We had an egg roll,  not a clue  that that girl  was in that house  or anybody else  was in there  against their will 
[00:31:00]  because how he is  is he just comes out  to his backyard,  plays with the dogs,  take it with his cars  and motorcycles,  goes back in the house.  So he's somebody  that you look  and you look away  because he's not doing  nothing but the average stuff.  You see what I'm saying?  There's nothing exciting  about him.  Well, until today.  There's some action  on the girl's faces.  I can't imagine  to see the sunlight  to be around people.  I knew something was wrong  when a little pretty white girl  ran into a black man's arms.  Something was wrong here.  Dead giveaway. 
[00:31:30]  Dead giveaway.  Charles, thank you very much.  Dead giveaway.  The reporter can't get away  fast enough now.  Dead giveaway.  Dead giveaway.  Like, why would you  walk away from him  at that point?  He's the guy you want  to fucking talk to.  Because he's smart  because I would have gotten fired  trying to be funny.  I would have said like,  yeah, those are some  of my favorite pornos.  Huh?  Nothing.  Nothing, sir.  Ha ha.  Good point.  Good point.  She homeless  or she got problems.  That's the only reason  why she run into a black man.  Charles, thank you  for being there, man.  Charles Ramsey, 
[00:32:00]  neighbor,  heard the screaming,  took action,  went and did  what he needed to do.  The rest is unfolding  before us here  on Seymour.  We're going to send it  back to you.  Unbelievable story.  Those guys,  the guys who are kidnapped,  they're probably going  to get in trouble.  Oh, they're in touch.  Unbelievable.  Do you have Sylvia Brown?  Can we find that clip?  Yeah, it's got to be somewhere.  I'm looking.  We'll find it.  But she said a few years  back that the girl  was dead.  Have Ernie pull it.  Who?  I just like making up people.  Oh. 
[00:32:30]  Make up people.  Someone texted me,  I mean,  sorry,  Twitter me,  about the guy we were  talking about,  the serial killer.  They said he's from  Kansas or something  and he poured drain cleaner  in one of his victim's eyes.  If that's the guy.  Ugh.  Let me see.  Have you seen that photo?  That's him.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Robert Andrew Berdella. 
[00:33:00]  Robert Andrew,  he died of cancer in jail,  I think, yeah.  Yeah,  it helped Medicare  cover him.  I was hoping someone  found that clip,  but I don't see it yet  on the Twitter.  The Twitter?  Hopey Radio,  if you got the Montel  William Sylvia Brown clip  where Sylvia Brown  says this girl was dead  when she did her psychic shit  in front of that live audience.  We barbecued.  We have ribs.  Listen to salsa music.  We got Buzz Aldrin  coming in in a few minutes already. 
[00:33:30]  Buzz.  Buzz.  So that's all we know  on this story so far.  So far.  Are the three girls healthy  and their kids healthy?  How many kids are there  all together?  I've heard two.  I've seen reports  of a six-year-old  and then an infant.  Six-year-old.  So there's no record  of the six-year-old?  I read that this morning.  No.  I doubt she was going to school.  They never went to the hospital.  Yeah, obviously.  No, I know.  I'm just saying.  Is that the six-year-old  right there?  I think so.  So that girl...  Oh, my God.  I can't confirm that. 
[00:34:00]  And then you got a daughter  with the fucking...  It's amazing.  That kid definitely looks like,  you know,  half Hispanic.  Yes, definitely.  And she's stuck with her forever.  She's stuck.  She loves the hell  out of the kid.  But, I mean,  you have to look,  you have to think of him.  No kidding.  That's fucked up.  How do you work  that through your head?  All three are in stable condition.  The three missing girls.  They're all stable.  And one report says,  investigative sources say  chains found hanging  from the ceiling.  Jesus.  Oh, that's never good. 
[00:34:30]  So all three brothers  probably just fucked  all three girls  for years.  That's what they were  probably subjected to.  Yeah, I'm sure  it wasn't pleasant.  So what do we do  with these guys?  Execute them.  They won't.  What they should do  is just put bullets in them.  There's no redeeming value  in society for these people.  At all.  Zero.  No.  Wow.  I have some good questions  for Buzz Aldrin,  by the way.  Oh.  You do.  They told me  I should have been  an astronaut in school 
[00:35:00]  because I just took up space.  Fucking watch him crack up.  That's a good joke.  He probably has  never heard that either.  I'm going to do  an April Fool's joke.  No, don't do  an April Fool's joke  on Buzz.  How old is Buzz Aldrin now?  41.  It's amazing.  41?  Man.  I'm guessing he's  80-something?  He's 80, yeah.  And we had him on  how many years ago now?  Four or five.  Was it that long ago?  Yeah.  And now,  the woman he was with 
[00:35:30]  that day,  they were getting  a divorce, right?  Oh, shit.  I believe so.  At that point,  wouldn't you just  stay in there?  Oh.  Cheaper to keeper.  People are sending me  the article where  Amanda Berry's mother  asked psychic  Sylvia Brown,  is she out there?  And Sylvia Brown  said she was dead.  Yeah, I've got the article.  I know.  Because a lot of people  are reposting it today.  Right.  But none of these articles  are linking to a clip,  so I would assume  that if there's one 
[00:36:00]  out there,  they would have already.  Yeah, of course.  We'll find it.  When you're one of  fucking 12 people  that walked on the moon,  you should be able  to do whatever  the fuck you want.  Of course.  If you want to get a divorce  and not have to give her  anything,  you fucking,  you got that.  You don't want to pay taxes?  You get that.  Well, she helped him  walk on the moon, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Even though they probably  got married after the fact.  Yeah, yeah.  So all his...  Settled their divorce.  Yeah, I remember.  It was pretty ugly  for Buzz Aldrin.  Poor Buzz.  She had absolutely 
[00:36:30]  nothing to do  with his walking  on the moon  and his walking  on the moon money,  but she gets  a shitload of it.  She wasn't up there  fucking looking back  at a little fucking Earth  going,  yeah, we got to get  back there, apparently.  I can get back.  I bet you he wants  to get back there.  Get away from her.  Oh, yeah.  Especially when you're  the second guy  on the moon.  Yeah.  He's checked in already,  so we got to think quick.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we break?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll set the field  for Buzz Aldrin.  Stay there.  You're listening  to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:37:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Coming up this week  on At The Movies  with Norton and Voss,  the guys review  the latest Liam Neeson  thriller,  Taken 2.  It was awful.  It was great.  It stunk.  It was fucking great.  How he just beat everybody up.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage. 
[00:37:30]  Don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big dad.  Stepdad.  Have pony.  And then at the end  he brings the fucking  big singer.  I saved her life.  It was fucking horrendous.  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good.  Yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up  on the next At The Movies  with Norton and Voss.  The O.P. & Anthony Show  is back. 
[00:38:00]  The O.P. & Anthony Show  is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready  to entertain you some more.  Got Buzz Aldrin  about to enter the studio.  An American hero.  He's got a new book  called Mission to Mars.  My vision for space exploration.  Pull that chair out for a...  Buzz Aldrin,  welcome back to  The O.P. & Anthony Show.  Do you have any relation  to the O.P. on TV?  Oh!  Well...  Ron Howard.  No relationship. 
[00:38:30]  No?  But I was named  after him, sir.  Because I looked like him  when he was a little boy.  We're on, too.  You see now.  Oh, there we go.  And we had Ron Howard.  Pull up a chair, sir.  And we discussed that.  And it was a terrific day.  Yes, Ron Howard  is the TV O.P.  Yeah, we had him  on the show.  No, no, no.  This isn't the actor.  This is the manager  of the Beverly Hills Hotel.  Oh!  That's a different guy.  Oh, really?  I was going to a debate  at the Reagan Library. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And my girlfriend  tried to buy a tie  downstairs.  60 bucks.  She said,  I'm not going to pay  60 bucks for a tie.  And so Ron says,  here, take mine.  And then I'm walking  down the hallway  and I remember  I don't have a belt.  He took his belt off.  Wow!  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That's what you get.  It's good to be  Buzz Aldrin, isn't it?  An American hero.  National hero.  I need a tie.  I just hand you a tie.  Yeah, exactly.  You got a lot of crystals  on or something.  He wanted it back. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, he did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, did he?  What's all the crystals  about?  The bracelets.  There's something  going on there.  Evil spirits.  Yeah.  Ah, ah.  Oh, peace.  Okay.  Gotta keep those away.  Buzz, pleasure to have  you here, obviously.  And you have  Mission to Mars,  my vision for space  exploration.  Missions.  Missions.  We tried to put an S  on it and they,  no, no, I can't do that.  Oh, so they just went  mission.  But you're talking  multiple missions.  This is ongoing.  Right, right, right.  Sustaining. 
[00:40:00]  They don't come back.  Oh, really?  Okay, all right.  Why don't they come back?  Is it just the distance  is too far?  A lot of reasons.  We want to build up  as rapidly as we can  a sustaining number  and if you want 60 people  there, it takes 20 years  to, nobody's going to  build a 100-person  spacecraft.  Right.  So you just get them  there every 26 months.  Ferry them over there.  That's when Earth  goes around twice  and a little bit more  Mars goes around once 
[00:40:30]  or a little closer.  Right, right.  The timing has to be  impeccable with the  launch.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you build  the Omega Watches?  Yeah, the Omega Watch.  I remember those  commercials.  They were, hey,  we're the Watch  of the Astronauts.  Do you build the  Habitat, how do you  build the Habitat first?  Is there a lunar,  like a, something that  builds it first before  they arrive or how do  they build where  they're going to live?  Well, you need a short  transmission time.  Not even from the  Earth to the Moon.  That's the second and 
[00:41:00]  a half, three seconds  round trip to see  what you, whether it  did what you told it  to do.  So we practice  on the big island  of Hawaii  when somebody designs  what the International  Lunar Base should be  about.  So we practice  and rehearse  and work out  the kinks.  Then we do it  on the Moon  for the other  international countries.  We do it from  a control base  on the far side  of the Moon.  It's a neutral  gravity point 
[00:41:30]  50,000 miles away.  So we put a control  center there  to do the  robotic science  and for the  caterpillar digging  crystals from the  dark parts  of the craters.  But its big job  is to learn how  to land  to put these  things together.  And these are not  small.  They're big.  And they've got to  travel over somewhat  uncertain terrain.  Right. 
[00:42:00]  Then dock with each  other.  Hook up the  electrical leads.  Nobody knows how  to do that.  Right.  So that's why  we've got to  practice to do it  at the Moon  for the internationals  and tourist type  people.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then we do it  from the Moon of Mars  onto the surface  of Mars.  And what about  one thing they say  with astronauts  traveling three years  in space or whatever  it is,  is illness,  cancer,  broken bones,  do they have 
[00:42:30]  a technology yet  where they can  kind of monitor  you on a  microscopic level?  Is that what  they're working on  to kind of  catch these things  before they get  started in astronauts?  Well, it's called  an EKG.  If you go to an  auction,  you can get  kneels and  find EKGs  at an auction  during landing.  Yeah, they're  actually selling  your EKGs  from when you  were touching  down on the Moon.  Interesting.  I thought  at first  it was just  normal.  Nothing was  different. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  But were you  too little  wound up?  But it's  taken, you  know,  several years  to put together  this plan  that really  tightens things  up with the  whole space  program.  We look at  space policy  as it evolved  since rockets  first came out.  Sputnik,  Yuri Gagarin,  and our  reaction to  that with  Mercury catching  up during the 
[00:43:30]  Gemini program  and Apollo.  Then we start  running into  things where  things didn't  quite go right.  We made some  bad mistakes  that took  away what we  would love to  have today.  And then  Bush said  the same as  the accident  board,  retire the  orbiter at  the end of  2010.  That's ten  years to  come, I  mean seven  years to  come up  with a  substitute.  It still  isn't there.  Right. 
[00:44:00]  And  that's a  shame.  It's a  I really  it hurts to  watch and  see what's  happening to  the space  program.  The shuttle  wasn't the  original design  at all.  It wasn't?  No.  Two stage  fully reusable  wings and  wheels on the  orbiter,  wings and  wheels on the  booster.  That's what  we'd love to  have now.  But there  are reasons  why that  didn't happen  and generally  like so many  things, it's  short-term  objectives and  politics. 
[00:44:30]  So this  foundation is  going to look  at space  policy,  exploration,  science,  development,  commercial,  and security.  Now I put  security first,  but I'd be a  warmonger if I  did that.  But it's also  planetary defense  from asteroids  impacting.  And what  is really  needed now  is a test  bed at the  station for  long-term  life support.  Okay,  NASA needs  that in a 
[00:45:00]  bad way.  The space  station needs  something to  do.  And this  Inspiration  Mars mission  with the  married couple  leaving in  January of  2018 for  500 days  flyby of  Mars,  that's a  great stimulation.  There are  some other  political  stimulations  that need  to be  cultivated by  people like  you for, 
[00:45:30]  well,  even before  the end of  Obama's term.  Because if he  helps who he  thinks is going  to win,  then who he  thinks is going  to win has a  marvelous opportunity  as approaching  the 50th  anniversary of  the first  through the  last,  centered around  the re-election  of 2020.  Okay?  So either  Obama's  successor  makes a  meaningful  commitment 
[00:46:00]  within two  decades for  permanence on  Mars,  or if he  doesn't,  she doesn't,  why the  guy running  against him  or her  says,  well,  no problem  because Obama  didn't pay any  attention to the  50th anniversary  of Kennedy's  speech sending  us to the  moon.  Why should  anybody in  that administration  care about  50th  anniversaries  and commitments  to the future? 
[00:46:30]  Can you  imagine what  Earth history  is going to be  like two,  three hundred  years from  now when  it records  a leader  on Earth  of an  organization  that made  a commitment  and saw it  follow through  for human  beings from  the Earth  to make  a two-planet  system for  human beings  by beginning  permanence on  another planet.  That would be  amazing.  Now that is  going to go  down in  history.  I had  a religious 
[00:47:00]  guy standing  next to me  as I was  explaining it  that guy is  going to be  in history  greater than  Alexander the  Great,  Columbus,  Genghis Khan,  Moses,  Abraham,  and Jesus  Christ.  Oh, he  didn't like  that.  He probably  liked a lot  of them,  but not that  last one.  Can I ask  you, too,  they say that  I've always  heard that  they were  going to  colonize  the one  I.O.  is that  Jupiter 
[00:47:30]  moon,  they said  was a good  candidate for  it, too.  That's got  volcanoes all  the time.  Oh, so is  that not a  good candidate?  No, that's  not a good  place.  Are there  any of the  Jupiter moons  that are  or no?  Maybe I'm  thinking of  the wrong  one.  Yeah, I  kind of  lose track  of the  names,  but there's  one that  has ice,  and you  can see the  cracks in  the ice,  and the  ice may  be 15,  20 miles  deep.  Ice on  top of  water, and 
[00:48:00]  at the  bottom of  the water,  of course  may be  the same  tidal  effects on  the rocks  of this  moon, that  may cause  the same  vents around  which all  sorts of  animals are  found here  on Earth  with no  sunlight, just  salt water  and the  minerals coming  up from the  deep vents.  so there  are a number  of people  who think 
[00:48:30]  that might  have some  life.  Of course,  they breathe  water, and  they don't  come to the  surface, and  they don't  text or  email.  You've heard a  lot of things  talk about  astronauts that  see these  things when  they're traveling,  and I don't  know whether to  believe it or  not, and  there was a  guy who came  out recently,  I don't  remember his  name, his  name was,  you'll know him,  Ed, he was an  astronaut.  And he  said, Dr.  Ed Mitchell,  he's saying  that he saw 
[00:49:00]  extraterrestrial  craft, or he  said he saw  something, and  it's really hard  to discount an  astronaut.  I mean, you  can write off  certain people.  Oh, I don't  find that any  trouble at all.  You don't  have trouble  discounting  that?  He's a great  one for psychic  communication.  So he was  going to do  an experiment  when he went  to the moon  and it  was to  look and 
[00:49:30]  concentrate  on certain  playing cards  or numbers,  whatever it  was, and  somebody back  on Earth  was to get  the message.  It was so  wrong that  they started  thinking there  must be a  correlation with  it being so  wrong.  because it's  so wrong.  It has to  be something.  It must be  some creatures  to reverse it.  This Mars  missions, though,  people always  look back at  the Kennedy  speech about  the moon, and 
[00:50:00]  it's one of the  great points of  this country and  what we achieved  over that amount  of time, and it  was time, and a  lot of work went  into that, obviously  you know.  Where is that  passion these days  with the American  people, the pride  to see something  like that happen  again?  I don't know,  but I think, you  know, people wrote  the history, a very  classic history of  that time period, and  the timeliness of  that commitment, and  he drew a 
[00:50:30]  conclusion saying  that the elements  that were coming  together at that  time just could  never repeat  themselves, and he  didn't think there  would be any way.  But if we submit  things to the  president like we  did, and it's  called a flexible  path, which means  you're ready to do  a lot of things, but  no destination and  no time period, why  then somebody in the  administration, whether 
[00:51:00]  they were looking at  my submission or  not, which had  tests of the  interplanetary  spacecraft, initial  ones, where one  year you fly by a  comet, well, so  what?  It's a test of the  spacecraft, but as you  fly by the comet, you  crash the upper stage  into the comet, so  everybody back here on  Earth with their  binoculars looking at the  tail of the comet sees  it go boom, and you  take pictures of it as  you go on by. 
[00:51:30]  That's the kind of  public interest in what  we're doing, and this  married couple flying by  Mars will increase  tremendously, I have to  convince people that  are sure that we  should go back to the  moon this time to  stay, you know, it's  a wonderful statement,  but what it costs us to  do that, we can  lead, bringing the  nations together, and 
[00:52:00]  deciding where the base  is going to be, then  build the base with a  key element, an early  control center HAB module  for the interplanetary  craft, testing the  temperatures that are  very hot, very cold, and  the radiation that's on  the moon.  I think it's a problem  in that finances look at  so much, the cost of all  these things, but the  technology and innovation  for the people that 
[00:52:30]  comes out of the space  program, and these very  grand ideas, always  pays off, it always  winds up being better  for people here on  Earth.  Well, unexpected  things come along, and  we learn, as I  pioneered, that training  for space walking is  best done underwater in  a space suit with  neutral buoyancy.  Was that your idea?  No, not my idea, but I  welcomed it because I've  been a scuba diver for 
[00:53:00]  almost ten years.  Oh, you were?  Before then.  Now, why a married  couple, too?  Because literally, do  they have any experience  with sex or the  possible procreation in  space?  Is that something to do  with it, or just so  people could...  Why a married couple?  I'm not sure that  there's enough room in  that.  Well, there's a very  likely candidate of two  people that I know quite 
[00:53:30]  well, because we brought  them into our diving  group called the Sea  Space Symposium.  It's a couple that were  two years in Biosphere 2,  and they couldn't stand  each other, so they got  married.  But they head up a company  now that is building the  long-term life support  systems for the  government Orion spacecraft, 
[00:54:00]  which I don't know whether  it'll ever replace the  shuttle.  Now, back in 2009, we were  looking at this gap, if we  don't fill it, between our  replacement for the  shuttle, and when the  commercial guys will be  able to take things to the  space station, we're going  to have a gap, and we've  had one.  Yeah.  From the government, we  flew twice past the 2010  deadline, but what I 
[00:54:30]  proposed in 2009 was, with  2010 coming up pretty soon,  and I said, no, no, let's  fly the shuttle once a  year, and we can get  enough things done.  Now, in between, 30 months  before and after for that  particular orbiter, then  you've got six months in  between to be working on  the next program, whatever  it is. 
[00:55:00]  They didn't buy that, but  look at who predicted we  were going to have a  problem, and we had a  ready-made solution.  Yeah, and now we're, you  know, we're at the mercy  of the Russians, I  gather.  Well, we're financing  their space program.  Exactly.  I want to plug the  book today.  I'm sorry.  It's called, it is  called, I'm going to get  it absolutely right, it's  called Mission to Mars,  My Vision for Space  Exploration, and it is  out today, I believe, and  you can get it in  bookstores or at 
[00:55:30]  buzzaldron.com.  Just, you know, this  book explains, and you  got some great people on  the back.  You know, it's always  hard to get people on  the back to promote  this, but colonizing  space is essential for  the long-term survival  of the human race, and  this book shows us how  Stephen Hawking, so you  have some really legit  people on the back.  Well, he said we got  200 years to establish  an off-planet  habitation for the  survival of people  here in case of an  asteroid impact, nuclear 
[00:56:00]  war, pestilence.  there must be some  other  real tragedy.  Yeah, there's some  other bad stuff.  It is a great way to  kind of not have all  your eggs in one  basket, you know, and  if we do have the  technology and the  minds behind it, let's  see why we wouldn't do  well.  Well, I mean, just  think, the human race  originated on Earth,  either in the Garden of  Eden or crawling down 
[00:56:30]  from the trees, and  we've been here for  how long?  And now we are, we  will be a two-planet  system with growing  again with the  challenge of trying to  make that place  terraforming, they  call it.  It's pretty long-term  and rather impressive  things you've got to  do to sort of reverse  nature a little bit.  Sort of a shake-and-bake  planet.  Yeah, but Al Gore thinks  we've been reversing 
[00:57:00]  nature.  Oh, all right, yeah,  here on Earth.  What would you use for  energy when you're there?  Where would the main  source of energy come  from?  Well, I don't know  whether we can find  plutonium or uranium  there.  Nuclear, solar dynamic,  where you take and  focus the sun's rays on  on a focal point and  circulate a fluid through  there and compare that 
[00:57:30]  temperature with the  temperature on the back  that's not seeing the sun  that radiates outward to  the blackness of space.  Temperature difference is a  way of generating  electricity.  electricity.  You put electricity into  an air conditioner and  you circulate a fluid  around and you get  cold.  You take away heat.  Well, you can...  I'm exceeding my  knowledge of 
[00:58:00]  hydrodynamics and  thermodynamics, but  there's no doubt that  that works.  They compare the  surface water with the  cold water in Hawaii  and generate  electricity.  the surface  temperature and  geo, geotech, is the  temperature down where  it gets quite hot,  whether it's lava or  not.  And that's stored  energy for, you know,  that can be used.  Yeah, but it's, I  believe, more efficient 
[00:58:30]  than photovoltaic, which  is what China is beating  the pants out of us and  making it.  That's supposedly not very  efficient.  No, it's really hard  and it takes large  amounts of area and  construction in outer  space to be able to  beam that energy back  to Earth.  Yeah.  What kind of  psychological testing  to, like, there's got  to be some intense  stuff these guys have  to go through for  that type of...  They were telling me 
[00:59:00]  that we've got to rush  out of here when I'm  through to get to  CNN, so let's not  dilly-dally along if  we're doing...  You got CNN to do,  huh?  Yeah, busy guy.  I was reading something  about...  I mean, I hate to  dilly-dally, but I'm  reading something about  how the psychological  testing for the astronauts  for this type of long-term  travel is very, very tricky  because you don't know  how somebody's going to  respond after being  away from the Earth  for, say, a month or 
[00:59:30]  two months or a year.  Well, they've got tests  in Europe of a number  of people, candidates  for astronauts that  have been up there  for 500 days.  It's called Project 500.  And we put these people  in the biosphere.  I think a part of it  is to make sure that  you put a big time lag  in any communication  with who's running  the show.  But what the hell,  we get used to that  now with our iPhones.  We text somebody. 
[01:00:00]  We don't get an answer  right away.  It comes a little later.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes we send  a questionable photo.  Now, do you think  that we're better off  with space travel  with the government  handling, or is  privatizing it, do you  think, a better way  to go because things  tend to get done  a little bit faster?  Yeah, well, they  certainly do, and  they're historical  examples.  But I think, in general,  you can compete  at the design level. 
[01:00:30]  We can't always do  that with the government.  You take what you buy,  you compete at the  design level, and then  you make a selection,  and then you cooperate  with other people at the  operational level.  That you can do a little  better with the private  sector.  That's a good  compromise, yeah.  And you make an  investment, and you get  a return.  the government  doesn't get any  return at all, so the  motivation isn't quite 
[01:01:00]  there, especially if it's  a cost-plus contract.  That means you bid on  it, whatever it costs  you to make it, you get  reimbursed plus.  See, if so, if you run  way over, you get  reimbursed for all that.  How important was the  Cold War and the  motivation for the  lunar program, as  opposed to us needing  some kind of  motivation for this?  God, you're asking all  the good questions  here, and we're not  recording it.  I know, right?  Check one, two.  Yeah, I told you to  ask that. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Let me not answer  that, but use that  as a springboard.  Okay.  I believe that the  English-speaking  nations did a lot to  save the world from  tyranny in World War  I, and certainly World  War II.  Sure.  The Cold War, English-  speaking nations stood  up against the expansion  of communism in many  different places.  If anybody stems the 
[01:02:00]  spread of radicalism, it's  going to be the  English-speaking nations.  Certainly.  Okay, now, Russia and  China, they get along  pretty well.  They got different  language, they got  different symbols, and  they get together to do  what?  To thwart the U.S.  in what it's trying to  do.  So why shouldn't the  English-speaking nations  be a little bit more  cohesive?  Right. 
[01:02:30]  The technical language  a while back used to be  German.  Not anymore.  It's English.  The diplomatic language  certainly used to be  French.  Not anymore.  It's English.  We can get together  most of them, but  the really crucial  is India  and Asia.  And I think if we can  cultivate the  cooperation 
[01:03:00]  with Japan  and India  and the U.S.  involved in that,  Japan  wants to  really  sort of  concentrate  on  lunar landers  and ascent  vehicles.  Well, the Indians  could use that  kind of help.  We could, because  we don't want to  build those things  again.  But we got a few  things to land.  And when we get  all that ice  from the craters,  we got to get it  up into where 
[01:03:30]  the sun shines  all the time  at a refueling  depot.  Right.  And a global  consortia  of  commercial companies  can  finance that  cooperation  so the Japanese  launch the ice  to a fuel  depot  on the  nearside.  And is that  to get the  hydrogen out of  the water  for fuel?  Yeah, you  separate the  water into  hydrogen.  A fuel cell,  right, right.  Wow.  That's a great 
[01:04:00]  idea.  We have to  wrap up.  Oh, Buzz is  very busy.  But let's  promote the  book properly.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's called  Mission to Mars.  It's out today.  It's Buzz Aldrin,  my vision for  space exploration.  And it's just a  brilliant look at  how we're going to  get to Mars.  And there's  endorsement on the  back from Stephen  Hawking.  And you're the  real Buzz on  Twitter.  And you can go  to buzzaldrin.com  if you want to  find out more  about the book  or you want to  order it.  Or just go to a  bookstore.  Are you doing any  signings? 
[01:04:30]  Do you know?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Tonight?  Where are you doing  today?  We don't have that  list.  We can plug that  after you go.  We'll plug the  book signings.  We'll find that  out.  We don't have that  in front of us.  But Buzz will be  doing signings  probably here in  New York.  He's not doing  his shirt.  Oh, he's got the  real Buzz t-shirt  on under that.  It has a t-shirt  that says,  that's my Twitter.  The real Buzz.  That's your Twitter,  yeah.  The real Buzz on  Twitter.  And on Twitter.  And as soon as the  break is over,  we'll tell you where  you can meet Buzz  tonight for a book  signing in the coming  days.  Buzz, great to see  you here.  Thank you so much. 
[01:05:00]  heroes growing up  and it's fantastic.  I hope we really  see some of the  visions that you  put in this book.  Absolutely.  Thanks so much.  They're evolving  as we speak.  Yeah.  I add other  things.  I've got a  non-profit that's  promoting my ideas.  You're always  working.  Another non-profit  that's promoting  the exposure to  the American people  of space policy  over the years.  Yeah.  And from that,  we should learn  how to avoid  short-term  political decisions. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I think  people like you  that have done  such amazing  things for the  program are very  important for  people to see  and talk to you  and read what  you've written.  And I think it  keeps the space  program alive.  Yeah, we've got  to get them out of  here.  Buzz Aldrin.  Thank you very much.  This is the  OPN Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The OPN Anthony  Show is back.  The OPN Anthony  Show is back.  Go on, sit down. 
[01:06:00]  The celebrities  are ready to  entertain you  some more.  That's great. 
[01:06:30]  Hilarious.  I don't know.  I don't know what  just happened.  I gotta be honest  with you.  I try to get to the  bottom of his  bracelets.  He wouldn't answer  that question.  And then, what the  fuck happened?  I don't know what  happened on that.  We had a fascinating  interview with Buzz  second man to walk on  the moon, Buzz Aldrin.  He's 83 years old.  83 years young.  And he's got a young  girlfriend, by the  way.  Of course he does.  Why shouldn't he? 
[01:07:00]  He's Buzz.  Holy shit.  She couldn't have been  more than 45, I think.  More chippy.  Yeah, what's that?  I, you know, I adore  Jimmy Norton.  But there's just  something that I love  when you don't get what  you want.  Sure, I don't blame you.  There's something like,  oh boy, there it is.  And you see it every  day you show up for  work. 
[01:07:30]  God damn.  Yeah, I, I, I, I try  to get people.  He just fucking shut  you down.  Totally.  I try to get people,  because I want to  display these.  My thing.  So I try to get people  to sign the front of  my book.  The cover.  Which is no big deal.  No, it's not a big  deal.  It's really not a big  deal.  So I hand him a silver  sharpie.  Silver sharpie in the  book.  Buzz.  Yeah.  But you sign the 
[01:08:00]  front, and he goes,  no.  And he opens it up.  No, you sign the  inside.  He just says no to  Jimmy.  And he opens it up.  All right.  And then he realizes  he's signing it.  It's silver.  He goes, oh, it's  silver.  Tell me, you gave me a  silver sharpie, a pen.  Well, it says with the  color silver.  Look at it.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  But then I try to get  it.  And then I'm like, oh,  yeah, I like to display  him.  And he just closes it.  And hands it back to  you.  All right.  It's like five, five and  a half pages in.  He signs it with a silver  sharpie instead of the  cover, which it would 
[01:08:30]  have been great.  Buzz Aldrin, Mission to  Mars.  With a nice autograph.  With a nice Buzz  Aldrin in silver on the  cover.  Did he really, did he  really do it five and a  half pages in?  It's just, it's like.  It's the worst spot  possible.  Oh, one, two, three.  It's after that page.  And he signed mine too  in black sharpie, but  you know, it would have  been nice on the cover.  Why doesn't he sign the  cover?  What's the problem with  that?  I don't, I have one thing 
[01:09:00]  he wrote.  Obviously he has a problem  with that as well.  He's a grouchy guy.  He's really not a nice  guy.  But I have a, he's just  simply not.  But the reality is.  Why did he say don't  dilly dally?  What were we doing wrong  there?  It was a great question.  Of course, it was a  psychological testing.  It was a brilliant  question.  Oh, dilly dally.  Don't dilly dally.  And then a few times  he went like this, like  wrap it up, wrap it up.  So if you want to see  him and go, go to his  site and find his book  signings.  I ain't fucking  bugging him. 
[01:09:30]  But I will say this, you  know, for me to be rude  to Buzz Aldrin, I just  couldn't be.  No, he's an American  hero.  Yeah.  Like, believe me, that  exchange with anybody  else would have ended  unpleasantly.  But it's just like,  sometimes you just got  to shut the fuck up.  First of all, he's, um,  he's, he's an older  gentleman.  So, uh, you know,  he looks great for  him.  And I'm looking at his  rings and I'm like,  he's wearing girl rings  and girl bracelets.  There was one ring on  that was absolutely  something a girl would  wear.  Maybe it was something 
[01:10:00]  somebody made for him.  No, but it looked  like, I think it looked  like a half moon or a  crescent moon.  Oh, I saw that.  A crescent moon and a  little dot.  So that would be earth  obviously, but it's  something a girl would  wear, but obviously  feminine, but he  looked at it and said,  Oh, there's the  crescent moon and  earth.  I got to wear this.  That means something  though.  That's a moon man  fucking ring.  That's like everything  he wears is a moon tie.  Like everything he has  is like, like NASA.  I walk on the moon.  You think he, uh, you  think he likes the  moon or he loves the  moon. 
[01:10:30]  He's like, like, remember  how the guy, uh, what's  his name?  The plague Gilligan, Bob  Denver.  Sure.  Remember how he walked  around with the  Gilligan hat on all the  time?  Just so people go, Oh,  it's Gilligan.  Oh, it's Gilligan.  That's what Buzz does  with moon shit.  Right.  He just walks around  juggling moon rocks.  Well, wouldn't you?  He's got this moon tie  space helmet.  Nothing else you do  would matter.  You walk on the moon.  That's, that's your life.  You should, you should  kill yourself on the moon  after that.  And, uh, you know, I, I  make a hell of a steak on  the barbecue. 
[01:11:00]  Give us a fuck.  Oh, great, Buzz.  You're on the moon.  I, I, I, I, yeah, it's a,  I tweeted a picture of his  right wrist.  It's, it's old lady stuff  he's wearing.  And I try to ask him,  obviously it's some kind  of crystal thing, giving  him some superpowers, but  I guess he didn't want to  talk about it.  He, but he said, don't  billy-dally.  And he said, Anthony, you  asked the good questions.  I swear to you, I wanted  to ask when he was  talking, when you're in  space, does your hat  float off?  I couldn't do it without  laughing.  I could feel it. 
[01:11:30]  The last two minutes of  the interview, I'm just  looking down and trying  not to laugh.  But we should have, but  we should have just done  that.  Oh, he's, we're getting  a little soft.  No, I don't think he's  going with him.  No, not, not Buzz.  Buzz is one guy I can't  fuck around with.  There's the picture of  Buzz's, uh, how to  respect him.  Look at it, that's, that's  his right hand and his  wrist.  That's, that's stuff, I  swear to you, my mom  would wear.  It's Tiffany blue.  Like, that's something  that, but what is it?  Is it crystals for  superpowers?  Iraq wrote this, it's  something Mrs.  Mrs. Roper jewelry. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, look, CNN coming  up, Buzz Aldrin.  Yeah.  Ah.  Ah, let's see how CNN  handles that.  Yeah, it'll be different.  I just, I.  What a curmudgeon.  Yeah, he is a curmudgeon,  but again.  He gets a pass, man.  A guy like that really  does get a pass, whereas  most people, even actors  wouldn't.  Fucking actor, they, you  know, what do they do?  They get in front of a  camera and fucking act.  It's like, if they're  being nasty or fucking  curmudgeonly, you're like,  fuck you.  That guy, he's an  American hero.  You know, a national 
[01:12:30]  fucking hero.  Buzz Aldrin really did  a lot for humanity.  Yes.  You can't fuck with him.  So he gets a pass.  It was just funny to be  in it.  Oh, we could call him  out on being a fucking,  you know, a prick.  Iraq, what was your  favorite part?  I wouldn't be rude to him  personally, ever.  What was your favorite  part?  I kept just staring at  his jewelry, and he  kept doing this when he  would talk to Jim.  He would shake it and  point it into your face.  Yeah, and all the old  lady jewelry.  You'd hear like this  in the microphone, too.  As he was moving his 
[01:13:00]  hand.  Was that camera on at  the end when he wouldn't  sign the book cover?  No.  He turned it off?  Why?  Oh, we should leave it  on, yeah.  Until he left the  studio.  Yeah, he never  would turn the  camera off.  He wouldn't sign  Jimmy's down.  He didn't even want  to take pictures with  us.  No, the picture's like,  oh, he's walking  closer and closer to  the door.  Who's got the  camera?  Yeah.  Oh, I wish we  had that.  He wouldn't sign  Opie Sudoku.  He waved off the  Sudoku.  He waved off the  Sudoku.  I'm trying to get  famous people to sign  my Sudoku.  You almost got a  Buzz Aldrin Opie 
[01:13:30]  Sudoku no fucking  way.  I'm sorry.  Negatory on that  one.  And then I'm like,  well, I want to get  my book signed,  and I want to give  it to my brother  or something.  Keep it.  Why would you give  that away?  It's fucking Buzz  Aldrin.  But I didn't get it  signed, because Roland  goes, he's not signing  any more books.  He doesn't want to  sign it anymore.  No, he was done.  He was trying to wrap  the interview ten  minutes before he  was supposed to leave.  Yeah, but then he  started babbling more.  I know.  I fucking ran to him  to make sure I got  the book signed and  a picture pronto,  because I knew he 
[01:14:00]  wasn't fucking waiting  for shit.  He was waving off  all kinds of  signatures.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was going to try  to get him to sign  the cover with the  silver Sharpie just  to see Jim's face.  I would have been  funny.  I'm not that bent  out of shape, because  I do have a photo  with him that's signed,  and I have something  like a book he wrote  years ago, which is  just like a thing  of the moon in big  black, and I'm going  to sign it.  I have a beautiful  buzz signature displayed  in my house, so I  don't really care.  That's why it's more  funny.  You'd be out of your 
[01:14:30]  mind if you didn't  know that.  Hello, 11.  He refused to sign  Eric's photo.  Oh, he didn't sign  E-Rock's photo.  Why?  What happened, E-Rock?  Right as he was  leaving, I headed  outside, and I said,  could you sign that?  He looked at it,  and then just kept  walking.  Yeah, he doesn't  even say no.  That's the best part  of him.  He doesn't even say  no.  Maybe you'll remind  him of what he  landed on.  He specifically  told me five years  ago he doesn't sign  things with him and  the moon, so Eric,  you should have  known better.  No, he doesn't  sign things that he  hasn't written. 
[01:15:00]  That he hasn't  written.  Yeah, I know.  If he wrote it, he  would sign it.  He was very  apologetic last time.  What?  When he refused to  sign my photo.  I had a photo of  him on the moon.  Apologetic?  Then just sign it.  And he said,  you know, I'm sorry,  I'm trying not to  sign things that I  haven't written  anymore.  Why?  Who cares?  I guess he does  see a lot up on  you.  You're 83.  I can kind of  understand that.  But when you've  been interviewed by  a radio show and  people in that  studio, it's  different than when  you're walking  down the street.  I tell you, he  didn't want to  sign my fucking  photo of me and  him. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That New Jersey  thing.  Oh, that's your  old girlfriend.  That's my ex-girlfriend.  That story, yeah.  He was talking to  because he wouldn't  sign it.  He was such a  dick about it.  I asked him to  sign it.  It was me and  him.  And he goes,  ah, not right  now.  I'm like, well,  it's me and  you.  It was him and  his wife at the  time.  And he just  walked away.  So I was like,  fuck this.  So my ex-girlfriend  was with me.  And me and  Voss were inducting  Abbott and  Costello to the  New Jersey Hall of  Fame.  Horrible pool  owners association.  Yes. 
[01:16:00]  We were doing a  thing for  fences.com.  And she walks  over to me and  goes, give me the  picture.  I go, what?  And she goes, give  me the picture.  And she goes, he's  going to sign it.  So she takes it  over and walks  back a couple  minutes.  And I've told  this story before  and it was  signed really  nicely.  Buzz Aldrin,  Apollo 13,  blah, blah, blah,  blah.  He signed it,  whatever it was.  He signed it  really nice.  And I'm like,  what the, how  did you do  that?  And she goes,  well, this is  what her take on  it was. 
[01:16:30]  She said, look,  he's trying to  fuck me.  So I'm not  saying he was,  that was just  how she interpreted  it as a girl.  He was just  chatting.  Just say I had  to take his  rocket into my  crater.  His rocket spilled  rocket sauce in  my mouth.  But I guess they  were just chatting  and as a girl,  she interpreted  it like that.  But she said,  look, he wants  to fuck me.  And I said,  would you sign  something?  And he goes,  sure.  So she went  back with this  picture and he  goes, oh, you  got me. 
[01:17:00]  You got me.  And then he  goes, ah, a  little later.  And then his  wife just goes,  just sign it,  buzz.  I love that.  She's had it  with his nonsense.  Just sign the  goddamn thing.  After that,  after that,  all these people  kept asking him  to sign napkins.  You started  the train,  roll it.  Oh, fuck.  I wonder if  his whole demeanor  and his whole  life would have  been different if  he was the first  guy out of that  fucking lunar module. 
[01:17:30]  Do you think  that's what this  is all about?  Maybe.  It's, you know,  the fucking  middle child  syndrome.  Don't forget,  Neil Armstrong  became a recluse.  He really did,  yeah.  He was very,  very private.  It's a weird  thing with, like,  when you talk to  Buzz Aldrin,  it's like,  he's talking about  Obama.  Like, there's not  a head of state  he can't get  access to.  Right.  There's not a  head of state  in the world  that wouldn't  want him to.  They all have  to deal with  him.  Yeah.  It's the second  guy.  It's Buzz Aldrin.  These guys, too,  weren't, like,  actors and stuff.  I think there's 
[01:18:00]  this kind of  assumption that  if you get  popular,  you're going to  be famous,  you're going to  have to deal  with this shit.  These guys,  although they knew  there's fame  that came with  it, more  importantly,  it was this  mission.  You know,  they were just  fucking, you  know, either  Air Force or  Navy guys or  fucking, you  know.  How many guys  walked on the  moon officially?  Twelve.  It's up to  twelve.  A dozen  gentlemen.  And was it  determined that  Neil Armstrong  would be first?  How has that  worked out?  Or was it a  last minute thing?  I think it was 
[01:18:30]  just luck of the  fucking draw  mission.  Oh, there he  is.  He's saluting.  He didn't want to  dilly-dally.  I love that he  said dilly-dally.  He said dilly-dally.  Now, how was that  determined?  Did that ever come  out?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  They pull straws.  What do they do?  You're right,  draw straws.  No, I think NASA  just decides, you  know, hey, it's  going to be Neil  Armstrong, first guy  out.  He was the mission  commander, that's  why.  Yeah, I guess 
[01:19:00]  that's all it was.  Yeah, I guess  Armstrong was a  civilian at the  time.  Buzz was military  though.  Yeah.  Amazing though.  Goddamn, take this  rickety fucking  piece of machinery  and land on the  moon with it and  then get back.  Yeah, he gets a  pass for being a  prick.  Yeah, to be rude  to Buzz Aldrin,  even though he's  had guys be rude  to this, something  that just, like I  would tolerate a  good amount of  shit from him.  I really would. 
[01:19:30]  Honestly would.  It's just like,  sometimes you just  gotta fucking, you  know, you gotta be  respectful to a guy  like, I don't give  a fuck.  If he spit on me,  I'd probably object  to it.  Right, right.  But him just being  a little grouchy.  Him just being a  little grouchy, it's  like, the guy  fucking, he gave a  lot, man.  Yeah.  You know, he's a  fucking, he's a  man's man.  Dealing with that  divorce, it couldn't  have been fun  either.  Well, you know, you  just see her side of  it all of a sudden.  You kind of do,  right?  He fucking, he  probably just 
[01:20:00]  tortured her.  All those moon  photos are of him.  Every photo you see  of those iconic  pictures, that's all  Buzz, taken by  Armstrong, because  Armstrong had the  camera.  I think there's only  like one or two  pictures of Neil on  the moon.  Oh, there's, uh,  yeah, there's the  mission of Mars.  Let's see how it goes.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Awesome.  With those words,  Neil Armstrong, Buzz  Aldrin, Michael  Collins stitched  themselves into the  fabric of American  history.  Now, almost 44 years  after the U.S. won  the race to the moon,  famed astronaut Buzz  Aldrin is making his 
[01:20:30]  case for a new focus,  Mars.  In his new book out  today, Mission to  Mars, my vision for  space exploration, he  makes the argument for  continued space  exploration, both  robotic and human.  Author, veteran  astronaut, and space  advocate, Buzz  Aldrin joins us  now.  We're so happy to  have you this morning.  Thank you so much.  Well, thank you.  While you were kind  of reading that, I  thought, uh, uh, my  observation about  Philip Bond  Gardner, one giant  leap for Red Bull. 
[01:21:00]  So listen, Mars is  an asset priority.  We know that from  the chief.  That is very  important.  Um, we also know  that it's a priority  for you.  So why is it such a  priority?  Why should we buy  into having a human  on Mars?  Uh, humans on  Mars permanently is  the objective of  making humanity on  Earth a two-planet  system race.  race, sustaining of, uh, 
[01:21:30]  catastrophe here on  Earth, and inspiration to  our young people after  Apollo, the United States  was right up there in  science, technology,  engineering, and math.  Earth, okay?  We need that kind of  inspiration, and that  kind of commitment can  be made again when  50th anniversary of the  50th anniversary of the  70th lunar landings.  Atta boy.  Hey, you go to the 
[01:22:00]  moon, my lunch pole floats  away.  I stay here on the  job site.  The re-election.  We've got heroes right  here on the job site,  you know.  You go build everything  on the sun.  Obama.  And he, or she, will  need his help.  He's saying exactly  listen to the jury.  I want to read something  you wrote in the book.  You say America's the  chart of course of being  the national leader on  this international  activity to develop with  the moon, but not by  spending money of placing  U.S. government people  on its surface.  There's no need to spend  our money on landers and  other things that we've  done before. 
[01:22:30]  So where do you want to  see the space program  heading now?  Oh, no.  The space shuttle program  is retired.  It's all about colonizing.  Now he's going to go  about the space shuttle.  He just, it's about  two planets for the  world.  Space shuttle.  Now watch.  Well, a lot more goes  with that and has to  lead up to that.  For example, when I  submitted my choices for  the future in 09, I  didn't stop flying as the  accident board said and  as President Bush said 
[01:23:00]  about the shuttle at the  end of 2010.  I just said, let's fly the  shuttle once a year.  We've got a big gap.  He looks good on TV  though.  Buzz looks good.  He does.  Got color in his face.  Nice white head of hair.  It looks familiar,  doesn't it?  There were many  arguments about  retiring the orbiter.  I'm just saying that I  had the foresight to say  that we're going to be  financing the Russian 
[01:23:30]  space program to take  our people up to  $200 million.  These girls are like,  oh my God, what do we  do?  Well, that doesn't make  sense.  Get a word in.  Get a word in.  So thoroughly, 44 years  ago.  Get a word.  What is he making  change during the  interview?  Oh, that was it.  Good luck.  Good luck to have you  here.  Good luck.  Oh, you're so happy?  Oh, yeah, sure.  I'll sign the cover.  Thank you so much for  joining us today.  We're pretty good.  I don't know. 
[01:24:00]  That's when you did the  smiling, happy sign-off?  You phony.  You phony.  We gave you 25-minute  book plug.  They gave you 30 seconds.  Oh, my God.  They zipped right there.  You couldn't be happier  to sign it.  Sure, no problem.  We'll sign it wherever  you want.  He loves fucking ladies  is what it is.  He loves the ladies.  Let's go to Josh in  Boston.  Josh.  Hey, hey, how you  doing?  Oh, that. 
[01:24:30]  Josh.  Hey, I know I have a  holdup with him being  second on the moon.  He wouldn't sign the  paperwork with a purple  trappie.  All right.  I didn't hear you  say that.  That was good.  So there's our  Buzz Aldrin.  Oh, my God.  Perfect.  Moon rocks in a book.  Moon rocks in the book?  Apple falls. 
[01:25:00]  I hate Apple falls.  You don't like it?  No.  Apple falls.  Edgar stinks.  Just trying to be funny.  All right.  We're going to do  another break here.  Fucking buzz.  By the way, there's a  real buzz about  Grocery Man.  Yes.  There's an actual  buzz about it, huh?  Yeah.  I saw the little  illustration.  Pretty cool.  A couple different  illustrations of Grocery  Man and the tales of. 
[01:25:30]  Well, we'll have to get  into that after the  break.  Yeah.  And maybe some more  info on the Cleveland  thing.  And other things.  Sure, I'd be happy  to, ladies.  Could you see if he,  like, on camera,  takes it and starts  signing the cover  and looks right into  the camera and smiles?  No, you ought to  sign the cover.  You can display it.  You can display it  at home if you want.  I don't sign the cover.  Do you have a  Sudoku puzzle I can  sign?  Or maybe a picture  with me and you? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I'm a space cadet,  right, Ant?  You're listening to  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  Sirius XM.  Now, back to our show.  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  Now, back to our show.  Continuous.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  Continuous.  What a weird day. 
[01:26:30]  Buzz Aldrin.  Fucking rules.  Yeah.  Hey, Governor Christie  had the lap band.  Lap band surgery thing?  Really?  Remember the other day  I said, I go, I think  he's losing a little weight.  And now he's finally  admitting that he had  it all tied off.  In February, he had it  done.  So now it's going to  look really fucking  strange when he starts  dropping a lot of weight.  He's running for  president.  Yeah, of course.  That's the only reason  why he's doing it.  He can't have a big  fat president.  I didn't get a picture  with him when I met him. 
[01:27:00]  So I didn't know  who he was.  You didn't know  who he was?  How long ago was that?  Right before the election.  Now, could you imagine  if he becomes president?  You'll be like,  oh, I could have had it.  I was so stupid.  Yeah.  Well, what are you  going to do?  How much has he lost?  Has he...  Because you'd lose  the weight fast  with that lap band.  It's going to start  melting in front of  our eyes.  He's going to be  one of those  with that big fat head?  No.  It's going to look  like an Al Roker?  A lot of hangy. 
[01:27:30]  A lot of hangy skin,  I think.  And I think Reverend Al  had it done right.  There's no way  you get that then  without the lap band.  Reverend Al wasn't  as fat as him.  Reverend Al was a fat guy.  You forget how fat  he used to be.  Yeah, there was a picture.  He was a giant beach ball  at one point,  which was fucking...  Yeah.  On his Twitter,  he posted a picture  recently,  Reverend Al,  of him with...  I guess it was  at the UN or something  sitting behind Mandela  back in the old days.  And boy,  did he just look silly.  He looked silly.  With that hair  and he's big and fat. 
[01:28:00]  Did he have his  track suit on?  No, I think he was  wearing a suit  at the time.  Yeah, yeah.  This is going to turn  into a silly day.  It's great.  We're in a silly day.  How'd I miss that one?  Stupid guy with a track suit  and he didn't exercise.  There he is.  Look at that.  And he had to be  taken seriously  even back then.  He's got his big  fucking ravishing  Rollo hair.  And...  Look at this. 
[01:28:30]  Gives the appearance  that he's just pissed off  all the time.  No, he is.  But...  And that was, you know,  the days where he was  just out and about  causing trouble.  And now, you know,  MSNBC just hires him  like he's an actual,  I don't know,  reputable guy.  Talking head.  He's a talking head  over there.  He ruins every show  over there.  Yeah.  I don't watch MSNBC  at all anymore  because I couldn't  take it anymore.  Roll a bunch of  fuckwads over there.  I like to look at 
[01:29:00]  all the different angles  though.  Oh, boy.  But he's the type  of fucking guy  that just makes it  hard to look at  all the different angles.  That's a crazy angle.  That's a crazy angle.  Yeah, you throw  all those angles  in your brain  and you try to  make your own  fucking mind up.  Well, they were  talking about  the gun control issue,  which they do a lot  over there,  and they were  talking about  the fact that I guess  Donnie Deutch was  saying, yeah.  He said,  Just roll that  in bed.  If or when  there's another  school shooting  or mass shooting  that every one 
[01:29:30]  of these Republicans  and the Democrats  that voted against  the gun control  legislation,  and he said this,  will literally  have blood  on their hands.  Oh, really?  Literally.  Not knowing the way  to use literally,  I gather.  Well, a lot of people  literally have blood  on their hands.  No one knows  how to use literally  properly.  Yeah.  It's overused.  Vigorally is better.  It's overused  and it's always  used wrong.  Yeah.  Literally. 
[01:30:00]  Right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I miss NBC  a bunch of fucking tools.  More important,  Charles Ramsey,  as Travis put it  during the break,  is the gift  that keeps on giving.  He, uh...  He's the guy  that saved, uh...  Yeah.  that brought up  there in Cleveland.  What's her name again?  Amanda Burry, right?  Amanda Burry was  yelling and screaming.  She had a hand, like,  sticking out of the house,  I guess.  She's the daughter  of Blue and Dingle.  And Charles Ramsey  hears the commotion  and helps her get out  of that fucking  house of horrors. 
[01:30:30]  And, uh...  And now they can't  stop fucking interviewing him  because they know  he's gold.  We have to just find  every interview  Charles Ramsey has done.  We found another one  with a black reporter  that we're about to play.  Is there a remix yet?  Are there 20 remixes  out there yet?  This is from Fox.  Fox.  Fox 8.  Is it good?  Yeah.  I mean, I listened  to the first...  You asked me  to preview it.  It's two and a half  minutes long.  I listened to the first  30 seconds  and I stopped  and I said,  this is good.  Oh, okay. 
[01:31:00]  What channel  was this on?  This is on Fox  in Cleveland.  So Fox 8.  Local Fox.  Fox 8.  What, Fox Hungry?  Wow.  We all fell  for that one.  Here's Charles Ramsey.  Another interview.  Yeah, this is  Charles Ramsey, correct?  Yes, sir.  You live next door  to the home.  Yes, sir.  I talked to you earlier.  Can you tell  our viewers again  what happened?  I went to McDonald's.  I came home.  I meet my McDonald's.  I got the day  off from work  so naturally  you're doing nothing. 
[01:31:30]  And I hear  this girl screaming  and she's going nuts.  So I come outside  and I know  there's nobody  that's supposed  to be screaming  next door to my house  because there's no girl  that lives in that house.  So that's a day  to give away  if something's wrong.  And when I came  to the front door  and looked at her  she said,  my name is Amanda Bear.  Please get me  out of this house.  So I'm thinking,  whatever.  So I helped her  get out the house.  I ain't thinking  that you really  that girl that's missing.  You've been gone  for so long.  You know,  you think you lying. 
[01:32:00]  And she called  the police  and they came  and they took  a fingerprint sample  of her blood sample  and they came back  and it was her.  And then she said  it was two more  girls up in the house.  Now,  I don't know this.  I just helped her  move out.  You're correct.  I helped her move out.  And then a woman  named Michelle.  I helped her move out.  And you look,  it almost looks like  he said there's  two more bitches  in the house.  Two more bitches  in there.  It looks like he's  trying not to say  that idea.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you watch that  on the two more?  Because you know  his fucking lingo  when he's not 
[01:32:30]  in front of the camera  is a little different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm glad he did his hair.  And then she said  it was two more  girls in the house.  Now,  I don't know this.  Good call,  Billy.  You can see his lips  make a B.  They made a B sound.  Yes.  Two more bitches  in the house.  bitches  end up  in the motherfucker.  It came back  and then she said  it was two more  girls in the house.  Now,  I don't know this.  I just helped her move out. 
[01:33:00]  You're correct.  Eugenia DeJesus  was the other one.  and then a woman  named Michelle Knight.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So if you've been  next door,  I'll take you home.  He hasn't given a fuck.  And Michelle Knight  is like,  whatever,  whatever.  I don't know that nigga.  I don't know.  Charles Ramsey  fucking rules.  This is Buzz Ramsey.  Buzz Ramsey.  Best guy ever  to get involved  in this situation.  You're correct.  Eugenia DeJesus  was the other one.  And then a woman  named Michelle Knight. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  So you've been living  next door to that mouth  had you known  there were any people  No,  because I'd have pulled  this heroic stuff  last year.  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit.  He was there to go,  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit.  So far he wants to say  two bitches  and shit.  And shit.  He absolutely  was going to say shit.  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit  years ago.  Motherfucker.  Door to that mouth  had you known  there were any people  No,  because I'd have pulled  this heroic stuff 
[01:34:00]  last year.  With my goons.  With my goons.  Thank you for  restraining yourself.  Thank you for  restraining yourself.  So you realize  who it was  though.  Once she said  her name  you recognized  the name.  Pause,  he's lying.  In the last interview  he said he had  no idea.  Yeah,  of course.  This guy's story  will change.  He'll be more  the hero.  And he'll be  arrested for something.  I busted in there  motherfucker.  I put my guns out.  I sensed something. 
[01:34:30]  I sensed something.  Because I seen  he wasn't right,  this guy.  Yeah.  But he just lied  from the interview  to interview.  I'm black's  fucking super fly.  This guy is the best.  That's my neighbor,  Anthony.  And I say,  Anthony,  that's impossible.  What is last year?  He told me I was  paranoid because  I just moved  on the street  and I put him  something.  Oh my God,  now he's saying  he knew something  was up next door.  This guy is just  fucking going to  build it in time.  I love him.  He's going to be  a superhero by Friday.  Oh man,  I said, 
[01:35:00]  Anthony,  I put him on  my camp.  My spidey senses.  And then I walked  down the street  and I told my  neighbor,  Anthony,  and I say,  Anthony,  me and Anthony  talked about this  last year.  But he told me  I was paranoid  because I just moved  on the street  and I told him  something's wrong  with that house.  He told me  just leave alone.  Pause.  Pause.  Never.  He didn't say  any of this.  We've got to put  the interviews together.  In the one interview,  did you know  who it was?  Nah.  No.  Yeah,  I knew who it was.  And then I would  look at him,  you wouldn't think  anything out of it.  You wouldn't think  anything out of it.  Why were you having  barbecue with him? 
[01:35:30]  Having barbecue.  He was tinkering  with his car.  You never know.  He was just  normal guy.  I said,  I knew something  was up last year.  There was a fire.  Oh,  this guy's day.  There was a fire.  I got a feeling.  He rules.  All right,  we got those two.  We got to put  back to back.  Yeah.  Those two.  Did you know  the person that  lived there?  Yeah,  we all know him.  Don't say his name.  That was a good dude.  You know him.  Yeah.  But you thought  he lived there  by himself.  Yes.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  To hear some noises  coming next to you  don't make no sense. 
[01:36:00]  Because I know  you lived there  by yourself.  Police took him  into custody.  They said  they caught him  at McDonald's.  Because what I did  was gave him  I gave them  the description  of the car  that he was in.  And I guess  he drives a blue  Mazda Miata.  I think  I just confirmed  that as well  earlier.  Can you hear me?  I gave him  the description  of the car.  They never would  have caught that  nigga's 
[01:36:30]  for my ass  motherfucker.  Oh my god  this guy's gold.  Is there any more  interviews with him?  Two so far?  We should get him  on the phone.  Oh he is great.  Let's get Charles Ramsey  on the phone.  Oh he is gonna  be all over the place.  Changing his little stories.  Yeah.  Eric in Michigan  he sounds like  the husband of the  I don't got time  for that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've been saying  that old morning.  I got bronchitis.  Oh there's a fall.  Missing grandmother 
[01:37:00]  found dead?  What the fuck  happened to her?  You're kidding.  I don't know.  That guy is  fucking crazy.  He tells Ramsey.  They say you're  paranoid.  See I knew  that motherfucker  went up to no good.  He is a liar.  What an amazing  story though.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I guess the CNN  crews are gonna  have to get out  of Boston and  get to Cleveland 
[01:37:30]  huh?  Yeah.  Time to move on.  Time to move on  and get to Cleveland.  There's some shit  going down.  Amanda Berry.  Amanda Berry.  Yeah she looks  alright.  Maybe after you know  they give her a  makeover or something.  Right.  Before she goes  on the talk show  circuit.  You know that  Clinton tried to  get Zeppelin to  reunite for a  Sandy benefit?  Really?  And they said  hell no. 
[01:38:00]  Said go fuck  yourself?  Well.  Pretty much.  Apparently it's  kind of hard to do.  I think you're  being dead.  You've been on  this one though.  Robert Plant  just can't hit  those notes anymore.  Nah Robert Plant  he doesn't want  to be embarrassed  out there.  Yeah everyone  wants to hear  Zeppelin the way  you hear it on  the record.  Right.  And he just  can't do it.  There's so many  great Zeppelin  cover bands  out there.  You assume  a president  ex-president  goes to you  though.  You almost  would have to  say alright  fuck. 
[01:38:30]  He asked us.  Yeah.  But they said  hell no.  We will not  reunite.  Now you get  the fuck  out of here.  Right.  Yeah it's  over.  Zeppelin's  done.  Please.  I still could have  done it for the  her daughter  that appears  to have been  created by a  sexual assault  or rape  and this man  Charles Ramsey  walking by  didn't turn his head  and say I don't  want to get involved  he jumps up on  the porch  he breaks down  the door  and gets her 
[01:39:00]  out  gets her to  911.  There's two  heroes  and these  women are alive  because of  Charles Ramsey.  It's fantastic.  John I remember  with the Dugards  in retrospect  there were people  who said  there were girls  kept in the  backyard  and the  neighbors  no one ever  stepped forward  the cops  checked it out  but they  weren't able  to find  anything  meanwhile  there were  girls inside  there kept  for years  what are your  early indications  and investigations  showing  were there  people who  were suspicious  all about  this house  well let's 
[01:39:30]  talk about  J.C.  Dugard  for a minute  he you know  neighbors made  complaints  and parole  and probation  officers and  sheriffs  went into that  house  and Philip  Garrido  who was a  level 3  sex offender  who had been  convicted of  kidnapping a  girl and  beating her  severely and  keeping her  in a storage  unit that  he was actually  arrested and  went to jail  for a month  for parole  violation while  his crazy  mother I  mean sorry  his crazy  wife kept  J.C.  in the  backyard 
[01:40:00]  now if I  was the  cop that  came to  arrest him  for violation  I would  have searched  the whole  house went  out in the  backyard etc  so I think  law enforcement  can learn  something from  this to take  these calls  very very  serious  god can  you imagine  they were  that close  and they  didn't find  it  that's the  dugard case  where they  were living  in the  backyard  in that  structure  or whatever  and he  had a  parole  violation  so they  sent him  to jail  and the  fucking  wife  watched the  captive  didn't set her  free or  nothing  and the fact  that he 
[01:40:30]  kidnapped a  girl and  beat her  and then was  on parole  yeah yeah  that's just  and they were  so close to  finding what  was going on  in that  residence  but they  didn't check  the whole  place  from top  to bottom  wow  can you  imagine  being those  people  knowing that  the cops  are right  outside  and just  waiting  going alright  it's a matter  of time  they're going  to get to  where I'm  at and they  never do  yeah  fuck  jeez  oh there's  Charles Ramsey  where are the  tissues  I need tissues  we supposed to have  tissues every day  in here  every day 
[01:41:00]  just like our  microphones  that we speak  into  we should have  tissues that we  blow our nose  into  every day  no we just  didn't we say  this recently  again  yes  yes  and then we  wound up  sounding like  whiny assholes  because  divas  we're fucking  asking for  tissue divas  but when you're  broadcasting  you need a  clear  clear nasal  passages  or else  it's not  like  hi  who sets up  the studio  I don't know 
[01:41:30]  interns and  Eric  so how come  we asked for  the tissues  to blow  your nose  yeah  it's very  important when  you're broadcasting  Iraq  how come  there's no  tissues in here  comment  there usually  are  I know  where are they  like a silver  box that's  always put  near Anthony  there's never  any tissues  in here  I've heard  this conversation  ten times  there's never  tissues  what the fuck  look at these  tissues  can you go  get a  where are the  fucking tissues  fucking  there's  fucking  three tissues  in here 
[01:42:00]  three dusty  puffs  three dusty  puffs of  tissue  when I  blow my  nose  there's  a lot  of  snot  and it's  obvious  that they  put the  tissues  back in  the box  but it's  like this  was one of  those things  that was  discussed  like hey  can we  have this  yeah  they need  to buy  tissues  keep them  and you  know  make sure  a fresh  box of  tissues  are in  here on  a daily  basis  you think  the sponsors 
[01:42:30]  want to hear  their reads  done in  nasally  fashion  I don't  think so  I have some  Charles Ramsey  comparisons  oh good  yeah  let's do  Charles Ramsey  comparisons  also we're  trying to call  the guy  but his  voicemail box  is full  I bet  yeah I would  assume  but we got  his actual  number  that's kind  of cool  all right  so first  we're going  to listen  to his  first interview  that we  listened to  this morning  just a part  of it  yeah just  just a part  of it  and then we're  going to listen  to the interview  that we just  played on Fox  okay  see if there's  any discrepancies  yeah  that's my idea 
[01:43:00]  of course  and this is  Jim Norton's idea  this is Jim Norton's idea  comes out  with a little girl  and she says  call 911  my name was  Amanda Berry  did you know  who that was  when she said  that  when she told me  it didn't  register  until I got  to call  911  and I'm like  I'm calling  911 for Amanda Berry  I thought this girl  was dead  okay  and then he said  this on Fox  so I'm thinking  whatever  so I helped her  get out the house  I ain't thinking  that you really 
[01:43:30]  that girl  that's missing  you've been gone  for so long  you know  you think you lying  and she called  the police  and they came  and they took  a fingerprint sample  of her blood sample  and it came back  it was her  wait they cut  the part off  there  no  first time  he says  I didn't think  about it  until I called  911  second time  he says  when I'm getting  her out of the house  I'm thinking  no you're not  this person  but doesn't the guy  say did you recognize  the name in the second  interview  yeah yeah  that's true  and then she said  it was two more  girls up in the house 
[01:44:00]  no I don't know this  I just helped her  move out  you're correct  it was Gina DeJesus  and then a woman  named Michelle Knight  so you've been living  next door to that house  had you known  there were any people  nah  because I don't pull  this heroic stuff  last year  to my groom  yeah there's a part  of that interview  where he asked him  to recognize the name  oh you left off  the last part  of the second interview  so you realize who it was  though  once she said her name  you recognize the name  yeah  yeah no doubt 
[01:44:30]  all right now  okay  we're gonna see  if he had any suspicions  oh  that something  was  was a lot  in this other house  first interview  every day  I mean  every day  how long have you lived here  I've been here a year  okay  you sure I'm coming from  I barbecue  with this dude  we eat ribs  and what not  and listen to salsa music  you sure I'm coming from  and you had no indication  that there was anything  hey bro  not a clue  that that girl  was in that house 
[01:45:00]  or anybody  okay  and then he said  this on fire  street  and I told my  my neighbor  Anthony  and I say Anthony  me and Anthony  talked about this last year  but he told me  I was paranoid  because I just moved  on the street  and I told him  something wrong  with that house  this motherfucker  Charles Ramsey  would make a horrible witness  I told you  there's something wrong  with this house  5.52pm  34  Eric says  I haven't listened to this  you just sent it to me  Eric says that this is  Charles Ramsey's 911 call

[01:53:00]  what's up with big ball guy  or big balls guy  does he have both balls?  man has surgery for 134 pounds scrotum?  he walks around  now he's sitting on some type of bus here  right  and a public you know bus  and he carries around a plastic milk crate  you know those milk crates  with a pillow  and he's got to sit on the chair  and then in between his legs  he puts the milk crate upside down  with the pillow on it  and rests his gigantic 134 pound ball bag  on the milk crate and pillow 
[01:53:30]  wow that's a huge fucking ball  he wasn't born this way  what a burden  it just started growing  for five painful years  Wesley Warren Jr. watched as his scrotum  slowly swelled  into a 134 pound mass  that hung to his ankles  alright get Dr. Steve  well why the fuck  wouldn't he  stop when it was like  well maybe it'll get better  when it was like  80 pounds  it's like  if it's  if the diameter of your ball bag  increases by like 
[01:54:00]  an eighth of an inch  how about you go to the doctor?  but there's a lot of wiring down there  how do you take care of that?  he recalled a mid-sleep maneuver  that slammed his right testicle  I felt the most enormous amount of pain  that one could possibly imagine  and then it just starts growing  from that point?  the pain quickly subsided  as if a big rig was rolling off his scrotum  right  I felt like I dodged a bullet  oh big rig  the following day  the sack had stretched  to the size of a soccer ball  so did he go  he's not saying  I went to the ER  and they treated it  as though I had some kind of infection 
[01:54:30]  uh antibiotics  went to other doctors  no one was able to figure out  anything for me  oh please  they would refer me to other doctors  because I don't have insurance  or the financial means  to pay for these  folks on demand  the appointment  would be six weeks away  or three months away  blah blah blah  he lives off disability  you think  yeah  and who's gonna hire him  he had help  quite the distraction  at the workplace  yeah  look at his ball bag  right  Jesus  he got donations 
[01:55:00]  from a show down the hall  what  he turned to radio host  Howard Stern  for help soliciting donations  oh he did  wow  what  and he got money  apparently  apparently people sent him  sent him money  did Howard make him show it  I don't know  I think uh  I think he just did a phoner  I would've  ooh  nah you got some set of balls on ya  ooh  oh Dr. Steve will be calling us  to talk about big balls  in five minutes  yeah  alright  because he's dropping his children off 
[01:55:30]  oh okay  I would've said to the guy  you're nuts  that's pretty good Chip  I know  oh 13 hour surgery  so what is he down to now  for what  like what  to remove  the 134 pound mass  but what was the mass  and how did he get it  just by rolling over  in his sleep  nah he rolled over  in his sleep  and it  it fucking  that's when he realized  he had something going on  down there  something ruptured  it's a kind of fluid collection  flood  no he already had something  growing  and when he maneuvered in bed  it  it exposed it to him 
[01:56:00]  yeah  yes  lymphedema  what is it  lymphedema  lymphedema  scrawler lymphedema  scrawler lymphedema  is what happens  when your scrotum grows  build up of fluid  fluid  the mass  and tissue  tissue  it will knit itself  into the fabric  of your scrotum  you know those things  you can't get on the show  tissue  tissue  I don't even know you  yeah  hey this is what you get  when you wash your neck  you get Kleenex  Dr. Steve Chipperson 
[01:56:30]  or something  fluids or something  yeah it's a big mass  or something  you know a bunch of  people in church  inside of your scrotum  or something  you don't like Dr. Steve Chipperson  no  who would  flood  yeah a bunch of  fluid  wow that's 
[01:57:00]  I hate those stories  you gotta like  grab your  you gotta grab your  balls when  you're hearing  these stories  I don't know why  grab yours  ow  I like that  yeah  bad  his bag  must have  said  oh my god  what happened  you know that feeling  you're getting your  balls when you go  in a car  like  and you're going  over a hill  where you're going  downhill  and then  it goes uphill  really quick  like it sinks  back into you  what is that  I gotta ask Dr. Steve  that 
[01:57:30]  why do you get a  feeling in your  ball bag  when you go  down a hill  and then back up  like that  what is that  well it's basically  it's just sinking  back  and it's gravity  kind of pulling you  back towards the  center of your  own gravity  which would be  where you're  seated  I don't buy  that  yeah  because it's  when you go  up and over  a hill  or when you go  down and up  so you're getting  the  the increase  in G's  and negative  G's on your 
[01:58:00]  ball bag  doc  you don't have  any H's  or I's  or something  no  sus  sus  ah  yo we got  I got a  mustache  sus  that's when  you have  a bunch  of mushers  and you hide  them somewhere  sus  sus  we got a guy  that had this  in the 8th grade  oh stop  Jim in Philly  what do you got 
[01:58:30]  big balls  yeah it's called  testicular torsion  oh  and the same  shit happened  to me like  it was like  the summer  of 8th grade  and I woke  up one morning  and  my balls  do imitations  it's testicular  gorsion  it's an old  joke  yeah it's funny  though  it feels like  you get hit  and the ball  is like  just all  fucking day  and then  yeah  mine didn't  get like  a soccer ball  I mean  I would definitely  collect donations  at that point  but like  I got  at least  like a softball  don't they also 
[01:59:00]  call that  like a twisted  yo-yo  or something  yeah  like  your ball  your testicles  in your sack  they are connected  obviously  they don't just  sit there  like click clacks  they're connected  with some fucking  you know  tubes and shit  but they have  to be  able to  drop down  or suck  back up  so it actually  is like a little  yo-yo thing  and that  little array  of stuff  that holds  your balls  there  it can sometimes 
[01:59:30]  twist  and kink  like a hose  like a kinked  hose  and that  fucks up  your fucking  balls  and yours got  up to the size  of a softball  what do they  do for you  well  it was  the worst part  was that  my grandparents  were ever  watching me  so I  had to go  to my  fucking  you know  80 year old  grandma  and say  hey you know  like  I think  something's  wrong  down there  and you know  it was bit  by a snake  grandma  you gotta  suck  the poison  out  well then  why are you  putting it  in my ass 
[02:00:00]  to get it  ready for  your mouth  that guy  just calls  in  to help  the show  out  and then  he's fucking  his grandma  in the ass  and then  the mouth  grandma  exactly  pull those  teeth out  I guess  we don't care  what happens  to you  but do you  have normal  balls now  well I mean  that's the  shitty part  because once  they expand  to like  a softball  I mean  they don't  grow back  to it's like  losing a lot  of weight  at once 
[02:00:30]  so you got  some wrinkled  you got half  a Hulk bag  you got a lot  of skin down  there  you got a lot  of skin down  there  like a deflated  basketball  or something  there you go  that fucking  blows  when someone  says slap me  five  give me some  skin  right  you just throw  your balls  or something  I said  slap me  stop  I love it 
[02:01:00]  all right  Jim  thank you  we got the man  himself  online  dr steve  we got a story  we got a story  of a guy  his fucking  balls  or his scrotum  got up to  134 pounds  nice  and he said  he moved  in the middle  of the night  and fucking  felt in  incredible pain  I guess he  what  twisted the wrong  way or something  and that's what  he's claiming  caused this  which I doubt 
[02:01:30]  very much  yeah  yeah that's called  massive scrotal edema  what the fuck  but a lot  of times  it'll happen  when the  venous supply  of the  scrotum  is blocked  so here's the  thing  veins  are  very compressible  thin wall  vessels  whereas arteries  are muscular  and hard to  compress  so if you get  some compression 
[02:02:00]  of the vein  then the  arteries can  still pump  blood in  oh man  what a fucking  balloon  yeah it's  it's just  a you know  a hydrostatic  situation  where you've  got water  pumping in  and it can't  come out  and so it  just pumps  these  this scrotum  which is  already  pretty loose  and elastic  and it just  gets bigger  and bigger  and bigger  it will stop  when the  pressure pushing  in  equals the  pressure  pushing out 
[02:02:30]  but with  the scrotum  that takes  a long time  it can get  huge  oh my god  so when they  say they  removed the  mass though  is it just  flood  or is it  probably stretching  the shit  out of stuff  in there  right  yeah there's  the testicles  are still there  but they don't  grow  inside that  giant sack  there will be  two  probably  atrophic  little testicles  yeah  you get that  if you come  in second place 
[02:03:00]  something  a lot of  the tissue  in there  will become  just sort  of  boggy  and there  won't  there might  not necessarily  be a lot  of free  fluid  although  there  may well  be  you know  and one  that size  he's probably  got a few  gallons  of fluid  as well  as just  tissue  that's  you know  boggy  and enlarged 
[02:03:30]  swollen  and fucking  like  impregnated  with fluid  yeah  oh  that's  disgusting  so how  do you  take care  of this  surgery  is the  only  option  on that  compression  will actually  make  does everyone  get soaked  in the  operating  room  oh yeah  wait  compression  will do  what  compression  will just  make it  worse  like  people  think  well  you  got  a swollen  leg  you put  them  in a  compression  stocking  but  compressing  swollen  ball bag 
[02:04:00]  will actually  make the  problem  worse  so you  can't jump  up and down  on it  sometimes  people  can't  you  get  torsion  of the  testicles  will cause  torsion  of testicles  where you  twist the  cord of  the testicle  so much  that it  cuts off  the blood  supply  and that's  a surgical  emergency  but usually  doesn't cause  a scrotum  that's  you know  14 pounds  or 40 pounds  or whatever  you could  probably lose 
[02:04:30]  a testicle  that way  if it's  not receiving  nourishment  absolutely  jesus  this guy  got it  up to  134  pounds  you chicks  think it's  fucking  your tits  are a  problem  jesus christ  got these  fucking balls  hanging down  imagine trying to  walk around  with that shit  hanging between  your legs  oh my god  you have to  bounce on  them or  something  i really 
[02:05:00]  think i  like this  wow dr steve  that's  terrible  you want  to take  ball bag  questions  right now  yeah sure  freaking out  everybody  we got a  guy  rocco  in jersey  needs to  talk to  you  immediately  rocco  what's up  dr steve  44  i got 
[02:05:30]  big sack  of varicose veins  i mean i think  for me they're  big  you know  they hurt  when someone  touches  like my wife  touches them  maybe chip  could touch  them  anyway  what do you  suggest  okay i  missed  he's got  a big  ball sack  full of  varicose veins  oh okay  yeah if you  read a lot  of people  will have  that  there are  veins  around the  testicles  that draw  the heat  away  you may 
[02:06:00]  know that  you can  only make  sperm  if the  testicles  are three  to six  degrees  below body  temperature  and so  there's like  a heat  exchanger  which is  you know  this plexus  of veins  around the  testicles  that draws  heat away  back up  into the  body  and you  can get  varicose veins  there just  like you  can anywhere  else in the  in the  you know  in the lower  extremities  and when you  reach down  there and feel  it'll feel  like a bag  of worms  just can't  go fishing 
[02:06:30]  with them  now  when that  happens  they lose  their heat  exchange  capability  and so  people with  varicose  seals  which is  what that's  called  will very  often be  infertile  and the  only way  that this  can be  treated  if you  want to  treat it  is to  have a  urologist  strip away  those veins  now dr steve  you're talking  about like  the temperature  of the ball  bag that's  kind of why  it hangs  down there  so it's  like you 
[02:07:00]  know it's  like an  air-cooled  little engine  now if  i wear  like socks  on my  ball bag  you know  just pull  and keep  it real  warm  would it  not  is that  a good  form of  birth  control  what's  not  reliable  form of  birth  control  but it  would  affect  your  sperm  count  over  time  yeah  if i  fuck  a  girl  and i  have  like a  100  watt  light bulb  and i  lay my  balls  on them  as i'm  pounding  away  problem  yeah it 
[02:07:30]  would look  like your  balls just  had a  great idea  wow that's  something  yeah that's  a crazy  fucking thing  to have  varicose  fucking  veins  and you'd  be infertile  yeah  so i guess  you have to  move out of  fertile  so i guess  another town  or something 
[02:08:00]  yeah wearing  a little  thin there  yeah  i guess i'm  wearing thins  yeah because  it's really  nice outside  yeah  thank you  rocko  we're gonna  move on to  the next  ball bag  problem we  got louie  in westchester  louie you're  on with dr  steve  yeah  what's going  on guys  amen  dr steve  i got a  i got a  black little  spot in the  middle of my  ball bag  oh boy  he got  he got a 
[02:08:30]  what  you heard  a black  spot  you heard  him  oh a  black spot  oh okay  um is it  painful at all  uh not  really  okay and is it  raised a little  bit like there  might be a little  something under  the skin there  uh possibly  maybe i'm  feeling it right  now  oh i feel a  little raised  how big is  it uh it's  not very big i  would say the  size of a  small pimple  your cock  no no  there uh the 
[02:09:00]  ball bag is  real uh  uh or it's  very prone to  developing little  cysts there  if you look at  your if you're  nutsack you may  see these little  white spots all  over the place  those are called  four dice  pods which are  actually what are  they called  four dice  thanks  i was gonna do  that  they are uh 
[02:09:30]  little uh  sebaceous glands  little oil glands  and every once  in a while one  of those things  will get really  clogged up and  cause a black  hit  ladies don't get  too turned on  with this  discussion about  our fucking  zitty ball  bags  cities  this one's  for you  this one's  for you  yeah  it doesn't  look like a  black hit  though  okay okay  if it's  black and  it's on your  skin and 
[02:10:00]  it's not a  black  you're unemployed  what  wow  uh just  to uh  either a  dermatologist  or a urologist  let them take a  look at it  those kinds of  things are the  hardest thing to  diagnose over the  air  uh oh  you know what  that means  oh boy  you know what  that means  i don't want a  piece of that  yeah he doesn't  want any  responsibility  i'm just saying  if i could see  good luck with  the chemo  immediately but  yeah  you know  you can get  um little  vascular uh  changes of the 
[02:10:30]  skin in the  ball bag too  because the  skin is so  thin you get  a little uh  thing called  a hemangioma  oh  it's all this  stuff would you  get  i'd have to  taste it to  get a diagnosis  it's a  hemangioma  is a collection  of capillaries  and they're  usually red  but every once  in a while  one will clot  off and it  will turn  black  oh  that may be  what it is  and uh  but i  definitely get  it checked  any black  lesion on the  skin needs to  get checked  oh  all right  thank you  let's move  on to uh 
[02:11:00]  this is a  terrific segment  here why don't  we move on  to um  steve in  massachusetts  he's got uh  three testicles  dr steve  steve  i'm actually  looking for uh  chip's opinion  okay  what does chip  think  what's your  question  i have uh  three balls  well kind of  two two and a  quarter balls  oh  yeah  yeah  let's yeah  what's your nickname  like the three  bald wonder or  something 
[02:11:30]  yeah  he loses  air lap  that's the best  it was just such  a disappointment  it really was  after riding so  high  like i knew he  had his hopes up  for a really good  chip one  and chip just  lets you down  every time  chip gave you  nothing  so steve you got  two regular balls  and one that's a lot  smaller making uh  the third yeah it's  like a two and a 
[02:12:00]  half men's show or  something since  now  yeah  yeah  yeah  what do you think  what is what  what causes that  dr steve have you  heard of this  sure it's most likely  a collection the  third testicle is  most likely a  collection of fluid  yay  that's his catch  phrase  uh if you take a  pen light and put  it behind that  third testicle and  if it lights up like  gt's finger it's  most likely a clear  collection of fluid 
[02:12:30]  called a hydrocele  hydrocele  they can't bounce  the ball in its  nose or something  and if you just let  your doctor take a  look at it they can  usually tell if that's  what it is those  things don't have to  be removed uh if  it's not if they're  not bothering you  now if it's opaque  then it needs to be  uh evaluated with a  testicular ultrasound  oh boy  they can usually tell  whether it's a  problem or  what are the odds 
[02:13:00]  it's uh part of his  dead brother that  never fully developed  a joint twin that  only it's a little  face on it  gotta go through  life with his one  little testicle  imagine that he  shines the light  through it and it  goes help me  it starts talking and  looking around  oh your little  brother in your  ball bag  don't dilly-dally  we need the answer  love you guys  long time  oh everyone's  talking  all right thank you  it's a long time  listener  i appreciate it  bye dr steve  dr steve  thank you buddy  oh am i leaving

[02:41:00]  Or  No it was a girl  A girl  She would just blurt out  Nigger  That's wonderful  For everybody involved  Yeah  Jesus  They'd have to be like  No she's got Tourette's  Oh god  Yeah  She was diagnosed with  Cumia-itis  A mild case  Yeah of course  We got a Tourette's story  It's a little old  But we haven't done it yet  Michael Doyle  And Chaz Petaway  Are friends  And travel companions  Were booked on a jet blue flight  From Washington  To San Juan  Puerto Rico 
[02:41:30]  Thursday  To take part in a weekend  Revolutionary war  Reenactment  Oh no  It was  A really big deal for us  It was gonna be  It was gonna be fun  Yeah  Very fun time  Doyle says he was not allowed  To board his flight  Does that sound like fun?  To anyone in the room?  No  It's more fun  Watching this guy  In the Revolutionary War  The British are coming  Ah  Pussy lips  What?  What?  What do we got here?  What is that? 
[02:42:00]  Oh it's David Allen Greer  It's posse  D.A.G  It's kind of like  A makeup gal  And everything  With him  D.A.G  All right  Nice match  Because of his Tourette's  But they'd planned ahead  With a letter  And phone calls  Alerting JetBlue  And the TSA  About his so-called  Ticking  Frequent outburst  Vocalizing  Thoughts  He's trying  To suppress  With all the stuff  In the news  About the Boston  Bombings  And stuff  I  I started taking bomb  Because that  When I get nervous 
[02:42:30]  And anything on my mind  Will come out  So  And the things  You're not supposed to say  It's true  I don't get it  Nah you know  I don't believe  Because in the end  You could kind of  Can't you  I don't know  If you're going  Bomb  Bomb  You know what  Don't get on the plane  Sorry  Sorry  But can't you just  Somehow just  You know  Just change it  As it's coming out  I don't know  That's so weird  Yeah 
[02:43:00]  Attack something on the end of it  I don't know  Bomb ski doodle  That's a rough one  For everyone involved  You know  Most people hate flying  To begin with  And then you got a guy  Yelling bomb  While you're on the plane  He's yelling cunt  And bomb at the same time  Bomb cunt  Bomb cunt  Ah ladies you cunt  Pots you cunt  Bomb cunt  That's good  Lovely flight  I paid for this ticket  We don't even deal  With someone hitting  The back of our seats  No 
[02:43:30]  By accident  We're going to deal  With a guy yelling bomb  The whole flight  No fucking way  It didn't cause any issues  At passenger screening  We went through TSA  Sang bomb the whole time  And no one  Stopped us  No one said anything  Because  They were aware  I love how they're annoyed  Yeah  Seriously  Yeah  You picked the wrong word  They were aware  But just minutes before boarding  The JetBlue pilot  Put the kibosh on the trip  To me it looks 
[02:44:00]  You know  Like it was  Kind of discrimination  You know  In a statement  To Fox 5 News  JetBlue officials say  Doyle was quote  Deemed a safety concern  By the pilot in command  After using the word bomb  After further investigation  The situation was deemed innocuous  It doesn't make up  For the embarrassment  Or the fact that we missed  Or the fact that we missed  Something we've been planning  For two years  Too bad  Too bad  Sorry  This is one  The pilot is right  It's like  Too bad about  You're embarrassed  Aren't you embarrassed 
[02:44:30]  To walk around  Yelling bomb  In the fucking airport  They have the right  To go  You know what  No one else is allowed  To yell bomb  On the airplane  Take a pill  Take a fucking  Shut your mouth pill  Yeah  Kind of still makes people nervous  When they hear bomb  Yeah  Maybe it is a disability  But I say your disability  Was you flailed your arms  Wildly in a circle  I can't help it  My arms are flailing  In a circle  And I can't stop  Would they have to 
[02:45:00]  Let you on the plane  And sit next to somebody  Right  That would be  Imagine he's the only one  That actually saw a bomb  But no one believes him  Oh my god  It's your Tourette's  It's his Tourette's  Nobody would buy it  No  Tourette's was  Discovered over 200 years ago  And we still don't have a cure  Marla Gabala  Is chairman of the  Tourette's Syndrome Association  Of Greater Washington  Has two teenage daughters  With Tourette's  One of the biggest misconceptions 
[02:45:30]  Is that they can't stop doing it  And the perfect way  To think about it  Oh by the way  Can you pause  How great is that  Teenage girls with Tourette's  You'd never think  They were telling the truth  Uncle fuck me  Uncle fuck me  Oh your daughter's a lot  Who's talking right now  Cock and butt  Oh that Tourette's  It's so annoying  Stop it  No he did  Cock and butt  She's just talking normally  No really he did  Nah cock and butt  Cock and butt  Think about it 
[02:46:00]  When you have Tourette's Syndrome  It is a tick  It is an involuntary response  Exactly like a sneeze  One that Doyle says  Leave scars that run deep  I mean this has happened  Multiple times in my life  And it's  It's just  It hurts  Aw  Michael Doyle says  He was offered  A free round trip ticket  On another JetBlue flight  But no guarantee  This wouldn't happen again 
[02:46:30]  Exactly  Chaz says he decided  To stay behind  Out of loyalty  To his friend  Aw  Doyle did have  Profane outbursts  During our visit  But none that crept  Into the critical points  He was making  During our interview  You should have  Fucking  Bob I have to ask you  A question  I know a lot of people  Probably have  Misconceptions about Tourette's  You know I think  I love a good  Profane outbursts  Profane outbursts  Why would you show that  Even though it has  Nothing to do with  The story that you're  Getting to the bottom of  That I want to see  Yes  The outbursts  Would be beautiful  Yeah  Pictures about Tourette's 
[02:47:00]  You know I think  People assume  That it just happens  All of the time  And during your interview  I know it was edited  But it didn't really  Come out  I guess the way  People perceived it  There was one word  We had a silence  At one point  You couldn't even tell  But they're little things  In fact  After I called  And showed up at the house  He kept saying  Bob Barnard  Bob Barnard  He was excited  That I was there  And his mother  And grandfather  Said they'll probably  Be hearing my name  For a couple of weeks  Who the fuck  Wants to deal with  This kid  Bob Barnard  It's a fucking asshole  Yeah Bob Barnard  Bob Barnard  Fuck Heine 
[02:47:30]  Bob Barnard  Fuck Heine  Fuck Heine  God damn  I would hate to have  Tourette's on a plane  Why  Just start yelling  Yeah  Yeah just stop there  Just stop right there  That's how it works  You don't need to go  Any further  No meaning  Don't go  What do you mean  Oh I don't have to question  No no  You just said yeah  And that's where  It should end  Oh  I would just yell stuff  Yep  No no no  No please 
[02:48:00]  Like what Chip  Damn it  Pipeful faint outbursts  Uh huh  Pretend you're making  The announcements  Yeah  Pretend you're making  The announcements  Tell me if you reckon  The momentum  Uh  Ladies and gentlemen  Uh  Big peckers  We'll be uh  Pushing back from the game  Big fucking peckers

[03:07:00]  Was collapsing  And then  Boom  The fireball  Went  The size of the house  And up  About  80 feet  And  Thank God  Tony  Wasn't home  And  She  Managed  To get out  Of the house  We should speed up

How are you?  How are you?  We're on the air  So take a seat  Yes sir  Oh you have the  You're carrying a different book 
[03:17:00]  Than I'm promoting for you  We're trading  Me and Martha  Oh you're sorry outside?  No  I will be  Just swapping books  She'll get mine tomorrow  And I just got her  She just left this for me  You know I saw them  They were here before  They were kind of walking by  And they went out to do the view  And I had to get a picture with them  Because like that was  A big part of my life  Growing up in the 80s  Was watching the VJs  If you see  Look at these  Wonderful photos  She was 
[03:17:30]  Where is that?  He's looking for  Oh yeah there she is  I had to put that in there  She doesn't look  I'll tell you  She does not look  That much different now  Like Martha's one of those people  Who has aged really well  She's a sweetheart  And Nina Blackwood  You ever see a movie  Called Vice Squad  It was  No Nina  That's what I was talking about  Oh you're talking about Nina Blackwood?  Well her I said  Dude  Because we were talking about  This book this morning  She played a prostitute  In a movie called  That was the first time 
[03:18:00]  I ever saw her  It was a movie called  Vice Squad  Where she got like  She got beaten to death  Early in the movie  It was before  She filmed it  Before she became a VJ  Nice part  Yeah yeah yeah  It was a grill  Oh before a VJ huh?  Yeah yeah  Interesting  And then she became the VJ  And I guess the movie came out  And kind of you know  Embarrassed her  But uh  So I literally got this book  I'm very disappointed  So I got it last night  I'm already on page 60  It's fucking fantastic  Well it would take like  You know like I've said  Probably you know  In these interviews  It would take probably  About 10 books 
[03:18:30]  You know  And you know  I've got like  Literally boxes and boxes  Of personal photos  I was a picture fanatic  Yeah  On the road  But I'd take pictures  Of the audience  Anything happening backstage  On stage  You know  I'm the same way  And I find it  People are like  Why do you take so many pictures  It's like because  If it's not for now  It's when you look back  15 years from now  You're like  Fuck I remember that moment  Or that guy  Sure  And it's crazy  Because I do come across  Some pictures  And I just go  Oh man  I didn't know this went down  You know  Some crazy  And some cool 
[03:19:00]  Right  Some shots  You're taking a blackout  And you're like  Oh wow  That happened  You know  And so it's all good  What inspired you to write  Because the book starts  It's really interesting  What you're talking about  I guess being really fucked up  And you're trying to cut  Your daughter's umbilical cord  Yeah  I don't want anybody  To get misconception  It's like you know  The baby was in the hands  Of the  You know  Out of the mom  And her mom  And I was just waiting there  And first to hold her actually  And then you know  You got that bit of cord left  And I was just amazed 
[03:19:30]  It wasn't me being  You know  Wasted  It was  I was just amazed  How sharp these surgical scissors were  And they couldn't cut to this little cord  You know  I was like  Wow  You know  They turned  Embellished a little bit on that  But you know  I was just amazed  Aren't these surgical  And I'm not that high  Am I  But you are a little high  I was a little high  Yeah  How did that change you  That experience  It changed my life  When I had my daughter  It full  Just immediately  Just changed my life  You know  I just cried right there 
[03:20:00]  You know  Wow  I got a new  Human to take care of  Now finally  Somebody besides myself  You know  Right  And that made you want to sober up  It changed everything  Yeah  Did you get sober after that  Mm-hmm  Yeah  And then Robin  Our guitar player  When you know  He passed  That was the  When it really went down to  You know  It was a wake up call  Had you guys known  That he was not doing well  Yeah  We did  You know  And I knew  What was going down 
[03:20:30]  What he was doing  Throughout the years  You know  I mean  Even being  You know  Partying and stuff  You know  We used to  When we'd do video shoots  You know  We'd have to  Me and Phil Schwartz  Who I talk about in the book  Real good security guy of mine  Concierge dude  And friend  We used to like  Stash his  I mean  Take it  We took a gun from him actually  You know  And  And we  You know  Find his  His shit  And we'd throw it away  And  Why did you take the gun  Were you afraid  That he was going to harm himself  Or somebody else 
[03:21:00]  Well I mean  He obviously  Had the gun  To go  When he went to score  You know  And  So during  When we were doing  The detonator video  Which lasted like two weeks  He would disappear at lunch  And  Where in the hell is he  He'd show up like two hours  Three hours later  And  We finally just went  Oh shit  We've got to  Went through his stuff  And went  We've got to get this thing  Out of his hands  You know  At that time too  You were I guess  Active as well  And partying  And doing your thing  Oh yeah sure  And it's always I guess  You know  All of us were  You always try to find somebody 
[03:21:30]  Who's like  In worse shape  Than we are  To look at  And go  Well if I ever get  Like that fucked up  You know  I'll slow down  Or I'll stop  We kind of  You know  You know  Made sure  We were all in check  To some degree  But you know  When you're all  Doing your own trip  You know  But I guess  Robin and I  Were pretty much  The ones who  Were the worst  You know  Worse for wear  If you call it that  We were functioning  Dysfunctional  You know  Addicts per se  Was there a point  Where you felt like  Or what point  Did you feel like 
[03:22:00]  It just totally  Got out of control  How long into the whole  You know  Being a rock star  Or was it before that  It wasn't even  In the band  It was  You know  I mean  I left  My own band  And after  The detonator  Tour  I mean  We were just  Fried  I was fried  You know  We had been  Touring record  Touring record  You know  250 shows a year  I mean  It was ridiculous  You know  It was cool  For a few years  But then  You know  When you don't  Start remembering  A year or two  Right  It's time to stop  And I did  I said  I've got to 
[03:22:30]  Get away from this  For a few years  You know  And I did  Did you guys  As the 80's  Were coming to a close  Did you see  Like when  When grunge  Was happening  Or the music scene  Was kind of changing  Did you see that at all  As a threat  To what you were doing  No  It was  You know  Everybody has such a  When people say that  Did grunge kill rock  Or  No  Of course not  It was just  Taste in music  And climate  It had nothing to do  With grunge  Where are they now  Right  Who's left standing 
[03:23:00]  You know  I mean  I don't care  If you label us  Hair metal  Or whatever  To me  It's just rock and roll  It's rat and roll  You know  We're still here  We're still doing big shows  We're still making records  You know  Thank God  And it's more of a privilege now  But I mean  When I hear that  Grunge killed rock  Metal  It's ridiculous  But you know  It's like  Every X amount of years  There's just  Like these people  It just happens  Changes  But then what was popular now  That kind of  You know  You know what killed it  Is the oversaturation  Of the new copycat bands 
[03:23:30]  That came after  The Motleys  And the Rats  And the Wasps  And the Quiet Riots  And the  You know  I mean  You know  We were  Our own genre  You know  81  82  83  84  And once we all  You know  All these type bands  Got started  What happened after that  Was everybody  Had to have a rat  Or a Motley  Or something  That's what killed it  It just got  It just got corny  It just got stupid  Well so you got the else  They were trying to find guys  That looked the part  As opposed to guys 
[03:24:00]  That made them the part  They built their own  Little mini rats  And you know  Whatever per se  And some of the bands  Were good  I'm not going to take that  Away from them  To each his own  You know  But it's  You know  It's all in the pudding  You know  Are you still around  Are you still working  Are you still making records  Are you still acting  You know  That's what tells the story  Do you think 80's metal  Gets a  I think it gets a bad rap  Sometimes  Because again  People say hair bands  Like it's a dismissive thing  But you know what I mean  But there's a lot of  Really good music  Of course it's good music 
[03:24:30]  I mean  That's all it is  Is music  And even  When we started  We didn't try to keep up  With the Joneses  Rat  We didn't want to be  Press Darlings  We didn't care about  You know  Telling you our exploits  And you know  What we did  Who we banged  What we  Drugs we did  We just did our own thing  You know  Stealth  Zeppelin style  That's how I wanted us  And that's how we were  So you know  That  All that did  Was just keep us  Out of the limelight  A bit  You know  We were going to sell  Records  Anyway 
[03:25:00]  Regardless  If it  Was platinum  Or gold  Or double  Triple  Whatever  You know  You know  If your music's good  It's good  There's an interesting part  Or again  Early in the book too  Usually when someone  Writes a biography  They'll set it up  With something interesting  And then a lot of times  The childhood stuff  Is slow  But yours certainly  Was not  It was really  Really interesting  To read  And can you talk  A little about  How you came up  Because  It wasn't  A very typical  You seem like  You grew up  With some violence  And some real  Unpleasantness  Yeah but 
[03:25:30]  And I'm sure  I'm not the only one  And the reason  I did it  Was just to give  A perspective  Of you know  How I got into this  I should be racing cars  I shouldn't  You know  That was your first love  Stumps  I mean  I literally  Got into music  By default  By just  You know  An accident  Literally  What happened  You know  Well I got  Run over  And busted both legs  And ended up  In the hospital  For about five  Six months  You know  On my back  And that was it 
[03:26:00]  They said  You're irreparable  If you break your legs  So don't think  You're going to race  So when you broke  Your legs  You were  You were completely  Laid up  Was there a point  Where you thought  You might not walk again  Yeah  100%  They didn't think  My legs were  Going to heal  As a matter of fact  They weren't healing  For a long time  I mean  I'd sit there  In the hospital  And push on my femurs  And I'd hear them click  You know  You know  Just  Which meant  And then they finally  Went in and did bone grafts  And wires  And rods  And pins  And  And after 
[03:26:30]  A time  You know  I started  To heal  And I had to learn  To walk again  You know  Wheelchair  To crutches  To you know  You were a teenager?  Uh huh  Teenager  It's weird too  I guess when you go  From something  Where you think  You might not walk again  So when you start  To realize you're going to  Alright I'm going to have  A little bit of mobility  And when did you realize  Like wow  Things are going to be  Completely okay  Well  I mean  I'm just a hyper person  Anyway  And they weren't okay 
[03:27:00]  For a while  Because even when I got  Out of the wheelchair  I don't think it's in the book  You know  I  Was so active  On the crutches  One of the rods  In my legs  Had metal fatigue  And  It started coming out  Through my back  It started slipping  Through the femur  And  Literally  It was bending  And if it would have  Imploded in my leg  I would have lost  My leg  So I had to go in  And you know  Get that pulled out  Another one put in  More wires  More pins 
[03:27:30]  And then  You know  And then after  You know  Okay  You could use one crutch now  And then  A cane  And then  You know  Then I was  Okay  And I think you said  That at that time  You were in the hospital  You had two busted legs  And somebody brought you a guitar  And that was kind of  Your first introduction to it  Yeah  I mean  It was  Okay  A guitar  And  You know  I just  What else are you going to do  I just kind of adapted to it  I mean  I was a fan of rock music  You know  I was  But  I wasn't a fanatic 
[03:28:00]  Rock music dude  Until  I was  Actually playing this guitar  And  You know  My sister's boyfriend  Taught me some chords  And  You know  And then asked me  To sing  And  And then  Started just going from there  I was amazed  That you  You talk about being in the hospital  And every guy's fantasy  Is to fuck a nurse  Or an orderly  Or a  Candy striper  Anybody that works  Candy stripper I call  And you  And you picked off a few  While you  You actually did the porno thing 
[03:28:30]  While you were  Truly injured  Well I mean  Look  I was in there  I was the second  Longest  Longest  Term patient  In this hospital  And  It's  Doctors hospital  In San Diego  I was  So I decided  Look  If I'm going to be  In here  I'm going to  Live in here  You know  And we'd have  Little keg  Pony keg  Parties  I'd smoke pot  In there  You know  And they'd give me  My meds  And I'd take  A couple hits  Of weed  And I was walking  I was  Astroplanning  You know 
[03:29:00]  And the girls  Come by  Of course  I was a  Teenage  Boy  And I wanted  To get  Something  Yeah but  How do you  Pull that off  That's the  I would have  Wanted something  Too  But they probably  Wouldn't have  Agreed to it  That's the  Amazing point  I don't know  I was just  Some long haired  Hippie kind of kid  You know  And I don't know  Who knows  I got it though  It was kind of cool  You know  He just moved the wires  And the ropes  Out of the way  And they  Sit on you  And go for it  And you talk  About  It's interesting  You talk about 
[03:29:30]  Being an addictive  Person  And like  You talk about  Therapy  And him asking  You if you think  That you're a  Sex addict  Yeah  And like  So you think  What do you think  About that  As far as  Just being  Alcohol and drugs  Or do you think  It kind of  Went further back  I'm  You know  As far as  The  You know  The sex  Thing  I mean  I'm just  Like any other  You know  Male who wants  To get laid  Except  You know  Later on  When you get  This gold  Platinum  Debauchery card  You can pretty much 
[03:30:00]  Do what you want  You know  And I did  What was it like  Again  When you're in that  Position  And you have  Platinum records  And you guys  Have sold 15 million albums  I mean  Was it 9 or 10  Platinum and gold records  I mean  It's just  Oh god  We're still getting them  Thank god  You know  But it's all good  I don't count  It's  Never cared then  Don't care now  But when you're  In that position  And you're on top  Of the world  And you're doing shows  What exactly  Is the  What is the process  Of okay  I want to  Sleep with a groupie  Because you can't  Go out in the audience 
[03:30:30]  And meet them  Oh sometimes you can  No I'd send people  Out there  My guys out there  Look I watched  Van Halen  Very closely  In the early days  Before  And I told myself  You know  In my band  That's how we're  Going to do it  We're going to be  Big rock  You know  Well how did they do it  Well they did it right  That's all  What did they send  Now do you send  The guy out to  Yeah sure  You know  And it's kind of  Became the norm  You know  You know  It's a signal  Or whatever  And then you know  You see 
[03:31:00]  Meet girls before  And during  And after  And it's just  One of those things  And then we'd load up  A couple rooms  With about 50 girls  And kind of go in there  And look  And take your pick  And that's it  You have a party  Now would you get  Any  Believe me  That's a much  Different life  Than a comedian leads  Would you  Would you  Ever like  Get a girl  Into the dressing room  And then she was like  Oh no  I just wanted to talk  Would you get that shit too  Yeah that's cool  You can talk  You know  But the ones  Who knew what was going on  You know  And I mean  Look  I just wasn't  Some sexual deviant dude 
[03:31:30]  I mean I had relationships  That were all copacetic  But you know  Until I got locked  Into marriage  Or something  I was going to  Do as I please  You know  Respectfully  You know  You tell a good story too  This one kind of  I mean I know  It creeps you out  Was the  You said you guys  Were on like a big  Midwestern or Texas tour  And a woman brought  Her daughter by  Yeah  Named Cinnamon  And uh  Well I call her Cinnamon  Oh that was just  The name  Okay  But what exactly  Was the story with that  Because it was a very odd one  Well yeah  I mean  You know  This woman came backstage 
[03:32:00]  With you know  Her daughter  And it happened  A couple times  The same person  And just tried to  Pawn her kid off on me  You know  And I was just like  Shit  You know  This is  This is tripping  You know  How old is she  First of all  And second of all  Did you do this  When Motley came through  Or any other band  You know  And uh  Was the kid of age  Yeah  But just the whole  Trip was just  Weird  You know  I mean look  You know  We've had  Husbands offer their wives 
[03:32:30]  And girlfriends  And you know  I mean it's just trippy  You know  It's the weirdest  Occupation possible  Did you ever take  Because I've gotten  The weird emails  About the husbands  Hey my wife wants you  To fuck her  Did you  Did you  Ever take a husband  Up on it  No  Me personally  Never  Never  No  And it was always  Very upsetting  When you know  You'd find out  Hey you know  You know  My girlfriend  It's like  Shit well  Keep a tighter leash  On that person  Oh you've got guys  Who were mad at you  Yeah  Well I mean look  You know  It's like  You don't know 
[03:33:00]  I mean  You know  People come on the bus  And then it got to  Where we actually  Just got smart about it  Like hey look  You married  You this  You that  We don't  There's so many  There's enough out there  We don't need to  Right  You know  Take advantage  Of somebody's  You know  You know  Woman  Yeah  Cause then you get  Somebody fucking  Hunting you with a pistol  It's just ridiculous  You know  And if it happened  Well  Don't blame us  You know  It's like  Shit happens  But  You know  I've  I've personally  Stayed very clear 
[03:33:30]  Of  You know  That kind of a scene  If you could help  Yeah  Yeah  Totally  And you also  You became friends  I'm kind of jealous of this  I met Kinison once  In my life  I just got to talk to him  For five minutes  I was very new  And doing an open mic  And he came in from the big room  And he talked to some of the young comics  And he was really really nice  And you were kind of a part of the  You were in the  What the  The wild thing video  And you became  You got to know him pretty well  Yeah  He was cool  You know  He'd have these parties  And you know 
[03:34:00]  For years  We'd hang out with him  You know  And I mean  Talk about partying  Jesus Christ  The guy had more drugs  And pussy around  Than most rock did  He did right  Oh yeah  I mean it was nuts  I mean I've  Go to a studio  And you  You get all these people there  And you know  A bowl of  Coke  I was never  Really into blow  So  You know  That was  You know  But it was  It was pretty  Pretty crazy  What was your thing  If you weren't into coke  What did you find yourself  Really taking to  Sex and drugs 
[03:34:30]  But I mean  Yeah  But what kind of drugs  Whatever  Yeah  Yeah  I wasn't into the smack  And stuff until later  But I never got into the  Spiking  You know  That was later on  Stuff I did  I was pretty much into the  You know  The drinking  And the  You know  The girls  And things like that  Did it  Do you think it hurt  The progress  Of the  Because you guys did so well  It's kind of hard to say  Hey I gotta quit doing this  When the band is doing so well 
[03:35:00]  It took its toll  Sometimes  Sure  You know  When you got  Like you know  Robin said  In one of his last interviews  You know  You gotta do something  To get up  You gotta do something  To stay up  You know  Do something during the show  You gotta do something  To go to sleep  After the show  You know  But then again  You know  I  We never really had a break  You know  This rat was  Constantly on the road  In the studio  I mean  It was  Like  Who never had a moment  I mean  If we had some time off 
[03:35:30]  Maybe we would have had  A little bit  Perspective on  You know  Actually what we were doing  To ourselves  And you know  But you know  Didn't happen  So now you hear  You are in this position  Where you're kind of  You know  You've gone through everything  And you're sober  And you're still out on the road  And how do the  How do the younger bands  Treat you  I mean  Is it kind of nice to be  Like  Because you talk about  When you first saw Van Halen  Or when you  When you first heard about them  When you were in LA  And now people  Will talk  Younger musicians  Talk that way about you  Yeah  Well  God 
[03:36:00]  It's cool  If they  You know  It's cool  When new bands  Dig you  Respect you  And  It's a compliment  You know  I don't  I wouldn't give them  Any advice  But to just  Try to keep it together  And make good music  How psyched you  About the new Sabbath song  It's all I'm thinking of  Oh I think it's great  It's fucking fantastic  Yeah  It's way cool  It's always weird  When your favorite band  Puts out something  And you're not  Like you know  It's been 35 years  Other than you know  Selling my soul  And Psycho Man  And you're like 
[03:36:30]  How is this going to be  It's scary  Almost  When a band you love  That much  Is putting out something  After a long time  It becomes scary  You don't even look forward to it  And then when it finally  Comes out and you like  You're like  Oh fucking thank god  Yeah I mean look  The last Rat record we did  It was 10 years  And we're getting ready  To do another record  And we'll have our shit together  This time a lot more  Yeah were the critics  Kind to you  Or were they  I mean how did they  Treat you throughout your career  And does it matter to you  It's alright  And it  No you know  We tried to keep  Gene  We tried to 
[03:37:00]  You know  Stay out there  Keeping the mix  Do what you had to do  The MTV  The this and that  And  But we really  Didn't try to make ourselves  Into some media darlings  Or like we were always  Needing to be in the press  And so  You know  That kind of maybe  Hindered some popularity  Per se  From what people  Back then expected  Like oh they're not  Crazy enough  Well that's cool  We were  We just didn't need  To tell you  You know  Everything  You know  We were pretty much  A champagne 
[03:37:30]  Against a Jack Daniels  Kind of a thing  You know  Stealth  I mean look  I was a big fan  Of Zeppelin  And liked that  Whole aura  Of just  Doing our thing  Undercover  Dancing undercover  You know  Did any of those  Guys back then  And this is something  I've had to know  Because there was  All these spandex  And leather pants  Did any lead singers  Stuff their pants  No  Everybody claimed  I had socks  In mine  Or something  And I'd say  You know  Hey  You want to check it out  You know  I'm thinking  More of a Bruce Dickinson  Photo  The famous Bruce Dickinson  Photo  Where he's got  His fucking foot up 
[03:38:00]  On the thing  And it looks like  He's got like a fucking  Like an arm in his pants  I'm like  That's stuffed  Because that's what  I would have done  I don't know  I don't know  I've heard that about  You know  People saying stuff  And it just cracks me up  You know  Is that a wrong question  To ask  No  Not at all  The singer's penises  Fucking grown man  And that's what  I'm asking you  Sorry  Well the book is called  Sex, Drugs, Rat and Roll  My Life in Rock  And you are doing  Signings too  Yeah  Tonight  At  Bookends
