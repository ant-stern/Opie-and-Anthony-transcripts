<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion centered around E-Rock's deceptive request for time off to attend WrestleMania Radio Row at MetLife Stadium.  His text messages, read on air, revealed his plan to assist Sam Roberts with interviews as a cover for meeting wrestlers.  E-Rock was described as "shady" but ultimately lovable.  A call from Sam Roberts at WrestleMania confirmed E-Rock's presence, though his "assistance" mostly involved sorting wrestling action figures.  Sam mentioned CM Punk and Paul Heyman's appearances at Radio Row.  The segment included a humorous video of Jim Norton fixated on Fandango's crotch, which had gone viral.  Logistical problems with the Opie and Anthony team's WrestleMania seating and parking passes, along with Sal's tardiness, were also highlighted.  A call from CM Punk followed, discussing his WWE storyline and the Paul Bearer angle.  The ongoing frustration with WrestleMania logistics and jokes about E-Rock's manipulative communication continued throughout.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the logistical nightmare of leaving Giant Stadium events, particularly the lengthy commutes involving Secaucus Junction.  Concerns about obtaining parking passes for WrestleMania, despite their past fame, led to humorous suggestions of using a helicopter or contacting Donald Trump Jr.  The show announced guests: Jamie Levy (*Evil Dead*), Chris Hardwick (*Talking Dead*), and Pat LaFrieda ("King of Meats"), who would be providing burgers for Hamburger Day.  A discussion about beverage pairings ensued, including anecdotes about Kenny's unusual beverage preferences.  A comedic bit, "Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide," featuring Jim Norton's graphic anal hygiene advice, was followed by a sarcastic review of Anthony Cumia's private movie theater.  A confused segment followed where the hosts repeatedly questioned if they were on air.  

A call with Sam Roberts at WrestleMania followed, discussing the event's lineup including The Rock vs. John Cena, Brock Lesnar vs. Triple H, and CM Punk's potential upset of The Undertaker.  Paul Heyman joined the call, confirming CM Punk's victory over The Undertaker and Brock Lesnar's victory over Triple H.  Heyman shared anecdotes about Brock Lesnarâ€™s health and past appearances on the show, and the conversation touched on Jesse Ventura.  The conversation shifted back to Jim Norton's WrestleMania concerns, with Paul Heyman offering assurances.  A caller recounted childhood abuse, prompting discussion about difficult family dynamics and further calls with similar experiences.  This was followed by an interview with Jane Levy, who detailed her frightening experiences filming *Evil Dead*, including being buried alive and having dirt thrown in her face.

The Jane Levy interview continued, discussing her roles in *Shameless* and *Suburgatory*.  The conversation moved to upcoming television shows, including a Mike Tyson-hosted daytime talk show and *Should I Suck a Dick or Not* with Joe DeRosa.  Fictional show promotions were interspersed.  The "Burger Day" segment began with the arrival of Pat LaFrieda, who discussed his business, dealing with city bureaucracy, and the humane slaughtering of cows.  Chris Hardwick briefly appeared, promoting his appearance at Caroline's and *Talking Dead*.  The hosts bantered with the "Morning Mashup" crew before concluding the Burger Day segment and the conversation surrounding the eating of burgers on air. Sexually suggestive humor and vulgar language occurred frequently throughout.


The show resumed with a rant about inefficient city regulations concerning trucking and delivery in New York City.  This led to a discussion about the poor quality and expensive food on Amtrak's Acela train.  Guests Dennis Falcone and Chris Hardwick joined in studio.  Hardwick was questioned about his reluctance to offer strong opinions on television.  The conversation then shifted to the high cost of attending baseball games.  Pat LaFrieda also joined, discussing his family's meat business, his past as a stockbroker, and the challenges of the meat market. He provided plugs for burger establishments after a segment detailing the burgers received.  The hosts discussed their reactions to delivery trucks' parking tickets, including an anecdote about a Coca-Cola driver.  The conversation touched upon government spending and inefficiency, referencing Ground Zero reconstruction.  A fictional radio segment, "Yentas Explorers," followed, along with a short interview with Chip Chipperson discussing UFC fighters Clay Guida and Chael Sonnen.  A longer conversation with Chris Hardwick ensued, covering his television work, past radio experiences, chess, and stand-up comedy.  Two of Pat LaFrieda's employees were briefly interviewed.  The show ended with Jim Norton preparing for his advice show, with a significant portion of the conversation containing sexually explicit content and crude humor.

The final segment featured numerous callers with relationship issues: a husband concerned about his wife's weight gain (described using highly offensive terms), and another caller whose wife has a tilted cervix.  A caller discussed his compulsive lying friend, while another detailed his hypochondria and anxiety. Several callers discussed addiction, including a functional alcoholic who transitioned to opiate addiction.  A caller questioned the legality of teen pornography on xHamster and RedTube.  Another caller sought book recommendations, receiving suggestions like Ozzy Osbourne's and Peter Criss' autobiographies. A caller whose girlfriend was an escort discussed his conflicting feelings, and another caller discussed jealousy issues stemming from childhood trauma.  The hosts offered relationship advice and discussed the challenges of writing and overcoming writer's block throughout.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  One radio show that's been so extreme. 
[00:03:30]  Oh my God.  God.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, I mean, this is insane.  So flatulent.  Why don't we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  It's a weird show.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real. 
[00:04:00]  That's sex.  Oh!  Turn in with no expectations.  Once in the day.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we go.  The Anthony show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time.  You guys having a good time or what?  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check it.  Yeah.  Check it.  Yeah.  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning with Opie Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people.  What to say in this old?  Objectible human beings.  And I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King.  Opie and Opie.  Anthony show.  Go.  Go.  I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking.  Jimmy's trying to get blown.  And we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before. 
[00:05:00]  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting a shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of your chair.  Cause we really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Check it.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this bitch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga booga. 
[00:05:30]  Booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  How great is that, man?  We only play it on Fridays.  But you got Larry King, Mike Tyson, and 50 Cent singing about our damn radio show.  I haven't heard that in a while.  And 50 Cent actually sings in there, Anthony wants to join the clan.  Holy fuck is that great.  Yeah.  The music is really low, Sal.  We want people to think that something's going on here. 
[00:06:00]  Thanks.  Yeah.  We said concert level, Sal.  Good old Sal who decided today was the perfect day to come in kind of late.  The day where Anthony's out, Sam's out, E-Rock's out.  So Sal goes, you know what?  I think today is the day I'll take my time getting into work.  45 minutes.  Why is E-Rock out?  They're doing a little wrestling thing today.  Eric's pretending to help Sam at the WrestleMania radio.  What?  Sam doesn't need Eric.  No, he doesn't. 
[00:06:30]  He's got to plug things in and point a mic at somebody.  And Eric started working me on this about a week ago.  And I just finally gave in.  I'm just like, yeah, do what you got to do.  He wanted to meet the wrestlers or anything?  Well, you know.  Yeah.  If he would have just said that, that's fine.  It's just how he does things.  It bothers me.  Did he go to you?  Yeah.  He's like, I don't know.  I want to go out there, help Sam just in case he needs my help, this and that.  And I'm sitting there like, you're a huge wrestling fan.  You want to go there and get some pictures.  That's fine.  He went to you because Gary said no. 
[00:07:00]  I know.  Did Gary say no?  Yes, he did.  Gary said Sam doesn't need help.  Yeah.  Gary said no.  So E-Rock started working me.  But it's just how he works me.  Like, we've known each other for a long time.  Pull me aside and go, look, I really want to do this thing.  Just be honest.  You mind?  Yeah.  You wouldn't believe me if I came to you and said, dude, look, I mean, Sam's interviewing  Sabbath.  A lot of the cords might get tangled.  I want to untangle the cords for Sam.  You wouldn't think that was a believable excuse?  You'd think I just wanted to see them?  That's why it's just tough to have a relationship with E-Rock because he's just so, like... 
[00:07:30]  He's never forthcoming.  No, he's just so vague.  He's shady.  I think Sam really needs my help, but he won't tell me.  Right.  But he doesn't even mean to be shady.  I don't even think he's covering up anything.  He just lives his life in this weird, like, gray area of shadiness.  So where is this wrestling row?  I think it's at MetLife.  Oh, it's out there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they're all going out there just to do a radio row?  Wow.  Yeah, they're doing it kind of...  It's kind of like the Super Bowl, I guess, where, you know, there's a bunch of radio stations 
[00:08:00]  set up and all these wrestlers are going to parade through at six in the morning.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they want to get morning radio.  You know, and then next time E-Rock has a tequila and donut day, he's going to fucking,  you know, go after me again.  But I can't help it.  I got his text messages.  You want me to read it?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Badly.  He goes, oh, something else.  Two weeks from now, so we go back a while, obviously.  Friday before WrestleMania, which obviously is today, they're doing radio row, which Sam 
[00:08:30]  will be attending that morning.  Sam will be attending that morning.  Gary doesn't want me going.  So the...  I don't know where this goes after that.  So the...  Oh, so the show is down both of us.  You see how he did that?  Sam will be attending that morning.  Gary doesn't want me going.  Oh, so the show is down both of us.  I understand.  But I would like to go if possible.  If you'd rather me stay, I won't complain.  I'll just sulk a fatso. 
[00:09:00]  So then I'm like, tell Gary we'll make two.  You guys will get great material for the show.  Sam will.  Yeah, go ahead.  Here's the worst part of that, so far.  Can you read the opening line again?  Yeah.  Oh, something else.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the whole reason this phony wrote you about whatever bullshit he talked to you about before.  But just, oh, as an aside, my heroes will be talking to Sam. 
[00:09:30]  Almost forgot.  You know, of course he...  While we're talking about this, the roles thing, can I go meet my heroes while we're talking about the thing in the studio?  It's all that corporate shit where they hit you with something else, but then they can hit you with the real shit.  Like, he thinks I don't know this stuff?  Are you kidding me?  I'm a lot older than you.  I've been around.  I know this.  Here's what his opening text should have been.  Opie, please let me go meet the wrestlers.  Yes.  Just say that.  And then, of course, I don't know, at least a week or so goes by, and then he writes, 
[00:10:00]  Hey, tomorrow morning, can we talk WrestleMania radio, Ro?  I thought we already talked about it.  He goes, I know I mentioned it last week to you, but need to discuss, because Gary hasn't fully said no, but doesn't seem to want me to go help Sam with it.  Because you don't care about helping Sam with it.  Yeah, because Sam already said I don't need help.  Sam doesn't need help. 
[00:10:30]  Sam's his own guy.  Sam's going to get interviews, and they're going to be great.  Sam will just drive in his car with all the equipment, set it up himself, and get some interviews.  He doesn't need help.  He probably doesn't want E-Rock there just taking up his space and wrestling questions.  I like how Eric phrases it as, Gary doesn't want me to help.  Yeah.  Gary's hurting the show.  Yeah.  Travis is in studio, by the way, because I guess we've got to mention your names more, because people get confused out there.  I do sound a lot like Sam.  And then he finishes with, then I'll leave you alone about it. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  Wants me to talk to Gary again about it.  And then he writes, then I'll leave you alone about it.  Well, it would be great if you came on the air today screaming about why isn't E-Rock here.  We need the hell out.  In the end.  Fucking got him in trouble with Gary.  Like, why did you let him go?  Gary was like, I didn't let him go.  Right.  In the end, whatever.  In the end, we'll have a good show.  You know, people are out today.  But in the end, we'll have another fine radio show.  It's just how we set this shit up a long time ago.  And then yesterday, I forgot to talk to you today. 
[00:11:30]  Can you tell Gary Monday or Tuesday?  He's just always working some angle.  But he's not slick at all.  He's horribly not slick.  That's the beauty of E-Rock, is he's lumbering.  Yes.  But he acts like he's fucking sneaking around.  Yes.  He's really not slick at all.  So now I need to know from Sam.  He would be a terrible cat burglar.  Yeah, he really would be.  He would just trudge through things and leave fingerprints everywhere and knock hobbles over. 
[00:12:00]  He's just a lump.  He's a lump, E-Rock.  And mentally, he's a lump.  He's lovable, but he's just, hold on.  I think Eric is irreplaceable on the radio.  Oh, of course.  I would say that in a second.  Call on Eric.  Call on Sam.  Hello?  Sam, you're on the air.  Yeah, dude, I'm listening to you on my headphones.  Oh, you're listening?  This is the best show of the week so far. 
[00:12:30]  I love this.  Oh, you love it?  Yeah, it's fantastic.  The telling of the story couldn't be more accurate.  Oh, okay.  You can pot up our ISBN thing on your board, and you can talk to me and Eric.  Can you hear me right now?  Eric, how are you?  I got my speaker, but if you literally, we would do it there.  Nah, Mars decided not to set this up properly today, so.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, well.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:13:00]  We're good.  Hello?  You can hang the phone up.  Hello?  It's kind of echoey.  It's only in my left.  And it's only in our left ear, Mars.  Eric, talk.  I'm talking.  You sound fine on this end.  I can hear Eric in both ears.  You can?  Yeah, unfortunately, yes.  Eric.  I can only hear him in my left ear.  I can only hear him in one ear.  You were hearing Eric through the phone.  Yeah, see, I was doing this.  I just hung up the phone.  Can you hear me?  I can hear Sam in my left ear.  Yeah, we can only hear him in our left ear.  Would it be funny if it's all better? 
[00:13:30]  We all had tumors on the right side.  That's all it was.  What are you going to do, Mars?  What about the people that only have speakers on the fucking right side that are working?  Exactly.  We're going to be all fucked up.  It's going to be a one-sided conversation.  Let's get this done.  This is why we needed Eric here.  Yeah.  Yeah, Eric would have fixed this problem.  You got it fixed?  Mars.  Yes.  Okay.  Mars, you're sure?  Sam, talk.  Hey, what's up?  Okay.  Yeah, you do have it fixed.  Okay.  Now it's only in my right ear.  So, Sam, do you need E-Rock's help today? 
[00:14:00]  I'll tell you exactly what I told Gary.  Okay.  It wouldn't hurt for me to have an assistant on hand.  Right.  To just take care of everything that's not, you know, me being purely talent.  Right.  But I told him there's no way I can justify taking Eric away from the show.  I mean, it's just that there's no way what he's going to be doing here is more important  than what he would do on the show, especially with me gone.  Right.  That's what I said. 
[00:14:30]  And I stand by it.  I like hanging out with E-Rock.  It's going to be convenient for him to video this for me and then build everything for  me so I don't have to do anything.  Yes.  But, yeah, I mean, you very well know that I could have handled this on my own as I usually  do.  And E-Rock.  Yes.  Do you feel like you really need to help Sam today?  Yes, I do.  Can I tell you what a help E-Rock has been so far?  Sure.  Well, that was going to be my next question, Sam.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He's been a huge, huge help. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  I mean, the engineer is here with us, so the engineer was able to set everything up.  But what E-Rock did to help was, the WWE, apparently, before I got here, they had laid out wrestling  action figures on the table.  Okay.  And when I arrived, E-Rock had already sorted out who gets which action figure.  So that was huge.  Just one less thing that I have to think about is, which would do me or E-Rock get the John  Cena toy?  So let me ask you, as opposed to keeping all of them like you would have, you now have 
[00:15:30]  to split them with Eric.  Well, Eric explained that his nephew would really appreciate some action figures.  Oh, this is not for the charity for Katrina?  This is for the nephew?  Oh, at least he's finally admitting it's for family members?  Yeah, for him.  He said I could have the big show, but beyond that, he needs some.  Eric, let's work this out before it comes out in the next tequila and donut show.  Okay.  Why wouldn't you just fucking say to me, obviously, I'm a wrestling fan and I want to go?  Why does it always have to be under the guise that it's something else? 
[00:16:00]  That's all I need to know today.  If I directly ask you a question, I never get an answer.  So if I annoy you enough by dancing around the subject, it piques your interest so you  get so aggravated that you answer.  He's doing a radio bit.  See, everyone's shaking their heads.  You're doing a radio bit.  Was your interest piqued when he texted you?  Yeah, stop.  We actually have a relationship.  So if you pulled me aside and go, look, is it cool?  I really want to go.  Because it's WrestleMania in New York.  I get it. 
[00:16:30]  But you're like, hey, man, I think I need to help Sam.  Yeah, his answer to your question didn't even address the fact that he had to make something  up.  That he didn't say, hey, I'd like to do this.  You know, I go to your house and hang out with your kids.  Can I do this?  Right.  Yeah, it was poorly thought out.  Again.  We all got our things.  It's funny how the things that make me hate Eric make me love him more.  Right.  You know, like.  But we all have our things.  And, you know, like, obviously, for Jimmy, it's Black Sabbath. 
[00:17:00]  So if there's something with Black Sabbath going on, Jimmy's not going to be here.  And everyone understands that.  And everyone will cover and whatever.  But Iraq has to make believe it's not.  He's not going there for himself.  He has to help.  I kind of have to justify it.  No, not really.  You don't have to justify it to Opie.  Not really, because everyone works, you know, really hard around here.  So we all get it when one of these things pops up where you go, yeah, go enjoy yourself. 
[00:17:30]  It's like the perk of what we do.  Yeah, where you want to just run off and watch wrestlers as opposed to working.  We all enjoy.  I understand that.  You want to watch them.  You're going to see them Sunday, but you want to watch them Friday.  Right.  I understand.  Who's coming by the table today?  Well, I mean, on the list, it's, of course, card subject to change.  But CM Punk is supposed to be doing this.  So is Paul Heyman.  And then Sergeant Slaughter.  Right.  Ryback.  Dolph Ziggler.  Right.  Who dated Amy Schumer. 
[00:18:00]  Yes.  Cody Rhodes.  Right.  Horn Swaggle.  Right.  A guy named Brodus Clay, who used to be Snoop Dogg's bodyguard.  Right.  Now he's with kids, you know.  Right.  A whole bunch of people.  How about Bob Backlund?  Bob Backlund is not on the list.  I mean.  Or my go-to, Ivan Putzky.  Is the Polish Hammer going to be there?  I don't think the Polish Hammer's in the state.  Damn it!  Sorry.  I heard two names we want to, like, listen in on.  Okay.  Only two.  And they would be CM Punk and Paul Heyman. 
[00:18:30]  The rest is for you wrestling nerds.  I think Sergeant Slaughter could be fun to listen to.  Sergeant Slaughter maybe, too?  All right.  Do you want to listen in?  Do you want to participate?  What do you want to do?  I met Sergeant Slaughter once.  Did you really?  Yes, I did.  Well, I know Paul Heyman is kind of a fan of the show.  He's a fan of Sam.  I know that.  Oh, he's a fan of Sam and not a fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm just saying I know for a fact that he's a fan of Sam.  Okay.  Maybe he's a fan of the Opie and Anthony show through me.  I think I'm bringing a lot of people on board that way.  That could be it.  Yeah, a little too much wrestling.  You said it, not me. 
[00:19:00]  Way too much wrestling.  Paul Heyman and CM Punk will talk to today.  I texted CM to see if he can come on, but he said he had a crazy morning.  We could have him on right now.  I mean, through this, we could have him on, thanks to E-Rock.  No, I just wanted to brag that I texted CM.  I needed a reason to do so.  That wasn't really legitimate.  Now, the Fandango is a big star.  He doesn't tweet me anymore.  Oh, dude.  You know what?  We went to the press conference yesterday.  Yeah.  And Fandango, he came out.  It's a press conference.  And they go back and forth because they were trying to do a legit press conference. 
[00:19:30]  Like, guys with suits who aren't on TV.  Like, you know, the chairman of the New York Giants organization comes out to talk.  And then all of a sudden, Fandango's music starts playing.  And Fandango comes out.  And he interrupts the press conference.  And he walks out and he's dancing with the girl that's with him.  Right.  And he gets up on stage and he tells the press how to pronounce his name.  Right.  And the whole press is just looking at him like, what the fuck is going on? 
[00:20:00]  What is this?  And there was just one, woo, in the back.  And that was me.  And he pointed to me and did the call me gesture with his finger to his ear.  You don't think the press really cared for that?  They didn't know what was going on.  They don't know him yet.  I mean, in the wrestling world, he's huge.  But outside that, not so much.  And he didn't stop for questions.  There was no explanation as to where he just came out.  He danced.  He told everybody how to pronounce his name.  And then he bounced.  Right. 
[00:20:30]  What about The Rock?  You guys getting him?  Oh, my God.  With this rock.  The Rock was, he did the press conference.  But not only is he not doing Radio Row, he didn't do one-on-ones at all at the press conference.  I heard he was supposed to be on the Today Show yesterday.  He didn't do that.  He's Hollywood Dwayne Johnson.  He is so fucking famous.  Holy shit.  He is so famous.  He wants to do my show this afternoon.  And I said, no.  I don't want him.  I don't need him.  Bad advice. 
[00:21:00]  I don't believe in it.  Yeah.  And Kenny was bothered by the Fandango surprise appearance.  I heard about that.  I think a lot of us got text messages about it.  Why?  He thought Fandango might have been hitting on him.  I swear to God.  I know that.  You heard in the car.  Yeah, but if Fandango, A, he didn't give me gay vibes at all.  I picked those up.  But I don't think he's gay at all.  He kind of.  I thought he was just like a fun guy.  Yeah, just being silly.  And he actually went the other way with that whole thing because, you know, off mic when  we got to meet the man that plays Fandango, he wanted to make it perfectly clear that, 
[00:21:30]  you know, this is just an act.  Yeah, he's cool.  This is my way into the big wrestling world.  And he even said that his truck driver dad was a little bothered by the character he chose.  But I think he would basically yell and scream if he could that he's all man.  And Kenny thought he was hitting on him just because he kept saying, hey, what's up to him?  Right.  But do you think if Fandango is gay, he's around guys like Jericho and these guys in shape that  he's going to like.  Kenny thinks that you're the guy he's going to fuck. 
[00:22:00]  But he's in character.  I know.  Exactly.  But Kenny thinks that he's the one that Fandango would fuck.  The fucking ghoul and the cadaver in the suit with the tiny head.  Maybe he's got a fetish.  Yeah, he could have chosen any one of us.  He's going to choose Kenny.  The guy with the small head.  And I lotioned him up.  I mean, he probably saw it.  Except when I missed his arm.  Which is funny in that dumb video.  That's the first thing I noticed.  I remember doing it like, oh, how humiliating.  Really funny.  You knew at that second that it was going to come back to haunt you in the video. 
[00:22:30]  I knew I would mention it.  And then Kenny, you know, we just went, yeah, yeah, Kenny.  But, you know, he wasn't trying to hit on you or anything.  And then he writes me.  He goes, in the beginning of the Glitter Pants video, it's the one WWE posted,  WWE.com.  In the beginning of the Glitter Pants video, you could see me in the background  when he says, what's up?  That was one of the times he said it to me.  He was obsessed with how many times Fandango said hi to him. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, but he was just being friendly.  He probably thought Kenny was retarded or that he was like a retarded fan.  Fandango was really nervous.  And he was nice.  He was extremely nervous because he's still in that stage of his career.  Yeah.  He's getting so much heat, but he's not used to this yet, the spotlight.  I mean, you see a guy like Jericho who's just, fuck, we had him on, you know, he's just,  yeah, but he's just, the guy can talk at length about anything.  He's just a comfortable guy.  I mean, you got to go up against a guy like that in front of 80,000 people, man. 
[00:23:30]  That's a lot of pressure.  You're performing with a real fucking, that's like if they told me, all right, look, you got  to go on and you got to just improv with Chris for a little while in front of, Chris Rock  in front of 80,000 people.  It's like, holy fuck.  Yeah.  I would panic.  Like, you know, he's so much, you know, bigger and fun.  Yes.  I would be very nervous doing that.  But Fandango doesn't have to really improv.  They're going to stick to what has been working.  Well, but I mean, that's going to lack of performance somebody.  Yeah, they're going to have some kind of twist at WrestleMania, obviously, but I mean, 
[00:24:00]  he just, he's not going to have to do too much.  All right, Sam and E-Rock.  E-Rock's also been helping me.  He was pointing out, like, when we got here, he was pointing out the different places where  I might want to get photo ops.  Hey, do you want to take a picture on the stage?  Do you want to take a picture in the ring?  Because that's where he wants pictures.  Of course.  Every picture that Eric asks if Sam wants to take, it's because afterwards he'll say,  okay, let me get one real quick.  Yeah, of course.  I was thinking in my head, I didn't want to, you know, shoot down his dreams, but in my head 
[00:24:30]  I was thinking, I'm not really thinking about photos right now.  I'm kind of concentrating on the task at hand.  Well, I have to side with E-Rock there.  I certainly understand.  I learned it from you, Jimmy.  Of course you did.  I'm sure E-Rock was on time for the whole wrestling broadcast, huh?  Yeah.  He was actually on time.  He got here.  I was there at five.  He was here way more on time than he's ever been for the show.  You've never been here by five.  You were there at five?  What the fuck?  That's all we've asked from this kid.  I arrived to work at five o'clock. 
[00:25:00]  Here's why.  Over the years, I said, Eric, whatever.  Just get here at five.  You've never done it.  Dude, he wanted the toys.  I bet you E-Rock stole toys off other tables.  No, those toys were a surprise.  I had no idea they were giving them to us.  Why couldn't they get copies for each one of you guys?  They can.  They put out a certain amount on every table, but they've got extra boxes of stuff over on  the side there.  So did you get copies for you and Sam?  We're going to, yes.  We're looking at the Fandango video from WWE.  By the way, at the press conference, a lot of the WWE people were all talking about 
[00:25:30]  that video and the photo of Jimmy staring right at his bulge.  Why did I stare at his bulge?  Did I?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure I did.  He was at the door, and you're absolutely staring at his bulge.  Yeah, he's flexing, and your line of sight is right on his dick.  I don't know what the fuck's going on in his pants.  Dude, he doesn't wear underwear.  Eric, where's that photo?  Oh, it should be on my Twitter.  I think it's on my Twitter.  No, I think it was on WWE as well.  They had pictures.  No?  I put everything on the Facebook as well.  Yeah, but there is a picture where Jimmy is looking kind of down. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, your eyes are just darted right on his bulge.  Yeah, it's possible, because I think I even said it.  I don't think he's wearing underpants.  But the side view in Jimmy, everyone at WWE loved it.  Jimmy, you have like a half smile, like, yeah.  Jimmy, that doesn't look good.  No.  That's really one of those photos that needs a little explaining.  Well, the best is your eyes are definitely down looking at his crotch, 
[00:26:30]  and there's just a nice little smile on Jimmy's face, a little boyish smile.  I was probably just amused, but it doesn't look that like I was just amused.  It looks like I'm really enjoying the festivities.  He's flexing at the door before he leaves or when he first got in.  I think you're right.  He doesn't wear underpants.  No, that's...  Because the side view, when he was stretching as you're oiling up his back  or lotioning up his back, you could see his fucking, I don't know,  something was going on down there.  It's very funny to me.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  Look at Roland backing up. 
[00:27:00]  All right, so when do you guys start interviewing?  They should be starting to bring people around in 10, 15 minutes or so.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, so we can just let you know when Punk or Paul Heyman is here.  Yeah, give us a heads up.  We'll do a little something-something.  That Fandango thing is not the buzz of WWE.  It's the buzz of the industry.  I went to an indie show last night to do color commentary, and somebody,  one of the wrestlers in the ring pointed me out and from the ring mentioned 
[00:27:30]  the Fandango video that he had seen.  Everybody's talking about it.  Oh, really?  Oh, good.  Yeah.  That's good.  That series actually did put it on their site by 6 p.m. or so, which was good.  That was good, you know, because you never want to get stuff out early.  You always want to wait a few hours until it's on all the wrestling sites  and then throw it up.  I was telling Jimmy, when you've got a video that you know is going to work,  you've got to get it out there immediately.  This shit is immediate, and the shelf life on these videos are barely a day  at this point, and it turned out SiriusXM put up their version at, what, 
[00:28:00]  5 or 6 o'clock that night?  Yeah, it was just after you and WWE.com and my what's the haps,  and all those videos went up.  Look, as soon as he walked in, I'm like, fuck,  I didn't have my regular camera set up, so I'm like, I got to film.  This is so obvious.  And then I made sure I uploaded it immediately.  That shit you have to upload immediately.  Yeah, the video O put up got picked up by every wrestling fan site everywhere. 
[00:28:30]  They were not even linking to them.  They were stealing your video and just embedding it in their own site.  That's what the Internet does.  They're just lovely fucking people.  Can you send me that picture?  I really fucking want to retake it.  How many views for the SiriusXM version?  Sirius 1.  5,100.  Well, geez, Eric.  That's a lot for SiriusXM.  I think it's because we put it on the Facebook.  Yeah, that's it.  My shaky, horrible cell phone video is up to, I don't know, 40-something already. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, 44,000.  44,000.  Just a little bit ahead.  Yeah.  So why is it that I could figure out how to promote stuff way better than a whole company?  That's so stupid.  I had a question.  Sure.  You want to know how I do it?  Did I hear right?  Sal was not on time today?  Of course not.  The one day we needed him.  The one day.  I think Sal figured because he was filling in for Eric, he should show up when Eric normally shows up.  Oh, 6.05? 
[00:29:30]  I was still early if you want to compare it to Eric.  When everyone else is here, we do him a favor.  But when everyone is missing, then he has to do us a favor and get here on time.  Why weren't you on time, Sal?  I missed my train today.  Sorry, I took a train.  I took the later train and I took a cab here to get here to ASAP.  Oh, see.  Hey, I took a cab.  What do you want?  Spent extra money.  Yeah, exactly.  It's your job, Sal.  Did it ever occur to you that maybe you should make damn sure that nothing goes wrong today? 
[00:30:00]  I'm going to try my best today.  Oh, God.  You hear that, Sam?  Yeah.  I mean, this is the moment.  This was the idea.  I can't believe all the opportunities to get blown.  Sam knows.  Sam knows.  This was the moment.  There's nobody there.  When there's nobody there, that's when you're like, now on Monday, the idea is that on Monday  we all get back and the thought still remains, man, Sal really stepped up his game.  Sal is a kid.  Thank you.  Because when this shit happens, it brings me back to being in my 20s and waiting for 
[00:30:30]  that dumb opportunity.  You never know when it was going to pop.  And if I was stepping up for somebody and doing their role instead of my who gives a fuck  role, which I had a lot of those coming up in the business, I would set an extra alarm  clock.  I'd get up extra early.  I would get to the fucking train or the bus stop early just to make sure I made it for  my opportunity.  Wait a minute.  What if it rains at WrestleMania? 
[00:31:00]  What?  What is that?  People won't get wet.  What happened?  I don't want to get wet.  I just realized I'm going to get wet.  It's not going to rain.  It's not going to rain.  Okay.  But we're talking about Sal.  What the fuck's going on?  It just hit me.  I just realized that.  What if I get wet at WrestleMania?  Sal's worthless.  What does that have to do about Sal not seeing an opportunity?  A lot.  Because let's just say Sal was an umbrella salesman and it rained at WrestleMania.  He'd show up at fucking Monday morning with umbrellas. 
[00:31:30]  Sal, you kind of blew it.  Because now we all are looking at you like, ah, one day that you could have stepped up,  you're marching down the hall at like 545.  You know, everything's going okay so far, I think.  What?  It couldn't be going worse.  What?  Because we're listening to Eric?  Oh, he's always deflecting.  You're obsessed with Eric.  The fact is Eric is, as much as we beat the shit out of him, he's irreplaceable.  The day Eric moves on will be a bad day.  Exactly. 
[00:32:00]  The only person cheering will be the fucking chair in that room.  So stop obsessing about Eric.  You're not even close to what he has done for this radio show.  You're no Eric Jiggle.  No, not even.  Nothing.  And that is always meant as a compliment.  That's what Sandusky fucking said to himself.  Yeah.  You should know Eric.  Get it?  All right.  I guess that's it.  Jim's tired.  I am always tired.  So we'll check in with you guys in a little bit.  All right.  Sounds good. 
[00:32:30]  Sam and E-Rock, live from WrestleMania.  Go play with your toys.  Yes.  Sam, give me updates on Eric all morning long.  That's all I want.  That's all I want today.  I absolutely will.  Keep checking your texts.  Right.  All right.  Yeah, thanks.  All right.  There they go.  Sam and Eric.  Mar said he wants to step up and be third Mike today, by the way.  Did you mean it, or are you just fucking bullshitting, too, like fucking Sal does?  No, I don't bullshit, man.  I'm down for the third Mike.  I could mispronounce more words than anybody else on staff.  What would you talk about? 
[00:33:00]  We could talk about what's going on in the group.  No, you can't.  No.  Why not?  You do it.  As soon as I walked in.  No, but by the time you see me, I've read a shitload of newspapers.  You want to talk about the Knicks?  No, not really.  No, I don't care about the Knicks.  No?  How about Miami?  You don't have a fuck about basketball at all.  No.  Okay.  Another team.  No basketball.  Another sport.  Another sport.  How about MMA?  Okay.  Not really.  No?  Okay.  The Knicks are what?  They've got a nice hot streak right now?  Yeah, they've won 10 already. 
[00:33:30]  They won 10 already.  10 in a row.  They won 10 already.  Well, I'm referring to the streak you're talking about, right?  Yeah.  10 winning game streak.  This is going to be a 10 winning game streak.  You can hear the radios turning off.  You said you wanted some mic time.  Yes, I'm here.  Well, this isn't good mic time.  No, this is not good, Mars.  No, not at all?  No.  I'm trying to talk about something.  But you were excited.  I thought you were prepared to talk. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, hell no.  I'm not prepared at all.  All right.  Then why would you suggest being on the show?  See, I'm on mic right now.  Thanks, Mars.  Yeah, but just being on mic is not enough.  That's what some people think, though.  There's a lot of things to cover.  Yes.  I think.  I think.  What do you got on Ebert?  That's a huge story today.  Huge story.  Mr. Jawless passed away.  That's so insensitive.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  Why what?  So.  Why is he missing a jaw? 
[00:34:30]  So how do we know that it's not going to rain Sunday?  How do we know?  Let's look at the weather.  So I'll just be stuck outside in the rain?  The forecast calls for 10%.  10% rain.  I mean.  Chance.  But it's going to be cold out there.  No.  I mean, the high is supposed to be about 62.  But yeah, it'll be chilly at night.  Why am I doing this?  It's going to be fun.  It will be fun.  Why am I going to sit?  Just wear extra socks.  You'll love it.  You've never been to a WrestleMania?  No, but the ring is covered with a fucking top, right?  How much of the audience is covered with a top?  Zero.  Why?  Because that's how the stadium was built. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's an outdoor stadium.  But I really wouldn't worry about rain.  It's not going to rain.  I wouldn't.  But it's going to be cold.  Yeah, it's going to be cold.  I'm not going to enjoy that, sitting in the cold.  You want them to warm it up just for you?  I think it'll be all right.  Wear your jacket.  That's fun.  Yeah.  Sit that door in someone's yard with my fucking coat on.  It's going to be fun.  It's not going to be fun.  Yeah, it is.  We'll get some of your winter stuff.  You got, like, a winter hat.  I do.  All right.  You got gloves?  Yeah, but who wants to do all that? 
[00:35:30]  That's why people go to football games.  I know.  I want to sit indoors and cheer.  I think it's going to be pretty warm, though, with all those people there, too.  I think you'll be fine.  Oh, I don't know.  It's going to be miserable.  You're going to sit there in a coat, and you're going to look at Fandango.  You got great seats.  Where are we sitting?  Show me.  I'll decide if I'm going.  You're, like, you're the first level up, third row.  How come we're not on the floor?  Wait, we're not on the floor?  I think you'd rather be there, because if you're on the floor, you're level with everyone.  Yeah, but the ring is tiny.  You got to be really close.  And that's where the celebrities sit on the floor. 
[00:36:00]  That's right.  Why are we never part of the...  No, the celebrities obviously sit in the third row on the first level.  You sure?  That's where you guys are.  Yeah, but a lot of these events were always just outside the celebrities.  I'm not trying to spin this.  I hate knowing I'm almost a celebrity.  You would rather be...  I'd rather be a nobody or a celebrity, not a almost celebrity.  The ring is right here.  Yeah.  You guys are right here.  That's far.  That's off the field.  It's not far, because I'm going to show you the photo. 
[00:36:30]  That would be beautiful seats for a Jets game.  Beautiful.  I would love those seats for a Jets game.  No.  No, but I'm saying, when you're not on the field, you're elevated above everyone else.  I would rather have an elevated view.  I've seen UFC close up.  I've seen it from the third row, and I've seen it from fucking the first level.  I was in the second row for WrestleMania in...  Where the hell was that?  Anaheim.  Huh?  You're going to be like right there.  Wow.  That's horrible. 
[00:37:00]  That's great.  So you've got bad seats, and you're going to get rained on, Jimmy.  Like right here.  Like that's literally your seat.  Why are we not in the fucking ground where the celebrities are?  Not that we're celebrities.  I just want to meet them.  Oh, I see.  You're going to WrestleMania for photo.  Yeah, of course you is.  I don't know if they'll be into celebrities or anything.  They invite a lot of celebrities, and they're all on the floor.  Yeah.  Or they're in boxes.  No, they're on the floor because they want to get them on camera.  They're in warm celebrity boxes.  No, they'll be down low because they want the camera time, too, because a lot of people watch WrestleMania. 
[00:37:30]  I remember this from the Anaheim show we went to many, many years ago.  Yeah, those are great seats.  We were sitting right next to one of the Jackson brothers.  Forget which one.  He went in the first raised level.  We were in the second row, and then Michael Clark Duncan was sitting right next to us.  There were so many celebrities right around us for that one.  We're not in Celebrity Row.  No.  We're not even in the same row.  Is Sam sitting with us?  No.  Where is he sitting?  In a box, right?  Well, yeah.  Sam's got a press box and friends and family box. 
[00:38:00]  How do you have friends and family?  Because he's very in with the WWE.  He told me he was going to bring me to that section.  Well, maybe he will.  Maybe he's just keeping it as a surprise.  I don't even know if I can.  How come WWE didn't give us friends and family?  Yeah, we're friends.  We promote everything they do.  Would you rather be in a box all the way up high with a bunch of other people, or would  you rather have your own seat?  Have my own seat.  That's what they did.  I don't even know if I can go.  I mean, look, the press box where...  You gotta go.  I wanna go.  Yeah, go. 
[00:38:30]  You wanna watch my kids?  No, I gotta watch mine.  Exactly.  I gotta...  I gotta situation.  I don't know if I could get a babysitter in time.  And my wife's got stuff going on, so...  I don't know if I could...  I don't know...  Who could watch my kids?  You gotta get someone.  You have a huge family.  TV?  What?  TV.  Yeah, leave them in front of the TV.  Put them in front of the TV?  That's not bad.  Yeah, just tell them to keep it down.  I need someone to watch my kids, so I can go to WrestleMania with the guys Sunday.  You have a very large family.  And already, Roland doesn't give a fuck about my plight. 
[00:39:00]  He's already trying to get my ticket, knowing that I might have a tough time fucking getting  a babysitter.  Does he wanna go?  Badly.  Does he?  And he heard through the grapevine that I'm having a tough time finding a babysitter,  so of course he writes me immediately.  He goes, if you're not using the ticket, I'll take it.  He doesn't watch wrestling.  Huh?  He doesn't watch wrestling.  Why does he wanna go?  Because he likes going to big events.  Yeah, he does like just being there.  As soon as they announced that the Nets were gonna play in Brooklyn, he was in here the  next day with a Brooklyn Nets shirt and hat, and he doesn't even know what basketball 
[00:39:30]  is.  That's true.  Nobody buys into hype more than that.  No, he buys into hype big time, and then he wears his shit once, and that's it.  CM Punk is...  Yeah.  CM!  Yeah.  CM Punk!  Good morning.  Hi, buddy.  Sorry, it's a little too early for that energy.  I apologize.  That's what you guys are used to.  You work horrible hours.  Absolutely.  Can I give you guys an E-Rock update as we hear from CM Punk?  You know E-Rock, right?  Yeah, I remember E-Rock.  He's...  You guys can see me, right? 
[00:40:00]  No, they can't.  No, they can't.  All right, never mind.  Why would we have a visual?  I don't know.  They were talking about how E-Rock completely just wormed his way into coming to this so  he could see wrestlers.  Which is weird.  E-Rock, you should have seen him.  I go, they're bringing guys out.  E-Rock, so, you know, get ready to film or whatever.  And I turn around.  I see Punk walking to the table.  E-Rock's nowhere to be found.  And he's running.  He has to run past Punk to get to the table on time.  He wasn't here. 
[00:40:30]  Why?  I don't know.  There's bagels in the back.  CM, I gotta tell you, that whole Paul Bearer angle is amazing.  I love it.  Thanks.  I freaking love it.  And we've been calling the shots from here going, he's gonna take those ashes and  he's gonna pour them on The Undertaker.  And you did just that the other night.  That is sick.  Yeah, I know.  It's like next level, right?  Yeah, because the guy actually died.  Yep.  In real life.  That bear is dead.  I didn't kill him.  And then having Paul Heyman come out as Paul Bearer was a nice little twist. 
[00:41:00]  And Paul Heyman pulled it off.  Oh, absolutely.  He looked like, I don't know if you guys know who Sven Gulli is.  No.  He's this local, like, local campy, like, horror movie guy who, you know, like, would show  horror movies and dress up.  He looked exactly like Sven Gulli to me.  It was kind of a throwback to my childhood.  Like Zacherli?  Right on.  Right.  And even though you're doing all this horrific stuff, you still can't really completely turn 
[00:41:30]  the crowd, because they just love you, no matter what.  Well, you know, the rotten human being I am, I would cheer somebody if they dumped out somebody's  ashes to me.  I think that's funny.  You know, I would go, and you guys would, too.  You know, so, you know, there's obviously that demographic of people who, no matter what  I do, you know, it's never going to be enough.  They're always going to cheer me.  That's all, you know, that's what every person wants to do, and they see an urn with ashes  in it, as you just want to dump them on somebody.  Yeah, absolutely.  Nothing better to do with them, so it was perfect. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Have you heard from Paul Bearer's family with this angle?  When I showed up in Indianapolis, which would be, it was like maybe three weeks ago, and  it was just a couple days after he had passed.  His sons were there, yeah.  And I talked with them.  I'm sure they were cool with it.  They, you know, they were almost falling all over themselves to make sure that I knew  that, you know, they were in constant contact with officials and that, you know, he would 
[00:42:30]  have wanted the entire show to be dedicated to him, which it was, you know, the big memorial  and stuff like that, and, you know, I think that was the night I wrestled Kane.  Right.  And I actually, I stole the urn, so they were on board.  Nice.  Oh, good.  Good to hear.  Yeah, and they, you know, I think they get it, you know, this is pro wrestling, you know,  like, we want people to be outraged.  How excited are you to be doing WrestleMania in New York? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I think it's cool.  You know, I think New York's one of the better fan bases, obviously.  I mean, it's sort of home for the WWE, you know, it started in the Northeast, and, you  know, this is always, like, obviously when we do the Garden, it's a special event, so  this is, I mean, this is wild.  I'm excited that it's like in an outdoor stadium.  Well, Jim Norton's not excited because he thinks he's going to be cold or rained on.  I know, I'm going to have to wear my winter hat.  Yeah, just wear a nice, oh, your poor little dome.  Just wear, like, a nice Patagonia jacket or, like, you know, you'll be warm, Jim. 
[00:43:30]  So, now, let me ask you, people who, like, are really close, where did we get to sit?  Because we're in the first section.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out if WWE actually took care of us or if they're, like, going,  ah, just give them these seats over here.  We're not on the ground.  We're not on the floor, as they say.  Oh, you're going to freeze your ass off then, probably.  I probably will be, right?  Yeah.  We can maybe stick you under the ring with Hornswald.  I think the ring's actually going to be heated, which is interesting. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to keep the wrestlers all warm.  Maybe there's a chance the entire ring bursts into flames.  God.  I could always hope.  When you give people tickets, where do they usually sit?  Well, that all depends on who it is and when they ask, because I got some real asshole friends  who will try to ask me for tickets to WrestleMania, like, Sunday morning.  Right, right, right.  And I'll be like, yeah, sure, and I'll purposely try to give them the most obstructed view, you know.  For being assholes. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, but if it's, you know, it's somebody I like, I'll stick them in the front row or whatever.  Yeah, but to be fair, ONA didn't ask for WrestleMania tickets until, like, maybe two weeks ago  when they saw Fandango for the first time.  All right, you don't have to tell me.  And then they decided.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You guys are in on Fandango.  Hold on, I know what Sam just did that.  That's why I'm shutting him down.  Why did you have to tell CM Punk that we're into the Fandango thing?  That's the only, I mean, see, literally they've said, you, because you're fun to hang out with,  and Fandango, because he's fun to watch, are the only things they're interested in WWE. 
[00:45:00]  I think he's great.  Fandango's awesome.  I'm not going to lie, because CM Punk, you know, he's been an incredibly nice tour to us.  I always take a look at what you're doing in the WWE.  I appreciate that.  And then Fandango, that whole bit kind of was funny to us, sorry.  Have you seen, why are you apologizing?  I think it's great.  Have you seen the video of Fandango, of Jim oiling up Fandango?  No.  Fandango was in this week, and Jim lotioned him.  I lotioned him. 
[00:45:30]  I did not oil him.  He handed me lotion and needed it applied, so I was a helpful boy.  Did you apply it to the front or the back, Jim?  It was only to his forearms and to the small of his back and a bit on his chest, wherever the lotion was needed.  Well, Jimmy is just strange.  Jimmy's lying.  I didn't turn the camera on in time to see him lotioning his pecs.  Did I lotion his pecs?  Yes.  Yes.  I missed that shot.  I did miss that.  But not his dick.  I didn't lotion his abs or his dick.  No, you were too busy staring at his dick.  Remember?  He wasn't wearing underpants.  You know what? 
[00:46:00]  It's hard not to stare.  He's got those high-waisted cock pants that are very, very popular.  And they're glistening in their shiny pants.  How do you not look?  I think Jimmy just tweeted.  Did you tweet the picture?  Of course I did.  Jimmy tweeted the picture, so it's Jim Norton on Twitter.  There's a great picture of Jimmy staring at his dick as Fandango is kind of flexing at our door here.  I wasn't staring at his dick.  My eyes were sleepy.  All right.  We just want to say hi, CM.  I'm sure Sam will do a real, you know, interview for the wrestling fans.  Yeah, you and Chris are the main reason I'm going. 
[00:46:30]  I really want to see you guys.  So it's my first time going.  I'm looking forward to it.  Cool.  Yeah, well, it's always a good time.  I mean, WrestleMania is ridiculously huge.  So even if you're not into wrestling, like, the spectacle of it all is pretty overwhelming.  Yeah, absolutely.  You're going to love it, Jimmy.  I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Yeah.  All right.  Take care, brother.  Thanks, CM.  Good talking to you guys.  All right, man.  Be good.  CM Punk.  What time does it start?  I mean, it starts at 7.  Okay.  It starts at 7.  Yes, I believe that.  Anthony's going, right?  As far as I know.  All right.  I don't want to go by myself. 
[00:47:00]  I've got to go with somebody.  No, I'm going to try.  I don't know if we have fucking...  Do we have friends and family parking?  No.  If that, I would assume not because you didn't get any parking passes.  We didn't get any parking passes.  Why wouldn't they give us parking passes?  I don't know.  We're big promoters of wrestling.  We would have thought by now you had proper mic technique.  That's kind of your thing, isn't it?  See, I knew Sam would do a legit wrestling interview with CM Punk.  I'm sure he's not talking about Fandango's cock.  We don't even have wrestling passes.  You know how much of a nightmare it is to get in and out of that joint without a fucking good parking pass? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, it starts at 7.  I don't want to fight 80,000 people.  You will have to leave by...  You can take the choo-choo.  If you leave at 5 from where you live, which we can pretty much see where WrestleMania is going to be from where we live, you'll barely make showtime.  If you leave at 5.  Where does the train go?  The train is a nightmare.  Oh, is it?  This will be a good test.  I did the train once after a Jets game.  It's a nightmare.  Why? 
[00:48:00]  Because it stops at one place for a while, and then you've got to wait for the train that goes to the stadium.  Probably through Penn Station, Newark, right?  Penn Station to that...  I forget the name of the fucking town, yeah.  I just want to fucking...  They should have gave us some nice passes.  Oh, I wouldn't they give us...  They should have.  I completely agree.  Who do we know over there that could help us out?  Sam.  No, I'm talking about...  I'm going right to Giant Stadium now.  Well, Roland, if somebody could find out...  Roland might be able to get you some passes.  Some passes, yeah.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  We promote a lot of wrestling. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe Roland will trade you a parking pass for your ticket.  Yeah, but then how am I going to go?  That son of a bitch.  Like, he doesn't even care that I'm having a tough time finding a babysitter.  He's jumping on the opportunity for him.  Look.  Now I go to his text.  Hey, if you don't use your WrestleMania tick and no one wants it, I would love to go.  How about you help me find a babysitter, Roland?  Or how about you offer to babysit the kids?  Although that would never happen.  You wouldn't leave Roland? 
[00:49:00]  No, why would you?  Roland has seen my kids and he gets very scared.  I don't know what that's about.  He's smarter than he is.  I can't see him being a good babysitter.  Why do you get scared when you see my little kids?  Why do you get scared?  Because kids always need something and I have nothing to provide.  All right, fair enough.  Because they're like, help.  I'm like, no, no, stay down.  Stay down.  You don't want to pick them up and help them?  No, because then if they squirm, if I let go and they hurt themselves, they look at you like you're the bad guy.  You drain man?  Fucking Roland wakes up screaming, hot water, burn baby. 
[00:49:30]  You're one of those guys that drops babies.  I'm just scared of them.  I don't want to drop them.  No one's, you know, I think most people are kind of a little nervous and scared around like newborns and little babies.  How come we don't have parking passes at WrestleMania?  I have no idea.  Can we get them?  Roland, tell them how hard it is.  You have to go from here to Secaucus, transfer either to the train or the bus to take you to the stadium.  But I mean, why can't we get WrestleMania? 
[00:50:00]  And everyone else is doing that, by the way.  So then you're on a really long line waiting.  If you don't time it right, you can wait in the train or bus line for three, four hours.  Thank you.  That's what I, that's.  Like the Jets game, I was four hours.  Because I timed it just wrong.  I timed it.  And then you have to run around and then they start shutting down the gates.  Like you have to keep on running around the stadium until you go out.  There you go.  Yeah.  It's like three, four hours.  Secaucus Junction with connecting shuttle bus.  Yeah.  So that's like an hour change.  It's not fun.  I left the Jets game early.  They were getting blown out. 
[00:50:30]  The U2 concert, I missed the train.  And it took me four hours.  I'm not doing this.  So then I left early and I still had to wait for the next train, which wasn't, it wasn't  four hours.  It was probably about a half hour.  So I actually, even though I left the game early, the game now let out, but I was like  way up front.  Remember the Jets game we looked to?  And then I had to wait at Secaucus because the trains aren't timed out properly.  So then I was at Secaucus for about 45 minutes.  So I could see my apartment pretty much from Giant Stadium. 
[00:51:00]  It took me over two hours and that's the most convenient way back home.  And you have to wait till midnight when the switch is back to a regular train schedule.  Or you can just take a bus straight from the Port Authority.  Really?  That would actually probably be the easiest thing to do.  That takes an hour change too.  Yeah, but you know what?  At least it's just you're on a bus.  Oh yeah, but the line after is like a monstrous line.  I wouldn't want to take it.  You want to take a Port Authority bus to Giant Stadium and see WrestleMania?  You guys have fun.  I'm not going.  Yeah, the line's like three hours.  Maybe we can just get parking passes.  That would be the easiest thing.  Yeah, I think right now all the parking passes are gone. 
[00:51:30]  Because like all the VIP parking passes for every big event is gone by a month.  But we're the Opie and Anthony show, goddammit.  I know.  There's got to be one left.  I don't know.  We are so not famous.  No, just because it's like a certain parking pass.  We were almost famous about 10 years ago, but right now we are so not famous.  They throw us a ticket halfway in the middle of nowhere's land for WrestleMania without fucking parking tickets.  I'll check with one person for parking, but it's going to be tough because every media outlet's there. 
[00:52:00]  Roland, how about this?  How about we get a helicopter and we go over there nice?  That's Trump Jr.  All right, let's give him a call.  Because his dad's going to be there.  Really?  Yeah.  And where do the helicopters land?  I think they land right where they practiced that little time.  Oh, the practice facility, which is right there?  They land right.  You want to try to get a helicopter?  That's what you two did.  Let's use the next three.  It's probably two grand.  Huh?  It's probably two grand to go from the city.  Oh, no.  We're going for free.  It's like three ribbon tugs. 
[00:52:30]  No, we're going for free.  My goal for the next three hours is to get us a helicopter ride to WrestleMania and a babysitter so I can go.  Why don't you just get a car service?  Or why don't you get a helicopter, no babysitter?  Car service is possible.  Yeah.  I don't know if he wants to drive.  If you're going to go, you've got to kind of go early as well.  I would assume he would drive and stay in the city.  What am I getting at?  Would he drive to WrestleMania?  I don't see anybody wanting to drive to WrestleMania.  I don't see him wanting to take public transportation.  No, I see him wanting at least to get a car. 
[00:53:00]  Giant Stadium is convenient if you go very early.  And if no one else is going.  Right.  I mean, it's good for football games because a lot of people tailgate, so you could go there early and set up.  You think they'll tailgate for this?  Oh, yeah.  Sure, absolutely.  Any excuse to tailgate.  All right.  You have a good show today.  I actually just had this huge conversation with Vince McMahon about this because...  I hope he's talking about my parking passes.  You know, he didn't like the fact that I was going to be not with parking passes and Jim might have to walk and get shitty seats. 
[00:53:30]  If it's windy, he'll be cold.  Yeah.  It's not going to be cold.  It'll be fine.  I like those guys a lot.  It's going to be just an early spring night.  It'll be fine.  What do I do with my ticket if I don't go?  I can't.  I'm not going to not do what wrestling would want me to do because they were generous and giving me the ticket.  I'll give it to Roland.  Okay.  No, I could do that.  But will they be mad?  No.  No.  They obviously don't care.  Look where they put us.  All right.  We're going to break.  Do we have a good show today? 
[00:54:00]  I don't even know.  Jamie, who's in the new Evil Dead, who I cannot wait to see that fucking movie, is in studio.  And it looks terrifying.  And Chris Hardwick will be in.  He's got this show after The Walking Dead.  Talking Dead.  Talking Dead, which I have not seen.  And I'm like four episodes behind on The Walking Dead, so I hope he doesn't blow it.  Right.  Don't tell me.  All right.  And who's Pat Lafrida?  The King of Meats.  He's going to come in.  That's my nickname.  The King of Meats.  Yeah.  He's going to bring you different burgers.  He owns the joints in Cidney Field. 
[00:54:30]  He provides all the meats and everything.  Wow.  Very cool.  You know, I passed by Meat Obsession the other night.  Yeah.  14th and, no, 6th?  Yeah, around 14th and 6th or 14th between.  A tiny little joint.  It's super small.  I'll take the small.  Yay.  He's in to celebrate Hamburger Day.  Yeah.  What are we mixing Hamburger Day with?  Uh, we're going to have burgers from like four or five different places.  But we need the other thing.  Remember tequila and donuts?  Burgers and what?  What's the other thing?  Diet Cokes?  What's the other thing? 
[00:55:00]  Kisses?  Hawaiian Punch?  Pink Lemonade?  Ooh.  They're embarrassing us to be out to eat with Kenny in all these places, and he's like,  could I have a lemonade, please?  It's such a childish drink.  I love lemonade.  I know, exactly.  Kenny loves, fucking, sweet Kenny loves a lemonade or an apple juice.  It's amazing.  He's got fucking brass knuckles in his pocket.  He puts an apple juice.  Give us sippy juice.  Two perps.  When we were in Boston, we were eating breakfast.  He was so annoyed that his bacon was greasy.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  And he kind of made the waitress very uncomfortable.  And she was mad.  I have the Louis concert for you on HBO.  What?  The Louis.  What happened?  I got it before you.  Oh, you got a copy of it?  Can't I just watch it on HBO?  You can watch it on HBO.  Two weeks.  Oh, it's two weeks out?  Yeah.  Oh, and Vice is tonight, right?  Vice might be...  Vice is on HBO tonight getting really, really good reviews.  Oh, these are positive reviews?  Good.  Really good reviews.  I saw three and a half stars in one of the papers. 
[00:56:00]  Good.  I think it's tonight.  Tomorrow, I want to guess, but I could be totally wrong.  No, maybe it's tonight.  I believe it's tonight.  Yes, tonight, 11 o'clock.  Tonight at 11 o'clock.  So set your DVRs if you're heading out tonight.  I'm happy those guys are getting good reviews.  Yeah, absolutely.  They're doing all right.  Oh, Punk is...  Oh, okay.  We did see him, Punk.  Okay, all right, all right.  Jane Levy is quite the looker.  Yeah, she is.  Sam pissed off a lot of people yesterday.  Who did he piss off?  The game one-on-ones, why everybody had to fight for interviews. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, because they all recognized him.  All right, we're going to step aside, take a break.  So you said Chris Hardwick.  You said Pat LaFrieda, the king of meats, the what?  The king of meats.  The king of meats.  And then you got Jane Levy, who's just really hot to look at.  So that means we're going to just fumble around when she's in here.  But we'll make something of it, I'm sure.  Oh, I'm going to give her a fucking good interview.  You are, huh?  Yeah.  So tell us about your childhood.  What was your worst fear?  And don't lie or I'll know. 
[00:57:00]  Just ask Hannibal Lecter questions.  Puerto Ricans.  You know what?  I got to tease.  You said childhood, right?  My sister's up from Florida.  And she reminded me of a nice childhood story.  That you had totally forgotten?  Oh, yeah.  There was a reason why I forgot.  She kind of made everyone uncomfortable in my house yesterday.  Does it rhyme with no festation?  Who was that? 
[00:57:30]  Travis.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  On Sirius XM.  The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide.  You know, as we move into the future, personal hygiene is becoming more and more important to our daily lives.  Why, look.  There is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton.  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen? 
[00:58:00]  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this.  And I arch my asshole out.  And I fucking open the cheeks.  And I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean.  Even on those extra messy days?  If it looks like there's still more work to be done, then I'll take a wet wipe or whatever.  And I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost up.  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know?  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp. 
[00:58:30]  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no.  I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean.  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I've learned.  Oh, I get it.  Thanks, Mr. Norton.  Ha ha.  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today.  I like a nice clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person. 
[00:59:00]  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow.  Fine films are meant to be enjoyed in a relaxing and intimate setting.  Something usually reserved for the prominent and wealthy.  I went by.  It was really fun.

[01:04:00]  When does he fight?  Yeah  In the true main event against Triple H  Oh, okay  So is that right before the main event?  I have absolutely no idea  Rock and Cena  Didn't they do that last year?  Yeah  Is Rock fighting Cena again?  Oh yeah  Yeah, they already did that  It's like G.I. Joe part 2  Yeah  Good for him  That's going to be one of those matches that you go and get a beer or something  Or check out the merch  Rock and Cena is going to be the bathroom break match  Yeah, Paul Heyman knows because they did it already  Yeah, exactly 
[01:04:30]  Who wants to see that shit again?  Not me  I'm here to see Brock Lesnar versus Triple H and CM Punk break the streak of The Undertaker  Yeah, Paul Heyman of course rolls with CM Punk  And Brock Lesnar  Yeah, and Brock  And Brock, I guess  You helped us get Brock on this radio show I believe through Ariel Helwani, right?  Did I do that?  I believe you did, yeah  Wow  Take credit for that, Paul  Helwani told me that I was getting him on the radio  It was for you guys  It was, yes, for us  I just, for the record, he lied to me  Oh, well, thank you very much 
[01:05:00]  So, uh  Was Brock actually in your studio or was it a call-in?  No, he was in studio  No, Brock was in studio  Which was, that's not an easy get  Was anybody injured?  Uh, Jimmy took a hold from him  He put two things on him  He put a knee bar and some kind of a leg to us  And both were remarkably unpleasant  Is that Norton?  Yes, I am the biggest Jim Norton fan in the world  Oh, thank you  Of course he is  Of course he is  I swear to God I am  Thank you  Anybody who's willing to fight Jesse Ventura  Is a freaking hero of mine 
[01:05:30]  Well, thank you, sir  And the whole time I'm hoping that he knows the Opie and Anthony show  But of course not  He has to go with the Jim Norton  Oh, Jim Norton's very popular  Yeah, I know you're popular  Is that the show that we're on?  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I gotta go  This isn't your thing, huh?  No, I was actually  Because they don't remember me  Because I'm not that memorable  But I was actually on Owen  About eight years ago  For the ECW one night stand paper  No, you were on Ron and Fez  I was on Ron and Fez?  Yeah  Way to go, Paul 
[01:06:00]  I think Opie wanted me  And Anthony wouldn't have me  Thank you  I'm a bitch  But if Jim Norton was around  I'd have been fucking front and center on that show  Yeah, Norton was  Norton was here  Norton, just so you know  I mean everything I say  I'm a huge fan of yours  Thanks very much, man  I appreciate it  It's my pleasure  Paul  Yeah, what do you need?  I love your Paul Bearer  It's terrific  That wasn't me  It wasn't?  No  It wasn't me with the Shield 
[01:06:30]  It wasn't me with Brad Maddox  That wasn't  You know, listen  I forgot  We're not allowed to give away the tricks  It was Easter Monday  It was Easter Monday  It was Easter Monday  The dead had truly risen  You know, the Undertaker has a lot of powers  And what I think is  The man overstepped his boundaries  And he brought Paul Bearer back from the dead  And then I don't think he really liked what he had to say  Oh, I see what we're doing here  Oh, I see  They won't allow it, Paul  They won't allow what?  So, Sam, you're the 
[01:07:00]  Is this like a no bullshit zone or something?  I mean, they try  Okay, I was Paul Bearer on television  And I liked doing it  And I hope I pissed a lot of people off when they saw it  Are you kidding me?  I would take credit for that  That was amazing  Thank you  I did a great job, didn't I?  I think you did a great job, yes  And I did see it  You know which county Paul Heyman lives in?  Huh?  Westchester  Oh, really?  Good for him  I try to bring up Westchester 
[01:07:30]  Do you really?  Now, do you guys really think The Undertaker's going to lose at WrestleMania  Breaking his streak?  I do  You do?  I truly believe it  I mean, it's time, isn't it?  Well, you would know by now  Well, it's 20-0, man  I mean, come on  I mean, isn't it time?  I mean, isn't CM Punk the right guy to do it also?  But, Paul, let's make history today  Okay  You already know what's going to happen at WrestleMania  So why don't you give us the exclusive before it happens?  How great would that be?  It would piss off a lot of people  CM Punk is going to defeat The Undertaker this Sunday 
[01:08:00]  And break the streak  There it is  And if I'm wrong  Have me on the air next week  And skewer me for it  I'll bring Jesse Ventura in with me  He and Norton can fight in the studio  Yeah  And we'll sit there and call the action  You can tell me how wrong I was  I really was scared that he was going to hit me  He's a fucking  He's a big angry guy, man  He's a frightening dude  Yeah, but he just had his hip replaced at the time  You could have taken him  Oh, okay  Oh, really?  Yeah, just punch him in the head  And, you know, he wasn't really in Navy SEALS, right?  Well, he was a UDT guy  Wasn't that before the SEALS? 
[01:08:30]  He says he was a Navy SEALS  Jesse was in the military during the Lincoln administration  You know, he just sounded like  Hear that?  One person laughed in the studio  It was like an engineer or something  One guy  One guy  I mean, Travis enjoyed that  Look, we're jaded  I'll tell you right now  That was very funny  But we're jaded  We just don't laugh at everything anymore  Hey, the Jew's funny  Go back to the Catskills  Yeah, I'll drive the veal on Thursday  No, that day  Jesse just sounded like an asshole  There's a reason for it 
[01:09:00]  Yep  He is an asshole  He certainly is  I like that about him  I mean, I think that's why the people  I mean, have you guys ever been to Minnesota?  No  I hear it's lovely, though  Yeah, you know  When it's 32 degrees in the middle of July  Yep  You're gonna be an asshole  These are just naturally bitter people  And they voted and elected a man to be governor  Who was as naturally bitter and angry as they are  It's an odd place  It's an odd mentality  That part of the country  And he was a weird  He wasn't even about him  That was just a fuck you to the system 
[01:09:30]  It's kind of like Ross Perot getting like 19% of the vote  That's just a fuck you to the other guys  But it's even different  Because he actually went into office on his wrestling name  That is true  I mean, think about that  You know  I mean, I guarantee you  If CM Punk decides to run for mayor of Chicago  He's not gonna do it as Mayor CM Punk  Ladies and gentlemen  I am Mayor Punk  You know  I mean, he's gonna say  Okay, here's who I am  But I mean, he went on his wrestling name  Wait, Jesse Ventura's not his real name?  No 
[01:10:00]  No  Oh, I didn't know that  I forgot  I used to know what his name was  Oh my god, that's funny  I think it's something like James Norton  I don't know  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Exactly  Wow, I did not realize that  So Jimmy's worried about his seats at WrestleMania  He's worried he's gonna get rained on  And he's worried he's gonna be a little cold  Paul Heyman  Can you set him straight?  You know you're a big fan of Jim Norton's  Yeah, actually  Well, Jim, how old are you?  I'm 44  Okay, I'm 47  So you grew up the same era that I did  When the Super Bowl  Which I don't really follow anymore  Because football is fake  Yeah 
[01:10:30]  But the Super Bowl back then  When it was real  Was always Bob Greasy  And Roger Stalbeck  And Terry Bradshaw  Throwing bombs in the snow  Yeah  I mean, you know  It was always in the snow  Back when I was a kid  And that's when I was following it  So, listen  Even if it snows on Sunday  Who cares?  It's an event  You go there  You have a good time  That's  You go outside  You know  You roll a couple in the car  You come back in  You eat a pizza  You'll stay nice and warm for the matches  But you're forgetting  That I've become a pampered twat  In my 40s  I've become a pampered twat 
[01:11:00]  I'm a gentleman  I don't like outdoors anymore  I like parking passes  I really am the worst  Then come hang out backstage with us  I don't have any passes  Yeah, we don't have any passes  Come find me  Fandango threw some tickets at us the other day  It was nice of him  Fandango  But he didn't throw the parking passes at us  He has no poll  Norton, find me  Come hang out with me the whole show  I love the find me guy  I know  You're the find me guy  How is that going to happen?  I'll go to security  And I'll be like  Could you just get Paul Heyman?  He asked me to look for him  Excuse me, mister?  Mister? 
[01:11:30]  Where's the guy who was on TV?  He told me to come get him  Right  I'll give Sam, not Sam  My assistant's assistant's private phone number  I was about to say that's dangerous  Okay, thank you very much  Hey, what do you think of Fandango there, Paul Heyman?  It's getting a lot of heat  I don't think about him  I really don't think about him at all  No  I don't  Why would I think about Fandango?  I have two clients that are in two of the three main events at WrestleMania  Why would I care about anybody else?  That's pretty cool  Is Fandango seeking representation?  He might be  Well, if he brings the dancer along with him 
[01:12:00]  And she has other dancers with her  I'm quite interested  If not, I'm very happy with the two that I have at the moment  Very good  Not the two dancers  The two clients that I have  The two dancers are replaceable  I hear you  Alright, we just wanted to say hi, Paul  Hi, Paul  Yeah, we're big fans  Well, thank you  And we'd love to see them park especially  What have happened to Ron and Fez, by the way?  They're still here  Are they really?  Yeah  They still hang out?  Yeah  Still on the radio?  Yeah  Satellite?  Well, Ron is  They're what?  I said, well, Ron and Fez doesn't talk much 
[01:12:30]  Fez doesn't talk anymore?  No  Oh, man  Yeah  Are you applying?  Like, make it, you know  No, he's still there  Like Ron and not Sam?  I would do it  But Fez is still there  Fez is doing some kind of wrestling angle  He's decided not to talk for 10 years  It's terrific  Really?  Yeah  And he gets paid  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, wow  This sounds like a good gig  It's just a wrestling angle  He's doing like kind of a wrestling angle  Slash Andy Kaufman thing 
[01:13:00]  It's brilliant  So he's gonna wait until it means something  It's like Clarabelle, right?  Yeah  You know, it's like the Howdy Doody thing  He waits for the  Goodbye, kids  And on boom  And I said, oh, man  He spoke  And went on to be Captain Kangaroo  And hung out with Pee Wee Herman in porn theaters  All right  Well, thank you, Paul  You done with me?  Yeah, we're kind of done  I'm severely disappointed you have  No, not at all  Not at all  Really?  Yeah, man  You told the world that CM Punk's gonna beat The Undertaker  Wrecking his fucking WrestleMania streak 
[01:13:30]  Hey, I'll go further than that  Brock Lesnar's gonna beat Triple H  I hope so  Whoa  I know so  Good  Yes, man  I'm giving you answers here  All right  So Brock will win  And so will CM  Yeah  Brock will win  CM Punk will win  And we'll take the money  Invest in some satellite stock  Get Norton his own show  That would be nice  I have my own show, actually  It's one hour a week  I'm doing it today, actually  Because Sam is there  I think we've gone contingent on Sam's schedule  I really am finished  You need to be on daily, Norton  Norton, you need to be on daily  Hey, let me ask you 
[01:14:00]  Brock's health is good, too  Because of the diverticulitis  He's doing okay  Awesome  Awesome  You know, this is actually the first time in his career  That Brock Lesnar's 100% healthy  Oh, good  The doctors discovered  That he's probably had that diverticulitis  Since he was about 18 or 19 years old  Oh, wow  So even when he was the NCAA Division I Heavyweight Champion  Even when he was the WWE Champion  Even when he was the UFC Heavyweight Champion of the world  Right  He was battling diverticulitis  They don't think his body was ever more than 60% healthy  Wow 
[01:14:30]  At its peak  Wow  Yeah  So imagine now what Brock Lesnar is capable of  That's not hype  That's for real  I'm happy to hear it  I'm happy to hear that he's doing well  Good, good, good  All right  Well, that's an uncomfortable silence, wasn't it?  No, not at all  I was just happy to hear it  I expected Sam to jump in  But I said I'm happy to hear he's okay  Sam's sitting here dreaming of going back to Scarsdale  It's 7  What is it now?  It's 7.30 in the morning  He's sitting there saying  Man, let's see  The train gets in 
[01:15:00]  It's 7.45  Is Sam asking the wrestling questions?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I'm going to do  I did my shit with CM Punk after you guys  I'm going to do my shit with  You're going to do the hardcore wrestling interview now?  Yeah, yeah  And you're going to hope the blogs pick it up?  Hope?  I mean, I'm all over the place  Are you kidding me?  I'm a phenomenon  So if I go Sunday  I'm just going to find  I'm going to find you  Right  I'm going to hunt you down  I'm going to go to the guy at the back gate  And go, look, you've got to go in the back  Right  He'll be with Brock  I'm giving Sam my assistant's assistant's private cell phone number 
[01:15:30]  You've got to tell the guy to leave his post to go find Paul Heyman  Could you go back there?  He's with Brock and CM  Two of the three of the most famous guys here  Could you get  Yeah, he has nothing better to do before the big matches  All right, well, I'll see you Sunday night  Yeah, right on, Paul Heyman  Thank you, man  Hey, thanks for having me on the air  See you, buddy  Come by and say hi  I will  Yeah, come by anytime  I'm going to take them up on that  I know  I'm going to show up with Brock and Punk  Dude  And, you know, we can muscle our way into that studio  Thanks, buddy 
[01:16:00]  All right  Very cool  Yes, that was very cool  A lot of wrestlers have really good taste in comedy  What am I going to say?  That's always frustrating  Well, they just, you know, guys like him and CM  They just enjoy a good laugh  What's wrong with that?  Oh, there's a guy just on Twitter  That's offering up his daughter to babysit my kids  That should work out well  No, I don't know if it would  Holy fuck  I mean, I appreciate the offer, but  I only trust, like, I think at this point my sister  To watch my kids  My other sister's up from Florida  Meeting my daughter for the first time 
[01:16:30]  And, uh, I don't know what it is with women  There's some kind of weird ritual  Where they have to change the baby's diaper  Well, it's probably their instinct  The first thing they do is just check to make sure the baby is clean  Right  That's probably just what they do  But they get excited  Like all the women that are, you know, in my family  They all, like, can't wait to be, you know  Be able to change the diaper of the newborn  What is that about?  I'll tell you what this is about  Because guys don't want to do that  When they change the diaper  It's all of a sudden  Inside they go 
[01:17:00]  Oh, this is what I was meant to do  It's the same reaction they get when they clean the toilet  Oh, okay  It's the same exact thing  When they cook eggs for a man  Right  It's just their instinct  What was the story that was brought up?  The, uh  Oh  This is your story  Oh, no  Well, my wife notices when I'm around my siblings  I, uh  I'm a little uncomfortable  And, uh  I come from a big family  And we kind of  Kind of  We kind of just  I mean  We kind of like  We don't get together a lot  And there's always this weird, like, tension in the room and stuff 
[01:17:30]  Because I think it brings us back to our childhood  And, uh  Growing up in a  In a wild, uh  Household  And yesterday  My older sister  Who, uh  Got  Got way more than the rest of us from my mom  Because of  A step  Daughter situation  I think  We didn't get  We didn't get physical shit  We got more yelling and screaming shit  And, uh  She told the story  Well, we were eating dinner  And my son didn't  You know  Wasn't finishing his meal  So I said  I'm gonna  I'm gonna break out the egg timer 
[01:18:00]  And my sister knew what that meant  And she started laughing  Basically, when we, uh  You know  Weren't eating  My mom would break out the egg timer  And we had a certain amount of time  To, uh  Finish our meal  But I don't remember what happened  If we didn't finish the meal  I think we just always were worried  That something could happen  If that makes sense  But then my, uh  Sister took that fun little egg timer  Bit  And then decided to, uh  Share with us that  In her case  If, uh  She didn't finish her dinner  Uh 
[01:18:30]  Before the egg timer went off  She had to eat it the next day  For breakfast  And if she didn't eat it for breakfast  Um  It was dumped on her head  Wow  And she had to go to school that way  Wow  God damn  Yeah  And I  I think I kind of remember that  Now was that  Her just  Her  Your mom's total OCD  About the food  Or was that her being cruel  Or just crazy  My mom was an asshole  Toward her  So she hates your mom  Or is she close to her still  She still tries 
[01:19:00]  What  I'm like  Why would you do that  Who cares  Give a fuck  Because she still tries  Yeah  She got way worse  Than the rest of us  Wow  But supposedly  Um  I  I believe her  The food would be dumped on her head  And then she would have to go to school that way  So she would try to  You know  Pick it out on the way  Yeah  Get herself together at the bus stop  Wow  Isn't that infuriating  Yeah  Because it  It went from a fun little thing last night  Because I remember the egg timer  And then she shared that  And then she kind of looked at my wife 
[01:19:30]  And went  Oh I'm sorry  No that's  Because you felt the whole energy in the room  Just go  Ugh  Yuck  You know  It's a great story  Kind of like the energy  That's being sucked out of the room right now  I'm enjoying this  Doesn't bother me in the least  I mean it bothers me that  You know  That was done to her  But  Yeah  I'm way past all that shit  So  Fox is interviewing wrestlers as well today  I guess this Wrestlemania is  Is kind of a big deal  Who's that?  Brodus Clay  Brodus Clay  Yeah Sam will be interviewing Brodus Clay as well 
[01:20:00]  You think Sam would know who he is?  Yeah I think so  He would know  He would know what his duties look like  Brodus Clay's duties look like  We have by the way  Jane Levy is coming in  In 11 minutes  She's a huge part in this movie  In Evil Dead?  Oh she is the lead  She's the lead in Evil Dead?  She's taking over what Ash's role was in the original  Oh I didn't know that  Yeah she's kind of  She's hot  I mean from the photos I see on the internet  Yeah she looks pretty hot 
[01:20:30]  Dude that movie looks fucking frightening  You want to see it right?  It's getting very good reviews  Good  For a horror film right?  It's going to be a horror film to get good reviews  You definitely want to see it  Absolutely  When's it come out Travis?  Today  It is today  Yes  I can't go today  I got a pop lock competition  And you got to  You got to go to like  North Face  And get all your gear  For the Wrestlemania  I just bought North Face  Are you kidding me?  I went and bought  I fucking spent like $600  On North Face recently  Because my jacket  My dumpy  I couldn't go to the comedy cellar anymore  Without Keith Robinson  Going hey stupid 
[01:21:00]  Stop wearing garbage bags  My fucking  Your bomber jacket?  My bomber jacket was awful  Plus me and Kenny  A couple of queers  We go on the road  You guys had matching jackets  It was so awful  And we always check into hotels  And Kenny would always tell the people  You know  We have separate rooms  Everyone thinks we're a couple of queers  He says that  Loud  And so I said  I was walking around  Like just go to North Face  And get a new jacket  You need one  Yeah  And I was so happy  With my decision  But I can't throw my old one out 
[01:21:30]  Because there's people  That don't have winter coats  So I want to give it to like  Goodwill  I can't throw clothes out  Because there's people  That fucking  You know  You know  When I bring up these stories  The phones just start ringing  This guy writes  My mom abused me  She made me eat my throw up  Oh fuck man  I don't  I  Let me hear this guy  This is fucking hot  I don't know  I mean  Is it true?  I look at  I look at my kids  And I just can't  Fucking fathom  Fathoming  Doing any of this shit  I can't imagine 
[01:22:00]  Why you would do that  Well you're not crazy  I know  How sick do you have to be?  How old were you James  When this shit went down?  I was probably about  Maybe four or five years old  And I used to sneak down  In the middle of the night  They'd send me to bed real early  So I'd sneak in the middle of the night  Eat Oreo cookies  Peanut butter  And shit like that  And then I'd get up in the morning  And they'd know  That I'd done it  But they would never say anything  And my stepmom used to feed me  Cream of wheat 
[01:22:30]  And I hated it  And one particular night  I just gorged myself  Girl Scout cookies  Whatever I could find  I ate that cream of wheat  And it got  I had a bad gag reaction  Was throwing up  She was standing over me  With a fly swatter  Kidding me  Saying  Don't you do that  Don't you do that  And you better eat  All of that  Wait she was mad  That you were throwing up  Yep  And where was your dad  While she was doing this shit  At the hospital 
[01:23:00]  He was a doctor  He let her handle  The whole discipline  And all that  So he was absentee  Absentee  So he basically  Just avoided her psychoticness  And let her do  What she wanted to you  Yeah  So did you hate him  For that  No  Actually  Believe it or not  It went further than that  When I learned  How to stand up  To the punishments  And stuff  They would like  Switch me  Or spank me  Or hit me with a belt  I would just  You know  Say that didn't hurt  Even if there were kids 
[01:23:30]  And they would start  Doing things  To try to break me mentally  Like put me in my room  Locking me in the room  You know  I'd breathe  You know  I'd find a way  To enjoy myself  And then they  Then they found out  I was afraid of the dark  So they put me  In the basement  And screw the light bulbs  And leave me down there  With no light  So what  Your father did this too  Both your parents  Participated  Yeah  Pretty much  He consented  To it being done  What shitty  Fucking people  He never did it  What the fuck man 
[01:24:00]  Are you still  Are you close to them still  I am  As a matter of fact  I live not far  From them now  For years  I didn't live  Anywhere close to them  And now they're  In their 80s  And 90s  And I live  About an hour  Away from them  So why would you  Still communicate  With people  Who are so shitty  Well  There's a small  Underhandedness  They're rich  Okay  I'm thinking 
[01:24:30]  Okay  They're gonna  Get some money  So I put up  With shit  When I was little  So I can get it  When I get older  Alright  You know what  Do they know  What you're  I hope they're  Fans of the show  No they're not  They don't even know  Who you are  I'm kidding  That was a joke  Hey  What do you do  For a living  You're not like  A serial killer  Or anything  Are you  No  I drive truck  Alright  So you're basically  A serial killer  In training  It's just a matter  Of time  Before you  Take one of those  Lot lizards  Lot  Lot lizards 
[01:25:00]  Right  And knock her  Over the head  With a shovel  Yeah I don't see  Three million birds  Anymore though  Wow that sucks dude  I mean that really  Is just  Just a horrible story  You know the thing is  I was talking to him  The other day about it  And I just kind of  Lay it all out  And I said  You know  For all the shit  That I took  When I was younger  It's amazing  That I'm the  Most obedient  And civil person  In the family now  Right  One of my brothers  Is an alcoholic  And another one  Has got a bad  Gambling problem  Yeah I wonder  Where all that  Came from  You know

[01:31:00]  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony show  oh fuck we could have done this later there so we got a big guest outside the studio  he's playing this because uh kurt cobain killed himself 19 years ago today oh we'll talk about  that later travis is a big nirvana fan so we'll we'll discuss uh jane uh levy's outside the  studio from the evil dead which opens today the star of the evil dead the star of the evil dead 
[01:31:30]  hello hi good morning how are you we're on good how are you good good you smell good i do yes i  walked by it too i went wow because we're used to smelling each other it's not as it's really  unpleasant it's not fun you smell very very good bring that into your studio so how long did it  take you to uh because i'm very rarely looking forward to a horror film like usually horror film  trailers annoy me but this looks fantastic thank you um and what's the difference would you say 
[01:32:00]  between this and the original i mean it's a different story it's a different cast of  characters different reason why they go to the cabin in the woods um i guess that would probably  be the main difference and there's no cgi right wasn't it all no cgi yeah it was all makeup and  practical effects practically you know magic tricks right wow really hard to shoot and it took a really  really long time wouldn't you have preferred cgi like wouldn't actors much prefer cgi in that  situation i mean at first i said oh this is so awesome you know we're actually reacting to things 
[01:32:30]  that are actually happening right instead of something that you'll color in later but then  you realize how hard it is i got a dumb question i've always wanted to ask it's not bad do they  like surprise you sometimes when you're on a horror film obviously you're a very good actress but do  they every once in a while give you a little something like all right she's she has no idea what  we're about to do to her yeah the director liked to play those games really yeah i'm nothing too  extreme i i take a shower and burn myself in this movie and uh the director wanted me to be surprised 
[01:33:00]  so he made the water freezing cold oh my god yeah i think i said he scalded you that's actually  no he didn't actually but he also he also made us this isn't like trickery but he would make us  jump rope before a scene so that our our part was pumping or he'd make us run sprints or  he made one actor we were shooting in the woods in new zealand and he made one actor go out into  the woods by himself for 20 minutes and not and he wasn't someone went and got him in 20 minutes but 
[01:33:30]  he was like totally alone you're in new zealand which is so isolated near the ocean in the middle  of the night and i don't know see there's some tricks yeah to get certain things that are just  naturally happening right pumping or being afraid or uncomfortable right oh very cool  it's kind of like what they do in porn they fluff this is this is like horror horror fluffing  was this your first feature like your first main no it's not my first feature but i've i've only 
[01:34:00]  really been in one other movie before this is the biggest part most responsibility i've ever had  which was terrifying how long did it take you 70 day shoot which is forever yeah that's a long time  nowadays huh yeah they they turn these movies around a lot faster than that yeah 70 days how long  are you in makeup makeup when i was evil um took five hours five to six every day every day but  i'm not evil every day i think i was evil 37 days no i mean every day you're you're playing evil it's 
[01:34:30]  five or six hours in a makeup chair i don't know how people do that what do you do what do you do to  kill time you learn to turn your brain off and you learn to become jelly brained really because you  can't do anything i mean you could listen to music sort of but right my palms were being painted  my legs everything so you couldn't wait so you can't check your twitter for five or six hours  that's crazy you could sometimes right i mean i don't have a twitter so oh why uh i have lots of  reasons yeah mostly it makes me nervous and every time i tweet i feel really self-conscious i had one 
[01:35:00]  i've had one three times are you a heavy drinker and you're afraid you're going to say really nasty  things no no but i i it is a lot of responsibility which is like a swipe i mean you could just do so  much care it's so you you could be so careless you could be careless very easily yeah it's a poison  world too i'm starting to realize it's not a good place well it's not a good place to be it's like  reading everybody's mind i mean we all have horrible thoughts and but it's basically reading each  other's minds in a way because you're saying things that you just think and you're firing them 
[01:35:30]  i know the worst part about twitter is when it becomes just a complaining session where everyone  just you're like i don't really need to know about but you had twitter three times i know you keep  going back in no i will never have it again i haven't had it for about a year now you're done  yeah what did you do wrong or what did you do what did you do that you didn't like i didn't do  anything wrong i just felt embarrassed you know if someone were to come up to me on the street and be  i saw you tweet at anything i tweet it was embarrassing to me that it sort of all feels like self-promotion 
[01:36:00]  it feels a little bit narcissistic and i know it's all those things you just named why i like it  it's all those things i know there's value to it but i it's not for me okay but then again when  you're doing movies it's like you really don't need to go out and you know to twitter i'm just  desperately trying to get the word out there but if you're doing a press junk you don't need to tweet  yeah now back to evil dead i just uh read a little uh point we have uh written down here you didn't  sleep and you had nightmares because you were so far away from home i sound like a baby 
[01:36:30]  but it's true yeah you sound like a baby yeah i was so far away from home and i couldn't sleep but  it's hard to wind down after all the the adrenaline right on set so what time would you start shooting  at 5 a.m well we if i had to go through makeup i'd be picked up around 3 45 in the morning  and then i'd go into makeup when i got there which when we were shooting in the woods took an hour and  then i wouldn't start shooting until maybe noon because of all the makeup and waiting for my time  that waiting man i don't know how you get yourself ready for the scene after all that waiting 
[01:37:00]  yeah well i'm so mad and uh i play a demon in the movies right yeah use that yeah sure you're ready  actually did it itch at all yeah totally that's it what was the worst part of it there had to be  one part of the makeup that you dreaded the most glycerin they'd spray glycerin on it i mean  every day i would have blood pus and ky jelly put on my face that's every date i have  which is the grossest combination  so uh okay so it was just it was just the feeling of all that stuff combined on you which was gross 
[01:37:30]  yeah you know and it gets stuck on your neck and your neck starts to stick to your neck and then  right what's the getting it off process it took an hour  then you have another hour yeah i know poor me that's a that is a rough way though i mean i  remember when not that i did a lot of michael jackson watching but when he talked about making  i think thriller or whatever it was it was just the makeup he said was a nightmare to sit there for  hours while they're just touching your face and someone breathing in your face yeah it's very 
[01:38:00]  violating with your space yeah yeah absolutely you get really close to those people you do right  yeah do you watch the walking dead i don't see i'm a fan of that show and that's one of the  most amazing things to everybody is that they use the no cgi that they use there's something  they've gone back to like the way romero did it and all these guys i don't know why but it seems  to be working well i think it looks better yeah and i think it makes you can feel that people are  really doing it right i guess it forces you to react to real things too like you said so maybe 
[01:38:30]  there's something more realistic about being close to the object you're reacting to yeah did you see  the original i did and did you like it i guess you did i loved it yeah it was one of the few  horror i'm really babbling but i love the original so much it's one of the few horror films that like  holds up and is there a campiness to this because the i think the first one didn't necessarily have  it like kind of the second one did where they're kind of winking at the camera but it's still scary  and gory was there any of that in this one yeah i think a good way to describe it would be winking  at the camera because the whole campy thing i don't think anyone tries to be campy or maybe they do 
[01:39:00]  i don't i don't think in the original when they were making it that's what that was on purpose i  think in two and three maybe it became a little more tongue-in-cheek but you know they just were  kids making a horror film with not that much money yeah speaking of the first movie uh people are  checking in is bruce campbell's character ash making a return unfortunately not oh no no in my  dreams in my wildest dreams he would be spoiler alert why did you answer that oh my god i know 
[01:39:30]  you see studio executives are now throwing their hands up why would you why would you say you have  to say like i don't know maybe i know to find out watch it find out what are you doing that's always  the worst when somebody writes a book they write a tell-all book and there's quotes all over the  paper and they're like well did that actually happen you have to read the book  i think the movie's gonna do just fine whether ash is in it or not maybe maybe ash is in it maybe  she's setting us up the other way absolutely so we'll be surprised scared see i helped you out 
[01:40:00]  right there usually when you see trailers for a remake of a classic horror it's an abomination  and this i i cannot stress how badly i want this trailer is horrifying and obviously it went viral  everyone saw it oh my god it's creepy it's hard to capture creepy anymore usually they have to use  that that that jumpy camera angle that anthony's always scared of like they used in the ring or a few  other ones it's it's rare that you just see something that's creepy on its own yeah absolutely 
[01:40:30]  yeah i'm really proud of it you are right yeah i'm really really proud of all of us but it is  honestly when you're doing a movie like opes said do they do anything you're not expecting but is  there anything that really is scary to you about or is it just such business because you got a camera guy  and a boom guy and all that stuff in your face it's really business it's so technical we were all  just trying to get through the day not scary right i mean i was buried alive wow uh that was scary  i mean we feel bad well how do they bury you alive well we did it a bunch of ways because of setting up 
[01:41:00]  camera i don't know but there was one way where uh fede the director what happens i don't want to give  too much away but okay fede wanted the director the director wanted one actor to know that he was  talking to someone instead of just talking to the ground so uh i wasn't even on camera but i was put  in a box under the ground about probably six inches underneath the ground and they covered me up and i had 
[01:41:30]  to stay down there with just my cell phone for i don't know five minutes and then the other way i did  it is i had a plastic bag tied around my head an oxygen tube behind my ear blood stuck all over my  face and i laid in a ditch until they just covered me completely with dirt get out of here no no lie  that's that's wow and how annoyed i was screaming like a demon the whole time how annoyed were you  when the other actors said what's my motivation you're like sorry you gotta get in the box  you gotta get in the box you need someone to talk to you you had to be freaked out yeah i was it was 
[01:42:00]  the one time i've never said no to anything in the movie but it was the one time after they put me  in the box under the ground i said i'm not gonna do it again i only let them do it one time that's  really that's the type of thing like you know a tragedy occurs yeah yeah no kidding that's horrifying  yeah especially having dirt thrown in your face i know i know i know i know and the director felt  like he wanted to do it so he was my tormentor for a month the director seems like he might be a  little twisted or a little sick huh bad man but you know i'm just totally kidding he's great maybe 
[01:42:30]  that's how he got such great like a great vibe he's smart there was something real about or something  uncomfortable for the actors well that's what he says he's like we were at we were at wondercon the  other day and he said do you guys want to see people pretending to be scared do you guys want to see  people actually be scared right which i guess is really simple but it's kind of messed up i did what scared me so  much about the evil dead and i think that you guys had this and this was the point of view  yeah that's the best when you're going with the point of view of the actual evil spirit or whatever 
[01:43:00]  it was i don't know why that was so frightening it's the best it was one of my favorite things  i've ever done i had to like i had to climb out of a swamp and there was a cameraman on a  zip line behind me and i had to outrun him and we had to time it perfectly or he would hit me and  it was just it was really fun now climbing out of the swamp was it a real swamp it was it was a man-made  swamp but it was outside and it was just gross they they heated it for me i had to heat a swamp  oh nice i got i got great quotes from you i think i like you man what it says on the set of evil dead  i think i had the toughest job i worked the most out of anybody most people were in their evil makeup 
[01:43:30]  for a week but i was in it for 37 days i was just there forever it's like you were annoyed  yeah uh everyone i had it worse than everybody uh no i mean it was hard right it sounds like it  yeah and then you talk about how you uh uh you would get drunk at night after you know filming the  the horror scenes no i think i said i should have gotten more drunk at night but you've got to keep  it light when you're not feeling okay when you're not filming you've got to get drunk or have one drink 
[01:44:00]  with a friend or watch comedy just to get away from it right yeah what kind of comedy i did watch the  big lebowski seven times that's a great movie good choice i don't want to know that the demon  was watching that's a great choice no you weren't you were just being evil i mean there was times when  i was a monster in my personal life definitely yeah and what did you do did you go out they're  telling us you have to leave shortly because you're not but did you go out in new zealand and do  other they film a lot of shit in new zealand i'm obsessed with new zealand yes did you get to 
[01:44:30]  check it out yeah i got to go to the south island yeah it's really beautiful people are  freakishly nice that's what i hear and it's something that's so haunting about it is there's  nobody there you know the population is so small and you're on this little island right like english  speaking people and it feels bizarre but it's i mean they say it's beautiful the most and the food  is really good really what do they eat there um pumpkin they have a lot of fresh vegetables and fish 
[01:45:00]  they eat pumpkin that was well that was something that i was so surprised by i was like i never eat  pumpkin oh pumpkin pie but that's it what else can you do with a pumpkin that was the worst pumpkin  with like that was the worst tourism ad for new zealand ever go to new zealand have a pumpkin  be alone on an island in the woods feel isolated so they do a lot of films yesterday there must be  something they probably used to it just looks beautiful maybe that's it yeah that's that's why i use it 
[01:45:30]  it has to be you do any of those outdoor activities no they do some crazy shit over  there that doesn't interest me nothing okay no she was crawling out of a swamp and a guy chasing  on a zipline it was like everything was probably just boring after that watching the big lebowski  that to me is so funny that's all i'm gonna think of watching that movie that was her going home and  just having a few laughs right that makeup on well this sucks you have to go we're just getting into  this uh well the evil that opens today uh everywhere i'm sure in the country and um i'm annoyed that i'm  working tonight because i want to see it uh this weekend so i'm sure it will sell out in most places 
[01:46:00]  because very again very rarely there's a horror film trailer get this kind of uh buzz about it  wait who are you on uh shameless i was in the first season but they recast me because i got a  different job but i played mandy milkovich they just recast you as the same as another person  i wonder if they're explaining that or no no no they just kind of no they didn't actually i'm sure a lot  of people didn't notice wow all right i'm sure they did yeah so you blew off shameless for what 
[01:46:30]  suburgatory what's that it's an abc comedy how did they let you do that in a contract what kind  of great contract did you have i'm going to commit to this unless you know she might only had a year  right yeah it was just a yeah recurring character as they call it right right right so you got a better  gig i guess so all right we got to get gene out of here gene levy thank you so much you're great  and the evil dead i'm very much looking forward to seeing bye bye on the next american war stories  battleground iraq robert kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war

[01:54:30]  anymore yeah we just don't have that done yet i mean it's just not there yet but she was on uh with  barbara walters yesterday and she seems like uh she's still under the influence there travis i know  you're a big fan of courtney love but she's just weird well she's always been weird does she have a  relationship with her daughter yet i don't know i i because she was saying on the view yesterday that  uh she just hopes that her daughter goes to college that's all she wants for her daughter

[01:57:00]  the song that break of dawn in it thanks  that's not bad it's okay  roland has entered the studio what's up roland  hello  roland sit over here 
[01:57:30]  roland set up uh burger day for us  yes burgers are on their way  isn't he the burger guy  he's palafrida  wait the burgers aren't here  no they're coming they're on their way  i thought the fresh i thought he would bring the burgers  but he wants like the last possible second for a burger  so i can travel  oh see i don't know this stuff  so if he came early  to me if you gave me a burger i would think wow this is great  no he came a little bit early so if he came early with the burgers he get on it'll be really soggy  so where are you making the burgers  uh a couple different restaurants were making them 
[01:58:00]  really  so we have  are we on  oh you're on  oh you're on  it's a couple different restaurants participating this morning  and uh making burgers to order so  what do you mean participating  yeah there's like four places  all right  four different restaurants  nice  actually preparing burgers especially for this show this morning  wow  they got up early  and  and do we have to judge the burgers or can we just have a burger  we're just going to be just enjoying it  just showing you uh the different types of burgers that are available 
[01:58:30]  do you know roland personally  no i don't  no  oh really you guys met today  yeah  and who are you  i am pat lafredo  and what do you do  i'm a meat purveyor  so i make the burger meat for many different restaurants in new york  new york city  now what makes a good burger meat  well a lot of things come into it but first of all  being  isn't it just chopped meat and you just fucking make it into a burger and throw it on the grill  no not really  there's so many different blends  there's so many different countries of origin that that  he looks very nervous  a burger meat is that where all the burgers hang out and get to know each other or something 
[01:59:00]  there's a club  double buns  double buns  no but you  you can  you  hamburger makers can put anything into a hamburger  obviously that's why when you go to a fast food restaurant you can taste that it's  you know  good  three dollars  three dollar hamburgers  oh no i just taste deliciousness man  are you kidding me  whopper  it's very hard for  whopper  restaurants in new york city to be able to charge eighteen dollars for a burger 
[01:59:30]  it's got to be different  it's got to be great  what's in uh burger meat that makes you go to the bathroom right away  and have a mudslide  not the rest  not the burgers we sell  but  those are the fast food burgers that you're talking about  no  it's quality meats  it's like amazing  wait you're  you're associated with quality meats  no no like his meat's like pure quality  actually quality meats is one of my customers though  yeah  really all right now i got some respect for you  i love that place  quality meats is a great steak place  great place  mineta tavern's another  yeah 58th street is quality meats i believe  and city filled he has his burgers there 
[02:00:00]  city filled  oh  delicious shake-tack  yeah was there yesterday they said that you guys have a suite there  where  city filled  we have a suite  that's what they said  probably serious  oh serious  yeah they said  we're not really part of them  no i swear to god we don't have a suite  i've never been to city field  and i'm a mets fan  i've been to the new yankees uh uh joint but  not city field  yeah  oh and you cook for city field or you you um  no we supply them with you supply the meat  right  and uh for the yankee steakhouse also 
[02:00:30]  so if you've been in the high-end new york yankee steakhouse  right  we uh do all the meat for them too  damn you must be doing all right for yourself  you've got some good clients  busy last few years  uh it was jackson hole burgers by the way  oh okay  i'll give them a fine plug today  the uh the burger was delicious  but within minutes i was on a toilet  yeah  within minutes my stomach was gurgling  and i had  quite a movement  not sure what kind of meat  so what's in that burger that makes that happen  i'm not really sure  but it could be 
[02:01:00]  anything  it could be imported  you know  mentioning this to pat  is almost like  if he was a beer distributor  and you explained when you got roofied  i don't know why  he doesn't want to talk about  explosive diarrhea  what's wrong with this guy  who did you book for us roland  i'm not saying your meat does this  i just don't cause the diarrhea  we can talk about diarrhea all you want  yeah  yeah that's what this show is  so uh do you butter  i don't like when they butter the uh  the buns  yeah i don't like that  it's too  it's delicious  but it's too much 
[02:01:30]  i i  it depends  you're right  they can overdo it  but i'm also the same guy  that puts a little bit of mayo  on my burger  so i mean  how can i complain about a little butter  on the bun  when i'm putting mayonnaise on it  fascinating  where's our burgers  they're coming  i know  my stomach hurts too  by the way  you guys have a crack security team here  because  oh yeah  they said  can you please bring a knife  to cut the burgers 
[02:02:00]  and i'm like  we're not a restaurant  so i i kind of brought  the smallest knife  we had  which is like a mini sword  it's sticking out of the bag  and i'm like  they're gonna give me a hard time  coming in here  and i'm like  you walked through security with that  yeah it was sticking out of the bag  that's the same knife  michael myers  are you kidding me  and i'm like  i get all the way  right into the studio  with this knife  now i like this guy rolling  well we all know  security in new york  is a joke 
[02:02:30]  i figured anthony would be  fumbling with his seven round clip  by now right  wow  no i mean  you know  security in building  it's just a facade  it's a joke  we all know that  give me your illegal license  and i'll give you a pass  to get upstairs  there you go  so what was mad cow  that has nothing to do with you  obviously  is that done  remember we heard about that  for a long time in england  and then nothing  yeah and then it became a band  um  mad cow  uh  has  never been attributed  rolling  we're dying in here  get the burgers  it's never been attributed 
[02:03:00]  to uh  american product  that was  uh  within 24 months of age  so  that's another big thing  when it comes to burgers  most burgers are  are made with  older cow meat  which mad cow disease  was discovered  in very few animals  around the world  but when people get sick  um  they  they panic  and right away  there's a hamburger panic  but  or a beef panic  in this case  um  it's nothing to be worried about  in american beef  oh no  i'm not  i was just curious  chris hardbrook is joining us 
[02:03:30]  could you save us  we're talking about  mad cow disease  with a meat guy  yeah  oh yeah  oh that's really great stuff  what's wrong with it  you don't know  you're going crazy  you don't know  your brain is swelling  i mean  you don't even know  the word encephalitis  at that point  exactly  if there's a family member  you want to get rid of  you feed them  mad cow disease  it's great  and that's what happens  your brain actually swells  huh  that sounds  yeah your brain  your brain swells up  against your uh  the cap of your skull  and then  oh wonderful  nice  which apparently  is not a good thing  no i don't think so  that might be a quick death  because that's what 
[02:04:00]  Liam Neeson's wife  thought of it  she fell  and she hurt her head  and it was a brain swelling  which killed her  i think  so does mad cow disease  kill you in like  a few hours like that  i don't know  if it's a few hours  no i think it takes  a little longer than that  yeah it takes a little longer  but man you hit your head  you gotta get some holes  you know punctured  into your head  to let some of that blood out  we're so fragile  that's what we learned today  we're so breakable  you're here for burger day  oh that's great  and this is the guy  that i don't know  i don't know who he is  i'm really hungry  we're trying to figure out  who he is  i'm starving too yeah  all we know is  he was able to get that knife  through security Chris 
[02:04:30]  yeah  and he said  they said  what are you gonna do with that  he said  cut Opie and Anthony's throats  and they're like  go right up there  that's probably what happened  yeah they actually provided him  he had a smaller knife  and they gave him that  Jimmy's so right  it's weird  they didn't even give him a badge  they just  go up the back elevator  yeah  he's held at the security  and he let me in  he supplies the meat  for a lot of big time clients  in New York City  and somehow we got  burger day happening  and he  did you supply the meat  for the burgers  i supply all the restaurants  that are gonna make us 
[02:05:00]  burgers today  right  how do you know  when you're looking at bad meat  where do you go  to pick out your meats  we go to farms  around the country  we visit the farms  so we know exactly  where our product's coming from  are they still shooting  the cows in the head  with that bullet thing  no no no no  how do they get rid  of the cows  they only  it's humane actually  they only make them  from cow suicides  that's right  and  it's all the comedian cows  who have the highest  anxiety suicide rates 
[02:05:30]  no they do  they do  it's called knocking  they do  they do  knock the top of the brain  it puts them out  as fast as possible  they don't know  what do you mean  knock  what is the process  it's a piece of metal  that protrudes through  with like an air hose  and it hits the top  of the brain  and the top of the skull  and the animal's  basically done  from there  why don't they just  poison them  oh that would be  answer my own question  or electrocute them  man  it's a very quick process  it's very humane 
[02:06:00]  what's not humane actually  is the halal  and the kosher slaughter  where they hang them  and bleed them  with a sharp knife  and they bleed out  oh my god  that's a little more  amazing  that a religion  just says go ahead  fuck the animals  bleed them out  that's just so silly  I don't know why  I had to ruin the fun  this cow owed me money  and you just like  you gotta hang them up  and bleed them out  and you punch them  like Rocky  while he's bleeding  and talk shit to them  but I'm hungry  and here's what happened  Roland said that  you want a burger  at 830 in the morning 
[02:06:30]  right Chris  absolutely  the burger guy is here  and we're like  oh good Pat's here  but then he came in  and we're like  no there's no burgers  and Roland goes  they've been on a plane  no here they are  he's FedEx  here's rolling  with the burgers  Chris thanks for coming in  I'm kidding  okay  this is Bill's burger  Pat Lafride  hello Bill  we actually like you  you know just  you know how happy I'd be  if you dropped those burgers  whoa  they look good  so what do we got there  Roland  we have sliders  I can't eat a slider 
[02:07:00]  why can't you eat a slider  I'm lying  I'm just trying to  and we have lamb burgers  I don't want a lamb burger  you want a lamb burger  don't we want just burgers  Pat  let's start on this side  here you go  oh thanks  is there lamb burgers in that  no no no  I don't believe in lamb  are there any regular burgers coming  yes  okay I'll wait for a regular burger  this is a regular burger  pass them around  it smells fucking  it smells amazing  what other burgers are coming  shoot I just ate breakfast  I don't want to waste one 
[02:07:30]  I don't want to waste one  no  you should have one  tell me how it is  I may have one  the burgers finally got here  and no one wants them  it's amazing  you should have it  where's the ketchup  it's in the burger  it's smell  and I mean this in a good way  they smell like White Castle burgers  they look like White Castle burgers  they do right  they actually look a little healthy  no we're acknowledging  we're not eating healthy right now  they're fucking good  they're good  this is my favorite slider in the city  so if there's a place to go for a slider  don't your listeners get mad at you  for eating on the radio 
[02:08:00]  oh yeah  we one time  one time early in the podcast  we had cookies at the beginning of a podcast  and you would think that we went on  some sort of a racist diatribe  because everyone was like  you evil piece of shit  and we're like  we just had a cookie  some people  it makes them insane  not some  a lot  it really bothers people  they hate it  I started turning off my mic  because it was becoming a problem  I don't have an off button  we try not to  but it's hard  because we don't really have  a regular day 
[02:08:30]  you get 15 minute commercial breaks  we don't get that here  they really really hate it  yeah  oh you're my  I mean you're my  they hate it  I don't understand why  here's why they hate it too  because they secretly hate us  and they know we're having fun  and they don't like that  some people though  for some people chewing  like the chewing food  is like  is like  on a chalkboard to some people  actually hearing other people eat  drives me insane  hearing other people make out  drives me insane  while they're eating  hearing other people come  in a woman I'm dating 
[02:09:00]  makes me hot  especially if I'm horrible  watching a girl you're dating  baby bird some other guy's  jizz into  it's the worst sound  exactly  makes me so mad  because you're like  what am I chopped liver over here  especially if you're  the designated driver  that night  yes  and how stupid  does making out look  when you see it  like when they do it  in public  it looks ridiculous  well yeah  you're just trying to  eat someone's face  blah blah blah  blah blah  you have to make that noise  I say 90% of the time 
[02:09:30]  that's the chick though  and the guy's trying  to push it off  a little bit  I think that's  that's the girl  trying to make it  no when a guy  like I don't know  it's it really kind of  grosses me out  to watch a guy  or hear a guy  like really get into it  because even like  like the cool  like the manliest  you know like  the biggest dude  when he's making  it's gonna be like  ahh  and you're gonna  like a rose  I'm gonna have  a nice diet coke  are you gonna have  any Roland  oh I had one  it's delicious  Roland had one  in the fucking elevator  they do smell 
[02:10:00]  really good honestly  Anthony you look  like you're suffering  no we're too traced  well first of all  I mean I'll be sorry  they smell good  go ahead Mars  Pat's trying to be  a radio guy  I love it  see if anybody  down the uh  in the hits  one wants one  too Sal  do you want one  you know you want one  you want to eat one  I'm good for now  I'll come in  during the break  holy shit  is that good  yeah I know  it's good  I'm waiting for another one  Bills  that's from Bills  from Rock Center  wow is that good  yeah  you sure you don't  want one Chris  I'm thinking about it 
[02:10:30]  they smell amazing  it'll hit you  don't worry  what's the other ones  that are coming  uh we have  Schnippers  what is that  they have a few  locations  great place  now the  we have uh  the Breslin  another awesome place  the um  but you guys are all  looking at me like  you don't know  I don't know  eat in the city or no  I do but I  only eat in a few places  yeah I'm not a foodie  I try to eat healthy  so I don't get around  as far as eating  at a lot of different  joints  I like sushi  I like vegetable  drinks 
[02:11:00]  I like oatmeal  and I have a cook  here's a cook  oh that's a very nice  type of cook  yeah  so I can eat healthy  see now Troy's  having one  it's kind of making  me want one  you haven't had one  yet Jimmy  no just a couple  of in shape guys  me and Troy  I'm kind of in shape  sort of  I got a couple  problem areas  but  um  every city  has to like  figure out  you know  where the best  burger is  by the way  all it took  was Troy going  one's not going  to kill you 
[02:11:30]  Jim  and people  are constantly  asking me  what's your  favorite burger  and it's like  they try to  catch me in that  and I have a  thousand restaurants  that I supply  every day  but didn't they  just announce  the best burger  in New York City  we lost Chris  who's going to be  at Caroline's  this weekend  I'll be at Caroline's  this week  eating burgers  on stage at Caroline's  how ridiculous  is that  it's like  a better  White Castle burger  is the only way  I can explain it  and I love  White Castle  yeah but  did they announce  it's funny  when they announce  it's always  a different group  we never know 
[02:12:00]  who those  they people are  no recently  it made  the news  it was a big deal  and it was  some kind of burger  where they deep fry  the whole fucking thing  I wouldn't want that  have you ever  performed at  Laughing Skull  in Atlanta  I have yes  okay so it's  attached to this  restaurant called  The Vortex  and The Vortex  has a double  coronary burger  which is  four patties  four layers  of cheese  four layers  of bacon  and the bun  are two  grilled cheese  sandwiches  holy shit  did you try it 
[02:12:30]  did you have it  it's incredible  no I didn't have  the double  coronary burger  I would die  I'm not a big guy  and I don't normally  eat like that  unbelievable  this is literally  like sex  without the impending  charges  where are the rest  of the burgers  they're coming  they're coming  they staggered them  burgers don't travel  well so we try to  make them as nice  of an experience  I appreciate it Pat  I really do  I really appreciate  the  Bill's is the same  group that  is associated with  Blue Water Grill 
[02:13:00]  and the  Be Our Guest Group  see I know  Blue Water Grill  I've been there  it's a fine  establishment  yep  Dos Caminos  and that whole group  sure okay  good people  well that was about  1500 calories  for a thing  the size of a  I was trying to  figure that out  how much  just mayo on the  damn thing  800  I'm gonna guess  800  you sound like  girls to our  audience again  what's the problem  you guys  because most radio  guys  you know  Chris was in radio  now you're podcasting 
[02:13:30]  but you're doing  way more than radio  when you start to get  older you have to  worry about those  things because your  body doesn't just  automatically heal  itself because you're  Wolverine before age  25 and then after  that you lose your  mutant powers  you know that's a  great way to look at  it but most radio  guys are completely  out of shape  oh they're total  slobs dude  but we've always  kind of given a  fucking yeah  our audience points  it out as us being  girls so  what are you gonna  do  this is what  self-centered asses  we are 
[02:14:00]  we had burgers  coming and we're  like thinking the  audience is gonna be  excited for us  more than I hate  our fucking guts  they're calling  guys burger day  like oh good  the guys get to  enjoy free burgers  give us a fuck  kelly and stan  jim norton's finally  gonna have that  burger  guys guys he  enjoyed it the  slider  pull the kids out  of school  and you know what  jimmy's 100% right  we've been promoting  this all morning chris  hey what's up  nicole and stanley t  for the morning mashup  what's going on  what's going on guys  good

[02:16:00]  they're bringing in  and like the crowd  is gonna be excited  and go like  i wonder if they'll have  the southwest burger  they don't give a fuck  yeah cause you know  we're doing comedy  when you go on stage  you're like  hey everyone  i just won ten thousand dollars  we were gonna be like  immediately fuck yourself  right of course  because yeah  they didn't win it  what do you got there  i had an apple  and some peanut butter  not realizing that  roland would awkwardly  bring in the burger guy  thirty minutes before  the burgers got here  is that dessert  after the burgers  no i was gonna eat that  instead of the burger  see we eat healthy  we told you that chris  yeah  yeah  i had a low fat protein 
[02:16:30]  smoothie coming my way  i had to cancel that  well that's what we call it  fucking chris hardwick  is becoming a huge star  holy fuck man  caroline's this weekend  right  yes sir  and i have not seen  all the walking dead  sorry to interrupt you  so don't give me  i'm like four episodes  shy  i love that show  if you haven't  i love the walking dead  i'm sure we'll be back  we did pretty well this year  so i think we'll be back  i'm addicted 
[02:17:00]  i cannot wait every week  are you addicted to the walking dead  or his show called talking dead  which is on after walking dead  on amc  i am  i'm addicted to the walking dead  not talking dead  not talking dead  well we're sort of a  well you could have pretended  you could have at least said  it's like  after the walking dead  part of the experience  but he made sure he said  he made sure a fan of the walking dead  not of the talking dead  which is his show  i'm just i'm just like  i'm just like the kid going for a layup 
[02:17:30]  and then the grown up just smacks the ball down  and goes sit the fuck back down  it's part of the experience pat  i work overnight  so i get done at six in the morning  i get home  i i go to my  but to what  netflix i pick up the walking dead  i barely make it to the end  and then i pass out  so when they say  stay tuned for talking dead  that doesn't interest you at all  he does not stay tuned  by the way  i don't like chris's subtle blow off  i'm like i'd love to do your show  and he goes  looks like we're coming back  of course you can come back  i kind of heard that too  you should come do the show 
[02:18:00]  i would like to a lot  but i require first class airfare and hotel  oh shit  he will come do your show  after he finds paul hayman this sunday  i'm gonna go find paul hayman  and get some good wrestling  yes  i don't follow up on any offers  yeah we don't know how we're gonna find paul hayman  but the offer's out there  hey uh  did you go  i just wanted to ask really fast  so did you go to amc  and go i got this great idea  no the show was not my idea  the  but it wasn't  it seems like it would have been  well as soon as i found out  that they were doing it  uh  i went after the job pretty hard  because i'm 
[02:18:30]  because i'm a fan of the comics  and the  and the first season of walking dead  and so um  i went after it really hard  yeah the show's made for you  it was  it's incredible  it's incredible  it's a silly job to have  because it's not  i mean i basically just show up  and talk about a show that i really like  right  and that's it  and it's the  it's the greatest job ever  yeah it's smart  really smart  i'm kind of  i  everything i do  now  is something that i like  working on  which is a weird place to be  because i didn't  when you look at  like the 18 years  that i've been working 
[02:19:00]  right  that is  that does not represent  the majority of those 18 years  gotcha  you got one of the most popular podcasts too  how many people are you doing for real  what  or tell me off mic  how many  how many people are listening to your podcast  i don't know  it's a  a week  probably  per episode  well i  i know we do about  i'm asking  probably close to 5 million downloads a month  holy fuck  it's huge  um  that's that's more  that's more than what we're talking to  well i don't know about  i don't know  come on 
[02:19:30]  nah  they  they've never told us  well it was  it wasn't until we all started eating on the air  we've lost a few  well i'm just opening  i had a peanut butter in the back  and he bought me another one  how much fucking peanut butter does this kid think i need  i didn't have a dog  you're a peanut butter millionaire  you've got to save room  there are more burgers coming  i know that's why i'm eating this  so i won't have to pig out into the burger  Kelly it's Adam again  jim finally got that peanut butter  and he's got an extra one  no no no  but they're gonna call this  the apple peanut butter break  they're gonna be very happy  the apple peanut butter gang  it's amazing 
[02:20:00]  we're gonna form a club  hey what happened to the fucking network you were on  i really  G4  I enjoyed that man  gone  the whole network's gone  whole network gone  why  because  was it too niche  well  there were a lot of problems  it was great  G4 was fun  there were a lot of problems with it though  being that  it didn't really have a budget  to create a lot of original programming  so most of the programming on G4 was  you know  old episodes of cops and cheaters  and then  at night  there were a handful of shows  that they could produce  and then  DirecTV and Comcast 
[02:20:30]  got into this battle  and so  DirecTV dropped G4  so now G4  is not even available  in most of the country  and you have to subscribe  like it's an extra  so when you look at who the demographic for G4 is  you're like  you know  young people  young nerdy kids  who probably  are usually  probably watching a lot of stuff online  don't even  or not spending $120 a month on cable  yeah we  that's why we don't have 5 million listeners  so that's  because it's an extra step to listen to us  it's an extra step 
[02:21:00]  so  I mean we're on XM  nice  but then Sirius  and I guess there's a lot of people out there  with Sirius radios  I don't know  of course I know  but you have to buy the  now best of XM package to get us  to a Sirius radio  so that  it's an extra step  extra steps never work  in your favor  if you're trying to be creative  and talk to as many people as possible  and even if people have the money  it's still an extra step  right  and so  yeah I explained it  Louis C.K. went on a rant about this company  because they're doing some things wrong  a lot of people see it too 
[02:21:30]  and  I brought up the fact that  I don't have  my own show in my car  because I don't feel like dealing with it  oh yeah  I got a Sirius radio  and I don't  I could walk down the hall even  I just don't want to fucking deal with it  so I don't have it  I didn't  I didn't have G4  because I had DirecTV  and I was like  am I going to switch over now  exactly  yeah  so it's a  it's a pain  and you gotta  you gotta fit  and you gotta like  for this company  you gotta pick out a car  and the radio  and hope they match up  right  like if you like a particular car 
[02:22:00]  but they have XM  but you want Sirius  you're fucked  well particularly now  because people are so  we're so conditioned  to just have everything  be as convenient as possible  right  no one wants to make  an ounce of extra effort  to do anything  so it's like  I'll sit on the couch  if it hits me in the ears  or the eyes  fine  I love telemarketers  their opening line  is free cruise  you just gotta do  click  because I know  even if they're telling the truth  and I'm gonna get a free cruise  I know it's gonna be  too much of a fucking hassle 
[02:22:30]  all you have to do  is answer a true or false  no click  yeah you quickly hang up on them  and that's their opening line  free cruise for you  and your family  oh it must work  I guess  otherwise they wouldn't keep doing it  it must work  and some people must go  oh I want a free cruise  right yeah  there's still people  I'm sorry  there's still people  that lose a Nigerian  fucking email scams  of course that cruise thing  still works  people believe anything  yeah but at what point  did they start to call  our cell phones  that's when I think  everything went down  oh my god  I get so mad  because I'm on the do not call list 
[02:23:00]  and there's one company  there's no such thing  as a do not call list  there's not anymore  and I'm on the company's list  where when I see the number  and it's from some weird area  and they're always like  stay hang on  to lower your credit card  and then if you talk to them  and you go  hey how'd you get my number  they hang up  because they're not supposed  to be doing it  oh really  I make my two year old daughter  answer those phone calls  and she's like  I just did duty  and the guy's like  can I speak to your parents  but they're relentless  they just don't hang up  it just makes me wish  I had a team of hackers 
[02:23:30]  at my disposal  to track down  the telemarketers  and just be able  to call them right back  and go  hey you just hung up  with me a second ago  we're coming to your weird warehouse  in rural Massachusetts  holy shit  more burgers have arrived  for burger day  snippers  I'm looking at the women  not the burgers  hi ladies  hey Pat  beat it  these are large burgers though  like the slider  the slider was just  the right  oh no I can't  I can't  I'm so  I don't know how much 
[02:24:00]  how many burgers  are we supposed to eat  the smash burgers  it's burger day  you had one slider  where are you going  and Opie's already  calling in a  you're leaving  what  who are you two  get back in here  I work for Pat  why are you guys panicking  we don't bite  no  how old are you  25  okay you're old enough  why are they panicking  well I'm not sure  Tyra get back in here  is that your girlfriend  no  are you married  no  you want to go out  oh my god  Chris you're going to 
[02:24:30]  want to look at this  you like to be single  I don't want to  I don't need for anything  physical  I mean just do what I need  is it nice  what are we eating right now  she's good  she's good  delivering you hot burgers  at this time in the morning  I know she's great  it's like she's heard  that question a million times  in her life  she pointed at my burger  with her coat still in her hand  and said aren't we eating right now  which is go ahead  fat boy  you thought I was being slippery  about talking dead  put that right there  he's like oh are you guys eating  and then when we all turned around  she ran out  yeah she's good  she knows  Roland what's a smash burger  you said that 
[02:25:00]  I have no idea what a smash burger means  it's different  like they smash it  he's just guessing  because of the title of it  they throw it against the wall  he has no idea what that means  how do you not know  what a smash burger is  but you hand it to me  all excited  you went this is a smash burger  they get it really drunk  and they put it behind the wheel of a car  smash burgers  when they take a taller hamburger  and put it on a flat top  and squish it down  and it's supposed to get  a nice char all around  the top and bottom of the burger  now we got two  we got two different burgers  in front of us 
[02:25:30]  I'm not going to be able  to eat three burgers Pat  which one  should I go smash burger  or the other one  I've been a burger judge  so many times  all you need to do  is take a bite of each  oh yeah that's going to happen  that's a great title  burger judge  there's a lot of burger competitions  it's amazing  the city went burger crazy  and for New York food and wine  there's like 5,000 people show up  at $300 a ticket  gets sold out in 30 minutes  and  burger judges  and then there are  like prestigious  burger judges  for thinking of burger crimes 
[02:26:00]  so you have your king  burger judges  I got out of judging burgers  because it's usually  30 of my customers  all looking at me like  I'm the winner right  oh really  you like the park meridian  and what they do with their burgers  in that little joint  in the lobby  Pat's making a disgusted face  he's not happy  I'm not very  I'm not impressed  the lines are out the door  every day  the lines are longer  at the Shake Shack  I would say  Shake Shack has a good burger  I got one of those 
[02:26:30]  in my neighborhood  I helped develop that concept  did you really?  yep  holy fuck  you get a little of the action?  oh they buy the meat  from me every day  so it's  that's not the real action  you didn't get a taste  of the company?  why are you not a reality show?  like there's every other  kind of process  reality show  why isn't Burger Judge  or Meat Mafia  Meat Guy  we actually have a reality TV show  called Meat Men  so  I'm brilliant  I just didn't know  that that already existed  wow you guys are really  throwing passive aggressive jabs  at these other TV shows 
[02:27:00]  no I don't watch your show  why don't you get a reality show  oh you have one  didn't know  all the viewers  I just held up a key card  hang on a second  does Meat Men have an after show?  I'll host it  it's called Talking Meat Men  I didn't watch it  except it was M-E-E-T  I love it  because I watched  The Walking Dead  but not  The Talking Dead  as the host of the show  is right in front of your  fucking face  that's alright  are you part of Meat Men?  I would say  I'm part of Meat Men  so you're not even part 
[02:27:30]  of the reality show?  yeah no I am part of it  it's my father  myself  and my cousin  are you guys just doing it  on a camcorder  for yourselves?  where can people see this thing?  Food Network  you're on the Food Network?  yep  oh wow  look at you  we were a little risque  where they would say  that we were a family network  it's very nice to be here  and speak your mind  and say whatever you want  but  I wonder if my sister knows you  at one point  she loves the Food Network  at one point they told me  hey you gotta speak to your dad  and your cousin  I was like  what's wrong?  they said  we can only use about 15%  of their content 
[02:28:00]  oh really?  I'm like  hey guys  you either have to tone it down  be a little bit more  politically correct  or they're not just  they're not gonna air you  that's not how meat men are  meat men  meat men say what they  fucking feel like  exactly  my father was a meat man  and I'm a meat man  we talk like meat men  meat men  that was  I only had that little slider  but that was very delicious  you wanna try the smash burger?  no I do  I want to  but I won't stop eating it  maybe a couple bites  how's the smash burger? 
[02:28:30]  it's delicious  is it better than the slider?  personally I like the slider better  but this is still a very good burger  Troy?  smash burger or slider?  there's bacon on this shit  and mayo  the slider just is a perfect amount of burger  it's so juicy  well I would've had another fucking slider  but the morning mash up  took our tray  there's bacon and lettuce on the smash burger  and cheese  what is that?  what is this?  that's a good question  there's no  what is this one?  that's just a burger  where are the girls women?  I scared them out  I didn't mean to 
[02:29:00]  I was just kidding  yeah why wouldn't they hang with us?  that's that creepy guy in a bar  why do they hate me so much?  I was just being friendly  wait now you're calling Jimmy creepy?  no he's right  no no no  Troy are you going to take that shit?  that's my perception of what they were thinking  no they're absolutely right  oh okay  it was a good call by the girls  yeah  who's that creep?  well you know me  that's the Citi Field Amazenburger  oh wow  oh that's what you guys serve at Citi Field?  yes  holy fuck  Jesus  it's huge  and there's the big knife again 
[02:29:30]  yeah  there's the fucking  the fucking Simpson murder weapon  how much  how much  how much meat do you have to  send out every day?  how much meat do you go  send out every day?  every night  we work at night  every night  we process about  100,000 pounds of  of beef  Jesus  we send out  so  how do you process beef?  you grind it  form it  portion it into steaks  we have a dry age room  that holds 6,000  primals  do you have a quarter? 
[02:30:00]  a quarter  where's your  operation located?  we were in Manhattan  until 1920  I'm promoting a meat factory  by the way Chris  yeah  we were located  in New York City  since 1922  and  they even renamed  Leroy Street  Pat LaFreda Lane  and  then  some schmucks  thought  hey  let's put bicycle lanes  in front of  LaFreda's loading docks  so every morning  while our trucks  were loading  we would get  $2,000 worth 
[02:30:30]  of parking tickets  wait but your loading  doc was there  before the bike lane  you think they care about that?  no I know the city  doesn't give a fuck  about any of that shit  you do think there's  one fucking bicycle  driving down  Washington Street  at 630 in the morning  not a one  but they're waiting  for you to fucking  block the bike lane  right?  overweight traffic cops  waiting  to nail my  trucks every morning  $2,000 a day?  yeah and  what most people  don't know  is that  parking tickets  are not tax deductible  for a business  so  it's like  you pay your taxes 
[02:31:00]  and then  it comes off  the bottom line  because it's  in quotes  a violation  why don't you  bribe them in meat?  oh  it wasn't  NYPD  they were always  fed  they always had  burgers stocked up  it was traffic  gotcha  but  weren't you  zoned for a  loading dock  situation?  not only zoned  they renamed  the street  after us  they built  a beautiful  condominium  across the street  where the  Eva Mendes  lived 
[02:31:30]  and the Olsen  twins  they used to  send their  boyfriends  across the street  to complain about  like the noise  we're like  what noise?  what are you  talking about?  it's New York  City  what noise?  probably the cows  begging for their  lives  we would beat  the animals  before we  killed them  hey is it  true  that you  go down  to the court  and negotiate  your parking  tickets  we've heard  that over  the years  oh yeah  we do  it's a good  scene in  one of our  shows where  my dad  actually walked 
[02:32:00]  in with a  box of burgers  for a parking  judge  the guy was a  vegetarian  oh really?  but what they  did was they  raised the  tickets from  $115 to  $125  so then you  get the ticket  for $125  and they're like  oh you have a  fleet of trucks  we'll reduce  that to $115  we're like  well that's  what it was  what are you  talking about  so they don't  reduce it a lot  nah there's no  savings at all  so they chased  you out of the  city  they chased me  out of the  city  we moved to  North Bergen  New Jersey  which is like 
[02:32:30]  three miles  from the  original plant  it's right  through the  Lincoln Tunnel  and then I  run into  Mayor Bloomberg  and he's like  good luck in  New Jersey  I'm like  you sound like  it's a bad  thing  you threw us  out of the  city  and then you're  mad that we  left  and went to  the 6th borough  which is New  Jersey  it's a different  environment there  the cops pass  by  they wave  the city is  gouging you  for money  and then mad  that you leave  what fucking  idiots  pissed 
[02:33:00]  pissed  we've been there  since 1922  they're in  the street  after us  did you say  to him  ok well then  call off the  traffic cops  we'll come  back  yeah  you know  when he's  surrounded by  security  you say  very little  but  we will  enjoy  New Jersey  you should  enjoy  New Jersey  that's unbelievable  because every day  on the way home  you see all the  delivery trucks  and they all  have parking  tickets  it's such a  fucking scam  it would be  impossible for  those trucks  to find any  type of  legal parking  and they know  that  and they know  all that  shit  what's impossible 
[02:33:30]  is that  this is an  island  and it needs  to be supplied  we even  delivered  the day of  Hurricane Sandy  because New  Yorkers need  to eat  we needed  the restaurants  that were open  and had  electric  they needed  to cook  people were  starving  and we were  there for them  so it's  the best move  we made  could all the  businesses ever  get together  and just say  hey we're  going to  protest  you want  to ticket us  as a cluster  of businesses  we're not  going to deliver  anything into  the city  you know what 
[02:34:00]  I don't think  it would matter  I think it  would  if Coke  Pepsi  like all  these trucks  and we say  50 businesses  did that  UPS  FedEx  even though  it would  hurt their  business  for a few  days  the city  would probably  stop  one brilliant  woman  in council  said  we don't  want any more  tractor trailers  in New York  City  so the  tractor trailers  will have to  stop outside  of the city  and then you'll  have to send  small trucks  and vans  to go meet  those trucks  and bring them  into the city 
[02:34:30]  so I'm like  okay so instead  of one tractor  trailer we're  going to have  you know  25 smaller  vehicles  all producing  the same amount  of exhaust  they have no idea  they get more  toll money  that way  more toll money  more parking  tickets  idiots in the end  hey do you guys  provide Amtrak  with their burgers  Amtrak no  okay  they're delicious  we took an  Xella recently  it could be the  worst food I've  ever had  oh the Xella 
[02:35:00]  to DC  I went from  Boston to Philly  same one  horrible  it's probably  the worst food  I've ever had  terrible  and then we  looked it up  online  what do they  say they  lose 85 million  dollars a year  on their food  impossible  how much  was that  tickets  in 10 years  in 10 years  they've lost  850 million  dollars  I think the DC  it was a  and it's not  because people  are not eating  it's because  this shitty food  costs so much  fucking money  to produce  and get  in your hands 
[02:35:30]  I don't see how  it's possible  that's all you  need to know  about government  right there  I know it  doesn't seem  possible  it was like  a $600 ticket  to get to DC  I mean don't  get me wrong  it's the best  way to travel  there  but they're  saying the  food operation  of the  Xella  loses 85  million dollars  a year  let me run  that  I'll turn it  around  no kidding  Denny what's  up  just gotta keep  on trucking  this is Dennis  Falcone  Chris Hardwick  he's an old  school radio  guy  oh nice  literally old  school  he doesn't  like moving  a hot mic  he doesn't 
[02:36:00]  like coming  into the studio  when the on-air  light is on  he wishes we  had a hot  clock in here  so we could  ramp up songs  properly  what else  guy's got all  this food in  the studio  it's a no-no  to eat on the  air right  usually is  yeah  and he's a  big fan of  the talking  dead  are you  yeah  sure  it was very  convincing  you saw that  what about  the talking  dead  what's that  I thought you  said the  grateful  dead  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  the grateful  dead  you know  Chris Hardwick  how are you  Chris 
[02:36:30]  he does this  show called  talking dead  which is on  after walking  dead  do you watch  the walking  dead  no  I like  it's just  reverse polarity  yeah yeah  it's great  do you watch  it  no  not familiar  I've heard good  things about it  though  but you're saying  good things  about it  because you  just assume  that's what  your audience  wants to hear  right now  there you go  it's all  about that  and that  wasn't even  really an answer  no  that was  just  that was  basically  let's do  that again  and it's  basically  just this  so say  that to  me 
[02:37:00]  which part  now  do you  actually  watch  the walking  dead  there  you just  said a  sentence  like  that's  all that  is  identifying  words  oh  are you  agreeing  with me  I'm  saying  what  you're  saying  sort  of  he's  one  of  those  radio  guys  that  doesn't  want  to  give  an  opinion  sure  that  might  piss  someone  off  right  right  I'm  a music  jock  you keep  it nice  and fucking  right down  the middle  of the road  keep it  right on  the line  between  the ditches  you want  a burger  sure  what kind  you want  you want  a smash  burger  this is a  good one  some of 
[02:37:30]  the vegetarians  in the audience  might be offended  by your choice  to eat a burger  they can do  whatever they want  the thing is  I don't like  pushing my  opinion on  somebody  it's like  boy I  watched that  show last  night  I thought  it was  horrible  I hate  what a  dish  jockey  says  I hate  this  song  I really  hate  that you're  trying to  push your  on the fence  point of view  on me  right now  that is true  you should  really have  it  I mean  you guys  slam a song  slam an artist  okay fine  so how would  you talk about  The Walking Dead  if you were  doing a radio  show right now  I would do  my show prep  about it  I would say  I've never  seen the show  well that would  piss people off 
[02:38:00]  no it wouldn't  I didn't say  bad things  sadly I've never  seen the show  but you've heard  good things  I've heard  good things  about it  oh you're  one of those  I've heard  good things  I've heard  good things  about it  that's right  alright  we should  take a break  I think  I know  I completely  frightened his  assistants out  two people  that bought us  burgers  yeah what was that about  Pat  with the girls  yeah  I don't know  now that I know  you're the star of me  man I'm going to  treat you differently  I know  I thought we were  just talking to a  schmuck  I mean imagine  those poor girls  that get up early  today  which is very nice 
[02:38:30]  beg chefs to get  out of bed early  cook us burgers  right  and I guess  that city shit  drives me nuts  I obsess about  the parking tickets  well they chase  this great business  out of the city  it's enraging  there's very little  manufacturing in Manhattan  anymore  as you can see  I did a quick video  we get off the air  at 10  there was a Coca-Cola  truck outside our  building  and I noticed  the parking ticket  so I asked him about it  he ran it  he couldn't wait  to show me  how many tickets  he got already  that morning  and he said  I've only been  delivering for about  an hour and a half  at this point  he had five or six 
[02:39:00]  I believe  and he says  I'll get at least  another five today  like what does  the city expect  where are you  supposed to park  your fucking truck  for each delivery  it would be impossible  to get your shit  out there  what do they say  to you  nothing  they're as nasty  as possible  they know  and I think  we refinance  you know  if they told us  okay you're refinancing  ground zero  from it  okay great  it's 12 years later  there's not even  a building up yet  what are you talking 
[02:39:30]  about  where's the money  going  you know  it's how they  spend it  where does that money  go  couldn't tell you  I don't think  they could tell you  it's just that  more frustrating  that they take  the money  and then  they spend it  you know  on anything  but good causes  right  that's amazing  alright we're gonna  take a break  should we get the  plugs in for the  burgers  Pat  we have  you got people  getting up early  today  so we should  at least get  the plugs in  we had  Breslin make us 
[02:40:00]  a beautiful  lamb burger  we had  Schnippers  we had  Bill's Rock  and we have  the new  amazing burger  from Citi Field  so whereas  in the old days  growing up  we all went  to baseball games  and had stale  pretzels  and dirty  water dogs  like they've  completely changed  food  in large format  places  you brought up  something  I just happened  to rip out  of the paper  today  guess how much  it costs  a family of four  to go to a  Yankee game  because you do  bring up  for just tickets  you bring up 
[02:40:30]  the old days  where you know  sure  I know where  you're going  you know  a family of four  so you got  a mom and a dad  and a couple kids  does this include food  it includes  I'll tell you  what it includes  a family of four  you get the  the four tickets  you get two beers  and two sodas  so everyone gets  one drink  for the entire  fucking game  four hot dogs  so that's it  for food and drink  parking  and then they  threw in two  programs and two  hats  I guess  $225  I'm going to guess  $375,000 
[02:41:00]  guy that ruins  the bit by guessing  too high  well you either  go a dollar  or you go super low  or super high  well the Mets  are close to what  you said Chris  Hardwick  who's going to be  at Caroline's  this weekend  I'm great at  plugging things  the Mets are at  $223 for a family  of four  I was $2 off  is that not bad  though  that doesn't sound  that bad  actually  it doesn't sound  that bad  they're in 11th  place for the  fucking league  for four people  to take your  fucking awful  family out  that's not bad  it's bad  what's wrong 
[02:41:30]  with you  that's not  how much could  the seats be  no it's horrible  because you're  going to eat  more than  a hot dog  each  and you're  going to want  more than  one drink  each  this is the  bare minimum  you're going to  spend  at what stadium  that's  City Fields  it's $223  fifth place  Giants  $237  Phillies  $257  Chicago  third place  $298  Yankees  $337  for a family  of four  for the  bare minimum  and they're  just behind 
[02:42:00]  the Red Sox  Red Sox  beat them  by $0.60  if anyone's  been to  City Field  lately  I can  understand that  because they  have completely  changed the  experience  it's no longer  just going to  sit and  watch a game  they have  all kinds  of things  and events  going on  during the  game  and tastes  of the nation  they have  different foods  from  I mean  where else  can  what other  stadium  can you get  fresh sushi  in  it's a  pretty amazing  experience  all that stuff  is going to  cost you  even more  though  yes  probably  I think 
[02:42:30]  the average  family of  four is  actually  hitting up  close to  $500  for a game  when it's  all said  and done  well they  should stop  eating  and drinking  because the  father has  nine beers  and he's  drunk  and he's  his family  and he needs  to bail  him out of  jail  and get  fuck him  fuck him  exactly  stay home  and watch  the game  dopes  alright Pat  thank you so  much  thank you guys  very good  it was enjoyable  are you going to  plug your reality  show that you're  supposedly doing  well our  our show  is Meat Men 
[02:43:00]  our company  is Pat Lafrida  Meat Purveyors  which is actually  I'm the third  generation so it's  my grandfather's  name  so you had no  choice you had  to go into  the meat business  no I was a  stockbroker for  a year  after college  yeah I fucking  hated it  I hated it  my first day  walking down  Wall Street  in a suit  I felt  high on life  and then  as soon as  I got behind  that phone  and I had  to like  make cold  calls  and self  intangibles  like stocks  I just couldn't  stand it  so I went 
[02:43:30]  to work  with my dad  I was going  to say  it didn't hurt  that you had  the family  business  to fall back  on  the family  business  was failing  was it really  we were tiny  we had  250 meat  companies  in the 14th  Street Meat  Market  drive through  there now  they're all  they're all  gone  they're close  I used to drive  through there a lot  but I never  actually know  there were meat  places  I just met  friends  so we've  we've grown it  into a very  successful huge  business  good for you  good man  alright  well the food  was tremendous  and despite the  listeners hating when we eat  on the air and not being 
[02:44:00]  excited for us  but the food was really  good  they gotta learn how to be  excited for us when we do  burger day I think  no they don't care  but I think they should be a  little excited for us  I'm gonna leave here  I'm gonna go catch up on my  talking dead  and then I'm gonna  go to sleep  oh that's interesting  I was gonna go watch  Meat Men  so it worked out okay  awesome  thank you for having me  guys  thanks Pat  you come back and see us  Chris Hardwick  you're staying right  I'll stick around  alright good  Chris is playing  Carolines this weekend  2-1-2  7-5-7 
[02:44:30]  4-100  Dennis if you wanna  hang out too  do have some work to do  because it's Friday  gotta get ready for the  big weekend  alright thanks Pat  but I like to roll  some of those shows  on a VHS  and watch them back  which ones  Talking Dead  Walking Dead  he's even got the  radio lean  I love it  you saw that right  yeah  so lean it  lean it into the mic  I love it  it's great  he worked at K-Rock  in LA  I did  he really  so he's a radio guy  K-R-O-Q  K-R-O-Q  was it Rodney  Rodney was there  Rodney Bingenheimer  yeah and they used to  and they used to tell us 
[02:45:00]  to do the opposite  of what traditional  radio would do  so like  going into a song  the program director  would always say  don't hit the post  that beat  like right before  the song comes in  where you're like  let's make K-R-O-Q  it's so sudden  and then the  we'd have to make it  sloppy on purpose  because the audience  they felt  very cool  but that's how  rock radio should be  that's why  in classic rock stations  they talk up records  you shouldn't do that  back in the day  in the 60s and 70s  the heart of 
[02:45:30]  album rock radio  they just said  here's a new one  from The Doors  here's the Stones  boom  start the record  that's it  because the artist  doesn't want you  babbling over  their music  they spend a lot  of time  getting those  intros together  I talk through  half the song  that's what I have  to say is important  I would hate  when a disc jockey  would come on  in the middle  of this song  and say  no more calls  we have a window  that's irritating  the girls have come back  thank you  you have presents  are you guys  freaked out by us  are you guys  creeped out by us  or Jim Norton  or anyone in this room  I'm a nice person 
[02:46:00]  you're alright  not intimidated at all  you're not intimidated  but creeped out  you guys want a knife  no you can take the knife  that's good  she's cleaning it  true murderous  very nice  you gotta eat my meat  aprons for you guys  thank you  eat my meat  aprons  oh this is cool  Chris doesn't want  oh this is sweet  but I don't  oh wow  this is nice  you know  I'll give this  you'll cherish it  I go to a lot of  adult movie theaters  thank you  this will be nice to wear 
[02:46:30]  sorry  what is your name  my name is Kate  Kate  what do you do for Pat  I'm the head of  special projects and events  which means what  I don't know  what does that mean Pat  everything  we have a lot of activities  he's not just a butcher anymore  are you based out of New Jersey  I am not  I'm based out of New York  okay  do you want my address  I certainly do  but not for any creepy reasons  I want to send you something  Jim just wants to show up  naked wearing an apron  Pat  I wore the thing you gave me 
[02:47:00]  eat my meat  talk into this one for a second  if we're going to chat with you  even if it's only for a second  because the listeners want to hear  I don't know if I have a radio voice  you do have a radio voice  now Kate  how long have you been working with Pat  I've been working for about  three and a half months  oh okay  what did you do before that  I worked for the New York City  Wine and Food Festival  okay  the Food Network  very incestual  very like  all in the food world  I was  were you at the  the roast of Anthony Bourdain  I was  that was brutal  did we meet that day 
[02:47:30]  we might have  okay I was on that roast  and I just got my gift package  by the way  so that's how unmemorable I am  but I've lost weight since then  no need to say it  that's what I was going to say  no I didn't  yeah that's what I looked good  but no  I just got the package  they sent some great shit  in that gift bag  what did they send you  you know Hank Gallo  yes  see fucking Hank  didn't send me my bag  he gave my first TV shot  is that the Gallo wine guy  it's not  although he probably  drinks more than they do  Hank is a fucking lush  I love him  gave him my first TV shot  really  in 90 that time  at Dice  and Hank Gallo  changed my life  but anyway 
[02:48:00]  there's some good swag in there  there really was  what did I love so much  oh these little  these little  iPad speakers  that I got  and a couple of other  food things I ate  there was a massage in there  there was an Uber car  not for me  there wasn't a massage  oh they probably knew better  wait what's an Uber car  what's an Uber car again  it's basically  it's an app right  where you can get a car instantly  Jonathan was just telling me  about Uber car  it's genius  I know one of the investors  one of the guys  who helped fund it  but basically  it accesses cars

[02:55:30]  and my show  is today  after we're doing it  because on Wednesday  Louis came in  and we don't want to  cut Louis short  so I'm doing my show  today from 10 to 11  my advice show  very very cool  so people stick around  after we're out of here  yeah I hope so  they will  they absolutely will  well you never know  you want to go back  to the wrestling thing too  the wrestling thing  two of our guys  are at Wrestlemania  or the pre-Wrestlemania  I don't know  press conference  or whatever the hell  fan fuck you  oh yeah  what are they calling it  Radio Row  you're our dream 
[02:56:00]  I'm not  you know I'm from Memphis  where a lot of  that wrestling was born  yes  and so I remember  seeing it basically  like public access  wrestling when I was a kid  I was never really into  I never watched sports  or wrestling or whatever  but since the podcast  I've gotten to know  a handful of wrestlers  and they're fucking  awesome guys  like super nerdy  super cool  they just happen to have  these Hulk bodies  right  that's absolutely the truth  Sam  yeah buddy  hey man  we got Chris Hardwick  in studio as well  oh that's great  I love Talking Dead 
[02:56:30]  is a much better after show  than my after show  I love that show  Sam does our after show  and he doesn't  and he doesn't have  5 million people  like you do  Chris Hardwick  had 5 million viewers  for the final episode  of Talking Dead  this year  that's incredible  Walking Dead  had 12.8 million  there's no  I mean there's only  a handful of things  that get that kind  of viewership anymore  it's great  audiences are so splintered  it's nuts  12.8  does anything come close  to that 
[02:57:00]  well on you know  some big network shows  do but  but most shows  I mean do you imagine  like in the 70s  like Carson  where it was like  25 million people  a night would watch  that show  because that's  everyone just had  a couple channels  that's it  unbelievable  much easier to be  a big  not easier but much  if you were on TV  you were a much bigger star  it was harder to get  on TV  because there was  less real estate  but if you did  you became a star  instantly  not so much these days  no  Sam 
[02:57:30]  yep  I just wanted to wrap up  because we started  with you guys today  how's E-Rock doing  E-Rock's doing  I mean he is  he is very excited  he's been able  first of all  he's after every interview  he's making sure  that to ask  if I want a picture  with whoever it is  right  because that way  he's like  oh yeah  and one more for me too  right right  he's you know  getting his photos in  and you know what's great  Dolph Ziggler  is listening to me  say this right now  so he's going to know  after we talk to him  that when E-Rock goes  yeah one for me too  he's going to know  exactly what the scheme is 
[02:58:00]  so he's got a nice  little scheme  has Dolph Ziggler  touched on Amy at all  I haven't talked to him yet  oh  is he right there  yeah he's right here  do you want to talk to him  no not really  yeah  no not really  no all right  forget it  all right  yeah I'm about to  yeah but we don't want to  all right  he's zero interest  all right  no interest whatsoever  okay  all right bye  hope that guy has a sense  of humor  yeah 
[02:58:30]  great if Sam's fucking  picking his teeth up  off the table right now  how great would that be  oh he just shattered  Sam's dumb jaw  Sam  yeah  yeah we weren't kidding  all right  so  back to you Chris  yes sir  we're talking about  podcasts  yes sir  talking about Walking Dead  what else is going on  in your world  we do the  Nerdist TV show  for BBC America  yeah when did that start  that started  well that started in  2011  we did a handful of  specials 
[02:59:00]  and then  and then now it's on  for you know  for 10 weeks  and it's sort of  an expanded version  of the podcast  but it's fun  I don't like having  guys like you in  because it just  makes me more frustrated  with this  with how awful  this place is  but how did you  turn the podcast  into a TV  what did you  you didn't wait  for somebody else to do  what did you do  that's our idea  we're like look  we do so much  visual stuff  we could easily  get a half hour  a week  an hour a week  yeah  and it doesn't  have to be  on some massive  over the top  network either  well I  for us  it was 
[02:59:30]  I'm a huge  Doctor Who fan  and so  that's how I  you mean  MFawesome  says the guy  who follows  chess matches  fair enough  I have things  that I like  which by the way  I support  I played tournament  chess  did you  that's right  we had this  great conversation  because I never knew  you were like  oh my god  and we started  talking about  Kasparov  and all these  matches  Magnus Carlsen  has agreed to  play me  do you play  regularly  I'm lying  I wanted to add  something 
[03:00:00]  I remember  when I shot  the comedy special  we went  the after party  was on this street  which I'd never  been on before  and we go  down the street  and there's all  these 24 hour  chess  the chess forum  one of them  just clubbed  I guess he gets  to the village  and it was like  on Thompson  or something like  that  one of those streets  yeah I was trying  to figure out  how do these  places stay open  you basically pay  five bucks an hour  or something  to sit down  and play  but what keeps  have they just been  open for so long  that do they own  the buildings  or what do you  think the deal is 
[03:00:30]  well one of them  closed  and I'm guessing  online chess  has hurt a lot  did you still go in there  no I never played  in those places  I would always play  at the cellar  with Keith  or those guys  but I'm guessing  it was just  it's a community thing  but now with  online chess  you can stay home  and play  and smoke indoors  I forgot that  you were a big  chess guy  growing up  you were really  good though  I was pretty good  but I can't play  anymore  because it's too  it hurts my head  now  do you play chess  with friends  no because I'm not  I can't do it 
[03:01:00]  recreationally  because so much  of my young life  I was trained  to like  you know  where you're basically  trying to fry the board  with laser eyes  oh really  you know  like it just  did your instructor  ever knock all the  pieces off  so you could see it  like in searching  for Bobby Fisher  no  and throw the rook  at your head  like the Rutgers coach  he'd call you a faggot  do you  do you remember  the old SNL sketch  with Jim Belushi  where he was like  the Bobby Knight  style chess coach  Knight to Rook 4  what are you doing  that's funny  so anyway 
[03:01:30]  so I pitched  the BBC show  I'm a huge Doctor Who fan  I got to know  the BBC folks  and they said  do you want to do a show  and I said yeah  I want to do  like a TV version  of the podcast  very cool  so it's more  it's not like  there aren't like  cameras in a studio  like a radio studio  it feels like a chat show  is there an audience there  yeah there's an audience  that's great though  how long is it  it's an hour  the show's an hour  on the BBC  so it's Saturday night  so it's Doctor Who  and then another show  called Orphan Black  that's a sci-fi show  and then our show  The Nerdist at 10  I got one 
[03:02:00]  just one chess question  so we all kind of  grew up playing chess  but what was it  that someone saw in you  where they're like  whoa you got  you got a talent here  and you should explore that  it was me  you just knew  well it was me  just loving the game  so much  and my school  I just happened  to be lucky enough  to have a school  that had  the head of the math  department  also was the computer lab  and he was also  the chess coach  and so  right in that room  and so he allowed 
[03:02:30]  he basically set the table  for us to  we'd play chess  before school  during lunch  and after school  and then in between  you'd screw around  on the computers  it was this bank  of Apple 2e computers  and you know  so that's where  a lot of it  that's where  a lot of it  they used to post  the ratings  on the wall  every day  they'd print out  the ratings  the USCF ratings  I belonged to  a secret chess club  and we were  a very secret society  but we would  greet each other  by seeing each other  and going  checkmate  why don't you 
[03:03:00]  tell Kate that  when she was in here  because that's all  I need is  damp panties  all over the studio  oh chess boy  do you think  she was interested  at all  she could  she literally  couldn't  if I picked a scab  and held it up  to her  she couldn't  have been  less interested  to me  nothing to do  with me  you know  if you had met  under different  circumstances  yes like  me with a ski mask  and a gun  and her  tied up somewhere  it's gotta be  really  intimidating  to come into  a room 
[03:03:30]  of dudes  where everyone's  talking real fast  and there's a lot  of testosterone  excellent way to put it  that's why I like  Chris  because what you  should have said  is it must be  really uncomfortable  to come in  where guys are  talking and the  one with gray hair  and the misshapen  head hits on you  that's a really  nice way to  fucking phrase that  thank you my friend  of course  I do enjoy chess  though I love  love love  fucking chess  players  like great  chess players  like uh  you know  I want to meet  these  because they're 
[03:04:00]  playing I think  Magnus Carlsen  is playing  Viswanathan Anand  like I really  am interested in how  that turns out  for the championship  and uh  I'm just dying  to be at that  match  god you  I'm telling you  man  you should do  some type of  thing with it  yeah but I'm not  a good enough  player  like I literally  am a very  average player  but because I'm  average at it  like I  respect what  I'm fascinated  by those guys  like I would love  to talk to any  of them for a  great length  and it would  probably bore the  audience  so just ask 
[03:04:30]  stupid questions  I wonder if  a lot of  them would  really be  good in  conversation  no they're  probably good  when talking  to chess  people who  can talk  about well  explain your  opening there  well for me  I would just  go so did  you know  when the horse  jumped the  night  were you happy  that's the same  piece  asshole  oh sorry  but you know  that you know  the game  I'd rather just  talk about  Bobby Fisher  yeah  yeah  so did you  agree with  what he said  about Jews  go  I don't know 
[03:05:00]  why do you  ask me these  things  yeah  then they're  winking  yes  yes  any Americans  good at chess  besides him  yeah there's  some I'm sure  I mean  there are  not many  though is my  point right  they're Russian  Russian because  it's a culture  of chess there  and Carlson  is from like  Scandinavia or  Sweden or  something  or Norway  he's from some  Nordic fucking  country  America  like other  countries will  take kids  where they  notice an  aptitude for  something  and make  them you know  like they  will exploit 
[03:05:30]  those in  terms of  musicianship  or sport  you know  or like  ballet  or something  or chess  and in  America  it's basically  like pageants  you know  like that  pageants  are what  America  it's sort of  what they do  with their  it's kind of sad  yeah  we have the  first black  grandmaster  I believe  is American  look him up  I don't know  his name  but he  say any  name  right now  I think  did you  see Brooklyn  Castle  that documentary  last year  I did not  no but I  remember that 
[03:06:00]  yeah  it's very good  it's about  a group of  kids from a  Brooklyn chess  team  right right  right  I wanted to  get them in  to interview  them actually  who is  who is  Maurice Ashley  Maurice Ashley  yes  the first black  GM  you know  something about  chess  no I just  like good  documentaries  I love a good  documentary  Brooklyn Castle  speaking of which  Vice is on tonight  let's not forget  give those guys  a book  Vice is on tonight  Shane Smith's show  love those guys  from HBO  Vice on HBO  it's gonna be good  yeah I haven't seen it yet  but I know the show  it's gonna be fun 
[03:06:30]  it's tremendous  it's gonna be good  he saw the first  two episodes  first two and they  showed part of the  Korea episode  which was oddly moving  like it wasn't all  about Rodman  cause there was a couple  of the Globetrotters  there and they were  showing some of the game  but then they're  showing the Globetrotters  interact with these kids  these North Korean  children  and it was really  amazing to watch  these kids  being  just  spinning the basketball  on their finger  the Globetrotters  they'd never seen  anything like that  like American kids  see that shit on TV  all the time  they'd never seen it 
[03:07:00]  and to watch them  reacting to it  was really moving  it was great  wow  these guys are  fucking tremendous  they were all there  too at the premiere  Shane was there  fucking Saru  all of them  the whole fucking  and the one guy  was telling us  about getting drunk  with Kim Jong-un  it was very interesting  and then Shane's  teasing that one line  was it in Afghanistan  the borderline  oh no Pakistan India  Pakistan India  the border  in Kashmir  he went right up to the line  he was kind of  fooling around  with it a little bit  it was great  and basically  if you go over the line  they will shoot you  they said that  if you walk into Pakistan  if you take one step  over the line in Pakistan 
[03:07:30]  they'll shoot you  and they mean it  they're not  Shane just went right  up to the line  and just kind of  tiptoed around  a little bit  this is not a Cuba  fucking US Guantanamo  thing where they're  not actually going to  shoot you  if you took one foot  over  you know  I mean if you ran in  they might  but if you put one foot  over the line in Cuba  they're not going to  shoot an American  but in fucking  in Pakistan India  you put one foot  over the line  they'll shoot you  dead  I know I'm saying  that like an authority  figure  I'm repeating what I  heard but with fervor  and they're never  going to figure that  one out  no they hate each other 
[03:08:00]  they're not going to  figure that one out  oh you know  what do I know  I just want to know  the Carlson Anand  Anand match  it's all I care about  you looked it up  when is it  if I can get tickets  tell Roland to book them  thanks  so Chris  when are you sleeping  if you got all these  projects  I don't sleep very often  I sleep on planes  do you really  I can't sleep on planes  at all  I don't have a problem  sleeping on planes  I even fall asleep  while you're getting  blown  that's happened to me  a few times  Jesus  really  for real  getting blown  is that where  yes 
[03:08:30]  oh a mouth bath  yeah  are you kidding though  no I've been very tired  I've been very tired  you know Jim  you're fascinating to me  because I think you should  do a political show  or something  you know  the girls come in  and you sort of make  like I'm going to  put a ski mask on  and you make these  but you have so much  insight into things  I really think you should  do some kind of  political something  or I don't know  thank you  nobody agrees with you  I agree with you  but nobody agrees with you 
[03:09:00]  you're a fucking smart guy  you should really  you could fucking  take over  Weez says he likes  talking politics with you  one of my  uber liberal friends  Weez is a real liberal  he's not a fake  language police liberal  he is all in liberal  yeah but he's a  he's a guy  he's a liberal  who just  did time in Vietnam  served two tours  and fucking hates  the government  and doesn't trust him  like that to me  is what a fucking  you know  he's a denim jacket  wearing liberal  he's not like  one of these guys  who wants you fired  if you don't hyphenate  properly  but he always likes  talking politics with you  well you know 
[03:09:30]  you give him a good run  and I'm  well I'm reasonable  I don't disagree  you give him a good run  so  well you know  are you on the road a lot  oh god is he  I am but not as  I just shot an hour  so like I'm back now  for a while  I got a few dates  I actually got Caroline's  next week  yeah  and then I  stress factored  a few things local  you know Baltimore  and then just  I'm done with the act  for a while  it's like you want  to just start over  sure sure yeah  that's where I am  because my special  aired in November  so now I'm building  the new  which is the best  it's fun  it's a fun  I never  the weird thing 
[03:10:00]  about this is  I shot the special  normally once the special  is shot  I have no more  fucking road work  and it's goodbye material  and right to the comedy  seller  but now I still have  I'm gonna probably work  up until July  once the special airs  I will not be doing  the material anymore  you can't  I found what's interesting  is that when I did  the first  when I did the special  last year  it basically was born  out of a bunch  of shorter sets  that were stitched  together  but now that I'm  forming the set  on the road  in as  that when I go  when I've gone 
[03:10:30]  and like try to do  guest sets  10 minute guest sets  I fucking struggle  because I'm like  oh god I don't know  this one bit  needs this other bit  next to it  to contextualize it  and it's sort of  hard to  because I'm not  just like joke joke joke  joke joke joke  so it's been sort of  weird but it's great  like to do the hour  is great  but it is hard  when you walk  into a place  they want you to  alright we'll do  a couple minutes  and it's like  alright well my  opening joke  I can't do that  because I fucking  say continent  my next joke  is racial  I can't do that  like they think  that they just  do a couple of  minutes  it doesn't work  that way  because you have 
[03:11:00]  to you sort of  have to let the  audience get to  know you a little  bit before you  before you go  deeper  so that they're  like okay  they're already  on board  they know you're  not threatening  they know that  you know  so it's sort of  some guy in LA  was like oh I'm  starting up the show  do you want to  come do 7 minutes  and I felt like a dick  I was like I don't  know if I know  how to do 7 minutes  like 8 jokes  for a 7 minute set  I did live at  Gotham last night  and Chris didn't  care I was really  the owner of Gotham  he was doing  older stuff whatever  because I couldn't  do anything I had  just shot  because if I aired  something live on 
[03:11:30]  TV before and  out of my special  they would have  fucking decapitated me  so I'm going  through a lot of  material which was  fun to do because  I haven't done  some of it in a while  and some of it  I've never done on  TV and there was  one new bit that's  just not going to  stay in the special  that I did and  it was weird to have  to time it because  you know it's live  television so the  guys wrap up  wrap it up and he's  like you better  fucking finish  quickly at one  point I just look  at the crowd I'm  like ah look at  these girls all  right be right back  did you really  yeah because I knew  like I would rather  just go out like  just saying something  silly than in the 
[03:12:00]  middle of a joke  and when you fuck  you can't fuck  with the advertisers  right you know  you just can't  yeah we don't fuck  with the advertisers  ever I think that's  the beauty of not  having any there's  nothing to lose we  risk losing no one  we can't offend our  advertisers well we're  going to break and  then Jim Norton's  going to continue  with his advice show  I am yes at 10  o'clock and  then on the dot  yeah  I'm a fan of hers  and we ended up  she was supposed to  do a show in Phoenix  that's Amy and  that's Dolph talking  about Amy  yeah yeah he sounds  like a good guy  Chris Hardwick thank 
[03:12:30]  you so much  that just sounded  like a pocket dial  that you just  talked about  is it intimidating to be  around somebody who's  that funny when you're  like dating a girl  who's that funny  it's really challenging  yeah  oh talk about Amy  yeah  should we keep it  going  usually I'm the killer  yeah  and I'm like  she's funnier than me  this is  oh yeah  alright let's see  and it makes me think  and it challenges me  I loved it  it was so fun  because like when  she's in  alright  Chris Hardwick  is at Caroline's  this weekend  212-757-4100  of course  it's Nerdist 
[03:13:00]  on Twitter  it's the Nerdist  podcast  it's Nerdist.com  it's the BBC show  it's unbelievable  yep  because Chris  is a fucking doer  I respect that  honestly  I mean  I really mean that  it's fucking good  you do shit  and that's  I respect that  I think it was  before the majority  of my career  I wasn't doing anything  and then you get  to a certain point  where you're like  if I don't start  doing stuff now  it's not gonna happen  and no one  just comes in  and goes  here have this thing  no they don't  we all wait  for that magic day 
[03:13:30]  where someday  I'll wake up  and the call will come  Jim  everything's in line  you just have to show up  the network's all called  they get it  it's never gonna happen  you just have to show up  they knew you were sleeping in  that will never happen  and the podcast  is always in the top 10  if not even  I mean it's  it's like one  and one or two  on a lot of weeks  too there  yeah we've been  pretty fortunate about it  it's just fun  I just like doing  the stuff that I do  I think that's the best  thing  if you like what you're doing  it's all 
[03:14:00]  everything's gravy  do you do it by yourself  like Bill Burr  or do you have guests  well I have  there are two co-hosts  who are on a lot of the episodes  but not all of them  because a lot of them  I travel  or they're working  or whatever  on other stuff  but we have guests  and then we have episodes  where it's just the three hosts  oh cool  that we call hostful episodes  and those usually go up  about once a week  good for you man  and we just did a stand-up special too  we did a stand-up special  at our space at Meltdown  where's Meltdown?  Meltdown's a comic book store  in LA  and we have a little theater space  at the back  so we do shows  seven nights a week 
[03:14:30]  and so we did  I did a stand-up  we do a stand-up special  once a year  so we're putting that up  soon  oh that's great man  yeah  see we need a spot like that  somewhere in New York City  we need  just our little joint  you need a live spot  to do  we have nothing  we talk about a lot of stuff  all of us  we have nothing  but we don't do it  dude seriously  I'm telling you  having a little clubhouse  was so great for us  and ours is in a comic book store  and it's a really great environment  and the store is huge  and it's kind of a legendary store  and a lot of our podcasts  we have a space upstairs  and a lot of our podcasts  record there  it's really  it's fun  so yeah  you guys should just have a live space 
[03:15:00]  where people can come hang out  you go do live shows  and interact with your crowd  here's what we do  we complain on the air  and complain to each other  and we mean it  we're genuinely being honest  with each other  and then we just go our separate ways  and all do nothing about it  but we're also under contract  and these guys just don't feel like  listening to  I've had  I've got to defend us a little bit  I've had a shit load of meetings  with Scott Greenstein  on a lot of this stuff  and it's a lot of  yeah yeah yeah yeah  and nothing ever fucking  comes in  but we don't make it happen  and I say we  because I'm as late  believe me  I am emotionally at times  very bad with this shit 
[03:15:30]  I know what I have to do  and I don't do it  what's very hard  and what I don't understand  how you do  is doing a morning radio show  is so emotionally taxing  and exhausting  I don't know how you do  get up super early in the morning  and then still go perform at night  because I find that  in both fields  you level off at mediocrity  it removes all pressure  I can wake up tired  and be blah  I can go on stage tired  and it's blah  that's all it is  it's a constant mediocre  I have a final question  because you just brought up something  why is doing morning radio  so taxing 
[03:16:00]  you did  you've been in this radio game  a while now  I did  we only work four or five hours  you do  technically  but is it mentally  just exhausting  well for me  I remember  you know  I remember getting up  at like three o'clock  in the morning  I'd get beat at work  by 4.30  you'd have to do show prep  so you know  we were on the air  at I don't know  5.30 maybe  or six or something  and then  you definitely  you do the four hour show  but you're constantly  mentally engaged  the whole time  because you're looking  at the clock  how long  okay we got this  we're talking to that guy  we're moving on this break  go to this song  then after that 
[03:16:30]  there's the post show  then you kind of got a plan  and then throughout the day  you're like  oh what are we going to do  for the show tomorrow  then  so it's really  it's really like a 12 hour job  and your day ends  at like 3 in the afternoon  and then you're exhausted  and then you have time  to do other stuff  and then that  I bailed on it  being a 12 hour day job  it's not even a 4 hour day job  for us  it was for many years  but I finally had to like  say no man  mentally it's killing me  and people work  way the fuck harder than us  but I go home exhausted 
[03:17:00]  a lot of days  I would challenge  I mean yes  it's not  you know  this stuff  it's not like  you know  construction  or building a railroad  or like  it's not  work with your hands  but you know  you challenge someone  to be super focused  and mentally engaged  for like 5 hours straight  and they're going to be tired  your brain gets fucking tired  right  in the real world  you're lucky to get someone  to pay attention to you  for 15 seconds  I mean you have to have  that ridiculous focus  for 4 or 5 hours a day  yeah  where you really are  paying attention to everything  for 5 hours 
[03:17:30]  or else  yeah it goes off the rails  right on  well Chris it's always a pleasure  Chris Hardwick  good to see you  and don't forget to see him  at Caroline's this weekend  stay tuned  Jim Norton continues  Jim Norton  is a moderately successful comedian  an average author  and a terrible actor  and you're a chance to speak  directly with him  call 866-969-1969  Hairy pussies 
[03:18:00]  have never been  a thing of attraction  for me  and  I always liked them shaved  but I found myself  and I brought it up  earlier in the week  really enjoy  I guess because I like  the big vaginas  but I found myself  looking at this hairy website  because this one girl  Bianca Stone  who I've talked about  she's a porn girl  had this amazing 
[03:18:30]  massive vagina  which was sexy  but she's like really hairy  that's what her thing is  she's a hair model  and hair  I never liked it  but because it was on this vagina  that I think is so sexy  I can't stop watching her movies  and I'm like  I'm 44 years old  and my ex-girlfriend  was teasing me  because she's like  you made me laser everything  and I'm like  yeah but you don't understand  it's not like I want to date a girl  with a big hairy pussy  I don't think I could do that  but just on this one girl  it's super super sexy to me  and I'm like  am I getting a new fetish 
[03:19:00]  at this age  like you think  you know yourself  and you know yourself sexually  and I've recently been interested  and I've been looking at feet  a little bit  just like in videos  like oh she has nice feet  I wonder what they smell like  like is that just me  being so jaded  that I'm just moving on  to the next drug  like if I was still drinking  would this be the equivalent  of going from beer to vodka  probably it's something new  it's something new  but I don't want it  it's not what I want to  I'm not a foot fetish guy  I saw she tweeted you back 
[03:19:30]  oh yeah yeah she did  she was actually really nice  and she emailed me  because she heard the segment  but it was friendly  and I told her  look we had a good time with it  and you know  she said she was very appreciative  of us speaking highly  you know  they're always nice  those girls  highly sure  I did  and those girls  are always very very nice  so you know  if you want to check out  her Twitter or whatever  if you're into that  if you're not then don't  but if you are  she's the go to gal  now Mick in Illinois  has a silly question  Mick  hey Jimmy  hello  I'm like I would 
[03:20:00]  you know a year and a half  away from being 40  and I still get hard on  I mean I still wake up  in the morning  and he's up before I am  but my question about Viagra  is does it make it harder  or does it just help you  last longer  because obviously  we all remember  when we were kids  you could cut stone  with how hard it was  and when you get older  it's like  eh  I'll just kind of hang around  here a little bit  you know  right  so it's not like  it used to be  you know  it's not that throbbing  yeah  turgid  delicious gift  yes  Florentine would always say 
[03:20:30]  I got a soggy six going  so that's  does Viagra make your dick harder  yes it does  it makes your erections harder  Cialis, Levitra  all the same thing  it makes them harder  it makes your  them last longer  and it's a little harder  to come on them  but it's well worth it  because the great thing about  I think some of it  is a very very physical reaction  obviously  but part of it  a little part of it  is psychological  because you just have confidence  that your cock  is going to work  so you know  you just react  like if a girl 
[03:21:00]  just touches you  all of a sudden  your dick is  poking obscenely  through your satin underpants  or whatever else is  I wear  in public  my satin sweatpants  my white satin sweatpants  but yeah  it makes your dick harder  but it also relaxes you more  so if your doctor says  take it  take it  if not  just bootleg it  like I do  from Canada  thank you my friend  okay  thank you  I just didn't know  if it helped it last longer  or if it was  yeah  it takes a while  it does make it last longer  yes  thanks Jimmy  okay  Manny in Oakland  I definitely can help this guy 
[03:21:30]  hi Manny  hey what's up  you know  hi buddy  I got one question  when are you coming back  to the Bay Area  I do not know  I want to book San Francisco  but sooner or later  I'll get out there  okay  I got a question  my wife has been getting  extremely overweight  and she's extremely sensitive  about anything  I talk to her  when it comes to  about her  sure  so  so she basically  she's a fucking  she's become a fat woman  who is very sensitive 
[03:22:00]  about you mentioning  that she's becoming  a fat woman  yeah  I mean  she kind of disgusts me  when I  when we go eat  oh cause she's eating poorly  are you there  oh we got cut off  this fucking fat wife  probably  maybe she  maybe she fucking  she probably fell against the  the side of the house  knock the wall out  good improv  Jim  and his question was  how do I tell her  she's getting fat  moo around her  a lot  whenever she walks in 
[03:22:30]  make cow or pig noises  I don't know  that's a tough one  cause you love her  she's your wife  you don't want to hurt her  you might have to have  an honest discussion  with her  and say  it's bothering me  that you're putting  the weight on  go from the health angle  don't say look  whenever I look at you  naked now  you know  it makes me think  of a fucking diaper  filled with vomit  that's what  that's what your body  does to my dick  picture a vomit  filled diaper  that's what you do  to me  you don't want to  phrase it like that  line one sort of  has the same issue  line one is 
[03:23:00]  I'm obsessed with  oh here it is  lost a bunch of weight  how do I convince my wife  to lose weight too  oh okay  let's go to this guy  cause maybe I can help  destroy two marriages  at once  hey Jimmy  the thing is  is like  I lost 120 pounds  I'm still 240  I'm not perfect  but I'm working  sure  but my wife  at first  she was kind of  doing it  a little bit  and then she just  won't now  like I run every day  and I do push ups 
[03:23:30]  and sit ups  cause I can't afford  a gym membership  and I work long hours  okay  so I run like  five miles a day  I do push ups  and sit ups  throughout the day  at work  cool you're  taking care of yourself  good  yeah and I'm trying  I try to eat better  I still fuck up  a little bit  cause it's  you know  it's hard  you know  you're doing so good  I fuck up too though  I had burger this morning  I mean we all  we all have those  little fucking slips  the key is  once you have one  to not write it off  and go  cause right now  I'm looking at my stomach  going I feel fat  I look gross  but it's like  just shut up  you fucking 
[03:24:00]  cum sniffer  just fucking go to the gym  and shut up  that's what I gotta tell myself  when you look in the mirror  is it hard to see  that you've lost weight  no  like I still see my old self  in the mirror  like I've lost 120 pounds  I still look like a fucking  bubbling disgusting mess  and so it's hard for  like I'll tell my wife  like I've lost this weight  you know  all you gotta do is run baby  all you gotta do is run  I'm trying  I'm trying  she won't do nothing  because like I work  I work 16 hours a day  she works 8  she's like Ginny Sack 
[03:24:30]  just fucking  you know  she's binging on fucking  food in the basement  while you're out  at work  I know what you're saying  and I also understand  seeing that same picture  in the mirror  I do acknowledge  I've lost a lot of weight  though like  I'll look in the mirror  and I see a difference  but then there's days  like today  where I feel like  I'm having a fat day  cause I  you know  if you eat bad  one or two days  you're like  oh god I'm right  because there's that  sick part of me  that wants to be unhappy  and it really is a part  it's that sick part of me  that wants to fail  or that wants to be miserable 
[03:25:00]  or that sees myself  as worthless or ugly  and I don't mean  the humorous part  like where I talk about it  and make fun of it  or air it in public  but there's that real part  so  the key is to  how to not listen  to that part all the time  cause there's times  where that part is right  hey dummy  you look like shit  do something  but then there's  times where I'm doing good  and I eat bad one day  and my mind goes  you look like shit again  just fuck it  you know  and I have to recognize  the difference  between those voices  one is my mind going  hey stop doing  what you're doing  it's bad  and the other one  is a sick part of me  trying to make me feel bad 
[03:25:30]  so I fuck up more  so don't listen to that part  it's hard  you nailed it with fat day  because like some days  I can almost see  a fucking ab starting  yeah  and then like  the next day  it's like it fucking  hangs down  it's like what the fuck  yesterday I thought  I saw a goddamn ab  I did sit up  till I fucking cried  I did push ups  till my fucking shoulders  were about to break  and I can't even see  a fucking  I can't make a muscle  in the mirror  and then the next day  it's like oh look  there's I almost got 
[03:26:00]  an OPV  well the key is to  occasionally realize  that you know  the good things  you're seeing  are probably more realistic  than the bad ones  because the bad ones  are from old  old old habits  and old old  and thank you for your call buddy  I appreciate that very much  it's hard to get somebody  a comedian named  Colin Jost  who's a writer  for Saturday Night Live  he was on that  Gotham show  I did last night  and he was one of the guys  who was  he was very funny  and he did a funny bit  about if you're in a 
[03:26:30]  you better both  lose weight together  because if one of you  loses weight  and the other one doesn't  and he goes through  this funny thing  about when people  see you guys together  and basically  it's one person  gets the compliment  and the other doesn't  but he did it  obviously in a funny joke  but it's kind of hard  to convince somebody  because you don't want  to offend somebody you love  and you don't want  to go through  a month of arguing  but when they're like  I'm trying  I'm trying  and they're still eating  fucking french onion soup  and eating a donut  that's look  and I understand  a fucking addiction  because I'm a psycho  and I'm not saying 
[03:27:00]  to fat people  fuck you  I know it's really  fucking hard  and I mean that  you have the hardest one  sex and this food  is even harder than sex  because you have to eat  but don't convince yourself  that you're trying hard  when you're eating bread  and eating shit  all the time  convince yourself of that baby  but don't let me hear it  because you think  I didn't want to eat  two of those fucking burgers  today  I wanted to shove  eight of those sliders  into my fucking  cunty face 
[03:27:30]  and I couldn't  once in a while  you have to say  no  so  good luck  my friends  and  who's the guy  that needs  Josh from Boston  needs a book recommendation  on what  hold on  before we go to him  are we already on him  sorry Josh  there's one I really  want to address  I just saw this  Brian let me talk  to Brian  in Boston  sorry Josh  just hold tight  hi Brian  how are you  good buddy  how you doing  good good  it sounds like  an honest topic  so thank you for calling  what's your question  I'm just kind of curious 
[03:28:00]  like these free  porn sites  that you go to  like the ex-hamster  or red tube  and stuff  when you look at the teens  or when I look at the teens  are they all legal  oh yeah  an ex-hamster  no sure  those girls are probably  18 to 23  they just look younger  but your thing says  you know  I'm worried  the teen porn  I'm watching  is kiddie porn  now are you worried  that  never  I didn't say that  oh that's what it says  on this thing  well I just want to make sure  that it's legal  oh okay 
[03:28:30]  are you worried  about it being underage  I think that they're all  pretty legal  because they all have to  sign off in this day and age  you're not looking for them  to be younger are you  no god no  oh okay  I think they are all legal  yeah  I mean I never ever worry  on one of those main sites  especially after the  Tracy Lord scandal  years ago  where the queen of porn  had to just drop out  I don't think that  I think that they are  very very careful  in porn about that  like you know  when you look at pornography  and the amount of shit 
[03:29:00]  and none of the  even the fucking libertarians  are phony  when it comes to  sticking up for people  no one defends people  in porn  all they do  is attack porn  and as a group  they fuck for a living  and look at the few  and I mean  minuscule amount  of AIDS problems  they've had  like a whole thing  considering the amount  of people that do  that shit for a living  or the very few  underage  fucking problems  that they've had  like they are  extraordinarily careful  in porn  so I think you're safe 
[03:29:30]  on X Hamster  or any of those  major sites  X Tube  I think that they have  to have proper  documentation  and proper paper  because nobody wants  to go to jail  for that shit  they sent Max Hardcore  whose real name  is Paul Little  to jail  and by the way  where were all you  fucking phony  civil libertarians  where were you  when this guy  went to jail  for four years  for obscenity  and they were all  he was doing like  that they were all  little girls  and he was fucking  but they were all  adults  and you could show  little girls  being killed  in a movie  so what he did 
[03:30:00]  was  and thank you  very much  for the call  I appreciate it  buddy  take care  we love you  thank you very much  I'm sorry to cut you off  but yeah  what he did  was tasteless  and you know  they have him  ship it to Tampa  that was some  like you know  technically illegal  thing  but what he did  might have been  tasteless  but it was  perfectly legal  and they were all  18 years old  and consenting adults  where the fuck  where was Hollywood  where were all you  phony cocksuckers  in Hollywood  when this guy  was being sent  to prison  for obscenity  for doing something 
[03:30:30]  with consenting adults  imagine if that was  a regular actor  and excuse me  for going off  on a tangent here  but imagine if that  was a regular  filmmaker  going to jail  these fucking  Hollywood  fucking phonies  can't defend  Roman Polanski  fast enough  and he really  did fuck  a 13 year old  they cannot  fly out  of the country  fast enough  to work with  Roman Polanski  because he is  a brilliant  film director  they cannot  work with this  guy fast enough  and he really  fucked a child  in the ass  in a hot tub 
[03:31:00]  but Max Hardcore  only making  only making it  seem like he was  fucking young girls  all fucking  legal girls  not one of these  phony cocksuckers  came to his defense  so I think  you're safe  but I think  porn people  should get a lot  more credit  for behaving  responsibly  than they  do  they get  they really  get very  every time  something goes  wrong in porn  they're like  oh look at this  industry  it's killing  everybody  fucking annoys me  so all you  politicians out there  even you libertarians  are fucking phony 
[03:31:30]  when it comes to  this stuff  so let's go to  the Josh  sorry Josh  the book recommendation  what are you asking  yeah I've gotten  a few good book  recommendations  from you  I've read the  Damien Echols  I've read the  Chris Kyle book  which was awesome  but I'm at a  I don't know  what else to read  I remember you guys  had Mike Baker on  the CIA agent  did he ever write a book  I don't know  I didn't read his book  but I can tell you  a great biography  honestly 
[03:32:00]  and I'm not just  horror  Ozzy Osbourne's  autobiography  was tremendous  even if you're not  an Ozzy fan  it's hilarious  and it's an amazing  rock biography  Peter Chris's  biography  was fucking  great  from Kiss  so one of those  two books  honestly both  tremendous books  alright buddy  Jimmy  yes sir  I had a blast  over in Somerville  I was at the  second show  my wife is the  one that took  me for my  birthday  and I had a 
[03:32:30]  blast  the only issue  I had was  I shook  Kenny's hand  and he just  about ripped  my arm out  of a socket  with a straight face  he can't help it  you've seen the  monsters  he runs through  the fucking  door every week  thank you very  much for the call  he means well  Darren in  North Carolina  yes sir  Jimmy  hi Darren  I'm actually  standing up  like Eric Bogosian  in talk radio  because I want  to see him  what a real  talk radio  guy is like  sorry buddy  guys  hello man  I'll just start  with  I've been a  functional alcoholic 
[03:33:00]  for about  almost 30 years  man  wow  that wasn't  bad enough  about a year  ago I had  surgery on my  lower back  and I guess  you know where  this is going  yeah  now I'm a  full-blown  opiate addict  and I  I mean  I'd rather have  that than  alcohol now  and I've tried  stopping so many  times and  with the  withdrawal symptoms  and just the fact  I've made it a  week one time  that's all I can  make it  and then just 
[03:33:30]  the mental  addictiveness  of it  kicks in  the depression  everything  but basically  I guess my  question  if I could  just get  through the  withdrawals  I mean  I think  I could  kick it  but do you  have any  any  well I would  say this  first of all  I think  functional  alcoholics  have a  harder time  because you  guys can  drink a  lot longer  and convince  yourself  that there's  nothing wrong  I was  extraordinarily  dysfunctional  in my  like I only  drank for a  few years  but had I  been more  functional  I very 
[03:34:00]  well may  have drank  until I  was 30  years old  if I  made it  so I  don't envy  guys that  are functional  or periodic  alcoholics  I would  suggest if  you have  insurance  getting to  a rehab  you know  if you  don't have  insurance  go to a  detox of  some sort  and then  maybe find  a 12 step  program  but you  know you  need to  stop  and life  there's a  great life  it's not  it's not  who you  are  it seems  like it's  such a big  part of your  life that's  who you  are and  you're giving  up this  gigantic piece  of your  identity  and your 
[03:34:30]  being  and your  existence  but you're  really not  you're giving  up a fucking  as they say  a monkey  on your back  you're getting  a weight  off of you  you're not  losing anything  you're getting  something terrible  out of you  it's like getting  a cancer cut  out of you  so I would  suggest a  rehab  okay  yeah  yeah  it's like  I can't  even  it's hard  to even  get out  of bed  without  you know  taking my  meds  man  I can't  even  function  during the  day  it's obsessive  and I just  feel like I  can't even  live without  it now  and that's  just what  it does  to your  brain  but  you can't 
[03:35:00]  live without  it  because a lot  of us  are  the key  is to get  into a  rehab  and it's  not the  easiest  thing  but it  really is  it gets  easier and  easier  and it's  worth it  your whole  life will  be so much  fucking  better man  you're not  losing  anything  by giving  it up  you're losing  nothing  somebody  described it  to me  many many  years ago  he said  picture  and it  sounds  maybe corny  now  but he  said  picture  life  is like  a buffet  and  everything  is on  that  table  and if  you pick  up  alcohol  on that 
[03:35:30]  table  is available  to you  but if  you give  them two  up  then you  can have  anything else  on the table  that you  want  and I  heard that  in probably  1988  and I never  forgot it  because yeah  there's people  who succeed  when they're  drunk or  whatever  or they're  doing drugs  but life  just opens  up to you  when you're  not doing  that  and it's  not always  perfect  but believe  me  it's so  much better  than you can  imagine  it is  without it  dude  I've struggled  for months  now  to not  graduate  to heroin  I just  can't let  myself do it  that's why I've  got to stop  this bullshit 
[03:36:00]  sooner or  later  but I  appreciate it  Jim  alright buddy  get into a  rehab  and the  worst that  can happen  is after  30 days  you save  up and  you have  money  for a  great  party  so I  would  suggest  doing  that  okay  bye bye  buddy  okay  let's talk  to Rich  in Rhode  Island  hi Jim  thanks for  taking my  call  hi Rich  myself and  two of my  friends  we're all  around 25  years old  and we've  graduated  from college  been great  friends with  one of them  since kindergarten 
[03:36:30]  and the other  since freshman  year high  school  two of us  now are  in graduate  school and  the other  has been  working a  job for  allegedly a  year and a  half and  said he's  moved into  an apartment  within the  past few  months  recently we  learned through  his sister  that the  friend with  the job  has been  compulsively  lying to  us for  the past  year and  a half  turns out  he's never  held a  job at  the place  he's claimed  no one  there has  ever heard  of him  it turns out  he doesn't  rent an  apartment  as it's  a condo  that was  just sold  last month  he's getting 
[03:37:00]  kicked out of  his house  at the end  of May  and he's  even been  lying to  his girlfriend  regarding his  apartment and  living situation  me and my  friend we feel  slighted because  we've been such  good friends for  such a long  time but we  want to know  how to approach  him without  him resenting  us for  prying into  his business  but that's  amazing to me  I understand  exactly what  you're saying  there are  compulsions  first of all  I wouldn't  take it  personally  he's not  doing it  to you  he's just  doing it  compulsive  liars are  enraging  but there's  also it's 
[03:37:30]  a sickness  because imagine  just having to  lie about  everything  sometimes you  lie if you  cheat on a  girl you  lie if you  steal something  you lie but  I get why  you're lying  there but  these compulsive  motherfuckers that  lie about  everything I  hate them and  in another way I  feel for them but  that is how crazy  we are as their  friends this  cocksucker's been  lying to you for  a year and a  half and you're  like how do I  tell him the  truth about his  full of shitness  without offending  him fuck him  you know you  could tell him  nicely you and  your friend can  go look we're 
[03:38:00]  not getting into  your business but  we feel like you  betrayed us by  lying and he  might go no  no it's just I  was supposed to go  but my boss  dropped the rope  down the shaft  you know then  fuck him detach  from him because  what can he  possibly offer you  if he's just  fucking lying all  the time I  think if you talk  to him about it  you and your  friend together  without being these  accusing dickheads  saying look man we  still love you but  what's going on  with this and  maybe you'll help  him and if he  just lies lie lie  lie lie lie fib  lie fib story  lie fib then just  fucking walk away 
[03:38:30]  from him  fair enough  all right  hey thank you  very much  good luck buddy  let's see Jordan  in New York  hey Jimmy how  you doing  I'm good Jordan  you have  hypochondria  yeah man I  mean for about  five years and  and it's definitely  it's high anxiety  you know I get a  lot of panic attacks  but recently I  had like last  week I had this  allergy attack I  was in the car I  was you know  coming home and  and I was in  traffic I'm like 
[03:39:00]  fuck I'm dying  like these thoughts  run into my head  I'm like fuck  what's happening  what's happening  what's happening  I pull over go  to the ER the  first thing they  say to me is like  have you ever had  anxiety before and  I said yeah but  don't you find out  what's wrong with  me turns out they  did all the shit  nothing was wrong  they gave me  they gave me  benedict because I  had a little bit  of allergies I  still do but it's  just fucking  destroying my life  because all I can  do is google  symptoms think about  what I have and  it ruins really I'm  a good looking dude  I'm a writer so I'm  always on the  computer I'm always  you know but that's  also bad because I'm 
[03:39:30]  always googling shit  and then you know I  think a lot because  you think a lot because  you're a writer you  start coming up with  these fucking things  and at what point do  I say like who  gives a shit like if  you die you die  whatever just live but  I could say that  intellectually but  it doesn't travel I  know what you mean  you you know the  words but it doesn't  have the meaning for  you it's part you  know I think that's  an OCD or some  sort of there's  obviously a reason  people have that and  again I suggest  therapy a lot because  there's a way to it's  easy to go hey you  know just buy yourself  a new pair of shoes 
[03:40:00]  but there's a real  process to have to  work through to get  over that but it is  possible to get over  it I don't understand  exactly what causes  hypochondria I know  Carlin's bit on germs  and how fucking  obsessed we are with  it it drives me crazy  people's obsession with  germs and there is a  self-centeredness with  it and a self-obsession  but I don't know what  the process is to get  over just go to a  therapist or read a  self-help book about it  people have been  through what you're  going through just 
[03:40:30]  understand that your  mind 90% of the time  with that stuff is  bullshitting you 5% of  the time it's not  bullshitting you but  it's wrong so 5% of  the time you're  actually going to get  sick and the other  95% it's all shit  it's crap  the problem is every  now and then like I  go to a guy and say  and you know say these  and he'll be like yeah  maybe you should get  that checked out  like if he has no  fucking idea I have  hypochondria and then  I panic my oh shit  this guy must know  something but I'm  starting to realize  that my brain and  everybody else's  brain works in  cycle like you were  kind of saying 90% of 
[03:41:00]  the time it's just  your brain you can't  rationalize your brain  it's the one doing  it to you how old  are you I'm 27 okay  27 what is the  average human being  lived to like not  80 maybe so what's  it what your  hypochondria what  are you gonna do  instead of being 75  you're gonna live to  80 like if fucking  just enjoy like none  of us want to get  sick and be smart  about it but you  know the hypochondria  is just ruining your  life what's the use  to living longer if  all you do it is  worried about living  longer it's worthless  it's valueless  right right all 
[03:41:30]  right man thanks so  much okay man hope  you're not sick you  sound sick okay he  didn't sound very  good I would have my  throat checked you  might have cancer  all right Terry in  Chicago Terry in Chicago  Terry hello Trev yes  you are Terry you're on  the radio my wife's got  a uh she's been  diagnosed with a tilted  cervix okay and sex is  very painful for her um 
[03:42:00]  and I mean every time we  have sex it's almost like  you know it's like a it's  like a rape or something  I mean I can only get  like what are you  bragging  I get like two inches of  my cock in and she's  like running away from me  on the bed  all right so what is she  the only woman ever born  without a mouth or  asshole there's other  ways  well yeah but uh I  don't know I don't know  she's not that kind of  cow but she's not that  kind of gal well she 
[03:42:30]  won't blow you no we're  we're kind of past that  stage dude we've been  married 20 years I don't  know um wow okay uh I  don't know I would just  say fuck her slower I don't  know I mean if she's not  willing to blow you what is  your question how do you  fix a tilted cervix  that I don't know you  know get a fucking I don't  know just figure out lay  her on her back try fuck  her that way put her on 
[03:43:00]  her stomach and fuck her  that there's got to be one  way you can stick it in  where her cervix is the  right direction  okay how do you fix a  tilted cervix I don't know  divorce her that's what I  would do just jerk off on  her I'm not a doctor oh  the tilted cervix  she stuck with me for a  rough time so oh okay you  know you can stick with her  broken veg all right thank  you  okay let's see here I'm 
[03:43:30]  reading my twitter my my  text I'm sorry uh uh  tatted Reno  hey Jeremy hi Ted hey um I'm  dying I'm really into  exhibitionist stuff you want  to have sex with your  girlfriend publicly no I'm  actually I want her like to  show off in public now you  want other men to want to  fuck her yeah yeah that too but  uh mostly I like to get the 
[03:44:00]  reactions of other guys when  they you know see one of her  tits out or bending over and  seeing her ass in public but  that's not her thing no so why  are you dating someone that's  that's always so different from  you I really like her she's a  good person what does she say  when you ask about this she just  says it's a bit trashy and uh  she's got that Catholic guilt  but grew up being trashy I know 
[03:44:30]  what you mean by that but is it  something that you how long you  been dating her a few years about  three four years oh wow okay so  she's probably not going to  change well you have to make a  decision what's more important to  you is it more important to you is  the sex good with her yes so this  is just a fetish of yours that  she's not honoring right well what's  more important to you do you enjoy  the relationship more or is  meeting someone who will love this  fetish more important to you yeah I  think she's more important well 
[03:45:00]  then you've answered your own  question it sucks to date somebody  who won't honor that this is one  thing that's one I can almost  understand her not wanting to do  because they a lot of women might  feel threatened showing their tits  off like that or whatever but a lot  of women don't understand what their  boyfriends or husbands need sexually  and don't want to do it they wonder  why we're jerking off to porn  constantly see that you also might  want to reject maybe you have a bit  of a sexual addiction too I mean  maybe maybe the problem is not her  being unwilling to do something but  it's your addiction that needs her to 
[03:45:30]  do that just to to feel good or to  take it up a level so maybe you might  want to address that  all right general thank you okay good  luck I mean I understand wanting  something what was Brian in El Paso  saying about determination I ran out of  fuck huh all right what's your  question Brian it's uh getting the  determination to write the  determination to write what do you  want to write  um you know I teach and work about 10 
[03:46:00]  blocks from the international border  here in El Paso and there's really  interesting stories I think you know I  heard your interview with Shane Smith  and um you know I was just wondering  what your process is and uh you know  like what powers you to say you know  someone's going to be interested in this  because you know there are times I'm  like you know I just you know I'm like  am I being like am I feeding my own ego  here thinking that there's an audience  no but you want to write but 
[03:46:30]  sometimes what happens is the question  is not how do I get inspired it's how  do I get rid of the laziness that is  stopping me from writing because that's  what prevents me from writing it's a  laziness I like the idea of having a  completed book one thing you might want  to do is why don't you try talking a lot  of stuff into a recorder speak it out get  it out sometimes getting it out is very  important and then you can go back over  and transcribe it or if you have the  money hire someone to transcribe it and 
[03:47:00]  then you'll have it on paper in front of  you and then you can go in and edit it  and see if there's anything interesting  but if you want to just get those raw  thoughts out there before you lose them  then talk it into a recorder or make  yourself do what you don't want to do  make yourself sit down in front of the  computer and just kind of brain diarrhea a  little bit and see what comes out and  you may realize it's what you love or you  may realize you don't like it at all but  you have the inspiration because you want  to do it so you need to just do it in  spite of the laziness preventing you 
[03:47:30]  yeah you know like it's also like the  internet is so fucking fascinating that I  always get diverted yeah me too so write  in a public place right can you write in a  public place like a Starbucks I wrote a  lot of my books in the comedy cellar  because I couldn't jerk off there that's  the truth I would like look at porn and  stuff but I couldn't jack off because I  was in public but there was just enough  distraction I need a little bit of  outside distraction so I can look up  once in a while and think and then all 
[03:48:00]  of a sudden my mind is reset so go  somewhere public like a park or a  fucking thing that has some Wi-Fi or  you don't need Wi-Fi if you want to  write but where you won't get so  distracted go somewhere in the public  where you can't jerk off but you can  look up a little bit and you know where  you have a balance of outside stimuli and  also you can focus on what you're  doing cool man I appreciate it all  right my friend good luck Chris lucky  motherfucker in New Jersey girlfriend's  an escort yes she is so do you drive her 
[03:48:30]  all over oh I thought you meant the car  so now was she an escort when you met  her yes and I had my suspicions about  it and how'd you meet her um I met her  uh a dating site okay and uh she charge  you no no uh everything's good um yeah  everything's fine I just find myself um I  she told me about it and what do you call  it I find myself uh going online and and  reading reviews about her and stuff like 
[03:49:00]  that she's telling me she's she's not  doing it that she's only uh helping some  other girls out but um there's just  things on there that um would lead me to  believe that it's definitely her um and  it turns me on okay you know it turns  me on I do I I guess I'm jealous that  she's able to go out there and do it and  and get paid you know and uh you know  but um I don't know what you want to do  is this call her from another number or  email her and see if you can get a  picture  yeah I've considered that yeah do you 
[03:49:30]  want her to be an escort  um no I mean I really love the girl  she's she's sweet she's great um you  know I just we have a great time  together sex is awesome okay yeah well  then just enjoy it if you don't care  just enjoy it right she should be  honest with you though that's how long  you been dating her um seven months oh  okay well she should be honest with  you yeah yeah definitely but uh she  wanted to tell you got three three 11  days today sober clean oh good good  good man good for you so you're 
[03:50:00]  definitely a great influence on me  thank you buddy keep going with that  his life gets very good all right man  take care bud  damon in uh north jersey he spoke to me  three weeks ago about breaking up with  his gal  jim what's going on how are you i'm  well buddy thank you for calling  okay i appreciate your advice last time  uh i tried it out um and i don't want  to be long-winded with my uh my  question here because i'm sure you're  probably wondering you know what  happened with your advice or whatever  um i did uh you know i spoke to her 
[03:50:30]  directly like you said uh what was the  what was the in a bit a very brief  nutshell what was the issue i don't  remember  um my initial my actual like question  was basically should i break up my  girlfriend at this point uh because  she occasionally smokes weed like you  know once every week or two okay uh  because i have such an issue with it  okay and um basically um we we talked  or whatever uh we didn't she she really 
[03:51:00]  didn't uh what's it called she didn't  really uh budge on it if you know there  was no compromise made or anything like  that the only thing i can say is that  there's been opportunities where she  could have smoked at this point and um  basically you know hasn't like has  avoided it if you will um but at this  point my my bigger question and  concern is that i think it's more on on  my end and i'm trying to figure out  why because you mentioned it last time  when i called why do i have such an  issue with you know uh substance 
[03:51:30]  because are you an addict i i am a  previous addict i've been clean for  three years oh that's why okay we  none of us like to see people enjoying  what we can't enjoy sometimes something  you might have to like and again  somebody doing addictive things but  if someone's smoking pot once or twice  a week if you feel it's going to affect  your recovery in a bad way then you  have to break up with them if they  don't want to change that and both  people are right you're okay to want to  break up and she's okay to not want to  change that because maybe she's not an  addict but if she's not an addict and 
[03:52:00]  and if you feel like hey this is not  really affecting my recovery other than  the fact that i'm a little jealous that  she can do it and i can't well then you  might want to examine it because that's  like some people who are sober will not  date anybody that drinks and that's a  prerogative um but it's like let's just  say you met a social drinker somebody  that when you go out to dinner once in  a while wants to have a glass of wine  like i don't mind that at all but can i  date someone who's a fucking falling  down drunk absolutely not um my ex-girlfriend 
[03:52:30]  and i had an issue because she would  smoke a lot of pot and then come over  and she reeked of pot and the problem  was i'm like i don't care if you smoke  pot but don't do it right before you see  me because that smell is hard um that's a  trigger for me that's what we had we  had an agreement worked out in the  beginning for that yeah that's fair for  you guys okay um maybe she's trying you  know if she's given up a couple  opportunities maybe she's trying to not  do it maybe she's because no one wants  to be told what to do and nobody wants  to feel like a mother hen is telling 
[03:53:00]  them don't smoke pot because that's the  shit she gets from her parents and you  know and teachers whatever or she would  have gotten at one point so you know  maybe she feels like she's doing it on  her own now out of respect for you even  though initially she didn't budge yeah  now i want to ask because you mentioned  like with the alcohol or whatever like  um even like again she's not an addict  and even like last night i can think of  like you know she had a few drinks and  um you know if it goes if anything even  goes a little bit sour like i go straight  to that i get just vindictive and and uh  just pity about the fact that that she 
[03:53:30]  even like you know had a few drinks and  you know i know what you mentioned about  because i'm an ex-addict and all that  but i remember as far back as like being  like 11 years old like if you know people  in the family would like uh get drunk or  whatever like i still had these like  weird feel like these resentful feelings and  i just you know obviously i wasn't an addict  back then or if i was i wasn't you know  using yet so i'll see if you have any  insight into that i don't know maybe uh 
[03:54:00]  maybe you've seen it destroy people in  your life um yeah you know it's sometimes  we you know we see you know bad shit  happening because of alcohol and drugs we  we develop a resentment against it we're  like anything else you know i don't know  i you know i don't want to make up  something that's not true like about it's  a fact so yeah maybe that's all it is is  that you just did not uh maybe you just  don't like to see other people doing it  because a it's hurt other people or b  you're jealous all right yeah because i 
[03:54:30]  mean i've tried through two years of  drug counseling to figure out what is on  my end that way and you keep saying x by  the way you keep saying x addict you're  still an addict you're just not using  keep that in mind i'm sure you know that  but keep it in mind right okay good  luck buddy thank you jim and now  joshua in texas really jealous guy and  the callers on this show are what  joshua hello joshua i'm like professor  falcon hi joshua hey jim how you doing  i'm well buddy i listen to the show all 
[03:55:00]  the time for me and uh my problem is i  lost my parents whenever i was younger  and uh whenever me and my wife got  married uh she was pretty much my  saving grace you know i was into drugs  and all kinds of stuff and uh you know  she really helped me pull me out of a  dark place uh we're both christians  and we're she's a great woman um but  every time i listen to the show and i  hear these guys calling in saying that  they want their wives to fuck other men  it just fucked my mind up just thinking 
[03:55:30]  about what if my wife did that and i mean  i get so fucked up in the head  it'll completely ruin my day yeah i i'm  sorry go ahead um i've never told her  anything uh you know how i am or  whatnot it's so bad that i try to take  things to the next level in our bedroom  with just me and her but like uh we'll  go out to a porn store and buy toys and  whatnot but if i if we start using the 
[03:56:00]  toys then i even get fucked up over the  toys well that's give a little dick no  man okay i'm like six foot six with an  eight inch banger so okay i'm only asking  that because a lot of times that's the  thing we're afraid a girl's gonna find a  bigger you know uh one one thing that's  i've noticed at one point is i was very  very jealous for many years very jealous  guy very insecure because that's what  jealousy basically is is you're insecure  um you know there's times where jealousy 
[03:56:30]  is appropriate if your girl's acting like  a fucking whore in a bar but the majority  of times it's nothing that serious it's  just us and then i for some reason turned  it around and began to get turned on by  the idea of a girl and with fucking  somebody else so there's no reason that  you should think that you shouldn't that  you should be turned on by that a lot of  guys don't want to picture their girl  fucking anybody else don't want to hear  about her history that's very that's  probably more normal being a jealous of  toys are you an only child no man i  no i've got an older sister and uh my 
[03:57:00]  father was an ex or he was a sheriff and  uh man he really fucked us up real bad so  yeah yeah we are both me and my sister  both are very insecure i'm wondering if  it had anything to do with the idea of  attention being focused on anybody other  than you like um because again if you're  jealous that the toys are getting the  attention or they're they're making her  feel good and you're not it could be  something to do with that too because to  obsess all day wondering about uh you said 
[03:57:30]  you lost your parents early yes i lost my  dad when i was 12 lost my mom when i was  20 oh okay that's not that early i'm not  taking away from it but i'm saying i thought  you meant when you were like a little  little kid uh i don't know is it a fear  being left where uh you know i'm you  start obsessing like she's gonna see  somebody and find somebody better than  me and leave me it could be that but i  don't think not wanting your girl to fuck  with the people is abnormal i think  that's very very normal letting other  guys think that way and then ruining  your day is not good who cares what they 
[03:58:00]  do and don't worry about your girl doing  it i mean do you cheat on her absolutely  not well then she's probably not cheating  on you no i don't think she would ever  ever cheat or leave i think uh you know  we were made for each other and that  we're fine where we are uh i will say  that i can't get off in the bedroom unless  i see her uh enjoying herself like it  there's no such thing as a quickie in  our house because i'm not going to see  her enjoying herself right i'm not going 
[03:58:30]  to get off so yeah you're right if if the  toy is uh producing things that i'm not  then yeah i get all fucked up in the  head too it's like why is she why is she  getting off on the toy does she like it  better what what the fuck well it sounds  to me like you have a very good marriage  and a good sex life and you're just  throwing a mental monkey wrench into it  for nothing you're making up scenarios and  fantasies that are not reality just to 
[03:59:00]  make yourself feel bad just to give  yourself something uncomfortable to  think about why are you throwing this  mental monkey wrench into a fun situation  you got a woman that you love to fuck  and you enjoy her and she's faithful and  you're faithful so any of the other stuff  is just mental noise it's silly  yeah that's uh yeah yeah that's pretty  much it you know it's the equivalent of  it's the equivalent of you're out to a  nice dinner and all you can think about  is if what if we get food poisoning you 
[03:59:30]  know enjoy what you have if she fucks  somebody or if you think she's fucking  somebody then address it but if not then  just don't even think about it don't  drive yourself crazy think it's not  gonna happen why don't you just think  about what happens if she decides to go  on the Mars expedition and leave you  it's nonsense enjoy it man you're lucky  to have someone who's not cheating on  you and you're not cheating on her  thank you sir okay  Joe  think she's becoming asexual why Joe 
[04:00:00]  I don't know I don't know if that's the  right word but I don't feel like I have  anywhere near the sex job I should have  how old are you is your testosterone  dropped I don't think so but like I mean  obviously I'm 33 okay and obviously when  I was younger I got laid I did all stuff  and I definitely enjoy those things but  like it's been maybe a year and a half  now and I don't find myself out seeking  it like I think I should you know yeah  because men I'm sorry to interrupt you  but what you just said is very key like I  think I should if you have zero sex 
[04:00:30]  drive that's one thing but man there's  so much attention paid to women's  sexuality very little paid to men we  think that we are supposed to want to  fuck all the time we think like if you  were the girl and she wants you to stick  your cock in but you're not hard you  don't want to she's like what's wrong  with me like it's perfectly acceptable  for them not to want to fuck but if we  don't want to fuck we immediately  question our masculinity or our virility  or we think what's wrong with me why  don't I want to maybe you just don't 
[04:01:00]  have as high of a drive as you used to  that doesn't mean you're becoming  asexual yeah I don't know I just like  I don't I mean part of it I think it's  just I'm a selfish single guy and I  enjoy that lifestyle you know and I  don't want that ruined sure which is  more and more than obviously sex stuff  I mean don't get me wrong if a girl  threw herself at me I'm gonna take  advantage of you know yes so I don't  want to go through the upper I mean I  jerk off like any guy but even that is  not always based on a sexual fantasy  that's a whole nother issue you know  it's a weird thing there too I don't  know and like I said I guess which  condition to think that makes us wrong 
[04:01:30]  do you have some interest in sex yeah  like I said I would absolutely like I  said and there's been interest you know  if I'm especially if you're out there  having a good time and the girls are you  know I just don't actively seek it out  maybe you're right maybe that's not a  wrong thing but it feels odd do you  think Bill Gates you think Bill Gates or  Zuckerberg actively sought it out like a  lot of guys who are massively  successful it's because their  priorities are other places I'm sure  those guys don't fuck that often like 
[04:02:00]  Zuckerberg's dating is married his  college sweetheart you know a lot of  these guys probably did not pursue sex  very much I mean maybe on some of them  did but so many of the successful guys  were probably not pussyhounds so you're  probably in very good company and the  fact that you're not thinking about it  that often or not really pursuing it I  don't think is normal is abnormal at all  and you know if it goes years where  you don't want it well that's you might  want to address that but I'm sure you'll  find somebody and want to fuck her and  have a normal sex life I think things 
[04:02:30]  get so out of whack and we're so used to  extreme and abnormal and pornography in  this day and age that if we don't want to  fuck we think there's something  immediately wrong with us all right well  I guess I need people in the world like  me to balance out folks like so all  right well good luck to you all right  great guys a eunuch yeah you're great  in Game of Thrones let's see oh god Dan  in Iowa yeah okay good I was gonna  suggest that yeah of course you are it's  got a parental issue  Dan yeah how you doing today Jim hi buddy 
[04:03:00]  how old is your son we only have a couple  minutes he's about 14 years old my wife  could run with me 15 years ago and we're a  biracial couple and he's black and I'm  trying to find a way of telling him you're  biracial he's black you're white so your  wife cheated on you 15 years ago yes  and is your son all black yes now your  wife obviously you know for a fact he's  not yours oh yeah yeah he doesn't know 
[04:03:30]  no not at all are you angry at your wife  no I've been married with her for 14 years  I'm still married with her no no but I'm  but are you angry at her for that no no no I  love her to death when you see this kid  do you are you reminded of what she did no I  love the boy to death so why do you I need  to tell him sooner or later because he's  already asking quite I got two other  children that are mixed oh he's asking  questions oh okay okay well what does your 
[04:04:00]  wife think I think she's I haven't heard any  very close I mean him are really close and  yeah I got to tell him because we never  pretty tight so I need to tell him sometime  in the future here because yeah if he's 15  and you're not telling him just because  you're angry at your wife if he's really  asking you want to just be truthful with  your son it's not like he's five at 15  years old you might want to tell him the  truth if he's asking maybe the two of you  tell him together look I made a mistake  years ago or whatever it was but what 
[04:04:30]  about the kid's father where is he I've  never seen him oh okay now does she never  kept in touch with him never was it a one  night stand maybe a couple weeks into it I  think like two or three weeks I'm not too  sure okay we're two or third shift so I  missed a lot of stuff at the time okay  well you seem to be handling it pretty  well but I would suggest telling him the  truth then as little as I know about that  type of issue because I've never dealt  with it but if he's asking and you have a 
[04:05:00]  close relationship with him I can't  encourage you to lie to him you should  probably tell him the truth and maybe you  and your wife tell him together like  however you want to phrase it you know  like you know we got good news and bad  news the bad news is I'm not your father  the good news is I'm not going to act like  I'm not your father then elbow him well  good luck man I would suggest just telling  him the truth then if he's been asking  yeah I just try a fair way of doing it  it's just kind of a hard thing to do I'm  sure it is if you want just have him 
[04:05:30]  email me I'll straighten him right out  oh yeah I'll do that right away your  mother's very naughty all right good luck  I would tell him thank you very much  Jim bye but then again I wouldn't I  wouldn't probably stay with it this is a  different guy than I am so we're done I  have no more time well I apologize to  those of you I did not get to quickly my  boss wants me to have sex with his wife  while he's something all right do it  enjoy I want to be made meds legally from  Canada but doesn't I don't know anything  about meds from Canada I wouldn't trust 
[04:06:00]  meds from Canada they're probably not as  good as meds from the US like everything  else from Canada I have a long time  girlfriend but I need advice on what to  do next do next I would just say jerk off  in her hair while she's sleeping and  George says how do I approach about  getting a happy ending in a massage just  pointing a dick and go huh huh see that I  help people even in the clothes I have to  take a shit  deal with your poses dealing with your  poses dealing with your poses dealing  with your poses dealing with your poses
