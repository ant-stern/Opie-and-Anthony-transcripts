<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with discussions surrounding the "Naughty Nighty" and "55-gallon drum" contests, both seeking female participants, lamenting the lack of local New York women participating compared to those calling from other states.  Opie recounted his cousin Sarah Hughes' Olympic gold medal win, leading to a digression on figure skating judging and competitors.  A significant portion detailed Jim Norton's disastrous stand-up set at Dangerfield's, contrasting it with his experiences at The Comedy Cellar.  This led to broader discussions about stand-up comedy experiences, with numerous callers sharing their own anecdotes, many containing vulgar language and sexually suggestive content. Several callers made offensive remarks about Jim Norton's appearance. One caller even described graphic photos of a brutal assault.

The show also featured calls discussing the hosts' meeting with their boss, Ken Stevens, and a televised eating contest, "The Glutton Bowl," focusing on the unseen vomiting.  Scheduled guests Rich Voss and Kevin Meaney were repeatedly mentioned. Opie shared rambling stories about his dysfunctional family, involving his father, cement, and a missing relative.  A short audio clip of a previous "55-gallon drum" contestant blowing bubbles in a toilet bowl was played.  Several callers, often from distant locations, offered bizarre suggestions for participation in the challenges.

Anthony discussed his family's bumper sticker business, while a call with Steve C. from Las Vegas detailed his gambling losses and encounters with Tony Orlando and a magician.  In-studio guests included Mikey, Voss (who showed pictures, including one advertising his appliance center), and Chris (who played a distorted audio recording).  A lengthy segment featured Kevin Meaney promoting his upcoming shows at Caroline's.  Two female guests, Lady Di and Marion, engaged in a highly informal and confrontational discussion, marked by frequent interruptions, vulgar language, sexually suggestive comments, and self-deprecating remarks using the word "retarded".  Marion's husband, Joe, even called in.  A caller known only as "Frenchie" also contributed to the vulgar and sexually suggestive banter.

The later portion of the show featured Kevin Meaney and Rich Voss in studio.  Much of this section revolved around a mysterious "government golf course" and Lady Di, whose evasiveness about her job fueled comedic speculation.  The conversation veered into JFK's assassination (with a humorous conspiracy theory), Lady Di's job (described as moving tables or street cleaning), and her transportation issues.  Voss's habit of rubbing his ear and offering his finger to smell (described as smelling of grape jelly by Voss, but earwax or a dead animal by others) became a recurring bit.  Numerous phone calls offered perspectives on the in-studio conversations.  The show concluded with a heated exchange with a caller named Dice, whose increasingly bizarre and vulgar conversation, including a sexually suggestive description of an ice sculpture, led to hang-ups and arguments with Kevin Meaney, followed by promotion of the guests' upcoming performances and a recap of humorous moments from the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Friday! Friday!  Friday!  How you guys doing?  Ooh, yeah, who you? I ain't calling you, lady.  Ooh. Ooh.  Uh-uh. Ooh.  Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ooh. Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha.  You know my brother. You've got to buy your own. 
[00:00:30]  Hey, everybody! We're all gonna get laid!  Liar! Liar!  Oh, gee. I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  It looks like you're just about to roll it over your wiener.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, I'm in a drag! 
[00:01:00]  Okay.  What are you, gay?  Yeah. Wait, what?  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Hey, man.  Say, dear, Paul.  Ha-ha!  Cancel your appointment!  Remember, you're a drag queen!  I'll kick you in, I'm not.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I love you guys. I feel like I've known you forever. 
[00:01:30]  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  How's that for a topper?  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Hey!  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else outside of New  York, give us a call, huh? 866-277-4-WOW. 
[00:02:00]  Lots to do, once again, today, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Right off the bat, got to remind people to vote for their favorite in the Naughty Nighty  Contest.  Yes.  We will announce a winner on Tuesday's show.  You can vote every day through the weekend, so make sure you do that at opiananthony.com.  Okay?  Right.  Also, hopefully more ladies will stop by today for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes, what did we get?  Two contestants?  Two.  Yesterday?  We got two girls that came down and definitely impressed us, and they will be here for the 
[00:02:30]  55-gallon drum challenge.  One girl ate chocolate-covered lamb eyeballs, and the other one put her head in our very  own toilet here at our studios, and blew bubbles.  And blew bubbles.  Do we have that audio?  We should play that really.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was disgusting.  Yeah, and she was in her bra and panties at the time.  Yeah, because we know what goes on in that bathroom on a daily basis.  It was so hot. 
[00:03:00]  Didn't you just want to grab her by the top of the hair, pull her head out of the toilet,  and give her, like, a punch to the side of the face?  And just stick her head back in?  Oh, oh, oh.  Just cram it in there while she's trying to get some air, like a small Andrea Yates child.  Jesus, Dan.  What?  What did that girl do to you?  Nothing.  I actually liked her.  I just, you know.  She's from Taunton.  I just thought it would, uh...  She's going to be representing Taunton.  The appropriate. 
[00:03:30]  In the 55-gallon drum challenge.  That look like that.  I just wanted to do that.  I thought she was quite lovely.  Yeah.  We have five positions left in the 55-gallon drum challenge, Ant.  We had a girl that was going to drive all the way from Cleveland.  Yeah.  And we even said on the air, if you're not coming, tell us now.  Don't get our hopes up.  No, I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  Uh-huh.  She called Rick about an hour ago.  She ain't coming.  She's not coming.  She had a problem with her daughter.  And then blah, blah, blah.  Fake, uh, excuse. 
[00:04:00]  It's like blah, blah, blah.  Okay, goodbye.  Thanks for wasting our time once again.  Another lady wasting our time on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Paul, come down.  She said she was going to do a Cleveland steamer and put her face in it.  Right.  She's going to just dump one and put her face in it.  Right.  Too good to be true.  I knew it.  So, she is not coming.  No.  Bitch.  When the guys say they're coming down and do something for the show, they're here.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, they get here way too early.  They're pains in the asses.  Yeah, that's right. 
[00:04:30]  When we put the word out, we can't even get our work done because they show up like three  hours before the show.  Right.  Getting our face and stuff.  They're so excited to be here.  Ladies, they blow us off all the time.  Oh, Opie and Anthony, there's ten guys upstairs?  I know.  It's like, what?  It's noon.  And we only ask for three.  I know.  Well, they bring all their friends.  Yeah, they bring their friends.  Imagine the girls, 55-gallon drum challenge.  Oh, they're all full.  It's okay.  We brought five of our friends each anyway.  It just doesn't happen with you girls.  Now, new rule, by the way.  A six-pack of beer per person. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Right.  If you come to visit us and you bring five friends, do the math.  Yeah, it's going to cost you.  It's going to cost you.  Because they come here and drink all of our beer.  Well, that's the only reason I'm doing it.  Bastards.  We go through our beer really fast.  So that's one thing we're doing today.  Hopefully, some ladies will call up with things they want to do to impress us to get in on  the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Okay?  Right.  Also, Rich Voss stopping by today?  Yep.  All right.  Oh, the incomparable Rich Voss from his whirlwind tour of London, England. 
[00:05:30]  Old London town.  Is he going to be stopping by?  Yeah, he's stopping by.  And an old friend of the show.  I don't even know why we have him on, but he does good radio, sort of.  Kevin Meany.  Kevin Meany.  With his website and stuff.  Right.  The Meany Cam.  He's a little shocked when he comes in and sees us.  Well, there's always something weird going on, so that's good.  We come from two different planes on this planet, but somehow it works. 
[00:06:00]  Well, when he's been here in the past, we've had stuff going on that I can honestly say  I don't think he's ever seen in his life.  Those gargantuan boob girl.  Wasn't she here that one day?  And then we might have had the wiffle ball that challenge when he was in.  Yeah.  And the girl had the string.  Yeah.  That was another time that that seems to always happen anyway.  Yeah, he seems to come by for some of the likes of it.  Yeah, I think he likes us.  Or he wouldn't have come back, right?  He seems like one of those guys that would just dress in a clown outfit and kill men and 
[00:06:30]  hide them in the basement.  Doesn't he have that look about him?  Hey, how you doing?  All fun and dandy until those cuffs slap on you unexpectedly?  And you get that beating of your life?  Sure.  That's not right.  That's not right, handcuffing people and then killing them and burying them in the basement.  We're going to lose the house.  So, when is he coming by?  About 4.30.  4.30 we'll have Kevin Meany on.  All righty.  I guess ratings came in today for the New York market. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  And I guess we don't subscribe to the ratings anymore.  So, we really don't know how we did.  And that's the God's honest truth.  We're hearing rumors that we did okay.  Nothing great.  We did hear that the rest of the station tanked horribly.  From what I saw, we were what they call on an even keel.  We really didn't move anywhere, is what I saw. 
[00:07:30]  What my spies are saying is the station general did really bad.  Yeah.  We did okay.  Not great.  Right.  We are truly still an island at this radio station in New York.  Uh-huh.  But our island, Anthony?  Getting a little smaller.  It is getting a bit smaller.  Getting a little smaller.  The tide's coming in.  Are we at the point now where we're clinging to that single palm tree in the middle of the island?  No, it's not.  Looking for the coconuts to fall?  It's not that bad at all.  Not that bad.  We still have some sprawling beaches? 
[00:08:00]  Because other islands out there?  Not even see the top of the tree.  No, other islands out there, they were getting pretty big, but a lot of people are fleeing.  Oh.  So, now a lot of those people kind of have to swim their way back to our island.  Oh.  How's that for an analogy?  But our island right now is at high tide.  It's high tide, yeah.  It's high tide.  We need the tide to go out.  We need the tide to go out and these people that are leaving these other islands to find their way back to our island.  And we'll be just fine. 
[00:08:30]  Mm-hmm.  How's that for an analogy?  That's a pretty good analogy.  Where is the News Talk Island?  Well, the News Talk Island was turning into a mainland.  It's a resort community for a while there.  9-11 turned the news station here in New York into a mainland.  Yes.  It used to be an itty-bitty island that...  Right.  Barely anyone visited it.  We didn't really pay attention.  Yeah.  There was always hurricane season going on and stuff.  Right.  We didn't really pay attention. 
[00:09:00]  But because of 9-11, they made some room.  Why would we pay attention to them when we were sitting on Atlantique?  You know?  But now, all of a sudden, we've had some storms and...  But now...  The water is watching up a little higher to the resort.  But now that it's been four months, the News Station Island...  Yeah.  There's a lot of beach erosion happening, Anthony.  Yeah.  And the jetties aren't holding the sand where they should be.  Opie, the News Talk Island has a name.  Australia.  It was... 
[00:09:30]  That is indeed an island.  It went from Black Island to Australia.  Australia.  After 9-11.  But those people are fleeing.  Oh, my God.  It went from Roosevelt Island.  I don't know...  I don't know which is...  Which is worse, I guess.  People fleeing Cuba or people fleeing the News Island.  Yes.  That's one saving grace, is that people are getting on their inner tubes and their pieces 
[00:10:00]  of wood and whatever else they need to make their way back.  I just hope there's no storms as they try to make their way back to our island.  We don't want any winter storms.  No more storms, please.  No.  We had a big enough storm in September.  We don't need a tsunami right now, because all those people from those other islands, they're  out there in the ocean.  That was a tsunami, September 11th.  And they're paddling their way back.  Yeah.  God, I hope they're paddling their way back.  Paddle.  Paddle, people. 
[00:10:30]  Or Ant and I are going to have to make like Tom Hanks and go for it.  Build that raft and just go for it and see what happens.  Find ourselves another island, if you know what I mean.  Well, there you go.  We'll see how it pans out in the end.  While Voss was in England, did he visit any sites that were as old as his jokes?  Jim from Jersey.  Here they go, Mraz.  In England, they call him Ye Olde Jokes.  Ye Olde Voss Jokes. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Do you guys want to hear the bubbling toilet from yesterday?  Yeah.  This girl's going to be in our 55-gallon drum challenge.  She proved her worth and her mettle.  She came in here and allowed us to stick her head in a toilet bowl.  That's right.  Here it is.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Rick.  Rick, is she ready?  Yeah, she's ready.  She's staring face first into the bowl.  Are we taking video of this?  Yeah.  Stinky's running video and she knows she's got to do it for five seconds and blow bubbles. 
[00:11:30]  I want to hear gurgling.  Get the mic right there.  Wait, wait.  Rick, Rick.  Yeah.  She's got to go the distance of a flush, man.  No.  Five seconds.  My hair's going to go down the drain.  Yeah.  Just have her put her face in and blow bubbles.  Ready?  All right.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  That's definitely five seconds.  And there you had it from yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  Can't play anymore because that's the raw tape and she curses after that because she saw a duty in the bowl.  Yes.  A little nugget.  We had to make it interesting.  Someone popped a nugget in the toilet.  But there you go.  She's in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She's in.  Yes.  What's going on?  Yes.  Yes.  Why don't you guys name some names?  Name names in what way?  Like what?  At the station.  At our station? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Why?  Who's doing bad over there?  Who's in the bubble over there?  Everyone did bad.  Every single time.  What's going on?  Everybody did bad.  Is that a mic?  Yeah.  Everyone did bad.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  Nice.  Everyone did bad.  Let's go to Bobby Big Rager.  What's up, Bobby Big Rager?  Hey, guys.  Why don't you just change gears here for a second?  I want to congratulate on your cousin's team gold medal.  I thought when he said change gears, he was just working. 
[00:13:00]  No.  I am, actually.  See?  There we go.  And this is a very happy day for the Hughes family.  Yeah.  The only event I caught, and it was right there at the beginning.  Good job.  That could be Opie's relative.  The Hughes is all over Long Island celebrating Sarah Hughes' gold medal in the Winter Olympics  last night in figure skating.  Hey, Anthony.  How much were you hoping, like I was, that everybody else after hers would slip on the  ice?  Yes.  They did.  Well, uh...  Hold on.  I called it again. 
[00:13:30]  I'm three for three.  The sports curse went the other direction, my friend.  What'd you say?  I predicted the World Series.  I predicted the Super Bowl.  And what did I say about Michelle Kwan two days ago?  I said she will fall.  She will.  I thought it was the ugly slope comment.  I'm going to have to start betting with you.  Huh?  I'm going to have to start betting with you instead of against you like I used to.  I'm on a good roll going the other way now.  I said she would fall while I was praying she would fall, and she fell.  I was at the comedy cell last night looking on it, and we were laughing so hard when  we saw her fall.  Because she just...  She sucked. 
[00:14:00]  This is exactly what I said yesterday when we were talking to the not-fag figure skater.  Michael Weiss.  Michael Weiss.  I was saying that Kwan is...  She expects to win the gold.  She went to the Olympics to win the gold.  That is what she wanted to do.  There you go.  Run them over.  She went there to win the gold, and that's it.  All right, man.  She went there to win the gold, and that's it.  And then they did an interview with Sarah Hughes, and she's like, oh, my God, I was just 
[00:14:30]  so happy to be at the Olympics.  Oh, boy, it's such a thrill just to be here.  I wasn't even thinking about a medal.  I just wanted to skate, and skate great, and she winds up getting the gold.  Michelle Kwan, like, I'm there for the medal.  Like, I need the medal.  And she was very conservative, very holding back.  How stiff.  Overly nervous and concerned.  Yeah.  And this Sarah Hughes, she just said, what the hell?  This is my shot.  I'm 16. 
[00:15:00]  I'm going for it.  And she did.  And now the Rushkis are all pissed off.  These stupid Russians.  Just realize you are a conquered nation that we have decided to allow survive under some flag.  We beat you.  It wasn't a conventional war.  It was a nice little cold war.  But you're a conquered country.  So settle down.  They're talking about bias in the voting.  They want their silver medalist, that slut ski girl. 
[00:15:30]  What's her name?  Slut Skia.  Slut Skia.  Slut Skia.  Slut girl.  It's always funny to see her name in just the first part of her last name.  Slut.  I should talk of mine.  C-U-M-I-A.  Slut Skia.  And they want to give her a gold medal because they say that the voting was biased to the Americans.  It's like, no.  First of all, they should be talking.  They were the ones working hotel room meetings with the French judges over the pad skating.  They were directly involved in that scandal. 
[00:16:00]  And that's the reason the Canadians got that gold.  And now they want their team to get a, their girl to get a gold medal.  She sucked.  She didn't do well.  Not as well as Opie's cousin.  My cousin did great.  Sarah Hughes.  Sarah Hughes.  I think we're going to be throwing a huge party this weekend.  Yeah, it's my cousin, idiot.  I thought I was kidding.  Look at the picture.  You can tell.  It's like, come on.  Look at the family resemblance.  And if that isn't a body that grew up on margarine and sugar sandwiches.  We got audio of Sarah Hughes. 
[00:16:30]  What?  It needs a little setup.  What?  And Rick's going to do it?  No, no.  All you need to know is my cousin.  She won the gold medal.  Well, this is because she doesn't find out until after the Slut Skia girl skates.  So they're doing her scores when she finds out.  All right.  That's where the other is.  There we go.  But still, she did unbelievable high jumping.  But they weren't clean, Scott.  And the five nines a little high on the presentation mark, but a split panel.  What a tough decision to make.  And then you look.  What a huge gold medal. 
[00:17:00]  What an upset.  What an unexpected result.  In an event where you looked at Michelle Blanc, Irina Slutsky, and the other.  But the performance on the line won the gold medal.  Not deserving of that medal from Morgan.  In front of all the medals. 
[00:17:30]  And again.  Those marks determine the podium.  Does that put your face back in such a...  She deserves it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And for Michelle Blanc, Nagano Revisited.  That didn't sound happy.  It did look like...  It did sound like a schoolyard shooting, I guess. 
[00:18:00]  But there you go.  She won the gold last night.  Yes, she did.  Isn't that nice to see her beat that snippy zipper?  Yeah, when she fell, it was just like, all right, that's it.  End of story.  Right when she felt that ice hit her ass, or her ass hit that ice, it was like, all right,  there goes your gold medal.  Bye-bye.  Little yellow dreams just shattered.  Back to the Yankee Cranky shop for another four years.  Bill, what's going on?  Back to the nail place or the sushi place?  Bill, what's going on? 
[00:18:30]  I was a rim pick star.  Yeah, whatever, shut up.  Yeah, whatever.  Bring me a shink-a-roll.  Go ahead, Bill.  Yeah, I just want to know if she developed all those muscles from picking up rocks in  the woods with you as a kid.  Wait, I told that story on the air?  Of course.  Oh, my God.  We've got to retell it one day.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Bill.  Yeah, my dad was insane, man.  Was she allowed to go out and skate when you and her burnt down the woods behind your  house?  I told that story on the air, too. 
[00:19:00]  Look, all your embarrassing family story.  Oh, my God.  And I want to know if your grandma called her precious.  Oh.  No, that's the other side of the family.  The side we don't talk to.  Ah, that side.  Everyone's got that side.  I got a side that we don't talk to.  Is this the one that just disappeared one day?  No, that was Karen.  That was Karen.  But she looks like Karen.  Does she?  Yeah.  I have another side of my family. 
[00:19:30]  You know, the other side of my family.  I have cousins on that side I've never met.  Really?  Yeah, I have an aunt that used to be a policewoman.  I haven't seen her in, I don't know, 25 years.  Isn't that odd?  My mom's sister.  You just kind of wrote that side off?  Is that what happened?  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Any bad things happen that, uh...  Yeah, they're a bunch of twats.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I never really got that.  My mom's sister's a twat.  Is that what it is?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  She's probably miserable, running away somewhere.  Has no friends.  And no family.  Some grudges there happened, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I never understood that family grudge thing.  She wanted my grandma's house to herself.  Was that it?  So there you go, you got a cute little house in Astoria, no family, no friends, and you're  rotting away, you twat.  So when grandma died, she got the house through some kind of finagling?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  And now everybody kind of...  It's not even that great of a house.  Really?  Yeah.  And then everybody just like says, all right, that's the...  So she's living in a house with a lot of hummels and a lot of mothballs around.  Lonely.  Mothballs strewn about.  Is she going to die in her dog leader kind of life?  She might have died already.  We don't know.  You don't even know?  We have no clue.  Wow.  No idea.  Hmm.  Anyway.  Interesting.  A little uncomfortable at the same time.  My dad was a psychopath, though, with the rocks in the woods, Ant. 
[00:21:00]  Really?  I should get my brothers on the phone.  He loved cement.  Yeah, that's...  We were always cementing walls around our property.  That was like a busy work for you kids?  I don't know what it was.  All of a sudden, he's turning into little masons.  We found a sand pit in the back of our house, and we were cementing for, I am not kidding,  a decade straight.  With the sand that...  We built walls upon walls upon walls.  And by the time we finished the last wall, the first wall was already getting old and 
[00:21:30]  falling down, so we had to redo that one.  You don't find that a little strange?  And then we had cement paths that led to everywhere.  We had cement paths that led to nowhere.  Just off and then end.  You would get on a cement path, assuming it goes to the shed or something, and well, no,  it just ends in the middle of the woods somewhere.  Your family doesn't have any stories about an incinerator breaking, does it?  No.  No?  Nothing like that?  But, uh...  Is it true that Sarah Hughes, when you first met her, you tried to slip her the tongue when  you kissed her?  No.  No?  Okay.  No.  So maybe that was a customary thing. 
[00:22:00]  No.  Oh, right.  No, you're the one that found your cousins attractive.  I never found my cousins attractive.  One cousin.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  From you, of all people, Mr. Hand on a Man's Back as he fellates you.  My being a gentleman has nothing to do with this.  Can I finish my rock story that that guy brought up?  Sure.  So we had to build all these walls, and we had a station wagon back then. 
[00:22:30]  We were really little.  And my dad would...  The family truckster?  Yeah, he would load us up in our little station wagon, and he would find all the  these hills all over Long Island, you know, on the North Shore there.  And you'd cement them.  He would pull off to the side of the road and go, all right, kids, go get some rocks and  have some fun.  Have some fun.  He'd make you collect rocks.  So he'd run up the hill.  Were there a size of rocks you had?  You know, like this size.  Like about the size of a basketball.  Yeah, like a basketball.  Those are big rocks. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, maybe even half the size of a basketball were the perfect size.  And we'd kind of roll them and throw them down the hill, load up the wagon, and bring  them back to our house for more cement work.  And what would you do with these rock...  Made walls out of them?  Is that what you'd do?  We made the cement.  My dad made the walls.  And he would put some cement down, and then put the rocks on it, more cement, and more  rock.  Well, then he'd have a pile of rocks, and he would figure out which rock went with the  one that's right next to it on the wall.  And build a big stone wall.  Big stone wall.  Ah, right.  And that was your childhood. 
[00:23:30]  That was a big part of our childhood.  Holy Jesus.  Jesus.  My younger brothers will tell you that.  They're convinced that our...  We didn't have bedrooms.  We had barracks.  Barracks.  You could probably file some kind of a suit if that would make you feel better.  We had barracks.  All right.  Time to cement.  And then you would have to take your school lunch to school with you with the bag.  Well, see, yeah.  That's where the story connects with the other story. 
[00:24:00]  You guys think I'm effing with you, but we did bring our sandwiches to school in cement  bags, because we had so many of them laying around.  So instead of a lunch bag, you'd have this big rolled up...  Well, some days we were lucky.  We got the big, oversized King Cullen...  The shopping bag, yeah.  Yeah.  The one where you put all your groceries in.  The supermarket bag.  Not the small ones that they made for sandwiches.  That was always...  You'd have this big, rolled up bag in your hand.  And the apple would roll...  Back and forth. 
[00:24:30]  Back and forth.  Nice and bruised.  Bang up your sandwich.  It would land on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich made from Pepperidge Farm Bread.  Oh, I hated that.  I think that's a Long Island reference.  Pepperidge Farm Bread is the thinnest bread you can get in America.  And it stinks.  It always seems stale.  And the jelly would just seep right through the damn thing.  So you're trying to enjoy your peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  And you're having peanut butter and jelly, which is pathetic enough.  And your fingers would get all sticky, because you couldn't even hold the bread right.  And then you'd eat your bruised apple. 
[00:25:00]  What kind of beverage?  All the rich kids I went to school with had their snack packs with their cute little cheese and crackers.  And then they had their little pudding that they would open up.  A little pop-top pudding.  They would place it all nice.  And you'd have your cement bag full of peanut butter and jelly and a bruised apple.  A bruised apple.  And what kind of beverage were you enjoying?  Powdered milk.  Powdered milk?  Powdered milk.  What is that?  I don't even think we got milk money. 
[00:25:30]  All the other kids would get that nice whole milk, and they'd sit in front of them.  Did you have to put powder in a cup and fill it with water?  Dude, we drank powdered milk all the time.  Are you kidding me?  Powdered milk is disgusting.  And we finally complained enough where they would mix it half and half for us.  Do you realize Centerport, where you're talking about, is a pretty well-to-do neighborhood?  Yeah, we did all right.  We did all right, but we had a lot of kids and stuff.  And then they would take kids off the street. 
[00:26:00]  Right, the girl that disappeared that used to live in the attic.  She disappeared one day.  Right, right, right.  No, her boyfriend lived in the attic.  Oh, that's right.  And my dad almost shot him.  If he had a gun, he would have shot him.  Is that Jason Williams?  Jason Williams.  No, we thought there was like a burglar in the house.  Really?  But it was one of my older sister.  Well, you call her the older sister, but...  Well, I had a real older sister and then my older sister's friend.  So it was one of their boyfriends that got kicked out of their house for smoking dope at like 15. 
[00:26:30]  So now the kid is living in our attic.  Right.  And my sister would run food up to the attic.  And he was there for a while.  And we started hearing noises and we thought either the house was haunted or someone was like hiding up there.  You know, like a burglar or something.  Yeah.  He was as much a son as you and Mike.  I'm sorry.  So where were we?  I don't know, but I know where we are now.  In a big, uncomfortable, chilly bubble of Olby's upbringing. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah, my aunt...  Yeah, but you say that like there are some women who aren't.  Oh, God.  Rich kids who had their thermoses got their asses kicked, says Kevin.  From the Upper East Side.  Why?  Were you getting your ass kicked?  Thermos.  I never had a thermos.  I never had a lunch box.  I usually bought lunch.  And then for a time, because my mother was a single mom, we were on that free lunch program. 
[00:27:30]  But it was in the days where it wasn't inconspicuous.  You had to pull out the free lunch card, which is like the scarlet letter of pauperdom.  And you'd pull it out, and it was like, oh, you'd hear groans from behind it.  Oh, oh, come up with the goddamn 65 cents.  See, it wasn't that bad for us, thank God.  Oh, no.  It sounds like a dream come true with you.  It wasn't that great.  See, Anthony, you're poor. 
[00:28:00]  And, yeah, I get my lunch that way.  Friday pizza day.  Was there anything worse, though, when you say to your friend, you buy in?  I always say in school, you buy in?  You buy in?  Yeah.  And you had to just say, hey, I never got lunch money.  And I wasn't poor either.  No.  It was just cheap.  Really?  Yeah, middle class people.  Two kids.  Just cheap.  Just cheap, so you had to deal with that.  All right, why don't we take our first break?  I can't match up to that story.  I'm just saying.  You know, there's a bunch of tourists out there taking pictures of Earl, of all people. 
[00:28:30]  Why are they taking pictures of Earl?  Why?  Have they never seen one before?  Oh, God.  We're from a neighborhood with no crime.  Can we have a photo next to you?  Could you make like you're taking my bag an action shot?  All right, Earl's coming in.  Earl.  There's got to be like, hey, what's going on out there, Earl?  Earl, you're like a celebrity out there.  What's going on?  Who is that?  She's introducing a client. 
[00:29:00]  How come they're...  Oh, yeah, all of them, yeah.  These are young men, young boys.  Oh, wait, wait.  You got them.  Earl, they wanted your picture?  I'm just going through the hall and they went, hey, this is Earl's dad.  What are they clients for?  Bye.  What the hell are they from?  They're kids.  They took a picture.  Stop it.  Do they all point at you and go, hey, look, Shrek.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Years of vitamin, oh, dear.  Woo!  Where's a Chicago clown when you need it? 
[00:29:30]  Second reference of the day.  It's John Wayne Gacy day.  And there should be one.  All right, why don't we take a break because we've got lots to do today.  Rodvin.  Definitely looking for ladies that call us up and impress us to get in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We only have five spots left.  Can we announce a prize yet?  What's going on?  This is why we suck.  Why can't we announce a prize?  We definitely have cash and they're working on the prize stuff.  Look at the other thing.  Oh, boy. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, boy.  We are minutes away from starting to crush skulls again around here.  Here's the problem.  We're getting along too well with management and the different little departmental insects that roam around this place.  And I think, I don't think that's a good thing.  Oh, but you're not to lunch with the bosses anymore.  How's he going to eat?  How's he going to eat? 
[00:30:30]  I don't mind you taking their money.  I've come a long way from those Pepperidge Farm peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  You should eat with him in public.  He's Pete picky.  Pete picky.  Remind me to tell you about, we've got to take a break, but I hung with Norton last night as he was doing his spots.  A lot of people don't know, Norton works his ass off on his routine at all these comedy clubs all over Manhattan  where he does a spot here, then jumps in his car, goes all the way downtown, does one here, then goes here.  And I got some observations. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  It was hilarious.  I saw the same act from Norton because he's working on new material.  That's what you do when you do these spots, right?  It's something boss knows nothing of, right?  I just sit home and do the same stuff.  I saw him in the span of 40 minutes bomb horrendously in one establishment and kill with the exact same material.  How did that work?  We've got to take a break, but we'll get into it next.  How's that, okay?  Sounds like the New York-Philly ratings.  And he was getting... 
[00:31:30]  You know what?  There's going to be all sorts of rumors.  I know.  We're doing fine in New York.  And the fact is, all the other shows that are on this station in New York would kill to have what we have right now as far as our ratings.  So we're doing fine, and I don't want anyone to tell you that differently.  We just wish that more people would swim back to our island.  I can't wait to hear where Norton tanked horribly.  And then he's yelling at the crowd.  Did you lose control for a little bit?  Really annoyed. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, you know what?  Next time I got to tape you.  Okay.  I got to tape you.  Wow, yeah, that would be cool.  Do they have a board there?  No, not aside from the people sitting there watching.  We'll get into that next.  There's a girl standing by.  She wants to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She can come down Monday.  She's from Cleveland, though.  All right.  Didn't we hear this before?  Yes, but let's not make judgments.  All right.  And where are the girls from New York, you twats?  Pfft, that'll get them, Opie.  Boy, the ho, me? 
[00:32:30]  Twat, I'll be right down.  Stop just assuming that we're just going to entertain you every day, New York.  Help us out.  You let us down with the goddamn Naughty Nighty contest.  Yeah.  No hot ladies showed up.  We need you for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  No ladies are showing up.  We're getting girls driving from Boston to Cleveland.  Quite frankly, we've had it.  Show us some love, ladies.  We bust our asses here, and you guys just, you know, you don't help us out anymore.  Come on, girls.  Where are you?  We're the girls from the New York area that are going to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We want New York girls down here. 
[00:33:00]  We're all the hot girls that should have been in the Naughty Nighty contest,  but decided to avoid us like the goddamn plague.  Where are you?  Things are going to start changing around here again.  Goddammit, we're going to start racking some head.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like it's back to me.  Sometimes you want to hear...  The Opian Anthony Show. 
[00:33:30]  And we're back with The Opian Anthony Show.  It's Friday, so let's act it.  I thought I would be sick of Disturb by now.  I still crank it every other day in my car, every night home when I'm leaving.  Rest assured, when I hit that FDR drive, I have this crank and get the hell out of my way. 
[00:34:00]  I defy you to take your foot off the gas pedal when this music's playing.  I swear to God, I'll pistol whip the next guy that says shenanigans.  Hey, Double LC, what's going on?  What's up?  I was calling to check up on you guys.  You said there's like three more spots to go,  and I wanted to make sure I still had mine because I've got everything I need to come out there on Monday.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  Now, first of all, it's five spots left in the 55-Gallon Jump Challenge.  You called us the other day from Cleveland, right?  Right on.  You're driving all day on Monday just to try out for the 55-Gallon Jump Challenge.  Definitely leaving out at 6 in the morning.  Okay.  And what are you going to do?  I'm going to do the headstand, which I can't do to save my life,  and I'm going to give myself some golden torture.  I think that's what I can call it.  A little discipline.  Oh, you're the, okay.  Yeah, the headstand with the old discipline thing.  Yep.  I can't wait to see that, finally.  Yeah.  And here you go.  Another example.  A girl's going to drive eight hours to help out the radio show. 
[00:35:00]  Eight hours.  What about the girl 20 minutes away?  Holy S.  Uh-huh.  Come on, New York.  Come on, New York girls.  Where are you?  Double LC, we will guarantee that if you come down here and do that,  you are in no matter what.  Okie doke.  Thank you.  Hell yeah.  Hey, I have a question, too.  You guys have the 6 o'clock queef,  but whatever happened to the 5 o'clock fake?  Yeah, we were trying to start up that fake-o thing again,  and I don't know.  We'll see what happens today. 
[00:35:30]  We're running out of hours to do things.  We only have four of them.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  You guys suck.  Norton, you rule.  Do you need to talk to anyone,  or are you just going to be here on Monday?  I'm probably just going to be there on Monday.  We're leaving out at 6 in the morning.  I'm going to come up with...  Does Rick have your address?  Because if you don't show up on Monday,  we're personally getting in a car,  and I'm going to go find you.  I've got you guys' address from the Internet,  the 888, that one.  Yeah, okay.  We will hunt you down.  All right, Rick's going to talk to you real fast,  but don't blow us off.  I'm not going to blow you off.  I wouldn't have called again. 
[00:36:00]  All right, cool.  Thanks, Double LC.  Later.  I think we have to give her gas money.  Oh, that's fine.  It's just fine.  Anthony, the winner of the 55-gallon drum challenge will win.  All right, come on.  What is it?  There may be a trip involved.  There may be that jet ski thing involved,  but this is...  This is the very least?  This is the very least, and this is a definite.  Okay, there could be more prizes added later.  Yeah, well, this is very impressive.  Third place will win $500.  Just for being third. 
[00:36:30]  Second place will win $1,000.  $1,000 for second place.  And first place in the 55-gallon drum challenge...  First place.  ...will walk away with $2,000.  Two grand!  $2,000!  Holy crap!  All right, look at that.  There's your goddamn prize.  I can't wait to see the phones light up now.  Two grand for first place.  For third place, $500. 
[00:37:00]  For sitting in a goddamn barrel.  There you go.  Hey, we got a girl on hold from Seattle.  She's going to drive all weekend cross-country  to be part of our freaking show!  Now, show some gumption, girls.  But the girl from Hoboken is too busy  to help out the Opie and Anthony show.  Holy S.  Becky, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I want to beat up that girl who was whining yesterday.  What, Carrie?  Yeah.  I want to kick her in her face repeatedly.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You guys should invite her down  so we can all, like, gang beat her. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, Becky, from Brockton.  Yeah.  Brockton.  You were here.  You were 10 feet away from her for four hours.  Why didn't you take care of it when you were here?  I was going to steal her sunglasses.  But I felt bad.  Rick was on fire yesterday.  I felt bad for her because she was making...  I don't know.  She just made herself look so stupid.  I didn't want to make her look stupid.  Anytime you bring up an IQ in an argument, she goes,  because Rick goes, shut up, stupid.  And she goes, I have an IQ of 140.  I'm in Mensa.  It's like, what?  Did she say that? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And Rick goes, just shut up and put your face in the toilet.  140 is genius.  Yeah.  That girl was so stupid.  That girl was retarded.  You know what?  She was freaking wicked retarded.  Wicked retarded.  Becky, I got to call you out because we liked you.  We definitely liked you.  And you were cool for us yesterday.  But you're being all brave on the phone.  You had the chance to do all this in person yesterday.  I know.  Stephanie wanted to beat her up, too.  Stephanie was giving her wicked, dirty looks.  And I was just like...  Wicked, dirty.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's more than just dirty looks.  I did cut, though. 
[00:38:30]  Totally.  Yeah, but you're talking a lot of bunk now.  I know.  Invite her down to it.  I'll do something about it.  That's right.  I didn't realize how stupid she was until, like, in the car.  And I was just like, wait a minute.  Why didn't I hit her or something?  I love you in the SNL sketches with Jimmy Fallon, by the way.  Oh, I love that.  That's so funny.  Noma.  Noma.  Aren't those great?  Wicked Tessa.  Wicked Tessa.  Becky, you're in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  And we look forward to seeing you again, okay?  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  Godspeed.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[00:39:00]  See, that's a cool girl, man.  She was fun.  And not like that other one.  Right.  Rick sure showed her, though.  Yeah.  You know, we usually don't promote our weekend show here in New York.  Yeah.  But tomorrow, from 3 to 7, there's a good one.  There's a lot of interesting things that happened this week that will be replayed.  And one of them will be the fight that Rick had with that girl.  You're on cold medicine today, Rick?  No?  No, I'm back on my tired.  All right.  Hey, Jeff, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey. 
[00:39:30]  How you doing today?  Pretty good.  Norton, you suck.  Thank you, mister.  Hey, I just wanted to say, Stephanie's doing some work promoting her Naughty Naughty final  entry here.  How's that?  She's got her IM name up.  And if you IM her, you get a reply with a website that she's put up with some pictures.  Good for her.  Get out.  Really?  Hey, man.  Absolutely.  These girls that are in the finals of the Naughty Naughty contest, they can do whatever they  want to get votes.  Dude, absolutely.  God bless Washington, D.C., too, man.  Hey, man.  You want to see Stephanie naked, man? 
[00:40:00]  I've done the IM thing and send you to eatabullet.com.  And there's like, oh, you dick.  Look at you.  Jim, don't worry.  Tickets for Town Hall is selling.  All right, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Syndication underground.  Perry Panic over there.  Perry Panic.  I really am Pete Plug.  Yeah, come on.  We were going to talk about that.  I want to hear about Norton's gigs and Ira Insecure over there. 
[00:40:30]  Well, if it doesn't do it, I'm going to call my agent.  I'll be Teddy.  I told you so.  Well, you were Bobby Bomb last night.  Oh, it was horrendous.  Now, that's the oddest thing.  Town Hall, April 18th.  Ticket through Ticketmaster.  You will laugh your ass off.  By the way, you know, because we like to go off on tangents.  Did you know that you and I are presenting Dice at the Beacon? 
[00:41:00]  No, I didn't know that until I opened up the paper and saw that.  Look, we're good friends with Dice.  You know, he's a fun guy and everything like that.  We'll do anything for Dice.  And it's not against Dice.  I swear.  This guy's a good guy.  And the guys that help us out with this radio show.  But it's another example of people taking advantage of us.  Before we present something, I'd like the idea to be presented to us.  And how about you present some money to the advertising department here?  Right.  Hey, hey, enough with the sea sucker thing. 
[00:41:30]  Well, I was going to say, before you have us present something,  they should present money to the advertising department.  Right.  That's all I was trying to say.  I mean, I open up, if it says presented by Opie and Anthony,  I would think maybe we wouldn't, it would be best if we know that that's happening.  Do people understand what is going on with this radio station in New York  and other radio stations we're on across the country?  If we don't get good ratings, and if we don't get ad dollars, 
[00:42:00]  then you will not be here in the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  You'll be listening to like a light AC station.  Oh, yeah.  And these idiots are just assuming too much.  Of course we're going to sell out the dice shows at the Beacon.  Yeah.  But how about you spend just a couple bucks on our damn show to advertise it?  Right.  And how about you spend a couple bucks advertising that little Jimmy Norton over there  is going to be performing in New York?  Little Jimmy Norton. 
[00:42:30]  Come on.  Presented.  What is with the giggling going on in here?  Oh, who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  That's what it looks like.  Look at Earl.  He's just sitting there.  Hello.  What is he doing in that room?  Look at him.  Hello.  What do you see on his teeth?  I didn't even know someone was looking at us through the other studio until he smiled.  Kind of look like the beginning of Scooby-Doo over there.  All he saw was eyes and teeth.  Oh, God. 
[00:43:00]  That might qualify for my line of the day.  I better be careful.  All right, so, Anthony, last night, and I know they ran one Q commercial for Dice,  but, you know, you could do a little better than that.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone, and then, and then we, and, but, but we says we were going to present it.  What happened with Jimmy Norton?  Well, so Jimmy did his spots last night.  You know, it's really interesting to hang out with some of these, you know, guys, New 
[00:43:30]  York comedians, you know, when they do their day-to-day thing, which is going from club  to club, working on new material, you know?  And then, and that's how you figure out what's going to work and what's not, you know?  You just don't just go on the stage and assume this joke's going to kill you.  You work it out.  Because I got to go back to, not to interrupt you, I got to go back to Philly the 28th.  So, and I'm not plugging, the shows are sold, and thank you, Philly.  But, I mean, some people are going to be coming back from the old shows, and I'm not going  to be able to write a whole new hour, but I want to have a new, at least 15 minutes in  there somewhere. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, why bother?  Why bother?  They'll still come.  They'll show up.  You know what I mean?  He was doing that dryer door thing for years.  So, I'm trying to work for, like, the last few weeks going from clubs, just trying to  work on this new 20, 25 minute.  Right.  And then, you know, it won't all be funny.  I'll take out 10 or 12 and then use 14, 15 of it.  Something I don't think Jim wants.  A lot of people know.  He works his ass off on his act.  And what happened?  You and I can learn from him.  So, we go to Dangerfield's last night on the east side. 
[00:44:30]  And, God, man, that place was, I got to say it.  I know it's a legendary club.  That was the place where, like, Sam Kinison made his mark.  Sam Dice, Roseanne, Seinfeld.  We've all seen those HBO specials, right?  Yeah.  With Kinison and all that, they were all filmed at Dangerfield.  Hey, Dangerfield.  And they got all the pictures of every comedian that has ever been on a stage, basically,  at this place.  I crap myself and I don't even know it.  They got pictures of Johnny Carson.  Sitting there on the east side show in New York.  They haven't changed the decor in this place since it opened, I think. 
[00:45:00]  Nope.  And how long has it been there?  I believe it's the second oldest club in the country after Pips in Brooklyn.  It's 69.  All the improv in New York.  Well, last night, I don't know how he does it.  It felt like a funeral home.  I'm just saying last night.  I don't know what the place is like on the weekends when there's a lot of people there.  But it's just a regular Thursday night.  There's no real advertising, so you don't even know who's going to be there.  You know, if there's like a headline or if they say out front, you know, Jim Norton's  going to be there, you know, you're going to get a lot of people. 
[00:45:30]  But no one knows any of that.  So you're just getting the people that are, you know, feeling a little bit silly and want  to laugh a little bit.  So they just walk in after, you know, after dinner.  A lot of tourists.  A lot of tourists.  Uh-oh.  The room is set up.  You can't even tell how many people are in there because it's so dark with these tiny little  lamps on each table.  I swear to God, I felt like I was walking into a wake.  It was really creepy.  Then you realize you were.  Yeah.  Oh.  There were only two people working there, like the bartender who was really nice and that  guy who's been there forever. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  He's been there for 32 years, he's telling us.  Cario, yeah.  And then Jim waits to do his 15 minutes and try out his new material.  So it comes time for Jim to get on stage.  And on the way over, you know how he does that Pete Polite and all that?  It's very silly stuff that you said that Florentine does.  Your roommate, right?  Which is why I don't do it in my act because it's something you do when you're a kid.  I remember hearing when you're too pumped Pete and all this stuff.  But the only person I heard say it in adulthood was Florentine.  And he always makes me laugh when I'm like, I can never do that on stage because it's like 
[00:46:30]  a thing that reminds me of him.  So it's almost like, eh, let him do that.  It's Jimmy's thing.  All right.  And then you can relate to this when you know the comedian's on stage and it's like  a slow night.  You know, other comedians will heckle their friend as he's trying to do his stuff on stage.  Or like Jim Norton or somebody else, they'll say something that's only funny to you.  Yeah.  Something like, Jim, you got to do me a favor and just throw in Pete Polite and that type  of thing into your act.  You know, because it'll just be silly and stupid.  So he goes, I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to do that. 
[00:47:00]  So he's on stage doing some of the material that we've all seen where it just goes over  so well, killing people, can't breathe, they're laughing so hard.  He is not getting one laugh last night.  Not even the polite, like, you know what I mean?  Nothing.  He starts getting pissed off at the audience and starts yelling at them where it was really  uncomfortable to sit there.  You were like, I really don't like you people.  I really hate you. 
[00:47:30]  Right?  At least that would have been nice.  I would have heard something.  And then I could tell he's like, okay, well, you know, maybe that was some new material.  Maybe, all right, let me go for a line I just know.  Knows, kills.  And he does the line and there's still nothing.  He turns to the audience and he goes, nothing?  Nothing?  Uh-oh.  So he's yelling.  Lost control, did you?  And parading the audience a little bit.  Yeah, because I don't, I just knew that something should have been, I knew I was offending  them on a certain level and that's what annoyed me.  Not that, oh, they're not laughing. 
[00:48:00]  But when I know that they're pulling back because they don't appreciate the content,  I'm like, all right.  Not their brand of humor, maybe.  Exactly.  You didn't do this joke.  You know what, dude?  Had I thought of that, you can bet your bottom dollar as they say in prison, I would have  done it.  Yeah.  Because then you don't want to violate them and go down on your own terms.  If you're going to bomb, you're going to do it on your terms.  Right.  I give him a lot of credit because if I was in that situation, I would have tried to figure  out a way to get off that stage immediately. 
[00:48:30]  He decided to suffer through it.  There's no escape.  You can't leave.  Oh, there's something he could probably do.  You cannot leave.  There's no ejection seat.  You could just go, oh, my time is done.  After what?  A couple of minutes?  I had to do a half hour.  He had to do a half hour.  Oh, my God.  After 10 or 15 minutes, he still had another 15.  So you know you're just sucking.  So then he starts doing the whole, every other joke ended with like a Pete Polite or  what was the one that the...  I was, because I started doing, I'm like, so you noticed I was pausing.  I'm like, how can I really annoy them?  So I did like 10 Andrea Yates jokes about the blub blub in the tub and how funny it 
[00:49:00]  was.  And they're all like, and they're all going, oh, just groaning.  So you must have enjoyed that on a personal level.  They hated me.  And then one lady really wanted to heckle him, but she was too scared.  She was afraid.  Good for her because she'd have been the...  And so he points it out and he goes, I don't like you and you don't like me.  She was some yuppie C from like DC or whatever.  But he's like, it's okay because we know it.  We know we just don't like each other.  And she was like nodding her head or something.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:49:30]  So then he starts doing it with that Pete Polite and stuff.  Andrea Yates was Jenny Genocide.  Yeah.  Or Julie Genocide.  She's a regular Julie Genocide, isn't she?  So afterwards, I'm like, dude, that's a J and a G.  Because the whole joke is that...  Oh, it doesn't matter as long as it's got the same sound.  I know.  So then he's trying...  Don't be Ned Nitpicker.  He's trying his heart out.  And then it is dead silent.  And now you hear the phone ringing from the bar.  Loud as...  It could be like the phone is on stage with him. 
[00:50:00]  And Jimmy turns without missing a beat.  And he goes, I hope they're not calling in a bomb threat because it's too late.  That didn't even get a laugh.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I hope that whole crowd somehow develops stomach cancer and then gets killed by that Popovich dude.  I love him.  Guy driving down 7th Avenue.  Eddie Trunk wants in real fast.  Eddie.  What's up, Trunk?  Apparently, that goes on stage with a lot.  Do you guys know the Dice album, The Day the Laughter Died? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, they taped that there, right?  Yeah, and Dice ends up on the show.  Aw, damn it.  Your phone sucks.  Eddie, you stink.  I want a picture of Piazza.  He's gone.  Mark, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, Norton, Valentine's Day at the Comedy Cellar.  Goes out there.  The guy Godfrey comes out first.  Tells a funny joke.  Everyone's dying, laughing.  Norton comes out.  The first thing he says is a joke that he just told.  Lost the crowd from there.  What?  What do you mean?  The night Godfrey was there. 
[00:51:00]  Remember he was telling the jokes?  And the joke he came out with was about the plane and the hijacker and the pilot with the axe.  Right through the head.  Everybody's dying, laughing.  It's great.  Then he calls out Norton.  First joke you tell is the one with the pilot with the axe of the dome.  I didn't know he had.  What happened?  Oh, that hurt.  I lost him there.  And I told my girlfriend, this guy's hysterical, blah, blah, blah.  And I understood him because, you know, I know Norton's humor, but the crowd was lost.  Yeah.  They're all dead, too, on their dates.  Scumbags.  The only chocolate I think is great.  You know the chocolate that Hitler and Eva Braun ate? 
[00:51:30]  That's what I hope they all had, their little heart boxes.  But what happens sometimes with a cyanide, whenever you get topical material, you're going  to have 14 comics all going to hit on it.  And that's the way that's understandable.  Right.  So then, just to wrap this up real fast, so then, you know, his next spot is at the  Comedy Cellar down in the village.  A great, great place, by the way.  Yeah.  Man, he takes care of his comedians.  The place is awesome.  Well run.  Always mobbed.  Always mobbed and a lot of fun.  Like I said, I can't say much about Dangerfields because everyone saw it the one night. 
[00:52:00]  That was the first time I've ever been there.  I love working out there.  It was definitely a slow night.  But the cellars always happen.  Very hip join.  And you get to see a lot of funny guys on any given night.  Any given night.  I've washed the trees, collars.  Yeah, a lot of the guys that have been on our show, matter of fact.  And they're all down there almost weekly working on new stuff and things like that.  So then Jim goes there, does the exact same act he just, I just saw a half hour earlier  at Dangerfields, freaking kills.  Kills.  Kills. 
[00:52:30]  That's the strangest goddamn thing.  I don't get it.  It is.  It's because they're tourists.  It's a weird.  Tourists.  It's a weird vibe thing, too, you know, if you're not getting that energy from the audience,  I guess.  Yeah, it is.  It's like you go to the cellar, you're going to get people that live around the area, like  popping in.  Is that it?  Much more walking than it.  Yeah.  It's McDougal Street, man.  It's all people walking down the street.  Yeah.  And then we're out on the sidewalk and I guess people are leaving the cellar and they're all  like, dude.  And they're just coming up to him like crazy.  And I'm like, this is so weird.  I'm trying to go, thank you, April 18. 
[00:53:00]  Thank you, April 18.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  This is Mike from Bayonne.  About three weeks ago, a month ago, number one, Colin Quinn is the killer.  If you come on after that guy, he's the most non-funny man on earth.  Dude, dude, dude.  Oh, Colin's funny.  I'm going to be honest with you.  Colin is unbelievable.  He bombs every time.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I would love to watch my friends bomb.  And I'm not being polite because I know Colin.  He is my favorite comic to watch.  And I'm not being polite.  Dude, he's brilliant.  I really do love Colin.  You also like that broad-on E, too, so that's not saying much for you. 
[00:53:30]  Dude, every comic loves a guy.  I'm not busting a lot of people.  But anyway, it was the best.  He just doesn't make you laugh.  That's all.  It was like on a Wednesday night.  And Norton happened to be there.  Me and my buddy there were putting a road on.  And it's not that you bomb.  It's the audience bomb.  When there's not a lot of people in there, then it's, you know, and you follow Colin Quinn.  Sorry, again, it just wasn't funny.  And he starts grabbing his fat on his stomach, and he makes these faces like he's ready  to blow up the freaking place.  You have to, you got to see him when he, he's just pissed at the audience. 
[00:54:00]  It's really funny when you get pissed off.  Oh, and he starts grabbing his stomach, and he rubs his head, and he puts that face on.  It's hysterical.  Anyway, I love you guys.  Peace out.  All right.  But I got to take issue with that.  I mean, Colin, don't make him laugh.  That's fine.  But I mean, he's literally one of the only comics I would pay to, Colin.  Yeah, Colin's funny.  Brilliant, man.  He's the best comic in the city.  How can anybody not laugh watching him?  Well, you know, it's not the guy's cup of tea.  That's all that's about.  It's not his brand of humor.  That's what it is.  It's a brand of humor. 
[00:54:30]  I'm not knocking the guy for not digging.  I just can't comprehend that.  Some people like Disturbed, other people like NSYNC.  You know what I'm saying?  Oof.  Just can't figure it out.  Stan, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey, Jimmy, it's Stan the man.  How are you, bro?  Hey, what's up, man?  I was just calling.  Remember that club you did for me in that little town with Dan Wilson?  And the audience sucked so bad, you faced the wall and did 20 minutes facing the wall?  Oh, yeah.  I turned around and I faced it.  That was the best, bro.  This is my friend, Stan, who used to do comedy with me years ago.  And, like, he booked a gig one time and I was bombing so bad, I just turned around and 
[00:55:00]  faced the wall away from him with my back to the audience.  Yeah, Norton, you weren't bombing at all.  That was the last night for that club because that place was a hole in the wall, too.  Yeah, well, they hated my guts.  All right.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah, well, you rule anyway, bro.  Thank you, Stan.  Thanks, Stan.  Good talking to you, buddy.  Take care, man.  All right.  Albert from D.C., what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, man, we're loving your show down here.  Dude, I just looked at Norton on that freaking website last night.  He looked like a little lesbian dyke female with that little bald head. 
[00:55:30]  He looked like a little, you know those bull dykes, man?  Dude, I know.  Jeez, man.  Rub it in.  I know.  You think I don't walk by mirrors and wish I had a hammer?  I know.  Hey, what happened to you, man?  I mean, where's your hair at, bro?  It says on the screen, though, he looks like a fat lesbian.  I mean, he does.  You're not even fat.  You're just soft.  There's something about me.  I look meaty.  Hey, I printed off a picture and put it on the wall, dude. 
[00:56:00]  Whenever I'm feeling down, I look at Norton and laugh.  Right on, Albert.  Hey, man.  Hey, one more question.  Yeah, go ahead.  Would it be possible for me to, like, grease Norton down and see if I can catch him?  You're a horrid man.  All right.  That really bugs me because I'm considering it.  Sounds like fun.  Sounds like a fun night, two men.  Check into a hotel.  You oil each other up.  You play catch me if you can.  Chase each other around. 
[00:56:30]  Play a little grab ass first.  You hold me tight until I pop out.  All right.  Kevin Meaney on the way.  Rich Voss.  Let's do an F.U. line here.  And we'll be back with the Anthony show, okay?  It's going pretty well today, huh?  Is that guy still out there with the pictures?  Yeah.  Wow.  We could describe that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not pretty.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the O.P. Anthony F.U. line. 
[00:57:00]  I would like to say F.U. to the girl who thinks that burning her tongue with a match in a pool of water  is something when it's nothing.  And I am not fat and a Twinkie eater and a slut.  You must be thinking of your mom.  So go ask yourself.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F.U. out to Frenchie.  You've already burned yourself out, you French homo.  Or you can ever call people a douchebag.  Well, I got news for you, F.U.  You're the only f***ing douchebag on the show. 
[00:57:30]  Go back to your country, you freaking tool.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to throw out a big F.U. to all Yankee fans, any of those front-running, bandwagon,  son-of-a-bitch F.U.  who prevented me on the day that Met tickets went on sale to getting the Yankee-run tickets  at Shea Stadium so that I could take my mother, the biggest Met fan in the world,  as my birthday present to her, to a Yankees at Mets game.  Hey, you want to be Yankee fans?  You want to be fans of New York teams, that's fine, because you're your own f***ing team  and your own f***ing stadium.  You got me?  Then watch out this season. 
[00:58:00]  We're coming for you.  You ain't going to be so hot this year, all right?  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Make it touch her.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:58:30]  What do you think of those photos, Dan?  Very disturbing, man.  You know the story that happened the other day?  That guy that bit his girlfriend's face off?  He started chewing and swallowing meat that he ripped from her face.  Ugh.  And I thought the paper was exaggerating because they said the guy was swallowing chunks of  flesh.  Of flesh from the girl's face. 
[00:59:00]  Not a piece of flesh.  Chunks.  Not a nibble.  Not a nibble.  Well, some guy called us up and said he has pictures of it.  So he came down today.  Let it be noted.  Guy saying he has something for the show.  He showed up.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  See?  Stupid minds.  You're stupid, stupid minds.  Come on, chicks.  Guys, I got something that will help the radio show.  I'll be down on Friday.  Okay.  We didn't even have to question him.  We didn't even take his number.  We didn't have to check up on him.  He just showed. 
[00:59:30]  And these pictures are insane.  Really heinous.  There's one shot of the, I guess the left side of her head where the part of her face  right next to her eye, you know that thin flesh you got?  You got pinched right there next to your eye.  Pinched.  And right around the end of your eyebrow and your upper cheekbone area.  Ripped out with teeth marks.  You can see it.  It looks like something from American Werewolf in London.  Like they just ripped it out where you could see.  Here's the sick part. 
[01:00:00]  You could see her eyeball because the meat that usually keeps you from seeing it is ripped  away.  So you could see the side of her eyeball.  And that wasn't the only part of the face.  No, no.  A piece of her forehead ripped right out.  And then the whole other side was all messed up.  Yeah.  A piece of her cheek and then her ear just ripped her ear off.  And the guy brought him down.  It's like, geez.  And I hate looking at those things.  Like when people send me those pictures, I don't even look at them.  I'm more of a pornography guy myself, quite frankly. 
[01:00:30]  I like the sexual pictures.  Right there, Norton?  Sure.  I thought those were.  Oh, Jim, you're finally done with lunch.  Nasty.  It's an hour and 20 minutes into the show and Jimmy's had lunch.  Did we interrupt lunchtime?  I said a little bagel.  Hey, what's up, John?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  How's it going?  All right.  Norton, you could at least, like, you know, not eat in the middle of the last break.  Could hear you chewing over the whole radio. 
[01:01:00]  I'm sorry, man.  A lot of people are sending in some feedback about that.  I didn't mind.  I'm a pig just shoving.  That's good, too, when you're getting fat because you quit smoking to start eating more  carbohydrates.  That's really, that was brilliant of me.  Bread, butter, little fat pig, selfish fool.  At least you're doing show prep now, though.  Self-aiding.  Well, let's ask him.  Jim, you doing a show prep for today's show?  Yes.  You bringing anything to the table today?  I had some newspapers here.  I was going over some stuff. 
[01:01:30]  You have nothing.  Some interesting anecdotes?  Yeah, chatting with my agent, getting the same count I got two days ago.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we hear from people that come in during commercials when Norton's outside and go,  oh, my God, he's just unloading on the phone.  What goes on during the commercials?  You leave, you call people, you yell and scream at them?  No, I don't yell and scream at them.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I'm not that big.  What shows have in proms?  None of them.  I'm just cranky, dude.  I don't handle pressure at all. 
[01:02:00]  I've got to move into New York and nothing.  I know I need a business manager.  Everything I do, I just don't handle pressure.  I really don't.  I self-destruct and I hide with prostitutes and pornography.  That's why I honestly do that.  When I have to make calls, I will put my computer on.  A little fat breast just hiding in pornography.  That's what it is, too.  I run away from everything.  Instead of dealing with reality.  Yeah.  You use it as like, I don't know, something to cover up the responsibility. 
[01:02:30]  Of course, that's all it is.  Yeah, I would hide that.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Looking at the monitor, just jacking.  Yeah, yeah, because everything else is blocked out then when you're doing that.  Right.  I understand how people get to be very heavy because you continually eat, you know.  Oh, hide that.  Stuff that.  Stuff that.  Eat, eat, eat.  That's what it's like with those.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  So why are you eating so much lately?  Well, it's just one more thing because I can't whack my bag and put that in my mouth 
[01:03:00]  at the same time, or I'm certain I would.  A little lonely nothing with thin lips and an oral fixation.  That's exactly what it is.  A little thin bird vag lips and a stupid oral fixation.  Bird vag.  God damn, man.  That is bordering on sad.  It's true.  It's accurate.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, Norton?  I got the best way you can get a laugh.  I guarantee you.  Guarantee you it'll work.  What?  Take your shirt off.  No, I can't do that.  Oh, stop it. 
[01:03:30]  I don't do any type of physical props.  Were you bombing like Tom Hanks in that movie?  Someone help me.  Help me.  Punchline?  No.  What was the name of that movie with Sally Fields, right?  Yeah, Punchline, and it stunk.  Take it easy.  Apoosa!  People, they never capture comedians accurately in TV.  You can't act as a comedian.  That's one thing they cannot do.  You can't get the best act.  De Niro, even as Rupert Pupkin.  Was the best ever.  Was the best ever.  And even that, as he's doing his stand-up, it was more like Rupert Pupkin doing his stand-up. 
[01:04:00]  Maybe it was supposed to be Rupert Pupkin doing the stand-up.  Maybe.  I think it was all in his mind.  Oh, real?  You don't even think he was ever doing his stand-up?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's such a great movie.  Every time I see it, every time I see that movie, I think something different.  I don't know anymore.  Do you think he, uh, it's a great movie if you get a chance, rent it.  King of comedy.  It's like they make, they make comedians look like a bunch of melodramatic schmucks.  Like the only reason they're out there is to cover up for some big problems they have. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  Which is right.  Norton.  Exactly.  But it's like, we're not all melodrama.  You know, I never broke down and cried.  I, you know, shut up.  No comic does that.  No?  No.  Just breaks down and cries?  Maybe in the privacy of your own home when you're pinching your meaty breasts and Florentine's asleep.  Maybe you do.  Maybe.  Right.  You're not on stage in the middle of a contest that unfunny Sally Field is winning.  That housewife C. 
[01:05:00]  Women aren't funny in general.  And some dumb housewife who's married to John Goodman's going to win.  They always make comics look stupid.  I never saw that movie.  Always.  What happened?  Tom Hanks broke down and cried?  Yeah, yeah.  He was the big comic and the contest wasn't going well and he had some painful memory or some crap.  Oh, so he's supposed to be like the favorite.  He was the big funny guy.  He was Michelle Kwan.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he was Michelle Kwan.  Excellent analogy.  He was the snippy zipper.  That's exactly who he was.  And he fell.  He tumbled.  He tumbled. 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to have to rent that one, I guess.  Yeah.  Kwan is now going to be the Zamboni, Anthony.  Oh, with her ass.  Well, not even the ass with those big nostrils.  Oh.  Be able to clear up the ice nice for the rest of the skaters.  Yeah.  Ah.  You know, you've got to call me out on something, Jim.  Why?  So I'm at Dangerfields with Jim and a couple other comedians around.  Yeah.  And I was trying to show off there, Ant.  What were you doing?  Well, I, uh...  Someone mentioned, uh, out of nowhere, Buddy Hackett. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Dude, you've got to tell him what happened.  It was so awkward.  It was so great.  I just realized I'm not the only goose egg in the world.  It's always nice when one zero has the company of another.  He's like, yeah, I know, Buddy.  We talk.  Yeah, so I'm like, so someone mentions Buddy Hackett, and I'm like, oh, yeah, Buddy, I'm exaggerating.  Yeah, I talk to him all the time.  Jay Moore gave me his home number a long time ago.  I call him from time to time.  And I never told you, even.  So I go, yeah, let's call him right now.  I'm with Jim, a couple other comedians looking out. 
[01:06:30]  I'm like, wow, you're that close to Buddy Hackett.  He's going to call Hackett.  Hackett's a legend.  He's a legend.  So I get Buddy on the phone, and after he says, who is this, three times, and I'm trying to explain in front of everyone who I am.  And I know that it's not going well, because I hear him go, yeah,  it's Opie.  You've done my radio show?  Oh, no.  And then another silence, and then Jay Moore gave me your number?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Dude, you've got to call first and say, you know, from the bathroom and go, Buddy, I'm going to call you. 
[01:07:00]  And then kind of straighten it out.  Dude, you tried to show off.  That is so lame.  How is this story coming up?  This is the best story.  I know.  So then.  Oh, my God.  You screwed up.  Showing off.  Yeah, I'm sitting at the bar.  I'm, like, bragging.  And, like, yeah, Jim, here's that side of the conversation.  I'm trying to pull it out.  Buddy Hackett.  My buddy.  Yeah, I just want to say hi, you know.  Legend.  All of a sudden, he goes, who's this? 
[01:07:30]  He said this three times.  Who's this?  Who's this?  I don't know you.  And then he goes, I ain't talking right now.  And hangs up.  So now I got the phone in my ear, and everyone's looking at me like, who, who, who, is he going  to pass the phone around so we can all get to say hi to Buddy Hackett, the legend?  Give some respect to the legend.  So I had to take the phone down and casually go, um, well, Buddy, he doesn't want to talk  right now.  Oh, no.  And they heard you explain it, though. 
[01:08:00]  And everyone just kind of, kind of walked away.  You know, I was sitting there by myself at the bar feeling like a complete idiot.  What was more uncomfortable, that moment or when I got blown off by Dennis Leary up in  Boston?  That was pretty hilarious, too.  That was pretty uncomfortable because this happened in full view of everybody.  It was just when Adam started working on the job.  And I'm good friends with that.  Thank you for showing me your meaty belly there, Norton.  I'm, of course, very good friends with Adam Ferrara.  And we're up in Boston for the Comics Come Home thing. 
[01:08:30]  And Dennis Leary's hanging out at the bar talking with some press and stuff about the  TV show.  So Adam goes, hey, give me a minute.  I'll introduce you to Dennis.  I'm like, all right.  That's cool.  You know?  So Adam had to go away to do a little press.  And Dennis Leary gets done with the press he's doing.  So I figure, now's my chance.  I don't need Adam.  I'll just walk up to Dennis and say, hey, what's up?  I'm my Anthony Opie and Anthony show.  I'm friends with Adam.  Nice to meet you.  Enjoy the work.  Blah, blah, blah.  Whatever.  Just a little how you're doing. 
[01:09:00]  But you kind of told everyone you were going to go say hi.  Well, in a way, like there's a group of us.  So we're all like, oh, look at Andy.  He's going to go.  They're like, watch.  Right.  They're watching me approach.  And I'm thinking if it goes well, I'm going to join in on the conversation.  Exactly.  I'm opening the door for it.  You know, here's where I use my buddy Adam as like I'm going to be the guy, the big shot  that's going to introduce all you guys.  It's kind of like we were saying about a satellite there.  You were the satellite.  Let's see how it goes.  This is how big of losers we are.  So we watch Anthony walk over to Dennis.  I sauntered up.  Sauntered.  Opie. 
[01:09:30]  And Dennis Leary is standing at the bar.  I go, Dennis, Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  Good friends of Adam Ferrara.  Uh, very nice to me.  And I didn't even get like done with what I wanted to say.  He's like, yeah, yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  And walks away.  Yeah.  Great.  Anthony is by himself and now knows he has to turn around and face us.  He goes, yeah, great.  And it was one of those.  Yeah, great.  It's where he didn't even look at me like he looked as he's turning.  He looked over my head like, yeah, yeah.  Great.  Great.  It was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Great.  And I'm like, oh, my God, he didn't even look and he was off and gone.  So I'm standing at the bar now and I feel the eyes of everybody that I'm up there with  just looking at the back of my head like, I can't turn around.  And we're like, oh, oh, did that just happen?  And we all just like turned around.  And they try to be kind.  Like, as I turn around now to look at them, I see them turning around like, oh, they had  been looking at me the whole time.  I turn around.  They turned.  They didn't want to look at me.  Oh, that's not good.  They were ashamed.  That wasn't good. 
[01:10:30]  And embarrassed for me.  And I was all embarrassed.  That embarrassing feeling.  Your head, you feel like itches.  Your head itches.  It's all red and hot.  You feel like heat coming off of your face.  Your ears are burning and red.  And you're just embarrassed.  We got to call Buddy Hackett.  You want to call him?  Call him, buddy, right now.  And no one talk but you.  I want to hear you get him to where he knows who the hell you are at all.  I want to. 
[01:11:00]  Call him, buddy.  Go ahead.  We got to get the number.  This is good.  Dude, you're doing this.  I'm not saying a word.  No one else talks.  Opie's going to be floundering.  But that was horrible.  But then when Dennis Leary showed up here.  He was great.  And I confronted him with that.  He was just like, ah, yeah, I do that.  I'm an a-hole.  I was like, all right.  Well, I didn't.  They didn't try to make an excuse.  And now we're like pals.  We'll call him a little bit.  I got to find the number.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to get the number.  Yeah, right. 
[01:11:30]  It's not pre-programmed in your cell phone?  Oh, you don't have B Hackett in your auto dial?  How about the, why don't you just go through your cell phone now and look under our calls  outgoing because you didn't make ten more since last night.  I'm sure it's still in the old cell phone-a-rule.  Hey, good day.  Get the cell phone.  Look at you.  Being all smart.  Unless you tried to call Richard Pryor.  I would take it.  Any other comedy legends you try to call Opie?  Dude, I really want to call Pryor.  I don't know who, though. 
[01:12:00]  It was so uncomfortable.  Oh, it was great.  Let me yell at me.  His awful red face, blonde locks.  Oh, were you all red?  Yeah, he was.  That embarrassed feeling is the worst.  Yeah, yeah, well, the worst.  No, no, sir, 18 cities, click.  Oh, God.  Please, buddy, just talk to me.  Marianne.  You played it off or something.  Yeah.  I tried, but it was so, you saw the other side of it.  Dude, dude, come on.  Hello?  Ah, there's connection, there's connection.  Yeah, yeah, do something. 
[01:12:30]  I thought it was more fun to be uncomfortable.  I like being uncomfortable at times.  Now, buddy, I'm bringing a special girl over, too.  I think you're going to like her.  Yeah.  Marianne, what's going on?  Hi.  Opie's at Buddy's house with Sandy.  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Yes.  Yeah, what's up?  I'm Marianne.  I'm really sorry.  I'm calling to apologize for not coming out today.  What a doody.  You were the one from Cleveland?  Yes, I was the one from Cleveland, and I was going to come out and do the Cleveland  steamer. 
[01:13:00]  Marianne, you left up our whole show today.  You know what?  Hey, my daughter is sick.  There was nothing I could do.  How old's your daughter?  She is nine years old.  Leave her with an ant.  Everybody in my whole family needs friggin' work.  The show comes first.  A bunch of losers all work.  Would you come next week?  I told them I would come next Monday.  Not this Monday, but next Monday.  Oh, yeah.  That'll work.  Jeez.  I will.  I can come out next Monday.  I just need one.  And where's the priorities of that woman? 
[01:13:30]  Like, what's more important, taking care of the kid?  Right.  Prioritize.  Prioritize.  Oh, God, do I stink always.  He's got prioritize.  He first.  Prioritize.  Oh, oh, you working on it, Opie?  Sorry, sorry.  That's here.  No, no.  Just dial it, then.  Just dial it, Rick.  Bunch of asses in this room.  I know.  I know.  I'm like, do-do. 
[01:14:00]  We're sorry.  You're a call.  Do-do-do.  Oh, okay.  Opie's got the phone by his ear.  He's going to try.  Oh, where are you getting the one-handed conversation?  Until he lets us put him on the air.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  I want to hear him.  He's telling me he's on the air immediately?  Yeah.  Not with Ned Flanders down the hall.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  Old goody gumdrops.  All right.  Is it ringing?  Yeah, it's ringing.  All right.  You're supposed to say it's ringing.  I'm sorry. 
[01:14:30]  Help us out here, those of us who can't hear.  What?  What's going on?  Ah, answer machine.  Damn it.  Leave a message.  Nah.  We'll try again later.  Buddy.  It's Opie.  I called you last night and you hung up on me.  We're doing a radio show and we want to get you on the air.  Buddy.  Buddy.  We're going to call you back in about 20 minutes, so please answer the phone, okay?  We want to talk to you.  All right?  You blew me off last night.  I want to know why. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Bye.  Buddy Hackett.  Thank you.  You left a little message on Buddy's machine.  Dude, I really didn't like Opie's confidence during that call.  No.  Because last night when Buddy answered the phone, he was.  And I apologize, Florentine.  He was Timmy Tentative.  Was he?  No.  How was it?  Hi, Buddy.  Hi.  Oh, like he was surprised he answered?  Oh, Buddy?  Like hoping to get the old machine.  Right.  Like so he could leave that type of message.  Yeah, Buddy Ope again.  I don't know what happened last night.  Not only that, not only that, but he had Buddy the machine. 
[01:15:30]  You could have passed it around to all your friends.  You could have passed it around and said, see, there's his voice.  There's his voice right there.  But instead, he leaves that message like, hey, there's another big star to be reckoned with here.  Right.  All right.  Why don't we get Rich Voss into the studio next, okay?  Where's Voss?  He's outside.  And we'll say hi to him next.  Raunchy audio.  Look like a dog for me. 
[01:16:00]  Spankable video.  I got my thing in my hand here.  All the best parts of the Opie and Anthony show end up on BoundaryMusic.com.  And E.W.  Don't go crazy, you know.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:16:30]  Mary Ann's calling back from Cleveland.  Oh.  Mary Ann.  Yes.  Hey.  What's going on?  I just really wanted to call and apologize for not coming down today.  And I'll come down sometime.  I just can't make it today.  You're the one that wanted...  Oh, you called earlier.  You wanted to do the Cleveland steamer, but your nine-year-old kid was sick, so you couldn't make it, right?  Absolutely.  Can I ask you a question, ma'am?  How come you can't come, like, Tuesday or Wednesday?  I work.  No, no, no.  I mean this coming Tuesday or Wednesday.  I work. 
[01:17:00]  It's two grand up for a first prize.  We got $1,000 for a second prize and $500 for a third prize.  That ain't, like, worth maybe taking a day off?  You know, it's not like I don't make good money at my job, too, you know?  Why are we still talking to Marianne?  Didn't we talk to you already?  I like it.  She got spunk.  Marianne, we talked to you already, right?  I just...  I'm looking for some excitement in my life, okay?  Ah, that's good.  So what would you like to do?  Um, I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  Come down some other time.  You are terrible.  Get your hand out of your pants.  Relax, Jim.  Women have been blowing us off.  But at least she called.  Because we're too nice.  She did call, though.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Well, sometimes you can't make something.  You're saying you're going to come down for the show?  You've got to come down.  I don't like the excuses.  I don't like the phoned-in excuses. 
[01:18:00]  No, no.  Because all the bad ones spoil it for the occasional ones that are actually telling the truth.  Right.  Like, how many times have you had...  I've had this about four times.  Where you're supposed to meet a girl.  And you're like, look, I'm working late.  Can you just get the abortion?  I'll give you half the money when it's over.  Well, things come up.  Half the money and a ride.  All right, I could do that.  Jim, and he doesn't show up.  Jim, a little tip from your friend.  Oop.  Can't have them all.  Got to let some of them go. 
[01:18:30]  You're right.  You're right.  Hey, I'm calling about that money you owe me.  And no one wanted to give them all the money.  So he couldn't pay for half the abortion.  Then why is he going to pick her up if she can't pay?  Jim thinks he has a chance with every single girl that is associated with this show.  You're wrong.  I know I have a chance with very few, if any of them.  But you work every single one of them.  It's that element of doubt that he latches onto and loves that it might happen.  For once, I would like to see you not work it.  But it comes to nothing.  What the hell is going on? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, just shove her in the trunk.  Shove her in the trunk.  Ernie.  Oh, hey, what's going on?  Hey, shut up.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to thank Oprah real quick for that, you know, that Bill Maher spot.  What?  Nothing.  I enjoyed the show very much.  And I just thought I'd like to thank you for playing it.  Ernie.  Yes.  You've been listening to us a long time, right?  Yes.  Ixnay on the spot A.  Oh, okay. 
[01:19:30]  Sorry.  It's our new.  I mean, yeah.  All right.  So, yeah.  It's our new subliminal bit.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got to go return some videos.  I'll talk to the video.  Very funny.  So sit back and enjoy.  All back.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So you saw the Glutton Bowl last night?  Yeah.  I watched this thing.  It's pure Fox.  Pure Fox.  You got to love this network.  They'll just latch on to anything.  And they decided they were going to take a bunch of guys, make them eat a lot of disgusting 
[01:20:00]  stuff, and not go the distance.  I mean, you're going to do a contest like this.  How do people get eliminated?  They either back out and say, all right, I've had enough, or they pew.  Right.  Vomit.  Vomit.  Puking.  I don't care.  Always funny.  Always.  Always funny.  Even when it's disgusting, it still makes you laugh.  It's entertaining.  It's cringe.  You get all uncomfortable watching it.  And you could tell that a lot of these guys were puking. 
[01:20:30]  As a matter of fact, one of the things they had to eat were big heaping bowls full of mayonnaise, mayo.  And one guy ate eight pounds of mayo.  He was able to just shovel it in with this huge tablespoon, one after the other.  Other guys were just barely nibbling on the spoonful of mayo.  And after a while, you saw them start to heave.  And then they cut away and go, oh, this man's eliminated.  It's the good part, Fox. 
[01:21:00]  Why are they wussing out?  Fox has one ball.  One ball.  They're a little ballsy than the rest of the networks, but not quite two balls worth of balls.  But whoever owned the glutton bowl, you've got to go the distance.  Probably Fox said, look, we'll run it on our network, but we can't show puking.  Then you know what?  You take it somewhere else.  They had the buckets under the table, the whole thing.  We've done it here.  It's great.  It's the best part of any mass eating contest is the puking.  And they'll show cars in a race crashing into each other and people being pulled out dead. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  But they won't show a guy vomiting, stupid babies with awful programming.  It's like watching porno without the money shot.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, there you go.  Oh, come on.  It's the money shot.  Show them puking.  So then other things they had to meet.  If you could get away, I was never able to really get away from the point that they didn't go the distance.  So it sucked, if you ask me.  But some of the stuff they ate was pretty cool.  They had sticks of butter that they had to eat. 
[01:22:00]  They were just picking up sticks of butter.  And how many would they get down?  What was the record for the sticks of butter?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm not sure either.  Damn it.  I only caught the tail end of that one.  But the mayo was disgusting.  The hot dogs, this skinny little Asian guy was snapping the hot dogs in half, eating them,  and then he'd wet down the bun and eat it wet so he was able to get it down that way.  But that's kind of traditional.  That, the hamburgers, the eggs. 
[01:22:30]  I saw the eggs.  Yeah, the eggs, pretty sick.  And then I didn't want to watch anymore because they were getting ready to puke.  And like you said, they cut away.  I'm like, ah, this is garbage.  They had 15 feet of sushi for each contestant and whoever ate the most.  But they only ate like three and a half feet was the record.  Only?  Yeah, because I'm looking going, they don't need no 15 feet of sushi.  And then one foot that they didn't know where it was going to be,  but it was in the beginning of the sushi roll, was just wasabi.  So that's when the black guy just started heaving and I thought he was going to puke. 
[01:23:00]  Then they had the mystery contest where they didn't know what it was until right after they dumped it out of this big thing.  It's very stupid and trying to be dramatic.  But they found out it was cow balls were the one, the Rocky Mountain oysters, and then cow brains.  And they just dumped a huge pile of brains and this Asian guy won that too, just shoving them in his face.  And again, the other guys were ready to puke and they would just, they wouldn't show it.  That's the money shot of an eating contest. 
[01:23:30]  Of course.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, I was hoping you guys seen that.  We kept rewinding that fat bitch eating the sushi over and over.  Did you see her heave?  Oh, God.  It was so disgusting.  But they weren't showing the heaving.  No, they show them like dry heaving a little.  Yeah, you know.  And gagging.  But they didn't show.  And she would like, gag, and then she'd put her hand up, close her mouth, and look down  and go like, oh, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  You know what?  That's like going home with blue balls.  Right. 
[01:24:00]  I want to see that fat.  You need a finish.  Didn't she look like one of those disgusting old women you see at a barstool of a local pub?  Oh, man.  She was all weathered.  And she's eating the sushi.  And all I could look at, the most disgusting thing, more disgusting than anything else on that  show, was looking at all the chunks of shrimp and vegetable on her hands as she's shoving  it in her mouth.  It was disgusting.  Don, what's going on?  The sticks of butter?  It was four and a half sticks of butter.  Four and a half?  It was disgusting.  Wow.  The mayo was the worst, though. 
[01:24:30]  You have to admit, the mayo was the worst.  The one guy didn't have a problem at all.  The one guy was eating the huge spoonfuls of mayo.  Not a problem.  All right.  It was bad.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Let's go to Lisa.  Lisa, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to know who's cleaning up all the puke in the audience from watching  the concessions.  What?  When they got to eating a tendon from those tongues, that was so nasty.  Oh, yeah.  They were eating a tongue.  And what was that, tendon?  Oh, yeah.  They were, like, snapping in the one guy's mouth.  It was so nasty.  Yeah, it was pretty sick. 
[01:25:00]  I just wish, like you said, they had the money shot.  That's too bad.  That's too bad.  All right.  Thank you, Lisa.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  How's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I was watching.  That was great last night.  You liked it, huh?  Oh, it was so disgusting.  Yeah.  Watching those guys eat that mayonnaise out of the bowl.  But listen, I know about the butter.  The guy ate seven sticks of butter.  Someone just called and said four and a half.  No, it was seven sticks of butter.  See if that's old buddy.  Whose phone is that?  Is that Obie's phone? 
[01:25:30]  Is that Buddy?  Is Buddy calling you back?  Hello?  Ken?  Hey, it's Ken.  Hey, Ken Stevens.  How are you?  Ken Stevens, our boss, is calling us up.  Ken?  What's up?  Ken?  Oh, I kind of hear it.  What was it?  What, what, what, what, what, what?  Is he going to fire us?  What, what, what, what, what?  What, what, what, what?  What, what, what, what?  Oh, really?  The big boss wants to say hi to us, Ant.  What?  The big boss.  The big one?  In the big office, you know, all the way to the top of the building. 
[01:26:00]  All the way at the top?  All the way to the top.  That one?  All the way.  Ken?  Obie, that's never been good.  You run the radio station here in New York, right?  And the two stations we're on in Washington and Philly, right?  Mm-hmm.  You realize what time it is?  Sometime during the show?  Good, good.  Good.  Sometime during the show? 
[01:26:30]  Good.  Very good, Ken.  I had to take this call live on our show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But we're only hearing Opi side, Tom.  Well, you're not.  Yeah, you're.  Because it's illegal.  We know to put people on the, on the airline back, Ken.  Unless we ask permission.  Highly illegal.  He goes, he goes, but I asked you to call me during the break.  Well, I haven't called you yet because we haven't. 
[01:27:00]  He's such a tool.  I don't know how he runs three states.  Is this, is this a good thing or a bad thing?  Oh, that's a good question.  Good meeting, bad meeting.  He says it's a good thing.  Good meeting.  Last time is a really bad thing, right, Ken?  Is Ken going to be there again?  Ken, will you be there holding our hand like last time?  No?  Oh, okay.  Oh, he might not be invited, Anthony.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, ask Ken if he's going to ask us if we wake up every morning and try to figure out a way to F him. 
[01:27:30]  Did you hear that, Ken?  You didn't want to hear that one.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's a good question.  It was just quoting something that was said at the last time we went to the top of the building.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, you remember that, of course.  How could you forget it?  Remember we were looking at the window and I swear there's a true story.  There was a building across the way as we're getting bitched at, I think it's safe to say.  We've discussed it on the air.  And the number of the building across the way had 666 on it.  It's 666.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were over there at what they call Black Rock. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  It's the big CBS corporate building.  So when...  Huh?  When?  Oh, look at you.  What a joke.  Very good.  When is it?  He thought he might have to go into driving trucks for a living after that meeting.  Ah.  Hey, so...  Ha, ha, ha!  So when is this meeting?  Ha, ha, ha.  Tell him we can't make it.  We're busy.  Oh, Ken's got to call back and schedule it. 
[01:28:30]  Are you free Tuesday?  Am I free Tuesday?  At 11.  At 11 in the morning?  I had planned on leveling my EverQuest character a little more, but I think a meeting with  the head muckety-muck of this corporation might...  Anthony is saying that he's busy.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What are you saying?  He goes, tell him I'll pass that along.  Of course, it would be an honor.  Look at this strategy, though.  He's going to talk to us when we're a little weak early in the morning. 
[01:29:00]  We're not quite awake.  Like, we're not as sharp as we are at 3 o'clock every day.  I'm not sharp at 3 anyway.  All right.  Yeah, I guess that would be fine.  11 o'clock Tuesday.  Yes.  Big meeting.  Anything else?  Oh, boy.  Okay.  All right.  I'll call you during break.  Bye, Kent.  Tell him bye from me.  Hold on a second.  Yeah.  Let me get that.  Hi, Kent.  Hey, how you doing?  I just wanted to say bye. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  I love you.  There you go, Obey.  Did he hang up?  I hope that made him hang up.  Oh, right.  So now we got Tuesday at 11?  Yeah.  Penciled in?  Tentatively penciled in?  You guys can't take any crap at that meeting.  You got to go right in there.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's going to be the same way as it was last time, only hopefully we won't be getting yelled  at as much.  I'm going to sit there.  I'm going to feel exactly like I felt when I broke that young boy's thermos back in the 
[01:30:00]  third grade and was called into the office.  I was 26 at the time, but no, I'm teasing, of course.  I told you that story when I was out in the playground and I broke a kid's thermos.  And I know the kid didn't see, so I got away with it.  Because it's fun to break those glass-lined thermoses.  You hear them go, poof.  And I'm sitting in class, and this little African-American kid, Earl, comes walking in  with a teacher.  I'm up at the board doing a little problem, and the kid just doesn't say a word. 
[01:30:30]  He looks around the room, looks at me, and points his finger at me.  Not a word being said.  The teacher leads him away.  A couple of minutes later, the principal comes in and takes me out of class to ask me why  I broke the thermos.  Spook Radley.  Spook Radley.  Oh, my God.  He ratted me out, Earl.  Sold me out. 
[01:31:00]  I'm still looking for that rat.  Oh, man.  I think that was supposed to be a private conversation.  I don't think the whole country was supposed to know that we're taking a meeting with the  big guy.  You didn't let...  And look at the stock price.  It's wobbling now.  No, it isn't.  It's after four.  You mean an after-hour trading?  Wow, that's something.  Is that a good...  Ken, what's the vibe there?  We've met with this gentleman once when we got hired, once right after a Christmas vacation 
[01:31:30]  when I swear to God I thought we were going there to be fired.  Well, yeah, we were supposed to be fired that day.  And now, for some reason, it's probably because Fareed is no longer the head of Infinity Broadcast.  Does this have something to do with the great ratings this radio station got today?  You know he's going to bring that up. 
[01:32:00]  It's going to go like this.  Well, who's first?  I just hear there's going to be a pool table and a tub of axle grease in there.  Me and Obi are going to walk in wearing pigtails and our shirts tied up and red Kool-Aid  on our lips to look like lipstick.  That's right.  We're going to see Vern Schillinger.  You know, our listeners are really quick.  Look at this one.  Brad, what's up? 
[01:32:30]  Hey, what are you guys going to work for now?  Yeah, you kind of would have to think something like that, wouldn't you?  Oh, man.  It's ridiculous.  You know, it's always space back here in Boston for you.  There's a couple of radio stations around here.  Let's just put it this way.  This guy, this guy that has that big building way upstairs,  he doesn't even have time during the day to eat.  So why is he spending time with us?  Oh, God.  Hey, you guys are screwed.  But you guys stuck anyways knowing your rule.  Nice, pal.  I like flying under the radar, they call it. 
[01:33:00]  He ain't meeting us to ask us what we're doing on vacation.  So, how are you guys doing?  Hey.  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  Hi, guys.  Just called you up to say how are you.  And you know what the worst thing is?  Is how the meeting progresses.  First, we are led into a conference room.  This is how it always happens.  And we sit down.  You're describing all our meetings over the years.  Yeah.  The bosses have changed, but we've been in so many of these meetings,  and they're the most uncomfortable thing in the world. 
[01:33:30]  They sit you in the conference room, and then you have to wait and wait.  They purposely make you wait and make you think about why the hell you could possibly be sitting there.  So, in your head, you're going through everything.  Oh, the Rolodex of F-ups are just.  Oh, all right.  Could it be about Jim and all the pedophile crap he does?  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  In his private life or on the air?  All right.  Do we have an answer for that?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll see this.  That's good.  Okay.  I got a defense for that.  Right.  All right.  Maybe he's friends with Buddy Hackett. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, why don't you impress him with your Hackett call, Opie?  That's a good opener.  Quit bothering my friend, or I'll fire you.  Did you call Buddy Hackett?  Oh, damn.  I didn't anticipate this one.  Yeah, why don't we go up to him with some dog food and say it's a great appetizer?  You know what?  Now, a lot of the guys say you're a fair guy who can come to for advice or maybe financial backing if you've got an idea. 
[01:34:30]  Cran-ma's, Cran-mell's delicious mystery appetizer.  And you know what?  The opening line is never good.  It's never good.  It instantly puts you in a situation of a very defensive posture.  Defensive?  There's no answer to the question.  There's no answer.  There's never an answer to the question he asks.  No, it's always the guy at the bridge that you have to answer the question before you can cross the bridge, and there's no correct answer. 
[01:35:00]  That is the position you're put in when you first sit down.  And how anxious was Ken that he needed to talk to us?  During the show.  During the show, because he said, you know, I told you to call me during the break.  Well, wait for us to break.  He can't even wait for us to break.  No.  Now, you know he's right on the phone.  It's not one of those calls that wait.  It's like, okay, sir, how is Tuesday at 11 for you?  But, sir, I really do believe he's the worst program director in America. 
[01:35:30]  I know that affects the stock price.  I'm sorry, sir.  Yeah.  I need to speak my mind.  Let's send Earl and Stinky as a joke.  To say that I just came back from vacation?  Yeah.  You were down in the Bahamas getting a little tan.  That's it.  I can guarantee you this much.  Yeah.  It's, he's all business.  It's never, ever a social call.  This is not a, I just want to see how you guys are doing. 
[01:36:00]  Stop it.  It's so true.  And why do we have to wait now?  Now we got Saturday, Sunday.  Oh, oh, God.  The anxiety that we felt the last couple days continues.  You know what I'm thinking, maybe?  Yeah, I'm thinking that's it.  That it's going to be Opie and Anthony and Bob Buckman show on the queue.  No, of course not.  Opie, seriously, though, do you think it's what I think it is? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Do you think it's what Fareed was talking about?  Yeah.  During the last meeting?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, no.  Yeah.  We're going to have some problems.  Yeah.  Get ready, radio insider people, for some huge news.  Alert.  Alan Sniffen and New York Radio Message Board, alert.  Keep your ears open for some giant news.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, no.  He does know how much we hate those two, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Interesting.  Stay tuned.  You know when you said monkeys can spin records?  We've hired monkeys.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  Oh, boy. 
[01:37:30]  Now, it's another whole goddamn weekend of thinking.  Just like vacation.  Remember our vacation last year?  We didn't have one because we had to wait a week for the last meeting.  Calls with Ken Stevens and Jeremy about.  I never understood making someone wait to get fired.  That's what they did in Boston to us.  We had to wait a week in Boston before we got fired.  No, that was the internal investigation, Opie.  Remember, they were trying to determine who else was responsible and what course of punishment 
[01:38:00]  should be given to them before, as the woman said who was doing the review, we're going  to get through this and we'll just get you guys back on the air again.  Are you listening, Dave Dickless?  You're listening to two men that didn't sell you down the river.  That's why you have your job still, douche.  I would have.  Sell him out.  We could have sold him out.  I know what the meeting's about, by the way.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mel wants to know if he can get a ticket for my town hall show.  Oh, God.  You are just...  Put a plug in at a moment like this.  Are you insane?  You didn't even mention the name. 
[01:38:30]  What?  I mean, Vic Tabak.  Oh, well.  Sure.  Freaking Sean.  Listen to Sean.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, Opie, maybe he just wants to invite you in to guess his age.  You are an ass, man.  You are a jack tool ass eff.  Junk mail Jerry from New York.  Oh, man. 
[01:39:00]  Hitting the radio chick now is like the last group of shots they laid into Sonny Corleone  as he was already laying on the pavement.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Hello, Carlo.  And the little feet going against the windshield.  All right.  All right.  Well, we'll let you know, people. 
[01:39:30]  We'll let you know when we know.  Any more calls coming in on that contraption opener?  You are fire.  Worse than Vince McMahon.  It's like it's a worse feeling than the intimidation you feel when you are talking with a Vince McMahon.  Yeah, I think.  Because there's absolutely no comedy that goes along at one of those meetings.  Yeah, I think I'd rather have sex with my grandma. 
[01:40:00]  Again?  No, the dead one.  What?  The dead one.  Yeah, this is, uh...  Oh, boy.  Hmm.  I wonder what the hell they're going to be playing here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Oh, yeah?  Recorded, Opie?  I hope we're more believable at the meeting.  Maybe we could just re-record ourselves.  It sounds so spontaneous when we do it in commercials. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got Kevin Meany outside the studio.  He's been waiting a long time.  He's playing Caroline's here in New York City this weekend.  Rich Boston's out there.  Anthony's entire family's out there.  I think they took off.  I hooked them up.  They wanted T-shirts.  It seems my aunt and uncle, Robert and Yvonne,  their kids, RJ and Chris.  Chris sells the bumper stickers at his school. 
[01:41:00]  So it's pretty much just a big pile of cash we just gave him.  So have fun with that.  Oscar, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, my family knows how to organize, get some goods, and make money out of it.  I was going to make that joke, but I saw your uncle, and I'm keeping my lips sealed.  Doesn't my uncle Tony, who does he look like, Rick?  Paulie Walnuts.  He looks just like Paulie Walnuts.  Yes, he does.  Dude, he shook my hand.  It's still throbbing.  He has a good handshake. 
[01:41:30]  Bumper stickers are $1, $2 if Anthony signs it.  And he fell off the truck.  That's all.  What's up, Oscar?  Also got some fur coats and TVs if you need them.  Boys, I was hoping you could do me a favor.  If you could push up the final voting on the Naughty Nighty to Monday,  so that way I can make sure I know who won, because I don't know about Tuesday.  Back to you, Rusty.  All right, you pass.  I know.  We're going to announce the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest on Tuesday.  Right.  During the show, and you can keep voting between now and then. 
[01:42:00]  You can vote every day, blah, blah, blah.  Go to opandanthony.com, okay?  They stole WOW stickers off the Lufthansa flight.  Wow.  Wow.  And security?  You're looking at it.  Mike Starr, great performance.  I told you, don't put the stickers on the cars.  That's a wedding present in my mother's name.  I love that sticker.  Steve C. from foundrymusic.com. 
[01:42:30]  He hasn't been around the joint the last couple of days,  because he's in Vegas celebrating his birthday.  He's taken his responsibilities and shirked them.  That's right.  Yes.  Sounds like I'm doing a little bit better than you guys, though.  At least at the moment.  I'm not being yelled at by anybody.  At least not yet.  Well, you haven't been yelled at.  Well, not yet.  I hear you're snotted.  Oh, well, not at the moment.  I was until about 3 o'clock yesterday morning, or this morning.  Bloody Marys, they just flow freely, 
[01:43:00]  as long as you keep plunking the little quarters into the slot machines.  Bloody Marys should have a prescription on them,  because it is like a medicine for your hangover.  If you're hungover, if you're hungover, and you drink one Bloody Mary,  you say to yourself things like,  I could not have possibly felt as crappy as I thought I did five minutes ago.  There is no way.  Like, I thought I was, well, going to die five minutes ago.  And now, I feel fine.  How does that happen?  The wonderful Bloody Mary. 
[01:43:30]  This town has the art of robbing you blind and numbing you down to an art.  Vegas.  I am down 300 so far.  I've only been here less than 48 hours.  It's not bad.  That's not bad.  Where are you staying, Steve?  Where are you staying?  Bellagio.  Oh, nice, man.  Nice.  Very nice.  Nice.  Very nice.  It's very cheap to stay at a hotel like this now,  because this town is always close to me.  Mikey, how you doing?  Draw chips for everybody.  The dancers will kick your tongue out. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, that's for you to find out.  Come on, scram.  Come on, Steve.  You don't come to Vegas and talk to Steve C. from Foundry like that.  Buy me out.  Buy me out.  No, I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.  I buy you out.  WNW don't have that kind of muscle anymore. 
[01:44:30]  So what's up, Steve C.?  Oh, no.  You know something?  The entertainment out here is unparalleled as usual.  We've got a Tony Orlando at the Golden Nuggets.  Oh, yeah.  You should see the rooms these guys play in.  They're tiny, some of them.  Some of them are playing in huge theaters.  Took a huge gamble and lost last night.  Saw the amazing Jonathan.  Oh, he's usually really funny.  I thought that was a good act to say.  Oh.  Why? 
[01:45:00]  The guy hasn't written a new joke in 15 years.  Oh, wait.  Now.  Boss has newer material.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're welcome.  Boss is here, you idiot.  Boss is sitting right here, Steve.  I know.  I know.  That's why I said that.  Yeah.  Hey, Steve, you want me to get you into improv out there?  I can make a call if you want to go there tonight.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  I'm actually seeing Cirque du Soleil tonight.  Titus is in town.  I might check him out, too.  The amazing boss.  You know something?  If you saw him on the Sunday comics when Lenny Clark was hosting like 13 years ago, you saw 
[01:45:30]  the act I saw last night.  Wow.  Verbatim.  He's just older and fatter now.  I can get you into improv.  He's the exact same act.  Boss is really bugging me.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Steve, but you're out in Vegas having a good time, and he's giving  you these white trash comps.  Hey, man, I can get you bumped up on the buffet line over there at the palace station.  Try to be friendly.  Try to be a little friendly.  Can't get him in to see Copperfield or any really major.  I can get you over there to the improv. 
[01:46:00]  I can get you a ticket on the roller coaster up on top of the needle.  It's open night.  Hey, Steve, I got friends in Wildwood.  So if you want a jump line on the water park, maybe this sucks.  Oh, sure.  Hey, Steve, Kevin has a question for you.  Yeah.  Kevin, go ahead.  You're on with Steve C. from FoundryMusic.com.  Yeah, I have a question since you're in Vegas.  What's more confusing, the pie gal poker or navigating your site?  Oh, God.  You got, oh.  You know, it's a toss-up.  Talk to you guys later. 
[01:46:30]  Steve, what are you playing?  What?  What games are you playing?  I'm playing blackjack and playing the slot.  Do you have any good hands?  Any good hand stories?  No, no.  You know something?  I'm sure there's a science to this gambling crap, but I have yet to figure it out.  I suck so bad.  The casinos love people like you.  Yep.  I pissed away $100 in 10 minutes in a $5 slot machine because I thought it was going to pay off.  Slots blow.  That's the biggest sucker bet.  Slots blow.  Because you know something? 
[01:47:00]  At least when you're sitting at a blackjack table, you're getting something for your money.  You're getting a little bit of excitement.  You're getting a little community event that's going on.  You against the dealer kind of thing.  Yeah.  Right.  There's the adrenaline that comes with a good hand.  Adrenaline that comes with taking a hit on a 14 if you have to.  But I'll tell you.  The slots?  Nah.  You're sitting there with old geriatrics that smell like their own fluids. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to shoot craps, man.  You've got to play craps.  That I heard is really like the most exciting game.  And you want to make it really show you when you're shooting, take the dice and throw them  onto the next table?  It just really pisses everybody off.  They have Baccarat out there.  They throw you bodily from the establishment.  Did you see the nickel slot players there?  Huh?  Did you see them playing?  Talk about, that's like an alcoholic drinking sterno.  The nickel.  They look at the penny slot players and go, white trash.  Are there penny slots in Vegas still? 
[01:48:00]  I never played.  I didn't have enough money.  Is this the 1890 Voss?  They got pennies.  I remember back in the saloon.  Want to buy a swinging saloon door?  Oh, no.  Here we go.  What do you got, Voss?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's a great picture.  This is up on Foundry?  Yeah.  It's an advertisement. 
[01:48:30]  Voss Appliance Center.  With a picture of Voss in a slick suit.  With a slick 70s wide lapel suit.  Saying, want to buy a dryer door?  He knows the struggle, all highlighted.  And he's standing by a brand new dryer.  Very funny.  Go to Foundry.  And if you can navigate it, you might have good luck.  You really got to shoot craps.  That's the best odds in the casino.  Dude, all you do is call me and ask somebody.  I'm checking out the craps table.  I'm checking out Baccarat, too.  But those are like Asian guys that are playing $10,000 a hand. 
[01:49:00]  Baccarat, really?  Hey, James Bond.  Calm down on your games over there.  Steve, did you check us out on the station out there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I didn't tell you.  That's AM Stinks.  AM Sucks.  Right.  I have no idea who's board-opping the KFSM board.  But they're like dumping.  They're cutting you off halfway through the sweepers into breaks.  And they're bringing you back without a sweeper.  So it's just commercial into rejoiner beds.  So it's just, you know, okay, you know, commercial for Ben Gay.  And then all of a sudden there's some music bed and you guys are back on. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, Steve, you talked to anyone from the station today?  Oh, not at all, actually.  Seriously?  Uh, what, this?  No, not at all.  You didn't hear the big news?  What big news?  You didn't hear?  No.  What happened?  Oh, you suck!  Dude, you are the worst, man.  You don't say that and then hang up.  That's great.  Poor bastard.  That's the guy you want to make angry.  The Lebanese with a drinking problem.  He's smart.  He's going to come back broke. 
[01:50:00]  He's going to be all pissed at his gambling losses.  Those big man arms.  All right, we got to get Meanie in here.  We got Voss in here.  Voss showing us his pictures of the big double-decker bus in England.  With the wow sticker.  With the wow sticker on it.  Yeah.  That was great.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, I'm mixing on 85 to the Bang Bang thing.  Oh, the Bang Bang Bang.  Oh, God, it's Friday.  Yeah.  And I recorded it, if you guys want to hear it.  Oh, yeah, why not?  Let's hear it, man.  Do it. 
[01:50:30]  All right, hold on.  This goes back to last Friday's show.  Oh, Chris.  Just have it set up.  He should actually be...  Welcome to the weekend.  Yeah.  It's going to be sunny and beautiful all week long.  It's hard to hear, right? 
[01:51:00]  No, I was getting into it.  It's very distorted.  Yeah, but I wanted to hear maybe when he got into the bang on your drum part.  Yeah.  But they do the woo-hoo part.  Those were people doing woo-hoo.  Yeah, but maybe it goes into the bang, bang, bang.  Dude, you cut him off.  I thought we were having a tough time out here.  Hey, Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I was just wondering if it's true that 1894,  those are two bits and he's been dodging her.  Wah, wah, wah.  Two bits. 
[01:51:30]  Ah, yes.  I owe my girls money.  They're dodging me.  Ah, yeah.  Get away from me, kid.  I owe you money.  Oh, vaudeville Voss.  Vaudeville Voss.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  I think a great segment on the show should be like 15 minutes of Voss Friendly, maybe. 
[01:52:00]  You know, let a couple callers call in.  You know something, though?  No matter how much crap we give you, I will always say this is one of the funniest guys to go see live.  Thank you.  Come on.  And if you're in Ocean Township this weekend, I'm at Rascals.  Oh, and he's a whore.  What type of plug is that?  Wow.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have mentioned Rascals in Ocean.  I hung out last night with Jeff from Foundry.  He's miserable.  Oh, I love Jeff.  He really, was he 22, and he's got a rope and a stool already engraved?  He's an alcoholic, and he's very unhappy with a bad beard.  I love Jeff.  I was next to the boys going, I am so ugly. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, yeah, I know.  He was saying that in a strip club to me.  He's like, I'm broke.  These bitches don't even talk to you if you don't have money.  Wow, that's an amazing revelation to have in a strip club, young fella.  I love this guy, man.  He really is great.  He puked all over during the first trip.  Where were we?  Our first trip to Philly.  Oh, to Philly.  Yeah, we went to that strip club.  I'm so ugly.  I'm so ugly.  He took a ride with us in the cab.  We were all loaded in, and he gets out.  The first thing he does is just vomit all over the parking lot of the strip club, and 
[01:53:00]  he's just like, oh, I'm sorry.  Nothing worse than the drunk puke apologizing guy.  He's like, don't apologize.  Oh, dude, I'm sorry, man.  I'm sorry.  And then he fell asleep, too.  Yeah, then he fell asleep in the...  If you're a puke, drunk, parking lot guy, and then you become fall asleep in the strip  club guy, oh, it's over.  Just kill yourself.  Because you're going to be thrown on the bed and mounted from the back guy.  I need that sound. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, the guys at the tunnel, too, real quick.  I was going through the Lincoln Tunnel.  The National Guard guys, I was talking to them.  They said they need some girls to drive by and show them some wow.  Ah, well, of course.  Well, that would be great if that happens for them.  Right.  The National Guard guys.  Yeah, that's what I was talking about.  People really want to, like, flash to law enforcement people.  Take that gamble that maybe these are the guys that were asking for it, and not the guys  that are going to just wrestle you to the ground.  She's got two guns. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, we've got to get Kevin Meaney in here.  Yeah, come on.  Kevin's been sitting out there for a while.  All right, why don't we take a break, and Kevin Meaney's up next with us here.  Boss in the studio.  I mean, Kevin Meaney playing Carolines this weekend, so very funny guy.  You've got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  Oh, s***, you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass. 
[01:54:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony Sam Adams.  For boss.  Hey, we love the Sam.  Drink it all the time here.  Hope he's burping a little bit, chugging that Sam down a little too quick.  Actually, it was chilly today.  Was it?  Found a good chilly today.  Sam Adams goes great with chilly.  It really does.  It does.  Even when you're brewing, you put a little bit in there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sam Adams.  You know something?  Baseball season.  Major League Baseball spring training underway as we speak.  And Sam Adams is a great American beer, just like the great American pastime. 
[01:55:00]  And they go together great.  You watch the games, you drink a Sam.  You're at the game, you drink the Sam.  You're driving home, you drink...  Well, no.  Okay.  I won't go that far.  I couldn't.  But you drink the Sam, you drive.  It's fun.  Good, clean fun.  America's best tasting beer.  And, boy, that's for sure.  We love it.  It's not weak.  Other beers, they're weak.  Sam Adams, great beer.  You're going to love it.  Pick some up.  Bring it home.  Or if you're at the bar, order one.  Sam Adams.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:55:30]  In studio, Kevin Meany playing Caroline's this weekend in New York City.  Kevin Meany.  But, Kevin, how do you spell Meany?  M-E-A-N-E-Y.  M-E-A-N-E-Y.  Yes.  That's how you spell the Meany name.  I was going to KevinMeany.com to check out his KevCam.  I get some response when I'm on your program on KevinMeany.com. 
[01:56:00]  And...  A good response, right?  Very good response.  But I had a couple of people in there that were very nasty.  Don't let a couple of rotten apples spoil it.  No, but they were mean and cruel.  Were they?  And lonely.  How come this is a live KevCam and it's updating and you're sitting there...  I'm not there.  Yet you're here.  Yes, that is in my garage, but I just thought that's a frozen picture of me.  Yes, it is.  Is that the shot of him that looks like he just woke up?  No, because somebody changed it to a more respectable shot.  Kevin, we checked out your website from time to time. 
[01:56:30]  And one time we went on there, it looked like you just woke up there.  I do.  I guess it was good in the morning.  Yeah.  And that's the beauty of the live KevCam.  You get to see me, you know, not changing my clothes or anything.  But all different.  No nude Kev on the...  No, no.  Actually, one time I think they did catch me naked.  Really?  That's hot.  Yeah.  Now, what room is this cluttered with videotapes and...  Is that his garage?  That's my garage, yes.  Is it the garage?  You actually have to go out to the garage to use that newfangled computer?  Yes, I do.  You do? 
[01:57:00]  Yes, because the house, you don't want that in the house.  Oh, you don't want the camera in the house?  No, it's not the camera.  The computer?  It's all of my junk that now that I'm married, I can't have that.  It was my house before I got married.  This looks like the kind of...  And then after I got married, all of my things seemed to go into the garage.  Right, because they're not good things.  Yeah, it's not, you know, it's not feminine.  It was good enough for you because you probably had some of this stuff when you were 18 years old.  Oh, and let me tell you, she loved that house when she first saw it. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, I bet.  And the minute she got married, all of the stuff went out to the garage and new things came in.  All the sentimental things that reminded her of you that were cute are now just your clutter.  Yeah, it's just, you know, my Emmy Award is in the garage.  Is your Emmy Award in the garage?  Yes, of course it is.  Why would you put that inside?  No, that's mine.  So it's yours, it's got to go outside.  It's out in the garage.  I'm looking at the picture with the videotapes on this.  It looks like a bookcase you nailed together yourself.  It's the garage.  Why do I need to have nice things in the garage? 
[01:58:00]  Because it looks like you're analyzing my, it's a garage.  It looks like a room they would gather evidence from after a child abduction.  Oh, thank you.  Well, thank you.  Now I'm David Westerfield all of a sudden.  I'm just saying, it's kind of got that dark, cluttered look.  And I see the Emmy on top of the TV behind your head.  Yes, you do see the Emmy.  He is not lying.  The Emmy is in the goddamn garage.  She doesn't like the Emmy?  I love the Emmy.  I'm there in the garage most of the time.  Your wife told you to take the Emmy in the garage. 
[01:58:30]  No, she didn't.  Yes, she did.  Why'd you win it?  I would put an Emmy.  I won an Emmy award, a local Emmy award.  May I, you know, just say.  Oh, that's different.  Oh, stop it.  You know, when Chuck Scarborough goes on and says the Emmy award-winning news, they don't  say the local Emmy award-winning news.  What was the award for?  It was for a program I did in San Francisco called Comedy Tonight.  Wow.  Okay.  And I won that Emmy award in 1985.  I have a question.  What's an award?  Give Voss. 
[01:59:00]  Yes.  Look at Rich Voss.  All of a sudden, he doesn't have an award.  He has tattoos.  Mutilated himself.  And a nice Jewish boy, too, that aren't supposed to get tattoos.  What's wrong with you?  He cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery now.  I care.  I die every night.  All of a sudden, I care about him.  Who's going to trust burials at this point?  Oh, I know, right?  Hey, the burner's broke.  Put him out in the shed.  Anthony, I got audio from Kevin Meaney's garage.  You do?  Yeah.  It rubs lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told. 
[01:59:30]  That does.  That sounds like it's from Hannibal.  No, that's Kevin Meaney.  Yeah.  That's not me.  You know, I know Kevin Meaney has done...  I know he's done a lot of radio.  I've done a lot of...  And he came walking in here, and he looked around like, this is not like every other show  I do.  There's people drinking in the corner.  I didn't...  I saw you.  I saw you looked around going, what's going on here?  It looks like there's a party going on.  They're playing the foosball outside.  Would you like a Sam Adams?  Would you like to play some foosball?  I'd like a shot of Jack Daniels.  Do you have that?  We have a chilled Jägermeister out of the machine. 
[02:00:00]  Sure.  I'd love to get all liquored up before my show.  You know, that's fun.  You know, and then, you know, if you, you know, you'll stumble on a, you know, one of  your prepared lines, and, you know, and that's, you know, that even makes it more exciting  for the audience.  Everyone laughs.  He's drinking.  Right.  It's unpredictable and dangerous.  Maybe we'll see this in a made-for-TV movie when he sobers up, you know.  And then they can all point and go, I was at this show. 
[02:00:30]  I was there when he was drinking heavily.  Yeah.  Right before he went into scripts.  You want some whores or something?  We could get you a hooker or anything you need.  Yeah, I'd love to.  That would be great.  Speaking of which, we got some special guests outside.  Who?  Some special guests that want to meet Kevin Meany.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got their song and everything, too.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Oh, no, not these two.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and we're nauseating.  Yeah.  With someone's oil, there's no one can take it.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  If we look in the mirror, we break it. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  We'll give you nightmares, old table.  Yeah.  Like a couple of weevils.  A circuit.  A count of sex appeal.  Yeah.  Make sense for us, it's not possible.  A warthog.  Warthog.  And Godzilla in leather pants.  Isn't it catchy?  I love it.  Yes, we're both retarded.  Retarded.  Yeah.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both retarded.  Retarded.  We should warn him, bro.  Make any other thing. 
[02:01:30]  No.  No, don't warn me.  Turn it.  Kevin, just go with it.  You're hot.  Don't go away.  I know, right?  You're hot.  All right.  Well, then, just bring them in.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  It's Lady Di and Marion.  Lady Di and Marion.  They've been friends for life.  They've been friends forever.  Oh, God.  How are you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  How is everybody?  Hi, hi, guys.  Oh, hey, Opie.  Congratulations on your cousin winning the gold. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you.  Look at this.  Isn't that something?  She skates at the garden once in a while in between the Ranger Games.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah?  I go there and I support her.  Yeah.  I go to Ranger Games, Anthony.  That's how I know.  Uh-huh.  Sarah Hughes.  Are you still living under a bridge?  Her hands are all disgusting.  I know.  Are you really retarded?  Yay, yay, party.  I don't know.  I just want to find out.  No.  No, you're not.  We're not retarded.  We're going to crazy.  They sit around and go, tell me about the rabbits. 
[02:02:30]  No, you tell me about the rabbits.  I don't know.  Opie, I want to tell you something, too.  It's not about me.  It's about Kevin Meaney.  Her younger sister also skates at the garden.  I know that.  I'm related to her.  What did lady do I do to her hair?  I don't know.  Look at it.  I'm fascinated.  I am fixated on it.  I cannot take my eyes off of that hairdo.  I've never actually seen a rhinoceros with a herpes sore.  I know.  What is that thing on your lips?  I didn't say you're finally growing some hair.  Thank you, Mullen. 
[02:03:00]  What is that on your lip?  That is awful.  How do you have a herpes sore?  Let me see.  It's a cold sore.  Oh, that's not bad.  That's not bad.  Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.  That's not bad.  God, and you had to notice that, Norton.  How do you not notice that?  It's a little tiny cold sore.  It's a terrible Michelle.  She's got one hairdo.  What is that?  Lady Di, what did you do to the hair?  You got the little Dorothy Hamill cut for the Olympics, didn't you?  And look, she's doing the Hamill camel without the Hamill part. 
[02:03:30]  She put a bow on her head.  I got a haircut.  You did, did you?  From Lawn Doctor?  She did her sound.  Look at that head.  Oh, my Lord.  Look at the little one.  Look how fast she is when she turns around her French or a welcoming home party.  We're working.  We're working out now.  Oh, that's not right.  Hey, they're working out.  Look at yourself, Rich Voss.  They think they're very attractive.  They're very nice ladies.  They think they're very nice.  They are very nice.  And then they see Jonathan.  Hey, Kevin, honey, I know I'm attractive. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, you sell it, baby.  I am, too.  You're nice ladies.  She does aerobics.  I do the treadmill and the weights.  Yeah.  In a bike.  The treadmill and the weights.  Is that where you eat your lunch on a treadmill?  I didn't eat no lunch today.  No lunch?  No lunch.  How many pounds have you girls lost?  I lost eight.  Eight?  I lost about five.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  I like the new hairdo on Lady Di.  I like it.  It's almost like that old-style flapper hairdo. 
[02:04:30]  If she was a flapper that dislodged her jaw and swallowed Al Capone.  You want to lose weight?  It's the Asian leukemia look.  I'm just saying, I thought you'd go for a longer thing.  You guys are shocking our guest, Kevin Meany.  I don't think so.  Why do you have to be so mean to these girls?  What did they do?  They showed up.  They came in and recorded.  Did you record that song?  Do you know them like we don't know?  You don't know them like we do.  I don't know where all this hatred is coming from. 
[02:05:00]  Lady Di's hair is awful.  It looks like the younger version of Throw Mama from the Train.  But they're talking about that you're fat.  They look like the cash from the white misbehaving.  Look at them, how fat they are.  You're not fat?  Fat is somebody who's like 200 pounds and over.  And Norton's blood's not tantrum.  I've seen better haircuts given by chemo.  180.  So she weighs 180.  180, Kevin.  That's good, right?  That's less than I. 
[02:05:30]  Less than me.  Oh, yeah?  Kevin.  I'm not going to see how much I weigh.  Kevin, would you like to see their boobs?  Not mine.  No, I don't want to see them.  And he's serious.  He's goddamn serious about that.  No.  I'm a married man.  I've got a daughter now.  Oh, see?  Now, listen.  You know, imagine my daughter coming.  How old are you?  How old am I?  Yes.  39.  39.  Well, I'll be dead by the time my daughter's 39.  I'm not 38.  But imagine her, like, you know, showing her breasts, you know.  Oh, see, that would horrify you.  Why would you want to do that?  Why would you want to show you?  Kevin, there's no place for morality on this program. 
[02:06:00]  No, I'm divorced.  You're divorced?  Yeah.  You have children?  Yes, I do.  And you want this child to know that you showed your breasts?  He came out of a drunk stupor of 20 years.  His sponsor said divorce.  No, but I think that this is...  How old are the kids?  I don't have any kids.  Well, then you can show your breasts.  My kid is 11 years old.  So you want him to know that you show your breasts on the radio?  What's wrong with breasts, Kevin?  Kevin? 
[02:06:30]  Kevin, there's nothing wrong with the breasts.  Well, the lady died.  All right, turn around and show him.  Oh, wow, right?  Yeah.  We've got to lose him.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Down syndrome.  Thank you, Sean.  Show your...  Down syndrome.  Hey, I'm trying to wear the...  Show your...  Kevin goes, you think you could have shaved before?  Oh, look at all...  Zipper, put your zipper down.  I'll pull my shirt off.  Oh, he'll do it.  He'll do it.  What kind of zipper? 
[02:07:00]  That was something I...  Now he said zipper.  All right, hold on.  Jay wants to say something.  Hold on.  Jay, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  Hey.  Erwin.  Erwin.  Yeah, what's up, cute?  Later, boys.  Erwin.  Are you for real?  Erwin.  No, it ain't.  What?  Why?  Who?  What are you doing?  What are you going to do now?  Are you going to show your breasts?  What's the special thing you're doing now that's...  I don't know. 
[02:07:30]  What about your lower area?  Oh, yeah.  No, I don't show that.  Let me show yours.  I don't do that.  I don't do it either.  Well, your partner is showing her breasts.  That's her business.  She wants to do what she wants to do.  She wants to do what she wants to do.  You would both come in there.  Why should you sell the lower area when we could smell it already?  Oh, my God.  Hey, boss.  I feel something coming out of you.  Oh, you must have crap stains in your underwear.  Oh, wow.  She comes right back.  Crap stains.  Wow. 
[02:08:00]  What's next?  An Archie Bunker impression?  Oh.  Hey, go back to Plainfield.  Go back to Plainfield.  Oh, look at her.  Why look at her breasts?  Just look at the fat under her chin and put a nipple on it.  Oh, please.  That's horrible.  Isn't that awful?  Kevin, I'm used to this.  Yeah.  You know what?  He lives like a man's backyard.  All life.  What kind of a marriage do you have where you're used to this?  You know, imagine coming home.  I'm used to this.  Hey, Opie, do you know Rich Boss and Diane are like neighbors?  Oh, yeah?  They live like right around a block from each other.  Oh, that's special. 
[02:08:30]  Thank you, Rand McCullough.  Isn't that great?  A little wave over the backyard fence.  How are you?  I love you.  Oh, God.  What happened to a man?  What happened to a man?  What happened to a man?  Do you live in Jersey?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who knew?  Oh, Jim.  Where are you?  Who knew?  Do you live in Jersey?  No, I don't.  Do you live in New York here?  Do you live in L.A.?  I live in L.A., and now we're actually moving back to New York.  Oh, you are, Kevin Meany.  Kevin, what do you do?  If you visit that one, once a month, you'll probably see us.  Once a month, I'll see you?  If you visit these guys once a month.  Why doesn't somebody come up with a once-a-month joke here? 
[02:09:00]  Hey, okay.  How about that?  Would that be something to do with a period or something?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, your sweatshirt friend.  Come on, get me out.  You're not believing about the not-retarded thing, Kevin, aren't you?  Well, you know, it was the lisp that I thought maybe there might be some retardation.  My teeth are crooked.  There isn't.  No, I didn't know.  I really, you know, because...  Wait a minute.  You do this big Laverne and Shirley thing. 
[02:09:30]  We're retarded.  Retarded.  Making the dream come true.  And I'm, like, listening to it on the headphones, and then you come in, and I kind of say,  I just want to be honest.  We're not retarded.  Okay, you're not retarded.  You're not retarded.  But we're a lot of fun.  You are fun.  And your teeth are crooked?  No, the teeth are nice.  Listen, they don't have English-British teeth.  We're all chipped.  You're not supposed to suck on the dildo.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What about our teeth? 
[02:10:00]  Those teeth should be snapping at Sigourney Weaver's face.  They both have very nice teeth.  They're awful teeth.  No, they have very nice teeth.  I'll tell you.  I've seen them all.  That is it.  What about yellow?  They're yellow.  I don't know.  They're yellow.  You look like you've got butter.  Look at you.  I don't eat butter.  I eat jelly.  What?  Eat jelly?  Will you please pass the jelly?  I do.  Yeah.  You don't put butter on it?  Are you so?  That's good.  That's good for losing weight, too. 
[02:10:30]  You're not using the butter.  Well, we work out.  We've got a Lucille Roberts.  They work out.  You've lost eight pounds in a year.  Stop it.  You're awful.  You're not losing weight.  Lucille Roberts' stock just crashed.  We've been there two weeks.  Two weeks.  Lady Di, how much weight have you lost in two weeks?  Why did they call you Lady Di?  You lost five pounds.  Back up against that CD wall and open up your jacket.  Let me see.  That awful coat.  Now, turn around a little.  Turn around. 
[02:11:00]  Watch the harpoons.  You know what?  I'll be completely honest.  I think you did lose, like, a little bit of weight.  I think you did.  I'll be honest.  I think she did.  It's going to take quite a while.  That might not happen.  Look at that.  I don't think my mic is on.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, there it is.  I'm sorry, Kevin.  I hate her perfectly straight-toothed smile.  That's what bugs me about Lady Di.  What bugs you about Lady Di?  What bugs you?  Tell me.  It's just you have that perfectly straight-toothed smile, and it really is punchable. 
[02:11:30]  You're awful.  Punchable.  Oh, my God.  Punchable.  I have no idea what Norton is talking about, but I think they're both very nice.  And I think you need to really, yeah, I think you should really re-evaluate what you're  going to do.  Lady Di?  Did you do that on Rosie yesterday?  No, that wasn't her.  Did you flash your breasts on Rosie?  No.  We don't like Rosie.  We work.  We work at 10 o'clock in the morning.  Flashing your breasts.  Did you see that?  Somebody flashed their breasts on Rosie.  Oh, I did.  What a wreck that was. 
[02:12:00]  We encourage that.  Rosie took her out last night.  Yeah, Rosie.  It's Rosie's date.  I want to ask the ladies, are you guys going to go see Kevin Meaney tonight?  No.  Why not?  Why not?  He's at Rails Girls in Ocean.  I'll get you tickets.  I'd love for you to sit down with my wife.  We went to see Mario Cantone on Sunday night, and he was funny.  Well, he's not there this Sunday night.  I'm here.  Yeah.  Come on.  He's doing a great show.  I know.  Meaney's there tonight.  Come on.  Do you even know who Kevin Meaney is? 
[02:12:30]  I've heard of him.  Yeah, he's a comedian.  Yeah.  He used to do a TV show.  I forgot what show, right?  I've done television.  In the 80s.  In the 80s, yes.  But I don't know.  I forgot what show in the 80s.  In the 90s also.  It was called Shut Up, You Fat Retard.  I know.  It used to be on Channel 7, I think.  You'll love going to see it tonight.  They have a two roast beef minimum.  I don't eat roast beef.  Really?  You look like you eat roast beef.  You know, it's actually starting to be fun now all of a sudden.  Isn't it?  At first I was offended.  Now I'm kind of getting into it. 
[02:13:00]  You know, it is fun to rag on you.  It's like a mob rules thing.  You get caught up in it.  Let's see those jugs again.  Come on.  Lift them up.  Come on.  There you go.  Come on, Lady Di.  Put them up.  Come on, Lady Di.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Lady Di.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Look at those.  Fantastic.  Aren't they great?  What is that?  That's her liver.  That was like acne, David.  What's that?  That's her liver.  It's hanging out.  You can see her liver.  It's transparent in her skin.  Lady Di.  What was that? 
[02:13:30]  Lady Di, lift up.  Wait, Lady Di.  You still have some dough by your belly button.  I just started working out.  Wait, Lady Di, really?  What is that?  What is it?  That's a bruise.  Turn around.  Let me see.  Do one of your robes too much.  We should have bruised.  Oh, ow.  Turn around.  God damn it.  Hey, turn this way.  Holy Jesus.  It looks like someone kicked her.  There's a different...  I can't even see it.  How'd you get that, Lady Di?  She missed her mouth.  Did you get hit by a car while you were pulling a little carriage  and people in it?  No, I did not get hit by a car. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, someone wants to ask Kevin Meaney a question.  Jimmy, what's up?  Jimmy.  Hello, Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Emmy, something with an Emmy ending.  He wants to ask, why is Kevin being so nice?  Kevin's a nice guy.  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  Hey, what happened to your Pillsbury Doughboy chef guy?  Uh-oh, he's going to call me.  What?  What happened to him?  Frenchie.  What happened to the Pillsbury Doughboy?  Oh, you're all brave when he's not here.  See, I heard about the record.  I'm listening to something.  It's funny.  A record?  A record?  A record?  A record? 
[02:14:30]  You stupid faggot.  It's on the computer.  My bad record.  Fattest whore in the studio.  That's a record that you're breaking.  Hey, Jim, you look like you're growing hair,  but your face is getting a little puffier.  Are you okay?  What?  Oh, wow.  You have too much fat for one person.  You look like you're, like, really puffy out.  I mean, maybe you need to start working out.  I've got to wear a bib when I hear you talk.  Really?  You know, you need to start, like, come on. 
[02:15:00]  Well, I think they're both very nice,  and I don't think you should be getting into fights like this.  I live late.  This is crazy.  Hey, someone wants to say hi to the ladies.  She wants to.  Hold on here.  Put them on hold.  Who wants to say hello to them?  I don't need one.  Somebody wants to say hello to you.  There we go.  All right.  Hey, Frenchie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Pillsbury Doughboy.  Pillsbury Doughboy, what are you doing?  Hey, you fat retard.  Pillsbury Dough.  You fat hairy retard.  Hey, French.  You making any cookies lately?  It's our favorite French chef, Frenchie.  Pillsbury Doughboy.  Yes.  Pillsbury Doughboy.

We like the guy.  And he called it up.  He's from Canada.  I don't know.  You know, you should pull all your teeth out of your mouth so you can hear what you say,  you whore.  Is Frenchie retarded?  Yeah.  That's not.  Definitely.  Frenchie's the Pillsbury Doughboy because he thinks he knows how to cook. 
[02:16:00]  I haven't tasted anything.  Yeah, and your ass looks like two Pillsbury Dough too, you bitch.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Dad is a great cook.  I don't know about you, Frenchie.  Do you guys, are you guys good cooks?  Yes, we are.  I am a good cook.  I'm not asking you, Frenchie.  I'm asking the gals.  We're not asking.  I'm asking you, Frenchie, because, I mean, don't you have anything to do?  I mean, where's your batter?  Where's your recipes?  Don't you have anything to cook?  Where's your apron?  You have to cook, you bitch.  You call, you call.  You call.  Whoa.  Oh, that's nice. 
[02:16:30]  That's another one.  You stupid retarded bitch that you are.  Why do you curse on the radio?  I'm not the only one who says this to you.  Hey, Frenchie, I think they're winning, Frenchie.  I heard I'm winning.  No, they're not winning.  You sure?  You know what?  Hey, Frenchie, what are you doing?  Why don't you come by?  All right, Frenchie.  Then if Frenchie's going to look a little better than you do, now he's a twat.  He is gay.  Oh, Frenchie is gay.  He sounds like he's a twat.  He is gay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she can suck it all day, that twat.  He sounds like he's a twat.  He sounds like he's a twat.  Hey, Frenchie.  All right, Frenchie, we're going to let you go.

These girls are on fire.  I love it.  Kevin, this is being heard in 18 cities.  Can you believe it?  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, the first day that you went syndicated, I was here.  You were here.  I was here.  For the first day when we were in Philly.  We were.  Now it's 18 cities.  Now it's 18 cities.  Listening to third grade humor. 
[02:17:30]  Third grade?  What are we, graduating?  Well, I'm glad I'm here.  Just kind of defend them a little bit.  They need no defending.  You know, you've got Rich Voss and Norton and Anthony.  Third grade humor.  Everybody is, like, attacking them.  But they seem to be, they want to be attacked.  They love them.  Love you.  You know what their story is, Kevin?  They have been friends forever.  They were, like, went through high school together.  And they used to go out and party all the time.  Party.  Party.  Ying-yang party.  Ying-yang party. 
[02:18:00]  They'd go, yin-yang party.  They used to get tipped.  Their little catchphrase.  And then they'd go out and go to the turtle races.  You guys used to get.  We used to drink.  Hey, didn't you guys used to get tipped together, too?  Together?  No, we used to.  Tipped.  Tipped.  Tipped together?  Tipped?  Yeah, we used to get wrapped together.  You're tipping.  How do you see bunt through a sweatshirt?  That's what I don't know.  He goes, how do you see bunt through a sweatshirt?  That's how you know you're overweight. 
[02:18:30]  You're there now.  I know.  He's your neighbor.  All right.  I know.  All right.  So they don't get to get out and party as much as they used to.  No, I can go out and party.  So they come here.  I'm a party.  Oh, your husband wouldn't like that?  My husband goes out and parties with me.  You have a husband?  He drinks to forget.  Hey, Joe, if you're listening, if you're home, call the show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'd love to hear from that husband.  Please.  There's a guy walking around Long Island with a bag over his head.  He's on Christopher Street getting a mule in his face right now.  He's going to hear.  Oh, that hurts.  Where did you gals get all the gold? 
[02:19:00]  Oh.  We call it bling bling.  Bling bling?  They got some bling bling.  She thinks it's bling bling.  The stuff is thinner than the wrapping that goes around a yodel.  Look how fake it is.  The goddamn, it's like it's nothing.  They've got a lot of gold.  I'm turning green looking at it.  That's how fake it is.  Your eyes are turning green.  What's it say?  It's not fake.  It says, wow.  It says, okay.  Wow.  It's what the man would say.  Genuine 14-carat gold.  No, those chains are very expensive. 
[02:19:30]  It is 14-carat.  14-carat.  14-carat gold plated with genuine Dye-MLs.  I know.  Hey, last week was my birthday.  I wanted to come up and visit you, but you weren't here, and I wasn't here.  I was in Atlantic City for my birthday.  Oh, hey.  Hey, wow.  Look at that.  You really, uh...  He's my husband.  Oh, yeah.  You and your husband?  You and your husband.  What is a husband?  Yeah, my husband.  Yeah?  Husband.  Yeah, I'm her husband.  My husband.  He went to AC overnight.  Did he gamble?  Yeah, we both did.  When he got married.  We won.  We won.  Crapped out.  I'll bet you she doesn't lose 800 pounds. 
[02:20:00]  I'll bet you she does.  I don't weigh 800 pounds.  Look at Kevin.  It's horrifying.  I won $200.  I won $200.  Do you take this barnacle carrier to be your wife?  And you know what?  The casino.  The casino that we were in.  Gave us a suite instead of a hotel room.  Wow.  I show your initials.  That's why you...  So you could fit in it.  We had a jacuzzi.  Hold on.  Did you have to play blackjack at the 300-pound minimum table?  I don't buy cars.  Hey, where did you stay in Atlantic City?  I think your husband's on the line. 
[02:20:30]  Joe?  Oh.  Joe?  Yeah.  Joe, is this...  Bye!  Is this Marion's husband?  Hi, hon.  How you doing?  This is the Big Ragu.  Big Ragu.  Oh, my God.  Can you see the Laverne, Shirley, Big Ragu?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got to go along with the act.  Hey, Joe.  Joe, I got to ask you something, Joe.  Cameron, maybe he's in the studio.  All right.  Could you please make your wife be quiet for a second, Joe?  Just show her a sandwich.  Okay.  How...  Shut up.  No.  How long have you been married to Marion?  Almost eight years. 
[02:21:00]  Almost eight years.  How is it, sum it up in as few words as possible, being married to this woman?  She takes care of me.  She takes care of you.  I got one.  That's the first thing that came to his mind as far as a marriage is.  She takes care of me.  No, that's beautiful.  I mean, the guy really seems to, you know, they have a nice relationship.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a question.  What's your name, Joe?  It's Joe.  Joe, when you have sex with her, how mad at your penis do you have to be?  No.  I don't get...  I don't have to be mad. 
[02:21:30]  No.  Let me tell you something.  At least I get it.  Joe, when you're saying it, I get it.  Ooh.  Wow.  She all of a sudden became very sexy, didn't she?  Yeah.  I get it.  Yeah.  How do I get it?  Right?  Is she a wild one?  Yeah, I was going to ask her.  I don't know.  Joe, is she...  I'm not saying.  Well, you don't have to get into specifics.  No, thank you, Joe.  You don't want to hear specifics.  I just want to know, are you a very satisfied man in that area?  Yeah.  And Joe, let me just say one thing.  Oh, Marion.  Joe, be very proud of your wife that she did not show her breasts. 
[02:22:00]  She knows I don't.  I know she don't.  But Lady Di did.  She's an idiot anyway.  What do you think of Lady Di?  She's an idiot.  She's an idiot.  Do you like Marion hanging out with the likes of Lady Di?  Yeah, she's all right, but I like to drive her crazy and bust her.  She's...  He does.  How many times have you seen Lady Di just hammered out of her gourd uncontrollable?  Oh, a few times.  Yeah.  Isn't she the most belligerent, nasty drunk?  No. 
[02:22:30]  I've seen worse.  She's not nasty.  It's just...  No, I bet she's...  Well, you never know what they do.  I have seen her at one of our events drunk.  Really?  So annoying that people wanted to kill her.  Yeah.  More than usual.  I heard.  Well, maybe you shouldn't drink then.  Yeah.  You might have a problem.  I don't drink.  You don't drink anymore?  You've given up the...  Not really.  Not really.  No, I think you might have a problem.  No, she has a drinking problem and she won't stop drinking.  She doesn't drink as much.  Well, maybe that's why you're showing your breasts. 
[02:23:00]  She don't drink anymore.  She don't drink any less.  I'm not drinking.  She wants help.  She's crying for help.  She don't drink anymore.  She don't drink any less.  What do you drink?  Vodka and gravy?  I drink water.  Lady Di, you got it backwards.  The object is to get the guy drunk.  Oh, is it really?  Oh, I didn't know that, Anthony.  Thank you very much.  See?  Well, why don't we let Joe go?  All right, Joe, thanks.  Okay.  Thank you for calling, huh?  Okay.  See you later.  Godspeed, Joe.  Godspeed.  Yeah, bye.  All right, everyone's talking at the same time.  Bye.  Do you now picture Joe on the phone hanging up just plowing his mistress? 
[02:23:30]  Just plowing the chick that he's with right now?  He seems like a cool guy, actually.  Yeah.  He seems too cool.  Joe is very satisfied with it.  You think so?  We got a good relate.  Very good.  Why don't we take a break, Ant?  Do you have rich relatives or something?  No.  Oh, okay.  After sex, do you roll around in mud and spit water in the air?  No, do you?  I know.  I know.  Hey, Jim, when's the last time you had it?  Oh.  When's the last time you had it? 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  She getting you now.  I could say when's the last time I had it.  Oh.  Definitely.  When was the last time you had it?  Monday in a jacuzzi.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  I will never again.  Was it meant to be a jacuzzi or were you queefing?  It was the ocean.  She queefed in the ocean.  I don't hear you.  Oh, my God.  You had it.  Wow. 
[02:24:30]  I can't say anything about this subject.  Why not?  Because no one's banging her.  Have you?  Tell Kevin Meany when the last time you had sex was, Lady Diary.  I don't even remember.  No, she doesn't remember.  You blacked out.  No, I did not.  You blacked out.  No, I did not black out.  There's four guys, a pool cue, and a pinball table.  Oh, my goodness.  When is the last time someone grabbed your thin sumo wrestler hair and just really...  At least I have hair, Norris.  Although your hair is thicker than your gold.  What's that thing on your lip? 
[02:25:00]  Hair is horrible.  Huh?  If you haven't had sex, what's that thing on your lip?  Right here.  I told you it's a cold sore.  It's not that bad.  We're going to take a break.  It's not a lesion.  It's a bump.  Kevin Meany in the studio.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  That's right.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Great Kevin Meany.  Caroline's.  Very funny guy.  What, Voss?  Nothing.  Rascal's Ocean.  Rascal's Ocean?  Voss.  You couldn't wait after the break.  I know.  You had to step all over Meany's...  You had to step all over Kevin Meany's blog.  All over Meany's thing. 
[02:25:30]  You're right.  I'm sorry.  And he's not even saying anything right now.  That's true.  Oh, what a handsome man that he is.  Oh, he's showing pictures.  Hey, let me see a picture of your husband real quick.  Let me see.  Show Anthony there.  Marion, quick.  Let me see.  We've got to go to commercial.  I want to see this.  I've never seen a bigger wallet.  If you can actually see the gun pointing at his head.  Let me see.  This is your wedding picture?  Let me see.  Wow.  This is eight years ago?  Eight years.  You have not changed a bit in eight years.  I'm so actually, you look exactly the same. 
[02:26:00]  That's a compliment.  No, you look great.  And the picture he carries of you is in a briefcase?  I didn't know you married Gene Shalott.  Does he look like Gene Shalott?  I can't see him.  Look at him.  What does he do for a living?  He works for the government.  That's what they found on Roswell.  He runs a golf course for the government?  He runs the golf course.  For what government?  Maintenance.  Maintenance.  That's grass.  He does maintenance for the golf course.  Well, I'm hoping to be the head screenskeeper in a couple of years. 
[02:26:30]  That's my schedule to be the head screenskeeper.  It's top secret work at the golf course.  Top secret work here.  I work at the government golf course.  One time, one of these government guys was going to stiff me.  I said, hey, come on.  Something for the effort.  He's been on his job for over 30 years.  Wow.  30 years at the government golf course.  Do you think he ever bangs the 18th hole because it reminds him of you?  Do you know how to play golf? 
[02:27:00]  No, I don't.  Do you ever think about going and doing something?  Never.  I know besides a comedian.  I thought of putting you on your back and trying mountain climbing.  Maybe getting a life?  But aside from that, no.  Like maybe getting a life and doing something?  Wow.  I love exaggerating here.  I love to see you two wrestle.  Wouldn't that be fun, Kevin?  When's the last time you had, you know, any kind of life besides...  The government golf course is killing me.  I love the...  He works for the government. 
[02:27:30]  He works for the government.  That's what I'm going to say.  That's what I'm going to say.  But what golf course does the government know?  I'm not going to say.  Is it in Jersey?  Kevin, it's top secret, Kevin.  Top secret government golf course.  For the government.  He does maintenance work.  For the government.  He does maintenance.  And look at Lady Di.  Lady Di is going, no, don't say anything more.  What is going on here?  If I tell you, then I'll have to tee off.  It's the county golf course.  It's the county government.  And I work for a county, too. 
[02:28:00]  You do?  What county?  Susan's eyes, I guess.  He lines up his last shot.  What do you do for the county?  Oh, we got it on and out.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  What do you do for the county?  You're a street cleaner?  What do you do?  No.  I'm not saying what I do.  She moves tables for the government.  I do.  That's what she told us.  She moves tables and chairs for the government.  I do.  I have a very good job.  I love my job.  I'm sure you do.  Yeah, I do.  Well, look, you got off today to come to the show.  I didn't get off.  I work from 7.30 to 4.  All right, all right.  You didn't get off. 
[02:28:30]  What is that?  Oh, my God.  It's like the government is listening all of a sudden.  I work from 7.30 to 4.  You got off from 4.  I have normal hours.  7.30 to 4.  And you came here after your work.  Yeah.  I go home.  I change.  I get on a train and come here.  Wow.  That's great.  Yeah.  All right, you're not allowed to drive?  Well, I do drive, but I'm not driving in this city.  No.  No way.  No.  We drove here, and we were like 20 years old, and forget it.  Yeah.  Joe, Joe.  We did do that.  Joe, it's time to change the hole on the grassy knoll, Joe. 
[02:29:00]  Wait a minute.  My husband, Michael.  You know, you look at those old Kennedy films.  I see a flag with an 18 on it flying on the knoll.  It does do that.  I saw a golf club head over that fence.  Kennedy was hit with a golf ball.  He does play.  Kennedy was hit with a goddamn golf ball.  We're also talking.  You could tie Mary in and hang her from a cliff by her tail.  I used to work on a golf course, too.  I used to work on a golf course, and I used to play.  Hey, listen.  Is golf course a code word for something?  What's your handicap? 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  I used to play.  Leave in the house.  I used to play like the miniature golf.  Hey, with that, we're taking a break.  Yeah, let's take a break.  We'll be right back.  Yeah, Kevin Meaney's playing Carolines, and we don't know where Rich Voss is playing at  this moment in time.  Right, Rich?  Oh, I don't know.  God.  Kevin Meaney at Carolines.  Very funny guy.  Go see him.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  He's fighting.  Put more in there.  Put more in there.  Christy is being, uh...  Christy's fighting better, which means more.  Oh, my God.  The tank is coming apart. 
[02:30:00]  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow.  That was a lot of fun, huh?  Jesus, man.  Kevin Meaney in studio playing Carolines.  All this weekend in New York.  Yeah.  Rich Voss in studio.  I like the, um...  I like the choice of music.  The Mission Impossible kind of government golf course worker. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, we're always thinking around here, right?  Very mysterious.  Very mysterious, that government golf course.  And she doesn't want to tell us any more.  No, it's top secret, Opie.  How dare you?  Eric, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  I just had a comment.  This is some of the best radio I've ever heard in a long time.  Wow.  You guys are rocking today.  Well, it's so much fun when they're...  It's all Kevin Meaney.  Yeah, it's when Kevin Meaney and the Retard Laverne and Shirley come together. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, all you guys are just tearing them up.  Tearing up the Retard Twins.  I love it.  Retard Twins.  Yo, guys.  I take the long way home just so I can hear you guys, because I live in Mass, and I don't  get the station out there, but...  Oh, thanks, Eric.  Hot damn.  You guys are awesome.  Check out Kevin Meaney's website when you get home tonight.  I will...  Yeah, you should.  M-E-A-N-E-Y.  Yeah, well, after I go to eatabullet.com.  Oh, boy.  All right, and that one's for you, pal.  Thank you, sir, very much.  All right, Eric.  You rule.  Thank you. 
[02:31:30]  Yep.  Hi, honey.  Dude, it smells like grape jelly.  Hey, you guys want to smell something?  It smells like...  It's a cologne.  I'm guaranteeing you it's a cologne.  It smells like grape jelly.  You ever smell like grape jelly?  My friend Sue is on one.  You're cologne rich?  Yeah, it's a cologne.  Smell rich as cologne.  It doesn't smell like cologne.  No, no, no, it smells like grape jelly.  No, no, no, it smells like grape jelly.  It doesn't stink.  It smells like...  It smells like earwax.  No, it doesn't.  It's behind the ear.  Oh, my...  Why are you smelling this?  It's horrible.  Behind his ear.  You know what it smells like?  What is...  What did you...  Where did you put your finger?  Behind his ear. 
[02:32:00]  I'm right here.  For some reason, he's like some kind of a skunk.  He's got like a...  A gland or something going on.  You want to try it?  That's a pustule.  You've got to try it.  Hey, Voss, hold on.  I tried...  I smelled his belly button.  This makes his belly button smell like violence.  It does.  It's stinky.  Just make sure the mic isn't in front of their mouth for a second.  He...  I just got to explain to everybody what Voss is doing.  He rubs his index finger behind his ear and then makes people smell it, saying it smells  like grape jelly.  It's his cologne. 
[02:32:30]  And then they smell it, and it is...  It's some kind of heinous, dead animal smell.  That resides behind his ear.  He says...  He says that he washes and everything...  And for some reason, it smells like a dead animal.  Anthony, this is legendary.  He's smelling it in Hattie.  I always get people to smell it.  I'm like, dude, why...  It smells like strawberry jam again.  You want to try it, Kev?  You want to...  No, I don't want to smell it.  But, you know, listen.  I know, like, you know, if I'll...  You know, like, pick at...  Like, I'll have like a...  You know, a pustule or something. 
[02:33:00]  A pustule.  Or like some goiter or something.  Oh, a goiter or a pustule.  And you'll squeeze it, and the pus will come out.  Yeah.  And then I smell that.  You'll take a whiff of that once, yeah.  And then I'll take a whiff of my belly button also.  Oh, will you?  When I clean that out with a Q-tip.  Make sure it's all nice and clean?  No, I just...  I'll smell that.  And...  But I smell that my own smell.  Why are people so fascinated with their own smells like that?  I don't...  He got some.  He got some.  Did you smell it?  You need to sniff the finger just like around the area. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, God.  Here, you want to...  No, no.  Come on.  Stay away from me.  Stay the...  Stay away from me.  Even he got some.  No, I will not even.  Sticky, how bad is it?  Oh, it's pretty bad.  I wasn't even close, and it's pretty bad.  It's only my left ear, too.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Go to a doctor.  It smells like milk plus Velocet.  Jesus.  It smells like the fertilizer they use at the government golf course.  I didn't know where you had you.  You might have had your finger somewhere during the break.  No, I didn't know.  Was that it?  Did you give yourself a stink finger? 
[02:34:00]  How come you won't take any?  It's behind the ear.  Do you got, like, crabs or something?  Marion, smell his finger.  I don't want to smell your ear.  Come on.  Just...  It's behind the ear.  It's behind.  I don't want to smell your ear.  Just one little...  One little smell.  Come on, Marion.  Give a sniff, Marion.  I can smell it from here.  Be a sport for the show.  Come on.  Be a sport.  Come on.  Be a sport.  You smell it.  You smell it.  I'll buy you a pizza to drink.  You smell behind my ear.  Give it a sniff, Marion.  A little sniff.  Come on.  Let's repeat.  Come on, Marion.  No, go ahead, Marion.  I smelled it.  I got a...  I got a very good sense of smell. 
[02:34:30]  He is disgusting with this.  Come on, reptile nose.  Just stop it.  I smell it from here.  I make my kids smell.  It smells like somebody farted.  I give my kids a dollar to smell it.  Are you kidding?  You are disturbed, man.  You should do that on stage.  You should, like, you know, have people come up from the audience.  Oh, you should do that.  Hey, that's good.  Enough of my acts stink, so I'm not going to do that.  And you will be stinking at Rascals?  Yeah.  I don't want to plug Rascals.  Oh, sure.  No, I'm not a plug.  Why no one else is plugging it you can step on? 
[02:35:00]  Good job.  When are you going to be a Rascals?  Why?  Are you going to come see me?  Sure, why not?  Next week I'll be there.  No, I'm there this weekend.  No, he's there tonight.  I'm there this weekend.  And tomorrow night.  And Sunday.  And Sunday.  No.  No, we don't stop confusing everything.  Kevin Meaney's, Caroline's, Rich Voss's, Rascals, and Ocean Township.  All right.  So you're in a place like it's going to sell tomorrow.  Yeah.  And if you want to see Norton go in front of Edelweiss.  You know what?  So Kevin Meaney could experience the full retard Laverne Shirley?  Yeah.  Ladies, tell Kevin about the peep shows and stuff. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's always fun.  What about the peep shows?  We used to go to the peep shows when we were younger.  You know, we would get stuck here all night.  Like, we missed a train or whatever.  So we'd hang out and watch peep shows for two hours.  What?  You would watch the girls spin around on the tables?  The girls and the guys.  The girls and the guys wrapped up in saran wrap and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Where was this?  42nd Street in Manhattan?  Yeah.  The old 42nd Street.  The old 42nd Street.  And this is when you put the quarter in. 
[02:36:00]  You put the quarter in and then it comes up.  Hey, you know what?  We still go to these things you put the quarter in.  Yeah?  I put $20 in one time.  Yeah.  You did?  What did you get for that?  Yeah, she put $20.  Look at her lips.  Have you ever heard of the glory hole?  The one hole?  Yep.  Yep.  No, I have not.  Father Ritter had one in his confession booth.  Yes.  No, that's...  They're not alive.  You know what's strange?  It was the first time that people doing the sex acts looked through the window and thought  what they saw was obscene.  Hey, did you ever drop your gum on the floor and pick it back up and eat it? 
[02:36:30]  Joe?  I did once.  Yeah, I got like a half a tile.  Did you swallow it?  Oh, jeez.  Do you have to...  Listen, Haitian lips.  Do you have to...  I'm not Haitian lips.  Yes, you do.  So do you, Jim.  Oh.  Wow.  There you go.  These are fighting words.  That's one step away from I know you are, but what am I?  We're that close to it.  I'm fat and you're glue. 
[02:37:00]  Who is a nicer boss, Barnum or Bailey?  Are we going back to this?  Let's go to Johnny.  Johnny, what's up?  Oh, hey.  What's up, guys?  You rule.  All right.  Norton.  Yes, sir.  How you doing, buddy?  I'm well.  Hey, listen.  I know what Marian does for the government, guys.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she's a mascot for the Republican Party.  I'm not a Republican.  I'm a Democrat, honey.  Now, listen.  That thing you put in now is called a vending machine, you fat cow.  Hey, you don't know me.  Hey, so, hey, look.  Don't talk about me if you don't know me. 
[02:37:30]  And if you want to come down here, I'll kick you in here, bud.  Wow.  Why don't you go look in the mirror?  She would do it, too.  Hey, 1920s football helmet hair.  What?  He does know you.  What's wrong with my hair?  Nothing.  If you're a tackle in 1914.  Marion needs the perm back.  Leather football helmet hair.  I am getting the perm.  It's not wrong with my hair.  Wait, your hair is pretty short.  If you've got a perm now.  Hey, Marion, is that where your husband met you, a friar took, in the woods at the golf  course?  No, my husband met me in a bar. 
[02:38:00]  You have hair like Tanner Boyle.  It stinks.  What's wrong with my hair?  Hey, what?  Hey, Yankees.  Show your fat face.  Oh, that's cruel.  Yeah, Kevin.  I understand.  We went too far, Kevin.  It's not my hair.  Nobody don't like it.  Because I think she's wearing a wig.  And I am getting the perm.  I do.  Is that a wig?  It ain't a wig.  Is that a toupee?  No, I just thought.  It's not a toupee.  I have my own hair.  She always comes back in the same thing. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, it is.  It feels real.  It always comes back.  But it's just maybe the way.  No, I wasn't trying to be nice or anything.  Kevin has good hair.  It's not my hair.  But I just thought the way it was on your head.  It just looked like it might be a wig.  But if it's not a wig, it's fantastic.  I'm getting another perm in about a month.  No, your hair looks wonderful.  I do get a perm every second.  But I would just bring it up just a bit.  What blows more than when?  Your hair to stuff under your chin?  Are you a petition?  I work with my wife's hair. 
[02:39:00]  And I also do my daughter's hair.  I didn't do my hair cut a month ago.  So I've actually got...  I think it looks nice.  I do.  Look at her hair.  I love Lady Di's hair.  Thank you so much.  I do.  It's very nice.  You look like Darla from The Little Raskers.  They call that a pixie.  I look like Darla from The Little Raskers.  Spanky dressed like Darla.  Darla?  I used to look like Darla from The Little Raskers.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You sure you didn't mix it up and it was Chubsy-Ubsy?  Oh, Anthony.  Hey, Chubsy-Ubsy.  Don't call me Norman. 
[02:39:30]  Miss Crabtree, Miss Crabtree, I have something heavy.  Heavy on my heart.  You look like Darla when you were a fetus.  No, I looked like Darla when I was five years old.  Yeah, I bet you do look like Darla a little bit.  Darla?  Stinky just clocked Marion in the head with a microphone.  I'll bring in a picture one day.  I'll show you.  All right.  Oh, yeah?  I'm going to hang it up here.  Yeah, bring a picture in when you were a little girl, Lady Di.  Why do they call her Lady Di?  Her name is Diana, and Lady Di isn't so much a name as it is a great friggin' idea for 
[02:40:00]  her.  That's not nice, Anthony.  Lady Di.  Did you love Lady Di?  I love Anthony, though.  Did you love Diana?  I love Anthony.  I love both of them.  Kevin Meany, I don't know.  You like Anthony.  You got a question, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't know about that.  She was a big fan of Lady Di, I guess.  Goodbye, Lady Di.  And who wasn't, right?  See you later, alligator.  That was a very nice thing.  Oh, so long, farewell.  He's got an Elton John song. 
[02:40:30]  Goodbye, Lady Di.  Hey, let's try to squeeze.  We got to squeeze Dice in here.  I do things the old way.  What?  How you doing?  I do things the old way.  Hey, Dice.  Hi, Dice.  I do things the old way.  We got a full studio today, Dice.  No, I know.  I hear what's going on.  It's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Hi, Andrew.  How you doing?  Hey, I hear you.  You're going to get up.  Get up, you fat immigrant.  Hey, hey, Dice.  You pigskin idiot.  Shut up.  You too.  Shut up, retard.  Dice.  I'm not not.  I'm not not.  That's all I hear from you. 
[02:41:00]  Let me tell you something.  You talk about body smells.  I make my own come lone.  You know what I'm saying?  What is it?  What is it?  I do things the old way.  What, who, what?  I don't understand.  Come lone, honey.  Take the cigarette out of your mouth.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Take the cigarette out of your mouth.  Everybody's putting different things out.  Take it right from the sauce.  Hey, Dice.  I spray it into a strainer.  Yeah, what do you spray it?  I let it drain a little, mix it with some toilet water, and I slap it on my neck.  Is that the smell, Dice?  Oh, this is, this is, no, Kevin, this is really Dice. 
[02:41:30]  It's not me.  Hey, Dice, Kevin Meany wants to know if it's really you.  Yeah, what are you doing, Meany?  How you doing, Dice?  I'm over here now with this thing.  You know what, Kevin?  Right up your wrist pipe.  Come on.  Oh, oh, that's.  Shut the fuck up.  Hold on, hold on.  Fuck, I got a little excited.  All right, hold on.  You beeped that, right?  Yeah, we beeped it.  We have no more, we don't have much more beep left, and we don't have much.  I'm not going to, you know I know the way you do that now.  Kevin goes, that's not Dice, he doesn't curse. 
[02:42:00]  You know what I mean?  I changed a lot of my things.  And also.  I don't mean to the whole, you know, the Dice, you know what we got to do?  What?  Forget about the Dice, we got to do the vagina caves.  No, okay.  You know what I mean?  No, I have no idea.  The vagina on ice, because you know how they showcase it?  Dice, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.  You don't know what I'm talking about when they do the ice, and then they, the fag holds  them over the hallway, they're making them these days. 
[02:42:30]  Let's not, Kevin, do you know what Dice is saying?  No.  Yeah, I think I do.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Years ago, when they did things the old way.  Yeah.  If you take a look back then, in all the books like I have.  Yeah.  Of the, you could say vagina on the air, right?  Sure.  In the proper context.  There's different kinds of vagina.  That ain't going to make it.  The way, the way they're building these things.  That ain't going to make it.  What do you mean that ain't going to make it?  You don't describe anything.  You can't describe it.  I'm not, all I'm saying is like Chuck Steak. 
[02:43:00]  I'm saying, they're built to take a pummel in.  We're completely out of dump?  Yeah, we got a little dump left.  We sound like we're underwater now.  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about, uh, this is biological stuff.  Why can't you recite from the vagina monologues?  Right.  The play.  Maybe that would be better for you.  You know what?  Forget that I'm calling it a vagina.  Let's call it, you know.  Too late.  They already know.  No, but let's forget that part.  Remember when I said that? 
[02:43:30]  They could remember that, but let's forget that word.  Oh, this is all going to be in the paper.  No, it's not.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I'm just talking about an event.  Dice, we are so, uh, low on time at this point.  What do you mean?  Sorry?  We're running out of show.  We're running out of show.  We got to go now.  What are you talking about?  We got, we can't play.  What time is it?  We can't play today, Dice.  What do you mean we can't play today?  We got big action events.  That's it.  We got stuff to do. 
[02:44:00]  We can't come out and play.  And we got our other friends from the other part of the neighborhood.  I know, Meany's there.  Oh, I get it now.  I have nothing to do with it, Dice.  I get it now.  If somebody else is there, I'm on the back burner.  If Kevin Meany wasn't giving us the cut sign saying get rid of him, you know, we'd hang  with you for a while.  Kevin Meany?  What, what, what?  Who's Kevin Meany now?  Now you're blaming him?  Let me tell you who I am.  I'm a guest on the show and I'm being paid.  Yeah.  Well, good for you, Meany.  Yeah.  Don't start with me, Meany. 
[02:44:30]  I'm getting after a scare.  I was just going to pump up your gig.  You're going into Caroline's.  Yeah.  I'm going to be in the front row over there.  You're going to be at the Beacon Theater in two months.  That's right.  Very good.  Thank you, honey.  When do I go on sale, slob?  We may go to sale.  Hey.  When do I go on sale, slob?  Tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock through Ticketmaster.  10 o'clock.  All right, Dice, we'll play.  We know that.  You're all in the edge for that.  Yeah, we'll play on Monday.  I got nothing to do here. 
[02:45:00]  If you hang up, I'm going to be all by myself again.  Then whack your bag, okay?  Believe me, it's been done.  It's not up to us.  Kevin's going to hang up on you.  I got it going a little.  I got that, you know, I don't know what you could call it on the air.  Like the pre-putty?  Yeah.  They're going to hang up on you?  Like a nice glaze?  Kevin, don't hang up on you.  Makes a nice pre-put.  I don't want to hang up on you.  I'm going to hang up on him.  I'm going to hang up on him.  Don't hang up on me.  What do you mean?  I'm pressing the button.  Don't do this to me.  I'll press the button if I want you.  Kevin, don't.  Don't you threaten me. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, my God, Kevin.  I did it.  So what, Kevin?  What, is he going to come beat me up?  The Dice man.  That wasn't even him.  He sounded very hoarse.  Yeah, that was Dice.  That was Dice.  And you hang up on him, Kevin?  Well, let me tell you something.  What he was talking about was wrong.  Terribly, horribly wrong.  You're talking about the thing.  He was, and then he wanted to change the subject.  Right.  Talk about another thing, but we all knew that he was talking about that. 
[02:46:00]  So you can't bad, right.  You can't do that.  Absolutely.  He's been in the radio business a long time.  He knows what you can do and what you can't do.  He didn't know better.  He ruined the program.  Certainly did.  Yeah, he kind of did.  Yeah.  I know.  He brought it down.  I think he just spoke for a lot of listeners.  He just brought it down.  He's ruined the program.  He's all right.  Oh, shut up.  I didn't even know they had a Beacon Theater in the Catskills.  Now, now.  Are you going in the theater?  Meany!  Oh.  Is he back on the air?  Meany!  Hello.  Meany!  Yes.  You hung up on me.  I'll do it again.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:46:30]  I'll do it again.  Here we go.  Bye-bye.  That was a big thing.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, God.  Oh, God damn.  Kevin, he'll give you the first one, but now he's pissed.  Now he's really pissed.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Why did you tell me that was the button?  Oh, I mean, I'm with you, you know?  You know, like, all of a sudden, you're telling me, you know, where to hang up on him.  All right.  We're going to wrap up.  But it's funny.  Oh, sure.  And he loves the comedy.  He knows that's good radio. 
[02:47:00]  He's a good sport.  He knows that's good radio.  All right.  Hey, Meany!  Stupid idiot!  Now I hang up on you!  He's always got to get the last word.  He just hung up on you, Kevin.  I don't care.  It's a kid, but we don't.  I'm here.  Oh, shut up.  Kevin Meany at Caroline's tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  We're going to wrap up this mess that we call the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, guys.  I had a great time.  Well, you can...  Oh, I did...  I thought you were saying goodbye to me.  You want to rush out?  No!  Is that it?  What?  I'm here.  What did we do that made him not have a good time this time, Opie?  No, I'm afraid... 
[02:47:30]  I think...  I thought we were this close to asking you to have to a little dinner before the show?  Okay.  I thought we had that kind of relationship now, but now it just seems like...  No, wait a minute.  Hey, I'm gone.  You said you have to wrap things up.  Seems like...  Well, we could stop the fake getting along with each other.  The show's over.  Right.  I got to go.  Got to go.  Oh, well.  Okay.  One day we'll have a Hollywood friend.  Yeah.  Well, he's moving back to New York, so we wouldn't have a Hollywood friend anyway.  He says to me like this, and then he goes and hangs up.  Oh, my God.  Where do I get these guys?  Hello?  Nice.  Yeah.  What is with this guy? 
[02:48:00]  He doesn't like you.  Why do you give him such power?  Has he ever been on the show?  What do you think, are you stupid?  He's so upset.  He's been working out.  We're a little frightened of him.  Look what he's doing now.  I don't like what he's doing to me.  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, Ray?  Bye-bye.  Oh, no.  I don't know what...  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, Ray?  What do you think, are you stupid?  Look what he's doing now.  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, Ray? 
[02:48:30]  What do you think, are you stupid?  Look what he's doing now.  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, Ray?  What do you think, are you stupid?  Look what he's doing now.
