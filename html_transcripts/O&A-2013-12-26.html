<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show’s “Worst of 2013” broadcast, as pieced together from various excerpts, was a chaotic and heavily intoxicated affair.  The show opened with E-Rock introducing a particularly wild episode featuring several prominent guests.  Jeffrey Tambor was interviewed, discussing his acting career, including his roles in *Arrested Development* and *The Ropers*, sharing anecdotes about Al Pacino and his experiences on set.  Mick Foley joined the conversation, a fellow *Arrested Development* fan, gifting Tambor a Santa Claus t-shirt.  This segued into a segment imagining a perpetually drunk Jim Norton, followed by a detailed description of Norton's superhero creation, "Grocery Man," with his unique grocery-related powers.

Courtney Love was interviewed next, joined by Jim Florentine in studio.  She discussed Amanda Bynes, her music industry experiences (including refusing to lip-sync at the Billboard Awards), her relationship with Eric Erlandson (who possessed many of Kurt Cobain's guitars), and Anthony Kiedis.  The conversation also touched on auto-tune and the ongoing discussion about "Grocery Man."  Love detailed a dispute over Kurt Cobain's belongings, accusing the EMP Museum of mishandling and auctioning them off improperly, comparing it to the theft of artwork during the Holocaust. She recounted a bizarre encounter with an EMP curator, discussed the location of Cobain’s ashes, and her strained relationship with Dave Grohl, focusing on financial issues related to Nirvana Inc.  She cryptically hinted at a potential role as a judge on a major television show.

Later in the show, Louis C.K. appeared. He discussed his upcoming season of "Louie," his year-long break, his creative process (comparing it to farming), and a humiliating encounter with Nicolas Cage on a plane.  He detailed the production of his stand-up special, including filming in the round with Alexa cameras and the editing challenges. The conversation included his family life, interactions with fans, and his recent purchase of a 42-foot boat.

The show then shifted to a rant about SiriusXM’s confusing premium channel charges and poor customer service, with the hosts vowing to cancel their subscriptions. This transitioned into a broader discussion of media companies’ frustrating content restrictions and international availability issues, particularly referencing piracy in Australia.

An unexpected in-studio guest, Roger Daltrey, discussed his Teen Cancer America charity, focusing on specialized care for teenagers with cancer and providing the website for donations.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to "Tequila and Donut Day," conceived by E-Rock.  This involved copious on-air tequila consumption by E-Rock, the hosts (Opie and Anthony),  Roland, Denny (a SiriusXM music programmer for oldies channels), and several other staff members and guests.  The resulting inebriated banter became increasingly chaotic.  This segment involved numerous discussions about radio work culture, pay disparities, and the preferential treatment of famous personalities in obtaining radio shows compared to deserving behind-the-scenes staff like Denny, who was repeatedly praised for his smooth radio voice.  The hosts recounted negative experiences with mobile DJ gigs, contrasting them with their current, more relaxed (and intoxicated) broadcast.  Offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic jokes, was used liberally throughout.

"Tequila and Donut Day" continued with additional guests, including Taylor from Cosmo magazine, Dave LaGreca from the NFL Network, and Pepper Hicks.  Discussions ranged from nursing home music choices, trademark infringement, wrestling (Fandango), directions in Long Island,  airsickness, marriage, relationships, and DJing experiences.  A drinking competition ensued, with E-Rock emerging as a heavy drinker.   The segment concluded with multiple individuals highly intoxicated.


Finally, a segment featured a heavily intoxicated guest, "Iraq," who was pressured into numerous tequila shots.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Greg Hughes, reacted with a mixture of amusement and concern as Iraq displayed signs of emotional distress. The conversation touched upon inter-staff relationships, particularly between Iraq and Sam, and salaries within the company. Anthony himself consumed nearly half a bottle of tequila.  Denny provided a somewhat more professional counterpoint to the intoxicated antics, while the hosts discussed Iraq's emotional state, past events, and the contrast between their show’s chaotic nature and radio broadcasting professionalism. Rich Voss was mentioned as an upcoming guest. The show ended with more profane language and disparaging comments, a final song selection, and closing remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shit face buffoonery. E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry. And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass. What the fuck happened?  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  No.  Worst of 2013. Opie and Anthony show. My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you care to follow along. 
[00:00:30]  But the big Twitter is O&A Show. We hope you follow that.  You can also follow us on Facebook at the same address, O&A Show.  And you can also follow us on Instagram at the same address, O&A Show.  Three places, same address. You have no excuse if you can't find us.  Anyway, it is the worst of 2013. So much crazy shit happened.  Big name guests in studio. Stupid people calling in on the phone.  And a lot to get to in the last remaining days here.  On today's show, we're going to go through a segment where Norton explains what he would be like if he was still drinking and hadn't sobered up many years ago. 
[00:01:00]  Also, a story about Grocery Man, Jim's superhero character that he created.  Courtney Love will be in studio.  The return of Louis C.K.  Roger Daltrey is in studio.  Holy shit, how did that happen?  We'll explain a little bit later.  And then we'll take you back, back, way back to the infamous tequila and donut day.  But starting right now, Jeffrey Tambor is in studio.  He's in promoting that Arrested Development is coming back to Netflix.  Well, it already came back. It's on Netflix.  If you haven't seen it, go there and check it out.  We also talked to him because he was with the neighbor on The Ropers, which Jim's infatuated with. 
[00:01:30]  So we talked to him about that stuff going on in his career.  And we discover he has a really brutal sense of humor.  Open Anthony's worst of 2013.  Is that my thing?  What is it?  Oh, my God. You don't recognize it?  It's The Ropers.  The Ropers.  Oh!  My uncle used to play this when he tickled me.  Let's talk more about that.  I think that's a whole hour right there.  Oh, it is. And we got that hour. 
[00:02:00]  Remember that Norman Felt dancing with the plunger?  I love my Norman.  We used to go to lunch the day of ratings on Tuesday.  The ratings would come out and there would be this sweat on his upper lip.  Because I think the deal with Norman was, after a certain number, he couldn't go back to Three's Company.  Right.  And that was...  Norman was an intellectual. Did you know that?  No.  Oh.  Yeah.  Did you, Mick?  I did not know that.  Wait, why couldn't he go back to Three's Company after a certain number of episodes? 
[00:02:30]  Contract.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Those were different days.  How long did you guys last?  I think we did two seasons.  I didn't think we would do one season.  I just said, oh, I'll just do this.  And I didn't know anything about television.  I knew nothing.  But I had so much fun.  Get this.  The same year I did The Ropers, I did Anjustice for All.  Oh.  Wow.  And so there it is.  I mean, the same act it does The Ropers. 
[00:03:00]  No kidding.  That's showing a little range, huh?  Yeah.  Which, by the way, as you were talking, as you were talking about The Ropers and Norman  Fell, I was thinking of your monologue in Anjustice for All.  When you go to Pacino's house and you're drunk and fucking Earl Soames did it again.  I was so nervous.  Such a great movie.  That was the first film I didn't know what a mark was.  I didn't know anything.  I didn't know what an, oh, there's a thing called an apple box.  Yes.  And if you go out of frame, you know, I had my first shot, I had a valise and I kept 
[00:03:30]  going out of frame.  And the guy said, do you want to put that on an apple?  Do you want an apple or a half apple?  And yes, I said, no, thank you.  I'll wait for lunch.  And that's when they knew.  Oh, no.  I'd never done a film.  I didn't know what a mark was.  That's unbelievable.  That would have been so, that would have been a great joke, though.  What?  If you could have played it off like you meant it.  Oh, your uncle called, by the way.  What did he say?  He said, just come on over tonight.  He's dead.  And that's why.  I killed him, self-defense. 
[00:04:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Because it was really, it was very, because it took him a long time to say that.  What was your question?  I just, there's no question.  I just think that would be, that would have been a good joke.  You could have played it off as a joke.  Which one?  He said, I'm waiting for lunch.  Oh, no.  I was too nervous.  You know, my father told me, always ask a question.  I was too nervous.  Thank you, Jeff.  What do you mean, always ask a question?  I adjusted Jeffries' microphone.  And if you have a question, like you say, are we on TV? 
[00:04:30]  Or are we on TV?  Ask a question.  But I was always too nervous, too.  I was always too proud.  You know?  Yeah.  And you got to ask, you know?  I mean, I did not know that when you do a close-up, that they measure it with a, you  know, I didn't know any of this stuff.  Thank God for Al Pacino.  He just took care of me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He knew it was your first film.  Everybody.  Have you done anything as fun in a movie as throwing those plates down the hall? 
[00:05:00]  How much fun was that?  You know, in the Baltimore courthouse, there's still chipped marble.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I threw real plates.  No kidding.  And I went there the day before, and I was a very different kind of actor than I am now.  I rehearsed too much.  I went to the theater three and four hours before the performance.  I was not improvisational.  I worried a lot.  So I was, I actually ruined that movie, which is a very, very fine movie with worry. 
[00:05:30]  I can't watch it.  Really?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  That's a great movie.  The only thing I didn't like about Injustice for All is the music.  I thought the music choices were a little weird.  Like, certain movies have weird music.  Are we asking you for your criticism?  No, not at all.  I was literally.  Are you weighing in?  No.  No, I was always segwaying back into how good you are.  Oh, okay.  Well, let's just, what are some of your opinions?  Have you read any good books lately?  I mean, tell us what you're thinking.  It was coming back to how great you are, though. 
[00:06:00]  Yes, I was just using it as kind of a springboard backing to your wonderfulness.  It was just a little bridge to get back to how great you are.  I'm trying to remember who that was, because it was a very, very big composer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeffrey hated it, too.  I had a problem with the movie, too, but I'm not sure I want to bring it up.  What was your problem?  Oh, my God.  Don't bring it up, Mick.  It's seeing John Forsyth in Bondage Gear, after knowing him.  Remember that?  How great was that?  Charlie and Blake Carrington, and now he's in Bondage Gear.  Do you know what I did not know?  I didn't know what to do on your day off, because, and I would just go to the set. 
[00:06:30]  I did not know.  I did not know what to do with that energy, you know?  It was just very weird.  Can we look up the...  Was it weird for you to be on set?  Can you go online and look up the composer of...  And Justice.  And Justice for All.  How great...  And then, would you check my email?  Why was the music bad?  It was just weird.  It was weird music.  Is it because it doesn't hold up?  No, it's just a bizarre choice.  Or at the time, it was still bad, do you think?  Pacino's running up the street in one scene.  They just didn't need it, right? 
[00:07:00]  Dominic Chienise was in that movie.  He played as...  Oh, he was great.  He was fantastic.  He was a good friend of mine.  Yeah, he was great in that.  Forsyth was great.  Hang a man for armed robbery, Arthur.  How about Jack Warden?  Amazing.  I remember I was going to...  He says, where are you going?  I said, I'm going to Daly's.  And he said, what are you doing that for?  And I said, oh, because I want to check it.  He goes, what if you don't like them?  And I went, you're right.  I never went to Daly's.  Have you ever seen a Jack Warden movie called  Used Cars where you play two roles? 
[00:07:30]  Oh, goodness.  Have you seen him in The Verdict?  Have you seen him in The Verdict?  Yes or no?  I don't remember.  Then forget about it.  He took you away.  I think I did.  The Verdict is one of the great movies of all time.  Did he play a judge?  In The Verdict?  No, he played Paul Newman's sort of a friend.  I did see it then.  I remember the Newman in that movie.  No, you're lying.  No, no, no.  I would never lie to you.  I would rather just be a composer for Injustice for All. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, it's dot, dot, dot Injustice.  And then could you look up Merrill Lynch?  I want to check my balance.  I'd love to know your balance.  Mick Foley's here because he's a huge fan of Arrested Development.  I am.  And I know that's why Jeffrey Tambor is here in the end.  Am I here for four hours?  You can hang for four.  We're not going to be here, but enjoy yourself.  I don't understand.  What am I doing?  Promoting Arrested Development.  I really don't know what you're doing.  You know, I did a series somewhat based.  Do you know about this? 
[00:08:30]  What?  Well, I don't know if I can talk about this.  Can you keep that down?  I mean, I can't.  I'm so bad at that.  It was, what was it?  Dave Gruson.  Yeah, you said that.  You did not.  I did.  I said Dave Gruson.  Did I not hear that?  Yeah, he did say it.  Dave Gruson.  Just before you did.  That's like Danny Elfman now.  Dave Gruson.  I'll nod.  Like, I know who that is.  I don't know who that is.  You don't know who Danny Elfman is?  Of course I do, but the audience doesn't, so I'm playing their part. 
[00:09:00]  The Oingo Boingo guy.  I'm just getting Metallica.  The Oingo Boingo guy.  I don't know.  I don't know if that's how he wants to be remembered.  Why?  He's not proud of the Oingo Boingo, but he's done Batman.  He's done so many great things.  He's done weird science.  He's done everything.  Remember?  Well, yeah, that was pre-  He's the Oingo Boingo guy.  He actually-  What's wrong with that?  There's nothing wrong with being the Oingo Boingo guy, but he's done so many great compositions.  Since then.  Can we get back to Jeffrey, please, and how much I loved when he fucking took his toupee off  and went, hello, Arthur.  Nice day.  And then put it back on like it was a hat. 
[00:09:30]  And there were two endings.  One was Chris Lottie whistling through her fingers like, attaboy.  And there was that ending, which was the original ending that Barry and Valerie wrote.  But, and get this, I just did the Phil Spector story with Al Pacino.  Oh my God, you played Cutler.  That's right.  And Barry Levinson was the exec producer.  That's, this is why God made a circle, by the way.  I mean, unbelievable.  You played Bruce Cutler.  Yeah, I did. 
[00:10:00]  I did just see that.  It was, I thought it was fantastic.  Do you know Bruce Cutler?  I know who he is.  Of course.  Do you ever see him?  Yes.  John Gotti's lawyer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  What did he call you?  He's going to crucify you on the stand.  And that's what Gotti would say about Bruce Cutler, because he was such a good fucking  cross-examiner.  Jimmy ranted about the movie.  I loved it.  I thought it was amazing.  Yeah.  He loved it.  I didn't know, I knew what some of Spector's work.  Yeah.  But to watch Pacino work that, and just see how crazy he was when he saw Ronnie Spector  in it, it was fucking...  And Helen Mirren.  Oh, she was fantastic.  Helen Mirren's in the movie.  Oh, you want to talk about Helen Mirren again?  Thank you.  Would you like to tell Jeffrey Tam? 
[00:10:30]  You haven't seen it?  I have not seen it.  And yet I'm here as a guest.  Yeah.  Interesting.  I'm a fan.  Well, Jeffrey, the reason that you asked me to sit in on this interview...  Oh, yeah, please.  Is...  I'm actually a little starstruck, because I just tweeted out...  Yeah, you never get starstruck, McFoley.  A couple weeks ago, you can go look at the historical record, I said, why am I just finding  out about Arrested Development now?  And I got flooded with all these things.  I didn't know it was coming back to Netflix.  I saw it on a flight to London, and I thought, where is this show? 
[00:11:00]  I knew about it, and even people I trusted told me, it's a great show, you've got to  watch it.  It wasn't until I went to London, I saw this and went, why have I not been watching this  thing all along?  I was just in London, and we were just there, and I had no idea we had the following that  we have.  I mean, consider this.  I know we're goofing around, but consider this.  At 12.01 on May 26th, or 3.01 our time back here, someone's going to press a button, and 
[00:11:30]  it's going to go all over the world.  It's crazy.  That's insane.  I'm going to tell you how much I love Arrested Development, and the guys want to vouch for  me via the fact that I have a t-shirt of me as Santa Claus, which I would like to present  to you, and you can feel free to do it.  Congratulations.  Can I have this laundered, please?  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is the highest compliment I can pay a show.  He loves his Santa Claus shirts, Jeffrey.  Usually, before I go to bed, I will watch something Christmassy to help me get to sleep. 
[00:12:00]  That's so weird.  And in the past two weeks, since I've returned home from the UK, it's Arrested Development  every night.  Wow, that's really strange.  I would have no idea if you watch Christmas stuff to go to bed.  We're very, very proud of it.  I mean, there's 15 of them.  We love Mitch.  It almost approached Newtonian physics to get that nine people together, because thanks  to the show, a lot of us have gone on. 
[00:12:30]  Not Jason Bateman so much.  He's had a tough time.  A lot of us have gone on.  And it's hard for us to get in a room.  So when we were all in a room, it was amazing.  I'm glad you liked it.  It's great.  It's such a good show.  It's honestly the first show in years that I've, you know, when my mom comes over, I'm  like, Mom, you have to watch this.  When my oldest son comes home from college, you have to watch this.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  But more importantly, Christmas shit to fall asleep?  To go to bed?  Thank you, Annie.  We can't let that go.  No, I can relate.  Because before I go to sleep, I think of two things. 
[00:13:00]  I think of my Hanukkah and my bar mitzvah.  Bar mitzvah.  So I understand.  That's weird.  That's also what I think about your bar mitzvah when I go to bed.  And Mr. Tambor, have you ever been in a Christmas movie?  So maybe Mick could see that before he goes to bed.  Yeah.  Well, nothing like, you mean like the Grinch?  Oh, the holiday cheermeister.  Huh?  You were the holiday cheermeister.  I am mayor of Whoville.  Yes, he certainly is.  Yeah.  See?  And then, uh.  Oh, my God. 
[00:13:30]  The weird boner that's happening right now.  Who did you play in MASH?  In MASH?  I played a public relations guy.  I called my mother.  I said, Mom, I'm on MASH.  And she watched it.  And she says, she called me.  And she said, I didn't like your costume.  I said, that is the uniform of the United States Army.  She goes, it's not for you.  That's a Jewish mother.  That was her.  She was worried about her boy.  I know, my son.  Can I ask if you feel free to know? 
[00:14:00]  My son said to me.  Oh, wait a minute.  I've got to tell you, please.  Because he just said it.  And he's working me for an action figure.  He's eight years old.  And I said, I think I'm going to get that for you.  And he said, from the backseat of the car, I said, oh, and by the way, love your work.  I am not kidding.  He's a smart kid.  Is he single?  Yeah.  He's eight.  Oh, I heard.  Give me a call.  What type of action figure was he looking for?  Oh, wait.  You know, he's into Legos. 
[00:14:30]  And these action figures, I...  Any wrestling yet?  No.  Okay.  No.  Does he like wrestling and Santa?  Are you into wrestling?  That's what I...  He was a superstar for many years.  One of the greats.  You know, I've got to say something.  One of the greats of all time.  I've got to do it.  This hurts, Jeffrey.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Because I get this all the time.  All the time.  People say, love your work, Mr. Arkin.  I actually...  And I swear to God in my dad's memory, I recognized you when I walked in. 
[00:15:00]  I swear to you.  I just didn't place it.  It's okay.  Right.  It may have been Celebrity Wife's Rock.  Because I watched porn and I went...  I thought maybe that was it.  Did you recognize me?  We've met.  Have we?  Very humiliating.  Where did we meet?  Well, we've met twice.  We interviewed you once a couple years ago at Comic-Con with the Sigourney Weaver film.  Oh, of course.  I would remember that.  I hope so.  Because there wasn't anybody around.  And do you not remember our moment together?  Let me see that, Jim.  Of course he doesn't.  I look like there's something wrong with me.  What the heck is that?  It was... 
[00:15:30]  You had just done Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross with Alan Alda.  Yeah.  And...  You look good.  Thank you.  I look fat.  No, you don't look fat.  No, you do.  Jimmy, you look like shit.  You look like a corpse.  A bloated corpse.  That was with...  You remember that Sigourney went out in that crowd?  That's dangerous.  I don't...  We interviewed you at a small table.  There was no fans there.  I do remember you.  I remember you.  I do remember you.  Oh.  He's shaking his head.  No.  This is sadder.  This is sadder. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, but Jimmy was 30, 40 pounds heavier.  30 pounds, I'd say, right?  I mean, he was a fat little pig.  How do you lose your weight?  Just the gym and eating better.  Tell them Weight Watchers.  Yeah.  I have no...  Just a lot of hard work.  It is hard.  Yeah.  I used to weigh 270 pounds.  Wow.  Yeah.  You look good.  Thank you.  What are you down to now?  269.  I can't do this.  Great.  Am I?  Yes.  Yes.  What was your...  What was your...  Mankind or just... 
[00:16:30]  Let me ask you this.  Sure.  Is The Wrestler not one of the great movies of all time?  It is a great movie.  Great.  It's a great movie.  It is.  And did he not nail that?  I walked in skeptical and I reviewed it for Slate.com.  They wanted a wrestler's take on it.  And I walked in not wanting to like it.  Of course.  But in 10 minutes, I was like, this guy, he's not doing an imitation of anyone, but I've  seen this guy.  There's so many shades of guys that I've known over the years.  That guy, he's not...  If you want to see something, you must... 
[00:17:00]  And I was there and he did it.  You must see his acceptance speech at the...  Golden Globes?  No, Independent Spirit Awards.  Oh, really?  Okay.  It is the funniest, foulest, offbeat, most wonderful speech I've ever seen.  No kidding.  Wow.  What an actor this guy is.  You know Chuck Zito, right?  Of course.  I've known Chuck from just being around, but Chuck's not the guy who calls me at my house.  And I got a call from him one night and he was like, hey, it's Chuck Zito.  Hey, Chuck, how you doing?  He goes, I got somebody who wants to say hello to you.  And he put Mickey on the phone because I was the first wrestler that he'd gotten feedback 
[00:17:30]  from that wasn't involved with the film.  And he was just really grateful that I thought that he'd nailed it.  I mean, I loved it.  Because he played a real person.  He didn't play a caricature of a wrestler.  He just played a real guy and a father and just a regular struggling guy.  It was good.  I liked nine and a half weeks when I was a preteen.  That explains a lot about you.  That was my first spank, shall we say.  And so to see him, I mean, he definitely changed physically, but it was like the perfect role 
[00:18:00]  for what had happened to his physical appearance.  Do you now have physical ailments because of wrestling?  Oh, man.  What do you got?  He's hurt.  Bad, yeah.  Actually, it was the first time I called Delta as I'm going to Columbus, Ohio, and it was  the first time I ever requested wheelchair assistance.  Bad back day today.  I got out of bed.  I was like, oh, this is not going to be a good day.  I had a very physically punishing style that I chose when I was 19 that no longer seemed 
[00:18:30]  like such a good idea when I hit my 30s.  Not staples, I hope.  Everything.  Everything.  Yeah, yeah.  He's missing an ear.  Yeah.  Are you?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Really?  Jeffrey Tambor wants to see the missing ear?  Sure.  That's pretty cool.  Let me show you the good one first.  There's the good one.  Beautiful.  It's a perfect ear.  Why are you missing it?  It was one of those moves that didn't work out like I'd hoped.  Did it get snagged? 
[00:19:00]  You know what?  I got caught up in the ropes in Germany.  The ropes are a little too tight.  And when I pulled out of the ropes, and I'd had my ears injured before, so when I was  down on the mat, I could see the blood dripping down pretty quickly.  And I thought, geez, the ear's mostly cartilage.  It's not likely to bleed back there.  Oh, man.  And we had this unique situation because our two English-speaking referees had been sent  home.  One because of a knee injury, one due to a death in the family.  We had a French referee who was unable to tell us that he had my ear. 
[00:19:30]  Oh!  He couldn't just show you?  You know what?  I mean, it all goes by.  There's a grainy, there's some footage on the new DVD, like a handheld from Germany.  Oh, man.  That is crazy.  And he actually hands it to the ring announcer who can be seen like literally running to  the back with it.  And we kept wrestling.  That's what I'm going to watch when I go to bed now.  Me too.  I'm in.  And do you want to hear a story?  And this is, I was talking to the guy.  You're going to ask Jeffrey Tambor.  It's his time.  I don't often drop an F-bomb, but I will hear it. 
[00:20:00]  And you have to preface this, but I have to preface this by saying Booker T is a tough  dude in the world of wrestling.  He did some time in jail that he's written about for armed robbery.  And he got into wrestling, tough guy.  And he was on his first overseas trip with the group I was wrestling with.  And he said, when I walked in, this is his first glimpse of me, I walked in, I just lost  my ear.  And I walked in and I said, I think I just lost my fucking ear.  Bang, bang!  Which was the catchphrase.  And Booker T said he was in the corner going, I'm not sure this business is for me, man. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, because you're kind of on that adrenaline rush.  That's what happens after you've been injured.  You come down after that.  But you're a young man.  Are you 40?  40, almost 48, Jeffrey.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Appreciate that.  You do look young.  Yeah, you look good.  Appreciate that.  And now I know people come up to you and say, can you say there's always money in the banana  stand?  A young man came up to me in the airport the other day.  And I said, you want a picture?  He goes, I just want you to do something. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Well-dressed, handsome.  And he said, you have to say, there's always money in the banana stand.  I said, that's it?  He went, yeah.  I said, there's always money in the banana stand.  And he got all emotional and walked away.  So we're talking about a fan base here.  What is that from?  Arrested to rest of the room.  And our pal Patrice was in that scene.  Patrice, what is with you?  Here's my special request.  Without any exaggeration.  I'll do it.  We have referred to my son, Mickey, whose nickname is Pickle, as the holiday picklemeister since 
[00:21:30]  the Grinch.  So if you would utter the words, this year's holiday cheermeister, something along those  lines.  What's the line?  I think it's this year's holiday cheermeister.  We did it perfectly.  But this year's holiday cheermeister.  But I thought you were going to ask me for it, you know, because I have another one that  they shout from Taxi Cabs.  Do you know what it is?  What is it? 
[00:22:00]  Mr. Soames did it again.  They said they'd be fine.  They'd be professional.  But that's fine.  Do you know what it is?  We do not know.  Hey Now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the one.  Yeah.  So I have Hey Now.  I know.  And there's always money in the banana stand.  What's Hey Now from?  Come on.  I was just kidding.  Larry Sanders show.  Larry Sanders show.  And now my favorite Hank Kingsley-related line was actually uttered by Henry Winkler on 
[00:22:30]  the Larry Sanders show, where the Hank Kingsley porn tape had leaked out.  Yes.  Remember that?  And then Henry Winkler, the Fonz leans over to Larry and goes, so Hank's got a tape out  and Larry's really upset about it.  And the Fonz goes, I hear he's got a huge cock, though.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Henry is responsible for one of the biggest laughs I've ever heard. 
[00:23:00]  We were at the DGA screening of Arrested Development.  And if you remember from when he plays my lawyer.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  He, Mitch had him do this take in the bathroom where just before we leave, he looks into the  mirror and he does the take as Barry Zuckerhorn, but he does the Fonz take with the hair and  the audience went, these are adults, right?  They went crazy.  That is, by the way, the nicest man. 
[00:23:30]  Yes.  We say that all the time.  No, he's the real deal.  And I keep looking for the wink, like he's an ass.  Yeah.  Right.  But he's not.  It doesn't happen, huh?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  Now. 
[00:24:00]  That it is.  My name is E-Rock and I'm hosting this thing for the Opie and Anthony show.  Looking back at the year of 2013 and all the cool stuff that has happened.  In this segment here, we check out a couple of segments from our own Jimmy Norton.  The first segment here is Norton talking about what he would be like if he was still drinking  today.  Had he not sobered up all those years ago, we go through what Jimmy would be like, how  difficult he would be.  And then it goes into a segment about Jimmy coming up with a superhero character.  He wants to be a superhero.  It's a little Jimmy Norton segment. 
[00:24:30]  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  My goal is to get Jim Norton to throw something.  It won't happen, though.  I know.  Do you realize that I'm in such a weird...  Today's 26 years sober for me.  February 1st, my anniversary.  Congratulations, man.  But I'm saying it's amazing that I'm in a creepy mood on a day that I should be...  Celebrating.  Because I think all those thoughts come front and center when it's an anniversary, don't  you think?  Yeah, yeah.  You tend to want to sabotage it, but I won't.  26 years. 
[00:25:00]  26 years.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Imagine how awful it would be if one morning we're sitting here and Jim comes in all fucking  drunk.  I'd be like, oh, no.  At this point, he just can't.  But you'd know, because I'd come in late, and you guys would be talking, and you'd go,  hey, and I would just kind of like...  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  That's the look.  The head down, looking like the top of his eyes.  Kind of like, yeah, yeah, private pile on the toilet.  Dude, that is a scary look.  Is that how you look?  And then it's like, Jimmy, are you okay?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Jimmy, are you okay, man?  You feel all right?  Yeah.  Something...  You seem sick or something.  I've just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, that sucks.  I would literally start crying.  I would fucking feel so bad.  I would remove...  I'd give you fucking everything.  Oh, my God.  I would remove myself from the situation.  Oh, God.  I'd run out of this studio.  I would run.  Oh, my God. 
[00:26:00]  Jimmy, have you...  When's the last time I got a fucking thank you?  Jimmy, we appreciate you, obviously.  Fuck your ass.  Your ass.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  Might be sensitive here.  Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What, now?  Now you fucking care?  Where was the fucking caring? 
[00:26:30]  Holy shit.  What have I done in the past that showed that I wasn't caring about you?  Or whatever you're doing.  Who the fuck is Kenny?  Why?  He doesn't give a fuck, either.  Why do you want Kenny, Jimmy?  I want fucking coffee.  Oh, I got it.  I got it.  Oh, he's got his coffee.  The fuck are you filming?  Just because I've never seen you act like this, we're concerned, Jimmy. 
[00:27:00]  You don't give a fuck.  No one gives a fuck about him.  We don't fucking care.  I hate that no one gives a fuck about me.  Ugh.  What do you fucking care?  I think we've proven we care.  Ha!  Yeah!  Fucking!  Where's Gary?  Fuck him!  Were you that guy?  I so...  If it wasn't a big deal, I would love to see this video.  Oh my god!  No!  It would be the saddest thing. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, it would be sad.  I do want to say that, but holy fuck.  Oh, you were not the fun guy?  Look at the look.  No, you're the fucking fun guy, remember?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I don't even want to play act with him.  It's so fucking...  I've seen this in other people, and it's a part of Jim that, like, you can't even imagine.  Well, you fucking act like you never overslept.  So what?  It's 7.30?  I know!  Fucking Dracula called me. 
[00:28:00]  Hocksucker.  Oh, God.  Where were you last night?  Fucking home.  Oh, yeah?  Feel all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  What were you drinking?  What were you drinking last night?  Oh, fucking no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And then the crying start. 
[00:28:30]  Fucking no.  This would be so fucking difficult to sit through.  I would never sit through this.  You all right, Jimmy?  Fuck you.  I'm fine.  You sure?  You don't sound fine.  Yeah, I'm good.  I'm good.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Someone's saying, oh, maybe that's it.  Maybe Fez is drunk every day.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Fez.  Get married.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's getting married. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  You guys fucking care about that?  But we don't care about streaming.  You didn't make any prank calls or anything when you were drinking last night, did you?  Oh, man.  Fuck, man.  My phone was on.  I think so.  Who'd you call?  Scott.  Oh, God.  You talking about the president of this company?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You called him?  What'd you say to him?  I don't know.  It was just...  I was just talking about how he doesn't care.  What'd he say to you?  I just heard, boop. 
[00:29:30]  You hung up on you?  No, I left a message.  Oh.  I don't know if you heard it.  Well, people are wondering.  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck, he's...  Fuck, Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Fucking Mongo?  I wouldn't be able to deal.  No fucking way.  What, is he fucking Mongo now?  It's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show? 
[00:30:00]  Get fucked, Mongo.  Get fucked.  Get fucked.  Look, dude, dude, you gotta calm down a little bit.  I'm calm.  You gotta calm down.  I'm fucking perfectly fucking calm.  They'll throw us right the fuck out of here.  You gotta calm the fuck down.  You gotta calm down a little bit, right?  I'm fine.  You alright?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy.  I thought yesterday was Sunday, so I fucking...  I'm here now.  That happens.  Fucking Tuesday.  Yeah, yeah, that happens.  You just gotta chill the fuck out, though, man.  I'm fine, dude.  They're listening down the hall.  You alright? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Alright.  Yeah.  We understand.  We've had a few.  You could just be happy, though, right?  You could be fun.  I'm happy.  Have some fucking fun.  I'm fine.  Dude, I'm fucking fine.  Why are you...  Why is fucking Lady Gaga getting sued?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That would be something that would really be important.  What the fuck, man?  I don't know.  It's something to do with her old assistant, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  Oh, 26 years.  What?  26 years sober, and you fucking blow it.  I don't get it.  Fucking...  Who adds?  Who fucking counts anymore, man?  Who...  What's the number, right?  What doesn't fucking matter?  Yeah.  You're not gonna drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do. 
[00:31:30]  Fair enough.  Who fucking cares?  You look like you're gonna be sick.  I feel sick.  Oh, no.  How many drinks?  I didn't drink.  You said you drank.  I'm just tired.  Oh, just tired.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm doing the same thing you're fucking doing.  I'm looking for a fucking ending for this bit.  Oh, that was...  The worst part of that is the look.  Oh, I know.  You knew how to look.  Did you look like that? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I was really...  I was a...  Monumentally unpleasant.  Now, of course, that was like an exaggeration, almost like a brewer character, but...  I mean, that does capture...  Were you never a happy drunk?  Never.  Even in the beginning, like, some people, they start out a little bit like a happy drunk.  First drink or two, I was fucking, you know, I was...  I was Charlie Cheery, but then by fucking drink three, I was Dan Dreary, and by fucking  drink five, I was Oscar obnoxious, and by...  I wish I looked like a superhero.  Oh, you do, Jimmy.  You've lost so much weight.  You look so good. 
[00:32:30]  You want to be a superhero.  What kind of superhero, though?  I don't know.  A lot to choose from.  I would just go around helping people.  Yeah?  Yes.  Grocery man.  Grocery man.  Like, if you have too many groceries, I would zip it and carry them up for you.  Grocery man?  He's very helpful.  Like, there's a woman walking, and she doesn't realize that her lettuce is falling out, and  her lettuce falls out of the bag, and all of a sudden, you're...  And I fly, and I catch her lettuce, and I place it back in her bag, and I say, there 
[00:33:00]  you are, ma'am.  And what does she say?  Oh, thank you, grocery man.  Of course.  Grocery man.  I zip away.  Thank you, grocery man.  I fly away.  It's a blurb on page 26 of the paper.  Grocery man.  But meanwhile, I'm flying over and around rapes and child kidnappings, and I'm ignoring  them to help someone.  Like, I'll zip into, like, the Whole Foods, and just as the guy is about to put the heavy  milk on top of the eggs, I just...  I grab the milk out of his hand, and I say, son, look at the bottom of that bag. 
[00:33:30]  And he'll say, oh, grocery man, thank you.  I forgot there were eggs in there.  Wow.  Don't put that on the eggs, I'll say.  And then all of a sudden, I go...  And I've got a plastic bag out, and I put his milk in it.  And I fly away.  Do you bag groceries for old people real quick?  Yes, I do, if they have to do it themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden...  Just like...  The old lady is paying.  Oh, my arthritis is bothering me.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she's looking at all her groceries pile up off that... 
[00:34:00]  Sure.  ...the little conveyor belt.  Yeah.  And then she pays, and then you're...  And all of a sudden, I'm there, and I give her the salute, and all her bags are in the  cart.  Wow.  And I say, have a safe trip home, ma'am.  Oh, thank you, grocery man.  I fly out.  Yeah, and you fly out.  And there's somebody getting fucking robbed in the parking lot.  Yes, there is.  Pistol whipped.  Yes.  The gentleman of color is taking the butt of his gun and caving it into the nose of another  old woman.  But since she has no groceries, I allow that. 
[00:34:30]  I allow that to happen.  Grocery man is the worst.  You have a code.  Yes, yes.  It's about the groceries.  Yes, I'm only here to help with groceries.  Yeah.  Does anyone do well at the box office?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's the one scene where the woman is walking with her groceries, and in slow motion,  you see the handle break.  Oh, shit.  That'll happen, yeah.  And the groceries begin tumbling.  Oh, man.  And meanwhile, I'm somewhere, and you see me look up.  You can sense that.  I sense the groceries are falling, and then I jump out the window, and I change into my 
[00:35:00]  outfit as I'm falling, and I fly down with a fresh bag, and I catch all of her groceries  before they hit the ground.  That's pretty quick.  Yeah.  And I just put them in her bag, and I go, here you are, ma'am, and I take the other  bag.  No littering.  I'm going to fly away.  Oh, man.  That's pretty good.  Yes, it is.  Is there a scene in the movie where something happens to you, and you're not available,  and somebody's groceries maybe fall out of the back of their truck while they're loading 
[00:35:30]  it up?  And it's like...  And then everybody stops and looks.  And they're like, where's grocery, man?  Yes.  You see milk.  It's in the slow motion.  The milk hits the sidewalk, and the milk splatters in slow motion.  Oh, boy.  And everyone stops.  Like, traffic stops, and they all just look at the milk.  And they know Grocery Man is injured.  Injured.  Mama, we have Grocery Man.  Grocery Man, pick up Grocery.  And I'm wearing my...  Pick up Grocery.  My Grocery Man outfit is like a green cape, but it's the consistency of lettuce. 
[00:36:00]  This is terrible.  No, it's not.  Do you have a symbol?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Is there like a grocery symbol when there's trouble?  Yes, there is.  Like, it'll just be a tipped-over bag with items falling out.  Oh, wow.  Is that on your chest?  No.  My chest is a paper bag with two healthy handles and a smile on the front, which signifies happy 
[00:36:30]  groceries inside.  Grocery Man will come.  I fucking hate Grocery Man.  Well, he's helpful.  He's not helpful.  Yes, he is.  He's so not helpful.  Yes, he is.  He flies in a lot of times.  Like, somebody will be going to take an item off the shelf.  It's past the expiration date.  Oh, wow.  And as they go to put it in their cart, all of a sudden, he flies by it, and it's out of  their hand.  What if there are a bunch of bad grocery things happening at one time?  He just fucking is that quick.  Wow.  I go everywhere. 
[00:37:00]  He just takes care of everything.  He's just fucking that quick.  And they go to put something into the car past the expiration, and he snatches it out  of their hand.  Wow.  Do you chastise people for leaving their carts, like, across the aisle when you're trying  to fucking get through?  Yeah.  And they're looking for some stupid shit, but they block the whole fucking aisle?  So there's a great...  I'm telling you the climax.  There's a scene where there's a guy pushing carts, and he's got, like, 50 carts.  But there's a car coming down there, and he doesn't see the cart guy. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, shit.  And Grocery Man flies in and lands right in front of the car and puts his hand up in the  stop motion.  Oh.  And the car stops, and then he waves the carriage guy across the street.  Oh, my God.  What an insignificant hero this guy is.  Yeah, it doesn't even sound like you have a nemesis.  You're just helping people.  Those nemesis are probably E-Rock who wants to eat all the groceries.  No, my nemesis, my nemesis is expiration dates.  Oh, wow.  And poorly packed grocery bags. 
[00:38:00]  That's my nemesis.  There are many nemesis of mine, and I must stop them all in all lands.  I don't think this would gross as much as Iron Man 3.  This would.  Yeah?  I'm putting it head to head.  Grocery Man 1.  Iron Man sticks.  Against Iron Man 3?  Yes.  Grocery Man flies around and helps everyone with their groceries.  Who are you thinking to play Grocery Man for the big movie?  Moi.  You?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  I am Grocery Man. 
[00:38:30]  That's amazing.  Especially with my new physique.  Yeah.  I'd go.  Is there a love interest to get the female audience?  Oh, yeah.  There should be a love interest.  There's got to be.  Come on.  Yes.  She's the only one who knows your identity?  Grocery Man's got a really weird love interest.  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  No.  Her name is Betsy.  Oh, Betsy.  Betsy.  And she has cerebral palsy.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Why?  I don't know.  You don't know? 
[00:39:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Betsy.  I don't know.  I read out of improv.  No, no.  I'll tell you why.  Because he met her because of her cerebral palsy.  She was always dropping groceries.  Oh, and that's something Grocery Man hates.  Yeah, so he just, he began, and he fell in love with her after he helped her.  She dropped another can of peaches.  Why peaches?  Every day.  She likes peaches.  She loves peaches because they're just fun to hold with her fucked up hands.  Yeah.  And she dropped the can on the bone of her foot. 
[00:39:30]  Ah.  And she was like, ah.  And the Grocery Man flew in.  Saved her.  Yes.  Helped her out.  Yes.  Nice Grocery Man.  And then he made love to her violently.  While she laid on her side.  Grocery Man has no ethics.  Her hand, her hand was propped up stiffly like a praying mantis hand.  Grocery Man.  It's not against his, um, his ethics to, uh.  No.  To use his Grocery Man status to get laid. 
[00:40:00]  No.  Yeah.  What he does is, is like when a woman, uh, he takes his lettuce cape and he covers their  face with it and he violently makes love to them.  Violently.  Yes.  It's Betsy with cerebral palsy.  Yeah.  His gal.  Yes.  She's 52.  That's his lowest.  He's an old or late.  52.  52.  52.  Yeah.  It's going to be a hit with all the kids.  This will not fucking gross 10 bucks.  You don't think this will be a hit?  No.  You know what would happen if this is going to be such a big hit that the headline is going 
[00:40:30]  to read, Grocery Man, G-R-O-S-S dance.  Oh, yeah.  For the gross.  Yeah, the big box office gross.  What is the box office gross?  Yeah.  Rotten Tomatoes.  Not in this movie.  Ah.  Ah.  Yes, eh?  Oh, boy.  How did Grocery Man first find out he had these powers?  When he was a boy.  When he was just a baby.  His mother was running around, futzing around, and, uh, something fell off the shelf.  Yeah.  She was making some baby food.  And she went, like, she screams, ah!  Here's the baby food's falling. 
[00:41:00]  And his little fat baby hand caught it.  Oh.  Grocery Man caught it and held it up like, mama!  And she looked all like, oh, my God, you were in the other room.  What happened?  Yeah.  Grocery.  That was his first.  His first word was grocery.  His little fat hand.  Grocery.  This is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.  It's a fucking hit.  No.  It's not a hit.  It is.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's Worst of 2013. 
[00:41:30]  Ah.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  continues right now.  That it is.  My name is Iraq.  Thank you for listening to the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  I hope you're enjoying it.  If not, I don't know what the hell I can tell you.  We'll see if 2014 brings along something better.  In this segment here, we welcome Courtney Love to the show. 
[00:42:00]  Courtney has not been on the show, to my recollection.  But she came in.  Jim Florentine was also in studio.  We talked to her about, well, we didn't really know what to expect with Courtney Love coming in studio.  But of course, we're going to talk to her about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana and Dave Grohl and all those things that she's been dealing with.  But she also talks a little bit about Anthony Kiedis.  And we try to get to the bottom of this rumor that she might be hosting American Idol.  So let's find out.  ONA's worst of 2013.  What do you think of Amanda Bynes? 
[00:42:30]  You tweeted her recently.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  That thing.  I think she likes the word ugly a lot.  Yeah, she uses that for everybody.  It's like, what's that about?  Listen, I was 14.  I was so bloody ugly.  And I thought I was Kate Moss.  I chased this guy named Mark Rennie, who was the hottest photographer in Portland around, convinced him.  I got to show you guys these pictures.  They're so ugly.  You know, I had this big schnoz, and I had like blusher on like this, and I'm wearing white gloves and black and white things. 
[00:43:00]  And I'm like this, like making new wave faces and like voguing.  And I am so fucking homely, and I think I'm in a gap in my teeth.  And I thought I was the hottest thing in the world.  And I was 180 pounds.  Wow.  So if someone calls me ugly, it sort of rolls off my back because, like, it's not about looks.  It's about attitude.  I mean, you get laid on attitude.  But didn't you think that was kind of shitty?  Because you kind of like, you didn't say anything bad to her.  No, what I said back to her is you misunderstood me.  And...  Well, your tweet was, get it together, dude, I think. 
[00:43:30]  No, the first was tweet.  Something like that?  It was just get it together, dude, because it was so crazy.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  The wig and the this and that.  Oh, we love it, though.  And marijuana isn't a drug.  Come on.  And clearly, marijuana is a drug.  Leads to other drugs.  And then there's this whole thing about, like, Disney kids just, like, they're not educated.  Look at how she writes.  You know, I'm not educated either, but I'm at least autodidactic.  At least I try and read Flaubert.  Do you know what I mean?  To pronounce it correctly.  And they have no parental infrastructure. 
[00:44:00]  And they just get, like, after they're not nubile anymore or useful, they're sort of waylaid.  They just lose it.  Yeah.  And then we all pick on them.  She comes up as a little dumb.  And enjoy it.  Well, we love a train wreck.  Yeah, but it's like, don't model your thing on Lohan, man.  Right.  Yeah.  And we do look at it until something tragic happens and then everybody's like, oh, you  know, she should have had help and this.  But meanwhile, everyone was piling on the dog pile like that. 
[00:44:30]  You know, I did the Billboard Awards once and I refused to lip sync and it was a huge  mistake.  Oh, really?  Why?  Yeah, because there's, like, this little delay.  Because I thought it was just, can I say, I thought it was gay without fending my homos.  Homosexual fans, I love you.  I do say gay sometimes.  Okay.  I thought it was just lame.  And we actually sounded worse.  Wow.  Because they were doing AccuTuning back then and whatever.  And I think Kid Rock said something on the Billboard Awards about people that lip sync. 
[00:45:00]  But he's got a lip sync.  We all lip sync now.  Yeah.  On those shows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They sound like shit.  Oh, man.  That's kind of...  But why is it sound like shit?  Why can't they get that sound?  I don't know.  Like, do a sound check earlier in the day.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It does suck, though.  Have you ever heard the Chili Peppers without Anthony's voice AccuTuned?  Oh.  Not going there.  Sorry.  Well, you know, AccuTuned is something they do live.  Is that like...  No, no, no.  They can do it live.  But it's where, if you're hitting flats and sharps, they can...  It rounds it up to where it's supposed to be. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Puts it where it's supposed to be.  It's what they did with Mary J. Blige's voice, in my opinion.  Mary J. Blige had this fantastic, phenomenal, soulful, wounded, great voice.  And lately, what I hear is really AccuTuned.  Yeah.  And it's like, Barbie, where are you?  And have you used that?  For me?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  I'm white.  You know, I don't hear it.  You like the movie? 
[00:46:00]  You like the movie?  No!  You're not going to do that.  But the live shows you do, it's all real.  You don't use any of that stuff.  Yeah, of course.  But Anthony Kiedis doesn't sound great live, huh?  If you take that away?  I would say, without insulting one of my oldest friends who let me use his rehearsal space  before I even had a band, therefore I wouldn't even be here without...  Flee, that Anthony's voice is slightly banal without a little something-something like 
[00:46:30]  reverb or something like that.  Well, when they first started, he wasn't even on key a lot of the times.  That was kind of the way the music was written, too.  And then later on, when they got very popular, it was more of a pop thing, and it needed  to be on key and everything.  Yeah, he was very loose with his being either flat or sharp with a lot of things.  There was like something that was...  There was like a lack of personality for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when you're in studios, you hear people's voices naked, which, I mean, you hear your own 
[00:47:00]  voice naked, it's embarrassing enough.  But when you're hearing other people's voices naked, it's like taking a look at them showering.  Yeah.  I think that's why you can never...  So it's kind of like tattling on it isn't really cool.  You can never really get the impact of what people are going to hear on a record.  You can't really tell what people are going to hear on a record because you hear it as  you're singing it, and you hear it just bare through the cans.  And every time you listen to that song, even through when they're processing it...  Unless you're in love with yourself.  Well, yeah, but who is?  I am.  Are you?  Really? 
[00:47:30]  What happened with you and Eric?  He took 74 guitars from my storage.  18 of them were Kurt's.  They're left-handed.  Jesus.  And then when he gets...  He needs money.  He sells...  He has sold.  Like, Kurt went to England and got all these Marshall stacks.  Like, 7 out of 10 Marshalls are lemons.  So for a guy with perfect pitch, like Kurt, you know, and Miko, who's in my band now, going  to the Marshall factory and getting the non-lemons is a big thing.  Me, I don't give a shit. 
[00:48:00]  I don't have perfect pitch.  Me and Anthony.  That's it.  You know, so anyway, they say hole on one side, Nirvana on the other side, and he sold  them.  Wow.  And then he sold, like, a headstock that Kurt had broke for, like, 100 grand, and, you  know, it's like, there's this guy in BC who collects stuff, and he's a bit gross.  Like, he collects, like, syringes.  He collects pill bottles.  Like, cool.  Paul Allen also has 45,000 plus items that came, that are, like, basically the contents 
[00:48:30]  of me and Francis and Kurt's entire home, and that's a long story, and I don't want  to make allegations against Paul Allen on your radio show, because he's got more lawyers  than I do.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But, um...  Wait, but how would he get that stuff?  I gotta ask you.  Well, I can tell you, but then the lawyers would grow.  I'd have a lawyer.  Because that's potentially a lot of money there, obviously.  Yeah, and the less I talk about it, probably the more, um, discreetly, and it will be to 
[00:49:00]  get that shit out of there.  But you gotta be out of your mind about it, obviously.  Um, I'm pissed.  I'm pissed that, mostly I'm pissed that the guitar tech, who was really sweet and nice,  um, we found out that he has 16, so there's 38, there's only 38 Kurt guitars in the world.  And he has, so Kurt, uh, Eric has 17, we have 12, and then Ernie has the remaining X amount 
[00:49:30]  in a storage space in Washington that he loans out to Paul Allen's museum.  And it's a matter, and he did a deposition in Canada, they got no press, and it's really  a matter of finding out, um, proving that Paul's sister Jody knew about it, because Jody  Allen kind of put it together.  If she didn't know about it, she didn't know about it.  But, um.  How did you, how is it like, it's like, it's almost like in the Holocaust when they stole  paintings and sold them. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  They were eventually returned.  They did it to the Hendrix family.  The EMP Music Project did it to the Hendrix family.  They came to my house, and this guy, Peter Blecka, he's the curator there, he showed me pictures  of things, like I said, needles, spoons, pill bottles, you know, things you don't want on  display.  And asked me, and I answered the door, this is 1998, so he died in 94, so this is four  years later.  And I answered the door in his long johns, Kurt's long johns, he goes, oh, you're wearing  artifacts.  I'm like, no, I'm wearing my dead husband's clothes.  Oh my God. 
[00:50:30]  Dude, like what?  And then he wanted a bunch of stuff, and I figured Paul is really rich.  I'm like, okay, give me a foundation.  I'll give you some stuff.  And they weren't playing ball.  And then I put everything in storage with my name on it, so it said Courtney Love, which  is like a big fucking red flag.  And then sometime in 03, the name got changed to a corporate name, and it went in arrears  after 90 days, and they did an auction, a public auction.  Wow.  Oh my God.  But there's a good part to it, which is somebody was so stupid, they left their real name. 
[00:51:00]  Uh-huh.  So were they saying you weren't paying your monthly storage bill?  Yeah, they changed it to a corporate name.  And what was the monthly storage bill?  Like what was it?  It was a couple hundred bucks a month.  Fifteen hundred bucks.  A month.  And so for that, they changed it.  And so whoever this person is paid something like fifteen hundred bucks for 18 holds.  Wow.  And got everything.  And Frances asked me recently for this chair of her dad's, and I'm like, I don't have 
[00:51:30]  it.  Oof.  It's an experienced music project.  So...  I don't see that on Storage Wars.  We'll see how that goes.  No kidding.  I'll be a hell of a storage.  That one opened.  Well, it's amazing how Bobby Fisher, the chess player, he had stuff in storage, valuable  stuff, and somehow somebody else got a hold of it, and it was like, that's your personal  shit.  They put your name into a corporation, and they go three months without paying it, then  they put a little teeny ad in like Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, that says you are going to have 
[00:52:00]  a sale, or, you know, Acme, LLC, Woodside 944 is having a sale.  That way your name's not on it, so nobody comes.  No, your name's not on it.  So no one knows what they're selling.  Of course.  And only one person, a sale.  I understand.  I understand.  Wow.  And they take it all back to Washington.  That's sleazy, man.  Who has the...  And it was in Anaheim, California.  Who has the Lead Belly guitar?  You mean the Nixon now?  Wasn't...  Didn't Kurt get a Lead Belly guitar?  He did have one.  I don't know where it is. 
[00:52:30]  Ernie may have it.  The last guitar I played on Unplugged, Frances Wants, so she wants to keep that.  Who has that?  That's an art pack.  I have that.  Oh, you have that.  Frances and me have that.  Who lives in the old house?  What old house?  In Seattle, yeah.  The old house that we lived in?  Yeah.  This Microsoft lady who doesn't win the little kids that come next door for their pilgrimage.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's got to be.  It's a really waspy neighborhood, too.  That's why Howard Schultz, Starbucks guy, had a...  He pulled a 1901 easement on me so I couldn't build a driveway because the city of Seattle 
[00:53:00]  picked on him and then he charged the city of Seattle with anti-Semitism, hired Rogers  and Cowan, da-da-da.  And our kids...  His kid was the same as his Franny and he wouldn't let her play with him, which I thought was snotty.  And he had built his driveway like seriously two inches onto this thing, Verena Park, but  it's so waspy and it really is an anti-Semitic town.  Really.  If you don't like Jews, you don't like show people.  That's a rule.  So I remember going into this meeting, it's all these wasps and it was the Friends of 
[00:53:30]  Verena Park.  And if you look at pictures of that thing, I mean, every day they have to take the, you  know, every whatever month they have to take the bench down because people write shit on  the bench because his ashes aren't anywhere because no graveyard in Washington that's in  the Willamette Valley will take his ashes.  That doesn't sound right.  So it's a suicide's a felony in Washington.  It's actually in some states it's considered mental illness, but in Washington state for  insurance reasons, because lobbies tend to make a lot of laws, suicide is a very, it's 
[00:54:00]  very high.  It's very high by men with guns.  And so the insurance lobbies made it into a felony.  So you can't, so there's no life insurance.  She collected on a lot of stuff too.  That's it.  So where are the ashes?  It took me by the way.  I have a lot of them.  Oh, you split them up a little bit.  I split them up with this mom, yeah.  And, and so she has them in this Tibetan stupa.  And then there's some under a willow tree that we don't know what to do with the bloody 
[00:54:30]  willow tree though.  Cause she's moving out of that house.  Oh shit.  So dig it up.  But I don't want to give it to Paul Allen until we straighten this little mess out.  So how, dig up the willow tree and bring it.  Yeah, put where?  I don't know.  Central Park.  How do you do that?  Yeah, it's hard to carry a willow tree.  Put it in the back of a top.  Willow trees are really delicate.  I'll take it.  No, you can have an arboretum guy.  Be very, very delicate.  I understand.  But if you're going to leave it there, we'll take it.  No, we can't leave it there.  It's got a beautiful house. 
[00:55:00]  You want the willow tree?  I don't think I could use a willow tree.  I think it should be like a public willow tree.  I think you're right.  But I don't know.  I don't want to do that Yoko Strawberry Fields.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  It's not really me.  No.  At least Strawberry Fields is kind of protected.  You want it to be somewhere public that can be watched.  Cause somebody will take it.  Yeah, that's why I thought of Paul Allen.  Because he sort of owns, what's he saying?  Oh, I don't know.  Now I want to make sure that this whole Experience Music Project, which is that museum thing, 
[00:55:30]  is clean and that my stuff isn't there.  Right.  So in order to do that, there needs to be dialogue.  And there needs to be dialogue between lawyers.  And as Shakespeare said, first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.  One other question, because I think you've got to go.  Yeah.  Where are you at with Dave Grohl these days?  I don't know.  I talked to Pat Smear a little while ago, about two weeks ago.  Pat was the only other person in LA that could not drive. 
[00:56:00]  And he was also really happy.  And when Kurt wanted somebody in his band that was happy, he wasn't that great a guitar player,  but he was fucking happy.  So I said, I know this guy that's really, really happy.  And he was working for minimum wage at the SST Superstore with my first husband, Pauline James.  And Pauline James said to him, if you join that band, you're selling out.  Wow.  No kidding.  Yeah.  This guy was a tranny that I married in Las Vegas.  It's an annulment.  Holy shit.  A whole backstory thing.  It's in my wiki.  Who knew we had so much in common to my wiki? 
[00:56:30]  We all do it, right?  Of course.  Courtney Jim is in the tranny, so that's what he's saying.  Really?  I married a tranny in Las Vegas.  Oh, wow.  It was funny.  No.  I came back to the club lingerie.  Peppers were there.  L7 was there.  Gun club guys were there.  I said, I just married Pauline James.  And no one laughed.  Really?  If these people aren't laughing, I did something bad.  Oh, man.  And then I didn't have money for a lawyer for like a year, so it took me a year to get an  annulment.  He was really into pantyhose. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, of course.  So when Kurt called Pat at the SAC Superstore, Pauline James was there, he's like, if you  join Nirvana, you're selling out.  So Pat to this day is in the Foo Fighters, and he said, you know, every time this shit  comes up, Dave says, I have nothing to do with it.  He goes, you know, have you ever thought that it could just be the lawyers?  And that actually is food for thought.  But when I went on Howard and I said, many years ago, I said, I'll have lunch with him.  He went on Howard, and he was like, you know, basically fuck her. 
[00:57:30]  So it's not a Yoko thing about us.  What it is, is it's not even a dislike thing.  On my end, it's that, first of all, I had absolutely no awareness of how big they were  until a few months ago when I bought my guitar player a Telecaster, looked up a guitar center  and saw what I thought was the Super Bowl.  It was a Foo Fighters show.  Holy fuck, they're big.  You had no idea?  They're huge.  Arenas.  We all know that.  Big arenas.  But how did it take you so long to know that?  That's not even the point.  The point is, is that there's a financial issue with like money market accounts, pension 
[00:58:00]  plans, da-da-da-da, under something called Nirvana Inc.  that doesn't include Francis, and I need to get to the bottom of what that is, and maybe  it's just lawyers, because lawyers are hacks in rock and roll.  So, you know, but I'm so sick of lawyers.  I just want to play rock.  TV has never been my thing, particularly what we call reality TV or whatever, and this isn't  like some E!  channel, Courtney's life thing. 
[00:58:30]  What TV show is it?  I can't tell you.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Because it's a network thing, so it's a big thing.  Is it something that's already on, or is it brand new?  No, it's already on.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at that.  Maybe like, you know, American Idol.  I can't say.  I just can't say.  A judge or something.  I just can't say.  A judge on American Idol.  I just can't say.  That's a big gig.  I just can't say.  Wow, you're going to be on American Idol.  That's great.  That's a great gig.  I did not say that.  That's a great gig.  Wow.  American Idol.  We got a scoop today.  This show is looking for, I read the demographic thing they're looking for, is 
[00:59:00]  disaffected, I love that word, disaffected females and homosexuals, and therefore, there  is only one person to call.  That would be me.  Wait, so what show?  The voice?  No, I get the cutters.  It still could be American Idol.  That is true.  What happened to my mic?  It's on.  It's on.  No, you muted me.  No way.  You're silencing me.  No.  Are you headphones?  You're silencing me.  Where?  You hit your headphones with your name.  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  Opie.  Anthony.  So American Idol, that's a great gig. 
[00:59:30]  I did not say shit.  Is it that or the voice, I'm saying?  Yeah.  Okay.  I couldn't get on the voice if you paid.  I mean.  Oh.  Okay.  It's not the voice.  It's not the voice.  But she's not saying no to American Idol.  I'm not saying anything.  American Idol, they're knocking everybody out, too.  What's the dance show?  Dance with the Stars?  Dance with the Stars.  Because, you know.  Woo!  Whoa.  Because my, because I'm sorry, my pole work gives me so much, you know.  I enjoyed that greatly that you just did that.  Capacity.  Did you have the goods covered up? 
[01:00:00]  They're covered up.  All right.  They're covered up.  Yeah.  Yeah, with a thin strip.  With a thin strip.  A very thin strip.  That was a hit.  She's not denying American Idol.  No.  They're getting rid of everybody.  They really are.  That'd be a great gig.  That would be a good one.  They like someone that's outspoken.  Yeah.  A little outrageous.  Yeah.  They like that on the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd be perfect for that show.  You'd be honest.  Yep.  She's not saying a word.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ooh!  Rumor has it.  Rumor has it.  That's how it starts.  Well, it's been too soft because nobody's been honest on that show for a while. 
[01:00:30]  And you need that.  I mean, don't you think like badasses are supposed to go on there and be badasses and  then they go on there and there's butterflies flying out their auses?  It's like, come on.  Yeah.  You know, Tyler, even like, he was nice.  They were overly nice.  Well, your buddy there, Howard, he is a bit soft on some of the acts.  I guess you can't just wheel in there and go like...  He's mellowing out, though.  Yeah.  You can't just go in there, though, and be like...  We just had a total Grace Kelly to, you know, we had a totally non-controversial, fantastic 
[01:01:00]  discussion.  Yeah.  I hope I get invited back.  So you think that on the show you'll be more outrageous and you'll speak the truth if  someone's bad?  On American Idol, you can't say.  I didn't say what show it was.  I'm not saying.  I'm just saying whatever show it is.  In general.  Whatever show you're judging.  Whatever show it is, I shall speak the truth.  Right.  So if someone's lip syncing or all that stuff, you're going to call them out.  I did the Billboard Awards once and I refused to lip sync and it was a huge mistake.  And I'm sorry about our misunderstanding about shock jocks.  No, it wasn't a mistake.  It was nothing.  No, it was nothing.  See, it wasn't shocking. 
[01:01:30]  My fuckas.  Courtney, right, this interview wasn't shocking at all, right?  That we didn't...  Yeah, we weren't bothered by it.  I know, no.  We just wanted to get to the bottom of it.  That's all.  We were cool all the time.  Look, we're just happy American Idol.  That's friggin' awesome.  Congratulations on the American Idol.  I never fucking said anything about American motherfucking Idol.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013 continues next. 
[01:02:00]  This is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Yes, that is so.  It is the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock.  And in this segment here is the return of Louis C.K. to the Opie and Anthony show.  Louis, right now, is in the middle of filming season four of his very popular show, Louis on FX. 
[01:02:30]  I think it's moving to FXX.  I'm not 100% sure.  You'll have to look online and find out that information for yourselves.  Anyway, he's filming Louis.  We're trying to find out when it's actually coming back.  I believe it's coming back in May.  Anyway, he's giving us updates about his boating adventures.  Of course, you know he has a boat.  Filming his new special that just came out.  And he also has some issues with our own Sirius XM.  Opie's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  What about the old TV show there, Louis?  When? 
[01:03:00]  Come back in next year.  Next year?  May of next year.  You just decided, bah!  Taking you off.  Nice.  Everyone else does it.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, that's a hard show to do in all the jobs I do on it, so I kind of was starting.  I felt like the last season was good, and the next one would not be.  I feel like I'm on the precipice of a bad season.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  And so I thought, maybe I could take a year off and spend more time.  I'm not taking a whole year off.  I'm going to spend more time making the show. 
[01:03:30]  So I start work earlier.  But I had to hit a reset button.  And also, the shows, even though the show's not seen by that many, it's still a small  show, you know?  It's the frenzy about it and the awards and all that stuff.  Yeah.  It wasn't good for the health of the show to me creatively.  I needed a year off from that.  Wow.  Yeah.  In order to keep doing the show right.  That takes balls.  Did you get any flack from the people that want you to?  I mean, they're building like a whole thing. 
[01:04:00]  The show started kind of a whole comedy thing for them.  And then I had lunch with the president of the network.  Yeah.  He didn't know why.  I'm taking him to lunch.  And he's just, we're both having a great lunch.  And I'm like, here, I'm about to make his face change.  It's a weird feeling.  Oh, man.  So here's what I was thinking.  Oh, boy.  And you don't want to, leading up to it, and I'm seeing his, behind his eyes going,  what does this mean?  And so I kind of got, so what I'm saying is I need to take a year off.  And then I watch him take that.  And he's a really, you know, courageous and great guy, John McGrath. 
[01:04:30]  So he, oh, okay.  You mean in the show, your character is going to take a year off?  So we're doing an episode about taking a year off.  We're doing an episode where you're taking a year off.  I love it.  I love it.  No, no, see?  Yeah.  But so I got to do it.  Yeah.  You should have given him a worst option first.  Yeah.  Like, you know what?  I don't want to do the show anymore.  Yeah, I kind of want to quit and just get out of the business.  I'm tired of it.  What?  All right, maybe I'll just take a year off.  All right, fine.  Also, I had no idea.  You don't know what these people.  It might have been that he would have said, maybe you shouldn't come back. 
[01:05:00]  He might have said, don't you know, who knows?  They play their hand.  So it was tricky, but they were really supportive about us.  I want to bring it back as a musical like cop rock.  Yeah.  And then they go, no, I'll take a year off.  Yeah.  And I'll have some ground to make up.  People won't care as much, and the network won't care as much.  I don't know.  I think it'll be a tremendous, like a triumphant, not triumphant, but like coming back.  Like the Sopranos took over a fucking year every time.  People take years off, and when you do it, it feels like this thing.  But then once it's over, it doesn't feel like anything to anybody. 
[01:05:30]  Nobody cares anymore.  It's just television.  So it's not like I'm the police department taking a year off.  It's just a fucking TV show.  We just feel like we need a little, we're going to do something else for a year.  So everybody, just good luck.  Try to be good to each other.  Keep your doors locked.  Call the fire department if you really need somebody.  No, they took a year off too.  But now I'm really hungry to get back, and I miss it a lot. 
[01:06:00]  So I hadn't felt like that.  Are you writing, though, during the off time?  I'm trying not to write at all.  You're trying not to just do anything.  Not even think about it.  As far as the show goes.  It's a thing I've learned to do, is to think like a farmer or something.  Like just take, don't rip the shit out of the ground yet.  You've got to rotate your crops and keep the soil or you'll have a dust bowl.  But being a creative guy, doesn't something pop in your head?  You're like, oh, wow, that would be a great episode. 
[01:06:30]  If I have a germ of an idea like that, I email it to myself with a heading show idea.  So I have a bunch of those.  And then just leave it alone.  And then I leave it alone and don't develop it.  And then I've been concentrating on the stand-up.  It's something I learned about sharks at an aquarium with my kids.  Sharks can't stop moving.  You know why?  I only kind of figured around.  They don't have those moving gills parts.  They don't have moving gills.  They can't push water.  They need the actual water to go in their mouth and out their gills, so they've got to keep moving forward.  It would be like if you didn't have lungs that expand and you needed to just walk and have air come in. 
[01:07:00]  If your leg motion controlled your diaphragm.  You'd have to bend over and run to get air to come in.  What a horrible design.  Oh, to put fucking air in your mouth.  Like a scoop.  Like a hood scoop.  Sharks suck.  So they're really dumbly designed.  So even if they stop moving for a second, they start choking.  Yeah.  So, but they need to sleep just like every neurological thing needs to sleep.  So they sleep their brain in sections, in quadrants. 
[01:07:30]  They sleep like a quarter of their brain here.  It's like Jimmy.  A quarter of their brain.  There's stuff you can catch.  Sometimes you'll be able to see a shark.  I mean, I've never seen a shark, but you could happen upon a shark who's asleep.  Yeah.  And he doesn't, he's not looking at you.  He's just only doing motor skills, whatever it is.  And then he wakes up.  Would he go right by you if he was sleeping like that?  I don't know that much about it.  I just want, there's only one follow-up question.  He might.  Let's go.  Let's get nudged him.  Could you put sleepy shark in the Google? 
[01:08:00]  I want to see this video of a sleepy shark.  Okay.  So, so I figured out, I had this idea.  Okay.  If you sleep certain sections of your brain, like you just shut down.  Cause I do all, I'm always overworked.  So I thought if I just don't, if you have the discipline to not think about certain things,  to not use certain, like don't do any logistical scheduling stuff for like, you know, several hours.  Don't even think about it.  Only think about this thing that you're doing and then you swap it out.  So the show is gone from my head for like this whole several months. 
[01:08:30]  And then when it comes back, it'll be very rested.  But meanwhile, I've been doing a standup special.  I'm working really hard, but not at the show.  Don't you feel like I'm always afraid if I get an idea and I don't write it immediately,  that I'm going to look at it the next day and hate it.  Like I go back over certain ideas and I'm like, oh, you fucking stink.  Like if I don't write it out in that moment, I panic that I won't feel that same emotion for it.  Some stuff is like that, I think.  But I don't write properly like for a standup unless I'm on stage.  I can't come up with stuff.  So I don't, and I avoid thinking about that until I'm going to be on stage. 
[01:09:00]  So you don't want to see my notebook in parentheses where I say funny face.  It would be a struggle like if some guy coming up with a new show found Louie's email  and all these ideas from Louie's email.  This show's great.  Critically acclaimed.  Oh, it sucks.  Louie's got the big HBO special coming out.  That's exciting.  The fucking posters are great, man.  I saw the bus picture and I saw the one in Times Square.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, it's the first time I had posters ever.  Really? 
[01:09:30]  Really?  My show, they never did.  They call it an outdoor.  I just found out that they call it an outdoor campaign because I never had one.  No, my show doesn't have posters or anything like that.  So this is the first time I've done that.  Did you have any say in the poster?  Yeah, yeah.  They showed me a bunch of different things.  Yeah.  And I picked that one.  Because it is really good.  I notice it when I'm driving.  You cannot look at it.  On the subway entrances, they got those things.  So when I'm driving on the road, I see them and they're very like, what the hell is that?  It's like, why would someone place so much room?  Yeah, there's a lot of white.  And then I'm tiny in the thing.  That's what I like about it. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, you're just in the bottom.  All this white behind you.  It's fucking great.  It's very cool.  Who would present that and think you wouldn't say, you're wasting so much space?  Like, that's how dumb.  I have no clue.  Because obviously it works.  HBO has a great design department.  I don't know.  No, it was really smart.  No, you need a lot more shit in there.  See, I would have put a bunch of redheaded guys and then had him shake and put his hands  up like, ah, what the heck?  Ah, what am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  I guess I'm just one of these kinds of guys.  Kinds of guys.  Hey, that's a good idea.  Can I steal that? 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to use that as a promo on my next show.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, but you can't not look at it.  All that white and just you at the bottom.  And I first saw it on a bus and I was like, that is fucking great, man.  Yeah.  I just hope the special doesn't suck.  No, come on.  I'll find out on Saturday.  I'm sure it's good.  I saw the moment of it.  Yeah, but that's what everybody said about every shitty special ever.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure it's great.  Ah, it's got to be good.  It could easily suck.  It's totally possible that it sucks.  Well, the managers or friends have never said that about a special.  Like, I shot a special.  Yeah, it's probably shitty. 
[01:11:00]  It probably stinks.  Jimmy just filmed his in Boston.  We went up there for that.  How did it go?  It went really well.  Summerville Theater?  Yep.  You actually made me feel better because I was so panicky about the fucking lack of smoke.  And I asked Louie.  Because that's what they do is to get lighting a certain way.  And I'm like, dude, I can't use smoke.  And he's like, I've never used it.  It's so stupid.  Never used it once.  And that actually is the only thing that made me feel better.  I meant to write you and tell you that.  The only thing that made me feel better about it was him saying that.  Well, that's because the people that are into the photography of those things, they fill  the room with smoke so that it has more atmosphere. 
[01:11:30]  And it's a giant waste of money.  It's stupid.  And you know, the look it gives doesn't mean anything, right?  Doesn't mean anything.  I never did it.  I've done five of these now.  Never did it.  Well, Nicolas Cage gave you some advice, too, about the smoke, didn't he?  Oof.  No.  Eww.  I don't know that part of our business.  He just blew me off completely.  He was on a plane.  Sitting right next to Nicolas Cage.  Sitting right next to Nicolas Cage.  Yeah.  Trying.  And you asked him if you should use a smoke machine?  I was just saying.  Here's what that was.  Louie's fucking laughing his balls off of Jenny's dumb question. 
[01:12:00]  Believe me, I would have had more respect for myself if I asked Mohamed Atta that on a plane.  You've got to give him the short version of the whole story because it's amazing.  I know it.  I already know it.  Of course you know.  Hey, I'm a big fan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, you're really great.  Yeah, thanks.  I'm a comic.  I don't know.  No, I guess so.  Yeah.  I think I kind of know who you are.  Yeah.  Listen, can I ask you a question?  Well, yeah, I guess so.  And then he finally has to take off the headphones, Nicolas Cage, and face you.  Now he has to take off the headphones and face you. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.  I'm doing a stand-up special.  I'm not sure what that is, but go ahead.  Should I use a smoke machine?  I don't know why you're asked not.  I'm an actor.  Louie was on the plane.  I don't know why you would ask me that.  No, Louie just made Nicolas Cage like me a lot more than he actually did.  I wish that was the story.  He actually would have acknowledged me.  Wow.  It was just humiliating.  Why did you ask Nicolas Cage?  Why did you ask?  Because I'm a small man trying to make a connection with a movie star.  He was trying his best to get into a conversation. 
[01:13:00]  And before he said anything, and there were like three or four or maybe even five attempts  at this conversation cross-country.  And before each attempt, Jimmy would play out the scenario, and it would always end with  Nicolas Cage going, yeah, here's my number.  Get in touch with me.  And it always ended with just, huh?  Huh?  It was a fucking five-hour humiliation slash validation of what I already know.  It was truly amazing.  And you were just trying to get a picture, and you didn't get the picture. 
[01:13:30]  No.  I got an autograph, but.  He finally gave me an autograph.  But you shot in the, I saw a clip on HBO shows, like, what's coming up, and they fucking,  it looked amazing, because you shot it in the round in the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix.  Yeah, the Phoenix.  You went in the round.  Yeah, Carlin shot a special in there in 77.  Oh, yeah.  And it's beautiful.  And the room is exactly the same.  It's never changed.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so I got, it was about 2,800 seats or something, which is just what I've been doing.  Right.  And also, I'm just sick of this same thing of, like, there's the guy with, 
[01:14:00]  the curtain or whatever fake set.  And then you kind of come around awkwardly behind him, and you see the crowd in the distance.  And I don't like lighting the crowd.  So this way, they're all around.  They're just all around you.  And the crowd is a backdrop.  Like, everywhere you see me, you see people fuzzy in the background.  Just a fuzzy kind of.  It's like a cartoon when they show an audience in a cartoon.  The background.  Yeah, yeah.  Just smoshy.  Fuzzy colors.  But how did you feel on stage in the round?  Isn't it?  I loved it.  I did it.  Is it vulnerable, though, a little bit?  It's just totally different.  I did it in Hyannis. 
[01:14:30]  They have the melody tent.  Right.  I've done the round a few times a year for the last few years.  I've used to it, I guess.  And then it's totally different.  It's a thing where the audience, you're always facing somebody, and you walk in a circle.  It's more natural in life to make spirals and circles than straight lines.  Yeah.  So if you just give in to it that way, it's really cool.  I've only done it a couple times, and it takes a little getting used to, though, because you're always like, I've been facing my back too long.  Did you start thinking that way or no?  Well, yes.  That does.  A clock starts ticking. 
[01:15:00]  As soon as you stop moving, you feel this heat burning behind you.  It's like being a rotisserie chicken, and you stop the rotisserie.  But the stage is moving, right?  Is rotating?  No, no, no.  Some places do that, but on the show, that would have looked retarded.  Oh, yeah.  Radio City.  Not Radio City.  Fucking Westbury.  Westbury does that.  I saw Bob Saget in the round, and the stage, and Dice, and yeah, the stage slowly moves.  Yeah, you can't film that.  No, you can't, and the thing I learned, because I did a show in Sacramento the same week, they have a round theater there.  I did that just to get used to it. 
[01:15:30]  There's a few things, like when you're on stage, in a regular stage, you want to come up to the audience, to the lip of the stage.  But in the round, the closer you get to the lip of the stage, you're eliminating more and more people.  If you're standing on the lip of a stage looking out at the audience, you're looking at maybe 20% of the audience, and 80% of them are now behind you.  Wow.  So the only place to be is either on the back, like standing on the lip of the stage with your back to the, you know what I mean?  Right.  But you're actually facing more people.  That would make sense.  Yeah, you're on the lip of the stage.  Now, if you turn around.  Yeah.  And face the center of the spindle. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  Now you got the whole audience there, except for, you know, who's right behind you.  That's right.  There was a guy, when I did the show in Sacramento, that theater does, they do theater, they do, you know, plays in the round.  And the guy who runs the theater said to me, the two power spots are the center of the stage, and you're back to an alley, to a, you know, to an entrance alley.  So I figured that, but then the whole other thing is the cameras.  Because if you keep moving, which is your instinct, you're just, you're not getting any cameras as shot at looking at you for very long. 
[01:16:30]  But I had eight cameras all placed around, like a gun turret, kind of, and you just keep moving around.  Interlocking fields of fire.  Yeah.  That's what you need.  It's a triangulation of fire.  Was it easier or harder to edit like that?  It was weirdly easier, because there was always a camera that I was looking at full on.  And I could cut constantly without noticing.  Right.  It's like a rotary engine, like a Mazda rotary engines.  Very cool.  The little spark plugs catch the cylinder as it goes by.  I saw Pryor when he was, like, 1995 in Westbury. 
[01:17:00]  And he was in the round.  Was he spinning?  Yeah, because he was so slow, he couldn't.  Really fast.  That's what he should do.  Spin it to the point where the comic is literally hanging on.  Yeah.  And screaming.  For fear of flying off into the audience.  They put a plastic piece of clear plastic, and he was like a subterfuge against the fucking,  and I say that right, I hope so.  Centrifuge?  Yeah, I meant that.  Subterfuge.  Yeah, subterfuge.  It was like, yeah, underhanded.  Yeah.  Taunt I am.  So, Nicholas Cage, did I use the right word? 
[01:17:30]  Huh?  Huh?  What?  But he had cards on the floor.  Go ahead.  It was kind of hard to see, because he couldn't remember.  So he had all these cards, but he was kind of spinning slowly.  It was really sad to see.  What year was that?  95, 96.  Yeah.  Maybe the other.  Yeah, that's pretty.  Subterfuge.  That was something you wanted to do, right?  Just you wanted to do a special, so you did it.  I mean, an HBO special was one of those things that just for you was really important.  Well, I figured I would do another one this year, one way or the other, and I thought  I'd put it on my website, like the last one, because that worked.  It worked well for you. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  So I figured I'll just do that again.  Mm-hmm.  I knew I was going to do one, because I knew I was going to tour this.  I had this whole tour.  Yeah.  And then HBO came around, and they said, what are you doing with us?  And they said they would make it a big event.  Yeah.  And I said, I don't really want to do it, because I have my own way of doing it now,  and I own it, and why would I?  It's better.  They kind of have to match what you could do on your own, too.  They gave me a lot of money, and they gave me all so that I could sell it on my website,  just like the other ones.  So this one's going to be on my website in September. 
[01:18:30]  Jesus.  And I get the same five bucks, and I'm not, you know, that's my own thing.  How do you feel that everyone else is following your lead now and doing it your way?  No, I'm not as aware of what other people are doing.  I don't know how well they're doing at it.  I don't know.  I don't think it works for everybody.  No.  No, guys like Gaffigan, who has a great fan base.  A couple guys have done it.  There's certain guys that can pull it off.  A few guys have pulled it off.  It doesn't work for everybody.  It's not the only way or even the best way to do it.  No, but it takes a lot of the...  It makes the networks think...  It's a great thing, though, because it really makes everybody...  That's the next step for every comic eventually, although a lot of us can't do it yet. 
[01:19:00]  It's still like the next logical progression, and it makes the networks harder for them  to fucking dictate what you do.  Well, here's...  The thing is that you don't even...  It doesn't even have to be exclusive to...  You know, like Gaffigan's and Aziz's are both on Comedy Central now, I think.  And Netflix...  Mine is on Netflix now.  The one I put on my website.  And I was on FX, and it was on...  And now it's on Netflix, and I'm still selling them.  They keep selling.  So it doesn't matter. 
[01:19:30]  And that's what HBO was really smart, because I told them, I want to put it on my website.  That's all mine.  And I don't care what you do with the rest of the video money.  And they were like, all right.  So...  Did they make you name the boat the HBO?  Like, yeah, okay.  How much do you need?  Well, let me tell you a story.  Exactly.  But, yeah, it was really...  Because I was in a power position making the deal, so I was able to get a lot and do it  exactly the way I wanted to do it.  Good for you, man. 
[01:20:00]  But I am happy it's on HBO instead of my website also, because it's on...  There's still a lot of people...  I don't need everybody to know who I am, but people will stumble on it on HBO.  My thing that's on my website, no one's going to...  Yeah, unless they know you.  Yeah.  It's not in the rack that you flip through.  Right, right.  It's just in its own thing.  Yeah.  So the HBO thing, now it's more promotion and stuff.  How is the camera...  Because we were talking about cameras to use, and we didn't use the red.  We used a decent one, but I just couldn't.  It was too much more money.  But you used it.  What did you use? 
[01:20:30]  I used an Alexa on this last one.  That's like the best one, right?  That's what they shoot movies on, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Are you happy with how it came out visually?  Yeah, it's the best looking one I've done, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it that much different?  I don't notice a lot of that stuff.  Dude, the look of your taping was great.  I love how it came out, but I mean, I was very happy with it.  I can imagine it could look even better than that, to be honest with you.  Yeah, with the red is a better camera, and that...  It depends on how you want stuff to look, and also some of it is the age of the thing.  The Alexa will age quite a bit.  In other words, when there's a new generation of televisions, it'll look really good. 
[01:21:00]  The Live at the Beacon, when I actually shot on 4K, which is a huge movie,  and then we downgraded it to HD, but when there are 2K TVs, which are coming in a few  more years, Live at the Beacon will look actually better than this one, because this  one, the Alexa, it was smarter not to do 4K.  It'll take 10 years for this special to look shitty.  The Live at the Beacon will look good for another 20 years. 
[01:21:30]  Wow, man.  Yours will look really shitty in about five minutes.  And it sounds shitty already.  I'm just kidding.  But when you see the Richard Pryor specials, they don't look shitty.  No, because they're on film.  They're on film.  Yeah, you can't beat that.  But you know what?  Carlin's one that I saw that made me want to do it there, that one is in 77, that was  shot on some kind of beta, and it's really good.  Is it really?  Kellner directed that, right?  He did all the fucking Rolling Stones stuff?  Yes, he did.  It's also the lenses, too, because the depth of field makes it look so professional.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  When you get that background that's out of focus, and the foreground's in focus, yeah, it  looks great.  Yeah.  See, I said extreme close-up all the time.  I don't want them to miss one expression.  Tee hee.  Yeah.  Not one wink.  Cute little mug of yours.  Yeah, not one uncomfortable left eye fucking smattering.  Like when you say something kind of naughty, but then you look like...  Yeah, yeah.  Like I put my chin down, and the eyebrows go up like, you guys know.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's what I'm calling it, actually.  Come on now.  Adorable.  Dot, dot, dot.  You guys know.  You're not going to let me get away with that, are you? 
[01:22:30]  Because you know me.  Oh, shit.  I don't know the difference between...  We shot it...  She shot it in 24p.  Yeah.  I don't know what the difference...  They said it was good for what we were doing, but...  It's a frame rate.  24 frames per second is what movies are done in, and 30 is like live television.  So 30 looks like kind of glassy and live looking, and 24 looks filmy.  It's kind of stuttered.  Yeah, it's hard to describe that, like, especially the new frame rate now.  What is it, 48?  That's what that...  Yeah, the Hobbit was shot in like 50 different frame rates, and it's actually bizarre to look 
[01:23:00]  at.  Yeah, it looks...  And you can describe it like...  It looks like a soap opera.  It's like it's got a soap opera to it.  Well, like if you go to Europe and watch something on a PAL TV, like an old movie, you can watch  like Citizen Kane on PAL, and it looks like videotape.  It looks like...  That's so weird.  You're looking at the people right in front of you.  Like 80s porn, when that was shot on video.  Yes, that's what it looks like, and it looks bad.  It looks cheap.  Yeah.  I like it to look like film.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  What did I see that was shot? 
[01:23:30]  It was an old movie I was watching, the same thing.  It was like, how the fuck did this...  This looks like newer.  Why is it like that?  A lot of TVs come like that, and you've got to set the Hertz rate on it, or it just looks  like fucking shit.  It's a great movie that it directed.  The technology is going so fast that it's all becoming just piles of versions.  Yeah.  No one knows how to use anything anymore.  Right.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Like when you get a new TV now, it's like you get, okay, my cable box also has Netflix  and Vimeo and YouTube, and my TV has Netflix. 
[01:24:00]  Has it?  And my Apple TV has all...  They're all on everything.  Apple TV, my fucking Xbox.  Everything I have has everything I have.  It's a fucking mess.  It's a train wreck.  What are you...  Yeah, what am I using it on?  What am I fucking...  It's hard to focus on anything, because everything has just got so many different options.  You can't focus.  How are the kids, man?  They're great.  They're great.  I took them to school this morning, and they're good.  We just had spring break, and we had Easter, and I had all their friends over for Easter. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  They're still at the edge with coloring the eggs and everything.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Easter bunny and all that.  You like it, doing all that stuff?  Yeah, I don't...  You know, I don't like special occasions.  I like daily life.  Right, right.  That's more important.  You know what I mean?  The day-to-day shit.  The thing with the gifts and the thing, all that...  Christmas is really something, you know, but it's stressful.  Huh.  Incredible.  Yeah, but I like the daily life, you know?  Like, I've had girlfriends that didn't...  I don't make everything about Valentine's Day and birthdays, but I'm very generous, you 
[01:25:00]  know, and give them a lot of stuff.  Just be nice all the time.  Yeah.  Are the kids annoyed at how famous you're getting?  Yeah, because people come up to me when they're with me, and they hate that.  They do, right?  Now I'm on buses and shit, and that's weird, too.  They don't mind that.  They think that's funny.  Right.  But yeah, so they roll their eyes a lot?  People walk up to me.  Somebody yesterday, I was in the car with my daughter, and this guy comes up to my window,  knocks the window, and he's a cop.  He's a weird, even more...  He's not a uniform cop. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, shit.  He's got a gun on his belt.  He's got, like, his jacket on his arm, so he's an undercover cop with a badge and gun  on his belt.  Yeah.  And, you know, detectives also have a dark way about them, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And he knocks on my window, and I'm like, what the fuck, guys?  I don't know why.  And I roll in and he goes, you're fucking hysterically funny.  You're fucking hilarious.  And then he looks in the back seat and goes, oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, they get annoyed because nobody has any respect for them when they...  If I'm talking to one of my kids, people walk right, like, stand between us. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And say, can I have a picture with you or something?  Yeah.  Well, how do you handle it?  I just say, no, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  I used to be apologetically, no.  No, you know what?  No.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But then I go, no.  Like, why would you ask me?  No.  I'm waiting.  Fuck, I saw Louis C.K.  No, no.  I saw Louis C.K. today.  What a fucking dick.  Yeah, let him say that.  A lot of people go home like that.  I decided that that's okay with me.  I decided that that's the worst case scenario. 
[01:26:30]  That's fucking great.  God, that's real fame.  I met him once.  Damn.  He's a dick.  Wait, why?  I asked for his picture, and he didn't give it to me.  All right.  Well, I guess he's a dick.  So what was...  No one ever asked, like, what was the situation?  Well, he was talking with his kids.  His daughter's crying, and he's putting a band-aid on her knee.  And I took her leg out of his hands and threw her across the yard and said, can I have a  picture?  And you know what the cocksucker said?  No.  He said, no, you can't have a picture.  It's a dick.  Yeah, you never bother someone with their kids. 
[01:27:00]  Even I wouldn't do that.  No, and you're a fucking total pest.  When they're eating with their kids.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't fault anybody for asking this, because they want a thing, and they're fans.  I'm nice of them.  Yeah.  Not on any level, of course.  But I don't want to do it, so I just say no.  But I've had problems with girlfriends over the years, because if we're at an appearance  or something, where there's a lot of people that are there for us.  We're going to relate to Louis right now.  In a microcosm of an appearance we're doing.  You know, we had to actually go to where the fans were.  Right.  It's a microcosm on purpose.  We have to go with a petri dish.  Yes, a petri dish.  But girlfriends would get kind of like, I mean, they know that they're there to see you and 
[01:27:30]  shit, but they completely ignore them.  They'll step with their back and back into them to get in between you.  It's very disrespectful.  Yep.  Well, in that case, you're at work.  You're literally in a job.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  So they should just go get a drink in a corner and wait until you're done.  Hey, bitch, this is my fucking livelihood you're dealing with.  You didn't have to call her name.  All right.  Just tell her. 
[01:28:00]  Just tell her that she probably was.  That's stupid.  I think we all need an update on the boat.  Will you be boating this summer?  I need to know.  So the boat got dug out of the pile.  Yeah.  It was heavily damaged.  There's a lot of holes in the fiberglass.  And it sat on its running gear in a parking lot.  You know, the running gear, the propellers, are so very carefully honed.  It's like a musical instrument.  So it just sat on them with all its weight. 
[01:28:30]  It's not supposed to be like that.  No, so it's going to take some of the warm season to fix it.  I mean, I got insurance money, obviously.  The boat was only a couple months old when it happened.  So it'll be restored to full strength.  And then I got to sell it.  Oh, really?  Because I got another one.  Did you?  Oh, you know what?  Guaranteed, it wasn't big enough.  It's great.  You want a bigger one?  Yeah, of course.  You never get a smaller boat.  I own two boats now.  It's great.  Yeah.  You should take it out in fucking Amity, Long Island.  What size is the new one? 
[01:29:00]  It's 42 feet.  42?  Yeah.  And you're going to pilot this thing?  That's right.  Yeah.  It's a big fucking boat.  It's a big boat.  It's a big fucking boat.  It's a trawler.  It's easier to manage because it's a trawler.  So it sits in the water.  It's a displacement boat.  It's not a planer.  It doesn't plane up on the water.  So it just plows through things.  Does it have a big high fly bridge on it and everything?  Yeah.  It's got a fly bridge.  It's got a huge tank.  I mean, I could take this thing down to like, you know, probably to Maryland somewhere for, 
[01:29:30]  you know, one take a guess.  I could take it all the way to an island somewhere.  Yeah.  It would just take a long time.  It's slow.  Much slower.  Can you go out into the open ocean with that?  Yeah, you can.  I mean, the open ocean for us land lovers, we think of it as just this one big, but there's  all kinds of, you know, areas and you have to, I could go to Martha's Vineyard or something.  I'm going to try this summer.  Okay.  That's that good first foray into like open water.  That's right.  Like cruising.  That worked out great for fucking JFK. 
[01:30:00]  That's right.  That's right.  You're doing great.  Take it around the fucking Hudson a couple of times.  Take the ferry.  Exactly.  What's the matter with you?  That's great.  Is it just for pleasure boating?  Are you fish or anything?  I don't fish or anything.  I just really like being on it.  And I, this one has more livability.  So yeah, I'm probably going to, yeah, I figured that where I'll be with the writing  of the show, the first two weeks of July I have off.  So I'm going to take like a writer, like a floating writer's retreat and just live by  myself on the boat and go up to river. 
[01:30:30]  You can take a boat up the Hudson river to like the, the great lakes and all the way  to Canada.  And it's called the great circle.  You know how jealous I am?  That's one thing I want to do.  I think Lewis and Clark proved that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's like a lock system you can go through.  You get a Lake Champlain.  It's like you just discovered it.  You know, by the way, it's been known since 1785.  I will go up the Hudson river.  It's something I want to do.  Well, it feels very apocalypse now, uh, Joseph Conrad. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, that's great.  Just kind of putt, putt up the river.  Cause it's not a thing.  It's not like a treacherous ocean journey.  It's just moving and then throw an anchor once in a while, sleep on the boat.  The boat has, you know, full kitchen.  It's very, very full of all the amenities.  You wouldn't be freaked out sleeping.  It's got a little motorboat on it that you can take.  It's got us tender.  Correct.  Drop it in the water and you can go.  Yeah.  You'll be scared sleeping on that alone in the middle of the fucking.  What?  What is a sea monster going to come?  No.  Creature from the Black Lagoon.  It's a fucking bandit.  It's a billion bandits.  It's a fucking Somali pirates.  Yeah.  In the Hudson.  There's a lot of, who knows? 
[01:31:30]  There's a lot of places.  It'll just tie off and just chill out.  A lot of places.  Throw an anchor and, you know, our anchor is.  That's so great.  That sounds great.  Were you always into this nautical thing?  Or would you just kind of like?  I also like making trouble for myself cause I can't afford it.  I cannot afford this boat.  No.  I bought it outright.  No.  And I'm not the kind of, I don't have that kind of money.  That's a lot of money.  You really, if you're to buy a boat, you have to be, you have to have tens of millions of  dollars in the bank.  Yeah.  That's who, that's who my fellow boaters are.  Yeah.  The guy I'm buying it from, that I bought it from, the new one is like a, you know, 
[01:32:00]  he's a retired CEO of several corporations and I'm buying his boat and I'm like, I am  a comic and I had a good year and I'm in debt.  I'm in debt now.  Yeah.  You don't buy a boat with how much money you have.  No.  It's because you can afford a boat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't buy a boat when you have as much as the boat costs twice.  Yeah.  You buy a boat when you have so much fucking money.  Literally your accountant is like, if you buy a boat, you can save a couple of bucks on 
[01:32:30]  your taxes.  You should be able to buy 50 of the boats.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  And you still have an income.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking MC Louis.  It's going to be a fucking true Hollywood story.  Louis CK.  I'm trying to remember, I was listening to you guys were cracking me up.  I'm trying to remember what it was.  Damn.  Fuck.  You know, I can only listen.  I have two cars.  All right.  Whatever.  One to get to each boat.  That's right.  That's right. 
[01:33:00]  And this fucking stupid fucking company that you work for.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  We don't talk like that.  You didn't even have to say that we work for it.  We knew what you meant.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's like, you ever listen to Derek and Clive?  It's Dudley Moore and Peter Cook.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So there's this one where Peter Cook says, I wrote to the head of the BBC, and I just  addressed it, Cunt London.  That's the greatest thing.  So, anyway, I have the first car. 
[01:33:30]  You know, when you buy a car, you don't decide what kind of radio you get.  First of all, it's the same fucking company.  It's the same company.  It's a merged two companies into one company, right?  Yes.  I know exactly where you go.  When you buy a car, you don't order the radio.  You get a car that was already in the world.  I don't think anybody on earth buys a car, and then it gets made at the factory and sent  to you, unless you want to wait six months.  So you buy a car, you give the dealer your specs, he finds an inventory car in the area.  So it's arbitrary.  It might be a serious radio.  I don't know why they're different. 
[01:34:00]  Why?  It makes no sense that it's two different kinds of radios.  All right.  So you get your car, and the first one I got, it's got whatever.  I don't even know what the fuck, which one are you guys supposed to be on?  I know.  What are we, XM?  We're on XM, but we're also on the serious best out package.  All right.  So I'm on XM, so I'm on the XM radio, and then I want to hear Howard Stern.  I can't get him.  So I call, and they go, there's a premium package for the Howard Stern.  You have to pay more for Howard Stern.  I'm like, but that guy, like, owns half the company.  Like, I don't understand why that makes any sense. 
[01:34:30]  You merged.  And I tell the lady, that's ridiculous that I would have to pay more, and that I have to make  this phone call.  Not just the money, but that I have to fucking go through this to get something that's in  the fucking thing.  So she goes, well, we'll give you a month free, because you're upset.  So a month goes by, and then it shuts off.  I'm like, I'm not going to do this every month.  So then I buy a second car, and I get the car, and it's the other one. 
[01:35:00]  And I have Howard Stern, and I can't listen to Opie and Anthony, which I listen to every  fucking day.  So I call them up, and I go, why?  And she goes, because that's extra.  I'm like, wait a minute.  So they're extra.  I have to pay a premium to listen to Opie and Anthony in one car, and a premium to listen  to Howard in the other car.  How is this not a joke?  And I said to her, I own two fucking radios of both services, which means I am paying  a license fee already, a full license fee for Sirius, and a full license fee for XM. 
[01:35:30]  You always fucking brag that you can move your subscription from, why can't you make,  I would have to pay two premium fees to just listen to everything everywhere.  That makes no fucking sense.  And she said to me, their contracts make it, it's in their contracts.  Who, ours?  Yes.  No.  She said, the person who answers the phone.  Fuck her.  Said that.  She lied.  We want to be talking to more people.  She said it's in your contract.  We're dying to be across the board. 
[01:36:00]  We're begging to be across the board.  I know that.  Of course, I know that.  I know that.  I know that.  I know that.  Yeah.  We could double our audience if they did that.  And by the way, if I pay, so I said to her, so wait a minute, if I, so those guys  are getting extra money if I, if I.  Oh my God.  So that would mean that you guys would get paid extra if people, if more people sign  up for the premium, which of course isn't true.  If, if they're going to lie about that, I'm going to say this.  Everyone that answers the phones at the XM Sirius customer service has molested children.  Yeah.  You get to say it.  You get to just say it.  You get to say it.  Sure. 
[01:36:30]  But here's what we just, with what we just said about, about cable and how many ways you  can get everything.  Yeah.  Every way, every media company has to like fight to be, to make yourself a fucking pain in  the ass to use is the dumbest fucking thing.  Because I don't pay either premium service.  And as soon as my contracts run out on both cars, I'm not going to listen to satellite  anymore.  I'm just not going to listen.  This isn't eight channels on the old Zenith television.  No.  Where I have to get up to change it. 
[01:37:00]  If something's fucked up, I'll go to something else in a second.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  I'll plug it in my iPod.  I don't give a fuck.  It should be as, and that's exactly, music.  You have to make it as easy as possible.  Everyone knows that that runs a company.  Let Jimmy say something.  Music is good.  All right.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Yeah.  Music is on an iPad.  The iPod.  The one thing that fucking keeps people listening to this type of shit is live talk because you  can't put that on your fucking iPod.  And the amount of complaints we get every single day.  It's really dumb.  Our Twitter accounts get complaints all day long. 
[01:37:30]  How long ago did they merge?  Years.  We've been in the building four years, so at least four years ago.  In all those years, they couldn't, like, how do they expect a customer to understand  this?  It was a revenue stream that made sense for a while because they were getting extra  money, but now it just doesn't make sense anymore.  No, and also, why are they entitled to that extra money if I can't decide which one I use?  Yeah.  I can't decide.  It's totally up to somebody else what kind of radio I get.  Uh-huh.  Because they're both, look at that, Sirius XM. 
[01:38:00]  Is it a Sirius radio?  No, it's a Sirius XM.  That's what the company is.  It should be a Sirius XM radio.  We have an XM radio.  Oh, so can I just, wait a minute, but it's Sirius XM.  What the fuck are you doing?  It's a terrible business model.  It might make them a few extra dollars, but it enrages customers.  It gets everyone all confused.  And they're never going to see how many people they don't get because they're difficult or  how many people actually allow their subscriptions to lap for that exact thing.  Yeah.  No, this is what I always, like when I was in Australia, everybody told me that they  watched my show. 
[01:38:30]  And I figured they must be getting old versions of it because it doesn't air there.  But they were watching the show like the week before because the whole country pirates there.  Here, weirdos kind of pirate.  There's not that many people that pirate here.  Yeah.  But in Australia, moms and dads pirate video because we're not letting them buy it because  we're keeping it from them.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  We have shows that have been on the air here for like three years and we won't even give  them, if they're given the option, like everybody in the world is like, take my fucking  credit card and just let me have the thing and I'll pay.  But if you're going to be a pain in the ass, fuck you. 
[01:39:00]  I can steal all of it.  So the whole country of Australia rips TV and I learned this.  So when I put my Beacon special, one of the big important things to me was it was globally  available right away and they're happy to buy it.  Right.  So I told FX they should sell my show on my website and they said that we can't do that  because we can't let other countries see it before.  Oh boy.  And I'm, but what they're doing, all those companies and this piece of shit fucking company  that we're talking on right now is they're keeping money out. 
[01:39:30]  It's a cage.  It's keeping money out.  It's not, it's not keeping it in.  Right.  I think they're keeping money in, but they're keeping it out.  Yeah.  I really, by the way, what you just said, that should be a fucking infomercial for Sirius  XM.  And it's fucking enraging how they don't see that.  Why would they do it that way?  It makes no sense.  So you know long companies are doing business the same way before you decided to put something  on your site and do it differently.  It's like nobody wants to do anything differently until someone does it and then everyone goes,  oh, that's the way you do it.  Imagine having to buy a different TV for Fox News.  I do.  Fox, FX.  No.  No, you got to buy a different TV that gets that. 
[01:40:00]  And then you got to pay a premium.  The way radio and TV got so big was that there was nothing you had to do.  Right.  Simple.  You didn't have to pay for it.  You didn't even know you were paying for it by watching advertising.  Right.  You didn't even realize that you were paying their bills.  Your time.  That you were doing them a favor by watching the shit.  The feeling was that you just click it on and there's all this amazing shit.  Your favorite music.  It's amazing.  Your favorite stars.  Great stories.  The movies that were just out. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  It was amazing.  It's magic.  It really felt that way.  But now with the internet and with all this stuff and this shit and this subscription shit,  they're like, well, you know, we need you to give us this and you can only have this part  and then you can only do that.  It's just, well, I'll get free.  I'm going to go find free.  Thank you.  And there is absolutely right.  They should make it fucking easier.  And their thing is, well, from a pay service, you get unlimited content and no commercials.  Okay, fine. 
[01:41:00]  But still don't make it difficult once you're inside that area.  You should be able.  I don't have us on my car radio.  I am not listening.  I don't either.  That's amazing.  Because my car came with a serious radio.  So I didn't want to bother with this shit.  And I could probably make a couple calls and get a VIP account.  And that's a pain in the ass.  Who needs it?  I just didn't want to.  I'm a regular person.  I'm like, this is not, you know, I don't know.  I seriously recommend everybody that can hear my voice, shut off the system that is letting you hear it. 
[01:41:30]  We hear this shit every fucking day from our listeners.  And then the listeners that are hardcore and they understand that they need to pay for the service to keep us alive.  They get so frustrated and go, look, I tried, but I'm just going to like get it for free somewhere.  And it's offset by the people who were paying for the other one.  That's the thing that's crazy about it.  Once I had two cars, I'm like, wait a minute, but I'm, I am, I'm paying to have both.  You nailed it.  Because I have an XM radio in my house.  But there's serious channels I kind of like now.  And I go, oh, that's right. 
[01:42:00]  I can't listen to them in the fucking house.  What the fuck?  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the O.P. and Anthony channel.  Yeah, this is O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013.  You were correct.  Worst of 2013 for the O.P. and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you care to follow.  O.P. and Anthony have their own Twitter.  They have their own individual Twitters.  O.P. Radio. 
[01:42:30]  Anthony Cumia.  Jim Norton.  But we also have a show Twitter.  It's also the Instagram name.  And it's also the Facebook address.  O and A Show.  On all three.  O and A Show.  A and D.  A Show.  Very simple.  Make sure you follow everything I just told you.  And pass it along to your friends.  In this segment here, Roger Daltrey.  This is one of those weird times about working at Sirius XM where guests are just walking  around the hallway that we're not supposed to be getting.  Like they weren't booked for us.  They were booked for some other projects.  A town hall.  An artist confidential. 
[01:43:00]  Maybe, you know, specifically for the music channel.  Bruce Springsteen.  I mean, there's just so many things going on around here that different people are booked  for different things.  Because this guest happened to be walking around the hallway and we're like, do you  want Roger Daltrey?  Yes, we want Roger Daltrey.  And here it is.  Roger Daltrey.  This is O and A's Worst of 2013.  On the O and A Anthony channel.  It's happening.  We just got word.  Roger.  Wow.  Roger Daltrey's coming in here to say hi.  Who?  Holy fuck. 
[01:43:30]  Grew up listening to the who.  Are you kidding me?  Roger D.  Even I like the people.  What?  This is really cool.  Look at Travis.  Travis never gets excited.  I am so excited.  If we take a picture with him.  Holy fuck.  Let's just take pictures with him.  Who cares?  Can we spend our five minutes taking photos?  Yeah, we just want to spend our five minutes.  Thumbs up.  Here's Roger Daltrey coming in the studio.  Here's a big fan of mine.  There he is.  Hi, Roger.  Mr. Daltrey.  Pull up a chair, my friend. 
[01:44:00]  Very good.  We want to thank you for coming back.  We heard you were leaving the building and we kind of chased your dad because I got left.  He's a busy man.  You already left, right?  You're in the elevator ready to go.  What are you up to?  Quick, fill us in.  I'm just here to promote a charity.  What do you got going on?  I'm promoting Teen Cancer America.  Okay.  The foundation that we've got started over here that is to help teenagers with cancer.  Oh, that's a great cause.  Sure.  And it's to do with changing your system so that they recognize that the ages from 13 to 25 are very different from children and they're very different from adults. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  Telling me.  Yeah.  Do you think that they're not screened early enough?  Teenagers tend to suffer from very rare cancers.  Some of the rarest.  They also suffer problematically more late diagnosis because they're playing sports and things like that.  They also get aggressive cancer. 
[01:45:00]  Cancer becomes more aggressive in them because they're growing so fast.  So all in all, they suffer quite – they've got a disproportionate problem rate with teenagers.  Right.  And the trouble with the system at the moment is that most of the hospitals with their adolescent and young adult programs, they go from the age of 13 to 40.  And, of course, a 13-year-old and a 40-year-old have got nothing in common whatsoever. 
[01:45:30]  But we've found in England where we've been doing this for 23 years, we've built 25 hospital wards.  We've got another 10 being built at the moment.  But the evidence we've got by isolating the group, you can refine the medicine that they get.  Right, right.  So you get bigger success rates in the treatments.  Did somebody – did something inspire you to get involved with this?  Like was there something in your life that was affected by it and you said this is something we have to do more for? 
[01:46:00]  Well, it was my doctor that started it and I just – it kind of made perfect sense to me because it's nothing to do with drugs.  Even though the end result will be to do with how they use the drugs, this is to do with providing care, providing specialist carers, psychological support, parental support, and environment.  Because, you know, they think it's right that children should have teddy bears in hospitals. 
[01:46:30]  You go into a hospital and find me something that's teenage-friendly.  Right.  You'll have to hunt to find it.  Yeah.  So we just want to change that thinking.  And we want to make Teen Cancer America the gold standard so that – because every state is very, very different in the way they work.  By adopting that gold standard as a program, they can't hide if they're negating their duty of supplying specialist treatment for this specific age group.  Well, do you think that –  Does that make sense to you? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  No, it does.  Absolutely does.  Well, screenings happen when you're a certain age.  Like, you know, you want to get checked for prostate cancer or whatever it is.  You have to be a certain age for that to happen.  No, no, no.  The screening isn't a problem, but –  Jimmy.  Oh, no, I'm making sure.  There are lots of issues where boys have gone in and they've got a pain in their knee.  And they say, oh, you've been playing football.  Yeah, of course I have.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, of course I have.  Well, come back in three weeks.  And they come back in three weeks and they give them some anti-inflammatories or whatever. 
[01:47:30]  And it hasn't gone away, of course, and they give them some more anti-inflammatories.  They go back in six weeks and, of course, the guy's in agony.  Oh, man.  It can turn out to be a bone cancer where they have to, you know.  Roger, I was a little hypochondriac as a kid.  I always thought it was the worst thing ever.  Oh, my knee hurts.  It's got to be bone cancer.  That's what I always thought.  I was a terrible kid.  It's always crying.  Like I say, this hopefully will change it.  And we've got one unit out in UCLA, which was the first unit. 
[01:48:00]  There's a hospital in Seattle that came to our yearly conference three years ago in Britain.  And they've copied what we do in Britain.  And they're, I think, going to adopt our standard.  Yale are doing an outpatient chop down in Philadelphia.  So it's taking off.  People are getting it.  And the parents are getting it.  Because there's nothing worse than being a teenager where you're just coming into those times where, yeah, you can get laid. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, man, right.  You know, you go through all the things teenagers do.  Yeah.  And you get wham with this one.  Who doesn't appreciate a good teen, right?  Right.  Well, I didn't mean it like that, Roger.  I just mean, you know, they bring a certain joy to the world, right?  No, it's just a time in your life where you can finally have fun.  Exactly.  And then they're stuck.  And to stick them in isolation, which is what's been happening,  is it can have, you know, serious kind of cycles.  Is there any way we can get involved? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, just look up teencanceramerica.org.  And donate.  And donate and motivate the hospitals, the cancer hospitals in your states and area to look at what we're doing.  Come and talk to us.  How long have you been involved in the states?  I've been banging on doors for 10 years.  And two years ago, I got lucky with the head of UCLA, David Feinberg, who completely understood it like I did. 
[01:49:30]  When I was first told of what they were trying to do, just a bell went off in my head that this made such sense  because most medicine is hugely, hugely expensive.  Relatively, this is really cheap.  This is just organization.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  But the benefits are huge.  So that's what went off in my head.  And I just got lucky.  I met David and told him what we were trying to do.  And he got it.  He immediately got it. 
[01:50:00]  He sent the team over to Britain.  They looked at what we were doing, came back and said, we've got to have it.  Was David a Who fan?  I don't know whether he's a Who fan.  Really?  I actually never asked him that.  I mean, obviously, you have your top priority of this charity, which is fantastic.  But he had to have been like, God damn, who's next?  I played that thing until, you know.  I wore it out.  But for Dave Grohl and Robert Plant and me, we did a benefit.  You know, Robert Plant.  Oh, that guy. 
[01:50:30]  My mate.  My mate, Percy.  We did a benefit in someone's back garden in Hollywood.  They raised $2 million, paid for the unit in UCLA.  And that's how we got the foot in them.  Did you sing with Robert Plant?  I didn't do any.  No, I'd love to do an album with Robert Plant.  I'm going to call him in a minute.  You should.  I'm going to get the phone out now because you're just reminding me.  You know what?  You two have great heads of hair.  Yeah.  You two have the best heads of hair I've ever seen in rock and roll.  The sugar in the sand.  Unbelievable. 
[01:51:00]  So it's got to be nice, though, in your position where you know that people listen when you talk.  So when you use all the years of fame to get something really good done, that's got to be a nice feeling.  I, of course, wouldn't know for either of those reasons, but I hear it's got to be nice.  You know, what else do you do when you're not singing?  It gives me another motivation in my life.  I mean, for the last sort of 14 years, I've run a whole week of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which has been supported by most of the British pop bands.  Right.  Like last year, we had Paul McCartney, for instance, who have done it several times. 
[01:51:30]  More people have done it than not done it.  Right.  And we do a whole week, seven nights of charity a week, which is our biggest fundraiser.  And again, it gives you a purpose outside.  And the music business is great.  It's really, but it's not 24-7.  Right.  Yeah.  There's an awful lot of downtime.  What the hell else do you do?  Yeah.  Did you get to a point where, like, you get so successful where you're like, I just want to do something, not else, but something good with all this? 
[01:52:00]  Because, like, you're on top of the world and it's like, okay, how do I give something to people?  No, I basically saw the link that without the support of teenagers when we were, you know, in the 60s, none of this would have happened.  The rock business wouldn't be there without teenagers supporting it.  Right, yeah.  And I thought, well, this is a perfect vehicle to get the music business to support, which they did, and the comedy business in England.  And it just took off.  And by the end of next year, we're hoping that every teenager that gets cancer in Britain has access to one of our facilities. 
[01:52:30]  And what's the website and stuff that people can go to?  Is it teencancer?  teencanceramerica.org.  Okay.  I think it's .org.  We've got to get him out of here.  This was very nice of you to stop in.  Hopping in.  Yeah, well, good to see you.  Enlightening people here.  Sorry I haven't got more time.  No, that's okay.  No, it's all good, man.  But thank you for giving me.  We're obviously all huge fans.  It's not one of those things that many people want to talk about.  Right, right.  Exactly.  But I've got to tell you one thing. 
[01:53:00]  Of all the teens I've met, and some survive and a lot don't, sadly a lot don't, not one of them have ever, ever got me down.  They are truly magnificent.  And the courage is amazing.  Now, watching and seeing the fear and the terror in the eyes of the parents, that destroys me.  But the teenagers are fabulous.  So I try and talk about it with enthusiasm because I know they do, and they support it with enthusiasm. 
[01:53:30]  And they never get down, right, all the way down.  Yeah, yeah.  Excellent.  Very cool.  Roger Daltrey, everyone.  It is the worst of 2013, and my name is E-Rock. 
[01:54:00]  Hello.  How are you?  Moving along for the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've had a lot of great stuff today, but we're going to end it with a bang as we go into the infamous Tequila and Donut Day.  This goes back, I believe, February of this year, where one day I decided, well, along with Roland, we need some kind of theme.  I wanted to bring in some tequila, and Roland added donuts.  So it became Tequila and Donut Day, and it may have gotten a little out of hand, but I think all of you enjoyed it. 
[01:54:30]  And then we also meet Dennis Falcone.  I think this might be the first time Dennis Falcone from the 60s channel was on our show.  So Tequila and Donut Day, it's a multi-part segment.  Strap in, kids, as Anthony would say, as Tony Danza.  I can't do impressions.  Tequila and Donut Day.  The worst of 2013.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Today's a theme day.  What do you mean it's a theme day?  Eric has created a theme for today.  I don't know.  That's what I was talking about. 
[01:55:00]  Eric, did you create a theme today?  What a bunch of surprises today.  Yes, Roland and I created a theme.  Roland?  For real?  Yeah, it was mime, and then Roland jumped in on it, too.  So it's both of us now.  When are we going to find out about this?  When do we get to eat it?  I'm sure it's food-related.  I was waiting for Roland to show up.  We're the ones that are surprised.  We're surprised now.  Our names are on the wall.  It's a Friday.  We figured we'd surprise you.  What kind of theme, though?  Some kind of Irish theme?  I guess we could apply it to that.  I hate corned beef, so don't fucking... 
[01:55:30]  Yeah?  Tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly, tootly.  Yeah?  I want Irish music all day long today.  Ah, we're working on it.  All right.  We're doing fucking Irish.  Yeah, when Irish boys are symboling.  It's D&D Day.  Well.  Roland has just joined us.  I would bring you guys gourmet donuts, but your palate sucks.  I brought you the worst donuts ever.  I was expecting Dunkin' Donuts, but you brought this gourmet shit. 
[01:56:00]  And then E-Rock ran away because...  It's not just Dunkin' Donuts Day.  E-Rock, this is an E-Rock day.  Okay, Scott and Todd was not the big thing that he was planning for for today.  All week long, he's been planning for something.  And what is it?  He's going to present.  It's not Dunkin' Donuts Day.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  E-Rock, tell him.  It's not Dunkin' Donuts Day.  He just walked back in the studio.  He's hiding something.  What day is it?  Oh, no.  Today is Tequila and Donut Day. 
[01:56:30]  What the fuck is going on here?  Tequila and Donuts?  There's two bottles of Patron.  One is silver and one is caffeine.  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  Travis, what the fuck's going on?  Wow.  Like Sam said, Eric had an idea.  Yeah.  And here's his idea.  And the next time you shit on anyone, you see what happens when you give Sal and E-Rock the first segment. 
[01:57:00]  Holy shit, we did set up for this by giving Sal and E-Rock the first segment.  You're not missing anything.  And, of course, Sam is crying.  Because Sam and I have been so excited for this.  Why?  Because you knew it would be a bust-a-roo?  Now, do you realize tequila and Donuts don't really go together, right?  Well, it wasn't supposed to be Tequila and Donut Day to start.  Yeah?  But Nolan decided to add on the donuts to it.  It was just going to be Tequila Day.  Tequila. 
[01:57:30]  How do you have a Tequila Day?  It's 7 in the morning.  How do you not?  It's 7 in the morning.  All right, let's see you do a shot of Tequila.  Who's going to do a shot?  Well, E-Rock's going to do more.  Tequila Day.  I swear to you, I don't even give a fuck if this is bombing out there.  This is the weirdest fucking morning in a while.  Holy shit.  That's why you've got to just keep rolling with it.  It might be bombing at a moment.  The Sal story should have been amazing.  It wasn't because he didn't stick around to get all the details. 
[01:58:00]  And E-Rock presents us with something he worked on for, I think it is, close to 15 hours.  He just doesn't want to admit it anymore.  It's in here.  And Hank gave him a D on that.  And then he walks in with fucking tequila and Roland walks in with donuts.  Well, I figure you're going to eat these because it's breakfast.  Well, why?  Because it's breakfast.  Oh, man.  Why are most of the donuts, they got the holes in the middle, man?  You want to fill that shit in, don't you?  Because when you ask them to pick 12 donuts, they get very angry. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, because they want to get rid of the ones that don't sell well.  That's why you never tell them.  No.  I told the guy I wanted to pick, and he screamed at me.  I know he called me some asshole or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did he go,  No, I told him, your donuts are not that great.  Just let me pick.  Wow.  He don't care.  He's just a worker.  You don't give a fuck if you're trashing your donuts.  They're not great.  They're pretty good goddamn donuts.  Which one you got there?  I got like an apple fill.  Ooh.  Pretty goddamn good.  Do your shot at tequila, E-Rock.  I gotta get cups. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  And then we got Scott and Todd audio.  Sam's crying.  Tequila at 7 in the morning.  E-Rock's gonna do a shot at tequila.  You think Eric's just bringing us into his life like he just drinks tequila and listens to Scott and Todd?  And eats donuts and listens to Scott and Todd?  It makes no fucking sense at all.  The whole hour didn't make sense.  I know.  It's gonna be one of the worst hours we've ever done. 
[01:59:30]  I told you.  I like bizarre.  And that includes a balloon guy.  Oh, wow.  Holy fuck.  It could be.  We're all excited for it.  Later on, but not now.  That was a good donut.  Alright, so E-Rock has opened up the Patron.  He's just thrown in a coffee cup.  Down the hat.  Down the hatch. 
[02:00:00]  Here he goes.  E-Rock.  Salud.  He was...  And he just did a shot of tequila.  This is like so stupid and weird and...  Wow.  It's tequila and donut day.  E-Rock just did a shot of tequila.  That's 7.15.  Will you be doing another shot?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Throughout the show.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  This could get interesting.  Yes. 
[02:00:30]  And when do you start up Roland?  Roland's waiting for 8.  At nighttime.  I'm moving.  At nighttime.  I gotta move.  You're moving?  Yeah.  Where are you going?  I'll tell you during commercial break night now.  Why are you moving?  I thought you liked where you were.  I do a little bit.  Are you going to stay in the area?  Mm-mm.  Coming back to Manhattan?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think that's good for you.  Yeah.  You're a little isolated out there. 
[02:01:00]  Roland.  Even though you're...  You're leaving Long Island City.  Skyline pictures were terrific.  Terrific.  Oh, good.  We'll get different fucking...  We'll get different pictures from Roland.  Right.  To the other side.  Well, I don't know if the listeners could handle too much more, so we should probably break before  we did the Scott and Todd audio event that E-Rock worked on.  He put a bottle away.  He's got two different kinds of tequila in case you guys want to...  Why are you crying?  It's just so bizarre.  It's just the craziest shit ever.  And there goes the donut.  But I'll tell you why it's bizarre.  Like, E-Rock... 
[02:01:30]  E-Rock's all in.  Yeah, he is.  He came up with this concept.  Oh, we're going to do tequila and donut day, and it's going to be a huge hit.  And I think he really believes we're all just going to sit around drinking tequila together.  And in the end, he's going to be the only one.  Of course he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what makes you laugh, right?  Yes, of course.  Because he has no awareness that it's not going to work.  Because if anybody has any doubts, I'll sweep them away right now.  It loves a good drink.  He's not drinking tequila. 
[02:02:00]  I can pretty much guarantee that.  I am doing a shot of tequila.  I can pretty much guarantee.  While the sun is still in the sky.  Right.  And you know what was great?  This whole thing started.  Like, he got this idea.  Yeah.  When you guys were talking about tequila.  And you guys said you didn't even like tequila that much.  Yeah, I'm not a huge fan.  I'll have a shot here and there.  But E-Rock's the man.  He loves tequila.  He's like, we're doing tequila day, bro.  I was like, yes.  And then he did it.  He brought in tequila.  He's the man.  Travis, are you going to do a shot of tequila today?  I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  Roland, maybe a little later.  But it's tequila day.  Roland might be the only one that maybe later.  Maybe Troy would like some.  Troy would.  He's down for it.  Troy's not here yet.  So now you've got to find people to drink tequila with.  That's your job.  Sal, are you going to have a shot of tequila?  I'm at work right now.  I'm not getting up.  Someone bringing up the whole work thing.  Yeah.  Of course, Sal would be the one.  Eric's got a breakfast tequila.  No.  It's a breakfast tequila.  It's tequila and donuts.  Well, there's coffee in the other one.  Right.  That's what I mean. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's fine, man.  That counts.  He brought in coffee and tequila.  But he's having some of the Patron silver.  Be honest, C-Rocky.  You had no doubt in your mind that people would drink tequila with you?  Please be honest.  You want me to be honest?  I thought it would just be a way so I could drink tequila while we're doing the show.  No.  That's not true.  That's why I bought enough for everybody.  Yeah, but that's my question.  I don't even like the coffee one.  No, that's what I'm saying.  Spread it around.  Do you really believe everyone would be all in and start drinking tequila with you? 
[02:03:30]  Take it to the offices upstairs.  See who wants a shot.  Maybe they want to join in on tequila and donut day.  Fucking crazy.  It makes no sense.  No.  Sure.  Maybe Scott Greenstein wants a swig.  Yeah, why don't we go down the wall?  Maybe he wants to take a belt.  Yeah, just walk around with one hand with your Patron.  The other hand with all the donuts.  Wait a minute.  You could be the shot girl.  Donut?  Tequila? 
[02:04:00]  Donut?  A lot of people saying on Twitter, I just quick, quickly.  Yeah.  Check quickly.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  They're saying at least it's not gay.  Well, that's true.  You're right.  You want to do another shot before we go to break?  Do another shot real quick.  One more.  It's tequila and donut day.  Yeah, make it happen.  I think every time you have a donut, you've got to have a shot of tequila.  Right.  Let's start.  Can you tell us about the movie now?  And this is your segment, right?  You came up with tequila and donut day? 
[02:04:30]  I came up with tequila.  All right.  You just had the donut.  Okay.  But you came up.  Okay.  So you came up with tequila day.  You got to fucking have confidence in your segment.  Yeah.  You can't all of a sudden go like, nah, I won't do a shot.  It's fucking tequila and donut day now.  It's your bit.  Let's go.  One more.  It's already got a higher grade in my book than your Scott and Todd thing.  You're already.  What do you give tequila and donut day?  Right now, it's getting a fucking, a good B.  A good B.  Wow.  A solid B or a solid B? 
[02:05:00]  Are we talking B plus?  It's teetering on B plus.  This could definitely go to A before the end of the show.  I'll tell you that much.  Plus, if he rocks drunk on the air by the end of the show, it's a fucking A plus plus plus plus.  It's A plus, yes.  Could you get the word out to Nicole from the morning mashup?  Oh, shit.  I think she might enjoy a shot of tequila.  You sure?  You probably don't have to tell her.  Open the bottle one more time.  She'll smell it.  I'll be here like a bloodhound.  7.20.  She may not be here yet.  When do they start?  Seven.  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:30]  They start walking around.  And how many hours do they do?  Three?  They do three and they've got 18 people that are on the air.  Jesus.  Noodles all over me.  Why are we the only ones that do four hours?  I don't know.  I think, don't they do like a couple hours and then they rerun it immediately after?  From 10 to 11, they rerun the first hour.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  We should do that.  Good for them.  Rerun this hour?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe not this hour.  Maybe not this hour.  This might be one of those one and dones. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, boy.  We've got a few of those out there.  A little tequila burp there?  Yeah.  Hopefully you're listening live because you're not going to ever hear this hour again.  Unless Iroch starts puking from too much tequila.  Oh, boy.  So, the lesson we learned today is don't try.  No, no, no.  Not necessarily.  You could try.  Have you done the second shot, Iroch?  You need to work on your awareness.  Oh, yeah, Sam.  Well.  You know, it is tequila day, so part of that is a party, you know? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So, I opened the invitation up to the mashup.  Okay.  Rich said, tequila day, perhaps after my egg sandwich.  Okay.  That's just some logic there.  And Nicole, who we all know likes to party every now and then, said, that's fucking disgusting.  That's really weird.  Her feet?  She'll be here in 20 minutes.  Oh, I thought she was talking about her toes.  So, no takers just yet.  Wow.  So far, no takers with the tequila, Iroch. 
[02:07:00]  Just you.  Iroch, I'm sure other people will come on board, you know, maybe by 8 a.m.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Other people will come around.  It's still early.  And I just realized.  I mean, I know, you know, he gets made fun of every now and then, but he's still a part  of the team.  I think it's like, the fact that Gary hasn't been offered a shot of tequila is like, a little  disrespectful.  That is disrespectful.  Yeah, you gotta make sure you offer him whenever he arrives.  Yeah.  Around 9 o'clock, maybe he'll be here.  I don't know what time he gets here.  Did you float this by management?  Hey, we got a segment we want to do, Tequila Friday. 
[02:07:30]  Oh.  So this didn't get approved.  Are you going to try to expense the tequila?  No.  Look, he committed.  As far as I'm concerned, 10 points for Eroch.  10 points.  Yeah, yeah.  How about you do your second shot?  Do your second shot before break and then we'll break.  We'll continue with Tequila and Donuts Friday.  Wow.  Well, there it goes.  And we continue with Scott and Todd audio that he worked on as well. 
[02:08:00]  There it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he felt that one.  I felt the burn.  How's that?  It's good.  You feeling it yet?  Not yet, not yet.  Feeling a little warmth feeling, though?  A little warm feeling?  No, but give it a little bit more, probably.  Better have another donut, too.  Maybe a glaze or sugar to kind of balance it.  Because chocolate's too much.  Chocolate and tequila doesn't work too well.  Works in my coffee.  I shit myself. 
[02:08:30]  I'm not going to lie.  I had a piece of cake, a chocolate cake, and drank a lot of tequila.  Left a bar and exploded in my ass.  They're with that date.  Yeah, that's a bad day right there.  Yeah, she goes, where are you going?  I shit myself and I left.  Show started out a little weird today.  I was thinking, uh-oh.  But I think we're turning this thing around.  Yeah.  I think we're turning this thing around a little bit.  I think maybe during the break, since he, since the, at its core, tequila day is a celebration.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  E-Rock should spend some time trying to find some people that will. 
[02:09:00]  That's exactly right.  Take some tequila shots.  That is, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't drink.  I would do it.  He needs a drinking buddy.  Yeah, let's find some more people to do tequila with E-Rock.  Well, this segment almost made me forget how shitty Sal's story was.  Lack of pictures and.  E-Rock saved the day.  He really did.  Yeah, I think you saved the day again, E-Rock.  Good one.  All right.  All right.  We got Rich Voss coming in a little later.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's playing, uh, Maguire's out there in Long Island.  So, we got him coming in another hour or so.  That night.  And we got the Scott and Todd audio and.  And more tequila shots for E-Rock. 
[02:09:30]  And more tequila shots for E-Rock.  Excuse me.  You feeling it yet?  Tequila burps at fucking 7.30.  You feeling it a little bit?  No, it'll be, it'll happen soon.  He's feeling it.  The second you do a shot of tequila, you get that warm kind of.  But I had a donut right after.  Oh.  It might take a little.  It's about time we got Eric nice and loosened up on this show.  A little bit.  Oh, God.  We might see a new E-Rock today. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I can only imagine.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We'll break here.  More tequila, more donuts, and more stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 continues right now.  Right now.  Right now. 
[02:10:30]  Right now.  It's tequila and donut day.  Tequila and donut day.  How are you feeling, E-Rock?  It's starting to take effect.  And I heard you found someone to do a shot of tequila for tequila and donut day.  Nice.  I found a few people.  A few people.  One will do it right now.  A couple will come during their breaks.  Really?  Wow.  Who are these people?  Are we allowed to say?  The first person.  I don't actually know what he does here.  But his name is Dennis.  He sits outside our office. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Dennis is the one that drives me nuts about the Islanders every single day.  Found out I was an Islanders fan.  So we have a little chit-chat in the bathroom every morning about the Islanders.  Every time I see them.  The Islanders.  I'm not in as much this year.  And, of course, they're doing okay.  Let me fill you in on something also.  When baseball season kicks in.  He does the same to you with baseball.  It's the Yankees.  Oh, it's all about the Yankees.  Oh, boy.  The Yankees, Yankees, Yankees.  I thought he was just a hockey fan.  That's a little strange.  So he's going to do a shot. 
[02:11:30]  I was breaking down the tequila thing with Anthony.  Iraq, you know what, though?  I might be wrong because people are now coming to the table to get their shots of tequila.  There he is.  What's up, Dennis?  Slobo.  How are you?  Thanks for being here.  He's calling Iraq Slobo.  You picked up on the nickname, huh, Dennis?  Yes, yes.  You like that one?  Slobo.  It's fitting.  It's Roland's favorite.  Roland loves that nickname for Iraq.  You going to do a shot of tequila?  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, why not, right?  I'll celebrate the Islanders' win last night. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, there you go.  I told you.  Islanders.  The Islanders.  Do they have a good team this year?  No.  The rich DPH is down in the minor leagues.  He's doing some minor league stuff now.  Yeah, that makes our team better.  Yeah, there you go.  He's a bust.  We all know it now.  But with the injuries and all, he's now a bust.  And our superfan got arrested for spanking a girl in the parking lot or something.  What?  But he's saying he just hit her in the back.  Who?  What?  We have a superfan that's always been creepy.  He has this gold fucking tinsel hair. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah?  He's been there forever.  Oh.  They arrest him in the parking lot for, like, smacking a girl in the ass or something.  Wow, I didn't know that.  Because it was her birthday.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Arrested?  Yeah, arrested.  And he's trying to say he just hit her in the back.  Used to be able to fucking...  Roland!  Roland's slamming a shot at tequila.  Roland just slammed some tequila.  Roland's got a different bottle of tequila, though.  What is it?  He's got the Clooney.  Clooney.  Casa Miga.  Miga.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  That's good.  Which is the bottle that pours yourself a shot? 
[02:13:00]  That's the one that...  What's his name advertises?  Just the one.  Yeah?  The guy who played Christopher Moltisante on...  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Christopher.  No, it's not that.  It pours yourself a shot.  I just took your shot here.  This is just regular Silver Patrol.  This is very nice.  It is.  Did you have yours ready?  Dennis, what do you do here?  I know you...  Oh, that's a good question.  I know we've had a lot of conversations about the Islanders over the last few years.  I work in the music department.  The oldies channels.  I program some of the music.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Also, while I DJ on the channels. 
[02:13:30]  Whoa.  Well, I hear it in your voice, Dennis.  Wow.  Anything with Cousin Brucey?  Yeah.  I work with Cousins sometimes.  You do work with the Couss?  Yeah.  I used to work with him back at CBS FM.  CBS FM!  Wow!  Did you know Ron Lundy?  I worked with Ron, yeah.  Ron Lundy.  I worked with Ron.  That was a nice guy.  How about I Am B.B.?  I Am B.B.  10 till 10.  W-E-N-B-C.  That's all he said.  That and his name in time shifts.  That was it.  I Am B.B.  About 10 till 10 now.  Yeah.  I Am B.B.  Brand new one now.  Starland Vocal Band.  66 W-E-N-B-C. 
[02:14:00]  Got it.  You really did.  That's it.  And you just slammed a shot of fucking tequila.  Hello, love!  This is nice.  This is nice.  You like that?  I know.  I'm not doing shots.  Sam's not a big drinker.  No, there was a disc jockey in New York years ago, Ted Brown.  And every, I think, Memorial Day, he used to get drunk on the air.  Like a doctor would come in each time.  And we did that at a radio station I worked with.  But the DJ didn't like alcohol, so he drank like whiskey sours.  And all he did was get nauseous by the end of the day.  Yeah, whiskey sours, you can't drink. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, what to show how drunk you could get.  To show how much alcohol.  Before the big Memorial Day weekend.  Yeah, exactly.  To give you the breathalyzer.  Yeah, normally these things are done under the supervision of a police officer.  With a breathalyzer.  It says a lot today.  It's like I'm going to do a shot to kill.  It's too early.  It's too fucking early.  8 o'clock comes soon.  Oh, God.  There's no way.  9 o'clock?  No way.  I am going to do a shot in the morning.  You drove in, didn't you?  I just can't, huh? 
[02:15:00]  You drove in.  Well, I have to drive home.  I didn't know if you were staying in the city or not.  Oh, boy.  He's slurring.  I like it.  He started.  A little slur?  He went, it's a little.  It's very slight.  Only us drunks can really pick up on it.  But he said, he goes, like the S.  He said, I didn't know if you were staying in the city or not.  I didn't know if you were staying.  He's trying very hard.  You can see it.  He's trying very hard to keep his enunciation.  And you know what's starting to pipe through a little bit?  Some of that E-Rock confidence. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, shit.  Liquid courage.  Liquid courage.  Yes.  Why didn't you buy the coffee tequila Patron?  Oh, boy.  Because, actually, people really do like it.  I don't care for it.  But a lot of people like that better than the silver Patron.  I bought both.  Silver Patron.  Yeah, it's good.  You want another shot, Dennis?  I want another shot, Denny.  Denny!  Denny!  Denny!  What do you say, Denny?  D-Man!  For the Islanders!  The D-Meister!  Yeah, D-Man!  Another almost 500 season.  E-Rock's pouring him a little cup. 
[02:16:00]  And another shot for E-Rock.  And E-Rock, why are you putting the cap on that?  I have mine.  Oh, shit.  There it goes.  E-Rock, is this your third shot?  This is my third.  All right.  All right.  Denny!  All right.  Because I'm doing the South Beach diet, so I really got to watch my hydrates.  This guy's got a million of them.  Yeah.  You want to do a little more radio for us?  You got another impression, please?  DJ Dennis.  One of the twos.  Well, yeah.  I also do a little mobile DJ work, too.  So if you're ever having a private party, you need somebody.  You know, I know you always throw a big Super Bowl party. 
[02:16:30]  So if you ever need a DJ, you know, I'll bring the tunes along.  We'll rock the house.  We'll rock the house.  We'll rock the house.  Get everybody up to do the Harlem Shake.  Do you do that?  I do it.  I'm one of the kids, Dennis.  The youngsters.  You know the kids.  They're always doing the wacky thing like the Harlem Shake or the Macarena.  So you're doing that mobile DJing on the weekends?  Sure.  I've been doing that for a long time.  Wow.  God bless you.  I did it for one summer up in, where was I?  Rochester or Buffalo?  Rochester, maybe? 
[02:17:00]  No, Buffalo?  I don't remember.  Oh, boy.  I think it was Buffalo.  I hated it.  Really?  Yeah, man.  You're going there to give the people four hours of fun, and you're working out with somebody?  Oh, what kind is that?  Ew, it looks like shit covered.  That is the shittiest.  You picked the shittiest looking donut.  That's a blueberry donut.  Yeah, I think it's blueberry.  I recognize that.  Are the blueberries evenly distributed through the entire donut?  They sure are.  Equal number of blueberries in every donut.  Do you know how long that would take?  I love the guy's face.  Do you know how long that will take?  Dennis, you want to talk up a record for us?  Equal number.  What are you playing?  What do you got?  Any songs here? 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  Well, what kind of...  What's your genre?  Well, I like the oldies.  Oldies.  A couple little 70s on sevens.  70s on sevens.  That's where the cousin is.  Give us a band.  He's on 60s on six.  I don't want to say...  Give us a band.  A little Saturday Night Fever music, maybe?  Ah, the Bee Gees.  Can you talk it right to the post?  I could try.  All right.  What about Night Fever?  Well, Night Fever, 1978.  It's a good song, right?  Biggest selling album of all time, up until Thriller.  Wow!  That's amazing.  I love this.  That was a double album.  Now it's available on one disc, one CD. 
[02:18:00]  Amazing.  The future.  What the future held for us, we didn't know.  You can't fucking clean your pot on it, though.  Right?  Double album was great for cleaning your weed.  I feel like my alarm clock hasn't gone off yet.  What is going on?  Dennis is rocking the ones and twos.  What do you mean?  Dennis.  What the fuck's going on?  I like it.  I swear to God, what's going on, Sam?  What's Tequila Day, Ovi?  Tequila is Friday.  We left the creative of the show in the hands of Eric Nagle today.  I have a feeling.  I have a feeling.  People are going to get fired.  What? 
[02:18:30]  Here's what's going to happen.  I'm going to hear a sound, and it's going to be my alarm going off, right?  Yeah.  And then I'm going to wake up.  I'm going to come into the show.  Right.  And the first break is going to be me trying to convey this dream to you.  Right.  And it's not going to make any sense at all.  No.  You're just going to be like, wait, what?  So why was it Tequila Friday?  I'll be like, I don't know.  It was a dream.  It's so weird.  Eric was in charge of the show for the day.  I don't know what happened.  Put it this way.  Sal started the show.  What?  And it's like, what?  That would never happen. 
[02:19:00]  And that's just because he told me he had an interesting story.  Well, he told you wrong.  All right.  Well, Dennis wants to talk up Night Fever.  You got Night Fever?  I like Night Fever.  Oh, this is a good one.  The Bee Gees, Robin Barry-Maurice, unfortunately, most of them are not with us anymore.  But we do have the memories here on SiriusXM, commercial-free, 70s on 7.  Don't forget, every weekend, Casey Kasem here counting them down, just like he did back  in the day.  That's pretty good. 
[02:19:30]  He's got the voice, man.  That's pretty smooth.  You got the smooth fucking voice, man.  Too bad that voice doesn't pay off.  I like it.  I slur my way through a show every morning.  And make a fucking boatload of money.  Enjoy your golden voice.  Go fuck yourself.  I slur my way through the morning.  Jesus.  This guy has the actual pipes and a good voice.  It's smooth.  And he has to mobile DJ on weekends to make ends meet.  Oh, Christ. 
[02:20:00]  God, I love my life.  Oh, Denny.  That is fucking funny.  Oh, sorry, you're still here.  Denny's still here.  Denny, you want another song, maybe?  No, that's okay.  DJ Denny.  We're enjoying?  I'm doing this, though, man.  But I do have work to do today.  Oh, shit.  You can wait a little longer.  You got to run some channels?  I want to make the subscribers happy.  That is a good fucking goal.  Wow, that's so weird.  Why would you want to do that?  Because I don't have the chance to get up and slur my words through every song.  All right, you got to leave us with one more.  All right, sure.  One more tune. 
[02:20:30]  What could we get from the 70s something?  How about the 60s?  I like the 60s.  Oh, the 60s, too.  Okay.  How about the Mamas and the Papas?  How about the Swing of Medallions?  You got that double shot of my baby's love?  That's a good one.  Whoa.  All right.  That's a tequila shot.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Iraq, can you find it?  The Animal House vein of the Frat Rock.  Oh.  A little Frat Rock for the weekend.  Oh, here we go.  1965, Sirius XM.  60s on 6.  Don't forget tomorrow night.  Right around 8 o'clock Eastern Time.  Everybody's favorite cousin. 
[02:21:00]  Cousin Brucey will be here taking your request, so make sure you check him out.  Sirius XM, let's swing with the medallions one time.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'm digging it.  That's good.  He's smooth.  Denny.  I'm done.  He's a pro.  I got a question for Dennis.  Yeah.  I don't know how things work on other channels.  Let's say on the 70s on 7, if you came in one day, or say 60s on 6, you went into Brucie  and everybody's there, and you brought in two bottles of tequila, and you go, hey, everybody, 
[02:21:30]  it's tequila shot day, and you just started getting yourself fucked up while you were programming  the music.  How would that go over?  I'd probably be back working at an AM radio station somewhere.  Yeah, exactly.  Driving the van.  That's why Noah's talking about those things.  Giving away koozies or something.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But that's why Noah's talking about those shows.  No balls.  They don't know how to think out of the box.  Yeah.  I'm all in for tequila and donut day, Iraq.  I've turned the corner.  I am, too.  Woo!  It's great.  Who's the next person to come in and do a shot?  We're waiting for other shows to go to break, and then they'll come back. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  I told them, I said, if you see the mic on you.  Dennis has work to do.  Thank you, guys.  He's got work to do.  Have you some great weekend.  See you back here on Monday morning, okay?  9-8.  He's got that smooth voice, man.  It's very smooth.  I like it.  I'm going to put in a good word for you with Scott Greenstein.  Ooh.  I'm going to move you up a little bit in the organization.  Hmm.  I'll drink to that.  I'll drink to anything at this point.  You want a donut?  No, I'm okay.  It's donut and tequila day.  You can't have tequila without the donut.  Mm-mm.  You sure?  Nope.  Oh, you've got the South Beach. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, I'm doing the South Beach.  Oh, South Beach.  Yeah.  Because, you know, before you know it, it's bikini season.  Keep a little svelte.  All right, Danny.  You wear a ball bag?  A ball bag.  A banana hammock.  Yeah.  Cheers, guys.  A salute.  Thank you very much.  A salute.  Appreciate being a part of it.  Hope you enjoyed the tequila on this tequila Friday.  What a nice guy.  Yeah, he is a nice guy.  Danny's a nice guy.  Yeah.  And he loves the Islanders.  What happened?  I never see your desk anymore when I come in in the morning.  I have another desk. 
[02:23:00]  I come in a little later.  Ah.  I used to come in at 5 o'clock Eastern time.  You did?  Now I'm back in at 7 a.m.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Oh, good for you.  Yeah.  Must be nice.  Take the Long Island Railroad in every day with all the laborers, all the union guys.  Ah, regular Joes with their container of coffee.  Yeah, we need a big lunchbox.  Yeah, yeah.  To look at you and say,  That's all I know.  There's a laborer, right?  A lot of times,  A lot of times,  Roland will go up to Dennis and say,  I'll buy you a burger if you walk into E-Rock's office and yell out Slabo. 
[02:23:30]  And Dennis does it every time.  And he's a nice guy, though, Slabo.  You know, he plays along.  Oh, Slabo.  I haven't said Slabo in a while.  No, but Roland.  Might have started that one,  but I've since stopped calling him that.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah, you started it.  How are you feeling, E-Rock?  I'm doing all right.  Three shots in.  I'm doing good.  Yeah?  You're doing okay?  You're fine?  Dandy?  I'm dandy. 
[02:24:00]  Good.  I have a feeling he's going to be on Ron and Fez today.  Fucked up.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Hey, E-Rock,  why don't you come in here?  So it's the kill of Friday, huh?  Have some shots?  Pepper will do some shots with you.  Pepper would do some shots, right?  Hey, you brought Scott and Todd audio today, too.  Yes.  Now, what's this about?  Over the years with...  Danny, you can leave.  There's no...  We can't give you the official goodbye.  Just get out of here.  Go.  Take it easy, my friend.  Go program some oldies, please. 
[02:24:30]  Put in some fucking...  All right.  Add in Midnight Confession.  I like that.  Midnight Confession.  And Vanilla Fudge version has set me free.  Oh, you keep me hanging on.  Keep me hanging on that one.  Yeah, yeah.  You keep me...  The long version.  No edits.  Set me free.  Why don't you, babe?  Get out my life.  Why don't you, babe?  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  This is some drug music right here.  Turn this up.  Beep.  Whoa.  It's groovy.  This song's seven minutes.  It's okay.  What else are we doing?  All right.  This is fucking...  There's a live version of this on YouTube.  Yeah.  It's fucking hilarious.  Why?  Because they just look like they're fucked up out of their minds. 
[02:25:30]  Whoa.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Tonight, from New York.  Oh, you're right.  Whoa.  That's the wrong version.  Tequila Friday, everybody.  See, kids, you can't drink and drive.  Tequila Friday.  Who's driving this ship?  Exactly.  It's like, whoa, this song's seven and a half minutes long.  It's not a song.  What was that other version from? 
[02:26:00]  It said from Ed Sullivan.  Oh, well, it was Sullivan years.  Ed Sullivan.  It probably was.  Oh, my God.  This is some drug music.  This is severe drug music.  This is the H.  Intro is so long.  Might have to talk this up.  Let's have Dennis do it.  And Danny.  Wow.  Danny.  You can talk this shit up.  Join us a week from next Tuesday. 
[02:26:30]  We're just running through all the days.  This one taking you right back to the 60s.  You know the era of Woodstock.  Free love.  Oh, summer of love, baby.  Here on WCBS.  FM.  60.  Ta-da-da.  Hi, hi, hi, hi.  This would be forever.  Din it, din it, din it.  All right, here comes Snow.  That was the big intro. 
[02:27:00]  Turn it up a little bit.  A little more volume.  Who is the drummer in Vanilla 5?  Wasn't it, what's his name?  Peace.  Carmine.  Carmine and Peace.  Didn't he join after the fact?  All right, maybe.  Set me free.  Why don't you, babe?  Yeah, love my life.  Why don't you, babe?  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  You really don't want me.  You just keep me hanging on. 
[02:27:30]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  You're real heads on me.  You're real heads on me.  You'll just keep me happy.  And there ain't nothing I could do about it.  Why do you keep coming around?  Got a few people really questioning E-Rock.  Really?  This guy Joe in North Carolina.  There's got to be something behind Eric drinking Patron this early.  Ah.  Is there something else going on with you, E-Rock? 
[02:28:00]  Could be.  No.  This was just based off the conversation we had earlier in the week about tequila.  All right.  You coming in for the Scott and Todd audio that you brought to the show?  Do you want me to?  Sure.  I certainly do.  And we'll celebrate to Scott and Todd while he's in here.  He's three shots in, right?  Shot of tequila.  Three shots in is a good fucking buzz.  Don't you think it?  You're feeling it.  That's a pretty good buzz.  But you've got to watch when he's pouring too.  I think he's going light with the shots.  No, he's not.  Look at the bottle.  I've been watching the bottle.  Oh. 
[02:28:30]  Maybe I'm wrong then.  It was a pretty decent hit taken out of that bottle already.  And also, you've got to realize the weight to liquor ratio there.  Sure.  Somebody who's a little more rotund can drink a little more than someone who's a little  more of a slight frame.  That's a polite fat joke.  No.  No, it's actually just the, like, fat, but that's okay.  All right.  So, Iraq, why not just pour another shot? 
[02:29:00]  There's no one else in here.  What?  Well, you've got to still keep it going.  It's your fucking bitch.  It's tequila Friday.  Let her rip.  You want another donut, too?  Nah, I'm getting left.  Oh.  He doesn't like sweets.  We've learned that over the years.  Yeah, it's not a big thing with the sweets.  There ain't nothing I could do about it.  Din, din.  You know I need your love.  Jesus.  You really think he's fucking nursing it, Sam? 
[02:29:30]  No, I know.  Are you kidding me?  I just saw that.  Whoops.  It's the real deal.  This is the man.  Eric Nagel.  I poured a little too much.  Denny?  By the way, Denny's not working yet.  Get him back in here.  Denny's just walking around.  Look at him.  He's wandering aimless.  Oh, I think he just heard the reef.  He just heard the fucking...  He's talking around.  He's walking back.  He's like, the office is talking to me.  He's coming back.  Denny's coming back.  Wow.  He's got a swagger. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  You notice he's got a swagger when he walks?  He didn't have that swagger earlier.  No, he didn't.  Tequila gives you a swagger.  Here comes Denny.  He's going to do one more.  Denny's going to do one more.  I'm going to do one more.  You're doing one more?  I'm going to do one more.  One more, Denny.  You're doing one more, Denny.  He does.  Oh, he's chewing gum.  Smart move.  We'll do another one.  We just played the Vanilla Fudge.  I heard it.  Yeah.  You like it?  Yeah.  It's good.  The long version.  You know what, though?  You guys always program in the short version. 
[02:30:30]  And he doesn't go,  And there ain't nothing I could do about it.  He doesn't do that in the short version.  No, just the single version.  Yeah, I don't like the single version.  You've got to do the long version.  WNBC playing the long versions of songs.  That was Bob Pittman's thing when he first went over there.  Really?  Playing the long versions of songs.  That was a selling point?  Yeah, that was it.  That's fantastic.  Ellie Dillon came in and did Mornings.  Remember that?  No.  Yeah.  She replaced Imas.  I remember the Nightbird, Alison Steele.  She was on NAWFM.  That was, yeah.  Wait, who was the guy that replaced Imas and he was known for what? 
[02:31:00]  Ellie Dillon, who I believe was dating Bob Pittman.  Wow.  He knows all this dirt.  Right.  All the radio dirt.  Radio rats.  Radio rats.  Radio rats.  Yeah.  You want to talk up another song before you're shot at tequila?  And add in, like, tequila and donut day, by the way.  Oh, well.  You want to sell that?  Yeah, you've got to add that in.  Yeah.  And it's, you know.  The listeners are getting involved.  Just got a tweet from Struff.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Who's at home doing shots of tequila.  Nice.  Nice.  On this tequila Friday.  Tequila and donut Friday.  It is.  Makes no sense.  Hey, do we have Lotta Love by Nicolette Larson?  I like that one.  From 1979.  Let's get Nicolette Larson, Lotta Love.  Is that one gonna take a lot of love?  There you go.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, okay.  Remember that.  You got that one, Sal?  Oh, man.  You don't just start.  Oh, come on.  Jesus, Sal.  Sal.  I was out.  I have no idea what's going on right now.  I come back here.  You not only saw a train wreck, you are one. 
[02:32:00]  Sam, he doesn't even know what's going on.  I was out getting breakfast for Voss.  And what happened?  I come back.  What did you see and not take a picture of?  There's a half-eaten donut in here.  It smells weird in here.  Danny's talking up the records.  He's talking up records today.  Here's what you do.  I'll just give it to me like this.  It's gonna be a little tighter than that.  All right.  1979 hit music.  You know, it's gonna take a lot of love as we get through the weekend together.  But it's gonna be a lot easier because we're celebrating Tequila and Donuts Day here on the ONA Show.  It's a Friday morning. 
[02:32:30]  Nice to have you along.  Make sure you keep it right here on SiriusXM.  Go ahead, Nicolette.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right there.  He's fucking good, man.  Stinky.  You like Denny?  Denny, that's good, man.  We got Stinky in here.  Stinky!  Stinky!  I am such a fucking, I appreciate the old school radio.  So to see a guy work in it, I like it.  He's pretty good at it.  I practice in the car all the time.  Do you?  Right.  You talk up songs in the car?  And I'm one of the guys I used to have my air check on.  Right, yeah.  I would pull up to a light, put it in the cassette deck. 
[02:33:00]  Sure.  And then turn it up.  Oh.  Practice in the car as you try to figure out how you're gonna pay your cable bill.  I practice my racial slurs in the car.  I'm getting very good at it.  I would just yell out, I'm available for private parties.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Have you guys heard his spot-on Ira impression?  Ira the weatherman?  Do you do a good Ira?  How you doing?  I think you'd walk in.  Hi, how you doing?  Do you know there's a new country station?  I listen to satellite radio, Ira.  Well, is Cousin Brucey live tonight?  It's like he's here.  It's spot-on, that one. 
[02:33:30]  That was spot-on.  Stinky, you want a shot of tequila?  Never.  You said yes?  Yeah, I'll take one.  Oh, shit!  Stinky!  Fucking goddamn.  I didn't think Tequila Day would be a hit, eh?  You know what?  I love to be proven wrong.  I was with you on this one.  Well, I don't.  You don't really like to be proven wrong ever.  What are you talking about?  Neither one of us like to be proven wrong.  Right, you are.  But I will say we have been proven wrong, because I'm agreeing with you on this. 
[02:34:00]  I didn't think Tequila and Donuts Friday was going to have legs.  I'm okay with being proven wrong.  I'll give you that much.  Okay.  I'm okay with it.  I am prepared by it.  A lot of money.  That stammer's worth a lot of money.  Iraq, do you have another one?  Yes, I do.  And Stinky?  Iraq, this is five for you?  This is four.  He didn't do his fourth.  Oh, he didn't do his fourth.  Oh, is that the one where you said, oh, I poured a little too much?  Yeah.  By the way, Stinky enjoying both Donut and Tequila on Tequila Donut Day. 
[02:34:30]  Tequila Donut Day.  Who wouldn't like the combination?  Because I were here today.  It goes together like fucking oil and water.  830.  Can we get him to do a shot of tequila?  Hmm.  Oh, that would be nice.  Drink scotch.  Jay would have my balls.  I'm a scotch drinker.  I kind of rebuilt the bridge with Jay Thomas.  Do you drink tequila?  Right before the holidays.  Never.  Dennis, you're leaving us again?  This is just...  Daddy!  I got to work on the Herman's Hermits show.  We do Peter Noon every Saturday afternoon.  Something tells me I'm meant for something good. 
[02:35:00]  Wait, did you hear this shit?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Peter Noon from Herman's Hermits does a show for us on the 60s on 6.  Oh, dude.  On Saturday afternoons, 4 o'clock Eastern time.  What could he possibly do with that show?  Well, he's got a lot of recollections about the 60s and the British Invasion music.  Remember I was telling you about people getting shows?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It doesn't fucking matter whether you're trying to go on the radio, they'll give you a show.  And you know, a lot of the British Invasion music has its roots in the R&B music of the  50s.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you know a lot of good stuff in there, too.  The crickets don't even care. 
[02:35:30]  Buddy Holly and the crickets?  I know.  See?  A lot of great stuff.  He didn't know that.  He just meant the cricket sounds.  But yeah, yeah.  Buddy Holly and the crickets.  You want to talk about some Herman's Hermits?  He's got some...  Yeah, sure.  Get some Herman's Hermits.  What song?  Which one?  How about Mrs. Brown?  You've got a lovely...  Ah, Mrs. Brown, you've got...  Yeah.  Not much of an intro, I don't think, on that one.  I'll take care of it for you.  I'll take care of it for you.  Here we go.  You got that one in there for me?  Oh, boy.  Flash?  Come on, Flash.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Sal's just panicking.  Sal.  Sal, you've got to pick up that I haven't even been drinking. 
[02:36:00]  Sal, this is why, you know, we're trading you.  E-Rock is celebrating.  So obvious.  I got it.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  Wait for his cue.  Give it to me.  Sirius XM, the 60s on 6.  Don't forget, tomorrow afternoon, 5 o'clock Eastern Time, it's Peter Noon here on the Something  Good Show.  This is Brown.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  What happened?  It was a little abrupt, though.  I hit it right there.  He did hit it.  You know what I used to say?  I'd say, hey, Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter, and you're not so bad yourself.  You know? 
[02:36:30]  Then he goes, you know?  You know?  You know?  Yeah.  This is great.  What you could do in the oldies radio field, you'd have those good lines on index cards,  and you'd rotate them.  And you would just rotate them?  Well, yeah, every once in a while.  Did you ever do the one, uh, uh, they ain't, they ain't, wait, they ain't related, but  they do be brothers.  That's a good one.  That was a big one, too.  Write that one down.  They ain't related, but they do be brothers.  You remember that, or I got an index card with that on it, O?  I actually did that one.  I'm embarrassed to say I did that one.  You know, it's a good one that I heard on an air check from a guy out at KING in Seattle. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  He was playing, uh, Love on a Two-Way Street by The Moments.  Uh-huh.  Of course.  He said, I've got Love on a Two-Way Street, but that don't mean that I go both ways.  Whoa!  That's a gay bashing joke.  I love it.  I thought that was a little homophobic.  I thought that was a little blue, so I didn't want to do that.  Hey, love on a two-way street, but my asshole's one way.  You missed what you said.  What happened?  He goes, I don't do that.  I was a little blue.  A little blue.  A little blue.  A little blue.  Yeah, that was left to, like, the overnight guys, right? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  We always made sure that the overnight guys cleaned the cart machines.  That was their job?  Clean the cart machines and emptied the coffee pot.  All right.  I was that guy.  Oh, OB.  I cleaned the coffee pots in Buffalo, and I did clean the carts.  I know exactly what he was talking about.  Yeah, I'd take the alcohol with the Q-tip.  With the big Q-tip.  You're fucking beating me up right now.  I remember cleaning the cart machines at fucking AAF.  That was my job when I did overnights in Buffalo.  Well, one of the guys who used to smoke in the studio, then the glass.  You'd wipe the glass down. 
[02:38:00]  Brown.  Brown.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy knows his shit.  What are some of the other go-to lines?  The go-to lines.  Hey, the weekend's here.  Hey, thank God for Friday.  TGIF.  Hey, thank God it's Friday.  And if you had a morning man whose name was Frank, he used to say, hey, TGIF, thank God  it's Frank.  He'll be here tomorrow morning at 5 o'clock.  Bright, light, and early.  He used to have the cliches.  Yeah, of course.  Is that what they called him?  He's great.  I love this.  The cliches.  Denny.  Denny.  Fucking Dennis is fantastic with this radio history. 
[02:38:30]  But the thing on Friday is you don't want to talk about Monday because you don't want  people to get down.  People want to enjoy the weekend.  They're feeling up on a Friday.  So don't mention Monday.  Don't mention Monday.  But what do you mention on Mondays?  You mention Monday, 3 o'clock on Sunday afternoon because then people start putting themselves  into a Monday point of view.  Yeah, I feel bad.  Research has shown Sunday at 3 p.m. is when people start thinking about Monday.  Yeah, 3 o'clock.  You start going like, ah, tomorrow's work.  But what do you do on Monday to get them through?  Because now they're like, ah, fuck, it's Monday. 
[02:39:00]  Wednesday.  Think of Wednesday.  Get over the hump day.  Don't forget.  Wednesday will be giving away concert tickets.  Oh, so there's something to look forward to.  What do you do on Monday, though?  But that's good.  It's something to look forward to on a Monday.  Oh, you push Wednesdays.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see.  And then Wednesday, you start getting into the weekend, mind.  Right.  Don't forget, Friday, 5 o'clock, we start the British Invasion Weekend.  All your favorites from those British years.  I hope he just keeps cringing.  I was kind of in the world for a while.  You remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  It's fantastic.  God bless you guys.  I like it.  All right.  Well, I do have to say, guys. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, do the shots, then.  Here they go.  Snake and E-Rock fucking clinking coffee cups with tequila in it.  Oh, yeah.  How is it, Garrett?  It's horrible.  Is it terrible?  Why is it horrible?  Why is it worse?  Because it's so early.  It's early.  Yeah, yeah.  E-Rock felt that one.  You should have seen his face.  Yeah.  I think it's four.  E-Rock's eyes are all glassy now.  Four impressive shots, though.  Yeah.  Impressive.  Yeah.  Look at the bottle.  We should go to the diner after this for grilled cheese, hash browns, and some home fries,  right?  That's right. 
[02:40:00]  Hash browns and gravy.  All-American radio kind of breakfast.  All right, Danny.  That's good, Dan.  Thank you.  And you know what a good thing is?  When you go to a restaurant, you'd call up.  You'd tell the waitress you work at the radio station.  And you'd call back, and you'd say, oh, give a shout-out.  I'm down here at, you know, so-and-so, the Starlight Diner.  Hey, you'll like this one, Danny.  Oh, and then you get there.  You know what Scorch used to do to waitresses?  Oh.  A waitress would be like, uh...  Pop him in the ass?  Well, he'd try it.  The waitress would go, hey, uh, aren't you on the radio?  Well, yes.  And then Scorch would say, no, I'm right here. 
[02:40:30]  Ah, see, because...  You can have that one, Danny.  Oh, yeah.  Danny, you take that.  Enjoy that line, okay?  Yeah.  There goes, Danny.  It means something else here, though.  All right, Dan, thanks.  Where'd Iraq go?  I thought we were going to do some...  He is a little piece of radio history right there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, it's so funny.  That's a little blue.  But it doesn't mean I go both ways.  Holy shit.  I swear I don't know what's going on.  It's amazing. 
[02:41:00]  It's tequila day.  Tequila and donut day.  It's tequila and donut day.  That's all you need to know.  Where'd Iraq go to?  I don't know.  Iraq.  Oh, shit, where is he?  Sal doesn't know where he is today.  He's MIA.  He just wandered off.  He just walked off.  Toward the bathroom?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  He might have the donut chips.  Someone's going there.  He might be puking, maybe.  Sal's going to look.  Maybe that last shot has him with the donuts and the shot.  He looked fucked up after the last one.  Dude, his eyes were tearing up.  I know it's Z-Rock, but he hasn't eaten yet, really.  He's only had the two donuts.  He hasn't grazed yet.  Really start grazing.  Yeah.  Then he's a trip. 
[02:41:30]  He is...  You know what?  I've never said more than two words to the guy or heard him.  He's usually like, hey, you catch the game last night.  I'm like, yeah, if I can, you know, oh, Yankees.  He's one of the nicer guys around here.  Yeah.  But to hear him, I didn't know he was very involved with the music stations.  I do...  That's why when we came to New York, so many people hated us, especially in the business,  because we weren't following the mold of the radio guy.  No.  And they also knew if we were successful, a lot of those guys would have to go.  Exactly. 
[02:42:00]  Do you rock?  Where did you run off to?  Do you rock?  What happened?  I had to pay.  Oh, did you?  Is it the tequila?  Well, I didn't get to go last break, so...  What?  All right.  How do you feel?  I mean, is Tequila Donut Day doing well?  It's doing well.  I really thought it was going to be a bust.  You know what?  I thought it was going to be a complete bust.  Right.  And Dennis to come in.  It's just been...  Who's next?  It's a party.  I'm going to go find some more people.  Find some more people for tequila?  Are you feeling it?  I'm feeling it.  You are a little bit?  In what way, you rock?  I'm very hot. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, you're very...  Yeah, look at his face.  It's all red.  Yeah, you're a little red.  Take off your hoodie.  A little red.  Take off your shirt, dude.  It's Tequila Friday.  Whatever.  Let your hair down.  Nice.  Take your pants off.  It's all good.  It's all good.  We've got to film something in the elevator today.  Oh, E-Rock Drunk E-Rock Elevator Show.  We'll figure something out.  I need a new show for next week.  Yeah.  I went with an old show yesterday because I was too busy with all the shit.  Never.  But we'll have a brand new episode next week.  Travis, how do you feel? 
[02:43:00]  I'm fine.  Travis?  You're not going to get fired.  You had nothing to do with this.  Tequila or donut?  I'm not going to get fired.  Eric's a senior producer.  I'm a producer.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Nobody's going to get fired on a Tequila Friday.  Get out of here.  This is two hours of content.  It's a party.  This is sanctioned by E-Rock.  I swear I don't even know if this is good.  It's good.  I love it.  It's so weird.  I thought Dennis had a great first appearance.  You know what?  Dennis rules.  You're right.  That was Dennis' first appearance on the program, and I think he nailed it.  He nailed it.  He's talking those songs up.  He's adding in the little tidbits of information about the music. 
[02:43:30]  Eric is sweating, by the way.  Yeah.  E-Rock, are you sweating?  I'm hot.  Yeah.  Your cheeks are all red.  And, yeah.  It's just strange because it's not that warm in here.  No.  No, I turned the air conditioner around.  Yeah, it's pretty good today.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  This is great.  This is a good Friday show.  I feel sorry for Danny.  Why is that?  I know a lot of guys.  I mean, radio is a tough fucking road, man.  It is.  Really tough fucking road.  Yes, it is.  And I was making no money when I started out on radio, and I did the mobile DJing thing. 
[02:44:00]  I fucking hated it.  I had to do two in a night sometimes.  I did at least two a weekend minimum, but sometimes it was like four in a weekend.  I had to go to this guy's house.  He had a garage, and he would set up all the DJ equipment, and my name would be on it.  Like, all right, this is yours.  I had to pile it into my little Honda Accord.  This brings back memories.  And I could barely see as I'm driving down the road because I have so much shit.  Oh, man.  And then I have to go to the gig and set it up, and I was never that good at that, so I 
[02:44:30]  was always stressed trying to figure it out with the portable speakers and everything.  And then, like, half the people didn't even give a fuck you were there.  The bar was trying something new, and all of a sudden you had to awkwardly, like, go on  mic and try to get something going.  And then you'd deal with the drunks and stuff.  And then the bar or the establishment would close down.  You had to break down your own equipment and then drive all the way back to this guy's  house and put it back in his garage.  I fucking hated it.  I more liked when you were giving away roses at the Exxon in Islandia. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, I love that.  And I'd come driving up in my Apollo work van.  Boy, what a meeting of the fucking amazing Opie and Anthony radio show those used to  be.  I'd pull up in my work van because I heard Opie on the radio, like, fucking going to  be in Islandia at the Exxon station giving away roses.  That's the BAB days, right?  And I'd pull up, and it's like, Opie, how you doing?  You know?  And I, you know, he's giving away roses, and I had to go off to fucking an attic somewhere.  How fucked up and bad.  That was easy, though.  That was easy compared to fucking setting up mobile DJ equipment. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God, did I hate that.  I was so glad that I actually quit that.  I just couldn't handle it.  I decided I'll just be poor and deal with the money I was making.  He rock comment?  Did you ever mobile DJ?  No.  You ever DJ?  No.  No.  And there's guys out there that do it, and they do it very well.  I was absolutely not that guy.  I just fucking hated it.  Troy Kwan.  He can DJ.  Yeah, but he doesn't have to, like, set up his shit.  That's what I mean.  These were low-level, who-gives-a-fuck gigs. 
[02:46:00]  So degrading.  It is.  It was.  You're a radio guy, and then you go to an event.  Like, you get hired for a birthday party or an anniversary or something, and you see them  from, like, the oldie station or the classic rock station, and they're just spinning dance  music for you.  And didn't you just have to carry crates of records?  All that.  So it was just records back then when I was doing it.  Wait, tons.  Dude, the amount of equipment I had to pop into my Honda Accord.  Now you get a fucking computer, a little laptop, and you're fucking, you're spinning.  Yeah, I'm a DJ. 
[02:46:30]  I'm a DJ.  I fucking have a laptop, and I press the fucking button.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That's fucked up right there, yo.  You're mad that the Peter Noonan guy?  Peter Noon.  Peter Noon is?  It's just Noon.  Noon.  Peter Noon guy has a show here, too.  It's him.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  It's so annoying, isn't it?  As long as you don't spend any time trying to figure out how to do a radio show, like,  as long as you don't work in radio, you've got a pretty good shot at getting a show here.  Yeah.  Like, if you've got any notoriety for doing anything, whether you at one point were a 
[02:47:00]  singer.  As long as it's not radio.  As long as it's not radio, then you can get a show.  Then you get a show.  And let me tell you the other side of it, because now that he's our pal.  Denny.  Denny does everything for that fucking show and gets paid nothing.  Of course.  And they just give Peter Noon the big fucking fat paycheck.  Well, yeah.  Because he's a name.  You've got to get the radio guys to produce these shows.  Right.  And they pretend that they're not miserable.  So they get the actual radio guy that knows what the fuck he's doing that could do exactly  what Peter Noon's doing, by the way.  Better. 
[02:47:30]  But because Peter Noon has the name, he gets the big fucking paycheck.  And then, you know, Denny, all fucked up on tequila, has to put the show together.  But, like, Marky Ramon has a show.  Just because he's, like, the last of the Ramon.  Ramon.  Yeah.  And, and, and...  I know it goes into...  They don't come cheap.  I know it goes into Marky Ramon's show.  I know what Marky does, and I know what his producer does.  Because I talk to his producer.  Yeah.  What does Marky do?  Marky shows up and says what, literally word for word, what his producer tells him to.  And, and then they mix it together. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  And then, yeah, and then he has to go back and make it sound like something.  Right.  But he's not sitting...  Marky, he's out of here.  He's not sitting there listening to the songs, waiting for it to end so he could pop in.  No.  I don't think he knows a single one.  Uh-huh.  Like, these specialty DJs, they do maybe an hour's work a week.  Yeah, they go into a studio, they record some lines, and then a producer...  And then the actual radio guy has put the whole thing together.  Puts it together.  Pieces it together, like a puzzle.  But you don't even need that much notoriety.  You could launch a popular website, and you'll get a radio show if you want one. 
[02:48:30]  If you want one.  Buzzfeed.  Whoever.  You know what, uh, you know who I like?  You know who I like?  I like the fucking, uh, original VJs that they got here.  Because I'll see, like, fucking Mark Goodman out by the computers, and he's actually doing  some work.  Right.  No, he's not.  I don't know what it is, but he's doing something.  There's nothing new that comes out of the 80s.  But he's there on the computer.  What kind of work could it be?  He's on the computer.  He's just announcing people who've died.  He's tall.  You think he's just looking up obituaries for fucking 80s guys?  Let me make sure this guy's still alive. 
[02:49:00]  Fucking, yeah, yeah.  Oh, is, uh, fucking, what's his name?  Tommy Two-Tone dead?  Yeah, he is.  Let me, let me see what happened to the 8-6-7-5-3-0-9 guy.  Yeah.  Tommy Two-Tone's dead.  Oh, he's done?  Yep.  That's too bad.  Or like, hey.  I've been waiting for that second hit for a while.  Yeah.  Yo, hey, come on in.  Hey.  Why are they walking by?  Hey.  Come in.  Come on.  At least say hi.  Oh, come on.  What's the matter?  Come in and say hi.  Come on.  Ah.  It's Tequila and Donut Friday. 
[02:49:30]  It's Tequila and Donut Friday.  But who, because he said?  Because E-Rock said?  Hey, we got Denny to do a shot.  Because you said.  I never said that.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Because you said.  Did you have tequila yet?  Because it sounds like it.  Nah, nah, nah.  Because you said.  I never said it was Tequila Friday.  By the way.  How about one shot?  No.  You know one shot won't do much.  No, no.  We got Denny to do a shot.  No.  Rich, you're going to do one, right?  I'll do a shot if someone else does one with me.  Just so E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  And by the way.  You're looking at Rich Davis.  Yeah.  The last person to work in radio to get a radio show.  Rich Davis, everybody. 
[02:50:00]  That's Joe.  That's Joe.  Last person.  Last one.  The next.  An actual radio guy that got a radio show.  Now, if you had some kind of a singing career, maybe you were an actor, maybe you're an  airline pilot, any other profession besides radio, you get a radio gig now.  Every radio job I left, I was replaced by automation or like a celebrity host.  A celebrity host.  Right, right.  Nicole's body language is saying, I ain't doing no fucking tequila.  I am not.  I mean, that makes me nervous right now.  You want a bump?  Nicole, it's Tequila Friday. 
[02:50:30]  I thought you were.  Come on, Tequila Friday.  I thought you were a party girl.  I am, but I'm not feeling good.  Well, that's why it's Tequila and Donut Day.  What?  You don't like the smell of tequila?  This is E-Rock's fifth shot of tequila.  Through the teeth over the gums.  He's going to be throwing up later.  And fired.  That's nice.  All right.  Tequila and Donut Friday.  I hope you don't get fired.  I will.  Fired?  I will.  He goes, I will.  Can't get fired for this. 
[02:51:00]  All right, there goes the morning mashup.  Morning mashup.  The show's all about you guys, by the way.  The other two.  Yeah, fuck them.  Fuck them.  Look at her Uggs.  They're giant.  Oh, I thought you meant her feet.  Her Uggs.  Yeah, she's got Uggs on even when she's not wearing Uggs.  I thought she was walking around barefoot.  If E-Rock gets fired, maybe they'll replace the host of The Weekend Countdown with somebody  who wrote an interesting article in Cosmo.  Oh, wow.  You're a little bitter, Sam.  You're too young to be bitter.  Maybe the guy who played with Billy Joel. 
[02:51:30]  That kid could have a show.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Don't even fuck around, because they would give him a show in a heartbeat.  Which channel would he get?  OutQ?  Yeah, he could be on any channel.  If he's like, oh, you know I'm a Bruce fan?  Yeah.  Oh, how would you like to do a daily show on the Bruce channel?  Oh, okay.  All right.  I saw the OutQ guys.  They were walking down the long hall.  Yeah.  Heard the commotion, and I saw them both turn around.  I don't know if it had anything to do with us, but I'm thinking people are now starting  to avoid our tequila donut day.  Is this getting talk scuttlebutt around the building, much like Kenny's walking us 
[02:52:00]  to the bathroom thing?  I think so.  E-Rock and me are both, during the breaks, going spot to spot, looking for people.  Looking for people that want to participate.  You know this show likes a good list.  I think we've got to start a list for Tequila and Donut Day.  Get on that, Schindler.  You start working on that list.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get Rich Vos in here next.  Maybe we can knock him off that pesky sobriety.  Have him do a fucking shot. 
[02:52:30]  Tequila donut day, you gave it a solid B.  Where are we at now, though?  You might have to be up in that to a B+.  Dude, with the amount of people that are coming in, the festive party atmosphere, the  amount of donuts that have been eaten.  You can't give it an A officially yet.  I'm giving it a strong B+.  Strong B+.  Strong B+.  Now, the audio portion of your...  The Tequila and Donut Day list has begun with the takers.  Sex Man has done five shots.  Five shots.  Denny, the golden voice of Sirius and Joe, has done three shots. 
[02:53:00]  Stinky has done one shot.  And Rick...  Rich Davis.  Sorry, Rich Davis.  Is he the Rich from Covino and Rich?  Yes, he is.  Oh, I didn't know that.  But that's the trick.  I didn't even want to bring that up to him.  Right.  Even because he works in radio, to get a nice paycheck, they make him do a morning and afternoon  show.  He's got to do the two.  But do you realize...  The Hermits guy, one hour a week.  Yeah.  And I guarantee he makes way more money than Rich Davis.  Do you realize if he was a software mogul, how much he could make in radio by getting  his own show on Sirius Tech or something? 
[02:53:30]  Do they have that?  They would create Sirius Tech.  What about Roland?  Oh, Roland did a shot.  Oh, Rolando did a shot.  Yes.  But he did his own tequila because he's, of course, always promoting.  The Clooney.  He was promoting George Clooney's tequila.  I hear I have a bottle of the Clooney tequila waiting for me, which I will bring home.  And this evening, I might have to partake, you know, when you're supposed to drink at  night. 
[02:54:00]  Dan's telling everyone that.  On a Friday night.  Yeah.  And that's coming from me.  Not at work.  All right.  No.  Morning mashup is coming back down the hall.  Should we ask him again?  Stanley T might be good for...  Nah.  Oh, Stanley T ain't going to drink.  Yeah.  We don't have the right liquor for him.  Oh, shit.  Stanley T!  All right.  One more.  Yeah, let's go.  One more.  One more.  Why don't you offer people, maybe there's a better angle, Mexican coffee.  He's doing coffee with a shot of tequila.  That might be good.  Well, we have coffee tequila.  E-Rock, why don't you break out the other tequila?  It's about time.  All right.  We have the coffee flavor tequila. 
[02:54:30]  There's some coffee tequila.  I can't.  I wish I could.  No?  No.  Ah, shit.  Breakfast tequila.  A little breakfast tequila.  It's good stuff.  You guys eat tequila eggs, donuts?  What the hell's wrong with you guys?  It's like fucking donuts.  It's tequila.  It's tequila.  It's got the real deal, though.  Tequila donut.  Yeah, it's a Patron.  Patron going on.  Patron's some good shit right there.  Is that why all these rappers are lined up out here?  Yeah.  See you later.  All right, Stanley T.  Oh, man.  Nice ass.  Looking more and more like a black nerd these days, Stanley T.  What's that about?  He really is.  He's going for the nerd look.  Look at Rich. 
[02:55:00]  Looks like a bum.  He looks like a vagabond or something.  He looks like he's from another fucking era.  Yeah, he does.  He looks like a thug from the fucking 30s.  Yes.  Yeah, he's got his little hat.  All right, we're going to break Rich Vossen here.  It's seeping through.  Uh-oh.  Is the lid off your water?  How are you feeling, Iraq?  Iraq, what's up?  Get on mic there.  I feel nice.  Just nice?  You feel nice.  Yeah, but like black slang.  Like, I'm nice right now.  Dude, he did five shots of tequila in one hour. 
[02:55:30]  This only started an hour ago.  That means we've got to bring Denny back.  Denny!  Denny!  Denny!  So what are your plans once you leave here and go home today?  Drive, drive.  Yeah, what are you going to do after the show?  Because you're going to have the big crash.  You're going to sneak off somewhere and sleep it off a little bit.  Did you have plans for Friday night with the wife, maybe?  Friday night.  No, not tonight, no.  What are you going to do?  What would be a good Friday night for you, an Iraq that has no plans?  What? 
[02:56:00]  It would probably be movies, go to sleep.  Yeah?  Nothing exciting.  No?  Play with video games?  Nah.  How is he not more fucked up?  I'm a little confused.  He is.  He is.  He's trying not to talk a lot.  If you notice, there's a lot of one and two answer fucking, one and two word answers here.  Let's have him read something.  He just tapped himself on the nose.  He barely made it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse. 
[02:56:30]  More of Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013.  Worst in 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  For those of you that just joined us, Dennis works with the 60s and some of the music channels.  We call it the Decades channels.  The Decades channels.  And Cousin Brucie.  And Cousin Brucie.  And that's why earlier we played some Vanilla Fudge and we were just getting into the whole 
[02:57:00]  vibe of the 60s music.  You ever just kick back in a bubble bath, maybe with a significant other, just listening to  the 60s, drinking a little wine.  Like your dad.  Do you do that?  In the Poconos.  In the Poconos?  In the champagne glasses?  The champagne glasses.  The giant champagne glasses with the bubbles?  We couldn't write.  Oh, that's romantical.  We couldn't write a better character than Denny.  I know.  You know that, right, Sam?  Of course.  So you want to talk about what record for St. Patrick's Day?  How about the unicorn?  You got the unicorn? 
[02:57:30]  The Irish one.  You rock?  Wasn't that a party, Dave?  Wasn't that a party?  That's a good one.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Slow down, Denny.  Slow down.  Listen.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I also want to tell people it's tequila and donut day.  I don't know why, but it is.  E-Rock surprised us with this today.  I thought it was going to be a complete bust, and I am completely wrong.  Here's what I think.  E-Rock had a tough night and wanted to get drunk.  And so he made up.  His refrigerator broke.  And Rich Voss is in here, and he brought his A material, so watch out.  Watch out.  He was bashing us before the mics even went on. 
[02:58:00]  Whoa, man.  He's got a couple zingers in.  If E-Rock does another shot, Denny will.  Denny, would you do another shot?  You're three shots in.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  I think we ought to call him T-Rock today.  That's right.  For tequila.  T-Rock.  Oh, T-Rock.  Well, let's let him talk up some records before we do that.  T-Rock, coma.  T-Rock.  Well, it's only 8.40, 20 till 9.  Do you guys do double time checks?  You should do that.  They're called double time checks?  Double time checks, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  I love them.  8.40, 20 till 9.  And that's called a double time check.  You should do that.  The smooth voice is wonderful.  I'm surprised you guys don't stand up.  You get a lot of better energy.  Do you normally stand when you're broadcasting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he only talks 20 seconds an hour.  Imagine standing for four fucking hours.  We talk four hours every morning there, Denny.  Here's what our breaks would be.  Yo, my legs are tired.  How about yours?  Yeah, fucking exhausted.  I'm getting that twitchy thing in my kneecap.  We really don't care what our voices are like.  Fucking Denny looks like the guy in Beetlejuice after he got his head shrunk. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, man, Rich.  Rich.  Coming from a 30s gangster, that's quite the insult.  Is that a Burberry hat?  Huh?  Is that a Burberry hat?  No, it's fucking Marshall.  Go fucking.  Marshall?  I was going to say it.  It's nice.  Yeah, it is Burberry.  Can I see your hat?  No, you can't see it.  Damn it!  Can we do tequila shots at your hat?  Where's the Irish Rovers?  Oh, of course.  The Irish Rovers.  Come on.  Come on.  I got that on my hard drive of hits, you know.  You want to do what's on my hard drive of hits? 
[02:59:30]  I love this guy.  What's a hard drive of hits?  Well, it's all in the music that I carry for my weekend gigs.  Yeah, I understand, but why call it the hard drive of hits?  Because I have all the music.  You remember albums, having to take albums to the gigs, right?  We used to put them in the milk crates.  In the milk crates.  Yeah.  You used to put them on the hair truck and bring them in.  And what a pain in the ass, right?  You had to do it, you know?  You had to bring the right music.  And every time you would take out the album, it's like somebody, you say, you know, I haven't  played George Thorogren in a while.  I'm not going to need it.  The next day, some guy goes, hey, you got Born to be Bad? 
[03:00:00]  You know, I just played it just before you got here.  Damn.  That's smart.  I just picked up the Bangladesh album.  Bangladesh.  No, you can't dance to them, though.  You can't dance to them.  Bangladesh.  When you advertise, Denny, when you advertise, do you advertise with Denny comes the hard  drive of hits?  No, they just get it.  That is pretty good.  I can see that on a batter.  That's pretty terrific.  What's your selling point?  Denny and the hard drive of hits.  It's just the personality.  You know, I just keep the music.  Do you have a slug line?  I play the music. 
[03:00:30]  I just make the music better.  Do you say, I let the music do the talking?  We let the music do the talking.  We play the music that you want.  Oh.  Because, Sam, you and your wife, you and your future wife.  No, I'm married.  We're almost a year now.  We're just setting the scenario now.  You guys are the main customers, so you guys tell me the songs to play.  More importantly, the songs you don't want me to play.  Yeah.  Oh.  Like, we've been to 88 weddings.  We don't want to hear Celebration.  Right.  1980 hit music by Cool and the Gang.  Put back that ass up back on.  Something like that.  Well, I don't play any music with any suggestive lyrics. 
[03:01:00]  That's a little blue.  Because we've got the kids.  Right, the kids.  You've got to think of the kids.  It doesn't work blue, Ed.  It doesn't work blue.  So he wants to talk about what?  The unicorn?  You want to do that, or wasn't that a party?  Yeah, wasn't that a party?  Okay.  We could do two.  We could do a twofer.  Scott and Todd play that every Friday.  Whoa!  After that, he'll talk up niggas in Paris.  No, no, that's just not.  No, Denny?  No.  It's the N-word part of your vocabulary.  No, you can't use it, because we've got communion season coming up.  Plus, they shouldn't be in Paris.  You know there's communion season. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know anything.  Yeah, it's busy.  Sometimes we'll be doing two jobs in one day.  It gets crazy.  Really?  It gets crazy.  You're DJ at the communions, right?  Yeah, we bring the hula hoops, the limbo pole.  And your fucking...  Musical chairs.  Do you bring them out?  Like, hey, let's bring out the brand new...  Do you also bring a noose?  Because I'm fucking at my son.  And the clown couch has got to be fun.  Dude, look what Denny used to look like.  There you go.  You like the mustache and everything?  What the fuck, Denny?  What year is that?  That would be 1989.  1989? 
[03:02:00]  Ushering in the new decade.  That was in Brooklyn.  I think I was playing Donna Summer.  This time I know it's for real.  Oh.  He knows what he was playing.  Music to go-go.  For all occasions.  Is it still the same phone number?  No.  Oh.  No.  Well, what's your...  Do you want to get the...  DennisFalcone.com.  I just keep it nice and simple.  Are you related to Rob Falcone?  No.  You remember Pete Falcone used to pitch for the Mets?  No.  I'm not related to him either.  That's a good one.  He's got to be funny, too, when he's doing this. 
[03:02:30]  He is funny.  He really is.  He's a great guy.  Well, you know what?  After a slow dance, I always say, now make sure you give that person your dancing with  a nice big hug and a kiss.  Then I take a beat, and I go, make sure you introduce yourself.  Because they couldn't be dancing with somebody who...  We're trying to figure that out.  That gets them all the time.  We're trying to figure that out.  That gets them all the time.  This is not a character, Rich.  No, no, no.  This is great.  I love this guy.  I loved him on the Munsters.  He was...  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Rich.  Oh, Rich. 
[03:03:00]  You've got to.  You're trying to make yourself feel better, aren't you?  All right.  Let's have a talk up an Irish song.  Let's have a talk up one of our Irish songs for St. Patrick's Day.  Which one do you want?  Unicorn or...  St. Patrick's Day.  I said we do both.  St. Unicorn.  Double shot.  Unicorn?  Yeah.  Let's do Unicorn first.  Two in a row the way to go.  Don't forget to praise this weekend.  You can work that into the fucking talk up here.  That's right.  Tell me when you want it.  Hey, it's the 60s on 6.  Let's go back in time with the Irish Rovers.  Make sure you bring your umbrella tomorrow because it could rain.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I stepped on it.  You stepped on it. 
[03:03:30]  Danny.  Oh, man.  That's okay.  I would just say morning.  Is that what you say when you step on something?  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Give me the other one.  Give me the other one.  Give me the other one.  Watch how he rolls up his sleeve.  Come on now.  I love it.  It's his thing.  These are the Rovers that used to be known as the Irish Rovers, but baby, we are having  a party.  Perfect.  That's good, man.  That was right on the money.  I remember this from my Geneseo days. 
[03:04:00]  Great song.  Everybody get those hands up.  Yeah.  I thought you really meant it.  That's pretty good.  Everybody here is Irish today.  We're all Irish today.  Oh, that stuff.  Nice.  Yeah.  So we should be drinking then.  Well, Iraq should.  Go back to our list, Sam.  Have you added to the list?  Well, right now, it's Tequila and Donut Day in the no thanks column.  Right.  We're at Nicole, Stan, and probably the OutQ guys. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  And Opie and Anthony, believe it or not.  Well, yeah.  Add us to the list.  You got to get some guys from the sports channels.  Yeah.  They're big drinkers.  They're big drinkers.  The football guys want to come in.  I am.  And Taylor from Cosmo, they're coming in at 9 o'clock when they're done.  Yeah.  All right.  We might need another bottle of tequila.  Well, we got the coffee.  Taylor can party.  She hangs out with Nicole.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is she the one with the rough voice?  Yep.  She gets somebody from the country channels because they have that hit called Pour Me Another  Tequila, Sheila. 
[03:05:00]  You want to talk that one up?  Is that a good one?  I don't know that one.  He doesn't know country very much, right?  I'm not a big country guy.  I like country.  Oh, who doesn't?  I like the country crossovers.  Is that Eddie Rabbit?  Oh, yeah.  The crossover hits.  You don't play character no matter where you're working.  This isn't a character.  Oh, you know what?  This is him.  I work with companies who do the characters, too.  Yeah.  Like we have Mickey Mouse and you can't call him Barney.  Call him the purple dinosaur because of infringement.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of infringement.  Like I could see you doing like my mom's nursing home where they're just all fucking  like drooling and all out of... 
[03:05:30]  You do those?  Oh, yeah.  They love that.  They love the music.  Yeah, I know.  Because you know what?  It's not like I go out there and every DJ today just brings hip-hop music.  Yeah, I know.  But I bring the hits.  I bring...  Do you finger pop any of the old broads when they're not looking?  Tom Jones.  No.  All the good songs.  Barry Manilow.  Like there was a guy that did Sinatra hits at my mom's nursing home.  And let me tell you...  He sings?  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't like computers fucking up on me here.  No, he plays the hits.  What did you say he rocked?  I have pour me another tequila if he wants that one. 
[03:06:00]  No, I really don't know that one, but you know what?  We could play that for all the guys on the country channel.  Well, play it anyway.  All right.  Watch it.  What's the ramp time on there?  You got an intro time?  Oh, it's called a ramp time.  Nope.  You'll have to figure it out.  All right.  You can figure it out.  You're a pro, Danny.  You're a pro.  I guess so.  All right.  Let's do this for Tequila and Donut Day.  It's Tequila and Donut Day here on the O&A Show on a Friday.  A frantic Friday as we have one great song after another.  And pour me another tequila, Sheila, here on the countryside.  We've still got some ramp time here. 
[03:06:30]  You don't have all these things printed out?  We've still got some ramp time here.  So ramp time.  How many seconds was it?  I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention.  Yeah, but you could have figured it out for good old Denny.  I don't care.  I need some show prep.  Why don't you go fuck yourself?  It comes around twice.  What's on this weekend?  We've got show prep right here in this bottle, Denny.  That's right, Denny.  A bottle full of prep.  Some lifestyle stuff.  People go into the movies this weekend.  Things to do with the kids.  Oh, what's on the movies?  That magician movie comes out this weekend. 
[03:07:00]  Bird Wonderstone.  And it's St. Patrick's Day.  St. Patrick's Day.  And it's, let's see.  And it's Tequila Friday, for God's sake.  You want a donut?  Oh, thanks.  I had a bite.  You did?  Yeah.  So you're partaking?  What is that?  The LIE exit 58?  I don't know.  I'm not MapQuest.  I'm just going out there.  I don't know what you're going to.  It's Bohemia.  Do you know where it is?  Yeah, sure.  Right off the LIE.  Yeah, 58.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's right after Vets Highway.  Veterans Highway.  Veterans Highway.  I'm a Jersey guy.  Traffic backing up right now around there. 
[03:07:30]  You're going to be tapping the brakes as you come up to exit 56.  There you go.  Yeah.  Make sure you slow down.  Yeah, slow down.  As I look out of the helicopter view, I'm seeing a lot of diamonds and rubies on the highway.  I did that once.  They wanted to make me a helicopter reporter.  Whoa.  And we did a little, it was like a prop plane.  I mean, it was small.  And I went up there.  And after a while, that thing just shakes like anything.  Yeah.  And I threw up.  You threw up in the airplane?  They said, all right, come on in, Dennis.  And then the pilot gets on, you guy threw up. 
[03:08:00]  You guy threw up.  That's an old school pilot.  And you have to sit there with the mess on you until back to the airport.  Oh, boy.  Danny.  Yeah, that's terrible.  Danny.  Danny.  Yeah.  You don't want to talk about that here on The Breakfast Hour.  No.  See, people are eating right now.  You want to keep it light.  Nice.  Especially when they're taking tequila shots with their breakfast.  Is there something called The Breakfast Hour?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Five to nine.  They're not a clock, then they get into the office.  Who's the guy sitting outside there?  Is that the guy that wants to have a shot?  That's Dave LaGreca from the NFL channel. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  He wants to have a shot.  He wants to have a shot.  Iraq, get on in here.  Iraq.  Tequila Friday.  Tequila Donuts Friday.  I am out of here.  Yeah.  There he is.  How you doing, man?  What's up, boys?  What's up, brother?  What's happening?  Dennis is going out.  He's back to the music stations.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Pleasure to meet you in front of me in your studio.  Yeah, right?  Please.  Dave LaGreca hosts the wrestling show here on Sirius.  Oh, very cool, man.  He has a really lousy co-host, but he's good.  Who's the co-host?  I don't know.  What's his name? 
[03:09:00]  Doug Mortman.  He's not crazy.  He's very good.  Have you been talking about Fandango?  Fandango.  You've got to do it right, or he's not going to wrestle.  I'm trying, or he doesn't wrestle.  You've got to let the A's breathe in.  We're in the twilight zone today.  Fandango.  He tweeted me.  He tweeted you.  Yes, he did.  That's fucking pretty.  I'm all in with the Fandango.  You're not saying it right.  So where's the tequila?  Ah, yeah.  Right there.  Iraq, come on up here. 
[03:09:30]  What are you doing?  You're not a good host.  You'll even open bottles of tequila in front of Rich Voss.  That's wonderful.  I'd even, it didn't faze me.  If it was crack, then it'd be another story.  Okay.  Why don't you have crack Friday?  I had another one, baby.  Iraq's poured another one for himself.  Iraq.  You're going to have to alter your list, of course.  This will be Iraq's sixth shot of tequila.  Iraq is on number six.  So what donut goes with tequila?  It's really up to you.  We're running out of choices there.  I think something chocolatey is good.  No, he doesn't like sweets. 
[03:10:00]  Or the apple filled even is kind of nice with the tequila.  So do you eat the donut first?  How do you do it?  Do you take a bite and then Iraq?  I think what you do is you first take the sugar donut.  You lick the sugar.  You do the shot of tequila and you bite into the donut.  Okay, hold on.  Let me try this.  Yeah, yeah.  Lick the sugar.  There you go.  Now the shot of tequila.  Now you bite the donut.  There it is.  Not bad.  It works that way.  That was good, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, you know, screw it.  Who needs lime and salt? 
[03:10:30]  Now let me try it.  Fandango.  That works.  That works.  We'd be watching him wrestle right now.  That's right.  If he heard you say that.  And what are you doing right now for the NFL channel?  Producing.  Just producing?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  The show goes on.  There's a good producer on him.  They could just leave the studio.  Yeah.  Eat donuts and drink tequila.  I don't know how this happened, but E-Rock came up with a slam dunk idea today.  Speaking of slam dunk, it's going to be one more for the sex man right now. 
[03:11:00]  E-Rock.  Huh?  This will be your sixth.  Making a nice even six.  How you feeling, E-Rock?  Nice round number.  How you feeling?  I'm feeling toasty.  Were you in the bathroom before?  No, I was in there running the commercials and bringing us back on break.  No, it sucks.  When was the last time you went to the bathroom?  Were you there?  When you were looking for me.  Oh, okay.  Because I heard somebody splash water on their face and go, oh.  Oh, really?  In the bathroom.  I thought it was you.  Oh, okay.  You're bosses.  Yeah.  You know what sucks?  What?  Sam's going to get the drunk E-Rock and Ron E-Fez is going to get the drunk E-Rock. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking forward to that after show today.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Because right when it kicks in, we're out of here.  Yeah.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  E-Rock, there he goes.  Another shot.  Gulp it down.  He's looking a little.  There it goes.  And it's down.  I just got goosebumps just watching that.  All right, Big Dave.  Anything else you want to say, Big Dave?  That's it.  I appreciate it.  Big Dave.  That's the first time I've been called Big Dave. 
[03:12:00]  My ex-wife never called me Big Dave.  Oh, hey.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Thank you for the tequila and the sugar donut.  I appreciate it.  Not in the breakfast hour.  Don't be talking about that.  A little too blue.  A little too blue.  That talk is a little too blue.  What's the ramp time on this one?  I still have some ramp time left there.  Double time checks.  Double time checks.  But listen to Busted Open.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not 82XM2A.  Thanks for that.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.  Were you one of the gentlemen that actually went to the Super Bowl this year?  Yes.  Son of a bitch!  That makes it.  It goes well.  Great. 
[03:12:30]  Wonderful.  Of course it does.  Of course it does.  LT.  Nice.  Take it easy, sir.  All right, Big Dave.  Very nice.  LaGreca.  This is going so much better than I thought it would.  Absolutely.  It's awesome.  It's awesome.  I thought this was going to be a total bomb.  Just E-Rock doing shots alone.  But other people.  Who's coming in next?  The Cosmo Brun.  It's almost 9 o'clock.  Taylor from Cosmo.  Should we hear about 9 o'clock?  Oh.  All right.  So a young lady.  Should we break so that we can get a clear the field for Taylor?  Clear the field for her?  Clear the field, even us up with the time, and we still haven't played the audio that 
[03:13:00]  we meant to play at 10 to 7.  Oh, E-Rock's audio.  Right, right, right.  Holy shit.  It's an E-Rock day today.  I can't believe it's 9 o'clock, because I know we have done nothing.  This is what happened.  But I love...  Time travel?  Give the show to E-Rock.  Yeah.  I love Danny, because radio is a craft for those guys.  Dude, he is amazing.  What did he call the time check?  Double time check.  Double time check.  Double time check.  Double time check. 
[03:13:30]  8.40, 20 to 9.  And I love when he...  If he does error, he's got a way to recover from it.  It's not just, oh, shit, I made a mistake.  It's just like, oh, yeah.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning all.  And it's smooth, too.  Everything's smooth.  He was doing radio when there was only, like, four stations, right?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  Back in the day.  He doesn't look that old, though.  No, he's not that old.  But he...  There's still guys like that out there.  Yeah.  E-Rock's feeling it, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, buddy.  Are you feeling it now?  Yeah, buddy.  It's there. 
[03:14:00]  He's got a host.  It's getting too hot to wear your hat.  At least...  Oh, too hot for the hat.  Too hot for the hat.  Yeah.  Should we get Taylor in here, or she needs a few minutes?  Why don't we take a break?  I'll check on Taylor.  All right.  Why don't we do that?  The worst is yet to come.  This is O&A's Worst of 2013.  2013.  On the O.P. and Anthony channel.  This is O.P. and Anthony's Worst of 2013. 
[03:14:30]  Worst of 2013.  Fucked up show today.  We got Rich Voss in studio.  We're doing Irish music today, and we're also doing tequila and donuts.  I don't know.  Let's go to the scoreboard, Sam.  Okay.  Right now, with the no thanks, is Nicole, Stan, probably the out cue guys, and the rest of the O&A show.  Right.  The takers have been Big Dave LaGreca from NFL Radio, One Shot. 
[03:15:00]  Rich Davis from the mashup.  One shot.  Stinky.  Stinky!  One shot.  The road dog, Roland.  One shot.  One shot.  That's surprising.  Third place is up for grabs right now.  Oh, yeah.  Just one of those guys has to step up, and they get the bronze today.  Or somebody walks in here and does a couple of shots, automatically third place.  Good fucking points, Sam Roberts.  Denny, however, is solid in second with three shots.  He's working on his ramp time, as we speak.  Ramp time?  He realizes he's a little rusty.  He's working on the ramp time. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  And he was unhappy with his double time check a minute ago.  He was.  He was a little unhappy with that.  A little unhappy with that.  But solid.  Number one first place with a bullet at six shots.  Oh, man.  Is the creator of Tequila and Donut Day, the sex man, Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  Eric, to you.  How you feeling, buddy?  How you feeling?  I can feel my teeth.  Shooter Nagel.  Nice.  You can feel his teeth, ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:16:00]  And we're playing Dropkick Murphy's Kiss Me, I'm Shit-Faced.  Oh, my God.  That's for you, I guess.  No tequilas being drunk.  Or drank.  No.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock, you tapping out at six shots?  No, but it's nice to have somebody else to do it with.  Well, what happened to Taylor from the Cosmo channel?  Yeah, where's the Cosmo channel?  Yeah, what's going on?  Tell her we can't wait around all day.  Taylor. 
[03:16:30]  We might have to bring Denny back.  Denny, if you're listening, come on back.  Denny, what's he doing over there?  Ramp time?  He's practicing his, yeah.  I see Rolando down there, too.  Rolando has been avoiding the tequila for the most part.  Yeah.  Who else is this?  I don't know.  And we also have the E-Rock audio.  Imagine how much trouble we'd get if we forced the interns to drink.  Holy shit.  And then we'd kick them all in the balls.  Wow.  That would be stupid.  With our mouths. 
[03:17:00]  Ah, with our mouths.  Ah, shit.  Shit.  That's the kid we're trading for right there.  Right there.  Oh, that's the kid, yeah.  We're trading for him.  Sal goes.  We get him.  Yes.  And we'll add a fucking mongoloid to be named later.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Denny's coming back down the hall.  Oh, here he comes.  It is after 9 o'clock.  Can't we get some of the other people around here to do it?  Well, it's up to you.  You start tequila and donut day.  I think, you know, Roland should come back.  Maybe Sal.  It's after 9. 
[03:17:30]  It seems acceptable.  Denny's coming back in.  Denny's like the star of the show today.  Yeah.  You like Denny Rich Voss?  Yeah, I like that.  He makes me calm.  He makes me feel calm.  Denny, you want a shot of tequila in the coffee?  I don't like to come in when you've got the on-air light on, though.  He's so technical and professional.  You're so professional.  That's it.  Why?  Well, I mean, that's where I was brought up in this business.  Yeah.  When did you start?  In 1986.  Oh, 1986.  I was doing a job.  I was working at WGBB 1240, the Pulse of Long Island. 
[03:18:00]  I remember it.  I hosted a show at Hofstra University with Jay Black and the Americans, and the opening  act was Jerry Seinfeld.  Wow.  And the funny thing is, Jerry Seinfeld's dad used to own a sign shop on Long Island called  Cal Signs.  Signs?  Cal Signs.  Oh, that doesn't make sense.  That was Cal Seinfeld.  And sometimes in the TV show, you'll see shots of him walking down the street, and you'll  see a show up there, a little sign up there.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Did not notice that.  And I brought Jerry on stage.  Fascinating. 
[03:18:30]  You did?  Yeah, I did.  How'd you do that?  Let us go back.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  If you would, take us back to that moment.  And what is your radio name officially?  I used Dennis Falcone.  I used to use Big Joe.  You know who you used to use?  Chuck Root.  Big Joe on the go.  Well, because, you see, I worked at a station.  I worked at a station.  There were two guys named Dennis.  Uh-huh.  Can't have that.  And one guy was named Dick.  So I said, well, you can't have two dicks at a radio station.  It's a little blue.  It's a little blue.  A little blue.  A little blue for you, Danny.  So they said, what's your middle name? 
[03:19:00]  So I said, you know, Joseph.  So I used Big Joe.  So I was Big Joe on the go.  Big Joe on the go.  On 1240 Radio.  Radio.  You kind of, you know, rhyme everything there.  It did rhyme.  Oh, so how'd you bring Cypher on stage?  Yeah, so bring us back to that time.  Do you need music to do it?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I know you're here tonight to see Jay Black and the Americans  with all those great hits from the 60s.  We've got some people from the 60s.  Come on, let me hear you out there.  Hey, 60s.  Hey, 60s.  Thank you.  What did he say?  I can't hear him very well.  We've got a guy.  Maybe you've seen him at the Richard M. Dixon White House.  And I can't get up. 
[03:19:30]  Maybe you've seen him on the Johnny Carson Tonight Show.  He's from right here in the neighborhood.  Anybody from Massapequa?  Come on, everybody.  Put your hands together for Massapequa.  Massapequa.  In the house.  Well, I'm going to bring a guy out.  He's from your backyard.  Maybe you know him.  Maybe you've seen him in ShopRite.  Ladies and gentlemen, come on.  Put your hands together for Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, wait a second, Jerry.  Hold on.  Come on.  It's a Saturday night.  It's a Saturday night, and I need some energy.  Show this guy some love.  Let me get a nice WGBB welcome. 
[03:20:00]  One more time, I'll give it to you again.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me hear Jerry Seinfeld.  Come on now.  I just want to come out and do my hand.  What's the matter with me?  There's nothing worse than a long autobiography.  I took five minutes when Jerry sat there.  Because all the guys at Hofstra reunion guys are going,  we've got to get out of here at 11.  I mean, he's fantastic.  This guy is fantastic.  Rich Boss, the boss.  Very good, Danny.  Rich Boss, the boss.  Have you heard of me before today? 
[03:20:30]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, good.  And what do you think of him?  I think he's a funny guy.  Thank you.  Funny guy.  I love his voice.  Yeah.  Well, if you ever need me to bring you on stage.  He'll bring you up.  In case I don't want to do my act.  The boss, Rich Boss.  I'm just working doing communion season.  What's that?  Oh, you're working during communion.  That's one of the biggest seasons for me.  It's a big season for comics.  I do a lot of private house parties for communion.  That's good.  I love house parties.  Make sure you show your Jew tattoos at the communion parties.  I come out with a star, David.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Because when I open up a house party, I go, we're going all night.  We're going all night.  No overtime here, baby.  We're going to rock this party all night long.  I fucking swear.  I'm going to be having a party at my house.  You've got to bring daddy.  Probably a Memorial Day party.  Some early June kind of party to usher in the summer at my house.  Well, let me know, because dates are filling up soon.  You're going to have to book him soon.  I want him spinning.  Maybe an opening of the pool.  Let me tell you, I'm going to arrange this. 
[03:21:30]  I'm going to get a party put together, and I want you there to DJ it.  That would be great.  I think it would be fantastic.  He will fucking, you know.  I might put you on the website then and get a little picture of you.  He's fucking classic.  Holy shit.  And if you and your fiancé decide to take that next step, let's talk about personalizing  your wedding.  Yeah, and you can do a communion at the same time.  Fiancé?  I don't believe this young man's married yet.  I had a fiancé once. 
[03:22:00]  She turned into a wife, and then turned into some fucking mythical creature from hell.  Well, there's this great dish jockey, an oldies dish jockey out of Pittsburgh, Porky  Chedwick.  He said, don't get married.  They won't let you hang around the radio station.  Yeah, Porky.  What a crazy guy.  Porky Chedwick.  Whatever happened to Porky?  You know, sometimes, like I say.  You hear a band?  They came through the Philly area.  Three Jacks and a Jill.  They're fantastic.  Yeah, that Master Jack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a string.  Whatever happened to Porky?  I need to know what happened to Porky.  What happened to Porky? 
[03:22:30]  Porky's still alive, but he's still doing it in Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  He's a 3WS, I believe.  Tearing up Pittsburgh.  No idea.  Sam, is it tequila time?  Nobody's drinking.  I thought this was a party.  Well, it's E-Rock's party.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Why don't you step up to the bar?  Belly up to the bar.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  There's a lady in the room.  Yes, I see.  We're seeing a lady in the room.  Hi.  Why don't you introduce yourself?  Hi.  I'm Taylor.  Taylor.  I'm from Cosmo Radio.  Cosmo Radio.  I love the voice.  What do you do over there?  I love Taylor's voice.  That is a great Demi Moore kind of voice. 
[03:23:00]  Kind of got a Demi Moore thing happening.  Yeah.  This is my real voice.  This is my pretending to be Demi Moore voice.  It is good.  It's raspy.  Yeah.  Thank you.  It's sexy, smoky.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How did you get that?  How did you get that voice?  By smoking and taking shots.  Smoking?  Yeah.  And doing shots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you always like a party girl?  No, no, no.  This is actually, my mom sounds just like me.  If you put us in a room together and close your eyes, you cannot differ.  Is your mom Brenda Vaccaro?  Yes.  Hey, I'm Brenda Vaccaro. 
[03:23:30]  Tell her who's on where we're on, on Cosmo Radio.  Yes.  We are competitors.  Oh, we're all one big happy family.  We're probably here.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  We're probably going for different demos.  Yeah.  As long as they subscribe.  I don't know.  Who knows at this point.  I thought we were going for the exact same demographic.  Yeah.  Who knows?  No.  As long as they're subscribing, it doesn't matter what they listen to.  That's the kid we're trading for.  We're getting rid of Sal.  We're getting this kid in a big trade.  What's his name?  What's his name, Sam?  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the microphone.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes. 
[03:24:00]  Yes.  His fucking eyes.  I'm torn between him and her.  You're falling in love with his eyes.  I'm telling you, she didn't have the ring, okay?  But he's, fuck, he's 10.  Damn.  How old are you?  24.  24.  Handsome Johnny Tubestake runs this fucking place on the weekends.  I've seen him work, and I want to trade Sal for him.  Is that it?  You don't mind, right, Sal?  No, I want to stay here.  Yeah, but he's in here doing a shot of tequila.  I don't see you fucking stepping up to the plate.  No, no, no.  I don't want to drink during the show. 
[03:24:30]  Thus then, why the trade?  Which will go down.  I don't know if I can do seven, though.  I can do one.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's one more than Sal.  Wait, how many are we doing?  As many as you want, Tyler.  No, no, no.  Me?  E-Rock's done six.  Oh, it's a competition?  Nah.  Well, not really.  It's a lot.  We have a friendly competition going on, but no one's going to beat E-Rock at this point.  You can do two for bronze.  Yeah, if you do two, you're going to be in the third place category, beating out a lot  of guys.  I don't know if that's a great idea.  You're not the pilot. 
[03:25:00]  Where are you going?  Oh, I am actually the pilot.  No, you're not a pilot.  I'm not the pilot.  See?  Wait, why are you going to LA?  We're flying it up to 35,000 feet.  Why are you going to LA?  The smoking light is on in the cockpit.  My husband is running a marathon.  Husband.  Husband.  Get out.  Get out.  I know.  A marathon?  A marathon.  In California?  Well, he was going to run to New York, and then they canceled that, so it was like, you 
[03:25:30]  know.  So a lot of these people had to find another marathon.  Yep.  Yeah, so these other marathons are doing very well.  No one gives a fuck.  Why am I explaining this?  How long have you been married?  No one cares, but it is the truth.  A lot of people had to find another marathon.  How long have you been married there?  Two and a half years.  How's it going for you?  Is it better than fucking...  It's so annoying.  What about fucking down the hall?  You know how that marriage is.  You?  No.  Oh, call me?  Nicole.  Oh, I mean, we're best friends, so...  But you know how her marriage is, right?  Yeah, as bad as mine.  Called in the proverbial sheer.  When she goes and says, as bad as mine, what's the problem? 
[03:26:00]  What's your biggest complaint since you've been married?  I just...  You know what?  I get very annoyed by people very easily.  What happened?  So he just annoyed me.  Johnny's got to do his shot.  He's got to go to a meeting.  What?  What meeting have you got?  He's got to go to a meeting.  He's got to do a shot?  Yeah.  He's got to do your shot.  He's one of the guys running the South by Southwest stuff.  Wow.  Really?  24-7.  Non-stop.  Sal's got a...  Sal's pouting, by the way.  Oh, Iraq's pissed.  Iraq got all drunky, man.  Like, you're not even toasting me, you bitch.  Oh, we're doing this now?  Yeah.  Do it up. 
[03:26:30]  It's warm.  Couldn't we chill this, please?  You'll be chilling after you do the shot.  He's not easy to be married to, either.  Oh, it's warm.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Good one.  All right.  Thank you, handsome Johnny Tube Steaks.  I hated that.  Now, why is Sal pouting, by the way?  I'm not pouting.  At all.  No one likes it.  Because Sal's a worthless piece of shit.  Eric, you said no one likes me.  Why don't you go home and fuck your wife tonight?  I'm not getting crazy.  I'm getting drunk on the air.  Jesus Christ.  Oh!  What kind of slam is that?  Why don't you go fuck your wife?  What the fuck is that? 
[03:27:00]  Why don't you go fuck your wife?  I guess I will.  I think I will.  I think I will.  Are you going to take that?  Are you going to take that, Iraq?  I think he's implying that you get drunk and pass out instead of fucking your wife.  Oh!  That's the one I took away from now.  Is that what that bash was, Sal?  Well, he said he was going to go home and watch movies.  You look really drunk, by the way.  Tell her.  He is.  You're like glassy-eyed central.  Isn't he so glassy-eyed?  It's so awesome.  He's bedroom eyes, too. 
[03:27:30]  He's got seven shots of the kill in him.  He's like, yeah, baby.  In two hours, by the way.  Two hours, he did seven shots.  That's pretty impressive.  Oh, my God.  So your question is, is Taylor going to do one more so she can get second place?  Third place.  You should have third place.  There's a tie.  You'll sleep better on the plane.  Yeah, you sleep on the plane.  I feel like I'm going to throw up just after that one shot.  There's four people tied with one shot each.  And we never found out what's wrong with her marriage.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the biggest annoyance with her being married?  I have the problem with the marriage.  He's wonderful and amazing, and I'm just like a bitch.  Really? 
[03:28:00]  Are you a bitch?  Yeah, total bitch.  Why are you a bitch?  What do you do?  That's my best friend.  Give us a good bitchy example of what you would do to him to be considered a bitch.  Oh, my God.  Wake up.  There's so many.  So many.  Yeah.  Okay, like this one time, he didn't make a dinner reservation for a Friday night, so  I started flipping my shit because I was like, why wouldn't I just moved in with him?  And my mom said to me, if you move in with the guy, he's going to get complacent and lazy.  He's not going to post you.  So, I mean, obviously, that ended up happening.  Man, that is some rock you got there on that finger.  Well, on that finger. 
[03:28:30]  Sure.  So, we went out to, so he, I moved in with him, and then that was the first night that  he didn't make a dinner reservation for a Friday night.  So, I was like, he already got complacent.  So, you're thinking mom's right.  Totally.  So, we went out, so I bitched at him, and then we went out for dinner, but I was like,  no decent place.  You can't go to a decent place with a day of reservation.  So, we went there, and I started yelling at the waitress because the wine sucked.  I said it tastes like, what was it?  I said it tastes like the blood of Christ.  It was like church wine.  It was horrible.  You should have actually made a reservation at Dorsey.  It's wonderful.  Very hard to get into. 
[03:29:00]  Amen.  In beautiful business cards.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Best movie ever.  Oh, man.  So, we got in a fight because he took me out to dinner.  What a bitch, right?  That is fucking, I'd be so pissed.  Like, I'm fucking taking out to dinner.  You bitching at me?  Yeah.  Yep.  And I'd say, keep your fucking mother out of our shit.  Don't let her fucking influence what I'm doing.  She don't know me.  If she wants to come over here and suck my dick, then she can comment on what a fucking  asshole I am.  Wow.  Wow.  You got to lay these bitches out straight.  Just talk about mom to suck a dick. 
[03:29:30]  Hey, you know what?  I don't know.  Then she'll probably shut the fuck up next time.  And she didn't do anything.  She was the one that put the bug in your ear about him being complacent.  No, she just put a general bug in my ear, not a specific bug.  General bug.  General bug.  All right.  Are you guys going to survive or what?  We're going to make it.  You're going to make it.  We're in the long haul.  I love him.  We're going to make it.  Is he attentive to you?  Let's say, attentive to all your needs?  He's a Jewish guy, so of course.  Wait, wait.  I don't mean financially.  I mean in the sack.  Rich is a Jewish guy.  I mean it in a good way. 
[03:30:00]  Jewish men make the best husbands.  Are you crazy?  But is he attentive?  Does he go down on you and stuff?  Oh, like that?  Oh, we're not doing that.  Does he?  Look, look.  Nothing?  No, not.  We're not doing that.  No, no, no, no.  You and I.  We're not doing that.  I understand.  That's why I said, I didn't, I had to say, because you weren't understanding me for a  second.  Is he, let's just say, is he attentive in every way that you need him to be?  Yes.  Whatever I need, he provides.  All right.  That's all I'm going to say.  Except reservations.  No, he got it.  He learned a lesson.  He didn't get the reservation. 
[03:30:30]  He never did that ever again.  Oh, look at her.  She never, he never.  Are you Jewish?  Are you Irish?  No, but I act like I am.  Are you Irish?  No, I'm, I'm, what am I?  I'm German and French.  That's a good combination.  You lost the war twice.  Yeah, she fucking takes over.  Why do you think I'm drinking with you guys at 9.30 in the morning?  Uh-huh.  I do have to go back, though.  I have to.  All right, Taylor.  All right.  Cosmo Radio.  Taylor from Cosmo Radio.  Is she doing the one more before she goes?  It's up to her. 
[03:31:00]  I've seen her, and I like that she actually spoke up and let everybody know her Jewish  husband licks her box.  She might go for the second shot.  The really nice thing is if she does one more, Iraq says he'll do one more.  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  Wait, Iraq's just tapping out.  No, I'm not tapping out.  We're running low, but I just was told Heather B will be here in about 10 minutes.  Can I, can she take half of mine?  Can I do a half of mine?  Oh, you gotta do it.  Don't be a lightweight.  Oh, come on.  Lightweight, how many have you had?  It's way too many.  We lost, we lost count. 
[03:31:30]  So we're not gonna get the bronze?  No, I'm purely exhibitionist.  Yeah, we're not allowed to win any awards because we host a show.  If I throw up, will you guys still like me?  Yeah.  We like you more.  I fucking love you if you throw up.  I like a good chick that throws up.  Cheers.  No, give me your cup.  E-Rock.  No, we're running low.  I'm saving it.  But you have some.  No, I already did my shot.  Where's the coffee?  I don't like the coffee.  You guys, I have to go.  I gotta go.  We have other people coming in about 10 minutes, so I want to save it. 
[03:32:00]  Heather's gonna have the coffee.  No, E-Rock, you can't fucking stop.  Yeah, you gotta do it with me.  That's so bad.  You gotta do some.  Do the shot.  You gotta.  We'll figure it out, but you gotta.  If we gotta bring the Clooney tequila in, you gotta do that.  I'll do the Clooney.  I hate the coffee.  Well, then do that.  There you go.  Okay.  Yeah, there's plenty in there.  No, if it's tequila.  Wow, that's a big shot there, E-Rock.  Wow, E-Rock.  All right.  Cheers.  Taylor is now going into second place, or third place, with two shots. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, that one hurt.  Wow.  That one left its mark.  That one hurt.  That left its mark.  No, I'm just kidding.  Wow.  Damn.  Okay, thanks, boys.  All right, Taylor.  Mazel tov, mazel tov, Taylor.  Mazel, mazel, thank you.  Mazel.  Don't be a stranger.  Taylor from Cosmo Radio.  There she goes.  What's she wearing there?  What do you got on?  She looks good.  A little black thing, a little wrapper.  She looks very good.  She's got a nice ass on her.  She's wearing, like, hammer pants.  All right.  You're all right, then.  You got a pretty sexy body on you.  Oh, me?  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  You're going to like that.  Look at that.  She's got a nice breast.  Look at nice ass on her.  He's looking ample.  Rich Vosky would be at McGuire's.  Wait, what happened?  Oh, shit.  E-Rock, what happened?  The secretary, the front desk lady.  She wants a donut.  She wants a donut.  Well, you can't have a donut without the tequila on Tequila Donut Day.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, that's part of the rules.  Yeah.  Cool.  It's kind of sexy, huh? 
[03:33:30]  It was something about her.  The voice.  Yeah, yeah.  The voice thing.  The attitude.  She's in third place, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Two shots for Tay-Tay.  Danny's in second with three shots.  And E-Rock's up to eight.  Eight?  Eight, because he did two just now.  Did he really?  And let's put Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks on the list there.  Yep, put him on the board.  One more than Sal.  By the way, Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks has been talking for the last time.  Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks.  It's a fucking casino.  Well, he's got the eyes.  Rich Vos pointed out the eyes.  He's got the eyes. 
[03:34:00]  Is that what it is?  It's sparkling blue eyes?  The kid was a ten.  The kid's going to go places.  You think he's got a future in the business?  Don't let Danny see me slouching, by the way, as I broadcast.  No, he wouldn't like that.  He wouldn't like that at all.  You have to sit up straight when you broadcast.  You guys don't stand up.  Slouching and slurring.  You're dying for it.  Slouching and slurring is the name of this show.  Johnny's been talking for the last two days.  About the big trade?  About the fact that Opie wants him here really bad.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's he been saying? 
[03:34:30]  He's just been excited that, one, that he's been talked about, and two, he'll take Sal's  place in a moment.  And a moan.  And a moan.  And a moan.  You are really having a hard time holding together this fucking speaking.  This is what I want to aspire to, is Eric fucking sloppily talking on the radio.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Oh, shit.  I've been providing content for three fucking hours.  What?  By just drinking and making yourself seem super pathetic.  And guess what?  The hosts don't like you.  And by the way, Sal is sitting there being like, I'm not going to provide content by 
[03:35:00]  just drinking tequila.  If you guys want me to put on a thong and bronzer up my body, I'll do it.  Oh, wow.  Sal.  So, Sam, you fucking nailed him.  You did do that.  I think Sal's being a party pooper.  He is.  Why are you being a party pooper, Sal?  What's going through your mind?  What do you want me to do?  What do you think could be saved if you come in and take a shot?  Yeah, what's going through your mind?  I don't, I'm sorry.  I would do it gladly after the show, but not right now.  After the show?  Is this a professional decision? 
[03:35:30]  No, it's not professional.  No, it's just, I just think it's kind of pathetic here watching Eric get fucking drunk at fucking  7 in the morning.  But it's tequila and donut Friday.  And by the way, listen to this list.  Yeah, it's not, if this was a regular fucking Tuesday, then it would be a little weird.  Two for Tuesday.  Right, but this was a package E-Roc put together.  Listen to this list.  A bit.  He put a bit together for the show.  A bit.  The Sex Man, Denny, Tay-Tay, Road Dog, Stinky, Rich Davis, Big Dave LaGreca, Handsome Johnny  Tube Stakes.  Those are the primetime players of Sirius XM. 
[03:36:00]  Not one pathetic name.  No, exactly.  And those are the people taking shots.  That's the cool table.  You know what?  That's the cool table.  That's the back of the bus.  That's the back of the bus.  Back of the fucking bus.  We got eight guys that have done the tequila.  This is, you watch Mad Men, this was every day for them.  Every day.  Every day.  And cigarettes, by the way.  Every day.  We're not even talking cigarettes.  Every fucking day.  And Sal's over.  I just think it's really pathetic that these guys are subjective.  I didn't say them, I said Eric, because Eric's getting fucking hammered.  And he's the fucking man.  You know what?  I'll do something better.  I'll show you the pictures of the guy that I took this morning on the train. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, that's right.  I didn't take that.  Anthony?  Yeah?  Let me throw myself under the bus.  Oh.  All right.  Do it, do it.  Get the jack to lift the bus up.  It's the nine years that I've been on this show.  Nine?  Nine years.  Nine years?  Nine years.  Nine years.  Holy fuck, really?  Nine years that I've been on this show.  Yeah.  Not only have I provided good content for this program.  Can you name some of the bits?  Because I don't remember, really. 
[03:37:00]  He's telling himself.  I almost died from the City of Challenge.  I know.  I love his arm gestures here.  I'm in Frankie Blue Eyes, Eric.  Frankie Blue Eyes.  We have the Frankie Blue Eyes.  Frankie Blue Eyes.  And we got to fuck that listener.  Oh, God.  Wait, name some of the bits that you almost died.  Not only have I almost died for this show.  For this show.  For this show.  Am I the only one who's seeing this?  No one cares about you.  Turn your mic off.  Not only have I not almost died for this show.  Not almost died. 
[03:37:30]  Not almost died, right?  Of course.  I've taken body scarring with hot wax shots.  Which we're going to redo for the elevator show.  Can we do it today?  It won't hurt as much.  In the same bit, I bashed my head into the toilet mechanism at the K-Rock bathroom.  Toilet mechanism.  It's fucking Jack Black and campaign.  Okay.  He is campaigning for himself right now.  I've taken grapefruit shots to the eye.  Oh, I forgot about grapefruit shots to the eye.  That was good.  Can we do that in the elevator?  Yeah, but who cares about that? 
[03:38:00]  That's weak.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Now he's producing my elevator show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Son of a bitch.  I've danced in my underpants where Steve C. has put dollars in my pants when we got  the new stripper pole.  Yes.  Keep going.  I've danced in my underpants singing the Nannerpuss song.  I remember the Nannerpuss song.  In my underpants, he said.  Someone's mentioning liquid ass breath spray.  You had liquid?  I don't think that was me.  There was liquid ass sprayed on you, wasn't there? 
[03:38:30]  I think that was me.  We did that more with David.  All right, then I'm going to.  I'll bounce that first.  Intern David was a liquid ass guy.  You know what?  I don't know, but I don't remember that one.  Did you say the cinnamon challenge?  Yeah, I said I almost died.  I know, but you didn't say what.  Almost arrested at the Tony Danza show.  Well, that's the next thing I was going to get to.  Oh, keep going.  I got assaulted and almost arrested at the Tony Danza show.  Pepper!  Pepper Hicks!  Fucking Pepper Hicks.  Fucking some drunk asshole just texted me saying that there's free fucking liquor in here.  That's yes.  By the way, that's Pepper Hicks?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm Pepper Hicks.  I had no idea who you were. 
[03:39:00]  Pepper fucking rules.  What's he from?  We're going to trade for you too, Pepper.  Whatever.  Just fucking give me the fucking tequila.  Give him the coffee.  All right.  Pepper is getting some coffee tequila.  Cafe tequila.  Can I smell the coffee tequila?  Top off yours.  Come on.  Wait, hang on.  Pussy.  What?  Oh, fuck.  Pepper's in.  He's all in.  Oh, God.  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  What?  He's banging into my chair like a fucking drunk.  Shit, does that smell good?  It does it?  Yes, it really does. 
[03:39:30]  Let me smell.  It really smells all right.  It's very coffee-like.  You're not a coffee guy.  It's very coffee-ish.  Yes.  Pepper just slammed it waiting for E-Rock.  You want another one, Pepper?  You want another one?  Let's do it.  Oh!  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  Pepper, you're going to tie for third place.  Pepper is going to keep going.  Hold on, hold on.  Pepper isn't way around.  Wow.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, it just spills.  Oh, no.  E-Rock just finished the mess.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Officially, how many shots is that?  That's two. 
[03:40:00]  At least.  That's two more.  Would you say this is just...  I haven't done two in a second.  No, I think in that glass, there's two shots.  Oh, boy.  Would you say that's fair?  All right, that's fair.  Okay.  Okay.  Write them up.  Here they go.  Cheers.  The salute.  There goes Peppy Hamburger.  Oh, God.  And fucking E-Rock just slammed it down.  Oh, shit.  How you feeling, E-Rock?  It's ten shots of tequila.  You can tell pepper spray is going to go forever, man.  Well, I have to do a show prep for the Ron and Fez show.  Ah, Ronny won't mind. 
[03:40:30]  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Wait, if you do one more, though, you got third place by yourself.  You know that.  All right, then let's go for it.  Oh, shit.  You get the bronze.  I don't think anyone's going to get the bronze.  You see how much he just poured?  He just poured a lot of it.  You don't give a fuck.  Man, pepper is the real deal.  That's good.  That's a double shot.  Chase it down with a little Coke, and you are good.  Come a donut?  Come a donut?  Yeah.  Pepper, I like you on the air, by the way, Ronnie.  Thank you, guys.  You do a very good job.  Absolutely.  Pepper, you fucking drunk fuck.  Fine, Fez, 11 a.m. to 3.  All right. 
[03:41:00]  All right.  Take it easy.  Pepper just took second place.  Pepper.  Oh, second?  Yeah, that's a double shot he did just now.  Pepper Hicks just took.  Well, let's get Danny to see if he has something to say about that.  I love Pepper.  Let me go grab Danny.  Oh, so continue, Iraq.  Pepper's the best.  Tony Danza.  Right, Tony Danza.  I think this is a big-time face to Sal, who now has his arms crossed as he continues  to pout.  Tony Danza, I did the Hawk thing on Fox, live, running around, flapping my arms like  an asshole.  And that was his first fucking nickname.  Yeah, yeah, Hawk.  We tried it for the Hawk, but it didn't stick.  Mayo Challenge. 
[03:41:30]  Yes.  Oh, Mayo Challenge.  Was that the one where your eyes turned red?  Yeah, that was bad.  You broke blood vessels in your eyes as he was puking.  Three-fourths of the jar.  Yeah, yeah.  Eating.  Peanut Butter Hat.  Peanut Butter Hat.  Fluff and Utter Hat.  A lot of people remember this.  Fluff Hat.  Fluff and Utter Hat.  Chubby Bunny.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I forgot about that one.  What better way to close it out with.  I did Dance Friday on Channel 11.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, how you doing?  We're on a fucking lot for this show.  Right.  For this show.  And let me tell you.  Oh, wow. 
[03:42:00]  Is he fucking...  You're doing all right, E-Rock.  So what is...  He just touched my shoe.  I have my...  I'm kind of a Friday casual kickback on my feet up on the console.  Make sure Danny's okay with that.  E-Rock just grabbed the toe of my shoe and shook it.  Like, ha-ha.  How you doing, man?  This is the producer of the hottest show on Sundays, the Sam Roberts show, 4 p.m. Eastern  on this channel.  Wow.  It's Jackson Bull.  Jackson Bull.  That's me.  Jackson Bull in the house.  Holy fuck. 
[03:42:30]  In person.  I've heard you.  And, uh...  Oh, E-Rock.  You gotta go get the, um...  We got shots here?  Let me go get the other one.  Get some Clooney vodka from, uh...  Holy shit.  ...Roland.  Uh...  I just came from a bachelor party, too.  What?  Just?  Oh, two days ago.  Wait.  You just came from one two days ago?  He already sounds drunk.  Wednesday.  What old budget bachelor party was that?  It was the worst bus ride I've ever taken in my life.  I'm not really understanding.  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  I just felt like...  Shit.  ...a zombie. 
[03:43:00]  And you had to get on a bus for the trip back to New York?  Yeah.  Were you puking?  Dry heat?  It's terrible.  From where?  From AC.  Which, if you've ever been there, it's...  No, no, we've never been there.  No, we've never been there.  How is it?  It's a magical city.  If you're anywhere in between the casinos or resorts, it's a wasteland.  Yes, it really is.  It's Thunderdome.  It's terrible.  Yeah, yeah.  Why were you in between?  Uh, because I had to get there.  I took a bus ride.  Oh, the bus.  It goes through the streets like that?  Yeah.  You should just stay on the highway, though. 
[03:43:30]  Right?  Until you get to the boardwalk.  You think?  It's crazy.  I wouldn't do that.  Unless I'm armed.  Right.  So what?  Um, we're waiting for E-Rock to come back with the George Clooney tequila.  Because E-Rock apparently drank all the Patron.  Sex Man is up to ten fucking shots.  Ten shots.  He did almost half the bottle himself.  Wow.  Yeah.  Almost.  I had nothing to do with this when he dies of alcohol poison.  Nah.  He can't.  He's a big dude.  That's probably like three shots to a regular guy.  What?  We have a bit of a problem. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It would be a great problem.  Trust me.  All right.  All right.  What's that?  Nice.  This is the George Clooney tequila.  And that's the bottle of Roland's been drinking out of.  There's the Patron bottle.  Just hit the fucking garbage.  That's Roland's bottle.  Roland here at one shot.  But you remember that shot he took was a big shot.  Right.  Didn't you?  I haven't seen Roland since.  No.  Wow.  He's not in the office. 
[03:44:30]  I don't know where he went.  So you're going to take a shot.  You're going to take a shot out of his bottle.  Oh, my God.  He's pulling them.  He almost broke his nose.  He's fucking crazy.  And did we lose Denny for good?  Yeah.  Denny said he was okay giving up second place.  All right.  He said, I got to go to work.  All right.  All right.  You two want to do a little.  A cool cafe?  No, I didn't.  No?  He didn't do it yet.  You want a silver Patron?  Sure.  Or actually the George Clooney?  I would go with coffee.  I would go with coffee.  Do the coffee.  Yeah.  Do the coffee.  Do the coffee.  We got to get rid of the coffee.  All right. 
[03:45:00]  Here we go.  Wait, wait, wait.  Cheers.  Salud.  Salud.  You drinking?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's smooth.  Yeah.  Oh, that's smooth.  Oh, my God.  I need to know.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I need to know.  How drunk are you?  I need to know.  What?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a kill is better than the Patron, by the way.  You like that one better than the Patron?  I think he's got me a bottle. 
[03:45:30]  What does it taste like?  I think Roland has a bottle for me because I'm psyched.  But you rock.  How did that taste?  I want to join in for sure.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Roland wants another shot.  Roland.  Roland, give it a big shot.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Roland.  Roland, sit.  Roland, pour it out of the George Clooney tequila bottle.  I want to pass Pepper.  You do?  So how many shots would that be?  I think you just poured two and a half in there.  Two shots.  That's like almost a quarter cup.  Yeah.  So that's four.  Two?  Three.  Four? 
[03:46:00]  Let's call it three.  All right.  We'll call it three.  Give me a shot of donuts.  All right.  What do you guys...  Holy shit.  Hey, Roland, by the way, Iraq did just take a shot of the George Clooney tequila.  Said it went down really smooth.  It's smooth.  All right.  Let's do another shot.  Fuck it.  Iraq, no more.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Holy fuck.  Hey, got it.  And he washes it down with...  What?  The garbage.  That was good.  What?  What?  Oh, Iraq's now fucking fist bumping.  Fist bumping. 
[03:46:30]  Did you do yours?  Give it to me.  Iraq, do another one with him.  I did yours.  Not the coffee one.  Iraq, do two with him.  Do you want that one?  Pour him out.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Pour one out, baby.  Yeah.  Maybe even one for your homies.  Iraq, you're due.  Come on.  Yeah, one more.  It's your promotion.  Oh, he's pouring it on the carpet for the homies.  Iraq, do a shot with the guy.  Come on.  It's your promotion.  I did enough.  You did enough?  He's up to 11.  Maybe he needs a breather. 
[03:47:00]  But that's smooth.  Yeah, show him...  Oh, it is.  Is it?  Yes.  The last one was really smooth, huh?  Going down.  Is it smooth?  That's water.  What?  What?  How dare you, sir?  Iraq.  Iraq.  What's the proof on it?  Wow, that kid is a fucking gangster.  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  He thinks it's just water.  That's what you got to do to hang on Sundays around here. 
[03:47:30]  What proof is that?  It actually doesn't say.  I bet it does.  Wait, 40% alcohol.  40% alcohol?  Iraq, he says it's water out of the George Clooney bottle.  You said it went down smooth.  It went down smooth.  80% proof.  Do one more.  It went down very well.  Do one more shot.  Come on.  One more Clooney.  Little one.  One more Clooney.  This is my cup.  All right.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  All right.  That was more than I should have pulled.  That's a little more than a shot.  It goes smooth.  Let's go.  Wolf it.  Come on.  There we go. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, God.  He's getting prepared.  Yeah!  How is it?  How is it?  That's good.  Is it good?  It's good.  It's good.  He is fucked up.  Oh, my God.  How do you say that?  What?  Casa?  Casa Migos.  Tequila.  George Clooney.  Well done.  And how many Clooney shots have you done? 
[03:48:30]  Three.  That's about two.  That was the first one I did of Clooney's.  The rest were all Patron.  No, the other one.  No, the rest not.  No, you did one.  Iraq, it's smooth.  I love it.  Smooth.  That's, yeah, that's probably distilled a little different than the Patron, I would imagine.  Well done.  It just goes right down, huh?  Yeah.  That fucking shit is like half gone.  You, how are you feeling, Roland?  You did like a huge cup full. 
[03:49:00]  I know, but I weigh like four people.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I got a long way to go.  So that all equaled out.  Yeah, this is only his second shot.  Right.  So back to Sal.  You were giving him a talk to him.  Oh, my God.  Where is Sal?  Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  Yeah, sorry.  I was taking a call.  What's up?  What's the matter, Iraq?  You all right, Bubba?  Iraq.  Woo.  How you doing?  Everything is blurring.  So I'll be here, here, and here. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, you saw three of me.  Wait, which one's the Oopster?  Yeah, the Oopster, Opie, and Greg Hughes in the studio.  So you feel okay, though?  You're in this general area.  Do you have the spins?  A little bit?  No, I don't have the spins, but it's like all over.  It's blurred.  Holy shit, he's fucked up.  Oh, no, Iraq.  How many ants?  Your eyes are tearing, too.  How many anthony's you see?  He's right here.  Your eyes are over here.  Your eyes are totally tearing. 
[03:50:00]  Like, you're crying, tearing.  Look, there's tears running down your face.  And he can't keep them straight.  Iraq, why are you crying?  Look who he looks for.  I have no idea.  Those are called tequila eyes.  Are you okay?  No, they're called tequila eyes.  But I see his lip is quivering, too.  Iraq's crying.  What's happened?  I'm fine.  He's crying.  He's crying.  This is fucking bizarre.  It's not watery eyes.  He's actively crying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why are you crying?  I see a lip quivering.  Why are you crying? 
[03:50:30]  I'm not.  Maybe I need a donut.  Yeah, you need a donut, buddy.  Chocolate, chocolate.  He doesn't think he's crying?  I don't like chocolate.  That isn't just tears, like, when something goes down.  He's...  What's the matter?  That tastes awful.  Oh, this hangover is not going to be good.  I don't have sugar on it.  And it's going to hit. 
[03:51:00]  It's a donut.  Why is he crying?  The hangover is going to kick in.  He's got tears pouring down his face.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  He's got to build the worst of the week countdown.  Oh, that's good luck.  D-Rock's breaking donuts open and throwing them.  Oh, he wanted to do it.  He's got what he likes.  How's that one, buddy?  Oh, don't he?  He's crying.  Why?  I don't understand this.  Why are you crying?  H-Rock, you're emotional right now for some reason. 
[03:51:30]  Why?  Did the tequila just tap into, like, a region of your head?  I don't even know that I'm crying.  I am fucking baffled here.  Holy shit.  I have seen some shit with this radio show.  What the fuck?  You don't know you're crying?  You've got tears pouring down your eyes.  Nope.  Oh, wow, man. 
[03:52:00]  Rich Voss, where are you going to be?  You haven't talked to him.  You can't follow this.  No.  No.  I don't even know I'm crying.  What's on your mind, dude?  It's like a beginning of therapy.  Not a thing.  Not a thing.  I'm good.  Who's your least favorite person on the staff?  That would be...  Stop it, Sam.  There's a lot.  There's a lot, right?  Yeah.  Who do you think treats you the worst? 
[03:52:30]  That would be you.  You think so?  Yeah.  Why is that?  Because you're an asshole.  Oh, shit.  Why do you think that?  Because it deflects all attention off of you, but lays positive attention on you.  I see.  If that makes any sense.  I don't think it does.  I don't think so, either.  So I'm the biggest asshole.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve's checking in real quick.  He said, did that fuck put my show on the system before he got shit fixed? 
[03:53:00]  Yes, Dr. Steve, that was done once.  You should puke, man.  Maybe you should puke.  I don't feel sick, though.  Yeah, but you're crying.  You don't even know you're crying.  I can see this ending horribly.  You want to belly up to the garbage and stick your fingers down your throat?  Go home.  We're done.  Holy shit.  Scott and Todd end at 9.48.  And we're going to end at 9.52.  And it's 9.52 something. 
[03:53:30]  I'm staying in this seat for a little longer.  Go home.  No one needs you.  Go home.  No one needs you.  No one needs you.  Did you see how quickly this transformed?  Like, he was pretty buzzed and shit.  Then he went to a whole new fucking place.  And it was the Clooney shots.  It was the Clooney shots that put him over the top.  Because they're smooth.  Yeah.  Dude, this is dangerous.  Puke.  The donut really didn't help.  So, fuck you.  No.  Could you make yourself puke?  Could you make yourself puke?  I don't feel nauseous.  I don't feel sick. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, but we're like...  But to get it out of your system.  Yeah, because, you know...  We're a little worried.  That's like a 7 a.m., 8 a.m. bit.  No, I'm not doing it for a bit.  I'm saying...  I'm kind of thinking of alcohol poisoning.  I'm not thinking bit.  Yeah, I don't feel nauseous.  I can't really force myself to...  You sure?  You want to at least try?  No, I don't...  I don't think it would pay off well.  Eric, do you know, after all this...  Yeah.  After the fact that he wouldn't do anything... 
[03:54:30]  Who?  Sal is in there cheering with his hands up.  Why are you cheering, Sal?  No one gives a shit.  Sal, I love that everything's just coming out of Eric.  This is fantastic.  No one gives a shit about him.  Nobody.  He had a legitimate story...  Yeah.  To start the show.  Which is on the news right now...  Oh, it is.  ...about the train...  And he was an eyewitness.  ...on 42nd Street.  Yeah.  Look, I've taken really shitty photos...  ...that you've destroyed me over.  Like when that... 
[03:55:00]  Various planes crash in the Hudson.  I've taken photos where you're like...  Oh, it's just styrofoam.  That's not really anything.  When people have died in Hoboken...  Yeah.  ...on the...  Oh, the car crash.  Yeah, the car crash.  I've seen four of them.  You were an eyewitness, right.  One died on 57th Street.  Oh, the bus guy.  Yeah.  See, I remember all this shit.  Okay, I've taken photos of that...  ...and you've destroyed me for the fact...  ...that these photos really aren't very specific.  Whoa.  Ant's doing one.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:55:30]  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony, what are you doing?  No.  He just surpassed me.  What the fuck?  He's still drinking.  He's drinking directly out of the bottle.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen anything like this.  He's finished the bottle.  What?  Anthony just did a half a bottle of tequila.  Oh, my God.  Incredible.  Amazing.  And I know...  I know...  That he...  Doesn't like me. 
[03:56:00]  But...  This is like Jimmy.  But what?  That was awesome.  Yeah!  Erick, my friend, and I do like you a lot.  You're crazy.  You're crazy.  You're crying again.  You know that, right?  Now I know.  Oh, shit!  Because what he just did...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome. 
[03:56:30]  It was fucking beautiful.  Fucking beautiful.  And you can isolate that.  And take a photo.  I will.  Wow.  Not Sam on Twitter.  You'll see that later.  Erick!  Oh, Erick.  Erick's fucking tearing up this Friday.  I love it.  He is tearing up the Friday.  Tequila and Dona Day was a success.  Yes.  And...  Rich Voss.  We...  Yes, exactly.  We have not given Rich Voss's fair share.  Oh. 
[03:57:00]  Rich, where are you going to be this weekend?  I'll be at McGuire's this weekend and next weekend at the MGM Grand.  Grand.  Don't worry about me.  Don't worry about me.  No, no, no.  All about you.  Because I always got...  I always liked D-Rock.  I always got a lot of...  I want to know why Sam is an ass to him.  And how does Sam have the power to be an ass to you when you...  Because these two douchebags let him.  Oh, man.  And I'm making the metal sign to point at both of them.  No, I think they figured it out there in Radio Live.  Oh, shit. 
[03:57:30]  And I will say, as much as you shit on the first segment with the Scott and Tom rundown,  where they talk for an hour and seven minutes, 35 seconds.  They end their show at roughly 9.48, 9.49.  You are at 9.57, right?  Yes.  We're doing good.  I don't know how much you make.  How much do you think?  It's a fuckload.  I don't know.  How much do you think?  I don't know.  And it doesn't matter.  Shut up.  It doesn't matter. 
[03:58:00]  Shut up.  I love you guys.  This is crazy.  Shut up.  I love you guys.  I love this.  Oh, E-Rock.  The other two douchebags who we mentioned in the first hour, one makes over $4 million.  One makes $2 million just for doing the radio show.  You know the resentment they must have for not making the same amount?  Sure.  Resentment.  What resentment you two must have for the fact that they talk an hour and seven minutes.  Thank you.  And this company doesn't give two fucks about what you do. 
[03:58:30]  I hear you.  He's right.  I hear you, E-Rock.  Now we're all sad.  Now we're all going to stop crying.  I'm with you.  This will be replayed on the after show.  Yeah.  This will be talked about Monday.  Right.  And I'm sure at some point it'll be part of the worst of the week countdown.  I am so not tuning away from this channel until tonight.  Wait a minute.  I am so listening to Sam Roberts.  I'm listening to Ron and Fez.  I'll post for it.  This is a proper picture.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Try to puke some of the alcohol out. 
[03:59:00]  All right, all right, all right.  What about alcohol poisoning?  You can't force that because I don't feel lost.  Yeah, but you got at least ten shots of tequila.  This might be a Sam exclusive.  You have to listen.  Tell me this, E-Rock.  You're not exactly in the shape to build the countdown.  No, I'll build it.  Well, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, hang on.  Who knows how to build the countdown?  Who knows how to load it?  Who knows how to do your work and decided to spend the show sober?  The guy who doesn't care about the show.  Who's that?  That dude. 
[03:59:30]  That dude.  Sal.  He's pointing to Sal.  Sal, you better fucking defend yourself.  I'm going to throw a mini pizza party in Eric Saunders today.  Oh, a mini pizza party.  Up top.  Up top.  All right.  Sal, are you going to defend yourself?  I'll gladly help Eric through this one.  No, you won't gladly help.  You will do the countdown.  Because at 11 o'clock, as soon as Sam is done, unless Rod and Fez request me, I'm going home.  E-Rock! 
[04:00:00]  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  Done!  Fucking A.  How are you going to get home?  You can't drive.  Yeah, you can't drive.  Yeah, but there's car service.  Expense.  Expense that shit.  No, I can't expense that shit.  No?  No.  They will not let me for four hours of me getting hammered on the air.  Expense a drunk drive home.  Hey, look.  I fucked up.  You need to get me home.  They're not going to do that.  But you know what, E-Rock?  You didn't fuck up.  You shined.  You did shine.  You shined.  How's the wife going to feel about you being hammered this early? 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  Full supporter.  Full supporter?  Yeah.  That's nice.  E-Rock did Instagram a photo of the pad data that says E-Rock is drunk.  Oh, okay.  She did?  Yeah, she did.  Yeah, that'll go to a lawyer at some point.  Does Denny want to say goodbye?  No.  We got to get Denny in here.  No one cares.  No, Denny was pretty good.  How do you think about Dennis, E-Rock?  I love him.  Denny brought the professional aspect of radio.  He really did.  to the show, even though he was drinking.  E-Rock, on the other hand, brings a more jovial festive. 
[04:01:00]  I gave you a Friday show.  Yes, you did.  His gift to us.  My favorite part.  E-Rock's just belched into the light.  My favorite part.  He's fucking crying his eyes out and had no idea he was crying.  No idea why.  I've never seen that before.  I've never seen that in anybody.  Anybody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't have the...  He's crying again.  Hold on.  He's being a little emotional.  I swear you're crying.  Your face gets very emotional.  I swear you're crying.  Emotional, yes.  Crying, I don't think so.  But... 
[04:01:30]  Okay.  We don't have the bleachers.  We can't have a Friday on it.  We don't have the walkover anymore.  Right, right.  Right.  So, since it was brought up this week that...  And I really am happy that Anthony actually supported the cause towards the end of the show.  I had to.  You're trying to have a bottle of tequila.  Well, I try to find things that we've done during the week and maybe reapply it to the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Danny?  Hey, is this mic hot?  I don't want to touch it until it's on. 
[04:02:00]  Is this mic hot?  I don't want to touch it until it's on.  It's on.  If it's on.  That is so...  Who cares?  Every little aspect of radio professionalism, he knows it.  Who cares if it's hot?  Well, it's just, you know, like...  You don't move a hot mic.  No, you don't.  It makes sounds.  You don't move a hot mic.  No, no.  You don't want to make those sounds because then the listener's saying, hey, gee, what's  that?  It just distracts from the listening experience.  It doesn't.  We've got to learn these things.  How's this guy feeling over here?  We're constantly...  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  He's crying, but he doesn't know he's crying. 
[04:02:30]  We've got to get a listener to take him home.  You should probably tell Denny how you're feeling.  Denny did great.  The first three hours, he did great.  He's not needed now.  But he was great.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He just told me he's not needed now.  Who's the star now, Iraq?  Iraq loves telling people they're not needed any longer.  No kidding.  No kidding.  Past 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  We're in overtime.  He's going to hit the network news or something at the time of the hour.  Shut up.  Turn his mic off. 
[04:03:00]  Turn it off.  Who's the star right now, Eric?  The network news.  Turn it off.  Don't laugh at me.  Turn it off.  Don't laugh at me.  Turn it off.  And try to back time.  If you have two minutes, give me stay by Maurice Williams.  It's a minute and 36.  All right.  It's this Denny show.  This is one of the best Fridays ever.  Holy shit.  So fucking weird.  You guys have like a regular sign-off like I was on, now I'm gone or anything like that?  I was on, now I'm gone.  All right.  Let's do something. 
[04:03:30]  Next time we get together, I'll bring the coffee.  No need for the sugar because you, you're sweet enough.  All right.  Let's pretend it's your last show.  It's a benchmark.  It's a benchmark.  Because you've been fired many times.  You don't get to do a last show.  Okay?  E-Rock is a belligerent drop show.  Buddy goes, you don't get to do a last show, which is another radio thing.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know that's true, E-Rock.  To quote the Great Ridge Voss, Pingo.  You don't get to do a last show when you were fired from Terrestrial.  Right.  Do your final sign-off when, like, say, maybe CBS Infinity. 
[04:04:00]  Hey, how about Firefall?  Oh, he's still talking.  Goodbye, I love you.  You're trying to create something here, and you're walking all over it.  Well, because I'm used to talking with the music under me.  I can't take this.  Yeah, but no one cares.  Hey, we've got to get out of here.  No one cares.  He tries Firefall.  No one cares.  He's got a song for everything.  Wait, let's do this.  Give a topic.  E-Rock, throw it.  Let's try the topic and see if Denny has a song real fast. 
[04:04:30]  No.  A topic, please.  Please, please, please, please.  You don't get a final sign-off.  Usually, you don't get a final sign-off when you work on Terrestrial Radio.  True.  Especially when you work on a music station, because no one gives a fuck.  Right.  Well, no.  So.  Well, I wouldn't say you want to.  Pretend.  Pretend.  Yeah.  That this is your final show on whatever station you used to work at.  Yeah.  Give your final sign-off.  Like the company saying, look, you've put in a lot of hard time here. 
[04:05:00]  We really respect the job that you did.  But because of budget cuts or format flip or something else, you're not going to be working  here anymore.  Right.  So give your final sign-off.  Sal will pick a song.  No, he'll pick a song.  Denny needs his song.  It's his final show.  All right.  You should at least give him that.  Well, you got a song for me?  Sal will get the song.  No, what song do you want as your last song on radio?  Let me see.  How about Goodbye, I Love You?  I think that's a good one.  By Firefall. 
[04:05:30]  Sort of sentimental.  No one knows that song.  I know that song.  1979 hit music.  Yeah, but that's for nerds.  How about Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water?  There you go.  Really?  Oh, wow.  Really?  That's not cliche.  No, you pick your song, Denny.  Don't be influenced.  Well, I'm trying to get a good song here.  Go back to your first song.  How about the Tramps, Disco Inferno, as we burn this thing up?  Oh, man.  Come on.  You got it?  Which one do you want?  I want the single version of Disco Inferno.  Don't give me the seven-minute version. 
[04:06:00]  Because that's what they play on the Studio 54 channel.  Before he does that?  You guys got to do some more cross-promoting.  Before you do that, to Anthony and Toby.  To Anthony.  I am sorry I fucked this whole show up.  What?  Eric.  He's crying.  What do you got for me, Sal?  Hold on.  Hold on, Dennis.  Jesus, Danny.  You don't know good radio when it's right in front of your face.  You're stepping on a bit.  E-Rock, what are you talking about?  What do you mean you fucked it up?  What do you mean you fucked it up?  This is not what it was supposed to be. 
[04:06:30]  What was it supposed to be?  What was it supposed to be?  It turned out, it's...  Look at Rich.  Rich, do you miss partying?  Not at all, right?  What are you talking about, E-Rock?  Eric.  It was perfect.  This show was good.  Why are you crying and saying you messed it up?  What I fucking love about E-Rock, this is where he got honest and fucking got even with this fucking jamoke right here.  E-Rock, what was the show supposed to be? 
[04:07:00]  What was the show supposed to be?  Not this.  What were you thinking it was going to be?  You know what?  Fuck it.  You're welcome for four hours.  Wait, what?  But why do you think the show sucked?  Or that you ruined the show?  A drinking show?  Yeah, but look, the donuts are gone, the tequila's gone.  What kind of show did you want today?  You know what?  You're right. 
[04:07:30]  You had nothing planned.  What happened?  What happened?  You're confusing everybody.  Yeah, because you came up with a...  Most people say this was a pretty good show.  Tequila and donut show, but now you're saying that you're sorry you ruined the show.  What makes you think you ruined the show?  I don't think people really wanted to hear this.  But now that I'm thinking about it, and I've worked in radio for 19 years, yeah, they wanted to hear this.  So, I retract my apology and go fuck myself. 
[04:08:00]  What?  Jesus Christ.  This was awesome.  You sure?  You sure was awesome.  And?  Yeah, we went late.  I see that.  Yes.  It's past time.  He's running the gamut of emotions.  10-08.  Yeah.  Bonus time.  Bonus time.  Do we get bonus money, though?  Danny?  Well, you're stepping into somebody else's day party.  Yeah, Sam Schell, which... 
[04:08:30]  No, it's stepping into somebody else's day party.  Well, midday, though.  Are midday's that important in radio, Danny?  Well, sure.  It's the at work, you know, the at work listening.  Yeah.  Because people leave the radio on, you get all those quarter hours.  Oh, my God.  All those quarter hours.  How we doing, Iraq?  How you feeling?  I'm feeling great, Danny.  All right.  We got to make way, because don't forget, 12 o'clock this afternoon, the Lunchtime All  Request Show.  Can I do Danny?  And we'll be giving tickets away to see Rich Voss live.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:09:00]  Go ahead.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Iraq wants to do Danny.  9-08, 8-8...  You got the timer.  9-08, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling.  I like that.  Whoa.  Oh, there you should slip in a little weather, you know?  Mom is dressing the kids up, too.  You're just slipping a little weather.  Mom's dressing the kids.  Well, 65 and sunny, going up for a high of 70 today.  Make sure you bring the umbrella, that tomorrow night it might have some rain as you head  out to see Rich Voss live and in person.  McGuire's, this weekend.  Kind of do a little tomorrow night. 
[04:09:30]  It's 10-08.  Eric just said 9-08, 8 minutes after 8.  I know.  We all heard.  9-08, 8 minutes after 8.  We were letting that one slide.  We all heard.  Fucking, it's great.  How do these two not have their own show?  E-Rock and Denny.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock and Denny show.  It would be great.  It would be great.  See, that doesn't matter.  Where are you going to be this weekend?  I'll be at McGuire's in Bohemia, but that doesn't matter either.  Yeah, because no one's going.  No one's going.  Oh. 
[04:10:00]  Oh.  Oh.  No.  That's okay.  E-Rock's allowed to do that.  It's going to be great.  He's allowed to do it.  He's allowed to throw one out.  I do.  I love you.  I hate you.  I know.  It really is.  It's a classic, classic intoxication.  You might have to do more drinking shows.  Don't stand up.  I should stand up.  What are you, fucking Jack Lane?  Fuck off.  No, he wants you to project your voice.  Because Danny's giving you some fucking tips.  What's that?  Yeah, he's giving you tips.  Stand up.  Why don't you just stand up?  You bring it up.  Oh, yeah.  Your diaphragm, everything's straight.  You get a good fucking resonance to your voice. 
[04:10:30]  Make sure you take a big breath right before you hit the mic and give him a nice big smile.  Eric, you know Sal's in there videoing you?  You're failing to see no one give a shit.  Why does nobody give a shit?  Because Ope hates Sal.  He does, right?  He hates Sal.  It's just what it is.  And come Monday, we welcome Johnny Toobstix.  Johnny Toobstix.  Wow.  Trades going down over the weekend?  Yep.  Handsome Johnny Toobstix.  So the fans don't get pissed off?  Yep.  So, Denny, you ready for your final song? 
[04:11:00]  E-Rock set up the bit.  I think it's a good one.  Yeah.  Are we doing Firefall?  Oh, shit.  Whatever we do.  I got Disco Inferno.  All right.  Disco Inferno.  You know the ramp time in this song, Denny?  Just give it to me.  Who's that, Tavares?  No, that would be The Tramps.  Oh, The Tramps, right.  Tavares did the other one from Saturday Night Fever.  More Than a Woman.  More Than a Woman.  Which is written by the Bee Gees.  Sounds like a Bee Gees song, right?  Yeah, it is Bee Gees.  Of course, yeah.  Did it? 
[04:11:30]  No, I mean, it sounds like they were singing it.  Well, I've had myself a blast reliving the past here on a Friday.  The Opie and Anthony Show, Tequila and Donuts.  Don't forget Rich Voss.  He's going to be out there at Bohemia.  Make sure you go out and see him.  We're going to be out there with the van.  Sam's got the Wheel of Prizes.  You've got some Opie and Anthony koozies to win.  That's right.  Also got some chopsticks, too.  Bring him into the boss on Monday.  He'll get a kick out of that.  But my name is Dennis Falcone.  So much.  Don't forget this coming weekend here on the 60s on 6. 
[04:12:00]  Everybody's favorite cousin, Cousin Bruce.  You'll be here at 8 o'clock.  Make sure you join him.  E-Rock, he failed.  That's fucking beautiful.  That is beautiful.  I'm hoping on E-Rock, though.  How did I fail?  He failed.  He failed?  That was supposed to be his final sign-off.  He was just signing off for the week.  The thing is, you don't say anything, though.  You never say goodbye.  You never.  He knows that.  He can't do that.  The radio station goes on, and you don't want to do anything bad.  Shut up. 
[04:12:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hope's right.  Shut up!  Shut up!  This was your final send-off, and you promoted a fucking song.  He's a gentleman to the end.  He's a gentleman.  I would be fucking breaking the equipment.  I'm a station employee.  A professional.  No, you're not.  They fired you.  All right.  Say you go to another market.  Many times.  You know what he did on his last break?  Shut up.  I'm just a music jock.  I'm not Opie and Anthony.  Those guys are zany DJs.  I apologize for the insult.  They could do stuff like that. 
[04:13:00]  Dennis.  I'm not going to do that.  I know.  And you're looking for your next gig.  I totally understand that.  Fuck.  Oh.  You have to say the first next gig.  You need to say your final goodbye to the audience that made you.  No, no, no.  On the station that you're currently on.  You don't say goodbye because the station is 24-7.  It goes on forever.  You don't say goodbye because you know what happens next week?  They don't give a damn about you.  At 3 p.m., 6 a.m., whenever the fuck you're on?  Life goes on.  It goes on, dude, and guess what?  Yanni's doesn't give a shit.  And life goes on.  Exactly.  Life goes on.  Doesn't give a shit.  Life goes on. 
[04:13:30]  Anger.  Doesn't give a shit.  Crying.  Life goes on.  You say your goodbye.  And love.  And then you go off to Toledo.  Hey, look, my friend.  I've been in this business for 30 years.  What's going on in Toledo, Eric?  Jim Norton will be.  All right.  I don't know the place, but he's in Toledo.  That's it.  I mean, come on.  You rock.  I mean, I just can't take it anymore.  I'm not insulting you.  I've got to listen to professionals like radio war.  You're insulting me.  No, you're a veteran.  I'm not insulting you.  I have the utmost respect for you.  But this is your last show.  You should say goodbye to the audience that supported you. 
[04:14:00]  I said I had a blast reliving the past.  That built you.  Nah, it built me.  Come on.  You just move on.  That's it.  And then you welcome them back when you go to the next station.  See you on down the dial.  See you on down the dial.  How do you not love them?  You got them all.  But you didn't say that during your good minds.  That's the perfect thing you say.  I'll see you at 1560 AM.  Any further to the right, I'll be in the glove compartment.  All right.  You know what?  This guy's broke.  I've done them all.  I've played polka music at 1390 WRIV. 
[04:14:30]  You did?  I've done that.  You've done the polka.  Done it.  Done it.  Done it.  Love it.  Yeah.  Good.  You supported them?  Yeah.  That's all that matters.  Shut up.  Rich Vox, I apologize for taking up all your time.  I have nothing to do.  You're the star today, Joe.  Shut up.  This is nonsense?  He loves telling people to shut up.  I want to give you the opportunity.  Where are you going to be this weekend?  I'll be at 1590 down in the dollar.  Give me the glove box. 
[04:15:00]  We're in the glove box.  Denny really fucking did a great job today.  He stood out.  He's a professional broadcaster.  It's amazing.  This was a nice idea.  Great idea.  Wait, wait, wait.  Denny, you okay talking into a hot mic without your headphones on?  Yeah, well, let me see.  He goes, yeah, well, let me see.  And he grabs the headphones.  He can't.  I'll let you keep one ear on here in case, you know, we got, wait, traffic's on line one.  Okay, the traffic report on.  Please keep the one ear off.  All right.  All right, so you could hear.  We should give him one more song to go out on. 
[04:15:30]  I think you're right.  Really?  What do you want to go out on?  Yeah.  How about a no intro song?  What's that mean?  What's the fucking point?  What's a no intro song?  What's the point?  Well, because shout's always a great weekend party song.  And that starts right off the bat.  Oh, you want to give me something else?  What do you want?  You pick something in there.  Not Sal.  No, you pick it.  No, no, no, no.  Sounds useless.  Sounds useless.  Don't listen to him.  What do you want to do?  I know.  Working for the weekend.  Yeah, lover boy.  Go ahead.  Give it to me.  Here we go. 
[04:16:00]  This is your weekend party song right here.  It's like Jerry's gin joint.  Oh, what is this?  The live version?  The live version.  Sal.  Again.  Holy shit.  Handsome Johnny.  Tube steaks wouldn't do that.  All right.  It's time.  It's a five o'clock whistle.  We're getting out of the office.  You've been there all week working up a sweat.  But now it's time to work on a boogie on the dance floor.  Lover boy, come on in here and show us how to rock and roll.  Because you and I, baby, we're working for the weekend.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Woo-hoo. 
[04:16:30]  Fuck.  Love it.  Yeah.  And that's today's look at the worst of 2013 for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony will return live on Monday, January 6th, we hope.
