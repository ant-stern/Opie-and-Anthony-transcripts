<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves with characteristic self-deprecating humor, immediately setting a tone of boundary-pushing commentary.  They launched into a discussion of current events, starting with Lindsay Lohan's legal troubles, using crude and sexually explicit language to describe her and their fantasies.  Their commentary criticized the California justice system's perceived leniency toward celebrities.

The conversation then shifted to a New York congressman who resigned after sending shirtless photos to a woman he met on Craigslist.  The hosts used vulgar and misogynistic language to describe the photos and the situation, detailing the email exchanges and criticizing both the congressman and the woman.  The show transitioned to sports, covering a Bruins/Canadiens hockey game, focusing on fights and goals, followed by a discussion of the New York Islanders' goalie problems and the Cleveland Cavaliers' losing streak, including derogatory remarks about LeBron James.  They then discussed Mark Sanchez and his relationship with a 17-year-old girl, employing sexually suggestive language and commentary about the legality and ethics of the situation, analyzing a picture of Sanchez's room.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to discussing the documentary "Catfish," speculating on its authenticity, and relaying Kevin Smith's comments about the show and Howard Stern.  The hosts announced upcoming guests: a Baltimore Ravens player and JWoww from "Jersey Shore."

The show included a segment reminiscing about childhoods, including stories about inadequate winter clothing, makeshift sledding, faking illness to avoid school, and a shocking local news story about Little League coach David Hartshorn's arrest for molesting multiple teenage boys, detailing the graphic nature of the alleged abuse and child pornography.  Personal anecdotes about armed robberies followed, including one host's McDonald's robbery experience and a caller's bank robbery story.  The conversation touched upon gun use for self-defense.  A caller shared a story of their uncle being shot during a home invasion.  The hosts then engaged in insensitive jokes about the challenges faced by blind and deaf individuals before a caller shared their experience of growing up with deaf parents.  The discussion concluded with further commentary on raising children with severe disabilities.  An "Oscar Moments" segment featuring *The King's Speech* was interspersed.

The next segment started with a discussion of a blind architect and tipping habits, spurred by an email detailing Ian Halperin ("His Highness") allegedly out-tipping LeBron James.  This led to conversations about tipping practices and racial stereotypes.  Listener calls followed, including a story about a blind man attacked by a rabid raccoon and his wife's defense.  Ian Halperin then joined the show, elaborating on his story about LeBron James's alleged stingy tip, adding details and boasting about his own generosity.  He discussed other celebrities' perceived cheapness (Madonna, Bill Cosby, Gwyneth Paltrow) and his sexual exploits.  A caller challenged Halperin's account, leading to a back-and-forth, with Halperin deflecting accusations and making further boasts.  Another caller sought advice on success, and Halperin responded with self-aggrandizing statements.  The hosts attempted to fact-check Halperin's story.  Michael Oher then called in to promote his book, *I Beat the Odds*, discussing the accuracy of *The Blind Side* and sharing anecdotes from his life.

Two guests, Michael (author of "I Beat the Odds") and JWoww from *Jersey Shore*, appeared in the following segment.  The discussion covered Michael's post-NFL challenges and JWoww's experiences on *Jersey Shore*, including the accuracy of its portrayal, physical altercations, and personal relationships.  She detailed a difficult breakup and a police report.  The conversation included frank discussions about sex, JWoww's book, and her tanning line.  They discussed a former producer's aggressive pursuit of JWoww for an interview, reminisced about the *Jersey Shore* cast and Vinny's uncle, and engaged in banter about Long Island geography, hairstyles, JWoww's appearance, and the hosts' sexual experiences, often in vulgar terms.  The show concluded with a discussion about books, including promotional talk for JWoww's book, humorous anecdotes about book signings, and a discussion about a mistakenly played Bob Kelly bit.


The final segment heavily featured mockery of former colleague Nick Carpinelli, focusing on his perceived financial struggles, attire, and work justifications.  His studio was ridiculed.  They also discussed former employee "Scorch" and unflattering anecdotes, including the smell of his studio and low-budget interview setup with Craving Lucy.  The hosts mentioned comedian Bobby the Burn victim, announced upcoming appearances, and included an "Oscar Moments" segment with *The King's Speech* and a Pat Cooper commercial-like bit on erectile dysfunction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m. An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the O.P. and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  When you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Morning. 
[00:01:30]  That's nice.  That was like a car starting.  Well, that's my voice starting.  Yeah.  You just try out the voice.  Yeah.  So ready for broadcasting?  Is it working?  Who knows?  Good morning, everybody.  Hi there.  Some fucked up stories in the news that we've already discussed for a half hour.  Oh, yeah.  There are some stories that cannot wait for the air.  We have to just talk about them immediately.  We should roll tape, though.  I know.  Because now we've got to make believe we're telling each other for the first time. 
[00:02:00]  That's good.  It kind of simmers in your brain a little, and maybe a couple of new angles come in.  Well, we can start with this.  It's a quickie.  Lindsay Lohan is a kid.  Yeah, she's...  Just throw her in jail already.  Yeah.  What did she steal a necklace?  And now she's in court, and the judge is like, hey, you know, you're just like everybody  else.  Oh, really?  That's what he said.  He goes, you're just like everybody else, and you have to adhere to the law like everybody 
[00:02:30]  else, and then he goes, so, ah, one more chance.  They gave her another chance?  Yeah.  She's got one more chance?  She's got it.  She's on a bail.  I fucking hate the California criminal justice system.  She's not like anyone else, though.  No, no.  It's like a celebrity.  Anyone else would be doing some good time.  Not hard time, but you would be in jail for a little while.  And if she was like Fantasia?  Oh, fuck.  Jail for a year.  Oh, certainly.  Yes.  Jail for a year.  How are you on probation and you commit a fucking felony?  A felony theft and nothing happens to you? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Oh, do I want to suck her tits?  She won't see any.  She's out on bail.  They're big and heavy.  They're nice, but still.  She's in that tight-skinned white dress, so the judge had a problem with that even, but  in the end, he or she had no problem with anything.  She's out on bail, so she could actually get jail time, but it's...  When will it be decided?  Yeah, who the fuck knows?  Oh, this wasn't decided?  This was just bail?  No, but the guy says, you know, the judge is saying, hey, you know, count your blessings 
[00:03:30]  and, you know, adhere to the law, blah-de-blah.  But she won't even do that.  She'll do something else stupid.  She's a klepto, I guess?  She's everything.  I everything!  But you saw the necklace she stole, right?  Uh, yes.  It's not worth...  No.  If you're gonna fucking, you know...  Steal something.  Make sure it's worth it.  But she's stealing shit.  It was a lame-ass necklace, as far as, like, taking a chance at a felony.  There she is with her new duck lips. 
[00:04:00]  She's got her duck lip thing going, and she has her blonde hair now.  The top lip is not supposed to be bigger than the bottom lip.  Why are they doing that?  I'm a thieving platypus.  Wah, wah.  She's just hateable.  Yeah, she really is.  She's fucking hot, though.  Like, she had the...  Remember she had the fuck you on her nails recently?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, she's just a cunt.  And then look how she looks over at the judge and her lawyer.  She's looking like, oh, God, I gotta deal with this. 
[00:04:30]  Like, yeah.  She really is a stupid, duck-lipped, fat-titted siltch.  And she's got that same lawyer every time, right?  Just coddling her.  Oh, that lawyer must just be like...  And taking her money.  Cha-cha-ching.  Yeah, of course.  Cha-cha-cha-cha-ching.  She probably gets very excited when her phone rings, and it's Lohan.  It's Lohan.  It's like, oh, it's Lohan again.  Here we go.  All right, well, that's happening.  Yeah.  The skin-tight white dress.  Oh, look at those pictures.  Had everyone in a tizzy yesterday.  She has some of the best in and out of the SUVs and limo pictures. 
[00:05:00]  Ever?  Ever, I think.  Yeah, she got a lot of good ones.  Right up there.  Big fucking fat pussy shots.  Fucking nipples hanging out.  She's a disaster.  She's perfect for you.  Oh, she's great.  What a mess.  Can we get the number for Anthony?  Oh, no.  There was no chemistry between us.  Oh, that's right.  We met her.  Yeah.  I forgot we met her.  Yeah.  I think we met her just before she started really going bad, too, right?  Yeah, but you could tell something was going on. 
[00:05:30]  The wheels were shaky?  Yeah, she...  That's her?  God damn it.  Her right nipple is just hanging out.  Her big heavy tit is just hanging out.  Oh, God.  That's great.  You can't be mad at her.  Yeah.  She was ugly.  You know, throw the book at her.  You got to let the pretty ones out.  Half an ass cheek hanging out.  Her panties.  Her skirts tucked in the back of her panties.  She probably just took a piss behind a dumpster.  Oh, you got to love that kind of mess. 
[00:06:00]  Sure.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Does she even know her fucking dress is up on the red carpet?  Why would she care?  Well, this one's the golden carpet because that's the new thing.  Yeah, the gold carpet.  The carpet has to be a different color.  Gold carpet.  Pink carpet.  Purple carpet.  Holy shit.  Look at that.  No carpet.  Fucking badge.  And we're up to no carpet.  It looks like Britney's.  It looks deflated.  It looks deflated.  It's deflated.  She doesn't have, like, a beefy, like, or, or, uh, it looks like there's no, there's 
[00:06:30]  no structure under it, so it looks like you just blew up a balloon and then let all the  air out, and then that's what her pussy looks like.  Not even.  You blow up a balloon and then break it.  You know what I mean?  Because even, even a deflated balloon kind of has just a little puffiness to it, just  a little slight puffiness.  Not so much a deflated one.  You got to break the balloon.  But, like, just let it hang there, like.  It looks like one that's been hanging around your house, like, following you around for  a few days.  And then it finally hits the floor, and it's got, it's got, like, wrinkles in it.  Wrinkles in it.  Right.  She has, like, that kind of caved-in pussy.  I hate that concave vag. 
[00:07:00]  It just, like, out of fucking...  Caved-in.  It stinks.  Well, I bet you'd still put your mouth on it.  Is that saying much, really?  If Jim Morton would eat your pussy, is that really a statement?  Yeah.  Is there actually a bad pussy out there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, like, a real, you know...  Yeah, I've gotten some duds.  Yeah.  Duds.  Yeah.  Like, some real...  The ones that are kind of concave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were fucking spades shoveled out.  And a fucking pussy picture was taped on them. 
[00:07:30]  It's terrible.  Concave.  I hate them.  You need a convex pussy.  Do I?  Yes.  Concave is what?  It's...  Concave goes in, convex goes out.  Well, I mean concave, then.  Yeah.  You don't like the one that goes in.  No, they're terrible.  That's what he's saying.  Oh, I need a convex pussy.  Yes, convex pussy.  I should have known he would know.  That's a good one.  See, that's a good one.  I'm joking.  Yeah, what's that?  What is that arrow?  It's got like a fucking plato.  It's a pussy skin tan.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And what's like...  Look at what's coming out of that. 
[00:08:00]  That's what they're calling the normal part.  Oh, it's like an embryo.  It does.  It does.  Yeah, that does.  It's too thin.  So we got the Lindsay Lohan thing happening.  We're done with that.  Congressman?  Yeah, that's another good one.  You see the congressman...  Oh, you're looking at it right now, Jimmy?  This guy's great.  What a dope.  What an idiot.  What a dope.  Look at how he's flexing.  He's got his shirt off.  I guess what?  He's married and he wanted a little action.  But it's... 
[00:08:30]  Was he craiglisting?  Yes.  What was he doing?  So he goes on a craiglist.  He's looking for a girl?  A woman?  Looking for a...  To exchange massage.  And he...  What does that mean?  Well...  It's probably a...  I mean, you're not actually...  Breaks the ice.  Is that the icebreaker?  Yeah.  I think so.  I've never offered one, but I mean...  His name is Christopher Lee.  It's such a great name, too, for the vampire.  Christopher Lee.  Yes.  Anything worse than getting a massage?  And then she goes, all right, it's your turn now.  It's like...  No, it's awful.  It's like... 
[00:09:00]  You dig in with your thumbs, like, fucking three times.  And it's like...  All right.  Was that good?  Right.  Because I'm tired.  My hands hurt.  A married New York congressman resigns after he's accused of sending shirtless picture  of himself to a woman on Craigslist.  Sometimes my hands hurt.  The picture is just...  What are you doing?  He's shirtless.  He's shirtless.  In front of a mirror.  And he's flexing his right bicep.  His right arm. 
[00:09:30]  He's like, yeah, look at this, ladies.  This is what you're going to get, ladies.  Does that work?  Probably what I'm...  Aren't the ladies on to us when you flex your muscle like that?  Some whore would like it.  You think?  Yeah.  Seems kind of hack.  But he used his real name.  And he said that he was a lobbyist.  And this woman...  This is why you just have to hate people.  She did a Google search and found out who he was lying about something.  I guess about being married. 
[00:10:00]  She said he was divorced.  And she said everything to Gawker.  Like, what a cunt.  He's a dummy, but like...  Yeah, yeah.  But like, I hate these new...  This new thing with these fucking dumb whores...  Paddle tales.  That just turned the guys in.  Well, that was, you know, Tiger Woods.  That situation really escalated that.  Oh, that...  That's the new thing now.  Even before that, you got, you know...  Not as much.  The Tiger Woods really pumped that up, man.  How about fucking Betsy?  And fucking let's do some coke.  I'm not saying there wasn't any before that. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's not forget about good old Pat O'Brien.  One of the greatest stories ever.  That was a great, uh, fuck you.  I'm putting the tape out.  Yeah.  So, uh, what happens to this guy?  He had to resign?  Yeah, he, um...  He sent her a bunch of information and pictures.  I don't know what he lied about.  He may have...  Maybe he didn't give her a lot of money.  Or maybe he was, you know...  We're really amazed here...  Uh, we were talking about this before the show that, uh...  It was like...  And the picture is out that he posted on Craigslist. 
[00:11:00]  I quit!  I quit!  I quit!  I resign!  Like, which can only mean...  There's some other shit.  There is other shit that he didn't even want to sit there and try to defend himself and  keep his job because there's gotta be a parade of other shit out there.  There's a bunch of, uh, emails exchanged.  Yeah, yeah.  And once that shit comes out...  Usually these guys try to hang in there for a week.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I have the support of my dear wife.  Right.  Um, it was a misunderstanding. 
[00:11:30]  We have gone through some difficult times.  Right.  Oh, here's the email about where you talk about how you want her to strap a dildo on and fuck  you in the ass.  Perhaps that's why he retired.  I have a job offer from SiriusXM.  Yes.  They just offered me my own channel and a huge paycheck.  She said, are you divorced?  He said, yes.  He used his fucking, the email that is matched up to his Facebook account.  Nah.  Is that a rookie mistake?  What?  But, like...  This guy just made... 
[00:12:00]  It's Gmail.  It's free.  What are you doing?  This guy's an idiot.  What a dope!  He, uh...  He couldn't take it.  Are you trying to answer on the phone and it's not answering?  Yeah, seriously.  Really?  He had to just say, ah, I don't care.  I can't...  I don't have the time to get a new email and do this.  He was so horned up.  Yeah.  Oh, that takes minutes.  I can't do that.  He couldn't create a job.  What do you do?  Ah! 
[00:12:30]  I'm a representative.  Here's my email.  Fuck!  What a fool.  It was working this morning.  Travis actually watched Mars test the phone.  It's now working again, but it's...  It goes off and on.  Is it the moose?  I don't know.  Is the moose fucked up?  See, now I lift it up and put it...  Oh, now it's working again.  Yeah?  Do you think a trackpad would help?  Now it's not working again.  I wonder if it's because of the service you're on.  Sometimes I have problems at home with my mouse.  A trackpad, those little stupid things, I can't use it without that.  I can never use them on hard surfaces like this. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  So you need, what, a little ball?  No, no, no.  The, uh...  Do you cup the ball?  No, he's talking about the mouse pad.  Mouse pad, right.  The mouse pad.  Yeah, mouse pad.  I don't think...  Most people don't use mouse pads anymore.  Oh, I have to.  Well, the, uh, some mice work pretty good on all surfaces.  Other ones suck.  No, I don't cup the ball.  Some of the optical mice, uh, the laser reflects back into itself, and that's why it gets jittery  or it's not accurate.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This surface ain't too bad.  So, uh, is that it on this guy, the congressman? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, we'll see what happens.  He quit immediately?  I guarantee you other shit is coming out about this guy.  You see the quote?  I gotta work this out with my wife.  Ah.  Good luck with that one, pal.  That's never a good thing to have to make a statement that goes in the paper.  I have to work this out with my wife.  Well, did you read the, uh...  Oh, he's a hack.  Yeah.  The high hope.  What?  High.  Hope I'm not a toad.  Oh, yeah, of course she...  I'm a very fit, funny, fun, classy guy.  Live in Capitol Hill area. 
[00:14:00]  Jesus.  Oh, God.  He lives in Capitol Hill area.  Six pounds, 190 pounds.  Uh, six feet, uh, sorry.  Six foot, 100...  Six pounds.  I'm a preemie.  Six foot, 190 pounds, blonde, uh, hair, blue eyes.  He wrote, 39 lobbyists.  I promise not to disappoint.  Uh-oh.  Damn.  This is such an awful email exchange.  Oh, it's not to disappoint.  You got some more over there?  Oh, God, yeah.  She goes, uh...  He goes, after he sent out the shirtless photo, she says, she writes,  Are you sure that's not a photo from a JCPenney ad? 
[00:14:30]  He writes, LOL, no, here.  I just took one.  Oh, literal Christopher Lee.  He goes, I'm relaxing at home.  She goes, thanks.  So do you always send shirtless pics to women from CL?  Lee, sorry, it's all I had.  This is really getting saucy.  Oh, God.  What a horrid exchange this is.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  She writes, I was only joking.  Put a shirt on, take another picture.  He writes, so when was your...  Oh, no, then she, uh, he writes, so when, how was your last date and how'd it go? 
[00:15:00]  She says, a few weeks ago with a co-worker's cousin and didn't go.  I wanted to leave in 10 minutes.  Yours?  He goes, LOL, last Monday.  She was not as advertised, LOL.  Oh, shit.  How do people think you're not going to figure it out once you see them in person?  And she says they're hoping you let it slide or you're divorced.  He writes, yes, one child, you.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Yes, sure it would be, but he's not wearing one. 
[00:15:30]  No, it's off.  He is fitting in shape.  He didn't lie.  Yeah, but he's doing that little flex thing.  You never want to flex the biceps.  That looks pretty silly.  You just hope it looks good without flexing the damn thing.  Yeah, he's a true idiot.  He didn't know what to do with his other hand, maybe.  I guess.  Just hang in there.  You were watching the hockey, weren't you?  I saw you taking a peek.  What a great fight.  Everyone was tweeting me saying, you've got to take a peek at this Bruins-Canadians game last night.  14 goals, lots of fights. 
[00:16:00]  Goalie fights.  Crazy.  Blood.  Blood.  The blood was great.  Travis, did you check it out?  I watched the whole thing.  It was the best hockey game I've seen in the world.  Yeah, Travis was tweeting about it.  And isn't that the rematch from last week?  From last week?  No.  What was the game where they had like four fights within five seconds?  Oh, no.  That was Boston-Dallas.  Oh, Boston is just fucking beating everyone up, huh?  Yeah, no.  This game was great.  Oh, that was such a trip.  Oh, wow.  Who won the fights?  Who cares about the score?  Because I'm not a fan of the team.  The fights were kind of evenly won. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Because, I mean, there were so many.  There was a point where the game stopped for about ten minutes.  Oh, nice shot.  That's how a goalie fights, DiPietro, you asshole.  And then there's a hold over the head.  Wow.  And there's Wisniewski.  Oh, that kills me that you fucking got him, Travis.  These guys are just fucking animals.  Oh, yeah.  They're beating the shit out of each other.  Fourteen goals, too.  Bruins beat the Canadiens.  That's amazing.  Yeah, there was like seven goals in six minutes in the second period. 
[00:17:00]  It was nice.  Yeah.  Great game.  Good game.  At one point, there was 11 people in the penalty boxes.  Six Bruins and five Canadiens.  11 people.  Really?  At the end of the game, I think Boston only had five people on their bench, and Montreal  only had like six.  God damn, why didn't I watch this?  It was a great game.  That's a good one.  Wow.  Yeah, that's like old school.  Do they have a little rivalry or something?  They don't like each other?  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Bruins and Canadiens.  Yeah, they don't like each other.  That's great.  You hear about my old team, the Islanders?  No.  What now?  Well, we lost another goalie.  It turns out he dislocated his kneecap.  That was the injury.  He was warming up like two nights ago.  Yeah.  And also, they're carrying him off the ice, basically.  And we're like, what the fuck could have happened?  The game hasn't even started yet.  But there was something, I guess, in the ice.  His skate got caught.  That's what I heard.  I don't know if it's true.  And he dislocated his kneecap.  He's out for the year.  And I think he was basically the third string goalie. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  I'm not keeping track anymore.  Our DPH was out with a fractured face for six weeks.  So they had to make a deal and get a goalie.  I forgot what team he was on.  It might have been the Rangers, or the Rangers picked him up.  The guy's played five games since 2004.  And I think he's now going to be our goalie for the rest of the year.  That's your go-to guy?  Yeah.  And I don't even know if we have a backup.  Because I don't even...  I don't know.  He wouldn't even be the backup, so there can't be a backup.  He would never...  He would be like maybe a third string goalie. 
[00:18:30]  Now he's going to step up and be the starting goalie for the Islanders.  Maybe this is his chance to shine.  Oh, please.  It would be standing on his head.  It was Al Montoya.  And where was he from?  Al Montoya.  He was from Phoenix.  Phoenix?  Did the Rangers draft him originally, or am I...  Yes.  They did.  Okay.  Because I thought I saw Rangers in the story.  Yeah, he was drafted sixth overall.  Really?  Seven years ago.  And he played four games a few years ago. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  And that's it, right?  Yeah.  He started four games in the 2008-2009 season.  And that's it?  Yep.  And do we have another goalie?  Yeah.  You've got a rookie, Miko Koskinen.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Oh, yeah.  Miko.  A lot of Miko shirts out there.  You see people with Miko jerseys?  No, huh?  My tickets are just piling up in my fucking desk drawer.  What a waste of money this was.  Islanders Canadians tonight. 
[00:19:30]  I know.  Oh.  I know.  Well, they're a little beat up.  Maybe you guys will...  It doesn't matter.  We've been out of it for months.  Yeah.  For months we've been out of the playoff race.  At least we're not as bad as the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Are they terrible, huh?  They're the worst sports team in the history of professional sports.  Why?  They've lost 26 games in a row.  26.  Setting the record for all sports.  Who had the record before that? 
[00:20:00]  Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Tampa Bay...  They've tied the Buccaneers.  Oh, they've tied.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm sure they'll break the record.  Right.  They've lost 26 NBA games in a row.  That's really hard to do.  I don't blame LeBron for wanting to get out.  Huh?  I don't blame him for wanting to get out.  Yeah, LeBron proven he was the whole team because the team hasn't really changed much.  LeBron left.  That's about it.  And you're completely self-destruct.  And you're completely different without him.  That's amazing.  He had every right to leave.  I just want to say again, but it was just the way he did it. 
[00:20:30]  Right, right.  After all those years, that's all.  It was douchey.  Of course he has a right to go wherever the fuck he wants.  With that 26th straight loss, they tie the Tampa Bay Bucs for most consecutive losses.  I just said that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, he did.  I thought you said that they had overtaken the record.  No.  Well, then I am wrong and I should be severely punished.  Yes, reprimanded.  And then in other sports news, the Sanchez story's got legs.  But I don't know what the big deal is.  It turns out he's 22.  He's got legs, tits, and a fucking pretty face.  The 17-year-old. 
[00:21:00]  That's what that story's got.  17-year-old from Connecticut, Old Greenwich, I think.  Yeah, she's pretty nice.  Kind of a party girl for her age or something.  I don't know.  And this father, you see the father's a very successful gentleman.  Is he?  Well.  And the mother's like, we don't want to comment on this.  We want this fling to go away.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of business is he in?  I don't know.  I think he's in the financial business.  Is that what she looks like?  Yeah.  Not bad.  Not bad.  They cut the rest of the picture off. 
[00:21:30]  She got like fucking, they showed it down here and she's got nice big meaty tits.  Oh, Jesus.  But I don't really see what the big deal is.  Sanchez is 24.  That's not really, that's within range, man.  Yeah, that's her.  And it's legal.  There's no crime here.  Yeah, but that's just a page.  It's not her.  Oh.  So why is the news beating the shit out of this?  Because it's a legal move.  It's legal.  It's legal, but I think they're looking morally and ethically if he should be seeing a girl 
[00:22:00]  that's 17 years old since he is, how old is he?  24-ish.  He's only 24.  But some of these 17-year-olds you see, it depends on, you know what I mean?  It's, some 17-year-olds are extremely immature.  She doesn't seem that immature.  No, she goes clubbing and shit.  She seems like she, she knows what she's doing at 17.  They met in a club.  They did.  Is she talking about it?  They fucking chased her down in Grunge, Connecticut and got a camera in her face. 
[00:22:30]  Why do they have a disheveled bed right under her picture?  What is that about?  That's, that's the picture she took.  Oh, that's the picture.  To prove that she was with him.  Oh, okay.  Ah, ha, ha.  What a bitch.  Yeah.  Come on.  She took a couple pictures to prove she was with him.  How did this story get out?  What an awful set of furniture he has, by the way.  I know.  That's terrible.  She decided to talk?  Yeah, she contacted Deadspin.  Ugh.  And then, uh, and then she kind of backed off the story.  Because I think she, like, really liked him.  Because she says nothing but good things about him.  Yeah.  Why don't she contact Deadspin? 
[00:23:00]  Because she's 17.  Yeah, because she's 17.  So she contacts Deadspin and then Deadspin keeps trying to, like, you know, get more information  out of her.  And then she kind of lawyers up and her lawyer contacted Deadspin and says, none of this is  true, blah, blah, blah.  Like, I don't know what she was talking about.  It's not true, not true.  But Deadspin already had the photographs and they had most of the stories, so they're  like, we're just going to run into it.  That fucking guy was in here was boring.  He was a Deadspin guy, right?  Uh, yeah.  Eliza's dad is Conrad Chip Kruger.  What's this? 
[00:23:30]  What's this?  They call him Chip.  I thought it was Deadspin.  I thought it was a real website for a pin or something.  No, that's silly.  Oh, my daughter.  He's a partner in the Stanford, Connecticut financial firm Five Mile Capital Partners.  We was called Two and a Half Mile Capital, but then we merged with somebody else and became  five.  More miles?  Yeah, but like Continental or something.  I don't know.  Court Records show received a $48 million bonus severance and a deferred compensation package  when he left the firm Greenwich Capital in 2000. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God.  So this guy's loaded.  He's got Chip Kruger.  The hot daughter, Chip, a Chip Kruger, a Liza Kruger, a hottie.  Yeah, I go around slashing people in their nightmares.  Oh, like Freddy Kruger.  Only Chip Kruger.  I slash him with jokes and I make him laugh and he wakes up.  There we go.  Did you see Sanchez's room?  You saw the bed pictures.  Did you see the other picture where he collects tiny little football helmets like he's eight years old? 
[00:24:30]  Does he?  Did you see that picture?  It's not up on the website.  Are they signed?  They just showed it on TV.  Let me see his room for a minute.  They're tiny.  They're like the size of little softballs.  They're like football helmets.  Dude, is that like an attic room where the ceiling kind of comes to a point and the walls  are half of the ceiling?  It's probably his guest room.  He probably said, you know what?  I'm not taking you to my real room.  I'm taking you to the fucking guest room.  There's one picture over the bed of Giant Stadium from above. 
[00:25:00]  From above.  From a blimp or something.  Blimp view.  It's too small to be there.  What's on his night table?  A little alarm clock.  What does he have?  A twin bed?  What an ass.  It's like a little bed.  God, are they paying this guy?  The other picture, he's got like this huge Dell laptop.  No.  Yeah.  The picture that you were talking about with the little football helmets.  He's got a Dell laptop.  What's wrong with this fucking guy?  He's a nerd probably.  Well.  Probably just another nerdy guy, man.  He's got a 17. 
[00:25:30]  He's got some 17.  Jordan from Scranton.  Ronnie B is brilliant, man.  I've got to tell you.  Ron and Fez.  11 to 3.  Jordan writes, you've got to go with Ronnie B's rule.  Half your age plus seven years.  That's the lowest you could go.  So by the Ronnie B rule, Sanchez is 24.  He could date girls as young as 19.  Half your age.  And then you've got to add seven.  And then you.  Wait a minute.  It doesn't work out for us older guys.  How do you add seven?  Wait.  That's Elijah Muhammad. 
[00:26:00]  Did you say that?  Elijah Muhammad told Malcolm X that's how you marry somebody.  Oh, really?  Half your age plus seven.  I think that's Islam.  All right.  So the formula is half your age.  So Sanchez is 24.  So that brings it down to 12.  And then you add the seven.  So 19.  He should go as low as 19.  Half the girl's age plus seven.  How about that?  I like that better.  That would make her 10.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  It happens.  Better than a girl in her 30s. 
[00:26:30]  I've been cut off.  Why is this such a great story?  Look, there's the tiny little.  Look at the tiny little football helmets.  Oh, look.  That's like what a little kid would collect.  Yeah, he's got little football helmets there.  Look, he's got the Jets.  I guess.  What's he doing?  I don't know.  And look at it.  Yeah, look at his old Dell computer.  A horrible old Dell computer.  Does he have a dock for it?  His house sucks.  Yeah, he's got a dock for it.  He's probably renting.  He probably lives in California when he's not playing for the Jets. 
[00:27:00]  Travis, do you know any of this shit?  Yeah, he lives in Jersey, I think.  No, I know he lives in.  Oh, does he live in Jersey full time now?  Yeah.  Yeah, because his house looks really lame.  I love you.  Maybe he hasn't shopped for a real house yet.  I don't know.  It says, I love you, T.O. Mark.  So, Uncle Mark.  It's his nephew.  Made a little montage.  His little Spanish nephew.  Not a montage.  What?  Like a collage of pictures.  Right, sure.  A decoupage.  A decoupage. 
[00:27:30]  What a horrid room he has.  So?  He's going to impress a fucking chick that's grown up in a house where the father has $48 million from a bonus.  And you take a home to that?  What's on his little windowsill in that picture?  Yeah, we're zooming in to try to see all the shit.  Candles?  All right.  Romantic.  And what's the upside down poster?  Broadway schmo?  All right, that's a Broadway Joe. 
[00:28:00]  That's a goof on Broadway Joe, Joe Namath.  So, Broadway schmo, they must have been calling him Broadway schmo, and he keeps that in his room?  That's kind of funny.  That's like having the Opie and Dopey newspaper cover.  Well, you have to frame that.  Oh, there it is.  Sanchez loses five interceptions as lowly bills sink jets in overtime.  Sink jets in overtime.  And then big fucking letters, Broadway schmo.  So he decided he needed that.  Just because he made Daily News cover.  That's what we did. 
[00:28:30]  If you're going to be on the front page of the paper, who cares if it's for really bad stuff?  You've got to frame it.  That's great.  I like this guy.  I framed the Opie and Dopey.  Yeah, why not?  This guy's all right.  Yeah.  And the girl's...  Fuck.  Nah, the girl's just dope.  Well, she's just a dumb, you know, youngster.  But, go with the Tiger Woods thing.  Look, you sleep with an athlete.  You've got to get that info out there immediately.  Yeah.  Because it might mean a little fame, a little fortune.  Yeah, it looks a little sketchy. 
[00:29:00]  Like, I'm reading more about it.  Really?  And she contacted Deadspin claiming that one of their writers was, like, trying to figure out  who Mark Sanchez hooked up with on a New Year's Eve thing, which was her.  So, AJ replies with, you know, we weren't doing that story.  And then she kind of just told him everything that happened to clear her name.  But they weren't wondering to begin with.  Ah, okay.  It's a little, you know, like...  She forced herself in there.  Yeah.  Forced that story.  She shoehorned her young millionaire's vagina. 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  How lovely.  You know what that is like?  It's a non-story, though.  But the news is...  I mean, they're all in.  Who cares if she's 17?  It's totally...  How old is he?  It's legal.  It's legal.  What?  He's 24.  24, 17.  Age, you could say, I think is 16 in Connecticut, I think they were saying.  Just looking like it's like...  It's not even close.  He's a quarterback for a professional football team.  So, I guess he's supposed to act in a certain manner.  He did.  He stuck his dick in someone. 
[00:30:00]  That's what you should do.  Plus, these 17-year-olds are not like 17-year-olds when we were growing up.  Unfortunately.  17-year-olds when we were growing up?  Come on.  They were like...  Yeah.  Ridiculously immature.  Were they, though?  Because I remember some big-titted chicks back then.  We had one in our high school that she knew what she was doing.  Yeah, there were some good ones.  But most of them, I mean, they never dress like they do today.  I think Britney Spears started all that for us.  Thank you, Britney.  Throwing some real slut wear. 
[00:30:30]  Who do you think started it?  I gotta go.  Because when I was growing up, fucking high school girls did not dress like they're dressing  now.  There's a little...  I think there's a little Lindsay to do with that.  Lindsay Lohan?  Because everywhere I go, it's always the leggings with the Uggs.  Not like I'm complaining.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Well, they keep updating the look.  But I'm thinking who starred it started.  I think it might have been Britney Spears.  I don't know, man.  She's dressing all fucking sexy in that goddamn first video of hers walking down the hallway  in the Catholic school girls' school.  I just see chicks walking around.  I think that was the moment things changed.  That was a good one.  Basically, what amounts to pantyhose and boots. 
[00:31:00]  Pantyhose and boots.  Do you know how great that is when you're on an escalator with that ahead of you?  Yes.  They cough?  It gets almost see-through.  Yeah.  Well, they cough and you can see the outline of their pussy.  Oh, that's great.  See a big pink sock down her pant leg.  It's called pulses when they cough like a dog's ass.  That would be disgusting, wouldn't it?  It would be.  Like a little pink slinky in her underpants.  Madam, your asshole's tumbling out, please. 
[00:31:30]  Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Hey, I'm wondering if you'd respect Mark a little bit more if you had an eight-year-old  Jeep that produced no heat.  Well, that was a...  I have a new car, finally.  Well, now it's a couple years old.  I respect Sanchez.  I have no problem with this one.  He's 24 years old.  He's a fucking starting quarterback for the Jets.  Exactly.  And he's got 17-year-olds throwing themselves at him.  Why not?  It's legal.  Yeah.  No, no.  That's all good.  I just meant he was a little slow like you to embrace his wealth. 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  You were criticizing that room.  Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, yeah.  I have to punch it out.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Yeah, to this day, I don't spend as much as I should, I guess.  He lives on the Trump golf course.  What?  Mark Sanchez does?  Yeah.  Trump's got just an amazing...  Hold on.  Yeah.  Why would this fucking...  Does he live in the fucking Caddyshack?  Phil in Jersey.  They look like shit.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, that's the report. 
[00:32:30]  He's living in a townhouse on the Trump golf course right in central Jersey there, Bedminster.  Real nice new course.  Yeah, it's a new course with all those condos and stuff, right?  Yeah, if you watch Hard Knocks at all, it's near their training facility, which is in Florham Park.  Didn't Cervic Construction do those condos?  Funny you should bring that up.  Golf courses and cemeteries.  Biggest waste of prime real estate.  Did you see John Daly's new golf bag?  No.  What is it?  Is it the one? 
[00:33:00]  He went for it.  He went for the Rodney?  I don't know if he's bringing it on tour, but I think he tweeted yesterday.  If you can find that, Danny, I don't know.  John Daly's new golf bag, but it's fucking...  It's Rodney's golf bag from Caddyshack.  Yeah, the big one.  Yeah, the big one with the TV screen on the side.  Yeah, the cassette player and the tap in it.  And it looks like he has the TV screen.  I don't know if it's a fake TV screen.  I don't know much about this golf bag, if anyone knows.  That's pretty funny.  But it hit yesterday, John Daly's new golf bag.  I forgot what website I saw. 
[00:33:30]  There it is.  That is totally the Rodney.  He went for the Rodney bag.  How great is that?  Wow.  With the big old school TV screen?  Wow.  Yeah.  Is it exact?  I couldn't tell, Ann.  I don't think it's exact.  But it's...  It's close.  It's close?  Yeah.  Is that why he's doing it, you think?  Because of Caddyshack?  Yeah, Daly rocks.  Daly is a rock star, man.  Fucking Daly rules.  We had him on the show once.  I wish we could have him on more often.  Yeah, that is true.  On the phone. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, he was good.  And he was really, really cool.  So...  Oh.  I, uh...  Last night, gotta say, watched Patrice's, uh, special.  I was there for the fucking, uh, taping.  Yeah.  I watched the special.  He's so fucking funny.  It was good, right?  I just saw part of it when he shot it.  It was...  It was really good.  He just is...  He's...  He's vicious, but then he's got that...  That smile.  He...  The women are, like, cringing at some of the shit he's saying.  The guys are all laughing their balls off. 
[00:34:30]  He's calling out people, uh, for just being assholes, and, and women for being hypocrites,  and, and guys for not being honest, and it just really is, you know, the title's The  Elephant in the Room, and he really is just, like, like, saying shit that is making  people so uncomfortable.  Yeah, and everyone else is laughing.  And it's just hysterical.  I don't know when it's on, Comedy Central.  February?  We got the exact date, so it's coming soon.  We got the advanced disc that has, uh, some extras on there, too. 
[00:35:00]  He...  Where he's just being mean, which is great.  Right.  Like, the extras are, uh, it's, it's him just being mean, and it's great.  Did the, uh, did it make the extras where he went after the one girl in the audience?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, is that beautiful.  And she's just sitting there, like, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, and he's, he's  looking at it, going, meh, meh, meh.  Yeah.  Just calling her out.  He fucking nailed it, man.  That special's gonna do really well for Comedy Central and Patrice O'Neal.  Elephant in the Room?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, yeah, I watched that last night.  I was fucking laughing. 
[00:35:30]  Five minutes in, I'm just fucking laughing, going, this is, this is great.  I saw, uh, the movie Kevin Smith, uh, recommended.  Oh.  Catfish?  I still gotta see that.  Jimmy, I saw the...  Yeah, I watched that last night, too.  Are you all in now?  Yeah, I finished watching Catfish.  He hasn't seen it, and...  But are you all in now?  I was exactly where you were yesterday.  Halfway through, I'm like, what?  And then I watched to the end, because everyone says this, and Kevin, I think, said it, too.  Watch to the end.  I'm all in.  I don't know.  I gotta read more.  I liked it.  I definitely liked it.  And I got it figured out. 
[00:36:00]  I gotta watch it again, or I gotta read more about it, because it's just one of those.  It's just one of those.  I'll...  I gotta figure it out.  I wanna...  Uh...  I'll tell you during the break.  I was surprised at my reaction at the end.  Like, I was surprised how I...  I didn't feel like I would've thought that I would've felt.  Um...  Real or fake?  I guess we could say that.  I...  Those guys have a lot of balls, if it's real.  They have a tremendous amount of balls.  I say real, and I say you're wrong.  Okay.  But I don't wanna say any more. 
[00:36:30]  Because I don't wanna ruin it for people.  Give me that Sharpie real fast.  Someone talk.  Where is it available, by the way?  It's on demand right now.  Oh, it is?  I got it on iTunes rental.  I don't think you get it on Netflix.  I think it's kind of in...  No, I bought it on iTunes.  Not Netflix?  No, I don't think so.  I think I know a site that has it.  Is it on still in theaters in the hotels, maybe?  Oh.  But yeah, but I don't know if it's one of those movies.  Like, it's not gonna do great numbers.  It's more of like an artsy movie.  Yeah, but sometimes hotels have those. 
[00:37:00]  Um, I'll tell you during the break.  Okay.  Because, uh...  Ah, fuck.  I wanted...  I watched it on my computer tonight.  Wait, if Anthony watches it, then we can discuss it tomorrow.  I'll watch it.  And then the people that don't wanna know, they can maybe turn off the show.  I don't wanna ruin it for Anthony.  It's weird.  You know what?  It's funny, though, because...  I liked it a lot.  Yeah, I liked it, too.  And you know what?  That's why I like documentaries a little more than like regular mall cop movies.  Like, how am I supposed to watch The Hangover when there's great stories like that  hanging around?  Like, I'd much rather watch something that gets me wondering if it's real or not, as 
[00:37:30]  opposed to knowing that it's completely fake like a regular movie.  Right.  Like, there's something intriguing about just wanting to know.  I think...  I think it's as...  I think it's as real as it gets.  Go la la la.  Oh, wait a minute.  But...  Oh, wait a minute.  They decided they needed to make a movie.  Around it?  So, they probably had to redo something.  Ooh.  I wondered that, too.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Certain moments seemed like fucking college acting. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I know, because that's what I do.  But the reason was because they had this and that, and they're like...  Gotcha.  That makes a lot of sense, actually.  But because some of the other scenes looked as...  Then they said, look, we're going to do this, and then it was real.  Yeah.  They had to go back to get the beginning of the story.  Yes!  Yes, because there was plenty of times.  There was plenty of times where I was just like, this is so incredibly fake.  It's just incredibly fake.  They didn't...  I was insulted.  That's why I turned it off, because I was like, fuck this movie for thinking I'm an asshole,  and I turned it off.  They didn't... 
[00:38:30]  And you all right?  Can you hear us?  You hear us?  All right.  Now, can you hear us?  No, no, go, go.  I don't think they realized how much they had.  That was great.  And then went, fuck, this would make a good movie, but we have to fucking film some of  this stuff from the beginning.  No, that makes...  That's an angle I didn't think of, and that makes a lot of sense to me.  That's my take on it.  No, I think that might be the way to go with it.  It was just funny hearing you make... 
[00:39:00]  You sound like a cat getting your asshole tickled.  Is that your take on it too, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You sound like Dr. Steve sleeping.  I don't know.  Know why?  Kind of, yeah.  Because I felt the same way Danny did.  Travis had to ask me if we were done talking about it, because he wants to see it too.  He's watching it on, I think, tomorrow, so he just completely cut us off in the other  room.  I will say it's good, though.  I mean, I like it.  It does make you wonder.  I won't put this on the air, but this is why I think it's completely real in the end. 
[00:39:30]  I won't lie.  Yes.  That part was.  Because there's no way you could get away with that.  I agree.  No fucking way you could get away with that.  That's what turned me.  There was one scene where I was just like, and you probably know which one I'm talking  about, both of you guys.  Yeah.  And I was just like, okay.  Yes.  Okay.  And then I thought, I should pull that for the show.  Yes.  Yeah.  I, I, um.  That's, that's when I went, this has to be real.  That element of it also made me think like, it had, because you wouldn't, if you were  making a documentary, think to do that.  Like, that's, that was a weird angle.  I mean, that's the point where they go back to, I know the listening audience has no idea 
[00:40:00]  what we're talking about, but, uh.  I know.  I apologize.  When, uh, when they go back to the car and they tell the third guy, like, yeah, it's  okay.  That makes a sound.  And he's like, are you sure?  And they're just like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're done.  We're done.  We were done five minutes ago.  We just wanted to hear that noise.  Very, very strange.  What a creepy noise.  Hey, uh.  Speaking of Kevin Smith, he was on Joy Behar.  Was he? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  He was talking about, uh, us and, uh, and Howard.  Really?  Yeah.  What's going on there?  Um.  He, he was praising us.  Oh.  And he said that he doesn't really go on Howard, but he did try, uh, this last visit to New  York.  He openly admitted he tried.  Oh.  And they weren't interested.  So I guess Joy Behar asked him about it.  It's quick.  Are you feuding with Howard, Howard Stern?  No, uh, not at all.  I was on, well, last time I was on.  What's that about?  What's that question about?  Somebody, uh, I've been on Stern in a few years. 
[00:41:00]  I go on Opie and Anthony now.  I go on every radio station on the planet, but I haven't been on Stern in a couple of years.  And that's only because the last time I was on, I was promoting, uh, an evening  with Kevin Smith, a DVD I did, um, that was like me speaking and stuff like that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Can you believe it?  Just speaking.  And I'd been on Stern many times.  He'd called me, he would call me up like one week every morning to ask me a comic book  question.  I was always there.  I grew up listening to that show and whatnot.  Uh, that day when he had me on, it was, he had this kind of really reductive, like Kevin  Smith is always calling in and trying to be on this show. 
[00:41:30]  That broke my heart.  I was like, I've never once called this show asking to be on it with the exception of this  time to promote this DVD.  And at that point I was just like, I, you feel weird.  Like you're going over some dude's house who's the popular kid.  And then when you're there with him alone in the room, he's nice to you.  But then when other people are looking, he's like, look at that guy.  That guy's a loser, everybody.  Right.  Well, he's like that.  I like to go to Opie and Anthony and you can literally sit there and those dudes are like,  take the ball, dude, tell stories.  Like we talk all the time.  You talk, tell your stories.  I say.  So for me, I'd much rather go to a place where they shared a ball and they're not going 
[00:42:00]  to make you feel bad.  Like just to get on the show, you have to run a gauntlet of insults.  And it's like, I'm too old for that.  I say.  And there are people who are willing to talk to me who don't want to insult me either.  I say.  So I'm not mad at them, but I'm just like at this point.  And then I tried to get on this week because I was in town and a lot of people on Twitter  were like, go on Stern, go on Stern.  And it had been like six, seven years.  So I was like, you know what?  I'm here in town.  I got a free morning on Wednesday.  I'll try.  And I tweeted Gary and Howard about being on the show, but they were like, we're book  solid.  So everyone said it's because I did Imus and I also did ONA, but whatever. 
[00:42:30]  I don't play those politics.  Okay.  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Joy B.R.  Okay.  I like her though.  Yeah, I do too.  I do like the Joy B.R.  Joy's a good egg.  Yeah, there you go.  That was kind of cool.  Kevin Smith's aight.  Kevin Smith is the shit, man.  He's very honest.  He'll just tell you like it is every single time.  Good, good, good guy.  Yeah.  He's very honest.  But I'm sure people will now spin that audio making it to something, but he told you exactly 
[00:43:00]  what it was.  So in his opinion.  Whatever.  Whatever.  All right.  What do we got going on today?  We got Michael coming in.  Michael.  Mike.  How do you see?  Huh?  I think he's, I don't know how to say his last name, but he's, where is he?  Michael Ower.  Yeah.  He plays in the Ravens.  Yeah.  He's the inspiration for that Sandra Bullock.  Blindside.  Yeah.  Blindside.  Precious.  I'll say that when he's here.  Will you?  He's a big dude.  No.  Not at all.  And who else?  And JWoww.  Okay, I thought today. 
[00:43:30]  From Jersey Shore.  Yeah.  We're getting all the Jersey Shore people.  Gee.  What time are they in?  Nine o'clock.  Okay.  For JWoww.  Yeah.  She's very sexy.  She's like, I hope she lets me touch her bosom.  She might just go hold him.  I'll go right.  I'll hold her bosom.  You'll just go right.  I would have told, like, to be silly.  I wouldn't do it for me.  It was for the show and hold him.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we can take our first break.  I'm going to eat.  Let's eat.  Let's eat.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chris Lee is giving his little retirement statement, his resignment statement.  He was the shirtless guy.  Yeah.  Congressman.  Like, oh, I've got to work on things.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Sorry to my constituency and my wife and family.  He doesn't have to work on anything. 
[00:44:30]  That's what he wants to do.  That's absolutely what he wants to do.  Why do you have to fake it in the media and go, oh, I've got things to work on.  Yeah.  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, that's what you want to do.  So go do it.  You were working.  You were working, all right.  He was working it.  Flexing that bicep.  Working that bicep.  Yeah.  Every time you look up, it's on another TV screen.  Yeah.  That's the big story.  And let me tell you.  Do you like the Eskimo coat that the women are wearing?  Are they wearing it?  Some of them look cute in it.  Some?  It's big this winter, right? 
[00:45:00]  You can't be big in it or else you look like a real Eskimo.  You know?  Right.  You want to look like nice.  I'm talking about the one where the hood goes up and then it's very, how do you call it,  like furry, but long furry around the rim of the hood.  Around the face.  Those used to be snorkel jackets.  I've seen that coat all over New York.  Remember in the seven days open?  Do you remember the seven days at all in your elementary school days?  It was in kindergarten. 
[00:45:30]  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  75 it was.  Snorkel jackets were huge.  They were the cheapest jacket.  I remember.  Because they were easy to make and cheap, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Real cheap.  And I never had one because I hated them.  And I noticed a lot of the ethnic and financially destitute children had them at school.  Fuck, I should have had one.  And I never, although it was put a different way in my house. 
[00:46:00]  And I think my brother wanted one or something.  And he asked my mother to get one.  And my mother said, no, the, and then she threw a horrible word out there.  She said, they wear those.  And my son isn't going to wear those.  Same thing with PF Flyers.  I wanted the PF Flyer high top black sneakers.  And she goes, you're not going to go to school looking like a.  And then that word.  That word came out.  Oh, boy. 
[00:46:30]  Perhaps that's why I embrace it so these days.  I was taught at home.  It's just I'm perpetuating.  I learned it from you.  Okay.  The hatred.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  My old days of just hearing that word every day I heard that word.  I don't remember my winter coat.  So I'm starting to think I never had a winter coat.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  You sure it wasn't just passed down?  I don't know, man.  Hand me down?  I have no memory of a winter coat when I was growing up. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Do you have memories of being really cold?  Yeah.  Okay.  Maybe you didn't have a winter coat.  I remember wearing Wonder Bread bags in between my shoes and my socks.  It's Gore-Tex.  Did you do that trick?  Gore-Tex.  Seinfeld.  I love it.  Did you do that trick?  What?  The Wonder Bread bags?  I only use the Wonder Bread bags.  Yeah.  I use those.  I forgot how we did.  I think you put your bare foot in the Wonder Bread bag. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, no, you had to do the sock.  Then the sock.  When did you guys do that?  And then the shoe.  You had to do sock first, then Wonder Bread.  Then another sock.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember the combo.  I remember we did it, though.  To keep your feet dry?  Dude, we didn't have, like, fucking winter boots.  We had sneakers or whatever, man.  We didn't have...  And I sprayed Skeeter pellet on it so I would get out of school.  But the teacher told me, if he ever catches me spraying my feet with Skeeter repellent...  Yeah, we didn't have a lot of footwear. 
[00:48:00]  We had one pair of shoes that had to get us through the...  It had to go around?  Oh, yeah.  I can't go out because my brother's wearing the shoes today.  I don't think...  Yeah.  I don't remember having more than one footwear.  So then he had accessories for it.  Wow.  Wonder Bread bags in the winter to keep things dry as you're running around.  Yeah, I used to do that because you'd wear those boots that had the little clips on them  and stuff.  Remember that?  Like fireman boots.  Right, right.  The boots that, like, had eight clips on them.  And they never were really waterproof. 
[00:48:30]  So when you went sledding and whatnot, you needed the Wonder Bread shit on you.  What did you use for sledding?  Because we didn't have sleds either.  We had the sled and a toboggan.  You did.  But sometimes we had an air conditioning and heating guy as our landlord.  And he put this huge garage in our backyard where he stored all of the ductwork and everything.  So sometimes we'd just take some sheet metal and roll up one edge and...  Oh, no.  We went way better.  Almost decapitate yourself. 
[00:49:00]  We had a pretty big hill in the back of our house.  And we were always remodeling.  Was it cemented?  No, no.  Thank God.  No.  And we were always remodeling because they were always bringing in kids, having kids.  So the house always had to be extended.  So there was always supplies around.  And my brother, Scott, I believe, realized, fuck, we could take paneling.  Paneling?  One big sheet, though.  Oh, that's pretty good.  We didn't even cut it down into small sleds. 
[00:49:30]  And then we got to the top of the hill and we all would jump on this thing.  It's like eight by six?  Like four or five of us at a time would all jump on at the same fucking time and see who  would be the last one on it.  And then we finally figured out, yeah, if you drill a little hole and get a little rope,  then you could...  You got to pull up because it would dig in.  Because what would happen, it would dig in and fuck up your ride.  Yeah.  So then we finally realized, okay, we could get a little rope or something and make a  makeshift huge fucking toboggan sled thing. 
[00:50:00]  Garbage pail lids, too.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that until right now.  I was a little kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little garbage pail lid.  That was fun.  And I think they did buy us some sleds.  Yeah, I think we did have them.  But then the paneling was way fucking cooler.  It worked really well in the oldie days when it would snow.  And then you'd get the ice storm that put that coating of ice over the snow.  Right.  And you would go a thousand miles an hour down the hill. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was frightening.  Where was your dead man hill?  We had it in the woods.  Every neighborhood had a dead man's hill.  It was in the woods next to my house in East Northport.  And it was crazy because it was a big hill with a trail that you would toboggan down or  sled down.  And then it just ended in a shitload of trees.  So you had to either stop or try to avoid the trees at the bottom of the...  Yeah.  We had some rough stops at the end of our hill, too. 
[00:51:00]  There were kids, though, that would toboggan and sled into main roads.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  You'd have to try to stop before you zipped across a highway.  But every once in a while, you would catch that last bit of ice at the bottom.  A little rough.  You're trying to hit the curb on the street.  Yeah.  Sparks coming off your sled.  Fuck, I forgot about that.  All right.  We've got to talk about this Little League coach.  Jesus Christ.  Why?  Oh.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  He knew all the basics. 
[00:51:30]  You want to...  Where did he slip up, Uncle Paul?  He shouldn't have...  He shouldn't have kept all the videotapes where the police would find him.  Ha, ha, ha, yeah.  This guy was, uh...  I told Anthony, this guy left his house.  He was a dirty boy.  He just left his house for the last time.  He'll never see his house again.  Mm-hmm.  We're talking about a kid toucher.  He was a Little League coach.  The kids trusted him.  It's the same old fucking gag.  Yeah.  You know, when my kid gets older and if he trusts an adult, I'm going over there and 
[00:52:00]  punching him in the face because I know he's doing something.  Something's happening.  Or trying to do something.  Fuck that trusting adult shit.  Well, make sure at least the Little League coach is married.  Like, if he's married...  I don't know.  All the signs were there.  The neighbors are saying, oh, he had the house where all the kids want to hang out.  And they'd be there at night sometimes, they were saying.  Right.  And this guy, uh...  What's the story, Anthony?  So we have...  Oh, God.  He was a dirty birdie, this guy.  He was touching a bunch of kids, at least six or something? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, at least six.  What's my story?  He would have poker games over his house, and the loser of the poker game would have  to do sex acts on the other boys while he videotaped it.  Right.  And, uh...  Boy, that'll make you clinch your asshole shut when the flop comes out.  Or when you're dealt a seven-deuce offsuit.  The kid's just going like, oh, fuck.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, God.  Please, please, no king on the river. 
[00:53:00]  Please, no king on the river.  Oh, God.  What's a king on the river?  Uh, like, if a king comes out as the last card.  Why don't you want a king on the river?  What if you have two kings and you get three kings and a river?  Well, maybe...  Obviously, if you're yelling, please, no king on the river, you don't have any kings.  Oh, someone else has a king?  Someone else could have a pair of kings.  You've got a pair of aces.  And then you're sitting there going, oh, I win, I win, I win, right up to the last card.  And then a king comes out, and you're like, fuck.  Fuck.  That could be bad for me.  Damn it.  Queens Little League coach David Hartshorn. 
[00:53:30]  What?  Charged with molesting teenage boys on his team.  Oh, dear.  A sicko Little League coach once declared, of course he was, coach of the year.  All the signs.  Coach of the year.  Fucking hit the bell for all the signs, Anthony, please.  Coach of the year, bang.  Yeah, where is my little bell?  Repeatedly molested three teen boys on his team.  Prosecutors charged Wednesday.  Prosecutors said David pointed to a depraved kiddie porn film playing on his TV and told  one 13-year-old victim, I'm going to do that to you. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, my God.  This guy, how did he get such power over them?  I don't know.  It looked like this was done in the community.  What do you think it was?  Because he's got to get their trust, and he's got to have a little power.  So maybe a little booze.  Yeah, you could fly him with some Jesus juice as one pedo.  Maybe the latest video games.  Video games, always good.  Yeah.  A little poker.  A little booze, I'm thinking.  Maybe some place to hang. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Where the parents aren't going to be in the way.  That's what it was.  There's probably a lot of downtime between the kid touching where it might have been a really  cool place to be.  Just kind of hanging out.  It's like, ah, it's kind of cool to hang.  The neighbor said, ah, they would be outside running around playing, playing basketball.  Well, so the downtime must have been terrific.  This rules until I've got to suck a cock.  But he's frothing the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Because he doesn't want downtime ever.  But he knows the downtime's important to this whole situation. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, this guy couldn't take it, though.  Hartshorn, 52, once Coach of the Year.  They said that already.  Molested the boys and even filmed them having sex like he was directing a child porn.  This fucking guy's a fucking douchebag, loser.  Well, let's not judge.  He's a good coach.  Three victims were ages 13 and 14, and the attacks took place between July 2009 and late  last month.  This guy's in big trouble. 
[00:55:30]  Like I said to Anthony, he left his house for the last time.  He'll never see his house again.  What was the record?  Of what?  His ball team.  Did he do good?  He did pretty well.  Good coach?  Coach of the Year, you know?  Coach of the Year.  That means he got a few trophies.  Come on.  And, of course, the trophies probably played into this.  Oh, yeah.  The defendant is accused of taking advantage of his position as a little league baseball  coach to sexually abuse the young boys.  The consequences of his alleged actions for the victims are profound. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, boy.  This is some bad shit, boys.  In one shocking allegation, Hartshorn is accused of having six boys play a twisted game of poker  at his home on different days last August.  The loser of the card game was forced to perform a sex act on another boy.  Whoa.  As Hartshorn filmed it.  How can you think you're going to get away with that?  I told Anthony, because he broke down in court.  We discussed this for about 20 minutes before the show.  Yeah, the guy collapsed in court.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:56:30]  And I'm not feeling too well.  And I think he collapsed out of relief.  Because I was telling Anthony, if you're doing this sick shit, how do you sleep at night?  You know eventually you've got to get caught.  Because you're hoping that six kids and possibly their friends are never going to say anything.  Yeah.  So you're laying in bed every night going, oh my God, is tonight the night that I'm going to hear the fucking knock at the door?  He's probably relieved.  I don't know if that's relief or oh my God, my life has just stopped.  Because they got everything.  Oh yeah.  They got his computer, oh God, is he fucking in deep, he's in Dutch. 
[00:57:00]  He's doing six months at least.  Twisted game of poker, yeah, he filmed it.  The crimes came to light when one of the boys told his mother.  Of course.  Eventually that's what happens.  They rat out to their parents and that's it.  This type of ratting out, of course.  But when you got it, when your friend is banging the French teacher, keep it to yourself.  Yeah, don't say anything.  Keep under your hat.  Don't go tell your mommy. 
[00:57:30]  Because that was our dream growing up, wasn't it?  Yep.  This is tragic.  They reported the mobile station, blah, blah, blah.  When police, here we go, raided Hartshorn's home soon after, they found the disgusting videotapes along with a stash of child porn.  Right there for the detectives.  He appeared to faint as the charges were being presented in Queen's criminal court.  Yeah, he's in such trouble.  He fell into a court officer's arms, but prosecutors think it may have been a stunt intended to sway the judge. 
[00:58:00]  He did not require medical treatment.  This is more tragic than when lupus came out with bloody baseball pants.  The old Buttermaker was giving him the old fucking baseball bat treatment to try to get him into the game.  Buttermaker had all the signs to be a kid toucher, right?  He's giving them beer.  Oh, yeah.  They're hanging out by the pool.  He's playing with some alcohol.  They all hung out at his house, right?  Oh, yeah, that's it. 
[00:58:30]  What the fuck was that about?  Oh, old Tanner Boyle sucking dick after a poker game.  Why do you think What's-His-Name was up in that tree?  He didn't want to come down.  He didn't want to be touched anymore.  What was his name?  Hank Aaron, right?  Didn't he change his name to Hank Aaron?  Yeah, something.  Yeah.  The black kid.  What was his name in the fucking movie?  Mohammed something.  Mohammed something?  Yeah.  Neighbors said that it was routine to see a number of boys at the home, even at night.  Oh, boy.  The boys would often be playing basketball outside the home.  So the downtime, like I was talking about. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, it sounds fun until you got to, you know.  And as a kid, you're confused because you're like, oh, man, look at all the great stuff this  guy's giving us.  It's just great, but fuck.  Right?  I hate the parts where I get a weenie in my ass.  I think they were practicing poker at home before they had to go to the House of Horror.  Becoming professional.  Right.  It was Ahmad.  Ahmad, thank you.  Abdul Rahim.  Rahim, thank you.  Yeah, he was up in that tree because of Buttermaker. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  Oh, damn it.  Just fucking dealing the cards and looking and just shaking as you're looking at your  hand.  Oh, no.  Oh, please.  Right.  Well, this guy's done for.  He is in a lot of trouble.  And he'll probably get like the fuck beat out of them.  Oh, my God.  You're fucking trusted with kids.  It's like everything.  Kids and they're black kids.  Yeah.  That is not a good.  Are they black kids?  That's not a good.  It looks like it. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, it looked like it.  Just because the neighbors that were doing their interviews.  The community was being.  They were talking about how, yeah, all the kids, you know, even my kids went over there.  It was like, oh.  Yeah, it looks like it.  Oh, boy.  You got a guy that was touching black kids going to jail?  Oh, boy.  What happened with the guy that we used to know that had to go to jail for that?  He's out?  Which guy?  You know.  Oh, Perino?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It happened.  No, no.  I know.  I just make his life any worse than it already is.  Yeah.  Well, please.  Why?  You want to protect him?  No, no, no.  You're right. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Is he out?  I don't know.  I think he got out.  We lost touch with him years ago.  A couple of years ago or something?  Mm-hmm.  But he did some time.  Yeah, you're right.  What am I doing?  Allegedly, he was driving around the D.C. area, picking up inner-city children with the  promise of PlayStations and taking them back to his abode and just, wow.  I wonder if there's any trouble for that, like in jail.  Oh, I bet.  Oh, there's got to be.  Come on.  This dumb white guy. 
[01:01:00]  Dumb, tall, dorky white guy.  Inner-city utes.  What do you think happened to him in jail?  Oh, my God.  Probably was really not good.  How much time did he do?  Like five years?  Yeah.  That must have seemed like a life sentence.  It is amazing, though.  If you molest kids, how can you only do five?  Like, if you molest kids, you should just go to jail for the rest of your life.  Agreed.  I'll slow down there, Jim.  Completely agree.  You know what I mean?  It's like property crimes, armed robbery is 25 years minimum. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  I understand why a guy robs a bank.  I really, even though it's a terrible crime and, but if you rob a bank and don't kill  anybody, you're going to do 25 years anyway.  Yeah.  So you might as well kill somebody?  But if you fuck a kid.  So you might as well shoot your way out.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You might as well.  Shoot your way out.  Well, that's why they have, yeah, that's why a lot of times they do go shooting because  they know they're going for the rest of their lives.  And why would you ever look at the robber?  Fuck that.  Would you take a peek when you're on the floor?  No.  I would just look straight down at the floor. 
[01:02:00]  That's actually.  Why would you ever look?  That's always the wrong move in every fucking bank robber movie.  I would have to take a peek, though.  You would take a peek?  See if his back is turned and then just blast the back of his head out.  Well, you got a gun.  No, they already checked you for shit and you're on the floor.  Check me?  Guy ain't checking me for nothing.  I see.  They usually come in and go, on the floor.  No, no.  Most bank robberies are just some guy that goes up to the window.  No one knows the bank's being robbed until he's out. 
[01:02:30]  It's not like the movies.  Why would you be the dummy that pushes the button?  It's not my money.  I'm not moving.  You see how they robbed that bank in the town?  They just burst through the door and just start smashing faces.  That's how you got to do it.  Yeah.  But why would you be the teller that has to nervously try to go for the button?  Fuck that.  You're not paying me enough.  No, fuck that.  I'm not going for the button.  I was in an armed robbery and I did look down.  I told my girlfriend at the time, look down.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Years ago.  What happened?  I was in McDonald's many years ago in North Brunswick and the girl I was dating her name 
[01:03:00]  was Tina at the time.  I'm getting chills.  Seriously.  That just gave me fucking chills.  We're sitting facing...  This was McDonald's in North Brunswick and it faces out.  I mean, we were sitting at the counter looking out at the parking lot.  And Tina and I say, it might be nine at night.  It was late.  And I see the left.  There was two entrances.  One to the left and then the front entrance, which is to my right.  And I see three guys coming in.  Uh-oh.  Or two guys coming in wearing parkas. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Ski parkas.  And it was August.  And I immediately...  Oh, shit.  It was a problem.  So the one guy comes in.  I forget what he said, but he's got a pistol.  And the one guy comes over and he grabs me and my girlfriend.  Did he say oogily boogily?  Yes.  He's like, I love...  You got grabbed by these guys?  Yeah, but not...  How many people were in the McDonald's?  Not that many.  Maybe 12.  It was late.  But they grabbed you out of everybody?  No, no, no, no, no.  They were just trying to get everybody to the front of the store. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  They were just...  So they grabbed me and Tina.  He just corralled us.  Right, right.  But she fell getting up.  Uh-oh.  And he's like, come on, come on, come on.  And I was like, they're going to rape her in the back.  I was really scared about that.  Oh, man.  So we walk up to the front.  And I was holding a couple hundred dollars of her money.  This was like...  I mean, this is probably 1988 or 89.  That's before I did Santa.  Wow.  And I remember the one black woman ran out the front door who worked there.  And there was somebody corralling people from the front.  So we were all up at the front.  And I had my hands up.  And I was like...  I just told Tina to look down.  Don't look at him. 
[01:04:30]  Do not look at the guy.  Look at the floor.  Look at the floor.  And we could hear the guy in the back screaming,  Open the safe!  Open the safe!  He's just screaming.  And his pistol I actually saw.  I was shit in my pants.  I was nervous.  And the guy...  But the guy we were talking, who was out with us,  goes, we're not going to hurt you.  No one's going to get hurt.  But then you get scared.  They're just going to take your girlfriend.  They're going to...  It's like...  It was fucking horrifying.  Holy shit.  I never told that story?  No.  And we're just standing there looking down at the floor.  Yeah.  I remember this.  We're looking down at the floor.  It's been a bunch of years, but...  Yeah.  But that was my first instinct, was do not look at them, 
[01:05:00]  because you don't want to...  You just want to be a piece of the furniture.  Right.  If you just stand there looking down...  You don't want to make that eye contact where the guy goes,  Oh, fuck.  Now he could possibly pick me out of a lineup or something.  Fuck that.  Did you feel violated?  What do you think?  No.  I almost gave them the money in my pocket,  but they didn't rob us.  They did not rob the people.  They only robbed the store.  But did you feel...  After it was over, what happened?  I was scared when the cops came.  I didn't see anything.  I was just so scared, because a gun had been away. 
[01:05:30]  It's like, you know, again, now I would just tell them what happened.  I mean, I did tell them what happened,  but in that moment, you're in shock.  You just had a gunpoint today.  Whoa.  It's scary.  It's fucking scary.  Fuck.  Fuck.  But violated?  Hard to say, because they didn't rob me.  Like, the guy didn't...  Even the guy who...  She just happened to fall when he was corralling us up.  Yeah, he didn't rob you,  but they made you do something that you did not want to do.  They scared us a lot,  but it was a pure store robbery,  in the sense that even the guy who was out with us, 
[01:06:00]  you know, he was robbing the store,  but he wasn't abusive to us.  He wasn't shitty to us.  You know what I mean?  I knew it...  Like, there was nothing personal with us.  We were just window dressing.  Just stay here and shut the fuck up,  and everything's fine.  This has nothing to do with you.  And it didn't.  That would be great if your chick was like,  why don't you people get a job?  Great.  I would have raped her.  Great, right.  But that is what I was scared of,  is that they were going to grab her on the way out the door,  so you never know.  Yeah, let's take this.  And then the relief when they were gone? 
[01:06:30]  Tremendous relief.  But they ran right out,  but hearing that guy yell in the back,  I mean, he's going to kill that guy.  That's got to be very scary,  when you're being forced to open a safe.  Open the safe, motherfucker.  Yeah, I don't remember what he was yelling,  but he was really fucking yelling.  I would forget the combination.  Oh, dude.  It would just leave my mind.  Boy, that really is one of those things where it's like...  Don't fuck it up.  Yeah, it was very, very scary,  but again, there was three guys...  Like Hamilton trying to open the safe.  Open the fucking safe!  Lay, motherfucker!  You don't know how many had guns.  Even if I had a gun, 
[01:07:00]  I don't know if I would have pulled it,  because...  Yeah, when you got more people...  There was three guys.  That's rough.  It was like, what are you going to do?  Blast them all and risk getting other people shot?  That would have been a tough call.  Yeah, that is.  That's one of those calls where it's like,  Just stand here and...  Just be prepared,  but don't do anything.  Yeah, that's a situation where you got to roll with them.  Because there was a guy in the back  who would have been shot.  If you start hearing gunfire...  Oh, it's different.  ...then you got to start, you know,  self-preservation mode.  But yeah, you can't endanger...  There's not...  A situation...  If you're legally allowed to carry a gun concealed, 
[01:07:30]  it doesn't mean every time something happens  you pull it out and start fucking shooting,  because you could definitely fuck the situation up.  Well, you can get yourself killed  because there was a guy behind us  and the guy...  It was like...  It was just...  They weren't all in your sight line.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what was...  They were literally...  Those guys were just watching the doors.  They just wanted...  They wanted to get out of there, too.  Right.  Wow.  How long did it take for the cops to show up after?  A couple of minutes.  I mean, the North Brunswick Police Department  was literally a half mile down the street. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  Those guys are probably from New Brunswick,  from the projects,  or from Franklin,  which was not that far.  Were they African-American gentlemen?  They're black guys.  Yeah, they definitely were.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, but that's...  I didn't say that when they were rock...  I thought I said they would run in.  There were three black guys.  Did they ever catch them?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I mean, that's so many years ago.  I don't know.  Wow.  That's fucking harrowing.  Yeah.  That was fucking scary.  All right, here we go.  Brendan in South Carolina.  Brendan.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Good morning. 
[01:08:30]  Good.  Similar story to Jimmy.  I was actually...  My first deal job  and walked into a bank.  I hadn't made a deposit  because I was barfending on the weekends  to get some extra cash.  I probably had, I don't know,  $1,500, $2,000,  and was making a deposit into the bank  and, you know,  kind of chatting up the teller  and had an, you know,  kind of elbow leaning up on the counter,  looked left,  and saw this guy walking into the bank.  And I was like,  wow, he's dressed possibly warm for July.  And he dropped the door open  with a little,  a little footstep thing  and walked right in with a ski mask, 
[01:09:00]  handed a note right over the counter  with gloves on.  I realized what's happening  and kind of put my hands  right on the counter  where I could see.  He was a little bit shorter than I.  He showed the butt of his gun  in his waistband  and, you know,  30 seconds later,  he was walking out of the bank  with a bag full of cash.  Yeah, that's the best way to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Just fucking, you know,  don't get involved with it.  I don't know.  Especially if they're fucking...  You're going to get yourself killed.  Most times, I'm assuming,  I'm sure there's those sociopaths  who want to hurt somebody. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  But I really think most people  just doing a store robbery like that  with a lot of people in it  or a bank  just want to get the fuck out.  It's also the late night ones  where a store's closing up  and the employees are there.  That's a dangerous situation  because a lot of times  they're just like,  well, all we got to do  is kill these motherfuckers  and no witnesses.  More importantly,  did you get to eat your Happy Meal?  I don't remember.  I said,  don't take my McNuggets.  You black son of a bitch.  I really white-guided up on him.  Or you just throw a McNugget 
[01:10:00]  at the back of his head.  Here, eat this, chicken lover.  Things you can do  that will get you shot.  Oh, wow.  Let's say hi to Scrambler in Chicago.  Scrambler.  Scrambler.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Yesterday, my uncle was,  two gentlemen rang his doorbell  dressed in snowmobile gear.  You know, the coats, the bibs,  and ski masks.  I asked if he had any gas  or snowmobile ran out.  Oh, yeah.  You tweeted this last night, right? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I read that one.  And I talked to him.  He called me before surgery.  I talked to him real quick,  and I talked to him right after  he got out of surgery yesterday.  And so he said, you know,  the shed's over there.  Help yourself with some gas.  And then one was black,  one was white.  He could tell through the mats.  And so then they rang the doorbell  a little bit later,  and they got into,  I don't know what happened,  the lead to the tussle,  but he said he, you know,  kind of got into it with one of them  because he knew that something 
[01:11:00]  was going to happen.  And then he got, like, you know,  one of them hit him over the head  with the gun,  and they shot him,  and one shot at each of his inner thighs.  And they missed everything,  no arteries or anything.  One went in and out,  and the other one was lodged in.  And so he had to go to surgery.  You know, obviously, when they left,  he called 911,  crawled upstairs, grabbed his .380,  crawled back downstairs  and waited for the, you know,  the police to get there. 
[01:11:30]  And he was, four hours later,  he came out of surgery  and talking to me on the phone.  He wasn't, it seemed like he was all right  for a guy who just got shot twice,  you know?  Jesus Christ.  That does make Anthony look less nuts  for having his gun on him, though,  because your uncle had a gun.  I mean, it's like,  you do have to have it on you, I guess,  because people don't wait for you  to run upstairs.  I don't answer the door without one.  Like, if I see somebody knocking on my door  and stuff, I'm like,  who the fuck is this?  All right.  But then I just,  I smile and open the door.  Hi, how are you?  Ooh, what do you need? 
[01:12:00]  What do you want?  I do that, too.  I make, you know,  if somebody's coming,  like a service guy or something,  I always make sure I got it on the hip  and, you know, I open it,  you know,  and that's the first thing they see.  Yep.  You don't talk about it,  but you make sure that  the first thing they see  is the, you know,  the grips hanging out of your waistband  or sticking out of your holster  and, you know.  Yeah, just let them know  no shenanigans.  See, what you ought to do  is you got to be subtle about it.  You go, hi, sorry for the delay. 
[01:12:30]  I was just buffing my bullets.  Buffing your bullets.  Yes, whatever it is done,  people do.  I don't know.  Do you ever buff bullets?  I was washing my gun.  I was washing the bullets.  You don't wash your gun.  No.  No, no, no.  How about you say,  sorry, I had my bullets on tumble dry.  I was removing them  and putting them in my gun.  Well, we're glad he's doing well there, sir.  Wow, that's a, well.  That's a hell of a story you got, Scramble.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:13:00]  People are just brazen.  Brazen.  There's home invasions.  Wisconsin, the only other state  besides Illinois  that doesn't have a legal carry law.  They do have a loophole  where you can open carry,  but you can't have it on you  in your car  or in a restaurant.  So it's kind of worthless.  But it is the only other state  besides Illinois.  No concealed carry law.  Wow.  All right.  That's something.  There you go.  Damn.  All right, sir.  Have a good morning, boys.  Goodbye, mister.  Let's go to Nate in Delaware. 
[01:13:30]  Nate.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning, Nate.  When I was in college,  I got a phone call  and I got a call from my dad  saying my mom was robbed at gunpoint  while manning their car lives,  a family-owned business.  She was 40,  nine months pregnant,  and the black gentleman,  he came in,  showed her the gun,  asked her to get on her knees,  tied her up,  and my mom just said,  please don't kill me.  I'm pregnant.  And he said,  I'm not going to hurt you, ma'am. 
[01:14:00]  He stole a car,  $100 in cash,  dumped the car  about five miles down the road,  and they never found him.  Your mom got very lucky.  Wow.  When you said he pulled her on her knees,  I was like,  this story's about to get great.  It's like, oh, great.  Oh, shit.  She laughs about it now.  You know,  she tells the story  and she had no fear.  It was just,  it was amazing.  God.  Probably look at life differently, right?  I bet she thought she was getting  fucking back of the head.  Let's say hi to Robert in Wisconsin. 
[01:14:30]  Robert.  Hey there, Bab.  A couple more of these,  and we'll move on.  What's up, Robert?  Hey, what's up, guys?  When I was 19,  I was a manager at Wendy's,  and two guys came in with shotguns  with steam ass on.  I thought it was just my friends  fucking with me,  so I kept pushing the shotgun away.  Until they smashed me in the face.  Oh, God.  Yeah, and then I was like,  oh, fuck, this is real.  And then they took me back,  and I'm trying to open the safe  while there's fucking blood  coming down my face and shit.  I'm like, oh, man,  I was all fucked up.  Why would you assume it's your friend?  Exactly.  You never...  Oh, you silly gooses. 
[01:15:00]  I just,  I didn't think it was real.  I was just too young and stupid.  I was just like,  I don't know.  It just didn't seem real to me.  It would be a great prank  to pull on your friends  if you knew no one else was around, but...  Yeah, exactly.  But fuck.  The cop comes in  and blows your head off  because you're standing there  with a gun.  Wow.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Charlie  in Staten Island.  He's retired NYPD.  What's up, Charlie?  Charlie.  Yeah, OB,  on the silent alarm,  they got a delay on the button. 
[01:15:30]  It's like three or five minutes,  so that gives the time  for the robber to get out  so there's no hostages.  Hostages taken.  Wow.  Look at that.  Do they really do that?  Yeah, there's a delay.  That's a long five minutes  for everybody.  I know.  What if they're abusing people  and hurting them?  I don't know,  but I guess they don't want  a hostage situation,  kind of like dog day afternoon.  Dog day afternoon, right.  Okay.  That makes sense.  Logically, I guess it makes sense  unless you're in that situation  because you would hope  someone comes immediately  if you push that button.  Yeah, you need help immediately. 
[01:16:00]  But why...  Charlie, I got to call you out on this.  Okay.  All right, so there's a delay  because they don't want  a hostage situation,  but why wouldn't there be no delay  but the NYPD allows five minutes?  Oh.  You know what I mean?  So you know exactly  when the button was pushed.  No, it goes through the system somehow.  When they push the button,  it goes automatically,  but the delay is on NYPD's end,  the dispatch end of it.  Oh.  Boy, that seems like 
[01:16:30]  it could be a lawsuit.  Yeah, I think that they probably  wait out.  I think they wait five minutes  before they enter the bank  because you could probably walk outside  and the cops are waiting for you.  I don't see a five-minute delay.  What if they're murdering people?  What if they're in there  spray-painting graffiti  or whatever they do?  Guy who just goes off point.  I don't know why they do it,  but I know that it's...  What if they're in there  turning the chairs upside down  and throwing the pens all over?  Then what happens?  And ripping the calendars up?  Putting the deposit slips 
[01:17:00]  where the withdrawal slips go.  Yeah, what if they're doing  that using all the ink  and the pens?  Then what do we do?  Go ahead, your turn.  See you later.  All right, Charlie.  He's had it with us.  Oh, a little beep, beep, beep.  But don't be the person  trying to push the button.  No.  Don't do that.  No heroes.  No heroes,  because the company  doesn't care in the end.  They're not going to give you  a big fucking bonus  if you survived  the bank robbery  and save them money.  I would be a hero  and I would stand up  and I would tell them, 
[01:17:30]  I'm not standing for this  and I would point at the table.  I'm a hero.  You think that would cause problems?  For my teeth, yes.  One fucking gun butt  to the gums.  That must have been something  just seeing  young Jimmy Norton  with his head down.  Don't look.  Don't look at him.  Don't look at him.  Were you able to communicate  anything to your chick  while this was going on?  Yeah, you were standing.  I just said,  just look down.  Do not look up at them.  Don't look.  What'd you say, motherfucker?  I said,  what'd you say?  I said,  what do we expect 
[01:18:00]  from you people?  This is what we expect.  This is why gentrification.  It was on a long  45-minute discussion  about gentrification.  It's a debate.  I'm not going to debate you, Jimmy.  This isn't a debate.  What's that from?  Fargo.  We got Macy coming in next week.  I can't wait.  We're shameless.  What day?  Great show on Showtime, right?  Yeah.  What day?  I think it's the 18th. 
[01:18:30]  You're darn tootin'.  A week from tomorrow.  He'll be in.  We're pretty busy,  but that's the way we like it.  You better want to talk  about Fargo as well.  Oh, yeah.  You better.  You better.  One more robbery story  or you want to take  a little break?  Boogie Nights.  Do we have an Oscar  moment today?  We have Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  We can.  We can have one.  I know there's one ready to do.  Is it this one or a new one?  Let me see.  Let me see what that is.  Well, there's the Inception one.  No, no, no.  There's a new Oscar moment?  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  You got that?  You should have it.  I can swear that it was  on discs for you.  Let me see.  I got Carl from  An Idiot Abroad.  This is the Inception one.  I love how we do  the house cleaning  right in front of everyone.  I don't know.  When we come back,  we should discuss Al Roker.  Oh, yeah.  Here's the Oscar moment.  King's Speech.  Oh, what's the guy's name 
[01:19:30]  who did that?  The actor?  Colin Firth.  Oh, Colin Firth?  I don't like him.  I like Colin Second.  Oh.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony Show  proudly presents  Oscar Moments.

[01:21:30]  we don't know how to say  his last name.  Or?  Yeah.  Silent H?  No, or.  Right, Travis?  O-H.  Yeah, I thought that or.  Michael or who?  Michael R.  Michael or.  Michael or who?  The book actually looks good.  I'm looking through his book.  I'm sick.  Fuck.  No, you're okay.  Okay, good.  His book looks actually very good.  Is it called The Catch?  No.  No, he has a real story.  It's I beat the odds.  He was from homelessness  to the blind side.  Yeah, but  didn't, um,  they kind of make that movie? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, but it's kind of  from his point of view.  Wasn't the movie  kind of from his point of view, too?  I don't know.  They threw a little too much  Hollywood in there.  But I have to say  this is going to be  the real story.  Oh, yeah?  The photos are pretty close  to the characters.  Like, Kathy Bale.  Like, they really did stay true  to what the people  really looked like.  It's like, you think  that they just hotted it up  but then you look  at the real mom  and it's like, yeah,  she's a good looking woman.  Maybe that's our angle.  What wasn't real about the film?  What wasn't real?  What wasn't real?  Yeah.  Tell us what wasn't real. 
[01:22:30]  Uh, fucking Guitar Hero.  Sorry to hear.  What?  Well, it's about time.  What?  That kind of ran its course.  Did it?  Yeah, they're discontinuing it.  No more Guitar Hero.  No.  I always thought the game was lame.  I've got to be honest with you.  No, it was huge for a while.  I didn't like it.  I never got into it.  I was never good at it.  I sucked at it.  Maybe that's why  I think it's lame.  Yeah.  I wasn't a big fan.  I mean, you remember the time  our own Danny took on, um...  Oh, boy.  Who did he take on? 
[01:23:00]  One of our...  Intern Evan.  Intern Evan.  The old Evan.  Remember Evan?  Yeah, Evan.  Who was...  Swivel hips.  Evan, who was good at everything  except walking.  And, uh, Evan, yeah,  Evan beat his ass.  Old bitch hips.  Remember him?  You know how much time  you got for video games  if you don't walk properly?  Of course he's good at video games.  That's true.  He can't walk.  Right?  Yeah.  Speaking of handicaps,  just real quick,  I see blind people  in New York City. 
[01:23:30]  You know I haven't,  motherfuckers.  Ah, shit.  It should just end there  because what I have to say  will not be able  to compete with that  to see blind people.  It's just a quick observation.  I don't know how they do it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You see them at crosswalks.  And all of a sudden,  all of a sudden,  they'll be at a crosswalk  and you hear them go,  help anyone around?  Are you kidding? 
[01:24:00]  No, man,  which means they are shut out.  There's nothing going on.  And they're just trusting  a complete stranger  to get them across the street.  Yeah, come right this way.  I'm going to help you  across the street.  I was thinking,  the balls it takes  to live in Manhattan  if you're blind  and walking around,  it just amazed me.  But they don't have any clue  that Manhattan's crazy like that.  They probably think it's like...  How do you get to your house?  That's what I'm getting at.  But you can't look  at the big buildings.  You probably just think, 
[01:24:30]  oh, this is like a little town.  When my alarm goes off,  I'm blind for about five minutes  because I try to navigate  around my house a little bit  so I don't wake anybody.  Yeah, in the dark.  Yeah, but I'm thinking,  okay, after a while  you would get used to your house  and where everything is  if you're blind.  But how do you do that  with a city?  Dude, they take the subway.  It's fucking amazing.  They take the subway,  they get out,  now they have to assume  they're not walking  in the middle of traffic  and then they get to the crosswalk  and then they have to ask for help.  Oh, God, being blind.  People who are both, 
[01:25:00]  or I've heard of people who,  like, they say being blind  is better than being deaf.  I don't see how that is.  They said being blind  is better than being deaf.  What?  They said being blind  is better than being deaf.  What?  Because they said you get shut out.  Fuck that.  I don't know, man,  but I think blind or deaf.  I would have to always be able to see.  Oh, God, I got to see.  My relationship would be better  if I was deaf.  Simple.  Movies.  Movies.  You can't hear them.  Who cares?  You can read still.  Oh, right, yeah.  Yeah, they got those special things. 
[01:25:30]  There's no way being deaf  is worse than being blind.  No fucking way.  What?  There's no way.  Who's saying he doesn't know  if being deaf is worse than being blind?  Give me some research on that.  There's no way.  Oh, fall for the same gag, Jim.  How did Helen Keller fucking,  she was blind, deaf, and dumb.  How do you ever connect with people?  It's just to be trapped in that fucking...  Just keep your asshole open.  Oh, that's all she's got to do.  Gape.  Just a little gaping.  Yeah, Helen was a three-holer. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, that would just be so fucked up.  No, you mean blind and deaf?  Completely shut up.  And then achieving what she achieved in life?  What?  What did she do?  Oh, she did all kinds of things.  Oh, good for her.  No, she didn't.  She learned to read.  Who gives a turkey?  I can read.  And sign language.  And what did that lead to?  Exactly.  Did it lead to a good job on Wall Street?  Exactly.  Did she sell out the fucking Fox Foods  on April 30th,  going on sale tomorrow morning?  Fuck Helen Keller.  I'll kick that blind bitch right in her stomach. 
[01:26:30]  Helen Keller.  The nerve of her.  Bitch couldn't sell ticket one.  Oh, boy.  Now I got the blind people  and the deaf people calling in.  Well, we told the deaf people  what we were talking about.  I'll fucking smash them, rats.  But no, I'm interested  into what's harder, man.  They both seem like such...  You want to talk to a deaf person?  Yeah.  Let's have them argue.  See what the fuck...  See what's more difficult.  John, deaf person.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello? 
[01:27:00]  I had a feeling  this was not going to go well.  It's so hack.  It's funny, though.  But Timmy actually said, yeah.  Deaf person.  Oh, shit.  Oh, is that just so stupid?  Jimmy. 
[01:27:30]  Jimmy, you actually said, yeah.  I did.  All right.  Susan in Jersey.  Susan, both your parents are deaf.  That's right.  How does that work out for you?  Well, you know,  it was tough growing up,  but I made it.  I'm doing just fine.  Why is it tough for you?  Exactly.  You never hear keep it down.  Right.  Play your music all loud.  You rock music and bad mouth  in your country, I bet.  Sorry.  You're a teenager.  You're playing with your clit.  You can fucking moan as long as you want.  Oh, God.  That's true.  That's right.  To be with that blind and deaf, 
[01:28:00]  you can get fucked right in the living room  while they're sitting there not watching TV.  See, they're looking at an upside-down television.  Might have a sense of smell, though.  Oh, geez.  Chlorine?  Yeah, exactly.  Is there a pool in the house?  Yeah, they'll think somebody spilled chlorine  on a catfish.  Who's cleaning the fishery?  Who's cleaning the fish tank out with chlorine?  I hope you weren't looking for sympathy, Susan.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, Susan.  You want to share with us  and we're going with these awful jokes.  I apologize.  I just wanted to say...  Why was it...  You know what? 
[01:28:30]  We'll get some real shit out.  Why was it tough?  Why was it tough?  Because I had to translate for them all the time.  You know, they needed phone calls,  that kind of stuff.  Oh, wow.  By the time you were, like, a person  that could do shit,  they had it figured out by then, right?  No, they still...  To this day, I mean, they're pretty elderly  and they still call on me to help them.  So it's tough for them.  But listen, I've adjusted.  How do they call?  Smoke signals?  Yeah.  I love your bit about the ashtray ears and all that. 
[01:29:00]  I always...  Oh, okay.  Old ashtray ears.  We just assume we're talking to people...  Kathy-ish.  We just assume we're talking to people  that don't know any deaf people  when we do those jokes.  We forget that maybe it hits...  It's a little too close to home for some.  You think that hurt our fucking...  When we were in Chicago,  talking about fucking that bitch  and her stupid fucking...  Those worthless glasses holders on her head.  Oh, God.  Oh, the one they put on TV  that couldn't hear.  Cameron something.  Yeah.  I lived next door to a deaf family. 
[01:29:30]  It was like the mother, father,  and the daughter was...  Could they not hear,  or were they black and cool?  And they fucked up the neighborhood  with the sign, right?  No.  The sign.  They didn't have to tell you  that deaf people are...  Nah, they didn't give a shit  about a sign or anything.  I don't hear you, Jimmy.  I'm sure it was fucking terrific.  What was fucked up was...  It was mediocre.  Okay.  What was fucked up  was the yelling.  They would start yelling at each other.  About what?  And you'd hear like...  Just make believe 
[01:30:00]  you're watching Jurassic Park.  Yeah.  It was really fucked up.  Why is young Frankenstein  belting out a song in the...  Right.  Whatever.  Deaf parents, though.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, you know,  there's worse things in life, but...  I would have taken that  over an emotionally abusive mom,  but, you know,  we all have our burdens.  Yeah.  That's right.  So, anyway,  I just wanted you to know  that they always said  rather be deaf than blind 
[01:30:30]  because they can watch movies,  they can drive.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay, you know what?  Yeah, Jimmy,  what are you talking about?  But then again,  they were deaf,  so they didn't...  They've adapted to that.  Blind people might say  something different, though.  Is there really anything  out there worth listening to?  Well, I don't know.  Think about it.  You guys.  Visually,  visually is way better.  Yeah, definitely.  And we make our living  off fucking talking  and hoping  that you're hearing this,  but I think visually  is way better.  Maybe you're right. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Anyway, guys,  thanks for everything.  Goodbye.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Goodbye.  Thanks for nothing.  Bye.  Thanks for bumming us out.  Really.  God.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Take care.  You're a bummer.  Exactly.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike,  no headphones having,  motherfucker.  Hey,  I taught special needs kids  for two years  and I had a deaf kid  and a blind kid  in my class.  It was way tougher  to be blind.  Right.  He'd walk in the walls  all the time.  My first real...  Sounds like a bad boy.  My first real girlfriend, 
[01:31:30]  Christine,  she lives in a...  Well, I don't want  to tell people  where she lives  because she's not on Facebook.  I want to see  what she looks like these days.  It's been many, many years.  She's a saint on earth  because she taught  like summer camp  for these kids  and I'm not talking  about the ones  that are a little bit funny.  these kids were all  all the way in funny.  Meaning...  Ballin'.  Meaning,  I don't even think  they knew they were alive.  That's how bad  these kids were.  And this girlfriend of mine  from the past, 
[01:32:00]  a fucking saint,  she worked at this camp  and trying to make  their lives a little better.  And I went to visit her  and they're playing kickball.  I told this story  many times  with the wheelchairs  and stuff,  but the kids have  no fucking idea  where they even are.  You know,  if you're a little funny  and you're playing kickball,  you see it in their faces  like,  oh wow,  I'm enjoying my life  and what my life is.  Yeah.  But these kids  were so gone  that they were the,  you know,  the state owned them  and all that crap.  Like,  they didn't have families 
[01:32:30]  or nothing  because they were just  giving up on it.  I mean,  which is really sad.  And I'm like,  what kind of person  does it take  to actually,  you know,  try to make their lives  a little better?  Yeah.  When you look at them  and go,  there's no one  home.  Not even a glimmer  in the eyes.  Nothing.  I don't know how  that's even dealt with.  Sorry,  Mike,  but what were you saying?  That's all right.  I was just saying,  it's a lot tougher  to be blind.  And look at someone  like Matt Hamill,  the UFC guy.  There's no way  you put a deaf guy,  I mean,  a blind guy, 
[01:33:00]  in the octagon  and expect him  to do anything  but,  you know,  get his head knocked off.  Yeah.  What do you want,  a trophy?  No,  he's right,  I mean,  that is groundbreaking.  Blind guys can't fight  as good as guys  with eyes.  I've done a lot  of research  into that.  Thank you.  Thanks, Doc.  Mike,  thank you, man.  You want any more  of these?  Grandfather's  blind and deaf.  Oh,  fuck yeah.  Jared. 
[01:33:30]  What would you get him  for Christmas?  A coffee mug  that's the world's  greatest burden?  Oh,  shit.  I'm sorry,  I don't mean that.  Yeah,  my girlfriend's father  is blind and deaf.  Oh,  girlfriend.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Oh,  girlfriend's father.  Wait,  girlfriend's father  blind and deaf,  deaf,  excuse me,  so how did he get pussy?  Oh.  I have no idea. 
[01:34:00]  Sense of smell?  Yeah,  yeah.  And touch.  In order to  communicate with him,  you've got to do  sign language in his  hands,  and I can honestly  say I haven't had  a 30-second conversation  with the guy  in a year.  Of course you haven't.  Wait,  you've got to hold  his hand and do  the signs in the  palm of his hand?  Yeah.  Like Helen Keller?  What a nightmare.  I haven't gotten  that close to him yet,  so,  you know.  So,  have you been  around him a lot?  Enough.  So,  what does he do  for enjoyment? 
[01:34:30]  You know what I mean?  He does watch TV,  like,  he's not completely  blind,  but,  like,  his peripheral vision  is completely gone,  so it's like he's  looking through a tube  and it's still  not that far,  but,  believe it or not,  he's actually  an architect.  Oh.  An architect.  Yeah.  I wish I had  my thing up.  A little too late.  Such a burden,  these things. 
[01:35:00]  I really wish we...  Has anyone ever  used his designs?  We could get better.  Supposedly.  Really?  That would be  a mess of a...  Who,  Dr. Seuss?  No.  Ah,  there we go.  Yeah.  Ah.  He's blind.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Why was he driving?  I got an email  communique.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:35:30]  Here's the title of it.  Hey, Jared,  thank you.  Thanks, Jared.  How High Highness  out-tipped LeBron James  last night.  I guess he meant  his highness,  but his highness  apparently out-tipped  LeBron James  in a restaurant.  His highness is an ass.  Can we get him on?  It's been way too long.  I got that same email  yesterday.  So Ian's big scoop  is that he tipped  more than LeBron James  did at the same restaurant.  Hey, man,  the show's going to get  busy with guests.  Can we get him on? 
[01:36:00]  We've got to get Ian on.  Yeah,  I'll shoot him an email.  He out-tipped  LeBron James last night?  No,  it wasn't even  on the same night.  Right,  he said the waitress  told him  that LeBron had tipped  $3 after eating a lot  and his highness  left a $13 tip.  LeBron left $3.  But here's the headline  on his website.  IUC world exclusive.  His highness  versus the king.  How I out-tipped  LeBron James last night  by more than quadruple. 
[01:36:30]  That's a headline.  That means he tipped  $12 to $15.  $13, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  And that's his story.  I love Ian.  Wow.  I'm a huge fan of Ian.  I used to hate him.  He's one of those guys,  you put him on the radio,  people either love him  or hate him.  Yeah,  I used to totally be on that.  I just can't stand him.  Really?  Now I'm definitely all in.  I'm all in.  So Jews tip  better than black people  with a 4 to 1 margin.  Is that what we're saying?  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:37:00]  Look at Glory all red.  She's so fucking hateable.  What is she doing now?  She's representing  a former Bronx teacher  who I guess  used to be a whore  or something  and got fired.  Yeah, I might agree  with that one.  She used to be a whore.  I might agree with Gloria.  Yeah, you know,  who cares?  She was a whore.  Fiance is a teacher  for the deaf  and says deaf  is worse than blind.  No, I'd like to hear that.  Well, it depends  on what you do for a living.  Right.  I think overall, though,  most people would  want to be deaf 
[01:37:30]  over blind.  Why do you think  that they're saying  that deaf is worse  than blind?  Do you think  they're just sick and tired  of the iPod boxes  stacking up?  They don't know  what they are?  Usually,  they're just doorstops  and paperweights.  What are these circles for?  Joe in Arizona.  Joe?  Yeah, it was fun, guys.  Hey, Joe.  Anytime that question  was proposed  to say it was easy  to be deaf,  but when I met  my fiance and she  would tell me  what these kids  would go through,  it just seems  so much worse for them  because a lot of the time  their families  don't even follow  their language,  so they're so isolated 
[01:38:00]  from their families.  They don't even get  the concept  that they have  brothers and sisters  and things like that  and every time  the family's over  and having conversations,  they're just kind of  sitting in the corner  like the dog  and have no idea  what they're doing.  Anytime they have to  go to the doctor,  you know,  they need a translator  there with them.  Like, everything  just seems a little  rougher for them.  Maybe it's easier  to get to be an adult,  but for kids,  I think being deaf  is worse  because that language  development is so much  harder.  Well, Al Capone's kid  I think was deaf  and he thought  he was retarded 
[01:38:30]  where something  was wrong with him.  Really?  Yeah.  I learned that from  Warwick Empire.  Oh.  That's true.  I believe it is.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Beth.  One more story  and then I think  we got his highness  on the line.  Beth.  Beth, I hear you calling.  Oh, don't say here.  No, Beth,  I don't hear you calling.  Beth, I see the phone ringing  and I hear nothing  but static  because I'm deaf.  Beth?  Like, I haven't heard  that one before. 
[01:39:00]  Haven't heard?  What's that, Beth?  Not that I haven't heard  that one before.  I heard you.  You're all right already.  Go ahead, Beth.  Sorry.  That's okay.  My dad lost his sight  a couple years ago  to a brain tumor  and he went out  to go get his mail  and he got attacked  by a rabid raccoon.  The raccoon  knocked him down.  My stepmother  was putting up  the Christmas tree  and had to beat it off  with an electrical cord.  Jesus.  What else did the tumor  take his muscles?  Yeah, pretty much. 
[01:39:30]  He actually snapped  a tendon in his hand  when he fell, too.  Why would he get...  He probably stepped on it,  didn't attack him,  was probably defending himself.  He thought it was  the mailbox.  He opened his mouth  and shoved his hand in there  looking for a letter.  Yeah.  It went after his slippers.  He had on fur slippers.  Oh, that's great.  They thought that he was  assaulting two animals.  I guess so.  He starts cracking  his wife's feet.  They thought he was a god  being carried  by two animals.  Who is this god  taking these letters 
[01:40:00]  out of the mailbox?  It was just...  I had to share it  with you guys.  It was just too...  But why is he going  to get something  that's useless to him?  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.  Mail.  Like the mail.  I don't know.  He was trying  to be helpful, I guess.  Yeah, tell him  he's not being helpful.  Tell him to just sit there.  Being helpful...  Sit him in a garage  just to the paint thinner.  Right, being helpful  would be...  Oh, fuck.  All right.  I've checked it out.  I had a noose joke,  but...  I knocked it out.  For the tennis shot.  I mean, for the baby shot.  You know what you ought to do  is just throw a blanket  over him when company  comes over.  See, the fact that you're 
[01:40:30]  just staring at everything  bothers us.  Well, we had to buy him  a raccoon hat for Christmas  just for giggles.  He didn't know.  That's funny.  He freaked out  and started hitting it.  He has no idea.  He's beating his own head in.  Walks into the tree  all clumsy.  Knocking his shit over.  That's a man-hat.  Knocking down mailboxes.  Getting attacked  by rabid raccoons.  Had a brain tumor, too.  Is he okay now?  Do you guys ever  fuck with his blindness?  No, he had one twice.  So what started to come back  in the sight, 
[01:41:00]  he lost a second time.  Oh, wow.  That stinks.  Oh, man.  Do you fuck up?  He still goes to the gym.  He spins, you know,  like four times a week.  Well, he has no worries.  He has no worries  where the door is.  He's looking for it.  Why would he say he spins?  How did he get to the gym?  His wife takes him.  Okay.  I'd play a joke on him.  I'd put him on a real bicycle.  Watch him hit the wall.  Like Rodney in Easy Money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Spinning class.  Go ahead.  Pedal real fast. 
[01:41:30]  You hold the back of the bike up  and then just drop it.  Or take the seat off.  Oh, my God.  Do you ever fuck with his blindness?  Did I ever what?  Do you guys fuck with his blindness?  Because, you know...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We give him food he doesn't like  and we move shit  that he doesn't know his moves.  That's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Do you ever move the toilet?  No, I have not moved the toilet.  So he's dropping a deuce on the floor?  Well, just pull the old cellophane  over the toilet gag 
[01:42:00]  and then he sits down  and take a dump  and just smush  between his ass and the cellophane.  You'll just find him collapsed  and weeping on the floor.  Shit on his ass.  We have left the seat up, though,  so he has fallen in.  So we have done that.  Yeah.  That's funny.  The cellophane.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Goodbye.  We got Ian in the...  He's catching a flight in a few minutes.  Okay.  Ian Halperin,  congratulations on your big exclusive search.  Jim Norton just let us in on it there.  Hey, first of all,  to you guys,  it's His Highness, 
[01:42:30]  and I'll tell you one thing.  I make King LeBron look like  just regular people now,  and I always said this, you know,  when you're with people  to become truly great,  one has to stand with the people,  not above them.  But LeBron James,  he stands below them  because this guy's a cheapskate, man.  Yeah?  He makes Jews look, you know,  like Menchus, this guy.  Oh.  He goes into a restaurant in South Beach.  It's called the Big Pink.  Have you heard of that joint?  No, the Big Pink? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  I've never been there.  It's a trendy diner.  Uh-huh.  I might have actually been there.  Wait a minute.  I was probably drunk.  I think I was there, though,  because I remember going to  a trendy diner down there.  They have about 400 things  on the menu there.  It's a spectacular menu.  It's open until 3 in the morning.  Yep, I was there.  I went to the Heat game  the other night against Indiana,  and they should have blown out the Heat.  They were winning by something like  13, 14 points entering the fourth quarter, 
[01:43:30]  and then they just collapsed.  I mean, I would have fired the coach  just based on that performance.  You don't lose a game when you're up 13.  I don't care if you're playing  Will Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Dr. J,  and, you know...  Way to keep it current.  ...together.  I know.  So, his...  I hate to mix up the sports.  So, his highness,  I've got to ask you, though.  I've got the number one  fucking show in the world, man.  That's my next exclusive.  Ah.  My barometer for success 
[01:44:00]  is anyone who lasts  more than 10 years.  You've passed the test,  and I firmly congratulate you.  Thank you, sir.  Passed that a few years ago already.  I want to ask you, though,  about this tipping thing,  which is a big story.  How did you find out  that he was a skinflint?  All right.  I go in after the game.  I go to the Big Pink.  Right.  And I'm with these two people  from Chicago.  One of them's a really smoking,  hot chick.  Boobs.  Of course.  Just sticking right out. 
[01:44:30]  And then a friend of mine  from South Beach.  He's a real estate agent.  So, we all go in  and start talking up the waitress  because she was smoking hot, man.  The first thing I noticed  is, you know,  the panties sticking out a bit  when she bends down.  And, man, you know,  I just wanted to give it to her  right then and there,  right from behind.  You would have loved her, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Really hot blonde from Louisiana  working in South Beach.  Ah.  We go in and start talking her up 
[01:45:00]  and then she tells me  LeBron was in here the other night  and she starts bitching, man.  She says the guy had no class.  He ate like a tiger.  He only left a three-buck tip,  she said.  You know,  and on a very expensive bill.  What's a very expensive bill?  I've got to slow you down.  Like, a few hundred dollars?  Mine was $65.51  because when His Highness goes out,  he picks up the tab for everyone.  It's not an expensive place.  I left $13 on $65.51.  He should have used  his tip calculator. 
[01:45:30]  I've got to make Jews look good  because, yeah,  I do conceive.  Then kill yourself.  I just want to be Jew  in the world, Madonna.  She's a fucking cheapskate, man.  I used to date her cook  and, you know,  the cook told me,  who was in your studio once,  she said she's the biggest,  and she said that on your show,  she's a motherfucking cheapskate,  you know.  So she wears the Kabbalah,  you know,  but she takes it  to another extreme.  And Bill Cosby's  a notorious cheapskate.  You know,  Gwyneth Paltrow,  apparently she uses the excuse 
[01:46:00]  she can't calculate  what 15 or 18%  of the bill is.  Really?  So she's way under.  So tell her to do 10% twice.  Right.  Yeah, exactly, man.  Just leave 20%  and then take away a buck  if you're uncomfortable  leaving 20%.  I know that, you know,  when Anthony goes out,  right, what do you leave Anthony?  I always leave  at least 20%.  It's just easier  to calculate that way.  You take the bill,  you move the decimal  over one,  and you double it,  and that's what you  fucking do. 
[01:46:30]  That's it.  That's right.  I always leave 20%  plus my phone number  if the chick's out.  I did give him a call.  Oh, you.  Oh, shit, Ian.  She has since called.  She has since called.  I'm hoping to give it to her  right from behind tonight, dude.  She is smoking hot.  But anyhow,  she was venting.  Something tells me  your tip would be  smaller than LeBron's  in that situation.  No, I think my tip's  bigger than LeBron's.  Seriously.  You know,  apparently his schlong,  you know,  ain't too pretty.  But...  How'd you find that out? 
[01:47:00]  You know what I'm saying here?  Did that bum you out?  She said his bill  was significantly  higher than mine.  Ah.  Well, so you're  busting apart  the stereotype  that black people  tip a lot?  Is that what you're  doing?  He's called  Scotty Pippen,  you know.  Yeah.  No tippin' pippin'.  No tippin' pippin'?  Is that what they  called him?  That's what his nickname  is.  Ah.  See, all these guys  go out  and they think  it's carte blanche.  Ah.  Another guy's  Ozzy Guillen, 
[01:47:30]  the manager of the  White Sox.  He'll go out  and he'll just  disappear.  I thought they  couldn't calculate  the tip,  so they said,  I can't figure...  Well, you know.  There you go.  They just go out.  What are we going  to do about LeBron?  Is somebody going  to show up and,  you know...  Well, you did it,  man.  You got the world  exclusive.  Yes.  I'm sure the  mainstream media  is going to be  all over this  within the hour. 
[01:48:00]  Is it acceptable  that this guy,  what's he making,  16, 18 million  a year before  endorsements?  Yeah.  Leaves a three-buck tip.  I mean,  if I was David Stern,  I would suspend  the guy for the  rest of the season.  When does the book  come out about  his tipping habits?  The fucking...  I don't know  if I'll do a book  about LeBron.  The giant hardcover  book about how  he tips poorly.  When does that  come out?  I think I'm going  to, you know...  And where's the  bed end?  Yeah.  And the movie. 
[01:48:30]  And the movie.  The movie.  King James Doesn't Tip.  King LeBron James  right now.  I'm saying it  on your show.  Oh.  I'll go one-on-one  with him in the ring.  I'm not afraid of him.  Like boxing or something  or tipping?  Yeah, I'll take him on.  You know what?  I'm going to do  what you do.  I'm going to take on Tyson.  I'm not scared of him.  Me and Tyson,  Madison Square Garden.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  See, anyone can do that, Ian.  You're challenging everyone,  but it never gets back to them.  Look.  That's true.  Me and fucking Brad Pitt.  I don't need Madison Square Garden. 
[01:49:00]  Right on the street.  Today.  Just fucking...  If he's out there  at 10 o'clock today,  I will fucking fight Brad Pitt.  What about you, Ed?  You got one?  I'll fight Pitt.  Pitt can't fight.  Look, look.  I think if LeBron's  Tyson's comeback  one-on-one  with LeBron in the ring.  I'm saying Fedor.  Fedor.  Anthony's going to  challenge Fedor right now.  Listen to this.  Fedor, if you're listening  or your translator's listening,  right now.  Right now.  Come down to the studio.  Literally right now.  Right now.  Yeah.  You're not leaving any leeway.  And I will fight you 
[01:49:30]  and I guarantee I'll win.  I'll win.  All right.  But it has to be right now.  Right now.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's coming down the hall.  Quite tired that night.  She said he looked,  you know,  he looked like he was  run over by a truck.  His eyes were bloodshot.  Ah.  Did he just play basketball?  Well, who knows, man?  You know,  Miami,  there's a lot of temptation.  Who knows?  Everyone knows if he played basketball.  It's on TV.  It's the news.  Did he play basketball? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, who knows?  Who knows?  You know,  that's his personal business.  Right.  That's a good point.  Ian, comment?  You know,  I also put this post up,  I furthered it with De Niro  because a waiter friend of mine  told me last year  that De Niro came into  a joint in Beverly Hills  and was way too whiny.  And he said,  when De Niro got out of hand,  we took things over  in the kitchen,  we were all rolling  on the floor  because they were putting  in big ones, 
[01:50:30]  goobers,  gobbers.  One guy pulled down  his pants,  peed in De Niro's food  and then they witnessed  De Niro chowing down on it.  Wow,  that's another exclusive?  That's another exclusive, man.  I like your exclusives today.  You know,  that's why,  you know,  when you go to a restaurant,  man,  I like to get a view  of the kitchen.  View of the kitchen.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, there he is.  No, no.  People want to talk to Ian.  I'm just trying to figure out.  Hold on there, Ian.  Steve in Connecticut, 
[01:51:00]  everyone very impressed  by this story.  Steve,  you're on with Ian.  His Highness,  excuse me,  I'm sorry.  Thank you very much.  His Highness,  I got a real quick question.  You're still in Miami right now?  I'm not going to tell you  where I am.  You know,  I'm on the road, dude.  He never does.  He's undercover.  Okay,  but you've got to be  going back to Miami  then tonight, right?  He just casually said  he's shooting a film.  Yeah, he's shooting a film.  Now we have to ask him  about his film.  We all pale.  We all pale in comparison 
[01:51:30]  to you, Highness,  but my question is,  if you're going to give it  to this waitress tonight,  either you have to be  going back to Miami tonight  or you're just lying  because you said  you're getting on a plane today.  His Highness likes  to fly his prey around.  You know,  his Highness can afford  to fly his prey around.  Oh, so you should be joining.  from city to city  and banged the hell out of her  and treated her like a queen?  What?  What are you talking about?  When was the last time  you got laid?  Two days ago. 
[01:52:00]  I'm married, though, Ian.  Sorry.  Well, look,  do you look at other women?  Yes, Ian, I do.  Yes.  Every day.  See?  Have you had a threesome  with your wife?  Are you open?  No, just in college, bro.  Or do you take the vows seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Sorry, bud.  Well, you're an honorable man  because about,  I'd say about 99%  of the people  who walk down the aisle today,  they don't even read the vows.  They have no idea  what they're saying.  They're just repeating 
[01:52:30]  the vows like parrots, man.  That's the same.  Real quick, though.  You're a genius  at changing the story.  So tonight you're flying  to my hand  to bagging this girl.  Off is one guy.  Off is one guy.  You're flying tonight  to bagging this girl, right?  That's the truth, right?  Because I'm bagging this girl tonight.  That's what you said.  You can't get us from behind.  It's Louisiana waitress, right?  So you have to be flying there tonight  because you already said  you're going to be on a plane.  I'm not jealous.  I'm not jealous.  You're jealous.  I'm just calling her out your bullshit.  You have bullshit bullshit.  I love how the fans  love fucking 
[01:53:00]  His Highness.  Oh, I know.  And they pick apart  everything he says.  They can't get enough of him, man.  You sound so frustrated  in marriage, man.  He's just making the fuck up.  All right.  Well, why don't we go to...  And he's taking it out on me.  Yep.  Why don't we put a real fan  of His Highness  on the line for once?  This is John Hoboken.  John, His Highness.  Hey, Ian.  Good talk to you.  So, let me get this right.  LeBron wants a $3 chip  for maybe one person.  He left $15 for $4  and you're bragging about it?  Ooh.  Dude, do numbers.  All right?  Okay.  Do math. 
[01:53:30]  Are you good at math?  What did you get on...  With all due respect,  did you pass math  in high school?  Yeah, I did.  And how do you know  LeBron was alone?  I never said he was alone.  You were thinking about  bringing four people  for a $65 bill  and you left $13?  You left 20%  and you're bragging  right now.  Exclusive article on it?  No, I'm saying  His Highness  out-tipped the king.  There's another king.  It's called LeBron James.  You're the king  of tipping 20%  on the king.  This was a battle.  This was a royal battle. 
[01:54:00]  Have you ever watched  WWF when they have  a royal battle?  Okay, well,  how many people  was LeBron with?  Three.  You got the chance.  Make up something good, Ian.  I don't care who he was  with his hand  on his fucking  four-inch cock.  The fact is  it's a numbers game.  All right?  It's a numbers game,  but you had four people  on the 20%  and you're bragging, Ian.  I don't want to say this,  for the record,  my dick's twice  the size of LeBron.  Once again,  change the subject, Ian. 
[01:54:30]  All right, John.  What's your...  I want to know  what your movie's about.  Oh, yeah,  you're filming a movie, sir.  What are you filming?  Yeah, I never revealed it.  I never watched it.  Oh, okay.  Until it's done.  All right,  that makes sense.  Otherwise,  they'd shut me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a good one.  It's not...  Give me a couple more  callers before  I hop on this flight.  All right, all right.  All right.  Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, Jimmy.  How you doing, Jimmy?  His Highness, 
[01:55:00]  how can one become  a wash woman cunt like him  and make a fortune?  Does he have a seminar?  Can I be like him,  boning different girls  all around the place?  Bullshit.  How does one be like  His Royal Highness?  Yes.  Jimmy,  I'll tell you what.  What?  You sound like a good guy.  You sound astute.  You sound like a student  of the game of life.  I will take you  one-on-one  into my office  and I will change your life. 
[01:55:30]  I make Anthony Robbins,  okay?  It's like LeBron  compared to Spud Webb.  Spud Webb.  I remember Spud Webb.  Motivate and change your life.  I kid you not.  I've done that to many people.  A motivational speaker?  Yes.  I have spoken many times.  I will...  Look,  I'll say this  to any of these motherfuckers  listening to your show.  They will criticize me.  If any of you motherfuckers  with your hands on your dicks  right now  listening to the sexiest voice  in radio  can do it better than me, 
[01:56:00]  I'll be the first guy  on my feet clapping.  But until then,  shut the fuck up.  Eat your potato chips  and go to Beth Frustrated  looking at your wife  and thinking of his heart.  Bravo.  Wow.  I don't know how you  come back from that.  I'm sorry,  but he got you, Gene.  Ian fucking knows  how to just own people.  Ken from Green Lawn.  Home of Harborfields High School.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, not too much, guys.  Hey, how bring you  a cheap fuck?  I want to know  how you took out  four people for dinner  and only spent $65.  What about everybody 
[01:56:30]  in a soda  and a shirt on  or a fry?  In Miami, yeah.  In Miami of all places.  What'd you get for $65?  Big Pink.  I recommend the restaurant.  The food was actually  compared to the rest  of the shit in South Beach.  Usually when I go out  in South Beach  when I'm there...  Ian, answer the question, though.  It's cheap, man.  You're deflecting.  $65 for four people?  That's impossible.  Four people, $65,  and no one had drinks?  Google the menu.  Google it, dude. 
[01:57:00]  Google it.  Google it.  And you'll see  what I'm talking about.  What's your name  in the restaurant?  Big Pink.  Somehow when you Google  Big Pink,  other shit comes up.  Wow.  There's a lot of  other shit come up.  Yeah.  What'd you guys eat?  Did everybody have  just bread sandwiches  and meatloaf  or something?  Yeah, we want  a plate of fries  and we want a piece of pie  and we get extra  whipped cream on it.  Yeah.  And $10 and under,  you're getting  one of the best meals  you'll ever have.  It's probably McDonald's  or something.  The food was fresh. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  Let me go to Vinny  in Brooklyn.  Vinny.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning,  your ass holiness.  Yes, Vinny Barbarino.  Oh, damn.  Tell me some jokes  that are new.  Okay.  I'm an extra on the set  where Ian says  he's filming.  Okay.  But he doesn't want  to reveal it.  He's doing a gay porn.  Oh, shit.  He's doing a gang  thing by 10 black guys  with 19-inch cocks  and he's getting  in every orifice he has.  Oh.  Oh, I've been  to that place. 
[01:58:00]  It's you taking it  up the ass  in the mouth  in the ear  and I'm just directing  traffic, so.  No, you're not, buddy.  You're the one  that's taking everything.  Good job, Vinny Barbarino.  Like the other  Vinny Barbarino,  John Travolta,  you're as gay  as a $3.  Wow.  What the hell  are you implying there?  At least I can admit  that I'm homosexual  and I'm proud  of being gay.  But, buddy,  you're just taking  it every week  when you can.  Don't turn me on.  I'm telling you  right now.  All right?  Yeah, I've played  a lot of gay characters.  Prove it, Ian. 
[01:58:30]  Prove it.  Jack Lee.  I've never got  a hard-on  for anything  fucking, you know,  more feminine,  you know,  more masculine  than Humpty Dumpty.  Yo, stop saying  you're taking  any ass  for 25 cents  a pop  and you know  that you're fucked.  The appetizers  are like nine bucks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, all right.  He's off.  Thank you.  All right, shut up.  We're looking at the menu.  You told us  to look at the menu.  Starters and snacks  are like nine bucks,  13.  I want brands  on this menu. 
[01:59:00]  I want fucking brunettes.  What's the cheapest  thing you can get  for people?  Let's do some easy math  for everybody.  Yeah.  So if everyone  got a lousy  garden salad,  that's eight bucks  a pop.  That's $32  in salads alone.  Bowl of chili  is only $5.  Bowl of chili.  So what do you guys  have at the Big Pink?  All right, I'll tell you.  One guy had the grouper.  All right, where's the grouper?  I had the Cobb salad  and soup.  It was a combo.  Okay.  Another person  had a burger  and the other one 
[01:59:30]  had a salad.  All right, the grouper  is $14.25.  The grouper is $14.25.  $14.25 right there.  All right, we're ready.  Let's keep track.  Cobb salad?  Cobb salad.  Soup combo.  Cobb salad is $12.  $12 for the Cobb salad.  $9.95.  What's the next thing?  What?  Half and half.  Half and half.  It's $9.95.  Oh, half salad.  Yeah, that's impossible  because half the Cobb salad  would be six bucks or so, right?  Soupy salad?  All right, maybe.  All right.  Combo for $9.95.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  There's taxes involved, too.  All right, we'll allow  his $9.95.  So grouper and Cobb salad,  what else do you want to do?  Then the burger.  Burger?  Just a regular burger?  One burger.  Cheeseburger, right?  No, it wasn't cheese.  Veggie?  $10.50.  Big Pink Burger is $10.50.  $10.50.  Round up to $11.  All right, and what was  the other guy?  And another salad.  What kind of salad?  Well, with chicken strips on top.  You know.  I love how Ian's got to tell us  what they all ate. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  The dumbest radio ever.  Chicken topping salad.  All right.  And what about drinks?  And what about appetizers?  Do you share some poppers  or something?  It's fucking $11.30.  Or $12 for the chicken salad.  $12 for the chicken salad.  All right.  Well, did you have appetizers?  Did you share something  while you were waiting  for your food to come out?  You don't get in shape  like his highness  by eating appetizers.  I understand.  I'm sorry that I asked.  A little dessert.  Did you guys get any sodas?  Sodas.  What did you drink?  Actually, I think the lady  with us, she had one crown. 
[02:01:00]  So she did have a drink.  A crown?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  One crown.  What the fuck is a crown?  Yeah, I think that's about it.  Let's do the math here.  All right.  I have the bill somewhere  right here.  You know what?  Let me dig it up, man.  Well, it's $48 without drinks  or dessert.  And tax.  We're close.  Yeah, we are close.  Yeah, we're pretty close.  It was $65.12. 
[02:01:30]  $65.12.  So, you know, look.  Maybe somebody else  had a soda.  I have no idea, man.  And you left how much  for a tip?  $13.  So $48 and $13 is $61.  Why couldn't you leave the $80?  No, no, no.  It was $65.12.  It was a bill.  Why didn't you leave $13?  Just leave $80.  Did you?  Look, A-Rod, man.  A-Rod.  Don't you round up  and just go,  fuck out here.  Here's $80.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  I do the math. 
[02:02:00]  Who doesn't do that?  $55, $13.  You know, I'm not Moses.  I'm His Highness.  His Highness lives 20%.  Well, his numbers do work out.  You can get some fucking chicks  on this phone.  His numbers did work out,  by the way.  Oh, sure.  One of the movies,  one of the,  we have to go, right?  All right.  We've got to go in a second here,  but one of the guys  that is in the movie  that you're making there, Ian.  Welcome to the show,  King Dong.  King Dong.  Good morning, boys.  How you doing? 
[02:02:30]  Hey, King Dong.  I just wanted to talk to my little bitch,  Ian.  How you doing, baby?  Yo, King.  I hope you're better than the stiff LeBron James.  You know, it's a blessing, New York.  Well, of course you call his ass a stiff bitch.  I'm doing nothing but a little ATM machine on our set, yo.  Yo.  Yeah, keep going, King.  Keep going.  I absolutely will, because that's what you're asking.  I think we're done.  Oh, my God.  Ian, we love you.  Yes.  Your Highness.  I love you guys, man. 
[02:03:00]  Just think of me tonight,  while I'm getting a lap dance from this Louisiana chick,  everyone whack off about 8, 16 p.m.  because she's going to be in my hotel room.  And I send out love to everyone out there.  I love everyone.  Thank you, Your Highness.  Everyone success.  I wish everyone success,  all the success and happiness in the world.  And to all you motherfuckers who are married and said the vows,  hey, you might as well be in your grave right now.  Wow.  Damn.  All right.  Blow everyone kisses, Ian.  Blow everyone kisses now. 
[02:03:30]  Kisses.  Kisses for everybody.  I blow kisses to everyone.  You guys are the number one fucking show in the world.  Thank you, Ian.  I'm Howard Stern,  but I think you guys are ahead of him right now.  Your Highness.  See you, man.  Thank you, sir.  There goes His Highness.  Always a pleasure.  We've got to take a quick break  because we've got Michael Orr waiting to come in  to promote his new book.  Yes.  Excited to talk to him.  Stay there.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Let's get Michael in here, man. 
[02:04:00]  The inspiration for the blind side.  Oh, hey, Michael.  Thanks for coming in.  How you doing, man?  Good, good.  Nice to meet you.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton to your left there, sir.  Danny Ross.  Try to be heavyweight.  Yeah.  Wow.  So you're walking down the hall and it's like,  yep, he is big.  God damn.  Yeah.  Offensive lineman.  You're the funny guy?  Sometimes.  Mediocre at best. 
[02:04:30]  That's what they were telling me out there.  They're trying to get rid of you.  Yeah.  I'm only kidding.  I've been trying for a long time.  I really like the blind side.  I'm not a big fan of Sandra Bullock,  but I like the movie in general.  And the one thing,  and I'm glad I read it ahead of time,  I was thinking that this is probably not  portraying you properly, this movie.  Because you come across in the movie,  obviously your character,  because you weren't in the actual movie,  as a dumb guy.  And I'm thinking, 
[02:05:00]  this guy's not a dumb guy.  No, I'm not like they portray me.  A little bit smarter than what they showed.  I really did a lot of things on my own.  I always had an inner drive to see it on my own.  And I've always said I was going to make it regardless  if I had to help or been taken in.  I could have been anything.  A garbage man worked in restaurants.  I was going to make it to put a roof over my back  and food on my table to make a decent life for me. 
[02:05:30]  Is that how you see the movie, though,  where they portrayed you a little dumber than you really are?  A little dumber than you feel.  You don't want to phrase that differently.  I'm sitting far enough away from them.  A little bit.  Because then in the movie,  they do show that actually you weren't dumb.  You just didn't know how to learn properly, I guess.  Yeah, in real life,  coming from public schools,  then going to a private school,  you're not going to see a lot of material  that they showed. 
[02:06:00]  And I had to catch up a little bit.  But once I got going,  it was a totally different story.  And the other part of the movie,  the little kid,  he drove me nuts  because he wasn't teaching you football.  No, I always, you know,  I've been, you know,  I prided myself on football for a long time.  And that's all I really had growing up.  And, you know,  I've been knowing sports since, you know,  seven, eight years old.  And, you know, I already knew how to play.  I didn't learn how to play football,  you know, with ketchup bottles  or, you know, Leanne teaching me.  But they needed to make it inspirational. 
[02:06:30]  I know, but the point of making it.  They did a great job overall, though.  Yeah, I know,  but I'm trying to, like,  defend you a little bit.  Separate back from a fashion.  Yeah, because in the movie,  they made it look like  he never played football before, ever.  Yeah.  And I'm like,  there's no way that's possible.  They would have been some great coaches.  They're supposed to be NFL coaches  if they can teach somebody  stuff they're fast.  Yeah.  Like Ant said, though,  it is Hollywood.  Was the kid helping you train?  That kind of annoyed me, too.  It made it look like,  here's the big dumb lug,  we'll show him how to live life.  And it's like,  no, they just took a guy in  who was homeless.  No, I've always been a hard worker. 
[02:07:00]  We ain't doing anything like that.  No, Hollywood's Hollywood, you know?  But were you watching the scene  where the little kid is training you?  Go ahead, Big Mike!  And you're like,  what the fuck is this?  Idiocy.  Basically saying the little white kid  has a better brain  than the black guy.  That really did annoy me  because that's what Hollywood does.  I was kind of annoyed by that, too.  Yeah.  I was just sitting back watching  and not every day  people have a movie made about him.  Especially where I'm from.  So I just took that.  Yeah, that is true.  We want people to read the book, obviously,  but what's the real story? 
[02:07:30]  Like, quickly.  You know what I mean?  Like, how did this family  discover you and take you in?  No, I was already at the school  and I just needed help getting from...  I had to...  From where I'm from,  it's a long way out there to the school,  so I couldn't...  I had to stay from different families  and things like that.  I already knew...  Sean was a volunteer coach  and he would help me put money  on my meal plan,  things like that.  And Leanne, she would take me 
[02:08:00]  shopping sometimes.  But I was already at the school  and just needed help.  My senior year going into my senior year  took me in  and it's been great ever since.  Did they really see you  walking down the street  and pick you up like that  or was that kind of...  Nah, it didn't happen like that.  I was already spending the night  over at the house  and they asked me  did I want to move in  and I said, yeah.  And how about...  Wait, what else did I want to ask too?  You did have...  Did they really ask  when you were going into college 
[02:08:30]  if they were like boosters  that had...  Did you really have a conflict  going into college?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we did.  I did talk to NCAA people  and question everything  because it's not normal  with the NCAA  somebody bringing you in,  especially alumni.  Right.  Yeah.  And how about the gun?  Was she really a gun owner  that went...  Went into the hood.  Opie saw the movie first  and he goes,  this one scene you're going to love  when she goes into the hood  with a gun.  It drove me nuts.  Those guys would have laughed at her. 
[02:09:00]  I don't know anything about the hood  but you've got to assume it.  Come on.  Yeah, you know,  Hollywood has been Hollywood.  You know,  that's a different story  in the neighborhood  where I'm from.  You know,  people do not do that.  You don't think  that the white lady  in the skirt  went in with the pistol  and frightened  the whole neighborhood?  I was like,  what are they doing?  Frighten the gangbangers?  Really?  No, that's not...  So there's nothing  that's real about this movie.  That was a great story, though.  How about...  There was kind of  the relationship 
[02:09:30]  with your real mom  in the film  was that  she was not around  when you were young  and that you were kind of...  How true is that?  Was that true?  You know,  she struggled  with her own things  but when she was able,  she loved us dearly  and took the best care  of what she could  and was just a product  of our environment  and it was nothing  that she...  Something she couldn't  do nothing about  but we took care  of ourselves  most of the time  and survived on our own.  Did you reconnect  with her?  We don't have a bond 
[02:10:00]  like we had growing up  and hopefully in the future  she's working hard  to get back on track  and we'll have that one day.  Oh, good.  Do you know where she is  and all that?  Yeah, everybody's in Memphis.  They'll keep in contact  with everybody.  And you're one of 12?  Yeah.  Wow.  One of 12 kids.  I was actually...  I knew it was based  on a true story  but one thing they did well  is they seemed to cast  people who looked like...  Like when I saw  your real mother,  I saw Leanne  and I saw Sandra Bullock  and okay, 
[02:10:30]  that wasn't that crazy  or Kathy Bates  is...  What was she?  Miss Sue?  Yeah, Miss Sue.  That wasn't...  You know what I mean?  And the guy that played you,  you're not an easy guy to cast.  You know, you're a big guy  but he was...  He thought he did a good job.  Yeah, he did, all right.  Did you like him as an actor?  Is it weird seeing yourself  portrayed by another person?  Your voice, the face  and the mannerisms?  Nah,  personality,  you know,  the way I act  and things like that,  it wasn't me.  It was awful little bit.  Yeah, you seem to be  a little more,  I don't know,  with it.  A little more animated,  a little more vocal  because here's pretty much 
[02:11:00]  what I got from the film.  I want to play football.  Like everything you said  was very low,  very, very...  Like it wasn't really...  Like you're very energetic  and personal.  You're a jock.  You come in,  you're like a regular jock.  A regular jock.  Yeah.  That's what they told you  in high school.  When they picked on you.  They didn't pick on me  because I was...  Nobody wanted to get made fun of.  They didn't pick on me.  Oh, you was funny  in high school?  Yeah, they didn't want to...  That was the only thing  that kept me from getting  my ass kicked.  But I'm saying 
[02:11:30]  when you came in,  I'm not even saying  that in a bad way,  but that's the way  jocks do it.  Like, hey, hey, hey,  you know...  There's more of a confidence.  Yeah, whereas the guy  they had playing you  was kind of like,  aw, shucks.  Aw, gee.  Golly gee type of guy.  No, that's the way  they're doing it.  Hey, Michael,  how nice was that house, huh?  Compared to how  you were living.  Aw, man, it was...  Was it as nice  as they showed in the film?  Yeah, it was very nice.  It was a different way  of living,  and it was great.  You didn't fold  those blankets up.  I try to keep everything  neat and clean.  You put it in the movie 
[02:12:00]  with the folded blankets  and the pillow all nice.  It's like,  I wouldn't do that.  I'd be in the kitchen eating.  I actually, yeah,  did that.  That's how I am,  and I make sure  everything's neat.  Yeah?  That's how I live.  I didn't like the fact  that they showed that  as a point in the movie,  like, we're supposed  to be shocked,  like, the big black guy  actually folded the blankets?  It was like,  that was supposed  to be the moving part?  Like, hey,  they are just like us.  But that was the idiocy  of that moment.  The black holds the blankets  so much.  The black-white thing  drives us nuts  in commercials and movies,  Michael,  just so you know 
[02:12:30]  where we're coming from.  Now, in the movie,  they portray the school  and the neighborhood  as very white.  Was that the case  in real life, too?  Yeah.  Where there was some racism  with the mom there  because she brought in  a black kid?  Because they kind of  showed that a little bit.  Behind the scenes,  I don't know,  I think there was,  you know,  a little bit of stuff  like that,  but nobody brought it  to me.  I got along with  all the students  at the school  and we had a great time.  So how long  have you been with the Ravens? 
[02:13:00]  One year.  My third year.  Oh, okay.  How long is your contract?  I said one  because he got drafted  in 2009.  How long?  I'm losing track of time.  I thought that was  kind of moving.  That was, to me,  the most moving part  of the film  was seeing the real you  and your real family.  I was like,  oh, wow,  that really,  because I didn't know  how the story ended.  Any, you know,  hardcore football fans  probably knew  that he played  for Baltimore.  You get to go  to the Super Bowl?  A 10?  No, I didn't go to the Super Bowl.  This year?  No, we didn't go.  We didn't make it.  No, I know  that you get to go.  I know we don't look  like jocks,  but we follow.  That's what I said.  Do you guys know anything?  No. 
[02:13:30]  How many baskets  did you make?  A lot of you guys  go down there  just to check it out.  I didn't go to the Steelers  made it  and that's our rival.  They put us out  of the playoffs  and I didn't even  watch the game.  So I watched  probably four minutes.  You can't even  like watch the game.  I didn't watch it personally.  You know,  we supposed to have been there.  We supposed to play it  and so we didn't do it.  Did you listen  to the radio show  that was on  in our place  when we were fired?  One time I did.  Yeah?  Yeah, I did.  And I laughed  really hard. 
[02:14:00]  Do you watch other shows?  They were brave enough  to finally beat the shit  out of us  because we didn't have a voice.  I remember like it was yesterday.  Yeah, I know.  Do you watch other football games  or I don't watch other stand-ups.  Very rarely do I watch them  because I just don't want to see it.  Is it hard for you  to watch other football games?  Maybe you can learn something from them.  No, no.  I'd rather just fucking  bumble along  and fail on my own.  There's no need to watch them.  Nah, I mean,  we watch a lot of games  on TV,  stunning film,  everything.  Were you happy  Pittsburgh lost?  You must have been happy  if they're your rivals. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, that's a big-time rival  so you definitely  don't want them to win.  And that was a heartbreaker too.  That wasn't like a blowout  that they could have handled  from the first quarter on.  They almost came back.  He doesn't know.  He didn't see the game.  Nah, he knows what happened.  I'm sure he watched the highlights.  Come on, once you found  that they lost,  you must have watched  every highlight.  My college teammate  Mike Wallace played.  I checked it out a couple times  to see how he did,  but I didn't watch it  before the game.  Who's the hardest guy  you have to play against?  Who's the guy you hate  going up against the most?  I'm not going to throw  any names out there,  but I love playing  the Steelers defense.  It's an intense rival 
[02:15:00]  and it's a big-time game  every time.  Are you pretty fan-friendly?  Because I have a weird thing  with athletes.  Most of the guys I like  are MMA guys  because they're the coolest  with the fans,  but some of the guys,  like we had  Terrell Owens in,  he was like,  you know,  kept the sunglasses on.  It's like one of those guys.  I try to sign  as many autographs  as I can  after the game  during,  you know,  whenever a fan  comes up to me,  I try to,  you know,  get all the autographs.  Has life changed  for you after the movie?  I mean,  it made you obviously 
[02:15:30]  a lot more recognizable.  Yeah,  it did,  but,  you know,  I think,  I'm just laid back,  you know,  chilling,  you know,  really don't get into  too much of the hoopla.  So you wrote this  to kind of,  I guess,  write the things  that you felt  were not told properly  in the movie.  Did they kind of say,  like,  you know what,  I want to tell it  from my point of view too?  No,  one reason I wrote it,  you know,  I started getting,  you know,  hundreds and thousands  of letters,  you know,  people telling me  I was a role model,  an inspiration,  and,  you know,  just,  you know,  to give them hope  and let them know 
[02:16:00]  that,  you know,  you can be anything  you want to be  as long as you,  you know,  stay focused  and,  you know,  do the right thing.  Was that,  there was one scene  where you fight in,  there's a fight scene  in the movie.  Come on,  man,  I'm smarter than that.  I would have took off  running.  Yeah,  because it was kind of weird  that he just gets up  and he belts like the,  With a gun?  Come on.  Everybody had guns?  Yeah,  and he just walks up  and beats them all up  because they insult  the family.  It's like that.  Again,  they were drug dealers.  You don't just punch  drug dealers  and they fall  into the fish tank  and you walk away. 
[02:16:30]  Did you see a lot  of violence growing up?  Because,  obviously,  you lived in a bad neighborhood.  Yeah,  that's,  I mean,  tons of it.  That's gangs,  violence,  drugs,  everything,  so,  yeah.  And what kept you out of it?  Was it sports  or was it just your mom?  Just,  no,  one thing,  you know,  in the cycle of,  you know,  going,  for me,  you know,  that's all I saw.  I had no mentors  or things like that.  You know,  you grow up,  you go to school,  you drop out,  you know,  do all that stuff.  I never wanted to do that.  I wanted a better life for me.  How is,  this is,  it was driving me nuts too, 
[02:17:00]  like,  do you read negative criticism  about yourself  on sports pages?  I mean,  there has to be some  and it's got to annoy you.  If some come across  the TV  or something like that,  somebody tell me something.  I mean,  it doesn't get under my skin.  You know,  you just got to work hard  and,  you know,  stay focused.  You can't,  you know,  let the people who,  you know,  barely know anything  about football  get to you.  Once in a while though,  I've read stuff about myself  I didn't care for.  I mean,  it really doesn't bother me at all.  I want to ask about  the shoplifting  when you were growing up. 
[02:17:30]  You got to do what you got to do.  I did a little shoplifting.  I was a,  I was a poor,  I was a poor kid  so I took my shots  in the fucking supermarket.  No doubt.  I mean,  what would,  what would you steal?  You go for the meat?  Anything,  you know,  candy,  meat,  whatever I could to,  you know,  whatever we could,  you know,  we had to,  you know,  eat it at night  so we had to get the job done.  You ever get caught?  I got caught  probably about four times.  Yeah,  because you're a big guy  and looking suspicious  in a supermarket. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah,  exactly.  Supermarket.  You're not flying under the radar.  Nah.  Did you go in with the big coats  so you could steal more?  In the winter,  yeah,  we did have coats and stuff on.  I was,  I remember when I was a kid,  me and my friend Marvin  stole,  um,  Star Wars figures  and we got caught  and we stole Chewbacca.  You were still toys?  Yeah,  you know how it is.  I was 19,  I didn't know any better.  And,  uh,  we were really,  we were really young  and,  uh,  I remember,  uh,  the security guard  took us in  and I never forgot this,  I remember Marvin  had put like,  I think the guy wanted 
[02:18:30]  to see Marvin's penis  because he had shorts on  so he made me leave the room  while he checked Marvin  because he thought he had  a Star Wars figure  down the front of his pants.  Oh boy.  He just wanted to see  Marvin's penis.  Of course he did.  He made you,  y'all didn't,  he asked me to leave the room.  All three of y'all  didn't stay in there,  y'all?  No,  we didn't put a cracker  on the floor.  No,  I,  I just,  uh,  I went outside  but I was so stupid  at that age,  I didn't know,  like,  you know,  he's probably looking  at Marvin's package  because Marvin  had a huge mule.  Even at that age  I realized Marvin  was gifted.  He was 13,  he had a beard,  you know how it is.  You know how it is. 
[02:19:00]  And he,  he had a little  Star Wars figure  in his underpants.  Oh man.  Well,  this looks like  a good book to read.  Are you doing  any book signings?  I did one at  Barnes and Noble  yesterday.  Okay.  Where?  Those places are  shutting down,  man.  The one in my  neighborhood is done.  It was Barnes and Noble  I think,  yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah,  there's still a few  out there.  A few out there.  Field Street I think.  Are you doing any more  or no?  Yeah,  I got one in Baltimore  tonight,  doing,  you know,  really all over  traveling,  be traveling forever.  You know,  about three weeks  promoting the booking.  Okay.  Trying to get it out there.  Do you know where,  how the teammates 
[02:19:30]  treat you?  Did they goof around  a little bit?  Nah,  everybody enjoyed it.  You know,  they congratulated me  and,  you know,  they told me  they were proud of me,  you know,  and happy for me.  Did your family  have any issues with it?  Like,  hey,  that's not exactly  how it happened.  Nah,  they loved everybody.  Oh,  they did?  Yeah.  Oh,  that's cool.  Yeah,  you'd wonder  because,  you know,  sometimes you're  portrayed differently  and be like,  it's not me.  No one tried to sue?  Not that I know of,  no.  Not that you know of.  Yeah.  Anyone else,  any of the siblings  doing well? 
[02:20:00]  My biological?  Yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  everybody's doing  pretty good.  Doing all right?  Growing up and,  you know,  got their own lives  and doing all right.  Do you change your number  so they don't call  and ask you for money?  Not from my family,  but,  you know,  distant relatives  and a lot of old friends,  things like that,  yeah,  if it's from  the area code  I'm used to,  don't answer,  leave a message  if it's important.  I know how it goes.  Have you had some people  come creeping around  looking for cash?  Of course.  Of course.  That's how the game goes.  Yeah.  That's all the time. 
[02:20:30]  Are you comfortable  saying no?  I say no in the heart.  Probably a record-breaking time.  No.  You know how to go.  Because in the end,  man,  I mean,  NFL player,  that's rough.  We knew a few of these guys  and it's a tough life  and you don't know  how many years  you really got.  Exactly.  You can be gone  the next day  and bank your account.  All of a sudden,  you see,  we just watch  and all of a sudden  you see one of these guys  limping off the field  and you don't know  that that's it for him.  You just assume  he's going to rehab  and come back  but a lot of these guys,  you see him limp off the field 
[02:21:00]  and never hear from him again.  That's fucked up.  And you're an offensive lineman,  man.  You're in those pile-ups  every fucking Sunday.  I don't know how you do that.  Just got to,  I mean,  pray and  just play the game  the right way  and try to,  hopefully you make it out  every Sunday.  Don't you love guys  like Eric Williams  who really,  you know,  I kind of like guys  that play a little bit dirtier  because I didn't have to face them  so it's kind of fun  to watch them.  Michael really has to go.  He's got a hard out  because he's got a lot  to do today.  Michael, 
[02:21:30]  thank you.  I mean,  hopefully come back  and see us again.  The book is called  I Beat the Odds  from Homelessness  to the Blind Side  and Beyond  and it's Michael  telling his story  from his point of view  and straightening out  I guess certain things  that were told  a little inaccurately.  Thought you guys  were going to never  read the title.  Oh, yeah.  We did before.  We'll do it a little  and then this replays all day.  All right.  Awesome.  We just sold you some books.  Trust me, Michael.  Appreciate you guys.  Thanks for having me on.  We're going to do a quick break  and then we got JWoww  from the Jersey Shore next.  Stay there. 
[02:22:00]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the O'Bee and Anthony Show.  Michael was all right, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  He was very cool.  Did a lot of interviews today.  A lot of TV.  We had to get him out of here.  Yeah.  Where's JWoww?  She's coming down the hall.  I think they're trying to  get him on the bestseller list.  He's got The View and... 
[02:22:30]  Wendy Williams.  Yeah.  Is that what they're trying to do?  Yeah, he did.  Here's Morgan.  He could definitely talk football  with Wendy Williams.  Okay.  Oh, I get it.  It's like she's wearing  shoulder pads every day.  Yeah, she's a big gal.  I keep trying.  All right.  The shoulder pads  slip down onto her chest.  See, because she's got...  I should have just stopped.  Why?  I don't know.  That was a good one.  I don't know.  I was going to say also  when you were talking  about your high school experiences  and he was talking about his 
[02:23:00]  that you could have a movie  called The Backside  because you're an ass.  But I didn't.  I'm glad you didn't.  I didn't think it would get a laugh.  That would have been hurtful.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  Morning, JWoww.  It's JWoww.  JWoww.  We have to apologize,  I hear, right off the bat  for our old producer.  Yes.  Sam.  Hi.  I didn't realize  you guys remember that.  Hello, JWoww.  This is Steve.  Hello.  Could you please call  because we want you  for this program.  And I need...  Would you like to be  a cam girl on Foundry? 
[02:23:30]  So what happened?  Yeah, Sam interviewed you  from our show.  Yes.  We were on vacation  or something.  And then he told the story  that our old producer,  he's no longer with us.  He bothered you  to the point  that you either  changed your email  or your phone number  or something.  That's great.  I don't know the full story.  He was just texting me  and I had no idea.  I was like,  all right.  Because I was new to it.  Everybody was new to it.  We were all new to it.  And then, you know,  30, 40 text messages later  of asking questions.  And I thought it was like,  is he like a reporter 
[02:24:00]  and he's just saying  that he's from Open Anthony?  Because it's stuff  you would ask.  What was he saying?  What was he asking?  Just like,  I need you on the show.  I need you on the show.  I got this,  that,  a third to talk about.  What's going on with this?  Are you really going there?  Are you doing this?  And I'm like,  but he claimed  to be one of you guys.  Hmm.  Well,  see how that worked out.  Yeah.  He's not here anymore.  Wow.  So he was just kind of  annoying you with questions  and you had to change it.  Oh, that's...  No, I never...  I just stopped ignoring it.  Because I was like,  I asked MTV,  I was like,  you know,  can I go on?  And they're like, 
[02:24:30]  no.  What are you doing?  No.  And I was like,  uh-oh.  Did he send you  any inappropriate texts?  That's probably  where I would have went wrong.  It was tough  getting these guys at first.  Yeah.  Because the show was so hot.  But now we've had  the situation on,  we've had Vinny Rules.  He was based on our show  a few times now.  I'm a lobbyist.  His uncle is classic.  Oh, he's hilarious.  He came in here  and just made us laugh  for an hour straight  with his homemade shitty wine.  Just horrible,  horrible homemade shitty wine.  He made Brooke Shields  drink his shitty wine. 
[02:25:00]  He's sweating in January.  Yeah.  This guy's definitely  got a drinking problem.  He's great.  Yeah, he is really...  He's a good time.  Yeah.  He's definitely a good time.  So you, uh...  You were being bothered  by Steve  and you finally ignored him  and did he continue  to contact you?  I mean, yes.  It's so classic.  Every once in a while.  You have no idea  how happiness makes us.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not because you were bothered  but just because he's  getting tossed around.  I just want to know  how he got my number.  I don't know.  We don't know how he does. 
[02:25:30]  That's the mystery behind it.  We don't know how he does.  Wow, that is odd.  That's why I thought  he was like a reporter  and just saying  he was somebody else.  Right.  Figured out how to get your number.  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't give it to him?  No.  No.  It couldn't have been  motivation on his part.  No.  Yeah.  We never saw that.  I'm, uh...  I'm watching Jersey Shore  and I like this season a lot.  Thank you.  Do you...  Is it being portrayed properly?  Yeah.  You know, they really  can't make anything up  because it is our actions.  Right, right.  A lot of fights, man.  I love the chick fighting. 
[02:26:00]  Did you see the mid-season trailer?  Uh, no.  I don't know if I did.  Oh, watch that one.  Yeah?  Wait, am I behind?  Some fist to cuffs?  No, it's a trailer on MTV.  It's to show you what's to come.  Yeah.  It's intense.  Some fists flying?  Yeah, it's like to another level.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Maybe I didn't...  No, I definitely didn't see this then.  I mean, not like roommates  but, you know, relationship drama.  Yeah.  Really.  Right.  You know.  Do you like guys like that?  Like, in real life?  Like, guys that are kind of aggressive?  You know?  Because I tend to be like a mellow... 
[02:26:30]  I don't like to fight.  Do you like guys that like to kick ass in bars?  No.  Not that we're going to go out,  but I'm just saying...  Well, that was kind of like my ex.  He had like the Napoleon complex.  Oh, really?  So he was always barking.  Like five...  He was my height.  Oh, he's barking.  Oh, you're pretty tall.  I'm 5'7".  5'7", okay.  And you're from Long Island, right?  Yeah.  What town?  I was trying to figure it out.  Franklin Square.  Franklin Square.  I just heard that Franklin Square is like the number one place where people get killed  of a car accident.  Really?  On the news this morning.  Hempstead Terpike.  Hempstead Terpike is nuts. 
[02:27:00]  Hempstead Terpike is the worst road in almost America at this time.  Yes.  I can't believe that.  Yeah, yeah.  People try to cross it.  I don't know what the hell they're doing.  Try to get to A&S Bagels.  Tell me.  4 in the morning.  I get plowed over by a truck.  It's terrible.  I'm from Huntington.  Ant's from East Northport.  Oh, okay.  We're North Shore guys.  Massapequa.  Danny lives in Massapequa now.  There you go.  Yes.  But he's a Queens transplant.  And a Queen.  I didn't date a lot of...  We're the Queens.  A white stone flesh.  I didn't date a lot of girls on the South Shore because you girls were a little tough. 
[02:27:30]  We're crazy.  You girls are crazy.  We're insane.  My girlfriends are crazier than me.  Really?  You come across a little tough and crazy on the show.  A little bit, but my girlfriends put me to shame.  Really?  Yeah, I milled them out.  I milled them out.  The base shore chicks where they would tease the front of their hair up and spray it.  We called it the waterfall.  Yeah.  Because it just looked like...  They wanted it to look like they had a lot of hair, but it only looked that way from the front.  So they turned sideways and they had brushed all their hair forward?  Yeah.  It was hysterical.  It's a front poof. 
[02:28:00]  A front poof?  We called it the waterfall.  It's just like cascading.  It wasn't like Snooki's hair.  No, no.  She has a lot of hair, so she can just do whatever she wants with it.  Were you so jealous of not being dropped in the ball like Snooki was on New Year's Eve?  No.  I actually thought...  No!  I actually thought she was really going to get dropped, so I was nervous for her.  Were you?  I'm afraid of heights, so I'm thinking that she's going.  You thought it was just going to be like, yeah, just a free fall?  Yeah.  I'm like, she's going to be on the middle of Times Square, going to drop like 20 flights?  I could never.  But it was really amusing what they did with her. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, they kind of put her in a big hamster ball and then just lowered her down to the ground.  She loved it.  Were you surprised how tough Sammy Sweetheart was?  You know what?  I can relate to her a lot.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they fought on the show.  Yeah.  Sammy Sweetheart looks like she's got a punch.  Oh, when she hit Ronnie?  She hit Ronnie good.  I never saw that until everyone else said.  And she almost nailed you, too.  No, you know...  You guys missed each other by inches in that one fight.  But the reason why I didn't really want to fight her is because I could relate to her.  My ex did a lot of the same things Ronnie did. 
[02:29:00]  And all my girlfriends would tell me, and I wouldn't believe them.  This was years ago.  What was he doing?  Like, hooking up with other girls?  My ex?  Oh, he was cheating on me.  I talk about it in my book.  Like, he was cheating on me left and right, lying, different cell phones, different MySpace  accounts.  It was disgusting.  He was all in.  Oh, yeah.  And all my girlfriends told me, and I didn't believe him.  How do you cheat on a JWoww?  With ugly...  Oh, man.  I wouldn't even care.  Like, if it was like Pam Anderson, I'd be like, you know what? 
[02:29:30]  At least make them better looking then.  Yeah, good for you.  But I mean, like, meth-looking addicts like chicks.  I'm like, what is wrong with you?  Oh, that's hilarious.  I was looking through the book.  Actually, there's one thing that really stuck out.  It was like the first thing.  It was called smushing.  And I like what she wrote a lot, because it was about sex the first time with a guy.  And she's like, sometimes it's not going to be good.  And I kind of like to hear that honesty from a woman.  I bet you do.  Please.  Then I know at least I get to fuck a second time.  And they're like, oh, it wasn't just a mistake.  He really is lousy. 
[02:30:00]  He really does stink.  But at least I get to in.  Tune in for a second time, right?  Yeah, but it's like, it was good to hear that honesty.  Because usually people talk about sex.  They're like, it's going to be amazing.  But like, what do you find can make it awkward when you're first, like, banging somebody?  Everything can make it awkward.  No booze.  Yeah.  If you're not at least a little buzzed, it's going to have a little boost, especially for  the first time.  Yeah, you've got to loosen up a little bit.  Yeah.  It's just.  But not too much.  There's a big fall off.  Right.  It's like a graph.  It's like, oh, it's really good.  You drink a little more. 
[02:30:30]  Better, better, better.  Oh, we had too much to drink.  Yeah.  Oh, that graph really drops off.  There's a fine line for the first time.  Yeah.  Yeah, because she's like, it could be wrong or whatever, but then she's like, especially if  he can't get it up.  Has that happened to you?  No.  Not in particular.  But my girlfriend, two of them, that's what I write about, had those type of situations.  Oh, jeez.  You know, and it's not even that.  It's like you go out, you have a great time at the club, and you want to hook up after,  but, you know, guys have a performance issue when they're, you know, 14 drinks in. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I've had those.  You know, it's humiliating.  You have to make up an excuse.  Like, oh, I took Dramamine because I flew today.  Dramamine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You what kills my dick is antihistamines.  I forgot we're allowed to swear on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It'll be a good time.  Do whatever you want, man.  Yeah, but I can't.  Try spraying it in your nose.  That's probably why.  I was forcing those little pills in.  So you've never had a guy have that happen.  What have you had awkward and bad?  Because I've had some horrendous sexual experiences.  Some were my fault, some were the other person's fault. 
[02:31:30]  What have you had happen that you found to be uncomfortable?  Like, what do guys do wrong?  A lot of things.  I don't even know how to, I mean, I don't want to air anybody out, but.  You don't have to say names, no.  Just like, it's, you think they look better in, with clothes on.  Oh, comes on, clothes come off and it's.  Oh, it's just like.  Yeah, it's disappointing, right?  It's like, yeah, it's like.  You go out with a lot of guys that work out a lot, or is that just bullshit for the show? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that's what I love, and that was not my ex.  So when they take their clothes off, they just look out of proportion?  No, I mean.  Like a belly?  Yeah.  Out of shape?  Because when you wear, you know, loose shirts, or you have big arms, you really can't tell  what the belly looks like.  Oh, jeez.  And, you know, that, or they have.  We're all sucking in our bellies as you say that.  Or just, you know, performance issues.  They're nervous, and then they make you nervous.  And then, or they make weird noises.  That was the big thing. 
[02:32:30]  What's a weird noise?  I don't know.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  Yeah, like, they bring shit back from, like, their childhood.  I don't know.  Like, that they have, like, mommy issues.  I don't get it.  Like, baby noises?  I don't know.  Yeah, just things like that.  That's crazy.  I'm sure if they saw you naked, though, there's going to be some noises coming out of my  hole.  It's just like.  I tend to make Stooges noises while I'm going down on a woman.  Like, if I like it, I'm like.  Something, stuff like that.  Yeah.  But that's why.  That way I would be very self-conscious getting naked in front of me, because I'm in very 
[02:33:00]  mediocre shape.  I look like two people melded together.  Like, from the waist down, I'm okay.  Like, I have decent calves.  Not that you want to see them, but maybe sometime.  You're a conjoined twin.  Yeah, from the waist up, I'm just, I'm like, something really went wrong.  But, JWoww, he has no hair, though.  Which is, show, show.  I literally, I'm very wishfully.  He's not, he doesn't shave.  That's how his.  That's just kind of girlish and smooth.  Just touch it.  That's good.  Feel how.  That old gag. 
[02:33:30]  Sorry.  We haven't done that.  I'm sorry.  That just makes me happy.  We're assholes.  I noticed you, as a younger guy, when I was like, you know, in my 20s and shit, then there'd  be maybe performance anxiety and shit like that.  Like, you'd put so much thought into what you're doing.  You're just like, ah.  I feel like at that age, you just want to screw everything, though.  Yeah, but, like, you put a lot more mentally into it.  Like, oh, God.  Like, you're just happy to be getting laid and shit, and you're like, ah.  But, like, your thoughts are kind of like, oh, God, I've got to be good. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, I've got to do this.  I've got to, oh, am I doing this right?  But then, as you get a little older, it's just like, you know, fuck it.  Yeah.  Just fucking.  I have nobody.  I'm impressed.  Yeah, fuck it.  But less pressure when you're younger, because you could go seven to ten times a night.  If you're a little older, you're like, fuck, man.  Fuck, you know.  You're with the right girl.  You're still a kid.  I'm going to make sure there's a good one, because I'm not sure how many I got at me tonight.  No, I can't.  I never could do seven to ten.  You were never seven to ten?  No.  I was just one.  Over, like, a whole 24 hours of just staying awake. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, no.  Really?  Never.  No.  He reacts like a stooge, too.  Yeah.  What's your record?  How many times in one night?  I'd say at least three.  Three.  Yeah, three is three.  It gets kind of played out after that.  After a while, you wake up chafed and hurting.  Yeah.  Like, everything hurts.  It's just like, ow.  I'm more confident as I'm older, because you can talk and you can use smoke and mirrors  to kind of get around what will be an average performance.  Like, I figure a little spanking, like, all that type of stuff, which just kind of... 
[02:35:00]  Lights completely off, pitch black.  No.  No?  No, no, no, no.  I'll just wear a shirt.  I'll be like, yeah, I fuck rugged.  You know, and I'll turn it over.  But no, I don't like it pitch black.  I'm very visual.  And visual, yeah, it's got to be visual.  I have to see the person I'm having sex with.  You know, they may feel differently, but I prefer to see them.  He gives her welding goggles.  Yeah, exactly.  Just put these on.  Turns the lights on.  Those things they give you in first class to sleep.  Hey, back to Jersey Shore, because like I said, I am watching, and that one episode,  man, where you had to go back to your house. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  Break production.  There was a...  She broke up with her boyfriend during the filming of the show, and he basically said,  come and get your dogs, right?  Yes.  And she had to break into her own...  Well, no, you didn't have to break into your house.  You had keys.  But then she had to go through the house, and he took everything.  Yeah.  And left the dogs.  It was intense.  Yeah, that was...  Wow.  That was something I never expected from him.  Yeah.  But yeah, the bad dogs.  He did the old switch.  He told my girlfriend that my dad would take care of them. 
[02:36:00]  He told my dad my girlfriend would take care of the dogs.  Right.  Three days later, I had no answer, so I had to go up and get them.  And then she's in her own house changing the locks and seeing what he stole, and he stole  the bed and all sorts of...  Yeah.  I don't know what you want to say about that joke.  No, I mean...  Just moved down overnight.  You know, but...  Yeah, and he made statements like it wasn't true, but I like to go on the record.  Like, I did file a police report, and he returned my things to the police station.  So how is it not true? 
[02:36:30]  You know what I mean?  It just doesn't make sense what he's trying to say.  It's like the watch and the hard drive he did return months later.  Both damaged.  Never got the pictures out of it.  He damaged the hard drive?  Damaged the motherboard of it, and I lost everything, but it's not valuable.  It's priceless to me, but in the core, it's not valuable.  And then the watch, there's about a little over $1,500 in damage, because it was about  a $22,000 watch.  Wow.  And, you know, he said, oh, my sister took it. 
[02:37:00]  Like, come on.  And why did he take the bed?  We bought it jointly, and he made a comment the day that I left, and a producer did hear  him.  He goes, I can't wait to fuck another girl in your bed.  So, I was like, all right, peace.  I couldn't wait to get out of there, and that's when I went to go filming.  Right.  And I think that's what he was trying to, you know, make a statement about.  And I don't want the bed.  I don't want anything, you know.  Was he jealous, you think?  Because, like, you know, they're showing you with other guys, even if you're just hanging  out.  That's got to be, I was like, I watched that.  I was like, that's got to be really hard if you're a boyfriend to see.  No.  Or to know.  You know what? 
[02:37:30]  Because I am dating someone now, it's all about security with yourself.  And, you know, he, from the beginning, the show brought out the worst in him, the insecurities.  You know what I mean?  Like, he wrapped his life around me, quit his job.  He didn't have a car.  He lived in my house.  I paid for everything.  Like, so his life was embedded in me.  And he could control that.  But he couldn't control me filming.  And that's the thing.  Like, he couldn't be by my side 24-7.  Did he encourage you to go for that audition or for the read or whatever they had to do?  I tried out two years before I met him. 
[02:38:00]  He tries to say that he created, like, my name, J-Wile, has been, I've had since I was  22.  I met him two weeks before leaving for the show the first time.  You can see my anniversary on the show because it's July 25th.  I went on the show last year, August 3rd.  Wow.  So I was with him for a week.  I mean, I was with him two weeks before I hooked up with Pauly.  Oh, shit.  So he makes out, like, oh, you know, so drama.  Like, everyone knows when you first meet someone and you're not that close with them.  Yeah, shit's going to happen.  Yeah, and I hooked up with Pauly.  Right.  Big deal. 
[02:38:30]  He, like, harped on that for a year later.  Right, right.  And that's what kind of pushed me away.  Did you have sex with Pauly?  No, I kissed him.  Oh, see, that's the thing.  That's where you should empower yourself as a man.  I would have, as your boyfriend, asked you to tell me every dirty detail.  I did, though.  I would have made it hot.  No, I would have enjoyed it.  I'm a cunt.  He's fucking hot, though.  He's being serious.  Yeah, he's like, tell me, did he fuck you good?  And I would have made it.  But that's how you take somebody else's sex history and you don't get threatened by it.  You enjoy it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I stay with him after.  What were you doing right before Jersey Shore came calling? 
[02:39:00]  A couple things.  I had my graphic design business.  Yeah, because you made money, obviously.  You were able to buy a house.  Yeah.  That wasn't Jersey Shore money that bought that house.  No, I was quite successful right before I did promotions for nightclubs.  I had a graphic design business and I ran a members-only cigar lounge in Long Island.  So, I had three jobs.  Well, seven if you count four clubs.  Jesus.  Yeah.  What clubs?  You know, Origins.  I would hook up Glow with Origins is closed now. 
[02:39:30]  That's on Route 110.  That's where I actually tried out for the show.  Right.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, they did the casting there for Paracel and my new BFF.  My gay best friend wanted to be on it, so I tried out with them.  What do you do?  You just walk in and just talk on camera?  They ask you your story, your name.  How did the audition work?  Originally, they came in for Paracel and my friend was nervous, so I tried out with them.  And then a couple weeks later, they're like, yeah, you're cool for Paracel, but we got  this Guido show if you're interested.  I was like, all right.  So, I retried out.  And two years later, it was Jersey Shore. 
[02:40:00]  Damn.  On camera, all that.  Right.  Like 16 interviews.  And then, you know, I just, I wanted to get better graphic design work.  I wanted to get better promotions.  I never thought it would be like this.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, it's a massive hit, obviously.  Yeah.  Are you traveling like the rest of the guys every weekend to clubs and all that?  I mean, I try to take a back, you know, I put them kind of on hold.  I really want to devote myself to the book and to like my tanning line and things like  that.  Tanning line, yes.  Yeah.  What's that about? 
[02:40:30]  Australian gold, JWoww black bronzer.  I'm coming out with a new product in a month.  But in tanning beds, out of tanning beds, spray tans, oils.  Do you get like, do you take it personally when a lot of the critics are like, oh boy,  these dolts?  No.  You know what, though?  I like to prove them wrong.  And because they only get to see one side, obviously, like having a good time on the  shore and drinking and hooking up, they don't get to see the other side.  Yeah? 
[02:41:00]  How's that working out for you?  I prove them wrong.  Okay.  I mean, yeah.  So, I mean, I'll prove them wrong if I get on the bestsellers list.  I'll prove them wrong when I break records.  We broke MTV records, you know, things like that.  Yeah, that was huge.  You don't seem as tough in person.  No.  I'm very down on earth.  On the show, you're like a tough, tough Long Island broad that's ready to crack some heads  if you have to.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm always like that.  There's more of a sweetness to you in the studio here.  No, I'm just, you know, because I watch the show a lot.  I'm very chill.  Yeah.  How much drinking goes on during filming? 
[02:41:30]  I'd say we go out like three nights a week, four nights a week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is the most stuff culled from those times where you're drinking?  Yeah.  I mean, they don't show.  We're filmed 24-7.  Yeah, yeah.  So, there's a lot of nothing.  Do you get a little more rambunctious when you're drinking?  A little tougher, a little more sassy?  Yeah, the Irish side comes out of me.  Yeah?  My dad's side.  So, that's probably what it is.  Like, yeah, that's why you come off like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My mom's Spanish.  My dad's Irish.  So, I'm just like a psychotic drunk.  That's a drunk.  That's a combination. 
[02:42:00]  See?  That's a way to put it.  Psychotic drunk.  That's a combination for crazy, man, right there.  See, I'm pitching myself for Jersey Shore.  Maybe you could, like, I want to be like the guy that kind of moves in and kind of keeps  the kids from doing anything crazy.  Like, if you're out drinking, I count your drinks and come on now.  Time to go home.  That would be great.  What a great addition you'd make, Jimmy.  You know, I figured, just to keep everybody in line.  The new Mr. Roper.  Yeah.  Spoiling it.  Just a creepy friend who's always in the hamper.  Like, what are you doing?  That's my underpants.  Hey, I'm just fixing it.  Did you really pee upstairs at that club behind the bar? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  You've probably been asked this in Milties, but...  I did.  I did.  You know what, really?  The only regret I have is because when I have kids in 20 years from now, Jersey Shore  is older, and we're, you know, they're going to be like, I want to go out.  I want to go to the club.  And I'm going to tell them, no, you've got to stay in there.  I'm going to be like, well, Ma, you're pissed behind a bar.  Like, what's your problem?  You know what I mean?  Like, that's going to be held against me forever.  Yeah.  There's probably a few things.  Like, you guys, you've probably been to parties and stuff where you end up peeing in the corner.  I've seen...  It's easier for guys.  Shit like that, yeah.  A lot easier for guys. 
[02:43:00]  She ducked behind the bar.  It was a closed-off section, and, you know, she dropped.  Downstairs, and, you know, girls' bathroom lines, I could see downstairs.  There was, like, 200 girls waiting in line.  And then we had to get through the crowd, and you don't understand, like, taking camera crews,  and then us, and security.  Take forever.  It would take 15, 20 minutes at least just to get downstairs.  Fuck that piss behind the bar.  Yeah.  I really enjoy this.  I'm looking through this book, and you have some really good sex tips.  Talk dirty.  She's really...  She's a trooper.  Jim, I was a fucking trooper, man. 
[02:43:30]  You like that, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you a good dirty talker?  Yeah, you know, I mean, you've got to be in the moment, and you've got to be attracted to the person.  I'll do anything if I'm attracted to them.  That's why my ex says we never had sex, because I want to go near him, because I was never attracted to him.  What did you like about him, physically, or was his attitude just annoying and turned you off?  The thing with him is, I like guys six foot three, bodybuilders, and I kept getting cheated on and lied to.  So my friends are like, you've got to find a normal-looking guy, just a regular guy.  So I started dating him. 
[02:44:00]  But from day one, I was never attracted to him.  Wow.  And then you add fighting, and then you add the daily things that we would do.  Was he good in bed?  No.  Oh, wow.  So he's trying to say, like, oh, I would, he went on like a radio tour.  He's like, oh, you know, you would just, she would just lay there.  Yeah, I'd just lay there, because I wanted nothing to do with you.  The one time a month, I would actually give in.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Like, I even slept in different rooms with him.  Like, I wouldn't go, oh.  So why'd you stay in the relationship?  I know we have to wrap up.  I'm sorry.  Oh, last question.  Why'd you stay in the relationship, then?  He would just, you know, he held a lot of things over me. 
[02:44:30]  Like, obviously, what he's doing now.  Threatening pictures and things like that, and saying he would leave my dogs.  To run away if I'm filming.  So he would let out the back door and just let them go.  He had control over you, unfortunately.  I had to talk about it in the book, though, so I air it out.  I like this a lot.  This is very sexy, and she's fucking very sexy and smells great.  Actually, I never read books when they come in.  Not that The Blind Side is not a good book.  I'm sure it's a great book.  But I think that's the one.  I'm going to be reading JWoww's book. 
[02:45:00]  We're promoting a lot of books today, JWoww.  Yeah, no, Michael Orr is great.  But I think we're going to have to read yours first.  The Rules According to JWoww.  That's it, I guess.  Thank you, guys.  You guys are fun.  All right, thanks.  Thanks to JWoww.  Well, quick break, and we'll finish up.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  You know what? 
[02:45:30]  I like the JWoww.  She was great.  I wasn't sure I was going to like her.  I do watch Jersey Shore.  I was team Sammy Sweetheart, but now I'm team fucking JWoww, Sam.  Team JWoww?  Team JWoww all the way.  I'm a local girl from Long Island.  Come on.  The book is called...  The Rules According to JWoww.  And she's signing tonight from 645 to 830 in the Monmouth Mall.  Is this tonight, Sam or Travis? 
[02:46:00]  Yes.  I think it's tonight, Barnes & Noble, Eatontown, New Jersey.  And then tomorrow night, Friday, she is signing, it looks like, Barnes & Noble in Staten Island.  I did that one.  That's a great place for a signing.  Staten Island.  You can stand inside for the...  That's like a huge fucking Barnes & Noble in Staten Island.  It's gigantic.  7 o'clock tomorrow.  She's really cool, man.  And she's fucking super sexy in person.  Yeah, Jimmy was definitely taken.  What do you want to do?  Eat her toes or something?  No, no.  She was sitting really close to me. 
[02:46:30]  Eat her toes.  She was sitting close to me.  And she wasn't doing it on purpose.  She was just where she was sitting.  And her knee brushed my knee a little bit.  And her foot was kind of touching my foot.  She was relaxing on my chair.  And her vibe is so sexy.  Her foot thing was on your foot?  Yeah.  But she wasn't trying to be.  Believe me.  Yeah?  She had no attraction to me.  I thought she was playing footsie with you.  Nah.  I would love to believe that.  But she was just chatting.  She's into those muscle-bound guys.  I was telling Sam in the break, I would give her such a lousy fuck.  I would be everything she hated. 
[02:47:00]  Like, I would be good at talking dirty.  And I would probably go down on her really well.  Oh, no.  I'm sick.  And then, oh, you're okay, sweetie.  All right.  And then as soon as the shirt came off, her vagina would just head for the hills.  You'd look at her face.  And she'd be like, the pleasure and stuff.  And then she'd be like, oh.  Then the shirt would come off.  Or I'd need my nipples rubbed.  And she'd be looking at my stupid baboon tits hanging.  I would really be disappointed to her in bed.  Holy shit.  Oh, she should bang me just to have fun stuff to go on the fucking net and trash me for. 
[02:47:30]  So she could write another book.  And say, oh, my God.  What guys do wrong.  Inspired by Jimmy Norton.  But she was great.  I thought she was very open.  I liked her a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  You're kidding, right?  Someone's writing, are her boobs real?  Yes, they are.  They look good.  Of course not.  I can see the top of them.  She wasn't really dressed.  It's a great boob job.  She wasn't dressed where you could see a lot of her.  But her legs.  She was dressed pretty conservatively.  She was packed into those jeans, really sexy.  She is fucking, she's sexy.  Yeah.  She's really sexy.  I don't get to see the exit of the guests during Valentine's Day because I have to read 
[02:48:00]  right after they're done.  Everybody's saying, like they're saying thank you to everybody and they just kind of have  to brush you off.  Yeah, and everyone's taking pictures and watching her walk out the door and looking at her ass  and I'm talking about fucking gold dipped fuck roses.  They're really nice.  They all give you the wave off.  Like, ah.  Yeah, yeah.  Tell them I said bye.  They call it J.  Tell that.  Okay.  No, that's okay.  They call it J-Wow because when you see it, you're like, wow, wow. 
[02:48:30]  But what's the J for?  What's that?  It's probably for, um, J, I don't know.  It's just a mistake.  Yeah, it's something.  Yeah, it's something.  You just do whatever.  God, she had a fucking, she's sexy, dude.  We had a lot of hot, like, you know who was really, Brooklyn Decker was really pretty.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I didn't feel like that.  So, huh.  Brooklyn, Brooklyn Decker is more my type.  J-Wow is more your type. 
[02:49:00]  Well, J-Wow was much more sexual, I think.  Oh, my God.  But she wasn't, again, I'm not deluded into thinking she was flirting because she really  wasn't.  She was just talking into the mic and not, she's just, she's just like one of those naturally  sexy people.  She would ruin me.  You know, I'd be like all these guys, like, she wanted me to get in the hot tub with her  friends, but I'd be too insecure, so I'd wear my t-shirt in the hot tub.  You'd have a wet white t-shirt.  Yeah.  And like her friends, her friends, boyfriends that are there with them, they'd be all like,  hey, and they'd take their shirts off and just, just ripped and stuff. 
[02:49:30]  And get in the hot tub and you'd be like, hi, hi guys.  Yeah.  My left eye blinking, doing self-deprecating humor.  My fucking, my utters floating on the water.  Yeah, you'd have to do like a defensive move right from the beginning, like right before  you take your shirt off, say something like, now, now, don't get jealous.  You know?  Well, just so, just so the ice is broken by you.  Yeah.  I made fun of me before you could.  Right, right, exactly.  Like, I know.  My bathing suit pulled up to my fucking, above my belly button, like William Frawley. 
[02:50:00]  William Frawley.  I'd be getting in the fucking hot tub like Fred Mertz.  Let's go swimming, Rick.  What, what's the, what's the mid-season trailer that I missed?  Well, they just put out, it's online.  They put out a video of like what's coming up later this season.  Oh, okay.  It's, has it been on TV?  They might have been after the show.  I don't know.  All right.  But it's just like, it's like a two and a half minute video.  Have you checked it out?  Yeah.  So what are they, what was she hinting at?  Just that it's going to be crazy.  That you think, if you think you've seen it all so far, you ain't seen nothing yet. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, hell.  Fights and shit.  Fights, everything.  It's Jersey Shore.  Sex.  Yeah.  Fights.  Fights, fight.  No, no.  That's it.  Just fight, fight.  I just thought fight, fight.  That's all I said.  That's all I said.  Goofy skin show.  Are we done fucking selling books today?  Oh my God.  Is everyone okay?  We're like Ofra.  Are we a library?  Enough with the books.  Who reads?  I know, right?  I think I finally told Sam.  Sam's like, when we have people in here that are selling books,  Sam comes in and lays the book down in front of all of our places, 
[02:51:00]  where we're going to be sitting and everything.  And he comes by and he goes to put them down.  And I just finally told him, finally, after all these years,  I finally told him, never put a book in front of me.  Why don't you save them for your display thing eventually?  Because you're going to have a display thing with all this.  Well, I don't care.  There's almost always at least one book.  When it's time to clean the studio and you guys are gone,  at least one book.  There's a couple that I want.  Sometimes there's three books left over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:51:30]  We won't mention.  Exactly.  We won't mention.  But something like Shatner, something like that, William Shatner.  That gets taken home.  That gets signed.  That's fucking, to me, is ultra cool.  You know what?  Oh, Survivor Man.  Who has his books?  Do we have any copies of them?  Plenty.  Jimmy, is that a hot shot right there?  Chapter 9.  Oh, look, she's in a little teddy or something.  She would be a fucking great bag.  She's a beautiful girl.  You know what I do every spring?  And it is the truth.  I throw away a shitload of books that I do bring home that are autographed. 
[02:52:00]  Why?  Because I don't want them.  Because it's clutter.  Bring them in and raffle them.  I should at least bring them in, I guess.  I have a lot of bookshelves.  Sell them.  And stuff.  So I just pop books on bookshelves.  The one in my room is the craziest, eclectic fucking shit.  Because it's books from here that I put in my bag.  And then when I get home, I just take them out and pop them up.  So it's everything from, like, Ted Nugent to fucking, like, that stupid book that that guy wrote about picking up chicks that was all bullshit. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  And then there's a book about Hitler.  Brocabulary.  Brocabulary.  Brocabulary.  When we moved, I created a bookshelf just like that.  And it's all made up of books that you didn't take home.  That I didn't take home.  That I just grabbed and threw in my bag.  It's like, I don't have a good one.  Yeah.  Hey, man, I live in New York.  I don't have room.  Three copies of Chris Jericho's book.  Oh, shit.  Anthony's house is at least six to eight times bigger than mine.  At least.  I save them, though, and then eventually.  I have nowhere to put them is what it comes down to.  Put them in storage downstairs. 
[02:53:00]  And then when you get it, like, you should display them.  I mean, if you ever want to.  What are you going to do?  You have the fat smash diet on your bookcase?  What was that?  The one E-Rock did take home?  Oh, come on.  See, E-Rock, I don't go for those jokes anymore.  It's just for Hitler.  I have a bookcase, but I don't read a whole lot.  So, like, you need something to put on a bookcase or else it looks stupid.  It looks stupid.  So you just have the fat smash diet on there.  It's filler.  It's filler.  Yeah, yeah.  I have Jim Norton's two wonderful books on there.  Those are mandatory.  I have Kevin Smith's books. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I have both of Kevin Smith's books.  Yeah, yeah.  Are we still talking about books?  Yeah, yeah.  You said enough about books, and it started a book discussion.  That's how this dumb show works.  I know, I know, I know.  Sam and I were just discussing that we would go down on JWoww.  I told Jess yesterday that JWoww was coming in.  I was going to ask her if she'd be my girlfriend.  Oh, what are you, crazy?  Jess said, good luck.  You could show her your wrestling figures.  Oh, shit.  Jess knows.  Dad, she not me, faggot.  You're a Hulkamaniac.  Yeah.  She totally fucking knows. 
[02:54:00]  You are out of your league with Jess.  Go for it.  She knows it.  So you can't do anything.  She'd just be like, I don't care.  You would be, the second she leaves you, she will be in bed with somebody ten times better  than you.  And I'd just be like, god damn it.  And you'll be looking for somebody, yeah, with your fucking action figures and your fucking  wrestling knowledge.  What, are you going to go to the bar?  Hey, how you doing?  You watched WrestleMania last night?  Be like, no.  She'd be like, no.  Well, let me tell you all about it. 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  She's so hot, I would eat her pussy with Sam.  Wow.  I would lick her vagina with him, and I would never lick a vagina with somebody.  Really?  I would do that.  You'd fuck a girl if someone's watching.  No, I would be nervous.  Like, double team?  I have, yeah, but I don't like it.  Yeah, you've done that with, you know, certain people, I guess, with Ron Jeremy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you wouldn't lick a pussy with her?  No, I don't want my mouth touching where a guy's mouth is fucked up.  No, no, I don't mean that.  I mean, like.  Same time.  No, no, no.  No, I was joking.  It's the same time I'm saying.  Oh.  Oh, see, I'm being literal Anthony. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, no, I'm just kidding.  I didn't know.  That would be so sick.  Oh.  It's not a very realistic possibility.  Yeah, exactly.  Can we go back to the books for a second, because Kevin has a very good question in Houston.  Kevin, go ahead.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, what's up?  Does anybody have the more than a catch from that New York Giants player?  I do.  I do.  I think you're wrong.  Thank you, Kevin.  I have a fun of that book.  We make fun of that book, by the way, every time someone comes in with a book. 
[02:55:30]  And we grab the book.  More than a catch.  It wasn't stupid.  It was a catch.  Is this more than a catch?  Because what happened?  I have a copy of it signed to commemorate my interview with David Tyree when he thought  I was Anthony.  Yes, that's what we did.  Right.  Yes.  That was when we franchised the show.  He didn't like my Jerry Dice impression.  What happened?  Is that worth replaying today?  That one's so funny, man.  The more than a catch interview?  Love that.  Have we played it in a while?  Oh, let's play it today.  Because we've been talking about books all day.  It's a good book.  Well, the best, there's been two great book interviews. 
[02:56:00]  The more than a catch, or more than just the catch, was a great interview by Sam and  E-Rock playing Opie and Anthony.  And I must give myself a little credit the day I peed on the guy's book for five straight  minutes.  Yeah.  During the interview.  Was that the bro-cabulary?  It was one of those.  I think that was bro-cabulary.  It was bro-cabulary.  That book sold a lot of copies, man.  I think it's horrendous, but you know what?  That son of a bitch.  I don't know why there's a market for that shit.  It's a gift book for people who buy, like, for their nephews or their cousins. 
[02:56:30]  They think that's a guy thing?  That's a gift book.  Have you ever read more than two pages of one of those gag books?  No.  No.  Sorry.  They always look almost good, and then you pick it up, and after two pages, you're like,  what?  I'm going to do another 150 pages of this?  Oh, my God.  I have a signed copy of The Governator by Ian Halperin.  Oh, The Governator's a big one.  He signed that while I was at his bed-in.  That's where his book is ranked right now?  Yeah, so keep making fun of more than just the cash.  Wow. 
[02:57:00]  It's 400,000 times better than The Governator.  The Governator on Amazon bestseller list is at 534,945.  There can't be that many books out there.  That's impossible.  Wow.  It's the last book on the list.  Yeah.  Should we look at some other Ian Halperin books?  No.  There are self-published books.  Speaking of Best Of, I was listening on the way home yesterday.  Uh-oh.  Who fucked up?  Uh-oh.  No, no, no.  It was.  It was actually fucking hysterically funny.  Damn it.  But it was a Bob Kelly bit. 
[02:57:30]  Like, Bob Kelly was in, and then he played a Bob Kelly appearance.  Who did that?  I guess.  Iraq White.  They're talking to them like, Iraq, we can't hear it, but you've got to defend yourself.  No, I, uh...  Me like food!  I love that.  Burn.  I don't know if I get yelled at now.  Every time he turns the mic on, it gets yelled out in the background.  That was Roland.  Roland yells that out in the background.  That's Roland's t-shirt catchphrase. 
[02:58:00]  Me like food!  Holy shit!  No, I'm not complaining because the bit was funny, but it was a Bob Kelly segment, and  Bob Kelly was in with us yesterday.  Yeah, I don't think that was me.  I was in a meeting at that time.  Ah, the pass.  I didn't, uh...  Who did it?  I love the pass.  So we'll never find out.  Jimmy!  Jimmy, we'll never find out!  Who did it?  It was someone else!  Who did it?  Who was it?  I believe it was Travis. 
[02:58:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Wow!  Oh, no!  Here comes Travis!  Here it comes!  Travis is marching down the hall!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Travis!  See, now I know you guys are talking about it.  E-Rock just sold you right the fuck out.  Sam, Sam, I don't know what happened.  Can you tell Travis, please?  Well, Anthony said that there was somebody who stupidly played a Bob Kelly bit after Bob  Kelly was already in, and then E-Rock said, it definitely wasn't me, it was dumb Travis.  Well, that's cool because Bob Kelly wasn't in yesterday when I was running the board. 
[02:59:00]  I didn't say that.  So, what you heard was on Tuesday when Bob Kelly was in, and Eric was running the board  that day.  Yesterday, Scorch's PFG TV number one played.  And that's a good choice.  Oh, okay.  All right, because I was listening to that, too, and I was laughing my balls off.  Back to sexy beat.  You're right.  Okay, so it was the day before yesterday.  My mistake saying what day it was, but now it just really tied you up because...  So, why did you play a Bob Kelly bit?  It wasn't...  If something played with Bob Kelly in it, it was not a Bob Kelly featured bit. 
[02:59:30]  It was called...  It was called Bob Kelly burn victim comedian.  No, that was Voss and Bob Kelly talking about some burn victim comic that you found online.  Who?  No, yeah, but it turned...  The bit itself, which I will just say, which was hilarious, was we were all going around  talking about how a burn victim comedian would do his act, and it was...  The jokes were fucking...  Was I in for that?  Yeah.  You were hysterical funny. 
[03:00:00]  I don't remember that at all.  Dude, I didn't either, and that's why driving home listening to it, I was literally crying,  laughing so hard listening to that.  What was one of the jokes?  I don't remember.  It was just like, hey, you know, make sure you take care of everybody because you never  know what's going to happen.  And you're talking about his wig, his bad fucking wig, and he takes his joke list out from under  it.  Just like, it was such bad...  I have no memory of that.  And his dumb glasses taped to his head.  It was just...  It was so fucking funny. 
[03:00:30]  The point of it was...  Learn how to flee, asshole.  Exactly.  And the whole point was that it wasn't even...  I was just going to say how funny it was.  Not the fact that Bob Kelly was in and then a Bob Kelly bit played, but that reminded me,  and it was like, oh, we usually try to steer clear of playing something in Best Of from  10 to 11, that happened during the regular part of the show.  That's a very polite way of saying it.  How many times have you told Sexy B not to...  Hundreds.  Hundreds, I think, over the course of the years.  It's been hundreds that it's like, you know, you kind of burn something out if we're talking 
[03:01:00]  about, you know, a subject...  It's like putting too much bacon on a BLT.  Well, that's...  Maybe he can understand that.  Sexy B.  Sexy B.  Yeah.  That's his rap name.  And the, uh, I will laugh my balls off every time with that fucking Scorch, uh, Scorch  TV, that pretty fucking good television.  It's great, not good.  When he's talking about, and this is the part, I swear, I couldn't really drive. 
[03:01:30]  When people say I had to pull over, I literally almost had to pull over, not almost, literally  almost doesn't work, but I almost had to pull over listening to our show with shit that  we were saying, Scorch saying why he does what he does is my favorite fucking thought.  You know, I want you people to know, if you just turn around, he goes, if you just turn  around, because they're standing at the bar not looking at us, he goes, I do it for you.  And then, and then you don't hear anything. 
[03:02:00]  He goes, I said I'd do it for you, people.  And they start, well, and they were there, it's so pathetic.  And they were there just for the drink specials, not the free drinks, the drink specials that  he probably put together for them.  The whole fucking segment was hysterical funny.  Is it time for more Scorch?  He's so douchey.  His show, PFG TV, I mean, it's not what it used to be.  Why?  Because now it's taped in like a, a real TV studio.  He's got flat screens behind him.  Don't like it.  Nope.  Don't like it.  It's Mance Vegas' hottest local show. 
[03:02:30]  Can we have some for tomorrow, maybe?  Yes.  A little bit for tomorrow?  Yeah, it's pretty fucking great.  That's what the P and the F stand for.  And the PFGciples?  The PFGciples.  It's like the naked militia, except they're PFGciples.  PFGciples.  And then the one other guy that talks about why he does what he does.  Nick?  The guy on the couch?  So his children can, so he has something to say he did for his children.  It's like, look what I did. 
[03:03:00]  Think about it this way.  If you were in school, think it like if you were a little kid right now and somebody came  up to you and said, my dad is Nick Carpinelli.  Yeah.  He actually said that, too.  He said that.  It was so douche-chilly embarrassing.  They were the worst reasons ever.  Oh, the horrible.  Terrible reasons.  I do it for you.  I get paid, you know, whether I get paid a lot or a little, I just have fun and I get  paid for having fun.  I vote for a little.  It was so good.  What he said, he started saying, no matter how little, and they said, no matter how much 
[03:03:30]  we get paid.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he didn't want everyone to know how little he actually gets paid.  Oh, that's his new studio?  Yeah.  We'll see.  It looks like Mr. Rogers.  It's even newer now.  That's horrible looking.  Why is he wearing Crazy Eddie's old get-up?  He's got like a white turtleneck and a blazer on.  He looks like a conductor.  And I will say this, if his outfits are anything like they were in Syracuse, they reek of dog  piss.  Oh, you said that, too.  Because he goes, you know, he's talking about high school and how, you know, I used to get 
[03:04:00]  beat up by the people.  He goes, but now, you know, now that I've made something of myself and, you know, I'm  Will Drist, and then you chimed in of how everything he owns is covered in dog hair  and smells like dog piss.  He literally, he had a, his old sidekick told me that the week he left Syracuse, somebody  came into his old sidekick's studio and said, what, a ScorchCon?  And then Paulie goes, yeah, why?  And the guy goes, oh, I didn't smell dog piss around here anymore. 
[03:04:30]  Dog piss.  It's just mean.  Obviously very funny, but Sam is the most ungrateful fuck in radio history.  It's mean.  No, I'm saying that's mean of them to do.  Of course.  This Sam that now works for us, man, learned a lot from Scorch.  No, I'm telling you that what they did is wrong.  He's got, he's got an end table from his grandma's house as his desk.  It's also, you got to look at the laptop because the great, you know how on TV shows they put  a sticker over the logo on the laptop?  Yeah.  It's a Toshiba laptop and he put the PFG sticker right on top of, like, so it says PFG and then 
[03:05:00]  under it, it says Toshiba.  Toshiba.  And they're not a sponsor.  No, of course not.  But he probably says they are.  Yeah.  And maybe they'll see the show and pick me up.  They paid for this.  47 cities in 28 states.  And London.  And London.  And London.  Who's he interviewing?  Those are just his pals, right?  Well, no, he interviews local bands from Syracuse and Manchester, New Hampshire.  Let me see how many views that one has.  That's a picture. 
[03:05:30]  Craving Lucy?  Yeah, they're good.  We're going to have to get some Scorch.  Yeah, because I really, I was fucking laughing my balls off.  And I'd heard that.  I remember hearing that a few times.  But, and the Burn, Bobby the Burn victim comic was fucking hilarious.  It just would have been nice if it hadn't been on a Bob Kelly day.  Yeah, yeah, perhaps.  But that was Travis's fault.  I think Bobby's going to be in tomorrow.  No, that was Sexy B.  Well, whatever.  Well, Bobby, the thing about tomorrow is I'll be on The Tonight Show.  What?  Yeah.  But that's tomorrow. 
[03:06:00]  How could it be tonight?  Well, it's called The Tonight Show tomorrow.  And we get to be here again.  Tonight is just called The Tonight Show as well.  But then tomorrow it would be The Tomorrow Show.  I don't care about my stupid gig in Connecticut.  Who cares?  What?  What is that one?  I don't even want to get into it.  Foxwood's April 30th.  Me, Brewer, I tell Bird's going to sell out.  I'm not saying shit.  I wouldn't.  Nobody brought it up.  Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.  I think it goes on sale.  And hopefully it will sell out very quickly.  I hope so.  And you'll be on The Tomorrow Show.  Yes.  And then Chelsea on Monday. 
[03:06:30]  By the way, the band that Scorch was interviewing on that couch.  Craving Lucy.  Craving Lucy.  Has 118 Twitter followers.  Nice.  That's pretty good.  I mean, do you have?  I should be craving friends.  I should be craving friends.  Yeah.  And if you're in L.A., I'll be at the Melrose Improv Saturday night.  Sorry to keep whoring.  No, that's fine.  I don't think it's sold out yet.  I know Vegas is sold out, but I don't think L.A. is.  That's not humiliating at all.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  Those L.A. people.  Yeah, yeah.  Oscar's around the corner. 
[03:07:00]  We leave you today with an Oscar moment.  All right?  We did it?  Awesome.  I think so.  All right.  Let's do this.  See you tomorrow.  Thank you.  We appreciate you.  You know.

[03:08:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  On the virus.  Serious XM.  It's not the same like it was.  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer, Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa.  And you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectile dysfunction. 
[03:09:00]  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction,  contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big fill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah. 
[03:09:30]  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype.  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.
