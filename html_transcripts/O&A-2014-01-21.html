<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with speculation about their absent studio engineer, Mars's, surgery, ranging from a rotator cuff injury to a sex change, jokingly calling him “Marsetta.”  The conversation then shifted to Chaz Bono’s post-transition appearance, focusing on his topless photos and weight loss, comparing his look to Chris Penn. They speculated on Cher’s reaction and briefly mentioned a photo of Bono with Courtney Act. One host then graphically detailed a severe bout of stomach flu and its impact on his family, leading to a discussion about moldy fruit.  The hosts next discussed the impending polar vortex and criticized local news coverage of snowstorms, contrasting the jovial tone of "Good Morning America" with the more serious reporting of older news broadcasts, using the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination coverage as an example.

The show then tackled the controversies surrounding statements made by the Bachelor and other celebrities regarding homosexuality, arguing that discomfort with homosexuality doesn't equate to advocating violence, and criticizing the overuse of terms like "bigot" and "homophobic." They discussed the Matthew Shepard murder case and conflicting reports surrounding his death.  The conversation turned to the Sochi Olympics and concerns about potential terrorist attacks, specifically mentioning Chechen terrorists like the “Black Widow.”  A comparison of Russian and other cultures' behavior in conflicts followed. The show concluded this segment with a critique of the movie "The Butler," focusing on its historical inaccuracies and the liberties taken by filmmakers, warning of potential misinterpretations.

The next segment heavily featured a discussion of the movie *Killing Reagan*, focusing on the actors' portrayals (including Alan Rickman as Reagan and John Cusack as Nixon), its inaccuracies, and comparisons to other biographical films like *Dallas Buyers Club*, mentioning Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's performances (noting Leto's character was fictional).  The hosts were then joined by Bakhad Abdi, the Somali actor from *Captain Phillips*, who discussed his background, career, and working with Tom Hanks.  The conversation touched upon *Wolf of Wall Street* and then shifted to a critique of actors’ perceived reluctance to criticize President Obama compared to President Bush.  They promoted their podcast, mentioning upcoming episodes with Jerry Springer, Ice Cube, and a "Bob Kelly Super Puke" episode, targeting listeners who cancelled satellite radio. The segment ended with a discussion of Richard Sherman's post-game rant and Erin Andrews' reaction, followed by a lengthy, rambling, and increasingly offensive phone call with "Lady Di" and "Bill," filled with personal anecdotes, crude humor, and digressions about Bill's personal life and views on various ethnic groups.

A subsequent segment was dominated by a phone call with "Lady Di" and Bill, filled with sexually explicit and vulgar jokes, graphic descriptions of Lady Di's body and hygiene, and discussions of Bill’s potential alcoholism and their living situation.  Opie's upcoming dental work and frustrations with paperwork led to a caller speculating about dentists using nicknames for bill collection. Derogatory comments about Jill Nicolini followed. The show returned to Richard Sherman's rant, playing audio clips and discussing various perspectives on his behavior and the media's reaction, including racial undertones in the online response. The segment concluded with further calls about Sherman and other topics, and a brief mention of another celebrity's poor speaking ability on television.

The final segment discussed Richard Sherman and the public perception of him as a "thug," contrasting it with his academic achievements and charity work.  The hosts again interviewed Barkhad Abdi.  This interview was repeatedly interrupted by rambling, intoxicated calls from "Lady Di," which included insults and bizarre claims.  E-Rock, the show's photographer, explained the lighting challenges in photographing dark-skinned individuals.  The show concluded with the hosts discussing Lady Di's behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, good morning, everyone.  It's Opie and Anthony time.  Opie and Anthony time.  Is Mars still out?  Yeah, I can tell.  What's wrong?  I can tell. There's many things that...  Whoever takes over from Mars is very lazy.  Oh, shit.  Extremely lazy.  The studio is absolutely freezing.  Mars has it down to a science.  We have this very strange thermometer.  It's got a hair trigger on it.  It's a very small adjustment slider. 
[00:00:30]  It needs to be bigger so you get more detail in your selection of temperatures.  But you move it just a little tick and bam, it's fucking freezing.  And it goes up to 100.  And it's hot.  You want it to go to about 75, but it goes up to 100.  You can't figure it out.  But Mars has figured that out.  And the sound of the mics aren't what we usually like.  It's not what we're used to.  It's like the volume on an iPhone.  It's either at 6 or 94.  There's no comfortable place.  No. 
[00:01:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  What's up with Mars?  Is it an operation or something?  What is he getting?  What happened?  Yeah, he's getting surgery.  Rotator cuff?  Oh, he's getting his dick taken off.  Oh, he's becoming a woman.  Oh, I see.  He's going down.  Mars.  Yeah, he's been wanting to do that.  Marsetta.  Marsetta.  What a sexy name.  Oh, Marsetta.  He's taking the final step.  That's it.  He's been wearing the fucking dresses for a while.  And I guess that was working for him.  He plucked out all his eyebrows and draws them in like Hispanic women will do. 
[00:01:30]  And finally he decided there's only one thing left to do.  Speaking of which, there's so much to talk about.  But I decided out of nowhere that I want to see what Chaz Bono looks like nowadays.  Now?  And fast forward, what?  The last time she, he, I guess you've got to say he, which is very confusing to me.  It's the only reason I say it that way.  It's really extremely confusing. 
[00:02:00]  She, she, he.  She's got a vagina.  It's a she.  Well, when she was on TV, she was a she.  Anyway, she was on our show about, what, a year ago?  Probably a year and a half.  A year and a half.  A year and a half, yeah.  Wow.  She now looks like a dude.  All man.  She now looks like a dude.  It's really creepy.  It's really fucking creepy what they could do.  It's like a fucking, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  That's, that's Chaz Bono now?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  I decided out of nowhere I need to, I need to see what.  The beard.  Where Chaz is at these days.  The Abe Lincoln beards.  But she's got to wear suits wherever she goes.  Got to cover up those titties, I think.  No, man.  There's shots of her if you go to her.  Yeah, the top.  Wait, that's.  Yes, if you go to Chaz Bono.  If you go to her Instagram.  Oh, my God.  His Instagram.  See, I don't know.  That's hilarious.  There's a lot of topless shots.  And you would not know.  He looks just like Chris Penn.  You just would not know.  Chris Penn, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, he looks like Chris Penn.  Wow.  Even, even has like a guy's belly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, women can't have a belly like that usually.  Like a little gut.  When women have a belly, it's, it's, it's different.  It's more like, it's more like long gated or something.  You know what I mean?  That fucking Chaz went all out.  Yeah.  To just be a dude.  Maybe not Instagram.  I'm on, on Chaz's Twitter.  Yeah, that's the one I saw.  Look at that.  That's, that's unbelievable.  That's a dude.  You could see the only resemblance from the old Chaz is in like the cheekbones. 
[00:03:30]  And there's something about the smile that's very Chastity Bono.  Yeah.  But it's not feminine whatsoever.  And he hasn't been feminine looking in a very long time, but now with the drugs and  everything else.  Lost a little weight too, huh?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I got to get in shape so I can get the chicks.  Yeah.  Does he have a chick?  He's lost.  I don't know.  Something like 50 or 60 pounds.  So I don't know.  I don't know where I was like.  I wonder what Chaz Bono looks like.  Yeah.  How come you never see Chaz Bono with Cher? 
[00:04:00]  There's a picture on his Twitter with Cher.  Yeah.  One?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess she's, I guess she's in.  Yeah.  She's in.  I don't know.  It seems like she's sort of in.  What a collection.  If I had to guess, I would say she's sort of in.  That's from the TV show.  Right.  That's Chaz Topless.  Oh.  If you're going a little further, you'll see a picture with.  That's right.  A lot of, a lot of like, a lot of manly clothes, like, like khakis and collared shirts. 
[00:04:30]  It's definitely like the men section there.  A lot of ties.  Right.  Who's that delightful young lady?  The tall one.  Go back a couple, Sam.  I don't know.  Is it a.  No, it's a girl.  Tranny?  Who's that lovely young lady?  Yeah.  Chaz is hanging out with a couple trannies somewhere.  That's not a tranny.  That's a lovely girl.  Who is that?  Quick.  Quick.  I'd like an app mention, please.  Who?  Courtney Act.  Courtney Act.  Oh.  That's a girl, right? 
[00:05:00]  No.  No.  Whatever.  Whatever helps you sleep at night.  That's a little whatever helps you sleep at night.  Why would you agree to Judgment Hour?  We've all been Judgment Hours.  Oh.  The profile, profile cites her as the most beautiful man in the world.  Oh, really?  See, that's different then.  She's from RuPaul's Drag Race.  Oh, see?  I see.  She's probably an executive producer.  Oh.  There is.  That is just.  But you could produce a cuck if you ask.  Go back, go back though.  You'll see the, you'll see the share picture with Chaz. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So, he's losing a lot of weight.  He seems happy.  And he's way more a guy now.  Totally.  Even then when he was in here.  Total dude.  There you go.  There's the picture with Cher.  And look at that.  You would never in a, you would never think that used to be a girl.  That's got to be odd for Cher.  That's so fucked up.  Yeah.  It's got to be odd.  You raised a girl.  You raised a little girl.  Wanted to raise a little, you know, blonde haired girl.  Right.  And fast forward a few years, you got a dark haired fat, fat son. 
[00:06:00]  Little fat son.  That's got to fuck with your mind.  Jesus.  Not so fat though.  Not as fat.  No, no.  Didn't she say she had trouble with it at first, Cher?  Yeah, yeah.  She's pretty open minded with that stuff.  I would be certain she'd have a little trouble with that.  Yeah.  That's a little, that's a, wow.  If your kid is gay, it's probably hard enough, like, okay, you're going to have a hard life  and things switch up.  But when your kid comes, look, I want a gender reassignment.  That's got to be fucking heavy to hear.  Yeah, yeah.  That's got to be over the top. 
[00:06:30]  What the fuck?  It has to be.  What's with her son with Greg Allman?  She got the.  Well, then that one dresses like a woman.  What is that about?  I don't know where that's at these days.  See where that's at.  Find, what's his name?  Elijah Blue, I believe.  Elijah Blue.  Elijah Blue.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, we got it.  Oh, no, he's starting.  No, is he regular?  Was it a phase?  I think he's figuring out his stuff.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was a little, he was very, very strange. 
[00:07:00]  He was a little weird.  Yeah, he was.  But he looks.  Looks like a regular dude.  Yeah, he looks like he's all right.  I don't know.  He's like, I can't have fucking two kids that I want to be the other one.  Yeah, her son with Greg Allman.  Yeah.  How did that, how did that happen?  Cher and Greg Allman.  I know.  That was such a big thing back when.  Right.  There they are.  That's, wait.  Go back.  That's.  That's Chastity Bono. 
[00:07:30]  That's Chastity Bono.  With the long blonde hair and the girly face.  She's cute.  Very cute with like, you could see a little Cher in her face.  What happened there?  That is unbelievable.  I had a big crush on her when I was a kid.  When I was a little, little boy.  Yeah.  Everyone did.  She was just a cute little blonde kid.  Adorable.  Right.  Oh, boy.  So, that's unbelievable.  Now it's like, hey, how you doing?  Yeah.  Give her a little kiss.  You get the fucking whisker burns. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  Her Abe Lincoln beard.  There was no holding him back, huh?  He went.  He just.  Full bore into the world of, I want to be a dude.  I wonder if he's going to like, shape a penis out of something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Right.  Don't they do that?  I think he has already, right?  Didn't we ask?  We did ask.  I forgot what he said.  Some pump up thing.  Do they got the pump up thing?  I don't know.  I forgot.  I think he was trying to raise money for the penis, if I remember correctly. 
[00:08:30]  I maybe want it bigger.  So, but I think you got, I think you need the penis.  Yeah.  You need the penis.  You do need the penis.  Can you ask for a certain size when they do that?  Or is it just what you have?  Like, can you say like, I want to, I mean, because everyone would just ask for a giant  dick.  Give me a giant dick.  I think you're asking for as much as you can.  Whatever material they could muster up for you.  Takes them off the leg, would you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have to fashion a penis out of available real estate on your body.  So.  Can you wrap the skin around this beer can for me, please? 
[00:09:00]  A Foster's can.  A Foster's can would be nice, right?  I don't know.  Shit.  So that, that was just out of nowhere.  I just decided I needed to do that.  Yeah.  The other thing I lost, I lost five pounds since Friday.  What happened?  Fucking stomach flu.  Yeah.  The fucking stomach flu.  I knew something wasn't right on Friday.  I didn't feel right.  I was like, oh man.  Were you gurgling?  Were you percolating?  No, I just felt out of it.  I didn't sleep the night before. 
[00:09:30]  Got through Friday show, which I thought was, I thought we had a fun show Friday.  Oh yeah.  And then I went home and I wrote Bob Kelly.  I'm like, Bob, I'm going to go see you at Bananas.  And I was excited to do it.  And then I had a cup of coffee.  Oh.  That's it.  And all of a sudden, all hell broke loose.  That was, it was all it took.  And some fruit that was laying around in the refrigerator.  Fruit and coffee.  Oh boy.  Well, there was a couple of blueberries with some mold on it.  What's the deal with mold?  Oh, it's not good for you.  Don't eat it, dude.  No, I'm not.  Obviously, I'm not going to eat the mold.  Yeah, it's not good for you.  But I got rid of those, dumped those out. 
[00:10:00]  The fruit was only a couple of years.  A couple of years old.  A couple of days old.  And then I washed the rest of the fruit.  But I'm imagining if there's mold on a couple, then there's some microscopic mold on the rest, probably.  Those spores.  They have spores that get everywhere.  But my question is, what happens if you eat mold?  I don't know.  I don't think it's all that bad.  It's not, right?  No, but it's probably...  It might fuck up your guts.  Then I got the gurglies, and then...  How long after?  That's why I was suspicious. 
[00:10:30]  I ate some fruit, and then...  Because I was going to see Bob, I decided to treat myself to an afternoon cup of coffee.  Because I'm not really drinking a lot of coffee these days.  Just to stay up.  And then, I don't know, between the fruit and the coffee, forget it.  And then I had to freaking write Bob and say, I'm not going to make it.  I was so bummed.  And then I was...  Yeah, you know, dude.  And then I was just back and forth to the bathroom between Friday afternoon, all the  way through the football games on Sunday.  Yeah.  I haven't eaten much since Friday. 
[00:11:00]  And I feel fucking great.  Just running back and forth to the old bowl.  Running back and forth.  And then Sunday, it got so bad.  The noise that was coming from my ass as water was pouring out.  Dude, water just pouring out.  That's fucking disgusting.  Like, there wasn't even a hint of solid.  Oh, Jesus.  Pouring the fuck out.  I'll admit, I'm hard.  And then I have my kid going, ew!  Because kids have to fall... 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Kids have to fall into the bathroom.  No, I don't get this at all.  They'll let you, you know, grab one or two by yourself.  But if you're going back and forth, and I was babysitting the kids at that moment, they're  both running into the bathroom.  And then my son has to comment how bad it smells.  Oh, my God.  Just commenting how bad it smells.  He will remember these moments.  Of course he will.  Every time he drives by Staten Island, he'll think of you.  So, probably.  And then I'm getting, like, the shakes, the shivers. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, man.  Really bad.  And then so I would wrap up in a blanket, and then I was getting the cold sweats.  And then it...  Wow.  And then it all just went away.  That's all your body temperature leaving you.  Is that what that's about?  Yeah.  Through your water.  Your water-cooled fucking system at that point.  And then woke up yesterday completely fine.  Went to the gym and...  Ugh, Jesus.  Me and Jimmy are just standing there, topless, talking to each other.  Oh, yeah.  I just came out of the shower, and you were... 
[00:12:30]  I walked in...  I was changing.  I had just my jeans on, and now we're both bare-chested.  Rawr.  Having small talk.  Chit-chat.  Oh, is that the worst?  Bare-chested men.  That only works at the beach.  At the beach, you'll accept it.  Anywhere else, if you're hanging out with your buddy and you both don't have shirts on,  it's just awkward.  Pants are awkward.  Shirts are not to me.  I wouldn't care about that.  Like, because I've been to the pool or a beach, you know, just around the pool with enough  of my friends.  Yeah.  Being pantless would be weird. 
[00:13:00]  But I had...  What, with your dick out?  Well, yeah.  I mean, like, if we were, say, outside the shower, I would feel weird talking like that.  Like, that would be bizarre.  That would just never happen.  I would run away.  I would run away.  I'm not standing there talking to Jimmy.  A nude Jimmy.  With our penises out.  I'm not shy about that stuff necessarily, but it's...  I always cover up in the shower, and it'd be weird with a guy who I work with.  Just seeing him, Nate, would be odd.  One leg up on the bench, drying your leg.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  And it's been dry for 20 minutes.  He just...  And then Jimmy just stands there awkwardly, like, it's obviously time to move on. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I was kidding when I did that.  No, I know you were.  I was gonna add that.  Okay.  Of course you were kidding, but he stands there awkwardly, and I'm like, ugh.  I folded my arms on my head.  Because obviously it was time for me to take my jeans off.  But anyway...  By the way, you think it was the milk you put in the guabi?  I don't know.  I almost feel like I got...  I feel like I got food poisoning twice. 
[00:14:00]  Because after the gym on Saturday...  Because I wasn't sick sick.  On Saturday, I went and got a vegetable juice.  And as soon as I drank that, oh my God, the cramps I had.  It was unbelievable.  So I'm wondering if I got food poisoning twice.  But the odds of that are crazy.  You probably had it once, or whatever you had once, and then the second time, your stomach  wasn't ready for something in that fucking vegetable juice.  It probably over flooded your system.  So yesterday, I weighed myself.  I'm like, oh man, I gotta see what the stomach flu diet can do for you.  And I'm having a tough time losing weight, but I am losing, but it's taking forever this 
[00:14:30]  time.  And I lost five pounds since Friday.  Damn.  I can't tell you how much that is for me.  That's good.  Because I'm 178.  Right now, I'm 173.  So I'm wondering, how do you keep this off?  Well, you gotta keep shitting water.  Because it's all water, right?  You are a little proud to.  I saw him without his shirt.  Oh, I showed him my gut.  He did show me.  I was like, dude, I haven't seen your stomach in eight years.  I don't know the difference. 
[00:15:00]  Who knows the difference?  But how much water weight do you have constantly in your body?  A lot.  At least five to six pounds, I would assume, of water?  Probably more than that.  Even more?  Fuck.  So it's all going to go back on.  It could.  Right?  That stinks.  But now just totally fine.  Totally fine.  Anyway, we got the polar vortex coming.  That vortex is...  Why does it have to be the polar vortex? 
[00:15:30]  Why is that a word now that people are using for the weather?  It's brand new.  No one's ever used this.  Didn't it used to just be called a cold front?  Yeah, yeah.  Just a cold front.  Storm system.  But now we have to name everything.  Wheeling in.  Apparently, you know, it's the vortex.  Yeah, a little snow coming to our area.  Well, up and down the entire East Coast.  Yeah, the North East.  For the most part, all the way to Maine.  From what, Washington?  Yeah.  Everyone skates south of Washington, it seems, huh? 
[00:16:00]  For the most part, with snow.  Yeah, they get the rain.  But, yeah, it's supposed to start up late morning, early afternoon.  And continue until tomorrow morning.  All the way to tomorrow morning?  Until, like, 6 o'clock tomorrow morning.  Wow.  So, we are so not doing a radio show tomorrow.  6 to 12.  6 to 12 inch.  Yeah?  12 inches kind of east of here, which includes moi, and a little lighter west of here, which 
[00:16:30]  is usually the opposite.  No, I think the city's going to get a lot this time, too.  The city's going to get some, too, but not as much as Long Island.  And I don't know.  Kind of get coast.  I saw a lot of purple for the city, as well.  Yeah.  It's kind of on the 6 to 12.  It's more toward the 6 side than the 12 side.  And then Long Island's more the 12 side than the 6.  For the rest of the country, it's the strangest thing.  I live in the city.  Ant lives a mere, what, 20 miles away?  20 miles out.  And the snow totals could be drastically different. 
[00:17:00]  Just because Manhattan is surrounded by water, I guess.  Is that what that's about?  My house.  Yeah.  It has to do with that weather.  Water.  Fucking little island.  It's so weird.  The heat that the city retains because it's, you know, paved.  Right.  Yeah.  I leave my house sometimes, and it's fucking like winter wonderland.  And then I get to the city, and it's just a little slush on the ground.  Yeah.  It's a big difference, yeah.  So we'll see what happens there. 
[00:17:30]  That's a snowstorm.  It's a snowstorm.  We're not going to hype it up like everyone else.  It's a fucking snowstorm.  We're in the middle of January.  Vortex.  It's a snowstorm.  Yeah.  And we know how to deal with this shit.  Yeah.  No one's happy about it, but we deal with this shit.  And again, this.  Watch the news.  Oh, the news makes sense.  They're panicking.  When it snows, I just want to be in front of my TV watching local news.  Watching the coverage.  I'm obsessed with local news and how bad it is.  Yeah.  It is so bad. 
[00:18:00]  And they don't even think they're that bad.  No.  They love making it sound like it never happens, and it's the most fucking dangerous thing ever.  Right.  Listen to them, or you will die.  Oh, it's the best.  Yeah.  Let's say I was watching local news, and there was a lady, a monotone lady just doing traffic.  Yeah.  I'm like, why is this on TV?  Yeah.  I'm just doing traffic, traffic, traffic, traffic, traffic, traffic, traffic.  Who gets their traffic from TV? 
[00:18:30]  Nobody.  Who?  No one that's driving.  Even before the smartphones, who was getting their traffic from TV.  And why do they feel like they've got to still do that?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Because even if your TV is on and you're ready to leave the house, you still wouldn't watch the traffic.  No.  You just turn on your radio or you go to your phone.  I think what happened with local news, it's just out of habit.  Yeah.  They did it this way for so long, no one knows how to do it differently for whatever reason. 
[00:19:00]  They do a traffic report twice in the half hour.  Yeah.  Why?  I have no idea.  And then they show cameras on highways showing that the traffic's either flowing nicely or not.  I do like those.  You know, not that I use them.  I just like them because it proves the bullshit from the traffic reports.  What do you mean?  Eh, a lot of times you'll get a traffic report and they'll say it's clear.  Right.  And then you'll look at the camera online.  And it's like, no, it's fucking, it's a lot of traffic. 
[00:19:30]  It's really strange to me.  I don't know what local news is going to do, but they're so ready to be reinvented somehow.  Yeah.  And then yesterday morning I turned on Good Morning America.  I tweeted about it.  They laughed for an hour straight and I don't even know what they're laughing at.  They're chuckling.  At everything.  They're having fun in the morning.  They're having a good time in the morning, yeah.  Is that what you do when you're having fun is just laugh at things that aren't funny the entire time?  Sure.  Yeah.  Just ask our audience. 
[00:20:00]  Turn on Good Morning America this morning and ask me what they're laughing.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They can't go more than a minute without laughing at something that's not even close to funny.  They just want to convey that fun spirit that they have in the morning.  They'll just say their names and start laughing.  Exactly.  Just over and over again.  It's the strangest thing to watch.  I can't get enough of it though.  I don't know.  It's one of my weird fucking little things I like to do. 
[00:20:30]  I was watching some real old news yesterday and how they fucking pulled it off.  They had like the Martin Luther King assassination from like two weeks out until after it happened.  Wait, two weeks out they knew this was happening?  Well, no.  But they probably did as a matter of fact.  They had the news coverage of him in Memphis.  Right.  And then after the assassination and the assassination and everything.  But it was all old news footage. 
[00:21:00]  That's how what the show was.  Old news footage and broadcasters talking about the sanitation strikers and Martin Luther King's speech and everything.  And then the assassination and the aftermath.  And oh my God.  They just fucking called it like they saw it.  There was no attempt to PC it up, to entertain the people.  It was just here's what the fuck is happening in plain English.  Right. 
[00:21:30]  You know, no tiptoeing around what they're trying to say.  At one point, one of the news guys, the protest got rowdy in Memphis.  You know, a few people were in there busting windows and stuff.  And he's like, Negroes are running everywhere.  Just started laughing.  I was laughing at how odd it is to hear that.  Right.  But he's like, young Negroes are breaking windows.  Now Negroes are running in all directions.  I was like, holy fuck. 
[00:22:00]  But you know what?  He was seeing that.  And that's what he said.  I think we figured that out a while ago.  You know, now that it's a 24 hour news cycle.  Yeah.  There's no way you could keep up.  There's just not that much interesting news.  Back then, man, you waited all day for the news.  All day.  And there was no other way to get it.  How else were you getting the news?  People forget you fucking got the news.  You didn't have a computer in the morning. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  Which was days old.  Already a day old.  And and the news that came on at five.  Now, I don't even think they had five o'clock news back then.  I think it was six o'clock news.  I believe it was six.  And then then the national one from six thirty to seven.  That's all you had.  Or you had the radio.  But that was very local news.  Right.  Like 1010 Winds would have like New York news, really.  Right.  And even that, it was so delayed.  The transfer of information.  Unless it was some major event. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  If it was a major event, you know, yeah.  It would be on the radio immediately.  But besides that, like all that other stuff that mattered.  You had to wait all day.  That's the other thing they used to do.  We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.  And you'd be like, oh, shit.  Remember the fucking adrenaline rush you would get when that would happen?  You'd just be watching TV.  And we interrupt this.  But you're like, oh, fuck, they're interrupting.  And now you watch CNN.  Everything is breaking news.  Breaking news.  Fox News, too. 
[00:23:30]  Fox News alert.  They blew it.  And it's not an alert.  They blew it.  Because no one is looking up like, uh-oh, breaking news anymore.  Because they use it so much.  No one pays attention to that anymore.  That was like, when they first started using that, that was like a Scud missile was inbound  on fucking Israel or something.  There was a time you knew some shit was happening.  But not anymore, man.  Now it's like, shoo, Fox News alert.  Ah.  Well, breaking news.  You know, the Hoboken Mayor, Chris Christie thing.  That's breaking news. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's not breaking news.  That's nothing.  That's what he said, she said right now.  They started using Fox News alerts, and they still do, for, like, top of the hours.  Right.  So at every top of the hour, they just go, shoo, Fox News alert.  It's like, what?  But how many people are buying it now?  No one really.  There was a time you used to fucking, you would stop everything.  Everything.  But, man, with regular broadcast television, when that's all we had, and that fucking bulletin  came on, you look, because it could have literally been anything. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  It could have been, and it was, you knew it was going to be somewhat important, first  of all.  It wasn't some bullshit thing.  And you were like, well, are we being nuked?  Right.  Is this a nuclear missiles inbound?  Is the president dead?  Is it, you know.  And everything was, everyone was finding out at the exact same time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what's so creepy.  And then there was nothing to, like, you had to get on the phone and be like, hey, did  you hear?  Right.  There was no Twitter feeds where you get, and it was only people you knew that you talked  to about these things. 
[00:25:00]  Could you picture Cronkite breaking?  And we interrupt this with a special bulletin.  The One Direction singer is under fire for praising Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson.  Gay activists are saying it was inappropriate.  Back to your regular programming.  Never.  Is that a real story today?  Oh, yeah.  He praised him about something, and now people are like, oh, this is anti-gay.  Oh, Jesus.  But that's how emasculated the news is, like, that that's actually a story.  One guy said something to another guy.  Why don't you take your energies for fucking, like, the gay rights and stuff like about the 
[00:25:30]  Duck Dynasty guy or this guy.  Right.  And go and protest down at the Nigerian fucking embassy right there on third.  Right.  Or second.  Yeah, second.  Unbelievable.  It's just nothing.  They're arresting fucking gay people, rounding them up.  They are rounding them up.  Round them up.  I guess the bachelor guy is in trouble, too.  Yes.  For speaking out.  For saying not everyone is comfortable with homosexuality. 
[00:26:00]  Let me tell you something.  But everyone has to be, especially if you're on TV.  If you're in the spotlight, you have to absolutely be comfortable with homosexuality.  You have to accept it.  That's not fair in this country.  It's not fair.  You have to accept it as a thing.  We have to accept it.  But the way they want you, they want you to be comfortable with it.  Right.  And you can't make people comfortable with it.  A straight man watching two gay men showing affection for each other is, it conjures up 
[00:26:30]  something uncomfortable.  You're telling me.  I get with it.  Doesn't it?  It just is.  It's that weird kind of like, ah, you get this, ugh, vibe.  But you're not allowed to speak out about it, especially if you're on TV.  They asked the bachelor guy something about if they did a bachelor with a gay guy or something.  I don't even know.  Oh, they asked him?  I didn't realize they asked him that.  They asked him.  So he's like, I'm uncomfortable with this.  Yeah.  What's wrong with saying that in America? 
[00:27:00]  And then they make that the story.  Like, they ask you, just like Perez Hilton asked about a gay marriage.  And if you give an honest answer that isn't what the questioner wants, that's the story?  How the fuck?  Right.  If he comes out on Twitter and just starts blasting gay people and saying, I don't want  fags on TV.  Right.  All right.  I get why people would be irritated at that, because it's kind of an unprovoked dick move.  You ask a guy his opinion, and he says it, and you're upset with him?  Fuck you.  There's no way in this day and age, maybe the future will hold something different. 
[00:27:30]  The future.  There's no way you can force people to be comfortable with something.  You know, tolerance means, you know, you're tolerating something.  Right.  It doesn't mean you like it.  It doesn't mean, it means you have to tolerate it.  The word itself is tolerance.  You can't force people.  It doesn't mean liking it.  You can continue to educate people so they can make their own decision, an educated decision.  Maybe after it's commonplace for a long time or something.  But guess what?  You could educate all you want, and you're not going to turn people around.  No.  But you can't just have this blanket thing where everyone has to accept it. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Yeah.  You can't be, you know, not giving people jobs for things and stuff.  Or taking their jobs away because you ask them a question.  Yeah.  You know, as long as the guy's not running around beating the crap out of gay people or something, it's his opinion in America.  Yeah.  I think any opinion is fine.  As long as you're not advocating violence against anybody or advocating taking away someone's rights, you can express your opinions on certain things. 
[00:28:30]  And that includes people's lifestyle.  It's an opinion.  It doesn't mean shit.  You should say you used to be able to express your opinion.  You should be able to.  You know.  It's ridiculous.  And then they grabbed, Glad grabbed that guy, so he's going to now educate people.  Yeah.  Right.  What's the story?  There's some holes in this whole thing.  Because I wasn't completely prepared to talk about this. 
[00:29:00]  I just saw the headline in a couple minutes on this on TV.  Well, he was asked if there should be a gay bachelor.  And he's the current bachelor, I guess?  Yeah, I guess.  People watch that show?  I don't know.  Where would they put the rose?  Oh, boy.  Do the ladies just love watching The Bachelor?  Is it a thing?  I think it's people are still watching it.  I don't know anybody who does.  The ladies like it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He said, no, I respect gay people, but honestly, I don't think it's a good example for kids. 
[00:29:30]  And then he said, you know, that's a bit rough, but that's what he thinks.  He said, you have to respect everybody's desires, opinions, and way of living, but it would be too hard for TV.  Hard.  So what's wrong with that?  It's his opinion.  What's wrong with having that opinion?  What is that going to do in society? 
[00:30:00]  Does it make no sense?  I don't agree with him.  How is it a bad example?  I don't agree with him either, but once again, he should be able to say that without having any problems.  Just like there's an argument over nature and nurture as far as gay goes, there's also an argument as to whether children seeing that lifestyle, being around it as children of gay people and whatnot, affects the way they think of their own sexuality.  So it's someone's opinion, and I don't think there's any scientific proof either way that absolutely proves it one way or another. 
[00:30:30]  So some people can be of that opinion that they think it's not good for children.  I have proof that it's not pop culture.  Oh, yeah?  It's only been acceptable, quote-unquote, on TV for the last few years.  There's a lot of adult gay people over the age of 10.  What did they learn in Rome from fucking Twitter?  Yeah, they'll always be the old chicken and egg argument.  CNN has an article that says The Bachelor sounds like a bigot.  It doesn't. 
[00:31:00]  Everyone, the word bigot and racist and homophobe is thrown around so much now that it means nothing.  I was watching also yesterday, I was watching a miniseries from like 1978, King, with Paul Winfield, played Martin Luther King.  It was really good.  How did it end?  Oh, wow.  It's tragic.  Oh, boy.  They really pulled off that scene really well.  For a 1978 TV miniseries, it was pretty well acted. 
[00:31:30]  And they were showing some shit.  That is like, wow, that guy's a racist.  Fuck, that guy right there is a fucking racist.  And then the actors were saying that as they pointed out from their TV.  Neighbors at my window.  You know.  Jesus.  But then you get on Twitter and express an opinion or throw out a statistic or whatever the fuck. 
[00:32:00]  And someone calls you a racist.  You're like, wow, you have really brought that word down to a level of who gives a shit when it should be kept up at that fucking, you know, so you can at least identify.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  We've watered down all those words years ago at this point.  Homophobic, if you're fucking out there beating the shit out of gay people, you're homophobic, you're violent, you know, whatever.  If you voice an opinion on gays and teaching or gays and adopting and stuff like that, you're not advocating violence. 
[00:32:30]  Was there another story to the Matthew Shepard beating case was a big, big kind of gay launching pad for because he was gay and they said he was beaten up and tortured almost because he was gay.  Right.  But then I'm hearing it was something else that got him killed.  Like, was it or is that bullshit?  Some kind of drug escapade.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some some shit came out in a story.  But again, mainstream media is so fucking. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  They buried that one.  I don't know if it's true or not.  I don't know what the real story is.  So, yeah, I'm not sure either.  I heard that the people that he was involved with that that killed him were also involved with him as far as drugs go.  It wasn't some random gay thing.  But I don't know.  I don't know anything.  And did they.  Well, maybe people picked up on it because did they make it look like a gay killing because they wanted to cover up what they were doing?  Right.  That's what I heard, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who knows?  I don't know.  I mean, you could sit there and argue that one. 
[00:33:30]  But you'll see him, you know, if you go against the whole gay, he was killed because he was gay thing, you'll get people on your shit.  Well, I just heard that.  I don't even, you know.  I don't know.  They'll start calling you like a gay Holocaust denier or something.  The Putin doesn't like the gay, huh?  Putin hates the gay.  And you've got the Olympics happening.  Because he is old man.  He is old man.  You see him without his shirt on in every picture.  He's wrestling alligators or spearfishing or perhaps just roping lions. 
[00:34:00]  For a guy that doesn't like the gay, he certainly likes having his shirt off a lot.  Oh, he loves and just doing manly things.  I don't know.  What's that about?  I think there is some deep-seated gay urges in Vladimir Putin.  In the Putin?  That he can't hold back.  I don't know.  I think if you're a guy and you have your shirt off a lot, that's a bit mysterious.  Yeah.  There's a bit of a mystery there.  A little mysterious?  I don't know.  I mean, look at that. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, he's with a horse.  He's with a horse.  Bent over in front of it.  That's a little.  That's a little strange.  He is.  Would you ever be photographed with your shirt off next to a horse like that?  Feeding a horse.  And he's got the arm bent a little like, yeah.  And there's one with him fishing with his shirt off.  Pasty white fucking flabby body.  I don't know.  I don't know what that's about.  So what is he going to do with the gays in Sochi? 
[00:35:00]  In Sochi?  Is he going to, like, round them up?  Well.  Is he going to round up the gay athletes?  He doesn't want many gays around.  I don't think he's going to do anything, but he certainly isn't going to put it at the forefront.  Like, hey, look, we have gay people and we're tolerant.  Right.  No.  Why are the Olympics in Sochi?  I don't know.  Between the gay issue and the black widows?  Right.  And the fucking Chechnyan terrorists. 
[00:35:30]  That place is not ready for the Olympics.  Oh, my God.  This is.  It just seems like a strange one.  This is a huge security risk, I think.  This is some shit that will absolutely go down.  We'll just see how bad it is.  Chechnyans are probably amongst the worst terrorists ever in the world.  And, you know, that's going with al-Qaeda.  They have no discrimination as far as children go or women.  They will kill anybody to get their point across. 
[00:36:00]  Dude, I'm way more scared of Russians than anyone else.  Living in New York City especially.  Wow.  Wow, it's scary.  When you come across a Russian and they could be the nicest person in the world, you just have no fucking idea.  Yeah.  That creeps me the fuck out.  If you get in an argument with a cab driver who's like Indian or something like that, they will back down.  Right.  If you get on them enough.  Right.  And yell enough and stuff like that.  But the Russians, if the second you get in their face and start yelling, they will come right back at you and fucking, they are not afraid of fucking mixing it up. 
[00:36:30]  I see the Russian dads in the playground.  And they are intense.  Yeah.  And they're probably having a good day.  I don't know.  It's a very good day.  Shut up.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I have no idea, man.  Yeah.  So they're worried about these terrorists.  They got one out there, I guess, called the Black Widow.  Right.  And she apparently, she may have found her way inside, so she already. 
[00:37:00]  But how do they know this?  She's been missing from her apartment.  Yeah.  But if you're the Black Widow, wouldn't you just do it?  Well, she's waiting.  Yeah.  She's waiting.  No, but I mean, wouldn't you just, how do we know about this woman?  Intel.  They already have a dossier on her.  Her father was killed.  So they have a dossier on a lot of people.  Oh, yeah.  And this one's missing, so they're like, oh, fuck.  This is so good.  Where is she?  Yeah, they describe her on the radio, I heard.  She's got a four-inch scar down her cheek.  She walks with a limp, and her left arm doesn't bend. 
[00:37:30]  And I'm like, that is a fucking movie villain.  Wow.  It's like, that is a fucking, like, how do you not find her, by the way?  Unless every woman in Russia looks like that.  Her dad was killed in a shootout with police last year.  He was like a real Muslim, I guess, radical.  Yeah.  And they think she's already there.  Yeah, the Chechnians, let's not be mistaken here, they're Muslims.  Yeah.  They're fucking Muslims.  And they are ruthless.  The children they killed at that school, they hung up explosives from the ceiling. 
[00:38:00]  And it was unbelievable carnage.  And they don't care.  They just, there's no bargain.  They like Terminators.  Well, are the Russians still in Chechnya?  Like, are they still involved with Chechnya?  Are they backed out?  I think they left.  They left, didn't they?  Didn't they leave?  Am I an idiot?  I just don't know that.  I don't know.  I'm not sure of the Chechnyan situation.  But having the Olympics there, and I guess the United States is gearing up.  They've got warships over there.  Yeah, they've got warships and evacuation plans for the athletes.  Things get really bad.  Got to get your guys out of there. 
[00:38:30]  They're saying the athletes themselves are pretty safe.  Sure, like Munich.  Yeah, exactly.  But then they're saying, like, the families, even, and the athletes, not so much.  But the athletes themselves are in a ridiculously safe zone.  To make a statement like blowing some shit up and people up on a world stage like the Olympics  is very tempting to terrorists.  And the Chechnyans have proven they'll go to great lengths to kill a lot of people. 
[00:39:00]  There'll be some shit going down on the outskirts.  Yeah, yeah, maybe not in the village, but...  But, I mean, it'll be close enough where...  Yeah, they'll be doing something.  Where, you know...  A law.  It'll obviously be connected to the Olympics.  A law.  Yeah, that lady looks scary, though, man.  Oh, yeah.  She's 22.  She's not even, like, old.  How does she have this big, scary figure?  She's 22 years old.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  I thought she was older than that.  We just lucked out being born where we were born.  Black withle. 
[00:39:30]  We don't have anything close to these issues in America.  We get the occasional, you know, couple of thousand killed buildings, but...  We got our things here and there, but, man, I mean, there are places in the world they  just deal with ridiculous stuff.  We got our ocean tactical barriers of two fucking oceans, which helps out, and then we  got kind of civilized Canadians to our north, take care of business, and then a little strip  of old Mexico down there. 
[00:40:00]  Well, then we got our...  Yeah, we got the...  We just deal with that.  We got the pussies to the north.  The snow bunnies to the north.  The snow bunnies to the north.  Oh, man.  Harvesting their maple syrup.  I have no idea what they could get done if they just organized.  Oh, come on.  Jesus, what's wrong with you guys?  Why would you live up there?  It's so fucking cold.  The tundra.  Don't they realize the warm shit is just below them?  Oh, they...  Why would you continue to do that to yourselves? 
[00:40:30]  Here's proof that Canada is awful.  Bonnie married Rich just to get out of it.  Oh, man.  She took Rich Voss.  That really is a good point.  Man, you wouldn't even have to do much to just move downwards.  Yeah.  But they just refuse.  Hoboken mayor accuses lieutenant governor of trying to muscle a land deal.  Is that business as usual in Jersey?  A little muscling?  A little strong-arming?  They're saying Governor Christie looks like shit. 
[00:41:00]  He's a bit weathered.  Oh, is he?  Why isn't he talking, though?  If he's all innocent of this shit, he should be front and center.  Just continue talking.  I think he wants to move on.  He gave his state of the state.  And then he...  I guess he's being sworn into office again today.  Today the day.  Today's the day.  So, you know, he doesn't want to muck it all up with that talk.  Yeah, you don't have to muck up the works.  Yeah, muck up the works.  He's moving on.  A lot of people talking, though. 
[00:41:30]  Thank you.  But, you know, we know this shit goes on in politics.  They're all just shitty shit.  They're all fucking full of shit.  They're all just shitty people.  Just shitty power-hungry people.  Don't give a fuck what side you're on, either.  Yeah.  Here Obama came out with that statement saying that his poll numbers are low because people  don't like the fact that he's black.  But that's part of the reality.  Of course it is.  But...  Of course there's a lot of people in America that don't like him because he's black. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, but they've voted for him.  Huh?  Like, his numbers went down.  And they went down.  People didn't all of a sudden go, oh, he's black.  People all of a sudden went, wow, there's a lot of fucking unanswered questions in his  administration.  You know.  Agreed.  And I think that had more of an impact than the people that voted for him and didn't  care he was black then, all of a sudden coming out of nowhere and going, oh, he's black.  Let me not like him.  I don't think that happens.  Yeah, well, the reality of what he said he could do for this country and what he has  done. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, exactly.  There's a bit of a drop-off there.  Yeah.  People thought he was going to change the world.  Oh.  Hope.  Change.  And then...  And then you learn it's pretty much the same shit.  Business as usual.  Just stuck in the mud, as Jimmy likes to say.  Stuff like the NSA, you never would have thought that would happen under this guy's watch.  I know, right?  So much for transparency.  Oh, he was talking about transparency.  It has been the least transparent government administration I've ever seen. 
[00:43:00]  I believe he intended it to be, too.  You think?  I think when he went in, yeah, because I don't think he was in Washington long enough to  be a completely full of shit pig.  I think going into it, he really was an idealistic guy.  And then once you get the gig, you're like, oh, there's nothing you're going to do that's  going to change the way that system is.  It's the same as it was with Bush and with Clinton and with every one of them.  You know, at least be transparent, I don't know, with your own life.  The guy, you know, still transcripts from school.  We haven't seen or even know so much of what this guy did growing up and stuff. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know.  It's not very transparent.  It is a little strange.  And then...  I do find that strange.  Michelle Obama has her big birthday party and no pictures allowed.  Like, no cameras.  No cameras?  It's just...  It's this weird, like, no press, no cameras administration.  Well, wait.  No cameras.  Is it only family or is it friends?  No.  There were all kinds of celebrities there and whatnot.  I don't know.  I guess maybe she's getting pissed that people are calling her out on that big ass. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe that's it.  That big ass?  She's like, I don't want anybody taking pictures.  Why no pictures if you're...  You know, who's paying for that?  Well, it was her...  I don't know.  It was her 50th, so maybe she just wanted a fucking real private...  Private with, like, Samuel Jackson.  Yeah.  With all her friends.  Friends.  All her fake friends.  Mm-hmm.  They weren't friends.  They weren't friends with any of these people before they became president.  Maybe a couple.  I was invited to that.  All her fake friends.  Oh, you were?  I was busy.  Yeah, you didn't go to the president's...  Nah. 
[00:44:30]  The first lady's birthday party.  What am I doing?  Yeah.  I'll do the 75th.  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  I'm sure Oprah was there.  Maybe.  The whole thing.  From Oprah.  That rift with the Obama and Oprah.  That was a big story.  Oh.  What happened?  Oprah kind of left him hanging because she couldn't have...  She wanted access to the Obama administration.  She thought she was going to get, like, this exclusive access.  Nah.  And for Harpo Network or whatever it's called, OWN.  And she didn't get it, I guess.  And she was pissed off. 
[00:45:00]  And they said she could have really helped him sell this whole health care thing or whatever.  Oh, boy.  And she kind of left him swinging.  Because her opinion still carries a lot of weight.  But even though, since she's off the air, people do not give a shit about her, like, 50% of what they used to.  She still has a lot of power.  You know, The Butler is not a great movie.  And they had John Cusack playing Nixon.  Some unknown guy who looked nothing like JFK playing JFK.  I have no desire to watch The Butler.  I wanted it to be good. 
[00:45:30]  I got that screener copy.  I'm not going to pop that one in.  It didn't stink.  Who the fuck would watch that?  I'll tell you why I did.  Oh, sorry.  It didn't stink.  It wasn't a terrible movie.  It was just kind of like, ugh.  You know, I just didn't give a fuck about it that much.  I found out, like, half it was fiction.  I'm like, why can't they just make a movie about the guy?  Well, they had to make...  No, why?  Because he had no real stories.  It was just a bland...  They realized this, what, Butler guy worked for seven presidents, was it? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, six presidents.  Six, I think.  Six.  What do you fucking do?  So someone went in and went, holy fuck, this guy must have a story to tell.  And then they realized he's just a fucking bore, so then they have to make up half the movie.  So at that point, don't make the movie.  They gave him a radical son.  They gave him two sons, him and Oprah.  One son who became, like, this Black Panther.  And then a congressman.  That son never existed.  Really?  Never.  They gave Oprah.  Terrence Howard was in. 
[00:46:30]  He was good.  He played, like, this kind of fucking shitty, drunken neighbor who she had an affair with.  That never happened.  Holy shit.  They really had to punch up this fucking story.  This guy's life was a bore.  A bore.  They showed interaction.  There were certain things that did happen.  Like, you know, certain presidents.  Like, Jackie really did give him a tie.  That was one of JFK's after he was killed.  Like, there were certain things that happened which were...  Give us a fuck.  Was it stained?  Yeah, what did that one?  Did it have a hole in the neck?  Hopefully it is. 
[00:47:00]  I bet he sold it on eBay for $8.  Who cares?  Yeah, that's it.  And there were certain things that they just doctored for.  And they told the civil rights story through the eyes of...  They didn't need to do that.  No.  The radical son that they added...  Oh, they had two sons.  One son who became a Black Panther radical.  And another son who was killed in Vietnam.  That part was true.  The other son did go to Vietnam. 
[00:47:30]  Although he wasn't killed.  He did fine.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  That makes a huge difference.  Wait, you looked up all this stuff?  Sure did.  Good for you, Jimmy.  The opening...  Wow.  The opening is what kind of got me.  When he was a kid...  Because you realize...  The point of the movie, I think, is you realize where he came from and where he wound up.  Was that he was a kid.  He was raised on a farm.  Like, a cotton farm.  And that's true.  And his father...  Like, the guy who ran the farm, of course, was a white guy.  And would take the mother in the shed and rape her.  And then shot the father. 
[00:48:00]  When he questioned it.  The father was like...  You know, like...  He questioned this guy.  And the guy just stopped in the field in front of the son.  And shot and killed him.  Wow.  So that was where this guy came from.  Did that happen?  No, no.  Didn't happen at all.  Come on.  No way.  Nothing made it up.  So what was real about the movie?  He was born on a farm.  That he washed out some underwear?  For the president?  If you have a white guy shooting your father after raping your mom, it kind of sets the tone.  Yeah.  That never happened. 
[00:48:30]  What happened...  Oh, my God.  He was...  But that makes white people look damn shitty.  Oh, boy.  To add that part to the story.  I think that was a really accurate depiction of what happened to a lot of people.  If they just had said this is totally fiction, I would have been fine with it.  Right.  Because they were trying to tell a story...  There are people that think this is a true story.  That's what bothered me.  If you polled the people, I would bet 90% would think it was completely a real story.  The real guy's name is Eugene something, and this guy's name is Clarence something.  They changed the names, of course, to fictionalize. 
[00:49:00]  But why would you just call him by his real name?  What's the difference between those two names?  Because then it's got to be real.  It was such a departure.  Oh.  And the people that played the president...  Sam, can you find links of the guys that played the president?  John Cusack?  As Nixon?  And they were the worst...  And they said there was one thing I did not like that they did, was they showed Reagan  in office talking to, like...  And the butler would overhear a lot of shit.  Uh-huh.  That's just the reality.  Because they said, you know, the room should feel empty when you're in it. 
[00:49:30]  And that's probably a butler's thing.  People talk very freely.  So there's one scene where Reagan is talking to people in his own party, and they're talking  about South Africa and boycotting South Africa because of apartheid.  And Reagan is going, if you pass this, I will veto it.  And the woman's going, Mr. President, we're a part of your own party.  It was such an obvious political...  She goes, we're telling you this looks like a real racial issue.  And I'm like, wow, that made Reagan look kind of like a fucking racist old cunt.  And then you read about it, and they said one of the reasons behind this veto thing that 
[00:50:00]  was simplified by the movie is because apartheid, that was one of the few, I guess, African nations  that was pro-democracy and not communist.  And he was afraid a way of turning on the one place where communism wasn't.  It had something to do with that.  Yeah, that was pretty important back then.  That was a part of the equation.  Maybe the racial played a part of it for Reagan's decision, but that wasn't all of it.  And they just kind of simplified it in some cheesedick, typical Hollywood, shitty political  statement. 
[00:50:30]  Jesus.  So there was a lot about this movie.  I just...  Lyndon Johnson was the least offensive of them, but the guy that played Kennedy was really  handsome and sounded like him, but looked nothing like him.  Really?  Yeah, and the Reagan was awful.  And Robin Williams played Eisenhower, and I thought he was good.  Oh, Mike.  Yeah, it was so funny.  I like Ike.  But he really looked like...  I thought he did a great job as Eisenhower.  Yeah?  He was in it for like five minutes.  And he wasn't billed.  That guy played Kennedy? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, and Jackie looked great, but I didn't think that he looked like him.  James Marsden.  I hated Forrest Whitaker, and I hate to say that because I love him, but I didn't like  the accent he took to...  I just...  I didn't care about him.  Jefferson, that's a great butler trade.  You're keeping it up nicely.  Yeah, he fucking trashed the Kennedy limo, and they thought it was Oswald, but it was  just him over the tickets.  What a shit movie.  Really annoyed me.  Really.  I know they take license sometimes because like...  I remember them doing a story on the real guy, and it seemed like he just had a boring 
[00:51:30]  existence at the White House.  Yeah.  And then they turned it into this big, huge production.  Well, when you look at like Dallas Buyers Club, which McConaughey is winning so much  for, which he shouldn't.  He just played a fucking skinny guy.  Yeah.  He was a non-gay man with AIDS.  I thought that at least told his story accurately, and I'm happy to see Jared Leto being nominated  as the transsexual...  Nominated.  I think he's going to win the Oscar.  The character never existed, by the way.  But at least he's being, you know, he played it great. 
[00:52:00]  That character...  He's winning everything.  ...was completely made up.  Right.  It was a completely made up character just to show...  Jesus.  It was to try to like personify why this guy's...  Like his feelings about the gay community changed, and I guess they couldn't show that.  But again, that even annoys me.  It's like, don't act like you're telling me a real story when the entire guy that he  was with was made up.  Right.  Wow.  It wasn't...  It was a story about a guy who was, I guess...  Oh, the whole thing with the rodeo and the whole...  His involvement with the rodeo.  All that was made up.  It was like symbolic. 
[00:52:30]  It's just so fucking annoying the way that they...  They can't just tell a story...  No.  ...with little additions and subtractions to tell the story.  They have to make up these giant things to get their...  Because our lives are boring.  Because they have to give a narrative.  There's not a lot of people that have amazing lives.  Movie-worthy lives.  Right.  Exactly.  You've got to pump it up.  Punch that shit up.  I guess so.  We even pump shit up here for our stupid radio show.  Why wouldn't you?  We're not nominated for Oscars.  Give it a little extra.  Give it a little...  Give it a little...  A little nudge.  A little nudge.  I've done nothing but subtracting.  I've never punched up my sexual story. 
[00:53:00]  No.  I've subtracted.  No.  Believe me.  I've given you guys 70% of the humiliation.  There's 30% still lurking in a basement somewhere.  Boy.  We all assume that shit would be okay, right?  We're not stupid.  Who is that, Sam?  Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan?  Alan Rickman was Ronald...  Fucking Hans Gruber was fucking Reagan?  There you go.  I give you the FBI.  Well, I am not seeing the butler.  Yeah, I was disappointed.  I wanted to... 
[00:53:30]  Oprah was good.  I mean, she's a good actress.  And Forrest Griffin, and Forrest Whitaker didn't stink.  I didn't care for the way he played the character.  You've got to see the Osage County movie.  It's the last one, dude.  I've held out.  Please see it.  After I watch this, of course, I'm going to go home and watch the old Wall Street.  Where'd you get that?  A friend of mine sent it.  It's the TDK official copy.  Not a real screener copy, of course.  What is a TDK copy?  I don't even know. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, a TDK is just put onto a tape for me.  TDK, it's one of these jokers.  One of those where it's just printed up and written.  There's probably a head in it.  Nice.  But I want to see it because it's this...  I can't wait to see Wolf of Wall Street.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  We have that guy in today, by the way, who's being nominated.  What's his name?  Bakad Abdi.  He's the Somali lead pirate who's nominated for Best Supporting Role in Captain Phillips,  which was really good.  In the boat movie.  Yeah, in the boat movie. 
[00:54:30]  In the boat movie.  That fucker was good, man.  I knew it was going to be an Oscar-nominated movie when I said I want to see the boat movie.  We talked before.  You didn't see it, but Hanks was so good.  He was good in the movie, but the last...  Did you see it?  Yeah, yeah.  The last, say, ten minutes of the movie was Oscar-worthy.  Amazing.  And that's the way he had to play it.  He couldn't have done that shit earlier.  It wouldn't have been right.  No, and you'd have been like, oh, God, this captain's fucking losing us.  Man, was that good.  You forget Tom Hanks is great.  Yeah, he really is. 
[00:55:00]  He's ridiculous.  He's a national treasure.  I got it.  A national treasure.  He's one of our national treasures.  Oh, my God.  Of course he is.  Did Alan Rickman try to put on the Reagan voice?  Yeah.  He did?  Did he do a good job?  You know, Jane Fonda played Nancy pretty well, actually, briefly.  There's a lot of weird cameos.  My name's Bill.  Bill Clay.  Yes.  It's from Die Hard.  Oh.  No, you're one of them.  Don't kill me.  Yes.  Hello.  Look at him. 
[00:55:30]  I didn't think he was amazing as Reagan.  And I didn't think the guy who played.  Oily hair.  Dude, I didn't think that fucking, that Cusack was good as Nixon.  And they have him looking too young as Reagan.  Reagan never looked that young.  Yeah.  Can you find Cusack?  He was first in office.  Yeah, he was.  Cusack, did Cusack try to do the over-the-top Nixon?  He wasn't completely over-the-top, no.  But it was, they showed him coming in as the vice president or something when he was Eisenhower's VP.  And talking about the black guys, like, you boys going to vote for Jack Kennedy? 
[00:56:00]  And I'm like, who is he supposed to be?  Oh, you didn't even know who he was supposed to be?  I thought it was Spiro Agnew at first.  He was playing Nixon.  That's the oddest thing.  Was he playing him as the godfather of goth?  I remember how uncomfortable that moment was.  Remember we told everyone it was going down, too?  Yes.  I loved that.  And then he said it, and we all started laughing, and he knew something was up.  Yeah.  I do a great Nixon.  I should have done it.  These guys, when they promote a movie, they have the exact same thing they want to say to every interviewer. 
[00:56:30]  He wanted to get that out.  Right.  He wanted to make sure everyone knew that he was playing the godfather of goth when he was Edgar Allen Poe.  Yeah.  He was cool, though.  He was good.  I do a great Nixon.  I guess nobody heard me.  Oh, well, let me hear.  They heard.  Rawr!  That is good.  Yeah, they had really weird shit.  Weird fucking shit.  I think she just did it to get these weird names in the movie. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Robin Williams.  I didn't like the voice.  No, he was good.  He was the one who I actually thought was great.  That's odd.  We're stalling here because people hate when we eat on the air.  Where's the food?  I don't know, but I know I'm about to ask.  Uh-oh.  We actually don't have to say something tough, but doesn't it?  Trav, what's the story?  Trav, before you're quickly dismissed.  I was going to say if you guys want that godfather of goth clip.  Of course we do.  It's one of my favorites.  It's so uncomfortable.  That's Jimmy. 
[00:57:30]  Anthony, how you doing?  That's Opie.  What's up, John?  You don't have to worry about Sam Roberts right there.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, thanks, Sam.  That's all right.  I don't know.  Probably over the years.  Yeah, I think so.  I saw the Raven last night, and right off the bat.  We're actually on the air, by the way.  Yeah, we're on the air.  Yeah.  I know.  We just...  I'm sorry.  We're kind of casual here.  We're on the air.  I saw the Raven last night.  I loved it.  You liked it?  Period.  Yeah.  I really did.  Oh, great, man.  You play Edgar Allan Poe, obviously.  It's very iconic.  It's a murder mystery.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's shot very dark.  The cinematography's really good. 
[00:58:00]  And a lot of blood.  Yeah, well, he was the, you know, godfather of gods.  Oh!  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He started the whole godly horror thing.  He was right in all of his...  Right off the bat.  Because we said it was going to happen.  That's the lead-up.  We said he would start his interview by saying that.  Because I had seen, like, two or three interviews with him previously,  and every time he kept saying it and saying it, I'm like,  he's definitely going to say it when he comes in here.  Right. 
[00:58:30]  So I...  And then it was like, right when he sat his ass down,  he couldn't fucking wait.  Couldn't wait to get that one out there.  That little talking point.  I did like that movie.  Yeah?  Yeah, I haven't seen that.  I haven't seen it either.  I should get it on demand.  It's all right.  It didn't do well, but...  On the Netflix.  What's De Niro saying?  Devious.  You worried about him reading your emails or listening to your phone calls?  I'm not.  At all.  The NSA snooping, none of that gets on your nerves?  Oh, dude.  Oh, there's Sundance. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, look at Fox.  These fucking pussies won't even...  They will not even...  No.  Criticize Obama for that.  No.  These fucking pussy actors.  If that was...  If you were asking about Bush and the war,  they'd stand there for 10 minutes.  Uh-huh.  But if I had Obama,  oh, dude,  they'd just knock away.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  That was fucking cowards.  Oh, spying on your own people.  Oh, that's okay.  Oh, dude, I don't have an opinion on that.  Fucking cowards.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah.  Sundance.  There's one movie that was getting a little bit of buzz. 
[00:59:30]  Cooties.  Cooties?  Cooties.  I think Elijah Wood is in that or involved with it.  It's, I guess,  a bunch of, like, fifth graders or something become zombies.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you're getting a drug.  Everybody gets undressed and puts their arms out,  see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.  There you go.  Sure, sure.  It sounded like a good kind of premise.  It was a funny and, like, 
[01:00:00]  a good horror movie kind of a thing going on.  It's getting a lot of what they call a buzz over in Sundance.  I'm writing a movie about, um,  fucking, uh,  it's actually a TV series.  Oh, a TV series.  It's about a social studies teacher  who begins, like, fucking mixing crack  because he's got, like, fucking, um,  he's not,  he's, uh,  got MS  and he's making, like,  crack and selling it.  What?  That sounds kind of like breaking bad. 
[01:00:30]  No, it's not.  That was different.  That's methamphetamines.  He was a science teacher.  Mine's about a social studies teacher.  Oh, okay.  What's it called?  What's your working title?  He's selling crack.  You're going to have to pump up that title a little bit.  All right.  I guess we got to just take a break.  Oh, man.  That means the people get to hear us eat on the air because...  Yeah, stop popping your collar, Sal.  Oh, look at him full pop-collared, fucking bearded. 
[01:01:00]  What are you doing with that fucking...  Do you like Sal's popped collar?  I don't like it.  Why are you popping your collar?  That's just the way the sweater goes, like that.  That's a horrible sweater.  No, the sweater itself is just horrible.  Game of Thrones beard.  Better?  Yes.  I don't like your fucking robster.  I hope the same thing happens to you.  I hope you lay up on a dungeon floor with your cock sliced off.  Where'd you get that horrible sweater?  My girlfriend gave it to me.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So you got to wear it because she gave it to you?  Obligated.  That's understandable. 
[01:01:30]  I remember those days.  Oh, that's so adorable.  And by girlfriend, you mean what?  Boyfriend.  Ah, of course.  Welcome aboard.  What's the matter, Sam?  Did you check on our food?  Sam?  Let's get our food.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  This is a big delay.  There's been a breakdown.  Yep, there has been.  A breakdown in the organization.  Well, when the machine breaks down, we break down.  What happened?  Club City Kenny is nowhere to be found.  I'm assuming he's getting the food.  That's not...  Something's up.  Do you think he's freaking out right now? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Kenny...  Kenny's a robot.  Something's up.  He'll have a story.  I told Kenny to push my call time.  He pushed my stool in.  His fist?  To push my call time in the morning up.  Right.  And this morning...  I mean, by the second, he's right there.  Up from when to when?  With the call.  Earlier?  No, later.  Okay.  I'm like, fuck it.  Take a little more sleepy time.  How much time?  Squeeze a little extra.  Five minutes.  No, it is a good 20 minutes. 
[01:02:30]  I'm squeezing.  I squeeze 20 minutes.  Yeah, you keep squeezing, man.  I had to see how much leeway I had.  Right.  And there was kind of a lot of traffic this morning, but...  But it worked.  I was fine.  Good.  Good for you, man.  I'm getting there.  No, something's up.  Kenny's got a...  We'll have a story.  This is extremely unusual.  What, that he's not here?  I mean, he's here, but he's...  That he's not here with the food?  This is extremely unusual.  He's at...  The food would have been here a half hour ago.  Yeah.  What's probably happening is Kenny likes to go and queer off sometimes. 
[01:03:00]  I'll say, queer off.  Kenny would go in the bathroom and just bully his way into the stalls.  Let me see what you're holding down there.  He's trying to get one in?  Yeah.  He's trying to get one in.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, well...  Did anyone have any special orders?  No.  Something...  Special orders don't upset us.  All we ask is that you let us service your way.  Oh.  Kenny is beating the shit out of himself right now, and he'll have a story to tell after these messages.  Oh, I'm sure.  I will guarantee it.  But this is only after...  Yeah, no. 
[01:03:30]  You still got to...  Six days.  No, you're going to do...  You're doing more...  You're doing better than the average.  All right.  The only one I will be happy not to surpass is the Patrice one.  Any other one, I expect to trounce.  Ah.  The Patrice one is our number one podcast.  And then number two is actually the best of Bill Burr, beating out the best of Louis C.K.  Wow.  Look at that in the numbers.  That's our top three podcasts so far.  Patrice O'Neill, then the Bill Burr, then the Louis C.K. 
[01:04:00]  So let's pump up the numbers.  Let's get Jimmy up the charts a little bit, all right?  It's a great podcast, actually.  Jim Norton hates animals.  It's hilarious.  Thanks, man.  I've heard something I was actually enjoying.  It's weird.  You can listen to yourself when you remove it from a certain amount of time.  Like, oh, I didn't remember that.  And you just kind of hear it as a piece.  And then it was good.  And then tomorrow, I think the podcast is going to be the Jerry Springer slash Ice Cube interviews  because they were terrific, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  And then we're going to do a Bob Kelly Super Puke episode soon. 
[01:04:30]  Then we're going to do the Super Ball podcast, right?  Yep.  I think.  All right.  So, you know, it's kind of nice to know what we're going to put on the podcast in advance.  Indeed.  Instead of scrambling on a Monday afternoon going, fuck!  What did we put out there?  We're doing well in the podcast world.  It's pretty exciting.  So.  Yeah.  Thanks to everyone who subscribes to that.  And thanks to everyone who's passing that around to the people that can't, you know,  get the satellite radio anymore. 
[01:05:00]  The satellite radio is getting very expensive for a lot of people.  A lot of people.  I see you guys on Twitter.  I don't know what to say to you.  I got to drop you guys.  It's been nice.  Oh, man.  You know, it's been a great nine years.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Damn.  You know what you do?  Call up.  Call them up and say you have to cancel and stuff, and they'll give you, you know.  They'll throw you a deal.  Why don't you keep that on the QT?  Jesus.  You know, you could just, well, hopefully they'll help you out a little bit. 
[01:05:30]  I hope so, because we like our listeners.  Dude, this Richard Sherman rant was amazing.  Ah, yeah.  A big story over the weekend.  Ooh.  The 49ers-Seahawks game was amazing.  It was a great, great football game.  And at the end there, Richard Sherman made one hell of a play on Crabtree.  And these two guys don't really, they have a thing. 
[01:06:00]  They don't really like each other.  Travis, you know the history of the Crabtree-Richard Sherman thing?  They just talk shit.  Well, he said, he wrote an article on Sports Illustrated's website, I think.  Right.  Richard Sherman, saying that it goes back to something the Crabtree said in the offseason.  You'll have to ask him about that.  I don't know.  Right.  But they don't like each other.  But it went right down in the last play, and Richard Sherman, you know.  Smacked him down?  Smacked the ball.  Smacked the ball up in the air. 
[01:06:30]  Mm-hmm.  Causing an interception.  Game over.  The Seahawks go to the Super Bowl against the Broncos.  So he was a little excited.  He was a little excited.  What do you think of Aaron Andrews there, Travis?  I don't like her, man.  I just don't like her.  I thought it was funny as fuck when she was just like,  Whoa, who are you mad at?  Wait a minute.  She had a great face and a great reaction.  She was fucking...  That was like second to maybe when... 
[01:07:00]  Who said President Bush hates black people?  Kanye West.  Right.  What do you mean?  That was second to Mike Myers' face after Kanye said, President Bush hates black people.  And he made that face like, I'm not head nodding.  She was looking like this guy's ranting like, if anybody says...  She's like, who's saying that?  The best part, someone called her out on Twitter and said, man, you were scared.  And she was trying to say she wasn't scared. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  I don't know her exact tweet, but I don't know.  Aaron Andrews tends to try to make it a little bit more about herself when, look, you're just a stupid sideline reporter.  Yeah.  Relax and know your position.  I don't like her.  I don't know what it is.  I just don't like her.  But why was Mike Myers on the same stage as Kanye West?  I know.  It was a telethon.  It was the telethon they were doing.  But they just threw, like...  Yep.  They just threw, you know, what, random celebrities together? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Can you play this?  I know we're talking about Richard Sherman, but this is the best.  Man, this is after Katrina.  Right.  Look at Kanye.  With the breach of three levees protecting New Orleans, the landscape of the city has changed dramatically, tragically, and perhaps irreversibly.  It's all nice so far.  There's now over 25 feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighborhoods.  Can you pause this really fast?  There's a body language thing happening.  Look how far apart they are.  I know.  There's a problem.  And Mike Myers kind of starts looking over at Kanye like, uh-oh. 
[01:08:30]  He knows...  Something's not right here.  Like, Mike Myers is...  You know, he's a celebrity.  He's been in these positions many times, and he already feels the energy's not right and something is going to happen.  And he knows he can't be funny on this.  So he's got it.  He plays it very straight, very subdued.  And then his face and the way his head turns when Kanye goes off on his little...  In thriving neighborhoods. 
[01:09:00]  I hate the way they portray us in the media.  We see a black family.  It says they're looting.  See a white family.  It says they're looking for food.  And you know it's been five days because most of the people are black.  And even for me to complain about, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch.  I've even been shopping before even giving a donation.  So now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can get. 
[01:09:30]  Mike Myers is horrified.  And just imagine if I was down there and those are my people down there.  So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with the setup, the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible.  I mean, this is Red Cross is doing everything they can.  We already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war right now.  At this point, he just starts nodding. 
[01:10:00]  So you know a producer in his headset is going, just keep following the teleprompter.  He keeps looking at him like, what are you doing?  He looks at him.  This is a study in uncomfortability.  He is so uncomfortable standing there.  And it's Adam's out, but you can just see him going, gulp, gulp.  One time he just nervously nods.  Like, I better agree with whatever he's saying.  Is this guy going to shoot me?  The one thing Kanye said that he could agree with so far, it was really a mild thing, so he just nodded a little bit. 
[01:10:30]  But Mike Myers is like, oh my God, holy shit.  That's a holy shit face.  And they've given them permission to go down and shoot us.  Oh, no.  And subtlely in many ways more.  Now he's bumping his face.  The lasting damage to the survivor's will to rebuild and remain in the area.  The destruction of the spirit of the people of southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all.  George Bush doesn't care about black people. 
[01:11:00]  In the past few days.  They cut right away from him.  Mike Myers.  He looked like, what?  What?  Did they cut right away from him?  Yes.  Mike Myers hurt his neck.  He turned and looked like, did you just, his face is, did you just say that?  And then they just cut away.  I got to see that again.  Chris Tucker was not ready yet.  No, he wasn't.  This clip just doesn't get the credit it deserves.  Oh, this was fantastic.  It is so fucking funny to watch Mike Myers through the whole thing. 
[01:11:30]  First one, Mike Myers comes back after Kanye's first little tear there.  He comes back and he's, he's like looking like, well, I'm supposed to talk now and he's scratching his face.  He's just nervous.  Nervously, yeah.  But the best part, too, is obviously this was, it was, it was supposed to be a script.  It is a script in front of him.  Mike Myers does his part perfectly or whatever, reads it perfectly.  And then Kanye West goes off script.  But, you know, these guys are used to that a little bit. 
[01:12:00]  So, so Mike's like, okay, he's going off script.  You could read his mind like, oh, he's off script a little bit.  But then he's like, holy shit, he's really off script.  And holy fuck, what is this guy doing?  What's he saying?  Is he going to strangle me on live TV?  George Bush doesn't care about black people.  He quickly gets this in.  That face he makes.  Huh?  And shoot us.  Wait, go back.  And so, in many ways, more profoundly devastating is the lasting damage to the survivor's will to rebuild and remain in the area.  The destruction of the spirit of the people of southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all. 
[01:12:30]  George Bush doesn't care about black people.  He's ready to say something.  He's like.  That is so fucking good.  I think you can hear a little bit of him starting to say something.  They also probably said if he goes off book again, cut.  They were probably ready to cut if he did it again.  No, Mike Myers was done. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Mike Myers' part was done.  No, I mean from Kanye.  The producers in the price.  And I think Kanye's part was done, too.  He's like, if he starts yapping about anything, just fucking.  Oh, one more time.  Mike Myers just turns his head around like, dude, what the fuck?  You're going to get me fucking in trouble here.  You've got to put this up so people can see.  The face is so classic.  Mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all.  George Bush doesn't care about black people. 
[01:13:30]  Please call.  Didn't it sound like Mike Myers was going to say something?  Yeah, it looked like it.  You can hear him say, please call.  And there's obviously somebody in his headset going, no, we're not doing this anymore.  Who's saying please call?  Mike Myers.  Mike Myers probably felt like, I've got to say something here because I'm associated with this.  I don't want people to think that I think that George Bush doesn't like black people.  Oof.  That was good.  That is an amazing clip. 
[01:14:00]  That was good.  That is just, oh, Mike Myers.  I wish he was the type of guy you could ask about that, you know?  Like he's such a.  He was a bit of a boring interview.  He is a boring interview.  Yes, and we had to go over the top for him, remember?  We had to, like, have a whole green room with all sorts of shit.  It was for that horrible guru movie.  Yeah.  And, you know, he had a specific writer and all this stuff we had to get, and then it  turns out he didn't even fucking have any of it. 
[01:14:30]  No.  He was all right, though, on the show.  He was a bore.  He was all right, though.  He was nice, but he was just boring as all fuck.  Like, it was pretty dull.  You would think, you know, he was going to be a little more dynamic than he was.  Right.  That fucking guru movie was so bad.  Oh.  Oh.  Dude, that clip is just.  Mike Myers looks like he's being held hostage.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  Like he's in North Korea or something, and he just knows he has to do this thing. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, holy fuck.  That is.  Oh, my God.  And Mike's like, what are you getting me into, man?  I'm just trying to give my time for a good cause.  What are you doing?  Fucking great.  And then Kanye coming back.  George Bush doesn't like black people.  Doesn't care about black people.  Because after he was done with his initial rant, which nobody could tell when it was ending,  Mike Myers was probably like, okay, out of the woods. 
[01:15:30]  The worst part's over.  I'll just finish the teleprompter.  Teleprompter.  I'll finish what's written there.  I'll say the number, and we'll.  Oh, no.  What's he saying?  Oh, no.  Not again.  Oh, this is much worse.  I love it.  It really is some good shit.  Hold on a minute.  We got someone that has a question here.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's me.  It's Lady Di.  How's everything?  Oh, God.  How you doing?  I dreamt about her last night.  Did you really?  Wet dream?  No, I dreamt about Lady Di that me and Kenny went to some kind of, 
[01:16:00]  event like you were having, and no one had showed up for it?  Wait, wait, wait.  Is this Jim Norton?  Yes.  I know.  It's surprising to hear me here.  Why would I be on the radio?  Doesn't she say that every time?  Who do you think was talking?  Jim Norton, right?  Yes.  Very good.  Okay, very good.  Well, I'm saying I had a dream about you last night that it was some kind of a weird event, 
[01:16:30]  and you were there, and you'd have to walk into this.  It was indoors, but there was an area of a tent, and you'd have to walk through,  and there was like the Lady Di story, but no one had showed up,  and we were trying to figure out why no one had showed up.  I swear.  Oh, my God.  And I wound up, this is true.  Before I went to bed, I sharted, and I didn't get any on my pants,  but I sharted before I went to bed, so I had to swipe out my asshole.  Hold on a second.  And then while my dream is this, and then I dreamt that my manager, Jonathan, was there,  and then Jonathan and I went to a rest stop, and when Jonathan took a shit, 
[01:17:00]  he got shit all over his shirt, and he's holding up his shirt because he had rolled.  Oh, my God.  Why am I mad that this dummy can't do radio?  She can't.  And then he had shit on the front of his white shirt.  On the front?  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  That was the weirdest dream.  Wow, that is odd.  Yeah.  Thank you for reminding me of the dream of my manager shitting on his shirt.  Go ahead.  Now it's your turn.  What do you want, Lady Dye?  Please.  All right.  All right.  Listen, I was just thinking last week.  All right. 
[01:17:30]  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Like, Howard Stern made a movie a long time ago, that movie Private Park.  That was a Howard Stern movie?  I heard about that.  What was it about?  Well, it was about Howard Stern, obviously.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Oh.  But wait, wait, wait.  How many Natty Ices have you had so far?  Do you really want to know?  Yeah.  Two.  It's eight o'clock.  It's eight in the morning.  What time did you get up?  Actually, I was up to the six o'clock.  Did you crack one right when you woke up?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:18:00]  No, I just.  Oh, that would be crazy.  I would just lay.  No, I just laid there and, you know, relaxed a little bit.  And around seven o'clock, that's when I woke up.  And then you popped your Natty Ice?  Yeah.  Now, I was.  Just listen to me.  I was just.  Why are you up so early?  Yeah.  I'm always up early.  Why?  Why am I up early?  Ask the question.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  You want to play today?  You guys want to play today?  I do. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  All right.  Keep track.  The bell every time she answers a question with a question.  Wait a minute.  You're not letting me finish.  And then let's go with the ridiculous.  We are not letting her finish.  We're not letting you finish.  You've been talking for six and a half hours already.  Jesus.  All right.  Six and a half hours.  What are you talking about?  That's two bells.  It's a question with a question, and it's literal.  Okay, cool.  You need the beer.  Shut up, you.  Who's that guy?  That's my roommate.  A lover spat?  Wait.  Can we talk to him for a second? 
[01:19:00]  Can we talk to him for a second?  No, no, no, no.  Can we talk to him for a second?  What's your roommate like a robot?  Can we talk to him for a second?  Yeah.  What is your roommate a robot?  No, he's not a robot.  Okay.  Now, yeah, but how come you're.  Well, who are you living with?  Matthew McConaughey?  He's not Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey.  So, why is he saying you need a beer or something?  What do you have him, hanging upside down like a bat?  No.  Okay, good.  Thanks.  All right, go ahead.  So, why was he saying you need a beer? 
[01:19:30]  Because he was just asking, do I need a beer?  Oh, he's asking if you want.  He should know.  You've already had the 1,800 this morning.  I did not.  7 o'clock in the morning, you need the beer.  Ah, see, he's yelling 7 o'clock in the morning, you need a beer.  The background.  Who is that, Barack Obama in the background?  No, it's not Barack Obama.  Oh, we thought it might be.  All right, go ahead.  Can we talk to that guy?  No.  The hostage?  Wait, listen to me. 
[01:20:00]  Uh-huh.  Sorry.  All right, now, I was thinking, you guys have been on the air for a long time.  You were in Boston a long time ago.  Lady Di.  I was just...  Lady Di.  What?  Can we talk to that guy for a second, please?  No, no, you can't.  All right, then we're going to hang up on you.  No, you're not.  Just for one minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Thank you.  And then we'll get to what you want to talk about.  Bill, they're going to talk to you.  Yeah, I don't know.  All right, hold on. 
[01:20:30]  Who's that, Bill, the mayor of New York?  What?  Bill de Blasio?  You live with the mayor of New York?  Say that one more time.  That's Bill de Blasio?  You live with the mayor of New York?  Holy shit.  No, I don't.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't live with no mayor.  Oh, okay.  Hold on, hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, you fucking moats.  Jesus Christ.  Lomocks.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Mr. Koo, what's up?  What is the deal with Di and the beers this early in the morning? 
[01:21:00]  Sir?  Bill?  It's called alcoholism.  Yeah, huh?  Do you join her in a little cocktail this early?  Excuse me?  Do you join her in having a little cocktail this early in the morning?  Oh, I do.  Every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no. 
[01:21:30]  I get up early like I'm going to work and, you know, I'm retired.  I got a lot of money and I drink so much coffee.  I get coffee down and I'll sit down and have a beer.  Nice.  Nothing wrong with that, sir.  How do you know a lady died, Bill?  Oh, excuse me?  How do you know a lady died?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You want to hear it?  You want to tell you what?  We do.  Yeah, please.  I'm going to make your ratings go fucking sky high. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, nice.  Let's hear this.  I want 5% of your ratings.  Sure.  Sounds great to me.  How do you know a lady died?  No, I tell you, I want 5% of your ratings.  Okay, you can have 5% of our ratings.  Right.  Yeah.  They're going there, I think, in February.  Yeah.  And I tell you what, I ain't signing no piece of paper that I'm going there for nothing.  You're not going to be on the air.  Okay?  Oh, you're coming in in February. 
[01:22:30]  That's great.  Okay, great.  How do you know Lady Di?  No, I ain't going to say nothing for nothing.  How do you know her?  How do you know Diana?  All right, fine.  All right.  Oh, me and my buddy.  Jeff.  Jeff?  Well, the ratings are going sky high.  You're right.  Absolutely.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Just listen.  They don't listen, Bill.  They better listen to me.  They don't want to be in trouble with me.  We're listening, Bill.  We're listening, Bill.  We don't tangle with you, Bill. 
[01:23:00]  Beats, Lady Di.  I'm bloody Jeff.  There's a bar.  Hmm.  Figures.  They've got a laundromat right behind it.  It used to be a pizza parlor.  Really turned them into a laundromat.  Me and my buddy were down Jeff and washed her clothes.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Okay.  And we're drinking.  We're not drunk or nothing.  We just haven't a couple of beers.  Sure.  And met her.  Would she come up to you guys at the bar? 
[01:23:30]  No, I went up to her.  That's the first thing I said.  I said, you have a drink.  No, something like that.  I don't know.  So, anyway.  Now, what did you say to her when you walked up?  Did you put a quarter in and try to ride her?  See how long you can hold on?  Say what?  Barfly.  Well, what did you say when you walked up to her?  No, I just walked up to her.  I said, we were drinking beer.  I said, no, I wore the clothes.  He held the sugar cube out in a flat hand.  No, no, no. 
[01:24:00]  I gave her 10 bucks for all my clothes.  10 bucks to fold your clothes?  Yeah.  That's a bargain.  That's a hell of a story.  Yeah, whatever.  Did she take it?  Oh, hell yeah.  Heck yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  So, I keep folding her clothes and then we came back in the bar.  You know, I bought her a couple of drinks.  I was getting late.  And me and my buddy, we always go out to dinner.  So, I invited her out to dinner. 
[01:24:30]  We went to this restaurant that was called Pinocchio's.  You're lying.  Good one.  Good one.  No, because a lion Pinocchio, your nose is growing.  You won't believe this.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You won't believe this.  Oh.  No, this place is called Pinocchio's.  Okay.  It's a very famous steakhouse in an Italian restaurant.  Okay.  She was on the sign?  Right.  It's a famous Pinocchio. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, come on.  Wouldn't believe it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Anyway.  He's hammered.  I thought he actually had an unbelievable story.  I'm starting to think he might not have an unbelievable story.  Yeah, is this gearing up to be that?  Where's the ratings grabbing story?  Yeah.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Don't goof on me.  No, I'm saying where's the ratings grabbing story you said you had?  Yeah, you said we're not going to believe it.  This isn't a very good story.  This is true, because I don't lie.  I think it's great so far. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not saying it's a lie.  I'm just saying it's a very mundane kind of story.  I thought you had an exciting story that was going to get us ratings.  This is not exciting?  Yeah, it is.  I love it.  He's gearing up.  Go ahead.  The laundromat, the bar, you walk in.  This is not exciting?  Please.  The folding the clothes, the exciting folding the clothes segment.  Absolutely.  That bar was pretty exciting.  Home run so far.  Yep.  Do you want to hear really something funny?  Yeah.  Hey, my buddy Jeff, he's another alcoholic. 
[01:26:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is fucking funny.  Yeah?  I was starting to wish the lady died to come back on the phone.  Oh, my God.  And then what happened?  I wrote on my steak and muscles, okay?  Yeah.  And Jeff is all messed up.  He goes, Jeff goes, we're going to poke Pinocchios.  I said, yeah.  Oh, back to Pinocchios. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm waiting.  He's going to poke outside in the back.  This is what the cop hears before he slaps the cuffs on.  Yeah, no, no, no.  There's clowns and everything there.  It's like a little circus.  Uh-huh.  He leaves the table, walks out in the backyard, gone for like 15, 20 minutes.  What was he doing?  Looking for the circus.  Oh, boy.  Good stuff.  Come on, Adam. 
[01:27:00]  That's crazy.  Good stuff.  No, that's how funny I am.  But that's real though.  Holy fuck.  He left.  Then he comes back down and sits at the table.  Oh, it goes on.  He goes, no, I haven't seen those circus back there.  No, really.  Come on.  He said that to you?  Yeah, there's no circus.  Ah, come on, Bill.  He said to you, come back, I don't see no circus in there and you don't keep, how do you keep a straight face? 
[01:27:30]  Say what?  How do you not laugh when he says that?  I'd have been cracking up all over the damn place.  I did.  I was telling all over the place, I couldn't even eat.  I'm laughing.  Oh, yeah, come on.  No, isn't it true?  Give us another one.  Come on, that's not true.  The guy goes on, he comes back.  This Jeff, where is this guy?  What's he doing? 
[01:28:00]  He what?  He couldn't find a circus.  Good story.  Oh, even better than a second time.  Oh, this Jeff, what's this guy doing?  Just wait, Diana, get out of my face.  Speaking of circuses, yeah.  Oh, God.  I told him that.  The projects, that's what was back there.  No, it wasn't.  It was not back there.  Diana, sit down, you're drinking.  Backhand her.  Sit down, you're drinking.  Sit down, you're drinking.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:28:30]  Tell her to stop standing up.  Did you ever have to hit Diana?  Did you ever have to hit her?  No.  Have you ever wanted to?  Did you ever have to shake her?  Yeah.  No.  Wait, so why is she living with you, Bill?  Because she'd do me a big favor.  What'd she do?  None of your business.  Oh, come on, Bill.  What could she possibly do?  I can't say this.  Does she suck on your wee-wee? 
[01:29:00]  What?  Does she suck on your wee-wee, you pecker?  No.  Fudge, yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I'm still married.  I don't cheat on my wife.  I'm still married.  What?  Where's your wife?  Huh?  Where's your wife?  My wife?  Oh, she's living with her mother.  Why, if you're still married?  Yeah, by the law, but we don't live together.  Oh, what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I don't want to talk about that. 
[01:29:30]  There's nothing in your business with my wife.  Well.  Well, me and Diana, you...  No, no, excuse me.  Me and Diana, you want to know something, but I'm not saying anything with my wife.  My wife is not involved in this type of situation.  Sure.  Okay.  So we're not alone.  I didn't say she was.  Yeah, Diana said that.  I was saying...  Diana said that...  What?  Yeah, Diana said that you two have sex, though.  We do what?  That you two have sexual intercourse. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, she said she gives you oral sex and stuff.  Yeah.  You gotta be...  She said she puts you on all fours and eats your dumper.  Yeah.  That's the fucking biggest joke I've ever heard of my wife.  That's the reason why I'm laughing.  Bill, you don't want to have sex with Lady Di?  No.  Why?  I can't say. 
[01:30:30]  Because she's fat?  Oh, hey, you got one reason.  Give me another.  She's homely?  She's what?  Homely.  She's a little ugly.  Yeah, right?  Just say yes or no.  She can't hear you.  I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  Uh, don't ask me.  You answer that question in your own mind.  No, I think we got it figured out, Bill. 
[01:31:00]  And she's too drunk?  Oh, you can answer that question, too, in your own mind.  That's a yes.  Yeah.  She's a slovenly sloppy monster.  I love this guy.  This guy's all right.  He's all right, man.  Hey, Bill, does she go out and look for work often enough, do you think?  Does she what?  Do you think she looks for work often enough?  Oh, yeah, she's been looking. 
[01:31:30]  I know, and she's just having a hard time.  Yeah.  Ten years.  Yeah.  Well, I tell you what, I can't say this over the air.  Yeah.  No, I can't.  But what?  You want me to tell you the reason why?  Why?  You guys don't know?  You're so friggin' smart, you don't have, you ain't got enough brains or enough.  No, we don't.  Tell us.  Yeah, tell us.  Enlighten us.  Enlighten us. 
[01:32:00]  You ain't got no common sense?  No, tell us.  None.  None whatsoever.  Well, let me think a minute.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Who owns the 7-Elevens?  I don't know.  Who owns the 7-Elevens?  Indians?  Yeah.  Fine, you say it.  I'm not saying it.  All right.  The Indians, I guess.  So what is...  No, no, no, no.  Oh, I know what he's saying.  Bill, you're saying who runs 7-Elevens?  The Jews, right?  No. 
[01:32:30]  No.  Come on, Bill.  The Pakistanis.  Who?  Come on, Bill.  No, no.  You guys could just suffer in trouble, aren't you?  Well, we just said it.  So what's your point, though, about the...  Yeah.  Okay, fine.  Who owns the gas stations?  The Middle Easterns, yeah.  The Pakistanis or Indians.  Yeah, okay.  Who owns subways?  Same thing.  So what's your point? 
[01:33:00]  My point is she's American.  They don't hire Americans.  Oh, no.  Shit.  The damn Jews, right, Bill?  The red, white, and blue.  Bill, you're a racist.  I'm not a racist.  No, I'm not.  I hear your new voice.  I think they're not hiring her because she's a drunk.  No, no, no, no, no.  No?  No, I was a head mechanic and I had...  No, no, no.  No, man.  Shut up, Diana.  Thank you.  You spoke for the entire audience.  I don't think it's time to make a movie. 
[01:33:30]  What's this movie we...  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine...  Let's get Lady Di back in the phone.  ...being in this fucking apartment listening to this.  Broadcasters and stuff.  They can make a movie about that.  Tell her to shut up.  Come on, Bill.  Toughen up a little.  Backhander, Bill.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Front-hander.  Shut up.  Go back and drink your beer.  Tell her to go back and shit in her own hat, Bill. 
[01:34:00]  Get out of here.  Yeah, get out of here, you fucking lummox.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sot.  Anyway, I'm not.  I'm on this...  I don't...  Whatever.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, get out of here, piggy.  Whatever.  I was a head mechanic for a big corporation.  Oh.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  I made a lot of money.  Fuck, yeah.  I had 57 varieties of mechanics.  And I'm not righteous.  I'm not prejudiced. 
[01:34:30]  Whatever it is.  I never...  I was never brought up that way.  Oh.  Sure.  So what is it about the Jews and blacks that bothers you, though?  Excuse me?  What is it about the Jews and blacks that bothers you?  I mean, we know you're not prejudiced, but what is it about those, you know, two groups  that bother you?  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, it really tells you truth.  Nothing bothers me.  Oh, all right.  Wow.  I like this guy.  I care less.  How about that?  I care less.  Nothing bothers me.  Well, God.  The only thing that bothers me, you step on my toes. 
[01:35:00]  Uh-oh.  Especially if it's your roommate that does it.  Yeah.  You fucking chop your foot off.  Flatten them out.  Yeah.  What the problem is, if somebody steps on my toes, I'm going to step a lot bigger back  on you.  Oh, you're a tough guy, huh?  There's a toes being stepped on.  You're a tough guy.  No, I just, my father brought me up that way.  Racist?  When you're right, when you're wrong, you're wrong.  Uh-huh.  When you're right, you stick up for yourself.  When you're wrong, you admit that you're wrong. 
[01:35:30]  Boring.  Exactly.  All this morning, so you want me to break the guy's face or something that should never  be done?  Boring.  Something tells me it wasn't a coffee morning for Bill.  Me and I have my coffee.  I'm drinking coffee now.  Be more funny.  Don't lie.  Oh, don't lie.  What are you having, whiskey?  I don't drink whiskey.  What are you drinking in your coffee? 
[01:36:00]  Eight o'clock coffee.  What do you got in there?  What booze are you drinking today?  I don't drink no booze.  Never did.  You having beers?  Excuse me?  You having a couple of beers this morning?  Oh, one.  Hmm.  All right, should we get Lady Di back on the phone?  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Thanks, Bill.  Hey, hey, hey.  You guys, you know, we had guys at work to listen to you.  Oh.  They listen to Howard Stern and everything. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, right.  You want to hear something funny?  Sure.  To gunshots.  All right.  Howard Stern is Goldilocks.  Fuck, yeah.  That's funny.  Home run Bill.  And he had such a beautiful life, and you ain't saying nothing to me that he wasn't cheating on you because... 
[01:37:00]  That's a white thing.  Yeah, Allison.  Like you said, he never did that.  I tell you what, with his Goldilocks hair.  Yeah.  Ah, Bill.  I bet Jeff said that.  Is that it?  Holy fuck.  Is that it?  I actually missed the Enchantress.  Yes.  Where is Lady Di?  Can we ask Lady Di a question?  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Thanks.  He's doing to Lady Di.  Goodbye, Bill.  Put Di on the phone.  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah, put Di on.  There you go.  Good job.  Good job, Bill.  Good stories.  You guys think it's been quite a yarn.  Ratings went up, too.  Yeah.  He was right.  He was right.  We've got to give him five ratings points.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Hey, Di, that was...  Are you there?  I'm right here, yeah.  That was quite a while.  What, did you take a bus to California and back?  No, you guys were talking. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, no.  Of course not.  Get into the list.  I'm like, well, what do you think?  What do you think about my idea?  What idea?  If it's starting the car and closing all the windows.  Yeah.  The garage.  Yeah.  We're in.  About you guys making a movie.  That's not your idea.  Exactly.  That's no one's idea.  How is that your idea?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I thought it was a good idea.  It's not your idea.  I didn't track all the characters and stuff like that. 
[01:38:30]  That's true.  Yeah.  And you've been on the air for a long time.  Who would play your part?  Who do you think would play Lady Di?  Burt Reynolds?  Dom DeLuise.  The characters would play their original part.  Okay.  Good one.  Okay.  Fair question.  So you would want to play yourself?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Well, you're not an actress.  And why would you be in our movie?  Exactly.  As what?  What are you talking about?  Well, all right.  I'm known as Lady Di from the show, right? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but why would you be in our movie?  Marion's known as Marion.  And Stalker Patty is known as Stalker Patty.  You're going to go through everybody?  Yeah, mention more people.  And you want me to go through everybody?  Please do, yes.  What about all the comedians?  Okay, you didn't mention them.  Yeah.  Well, it's something to think about.  So what would you do in the movie?  What would be a good part that would showcase Lady Di?  What would I do in the movie except be myself?  But what is that? 
[01:39:30]  What part?  Like, give me a little scenario of you in the movie.  Go.  The scenario of me in the movie.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Think of something you've done that happened that would be exciting enough in a movie.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, do your scene.  Do your scene.  Go ahead.  Wait a minute.  I would flash my boobs.  Okay.  Okay.  Boobs.  Great.  It's a horror film. 
[01:40:00]  Insidious 3.  Return of the Drunken Beast.  Sorry.  Get drunk on the show, you know.  Oh, that's sweet.  And do what?  What'd you say?  Get drunk on the show.  Okay.  Get drunk on the show.  And let's see.  What else?  What else?  Just be myself.  That's all.  We probably could get Jonah Hill to play you.  Jonah Hill.  Jonah Hill.  Who's that?  Oh, okay.  Or Michael Moore.  Anything.  Michael Moore. 
[01:40:30]  A guy to play my part?  Yeah.  Well.  Well, that's what we're getting at.  Yeah.  You don't have a hint of femininity in you.  Not at all.  You beast.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Lady Di, how about we reenact for the movie the time where you squirted some kind of liquid  out of your vagina when you were standing here?  When I had to go to the bathroom?  Well, no.  No, you came.  No, you had a discharge, remember?  Remember you had a discharge?  Looked like something off a cake boss. 
[01:41:00]  That was absolutely nothing.  I was just afraid that I had my you-know-what again.  What's your new one?  You-know-what.  Yeah, what is that?  You-know-what.  My period.  I thought I had it again.  Oh, my God.  Awful.  When did you stop having it?  Smells like she has a fucking pot of pennies in her underwear.  No, seriously, about a year ago.  A year, huh?  You went through the change?  A Natty Ice period flow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yay.  How awful.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you thought it was your period, but it wasn't.  You actually orgasmed because you were so excited to be up here. 
[01:41:30]  I actually orgasmed?  If you want to call it that, go ahead.  Oh, what was it?  Call it that.  No, it was just a clear discharge.  That's all it was.  A clear discharge.  Yeah.  Well, that's because it's been a while since I've been on your show and everything like  that, and I said, uh-oh, and I thought it was, I actually thought it was my period  starting up again.  So you came in your pants because you were so happy to be on the radio?  Sure. 
[01:42:00]  Holy fuck.  You're getting nauseous.  I like your enthusiasm.  You want to call it that?  Yeah.  You thought you were getting your period again, even though you don't get your period anymore?  You are a dunce.  Yeah.  I thought those ovaries fucking came back to life.  It smelled like somebody was writing, happy birthday with dental plaque.  Oh, yeah.  More much, I didn't have my friends.  More much, I didn't have my period.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, I got it again.  Your pussy must just fucking stink. 
[01:42:30]  All that stuff that's supposed to happen in there to keep it clean.  Right.  Yeah.  Moist.  Right.  Exactly.  Self-cleaning?  Yeah, it's self-cleaning the vagina, but some of the self-cleaning properties shut down.  Yeah, your vagina isn't self-cleaning anymore.  How did you know that your period was done?  I get checkups all the time, so.  Yeah.  Probably Bill when he's looking for his keys.  I feel bad for that.  Your shoes?  I feel bad for that, gynecologist.  Can you imagine being the gynecologist that has to look at Lady Di's snatch? 
[01:43:00]  Fake sickness every time you know it's her appointment day.  Right.  Yeah.  She's not used to being told herself to put her feet in the stirrups.  She's got to wear a hockey mask.  It's the guy on the saddle.  Seriously, everything was okay that day.  Everything was okay that day, okay?  Yeah.  Tommy, everything was okay.  Oh, my God.  How did you know your period was done, though?  Like, what tells you the kid is no more?  What tells you?  Yeah.  All right, all right. 
[01:43:30]  Now, this is what tells you.  You just don't get it anymore.  Okay.  And you didn't have any sex, so you're not pregnant.  But there's other side effects to not getting a period anymore, right?  Right.  Well, you do gain a little bit of weight.  A little.  A little.  Holy shit.  How many periods aren't you getting?  I haven't had it in a year.  Come on.  What?  I did a little math joke for everybody.  I have not had it in a year.  You have hot flashes? 
[01:44:00]  I used to, yeah.  You used to.  That's one of the things.  Lady Di, I heard your pussy was as big as the Holland Tunnel.  Oh, boy.  No, it ain't.  Oh, I know.  It's the Lincoln Tunnel.  Oh, it was the Lincoln Tunnel?  No, it ain't.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, it's the tunnel that connects England and France.  The Tunnel.  No, it ain't.  It ain't.  No, it ain't.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di.  What?  When was the last time you had anything inside your vagina? 
[01:44:30]  Oh, boy.  Let me think.  Yes.  The last time I went to the, wait a minute, hold on.  I don't know, around four months ago.  Oof.  The last time she went to the Carnegie Deli, she stole a bunch of salamis.  What was in your vagina four months ago?  Pap smear testing.  Oh, fucking awful.  Pap smear.  The paint roller. 
[01:45:00]  What's the last thing?  It was like.  Could you just imagine what that smidge would look like?  Oh, that's true.  We misheard it.  What?  She said papst beer.  Oh.  Oh, you had papst beer in your pussy?  She stole a case.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  That's the last thing I had in my vagina.  That's what you want to know.  What was the last fleshy living thing you had in your vagina? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  About four or five years ago right now.  Wow.  And who was that?  The guy that stepped in front of the choo-choo?  No.  No.  Somebody else.  Oh.  Who was it?  Who was it?  Somebody else.  Who was it?  Where'd you meet him?  I don't know.  It doesn't make any difference.  Where'd he go?  Where did he go?  How did he kill himself?  Nobody killed himself.  Where did he go?  Why don't you see him anymore?  Yeah.  I don't see him anymore. 
[01:46:00]  I don't see this person anymore because I have no desire to see him anymore.  Why?  He wasn't a good fuck?  Did he get sober?  I don't know what he's doing right now.  Oh.  Why did you hook up with him?  Yeah.  How'd you hook up?  You had to pay your cable bill.  Somebody tried to fix me up with him.  Marion?  Yeah.  What do you mean someone tried?  You fucked him.  I was Marion.  It was not Marion.  Don't blame Marion.  Was it just one date?  Yeah.  You gave it up on the first date?  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  You're a trooper.  Will you listen to me?  Yeah.  Sorry.  You slut.  One date lasted three days.  What?  One date lasted three days?  It's called a bender.  Yeah.  Right.  Matter of fact, it had to be over four years ago.  Uh-huh.  Well, five years would be over four years ago.  Sure.  Yeah.  Right.  It had to be over four years ago because we were not even living here back then.  We were living in another...  Fascinating.  Outdoors.  Uh-huh. 
[01:47:00]  So you had sex with him the first time you met him?  Are you like that?  You're that kind of girl?  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  Dominic is here.  Dominic.  Who's Dominic?  Never mind.  Who's Dominic?  Who's Dominic?  Our landlord.  I mean, not our landlord.  Our super.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  What does he want, do you think?  Is Bill in trouble for having wildlife in the house?  Oh, no. 
[01:47:30]  The no-pets policy is getting Bill in trouble.  You have a pet cow.  What, do you got to pay the old rent with a gulp and a burp?  But anyway, anyway.  Okay.  Why is Dominic there?  He's walking outside.  It's the super across the way.  Look, jerky.  He's walking outside.  All right.  Why did you call Bill and tell him that Dominic's, was he wheelchair-bound yesterday? 
[01:48:00]  No, he knows.  I just told him.  Okay.  Why do you care?  Why is this such an alert?  Yeah.  Why is it a big deal that Dominic's there?  You're behind on the rent?  No.  A little bit?  We just paid the rent yesterday.  So what's the problem with Dominic?  I don't know what the problem is.  I got money.  I don't worry about what he is.  Yeah, he has money.  He doesn't worry about that stuff.  Of course.  All right, listen, guys. 
[01:48:30]  You got to let me go.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  All right.  We got to go.  The movie.  Movie idea.  We got to go.  Yeah, we get the whole thing about the movie.  Bye, honey.  Bye, honey.  Bye.  Bye.  Honey.  A bear talking about honey.  She's got bees stinging while we're talking.  Her snout.  Jeez, what a nightmare.  Holy shit.  Could you imagine being in that house?  Oh my God, no.  Just two babbling idiots. 
[01:49:00]  Just yapping.  Although Bill was all right.  Bill was fucking hammered.  But he was all right.  He was telling his boring stories.  You didn't think it was a good story, Ant?  He tells, no.  No.  He just died to shut up, which I like.  I like that part.  Yeah.  Where's Sam?  We got to read the list.  Young Sam.  Yeah, we also, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That whole thing.  The apology.  Yeah.  It's the perpetual apology.  Yeah, fucking Richard Sherman.  We're going to get into the whole Richard Sherman thing after the break. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I got to play the clip.  And of course he apologized.  Of course.  All right.  I don't blame him, but of course he apologized.  What was the list?  What did we get out of Lady Di?  Well, we learned a lot about it today.  These were questions that she answered like they were legit.  In all sincerity, we found out that she had not been talking for six and a half hours,  three minutes into the conversation.  Right.  Her roommate is not a robot.  Okay. 
[01:50:00]  I was wondering about that for so long.  Her roommate is not Matthew McConaughey.  Okay.  Her roommate does not stand upside down like a bat.  She answered all these.  That's legit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She didn't drink 1,800 beers this morning.  1,800.  All right.  She doesn't live with Barack Obama.  Okay. 
[01:50:30]  Now here's a tricky one.  Oh.  She lives with a guy named Bill, but he's not Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City.  Oh.  See, I missed that part.  I'm glad I got the answer to that.  While we were talking to her roommate, she didn't take a bus to California and back.  And finally, we found out that her pussy is not as big as the Lincoln or Holland Tunnels 
[01:51:00]  or the Chunnel.  Or the Chunnel.  Right.  Wow.  That's great.  We got the facts today.  She always enlightens us.  Which she answered all those questions seriously.  Of course.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Not the best lady die phone call, but we get a little more back story.  She lives with Bill, got to speak to Bill and Dominic the super.  And Bill also seems to be suffering from alcoholism. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Well, he says he doesn't really drink, though.  Well, he sounded like he might.  He sounded pretty wasted.  Yeah.  Could you imagine that lady die?  It's 8 in the morning.  Well, now it's later, but I mean, we took her call around 810.  She was already two beers in at 810 in the morning.  That pudgy face of hers trying to put on her bedroom eyes.  Oh, God.  The perpetual Dintymore stew stain in the toilet.  Just rust stains.  From her poo just wearing away the porcelain. 
[01:52:00]  It's always liquidy, too.  Oh, yeah.  Always.  You think she has healthy bowel movement?  No, it's always a drunken beer shift.  Oh, how many times in front of the bathroom do you think Bill hears, Bill, I need some TP.  Some more TP.  They're just constantly yelling to get more toilet paper.  Oh, yeah, more toilet paper.  Yeah.  Need to wipe more.  Yeah.  What a disaster.  God, I would give anything to walk through that house.  You probably could if you just wanted to.  We should walk through that house. 
[01:52:30]  Sure.  Jesus.  What the hell's going on over there?  Finally bring back cribs.  Yeah.  We could do that.  Yeah.  Stalls.  Worse.  All right.  We were gearing up to talk about Richard Sherman.  We'll do that next, including some of the other great rants from other celebrities.  Ooh.  And we'll do the Nancy Grace thing.  What Nancy Grace thing?  That's a good one.  A nice mashup on YouTube.  Oh, good.  Which is making the rounds.  Pretty funny.  She talks about weed.  And then Madonna.  Madonna got herself in trouble as well. 
[01:53:00]  Every day, someone's getting in trouble for something.  And they're always saying they're sorry.  Oh, that's what you got to do.  Why the doodle?  But you don't, though.  Phil Robertson didn't.  I mean, he said he was sorry and offended people, but he's stuck by what he said.  Sure.  One of the rare occasions that he didn't say sorry.  Yeah.  And then what?  Then you say sorry and everything's okay again.  Like, how fucking sensitive is everybody?  It's insincere.  Ridiculous.  Well, take a look at these choppers. 
[01:53:30]  It's the last you're going to see them.  Oh, shit.  The falsies.  They're not falsies.  They're veneers.  So tomorrow you'll have much whiter teeth?  The temporaries.  Now, I...  Why can't the temporaries just be the teeth?  Well, because they're artistically made.  I know, but why?  I think that's a whole scam.  No, it takes a long time to make them.  I think it's a scam.  They can't make them on site.  So why do you need temporaries? 
[01:54:00]  Because...  You've got your teeth.  I think it's a scam to get a second fucking bill from you.  No, here's what they got to do.  All right.  They take an impression of my teeth the way they are right now.  Got it.  Then they got to file down some stuff.  Got it.  And then they take another impression, because that's what the new teeth are going to adhere  to.  Right.  So they...  Can I ask you a question?  Are the backs of your teeth any different?  Because your tongue is always pressing against the back, making the N sound?  Yeah, the worn...  It's worn away.  It's so worn from the N word.  Use of the N word. 
[01:54:30]  Back of your teeth, you can see out from them.  Holy shit.  It's got bay windows now.  This is funny.  See, so then they have to send all those impressions and everything to the place that  actually makes the laminate.  So?  And that takes a while.  So why do you need fake ones then?  Because you don't want to walk around with filed teeth.  Oh, they got a file.  Yeah, they got like...  What are they going...  Are your fake teeth on now?  No, I go today.  Today's the big day. 
[01:55:00]  I hope there's a power outage because of the snow and your shithead has fucking filed  sharp little teeth.  I have to walk around and have filed teeth.  Oh, that sucks.  So tomorrow starts the...  Tomorrow I will come in and have temporary front teeth.  How looking forward to this are you?  I can't wait.  I'm not going to sleep tonight.  I know.  I'll be here at 4 o'clock.  I'm just all nervous.  Just watching the clock.  I'm all nervous.  I went to another dentist yesterday. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah?  The hummus tooth.  The great hummus disaster.  The great hummus disaster.  So now I'm on to an oral surgeon where they do that x-ray.  Oh, the one that spins around your head?  I've never had the spinny x-ray for teeth.  They get like the entire...  It's like almost a 3D image.  Well, I was eating hummus.  I got to run through it again.  I broke down...  A big piece of my tooth just falls out.  That hummus is tough.  Sure.  So then I go...  I get a crown.  And then I got some significant pain after the crown. 
[01:56:00]  So my dentist, you know, he figured out how to get another bill in him.  Because he probably knew at the time that I needed a root canal.  But he went crown because he doesn't do the root canals.  So he gets his money.  Right.  So then I go back.  And I like this guy too.  And I go, hey man, the tooth with the crown, it hurts.  He goes, well, you got to get a root canal.  I'm like, well, thanks.  Because I don't have dental.  We don't have dental.  No.  No one has dental, really.  Hey, pay for all this.  So then I go to the root canal guy.  Oh, he says it's a perfect root canal.  Still fucking hurts.  Go back to the dentist. 
[01:56:30]  He goes, well, maybe we got to grind down the teeth because maybe the bite's not right.  Okay, let's do that.  He does that.  That still hurts.  Well, you better go back to the root canal guy.  Go back to the root canal guy.  The fuck are you going to?  He goes, you know what?  I'm going to file down the tooth a little bit more.  That should give you some relief.  Files it down.  A little relief.  Still hurts.  Bite down on the blue paper and go...  Grr, grr, grr, grr, grr.  So then the root canal guy is like, I don't know.  I'm at a loss.  Let's move you on to the oral surgeon guy.  It might be a fracture or something.  Or he might have to go in and cut the root from the fucking base. 
[01:57:00]  Or we do a reverse cavity fill, it's called, where they actually go...  Oh, go in from the top?  And fill it in that way.  Fuck that.  So I go to this guy yesterday, I go in this office, and one of my pet peeves in life that  drives me fucking insane...  Did you see how I just sat up to tell you this?  Yeah.  When you go into a new doctor's office, and they go, can you fill this out?  And it's form after form after form. 
[01:57:30]  Same shit you filled out at the last doctor.  It drives me absolutely nuts, and I can't control myself.  This one actually asked for my nickname.  What?  I'm like, why do you need my nickname?  Oof.  And it was like...  Exactly.  And they said that you're not allowed to write that on the floor.  And it was...  The detail they wanted.  My schooling.  My boss.  That's crazy.  Do you know the address of this place?  I don't.  So now I have to Google up the address. 
[01:58:00]  Do you know the business phone number?  No, I don't know that either.  And it just went on and on and on, and I'm sitting there just heating up.  I'm like, I'd rather fucking not do this.  You know what?  I went to a dentist recently and made the appointment.  They email a confirmation and all the shit.  All the forms?  So I sat at home.  You sit at home just filling that on your computer.  Beautiful.  You email it back to them, and then when you go in, you have nothing to fill out.  Right.  It's like all fucking done already.  And even just looking at your insurance card, what number is the group number? 
[01:58:30]  Or which one is the member ID?  I know.  It drives me insane.  Do you get confused about what's the group number and what's the member?  Because it's a different terminology they use on your card and on the fucking form.  Dude, and I start filling in so hard that the pen goes through the paper.  That's how frustrated I go nuts over this shit.  You know, I keep a photo of cards in a special little folder on my phone.  So you don't have to go through your wallet and try to find anything.  That's smart.  So you got like, I got credit, because obviously your phone, it gets lost. 
[01:59:00]  It's got the password.  No one really breaks into your fucking phone.  You could disable it.  You could wipe it out from your computer.  So I'm not afraid someone's going to get it and get all the information.  But between pictures, contacts, and everything else on there, you know, there's sensitive shit anyway.  And we talked about it.  If someone comes up with the app where you have all your fucking info, but then the doctor's offices, they got to be in on it.  And where you go, oh, you want my info?  Boom.  Here you go.  Zit.  And then what happens?  It pops into their computer.  And if they have other things they need, then a sheet spits out. 
[01:59:30]  We only need these four questions, sir.  That's it.  That's all you're down to.  How great would that be?  It should be that.  So I was there for war.  It took me at least a half hour to fill out the forms.  Yeah.  Then I went and got the x-ray.  A guy goes, you're good.  I'm like, what do you mean I'm good?  What do you mean good?  It hurts.  He goes, it looks great.  Then he goes, it's a great root canal.  There's no infection.  He goes, I'm at a loss here.  I'm like, what are you fucking calling me a liar?  Oh, shit. 
[02:00:00]  I actually said that.  Oh, shit.  He goes, you probably have a micro fracture.  And eventually we'll have to pull the tooth.  But I don't want to do that now because I don't see anything really wrong here.  Goes with a micropenis.  And a microphone.  So what happened then?  I just got a fucking deal.  It's not pain.  It's just I notice the tooth every fucking day.  Yeah, yeah.  But anyway.  And then they go, that's 350 bucks.  Sure.  I don't care how much fucking money you make. 
[02:00:30]  $350, really?  The guy saw me for 10 seconds and an x-ray.  I'm 20 grand deep in the past six months in dental work.  20 grand deep.  But they did everything like pulling out all the old silver fillings and putting in the  white fillings so you don't see it.  But that's worth it.  It's that.  Yeah.  And replacing caps and bridges.  One of the first things I did when I finally got money was get rid of all that fucking silver  in my mouth, man.  I haven't done that.  I don't have a few caps. 
[02:01:00]  It's the best.  Is it bad for you to have it in your mouth or no?  Well, they say it's not good, but.  I think it's over time, too.  Your teeth are more apt to crack from it because it's put in there under like crazy pressure.  That shit.  And your teeth are more apt to crack if you have that.  Just cosmetically.  Yeah, cosmetically it's better.  Over my mouth, it's all pretty much white.  And I love the fact that I could eat fucking hot stuff, drink cold stuff, and nothing.  It's fucking great.  And that was a problem over it.  Really?  Yeah, that was getting like sensitive teeth. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You just weren't going to the dentist.  No, I wasn't.  It wasn't rotting or anything, but it was just, you know, not taking care of the fucking  fillings that were there.  Guess who?  Did I tell you when I went for a clean?  I go for cleaning every six months, whatever, and whitening, because of the coffee.  And the nurse told me I had really good gums, and I've heard that before.  Yes.  And I loved my compliments so much, I was like, what did you say?  Because I wanted to hear it again.  But she didn't repeat it. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, no.  No, even the Jamaican nurse knew I was a needy fucking cunt.  What was that?  She just ignored me.  What was that?  Kept scooping under them.  Good.  But filling out those forms.  It is annoying, and there should be a better way.  I mean, like we say, in this day and age, like you said, an app.  Well, something they can scan.  Someone's saying they do have an app, but I haven't come across it yet.  Me either.  In my travels.  This guy has the...  With that fucking clipboard they give you.  Ready for this?  Because they really did ask for my nickname, which I didn't fucking give. 
[02:02:30]  This guy has the answer to that.  Tim in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, Tim, what's up?  Tim.  Jersey.  Jesus Christ.  Jersey.  Tim.  Jersey.  Dental rep.  Anyway, dental reps want your nickname.  And that way, they can call to collect on your bill pretending to be someone you know.  Seriously?  You think that's why they're asking for the nickname?  Yeah.  It's like, hey, is Opie there?  Right.  And then someone will be like, oh. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, of course.  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, sure.  Well, wait one moment.  Yeah, I'm Opie.  I know.  You could still just hang up on him.  Someone call me up and goes, hey, is Horsecock there?  I would know.  I didn't know.  Right down.  Horsecock.  Did you see Nicolini the other day?  It looks like she's fucking being held hostage.  On what?  Who's, what's, what's going on?  What happened?  Who's this?  Who's this?  It's Tim.  What?  $10.  Did you see Nicolini, your ex, on TV? 
[02:03:30]  It looks like she come up for a bad night of 2-2 with some big black eagles.  What are you talking about, sir?  Are you the dental guy?  It says dental ref wants your nickname so they can call.  No, I was calling because I was telling Opie that they ask for your nickname so they can  call and make believe they're your fucking buddy because you don't pay your bill and then  get you on the fucking phone.  That's what they do.  Okay.  Hey, Johnny.  Yeah, pay your fucking bill. 
[02:04:00]  That's what they do.  All right.  Good.  Thank you.  And Jill Nicolini doesn't look that great these days.  Isn't that what he was saying?  I haven't seen her look bad.  I haven't seen her.  I haven't seen her in a while.  I saw her on Fox, on Fox News.  Yeah, she looked like a deer in the headlights, man, the other morning.  She looked like she just got gangbanged and she did like, you know.  Jill Nicolini is a nice lady.  Yeah, how do you know what someone will say after they get gangbanged?  What's that mean?  You look in your mirror.  Yeah, exactly.  So. 
[02:04:30]  It could be.  She's very nice.  It could be a little more, a little nicer.  Sir, sir.  Well, she's sweet.  It didn't work out with Ann, but they don't have issues.  She was extremely nice to Anthony and everyone else around here.  Exactly.  No, she's a sweet girl.  But I mean, the other morning, man, she looks horrible, like somebody was holding a gun to her head or something.  All right.  So she's been gangbanged by Negroes and had a gun to her head.  Can't you just say the girl looked tired?  Yeah.  Sometimes people just look tired.  I don't know about it.  Jesus.  I didn't want to be late.  I remember a few good nights out where I'd watch her the next morning.  And you knew. 
[02:05:00]  And I knew.  I'd be like, oh, I don't even know how she's fucking up doing that.  Oh, my God.  We used to lag down in a few bottles of wine.  And then she'd be able to go on TV that early.  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah, that would be fucking amazing.  When she popped you for that laundry bell, and I was like, what the fuck?  And then I realized I see her every morning.  I've never seen the same fucking outfit twice.  So it all makes sense.  Yeah, a good closet full of clothes.  Looks like someone likes Julie Green.  I know, right?  You're a fucking stalker, dude.  Keeping tabs on her.  Jesus H. Christ. 
[02:05:30]  So?  No, it's just, you know.  Whatevs.  No, she's talking about it.  Fuck yeah.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  And Melanie in Philly wants on with Tim in Jersey.  Melanie.  What's up, Mellie?  Hey, guys.  Love your show.  Philly girls don't play.  This would be ugly.  Go ahead, Melanie.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Honestly, if the guy is a douchebag and doesn't pay his bill, that's awesome.  The reason they ask you that is because if you have, like, 16 consonants in your name  and you go by Joe, that's why they do that.  We do it at our job, too. 
[02:06:00]  If your name is, like, Roch Kalamala.  She's an escort.  People can't announce it.  But it's Greg.  Yeah.  It's Greg.  Yeah.  My name's pretty easy.  I guess they ask everybody, though.  It would be a little odd.  Like, hey, what's your nickname so we can just say it here?  Right.  Yes.  I'm a good name to Chad or whatever the fuck his name is.  But, yeah, you're right.  Greg, I mean, what kind of nickname could you possibly ask?  How about Double G?  Because he has two G's in his name.  Thank you.  I like being called Double G.  G-R-E-G-G.  Officially, it is three G's.  What's up, Triple G?  Triple G.  Or White Shadow, because he was the white blonde guy on the basketball team. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, Ken Howard.  They call him Ken Howard.  And he calls me Salami, and we do White Howard references.  There is another reason why.  Because some old schools, if your name is, like, Frank Joseph, you go by Joseph instead of Frank,  even though that's your God.  It's just some dumb familiarity.  Yeah.  Hey, Skip.  Right, right.  Hey.  All right, guys.  You're flossing.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, Melanie.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tim.  I had a thing when I was growing up.  I would tell people I was Greg with two G's. 
[02:07:00]  I would go, Greg, Double G's, like Greg Allman.  I'd be so happy that my name was spelled differently.  And the only other person that I ever saw with the name spelled G-R-E-G-G was Greg Allman.  So I was very, very, I couldn't wait to tell people.  Two G's, like Genghis Khan.  Double G, like Greg Allman, I would say.  Oh, no.  Like Greg Allman.  Oh, man.  Yuck.  Oh, wow. 
[02:07:30]  Because I hated the name Gregory, which I'm not.  No.  Double G.  I never knew Greg Allman spelled his name that way.  Oh, I knew because that's how I spelled mine.  Double G's.  Kenny had to send me a text saying it's snowing.  I got that, too.  You got that one?  He showed a picture of his heart on, too.  It started snowing.  So what, we should go home?  No.  I guess we got to go home because the snow started.  Big snowstorm.  We want to keep everyone safe today.  You live 10 minutes away.  Big snowstorm.  Well, I'm worried about everyone else that live outside the city.  What's the latest? 
[02:08:00]  11.59.  Let's say hi to Brother Joe.  Brother Joe.  What's Joe doing?  What's up, fellas?  Hi, Joe.  Yeah, there's an app called Lemon Wallet.  Lemon Party?  Lemon Wallet.  Which of old people love.  That's what it's called.  It holds every card you have, including, like, your NRA card and your license and all the  information.  Oh, yeah?  Because I just take a picture of it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  And it locks.  And it locks, like, you know, within the app.  Lemon Wallet.  The other thing is, this is an informative call.  Aetna Dental Access for anybody who can't afford, you know, dental bills.  It's not me.  Well, I know it's not you, but I'm talking for the average man.  We have, um, it's, I have it.  It's like a hundred bucks a year and it saves you thousands on root canal and all kinds of  shit.  My teeth are completely done.  I've never heard of, uh, what, do you need to make a certain amount or not over? 
[02:09:00]  Nope.  You go online, you pay a hundred bucks for the year, and it cuts your dental bills by  thousands.  What?  I never heard of that.  Wow.  It's called, it's called Aetna Dental Access.  They owe me a couple of years of membership now for plugging them.  What's up?  I'm going to fucking sign up for it because I know, I have a feeling I'm going to be going  down the old root canal.  It's awesome.  Like I said, I went 20 grand deep, 20 grand already, and the most expensive part now is  what is coming up, the stupid laminates.  Last time I went, last time I went for root canal, which was only a couple of months ago, 
[02:09:30]  I went in, they charged me, it was like 1800 bucks.  I ended up, uh, giving them the card.  They did not apply the card.  When I got home, like 1800 was a lot more than the last one I got.  They knocked, when I told them, you know, that, that I gave them the card and they didn't,  they realized they didn't apply it.  They knocked 600 bucks off of it.  Jeez.  So it was 1200 rather than 18.  And that was, uh,  Is that what a root canal goes for these days?  What?  1800 bucks?  Oh yeah, it was, that's about what I paid.  Yup.  Is that for everything?  The crown on top and everything? 
[02:10:00]  No.  No, no, no, no.  Then you're going to go back to your regular dentist.  Well, in my case, uh, the root canal had to go through the crown that he already did.  Oh, they've had to destroy the crown.  So I had to pay for the crown.  Then I had to pay for the root canal.  Then I had to go back to the dentist for him to fix the, the, the root canal holes.  Wow.  Because they put some temporary shit in there until you go back to your dentist.  How, why can't they do that part?  They're all specialists.  They all figured out how to be specialists and pass the money around.  I still go to Zeman in, uh, in, uh, Zeman, you know, for the, well, you know, for the  work, for the, um, for the post and crown and all that. 
[02:10:30]  But, um, what's the oral surgeon?  The guy that was on Letterman.  He was dentistry.  He's in Huntington.  I hope you should know him.  Oh, I remember.  Yeah.  Letterman did like, uh, Letterman.  That's the guy that I go to.  Oh, okay.  Why, why would I know this guy?  He did a bit.  On Letterman, he did a bit.  Oh, yeah, he was a pretty popular guy.  Uh, Richard, I can't remember his last name.  Anyway, he was like painless dentistry.  And, uh, yeah, he did it.  He did a root canal.  Why aren't they all painless dentistry?  That is some people.  Who's pro pain? 
[02:11:00]  Do you know how they make it painless?  Let me tell you.  First, at first, they give you shots all around it and on the hell out of you.  But when they start drilling into like a bad tooth and you go, ah, he puts the needle right  in the nerve.  It was like a, it's not that he pioneered.  It was like a technique that this guy pioneered.  It's not painless because they got to fucking stick that needle in there in the first place.  And it hurts for a, for a millisecond.  Yeah.  But it hurts like no one's business.  Blinding pain for like a millisecond.  Painless.  Yeah, but then you're good.  But here's the problem with dentists in general. 
[02:11:30]  They don't have patience to wait for the Novocaine.  So they give you that shot.  You feeling numb?  They give you that shot.  They go and do paperwork for two minutes.  And then they can't wait any long.  So they're like, ah, that's good enough.  And they start.  It's like, ow.  Because all of us feel the Novocaine after we leave the dentist.  Because that's when everything is ridiculously numb, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  But they start their shit when you're still just numbing up everything.  Yeah.  Because they literally, that's what they should do as soon as you get in the office is pop 
[02:12:00]  you with that fucking Novocaine.  Yeah.  Right away.  They'll tell you not to eat for an hour or two because you'll be ingesting your tongue.  You'll chew your tongue up.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I guess we got poker Friday?  Saturday.  Ah, it's Saturday.  Okay.  Joe, why are you now telling Anthony about the Zetna?  After he's 20 grand in the hole.  I bet they wouldn't have paid for a lot of the cosmetic stuff that I'm having done.  I have to sit in there and watch him play in blackjack. 
[02:12:30]  I figure he doesn't need to play with you.  You're like, ah, snowman.  Pointy card.  Pointy card.  Pointy card.  Snowman.  What do the Germans say?  Nine, nine, nine.  Oh, my God.  I'm just yelling that.  Jesus.  All right.  That was fun.  We got to do that again.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  All right.  I'll talk to you soon, guys.  Later, man.  We got one more.  Josh in Boston wants to tell you about what's going to happen.  Oh, I bet he's joshing.  Because tomorrow you're going to have grinded down teeth and fake veneers.  Uh-huh. 
[02:13:00]  What are they?  No, I didn't want to tell them what happened.  I just wanted to say good morning, men.  Hi, Sam.  Oh.  Also, no, the people who would have nicknamed people are full of shit.  The only reason they want your nickname is so if there's more than one person with your  first name, they can call you by your nickname because it's illegal to say your last name because  it's a HIPAA violation.  Well, it depends on your weight.  I love how we're getting an answer to the nickname question.  Three different answers, by the way.  And he's been helping me out. 
[02:13:30]  Denny's been awesome with me.  He's been helping me out in my DJ business.  I appreciate it.  Oh, good.  Good for you, buddy.  Thank you.  All right.  You know what?  That guy, that position switched.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's something that happens on the show.  That switched.  The guy that I wanted on line one is long gone, and then I get that guy.  That guy.  I would have never taken your call.  No offense.  Yeah, I hear you.  But the guy before him on the same line wanted to say that you're going to sound like shit  with the temporaries.  And there's another guy that would have said that, and then someone would have called and  said, that guy's full of shit because I heard from my wonderful dentist that it'll be fine. 
[02:14:00]  Okay.  It will be totally fine.  They're not going to fuck with anything.  The backs of the teeth.  So it's not going to be like this.  Fucking chippus.  There's nothing wrong with sounding like that, man.  You just sound like you're busy.  That'll be great.  It totally destroys my fucking radio career because I end up not being able to speak properly.  Oh, I love that. 
[02:14:30]  You're biting the tip of your dumb tongue off.  It's not affecting other guys.  Dumb tongue.  And it's not affecting other guys that came before us.  Exactly.  Howard and Imus are both sounding a little funny.  Oh, speaking of Melissa Harris Perry, did you see the Marines thing yet?  The Marines thing.  I'm calling it the Marines thing because I don't want to give it away.  Give it away.  Give it away.  Give it away now. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, you got it right there.  All right.  Just play that.  This is our pal from MSNBC that has a...  Is this the blubbering woman?  Yeah, the...  Newsbusters.  Watch what she does now.  Well, if there is anything that is quintessentially American, it is our military.  And their goal can be seen in their very mottos.  The Army's this will defend or Semper Fi, always faithful for the Marines.  Semper Fi.  Semper Fi.  She said Semper Fi. 
[02:15:30]  No one has ever said Semper Fi.  No, unless they were like, how much does Semper cost?  She said Semper Fi.  Can you go back?  That's how she says it.  If it doesn't cost anything, Semper Fi.  See, it's free, but she can't talk right.  I know, but it's not with the R's.  No, it's not.  I sure went off half cocked there.  You sure did.  That was a real bim. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, she stinks, doesn't she?  Semper Fi.  Semper Fi.  Listen to the first part, because there's a big...  Is there?  She comes in on a...  Because, well...  If there is anything that is quintessentially American, it is our military, and their goal  can be seen in their very mottos.  The Army's this will defend or Semper Fi, always faithful for the Marines.  Semper Fi.  Fucking...  If you're in a broadcast and you lisp, you should fucking have your teeth fucking removed 
[02:16:30]  and put back in farther in front.  It's astounding.  There's a lot of them in broadcasting.  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw was one.  You know, one of the Bush broads is on GMA, or was it GMA?  What fucking show was I watching?  Today's show, maybe?  Yeah.  She does some pieces for the Today Show.  And she speaks horribly, too.  Does she?  She's talking to this thing, Jenna.  Something like this?  She's like this.  Can you find her? 
[02:17:00]  I think it's Jenna.  Semper Fi.  Jenna Bush has a thing going on, too, man.  See if you can hear it.  Kathy Lee is out today, out west, but guess who's here?  Jenna Bush Hager was nice enough to step in.  You know what my favorite part is?  We're sitting here before the show.  She's fucking pretty, eh?  No, she's not.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  She's pretty?  And what does it say?  I think she's not bad.  My mother, who's watching, who's watching, hi, mom, wrote me, of course, I have to put 
[02:17:30]  in the password, wrote me this.  What does it say?  Just breathe.  Take deep breaths and go into zen mode like Dad did before the debate.  Go back.  She has an underbite.  I'm going to do a yoga breath.  She's got a little underbite thing going on there.  Zen mode like Dad did before the debate.  Zen mode like...  She said, take deep breaths.  And buzzed.  And what does it say?  Well, my mother, who's watching, yes, watching, hi, mom, wrote me, of course, I have to put  in the password, wrote me this.  What does it say?  Just breathe.  Take deep breaths and go into zen mode like Dad did before the debate. 
[02:18:00]  Debates.  So, all right, mom, for you, I'm going to do a yoga breath.  No, man.  Isn't that fucked up?  I got a little trouble there.  What's that?  What's that?  She might just be nervous.  No, man.  Does she talk like that?  All the time.  She's kind of cute, though.  I think she's, uh...  Was she the partying one?  I'm not sure.  Is she the one that used to party?  Remember when the Jenna, the Bush girls were always in fucking...  And some shit.  In Dutch.  Underage drinking and shit.  Yeah, it was great.  She's not bad looking. 
[02:18:30]  No, not at all.  She's all right.  You know.  I think it's just all right.  I think she's rather lovely.  I think her sister is better looking.  She reminds me too much of her dad in the mouth, which, you know, kind of kills it,  but...  Yeah.  You can definitely tell that she's George Bush's daughter.  Last night, I just had the fucking urge out of nowhere to watch the Miss Teen Delaware  fucking porno movie again.  Porno clip.  Remember when she was fucking getting fucked from behind and then come on her face?  I was looking at Twitter and she was tweeting something about how, you know, the highest mountains 
[02:19:00]  are no obstacle for her.  And I'm like, ah, you know, let me watch her fuck.  Speaking of big mountains, I'll have to put my dick between them and come right in the valley.  She's always got these fucking tweets that are all very spiritual and uplifting.  And it inspired me to watch her getting fucked from behind by a moose cocked.  There you go.  Yeah.  Pretty good stuff.  Why don't we do the Richard Sherman thing? 
[02:19:30]  So he ended up apologizing.  Completely ridiculous.  I hate sportsmanship, that fake sportsmanship.  Fake stuff, yeah.  After a big fucking game, they all feel like they've got to, like, you know, compliment the  other team and this and that.  And this Richard Sherman has a real thing going on with Crabtree.  And, you know, Sherman makes an amazing play.  And it puts the Seahawks, look, it's everywhere.  It puts the Seahawks in the fucking Super Bowl.  And just a mere minute later, Aaron Andrews is talking to the guy. 
[02:20:00]  You've got to be feeling like, yeah!  He's out of his fucking mind.  He made the play that gets his team in the Super Bowl.  They're at home in Seattle, which is a crazy fucking atmosphere to be dealing with.  Wait, where was the pass, too?  Was it an end zone pass?  Fuck yeah.  Did you see this?  No.  He made an amazing play.  He tipped it up and then...  Oh, right there.  Here it is. 
[02:20:30]  He marched all the way down the field.  There's only 30 seconds left in the game.  Oh, man.  Wow, yeah.  That is pretty important.  That was it.  That was it.  Big one.  This puts him in the Super Bowl.  The hands of Richard Sherman.  Wow.  And then he, you know, he gives Crabtree the business because they just have problems.  And he tried to shake his hand and say, good game.  Did he?  Yes.  He ran over to him. 
[02:21:00]  He hit on the ass.  No, but he was being a dick about it.  Yeah, he was being a dick.  He was being a complete dick about it.  But then Crabtree shoved him in the face.  Yeah, yeah.  Crabtree's like, get your shit away from me.  Fuck you.  Oh, Miss Crabtree.  They don't like each other.  No.  Then he did the choking sign.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He didn't mean the handshake.  No one likes that.  No.  That choke thing.  He didn't mean that at all.  Let's see.  How close is this pass to being caught?  I mean, I don't think it was...  Oh, boy.  Was that a catchable pass?  Wow.  That was a catchable pass.  You really think?  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  It was right there.  I mean, it was an amazing defensive play.  Dude.  Oh, he's right up there.  All right.  You're right.  He's right up there.  Wow.  That's fucking a catchable pass.  That's how the game ended.  It was a great fucking game, man.  I was all in watching that one.  Dude, that was right to it.  And then Crabtree, because now Sherman's talking shit, so Crabtree fucking pushes him with his  left hand.  Of course.  You're not going to the Super Bowl now because of that.  And you did it against a guy that you don't like.  So it was a perfect, perfect fucking storm.  So Aaron Andrews gets to talk to Sherman right after the game. 
[02:22:00]  I mean, you know, most of us have heard the rant by now.  I have not heard it.  Well, let's just play it.  Richard, let me ask you the final play.  Take me through it.  Well, I'm the best corner of the game.  When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're going to get.  Don't you ever talk about me.  Who was talking about you?  Crabtree, don't you open your mouth about the best.  Or I'm going to shut it for you real quick.  L-O-B.  All right.  Before.  And Joe, back over to you. 
[02:22:30]  Why did they bail out of that, these fucking assholes?  No, I think he laughed.  No, no, no.  He laughed.  He made his point.  He was like, I ain't dealing with your dumb questions.  I'm out of here.  That's the rant?  That's the problem?  Bow your heads!  Yeah, I guess.  What was the one?  Travis, who made...  Of course that's the one.  Who made that point?  I'm saying, yeah, I guess, meaning that it shouldn't have been a problem.  Who made that brilliant point?  Oh, someone on Huffington Post. 
[02:23:00]  What a great...  Because, again, we're such a bully-obsessed, just country of sissies.  Right.  Someone on Huffington Post said, how would this generation handle Muhammad Ali?  Right.  Yeah.  Who did nothing but talk shit.  Right.  Yeah.  And that's sometimes okay to do in sports.  And I love...  Isaac Saul.  Isaac Saul.  Okay.  I love that shit.  Even if it was against my team, I still would fucking support that.  That is real...  That's real emotions coming out after a huge fucking game. 
[02:23:30]  I like...  Here's where I like sportsmanship.  After two guys fight in a ring, there's a weird thing there, like, when they actually  both had this weird bond, like, when two fighters hug at the end, it's like they've  just fucking slugged it out.  No one in that arena knows what they just did but those two.  There's a weird bond they seem to kind of share.  Right.  But here's the problem.  Most people hated it, right, Travis?  Twitter exploded.  Yeah.  There was a lot of racist stuff on Twitter.  Right.  People couldn't handle it.  People couldn't handle that Richard Sherman was having a fucking real moment after an amazing 
[02:24:00]  play.  That's great.  He didn't like Crabtree.  Crabtree doesn't like him.  Right.  Fuck him.  And then, of course, you know, you fast forward a couple days and you got Richard Sherman apologizing,  which is just like, you know, he doesn't mean any of that.  He doesn't want to have to apologize.  It should have been able to just sit there.  Why did he apologize, Travis?  I think his coach talked to him.  Well, it did take away a little bit from the win because that clip went viral. 
[02:24:30]  But still, I don't even believe that part of the story.  I don't think it takes away from the game at all because we all saw the game.  It was an amazing fucking game.  And that played a great end.  Now everybody's talking about, you know, him instead of that.  But that's the weakness in the press.  That has nothing to do with him.  Like, that's the fact that the press is weak and thinks that that's more interesting.  And the public obviously thinks that's more interesting.  So why is that a problem?  Yeah.  It's not like he said something outrageous.  He doesn't like Crabtree.  Crabtree doesn't like him.  They asked him a question.  I almost understand the apology just because he's trying to squash it so now they can focus on the Super Bowl. 
[02:25:00]  But they're still going to ask him about this.  It's going to still be a big fucking thing.  Oh, yeah.  When it's media week, that's all they're going to talk about.  Let's say hi to Mo in Brooklyn.  Mo.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Why I ought to.  All right.  On that play, it was a good play.  It wasn't a great play.  It's not like he ripped the ball out of Crabtree's hand.  It was a little bit underthrown.  He didn't make the interception. 
[02:25:30]  He made the deflection.  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  A couple things.  I agree with you.  I thought the ball was a little underthrown, but it was absolutely catchable.  And Richard Sherman looked like he was a bit out of position, and that's why he made an amazing play.  He was able to fucking still tip that ball.  Right.  And I think what happened in the interview.  You just sound jealous, Mo.  Nah.  Listen, I think what happened in that interview was when he started talking about LLB, which is their nickname, right?  I don't think network knew what LLB is, so they cut it away thinking it was some gang. 
[02:26:00]  Must be some gang thing.  We better cut out immediately.  No, I think the whole thing there was Richard Sherman was done and moved on.  I don't think it was a cutout at all.  What's he, a tank or something?  Hey, listen.  Last Monday, when you guys farted in, I listened to last week's show.  You guys were doing the whole thing on reality TV.  Yes.  Did you ever notice that they're looking for Bigfoot, the most elusive creature on Earth?  And they walk into the fucking woods and start screaming and yelling with Dwight Cruz and banging on trees. 
[02:26:30]  And they think this character that's been hiding forever is going to come out then?  That's good.  Kind of like it.  You're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  And the other thing is, if you watch the whole gamut of reality shows, you know, you've got the Kardashians and you've got the fucking shots from Persia and all these fuckers with all the money,  and then you see the people that live in the woods off-grid that have nothing, they're the happiest fucking people on TV.  So I don't think all the Gucci and designer shit means anything.  It's just kind of farting. 
[02:27:00]  All the people that have are miserable, have not the fucking happy with no water electricity shit in the woods.  Great show, guys.  Enjoy you every morning, man.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Mo.  Thank you.  Josh in Seattle, congratulations to your Seahawks, by the way.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Who are picking to win the Super Bowl.  Have they ever won?  No, we've only been once.  You guys were in it in 2005, I think.  Yeah.  No, 2006 or so.  2006, okay. 
[02:27:30]  2005, whatever.  I hate that.  It's like, is it the season or the date that the Super Bowl was played?  I guess it would be in the 2006.  Yeah, all right.  Go ahead, Josh.  Either way, no.  So after his little fun explosion on the field, which we all enjoy here in Seattle,  he sat in a post-game press conference and he kept repeating very, literally,  he was a very mediocre receiver and kept repeating it with a huge smile on his face.  And it was the funniest thing ever. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, that's great.  I love all of them.  I love all that stuff.  I love it.  Yeah.  A little smack.  Out here, the rivalry between the two are so intense that on my way to work to Seattle  every day, there's this big billboard, video billboard, and San Francisco's been buying  it for like the last two months, talking shit about Seattle every day.  Something about, like this morning I drove through and it said, had a picture of Richard  Sherman and said, no class.  Oh, God.  With class.  Enough of people with class.  Class. 
[02:28:30]  They don't like each other.  The players don't like each other.  Well, the two teams don't like each other.  This rivalry, I didn't realize how deep it was.  You guys put together each other's team trying to figure out how to beat the other team.  Oh, yeah.  We steal players from all the time.  They focus on each other more than the rest of the league.  Because we're the best this year together in the NFC.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd say.  That was a well-deserved game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially if the guys don't like each other.  I have no problem with what he said. 
[02:29:00]  And the guy he tried, the guy just mushed his face after.  They have a whole issue between them.  What are you supposed to do?  What, they're going to fake it?  Apparently, they've got a, on, and they had Crabtree and Sherman Mike during that game  and on NFL Network on Wednesday, they're going to play some of the clips of Ben Hawkins.  Oh, that's got to be great.  So, where does the problem, where does it come from with these two?  Yeah.  I think it's just cornerbacks and wide receivers in general.  And I think they were in college together and just kind of started during that time. 
[02:29:30]  I mean, you're competing with each other the whole time.  So, it goes way back.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Josh.  Hey, thanks, guys.  He doesn't know.  Hey, thanks, guys.  He doesn't know.  He has no idea.  He has no idea.  He's up there just rooting for the Seahawks.  Right.  He has no idea.  Thank you, Travis.  We got the...  Oh, what is this?  His resignation.  Oh, Travis is handing out some papers.  Apparently, his resignation.  Yeah, I got to go.  Let's say hi to Kyle in Alabama. 
[02:30:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, real quick.  The reason Sherman and Crabtree don't like each other stems from a charity game they had earlier in the season  where Sherman was trying to shake Crabtree's hand and talk to him, and he sloughed him off and walked away.  Oh.  A charity game.  What's that?  They do little charity events that players do.  The NFL Players Association do those charity events at the beginning of the season.  Oh, you said a charity event.  I thought you said charity game.  I'd never heard of them, actually.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, charity event.  Okay.  Yeah, and that's where it came from. 
[02:30:30]  He went up to shake his hand and talk to him and stuff, and Crabtree blew him off.  Right.  He vowed.  He said, now there's an article earlier.  He vowed to make him pay for that or embarrass him a bunch of people.  So then it becomes a perfect ending to that game.  Just amazing.  Right.  That's where a lot of that stemmed from.  But I would want to see if y'all seen that.  They made like a WWE.  It's like an F parody video of the Richard Sherman interview with like Mean Gene Uncle.  Yeah.  I saw it.  You want to play it? 
[02:31:00]  It works as an audio bit.  Yeah.  Thanks, Kyle.  Hey, and Jimmy, I'm coming Thursday to see you.  Thanks, Kyle.  See you in Atlanta, buddy.  I'll be at the punchline.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Jesus.  Thank you, Kyle.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to be in Atlanta this weekend.  Wednesday, Friday, Saturday.  Very nice.  Shows are sold out already.  Very cool.  Check local listings, which means nothing.  This is what he was referring to.  Oh, yeah.  The greatest intercontinental champion of all time.  Well, I'm the best corner of the game.  When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're going to get. 
[02:31:30]  Don't you ever talk about me.  Did I ask a question, Macho Man?  Don't you open your mouth about the best.  I'm sorry about that.  L-O-B.  They faked that.  Ah, yes, Chip.  That got put in after.  Yeah, yeah, they did, Chip.  Somebody did that.  It's okay, though.  Don't be mad.  Bunch of bull turkey.  Bull sugar.  Bull sugar.  Bark Had.  Bark Had. 
[02:32:00]  Bark Had.  Bark Had.  Ad By will be in studio next.  Bark Had.  I think it's Ad By.  Yeah, I think so.  Bark Had.  Semper Fee.  Ad By.  From the Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  The guy from the Boat Movie will be in next.  So, and we'll do more rants from famous people after the interview and the Nancy Grace thing  and the Madonna thing.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  The opening of the show is back on SiriusXX. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  Mentality Mag on the Twitter says that Fox definitely pulled out of the interview.  I didn't know that.  It seemed a little abrupt.  It seemed like he did, because Aaron Andrews goes, oh, okay. 
[02:33:00]  Because I thought she was ready to ask him another question and he was gone.  Mm.  All right.  And there's some interesting info on Richard Sherman.  Are we, we got the boat guy yet?  No, he's coming in a second.  The boat guy.  Are they getting him?  Yeah, I think he's just finishing up somewhere.  He's coming back.  Oh, okay.  No, I'm wondering if I have time.  So, I'm learning about this Richard Sherman.  He has a hell of a story.  A great story.  He's 25 years old.  He's from Compton. 
[02:33:30]  Compton, the CPT.  Graduated from one of the worst school districts in the United States.  Yeah.  One that boasts a high school graduation rate of 57%.  In a country where 68% of all federal and state inmates are lacking a high school diploma.  Straight out of Compton.  You could say Sherman avoided a horrifying fate.  But to say he got lucky or escaped would be full hearty.  He didn't just graduate either.  He finished with a 4.2 GPA, second in his class, and went on to Stanford University.  One of the most prestigious places to get an education in the entire world. 
[02:34:00]  He busted out in a rocket ship.  He went from a world of gang violence and drugs to everything that Palo Alto and Stanford University represent.  But they're calling him a thug.  Right.  Because he talks shit to a guy.  People are fucking dopes.  Well, they went nuts on Twitter.  So, now, America, let's talk about Richard Sherman in the NFL.  Let's talk about the Stanford graduate from Compton who has never been arrested, never cursed in a post-game interview,  never been accused of being a dirty player, started his own charitable nonprofit,  and won an appeal in the only thing close to a smudge on his record. 
[02:34:30]  So.  Damn.  There you go.  Yeah, so basically, a bunch of babies don't like the fact that he talks shit to a guy who he genuinely doesn't like and who genuinely doesn't like him.  Right.  So, look, I would have thought it was better if he didn't because it was like that moment you want to concentrate on the Seahawks.  But it doesn't make him a fucking thug or a bum.  He sounds very articulate in his interviews, as a matter of fact.  Yeah, can you call the guy a thug?  He was listening to a few of his other interviews. 
[02:35:00]  Sounds good.  Yeah.  Yeah, educated.  He sounds educated.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hi, who's this?  It's me again, please die.  Listen, don't want to talk to you for a minute, okay?  Why?  We've got a big interview that's about to go down.  Wait, hold on a second.  Hold on.  Did you see the boat movie?  Did you see Captain Phillips?  Captain Phillips?  No, I did not.  Okay.  Well, we just have a question for you.  Make sure you give it a good answer.  You didn't see Captain Phillips, but you know Tom Hanks is in it, right? 
[02:35:30]  No.  Tom Hanks is in the movie.  You live with Tom Hanks, don't you?  I don't live with Tom Hanks.  You don't live with Tom Hanks.  Okay.  And Bill wanted to talk to us.  I'm sorry.  No, go ahead.  No, no, go ahead.  Answer.  No, go ahead.  Hold on.  Bill wanted to.  Hold on a second.  Bill wanted to talk to us?  Yes.  Now, which bill is this?  Oh, we have to.  Okay, put him on.  All right.  We have an interview.  Yeah, we got an interview.  Steve and Philly, go ahead. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, Ope, I want to know what a 4.2 GPA is.  I didn't know you could get over a 4.2 GPA.  Hey, asshole, why are you calling me an idiot when I'm reading it from an article, you stupid fuck?  Uh-oh.  That was how it was written.  I saw that.  I'm so done with these idiots.  I'm so done with these idiots.  And you can get over a 4.0 these days.  And you can get over a 4.0, you fuck.  Yeah.  It's called, I don't know, extra credit or something.  Yeah, there is a, they wrote 4.2 in the article.  It says right there, 4.2 GPA. 
[02:36:30]  Yep.  Maybe it's at a 5.  And that's second.  No, it's not.  No.  4.5 is the highest.  What do you mean?  A 4.5 grade point average.  I thought 4.0 is the highest.  Without the extra credit shit.  No, with the extra credit, the highest you can get is a 4.5.  Oh, so they don't go higher than a 4.5.  They don't go higher than that.  Even with extra credit.  But it isn't 4.0.  No.  You know, you could go higher.  I got a 17.  Fuck enough of these fucking idiots.  They're everywhere.  Yeah.  We got the boat guy.  Yes. 
[02:37:00]  There he is.  Take a seat.  Hello, sir.  Wow.  Make yourself comfy.  Big star in the studio.  How are you, buddy?  All right.  I'm good.  We're on the, we're trying to figure out, is it, uh,  Barkhad Abdi, is that how you say it, or am I saying it wrong?  It's Barkhad Abdi.  Okay.  Close.  I just saw you on the SAG Awards, and now you're in our studio.  That's pretty cool for us.  Not so cool for you.  A bit of a drop-off, but.  Making all the awards show.  Thanks for having me.  Uh, no problem.  Yeah, right on, man.  How, how are the awards shows?  Pretty, uh, pretty fun, or?  Yeah, it's fun.  It's fun.  You meet a lot of different people, and. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  Are they, uh, the people seem to be drinking a little bit at that, um, that SAG Award thing,  were they?  Yeah.  We were having fun.  A little tipsy.  That's cool.  You, uh, it's an amazing story.  You were driving a cab in, in Minnesota, right?  And now you're nominated for an Oscar.  I mean, how did you get this gig?  There was an open casting call in, uh, Minneapolis, where I live.  Uh, Tom Hanks' film came on, on TV, so I decided to go there and, and give it a chance. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  What, what'd they have you do?  Just, uh, read some lines, or?  Just read some lines at first, and after that, they gave me a script.  They assigned me to a character, so.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We gotta slow down.  That's just an amazing story.  I know.  Were you doing any acting before this?  No.  That's what I'm saying.  So there's an open call for a Tom Hanks movie in your city, and you go and you get it, and  you have no acting experience?  Yeah.  That's mind-blowing. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, that doesn't just happen.  But what made you, what made you go, I'm gonna try out for this?  You know, I loved acting.  Right.  I loved acting, and I decided to go there.  But you never acted?  They came to my neighborhood.  No, I, I never acted.  But I did some music videos, and just short films, just my own stuff, you know?  Oh, okay.  They wanted guys who were like, who were Somalian, and spoke, I guess, what's the language, Somali?  Somali, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  And there's probably not that many of those guys in Hollywood.  Wow.  There is nothing.  So, when you grew up in Somali, how accurate is our impression of it, compared to what it  is?  Is it as bad as everybody says it is?  Or as dangerous?  In Somali?  Yeah.  It's dangerous.  Piracy.  Yeah, it's dangerous.  And people talk about it as well.  There's a lot of word of mouth going on.  Did you know any pirates when you were growing up?  I left Somali when I was seven.  Oh, okay.  When I was seven? 
[02:39:30]  There was no pirates then.  Yeah.  Have you gone back?  No.  Yeah, that's weird, like, just to leave a place and know you can't go back because you'll  be a target for kidnapping, I guess.  I bet they know you over there now.  Yeah, I bet.  But do you think that they would, like, if you played the kidnappers, would they, or  the pirate, would they like that and find you to be a celebrity, or would that annoy  them and anger them?  Well, I have no idea.  I'm going to find out.  Are you going back?  I'm going back.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I want to go back, yeah.  Just do a documentary or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, are you going to get other acting roles?  I'm reading some scripts now, so.  Yeah.  That'd be cool.  And the other guys that were playing the Pirates along with you, they got them the  same way through just an open casting?  Yeah.  We're friends.  Oh, you're all friends?  We are from the same neighborhood, yeah.  Wow, that's so weird, man.  So after the first day, we did the audition, and the second day, when we came to audition 
[02:40:30]  again, they told us to be part of a group.  Uh-huh.  And they were already standing next to me.  Oh, God.  So you had the group.  They were the closest people to me.  So I was like, what do you have?  What do you have?  And after we realized we each had different characters, we auditioned together.  Oh, wow.  We just created our own group, and we were the same ever since.  We would even go back home, and we practiced.  Wow.  Was it scary for you, or is it so overwhelming that it's not even frightening when you get  the movie?  Because it's like, you know, you haven't geared up your whole life to do this. 
[02:41:00]  All of a sudden, you're driving a cab, and now you're in a movie.  Are you nervous, or are you not like...  Oh, that was very nerve-wracking.  Second they said, I met the director, we all got the part together in L.A.  That's when I started being like...  Yeah, yeah.  Real scared.  Like, can I really do this?  Did you blow any lines?  What was that?  Did you screw up any lines?  Like, did you forget your lines at all? 
[02:41:30]  Of course.  There was times I would forget the lines, but Paul Greengrass was nice enough to let me  just make it my own.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's why I'm the captain now.  I just came out with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that wasn't in the script.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That is a good one.  Yeah.  What made you just say that?  Because that's what everyone's talking about.  You know, honestly, I have no idea when I even said it.  Right.  That's the crazy part.  Like, I don't know what cut was it. 
[02:42:00]  Right, right.  The first take, the second take, I...  No idea.  But it just popped out.  Didn't that make it into the trailers, too?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was huge.  That was like the big one.  That, um...  You'd heard about the story when it happened, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember the story, the actual story happening.  Yeah.  Yeah, on TV.  And, like, was it just kind of a, oh, okay, that's happening?  Or did you kind of pay attention because it's kind of from where you're from?  Yeah, I paid attention. 
[02:42:30]  It was...  Because that time, there was a lot of piracy.  But that was the first piracy on an American ship.  Yeah.  Did you have to do any research on the guy that you played?  Did you study about him?  Yeah.  You know, all I seen from him was when he's smiling.  Oh, okay.  When he gets cut and he's smiling.  Right, right.  Yeah, he did that smile, like, eh.  Yeah.  Well, he was the lucky one.  Yeah, that was like, you know, there's a joke somebody made about that saying that that's 
[02:43:00]  how fast he made it to America.  That's kind of good.  Yeah.  You, uh...  Wow, that's...  It is an amazing story.  And do you find that he's a sympathetic character, somebody to be liked or pitied, or do you just  see him as a common criminal?  You know, he is a criminal, that's for sure.  But I understand, you know, like, why? 
[02:43:30]  Because he lived in a country that had nothing.  Mm-hmm.  No government, no work, no school.  And he sees this as his only chance.  Right.  So it's like a gangster that we understand why he is a gangster.  You know, rather than someone that had chance or, you know, reasons to be a good person or, 
[02:44:00]  you know, better their life, but they choose the wrong way.  Right, right.  You're saying a guy like this had only really one way to make it, and that was it?  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, I mean, there's always a different way to make it.  That's what I believe.  But, you know, there was no much chance for him at the time.  At least hearing about pirates, people that, you know, become millionaires as well.  Yeah, yeah.  They were kind of around people that had made a lot of money. 
[02:44:30]  A lot of money, yeah.  Through the piracy.  Another amazing thing, you didn't meet Tom Hanks until your first scene with Tom Hanks,  right?  That's right.  That's, were you nervous?  All of a sudden, he walks in the room, and you're like, holy shit, that's Tom Hanks?  Yeah, that was...  You're shaking your head no.  You weren't nervous at all?  No, I was very nervous.  Oh, okay.  That was the scariest scene for me.  Yeah, because they decided to not have you meet him until, you know, the scene was being  shot.  Yeah, that was, you know, really nerve-wracking, and I had to become the character. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I had to become the character.  But were you sitting there as the character going, oh my God, that's Tom Hanks, I've seen  him in a million movies?  Deep down, yeah.  That's why I wasn't really looking at him, looking past him.  But, you know that, when they say cut, I was like, I can't believe I'm making a scene  with him.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What was the first scene you shot with him?  Was it, yeah, because you guys have a bunch of stuff together.  What was the first moment you actually shot?  On the bridge.  Oh, it was the bridge.  It was when you actually meet him. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Oh, they shot it in kind of chronological order.  Yeah.  What do you think they need to do to fix Somalia?  Because it seems like it's almost an unfixable situation.  There's, like you said, no government.  It's just Wallace.  You know, it's just changed the people that's claiming.  To be in law, in order right now.  Because it seems like it's greedy people.  You know, the people that only care about their own pockets.  And they blame other people for that.  So, there is the innocent ones. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, there's no real investment in the country.  It's the warlords and crooked leaders that are just kind of grabbing it all up.  And you were there long enough to see the war break out.  And you talk about how you and your brother would see the dead bodies.  Dead bodies.  And, you know, we heard the gunshots.  So we sleep.  And you guys could recognize what guns were being used just by the shots you heard?  We can, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  The distinctive sound of the AK-47.  Yeah.  Da, da, da, da.  Yeah.  You can tell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how did you make it to America?  How did that work out for you?  We came to Yemen when I was seven years old after we witnessed a whole year of the war.  We made it to Yemen because my dad was a teacher in Yemen.  Mm-hmm.  So we came there and we lived in Yemen for another seven years.  Oh, wow.  Then we found the American Visa Lottery. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  With the American Visa Lottery?  What's that?  Yeah.  It's a lottery visa, you know, that's done by the American embassy in Yemen.  Really?  I'm not sure it's only Yemen, but yeah, it's done in a few other countries as well.  So, you know, you just fill it out and you see your chances.  Wow.  So every year there's certain people that...  A winner.  Oh, you've had two amazing things happen.  You win the Visa Lottery and your first movies with Tom Hanks. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  So how has the woman situation been since you've been in the movie?  Have you noticed that you're doing better with women than you did before you were in the movie?  Yes, I realized that.  Yeah, no shit.  That's got to be the best part of just instant fame.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The fact that the chicks now are paying attention to you.  Yeah.  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden they like you.  Amazing.  Do you have a girlfriend or are you just kind of, you know, mixing around?  Yeah, no girlfriend.  No, just different. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I understand.  I understand.  What are you going to do if you win the Oscar?  Have you thought about it?  I can't even think about that, honestly.  I'm still shocked by the fact that I'm nominated.  Right.  Yeah, that's insane.  Pretty cool.  Have you seen the other movies?  Like Jared Leto and the other guys who are nominated?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen Jared.  Jared Leto is amazing.  He's filmed by his cloud.  He's amazing.  He's a friend of mine.  I like his whole Hollywood now.  He's a friend of mine.  He's a friend of mine. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, he's cool.  What kind of music videos did you do?  So my music videos, I did some hip-hop.  You were in the videos?  You actually did?  What did you do?  I was behind the camera.  I was the cameraman.  I was the editor.  Oh, you're not a musician.  Yeah, so you've been interested in film.  For a while.  Yeah.  Who do you want to play next?  I don't know. 
[02:49:00]  I was just good stories.  I want to narrate good stories.  Are they only giving you scripts for Somali guys or other things now?  Is it only guys that are...  I should have some Nigerian script now.  So I'm practicing the African accent.  Oh, I don't even know if anyone would notice in the United States.  He'd be like, oh, that's not a Nigerian accent.  Because we're all like, I don't fucking know.  So a Nigerian.  That'd be good. 
[02:49:30]  One of those guys that write the emails that say that you want $10 million and you just got  to send them your bank account number.  Yeah.  So your family didn't have the poverty issues that a lot of them...  If your dad was a teacher, at least he had some kind of a steady work in Somalia, right?  In Yemen.  In Yemen, yeah.  What did he teach?  He was a teacher.  He teached science and math.  Were they strict with you growing up or no?  So, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  He was strict.  Religious?  Religious, yeah.  I mean, religious was there, but he was more strict in school.  I had to study all the classes of next year in the summer.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Is Yemen more fun than the United States?  I would say no, right?  You know, it's different.  You know, I was a kid at the time and the only fun to me was playing soccer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you chew that?  What was it called?  That stuff? 
[02:50:30]  Cat?  Is that what it's called?  They chew it in a movie, too.  It's this...  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know they had a Somalia.  It's cat.  It makes your gums really red.  Oh, right, right, right.  What exactly is it?  I know it fucks the whole country up.  It's really a good drug.  Yeah, it's caffeine.  It's a lot of caffeine.  Is that all that is?  It's like an amphetamine, yeah.  You know, it just keeps people awake and they talk and, yeah.  That was pretty good.  The guy that was driving the boat, the little lifeboat, he was intense. 
[02:51:00]  He was crazy.  I'm hot, I'm hot.  Yeah, he just kept eating that stuff and...  Yeah.  He was a fucking nut.  Does it make your gums bleed or something?  Like, it's really...  Yeah, because you see all those smiling pictures.  There's so many of those guys from Yemen that have, like, really red gums around their teeth  and it's from chewing this drug old thing.  Yeah, in Yemen, they overdo it.  It's how the Yemen...  They just...  You think, like, the whole nation is doing it.  Wasn't there a problem with the water in Yemen, too?  Like, they were running out of water?  There was some kind of weird shit happening there, no? 
[02:51:30]  Water is something about water.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Whenever I try to discuss world issues, I'm really good for one question.  Like, here's where I lost it in the interview.  When I walked in, I said, so you're from Somalia originally.  I was correct on that.  I have no idea what I'm talking about after that.  I'm just unraveling.  We really are terrible at this.  So, was Tom Hanks nice?  God, three idiots we are.  So, how was Conan to be interviewed?  Let's just say I'm better at this guy.  Sam told us you were rapping and the other things.  We thought you were, like, a rapper.  Oh, Sam, what did you know? 
[02:52:00]  You did say that.  Well, good luck, man.  I mean, you're...  Well, the Blu-ray comes out today.  Yes, the Blu-ray.  Captain Phillips' Blu-ray is out today.  We got it in our hands, which is very cool.  And the movie was excellent, and I wish you luck with the Oscar, because it's quite an  amazing story.  It's a great story.  But you'll have a great career now, because Timothy Hutton was nominated for his first  film in Ordinary People, I think, and he's worked ever since, so you'll have a lot  of years of work out of it.  Your next movie should be your story, because it's pretty amazing what you've been to already.  That's a good story.  And you're only 25. 
[02:52:30]  25, my God.  28.  28 now, okay.  All right.  Well, best of luck, man.  Thank you.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you so much.  And it's out today, and again, how do you say the name?  It's...  Barkhad.  Barkhad Abdi.  Yeah.  Good luck, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  After 20 years of broadcasting excellence, Opie and Anthony have created a show that doesn't  allow a moment to be missed.  So don't.  Catch what you didn't hear, or listen to it all over again.  The Opie and Anthony Encore, starting at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, 8 a.m. Pacific Time, 
[02:53:00]  and all throughout the day.  Only here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  It's real.  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  All right.  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock had a tough time taking pictures. 
[02:53:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Barkhad.  From the Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  Yeah.  He comes in with the camera after every guest we have.  And then today, I noticed with everybody, he takes the picture, and then he goes, wait,  wait, one more.  Right.  And I'm thinking to myself, why is he taking two pictures of everybody?  And then he explained it.  You've got to explain to the audience what's going on. 
[02:54:00]  E-Rock, what was going on with the two pictures?  Well, with this studio...  Yeah, peck a face.  Holy shit, Chippa.  Well, with this studio being, you know, mostly glass and mostly black wall covering,  some guests don't photograph well in this studio.  So you're saying that perhaps the darker levels in the photo kind of blend into each other.  That's what happens, and it throws off the flash.  Ah, the flash doesn't know what to do. 
[02:54:30]  So really black guys?  Yeah.  Real dark black guys, there's a problem photographing.  Yeah.  I heard this, though, from even Hollywood directors.  They have to make special...  Filters?  Yeah, lighting and filters and whatnot when they film black people, really dark black people.  It's just, it's basic science, you know.  Science!  Science.  It's photographing something darker or lighter.  You're going to have to adjust accordingly.  And in contrast to us, who are the complete opposite... 
[02:55:00]  Right.  ...again, throws off the flash.  So it's either really too bright or it's too dark.  You mean us, the chosen race?  Right.  If you want to call it that.  So...  The privileged?  The privileged?  I went through with taking two photos, so this way, the first one usually fucks up,  and then the second one gets it like that.  So the camera fucking...  It takes one photo for the camera to learn what's going on, and it adjusts accordingly.  Right.  So you were taking two pictures... 
[02:55:30]  Of everybody.  Yeah.  Because I've learned over the years that this is just always a problem.  So...  How did you find out?  Who was the first person you found this out with?  The first person was back at the old XM studio with Michael K. Williams.  Michael K. Williams.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  His first appearance.  That's...  That's right.  He's very dark-skinned.  Good point, E-Rock.  Yes, yes.  I've just learned over the years that...  Who else would have been an issue, I guess?  I was thinking of putting together a collage. 
[02:56:00]  A collage.  Of photos that had to...  No, before they were fixed.  Wait.  There was one where you did the color adjustment, and then it made us look shitty.  Yeah.  Who was that again?  You had a light and everything...  Oh, who the fuck was that?  Yeah, he lightened everything up, and we were all...  Do you remember?  There's been a few.  I don't remember off the top of my head.  There was somebody, though, that you couldn't even see...  Who's the guy from Boogie Nights?  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle.  I think might have been one of them.  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle will fuck up a picture.  Mary and Barry might have been one.  Mary and Barry. 
[02:56:30]  Mary and Barry.  All right.  That's true.  And there was a setting on there.  So, I'm going to go through and see if I...  I sent you all the good photos, so you should all have them now.  Yeah, I see that.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I want the bad one, too.  You want the bad one?  I want both, because I want to be able to compare.  I want the bad photo.  I want the bad photos.  Okay.  Yeah, let me see that.  Oh, there's Sam Roberts.  Let's see.  All right.  Sam looking a little light.  I can't see, Sam.  Turn that to the left.  That's not me.  That's good.  I don't like your dumb eyes being open.  Sam doesn't know how to just take a picture.  No, no.  I'm taking lots of pictures.  Yeah, you're taking lots of pictures, but you always look like you're fucking making 
[02:57:00]  a promo poster for Douche Magazine.  Oh, he does have some hamster teeth on him, doesn't he?  Oh, my God.  And then someone has to talk about gums.  I know.  Jimmy is talking about how that stuff fucks up.  He makes the gums, and he's all gums.  It's like that scene in Austin Powers where he's going, moly, moly, moly.  You're talking about people's gums over there, and it's like, oh, my God. 
[02:57:30]  But his gums weren't messed up for me.  What?  He had big gums, but that had nothing to do with the drug.  The drug makes your gums red.  Yeah.  That wasn't him.  I just would not want anyone to bring up gums.  Oh, my God.  Don't even bring up gums.  Well, I didn't know what to do after.  It was a tough interview.  Lots of good colors going on on those guns.  Yeah.  Looked like a fucking Doberman Pinscher's gums.  He was nice.  He has an amazing story, but really doesn't know how to tell it yet.  Well, he's, you know, English is his second language. 
[02:58:00]  I mean, Somalia, when the war breaks out, I mean, he walked out of his house and just saw dead bodies with his brother.  Then he gets to go to Yemen where his father's teaching.  Then he lives there for seven years.  He's got a strict father.  And then he wins the lottery.  A lottery to come to America.  America.  And then he's driving a cab, and then he gets the movie.  But he's looking for a Somali.  But that's pretty much it.  He doesn't really know how to tell that story. 
[02:58:30]  No, it's hard to add in the details.  That was a tough one.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy, though.  I've seen him on shows.  It's the same interview.  Yeah.  People ask him the same things.  He says the same things.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  It's Lady Diagano.  Oh, my God, with this lady.  Oh, my God.  Is this the 1100th time you've called this morning?  No, actually, it's the first time.  Actually, it's the second time.  Actually, it's the third or fourth time. 
[02:59:00]  Bill wants to talk to you for a minute.  I know.  No, we've got a radio show to do.  Yeah, I know.  What do you think this is?  What, are you calling from the roof?  Yeah, you calling from the roof?  No, he's not calling from the roof.  He's calling from the kitchen.  Oh.  Hold on a second.  No!  No!  Hold on.  What?  Why does she think I'm talking for a minute?  No!  Lady Diagano, hold on.  Before we do that, we're trying to ask you a couple of questions.  Okay, go ahead.  Because apparently now you're a professional tap dancer.  I'm not a tap dancer. 
[02:59:30]  Oh.  What happened?  Yeah, but I just ordered some turkey.  I had some turkey.  So?  That's good.  I love turkey.  Which one would turkey?  Shaped like one.  Why?  Nothing.  I love turkey.  So why are you holding your lung in your hand?  Why am I holding my what?  I'm not holding no lung in my hand.  Oh.  Yeah, but you're best friends with a bunny rabbit.  My best friend is a bunny rabbit? 
[03:00:00]  Marriott?  No, she's not a bunny rabbit.  No, she's not.  I thought she would.  No, she's a hippo.  What the hell?  What else do you want to know?  Huh?  What else do you want to know?  Well, Marriott's not even your best friend.  Marriott said her best friend is a Somali pirate.  No.  What else?  What else?  Shut up.  Be quiet.  I'm fucking sick of you.  Exactly.  We don't know what you're talking about.  Right.  We were talking to the guy from the boat movie. 
[03:00:30]  That you'd never heard of.  Which, by the way, she called in the middle of.  Right, right.  But we didn't take her call.  Hold on a second.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Excuse me.  Stand up for yourself on your hind legs.  What they call belligerent drunk.  I didn't know we were talking to the Queen of England.  I'm not the Queen of England.  Oh.  She's reached that belligerent drunk point.  I'm not the Queen of England.  She's not the Queen of England.  She's the pig of Jersey. 
[03:01:00]  Elizabeth New Jersey.  Yeah, that's me.  No, we said the pig of New Jersey.  You slob.  What?  You're a slob.  Yeah.  I am not a slob.  You've changed.  Ever since you moved to Hawaii two hours ago, you've changed.  I was never in Hawaii.  Oh.  Oh.  But then why would you move there if you've never been there?  How could I move there if I'd never been there?  Exactly.  That's why I'm asking you. 
[03:01:30]  You did it two hours ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  So are you up to a million beers?  Getting close.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Getting close to a million beers.  Yeah.  All right.  You're pretty buzzed right about now, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would say so.  Well, that's only because you live with Bill, who was an astronaut at one point.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  He wants to talk to you.  Oh.  What?  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[03:02:00]  Lady Di.  Hold on.  What?  What space shuttle mission was Bill on?  You ask him.  Oh.  He's right here.  Okay.  Hold on.  What do you need from us?  Why'd she call?  Oh, excuse me.  I don't eat nothing.  He wants the recipe for ricin.  You're pretty obnoxious, Bill.  I'm really getting this vibe from you. 
[03:02:30]  You're like a real tough guy.  No bullshit with this guy.  No.  All right.  Don't fuck with me.  I'll fuck with you.  Yeah, but I don't buy that.  You're like a fuckin' telephone tough guy.  You think he's a pussy in real life?  Yeah.  You sound like a little fuckin' pussy.  I do?  Yeah.  What?  You do.  Oh.  You sound like a little fuckin' pussy.  You let that fat piece of shit... 
[03:03:00]  You're bringing up the fuck on me?  You let that fat piece of shit boss you around?  Oh, come on.  He's in the other room.  Because you're a little pussy boy.  What'd you do?  Would you?  You fuckin'  Your parents raise you all  Your whole life  Giving you money?  You never worked a hard day in your life,  You fuck.  I never worked a hard day in my whole life?  Well, you said it.  At least you just admitted it.  No!  Face.  You guys are a bunch of fuckin' jerks. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, wow.  Ooh, you got me there.  Pussy boy's got insults.  You got me there,  You fuckin' queen.  Excuse me, I'm the queen, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a real queen.  I'm a man.  A queen is a lady.  Yeah, like you, you cocksucker.  No, I eat pussy.  Oh, no, you don't.  No, I don't?  Yeah, you got pussy right in the house,  And you're not even fuckin' that slob Diana.  What do you do?  Jack off lookin' at fuckin' 
[03:04:00]  Justin Bieber photos?  Oh, you guys are a trip.  Yeah.  I got a 29-year-old girlfriend,  And I got a 41-year-old girlfriend.  What?  Diana Elizabeth name.  Okay, that's it.  What's his name?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Hey, you asked me what is his name?  Yeah.  Okay, fine.  Why don't you ask me how big his dick is?  Yeah, how big is Pekka? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  He's getting your bag, brother.  How big is his dick?  This guy's good.  Why don't you just tell me how deep your asshole is,  And I'll know how big his dick is.  Oh, fuck.  You like that.  I didn't say that.  I was pointing.  That was pretty good.  Oh, really?  Hey, Bill, fuck Lady Di.  You're the star now.  You're the star now.  Right? 
[03:05:00]  You're the star.  We don't need Lady Di anymore.  Di said you wanted to call us and ask us something.  What do you want?  Yeah, make it quick.  No, make it quick.  Yeah, I'm just supposed to be up on the show on February or something.  Yeah, February, Lady Di and Marianne are coming back on the show.  What, you want to join them?  We're doing the second super show.  You want to be on the super show?  When's the super show?  What's that?  February 7th.  Well, that's when we have a bunch of people up.  We're going to have a little party atmosphere live on the air.  Right. 
[03:05:30]  I think you'd fit in perfectly.  Much like that dick fits in your fucking mouth.  Oh, no, no, no.  He's all right.  This guy's all right.  Hilarious.  One end.  I'll tell you what, guys.  Yeah.  There ain't nobody big enough to shut my mouth.  Oh.  Okay, look out.  Let's get Lady Di back on the phone here, Bill.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll see you for the super show.  Yeah.  I'm the second degree black belt, third degree, I mean, three-time golden gloves. 
[03:06:00]  There ain't nobody in my mouth.  Fucking golden gloves.  Not bad, Bill.  Look out.  You're an old bruiser.  Yeah.  What, you got a cauliflower brain?  No.  I ran a whole corporation for 25 years.  Oh, really?  Queer corp?  Yeah.  He ran Dumbbell Inc.  And that's where he met her.  You guys are, I tell you what, you guys are 20, but you're nothing but a bunch of assholes. 
[03:06:30]  Right?  Well, let me tell you something.  The jerk store called, and they're running out of you.  Huh?  All right.  Let's get Lady Di back on the phone.  No, I'll be up there, and I'll tell you what.  All right.  Yep.  Yep.  He's probably going to end up kicking our asses, you idiot.  No.  He's a good egg.  We like you, Bill.  Especially now that we know you're a seven-degree black belt.  I'll tell you what, then.  Yeah.  You got a hair on your asshole like a pussy's got. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  And I'll fuck you.  I do.  What are you, a seventh-degree black liver?  I do.  No.  I don't drink.  Well, yes, you do.  You just said you drank beer.  Yeah, I'm not a drink.  I'm not an alcoholic.  Oh.  Alcoholics go to meetings.  I don't have time for that.  There's too many happy hours around town.  It's an old Jim 14 show.  I don't even go out.  You don't go out?  No.  What are you, a shut-in?  What are you, a hoarder?  A hoarder of fat, stupid people? 
[03:07:30]  He's hoarding monsters.  Monsters.  You guys try to be funny, but that was funny.  Yeah.  That was fucking...  All right.  We got to go, Bill.  We got to go.  Bill, we got to go.  Put Lady Di back on the phone, please.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's me again.  All right.  Lady Di.  Oh, boy.  Can you...  Lady Di!  What?  What?  What? 
[03:08:00]  What?  What?  What?  Could you tell us about the time you wrestled Bruno Sammartino again?  Excuse me?  What?  Tell us about the time you wrestled Bruno Sammartino.  I never wrestled Bruno Sammartino.  Oh.  What was that?  I didn't know that.  You sound really buzzed, Di.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, well, it's snowing out and everything like that, so I think you're...  That's cool.  Yeah, why not?  What the heck?  It's snowing.  If it wasn't, you'd celebrate the good weather.  So how are you supposed to drive a bus to Florida today? 
[03:08:30]  I'm not going to drive a bus to Florida.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  There's nothing for me to drive today.  I have my truck out there.  Bill said he's going to be up in the studio with us.  Yeah, it was fascinating.  It was an amazing fucking...  Can we do it another day?  Any other day in February I can do it.  This is the only weekend I'm gone.  Yeah, we should redo it so Jimmy can be here. 
[03:09:00]  I want to be here.  Jimmy's got to be here.  It's a promotion deal.  What?  With who?  With who?  Excuse me.  He won't give a fuck.  Can I be changing around?  He'll fucking show up for another one.  Yeah, we can try to.  But that's what it is.  When did they pick the date?  Uh, last Friday.  Yeah, so why don't you...  She's just rambling on.  Rambling on and on.  You're rambling on, Anthony.  Stop.  Hey, you cunt.  Don't fucking get snippy with me, you fat lump of shit.  She's right, man. 
[03:09:30]  I'll fucking piss on you.  I'll fucking piss on you.  You twat.  Don't get snippy with me.  Marion's birthday.  You belligerent drunk.  No, she's right.  Go ahead, Di.  You tell him.  That's Marion's birthday, almost.  Who cares?  That's why you got mad at Anthony?  Who gives a fuck?  Fuck.  Now, tell us about Marion's birthday.  Yeah, all about it.  Marion's birthday is February 11th.  She's going to be on a cruise.  February 11th.  Did you hear that slur?  She's going to be on a cruise. 
[03:10:00]  Is she going to be on a cruise?  That's it.  Is she going die-watching?  I don't know what she's going to do.  Yeah, that's good.  Hope it's the Achille Laurel.  They push her in her dumb fucking stupid, awful yellow wig, her Simpsons wig head, off the boat.  The wave pushes the boat back to shore, because she's fat.  February 7th is a few days before her birthday, so.  All right.  Listen to her slurring now.  All right, slurring. 
[03:10:30]  You're in the mood.  Yeah.  February 7th.  Yeah.  Right at February 7th.  February 7th.  February 7th.  February 7th.  Damn, Di.  You are a fucking lightweight.  How many beers deep are you?  I don't know about five.  Five?  Five beers.  It's 10.30 in the morning.  10.30 a.m.  You're five beers deep.  How many do you buy?  How many beers do you go through in a week?  Yeah.  Two billion?  I don't think I know.  It's got to be about.  I don't know.  I lost count after a while, but I don't know. 
[03:11:00]  But it's got to be close to two billion.  I have no idea.  It could be.  Oh, you fucking drunk.  I don't know.  You ever just go into a quiet room and listen to your brain cells pop like pop rocks?  Pop twice.  Damn.  I hate that.  Why doesn't that work in comedy, Jimmy?  It's so weird.  It doesn't work.  There's something about giving away one of the words of the punchlines. 
[03:11:30]  I don't know why.  It just wrecks it.  It does.  And on Twitter, how many times do you struggle to get that?  To get another word.  You got to like, I can't use that.  I use that word.  Oh, that's fucking funny.  Yeah, I don't know.  I usually talk into the phone with the Twitter thing.  I talk into the phone.  She thinks we were talking to her.  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  You should talk into the phone.  Oh, so you use the voice activation thing and you talk and...  So you don't even type out your own tweets?  So you sit there and go like, hi, it's Diane. 
[03:12:00]  She's even lazy with Twitter.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sometimes I type...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Sometimes I tweet things out.  Like what?  Like what?  Yeah.  Like whatever.  That's great, right?  Yeah.  I answer them and whatever it is.  Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I don't.  You know, if it's a stupid question, I'm not going to answer that.  Like what's a stupid question people have asked you?  Good question.  How many naughty ices have I had today?  That's not a stupid question. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, that's the stupid question?  Yeah, so what, do you have trouble finding the comma button?  Do you know how many she'd have to have drank to need a comma?  Over 999.  Exactly, Jimmy.  That's a lot.  That's a sure thing.  Stupid questions like that.  Oh, nice.  Nice cough.  That's great.  What happened?  You still smoking?  Yeah, unfortunately, yes.  What are you smoking?  God.  Mavericks. 
[03:13:00]  Maverick menthol.  Maverick menthol and Natty Ice.  Natty Ice and Maverick menthol.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  Keeping two shitty companies in business.  Wow.  What?  Maverick menthol.  Her breath smells like the fucking toilet and fucking Captain Phillips boat.  A bunch of Somali dumps and urine and fucking bloody gums spits.  Oh, stop it.  Come on, Jimmy.  Mavericks.  I like that dog. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  How much do a pack of Mavericks go for?  Right now, about $7.  Seven bucks.  And what's a box of Marlboro go for?  Marlboro?  Well, we don't smoke Marlboro.  I don't care, and I didn't ask you that.  I'm just saying.  You smoke Maverick menthol.  It's like seven bucks a pack.  She can afford cigarettes.  How much is a box of Marlboro?  Marlboro?  I don't know.  About what?  Bill?  $8? 
[03:14:00]  I'm here at $10, $11.  $10 or $11.  Now we're talking New Jersey, not New York.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  These are friend prices.  There's a big difference right there.  Yes, exactly.  One bridge.  I heard you get your Mavericks on the moon.  No.  Oh.  Oh.  She doesn't get her Mavericks on the moon, apparently.  No, I don't get my Mavericks on the moon.  Oh, she almost got that one.  Yeah.  So let me ask you, why Mavericks?  What kind of fucking white trash ciggy is that? 
[03:14:30]  They're cheap.  They're cheap cigarettes.  That's, you know, that's why.  For a cheap person.  Right.  Yeah, well, you know, I have no choice but to be cheap.  A natty ice.  Yeah, you could stop drinking so much.  And you could get a job.  How about that?  Marry.  I mean, marry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Is she drunk?  Listen, listen.  It's Anthony, by the way.  Just keep reciting everyone you know until you hit.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Opie and Jim.  What?  I've been trying to get a job. 
[03:15:00]  Trust me, there is no work around here.  There's no work for fucking out of shape alcoholic slobs.  Exactly.  Oh, that's not even the point.  I thought you were going to go, that's not nice.  How is that not the point?  People can smell you a mile away.  They don't want to hire someone like you.  Exactly.  You get up at 7 a.m. and you crack yourself in natty ice.  Boy, where do we hire you? 
[03:15:30]  The inside of your underpants looks like a honey bun wrapper.  That doesn't stand something.  I don't go to these places.  Pull yourself up by your hoof straps and get a job.  Wait, you think you walk in these places and they can't tell you're an alcoholic?  I don't know.  With early stages of edema?  Yeah, okay.  That fucking, yeah.  The W.C. Fields nose.  Right.  Ah, yes.  I've come for some employment, my friend.  Ah, yes. 
[03:16:00]  Fucking blue veins popping all around her nose.  Perhaps the dollar store will hire me on.  With her maverick fucking cigarette breath.  Oh, there's a maverick hanging out of her mouth.  Probably just fucking her yellow fingernails.  What time are the cigarette breaks here?  Right.  How much do I get paid?  When do I leave?  All the important questions that get you hired.  Is there a daddy ice in the vending machine?  How long is the lunch break?  Is it enough time to grab a daddy ice or two? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  How about if I want to take a nice nap on the forklift while it's running?  Yeah, you're a real catch for a potential employer.  Exactly.  You have to explain why you killed that girl in SeaWorld?  You know what?  I will really surprise you guys one day.  I will get a job.  Yawn.  You're not going to get a job.  No.  Yeah, exactly.  Lady Tilikum. 
[03:17:00]  You are just...  I will surprise you guys.  No.  I don't think so.  All right, we got to go, man.  Because, you know, we got real responsibilities.  Bill's going to come home, like, about Schmidt one day.  See her shoe askew.  Except there won't be any vacuum because I don't apply housework.  Yes.  Yeah.  There'll be a fucking taco next to her hand.  Natty Ice rolling on the floor.  I will try to get Bill up there with us, okay?  Oh, we look forward to it.  Yeah.  I'll just...  I hope he busts her nose. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Lady Di, thank you.  All right.  Okay.  Wait, hold on.  He said he will be there because he wants to bust your fucking balls.  Cool.  All right.  Great.  After he sucks on him.  That fucking...  Oh, you wait and see.  All right.  All right.  Lady.  I'll talk to you later, okay?  Yeah, later.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  All right.  Let me say hi to Mohammed in Virginia Mohammed.  Hello, what book?  Hello, what book?  Mohammed.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, hello. 
[03:18:00]  How are you guys?  I want them to know, where the hell did you meet this Diane, Rod?  Yeah, how did we?  This one, I don't remember how we met her.  Yeah, and just another couple of fans of the show that might have called up one day.  Wow, I don't know how we met her.  Yeah.  Don't we have the first ever show that they were on?  The scary part is a listener will know.  Oh, yeah, they'll know.  They'll know, but I swear to you, I don't remember how we met this slob.  I think it was a screening of Battle of the Gargantuans, and people were swarming them for autographs outside. 
[03:18:30]  Hello, he referenced her as a monster.  Do you know how bad a monster is?  Oh, let's see.  Yellow?  Oh.  Hi.  How are you?  Somethingmania.com congratulating him on his 10,000th post.  Hey, bitch, he's busy.  Stop fucking bothering him.  Don't mind the background noise.  Yeah, don't mind it.  We're fucking busy working. 
[03:19:00]  There's a scene going on here.  This cocksucker's working.  Get off the phone.  Yeah, he's busy.  He can't make it.  What time?  Mind none of your business.  What time?  What time do you need to load your ear?  How's one?  Not good, cocksucker.  Fuck your teeth.  Close the office.  You heartless bitch.  Okay.  Yeah, what are you going to put?  Your tits on his teeth?  Yeah, he's fucking busy, lady.  Fuck that shit. 
[03:19:30]  You're overcharging him.  You're shitty tooth work.  File his teeth down with your vagina.  Okay.  Yeah, sure you will.  Knock off.  Thanks.  Knock off.  Could you hear that?  Of course.  Loud and clear.  Was that for you?  Yeah, that was the dental office.  They want to get you in early because of the snowstorm?  They want to get me in a little earlier because of the snow, but the funny thing is she knows 
[03:20:00]  all about the show and what it is and everything, so it was no shock or surprise.  She's like, oh boy, is that Jimmy?  Yes, that's Jim Norton.  They know the show.  That's why I didn't run out.  There have been times where you guys have started that shit and I've had to run out of the studio.  What was she supposed to do with her vagina?  I missed that part.  File down your teeth.  File down your teeth with it.  Just grind down your face with a badge. 
[03:20:30]  Okay.  That sounds good.  Can we do the questions Lady Di answered, Sam, before we wrap up for today?  The stuff that we've learned since the last time?  Yeah, no, just the second list.  The new ones, yeah.  And to keep it fair, she was on to the moon question, but besides that one, I don't think  she was on to any of the rest of them.  So what did she answer as legit questions?  Well, we learned a lot.  She doesn't live with Tom Hanks.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Anyway, she's called the show today fewer than 11 times. 
[03:21:00]  She is calling from the kitchen, not the roof.  So she's not on the roof.  Okay.  She's not.  She's not a professional tap dancer.  She was on the roof.  This place would look like the Federal Murrah Building in Oklahoma.  She's fat and came in.  Yes, it would.  She wasn't holding her lung in her hand.  No.  Okay.  No.  Her best friend is not a bunny rabbit.  Okay.  It's Marion. 
[03:21:30]  Marion is not a Somali pirate.  Although she should be tending the rabbits, that fucking fat Lenny idiot.  Lady Di is not the Queen of England.  No.  She never wrestled Bruno San Martino.  She did make a point of letting us know that.  She's not driving a bus to Florida today.  Okay.  Oh, I wish she was on the back of one with John Voight.  Get it?  She's dead.  Yes.  Get it.  Yes, we get it. 
[03:22:00]  And she doesn't buy Mavericks on the moon.  Oh.  But she was sort of on that.  Ratso Fatso.  Fatso Rizzo.  Fatso Rizzo.  Fatso Rizzo.  Don't call me Fatso in your apartment.  I'm here.  I'm Rico.  All right.  All right.  Well, we'll see you guys tomorrow then, I guess.  Indeed he do.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Thank you. </pre>
