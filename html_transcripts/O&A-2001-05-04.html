<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about *Survivor: The Australian Outback*, specifically Colby’s controversial final two decision and Tina’s emotional breakdown at the reunion show, including the shocking revelation of her marriage to her stepson.  Listener calls flooded the lines, filled with offensive language and criticisms of Colby's perceived disingenuousness.  The conversation then shifted to the “whipped cream bikini contest,” focusing on the photos published in *Star* magazine, featuring Kimmy, a *Survivor* contestant, and her subsequent phone call to the show detailing her post-show life in Los Angeles.  Studio guest Melissa, partially clothed and en route to a "Wow sticker stop," added to the show's already chaotic atmosphere.  Another guest, Gloria, later fulfilled her promise to walk a city block topless, with the event filmed and broadcast, prompting various street reactions.  The hosts engaged in numerous sexually explicit tangents, referencing strip clubs and other highly inappropriate topics throughout this segment.


The show transitioned to a largely outdoor broadcast, starting with the hosts being chased from a Hooters restaurant, creating a traffic jam. They then took a "victory lap" with Glorianne, who was topless, drawing catcalls from onlookers.  Comedian Kevin Meaney joined the show in-studio, along with Glorianne and Stacy, a woman who graphically detailed her severe lawnmower injury and subsequent surgeries, including showing her injured foot. This segment also featured listener calls, a discussion about an offensive word displayed on television during a Sting concert, Glorianne's upcoming appearances, Meaney’s family life (including jokes about his daughter), further discussion of the whipped cream bikini contest, and a listener complaint about Glorianne’s toplessness near children.  Promotional segments for Kawasaki motorcycles and Stacker 2 weight loss were interspersed throughout. A multimedia clip from Meaney’s website was shown.  The conversation frequently devolved into sexually suggestive comments and offensive language.


The in-studio portion with Kevin Meaney continued, delving into topics such as drug use (with anecdotes about Rodney Dangerfield), body hair removal techniques, and genital piercings. A naked woman was present in the studio for a significant portion of this segment, with the hosts frequently commenting on her. The whipped cream bikini contest remained a central theme, with discussions of various contestants (including Gloria Ann and "Club Foot"), and descriptions of the photographer's preferred poses.  Numerous listener calls further contributed to the show's sexually explicit and chaotic nature.  Advertisements for Sam Adams beer, the New Jersey Lottery, Woodbridge Power Sports, and AdultShop.com aired.  The segment concluded with a comedic Rocky Balboa and Adrian impersonation featuring the naked woman and continued discussions about the whipped cream bikini contest and plans for a promotional tour involving an RV and stickers.


A later segment featured Daisy, a participant in the whipped cream bikini contest, promoting her website, www.intimatenights.com/girls/daisy/htm. The focus shifted to Opie’s supposed ability to guess a woman's age from her genitalia, a “game” Daisy participated in, resulting in Opie correctly guessing her age.  The hosts and Daisy used vulgar language throughout, with the humor stemming from the sexually explicit nature of the age-guessing “game.” The segment concluded with the "FU Friday" segment, featuring obscene listener messages.

[00:05:30]  we really don't know what the hell is going to happen now all of a sudden our our our first party  uh person showed up and she has half a heel imagine tracking that through the woods you'd know it you'd  know it's her well i can't wait to see her i love how these shows develop though we're just kind of  talking also a lady with half a heel shows up in a little while kevin mean he's going to show up  okay a fine comedian uh gloria and supposedly stopping by that made everyone just lose their s does she  want to uh whip cream bikini oh yes she just happens to be in town and she wants in on the whipped cream 
[00:06:00]  bikini contest then we're gonna have other girls coming by to get in on the whipped cream bikini  contest yeah and it's good it's gonna go from there start sure the times square rap was boring  anyway so who cares uh john what's going on is it me yeah hey guys what's happening man hey um i've been  calling about survivor uh first of all colby dumbass yeah second of all the stoop go ahead go ahead no  go ahead uh finish what you want to say all right uh the reason why i'm calling if i don't know if 
[00:06:30]  anybody else noticed but the canister the container that the final votes were held in yeah if you  looked at the design at the very top of that yeah did it or did it not say wow it did i'll tell you  something obviously there was no uh wow on there they didn't intend to put a wow on but my eye was  drawn to it and you could kind of make out how the design looked like a w and then an o and then a w  yeah but it wasn't intentional well we have like three calls like this on the line that said no man 
[00:07:00]  it was wow written on the book it did look like looking at it what do you think of the uh final  episode i wasn't too thrilled with it it was all right i mean i think he screwed himself definitely  but he's the stupidest that's i have so many opinions about colby okay because everyone's like  oh no he was thinking with his heart and stuff no i think he's just a stupid dumb texan that  didn't understand completely understand you know the game and that you're there to win a million  dollars and he had the ideal situation he got the immunity and you know it was his call yeah because 
[00:07:30]  without a doubt if he brings keith to the finals the final two yeah there's no way keith's winning  no way and i was explaining the thing because ann was kind of like you were kind of like uh  you watch survivor every once in a while right very rarely yeah right but i mean  keith was not going to win this damn thing he pissed off too many people and i'll tell you why  he used to go to those tribal councils without packing because he knew he wasn't getting voted  off and that pissed people off so explain how he had the option to either get uh tina or uh keith on 
[00:08:00]  like how is it up to him uh because oh because uh their vote to cancel about each other yeah he won  the one immunity he won the final immunity and then they all have to vote for who's going to be kicked  off oh so he had uh the deciding vote yeah because obviously tina's not going to vote for herself and  keith's not going to vote for himself to be voted off so they they both vote for the other person  and then it's up to colby to basically decide who he wants to be in the final right he got to decide  who would be against him right for the for the uh yeah the last vote and he picked tina and he picked 
[00:08:30]  a girl that that was well liked i guess and uh or more liked than keith was oh without a doubt  then he's a complete out a doubt friggin idiot right why didn't he vote tina off and he's saying well  we made a pact and you know we want to be the final two and stuff but you know at that point  you backstab it break it you backstab it's a stupid uh game show yeah it's not real life or anything  you don't even know these people you've known them for 40 days and you probably made some uh pretty  strong bonds but you're still talking about a million bucks and it is a game show and then he's 
[00:09:00]  faking being happy when he lost yeah you know what thanks for bringing that up yeah oh i was like  and the final vote it's for tina and he stands up yeah yeah yeah awesome awesome yeah no one is that  excited after they lose a million dollars no that was so phony so fake and all the a lot of women at  home though just getting moist because oh he's such a good guy look how happy he is for tina  uh he's so sensitive oh billy so sensitive is this the clip the money clip um i want the reaction 
[00:09:30]  from colby yeah he stands up and starts screaming yeah i'm like wait a minute did he hear the thing  right right he lost he lost a million dollars idiot doesn't get me better than this three votes tina  three votes colby in true survivor tradition it comes down to one final vote 
[00:10:00]  the winner of survivor the australian outback  gino  yeah  yeah he's yelling like he won no you lost a million dollars you stupid dumb texan you lost 
[00:10:30]  nothing but don't fake it that was so fake yeah  oh he's trying to show that he's a good sport but you know he took him way too far tony what's up boys  yeah go ahead right go two quickies man one that whole you saw that boo-hoo sympathy crap coming out  i'm gonna buy my mommy out and help out my neighbors and set up a fun for fact kiss my ass  oh tina yeah yeah she was so predictable uh without a doubt he did obviously he's uh talking about the next survivor survivor three in africa 
[00:11:00]  africa dude i thought i was watching a goddamn soap opera is she gonna live with i uh we're gonna be we'll see you in the states i don't want to come here  how much did it suck for tina and colby they finally get all the votes in and all of a sudden jeff probes goes well you've waited so long but you're gonna have to wait a little longer and then all of a sudden he takes off in the helicopter  anthony i would have freaking taken out something and yeah anthony would have got up and chapped them out  yeah later guys all right i want to start throwing rocks or something here's tina what she was going to do with the money anthony 
[00:11:30]  this was so  oh it went right through me i'm like  you know when she's playing to you guys  yeah and the three things i'd like to do with the money the first three things is pay off my house  pay off my best friend's house and elizabeth gave me a fantastic idea about setting up a fund  putting money in that fund and the interest that it draws spend it one time a year for a family that 
[00:12:00]  in me and i thought that was one of the best ideas i've ever heard  might be all the coughing might be able to buy him a sandwich on the interest  after you pay for two houses yeah exactly and you put the rest in the bank with the interest yeah  well slow down after after uh uncle sam takes about uh yeah four hundred thousand then you pay off two  houses maybe get get some nice luxury gifts after that you're not going to be helping any families with  interest from the rest of the money oh look here's another box from tina oh mac and cheese mac and cheese 
[00:12:30]  another box of mac and cheese next year we get another box of mac and cheese  paul what's going on hey what's up guys hey listen did tina look like she had a little bit of work  done on her face or was it me no i know what that was paul that that's um chubby cheeks uh tina  looked like she ate a lot since uh the show ended four months ago a little makeup sure yeah but then i  mean then she's still wearing the uh belly shirt oh with the rolls of fat because i guess uh they told 
[00:13:00]  them all to you know try to wear the same outfit you were wearing at the final tribal council in the  outback so it's a good little seg between the uh old footage and the live footage that happened last  night yeah and one other thing is deb a wacko or is it oh my god oh my god that was seriously  emotional breakdown waiting to happen uncomfortable moment well what did deb say i mean they did the  town hall meeting and and uh brian gumbel obviously has to push the envelope says oh he didn't make her 
[00:13:30]  cry he goes no he didn't he just said deb you didn't want to be here right and she just sat there  like yeah you're right i didn't want to and then next you know all right right she's like you know  i'm not myself all right paul thanks we got the audio actually so let me play that right now  here's deb i i knew i didn't want to be a part of it  how come she's talking about uh being a part of the uh the whole reunion thing obviously  i i knew i didn't want to be a part of it how come 
[00:14:00]  well i guess nobody really got a chance to know me  and then i and then i got home and the press pretty much tore me apart  damn the press  no way  bad trade three days in the outside for your life being 
[00:14:30]  yeah exposed bad trade bad trade but  you can't look back i mean it's a done deal you just got to move forward it's just uh  i guess the hard part is i'm a strong very strong independent person and care about people a lot  and seems to have uh lost my belief in life  she was a whore  you know but i i will get it back 
[00:15:00]  god damn you already got it back girlfriend that's that's why we pay you the big bucks bryant  bring it on home oh god i hated when they broke into those applause after that you already got it  in fact  check her for her penis  she can't understand why the depressa crucified her after she got back from the outback 
[00:15:30]  yeah she married her stepson  i don't care what the circumstances are she ended up marrying her stepson  nice  didn't she married her stepson didn't you think going on survivor and having that little skeleton in  the closet that there there was going to be some problems yeah you got to be a little squeaky clean  how naive uh are you that you you think uh the press is going to leave you alone  the press after they find out that you married your stepson after uh your husband died 
[00:16:00]  so okay the husband dies  she's got a stepson then she married the stepson yeah holy mother of pearl yeah and she doesn't  understand why she was crucified this is america this is what the press does oh billy hey jim what's  up hey man yeah talking about dead last night i thought she was going to kill herself right on the  stage she just looked like she was losing it well she's miserable and i think you just see the hands 
[00:16:30]  start going on her shoulders from out of frame i was waiting for just one to grab her hooters  i got a little chuckle out of it but then all of a sudden she has the one hand two hands on her  yeah three well during when they just grabbed elizabeth for no apparent reason hey they're  touching her i'm gonna touch you when they were doing the voting thing what colby should have done  because what do you call tina kept reaching over and grabbing his hand yeah you should just lift your  hands up she just keeps reaching grab your junk let me tell you one thing there's something to be  said about anorexia oh yeah oh yeah you like it i like it little bulimia anorexia keeps the girls in 
[00:17:00]  shape never hurt anyone right well a lot of them gained some serious pounds after their time in the  outback you know you spent time out there they weren't uh they weren't eating open wasn't much  food available then when they got home they ate and what are you gonna hold it against them tommy  what's going on what's going on boys hey first of all go nick yes second of all oh god yes i didn't  want to think about that don't worry about it we'll be all right all right imagine if deb was  a guy and he married his stepdaughter after his wife died would he be getting applauded by the 
[00:17:30]  people in the crowd no thank you like you sick people still don't applaud uh woody allen exactly  exactly the point i made today woody allen they're not sure woody allen but they share this slob  you will pity for us you already did well you know i mean i felt for a little bit watching last night  but i'm like how stupid are you of course they were going to crucify you when you came back i don't feel for  her at all not at all uh i i i do because i uh and i know what new hampshire's all about they're a  little they're a little naive up there yeah that's true that's true have a good weekend boys all right 
[00:18:00]  go nicks all right yeah this has to be brought out too because i thought this as well danny what's up  what's up all right i'll get this all on here holy mo danny go ahead no did you guys notice that colby's  probably having sex with his mother i thought last week's episode he said two key things that make me  think that one that his mother's visit to him in the outback was like a conjugal visit yeah he said  that yeah he said that a conjugal visit does he know what that means yeah that's when you get your 
[00:18:30]  f on in the joint he's no because he's a stupid dumb texan that a lot of people uh whatever  people are buying it thinking this guy is all that as they would say on ricky lake middle america  what else what else the other thing he said with my hug that she didn't respond to him orally  didn't respond to him orally meaning like someone's got to find a clip of that last week's episode  you put those two things together my visit was like a visit but she didn't respond orally 
[00:19:00]  that's something yes that's pretty cool all right man thank you thanks bye later let's uh go to tim tim  what's going on hey guys how you doing all right yeah i don't think colby was really upset because  think about it he's one that everybody loves he's gonna get all the endorsements you guys you didn't  but you know when you're playing the game you don't know that you don't know that that's a guarantee  he just was stupid but yeah that's why he was live last night remember he's had the past two months  of everybody loving him being in the paper and everything you know yeah you gotta think about that 
[00:19:30]  that's why he was really uh i mean but did you see how much he changed from when the first travel  council the second oh my god yeah yeah i don't know you mean from uh the tape to the the live  shot last night well they all look a little different like an aids victim oh they can't fda  in the last time i'm telling you there's something to be said about that anorexia makes them all look uh  nice you you brought up something good because it's funny they tried to pull it off like all right  i i think they knew people weren't going to think that it was the same day but they tried to make it 
[00:20:00]  look like it with the tribal council and uh the clothing being the same and obie brought up a good  point in the office he said it's it's sort of like when um gilligan's island you're watching  the tv series and then they brought them all back for the um the first movie like escape from gilligan's  island the rescue rescue from gilligan's island yeah and they kind of looked the same only a little  off yeah the sets were sets looked the same but just a little different the clothing you know it sure  as hell wasn't the same gilligan clothes it was the same color the same shape it was supposed to be the 
[00:20:30]  same one but just a little off and you're like wait they aged a little bit and i'm not even sure  if that's the real ginger anymore is it i couldn't tell so when they're gaining a little weight and uh  a little time goes by they have some makeup on their hair's done it's the same people but they  just look a little off right all right you guys are so observant you're picking up on everything i did  jay i saw this go ahead jay all right three things one cal rubbing the uh lesbian shoulder with his uh 
[00:21:00]  whacking hands i thought that was disgusting all right here's another one well i didn't see that  i don't know what is junk hanging out of his pants his yam bag was just you're right man he looked  like an elephant down his face you're right colby's yam bag just a big freaking piece of melted taffy just  to the side i didn't notice that and uh call me when you have to but i'm like what is going on in that  guy's uh brian gumbel's quivering chin and he looked like he was going to cry when deb broke down 
[00:21:30]  that's the one i know is brian gumbel what happened to him it's the sensitive brian now he gets teary  eyes and his chin was going like this it was guys i gotta run i'll talk to you all right let's uh let's  go to dave dave what's going on all right what's happening hey man you know two observations one as soon  as they were done with the balloting and he's like it's going to be sealed in a container there  was no so because it was the same container that he came on the show with and he left on the helicopter 
[00:22:00]  i said to my fiancee he's going to be arriving at the studio in the same helicopter right we're in  this it's like you know he flew all the way overseas right from australia in a helicopter there  ain't a helicopter i can make it but that's how they made it see it was so obvious i know that's  i think that's what's going to end up uh wrecking survivor when they start polishing it up and start  building studios and and you know what i mean the first survivor was so raw and you know you got such 
[00:22:30]  a great reaction when when rich won it all right there and then and if you don't think because  that because all that emotions build it up on you you're at the final tribal council you've been  through hell and back you know you need to know at that moment not after you've been back in the united  states and now they're talking about having a celebrity survivor yeah whatever they'll like water that  down to the point it'll be unwatchable and if did you watch letterman last night yeah letterman has  no clue about this show like he had this uh survivor quiz yeah and the best question on there was they 
[00:23:00]  had jerry like looking at something on her wrist yeah a was a she's fixing her bracelet b she's looking  at her watch or c she's looking to see when her 15 minutes are famous right that was classic yeah you  you gotta know what they did they took those votes and they stacked them up so it would be exciting  a tie with one vote as the tiebreaker you know they did that don't think it was just luck that they  pulled those goddamn votes out and it just happened that the last vote was the tiebreaker right please 
[00:23:30]  that's what i was going to bring up earlier they're saying in true survivor suspense oh crap and  there's no suspense let's give her a two nothing lead then colby comes rushing by with three then  let's tie it up and oh it's like wwf yeah it was stacked it was like they knew it it's like hulk hogan  like coming back after he's been down for two counts well not it not that exciting hey that's a great  reference right there hogan reference hulk the hulkster very good it's so 1988 it's like uh rambo i'd say 
[00:24:00]  going in and uh blowing exactly i thought he was down in the little river but it's like  the beaver hey mike what's going on what's going on how you doing good all right listen not to go  back on the whole subject but copie he thought he won he thought he won when he went he wasn't rooting  for tina he thought he won because he got mixed up with that voting was all about it yeah because uh  usually they vote for the person they want the outback whatever so you might be onto something he  might have got confused and go away if they're holding up tina that means she's voted out and i'm the winner 
[00:24:30]  right his reaction was just not normal and it was immediate it was like the second it came out he  jumped up whoo yeah like no you you'd have to sit there and go like oh god all right hey congratulations  and then get excited for it right exactly the reaction time was totally off totally off and  that guy's a jerk all right thank you a couple more and we'll move on here gavin what's up how you  doing oh and i good all right just a couple of quick observations first hey you leave our kimmy alone 
[00:25:00]  she got i know she got she got some uh national exposure we'll get into that in a minute here but  go ahead sure sure what else you got gavin well i thought no colby gets the uh dumb ass of the year  of course right and um no that is my backyard back home they really should have put a hilton above the  camp that's for damn sure yeah but uh there's a lot of more hospitable places in that country than  where they were put so but they did well for what they did okay and rocky yeah keep going 
[00:25:30]  go ahead gavin all right no problem and the when they chase that pig situation the biggest carrier  of tuberculosis in australia is by feral pigs oh yeah just a little tidbit for the information there  you go pb all right thank you gavin no problem guys all right hopey gavin was actually russell crow  going into the show thank you he loved his appearance on our show and figured uh he'd you  know call back all back uh paul what's up hey what's up boy hey i think the uh well i heard that the 
[00:26:00]  winner of the next uh survivor in kenya is the one who gets out of africa without getting aids getting  the aids is that it yeah we know africa is a total aids hotbed that might be it you know can you see like  half of them all getting ebola you know what they come back for the final tribal council and they're all just  some of them are dead no one's got the big sarcoma on them they got liquid coming out of the eyes  puking up blood you know i wouldn't put i wouldn't put it past mark burnett he's a sick ass yeah these

[01:24:00]  maybe if i had a midget for a daughter or son i probably would have gone with uh mini me you know  meanie me can we get the girl in with the uh the heel would you like to uh uh meet the girl well  you've met her i wanted to be a podiatrist really get the kid so uh her foot was really interesting to  me all right bring in the foot girl and uh let's see what her story is all about the rest of her is  uh quite lovely oh she's very nice i remember when i wanted to was a kid i was always looking into  podiatry as a as a field to go really i was and you know my father would be taking a nap i'd be 
[01:24:30]  feeling his feet you know and my mother what are you doing that i want to go into the diet tree that's  thick touching people's feet dirty old feet i had dreams you know when i was a kid  you know hi there how are you how's your foot fine thank you what's your name again my name is stacy  stacy stacy she told me her name outside the studio but i was a little distracted by the the foot 
[01:25:00]  stacy the lump the lump you like it don't you it's interesting did anthony check it out yet i've yet to  see the foot here walk over walk over and put the foot up on the console you have a little walking  problem no no you walk fine i bet you dance really well she walks real nice she's got a nice body  why did they why do they have to pack so much on yeah lift it up lift it up on the counter  why don't you wear a sock oh socks you know no no it's fine no it's just a weird looking foot wow 
[01:25:30]  now god holy mother of god what kind of skin is that on there that's skin from my thighs skin  from your side from where on your side bumps on it let me see whoa wait where's they took a patchwork  quilt oh my god what well let me let me see oh this is really medical though they even though she's  stripping anthony's looking at her thigh where they've taken skin like like as if it was uh with 
[01:26:00]  they uh what do they call those things like you know when you take cheese off of the the cheddar  cheese for the crackers you use that little implement right yeah it's not really a grater  it's a slicer thing it looks like they took that took some skin and used that for your foot it looks  like they took a lot more skin than they put on your foot i had to have the surgery twice you had to  have it twice oh the skin didn't take the first time no i got in a car accident and i messed up the  surgery oh my god you get your foot stuck in a lawnmower it hacks a piece of your heel off they 
[01:26:30]  fix it with some skin on your thigh then you wreck it in a car wreck and have to get it again what is  wrong with you why do you do this to your father and i driving around with your bad foot you're like a  crazy person she wants your brothers aren't losing their feet now what was the alternative to having  them take uh pieces of your thigh much better story you have to um they sew your legs together for like 
[01:27:00]  two years and the skin and the bone regenerates hold it yeah so they take your other foot they sew it  together to your bad foot right and somehow it magically fixes the other foot yes the skin bonds  to each other bonds and then they cut you it apart after two years yeah how do you get around you hop  i have no idea we didn't take that method but what if you would have just said screw it leave it alone  just let it heal like it is uh they would cut it off then oh so this was amputation or yeah we went

[01:53:00]  plugged in thank you so you have uh your right testicle or left testicle oh i have the left you  have the left right what happens i hang to the right most of the time yeah is this gonna be a fun story or  depressing well maybe it happened in a fun way i don't know well no having it strangulated by its  own muscle isn't really fun per se especially when you're 13. when you didn't know and so you felt  dirty also right the muscle it was strangled by was between the thumb and forefinger you ought to 
[01:53:30]  gotta have backed off a little bit there pal oh you must i thought it might correct it but i didn't  you must have felt so dirty no yeah i couldn't walk upright for a while your testi was strangled  well your testicles are actually attached to your diaphragm oh right i extend muscle it's like a  ligament that's why it hurts so much somebody i i went to school with uh actually had something like  that it was called a twisted yo-yo i believe yes and uh it swelled up and cut off the blood supply and 
[01:54:00]  he went to the hospital and had it taken care of but i waited i was first misdiagnosed so i ended up  waiting two weeks you felt dirty right so how much did you get from the hospital from inside nothing  no actually he died my doctor died of a heart attack a week later did you just laugh your ass  off at his death no no not really did the things swell up i mean yeah about the about the size of a  racquetball oh and basically you couldn't i couldn't stand up straight because if he did that it would  pull back hey hey hey hey hey here's a great image for you imagine someone put the vice grip 
[01:54:30]  on one testicle mildly tight and then slowly tighten to screw a little bit every day for 14 days  hey we saw a video like that once explain that video to kevin meaning one of our favorite videos  of all time it was some uh like uh twisted porno thing not some woman no it was not not  buster but it could have been called that buster makes me feel good this uh guy is on the couch he's 
[01:55:00]  naked there's a girl next to him naked you only see his lap she she's playing uh fiddling about let's  say she grabs what we will now refer to as the yam bag uh-huh right and starts um manipulating him a  little bit and then squeezes pretty hard yeah then she's twisting it a little bit like it's a doorknob  she then twists it completely around and doesn't stop there once twice three times 
[01:55:30]  then she picks him up as far as she can by twisted yam bag and you're like this guy isn't even flinching  yeah they slowly pan the camera back he's dead right he is dead as a doorknob obviously they had some  fun at the funeral home that night and uh videotaped it yeah notice i didn't flinch at once oh no well  the guy was he was lucky he was dead yeah so get back to it so it was swollen and then they had to 
[01:56:00]  remove it and it was swollen so i waited about two weeks so i would go down go back up go back down and  then one day i couldn't take the pain anymore went to the hospital and doctors like get him in the or  right now uh no but i switch off now just to be safe  did they put in any kind of uh i was offered various shapes and sizes i was told that quote  you were offered a fake one yeah but i would rather get a transplant from another person so i  get a 50 50 chance of having like a different race child that's impossible it'd be great if it wasn't 
[01:56:30]  could you have a uh testicle transplant i don't know there is no testicle transplant  well i'm sure there's like some prisoners may would want to sell their testicles yeah that's  going to be in his next newsletter testicle transplant testicle transplant here's my paragraph  on testicles well let me tell you one thing uh i will uh i this show will be in my newsletter  i want you to be aware of that i will be checking back yeah and we'll make sure all are listed but  did they offer you a little silicone thing that was offered why didn't you go for just aesthetics 
[01:57:00]  i didn't at that time in my life i wasn't even thinking about it you know i gotta ask the  question did you take showers in the gym with the other kids no and what about your first sexual  experience oh nothing nothing out of the ordinary she didn't reach down and go hey um you're a little  short no i announced it ahead of time oh you did yeah i forgot me on our first date well that gets  the it gets the shock out of the way you never know what to say and you said well wait till you see my foot

[02:06:30]  and uh you know we're talking about rodney beans and you got a towel around you but i'm sure you're  thinking of dirty thoughts and and jesus you know and you're well i think she's lovely how do you feel  about jesus christ our lord savior i never really paid attention honestly but you went to why you go to  the catholic college because it's a good school because it's a good school it's expensive but it's  good yeah how are you going to raise your children catholic um i don't know you don't know i'm not 
[02:07:00]  going to have kids oh you're not a dog a dog dog okay that's good why not all right thank you  all right well why don't why don't she uh get her little whipped cream bikini on uh and i noticed by  her um the hairstyle coincidentally enough because we use this term a lot by the hairstyle not the  hair on our head we call it the john bonnet it's the clean sweep the wood floor yes also known on this  show as the john bonnet ramsey i don't think kevin understands what you're talking about so maybe you 
[02:07:30]  want to see the show the john bonnet ramsey cut to kevin meaning because he's a little confused right  yeah but it's the jump oh we call that oh my god we call that the john bonnet ramsey that is dirty  that is wrong isn't that horrible why not kevin is going to have an infection  don't you know why the hair is there 
[02:08:00]  the hair you're going to let me tell you have you talked about have you uh read about rosie's  all that stuff uh that's that hair keeps out a lot of germs i think that's how rosie got it on her  hand you know oh that's not right that's not right so but kevin that's very very uh fashionable these  days very popular with the young girl yeah it's just to sweep it clean clean get it out of there 
[02:08:30]  oh who needs the hair what are we cavemen you know you just get rid of it it's there for a reason  for what reason maybe back in caveman days when they're walking through thickets and you don't  want something getting in that area it's you check it yeah let me ask you let me let me tell you this  sure yeah i bet she goes to her doctor and says hey doc i'm shaving my area do you think that's a  good idea i bet the doctor is going to say and i bet it's a woman or a man the doctor is going to say  it's not a good idea to shave it do you think so i bet the doctor will 
[02:09:00]  and every doctor never said a thing of course they're embarrassed what do you shave in that area  for it's sexy it's not sexy it's sassy how could that be sexy it's sassy it's nice when you trim it  oh you like the trim thing but you don't like the clean sweep not the clean sweep no we call the  other i noticed the clean sweep before you oh you do i know i know you did i just wanted to explain  what we call the john bonnet thing i all of a sudden little thrown sick we actually play a game 
[02:09:30]  on this uh show called uh guess what's in my pants it's a phone game girl calls in yeah she takes her  phone and rubs it on her most intimate of areas we have to guess by the sound what her hairstyle is  right it's usually the uh we go with the triangle uh-huh or if it's a lot of hair it's called the uh  pool rack full of afro hair kind of just looks like a a pool rack full of and then there's uh the  regular triangle then there's what we call the mohawk which is the straight landing strip and  then the one that the mohawk shaved down from the belly button toward the intimates is called the 
[02:10:00]  hitler mustache and then the ever popular with the young catholic college girls the john bonnet ramsey  or the wood floor anthony i'm getting the feeling we're sharing a little too much with kevin meanie  today i think he's liking this i do like it yeah i'm just you know because i'm fascinated with uh  stuff how we uh we take care of ourselves but when you got it you know what it is i i don't think  you've been exposed to a lot of the young naked college jobs lately and i've never been in college  no but these days they shave it like that everybody is shaving their areas back i think i think 
[02:10:30]  i mean yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna call my uh niece up no that's not a good idea you know what  it is though kevin back in the days maybe when when we or when you or i would have gone to college  uh a lot of the girls were sporting what i like to call um fidel castro eating a london broil  you know what i mean kind of big and it was fashionable in the 70s uh-huh like uh throwing  a piece of hubba bubba on the barbershop floor wow just a lot of hair now it's very fashionable 
[02:11:00]  to just scrape it off scrape it off a clean sweep well she's uh feeling a little weird so why don't  you get your whipped cream bikini on yeah i think you're lovely and i think uh you got a really good  chance of uh going to hawaii where i come from only kids your age grow beards remember that from  planet of the age somehow it makes you look less intelligent all right oh well go to your touch  down there now you'll get it you'll have a belly ring too which is not really a good idea a belly

[02:20:30]  Jennifer, you're next on WNEW.  Okay, come on.  As you guys know, Kevin Meany was right.  You have to go with the Hitler mustache.  You can't be JonBenet.  Why?  Why?  You can get infections with all kinds of lovely stuff.  The hair definitely does serve a purpose.  Oh, no.  It kind of helps with friction.  I think we all could relate to, you know, having a falling on the gym floor with your belly exposed. 
[02:21:00]  And it just kind of goes, right?  It just goes, you just get a squeak and a little puff of smoke.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Jennifer, for that advice.  All right.  Bye.  Liz is in a cab somewhere in New York City.  Liz, what's up?  Hi.  I want to tell you I'm in a cab, and I am on my way to the studio for the Wittgenheim Bikini contest.  Oh, this is it.  The last hour.  Right now.  I'm cutting it down to the wire.  I was a little nervous.  I had to go out and get a couple drinks first.  No, that's cool. 
[02:21:30]  But I just want to be on my way.  All right.  Get here before 7.  I'm in a cab.  I'm on my way.  All right, Liz.  We'll see you when you get here.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We are in the last hour of qualifying.  Here it is, girls.  You want your chance to maybe go to Hawaii.  Right.  If you're voted the best whipped cream bikini.  And the winning, the winning, the voting starts Monday.  Mm-hmm.  We'll have all the finalists up for everyone to vote for.  Very exciting.  Very exciting time around this studio when we pick the finalists.  Everyone gets together. 
[02:22:00]  It's not just me.  It's not just Opie, Ben.  I mean, everyone gets together.  It's going to be tough to narrow this down to like 10 or 12 finalists.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  By the way, the pictures of Gloria Ann.  Oh, we haven't plugged Gloria Ann lately.  I promised that we'd plug Gloria Ann.  Gloria Ann will be dancing at New York Dolls tonight and Saturday.  Where's New York Dolls?  Wall Street District.  Look at this picture.  Does that just say like a thousand words?  It's just amazing. 
[02:22:30]  It's her walking down the street.  We had Gloria Ann who has 38 double Ds.  They're natural, we found out this time around.  She was in our best boob contest and the people just freaked.  Oh, my God.  Club foot is naked.  Hey, funny foot girl.  What happened?  What happened there?  You decided to do it.  They got me naked.  Bravo.  I'm naked.  You have decided to do it.  Bravo.  You know, I've seen you naked.  I completely forgot about your bad foot.  Not bad, huh?  That's very nice.  Look at you.  Very nice. 
[02:23:00]  You're a lucky man.  Thumbs up.  One testy guy.  Wow.  Misery loves company.  Wow.  Are you playing with her getting naked like this out of nowhere?  He encouraged it.  Really?  Yeah.  Good job.  Wow.  It was his idea.  Wow.  I don't even know what we're talking about.  The door opens and the girl who comes in naked.  The bad foot comes in naked.  It looks like all the other parts are doing just fine.  So Rick posed you and everything and did a good job.  Good.  You're happy with the pics?  I don't know. 
[02:23:30]  I haven't seen them yet.  He didn't make you do the dumb pose, did he?  What?  The Jesus pose?  No.  Well, he...  No.  The Jesus pose is one of his latest.  Rick has some specialties.  You know, now that he's a photographer that is...  I'm published.  It's being published in National Magazine now.  Star Magazine has a shot that Rick took of, of course, Kimmy from Survivor.  Yeah.  We were talking about this earlier.  Page 57 of the latest Star Magazine.  The May 15th issue.  Huge picture.  And this is Rick's work.  Yes, Rick's work.  Very nice. 
[02:24:00]  As now one of the paparazzi.  Right.  Kimmy in her whipped cream bikini with Jeff from Survivor.  And it says real fast, Anthony.  Yeah.  Survivor 2's vegetarian stripper Kimmy wouldn't eat meat on the CBS reality show,  but she had no problem wearing a whipped cream bikini during a wild radio show.  We're a wild radio show.  Wow.  Kinky Kimmy bare it all and got creamed during the Opie and Anthony show on WNW 1027 in New York.  We're going to add a plug, finally.  As part of a raunchy swimsuit competition, Kimmy decided to take part.  But when she entered the studio, accompanied by fellow Survivor contestant Jeff Varner, 
[02:24:30]  a staffer with a super soaker water gun blasted away her creamy cover-up.  There it is.  The latest Star Magazine.  Huge picture that Rick took.  May 15th issue, page 57.  All right.  I'll be trying copies of that photo when you come by the studio.  So I guess what I was trying to say, Rick didn't make you do the dump pose.  Like where you're squatting down looking like you're ready to take a dump.  No.  Rick's going for something.  I can't question him anymore because of all the publicity his shots are getting. 
[02:25:00]  I don't understand myself, the whole, like, you know, putting the girls in the dump position.  Taking the dump thing.  I don't like it.  His very popular pose now, Opie.  Here's an example.  This was the girl from yesterday.  What was her name again?  Is that Emma Lisa or something like that?  Yeah.  Who's a really hot, hot girl.  She's in the dump pose.  Dump pose.  But he's trying to make the Jesus thing his now.  Right.  He's like, all right, do the Jesus pose now. 
[02:25:30]  The Jesus pose is going to be like, oh, that is a Rick specialty.  That everyone's going to know.  That and the frisk pose.  The frisk.  Yeah.  Hands up against the wall.  That's a Rick original, too.  Very good.  Maybe Penthouse will hire you in one of these things.  I invented those.  All right.  Hey, guys, thank you.  That was a nice surprise.  Thank you.  Me.  Thanks.  There goes the lovely couple.  Bravo.  He has one testy.  She has one foot, basically.  And Kristen's leaving.  We already did her shots. 
[02:26:00]  Hey, Kristen.  Very nice.  Thank you.  I saw your photo shoot.  I think you're going to do well.  Good job.  Well in this contest.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Very good.  You were happy with Rick's photography?  Yeah.  With his poses?  Not that.  Did he make you do the dump pose?  No.  Where you're squatting like you're taking a dump?  No.  For some reason.  Rick stayed away from the dump pose today.  She's a Catholic girl, so I had to get the Jesus pose, right?  Yeah.  Ah, the Jesus pose.  And her pictures will be up on www.com very soon.  Yeah.  Right?  I just have to say one thing.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  I have to say hello to Local 72, 79.  Local 79.  Okay.  I don't know who they are, but...  I was told to do it.  And to...  What is it?  Precinct 102.  All right.  Well, we know what they do.  We know what they do.  Yeah, we know what they do.  And we support that.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Cool.  And Anthony, I think what we were trying to say before this went horribly wrong, the  pictures of Glorianne, who will be at New York Dolls Friday and Saturday, tonight  and tomorrow, are up on www.com in the whipped cream bikini section. 
[02:27:00]  And these pictures of her walking around the block are just insane.  Yeah, everyone's talking about it.  The pictures of her in the elevator are just insane.  Oh, yeah.  There's pictures of her in the elevator.  It's insane.  Oh, thank you, Sean, from Staten Island.  Opie, New York Dolls is on Mary Street between West Broadway and Church Street by the Twin Towers.  Looks like this guy's been there just a couple times.  And Glorianne will also be at Village Comics tomorrow afternoon from noon to two, signing  stuff.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:27:30]  Okay?  Yes.  That was a lot to get out.  I think we have to take another break because we were kind of running late with Kevin.  Yeah.  Kevin was fun.  He was a lot of fun.  Definitely.  All right.  You want to talk about the teacher and all the other stuff going on around the city?  Yeah, I guess there's other stuff going on.  Today?  Sure.  Okay.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussy.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:28:00]  1027 WNEW is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.  The fire leaves everyone asking questions.  Ron, your cigar's almost burnt down the building.  Fez, it wasn't my cigar.  How can you be sure?  Because I put my cigar out.  It was right before I let those co-cores use our offices to freebitch. 
[02:28:30]  I told them to lock up, and then I left.  And there must be another explanation for the fire.  But what?  All on the next, Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Mid-day, noon to 3.  1027 WNEW.  So many people checking out Gloria Ann's pictures as she walks around the black tops with her.  Yeah.  One guy goes, hey, guys, I'm checking out the pictures of Gloria Ann, and I didn't realize that Rick was a midget.  I'm going to explain, but that's funny. 
[02:29:00]  This guy's dead serious, too.  He's like, I didn't know Rick was a midget.  But the problem is that Gloria Ann has, like, 8-inch heels on, and she's got to be, like, 6'3", in these pictures.  Which picture?  There's a picture of you.  I saw it.  And you're next to Gloria Ann, and you're a hell of a lot shorter than her.  Dude, she's a big girl, and she's wearing huge heels.  She's got to be, like, 5'9", regularly.  And then she's got, it looks like, 6- to 7-inch heels on.  Hmm.  And then she put her boob in the scale that the guy was selling fruit out of. 
[02:29:30]  That's lovely.  Anthony.  Yes.  We are talking about Woodbridge Power Sports.  You found the picture?  Turn it around.  Because I've got to laugh again.  That's a really freaking show.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I'm on the phone here with, uh, Gloria Ann.  What are you, Anthony?  I'm on the phone.  No, I was, like, weaning on the railing, too, so that didn't help.  I've got to hold the phone in my ear with these little midget arms.  I'm going to waddle down the street with a girl for a little longer, and then I'll be back up. 
[02:30:00]  Yo, yo.  Now, that's funny.  That's funny.  She's taller.  I understand.  Okay.  Woodbridge Power Sports.  Hey.  Right.  Oh, we know these guys.  They've got that huge warehouse, right?  Huge.  Where they ride bikes indoors.  There's 33,000 square feet.  And they don't want the boss to know that they're trying out the bikes indoors. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  That rocks.  You're going to see a lot of bikes.  The warehouse outlet of Woodbridge Power Sports in Linden, New Jersey.  Over $2 million worth of inventory to choose from.

[02:31:30]  Greg from Chicago, listening to the show, Syndication Underground.  Nice.  Thinks he saw Rick on HBO the other night, after the Sopranos.  It's a warm show.  It's a warm show.  Toby, Anthony, I'm here with this lovely, lovely girl.  This is wonderful.  Yo, yo, yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.

[02:32:30]  Marijuana, isn't it?  So, honey, medically and legally, it never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Don't make up your mind, Joe Friday.  What is it?  I love it.  Hot.  Grass.  Mary Jane.  1027 WNAW.  Brian has something to say.  Brian, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  How's it going?  Yeah.  Great.  I'm on my way back from college right now.  I just called in so I could hear the show. 
[02:33:00]  Uh, yeah.  What, you're on hold because you can't get us in the car?  Yeah, well, I'm all the way down in Virginia right now and I hit the show on Monday.  I just wanted to make sure you guys were doing a little bit better than, uh...  I thought people had totally forgotten about Monday by today.  Well, I just wanted to remind them a little bit.  All right, Brian, I'm going to put you back on hold.  All right.  This is what I need to say.  Yeah.  Don't ever lose faith in your pals, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  We had one of the worst shows we've ever done this past Monday for some reason.  We don't even know why.  It was the day a balloon guy came in.  You can't even blame him.  Oh, I'm not blaming him.  I'm just giving it as a reminder of what show it was.  The stars were aligned the wrong way.  Something was going on.  And we'll openly admit, one of the worst shows Anthony and I have done together.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Couldn't get anything going.  Since then, we went right back.  Had a great week.  It was worth a show.  That's why you can never lose faith in us. 
[02:34:00]  Never.  Absolutely.  Just think of all the stuff that happened after Monday's disaster.  Yeah.  I almost forgot about Monday.  I did forget about Monday until Brian just mentioned it.  Thanks, dick.  All right.  Let's go to Sal.  Stalker Patty's here, by the way.  Sal.  Wonderful.  Sal.  What's up?  Hurry up, man.  What's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  I'm blazed up, and you guys are making me laugh harder and harder every second.  He's blazed up.  Blazed up.  He's blazed up.  What else is he going to do?  I'm the junk. 
[02:34:30]  All right, Sal.  I'm the job, too.  All right, Sal.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Another hot girl walking down the...  Wait.  I think he knows her.  I think he just gave her a really big hug.  Oh, yeah?  Who's that?  Patty's naked out there.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, my God.  I don't even think I got...  Hold on.  I might have it right here.  Someone...  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Someone's just wearing a black dress to cover up. 
[02:35:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  You know, we just got an instant feedback from a guy that just said,  You guys have the greatest jobs in the world.  Thank you.  Because of the whole Gloriane thing and all the hotness we've seen.  But see, this is the other side of the...  Hello.  Thank you.  What are you talking about?  This is what balances the whole thing out.  And this is the hell that Anthony and I have to live with every day.  We had Gloriane, one of the hottest strippers I've ever seen, 
[02:35:30]  with 38DD Natural Breast, which, by the way, she'll be at New York College tonight and Saturday.  Who cares about Gloriane?  I've got a snap and coos that'll make your head spin.  And I was hoping that would be the last image I see today, Anthony,  as we, you know, go home for the weekend.  Oh, no.  It's going to be patty naked.  You want a T-F-ing?  Gee, I'm glad I'm so ugly.  Hey, I didn't even say that. 
[02:36:00]  I didn't say it.  Because of what that website said about me that I found in that photo of myself.  The one of you on the train tracks with your head cut off?  Yeah.  The one I did that scared me at a seven years growth.  I didn't even expect it to be popped up.  I get scared a couple more times then.  Ann, I'm dry heaving.  Are you?  Yeah, my mouth is watering.  Who wants to munch me?  Ugh.  I shaved myself to look more sexy, but I got prickly heaps. 
[02:36:30]  So I rubbed some witch hazel on my greasy meat flaps.  And see what I take.  I'm such a good sport.  You are.  Thank you.  What?  Never mind.  It doesn't make you a good sport.  If you were a good sport, you wouldn't be here.  What?  Stop it.  Stop it.  Opie, what are we going to do about this? 
[02:37:00]  Do we have to do this?  Huh?  She wants a reshoot.  Who are we to say no?  Patty, what's going to make these pictures better?  I don't know.  Patty, now that you're here, Opie doesn't believe that you don't have a, he thinks you have a hairy balloon nut.  Remember that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Take my word for it.  I just...  She'll open your balloon.  No!  It was open.  I've already looked when I went to the vehicle and made it to find it. 
[02:37:30]  I swear to God, my mouth watered like, like, just before you start puking.  Stop.  Of course, you're hungry.  Natalie and Dana, do not lie.  They already confirmed it.  Confirmed.  Okay.  Okay, Patty.  All right, go out and take some pictures.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Let me see.  Shake that ass.  Surprisingly, you'll be the only one out there.  Look, she's got the, uh... 
[02:38:00]  Hey, Patty, I can see your ass right from the back of the apron.  Right?  Well, because it doesn't go all the way around.  That's your work apron?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah?  Oh, God, I was carrying it.  Ah, from Mickey D.  Hey, Patty, go outside to get your pictures taken,  and hopefully the people that work in this building will do us a favor  and take the shots with the surveillance camera.  Thank you.  Oh, Patty.  Look, you're upsetting Patty.  Actually, we're going to take you to a bank. 
[02:38:30]  They have a camera there we can use.  Okay.  Rick, you've got to get out there and pose us.  Yeah, Rick, what's taking so long?  You usually jump right off that chair.  Yeah.  I'm not really that bad.  Nope, a lot of people have been calling up and complimenting you, Patty.  Well, Patty, why don't you drop the towel, and we'll, um...  No.  No, I know.  It's very embarrassing for all of us.  I understand.  I did drop the towel. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, my God.  One second.  One second.  One second.  I wanted to take your shorts off.  You shaved there, Patty?  I only do it for physical comfort.  Like, wear clothes.  Wow.  You never shaved before listening to our show.  Yeah.  When did you start shaving?  Be honest.  A few years ago.  Yeah, maybe three years ago, right, or so?  No.  When I started on the ONA show. 
[02:39:30]  No.  Longer than that.  I wanted to shave more often, but my razors kept running away.  Hey, Patty, drop your towel and show New York's finest what you're sporting.  There you go.  He's a cop.  He's a cop.  He's seen crime scenes.  Don't worry about it.  He's fished bodies out of the Hudson.  Yeah, why is he pulling out that yellow tape?  He's making a chalk outline. 
[02:40:00]  What's that about?  This is what we call a visual felony.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  It's not really that thick.  Yeah, Ross, Patty.  All right, Patty, you can put the towel back on.  She's got it back on.  I didn't know.  We'll be just jealous, Patty, because he ain't getting what you're packing right there. 
[02:40:30]  Well, there's a girl on the line that wants to give you some encouragement.  All right.  Elisa.  It's Lisa.  Lisa.  Actually, I saw Patty's pictures.  She wasn't bad.  And I just wanted to tell her she had very nice legs.  She needs to pose and emphasize them.  Hey, Lisa.  Your legs.  So you saw Patty's pictures and they're not that bad, huh?  No.  Well, I saw the way you guys have described her.  I thought she was a lot worse.  I want to give you a number.  1-800-984-2020 for Dr. Philotov.  Dr. Philotov. 
[02:41:00]  He'll fix those eyes up on you.  Yes.  All right, Lisa.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why don't you get the surgery, Patty, so you don't have to wear those specs anymore?  I don't have the money.  Oh.  You'll look like the new version of Talia Shire.  But I am going to take my glasses off.  What a picture, though.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, you know, we go to the zoo or something.  I am going to.  I like the tigers, Amy.  You like the tigers?  I'm thinking, you know, maybe we already get married or something. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, Rocky, stop it.  I am going to take my glasses off, though.  Rocky, I love the way you're trained by punching the meat.  Now punch this meat.  There you go.  We got to get Patty into a pet shop.  You look like Apollo Creed after Club Alive got through it.  Well, you kind of look like Talia Shire a little bit.  You can't do it, Rock. 
[02:42:00]  Just a few lines.  Oh, Pauly, shut up.  I love him.  Talia Shire.  He's going to kill you, Rocky.  Why are you having faith in me, Amy?  Why are you having faith in me?  I don't know.  Did you see that one?  Rocky 6. 
[02:42:30]  What the hell happened to you, Amy?  I'm working back at the pet shop.  You know, there's two really hot girls outside the studio.  Do we have to, like...  We got Patty.  Well, can we line them all up?  Soft.  We need to get the bad taste of tequila out of our mouths.  You mean the worm.  Are those girls here for the whipping bikini contest?  Rocky, I shaved my lap like Clubber Lang's head. 
[02:43:00]  It's a mohawk.  I used the jewelry.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Want to come back to my place?  I'll show you a real man.  Okay.  I'll take the big black fist.  That's right.  I'll show you a real man.  Don't my boobs look like Mickey's back? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God, Rock.  How the hell are you going to bed with that?  I don't know.  I think I'm punching me.  What else do you have to prove, Rocky?  Hey, can you put a little feeling into it, Talia?  Jesus Christ, you're not even acting anymore. 
[02:44:00]  You can't blame you never do it, Rocky.  Come on.  Tell me something.  Tell me something.  Just give me my check.  I can't pay the rent, Rocky.  Cut me, Mickey. 
[02:44:30]  Cut me.  Are you right to find that?  No, I mean cut my throat.  You see how I'm married, too?  Oh, stop it.  The throat, there is no more money.  Yeah, you sound a little more excited.  Eye of a tiger, Rocky.  Eye of a tiger.  Brown eye of a tiger.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:45:00]  I took words in my face after the first Apollo Creed fight.  Fate through first blood.  Oh, wait a minute.  Everyone!  Everyone!  We did it, everyone!  Everyone!  Oh, Rocky.  Rocky, you're going to have to train harder than ever. 
[02:45:30]  This is great.  Yeah, them greasy meat claps out of my face.  Rocky Balboa!  All right, before I go to line 11, Anthony...  Anthony took a close-up.  Mickey threw himself down the stairs.  Anthony, yeah.  Before we go to line 11, I suggest everyone slows down about 10 miles.  All right. 
[02:46:00]  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, can I just ask Patty a question?  Yeah, go ahead.  When's the new Rush album coming out?  Thank you.  Well, Patty, you look a little like Getty, ladies.  Just a little.  Getty?  You're a good singer.  I take that as a, well, a really bad insult. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Denise, what's up?  You guys got to stop.  You're killing me.  I'm sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on my way to Kennedy Airport, and I'm about five  months pregnant, and I'm peeing in my pants.  Literally, you guys have to stop.  I have no control.  Please, please put Patty alone.  She's sitting there just in her towel, too.  She's just standing there in her towel.  Oh, my God.  You guys have to stop.  I'm going to go into labor.  Forget pee.  All right, Denise.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.  You, too.  Let's go to Brendan. 
[02:47:00]  Brendan, what's up?  I just figured that maybe Rocky could have Stalker Patty go on the glass table.  Well, Sylvester Stallone, rumored to like that.  The Cleveland steamer on the glass down table.  There you go.  Okay, crawl under the table, Rocky.  All right, Denise.  I'm going to get under this glass table.  I want you to take the biggest jump you can and work one up and just squat right over  my face.  Okay, Rocky.  Here comes one.  I've been eating at McDonald's.
