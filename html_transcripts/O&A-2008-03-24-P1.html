<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Paul McCartney's separation from Heather Mills McCartney, quickly descending into vulgar jokes about Mills's prosthetic leg.  Opie shared personal anecdotes about his own marital experiences, and listener calls contributed further Beatles-related puns and jokes focusing on Mills's disability. The conversation then veered to Anthony's recent Home Depot visit, sparking a lengthy, humorous discussion about the store's perceived appeal to men, fueled by caller anecdotes suggesting a hidden, possibly strip-club-related, subculture within Home Depot. Anthony also detailed his new, oversized bed.  The show then featured a segment on unusual Hallmark cards dealing with sensitive topics like miscarriage, child loss, and cancer.  The hosts read cards aloud, punctuated by listener calls and more off-color jokes.  Bret Michaels and Chris Cornell provided pre-recorded intros during the broadcast.

Next, the hosts tackled a segment on absurd Hallmark cards, followed by a discussion of foot fungus, treatments, locker room hygiene, and proper foot-drying techniques.  Much of this discussion revolved around the misinterpretation of a Hallmark card reading "Talk about a C word," generating numerous inappropriate interpretations from the hosts and callers.  The show then shifted to a detailed, graphic discussion of deaths at Disneyland, including alleged cover-ups, with guest Patrice O’Neal contributing dark humor and anecdotes. The conversation included criticisms of Disney’s outdated technology and personal anecdotes from Anthony.  Further tangents included Anthony's dating life, a lost Lakers jersey, and a brief mention of a book detailing alleged Disney scandals, including pedophilia. A humorous story from previous guests Otto and George about an encounter with a woman with a prosthetic arm was recounted, followed by a discussion of Oprah's book club and a mocking of Anthony's reading habits by Opie, concluding with a debate on Gina Davis's appearance.

The show continued with the story of "Fat Nick," a hate crime victim, involving detailed discussions of the incident and the 911 call, interspersed with jokes. This led to a debate about the owner of Geno's Steaks and his "English only" policy, touching upon cultural sensitivities and the requirement to speak English in America.  Joey Vento, the owner of Geno's, called in to defend his policy, using expletives and making offensive remarks about various ethnic groups. He claimed the policy was misinterpreted and that it had boosted his business, vehemently rejecting accusations of prejudice.  Vento also criticized the city council's priorities.

The final segment focused on abandoned cars. Anthony described abandoning a broken-down car and using a U-Haul, while Opie shared stories about his father abandoning cars. A repo man, Brett, recounted a violent encounter with a customer, and caller Gerard questioned the hosts' car-abandonment practices.  This sparked a discussion of the hosts' past financial struggles and repossession experiences, culminating in Opie's recounting of a particularly difficult repossession that led to job loss and the temporary loss of all his possessions.

[00:01:00]  WXRK New York, it's the O.P. 
[00:01:30]  WXRK New York, it's the O.P.  WXRK New York, it's the O.P. 
[00:02:00]  WXRK New York, it's the O.P. 
[00:02:30]  WXRK New York, it's the O.P. 
[00:03:00]  WXRK New York, it's the O.P. 
[00:03:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things, some people don't want you to say 
[00:04:00]  this, some people don't want you to say that, some people think if you mention some things  they might happen, some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst, you're listening to the worst, not the best, the absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful. 
[00:04:30]  I wish neighbors, I wish neighbors, people in my neighborhood, install a generator that kicks in.  I don't care if it's just for my house.  You should just get your own generator. 
[00:05:00]  I could do that.  Why not?  Hey, why not?  Why not?  I should do that.  All right.  Generator for the house.  Order that.  Well, the Paul McCartney thing's getting pretty interesting.  It's got legs.  It's got leg.  One.  It's got leg.  Yeah, God, did we go off on that yesterday at the end of the show.  Yeah, the second half of the O.P. and Anthony show, exclusively on XM, was just terrific.  It was just terrific yesterday.  A free-for-all of comics just going off for about a half hour on Mrs. McCartney's leg and their breakup, the breakup of their marriage. 
[00:05:30]  Well, the headline in the post today, Paul's sick of stormy heather.  Stormy heather because it sounds like weather.  And what it would be with.  Oh, boy.  They're just terrific with the headlines in the post, aren't they?  Wow.  Very clever every single day.  They had nothing but cleverness from the New York Post.  But I was reading this story this morning thinking, man, you would think a Beatle, Paul McCartney in particular, would have the perfect marriage. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  You would think someone like Paul McCartney wouldn't have to deal with a bad marriage, a nagging wife.  Right.  A legend.  There's a lot of people out there in horrific marriages, but they don't have a choice, really.  Where are they going?  No.  Exactly.  So they're stuck.  They didn't write yesterday.  Yeah.  They didn't write yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  You would think if you wrote yesterday, you would have the perfect marriage.  After Let It Be, you should be able to strangle your wife every time she gets mouthy.  And apparently she was lipping off to him.  Well, let me read this.  This is just unbelievable.  Paul McCartney's marriage is beyond help.  Oh, I get it.  Oh, I get it.  Help.  Another song.  Can they stop with the song title?  Is it because she has one leg and she's a day tripper?  All right. 
[00:07:00]  Okay.  It could be funny.  All right.  Get all the Beatles songs.  Get the catalog in front of us, please.  Immediately.  Paul McCartney's marriage is beyond help because he's sick and tired of his wife's constant nagging,  according to published reports.  He's got a nagger.  A nagger.  He had a nagger.  Oh, boy.  That used to be illegal.  He had a nagger.  Oh, I got you.  A nagger.  Goddamn nagger. 
[00:07:30]  You know, the girls.  Who the hell likes a nagger?  No one.  When you sit there and they are just going at you.  He's a nagger lover.  Map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map.  A lot of guys crave that because their mothers are like that.  Yeah.  A lot of guys crave a nagger?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Yep.  Anyway.  Enough is enough, he told pals before making the blockbuster announcement Wednesday that  he is going to split up with his ex-model.  Sir Paul is said to be upset over a campaign of shrew-like behavior by 38-year-old Heather 
[00:08:00]  Mills McCartney.  That last name, right there alone, gives him the right to do anything he wants with her.  Heather Mills McCartney.  Not Heather Mills.  Just getting on his case.  What a dumb broad.  You have one leg and you land in a beetle.  Shut your mouth.  Yeah.  She was a...  You know, though, when you're married to a nagger, they can't help it.  They really can't. 
[00:08:30]  It's in their genes.  It's in their genes.  It's part of their personality.  I was married to a nagger.  I was.  You, Anthony?  I was married...  Married to a nagger?  To a nagger for nine years.  Just got nagged about a lot of things.  I'd come home and it would start, you know?  What I didn't do.  I didn't do my chores.  My chore was doing a goddamn radio show and bringing home what they call the bacon. 
[00:09:00]  Attaboy.  Bringing home the...  I was the breadwinner.  And I'd come home and...  And what did I get?  Well, I see the garbage is piling up.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is, nagger.  But I am half of the O.P. and Anthony show.  I would turn around and just go...  So go after yourself.  I'd go, nagger, please.  Just get off my back. 
[00:09:30]  And, you know, I finally, you know, finally showed her after nine years.  That's right.  Here's half of everything.  Here's half of everything.  That's right.  You showed her.  You don't get it all.  You showed her.  Nine years later.  When you're an ex-Beatle and you're married to a one-legged broad, here's how every discussion should go.  Okay.  I'm a little tired.  Are you, honey?  Oh, it's sunny out. 
[00:10:00]  Is it, honey?  Tickle, tickle, tickle.  Every conversation.  I haven't showered in three weeks.  You haven't, honey?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, Bill from Waterford.  Oh, crap.  It just updated.  Hold on a minute.  Where is it?  It did.  It did. 
[00:10:30]  It did.  What happened?  You're kidding.  You're kidding.  The instant feedback's going nuts here.  Bill in Waterford.  I heard Paul was seeing a mistress named Michelle, his bell.  Oh, yeah.  Did you hear that?  We're at the water cooler.  You dope.  All right.  Moving on here.  She allegedly belittled him about his age.  Holy.  How can she even be alive?  She allegedly belittled him about his age, complained about people he worked with. 
[00:11:00]  Complained with people he worked with.  Wait a minute.  Even Paul McCartney's not safe from one of these naggers.  It's not like he's just working at some office.  It's not like he's got a bunch of buddies that have regular jobs and they're hoping to get a little band together for some weekend gigs.  The guy works with legends.  Right.  He's been knighted.  He's Sir Paul McCartney.  Oh.  He should be untouchable.  He is untouchable.  What a dump.  So she complained about people he worked with and even had the gall to mock the most famous songwriter in pop music history because his most recent album did not do as well as he had hoped. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  He must have just laid there just going, what am I doing?  I'm Paul McCartney.  Do you think one day he was in the shower humming, get back?  And he said, Jesus, I wrote that.  I can dump her.  I could dump this broad.  Why would you tolerate that?  What have you contributed?  Stupid model. 
[00:12:00]  What have you done besides have headphones on in 93 and not heard the of the oncoming motorcycle?  And you know Paul can go out there, it doesn't matter what his age is, what he looks like, anything, and score some girl in her 20s.  Any time he wants.  Or whatever, just a nice girl.  Whatever.  Yeah, that means something.  Dude, he's, well, he's 60.  I mean.  But I mean, she's, the thing is, she's ragging about his age. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, I seriously.  He can go out.  And get whatever.  And, you know, trump her by getting a two-legged girl.  That's half her age.  All right.  38.  38.  That might be good.  19, yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  That works.  Twice the legs, half the wrinkles.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  So it moves on.  For her part, Heather has been telling friends that the former Beatle is equally to blame for not showing much concern when she was forced to deal with complications from her leg, which was amputated in 1993 after a motorcycle accident. 
[00:13:00]  He's quite tired of hearing about it.  Really?  Enough about the leg!  I pretend you have it.  He's always got an Afghan over her from the knees down.  They're at the beach.  You look a little chilly, love.  Perhaps a blanket.  We're at the beach, Paul.  Yes, I know.  Just put it on.  I don't like being reminded.  Put sand on it.  Do you mind if I bury you today? 
[00:13:30]  I'll bet you she'd lay there.  He just buries her the second they get to the beach.  No, it's good fun, isn't it?  Where she'd lay out there and he'd get some water and he'd, like, mold a sand extension so it looked like.  And then he'd have sex with her.  Like the one leg was just sand covered.  And then in the winter, let's go outside and make a snow leg.  Can you imagine how awful her snow angel must have looked?  Oh, God. 
[00:14:00]  Stupid stump pushing snow all.  Willy nilly.  Bunching it up in a place it shouldn't be.  By the way, Bill from Waterford is fighting back.  Jimmy, no, I didn't hear it near the water cooler.  I heard it from Eleanor Rigby.  All right.  Bill's really letting me have it.  And then Ron from Brooklyn.  His wife goes to Home Depot for a pedicure.  They're just coming in like crazy.  He just didn't like the leg that she kept in a jar by the door. 
[00:14:30]  Who was it for?  Your wife.  How do we get sucked into this stupid song, bitch?  We just can't resist.  I can't get away.  Any type of wordplay that makes fun of her leg gone.  Well, Bert from Philly, she belittled him.  It keeps updating what I want to read.  She belittled him, so he bewittled her down a few notches.  Ah, whittle her down, right. 
[00:15:00]  There you go.  Someone's going to have to keep track of the instant feedback.  It's just updating way too fast to keep up.  Get back.  Get back.  Get back your leg or you're gone.  Let's say hi to Sally in Chicago.  Sally, what's up?  Wait, Hawk just handed me one.  Steve from Bayside.  The long and wooden leg.  Pretty good.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, Zoltek from Philly.  I wonder if her leg is made of Norwegian wood. 
[00:15:30]  Maxwell's silver leg.  There's many we can go with here.  Sergeant Pepper.  Lonely legs club band.  One leg must just feel like a goose.  Looking over, seeing nobody.  No friend.  Silly collapsed pants.  It's like Jimmy.  Just wants love.  Just wants to be loved.  Somebody to be.  Another leg to stand next to.  He probably doesn't shave it that much.  No.  You know, the shaving must be so awkward.  You know, the one goes all the way down to the toes.  The other one is like, ah!  Oh, I forgot.  How does she do that? 
[00:16:00]  Because a lot of girls shave.  They put the leg up on either the shower, the end of the shower, or the toilet.  Something equally as sexy.  And then they shave their leg.  If she does that, she's on the floor.  She probably shaves while she's on the bowl.  It's called killing two birds with one stone.  Neither of them attractive.  It's nothing sexy.  Killing two birds with one motorcycle.  Let's go to Sally in Chicago.  Sally.  They'd have a fight, and he'd keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  And then it wouldn't. 
[00:16:30]  Of course.  And that ain't going to happen.  Happiness is a wood leg.  McCartney, a romantic heartthrob to millions and a famous animal lover, felt he was falsely  accused of having a cold heart.  Paul decided he had enough.  He's someone who's had adulation and praise almost all his life, but he felt with Heather  he could never do right.  Can you believe that?  Who is the veg?  Who's the veggie?  The vegetarian?  Him.  Is it him?  Yeah.  He's big on Amorites.  And she...  Linda McCartney, I think, got him in the house.  Yeah, Linda.  And that helped her. 
[00:17:00]  Keep her healthy.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  You could add a steak there, woman.  But was she into that?  Probably on some level.  I'm sure.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, sure.  Because I know they get peeved watching people eat burgers and stuff.  Any backstage things that happen?  You can't have any meat back there at all?  Kenny, have something to contribute?  She's a big animal rights activist.  Yeah.  She's with Pete and everything.  So is his daughter, Stella.  Yeah.  Another big...  Well, Stella didn't like Heather.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Is it true that motorcycle accident thing is just a cover-up that she caught her leg in  a trap and had to chew it off, and that's why she's an animal rights activist?  If Professor Anthony says so, it's got to be gospel.  I've got a mic in front of me.  It must be true.  I don't blame his kids for hating Heather.  Yeah, Stella McCartney Gold Digger.  It's not like Heather.  Good.  Yeah, that said exactly that.  Matt in Indiana.  Yeah.  If you're a nagger lover, would you have humble fever?  Car crash.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  I'm a little too far, and I don't understand what he's even talking about.  We're talking about nagging wives and girlfriends like Heather Mills, and I was in a relationship  there for a few years.  As a matter of fact, today would have been my wedding anniversary.  How many years?  What year would it have been?  I was married in 1990.  It's supposed to be 16.  It would have been 16 years.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  And, of course, the only reason I know that today would have been my anniversary is because 
[00:18:30]  the listeners reminded me, because they all know, because it ended up in the newspaper  during my divorce proceeding, because I was on the stand.  I was asked by none other than fat, bloated attorney Dominic Barbara, who my wife hired  as her attorney.  Anthony, can you tell me what date you were married?  When was your wedding date? 
[00:19:00]  And I sat there like a deer in headlights, and I had to answer, I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I get it mixed up because I lived out in San Juan Capistrano, California, for many years  when I was growing up.  And Swallows Day, big festival out there, the Fiesta de las Galantrinas, and the Swallows  would come back to Capistrano.  It's a legend.  Everyone knows about it.  And that was March 19th.  So I couldn't figure out if it was March 19th or May 19th. 
[00:19:30]  It was equally as important to me, my marriage and Swallows Day.  Hey, look, if you associate your marriage with Swallows Day, it couldn't have been all  bad.  Very good.  Joe's got a good one.  I hope he pulls it off.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  Yeah.  Paul knew it was time to let her go when he called himself humming, here comes the stump 
[00:20:00]  every time she walked in the room.  Here comes the stump.  Do, do, do, do.  It's so wrong.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Very good.  Comes the stump.  So, there you have it.  The latest on Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  We got cigarette ads.  We got Tyra Banks going to prison.  You want to take a break and get into the Tyra Banks stuff?  Tyra's good, man.  I like her.  Oh, we can't get enough of Tyra Banks.  She does a good show.  Yeah.  Because she makes it all about herself. 
[00:20:30]  I guess Tyra Banks, what, spent three hours in prison?  Yeah.  And now she's claiming she knows how it's, how it's like to be in prison.  Than, you saw the show.  We've, we've, we made Than watch the Tyra Banks show.  Oh, that's not even a Paul McCartney song.  But is this true?  That whenever she, Paul had to grab a wrench when she started singing Foot Loose?  Hey.  That could get annoying.  Hey, by the way, Axel in New York raises an excellent point. 
[00:21:00]  If Heather gets half of Paul's money, she's still only going to be nagger rich.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, of course.  Mike from Kentucky.  Shake it up, baby, now.  Limp and shout.  All right.  Foot Loose.  Foot Loose.  That's the one right there.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ. 
[00:21:30]  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Okay, here we go.  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison,  and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Damn.  Did you watch the Golden Globes last night?  Speaking of TV, Anthony?  No.  Actually, I did miss the Golden Globes.  I'm hoping you can enlighten me a little bit.  Wait.  I got to get into your head a little bit.  You didn't get the pay-per-view.  Yeah.  You didn't watch the Sopranos.  Uh-huh.  You didn't watch the Golden Globes. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  What the hell were you doing last night?  Um, I had to go to Home Depot.  Why?  I'm in a new place, Opie.  You're not a Home Depot type of guy.  I had to go to Home Depot.  Ah.  I'm in a new place now.  Uh-huh.  And I needed things.  My goal in life is to never, ever purchase something from Home Depot.  Well, you got to go in there, Opie.  When you, when you, uh, well, you get an apartment or something like that, you want to get some 
[00:22:30]  stuff for it, you know, ceiling fans.  I needed a couple of ceiling fans, you know?  And I install them myself, you know, Opie.  I see.  Yes.  So I was doing that.  It's open 24 hours.  So you're like a Home Depot geek now, or what?  No.  I just, you know, you got to go.  I'm not in there all the time.  I just went in there to, uh, to get some stuff.  And then I had to get new tools because, uh, I threw my tools away when I ended my construction 
[00:23:00]  career.  Now I needed new tools.  You know, there's something going on with Home Depot because my dad goes there just to  go.  Just to go.  There has to be a booby bar in the back that, that someone should tell me about because.  A toddler's joint in the back of every Home Depot.  Because I hear, hear about this from time to time.  My dad, he'll just leave the house on a Saturday.  Yep.  Going to Home Depot.  He's not, he's not building anything.  Why is he going to Home Depot?  Home Depot.  It's where, uh, I guess, uh, the men can hang out.  Is there a back room with some, uh, chicks? 
[00:23:30]  Ah, you're onto it.  That's it.  There's a back room.  Strip club.  You know, that would be a brilliant marketing ploy, though.  Have a strip club right next to Home Depot.  Oh, yeah.  You would clean up.  Hell yeah.  Absolutely clean up.  So that's what, uh, that's what I was up to.  Home Depot.  Yeah, yeah.  You know how it is.  Anthony.  I got my new bed.  Yeah, what's up?  I heard about your new bed.  It is the most gigantic bed ever in the history of beds.  Hold on, Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  It's men.  How big is this bed?  It's the biggest bed I ever saw in my life.  And, uh, the people from Rockaway Bedding, they, uh, deliver it.  And, uh, I don't know how the hell they got it into this apartment.  But they did it.  They're like, uh, magic people over there.  And, uh, oh, it is, you, you laugh your ass off if you saw the size of this thing.  Well, I hope I never have to see your bed, Anthony.  You will never, ever even come into my apartment.  All right, good. 
[00:24:30]  Ever.  Oh, what do you mean, man?  But, yeah.  Why?  I just said I don't want to be in your bedroom.  I'd like to see your new place.  All right, but, uh, you'd have to take the little tour.  You know, everybody, you've got to take the tour.  I'd like to, uh, see a new place if you can find time to, you know, put some clothes on.  What is that supposed to mean?  And have the guys over for once.  It'll be nice.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I don't even know what you're talking about.  Okay.  Are you insinuating that maybe I'm using this bed to bang on? 
[00:25:00]  I didn't say that.  It's a big bed.  Huge bed.  I can't wait until the fine people at Rockaway Bedding start advertising with us again.  All right.  Dave, what's up?  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, over in Bloomfield, New Jersey, there's a Home Depot off the parkway, off Exit 148.  If you drive through the Home Depot parking lot, there's a go-go bar, titillations.  Titillations.  That's the Home Depot.  That's perfect.  How funny is that?  I go to every Saturday.  My wife thinks I'm out of Home Depot. 
[00:25:30]  You bring home a couple studs and everyone is happy.  That's right.  That's right.  All right, Dave.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Another guy saying the same thing on line three.  Yeah.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  All right.  Yo, Opie, big F you, man.  Why?  What's wrong with Home Depot, man?  I work at Home Depot and Comac.  I just don't like building stuff.  Is this the guy?  You don't like building stuff.  You need to come.  You're lazy, man.  I am. 
[00:26:00]  I'm on it.  I don't own my own place, so there's no reason to go to Home Depot yet.  Well, not everyone can afford to hire people to build things for them.  No, it's not.  I don't.  No, you know something?  We've got to stop you right there.  Trust me.  I'll even back up on this.  It isn't even that he's rich where he doesn't have to get people to build himself.  He just has no clue, first of all, how to be handy in the least.  Get a clue.  It's so easy.  You really don't.  I'm sorry to say it. 
[00:26:30]  It's not really your forte.  I just don't like building stuff.  I don't own my own place.  I'm going to be in trouble when I eventually own my own place because I have no desire to  do that crap.  Sounds that way.  No desire.  Well, there's nothing wrong with Home Depot, man.  There are guys there.  A lot of Home Depot employees who listen to ONA every day.  That's okay.  We say hi to you guys.  I was in there last night, the one in Brooklyn.  There's just a lot of guys get really excited to go to Home Depot.  I don't get it.  There's a lot of retorts who come in there, too, man.  They don't know what they're looking for, what they're doing. 
[00:27:00]  They expect us to read their minds.  I've had to go there with friends and stuff, and I just don't get it.  It's a drag to me.  I don't like it.  Sal from Long Island?  Corporate America you don't like.  Huh?  Corporate America you don't like.  Good point.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Sal from Long Island saying,  Shut up, Opie.  Home Depot rules.  I bought stuff there at 2 in the morning to build a bong.  There you go.  All right.  2 in the morning to build a bong.  A bong.  I need some fittings, some short pieces of pipe. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, Bill, you're next.  What's going on, guys?  All right.  I just want to let you know, in Lodi, they have the Lodi Home Depot, and across the street  is Satin Dolls, and that's the Bada Bing.  Oh, is that Bada Bing's from The Sopranos?  That's the Bada Bing's from The Sopranos.  No kidding.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Later.  Bye.  Now, Tony's on line eight.  He supports me as far as the Home Depot stand goes.  The Home Depot.  Now it's a stand.  For the love of God, I hope he doesn't sound, you know, imagine? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I support you.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Please be manly.  Tony, what's up?  Yeah, no, I don't sound like that, guys.  All right.  Thank God.  Listen, I'm a newlywed.  We just bought a house, right?  And we do a lot of renovations, painting, crap like that.  You go into the Home Depot, and this place is so frigging big, and there's never nothing  where you can get to it.  You can't get nobody to help you.  The place, it's a hellhole.  You're standing around looking for a bunch of stupid high school kids who don't know  their ass from their elbow. 
[00:28:30]  It's ridiculous.  Jesus.  I mean, you need these little mom and pop neighborhood joints where you can go in, you can ask somebody  a question, get what you need, and get the hell out and do what needs to be done.  And they know your name, God damn it.  Yeah.  All right, Tony, thank you.  Take care, guys.  Peace.  What is Jason saying on line one?  Jason, what's up?  Yeah, I want you to stop talking about it.  I mean, I'm going to get home.  My wife's going to be like, hey, now I know why every single night you're going out to  Home Depot.  Crazy.  Hey, Anthony, let me ask you a question.  You used to install like air conditioning and everything. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Now, I used to install alarms also.  Now, I remember one time we were installing an alarm and there was a drop ceiling and I'm  looking through the drop ceiling and I'm staring at this girl taking a shower.  It's the best job ever.  It's the only reason why I stayed with this job.  Yeah, yeah.  I think everybody snuck a peek at some point if you're in construction.  But the Home Depot is a grown-up man's toy store.  That's what it is.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  We got Justine on line four that works at Titillations that is located next to the Home 
[00:29:30]  Depot we were talking about a few minutes ago.  Justine, what's up?  Hey, I also work at Bada Bing, too, just so you know.  Oh, cool.  And they're right about the Home Depot.  It's 100% true.  Most of the guys, they say, yep, I'm supposed to be at Home Depot or they're on their way  there.  And the ones that are open 24 hours, it's even worse.  So if the ladies want to check the receipts on their guys.  No, no, don't.  Don't do that.  Just so you know.  I'm just telling the truth.  Sorry.  Don't do that to the guys.  They've probably paid you a lot of good money over the years.  Well, they pay great money, but I just want them to know, hey, my boyfriend goes, 
[00:30:00]  too.  I mean, he's always at the Home Depot.  So, you know, you tell me.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Thank you, Justine.  You're welcome.  Bye-bye.  All right.  We don't need to talk about Home Depot for the next half hours.  Just a quick comment from Anthony that he was at Home Depot yesterday.  I had to get some, get a few things.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  E-Rock just ran over with the cards.  What are those?  You remember the cards.  And I saw some of these in the stationery store the other day.  These are actual cards. 
[00:30:30]  We should just do this bit again.  Oh, wait a minute.  These are actual cards you could buy.  I mean, you got the graduation cards.  You got the birthday cards.  You got the engagement cards.  You got the, you even have the death cards.  A lot of specialty cards.  Yes, I'm so sorry.  You got the Valentine's Day cards.  You got the Mother's Day cards.  You understand about the cards.  You got your cards and then your seasonal cards.  Cards for everybody.  Stepmother now.  Well, recently Hallmark decided they weren't.  Step-grandmother.  They weren't making enough money from us. 
[00:31:00]  You know, at $3 a pop, by the way, for these cards.  Remember when these used to be like 37 cents or something like that?  Yeah.  Or whatever it was.  Do you adjust the card with the envelope when you hand it to the checkout person so they  can't see which card you picked?  Fan?  See?  I do the same thing.  I take it.  Now, I know that the UPC code's on the back of the card.  Right.  So, I take it and I take the envelope and I put the flap, I put the card between the  flap of the envelope and the envelope body itself so it's all together.  Now, the front of the card is covered with the envelope and I hand it to them with that 
[00:31:30]  so they could just scan the UPC because I don't want them knowing my business.  I don't want them knowing that I'm giving this card.  I don't want them like goofing on a funny mommy card that I get or something like that.  So, I just hand it to them.  None of your goddamn business.  Ring it up.  Are you talking about cards or porno magazines?  Cards.  I know.  It sounds like porno, doesn't it?  Right.  No, porno I'll just grab and...  Who gives a crap?  So, the dumb fat lady behind the counter goes, oh, whose birthday is it?  It's not...  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to hear that and the people behind me. 
[00:32:00]  I don't want...  Because I'll do that.  I'll look at somebody that's buying cards and I'll kind of peer if I'm behind them  and look and think, ugh, I bet that person's a jerk just like the person that's standing  in front of me.  And I'll start judging people just by the cards that they're buying.  So, I have to cover it up and then do it that way.  But how else...  That kind of is the only way to hand it to them.  It's like...  Because you'd look silly like if you hand the card with your right hand and then the envelope  like if you put the left up and made the... 
[00:32:30]  No, but some people just take the envelope and put it behind the card and hand it to  them.  Oh.  And now the person's got it.  First of all, it's inconvenient for them because now they've got to flip it over and scan it  that way.  Mine is for easy scanning, but that isn't the reason I do it.  It's so they can't read my card.  I don't want them knowing who the card's for, what I chose, what picture on the front I decided  to go with.  And they always have to comment about having a nice purchase or, oh, that's a nice card.  And I have to be alone in the card section so when I pick a card out, I don't like picking 
[00:33:00]  it out, which is horrible because the last minute Mother's Day card or something like  that, everyone's flying in the ravaged, savaged Mother's Day card section and there's only  like eight left.  I'm the guy, I'll read cards and I'll go, if I was a writer, I would have wrote, I would  have wrote this right here.  If I was a writer.  If I was a writer.  But I'm not.  This is what I would have wrote.  If I actually cared about the person. 
[00:33:30]  I have to wait until people clear out.  And then I'll start looking because there's something that bugs me when I see people looking  through cards and they're like, this is not, and they talk to each other.  Like the two women are like, it, it, it, it, it, it, talking about the card.  They'll be like, this is nice.  Oh, look at the cover.  No, look at this one.  Read this one.  And I'm just standing there going, ugh, ugh.  I know, it's terrible, they're being caring and nice.  I hate it.  I don't like people knowing what I'm doing.  You ever pick out a card for a loved one and, and, and you're reading and you're like, man, 
[00:34:00]  this person's not this nice, but I'll, I'll throw them a bone.  There's some, there's some, it's true, there's some that you read and it's like, you've been  there every moment I've needed you and stuff.  It's like, no, you haven't.  I'm like, half this crap's not true, but, ah, she's getting older now.  What the hell?  Let her have her moment.  Stan's gearing up.  Yeah.  I'll call that Mother's Day opening.  When I, when I started this tiny little bit, I'm thinking, oh boy, here comes Stan with 
[00:34:30]  another story about mother.  Oh, mother.  Stan's been probably writing his mother cards.  I remember a picture of Stan and that little kid going, excuse me, teacher, what rhymes  with castrating?  Yeah, I'm like, oh boy, half this crap's not true, but, ah, what the hell?  They don't, they don't write this sociopath Mother's Day card for the sociopath.  But that's what I'm getting at.  They write cards for other occasions.  Other occasions that. 
[00:35:00]  I know we did this bit, but we're talking about cards and it is Iraq, uh, Tober.  I don't remember, I don't remember these either.  You really don't?  No.  These are actual Hallmark cards.  I swear to God, other radio shows would do this as a, as a bit.  This is not a bit.  You can buy these cards.  We can even show them online.  Uh, here's a card, uh, describe the front.  Uh, it's, um, sort of a rose, um, modern art looking.  It's a nice, it's a flower.  If Pablo Picasso drew a flower.  Yeah.  It looks like, uh, it was, it's, it belongs in South Park. 
[00:35:30]  It looks like clipped paper things.  The petals are all askew.  It's raised.  It's a raised petal.  It looks like a little piece of candy you could tear off and eat up.  It's so yummy and good looking.  Hopefully a little child can choke on it.  It looks like a flower in Whoville.  Whoville.  Uh, and well, this is what the card says.  And it's a very soft, orangey color.  Yeah.  Very soft, orange, very easy on the eyes.  Orangey, yellow.  Uh, I swear to God, this is an actual card.  It reads, I wish I could make things happen for you the way you want them to. 
[00:36:00]  I know how much a child would mean to you.  I'm still hoping and believing for you and keeping you in my heart.  You don't remember these cards?  What is that for, though?  Wait a minute.  That's, that's for, uh, that's, that's in the section of, uh, for your friend with a  barren womb.  Yes.  That's exactly what it's for.  Okay.  Why would you send this card to someone?  Friend with a barren womb.  It's a picture of a uterus with a tumbly blowing across it. 
[00:36:30]  I would, fallopian tubes with dust on them.  I would send this card out and I would sign it in with crayons and I would, uh, I would  smear birthday cake all over the front and fudge and stuff.  Just think of all the money you're saving and then in parentheses and all the hugs and  love you're not getting.  That's kind of.  And a SpongeBob sticker I would just place somewhere on the card.  Why would you send this, though? 
[00:37:00]  All kidding aside.  Yeah.  Really?  What?  I don't think they want to be reminded.  Dear old rotten eggs.  Well, here's, here, here, dear dinosaur eggs.  You guys don't really, you don't remember these cards?  Oh yeah, I do.  Absolutely.  All right.  The next one.  Oh, that's nice.  It's sort of a, a very, uh, heavily backlit.  So it's almost silhouette, a child on a swing.  And that's all you say, right?  All right.  Well, the card reads, uh, children bring us a lot of joy, but sometimes they bring heartache 
[00:37:30]  too.  Yeah.  I care so much about you and your family.  I'm thinking about you and hoping things will get better.  It's a death card.  No.  That's a, that's a kid in trouble.  Is that a kid in trouble?  I think it's a death card.  Read it again.  Read it again.  No, it's not, it's not, uh, uh, schmalsy enough.  And there's no, I'm sorry for the boss.  Then why the little girl on a swing?  Because you got to remember when your child was like that and not the heroin addicted  slut she is now.  The, the emo mess that she is. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  You know, she's 35 and retarded and still on the sling.  Sorry.  She never, wow.  All right.  I don't feel as bad about this one because this one really creeped me out.  Yeah.  I don't think that's a death card.  It's a kid in trouble.  I think so.  It's not a death card.  Children bring us a lot of joy, but sometimes they bring heartache too.  Heartache.  Yeah.  I care so much about you and your family.  I'm thinking about you and hoping things will get better.  Okay.  Maybe it's a sick kid.  Maybe.  Could probably be both.  Yeah.  You know, because, well, that's considered kind of sick too.  Maybe she's like psychologically sick or, uh, you know, ready to die. 
[00:38:30]  Roses are red, violets are blue.  That hair looked good on Pete Rose.  It looks good on your kid too.  Let's go to Scott in Clinton, New Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Dude, I can't stand it.  I was listening to Anthony and, uh, sometimes when I'm in the store, I do the exact same  thing with the, uh, uh, the UPC symbol.  But, uh, anytime I see someone laughing at a card, I have to see what they're laughing 
[00:39:00]  at.  And I always take the card or after it.  And I'm like, what the hell are they laughing at?  Yeah.  See, that's another thing.  You can't like laugh at the cards.  Most people look and go, what are they laughing at?  Most cards have no laugh.  They're not funny.  Oh, look.  80 things pop up on springs when you open it up.  Whoa.  Isn't that funny?  Look.  No, it's not.  Two chimps biting a guy's face and groin.  And it's happy reconstructive surgery.  That would be an amusing card.  That would be an amusing card. 
[00:39:30]  It would be.  Uh, let's go to Mike in Toronto.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  I was at a one-year-old birthday party yesterday and, uh, it was all cute.  The kid was, uh, smothering, uh, blue icing all over his face and there was pictures and,  uh, flashballs going off all over the place.  Especially when, about three minutes later, he puked it all back up all over the cake.  So, I would gladly take cake with drool.  That's wonderful.  Not the puke cake.  Isn't that great?  All right.  Thank you, Mikey.  Hey, by the way, uh, the whole linger longer bit that's kind of taken off, uh, got to give 
[00:40:00]  a plug to Whack Bag.  They started kind of a linger longer thread.  Ooh, yeah.  And it's smart.  For the, for maybe the newer listeners, they're like, linger, well, I, I, I wasn't listening  back then.  I wasn't lingering.  They're kind of explaining some of the linger longer things that we've been doing on the  show lately.  Waddle-dee-doodle.  Uh, here's another card.  It's just, uh, very yellow with a hint of, uh, orange in it.  Yeah, another one.  Very soft.  Hallmark looking for other markets with their, uh, with their cards.  Well, this one reads, no one said it would be easy to lose your hair. 
[00:40:30]  But knowing you, you'll find a way to turn this situation around and use it as a badge  of honor.  Oh, good luck at Columbia.  A sign to the world that your treatments are working.  Oh, okay.  The big casino card.  You hope so.  What's funny about this card, there's one single curly hair on the, in the inside of  the card.  How did that get there?  Ew.  That didn't come with the card. 
[00:41:00]  It certainly didn't come from the person reading it.  And when this is all behind you and your hair grows back, you'll be able to say with  assurance that every day is a good hair day.  Unless, unless your hair is growing because your fingernails are too, because that's just  what happens.  Oh, Jesus.  I think if you're going through the chemo, I don't want, I don't think you'd want people  to, I don't think you want to be reminded that you're losing your hair.  It's just, I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  I haven't been there, but it doesn't sound like that's what you'd want to be reminded.  That's probably someone very close.  It would have to be someone very close.  And, uh, you know, you had probably talked about it before.  It's a losing your hair because of chemo card.  Yes, Jim.  You know, I just think that there's such a better way to do that.  How about this?  And then under the same theme, roses are red, violets are blue.  Buy a hat already.  You're making everyone uncomfortable.  Let's get a, ah, yes.  The cancer music. 
[00:42:00]  I love this morbidly obese guy who's now dead.  The Hawaiian singing this.  What was his name?  Being with an I in there somewhere.  Oh, uh, Don Ho-Ho Eater.  Big pig.  Let's go to Chris and Rich.  Big pig.  Let's go to Chris and Richman.  Big slob.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You love the show?  Yep.  Thank you.  I was just wondering, I understand, I understand that you give Christmas cards at Christmas and  birthdays cards on your birthday, but when do you give the barren womb card? 
[00:42:30]  What's the appropriate day for that?  I don't know, because it wasn't about, it just seemed like it was about someone who  couldn't conceive.  That's what that was about.  Yeah, so when the hell do you give that out?  I mean, every 10 minutes.  I mean, if you're close.  Reminded all the time.  If you're close to the person, I'm sure you're having little chats and talking about it,  but to actually send a card, that's like, that's, I don't get that at all.  I was rummaging through my useless items in the basement and thought of your womb. 
[00:43:00]  Exactly.  Hey, how's that storage chest you call a uterus?  Awful me from WackFag.  It's okay, they're shooting radiation through your body.  Sorry, your hair fell out.  They're making their own cards on this feedback now.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Sorry about your bout with chemo.  Here's a copy of Finding Nemo.  As long as it rhymes.  Right.  It's a card.  Here's another one.  Anyone?  Stars in the sky.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, right at the top of the card is some stars, and then as you go down, another, a lot 
[00:43:30]  of pastels, clouds.  Whispy clouds.  And then a purplish landscape almost.  Very, very, like you said, easy on the eyes.  Actual Hallmark cards.  And the writing is always a very easy script writing.  I have known you in my dreams, little one, and there you will forever be loved.  Oh, boy.  Saying goodbye to what might have been the hopes and dreams that grew more real every 
[00:44:00]  day brings an added sadness to the depth of pain, wishing you gentle comfort for your  sorrow.  Wait, what is that one?  That's for, um...  That sounds like, uh, mis...  That's not, I don't know, could be, uh...  Is, is that, is that what it is?  What?  What, what, Jimmy?  I don't know, it's, let me see. 
[00:44:30]  Read it again.  I have known you in my dreams, little one, and there you will forever be loved.  Saying goodbye to what might have been the hopes and dreams that grew more real every  day brings an added sadness to the depth of pain, wishing you gentle comfort for your  sorrow.  Joanne from New Jersey is going to help us out with that one.  Joanne.  Ah, Joanne. 
[00:45:00]  Ah, Joanne.  Yes?  Hi, Joanna.  Okay, it's not a barren womb card, it's a miscarriage card.  Well, no, I think the one we just read might have been a miscarriage card.  Which one is the miscarriage card?  Uh, you know, sorry about, you know, you can't have a kid.  Wait, no, which one, though?  Which one?  Punching out.  Ow!  Oh, jeez.  Look.  No, don't punch out. 
[00:45:30]  She's not happy.  I should, I'm sorry.  I know, I'm tired.  Let me see, apologize in advance.  Why, long night at the hospital?  Oh, no.  Wait, Jimmy has to apologize in advance?  What?  For what, Jimmy?  Oh, my God.  Why is Jimmy writing?  I hear it so bad.  Roses are, oh, boy.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  Holy.  Oh, uh, hey, uh, thank you, Joanna. 
[00:46:00]  Thank you, Joanna, for the phone call.  How about the punchline after the break?  No, I want to hear it.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  Hold your horses, I'll get them up.  That's awful. 
[00:46:30]  There's a lot of cards coming in from Instant Feedback.  Print up the Instant Feedback.  All right, well, we'll do the, uh, the last, uh, four after the break.  Ugh.  I kind of did this bit already.  How did we get here today?  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  What up?  WXRK New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock. 
[00:47:00]  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Chris Cornell, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, hey, uh, Bill Springer from Syracuse.  He's having a busy morning.  He writes, hello, Bill.  Talking about these weird cards that Hallmark put out recently.  Mm-hmm.  Because they're not making enough money.  They're looking for new, uh, new, uh, new, uh, marketing opportunities.  Yeah, a few new angles on their, uh, cards.  Their greeting cards.  Bill Springer's got a card from Syracuse, New York.  The front of the card reads, I heard your whole family got shot. 
[00:47:30]  Which, inside it, it reads, so I turned up the volume on my stereo.  That, I don't think that one would go over very well.  That's kind of niche.  Mike from Jersey writes, uh, hey-o, here's a card.  Roses are red, violets are blue, Mets suck, boo-hoo-hoo.  Booty-hoo-dee-hoo.  Uh, uh, Poo-Poo Finger from San Diego.  Can you say Poo-Poo Finger on the air these days?  I don't know.  Well, I guess we'll find out. 
[00:48:00]  Uh, but he writes, sorry your husband committed suicide, but let's face it, you aren't exactly a catch.  Send that to Lady Di.  Yeah, we can do that.  Let's go to Matt in Philly.  Hey, uh, Matt, what's up?  Good morning, Opie.  I got a card for you.  Yeah.  It's, uh, violets are purple, roses are red.  Your team wasn't a lead, but now it's dead.  Oh, jeez.  It's going to be a long day.  It's going to get the gist of it, but. 
[00:48:30]  It's going to be long.  It's going to be a long day.  And I'm getting those phone calls from people.  Sorry about your Mets.  Yeah, I'm so sorry.  Because I had a lot to do with it.  Send prayer cards.  I was out there playing as hard as they were.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, here's one from Pat from Menaki.  Sorry about your cancer.  You prayed to God, but no was his answer.  Sorry about your toe.  Here's another card.  An actual card from Hallmark.  Uh, it's a pink card. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  I don't even want to read this one.  Oh, wait, let me guess.  It's a man gets to a father.  Oh.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  I saw your son kneeling in front of a hole.  It reads, you're a fighter, a survivor, an inspiration.  That's the front of the card.  Inside it says, keep that close to heart now.  Always.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  What is this about?  That's, well, since the other thing won't be close to the heart anymore.  Wait, you're a fighter, a survivor, an inspiration.  Keep that close to heart.  Now.  A fighter always.  You're right, got it.  Did I see it?  I got it, too.  I didn't actually.  Horrible.  You're a fighter, a survivor, an inspiration.  Yeah.  Keep that close to heart.  Now.  Always.  I don't know.  Is that like, I hope that guy got fired.  Yeah, that's a little too vague. 
[00:50:00]  A bit vague.  It could be anything somebody's.  What got lopped off?  The color, though, leads me to believe it would be a womanly problem.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's one.  It's, uh.  Can't even describe the front of this one.  What happened?  Don't rip it.  This is one of our best bits.  One of our best bits.  Best.  Yeah.  Jesus.  We're going to put this under the glass again and break when needed.  Here's another Hallmark card. 
[00:50:30]  Yes, Jimmy?  Sometimes you get something somebody said later and it just.  I know what you're going through is very, very hard.  Uh, let's go to Craig in Long Island.  I'm sorry to hear you're as flat as this card.  Think of it this way. 
[00:51:00]  You'll run faster.  No, you'll be running off to the right the whole time.  Or archery.  Hey, uh, let's say how to Craig in Long Island.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi.  Uh, all these cards.  I just wanted to know if they're signed by, uh, Omar Minaya to his fans.  Uh, to his fans or to the team?  Another Mets joke.  Enough about the Mets! 
[00:51:30]  Let's say, uh, well, let's, uh, read this one.  Uh, something, uh, just read the front of it here.  It's just a blue card for the most part.  One of the most difficult things we could do is to show our true selves to the world.  Yet, you found the courage to say, this is who I am.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  There's no telling what changes will follow.  That's good that the card is, uh, blue.  But living with the strength that comes from being everything you are, everything you are in very big letters. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Brings its own rewards.  You're fabulous.  And you deserve them all.  Yep.  Wow.  Signed, Martini Steve.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Now I know why you smelled like mothballs.  Look where you were standing all this time.  Doesn't rhyme.  Doesn't have to.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Tap, tap, tap.  Can I touch your shoe?  Wow. 
[00:52:30]  Macho man.  Oh, boy.  You know what?  Maybe I shouldn't read this next one.  You should.  We got two left here.  We should do it.  It's another flower with like a pinkish violet background. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It is difficult for others to understand.  Is it?  The depth of the loss we feel for the child who will never be born.  Oh, boy.  Why would you send this?  Just why would you send this?  Write a note.  Make a phone call.  Visit something.  You don't send a card that was written by someone else as this stock thing.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  A handwritten note.  Like, yeah.  For Mother's Day or for someone's birthday, you could use someone else's words.  But something as personal as this, you've got to write your own card.  People don't know.  I'll almost play devil's advocate.  Something like that happens.  People want to say something nice, but it's like they – people are awkward.  People can be awkward like when they're trying to compliment your girlfriend or your – they don't know what to say.  People are dumb.  So, like, they look at this and go, yeah, that's what I'm – you know, because you don't want to say the wrong thing. 
[00:54:00]  I think I always said about a miscarriage, right?  Yeah.  It's like you don't want to say the wrong thing.  So, you're like, eh, that sounds really beautiful.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Your kid looks like something you'd put in the stew.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious, goodness gracious, goodness gracious. 
[00:54:30]  I like turtles.  Yeah, I know.  Goodness gracious, goodness gracious.  Yeah, I know.  Goodness gracious.  Yeah, I want to apologize for that.  I am the werewolf.  Goodness gracious.  I like to make werewolf movies.  As I said it, I realized it was probably out of line.  This is what it sounds like when doves cry. 
[00:55:00]  She enticed me.  Goodness gracious.  Boozy, boozy, bop.  Diddy, bop.  Official endeavor.  Of course, let me.  Yes.  Just keep going.  You can always.  What?  Chocolate rain.  Don't feel so bad.  You can try again.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:55:30]  Throw that dress away.  You'll never get out the stain.  Chocolate rain.  I like turtles.  Yeah, I like turtles too.  Me and you, kid.  Me and you.  Oh, the inappropriate bell's going to need a little oiling.  He's got it.  And down he goes at the five-yard line.  What's the call here?  Now they're going to say no. 
[00:56:00]  He's out of bounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's horrible.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, come on.  All right, well.  Do you have to deal with things like that?  It is difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel for the child who will never be born.  Even those closest to us may wonder why we can't seem to get over it.  What they don't understand is how we already love that little one, and love never ends. 
[00:56:30]  Though the dreams and plans we had must be gently laid to rest, we each must take our own time and in our own way find the strength to let hope be a part of us once again.  If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.  Yeah.  I hold in my hand the final card.  Thank God.  Thank God.  When did you buy these? 
[00:57:00]  Thank God.  Travis bought them months ago.  Oh, we should get more.  This is about it, I think.  Chris from Philly writes on the Instant Feedback.  Today, Preston and Steve are shooting baseballs out of a pitching machine into one of their dudes' you-know-what down below there.  Okay.  Baseball theme.  They're doing it 14 times to commemorate the 14 seasons of Philly's losses.  How do you feel about this? 
[00:57:30]  Now to read these cards.  Yeah.  I'm pressing to see there'd be more than enough room for all those baseballs.  Now we'll stand up, the balls just tumble out.  Let's say hi to Shane in the Bronx.  The Bronx.  Shane.  Hey.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  A little card that I just saw at Hallmark.  Sorry you flushed your baby down the drain.  Chocolate rain.  That's supposed to be chocolate rain first, and it's just horrible. 
[00:58:00]  And for that, you get this.  I like turtles.  Yeah.  Mongo.  If you're going to say something, you do something like, you know, roses are red, violets are blue.  I was going to just buy your couch.  Can you throw the crib in, too?  Why?  Why?  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Why?  Look, I know it's horrible, but can you...  I can't get the thoughts out of my head. 
[00:58:30]  I have mental problems.  Let's go to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  Morning.  Got a card for you?  Yeah.  Sorry to hear you're moving so soon.  Go figure.  Because I hear you...  All right.  All right.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, Paula.  Jesus, man.  This bit is making me sweat, man.  I am sweating.  Feel my back.  It's so... 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  I can't feel it.  Nobody's putting the air conditioning on.  That'll help us.  I hold in my hand the final card.  Thank God.  I hope it's for foot fungus.  Because I really don't need any more of these.  I can't help myself.  I hope it's for an ingrown toenail or something because I can't handle this.  Yeah.  I've been using tough actin, tenactin, by the way.  Have you?  Yeah.  Is it tough actin?  That stuff sucks.  It does.  What?  It's not great.  Nope.  It's not working.  It works better.  Do you have foot fungus?  I don't know.  I was in the gym and when I go barefoot, like I always go when people walk and I just kind 
[00:59:30]  of shuffle along.  Shuffle?  Desinex.  Okay.  Better?  And another note to Tom.  I don't have stock in Desinex.  I'm just trying to help out a friend.  So relax.  I just think my girlfriend hates the way tenactin smells.  So I have to give myself a good tough actin, tenactin blast on the feet and then get in  bed and she's like, that stuff stinks.  That never worked for me.  Desinex all the way.  Okay.  All the way.  How about wearing something on your feet when you're in the gym locker room?  It's not even that.  Or something.  You want to help my foot fungus? 
[01:00:00]  I hold my Mac.  I'll tell you what it is.  I'll tell you what it is.  I'll tell you what it is.  What is it?  What is it?  Because people don't dry each individual toe when they get out of the shower.  Well, you should.  So you go into socks a little moist and if you're working out a lot and stuff, there's  a little action there as well.  Oh, boy.  It's a fungus.  And the fungus grows.  You should definitely dry.  How many people really dry each individual toe after getting out of the shower?  You got to.  Well, not everyone's a freak like yourself.  No, no.  I'm not a freak. 
[01:00:30]  You are a freak.  I'll dry my feet real fast, but you got to get all the moisture out from.  And in between the toes.  And then if you're working out on top of that, then there you go.  And then you don't get out of the shower and throw your socks on immediately.  Do you?  No.  But there's probably still some moisture there.  You're wearing them in the shower.  So I wash my socks.  I have foot shame.  That could be the problem.  You just gush into your shoe with your wet sock.  Yes, I do.  You watch the fungus sock.  What I do is I always shower in my socks and in my underpants. 
[01:01:00]  And then I just put my clothing back on with those things soggy.  I like a good soggy sock.  A lady likes a man with a soggy pair of socks on.  All right.  You shower.  You put the dry socks on.  You go back into the bathroom and you soak in a little water.  That sucks.  Change the socks or no?  Immediately.  I despise wet feet.  That sucks.  It depends how much water I soak in.  Yeah, how much.  If it's a little bit, you could just kind of dry it off.  Yeah.  All right.  If it's a little lot, you're screwed. 
[01:01:30]  Here's the final card.  It's purple.  Purple.  All right.  Let me think.  Talk about a C word.  No way.  What?  Is that what it's?  The first thing is talk about a C word.  You have Alzheimer's.  We did this bit.  Dude, I have no recollection of talk about a C word.  I remember the other ones.  Why didn't we just get new cards for the bit?  Which one was this?  Because they don't really have.  They don't have any new ones.  These are the ones.  Yeah.  Talk about a C word. 
[01:02:00]  And these are real Hallmark cards, by the way.  This is not a morning show bit.  I think I know what the C word is.  Talk about a C word.  And you could even go to their website and check it out for yourself.  Wait.  Let me guess.  What?  Talk about the C word.  Happy anniversary, honey.  You are one.  And I hope you get it.  They're just taking the wrong approach with this card.  Because it says, talk about a C word.  Crummy comes to mind.  When you think C word, the word crummy comes to mind?  No.  Not even when I'm eating a bun. 
[01:02:30]  Talk about the N word.  That's what it would be.  That's what it's like.  Right.  It's like, talk about the N word.  Nitpicky.  It's not that.  Right.  People hear C word, they think one thing.  Well, crummy.  N word.  Crummy comes to mind.  Crummy.  Wish you weren't feeling that way.  Yes.  But some good words start with C, like?  No.  Canarsie. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  I'm sorry you have canarsie.  Wait, good words start with C.  Good words that start with C.  Yeah.  Like?  Cat.  Don't you dare.  By the way.  Don't you dare.  Club Soda Kenny?  You don't have to tease me.  I was just going to say the Jack Jack.  What's Jack Jack?  He's my cat. 
[01:03:30]  Well, trivia.  Where'd you get your cat?  You bought it?  You from the little shelter?  No.  Another guess?  No.  Steve.  Enough about the cat.  Basel.  Give me the cat.  I like turtles.  There you go.  Don't chase me, bro.  There you go. 
[01:04:00]  You're a good C word.  Someone is suggesting Chiasano.  This is C.  I didn't even think of this.  Yes.  Yes.  Good words start with C.  Like courage.  You have lots of that.  Oh, okay.  Comfort.  Mm-hmm.  Creep.  You're wished a bunch.  And caring.  Mm-hmm.  You're surrounded by it.  A cancer card, everybody.  Is that what it was? 
[01:04:30]  Here's another.  Now get in your car.  Because you're bumming us out.  Go sleep out.  Go sleep on the cot.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really. 
[01:05:00]  You know, when you think about it.  But starting today, the Today Show, they've hosed down the set.  And, you know, there's going to be no mention of Katie Kerr.  Hosed it down.  She is now gone.  Persona non grata.  She will never be seen there again.  Never be referred to.  And that's it.  They got a new person in there.  They've been in 1977.  They've been doing that since 1977.  And look how quickly it ends.  They have that three-hour sap fest yesterday.  And then, like we say, when someone gets killed at Disney, they just hose it down. 
[01:05:30]  Put the little Mickey up for a little while.  Under maintenance.  Come back later.  They hose it down.  And then, with nary an investigation, open the gates and let the people back in.  How many people have to die on that mission space thing?  Before they close that ride down.  Some worker just humming as he's, you know, mopping up blood.  Whistle while you work.  Whistle while you work.  And just like buckets of blood and brain matter are coming up. 
[01:06:00]  One of my favorite Disney deaths.  There's a whole website dedicated to Disney deaths.  And they really don't make the news as big as they should.  They report them.  But, like we say, they just hose it down and get the rides running again.  We've got to keep this going.  We can't make it look bad.  One of my favorites was Disneyland.  They have that big ship, the Columbia, that goes around with the Mark Twain steam paddle wheel ship. 
[01:06:30]  I was on that, by the way.  Everyone was on it at some point.  It's a fun little ride around Tom Sawyer Island.  I love Disney.  Most of the Disney rides stink.  I love Disney.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  Look, he's moving and he looks like a robot.  They need to update those damn rides.  It's the happiest place on earth.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  That's what they call it.  What's the one where you, 10,000 leagues under the sea, you, they closed out years ago. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  But, yeah, it's been a while since I've been down there.  And we are now, oh, Jesus.  And they make it sound like you're very, very, very deep into the ocean.  We are now going beneath the Arctic ice caps.  Dive, dive, dive.  You look up, you see people waiting online for the autotopia.  You can see, like, the surface of the water is two feet above your window.  Yeah, you look up and all you see is fat calves.  Sir, there's an octopus off the starboard side. 
[01:07:30]  Ooh, let me look.  And it's some goofy plastic octopus.  And you see the strings holding the fish up.  No, it's just some bratty kid screaming, yelling,  Mommy, Mommy, I want a Mickey Mouse ice cream down.  It's like, why are we on an Atomic Sub with children with mouse ears on?  This is totally ruining the illusion.  Maybe they've been caught up in some kind of a nuclear spill,  and they're kind of retarded.  That could be.  And they're white children with black ears.  What was the...  They've updated some of the rights.  They took that out.  What was the dumb attraction where they were talking about the future, 
[01:08:00]  and it's the future if it was 1970, maybe?  Brought to you by Monsanto, where we will shrink you.  Remember that one?  They shrunk you down.  You are now the size of a molecule.  Look at what's got...  Sponsored by AT&T.  What's Monsanto?  Monsanto is something from, like, years ago.  I don't even know.  Is it still there?  But I remember going in through the ride, and they would shrink you down.  Do you?  And it was sponsored by Monsanto. 
[01:08:30]  Monsanto.  That's Whoopi's co-host.  Great.  What did you say, Eric?  What is this?  It's the Carousel of Progress.  No, no, no.  It was the one where they shrink you down.  It was called...  The Carousel of Progress, by the way, another death in the Carousel of Progress.  There was something called America Sings, and that's what they turned the Carousel of Progress into.  And what would happen is you'd sit in a stage, and it was in the round.  And you would sit around a stage, and instead of people changing the stage, the whole audience would rotate to another portion of the stage. 
[01:09:00]  So, I guess a quarter of the audience is seeing something different every time as they rotate.  Well, a poor girl worker got in between some of the gear workings of the stage and was crushed to death.  Please tell me she was beheaded.  She was just completely, like, corrugated through some gear work.  What year was that?  That was probably 75, around 75. 
[01:09:30]  It was a while ago.  But how did you remember it was sponsored by...  Because they pushed these things...  What was it, Mons...  Monsanto.  Monsanto.  It was like you went into a microscope, and you slowly got smaller and smaller to show you, like, what happened on, like, small things, like Paramecium.  Someone's saying it was called Body Wars?  No, that's something different.  That was a newer thing.  I'm talking old school.  I'm talking early 70s.  How many times did you go there as a kid? 
[01:10:00]  I've been to Disneyland probably 25 times.  Ugh, what a queer...  Well, I used to live out there when I was a kid.  I agree with Jimmy.  We're shock jocks.  I was a kid out there.  We're shock jocks.  You can't be admitting that you went to Disney.  Dude, you went on field trips to Disney in school when you lived out.  I lived in the O.C.  You know what?  I went once.  Me too.  I went once and said, this stinks, this is overrated, and I'll never come back. 
[01:10:30]  When was the last time you were at Disney?  I was there.  Tell him.  Tell Jimmy.  Tell him.  I went to Disney World in Florida under a year ago.  He goes all the time.  It's nice.  It's not just the Magic Kingdom, my friend.  It is Epcot.  It is the water parks.  It's wonderful.  Anthony's trying to relive his childhood.  I enjoy Disney.  Not that pesky babysitter.  He missed out on a normal childhood, so he's trying to recapture it at Disney.  Epcot has all the lands. 
[01:11:00]  You can go to Japan and Mexico, and then you have dinner there, and you see their little  attraction.  It tells you a little bit about, like, Norway, and you go in, you take this little ride,  and it'll tell you, you know, Norway is known for its fishing.  And you're sitting in a boat, and you go, ooh, and they got a, you know, a guy, a little  robot guy, and he's fishing.  Is he?  Here's what you do when he goes to Stone for Fishing.  Is it? 
[01:11:30]  Ugh.  Next stupid country.  No.  And then you go to another country.  I bet you Anthony has a big smile on his face, maybe a couple tears, because he's just so  emotional.  I'm so happy.  He gets into it.  And you go to the little England part of Epcot, and you could have yourself some beer.  You sit there and drink.  You could do a little drinking game.  Not real beer, though.  No.  That at Epcot, you can drink.  And a fun thing to play is the drinking game, where you try to go from England all the  way to Mexico and drink at every single country. 
[01:12:00]  See, now that's cool.  And you are hammered by the time you make it to, like, Africa.  You're done.  Yeah.  You're done.  That's right.  That's a fun game to play.  Yeah, it sounds terrific.  If I want to cry, I'll watch Brian's song, and then look on the net about these other stupid  third world dumps.  It's fun.  It's not fun.  So where were we?  We were talking about the deaths, some of the deaths, and how they hose it down.  The Columbia would come in, and it's on a track, because perish the thought, anything 
[01:12:30]  works independently there at Disney.  So it's on a track, but it actually has a motor.  So somebody has to work the speed, but they don't have to steer the ship.  When it comes into dock, somebody's got to, like, cut back on the engine, and a couple  of workers take the big ropes, throw it around the cleats, and the boat stops.  Well, they were going a little too fast.  I think someone was kind of new.  And there was a poor Asian couple, probably spent every yen that they had to get from  Japan to America to go to Disney. 
[01:13:00]  When was this, by the way?  When was this?  This was about four years, five years ago.  And the boat came in.  They threw the rope on the cleat.  These Asian people are waiting on line.  The cleat rips out of the dock, because the boat's going too fast, and whips the guy in  the head.  He's hit with a spring-loaded rope cleat from a ship.  And it just takes his head clean off.  Took his head clean off. 
[01:13:30]  Decapitated him?  Decapitated.  You sure he got decapitated?  I don't remember that part of it.  Yeah, took his head right off.  Yeah, all right.  Was his wife upset?  A little bit upset.  A little bit.  Imagine you're on line for a ride.  The next thing you know, your spouse's skull is in front of you.  You know what they do, though?  They give you a...  Put ears on it?  I believe they let her go to the front of any line she wanted to.  Space Mountain, right to the front, Mrs. Wang.  Your husband's head.  I'm sure they mailed her a VIP pass. 
[01:14:00]  Be waiting for you at the exit gate.  You see, very few people on the park actually have the little gold wristband.  That means a spouse or a loved one has been decapitated, and then there's the asterisk,  while in line.  Yes.  But again...  No more lines for you.  They just hose it down and start it back up again.  How does she not own Disney World?  They have some lawyers, is what it is.  They must pay a fortune when people get injured there.  It all depends on where you're from.  There's a lot of... 
[01:14:30]  Vietnam, 200 bucks.  Yeah.  A lot of money there.  There's a lot of rumors there, too, though.  They say nobody's ever been pronounced dead at Disney because they won't allow it.  Well, they dragged the body off the site.  They dragged the body off site so that no one can actually be pronounced dead at Disney.  How great is that?  That's a rumor.  You think they have, like, Mickey Mouse and Goofy just dragging the bodies off site?  Let's pull them off of here.  Okay.  You grab the arms.  I'll grab the head.  I'll turn them upside down.  There's spinal fluid leaking all over the floor. 
[01:15:00]  Get the hose.  And the wacky, like, Keystone Cop version of the fire department comes over and sprays the blood down.  Oh, they can't control the hose.  People are laughing.  The electrical parade comes through and blood on the tire tracks.  Wow.  It's wonderful.  I love Disney.  It's a magical place.  And then the people mover was another death.  They have a lot of high schools that would take their prom field trips there.  And the guy got a little overzealous, and one of the cars wanted to be with some of his friends. 
[01:15:30]  And the people mover moves at about one half a mile an hour.  It's the slowest ride ever.  What it is is a ride you go on when the lines are too long for everything else in Tomorrowland because it kind of takes you through the other rides.  So you get a glimpse of what's going on in the other rides.  So he was alone in one of the cars and wanted to get with one of his friends.  Sure.  And they're like pods on these electric tracks.  And as he's climbing over, he fell between the two cars. 
[01:16:00]  And, of course, the Disney death, he was crushed because a lot of crushing deaths at Disney.  It's never like, what happened here?  You never have time to really go, I think I'm injured and I'm going to die.  It's a very instant, fun, happiest place on earth, crushing death.  You get it, Disney.  A lot of picking hair out of gear.  Out of machinery.  People are saying that that guy wasn't decapitated.  You can read it on Snopes.com.  You can read about Disney deaths at Snopes.com. 
[01:16:30]  I heard when that cleat hit him in the head that his head came off.  That's my information, my friend.  Either way, he was in bad shape.  Yeah, please.  B-Bear from Boston.  I bet Anthony keeps a little notebook while at Epcot, writing down pertinent facts about each country.  Yeah.  I did a Canada?  What year was that?  They do have all the other ones.  And a lot of people want to know how long you spent that Nazi Germany while in Epcot.  Exactly.  We're closing the park, sir. 
[01:17:00]  I just want to try on one more uniform, sir.  Sir.  They do have Germany.  They do have the German pavilion, Germany pavilion at Epcot.  But they really steer clear of the roaring 40s.  The late 30s and 40s really aren't represented at Disney like they should.  They go from 1939 to 1950.  It's like 1933, and then they go up to about the 50s, yeah, in Germany, skipping anything involving the war years. 
[01:17:30]  They had to ask Anthony to leave Poland because he kept trying to shoo everybody out of it.  Trying to start up a little ghetto.  Could you eat your knockwurst in here, please?  What?  No, no, just come with me.  They do a wonderful Oktoberfest thing at the German pavilion every day.  Germany stinks.  They spell Oktober with a K.  It's a creepy place.  It's fun.  It's frightening and intimidating to people to have a K.  It's Oktober every day in Disney.  It's Oktoberfest like that. 
[01:18:00]  And then every night at Epcot, the fireworks display and the big globe that comes out.  It's a wonderful, wonderful, happy place.  I went once with a girl when I was maybe 21 or whatever.  My girlfriend at the time wanted to go, and I met her and her father down there.  Now where at Disney World?  Florida.  Florida.  Okay.  Branniff Airlines.  And stupid whore.  She lost my Lakers jersey.  She's like, I don't know what happened to it.  She took it to the pool and left it there.  She probably slept with somebody.  She cheated on me a lot.  Dirty girl.  Some Mexican probably left two generations all over my stupid Lakers jersey. 
[01:18:30]  That's when you were dressing ghetto, right?  No, no, no, no.  This is when I was...  You weren't a Lakers fan, were you?  Yes.  I loved James Worthy.  He got busted with a hooker in Seattle.  I loved the old Lakers.  Of course you'd love him then.  Worthy was amazing.  Of course.  Speaking of my white black guy days, I had a memory last night and I got oof.  Can we tease that?  Because we're really late.  I do show.  We're really late.  We are just three very different people. 
[01:19:00]  I enjoy things like that and you enjoy your, you know, hookers and things like that.  You enjoy Disney.  I enjoy hookers.  Do you think we're different?  Because you have more polar opposite things?  I love God and wholesome things.  Well, you know, you kill children and you like prostitutes.  Jeremy, really fast because we've got to take a break here.  Just so you know, there's a book called Tragic Kingdom.  Details all that stuff Anthony's talking about plus the pedophile cover-ups.  Really?  Oh, really?  A little ped cover-ups.  And it's called Tragic Kingdom? 
[01:19:30]  Tragic Kingdom.  Sounds like a good read.  Yeah, there was a drowning too of a couple of kids that tried to swim from Tom Sawyer Island.  They hung out, waited until the park closed, hiding, and then they tried to swim to Tom Sawyer Island  across the little thing and I guess they were drunk and one of them drowned.  I remember one time Otto and George, who was great yesterday, was doing some,  it was right after those two kids were killed when they went inside the polar bear cage.  Oh, yeah.  Otto's on stage.  I think I just blew the joke, but I didn't care because at the time and the puppet,  he goes, I like your outfit, George. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I found these clothes outside the polar bear cage, which would have been much funnier  if I didn't say polar bear cage.  But I had to make a time reference because back then everybody got it.  If I just would have said that, you would have went, when did that happen?  Yeah, when did that happen?  I probably should have.  Otto had one of the greatest lines yesterday.  Can you redo it, please?  Otto and George were on the show yesterday and after we ended this part of the show,  well, of course, we continue on XM and we did the walk to the XM studio live on the air for XM, right?  And we just mocked people on the street.  And unfortunately for us and this woman, we saw a woman with one arm. 
[01:20:30]  No, she had a half, she had like one arm and then the other arm was like stopped like maybe three inches below the elbow.  Yeah, and she had a stump just kind of hanging out under a short sleeve little blouse.  Oh, yeah, it was above the elbow, I'm sorry.  We're hanging out outside this place, outside of XM, because Oprah's obsessed with just making fun of her to her face.  And we're like, look, let's just go in, this could be a problem.  And when she came out with the little stump arm, Otto went, how'd she get that hailing a helicopter? 
[01:21:00]  I don't want George bananas this weekend in New Jersey.  Yeah, Hasbro Heights, bananas, Roddy and Saturday, without Owen George.  I lived all night.  Really, so did I actually.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the worst of Oprah in the end of the day.  I read Tuesdays with Maury, whatever, I can admit it on the air.  Is that on Oprah's list?  It's one of Oprah's books from her book club.  Fang.  You know what?  It's a fang. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Consulting Oprah's book list from books?  I didn't, wait, wait, now you guys, see, now I'm screwed for an hour.  I'm quitting.  I'm not going to go through this.  You're quitting.  I'm not going through this today.  Oh, my God.  No, I did not know it was.  You are gay.  I didn't know it was a book on Oprah's book club.  Oh, so you didn't go to see what the next book on Oprah's list was.  No, I did not know.  Get that one.  Okay.  All right.  I'll give it to you.  Tuesdays with Maury, Anthony.  What is that about? 
[01:22:00]  About a professor who's dying and one of his ex-students, who's that famous guy that is  part of Sports Illustrated and ESPN and all that, sports writer, goes back to see his  old professor while he's dying and writes a book about it.  And then there's like some life lessons from Maury, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  How to live life to the fullest.  Oh, man. 
[01:22:30]  God.  It's a quick.  Does your penis just yell at you as you're reading it?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  It's a quick.  Put that down.  It's a quick read, Ant.  One of those quick reads.  A quick read?  Quick read.  Ant.  See, you don't take the train.  You'll read anything.  I don't know.  I can think of a lot of.  You will read anything on the goddamn train.  I can think of a lot of other books.  How about a nap?  I think Stephen King's got a new book out.  You know?  That's a nice, thick book.  You can pick that up and read through that one.  Stephen King, he's lost it a little bit, Anthony. 
[01:23:00]  His books aren't.  I was hit by a van.  What do you want?  You know.  Jesus.  Even kind of half-assed Stephen King is better than Maury's.  What?  Brian's song?  What are you reading?  Ice Castle.  What was that movie that just came out, too, with Richard Gere?  Did you see that?  No, I did not see.  About the girl that's dying.  I did not see Autumn in New York.  Autumn in New York?  No.  No, I did not see that.  I hear when you walk into the theater, they have a place where you check your penis and testicles. 
[01:23:30]  You check them.  Like in the Old West, you had to check your guns before you went into the saloon.  You check your genitalia.  You see the movie as a chick.  And then you can pick up your genitals as you leave the theater.  You're just not in touch with your sensitive side, Anthony.  That's really getting in touch, though.  A book like that.  Yeah, I'm a fag.  Have you been weepy about the book?  I want to know.  I'm really getting into your psyche here.  When you read the book and one of these touching moments come up, do you get all misty or something? 
[01:24:00]  No, not at all, right?  Do you go, oh, no, it reminds me of an old professor I had.  That was pretty cool.  Oh, okay.  Is he dead?  Yeah, he is dead, actually.  All right, maybe, okay, now you can relate.  I don't know.  It's a good book.  All right.  Say what you want.  It was a pretty good book.  Oh, look, I'm getting pounded.  All right.  I'm getting pounded.  You know my sister works at Blockbuster, right?  Yeah.  She told me to get to you and have the fried green tomatoes return because there's a late fee on that.  And Sophie's Choice.  Shut up, you ass. 
[01:24:30]  Make sure you read the next Oprah classic, The Man with the Guilish Smile from Jonathan in Jersey.  Sophie, can you give us a review of the new Daniel Steele novel?  Come on.  I don't feel like going through this today.  It doesn't matter if you feel like it.  You're putting yourself out there.  You're putting yourself out there.  Doug, what's going on?  First, Gina Davis is ugly.  What time is your manicure appointment?  I don't know what it will be. 
[01:25:00]  I didn't say Gina Davis.  Excuse me.  Do you sit down when you wait?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  First of all, I didn't say Gina Davis was hot.  Well, how could you?  I just saw her in the paper.  How could you have anything bad to say about that picture?  Seriously now.  About Gina Davis?  Yeah.  She's disgusting.  She's disgusting.  I'm sure Mark was better looking, right?  Yeah, exactly.  You got me, Doug.  Anything else?  That's it.  Okay.  Homo.  Pretty good job, though.  One more thing.  Homo.  We know how this is going to end.  We know how this plays out. 
[01:25:30]  This old gag.  Opie, I hear Beaches is out on DVD.  With interviews and everything.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, Anthony, did you hear Opie trying to make it better with the Sports Illustrated guy?  You're trying to make it better with the Sports Illustrated guy?  Yes, Sports Illustrated.  Sports Illustrated.  Oh, what are you doing?  The guy from ESPN.  All right, dude, I'm going to send you waiting for exhale.  All right, thank you. 
[01:26:00]  That is your name.  Hey.  I mean, I...  Wait a second.  Let me ask you a question.  You tell me you didn't read American Psycho, but you read Tuesdays with Maury?  But American Psycho is on my reading list.  After you guys talked highly about it.  Right.  After Fried Green Tomatoes.  Oh, I mean, Stella gets her groove on.  Shut up. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, Opie got his groove back.  All right, Opie, go look for your groove there, Mary.  Bye.  Mary.  I read everything, Anthony.  Everything.  God damn.  I'm running out of books to read.  How was Beaches?  Beaches.  That's great.  Who wrote Tuesdays with Maury?  Sebastian Bach.  Can we set a time limit today?  Opie, what's on Lifetime tonight?  Oh, anything?  A movie starring Marky Post. 
[01:27:00]  In a role that you've never seen her in before.  What's the matter, Opie?  Was memoirs of a geisha sold out of Barnes & Noble?  Opie, were you at Broadway on Broadway yesterday?  Bridges in Madison County.  Opie did see that in the movies, by the way.  Did I?  Yeah, I remember you were in hell.  But you were doing it as like one of those favor things that you have to do.  No, I did admit we went and saw that.  No, I remember.  I was screaming at the screen. 
[01:27:30]  And I was looking at another guy next to me with his arms folded, pissed off, because his lady dragged him to it as well.  Bridges in Madison County.  As what's-her-name is at the window massaging her breasts.  What's-her-name?  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood.  No, Meryl Streep is at the window as Clint is washing himself in the makeshift shower outside with his saggy old skin.  Oh, his skin is hanging off of him like a doily.  And she's getting all turned on from the window.  Oh, God. 
[01:28:00]  What a mess.  Like drapes.  What a mess.  Ugh.  His sack's hitting the ground.  Skin looks like an elephant's ass.  I was at a zoo recently.  Good reference, right?  Thanks.  So you were going to tell us how cats was the last-  Shut up!  Come on!  Ah, yeah.  How does the Liberace biographed that new cats? 
[01:28:30]  Hey, precious, did you catch Sleepless in Seattle on TV this weekend?  How was the final showing of cats?  Ugh.  Christ.  When are you scheduled on The View?  See, now that's funny.  And time.  There we go.  I made it?  You made it.  Bravo.  Good job.  That old gag.  I like how you said, I don't want to do this today.  It's not the choice of the guy that's in the barrel. 
[01:29:00]  Is that up to you?  Now someone's calling us the Oprah and Anthony show.  There you go.  Can we play what's in Opie's pants?  Punch out, Maverick.  Give me something to give away, then they can't call about this.  All right.  Opie's giving away copies of the Joy Luck Club.  This is how messed up my life is.  Yeah.  Last week, I did read Tuesday with Maury on the train.  Yeah.  Long Island Railroad.  I'll admit it.  And then the next day, I was riding home listening to Andrew Dice Clay's latest CD. 
[01:29:30]  There you go.  You're multifaceted.  Oh, face down, ass up.  The dirtiest comedy.  That's a joke there.  Oh.  Shut up.  Talking about the CD or your weekend.  Shut up.  Yeah, whatever, man.  Come on.  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ. 
[01:30:00]  WXRK New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're in the middle of this fat Nick story, if you don't mind.  Yeah, yeah, go for it.  So, you know, just bring on the funny when you feel like it.  Or if you want to be serious with it, too, that's fine.  We don't care.  Right?  Whatever makes you happy.  Whatever makes you happy, right.  Never works.  We have the 911 call, I guess. 
[01:30:30]  Yes, where were we at?  Well, where were we?  We were Fat Nick, hate crime, hit him over the head with a bat.  We were laughing at some of the details of the story.  Best line ever.  That were in the newspaper today.  Apparently, Fat Nick and his buddy robbed the black guy.  Afterwards.  Oh, no.  Like, took some of his stuff.  It was kind of a counter.  You know when you sue and then there's a counter suit?  This guy was trying to rob and then they counter robbed him after they hit him with the bat. 
[01:31:00]  I like to call it Even Steven.  Even Steven.  It's the old Even Steven game.  I think it's a little bit of degradation and a little bit of you're not getting out of the neighborhood that easy without your shoes.  And we don't know what's in this bag, so we'll just take it kind of a thing.  But, Jimmy, describe some of the contents of the black gentleman's bag that was beaten.  Oh, what a lovely chuckle I had at this.  After they smashed his head with a bat, they left with his shoes and a bag containing items he wore days earlier to try out for the Family Feud. 
[01:31:30]  How perfect is that?  A bag full of Family Feud items and you get smashed with an aluminum bat.  This guy.  As you should be.  That was out trying to rob cars.  Thought he'd make his fortune on Family Feud.  What do you need for a Family Feud audition?  A stool and a rope?  A whiskey bottle and a hating father and an enabling mother. 
[01:32:00]  Hi, welcome to the Family Feud.  Louie Anderson here.  And, God, I could be more suicidal.  I've got to actually plaster a smile on my face because my whole life has just been tragedy.  But I've turned that around to comedy.  That's my whole act.  I've turned tragedy to comedy.  Somehow, during the translation on stage, it turns right back to tragedy again because there's not one thing laugh in the whole thing. 
[01:32:30]  My father used to beat me with whiskey bottles because he thought I was gay.  Thank you.  I am.  And I tried losing weight because the kids at school would call me fat.  And my mother just kept shoving ho-hos and Twinkies down my throat, the enabling bitch.  And that's what turned out this unfunny, Jabba the Hutt-looking mess. 
[01:33:00]  Let's bring on the Negro family from Howard Beach.  Why are you nude?  Did someone steal your clothes?  Were they what?  They're all posed.  You know, he's laying there with his hands up in the air and he'd, don't strike me.  With a bandage on his feet.  Show me head trauma.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  Top ten answers on the board to this question. 
[01:33:30]  Where shouldn't a n*** be after midnight?  Harlem?  No, I'm sorry.  Howard Beach?  That's correct.  Howard Beach is the number one answer on the board.  Sorry to use the salty language, people.  I'm trying to make a point.  And I use cactus like Miss Diamonds. 
[01:34:00]  Family.  Boy, that poor guy.  See, he probably was strapped for bucks.  Top ten things a baseball bat is used for.  I'm going to say a hat.  It's a measuring device.  How do we bring...  A baseball bat and a half tall.  Why do we bring them up?  We tried to measure it for the description for the police.  Yes, the officer. 
[01:34:30]  He was dark colored and a baseball bat and a half high.  Let's get the Fat Nick family up here to the buzzer and the black family.  Come on up here.  Come on up to the buzzer.  Now, Fat Nick, you can leave the bat back there.  Hit the buzzer with your hands.  You don't need the bat.  What is it?  Oh, he just hit the black gentleman over the head.  He gets you on a player pass.  One of your family members are unconscious.  Oh, look. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, the Fat Nick family didn't get it, so the black family has a chance to steal.  Well, you know what's going to happen next.  Food.  All right.  Fat Nick family.  Top three answers on the board to this question.  Give me another name for eggplant.  Eggplant.  Moulin-yan.  Moulin-yan. 
[01:35:30]  Jig-a-boo.  No, that's not an eggplant, sir.  Wow.  Chester's liver from the instant feedback.  The funniest thing about Louie Anderson is that he is the only gay guy in America that has a problem losing weight.  Oh, jeez.  That's a little harsh.  All right, so we got the Fat Nick victim testifying.  He testified yesterday, and that's why all this fun today, I guess.  Testified, huh?  One of the big stories in the papers here in New York City. 
[01:36:00]  He was really trying to scrape up some cash.  Oh, what an ass.  All right, here's...  His name doesn't do him any favors, does it?  I mean, if he was Intelligent Bob, there would be a different outcome, wouldn't he?  My client, Intelligent Bob.  Right.  Philosophical Charles.  Thoughtful Steve never would have done this.  That's right.  Deep and meaningful Harry.  Would never have done a thing like this. 
[01:36:30]  The Fat Nick kind of dumps you.  Yeah, it really does start you off on the wrong foot.  The wrong fat foot.  Yeah, how do you defend Fat Nick?  Because you know that Polly Walnuts isn't going to be your doctor, right?  Yeah, right.  It does dump you, I think.  My client, Jew-hater Frank, is misunderstood.  He's misunderstood.  Fascist Fred.  Incompetent Eric.  I'm sorry. 
[01:37:00]  Incompetent Charles.  That is really good.  All right, well, here's a brief 911 clip, okay?  Well, Nicholas Minucci sat and listened as the victim in this case,  Glenn Moore took the witness stand and described for jurors in vivid detail  how he says he was assaulted last summer.  He says Nick Minucci came at him with an aluminum bat  and pointed his head to the baseball.  Glenn Moore came to court to tell his side of the story, 
[01:37:30]  how he walked into Howard Beach with two friends late one night last June  and ended up running for his life.  Caught, he says, by defendant Nick Minucci  and savagely beaten with an aluminum bat.  Moore's 911 call played for jurors today.  I just got hit in my head with a bat.  Hold on one second.  I just got hit in the head with a bat.  Uh-oh. 
[01:38:00]  And then what?  Oh, he said hold on one second.  He's hitting me again.  Hold on.  I just got hit in the head with a bat.  That's like, yeah.  He's hitting me again.  I'm going to run out of any time minutes.  By the way, some dude from a mobile device, you dated dopes.  Louie Anderson doesn't do the feud anymore.  Quit the annoying voice already, please.  If you don't find that funny, really, go away.  Yeah, just go away.  We don't want you to listen.  Just drink a bottle of whiskey.  Go away, you dope.  Get in your car and hit a pole. 
[01:38:30]  We don't want you to listen.  Why are you listening?  Yeah, go away.  And then he, like, has to sit there and text 203-376.  He has to sit there and text it from his mobile phone.  He has to, like, type in.  Oh, I gave the wrong one out.  Oh, well.  Call him with a compliment.  I hate when they scroll too quickly for me. 
[01:39:00]  Louie Anderson.  Just sold someone down the river, some innocent person.  You really did.  Good.  He actually loves to show that guy.  All right.  So, here's the next clip.  Nick's lawyer speaks.  Yes.  Fat Nick's lawyer speaks here, Billy.  Billy Connolly, everyone.  Let me hear this.  Minucci's lawyer questioning Moore today and calling his entire story a fairy tale.  Do you believe that fairy tale that he was walking through Howard Beach at 3.30 in the morning to look at houses?  Come on.  Get real. 
[01:39:30]  Prosecutors call the beating a hate crime.  Moore chased and beaten, they say, for being black in a white neighborhood.  Minucci even taunting Moore with racial epithets.  But Minucci's lawyer says Moore was only targeted because he intended to steal a car that night.  And about the epithets, well, he says they were fueled not by hate, but simply a sign of the times.  It's street talk.  Don't you understand?  If you listen to hip-hop, if you listen to these people when they sing, when they speak, and when they dance, look at the videos and see what happens. 
[01:40:00]  That's the language.  It's the language of the street.  Defense lawyers will make that argument to jurors when they begin their case later on.  There is, of course, good reason to try and eliminate bias as a motive for the assault.  Even if Nick Minucci were convicted on assault without racial motivation, the penalties would be far less severe.  It seems like more white kids are using that word, by the way.  Of course.  It's more severe. 
[01:40:30]  I was at the beach over the weekend, Robert Moses, as white as you could get.  And, man, it was all like, you know, kids with the hip-hop styles, and they're all using the word like it's nothing, like it's high.  Whitey's using it a lot.  Whitey's using it a lot.  A lot these days.  I like the way the lawyers said these people when they sing and when they dance.  These people when they sing and dance.  And when they're doing that car-stealing walk in the morning.  You know, when I used to watch Al Jolson.  That's how they dance.  How they did.  Those people. 
[01:41:00]  I should have maybe come up with a different way to put that.  Those people.  Those people.  He doesn't cut it for me.  Those people.  These people when they eat their stolen fried food.  Jesus.  Relax.  If I may say on behalf of obese Nicholas.  Yeah.  Compulsive overeater Nicholas.  Fiddy.  Fiddy Nicholas.  Hey, by the way, Bird in Philly is helping us out with the Louie Anderson thing.  Yeah.  He writes, hey, other ass.  There's nothing funny about Richard Karn. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I was trying to remember the guy's name who does it now.  Yeah, Richard Karn does it from Tool Time.  Oh, yeah.  From Home Improvement.  Home Improvement.  It's a non-entity.  I forgot his name.  It's not a personality that's like Louie Anderson.  Come on.  We have even done Richard Dawson.  Yeah, that bit would be just as funny imitating Richard Karn.  That's a fatso.  He looks like one of those homoerotic male nurses with an awful beard.  He's smothering an old person.  That they do best. 
[01:42:00]  You male nurses, you got a bad rap.  They certainly do.  So many of them just love walking out of the room with the old lady and her twisted nose  because the pillow is...  How did grandma's nose get twisted?  Her shoes all fall off as her shake.  And weird stuff in a blender.  There's blue eye shadow on her pillow.  He's got a needle full of succinylcholine.  She needs to sleep forever.  She's in pain.  What are you talking about?  I'm helping.  I'm the angel of death. 
[01:42:30]  That's right.  Into the arms of Morpheus we go.  He just whispers sweet nothings as he leans over and gives her a good Chief Nicholson type of a nap.  Throw a sting through the window.  Fatso.  Male nurses, man.  Big creepy fatso with white shoes.  Reading your chart, a doctor has subscribed to pillow.  They subscribed to pillow?  Oh, prescribed to...  Did they want 13 a year?  I stink. 
[01:43:00]  Someone is suggesting the guy that didn't like the Family Feud thing should do his impression of Ray Combs.  One of the hosts of Family Feud.  That was a tragic end, huh?  He hung himself.  He was a comic, too.  He did.  Yeah, he hung himself.  In a closet or something.  He was the guy right after Richard Dawson, I guess.  Right.  When they brought the feud back.  Yeah, and then he hung himself.  A little short guy.  After his run at the... 
[01:43:30]  Well, maybe it was over a relationship.  I don't know what it was over, but he...  Well, did you do it on the shore?  Did you do it live on the air?  Survey said.  Oh, that is quite a statement when you hang yourself to kill yourself because you know  you're being found like that.  The worst is guys who hang themselves from something in the ceiling, but their legs are  just bent on the floor.  It's like they were actually hanging and they could have stood up because their feet are  touching the floor and they just continue to stay like that until they're dead.  Just kept the knees bent?  Yeah.  I mean, that's a commitment to kill yourself. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think you get many of them.  Not a lot, no.  I think what you find is most people, they find their fingernails on the rope, you know,  as they change their mind.  John, this was a bad idea, right?  What was I thinking?  But they can't get it off their neck?  Yeah.  No, you're making it impossible to get it off your neck.  Can't you pull the rope above you?  Like, there's a rope above you.  Can't you pull it and loosen some of the slack?  Dude, I could choke you out in two seconds.  That's unbelievably difficult to do. 
[01:44:30]  You got no energy when you're being choked.  The blood is, you're losing blood to your head.  You're just done.  You're not thinking, I'll climb up, I'll get this.  It's a MacGyver.  Why don't we try it?  I've done that many times and I laugh about it.  One time I almost hung myself by accident.  It was an auto asphyxiation.  No, you didn't.  Yeah.  I had a belt around my neck in a closet.  I was holding a pornographic.  No, of course not.  Of course not with you.  Well, you really got to take a break.  Why do the guys who do that have an orange in their mouth?  Do they?  They often have an orange in their mouth. 
[01:45:00]  A piece of fruit?  Is it an ecstasy thing?  Because ecstasy people like really weird stuff.  I don't know.  Maybe they're doing their godfather impression.  Stop, you're spilling it.  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, what's up?  Travis.  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering if you guys were talking about that Geno's situation down in Philly 
[01:45:30]  where they won't serve you unless you order in English.  I just heard this.  Ben, you got the story?  We love Philly.  We love WISP.  We love being back on in Philly.  We love the fact that we're bringing the traveling virus comedy tour thing to Canada, New Jersey  at the Tweeter Center, September 9th.  Here's the story.  Big Spanish.  An English-only ordering policy at one of the city's most famous cheese steak joints could lead to a formal discrimination complaint.  Why?  The city commission on human relations plan to argue that the policy at Geno's steaks discourages customers of certain backgrounds from eating there. 
[01:46:00]  It said Rachel Lawton, acting executive director.  Geno's owner, Joseph Vento, posted two small signs at a South Philadelphia shop proclaiming,  This is America, when ordering, please speak English.  That's not asking a lot.  And it's polite.  Please speak English.  That's not asking a lot.  Nope.  That's accurate.  And the sign basically says you can still speak another language. 
[01:46:30]  He just wishes that you would speak English.  Please speak English.  You ever go to that joint?  There's a line 24 hours a day, basically.  But it's amazing.  Like, something that innocuous, it's amazing how society reacts to that.  Like, you know, meanwhile, I mean, the Puerto Rican Day Parade or any other parade where there's all this other ethnic pride  and all this other pride over Mexico and Puerto Rico and flags being flown, we have all this pride for our country.  That's acceptable and fine.  But if you say this is America, I have pride.  Please order in English. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, now you're stepping on other people's toes.  Can we stop being so condescending and guilt-ridden, man?  God bless this guy.  And why isn't he on our show?  We're huge in Philly.  Yeah, let's get him.  WISP is pushing this show like crazy.  They're doing another WOW sticker stop today.  And this guy, his quote is great, the owner of Geno's.  I would say they would have to handcuff me and take me out because I'm not taking the sign down.  Please support this guy.  The cheesesteaks are supposed to be amazing anyway.  It's supposed to be? 
[01:47:30]  It's legendary.  Yeah.  Is that the place on, I want to say South Street.  Is that it?  No, it's not.  Where is it?  Because I've been to Geno's.  I just don't know where it is.  Kenny knows.  Chris, where is it exactly?  Where is Geno's?  If you actually turn around, if you're standing at Pat Stakes, it's right across the street from it.  What street's it on?  Like in corner of 9th and Hashiunk or something.  Okay, well that's good for this guy.  I mean, it's not a big statement to make, please speak English.  It's like, who cares?  But just the fact that they're giving him crap for him.  What a bunch of babies.  He could probably say it's interfering with business. 
[01:48:00]  To have people that don't speak English, it takes longer to get the order done and is interfering with their business.  And how is it discouraging certain people from being there?  If you can't speak or read English, how do you order?  Yeah.  Well, that's why.  It probably takes forever.  What do you want?  Jeez.  It's about time we start forcing people to learn English in this country.  It's getting ridiculous out there.  But we won't.  The owner goes on.  He said his grandparents learned English after immigrating from Sicily in the 1920s. 
[01:48:30]  He also said no customer has ever been turned away because of the policy.  Yeah.  I mean, it's simple.  When ordering, please speak English.  He's not saying you have to speak English.  Sicily in the 20s.  I wonder how he got that company.  Genco Olive Oil.  This is great for Gino's man.  Yeah, I was in the cheese steak business with his father.  Now we're up here high in the Sierra Mountains drinking champagne cocktails. 
[01:49:00]  I don't know this Gino.  I don't know what he does.  No, you don't speak English.  You'll understand.  Believe me.  Joey Vento, the owner of Gino's in Philly.  All right, guys.  What's up, boys?  We fully support you today, sir.  Good.  Thank you.  You know, well, they got, you notice they got this discrimination suit against me.  They're suing you now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It came out yesterday.  I'm fighting it all the way.  Hola, Jose.  The sign does not come down.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  I didn't understand a word you said, by the way.  What organization is suing you?  That's the Bias or Ethnic Committee of Philadelphia, whatever.  We'd love to.  We'd probably want to get them on the phone.  I would love to.  The Bias or Ethnic Committee.  And guess who gets on the phone yesterday?  One of my famous councilmen.  Angel Ortegas.  What he is, whatever his name is.  But anyway, yeah, here's a guy.  He forgot his driver's license renewal for 25 years.  25 years.  Since 1984 when he was there. 
[01:50:00]  I'd like to know who was doing paperwork to allow him to drive a city car uninsured.  And he's got the audacity to come after a guy like me.  He should have been fired immediately.  And it's the.  He says.  He.  He.  He.  Connection.  There's a.  All waiting.  It's not like he forgot his drive clean.  He forgot his driver's license for 25 years.  But anyway, that's enough for him.  Now.  Now.  What made you.  What prompted you to put the sign up?  The sign.  I said six months. 
[01:50:30]  Guess what?  I got an email that I forgot about.  That's actually up since nine months now.  And possibly ten.  Really?  Yeah.  We're talking about a sign that says.  This is American.  When ordering.  Please speak English.  Of course.  Gino's Steakhouse there in Philly.  Was there a problem that like business was slowing down.  Like it was slowing down the rate.  I'm a self-made multimillionaire.  Over and over again.  I could have been retired.  I do this because I love it.  I'm the icon of Philadelphia.  I keep the city alive.  They come for Gino's Steakhouse. 
[01:51:00]  I mean.  If you turn Gino's Steakhouse light to come out.  You got a problem.  You won't see nothing in the city.  No, no.  That's not the issue.  That's what they're trying to make out of it.  Well, let me ask you a question.  How many people have you turned away because of this?  Well, once you find one, that'll be the one.  Okay.  So not one person's been turned away.  No, no, no.  All we do.  You point.  You this.  You mumble.  Whatever.  The difference is.  What is so hard to say?  Cheese steak.  Guess what?  You get an A for English.  The difference is.  If you can't quite tell us what cheese won't point. 
[01:51:30]  You just might not get the sandwich you want.  Maybe it's whiz or provolone or American.  You might have been whiz, but whatever's coming off the grill might be American.  That's what you're going to get.  And it's pretty much a polite sign that says, please speak English.  It doesn't demand it, and it doesn't degrade you if you don't.  It says, please.  It's that the Hispanics come over, and they're, how does that offend you?  Well, you know, listen to this.  I'll say, you know, maybe that's why they've got special programs.  Well, you know, we have a hard time.  We don't speak any English.  Well, how the frick does that sign bother you? 
[01:52:00]  Right.  It doesn't say anything to you.  How do you read it?  Right.  And if you do read it, what's it say?  When or when, please speak English.  And now you're an American.  That's all.  I took that quote out of Theodore Roosevelt on immigrants and Americans in this country.  That's where it came from.  And what he says in accent, you should, you know, if you want to be a true American,  you've got to be an American and nothing else.  Of course, if you're something else, then you're not a true American.  The language here is English, and you should be loyal to the American and American people only. 
[01:52:30]  This is Joey Vento saying, I'm a proud American.  Listen, I'm not an Italian-American.  I'm an American of Italian descent.  America comes first.  That's my loyalty.  I'm proud that I'm able to speak English.  If you think that's offensive, guess what?  Go somewhere else.  All right.  I want the people that believe the message I'm trying to get is, be a proud American.  Speak English.  All right, Joey, Joey.  Steven from Bayshore wants to ask, did the sign actually read, to all filthy wetbacks, order in English? 
[01:53:00]  No, that's one thing, you know.  It doesn't mean that.  But doesn't that show you the state of what political correctness in this stupid country is?  This guy in his own business hangs a sign like that.  Please speak English, and they want to sue him.  Yeah, what happened?  They finally found a guy that had the balls to get out there on camera that's a successful businessman  and say that message where everybody says, you're going to go out of business now.  My business doubled, by the way.  Good.  The email and faxes.  Now it's starting with the letters.  I got a stack of letters.  We just measured.  It was 10 inches high. 
[01:53:30]  It's done in American flag all over the country.  My rating, there is, all of it, the ratings are for me.  And everybody says, don't take the sign down.  The guys come by, they beat points.  I must have been on 60, 70 radio states throughout the country.  Everybody's in support.  What they failed to realize, a guy like me came across and said what everybody was thinking,  but nobody had the guts to do it.  Well, like I said, I got what you call that FU money.  All right.  Okay.  So you can't threaten me.  The worst you can do, you want to put me out of business? 
[01:54:00]  Guess what?  I'll board the damn joint up there.  I'll leave it vacant.  Won't rent it out.  I'll make it decay and give you the goddamn ghetto neighborhood that you want.  What a set of balls on this guy, right?  I love people that fight back.  You rarely see someone that fights back.  You get a little attention like this.  Most store owners would go, okay, I'm sorry.  And they would take the sign down immediately.  They don't want any problems.  But man, Joey, I like your set.  Where are you located?  No, Joey from Gino.  Nice and past chunk down south of the Italian market. 
[01:54:30]  You know what they failed to realize?  Sometimes we must choose between what is easy.  We missed that again.  Say it again.  Wait, say that again because you got a call waiting because everyone wants to talk to Joey Vento.  You have to choose between what?  Hello?  Yeah, you have to say that again because your call waiting bleeped it out.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It says, I say sometimes we must choose between what is right and what is easy.  Easy would be ripping the sign down.  Right is to stick to your guns.  And I'm sticking to my guns. 
[01:55:00]  Now, again, the official, and I would love to talk to the bias committee of Philadelphia.  They say it's bad for the tourists.  They get the wrong messages.  What they feel.  We serve tourists from the day.  Message.  When you come in from any country with a tour group, you all have interpreters.  They all have interpreters.  Right.  That's no problem.  We don't have no problem that we have fun because sometimes you want to know how you say this American.  And we make a game out of it.  Nobody's complaining years.  Now, what's happening is I woke up the country. 
[01:55:30]  That's what's scaring them.  The country is demanding it.  So, what I say to city council and Washington and senators, you better listen to the American public.  They want this nonsense to stop.  You give these special...  What makes the Spanish people so special?  They got their own button on the phone.  You know what I like to do with that button?  What button do I press for Italian?  How about German?  Yep.  How about Korea?  How about being a niche?  Why are they excluded?  You want to talk about being prejudiced?  You don't discriminate people against all the other nationalities. 
[01:56:00]  That's true.  Why is there no German button?  To press for German, press this.  We got two pieces of papers called the Daily News and the Inquirer.  They're the ones that do it.  Guess what?  This is what I said to the Daily News.  Where is the section in your paper for Spanish, you hypocrites?  Right.  There you go.  Tell them silently, if you don't speak English, you're not rid of my paper.  Give me a...  Let me tell you something.  They have a section.  It's called the police flutter.  Yeah.  And you know what else?  The biggest issue?  The police officers that tell me. 
[01:56:30]  When they stop these cars with these Mexicans, Latinos, whatever the hell you want to call  them.  I don't give a s***.  They don't speak English.  I don't care what you call them.  This guy's losing his mind.  No, he's losing his mind now.  Shut up and sit down while he's trying to get an interpreter.  In the meantime, they're going blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever language they want to speak  in.  The cop's saying in his mind, are they trying to say, one of them get to his head, one  guy grab his legs, I'll grab his guns?  I don't know that.  So I'm a little fearful of my life, and rightfully so.  And these councilmen, they're worried about getting the Olympics here. 
[01:57:00]  I said, well, excuse me, you're worried about that sign scaring the Olympics?  How about this?  How about saying, you know what?  We got the offer of Philadelphia to the Olympics.  We might just be the murder capital of the world.  You might have a chance of getting your head blown off.  Bugging is running rampantly.  We have illegals driving cars, uninsured.  We have parts of the city that are filthy.  We even have some parts of the city that are cops with a little Larry going through.  Give me a break.  Welcome to Philadelphia.  I love Philly.  This is the reason I love Philly. 
[01:57:30]  They tell it like it is.  That's all.  There's a lot of Joey Vitos in the Philly area, man.  Joey!  You're right.  I thought this call was coming from Boston for a second.  No kidding.  The way you're sounding there, Joey.  In the words of Billy Connolly, he hates his customers.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  I've never seen that before.  Everything out of context, you know?  Anything positive, they don't want to print.  Yeah.  Because positive don't sell anything.  Negative sells.  Hey, Joey, can we put a sign up on Geno's that says, 
[01:58:00]  Open Anthony support Joey Vito?  Hi.  Joey Vento, I mean.  Joey Vento.  Joey Vento.  I want everybody to support him.  It would have been nice if you got the name right.  I know.  I was all excited.  I got people to throw money in the window for my defense counselor.  Nah, you got that FU money.  Screw that.  That's right.  That's it.  Well, people, we encourage you.  I work hard.  I don't need it.  Shut up.  Right.  We get it.  We encourage people to go there and eat.  Just go there and eat.  Right.  And support this guy and make a long line.  Because every other groveling, faggoty business would have took the sign down. 
[01:58:30]  Every faggoty corporation would have taken the sign down and apologized.  Yeah.  And this guy is just getting angrier and angrier.  That's right.  Heart attack peddler.  They love ethnic jokes at Geno's.  They love the ethnic jokes.  Right?  Right, Joey?  Yep.  Like the old days.  That's right.  What's wrong with that?  Hey, they call me guinea wop.  Little midget over there.  What I care.  Right.  You know how I become tall?  I take my money out of the bank.  I stand on it.  Now I'm saying it. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, you know what I mean?  Joey!  What do they do for basketball for a guy like me?  I'm 5'6".  They're going to lower that basketball for me?  Or they're going to say, get out of here, right?  You're not big enough to play basketball.  Aren't you discriminating against me?  Right.  This guy's got the balls.  It's about time.  How long have you had the place?  It's about time to hear something like Joey.  Army?  How long have you been there?  I started in 1966 going against the biggest guy in the country.  I opened up with $6.  And you whacked him, right, Joey?  What's that?  You whacked him, right, bro? 
[01:59:30]  Well, here's the thing.  I had $6 to my name.  They gave me two chances, Slim and none, and Slim was on vacation.  Here I am, 40 years later, making statements, and I'm kicking their butt.  Good.  There you go.  How sweet of a guy could Joey Vento be?  But God forbid, oh, he's got the audacity to come here and tell people,  you better speak English because...  Because what?  You're in America, and that's what they use languages?  English!  All right, Joey, we're going to let you go with that statement. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you.  And the best words are, God bless America.  All right, Joey Vento, the owner of Gino's in Philly.  He's not taking his sign down, and we'll be watching that situation very closely.  I'd love to get them.  Boy, he's as nutty as a fruitcake.  I love Joey.  I love that guy.  You know what?  That's a guy that, yeah, he's got enough money, and he's just, like, been through enough.  He's had it.  He doesn't have to be politically correct.  He doesn't have to watch what he says anymore.  He's reached that point in his life.  Total freedom.  Let's see them sue a black college for not allowing whites, or how about, if they want 
[02:00:30]  to be anti-bias, how about suing, like, a woman's college for not allowing men in,  or how about a woman's gym?  Come on, man.  Stop it.  Groveling, stupid.  The minute you do something that is politically incorrect, that's where everybody gets their  feathers ruffled, and they have courage to stand up for it.  But on the other side, they have no courage whatsoever.  None.  Yeah, well, we got to call Joey every day.  He's very entertaining.  Anthony, this is the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, this is Nikki Sixx.  You're listening to the worst, I mean, the worst, of Opie and Anthony.  You have a better car story, though.  When Anthony's done with his cars, he just leaves them where they break down.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I used to do.  When I had my crap, everyone's had the crappy car.  Have we ever found your old car?  No, we haven't.  Anthony's old car is somewhere between here, New York City, and Boston, Massachusetts.  It was in the Mamaronek area of New York, where it broke down.  It finally just, it always made this ticking noise. 
[02:01:30]  It tick, tick, tick, tick.  It was a Dodge Ares K car, circa 1986.  Wonderful motor vehicle.  And it was ticking.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  But I always heard the tick.  And then it got to the point where I was like, hmm, is that tick getting louder?  I can't tell.  So you just turn the radio off.  That's what you do.  And then it just made a sound like the engine fell out.  And it lights, lighting up that I had never seen before on the dashboard. 
[02:02:00]  Just, bah, nah.  I was looking.  It was so many lights and smoke.  I was looking for an ejector handle.  I was sure my fighter jet was going down.  Couldn't possibly be a motor vehicle.  Couldn't have been a car.  It was just frightening.  Then I made it up the ramp, getting off on the Maranek.  And, yeah, I went.  I looked at the car.  I realized I, at the time, I had just about had the means to get a new car.  But I was just milking this for all it was worth.  And I realized, okay, now I just have to do it.  Got the screwdriver out, undid the plates, and started walking. 
[02:02:30]  Just left it.  Just left it.  And the best thing to do when you got to leave your car,  you go to the nearest U-Haul, a rider place.  Instead of renting a car, because rental cars cost a lot of money,  you could get a rider truck.  It's one way, so you don't got to bring it back.  And it's like $19.  19 bucks.  You got to pay the deposit, but when you bring it back.  So I just drove a big rider truck back.  That's a great idea.  Yeah.  Not bad at all.  Works great.  No, Rick, I didn't torch it.  That wasn't my specialty. 
[02:03:00]  I'd been around people, though, that torched their cars, which is just amazing.  A couple of guys I knew, they were into racing out there in Riverhead Raceway out east in  English Town, New Jersey.  And they'd build their own cars and race them in, like, one of the lower classes.  They were jealous of this one kid in the neighborhood that had a really nice Nova,  a little box Nova.  And one night, they stole his box Nova, stripped it of all the good stuff, and burnt it. 
[02:03:30]  Just torched it.  So I know what's going on.  Like, they told me they were doing this and everything.  I wasn't directly involved, but I had knowledge.  So they go out, and all of a sudden, I just, I hear very, very slight in the background.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, they did it.  Oh, man.  And you get that eerie feeling that you know where the cops are going when you're in on  a crime or something like that.  And, yeah, they torched it.  I never torched the car.  I would just abandon them.  Well, my dad would lose old cars like old pets. 
[02:04:00]  I've told the story a few times in the air, but when my family was done with the family  car, my dad would take it for a ride.  Kind of like when, you know, your dog's getting old and stuff, and it's time to put him to sleep.  And he has that job of taking old Sparky or Smokey or Fresco, in my case.  Oh, a little Fresco.  For a ride, and then he comes back by himself.  What happened to the dog?  We've all been there, right?  And he comes up with some nice story about how the dog's now living on a farm in upstate New York. 
[02:04:30]  On a farm.  He's running free.  Well, my dad used to do that with cars, too.  With cars, too.  Yes.  He'd take the old family car out and just...  Would he torch him?  No, but he would do kind of what you did, just take the plates off and hope for the  best.  Now, my dad, he got lazy in his old age, though, because when I was growing up, he would leave  the cars on the Cross Bronx Expressway, which used to be a great place to just leave your  car.  That was good. 
[02:05:00]  There were plenty of really good places around New York to leave your family vehicles.  You've got to explain the Cross Bronx Expressway for out-of-towners.  I mean, if you broke down on the Cross Bronx Expressway, let's say you ran out of gas, and you've  got to go to the next exit just to get gas and come back.  Maybe the trip, you know, maybe 20 minutes it'll take, okay, to get the gas, get back  to your car.  Your car will be completely gone like a bunch of crickets attacked a...  Oh, ants.  Yeah.  It was like that.  Like a bunch of ants attacked a cricket. 
[02:05:30]  They would take everything.  Yeah.  You would get back to your car.  You would have the frame left.  That's about it.  The doors are off.  There's just wires hanging out from where electronic equipment was, and your tires, of course,  gone.  And yeah, there were plenty of places like that.  The Cross Bronx, though, very good.  It looked like the Highway of Death in Kuwait, when they were all trying to leave back-to-back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just see burnt-out hulks of vehicles.  They've cleaned up that area as far as that goes.  Yeah, you don't see as many...  You can't really leave your car there anymore.  Around anywhere in New York, you really don't see as many abandoned and ripped-up cars as you 
[02:06:00]  used to.  So, back in the day, my dad would use underpasses near the river, and then the Cross Bronx Expressway.  Now, he's getting up there in age now and stuff.  The last family car he let off, half a mile from the house.  Really?  In a parking lot.  I think it was the friendliest parking lot up the street.  I'm like, Dad, what are you doing?  That's our car.  What did he do?  And then he would deny that it's our car.  I'm like, no, it's our car. 
[02:06:30]  What are you doing?  Did you walk by and go, yeah.  My whole family.  I should get my brothers on the phone, because they were still living in the house at the  time, because they were a bit younger than me.  You just walked past the car.  And they would be screaming to my dad, like, Dad, why is the Toyota or whatever up the street?  That's not our car.  No, it is.  He would deny it.  That's great.  It has the Harborfield High School bumper sticker on it.  That's our car.  What are you doing?  No.  No, it isn't.  Clever.  He never cracked?  No, he never cracked. 
[02:07:00]  We were so embarrassed.  This is not our car.  But he never got caught.  This is not the car you're looking for.  That Toyota stayed in that parking lot for, I don't know, three, four months, and then  one day it was just gone.  They towed it away.  They just towed it away, finally.  That's what my dad used to do.  Like the old pets, he would get rid of the old cars.  Also, back in the ancient days, you used to be able to take your car to the local junkyard.  And he'd give you, like, 20, 30 bucks for it.  So as long as you could limp it in there, you'd be fine. 
[02:07:30]  Now, I don't know what it is.  It's like, oh, you need all kinds of documents and the title.  Back, I remember taking a car there.  I had nothing.  There were no plates on it.  I might as well have just stolen it.  You drive it in.  All right, I'll give you 30 bucks.  All right.  Some weed money.  There you have it.  Brian's a repo man.  Hey, Brian.  How about Brett?  Huh?  Brett, you mean?  Yeah, whatever your name is.  What's your name?  I'm the repo guy.  My name's Brett.  Oh, what's up, Brett?  How's it going, guys? 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Yo, I got a horror story about a guy who tore up a Land Rover on me, man.  I put it up.  I locked it up on a wheel.  Well, and he came back, broke my stuff off, right, and crashed it right into a concrete wall.  Just because I was repoing his car, man.  I couldn't believe it, man, but that's how it works, I guess.  Who was responsible for the car?  Well, he still will be.  I mean, they'll just take it to auction and see if somebody will pay for it, but I doubt it.  Yeah.  That thing is trash. 
[02:08:30]  You know, there's a bit we used to do on the air.  We got it from Rick, matter of fact, because I think Rick brought this bit to the table  where we had the repo guys, you know, repo cars live on the air.  Yeah.  Pretty funny stuff.  Maybe we could get one happening today.  We'll see.  Yo, hey, I'll do it for you, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, sure.  I got to be down in the Bronx a little later on.  All right.  Give us a call back, Brett, all right?  I will.  I'm going to the Mets game first, so.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, because we'll call you back and everything.  We love this bit.  We haven't done it in a while.  Gerard.  What's up, Gerard?  Hey, guys. 
[02:09:00]  Anthony.  Actually, this is a question for Anthony and Opie.  Yeah.  Did you guys ever hear of trade-ins instead of just leaving the car on the side of the road?  Gerard, how long have you been listening to us?  Oh, yeah.  I guess you're right.  We're pretty lazy.  Yeah, that's true.  And not only that, the cars that I had, there was no trade-in.  And the financial state I was in, I wasn't going to go buy a car on a lot or something.  Any car I got up until 1995, any car I got was bought out of the newspaper for no more 
[02:09:30]  than $500.  Every single car I owned.  You're knocked in for a living, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a poor, so I know how it was.  So I guess I can't knock you for that.  I go into the paper.  Come on.  Your father couldn't do it?  We were poor, man.  Oh?  We were poor.  My dad was pretty lazy, too.  Oh, well.  And like Anthony, we ran these cars into the ground.  I mean, that Toyota had, I don't know, 250,000 miles or something ridiculous. 
[02:10:00]  Run them until they stop running, and then you get yourself another one.  How much are you going to get for that?  A couple hundred bucks, maybe?  Maybe, but it's worth a shot, right?  I coasted a pickup truck into it.  I literally had, like, no transmission.  Let it coast in, and they gave me, like, a thousand bucks for the damn thing, because  it was a pickup truck.  Right on.  The first relatively new vehicle I had was my mother co-signed for it, and I just effed  her over.  She co-signed for a Monza.  Remember the old Chevy Monza?  What an awful car. 
[02:10:30]  What does it all have?  A Pinto.  There was a Chevy Monza, and it was three years old or five years old or whatever it  was, but still, it was, you know, making payments and a loan.  And my mother co-signed for it.  I think I made about three payments.  Three payments.  And then just was like, eh, well.  Did they take it from you?  Yeah, that was the one I played the hiding game with.  Weren't you living in that car, too?  At one time, I had to live in that car.  Yeah, it was all I had.  I was working.  See, because I...  It was your home and your car. 
[02:11:00]  The car cost me my job, which was paying for everything.  And the repo guy came to my job where I was working.  I was working at some place out in a hop hog in the industrial park out there.  And the big repo guy comes, and he's a huge guy.  And he's like, I'm taking the car.  And I'm like, look, I was going to make that payment.  You know, all the lies that you tell and everything.  And I finally, I talked him into, I said, come back tomorrow. 
[02:11:30]  I work here.  I will have the money, or I will hand you the keys.  I go, I will have the money.  I just need one more day.  And the guy said, all right, I am coming back here tomorrow.  I quit my job.  I had to quit.  Because I knew I could get another job with the car, but I couldn't keep going to this job without a car.  So I would have been fired anyway.  So I might as well leave the job, keep the car.  And then I had to hide it.  So they didn't know where I lived. 
[02:12:00]  I changed the dresses every other week.  I was room for rent kind of thing.  And I'd park it all over the place, just camouflage it under a tree, in between two cars, very far away from where I lived.  And then someone must have ratted me out because they picked it up from the Greenlawn train station parking lot.  Oh, yep.  I came out one day.  I was like, oh, no.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, no.  Now I have absolutely nothing.  Okay, that was all I had.  Now I walk out and I'm just like, I have nothing.  Was your stuff in the car too? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  So they took the stuff?  Everything.  They shipped it back in a big box.  Oh.  They shipped it.  Well, I had a place to live at that point when they finally took it.  But all the other stuff that I had in there, you know, stuff you just keep in your car.  They sent it back in a big box, all banged up.  That's it.  All right, we've got to step aside.
