<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts jokingly self-deprecatingly describing themselves as shock jocks, launching into a discussion about the homoerotic imagery on men's underwear packaging contrasted with the lack thereof on women's. This transitioned into a rant about Long Island Expressway traffic, with Opie detailing a three-hour commute and his aggressive driving style.  The conversation then shifted to a "smash and grab" theft targeting Opie's brother's future mother-in-law, leading to a discussion about the prevalence of such crimes on Long Island and a tangent about a local strip club's name change and the perceived merits of Russian versus Long Island strippers.  A caller, Walter, requested the hosts solicit female callers to laugh at him for sexual gratification, sparking a discussion about his fetish.  The show then featured a look at photos of Vanessa Hudgens, with differing opinions on her body hair.  The recurring bit, "Is Tom Alive Friday?", was mentioned, along with upcoming appearances (a comedy show and a fishing trip, the latter leading to speculation about encountering scantily clad women while fishing).  A news story about Osama bin Laden's dyed beard and Opie's past goatee shaving experience concluded this segment. The Palm Restaurant provided breakfast.

The show continued with a discussion about one host's plan to gradually shave his facial hair, followed by humorous hypotheticals, including the reaction to someone walking around with a Hitler mustache while being overly polite, and commentary on Bob Kelly's "slappable" shaved face.  A serious, yet ultimately sarcastic, discussion followed regarding Channel 7's decision to cease broadcasting the annual 9/11 victim name readings, contrasted with their continued broadcasting of daytime talk shows. The hosts speculated on the reasons and criticized the rebuilding progress at Ground Zero.  The conversation moved to post-9/11 airport security, contrasting the heightened awareness then with current impatience.  Anecdotes about airport security and a special belt for expedited screening were shared. The rebuilding of the World Trade Center and the Freedom Tower's design were also debated.

A significant portion focused on a news story about a woman ejected from a Southwest Airlines flight for wearing a short white miniskirt and revealing top. The hosts heavily criticized the airline's decision, speculated on the flight attendant's motives, analyzed photos from her MySpace page, and discussed the possibility of a passenger complaint.  The historical context of suggestive airline advertising was also examined, accompanied by audio clips from news reports and vintage commercials.  A humorous segment featuring clips from a British comedy show quizzing Americans on their 9/11 knowledge was included, followed by listener calls, one from a caller recounting their grandmother's experiences as a flight attendant, and another discussing current airline attire. The segment concluded with discussions of an upcoming live show and their annual football picks competition, debating the use of one host's brother's expertise.

The next segment began by dismissing "The Hunting Party."  A call from a reluctant 14-year-old, Andrew, who had recently returned from Antigua, followed.  Despite the hosts' attempts to extract details, Andrew was hesitant, revealing only his interest in airplane photography, later exhibiting paranoia about this being revealed.  The show then discussed a ninja burglar stabbed by his victim, segued into a discussion about what women's lib had supposedly ruined, and transitioned to Opie's brother's upcoming wedding and bachelor party, which conflicted with another brother's fishing trip.  This led to a lengthy, humorous discussion about the logistical challenges of combining a bachelor party with an early morning fishing trip off Orient Point, including the unlikelihood of finding attractive women.  Tangents included discussions about Plum Island and the hosts' opinions on pubic hair.  The segment ended with attempts to contact Opie's brothers to resolve the scheduling conflict.

The final segment started with a discussion about food preferences and a girlfriend's weight management, contrasted with the hosts' own.  This transitioned into a highly graphic and sexually explicit discussion about "Brother Elmo's" unusual sexual preferences, detailed through listener emails and a phone call with Elmo's brother, Brett, who was a guest on the show.  The conversation shifted to Brett's bachelor party, including the fishing trip and anecdotes about a bad restaurant experience and ill-fitting tuxedos.  A significant portion recounted a past confrontation with Carol Miller, playing audio clips of their heated argument and the deliberate destruction of Rod Stewart CDs on-air.  The show concluded with more listener calls, further sexually explicit comments about Elmo, banter about cell phones, and an increasingly chaotic and abrupt ending to the broadcast.  The segment featured humorous recurring elements related to listener emails detailing Elmo's preferences.

Oh, oh, they're in the back  You have to go, uh, now you gotta look for your size  Right  And the style that you want  So just stare at nude men  Right  And, uh, see how that, see how that works for you  It used to just be a, you pick up a bag of fruit of the looms 
[00:04:30]  You know, and that's all I want  You just can't find them  They, they have that buried somewhere  And, and, you know, I, I have grown a bit  Right  In my, I'm not, you know, I'm not talking literally here as far as, uh, that  It's always been the same great size that I have  But, uh, I mean, I've grown to the point where maybe I don't want the same brand of underwear I wore when I was eight years old  Yeah  You know, so I want maybe some nice underwear 
[00:05:00]  But you, you can't buy it  We've talked about this before  You just can't buy it  You have to have your girl go in and buy that  I, I picture that you want just very little material on the sides  What?  Is that, I might be wearing those today  Let me see what I'm wearing  Oh, God  Oh, here they are  Here's what I got on today  Let me see  I have on Polo  Mm  By Ralph Lauren  Ooh  Those are my  Jimmy, what kind of underpants you got on?

Calvin Klein  Calvin Klein  All right  See, everyone's wearing  Sorry to trump you boys, but, um, I'm wearing  Lindsey's brother's  Tommy Hilfiger  On the pants  They wear your girl's brother's  I swear to God  It creeps her out every time  Why would you wear his underwear?  Well, he left them over  The, uh, the, the joint 
[00:06:00]  Yeah  Uh, and made it into the wash  Uh, made it into my underpants pile  Underpants  And when I get down to, like, laundry day  I don't have many options left  I just so happen to, to put these on  Dude  It's either that or, like, you know  Freestyle  Freestyle  Freed  Whatever they say  Yeah  I could never wear another man's underwear  Why?  Whatever  What's the big deal, man?  Because I would just know  Yeah, I know  I couldn't 
[00:06:30]  It's my girlfriend's brother's underpants  Oh  It does creep her out, though  I could not wear another guy's underwear  I don't know how you could do that  Dude, it's, it's, you know  I'm down to the, I'm down to nothing here  I got, like, three huge things of, uh, laundry  I gotta, I gotta get done  Oh, God  See, at least I'm being honest about it  I could have just said  These are my Tommy Hilfiger  You know what?  You know what?  I, I, I would, I would go out  With no underwear 
[00:07:00]  And go to, like, across the street  And buy a package of, uh, underwear  Yeah  Go to the bathroom, put it on  Cause wearing another man's underwear  That doesn't matter how many times it's been washed  You're, you're pretty much junk to junk by proxy  Oh, God  It is  I don't say it's, it's homoerotic  I just think it's, I just can't do it  Like, how many times you had the flu wearing those?  Oh, yeah  How many times after a drinking bender  Did he sneeze a little harder than he intended to do? 
[00:07:30]  All right, well, that's how we start today's show  Phone number 877-212-ON-A  Uh, a bit tired  I, I went out to Long Island  For my brother's, uh, rehearsal dinner last night  He's getting married Sunday  But the traffic must have taken 20, 25 minutes  For the rest of, uh, the country  I had an hour  I had an hour, I had an hour ride ahead of me  I left at 2.45  I arrived where my brother's gonna get married 
[00:08:00]  At 6 o'clock  Do the math, yes  That would be close to 3 hours  3 hours  3 enraging hours  Is what that amounts to  My jaw is twitching  As, as I, when you said you left at 2.15  My jaw shifted to the left  You just wanna start killing people  And that's why I don't acknowledge politicians whatsoever  Yeah, I'll fool around with it a little bit on the air  And go, ah, maybe this guy's a little better than this guy  But they're all, they're all you-know-whats 
[00:08:30]  Because you go out to, you know, Long Island  This is my ride  And everyone else has their own ride  Which has its own problems  And the Long Island Expressway  Now, one politician sees that there's a major problem there  That they need to fix  Yeah  But they're too busy going after violent video games  And all these other dumb little things  Yeah, the easy marks  When these real issues  Easy marks  Will never get, you know, better  I don't know what else they could do about it  Like, at this point, there's nothing we could do  Alright, so what are we supposed to do?  Just go, ah, there's nothing we could do 
[00:09:00]  Just leave it as is  We've been doing that on Long Island for years  Ever since I know anybody  You shouldn't have, you shouldn't leave at 2.30 in the morning  From the city to Long Island  And get stuck in three hours of traffic  Three hours  And there was no construction delays  There were no  Short days of four  There were  They even have that figured out  Where there's not much shoulder room  To get by  You can't even do that  You can't even risk a ticket by riding the shoulder  What about the HOV lane?  Dude, the three hours that I just told you? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah  It would have been four, minimum, maybe five  If I didn't hit the HOV lane  Ah  Eventually, that's the problem  See, you have to go  I don't know how many miles  Before you get to the HOV  Then you get in that  And then you're tooling by everybody else  Going 70, 75 miles an hour  While they're bumper to bumper  Do you pay attention to the lines on the HOV lane  Where you're supposed to come in and out?  Oh, yeah, yeah  Because I don't  No, I'll go  I swear to you  If I'm behind some old codger  In the HOV lane 
[00:10:00]  Doing 45 miles an hour  Which, by the way  That should be grounds for murder  You should be able to kill someone  If they're  How can you drive in the HOV lane  And see nothing but horizon in front of you  Look behind you and see cars three inches from your bumper  In a parade  Yeah  And not go  Perhaps I'm the problem here  Yeah  You're effing up everyone's day  Yeah 
[00:10:30]  So I whip right around them  And I will cut in so close  That I have a fantasy of seeing them hit that cement barrier in my mirror  And I would be so long gone  Yeah  Oh, I am an offensive driver  People around the country think they know bad traffic  And I'm sure all of you have awful traffic  L.A. stinks  A lot of places  You're talking to Boston this morning  They got their issues up there, man  Worst I've ever hit  And I've been everywhere in the country  Trap  Long Island  The L.A.E.  Is a major problem  I almost cried one time  Yeah 
[00:11:00]  Pull over and wept  Yeah  Yeah  Boston has its problems  You know  I lived in that area  I know what the traffic was like up there  Boston has its problems  Because their roads stink  That hub system is ridiculous  They had to revamp the roads  But it's not to the extent of length  You will not be on a road for that long  Sitting in that much traffic  You can't sit in three hours of traffic in the Boston area 
[00:11:30]  You can if something happens  I understand that  But on a consistent basis  You're not doing that  There just isn't enough miles of road  Yeah  When you're in New York City  And then you go out to Long Island  You are screwed  For hours  And miles  And miles  You're talking 50 miles  Of traffic  And you gotta understand  On the other side of Manhattan  Is Jersey obviously  Yeah that's another nightmare  But it's not that bad  When you're trying to get through the tunnels 
[00:12:00]  Well the tunnel's a nightmare  But as soon as you get on the other side  It's not that bad  You gotta do the same thing  To get to the Long Island Expressway  Right  And you know  I'm from Long Island originally  And knows  You know  Everyone knows that  For the most part  And there are times I wanna leave on a Saturday morning  Like I had a long week of  You know  Doing radio  Whatever  And I just wanna go out  And see my family  I'll leave on a Saturday  Around noon  1130  Same crap  Yeah  Maybe not three hours  But two  Two hours and 15 minutes  And it should be less than an hour ride  At that point  No rhyme or reason 
[00:12:30]  And the politicians don't even acknowledge  This crap is going on  It's just business as usual  And they'll go after  Like I said  The dumbest things  You'll see them pop up on the news  And it's like  We got real issues  Well why don't you take on that  Take on making the LIE  You know easier  You know  You wanna talk about stress  And people dying  You know  They talk about violent video games  And it's killing our kids  And it's causing this and that  Just imagine what's sitting in three hours  Of traffic causes  I gotta tell you  I gotta disagree with you  How many guys have dropped dead of heart attacks 
[00:13:00]  Because they're stressed out  On that damn road  I gotta disagree with you though  Why?  Because I can't see the politicians doing anything  From years of driving  I know what the problem is  It's morons  People are  They're effing stupid  They don't know  If there's a cop  That has a guy pulled over  On the side of the road  You're screwed for an hour of traffic  Because why?  Someone wants to  Step on the brake  And God  God help  The idiot  That steps on  If I see brake lights  When there's a cop 
[00:13:30]  Pulling a guy over  If the guy in front of me  Steps on his brake lights  Beep  I am on the horn  On his ass  Flipping him off  Calling him a vulture  Even an accident  I don't care  If you can get a fleeting glimpse  At your friggin accident  You want entertainment  You want to see some blood  That's fine  Do it at 65 miles an hour at least  Yeah  Don't slow down  Unless you're a doctor  And you're gonna stop  And start breathing into someone's mouth  Keep moving  There is a volume problem though too 
[00:14:00]  There's just a ridiculous amount of cars  Get them all moving  Get them all moving  And here's a little something  Down the road  I want to move back to Long Island  I want a house in the suburbs  You know what?  We're not going to do it  Because of that effing traffic problem  I'll move to Nassau County  Or Jersey  Or Westchester  I'm probably gonna do Jersey  Because you can't  You'll drive yourself  Freaking nuts  Nothing against Jersey  Driving home every day  Jersey rocks  Oh shut up  With the goddamn 
[00:14:30]  With your stupid  Jug handle  Left turns  Let me make a left hand turn  For frig's sake  I gotta drive around in Jersey  Oh we gotta make a left  Oh I gotta go three miles  To the jug handle  Because they can't trust people  To make left turns  What's the matter in Jersey?  They just turn left  And someone broadsides them  Get off at the jug handle  What the hell is that?  I've never heard of a jug handle  Oh dude  It's when you gotta take the off ramp  I know what you're talking about  But I didn't know  It was called a jug handle  It's called a jug handle 
[00:15:00]  Because on a map  It looks like a little jug handle  I thought it was a rotary  Oh no  The rotaries are another thing  That's in Boston  Go around the rotary  In Massachusetts  Who has the right of way?  It's the guy in the rotary  Oh  Not when I'm driving  Loves their rotary  And Jersey loves their what?  Their jug handles  They can't just make a left  Make a left Jersey  A jug handle 
[00:15:30]  That's great  My motto  I swear  It's just  Get out of my way  Right  Get the hell out of my way  No one is driving faster than me  So don't even try  That's  Driving to work in the morning  There's not much traffic at all  I love it  I can do 85  90 miles an hour  But here's this problem now  Even at that hour  Someone's in the left lane  They're doing 65 let's say  That's fine  I have no problem with that  I'm not going to get on his ass 
[00:16:00]  And make a move  He's in the left lane  He's going over the speed limit  I'm fine  I'll go over into the middle lane  And goose it  And go around him  Sometimes people feel compelled  To go  You ain't passing me  And speed up to like 70  And I'm going  Dude  Don't even try  I'll go to 110  Just to make a point  I'll go to 110 miles an hour  And now you're the idiot behind me  Because you're not going to stop me 
[00:16:30]  From getting into left lane  And continuing my journey  You're not the fastest on the road though  I am absolutely the fastest person  On the road every morning  No one passes me  Faster than the ninja motorcycle guys  I pass the ninja motorcycle guys  No you couldn't pass them  They don't go that fast in the morning  Those ninja motorcycle guys  We're also on their board  So they start doing wheelies  At 80 miles an hour  Right next to you  In the afternoon  How great is those guys man  I like where they weave in and out of traffic  That's good  Like they're playing a video game 
[00:17:00]  But at that hour  I've passed some monster cars  Yeah  Because you know  You've got to step on the gas pedal  Yeah  And that's me  I've got to be in the clear  I don't like people in front of me  Because they're never going to go  As fast as I want to go  Get out of my way  Can I point out that your motto  Get out of my way  Is not a very nice motto  It's not  And I didn't say it's a nice motto  It's mine though  We're so self-destructive  And Jimmy's trying to keep us like  You know normal or whatever  It's just  Because he talks about speed 
[00:17:30]  And I'll sit there like  Yeah alright I like this  It gets my adrenaline pumping  I had some guy  The other morning  Cut in front of me  As I was  Whaling up the middle lane  He cuts in front of me  I lock up the wheels  I have anti-lock braking  And locked the wheels up  And then kind of drifted  Into the right lane  It was a move  As if I was glancing  At a rest stop sign  Coming up  Right  It just kind of went  My pulse rate  Didn't go over 65 
[00:18:00]  I was that like  I could care less  About this guy  If he goes into the wall  I know I was fine  Yeah  But they panic  Yeah  Like people panic  On the road  You ever see two cars  When they're both changing lanes  From the right lane  And the left lane  And they both want to get  Into the middle lane  At once  It happens  If you're looking  And you see a guy  Come over  You can gently  Get back into your lane  I've seen people make moves  That it's like a child 
[00:18:30]  Is in the middle of the street  And they cut the wheel  He's trying to come in the same lane  Gently go back where you were  And then figure it out  You know  You mentioned anti-lock brakes  Yeah  You remember the first time  That you had a car  With anti-lock brakes  That scared the crap out of you  Because of your pedal  Right  All of a sudden you push him  And go  Oh no  I don't have any brakes  Your pedal's going  Maybe they should teach you  You know  How to use those things 
[00:19:00]  Before you pull out  Of the car dealership  Now your pedal might jiggle  And shake  I remember the first time  I had a jam on the brakes  I'm like  Oh great  I have no brakes  Oh  It's infuriating  Around here  And like Jim said  Other cities have their traffic  But believe me  To us  It's cute  It's cute  Long Island is a nightmare  So I'm a bit tired  Because it was three hours out  Then I got to tell you  What happened at the rehearsal dinner  And then I'm calling in 
[00:19:30]  In the middle of the night  Going hey man  I'm going to be late today  This is  I'm leaving St. James  At 10 o'clock at night  That's insane  When you get up at 4.30  Good luck to you  Can I ask a question  Why don't you just take a train out  And then get a car to come back  I should have  It would be easier for you  I really thought at 2.30  You know  Stupid me  That how bad  Could the traffic be  It's a couple hours  Before rush hour  You're right Jimmy  Because that's exactly  What I said  When I was in  Bumper to bumper traffic  I turned to Lindsay  I go  Wow  Maybe we should have  Taken a train  Rush hour is truly  All the time 
[00:20:00]  Yeah  I was driving down  25A  In  Up there  By Glen Cove  Yeah  And saw a wreck  On the side of the road  Where it was fresh  Fresh wreck  I think someone was  Still in a car  There were people  Laying out on the grass  One guy had his head  You know  Between his knees  And his hands  I couldn't get past  This fast enough  And I wailed on the horn  At somebody in front of me  That stepped on the brakes  Get  Why are you stopping 
[00:20:30]  Why  Is that entertainment  Yeah  Is it  You could see  You could take a glimpse  At what's going on  But why should it affect  Everybody trying to get  To where they're going  You're completely right  And I've done it  But the view on that  We really are  It's savage  People just look  Because it's an instinct  To look at something  In your species  That is wrecked  But people just look  They don't mean it  I understand  You're the guy  That doesn't look  Come on Ant  Everyone looks  I don't slow down either  Dude I look at about  65 miles an hour  I will 
[00:21:00]  And if I can  Sometimes  On purpose  I don't look  Because I don't care  I'm looking at the person  In front of me  Going don't you look  Don't you effing look  Because my hand  Is on the horn  And my finger  Is ready to go up  And god forbid  You are not of my ilk  Because I will yell  Something out at you  That points it out  You ever tell your co-pilot  You're like  Alright look  I need details  I need details  Give me all the details  Let me go by  What happened  I yell out  Who's driving

[00:22:00]  Ant just said  But remember  We would like  Depending on the car  That we're about to pass  If you see a white van  We would guess  Full of spray painted  Symbols you can't recognize  Right  You know  That it's coming from  Probably a delivery  From Chinatown  Perhaps  It kept us entertained though  Every car we pass  We would guess  Alright who's driving  Is it a black guy  Is it a Hispanic  Is it a soccer mom  Is it an older Jewish gentleman  Yeah  Is it some dude  In his  You know  White dude

[00:52:00]  Hosts usually have  Something a little  Special for 720  Right  Tom's not calling  Today  Let me tell you  We've been doing  This bit for over  A month  And I'm not going  To lie to you  We tease it a little bit  We know he's alive  And we sit here like  When should we  Tell everyone Tom's alive  Tom hasn't checked  In yet today  We're an hour  And ten minutes  Into this bit  Tom could you call  For the new listeners  Tom  How do you explain  Tom is a guy  Is he in his 30s  I don't know 
[00:52:30]  I think he might be older  He sounded younger  But yeah he's older  And he's got  Severe respiratory problems  Like terminal  His doctor told him  That he has seven years  To live  And that doesn't sound bad  Until you realize  His doctor told him  That six years ago  Right  So he's pretty much  On his last year  Yeah  He can't breathe  He can hear when he talks  Like sometimes he's okay  But then the last time  Last week  Was just  You know he was  Wheezing a little  And couldn't really  Catch his breath 
[00:53:00]  And now  He's not calling  So  I don't  Screw Tom  Freshwater bodies  Lake Havasu  Arizona  What is this  Website  Iraq  Dude  There is something  Going on  How do I  In Arizona  I haven't  Wanted  I haven't joined  A website  In years  I want to join  This one  What is this  Iraq  It's a  It's a composite  Of all the  The hot water bodies  For spring break  And photos 
[00:53:30]  Of activities  That go on there  Look at this girl  Like completely  Bent over the side  Of the boat  This is how I've  Researched my  Retirement spots  Most people go  For real estate  Value  And things like that  Or golf courses  I'm like  I believe there's  Boatloads of  Naked broads  Oh my god  And they  They have the  Class of 2007  Oh boy  Yeah  Yeah  Something about  That fresh water  They love  Ripping them  Clothes off 
[00:54:00]  And jumping  Jumping on in  Alright listen  We'll do a  You know  We'll actually  Start doing  Real radio  Osama bin Laden  Has what  Died his beard  And there's a  Big story today  What are we  Talking about  I don't know  Front page of  The daily news  It's a cute  Headline  Right  How many people  Died  Soldiers  From the 9-11  Initial attacks  And then the  Soldiers since  Yes of course  Daily news is  Having fun today  Out of the  Oh no that's not  Even the one 
[00:54:30]  That I want  It's the post  Actually  They both have  Osama bin Laden  On the cover  But the post  Has a cute  Headline  It says  Just die  Already  C-D-Y-E  Because he's  Dying his beard  Allegedly  Or apparently  Or something  He  Well  He's  He must have  A publicist  Now  Because he's  Saying that  They're  They're going to  Release a video  Right  Within 72  Hours  Right  And he's  Going to  Make a  Statement  Based on 
[00:55:00]  The anniversary  Of 9-11  Which is  Obviously  Coming up  And he's  Going to  Make kind  Of a  Rah  Rah  We rule  We kick  Their ass  Kind of  Statement  And try to  Get al-qaeda  All whipped  Up into a  Frenzy  Again  And  We haven't  Seen him  In years  Osama  And now  They show  A picture  That's supposed  To be  Portedly  From this  Videotape  And it  Doesn't  Even  Kind of  It doesn't  Really look 
[00:55:30]  Like him  See the  Last time  We saw  Osama bin  Laden  He had  A big  Long  Gray  Beard  He was  Looking  Pretty  Gaunt  And pale  And  Not  Very  Spry  And in  This  Picture  His  Beard  Is  Black  He's  Dited  I guess  And  He looks  Like he's  Got a  Little  More  Color  In his  Face  It's  A little  Tan  Yeah  Maybe  He's  Maybe  He's  Doing  Letterman  A little 
[00:56:00]  Inside joke  Oh my god  I covered  A few  Grays  That day  Did you  Yeah  Because they  Sparkle  In the  Camera  They  Sparkle  So I  Just  Kind of  Covered  A few  How'd  You  Cover  Them  I  Took  A little  Brush  And  I  Took  A little  Brush  And I  Went  Then I  Covered  Them  Up  Laughing  When I  Shaved  Remember  When I  Shaved  Everyone  Laughed  At me  It was 
[00:56:30]  Creepy  Takes  Some  Getting  Used  To  I  Got  To  Figure  A  Way  To  Do  It  Because  You're  A public  Figure  And everyone  Knows you as  Anthony  And the  Goatee  And when you  Finally shaved the  Goatee when we were off the air  I know what you're talking about  It was creepy  Because it was a different look  That's the only reason I'm saying that  It looks like it had no lip or something  Well anytime someone shaves a mustache  That's pretty drastic  Because yeah  You haven't seen their  Like upper lip  That segment between the nose and lip  A segment  But I gotta figure out a way 
[00:57:00]  Maybe  Just shave  Man has a tiny chin  Who's that huge unit  I don't have a tiny chin  I got kind of a big chin  My chin isn't tiny is it  No it's nice  That's a nice chin  No  But the thing is  I gotta figure out a way to shave  Where it's so gradual  That no one notices  I say just  Do it  And then  You know  One day  People will comment for like a month  And then that'll go away  One day with a Hitler mustache  How about that  I walk around like that  Because that'll get everybody 
[00:57:30]  Like freaked out  Are you insane  What's wrong  Do you think there would be a problem  Walking around with a Hitler mustache  For a day  Being nice to everybody  That would be funny  If you were overly polite  In a Hitler mustache  Yeah  Oh can I get that for you  Like walk into Starbucks  And you know  Hey  I'd like to buy everybody  Some coffee today  And see how they react  I don't want coffee from you  I love the guys out there  They know they look good  With the Hitler mustache  But they can't completely  Like commit 
[00:58:00]  Yeah  So it's almost a Hitler mustache  It's like almost a cop marine  Kind of mustache  Where it's way in on the side  Even closer in than that  But not quite the Hitler  Some of those drivers  You see at the airports  It's like what are you doing man  What's up  What's up with that  So big story I guess  Osama is dying his beard  You know what  Bob Kelly shaved his beard and mustache  Yeah  And can I  You've never seen anything more slappable  Than that steel face  You just want to smack his fist  Steel face 
[00:58:30]  He's  Because Bob is bald  Yeah  He looks  It looks bad when he shaves  Because he really should be  In a room with Martin Sheen somewhere  Yeah  He's just a big dumb Colonel Kurtz  But he has none of the inside  Of Colonel Kurtz  Dad  There was a pile  Of a doctor  I'm a renegade  Hey really fast  We're talking about 9-11  God we talked about this years ago  And it's coming true  And not to make light 
[00:59:00]  Obviously  Of 9-11  But every year they read the names  Down there at Ground Zero  Yeah that's been like a tradition  They ring the bell  They read the names  And it's televised  Especially here in New York City  I don't know about the rest of the country  If they all pick it up  But here in New York  It's been a standard thing  For the past six years  And we've had discussions  Over the last few years  We asked ourselves  How long is it going to take  Before they stop broadcasting the names  Yeah  And Channel 7 here in New York 
[00:59:30]  Has decided this is the year  This is the year  This is the year to stop doing it  They'd rather broadcast Regis  And  Which is very weird to me  Because they're making a decision  That's kind of strange  They're basically telling everyone  That Regis and Kelly  Much more important than the reading of the names  And Rachel Ray  And Rachel Ray  And The View  And The View  Much more important than the reading of the names  It's the reading of the names  Now  You might go 
[01:00:00]  Maybe it's  I don't know  Maybe it is time  To move on from that part  But a mere couple years ago  You know  These stations would have  People would have thought  They were insane  If they didn't broadcast  The reading of the names  People still are aggravated about it  It's almost like  It's for one day a year  It's only for a little bit of time  The buildings are not even put up  Right  It's like  It's still a mess down there  Yeah  Yeah they're still trying to figure out what to do  That's the bureaucratic bull crap 
[01:00:30]  That's going on down there  It has nothing to do  They could have built 18 buildings down there  In the years since  And they pretty much have  Jerks  I was down there recently  Everywhere around Ground Zero  Is pretty impressive  There's a lot of new buildings down there  Yeah they built some big buildings  But there's still a freaking hole in the ground  Where the Twin Towers  That's because no one wants that stupid Freedom Tower  Except I don't know what kind of deals were made in back rooms  And what money traded pockets over there  Between government officials and builders 
[01:01:00]  But everyone wants towers back over there  Modernize it  Make it look different  Build them so they're as safe as they could be  But to build this stupid Freedom Tower  It's a reaction to having your teeth kicked in  Instead of building two more  They should build two towers  And somehow connect them  Where you can get out  Oh like they do in  In Malaysia  Yeah the Malaysians  They're only connected on one place  If you connect them on a couple of places  There's ways to make it safer 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  They speculate that they wouldn't be able to rent the top floors  They would  You know something  Real estate in New York City  They'd rent the goddamn top floors  I don't know people who honestly  I don't know people who rent the top floors  If you don't make them as high  You make them pretty impressive  But you just don't make them as high  You know  And in six years  We should have had something by now  Since the time I moved into my building  I know it's  You can't really compare  They already have a new building built  Down the road  They put these things up fast  I watched the whole thing built in the last 
[01:02:00]  The mere months  How long did it take  Back in the early 70s  To build  The Trade Center?  Oh forever  Did it?  Yeah absolutely  Yeah  No I mean  I think it was more than a couple of years  That's what I'm talking about  Forever  They have figured out how to put these buildings up fast  So they could have put up two World Trade Center towers  I would say easily  In the six years  Easily at this point  Yeah  If they started  You know  Would have been done  If they start a year later  Easily  So Channel 7 here in New York 
[01:02:30]  Will tune out reading of the names  I guess they're in a tough position  Someone had to like start this  Next year  I don't think any station will broadcast the reading of the names  But is that  My thing is  You might be  It's a tough position  But it's also  It's the same mentality  That's making them not do that  Which is the same reason now  If you profile at an airport  You're a racist again  The same way you were on September 10th of 2001  Now the thinking  Yeah  Americans  We are dummies  You're going back to that thinking  It's like  Yeah people forget really quickly  Yes  You know  Yeah  Because remember 
[01:03:00]  Remember what the airports were like  Shortly after September 11th  Oh man  Where you'd go in there  And everyone was looking around  Everyone was a deputized air marshal  We were all looking around  Going  Alright  Let's keep our eye on this gentleman  And the whole plane  Would watch the man of Arab descent  The entire flight  That guy couldn't go up to use the restroom  Without five guys standing up ready to tackle him 
[01:03:30]  And you didn't mind being in long lines  No  No  The line  Now if you've got a five minute wait through security  You're pissed off  It's like  I double knotted my shoes  Damn it  That's what I was bitching about  When we were flying  Really  From the Bahamas  I'm like  I double knotted my shoes  Now I gotta untie him again  Well you gotta do what Kenny does  A what  Kenny wears a plastic belt  So he can get through security better  With his belt on  He should hang himself with it  What is it  You've seen it  It's cloth  It's cloth 
[01:04:00]  And he's all prepared  To go through security  It's  Stupid belt  It's really awkward  It's for beating ethnics  Right  What do you wear when you go through security there  Club soda  Yeah it's like  My birthday suit  A nylon belt with a plastic buckle  So you can just walk straight through the middle  Yeah so he doesn't have to take his belt off  Kenny's pants bother me  Because they're always a little too high on his waist  And tucked in  I don't know if they are today  No today they're okay  Oof 
[01:04:30]  Okay  How are we doing today  Boy prepared  That's nice  Like a boy scout  World Trade Center started in 1961  No come on  Stop it  First tower was finished in 1970  Second tower in 1972  And then  Maybe the initial pencil hit the paper in 61  What  Come on  66  66  They started construction  And they had to lay down a water tight basin  Down there  They had to move 
[01:05:00]  They had to move land  And dredge up dirt  To actually put dirt there  Where that was built  So it wasn't even like  They just had to build buildings  They had to prepare  And build a cement tub  That the building sat in  Because the foundations were so deep  That water was going to seep in  So they had to do a lot more  Than they would have to do now  And with  You know that kind of technology back then  Slush wall I think they called it  Yes the slush wall  We all learned about  Did you ever see photos of Philippe Petit  I think I talked about him the other day 
[01:05:30]  Philippe Petit  The guy who tightrope walked in between the buildings  That lunatic  He went back and forth like seven times  Why  Did the sun walk  After four  Wouldn't you be like  I made it  I would  Why  Four times  Why keep going  People  Why do you do that  Just stay there  It was back in the day  Where people liked seeing that daredevil stuff  I still like seeing it  People kind of  Let me just watch you  Who was the climber  George Wellig  No who was it  Yes good call  Was it George Wellig who climbed  Yeah he would climb  Or one of the towers  And then it was done by a guy named Spider Dan 
[01:06:00]  And then  Spider Dan  Oh I wish he fell  He almost did off of a building  Of the John Hancock building in Chicago  They started with firemen up there  He was on like the 30th floor  He was using rubber suction  And so the firemen decided to start hosing  Although he wasn't using rubber suction  That's great  God bless Chicago  They just started hosing him  What is he a bug  They were hosing  They were hosing him from way above  And because he wasn't using rubber suction 
[01:06:30]  He would have fallen off  And  Oh the water running down  And the cops made  The firemen stopped  The cops said  If you continue  We will tow your trucks  Off this property  Do not fire hose this  Because there's news cameras  And the mayor had to go up  The female was the mayor  And there's video of her  And there's Spider Dan  Who would be a douche  If he wasn't climbing a building  Yeah but the name alone  It's terrible  Spider Dan  And his name was Dan  Spider Dan  I want to call Danny Spider Dan 
[01:07:00]  I'm not going to catch on  Better than most other people  Drunk  Exactly  Well let's get a call from Chicago  You know  Help us out with the Spider Dan stuff  There's pictures of it  And they started hosing off  To try to prevent him  From climbing  Any higher  But he's already 30 floors up  So they pretty much  Were trying to kill him  And the mayor said  Are you ready to go up  Are you willing to accept  The consequences  And he's like  Yes I am  And they let him go  And he climbed it  Yeah  But Alain Robert  If that's how you say his name  The little Frenchman  Did the Sears Tower 
[01:07:30]  With no equipment  He climbs these buildings  In 40 minutes or an hour  No equipment at all  Just bare hands  Floor  All he has is  His back is powder  Which he dusts his hands  Like a rosin bag  And he was on the 90th floor  Of the Sears Tower  And fog set in  So from 90 to 110  The last 20 floors  It was very wet  Oh my god  And they say  It was a very slow climb  But he does it  Without an ounce of equipment  That's crazy  I talked about him a lot  It's just nuts  Look him up  He's a very brave man  Brave? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah  That's stupid  That's interesting  Why would you do that?  So really fast  So Channel 7  Will tune out  Reading of the names  The city's top rated TV station  Will slash its coverage  Of the September 11th  Memorial ceremonies  By dropping the most emotional part  The reading of the names  Of the victims  Sure let's get to  Regis and Kelly  It's good  Channel 7 says  It's running live  With Regis and Kelly  Regis  There you go  I'm much more important  And we'll follow it up  With Rachel Ray  And The View  While every other  Broadcast station in town  Will cover the ceremony  Start to finish 
[01:08:30]  Yeah  It marks the first time  One of New York's  Local broadcast stations  Has opted not to broadcast  The full reading  Of the 2,749 names  Well when  When do you stop?  Because you're not  Going to do it  For 20 years  I think what you do  Is you say  Look  You know  We're going to do this  For the first 10 years  And then  10 years you say?  Well whatever  Just prepare people  And go alright  And then after that  Say this is going to be  Our last year  But then people  Got a year to bitch about it  And they put it on their 
[01:09:00]  HD channel  They are showing it  But on their HD channel  Or something  Oh really?  Yeah  I think it's in there  Oh  I was watching some show  On Hiroshima  Last night  On HBO?  Yeah  Yeah  Did you see that?  Did you see the young people  That they were asking  You know  What happened  On August  7th  Or August 6th  And  August 9th  In Nagasaki  They're asking these people  And they said  I  I don't know  They don't know? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  They didn't know  All these young people  Just like  Oh I don't know  I don't know  It's like they ask  Americans too  The same thing  They'll find dumb teenagers  In Japan  And they ask them  What happened on this date  They did it in Hiroshima  And Nagasaki  And they didn't  They didn't know  I don't know  What happened  Yeah  Wouldn't  Would you think  Like people  In their  Late teens  Early 20s  Would know  Like  December 7th  Probably not  But they do know  September 11th 
[01:10:00]  Yeah  That just happened  That's not really fair  But  Well  It's funny you should say that  Something has been sitting around here  For a long time  Yeah  And 9-11's right around the corner  British show  Find stupid Americans  And ask 9-11 questions  Not right  Stupid Brits  When did the 9-11 terrorist attack  Take place  Uh  2000  Was it 2002  I think  2004  And I was in New York  When it happened  I don't even remember  And they're laughing 
[01:10:30]  This is part of a comedy show  Everybody  And those stupid Americans  Oh  I'd rather  Oh god  When a studio audience  Laughing along  Die  What a bunch of morons  Kicked your ass  Why don't they  Why don't they ask you  Another poignant question  Like the exact date  That that overhyped  Blonde anorexic  Was smashed in a tunnel  By a drunk driver  With her head  Bobbing up and down  Where it probably 
[01:11:00]  Shouldn't have been  Right  Why don't you ask that question  On British TV  Instead of paying tributes  And throwing flowers  At that stoic cadaver  That you idiots  Still allow to occupy  That invaluable real estate  Laughing  Just laughing  Just like they are  That are tragedies  It continues  Listen to this  In what month  Did the 9-11  Attacks take place?  October  Uh  August  I think  August  In the month  Of October  How is this 
[01:11:30]  For a comedy show?  But  How can people  Be so god damn stupid?  Laughing  Here's a question  For Britain  And aren't Britain stupid?  Here's the question  What country  Despite having  Muslim attacks against it  Continues to coddle  The radicals?  Our country  Great Britain  Ah yeah  You are smart  Brother  You are smart  Oh my word  You are smart 
[01:12:00]  Bunch of dopes  Can you recall  Can you recall  The exact date  Of the 9-11 attacks?  Well  It was September 9th  September 9th  Yeah it was  What?  September  9-11  September 1st  September 1st  September 1st  1-16th I think  15th?  1-16th  16th of August  Okay  There's nothing 
[01:12:30]  I hate more  Than some  Snotty  British TV  Has been really funny  Like The Office  But this thing  That these Brits  Are so brilliantly witty  When most of them  Are dry  And most of their  Stand-ups  Just make muggy faces  And do cornball  1981  Stand-up irony  Yeah  I like to spit  In the faces  There's still nobody  In England  Who touches  What Richard Pryor  Did in 74  People are saying  That this is from  Australia  Well okay  Then aren't we idiots  But we were told  It was Britain 
[01:13:00]  How about this  The guy doesn't  Sound Australian  Sorry  I think he does  Actually  He sounds English  I think he does  Sound Australian  Does he?  Yeah but then again  Now if you say  That he's from New Zealand  I'll go you know what  I meant to say that  Because I'm a dumb  Sorry  Alright I apologize  England  What religion  Did the 9-11  A terrorist belong to  Was it Hindu  Islam  Or atheist  Hindu  Australian  Hindu  They were stupid  That's what religion  They were stupid  They were like  Some stupid Muslims  Or whoever they were 
[01:13:30]  Good  Good answer  Stupid Australians  We should  Sorry England  Alright I apologize  Now England  Doesn't deserve an apology  Either  They were very nice  We should do the same  Okay  We should do the same  Bit on the streets  Of New York  See if people remember  A mere six years later  Yes  What  What  A previous criminal  Dumping ground  Is now a mediocre country  With a military  That means nothing  And a bunch of kangaroos  Kicking them in the balls  8 billion square miles 
[01:14:00]  Of land  And two major cities  What  What country  Still thinks that  Shrimp on the barbie  Is a catchy  Little phrase  Whose national hero  Got killed  By a docile  Flying fish

[01:20:00]  Because I don't even check it anymore  MySpace is a dumb fad  I'm done with it  That I'm not gonna be part of  I will not be party to that anymore  I'm proud that I was never part of the MySpace thing  Well you should have been at some point  Probably  Alright blow that picture up E-Rock  You can't?  Alright he's gonna say  Well  Save it  Her MySpace which is private  Uh  Ass  Come on E-Rock  Sorry  What are you doing Eric?  You're just wrecking everything  E to the R  Why don't you just be a friend? 
[01:20:30]  He's all nervous  I know  About his upcoming  Well basically she's wearing like lingerie  On her MySpace  Yeah  Page  It's a black bra  And very very sexy  What was she wearing under the skirt?  Boy shorts  But very short  Boy shorts  I'd love to know who did that  Or some big fatty complained  Or some fatty that works for the airline  Well what do we find out  Or someone  Wow  Whoa  Or someone sitting next to her  Hey why don't you take a look at that?  Alright let me go over there  It's hot man  Let me take a look  So she's got a black bra  Victoria's Secret bra 
[01:21:00]  That's very obvious  And then she's got the  Alright  The tiny boy shorts  Alright  Yeah  That's not what she's wearing on the plane  She's lovely  No no  Even that's acceptable on a plane  Should be right?  You see more on the beach  I say  You see more on the beach  At least you know she's not concealing a weapon  Right guys?  Right  Easy through security  Hey hey hey  What you hiding up there?  Bush  Then again she does have two  She has a nice set of guns  So  No guns allowed on the plane 
[01:21:30]  Oh ho  She got a couple  Wow  Alright here's  Let's meet  That works a little better  Let's meet Kyla Ebert  The hot piece of ass  That was kicked off a plane  For dressing too sexy  She's 23 years old  She's blonde  She's beautiful  And she's in the news today  She's a Hooters girl  Wow  And she's a Hooters  For an airline flight  Or inappropriate attire  That's the controversy  Sparked by this 23 year old woman  Who says 
[01:22:00]  She was escorted off a Southwest flight  Because her outfit was offensive  Kyla Ebert says  She was asked to go home and change  And after refusing  She eventually was allowed to fly  But says  A Southwest airline employee  Told her to pull up her tank top  And pull down her skirt a little  Her mother is outraged  Saying her daughter  Seen here with co-workers  At Hooters  And with friends  On her MySpace page  Dresses like any other girl  Her age  Many people who have seen  What she was wearing  Agree 
[01:22:30]  Wow  Someone should get fired for this  Yeah  How dare they make that  Decision  Ugh  But that's all this other story  They don't say who  What  We got a little more  Yeah who said it  Yeah a little more  Was it a complaint  Or was it just some  Douchey airline employee  Yep  And they said  In that audio  I mean she's dressing like  Any other woman  Of her age  Yep  That has a hot body  That's how they're dressing  Exactly  Yeah people can wear sweats  And look like swabs  So I mean it's not like  There's really a  Business attire on planes anymore 
[01:23:00]  It's not in the 50s anymore  So it's a little different  Fortunately  That's how people dress these days  That's where people dress  Everywhere  Like that  So unless there's signs posted  Then how would she know  Others think Southwest  Is being inappropriate  But it's a discrimination  For Southwest to say  You can't fly  You have to go home and change  Yes  Yes  I don't think it's appropriate  For Southwest to tell somebody  How they dress  Is there some sort of code  As to how short your skirt  Is supposed to be  And how low your top  Is supposed to be 
[01:23:30]  And how short your sleeves are  And the proper footwear  And where are those rules  In buying a ticket  Yeah exactly  How about this  How about you  You spend time  Looking for the people  Wink wink  We all know  You should be looking at  When they get on a plane  Yes  How about that  Right  And leave the hot  Exactly  How about that  The only problem I'd have  If she was wearing that  If she was also wearing  The pilot's cap  Then I'd have a problem  Anything else  No problem  I think the stewardess  Should be forced to dress like that  The stews 
[01:24:00]  I'm sick of old fat stews  Where  Get the young ones  Like back in the 50s  When they were trying to get  People to fly  Getting those sexy stews on there  Remember  Come on and fly me  In the big blue sky  Where national fly  National airlines  Everybody  Come on  Come on and fly me  Together we'll fly  Hi I'm national  No?  Will you leave your house  Please? 
[01:24:30]  No that's  That's the song he was saying to himself  While violence was happening around him  Why don't you fly?  I don't hear it  International  Just leave your house  There's a world out there  Waiting to be explored  Come on  National airlines  Been out of business  For 30 years  Exactly  So how do you know the jingle?  I don't know  It's stuck in my head  Because there were cute girls  That would walk around  And go fly me  Yeah  Remember  Like girls would come up  And this was their ad 
[01:25:00]  Girls would be walking up the stairway  Wasn't even a jetway  They'd walk up the stairs from the tarmac  And the girl would have like a short skirt on  The cute little sexy stew outfit  And she'd turn around and go  I'm Christy  Fly me  And it was pretty much F me  That's the face she would make  And the whole attitude  And it was like fly me  That was a selling point  Can we get that jingle?  And now it's like  Now it's 
[01:25:30]  The girl's skirt is too  I know it's great  Southwest Airlines  Hostess's  Hot pants ad  From 1972  Oh there you go  You can go to YouTube  And check them out  Airline ads were very provocative  Back in the 70s  For some reason  They really wanted to  Make you feel like  You were going to get laid up there  Or something  I don't know  Can we get somebody from Southwest?  Can we call them?  Maybe see if we can get them  Yeah  If they'll talk about it  Danny what do you got?  Well there's  A hangover?  Besides that  Besides the obvious  Who had made 
[01:26:00]  Cirrhosis  It was indeed  A male flight attendant  Who was offended  Ah there you go  The manly  Male flight attendant  And it's just coming in  His name  Fez  Hey  Fez was offended  Apparently she asked him  What part of her outfit  Was offensive  And he said  He simply said  The whole thing  Well the whole thing  Is what he meant  It was probably  White after Labor Day issue 
[01:26:30]  Stupid fruit  If you spelt it out  In the transcript  There wouldn't be a W  In front of the word  Hey this is coming in a lot  So it's gotta be true  Very good  The whole  Very good  Fly  Fly  National  Yeah  Alright get the audio  So we can play for it  Fly Maggie  What?  Sean  Maggie  Fly Maggie  Fly National  How old is this plane?  What is that a right flyer?  No kidding  Fly Gwynadier  That's Maggie 
[01:27:00]  Maggie  Well Maggie's now  60 something  Great  Yes  But look  She's got  She's a bitch  She put on her F eyes  Yeah  Alright  I'm Maggie  Fly me  She's standing in front  Of some trees  Some shrubbery  Yeah  Hippie chick  Sean  Sean  Yeah I know  That's why I said Sean  Don't be nervous  You're only talking to  Maybe a mill  Maybe a mill  At this point in time  Well I gotta hurry up  Because I want to hear myself  On the radio  Alright go ahead  Hurry  When they 
[01:27:30]  Saw the  Or they showed  What she was wearing  On Matt Lauer  And when she sat back down  You got a total crotch shot  Good  This is coming in a lot  She was on  The Today Show  And she was sitting  With the outfit she had on  Yeah  And you got to see  Little panties  Oh panties though  Panties are nothing  Well cause she was sitting  And they're interviewing her  And you know  You got a nice crotch shot  But on a plane  A male flight attendant  Ought to calm the hell down  On a plane you don't get  Crotch shots anyway  How about Southwest  Stops being such cheapskates 
[01:28:00]  And gives blankets  To people who are flying  If they don't  And you can cover it up  With a blanket  Yeah  How about that  How about that  A couple of blankies  Let's go to the  Can't even get a blanket anymore  No no no  A continental does get blankets  Yes they do  And they have pillows  So don't lump them in  With every other  So does American  By the way  Of course they do  They're a major  Yes  They give you  Yes United gives blankie too  Yeah they give you blankets  But they're filled with semen  Don't think that plastic wrapping thing 
[01:28:30]  Is some sterilizing technique  I've seen a few curly cues  Pulled out of those  Out of those blankets  Out of the matting  Of those blankets  Who are you kidding  Hope they got that  Down the hall  I don't know if they need to  No that's perfectly fine  Alright here's the rest of the audio  The company issued this statement  Saying Southwest Airlines  Has a responsibility  To ensure the comfort  Of all our customers  When a concern is brought  To one of our employees  Attention we will address  That situation directly  With the customers 
[01:29:00]  Involved  In a discreet  And professional manner  But the question is  Where is the line  If I don't like  Your Hawaiian shirt  Do I tell the  Southwest Airlines guy  To tell you to go home  And change  Southwest says  They do not have  A dress code  Why does  Hot broads  Make people uncomfortable  It makes male  Flight attendants uncomfortable  You know what  When I'm flying  Your fatness  Makes me uncomfortable  I agree  To get off the effing plane  I don't like your fatness  Here's what happens  Especially when I'm  Sitting next to you  I'll spell it right out 
[01:29:30]  For you  Some guy  That the male  Flight attendant  Might have found  Attractive  Came onto the plane  And when this woman  Walked on  The male flight attendant  Noticed that that guy  Was eyeballing this girl  Like oh  And he felt threatened  He said  I wanted to spend  My flight  Taking care of  This gentleman  And trying to  Convert him  Or  Or somebody complained 
[01:30:00]  Like they're gonna  Let her on the plane  With that  Like someone complained  To the flight attendant  Or he took it on himself  But if someone complained  It was just some  Soccer mom  Or some fatty  Yeah  Soccer in the face  I say  Hey Chris from Houston  It says my grandma  My grandma used to be  A sky whore  Chris what's up  Sky whore  Your grandma was  A sky whore  Well actually  It was my wife's  Grandmother  Back in  I think it was  Like the late 60's 
[01:30:30]  Or early 70's  I've seen pictures of it  But yeah  She's got like  These little  Short shorts  Like hot pants  Go-go boots  And it almost  Looked like  Fishnet stockings  That's what it was  All about  And dude  The stories  They would tell  About them going out  With the pilots  Like they would  Finish their runs  And land in some city  All go to the hotel  And drink  And just have sex  It's amazing  Just an amazing way  Of life back then  Alright 
[01:31:00]  Well I don't know  About the sex  But  I've heard about it  I've known some  Old stewardesses  Old stews  Old stews  Go find some of those  Old commercials  Where they're sexing it up  I want to hear  Some of these now  I used to be  A stewardess  I've heard some stories  Wait your ex  Mother-in-law  Was that  Believe me  Was a sky whore  Not necessarily  Saying it was her  I'm just saying  Somebody with a  Boston accent  Oh my  Oh I'll play  That's what I'm saying  Wow okay  And I may have  Heard a couple  Of stories  About the party

[01:53:00]  bravo, El Vazo, El Vazo, Jimmy is furious, I'm just disgusted with publicists, the excuses 
[01:53:30]  that they make, just tell us, look, we don't want our people on your show, we would respect  you if you said that, when they want to promote their awful projects on the phone, and Danny  DeVito is going to be apparently in studio for CW11, I asked Roland, he goes, well, they  said he's just doing TV, I'm sick of hearing he's just doing TV, I'm sick of hearing that, 
[01:54:00]  he wasn't just doing TV when he was promoting whatever he was promoting, and he called in,  he said he's going to come back, come in studio, couldn't get him in studio because he had a  problem on The View, he was drunk, yeah, yesterday he's on The View again, and then today he's  doing this show, it's like they're all liars, the publicists are liars, and that's their  job, stink, uh, Roland, what's up, they're liars, I mean, it's just like scheduling,  I mean, your publicist passed on us three times, it's just like scheduling for certain 
[01:54:30]  people, it just, it's not scheduling though, that made perfect sense, I have the advantage,  I mean, that made no sense, I'm on the road, so I do promotion, not like he does, but I  do enough promotion to understand that when you have X amount of things set up, you can  get in, he could get in here, it's absolutely possible.  In the defense though, there's a riot strike that is happening, so a lot of them are filming  and rescheduling the whole event.  Absolutely.  Are they though?  Yes.  I get that, but that's not what's happening with him. 
[01:55:00]  See, if he couldn't come in because, no, no, he's right now, he really is in LA shooting  because they're away with the riot, that's different, no one's saying that they should  fly in, but like, Ben Kingsley, uh, cancels to do, and they all do it in that show.  And his movie bombed by the way.  Good, good, good for him.  Or like, some of them though, they only have, they're in town for like 10 hours, and they  just do straight TV, then they fly right out.  I understand if they gotta do Regis or Good Morning, but that's not the case here.  Like, that's a good, that's like saying, well, they're only doing, you know, they're doing  Conan, alright, but we're not competing with Conan, so they can do both. 
[01:55:30]  The publicists are just liars.  I love all publicists.  I don't, I don't like them, I don't respect them.  Liars.  Why?  Why should we take any of their people?  They lie.  Yeah, we don't need them.  No.  We really don't.  We don't need anybody.  That's right.  We do our own thing.  That's right.  Terrence Howard cancels on us, and you know what?  His movie stunk.  But he didn't give publicity for anything.  Good, he shouldn't have, it was awful.  Richard Gere's in there probably doing publicity for it. 
[01:56:00]  Talk about how poignant it is, stupid.  That movie stunk.  Which one?  I don't remember the name, I blocked it out like it was a childhood episode.  Uh, Roland?  The Hunting Party.  The Hunting Party.  Why are you whispering?  And, wait, you just whispered on her.  That came out?  Today.  Oh, good.  Okay, go see it today.  Yeah, pretty much.  If you want your date to sleep with you, go see The Hunting Party, because she'll pass  out 20 minutes into it.  You saw it?  I went to the premiere.  Oh, how was it? 
[01:56:30]  I've seen better.  And I like The Weinstein Company.  I think Harvey Weinstein is brilliant.  I love him.  This movie, I didn't like.  I hear it's kind of a fun buddy movie.  No.  No.  There's nothing fun about it.  No?  We gotta move on.  We got lots to do before we get off the air here.  We got Space Show Lendover.  Andrew from Brooklyn on the line.  Andrew!  Hi.  What's up, Andrew?  Where have you been?  Andrew, how you been?  Huh?  I'm fine. 
[01:57:00]  How was your trip?  It was great.  Where'd you go?  I just went to the Caribbean.  Oh, you did?  Anthony went to the Caribbean.  Where in the Caribbean did you go?  I can't tell.  Oh, right.  He can never tell these things.  Why?  Because your parents will get mad?  Probably, yes.  You could tell.  No one really knows who you are.  You could tell what country you were in. 
[01:57:30]  Uh, I'm sorry.  I really, I really don't want to, I really don't want to get my mom and dad mad.  No, no.  It wouldn't get them mad just to say what country.  Was it the Bahamas?  No.  Okay.  Was it St. Thomas?  It was St. Thomas, wasn't it? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, it was St. Thomas.  How was St. Thomas?  Isn't St. Thomas beautiful?  No, that was not St. Thomas.  All right.  Was it St. Martin?  Antigua.  Antigua.  All right.  That place is nice.  Uh, so you went down there.  And, uh, who did you go with?  My parents.  Oh, you went with your parents.  And what are their names?  Uh, I'm not allowed to tell.  I'm not allowed to tell. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, that I wouldn't tell.  Andrew, how old are you again?  I'm 14.  14.  How's school?  Fine.  Fine.  What, did you just start again after a nice summer vacation?  Yes.  Um, we go back on Mondays for our first day of classes.  What's your favorite subject, Andrew?  Um, history.  History.  Give us a little history.  What do you know about history?  Give us something interesting. 
[01:59:00]  Well, um, there's, we have been served by 42 presidents.  What did you say?  What's been what?  We've been served by 42 presidents.  Oh, 42 presidents.  Of these United States.  Well, that's pretty good.  That's, uh, that's history, all right.  Do you have a fun fact today?  Yeah.  Give us a fun fact, uh, that's, uh, based in history.  Besides the president thing.  Um, well, Wolverine was the only United States president to have served two terms. 
[01:59:30]  Wait, I, I, hold on a second.  What was the guy's first name?  Grover Cleveland.  And what, what did he, he served?  Two consecutive.  Wait, wait, say it again.  Two terms.  They were not in succession.  As in, two terms.  They did not come, like, one term, and then the term, the next term came right after that one. 
[02:00:00]  But what's the word you used, in what, in, in successful?  In succession.  Oh.  Oh, right, right.  In succession, right.  So that, wow, that is a fun fact.  Okay.  I like that.  Wait, there's something I gotta ask you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Like, so wait, you gave, what price, wait, do you have any money prizes?  Money prizes?  Why?  Are you a little strapped for cash there, uh, Andrew? 
[02:00:30]  Um, a little bit.  A little bit?  What do you need money for?  You're, you're just a kid.  Uh, I just want to get some.  What do you want to get?  Cool.  Something cool for myself.  Like what?  What's cool for yourself?  Yeah, what do you want to get?  Um, I just need some money for some future use.  For future use?  Wait, what, what's the most amount of money you're gonna give? 
[02:01:00]  Two hundred thousand.  Well, it all depends.  If you give your, uh, mom's name, we'll give you how much, Andrew?  Ten bucks.  We'll start low.  Uh, look, I, we gotta know what you're gonna use this money for if we do indeed ever give  money out.  Right.  We don't, we don't usually give money gifts, uh, uh, to people, but, uh, what would you  use money for?  Um, probably get some new techno gadget. 
[02:01:30]  A techno gadget?  Like what?  What do you, what do you like?  What kind of, uh, toys?  Someone's suggesting that, um, Andrew needs money for future endeavors.  Ah.  Barry from Pittsburgh.  Uh, what kind of gadgetry?  Uh, probably a DSLR.  A what?  A what?  A DSLR. 
[02:02:00]  DSLR?  Hello?  Someone's suggesting he needs some money for speech lessons, but.  What is a DSLR?  What, what is it, Andrew?  A DSLR.  What is that?  A digital single reflex, single lens reflex camera.  Oh, oh.  What do you want to take pictures of? 
[02:02:30]  A DSLR.  Yeah, what do you want to take pictures of there?  Um, I, I, I'm not, I, I don't really want to suppose my, my hobbies because it will, it  will sound boring.  No, it's fine.  Hobbies are very cathartic.  Yeah.  Sometimes they are a little bit boring, but that's okay.  What do you like to take pictures of?  Uh, like, surrounding, uh, okay, never, I'll call you back in a future time. 
[02:03:00]  Bye.  Wait, wait, wait, Andrew.  Andrew.  We want to know what your hobby is.  Um, I like, I just like photographs.  What?  You like what?  Photographs, she said.  Yeah, but what do you take pictures of?  I love photography.  Uh, it's a, it's a boring, you, you, you guys could find us a boring hobby.  No, you won't.  I love photography.  Yeah.  What do you like taking pictures of?  Yeah.  Give, give us a little insight.  Probably, like, like, like, I go around certain places, and, I, okay, I just take, um, oh, boy, 
[02:03:30]  I just, this is, this hobby, you guys could find a super boring.  No, we won't.  Not at all.  I don't want to be an age to look at cameras today, actually.  Yeah.  You have to tell us what you like taking pictures of.  Yeah.  Just, just tell us, please, Andrew. 
[02:04:00]  Guys?  Yeah.  Uh, I'll, I'll, I'll tell you, I'll tell you in a future time.  Just tell us.  Wait, wait, but before you go, just tell us what you like to take pictures of.  Yeah, you're looking for.  Then you can hang up, and we'll see you next time.  Airplanes.  Airplanes.  Wait, okay.  Wait, how much money, wait, can you, how, can you guys get, like, you guys have, like,  $2,000? 
[02:04:30]  Two G's, huh?  What is it you want to buy?  Airplanes.  He wants to buy his camera.  You know, that's a very dangerous hobby.  They don't like it.  They don't like when you take pictures of airplanes.  They don't like you taking pictures of airplanes, Andrew.  What kind of camera are you looking for?  RPG.  Actually, that's not my hobby.  That's not my hobby.  What is it?  Be honest.  What do you need two grand for?  Huh?  What do you need to?  Be honest.  What do you need $2,000 for? 
[02:05:00]  I'll probably get a laptop.  A laptop.  A laptop, huh?  All right.  No, okay.  Never mind about this.  I'll call back.  I'll call back in future time.  In future time.  All right.  You keep in touch with us.  All right, Andrew?  Okay.  Never mind about this.  All right.  I'll call you back.  Never mind.  We should just forget it.  Ever happened?  Okay.  Wipe it from our memory, everybody.  So you don't want the government knowing that you take pictures of airplanes, right? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Um, no, I'm not, I'm not into airplanes.  I don't really photograph airplanes.  No, of course not.  All right.  Why don't you, why don't you, uh, go about your day there, Andrew?  Where are your parents right now?  Yeah.  Where are your parents?  We need to talk to them.  Um, mom, um, I, they don't want to talk now, just, they're pop, they're, um, our father's  at work and mom is sleeping. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, she's sleeping?  You want to wake her up?  You want to play a cool game called Wake Up Mommy?  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  No, thanks.  Bye.  All right.  Wake up.  Oh, he hung up.  He is so paranoid.  Wow.  Wow.  I think he really does like taking pictures of airplanes.  Yeah.  And it is an innocent, we scared him a little.  And it is an innocent hobby, you know, but now we got him paranoid.  Great.  He likes planes.  He's not going to be calling back anytime soon.  Hey, before we leave this side of the show, we got to talk about the ninja burglar. 
[02:06:30]  This is a really, uh, really interesting story.  Ninja.  Yeah.  We got a ninja burglar out there.  Yeah.  He truly is a ninja, I think.  Yeah.  Man.  Because I, I listen to what, what happened to, uh, this guy and wow.  Yeah.  When you first come into your kitchen in the middle of the night and you see a guy dressed  up like a ninja, what was going on in your head?  What the F is this?  Yeah.  That's what you would say.  If you walked into your kitchen in the middle of the night and you saw a man staring at you  dressed like a ninja and armed with nunchucks. 
[02:07:00]  He hit me right here.  And he hit me in the back of the head.  What's going through my mind is this guy's a maniac.  He's going to try and kill me.  I thought he was advancing.  Right, right.  Can you imagine, though, waking up in the middle of the night, you go to your kitchen, there's  a guy dressed in full ninja...  Ninja attire.  Attire?  Well, the guy got in through a door.  I don't know what, open door? 
[02:07:30]  Did he bash the door in?  Ah, I hate these home invasions.  Phil Sciolo says the intruder whacked him with the weapon on his shoulder blade.  Phil says he fell onto his counter when the burglar bashed him in the back of the head.  That's when he reached for a steak knife.  The burglar bungled the burglary by falling over this chair.  And just as the home invader was about to take a third swing, the victim seized the opportunity  to be victorious.  I picked up a steak knife about that long.  And that's when I stabbed him in the chest with a knife.  I got him right here. 
[02:08:00]  And basically what happened was he got up with the handles sticking out of him and ran  out the door.  Hospitals are on alert right now because this burglar is walking around with a stab wound  right around here.  If you have any information about this nuisance who could be dressed up like a ninja, call  Crimestoppers.  Damn, you've just been pwned.  I think he's more than a nuisance, by the way.  Yeah, they call him a nuisance.  Isn't a nuisance like a mosquito? 
[02:08:30]  A guy dressed up as a ninja walking around your house in the middle of the night is more  than a nuisance.  Oosh.  Oh, that's funny, Anthony.  By the way, someone's suggesting that Andrew's mom is forever sleeping.  Oh, you think the bottom half might be rotted away?  That would be Richard Manhattan.  His mom is forever sleeping and his dad is dead in his car.  Oh, God.  That's not very nice.  We're running out of show, unfortunately.  Oh, there's that music. 
[02:09:00]  We didn't mention the things that women's lib ruined.  Oh, you got a few, Jimmy?  Just a couple thoughts.  All right, Jimmy.  Women's lib has ruined the toilet scrubbing industry, voting, Jake LaMotta's right hook,  and snuff films.  That's what women's lib has spoiled.  There you go.  We got to get off the air.  Someone is pissed off at my brother because he's getting married on opening day for football.  Ah.  That he should have waited for like a bye week for like, you know, the Jets.  Yeah.  Because, you know, we're here in the New York area. 
[02:09:30]  Yep.  And this guy's bitching at my brother, and he's not even invited to the wedding,  but he thinks it's really not a cool thing to do to get married on opening day of football season.  Is there going to be people at the wedding, you think, listening?  Taking a peek at the old TV in another room?  Yeah.  I'm sure we'll be doing that.  Hey, tonight, I guess, oh boy, I guess you're invited to my brother's bachelor party at FH Riley's.  Oh, wow.  Where is that?  400 New York Avenue in Huntington.  Huntington Village. 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  Oos.  Yes.  And then, I don't know, if you're a babe and you're on a boat, you might find us way out  east, somewhere around Orient Point, fishing with really bad hangovers tomorrow morning.  Yeah, that's some smart planning.  Find my other brother.  Yeah, get seasick.  Oh, man, hungover on a boat out in Orient Point.  Good luck.  Snark fishing chum.  Yeah.  Well, we'll be smelling some fish tonight as well.  Oosh. 
[02:10:30]  Yes.  Hey, guys, have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Later, man.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Just got a communique from my brother.  What?  A communique?  Huh?  Well, I can't. 
[02:11:00]  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.  Let's watch The Panic.  Because I can't find my headphones.  I don't know where my headphones went.  Are you kidding?  They were here for a show that we did, oh, God.  A mere 15 minutes ago.  15 minutes ago.  Oh, I don't know where.  Is that them right over there?  How did...  Why is his headphones gone?  Where did they go?  Ah, where were they?  Right there.  They were in front of you the whole time.  What's wrong with you?  No, they were not. 
[02:11:30]  They were right there.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Is that turned up?  Is that...  Will you just freaking put your headphones on?  We got a broadcast.  Is that all fucked up now?  There we go.  We gots the broadcast.  That's better.  So, um...  Handle that very smoothly.  The big bachelor party's happening at FH Riley's tonight in the heart of Huntington Village,  400 New York Avenue out there on Long Island.  And then my brother Scott, there's a major problem happening within my family the last couple  of days.  Why?  My brother Quinn, you know, wants to just rock FH Riley's tonight. 
[02:12:00]  His twin brother's getting married, so he wants to rock and get fucked up.  All right?  Yeah.  Do some of that drinking.  And then you got Scott, who lives way out east, and he's got four kids.  Oh, boy.  He wants to go on a fishing trip tomorrow morning.  See, it's not working out here.  There's a conflict there.  I even...  Last night at the rehearsal dinner, I'm like, Scott, realistically,  this is what's going to happen.  You're going to get a lot of phone calls from a lot of brothers saying, 
[02:12:30]  I'm not making it.  Mm-hmm.  Because just for the rest of the country, FH Riley's in Huntington is about two hours  away from where Scott wants to take off to do a little fishing.  And guess what time he wants the boat to leave?  Well, your fishing always starts early.  He wants to leave, and this is him pushing it at 8.30 in the morning.  That's late.  So we would have to leave Huntington around 6.30 in the morning after being at FH Riley's  pretty much all night tonight. 
[02:13:00]  Why would you do that?  Is he insane?  That's terrible.  And then he's like, all right, I could push it to 9.  I'm like, no.  You push it to 1 in the afternoon.  Look, I'll throw in my two cents here.  And if we don't see any fucking fish, we don't see any fucking fish.  I'll throw in my two cents here.  Who wants to be in a boat hungover?  It's a bachelor party.  You do a bachelor party thing.  You party.  It's at night.  You do that.  The fishing thing, you could do at some point.  Fishing sucks.  Nobody wants to fish on a bachelor party day after.  It's too...  You'll be queasy. 
[02:13:30]  You have to nurse your hangovers, then go to lunch and eat a fish that somebody else  sat like a douche in the drizzle for.  There's no reason to do that.  You have to put your fish in there.  But here's the weird thing.  My brother Brett, it's his bachelor party, but it's at his restaurant, so he's not going  to fully be able to enjoy himself.  He will to a point.  Someone else better take the reins over there.  So then this is like a way of giving him something else before the big marriage on Sunday.  So now I've got to communicate for my brother Scott with the four kids, who's obviously 
[02:14:00]  not going to make it to FH Riley's, right?  Obviously.  He wouldn't plan this if he was coming tonight.  He's got to come tonight.  He should go get a room and stay.  Says, G, put out an announcement for an aquatic visual candy.  For aquatic visual candy for Brett.  Because, see, we can't really have strippers tonight at FH Riley's because we don't have  the cabaret license, so we still need to get some girlies involved because it's the bachelor  party. 
[02:14:30]  So now Scott's idea is an aquatic visual candy treat for Brett.  Did you think that you're going to get girls on the water who are just going to flash while  you're fishing?  Off of Orient Point?  At 8 in the morning.  Maybe somewhere like at the, I don't know, one of the marinas out there, Watch Hill.  The Great South Bay.  Around Great South Bay.  Huntington, the harbor in there, you get something.  North Port.  But they're too busy trying to catch jaws out there in Orient Point. 
[02:15:00]  Off of Orient Point.  The water.  The shipwrecks out there.  The water is like, you ever watch Deadliest Catch?  Right.  Right.  It's not like people are sunning.  That's like fishermen area.  On the front of their luxury freaking, you know, water.  There's a young woman laying out in the sun on the front of the boat as she's being tossed  in 20 foot seas.  What does he think?  That Quincy has his boat out there at Orient Point?  Touching a flat ass.  Right.  Da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[02:15:30]  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Sam, I think her ass was eaten off by a flicking virus.  Wait, I'm so pleased.  Ha-ha, Quincy's stupid boat.  This is like a soap opera.  So, so Scott writes, because he's not going to be at FH, it's obvious, put out an announcement  for aquatic visual candy for Brett.  Gotta be mermaids.  We'll be cruising out of Flanders Bay and headed up to-  Hey, stupid Flanders.  And headed up to East Hampton by late morning. 
[02:16:00]  If any listeners will be out on the water.  Drowning?  We'll hook up with them, provided they have hotties on board.  Hotties?  My brothers are losing their minds.  I just gotta say, your brother's, because he's got four kids, he's probably a very good  family man.  He's a little out of touch with the way women are going to behave.  Where hotties are.  Hotties.  Gathering.  Yeah, you're not going to get a gathering of hotties.  See, hotties have been drinking and getting deep-dicked on Friday night. 
[02:16:30]  They're passed out.  Hotties are land-based.  Any girl that is up at 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning-  That's right.  Ah, she doesn't get many dates, so she's like, what the hell, I might as well get up and  do some chores.  She'll be wearing-  Yeah.  The hotties, you're right, are trying to figure out how to get all the sperm out of their hair  before they take the walk of shame back to their apartment.  Because they were too embarrassed to take a shower at the place.  Not a one boat.  Never mind girls.  They probably won't see another boat. 
[02:17:00]  That is going to be-  What does he think it is?  I don't know.  Does he think it's the scene of an officer and a gentleman?  Like, a bunch of girls are going to drive by and we'll yell, ooh, ooh, and moon.  Hey!  Moon, yeah.  Yeah, it's a party out there off of Orient Point.  Can we get the great Brett Hughes on the phone, please?  Oh, he's right.  What did your brothers get married?  There are shipwrecks out there.  There are shipwrecks.  There are shipwrecks.  There are shipwrecks.  And my brother's looking for hotties at 8.30 in the morning after a Friday night? 
[02:17:30]  Is Orient Point near the Hamptons?  Oh, it's so far.  Well, we've got-  It's two forks.  That's the North Fork.  People know what Long Island looks like.  It looks like a fish.  And the back end of Long Island looks like the fins of the fish.  And it's the top fin.  It's the point of the top fin, which pretty much goes out into the North Atlantic.  Right, right.  So it's real ocean that he's next to.  Yes.  And the water is really cold.  Yeah, real cold water. 
[02:18:00]  Really cold.  It's an awful, awful place.  How far is it from Manhattan?  Oh, God.  By boat or what?  You probably want to go east to get to Manhattan.  It's quicker.  Honestly, without traffic from here to Orient Point would take you at least two hours.  That's without traffic.  Doing like a good clip.  A good clip, right?  Oh, my God.  Labor Day weekend, do you think, on a Friday afternoon?  Labor Day weekend, Friday.  Two and a half hours?  Leave right now for next Labor Day weekend.  It would be probably five hours.  You know how you're talking about crying in traffic? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Five hours.  You'll be dehydrated from all the crying you do.  I would say five hours.  So, and I've got to get to the bottom of this because we can't party all night at  FH and then go fishing first thing tomorrow morning.  We just can't do that.  That's a silly thing to do.  Right.  Don't even try.  Huh?  Don't even try that.  Well, I've got to get Brent on the phone if hopefully he'll answer.  Because then you're going to have two things done half-assed because you'll be thinking  we've got to go fishing tomorrow, can't get wild, and then you're going to ruin the 
[02:19:00]  party part of it, and then the fishing's going to be ruined because you're going to  be all hungover anyway.  Right.  So, just go with the party.  Right.  We know what you want to do.  We know what your brother Quinn wants to do.  Well, Quinn is the party animal.  Quinn could drink all night and he'll be just the chipper one on the boat tomorrow morning.  Well, he doesn't want to go to the boat.  He's that type of guy.  He's not for the boat, is he?  Yeah.  He's up for everything.  He's always been up for everything.  That guy is an animal.  So, Quinn wants to go on the boat. 
[02:19:30]  I'm a loser, man.  A few drinks and I'm not getting up for a boat trip.  Brent's somewhere in the middle, I believe.  Let them go.  Have fun.  And then Elmo has already said, brother Elmo said, fuck that.  I'm a night owl.  I'm not doing the boat thing.  He's just going to look for some big hairy muff.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, yeah.  Now I can say, my brother loves that hairy snatch.  Earlier today, during the other portion of the program, we were talking about the girl  from High School Musical.  Yeah.  And how they've got naked pictures of her now.  Let me see if my brother Scott wrote back. 
[02:20:00]  And I kind of like her natural triangle bush.  Yeah.  But we were talking about how you guys think it's too wide.  That's where I'm moving.  She doesn't shave it.  And we found out that Elmo, through Opie, said that Elmo likes big hairy fucking big  hairy bush.  The hairier the better.  The hairier the better joke, man.  He doesn't want it trimmed at all?  He's sleeping.  I would love to get him.  When he eats muff, he looks like an honest Abe.  Right.  Hey, someone's pushing for the line of the day for the Opster. 
[02:20:30]  The hotties are too busy getting sperm out of their hair.  That is a good one.  Thank you, Fatty McButterpants.  And true.  So.  I'll just stick a tissue up my nose.  Straight to voicemail.  We've got to get Brett on the phone so we can find out what's going on.  Someone call Brett.  Hi.  Please.  That would be awful.  How about call the restaurant?  I hate it.  Just sit there and hope a fucking thing swims up.  I think I got a nibble. 
[02:21:00]  I felt a nibble.  All right.  Give a little give on the line.  Have a little give.  All right.  Set the hook.  Both of those.  It's fucking dumb fishing.  You lost your bait.  I was always losing my bait.  And then you'd sit there not knowing when you lost your bait.  Could have been the second the hook hit the water.  And you were sitting there for half an hour with a hook.  With no bait on it.  Just being useless.  You know what though?  You didn't actually lose the bait.  What happened?  It was in another man's mouth.  What? 
[02:21:30]  Just a call back.  Because you would like wiggle the bait.  All right.  From the other thing.  You got to wiggle the bait to catch the fish.  Right.  Yes.  Listen.  We got some dude from Port Jeff.  He knows a little bit about fishing.  Port Jeff is a nautical city.  Douche Nozzle would like to know if Elmo also likes smell.  Smelly cunts.  Jesus douche.  Good question.  Does he like a scented vag?  Are you suggesting that if a vag is very hairy that it probably is smelly? 
[02:22:00]  It can be because hair will trap to sweat more.  You're much more likely to stink.  That's what I'm going to say.  It's much more likely to stink.  Now with the bush from the high school musical girl, that doesn't look like it's thick enough.  I know, but it's too wide though, man.  It's just awful.  The wideness is what bothers me.  Hey, really fast, because the instant feedback is going to update and fuck this up.  That's a nude girl.  And real fast, John B. from Port Jeff, he knows the thing about fishing. 
[02:22:30]  He says, it's the fucking outer continental shelf.  The ocean drops off to nothingness.  No one but dirty fishermen will be out there.  There's going to be no fucking hotties for you guys to look at.  Thank you, John B.  People that go out there, their names end up on plaques that crying families visit every year.  But Scott insists that the hotties show up.  What?  In between?  The hotties showed up at a quarter to eight.  Yeah, the hotties are going to show up in between trying to catch fish that are see-through. 
[02:23:00]  Fish with lights on their head.  Right.  Poor Elmo.  He likes a cunt that looks like Rick Rubin's mouth and smells like a chum bucket.  That was great.  I know Elmo went to bed.  He's usually up listening to the show live, but he can't even defend himself today.  I love it.  I love it.  You guys have had the brotherly discussions like that?  A couple of beers, and you go, you know what I like?  I like a big, hairy fucking cunt. 
[02:23:30]  I don't get that.  And then the conversation just stops.  I'm kind of surprised.  I'm kind of surprised a few of the brothers when that one came out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone was in agreement.  I don't see anything wrong with that right there.  I won't even look at it.  It's not like if she shaved it, it wouldn't be great or even better.  I'm not saying that.  Don't mistake what I'm saying.  Look, it's this big zoom up.  I'm not going to look.  No, no.  Now it's zoomed.  It's zoomed way in.  I'm more turned on looking at Richard Gere's glasses. 
[02:24:00]  No, you're not.  I wouldn't be that fucking patch.  Speaking of Richard Gere, look at the gerbil in her lap.  That's nice.  Look.  She has nice legs.  What's wrong with it?  It's a naturally shaped, very thin hair.  It's not big, thick, matted hair.  I will say this.  There's nothing wrong with that bush.  I got a massage one time from a girl.  It was an Esalon massage.  A what?  Esalon, which is typically you're both nude.  What the fuck word is Esalon for both being nude? 
[02:24:30]  What is this being nude massage or something?  But the girl had...  Wait, is it an official thing?  You could get an Esalon?  Well, it's a California-based thing.  I don't think it's legal for both to be nude in this country.  I mean, I'm sorry, this is a state.  Right.  But the girl had a hairy pussy like that.  It wasn't a mess, but she had natural hair.  And it was sexy to look at.  I'll say because I'm so used to seeing bald shaved pussies.  That's obviously a while ago.  That it was kind of a nice switch.  But that said, I knew I wasn't going to have to put my face in it consistently. 
[02:25:00]  Maybe once, I would fucking, you know, I'd lap at it.  You eat ass.  More than most people eat breakfast.  But I'm saying, is it a problem with the look?  Is it a problem with the smell that you think emanates from hairy pussies?  Or is it eating bush like that?  I like fucking big lips in my mouth.  I don't like the way hair feels.  I want nothing.  That's why I like an asshole. 
[02:25:30]  It's just smooth.  I want just, I like fucking big pronounced pussy lips.  And I like nothing blocking me from sucking the lips.  Okay.  I like to get the clit.  All of it.  I hate having to fucking move hair.  Fish around in there with a machete.  Yeah, it's just fucking annoying.  It's like, look, evolution chart pussy.  Get rid of this.  We don't need it.  I think you probably have a good point as far as the going down on a chick that has a  hairy bush like that.  Because you will be like, you know, there will be things that get going on. 
[02:26:00]  But I think that initial look, and I think it stems back to my youth and looking at like  Penthouse and Playboy from back then.  The girls all had bushes like that.  And of course, Buzz, when I pulled the sheets down, the first time I saw an actual, you know,  naked woman like that, forget about it.  You know.  Yeah.  That was the 70s.  Yeah.  So I'm talking, wow.  And all that hair hid the cock.  No, there was no cock there. 
[02:26:30]  That's preposterous that you would insinuate that the first woman that I was with had a cock.  She's pretty, man.  Hey, lots of instant feedback coming in.  I'm trying to get a brother on the phone.  I'm not having much luck, but.  Because none listened.  Steve from.  No, no.  He meant.  All one of his own.  Yeah, yes, yes.  Steve from Bayshore, who will be at the Bachelor Party tonight.  He's very white.  I saw some of his medals last night.  Yeah.  I think at this point, women are invited to the Bachelor Party, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, come on down, girls.  We need something to look at. 
[02:27:00]  Instead, it's going to be a bunch of guys standing around with some fucking beers in their  hand.  Let me just help out.  That's not a good selling point to get women down.  Women are invited because we need something to look at.  Yeah.  How about ladies come on down?  A free drink.  Ah.  By the way, we are going to be a little red carpeting.  Not everyone's getting in.  Girls with short skirts get in.  Oh!  That's right.  You're going to set up a velvet rope?  That's right.  Like it.  But nice.  If you're wearing one of Elmo's shirts, you get in with.  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, E-Rock, you going?  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock's going.  All right, here.  Steve from Bayshore, he writes,  Heyo, tell Barnicle Scott, the sailor, to put off the maritime exploits and come party  at FH.  Barnicle Scott.  Come party at FH tonight.  Yeah, what the hell's he doing out there in the North Atlantic?  And then Matt from Queensry.  He's good for one.  You guys need a compromise.  Party and drink all night at FH Riley's.  Good.  So far.  Beat a prostitute to death.  Good.  Then in the morning, go out on the boat to throw her in the ocean. 
[02:28:00]  Dump her body.  There you go.  That's a good idea.  Or you drink all night.  Mm-hmm.  You fucking jam your hand up a chick's skirt.  And then in the morning, you smell your fingers.  And there's no difference between that and having been out on the boat, fishing around  for worms and fucking an occasional trout.  Your fingers stink and you're not seasick.  Go worship.  Welcome.  Wow.  Someone that listens very close to the show on the instant feedback.  He goes.  Oh, and Fishkin. 
[02:28:30]  He goes, will blank.  Trying to protect someone here.  Yeah.  Will blank be giving any more strippers strep throat?  Hmm.  Someone gave a strippers strep throat.  Yes.  I don't remember that one.  Hey, we talked about it on the air.  It's an old reference.  Uh, it was before a marriage.  Oh, well, then, you know, everything's fine.  And then you got Pat from Monaki.  He writes, uh...  Hey, hey, Pat. 
[02:29:00]  He writes, uh...  Hi, guys.  You can't stay up with the owls at night and soar with the eagles in the morning.  Ah.  And then he writes, yeah.  Truer words haven't been spoken, except you're a douche, Pat.  Yeah.  A lot of things you can't do.  Like, you can't be a good carrier pigeon when you're missing your claw.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Or a fucking hoof.  One talon.  Whatever piggings have.  Talon.  One talon is missing.  By the way, we're making rules to get into FH tonight.  If you've been fucked by Master Poe in the parking lot, you're not allowed in tonight. 
[02:29:30]  Holy cow.  No, that means you're a trooper.  Just making special, special rules.  Jesus Christ.  Right.  Hope, if you've been shallow dicked by Master Poe in the parking lot, you should be allowed in.  You absolutely should be allowed in because that means you're a goer.  He is, Poe.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  I like that.  I got no problem with fucking Master Poe giving some chick a mediocre fuck in the parking lot. 
[02:30:00]  Good boy.  A shallow dicking.  Damn, you've just been pwned.  Oos.  How does a girl know when he's about to come in her asshole?  Oos.  Poe.  And then, of course, after the oos. 
[02:30:30]  Damn, you've just been pwned.  And get out.  Yeah, let's...  Oh, my God.  That is funny.  Let's go to Scott in D.C.  Scott.  Hey, what's going on, guys, man?  What are you guys going out on the Elmo Fitzgerald tomorrow?  The Elmo Fitzgerald.  My brother.  It's hauling pubic hair across Lake Michigan.  I'm saying it, fellas.  It's too rough to feed you. 
[02:31:00]  My brothers are insane.  It's hauling another load of cunt hair.  At 7 p.m.  The main barber came in.  We're leaving from Flanders Bay.  Look on a map.  Where the hell is Flanders Bay?  Flanders Bay is out there.  Isn't that where the stupid duck was?  The duck Flanders duck?  I don't know.  So maybe it's not only a point where the shelf drops off to nothingness.  The shelf...  Oh, it just kind of goes deep, right?  Yes.  You know, the continental shelf. 
[02:31:30]  How far out is that?  It's pretty far.  No, no, no, no.  But how far out from the beach?  From land?  Yeah.  It varies, but I think if you go about...  A hundred yards.  A hundred yards.  Perhaps more than an open thing.  I would think out there it's probably a couple of miles before it really just drops off into  sheer nothingness and abyss that will gobble up anything.  But before it drops off, how deep is it?  It's still very deep.  How deep is it?  I'm not sure.  I don't care.  Probably a shelf.  It could be three, four feet. 
[02:32:00]  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  I love how people get creeped out over deepness, but anything over 5'11", in my case, is deep  enough.  Oosh.  Like, what's the difference between 20 feet of water and a mile straight down?  Thinking about it, though.  True.  When you think you have a mile below you, think if you're a mile in the sky.  That's scary.  No, no, I'm just telling you.  Can we get audio of that? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, we will.  Oh, no.  Hold on, hold on, because Dirty Joe...  Regis.  Dirty Joe, I got to give him a chance at the line of the day.  Uh-huh.  He writes, Elmo goes down on a chick and looks like the Geico caveman when he comes up.  All right, that's funny.  Brian from Jersey.  FH stands for fucking hurting too much to go fishing at 8 a.m.  No, FH is fucking hairy.  Yeah, that's what I'm...  A continental shelf is average of around 400 feet, so that's what you get. 
[02:33:00]  But then it drops off like, woof, woof, forget about it.  That's that titanic depth, you know?  We got someone from South Hold on the line, James.  South Hold for the rest of the country is very close to Orient Point.  What do you got, James?  It's out by where you go pick pumpkins there, Opie.  Hey, boys, the real Captain Clint, Frank Mundus, was out here last weekend showing off his boat that he caught Jaws from. 
[02:33:30]  It's probably about 60, 70 feet out before you hit the shelf.  60, 70 feet?  It's further than that.  No, no, no.  I mean, the water off Orient Point, it's probably 60, 70 feet where the ferries go off the most...  Oh, 60, 70 feet deep?  Yeah, yep.  Yeah.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Opie, there's a boat that takes you to Connecticut.  It's from Long Island, right?  Yeah.  How long a ride is that?  They got the speed jets over there.  They get you there in about 45 minutes.  From Long Island to Connecticut? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, but the problem is you got to drive all the way to the end of Long Island to get this.  I know.  So at that point, you might as well drive around.  This is so local.  Or you take an airplane.  Yeah.  That's all right.  We're entertaining even talking about local shit.  I think we are, too.  Oh, forget about it.  People love hearing this.  I believe.  We're just talking about fucking our...  How about those Long Island iced teas, huh?  Ah, hey, hey.  More than one.  Thank you, rest of the country.  Thank you.  More than one.  Forget about it.  Never got a thank you from anybody in, like, Michigan or somewhere going, Long Island iced 
[02:34:30]  tea.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Yeah, what did Michigan ever give us?  I've spent so many nights on my bathroom floor throwing up because of Long Island iced teas,  and I didn't even get a thank you.  Why don't you guys go to Gardner's Island?  What's that little island off Long Island?  Gardner's Island?  You didn't say Gardner's Island.  You don't want to go to Gardner's Island.  Actually, Plum Island is the bad one.  Yeah, Plum Island.  Where's Plum Island?  Oh, yeah.  Plum Island's where they...  That's the one they promised to take...  Hannibal Lecter?  To take Hannibal Lecter to.  Dude, they do animal testing on Plum Island. 
[02:35:00]  Gardner's Island's no treat, is it?  Wait, what's Gardner's Island all about?  Gardner's Island is off of more towards, like, Connecticut there.  I know where it is, and people could Google it, but what's the deal with Gardner's?  What do they do there?  All I know is there's a golf course there.  That's about it.  Is there?  Really?  My uncle works on Plum Island.  He's, like, the janitor guy out there.  Oh, great.  But that's where...  They're painted monkeys.  Which one does the animal testing where it's creepy?  Plum.  Every once in a while, you're in a boat, and you see this Plum Island, and there's really 
[02:35:30]  nothing on it, and it just looks creepy.  Plum Island.  It's creepy.  There's rain clouds over the island at all times.  Zoom in on Gardner's Island there.  As you're going off of Orient Point, the deers are swimming back across from Plum Island  full of diseases.  How far out is Plum Island, sir?  Not that far, Jim.  From Orient Point, maybe a mile.  Yeah, it's right there.  There ain't much there on Gardner's Island, huh?  As you're on the ferry going over to the casinos or New London, you go right next to it. 
[02:36:00]  Zoom in more.  And what's up with Gardner's Island?  Yeah, what is it?  What's there?  There's nothing there.  Why?  What the hell's there?  It's the year 2007.  Something should be there.  I want to build a comedy club.  Wow, imagine that.  Jimmy's joke nest.  Jason from Rye, Michigan is saying that Strong Island is for queers.  Ah.  Getting real local right now.  See?  We're upsetting people.  And a lot of Michigan people checking in. 
[02:36:30]  Asshole, Michigan gave you Stephen Lynch.  And Seinfeld.  And cars.  And fucking Rob Bartlett.  Yes.  And Opie.  Right.  And Anthony.  Me?  And Eddie Murphy.  Long Island gave you Eddie Murphy.  And fucking Keb Calloway.  And tell me what you want, Zebra.  Really?  Find Plum Island.  Twisted Sister.  You gotta go out further. 
[02:37:00]  He doesn't even know how to use Google Map.  I don't either, actually, because I can never zoom in that far at home.  Keep zooming out.  No, no, no.  What are you looking at the water for?  What are we going, ice fishing?  You know where Plum Island is?  Yes.  I was heading right there.  Is that it?  Why are you in Africa?  Zoom in on it.  You're in Africa.  Find what's on it.  I want to see if there's laboratories on it.  Yeah.  Find a laboratory.  That's right.  Laboratories.  A laboratory.  They're trying to close Plum Island. 
[02:37:30]  Why?  How do you close an island?  Because they're just going to make it go away, if you know what I mean.  Oh, is that the facility?  Look at that.  Look at that.  That's where the animal testing goes.  Go further.  That's right.  I want to see license plates.  Not enough security?  Who's going there?  That doesn't...  Hold on.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, buddy.  It's like a waste treatment plant.  That doesn't look like a good zoom in.  It looks like a fucking painting.  I know.  That's not a good zoom in.  It looks like a kindergarten doing some painting.  Yeah, it's horrible.  I want a better picture. 
[02:38:00]  I want to zoom in and see the teeth of a chimp as it's yelling, ow.  I want to see a chimp fucking yelling, ouch.  That's why I do the same joke twice.  Yeah, they do like anthrax testing out there, and they have all kinds of...  Oh, yeah.  It's all kinds of highly contagious animal diseases that they have out there, and they  do all kinds of experiments and testing with it.  So it's very dangerous.  I want to open a...  I want to open a... 
[02:38:30]  I want to open some sort of a lunch shack on Plum Island.  You want a Plum Island lunch shack?  Yes, I want to have a lunch truck.  It's a portable lunch shack truck that I go out there with every day at 2 o'clock for  lunch and snacks for the boys.  I want the only hot dog truck.  Yes, a hot dog truck right on that dirt road.  Right there.  At the end of the little spike there.  Look, keep going.  I want to be there.  My hot dog truck.  It's at the end of a little peninsula. 
[02:39:00]  That's right.  All of us exit 70 with five kids.  Oh, good call back.  I want to have just a push cart.  It's not even a truck.  It's a push cart with a bell where I sell snacks and chimp finger trinkets to people who work  there.  Would you have sauerkraut?  I would have...  It's going to be nothing but sauerkraut and Milky Way candy bars.  Get your Milky Way kraut treats.  And an infected severed monkey head on your aerial antenna. 
[02:39:30]  That's how you would advertise your hot dog truck.  Yeah.  The monkey teeth chatter.  As if I shake the cart over a rocky road.  All right, James.  We've got to let you go.  Bye, James.  All right, boys.  Be good.  I don't know how we got off on that tear.  Oh, well, we were talking about the fishing.  Let's go to Tucker.  Yeah, blow off the fishing.  Just do the bachelor party.  How about this?  You go to Plum Island and you open like a portable pussy shop.  But you make it like really like a fucking a multi-million dollar warehouse just full of 
[02:40:00]  different portable fuck dolls.  Right next to hoof and mouth and anthrax.  Great.  Let's say hi to Trucker Dave.  Trucker Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Howdy.  I was just looking at my Rand McNally map where you guys are talking about and it  says Plum Island is a federal animal disease center.  Yeah.  Sounds fun, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Where everybody should adopt a pet from.  Mr. Lecter.  Yeah, it's a little creepy. 
[02:40:30]  Are you able to see birds under SWAT team surveillance?  Of course.  Of course.  All right, we're going to try to get one of my brothers on the phone to get to the  bottom of this bachelor party that's turning into a disaster.  I know it's going to end with my brother cooking food for everybody because he's that  type of guy.  Poor Best is going to be doing all the work.  He's not going to have any fun.  How about this?  Why don't you guys, instead of fishing, how about you compromise and you go to the library  and everybody gets their favorite book?  Ooh.  That sounds nice.  Yeah.  That'd be a nice evening. 
[02:41:00]  I'd love to arrange someone's bachelor party and just make it awful like that.  Like, we're all going to sit in the park and eat ice cream bars and then we go to a library  and get our favorite book.  And they're all looking at you like, okay, when's it happening?  Yeah.  When is the big, you know, reveal happening?  And it just doesn't.  It just doesn't.  You say, take it easy.  A little observation about the listeners, you know, just like us, they try to outdo each  other.  Yeah.  It's a known fact that we try to outdo each other every day on the show, right?  Of course.  So you had that fine.  No, we don't.  Geico.  Yes, we do. 
[02:41:30]  We had that very nice Geico caveman line that came in, right?  Yes.  With my brother Elmo going down on shit, coming up, looking like the Geico caveman.  Apparently.  Brilliant line.  To Opie, he likes the hairy bush.  Brilliant line.  Redding has to take it too far.  When Elmo fists a girl, he likes to look like he's wearing furry handcuffs.  Mittens.  I like the caveman better.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I like where the fisting one was coming from, which was just a place of rage and loneliness. 
[02:42:00]  Fisting, by the way, I saw a video recently.  By its very nature.  By its very nature.  And I saw a double fisting in the ass.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I don't get it.  I don't get, like, how you come to realize that one fist in my asshole is not sufficient.  Yeah.  Would you be willing to lard up your other hand and just be silly?  One girl, I put four fingers in a girl, and it was fucking, it's one thing that kind of 
[02:42:30]  goes, yeah, no, in her pussy.  No, I think in my one girlfriend's ass years ago, I got four fingers in, but my nails were  scratching her.  I pulled my hand out, and it was bloody, and I was fucking, oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Many, many years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was dipping.  It was like, I was like a, it was like, yeah.  Listen to me.  Yeah.  Dipping.  My thumb was tucked in.  My thumb snuck in behind my other fingers.  It was like the little kid brother of the other fingers that snuck into the club, but 
[02:43:00]  it wasn't a real fist, though, because it wasn't closed.  Yeah.  It's like when you're trying to slip off handcuffs.  Yeah.  The hand you make, you got to really thin it out.  Yeah.  Hey, a couple things before the break.  Jeremy in Jersey.  I wonder if this is true.  Jeremy, speak.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  The conspiracy is that Lyme's disease escaped from Plum Island.  There was a man-made disease or something like that.  Why?  I've heard that about AIDS, too, and everything else.  Why would Lyme's disease, which doesn't exist. 
[02:43:30]  A bird flew from the island across the sound over to Lyme, Connecticut, and ticks bit them,  and then it transferred to the ear, and so on and so forth.  That's wonderful.  That's why we got to kill every bird.  It is odd that they put this disease island so close where birds can just like fly right  from the island after eating some diseased crap, and then fly over here.  Well, I'm sure that they have it worked out.  I'm sure they do.  Yeah, I'm sure.  The place has been open since the 1800s.  Now, the birds have to actually register and shit. 
[02:44:00]  It's a really weird thing.  Birds are not allowed to fly around without ID.  Civilization's going to end because some dude was too hungover to do the right thing.  Yeah.  He's going to be in charge of the key at one of these fucking facilities.  Like the stand.  Yeah, exactly.  Captain Trips.  I like that a lot, but I hate what he called the one guy a walking dude.  Oh, yeah.  I just didn't like that.  He wrote that in the 70s.  I know.  It's a really brilliant book, but Mother, whatever her name was, who was the old black lady?  Mother Abigail. 
[02:44:30]  Mother Abigail and the walking dude.  Yeah.  I prefer It.  Yeah.  Pennywise was a great character.  Or how about Satan?  What do you prefer?  It.  It's my favorite Stephen King book.  Pennywise the Dancing Clown.  Which one?  Oh, Pennywise is great.  Just loves the children.  I was doing an Abbot and Custle.  Oh.  I didn't get it.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I know.  You didn't get it?  How'd you read it?  Hey, let's say hi to Cindy and Bill Morse. 
[02:45:00]  Cindy.  Cindy.  Hi.  How you guys doing?  Good.  What's up?  Love your show.  Is the restaurant open for the public tonight if I wanted to come by for dinner or if it's  a closed party?  How many?  Something tells me she won't have to drive far.  How many guys can you blow in an hour?  Wow.  Whoa.  How many do you have?  Hmm.  Cool.  I love your show, guys.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How are you going to get from Bayshore?  Belmore. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I know.  I said Bayshore.  She sounds like she's from Bayshore.  Oh.  Well, Belmore.  Belmore is very similar.  Yeah, Belmore is.  Belmore, you go on the Seaproys debate.  Yeah, that's what I'm just saying.  Anyone that sounds like this, and I'm sorry about the local.  It's what we're doing.  It's our local show Friday we're doing.  But anyone that sounds like this girl right here has to take the Seaproys debate to get  anywhere.  There's no way you could be hot. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  How high is your hair?  How high?  Yeah.  Do you tease it up?  Absolutely.  Put nice spray on it.  I thought so.  Absolutely.  Do you have one of those necklace nameplates?  Used to.  Yeah.  I bet you did.  Hotty number one.  Hotty number one.  Do you have fingernails with those wacky designs on them? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Do you like it?  No.  I don't like the wacky designs on it.  Did you at one point have big, long fingernails?  Oh, the claws?  No, I wasn't into the claws.  Where's your tat?  Tat?  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  We don't believe in tattoos either.  We don't do tats.  Wow.  I'm afraid of needles.  No, no.  You don't belong down there.  Wait, do you have a tattoo? 
[02:47:00]  Do you have a tattoo of Meadowlark Lemon's autograph surrounding your asshole?  No, that's your sidekick.  Meadowlark Clay.  Wow.  It's just a nice long name that he could start right by the bottom of one cheek and he could  sign right around your asshole perfectly.  Her asshole.  I'll do it in permanent ink.  All right.  Why don't we, we're going to take a break.  I don't know.  Are we allowed to come in for dinner or we can't come by?  Yeah, come on by. 
[02:47:30]  Come on, boy.  Come on, boy.  Come, boy.  All right.  Take the steepest Orster Bay north until you get into Huntington.  Actually, you'll get into Orster Bay, you'll get into Orster Bay and just, you can hop  right on 25 on Jericho Turnpike and just take that.  I know, and I know the back road, Woodbury Road all the way up.  Take Woodbury.  You know what the police is.  If she knows the back road, she's a drinker, man.  You're a drinker.  You play police Pac-Man many a night. 
[02:48:00]  God bless you.  You lush.  All right, dear Cindy.  I will blush, I promise.  Blush.  All right, we'll see you tonight, stupid.  And are you showing up?  Huh?  I've thought about it.  No, I couldn't even fake it.  I don't know.  I don't know what my plans are this evening.  What are your options?  I want to go out, but I am so fucking tired.  What's a Friday, though?  I know.  But you can do your nap when you get home.  You go over, you have a piece of cake.  But then I got to, it's gym day. 
[02:48:30]  It's gym today.  But you're not going to work out until nine at night.  You go, you work out.  You take a nap.  You get up, you go over, you have a cocktail.  Perhaps a piece of cheese cake.  Champagne!  Champagne cocktail!  Maybe you go over, you have some turtle soup, which is an FH Riley special.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Or perhaps you have a little lemon drop soup.  I've been eating key lime pie lately.  That fucking shit is good.  That.  Well, I'm telling you, my girlfriend ordered it. 
[02:49:00]  But she don't, she don't gain a pound, that girl.  It really annoys me.  And you can't pick at her stuff.  I do.  I have little bites of it.  Just little bites.  Eight hundred little bites.  This is why my girlfriend should be kicked.  You got to take a break, don't you?  Yeah.  My girlfriend will eat an entire dessert, and then she'll leave like fucking two bites  of it and convince herself she has willpower.  It's like, hey, stupid, you'll have to piece a crust.  You're not dieting.  She's got abs, though.  She's doing something right.  She's been eating like shit for eight months now, and her fucking, she still has the little 
[02:49:30]  V.  It really annoys me.  Hey, Sam from FBA, he writes, my brother Elmo there, right?  Brother Elmo likes to think of eating pussy as cotton candy with a surprise in the center.  Yeah, with two mating slugs in the middle of it.  You know what's great about this show?  My brother is sleeping right now.  Oh, he doesn't even know.  Oh, he's got his own network of fans.  Oh, are they going to kill him later?  They're all just going to kill him later.  That is MySpace, dude. 
[02:50:00]  Dude, so you like the big hairy muff.  You slept through a good one, dude.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Get us out of here.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Matt is back from Queensbury.  On the instant feedback, he writes, when Brother Elmo goes down on a girl, he likes it to look  like he's singing a duet with Chris Christopherson. 
[02:50:30]  Singing a duet.  And we got my other brother on the line, finally.  Hey, Brett.  What up?  We're talking about Brother Elmo and how he likes Harry Bush.  So freaking ridiculous.  We're hanging out at FH Riley's, you know, a bunch of brothers and some friends, and  all of a sudden, you know, Elmo admits this, and he didn't get any support from anyone around.  No, huh?  No, and he has admitted the hairier the better, right? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  He likes when you wear bikinis, and the hair actually sticks out the sides.  Oh, nice.  He freaking loves that.  He doesn't want a pussy.  He wants a Jewish man's head.  What's the matter with him?  He wants payus coming off of the side of the pussy.  Wow.  So he really likes it thick and hairy.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Smell everything.  He just loves that.  Smell it.  He calls it.  Non-natural.  He calls it.  Yeah.  What does he call it again?  What?  Non-natural.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Non-natural. 
[02:51:30]  What's that?  He just likes it natural.  He likes to just get in the hair.  So what's going on?  Uh, well, last night was good.  Yeah, but I got to get to bed pretty soon, because I guess we're going fishing in the  morning.  Dude, what the fuck?  I get to bed.  Scott, come on.  Scott's insane.  I got to be in bed by noon to be up by three.  Yeah, fuck that.  So I get to roll up on the side of a boat.  Yeah, that's what you'll all be doing.  It's like, wow, great, thanks. 
[02:52:00]  Thanks for the bachelor party.  This is great.  The big sink.  Out in the calm waters of the fucking North Atlantic.  Right, right.  Unbelievable.  I actually had a nightmare last night that we were adrift, and I couldn't get back, and  I was going to miss my wedding, and we just kept floating further and further out to sea.  Uh-oh.  One of those dreams, yeah.  That's just one of those, you know, anxiety dreams.  Yeah.  Hey, how's the future mother-in-law?  She's all right today?  She's okay.  She's a little upset.  Yeah, we talked about it earlier. 
[02:52:30]  That's just sucked last night.  They've been pulling that gag out there for a while now, breaking windows when women leave  purses on their seats.  They definitely stalked it.  There's no question they were waiting there.  They hit the most expensive car, and the time period that we're there for a half an hour  tops, hit and run.  We all went to the woods.  If we found them, forget it.  But I was gone.  Or a girl.  It was ridiculous.  But what are you going to do, I guess?  I tried on my tuxedo this morning.  My pants? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And look like MC Hammer.  That's how huge they are at the top.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  I guess you guys have been trying to get in touch with me, but I was at the tuxedo place  banging on the door trying to get in.  They don't even fit.  It's ridiculous.  And they taper all the way down to the bottom.  I look exactly like MC Hammer.  It looks like it.  There's still an arrow at the bottom, you can see my socks before you even fish.  And then big balloon pants up top.  My brother Brett's going to look like a genie at his own wedding.  Hey, but we're going fishing tomorrow. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do you want to fish tomorrow?  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying just get Brett on the line and then whatever he says goes.  Yeah.  Hey, you're the law.  It becomes a point where everyone tries to please you and then it quickly swings when  you try to please everyone else.  So I think my brother...  Fuck it.  What do you want to do?  I kept telling Scott last night, I'm like, Scott, you're going to get a lot of calls from  a lot of brothers tomorrow saying, I'm too hungover to make it all the way out to Orion  Point.  Yeah.  We're originally going to go shark fishing where you get strapped down in the chair at 
[02:54:00]  five o'clock in the morning and go about three miles off.  Oh, that's good.  That's wonderful.  I'm drinking all freaking night long.  Who's going to go to sleep?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, then you'll get the good idea.  You know, we ought to just stay up and then you're exhausted, tired, trying to fight a  shark.  That's a good idea.  I'd rather keep drinking.  Yeah.  Dude, the best thing?  Keep drinking.  That way you don't feel your hangover.  Yeah.  And then we'll drive fucking 50 miles more out east with local cops that don't fucking 
[02:54:30]  take PBA cards.  Now we're supposed to, I think, into Riverhead now.  Now I think we're supposed to toot around in Riverhead.  Oh, really?  Did you hear that one?  No.  Is Riverhead out there?  Riverhead.  How about he gets a fucking boat in North Port?  Local again for everybody.  Look at that.  Very local show today.  Why don't you guys just go to Manhattan and fucking, like, tomorrow morning, just fucking  take the Staten Island Ferry. 
[02:55:00]  Or just go, like, take Circle Line and Circle New York.  Circle on show.  Fishing off of it.  Yeah, just show each other where the Empire State Building is.  Chester's liver checking in.  He writes, Elmo will only go fishing if he can catch some bearded clam.  It doesn't end.  I love it.  A fucking sea urchin comes up on the boat.  He tries to make out with it.  He'll be fine after a little hair of the pussy that bit him.  Elmo likes to pretend that he's tongue-kissing Chewbacca. 
[02:55:30]  What's wrong with him?  I don't know what's wrong with him.  He just likes it.  Yeah.  I like the big bush.  As far as tomorrow goes, I don't know what to tell anybody.  If we're going to Riverhead to toot around in the harbor, it's probably Red Tide and  dead fish all over the place.  Riverhead to fucking boat in Riverhead?  Yeah, for blues and bass.  Jesus.  Do you like fishing?  Good question, Jimmy.  I love fishing.  I absolutely love it, but I like game fishing and things like that. 
[02:56:00]  You can catch a snapper off any beach.  You don't need to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and get on a boat after drinking.  So you really don't want to go fishing tomorrow.  You want to kind of sleep in and relax, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  And then just see how the afternoon goes.  It's my last day.  Then life is over.  The only boat I'd expect to see in Riverhead would be the Amistad.  I didn't think Riverhead was much of a nautical town. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, by the way, Brett, this is the email I got from Scott.  Put out an announcement for aquatic visual candy for Brett.  We'll be cruising out of Flanders Bay and headed up to East Hampton by late morning.  If any listeners will be out on the water, we'll hook up with them, provided they have  hotties on board.  You go.  Yeah, right?  Because there's always hotties in the ocean.  Want to die out together?  What the freak? 
[02:57:00]  There's always hotties in the ocean when you're deep-sea fishing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's only guys with chicks in carpets and dumping them off the side.  That's the only hotties we're going to see.  Right.  That's five and a half.  Hey, it sounds like the restaurant's busy.  I hear a few phones ringing in the background.  Yeah, I think a lot of people ask you if we're open to the public tonight.  I'm telling you, I got to get up early.  I'll be out of here and go freaking fishing.  You are not going fishing.  So everyone have a drink on me in my honor as I'm getting my cheese.  Yeah, I know.  It's great.  We need to make money, not to give more of the bar away. 
[02:57:30]  Brother Elmo likes a snatch that he can put pigtails in.  Dan from Kansas.  David from the Bronx.  When Brother Elmo goes down on a chick, it looks like he's giving an Ewok CPR.  They're coming in like crazy.  Yeah, she comes down and asks the girls about their box.  How hairy it is, do they shave, do they trim?  And once he starts getting involved with them, he convinces them not to trim again.  I got to sit down with Elmo and talk to him. 
[02:58:00]  He probably likes it because he can stand up diet Dr. Pepper's inner pubic hair.  What's the matter with him?  It's fucking out of his mind.  He loves his diet.  All he wants is a Dr. Pepper and a cunt that should have been around in 1840.  We got to fucking sit Elmo down and talk to him.  He likes to look like a presidential candidate from 1820.  I hope I got the year right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, poor Elmo's sleeping.  He has no idea, man, when he wakes up. 
[02:58:30]  No.  All the bashing he's going to get.  He likes diet Dr. Pepper and hairy bushes.  There you go.  That's awesome.  Yeah, I would say no fishing, we'll just party.  What time is the festivities tonight?  I guess around 8th, I think it's supposed to start.  Yeah.  I got 10,000 things to do today.  Try to get ready for the weekend, for Sunday.  For the big wedding.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  Congrats, man.  Best of luck.  I'm excited.  I'm very excited.  Yeah.  Everyone's trying to talk me out of it, but I'm excited.  Good girl.  No, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the opening show.  Oh, well, we're seeing.  My brother is marrying a wonderful girl.  Carrie Lynn is awesome.  Very, very good.  Very beautiful.  And how hot is her mom?  This is Opie.  This is Opie back on.  Her mom looks like her older sister or something. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, that's the other deal once I saw her.  Can I see your parents?  All right, you're in.  You know what you want to do tonight to get crazy?  When I'm in a party and I want to get nuts, I wind up taking Eddie Murphy's.  My girl wants to party all the time, and I crank it up, and the fucking dance floor explodes.  Oh, well, that's what you got to do.  Yeah, it just gets nuts.  Ah, go crazy.  The conga line, like, it's getting hot, hot, hot.  Ah, you got to do that, of course, of course. 
[03:00:00]  I mean, I know how to get people crazy.  Hey, um, was that restaurant haunted last night?  Yes.  That's what they say.  There's been a graveyard behind it.  There's been many subjects there.  We can stay where we were, all right?  You're not going back there.  I'm never going back there.  Why?  Haunted?  I can't get into that, I guess.  But it's the country house in, uh, Stony Brook.  Okay.  And supposedly they hand out pamphlets. 
[03:00:30]  The waiter's a huge fan of this show, by the way.  He chased me out into the parking lot.  But, um...  Yeah, it was...  They hand out pamphlets, and, uh...  Well, he was chasing you out in the parking lot.  Was there a problem with the service, sir?  I can't tell you how brilliant that is.  It was so brilliant, I had to explain it, just so everyone can enjoy that one, Jimmy.  Fuck you.  Why is he chasing you out in the parking lot? 
[03:01:00]  Oh, what a scumbag.  That was funny.  No, they hand out pamphlets talking about how this place is haunted or something.  Yeah, people use that gimmick at a bunch of places.  Yeah.  Get a real haunted place where you go to cut your steak open and a ghost fucking stabs you.  Try that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  See what your return fucking customers are. 
[03:01:30]  Bunch of bullshit.  Those hauntings.  All right, hold on a second.  George on Long Island.  George, what's up?  Hey, when Brother Elmo goes down on a chicken, it looks like he's kissing Robin Williams on  the knuckle.  Robin Williams has very hairy hands.  Or on the mouth in Awakenings and Good Will Hunting.  Yes, in the movies where he's a dramatic actor.  Well, it said, it looks like he's biting Robin Williams on the cheek.  That was pretty funny.  Then he redid his line live.  Max, Dallas, what's up? 
[03:02:00]  What's up, guys?  I was wondering, does Brother Elmo get a boner at a ZZ Top concert?  Now you've gone too far.  That's a hairy bush.  Well, yeah, he does.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm fascinated by this Rachel Ray bit.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  They have an animal expert, I guess, with a box.  And she reaches her hand in the box and has to feel around and see what kind of animal  is in there. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, I thought you were still talking about Brother Elmo.  No.  Big hairy box.  All right.  Brad, we'll see you tonight, all right?  All right.  See you guys.  Thanks.  F.H. Reilly's, Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue.  That a boy.  My brother's getting married.  Yep.  Elmo likes a vagina that looks like whack-lip.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  You made my brother hang up for one. 
[03:03:00]  He's gone.  He likes a pussy that looks like wax lips with...  I forgot.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  I know what I'm trying to say, but I...  Oh, you...  Back goes Griffey looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's all too long.  My mistake.  Can I take everyone inside the radio show?  Yesterday, because I told you I was stuck in traffic for literally three hours to get 
[03:03:30]  to the rehearsal dinner for my brother that we were just talking to, and I had the biggest  douche chill moment listening to myself on the replay.  What would happen?  I was so confident about that Julia stillborn child lie.  Oh.  I got everyone's attention in the room.  I should tell everybody.  I raised my hand.  I made everyone stop.  I'm like, oh, here's the showstopper.  You don't have to tell me.  I heard it this morning on the way in.  You did?  Yeah.  Why?  Is that the promo?  Those fuckers?  No, it was the actual show that was being replayed. 
[03:04:00]  And then I came up with Julia still child?  Yeah.  Dude, I wanted to crawl inside my own asshole.  It's a great place to hide.  You look like an armadillo.  No one expects you to be there.  I heard it on the replay.  Oh, my God.  It was so uncomfortable for myself.  The worst is...  I badly I bombed.  Knowing that...  You're checking the replays on...  Oh, there's times I'll turn off the replays. 
[03:04:30]  I'm like...  You know something's coming up and you talk louder about something?  Yeah.  Hey, look at that.  It's a gas station.  Yeah.  Yeah, like she'll hear part of it like...  Hey, what time is that?  She's a cunt.  What did I miss?  Nothing, nothing.  It's not a Margaret Thatcher.  Right, right.  Right, right, right.  Right.  Oh, man.  Because I got everyone's attention.  I mean, sometimes you just go with something real fast.  You're not even really thinking.  You're bombed.  Whatever.  But those times when you're stopping the entire show...  Like, here comes the punchline.  Hold on. 
[03:05:00]  Because you think you have the line and then you fuck it up.  Like if I was trying to say, like, Elmo likes to push...  Yeah, well, exactly.  ...wax lips with a tumbleweed on top of...  Right, exactly, Jimmy.  Not bad.  Yeah, not bad.  It might have been good if I got off on the first eight tries.  Bill from Waterford, Opie's brother, gets a rod whenever Fidel Castro speaks.  Yes, we've been through the Castro.  Yeah.  Help Bill from Waterford to fucking get another dictator.  Yeah.  All right.  Another bearded dictator.  Exactly.  All right.  We've got to leave early.  Sorry.  Line of the day time. 
[03:05:30]  Line of the day.  Two runners up and one big win.  Yeah.  All right.  Where's my sparkly unicorn?  I'm feeling good.  Well, we were going to do Once Upon a Potty today, though.  Oh, I don't know.  Yes, we were.  Were is the...  Oh, thank you.  There's a little wow on Pal Talk.  All right.  We could do it.  We could do that next week.  Who's showing her tits?  Oh, Flight Pat?  She's great. 
[03:06:00]  Fuck you, Pat.  Pat from Munaki.  Opie Cramden.  Stand back.  The radio host is going to make her funny.  Stand back.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Wow.  Yeah, we'll just watch that.  Yeah.  I like that.  It's Friday. 
[03:06:30]  You get a nice wow like that.  A standing wow, too.  Yeah.  Where you see the midsection, the whole package.  Everything.  Everything.  That's the everything.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Bad boy.  Yeah.  I just decided up, Gray, my BlackBerry.  Oh.  Number one.  And I decided to go with the double tap.  Stupid, right?  What?  Let me see it.  Is that the one with two letters on one?  I like that one better. 
[03:07:00]  I think...  That's a little bit too...  Speaking of...  Oh, there we go.  Speaking of double Ds.  I mean, double tap.  She has lovely tits.  Did I make a mistake, though, with the double tap?  I don't think so.  For my BlackBerry?  You should have went with the iPhone.  Sure.  They're ten bucks now.  It doesn't matter what you say.  No one gets it anyway.  That iPhone thing's...  No.  Steve has the ultimate phone.  Steve, what is the phone that's going to kill the iPhone?  The what? 
[03:07:30]  The tilt.  The tilt.  What is the tilt?  It's...  I don't know who makes it.  I think it's...  I know it's going to be AT&T, whatever singular it was, but it runs on Windows Mobile, and  it's got faster internet speeds than your iPhone.  So does any two.  What?  Anything has faster...  Well, not yours in particular, but I meant iPhones in general, because it's got a faster  network.  The tilt.  And it's got a hard keyboard, too, which I like.  A hard keyboard.  Look at this.  Screen is too small.  It's like, stop with your tilt.  No, it doesn't.  It's the iPhone killer. 
[03:08:00]  It's not.  It's not the iPhone killer.  The fucking tilt is a dud.  Let me tell you something about cell phones, people.  It's a fad, all right?  Oh, wow.  Cell phones are a fad.  He's going to be switching back to the studio.  Like rock and roll.  Everybody, Monday.  Let me tell you something.  Cell phones are a fad.  The tilt is awful.  No, it's not.  No, there will be something.  I heard Nokia has one that can compete with the iPhone.  I don't think so.  Yeah, Nokia probably does.  My manager will have it if it does.  You know what?  The second, third generation iPhone is going to be amazing.  Remember when the iPhone, before it came out, I heard the iPhone was going to cure cancer. 
[03:08:30]  Now what?  You can't even get on the internet fast.  See what happens?  The iPhone?  Just wait.  Second, third generation iPhone?  That's going to be amazing.  That fucking tilt is awful.  And the people that are bitching?  I read so many posts on the message boards about the iPhone and people are pissed off and the fact that they're giving a $200 rebate now to people that bought the iPhone before.  $100.  Because they're decreasing the price by, I think, $200.  A bunch of people are mad, but people are like, hey, you paid for it early. 
[03:09:00]  A lot of people said don't get it when it first comes out, but you paid for it to be one of the people that had it first.  So don't bitch about it.  And he's giving it $100 back, which is actually cool.  I don't even know how they're doing that.  Like, you don't have a receipt.  You just walk in and show them your iPhone and go, look, I've had it on for like, you know, a few days.  Blame from South Carolina.  My brother Elmo, yes, he does have a cell phone.  And yes, it is a Black Harry.  The Black Harry. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, is he going to catch shit?  Oh, my God.  That poor motherfucker.  He picked the wrong morning to sleep in.  He can't defend himself.  He's going to wake up and be like, what happened?  He rarely sleeps in.  He's a night owl.  And I guess last night was a long night.  You know what the funny thing will be?  He'll ask you.  It'll be like, did you mention something?  Or did you do a break on this?  Oh, yeah.  It was the entire show. 
[03:10:00]  We talked about your love of Harry Gash.  Let's go to Vince on Long Island.  Not even a passing little thought.  Oh, by the way, this is technically bonus show.  Because a lot of people bitch him.  Because we were going to leave early.  But now we're already five minutes later than when we wanted to leave.  Yeah, so shut up.  So now we're in bonus time now.  So you can thank us any time.  Because we were going to leave at 10.15.  So actually we're up to 12 minutes of bonus time here.  Elmo likes a pussy that looks like two thumbs on top of the big ragu's head. 
[03:10:30]  Steve, you like the Harry Bush?  No.  Oh, wow.  How about without hair?  Yeah.  Vince, Long Island, what?  You know, Country House is definitely haunted.  If you looked at the front of the place, there's still like a little girl.  There's a ghost who looked out those top windows up there.  Yeah, where's the picture? 
[03:11:00]  I got married there 10 years ago.  Where's the picture?  If it happens all the time.  Where are the fucking pictures?  Where's the video of carrying on a conversation with a ghost?  Can I?  I got it.  Oh, yes.  E-Rock, what did you just grab the mic?  Oh, boy.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Now, here's a good one.  I got to put my grapefruit down so we can turn on E-Rock's mic.  Yes, E-Rock?  Go ahead.  I said Steve likes a headless bush.  Thanks, Jim. 
[03:11:30]  I don't know why.  Wait, you really thought he had you turn your mic on because he thought you had a good one?  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I didn't know what is a headless bush.  What's a headless bush?  Steve always talks about decapitating women.  But, never mind.  That's not the bush, though.  That's not the bush. 
[03:12:00]  He likes a headless bush and E-Rock likes a punchline-less joke.  See, that's a funny joke.  Making the marriage plans there, E?  Oh.  That's a discussion happening this weekend.  Wow, you guys are moving forward fast, huh?  It's probably going to be a while, but...  Oh, boy.  But the discussion starts this weekend.  Yeah.  And as per who?  As per her telling me that we need to start discussing this. 
[03:12:30]  Get used to that, my friend.  You get used to that.  That whole telling thing.  Just get used to it.  She's telling you.  That this weekend, we start to talk.  Where are you going to register?  We have to register.  Where are you registering?  That I have no idea.  I don't even...  Oh, my God.  Obviously, it's super market.  Travis, would you just start laughing if he has no idea? 
[03:13:00]  No, we all laugh because we...  The fan had a funny line.  Oh, damn it.  What was it?  Where...  He's registering.  I said Penn Station.  Penn Station.  Hey.  That's where I got my ring.  Oh.  Yeah.  I think you...  They'll probably go to a nice place.  If she's picking this, I'm sure it'll be...  Yeah.  Then where he'd pick it.  I have more faith in her ability to pick it.  You know what's scary?  I'd go to Penn Station every once in a while.  Yeah.  Because I don't want to deal with that horrific traffic. 
[03:13:30]  I don't see a jewelry store down there.  There was one when I went.  I remember.  The front door smelled like piss.  Yeah.  It was great.  It's this pissy-smelling little diamond chip.  Yeah.  This guy might have ended the Elmo bit.  I'm not sure, though.  PC from Virginia.  Ah, local hero.  He's including in his email here.  Elmo likes a pussy to resemble half a peach surrounded by Julius Irving's haircut circa 1978. 
[03:14:00]  Tell that long-winded fucking idiot to never write again anything.  My ring did not say I love...  I heart New York on it.  It would have been good if it did, though.  You know what Elmo likes?  He likes a vagina.  Hmm.  To resemble an orangutan's asshole.  Julius Irving's haircut circa 1971 when the...  We got it.  Circa.  Anyone who writes Circa in joke?  Circa.  D-Rock, please remove Harry Potter's dick from the Peltalk cam. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, you...  Thank you.  But you pissed him off.  That's what he...  He gets it.  I know.  That's how he gets his revenge.  Right.  Right.  By pleasing himself with pictures.  Well, guys, now we really gotta leave.  We gave you 15 minutes.  Yeah, come on.  We gotta go.  We really do.  And don't get confused.  We really did.  Because we were gonna leave at 10.15.  Yeah.  So now we gave you 15 minutes of bonus.  Because I remember at 9.15, Opie said, we give these fuckers an hour and then I'm out.  That's right. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  By these fuckers, we do mean you people listening.  You know what's gonna suck?  In another, I think, four weeks, we're gonna find out if this merger goes through?  Yep.  And then, like, they're gonna start paying attention to us again.  I know.  Well, that's why we're doing this.  Fuck me.  That's why we're just kind of, you know, as they say, calling it in.  Right.  Call it in.  That was a damn funny show today.  Was it?  If I hear one goddamn bitch about it.  That's right. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  Yes.  Bush without a head.  Just thought I'd say it.  I wanna see if it was funny when I said it.  Bush without a head?  Why don't we see what the line of the day thing is all about?  Oh, right.  Any time, I guess.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  What are you guys going out of the Elmo Fitzgerald tomorrow?  The Elmo Fitzgerald.  That was very funny. 
[03:16:00]  Brother.  It's hauling pubic hair across Lake Michigan.  That was a funny line, the Elmo Fitzgerald.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a first runner-up.  Second runner-up.  Oh.  Just in case the winning line of the day cannot fulfill its responsibility as the line of the  day, the first runner-up will step up and be the line of the day.  Or if there's nude pictures found of the winner. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, Kelly Force, you know we didn't call it in today.  What?  She's a regular.  Kelly.  Kelly, stop.  Don't start.  Don't make me use the C word.  Don't make us show you how we can call it in a show.  Yeah.  We have done that in the past.  Oh, boy.  Next week, by the way, for some of the old listeners, E-Rock, where'd you find this?  The Carol Miller shit.  Just dig into the archives and...  Have we played any Carol Miller shit on XM?  No.  None?  Oh, it's really good.  In the three years we've been broadcasting? 
[03:17:00]  No.  None of it.  From WNW.  Dude, sometime next week, we got the Carol Miller tapes.  We were...  1998.  We were reviewing...  1998!  98.  This is nine years old?  It's off a cassette tape.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Jesus.  Amazing.  You want to give him a taste?  I can't help myself.  Look at this now.  The first one?  We're going to be here till 11.  Just a taste.  Oh, my God.  Just a taste.  You know, like we're supposed to be.  I made it sound like, hey, come on. 
[03:17:30]  I'm going to put in some OT today.  Dude, we can't help ourselves.  All right.  Give one little taste.  The Carol Miller tapes, when Ant and I came to our hometown, basically, you know, New York  area, both from Long Island, whatever, but got to do New York radio at WNW, which was  a legendary rock station.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty much one of the first rock stations in America. 
[03:18:00]  Like, some of the guys were hanging out with the Beatles when they first landed in America.  I mean, they go way back.  Like, you're talking legendary.  It blew the 90s, though.  It fucking blew.  Right.  And they hired Anthony and I from Boston after we got fired because they were ready to mix  shit up.  Yep.  They were ready to get rid of the old and bring in the new.  Because the ratings were in the shitter.  But the problem was, they were sort of ready to bring in the new and get rid of the old. 
[03:18:30]  They didn't want to totally commit.  Right.  They didn't want to commit.  So they had Ant and I kind of talking a lot in afternoons.  No one gave a shit.  No one liked our show yet.  They really didn't.  They were like, who are these fucking assholes on this radio station that we grew up listening  to?  And then you had all the jocks that were at the radio station, some of them well over 20  years.  Yeah.  Well over.  And I think Carol Miller, they looked at her as like the rookie because she was there 15  years. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  15 fucking years.  She was the newcomer.  At one station.  Just playing records.  So they were doing this, what was it called?  The Evolution of Rock and Roll, where they went through all this crappy music for like  a weekend or a week or something.  And Ant and I had to like play along with our dumb show.  So we started like breaking the records on the air.  We refused to play the next song and management would come in yelling and screaming at us.  And we're like, what?  You hired us to get a little crazy here.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Why are you getting pissed off?  Not just play the butt rock.  Right.  And the newspapers wrote about it because it was this big thing.  They were really impressed that they were doing the evolution of rock and roll.  And your pals, Opie and Anthony, with no fans whatsoever yet, just fucking destroyed their  little program.  Yeah.  We goofed on it.  And then the jocks started really, really getting pissed off.  And Carol Miller came in to confront us live on our show.  Is that a good setup?  Yes.  Very good.  That's pretty good?  Okay. 
[03:20:00]  And this is from 1998.  What you got to understand is like, this is Ant and I showing a lot of confidence with  no ratings and no listeners.  And get ready to hear the high voice comments.  Are they a little high?  Your voice is a little high.  A little bit?  Well, it's on cassette.  By they, I mean yours.  Well, it's on cassette, though.  Yeah, yeah.  See, it could have stretched.  You're right.  Yeah, the tape stretched.  I'll listen because I'm not sure if my voice is high, too.  I think it is.  Carol Miller hates us.  Here, plug in your headphones, Carol.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Carol is going to be representative of the people that appreciate this music and this special program 
[03:20:30]  The Evolution of the Rock of New York that has been put together here on WNEW.  All right.  So what problem did you have with us yesterday, Carol?  Yeah.  You.  I had a problem with you.  The two of you.  What happened?  No.  What happened?  Just kidding.  She didn't like the fact that Anthony was playing the kazoo to all these great classic  rock music.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That pissed them off. 
[03:21:00]  I was doing kazoo solos to all of their stupid songs.  We were dicks, and they had this huge library that took over the whole studio, right?  Remember, I think it was Rod Stewart baseball?  Oh, yeah.  We decided to break every Rod Stewart CD.  Because they made us play one of his...  What's his dopey song that he had in the 70s?  Do you think I'm sexy?  Yeah.  Do you think I'm sexy?  And so, like, in the middle of the song, not even, like, after maybe 10 seconds, Opie  just stops the song and goes, no, I refuse to play this. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  And management came in.  And people that were listening were thinking that management was in on this and that it  was a bit.  No, it wasn't.  We were just complete assholes.  So, we knew they would try to make us play it, so we played Rod Stewart baseball.  Yeah.  Well, like, all right, we'll play Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart baseball.  And we just got a real bat.  And just started smashing every Rod Stewart CD that was in the studio.  So, we couldn't play any Rod Stewart.  And that was after we sat there for, like, five minutes.  I remember this like it was yesterday, and I wouldn't push the button to start Do You 
[03:22:00]  Think I'm Sexy?  And Ant wouldn't.  It's like, I'm not going to do this.  So, we argued between ourselves, like, I ain't fucking doing it.  He says, I'm not fucking doing it.  And then I think we finally got the clean lady to start it, because we wouldn't do it.  Because, you know, we would be called a fag for the next ten years.  Yeah.  And then finally, after just a minute or two, we said, fuck that.  And we stopped the song and played Rod Stewart baseball.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We called it the air pollution of rock and roll.  All right.  The evolution of rock and roll is the air pollution.  Who was that, Snapman?  Thanks, Snapman.  Wow.  That's great. 
[03:22:30]  She didn't like the fact that Anthony was playing the kazoo to all these great classic rock  tunes.  I think they needed kazoo.  Cheesy, butt-old classic rock songs.  Yeah.  How can we go from a week before we start this special goofing on butt-old rock, and then  we go into butt-old rock, and we're supposed to act like we liked it?  Listen, first of all, it's a matter of opinion, but, you know, a lot of this stuff, including  the stuff that you were ranking on yesterday, I mean, I really dig this stuff.  I was playing it for people. 
[03:23:00]  I was there.  People will dig this stuff.  And you know something?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I dig this stuff, too, when I heard it on N.E.W., but I don't want to hear it anymore.  I want to move on.  That's your problem.  I want to move on to the future.  Yeah, well, I want to hear it.  What do you want to hear?  Third Eye Meatball Blind?  No, I want to hear the latest from the Black Crows.  I want to hear the latest from Kiss.  Yeah.  The latest from the Rolling Stones.  We can't play any of that this week, because we have to play Marshall Crenshaw someday, some  way.  Well, I think this is a good trip down, like, a recent memory lane.  We've been doing that for 31 years. 
[03:23:30]  31 years here at N.E.W.  This has been a classic rock station for many years.  We've been going down memory lane.  You don't know.  Most of these people have every single one of these CDs at home.  If they want to take a trip down memory lane, then they should play it at home.  We used to go talk at home.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, my God.  You're right, though.  Dude, you're totally right.  What are you saying?  Oh, that's so funny.  It gets brutal.  How many listeners?  Oh, no.  You said a taste.  Why, why?  You said a taste. 
[03:24:00]  I know where I'm going to stop this, though.  I've got to play it.  Oh, Christ.  Because she kind of got us there a little bit.  You can tell.  Because, like, the new us would be like, uh-huh-huh-huh-huh.  But back then, we're like, uh-huh-huh.  Can't leave the listeners thinking she got us.  Oh, perish the thought.  All right, how many listeners did we gain today by going down memory lane and playing  Marshall Crenshaw someday, someday?  Marshall Crenshaw did a really nice Christmas concert for us.  Who cares?  I don't care anymore.  A lot of people do.  This is the music that has gotten us to 23rd place. 
[03:24:30]  No, no, no, no.  Yes, it is.  You know what's that?  For God's sake, Carol.  No, it isn't.  If we played most of this music, we wouldn't be in 23rd.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're on crack.  Carol.  I'm not on crack.  There's a lot of music.  Are you having a flashback?  Did you do Acid back in the 60s?  No, I wish I did.  Are you having a flashback?  No.  This is not the music that is going to get us into our first place.  I hope people understand, we weren't helping our cause.  The people listening weren't going, go Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, this is what I think, too.  We didn't have listeners yet.  We were brand new there.  The only people that were listening to the station were people that did like the music. 
[03:25:00]  Right.  So we were getting lambasted by the audience.  They'd call up and go, shut up and play the music.  Stop goofing on it.  By the way, Elmo likes werewolf movies.  He likes werewolf pussy.  Right, right.  This is where I'm going to play this clip, and I promise it.  Oh, Jesus.  This was great because I was begging her to resign.  I'm such a dick.  I'm such a dick. 
[03:25:30]  That is a douche move.  She's been there for 15 years, and we're going to tell her what's right.  Just play it.  It was a good clip, man.  All right.  Carol, take all these CDs.  Look at them.  I'm looking at them.  I'll get a U-Haul truck.  Take every single one of these CDs.  Resign.  Take those CDs, and you can play them wherever you want.  And we'll compete and see who ends up in the top 10 first.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  But I'll tell you one thing.  I'll make a deal with you.  What?  If I play my CDs for a month, and you yak for a month and play yours, I bet you go down  to 25th.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, no, no.  I would like that bet.  No, listen, seriously, guys.  I love you.  Resign.  Take all the CDs, and trust me, there's so many radio stations in New York, so I won't  pick you up.  I'll tell you all something.  You can take all these CDs and play them and see what happens.  I should trust you.  Yeah, trust me.  Now, why shouldn't you trust me?  Resign on the air right now.  Carol Miller's going to talk.  Oh, kiss my ass, but you'd probably like it.  Come on.  Resign on the air.  No, no, no, no, no.  You resign on the air.  Resign on the air.  We've got to move forward here. 
[03:26:30]  Resign.  Yeah, we are.  Take all these CDs, I'll get the U-Haul truck, and resign right now.  No, I resign myself to hopefully remaining in my seat, playing the best rock of the present  past and future that I possibly can.  Is it only a coincidence?  A WNW, the rock of New York.  The only people that are enjoying this is Carol, Scotso, and Dave Herman.  She's not going to resign.  No, I'm not going to resign.  You can have all these CDs and resign.  No, you can have these microphones and resign.  You would have the best CD collection in the history of...  Yo, yo, yo, wait, wait. 
[03:27:00]  Mankind.  You know, actually, we do here at WNW, and that's why we're playing it for you.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  The company line.  This is my music, man.  Don't mess with my music.  Yuck.  Don't mess with my music.  WNW.  This is what's on radio right here.  By the way, we will stop there.  We're revving up, by the way, because next week on the show, we'll play Carol Stuck in  the Past.  Carol buys O&A enemas. 
[03:27:30]  Last successful ratings, 1985.  Oh, I remember that.  Asking Carol to resign again.  Kicking Carol out.  Carol returns.  Carol's ratings.  Carol, the listener's friend.  The challenge.  And Carol cursing us out.  Leading to the point where she wasn't allowed to make eye contact with us again.  She had to wait in the mail room.  Wait in the mail room while we pass by to go into the studio, as per the program director. 
[03:28:00]  God, what a clusterfuck that was.  And I just mocked her to her face, saying, WNW over and over again to her face.  That was a great welcome to New York.  I met her, actually, at 104.3 recently.  I'd never met Carol Nooks.  I wasn't there back then.  And she's sexy, man.  You like her, yeah?  Yeah, man.  She looks good.  You know what?  In the end, I'll say it on the show next week, too.  I respected her just because she had the balls to, you know, in front of us.  Actually, her face is on it.  Yeah, because the rest of the guys at the time at that station also fucking hated our guts. 
[03:28:30]  But they hid, and they would have secret meetings.  They wrote little notes and put it where we were and hung it up on the bulletin board.  Right.  Shit like that.  They had faxes that they would hang up all over the studio.  Faggity idiots.  And they went to, like, the union, and they were trying to get us fired.  All sorts of dirty shit behind the scenes.  Who was the biggest cunt there?  To you.  Let's see.  Well.  Personally.  What do you think?  Oh, God damn.  Yeah, I think it was. 
[03:29:00]  The one that sued us for a few mil?  York tried to.  Really?  Let's just say that.  Yeah, tried to.  Well, that was because he was going through a divorce, and his wife decided to call our  show and announced that she was having a garage sale with all his shit.  And to me, it sounded like she may have been tipping the bottle a bit that day.  And she called our show and said she was auctioning off all of his stuff.  And we went through his stuff, like, all right, what do you got?  And she was talking about some great rock shit. 
[03:29:30]  Rock memorabilia.  Autographs and old concert shirts.  Because he was a pretty successful morning guy and, you know, in his day.  And then we might have gave out the home address and, yeah.  So.  Are you friends with that person today?  No.  The guy I hate the most is his old producer, who was like a double spy.  Oh, this will all be in our book.  I can't wait.  That book's got to.  We got to start writing.  Dude, without a doubt, you got to do it, man.  We had a douchebag. 
[03:30:00]  He doesn't.  This guy was taping our conversations when we weren't on the air, when we were bad  mouthing this person we're talking about with the wife at the garage sale.  He was taping us, saying shit about this guy.  And they attempted to use it as evidence in this massive lawsuit that we were part of.  And this guy would come in and say, you know, hey, man, you guys are cool.  I'm so glad you're here.  He tried to befriend us. 
[03:30:30]  But behind the scenes, he was taping us secretly.  Ain't that great?  And that guy works at the old, the other satellite company.  He's a douche.  There's a bunch of douches in this business.  We better stop right there.  We ought to be douches and leave.  All right.  We got another runner-up line of the day?  Hit it.  Hit it.  They give you...  Yes, United gives a blankie, too.  Yeah, they give you blankets, but they're filled with semen.  How did that get done? 
[03:31:00]  That wasn't dirty.  Yeah.  To be filled with semen is not a sexual thing.  It's a mouth or an asshole or a cunt.  That's what the FCC says.  Exactly.  Only the XM audience heard that.  But you know what?  It doesn't matter who hears it.  As long as someone does.  Gold star.  Oh.  Did you get a unicorn for the other one, Ant?  No.  Or was it Jimmy?  That was Jimmy.  It wasn't me.  I didn't get a unicorn.  It was me.  It was your line, kiddo. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, I did.  Okay, sorry.  Okay, let me put down my sparkle unicorn sticker.  Here's one for me.  Here's your line of the day.  Oh, let it be.  Here comes.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Ope, if you've been shallow-dicked by Master Poe in the parking lot, you should be allowed in. 
[03:32:00]  Osh.  Line of the day.  Jimmy Norton, everybody.  Yep.  Hey, the best of my brother Brad, huh?  Yes, good luck, man.  Next time we talk, he'll be a married man, the owner of FH Riley's, and ah, what the fuck, the doors are open tonight.  Come on by and whisper at the best.  Unless, of course, you want to be some aquatic eye candy. 
[03:32:30]  If you're a hottie.  A hottie?  That could be our aquatic eye candy.  Aquatic?  Fuck, dude.  Aquatic eye candy.  Jesus.  You know that's going to be a name on a message board if it's not ready.  Aquatic eye candy.  Jesus.  Wow, this fucking blackberry is very, very small.  That's a little fella.  I don't like it.  Give me my old one back.  All right. 
[03:33:00]  All righty.  That's it.  See?  I shut pal talk off.  That means, uh...  It means we're done.  Dude, how the fuck did we get to 1050?  Oh, God.  The Carol Miller thing.  And the lines of the day.  Fuckers have no idea.  Oh, God.  Oh, nice stretch.  Give these fuckers 35 extra minutes, and they'll bitch all night.  Oh, just bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  I say fuck them in their fuck holes. 
[03:33:30]  Ooh.  Oh, shit, Tom.  Oh, jeez, I didn't know it was on.  That old gag.  I'm out of here.  Have a good weekend, everybody.  That old gag.  Tell your brother I said congrats.  What?  What?  Yes.  Where'd Jimmy go?  I don't even want to take a shit.  I'm done.  I'm done with the show.  Done.  I will now be leaving. 
[03:34:00]  I must urinate.  I must urinate.  Iraq, are you going to the bachelor party tonight?  Sure.  Ah.  Uninvited.  Can you get on mic?  I love the eye roll.  The Iraq eye roll.  Um, Iraq, you end the show today.  But, like, you should do something cool with it.  Do a good Iraq thing.  Oh, I got a pee-pee, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I got a pee-pee.  Is it happening today? 
[03:34:30]  Um.  I don't think you'd like it.  What is it for?  I'm going to turn off your board so you don't just hit the sound effect.  Hi, Than.  Do you do the intro for them?  All right, let's do it now.  It's all you, buddy.  So, uh.  Hey, up.  This concludes the Opie and Anthony show for this week.  Have you learned anything from us over the years?  Would we ever end a show like that?  No.  Like a rock star.  Uh.  Like, hit your head with a microphone or something.  Do something dumb.  Make Lee Abrams proud.  Lee likes, like, the unexpected. 
[03:35:00]  I don't really know what to do.  Pour acid in your eye.  Something.  Play a foreplay where the fourth cut's always live.  So.  Hi, Than.  Oh, my God.  You still fucking on?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:35:30]  Are you still trying to figure it out?  Fucking ponderous.  He doesn't know what to say to get out of this.  You want to do something unexpected?  Is that it?  No, not really.  Bye.  Right out.  I turned off his board so he can't end the show.  There you go, Eric.  This is an emergency broadcast. 
[03:36:00]  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
