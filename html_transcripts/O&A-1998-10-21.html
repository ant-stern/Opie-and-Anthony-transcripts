<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a spirited discussion about the Yankees' World Series sweep of the Padres.  The hosts relentlessly mocked Padres fans and their perceived poor sportsmanship, interspersed with jokes about Joe DiMaggio's health and criticisms of Bob Costas' broadcasting style, including mocking the overabundance of statistics in sports commentary.  A caller then described Tony Gwynn's surprisingly bumpy head after removing his helmet, which inexplicably segued into a lengthy and explicit debate about women's body hair, generating strong reactions from listeners.  The conversation took another sharp turn, focusing on David Letterman's monologue featuring unusually large farm animals, specifically a pig's exaggerated genitalia, and further devolved into riffing on Jay Leno's continued Clinton jokes.

Andrew Dice Clay called in to promote a cameo on *Dharma & Greg*, engaging in a humorous exchange with the hosts who playfully teased him.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with Mark Golan, editor-in-chief of *Maxim* magazine.  They discussed funny articles from the current issue, such as a fictional world ruled by men and satirical children's book reimaginings.  Golan and the hosts also brainstormed ideas for *Maxim*'s "100 Stupid Things to Do When You're Bored" feature, encouraging listener submissions.  The segment ended with a listener recounting a prank involving mayonnaise and a porn booth. Throughout this section, contests were held to give away tickets to R.E.M. and Lenny Kravitz concerts.

The show then transitioned into a segment devoted to childhood pranks and memories, filled with graphic anecdotes about bodily fluids, including saliva, glue, and paste consumption.  Several callers shared their own outrageous pranks, ranging from placing condoms in unexpected places to deploying whoopee cushions in highway rest stops, and other pranks involving candy and bathroom antics. Mark Golan remained a guest in studio during this segment.  The conversation shifted to Halloween memories, discussing the types of candy received and anxieties about tampered treats, and the kinds of houses visited while trick-or-treating.  More reminiscing about childhood pranks and candy preferences followed, including a cryptic mention of a "junior mint accident" whose details were never revealed. The broadcast concluded with another plug for *Maxim* magazine's November issue, featuring Golan on the cover.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, with the Spin Doctor, sending that out to Jill, heading into the city to celebrate her birthday tonight.  Yeah.  That stockbroker is Dave's wife, right?  Yeah.  Happy birthday, Jill. It's Opie, it's Anthony.  She's celebrating with him, right?  I do believe so, yes.  Not with Jerry.  She is a married woman.  Yeah.  Seems to be what attracts Jerry these days.  What is up with Jerry Seinfeld?  We'll have to talk about him a little later.  He's going after all our girls.  Leave some for us, will you, Jerry? 
[00:00:30]  I need women!  Kramer!  Women, bring them here!  We got lots to do today.  Actually, I want to know where we're meeting tonight.  Meeting?  Are we going to be in Times Square when the Yankees win it all tonight?  Yeah, I think that's the party central, Times Square.  All right.  Spill out onto the streets all drunk.  Hey, Yankees!  I'm a one!  Woo!  Is it painfully obvious that we're winning the World Series today?  Get the brooms.  Do the Padres honestly have a chance? 
[00:01:00]  And I know someone out there is freaking out.  Don't jinx the team!  Stop.  I better call the fan.  Oh, my God!  They're jinxing the team!  As you've heard, yes, on the fan.  No one.  No team ever coming back from a three-game deficit.  I learned everything about the World Series today listening to those guys.  More than I ever, ever wanted to know.  They really need to start talking about hockey and football because they're running out of  facts about World Series games.  Thank God the Yankees will sweep this thing. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Just end it.  That way we won't have to go to extended radio shows on...  But there's so many negative people out there.  You know, we're about to win another World Series.  And people are like, yeah, but Bernie Williams probably won't be a Yankee next year.  Can we talk about that for an hour?  Let's enjoy the moment.  And then we'll worry about who's going to be here next year.  Here's the call I wanted to hear.  Yeah, go ahead.  Here's the call I wanted to hear.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Is that the fan?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Love the show.  I was watching the game last night. 
[00:02:00]  Okay.  I saw Tony Glenn take his helmet off, his batting helmet.  Yeah.  Why does his head look like Fred Flintstone's bowling ball?  You know?  It's all bumpy and everything.  Because at one point he took that helmet off and his head looked like it had been an artillery  practice field or something.  So there's bumps on his head.  I dare someone to call a fan with that question.  That would be a good question because I was wondering that.  I would laugh my ass off if I heard that.  The helmet off was like, whoa.  Yeah.  That was a pretty interesting observation yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Well, you had to get your observations where you could.  Everything else was pretty obvious.  Yeah.  I just loved it.  Yeah.  Watch the game and watch all those Padres fans in the stands.  Woo!  Waving their towels.  Yeah, yeah.  Wave your towels.  Yeah, that's real cute.  And they're all, they think they're going to win.  They get ahead and they're all, yeah!  And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, that one is out of here!  And everybody's, ah!  Tighten their faces right up, huh?  Yeah, they need the towels to wipe the tears from their eyes at this point. 
[00:03:00]  And then you see them in the stands.  They're all like in shock.  They're just looking around like, but we were just winning the game.  Hey, wait a minute, but wait a minute, it was, it was just, we were ahead.  And we're supposed to win what, what happened?  So that one woman, the older woman, with the big ball with the rag hanging out of it?  Yeah.  And she presses it against her head?  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  But I thought it was working.  We were ahead for, oh my God, we lost.  Yeah, the Padres fans are all pretty pathetic, aren't they?  Just, just, accept the fact that you're going to just get swept and bludgeoned and beaten  by what is probably the best team baseball's ever seen.  Ever.  That's it.  Yeah.  You know, don't feel bad about it.  I mean, people have been beat by a lot worse teams.  And Joe DiMaggio, hang in there.  Don't die on us before they, before they win the World Series. 
[00:04:00]  Jolt and Joe, they've had to install a sump pump in his lungs at this point.  Well, he had pneumonia.  Yeah, and they're getting the fluid out of his lungs.  That's very scary for a guy in his 80s.  Yeah, I mean, that age.  So, Joey, hang in there, please.  We need you.  Yeah, you don't want him dying during the game.  No, of course not.  Afterwards, it'll be like a big thing if he does, you know, pass on.  He'll be like, well, Jolt and Joe had to hang in there and see the Yankees win another World Series. 
[00:04:30]  Those old sports casters.  There you go.  Well, you know what I'm happy about, watching the World Series on TV?  That we don't have to listen to Bob Costas.  Yeah, that's a good feature.  I'm actually enjoying the broadcast.  Yeah.  He is so freaking over the top.  Isn't he?  Yeah, he gets profound is what happens.  Way too profound.  He puts too much insight into plays that are pretty self-explanatory.  Yeah.  You just watch them.  I like watching the game.  All right, very good.  That's it.  Very good. 
[00:05:00]  How was my grammar this first break?  Pretty good?  I wasn't paying attention, but we could check.  Okay.  We'll review the tapes.  All right.  And we'll see if you've made any grammatical errors.  A lot of people lately have told me that I have a grammar problem, so I'm trying to concentrate on my words.  I think the word was horrendous.  Horrendous.  That's the woman used yesterday.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Really helps my self-esteem.  Thanks.  No, really.  It's great.  Fax line here.  212-957-WNEW.  Phone line.  We don't need to give that out.  The phones are ringing like crazy. 
[00:05:30]  And we got the instant feedback for you.  Yes, we do.  WNEW.com.  Click on our pictures and instantly emails.  You're in the studio.  I should have said we got the instant feedback for you.  Not for you.  For you.  Don't even get hung up on it.  Okay.  On the way, the latest from R.E.M. and the Rolling Stones next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I know a lot of faithful listeners are still listening right now, so I got a special little  treat for you guys.  Okay?  If they stuck it out through the commercials.  They definitely stuck it out, and now I'm going to give you a little treat.  When you hear U2 is even better than the real thing, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027. 
[00:06:00]  You're going to win tickets to see R.E.M. tonight.  How cool is that, huh?  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York. 
[00:06:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  212-757-1027 if you've got something for the show.  Hi, N.E.W.  Are you guys sick of listening to sports at all?  I mean, just, just, just, now listen, did you watch a Jet game?  Yeah.  They come out with that ridiculous goddamn statistic that, let me see, no team that has  lost to the Jets during the regular season has ever won the Super Bowl.  Wow. 
[00:07:00]  Do I really need to, do I really need to hear that?  How about last night's game?  There was a moth on the pitcher's cap.  I was waiting, this just in, this just in, no team with a moth on their cap has ever won  a World Series.  You're absolutely right, man.  I can't stand it.  I can't take it anymore.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  This is the year of the useless, you know, I'm cursing the computer because that's what's  I mean, they just, you know, they type it in, oh, let's see what needless stuff we can  say.  You know, you have to go back to 1945 to find a pitcher in a winning team of the World 
[00:07:30]  Series that actually tied his shoes in a double knot.  I said, I said, I said, just stop it.  This could shake up baseball as we know it.  Do they think that people are, are, are sitting in the homes going, wow, that's interesting.  How about this?  I'm watching the World Series and they're showing everyone's hot zone with the, yeah, the hot  zone.  Yeah, I'd like to see them put it on his crotch, you know?  Wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be just a terrific f*** up if they have a hot zone right  on the guy's f***ing crotch? 
[00:08:00]  And what's with all the sound effects they got to do when they put stats on the screen  on Fox?  Like all of a sudden it's like, all right, let's bring up his stats.  Shoot.  You're right.  And that f***er just goes.  Like sounds are coming out of it because they're trying to be so future.  Oh, yeah.  Flash and lights.  There's one good new thing.  There's one good new.  On ESPN, they actually have the first down line drawn across the field so you can actually 
[00:08:30]  see when the teams get the first down.  Have you seen that yet?  That's pretty handy.  Really?  We need that?  It makes it a little, uh, all right, never mind.  All right, guys.  See you later.  All right, brother.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  You too.  Even better than the real thing.  That was the song you had to be listening for to win the REM tickets for tonight.  A little, uh, treat for you guys that, uh, listen to us all the time because we announced  it after commercials for the gang, Anthony. 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  Uh, and I think for the rest of the show, we're moving on.  We're going to be giving away some Lenny Kravitz tickets.  Who's the winner on the REM tickets?  Let's see here.  Brian Scanlon of New Jersey.  Congratulations, Brian.  Enjoy REM tonight.  It's going to be a rocking show.  Rock.  Well, got an email here from Ken.  Ken, you're all right, actually.  Uh, you guys are funny as balls.  I listen every day and my coworkers think I'm a freak because I sit in my office laughing  out loud all by myself.  In addition to Opie's grammar problem, because we're working on that today. 
[00:09:30]  What about me?  No, it's all, this is all about me today.  They're going to pound me.  The one thing we're going to, um, work on today is, uh, people don't like when I say  me and Anthony.  Right, that's a big sticking point with people.  So today I'm going to try to say Anthony and I.  I'm going to try.  We'll see if, uh, I succeed.  But anyway, Ken writes, in addition to Opie's grammar problem, he uses the word actually  far too often.  I think I've opened up a can of worms with this grammar problem. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, brother.  He sounds like an effing Valley girl, for Christ's sake.  While you are working on your grammar, please work on that, too.  It's effing annoying.  Otherwise, keep up the good work.  F the ratings.  There are a lot of people pulling for you guys.  Rock on, Ken.  So, now I've got to worry about saying actually too much today.  And I can't say me and Anthony.  It's like when you learn golf.  There's a whole bunch of things you have to know, but you can't do them all at once.  Correct.  Yeah.  Correct. 
[00:10:30]  So I'm going to write my little, my little things down here that I'm going to work on  today.  Every day we're going to try to accomplish one or two of these things.  It all started yesterday because I used the word teach.  Oh, man.  Teach.  That was the worst.  Even my mom called and she was embarrassed for me.  Yeah.  So, I never liked what I was being teached in school.  I know.  Obviously, it's taught.  So, all right.  Anything on the instant feedback?  No.  Actually, I haven't even popped it up here.  Come on, guys. 
[00:11:00]  You're working.  You know, you might have something about the show.  It doesn't necessarily have to be anything we're talking about today.  It could be something that we discussed a couple weeks ago that finally touched a nerve  in you.  Yeah.  Just give us your comments.  We really enjoy the feedback you guys give us.  We're trying to build, believe it or not, the people's radio show here.  Where you can chime in with your thoughts.  And hopefully, we won't yell at you back.  The problem is we're trying to build this people's radio show, but we're turning a lot  of people off.  We get annoyed when you tell us what's on your mind. 
[00:11:30]  No, I'm kidding, of course.  We love your input.  No, I believe we could take it pretty well here.  Yes.  So, okay.  On the way, we got some Aerosmith, some Foreigner.  All right.  So, Anthony and I want to rock on now.  Kramer, how did this married woman get in my bed?  Opie and Anthony, 1027, N-E-W. 
[00:12:00]  1027, W-N-E-W.  Don't rock in New York with Patti Smith because the night for the Easter CD.  Sophie, it's Anthony.  What?  Remember the time that I discussed Patti Smith's hygiene and we got in trouble for that?  Her armpits.  Yes.  You think we've been here long enough where people can deal with that?  Well, that was early in our career.  In our Aerosmith career? 
[00:12:30]  In our little stint.  Here at NAW, yes.  Well, obviously, if you have the Easter CD, Patti Smith's on the front cover and she has hairy armpits.  And I commented that I personally don't like my women with hairy armpits.  And the women came out of the woodwork.  How dare you tell, you know, what you like in a woman?  Judging women by their hair under their armpits.  Who are you to say what a woman should wear and how.  Yeah, it was kind of ugly.  I mean, everyone out there can make believe that they actually fall in love with someone because of their personality. 
[00:13:00]  You fall in love with someone first by what you see.  And then you hope that they have a personality to match.  Well, I think you're attracted to somebody first.  All right, I shouldn't say fall in love, but you're attracted to someone by their looks first.  And then you hope they have a brain and some intelligence to them or some common interests.  Right.  But these people out there who think, you know, that they're above all this and they actually, you know, are attracted to someone's mind first. 
[00:13:30]  But there are guys that like hairy armpits.  Yes, of course.  And are attracted to that.  Of course.  You're just speaking personally.  I, one, don't like that look.  I agree.  And I just beg the women not to do that.  I don't like that either.  Because I don't want that style coming back.  That's what I don't want to see personally.  That's all.  That's all.  Point taken.  Okay.  We got some Lenny Kravitz tickets we're going to give away today.  He's playing Saturday Night at Roseland.  When you hear George Thorogood's bad to the bone, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027. 
[00:14:00]  So we've been discussing the Yankees.  They're going to pretty much win the World Series tonight.  I think we all know that by now.  Yeah, that's a given.  Looks like we'll have a parade Friday.  Just serves those Padres.  They paint their field.  Did you see that?  Their field was so bashed up and beat up from the football teams that they had to paint it.  Paint it green.  They put pretty little trees in the outfield.  And then they had the nerve to make fun of our stadium.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  And the field had seams where they tried to patch the grass together that if a ball got in there, forget about it. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  We'd take some kind of wacky Jupiter hop.  Well, George Steinbrenner wasn't happy.  He was on the field yesterday.  He was ticked off.  Doesn't matter.  No, not at all.  Didn't play on your crappy field and beat you.  But what I want to ask you, Anthony, after the game, did you watch Letterman?  No.  I missed Letterman.  You missed one of the best things ever.  What did he do?  Well, he did this whole bit on state fairs.  And you know how at state fairs someone grows the largest pumpkin and the largest gourds and the hog calling champion. 
[00:15:00]  I've seen that.  Well, he had all those people come out one by one, kind of like in the stupid pet trick format.  So they show the huge pumpkin that weighed like 600 pounds.  That was cute.  Then a guy came out with some gourds that were extra large.  I've seen those.  Then a hog calling lady comes out.  Then they bring out, was it Mr. Blue? 
[00:15:30]  I don't remember what it was called.  Yeah, I don't either.  But basically they brought out a pig.  Right.  That weighed close to 1,000 pounds.  That came up to your chest.  Really?  Probably.  They said like the largest pig in the world, basically.  And it's going to gain another 400 or 500 pounds.  Wow.  So it's on stage.  Big pig.  It's a big pig.  It was Mr. Blue or something like that.  Anyway, Big Blue.  Big Blue.  Okay.  So he's on stage and he's eating.  All of a sudden he turns to face the crowd. 
[00:16:00]  He had cooners.  Like the big red kickballs from Jim White.  Did anyone else see this?  I couldn't breathe at home.  I was laughing so hard.  What, his sack?  His sack was huger than the big red kickballs from Jim Klass.  And he's moving around the stage and they're just swaying and stuff.  And Letterman finally said, you know, I think you might have an endorsement there with jockey shorts.  Ah, they showed big pig sack on Letterman? 
[00:16:30]  It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV because it was just so ridiculously huge.  That's disgusting.  And the crowd is just laughing and laughing and just waiting for Letterman's line and he finally got one at the end there.  And then I tuned in Jay Leno and he's doing more Clinton jokes.  Ah.  Isn't that done?  I'm totally done.  Until they release some kind of story that Clinton had sex with Boy Scouts, I think it's pretty much over. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You know?  I think all the news is done.  But every night he's got to do at least one or two Clinton jokes.  Yeah.  He will not let it die.  Which is pretty pathetic.  And it amazes me that Jay Leno actually beats Letterman in the ratings.  I don't understand that.  With pig sack hanging down, I'm sure Letterman will be number one in no time again.  If I could show you this video, Ant, you wouldn't be able to breathe.  You'd be laughing so hard.  Did it look like when you used to chew up like three packs of Hubba Bubba and then pull it out of your mouth and let it just hang there? 
[00:17:30]  Is that what it looked like?  Pretty much.  Pig chewed up Hubba Bubba?  The pig must sit on him every time he lays down or sits down.  Five big buddies in your mouth.  They could pull it out and go...  Hanging down like that?  Pretty much.  So there you are.  Sorry I missed it.  I thought I would share that with you today.  Thank you.  Okay.  Maybe I could catch a video clip or something.  On the way, we got that new band Eve Six and coming back with some Tom Petty next. 
[00:18:00]  George, this broad husband wants to kill me.  Why did I ever get rid of that 19-year-old with the huge cans?  N-E-W.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  The Reich of New York.  That's the band Eve Six and Inside Out.  It's Opie and Anthony having a fine program thus far.  Yes.  Thus far is the word to use there, right, Anthony?  You could use that word, sure.  I was going to use so far, but I think thus far sounds more intelligent. 
[00:18:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you got something for the shoe.  Fax line is 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W.  Hi, what's up?  Oh, hi.  This is Tim from Brooklyn.  I was just listening to the guys on the radio goofing about Patti Smith.  Yeah.  When you guys first came on here, I don't know if it's one of the DJs,  he was talking that one of the guys was goofing on the other guy for dating a girl with a hairy back.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just want to...  That's all I want to say.  Well, wait a minute, because that was me.  Oh, okay.  You would have went dating a... 
[00:19:00]  No.  Well, what happened was...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm getting a bad rap about this.  No, no, you're not.  I lost my virginity to a girl that had, like, a mane growing down her back.  But she was okay.  See what you started, you idiot?  I remember that.  I hope he's telling everybody that he had sex with a girl that had a hairy back.  Well, I remember the story from when you guys first came on, that's all.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He's worried about girls with hairy armpits.  Oh, well, no, I've been listening to you guys since you came on. 
[00:19:30]  I've been listening to Danny W a long time, but I like you guys.  Well, let me...  Can I explain myself?  Go ahead, go ahead.  I didn't purposely search out a girl that had a mane growing down her back.  She was absolutely beautiful.  Am I going to be sorry I called?  I gave my virginity to this girl, but I didn't realize she had a hairy mane on her back until  I turned her over.  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  What are you going to do at that point?  Are you worried about armpits?  I don't know.  I live in Brooklyn.  There's a lot of hairy women.  Italian women, no less.  He told the girl, don't be shy. 
[00:20:00]  Take that black sweater off.  And she said, I'm not wearing a black sweater.  Giddle with me.  Giddle with me.  Okay.  All right, great.  So long.  No, really, thanks.  I appreciate you bringing that up to us.  Okay, goodbye.  It's really good.  Giddle with me.  Giddle with me, Opie.  Okay, you guys are good.  Goodbye.  Great.  Thanks, Ant.  I want to have a spelling bee. 
[00:20:30]  What?  A spelling bee?  Oh, now you've got to get on me?  Yeah, I'm a very lousy speller.  What can I say?  You know?  I feel like having a spelling bee.  Do I get to study?  Yes, you could study.  We'll get into that another day, I guess.  Yeah, my spelling is pretty bad.  Horrendous.  Sorry.  Remember how that lady used the word horrendous when she was describing my grammar yesterday?  And the day's spelling is horrendous. 
[00:21:00]  I think having a problem with grammar is a little worse than having a problem with spelling, Opie.  Well, I guess.  At least I could use the old spell check.  On the computer.  When I send emails.  Yeah, I don't have a grammar check.  No.  Great.  All right.  Stay tuned.  On the way.  Tragically Hip and George Thorogood.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Tragically Hip.  That's Poets from the Phantom Power CD and Lonesome George Thorogood before that. 
[00:21:30]  That's a song you had to be listening for to win the Lenny Kravitz tickets.  And John Schaefer of New York.  New York's got a pair of tickets to see Lenny this Saturday at Roseland.  Congratulations, John.  Next hour, you've got to be listening for Foghat's Slow Ride.  When you hear that, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  And you, too, will win a pair of tickets to see Lenny Kravitz.  All right?  Very good.  Hey, we've got Mark Golan coming in today.  I'm pretty excited about this.  I've been thumbing through Maxim Magazine. 
[00:22:00]  He's the editor-in-chief of Maxim Magazine.  Should be here momentarily.  Last time he was on the show, we had a lot of fun with him.  Mm-hmm.  And we're not putting him on just because he's the editor-in-chief of Maxim.  We're putting him on because the guy's completely out of his gourd.  Right?  He is a fun sort.  I'll tell you that much.  He's a trip.  There's a lot of creative energy that comes from this guy's head.  And we like to tap into it every once in a while and share it with you guys.  So, Jennifer Esposito on the cover, huh? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, she's pretty hot.  Yeah, she looks pretty good in these little pictures.  Every issue, they have a little centerfold pretty much.  And, uh...  Well, it's the guy magazine.  Sex, sports, beer, gadgets, clothes, and fitness.  Yes.  You know, also, you know who's going to be calling in today?  Oh.  Dice.  Dice?  Yeah.  What does he want?  I'm a little confused because usually Dice sits out in that lobby when we're on the air.  And he busts in from time to time.  Yeah.  With his wisdom. 
[00:23:00]  But, uh, today he's too busy to be here.  Busy?  I think he actually has something going on that he'll tell us all about.  And that's why he's calling in today instead of walking in from the lobby.  Usually he just sits out there waiting for us to call him in.  Can't wait to hear it.  Yeah, it should be exciting.  And if you've got something for the show, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  How are you?  All right.  Just a little information, you know, regarding the Patti Smith hair incident.  Yes.  I had a blind date with a girl about two months ago. 
[00:23:30]  Completely gorgeous.  Dropped dead.  Could have been a model.  We go out.  I buy her dinner.  Take her out for a couple of drinks.  Coerce her to come back to my apartment.  Start fooling around.  You know, I get the pants down.  She had a bush that went from one side to the next.  It's like a pair of hip waders she had on.  I'm telling you.  Like she could have went in the water and nothing would have got wet.  You know what we call that, don't you?  Runaway.  No, the 70s Earth Mama Muff.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you.  Did it look like she was making Jiffy Pop popcorn in her underpants? 
[00:24:00]  Ugh, it was disgusting.  Did it look like she had Link from the Mod Squad's head in a leg lock?  Yeah.  It looked like she had Kelly Savalas' hairpiece on before.  He figured he might as well just go bald.  Or he had a little William Shatner down there.  But let me tell you, she was drop-dead gorgeous.  I couldn't believe it.  Well, that's coming back.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Please, if that's coming back, I don't know what I'm doing.  Because let me say, the hair under the arms and the hair on the body, you guys are right.  It just doesn't do it for me.  What is this?  Get this out of here. 
[00:24:30]  Well, you know, but the problem is, if we discuss this on the air, then you get women  out there that are mad at us for discussing our likes and dislikes.  Isn't it unbelievable?  Doesn't everybody have likes and dislikes about men, right?  Exactly.  And doesn't everybody, aren't everybody entitled to an opinion, which doesn't have to be the  same as everyone else's?  Well, you would think that, but...  You would.  In this politically correct world we live in, you're not allowed to have an opinion.  You know what it is?  The women that are calling you up, they're the ones with the big bushes.  Well, actually, let's play fair today. 
[00:25:00]  We'll have a few women call up and tell us what they don't like about guys.  Yeah, have them berate us.  All right, man.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York with Steve Miller.  It's Opie and Anthony.  On the way, we're going to be talking to Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh, yeah.  Do we even need to tease the fact that we're going to be talking to him, Anthony?  Oh, no, no.  He's a huge star.  I think everybody knows who he is.  Well, actually, if you know the history of Dice with our show, he's been hanging out  in the lobby since we started here at NEW four months ago because he really doesn't 
[00:25:30]  have a life in everyone as well.  He barges into the studio, you know, to try to get some air time to try to get his popularity  back.  Get his plugs in.  We noticed that he wasn't around the last couple of days and we found out why because  he's going to be on Dharma and Greg tonight.  That hot TV show.  Wow, yeah.  Have you ever watched Dharma and Greg?  I think I watched the first episode.  And that was it?  That was pretty much it.  Yeah.  So Dice wants to plug his little appearance tonight on TV. 
[00:26:00]  I read in the TV Guide, yeah, Dice is doing a cameo on it and he's playing himself.  There's a stretch.  That's going to be real cute.  Which Dice is it going to be if he's playing himself?  Is it the angry Dice that everybody remembers when he used to maybe be funny in 1986?  Or is it the Dice from the TV show where he was the postal employee and he had the little  cute kids coming up to him and, you know, he'd have cute little banter with them?  Or is it the Dice from the failed, his other failed show, Hits?  Hits.  Oof. 
[00:26:30]  Oof.  Well, we'll talk to Dice and we'll find out all about it.  Sure.  All right.  What do you think of Dice, Mark?  We got Mark Golan in the studio, the editor-in-chief of Maxim Magazine.  Yeah, yeah.  That's Dharma and Greg Brady, isn't it?  The show.  Yeah.  Now that might be interesting, though.  That would be a lot of fun to see.  That was it.  Yes.  Do, do, do.  Yeah.  So.  Well, you were so excited last time we had you on the air, we decided to have you back.  But it won't work a second time, will it?  You don't think so? 
[00:27:00]  We could give it a whirl.  We could give it a whirl.  We'll try.  We'll take a swing at it.  We'll try.  If nothing else, we'll thumb through Maxim.  There we go.  Thumb through it.  See what kind of hijinks you've been up to for the past month.  This time I don't have to beg for beer, I brought my own.  I noticed that, because the listeners last time let you down, they didn't bring your  beer until seven o'clock.  So we expect you to be extra funny today, because you do have your beer.  That was super funny.  So I haven't even been able to thumb through the latest issue of Maxim Magazine.  What can I expect from this month's issue, Mark?  You know, lots of stuff. 
[00:27:30]  Same old thing.  You know?  Different things.  Is there a theme this month?  There's no theme this month.  It's sort of our general kind of look at the world in general.  We've got...  I like that.  We've got a little report on Russia, where they're losing atomic bombs and strip clubs and...  Wait, strip clubs in Russia?  Oh, there's this great one.  This is the best.  There's this club.  It's called the Hungry Duck.  And what they do is they let a whole bunch of women in early, and they have male strippers 
[00:28:00]  that whip these women into an orgiastic frenzy, and I'm really proud of that phrase, orgiastic  frenzy.  Is that a word?  And then when they're really hot, they let guys in.  The women pay like two rubles to get in.  The guys pay 30 bucks.  By the time the guys get in, the women are ripping their clothes off.  Wow.  How about that?  And let's see what else.  That's what's going on over there in Russia.  Let's see.  There's Red Square.  I see in Bessel Cathedral, all that kind of crap.  But there's also this restaurant where, it's a huge restaurant, you sit at tables, and 
[00:28:30]  in the middle of the restaurant, there's this glass-encased farm with an old lady tending  goats.  So you just, you sit there and you eat dinner, and watch her clean up goat crap.  Come on.  I'm serious.  They've really lost any sense of reality over there.  It's in print.  It means it's true.  In the former Soviet Union.  They're missing atomic bombs?  Yeah.  About, they've misplaced about 100 suitcase-sized atomic bombs over the last few years. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, that's just lovely to hear.  This is the best one.  The Russian army down south, they took, you know, they sent all their uniforms out to  be cleaned.  They didn't have money to pay for the cleaning services, so they have no uniforms.  The laundry's like, no, we're not returning them.  This is, this is so scary.  This is a mess.  And then Boris Yeltsin's all drunk and stuff all over the place.  He's ready to drop dead.  Right, right.  We have started the Boris Yeltsin, you know, Death Watch.  Yeah.  I think he's going to be out by, at the end of the year. 
[00:29:30]  I saw him wavering.  You need a big clock in here or something.  You want like a clock?  Little vodka bottles instead of numbers.  For Boris?  Sure.  For Boris.  Boris Death Clock.  What else can you tell us about Russia that's in the magazine this month?  Let's see.  Let's just thumb to it.  Well, later on, I want to talk about if men really ruled the world, too.  We'll get to that.  That's my personal favorite on this issue.  This is just right on the money.  All right.  Well, we're just getting warmed up.  How's that?  Yeah.  Mark's hanging with us today.  If you got something, 212-757-1027.  What are you laughing at, Ant?  Just one quick instance of if men really ruled the world. 
[00:30:00]  I love the movies, how movies would change.  Before the bridges of Madison County.  After the F-14s of Madison County.  We talk about that a lot.  It's a touching love story.  We'll get into chick flicks with you, Mark, in a little while, okay?  Absolutely.  But up next, we're going to be talking to Dice, supposedly, live from Hollywood.  Stay right there.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Another track from Trax.  That's Bruce Springsteen, Where the Bands Are. 
[00:30:30]  The box set comes out November 10th.  And we've got something really cool for you guys.  NEW presents a world premiere Bruce Springsteen box set listening party.  That's going to happen next week at the Hard Rock Cafe, October 27th.  So, next Tuesday, and what you've got to do is listen to WNEW to find out how you can be there.  Oh, brother.  I've got to introduce everyone.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's our pal Mark Golan from Maxim Magazine, the editor-in-chief.  What are you laughing at over there?  Somebody sent a little cute little story about the hairy armpit issue that we were talking about earlier. 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  On the topic of hairy pits, a drunk and a woman are sitting on opposite ends of the bar.  The drunk is ordering drinks as the woman with the hairy pits is waving over the bartender.  The drunk says, give me a beer and whatever the ballerina's having.  The bartender says, how do you know she's a ballerina?  To which the drunk replies, anyone who could get her leg that high has to be a ballerina. 
[00:31:30]  Thanks, Joe.  From Bayonne.  That's a good one.  Shades of Oscar Wilde there.  You've got to love it.  Very nice.  That's our listeners.  We're proud of them.  Hell yeah.  In a little bit, we're going to discuss if men really ruled the world with Mark from Maxim Magazine.  There's some really funny stuff in here.  We'll get to that.  But right now, we've got to get to Andrew Dice Clay's on our phone line right now.  Oh, joy.  This is the loser line, I guess.  A new feature on the Opie and Anthony show, the loser line.  We'll have one loser a week call us. 
[00:32:00]  All right?  But Dice is going to be on a TV show tonight, and he wants to plug his little gig.  Oh, great.  Can't wait.  And usually, he hangs out in our lobby, you know, praying for some airtime.  We were wondering where he's been.  Yeah, he's been gone for the last couple of days, but I guess he's been filming a sitcom.  Oh.  Let's talk to the Dice man.  Oh, hi, Dice.  Hey, is this Jake Hoffman, Snap Ahead?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  You in New York trying to get that loser radio show going, huh?  Well, where are you?  I'm in Hollywood, baby. 
[00:32:30]  What are you doing in Hollywood?  I'm starring on a big sitcom.  I'm starring.  What, what, Frazier?  No, Dice man.  You never heard of it?  Oh, you mean Dice man.  Oh, it's Dice man.  Now, I'm going to be big on this show.  Guys, I hate to tell you, but no one watches that show.  Listen, Snap Ahead.  No one listens to your show.  I'm in Hollywood.  I'm on a TV show.  Wait a second.  We seem to be showing that you're calling from Branson, Missouri. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, who's that loser, huh?  It's Margo.  I got to, I got to put up with this.  Got a street snap ahead in there.  Look, the truth of the matter is, the Dice man is back.  I'm in Hollywood.  I'm making TV shows.  Where are you, huh?  Hey, Dice, wait a minute.  This is Anthony.  You want to hear my impression of you?  Yeah, go ahead.  Let's hear this.  Hey, this is Dice man.  I used to be somebody,  but now I can't even sell out a closet.  Oh!  Oh, yeah, that's real good, huh? 
[00:33:30]  Oh, that sounds fantastic.  Just like me.  What an ass.  So, Dice, when are you going to be back  so you can get us our coffee  after your cute little TV appearance?  Hey, that's real funny, huh?  You ought to be a comedian.  Say what you want.  I'm in Hollywood.  I'm making TV shows.  Where are you, huh?  Where are you, huh?  I'll tell you where you are.  Nowheres.  This is Nowheres, all of you.  I'm back.  The Dice man's back.  I got the leather jacket  with the studs on the back  that says the Dice man. 
[00:34:00]  Are you going to be doing any rhymes  tonight on the TV show?  I don't need no rhymes no more.  I'm a big star.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm a big star.  Yeah, you're a loser.  On the Weather Channel.  Yeah, real funny.  Keep it up there.  It's not bad.  You're not calling from Hollywood.  You're calling from Allentown.  What, you got caller ID?  Yeah, well, something screwed up  with the connection.  Hey, Dice, wasn't Jimmy Walker  available for your part  on this show?  We need you back here  to make us coffee.  It's no more getting you anything.  I'm a big star now. 
[00:34:30]  Who's that?  Jenna Elfhead  that's doing that  Dom and Greg show.  She came up to me.  She goes,  Oh, Dice,  I need you for my show.  My ratings are real bad.  I said,  Honey,  I'll come on your show.  You just got to bend over  and let me get a buggy.  You're a mess.  That's how the Dice Man  makes it, huh?  Yeah, that's real funny stuff, Dice.  Can't wait to see it tonight.  Hey, can I plug it, yo?  Yeah, go ahead.  And I'm going to be  at a laugh  till you crop your pants  coincidentally enough 
[00:35:00]  in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  All right.  All right, loser.  Hey, Anthony wants  to say goodbye to you.  Yeah, I'll say goodbye  to you in a rhyme.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  I ain't been funny  since 86.  Oh, buggy.  Oh, yeah, that's funny.  Yeah, sounds just like me, loser.  Goodbye.  I'm in Hollywood.  Goodbye, you're nowheres.  Yeah, whatever.  Bye, guys.  Oh.  What a loser.  Got a cameo role as himself. 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  We got to get the clip of it.  We'll play it tomorrow  and abuse him.  Oh, we definitely will.  Everyone's got to watch  the show tonight.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW,  The Rock of New York.  Stone Temple Pilots  and plush.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's our pal,  Mark Golan  from Maxim Magazine,  the editor-in-chief.  And we're checking out  the latest issue  of Maxim Magazine.  There's some great stuff  in this issue.  Every month,  there's some great stuff, though.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun. 
[00:36:00]  I'm looking at the section  of men really ruled  the world, Anthony.  Well, we like to think  we do, right?  Yeah, well, it's true.  And in fact,  I'm already getting  a little bit of crap  about this.  It's like, Mark,  we do rule the world.  And I realized,  the moment I realized  when we didn't  was I was in the supermarket  and the first aisle  in every supermarket  is always produce.  The vegetables.  I'm thinking, hey,  if we ruled the world,  it would be the pork  on a stick  and cheese doodle aisle.  Right?  But no, it's vegetables.  It's always vegetables. 
[00:36:30]  That's when I realized  my whole world  was falling apart there.  It's like,  we don't rule the world.  No, not at all.  There's some very funny  ones in here, Mark.  Yeah, so we basically  got together and decided,  okay, well,  if we really did  rule the world,  if we just completely  ignored the wisdom  of our moms,  our girlfriends,  our wives,  nuns,  what would the world  be like?  And here are a couple  of the things  that we came up with.  In sex and relationships,  number one,  nodding and looking  at your watch  would be deemed  an acceptable response 
[00:37:00]  to I love you.  Speaking solely  in Clint Eastwood quotes  would count as opening up.  This one I really love.  When your girlfriend  really needed to talk  to you during the game,  she'd appear in a little box  in the corner of the screen  during a time out.  Oh, now you're getting it.  And it'd also be  one of those people there  like doing the  deaf sign language.  Yeah, yeah.  What else?  Oh, this one's good too.  When women climaxed,  they'd make a noise  like a pinball machine. 
[00:37:30]  You know that  when you win a free game?  Yeah, that knock.  Is that the most  satisfying sound  in the world or what?  When you would just  roll in and that ball  is going to be  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Yep.  Bing, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And all of a sudden,  oh yeah.  And you know everybody  in the bowling alley  is looking at you.  Free ball, yes.  Free game.  And then, oh,  this one's good too.  Breaking up would be  a lot easier.  A smack on the ass  and a nice hustle  you'll get them next time  would pretty much do it.  So, that's sex  and relationship. 
[00:38:00]  Then at work,  things that would be  different there  at any time  and for any reason,  you'd be allowed  to build a campfire  in your office.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Ties would still be required  but they'd be made  of beef jerky.  And this is what I love too.  At the end of the work day,  a whistle would sound  and you'd jump out  your window  and slide down  the tail of a brontosaurus  and right into your car  like Fred Stank.  This is all  if men really rule the world.  I like how movies  would change.  Ah, that's good too, yeah.  The English patient  would become  the French maid. 
[00:38:30]  That's good.  Like the horse whisperer  would be the horse juggler  with a gun.  Anything with a gun,  I've figured out  it's acceptable.  Yes, no, it's pretty, yeah.  Yeah.  And as far as sports goes,  the only show opposite  Monday Night Football  would be Monday Night Football  from a different camera angle.  Yeah.  My favorite probably  in the entire thing is  men would take control  of women's magazines  and we did this thing  called Max and Wiesel.  And here's like a couple  of the cover lines.  Okay.  Threesomes,  are you missing the boat? 
[00:39:00]  He lies, he cheats,  what are you doing wrong?  And if he's getting  enough time away from you.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, the ones from Cosmo  are completely ridiculous.  Yeah, how to find your G-spot  and all that fun stuff.  So here's something  I think Opie could relate to.  Uh-oh, where are you going?  No, this is elevator  closed door buttons  would be responsive  to the point of injury.  You know how you always, 
[00:39:30]  Opie hates getting  anybody else in the elevator.  Yeah.  And he'll sit there  and hit the closed door button  20 times  and you're waiting  for it to close.  It's not a closed door button.  It's something to do  while the door closes  on its own.  Actually,  a guillotine button  would be great.  Like for those people  that like reach their arm in,  like you're almost there.  You're almost gliding up  and some jackass  reaches his arm in there  and just boom.  That would be very good.  I like this one too.  You could murder any man  who draws a distinction  between heat and humidity. 
[00:40:00]  You are messed up, Mark.  Hey, come on.  Yeah, it's not that it's hot.  It's just so close,  you know,  it's so muggy.  Do you feel damp?  I feel damp.  I feel a little moist.  All right, more with Mark  and Opie and Anthony  if you've got something to add.  212-757-1027.  On the way,  we've got some holes.  Stay there.  Elaine,  my new girlfriend  gave me a handjob  and a wedding ring 
[00:40:30]  gave me a rash.  1027-WNEW,  the Rock of New York  with Hull,  that celebrity skin  and Foghat before that.  That's the song  you had to be listening for  to win the tickets  to see Lenny Kravitz  this weekend at Roseland.  And Sherry from New Jersey  was paying attention  and she has a pair of tickets.  Yes, congratulations, Sherry. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, a little Freudian slip there.  She has a pair of tickets.  Well, she has that too.  Okay.  It's Opie, it's Anthony  and it's our pal Mark Golan  from Maxim Magazine  hanging with us  once again today.  And we're going through  the latest issue  of Maxim Magazine  and there's a very,  very funny section here.  You're sick.  Kids read  the darndest things, Mark.  What's that all about?  Well, it's, you know,  so many of the  classic children's books  we were raised on  were written so long ago  that we figured  it was time to 
[00:41:30]  update them a little bit.  This is what he does.  This is what he does for a living.  This is what we do  all day long.  I thought our jobs  were fun, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think he has a better job  than us.  What can we take  that's clean and pure  and twist it  and throw mud on it?  And this time  it was children's books.  So here's a few  of the ones  that we think  should be printed now.  Okay.  Daddy drinks  because you cry.  All dogs go to hell.  By Curious George. 
[00:42:00]  Very good.  I like that one.  I like this one.  What is that dog  doing to that other dog?  Some kittens can fly.  And then we start  it goes down from there.  Oh, great.  It burns when I pee,  Charlie Brown.  Why grandma's not moving.  Don't stop feeding  the fish.  Hell,  where little kids  go who don't  brush their teeth.  Yes. 
[00:42:30]  And how the Grinch  knocked over  the 7-Eleven.  Charlie and the Fudge,  Colonel.  Now you've gone  too far.  I was trying  to be tasteful  here and skip  over that  for public  consumption.  I don't even get that.  What do you even  mean by that?  Oh, man.  All right, Mark.  Very good.  You should see  the illustrations.  Yeah.  Well, Mark  off mic was discussing  something he wants  to do in a future  magazine. 
[00:43:00]  The Top 100 Albums.  Oh, yeah.  Because our listeners  could help you out  with that, actually.  Well, no.  You know what?  Actually, what I want  the listeners to help  me out with is we're  going to be working  on this piece called  100 Stupid Things  to Do When You're Bored.  And we just started  working on it and some  of the things that  we've come up with.  This is one that  I've actually tried.  I keep a book of these,  actually.  And the one that I  really love is you  go to a Burger King  and you go up to the  counter and you ask  directions to another  Burger King.  And they'll take 
[00:43:30]  like 15 minutes  trying to explain to  you that they all  have the same food.  And you keep going,  I know.  I just want a  different one.  And they lose their  minds.  Or another one is,  you know, when you're  sitting in a room in a  meeting, this is good  to do at work and  somebody's talking to  you, you put your  finger to your lips  and then you write on  a piece of paper and  you hold it up and it  says, I think the room  is bugged.  Do you want our  listeners to help you  out with this?  Absolutely.  I want things to do  when you're bored.  Somebody, uh,  somebody sent me  one. 
[00:44:00]  Uh, basically you go  down to the street and  you invite people to  come up to your  apartment to see your  butter carving of the  Virgin Mary.  Oh, wow.  And then you bring  them up and then when  they see this plate of  just melted butter, you  start whimpering and  you start like praying  to the ceiling.  So how many times a  week do you do acid,  Mark?  All right.  Our listeners can't  help you out.  Yeah, please.  Call in.  Things you do when  you're bored.  Or you could fax  them to us.  212-957-WNEW.  You might be in a  future issue of 
[00:44:30]  Maxim Magazine.  That would be very  cool.  Yep.  We'll make you famous.  All right.  More with Mark in a  bit.  Stay there.  Hey, Anthony, we  need to take a minute  and talk about  MindSpring.  Internet access.  A very cool  internet access.  They got fast,  reliable 56K  connections.  How cool is that  when you're tooling  around the internet,  Anthony?  Well, you need that.  You know me, Opie.  I'm a computer hound.  And if I connected  anything less than 56,  what do I do?  You throw your  computer out the  window?  I throw it against  the wall and start  stepping on it.  You're pretty much  buying computers every  week because you  don't have that 
[00:45:00]  connection.  Well, you know,  when you're downloading  the good stuff off  the internet, video,  you need something  fast.  You get 26 and  stuff and you're  sitting there waiting  and waiting.  And MindSpring  guarantees the fast,  reliable 56K  connections.  Also, they got free  customer support 24  hours a day, seven  days a week, toll  free.  So pretty much it's  easy to get them on  the line when you're  having a problem with  your internet connection.  Here's me.  With my old internet  access company.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, I need help. 
[00:45:30]  Please hold.  Okay, now if we can  all just sit here and  wait until 8 o'clock,  I could do the rest  of this.  Yeah, exactly.  Another cool thing  about MindSpring,  you can call them  toll free at 1-888-MSPRING  and tell them that  Opie and Anthony  sent you and MindSpring  will waive the $25  startup fee and give  you the first 30 days  of service free from  the day you sign up.  It's that easy.  Use that $25 to get  to the porno sites.  There you go.  1027-WNAW,  The Rock of New York,  Matchbox 20 and  push.  It's Opie and Anthony 
[00:46:00]  and Mark Golan from  Maxim Magazine hanging  with us once again  today.  Also got to remind you  later on this hour,  we're going to play  Thin Lizzy's The Boys  Are Back in Town.  When we do,  be the 10th caller  at 212-757-1027  to pick up some  Lenny Kravitz tickets  for the show at  Roseland this Saturday  night, okay?  And Mark is  encouraging our  listeners to get  involved here because  they could possibly be  in a future issue  of Maxim Magazine.  That's right.  Things, stupid things  to do when you're  bored.  And we got a fax  here. 
[00:46:30]  A guy writes,  grab a friend and  a roll of quarters,  go down to the  local laundromat and  take turns getting in  the dryer and going  for dryer rides.  Come on.  Remember to keep  the heat off.  Air dry only.  This might be a  future issue.  You never know.  If you want to  add to the list,  you can fax us.  212-957-WNEW.  Hi, NEW.  I got an idea.  You got something  to do on your  board?  Yes.  It's also a time  saver for everybody  else.  Okay.  How handy.  You go down to  the bank and you  fill in your account 
[00:47:00]  number and all the  blank deposits  lists.  Now you're  thinking.  Hey, it's  safe time for  everyone.  Very good.  Excellent.  Thank you, man.  You're welcome.  I think we're on  to something here,  Mark.  Wait a second.  The last time I  was here, did we  talk about the  porn booth thing?  The porn booth.  I'm not sure.  This is one that we  used to do when we  were really bored,  was you go down to  a porn shop with the  booths for the  movies and you bring 
[00:47:30]  a jar of mayonnaise  with you.  Oh, yeah, we did.  Can we talk about it?  Do it again, though.  We're gaining new  listeners every day.  Go ahead.  You take one of those  basting things with you  that you slather on  barbecue sauce and you  go inside and you  slather it on the  inside doorknob and  then you leave.  Then you just stand  there and wait and  some poor schmuck  walks in there.  He puts his quarters  in and so on.  Then he tries to  leave.  He puts his hand on  the doorknob.  You hear like a  little, eh.  Then there's like five  minutes of silence and 
[00:48:00]  then you hear this  like, eh, hello?  Can somebody let me  out?  Very nice.  A lot of guys doing  it.  Oh, too funny.  What else were we  going to discuss here?  There's so much.  There's so much.  Well, there was the  third grade.  We started getting  misty-eyed and  nostalgic while the  music was playing,  right?  Yeah.  What were you saying?  Wait, no, wait.  What were you saying  about third grade,  though?  Because I remember 
[00:48:30]  doing this.  Actually.  All right.  Well, everybody's  going to have to  pony up one if I  tell this one.  Okay.  This is, you're on  the school bus and  you decide you're  going to spit on  somebody.  Just because.  Among other  things.  Just because.  And it being  third grade, you  have to go for  the gusto.  So we used to  have like this  25-minute school  bus ride and you  just sit there in  the back and you  start like saving  up spit, you know,  minute after minute  and it'd be  collecting and your  cheeks would start  bulging out. 
[00:49:00]  You'd be like, you'd  be a saliva gerbil  basically.  You know, you have a  little bit that you're  allowing yourself to  swallow but you keep  the rest of it and by  the end of like 20-25  minutes you're  practically throwing  up and then you get  off the bus and you  walk up to the person  and you try and go  hey but it comes out  like bleh.  And they turn around and  you get up really close  and just dump it all on  them.  The stupid things you  did in third grade.  Mine actually involves  saliva also.  It was the...  What a coincidence. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  It was, well, it's  because it's third  grade.  That's most of...  You have so few  things that you're  disposal.  Exactly.  You're not an adult.  You don't have money.  You don't have any  possessions.  You have you and your  spit.  If you can't make it  yourself, forget it.  That's it.  You're self-contained.  But when you used to  pin somebody down and  especially right after  chocolate milk and you'd  go, hey, and get this  line of spit going out of  your mouth down, just  about touching the nose  and then suck it back  up again.  Wait a minute. 
[00:50:00]  Don't shake me.  Don't shake your ass.  Good boy.  Back up again.  The old pit and  pendulum.  And it would work  great after like  Nestle's quick.  Oh, yeah.  Just very viscous.  Actually, Anthony, I  got a friend, Glenn  Notis.  He was on David  Letterman.  He did a trick with  his saliva where he  would stand up, right?  And he would do the  saliva thing.  He would have to drink  orange soda.  He would be able to  get the spit all the  way down to the floor,  pick up a piece of  popcorn and suck it  all up into his mouth.  Like a dragonfly, 
[00:50:30]  like a frog catching  a dragonfly.  Yeah.  He was on Letterman  doing this trick and  the old Howard Stern  show on Channel 9.  Wow.  A real good friend of  mine.  Yeah.  That's a talent.  There's a resident.  You know, it's a  resume stuffer.  It's going to be a  hero still walk the  planet.  Yeah, of course.  Well, the only thing I  did in third grade was  like just eat the big  white paste for lunch  money.  Oh, the paste?  Yeah.  You know, it tasted  good, though.  You were the paste  eater?  Yeah, I was the paste  eater.  It took you a while to  work your way out of  third grade.  And then there was the 
[00:51:00]  glue of the rubber  cement boogers you  would make.  You know, you put it  on the desk and let it  dry a little and roll it  up and go, ew, ew, put  it by your nose, ew,  rubber cement booger.  And then you would pull  it out and wipe it on  someone and they'd freak  out.  See, now you are getting  misty.  You told me you were  going to choke up a  little bit.  Okay, this one's going  to make me break out in  tears.  Did anybody ever snort a  pixie stick?  Remember a pixie stick?  Remember those?  The grape.  The grape.  It's like grape.  You snort one of those  purple haze.  It's playing on the  inside of your brain. 
[00:51:30]  It's unbelievably painful.  It's like you'd snort one  off and then you'd just  sit there and go, oh,  God, ow, and then you'd  do it again.  I wonder what orange  would be like.  And it hurts just as  much.  No, man, you've got to  crush up the Nico  wafers.  Yeah, now you're  talking.  You used to, like,  play priest in the  schoolyard with that.  Here you go, Nico.  Oh, a black one.  Body of Christ.  Body of Christ.  Very nice. 
[00:52:00]  All right, we've got  more with Mark on the  way.  Also some great rock and  roll.  We've got the latest  from Dave Matthews and  Queen next.  Hey, Anthony, I've got a  song for the San Diego  Padres.  What's that?  Another one, Vice  the Dust.  That's insane.  Wacky.  It's a norificult, but  you're making a wacky  dedication.  You're insane.  1027 WNEW, the rock  of New York.  1027 WNEW, the rock of  New York, the latest from  the Dave Matthews band.  That's Crush.  You're hanging with Opie and  Anthony and Mark Golan from 
[00:52:30]  Maxim Magazine.  We love Maxim Magazine and  we like Mark.  Not because you're the  editor-in-chief of Maxim,  because you're so bizarre.  Well, he fits right in here.  Oh, you totally fit in with  our show and we like to have  him on like once a month  because I don't think any of  us can handle it more than  once a month, you know?  The nightmare begins again.  Yeah, but the listeners are,  you're sparking some stuff in  the listeners and we like  that.  And the phones are ringing  like crazy.  I think we should go to a few  of them here.  Hi, N.E.W. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right, you enjoying the  show today?  Yeah, I'm loving it.  I love this.  Hey, we had one called the  MFPP, or the motherfucking  proverbial prophylactic.  What we used to do is we used  to take a condom and we used  to put it in a place that was  very undesirable, but unknown.  What a friend of mine did to  me was he took this and he put  it in my mayonnaise jar in my  refrigerator.  And I had a girl come over and  we were going out to the beach 
[00:53:30]  and I was making sandwiches and  slap right on a piece of bread.  So what we did to him to get him  back was we actually put it in  his bowling ball.  And we were bowling in a  championship league and he came  down the alley and dropped the  ball halfway down the alley.  This thing came out.  And that's what we used to do  for fun as kids.  Oh, that's good.  He brought up a very pertinent  thing, which is escalation.  That was it.  And no one was safe.  What do you mean you did that 
[00:54:00]  as kids?  I want to do this this weekend.  That was more college stuff,  but we used to have a lot of  fun with it.  Oh, very good.  Hey, guys, listen, I love your  show.  You all be cool, all right?  Thank you.  All right, be good.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, when we were kids.  All right, yesterday.  Yeah, right?  Well, no one wants to admit they  have the mentality of a kid  still.  You know, for some reason,  society has decided you have  to grow up and have  responsibility and you're not  supposed to have fun anymore  after you hit a certain age.  Yeah.  We say screw that. 
[00:54:30]  It's crushing our creativity.  Yeah, isn't it?  I think we should play the  condom game all over New York  and people start calling in  with the most unusual place  they left a condom.  Why not?  Why not?  Let the games begin.  Yeah, so let's take  another call here.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  What do you got?  This O.P. and Anthony?  Yes.  Wow.  I can't believe I got through.  Cool.  Hey, I've been listening to you  guys for the last couple of  weeks.  I think you guys are doing a  great job.  I don't know where they're  getting all this other crap  that you're coming in dead 
[00:55:00]  last.  I can't believe that.  Well, we're not even going to  worry about that anymore.  I know.  We're moving forward.  I was just driving home and I  heard you guys talking about  practical jokes, things to do  what you can do to keep  yourself from being bored.  Yes.  I got the ultimate.  Okay.  Okay.  Something me and a couple  army buddies used to do when  we used to drive back and  forth to different bases.  take a whoopee cushion and  you go into a bathroom and  one of the highways.  Yeah.  And you go into one of the  stalls and you start blowing 
[00:55:30]  up the whoopee cushion and  you just start cracking out  some wind out of the thing  while you're grunting and  screaming your brains out  inside one of them.  People will run out of the  bathroom laughing hysterically.  And while you're driving,  after you leave and you're  driving down the highway,  you'll still see people with  tears in their eyes laughing  their brains out as you're  driving down the highway.  That is good.  You've got to yell out  and, oh, dear Lord.  Hey, I do it like six times  out of the year.  It's just feeling like  everything's falling down  on top of you.  Oh, God. 
[00:56:00]  You just get in the  bathroom and you go, ah,  ah, ah.  It's absolutely the best  thing you can do to  cheer yourself up.  God, I swear I'll never  eat that again.  Just get me through this  one, please.  God is my witness.  I'll never eat  Mexican again.  They run out of the  bathroom with tears  in her eyes.  I saw one guy  ran out of the  bathroom with his  pants still down.  He couldn't even  pull it up.  Anyone in here,  run.  Save yourselves.  It's even better 
[00:56:30]  if you bring a little  glass of water  and just spill it on  the floor.  All right, man.  There we go, God.  It's fine.  Keep up the great work.  Thanks.  Everybody in the  fire department  down here is  listening to you.  Thank you.  Putting on the  ceiling.  Start lobbing it  out of the stall.  You guys still  here?  Oh, yeah, we are.  This is what we call  our radio show.  It's a mess. 
[00:57:00]  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  The listeners are  coming up with some  funny stuff today,  huh?  Tinty more beef stew.  That has got to be the  one that would work  the best.  Oh, wham!  And just throw it  against the ceiling.  All right, there's  another game we can  start in New York,  you guys.  The fun bathroom  game.  Why not?  Bye, N.E.W.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  We love you.  Listen, I got a good  one for you.  Okay.  You take a candy bar  and you rub it all 
[00:57:30]  over your hands.  I heard a comedian  say this.  You rub it all  over your hands  and you put it  underneath the  stall, bathroom,  and ask them if  they got toilet paper.  I am so proud  the ladies are  coming aboard.  Oh, how about  this one?  Putting hand cream  in a water gun  and going into  a porno flick  and squirting it  behind someone's  head in front of  you.  Oh, God! 
[00:58:00]  I think Pee Wee  did that, huh?  Yeah, right?  I bring my own  water gun!  That was in a  puff dispenser!  All right, thanks  for participating.  I tell everyone  to listen to you guys.  We appreciate that.  All right, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  As we continue  our downward slide.  Bye.  1027 WNEW, The Rock  of New York, Thin  Lizzy, the boys  are back in town.  It's Opie, it's  Anthony, and it's  Mark Golan from  Maxim Magazine.  The November issue  will be out any day 
[00:58:30]  now, right, Mark?  Yep.  We barely talked  about the magazine.  We always digress  when you come into  our studio, but  that's okay.  It's fine.  We like this.  Who needs rampant  commercialism anyway?  Know what I liked  from the October issue?  You had a whole  article on trick-or-treating  and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  I could totally relate  to all the stuff  that you had in that  magazine.  When you were a kid,  the kind of houses  that you used to go  up to, and...  Crap you'd get.  The crap you'd get.  Yeah.  You know, there'd  always be...  There'd be the  dentist's house, right? 
[00:59:00]  And you would get  floss.  The floss.  They would either  give you floss  or apples.  Right, or like an  apple and a  toothbrush for after.  Yeah.  I hate when they  try to get their  ideology on you  like that, you know?  Just give me the  wrapped chocolate  candy.  That's all I care  about.  Gum.  Bazooka Joe bubble  gum, thank you.  You know what?  The big score,  though, was like  ding-dongs, you  know, like the  real cake stuff.  Except then your  mom would look at  it for about half  an hour to see if  there were any  needle punctures  in there. 
[00:59:30]  Well, that's always  a fun thing to do,  too.  On Halloween day,  you go to the  supermarket and buy  nothing but apples  and razor blades  and go right up to  the thing and go,  this will be all  thank you.  That's all for me.  And then you have  to count to make  sure you have  enough apples  and enough.  Wait a second,  you need one more  razor blade.  I'm going to talk  to yourself online  the whole time.  Where are your  straight pins?  I also need  straight pins.  You know what's  really interesting?  It's the only time  they talk about 
[01:00:00]  Christmas and the  holiday season and  how everybody comes  out and you get to  know everybody and  you all get closer  and so on.  No way.  It's Halloween.  You find out what  your parents think  about the other  parents on the block  because you come  back and you got an  apple.  This is a person  that they borrowed  the lawnmower,  this and that and  the other.  You watch each  other's kids.  You come back  with an apple from  their house and  that's it.  They're murderers.  They're looking  through that.  I see a slash there.  Throw it away.  Throw it away.  Remember when you  found the house  that had like the  king size snicker bars  and you had to tell  your whole gang, 
[01:00:30]  dude, the house  on the corner, man.  Major score.  Yeah, you thought  you'd get a major  score.  Then you get there  and they already  ran out of the big  ones and they give  you the bite size.  You used to get  so bummed out.  You're broken in  half.  Exactly.  But they'd have a  line all the way  up to the door  because the word  got out.  The one that I  really liked was  there was always  somebody on your  block like some  guy that just lived  in a house by  himself that got  way into things,  you know, way  too much into it.  You'd come up,  there'd be like  haunted house  noises, there'd 
[01:01:00]  be weird lights  flickering and  he'd jump out  onto the porch,  you know, in a  diaper and a  mask and you  know, he's 29,  he doesn't have  a job.  And then he's  like, you know,  you like open  your bag and  he's like remembers,  oh yeah, I gotta  have candy or  something.  He gives you  like lunch meat.  There you go,  kid.  I used to hate  the people that  would give you  just pennies.  Oh, yeah.  Pennies.  Or old people  with ribbon candy,  they'd like hand  you the dish and  it would be, you  know, it was like  a year old and 
[01:01:30]  you'd have to like  do the whole, it  would be a clump.  Constantino wire.  That's like, it  is, that is like  razor wire.  No, I know, you  could like spread  that across prison  walls.  How about doing  that, man?  Ribbon candy.  And then you'd  have to go out and  your mother would  give you the little  orange box.  You're gonna trick  or treat for  UNICEF this year.  Can't it just be  for me today that I  go out and get  candy for me?  Do I have to save  the world?  I never handed  that money in.  What about me? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, you were one  of those.  Of course.  You go around  with the UNICEF  little orange milk  carton.  Oh, boy, like  they're gonna miss  the 79 cents I  collected.  A whole village  starves because you  don't get 75 cents.  I guarantee you  take that money  like the first time  you do it and you  go out to like a  store and you buy a  yo-yo, like as the  cash register, you  hear screams, you  know, in your little  head, you hear  screams of starving  people.  Here's little Maria.  That yo-yo could  feed my family for a  month. 
[01:02:30]  Come on.  Little Maria's  village is starving  now because Opie's  eating a yo-yo.  Trick or treating  is going to be so  much fun.  What happened to  baked goods?  They don't do  baked goods anymore.  Hate that anyway.  Who wants baked  goods?  I'm just bringing  up stuff that I  remember.  You never get to  keep it.  You know what?  The one thing that  you learn, I was  watching this movie  and there was like  a prostitute and  she'd been like  working for about a  week and she hadn't  seen her John or  anything and she's  in a taxi cab and 
[01:03:00]  she starts stashing  part of the money,  you know, for when,  you know, and he's  like, no, man, I'm  giving you it all,  right?  That's me at  Halloween when I was  a kid, you know,  because like, you  know, you're gonna have  you one piece a day.  Yes.  So, you know, I had  huge pockets.  I stuffed it in my  underwear, blah, blah,  like half my take  would be in my pants  and I'd give the  rest to her.  You holding out on  me?  This don't look like  an auto can do.  You know what we do  around here.  I will pimp slap 
[01:03:30]  your bitch ass.  You don't hand over  the stickers.  I don't care if  you're sick.  I'm gonna spread you  across that wall.  We used to have to  dump it out on the  living room floor and  then my dad would go  through it right in  front of us and he'd  be like, oh, this  looks a little ripped  here.  I better take that  one.  And then later on you  see him munching on  all the good stuff.  Or if they're really  mean, they'll rip it  in front.  Oh, look at that!  It's like getting  stopped in the  country by like a cop  who goes, bam!  Whoa, look at that  headlight!  So then you're just  stuck with some candy 
[01:04:00]  corn and something  stupid.  Always at the bottom  of the bag, the candy  corn.  There you go.  What was your least  favorite candy?  Candy corn.  Candy corn.  I don't like that.  I also don't like  those big puffy orange  peanut things.  Those marshmallowy  Oh, yeah.  It's just that mealy  ugh.  It just makes you  nauseous if you  finish one.  Yes.  Ugh.  What's yours, Mark?  I always hated  junior mints, but  it could have been  because of this  really horrible accident  involving them when  I was younger. 
[01:04:30]  All right, we can  end with this.  No, I can't.  It's not for public  consumption.  This is our junior  mint accident.  All right, I guess  we're not going to  end with that.  I lost my entire  mother's side of the  family.  I didn't like those  other little things  too.  The chocolate babies.  Remember those  things?  The chocolate babies.  They don't have  those anymore.  No, they sure don't.  They had a nickname  that wasn't too  happy to tell you  the truth.  But I never really  liked the taste of  them.  Oh, my God.  Well, it's  chocolate babies.  Remember?  Now I know what  you're talking about. 
[01:05:00]  It was.  And that's what  they were called.  We better get the  hell off the radio.  All right, Mark.  Well, thanks for  stopping by.  Oh, my pleasure.  If you want to know  what Mark looks like,  they have a cute little  picture of him in  this little magazine.  Are you?  You got your  picture in this?  I'm actually on the  cover of the  November issue.  You're a hot babe.  Look at you.  I look a lot more  delicate when I'm  naked.  You remind me of  Sam Kinison,  actually.  Anyone else say  that?  Especially when  you're wearing the  glasses.  All right.  Well, Mark  Golan from Maxim,  it's always a  pleasure. 
[01:05:30]  He's our pal now.  You know, if you're  walking by one of  the newsstands,  please pick up  the latest issue  of Maxim.  We barely discussed  it, but trust me,  you'll like it.  You'll enjoy it.  I need new clothes.  All right, man.  Matt Devote is up  next.  We'll do this all  again tomorrow at  three.  Thanks for listening. </pre>
