<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in their signature sarcastic and irreverent banter.  This segued into a "banana phone" song dedication for a listener, Jesse, whose wife, Susan, had requested it for his birthday (later revealed to be their anniversary).  The hosts' rushed mornings and lack of preparation were discussed.  A news story about a Midtown explosion, caused by a homemade explosive disguised as a novelty grenade, prompted satire of local news reporter John Montone and a segment mocking novelty items, with listeners encouraged to submit their unwanted ones.  The hosts expressed their strong dislike of Spencer Gifts. Anthonyâ€™s commute woes due to the explosion were further discussed, alongside sexually suggestive humor directed at Jesse and Susan.  A plea for listeners to stop sending unfunny email forwards followed, along with a discussion of potential online submission platforms for show content. Opie recounted a story about avoiding a possibly threatening interaction with a Black man, leading to a discussion on NYC street smarts.  Listener calls featured a "Redneck Panic Button" and a story about using a "Wow" sticker to avoid a speeding ticket.  The conversation then veered towards genitalia-shaped novelty items, including a farting finger pen, and discussions about objects used for female masturbation, referencing a past show segment on the topic. The lack of crowds outside the Today Show was noted, along with reminiscences of a past stunt involving a woman flashing with a Wow sticker.  Criticism of Howard Stern for claiming credit for other people's work was also included.  Further listener calls involved a chocolate candy shaped like genitalia, a vibrator disguised as a Harry Potter broom, and a bizarre radio alert from Kentucky featuring a Rosie O'Donnell impersonation. An Arnold Schwarzenegger prank call was played, and the difficulties of improvising soundboard bits were discussed.

The show then focused on prank calls and their legal ramifications.  The hosts recounted past successes ("butt plug" and "Bill's dead" calls), detailing the evolving legal landscape making unsanctioned prank calls illegal.  "Professor Anthony" (Anthony Cumia) provided a sarcastic legal explanation.  Various prank calls were referenced, including the "Bill" calls (featuring increasingly absurd scenarios) and a call to an Alzheimer's support group. Listener calls included a story about a Puerto Rican prostitute and role-playing, and the revelation that Howard Stern used an Opie and Anthony intern's prank call bit.  Significant time was dedicated to promoting Opie and Anthony branded t-shirts designed by Opie's brother.  Brief discussions of the Paul Abdul American Idol controversy and the Pat O'Brien sex tape scandal, including a listener-created remix, were also included.  Comedian Brian Regan was announced as a later guest, scheduled to share a story about a deceased friend from an overdose.


A segment reminiscing about childhood fireworks and homemade explosives using M80s and pipes transitioned into a discussion of a homemade bomb found outside the British consulate. More prank calls, including "Detective John Kimball" calls, were played.  There was a lengthy discussion about Hooters waitresses' uniforms, followed by a sound effect of Opie defecating and a "F.U. Life" segment.  Further discussion of Brian Regan's upcoming appearance was interspersed with commentary on reality TV. A call from Bruce Kelly in England about Cream reunion concerts was interrupted by dropped connection issues.  A significant portion detailed a past tense phone call with Tommy Lee, where the conversation about Pam Anderson led to him hanging up. The Pat O'Brien sex scandal was revisited, with unedited recordings of his explicit phone calls played, eliciting reactions from Brian Regan and the hosts. A sexually explicit prank call by an intern, Nathaniel, was also played.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Tommy Lee and Pat O'Brien and final thoughts, with Brian Regan as a guest in studio for the final part of this segment.


The final segment heavily featured leaked audio recordings of Pat O'Brien's sexually explicit phone calls.  Brian Regan, present in the studio, joined the hosts in dissecting the calls, focusing on their graphic nature and O'Brien's language.  Crude and offensive language was frequently used.  The analysis included O'Brien's apparent cocaine and alcohol use and the bizarre context of the calls.  His subsequent Dr. Phil appearance and an apologetic letter from coworkers were discussed.  Tangents included O'Brien's Hustler magazine interview, the 80s cocaine scene, and Brian Regan's upcoming shows.  Audio clips from the leaked calls and O'Brien's Dr. Phil interview were played. The segment ended with playful banter and further discussion of the leaked audio and upcoming shows.

[00:33:30]  In some way  Shape or form  And it lasted  Somehow  Through the invention  Of television  It still prospered  The internet  Everything else  Everything else  It still  But  But  No one was doing  Anything in radio  All of the radio  Rips me off  People were doing  Nothing when I  Got into it  Is there  Anyone  On this planet  Buying into  This line of shit  Anymore  Anybody

[00:35:00]  What a load  Of shit it is  All of the radio  Rips me off  People were doing  Nothing  When I got into it  That's terrific  That's terrific  Unbelievable  Thank God for you  Because just  How did radio survive  For you know  A hundred years  For eighty years  Before you  Kevin from Brooklyn  What's up  What's up  Owen A  How are you buddy  Going on  Hey Howard  Was doing that  Whole period bit 
[00:35:30]  That you guys  Did the other day  Of course he was  What the trainables  The whole  With the  Yeah exactly  With the sister  Teaching the retarded  Girl about the past  But everyone's  Ripping him off  I mean everyone  Knows we did that  Like I don't know  Two three weeks ago  He's the worst  He was also doing  The whole rosy bit  Also  That's something  That's in the news  Things like that  And finding the  Trainable video  You know  We'd be stupid  To say hey  They're ripping us off  But that's  The type of stuff  Howard does  I was doing that  Nobody was doing 
[00:36:00]  Radio  Robin  They tried before me  But I invented  The microphone  They just looked stupid  Because it never went  Out over the air  Nothing  No one did anything  Before me  Oh that's hilarious  Let's  And that  Nuzzling ass staff  Paul  Hey Paul from  Long Island  What's up  Yeah  If you ever buy  Best Buy  Like on Jericho  Turnpike  And Pomek  They sell  Like these  Little fucking  Dogs  Like in the  Vending machines 
[00:36:30]  And like  I bought a couple  For my kids  And the fucking  Things have like  Balls and cocks  Like to show you  With his leg up  Oh really  Like chocolate dogs  That have genitalia  No like little  Rubber dogs  Like for like  Little kids to collect  And like they have  Fucking genitalia  It's like ridiculous  What's wrong with that  Well we got the story  About the chocolates  That were delivered to us  At WNEW  And they were shaped  Like various sexual organs  So we wanted some chocolate  So I grab a tit  Opie grabs a tit  And we're nibbling  On our tit 
[00:37:00]  We're gnawing  Just gnawing  On your chocolate  Not even really  We're just enjoying  The chocolate  The chocolate was very good  Right  So then Rick comes in  Our old producer Rick  Comes in  Holding this massive  And not even as a joke  Holding this massive  Veined chocolate cock  And just biting into it  Like as we were enjoying  The tit as just chocolate  He was enjoying  This giant chocolate  Veiny cock  As just chocolate  But in all fairness  To Rick  You know  He just picked up  A piece too  He just picked up 
[00:37:30]  But  But  Wasn't really thinking  What piece he was gnawing  On anymore  But you have to think  What piece not to nibble on  Like I knew  Not to pick up the cock  And start eating  The chocolate cock  I'm standing up  So I can itch my ball  Sorry  Nothing better than  The between thumb  And four finger roll  On the side of your bag  It could make you go  Oh  Dude that felt really good  Yeah  But anyway  Yeah  And then he walks into the studio  Because he had to ask us something  Just not realizing  What he was doing  Well we just start  Busting out laughing 
[00:38:00]  It was a big  Veiny chocolate dick  That he just has  In his hand  And he's  Nibbling on the head  Everybody knows  You don't bite that  You just suck it  Until it melts in your mouth  Who doesn't know that?  By the way  I want to say hi to Howard  He listens every morning  After his show  In his Escalade  That is equipped with  XM Satellite Radio  We know for a fact  Hello Howie  Randy from Florida 
[00:38:30]  What's up?  Hey guys  Yeah  A few years ago  They had a  Plastic candy dispenser  That was shaped like a cock  And it was marketed to children  And it actually  You would suck the candy  It was a juice candy  You would suck out of the top of it  And it was on the news  Where people just  They're just fucking  Losing their minds about it  Huh  A cock  There's a candy out  That they're  Marketing to kids  And a bunch of critics  Are saying it ought to be pulled  It's a lollipop  Yeah 
[00:39:00]  Shut up  It's a whole new story  You fucking ass  I'm done with you  You inspired me  To tell a new story  Jesus  Fuck  What an asshole  Calm down Anthony  I know  I love our listeners  I don't like your car  He's just very ambitious  He wants to help out the program  Stop  All right  Thanks  Thanks Randy  Hey no problem guys  I'm teasing of course  I love jumping down people's throats  When they're stupid  It's a lollipop  Yeah  It was a lollipop  You're a lollipop  You're a lollipop 
[00:39:30]  You're a lollipop  You're on edge today sir  I drove through a bombing OP  It's flavored like marijuana  And critics of the product  Say it's one more way  To make illegal drugs seem cool  Mmhmm  I recall as a child  Being able to buy candy cigarettes  Remember those things?  Of course  When you were a kid  And they had little  They looked like the real cigarette packs  Yeah  And they were  A little like chalk  And they had a little dab 
[00:40:00]  Of that red dye number five  Give you ass cancer  And you kind of  Made like you were smoking  Wouldn't they puff too?  Something would puff  Yeah  You get a little puff of something  Oh there were a couple  Of the like fake cigarettes  I don't think it was the candy ones  That you kind of blew out of  And some powder came out  And made it look like you were smoking  Isn't that great?  Marketing smoking to kids back then  They said  I was watching something on  Oh it was in that stupid documentary  The McDonald's documentary  They were saying that they do that  Because a kid will remember that  Years later  And remember that fine candy thing 
[00:40:30]  And then subconsciously  Pick up cigarettes  Really?  That was one of the  Psychological things  I just thought it was kind of cool  Like you know  If you bought  One of those little plastic tool kits  As a kid  It's like  Oh look  I'm like daddy  I got my tool kit  Or doctor kit  Or something like that  It's the same thing  You use cigarettes  Because you want to  Kind of do what your parents  And what you see adults doing  As a kid  So you  Get the cigarette  Have your fake little cigarette  And then you eat it  I don't think that makes you smoke  When you get older  No no I'm saying  That was the argument  I'm not saying it made it  That was the argument  Yeah I know  Well that's why they pulled 
[00:41:00]  Those things off the market  You know  But I don't think that  I don't think that  Inspired anybody to start smoking  How about the little black eye patch  You'd buy for your female friend  Just to kind of be like your parents  You know  Get the cigarette tools  Little fat lip  You can give to your girlfriend  Here put this on  Let me belt you in the face  Hey guys  Let's say hi to Susan  Susan  Hi  Hi  You were the one  That called for Jesse  To hear the banana phone  Or something like that  Yes that was me  And it's your anniversary today

[00:45:00]  Disguised as a Harry Potter broom  Um  One of the comments  This toy was number one on my daughter's Christmas list  So what the heck  Although it was no educational value  I figured it would be good for imaginative play  It wasn't until  After she opened her gift  And started playing  That I realized  The toy may offer more than  A sensational experience  The broomstick has cute sound effects  And vibrates  When they put it between their legs  To fly  Come on  What were the creators of this toy thinking  She'll keep playing with the Nimbus 2000 
[00:45:30]  But with the batteries removed  Oh cause you're doing some of that  Good parenting  Thank you  Here's another one  I recently bought this for my son  He's a huge Harry Potter fan  Seen the movie 32 times  And made the paper  I guess he made the newspaper for seeing it so many times  This toy gives him  That's as bad as making the paper for playing asteroids  It's certainly not  At least that was my accomplishment  Of course it was  For Pete's sake  This toy gives him the ability to fly around the house  Zapping things  My only problem I see with the toy 
[00:46:00]  Is the batteries drain too fast  And his sister fights him over it  So now I need to buy her one  She has no idea what's going on  The batteries drain too fast  And the sister's fighting for it  Anthony I gotta break into your reading  For a wacky radio alert from Tom in Kentucky  Oh let me ask  Yes Tom  I got Lex and Terry going on right now  And they're using Rosie's voice from that movie  Yeah  And calling 900 numbers  And letting Rosie talk to the operator  Oh that's wacky

[00:50:00]  Vibrating Harry Potter broom  Here's another letter from a parent  When my 12 year old daughter asked for this for her birthday  I kind of wondered if she was too old for it  But she seems to love it  Her friends love it too  They play for hours in her bedroom with this great toy  They really seem to like the special effects it offers  The sound effects and vibrating  My oldest daughter 17 really likes it too  I recommend this for all children  A 17 year old girl  Riding around on this Harry Potter broom 
[00:50:30]  By the way  The pictures of the broom are now up on foundrymusic.com  We're updating this site on the fly all the time  So you guys could play along at home  And you got the original picture of the kid Anthony on the broom  Yep  Then you got a picture of just a broom  So maybe you can photoshop the hell out of it  Have fun  And then they got the Harry Potter vibrating broom  With a naked girl riding it  Look at this  Oh wow  So that's pretty hot  Jesus  It's on foundrymusic.com  And I think it's on opiananthony.com too  Look at this  Can I read this letter too  This is a really silly one 
[00:51:00]  Yeah  As a parent it was really tough  Because all five of my kids would argue over the broom  So I decided  Oh my god  I decided they all needed a bath  Oh my god  Andrea from Houston  Oh my god  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  I plugged it in and threw it in the tub  Waka waka  My 12 year old daughter is a big Harry Potter fan  I loved the part with the Nimbus 2000 
[00:51:30]  So I decided to buy her this toy  I was afraid she would think it was too babyish  But she loves it  Even my daughter's friends enjoy playing with this fun toy  I was so surprised at how long they could just sit in her room  And play with this magic broomstick  A great buy for any Harry Potter fan  These freaking parents have no idea what's going on  Yep  God  Knowing what this thing does  And then to read these letters  That's great  I was surprised at how long they could just sit in her room  And play with the magic stick  There are stories of girls that would masturbate with their Barbie dolls 
[00:52:00]  Oh yeah  You know they would just take the legs and  It could be a hot side bit today  We get some of these ladies from around the country  To tell us what they used to masturbate with  I know as a young boy growing up  You were always looking for some fun exciting thing  To jack with  You know  I was trying to figure out a new way  Did you ever like  Anything that was  Besides your hand  Hollered out banana peel once  Hollered out banana peel  I'll take it in warm water  I read about it in a magazine  Try that

Well you have to make sure the socks are very soft or you're in deep trouble  And you gotta be careful  I took a pillow once  And it had a hole in it  The pillow  And I put cellophane in there 
[00:53:00]  Kind of drove it in there  And threw some Vaseline in there  And I fucked the pillow  Jesus  I guess I was like  I don't know  Fourteen or so  Just like a monkey  You know  Trying to screw anything  It was great because like  You didn't have to use your hand  So you're kind of laying on the pillow  The pillow is being held in place with your lower abdomen  And the cellophane is being held in place against your body and the bed or anything 
[00:53:30]  And you could just pound away on the pillow  So what do you do with your hands besides hold them over your face so you don't catch yourself in the mirror?  You choke yourself  That's classic  Hey really fast  We're all over the place  That's great  Thumb through pictures of mom  Really fast guys  It's a quickie  But everyone has seen the video of Kelsey Grammer falling as he's doing a serious play or whatever

[00:55:30]  Oh dear lord  To play over that Rage Against the Machine music at the beginning of the show  Compass ass just takes a tumble  We have to update our instant replays  We got some old sound clips on here  I need this one  This new one  Pretending I was a UN interpreter  Oh good lord  Did he continue with the play? 
[00:56:00]  It was some kind of  It wasn't even a play  I think it was just  Giving a speech  You know how celebrities get paid huge amounts of money  To stand on a stage in front of people and talk  For some reason  So he was just  Very pompous  Strutting across the stage  Just kind of  Telling some boring story about him playing a UN interpreter  And oops  Pretending I was a UN interpreter  Oh good lord 
[00:56:30]  Dope  I love that new clip  Good find  I hit my life call button  I owe my life to it  Who was that?  Danny?  With the pickup?  On the Kelsey Grammer?  Great job  Speaking of Price is Right  We'll get through this real fast  And we'll take a break  Bob Barker has skin cancer  Oh he does  Got a couple clips about that  You see how tan that son of a bitch is all the time?  He's ancient and he's tan  So you know he's been in the sun his whole life 
[00:57:00]  Gotta watch that sunshine  Bob Barker is paying the price for living a lifetime in the sun  And he's talking only to extra about his skin cancer  Only to extra of course  Because you guys are so important  Why does it matter if he's only talking to extra?  Because we're your celebrity skin cancer connection  Ugh  I can't get enough of those two shows though  Bob Barker he has skin cancer  Ugh  We're hoping he dies for May Sweeps 
[00:57:30]  Skin cancer  I'm gonna have surgery on Friday the 13th  And uh  I didn't choose the date  Oh god  You don't want to hear that  Ugh  Why would you pick Friday the 13th?  Just in case there's something to it  Out of all the days  He didn't pick  The doctors did  Barker admits being careless in his youth 
[00:58:00]  I was in the sun from the time I was a kid  We went to every beach in the world practically  And we were by our own pool all the time  And now Bob regrets it all  It catches up with you  Doctors have found a potentially life-threatening skin cancer on his ear and back  A lesion on my back is a pre-melanoma  And they're very serious  And they want to be careful and get that out  Pat O'Brien returns tonight 
[00:58:30]  Is that the deal?  Ooh  Really?  On the Insider?  Back on the Insider  Well we got the Pat O'Brien Dr. Phil special  We could run through that  I didn't get to hear that because I was watching the Paul Abdul thing  Well we could do that too next  Yeah  We'll do both alright  I actually watched a good portion of the Dr. Phil thing  Did you really?  Yeah  Oh we're going to need your help  Because I was just about to watch it and the phone rang 
[00:59:00]  And I got into a long thing  Okay  A thing?  A little long thing about nothing that's important really  But  You're talking to someone about that thing?  It was a thing  Yeah  The thing in Brooklyn?  No the other thing  So I missed the whole Dr. Phil thing  Because we're bats  That was our homework assignment  Everyone knows that  Oh I can be helpful  You can be helpful?  Were you just sickened?  Yes and no  Because I was still taking a peek  And you know what  Pat O'Brien  Well we'll get into it at the break  But he just  He's not listening to Dr. Phil 
[00:59:30]  Of course he's not  He's just like  Let's just get this over with  Shut up  Back to getting some ass  Betsy  He doesn't care  He really doesn't care  Dr. Phil's going to help him  Dr. Phil helps a lot of people  Bub  Bub  Get on Jimmy's bad side  Bub  Oh we got the Arnold calls?  Oh my god  Should we continue?  No let's take a break  We'll do the Arnold calls  Because those guys just reminded us of  You know  Soundboard prank calls that work  You can't really do them on the fly really 
[01:00:00]  That's the type of thing you do after the show  You call a million numbers  And maybe you get two or three good ones  And then you play those on your show  And make believe you're doing it on the fly  That's  Oh  I shouldn't tell people that  What?  And by the way  They were doing illegal radio  So maybe we should report them to the FCC  You're not allowed to do prank calls anymore  That's the only reason we don't do them anymore  Yeah they're fun to do  Everyone loves a good prank call  Because we can't get in trouble anymore  It's a stalking law right?  Are the prank calls? 
[01:00:30]  You have to tell them they're on the air  It's a recording law  It's a law like  You know  The FBI has to adhere to  Unless they get a court order  The FCC took that away from radio years ago  Even prank calls that you play later  All those phone scams  And stuff that these radio stations do  It's all illegal shit now  There was a loophole  For a little while  That you got away with  That if you told the person  After the fact  Like  You record their call  You do the prank  And then when it's all done  You tell them  Hey look  We'd like to play this on the air 
[01:01:00]  Do we have your permission?  And then you get that on tape  And you can do it  But then they said  You can't even record somebody  Without asking their permission first  So the act of even recording them  Whether it airs or not  You're not even allowed to record somebody  Without asking them  If you can record it  Then there was another law  That said  As long as there was a third party  On the line  That gave their permission  Then you can do it  So if you had the  Let's say  A woman's mother on the phone 
[01:01:30]  But also had the woman on the phone  And she was listening in  Then you could record the whole thing  But they got away with that  Forget Aristotle  And fuck Socrates  Here comes Professor Anthony  This was stuff we needed to know  This was stuff in the  Didn't you get the memos?  Yeah but I forgot all that  Ugh  And now you just can't record it  Don't you make room in that brain  For new things?  No  Why would you still remember that?  Anthony and I had to read FCC transcripts  That was one of the things we had to do  On a daily basis at the old place 
[01:02:00]  Yep  On a daily basis  All the laws  And then when they took the prank calls  Away from us  And Anthony and I  We were really good at it  I mean not to pat ourselves on the back  But we did a pretty good job  Who can forget butt plugs?  Come on  Well we can play one as we go to break  Simple call  All you do is say butt plug  How about hi mom I'm gay  I mean there's a million of them  Please  How about old Bill  How about scrotum?  Please  You want to play old Bill?  Which one do you like Ben?  Oh they're all good  Which prank call do you want us to play?  I'm gonna cross the street 
[01:02:30]  Yeah let's play that one  It's a classic  It's off our cringe CD  That we were never allowed to release  These were women at an Alzheimer's support group  And they're supposed to help out people with Alzheimer's  So we called up as old Bill  And they were trying to really help  When Bill's dead  Where the hell was that call man?  Bill's dead's a good one  Yeah that's another fun one  Where?  You're kidding  How did it happen?  Where? 
[01:03:00]  Oh my god  Someone find this for me  Give my condolences to the children  Eric?  Do you know?  They call my name's Bill  Okay I got it  Hawk help them find that thing  I don't believe it  This is a great call actually  I love this thing  Alright  Who is this?  That's my favorite line I heard  Who is this?  You want me to play that?  You know  You gotta play it for the new listeners  Alright we'll play a double shot here  No a double shot  Thank you 
[01:03:30]  Thank you  Let's see  You know what I do to get big laughs sometimes  When I'm out with my friends  What's that?  You guys can all have this  Uh huh  I take my little clear plastic yogurt lid  Yeah  And I fold it in half  And I move it like it's a little mouth  When I talk it talks  And then you can make it say things  And maybe carry on a conversation with it  Yeah  Give me a little  Oh how are you today?  Oh tired  Look he's tired  The lid  By the way  That's classic  It's too early for me to eat yogurt  Yeah  That was Jimmy scraping  Because I'm getting some complaints 
[01:04:00]  I didn't hear any scraping  Oh my god  They heard  They heard  My brother's like  What the hell are you guys doing?  You guys eat the entire morning  He can't believe it  He's expecting to hear like microwaves going off  And scanners  He goes  You might as well just broadcast from a 7-Eleven  Eating up burritos  Because we all have different eating schedules  You know  Uh huh  Anthony's eating now  I usually eat in the back office  And then I start snacking  Starting around 8.30  9 o'clock  He goes  You guys aren't using that much energy  That you should be eating that much 
[01:04:30]  On a daily basis  By 8 I'm pretty much done  But we were yapping a lot  Yeah so you got to catch up  I want to catch a chance to eat  I eat during the first break  There you go  You bet he does  Oh look his yogurt lid's talking  That is hysterical  You've got to take that on stage  Anthony  Getting back to the prank call thing  Remember the old place  So we were having a lot of fun  With the prank calls  Right  And all of a sudden  They took that away from us  But they're like  You guys could still do them  Just tell them  You're on  You know  That you're taping for a radio show  Yeah  I'm like 
[01:05:00]  Are you guys that stupid  How is a prank call supposed to work  If you get the person on the air  And go  Okay  Look  We're going to tape you for the radio  So pretend that you're  A really nervous  Concerned mom  Yeah  Alright  That's going to be your job  Make believe we didn't have this conversation  But by the way  Do I have permission to tape you  Yeah  Yes  Okay  Okay now forget about that  I just asked your permission  And that we're a radio show  Because now I'm going to try to fool you  Right  We actually had this conversation  With bosses  And that's why  Once again  We just don't listen to them  They're just a bunch of dopes  That's why also 
[01:05:30]  Most of the prank calls you hear  Are fake  They're set up  They're  They're  Acted  It's people that are  Being paid  And they call them up  And do the prank call  Funny  Alright here we go  You want to hear the  The Bill's Dead  I love Bill's Dead  Alright here's Bill's Dead  That's set up basically  A lady called the radio station  Yeah we used to get a lot of these too  Where people dialed the wrong number  And for some reason  They would get  Our studio line  So whenever we heard somebody 
[01:06:00]  That didn't quite fit  The  The demographic  When we were at AF  It was a rock station  You know  And so you'd get  Hey dude  Did you play some corn?  Like yeah okay  So when you got like kids calling up  Every kid sounded like Beavis or Butthead  Yeah  Every single one  Uh  Could you play that like  Soundgarden  Tune  Yeah yeah  Play it  They rock  That was every call we got  Every single one  So when you got like  Hello  You knew it was like 
[01:06:30]  Yes  You didn't say like AF  Right  It was  Hello  Hello  Hi I'm here to talk to the physician  Okay well  Hold on  We'll get him  You know  Who are we to disappoint?  I'm gonna put you on  With Dr. Anthony  So this woman called  And we knew  She obviously wasn't calling  To request the song  And uh  We fucked with her a little bit  Hello  Hi  Hi  Bill  Who's this?

[01:09:00]  And drugs  Fuck  And eat  Go crazy  Bye  Bye  That's still  I don't believe it  Alright well  There you have it  I like that wacky radio alert  I think there's something there  Definitely  Because we were trying to figure out that bit  We know there was some potential  But I think the listeners have to take that one and run with it  When they're hearing something really just awful locally  They got to call on the show  Let us in on it  Because when we just go to the phones over and over again 
[01:09:30]  Remember like last week we tried and just never went anywhere  Yeah  You can't spend too much time on it  Alright  Quick hits  Quick hits  We live and learn here  Alright  Anthony so we'll play  They call my name's Bill  We will  When  The new guys when  The new guys here at XM Saturday Radio  They don't get it  But whenever any of us need coffee  We just go  Bill needs coffee  But Bill hates coffee  I know  Bill hates coffee 
[01:10:00]  I'm gonna cry  I do that too  Like if me and my chick are outside  And I want to run across to Starbucks or whatever  Yeah  I go  I'm gonna cross the street now  Every time I go across the street  Anthony did a whole series of these calls  And unfortunately we lost most of them  We had Bill  You know  Stuck in a trunk once  Calling a locksmith  Bill trying to buy one of those little rascal scooters  Yeah  And then one of my favorites  But we just have a horrendous copy of it 
[01:10:30]  Is Bill taking too much Viagra  When Viagra just first hit the market  He got a big hard-on that wouldn't go away  And he didn't know what to do with it  And he called the doctor  I forgot  That one is great  But I just have the worst  Worst copy of that one  It won't go away  And it's turning purple  Remember all that?  You better get to a hospital  But we're  The old trunk gag  Yeah  Like no one's gonna buy this  But I forgot who we called  A locksmith or somebody  Yeah  I was thinking maybe 9-1-1  I'm stuck in a trunk 
[01:11:00]  And that one worked too  Hello  Alright here's Bill  Bill  They call my name's Bill  He's a little lost  And he's calling the Alzheimer's Association  And these poor old ladies  They're just volunteering their time  You know what the thing is  Do-gooders  Right  The thing about these ladies also  Every day  The calls they get are just  These inane nothing calls  This  They have a chance to really help  And they all get involved  They all really want to help 
[01:11:30]  This is like the most exciting thing  That has ever happened to these ladies  And you can tell  There's a little bickering  Going on between them  One thinks she knows better  How to handle the situation  And they completely just  Fall apart in an emergency  Yeah there's a whole dynamic going on  There's blame going on  When certain things happen  Oh yeah  I pick up something new  Every time I hear this call  Yeah  Listen to the ladies  More so than Bill  One of my favorite lines is  See I told you  Oh that's the blame  See I told you  Listen to that  It's in the background  But it's hilarious  See I told you 
[01:12:00]  I told you  So we'll go to break with this  Oh the Ronald Reagan library call  Oh my  Yeah there's a lot  Maybe we  I don't know  Maybe we can  We'll feature a few of them  As the show goes on today  Yeah Anthony actually called  The Ronald Reagan library  As Ronald Reagan  And they bought it  They bought it for a little while  Yeah for a little while  They actually  A couple of the people  Thought it was Reagan calling  Yeah  Alright anyway  We'll play this as we go to break  When we come back  We'll do the Paul Abdul thing  That Anthony saw  And the Dr. Phil  Pat O'Brien thing  That Jimmy saw

[01:20:00]  No  I mean I  I remember that fun  I'm just  No  Well  Man  I had to go back  To Long Island  Years ago  All I wanted  All I wanted  From my old house  Was my computer  And some  I don't know  Other electronic  Equipment video stuff  That's it  I didn't want furniture  I didn't want  I'm starting a new life  And the doors were locked  And she wasn't home 
[01:20:30]  And I didn't  Know what the hell  Was going to happen  So I broke in  Yeah  Broke the window  In the back  You were a big radio star  At this point  And you're breaking  Into your own house  Just because you want  Your stupid computer  Under the cover of darkness  I'm out by the back patio  And there's a back door  With glass panes in it  That are about  I don't know  Eight by ten  Yeah  Eight by ten glass panes  So bam  I put my elbow  Through one of them  And I actually  Crawled through it  Yeah  A little  Trying to get my  Shoulders through there 
[01:21:00]  Crawled through  Opened the door  Swept up the glass  Nicely  Left a little note  Said could be glass shards  Watch out for the cats  Don't let  You know I patched up the hole  He is the nicest guy  And then I ransacked the place  I would have taken an axe  Like good old Jack  You know something  And got in that way  I would have  But I didn't want the cats  Getting out  Because you know  I kind of liked the cats  But I didn't want the cats  Getting out  So then I just took my stuff  My computer equipment  And stuff  And left  That was it 
[01:21:30]  You actually got to use a key  Yeah  Yeah  Key was left for me  That's real sweet  Thanks  A little nice of you  Jesus  What did you get?

[01:22:00]  One more load  And then I'm done  And then you're done?  Yeah  You're leaving a lot of stuff?  It's just hilarious  To see all your crap  Just askew in the back  Of your Grand Cherokee  This is ridiculous  F-ing ridiculous  Ridiculous  I mean I moved on  About two years ago  But it was convenient  Just to keep my stuff there  Storage facility  That's what it turned out to be  A storage facility  For furniture  Clothing  People that aren't  In your lives anymore  It was just 
[01:22:30]  A storage facility  Right  Yeah  Now it's  You know  Time to get it all  Out of there  Yes  You gonna get rid  Of the apartment out there  Or no?  Is it gonna actually  Just go?  Oh it's not my apartment  Jimmy  You silly goose  It doesn't say  Who's gonna stay there  And who isn't  But you know what  Cause a lot of people  A lot of the hardcore listeners  Know where I used to live  Because you bastards  Used to beep every time  You drove by my house  You might wanna be there  Sunday  Might be some good memorabilia 
[01:23:00]  On the front lawn  Oh really?  Yeah  The garbage day  When you're gonna bring  Everything out?

[01:29:30]  It really bombed  It takes a long time  I've been listening  Since the first days  In New York  And I love you guys  Alright  I'm punching out  Thanks Andy  Yeah  Nice try Fatso  That was awful  He didn't even say  Like  Like the whole plot line  Of his gag was bad  And then the way  He said it was  Hi Bobby  I said  I have my boss  And she's  Huh  Ron what's wrong  What  You're on the radio  Let's go  Oh hey guys  What's up with that guy 
[01:30:00]  He sounded like  He was running on a treadmill  He's a guy  He was just  He was trying to  He was trying to be funny  And it bombed  And he's like  I was just trying to make a point  No you weren't  You fat fuck  You were trying to be  Humorous  And you struck out  What a typical  Freaking A  I want to be in New York  Hey  You know what I mean  Oh my god  Alright Ron  I would say  I'm waiting for the car  Come on  Hey Steve  Steve and Billy  I think it was  Yesterday morning  They  That guy Sandy Kenyon  Was on  Doing the  Entertainment report  Yeah  And he said  Something about  Melania Gennaro  And he comes on

[01:31:00]  The listeners involvement  You guys are down to a C minus  You guys are really  Really slowing everything down  You're really holding us back  Your calls stink  The content  The delivery  The pacing  Is horrid  We're doing an A minus show  You guys are giving us  You guys are doing a C minus  So you know  You got to average  Unfortunately  There's a fucking  Grading curve here  That means this show's  A B right now  We're carrying our weight  People  We go to the phones  And you're bringing  Our average down 
[01:31:30]  Alright everyone's  Coming up with ideas  For products  The O&A  Cum cleaners  eBay t-shirt  The Bob Ross t-shirt  On ebay  That we all sign  Is up to five hundred dollars  Five hundred bucks  Don't need to take that call  Product  Bobblehead dolls  No thank you  Another product  O&A toilet paper cozy  And another product  That we should market  Little Jimmy tampons  Thank you  We don't need cum cleaners  We have them  They're called interns  Alright let's get  Big duties Jay 
[01:32:00]  Suggests the O&A laughing hat  Imagine a big dopey hat  With our names on it  You put it on  Before the show  So you can laugh  Two places for beer  On each side  Of course  Straws that come down  From each one  Into your mouth  Fun hat  Should we get into  The Paul Abdul thing  There's two big  Stories out there  The Paul Abdul  And then Pat O'Brien  With Dr. Phil  We'll do both here  Let's get into  Paul Abdul  I did not see  The Dateline special  Get into Paul Abdul  I watched American Idol 
[01:32:30]  Last night  They threw off  The fat guy  Finally  Wasn't he the hack  He was the hack  Right  That had a website  Vote for the worst  Or something like that  Yeah a lot of people  Were saying he was the worst  But  That Anthony kid  Is the worst  He's horrible  I mean  Scott was  Just as bad  I think  But there was just  Just nudged him out  A little bit  Vocally  But this Anthony  Fedorov kid  Has gotta go  He's this milk toast 
[01:33:00]  White  Jack off  Like  Nothing  There's nothing special  About him  And his voice  Is very mediocre  It's just  Eh  He's there  I think he should've gone  But I love how  American Idol's getting  Real cruel  With the contestants  There's five of them left  What they do  Is they separate  Into the  The lowest voted for  And the highest voted for  People  And then  Out of the lowest voted for  Obviously they take  One of them  Who had the lowest  And kick him out  So it was Scott 
[01:33:30]  And Anthony  But  We didn't know that  And at the beginning  Of the show  They go  Okay  And  Anthony  You can sit over  On the couch  Because the couch  Is the safe area  All  All the other weeks  The couch was the safe area  So he goes  You can sit over  On the couch  And he goes  Sits down on the couch  Didn't say you're safe  Just said sit on the couch  Then he goes  Scott  You too  Can sit on the couch  And he looks up  And does that  Thank you God thing  Sits on the couch  Then they tell the other 
[01:34:00]  Three contestants  To stand here on the stage  Now you're thinking  They're the lowest voted  And one of them  Is going to be kicked off  And then he turns around  And goes  You two on the couch  Were the lowest voted  Last week  So now they're sitting there  Thinking they were safe  Pulled the rug out  From under him  That's a little wacky  It's cruel  Is what it is  That's a little  Reality show turnaround  A little twist  They like to do  A little twist  And then they threw  Fatty off  Which hopefully  Anthony will go next week  I think the three  That are left  The blonde chick 
[01:34:30]  I said  The black chick  And the rocker dude  I only watched  The first two episodes  And they showed  That blonde chick  From the farm  That was very innocent  I'm like  She's winning  Done  Done  She's still on  Yeah I said that  From the beginning  She's still on  She's one of the  The last four  Or something right  The last three  There's three left  Oh wow  There's the  Oh four left  Sorry  There's the stupid  Because I'm thinking  Anthony's got to get  Thrown off  So I'm just looking at three  And any one of those  Three can win  The blonde chick  The rocker dude  And the black chick  And I think the blonde chick 
[01:35:00]  Though is going to get  Kicked off  It could be between  Bo and Vonzel  If I remember  Your name right  No one is Vonzel  No offense Anthony  But you might as well  Be speaking French  A lot of people  Watch American Idol  I know  I don't really know  These people  I know the blonde chick  Was kind of hot  The blonde chick though  Is kind of plain  She's kind of plain too  Her voice ain't bad  But there's nothing  Really outstanding about her  The black chick  Is really good  And that Bo guy  He's got a really good voice  Big Bo fan  And well 
[01:35:30]  He seems to have  A lot of fans  He's kind of  Original for this competition  There's no other guys  In the competition  That have really  Come off like this guy  He's very professional  You can tell  He's been in the business  You know  Knocking around  With a local band  For a while  The rock guy  And he's got  A really good voice  And he does blow  Was he the guy  That blew off his band  No that was  Constantine  He got kicked off  Last week  I'm keeping tabs on it  Thank you Anthony  That's your  American Idol update 
[01:36:00]  So the Paul Abdul thing  Yeah  This was a guy  From a couple of years back  That was in the competition  Got thrown out  Because he didn't disclose  Some criminal charges  That were against him  I don't know  How good his chances were  I heard him singing last night  Didn't sound that good  But the big story is  That right from the start  Paula Abdul  Became personally  Interested in this guy  Slipped him  Her phone number  Through a third party  He called her up 
[01:36:30]  And she started talking  About how she's going  To coach him through this  Not give him  Any preferential treatment  Because by that point  The American public  Are the one that votes  It's not up to the judges anymore  But sometimes  The judges' comments  Could kind of sway  The people's vote  So they're thinking  She really talked this guy up  She would give him  The clothes to wear  Took him out  To have his hair done  They were out in public  They went out one night  With friends of his  Back to her house 
[01:37:00]  He spent the night there  A few nights  And this guy's saying  They had sex  Also  Kind of scandalous  If you think about it  But it's  You know  It's Paula Abdul  What's the guy supposed to do  Say no?  Right  You know  You gotta have that  In your resume  If you're this guy  Absolutely  I gotta go  I gotta go  The phone Anthony  Stephanie in Jersey  Stephanie  Hey  What's up?  I just wanted to let you guys know  That your Pat O'Brien  Little ditty  With the Let's Go Crazy  By Prince

[01:38:00]  Which one is that?  This is really funny  Check this out  Are you kidding me?  I did it all  An ONA intern  He's playing it  That's great  That's wonderful  That's good  Howard's playing our intern's material  Yeah the king of all media  Is ripping off our intern  Our glorified intern  Because he's finally getting  A glorified intern  A little paper in his pocket  Hit it  Saved message  Sunday  7  Oh 9  He's playing this  Hey it's me  I know what's wrong with me  And why I'm like this

Don't mind if I do  You have no more messages  There you have it  That's our intern  Derek's masterpiece  Anthony  I invented interns on the radio  So I could use  Any of their material  All of the radio  Rips me off  People were doing nothing  When I got into it  What an asshole  I swear to god  What an ass  This guy has been  Ripping off DJs  For so many years  We were on to this thing  Years ago  But we were made to  Shut up behind the scenes 
[01:40:30]  That's why he  Talks like that  He played the Stevie Wonder  One too  These are all  We played it almost  Every day while you  Guys were away  These were all sent in  By our listeners  We played all of them  Before vacation  Those must just sound  So great on regular radio  With a beep  Every two seconds  Must just sound great  Beep  Beep  I invented beeps 
[01:41:00]  It's just amazing  That he'll  Come up with statements  Like this  And then rip off  Literally  I mean  Ripped off our intern  All of the radio  Rips me off  People were doing nothing  When I got into it  So he says that  And then he plays  Derek's masterpiece  What a hypocrite  What a dick  Keep listening to us  In your  Stretch Escalade limo  You ass  And make believe  You don't  Even the talking yogurt lid  Agrees with me  Robin 
[01:41:30]  That I'm being ripped off  Let's go to the  I call him  G-yogurt liddy  Let's go to the  Talking yogurt lid  Oh Anthony  Talking yogurt lid  That's my new favorite bit  Love that character  Thanks for that update  See him on t-shirts  That was another  Wacky radio alert  By the way Anthony  Yep  Alright so the  Paul Abdul thing  So then they just  Start banging  That's what this 
[01:42:00]  Kid is claiming  Yep  Claims that they had  Some of that  Their what you call  Sex  And Channel 7  Had a  Well ABC  Had a whole report  On it last night  And they brought in  A bunch of  Contestants from that  Season  Sat him down  And talked to him  How did you feel  That this was going on  Some people feel  A little betrayed  And that he had  A better shot  And it wasn't fair  And she should be  Bounced as one  Of the judges  Did they play  The prank phone call  I only saw a couple  Of the Paul Abdul thing 
[01:42:30]  It was a voicemail  Of hers  Yeah because  If the press calls  To just not say anything  Yeah we got that clip  But basically  Paul Abdul had a statement  Basically saying  This guy is a known liar  A liar  Something like that  This isn't true  Blah blah blah  So then the kid's like  Oh really  Well listen to this  Voicemail that you  Left for me  If it's not true  Why would you call  The guy up and say  Hey if any of the  Press calls  Just don't say  Anything to him  Right  Say nothing  And why are there  Phone records  Linking you to him 
[01:43:00]  I know that there's  Phone records  Hours and hours  They showed one of  His phone bills  And it's just  Hours of phone calls  Between these two  And why wouldn't you  I won't dignify that  With a response  Shut up  One of the contestants  Is saying you banged him  And you're going  I won't respond  Of course you respond  That means guilty  Of course it does  She bought him  A cell phone  They both went down  To a cell phone store  Bought him his  A cell phone  This guy had nothing  You know  Didn't barely have  A place to sleep  I think  Stayed with his parents  Bought him a cell phone 
[01:43:30]  Just so she could  Talk to him  And not have  Any kind of record  Of it  And of course  There's plenty of  Records of it  This guy  Just turned around  And really sold her out  Well he was an  Opportunist too  Yeah  Couldn't keep his  Mouth shut  Well here's the  Voicemail that  Paul Abdul  Left this contestant  To replay this message  Press 1  Hey it's Paula  Call me back  Listen if the press  Is trying to talk to you  You say absolutely nothing  Sure  It's all you do  He says it's Paula Abdul  Apparently reacting 
[01:44:00]  To the news leak  People are crazy  I don't know  I don't know  It's regarding them  But something's going on  Okay  I hope you're doing well  A little relationship there  You could tell  I believe the guy  I think he's a scumbag  He should have kept  His mouth shut  His books are  130 something pages  Are you kidding  Yeah  It's like  It's like a  Just a bunch of  Leaflets stapled together  Yeah it's a pamphlet  In large print probably 
[01:44:30]  Yeah probably a lot  About his awful life  And his nerves  Leading up to Idol  It's probably two pages  Of him fucking her  And the rest is nonsense  I fucked her  And when I came  I aimed for the  Men at work DVD  You had sex  With Paula Abdul  Yeah I did  She was a judge  On the show  Yeah she was  Did you see anything  Wrong with that  Of course  That's why we were  Keeping it secret  Duh  Alright  Ass  Yeah you idiot  There's something wrong  With it but 
[01:45:00]  But I'm fucking  Paula Abdul  Yeah  And now  Corey is asked  If this is a  PR stunt I guess  I need to set  The record straight  For myself  And you know  Unfortunately I need  To set the record  Straight for her too  Because she was  A part of it  Is this a publicity  Stunt for you  No this is me  Telling the truth  And it just so happens  To be  A very explosive truth  Still with his  First record  Soon to be released  The connection  Seems obvious  Of course you know 
[01:45:30]  Why he's doing it  Yeah  Cause he's  Recording some  Record  Some album  So was this  Pretty much  Who cares TV  Last night  Yeah  You know  I was expecting  A little more  The way they were  Pumping it up  And the way  Stupid Fox  Trying to fight it  You know  To get it off  Just made it bigger  And then when it aired  It was like  This is really nothing  You know  You expect this big  Thing that she  She actually  Helped him move along 
[01:46:00]  In the competition  And left these  Phone messages  We heard about  I was hoping  It was kind of  You know  Like Pat O'Brien's  Phone messages  But no  It was kind of  A non-thing  I think she'll just  Go along  Being the judge  I don't think Fox  Is going to bounce her  Or anything  And this guy  He's not going to  Sell any more  Albums or books  Because of this  Whole thing either  You want the  Explosive messages  I just want to  Lick your balls  I want you to  Fuck you  Just act like  You're into  Emilio  Get Emilio in there  Speaking of which  Where's the  Get Randy Jackson 
[01:46:30]  Randy can watch  Where's the new  Pat O'Brien thing  Of course you do that  Though when you're  Releasing a CD  Yeah  Anything to pump it up  I'm sure he's got  His peeps that told him  Look  Is there any way  You can get more  Publicity for this thing  Well I  Had sex with  Paul Abdul  There you go  And his new  Stupid CD  Is called  Trinkets I Own  Made from Gorilla Hands  And you can get it  Off eatabullet.com  Oh man  There's some hot  Songs on it  It has begun  It has begun 
[01:47:00]  Alright we're going to  Take it to the  Dr. Phil  Pat O'Brien  Exchange Anthony  Yes  We'll start by playing  This little ditty  From Ray  From Deer Park  Long Island  It's Dr. Phil  And Pat O'Brien  A little sexy  Mixed tape  Remix  They're still  Coming in  By the way  Yes  They're still  Coming in  This was  Kind of cute  What's your objective  What is it you hope  To achieve  I want to fucking  Eat you  And fuck you

[01:48:00]  I'm worse off  Than you are  I fucking  Have sex  Okay  From behind  I want to lick  Your cock  Buddy  You are  Blowing it  I'll never  Look  At Pat O'Brien  The same  Way  Again  That was pretty good  That was great  That was good  You are gonna  What's with that  Cadence he has  When he talks  I don't know  But it robes me  In every time  I think 
[01:48:30]  What you have  To do  Talk like a  Human being  Maybe you just  Don't like the  Advice Dr. Phil  Is dishing out  Maybe I don't  Jimmy  When do you think  Maybe we should  Take Danny  To see Dr. Phil  I think he did  It to himself  What a southern  Dullard he is  Southern Dullard 
[01:49:00]  At first I'm watching it  I'm like  Alright well Dr. Phil  Is kind of coming on  With brutal questions  Yeah  He wasn't  Lobbing up softballs  No  But then I'm like  He's probably just  Playing the role of  I'm gonna ask you  The tough ones  That everybody's asking  This way it doesn't  Look like it was  A softball interview  Right  And then at the end  Of course  You know  Right well we got  A bunch of  Told him what he  Needs to do  Did he give him  The advice  Um  Not really  No  Nice  I mean  Scumbag  One thing I'll say  About Pat O'Brien  And he obviously  Had to say what  He had to say

[01:52:30]  Bob Eatman  Board meeting  It was boring  So Brian got stuck  In that traffic  Of course  Did he  So he's running  20 minutes late  The bomb traffic  Yeah  Do you see the way  The news is reporting  Apparently Fox News  Is breaking in  With these  Special Fox News alerts  That they do  Every five seconds  And double blast  In Midtown  At English  Embassy  Yeah  They're making 
[01:53:00]  Such a huge thing  Out of this  And it's nothing  This was a prank  Me and my friends  Used to do this  Me and my friends  Used to hollow out  Around the beginning  Of the summer  Around this time  We would have fireworks  For the 4th of July  So you get your bag  Of M80s  Which by the way  You know  What happened  To those good old days  By this time  Years ago  You were already  Getting that list  That the guy  You know  Everyone at work  Knew the guy  That gave you the list  And you'd check off  Yeah I need  A gross of these 
[01:53:30]  I need some M80s  I need rockets  And then  You'd give them back  The list with the money  And then a couple  Of weeks later  You'd have your fireworks  And you'd have  A shit load of fireworks  And you'd hear these things  Like now  From now till August  You'd hear fireworks  Anthony another wacky radio thing  I had to do  When I was working at WBAB  I had to go to one of these  Local July 4th parties  Really?  On a side street  I couldn't even tell you  Just some guy throwing it  I couldn't even tell you  I think it was like  Bayshore let's just say  It wasn't a city sanctioned thing 
[01:54:00]  It was just some guy's house  No because this is  This is over 10 years ago  Yeah  Before they  You know  All these party poopers out there  Wrecked out for us as well  Wrecked down  So now you have to go  To the local school  Or the local beach  Or the local  Now that cities go  We will take care  Of your 4th of July  Entertainment for you  There's no need  To buy fireworks  Boring  I know  What was more fun  As a kid  Than putting an M80  Under an upside down  Garbage pail  I went to this party  I went to this party  Let's just call it 
[01:54:30]  Bayshore  I don't really know  The houses were  Pretty close together  How high was the girl's hair  At the party?  Oh my god  Was it 2 or 3 feet?  Well she had the waterfall  In front  Than you were in Bayshore  Yeah  Absolutely  Were the police watching this display  And applauding as well?  Howard Beach  Yeah  The police couldn't be  Gotti used to throw  A nice 4th of July party  Well the police couldn't be bothered  Back then  And then you know  They had to start cracking down  And now you know  You light off one stupid  Bottle rock in your neighborhood  And some  There's a terrorist team  At your house  And some noisy 
[01:55:00]  Another  The word of the day  Is do-gooder  Another do-gooder neighbor  Has to call the cops on you  Relax  But I remember this party  At Bayshore  It starts off all nice  The one guy  That's controlling the whole thing  Uh huh  And then the beers  Starts flowing  Next thing  The guy  You're just waiting for disaster  I don't know why  It didn't go off  Sticking his face over the pipe  That they launched the mortars from  He's looking into the pipe  I'm like oh god  I'm gonna watch a guy  Just face just  You know  Get taken off  Uh uh uh  Looking in right  And then by the end of the party  It's just an all out war 
[01:55:30]  Like it's back  Like we're back in Civil War times  And it's like the south  Versus the north  And it's the houses  Across the street  That's it  And they're just  Fucking lighting things  What's wrong with that  Lighting things  At people  Bottle rockets  And what have you  Those little helicopters  Yeah  I love that  Hey you can hold these  In your hand  They're like whizzing  Across the street  Guys with burn marks  All over them  And by the end of this party  It was just an all out war  Yeah  It was insane 
[01:56:00]  But so much fun  That was the old days  Where you bought  Your own fireworks  You set them off  In your yard  And it was a lot of fun  Now the city does it for you  But we would buy  A bunch of these M80s  A bag full  Of nice red M80s  And uh  We'd sit in the house  Um  My friend worked  At a place called  Struthers  It was some engineering place  They had these um  Pipes  And threaded caps  And he would bring one over  Pretty good size  Diameter  Maybe a  Two 
[01:56:30]  Two and a half inch diameter  And uh  Just looking at the Photoshop  Of the kid with the  The broom  From um  Harry Potter  That we were talking about earlier  The toy broom  Uh  They Photoshopped the kid  They took the back of the broom off  So now he's just holding  The front of the broom handle  By his crotch  It looks like a big cock  Like you suggested  And it's my  Baby picture  Head on  You were such  Young Anthony  You were such a cute little boy  I was so tussleable  Look at you  Well  Yeah that's on the  Photoshop  Uh  Photoshop section of 
[01:57:00]  Wackbag.com  Michael Jackson's in the lower  Right hand corner  Very funny  He's uh  Looking on  So  Oh there's Norton  And there's Norton  Look at Norton  Open mouth face  That they've used  So many times  On Photoshop  That one is really fun  I know it's a visual  I'm sorry  But when you get home  Go to the Photoshop thread  On the  Wackbag.com message  Yeah every day  There's some funny  Photoshop's going on  Uh  We would hollow  Hollow out these  M80's  And uh  Put them in the pipe  Empty it out in the pipe  And then we would go  To the school  And every year  You know  On the football field 
[01:57:30]  Of the school  They had the bleachers  And then they had the big  Um  I don't know  It was that big  Plywood  Box on top of the bleachers  That they would announce  The game from  And it was always locked up  Yeah  And we would uh  Put the bomb in the door  Light it  Using the cigarette timer fuse  That every kid knows  Every secret agent child knows  You uh  You'd pop the filter off the cigarette  And you stick it on the fuse  And light the cigarette  Puff it real good  So it gets all cherry red 
[01:58:00]  And then you put the filter  Uh  You put the cigarette on the fuse  Oh so you got time to run away  Now you got time to run away  The cigarette burns down  Lights the fuse  And then you're standing  You're like really far away looking  And everyone's just fixated on the fuse  You can't see it  But then all of a sudden  You see like a  Puff  A little spark  And you know that the cigarette  Successfully lit the fuse  And it's only seconds before  The bomb goes off  And it would go up  And I swear to god  Half  Of the  The door  Would just  Blast out 
[01:58:30]  Wood would go flying  And we loved it  Who doesn't like a good explosion  And my point  This whole long winded story  Is that  That's what this sounds like  Oh we're back to the bomb thing right  Yeah  This isn't a double grenade bombing  At the British consulate  That needs 20 Fox News alerts  This is some idiots  Deciding they're going to  Set off what amounts  To a homemade little bomb  That's what I think  But are there any teenagers  That are pranking  Just going  Hey let's do it  In the British consulate  Well I mean 
[01:59:00]  There's something to the story  But Fox News is showing the video  And they've got a reporter  On the scene  And you know they want  The dramatic video  And the guy's sitting there  Doing his stand up report  And there's people  Going to work behind him  With their book bags  And stuff  Not too impressive  The video Fox  No  Sorry  They show the planter  Look it's fractured  They're always reaching on  Well god sorry  I hate stating the obvious  Sorry about that guys  What  Where are you going on  They're always reaching on Fox News  Sorry  Man  Jesus  The sky's also blue today 
[01:59:30]  I'm sorry  Window shattered  I just don't see  They said they saw a guy  Put this in the planner  Light it  And run away  Yeah  No note  No claims of responsibility  No you know  It's a protest of some sort  You think  Absolutely  Yeah  It wouldn't be done  Outside the British consulate  If it wasn't  Well I'd say he was trying  To kill people  Election day over there  Yeah I think it's  A presidential election  It's a protest  Or something like that  I don't know  Whatever  Those limey bastards  Who cares  They closed 15 blocks 
[02:00:00]  For what amounts to  A little friggin homemade bomb  Alright Anthony  As we go to break here  We do have the Arnold prank calls  We're kind of stalling a little bit  Because we think the Brian Regan  You know Pat O'Brien stuff  Could be a nice little thing  Yeah  Nice little thing  You want to hear the Arnold prank calls?

[02:09:30]  He's doing a huge thing at Caroline's  He's gonna be there all weekend  He sells out  So the show could be all sold out at this point  I think he's just coming in  Because he's a friend of the show  Right  We're going  Oh, we're all going  I think we're gonna go  I think we're gonna go Friday and Saturday  Really?  I love Brian Regan  And he changes up his set  I love the comedians  That, you know  Because we do a lot of hanging at these comedy clubs  And I love the guys that  You see the early show and the late show  And you're almost seeing two different shows  I love that about some of the comedians out there 
[02:10:00]  And then other guys  Man, it's the same exact act  I mean, from the first word to the last word  Even the little impromptu thing  Where you're thinking  Oh, he's riffing a little  With that audience member  It's like, oh my god  No, he's not  That's why I like, you know, Kevin Meany  It's different every time  There was one time  I swear to god  He was doing a joke  And he said and  And then the next show  He didn't say and  Get out of here  Unbelievable  I don't care  I don't care  That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about 
[02:10:30]  Hey, did you guys hear  This is funny  I should bring this up  Yeah  The new Tommy Lee show  Oh  That's all I have on it  Good one, Jimmy  Yeah, reality show  He goes back to college  Does he?  Yeah  Is that what it's about?  Yeah  Really?  How fucking stretched and forced is that?  That's what it says here on the sheet  They've run out of reality show ideas  They just really have  Put a heavy metal guy in a whole situation  You know, I don't know  I don't know about that  Because every time there's a dip in the reality shows 
[02:11:00]  Then something pops up  Like the Osbournes  And then  I hate to admit  But that Nick and Jessica show  Was pretty goofy and fun  Yeah, for a little while  To take a peek  It's the whole voyeuristic thing  We like looking in for a couple of minutes  But it gets boring  Do you watch Surreal Life?  No  Can't get enough of Surreal Life  I got bored of that too  The last one with Mini-Me  Naked all the time  And China drinking the whole time  Yeah  And Peter Brady banging that young piece of ass  I mean, it was a really, really good season  Of the Surreal Life 
[02:11:30]  You know what I do  To catch up on the reality shows?  You watch that  On E! Entertainment  You watch Soup  You ever see the show Soup?  Talk Soup  It used to be Talk Soup?  It used to be Talk Soup  Now it's just called  Soup  The Soup  The Soup  Yeah  And the host is very funny  And they show you all the clips  That you need to see  Without any filler stuff  If something funny happened  Or surprising  Boom, there it is  Not a bad idea, Anthony  Not a bad idea  Because I just can't stand  I don't know anybody 
[02:12:00]  That's watching Survivor anymore  Yet the show is doing well  It's getting massive numbers again  How does that happen?  I don't know  I don't know  Because it's the same show  It really is the same show  The shows are all  I used to be a huge  Real world fan  Back in the day  But then they started  Doing the exact same show  Just in a different city  You had the gay guy  You had the black guy  That just hated whitey  Or was all about his blackness  I get it  The girl that's a lesbian  I saw you pick your scabs  And then you put your finger  In the peanut butter, Buck 
[02:12:30]  Me and my boyfriend  We're in love  You know  He's cute  By far the best one  San Francisco  San Francisco  You're dating yourself now  With the AIDS guy  That goes back  God  Eight years now  Probably  A long time  Seven years  I don't know  Anyway  Let's go to the cooler  He's calling us from overseas  Oh  Bruce Kelly  The ONA virus  Here in London  Hi guys  Hi Bruce  Hey Bruce  How are you  Hi guys  How are you doing  Bruce Kelly  So you're in England today

[02:17:30]  Alright yeah  So Tommy Lee  Was calling a bunch  Of stations  For his latest project  And we got along  With Tommy Lee  Over the years  And what happened  Was we were fortunate  Enough that the night  Before his ex there  Pam was on  Larry King  Talking about  The hep  And all that  And pretty much  Making some outrageous  Claims about Tommy Lee  Yeah  Trash talking the guy  And we happen to  Have him on the next day  So just like what  Happened yesterday  With Jimmy Chamberlain  Of course you gotta  Mention it 
[02:18:00]  Gotta talk about it  This is the headline  This is the thing  People wanna know  Your ex was on  Larry King trash  And what do you  Have to say  Uh huh  So I think that's  The set up  When he called in  And he got really  Really pissed off at us  And this is how it went  If you're on hold  Stay there  But we gotta go  Right to the hotline  Tommy Lee  Tommy  Tommy  Who me  Yeah  Hello Mr. Lee  What's up Tommy  What's up guys  No we were just  Talking to everybody  About um  Paying for it  I know  I heard the conversation  Yeah escorts  And hookers  And stuff 
[02:18:30]  You uh  I have to assume  You've done that  A couple of times  At least  I think everyone  Should own one  Yeah  Yeah  When you're Tommy Lee  You don't have to though  Yeah see that's just it  You go out  You pick up some chick  He's a rock star  And he has a mule  The size of a small community  Everyone knows about that  Everyone's seen that  On the tape  Yeah that made for some  Great Thanksgiving  Uh viewing  Tommy  I'm so glad that  We get to talk to you today  Because I've always  Want to thank you  We brought that tape  To Thanksgiving dinner 
[02:19:00]  Swear to God  And watched it upstairs  While mom and sis  And the aunts  Were cooking the turkey  We all went upstairs  To see you rail  Uh Pam  You perverts  You perverts  You know something though  You're lucky  You're lucky  You're lucky  That you were endowed  Like that  Because it was a big hit  People saw the tape  And went wow  Look at Tommy Lee's hog  And uh  You could have been  One of those guys  A little puny thing  And then you'd be  Going through life  Embarrassed  Yeah  Okay

[02:28:00]  The P word  What  Pigger  It took us  It took a two minute conversation  To clear the air  About what happened that day  Two lousy minutes  And all the message boards spent  You know  I don't know  Three or four days  Speculating  And it was like crazy  I was walking through  Barnes and Noble  My phone rings  It's Jimmy  Less than two minutes later  It was like  Yeah alright cool  Whatever  I mean  And that was that  It was that fast  Tommy said bullshit in that call  Yeah  Oh did he  Oh wow  And that was regular radio

[02:35:00]  Is that the Foo Fighters?  Yeah  No no no  Queens of the Stone Age  That's David Grawl right?  Yeah  David Grawl from his fucking kindergarten teachers  Absolutely amazing  To know that all that talent  Was just hanging out with Kurt Cobain  And Kurt could care less  He's a good drummer  Yeah  He brought a lot of songs to Nirvana  And Kurt was like  Yeah whatever  You could just tell from the success he had  After Nirvana  That he wasn't just one of those drummers  That kind of just show up 
[02:35:30]  For the gig  Right  Who's the other guy  Besides him?  He was Nova Selle  No he was  Who?  Where?  What?  Well he started a new band recently actually  Yeah but who cares  He was just Kurt's friend  And you know whatever  He certainly isn't a Foo Fighters  Is he a bassist?  Yeah  He's a nobody  Was he the one that threw the bass up  On Saturday Night Live  And hit himself over the head?  Yeah he threw his bass up in the air  It came down  And smacked him on top of the head  And knocked him the fuck out  He's like crawling off stage  Hysterical  It was live?  Yeah  What an idiot 
[02:36:00]  Oh it was hilarious  One of the best moments in MTV history  Couldn't happen to a nicer person  He almost was knocked out cold  He staggered  Sweetie you have a little egg on your head  I know  Let me get it  I gotta shove this in  Let me get it  You got egg on your face  Oh come on  Me and Tommy have egg on our face  Well  Hey let's get Brian Regan in here  He's playing Carolines this weekend  Here in New York  Here he comes  Oh  You're on  There he is  Hey Brian  Hi sweetie  Take a seat 
[02:36:30]  Brian's fine sitting right here  There's not many people I actually enjoy sitting in that seat  That's right  Only if they lack melanin  Right or wrong Ant?  Well  Jesus Christ  Yeah  We'll never see a tippy Tom sitting there  Good morning  Good morning  How are you?  I'm doing alright  How are you guys?  Good  Good  You talk to me later after you have breakfast  I will  See that's the way we operate here on the show 
[02:37:00]  We take turns eating  I see  The show's finished  Look I have my banana peel and tin foil  The show starts at 7  Ant and I do some cute banter  While Jimmy eats  And then after Jimmy's done  He now joins the program  And then Anthony listens a little bit  And then he shoves down his bagel and tuna fish  And then I eat  And then I need like a second breakfast right around now  So you can  If you have three you can do it  Yeah  You've got one guy eating while two talk  Yeah  One guy  If there were only two guys it would sound really stupid 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  One guy would be talking  And the other guy not talking  Or talking with his mouth full  How was your morning?  Whom  Whom  Whom  Whom  Whom  But three guys  Three guys  Works out great  Four would be great  One could actually nap  Uh huh  Because we get a little sleepy in the morning  One could eat  One could talk  One could jump out of the console and suck all their cocks  If you've got enough guys  You know you just gotta make sure you've got enough guys for that sort of thing  It's all a numbers thing 
[02:38:00]  Yeah  That's why some shows I guess have a lot of guys  Yeah  You never know what's going on  You know when you go into a radio show and there's only one guy  You know that's not going to happen  No  But when there's a handful there you're like hey  You know  Who's under the console?  You don't know  So there have been some grenades?  Yeah  Apparently you were stuck in some traffic  Well I was stuck in Newark traffic  Oh  I flew  Well not Newark  I mean Newark to here  Yeah  What do you call that? 
[02:38:30]  I don't know if there's a name for that traffic  But uh  It's called Phil  They just call it Phil  Really?  It's uh  It's traffic from Newark  Okay  Through the Lincoln right from Newark Airport  Correct  Yeah  But uh  We heard on the radio about the uh  The grenade  The grenadings  I don't think that's a word  Grenading  The grenadings  Uh  But the last I heard was that the grenades were planted in a planter  Yeah  Is that what you do with a grenade?  Don't you pull the pin and haul?  You pull the pin and you bury it in a planter? 
[02:39:00]  You're supposed to throw it  Like anytime I saw it you throw it  Yeah  Yeah you run as quickly as you can when you do that sort of thing  And then throw away or you take cover  You don't have a little gardening shovel  I know  And then you pull the pin and then you start digging a little hole  What are you doing?  I'm doing a terrorist act  Hang on  I've got my little gardening spade  And I gotta get this what like six inches deep  And now I haul 
[02:39:30]  Got a little ruler to make sure he's planting it deep enough  Yeah  It's gotta be  I don't know how low you're supposed to plant those things  You can plant a grenade  That's what I heard  That's what I heard  It's probably incorrect information  But anyway  More morons  It turned out to be really nothing  Good  It was just  It was fake grenades  Yeah  It was one of those  What I heard was it was one of those grenades  That bosses put on their desk  Or you see at a department store  In the complaints section  It says  For complaints take a number 
[02:40:00]  And the number is on the pin  Oh  You know  Those things  They're a scream  Who would want to blow one of those up  Because they're just such a scream  And then someone hollowed it out  Put some black powder in there  And the news was so eager  To sensationalize and scare us with this  That they actually tried to make a tie-in  To the Oklahoma City bombing  They said  The grenade was hollowed out  And filled with black powder  Which could be made from fertilizer 
[02:40:30]  Which was used in the Oklahoma City bombing  Man  Man  It was like six degrees of separation  To Oklahoma City bombing  They're trying to  What did I hear?  I heard bombing  New York City  Oklahoma City bombing  Must be the same thing  They love scaring the crap out of you  On Fox News  Hope he is officially finished  And can now join the conversation  A couple of swallows  And I'm right back in  And I'm back in  There you go  That's what the guy under the console says 
[02:41:00]  A couple of swallows  And I'm back in  Back in the saddle  Hey Brian  How are you?  I'm doing good  How are you?  I'm good  Doing alright  We were just talking about a grenade  Oh yeah  Here in New York City  That seemed to have been a little problem  Very good  Grenading  As Brian so eloquently put it  Grenading  Brian we stalled the whole show  To get you in here  Yeah  I'm sorry about being late  No we still did good radio  It's not like the old days  Where we just stank and wait for you  We actually did some good stuff  Alright  But we wanted to save the Dr. Phil Pat O'Brien stuff for you 
[02:41:30]  You familiar with Pat O'Brien?  Yes  Yes  Pat O'Brien situation  I saw some of it last night  They had it on TV  Did they play any of the tapes?  Some of it  Of course everything was bleeped out  Have you heard?  Even Betsy's name  What?  Even Betsy's name  Was bleeped out  Betsy's name was bleeped out?  Yeah it said expletive  Expletive and then it said name  When they beeped it out  Wow  Betsy  Because we have the  That's his girlfriend?  Unedited  Well that's one of the girls  That were supposed to be involved in this  There was a 
[02:42:00]  See he's married  No no no  Divorced  He's divorced  He's divorced now yeah  But he has a girlfriend  I guess named Betsy  Okay  And then another girl  That he was trying to seduce  To share his bed with him and Betsy  I'm going to go out on a limb  And I'm going to say that  I don't think that Brian does coke  And you know makes these phone calls  Wow you're really going out on a limb there  I'm going to say you're not like Pat O'Brien  Where you get all jacked up  And then want to have all sorts of sex  With other women  I'm going with Pat O'Brien's answer 
[02:42:30]  Well wait it was Sunday  It was Sunday  Oh exactly  I wasn't working  You know what I mean?  Is that an excuse?  That's what he said  Well wait I say  It was Sunday now  You know it wasn't working  Have you heard the tapes unedited?  No  Oh they are a scream  Oh they really are good  No I know  I've seen your stand up many many times  And I've never heard anything  That even comes close  To what was on these Pat O'Brien's  Now I don't know how comfortable  You're going to be listening to some of them 
[02:43:00]  Maybe we shouldn't be playing these  Can you guys bleep it?  Can you guys bleep it out for me?  You know so I won't actually have to hear  The rougher language  See this is satellite radio  And we're not allowed to bleep  It actually has to go out  Oh it has to go out  There's an FCC law  They figured  They have to be involved in some capacity  So they said  We're not allowed to be clean  We can't bleep  Or else we'll be fine  Well this is how the other radio stations were playing it  You are so hot  And we're not allowed to bleep

[02:47:00]  The whole thing in the proper context  Maybe it was wholesome  It could have been something like  What I would never say  On a recorded message  Is something like  I want to lick your pussy  Exactly  Right  He could have said  Could you imagine  If I was the kind of guy  That would say this  And then he says those things  Right  And of course I'm not  And they edit that whole part out  Yeah  That's a good observation  He never looked at it that way  I just like watching Brian  Listen to these tapes  He's squirming a little  Like  Can you believe  The way  This guy was so worked up 
[02:47:30]  That he had to leave messages  Like this on this girl's machine  Well she was in the room  That's what we hear  That's what's so weird about it  What was it  A room or  I heard it was a restaurant  What was it  No I thought they were  At their hotel  And  They were at a restaurant  Originally  This is what  It was on Dr. Phil  Last night  And then they went back  To the hotel  And he's calling  It must be a hell of a hotel room  That you're calling someone  On a cell phone  I don't know how large  That hotel room  That's what I heard  In the room  Well he was probably 
[02:48:00]  With Betsy  Yeah  He was with the Betsy girl  Trying to talk her  Into the whole thing  So maybe the other girl  Wasn't in the room  It was probably like a suite  Yeah  Maybe a suite  Maybe she was staying  In another room  Or another bedroom  In the suite  Well no  If he says wink at me  Yeah  It's got to be in the same  They could  Picture this  If you will  It's him  Betsy  And this other chick  In the suite  Yeah  Betsy  He's trying to talk  Betsy into the whole thing  So he's trying to let  The other girl know  That once he talks

[02:56:30]  The big sit down  With Dr. Phil  Was last night  And I guess  Brian saw some of that  Put a huge batch of  French dressing  On your face  Some creamy Italian  Well what if he just says  Everything with that  Same zeal  You know  I want you to bring  Some breadsticks  To the table  And I want you to  Clunk them down  Like you've never  Clunked a bread basket  On a table before  And I want the rolls  Just hanging over the side  Of the bread basket  You know  Like nice hot 
[02:57:00]  Hot bowls  I want a coke  No ice  Yeah  And a straw  And I'm gonna suck that straw  I'm gonna suck the coke  Through the straw  Suck it  Oh man  Oh this  These fajitas are so hot  These fajitas are so fucking hot  So it was Pat O'Brien  And Dr. Phil last night  Norton saw it as well  Yeah  What was  Overall  What were you thinking there  Again at first  I thought wow  Dr. Phil is really asking 
[02:57:30]  Tough questions  Because he really wasn't  Letting him off the hook  But then as it went on  I realized  That is scumbag  He's just  He's doing what he thinks  He has to do  To make it look like  He asks the tough questions  And at the end  He lets him off the hook  Let's him off the hook  Like I know that you're  A good person  Deep down  Yeah  Crap  What about the letter  That was sent in  The nice letter  You know  It almost sounded  Like kind of Pat  You know  Not Pat  No pun intended  But the guy that  Somebody wrote in  Saying boy  It's been such a pleasure 
[02:58:00]  Working with you  And you know  It was this real  Like you know  Really good sighted  Letter to try to  To try to compensate  For all that  For all that  One letter  Three hours long  To compensate  It could be signed  Jesus Christ  And it still ain't  Gonna come  All right  Well let's go to  Some of the clips  Here  Let's hear some  Of the clips  Everybody's gotta  Hit the bottom  And I hit my bottom  That horrible weekend  In New York City  I don't like that  I remember most of it 
[02:58:30]  No  And that's what  The bottom is  It was a  Weekend of  Fun  I thought  A weekend of drinking  And  Which turned into  A little bit of craziness  A little bit of craziness  Understating  A little bit of craziness  Brian how many times  You have a little fun  A little drinking  And you're on that cell phone  A little bit of craziness  A little craziness  I'm gonna sound  Maybe like the only person  That's like  Wondering this  But you know  He's  He was with his girlfriend 
[02:59:00]  If his girlfriend  Was willing  And the woman  Was willing  Where was the  The harm  Right  You know what I'm saying  Something tells me  She wasn't that willing  Not Betsy  The other one  I don't know  If she was willing  Why the hell  Are they on the phone  You close that deal  There's no need  To make ten phone calls  I'll bet you  She flirted  Or did like  Oh I'd love to get  With you two  You know how dumb women  Can be  And he was just  Trying to be funny  Or to be endearing  And he just picked up 
[02:59:30]  On it  Coked up  With his coke  And his  Sialis hard on  And his  Flothing mouth  And he couldn't  Get it out of his head  That's a guy  He could not  Get that out of his head  And had to pursue it  And that's what happened  He's got a slug trail  Of clear stuff  Down his side  Oh hey  You know  It's like  Whatever the girl's name is  Hi I'd like to introduce you  To my girlfriend  Betsy  Oh Betsy  That's a nice shirt  You're wearing  You want to fuck her  You want to lick her ass  No I was complimenting  Her shirt  I was just saying 
[03:00:00]  That I like that color  Yeah  You all know what that means  And he probably  Flirted with her  And she probably  Didn't want to tell him  To shut the fuck up  You're annoying me  And she probably  Oh Pat  You're too much  And he took that  And that's a signal  Well  But she took  Your cards right  But to take the devil's advocate  She took ten cell phone calls  You know  I mean  If she wasn't interested  After two  Why is she  Continuing to take  The phone calls  I think those were messages  Huh  I think those were messages  I thought they were  Having a conversation  No  He just seemed to be  The only one that said it 
[03:00:30]  Those are messages  He left  Oh okay  I thought they deleted  Everything she said out  And I thought  That was a little unfair  You know  Oh I thought her voice was  Next message  Yeah you're so fucking hot  If you want to eat Betsy's ass  Just press zero  Alright let's go to another clip here  Now you and your girlfriend  Were out in New York City  Correct?  Yes  You go to a restaurant  You and your girlfriend  And you encounter this other woman  We'll call her Jay 
[03:01:00]  Lady Jay  Are you drinking at the restaurant?  Yeah absolutely  Drinking heavily  Was it a Sunday afternoon?  I think it was a Sunday afternoon  Went to a restaurant  Drank a lot as I normally would do  On a Sunday afternoon  Time off  Not working  A single guy with  My girlfriend in New York City  Any drugs involved?  There was a small amount of cocaine  I used to do a lot of cocaine  Back in the 70s and 80s  And cocaine trumps everything  What happens is  Your mind says don't do this  And the dick says  A body says keep going 
[03:01:30]  Party  Go go go go  So you're drinking and doing coke  Small amount of coke  A lot of alcohol  Small amount of coke  Is kind of like being  Sort of pregnant  It puts you at a whole other level  It's a horrible horrible job  Oh you tell him Dr. Phil  You tell him  I tell you Dr. Phil  Doesn't pull punches  First of all  There's no small amount of coke  No such thing  When you're doing coke  You do it  Till there's no coke left  And then you get more coke  Or you spend the rest of your day  Getting coke  If he didn't have coke 
[03:02:00]  He wouldn't be making these calls  He'd be looking for coke  You don't stop doing coke during the day  You run out of coke  After doing massive amounts of coke  Brian you agree with that right  Yeah  I concur  Remember the 80s Brian  We were all just snorting up  Yes  You know what I hated about coke  In the 80s  Is at least pot  You know  Everybody at the parties  Welcome to some  Yeah 
[03:02:30]  Even if you're not interested  That's true  Hey you want some  No  Hey how about you  No  Everybody's welcome to some  Coke  Parties would faction off  People would go into other rooms  Closets  Yeah  A bedroom door would open  And some guy would come out  And go  Hey Charlie  And Susie  Come on in  Come in  And you're sitting out  You're sitting out on the couch  You know  Watching Andy Griffith  Wow  What's going on back there  You guys are missing a great 
[03:03:00]  Andy Griffith episode  You gotta check out  What Aunt Bea's up to  What are you  What are y'all doing in there  Charlie  Susan  Oh man  That's brutal  So true  You nailed it  Only your bestest pal  That's what I hated about it  That's what I hated about it  Was that you know  If there's a drug or something at a party  Everybody should be welcome to it  Even if you ain't interested  It's like you're getting picked for a team  Yeah 
[03:03:30]  That just spells it all out  Because you could be at a concert  And sitting there  And some guy you don't know next to you  You go  Dude  Yes  Want a hit  And you just smoke pot  And watch you know  Charlie Daniels  Yeah  You pass it on  And everything is cool  But Coke was not like it  No  Very selective  And even as a friend  Sometimes you'd have to beg  Come on  Give me a little  You're my identical twin  For Christ's sake  Come on  You got enough there  A little bit  Just one  Please 
[03:04:00]  Alright  We're literally joined at the hit  We're Siamese twins  And you won't share  It's gonna get in the system anyway  Look  I'll suck your cock  I'll get  I'll get Betsy in here  Yeah  Oh poor Betsy  Man  A little bit of coke  Let's go to another clip  So you  Your girlfriend  And this other woman  You leave the restaurant  You leave and go back to the Four Seasons in New York  And have a couple bottles of wine  It's a great plug for the Four Seasons  And I've just been told what happened the rest of the time 
[03:04:30]  And you began to call this woman on her cell phone from your cell phone  Although you were in the same room  I don't remember making the calls  I do not remember that at all  You were making the  Did you  Why did you not just get up and go talk to her?  I was loaded out of my mind  I was loaded  What I'm trying to do is just get straight in my mind  You're making these calls to a woman that's 20, 30, 50 feet away 
[03:05:00]  I'm in the other room  And I remember picking up the phone  I don't remember saying  Yeah sure  What I hear  I have no memory of saying  Hookers and cocaine  That's not me  In fact that wasn't me on the phone  Just even in that context  And he goes  Hookers and cocaine  Yeah let's pick some up  It just gets all dirty again with Dr. Phil  Me, you, Betsy, Dr. Phil  Everybody  Come on  Carl Young  We'll juggle  Did Dr. Phil ask the question we all want to know  If they had the threesome? 
[03:05:30]  No, Dr. Phil didn't get into that  Oh come on  Are you kidding me?  He talked about a great dad Pat O'Brien is  And they showed pictures of his son  Oh yeah  Who does resemble Rocky Dennis  It was awful  Oh my god  Sorry  See the four seasons  I mean those are the kind of hotel rooms  I guess if you have a suite there  It would be big enough where you could call somebody on a cell phone  That's a great point  This would not be happening at a Motel 6  You know  Yeah  I'm sitting on my twin bed  And she's over  She's over on the other twin bed  So  I pick up my cell phone 
[03:06:00]  And I call her  And I'm like  Hey  Hey you  Do you see Betsy and I over here  On this twin bed?  Would you want to walk the one foot over here  And  You know  And join us?  If you're into this  Walk over by the sink  That's not in the same room as the toilet  Yes  We have one of those real thin towels  That are frayed and have holes in them 
[03:06:30]  Oh we got the nice letter from  Let's go to this  Oh the sweet letter  We got that now  Yeah we didn't have this  The letter that makes up for everything  But we got  Neutralizes the whole deal  We got an amazing staff here  And they came up with this  Because you mentioned it Brian  Let's see  Okay here it is  Great staff  It is a huge huge thing  To step up  And acknowledge this  And deal with it  Instead of running from it  I've surrendered myself  To this program  And it's step by step  I want to tell you something 
[03:07:00]  I know about you  That you don't know  I know about you  I have had  A number of opportunities  To observe you  When nobody knew  That I was watching  Creepy  And what I have seen  Is a dedicated  Loving  And sensitive father  Insensitive father  That made it all about  They should be playing  Let's go crazy  As Dr. Phil gives  Is that music really 
[03:07:30]  All happening in the background  During your  While they sing  There's a fireplace  In the background  They're sitting on these  Two nice chairs  In a suite  And there's a little  Fireplace burning  Fire's burning  It's so fucking hot  Out  That boy  Honestly  Genuinely  That's Pat O'Brien  This is not Pat O'Brien  And out of the people  In this world  Who know that  Put me at the top 
[03:08:00]  Of that list  Thank you  And to whom much is given  Much is expected  It's going to be  Interesting to  Watch you continue  To overcome this  I won't let you down  I won't let you down  Dr. Phil was spying  On Pat O'Brien  Yeah  Lurking in the bushes  And Pat O'Brien  Didn't notice  All the camera crews around  So next time  He's on a coke bender  And drunk  And there's two chicks  Naked on his bed 
[03:08:30]  In a hotel suite  And he's ready  To pounce on them  He'll go  You know  I can't let  Dr. Phil down  I'm not going to partake  Sorry gals  I'm out of here  Yeah  Sure  Well he'll just make sure  He's not being observed  To look out the window  To make sure  Jeffrey Tambor  Isn't staring at him  Through the bushes  Jeffrey Tambor  Fucking asshole  Not exactly alike  Stupid perfectly  Quant mustache  Boosebag  Here's the nice letter 
[03:09:00]  From the co-workers  By the way  That was another clip  It says  Pat  I remember how encouraging  You were to me  In the first few days  Leading up to the launch  Of the insider  Undoubtedly sensing  I was restless  About whether  I was going to stay  In this frenzied business  When dealing with  The craziness  And tooling up  You took precious time  You didn't have  To compliment my work ethic  And insist that I stick with it  I know  And will never forget  What Pat O'Brien  Is truly made of  You have shown me 
[03:09:30]  A passionate  Good-natured  Hard-working professional  And that you are  A proud father  And a strong leader  Take time  For yourself  Another one  That has written  The benefits  Of finding yourself again  Will be worth  The pain  The suffering  Even the embarrassment  Anger  And sadness  Because then  We get  To have all  Of Pat O'Brien  It makes my heart  Warmer to hear 
[03:10:00]  Those letters  My heart's  So fucking hot  My heart is  So fucking warm  That is really bad  Isn't it  Dr. Phil  Should be executed  It's just awful  Do you concur  Brian  That Dr. Phil  Should be executed  As Jimmy has  You know  I didn't see  The last 15 minutes  I saw the first  The first part  Like you did  And I thought  He was  You know  Going after them  And making them  Answer the questions  But I didn't hear  That last part  Until just now  It's all schmaltzy  And nice  With the music 
[03:10:30]  In the background  Was there literally  Like a guy  With a violin  That came up  And started playing  Like leaning over  Between them  That would be  A good parody  For SNL to do  They won't think  Of it though  Believe me  Of course they won't  Let's see  Here's another clip  That is you  That's your voice  That's not me  But that's your voice  That's my voice  That's me saying  That's on someone's phone  I do not remember  Making that call  But now that I've heard it  Again there's a key line  In there  And that  I don't know why  I'm doing this

[03:15:30]  Way after the uh  The tasting was complete  Could  Could I possibly say anything clean  Looking at these uh  Those dirty dirty places  It's a whole book full of dirtiness  Let's go to Weave in Oregon  Weave  Hey Brian  Yes sir  You killed in Portland  You killed in Portland Oregon Sunday night  It was a fucking awesome show  Hey thanks man  There you go  Appreciate that  I was really looking forward to seeing you live  And I couldn't have been any happier  It was totally awesome 
[03:16:00]  Thank you very much  You're very kind  I've seen Brian Regan at least a dozen times  He never disappoints  He never has a bad night  He's just incredible  He's playing New York all weekend long  The tickets are going fast  For his shows at Caroline's  You came from Oregon to here  Well I guess a few days in between  I was in Portland Sunday night  And then I flew here on the Red Eye  And then I taped Letterman Monday  That's going to air tomorrow night  Oh okay  Nice  Oh we got to check you out on Letterman  And then I went home for a couple days  To see the wife and kids 
[03:16:30]  You have more than one now right  I have three wives  Yeah  Two kids  How old's the young one?  A year and a half  Oh my gosh  You're even out of touch  Yeah  A little toddler  I remember the first one  Now you're up to two  That's great  Yeah  Alright let's go back to the tapes here  Petal Brian and Dr. Phil  Another clip  And you don't sound that drunk on the tape  To me I didn't  You sound high  But you don't sound that drunk  Well I had three or four bottles of wine  Two bottles of champagne  Two glasses  Get me drunk  But you can't stop 
[03:17:00]  The drive in my brain says  Don't stop Pat  Keep going  You sound very efficient  Very articulate  But I want to know  Because you remember enough about the night  To remember your mindset  I'll take responsibility for every word of that  Because I did it  That's my voice  But Phil that is not me  I was fueled up on alcohol  I'm an alcoholic  I'm an addict  I was saying things that  When I hear that  I can't believe I said them  I don't remember saying 
[03:17:30]  It's so hurtful  I've already blocked it out now  I mean it's ridiculous  I'm just not buying it  He remembers making these phone calls  He's been around long enough to know what he's got to do  Well he remembers  You know  In the interview he was saying  I remember being on the other side of the room  He remembers certain things  Everything right up to the point  He doesn't remember any of the graphic language  Yeah spewing that out  I don't remember  And you know  Yeah it was me  You can hear the voice is mine  But that isn't me 
[03:18:00]  No that is so exactly him  That's it  That's him not in front of the camera  Delivering his gossip on The Insider  Whatever the hell show he's on  The Insider  Yeah  His big comeback tonight  Tonight  Gotta watch it  Because he's probably going to have some kind of an apology  He'll probably have the  Mea culpa  Yeah  He'll have that prepared statement that  I hate personally  When these guys have that fake  Oh we love it  I don't think he's going to do his show by cell phone  No  Well that's  Jimmy had a good line yesterday  All of a sudden 
[03:18:30]  All of a sudden the cell phone rings  During the Insider  Just kinfolks or whatever  Oh that's great  Or I have to make a call  Whatever the line was  But it's really fun  Hey one of the bathroom  I don't do this for a living  I told you about it  That's great  I'm not a big star  I'm a journalist  And I never for once thought  All the  I'm pulling something over the viewer  I don't know what I was thinking there Phil  Nothing ever clicked with you that  If I'm given this national platform  I've got to adhere to this stand  Absolutely  I mean we have the greatest jobs in the world  You know it's not heavy lifting 
[03:19:00]  And we're accountable to those people out there  And I know that  I think about that every day  But on this weekend  That you have this craziness  That I inflicted upon myself  And upon people out there  And whoever went on the internet  And listened to it  I'm accountable to that  You mean everybody in the world?  Taking it  Whoever downloads  Well I was watching Andy Griffith  So I didn't hear anything about it  The whole world has heard that audio  Everyone has heard this  Alzar Cowie put that on his website 
[03:19:30]  It's on his iPod  Download it to the iPod  Laughing their asses off  These dumb Americans  What is your opinion of women?  Well not like that  That's not my opinion of women  I work in an office  That has more than half the staff are women  And haven't had one problem at work  Not a problem  And I respect women  I respect what they stand for  And if I'm a woman  I don't want to hear that stuff 
[03:20:00]  But if I'm a caring  A smart  And a forgiving woman  You're going to say  You know what?  That can't be him  That can't be the pattern in his life  And it's not  Yeah you're hoping  You respect women  I still got to get some pussy out there  So I got to  Please  Here's Sean in New Jersey  With the obvious line  Sean go ahead  Hey Pat O'Brien  I should change the name of his show  To the inside her  Oh very clever  Very nice  Right  Very good  Like that  When you're sitting there talking  To someone like Billy Joe 
[03:20:30]  And you say  Tell me what's going on  And he's out of control  Binging  Had to go to rehab  Nothing ever clicked  With you sitting there saying  You know what?  I'm worse off than you are  I ought to do what you did  Well you know  I've covered everybody  That's had problems like that  I always was sympathetic to them  And said  Hey I hope you're okay  I was lying to myself  Billy Joe  I want to ram my car  Into your house 
[03:21:00]  I want to take my car  And shove it into your garage  Let's go to John  Just me, you  And Brenda, and Eddie  Wow  Let's go to John in Jersey  You want Captain Jack  To lick your ass  John in Jersey  What's up?  What's up boys?  He used to be  The greatest excuse ever though  Because I got away  With his name  When he asked him  I remember making those phone calls  I don't remember  I was plastic  A few years ago 
[03:21:30]  A bunch of us  Had gone out drinking and stuff  And I took my  Best friend's wife  Back to her place  He was outside  Their apartment  Hanging out  And we went upstairs  And we fucked her out  I never nailed her  But I came really close  The next day  I called out  And she's like  Well do you remember  What we did last night  That we talked about  She goes  Well you know  We messed her up  No we didn't  Listen I was so drunk  I'm sorry  I don't remember it  And I'm telling you man  I got away with it  It's the biggest  Excuse because  It leaves the element of doubt 
[03:22:00]  It's that when you say  I don't remember  I don't know  I didn't do this  I don't know  Don't remember it  It's like alright  I'd love for him to say  Yes I did it  But he's not saying it  Bill Clinton should have  Thought of that  I don't remember that  I was smashed  I want a spooge  On your dress  I want to put a cigar  In your pussy  I just want to go crazy  Oh we did  Gotta love it  Alright  Chris what's up  Hey what's going on  Hey 
[03:22:30]  I just saw this link  On FARC here  It's to like  Outtake to that  Pat O'Brien  Dr. Phil interview  Oh yeah  And it's Pat O'Brien  He's talking about  Going and harassing  Some donut lady  Oh yeah  I want a twisty goo  Up your ass  I want a lemon twitter  And a honey curl  Wow  That does sound dirty  When you put it 
[03:23:00]  In that context  Pat O'Brien  Incorporating Brian  Into his perverted phone  Go  Yeah you're going to  Want to fuck me  I'm two plate guy  That's what I am  Me you thunder  Me and Betsy  And you too  You too  In case you come in here  You too  In case you want to  Join us  Let's get some drugs  A cup of dirt  Me and you  Maybe some peanut butter  And jelly  In the same jar  You know where I'm  Coming from 
[03:23:30]  I want to go crazy  I want to go crazy  Man get some  Fig Newtons  Get a  Get a Newton chipper  If you're into this  Just put a pop tart  In your toaster  Yeah  When I see that thing  Pop up  I'll know  It's an A-OK  I think we got  Like two more clips here  There are those  Who believe  That you fled  To rehab  To create  An excuse  An explanation  For getting busted 
[03:24:00]  On the  Inappropriate  Sexual behavior  That made it  On to the internet  True or false  That's false  That's false  I fled because  I was dying  I came back home  From New York  And when confronted  I said  You know what  I gotta go  I've gotta go  But even then  Didn't you only go  After people  Learned about  These tapes  Didn't they come  To your house  And do an intervention  And confront you 
[03:24:30]  You didn't even know  About the tapes  Right  I had no idea  So you say you did it  Because you felt like  You had to save your life  But you didn't  Come to that awareness  Until somebody  Grabbed you  And rattled you  Finally  And said  Enough's enough  Not once  Did I say  Oh this is a good way  To get rid of this publicity  Because the publicity  Hadn't happened yet  This was not a preemptive strike  To try to  Preemptive strike  To stay alive  I went into rehab  So I could see my son  Graduate from college  So I could see my show  Get better  So I could see me get better  Just saved my life 
[03:25:00]  If it's my recovery  Nobody else's  Yeah  They don't have that rule though  When people are graduating  They don't ask people coming in  Have you gone to rehab  Have you gone  Do you have your certificate  From rehab  We can't let you in  Unless you've gone to rehab  I'll see my son  Bring girls home  Pete from Connecticut  Has something  Pete what's up  Yeah  I don't normally do this  But Brian  I want you to give me  Tickets to a comedy show  I want you to  Grab the microphone  And I want you to 
[03:25:30]  Make me laugh  I want you to  Make me go crazy  I want you to  I want you to  Tell jokes  And tell a punchline  Just make me go  I don't know  I gotta go  I bet these folks  I gotta go  Guy seems to like your act  Oh man  That's funny  Okay let's go  To the last book here  Do you fear that  Female celebrities  That you would  Seek to interview  Are gonna resist that 
[03:26:00]  And say  I don't wanna talk to him  He doesn't deserve  To talk to me  I don't wanna validate him  By an interview  Yeah it's not a fear  It's a concern  Celebrities are human beings too  And a lot of  These folks have been  Through their own  Personal trials  And tribulations  So I'm  I'm hoping that  They have some  Empathy for what  I've been through  Knowing what  They've been through  Isn't it supposed  To be the other way around  Like now he's supposed  To have the empathy  When he  Blindsides some of these  People with things  In their personal life 
[03:26:30]  That now he's supposed  To go  Ah  Perhaps I shouldn't  Be so critical  And female celebrities  Don't give a shit  Woody Allen  Took Polaroids  Of his fucking  Stepdaughter  Then married her  And they work with him  They don't care  Where's the problem  No no no  I'm saying that  They understand a good man  I don't know how  It's gonna work  With him going back  On that show  Everyone gets used to it  They don't care  It's gonna be a novelty  Tomorrow  You know tune in  And watch him  Apologize a little bit  I think it's one  Of those things  Where it couldn't be worse 
[03:27:00]  So it can only get better  You know what I mean  Yeah yeah  He kind of  I mean what other  What other tape  Could possibly come out  That would like go  Man you thought  That was bad  I mean this is  As bad as it can be  You know what I mean  And he's already  You know  Trying to get past it  Calling an elementary  School boy  The same phone call  Would probably be worse  Yeah I guess so  I guess so  There's not many things  That could be worse  I think is what you're trying  I heard there was a picture  Of him beating off  There was a rumor  There was a picture  Yeah well that's right  I forgot about that  Yeah a picture of him 
[03:27:30]  All jacked off  Jacked off on Cokes  Sweating and red  Using his own cell phone  To take the picture  Of himself  Not realizing how damaging  This cell phone has been  To his life  Maybe he should just  Give away the cell phone  You gotta drop  Your Verizon plan  Go back to the old  Hardwired black phone  In his house  I'm thinking  Maybe when you need to  Crank and get Sarah on  Sarah  Or find a telephone pole  Sarah  Sarah  Get me Betsy  I'm thinking I have  Too many minutes  On my plan 
[03:28:00]  Maybe you need  A two minute plan  Yeah right  Maybe this free weekend  Calling is not a good idea  Sarah  Pat  Could you patch me  Through to Betsy  Yes Sarah  You're so fucking hot  Alright we have  One more clip here  Anthony  That was the big  The big sit down  Last night  And I guess  Pat O'Brien  Called Dr. Phil  To thank him  Oh really  For everything he did  To get his career  Back on track  Isn't that nice  And I'm sure we have  The exclusive  Yeah we have  The exclusive audio  Brian  Oh 
[03:28:30]  Yeah listen to this  What's your objective  What is it you hope  To achieve  I wanna fucking  Eat you  And fuck you  And  Suck your cock  Hey buddy  Wow  You need to slow down  Read off your face  This is nasty  I don't want you badly  I don't know you want me  What a creep  I wanna fucking  Make you cum  So much  Any drugs involved  I just fucking  Have sex  And fun  Drugs

[03:29:30]  There man  That's no editing  You can tell  From that phone call  That Pat O'Brien  Hasn't learned his lesson  Right  Why would he call  Dr. Phil  And say those things  To Dr. Phil  He hasn't learned his lesson  Proves our whole point  He needs to go back  I think  And have another  Little sit down  Another sit down  Alright  We're gonna play  One more remix  Going into break  And then we'll continue  With Brian Regan  Absolutely  At Tower Lines  All this weekend  In New York  What's the phone number  I don't even know  If there are tickets available  If they are  Any tickets left  Well  You don't know either  I don't know Brian  You know what you gotta say 
[03:30:00]  You gotta go  I'm Brian Regan  Of course it's sold out  No  I think  Look how humble  I don't know  I have no idea  Let me tell you  How popular Brian Regan is  Saturday night  He's got three shows  Three shows  Just to try to  Accommodate everybody  One night  You're doing the 1230 show  Oh  And then what  Wow  The last time I was at Caroline's  I went to one of these  Three show things  Yeah  And I heard it on tape  One of our replays  Audience of Pat O'Brien  How  Well how  Brian was getting  A little uptight  Because the audience 
[03:30:30]  Is yelling stuff at him  That I remember  Being in the green room  As he's doing shots  To try to calm his nerves  For a third show  And I'm like  This isn't the Brian I know  Shut up  Motherfucker  Right  Actually you guys  Have done  You guys have helped me out  With that  You kind of put the word out  Not to yell constantly  During performances  And yeah  We really mean it too  Because Brian  His stuff is so good  And he's always coming out  This is what frustrates me  And I'm going to say it again  I heard this on the replay as well 
[03:31:00]  But it's worth repeating  I get frustrated  Being a Brian Regan fan  When I know you got new material  You always do  Every time I see you  And guys are yelling out  Old bits  That you are going to get to  As kind of like  Your encore or whatever  Or your final set of songs  Or whatever  If you use the band mentality  But they start yelling out stuff  And you are so nice  That you're like  Alright  And you do these bits  And I know all that new material  That you were going to do  You're just not going to have time for  I appreciate it  What's bizarre 
[03:31:30]  Is that like  You're damned if you do  Damned if you don't  In terms of like  Because some people  Want to hear older stuff  Some people want to hear newer stuff  I did a show one time  You know that feeling  You know when you like  You have a really great set  And you get off stage  You feel good about yourself  I was in Jacksonville  And I had this really good show  And I walk off stage  And this woman grabs my arm  And I have this joke  About a dog  She goes  You didn't do the dog  Thanks a lot  Oh god damn  And then she points to her table  I brought everyone to see it  Thank you 
[03:32:00]  Holy Jesus  Yeah I'm just like  My god  Did you punch her in the face  I was going to say  I punched her  How bad did you want to  Punch her in the face  When I grabbed my cell phone  And I called her  And I talked to her  Dirty me  You and the dog  You and the dog  Everybody at your table  So we encourage you guys  To please  Please not do that  You're there to see  A genius at work  Let him work  Let him choose  What he feels  Is good to do  On that evening  People are cool  No they're idiots 
[03:32:30]  Brian  And we understand that  You hate them  It's alright  All audiences  Whether it's radio  Television  Stand up  They're all buffoons  That we hate  Don't worry  You can say it on the air  What you were saying off mic  Don't worry about it  We call our audience pests  They're pests  Hey lady with the dog bed  Brian won't say it  So I will  He hope your legs  Are severed in a train accident  Fuck you and your friends  Bitch  That was off air  Norton  Come on  We're going to finish up  With Brian Regan 
[03:33:00]  We're going to play  One more remix here  Because this  Was this Nathaniel's right  Nathaniel came up  With this one today  Hello  This is best time  I want to fucking  Go crazy with you  You're weird  You're so fucking hot  That's nice  I want to fucking  Eat you  Yeah  And fuck you  Yes  And suck your tits  Give me a shower  I want to fucking  I want to fucking  Lick your pussy  And make you  Cump  So much

[03:34:00]  Open your veins  Calling all freaks  That would make it work  That's funny  We're hanging with  Brian Regan  At Caroline's  All weekend long  The phone number  If you want to go see  Brian  212-757-4100  Thank you Jimmy  Wow 
[03:34:30]  Thank you very much  Yeah these shows  Are selling out though  So don't delay  Just make the phone call now  You're gonna see a great show  And it's very interesting  We interview a lot of comedians  We're friends with a lot of comedians  And a lot of times  We can't be bothered  We have other things  We need to do  Brian I'm telling you though man  I mean Greg from Caroline's  He's losing his mind  Because he has so many  Ticket requests  From people that work here  He doesn't know what to do  Everyone is going  Everyone you see  Is going to see you  On one of those nights 
[03:35:00]  Pat from Munaki  Says he's showing up  Friday at the 8 o'clock show  Our own Pat from Munaki  Pat from Munaki  All right  All right  Why are you mentioning that?  I haven't seen your act  In years man  Probably since the last time  We worked together  Me, him and Voss did Caroline  Five or six years ago  So I'm gonna probably  Go tonight or Sunday  I'm doing a lot of your stuff  Now  Is that it?  Yeah  It's working really well  There is something there  Where you take like  You know  Two comedians  That are very opposite  And throw them on one show 
[03:35:30]  Oh yeah  Yeah  I'm sure Brian's audience  Would just love  See the fact of the matter is  Jimmy's audience  Would absolutely  They'd love Brian  Love Brian  That's what I mean  I think there's a way  Of doing it  But there's too many people  In Brian's audience  That would be so offended  By little Jimmy  Oh I got you  Yeah  There are people  Remember we heard the stories  They got upset  When you said damn  Or something  You said a word like  I think he said shucks  Shucks  H-E double hockey sticks  And someone was like  You know your language 
[03:36:00]  No  There was a New Year's Eve show  He was doing  And someone said something  And he said  Shut up you have a face  Like a clit hood  Right  Yeah  Which is my normal  My normal comeback  Your normal response  I'll even say that  If someone orders a drink  Can I overhear it?  You know what I mean?  You know you got to  Put people in their place  Hey we didn't get  The transcripts  We were going to  Surprise you with something  Brian but I don't  Think it's going to happen  We didn't get it done  I don't even think  You would be willing  To do it  We were going to get  The transcripts  Of the Pat O'Brien  Sex tapes 
[03:36:30]  And have you read them  We're getting an  Instant feedback  Ramon's back  Completely didn't understand  The last Ramon  Open your veins thing  Alright good  Let's get Stephen here  Did he get bitten by a shark  Hopefully Ramon has AIDS  Oh my god  Donates his blood  Deep voice guy  They both get the flu  And wither away  Yeah we were listening  To the new Ramon promo  Going into break  And we had a whole discussion  During the break  Saying what?  I didn't even hear it  I was tinkling  Ramon's  Ramon open your veins  Cozy is starting to lose it  Okay you've got to explain 
[03:37:00]  The Ramon promo  I'm getting all these  What the fuck  Kind of new Ramon promo  Was that?  Ramon open your veins  I've read it  Ramon open your veins  The worst Ramon promo ever  I can go on  Mixed reviews  Steve  This can be the  Dick of the Ramon  Critics agree  And not only that  Let me add  On a personal level  The voice is different  Wait the whole part of it?  The whole thing  Or the end part?  Deep voice guy  The voice is different  It brought back  This flashback 
[03:37:30]  Of when all of a sudden  I turned on the Flintstones  And Fred's voice  Was different  And as a child  That traumatized  Because you know  You're used to Fred's voice  Right  I can't do the Fred voice  But everyone's familiar with it  But it's always a good thing  When you take a creative chance  Man  Not changing the voice  Because as a kid  I turned it on  And I heard Barney  You know  Hey Fred  We're going to work  And Fred was like  Yeah Barney  Get in the car  It's like what the  Who the  That's not Fred  That's not the Fred  I'm not used to this 
[03:38:00]  This is not what I'm used to  I had a feeling  I might have pitched it down  Just a little too much  It's so  I don't know what you did to it  But it wasn't that  And  It was  No one understood  What the setup was  I overthought it  I overthought it way too much  I want to hear the Ramon promo  I will play the Ramon promo  Let's hear it  So Steve can explain this  Brian's  You've got to  Set up the bit for Brian  The Ramon promos  Are based on the concept 
[03:38:30]  There's this eccentric  Deep voice guy  And he doesn't really  Leave his house  And he's catered to  His every whim is catered to  By a little  South American house boy  Named Ramon  And that's it  And Ramon takes care  Of menial tasks  All day long  This one was in the ocean  There was another one  On the highway  He doesn't leave his house  Much today  He happens to  All deep voice guy does  Is voice over work  Right  He gets paid very well  And he can do a lot of this  From his house  And he's very eccentric  And lets the little house boy  Do all of his menial tasks  I think it's based on  The most famous voice guy 
[03:39:00]  Right  It's based on  From the movie trailers  Yeah  Someone told me a story  That Don LaFontaine  The guy that does  All the movie trailers  And some network stuff  Really doesn't leave his house  He's got a studio in his house  And just bangs out  Voice stuff all day  In his smoking jacket  It makes a lot of money  Makes a lot of money  That was the same  With Earl Anthony  The professional bowler  He never left his home  He had a bowling lane  Down in the  Yeah he did all his bowling  Down in the basement  I like that kind of  I got an example  Of the guy  That this is based on  Alright  It was part of  Family Guys  The new episode 
[03:39:30]  That was last Sunday  In the year 33 AD  The Messiah  He's gone  Where did he go?  Hang on  Man you crazy Jesus  You crazy  That's what my ex-wife said  So the son of God  You sure are  Son of a  Whoa  Chris Tucker  And Jim 
[03:40:00]  Caviezel  Is that it?  The guy from the first one?  Passion of the Christ 2  Crucify this  You know how to use  One of these?  You know how to use  One of these?  This July  Let he  Who is without sin  Kick the first ass  That was a great take off 
[03:40:30]  On the movie trailer  Family guy  And that's the guy  And that's him  Yeah  That's him right?  Yeah  Alright so without further ado  Here's the brand new Ramon promo  That really doesn't make much sense  Yeah  Who doesn't love  A nice dip  In the tranquil  Blue ocean  Oh  That looks like  A dorsal fin  Carcharidon  Carcharious  If I'm not mistaken  One moment  Ramon 
[03:41:00]  Open your veins  Damn  Swing and a miss  Swing and a miss  That was a  Fucking  That was an Achilles pull  Well  Well  That was painful  Highbrow  Highbrow  Highbrow  The best part of these  Brian  He loves to explain them  So now here's the explanation  Here's the explanation 
[03:41:30]  Alright  He just happens to love  When he does leave his house  He does  Take a nice drive  In his Bentley  Or sometimes he'll go out  Into the ocean  Swimming in the ocean  The soft water keeps him very buoyant  Crazy person  And of course he's not going to go without Ramon  Well he happens to be  Swimming in the ocean  And he sees a dorsal fin  Well he's certainly not going to stick around for long  But at the same time he's rather humanitarian  And wants to make sure the shark comes for what he came for  Which was a nice meal  So he has to make sure that Ramon 
[03:42:00]  Oh is that  Wait  Wait  Wait  To protect himself  I thought it was to protect himself  It is  But he's also  He's not really thinking of Ramon's well being  But now he's going to have to get a new guy  Ramon seems to have survived everything else he's been put through  So I guess he's of the mind that  Ramon doesn't matter  There's a million other Ramones waiting to take over  Kind of like that room there  Like those guys are just  There's people waiting to step right in  Why are they giving me the finger?  Ramon's life hasn't been in danger before  I mean he's used Ramon's sleeve to wipe his ass 
[03:42:30]  Well he put out a cigar in Ramon's mouth once  That wasn't a lie  Brian  I don't want to put out a cigar in your mouth  This is going to be on the DVD as part of the extras  Ah man  So it was really  But I think the thought process was  We've set the bar so high  And like two of them have involved human feces at this point  Yeah  So you can only go to the shit barrel so many times  That's it  Before you know  And so we were trying to think  Well would Ramon ever put a grenade in his mouth?  Would Ramon ever eat a poisoned apple? 
[03:43:00]  Would Ramon ever do this?  So you know  Let's have Ramon get consumed by a shark  That one didn't work apparently  What was the official name for the shark?  Carcaridin carcarious  Exactly  It's a great white shark  I went and did research  I went and did research to find out what an eccentric  Were you watching Jaws?  No  I think they use that in Jaws  It's one of the lines in Jaws  It is actually  You're going to need a better line  Is that a type of shark?  It's a great white  Carcaridin carcarious is a great white  Ramon  Close the beaches
