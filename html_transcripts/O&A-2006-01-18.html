<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a celebratory mood, marking their move to XM Satellite Radio and launching "Whip Them Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging listeners to display "WOW" stickers on their cars to elicit responses from women.  Bill Burr is a guest in the studio throughout a significant portion of the broadcast.  The hosts discuss a New York Times crossword clue possibly referencing Opie.  A major topic is New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin's controversial "Chocolate City" remarks, with audio clips played and analyzed.  They discuss the post-Hurricane Katrina demographics and the Mayor's apparent efforts to maintain a predominantly Black population in the city. The tragic death of a young girl in a New York child abuse case and reactions to her funeral are also addressed.  American Idol is briefly discussed, focusing on Paula Abdul's appearance.  A knife-fighting class at Anthony's dojo is mentioned, and a Stephen Lynch song about his preference for Black women is played.

The show heavily features listener-submitted remixes of audio from Howard Stern's daughter, Emily Stern's nude scene in a play,  described with explicit sexual content and derogatory terms.  Opie, Anthony, and Bill Burr provide highly offensive commentary on these remixes. The show also includes graphic descriptions of a pre-op transsexual encountered in their office;  scathing commentary on Simon Cowell's judging style on the UK X-Factor;  discussion of Howard Stern's reaction to his daughter's performance and subsequent quitting the play; and mocking descriptions of bizarre American Idol auditions.

A significant portion of the show is dedicated to a vitriolic attack on Dave Rossi, a DJ from WAVF (96 Wave) in South Carolina,  who seemingly criticized Opie and Anthony.  The hosts and Bill Burr relentlessly mock Rossi's career, personal life, and on-air style using derogatory and insulting language.  Listener calls contribute to this verbal assault.  This attack extends to a broader mocking of the Storm and Kenny morning show on the same station, including ridicule of their promotional appearances (often involving chicken wings) and analysis of their promotional schedule.  They also discuss and mock Dave Rossiâ€™s use of pre-recorded intros falsely claiming to be from artists like Lane Staley, along with a dissection of a promotional photo of another DJ, Cindy Miller.  A caller, Beth, a former New Orleans DJ, engages in a discussion about her radio experiences and light-format radio. The hosts compare their satellite radio format to commercial radio slogans, further highlighting their disdain for the WAVF DJs.  Technical difficulties while attempting to play WAVF's audio lead to humorous commentary about their production staff, particularly E-Rock.  The segment includes listener calls detailing crude childhood games involving choking and other forms of physical harm, with the hosts sharing similar experiences;  a discussion of a deodorant ad for "Snatch"; and a brief interaction with Bob Kelly in the studio. The segment ultimately concludes without playing any of Dave Rossi's show.

A later segment features listener calls detailing more crude childhood games ("Open Neck," "Thailand," "Fish Hook").  A caller, Donahue, recounts a near-rehab experience related to Vicodin misuse after receiving a tip from Bob.  The hosts discuss Bob's deleted MySpace account, potentially due to an R. Kelly song posted in the comments.  A significant portion is dedicated to a "Coming or Going" game, where the hosts and Steve (a producer) attempt to distinguish between porn and horror movie clips. This game becomes highly competitive and contentious, punctuated by accusations of cheating and arguments over scoring, culminating in Anthony's victory.  The segment concludes with further discussion of the game and the titles of some of the movies used.

[00:12:30]  in New Brunswick  wow  there we go  bravo  thank you  very nice  covert plug  under the guise  of helping us out  a cheap plug  is thrown in  it's going to be  a good show  let's start off  nice right  I like your listeners  who likes the show  right now  loves the listeners  we're waiting for  some audio to come in  we got to get the  Mayor Nagin's  comment about  Chocolate City  well we played it  yesterday  well we did the original one  but now he's trying 
[00:13:00]  to explain himself  do we have the  original clip again  Gain and Onya  gotta find the original  Iraq  it uh  yeah yesterday  you gotta play that  Parliament song  underneath the speech  man  yeah it fits  well now he's trying  to explain what he meant  because it didn't look good  he was talking to a bunch  of black people  during MLK day  giving a speech  and he looks out  into a sea of black faces  and I guess he got  caught up in the moment  and didn't think  Whitey was there  or gonna like  look  cause some black people 
[00:13:30]  do that  black leaders do that  Farrakhan's done it  a few times  Jesse  they get caught up  in that moment  the sea of blackness  and they think  and these crackers  yeah  crackers  they let their black out  and then all of a sudden  the white reporters  call and go  what did you mean  when you said  cracker ass cracker  and then they say  well did you look  on the refreshment table  we had  saltines  yes some ritz  a variety  a melting pot  if you will  of crackers  and you know black people  we attach  the suffix 
[00:14:00]  ass  to a lot of stuff  right  broke ass  broke ass  I could use  some prime rib  ass prime rib  yes  right now  see that's how  I would speak  he tried so hard  he learned some slang  little slang  he got caught up  in the moment  is what happened  it was MLK day  yeah it's MLK day  you're talking  to all black people  all black  you were saying  this is a black city  right  black city  and I gotta admit  I've been there  and I would agree  to agree with this  it is  it's beyond black  it's a voodoo city  oh 
[00:14:30]  it is  watch your tongue  lest somebody  stick a pin  through a doll  of a bilber  and do what  make my life  any shittier  you'd welcome  a voodoo doll  I'm already on the mat  I mean what are you  what are you gonna do  I welcome a voodoo doll  prop my head up  off the floor  well I think  one of the problems  is some of the  statistics that are  coming in  in New Orleans  it seems a lot of  the people  had to evacuate  obviously we all  remember that  the hurricane Katrina 
[00:15:00]  and a lot of  the damaged areas  were in the black areas  now a lot of the  black people  aren't coming back  they're staying  where they relocated  and a lot of the  white people  are coming back  so it's kind of  changing the percentage  of black to white  in New Orleans  and he  is alarmed by that  wants it to remain  a predominantly  black city  because he wants  to stay in office  he wants to stay in office  oddly enough  he was a  he ran a  cable company  much like our own 
[00:15:30]  Hugh Pinero  back in the old days  and he's a novice  to politics  just got into it  in 2002  and was elected  because of the  white vote  a lot of white people  voted for this guy  so he's a little worried  about the next election  that what he said  kind of put off  his constituency  his opponent must have  been really dark  Jesus Christ  his opponent must have  been purple  who was it  what's his face  over there  from DC  years ago  what was his name  Mayor of Marion Barry 
[00:16:00]  who was caught  recently smoking  a little of  I don't know  something  are you kidding  again still  yeah he got caught  with something  very recently  don't you reach  an age where you  just say  maybe I shouldn't  do crack anymore  or you push through  to the other side  where you just  fucking kill  you're just over  yeah  you can't have  a political career  and  occasionally  be an occasional  an occasional politician  crack smoker  an occasional crack smoker  so he got  he's a little upset 
[00:16:30]  with the fact  that New Orleans  the demographic  could change  and there could be  more white people  than black people  so he says  it should stay  a chocolate city  yeah we got  the original thing  he said here finally  and then we got  what he's trying  to say now  and then what he  told a reporter  to try to  smooth this over  is re-goddamned  ridiculous  he just made it  much worse  but here's the  original thing  the mayor of New Orleans  said  as we think about  rebuilding New Orleans 
[00:17:00]  surely God is mad  at America  he's sending  hurricane after  hurricane after  hurricane  and is destroying  and putting stress  on this country  surely he's not  approval  of us being  in Iraq  under false  pretenses  but surely  he is upset  at black America  also  we're not taking 
[00:17:30]  care of ourselves  we're not taking  care of our women  and we're not taking  care of our children  when you have  a community  where 70%  of his children  are being born  to one parent  we as black people  it's time  it's time for us  to come together  it's time for us  to rebuild  a New Orleans  the one that should be  a chocolate New Orleans 
[00:18:00]  and I don't care  what people are saying  uptown  or wherever they are  this city  will be chocolate  at the end of the day  clap over  this city  will be a majority  African American city  right there  it's the way  God wants it to be  really  you can't have  New Orleans  no other way  it wouldn't be  New Orleans  he turned his black 
[00:18:30]  way up for that speech  that is not the way  he talked to George Bush  that is not the way  he was talking  to the governor  that's not how he got  the white vote  that is not how he got  the white vote  on his campaign ads  it wasn't like  this by the end of the day  will be a chocolate city  oh that's the guy  I want to vote for  my word  this is the man  I want representing me  and he said  he doesn't care  what they think  uptown  this will be  an African American  city  and there's no  chocolate 
[00:19:00]  it cannot be  he can't make excuses  as to why he said that  because he then said  African American  we know what he meant  he better be careful  yeah  we know what he meant  you need crackers  in a city  of course  it's  cracker  must be in the inner city  at some point  you do need us  yeah  yeah  well  what a reporter  got a hold of him now  so now a reporter  cracker  reporter  comes up to him 
[00:19:30]  and asked him  what he meant  by chocolate city  yeah  and his  his comeback to this  probably one of the most  ridiculous excuses  I've heard  a politician  utter  alright check it out  let's talk about  the comments  that you made  about  being a chocolate city  and how God  wants it that way  do you think that's a bit divisive though  on MLK Day  do you know anything about chocolate  I'm asking you  I'm asking you  do you know anything about chocolate 
[00:20:00]  how do you make chocolate  you take dark chocolate  you mix it with white milk  and it becomes  a delicious drink  that's the chocolate  I'm talking about  the mayor says  his comments  refer to a racially diverse city  made up of many  different kinds of people  New Orleans was a chocolate city  before Katrina  it's gonna be a chocolate city  after  how is that divisive  it's white and black  working together  coming together  and making something special  we are gonna have 
[00:20:30]  a milk  white city  nice backstroke  and then the next day  be like  you ever see where milk  comes from  you ever seen a black cow  well that's what I'm talking about  that's right  you ever hear  what I'm talking about  you ever hear the term  cow now brown cow  yes  brown cow  gives us the white milk  what I mean is  exactly  I don't think I could have been  any clearer  with that example  you know how they make chocolate  I'm asking you  do you know how  and sometimes  there is that 
[00:21:00]  I love it  the crackle  you ever have a Hershey crackle  it's got rice in it  we want the goddamn  Oriental's in here too  we gonna have  a yellow city  yellow city  from here on out  now let's say  I'm talking  almond joy  now we got a peanut  which represents  the south  and coconut  which I guess  some Hawaiians  will move in  or some shit  but  the candy man 
[00:21:30]  the candy man  kind  who can fix  knowledge  and makes the world  taste good  I want  the construction firms  to make two by fours  out of milk chocolate  I meant it literally  a chocolate city  I want the wall boards  to be Hershey bars  you know who owns Hershey  the company  white people  white people  who's gonna provide 
[00:22:00]  all the chocolate  white people  who's been holding us down  I mean  who's gonna  somebody called Charlie  Charlie and the chocolate factory  Charlie and the chocolate factory  will make the  equipment we need  to rebuild knowledge  I want the levees  made out of  stacked up Hershey kisses  wouldn't that be beautiful  and if it floods again  the people will have  something to eat  while they wait  for the helicopter  they'll have a delicious  delicious meal  I want all the roofs  made out of 
[00:22:30]  milk chocolate  that way no one  needs an axe  you could deliciously  eat your way  through the roof  and stand there  waiting for the helicopter  Hershey bars for the roofs  they lay out nice  they lay out like shingles  I am now contacting Hershey  for the Hershey shingle  you know what I do like  I like when a reporter  asks somebody a question  and then they actually  will fire a question  back at him  and you just hear the reporter  like dares in the  eyes and the headlights 
[00:23:00]  doesn't even know  how to respond  no  he's like  well  do you know what's in  you know what  you ever had chocolate  because you know what chocolate  I'm asking you  and then he's sitting there  going  have I ever fucked  a black girl  it's like  what does he mean by that  well Texas is very interested  in what the mayor  has to say  we got Bob  oh we just lost  Bob from Texas  oh no  he wanted to basically  tell the mayor  of New Orleans  to get all  all his chocolate  people out of Texas  oh is he upset  with the chocolate  export  to Texas  yes he is  New Orleans has been  their number one 
[00:23:30]  export  chocolate  a little known fact  Texas doesn't like  chocolate  no  Texas is much more  of a vanilla state  yeah  for some reason  I think that they're  going to make a lot  of donations  to that  chocolate city  anyway  here's uh  we gotta gather up  all the chocolate  and send it  to New Orleans  we gotta get that  chocolate back  to New Orleans  here's the mayor  apologizing  for what he had to say  about the chocolate city  thing  alright  and I said some things  that were totally 
[00:24:00]  inappropriate  and I need to be  more sensitive  and more aware  of what I'm saying  and I want everybody  to be welcome  in New Orleans  black  white  Hispanic  Asian  everyone  black  everyone  everyone  when are people  gonna realize  this guy's a kook  he lost his mind  he was a little  crazy beforehand  but that city  is a little crazy  right  so he kind of  fits in  you know  it's one of those  cities that probably  run themselves  you know  the mayor's 
[00:24:30]  kind of that  figurehead  he's on the floor  that's one of the scariest  cities other than Detroit  I've ever been to  frightening  yeah  my feeling  anytime I went there  when you're on Bourbon Street  you're like  as long as I stay  on this street  with all these people  I'm in the herd  but if I go  five feet this way  or that way  I'm gonna have  like a fucking  chicken foot  in my neck  chicken claw  you're that zebra  that went off  to stay at the water  hole a little too long  you just wait  in the bushes  that's totally the vibe  you just stay in there  show your tits  stay in the herd  you'll be fine 
[00:25:00]  I so agree with you  I think the mayor's  just looking for another hit  he got all that attention  when Katrina came through  yes he did  he got all the cameras  in his face  he liked that attention  he liked it  he liked it  and now he's just  trying to keep that going  I don't think  this is a good way  to keep it going  I think during election time  I don't know when he's up  for the election  2002  what are they  got six year terms  over there  who knows  so he's probably  I like hearing 
[00:25:30]  speeches like that  from black people  because it's like  you're just like us  we give a shit  about your own people  your own peeps  it's natural  and he's had  some valid points  about the black community  in New Orleans  you know  there's a lot of people  having children  being raised by  the moms  or grandmoms  70%  a lot of violence  a lot of black on black crime  70%  you say the moms  the moms  blacking it up  trying to blacken it off  there you go  that's how he said it 
[00:26:00]  the moms  the moms  we have one more clip here  I guess it's  women on street react  let's listen to this  and I feel like  what he said  was very self-serving  I think it serves  his own purposes  but it  you know  it doesn't do anything  to help us  others appreciated  the candor  and I think  that that was his way  not  I don't know  if it was the best way  but that was  I think  that was his way  of letting  everyone know  that  the city  is not going  to abandon 
[00:26:30]  the black population  yeah but the black population  is abandoning you  yeah  they don't want  to be there  and  here  I need some footnotes  as Patrice says  some footnotes  added to this  alright  it is not  really  I don't think  the  the cogs  the machine  that makes  New Orleans work  I don't think  those are the people  that really  aren't  coming back  I think  it's a lot 
[00:27:00]  of the  displaced  impoverished  people  probably can't afford  to society  in New Orleans  and I think  the city  is probably  better off  if those  people that  perhaps  weren't contributing  regardless  of their race  Phil  he walks  a fine  fucking line  that perhaps  it is better  for the city  if those  people  stay  away from  New Orleans  and it  would be  easier  for New Orleans  to rebuild  Anthony walks 
[00:27:30]  a tightrope  this is the exact  opposite speech  right between  two skyscrapers  you're going to have a reporter  coming up to you  the next day  so what did you mean  by that  what did you mean  by asking me  the question  I'm asking you  the question  but see here's the  difference  reporters can't  find him  no one can  find him  oh that's right  he's isolated  that's right  that's why  he can say  what he said  hey a lot of  people in  New Orleans  we're getting  info here  let's go to  this guy  in New Orleans  there's no  name here  alright  guy with no  name  from New Orleans  what's up 
[00:28:00]  hey how you guys  doing  hey  the ultimate  truth is  it's not  the chocolate  New Orleans  that's being  rebuilt  it's the  Mexican  New Orleans  why  there's more  I'm sorry  more Mexicans  down there  they've  you know  you'll see  more Mexicans  labor right now  in New Orleans  than you will  really of any  other class  Mexicans  they work hard  they work cheap  their accommodations  which they require  are pretty light 
[00:28:30]  they really don't  require a lot  the office I work in  we've got four of them  living upstairs  wow  okay  Mexicans in New Orleans  who knew  there you have it  thank you sir  that's funny  they really don't  require a lot  isn't that  complete lack  of a negotiation  position  yeah  absolutely  I would like  better quarters  I'm going to  call immigration  alright this is  nice  this works  this works  for me  we could share  six  we could have  six in a bed  no problem  these Mexicans  are real easy going  good observation 
[00:29:00]  Bill  I want New Orleans  to be Taco City  alright so that's  you're going to be  seeing bigger hats  that's an ongoing story  talking to ones  that lean to the side  he's one of our  faves  that mayor down there  and how he speaks  something I wanted  to bring to the show  today  there was this  horrific thing  that happened  to this girl  here in New York  City  will she get  justice  the parents  you know  another one of  these child abuse 
[00:29:30]  cases  every so often  this happens  if a little kid  slips through the  cracks of the  government agencies  that are put in  place to protect  them  and even though  they've been  checked on  and complained about  and social services  goes over  and checks it out  something happens  and they wind up  getting beaten to death  yeah and the parents  were living  once in a while  two monsters  fuck  yeah  and they have a child  is that what it is  yes  two monsters  yes  I don't know how  the fuck you could  do something 
[00:30:00]  yeah  it's amazing  the parents were  living very very well  and this kid was  just tied to chairs  and how old is  and she had a poop  in like a cat box  and just dunking her  in like ice cold  bath water  freezing cold water  and then smacking her  around  yeah  I mean  the Al-Qaeda's  getting treated  better than that  I know  like that  yeah  hostages  how old was  this girl  because she looks  like she's  in her 30s  about 7 or 8 years old  she looks like  she's in her 30s  oh fuck man  if you're going to be  pooping in a cat box 
[00:30:30]  and getting your  face dunked in ice water  you're going to age  real fast  I know  that's just it  it's like she  aged so quickly  like progeria  by proxy  they beat progeria  into her  and there'll be  somebody defending  this couple  and you know  and there'll still  be people out there  that don't get  the death penalty  and whatever  yeah  the woman will  get out of it  huh  the woman always  gets out  she'll say  she had  I was scared  I didn't know  what was going on  I had an inability  to make a phone call 
[00:31:00]  I'm just a girl  you're so right  that's what happened  all the time  this fucking girl  stay with mob  husbands  they know what  the fuck he's doing  he's out there  murdering people  and they're wearing  the furs  and the FBI shows up  I thought he worked  at a bakery  I didn't know  what was going on  I thought people  really loved his donuts  remember Hedda Nussbaum  she was the one  with Joel Steinberg  they were a couple  of monsters  and killed 
[00:31:30]  their little child  years ago  and she said  just that  I was abused  I couldn't make  a phone call  and she knew  everything that was  going on  totally  and she was  beaten  she looked like  fucking  like Jake LaMotta  yeah  just her nose  was on the side  of her face  big cauliflower ears  her eyes were all  like scarred up  who the kid was  no the  the wife  of this Joel Steinberg  guy  this guy was just  an angry man  beat the shit  out of her  and the kid 
[00:32:00]  and this is  pretty much  the highest  profile  one of these  we've seen  since then  yeah  so  what I want  to bring  to the attention  of the show  today  so they had  the funeral  and a lot  of people  that had  no idea  who this  girl was  went to  the funeral  right  so they're  interviewing  these people  on TV  this morning  and some  mom  I mean  I'm not a  parent  but I can't  imagine how  this is a good  thing to do  to your child  some mom  brings her  little kid 
[00:32:30]  to the funeral  and then  the news  now is  and the kid  didn't even  know the other  kid  no  had no  clue  no connection  it was just  like a lot  of people  feel like  they need  to go to  this wake  so they're  going there  you know  to support  the child  whatever  so the mom  brings this  little kid  to the wake  and the little  kid is horrified  and now the  news is interviewing  this little girl  that can't be  much older  than this girl  maybe  actually I think  she's younger  she's got to be  like six or seven  just crying her eyes  out on the news  child abuse  and I'm thinking  what parent 
[00:33:00]  would bring  their little kid  to a funeral  like this  complete child  abuse  bringing this  kid  why would you  subject your  child to that  type of sorrow  when you really  don't need to  especially  when you don't  have any  connection to  this kid  whatsoever  images that  are going to  stick in  this kid's  head  especially  if you want  your kid  to have a  childhood  yeah  yeah  you know  maybe not  have to look  at the horrors  the horrors  of a beating  death of a child  that you know  look at this  it is a horrible 
[00:33:30]  horrible thing  but the truth of  the matter is  it doesn't happen  every day  kids get abused  I'm not saying  that or making  light of it  or anything  but you don't  this isn't something  you've got to  show your kid  because it's  happening all  around you  on a daily  basis  and you have to  train them  to get used  to it  right  this is going  to score  a nightmare  this is going  to score a kid  you know  and the next time  this kid  is playing  playstation  the mom goes  you know  turn off the game  and do  your school  work  I think  this kid 
[00:34:00]  is going  to listen  puts the kid  in the high  chair  and puts  that tray  in front  of it  remember  miss mary  do you remember  what she looked  like laying  in her coffin  okay  clean up  your room  now  clean up  your room  clean up  your room  you're a perfect  kid now  I guess  maybe the mom  was on to  something  I don't  want  to be  beaten  to death  clean your room  and you won't  be beaten  to death  mommy don't 
[00:34:30]  beat me  and hold me  under the water  well  we can't even  do this justice  here's the clip  man  little kid  visiting wake  crying her face  off  has no connection  to this little  girl  the wakes for  little mix  mary  are any indication  of how her  funeral will be  hundreds of  people are  expected here  at st. mary's church  for the services  at 9 a.m.  while the child's  mother and stepfather  sit in jail  indicted by a grand jury  people old and young  are mourning  the death of the child 
[00:35:00]  I wanted to come see her  because her story  touched me  and I felt so bad  that wasn't right  for what her father did  young children  overcome with emotion  made up some of  the hundreds of mourners  paying their final  respects to  seven-year-old  nix muddy brown  it's a tragedy  it's something  that shouldn't  happen to her  because she had  her whole life  ahead of her  holy shit  are you kidding me  that's a little

[00:43:00]  it's the American Idol  I'm like yeah I took a peek  but there were no celebrities involved  I'm all about celebriality  you gotta get off the celebrities  every so often  and the judges  come on  VH1 has come up with that term  seeing how many drugs she's done  no she's got  she's got  she's clear eyed this year unfortunately  so it's not as much fun  they told her  they must have told her  look  it's not as much fun  you can tell that she's clean and sober  she was slurring  and she was all like  I think you're one of the best  singers in the performance

[00:52:00]  in  yeah  if you really  want to  protect us  how about  you beat up  the air  conditioning  guy  whoever decides  that the air  conditioning  needs to be  on at 6  in the morning  there should be  a meat locker  in here  in the morning  Bill  arrived  and Anthony  was in a  massive  winter coat  preparing for  the radio show  I like Everest  climbing gear  I thought you  just got here  yeah  yeah  it's a heavy  heavy jacket  because it's  three hoodies  underneath  yeah  three hoodies  very good 
[00:52:30]  Paul  yeah we'll take  care of the  air conditioning  guy if you want  how's the dojo  fantastic  very good  congrats on that  we're on the  seventh week  and we have  about 80 students  80 people  learning how  to kill  people with  sticks  and rubber  bands  knives  knives  you actually  have knife  fighting  classes  oh yes  yeah  full contact  full contact  knife fight  so are you  throwing dead  bodies out  the back door  well we don't  want to do that  because then  we'll lose our  student count  you know what  you did wrong  in that little  encounter  take this piece 
[00:53:00]  of crap  out back  yeah  that's his  kidney  bag him  and tag him  gentlemen  no we use  rubber knives  so no one  no one gets  hurt  rubber knives  and it's all  like you know  if somebody  attacks you  from the front  or from the  back  and you'll  pretty much  train them  on how to  kick some  ass with a  knife  exactly  you go  one against  one  you go  two against  one  three against  one  four against  one  three guys  with knives  against one  guy  and you  have kind  of a shot  knife  yeah  ten against  one  ten against 
[00:53:30]  one  in real life  we're talking  ten against  one  ten guys  come at you  is this one of  those attacks  like in the karate  movies where  everybody waits  their turn  one at a time  to watch their  buddy get their  ass handed to  him and then  the next guy  comes in  wow  you're like  number eight  going huh  I don't know  about this  oh god  I hope someone  kills him  before I gotta  go in  stupid people  why wouldn't  they all go  on one  just all at  once  all at once  pound of  ten on one  no there's no  waiting  if you really  know how to  use a knife 
[00:54:00]  and we're  talking about  people that  have no idea  what the knife  is all about  and the strengths  then you can  defend yourself  I'm thinking  is it some  kind of  maybe backhanded  grip and you  gotta spin  and take out  as many of  them coming  at you at  once  well you  use the  upper part  of the  knife  the tip  because that's  your longest  weapon  further away  exactly  you can turn  around  that's an  ice pick  grip  that's for  inside fighting  but the  main grip  is the  saber grip  just like  fencing 
[00:54:30]  right  so you're  holding the  knife  ten guys  charge you  who do you  take out  first  well you  cut the  nearest thing  that is  in front  of you  like a  hand  so the  closest  thing  that you  win  that gets  cut  exactly  the hand  the head  if somebody  kicks you  you cut  the ankle  if someone  throws a  punch  you cut  the wrist  or the  fist  homeland  security  isn't  checking  you  out  or  anything  but if  ten guys  are surrounding  you  and they all  jump on you 
[00:55:00]  well once again  this isn't  you know  we're not  talking about  a Bruce Lee  movie  you want to  try to keep  something behind  you like a  wall  and anytime  somebody comes  towards you  you have to  be able to  hit as  quickly as  you can  if someone  if you really  don't know  how to use  a knife  and someone  is skilled  in using a  knife  then what  can happen  is you  will disable  every single  person there  so you're  talking about  ten guys  attack you  and you're  the only  one with  a knife  no  they could  have  knives  too  and they  gotta have  down  syndrome  too  wow 
[00:55:30]  I guess  it's not  a guarantee  that you're  gonna come  out of this  nothing's  guaranteed  but you  you are  teaching  to give  you the  best possible  chance  of getting  out of  that situation  right  and then  when you  have  ten people  that are  trained  and one  person  that's  trained  your  skill  just  reaches  another  level  now you're  talking about  when you go  on the street  most of these  people will use  the west side  story technique  where they throw  the knife  from side 
[00:56:00]  to side  do people  still do that  and do they  sing and dance  during it  because that  I think  would be a  detriment  to your  assault  if you're  going  or maybe  they think  you're  crazy  that could  help  then  okay  you start  singing  any song  and dance  down at the  dojo  yeah  no  they think  you're a  former  broadway  singer  you just  tell them  they fired  me  because I  have AIDS  come on  who wants  some  scatter  who wants  some  people  I got  a knife  and I'm  cut  riff  is this 
[00:56:30]  the music  you play  down at the  dojo  during the  knife fight  oh yeah  are you kidding  I don't want  her going  out with  no  fucking  because  every  porter  rick  is a  lousy  chicken  here  come  the  jets  like  no  you're  going to  do that  alright  now  throw  the  knife  now  do  a  pirouette  alright  now  on your  knees  now  all the  guys  behind  you  with  knives  you  gotta  be  choreographed  fossey  hands  fossey  hands  fossey  hands  grab  your  knife  well

[00:58:00]  in  the  ones  he  thinks  are  okay  for  the  show  and then  I  try  to  go  through  Frankie  Blue  and then  I  try  to  go  through  the  ones  he  hands  in  and  then  finally  we  get  them  on  the  60  came  in  easily  there  had  to  be  some  really  just  bad  you  know  after  listening  to  60  you  have  no  barometer  anymore  you're

[00:59:00]  got  a  nose  job  rob  anyway  so  really  here's  the  question  I  asked  today  what  do  we  do  do  we  try  them  out  live  on  the  show  because  there's  going  to be  some  crap  look  we  can  American  Idol  style  like  I  watched  last  night  some  people  came  in  and  sang  one  line  the  Statue  of  Liberty  guy  favorite  guy  of 
[00:59:30]  the  night  this  guy  comes  in  and  I  don't  know  what  show  he's  been  watching  over  the  past  few  years  but  obviously  it  wasn't  American  Idol  gimmicks  don't  work  they  don't  work  they  instantly  look  at  you  like  alright  next  so  this  guy  is  from  New  York  this  gay  man  of  course  every  guy  it  seems  is  gay  that  comes  in  to  audition  I  think  he's  just  a  freak  yeah  that's  a whole  part  of it  he seemed  very effeminate  look at me  just derailing  your story  you're either  gay or  black  that's  it  yeah  yeah  well there's 
[01:00:00]  plenty of  gay black  guys on  that show  too  he comes  in dressed  as the  Statue  of  Liberty  and he  walks  in  he's  got  this  big  smile  on  his  face  and  says  his  name  and he  goes  I'm  from  New York  like  with a  big smile  like  that's  why  I'm  dressed  like  this  and he  breaks  into  what song  was it  New York  New York  or  Star  Spreading  the news  okay  thank you  thank you  and his  face  just like  went  to sorrow  and he  couldn't  understand  why it  was over  for him  thank you 
[01:00:30]  I think  he got  halfway  through  spreading  start  spread  thank you  thank you  and he's  sitting there  with his  fucking  hands still  up  like the  Statue  Liberty  got a  torch  in his  hand  gone  bye  thank you  I like  the  guy  well I  don't  like him  but  the  guy  that  was  dressed  like  the  Swiss  Miss  girl  oh  what a  freak  yeah  guy  comes in  hairy  legs  he's got  pigtails  in a  dress  what the  fuck  what is  he  thinking  I don't 
[01:01:00]  know  and  Simon  really  just  doesn't  care  anymore  it's  great  that  he's  really  laying  into  people  and he's  done that  the whole  time the  show's  been on  but I  mean now  more than  ever  even marginal  people he's  just telling  no you have  no talent  you shouldn't  be here  always wear a  tight shirt so  we can see his  man tits underneath  it  he does  well  well he's not  taking a break  he's also  doing the  x-factor  in the  UK  which is  basically  the British  version of  American Idol  so he's  uber bitter 
[01:01:30]  right now  he's looking  at crap  and doesn't  you know  so he's  had it  yeah  exactly  good  speaking of  man boobs  what was  going on  on pal  talk  during the  break  sexy  apparently  there's  some guy  who's  taking  hormone  treatment  before his  sex change  operation  is he  a fan  of the  show  or did  he just  sneak  into the  room  he's  in the  room  I don't  know  how  we find  him  yes pal  talk  the room  is  opium  anthony  live  and  people  come in  and this  guy was  in there 
[01:02:00]  and he's  got  he's  pre-op  transsexual  and I  guess he's  taking the  hormones  he's got  tits  under his  t-shirt  and he  had no  pants on  or underwear  no underwear  and his  dick was  the size  of the  first knuckle  on your  pinky  and he's  touching it  and twirling  it  and proud  of it  and long  blonde hair  too  yeah  well  he's trying  to keep  all the  sexy parts  out  long blonde  hair  well  all we saw  in the office  was the

[01:03:00]  parenting  and yelled  and screamed  and screamed  at her  and told  her  to quit  the show  basically  that's  exactly  what  happened  yeah  don't  think  there was  some  falling out  with the  director  no  so the  listeners  are  taking the  audio  the little  audio  that we do  have  I think  we only  have  like three  minutes  of it  it's up  on opianthony.com  and they're  making remixes  yes they are  and we haven't  heard these yet  so this could  either be a  complete disaster  or a lot of  fun  we'll see  what happens  the second  one of them  turns bad

[01:29:30]  with the hairiest arms  like gorilla hairy arms  and then on her shoulders  were just these stretch marks  just how do people  how do people  look at themselves and go  american idol  i am american idol material  stretch marks from carrying  all those pots of coffee  at the i-hop  big biceps and stretch marks  and hairy arms  yeah and how do they just look and go

[01:30:30]  it's great to watch  blue moon  he saw me standing alone  without a love of my own  oh  sorry  When will my reflection show who I am inside?  Blue moon.  Pull it. 
[01:31:00]  Pull it.  Oh my God.  She could have blew Simon and she wouldn't have gotten in.  I don't think he swings that way.  No?  You think he's gay?  Yeah.  You know what I notice about gay guys?  No matter what shape they're in, they wear tight shirts.  Oh.  Let's look around.  Who's got the tight shirts around here?  Oh, wow.  Shiny tight shirts.  I don't want to get Steve on.  Shiny tight shirts.  Oh, okay.  He has been connected romantically.  They've got the man tits and they're still wearing that.  I work in a hair salon shirt. 
[01:31:30]  And they're usually with some 18-year-old kid, like they're teaching them how to be gay.  Like, this is okay.  This is how you do it.  He's been linked to a lot of hot chicks and stuff.  I'm sure he has.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  I'm not trying to make excuses for him there.  I don't know.  That's just one of those things I look at and I'm like, dude, get the fuck out of here.  And it's so hard to make a gay man argument while you're eating a banana.  Yeah.  That was a little weird, actually.  I noticed you broke it into pieces, though. 
[01:32:00]  It's supposed to be deep-throaning.  Yeah.  Like, Jimmy.  You haven't known.  Right.  Nothing beats Jimmy eating bananas here on the show.  If you notice that he's eating a banana, he will take it, deep-throat it, and put his own hand on the back of his head and push down on his head.  The guy's like an idiot.  I love him.  All right.  Oh, this was great.  This guy sang his heart out and then Simon pretty much told him to shave and be a woman or something. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  The guy, again, obviously a gay gentleman.  Having a little bit of trouble with his song.  He sounds weird.  He's got a weird voice.  And Simon let him know.  I went to two auditions last year and the judges gave me some ideas and some tips that I should do and that I should follow.  And I followed their instructions this time and I think I'd want to make it to Hollywood.  The American Idol is just what I want to be. 
[01:33:00]  To have a voice to sing a song that reaches deep to the sea.  You can't say no.  I will not go.  There's a song I have to sing.  The American Idol is just what I want to be.  It doesn't get any worse than that, Charles.  Paula will hate me for saying this but I don't mean this disrespectfully.  You know what my advice to you would be? 
[01:33:30]  Honestly, shave off the beard and wear a dress.  Why?  Because he'd be a great female impersonator.  What are you trying to say, Simon?  You are trying to say that he should be a woman.  No worse than telling someone to be a rat.  You're an ass.  You're an ass.  You're an ass.  You're an ass.  You're an ass.  I'm saying he's a fucking faggot.  Okay?  Right.  Like just, he was being as blunt as he could right there. 
[01:34:00]  The guy was gay.  He could've been a female impersonator.  I'm just sick already of the fake tension between Paula Abdul and Simon.  Yeah.  Like she's supposed to be like the real nice one and stick up for these kids and it's just  so fake to me.  Yeah.  up into the it started authentic where she kept saying last night you're a pill you're a pill  you're a pill pill well what does that mean it means that was on her mind all night all right  please i need a pill i need a pill but that fake tension it's like i'm not buying into that sorry 
[01:34:30]  nope uh all right and then uh american idol will end with this ended with a surprise a guy that  was completely out of his fucking mind this makes no sense are they trying some new gimmick  i don't know let's not give it away until the end i guess but uh the guy says he talks with animals  this is how he he introduced himself i understand that you um talk with the animals or they talk  with you uh when i was 16 animals started talking to me in like in english yeah it was kind of a 
[01:35:00]  cartoonish voice let's say but like with verbs and pronouns and nouns and everything oh yeah  clear as dead hello hello whoa i'm here whoa yeah he's barefoot and just like jumping up and down  yeah crazy and then he sings something that i can't define this is only something that i can't be called 
[01:35:30]  enough of this just one more kiss and i will do anything you want me to  okay catchy yeah oh my gosh feel it feel it whoa you just keep moving now  whoa keep going keep going do it do it work it out work it out wow yeah hey yeah i feel it 
[01:36:00]  yeah yeah so then uh they basically make a monkey out they just they encourage him to jump up and  down and make a complete ass of himself but then they got caught up in it except for simon paul and  what's the other guy's name uh randy oh randy okay yeah they get caught up into this craziness that  this guy has amended there's a surprise and here it is okay randy is on that uh... i don't know you  know i'm kind of on the fence with this one i don't know yes because they's going to talk to the animals 
[01:36:30]  for me yeah yeah you promise yes oh yeah yes i say yes yes yes one down yes one down dave i am going to say  categorically never okay so your fate lies in paula's hands  yes yes yes yes yes yeah yeah i'm feeling feeling yes feeling yes oh so for my own reasons yes 
[01:37:00]  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 
[01:37:30]  Are you completely insane?  Why?  Like, is he going to be crazy guy through the whole thing?  Because I'm thinking this way.  Just the next round, then they get rid of him.  They're just having some fun.  I'm thinking.  That guy shouldn't be in it, but what the hell?  But you know what I noticed Simon does?  Because you know you're saying that attention's phony.  I think it bugs him that Paula will never say no. 
[01:38:00]  So he tries to get it where it's her decision.  Yeah, to make it her decision, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I've never said it a couple of times.  Yeah, Randy will say yes, and then Simon says no, and they need two out of three.  So he goes, well, it's up to you.  And now Paula's put in the position.  She hates that.  To crush the dream, which she doesn't like to do.  She just can't do that to anyone, right?  Uh-uh.  She's not helping these people because they stink.  They stink.  They're just going to get their dream.  Now their hopes are up another notch.  No, that guy has no hopes. 
[01:38:30]  He's just a goofball.  But I don't think he's actually sitting there thinking he could actually be a...  I think he's more sane than most of the other ones that they kicked off.  I think it's...  And they were delusional going, well, I don't understand.  Complete gimmick.  They know that the freak factor, like you said, the freak factor's over after the initial auditions.  And then they go into the Hollywood part of it, and that's where they lose you.  And a lot of other people, I guess, punch out of the show.  So now they have this freak guy. 
[01:39:00]  So if you're into that whole part of it, it gets a little more mileage out of it.  You're onto something, because now I'll have to take a peek until that guy gets kicked out.  And they're not done by far with the auditions, the initial auditions.  I bet they let a few more of these nut jobs in, so that that freak factor is there for the Hollywood segment.  For another week or two, right?  Yeah, man.  That guy's horrendous.  Yeah.  That's what'll happen.  Made me laugh really hard, that guy.  That guy was a complete fool.  What happened to the cop?  You guys didn't have that one?  Oh, the cop was great. 
[01:39:30]  I shot the sheriff.  Yeah, we don't have that one.  I did not shoot the deputy.  I shot the sheriff.  And they just let him keep going and going and going.  He wouldn't stop.  Yeah, maybe we could get that.  It was really bad.  You just know he went back to the station house, and they just like...  Oh, just killed him.  They just pounded him.  Oh, yeah.  Just killed him.  You know, it's like over the car radios.  I shot the sheriff.  They're playing tapes of his performance. 
[01:40:00]  And he's like going, all right, all right.  Asshole.  At least I fucking tried.  At least I had the courage to try.  I shot the sheriff.  Shut up.  Forty years from now, that's all you're going to have to sing to him.  You'll immediately get into a fight with him.  Yeah.  All that angry cop energy.  All right.  We're going to try to find that audio.  We're going to take a break, and we'll continue in just a bit here with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Bill Burr in studio. 
[01:40:30]  Bill, you're promoting...  Oh, my God.  Stress Factory?  Stress Factory.  27th and 28th of January.  And the 1st through the 5th.  I'm at Zaney's in Chicago.  Very nice.  Okay.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Bill Burr, everyone. 
[01:41:00]  This is Satellite Radio.  You have to pay for this shit.  That's right.  That's my goddamn slogan.  Everyone trying to come up with slogans lately.  That means everybody's switching.  Huh?  That means everybody's switching.  What do you mean?  I'm just saying the FBI, the FM guys, they didn't give a fuck.  Even like a month ago, they didn't even have this ad campaign. 
[01:41:30]  No.  Well, they were taking commercials for a while.  Yeah, we started this yesterday.  They're talking to all the bigwigs in regular radio.  Yeah.  To come up with slogans for commercial radio.  And they're just god-awful.  We got into this yesterday and then ran out of show, I guess, right?  And I don't know, because Satellite Radio is getting a lot of attention.  There's articles about it every single day in every paper in America, pretty much.  It's just blowing up.  And now commercial radio is scared. 
[01:42:00]  How's that blueberry Pop-Tart?  It's excellent.  Excellent.  The Pop-Tarts are excellent this morning.  That's what's great about Satellite.  It's either listen to me eat a Pop-Tart or listen to some car commercial.  See?  Listen to Satellite Radio, okay?  You can pay to hear someone eat.  Anyway, FM2B, one of the radio rag magazines and websites, they put the word out and they're collecting slogans for commercial radio. 
[01:42:30]  They're a scream, I got to tell you.  These are god-awful.  And Bill pointed it out yesterday, because Bill, obviously, a comedian, so he's looking at these things, trying to see if anyone out there is being sarcastic and having fun with this little thing they're doing.  And you really couldn't find any, right?  Yeah.  Bill?  I think there's like 50 here.  And I think one or two guys weren't just total, like, the company men. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  Yeah, because they're all awful.  They're coming up with slogans.  And I know these guys.  I don't know them personally, but I just know how they think.  And here's their opportunity to get their name in print in FMQB, so they're all excited.  And they probably tried out five or six of these on their friends.  And then they go, oh, this is the one I'm going to email over, man.  This is the one that will get my name in print.  And they're just stupid.  Like Bobby Sato from KCXX, his slogan for commercial radio, it's free, and that is a good price. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  We thought all day and sent that in.  John Perrone, TVT, whatever that is, listen to us or we'll fucking kill you.  That's not bad.  That's pretty good.  It's not bad if he means it.  Like, if he seriously is homicidal and will go out and kill people. 
[01:44:00]  That I'd like to see.  Obviously, it's not regular radio, though, because what's TVT?  I guess that's important there.  That's why he was able to get a little more saucy.  Oh, saucy.  He was able to get saucy, because it wasn't commercial radio.  And Dave Rossi from WAVF, he's just a scream.  Here's the one that pokes fun at us, Anthony.  Oh.  Hey, did you hear what Opie and Anthony did on the radio today?  Nobody did.  Satellite radio. 
[01:44:30]  It's awesome.  Oh, I get it.  I get it, because no one's listening?  Yeah.  That joke might have been relevant a couple of years ago.  Hey, did you hear what Dave Rossi said?  Who?  We got some guy that's doing a dumb show in, what, South Carolina in one little city, trying  to say that no one's listening to Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, no one's listening to us. 
[01:45:00]  At least when no one's listening to us, our signal is from the East Coast all the way to  the West Coast.  Sea to shining sea.  All the way up into Canada.  And I hear even like Puerto Rico.  Mexico.  So even though no one is hearing what we're saying there, Dave, our signal is everywhere.  Mm-hmm.  Where are you?  W-A-V-F.  In South Carolina.  In South Carolina.  See, that's silly, because like, as soon as you drive like a half hour, no one knows  you.  Dave Rossi's a whore! 
[01:45:30]  All right, moving on.  You got his website?  Does he have a website?  Yeah, what's Dave Rossi all about?  Might as well...  From W-A-V-F.  Give out the website, so the nobodies that listen to our show, can maybe drop him an email.  Yeah, let's show...  I think he'd appreciate that.  Let's show Dave Rossi how many nobodies we actually have.  Yeah.  It's 96 Wave.  96 Wave?  It's Storm...  What? 
[01:46:00]  Storm and...  Wait, Storm with Stupid Mike Kenny in the morning.  Oof.  The Storm and Kenny morning show.  Storm and Kenny.  Holy shit, Dave.  Please tell me you're doing middays.  Oh, no, Izzy.  The worst shift that you could do on a radio station.  Izzy.  The worst shift.  Oh, boy.  Is what, middays?  Yeah, middays.  Is that even worse than overnight?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because the people that are...  Because you're working during the day. 
[01:46:30]  See, the whole thing with radio, in the end, you want to entertain the people on the way to work,  and you want to entertain the people on the way out of work.  Right.  Middays is just, that's where you put a guy that is very safe and has a good voice, and he's not going to do anything too crazy.  He's just going to kind of keep the music going.  And nights, like, like, after afternoon drive, like 7 o'clock, that guy is still getting some people coming home, but you're also getting people that are going out.  So they're in their cars and stuff. 
[01:47:00]  Middays, they're at work.  You're sitting at work.  You can either have a radio or you can't, and then there's other choices to be made.  And if you are listening to the radio, it's in the background, because you've got stuff to do.  And the biggest thing about midday jocks are it really is about the music.  Don't talk.  People are at work.  They just want to hear music if they can listen to the radio.  They want to hear your opinions.  They don't want to hear, like, a morning guy where he'll say the news or something like that, the afternoon guys talk. 
[01:47:30]  Midday, keep your mouth shut.  Keep the music going for the people that can listen at work.  It's 96wave.com.  He might even be starting his shift soon if it's a midday shift.  We're on until 11, so maybe.  That's W-A-V-F.  Yeah, maybe he starts at 10.  Maybe someone in South Carolina.  What town is this in?  Oh, Charleston?  If someone's listening to us in that area and they could maybe tune in 96wave, we would love to listen to them.  We would love to listen to them right now.  We don't even have to wait for Dave Rossi to start his cute little midday shift. 
[01:48:00]  Let's get a listener from that area.  I want to hear that station right now.  Dave in Alabama.  Alabama man.  Alabama man.  What's up, Dave?  Daniel.  Daniel, what's up?  Nothing, man.  Dave Rossi used to do middays down here, and he was a jerk-off back then.  He'd cut in the middle of songs and do crystal commercials.  He was a freaking Seinfeld ripoff wannabe. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, it was horrible.  Okay, we'll take a listen to Dave and see how brilliant of a broadcaster he is, because he has no problem taking a shot at us.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  So he's done middays all across the country.  So this is just like a hack comedian.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The guy who's open for...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Open for everybody.  Basically, if you do middays, they don't have enough confidence in you at your radio station to give you a better shift. 
[01:49:00]  And he's probably, you know, because they have to justify his pay, so he's probably the midday slash music director.  Aren't you, Dave?  You're that guy.  You're the guy that has to talk to all the record labels.  Aren't you, Dave?  And you think you're cool because you get to add the new Green Day song.  Don't you, Dave?  Don't you, Dave?  And if you were...  That's your gig, isn't it?  If you were the midday guy at another station and you move to be the midday guy, that is really bad. 
[01:49:30]  Like, if you move from middays, you want to move to mornings or afternoons.  Right.  You don't move to do middays somewhere else.  I swear to you.  And that sucks, doesn't it, Dave?  Doesn't it, Dave?  I swear to you, I have no idea what Dave Rossi's about, and I guarantee that I just hit it on the head.  He does middays, and he's a music director.  Hit it on the head, didn't he, Dave?  Right on the head. 
[01:50:00]  He's got to schedule the music, don't you, Dave?  Don't you?  You're sitting in your office with all your rock posters and rock memorabilia, thinking  you're cool.  But secretly...  Holding all the concert tickets so the rest of the staff at the station has to come to  you.  Right, Dave?  Exactly, Dave.  Secretly hating your life.  Yep.  Aren't you, Dave?  Aren't you, Dave?  A little jealous of the people that have actually succeeded in the biz, Dave? 
[01:50:30]  A little jealous.  Ah, but he's the midday.  You have to go to every fucking show that comes through Charleston, don't you, Dave?  And you have to bring the listeners backstage for the meet and greets.  Hey, Dave, how many lunches you got to take with the record rep guys?  Huh?  How many exciting lunches do you have to go to, Dave?  Dave, are you the jock that has to go on stage and say, I'm Blah Blah from WAVF? 
[01:51:00]  And you get all those blank stares because no one gives a shit about the midday guy?  That's you, isn't it, Dave?  And they don't, do they, Dave?  Are you the one that has to actually carry the radio station banner to the gig?  After you drove the van there, Dave?  And you got the duct tape and you got to throw that on the stage, but then they tell you to  take it down because the band doesn't give a shit about your stupid station. 
[01:51:30]  That's you, isn't it, Dave?  It's you, right, Dave?  Ugh.  Ugh, indeed.  Did you learn Selector when you were 17 and you're proud of that, Dave?  No one gives a shit.  They have iPods now.  You've been replaced by an iPod, Dave.  You're irreverent.  They're programming their own music, Dave.  No one cares about Dave. 
[01:52:00]  You're an Edsel midday shift.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Do you do noontime blocks, do you, Dave?  You're the noontime block guy, aren't you, Dave?  Happy, happy, joy, joy.  Bet you have a special lunchtime song, don't you, Dave?  Yeah, what's your special feature?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's got to be a special giveaway feature that he does every day.  That hides the fact that you weren't good enough for the afternoon drive slot. 
[01:52:30]  That's you, isn't it, Dave?  Does the morning show play a song clip backwards and they have to call your show to tell you what it was so you could give them a prize, Dave?  Is it noontime blocks and free lunch?  You're the free lunch guy, aren't you?  Free lunch.  Your dream's to be on at 5 o'clock getting the lead out, isn't it, Dave?  You give lunch to one listener and his coworkers.  That's you, isn't it, Dave?  I bet you still try to grow your hair long because you still want to be a rock and roller. 
[01:53:00]  Are you rockin', Dave?  Oh, there he is.  Let's turn that around.  And he does have the long hair.  There he is.  I told you, man.  Wow, that is the picture of the guy I pictured.  Holy shit.  That's a midday guy right there.  Well, we're getting more info about the claim to fame here.  Let's hear about Dave.  Let's go to Rob in South Carolina.  Morning, boys.  How are you?  Hey.  Hey, this station down there is just garbage, man.  Their claim to fame is a bikini contest at a local beach bar. 
[01:53:30]  96 Wave, we suck.  Wait, they do a bikini contest?  Of course, they're the wave, so they've got to tie it into some type of beach thing.  I love this guy from Florida.  Frank in Florida.  Frank?  Hey, man.  Don't give this guy any more press.  That's what he wants you to do.  Come on.  Give it up.  Ooh, because we're scared of Dave.  Woo!  We talk about him.  He gets a little notoriety.  Next thing you know, his signal goes to North Carolina. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  He might hit it big.  Woo!  How is he going to fight back?  Is he going to do a block of the who?  A twofer.  We've got some twofer in there.  Yeah.  Is he the guy that has to schedule all the twofers?  Double shot of heart coming up.  Uh, and we're not trashing Ron and Fez, you idiots.  Satellite's different.  Satellite's different and talk is different.  That's right.  Than being a music jock in midday.  The show replays all over the place and we have big plans for Ron and Fez. 
[01:54:30]  So you guys relax.  We're not trashing our brothers.  We're trashing Dave.  Dave Rossi.  W-A-V-F.  We'll talk about him.  Dave.  96 wave.  That means you're faggoty rock.  Faggoty rock.  We talk about him every day for four hours and he still is never going to get out of South Carolina.  96 wave.  That means you're faggoty rock.  We could do the Dave Rossi show every day where we just praise him and still he would not get out of where he is. 
[01:55:00]  Someone makes a great point, by the way, in Iowa.  Way to help us out with the Dave trashing today, Bill Burr.  Oh, shit.  Way to go.  I guess Dave can't help you, huh, Bill?  I'm sure Patrice is here.  He'd be ragging Dave, too.  Wow.  Exactly.  That's how the fucking game works.  Hey, Dan, very good.  Pretty brave, aren't you, Bill? 
[01:55:30]  Ooh.  Go ahead, Dan in Iowa.  What's up?  I don't know, Dave.  Bill Burr, you are a fucking pussy.  You know, hoo-hoo's on the air.  You're just, oh, I don't want to say nothing.  I don't want to get too close to that microphone.  Now, when Dave's on the air, yeah, you'll fucking know.  I got to defend myself, you fat fuck.  Howard Stern hooked me up.  Howard Stern, when I had nothing going on, hooked me up.  I opened for Dave Chappelle and he was fucking cool. 
[01:56:00]  And unlike you, you fat, ham-and-cheese-eating faggot, I don't turn my back on people like that.  I'm not swayed by other people in the fucking room.  I'm not some seventh-grade girl.  Oh, my God, I have to hate who you fucking hate.  I don't hate the guy.  I think he's fucking funny, so I'm not going to sit here and fucking trash him.  All right, you fat fuck?  So why don't you go wrap your rusted Chevy Nova around the nearest fucking oak tree?  Hey, wow. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  Did he hit a nerve, though?  No, I just, you know.  Jeez.  He can just come out swinging.  All right, we got...  Didn't know Howard gave you the fucking breath of life after some drowning incident.  Jesus Christ.  He fucking hooked me up.  I had absolutely nothing going on.  You're like that chick at the end of Saturday Night Fever.  He helped me, all right?  He helped me.  All right, I'm sorry.  What are you going to do?  He helped me, all right?  You want to go for some tea or something? 
[01:57:00]  All right, let's go to John, North Carolina.  John?  Hey, guys.  I love XM.  Love it.  Hey, listen to this guy, Rob.  He was hosting the wing-eating contest at some wild wing cafe or something during the Fourth of July weekend.  Oh, he has to do those things, too?  Who, Dave?  It was pathetic.  I mean, it was the constant loud, loud PA system and five sloppy fat guys just shoving wings.  Yeah.  That's why radio guys get no respect, because of Dave's out there. 
[01:57:30]  Let's say hi to Momo.  Momo!  Hey, you guys need to leave Dave alone.  Why?  I'll kick your ass.  Because he needs him.  Everybody's got to pay their dues somewhere.  And you guys, just because you guys are, especially you, Opie, a prima donna that can't even put a weekend when you're not feeling up to snuff, you know, I mean, at least he comes to work every day.  He has to.  He's out there grinding.  He's putting his ass in there. 
[01:58:00]  Hey, Momo.  Momo, do you realize that last week I took off for one of the first times in my entire career I got hit with the flu really bad?  So that argument is stupid.  Anyone that knows this program knows that pretty much all of us work through sickness.  Ten years, and I think we've each taken a day off in ten years because we were sick.  So that argument blows.  And your other argument stinks, too, because the guy took a shot at us, so we fight back.  That's all.  No, but listen to me.  He was brave enough to take a shot at us, so we retaliate. 
[01:58:30]  What's wrong with that?  No, there's nothing wrong with that.  Is he one of your favorites, Moe?  Hey, listen here.  Does Momo listen to 96 Wave?  Favorite station, Momo.  What, did they play one of your requests one day, Momo?  Were you allowed to introduce the Leonard Skinner twofer, and you never forgot it?  Did the jock throw you a T-shirt at an appearance once, Moe? 
[01:59:00]  Were you the lucky one that got to say, hi, I'm Momo, and I listen to 96 Ways?  But you know what, I'm telling you what, I'm going to bust your chops, because you could have at least come in last week.  What?  I said, Anthony could have come in last week.  I'll field that, my friend.  I'll field that.  Do you know it's in our contract that if one of us doesn't work, the other one doesn't come in to work either?  Do you know that is written into our deal? 
[01:59:30]  That's written into our deal?  That's written into our deal.  And you know why?  Why is that?  Because we're not two phony, interchangeable jock shitheads like you see the Slappy and Wappy show in Your Town, USA,  where you can pull out guy number one and pop in zippy and whippy, and the show doesn't fucking change.  It's Opie and Anthony.  If it's one of us, then it's none of us.  It's both of us that do the Opie and Anthony show.  If one of us is sick and taking off, the other one doesn't try to do the show by himself, 
[02:00:00]  because that is not the Opie and Anthony show.  See, guys that just know a little more about radio than you do, Momo, understand how this show works.  And you know what?  They don't make a...  What?  If it wasn't for me, you all wouldn't have a job, because you know what?  I am an important subscriber to XM...  Blah, blah, blah.  Are you near your bathroom, sir?  Because I have a suggestion that a little fat feller named Jimmy Norton once told somebody. 
[02:00:30]  What's that?  Take your XM, flush it down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and go fuck your mother.  Oh, okay.  That's a hell of a comeback, sir.  I mean, Momo, come on.  He says okay.  I would love to hate you, but I really need you to come back with something.  Uh, uh, um...  Bill Burwalt will take up my back.  He's got my back right, don't you, Bill?  All right, Momo.  Another person not ready for the Sunday morning TV show. 
[02:01:00]  Bye-bye, Momo.  I'm going to come up there.  Okay.  How far is that rusted-out pickup going to get, buddy?  Virginia?  Not very.  I don't understand these guys.  You know, this guy took a shot at us, so we fight back a little.  You mean Dave?  Good old Dave.  He's organizing his music right now, getting ready for his big show.  How's it going, Dave?  Good.  Good.  He's on his computer.  What else is on this, uh...  Should we play after Jeff Rotol? 
[02:01:30]  Go to contests.  Go to shows.  Yeah.  Come on, E-Rock.  I want to see what 96 Wave is all about.  Let's get a feel for the station.  They're local.  See, satellite, we don't know anything about local, Opie.  Right.  Nothing.  What about their big events?  Big events is a link.  Click here for events calendar.  Gotta be big.  96 Wave.  It's a blank white page.  All right.  What are they up to?  Well, uh...  They're doing the Wild Wing thing. 
[02:02:00]  I guess you can hang out at a place called Firehouse.  And that's it.  That gay place down there at, uh...  That's all they got.  Oh, okay.  That's it?  The Firehouse.  The morning show.  The poor guys.  They have to show up at the Firehouse every Monday night at 8.30.  Join the Storm and Kenny morning show at the Firehouse Bar and Grill in West Ashley for  Monday night football, table sports tournaments, and fantasy football.  Also enjoy free wings and a dollar core light drafts. 
[02:02:30]  Core light?  That's how it's...  You only got one?  Can I have a core?  Oh, my God.  And then Thursday, they send the morning show out again.  Oh, these guys are road hogs?  These guys have to do fucking bar gigs.  That shit lasted for like a year with me, you know?  Yeah, we do.  We went out to bar gigs.  It's like, it was every Wednesday at Cadillacs up in Massachusetts, and we would go there, 
[02:03:00]  get hammered.  Hammered.  Absolutely.  That lasted for like two weeks.  Join Storm and Kenny at Red's Ice House on Shem Creek.  And then what's Wild Wing about on Saturday?  If it's...  I bet it involves wings.  Is it Storm and Kenny again?  What is this?  What do they have a fucking stock in chicken?  That's all they got.  Everything is about their chicken wings.  Dude, that's all their events?  Like, what do they do for like contests and stuff? 
[02:03:30]  There's nothing listed.  There's nothing listed for contests or anything?  Coming soon.  Click here for contest rules.  All right.  And then the shows don't...  Coming soon.  Something interesting.  Oh, here we go.  Every Wednesday at noon, so that's today, they do 90s at noon.  Ah, so that's what Dave is doing?  90s at noon.  90s at noon.  I'm going to pump out a little Soundgarden.  A little Nirvana.  Nirvana.  A little Pearl Jam.  I'm here, huh?  I'm feeling you. 
[02:04:00]  A little Blind Melon.  Yep.  Big...  Here they come to Snudderister.  Oh, yeah.  That's what his entire afternoon sounds like.  Where's the first fish?  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  Hey, I like the 90s.  Food man.  What's that?  He found a way. 
[02:04:30]  He found a way.  Tell me.  Yeah.  That's good.  Hey, this is Lane Staley, and you're listening to Dave Rossi on WAVF.  Now, he probably collects all his RSIDs from all his stations.  Oh, so he can't have the call thing in there?  He says, hey, it's Lane Staley.  You're listening to Dave Rossi on WAVF.  Because it came from some other station. 
[02:05:00]  This is all inside radio stuff, I understand, but all these idiots do that, too.  Hello, this is Pete Townsend.  Oh, sometimes it's not even his name.  It's like, hey, this is Lane Staley, and you're listening to Dave Rossi.  Like, they couldn't even get him to say his name.  Beth in New Orleans, Chocolate City.  What's up?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's wonderful here in the Chocolate City.  I think you guys are being assholes this morning.  Come on.  This morning? 
[02:05:30]  Well, all the time.  But he's just doing his job out there.  He picked on you, okay, I agree, you should go after him for that.  But the world is full of crappy jocks just doing remotes and getting their job done.  Oh, really, Beth?  Well, crappy jocks should not be taking shots at us.  Let's just put it that way.  Without us bringing on a world of hurt.  Beth, Beth, I'm still water coming through your ceiling, isn't it, Beth?  Beth. 
[02:06:00]  Beth, are you mad because you were the 10th caller once?  No, I used to be a jock.  Weren't you, Beth?  Oh, you were a DJ?  Yeah.  For what?  Station in New Orleans.  I was one of those girls you hate.  Oh, the hole?  The smiley, happy girl.  We call you the girls the hole of the show.  Yeah.  You never said anything funny, did you, Beth?  But a vagina.  A vagina?  A vagina?  What was the name of this show you were on?  We were Bo and Beth. 
[02:06:30]  Bo and Beth.  Ugh, the Bo and Beth show.  Is it mornings?  Yep.  Yeah.  What happened to your radio career?  My radio career, well, you know, I couldn't afford a fancy agent and didn't have the great  contract.  And we got too expensive and I said, screw it, and I was done.  Wait, too expensive for who?  When you get too expensive, that means somebody is offering you more money than where you're  at.  No, no, they, uh, it's a stupid story. 
[02:07:00]  I worked for all the same crappy companies that you did.  Yeah.  I only worked for three.  Evo, Evo, even our consultant.  Oh, God.  Oh, how about that?  He consulted you right out of there, didn't he?  Yes.  Did you guys, did you guys make fun of his haircuts?  I don't remember it being that bad.  Really?  Must have gotten worse.  Wow.  So what was your big thing you did on your show?  We were a girly station, so we did all the horrible stuff you hate.  Battle of the Sexes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we ought to pull that out. 
[02:07:30]  That's a great bit.  Sure we did.  Were you part of Thunder Country?  Thunder Country?  There's another Bo and Beth show, I guess.  Oh.  No, no, that one's not.  You franchised the name out?  Yeah, they're on Thunder Country.  I bet you that's country that rocks.  Rocks.  It's like crossover country, man.  Classic rock, that rocks.  Yeah, no fiddles on this station.  Right.  We're not your father's country.  Yeah, great.  Yeah, wonderful.  Like, that makes it any better. 
[02:08:00]  I love you anyway.  Beth, Beth, you see.  All the filthy stuff we never could.  But, Beth, you see, here's something you don't understand.  Dave Rossi took the first shot, right?  Yeah.  And we've always been from the school of, no matter what,  if someone shoots us with a pea shooter, they get hit with howitzers.  That's right.  So we might come off like assholes, but I think our buddy Dave deserves every bit of it.  And we still can't get it.  He probably does.  We still want to listen to the station.  I know. 
[02:08:30]  Well, love you.  Kiss, kiss.  Oh, you were on one of those light stations?  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  Billy Ocean.  Eek.  Billy Ocean is too rocky for a light station.  Light 105.3.  Light 105.3.  REO Speedwagon.  Are you a girl of color, Beth?  No, I am not.  Well, white.  You're white?  Yeah.  Oh, what are you...  Wow.  He's right.  The mayor's right.  The mayor's insane.  Gotta get chocolate back into New Orleans. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  We got more Dave Rossi information.  This is too good for us.  All right.  Thank you, Beth.  Bye.  I know this is very inside, but it just makes us very happy when we go down this road.  Richard in Alabama.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Richard.  Dave Rossi, his air name was Saucy Dave Rossi.  You're lying.  No, it wasn't.  Don't ever even try to say that.  You're lying.  He was on 10770X in Birmingham, and his name was Saucy Dave Rossi. 
[02:09:30]  Saucy?  And he was the program director.  Wow, this guy is tackling America one city at a time.  Saucy Dave Rossi with you.  He was hurt in Alabama, now he's hurt in South Carolina.  By the time he's 80, he'll cover all 50 states.  Right, Dave?  No.  Won't you, Dave?  Won't you, Dave?  There's, unfortunately, we can't bring up sound in here, but somebody just emailed me or IM'd me a link where you can stream the audio.  Okay.  From W-A-V-F. 
[02:10:00]  Well, why don't we stream it now?  I want to see what's the morning show.  Stream some audio, record it.  I got the link over here if you want to jot it down.  Here comes Steve.  Look at the way Steve moves.  Well, E-Rock's already on it, but he's too stupid to tell anyone else.  E-Rock's on it.  Yeah, he does that all the time to people.  No, he is.  It's frustrating.  Like, he just saw Steve running into the studio to try to get the link for the feed as Eric was running out because he has the feed.  Look, he's at the computer taking care of it. 
[02:10:30]  Is he?  Yes.  All right, let's see how long this takes.  He looks frustrated.  He does.  Oh, my.  Look at the interns around him.  Wow, look at his face.  This new batch of interns, by the way.  Yeah.  He looks like he's in Nam.  Yeah.  Over a dead body, like a dying body.  This is the most important thing in the world to E-Rock right now.  Oh, is he working hard.  Look at the focus.  Eyebrows are coming together.  Oh, frustration.  That was a fuck.  Oh, no, he's turning red.  What's going on out there?  He's so focused he can't even hear the show being pumped in right above his head. 
[02:11:00]  There are problems for E-Rock.  You notice what's going on, then?  Did you hear anything as you walked in?  No?  No.  All right, everyone's just running around like crazy now.  Just the sound of flop sweat hitting the desk.  He is sweating.  Look at his bangs are getting wet out of his hat.  He's got red, rosy cheeks.  He's losing it.  All right, here we go. 
[02:11:30]  Two interns trying to help out.  Two interns trying to help.  Anthony, as he tries to get W-A-V-F all hooked up and ready to go, I bet you he's having  a problem because all our listeners are doing the same exact thing.  Probably.  Motherfuckers.  Yeah.  So FMQB, getting back to this, Dave Rossi, his slogan for commercial radio once again  was, hey, did you hear what Opie and Anthony did on the radio today?  Nobody did.  Satellite radio, it's awesome.  And then you have JR from W-H-E-B, his slogan for commercial radio. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  The original radio.  The original radio.  That's his slogan, to get people to listen to commercial radio over satellite radio.  But that's not true.  Then you got Cindy Miller from W-B-Y-R.  Oh, wait.  I think Iraq's got something.  Yeah?  Iraq?  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, shit.  Oh, well.  I guess nothing.  We were hoping you might bring something to the table.  Iraq, the recording.  We need a recording of the radio station.  I bring nothing to the table.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Okay.  Well, we were hoping. 
[02:12:30]  You know, this is a bad scene when you have brand new interns actually trying to do it  for him.  Oh, he's back.  All right.  What's wrong, Iraq?  What's wrong, Iraq?  What's wrong, Iraq?  Oh, no.  We had it set up.  Somebody turned it off, and now the other computers that are available won't stream audio, so we  have to go set it up in the office.  It was all set and ready to go, but somebody had to turn it off.  Who are you blaming?  I'm not saying.  Who are you blaming?  Our crew?  Someone from our crew?  No.  Someone from Ron and Fez's crew? 
[02:13:00]  No.  Oh, oh.  Somebody that's supposed to be out of here.  Exactly.  Okay.  Yeah, that's never happening.  I gave up on them actually giving us this place.  Yeah.  I'm so sick of them telling us.  No, it's going to...  We had a meeting in Washington.  They said all this was going to leave, and new construction was going to start in January.  Yeah, they're going to pull all the cubicles out, and we're going to be able to...  January's half over now.  Build a great little studio lounge type area.  And I don't see one guy with a hard hat.  Yeah.  I don't see one guy with a tape measure. 
[02:13:30]  No, I don't see shit.  There's no burly men with blueprints unrolling them on the table going...  Right.  And pointing at the ceiling and beams and stuff.  So then I asked some people around here, they're like, oh, no, now they're saying spring.  I'm so sick of that corporate shit.  They push it off.  They said they were going to do this when we first got here.  Yep.  That's 15 months ago.  Then we had a meeting recently.  Oh, well, the first of the year we're going to get going with the construction.  Eh.  There's nothing going on out there.  Still every cubicle from when we got here. 
[02:14:00]  Absolutely.  Being used for nothing.  So, uh, Cindy Miller from WBYR.  Yeah.  She, uh, she writes, I can't say exactly what the slogan would be, but it would focus on  our ability to reach out and touch a listener.  Our listeners come and hang out with us at concerts and remotes, and they feel like they  know us.  They know you. 
[02:14:30]  Do they, Cindy?  Do they?  What do they know about you?  Do they?  Because do you really hang out with them at the bar?  Or do you just go to the appearance on stage and say who you are and then go back to the  VIP area?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  That's what I do.  Cindy, are you the one where everyone walks away very disappointed?  Oh!  You know what I'm talking about, right, Cindy? 
[02:15:00]  Oh!  You don't want me to tell everyone.  Oh, no.  Do you, Cindy?  Oh!  Yeah, the listeners do get to know you.  Don't they, Cindy?  They hear this hot, sexy voice talking sexy in between the records, and then these guys  are, like, turned on a little bit and a little spark of interest, like, oh, I wonder what  Cindy Miller looks like.  Hey, she's going to be at a local venue.  She's got that hot voice.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Sultry.  Sultry.  Sexy.  She's giving out swag at the local gin mill.  I'm going to go and check out this appearance.  And the station did me a favor, and they got cheap beer.  Mm-hmm.  So I'm going to go and see Cindy Miller.  Let's go see Cindy.  And then you, as the listener, you're in the audience going, that can't possibly be.  But the woman I hear on the radio every day.  You sound so sultry.  And you see looks of disappointment.  Yeah.  Don't you, Cindy?  You've looked into those faces of disappointment, haven't you, Cindy? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, you try to make something in your head that it's not really what's going through their  minds, but it is.  That's the disappointment.  I'm sure you wear the long sweaters to cover up a world of hurt.  Don't you, Cindy?  But you ain't fooling anyone.  Loose-fitting station sweatshirt.  Oh, you try the stripes to make yourself look more slender.  To cover up lonely nights of just you and Cheetos. 
[02:16:30]  Or that one outfit that you really like where it has a fake waistband that's a lot lower  than your regular waist, so it makes you look slender.  The only picture of you on the website sitting behind the console.  Well, now we have to.  Let's take a look at Cindy Miller.  Let's pop up Cindy.  Because she says, our listeners come and hang out with us at concerts and remotes, and  they feel like they know us.  Holy shit, E-Rock.  I need your help right the fuck now. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you.  I'm on the motherfucker.  WBYR.  What do you think?  Is she still using her original headshot?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, mark it.  103, man.  Your career is taking off, Cindy Miller.  Mark at 103.  98.9.  The Bear.  The Bear, everybody.  Wow.  Featuring Ramon doing mornings.  Stop it.  The Bears.  All right.  Let's take a look here. 
[02:17:30]  Bear Rockers.  Miller time.  Right there.  Miller time.  I get it.  All right.  Let's take a look.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  God damn it, did I nail it.  Spin that around.  God damn it.  Yeah.  I nailed it.  Let me see.  Wow.  I nailed it.  Wow.  Not only is she a fat pig, she's trying to still be sexy.  Dude, and there's the pictures we're talking about.  They're strategically taken to, you can't see any of her. 
[02:18:00]  There's a picture of her laying down on her stomach where you only see her forearms, her  head and her feet.  Like, it's a head-on view of her laying down on her stomach.  Then there's another one where she's kind of coming out of one of the toolbars of the  website, but it cuts off right at her breast line.  Yeah.  But you could tell by her shoulders and her arms that she's big.  That there's something big going on there.  Grandmother arm.  Yeah.  But she has that sexy voice.  Yeah.  God damn, did I nail that. 
[02:18:30]  Get to know those listeners there, Cindy?  Any more pictures of Cindy Miller?  That is a big man arm, isn't it?  Dude, you know what?  I'm just, I just have to say, I just know this business a little too well.  I worked at a radio station once, and I don't want to give out the radio station, by the  way, Anthony, because you know the story I'm about to tell.  All right.  We had a girl.  Because it's going to hurt somebody, isn't it, Opie?  I remember.  We had a girl that had an amazing radio voice.  Absolutely one of the best I've heard. 
[02:19:00]  Yep.  And it was time for us to get, like, head shots.  And, you know, they were going to throw the pictures on the website.  And this one girl, they made her wear Tom Cruise risky business sunglasses and hide behind  a tree where she was peeking out from behind the tree.  That was her shot that they used on the website.  Yep.  That was it.  Now, did they take a whole bunch of other shots, and then they just threw that one in 
[02:19:30]  so she wouldn't notice that?  She was just peeking out from behind the tree, just showing what would have been her eyes,  but they were covered by sunglasses.  So she's behind a tree.  She's peeking out from the side of the tree with sunglasses on.  They could not have covered her up more.  And that was it.  Was it a Redwood?  A giant Sequoia?  Let's go to Tom in South Carolina. 
[02:20:00]  Tom?  Hey, ma'am.  Look here.  These guys, no doubt, are the best in the business, but I've got to say, I'm in Charleston,  South Carolina.  I'm in the 96 Wave market.  These guys are not part of the corporate world that you guys despise.  These guys have been out for years.  Oh, stop.  All right.  Well, we can listen to the Wave right now.  You're listening to the Bear.  This is the Wave.  Oh.  Who is this? 
[02:20:30]  I have no idea.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  What kind of music I don't listen to?  Are they a country station?  I have no idea.  This has like a country twang to it.  You've done it?  Is this the homegrown section of the show? 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  Is this the outfield?  I don't know.  We'll keep it in the background if they start talking.  Yeah, when they start talking, boy, I want to hear it.  All right.  Moving on with the slogan for commercial radio.  They just had a lot of fun with this at FMQB.com.  Dan Bozik from KUFO.  His slogan for commercial radio to make you listen to commercial radio over satellite radio. 
[02:21:30]  Still free, bitch.  Yeah.  Man, he's tough.  Trying to move on here.  The UFO.  Ryan Patrick from KAZR.  Terrestrial radio.  We brought you the pussycat dolls.  What more do you want?  What?  What does that mean?  They're really hot.  They're all banned.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  But I think satellite was also playing them at the same time.  So how does that possibly make sense?  Danny Wright, KSXY.  If it's free, it's for me.  Alan Fox, WRHT.  Hot FM, where the FM stands for free music.  Hey, that's good.  He figured that out.  Yeah.  And that's it.  That's pretty much it.  It just goes on and on.  It's more horseshit from guys all over the country. 
[02:22:30]  Question of the week.  Yes, Ben.  Oh, Ben just coming in.  Oh, it just came in.  I want to listen.  Oh, this is widespread panics, I would say.  The waves.  I can't even hear it.  It sounded like a banjo in the beginning.  Yeah.  It sounds way off.  I'm like, I don't listen to country.  I know.  I thought it was country.  Anyone know if it's almost over?  The long of a sudden. 
[02:23:00]  That's widespread panic.  It could go on for a while.  Is the morning show still on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  God, we would love to play music.  Then we would have cut this bit in half for you.  Of course.  Come on.  It's going to be a 15-minute song if it's widespread panic.  All right.  Here we go.  Tellers.  That's it?  They're singing songs right in the Killers. 
[02:23:30]  That's all you get?  That's all you get is small letters?  Keep it available.  All right.  It's on.  We've got to listen to the morning show.  All right.  Should we take a break and get Bob Kelly in here?  Yeah.  Oh, Bob's here.  Steve and him were just here.  Poor Bob.  Bob of the MySpace Massacre.  Yes.  There he is.  They just had a hybrid conversation.  I'm out there, him and Steve, talking about hybrid cars.  You know something?  I've read about the hybrid cars even more so than when we first were bringing them up. 
[02:24:00]  These things are not doing anything.  They're not saving.  I don't care what anyone says.  Steve will sell it.  It's a scam.  It is.  The oil companies.  I remember they're getting like 48 miles to gallon.  Do you remember in the late 70s when those Japanese cars were getting that?  Yeah.  The break with the regular ones.  Yeah.  Regular engines were like, oh, 50 miles per gallon with the Honda Civic.  The couple went up to 60.  I remember seeing 70.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, I don't know what happened.  The 80s came in.  Here it comes.  And that was it. 
[02:24:30]  Defend your car, Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  I've done a lot.  And the latest issue of Popular Mechanics came in.  And steward them.  Now, Popular Mechanics, that's where you go for this type of research.  Yeah, but Popular Mechanics also said that we're going to have flying cars by now.  They laugh at themselves sometimes.  They take a look back.  And you look back on the pages of Popular Mechanics and they go, look at what idiots we were.  We thought there was going to be a flying car.  And they show something from like 1920 and, you know, the jet pack is right around the corner. 
[02:25:00]  And they laugh at that.  But they did all kinds of things on these hybrid vehicles, Steve, one of which you have.  And it turned out not really this great amount of savings that you're getting and not worth the cost of the actual vehicle for what you're getting.  I see what you're saying.  You can just buy a smaller car.  Like the Prius, it's kind of a compact car.  It is.  So if you buy a compact car with a regular internal combustion engine, you're going to get good mileage. 
[02:25:30]  I see what you're saying.  At the time I got it, I got the, what is it, the rebate.  Uh-huh.  The rebate for buying it.  It was a smaller car that I could drive into the city every single day and not have to worry about.  Because before that, I was driving an SUV that was costing me a bloody fortune to fix.  Honey dispenser on the dash, too.  Exactly.  That was a great selling point.  Exactly.  Bees in the trunk.  Thank you.  So there it goes.  Exactly.  Does it at least burn cleaner than, say, it is. 
[02:26:00]  It's environmentally sound vehicle.  That's nothing.  Why am I listening to a man who drives a fucking car and has a rack of his rifles?  It's an Escalade, my friend.  You couldn't get any further in the other direction.  It's a direct.  I know, man.  So, you know.  I understand.  And if I could, you know, if I could realistically have an Escalade that would get better mileage,  I probably would.  I mean, hell.  I mean.  But they're saying it really, the cost doesn't work out. 
[02:26:30]  You could do it for these environmental reasons.  And I don't know.  I don't know if I agree with that necessarily.  Because I'm spending so much less on filling up the tank.  Because you were driving a big vehicle, a gas guzzler.  A gas guzzler versus one.  But I think you would have gotten the same amount of savings with a regular smaller car.  There's no smaller car out there that's getting 46 miles to the gallon, at least on average.  There aren't.  They don't exist.  I'll have to give you the article.  Okay.  Thank you.  How the hell did we have them in the late 70s?  And then they just went away.  Yeah.  All of a sudden they went away. 
[02:27:00]  They were saying 50 miles to the gallon you'll get with the new Volkswagen friggin' whatever  it was.  Diesel.  Or diesel.  Diesel was getting a lot of, was getting good mileage.  And it still does.  But diesel.  Oh.  Oh.  Who wants to deal with a diesel?  Storm and Kenny Radio Show 96.  Here it is.  Looking for someone who knows today's official show sponsor.

This is the local and independent 96 Ways.  Oh, my God.  I got douche chills. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  There's your free radio, everybody.  That's your Snatch bit.  There's your free radio.  Enjoy.  That's it.  Enjoy, kids.  Didn't cost you dime one.  You could have listened to that.  And now you hear the Snatch bit, right?  You have exactly the same amount of money in your pocket as before the Snatch bit.  Not a dime was taken to listen to that.  Fake commercials. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  All right.  Holy shit.  Snatch.  That's some cutting-edge free radio that you're getting there.  And who was the guy that didn't want the Snatch on his face?  Yeah, why wouldn't...  Hey, watch it.  Don't get that Snatch on my face.  I don't get it.  Wouldn't he want Snatch on his face?  Or if you're going to do that, wouldn't you have, like, a gay-sounding voice do that?  Like, see, because you don't put deodorant on your face.  Right, on your face.  So that would make sense.  But then for a gay guy to say, hey, what are you doing getting Snatch on my face? 
[02:30:00]  Or how about you have a Snatch aftershave so you could say, hey, I'm putting Snatch on my face.  Yeah, but yeah, the reference is...  The writing didn't work.  The writing didn't work because it referenced deodorants and then...  Right, Steve, and where the hell was Ramone?  I don't know.  Nowhere to be found.  There was no Ramone.  Ramone, get me the Snatch.  Snatch. 
[02:30:30]  See, on satellite, they could have used cunt deodorant.  That's right.  And for a small fee every month, you get that.  Snatch.  There you go.  It was free.  I don't know how we compete against that.  I don't know what we could possibly do.  You don't.  We're sunk.  I quit.  It's brilliant comedy and it's free.  We're done in this business.  Is that the quality going out over your station, Dave?  Because Dave might be the program director instead of the music director.  He had to approve that bit, probably. 
[02:31:00]  He has a title.  We just don't know what yet.  You approved it.  I'm assistant MD or MD?  Well, one of the guys called and said he was a program director somewhere else.  So now I'm starting to think that Dave might be...  Program director?  Midday slash program director.  All right.  That's pretty big.  Very impressive on the radio resume.  I'm just thinking music director.  Could wear a couple different hats.  Instead of a couple salaries.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  All right.  We've got to take a break, I guess.  We don't have to, but Bob Kelly's here.  And we're going to play a game we like to play from time to time called Coming or Going. 
[02:31:30]  Well, we've only played it once before.  This was the first bit we ever did on XM Radio.  We're back two years...  ...947 looking for someone who knows today's official show sponsor.  96 Major Live and Local.  Who's this, please?  Here's Dustin.  Dustin, which part of the little country are you representing?  Right now, the highway from the Don Hole Bridge.  Don Hole Bridge.  What's here?  What's here?  Is it raining outside today? 
[02:32:00]  No, it's clear.  It's just windy as anything, man.  All right, Dustin, you know today's official show sponsor.  You get a gift certificate for 50 free weights, courtesy of Hooters.  Hooters, North Charleston, Hooters, T-shirt.  Poor guys.  And, Hooters, watch all the NFL playoff action, especially this Sunday at the NFC Championship Games.  Dustin, who is today's official show sponsor?  Today's Storm and Kenny radio show is brought to you by making your speaker stands all speaking stands.  All right, let us now do official show sponsor of Jack the Mash and see if that's correct.  Today's Storm and Kenny radio show is brought to you by...  Making your speaker stands all speaking stands. 
[02:32:30]  Nicely done, Dustin, and because you said it exactly correct, you will now be awarded with final level status.  You have touched the final level.  You knew without knowing.  We have finished our journey.  Nicely done, Dustin.  Hold on.  Super Mike's going to take care of you, okay?  Thanks for being part of the show, man.  Awesome, man.  Sounds good.  Thank you.  I hope it's a Panthers-Steelers Super Bowl.  I just want to tell you guys, Mikey, you being a Panthers fan, Storm and a Steelers fan, just because I want Steelers to speak the crap out of us being Panthers. 
[02:33:00]  I'll watch the game with you, Mikey.  Panthers are going to do very good.  I respect your team and you as a, you know, as you as a fan.  I wouldn't be one of those obnoxious other team fans.  I might be.  I might be.  I like your team and you as a fan as well, Storm.  Mike is the biggest.  I was really nice about the Giants.  You were nice about the Giants.  The only time I got in the paper and we picked those other teams that weren't either of our teams.  Yeah, but I wouldn't watch the game.  But you see how I get.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:33:30]  And I couldn't watch, if you're, if I couldn't watch a game with you, if my other teams were coming, I could watch a game with you tomorrow.  I'm boring.  Are you watching a game with me?  But free.  Opie.  But free.  That cost you nothing to listen to, except that fraction of your life.  That is just gone.  Gone, never to return.  That fraction of your life that just broke off your body and is just spinning into other space.  It's gone.  Wow.  Fraction of time you spent waiting for something funny. 
[02:34:00]  Waiting for anything to happen.  I do feel for those guys, though.  You do?  Yeah, they're doing all the stuff they have to do.  All that hacky radio crap.  How long?  Because sponsorships and commercials run commercial radio.  Yeah.  I hope, I hope it's early in their careers.  I hope this isn't where they are, like, later in their careers.  Are they younger guys, maybe?  And I hope for their sake they are.  I don't know.  Good luck to you, fellas.  Yeah, they look kind of young. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Storm and Kenny.  There you go.  I'm sorry, fellas.  They're pounding the pavement and getting rid of those wings.  Geez, I would punch the sales staff in the fucking face.  Do you think these guys are, like, freaking out and want to go up to the sales staff and go,  Wings?  All the time, everything about us is wings.  Free wings at our appearances.  What do you win today?  Oh, wings.  Wings from Hooters.  Wings from...  Get something else.  But no, they have to do everything. 
[02:35:00]  And why 53 wings?  53 wings?  Yeah, they were giving out 53 wings, I think.  I'm sure it means something.  Nathaniel figured it out.  Is that 53 the wave?  Rain man.  Kind of figures everything out.  53 is the square root of what the...  Let's go to Greg in Charleston.  Greg?  Hey, man.  Hey.  You got it.  Oh, 53 wings.  What were you talking?  Exactly right.  From Chocolate City?  53 wings.  I thought they were giving out 53 wings. 
[02:35:30]  How many do you ask us?  53 wings.  Well, you're calling fan, like, brilliant for figuring it out.  It was just that I misspoke.  Jesus.  53 wings.  I thought they were giving out 53 wings.  It's 53 wings.  Shit.  Greg in Charleston, what's up?  Hey, man.  I want to let you know you've got it exactly right, O.  You're like, you're reading his bio.  And his name is now Diamond Dave Rossi. 
[02:36:00]  Diamond Dave Rossi, huh?  Yes.  They were riding high for a while.  Then they turned their back on music, just like MTV did, and took the alternative route.  They did a real nice free concert for all of Charleston for a while, and that died.  And I don't know what they're doing now.  I'm getting the chills listening to it.  So please just stop it.  It's terrible.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Listen to it.  Thank you.  Honestly, this stuff is really easy to do, though.  Every station has, like, the rocker dude that kind of does nights. 
[02:36:30]  Then the conservative dude that's not going to say anything too crazy, do him midday.  Yeah.  Then you've got the hot-sounding chick that's a fat fucking mess.  And then a show with, you know, a couple dudes and a guy.  Every station.  That's exactly how it is.  There it is.  And then you've got the raging alcoholics that do weekends.  Free of charge.  Raging alcoholics do weekends.  That's your free radio, people.  All right.  Grab it up while you can. 
[02:37:00]  Bob Kelly's going to join the program next.  Get a good one.  We'll play Coming or Going.  Speaking of hacky radio.  Hacky radio is our first bit.  We'll give our version of hacky radio next.  Yep.  It's called Coming or Going.  Prepare to be waffled.  What knockers.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Burn, burn, it's so good to burn.  Burn, burn, it's so good to burn.  Burn, burn, it's so good to burn. 
[02:37:30]  Burn, burn, it's so good to burn.  Bill Burr in the studio helping us out today.  Bob Kelly's around here somewhere.  Attacking unknown DJs in the middle of nowhere.  Let's see what that station's doing.  Turn down our music.  Yeah.  Back to the wave in Charleston, South Carolina.  The most music. 
[02:38:00]  The best music.  Any station that has like the most music, pretty much saying that their air staff stinks.  They want the least amount of air staff talking.  And they're so out of touch by even saying that because nowadays you can get almost every song possible on your iPod.  So to say you have more music than anyone else is just completely ridiculous.  The best of the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 0s. 
[02:38:30]  The thousands.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  There he is.  Bob Kelly, everyone, in studio.  It's been a while.  Happy Merry Christmas.  We haven't seen you in a while.  Happy Hanukkah.  What's happening?  Why would you say Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah?  That's like a month ago.  I haven't seen you in three months.  Well, Happy St. Paddy's Day to you then.  It's been a while.  I've been smoking since the last time I've seen you.  You did.  How long now? 
[02:39:00]  Three months.  Three months?  Yeah.  And?  Pretty good.  Great.  I feel fantastic.  I can sleep through the night without waking up.  I was waking up four or five times a night coughing so bad that I'd pass out almost.  My head would go numb.  And just something would come out of me.  I don't even know what it was like.  It's a good time to quit.  Just phlegm and something.  I ate.  It would just flop out and go into the toilet.  It was just that bad.  And you were hacking that bad.  And that's what made you quit, huh?  Yeah, I would pass out.  I would cough so hard that my lips would go numb. 
[02:39:30]  You know when you'd do that when you'd breathe and the sun would choke you?  No.  Never.  You never did that?  And you'd be going, Dad, cut it out.  You never did that?  You woke up and your hiney was sore?  No.  No.  No, I don't remember that.  You never breathed heavy and been choked out.  Wait a minute, Dad.  You never.  I've heard of the pass out game.  You can't feel your lips and your.  There was like a game that kids would talk about, but I never saw it played. 
[02:40:00]  Somebody must have done it.  And it was, you would hyperventilate and then another kid would get behind you and grab  you by the chest and like lift you up while squeezing your chest and you'd pass out.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like a game.  But you'd literally wake up and your whole body would be numb.  And your tongue would be hanging out of your mouth like a cow.  And your lips would be just tingling and all.  Drool would be just flipping out.  Yeah, it's called no blood going to your head. 
[02:40:30]  It's great.  But yeah, it was, I mean, if you had nothing to do and you were poor, that's what you did  for fuck.  Couldn't afford video games.  Couldn't buy a pong.  Choked each other out.  Choked each other out.  I didn't have G.I. Joe or Pong, so I have to choke each other out.  I would think the game, the game in my school was they would just grab you on either  side of your neck.  Nobody realizing you're just grabbing somebody and just squeezing both jugulars.  Yeah.  The person would just cut off circulation in the brain.  It's better than going under a porch with your best buddy. 
[02:41:00]  Well, that guy's not you today.  Jimmy would do that.  There was a kid in my elementary school that used to go around and karate chop people right  in the throat.  And he nailed me once at the locker.  He would just do it.  And he was known to do this.  And if you were unsuspecting, like if you saw him coming, you'd chin down, you'd cover  your throat up and go, no, and then run away or just get away from me.  But he would come up and just go, flock.  And you'd just start choking in the hallway as everyone laughed.  Was he Asian?  No, he was some like Italian kid who was into karate and shit. 
[02:41:30]  But he was one of those kids that learned karate, but not the lesson that's supposed  to go along with it of discipline and only use it for a fight.  Yeah.  Like he learned it.  He learned it and wanted to use it on a daily basis.  Right.  Like I'm fucking...  Someone gives him the wrong change.  Yeah.  Swap right in the throat.  Throw his shit.  Yeah.  He's going to the Cobra Kai school of karate.  Definitely the Cobra Kai.  Will you...  Finish him!  Will you go to the prom with me?  Oh, no.  You're fucking trilling. 
[02:42:00]  Bitches laying on the floor.  Time to go to bed.  That was a real scumbag.  But yeah, choking out.  Yeah.  But like you're saying, you cough like that and that's what's happening.  You're losing blood pressure in your head.  The sickest part is, though, is I did this for two years.  I smoked.  I'm smoking and I actually learned to make that just part of my life.  Like this is what I do.  I hack until I pass out.  I stayed at Dane's house in California and all you hear me all night, just heaving up 
[02:42:30]  stuff and I mean, running to the bathroom and I would puke up phlegm.  Just these...  Thank God.  You were probably in a wing of his house that was away from his wing.  Does he have a big house now?  He has the same apartment, but I mean, he's just...  Apartment?  Yeah.  He's just retarded.  He just sold out the garden in Boston.  17,000 people.  Of course.  17,000 people in two days.  He sold out.  He's doing his HBO Hour special.  I don't see them canceling his fucking MySpace account. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, he's actually...  Dude, he's helping me out.  These...  Oh, Tom.  I hope...  Dude, he's...  We talked about it on the show, so get into it.  Dude.  You lost your MySpace account.  Who loses their MySpace account?  I'll tell you who.  Somebody has the same name as a black rapper, singer.  R. Kelly.  This is what happened.  I had Dane, because Dane pretty much has the same amount of friends as Tom, the founder  of MySpace.  And he called up, you know, had some connections, and this is what they think happened. 
[02:43:30]  Uh-huh.  That it was a mistake.  My account deletion was a mistake.  It was a mistake that somebody from R. Kelly's camp, the singer...  Right.  The singer.  The singer.  Ratted me out.  Or said, you know, this guy's pretending to be R. Kelly.  Okay?  And somebody from MySpace deleted my account.  Just hit a button. 
[02:44:00]  And everything just...  4,500 people.  And you know what?  Look it.  I never went to anybody and said, hey, I want to add you.  I never went and solicited friends.  People just came to me.  So it's like 4,500 people, but you kind of get protective of these people.  Like other comics would come to my site and try to leave a comment.  I don't even know you.  They're trying to steal my friends.  Trying to get people to sign up on their site.  Right.  And it's like you're like, you know, it's almost like you're using friends as currency.  Like a friend of yours needs something.  Listen, you know.  They're like cigarettes in prison. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, like you actually sent me an email.  Listen, I put you on my top eight to help out.  I did.  It's like giving me...  I got about 10,500 friends.  He's got a big...  Billy did the same.  He's got a big show, you know, sword show coming up at Rascals in New Jersey.  Oh, yeah.  I like to plug that.  He's going to...  A what?  Taking my rapier demonstration.  What?  I'm wondering, what are you going to do with all these friends?  He doesn't have an act or...  I mean, what are you going to do?  You're going to...  How about I plug the fact that I'm on a frigging radio show? 
[02:45:00]  That's right.  How about I plug if we're going to be...  This is our act right here.  We're going somewhere.  You're living our act.  Don't you just do it on the radio?  What?  But they're already there.  They've already purchased...  This is for new people that come across and...  All those people.  All those 10,000 people just went, hey, look at this man with this M16.  I want to be friends with him.  Those aren't all Opie and Anthony listeners.  Are you delusional, man?  Yeah, dude.  Some of them are, but some of them are friends of the friends of the band. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, you probably have some of my friends, my original people that I want back now.  Don't worry.  I'll give them back.  So how many friends do you have on your new account?  38.  Well, dude, do you know what it says on the 50s?  I showed Anthony the email.  It says...  Not much better, by the way.  It's 371 friends.  Oh, right.  Is there a picture of Waterloo in the background?  Well, this is the thing.  Oh, wait, wait.  Oh.  Is it over? 
[02:46:00]  Is the morning show over yet?  Well, now we're waiting for Dave Rossi.  We want to see what kind of chops he has.  Does he do, like, three songs?  I have no idea.  He hasn't talked yet.  And then, come on.  It's been at least three songs.  Back sell.  Front sell.  One more song.  We'll have to wait and see.  Come on.  In New York.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's up, Mike? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, we used to play a game called Watery Eye.  We'd casually walk up to our friend and point him in the eye and say,  Watery Eye.  You'd poke him in the eye and say, Watery Eye.  Yeah, we stopped doing that when we were about 21.  I went up to my friend, Chuck, and I was like, I said,  Mike, Watery Eye got him really good.  And he's like, no more.  We've got to stop doing it.  We are stopping Watery Eye right now.  I can't see.  God damn it.  You ever play blindside tackle?  That's the best game, man. 
[02:47:00]  Where you set up one of your friends, like, you know,  you have someone kneel behind him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then someone comes out of nowhere and blocks him.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, and then you push him over backwards.  That game.  Someone has their head down getting stuff out of the locker,  and you just cross-check them.  Those old metal lockers from the 50s.  Or slam the door on their head.  That's always good, too.  But you ever play the one where you punch your friend right in the asshole muscle?  We've heard about you guys playing that game.  And, no, again, never play the punch the guy in the asshole.  I'm just out on that one, unfortunately, Bob. 
[02:47:30]  Nobody plays my games.  It's because they all involve the asshole in horrid games.  So far, it's passing out and being fisted.  Pretty much the Bob Kelly game.  Let's go to Sean and Miniola.  Sean.  Yo, yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, Sean.  I want to say that back in the day we used to play this game.  We'd do, like, ten squats real fast.  And then you have your friend push on your chest as hard as you can.  That's like the game where you pass out.  And then people started hitting their head and stuff.  And that's when the teachers got involved and you couldn't play no more. 
[02:48:00]  Ten squats.  Good to get done.  It's anything to screw with your blood pressure.  And then you squeeze the chest or the neck.  Yeah, yeah.  You're out.  Weird information at the end.  That's when the teacher got involved.  All right, they just hit the deck.  Yeah.  That's when the teacher got involved in.  We couldn't play anymore.  What?  God damn.  Wow.  Let's go ahead now.  Let's choke somebody out.  Dude, I don't understand the MySpace.  They said that I had copyright infringement on my page and some other legal job. 
[02:48:30]  If you go to...  I have actually a copy of my old MySpace from my web guy who created it for me.  Yeah.  If you go to robertkellylive.com backwards slash MySpace, it has a photo of what it looked like.  And you tell me if you see anything, anything that has copyright infringement or anything.  Well, if that was the fact, like half of the sites would be gone because you post music on them.  Yeah.  Dude, look at it, dude.  You tell me if you see anything.  There's nothing.  I've looked at it.  It must have been one of your friends had something that was bad. 
[02:49:00]  No, look at it right now.  Go check it out.  I'm not popping it up right now.  We're not going to look at your...  Do you think we really care?  I hope so.  Hopefully not.  I mean, just a little bit.  It makes for a good story for two minutes, and then we're going to move on to other shit.  That's your hell of a life.  I like the goatee, dude.  It's my sick goatee.  It's coming off today.  When he had the wool cap on, he had a Jacques Cousteau's crew look.  That looks kind of cool.  It gives a little edge.  A little edge to open.  A little edge.  It's evil opie if it was a sitcom. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, a little edge to open.  But he needs like a beret and the goatee and a little eyeliner on the bottom like in Star Trek.  And a bikey leather jacket that doesn't fit.  It's like a little too tight.  Ugh.  With gloves that their knuckles are cut out.  And then we'll punch each other in the assholes.  And choke each other out.  Let's go to Paul in Virginia.  Paul.  Hey, guys.  I always play a game called Snot Willie.  It's like Wet Willie, but you dig one real good in your nose and put it in someone's ear.  Oh, God.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, Snot Willie.  I like Snot Willie.  It's disgusting.  You got away with that.  Very good.  It's awful.  Let's go to Jason in Arizona.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Wait, hold on a second.  Oh, yeah.  Nothing yet?  Modest Yahoo, though.  Nothing from Saucy Dave Rossi?  Not yet.  Jason, Arizona.  Go.  Yeah, back in the day, we used to play a game called, we'd roll up to people and say,  hey, you want a Hurts donut?  And then they're like, what's that? 
[02:50:30]  And we'd fucking nail him right in the fucking sternum.  It'd be like, Hurts donut.  All right.  Check it out, boys.  Let's go to Samantha in Texas.  Samantha.  Yes.  Hey, Samantha.  We used to play kick it in the twat.  Samantha.  Yes.  Go ahead.  Turn that radio down because you're being very distracted.  You stupid bitch.  Okay, sorry.  Yes, you're being very distracted.  Holy crap.  See, the signal, we're talking into a mic, but then it's got to go beamed up into outer 
[02:51:00]  space.  Then it's got to come back.  And does that take a little time?  It takes a little bit of time, so there's a delay.  Look, for the future callers, we're on a delay.  Turn down your radio so we can talk to you.  I turn it down.  All right, good.  Don't turn it up because you'll hear me call you a stupid bitch.  Go ahead, Samantha.  Oh, well, my space broke because, like, there's a lot of friends, but Tom sucks because he  deleted my account, and I didn't have no copyright infringement. 
[02:51:30]  What was the deletion reason?  He said because what I had on my page was inappropriate.  Samantha.  Were there naked pictures of you?  No.  Oh, okay, then we don't want to talk to you.  Samantha, with a naked picture of a chick that you pretended was you?  No.  Samantha?  Yes?  You don't have anything to add to this program, do you?  Okay.  Do you, Samantha?  Probably, but probably not. 
[02:52:00]  Samantha.  Yes?  On your MySpace, your photo, was it just your eyeball?  Yeah.  Okay.  I've seen that chick.  I know who you are.  I've seen that chick.  It's just her eyeball.  There are some girls that, like, it's just a picture of, like, their hair.  It's just an eye line or just an eyeball, a big blue eye with some mascara on it.  Yeah.  And then you go to other pictures.  Oh, it's just a mess.  Oh, wow.  It's a mess.  It's just, you know she's a fat chick when it's just an eyeball or a lip or, like, just 
[02:52:30]  a little bit of cleavage.  Yeah, but you know what's unreal is anybody can get one hot photo.  One good photo of themselves.  That's why you always have to go click on other ones.  You click on other pictures and then you go, oh, what happened?  I like the hot photo from a distance and you're squinting.  So then you click on it and it's still, like, way off in, like, the fucking woods or something.  And then they get to the real one.  They're, like, fucking...  Yeah.  How about the one where you're just a hot chick and then you click on it and there's just pictures 
[02:53:00]  of her ugly with her kid?  It's like, ugh.  Hey, can I interrupt for a second?  Of course.  I will bet a lot of money that Dave Rossi, if he's on right now, can be talking after  this song.  Saucy Dave Rossi after this song?  Yeah, because you've got to backsell the new music and this is a newer song.  Oh, you never play the newer song and then go right into another song.  No, you've got to backsell it.  You've got to tell your listeners what they just heard.  I believe he's going by Diamond Dave.  Diamond Dave.  Oh, is it?  Saucy.  And he's going to have to tell the people that this is Modish Yahoo.  Saucy was his Alabama name. 
[02:53:30]  Is this him?  All right.  Should be any second.  Yeah.  Let's hear.  Can't wait.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They did a great job with this song on David Letterman, by the way, a couple nights ago.  I'm so psyched to hear him now.  He's like a celebrity to me now.  He has to talk after this song.  You don't let a new song go by on the radio without backselling it. 
[02:54:00]  You know he's an EMT, right?  He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, David Lee Roth, you mean.  David Lee Roth.  Yeah, he's a acidic EMT.  Who?  David Lee Roth.  Oh.  Acidic EMT.  Only for Jewish people.  If you die and you're a Catholic in front of him, you're screwed.  Done for.  You're done for.  How much longer is this tune?  It should be near the end, I thought.  Who is this? 
[02:54:30]  Madish Yahu.  Oh.  That's that Hasidic guy, right?  Yeah, rapper.  Reggae.  It's pretty good.  A little of everything.  You can be boss.  It's a gimmick.  Nah, I like the whole city.  Here we go.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Dave Rossi.  Wow.  I am so wrong.  Holy crap.  They don't talk on this station. 
[02:55:00]  And he's going to make fun of us?  He doesn't even do a show.  It's already, what, 16 minutes into his shift?  Yep.  And nothing out of him.  That's what makes us different, man.  Man.  Let's go to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We used to play this game called Open Neck, where, like, you see a friend reading in school,  or they're not paying attention, and you run up behind them and slap the shit out of the back of their neck, you know?  I'll throw your elbows up to your ears, you know, your shoulders up to your ears, because you don't want to get slapped in the neck. 
[02:55:30]  Open Neck.  When you see someone's open neck.  Yeah.  Bob, Bob, you know, the copyright of Frenchman might have been R. Kelly's name.  Yeah, but I didn't put R. Kelly.  And R. Kelly?  No, well, you don't.  I had Robert Kelly.  You can't even.  You can't even.  You can't even.  You can't even.  Robert Kelly, too.  Yeah, but so what?  I know.  I'm a fat comedian from New York.  He's a millionaire that.  That they were doing.  That's probably.  Pisses on teenage girls.  He doesn't go by. 
[02:56:00]  He goes by R. Kelly, but he does go by Robert Kelly, too.  Oh, he doesn't?  Yeah, I went on the internet, and he does.  Oh, boy.  But that's what the guy's telling me.  That I might have.  But still, I didn't have any of his music up there.  Give a shit about him.  Yeah, who cares?  I had 4,500 friends.  Let's go to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike?  I never peed on a minor.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, we used to play a game called Thailand.  Uh-oh.  Hey, you'd walk up to them and ask them what the capital of Thailand was, and they looked  just, you know, crazy to say Bangkok and punch him in the dick. 
[02:56:30]  They're awful games.  I like that one.  Bangkok, and then...  I think somebody did that to her.  Sounds familiar.  You saw it happen?  Is that right?  At least, yeah.  Childhood molestation memories.  Like, wait a minute.  Does that happen?  Oh, that is really good.  That went win.  You ever seen the inside of a van?  All right, let's say hi to Donahue in Philly.  Donahue. 
[02:57:00]  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Uh, Bob knows me.  I'm the one that told him about the Vicodin trick under his tongue.  Oh, that's you?  You're psycho.  You got me...  I almost had to go to rehab because of this asshole.  What happened?  That's the Vicodin trick.  Remember when I hurt my leg?  Yeah.  The guy...  I was taking the Vicodin, but it wasn't kicking in right.  He goes, listen.  He...  Yeah, he used to message me, I think he emailed me.  He says, uh, smash up the Vicodin.  A half a Vicodin.  And put it under your tongue.  And then eat the whole one.  So, no, I was eating the whole one and then putting the other one under my tongue like 
[02:57:30]  cocaine.  Those things are huge, though.  They're huge.  They are.  Even half a one would make like a...  You were supposed to cut half up and crush it and eat the other half, not a whole other  pill.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you know what, dude?  You might want to type that in before you wind me up in rehab.  The Betty Ford Clinic.  Dude, I was out of my mind for a week.  I was waking up shaking.  My hands were quivering.  That shit makes you itch.  Dude, it makes you do a lot of things.  Let me tell you.  It makes you itch.  Let's take a look for that toothache I had. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  That toothache I had last year and I just ran out yesterday.  Oh, shit.  We just lost the feed.  How do we lose the feed?  I fucked up.  Oh, no.  I fucked up.  Are you guys going to talk now?  How long is it going to take?  Out of the way.  Don, are you doing anything else?  Yeah.  Yo, I was actually talking to little Jimmy about this two nights ago.  What they might have done, Bob, is they might have bombed your MySpace account.  What you got to do is you got to set all your, like, little notes on your website so you personally approve them so they can go on. 
[02:58:30]  Because what somebody could have done is they could have put up, like, an R. Kelly song.  Like, one of his people put an R. Kelly song in one of your comments and then reported you.  So what you got to do is you got to click on account settings and set your privacy settings.  Oh, okay, man.  You know, dude, email me that.  Would you?  Will you email me that information?  Hit me up on...  All right.  All right, cool.  Next time I see you on email, I'll email you.  I appreciate that.  All right, yeah.  If anybody wants to add me, it's J Donahue on MySpace. 
[02:59:00]  D-O-N-O-G-H-U-E.  It's not MySpace.  It's MySpace.  All right, Donahue.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  They're playing another song.  Holy crap.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Connecticut.  Chuck.  Maybe they have a Wi-Fi and they're listening.  We probably got the guy real nervous today.  Chuck, what's up?  Not much.  How are you?  Hey.  Point.  Chuck.  Chuck.  Yes.  Yes.  Hi. 
[02:59:30]  You're nervous, aren't you?  Aren't you, Chuck?  Yes.  I fucking love that.  It's a new bit that we are working on.  It's pretty funny.  I like it.  It's going to give it...  We need a little more time with it, but...  Chuck?  Yes.  You're still sitting there.  Aren't you, Chuck?  Chuck?  Aren't you, Chuck?  Chuck?  Yes.  Okay.  What do you got for the show?  I've got a game to play with my friends called Fish Hook. 
[03:00:00]  Right in the wound, somebody's yawning.  Jamie's finger in their mouth and I hook them right in the cheek.  Jesus Christ.  You put your finger in somebody's mouth?  Yeah.  That's not good.  No, you don't want to...  I don't want that.  No, I'm not playing that game.  I'd rather get...  Bangkok would be better than that.  Bangkok was the best one.  Thank you, Chuck.  No problem.  All right.  And I wouldn't fish hook...  Fish hook and punch in the ass game.  I'm not playing.  The other ones... 
[03:00:30]  Or Bangkok.  I don't want to play Bangkok.  So I can choke you out?  Choke me out.  You don't want to play Bangkok.  You don't want to choke me out before Bangkok or punch in the ass game.  I wonder if anybody ever tried that game with, like, Master Poe when he was in, like,  the eighth grade.  Somebody just slapped the back of his neck.  As he whirls around and pulls you out of the room by your nostrils.  Have you seen his MySpace photo?  His photo.  He has a student in, like, some sort of reverse headlock and his fingers in the guy's nostrils  pulling his head back. 
[03:01:00]  Pulling the head back?  Yeah.  Then you click on all his other photos and it's all just shit like that.  And they delete my MySpace, but this psychopath still has his friends.  Tearing people apart.  Because he's not Master P.  So what's the new MySpace account?  Did we give the...  It's actually the same one, MySpace slash Robert Kelly Live.  I put the same one back up, but now I've got to figure out what the hell to do before  they delete it again.  I almost wanted to turn in everybody I knew.  So everybody...  Nobody had friends.  Being in the same boat.  Yeah, I wanted to track Billy, you... 
[03:01:30]  I wanted to get Dane...  Imagine Dane's account getting deleted.  What, has he got, like, a million...  He almost has a million people.  You've got to give it up, too, for being that fucking honest.  I was so mad.  Because you know what?  I had it before everybody.  You know what I mean?  Not you, Bill.  Are you saying you invented MySpace?  Well, not you.  Who rocked it?  Not anybody in this room.  So what you're saying is you started before all of us and we all passed you?  Well, yeah.  You guys actually...  Yeah, that's usually...  That's the one thing about MySpace that sucks. 
[03:02:00]  You can see where you are in this business.  Yeah.  I saw you.  You and Norton just flew past me.  I was checking in to see where you were at.  Oh, you flew past me, too.  Five on the morning, I got Bobby.  I know he's checking my shit.  The guy's got the easiest job ever.  All of you flew past me.  Yeah.  That sucks.  I think I'm paranoid.  It's just funny.  I think he's listening, because I think I'm paranoid by garbage.  This is six in a row so far.  He's got to play something.  He's got to come back and talk.  It's been a half hour of music. 
[03:02:30]  Well, good.  If that means he keeps playing music, he'll get fucked when I'm playing the stupid Oreo  commercial, right?  Keep playing the songs, rebel.  Come on, Saucy Dave Rossi.  You're getting us there, Diamond Dave.  Pretty good strategy if people are on to us playing it, because then it's like, wow,  they're just playing music.  Which means he's listening to satellite radio.  Right.  Which means he's listening to satellite radio.  Aren't you, Dave?  Somebody is, unlike your quote here. 
[03:03:00]  Unlike his quote.  Which was, hey, did you hear what Opie and Anthony did on the radio today?  Nobody did.  Satellite radio.  It's awesome.  I think Dave heard.  I think Dave did hear.  I think Dave listens a lot.  Someone's listening to Dave.  All right.  Hey, John in Utah.  What's up?  Yeah, you need to do a little game we used to call Midnight Office Renovation.  The boxes, pack up everybody's shit, disassemble the cubicles and stack them up in the middle 
[03:03:30]  of the room.  Sounds like a lot of work.  That sounds like a day job.  That's work.  That's like a second job.  That's work, but it gets rid of the...  The little section you want to harrap.  That's not half as funny as Punch in the Asshole.  We're going to have to give up on Dave Rossi, I think.  No, we can't.  Keep him in the background.  I got to hear him now.  Well, Steve is coming in here with our new game, Coming or Going. 
[03:04:00]  Coming or Going.  You want to play that before we get out of here?  Yeah.  Where's Steve?  Steve?  Steve?  Steve, we need you.  We want to play Coming or Going, the first ever bit we ever did on XM Satellite Radio.  After our two-year absence.  Thanks, sweetie.  Hi, Steve.  Hi.  Oh, wait.  I'm kidding.  You have a...  Oh, there's the disc.  No, you don't give us the answers.  I don't give you the answers.  They don't play his intro music anymore.  I love that.  That was actually pretty good, bro.  Yeah, I got one here. 
[03:04:30]  All right, all right.  Oh, look.  He's driving by.  Oh, here he goes.  He's going to land.  And.  Oh, look.  He took off again.  All right.  There he goes.  There he goes.  96.  Steve?  Yep.  Good to see you. 
[03:05:00]  Thank you.  How are you?  Oh, you're leaving it running just in case you're going to leave?  Yeah, just in case.  We know it.  We know it.  Dave.  Sorry.  Did you ask it?  Oh, is that it?  Is this over?  Dammit.  Let's see here.  Performance anxiety.  Oh.  I'm going to turn it right here.  I'm going to have Bojangles.  Defined.  Gotta.  Is when you've got to have some Bojangles. 
[03:05:30]  A craving for that one-of-a-kind taste of our famous chicken and biscuits.  What's that?  Wanna.  Is when you don't really gotta, but you just really sort of want to have some Bojangles.  Need-a.  Is a much stronger feeling than gotta or wanna.  And is that really passionate craving you get for Bojangles, chicken, and or biscuits.  Ganna.  What year is it in the South?  About how much you need or wanna Bojangles.  And actually get up off of your butter and get some.  And finally, proper.  Is the end result of get up.  And you actually get up to have some. 
[03:06:00]  Or in other words, you get to eat.  Of course, usually in the case of Bojangles, all of these things happen together very quickly and in this order.  I want you to have a Bojangles.  The two-piece meal deal.  Two pieces of chicken.  One six and a buttermilk biscuit.  Whites only, please.  For a limited time.  Regime.  This is my luck.  Black people will be fire hosed.  Hosed and bitten by German shepherds.  Bojangles?  That's Bojangles.  It is Bojangles.  Thank you for listening.  This station is in a commercial break and will be returning to its regular programming shortly. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, what a pussy.  He played a half hour of music and went right into commercials.  He knows you listen.  He knows you listen.  Is that an internet feed?  What a pussy.  Oh, and the internet feed doesn't, they block the commercials out?  But that was him?  Was that Dave Rossi doing the Bojangles chicken read or something?  No?  No?  No?  Everyone's saying no.  No.  No?  No jangles.  Ben shaking his head means nothing to me.  I need confirmation.  Ben is like shaking his head, but it's just Ben.  Someone's got to monitor the station because we can't spend another half hour listening to crappy music. 
[03:07:00]  It's free music.  Oh, yeah.  Free.  All right.  We're going to play Coming or Going.  Steve, you want to explain this game?  Yeah.  Okay.  The premise behind it is basically, you're going to hear a clip and you're going to try  to figure out if it's from a horror movie or if it's from a porn movie.  Because every once in a while you'll stumble across a porn movie that will have some screaming  orgasm in it that sounds maybe like somebody's getting killed.  And you'll come across a horror movie where someone is being killed and it could be mistaken 
[03:07:30]  for somebody having an orgasm.  Right.  So, is the person coming or going?  Get it?  See?  Okay, wait.  Could you explain this again?  Okay.  There are sounds that...  You're stupid, Bill.  Yes.  Little too...  I hear you, Bill.  Little too complicated for you, Bill.  You really don't get it?  Shut up, Ramon.  I'm sorry.  So easy.  I was... 
[03:08:00]  All right.  But in some cases, we've taken audio and maybe added some music to it.  Ooh.  Twist.  Exactly.  I love a twist.  Okay, you've camouflaged some of the clips.  Some of the clips may be camouflaged.  Haven't you, Steve?  Haven't you, Steve?  Because quite frankly, this bit sucked the first time we did it.  You jazzed it up to hopefully save it, right?  Hopefully.  Hopefully.  It took me a year to find enough audio to do another version of it.  All right.  You ready?  Bob, you ready to play coming or going?  I'm ready.  This was one of the features, Opie, that was on our show when we were on the premium service. 
[03:08:30]  That's right.  So you even had to pay extra extra to hear quality bits such as coming or going.  That's right.  We figured that they had to pay extra.  We had to actually write bits.  Right.  So they didn't have to pay extra anymore.  We didn't have to write bits anymore.  That trick never works.  All right.  Should we play the first one here?  Yeah.  All right.  Here it is.  Coming or going.  Okay. 
[03:09:00]  Okay.  This is going to suck.  You just added horror music to an orgasm.  Yeah.  It was totally coming.  Yeah.  You could tell she was terrified.  Oh, yes.  Right there.  Oh.  That's...  When she's getting killed, do you add...  Music to the background?  That's...  Fucking an orgasm with West Side Story playing in the background.  I know.  The next person will be like, get away from me.  That was a softball. 
[03:09:30]  That was a softball.  That's Max Hardcore.  That was a softball.  So this is coming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We know.  Of course it is.  You can hear horror music.  You can hear the horror music from 1962.  Fucking Steve.  It's like from the stock horror movie sound effects collection.  He went to his production music library. 
[03:10:00]  They came to me...  What part of the horror movie...  What part of the horror movie was that?  This motion picture will thrill you.  All right.  All right.  Let's see what the next one is.  No one will be allowed to enter during the last ten minutes of this feature.  Maybe this is like, who wants to be a millionaire, where it's ridiculously easy.  It's going to gradually get harder, right?  Maybe.  Maybe.  All right.  Here's the next one.  Maybe it'll continue to suck.  Rated M for mature. 
[03:10:30]  Ready, Steve?  Yes.  Here's the second one.  Coming or going.  Coming or going.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  See, I don't know. 
[03:11:00]  What was going on?  All right, what was it, Mr. Schmarch?  Oh, shit.  All right, all right.  I'm thinking, have you tricked these up a little bit more than just add music?  Did you add skin?  I'm not saying.  Skin slapping against the skin.  You had the guy's bracelets jangling in the background.  Now, this is good.  This is good because he could have done other things, I'm thinking, which is looping a sound a little bit,  make it sound a little longer, add some other audio to the background that might confuse you. 
[03:11:30]  So this really isn't the game that he described.  It is.  The actual person is what you're listening.  You must get rid of the distractions of music and other sounds.  Yeah, but if you expand the duration of the screen.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't.  I did not alter the screen.  What was that?  Okay.  I didn't alter the duration.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just correcting you because you're wrong.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  So you have to just listen to the girl streaming.  Listen to it.  Listen to the game.  Right.  Everything else could be mirror. 
[03:12:00]  Yes.  Smoke and mirrors.  Could be smoke and mirrors.  All right.  No, you didn't say that.  Okay, you didn't say that.  Did you, Steve?  Actually, I did, but I...  By the way, after today, this bit is going.  But now I'm kind of liking that you're throwing in a curveball.  All right, well, what is it, guys?  It's so bad, it's good.  That's what I'm saying about this bit.  I'm saying this is going.  This is going.  A girl being murdered in a horror movie.  I'm saying it's coming.  You're saying coming?  So the guy...  Bill?  I'm going with my gut that she's... 
[03:12:30]  My initial even...  He called me up to the smarty.  Are you, Bill?  I'm going to say...  Don't steal my bit.  This is my bit.  Everybody's bit now, Opie.  This is my bit.  Isn't it, Opie?  All right, Ed said what?  I said going.  All right.  Bob?  I said coming.  Bill?  I said coming.  Opie?  I don't feel like playing. 
[03:13:00]  All right, fine.  I can't be bothered.  Opie folds.  I'm just going to push buttons and help you out.  All right.  I appreciate it.  We're playing a hacky hold'em.  Bad bit hold'em.  All right, Steve?  What's the answer?  That's going.  Ah, there you go.  You guys are wrong.  Yeah, but you know what, Ant?  What?  Let me just say something on that one.  What?  He kind of gave it to you.  I mean, me and Bill just stuck to our guns because that was our initial thing.  I analyzed it a little more.  He analyzed it.  He gave it away with the, his tell was, huh?  No.  Mr. Smarty Pants. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, he gave it away.  Exactly.  And we stuck.  And that's why we got it wrong.  Yeah.  No, actually, I thought you were going to go, um...  I thought you were going to go the other way.  Hello.  Oh, yeah, MySpace?  Hi.  Yeah, now, my name's Anthony.  I want to report, uh, Robert Kelly, the prick, sore loser, coming and going.  You know, I was within my rights to say going.  And here it is.  I love how his initial reaction of having something bad happen to him on MySpace was to destroy 
[03:14:00]  all his close friends.  Yeah.  I know what I'll do.  Wait a minute.  Why do you assume that you guys are my close friends?  I don't know.  All the touching times we've all spent here.  Punch in the ass game.  The punch and the choke in each other.  Even when we don't call it a game.  All right.  Here it is.  Here it is again.  Going.  She's being killed.  Oh, God.  Don't keep this out of my way.  You're trying to be by the way. 
[03:14:30]  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What's the name of the fucker?  What is it?  Is that out of shit?  What's the name of the background?  That's a movie called Murder Said Pieces that Norton turned me on to.  It is so graphically violent.  Oh, great.  Basically, it's a no happy ending portrait of a serial killer.  All right.  As opposed to the happy endings of a serial killer.  Well, there's no good guy, basically.  There's no good guy in the movie.  Well, you know what?  That one tricked a lot of people out there. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  So, maybe there's something to this game today.  There might be.  And maybe not.  Okay.  Ready for the third one?  Hope's not even playing.  Not at all.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's on his radio show.  And he's like, yeah.  I ain't playing.  I'm done.  I ain't playing.  You guys have fun with this one.  All right.  Ready for the third one?  Of course we are.  Here we go.  This is what I do for the game.  I just push this.  Don't tsk the sounds the second they start, Bob. 
[03:15:30]  You know, you can't.  Bob's like, ah!  She said, eat my pussy in that one.  Could have been a wolf creature.  Yeah.  You don't say yeah when you get stabbed in the gullet.  She didn't say yeah.  But she kind of did.  All right.  Well, what's your answer then?  Mine ain't.  Mine's coming.  Of course it's coming.  It's coming.  I would say coming.  I can't believe I'm cheating off Bobby Kelly.  It's coming.  You're all right.  Yeah, of course.  There's the next clip going, my vagina.  That's so funny. 
[03:16:00]  You didn't just play that one?  No, that was a...  Well, I'll just give him the answer.  Over old fucking Nosferatu organ music.  Yeah, I thank Danny for making me change the fucking music on that one.  I was playing it for the interns yesterday to try to see how many I tripped up, and then  he said, no, no, no, you've got to change the music to, you know...  That's the old Nosferatu organ music.  It was from John Carpenter's The Thing, and I'm never following his advice. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, no.  Nosferatu.  All right.  I thought it was Vincent Price.  Are we ready for this?  Here's the fourth one.  Yes.  That's a good drumbeat in that one.  All right.  What are you saying?  She got killed on that.  You're saying going?  I'm saying she died being fucked.  It was coming and going.  There was no coming and going.  There's no coming and going.  I think it's... 
[03:17:00]  She was getting killed.  All right.  It's just obvious.  I'm saying coming.  Anthony, you're correct.  Yes.  See?  You guys are cheating.  I'll tell you something.  Bob Kelly can't take anyone just fucking winning.  How did you figure that out?  Tell me.  Tell me.  I want to know your process on figuring that out, Anthony.  I'm listening to the way she sounded.  Anthony, listen to us, and you gave too much thought to that one.  See?  That keeps gripping you up.  It's harder than you think.  Mr.  The second that clip started, Bob went, ah, he tisked it. 
[03:17:30]  And now you feel embarrassed.  Don't you, Bob?  That's fun.  I want to play that game.  All right.  So this is what?  Coming?  That's coming.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And I'm not going to reveal my secret, because then you're going to use it.  You're so competitive.  To do what?  You really are.  What?  To do what?  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  To decipher whether the girls are coming or going.  Really?  Yeah.  Like in a hotel room?  Do you plan on, like, staying in a hotel listening to the wall with a cup?  Look, I understand in the scheme of things this might not mean shit, but it's what it is right now.  It's all I've got.  It's a competitive game, and there's even a score being kept by Opie.  I know, but I messed up the score.  This isn't a fun, hey, this isn't a little league 2006 where no one scores, and everyone  wins at the end, and every retard gets a trophy.  We're competing here. 
[03:18:30]  Who admits that they messed up the score?  Opie.  I have two colleges.  You wrecked it.  Ant's got two.  Ant's got two.  Just say yes.  Ant's got two.  All right.  How many you got?  I got two.  I don't know.  Two?  Three?  You do not.  I got two.  Holy shit.  I got two.  I got a bastard.  I got two.  I got two.  I'm only, like, one behind him.  I had, like, four.  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  No.  Ant, how many did we do?  You've done four so far.  Ant has gotten all of them.  Wait, then I have three. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, Ant's in the lead, then.  No, I have four.  I've done four.  I have four.  Well, one doesn't count because you gave him a clue, basically.  I have four.  You gave him a clue, dude.  I did not.  Yeah, why are you singing?  Why is your voice squeaking?  I did not.  I did not.  Oh, God.  I swear to God, this is my game, and I played it the way I made it.  Jesus.  I made it.  Ryan game.  Listen, man, you cheated.  I'll tell you why one has to be taken back.  Why?  No cheating.  Because what you said, this is what I said.  All I said was, oh.  When he said, let me just say, you said, oh, what he said, something like, you really? 
[03:19:30]  You think it's that one?  You basically winked at him.  No, I did a fucking wink at him.  I didn't wink at him because I thought.  And that could have been another diversion.  It could have been.  You have no idea the game I'm playing right now.  It was the first one he did.  Look, man, you guys admit, first of all, you guys didn't know each other longer than me,  Steve, and Billy know each other.  It's not Steve as a background to having orgasms.  Is it fair to say Anthony has one more than me?  I have one more in the game.  He's gotten all of them so far.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, he did.  He got the first one. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  He got the second one.  Actually, I got four.  Then I got five.  Billy, you didn't do five.  It's not that.  It's actually that.  I'm not ahead of him.  You are not.  Billy, Billy.  I am ahead of him.  Billy is ahead of him because the fact is.  You motherfuckers are teaming up against me.  That's right.  No, listen, Anthony.  Honestly, he is ahead of you by one.  No, he's not.  If you took that one.  You got like three wrong.  You cheated.  I did not.  No, you didn't get three.  You got one wrong.  You did cheat once.  I did not.  You cheated.  I saw him play it back.  Play it back to tape.  All right, Bill.  You can hear Steve go, oh, really? 
[03:20:30]  And then he always said, Anthony, Anthony, she's dying.  You know, you could hear the tension between Anthony and Bill.  I was just doing angry typing, guys.  Another one of Opie's bits.  How are my bits being highlighted to that?  That's good.  That showcased.  Stealing them.  Stealing is a compliment.  I have one more.  Let's say hi to Nick the Trucker.  Nick?  Yeah.  Nick?  Nick.  You really can't hold it against Bill because I really don't think, I mean, Bob Kelly, because  he hasn't heard many girls come. 
[03:21:00]  So, I don't think you can hold it against him.  If it was crying over me, just keep holding it against him.  Sir?  This is when you know a joke bombs.  You say the punchline, there's no laugh, and then you go, so.  What I was trying to say there was.  That wasn't the end of the joke.  The rest of it is.  That was just the setup.  Shut up.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  That was.  Why did the chicken cross the road?  To get to the other side.  So, he could get some provisions for when he went back to the head house. 
[03:21:30]  And because...  How are we going to settle this?  That's the same thing as the rich boss.  We're running out of shit.  When he tells something and then goes, yeah, um...  So, anyway.  So, anyway.  Let me take a sip.  All right.  We're going to move on to the next one.  So, is it fair to say Anthony's in the league?  I'm one ahead of you.  Anthony, you're not.  You got all of them right, Bill?  You have not.  No, you didn't.  You got the last one wrong.  All of them.  No, no, no.  You got the last one wrong. 
[03:22:00]  You got the last one wrong.  You got the last one wrong.  You got the last one wrong.  You got the last one wrong.  I got it wrong.  I got it wrong, Anthony.  Show it on the scorecard.  Me.  I got it wrong.  He got it right.  You two picked the same one.  Anthony, I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm not buying into this shit.  I can't believe you're doing this.  This is what I do.  Anthony has four.  Bill has three.  Bob has two.  That just sucks.  I'm not going to sit here and listen to you two.  I just lost my MySpace, dude.  Fuck it's all.  I'm winning.  It's winning.  Let's go to the fifth clip. 
[03:22:30]  It's winning.  It's coming or going.  Coming.  Coming.  Come on, fucker.  Come on.  Professional fucking coming or going, dude. 
[03:23:00]  Can I hear it again?  No.  We can't use it in a sentence.  Just to Stay One Ahead of You.  Coming.  Oh.  I think it's...  What are you going to bet a dollar?  Why don't you just go fuck yourself, then?  Why don't you bet a fucking dollar?  I will.  You price is right fucking nag.  $4,601.  Coming down the aisle in a house coat.  I'll bet a dollar on the refrigerator. 
[03:23:30]  You know how fun?  This game does suck.  You non-competitive jackass.  Oh, yeah?  Winnings the game.  That was...  Jesus.  Going.  That was...  Oh, you got...  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  But you both said coming.  I said going.  You did not.  You did not.  You did not.  Lying sack of shoes.  I said going.  No, you didn't.  He said going.  Dude, are you lying to me, Anthony?  Dude, play it back to Tate.  Anthony, are you psychotic?  Yeah, I am, but that's beside the point.  Anthony, no, we didn't.  You both said the same thing. 
[03:24:00]  You both said coming.  Everybody said coming.  Everybody said coming.  He said coming.  I went like this.  And then I went going.  Yeah.  Did not.  Play the Tate back, dude.  Play the Tate back.  Shut up.  Play the Tate back.  Here's...  It was going, right?  That was going, then.  I was going to stay going.  I was going to stay, too.  But I'm still coming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So it's still Anthony, four, Bob, two, Bill, three. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  What kind of people are they?  One behind Bill.  That's what they call them.  Just...  So I'm too...  Now he has to go first, so he can't fuck you up with that Price is Right.  Oh!  That last one shouldn't count, then.  Here we go.  Let's count.  Here's number six.  Yes, it does.  Oh, no!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Hey, don't you... 
[03:25:00]  Hey, I play...  He goes...  The second they start, he goes, ah, this guy's there, and he's the lowest scoreboard.  You know what, though, Anthony?  That might be my fucking technique.  I might be trying to throw you off, so let me play the game the way I play it.  How does that sound?  It isn't.  Maybe he's saying that's what he's doing, but it isn't.  He might be bluffing.  I might be bluffing.  You never know.  I'll say that was going.  Oh, Jesus.  You're wrong.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Bill?  What?  I got to go next.  I'll go next.  You want me to go next?  Yeah, I'm going to bet you dollars.  I say coming.  I said going. 
[03:25:30]  Fucking asshole, that's what I think.  I think it's going.  I got to stay with me.  Can I change mine?  No.  No.  Wait a minute.  Who are you, Anthony?  You're not a judge.  Shut up.  You're a player.  I said no.  All right, Opie, whatever.  Don't be so rough.  Don't say anything.  You didn't like this bit, either.  Oh, because I was me, you fuckhead.  You sounded like my second stepdad.  Hey, stupid.  I said no.  All right, let's go.  It actually turned into a good bit, and you didn't like it. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  I love it now.  All right.  All right, what is it?  That was going.  Going.  That was going.  Anthony gets a point.  That's right.  And Bill gets a point.  And look who falls further back.  Mr. I-know-what-everyone-is.  Did you ever think that maybe I'm letting you in because it's your show, and I don't know  how to get bummed out for the day?  The Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  This was going.  This was going.  Why did I do that?  Because you're like 20 games out of first.  All right. 
[03:26:30]  That's bullshit.  Let's go to number seven, all right?  Coming or going?  Is she having an orgasm, or is she getting killed?  Look at Anthony really trying to figure it out.  You know that one.  Yeah, the guy first got to go first.  No, I don't have to go first.  Now we go to Bill goes first.  Why do I got to go first?  I just went first. 
[03:27:00]  It rotates.  And then it went him, and then it's you.  No, no.  He went first the last time.  All right.  But I went second.  Play back the tape.  It's Bill.  And I was coming.  You got to take a chance.  Bob.  I'll say coming, dude.  I, too, will say coming.  Of course you will.  You're all right.  And we're all right.  No tisking that one?  I did tisk that one.  You did?  Yeah, well, I mean.  Anthony, five.  Bill, four.  Bob, two. 
[03:27:30]  You can hear the money shot in that one.  Oh, can you?  Here's the next one.  That's two.  Here's the next one.  Wait a minute.  What is Anthony, Hopi?  Huh?  What is Anthony?  I have five.  How many left is there?  Three or four.  All right.  So I'm depending if we could, like, move on with the fucking game.  If you really rally.  All right.  So basically shut up and play the game, stupid.  Let's push this stupid bit through.  Here's number eight.  Deliver this retarded child.  This is good radio.  Really.  Push the button. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, this fucking guy.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  All right.  You're going first.  No, Bob goes first.  I swear to God, I was thinking about my MySpace account.  Is there any way you guys could fucking play that back?  No.  No.  No.  Now you got to go.  I'm not.  Why do I?  Can I just go second, then?  You're not going to win.  Just fucking. 
[03:28:30]  Jesus Christ.  You only have two, Bob.  Every person in my life, Hopi.  You're not going to win.  You're never going to make it.  Be a hairdresser.  Listen, I say.  Let's go generic tracksuit.  What are you going to say?  Oh.  Jesus.  Fuck.  I'm going to just turn into one of your Stress Factory gigs.  It's going to be at Stress Factory.  I know.  That's why I said it.  To kind of give him a plug and a fucking dig.  That was a multi-purpose.  I like that.  You covered all bases there.  Did you, Ope? 
[03:29:00]  Go, Bob.  Listen, I don't even know what that game is.  I say, I guess, going.  Going.  Don't write down my shit, Steve.  Until I say it.  What did you say?  I'm keeping track.  All right, all right, all right.  Now the judges are fighting.  Holy shit, Eric.  I'm taking a little bit of a chance here.  Uh-oh.  I'm saying coming.  No.  Bill, you can finally.  Yeah, I got to go.  I have to say opposite him.  It's the last one.  Yeah.  Going.  Steve?  Going.  Yes!  Yes! 
[03:29:30]  Billy!  Oh, shut off, Bob.  I'm on Billy's side.  Bob, just shut up.  Billy's the one that actually,  we got a tithe now.  Hey, dude.  And just because you're so far behind  and he tithes me  that you got to throw shit at me,  he didn't even throw shit at me.  This is going.  Listen, don't get mad at me.  I thought you were trying to bury something  with so much sound  that you were trying to trick me. 
[03:30:00]  Anthony, five.  Bill Burr, five.  Bob, two.  Three?  I got that last?  You son of a bitch.  Give me the third one.  I got the last one.  You'll get nothing in like it.  What are you fucking talking about?  I just wanted to hear you.  I got three, right?  I get three.  No.  You got two.  You got two.  We go to nine.  We go to nine.  Could this be the last one?  How much show we got left?  Please stop.  I'm defending us.  All right, it's to Anthony. 
[03:30:30]  That's too obvious.  Say it then, obvious.  Yeah, say it.  Come on.  Coming.  Bill?  Is this the last one?  Yeah.  Maybe.  We might get one more in if you.  Well, I'm not going to just fucking throw it.  No, don't throw it.  Coming.  All right, good.  Bob?  Well, the cough threw me off. 
[03:31:00]  Bob?  You got nothing to lose, dude.  All right, I'm going to say coming.  You got to go opposite.  All right, opposite.  Okay, fuck it.  Why am I listening to you?  I'm now coming.  Nope, too late.  You said going.  I didn't say going.  It never came out of my mouth, you fucking jackass.  But how are you ever going?  All right, you know what?  I'll say, all right, going, going.  I say going.  Okay.  Going.  What is it?  Going.  Yes!  I won!  I knew it.  Yeah, that was a strangulation scene.  Are you serious? 
[03:31:30]  Bob, you are so bad.  I got four.  I got four.  The right answer had to be fucking handed to you.  Oh, really?  I had to be handed.  Oh, really?  We have a minute left.  We have a minute left.  We have a minute left.  We have a minute left.  This is going.  She's getting killed.  This sounds like coming.  All right, I get the last one.  It doesn't sound like he's choking.  No.  Wow, that's a tricky one.  Punched through the face.  That's a...  Listen, we got a minute left, so maybe we can get a winner here. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  Choking or while he's fucking?  This is coming or going?  Here we go.  No!  No!  No!  Bill?  Wow!  That's quick.  That's a good one.  Going.  All right.  Bob?  Going.  Ant?  I got to try for the win.  Coming.  Holy shit.  Uh-oh.  That's not like you.  I got to try for the win.  I think he might win.  I'm all in.  That's coming.  That's cheating is what that is.  Anthony just won? 
[03:32:30]  I won by one, my friend.  This girl is coming.  Wow.  She's not getting killed.  She's having an orgasm.  Listen.  No!  No!  No!  Get the fuck out of here.  That's what movie?  That's a movie called Forced Entry.  Of course it is.  You sick fuck.  They were playing punch the ass game.  Yeah.  The whole premise was a simulated rape movie.  All right.  Listen.  We're out of here.  Bill Burr.  Wait a minute.  She's getting raped.  She's not coming.  She certainly was.  Coming is a sex movie.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[03:33:00]  This is a sex movie.  This is a sex movie.  This will be a company show. </pre>
