<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with sexually suggestive sound effects and dialogue, immediately setting the tone.  Jim Norton is a guest in the studio throughout much of the show.  A significant portion is dedicated to debunking a factually inaccurate biographical sketch of Opie and Anthony that appeared on the WCKG (Chicago) and WYSP (Philadelphia) websites.  The hosts reveal that a mutual friend, Steve C, is responsible for the misinformation, and they discuss the inaccuracies with callers.  They also promote their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" (WOW) sticker event and discuss upcoming appearances in Dallas.  A “Mom-Mom” contest is also mentioned.

Movie reviews of *The Animal*, *Evolution*, and *The Contender* are interspersed with anecdotes about incompetent movie theater employees and experiences with people with disabilities in service industries.  A substantial segment replays audio from a previous show featuring "Stalker Patty," a 46-year-old virgin, and Ron Jeremy.  This audio documents Patty retrieving U2 concert tickets from Jeremy's pants after placing a $20 bill in her panties; the search for the money in Jeremy's crotch is described as including sounds of both distress and enjoyment, with the hosts using the term "rape" to describe the audio, despite Patty's reported enjoyment.  Listener calls reacting to this audio segment follow, many expressing amusement.

The show heavily features a listener contest titled "Moms I'd Like to F," with extensive, sexually explicit discussion of its parameters and numerous caller interactions.  A caller recounts an accident delaying their arrival at a WOW sticker event, leading to a digression with Earl from the show's team.  Another caller engages in a conversation about entering the "Moms I'd Like to F" contest.  The show also previews an upcoming interview with Mike Tyson.

A segment focuses on a *Maxim* magazine interview with Mike Tyson, with the hosts reading excerpts and providing humorous, often crude commentary.  The interview details are graphic, covering Tyson's prison experiences (including descriptions of violence and sexual assault), his luxurious lifestyle, his Bengal tigers (and his habit of punching them in the genitals), his medication (Prozac and Zoloft), and a detailed account of punching his ex-wife, Robin Givens.  The hosts mimic Tyson's voice and mannerisms.  Other topics include a discussion of a supposedly disabled veteran who faked a wheelchair theft and further discussion of the "Moms I'd Like to F" contest.  Several callers contribute to the conversation.  Advertisements for Planet Java iced coffee and Sobe Beverages are aired.  The show concludes with a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featuring caller jokes and inside references.  A song from Anthony's band, "Drown, Cuban Drown," is played at some point during the broadcast. A segment features audio from a previous "Nutcracker Suite" where men were kicked in the groin by women.

[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour. By Opie and Anthony. Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW. New York.  Hey!  Come, come!  Get it, get it, get it!  Come here!  Come on, boys!  Come, come, come!  Oh, boy!  Fight it! 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, suck it!  Daddy, can I come, too?  Don't forget to swallow.  Hang over, baby bub.  Uh-uh!  Yeah!  Nothing's better than a busty!  Oh, okay, terrific.  Mmm, take it in my mouth!  Yeah, suck it!  Hey!  Come! 
[00:01:00]  Come on, come on, come on.  This tastes so good.  Hey!  Hey!  Bend over, baby bub.  Hey!  Hey!  Come!  Hey!  Come!  Hey!  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  Don't, don't, don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Hey!  Oh, stop.  You're getting me all excited.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  That old gag.  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Oh!  Damn you! 
[00:01:30]  Shut up, Jimmy.  Damn you!  Okay, terrific.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey!  A little taste of tantric breakdown.  It's, oh, it's a, and Jim Norton in the studio once again today, Anthony.  Of course.  He's our pal.  We might have an announcement as far as Jim Norton goes one of these days.  It concerns the virus.  The virus has spread today, Jim.  We are now being heard in Chicago. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Hi, Chicago.  On WCKG.  Nice.  Toll-free number, 877-692-1027.  We are the latest in the long line of ass-wipes to invade your airwaves.  Opie and Anthony.  Now we're on in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.  Mm-hmm.  I was looking at WCKG's website.  Yeah.  And they're welcoming us to Chicago.  And they wrote a little bio about us.  Yeah, I saw the bio. 
[00:02:30]  Jesus.  They got everything wrong.  Well, you can go to WCKG.com to read it for yourself.  But I can read it, Ant.  And you can comment as we go along here.  Mm-hmm.  They go by Opie, a.k.a. Greg Hughes, and Anthony, Anthony Cumia.  And they both grew up on suburban Long Island in the 1980s, listening to Howard Stern and WNEW.  One of them was in radio for most of his career.  The other held down jobs in roofing and air conditioner.  I never did roofing.  You never did the roofing? 
[00:03:00]  First mistake.  You want to count the mistakes in this?  Yeah.  The other held down jobs in roofing and air conditioner installation before entering the wonderful world of radio.  Wonderful.  Opie comes from a family whose siblings are named Darren and Quinn.  What the hell?  Who cares?  I'm one of seven.  I'm one of seven.  They picked out two brothers.  Opie claims they were all named after classic TV entities.  That's true.  I wasn't.  I just happened to look like...  Oh, Opie?  No, I just happened to look like Ron Howard when I was 12 years old. 
[00:03:30]  And I've been cursed with the nickname ever since.  Right.  But my brother Darren, yes, was named after Darren Stevens from Bewitched.  And my brother Quinn from Quinn Martin Productions.  How about Greg from the Brady Bunch?  Or were you born before that?  No.  I was born before that and it had nothing to do with the Brady Bunch.  Opie went to Harborfield High School, the same high school Mariah Carey attended.  Ooh.  Thrill a minute there.  I'm captivated by this bio.  I went to the same high school as Mariah Carey.  And he then ventured to SUNY Geneseo College. 
[00:04:00]  Did you venture or just go?  I just went.  It was the only college that accepted me.  It was the only one I applied to, I believe, at the time.  He liked the party atmosphere so much, he settled there for five years.  One year above the average.  Wow, the radios must be all tuning in to you.  This is just a great story.  Scumbag bio, that's awful.  While there, he worked at their college radio station.  After college, he had radio gigs at stations in such cities as Buffalo, New York.  Before landing at WBAB in Babylon, New York. 
[00:04:30]  Where he hosted the Opie show in prime time.  How about that?  We'll be back with more.  This is Opie and Anthony beyond the glory.  Beyond the glory.  Anthony comes from a Sicilian family.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  The Sicilian family.  Yeah, I'm from the Gambino crime family.  Doesn't it sound like that?  Well, it comes from a Sicilian family. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  No, I'm Sicilian, half Sicilian, half Nobileadon.  It's just, I don't know, you put a Sicilian family, it's the first thing they put.  I'll have this guy whacked, whoever wrote this.  He graduated from John Glenn High School.  Wrong.  High school dropout.  Try again, dumbass.  The same high school, Boomer Esiason.  Esiason, hell's right.  Wrong.  I went to school with Boomer Esiason, the quarterback of the Jets and the Bengals. 
[00:05:30]  And I went to elementary school.  Right.  Out on Long Island.  Not John Glenn High School.  No.  Ant liked to call Boomer by his real first name and received the royal ass whooping at the hands of Boomer as a result.  Okay.  I'll give him that.  While Boomer went on to college and eventually the NFL, Anthony was a self-proclaimed tin knocker.  Self-proclaimed tin knocker?  They don't even put a background on that.  I installed air conditioning duct work. 
[00:06:00]  That's what I did.  They called them tin knockers.  It wasn't self-proclaimed.  I proclaim myself tin knocker.  The knocker of tin.  He's standing there with a big bell.  Yeah.  Hear ye.  What a bunch of crap this is.  Can you tell the Boomer story again, please?  Timber Point Elementary School.  East Islip, New York.  Elementary.  So you were only 10 or 11, right?  It was, yeah.  When you fought Boomer Esiason.  I think it was like 8 or 9 or something.  I don't even know.  And, yeah, he was, you know, one of those gym rat guys. 
[00:06:30]  He was a gym teacher's pet and stuff.  He was playing football in elementary school.  And he wanted everyone to call him Boomer.  But his name was Norman Esiason.  But if you called him Norman, he got all pissed off.  So the best way to get back at him, because he was just a real prick in school.  The guy would go around the lunchroom and, like, grab people's heads and stick them by his ass and just fart.  And he was big enough so he could, you know, get away with that.  So one day he's walking down the hall.  He's going, hey, Norman, Norman.  And he found out it was me.  And after school, went out and wanted to fight me. 
[00:07:00]  So I put on a big, heavy coat.  I didn't take my coat off.  So I figured it would pad the punches.  So I thought, I better get a punch in.  So I punched him square in the forehead, right in the forehead, and cracked what they call the ulna and radius in my arm.  The two bones in the forearm just broke.  So there I am now with a broken arm.  And I got the first shot in.  And he just proceeded to pummel me.  Boomer was off of the Zoloft. 
[00:07:30]  And he was trying to kill y'all.  And then he bit my ear off.  Yeah.  So he kicked my ear.  That's it, though.  It wasn't John Glenn High School.  I went there.  I hung out.  I smoked a lot of weed at John Glenn.  But graduate?  No.  See, kids, you don't have to graduate high school.  Kids leave school now.  Right.  Get into the wonderful world of radio.  Follow your dreams.  Right.  In the summer of 1994, Anthony went to the WBAB studio to perform a song on the Opie show called They're Gonna Electric Shock OJ. 
[00:08:00]  Eventually, based on that, Opie and Anthony would join forces and form a new radio show.  So that's what they got on the WCKG website about us today.  The last paragraph is right.  But most of the stuff in there is wrong.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, this dumbass story is on WYSP.com now for about two weeks.  What?  Wait, we got this right.  Wait, the WYSP website has the exact same bio?  Word for word.  Aw, there's so much more we can tell, folks, than that. 
[00:08:30]  That is a horrible bio.  All right, thanks, Kevin.  You're welcome.  All right.  Nobody wants to hear where people went to high school.  They want to hear what hole you've got in a girl to stick a wiffle ball bat in.  Right.  That's more interesting to a listener.  Yeah.  Where's that bio?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, wait, this is interesting, too.  Keith, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, it's not even the YSP bio.  That's Steve C's bio of you guys, word for word.  Steve C from foundrymusic.com has the same bio, a good friend of the show. 
[00:09:00]  Who wrote that?  Yeah, go to foundry, go under, I think it's the facts thing, you know, the frequently  asked questions.  Right.  And it's like, it's got the history of Opie and Anthony, everything word for word, how  you, how Anthony, you were doing the air conditioning and the whole bit, and how you submitted the  song to Opie, and that's how you got in, and the whole bit, it's word for word, right  from Steve C.  All right, but all that is true, but Steve C, now, who takes care of foundrymusic.com,  who wrote the Opie and Anthony bio? 
[00:09:30]  Joe Soprano did.  Oh, my God.  Is it the same bio that's now up on the Chicago website, the Philadelphia website?  Is it?  I haven't seen the Chicago website.  Joe, did you F up?  Let me see.  Let me see.  Actually, my family, over the weekend, I went out to see my family for Father's Day, and  they were saying that one of them punched up a website, and that was the bio on it, and  they're going, Sicilian family, what?  I don't know, I didn't write it.  Check your facts.  My God, man. 
[00:10:00]  All right, let's go to Jeff.  Steve writes the bio.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, you know, I'm checking out the Steve Dahl show.  I understand you guys are going to be on today.  Yes.  What's going on?  What's the animosity between you two guys and him?  I mean, they're talking about you guys a lot, and talking about how you guys are going  to tank on your first day out.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that's what they all say.  We met Steve Dahl in Boston about a year ago, and he was nothing but nice to us and pretty  much kissed our ass, so.  All right, well. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know.  If he has a problem with us, tell him to call our show.  We'll talk about it.  Well, why aren't you heard live?  Huh?  Why aren't you going to be heard live here?  We're going to be on in Chicago 9 to 1 a.m., because that's the only slot they got  right now.  All right.  We'll see what happens in the future.  All right.  Well, good luck, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  If we get a buzz in Chicago, they'll move us down.  I know they will.  Sure.  All right.  Yeah.  He was all nice to us and everything.  Yeah.  I mean, open invite.  Steve, if you have a problem with us, call our radio show.  We'll talk to you.  Sure.  I'll talk to you right now. 
[00:11:00]  Right?  Also on the WCKG website.  Yeah.  In Chicago, they have the WOW sticker.  Yeah.  This is the first market we're going into where we can tell people who invented WOW.  It's kind of nice.  Invented.  We invented WOW.  Of course.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday is something we started in Boston.  We've brought here to New York, and we've been doing it for about six years now.  And other jocks all over the country feel like, you know, they should do it in their  city.  They've embraced it. 
[00:11:30]  So now with this syndication thing, it's kind of nice that we can tell people the real  deal, that we came up with Whip Em Out Wednesday, the greatest radio promotion  ever.  You put the WOW on your vehicle, and girls see it, and they feel compelled to pull out their  breasts and show you as you're driving home.  Correct.  It's a wonderful concept.  And all these stations we're being syndicated to, they're making their own WOW stickers,  so the listeners of our show can put it on their cars, and hopefully they'll see something  on the way home from work.  Right.  And you almost forgot the abbreviated version, woo, if you've had a mastectomy.  Oh. 
[00:12:00]  Let's go to Chuck.  Chuck, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Doing well.  When's Wires P to make these stickers?  I had to go in Foundry Music, and there's a variety of WOW signs that are coming up and put  in my back window.  Because YSP's not making nothing yet.  Oh, that's not true.  I talked to Karen down there in Philadelphia, and they're making up WYSP WOW stickers for  you guys.  We need them sooner than they're making them.  I'm trying to go on the website and get one and put it on my window myself.  But see, what's cool about these new cities, you guys should do what we started back six 
[00:12:30]  years ago.  You just write WOW on your car.  It works just as well.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Until you get the stickers.  Well, it's on Foundry Music, too.  They have a whole variety of different WOW that people send in.  It's really nice.  If you want the official WOW bumper sticker, you can just send a self-addressed stamped  envelope to the station, and we'll make sure we get out some WOW stickers for you.  That's what I was wondering.  We can do that from totally?  Yeah, without a doubt.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  All right.  The address is 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Just write Opie and Anthony and WOW sticker on there, and we'll send stickers out to you.  Self-addressed stamped envelope would really help us out with that, all right? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Can't foot the bill.  Let's go to Joanne.  The station.  Joanne, what's going on?  Oh, not too much.  I just wanted to say welcome to Chicago.  Oh, thanks, Joanne.  I've been listening to your show for the last couple minutes on hold, and it sounds great.  Oh, look at that.  I'll tune in for the whole thing tonight.  Oh, cool.  Have you ever heard the term dump the fat man before?  Dump the fat man?  Yes.  No, why?  I was just curious.  That's a common slogan around these parts regarding the afternoon guy on CKG, so. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, Steve Dahl?  Yeah.  Dump the fat man.  I like that.  That's kind of funny.  So, I just wanted to let you know that's the consensus out here, so.  All right, Joanne.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thanks for checking us out today.  All righty.  All right, man.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey, man.  I heard you guys, you know, you don't go to college?  What do you mean?  You're just saying you dropped out of high school?  Opie went to high school and college.  I dropped out.  It's too bad, man.  You go to college for drugs. 
[00:14:00]  What's better than that?  Is that why you went?  Hell, yeah.  Yeah.  Four years.  That's right here.  Right in New York at Wagner College.  I've attended some great college parties and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I just didn't want to bother with all those classes and stuff.  I've got to get some girls all drunk and just, you know, walk around with them.  So what do you got for the show today, Nick?  Nothing.  I'm from Philly, you know.  I just want to say you guys are doing pretty well down here.  Oh, thank you.  You sound very high, dude.  No, I'm at work, actually.  I've been sitting on the phone for 40 minutes on hold. 
[00:14:30]  Well, it says on the screen you want a WOW sticker stop in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  We really should send Earl, like, next week, just as a goof.  Yeah, I'm going to put both of them on in New York, too, because I do a lot of traveling up there.  We'll send Black Earl there.  Cool.  And he'll probably miss it and end up in Chicago, which would be cool, too.  Yeah.  The guy can't drive anywhere.  He gets lost.  How did you guys get to Chicago before anything else?  I don't know.  Every week we're going to be in another city.  The virus is starting to spread all over the place.  I think next week we say hi to Dallas.  O&A, worse than AIDS. 
[00:15:00]  Dallas.  I don't know if they can handle this stuff down there.  We'll see what happens.  Thank you, Nick.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  We are doing a WOW sticker stop today, Anthony, at Victor's House of Music.  762, Route 17 North in Paramus.  They love us up there in Paramus.  Starting at 5 o'clock today with Black Earl.  Get the official WOW sticker for your ride, okay?  Absolutely.  All right.  Moving on with the radio show.  Yeah.  Anthony, you were talking about what you did over this weekend? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, well, you know, Father's Day weekend and stuff.  Went to the movies, but I saw two of the big bomb movies out there.  I didn't go to see Tomb Raider.  Yeah, but I'm hearing Tomb Raider sucks.  Everyone saw that.  Ox.  So I saw The Animal, which I was just like, I will never see this, but I ended up in a  movie theater somehow, and it was playing.  And what's the other one?  Evolution. 
[00:16:00]  The Animal, I was pissed at myself for laughing a couple of times, because I hate Rob Schneider.  I hate his movies, but I was laughing a couple of times, mostly when he got hit in the face  and whatnot, and I think that's what really made me laugh.  He's jogging down the road, and some old guy comes up, and he's jogging.  He's got weights in his hand, and he kind of hits him in the face.  And I'm laughing, because Rob Schneider just got hit in the face.  And Evolution was just a complete waste of time. 
[00:16:30]  David Duchovny, I don't know, between just going on chick flicks, he made a couple of  those chick flick movies, and this bad version of Ghostbusters.  It's what Evolution is.  Just stick to the X-Files.  I don't know why the guy doesn't do like eight billion more seasons of the X-Files.  Why would you go to either one of those movies, though?  I don't know.  It was all that was playing at the time.  I drove out to Long Island.  It was late.  So I figured I'd drop in there.  And it just reinforced my whole thing on movie concession people, too. 
[00:17:00]  The most retarded people are movie theater concession people.  Can't take it.  And you know what pisses me off?  They hire retarded people, but they don't have the, what do you call that, the retard  look?  The turnip bald head.  Right.  Like, at least you know what you're dealing with.  When you walk up to a counter, and you see, you know, a mongoloid or something behind  the counter, you know to give them that benefit of the doubt.  Hold on.  I've got to back you up, though.  What?  Because you went to a McDonald's a while ago. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And someone with Down Syndrome.  Down Syndrome girl.  Waited on you, and you said it was perfect service.  I got the best service ever.  Perfect service.  Because she's like programmed.  You know?  They put a little program in her, and she sticks to the script.  Can I take it all down?  I'm like, all right.  You know, number three, supersize it.  Supersize it.  Yeah.  Coke?  Yeah, Coke.  Boom.  Everything's right there.  You know?  That's all she knows.  That's all she's got to know.  The only problem is you lose your appetite looking at that dumb face.  Jesus.  And I'm afraid any drool might get on my fries. 
[00:18:00]  But other than that, I got prompt, courteous service.  But you go to the movie theater.  You walk up.  Here's a kid that looks like, I don't know, guys I went to school with or something.  And then they're like, have a nice day.  Like, holy jeez, they're retarded.  It's like when you pull into the gas station and the guy looks American as apple pie.  And you ask for direction.  You don't look foreign.  But these guys, the movie concession people, at least if they looked retarded, I would accept it. 
[00:18:30]  I'm standing on line 20 minutes.  And they can't move any slower.  The worst employees ever.  Movie concession people.  Never, ever different.  I'm on a break.  Get the popcorn.  And it takes them forever.  You want bad?  But the popcorn.  Just drool in it a little.  Fine with your drool.  You want nachos? 
[00:19:00]  You want nachos?  You got the little pretzel bites?  You want cheese?  Or mustard?  Jeez, you don't even look.  You don't have the retard face.  Joe, what's going on?  How you doing?  You've got to tell us what theater you are at on Long Island.  There's so many on Long Island.  They're all like that.  You've just got to let us know which theater it was.  Can you do that?  But Comac Multiplex.  Oh, why do you even bother going there?  Because it was local.  I was around that area.  What, do you have a death wish?  Yeah, I was going to say.  Any gunshots while you're there?  Hey, let me tell you.  I hadn't been back there in quite...  I think the last time I went there was many years ago. 
[00:19:30]  And I pulled up and all of a sudden...  What happened to that area?  Oh, it's absolutely horrible over there.  Comac used to be...  I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm walking in and going,  Where am I?  I hope that screen's made out of Kevlar.  People like firing off a few rounds at the screen.  I've got to tell you the movie I saw this weekend.  The Contender.  I rented it.  Oh, God.  Awful.  I was yelling once again at my TV.  I haven't seen a good movie in over a year. 
[00:20:00]  I haven't seen a good movie.  I have the worst luck.  I'm at Blockbuster.  I see the Contender.  Siskel and Ebert, or whatever they're called now.  Siskel and the...  Roper or...  Ebert and the Live Guy.  Yeah.  Ebert and the Live Guy.  Yeah, there's another...  Because Siskel's dead.  Siskel's dead.  So it's Ebert and Roper, I think.  Yeah.  They gave the Contender two thumbs up.  They're usually pretty good.  And what movie is that?  That's the one where the vice president dies.  Uh-huh.  Jeff Bridges is playing the president. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  And the vice president dies,  and now they've got to get a new vice president,  and they want to pick this lady.  Oh, a woman, and it turns out she's got a sordid past.  Right.  And the sordid past is that she, in college,  was part of a gangbang.  Nice!  A gangbang?  Gangbang.  Gangbang.  And they show this real hot piece of video where she's kind of on the rotisserie.  Why?  Was it videotaped?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, so they had a video of this woman.  They had a videotape of her head in some guy's lap,  and some guy, yeah, behind her. 
[00:21:00]  Putting her on the rotisserie.  Nice.  Putting her on the rotisserie, playing cards on her back.  And, uh, basically the movie, uh, goes, you know,  they wanted to, uh, you know, confirm her for the vice presidency.  And, uh, they, they look into her past,  and yeah, this, this whole gangbang was going on.  But she doesn't want to take any questions from the press about her personal life.  Yeah.  So they're just attacking her past, like,  you're a slut, you're a hoe, you did this when you were in college.  And she doesn't even want to acknowledge it,  doesn't even want to talk about it, okay?  They even went as far as to say, you know, 
[00:21:30]  rumor has it that you came out of a room at this frat house,  covered in, oh, covered in byproduct?  Covered in byproduct.  Sexual byproduct.  Because she was in this huge gangbang.  All right?  And the movie goes on.  Blaze donut.  And you're sitting there going, well, she obviously is going to fight back.  She never fights back, because it, you know,  someone in a political office shouldn't have their past discussed, okay?  Turns out, at the end of the movie, she tells Jeff Bridges that it wasn't her. 
[00:22:00]  It wasn't me.  The footage they had of her.  It wasn't me.  And the still shots.  She goes, you know, I have a huge birthmark on my thigh.  I could have proven that it wasn't me.  But it's no one's business.  Me too.  And this is what pissed me off, because now I'm sitting there going,  the whole public thinks you're in a gangbang,  and you left this room with all over you,  and you're not going to defend yourself.  Not realistic.  You know what that is?  That's a bunch of liberals, like, saying how bad it was to attack Clinton.  That's all that is.  Of course. 
[00:22:30]  In a movie form.  Yeah.  And I'd vote for a chick that was in a gangbang.  Wouldn't you?  Of course.  You're all whores.  Acknowledge it.  It was completely ridiculous.  Yeah.  Do not rent the contender.  What a crock of ass.  Not based on reality.  A lady's not going to defend those charges that she was in a gangbang  and walked out of a room with blank all over  when she knows for a fact it wasn't her and she can prove it?  A year it's been since you've seen a good movie.  It's been a while.  What about Memento? 
[00:23:00]  Memento was really good.  I forgot about that one.  What about Chocolat?  I didn't see Chocolat, you dick.  Faggy.  Hey, Faggy.  Oh, I saw Blow.  That was good, too.  Blow was good?  Rick was the one who saw Chocolat.  Rick.  Let me turn your mic off for that.  I'm not saying a word.  Oh, Chocolat.  All right, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All right.  Contender, Blow.  Yeah, and don't bother with the animal.  That Colleen from Survivor is in the animal?  Yeah.  She plays the love interest. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, we know that.  Yeah.  We were supposed to have her on the show and we passed.  She's, you know, she's cute and all.  But that acting, she's more believable in that lip balm commercial she does.  You know?  You're watching her trying to act her way through this movie.  It's just horrendous.  Right.  And you can tell they cut up her scenes like they just told her three words at a time and  that's all she had to do.  And then they cut and different angle, three more words.  Because she probably couldn't get more than three out of her mouth. 
[00:24:00]  And her kiss and Rob Schneider was just like, ugh, we have to see this.  They have a love scene where, you know, they finish up and then they cut back to him laying  there kind of semi-naked.  Ugh.  Hey, who wants to see that?  It's Rob Schneider.  Awful.  Awful.  They should have combined that with the contender and had her walk out with gunk all over.  That would have been nice.  Now that would have been hot.  Yeah.  Spunk, always good on a girl.  Always.  Especially in the face and eyes.  All right.  And we're just getting warmed up. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  On the way, we got some great stuff.  We're going to start a new contest.  Yeah.  For moms.  Yeah, a lot of people criticizing us all the time that we're so preoccupied with teen girls.  Well, we are.  Yeah, I'm not ready to deny that.  But we got a mom-mom contest.  We'll give the details next.  It's going to be pretty cool.  Also, right after break, everyone was talking about it all weekend long.  Friday show, we had Stalker Patty in here, 46-year-old virgin, never had sex whatsoever.  She was in studio with porn legend Ron Jeremy. 
[00:25:00]  Ron Jeremy.  And we made Stalker Patty go down the front of Ron Jeremy's pants for U2 tickets.  Yeah.  And then it got crazy after that because then she had to win spending money for the U2 show  because she doesn't make any money in her life.  No, she's always broke.  And we got to play some of the audio from Friday.  It's un-effing believable.  Yeah.  And the pictures of Stalker Patty and Ron Jeremy are up on WNAW.com.  But we'll replay some of the audio next.  Maybe get Patty on the phone because she went to the U2 show.  See what she thought of that. 
[00:25:30]  Okay?  Great.  And as we go to break, something from the ONA archives.  We like to call this the Nutcracker Suite.  A bunch of guys came in to get kicked in the nads.  Yeah.  Just heaved with the ladies.  We had them in the studio.  And they would kick these guys hard right in the crotch because they liked it.  Castrating horse.  Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection.  All right.  I guess he's ready to be kicked.  He's ready to be kicked. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, no.  This is just wrong, man.  Oh, how did this degenerate into this?  He is on his knees.  He is chained to the bottom of the chair.  His stuff, as it would be, is a little too prominent in those bikini panties.  Girl panties.  He put on his sister's, his little sister's panties today.  Isn't that cute?  She's putting a thing in his mouth to bite on.  Panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, I didn't know. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, those are your panties?  Spike.  Yeah.  She's got the whip, too.  She's bending his head back, straddling him, and she's whipping his body, his tummy and lower region.  Yeah, that's got to hurt.  That has got to hurt.  Oh, that got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  Look, he almost fell down.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  If he wasn't chained up. 
[00:27:00]  Spike is comforting him now, F.  Spike's comforting him.  Did you see him flinch?  And he hasn't been kicked yet.  That was just the whip.  He's lining up.  Oh!  Oh!  He just buckled over.  He just doubled over in pain.  He's breathing really heavy.  I have never seen anything like this.  She's lining up again.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, he's flinching. 
[00:27:30]  Ow!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right, Paul is still on his knees, and Ellen's going to start kicking now.  She's been done wrong by a lot of guys.  Here she goes.  She's lining up.  Ow!  Paul goes, you didn't even make me flinch.  And then she kicked him.  And then she went for it.  He's flinching now at the drop of a hat. 
[00:28:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh, that was a good one.  That, he almost fell over.  Oh, look, look.  He's running a wolf, I think.  You all right, Paul?  Oh!  I just hope I get a seat on the subway.  Are we ready for contestant number two?  I'm a little scared.  I'm ready.  All right, I guess we're ready for more of this.  I would miss this for the world.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh!  That was the right one, though. 
[00:28:30]  I'm going to need some water, Sue.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  This is not right!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Spike knows she gets you hard.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  I can't take any more!  Oh!  That was a bad one.  I can't make this one.  That's a flash.  Is that me or the camera?  He's seeing light. 
[00:29:30]  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  This isn't right.  I got a shot of that on the video.  That will make you cringe.  All right, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up. 
[00:30:00]  She just gave him three quick shots.  She gave him three quick shots.  Grandma gave him three.  All right, hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  I'm with Grandma.  Grandma is pretty good.  You missed, Grandma.  He's down.  He's down. 
[00:30:30]  He's down.  You don't call Grandma like that.  Come on.  Grandma is a good shot.  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him?  Someone's got to put a stop to this.  This is just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us.  Yeah.  Ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  He's a person of masculinity.

I just want to tell you, I was in Philly last week.  I'm in New York.  Yeah.  And we got on, there's a little tourist bus that does a loop around the city, and the guy had your show on.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  That's very cool.  He said he was very excited, and he wants you to come to a WOW sticker stop, because he wants to put a WOW on his truck. 
[00:33:30]  Feeling the love.  We're going to be down in Philly sooner than later.  Well, my husband and I ran around in Philly taking pictures of the WOW sticker in front of, you know, like the Liberty Bell and stuff.  I want to thank all the people in Philadelphia.  Unbelievable email coming in so far.  We've only been down there a week and a half on the radio, so thank you, everyone in Philadelphia, listening to us on WYSP.  All right, Stacy, thanks.  Thanks.  Hey, earlier, talking about that lousy movie, The Animal, I saw.  Yeah.  A couple of the funniest moments were Adam Sandler's in it at the end, a little bit, and Norm MacDonald. 
[00:34:00]  You know, probably the angry mob.  So that was funny.  And Adam Sandler, I'll just wreck it.  I don't care.  I don't know how many people have seen it or not.  But at the end where Rob Schneider's got to do something and achieve something, or there's a mob of people around him.  And Adam Sandler's in the crowd with that little hat on going, come on, you can do it.  The part that Rob Schneider was doing in, what movie was that? 
[00:34:30]  Little Nicky?  Uh, no, in, um, whatever.  Yeah, I don't even remember.  But he's doing the exact part that Rob Schneider did in his movie.  They're all a bunch of whores for each other.  Yeah.  Also in the studio, Jim Norton.  Jim, you have a good weekend?  Uh, yeah.  Ozzy.  Nice.  I have to, by the way, I forgot.  I have to say happy Father's Day to my father a little late.  I called him, but he wasn't home.  And I'm sorry I didn't come home yesterday. 
[00:35:00]  I wasn't, uh, I wasn't kidnapping a 12-year-old by telling her her mother was in the hospital or anything like that.  I just...  You gotta get in the car.  You gotta spend the day with your dad on Father's Day.  I know, I know.  I'm a terrible son.  I'm a, you know, I apologize, Dad.  There's been an accident and your mommy's hurt.  Get in the car with me.  Yes.  Is that what you used to annoy?  That's wonderful.  What happened?  I'll tell you on the way.  I'll tell you.  Just get in the van.  Very good.  Terrible man.  Ah, it was the water boy.  Dan, what's going on?  Oh, man.  I'm in Brownville, Texas. 
[00:35:30]  Someone from New York just called me.  Yeah.  Said O&H just got sent to Chicago in Dallas after this Philadelphia debacle.  Oh, my God.  I creamed in my pants driving to Brownville.  Let me tell you something.  I gotta defend Philly.  They've been nothing but cool so far.  We started in Chicago today on WCKG, and Dallas is next Monday, Dan.  Right.  Well, I drove down to Texas on day one when you got into Philly the first day.  Yeah.  And I wanted to call in and tell them all, listen, stay around for the live reads.  And I'm sitting on hold waiting for a live read. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  Thanks, Dan.  Oh.  See, he knew his call didn't work.  And he went, oh, oh, I screwed up.  We have a lot of fun with the live reads, but only New York could hear that.  Right.  So, Anthony, we gotta go back to Friday's show, because it was unbelievable.  And we got some audio clips of the mess that was going on in here.  Yeah.  Ron Jeremy was in, and we had a couple of U2 tickets.  Right.  Very hot ticket open.  And Patty, who comes on this program, she's a 46-year-old virgin, never had sex. 
[00:36:30]  She says it's because of her religious background and upbringing.  I just think it's because no one would ever.  And she just, you know, she's very shy.  I just never had sex before because I'm looking for the right man.  I don't just want to catch a disease.  I want to meet the right guy so I could have sex with him and not worry about being used 
[00:37:00]  or called a slut or nothing like that.  I need a nice guy that I could meet and maybe go out.  And after six months or so, we could start getting intimate.  But until then, I'm not going to have sex with somebody that just wants to have sex for the sake of having sex.  And just babbles like that endlessly.  That's her.  I know. 
[00:37:30]  So we invite her down.  It's her in a nutshell.  No, here's me in a nutshell.  How'd I get in this nutshell?  So we invite her down to win some U2 tickets.  Yeah.  If Patty's listening, she might as well call the show because we've got to find out how the U2 show was.  Yeah.  So Patty, 46-year-old virgin, was here Friday.  Ron Jeremy was in studio.  We put a pair of U2 tickets down the front of Ron Jeremy's pants.  Let me tell you something.  Stalker Patty has done nothing in her life sexually. 
[00:38:00]  Never touched, never saw live man junk in her life.  She's never touched it, obviously.  And never had anybody touch her down in that nether region.  Never French kissed, nothing.  No.  The only thing she got, she got filled up once by our pal here, Jim Norton.  Here on the show.  To make you horny.  So you've got to understand how sick she is like this because she waited 46 years.  She's been waiting for the right guy to come along to touch her intimately. 
[00:38:30]  And who's the first guy that does it?  Ron Jeremy.  Porn legend Ron Jeremy.  Ron Jeremy.  What a professional he is.  She could catch something just from his rings.  The best, though.  I mean, every girl has a price.  Even Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  We said Patty.  I mean, we should tell everyone.  U2, her favorite band of all time.  I like the edge.  She pleasures herself to the edge.  We got that out of her one day.  She doesn't do it often, but there are a few times we asked her if she lays back and  maybe her fingers start wandering.  Who does she fantasize about? 
[00:39:00]  Because she's a stalker of Opie, really.  So I thought maybe she lays back and thinks of Opie.  But she's so effed up in the head that she said, I can't fantasize about someone with  a girlfriend.  And Opie's got a girlfriend, so I can't fantasize about him.  But the edge I could fantasize about.  I think the edge is married with kids.  But I don't know him.  But he has some kids, too, right?  No?  All right, girlfriend.  But I don't know him, so I could fantasize about him. 
[00:39:30]  I know Opie's girlfriend, so I can't fantasize about him.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'll cave your head in with a friggin' spade shovel.  So as soon as we told her that the U2 tickets were down, Ron Jeremy's pants.  Yeah.  Holy ass.  Oh, she went down there like a champ, like Seika.  Forget about it.  Her hand was right down there.  So we got the audio of her fishing out the tickets from Ron Jeremy's crotch.  Check this out.  It gets better after this, because then we upped the ante. 
[00:40:00]  Patty has never, oh, no, never.  Never.  She's never had any kind of contact with that part of a man in her life.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  Now I'm dizzy.  Now I'm dizzy.  I can't believe it.  I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round.  Oh, you're on a merry-go-round.  You can't be on a merry-go-round.  I can't see any more, please, son.  Okay, the ticket's away.  There you go.  All right.  You follow my voice.  Hello, hello, hello.  Okay.  There she is.  She's on the stomach. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  There we go.  She's now touching Ron's stomach.  Oh, my stomach.  She's going in his pants.  She's going in his pants.  She went down Ron Jeremy's pants.  Ron, how much did she feel?  She glazed along the side of the lawn.  She brushed the side of the legendary Ron Jeremy's lawn.  Here's the bad part.  Oh, my God.  John Tesh at Red Rocks.  She's my favorite fan. 
[00:41:00]  Are you more excited about you two or that you finally touched man junk in all these years?  She's got it right to the side, man.  She's pretty good at that.  I don't think she's a very good fan.  I don't know what I...  I don't know.  I brushed up against something, but I don't know what it was.  It was filet of...  Did she give you a little...  Tell you, it was a pound of beef and a bucket of balls.  She's done this before.  Tell you what we're going to do.  We're going to upgrade your tickets, Patty, to the front row, but...  You want a front row upgrade?  Open wide. 
[00:41:30]  All right, so there's Patty going for the U2 tickets in the front of Ron Jeremy's pants.  Yeah, we realized, though, that the tickets weren't really put in a place that she really had to search for.  So then we decided her second weakness, which is cash.  Because some broker, they make a lot of money.  I work at McDonald's.  They put me on french fries, but now I'm on soft drinks.  So now I'm hoping to get paid more money or I'm going to go to Burger King. 
[00:42:00]  Of course, I'm trying to get a job at the Hard Rock Cafe, but they keep telling me to come back.  And I come back and they never tell me if I got the job, but I need more money.  I'm shooting you.  I'm going to shoot you.  She's so annoying.  So we decided, 20 bucks.  Yeah.  Spending money.  Spending money for the U2 show.  But we would fold it up a little bit and stow it underneath Ron Jeremy's ample yam bag. 
[00:42:30]  Right under the sack.  That famous sack you see swinging back and forth during every bob shot in the porno movies.  The back of the wally shot.  But Patty had no clue it was in that area.  No, she'd never really seen it.  I don't think she knew the dynamics of male genitalia to know that, hey, you could hold  a 20 down there, right?  You could just put it under there.  And now she's going to have to start moving some junk around to get that $20 that I made  so bad. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  These pictures are up on WNEW.com and foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com, so you can play  along at home.  Haywood from Yonkers, if Patty looked like Britney Spears instead of Geddy Lee of Rush,  she would have been banged years ago.  I like it.  Red butt cheddar.  All right, so here.  And the men who hold our places to be the ones to start to mold a new reality closer to 
[00:43:30]  the heart, closer to the heart.  The blacksmith and the artist reflected in the rod.  Forged the creativity closer to the heart.  So, uh, here she goes as she tries to find the cash for the first time.  Living in the limelight, the universal dream. 
[00:44:00]  He's awful.  He kind of does look like Geddy Lee.  Good for Geddy, not good for a chick.  Yeah.  Neil Peart on the drums, everybody.  Neil Peart.  He's one of the best drummers I ever worked with.  He makes a lot of money.  I wish I made the money he made.  Working at McDonald's.  I never touched man junk in my life. 
[00:44:30]  On a lighted stage, approaches the unreal.  For those who think and feel.  Guts of reality be on the guilted cage.  Are you ready to rock, Chicago?  All right, so.  God, I hate her.  So here's Stalker Patty, 46-year-old virgin, trying to find the cash in Ron Jeremy's pants. 
[00:45:00]  The first, uh, the first try at it.  Patty, and 20 bucks to enjoy the night out of seeing you two.  Yeah.  How about that, Patty?  Yeah, Bono.  All right, hold on, Patty.  Patty is now going down his pants.  I don't know, honey.  Her hand is down.  Oh, my God.  She just pulled her hand out.  She pulled her hand out like a ferric pin.  It's there, honey.  It's there.  I swear to God, she pulled her hand out of there so quick. 
[00:45:30]  It's under the schlong.  You'll find it.  Patty, go ahead.  You've got to dig it out.  She thought it was a roll of quarters.  Patty, go get it.  You're too low.  Too low.  I've got to go higher.  Too low.  Go up.  I've got to go higher, honey.  It's underneath.  I swear to God, it's like something's nipping her.  She pulls her hand out of there so quick.  Patty, Patty, give Patty the mic a second.  Patty, it's not going to bite you.  Patty, what are you feeling?  What are you feeling right now? 
[00:46:00]  It scared me.  That's what a lot of women say.  She got a grip on it this time.  Did she?  Patty, what does that feel like?  Weird.  Is the 20 still in there?  Oh, it's still there.  It's still in there.  It's still in there, yes.  All right.  I love this.  She went back and forth like 20 times where she put her hand in, and then she'd eek.  She'd go eek and pull her hand out like a little rabbit or ferret was nipping her, nipping her.  But she didn't get the cash. 
[00:46:30]  No, I couldn't grab it right away.  I didn't know what I was touching.  All right.  Here's the second try as she tries to find the cash in Ron Jeremy's pants.  Now that you've had your hand on it, honey, it's no big deal anymore.  Yeah.  Try the undercarriage.  That's like a second fiddle, honey.  Get in there, Patty.  Let's go for it.  Keep going.  Wait.  You're close.  A little lower.  A little lower.  Wait.  To the right.  To your...  Okay.  Wait.  Wait.  To your right.  Again.  Right.  Other way.  Other way.  Other way.  A little lower.  A little lower.  She's got a hand on Ron Jeremy's pants. 
[00:47:00]  Keep going.  A little lower.  She's killing me.  Okay.  Now curl up a little bit.  It's right there.  Curl up.  She just pulled her hand out again.  She squealed and pulled her hand out.  She makes contact with Fletch's.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  What's going on?  I've done a lot of radio shows in my day.  It just really takes the cake.  I know.  All right, Patty.  46-year-old version Patty.  Patty. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  What's the problem?  No, it's just...  It's called Ron Jeremy.  Yeah.  She's called all the right spots.  Get him.  It's called Ron Jeremy.  All right.  So that was the second try.  Yeah.  Third try, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Stalker Patty going for the money in Ron Jeremy's pants.  All right.  Here we go.  Get it out of the way and that's underneath waiting for you.  This is for 20 bucks so you can enjoy the U2 show.  You got to get it out of the way, huh?  Patty, after you do this, we're going to show you where that's been. 
[00:48:00]  We'll roll a few videos.  You got to go on, Nathan.  You can't escape touching it.  I don't see it.  You got to get the slum out of the way, honey.  Higher, higher.  Go get it, Patty.  Go on.  You pulled her hand out again.  Patty.  I'm going to get lazy for her.  I'll put it right here.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't make it easy.  She's got to get it.  She's scared stiff of the nutsack.  Patty, Patty, you're going to have to lift up where it's hidden. 
[00:48:30]  I couldn't put it any more blunt to her.  I mean, she had to actually get in there.  Lift it up.  They better not be dumping out of this.  We haven't really described what the cash is.  Work them.  You ever see the cane mutiny?  The way Captain Queeg used to work those big metal balls in his hand?  I'll tell you, it's who ate all the strawberries?  How many portions did you have?  Who ate the strawberries?  Old Yellowstain.  Old Yellowstain.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they called me Old Yellowstain. 
[00:49:00]  But I said, we're going to go around.  That's how she's worked.  We went around.  You crossed over the cable, sir.  I didn't cross over the cable.  Strawberries.  Who took the strawberry?  And she's working.  She's got to work those things.  Finally, I think she gets the cash.  Here it is.  I feel like Guy to Harassets.  Stalker Patty.  Going for the cash in Ron Jeremy's pants.  All right, she's back in there, Abby.  She's back in.  To your left.  My left is this way.  Yes, go to your left. 
[00:49:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Now, go underneath.  You're there.  Go a little more underneath.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  You can't avoid it.  Come on, honey.  You have to go underneath.  Come on, grab.  Don't be afraid of it.  It's not going to bite.  Just nibble.  Come on, Patty.  You're real close.  You're really close.  Patty's like right under there.  A little more.  Patty, you've got to use it.  Oh, my God.  She's right in there.  She got it.  She got it.  She got it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  My God.  It's money to all us.  My God.  Dean from PA.  What is the web address where the picture of Stalker Patty and Ron Jeremy are at?  We said it.  W-N-E-W.com.  Foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  We have one more clip to play.  I look just like Geddy Lee if someone punched his teeth out and replaced him with Tic Tac.  Thank you, everybody.  Modern day warrior, mean, mean stride. 
[00:50:30]  Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride.  I got teeth that look like those little chicklets.  I rock.  Look at me.  And his mind is not for rent.  Don't put him down as arrogant.  Because they have a quiet defense running out the day's events.  It's a red bar. 
[00:51:00]  Looks like a mouthful of baby chicklets.  Liz, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  It's Ferris Bueller's girlfriend.  Oh, what's up, Liz?  Nothing.  My smile, all you've got to do, chew up about five pieces of hubba-bubba, mold it into the  shape of gums, and then shove some baby chicklets into it.  That's me smiling.  Hey, Liz.  What's going on? 
[00:51:30]  Nothing.  Listen, I missed the show Friday because I was at the sticker stop.  Flight by night's away from here.  Changed my life again.  All right.  Sorry, man.  What's up, Liz?  Let's start over.  We didn't hear you.  Nothing.  I said I missed the show Friday because I was at the sticker stop, and that is the funniest  damn thing I have ever heard.  Right on.  You guys have done it again.  Hey, thanks, Liz.  Oh, you're welcome, Liz.  All right.  Bye.  Damien, what's going on?  It's Damon.  All right, Damon.  What's up?  I'm going to burn all my Rush CDs after hearing this.  I'm going to burn them all, set them all on fire. 
[00:52:00]  Why are you doing this to me?  It's my favorite band.  Are you bastards ready to rock?  I wrote this one after I burnt myself in the fryer later.  That makes do I know.  I don't know this one.  All right.  All right.  I mean, I don't know this one.  So, so far, she won the U2 tickets by going in Ron Jeremy's pants and $20 spending money. 
[00:52:30]  We figured she needed another $20.  Yeah.  So, this was just beyond horrific.  We had Stalker Patty take $20 and, uh...  Ron Jeremy's taint.  No, she actually, she put the $20 in her...  Down her panties.  In her area.  And it was exactly on the area, like right below.  It was...  Right on the seam of the panties.  It was between the peach and the balloon knot. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Right there.  And there...  And the rule was Ron Jeremy then had to go and get the $20.  And when he pulled that $20 out, she would get it.  Right.  And now here's Ron Jeremy's big, meaty, porno hand.  You know, you could rent to any of the movies or buy any of them, whatever, and see where  that hand has been.  Yeah.  It's been in every orifice that is known to man, woman, child, whatever.  And there it was.  Patty has never had anyone even close to that area. 
[00:53:30]  No.  And the reason, because she says, you know, she's waiting for the right guy.  Ron Jeremy was that right guy?  Ron Jeremy could have taken that $20 in two seconds.  Oh, I know.  How smooth is he, man?  It took about a minute and a half.  And this is some of the best audio you'll ever hear from a 46-year-old virgin.  It was sounds of a rape.  It really was.  It was like she was being sexually assaulted.  It sounded that way.  But she enjoyed it.  Yeah.  God, I wish we could have pulled that off.  That's what I said. 
[00:54:00]  She enjoyed it in the hotel room.  Remember?  Because the girl I was with was screaming just like that.  Of course, I punched her in the face as hard as I could.  And she hit me with the pepper spray.  But I'm impervious to that.  Impervious.  I-P-O-I-P-U.  Imper-  How do I even know the word impervious?  That's what shocks.  Sometimes Mike will shock you.  And sometimes Mike will just punch you in the face until your brain comes out your ear. 
[00:54:30]  I'm full of surprises.  We have a brand-new Mike Tyson interview we're going to get to in a little while.  Yeah, we've got to get to that later.  The guy is classic.  You are not going to believe what he does to his pet tigers.  I love them like they were my women.  Yeah, we'll get to that in a few minutes.  But here it is.  Ron Jeremy going into Stalker Patty's pants.  Yep.  We can say that for $20.  Check this out.  Patty, you ready for this?  All right.  All right, Jim.  Jim, make sure you're Mike Patty.  All right, Ron now searching, going down on the belly. 
[00:55:00]  He is now finding the panty line.  There he goes.  Oh, my God.  Patty is freaking out.  I'm not here yet.  Oh, my God.  Patty can't believe it.  She's in shock.  Ron Jeremy's hand firmly down her pants.  She's buckled over, doubling over, her mouth agape.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever seen Patty like this? 
[00:55:30]  This is unbelievable.  She's like, dude, she's enjoying this.  She just had to know.  I think she just owed.  Oh, my God.  I'm over there.  He's almost got it, Patty.  He's almost got it.  You've got to stand up.  I do it.  I do it.  I do it.  I do it.  I do it.  I do it.  He's almost got it, Patty.  Hey, you're going to U2.  You're going to have $40 spending money, Patty.  I'm so surprised Ron can't find it.  Yeah, Ron. 
[00:56:00]  You can't find it?  I thought you were an expert at this.  Oh, my God.  I think you lost the ring that time.  She's twitching.  She's twitching.  This is one small step for a man.  She's on the floor.  Oh, no.  Did you get it?  Yes.  He got it.  He got it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  That's 210.  She made change.  That's great, Richard.  What's going on now?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Is that great?  That sounded hot.  I like the screaming.  That is great.  That was good.  The only thing missing was the kidney punch and the knockout blow.  That's just the highlights.  We're going to have to replay the whole bit the next time we take off or something because  it was an unbelievable hour of radio.  It actually should have been on a pinball machine. 
[00:57:00]  A lot of people didn't see was to get the smell off his hand, Ron had to shove his fist  into a vomit bag.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Funniest effing bit, man, I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah.  What?  It's got to be the first time in my life I've ever heard Norton disgusted by a sex act.  Yeah, I know.  A guy that likes tinkle.  There he is.  Oh, she is a mess.  Nice pitches.  Oof.  Yeah.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Kick an ass, boys.  Keep it up.  All right.  Ernie O. from Jersey writes, I just tuned in. 
[00:57:30]  Are you guys playing audio from The Accused?  That's what it sounded like.  I swear I was drunk.  They put me on the pinball machine.  Tony, what's up?  Tony.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  That was the funniest bit I've ever heard in my entire life.  No, right on.  Right on.  Okay, Patty.  All right.  I think she's outside.  We'll talk to her next.  See how she enjoyed the U2 show.  Thanks, Tony.  I want to see you.  All right.  All right.  How many can we give away?  We got three copies, Anthony, of Shangri-La-Di-Da, the latest CD by Stone Temple Pilots. 
[00:58:00]  Before you can buy it, courtesy of Atlantic Records.  It's in stores tomorrow, so before you can buy it, technically, by the time we mail it  out and all that.  We'll take three random callers right now at 877-692-1027.  The words of the prophets are written on subway walls, concert halls.  Matt, what's going on?  What's up?  What's up, Matt? 
[00:58:30]  Hey, what's going on?  That goes with the sounds of salesmen, of salesmen, of salesmen.  God, listen.  I was listening to this.  I drive a truck.  Yeah.  God, I was crying.  I was driving.  I was crying.  I was laughing so hard.  Cool.  And the car in front of me, man.  It's just ironic that it was Ron Jeremy, the first guy that touched her.  Yeah, Matt, your phone was breaking out of fun.  He wanted to say that the pictures are just as funny on WNEW.com. 
[00:59:00]  So.  Oh, man.  Okay, how you doing, Philadelphia?  Are you ready to rock?  I am.  I had a hot day today.  They put me on burgers, and I don't know how to flip them, but that's a lot more money  that way.  How are we doing out there?  Look, I'm dancing across the stage.  Neil Perk.  He's wonderful. 
[00:59:30]  Sometimes I fantasize about him.  Not often, though.  Usually it's the edge.  God damn, this is a long musical intro.  How come I always write songs with very long intros?  The day with the friendly nights of the family.  That song, that's so elusive, and I don't know.  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  7.  WNEW is.  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Ron and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.  It's a birthday surprise.  Look, Ronnie, for Mother's birthday, I got her tickets to a Broadway show.  See?  Gee, Fez, these are pretty close to the obstructed view section.  Really?  Where's that?  Any row behind your mother. 
[01:00:30]  Rude and Rude.  Honestly, Fez, tell anyone sitting behind your mom that the name of the play is Fat Woman Eating Beef Jerky.  Because that's all they're going to see.  Mama.  All on the next, Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027.  WNEW.  Rockaway Bedding.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Where do you go for a bed?  Rockaway Bedding.  Of course.  They make it real easy.  You know what?  People don't understand this, though.  I still see people on the road with mattresses tied to their roof.  You know, they go to a store, they pick out a mattress, and they tie it to the roof of their car and try to drive down the road. 
[01:01:00]  Why do that?  Rockaway Bedding.  They got all the major brand-name mattresses.  Sealy, Posterpedic, Simmons, Beautyrest.  Serta Perfect Sleeper.  It prices up to 65% below department store prices.  All the new mattresses, like the Simmons Beautyrest 2001, it's a one-sided mattress.  You don't have to flip it.  Plus, they have the latest in luxury bedding from Stearns and Foster, all at the lowest possible prices.  And they deliver it free.  Free.  They give you a free steel bed frame, free delivery, free complete removal of that disgusting, old, smelly mattress. 
[01:01:30]  That's good.  When I think of the edge, I get my mattress sooky.  Rockaway Bedding's got to take it away, but it looks like a sponge.  When you go to Rockaway Bedding, you sleep better and save money.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  1-800-TRY-A-BED-FOR-ROCK-AWAY-BEDDING.  Opie and Anthony.  W-N-E-W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Call free, 877-692-1027.  Jim Norton in the studio. 
[01:02:00]  Opie, it didn't take long.  On opianthony.com, the message board.  See you next Tuesday.  The guy's screen name.  Made a little picture of Patty Lee or Stalker Getty on her head on Getty Lee's body with the other two guys.  And they look separate at first.  Yeah.  Getty Lee and Stalker Patty. 
[01:02:30]  Patty's outside the studio.  That is a good message board.  Go to opianthony.com.  Keeps you updated.  Whackbag.com, good too.  They get mad when we don't mention them enough.  Let's go to Mike really fast here.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm from Philadelphia and I'm glad you guys are down here.  You guys are the funniest thing I have ever heard.  Hey, look at that.  I love it.  You two guys, actually your whole team is probably the hardest working team in radio.  Because radio sucked until you guys came down here. 
[01:03:00]  Well, we don't do anything.  That's true.  That's why.  Like, I think people work too hard.  We don't do anything.  Well, I like to work the way you guys work.  You guys are the best.  I think.  We're just kind of hanging.  And if any of this stuff sticks, great.  If not, oh, well, we try.  Hey, so far, everything you guys stick.  I heard you guys for the first time last Tuesday.  Yeah.  I almost slammed my car into the wall when you were doing that.  The what's in my pants game.  Great.  The first exaggeration of a car wreck from a Philly.  Yeah.  Cool.  We like the exaggerated phone call.  It was unbelievable. 
[01:03:30]  I was laughing so hard.  Thanks, Mike.  I almost drove off an embankment.  My car flipping over the rocks until it burst into flames.  Almost.  Almost.  It's close.  Yeah, we don't prepare for this crap.  It's funny because a new intern started today.  Yeah.  And she was standing in the office.  And I could just tell.  I could read her mind.  She's looking around the office.  You're playing computer games.  I got my new Half-Life game, which I'm very excited about.  I'm watching the playoff, the U.S. Open thing.  Everyone's thumbing through nudie books.  Over 40 magazine came in today.  Yeah.  I got it right here. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, look.  It came in today.  I'm like, I opened it up.  Yeah, the new intern's standing there watching all this.  I open it up.  I go, up, up, over 40's in.  Boom.  I throw in the magazine.  Well, look at the stain on the cover.  This is a used over 40 magazine.  Look at that.  Seriously.  Looks like Peg Bundy on the back, doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  Peg Bundy.  Yeah, it does.  If she was on heroin.  Anyway, and Rick, in all fairness, he was working a little bit.  Ben was on the phone.  And I could tell.  I'm looking at the new intern.  And she's looking around going, oh, my God.  It's true.  They don't prepare for their radio show. 
[01:04:30]  They just kind of hang out.  This isn't what they teach me in school.  In radio school.  That's a Brady Bunch impression.  I'm not stupid.  All right.  You're on the movie, though.  That's good.  Marsha Brady.  Mark, what's up?  You know, I'm calling from Philly, and I'm trying to get into you guys and not get into  the hype of the idiots here.  But you know what?  Yeah.  If he does Patty's voice one more time, I'm personally going to drive to New York and beat  him with a baseball bat.  We love Stalker Patty's voice. 
[01:05:00]  You're killing us.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Thank you for the call, Mark.  Stalker Patty's in the studio.  Patty.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  How are you?  Great.  You are glowing.  Yeah.  You are glowing.  What did you do to your hair?  Like, it looks like it's got a little more bloody to it.  I used a different kind of shampoo.  You did?  It's called Ron Jeremy's Cream Rinse in its own pump dispenser, right? 
[01:05:30]  No.  Yeah.  You're going to be gravely disappointed when you finally are with a man since the first  guy's junk you had in your hand was Ron Jeremy.  Yeah.  It's just like a penis, only smaller.  Now, Patty, I know you're paranoid of germs.  What did you do after you were in Ron Jeremy's pants?  I don't know.  I was in a daze.  I was holding my ticket.  I hope you didn't go back to McDonald's and start cooking the food.  Oh, no.  Imagine that.  Imagine that.  I just went back to work and stuck my hand in the french fries and gave them out.  Oh, no. 
[01:06:00]  People all over the city eating Ron Jeremy's clear stuff.  Oh, God damn.  No.  Imagine that.  I didn't have time to wash my hands.  Everything kept coming back.  People were saying I didn't ask for extra cheese, but I got it.  Did you scrub good after you left the studio?  What?  Did you scrub nice after you left the studio on Friday?  Well, I had to take a shower anyway.  Yeah, I bet you did.  All right, Patty, how was you, too?  Awesome.  Awesome. 
[01:06:30]  Awesome.  The best show I ever went to.  I absolutely loved the band, and they had, like, so many surprises, like the stage was  in the shape of a heart, and you didn't see it until the middle of the show, and they  put the lights on.  Whoa.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Really?  The video part of it was great.  The lighting and special effects, outstanding.  What kind of special effects, Patty?  Oh, they had a lot of strobe lights, like in a disco, and, like, the soft gels that you 
[01:07:00]  have with the 1960s, you know, whatever.  Right.  You know, like, it was like an experience.  It was really an experience.  So we dropped acid, and I freaked out.  It was wonderful.  I had a bad trip.  Ben was at the U2 show as well.  You didn't notice the heart-shaped stage before they even took the stage?  I didn't even realize it was in the shape of a heart.  It goes to half court.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, they played at the Garden. 
[01:07:30]  It was like the whole court, basically.  It was like the best show I've ever seen, but anything by U2 is the best show.  What was the show you were with, you were at before this one?  What was the last rock show you went to?  Who was it?  I'm trying to think.  Best show I've ever been to.  I've never been to one.  About three years ago, I went to see Collective Soul.  And even though I was 43 at the time, they proved me.  They proved you.  The guys have my case.  Proof of humanity.  That they were wondering. 
[01:08:00]  But I didn't mind it.  I love it when they do that.  And then he said, you must be happy.  And I said, I sure am.  Because if I was going to lie about my age, I wouldn't say I was born in 55, you know.  What else did you guys say to each other?  It's really interesting.  He was just wondering because he said female.  It was a great show.  Do they have any special effects that could make you look like you don't have the posture  of a scrotum?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, Patty, I think your self-esteem has to get a little better where you stand and hold 
[01:08:30]  your head high.  Yeah.  Keep your shoulders back.  There you go.  Yeah.  Just snap her neck.  I've tried it once, but I fell over backwards.  So used to standing like this.  Quasimodo.  Ring the bell, Esmeralda.  All right, Patty.  Thank you.  So you had fun.  I had a great time.  It was worth grabbing Ron Jeremy's junk.  Well, you made me work for those tickets, definitely. 
[01:09:00]  Girls get paid well for grabbing his junk.  Anything to plug?  Well, I'm going to be in a new movie.  I'm a vivid girl.  It's going to be interracial gangbang 16.  No, the only thing I can think of is their next show is in Madison Square.  It's going to be tomorrow.  Great.  All right.  Thanks, Patty.  Haywood from Jersey on the Instant Feedback, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, guys. 
[01:09:30]  When are you guys going to have your best body contest?  That's going to happen later on this summer.  We like to do contests that involve the listeners and the Internet.  Yeah.  We bring girls in.  We had best boob contest, best ass.  Right.  Things like that.  Best whipped cream bikini.  And we put the pictures up on the website as they are taken.  You see them immediately.  And then we vote.  We all get to vote.  You, us, on the best boobs or ass.  And now we're going to have best body.  Well, what we want to start next Monday, though, is a contest before best body. 
[01:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  Moms.  I'd like to F.  Yeah.  The MILF, I think they call it.  Right.  Moms, I'd like to F contest.  Because some of the women that are getting a little older than the girls we usually have  in here get a little pissed off that we don't involve them, except for Patty.  We usually have girls, teen girls, come down.  Teen.  And now we're going to do something involving the girls that are a little older.  Moms, I'd like to F.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:10:30]  That's going to start a week from today.  And it looks like we're going to have a really, really, really good trip.  A really good trip.  Yeah.  To give away to the moms.  We already have a few moms that are coming down here.  And they come down in whatever they want to wear.  Lingerie.  They want to go topless.  That's cool.  Whatever.  Whatever makes you look sexy as a mom.  Yeah.  Hot.  Nice.  Hot moms, I'd like to F.  Contest coming to the Open Anthony show a week from today.  Nothing says hot better than a vag that has just had a huge head gone through it. 
[01:11:00]  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Sure.  Nothing says hot like a, I don't know, an exit that's had all kinds of placenta and junk  just fly out of it like Jell-O.  Ooh, I'm getting all worked up just thinking about it.  Opened and stitched.  Nice.  Nothing says hot like this.  Ah!  Let me see that.  Opie just opened Over 40 Magazine.  One of his favorite publications.  No, it's not.  We're starting in Chicago today. 
[01:11:30]  I don't want them to think I'm that sick right off the bat.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  Look at that.  What, she give birth to a 15-year-old?  That is abused.  It looked like I was punching it.  I try out on a heavy bag, and then I went after this girl's vulva.  V-O-V-O.  All right.  So it's the Moms I'd Like to F contest coming to the Open Anthony show.  It starts next week.  This is how we do the contest. 
[01:12:00]  If girls from Philly or moms from Philly want to come up for the contest, it's cool.  This is what we do.  We have an open-door policy all next week.  Right, Anthony?  Go.  And the moms come down with their lingerie and stuff, and we take pictures of them.  Yeah.  All next week, you could come down between the hours of 3 and 7 here in New York.  And then we put all the hot moms on the Internet, and then the listeners will vote for their favorite mom they'd like to F.  Nothing says hot like a P-Z-O-T-O-T-O-T-O-M-Y.  Lactating babes. 
[01:12:30]  The one breast that's left, just leaking milk.  Oh, my God.  That's freaking Norton, man.  Yeah.  Nothing says hot like one that looks like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  Right?  Just big, hairy mess.  Yeah.  So you don't have to groom it after you've had kids.  The deal is set.  You already got your man.  Just let yourself go.  Let yourself go, ladies. 
[01:13:00]  Who cares?  Nice black eye because she talked while Dad was watching the Yankee game.  It's hot.  It's hot.  Jackie.  Hello?  Hey, Jackie.  What's up?  Where the hell are you?  Daytona?  Jackie.  Me?  No, no.  I just went to a toll booth.  All right.  What's going on, Jackie?  It's Peggy, not Jackie.  All right, Peggy, what's up?  Nothing.  I wanted to do the milk contest.  Yeah?  You're a hot mom?  Yes, I am.  Can you come down one day next week to show us what you got? 
[01:13:30]  Uh-huh.  Sure.  How many kids have gone down that water slide of passion?  Two.  Two?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Describe yourself.  Five foot three.  I weigh about 112 pounds.  And long blonde hair, blue eyes, very full lips.  Quite attractive.  Ah, you forgot the breast size.  Very important to you guys.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Breast size, they're so small, but they're very perky.  They're a 34B.  Nice. 
[01:14:00]  Nice.  That's okay, too.  Very good.  Yeah.  And for someone my age, they look very nice.  We got some really good prizes for the Moms I'd Like to F contest starting Monday.  What day are you coming down?  What day do you want me to come down?  Doesn't matter.  Why don't I come down Wednesday?  Wednesday between 3 and 7.  Just show up, and we'll take your pictures.  All right.  Great.  What are you going to wear for the contest?  I don't know.  I've got several things I have in mind.  I've got this, I have several nice pieces of lingerie, probably something in black, you  know, probably a garter stocking, stuff like that. 
[01:14:30]  I think for this contest, we want to focus on a lot of lingerie, Anthony.  Lingerie.  Lingerie.  They cover up a world of hurts sometimes.  Yes, they do.  Do you want hot?  Three words.

Don't blow us off.  We're going to have a really good prize.  We just can't say what it is because they still have to confirm it, but it looks like  it's going to be really, really good for the moms that like to F contest.

What is this one?  Drown.  Cuban Drown.  Oh, right.  Well, you know, every so often a bunch of flotation devices with Cubans come over.  Hit Florida.  And we had one a few years back.  And my old band, we wrote a song and performed it. 
[01:16:30]  And, of course, you know who wrote a part of this, too?  Our guitar player, Rex, who's a Cuban.  So don't go getting all agitated.  He had no problem with it.  You shouldn't either.  Drown, Cuban Drown.  Drown, Drown.  Drown, Cuba Drown.  Drown, Cuba Drown.  Yeah, Cuba Drown.  Drown, Cuba Drown.  Turn around.  Oh, right.  Oh, right.  Oh, right.

What's up?  How you doing?  Hi  Anthony, what's up with you? 
[01:21:00]  What's the matter?  All you're doing is ragging, ragging, ragging  On women who have had kids  Oh, I'm  Older  No, I'm  You're pushing 40, Anthony  I'm teasing, of course  Eileen  I don't think so  Eileen  I'm teasing  We're going for laughs, Eileen  What?  We're going for laughs  Oh, I know  I laugh along with you guys all the time  I'm worried about it  I like that Kelly Ripper  She's hot and she's a mom  She just had something come out of there  Wonderful, beautiful girl  But, Anthony, why are you so hooked on the age thing? 
[01:21:30]  I'm not  We F around  Eileen, that's why we're having a Moms I'd Like to F contest  Ray, what do you think?  We would do this if we didn't want to?  I am completely looking forward to the Moms I'd Like to F contest  That starts  Anthony sounds like  Anthony sounds like he's doing this under duress  Don't you worry about what I sound like  He's goofing  It's going to be a great contest  Are you coming down, Eileen?

And we got a great prize  We just can't announce it yet  Because we got to make sure  It's definitely going to happen  All right, well, I think Anthony's got to be nice  Otherwise he's going to drive the contestants away  No, he won't  I'll reen it  Well, Eileen might be on to something  Because we only have one girl so far coming down  Don't worry  Okay  It's not just about  There's women come in the studio that aren't hot  I mean, Patty was in here  And she's got the body of a wingless pterodactyl  All right, well, Anthony, expand your horizons 
[01:22:30]  That's all  That's right  All right, Eileen  Okay  Man, all right  You're a girl  Joe, what's going on?  Yo  Hey, Joe  Homer, always funny  Always funny  Always funny  Joe  Yeah  What's up?  Nothing much, man  Listen, you guys, I'm just cruising back from New York City into Connecticut  I own a limo service  And, you know, I just called my wife after I was listening to you guys for a while 
[01:23:00]  And I said, honey, I think I should bring you down there to see these guys  Because my wife, you know, she's 27 years old  So I don't know if that's young for you guys or old or whatever  But she's had our second daughter just five months ago  And she looks  When you're telling these little stories  Here's a good idea  Have a point  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener  All right  Well, what's the age, you know  There's no age thing  It's just moms 
[01:23:30]  Don't worry about it  My God, man  I wish Ron and Fez were still in the building  If they are, come on down to the studio  Because they were listening to our show Friday  When we had Richard Jenny in here  Oh, yeah  And we really  I'm not going to lie  We didn't want Richard Jenny on our show  But Ron and Fez kind of pushed hard  Because they're friendly with him  And I must say  After it was all said and done  Richard Jenny did a great job for us  We had a lot of fun with him  Well, we were busting his kahuna so effing bad  To the point where he just burst into the studio 
[01:24:00]  And he was really, really pissed  He was like, all right, enough of this  We had him on the phone  So then we settled down  And he's in your seat, Jim  And all of a sudden  He goes into a typical comedian schtick  Which we hate on this show  Yeah, we have a lot of comics on here  But we don't like when they just break into a part of their act  We just, you know, hang out and have some fun  Hang out and be funny with whatever we're talking about  But all of a sudden  He starts talking about the internet  And we weren't really talking about the internet  But he wanted to jump into a part of his act 
[01:24:30]  Hey, how about that internet?  Right  So I look right at Richard Jenny  And then I go to Anthony  Oh, Anthony  Here it comes  The jokes  Here comes the funny  And he was just like, all right, no  No, I'm not saying it  And he got all pissed off  He got so effing pissed  And I'm a comic  And I'm driving  I heard that  And I'm driving  And my bag just shriveled  Just to hear that from somebody on the air  And then he got really creepy  And then he gives me this look  And I look at him like  What, what?  I thought we were all just having fun  All cool and stuff 
[01:25:00]  He was pissed  But I knew exactly what I was doing  He was pissed  He was so hateful  I really love it  Anyway  So, no  We're looking forward to the moms coming down here for this  Moms I'd like to have contests  We're just goofing and stuff  If we really didn't want to see it  We just wouldn't do the contest, all right?  And we've had plenty of young girls down here that were slobs  Right  Don't worry about it  Right  Get self-conscious  I find moms very, very hot  Absolutely  Especially when they're pregnant with their second child  Especially my own 
[01:25:30]  Easy  Well, the part  We can say areola, right?  That's a technical term you can say on there  Sure  Yeah  Gets big and dark  And that's very, very sexy  I like that  You like that?  Yeah, I really do  Big one  Yeah, big dark areola  It's like a manhole cover  Yeah, yeah  Nice  Yeah, like the shadow on the wall in World War II  When the bomb exploded in Hiroshima  Right  That's what I like  Just a big chap shadow right on your breast  Do you like the slow fade?  Oh, yeah  I'm a slow fade guy 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, like Tracy Lord almost had that, right?

Big dark ones, yeah  Yeah, like little riveted on ones  Yeah  I don't know  Earl is at a wow sticker stop  Okay, listen  No one in Chicago is going to care  No one in Philadelphia is going to care  But trust me, this is really good stuff  Right, Ant? 
[01:26:30]  Yes, it's Earl  He does our sticker stops  Takes the van out  Goes to a location  And he is devoid of any energy or creativity whatsoever  Right  Whenever he calls into these things  He just brings the show right to a screeching halt  Well, you know, this wow sticker is very, very hot  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday  I want to explain Whip Em Out Wednesday really fast, Anthony  Because Wednesday's coming  And we need to get Philly and Chicago prepared 
[01:27:00]  You put a wow on your vehicle  Somewhere, anywhere  It could be one of the stickers that we give out  It could be a homemade thing  It could be scraped in the back of the dust on your truck  W-O-W  Whip Em Out Wednesday  You drive around  A girl that knows about this promotion  Sees it  Pulls up next to you  Flashes her beautiful, ample breasts at you  Or saggy, small ones  We don't care  Just flashes her breasts  It's as easy as that  Right  That's it  That's all there is to it  We get lots and lots of winners every Wednesday  So if you don't have a sticker  Like Anthony said  Just make the homemade signs 
[01:27:30]  Those work great  Especially in the new markets, okay  And if you want a wow sticker  You can send a self-addressed stamped envelope  To 888 7th Avenue  New York  New York  10106  Or you can see Earl  Who's at Victor's House of Music  762  Route 17 North in Paramus  He's there now  Ladies and gentlemen  It's Black Earl  Earl  Hey guys, what's up?

God, like, taller than a midget  I'm 4'11  4'11  How much do you weigh?  And don't lie or I'll know  100 pounds  You don't weigh 100 pounds?  Yes, I do  Okay  4'11, 100 pounds  32 C  Ooh

Yeah, I know  Ooh  Yeah, we met him once  He was really cool to us  Yeah  Drink out of my mule  I'll introduce you to him  Okay  All right, Pia  Hi, Steve  Oh, my God  Wow  He's got that to deal with  We're going to have to have the Stalker Olympics  What a mental case  Put her up against Stalker Patty  Yeah  Why not, right?  At least Patty's too broke to afford airfare 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, that's good  It keeps her limited to where she can go  This psycho's building frequent flyer miles  Although, if I had to, I'd just stub away in the landing gear  Are you getting a compliment on the grease man thing?  Ron, what's up?  Hey, Ron  Yo  What's up?  Anthony has got to do more grease man  It's amazing  Hey, man  You like to be a grease man  Amazing  How come the grease man didn't go over very well  But when I do it, people seem to enjoy it 
[01:47:30]  Oh, it's crazy  It's awesome  Yadda doodle  All right, we'll hang up  All right  All right, man  Yeah  Grease man's always fun  We've got to pull out a cag  Yeah, we got the latest interview  I think the grease man saved me from a nightmare  Thank you  Well, it's always better to do things in character  Like the grease man did  You know, slinging lead in D.C.  Before I make my racially insensitive remarks  Bone dry  Snarling  Now I'm going to finish off my show with a martini 
[01:48:00]  But it's radio, but I'll pour it anyway  Dopey ass wipe  Okay, we got the latest interview from Mike Tyson  That's right  It's in Maxim Magazine  Should be on newsstands in a couple days here  This guy hung out with Mike for 36 hours in Las Vegas  Says, with the planet's most violent celebrity  And there's just some funny things in this interview  First of all, the interviewee was scared S-list 
[01:48:30]  He didn't know how to go about asking Tyson the really tough questions  Because he was face-to-face with them  Isn't that funny?  Whenever we do interviews, people don't care what the hell they ask us about  Whether it might piss us off or something or make us defensive  I wonder what the difference is  Right  They look at us and go, my sister could beat you guys up  It starts off pretty funny  Because there you have Tyson and the guy that's going to interview Tyson  And it says, sitting in a corner booth at H&H Barbecue  A greasy soul food joint in a mall off the Las Vegas Strip 
[01:49:00]  Mike Tyson is snapping chicken bones with his thick, restless fingers  Splintering the marrow into soft, tongue-moistened shards  So it resembles Linguini  He has the eyes of an executioner  They've locked in on my own  And they're spinning in their sockets like twisters  That's a lunatic  Holy mackerel  Tyson's talking about prison  The years he's done for rape and assault  And I'm jabbing him with little questions 
[01:49:30]  Working nervously and methodically toward the bigger questions I want to ask him  And someone asked the interview guy  What's it like asking Mike Tyson about sexual predators in prison?  And the interviewer goes  Complete terror  I beat around the bush until he catches on  The fighter shakes his head and growls  You want to do this with Tyson?  Yeah, what did he say?  Listen, everyone's pathetic in there 
[01:50:00]  If you think you're tough, you're going to get effed up  They're going to eff you  They're going to cut you  No one is what they appear to be  You meet a guy and he's nice and funny  Then you find out he killed a bunch of kids  Put him in a microwave  You want to put people in the microwave?  I like it, you know, like movie popcorn  You put him in the microwave  Well, I have trouble with my microwave at home  Because of my gold toothuses  I have to hit the button and run away 
[01:50:30]  Because the radiation of the microwave makes my teeth spark  My gold teeth  They start sparking and arcing  Because that's what microwaves do to metal objects  How did Mike know that?  I don't know, but I know it  I know when my teeth start sparkling  Like the 4th of July sparklers  I've got to get away from the microwave  We can't trick you, right, Mike?  You can't trick me 
[01:51:00]  You know everything  That's right  Popcorn  P-A-P  No, no, it's P-O-K  Corns  K  See  See what?  Never mind  I'll see me punch you in the face  If you say Mike can't spell  Alright, so more on the interview  Then he starts talking about his amazing house  He lives in a 10-bedroom mansion  With a gym, a guest house, and a wine cellar  I need that because I don't want the woman I'm assaulting  In one room to hear the other one 
[01:51:30]  That I have just assaulted  Because then they get a chance to run away  And then Mike starts talking about his house  Mr. Tyson, if you will, from your interview  I'm reshaping my house  I've been working hard on turning it into a nice home  I like to do that stuff  I read magazines like Architectural Digest  And Decorating Digest  I want to be an architect  I like Architectural Digest  It's a good publication 
[01:52:00]  And then I eat the cover  And I eat the pages  And the glue in Architectural Digest  Tastes much better than the glue in Decorating Digest  I want to be an interior decorator  But I ain't a faggot  Alright, so then  I am Elmer J. Ford Millionaire  I own a mansion and a yacht  Then the guy interviewing Tyson  You know, finds out about his Bengal Tigers  He has four of them  And it says in this article 
[01:52:30]  We hope to see the fighters for Bengal Tigers  But they're in Dallas with a trainer  Until Tyson finishes his renovations on his brand new house  If they were here  You'd be so effing scared  I think the guy was effing scared  Just being with Mike Tyson  He's got tigers  Yeah, and he says  Leaning against the wall in his kitchen  Next to a row of air freshener cans  When they stand up there like eight feet tall  With heads as big as coffee tables  They like to jump on you and break you down 
[01:53:00]  You'd get your ass kicked  I introduced one to the newspaper guy one time  And he had a heart attack  It wasn't a good interview  Hey, newspaper guy  And then the guy goes  What does Tyson do with his tigers?  And he says this  I punch them in the balls and in their face  It's like punching a cement wall  They like it  I'm like Siegfried and Roy 
[01:53:30]  With our severe mental problems  That's right  You never see Siegfried and Roy  Those two pussies  Punching their tigers in the balls  They might punch each other in the balls  But they like that  I hope they're letting that get through  It's like punching a cement wall  He punches his tigers in the testicles  What are they going to do?  Eat me?  I'll bite that bitch  I don't care  Don, what's going on?  Yeah, man  I want to ask Mike 
[01:54:00]  Whatever happened to his megaphone?  Didn't we always  Wasn't Mike Tyson for some reason  Always on the megaphone?  Yeah  Yeah, that's because  He used the megaphone in England  That one time  Oh, that's  You know something?  I couldn't remember why  Mike Tyson was always through a megaphone  For no apparent reason  He went to England  And people were taunting him  So he grabbed the megaphone  And started taunting him back  Through his hotel window  I totally forgot about that  And ever since  We did our  My aunt did his Mike Tyson  Through the megaphone  Shut up, you limey sons of bitches  Look at your tiefishes  They look worse than mine 
[01:54:30]  You don't have good dental hygiene  Like Mike Tyson  Look at my teeth  T  E  E  F  Teeth  Hygiene  H-I  Gene  Hygiene  Now I punch you  And I punch my tiger in the testicles  He punches them in  Who the hell would want to fight this guy?  The only reason I punch tigers in the balls 
[01:55:00]  Is because there ain't no Tyrannosaurus left on the earth  They were extinct millions of years ago  I believe it was due to the climate change  How do Mike know this?  I don't know  But I know  I would love to fight a velociraptor  I would punch him in the balls  Nothing he could do about it  Alright, so it goes on 
[01:55:30]  And now Tyson talks about his Prozac  Tyson is on Prozac  Apparently a lot of it  Previously the heavyweight had been taking the antidepressant Zoloft  To control his mania  Weaning off of it before his fights  And then the famous quote, Anthony  I got it right here  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all  See, because I would just kill y'all 
[01:56:00]  Actually, I wouldn't kill them right away  First, I'd just walk down the street  Punching people in the testicles  Seeing the face as tough as my tiger  You should see how they have to give me the Prozac  And the Zoloft  Here's somebody giving me some Prozac  Oh!  That one was in the butt  Now I run around for a while  And they gotta chase me  And then sometimes they find me next to a bush  Out in my backyard  And they put me in a cage and relocate Mike  But Mike always finds his way home 
[01:56:30]  Sometimes I wake up and I got a radio collar on me  And I scrape it off next to a tree  And it falls off  And they can't find Mike  To give him more of his Zoloft  Oh, that one  Oh, I'm feeling a little woozy now  Look at me  I'm gorgeous  Watch out  I'm going into a death role  Death?  Death?  That's what I said  Death  I'll punch you to death 
[01:57:00]  Just watch  First in the sack  Just like my tigers  Read this, Mr. Tyson  About the Zoloft and the Prozac  I'm on it  To keep me from killing you all  Right  I don't want to be on it  But my doctors are concerned  The fact that I'm a violent person  Almost an animal  Almost  That's what it says in the magazine  Did I say that?  Almost an animal  I have three less hairs 
[01:57:30]  I'm like Rob Schneider in the animal  Sometimes I'm such an animal  I punch myself in the testicles  To see how pissed I could get me  And then I kick my own ass  I'm taking bites out of my legs  I'm crazy  And then they start talking about  How he wants to be a nice guy now  I always want to be a nice guy  But I get in fits of rage  When they put the little biplanes around me  And try to shoot me off a small building 
[01:58:00]  No, that's not  That's not in the article, Mike  Oh, okay  Yeah, I'm trying to be a nice guy  Right  I'm trying to get my life back on track  I'm on the verge  Of getting your life back to normal?  Yeah  Okay, and then the interview guy goes  What do you mean, Mike?  Listen, I'm crazy  I'm effing crazy  But there's got to be some dignity about me  I'm older now  And don't want my kids to think  I'm a total maniac 
[01:58:30]  I may be  But my children have problems with the teacher  I don't want them to  Mike turns the page  Be scared to come to me  Because I go down  And kick the crap out of the teacher  In the past, I would have  Oh, yeah  The kids have problems with school  He goes down to the school  Could you imagine that?  You're Mike Tyson's kid  You have a problem with mathematics or something?  Why do you give my son a D?  Well, he's not doing his work 
[01:59:00]  Okay, I'm going to punch you in the testicles  And I'm going to bite your ear off  In the past, I would have  But Mike Tyson, it says, is full of love  I love everybody  Black, white, gay, Jew, candy-striped  I don't want to hurt no one's feelings  I'm on the Zoloft to keep from hurting no one's feelings  And from pulling organs out of your nose  Because I would do that  Mike, what do you have to say about your bald head? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, wait, there are more Prozac for Mike  Ooh, I'm feeling good now  It takes the end off  He talks about ladies  And how ladies love his bald head  Why do they love your bald head, Mike?  Girls love bald guys  They like to rub your little head  When you go south on them  Yeah, I think he can say that  Because the bald head on top  Looked like the other one  Only without the gold two-faces 
[02:00:00]  It's insane  Oh, my God  What is this whole thing about being gay?  I know I ain't gay  Are you gay, he asked me?  Nope  Then it must be you, Mike  Wait, who was he talking to?  Who the hell am I talking to? 
[02:00:30]  Wait, back up  What the hell was he talking about here?  They say one of three guys is gay  Mac jokes  His hand resting on Tyson's shoulder  I know I ain't gay  Are you gay, he asked me?  Nope  Then it must be you, Mike  Oh, I guess it's one of Mac's  One of Mike's friends, Mac  Goofin' that  Sean, what's going on?  Sean  Hey, why don't you use the sound effect  The punch  You just forgot to say  If they had a punch  All right, we'll get the punching going 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, it sounds like a pussy  Send it to pussy  All right, Sean, thank you  Why don't you shut up?  I'll punch you  All right, and then they go back to talking about prison, Anthony  Yeah  Go to this section right here  Thursday, 7 p.m.  When you go to prison  Your life is ruined  Tough or not  You learn how to play the game  Right now  Right this second  People are getting effed  People are getting sucked 
[02:01:30]  People are getting beaten and raped  You gotta be one of those crazy mother effers to survive  You gotta join the psychopaths club  I've joined that one  I'm a card-carrying member  That's funny how I say right now  This second people are getting effed  And people are getting sucked  And getting beaten and raped  Because that's all just me  That's all Mike Tyson  Member of the psychopaths club  P-S-Y-C-H-O-P-A-T-H-S 
[02:02:00]  Psychopaths  Psychopaths  Whoever let us put our thing in  And all the man's behind  Behind, behind, behind  Watch him scream  I'm so mean  I'm Mike Tyson  All right  And then finally  Mr. Tyson  You don't know when I'm effing you  Let me tell you something  There might be some prisoners  Years and years and years  After they got out of the joint  If the memory fades  They might forget that they were raped in prison  When Mike rapes you  On your deathbed 
[02:02:30]  You're going  Damn that hurt  And I remember it very vividly  V-O-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V-I-V 
[02:03:00]  F him, I said to myself.  They're watching this right now, and their mouths are watering.  He's like a London broil.  I swear to God.  He's like a prime rib.  I love when a newbie would come in the joint.  Go, Mike, I want to meet you.  I say, okay, bend over.  Fresh meat.  I would administer some Zoloft with my probe. 
[02:03:30]  Sully, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to ask Anthony if he ever gets scared, like he'll see Tyson, you know, around.  But then I remembered, he never goes to the Bronx Zoo.  Oh, Sully.  That's tasteless.  He's a jackass.  I'm just, I wouldn't be afraid of Anthony.  That's why, you know, I wouldn't beat him up.  I'm afraid of that man.  I just want to clear something up.  Anthony does the great impression of Mike Tyson.  Yeah, Anthony is amazing.  No, he don't.  Yes, he does.  I'm hoping.  No, no. 
[02:04:00]  Hoppy, hoppy, hoppy, hoppy.  No, no.  I will punch Hoppy when I see him.  Oh, no.  Anthony does an incredible Mike Tyson impression.  That's pretty much it.  Just some of the highlights of the article.  I like what he says about Alexander the Great.  This is him on history.  Alexander got all the bitches, and they weren't all whores.  Wasn't that Alexander the Great?  I should teach history.  Now, George Washington, he liked a good BJ just like the next guy. 
[02:04:30]  But he got the skanky whores.  You ever see that Martha Washington?  She was a pig.  JFK.  Now, there's a man who could F.  And he was always good to his family because he let his brother Bobby F the same chicks  till his head rolled off.  I swear to God, I could punch someone and make the back of the head fly off just like JFK.  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  I thought I used the T.  That's a good letter.  I should use it. 
[02:05:00]  Larry, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Larry.  For Anthony's sake, I hope Mike Tyson don't like this show.  Because he better learn how to run like Jesse Owens from him.  Yeah, Anthony does a great impression of Mike Tyson.  Shut up, Moppy.  It's unbelievable.  Good luck, guys.  All right, bye.  Did you see the part of the interview when I talk about Robin Givens, my wife?  No.  Back in 1989, she really offended me.  And he punched her. 
[02:05:30]  I beat my former wife, Robin Givens, back in 89.  I went bam, and she flew backwards, hitting every effing wall in the apartment.  That was the best punch I ever thrown in my effing life.  He says that?  He really says that?  That's a quote in the magazine.  Oh, man.  Yes.  Man.  That aunt could take a punch.  Let me tell you.  John, what's going on?  Robin.  Oh, God, you guys are killing me.  Robin. 
[02:06:00]  I thought...  Come here, Robin.  What happened?  Why did you cook my steak?  You know I like it raw.  Shut up.  Her body blows.  Look at her going around.  She looked like a ball in a pinball machine.  Look at that.  Take that one.  Okay.  Don't try spraying me with pepper spray.  I am impervious to pepper spray.  E-M-P... 
[02:06:30]  No, no, no.  E-M-P-M...  It's tough.  It's...  You...  Shut up.  Let me spell.  All right, go.  Impervious.  Yeah.  Q-R...  What the hell does that even mean?  Frank, what's going on?  I hit it so hard, I saw a tilt light over the bed.  Yo, what's up?  Tilt, tilt.  Game over.  Insert another quarter and start punching the bitch again.  Yo, are you there? 
[02:07:00]  Frank.  No, it's Mike.  All right, what's up, Mike?  Yeah, I was watching Damon Wayans on TV.  He was talking about how he made fun of Tyson.  Yeah.  And Tyson grabbed him in a supermarket.  He grabbed him.  And he bit him on the back of the neck.  And he's like...  He was talking about it.  He was like...  I'm biting him.  He's like...  He's like...  Whoa, you're Mr. Funny Man, huh?  How funny are you now, man?  And he's like biting him.  He's like...  He said he fell back in his shoulder like he was his little bee, you know? 
[02:07:30]  He's like...  He's like he didn't know what to do.  Well, I guess we've got to assume that Mike Tyson has a sense of humor  and that he really enjoys Anthony's impression of Mike Tyson.  Actually, I can't do nothing about it, even if I want to.  I got this thing, and they put this wire in the ground around my house,  and I wear a collar.  And if I step over the wire, it gives me a jolt.  It keeps me from getting hit by cars when I chase balls across the street.  It works. 
[02:08:00]  The neighbors are very happy.  I bit the bumper off a Jaguar the other day right in my neighborhood,  and I could have been injured.  John, what's going on?  Where are you getting this article from?  There's no way he talked about Punch and Robin Givens like that.  I don't only talk about it.  I said it was the best punch I ever did in my infant life.  It's fairly human.  John, pick up the latest issue, the July issue of Maxim Magazine.  You can read that part for yourself.  That is real. 
[02:08:30]  That is horrible.  All right, John.  Thanks.  Bye.  We have to take a break.  Okay, okay.  Kurt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Don't you mean all these stories are allegedly?  No, that really happened.  I clocked that bitch right in the face.  Only the rape stuff is allegedly.  Allegedly.  I.  Later, guys.  F-Q-P-T-H.  It starts with an A.  Nine, three.  It starts with an A. 
[02:09:00]  Allegedly.  Uh-huh.  Pie, R squared.  How do I spell that?  Three, nine, two, A.  Allegedly.  No?  No.  We have to take a break, Tyson.  How about I break you?  We have to take a break.  So, a great Mike Tyson impression, and I have Mike's reddish blonde hair.  No, no, no, no.  My name is Opie.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, you guys, let's hear it for Anthony and the great job of Dave.  Shut up.  It was Opie.  Opie, Opie, Opie. 
[02:09:30]  Impersonating Mike Tyson.  Anthony, everyone.  I'm going to come into the room.  Anthony.  I'm going to go on the show and punch Opie in the testicles.  No, no, no, no, no.  And watch him look like my tiger looks.  You know, Anthony, out of all the voices you do, I think your Mike Tyson is the best.  I just like the way the tiger looks at me when I punch him in the testicles.  They never get that in the wild.  And you know, they are not from Africa.  They are from Asia and India.  That is their natural habitat.  Habitat.  M-O. 
[02:10:00]  No.  The symbol for uranium.  No, it's A.  C.  There's a C in there, right?  Best punch of my life.  Good job, Anthony.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm going to punch you.  No, no.  No, no.  That's Anthony.  Ow.  Hi, Mike Tyson in this.  Yeah.  It wouldn't even be three.  It would be one.  Dead. 
[02:10:30]  Dead.  All right.  We should take a break.  Okay.  One more shot.  Oh, that's good.  More from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Give us a call.  Toll free.  877-692-1027.  Are we doing the code for men thing next?  We can do that, right?  The unwritten laws.  Yeah.  Men must abide by.  Okay.  As we go to break, they're begging us in Philadelphia at WYSP to give away some tickets to Babe Fest, 
[02:11:00]  which is happening this Thursday at Electric Factory.  It's a huge ticket in Philadelphia.  It's hosted by Kid Rock and Slash's Snake Pit will be performing.  We're going to give away like 10 pairs of tickets right now to some random callers.  877-692-1027.  Yes, Anthony.  Oh, yes, Mike.  I have the Babe Fest in my room.  You should see them all.  They end up looking like paintings because they're just up on the wall with these dopey looks on their face.  It's like, why the hell would you punch me so hard that my uterus fell out? 
[02:11:30]  But I do.  It's fun.  Uterus, cue.  That was you.  Okay.  I'm starting to feel the Zoloft.  I'm getting woozy.  Anthony and his Mike Tyson impression.  They're splattered against the wall with their arms and legs in certain ways that it looks like hieroglyphics.  Hieroglyphics.  Oh, my God.  I ain't even going to start that one.  Let's see.  Firestone Tire and the Broom. 
[02:12:00]  How do you spell that?  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony Planet Java.  Almost got you again.  Yeah, we love the Planet Java.  We finally got our latest shipment of the stuff.  Yeah.  Javadelic, which is the low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  They got the Karamoca.  And my favorite for special occasions, Tremble.  Tremble.  When you want to just go around shaking.  121 milligrams of caffeine in the Tremble. 
[02:12:30]  Planet Java.  They got sampling trucks all over the place now, crisscrossing the area for a month.  And this Thursday, June 21st, they're making their first big-time appearance in New Jersey at the Keensburg Water Amusement Park.  From 1 to 5 p.m.  So check them out.  Great-tasting Planet Java's out to kick the competition's ass.  Like Opie said, they got all kinds of great flavors.  Javadelic, Karamoca.  And, of course, Tremble.  The wildest thing in town.  Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  It's available wherever you find Coca-Cola products.  And if your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, demand they get the Planet Java. 
[02:13:00]  You're going to love it.  Like I said, if you need a boost of energy, Tremble's the way to go.  Iced coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  It's Planet Java.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  I just can't get over how good Anthony's Mike Tyson impression was today. 
[02:13:30]  Hey.  And you were on fire today.  Don't get me in trouble.  Unbelievable.  I don't want to get punched in the testicle.  There are days I bow to you with your impression.  Great.  If Rick ever comes up to me and goes, hey, guess who's coming in today?  And it's Mike Tyson.  I'm taking a sick day.  You think you shake on the Tremble.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even be able to imagine him walking through that door and sitting down.  That would be the ultimate surprise for this radio show. 
[02:14:00]  Punching me in the testicles.  And Jim Norton in the studio.  Yeah.  Killing us today.  Moms, don't forget, we're doing the Moms I'd Like to F contest starting next week, next Monday.  It's like all the other contests we have done here on our radio program.  The moms will come down anytime next week between the hours of 3 and 7.  And you show up what you got with lingerie and things like that.  You should, like, bring a picture of your kids so we don't have any ringers in this contest. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  And then we'll put all the moms up on the Internet and the listeners will vote for their favorite mom they'd love to ask.  And we've got some great prizes that we'll announce tomorrow.  Okay?  Wonderful.  Let me go to Josh real fast.  Josh, what's up?  Yo, I just wanted to say, hey, Opie, that's one of the best impressions I've ever heard.  No, no, no, no.  No, that's pretty good.  Everyone knows I don't do impressions.  That's why it's part of the drinking game when I do.  Uh-huh.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:15:00]  Uh-huh.  No.  Why don't we fess up to who it really was?  All right.  Yeah.  Opie.  Water doodle.  I'm doing a Mike Tyson impression there on the Greaseman show.  Water doodle, bone dry, big guy.  Kick my ass.  Punch me in the testicles.  Water doodle.  Ow.  All right.  Hey, what's the latest on the wheelchair, man?  This is just a great story in New York.  I love the stories where everyone's brought together by tragedy, and they come with an 
[02:15:30]  outpouring of gifts and money, and then it turns out the guy that was in need of help  was just full of crap, and that seems to be what's happening with this wheelchair guy.  Disabled vet, James Daly, says that, what was that, about two weeks ago or a week ago  or whatever, last week, he was rolling down the sidewalk on his little motorized wheelchair.  Vietnam vet, right?  You've seen him, the little rascals.  Mm-hmm.  I'm a little rascal on my little rascal. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, you want to play that bit?  You see the commercials for those things?  I can go to the park and play with my grandson now.  Like, gee, yeah.  Go long, Grandpa.  Ah, one mile an hour.  All right, when he gets there, cut left, and I'll throw you the pass, Gramps.  And they said that he was robbed of his wheelchair.  Yeah.  He said some guy came up.  Just dumped him on his ass.  Dumped him.  And took the motorized wheelchair.  And took the 300-pound wheelchair. 
[02:16:30]  Obviously, you're not carrying this thing away, right?  So, what, did he get away riding it at one and a half a mile an hour?  It sounded like the guy was going to, you know, stand up and chase him at that point.  Right.  It doesn't matter how slow the wheelchair was.  But, I mean, you could say, hey, there he goes.  Get him.  Uh-oh.  Well, what are we going to do?  And we're in high-speed pursuit of a wheelchair.  He might get up into the twos of miles per hour. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, how you doing?  No.  Oh, sorry.  No, no.  So, it was a little fishy.  I think the cops didn't like his story.  Well, it hit the press, and we all felt bad for the guy, and we got him a new wheelchair.  Somebody donated a brand-new wheelchair to the guy.  You say you parked it out back last night, and when you got up, it was gone.  The insurance company buys you a new wheelchair.  Animal House.  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  So, they said that what happened...  You don't remember that with the car?  No, you just...  You got me, finally.  The car.  When they're getting flounder, get drunk, because they wrecked the Continental, his brother's car.  Oh, okay, okay.  You say you parked it out back last night, and when you woke up, it was gone.  Okay.  The insurance company buys your brother a new car.  And Bluto's sitting there making all the faces.  Cool.  It's really good.  Great movie.  Stumped me.  So, what happens is the guy's telling the story to the cops, and all of a sudden, the cops are like, 
[02:18:00]  a few loose ends here.  So, they check surveillance cameras.  Here's the thing.  You can't do anything, anywhere, anymore, and not be on camera.  Especially in a big city like New York.  Every corner, every building, they got their security cameras.  And it's not just, you know, cameras that you can see.  There's plenty you can't see.  People have web cameras out the window, for God's sake.  You're on camera more than off when you're in this city.  So, they asked around.  They got some surveillance tapes.  They see a car pull up. 
[02:18:30]  This buddy of this guy, this vet, takes him out of the back seat, and he lays down on the sidewalk.  But he drives away.  He's yelling, help me!  Help!  I'm on the sidewalk!  And then he comes up with a story.  Turns out, he gave his friend the wheelchair, so he could get a new wheelchair.  So, now he's trying to say, no, that isn't what happened.  But my mother told me not to talk to the press.  But when I do, you'll hear the story of what really happened.  It's going to clear the whole thing up for everyone. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Which just sounds like, I don't have a good story yet.  But when I think of one, you're going to hear it.  Let's go to Humphrey.  Humphrey, what's going on?  You.  Hey, what's up?  I knew this guy almost my whole life.  I lived in that neighborhood.  You know him, okay.  He's the biggest junkie thief scumbag that you ever saw in your life.  Really?  As soon as I read it in the paper, it was a scam.  Really?  Yeah, this guy was never any good.  And I don't think he even went to Vietnam.  Nah, he must have went to Vietnam.  I'm not sure.  He's got all the tattoos.  He's got the tattoos.  I see a tattoo. 
[02:19:30]  That's got to mean a vet.  Is that a Jessica Rabbit tattoo on his calf, Anthony?  Hey, it looks like one.  Some big busted chick on his shin.  On his non-working shin.  Oh, Norton.  He's dangling limply with a pretty girl on his.  He said he was very injured in a car wreck many years ago.  And I was driving down the street.  And some hoodlums took my wheelchair and left me on the ground.  And they stole my shoes and my glasses. 
[02:20:00]  And they punched me in the testicles like a lion or a tiger, whatever the hell it was.  Very injured.  Mike punched me in the face.  So, yeah, now they're saying he was arrested.  And he had to pay $1,000 bail.  And he's back in court on Thursday.  But there you go.  That's what you get for being a good guy.  And he said soon he'll face the media, like you said earlier, and give his version of the story.  In time.  I was driving down the sidewalk and these young hoods pushed me over. 
[02:20:30]  I was very injured.  I fell.  And my head was bashed apart.  Same thing happened in Vietnam.  I was in a foxhole shooting gooks and a hand grenade flew in.  And I covered it with my body being blown into many pieces that were later sewed together.  I jumped my motorcycle over the garbage barrels at Arnold's. 
[02:21:00]  And at the end, I hit the chicken stand.  And I was very injured.  Hey, Cunningham in my office.  Ow.  And I was injured then, too.  And I jumped the Snake River Canyon on the Sky Cycle.  And I fell in the canyon, thus injuring me then badly.  It hurt me.  I was dancing at an Israeli wedding and the floor fell down. 
[02:21:30]  As I was doing the Macarena.  And my wheelchair fell through the floor to Havan Aguila.  And I was injured then, too.  It hurt me.  I was piloting the Challenger.  And it blew up.  I plummeted into the ocean.  And then after, I jumped a horse after my Superman movie.  And now I'm paralyzed.  In the wheelchair.  Very injured.  And it's hurting me. 
[02:22:00]  Very injured.  Timmy.  Timma.  I was in a band.  The Lords of the Underworld.  Timma.  Ah.  Josh, what's up?  Hi, I'm just wondering.  Did you hear about the other guy in New York that they caught lying?  No.  He said he originated everything in New York radio.  I did.  And today he had an interview with Buddy Epson.  I did invent everything. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, FHS.  What's happening now?  I hear Norton's not showing up tomorrow for our show.  He wants more money.  Inside joke.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Very injured.  You know what?  We have to play.  I was driving car number three.  And I was racing and hit a wall.  Oh.  Ouch.  I would have won that race.  I'm the intimidator.  Shut up.  My glasses flew off my head along with my eyeballs. 
[02:23:00]  And it very injured me greatly.  And I'm hurting now.  Oh.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  I was driving a truck through L.A. in the riots.  And people bashed my skull in with a brick.  That was after the cops pulled me over and hit me with billy clubs.  Ha-ha-ha.  Oh.  I'm hurting now.  Waddle doodle.  I'm the grease man.  Ha-ha-ha.  I did the Tyson impression.  Hey, I'll punch you, bitch.  Oh.  Ha-ha-ha. 
[02:23:30]  How many more dopey crossover bits can I do?  We have to play Rick's favorite bit.  Yeah.  Easily.  You love this bit, don't you?  This thing makes me cry every time I hear it.  Just ask Stinky.  Stinky looks at me like I'm retarded sometimes.  It's good old Bill.  They call my name's Bill.  Hey.  And he called up to buy a wheelchair.  An electric wheelchair.  All right.  So he could get around.  Hello?  Hello, sir.  I'm an elderly gentleman and I need a motorized scooter. 
[02:24:00]  They call my name's Bill.  What's your name, sir?  They call my name's Bill.  Bill?  Yes.  Have you seen a particular type that you like?  I like the little rascal.  The rascal?  I saw that on the TV.  I'm a little rascal in my little rascal.  Uh-huh.  Is what the woman said.  That's what the woman said, huh?  And she's getting around.  She's shopping and eating ice cream.  How fast does it go, sir? 
[02:24:30]  The fastest is about five miles an hour.  I flew a P-51 Mustang in the big one.  Yeah.  It won't go that fast.  Oh, it won't?  No.  I need also a room in the back for an oxygen tank because I'm on oxygen.  Oh, I see.  And it's got to have good suspension because I don't want my colostomy bag dislodging.  No, you don't want that either.  No.  The bigger machines will have like a spring suspension in the front.  Oh, boy.  My friend Petey's got one and it's a real chick magnet. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah?  He goes around at the bingo game and he gives the girls rides on the back.  Can I get a two-seater?  No, you can't get a two-seater.  But I can't be jostled around too much.  I've got a prostate like a porcupine.  Yeah, I see.  Yeah, that's kind of tough.  You can stop by our showroom.  We have three or four models on the floor and we get them in.  Excuse me, sir.  How the hell am I supposed to get there?  You're not driving anymore?  No.  I drove in a lake and they took my car away. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, I see.  Can I take one of these like on major highways?  No, you cannot.  Because my grandson lives far away and I like to play some ball with him.  No, you can't do that, no.  I can't?  No.  The furthest they'll go is about 24, 25 miles.  Is that the furthest range?  Yeah, and they go about five miles an hour.  So you'd be kind of lost on the highway, don't you think?  I don't have much.  I have nothing else to do.  What else am I going to do with my time?  If it takes me two hours to get ten miles, I don't care.  Also, I lost my arm in the big one. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, you did?  Do you have any kind of catapults so I could play ball with my grandson?  Like a pitching arm or something?  No, no.  They call my name Bill.  Could you just come over and shoot me in the head?  No.  I mean, hell, I was big once.  I was in the war.  I was a commander.  And now I got to drive on a three-wheel battery-powered scooter?  Yeah, that's sad.  This is degrading.  It is degrading.  Sam, could you just shoot me?  Could you take a goddamn gun and shoot me in the freaking head? 
[02:26:30]  No, I don't think so.  Please, I'll come down, put my head under a wheel of one of the scooters and hit go.  I don't think it would do anything.  Could you do that to me, Tony?  No, I don't think so.  They just hit me in the brainstem with a ball-peen hammer, Sam.  Could you do that?  No, no, I don't think so.  I mean, hell, I haven't been laid since the Kaiser was in Germany, for Christ's sake.  I have big bologna breasts.  I haven't seen a naked woman in 42 years. 
[02:27:00]  That's a long time.  Do you know what that's like?  My pants are up to my nipples and I'm calling for a scooter.  Yeah, what's your last name, Bill?  I have wraparound eyeglasses.  I look like the freaking Terminator, Sam.  I've lived for 85 years.  It's enough already, for Christ's sake.  Kill me.  Could someone just kill me?  My name's Bill.  They call my name's Bill.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:27:30]  My teeth just fell off.  My freaking teeth.  I spit my teeth out of my head.  Kill me.  Somebody just kill me, for Christ's sake.  That's sad.  What a sad story.  I love that bit.  That's great.  Hey, before we play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?

Yeah.  It was a great bit.
