<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, frequently employing crude language and offensive humor.  The show began with a discussion about the firing of Sacramento radio hosts Rob, Arnie, and Dawn for jokes about transgender teens, including one host’s statement that he would hit his son for wearing heels. Opie and Anthony debated the appropriateness of the comments, the role of GLAAD in the firing, and the limits of free speech in radio, referencing Thomas Beattie and Buck Angel.  A caller, John from Jersey, and regular caller Brooklyn Ace weighed in, largely agreeing with the hosts’ criticisms of perceived oversensitivity.  The hosts also critiqued the fired hosts’ apology.

The broadcast then moved to a discussion of the cockpit audio from Captain Sully Sullenberger's Hudson River landing, followed by a news story about a tased 72-year-old great-grandmother.  Adam Lambert's coming out and the relative anonymity of the actual American Idol winner that year were discussed, leading to a chaotic discussion about that year's American Idol contestants.  A significant portion focused on Jimmy Norton's struggles with a calorie-counting app, interspersed with listener calls offering weight loss advice and jokes.  A John Montone news report about a "Big Gay Ice Cream" truck provided further fodder for off-color jokes, and there was a brief mention of a Slim Jim plant explosion.

The hosts then delved into a comparison of steel-cut and instant oatmeal, using a crude analogy.  The discussion continued on calorie counting, with listener calls and exaggerated comedic pronouncements. A caller, Dan from Utah, advocated for lifestyle changes over strict dieting. Another caller, Dave, shared his fitness routine, prompting Jimmy to declare his desire to become a "twink."  The conversation shifted to studio guest Kate Cooper, a musician.  Opie and Anthony focused intensely on photographing Kate, making numerous suggestive comments about her breasts. Kate promoted her website, Katecoopermusic.com, and performed "Try Again," which was interrupted by technical difficulties.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit banter with Kate, detailing her role-playing with her boyfriend, Roland, her extensive hair removal, and her online presence.  Adam Ferrara called in to promote his Comedy Central special, "Funny as Hell," leading to discussions about breakups, family, and his role in "Rescue Me." Patrice O'Neal briefly appeared.

A phone interview with Adam Ferrara followed, promoting his Comedy Central special and DVD.  He also discussed his stand-up career and the brief appearances of Little Nicky and other celebrities (Dave Matthews, Nicole Kidman) near the studio.  The conversation was filled with vulgar language and jokes.  This was followed by a discussion of a dashcam video of an elderly woman being tased by police, with callers, including a police officer, debating the incident.  David Carradine's death and graphic details from online photos were also discussed. The segment concluded with sexually charged conversations about the relationship between Roland and Kate Cooper.

A further segment featured Kate Cooper again, where a deal was negotiated for her to show her buttocks in exchange for performing a song. She revealed a tattoo and discussed her sex life, including her age of first sexual experience and preferences. Roland detailed his experiences in Sweden, including excessive drinking, jumping naked from a cruise ship, and observations about Swedish culture.  The hosts then discussed a viral video of a McDonald's employee being forced to strip, speculating about the unedited version. The segment ended with further discussion of the video and the hosts preparing for a business meeting.  Throughout, the conversation was highly sexualized and laced with vulgar language and offensive jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi there.  Hi there.  They got rid of another radio show?  What?  Rob, Arnie, and Dawn?  Who?  What happened to them?  The first instant feedback.  A morning talk station in Sacramento, California, was canceled due to angry fags, this guy writes. 
[00:00:30]  What?  The Rob, Arnie, and Dawn show.  Did we tease them one time? That's very familiar.  I think it might be one of Bob's clients.  Rob, Arnie, Rob, Arnie, and Dawn.  What'd they do?  They probably didn't...  Nothing.  Nothing.  Just so goddamn sensitive.  In regular radio.  Wouldn't it be funny, though, if they were bringing gay guys in and just beating them and expecting to not get fired? 
[00:01:00]  They were like, well, they can turn the dial if they don't like it.  People are using the argument wrong.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, we just hit people.  It's freedom of speech.  We lost another show on regular radio, Dan.  What's that about?  Well, it says here that on May 28th, the radio hosts joked about transgender teens and called them freaks.  And they got fired for that?  Wow, that must be one of those real...  Jimmy, what's a transgender teen?  Well, it's a...  A tranny still has a dick, right? 
[00:01:30]  A tranny is a girl who nature has smiled upon in other ways.  Transgender just means you're wearing female clothes if you're a guy or whatever.  It can be...  I think it can be girl to guy, too, but most commonly, I'm going to guess, it's going to be like a transsexual teenager.  A guy who's a girl as a teenager.  What's wrong with calling them freaks?  Absolutely nothing.  T.T. Barnum would have had them in a sideshow. 
[00:02:00]  I think the literal definition of a freak might fit that criteria.  It's freaky.  It's different.  It's not the norm.  It's not what we're used to.  Yeah.  Why can't people just talk honestly?  And why is it that it's okay at the Gay Pride Parade or all these other places for people to go,  we're just going to let our freak flag fly?  See, people only want certain language used if they're empowering themselves with it.  It's fucking enraging.  One of the biggest ones is queer.  Yeah.  Like, you can't use the word queer like that, but, you know, gay people throw it around with each other. 
[00:02:30]  They call themselves queer.  They're queer.  A little weird.  A little off.  A little queer.  A little, you know...  It's kind of odd.  So they got fired for calling them freaks?  That's it?  That couldn't be it.  Come on.  That couldn't be it.  There's also a quote that says, host Arnie States...  Host Arnie States said he was joking when he said, if my son, God forbid, if my son put  on a pair of high heels, I would probably hit him with one of my shoes.  All right.  Why can't you say that?  What's wrong with that?  Isn't that one of the fears of being a parent?  Yes. 
[00:03:00]  It absolutely is.  Why can't you just talk openly about what that does to you?  Most parents, you know...  Why can't you do that on the radio?  Children who grow up straight, as they say.  I would gather.  Transgender.  We have to accept all that?  Why?  What can't...  It's gender.  Especially you can't make fun of it?  I'm not going to run around and start slapping them, but, you know, I want to be able to  at least talk about it, that it makes me a little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  We'll part company there.  But, I mean, you can't...  To not be able to make fun of something like that, it's like fucking regular radio just stinks. 
[00:03:30]  I guess we made fun of Rob, Arnie, and Dawn, but you know what?  Today we don't.  Today we go, what the fuck?  Yeah, they should not be fired.  Another casualty.  It's just ridiculous.  Ah, we lost Brooklyn Ace.  I was just about to go to you, Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn ass now.  Uh-huh.  It doesn't look like they've been fired.  I think they just were suspended until Thursday.  Oh, until they find out, do an investigation. 
[00:04:00]  Just suspended?  So, so fired.  Maybe they'll make it.  Greg, what's going on?  What's going on, boy?  Greg!  Basically, what happened here is they didn't even...  A couple of guys made a comment that if their kids were transsexuals, one of them had said  that he would hit them with a shield, hit them with a high heel, and the other one made  the comment that he would call them an idiot.  So, uh, the Gay and Lesbians Alliance, uh, attacked their, uh, sponsors, basically, advertisement.  So these guys pulled themselves off me. 
[00:04:30]  And the one guy, uh, I wish I could remember his name, uh, refused to apologize, so.  I remember that.  Oh, I remember these guys.  The one guy wears, like, a suit because he's, like, the conservative dude.  And the other guy's like Tank.  Keeping it all safe.  The other guy's, like, the sports guy with the sports jersey on.  He's Tank, right?  Big arms and tats.  And then you got the whole...  And the whole, yes.  You know what?  It's amazing.  The gay, uh, GLAAD, the gay and lesbian, whatever, whatever, what is it called?  Gay and lesbian, don't fuck with them. 
[00:05:00]  It's GLAAD.  They're the gay, they don't play games.  But they've, uh, they've given Red Eye a lot of shit on Fox.  I'm not just saying that's why I'm doing it tonight.  It's not important.  But Greg Gutfeld is a guy, he said, he said, we've invited them to come on so many times  and have a debate or whatever, and he'd be fair with them, and they won't go on.  It's amazing how many of these organizations only want to go a place where they're going  to be handled with kid gloves instead of going on this, uh, aggressive, what they would  see as an aggressive atmosphere and dealing with a guy who wouldn't even be shitty to  them. 
[00:05:30]  It's really irritating.  They want to just blast you in the media and send out a press release where it's safe  and it's structured, and they don't have to defend a point, and they don't have to  be made to look ridiculous for overreacting.  If they have to sit and defend a point, uh, they could lose.  So why do that?  Why not just put out a press release and, uh, call for someone's firing and, and, uh,  leave it at that.  No debate, nothing.  Shouldn't it be okay to call them freaks, though?  It should be, yeah.  It should be, it should be, it's not something you're, if it's not something you're comfortable  with in your world, why can't you openly discuss that? 
[00:06:00]  And then, of course, make a few jokes because you're trying to entertain people.  Their argument is, why aren't we allowed to entertain people with edgy stuff on regular  radio?  I, I, I just will never understand that.  But you watch, like, a, a movie or a TV show, they're allowed to.  Reality shows are allowed to, radios, you know, it's an extension of all that.  It's, it's a totally different animal radio.  For some reason, it, it falls into this category where you can't be comedic on it without it 
[00:06:30]  being taken completely seriously in, in, in the wrong context.  Just, you can't just be funny and goof around.  They say, well, and this is what's so sickening about these arguments about human, they're  like, well, it fosters a climate.  And that's the excuse that every group uses.  And it's like Matthew Shepard being beaten to death is not fostered by somebody making  a joke.  It's like, it's all out of whack.  It's like, if you can't tell the difference between these guys making some stupid joke  and somebody saying, look, you know, gays are dangerous and they should be attacked. 
[00:07:00]  If you can't see the difference between those things, then you just, you're, you just become  a parody of yourself.  It's fostered by, uh, lunatics who, um, uh, have problems with their own sexuality.  Yeah.  And then they go out and, uh, commit violent acts against gay people.  Not, not, uh, the occasional, um, gay joke or comment about somebody being gay.  It's a, that doesn't foster, but people don't all of a sudden go, yeah, you know something?  I'm going to go out and commit some violence now. 
[00:07:30]  It's these twisted people that, you know, start thinking when they're laying in bed at  night, looking at the ceiling, I think I like the cock and it upsets them so much.  They have to do something.  They have to, yes, strike out at people that, you know, might like the cock.  Fucking twisted.  There's a difference between calling for somebody to do something violent or, or really trying  to, to, to get people into a bad situation and making fun of something.  Yeah.  And everybody knows the difference. 
[00:08:00]  So they just, people don't like you making fun of certain things because it bothers,  it defends their sense of what's right and wrong.  And that's all it is.  But they can't come out and just say that.  Right.  They can't come out and go, you know what?  I don't like it.  You shouldn't say it.  Yeah.  So they have to tie it in with a bigger issue.  Well, it fosters.  I guarantee you that's what they say.  And the group, the group looks weak too.  You know, when, when you have to like take a radio show off the air because they made  fun of transgender.  Yeah.  Like, can't transgender people like defend themselves?  Can't gay people defend themselves?  Can't black people defend themselves? 
[00:08:30]  Asians just go down the line.  Why, why are they being protect?  They can protect themselves.  I'd be embarrassed if I was in one of those groups.  And again, when you look at the game.  Someone is telling me, you know, oh, we got to take the show off the air so you're safer  as a human being.  That's ridiculous.  When you look at the outrageousness of the gay pride parade, which is fine.  It's kind of, it's an event and it's fun to watch and you get all, but whatever.  But it's like, it's okay to, to go to that extreme and to, like they say, let your freak  flag fly.  But if somebody else says you're a freak in a, not a good way, that's bad. 
[00:09:00]  It's like, well, how can you express yourself completely without hurting other people and  not want somebody else to express themselves?  Even if it's not, you understand what I'm saying?  I'm not making my point well, but I think you'd.  So if we hit the streets today and we see a teenager, you know, a transgender teenager,  what are we supposed to do if we were a robot?  Have just a normal conversation with them, not notice that, wow, that's freaky.  Yeah.  You're supposed to.  It's the first word that comes to your mind.  Have tolerance.  Because it's the same thing you think of when you see somebody who has green hair, who does 
[00:09:30]  their hair green or who has too many piercings or too many tattoos.  You're like, that guy's a freak.  It's like, it's what we always say.  And it doesn't mean that you want somebody attacked or you want somebody treated differently.  Yeah.  There's, there's, yeah, that's a big leap from going, wow, that's a little freaky to picking  up the heaviest object in the area and built it in the head.  Exactly.  Let's go to Brooklyn Ace.  He called back.  Uh, BA, what's up?  Opie, you used my line.  Why am I going to stay on the hold and wait for you to go to me?  I didn't know.  What line did you have?  I was talking about the fact that you went to war with Rob Barney and Dawn. 
[00:10:00]  I remember that with the suit and the whole nine yards.  It was hysterical.  Oh, okay.  But I thought you had more on this, uh, this story that broke today.  Moron?  No.  No.  No?  Later.  All right.  Sorry, buddy.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Not really.  Nah.  And he hung on to tell you that.  No, well, because we told him to call back, so, you know, he's disciplined.  All right, I'll call back.  God, regular radio is just shit.  Will the new administration loosen up restraints on radio? 
[00:10:30]  No.  They got other things to worry about, so that might help a little.  They're worse with the political correctness than anybody.  Kind of agree with you.  They don't want that administration.  You think the Obama administration wants people making jokes about ethnic backgrounds, sexuality,  things like that?  Fuck no.  Plus, it's about diversity.  And this is hate.  This is hate radio.  I love that one.  Hate radio shop.  You want fucking hate radio?  I'd love to give you a real example of hate radio and then compare it to what you call 
[00:11:00]  hate radio.  You know what?  You'd see the difference between jokes and real hatred.  Plus, it's a revenue stream, so why would the government say no to revenue, which is  what these bigger fines are?  They're not going to say, give us less money on a fine.  Let me say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that I'm gay, and that group, GLAAD, just sets everybody back and 
[00:11:30]  makes life a total pain in the ass for anybody that's gay.  And there's no reason those guys should have been fired.  I mean, you should be able to take a fucking joke and just lay him up.  Everybody should be able to.  Or even criticism.  It's like GLAAD comes in and defends certain things.  It's like, yeah, there are cases where gays are just targeted and bashed and treated violently,  and it's like you do need a group to stand up for that because it's like, you know, it's  got to suck.  You're walking down the street and some fucking animals jump out of the car and just attack 
[00:12:00]  you.  But where's the balance between really defending and protecting yourselves and protecting people  and just being a little oversensitive to humor?  But like any other group, though, any other type of minority group that, you know, activist  group, they're stuck on issues that are outdated.  They're stuck on things that are just not relevant anymore.  It's like the ACLU or something like that, and they're just fighting about things and  arguing about things that just aren't even relevant anymore, and that doesn't even happen 
[00:12:30]  except, I mean, it just hasn't in the last 20 years.  And GLAAD is no different than that, and they just need to lighten up, and they're just  doing us more of a disservice than anything else.  But you're right.  It's all special interest groups.  It's like whenever a group says, this is what we do and we're aligned with this segment  of the population, then they have to, I guess, keep themselves busy or keep themselves fighting  things, or else they're just going to sit there and stagnate with nothing to do as an  organization cease to exist. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Even worse than GLAAD, though, John, is the advertisers buckling, you know?  All of a sudden GLAAD calls up all the advertisers, and the advertisers are like, all right, I'll yank  all my stuff immediately.  Instead of the advertisers going, you know what?  We understand your concern, but we don't think Rob, Arnie, and Dawn were really trying  to get at anything here.  Well, they're afraid to be associated with anything that's different.  Yeah, except for a normal reaction from a human being.  Yeah, it can't be right.  They weren't encouraging hate or violence or any of that. 
[00:13:30]  It was just a natural reaction to probably a story they had that morning.  Can't the advertisers listen to something and then make a determination on their own and  go, you know what?  They just can't for some reason.  It's a blanket thing.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I know.  They freak out.  Over the dumbest, stupidest, littlest things.  But where's the...  I'm sorry, but where's the...  I keep saying balance, but it's like gay people, look, in fairness, are sick and tired 
[00:14:00]  of just having, like, wanting to get married and not being able to, and they're just probably  fucking fed up with all this stuff.  But then where's the balance between that and then wanting Miss America or Miss California  vilified just for giving her opinion, which doesn't agree with theirs?  She shouldn't have been vilified.  She's entitled to an opinion.  Right.  Oh, thank God you're saying that, John.  Jesus.  Because that fucking thing was blown out of proportion, too.  Of course it was.  You know, I'm more upset about the last Miss America girl.  Just popping in.  Just popping in.  Just popping in.  Just popping in.  Just popping in.  Just popping in.  Just popping in. 
[00:14:30]  Just popping in.  Just popping in.  What's that?  The last...  That one other Miss America...  I think it was Miss North Carolina.  She couldn't even complete a sentence.  She was asked about reading and totally fucked it up.  Oh, yeah.  She shouldn't...  It was the big YouTube video.  That's more upsetting to me than the one girl not liking gay marriage.  Yeah, shouldn't all the readers get together and get really pissed off that she can't even  answer a question about reading?  All literate people should attack her.  Exactly.  Let's get a special interest group together.  All right, John. 
[00:15:00]  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Don't be confused.  We think Rob, Arnie, and Dawn should be fired for being hacks, but...  Poor bastards.  It leads into, I guess, the next story as we throw the ball around a little bit.  That man thing had its second kid.  Oh, Thomas Beattie really bugs me.  I know.  You had a whole chapter in your book, Jimmy, on this guy.  Only because it's not a guy.  This guy.  I'm saying it.  Thomas Beattie.  Where's the...  I just had the...  Oh, here it is.  You take the boobs out.  You cut off the cock and you give it a few... 
[00:15:30]  Cut off the cock?  No, but this is...  No, there was no cock.  There was no...  That's what defuses everybody.  It's a woman.  Yeah.  And the fact that the media, again, and not that I point this out brilliantly in my book,  who cares?  It's not about me and selling copies for myself and getting a third one.  Not important.  Can we back the truck up slightly?  Rob from Rob, Arnie, and Dawn.  So, I guess they took themselves off the air?  No.  They're saying that?  No.  What do you know, E-Rod?  From what it seems, the company that they were employed by made them put up an apology 
[00:16:00]  on their website before...  Oh, no.  This is horrible.  Before destroying their entire website.  Yeah.  That's why we had to stop, Jimmy.  I glanced at this thing.  Oh, no.  And this is like...  This is...  We've said no to this exact letter many times in our career.  Dude, this is probably the worst apology ever.  Yeah.  You want to read it, Ant?  Oh, I'd love to.  Okay.  Do we have some sappy music?  Some type of sappy... 
[00:16:30]  Sappy, like...  Apology music.  Some type of piano.  Like the bed to a cancer commercial.  How about a sorry song?  No, no vocals.  Any good sorry songs?  No vocals.  How about the Hulk walking away music?  Yeah, that works.  Really?  That's sad and sappy.  Something just sappy, though.  Let's see what Travis comes up with.  Yeah, let's see what Travis can do in a pinch.  With sappy.  He's freaking out now.  Watch him play Ass Cunt.  Live version.  Oh, this is good.  All right. 
[00:17:00]  This is listy.  How sad do you want to make this, Travis?  No kidding.  To our loyal Rob, Arnie, and Dawn followers, we have failed you.  As a show, as people, as broadcasters, we have simply failed you.  We have failed on almost every level.  Can I stop you?  Yeah, of course.  Right there, they should be fired.  Yes.  Right there.  For real.  I don't even care what they did anymore.  I'm going to join GLAAD and fight harder for them to be removed.  This is so bad. 
[00:17:30]  That's just embarrassing.  That's the first paragraph.  We presented our opinions on a very sensitive subject in a hateful, childish, and crude fashion.  And then, given the opportunity to retract those remarks, we defended them.  Which was the proper thing to do.  Yeah.  You had a human moment.  Of course.  Since then, you, our loyal listeners, have made it clear to us that we went too far. 
[00:18:00]  The response has been overwhelming.  None of you said that we couldn't have opinions.  Yet so many of you said that the way we gave them crossed the line.  Further, you said that our attempt to mask our comments as jokes that would be understood by our audience was unacceptable.  I would say now that it was worse than that. 
[00:18:30]  It was cowardly.  You have made that clear.  We have reached out to various groups and asked for a chance to make this right.  To respond with their participation to the education that our audience has provided us.  That opportunity has been graciously granted this Thursday morning, June 11th, at 7.30 a.m.  The word apology appears nowhere in this letter for a reason. 
[00:19:00]  It appears right there, right there.  Yeah, I just saw the apology.  No, right there.  It says the word apology.  It says the word apology appears nowhere in this letter for a reason.  It's a tactic that Kirk uses a lot of times when he tries to drive robots crazy.  He puts them in that little spin thing.  I didn't say the word apology, but you just said it by not saying it, but you did.  Bap, bap, bap.  And Kirk goes away.  What they should have said in this statement is the word apology appears nowhere in this letter other than right here  and then had an arrow pointing back to the apology.  That would have been accurate.  That sentence doesn't make sense. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  I found a sentence that doesn't make sense.  The word apology appears nowhere in this letter for a reason.  But it's right there.  The word apology appears nowhere in this letter for a reason.  Can we enjoy that sentence for a while?  That really is something.  The word apology appears nowhere in this letter.  It's like the first time you read objects in mirror are closer than they appear.  Sure.  It took a little while to figure it out.  Right.  Does it look closer or are they really closer?  Yeah, the actual word is definitely in this letter. 
[00:20:00]  It's there.  Maybe the context of the word is different.  But it's there.  But it's there.  The word apology appears nowhere in this letter for a reason.  We already hid from doing the right thing once and we're not going to make that mistake again.  Apologizing in a written posted statement is a form of cowardice.  We will say what needs to be said this Thursday.  To interject a little asterisk here. 
[00:20:30]  I would say what is cowardice is groveling in all caps.  Yes, groveling in caps and then teasing your apology that's going to be live on your show Thursday at 730.  It's a tease.  I think they're really, you would think they're just trying to save their jobs and think they realize, oh boy, we're done if we don't do this right.  On a final personal note.  Oh, no.  As the leader and owner of the show.  I have made the decision that we need to refrain from broadcasting new episodes until we can address this on Thursday. 
[00:21:00]  We will rejoin, return to the air at 730 a.m. June 11th.  Rob Williams, Rob, Arnie, and Dawn.  Looks like someone had vacation time.  And they said June 11th, 730.  June 11th, 730.  They said it twice.  Well, 730 is the most listened to hour.  Yeah.  Or part of the 7 o'clock hour.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  For a morning show.  That's one of the most people listening.  You're right.  The groveling that is going on.  Well, I got more on what they said.  Controversy surrounding remarks about transgender children.  Rob and Arnie engaged in a 30-minute conversation in which they described transgender people as freaks and idiots.  Arnie said, and he's what, the tank character?  Sometimes it feels as good as a girl.  They're like, what?  I didn't mean that.  See the magic? 
[00:22:00]  Beat the Lakers last night.  He said, you know, my favorite part about hearing these stories about the kids in high school, who the entire high school caters around, lets the boy wear the dress.  I look forward to when they go out into society and society beats them down.  And they end up in therapy.  Could be used figuratively.  Yeah.  He's fine.  I'm not talking about it.  He's fine.  Society beats them down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure it was taken.  And they end up in therapy.  Arnie also said, if my son, God forbid, if my son put on a pair of high heels, I would probably hit him with one of my shoes. 
[00:22:30]  So they're saying, okay, that's two possible references to violence against them.  That's what they're saying.  Okay.  They hit him with a shoe, beat him down.  Okay.  I'm saying that's probably their thought process is.  Yeah, but the shit you did growing up, you got hit by, you know, you got hit with a shoe for the dumbest things, right?  Sucking my father's toes.  He would hit me with a shoe.  Get off.  What do you expect?  You should.  If you walked, really, into your house with a dress on and meaning it, not as a goof, not as, look, you know, we did this today as like some goofy thing we're doing in school, but you really meant it. 
[00:23:00]  What do you expect your father to do for real?  For real.  It gives me some problems.  For real?  I don't know.  He may yell.  He may say, what are you doing?  The fucking weekend is coming up and I have to go out and you're going to get a stain on that and you know I need it.  I don't know what my father would have done.  He probably would have looked at me like, he probably thought I was kidding.  I guess you would hope he would, like, sit down with you and have a discussion, but I think most dads would throw something at you. 
[00:23:30]  Like, what the fuck?  You hope he would say, what the fuck?  Exactly.  What would your dad do?  Oh, my God.  My dad was pretty cool, but I do believe that he would have a what the fuck moment.  My dad didn't want me playing with a puppet without strings because he said it was a doll, and it was, and I cried.  But it depends on what you're, like, I think a lot of parents know that they're kids gay because you can just, you can tell by the way someone talks sometimes or, like, the things that they like.  If you just came home.  Is it stupid to say this is different than being gay, though? 
[00:24:00]  But I'm coming home in a dress as a male.  Exactly.  Well, you could just be a transvestite and not be gay.  I think, no, it's not.  I was going to say I think that, you know, people in general are getting used to, you know, the gay community, but that's not even really true.  This is, like, the next level of that, isn't it, Jimmy?  I think that, um, let's try to, I mean, there's still a lot of people that got to get a little more comfortable with the gay community.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  And now you're throwing us this little piece of the puzzle into the mix?  A father would probably freak out if he wasn't expecting it.  Like, I think, again, like I said, a lot of parents probably know that their kid is, like, you can tell.  So, like, it progresses.  Like, you know, he plays with, whatever he does, he does, and all of a sudden you find out that he's hanging out with boys, he doesn't like girls, then you're kind of adapting to it.  But if all of a sudden your kid, you think he's into girls and he's a straight kid, comes home when he's 14, and he's got a sundress, and he goes, who's a pretty girl?  And you go, wait a minute, what's going on?  Who's a pretty girl?  First of all, you are. 
[00:25:00]  But second of all, what are you doing?  It might throw somebody for a loop.  So then this continues.  Then, you know, Glad got involved, and others, and they demanded an apology.  Arnie declined to apologize on the grounds that he was joking.  And that's...  I was only joking.  And I guess that's where it should have ended, but unfortunately, you know, in regular radio, you can't just say that anymore.  No.  You can't just say, look, I was joking.  Sorry.  Tough shit.  Dumb Arnie should have apologized.  I'll tell you why.  Dumb Arnie. 
[00:25:30]  Because he should have realized that this is terrestrial radio, and your fucking gig is going to get canceled.  So just say you're sorry, and then just move on.  Unfortunately, that's the way it's got to be, because now they're going to lose their gig if they don't do it right.  But, you know, as a radio guy, you should be able to just say, look, I was just joking.  Of course.  It's obvious.  Listen to the tape as much as you want.  I was joking.  Yeah.  What do you want from me?  They joke about all sorts of weird shit, you know, on TV and in the movies.  I think it's my right to be allowed to do that without, you know, an uproar.  And, all right, so on the grounds that he was joking and not actually advocating violence against children, he said, I didn't do anything wrong. 
[00:26:00]  Good.  Good.  Unfortunately, you know, then the program director and the general manager, they sit you down, and it's a whole different world that we live in, especially in radio.  We know that world very well.  Unbelievable.  In response to controversy, Snapple, well, the list goes on and on, pulled their advertising from the station.  Pulled.  Nissan has also announced that they will not renew their contract, their advertising contract. 
[00:26:30]  Despite all this, the Rob Barney and Dawn show still maintains the policy.  If you listen long enough, everyone will become offended by what we say.  That old gag.  Yeah, we kind of say that.  We say that, but it never really works, to tell you the truth.  No.  Just never really works.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I was walking down.  It's me.  I'll give you the exact street.  Columbus Avenue yesterday.  Ooh.  And there were three or four black Utes.  Yeah.  On the corner, just hanging out. 
[00:27:00]  I heard the N-word.  Honestly, I didn't actually keep track.  Was I driving by?  Out of my window.  I hope he realized he was just muttering.  He was yelling, get out of the way, get out of the way.  I didn't keep track, but it had to be close to a half dozen times.  They were just going back and forth.  Yeah.  I think it was three of them.  And one guy's like, man, you're in New Jersey.  Oh, and you're a city.  And then, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[00:27:30]  And then if we, as Whitey, not that I need to say the word, say it, there's, there's all this outrage.  Hell to pay.  And it's nothing but hatred.  It's nothing but sheer racism and hatred when you say it.  I don't understand that one.  We've had this conversation, you know, the black listeners will call and they'll say, you know, we have the right to say it because what we've been through and you guys don't have the right.  And I try to look at it as a human being thing where if you're allowed to say it, why can't I say it? 
[00:28:00]  Not that, like I said, I need to walk around saying the word, but it just enrages me that, that that's going on out there.  The word has really lost a lot of its meaning if, if, if most of, uh, the black community is thrown around like it's nothing.  Yeah, it really has.  And, and just to, to instantly put the hate label on something, like just because, uh, you're talking about it, you know, take the context, take the context that it's, it's, it's in, but no, you know, you can't. 
[00:28:30]  It's a weird world.  So what do we got on the, uh, hold on, I'm, I'm adding something.  Let's see.  One, two, three, four.  Uh-oh.  What do you got, Jimmy?  What do you got?  One, two, three.  Give me a, okay.  Pregnant man, Thomas Beattie gives birth for second time.  Beattie, Beattie.  Yes, Tweaky.  Tweaky.  Beattie, Beattie.  Why not all the media coverage for the second kid?  Yeah.  Well, it's just not as.  It never gets as much attention.  We really do adapt quickly as Americans, don't we?  Ah, it's old hat.  Yeah.  Guy gave birth. 
[00:29:00]  Second guy on the moon.  I know.  Who?  This is not.  What bothers me is the media loves saying his in pregnancy.  It's their own delight at writing.  This inaccuracy.  He gave birth.  And it's like, Thomas Beattie can be a man legally.  Yeah.  But according to nature, if you can give birth, you're a woman.  A woman.  That's the reason.  Whether you like it or not, there are certain.  Birds fly.  Women give birth.  Gay people can get married, as far as I'm concerned. 
[00:29:30]  Gay people can do whatever the fuck they want.  But when it comes to nature, you're not a man if you're giving birth.  All right.  Let's slow down on that.  Be real.  I like your theory, but in nature, seahorses?  Yeah.  Seahorse.  I love seahorses.  Lighthouses.  If you don't like them, you suck.  Is that the line?  You're going to have to replay that today.  Ant, you know a little something about it.  Yes, the male seahorse.  Oh, okay.  It actually gives birth.  Gives birth.  But then why don't they just call it the female?  Exactly. 
[00:30:00]  So they should...  No, for real.  I couldn't agree more.  Could somebody explain that one to me?  It's probably one of those things where, and I'm not sure, but it probably is one of those  things where they just hold the eggs.  So what?  And during the gestation period.  So the female seahorse has the eggs.  Yeah.  So call that the sperm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just say their sperm's big.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You think it's bad to hold a girl's purse in the mall?  Poor seahorse is going to hold the eggs.  Like, what the fuck?  Do you hold these eggs?  But you're right, Jimmy.  I like your theory. 
[00:30:30]  The word his or mister, I circled them all.  This is a very short...  It's not even a page long.  And maybe they love writing it.  It's like...  Can you hit the button bell every time there's a male reference to Thomas Beattie?  Oh.  That's a whole story.  Thomas Beattie, believed to be the world's first pregnant man, has believed, first of  all, to be the world...  What?  Has given birth to his second child in America.  The transgendered man gave birth to a healthy baby boy, as yet unnamed, who joins Mr. Beattie's 
[00:31:00]  one-year-old daughter, Susan Gillette.  Or Juliet.  Announcing his pregnancy in an interview with Barbara Walters in the U.S. last November,  Mr. Beattie said,  I feel good.  I had my checkups with my hormone level, as far as the HCG, and everything is right on  track.  When Susan was born last year, Mr. Beattie told People Magazine,  the only thing different about me is that I can't breastfeed my baby.  But a lot of mothers don't.  Let me jump in here.  You're right. 
[00:31:30]  Nor do a lot of fathers.  Exactly.  Why did you say that then, you know?  Yeah.  You want to be a man every other time?  Why not be a man then?  Say fathers.  A lot of dads don't.  No dads do.  Man up.  Instead, his wife, Nancy, breastfed Susan, and it is believed she will also breastfeed  the couple's new son, who was born on Tuesday, three days premature.  Sources told ABC in the U.S. that Mr. Beattie's new son was born naturally, which, let's be  honest, means via vagina.  Right.  Mr. Beattie, 35, was born a girl named Tracy Gondino, but had a gender reassignment surgery 
[00:32:00]  and is now legally male, wears a beard, and is married to Nancy.  And they neglect to mention, kind of looks like George Michael with that beard.  Despite changing his gender, Mr. Beattie...  There's another one there.  There you go.  ...had kept his female organs so that he could fall pregnant one day.  After his daughter's birth last year, Mr. Beattie told ABC News that he wanted to expand  his family so that he did not go back into his male hormones in order to be able to fall 
[00:32:30]  pregnant again.  Both babies were conceived via sperm donors.  First of all, fall pregnant.  Why are they saying that?  You don't fall pregnant.  Whoops.  Mr. Beattie went...  You fall un-pregnant.  With any luck.  Mr. Beattie went public about his first unusual pregnancy by posing semi-naked and holding his  heavily pregnant stomach on the cover of the National American Game Magazine, The Advocate.  The announcement made headlines around the world that is believed Mr. Beattie was the  first man to become pregnant. 
[00:33:00]  He said the international attention, some positive, but much of it negative, was shocking.  But he does not regret his decision to go public about his family, despite still receiving  death threats.  We are a man, a woman, and a child.  It's ironic that we are so different yet, but just a family, just the same as everyone  else.  Mr. Beattie said in November.  Wow.  Amazing.  They love writing that.  Oh, do they like that.  And as human beings, you're not a pregnant man. 
[00:33:30]  That's the only thing that annoys me.  The fact that the guy would...  They would get death threats is kind of sickening.  But just let's be honest.  You're a woman by birth.  You're giving birth to a woman.  If you have a vagina and a baby comes out of it, legally, I don't care what you call  yourself.  I don't care what you say, legally, the fucking nature has said you're a woman because your  vagina is opening up.  You're just changing the outside a little bit.  Your vagina is opening up.  But you're just changing the outside a little bit.  Yeah.  That's all.  You're not changing deep inside of what you really are. 
[00:34:00]  Sure.  If you wanted to be a man, here's what I would agree, Thomas Beattie is a man.  If they went in during sexual reassignment surgery and, let's say, gave a hysterectomy  or, let's say, added a penis and testicles and then all of a sudden there was a baby,  I'd be like, motherfucker, this is a guy and he had a baby.  But no.  If you keep your vagina, that's just not commitment.  Yeah.  You want to be a guy?  Get rid of the vagina.  Got that guy.  Learn to read a map.  That thing is ridiculous.  I know.  What is that thing? 
[00:34:30]  That's a book.  Buck Angel.  Buck Angel is a...  We had Buck call the show, right?  Yeah.  Buck Angel.  Buck is ridiculous.  Buck was born a...  Was Buck born a woman?  A pretty hot woman.  And a fairly nice vagina.  She was kind of a model.  Really?  She was a model.  Do you have any pre-Buck pictures?  Yeah, we went over this.  She had, like, short...  Yeah.  And now she has, like, facial hair and tattoos.  Is she a hangout?  And just a man body built.  No, there's still a vagina there.  But I'm saying that's where Buck Angel goes.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  That's Buck Angel before, huh?  Not bad, right?  No, sexy, actually.  Not that bad.  Would you ever go down on Buck Angel?  I don't think I could.  Even though...  No, I couldn't.  I'll tell you why.  It's the fucking bald head and the...  It's the American chopper mustache that drives me nuts.  The tats I can handle.  What if Buck Angel was laying over the bed, ass up, pillow over the head, and arms? 
[00:35:30]  I would be willing to...  And there's a vagina.  If I didn't have to hear a Vic Tabak voice, I would probably put my dick in Buck Angel.  Who's looking?  Vic Tabak.  The fucking mustache is what would get me in the bald head.  Well, yeah.  Do you think it still smells like a woman?  I don't know.  Oh, with the sunglasses on.  Look it high.  You want to fuck me?  I'd fuck me.  World's first pregnant man.  Stop it!  That'd be funny to pull your pants down like you were doing the tuck in a bar and go,  ooh, ooh, ooh, and then just open your legs and go, ah, where'd my dick go? 
[00:36:00]  I think if you have sex with Buck Angel, you want to have sex with a guy.  Yeah.  I don't care if Buck Angel still has a vagina.  No, I think if you kiss Buck Angel.  If you fuck Buck Angel from the back, you're just a good egg.  I think if you kiss Buck Angel, you probably want to have a homosexual encounter.  What's worse?  Fucking Buck Angel.  Or, uh, or a, a, one of those really hot trannies.  What's worse?  Let's hope fucking Buck Angel.  I've never done that. 
[00:36:30]  God, that's both.  Both of those are rough.  That's, uh, that's tough.  That is tough.  Uh, by the way, 30.  Goddamn, Danny.  Just pops up a cavalcade of hardcore pornography.  Tube 8 rules.  We're looking for Buck, uh, an angel video.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, let's get a Buck Angel video going.  Come on.  Gotta bring some hotness to the show.  Oh, do we?  And you rang the bell 32 times in that story.  It was 32. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you, Walton Jersey.  In a relatively short story.  Yeah, the reason I was trying to go over it is because the mister, I didn't want to count as much.  You're like the New York Times or whatever will write mister or miss for everything.  So I wanted to go more his and her, but.  Why do they so easily just buy into that story?  Because they feel.  Instead of kind of going, I don't know about this.  Yeah.  Everyone else is saying this is now a man, but I still see, uh, him, her, it as a female.  Right.  It's fun to write, and it's interesting.  That's what it is.  And I find this Buck, I find, I find Thomas Beattie to be a bit of an attention whore. 
[00:37:30]  That's my issue, is the attention seeking of it.  It's not the, the fact that, hey, if you want to have a beard and say we're husband and wife  and I gave birth, that's fine.  But you're, you're not genetically a, a, a, a, a, a male who's giving birth.  So don't write it like that.  Right.  I guess my annoyance is more the media who is writing it like there's a genetic male  giving birth, which would be impossible.  That's ridiculous.  Let's say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hello.  Uh, I just wanted to mention the, uh, the reason the, uh, seahorse is considered a male and 
[00:38:00]  gives birth is because of the chromosomes.  A seahorse, uh, male seahorse has the XY chromosome, female has an XX.  And Thomas Beattie, even if he had a cock, would still be a female because, uh, she would  still have the double X chromosome.  So it's a really weird line.  Cause again, if Thomas Beattie is, is, is, it wants to be identified as a male and has  had that surgery, I don't mind saying, yeah, Thomas Beattie is a male fine legally, whatever.  But when it comes to giving birth, there are certain things, which despite how we evolve 
[00:38:30]  as a society, despite how we look at gay people or straight people, however you look  at things genetically, females of our species give birth, the males provides, I mean, it's  just the way it is.  That's just the thing that you can't change.  And the ultimate definition, I think, right?  Yeah.  Hey, uh, can we at least leave that alone?  You want to get married?  Fine.  Get married.  You want to live together?  You want to do everything?  Fine.  Do all of it.  But can we at least have that?  The one thing fucking men do is provide sperm.  And the one thing women do is take it.  God love them. 
[00:39:00]  Let's say hi to Megan in D.C., a marine biologist.  Uh-oh.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Megan.  How are you?  I was the one who talked to you about the underwater hotel.  Oh.  Oh, you were the one?  Yeah.  Stupid underwater hotel.  And I forgot to tell you guys that all the boats around the underwater hotel released  all of their shit into the water so that all the ships floating by the windows outside  the underwater hotel.  It's got to be hilarious.  She loves talking about the underwater hotel.  I know.  She hates it.  But you attack there?  She hates it.  You can't stand it. 
[00:39:30]  Why?  Do you hate it?  What did that hotel do to you?  Jesus Christ.  Fucking.  What's her name?  Oh, fucking Ann Nicole Smith doesn't hate the hard rock as much as you hate that underwater  hotel.  All right.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Well, I wanted to tell you about the seahorse because, first of all, you can't compare fish  to mammals.  Because fish have external fertilization.  And so the eggs and the sperm are outside of both of the bodies.  But then once the eggs fertilize, then the male seahorse kind of puts it under a little 
[00:40:00]  flap of his skin and he does parental care.  And so it's not like he's giving birth.  It's like he's taking care of the eggs until they develop.  Is it like the penguins?  They just kind of hang out and do it like the penguins will just male penguins will hold  the egg while the women fucking hike back 50 miles and get a fish and bring it back.  Jimmy, they can't hold the egg.  Their little feet try to just keep it in one place for three or four months.  Oh, and they just put a little flap of skin over it and keep it warm?  Remember our bid on that?  We did, I think, an hour and a half on those dumb penguins.  And how if the male or the penguin is passing the egg to the female and drops it, the kid 
[00:40:30]  dies.  So you always know the guys that want to stay single because the woman will show back and  the guy will go, here you go, oops-a-daisy, and just kind of crack the egg.  Oh, well, things happen.  I'm going to go watch the game.  I like the oops-a-daisy moment they have where the egg just rolls away.  And they both look at it.  They just look at it like, well, I don't have hands.  You don't have hands.  We're fucked.  Guess we're fucked here.  She just looks down.  He just goes, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, it's just my...  Did you guys hear about the homosexual penguins in the Bronx Zoo? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they're, like, taking care of a...  Yeah, they booted all the female penguins out of their little enclosure and they decided  to raise their little babies alone.  Okay.  That has anything to do with being homosexual as far as...  I just like talking about the penguins.  They're, like, exhausting.  All right, bye, guys.  Happy birthday to me.  Thank you, Megan.  Horrid life of a penguin.  Just exhausting.  How many miles have they walked for?  A lot.  They waddle.  And then they go back.  What are they doing?  They have wings that are fucking virtually worthless. 
[00:41:30]  They can't even jerk off.  They have no hands.  Stupid claw feed.  Penguins are idiots.  They've been around long enough to adapt.  What are you doing?  Why are you still walking?  My dream is to put a penguin on a console at, like, at face height and just give it a good  gut punch for no reason.  Because it's never been gut punched because penguins don't have fists.  No.  So it would just kind of look at me like, wah, wah.  And I would just yell, shut up, and gut punch it.  I wouldn't know why you were doing it.  No.  Then throw it a fish.  He'd be all confused.  Why is Marcos mad?  I think we made our point on Thomas Beattie. 
[00:42:00]  Marcos, what are you doing?  We did.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, no, I was just thinking, listening to this story, it really pisses me off, man,  because they keep making it seem like he's a man.  It's a chick with no tits.  That's it.  With facial hair.  Well, yeah, we made...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  We made that point, and to me, just because legally, I don't mind, Thomas Beattie, if you  have a surgery and you want to be declared a male legal, I don't have a problem with that,  but it's like when you're talking about giving birth, there is a reality that the females 
[00:42:30]  in our species are the ones capable of giving birth.  No, and you know what?  If you're going to be a man, go all in.  You know what I'm saying?  Get a sausage, put something down there, get a donkey dick, whatever you got to do.  Sew it on there.  Can I put a donkey dick on there?  I don't think you'd want a donkey dick.  It sounds good in theory, but it would smell like an informant.  Who would want that?  Sounds good in theory, doesn't it?  Yes, a big donkey sounds wonderful in theory.  You might as well go all in.  You're right, Marcos.  All right, boys.  Thank you. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Will on Long Island.  Will.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the man giving birth.  I have somebody in my class who's like that, and four years ago when I first met this,  I'll say the thing, she had long hair and stuff, and then all of a sudden, as the years  progressed, she started growing a beard, and now she's standing next to me in the bathroom  taking a piss in the urinal.  It just pisses me off.  Why?  It's just disgusting because she'll still play the card to get out of class. 
[00:43:30]  It's like, oh, I'll have my period, and she'll leave class, and the teacher won't say nothing  to her.  It's just wrong, man.  It's like, you know, it's either you're a girl or you're a guy.  And to me, we call her Shim.  So, you know, it just pisses me off, and I just wanted to comment.  I don't know, man.  Like, people, I don't understand the thinking, but it's like, I don't know, does nature make  mistakes like that?  Like, I'm a woman and a man's butt? 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  I just don't fucking know.  Nature makes mistakes, obviously.  If you look at people who are retarded or who are born with one leg or two heads.  You rock.  Yeah.  But I'm saying, like, nature doesn't always do things perfectly, so it's like, could you  be born in the wrong body or feel like you're the wrong...  I don't know.  Maybe you can.  Yeah, well, she just comes across that she's the toughest thing walking, and she'll kick  the shit out of any guy.  It's just...  And then she'll play the card that she has her period.  She has to get out of class.  It just pisses me off.  That's all.  All right, so you feel she's inconsistent and just irritating as a person? 
[00:44:30]  Absolutely.  Okay.  There you go.  But her stand next to me in the urinal, that would never bother me.  A young lady taking a tinkle standing?  What's wrong with that?  I fucking respect that.  Pulling up her dress?  I wouldn't mind.  How are you, madam?  That's weird.  That's weird.  Especially for high school, man.  Yeah.  Oh, you're in high school?  Yeah.  What's that?  You're in high school?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm in college.  Okay.  Because you're going to get teased.  I mean, it's reality.  You're never not going to get teased. 
[00:45:00]  You're going to get teased in high school if you're fucking, if you're quote unquote  normal and, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Believe me.  You get teased if you have a dumb zit.  Of course you're going to get teased if you're wearing a dress and going into the men's  room.  Come on.  That's what life's all about.  Yeah.  Rob, Arnie, and Dawn, we go backwards again.  Here's the actual audio.  Oh.  Just quick.  Quick little snippets.  And you want to come out and say, well, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body and have surgery.  You're a freak.  I think you're a freak.  And I have every right.  Freak.  To call you that and check. 
[00:45:30]  Looks like Dawn, as the whole, was trying to save the show.  Was trying to.  Was she saying you're a freak?  Was she agreeing?  Maybe she was agreeing.  I wasn't sure.  Oh, really?  Let me hear that again.  Listen to the girl in the back.  And you want to come out and say, well, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body and have  surgery.  You're a freak.  I think you're a freak.  And I have every right to call you that and check.  I can't tell what she's saying.  I can't tell if she's going.  I mean, it's not a freak.  Jesus.  Or you're a freak.  If she's the whole, come on.  Yeah, she's got to be sticking up.  She's playing the other side.  A boy that wears a dress is a freak. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  He's a nut.  No, you can hear.  Okay.  She's annoying me just because she's fucking playing the typical whole radio show.  She's the whole.  I don't like his attitude about a boy who wears a dress is a freak.  I think somebody needs to fucking maybe just look at things a little differently.  Maybe at night somebody likes to put stockings on or something.  Maybe in the comfort of his own home.  Or a suite in Thailand.  Yeah.  Oh, we'll get to that story a little bit.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh.  A wig.  How do you not love him?  How much stimulation do you need?  What are you, do you need a phone in your hiney?  Relax, baby.  Jesus.  Can't you just jerk off?  You're going to choke yourself with a wig and a drip.  We get it.  Stock fish nets.  You think he has to line it all up?  All right, I've got to do all this stuff.  I'm not going to get off.  Look at all my goodness I have to choose from.  Yes.  I can't wait.  How do I choose?  Choose only two, Kane.  I can't wait to talk about that one.  All right, so what else did they say? 
[00:47:00]  This transgender movement in America is so phony.  God forbid if my son put on a pair of high heels, I would probably hit him with one of  my shoes.  I would throw a shoe at him because you know what?  Boys don't wear high heels.  Do you hear her?  I'm just listening to her.  At first, Rob.  And then, oh, you're awful.  Oh, she is playing up the whole part perfectly.  She should not even have been fired or spend it or anything. 
[00:47:30]  And if they were a funny show, though, he would have said if my son came home wearing high heels,  I'd hit him with my jellies or my cloth.  He would have made a joke out of him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That would have made a joke like some type of female shoe.  Like he, too, wears the shoes.  Exactly.  It turns the whole thing around.  It makes it hysterical.  It makes it fun for everybody.  And probably would have got him off the hook.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not.  For old times' sake.  I think it's ridiculous to even think that I'm advocating for violence against kids there. 
[00:48:00]  Okay, that's what we call it.  I know a lot of people don't understand this.  That's a joke.  Okay, and you know what?  Maybe you find that to be a tasteless joke, but I have never advocated for parents to beat their children.  I have, in some cases.  Yeah, absolutely.  It doesn't have to do with sexuality.  It's got to do with your kids are fucking annoying in a restaurant.  Most of us at our age got beat as kids. 
[00:48:30]  Of course we did.  Of course we did!  Well, there you go.  Wonderful.  We should take a break.  We got more Sully cockpit audio.  Yeah, yeah.  And I was really enjoying it before the show.  Oh, I love this stuff.  This is the new cockpit recordings.  I guess they did a whole investigation on the thing.  Is Sully flying?  Yeah, he is.  He's up there somewhere today.  Oh, yeah, Sully could be up there just cruising around the skies.  They always love when they see him on a plane.  Is he playing that up or you never see him? 
[00:49:00]  Now it's bad because all he wants to do is land in the water now and be a hero.  And show off.  So he shows off and everyone gets wet.  He does somersaults.  He just does all this weird shit.  He lands in fucking fields on the highway.  He refuses to land at airports.  Because they've overheard him.  He's like, airports are for pussies.  They're like, this guy's a problem.  But you know what?  You got to feel good if he's your pilot because the odds of it happening twice, just mathematically, 
[00:49:30]  are horrible.  But watch.  They're like, boy, we're in good hands with Sully.  Now watch him die just doing a regular landing because he forgets to put the brakes on.  And he fucking jumps over onto the turnpike.  He does something so stupid that a first-year pilot would know not to do.  It's pilot error.  He turned the engines off at 10,000 feet.  Like when he wants to land, instead of descending, he just points the nose from 35,000 and plunges down.  And he forgets what he's supposed to do.  He's a stunt pilot now.  With a 747. 
[00:50:00]  We also have a great, it's now a great grandmother, not a grandmother aunt.  Oh, really?  This is your video clip and audio clip of the day.  Yeah, I'd love to.  It's not going to get better than this one.  72-year-old great-grandmother tased.  She must have been getting a little rambunctious.  And a few people were listening to John Montone like you were on the way in.  On the way in.  I couldn't read their instant feedback because we got into some things. 
[00:50:30]  But you want to explain this one for after the break?  The subject was, as John Montone said, big gay ice cream.  Yes.  You got it?  Oh, we love Montone.  After the break, my friends.  Opie and Anthony starring little Jimmy Norton.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, we got American Idol news.  Oh.  Adam Lambert admits he's gay.  What? 
[00:51:00]  That's crazy.  Wow.  You mean, you mean he's gay?  I never saw that coming.  Wow.  Look at that picture of him kissing another man, open mouth, right there on the internet,  pulled up in two seconds.  Just why you surprised?  Oh, literal Jim.  He knew the whole time he was going to tell the world he's gay.  He was just waiting for a good opportunity.  Did he have to tell anyone? 
[00:51:30]  Come on now.  Well, he figured he would, you know, get a Rolling Stone cover out of it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he did.  He admits in the new Rolling Stone, so.  And you made a good point about that.  The actual winner of American Idol.  Oh, yeah.  That's one guy.  Doesn't want to be confused.  You know, because you know how people get.  They get confused very easily out there.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet you there's a lot of people that think the winner of American Idol is gay.  Yeah, yeah.  They kind of brought this up this morning.  The guy probably goes around going, yeah, I won American Idol.  Oh, oh, you're the guy. 
[00:52:00]  And you came out finally in Rolling Stone.  No, that was the second place guy.  See, I'm the winner guy, and I like the pussy.  Who's the guy who won?  I don't know.  No one knows.  I don't remember.  I don't know.  The second place guy is getting way more attention.  He's actually changing his name, the winner, because he actually does not want to be confused.  His new name now, which I think is going to be hard to put on an album, is Tits Pussy Lover.  McGillicuddy.  Imagine if he called himself Tits Pussy Lover McGillicuddy, and just did country music. 
[00:52:30]  In other Idol news, Chris Daughtry.  Yeah.  He also came in, what, second, third?  What did he do?  I don't even think he was the runner-up.  No, he might have been third or something like that.  His voice is ridiculous, and his new video is all over the internet.  Check it out.  When stupid, what's his name, won?  I don't know.  Taylor Hicks, I think.  Oh, he was the Taylor Hicks year?  I think it was.  All right.  I think.  Oh, Chris Allen is the winner. 
[00:53:00]  Chris Allen.  This year.  I didn't watch one episode.  I could give a flying fuck-a-roonie.  Travis is telling me Chris Daughtry was fourth.  Fourth?  Yeah.  Fourth place.  Who was third that year?  Exactly.  Who was second?  Exactly.  I think you had, wow, Taylor, oh, wow.  Taylor Hicks.  I watched that year, too.  Taylor Hicks won it all.  It's the last year I really watched them.  Kelly Pickler was in that year.  Was she?  I believe so. 
[00:53:30]  American Idol.  12 contestants.  Oh, wow.  This was the year everybody watched.  Help us out.  I've got to make sure this is the right year.  No, that's the Sanjaya year.  Sanjaya.  That's the Sanjaya year.  So then it was the year before that.  Yeah, it's been a few years now.  Taylor Hicks.  Kelly Pickler.  Yeah, okay.  Chris Daughtry.  It was Taylor Hicks.  Who else?  Who was the runner-up?  Elliot Yameen. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, right.  Elliot Yameen, the guy with the fucked up teeth that he got fixed.  He actually is doing very well.  He's got a hit out there.  And he was the runner-up?  No.  We got Taylor Hicks.  Catherine McPhee.  Yeah, and then Elliot Yameen.  Catherine McPhee.  Oh, right, right, right.  Not much.  That's right.  She sang somewhere over the rainbow that year.  Yeah.  She's just kind of like hanging around Hollywood.  Daughtry, fourth place.  Oh, yeah.  Pickler.  Kelly Pickler.  Remember Ace? 
[00:54:30]  Ace.  Ace.  Ace.  That's the one my sister was in love with.  He was fourth, Chris Daughtry?  Yeah.  And he had the biggest career, right?  Of course.  Do you think they just knew that whatever they do with him, they had to boost other guys  up?  It's the voting.  They know he's going to.  He should have won it all.  But it's the voting, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know.  It just doesn't.  I think they just bullshit that whole thing, to tell you the truth.  They know exactly where to put everybody to make the most, to squeeze the most money  out of their friggin' stable. 
[00:55:00]  Who's this guy?  You don't remember this guy?  Oh, the little toady bird.  Chicken Hawk or whatever.  Chicken Hawk, right.  Or Chicken Little.  Chicken Little.  Chicken Hawk is a fucking pedophile.  Chicken Hawk is a pedophile.  Talk about a little.  Talk about a po-far.  A po-far.  I think Chicken Little was in Big Brother.  There was a Chicken, or Chicken George.  Chicken George was in Roots.  As a matter of fact.  There was a Chicken George in Big Brother, my friend.  Chicken George will be here, I believe, tomorrow. 
[00:55:30]  Fuck that.  Ben Vereen.  Ben Vereen will be, not on our show, but he'll be doing an interview.  Oh, I love Ben Vereen.  What about the crooner?  I hate the crooner on American Idol.  Remember the crooner?  I'm the crooner.  Get up there, and it would just be all out of place and awkward.  Hit me with your best shot.  And the winner of, this is Ben Andy, the winner of American Idol is the only guy Regis would 
[00:56:00]  make a gay comment to.  Yeah.  So I hear you've come out of the closet, you're a homosexual.  No, Regis.  That's the other guy.  That's the other guy.  You mean the handsome gentleman?  You know the ladies must be all over him.  I actually believe.  He must go home with a new lady every night.  No, Regis.  He's gay.  Right.  What?  Joy told me.  Shut up.  Sully cockpit audio.  Cock.  What are we learning today, Ant?  We didn't learn the last time the audio was out. 
[00:56:30]  Not too much.  They were just doing an investigation.  So they got a little deeper into what was going through Sully's mind, and the co-pilot  has a little more input here, and they're doing this investigation on how to handle this  stuff, how the crew could handle emergencies better, bird strikes, things like that.  It's kind of a whole investigation on the whole thing that happened and how they could  better handle things if other instances like this pop up.  No, it scares me, so we land a plane in the Hudson River, it turns out it's birds, and 
[00:57:00]  we're still not killing birds.  When are we going to start killing the birds?  They said this was a very rare case.  They were migratory birds, which were in flight, not the birds that kind of hang out around the  airport.  How many birds do we need?  Just start killing them.  They're doing something wrong.  They throw their shit everywhere.  Until birds learn manners, I say we just throw rocks at them.  I think they purposely aim for you, too, when they're in the trees above. 
[00:57:30]  I want to apologize to the birds.  Actually, you won't see the word apologize in this apology letter that I'm apologizing  with.  But birds are people, too.  The word apology does not appear in this letter.  But if the word apology does not appear, then it should not be in the letter, but it is in  the letter.  So it is appearing, but it does not appear.  It does not compute.  It does not compute.  Take us out of here, warp factor one.  Sully, cockpit audio. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  Cactus 1539.  It's birds.  It's lost thrust on both engines.  Returning back towards LaGuardia.  Okay.  You need to return to LaGuardia.  Turn left heading of 220.  220.  Star, stop your departure.  He's got emergency returning.  Who is it?  It's 1529.  He, uh, bird strike.  He lost all engine.  He lost the thrust in the engine.  He's returning immediately.  Now that, we heard already, I think.  That we kind of heard.  I thought we were going to get some cockpit audio.  I do believe we're going to have, uh, some...  Cockpit. 
[00:58:30]  Look how smooth he is.  Uh, we hit birds.  We hit birds.  Uh, engines are gone.  Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't really care.  Uh, I'm suicidal.  They are fucking amazing how calm these guys are.  I know.  I would be panicking.  Birds!  Dead!  Help!  Birds!  Help!  Help!  He's yelling, help!  Wings!  I'd be flapping in the cockpit.  What are you doing?  Wings!  He's trying to fly.  The average person panics when he gets a flat tire going.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know. 
[00:59:00]  I know.  I know.  Controllers immediately began clearing other traffic  for a possible emergency return to LaGuardia.  Act is 1529.  We can get it for you.  Do you want to try to land 101-3?  We're unable.  We may end up in the Hudson.  Sullenberger's voice never wavered, but his badly crippled plane and the 155 people on  board were running out of good options.  Act is 1549.  Runway 4 is available if you want to make left traffic to runway 4.  Oh, gee, thanks.  I'm not sure we can make any runway. 
[00:59:30]  What's over to our right?  Anything in New Jersey?  Maybe Teterboro?  Okay, yeah.  Off your right side is Teterboro Airport.  Do you want to try to go to Teterboro?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  And he's like, what's that off to my right?  Is that that Teterboro with that little fucking narrow shit little runway?  Is that Pat from Monaki's trailer at the end of the runway?  Pat would have been wiped out.  It's my plane.  Oh, well.  Keep my legacy alive, guys. 
[01:00:00]  I love Pat.  Pat, you will.  Pat from Monaki.  The jetliner, now a glider, was losing speed at altitude.  Cactus 1529, turn right 280.  You can land runway 1 at Teterboro.  We can't do it.  Okay, which runway would you like at Teterboro?  We're going to get to Hudson.  I'm sorry.  Say again, Cactus?  The stunned controller never got an answer.  Hudson Airport.  We're going to Hudson. 
[01:00:30]  Hudson, what?  He's looking at his charts.  I don't see a Hudson Airport.  Let's say hi to Robert in North Carolina.  Hey there, Bab.  Welcome aboard, Bob.  Gentlemen, I was just calling to say that in pilot training, the first thing they teach  you is to sound cool on the radio no matter what.  Just to keep the situation calm and in case you die, then at least everyone says you died  sounded really cool.  Go on.  They could tell you that, but...  They say step one, sound cool on the radio.  It's true. 
[01:01:00]  Keep it calm.  It has nothing to do with you.  If you're freaking out, you're freaking out.  Yeah, how do you teach calm?  You freak out in the airplane, and then you act cool when you talk to people outside the  airplane.  So basically, they say no pants shitting in the cockpit.  You can shit your pants, but just don't sound...  Oh, don't let anybody know you shit your pants, sir.  Okay.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's do one more here.  With the plane dropping low over the George Washington Bridge and below radar coverage,  Sullenberger and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, focused solely on the river in front of them. 
[01:01:30]  Tactics 1549, radar contact is lost.  Controllers now were blind, but two helicopters had flight 1549 in view as the plane inched  closer to the water.  Flying past him right now.  Looks like he's sitting low.  Going down.  In the water.  Roger.  I'm curious that they are deploying the route right now.  There was better stuff in the paper today. 
[01:02:00]  I thought there was...  I thought there was...  I thought what I saw earlier was some chatter from between the pilots and the co-pilot.  What the fuck, dude?  You know, these guys are trained to land, and they fucking trained to do this shit, dude.  It's what they do.  I don't know why they're making such a fucking big deal about it, dude.  You know what, dude?  What happens when they face a situation where it's a little... 
[01:02:30]  They're just...  Stupid Bob.  We love the Bob Kelly impression, Jimmy.  Stupid Bobby.  Dude!  Shh, sh-sh-sh-mommy.  That's the best one.  Shh, sh-mommy.  Colin and I were talking about it the other night, and Colin said,  because Bob always messes up the words.  Like, if you write a lot and do a lot of new material,  Bob always means to say you're prolific, but he says you're profound.  You know what, dude?  You think you're so profound. 
[01:03:00]  And Colin's like, you mean prolific?  He bites his finger.  He shoots his dumb finger.  I can't wait until Colin bites his finger off and then has to explain how it happened.  Well...  That fucking cocksucker lost probably 50 pounds.  Really?  Colin looks amazing.  I was hoping he was sick.  He looks unbelievable.  Is he still doing that show?  What show?  The one-man show he was doing.  No, no, no.  That had a short run.  It got pretty good reviews from what I heard.  It was great.  But weren't they trying to pick that up to go lower?  Oh, I do not know.  I do not know. 
[01:03:30]  Well, Ann, I guess that's all we get then.  I thought we had more on Sully.  I thought we did, too.  Oh, well.  Sorry, peeps.  That's all right.  It's always good to hear that, though.  You know how cool, calm, and collected he is.  Cool, calm, and collected, Norton.  Well, Anthony brought this one to our attention.  We've got to play the John Montone news clip.  John Montone is a news guy here.  He's the man-on-the-street guy for the big AM news station here in New York City.  Is it 10-10 wins?  Yep.  And I listen on the way in, find out what's going on, get the old sports scores, the stories of the day, 
[01:04:00]  and then your little human interest story that John Montone covers.  You know, whenever the cab drivers are doing something, he talks to the cabbies.  Or all of a sudden there's a big pothole or something.  Yeah.  He does a whole report about the big pothole.  And then he interviews drivers.  It's like, well, that thing couldn't swallow up my whole car.  And they laugh, and he goes, swallow the whole car.  I'm John Montone.  Like, he'll just end it like that. 
[01:04:30]  He's got a great delivery.  Well, you know, every year we've got to spread the sand to keep the ice off the road.  Spreading the sand, keeping the ice off the road.  Spreading the sand here in Brooklyn.  In Brooklyn.  I'm John Montone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Works it into his out.  Yeah.  So today he's talking about big gay ice cream.  Big gay ice cream.  When I heard this, I turned the volume up.  I'm like, where is John Montone going with this?  You've got to listen to his story.  You do know what this is.  What?  It's the guy who will hold the cone out, and you have to run back into it. 
[01:05:00]  You don't think so.  Maybe I heard wrong.  In picking a name for his ice cream truck, Doug Quint settled on what he felt was a pretty  obvious choice.  Now, why the big gay ice cream truck?  Well, because I'm a big gay ice cream man.  Quint claims if you look at him.  Fair enough.  It's like, all right.  He could have called it heart cock ice cream, but he went with the fucking family friendly  version.  Ah, shit. 
[01:05:30]  If you look at and listen to other ice cream trucks, you'll realize they're gay, too.  Mr. Softy.  You've heard it coming down the street, and you've wondered.  He says his big gay ice cream truck is just starting to get comfortable with its personality.  The truck just came out of the closet.  I think by the end of the summer, it's going to be really flaming.  Oh, he didn't work the big gay ice cream until he was out. 
[01:06:00]  That was the second one, I guess.  I heard one where he was talking about, he goes, you could get soft serve vanilla.  He's making jokes.  And the way he said it was like, yeah, I bet you can.  He should have went all in and said soft serve chocolate.  Yeah.  You know the ice cream trucks that have those holes in the side with the dragon's mouth  where you throw the garbage?  Imagine what's going on there.  A wall.  That's hilarious.  Mommy, how come it's not the dragon's mouth?  How come his tail is lifted up over the hole? 
[01:06:30]  Mommy, what's going on here?  Why is there something sticking out of the hole in the side of that truck?  Mommy, he's spilling ice cream.  Mommy, why is there a snake poking out of the side of the ice cream?  Should I grab it?  Well, let's find the other one.  Big gay ice cream.  Can I ask a question?  No.  Sure.  I'm doing calorie count.  Uh-huh.  I'm trying to look, to trim up.  This oatmeal, how much do you think this is? 
[01:07:00]  Like, how many, how big is this?  10,000 calories.  Oh, don't go.  I couldn't think of a funny thing.  I just said, don't go.  I should have said, into Humerville, Jim.  Because I didn't.  Fucking asshole I am.  Isn't that a pint?  I don't know how much oatmeal.  It does look like a pint.  That would look like a pint of ice cream if it didn't have oatmeal in it.  Yeah.  If that makes sense.  Is this more than 16 ounces?  It says 16 ounces on the bottom.  Then it's 16 ounces.  But is that a cup?  Liquid ounces?  I don't know.  Remember?  Or 16 ounces of pounds.  I used to be a math whiz and I forgot it all. 
[01:07:30]  I'm trying to calorie count.  I don't know this stuff anymore.  And I'm entering into this program on my iPhone app.  That seems tiring.  It is.  Really?  A little calorie thing on your iPhone app?  Oh, here comes death.  Hello, death.  That's your whole daily calories.  How much do you think, Kenny?  Honestly.  I'm working on that equation now.  But eight ounces in a cup.  And I believe that's two cups.  All right.  So it's two cups.  That's not two girls.  I can really enjoy this.  How much strawberries?  A couple tablespoons. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Don't do this to yourself.  No, no.  Because I do it every day.  I know.  I know, but it just seems exhausting.  I'm just curious.  Your calorie counting?  No, no.  I enter it.  Dude, I enter it into this little program and bang.  Program.  It keeps track of your calories for the day?  It says.  And how many calories are you trying to eat?  I don't know.  Under 2,500, I guess?  Something around there?  It says I weigh about 163.  I want to get down to 150.  I want to lose like one point or two pounds a week. 
[01:08:30]  And I have to do like 1,100 calories a day.  What the fuck?  Sorry.  I didn't even hear what you said.  That's okay.  What does a healthy person need a day?  Me and Ann, we're looking at a skirt.  I really don't know.  I think it's around 2,500.  No.  What?  You might.  That's not.  Maybe you.  Is that too little?  No, it's too much.  2,500 is too much?  22 then?  I thought 1,100 is what I said I should be eating.  1,200.  A day?  A little?  A day.  No fucking way. 
[01:09:00]  I'll bet money on that one.  Why?  I think you've got to be closer to 2,000 to 2,200 calories a day.  I think.  What do I know?  I'm just a boy.  Oh, don't count calories, Jimmy.  That's exhausting.  No, you're just I want to know what I'm eating.  I understand that.  You know what you're eating.  Look at it.  On your horrible iPhone that you yell at all the time?  See?  You're having fun with it.  Look at you.  Look at you.  What's in here?  Is this water or skim milk?  Oh, wow.  Does this look tiring, Ant?  Skim.  Back me up on this one.  He's going to start going fucking crazy and obsessing on this now. 
[01:09:30]  He's writing down that it's what?  Water?  Skim.  All right.  What's the skim milk calorie count?  I don't know.  Do I have to look that up?  The way this thing is is you're not going to have time to do anything else today.  No, no.  The way this is, you enter the food, and this searches for everything, and it gets you brands  and everything.  So it tells you how many calories.  It's great.  So I'm looking now for two cups of oatmeal.  Why don't I just eat it for you?  What an asshole.  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:10:00]  Oh, Kenny, your lips are gone.  It feels good to laugh.  What an asshole.  I kind of like it.  Kenny rules in his awfulness.  My own oatmeal.  What's your fuck?  Just eat less.  I give you till Friday before you basically give up on the...  Throws his phone.  He's going to eat his iPhone.  No, but dude, I literally eat the same thing every day.  The calories in that iPhone.  Oatmeal with fruit.  Yeah.  Half cup oatmeal with milk.  Wow.  Exhausting.  You're right.  No, I'm just searching. 
[01:10:30]  I've got to just find it once.  Right.  All right.  Find it once.  I can't even argue.  It's a good point.  Just find it once.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  What kind of oatmeal am I having, Kenny?  Help me.  What are the choices, Jimmy?  There's fucking 500 of them.  Why?  Sully's calm, landing in the water.  He's freaking out with his iPhone, trying to figure out his calories.  Help me!  Is this dry oatmeal?  See?  It once was.  It once was.  This is just oatmeal. 
[01:11:00]  This could be the easiest food to figure out the calories.  This is probably Quaker Oats, right?  Something like that?  Yes.  Amazing.  Are you just saying that to shut me up?  Wait till you eat something with a sauce.  You're going to be out of your mind, Jimmy.  Oh.  Although, John in Tampa, defending a little Jimmy Norton.  Let's go to John in Tampa.  John.  Hey, boys.  I used to look like one of your typical listeners, and then I started counting calories on my phone.  And I was just going to give some advice to Jimmy.  Basically, stay above 1,200 a day, or else your body will start to starve itself, and you'll stay mushy and crap, and nothing will happen. 
[01:11:30]  But, yeah, I've been eating around 1,400, and then when I started exercising, I jumped it up to 1,700, and, you know, I'm down in almost normal range.  I don't know what oatmeal, because here's what it has.  You go to oatmeal.  Oatmeal, one quarter cup dry, 75 calories.  Then it goes, look at all the listings for oatmeal.  I'd rather be fat.  For real.  No.  I'd rather be fat.  I'd just be a big slob.  I couldn't deal with that shit.  But, dude, it's really easy if you just, all you do is.  It sounds it. 
[01:12:00]  Me and Ann are, like, sweating.  Yeah.  It's a piece of cake.  What's next?  A cooking segment?  What are you talking for the listeners?  You're on their side.  You work for them, don't you?  No, I'm just trying to be entertaining.  You work for them.  No, a cooking segment could be good.  I wish I had mind control.  So after he said that, he wouldn't know why he did it, but he would look and then just run through the window headfirst.  Jimmy, did you say oatmeal with fruit?  Yes.  All right.  Andy S. from Tennessee writes, 
[01:12:30]  Jimmy eats oatmeal with fruit, so Jimmy eats oatmeal with Steve C.  Oh, see, that's not right.  Why am I surrounded by hot, delicious food?  People are saying that 2,000 calories is normal?  Maybe.  They're right.  I'm trying to live with it.  I thought it was higher than that.  My God, man.  Yeah, but GH, you have a high metabolism because you're always active.  You ride your bike.  You do things.  Yeah, I rode to the George Washington Bridge yesterday and I rode across. 
[01:13:00]  Going to Jersey?  And I took a picture.  I swore glue.  Yeah.  I took a picture and they can't figure out how I did it.  Really?  I'm a magic man.  Really?  You want to try to figure it out?  That's your Twitter picture.  Did you see it?  Yeah, I figured it out.  You figured it out, right?  Yeah.  Why can't people figure out what I did?  They're convinced I had like a 10-foot pole and had my BlackBerry on a 10-foot pole to take this picture from a weird angle.  That's crazy.  You were riding the bike under the cables that hold the fucking bridge up.  There you go.  No one knows that. 
[01:13:30]  It's quite a stunt.  Thank you, man.  Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim?  Hey, little Jimmy.  I eat about 1,800 calories a day using the same iPhone app and I'm down 38 pounds since February.  Yeah, I just don't.  Once you find, I don't know how many ounces this is and you want to do it fairly well.  So, Jimmy, you did say it's very easy and 10 minutes later you're still trying to figure out how many calories in your oatmeal.  Probably because I don't know what I'm eating.  Like, if I had bought this in the store and said it would be Quaker Oats, I would know how much it is. 
[01:14:00]  It's pretty much Quaker Oats.  You think it's Quaker Oats?  Probably, right?  Yeah.  There's a lot of websites out there you can look it up on.  And it's probably just dry, regular oatmeal.  They put a little skim milk in it and that's it, Jim.  I don't know.  What are the choices under the oatmeal category?  Oh, dude, there's so many.  Like what?  Oats or oats?  How many grams is this?  It says serving size, 100 grams.  Remember, people, he said this is so easy.  How many? 
[01:14:30]  Wait, I have two cups.  How many fucking grams in two cups?  Grams now in two cups?  Wait, what is this?  I mean, you said it was easy.  It is.  If you have a radio show and people can tell you things, it's wonderful.  Just eat until you almost feel full and stop eating.  Normally the way I eat is this.  I eat until a log is poking out.  And then once it becomes like a circular thing, like swallow shit, swallow shit, I'm like,  I should not eat anymore for now.  Swallow shit.  That is a good barometer, by the way. 
[01:15:00]  If you eat a meal and have to go to the bathroom immediately, you're eating too much.  I need to know a serving size is 100 grams.  Remember it.  Very easy.  Easy.  It was easy.  That's the word.  Oatmeal and strawberry, which is what I'm having.  Oatmeal and a little strawberry.  Sounds very basic and very easy to figure out, Jimmy.  Just cut down on your sugars and starches.  Thank you, fucking simple Ken.  I appreciate that.  But I want to know how much I'm eating.  I don't know what a starch is.  What the fuck do I know?  What am I eating?  My shirts?  Oh, stop it. 
[01:15:30]  A cleaning joke.  All right, let me say hi to Randy in Pittsburgh.  Randy, how about those pens, huh?  Hey.  What the fuck, Randy?  How about those pens?  Yeah, game seven.  Game fucking seven on a Friday night.  I finally get to watch some playoff hockey instead of the first period and then go to bed.  Yeah.  I'm psyched for the pens.  Pens win it all this year.  You heard it here first.  Oh, no.  Pens rule.  Big comeback by the pens.  Oh, no.  I had picked the pens very early on. 
[01:16:00]  And now that Opie has picked them, it's over, Johnny.  So you're going to go with?  No, no.  I'm still going with the Penguins.  Definitely.  And they're playing who?  Oh, they're playing the other team.  The one with the octopus.  The octopus team.  The octopus team.  The Detroit.  You can do the same bit with me with movies.  You know that, right?  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Okay.  All right.  And technology.  No.  And politics.  And blah, blah.  No.  And blah, blah.  I know Kobe had a good night.  Kobe, uh...  Thirty, uh, thirty-one points, I think. 
[01:16:30]  Well, but the magic won.  I have no idea.  With that freak of nature, uh, Dwight Howard.  Oh, Dwight Howard.  What is his name?  Jimmy?  This couldn't be right.  He's still calculating.  According to this, I have eaten three percent more than my daily allowance of calories.  In just that?  No, I had four egg white omelet, which I eat.  Oh, four egg whites?  That's not that fattening at all, though.  You can't eat four egg whites and then oatmeal as your breakfast.  You're, like, training for a fighter.  If you want to lose weight, you've got to really, like, eat one meal. 
[01:17:00]  You'd have to be boxing as you're eating it.  Wait, Jimmy.  So, at 7.40, you can't eat anymore today.  You're done for the day!  Yeah, that's working real well for you, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  All right, I better...  Maybe calorie counting is not for you.  Have a water.  Thanks.  That's it.  Here's lunch and here's dinner.  Here you go.  A couple of bottles of water for you.  I don't even know if he can drink the water.  There's a few calories of water. 
[01:17:30]  So, maybe what I'll do is this.  None?  None?  I'll throw this out.  What, the iPhone?  No, the iPhone I'm going to keep.  Yeah.  Did we lose Randy yet?  Randy, what do you got?  Play through it, Randy!  Hey, this is, uh...  Jimmy, what are you, uh, Mr. Calorie Counting Man,  eating out of cups?  Hey, no how, no way.  No way.  All right.  No way.  Oatmeal.  All my calories.  One day.  But you know what?  All of it.  But I've gotten recommended,  because Steve's girl, MJ, helped me a lot with,  she's, like, helped me work out and all that stuff 
[01:18:00]  and eat healthy.  Look at Steve.  Well, Steve is just a fucking self-will run riot horse's ass.  I'm just saying, you know, it's like...  Have you seen his chick, though?  His chick's in phenomenal shape.  Yeah, of course.  She's a bodybuilder.  So, um, with obviously low self-esteem,  because, you know, Steve.  But she's really in, uh...  She's in tremendous shape,  and she's a nutritionist.  Yeah.  So she helped me with this,  and I don't know...  She's like, oatmeal is good,  you eat it in the morning,  but maybe you have to...  I don't know.  Oatmeal is terrific, too.  Maybe you don't eat that much.  It is good for you?  Oatmeal? 
[01:18:30]  But with so many calories.  No, it's not.  It depends what you put in the oatmeal.  What I'm having...  Maybe eat a little less.  I have a little strawberry.  You basically got a pint of oatmeal.  That's a lot.  That's a lot of...  Well, I only ate...  For real, that's a lot, though, Jimmy.  I only ate, like, 250...  I think...  I'll throw it out.  When I make...  I'll throw it out.  When I make oatmeal at home,  I do a double serving,  so it's three quarters of a cup of oatmeal.  That was two cups.  And then a cup and a half of water.  And that's two servings,  according to the oatmeal box.  You know what I'm going to have from now on? 
[01:19:00]  I'm going to make my own fucking oatmeal.  Especially if you're eating the banana as well,  and the egg whites.  I don't eat the cups.  Well, the egg whites are no calories.  The listener's annoyed.  Let's go to Sam.  Why?  I'm very healthy.  Oh, fuck.  Sam.  Oh, hold on.  Kenny has brought...  My second...  Look that up.  Hold on.  Thanks for the support.  Oh, shit.  You can't drink that, Jimmy.  It's a medium iced latte with soy milk.  It's not that bad.  How many calories?  I don't want to know.  I don't want to...  Now he doesn't want to know.  Two?  You got the calorie counting program in front of you. 
[01:19:30]  And boy, are the listeners pissed off.  Oh, no.  Sam, what's up?  Why are they mad?  Sam?  Sam?  Hello?  Oh, man.  You got a good phone call here.  Is it Sam?  What's your name?  I hear some wind sound in the background.  I hope he shot himself.  Everyone on the phones right now, say hi.  That usually works.  Hello?  All right.  There you go.  You, you.  Who is it?  Who is this?  Listen to the telephone, not the radio or anything. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  You.  Sam?  Sam.  Everyone say their name at once.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Hey, Dan.  We want to talk to you.  Hey, how you doing?  Sorry.  Holy shit.  I'm sorry.  I find it amazing that we can figure out how much semen fit in the studio a lot faster.  We can figure out what brand oatmeal and how much it weighs.  That's true.  We did go through that semen thing pretty quick.  We certainly did, yeah.  All right.  True.  See, they're tall.  Okay.  I need a grande coffee.  He's punching it in. 
[01:20:30]  No, no.  I had my grande coffee this morning.  I had that with a little semen thing.  You should consider this your exercise for the day.  Yeah.  You're trying to figure out the calorie count.  Yeah.  He's sweating.  He is sweating.  Low carb, fuck calories.  Wester Trucker says, Jimmy.  I know, but I'm just counting.  I'm not obsessed.  I just want to know.  I have no idea.  Oatmeal kickstarts metabolism, Greg in Oregon says.  Greg in Oregon.  Okay.  Let me go to Bob in Minnesota.  He's a nutritionist, it looks like.  Bob?  I have a feeling Bob's going to have some brutal advice.  Hello, Bob.  Hey, how are you?  Good, man. 
[01:21:00]  Okay.  Actually, I'm a doctor.  I'm not a nutritionist.  Hiya, doc.  How you doing?  Good, buddy.  Okay.  Jimmy, here you go.  You take about five ounces of oatmeal, not the prepackaged crap with the sugar and the flavors in it,  because that's really bad for you.  Yeah, this is great.  Red Quaker oatmeal, a palm full of blueberries, a teaspoon of honey, and eight ounces of orange juice.  That's about 250 calories.  All right.  Well, that's a lot.  No, it's not.  That's really nice.  Nope. 
[01:21:30]  The average intake for a guy is about 2,000 calories a day.  2,000.  All right.  So what happened was 1100 is way too low.  I put my weight at like 163, and then I wanted to lose two pounds a week.  And you have to put your activity level, and I put mildly active.  Retardive.  Then drop it down to 1,800 calories a day.  One calorie one day.  That's what I say.  I like when you say that a lot.  You know what?  Yes.  All this stuff is just bullshit.  Diets are bullshit.  Everyone knows what they have to do to lose weight. 
[01:22:00]  Of course.  But they search out these diets and things, you know, because it's an excuse.  It's an instinctive thing that you know if you're eating too much.  As a human being, someone puts a plate of cookies in front of you, and you go, well, if I want  to try to stay in shape and keep the weight off, I know I shouldn't eat that.  Everyone knows that.  If you get something, then you eat it to the point where you're stuffed, you ate too much,  and you know it.  If you're not exercising, you know you're not exercising.  It's so easy.  Things to do.  Not easy, but it's common sense.  But it's easy as far as knowing what you need to do. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  You're right.  And then it's up to you whether you want to make those sacrifices.  You don't always know, though.  And it's a discipline, too.  Because oatmeal, I didn't know oatmeal was that caloric.  I didn't know that, because I'm eating like, but the egg whites are 67 calories.  Bob makes a good point, though.  A lot of people eat oatmeal thinking it's healthy, but they get the packages with all  that sugar in there.  The flavored oatmeal is ridiculous.  You might as well eat Frosted Flakes or something.  There's no sugar in the oatmeal I eat.  Why does this Bim look familiar? 
[01:23:00]  She's on Pick...  Really?  Is she Playboy or something?  She's got no chin.  Oh, she's me.  She's a chin.  I think she's like Playmate or something.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Who is that?  We'll get a name.  Playboy International?  Playboy?  I don't know.  She's a fucker.  Familiar.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  Okay.  Nah.  Yeah, if you eat celery, you're actually getting negative calories.  So just eat a lot of celery.  It takes more energy to digest it.  That's right.  I eat celery with Snickers bars taped to it. 
[01:23:30]  But they're not really taped.  It's actually...  I use the gook from a Rolo bar.  Rolos are so good.  Oh, they fucking...  What's the other ones I love?  They come in a triangle box long thing.  Those fucking toffee things.  Oh, those...  Trollable...  Trollable...  Trollable...  Holy shit are those good!  God damn it.  I love them too, Jimmy.  Dude, I want to...  I just want to...  I want to eat that until I'm vomiting. 
[01:24:00]  There's nothing better than the...  Heath bar.  How good's a fucking Heath bar?  I don't think I like the Heath bar.  Really?  What else don't you like?  Fucking America?  Fucking the flag?  Fucking creep?  Why don't we get some Heath bars and try it out?  No!  Will that mess up your diet, Jimmy?  You'll be into tomorrow's calories already?  Ken in Texas.  Ken?  Hey, yeah.  You all had...  How you doing, fellas?  Welcome aboard.  You all had an Ultimate Fighter on last month,  and he said to eat three-quarter cups of brown rice  and six ounces of white chicken. 
[01:24:30]  Man, I lost 25 pounds in like seven weeks, guys.  That's probably Matt Hughes.  Yeah, Matt...  No, the other guy.  He was fighting Matt Hughes, right?  No, Matt Hughes was the guy we had in.  He lost to a decision, I believe, to Matt...  Oh, no, Matt...  Was it Matt Sarian or Matt Hughes?  Jesus Christ.  Matt Sarian.  Oh, yeah, he lost to Matt Hughes.  Because I would know Matt Hughes.  I'm related to him.  What's wrong with you now?  I was shocked at how quick I lost it, man.  Really, you can eat as much as you want.  Right.  And it just comes right off, fellas. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, good show.  Punching out.  Thank you, Ken.  I think that's what it comes down to.  You know what you have to do.  You know what...  You can't count until your ass is red, Jimmy.  I do.  Actually, I put my fingers in while I count.  I get nervous.  So I always put fingers in my ass.  You've already eaten too much.  You've had what?  Egg whites?  Oatmeal?  Banana?  No, I know banana.  All right.  You better throw the banana out.  And now I'm...  That's tomorrow's breakfast at this point.  I'm looking for an...  It's an iced...  It's an iced soy latte. 
[01:25:30]  Grande iced soy latte.  Not chai.  Grande.  Where's fucking grande?  God damn it.  He's just obsessing over this.  Tall, grande, soy pumpkin.  I don't want soy pumpkin.  I want my...  I take pleasure in the fact that he said how easy it is.  Pleasure for me.  Yeah.  Medium iced soy latte.  What the fuck, man?  I don't know, Jimmy.  Does Jimmy want to... 
[01:26:00]  Fill in the blank, I guess.  Booger couch.  Jimmy wants to watch.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, maybe Jimmy should just go down to North Carolina and get some Slim Jims right off  the line there.  Slim Jims.  Why would I do that?  They're fattening.  Because they're called Slim Jims.  Slim Jims.  And the plant blew up.  Yeah, the plant blew up.  That's true.  Really?  That's the story today, yes.  The Slim Jim plant exploded?  Yes.  What do you know on that?  Well, they said a bunch of people got killed and a lot of people injured.  Two killed, Dan.  Two killed at the Slim Jim explosion. 
[01:26:30]  Never heard of that happening.  What explodes in there, by the way?  I don't know.  Just goes to show you.  Oh, I saw...  It's hard to be so hurtful, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  I saw a latte grande.  I got that.  Okay.  All right, Booger.  You are being hurtful.  Later.  Word.  Hey, someone's celebrating their 30th birthday today.  We normally don't do this, but Brian, happy birthday.  Thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends. 
[01:27:00]  For coming to my birthday!  All right, here's Rich in Buffalo.  Lost 110 pounds on Weight Watchers.  Rich?  Morning, guys.  Welcome aboard.  Congratulations on that.  What I want...  I want to jump right in.  So, you lose 110 pounds on Weight Watchers, right?  Yeah.  As soon as you got to your ideal weight, what did you start doing?  Actually, I just...  I basically just ate a little bit more than I was eating, just to maintain my weight.  Mm-hmm.  And, I mean, it worked. 
[01:27:30]  Believe it or not, I had a buddy that was doing it.  I weighed 366 at the time.  I was like a fucking baby gorilla.  And I just...  I didn't...  I ate whatever I wanted.  But you just take...  It's a point system.  And you just eat the particular amount of calories for a day, and your points.  And you eat whatever you want.  If I was going out at night to a hockey game or something like that, I'd eat a little during  the daytime.  I'd have my beers at night.  If I was going out for chicken wings, instead of eating 20, I would eat, you know, 8 or 10.  And I'd just watch my points, and I would lose 2, 3 pounds a week. 
[01:28:00]  The first week I did it, I lost, I think, 9 pounds.  The second week, I lost 7 pounds.  And after 10 months, I lost 110.  So, I mean, you can eat whatever you want.  The Atkins diet is shit.  Counting calories, this, that.  I'm telling you, Jimmy.  I'm going to do 1.5 pounds a day a week instead of 2 pounds.  Here's the thing.  He's recalculating now.  I know, I know.  It does seem 1100 seems a little low.  It's too low, Jimmy. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, honestly, I was down to about 1700, 1800 calories a day.  And at first, you want to rip your face off because you're starving.  But after a while, your stomach gets used to it, and it doesn't even bother you.  Here's the options for activity level.  Yeah.  How much cardio do you do?  Well, I do.  I work out, let's say, sometimes four times a week.  But let's say three times a week I do.  I do weights and cardio.  Sometimes I'm lazy, but I usually do three times a week.  So here's the options for your activity level. 
[01:29:00]  Sedentary, which I guess means you're just a fucking lump of shit.  Lightly active, moderately active, very active, and extremely active.  You're moderate.  See, I put extremely.  No, I'm kidding.  I put moderate, and then I'm like, am I cheating and lying to myself?  And then I put lightly.  But then I'm like, no, if I work out three, possibly four times a week,  I think that's in the middle.  Moderately active is okay.  So now instead of two pounds a week at lightly active, 
[01:29:30]  I put moderately active at 1.5 pounds a week,  and let's see where we wind up.  10,000 calories.  I'm way under.  It didn't come up.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  I'm sinking.  I want to see where I'm at,  because I'm already 297 calories over where I was supposed to be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you still got some shit there in front of you.  Well, I'm counting this.  Just fuck my face already.  I'm doing the best I can.  Give him a break, he's basically saying.  This studio is like a diner in the morning. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, I know.  It really is.  You want some blueberries?  Cool.  Are you allowed to have blueberries?  After recalculating, I've only eaten 84% of my daily allotted calories.  What the fuck, man?  This stinks.  Yeah, because you've got to sacrifice if you want to lose weight.  That's what it comes down to.  You've got to reprogram your brain.  Because the point I was getting with the guy in, I think it was Buffalo,  a lot of people go on diets, they get down to the weight they like,  and then they go, all right, don't need the diet anymore.  Done.  And they assume, like, magically, they're going to just stay at that weight. 
[01:30:30]  They didn't really learn much from dieting.  They were sacrificing until they got down to the weight.  Mm-hmm.  That's what happens.  That's why most people go right back to where they were.  You've got to learn.  Get the flu, lose a bunch of weight.  Dave in Canada.  Oh, Dave, that's not healthy.  Let's go to Jason in Minnesota.  Sorry to be so harsh.  Jason.  Good evening.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  I'm out.  I lost 140 pounds, Jimmy, just watching what I eat and working out. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I do work out.  I do watch what I eat, but there's certain things you don't realize.  I didn't realize oatmeal had that many calories.  It was just plain fucking oatmeal.  I didn't realize that.  You try to eat fat-free or calorie count.  I think you're confused.  The oatmeal doesn't have a lot of calories.  Oatmeal's only got 100 calories.  Yeah, it doesn't really have a lot of calories.  I know that, but...  Are you calculating wrong?  Yeah.  You're not supposed to have two cups, first of all.  Two cups is way too much.  Yes.  Because oatmeal in general doesn't have a lot of calories.  It's like eating sawdust.  Does sawdust have calories? 
[01:31:30]  I don't know.  Maybe if you put sugar on it.  I wouldn't eat it.  So maybe what I'll do is have my own oatmeal made here with a cup of hot water, and I'll make  the right amount.  What I do when I get the oatmeal from Kenny, I take half of it, and I throw it in the garbage  to begin with.  Well, I ate probably not.  Because they do...  You know, the portions in America, everyone knows it, they overfeed you to begin with.  I like good portions.  So think about a starving kid somewhere, and then lop off half your oatmeal and throw  in the goddamn garbage, and hope the starving kid finds the garbage later today. 
[01:32:00]  I was going to say, how does that help the poor starving kid?  Jason.  Hey there.  I lost 140 pounds watching what I eat and working out.  Yeah, we heard that.  No diet, though, right?  No, I just kind of watch what I eat.  I eat healthy.  All right.  We heard you watch it.  Okay.  I usually only eat bad, like, one day a week, and then eat good six days a week.  Hey.  I hope Breitbart is picking up this fine break.  Jimmy panicking and counting calories.  Someone's saying...  Ed in Boston, go ahead.  Who won last night? 
[01:32:30]  Red Sox or Yankees, Ed?  Red Sox kicked the shot.  Hey, what's up?  Seven zip?  Was that the score?  No, it wasn't seven zip.  What was it?  Was it?  Let me see.  Yes, it was seven zip.  No way.  Really?  Wait.  Yeah, seven zip.  A trouncing.  What do you got, Ed?  Hey, Jimmy.  You're going to laugh, but you're going to...  I'll get out of the way.  Go ahead.  You're going to try a colonic.  I've done colonics.  Oh, you have?  Yeah, the reason I don't do them anymore, stupid Todd Lynn, who actually got me into 
[01:33:00]  my colon health.  Yeah.  But I think they can be good to do once, but...  I've lost 25 pounds.  I've done two of them, and it did improve my digestion.  What do you eat, pebbles, and it just sits in your fucking colon?  No.  Well, I also took those pills that you swallow, the thing...  Oh, yeah.  They made me feel like crap.  I stopped taking those.  The cleansing crap.  Yes, but the colonic kind of moves your intestines out of shape a little bit.  It's stress...  Nothing really came out. 
[01:33:30]  It's just shit.  Oh, even Kenny took it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It seemed to help me a little bit, and then what else?  I eat like five, six times a day.  Are you doing that?  No, my eating has been a little bit bad lately.  Damn it.  Kids, I shit about your calories when this is a hot ass walking by the window, Jimmy.  Oh, and one other thing.  You have cravings, food cravings, like for sweets and all that?  I do.  I love sweets.  That's why they tell me you're such a sweet boy.  Try this stuff, Freelac. 
[01:34:00]  Freelac.  It's supposed to get rid of the food cravings.  What is it?  It's like a powder.  You take it once a day with water or twice a day.  It's like lemon flavored.  It's pretty good.  I think you can only buy it online.  Freelac, T-H-R-E-E-L-A-C.  Try that.  That could get rid of a lot of my...  I used to crave chocolate in the afternoon.  It's got a valley out of it.  You just fall asleep.  Right, right. 
[01:34:30]  But that seemed to do the job.  And then I jump rope a lot, too, at the beginning.  That seemed to help, too.  Ew.  Because I hate running.  Everyone knows what to do.  Yeah.  This is what it comes down to.  You know, I lost 25 pounds, and I've kept it off for like a year and a half.  You want to lose weight, so you said, you know what?  I'm going to do some jump roping.  Who the fuck wants to jump rope?  Yeah, I know, but I'd rather jump rope than run.  I hate running, so...  Anthony makes a great point. 
[01:35:00]  I tried jump roping in the gym recently.  Not recently.  A few years back.  I'm like, this is an activity for the young.  This isn't fun.  Baby toy you're playing with.  Was it ever fun?  I don't know.  But you only have to do it.  If you do it for 10 minutes, you get a lot out of it.  10 minutes?  I couldn't go two minutes, and I consider myself in pretty good shape.  But do like two minutes, take a minute break, then do another two minutes type of thing.  Get a jump rope.  I guarantee there's not a person in this room that could jump rope continually for two minutes. 
[01:35:30]  No.  And when you get tangled up, get right back into it.  And then hang yourself.  How good is jump rope for you?  Really good.  That's some good cardio.  I find every boxer ever does it, and I'm like, how good is it for you?  It's horrible.  Yeah, I know.  Look at their bodies.  They're phenomenal.  I would rather jump on my bike for 45 minutes than jump rope for like 10 minutes.  Yeah.  And I think it would be equal as far as the calories you lose.  Oh, so one more thing, Jimmy.  First thing you should have each morning is a glass of water. 
[01:36:00]  Yep.  Really?  Drink a glass of water first thing.  You feel like a million bucks.  Well, I do.  I take pills in the morning.  So I take...  No, no.  Forget the pills.  I can't forget them, sir.  Forget the pills.  Just have a glass of water.  Thanks.  Try that.  It gets rid of the belly flap.  This guy keeps it pretty simple.  All right.  Thank you, Ed.  Forget that cocktail you take in the morning.  Just listen to him talk.  You can't eat while you're sleeping.  See, because he was boring.  Oh, I didn't get it.  Oof.  I thought it was meant to be a joke, but it wasn't.  Yeah, it's supposed to be. 
[01:36:30]  On a humor diet.  As we talk about Jimmy's losing weight thing.  That was a one-calorie joke.  No calculations needed.  Corinne, it looks like, right?  Corinne?  Hey, guys.  First of all, my husband just asked me if I was calling into Oprah and friends based on the discussion.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, I hear you.  Okay.  So, anyway, Jimmy, you have to take into consideration other things other than just the calories, like fiber content. 
[01:37:00]  Oatmeal is so good for you.  The instant, though, sucks.  You need to be eating steel cut.  Opie, I think you used to eat that.  Actually, I didn't want to get too deep into the oatmeal discussion, but Corinne is absolutely right.  Steel cut.  Somehow.  Why do they call it that?  Well, somehow when they.  Circumcised.  When they process the oatmeal, they take all the goodness out of it, basically, as far as what it does for your body.  You keep it all rough, like the rough edges of the oatmeal, and that's just scraping the shit out of your body and getting everything out. 
[01:37:30]  She's right, actually.  And it keeps you full for a long time.  It's a pain in the ass, and I make my own oatmeal at home.  You've got to boil the water and fucking throw it in there for five minutes and keep stirring it.  You've got to barrel it.  Instead of, like, the instant where it takes, what, hot water on top of it, you're done?  Steel cut.  Okay.  The serving size I have is 100 grams of serving size.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Hold on.  We're going to.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There's calories.  Holy shit.  We've got some fucking ass walking around this place.  There are calories.  God damn it.  Are, um, holy mackerel. 
[01:38:00]  What?  Holy mackerel.  Those guys are handsome.  Wow.  Um.  Oh, my God.  Look at the stuff, the food details it gives you.  Who gives a shit about your stupid calories?  Opiate gives you serving size, calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, sugars.  Boner length.  Now.  Boner length.  I got a full.  I'm pushing a solid four thin.  Corinne, there you go. 
[01:38:30]  Anything else?  So the fiber is important, too, there, Jimmy.  Corinne doesn't play games.  Facts hang up.  Yeah.  Did you figure out your calories yet for today?  So far, I'm at, uh, I have 284 left.  For the day?  The oatmeal fucking erect.  That's if you're an extreme athlete now, though, right?  Yeah.  Yes, because I put, like, I act like a Michael Phelps when I'm on the iPhone.  According to this, I can eat 300 pancakes as long as I swim for nine hours and fun.  Dan in Utah.  Dan.  Hello, Dan.  We're trying to move on from this, but look at the phones. 
[01:39:00]  I know.  I don't know.  Good indication.  The phones are ringing this heavy.  Everybody struggles with this shit.  I know, but we all know what to do.  We just don't want to do it.  That's, that's, I want to write a book.  We all know what to do, but we just don't want to do it.  That's the name of my new book.  One fucking page.  And then, well, maybe a second page.  One page.  Just do it.  That would not be a big seller.  Dan, what's up?  Can you imagine if you went through all the trouble of publishing and promoting it and  it was one page and it was a ripoff of Nike's logo and they sued you?  Just do it.  Just do it.  You lost everything? 
[01:39:30]  All right, go ahead, Dan.  Dan.  You're up, Dan.  Utah.  Hey.  Hello, boys.  Welcome to Utah.  Thank you.  You know what, guys?  Everybody's got such a freaking great idea here and there.  It's all about the magic bullet.  Still cut oats are awesome, Jimmy, but like you found out, dude, you'll only be able to  eat two tablespoons full.  You know what, Opie?  You're absolutely right.  What you got to do is change your lifestyle, Jimmy.  You've got to figure out what works best for your body, keeping your blood sugar, your 
[01:40:00]  insulin levels all under control.  Dude, you'll rock it.  I don't eat.  I don't have to eat.  Go ahead.  Dude, I don't eat terribly.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay, man.  Except for the oatmeal, I really don't.  And I do exercise.  And I eat grilled chicken for lunch usually.  I don't eat fucking horribly.  It's just a few things that you're not aware of that you can't.  Like when I eat, if I order Chinese food, Chinese food can be very fattening.  So I order brown rice and it's like grilled chicken and vegetables and a little bit of 
[01:40:30]  sauce on the side that's not that fattening.  It's saucy.  And it's got MSG in it that'll help you retain water like nobody's business.  So yeah, the next day I see people go up five, six, seven pounds after a good P.F.  Chang meal.  Yeah.  Well, P.F.  Chang's.  Yeah, I'm not eating that.  Once you get like a gastric bypass, go down to 80 for a little bit of a little rash.  Give me the voice of reason must prevail.  Hey, I got to go to David Kennedy.  He's got this.  All right, man. 
[01:41:00]  Dave, go ahead.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  You know what?  Like I just burned 325 calories in 20 minutes on the elliptical here.  And the guy that was speaking earlier about the water is right on the money.  Like I have a glass of water every morning, do a workout for an hour every day.  And it's all about your own body style, your weight.  Like you don't have to be a certain size to be or a certain weight for this size.  And if you're eating to try to match a certain weight, you're going to be screwing yourself up.  You do what's comfortable for you. 
[01:41:30]  And you're going to burn, you know, by doing regular workouts, walking.  You know, elliptical is great because it's your pace, right?  I do the elliptical.  But, sir, you don't understand.  I want to be a twink.  You want to be a twink.  No, I'm not obsessed.  I just want to track what I'm doing because I don't.  When did this break start?  But he's not obsessed.  What are you writing down now, Jimmy?  Oh, good luck with it, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  I meant to watch.  I wanted to watch that video we played yesterday with Burn in Hell because I heard it on the replay. 
[01:42:00]  But I just wanted to write down to ask Danny which one it was.  You want to play it again after the break?  I think that video should get a lot more attention than it's getting.  It kind of fucking rules.  It really is.  So, no, I'm not upset.  Tom Papa, my buddy, he's a comic.  I saw him last night and he was telling me he does this.  The calorie counting thing?  Yeah, but he showed me the app and I went out and bought it for $3 and why not?  Like, I wanted to have a slice of pizza the other day.  I very, very rarely eat pizza.  But I'm like, how many calories?  Like, I just don't know. 
[01:42:30]  You don't want to know.  I do.  Why don't you put it in your calorie counter?  You know what?  You don't want to know.  I'm going to ask the old iPhone.  You don't want to know.  So, that pizza is dangerous.  Dangerous shit.  Let's check out pizza.  But boy, does it taste fucking good.  Yeah, yeah.  It's wonderful.  Avoid soy, Jimmy.  It gives you man tits.  That's Mike and Westchester.  I've heard that.  I should be going to skim milk.  You're right.  No way Jimmy is eating two cups of oatmeal.  It just goes on and on.  One more call and then we got to move on.  Oh, you know what?  Wait.  Wait. 
[01:43:00]  Are the cups, does it count after there's fluid in it or before?  A quarter cup of oatmeal.  Wait a minute.  Still with a quarter cup of oatmeal.  If you have a, if I had 16 ounces of oatmeal, but that's with the fucking liquid in it.  That's not 16 ounces of dry oatmeal plus liquid.  No.  What?  Yeah, but if it's, if it's water liquid, who cares?  It's skim milk.  Yeah, if it's heavy cream, then you might have a problem. 
[01:43:30]  That's true.  Oh boy.  We didn't learn anything.  Wow.  We really try to teach.  Not a goddamn thing.  Pizza, New York style, two slices, 723 calories.  I bet you it's even higher.  Oh shit.  Bill, Long Island.  Good evening.  I would put pizza way higher than 700.  Are you sure?  Pizza, that's for two slices.  Two slices, 700?  New York style pizza.  So you can have that for lunch almost and stay right around that 2,000 calorie thing. 
[01:44:00]  Bill, what do you got?  Hey guys, this calorie counting, the episode of Intervention Monday night had a set of twins  on there that counted their calories, weighed their food, and fought about who was getting  ounces more.  You got to check out some clips of it on the YouTube there.  It's crazy, these chicks.  Nothing but bones.  It's crazy.  And it's Intervention, because I hear there's another great show about OCD that started  this past week.  Yeah, right after Intervention, it's called Obsessed, and I definitely thought about you 
[01:44:30]  Opie when I was watching it.  No shit.  You got to get that out.  It was crazy.  You and about 1,000 people.  Hey, I got a show that's perfect for you.  I got to take a look at Obsessed.  Pizza, one slice, 260 calories.  That doesn't seem right.  I know it doesn't, but is that right though?  It might be more carbs.  I'm not smarter than the iPhone thing.  Wait, how is it saying sodium, zero, fat, 10 grams?  No, this is wrong.  What the fuck?  How is it saying there's no sodium or carbs in pizza? 
[01:45:00]  In pizza?  What is it, you eat the box?  Just put sauce in the box and eat that box.  On the cardboard.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy, this is a lot of fun.  This looks more realistic.  Can we take a break now, Jimmy?  Sodium?  Oh, boy.  Here's the two slices, right?  Yeah.  New York pizza, 723 calories, 36.6 grams of fat.  That's for two.  Serving size is two slices.  Sodium, 1,716 milligrams. 
[01:45:30]  Holy shit, that's a lot of salt.  Is it?  Yeah.  Because that's what I've been trying to eat.  I go to bed at 11 o'clock at night, every night, I have three slices of pizza.  But I have a Diet Coke with it.  You're not overweight.  You're just bloated from all that salt.  Yeah, he's the water weight.  Right.  Dude, I was laying on my side the other day, and I was just looking at my stomach hang.  Like, I just wanted to fucking...  I was too tired to get out of bed and commit suicide.  But if I was more awake, I would have.  Isn't that the worst feeling, though? 
[01:46:00]  Yes.  How do you know?  You're in good shape, dude.  No, dude.  I'm not...  You are.  I mean, I'd have to lay behind you and wrap my arms around you just to feel your guts.  Just to feel your...  You have to spoon him?  Yeah.  You're cuddle weight.  I've got my own problems.  A little gut action.  Do you?  Yeah.  No one's happy with their stupid body.  I want to rub guts.  Ugh.  Rub guts.  I want to do the joke.  A couple of buddies rubbing guts.  Guts together.  Why don't we take a break? 
[01:46:30]  I get a tingle.  Grandmother taste.  What do you say, Ann?  I want to hear it.  Oh!  What?  You think people are still listening?  Because I want a big audience for this next piece of production.  Of course.  Yeah, the phones are lit.  People didn't go anywhere.  Of course they are.  They all care about their bodies.  Yes.  Thank you for staying with the Opie and Anthony show.  We appreciate it.  Andy Rooney?  Uh-huh.  Remember Jim Norton's Andy Rooney?  Sure.  You ever notice when you're calorie counting, you always eat more calories than you think?  Do what I do.  Drink morally safer's cum. 
[01:47:00]  I doubt he's doing that.  He certainly is.  Pizza...  You ever want to lose weight?  Just do what Ed Bradley did.  Oh, that's right.  He's dead.  Yes.  But he looks terrific.  He certainly does.  He's lost a lot of weight.  And don't hold all the watches they give you.  Watch.  But he's in need of a haircut by now.  You ever notice when your fingernails are growing and you're on a satin pillow that you lose 
[01:47:30]  a lot of weight, but you smell bad?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  All right.  Jimmy, that iPhone app is shit.  This is Kevin W. in Jersey.  It's Pete Blackberry.  I'll leave you with this.  He says, check out thedailyplate.com.  And he says New York style pizza is about 400 calories.  So that's right around what your app is saying.  Yeah, it's close.  All right.  Anyway, Jimmy did the Andy Rooney thing. 
[01:48:00]  We go to break with this.  Very funny.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney.  Regrettably, Mr. Rooney has fallen ill and is partly performed by renowned thespian James  Norton.  Without further ado, Andy Rooney.  I'm Andy Rooney.  I like watches.  I talk a lot about watches.  When the big hands are on the 12, I've just shit my pants. 
[01:48:30]  And when the big hands are on the floor, I've just pissed on myself and grabbed my wife's  breasts.  Do you ever notice when someone turns around in bed like Oscar Madison?  You put your penis in the wrong hole.  Do you ever notice that?  Do you ever notice?  You've never seen me walking.  My asshole has actually been stuck to this seat since 1973.  Do you ever notice that?  This concludes tonight's performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney starring James  Norton. 
[01:49:00]  Fuck that.  I'm beating everyone to the punch.  If you want to see boobies, OB Radio on Twitter.  Oh.  Oh.  Because we all took our pictures.  Yes.  We'll explain in a minute.  You didn't get a picture yet of Kate?  No.  Good God.  We were supposed to play the Ricky video, but we've got to talk about Kate.  Kate is Roland's friend.  Used to work with Roland.  And she does some music.  And, uh... 
[01:49:30]  I see.  A little too over-exposed.  It's too over-fucking-exposed.  Kate, I told you that would happen.  Wow.  Mother.  Too much light on her.  Too much light, right, Ann?  You got to do...  And the back, the black background.  Man.  Contrast.  That Aryan race.  Kate is blonde, blue eyes.  She's not wearing a bra.  She's got, like, the most ridiculous top on ever.  It's chilly in here.  You guys did that.  Can I photograph you with that top on?  Let me take...  Let me do it with the flash and without a flash. 
[01:50:00]  She's got cleavage going all the way down to her belly button.  It's very sheer.  It's see-through.  It's white.  Okay.  And I sing, too, right?  I'm doing it with the...  Oh, yeah.  Who needs the face, right?  Fuck that.  God damn it.  That's a good...  I apologize, Kate.  Let me take your picture.  Jimmy, we all wanted to.  We put the face in.  I mean, you can always Photoshop it out later, Jim.  No, you're right.  I gotta get a picture.  Your face is good.  That was really shitty of it.  Nothing.  I'm just a complete creep. 
[01:50:30]  See, look.  Look at the...  Oh, yeah.  Does it look better without the flash?  Oh, that's...  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  My flash is working fine.  You know what?  I'll Twitter it.  I'm kidding.  I won't.  Fuck that.  I'm going up here.  Oh, we're getting the angles.  Look at this.  Oh, he's standing on his chair.  I know.  This is trouble.  So, I guess you're...  He's walking on the console.  Good things men do for some areola.  Which, by the way, the console is, like, not going to support your weight.  Why?  I don't know.  On the corner like that.  I see it bending. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, really?  See, Kate...  Well, you got your, like, hiking shoes on and everything, man.  You're ready for this.  Kate's smart, though, because she came in here looking really sexy, and she wants us  to promote whatever the fuck she wants to promote.  Katecoopermusic.com.  Consider it promoted.  Yeah.  What is your...  What do you...  What kind of music do you sing?  I sing soul music.  Soul blues music.  Really?  Don't pose yet.  I got to.  Come on.  I'm posing.  I do it naturally.  We've had naked girls in here that we didn't photograph so much.  That's crazy. 
[01:51:30]  Hold on.  Hey, Marge, what needs to be fixed?  I noticed that you're in here.  Look, you're standing over there.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  What are you fixing?  You know what?  Whoever said turn off the flash is like the king.  Can we turn off that overhead light, too?  I'm like a vampire.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Not all the lights.  No.  Turn that light off.  Oh, my God.  You rock.  Eric, what are you doing?  Just stand in front of a light.  Block it.  This is perfect.  Sorry.  I lose the headphones.  That's right. 
[01:52:00]  Could you do a handstand and a dress?  I pulled the top, like...  What am I going for?  Am I, like, a cheetah right now?  Well, basically, you're going for topless.  I'm holding a secret.  The tape...  She has tape on.  I have double-sided tape on.  Yeah.  So you can pull them to the side a little more.  The guys will appreciate that.  They will.  All right.  Let me see her.  Let me see her.  Yeah, there you go.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  Just whore me out.  And, uh...  And...  Arch your back slightly.  What?  And am I right?  Of course you are. 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  No.  Wow.  One, two, three.  Oh, yeah.  That was the one?  The money shot.  You have, uh...  What I think is very sexy is darker areolas, which I think are...  Well, thank you very much.  They're better than lighter.  That would look silly.  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of...  They were lighter than your skin?  Yeah.  There are some that are very light.  There's some that kind of just blend out, and you don't even notice when they end.  Those are kind of weird, right?  Yeah.  Very odd.  Not down for that.  I don't like the theaters.  I don't like the theaters.  I like knowing where they start and begin.  Exactly. 
[01:53:00]  A well-defined areola.  Yes.  So you sing, uh...  I don't ask for much.  Blues.  I sing blues, yep.  Okay.  We should play a song.  Yes.  Yeah.  Try again.  That's usually the favorite.  I hope we like it.  Try again?  Yeah.  And what's the website?  Kate?  Katecoopermusic.com.  Oh, you just got a lot of hits.  See, she's smart.  She knows how to work.  Yes.  Oh, hell yeah.  Kate is a very sexy...  Actually, I should be taking a Twitter picture, too.  Yeah, send that one to me, Iraq, immediately. 
[01:53:30]  Immediately.  You know, fuck the BlackBerry and its stupid camera when you got a real digital...  I won't even take a picture with your breast.  Like, I won't.  What do you mean?  I'm lying.  Yeah.  I actually got a picture of your face, too.  Sam, I need that videotape.  Yes.  Right.  Yes.  We're going to make her...  I'm going to make...  Don't you want to know what you're going to do?  Don't you want, Jimmy?  All right.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  What's the name of the song?  Try again?  Yeah, track one.  What if this song sucks?  I don't know.  Oh, you got a CD?  I need another job.  How many CDs did you bring?  I brought a bunch.  Do you want one?  I certainly do.  She's a smart marketer.  That is.  You bring a bunch.  She brings great breasts and gifts.  She fucking rules.  And we brought bagels.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I shouldn't have one.  I'm calorie counting.  Oh, you are counting.  Oh, I know.  That was terrible.  Thank you, Kate.  I was eating it the entire time you guys were talking about the damn calorie shit.  And I was like... 
[01:54:30]  She could be the perfect guest.  Can I say that right now, actually?  She could be the perfect guest.  No bra, cleavage, see the nipples nicely.  She brings CDs and bagels.  What do you bring?  And she loves Roland.  What else will we love?  Absolutely.  Here's Try Again from Kate Cooper.  Turn off for a second.  Stop.  I don't like it.  Get him out of here.  I'm kidding.  Play it.  I know that's the wrong track.  Go back.  What track is it?  Number one.  All right.  Number one.  Number one.  Kate Cooper.  Got it. 
[01:55:00]  Try again.  No.  Number one.  Oh.  Number one.  Gregorio.  All right.  Number one.  See, it says number one.  Don't.  What?  What?  No.  What?  Number one.  That's an enormous country.  This isn't it either.  Shit.  Who knows how to count?  It's easy.  When a number one is on the scene.  Maybe if you open it up and close it again.  Number one.  You can start it again.  Try again?  Try again.  Kate Cooper.  I'm sitting down here since yesterday morning. 
[01:55:30]  I can't seem to drink you away.  I know it's late and I shouldn't get going.  But just please let me explain. 
[01:56:00]  You didn't care and he was there.  Baby, that night you left me alone.  He pulled up a chair with his green-eyed stare.  And I took him home.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  I took him home.  That man there, he could take your place.  Tied on the room and he gave me juice.  But when he slipped inside.  Yeah.  When he slipped inside.  I saw your face.  Oh. 
[01:57:00]  I saw your face.  What do I do if I can't move on?  What do I do if you are the one?  What would you say if I asked us to try?  Try again a little harder this time.  What do you think so far? 
[01:57:30]  I like it a lot.  Yes.  Are you doing like a Milli Vanilli thing?  No, no.  That's me.  You're just the face of Kate Cooper but someone else is singing.  Yeah, there's just like 300-pound woman from Louisiana.  That's really shit and everything.  I know.  No, it's really good.  Cool.  I'm glad you like it.  Good stuff. 
[01:58:00]  You're talking about fucking there.  Oh, yeah.  Slipping it in.  Yeah.  You know?  It's the classic song, man.  You know?  It's like, God, you're pissed off.  He's not there.  You're drunk.  You're like, well, fuck it.  Fuck him.  Damn.  And then like, you're right about to be there.  And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, conscience.  Like Jiminy Cricket jumps in, you know?  It's like, what the fuck?  He fucked you too?  Yeah.  He gave a little whistle.  And when the boo comes in.  Oh, she's fucking Tigger.  That's not as bad as who she could be, fucking. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, right?  No, it's various topics.  Like, there's another Trek star, which is basically about a, it's kind of a faster one, but that's  basically about a girl trying to be an actress who winds up becoming a porn star and fucking  annoying.  Oh, nice.  I like that.  Yeah.  It's a nice little story about, you know, because porn stars are people too.  Oh, exactly.  Dreams, you know?  Feel good.  American dream kind of a story.  We should play Let's Make a Deal for the second half of the song here. 
[01:59:00]  You want to play Let's Make a Deal, Kate Cooper?  Uh-oh.  What's the deal?  Well, we got the second half of the song to play for everybody.  Or another song.  Well, I think she wants to get the single out of it.  Oh, you want to play the whole song?  Yeah, this is single.  Okay, so let's play Let's Make a Deal.  Jimmy?  Yes, I am.  Anthony?  I'm for it.  Oh, why wouldn't I?  I don't even know what I'm signing up for.  What is this?  It's nothing.  You give us a little something something, we give you the second half of the song.  Oh, okay.  What's the something something?  I don't know.  That's what we got to figure out.  That's part of the deal.  That's part of the deal. 
[01:59:30]  That's tough.  Jimmy?  I'm all for it.  Well, you got an idea?  If you sleep with me.  Hold on, let me finish.  I will put this on my iPod and sing along with it while I'm on the bus and the train.  By the way.  Only if you cuddle after.  By the way, Wilmington Wow from Wack Bag, he goes, if you type Kate Cooper in Google,  you might want to change your name. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, no.  Well, no.  There's some other girl from Australia, but she looks like...  She's not just some other girl.  That's the best part about this.  I know, there's three other Kate Coopers actually out there, which is literally like my name.  There's like an amputee, a bodybuilder, and then Tits McGee.  Wilmington.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's Kate Cooper.  That's hilarious.  Kate Cooper's pianist.  Yeah.  She has no hands. 
[02:00:30]  She is a triple amputee.  Yeah, she is.  But you know what?  Eventually, I will get to the point where I just wipe out all the other Kate Coopers and  Google search.  Well, I'm sure that one will starve to death.  Yeah.  She'll die just looking at a knife and fork.  Now, who's the other one?  She would have loved your calorie counting.  Oh, she would have.  She's trying to punch in the iPhone or stumps.  Getting nowhere.  Yeah, of course not.  Calorie counting.  She just keeps restarting.  So, what's the bodybuilder? 
[02:01:00]  Let me see the bodybuilder.  She made a big clip.  That looks photoshopped.  Yes, it does.  Yeah.  Oh, that's horrible.  That looks scary.  Yeah.  That's better.  I don't think I'm going to be confused with her.  No.  I'm not too concerned about that.  Your tape.  Oopsie.  Yes, your clear tape is showing.  Oopsie.  She's not meant to wear tape.  No.  She wears it because she has to.  I do.  Why don't you just take the tape off?  That's because I want her.  She's so inhibited.  This part of this, are we making a deal now?  If those are completely natural.  Gee whiz.  No.  That means no.  They still look great.  Those are implants? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  They do very nicely.  They look good.  What?  I know, right?  It's all about the teardrop shape.  They sit very nicely, yes.  Yes, yes.  I did my research.  You can only tell because they're so perfect.  There's no revealing things that show that they're implants.  It's just like those look fucking amazing.  Isn't it true that most girls want to show off implants?  No.  Oh.  See how I shot that down?  No, sorry.  I couldn't resist it.  Fuck me running.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  The way you asked that was so Dr. Phil-ish.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  You know, I read a statistic once.  You can't ask it like a pervert.  No, no, no.  You got to ask it Dr. Phil-ish to get anything done.  So let's get to the bottom of it.  You seem like you're pretty open.  Are you a sexually open gal?  Yes.  I'm a Scorpico.  Scorpio, yeah.  I don't know if that means anything to you guys.  Well, would you say you're more dominant or submissive?  For real.  You know, I would say I'm more dominant when it comes to picking scenarios.  I'm a big fan of going out to theme hotels or doing kind of costumes and all that stuff. 
[02:02:30]  What kind of role play?  What kind of costumes?  All various kinds.  I like getting him to be like really kind of scumbaggy and I like have to meet him at a hotel like I'm a hooker.  Really, you piece of shit?  Yeah.  But, you know, but then every once in a while.  Hold on, she said scumbaggy, not Eric Roberts from Star 80.  I like the hooker scenario.  That's fucking hard. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  But, you know, every once in a while, I am a girl.  Every once in a while, I do like that, you know, it's a little just tender and letting him kind of take control and, you know, kind of surprise me, you know?  Yeah.  You know, wake you up at three in the morning with, you know, smacking your face with his penis.  Let's go.  I don't want to wake someone up one day because I don't want a morning breath on my dick.  But I do.  I don't think that was ever your concern.  Yeah.  It's amazing how that's the first thing I think of, though.  It's an alarm cock.  I know. 
[02:03:30]  I need one of those buttons.  I would, to complete my radio experience, I feel like you guys need to like either flush me down the toilet with one of those buttons or like back up a truck on me.  All right.  Do something.  Yes!  It's official.  Are you always this happy or?  Yeah.  What is it?  It's kind of disgusting.  I don't know.  I actually ran into you and Roland on the street, what, two days ago?  Yeah.  And you were the same, like bubbly Coke.  What is it?  Come on.  Let's get into this a little bit.  Yeah.  You're drinking a fucking drink. 
[02:04:00]  I know.  I'm a drinker.  But no, not this early.  I was like, wow, this girl has a lot of energy.  What are you doing with Roland?  We used to work together and I just think he's hilarious.  He's a great guy.  Well, he is.  He's a total solid.  We love Roland.  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  He's, he's, yeah.  Why wouldn't you, like, did you ever, you ever, we, we didn't know if you were dating  Roland at one point.  Did you ever date Roland?  No.  No.  Why not?  I was actually dating a guy for a long time.  We broke up like six months ago.  Cool.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, a little long-term thing.  Good for a long time.  No, it was good.  It was kind of one of those, I was like, eh. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Now it's just about, you know, getting out there.  Exactly.  It's a little, it's a little me time.  Yeah.  Yeah, for sure.  So were you singing back then, too?  Mm-hmm.  I've been singing since I was 16.  I moved to New York when I was 16.  From where?  From Washington, D.C.  Oh, okay.  So you're familiar with the, I was hoping it was some really small town somewhere.  Oh, no, no, no.  Fuck.  I hate when they're familiar with the big cities.  I know.  I want it to be like Coco in Fame.  Get off that bus, thinking you're going to be a big star in New York City.  Oh, why not?  Yeah.  And some pimp comes and grabs you.  Can I ask, how does the hooker scenario work in the role play? 
[02:05:00]  Generally, we pick out the hotel that we want, and we're not allowed to show each other our  costumes.  And we pick out kind of knowing what role we're going to be.  He kind of chooses what kind of guy he's going to be that evening.  Pitch up in a suit of armor.  Yeah.  Yes, he's silly.  And a sword.  Let's joust.  This isn't, see.  What are you doing?  What was I thinking?  Or she shows up with a porcupine.  Let's pretend we're porcupine owners. 
[02:05:30]  What?  What the fuck is that?  I couldn't think of anything.  I banicked.  Yeah.  I banicked under pressure.  We crashed your website, Kate.  Okay.  She's very sexy.  Want to go back to the song?  Yes.  She gave us some more stuff.  And then I would like to hear the rest of the hooker scenario.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear the rest of the hooker scenario.  She seems like she'd probably commit to it and be sexy, wouldn't she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, generally they show up as whatever John or whatever they are.  And I prefer, you know, I mean, down to like, we'll do different facial hair. 
[02:06:00]  So you don't even recognize the guy that it is.  It's a total stranger at the door.  And I'm the same way.  I'll show up and I'll, I have all sorts of wigs that I have in my repertoire, if you will.  And, you know, you just kind of choose what lady you're going to be that evening.  And he kind of comes to that door having no idea who you are or who, it's kind of,  it's basically like your two strangers meeting at a designated hotel on a given night.  So how do you, how would you, oh, sorry.  No, no, go ahead.  We just, prior to, we select what hotel and what time. 
[02:06:30]  So we have all that set up.  I can't get into that fantasy world.  I would just laugh going, look, you've got to be laughing.  Well, no, no, no.  Some of it's fine.  But then it's like, well, no, well, see, and then you should.  Look at you as a redhead.  All right.  I'm with her.  No, I know.  And there's a lot of people.  I wish I could get more involved in that fantasy world.  It's like a back and forth because half the time you two are giggling hysterically together.  And then the other half the time, you'll like, oh, well, I'm not saying during the sex.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But like beforehand, you see each other. 
[02:07:00]  And then at the same time, it's like, then every once in a while you'll catch him and  you're like, it's kind of like a scummy stranger and you're really able to give into the fantasy.  And it's fun.  I mean, also, I mean, of course, I like straight up sex too.  Do you wear a miniskirt?  Like a little dirty miniskirt?  Yeah, I do that.  Or I do, I'm a big fan of this like gold latex stuff, like American Apparel stuff, you know?  And like the best part is like shopping prior to, because it's you and all the strippers  on 42nd Street picking out hooker heels, you know, like, oh, damn, girl, that looks good  for your ass.  And you're just like, okay, thanks. 
[02:07:30]  Danish girls?  Yeah, yes, yes.  Nice, strong Danish girls.  Sometimes a little fantasy is fucking good.  Do you know what I used to do with one girl?  Well, and this is, most girls wouldn't do this, but I used to make her, she would look  at pornographic pictures online and she would tell me which guy she wanted to fuck and I  would choke her and, uh, and slap her for wanting to fuck other guys.  She loved it.  She loved it.  I'm not saying she didn't.  I'm looking at you. 
[02:08:00]  But I, I, I loved it too because it was so dirty because like women don't admit that  a lot of times that dirty side that they like a big cock or they like something nasty.  They go, oh, no, I don't.  And it's like annoying, that prudish shit.  So when you see, when you're fucking a girl and she's looking at a guy's dick on a fucking  computer screen or she's watching two people fuck and you know she's thinking of fuck,  it's just, it's like, I love that dirtiness brought out.  There's some type of cuckold thing going on.  But it's, yes and no.  It's like an almost opposite cuckold.  You, you, you, you're doing the fucking and you just want to be angry. 
[02:08:30]  Not angry, no.  At some girl looking at another cock.  Like just, it's not even that I want to be angry about it.  She wants it more than yours.  It just turns me on that she's that dirty.  But I don't really feel necessarily submissive to her.  I just want to punish her and spank her.  And a woman likes that because she's being like, you know, she likes being disciplined or punished.  You understand what I'm saying?  It kind of serves all needs.  Oh, I understand what you're saying, yeah.  Well, how does something like that start?  I eventually killed her.  How does it start?  Well, I mean, like, is it like you change lanes without signaling? 
[02:09:00]  Like, same thing, you're just having sex and suddenly you just slap her and you're like,  did she like that?  No, no, you know she likes it.  You have like a discussion prior to.  Like we're talking right now about sex.  You talk about it casually.  You get to know each other.  You don't do it in bed.  What should I do now?  You talk about it beforehand.  That's why your hooker scenario is sexy.  Well, because I've been in a scenario where I was with a guy for a while.  And he literally just, you know, one time we were at it and he kind of like gave me  this like slap.  Like, you know, he wanted to try it, but that was like not the way to bring it about.  When you're right there in the middle of it, something like slaps me across the face 
[02:09:30]  and was kind of like, yeah, no, we're not going to be doing that.  Jesus.  And then it was kind of like, he was like, oh, okay.  You got to negotiate that.  All right, about that.  You got to negotiate that stuff.  We got to talk about this later.  Let's make a deal.  Pull that slap out.  I know.  Yeah, you got to negotiate that ahead of time.  You better put that in your pocket again.  Here's how you start with a slap.  Here's how you find out.  Yeah, how do you start with it?  So let us know.  How do you start with a slap?  You do spanking first.  Because spanking is innocent.  And if she likes to be spanked, then you, when you're kissing, and this is not all the same  encounter usually, unless she's told you she wants to be slapped. 
[02:10:00]  And then as you're like, sometimes you can just put your hand gently over the neck, and  as you're kissing, you squeeze very lightly.  And if she doesn't like it, you haven't squeezed hard enough to make her uncomfortable.  But if your hand is just on her neck, and she's like, if she makes any kind of an indication  that she likes it, you know, she likes a little pressure on the neck.  And she's going, yeah.  If she turns into Luca Brasi, you've made a mistake.  Then you throw her vagina in a vest, and you give it to fucking Sonny.  Thank you, man.  Or, with the face slapping, and this, very few women actually like this. 
[02:10:30]  I haven't met a good face slapper in a long time, to be real honest with you.  As you're kissing, you can kind of grab the face, like if it gets that kind of intense.  Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, that style, on the outtakes at the end of Animal Run.  Yeah, when you're grabbing the face lightly, it's almost like a slap, but very light.  And you can just kind of tell by her body language if that was something you could push a little  further, or if she wouldn't want you to.  It's a very light way of kind of testing the waters.  Would you let Jimmy slap you for the second half of the song? 
[02:11:00]  I don't know how to slap her.  Well, you're not going to like, haul off.  You're going to do it nice.  She leaves like the hooker did in American Psycho.  She's fucking running out of the place.  I don't need Roland fucking running through the door like Fred Gwynn.  Oh, we know Roland.  We know Roland has that side of him.  Oh, yeah.  You know, you're right.  Hey, dude, Ozzy sucks.  And then he starts beating me against the fucking floor like the kid in Caligula.  You ever see Roland's angry side?  No.  You've never seen it?  I've never seen it.  It's amazing. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my goodness.  He can be so nasty.  Oh, really?  It's amazing.  Can he be nasty?  Boy, do we appreciate Roland's bad side.  And he's such a sweet boy.  Oh, I kind of want to see that.  I know.  Not directly at me.  I mean, not.  Unfortunately, a certain employee isn't here anymore that he used to love getting evil on.  You got a quick clip of Roland losing his shit for Kate?  Travis, if you can find one.  Well, I have the famous one that answered that.  I can't hear a word you're saying, Travis.  You can't?  I can't hear it.  Oh, you got it.  Yeah.  I can't hear him, but Danny just wrote he has it. 
[02:12:00]  This is some, I think Master Poe, who was a security guy over at XM, we had him for  a long time.  And I think him and Roland, he was tackling Roland as a joke, but he put him down too hard.  Like, he hurt Roland.  He wasn't supposed to.  Yeah.  So, I think Roland got very upset.  Roland has two emotions.  He wants to touch him the same way as brother did.  Wow.  Is it still dead?  What the fuck?  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Oh, my God.  This guy should be in a movie. 
[02:12:30]  My condolences.  He goes, has your dog still dead?  And then Roland goes, here, boy.  Master Poe loves his dog, too.  Loves his dog.  Oh, man.  Roland knows exactly where to twist the knife.  And the dog was still dead, by the way.  Yes.  Yes.  Because you were wondering.  I was concerned.  Keep it factual.  Art from Arizona wants to know if you have a hairy snatch.  Because we learned on the show, when you break up with a long-term relationship, you  let everything grow in for a while.  Actually, let me tell you.  And Ant loves hairy snatches these days.  No, I didn't say that.  I said, I want to see one because it's so, no, it's so rare these days. 
[02:13:00]  For good reason.  Like, like, it's just so rare because everyone's shaved down.  Why don't I get a reaction for that?  Because I'm trying to hear, only because I'm thinking about whether or not she's shaved.  I didn't even know you started a little loud noise.  Like, I'm going to hold my sneezing.  Well, actually, I'm doing the LASIK hair removal.  So I'm basically hairless, except for I do have, I do have hair.  It's like, I call it my Hitler mustache. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's a little bit.  But yeah, but besides that, you know, I definitely buy, yeah, so I don't have to ever shave basically  from like, like, it's just a laser.  They're lasering your arms?  It's fantastic.  You go six times, not my arms.  I'm keeping the arms because I think that's kind of a little freaky, but underarms and then  the legs.  Well, exactly.  That's why I'm not doing my arms.  Does it hurt when they laser it or no?  No, not at all.  You just lay there and read a magazine and they'd laser your hair and it kills the follicles  and then you're hairless and you never have to shave again.  But it's got to be dog hair.  So then you're never like dealing with stubbly and all that.  Are you getting your vag done too? 
[02:14:00]  Oh, yeah, everything.  Yeah, totally Brazilian, everything.  What nationality are you?  I'm Aryan.  I'm German.  German?  Yeah.  So you have dark or light pubic hair?  Dark.  Okay, because laser doesn't work as well with light.  Yeah.  It's got to be dark roots and laser.  Yeah.  You have to shave first, right?  You have to shave first, then you go in.  Yep.  And so, yeah, so it's all trimmed because it doesn't even grow in anywhere.  See, no one going with the bush anymore.  Welcome to the future.  She can sing.  She hates bras.  And she's getting all the hair removed from her vagina.  Yeah, she's what we call the fucking, the triple crown winner. 
[02:14:30]  A good egg.  Why don't we play the rest of Try Again from Kate Cooper?  Okay.  And then we'll, I don't know, take a break and we'll figure out what else we can do with  Kate.  And we got other stuff to do today too as well.  It's all about Kate.  But Kate Cooper.  Nothing more important than Kate today.  Here's the second half.  I know we said we'd take a little break now.  Just give us time to breathe. 
[02:15:00]  But every time I go out, it makes me realize you're all that I need.  They say you've got to get your love, baby, while you can.  But I still realize it's not the same from any other man. 
[02:15:30]  You know, I want it from any other man.  What do I do if I care who won?  What do I do if you are the one?  What would you say if I asked us to try? 
[02:16:00]  Try to get a little harder this time.  You are the only one for me.  You are the only one for me.  Try again, I want to try again.  You are the only one for me. 
[02:16:30]  Very sultry. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I like it a lot.  Kate Cooper.  Sex music.  Yeah.  If you want more, Kate.  Sex.  Coopermusic.com.  Yeah.  Sexy.  Sultry.  Yeah, it's got a nice vibe to it.  Really good.  Let it fade out.  What?  I know.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll be back.  Yes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  We're going to bring Kate Cooper and Roland back in studio in a little bit. 
[02:17:30]  They've been friends forever.  We want to know what that's all about.  Yes, we want to get to the bottom of that.  Absolutely.  And Anthony, look who's on the phone.  Yes, my pal.  Adam Farrar.  Oh.  Hey, what's up, pal?  What's up, Adam?  Hi.  Just Patrikki.  Patrikki.  Hold on.  Patrikki just poked his head in.  What are you doing here?  Where are you going?  On the black radio.  Of course.  We can't get the black guy. 
[02:18:00]  I'm in Friday.  Oh, goody.  That's okay.  How you been?  Good?  I like the new...  You're looking casual.  Yeah, I like it.  You're more cash.  Than we're used to seeing there, Patrice.  You're very colorful.  It's a yellow and green kind of...  Tablecloth.  Checkered shirt.  I'm not a fucking fly-by-night kind of guy.  Oh, shit.  That's very decent of you.  You know what I mean?  Just say hi.  That is.  Patrice is dressed like a tall child.  He just gave you the...  He's smelling shit look.  Bye, Patrice. 
[02:18:30]  This was a little more uneventful than I thought it would be just dropping and saying hi.  Exactly.  He's just like, what's this nigga want?  Well, it's weird that you come in without hanging.  Yeah.  I am just saying hi.  Why don't you just come in?  And it was bad timing because we got Adam Ferrara on the phone.  And he's sitting there wondering what the fuck is going on.  What is he pitching?  He's pitching a bunch of things.  Hey, it's the Bono guy that was on our show.  Oh, is that Bono?  The child clothing line.  Yeah.  Hey, Adam.  How are you, buddy?  How are you, pal?  All right.  There he is.  I guess you're calling about Funny as Hell, Friday, June 12th, Comedy Central, 11 p.m. 
[02:19:00]  Yes, I am.  Oh!  And the DVD will be available on Amazon.com if it's not available already.  It's already available now, and I'm just calling you guys because I miss you.  How is everybody?  What is Funny as Hell?  Why did you call it that?  Because I was going through just a really shitty time, and I'm like, man, I'm either going  to write a special about this, or I'm climbing a water tower with a high-powered rifle.  What was it, a breakup?  Yeah, it was the breakup.  Okay.  My father got cancer. 
[02:19:30]  My grandmother died, you know.  Jesus.  Oh.  So, funny as hell.  All that stuff makes great comedy.  Yeah.  Well, after a while, it starts off as bitter and angry bullshit, and then it gets funny.  Do you talk about the action stuff in the act?  Yeah.  Mostly how I screwed it up.  You know, she was just, you know, it was that point, you know, when you look in the mirror  and you go, all right, denial and blame isn't working, it's all your fault.  Right.  So, that was pretty much it.  So, but we turned it into joy.  Take your pain and turn it into joy.  But, Adam, were you angry or were you more relieved? 
[02:20:00]  Like, sometimes if I end a relationship or a relationship ends, I'm mad, but a part of  me is relieved because I didn't want to take it to the next level.  No, I was more angry.  I was more angry that it, but it was, I was angry it didn't work out.  I was angry at myself because I was making the same mistakes.  And, you know, we tried to, we did the therapy thing and tried to save everything.  And so, I might, there's probably some kind of relief that it came to a resolution, but  there was a lot of anger there for me.  That always makes, to me, that makes really interesting comedy.  It's like when people, I don't want to hear about someone in a great relationship. 
[02:20:30]  When a guy's writing his material and it's based around a fucking breakup that he's kind  of pissed off about, that's always good stuff because it's raw.  I like that one.  Yeah, it was raw and it was like, and that, and then when my father got sick and then they  sold that, you know, the house I grew up in was, what they sold?  They sold that, too, so that was like, oh, shit.  Why'd they sell it?  What?  So they don't have to remember Adam.  What?  They just passed his room and went, ugh.  Yeah, they have a lot of black gentlemen to move into his room.  Like, this is where it all started, Joe.  Take the deal. 
[02:21:00]  No, did they sell it?  They didn't.  Were they downsizing?  Were they moving to Florida?  Why sell?  They downsized it.  It was too big.  I mean, you remember the house.  Oh, yeah.  What about the memories, man?  It was like Tony Soprano's house.  We're doing the same thing with our family house that we all grew up in, and you'd like  to think your childhood home will always be there.  No.  Yeah, and it's not.  And you know what?  The real scary part is when you go home and it is there and it's changed, because it had  the grandma house smell when I'm towards the end.  Oh, boy.  You know, the moth balls and shit. 
[02:21:30]  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you know.  And then we were cleaning out the medicine cabinet.  There was, I swear to God, remember the upstairs bathroom, man?  I found, like, broma seltzer and a box of leeches.  It was like, well, this old shit that we see, man.  Oh, wait till you clean everything out.  You're going to see all the shit that you forgot about.  Any money in the walls or anything that has to be a...  No, that's, you know, that they remembered.  But, you know, the Civil War chess set, who want that? 
[02:22:00]  You know, that kind of shit I could have.  Well, it's like, I wasn't sure if, like, you said that after your dad got sick, you  sold the house.  I was like, well, do they need money or something for medical care?  My parents sold art, a grow-up house, too.  I was like, man, get rid of it.  Yeah.  I loved it, but it was like, I saw it one more time, and I was like, ah, fuck it.  Let them move to a smaller place.  I never had one.  It was always moving every goddamn year, two years.  Why would you?  There was a murder on the floor.  Migratory.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, you know, that wasn't my grown-up house, though.  I didn't, I don't have one house that I actually grew up in. 
[02:22:30]  I was just wishing that would happen when you lived there.  Yeah, it's not like the Brady house where we have to haunt this to keep it, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  What was that one about?  They were going to sell the house?  They were trying to scare the AIDS out of dead.  They were trying to scare any potential buyers away by saying there were ghosts in the house,  and they realized it was easier just to have Dad cut himself with some razor blades and run around the house. 
[02:23:00]  And spin like a helicopter.  Do some spin art in the kitchen.  Or Alice, wear one of Sam's sausage links as a strap-on and rape the potential buyers over Mike's shitty fucking house drawings.  Look, it's a house with a giant helmet on it.  That's a cock, Mr. Brady.  We can't, no one wants to buy that.  Ah, shit.  All right, so it premiered.  That's cool, man.  You're on, it's on Friday night at 11 o'clock, which means it probably is uncensored, right?  No, I think they cut it, it's the 44 minutes, so I'm sure it's, I forget which material they took, 
[02:23:30]  but I'm sure there's a couple of beefs in there, but the DVD is uncensored.  Yeah, Adam wants people to buy the DVD.  Adam, rescue me, I'm a little behind, but God damn, you're doing well on Rescue Me this season.  Oh, thank you, pal.  You've got a big part, you're a prick.  I like the turn.  I'm up to the...  Yeah, he did a heel turn.  I'm up to the episode where you're turned, you were everyone's pal in the firehouse,  and finally said, you know what, I'm too nice to you motherfuckers. 
[02:24:00]  And that scene was really, really good, man.  Really good.  Yeah, it was fun to do, screaming and yelling, so it was fun to do.  And the fight scene was great, too.  I remember shooting that.  I got to shoot off the fire extinguisher.  Yep.  Which was a lot of fun.  It's a child.  I love it.  Yeah, and the tour was great, too.  We did the...  Oh, Jim, you got that picture, right, from the Philly Theater?  I do, yes, thank you.  I already had that.  I appreciate it.  With me and the Rolling Stones on it?  That's great.  We're backstage at the Power Theater in Philly, and we'll get all the pictures in the dressing room. 
[02:24:30]  And it's a sign, it says the Rolling Stones, and on the side, it said Jim Norton.  That's great.  So, like I said, I took the picture, I sent it to him, he's like, I already have it.  No, I appreciate it, dude.  The Stones were there.  That's back in 2000...  We were off the air.  Yes, it was, 2002.  It was the Stones were doing a theater tour, and they were there, and I was there a week  after, which is the way it used to be.  Like, I would follow the Stones around a lot of times.  We had to fight out for tickets, and Mitch thought it was, like, affecting things, so  he called it off.  You had the Rolling Stones warm up the place for you.  Yeah, I like that. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  That's a nice opening act.  No kidding.  Yeah.  But Rescue Me, yeah, you guys are having a fine season.  You guys don't watch Rescue Me, right?  Why would I watch...  How about this?  We like Dennis very much.  I actually don't watch Rescue Me.  We like Dennis very much.  Why couldn't we do a walk-on as just civilians?  I tried.  I gave up on that.  But how about...  I just want to be in the distance.  In the background.  You can do it.  When we're back and shoot...  You guys are up every morning at 4 o'clock, and we're shooting.  Right.  Yeah, but we can't just show up there.  We feel stupid going, hi, can we be in it? 
[02:25:30]  He has to call and go...  We're in your show.  Look, we need a victim here.  It's a guy who runs out of the house, who just points and goes, there's a fire.  Ann, could you just say there's a fire?  There's a fire!  I'd probably sing it.  There's a fire!  Oh, gosh!  Oh, there's a fire, Rachel.  Or I'd probably say it wrong.  I'd probably say it admiringly.  Now, there's a fire!  Wrong, Jim.  You're panicking.  Your family is in the house.  Get out of here.  Get off the set.  There's a free... 
[02:26:00]  Oops.  Line?  Yes.  Sit down, Fred.  So, yeah, I think you should talk to Dennis and tell him...  If you want that to happen, I will put that into work.  Nah, the season's over.  Well, there's always another season, Hope.  It really is.  We got picked up.  We got picked up for next season.  Of course they did.  Congrats.  So, we should have fucking some sort...  Not a recurring role, necessarily, for myself.  I'd like one.  It doesn't have to happen.  Oh, who wouldn't?  Right.  But it could just be a one-episode thing, or we're all in a different one. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  One line!  Adam, could you save me a lot of TV watching?  What happens at the end of the season?  Yes.  A cliffhanger will make you want to tune in for the next season.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to ruin it.  Adam's caught with a fire hose in his hiney.  That's it.  That's not on camera, though.  Yeah, what are you doing, Chief?  Never mind.  Yeah, just turn the water on, quickly, and degrade me.  Turn the water on and forget you saw anything.  All right, so funny is how Friday, June 12th, it's on Comedy Central 11, and the DVD is 
[02:27:00]  on Amazon.  They probably have more stuff on the DVD than they normally do.  Yeah, there's the outtakes.  My parents are on it, which is pretty funny.  I showed you that, right, Ant?  Sure.  Yeah, that thing is on it, so that's pretty funny, and the photo shoot with Alex on the  cover is there, and some outtakes.  Who's Alex?  Your girl?  Alex, my girl, yeah.  Yeah, I like her.  She's fantastic.  His girl.  Thank you.  His girl is very attractive.  Oh, and you got AdamFerrara.com, huh?  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, and if you go to AdamFerrara.com, you can download my first CD for free.  Have some.  We're giving it away in the troubled economic times.  Wow.  What a guy.  That's a good idea.  I like that.  I do it just the opposite, though, and I charge more now because it makes it seem like they're  getting value.  Like, I used to charge 15 at live appearances for my CD, $45, two for $100, and I raise ticket  prices.  And as people walk out, I actually stop them and go, you want something?  Fag it, and I hand them a CD, and I hand over 50, and I keep the tip. 
[02:28:00]  You shake them down.  That's how I handle business.  That's it.  He only does segues and setups.  No punchlines.  You want the punchlines?  You got to pay attention.  Exactly.  Fill the hat and pass it up, and you get your punchlines, shit dicks.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Pass the hat.  That's where I'm stopping.  I do all joke jokes, my new actor.  It's all joke jokes.  Joke jokes.  What do you get when you cross Superman?  And you just stop.  I actually should go out and do a piece of my old act, not that anybody would want to 
[02:28:30]  see it, but I would love to do, because I only had like 15 minutes, put the joke jokes  in it, and say, this is verbatim what I used to do in 1991 or 92.  Tomatoes and cabbage thrown at you?  I like food.  Good improv.  I like the bit you used to do where you had no chin, and you were talking about your  torso, and you...  I still kind of trash myself physically, but I used to open up and go, you're looking  at me with my hair cut. 
[02:29:00]  Hold on.  Sorry.  I don't want to distract you.  Sorry.  The mod squad's walking down the hall.  Where's Peggy Lipton?  She looks in that Partridge family bus dress.  Yeah, she looks wonderful.  Hi.  There's all these fucking stalker guys around her.  I know.  Look at that mashup of Nicole.  And then Dave Matthews just walked in, with a creepy South African accent.  Dave Matthews.  What were we saying?  I was talking about my old act, and I used to do an awful joke about...  Because I used to have a crew cut. 
[02:29:30]  I go, you're looking at me like...  I look like the bastard son of Sinead O'Connor and Doogie Howser.  No, you didn't.  I did.  Did you laugh?  It would back then, 92.  I would say, I met Sinead O'Connor.  We stood side by side.  We looked like testicles.  And Governor Florio was there that night.  He came over and stood right between us.  Oh, I get it.  Because he was a dick.  Because he raised taxes.  He got a big laugh.  Yeah.  My awful ones were...  Mine was a quick impression.  Tony Danza. 
[02:30:00]  Angela.  Thank you.  That was it.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Nah, that was pretty awful.  See, at least you guys can call it your old act.  Yes.  Voss just calls it his act.  We looked like testicles.  In that voice, right?  It was awful.  That horrible put-on voice that you used to do?  I stopped doing that because I worked with Otto and George one time in fucking Pennsylvania.  And we did the whole weekend together.  As he'd go on stage in the middle of his act, George would just look at the audience and go,  We look like testicles. 
[02:30:30]  Testicles.  He just kept making fun of me and going,  Two testicles in my voice.  What a prick.  He was right.  He beat me out of that joke.  I will always fucking love Otto for that.  He beat me out of that horrible joke.  That's fucking funny.  What a prick.  Two testicles.  George.  Now, George.  Two testicles.  Oh, he tortured me.  And he was right.  He was being a friend.  Yes, he was.  He thought he was being just fucking drugged out and abusive, but I understood deep down  Otto was being a good friend.  He was helping you. 
[02:31:00]  Yes, he was.  I'll always.  Intervention.  I'll always love O. Peterson for that one.  Did we just miss Little Nicky?  Yeah, Little Nicky walked by.  God damn it.  It was a quick walk by this time.  He did.  He's running by now.  Yeah.  But he waves.  He waves like, Hey, here it is.  Yeah.  I got shit to do, guys.  Well, thank you, Adam.  Adam.  When are you coming in and saying hi to us?  Yes.  When I get back, I'm in L.A., but I'll be back.  I hope I come in and say hello and see everybody.  Look at you.  Stop by the old house.  I want to come by the compound, man.  I got some computer stuff that I don't know what I'm doing with. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, good.  So do I.  I did the Mac Film Festival, and they sent me a bunch of stuff.  They sent me Final Cut.  They sent me Logic.  Oh, that's some good stuff, yeah.  It's a great gig.  I'd love to do a Mac thing.  I'd just be in front of Steve Jobs and his weight loss.  Oh, jeez.  You're about to go over great.  Hey, how's that new Mac app?  It's a scale.  The new iPhone app where you step on it, and it just has a negative in front of it.  Good night.  Watch them hide behind the iPhone.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Steve Jobs, you look like an iPhone sideways.  Oh, shit.  Hey, what's that new app they have where you pick up the phone, and you can actually hear  the person calling you?  It's called the Verizon app.  Good night.  I don't think they'd appreciate it.  Get home safe.  Would there be a gasp?  Oh, horrible.  Collect the gasp.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  No, he didn't.  I would just start acting like Pacino and Justice for All.  I'd go, sit down, Frank. 
[02:32:30]  Remember Frank stood up.  Let's play, let's make a deal.  Adam's trying to get off the phone.  I'll give you a five-year deal for shitty service.  What are you going to give me?  An insane judge who likes to beat the shit out of phone service.  See, I tie in.  You know everything.  Jesus Christ.  Mr. Ferrara.  Bye, Adam.  Hello.  Hi, Adam.  Well, best of luck to my pal, Adam Ferrara.  Hi, my friend.  Funny as hell, Friday, June 12th, Comedy Central, 11 p.m. 
[02:33:00]  And DVD, available on Amazon.com.  Thank you, pal.  I will come in and say, oh, I'll see you guys.  All right, my friend.  Take care.  Bye, Adam.  Adam Ferrara.  That's Adam Ferrara.  Pally, we knew each other when we didn't have jobs.  Yeah.  You guys go way back.  Way back.  Way, way back.  I'm working at the Walt Whitman Fence Company in Huntington.  Dennis Leary did him a solid finally.  He's got a major role on that rest of me.  How about Dennis Leary puts us in some sort of an... 
[02:33:30]  It doesn't have to be a role that requires a lot of acting experience.  It could be one line.  Anally raped and they use a rape kit at the hospital.  I would gladly lay on a hospital gurney while they swabbed my cheeks.  And Dennis could come in and say something fucked up to me.  Looks like they really got you.  And I would just go like...  How about that, Dennis?  There's a fire.  Okay.  A man has been raped by a group of men. 
[02:34:00]  Upstairs.  One of the raping men flicked their cigarette and the man's apartment caught on fire.  Yeah.  I have burned feet.  Burned feet.  And they're swabbing my anus for semen.  Yeah.  And you walk in and you thought, smoking was bad for you.  And I just go...  I don't even have to say anything.  I can just have a bloody lip and I'll just go...  While there's a male nurse swabbing out my hiney for a rape kit, making remarks. 
[02:34:30]  You can just smash me, Dennis.  I won't say anything.  You want a break?  Then do the Ricky video?  And the tasing video of the great-grandmother?  What do you want to do?  I want to hear that bold bitch being tased.  How about we take a little break this time around?  A compliant bitch.  Yeah, because we don't...  A little break, because then we've got to get Kate Cooper and Roland back in here.  Yeah, we do.  We've still got lots of show to do.  I want to hear sexually frustrated Roland, because you know walking around with her, he's  just...  You know he wants to have sex with her.  He has to. 
[02:35:00]  But he can't.  Or he hasn't.  Or he doesn't.  She says certain trigger words and his head just sweats.  Like anything she says that's remotely sexual.  She's like, yeah, all right, I'll come.  Beat up, beat up, beat up, beat up.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, his head looks like you're...  We've got to talk about Sweden, too.  Hi-yo.  I saw him in the...  Hi-yo.  I saw him in the neighborhood.  We've got to talk about Sweden, too.  A lot of weird shit going on in Sweden.  Sweden?  Yeah, he'll get into that.  They love their booze.  I think there's no drinking age.  They've got all sorts of fun stuff going on over there. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, we'll discuss that, too.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah, we've got a grandma.  Great-grandma.  We've got into a bit of a problem.  Oopsie.  Do we know why?  No, I know nothing of this.  I know.  I didn't feel like reading that story today.  I know nothing except it ends in goodness.  You like it. 
[02:36:00]  You know, it's funny every time.  I love when tasers are used.  I love it.  Why don't we just play this and then we...  Then we'll try to figure out what happens.  Yeah, why not?  See who was in the wrong here.  Why not?  Step back and you're going to be paid.  I dare you.  Step back over there.  Put your hands on your back.  Put your hands behind your back. 
[02:36:30]  Time to get it.  I'm getting back in my car.  You're going to be paid.  Stop.  I'm getting back in my car.  No, ma'am.  Get on the ground.  Get on the ground.  Now put your hands behind your back.  Put your hands behind your back.  You're going to be paid to get it.  You're going to be paid to get it.  You're going to be paid to get it.  You're going to be paid to get it. 
[02:37:00]  817, I've got one page.  She screamed.  She did the old lady scream.  That's someone's great grin.  That's fantastic.  I'm getting back in my car.  No, you're not, dummy.  Cops are 100% right.  Yeah.  She just wanted to get back in her car.  She was scared.  Fuck her.  You know what?  What'd she do wrong?  Do we know?  Yeah, she didn't listen.  I thought she robbed a bank or something.  No, he was trying to give her a speeding ticket, and she would not sign the ticket.  She was refusing to sign the ticket.  What are those states where you've got to sign the ticket? 
[02:37:30]  She wasn't being cooperative.  Okay, so she wouldn't sign the ticket.  She was going 60 in a 45.  Is that true?  That's no big deal.  And she wouldn't sign the ticket, so then we tased her?  Well, she was just being very...  She wasn't cooperating with the officer at all.  He was just asking her to move, be a certain place,  and she wouldn't listen to him,  and then there was a point where they kind of got a little physical  because she was trying to walk past him,  and he kind of had to shove her and be like,  no, you're not passing me.  Can I play the other side of this, though? 
[02:38:00]  We're all big fans of the cop.  Did he really need a taser to subdue her?  Well, let me see.  I'm looking at the video of the dash cam now.  He opens the door.  Cops right every single time in our world, but...  Makes her step out.  The little lady, he's saying, go over here.  She's hunched over, little lady.  He pushes her out of traffic.  Now, this is a safety issue.  He doesn't want to be standing in traffic.  Okay.  He's pushing her away further onto the shoulder. 
[02:38:30]  She is just saying, I'm getting back in my car,  I'm getting back in my car.  Which means she has to get back sort of on the highway.  Now, he can't start a scuffle with her in the middle of the street.  He's, by the way, she comes up to his chest.  Yes, yes.  She's a little old lady.  She's a slight little old lady.  But you know something?  They're both in danger over there.  He did her a favor.  The bottom line is, he's got his taser out already.  He pulled his taser out.  Because, like, why don't you just turn her around and cuff her? 
[02:39:00]  Maybe he wants to do that because he can hurt her cuffing her.  Look, see, now again, he leads her back.  But she's not cooperating.  And she's walking back into traffic.  And he keeps pushing her back.  And he pushes her back and says, you stay there.  And now he's pointing the taser at her.  I'm going to tase you.  Michael Sears from Boston.  And there she goes.  You guys are only playing a tiny part of the video.  You missed a part where she said, I'll pay the ticket.  Get your shit right.  What? 
[02:39:30]  I'll pay the ticket.  What?  Right here in Brainerd?  You should not pay the ticket.  She wasn't cooperating to officer's commands.  And she wasn't signing the ticket.  There's still a line, though.  He could have just cuffed her and turned her around.  That's my thing.  He could have.  But he didn't.  Let's say hi to Kevin in North Carolina.  He's a cop.  Hi, Kevin.  What's up?  Hey, Kevin.  If you watch her from the beginning, she refuses to sign it and says, take me to jail.  So he tells her to get out of the car. 
[02:40:00]  And then at one point, she actually says, I dare you to tase me.  I think she says it twice.  It doesn't matter.  She's in the fuck.  It doesn't matter.  He's still not in danger.  Good thing she didn't say, I dare you to shoot me.  Or fuck me in the mouth and ass.  The cop is so much bigger than her.  And that's why I'm wondering, did he really need to use the taser?  Look, what was he going to do, though?  He probably could have done more damage to her, scuffling with her, breaking a bone, throwing her on the ground, than tasing her.  Turning her around as big as he is. 
[02:40:30]  This is my thing.  I'm not saying he shouldn't have cuffed the old bitch, but just turn her around as big as you are and put the cuffs on her.  She starts, look at what she does.  He puts her arm behind her back.  She spins out of it and goes to walk back to her car.  And she's walking into traffic now.  So he shoves her back onto the shoulder, points to the taser, and goes, I'm going to tase you.  And she continues to try to walk.  Ah, fuck her.  And there, fuck her in the ass.  And he even waits until he's got her off the shoulder, onto the grass, before he hits her with the taser. 
[02:41:00]  He would have done a lot more damage if he had tried to take her down.  Yeah, if you take her down, you know, the old graham cracker bones are going to bust apart.  Cops are right again?  Yeah, she wasn't.  You know what, though?  Right again?  Why should she fucking get away with that?  It's like, there's no reason.  As I'm watching it, when a cop says stop right there, you should not walk by him and say, I'm getting in my car, sonny.  I comply, and you'll be fine.  If you just fucking comply.  If you don't have anything illegal, you're not doing anything, just fucking comply. 
[02:41:30]  I get pulled over constantly.  I am a fucking, I'm notorious when I drive.  I get pulled over constantly.  And I fucking do everything they tell me to do.  I pull over nice, right away, in a safe spot, flip the lights on so they can come up to that window and see everything nice and clearly.  No fucking hassle.  Give them the shit they ask for.  That's what you do.  Really?  Yay! 
[02:42:00]  I put my right hand way down low.  Do you?  And I turn the music up really loud, preferably a rap station.  The best thing to do is keep the windows rolled up, and then reach like you put something under your seat, or you're grabbing something from under your seat, right?  And then when he comes up, it's best to fling the door open and throw your arms out the car real fast at him.  Tell them a joke, too.  They like a joke.  Like, I'll go, you ready to take your last breath, flat foot?  Flat foot.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I just joke with them. 
[02:42:30]  They know I'm kidding.  They laugh like you.  You want to hear the tasing again?  More than anything.  Yeah, let me hear that old woman.  Hey, Kevin, is it tasing or tasering?  Tasing.  Tasing.  All right.  Yes, sir.  Thank you, Kevin.  Bye, sweetie.  Once again, cops are right.  See?  Yes.  Step back and you're going to be tased.  I dare you.  Step back over there.  Put your hands behind your back. 
[02:43:00]  Put your hands behind your back.  You're going to be tased again. 
[02:43:30]  I don't think I got your hands behind you.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Jesus Christ.  She did not obey.  No, she did not.  Protocol.  You better get your head and your ass wired together,  or I will take a giant shit on you. 
[02:44:00]  What a threat.  I will take a giant shit on you.  What the fuck is that?  Like when a commanding officer is going to take a giant shit on you.  Or I will take a giant shit on you.  Because you know he probably does take big shits.  Oh, giant.  Old school marine and nom.  Giant.  Eat unhealthy.  Do you chance it, though?  What?  Giant shit?  Yeah.  Without wiring your head and assing it.  Do you chance it?  Yeah.  I think I would chance it, thinking he can't, you know, get the shit done on the spot.  He's not going to be able to work up a giant shit. 
[02:44:30]  Keith in Missouri.  Hey, Keith.  Hey.  I, uh, I'm a forward cop, and there's like a ladder that they teach you in the academy.  It's a use of force ladder.  And pepper spray and tasers come before wrestling.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know, if first you use verbal, then it's wide open hand, then it's pepper spray and tasers.  Yeah.  Then wrestling, then baton, and then pop your weapon. 
[02:45:00]  Why didn't he use, uh, pepper spray?  Uh, the weapon of choice these days is tasers.  It's a weapon of choice.  Everybody carries a taser these days.  Yeah, he'd probably kill her with pepper spray.  Why didn't he just fucking a nightsticker in the throat?  That works, too.  To all our cop friends, enjoy, enjoy the taser, because you know they're going to take it  out of your hands eventually.  Fuckers.  Yeah.  Back to deadly physical force.  But you know they're going to.  There'll be some kind of lawsuit or some fucking case, and next thing you know, they're going 
[02:45:30]  to, you know.  Oh, they already have.  Oh, there's already plenty of lawsuits, yeah.  No, I understand that, but one in particular.  Something's going to happen where all of a sudden they're like, all right, we can't use the  taser anymore.  But you know what?  That probably is safer than wrestling under the ground.  Of course.  You know what?  Anthony turned me on that.  You did?  I said that, too.  No, you're not.  No.  No, you're too busy counting calories, Jim.  Pretzel rod is 60.  I couldn't believe it.  See, I told you.  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't believe it.  Why?  One pretzel rod?  60 fucking calories.  That's impossible. 
[02:46:00]  Man, does that sound wrong?  I'll hope.  Maybe it's as big as a baseball bat.  That's the problem.  Oh, Gregorio.  Well, this guy doesn't agree with tasing.  Bonehead in Iowa.  Bonehead, did you see the video?  Because that's what turned me.  Because I was like, what?  Great grandmother getting fucking tased?  And the cop's a lot bigger.  He couldn't handle the situation.  Then Ant pointed out some stuff on the video that made sense to me.  Hi, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Hi, sir.  Hello, buddy.  What do you mean?  No, I just don't agree with that tasing, man.  She's 72 years old.  This guy had nothing better to do but pull her over for speeding. 
[02:46:30]  Nothing better to do.  First of all, that's his job.  Yeah, don't get mad, Ann.  I know, but she might have been on meds.  She might have had a bad hip.  He needed to sit down.  Too bad.  Stay home.  Have a peach.  Don't drive.  Yeah, I hear you.  Eat celery, you old fucking twat.  Stop endangering everybody with your fucking diabetes.  Fucking fat gout foot.  You're right, but these guys like to play with their toys.  I mean, you can't handle an old lady.  No, no, no.  But the thing is to handle her, she was being belligerent.  Pulling away from him. 
[02:47:00]  He could have body slammed this bitch.  Yeah.  The reason he probably tased her is because he didn't want to body slam an old lady.  Like, then it looks bad.  If you've got to wrestle her to the ground, you're probably going to break her shoulder and arm.  It's actually the best way to put her onto the ground is to tase her.  I hear you guys.  She is a citizen, too.  If she doesn't listen, she has to be punished.  Yes.  Maybe even raped.  It's like searching old ladies in airports, guys.  All right.  Uppity grandma.  I agree with that. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Punch it out.  Hey, Jimmy, how many pounds do you lose from a good tasing?  I don't know.  I imagine it depends on how much shit flies out.  I never used a taser, used physical force, retired cop.  Let's say hi to J.D. in Fort Worth.  We don't take many calls from Fort Worth.  Let's say hi to Nick Nolte from Q&A.  Nick.  We used to, I mean, I haven't been a cop in a long time, but, you know, you take your class ring and dump them in the head.  That didn't work.  You use your flashlight or your stick, and then you shoot them. 
[02:48:00]  All right, Clump Soda, J.D.  Another taser shit, a bunch of pussies out there.  Bunch of pussies.  See, this guy.  That's what they give you a big old flashlight with diesel batteries for.  That was the big, yeah, in the old days, you had that big mag light.  Now they got the little lights with the, like, the knurled serrated edge, so you could just pop people in the nose with that fucking thing and take their face off.  All the fairy sprays and tasers.  Fairy sprays. 
[02:48:30]  Faggot lights and, you know, you just give yourself a big diesel battery light and a stick, and you can go to work.  Would you take one hit from a big flashlight from a cop?  No.  Can you just imagine what that feels like?  That's why they would come to the window and hold it way up by the light part, because they would shine it in your face, and then if they had to, a flick of the wrist, and you got fucking 5D batteries over your head.  Fuck that.  Or you take your class ring and turn it over, and if they don't comply, you just dump them on the forehead.  It gets your attention real quick. 
[02:49:00]  You get, like, a whack.  That's funny.  I used to call my reminder.  This guy's a scream.  He's old school.  He's telling the truth, though.  Y'all take care.  Thank you, J.D.  Jesus.  Let me say hi to Jim in North Carolina.  Man, North Carolina's a hot spot.  Cigars and Scotch is telling Jimmy, flesh rods are calorie-free, so you could eat those.  I know.  As long as you don't swallow. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  A lot of sodium, high-sodium content.  Hey, Jim, you ever play North Carolina?  Yeah, man.  No, no, hold on.  Not you, Jim.  Yeah, man.  I have in my career.  I don't think in many years.  Seems like we got a lot of fans down there.  I absolutely would do that.  In North Carolina in general.  They're showing us.  They're showing the Air France possible the way it was.  But the big graphic.  The fucking graphic on these assholes at MSNBC.  Move your graphic.  God, what dickheads.  Even I know to pull the graphic when something good is happening in the lower third. 
[02:50:00]  What a bunch of fucking news hack douchebags.  Us, I mean.  Yes.  What did you do?  You spilled?  Goddamn blueberries all over the floor.  You knocked your blueberries off.  I was doing your.  My chair is just wheeling over them.  There's blueberries everywhere.  God.  Oh, boy.  Go ahead, Jim.  That animation doesn't look good.  It's showing that.  Yeah, we got a cold one day about my grandma, her daughter, and her granddaughter.  And, you know, we were trying to arrest her son.  And she said, you know, you ain't going to come get my son all this, that, and the other. 
[02:50:30]  We ended up arresting her grandma, the daughter, and the granddaughter.  And the grandma kicked the windows out of the car.  Really?  You know what I mean?  You can't underestimate these grandparents.  Nah.  And you can't, you know, by the time you get there, you got an audience, and you can't  just choke slam or nothing like you want to do.  You know, I agree with Jim.  Old person strength is a bizarre thing.  Does anyone know how to explain that?  These old people don't work out.  But if you ever get into a confrontation with an old person, not saying I did, but maybe  I did, their strength is pretty impressive. 
[02:51:00]  Why?  Is it the ligaments?  But they can't take a punch at that age.  Nah, they can't.  They're fighting for their life with every movement.  That's true.  That'll make you fight harder.  And you got video cameras coming out there, so you can't do really what you want to do.  But what is up with old people strength?  Old people strength, Kenny, what's that about?  Take your time.  Kenny's waltzing to the microphone.  I can't, man.  I can't waltz.  And it's casual wear.  What happened to your tie and suit?  You're sweating.  It's too hot out there. 
[02:51:30]  They're cheap with the air conditioning.  Oh, no.  With the air conditioning?  Yeah.  That's it, huh?  That's never a good sign when the company turns off the air conditioning.  Turns off the air conditioning.  Yeah.  And there must be a misconception, because I treat people the way I like to be treated.  Like lurch.  Really?  You like being beaten about the head?  Yes.  Ugh.  Would you get tased for the radio?  Yes.  You would?  I would.  Yes, I would.  I would like to say I would, but in the fucking way. 
[02:52:00]  That old lady fucking lived through it.  I'll live through it.  I don't want to go, blah, blah.  You know, you stiffen up and fall down, you look silly, you make funny noises.  Would you get pepper sprayed for the show?  Um, yeah.  No, come on, Jimmy.  Why not?  You lived through it, dude.  You would really do it?  Why not?  I want to try it anyway, just see what it's like.  What would management say?  Ask Steve to ask management.  Yep.  I want to see if...  No, say I want to be shot.  We could tase Jimmy or pepper spray him. 
[02:52:30]  And hit with a bat.  And then when they say no, say, how about tase?  They're like, all right.  I don't think they'll say all right to anything.  If I sign my life away, they might.  With anything.  Nah.  There's no way they would allow that.  Why?  They don't give a fuck about me.  David Carradine, everybody.  Oh.  This story gets better and better.  Is he here?  Where?  Where?  I don't smell him.  Oh.  He's dead.  Carradine photo reveals fishnet stocking.  So, that picture that a bunch of us were privy to. 
[02:53:00]  That was on the internet.  I think it's pretty much getting wiped off the face of the internet.  A lot of people said that can't be him because the hair is dark and it looks like...  What did we say?  They look like...  The blood was, you know, pooling in his legs and kind of made him darker.  Right.  But, it turns out, those were fishnet stockings and he was wearing a wig.  We've just seen a higher resolution image.  This is from TMZ.  They get the credit today of the photo that appears to be David Carradine's body hanging  in his hotel room.  And it shows what seems consistent with an autoerotica scenario, at least from outward 
[02:53:30]  appearances.  The photo, published by a Thai tabloid, shows a body suspended from a bar in a closet with  his hands bound together above his head.  Carradine's genitals were also tied.  There had to be someone else in this room.  There had to be.  Are they starting to talk about that anywhere?  He was probably into...  Who tied his hands like that?  He said the surveillance camera didn't show anybody coming or going from the room.  Wow.  But then again, the ex-wife said he came up with these crazy contraptions. 
[02:54:00]  So, maybe he figured out how to do that.  How to tie himself...  You know what?  Maybe he would jerk himself off with the rope with his hands.  Maybe he would have his hands held above his head and have the rope to his dick and  then jerk that way.  Maybe he could come that way.  Like pulling on the rope?  Pull the string!  Pull the string!  I don't know.  But the new sharper image also reveals what appears to be fishnet stockings covering the body.  You could also see red women's lingerie on the bed and it appears...  So, he decided not to wear the...  Yeah, he laid everything out and then just went... 
[02:54:30]  And said, you know what?  I'm not feeling the red lingerie today.  And it appears Carradine may have been wearing a dark wig.  Why the dark wig unless you're doing this for somebody else?  Maybe he didn't want to be recognized.  If he died?  No, if there was somebody else there, maybe he didn't want to be recognized.  There had to be someone else in the room.  There had to be.  Come on.  There had to be.  Come on, now.  Although there are signs this could have been a sexual act that turned accidentally deadly,  Family sources say they are still suspicious of the circumstances and have not ruled out a homicide.  Come on. 
[02:55:00]  I'm saying he was a little...  He was a naughty, naughty boy.  But the hands tied over that rod in the closet.  Not his rod.  The other one.  The one that put hangers on.  That's a little...  Well, that's a little weird.  A little odd?  Yes.  Yeah.  And our...  Well, he's not our pal.  We talked to him once.  Bodden?  Oh, yes.  Michael Bodden, yes.  That ghoul.  Is it Bodden or...  Michael Bodden. 
[02:55:30]  He is actually my pal.  They're saying it's going to be auto-erotica.  Auto-erotica asphyxiation.  Right.  Someone close to him is saying that's what it's going to be.  Choked.  Let's go to Gregory in New Hampshire.  Gregory.  Hello.  How are you?  Hi.  Yeah, I used to work at the state hospital, the mental board, and I periodically have  to subdue and wrestle, and the worst was the old ladies.  Really? 
[02:56:00]  They got strength.  I don't know what it is.  Then they screamed, stop it!  You swear to God, they have four arms.  Yeah.  Someone is suggesting it's rigor mortis.  That's where they're getting their strength from.  You smack it with their...  Chris Kenny, Fairfax, huh?  Fucking smack it with their big...  Big tit.  Fucking sweat sock full of sand tits.  He's wearing like nunchucks.  They appreciated me because I wouldn't get upset when I had to wrestle with the residents. 
[02:56:30]  But the little old ladies were...  They were very dangerous.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Maury's got the worst celebrity lookalikes on his show today.  They're horrendous.  Yeah.  What is Maury doing?  Some of these people...  He's doing this whole celebrity lookalike thing, and a lot of the people come out, and  they have to make this certain face...  To look like a celebrity.  To look like the celebrity, and the second they smile or anything... 
[02:57:00]  And they always look like a retarded version of the celebrity.  Who is that supposed to be?  Beyonce.  Is that Beyonce?  Beyonce.  Looks like a man dressed like Beyonce.  It's just a good Halloween costume.  If you go to a Halloween party, some of these people look like the celebrity.  That's all these celebrity lookalikes do.  Yeah.  It's a good Halloween costume.  Mike in Munaki.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Do you know Pat?  Yeah.  Actually, I live in the same place.  No way. 
[02:57:30]  It's a trailer park.  Yeah.  Not in the same street.  I'm on the other side.  All right.  He's obsessed with Pat and where he lives.  Get on with it.  He's just trying to give us a little GPS action on where he is.  I apologize.  What do you got, Mike?  Anyway, with Carydine, you guys are so...  You're concerned about him getting off on being touched by his dick?  Well, sometimes just the rope around it enough can get you to come without really rubbing against anything.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it happens.  How do you know that? 
[02:58:00]  Because it happens to me.  I love bondage and that type of stuff.  And it's really easy to come without even doing a thing.  Without touching it?  You're really into it.  Without touch?  Without touching it.  Without touch.  But the rope helps a little bit.  So that's enough.  Right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you can do it.  I'm so distracted.  If you're intuid into it, you can do it.  Why?  Because now they're taking people's, like, girlfriends or husbands, wives, and making them over as celebrities. 
[02:58:30]  So this slob is supposed to be Britney.  She doesn't look like Britney.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  That is really bad.  Maury, what are you doing?  And then they'll, yeah, they...  What's Maury doing?  Jesus.  Doesn't she look great?  She looks just like Britney.  She looks more like Aries Spears. 
[02:59:00]  When we return...  Shut up.  Want to get Roland in?  Yes, I want to find out.  Yes.  Sexy girl.  Bring in the Roland.  A couple of beautiful girls.  Kit Kat Club, Roland.  Yeah.  Roland's friend, Kate Cooper, came in here selling her music.  She knew how to sell it.  She brought bagels and a lot of tits.  Where's the bagels?  Bagels and tits will sell your music every single time.  I don't see any bagels, Gregorio.  I've heard about them.  If you want us to give some promotion to your fucking band, you bring in bagels and tits and we'll start talking. 
[02:59:30]  That's right.  No problem.  Or just one of each.  One of each.  Where's the bagels?  Look at Roland.  It was Roland.  I was hiding them.  Oh, he's here.  Where's the bagels?  Eric's got them.  Why does Eric have them?  I thought he only had rolls under his shirt.  Tasing was a no, by the way.  Of course.  It's already a no on the tasing?  This is the...  You know how many regular radio shows did that?  Yeah.  Oh, I do.  It's supposed to be better than regular radio.  Let's go.  This is the third incarnation of this company or the third company I have asked in five years, 
[03:00:00]  and the answer is always no.  Hmm.  But regular radio does that, and we're supposed to be...  I don't know what the loophole is.  It doesn't matter how many reams of release worms you sign either.  I'm confused by all the rules.  Give me these bagels.  Roland.  Hello.  Get up to the mic, Roland.  Yeah.  I'll turn.  Roland.  Does she have a mic on over there?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hello.  Hello.  Roland.  Where's the butter?  Jimmy wants to know about your relationship with Kate Cooper.  We've all seen you with Kate Cooper over the years.  She's very sexy, Roland, and you're a sweet, funny, masculine guy. 
[03:00:30]  So I want to know...  Wait.  This might sound bizarre.  Yeah.  Since Roland and Kate are both going to be talking, is there any way Roland and Kate can  kind of sit together?  Because I want to see them together.  Is that possible?  Yeah.  That's a very good idea.  Okay.  No, Roland.  That means you stay there, and we're going to put Kate next to you.  Oh.  Kate, would you sit on Roland's lap, or is that icky for friends?  We're crossing friend boundaries there.  Oh.  Though I did get to hear Roland singing in the back, some of those hot tracks. 
[03:01:00]  I'm a little threatened, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  He's good.  I don't know if you guys remember this.  Amazing.  He's good.  What was your favorite Roland song you heard?  Um, How We Used to Be, what was that?  What was that one?  The 80s track that we were just listening to?  Hungry Like the Wolf.  Oh, was it Hungry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You did a little Duran Duran.  Hey, Kate, come sit up here.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  I want you to next to see one.  We're rearranging.  You want her next to you, Jimmy.  No, I want to next to Roland.  They could have sat on the couch, actually.  I was hoping they'd sit on the couch.  Ah.  Hello, hello.  Hello.  Roland? 
[03:01:30]  Yes.  Jimmy wants to know what's up with the relationship.  Your friends?  Friends, yeah.  Yeah, I would like to know, because it's tough to have a friend that's that hot.  I am charming, too.  You're very sweet.  But, you know, you're also very sexy.  And Roland's a very virile young man.  Hi-yo.  Hi-yo.  Hi-yo.  Hi-yo.  Brady, why?  His nickname around here was the Cummeister.  Cridang, gang, cridang, gang, cridang.  Did you guys ever fool around?  No.  What, do you want to, Roland? 
[03:02:00]  I don't know.  It's just, we've been friends.  It's just like, you don't...  She's kind of like a sister at this point?  Yeah, it's kind of like when you're friends, you know, like, you have no shots.  It's kind of like, all right.  There's no heterosexual guy, by the way, that says, oh, she's like a sister to me.  Nope.  Because, unless, you know, you're fucking your sister or want to fuck your sister.  Sure.  Because you would have sex with a girl that you are friends with.  Platonic friends.  You would.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's when you get alcohol involved.  That's the only way. 
[03:02:30]  Well, exactly.  Or roofies.  Same way you have sex with your sister.  Yeah.  Alcohol involved.  Yeah.  So now, how long have you known each other?  Four years.  Four years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you started out working relationship, thing like that?  Yeah.  And then, how did this friendship get sparked up?  She said a racist comment, and I was like, wow.  Cool.  No, I'm just kidding.  I think I actually brought pizza into the office at, like, I think it must have been, like, 
[03:03:00]  six in the morning, or something ridiculous like that, and I was way hungover eating pizza  alone in the corner, and Roland just sits down next to me, and it was a beautiful moment.  That sounds delicious.  Sounds great.  You bonded over pizza farts?  Yeah.  The best relationships begin.  Lactose farts.  They were just waving at each other, falling in love.  It was a fucking Sarah McLachlan song playing.  So, Roland, do you get any kind of vibes from Roland that he kind of likes you? 
[03:03:30]  No, it's totally cool.  I mean, I've never, it's always been just real chill and good relationship, you know?  Can you tickle Roland for us?  Can I tickle Roland for you?  Would you allow a tickling from him?  Have you ever heard this?  Oh, yes.  Okay.  It's part of why I love him.  And he asks, like, about the sleeping.  That goes out the window pretty much.  Wouldn't it be funny if she tickled Roland and he punched her off the chair? 
[03:04:00]  He just got a big violence.  And then came in his pants.  Tickle punched up.  It's the new doll from Tyco.  Ah, shit.  Fucking laugh gets me every time, man.  So what?  Did you ever kiss Roland?  No.  No.  How about a peck on the cheek?  Did you have a peck on the cheek?  What is this, like, truth or dare?  Yeah, I'm asking.  I'm asking if you ever kissed Roland.  Go shake seven minutes in the closet.  I'll go and kiss on the cheek.  That's fine.  Mwah.  Aw.  Isn't that funny? 
[03:04:30]  Well.  So you...  Yeah.  I'm just saying, so now you're friends and stuff.  But you hang out more than just, like, working friends.  So how did you break the ice?  Did you say you want to go somewhere tonight?  Or...  We used to have to go to movie screens all the time.  Oh, so you had to for work.  For work.  And then we started hanging out.  Yeah, and then, like, alcohol.  I was like, hey, alcohol will make it better.  And I'm like, yes, it will. 
[03:05:00]  Did you cut the bottom of the popcorn box out at the theater for a little joke?  No, because I actually eat the popcorn.  Oh, yeah.  Unfortunately, I don't go that far.  He actually cut the hole and put his cock in, but he'd slap her hand away every time she  reached in.  He just doesn't push the popcorn up so it's easier to get.  Roland's a smart boy.  And then how come it didn't progress any further?  Like, there's always a moment, even during a platonic friendship relationship, where something 
[03:05:30]  is attempted.  Maybe over some drinks or something.  You try to take it to that next level, and somebody, you know, kind of pushes back, and  then you go back to friendship.  Did you ever try?  Did you ever?  No, because she's always had a boyfriend, so it's like, never.  Yeah.  The little fella.  And that matters how?  Why?  When?  Who?  Because he hangs out with people.  What the fuck is that? 
[03:06:00]  What is that?  What is that?  Oh, shit.  Roland.  Jesus.  I'm scared.  Hangs out with people.  And then he, with one move, explained what kind of people.  So the boyfriend would hang out with certain people.  Yes.  Was the boyfriend a certain person?  No.  Oh.  Because they call that damaged goods.  Almost. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  Mama raised me right.  He almost went down a few notches on the old popularity scale here.  Even Howard Hughes would go, uh-uh.  So, oh, but he would hang out.  So, you know, you didn't want any shenanigans like that.  You never know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, but you did, you kind of wanted to, I would assume.  She, you know, she's a pretty girl.  Mm-hmm.  You're basically heterosexual. 
[03:07:00]  And she has a sexy vibe.  She's not just pretty.  Her vibe is very sexy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, you've known each other four years.  Yeah.  So, Jesus Christ, you were a real little tater tot back then, huh?  Oh, yes.  Little young, naive, little.  Dipped me in some sweet and sour sauce.  What do you got?  You want some, Mom?  You want a bite of my rice cake?  It's the food of love.  Oh.  Jimmy, look at all the shit he's got in front of him.  Jimmy has.  How are you going to calorie count all that stuff? 
[03:07:30]  He's got bagels and rice cakes and peanut butter for the rice cakes.  And the cold red.  You're a psycho.  Hey, can you explain everything?  Let me take a look.  I don't even know what this is.  He's got peanut butter, a rice cake, a half a bagel.  He's got a banana.  And what's the cold medicine?  It's a smorgasbord for the homeless.  All washed down by a dyed ginger ale, by the way.  What do you got?  Peanut butter on that thing?  Reduce fat, motherfucker.  Reduce fat, peanut butter. 
[03:08:00]  I took a couple of bites out of the bagel.  A couple of bites out of a poppy seed bagel.  And there's horrid looking rice cakes there.  What are they?  Just plain?  I hope so.  Not flavored or anything?  Salted.  Why would you get salted when I'm trying to lose weight?  Who bought the rice cakes?  Oh, shit.  You're going to be so bloated.  Oh, no.  You're going to have to factor that in.  Pick up your iPhone and start punching away.  I don't want to.  Punching away at those keys.  I'd rather not.  Why would they get me salted rice cakes? 
[03:08:30]  Tim, you also want to know more about Kate's what?  Scenario.  The relationship scenario.  Yeah.  Oh.  What more would you like to know?  Well, I mean, how the sexual stuff starts.  Like, let's just say this.  Like, they have a character thing.  Generally, they just put the money on the table and then you get down to business.  Let's say you and Roland weren't friends.  Okay.  Let's just say that Roland was a guy that you were going to sleep with.  How you doing?  Yeah.  How you doing?  And you were playing with the hooker scenario. 
[03:09:00]  We're rolling at you in the hotel.  Or you mean, Rolando, in this case.  Rolando.  I got paces.  And you show up in your little sexy outfit.  How would the physical start?  Generally, with something like that, the male starts it.  Say Roland.  Don't say the male.  Oh, say Roland starts it.  Yes.  But, you know, they kind of come in and usually it's someone that you've been with before.  So, it's kind of like, how does anything get started?  You know, either one person starts or the other. 
[03:09:30]  It's kind of, you know, you can play that kind of cat and mouse game for a little bit  or you just get right down to it.  It's kind of however the mood is at that moment, you know?  Great.  Roland, you're hurting your cause.  Do you like to spank guys?  Yeah.  You do?  Have you ever been spanked?  Yeah.  Who, me?  Yeah, you.  Other than my mother, no.  Do you like being spanked?  I don't know.  Probably not.  What comes out of my ass?  You know? 
[03:10:00]  You never had, like, just one smack on your ass?  Spank doesn't necessarily have to be, you know, get over my knee and then whack, whack,  whack.  It could just be a quick swat of the hiney.  A little swat?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  No, huh?  You might like it.  Never happened?  A little swat in the backside.  What are you suggesting, Jimmy?  I think that maybe, if Roland is interested, maybe she could give him a little swat in  the hiney.  Maybe you would like it.  It's okay. 
[03:10:30]  No?  What's your pants on?  We do have to hang out after this.  That's the beauty of it.  We make it really awkward.  We make it totally uncomfortable.  It's a good time.  Roland's been a trooper for four years.  He obviously values you as a person.  And he's not asking us to do this.  He's probably uncomfortable.  But he obviously likes you as a person and values you.  So I'm saying, like, you know, to give Roland a little bit.  I want her to, you know.  It's okay.  I know it's uncomfortable for Roland, but. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, it really is.  Look at him.  I know.  He's a good guy.  Let's not do that to him.  Would you?  Squirming.  How about, um.  Would.  A tug of the balls?  Would you have.  Perhaps.  I'll take the other.  How about this?  See this.  If Roland had made some advances, being the guy he is, he's very funny, outgoing, fun guy  and everything like that.  I was probably a very good lay.  If he, if he made advances, would you have been receptive?  Probably not.  No.  I just, you know.  Why is that? 
[03:11:30]  Because I was with, I was with my boyfriend.  No, no, no boyfriend stuff.  No boyfriend stuff.  Oh, the boyfriend stuff.  Like, you didn't have a boyfriend.  He detonates.  And no.  Fuck it.  Let's just say there was no boyfriend in the scene.  Yeah.  And it was before you and Roland are now this impenetrable barrier of friendship that really  fucks things up, doesn't it, Roland?  And, uh, and, uh, would you have been receptive to maybe a little more, uh, you know, had  he serenaded me with that hungry, like a wolf back in the day, you know, drinks, right? 
[03:12:00]  A few drinks, a little hungry, like the wolf back to his place.  Yeah.  Do you like a flat for some pizza and fart?  Probably a hotel.  I could have a walk up.  It's like 110 stairs.  By the time they get up, they're all sober.  What the hell?  What am I doing here?  It's I need a hotel.  Oh, what the hell?  Like, I'm sober.  They can't breathe.  They're catching their breath.  Like, can't have a water?  And then they go, oh, I gotta go.  I'm like, yeah, I thought so. 
[03:12:30]  Who are you and why are you striking me with a garbage can, ladies?  Do you like to spend girls?  Um, certain race.  Oh, no, no.  How do you expect you to do it?  Why do you point at me?  I have a reputation to uphold.  No, no, I haven't really spanked a girl.  No.  What about when you're following a girl up the stairs?  You're a little pshh on the ass?  I have to take 110 stairs. 
[03:13:00]  Get out of my way, bitch.  It's a little grandmother slapping her ass.  Move.  A little playful thing as they're, you know, walking in front of you.  Yeah, it's a hike, yeah.  Yeah.  What's the sexiest thing she's ever done in front of you?  Wear that shirt right now?  Yeah.  Um, I guess I can remember because usually when we get wasted at her, she goes, she's  insane when she's drunk.  Did she rip her top off and stuff?  No, like we went to a party and Tracy Morgan was there and she started hitting him, started 
[03:13:30]  going crazy and then he walked by me and goes, man, she had a bag full of crazy and just  ran right out.  A bag full of crazy.  And he just ran right out.  I was throwing food at him.  I wasn't hitting him.  I was throwing chocolate at him.  You hit him twice.  Here's an indicator that you're a fucking nut when Tracy Morgan leaves.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he just left right out.  He goes, I'm done.  Wow.  Yeah.  So did she ever like, did she ever get naked in front of you when she was drunk?  No.  Really?  Oh, really?  No. 
[03:14:00]  You ever seen her in a thong?  No.  You don't see her in a high day?  What's the most undressed you've ever seen her?  Today, probably.  Really?  Yeah.  She's always cold.  What about you?  What's the most undressed you've ever seen rolling?  In a thong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the thong game.  Actually, I'm trying to get Roland to do a YouTube video with me where I'm singing my music  and he's just dancing naked behind me.  That would be wonderful.  Yeah.  Or a Speedo.  I mean, I'm flexible here.  That would do well.  I think that'd be fantastic.  Have you seen this?  I think he's got it. 
[03:14:30]  You're a husky boy, but that's all right.  Exactly.  He's a man.  But he moves.  He's a man.  So would you, how about this?  I know you're not going to get naked because you guys are friends.  But what can we do to bribe you to say, show Roland and us your ass in a thong?  Which is basically beach.  A bathing suit.  Oh, yeah.  Beach wear.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, just pretend we're in Brazil, baby. 
[03:15:00]  I mean, I don't like that.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  It's not like a thong is not nude.  I'm not saying I have a sneeze coming.  All right.  You okay now?  Yeah.  So what can we do to...  Cock sneeze.  Look at that breast just kind of...  No, don't take it away.  Don't take it away from us.  It's shy.  You can't just point it out.  No, it's like nice and meaty.  Another track.  Yeah, but how about this? 
[03:15:30]  Roland is right.  We have another track.  Like, maybe we could play a little bits from whatever as we...  Like, let's make a deal, like Opie suggested before.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's a lot of listeners.  There's a tremendous amount of people listening.  And you are good.  Oh, see, they closed the curtains, so now you've got to do something.  Oh, now I have to?  Yeah.  I'll show my ass for another track.  Okay.  Oh.  We'll play...  How about this?  We'll play two minutes of the track of your choice.  All right.  How about Star?  Okay. 
[03:16:00]  It's a little fitting.  I already threw the disc out, so if you have another one...  Oh, my God.  We have the disc.  It feels so special.  You know how to make a copy.  Yes, you should show Roland.  Jimmy, can I have you a copy?  I don't have my copy right now.  I don't know why.  What the fuck's happened to it?  Can I see the thing?  Yeah, what track is it?  Let me find out.  So we have to see Roland in a thong?  Why?  No.  I'm four.  Her.  Oh, I'm so stupid. 
[03:16:30]  I'm sorry.  Dude, you actually delivered that very good.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was so deadpan.  I was like, Jesus.  Did I fuck up?  What track?  Four?  Yeah, track number four.  Okay.  All right.  So are you going to play it first?  I would say ass first because I want to eat.  Does she have to get on the stage?  No.  I would say she could stand here.  She might be uncomfortable on the stage and fall.  She has shoes on.  It'll be too awkward.  Yeah.  Because it's like penguin pants.  I mean, it's such an awkward thing.  Like, hey, just show me your ass. 
[03:17:00]  Like, no, I'm like penguin pants.  It's not bad.  It's okay.  You won't judge me for my penguin pants.  It's never bad when you're wearing, yeah, pants around your knees or something.  Does Roland spank her too?  No, no, no, no.  Don't go crazy.  We made a deal, my friend.  Yeah, we'll give her two minutes if she just, she has to give a nice show of her hiney,  which is, again, a pretty innocent thing.  I would like to see him.  Roland doesn't have to look, but he'll probably look out of courtesy because he's a fair guy.  Yeah.  I don't want to kill F out of the group.  Right.  Exactly.  All righty.  Do you like how I do all this for me under the guise of helping Roland? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, we're not stupid.  I don't think there's a person out there that's stupid enough to buy into it.  All righty.  What's she saying?  Can you take off your long skirt?  She's very sexy, though.  It's like she...  Buckle comes to the...  She dresses sexy.  Oh, yes.  Little pants.  What kind of pants?  What kind of underwear?  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Move a little bit there.  Am I in the way?  There we go.  No, you're not in the way.  All right.  Roland, have you ever seen her ass before?  Oh.  Can you turn this way a little bit?  She has a really... 
[03:18:00]  And turn towards Roland.  She has a really...  What is that tattoo, Roland?  I actually...  She has a tattoo on her ass.  She's like a transformer.  It's an angel.  Oh, angel.  Wow.  I was 13.  It was Florida.  You got an angel tattoo on your ass at 13?  Oh, God.  She's a dirty Florida girl.  I love her.  It's during my rebellious phase, you know?  Yeah, man.  She's in Florida.  Oh, she's a trooper.  Yeah.  How'd you pay the tattoo guy for that?  Actually, I showed him my ass, basically.  Yeah.  It was pretty cheap.  I had a fake ID back then. 
[03:18:30]  Of course it was cheap.  It took him three weeks to do it.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, no.  And of course, like, you know, I'm 13 and a moron, so I, like, drew it on a piece of  paper.  I'm like, I'm going to draw a beautiful angel for my ass.  Like, whatever the fuck that means.  But, like, so I handed it to the guy that has these little, like, boobs on it and da-da-da  and he's, like, afterwards, he's like, yeah, well, I gave her bigger tits because, you  know, it's always just better that way.  Oh, my God.  Class act.  Yeah, okay.  It's all class.  Tattoo artist is like, we're going to need 20 sessions to get this tattooed on. 
[03:19:00]  It's really intricate.  How old were you when you lost your virginity?  14.  See, I knew she was.  How old was the guy?  16.  Okay, she was, like, a boyfriend?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Did you ever have somebody, like, a lot older when you were, like, 16, 17?  Mm-mm.  That was kind of skewed me out.  I was like, what the fuck are you doing with me?  Oh, these guys your own age?  Yeah.  Generally, I mean, like, the oldest was, like, you know, eight years different, something  like that.  That's not that bad.  Well, it's not, like...  Well, you're 17 years old, you're 25.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, that sucked if the guy was 16.  Here's Star by Jim Cooper.  Great ass, by the way.  Yes.  You're gonna take it so long, but the night's too young.  Time to hit the city, baby.  Time to sell cheap and love.  One last cigarette and one wet dream. 
[03:20:00]  Things can't be as bad, baby.  As bad as they seem.  You're gonna get your picture on the cover of a magazine.  You're a star.  Star, star, star, star.  Baby, you're gonna be a star.  While we cried, I didn't know that pain was salty and hot, baby. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, did they catch your name now?  Oh, baby, stars don't cry now.  You better clean your face.  Yeah, you got to break that smile right back in this place.  You're gonna get your face up on the silver screen.  Because, I'm a star.  Stop, stop, star, star, baby.  Stop!  Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
[03:21:00]  Baby, you're gonna be a star.  Stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  For the cover of a magazine  Your face up on that silver screen  To the star 
[03:21:30]  Star, star, star, star  Baby, you're gonna be a star  Be the star  Star, star, star, star  Baby, you're gonna be a star  I like it.  Whoa.  Listen to you with your rugged voice.  I thought you only did that smooth, silky voice stuff. 
[03:22:00]  I don't know.  Go a couple ways.  I really like the beat of that, too.  A little ska sounding.  Yeah.  Old Jamaican Island, Scott.  That's right.  Kate Cooper Music dot com.  You got it.  Because people are like, you're not plugging her music.  Yeah, and I'm on MySpace as well.  And also, you know, MySpace forward slash Kate Cooper Music as well.  Kate Cooper showed her pooper.  And we thought it was super duper. 
[03:22:30]  Hey, Roland.  Can we be any less much?  I know.  You see Roland standing over her naked body.  Someone call a state trooper.  You haven't talked to Roland in a while.  How was Sweden, man?  It was fine.  It's just the company was Baudel.  Right.  So they cut it short, but they paid me for the full stay.  Yeah.  So it was just fun.  You were entertaining the hell out of me, you and your brother talking about Sweden.  Tell these guys some of the stuff that went on in Sweden while you were there.  Pretty much, though.  When you get to work there, they drink at work. 
[03:23:00]  They drink at work in Sweden.  Pretty much.  The beer's like 18%, and they have their own little cake.  Holy shit.  It's almost like an Anthony bar there at their office.  Oh, really?  Every office or just the place you happen to be at?  Well, the place I was at, all levels had a bar there.  They had, like, tap on keg.  And people just drink during the day at work?  Did you drink during the day?  Tap on keg?  Or wear a keg.  Good catch.  They had draft bottles.  What?  Do they look drunk?  Um, no.  They really hold a liquor. 
[03:23:30]  Who the fuck can tell it to them?  Hang the, hang the, hang the, what?  No.  Hang the, hang the, hang the, hang the, hang the.  Bunch of fucking Swedes.  And no drinking age?  Uh, I think 16 you can start drinking.  16?  Nice.  How's the beer?  Tastes good?  It's good, but it's really strong, because I got wasted one night.  I had, like, eight beers, 15 shots.  Is it warm or cold?  Ice cold.  Oh, okay.  In England, they'd bring it warm, right?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had to take a cruise ship from Sweden to Finland. 
[03:24:00]  And then, uh, they had an idea that I run pretty much naked and jump off the bow into  the Baltic Sea.  So, I said no, but I got drunk and did it.  And, uh.  Off the bow?  Yeah.  It was the bottom.  Off the bow.  I'm trying to, did he mean boat?  Did he mean bow?  It's a cruise ship, but they have, like, the bottom where it's not that high up.  We just jump right in.  You jumped naked into the Baltic Sea?  Yeah.  Well, they had, uh, like, a wire to pull me up, but when you jumped down. 
[03:24:30]  Wire?  Like a David Carradine hookup?  You know what?  Pretty much.  Right on his neck.  Pretty much, but when you jumped down, I didn't realize how deep it was.  It's the ocean.  I know.  I know.  It's a cruise ship in it.  I was drunk.  I don't know.  It's a cruise ship in it.  Exactly.  He's trying to touch his body with his toes.  I think this is over my head.  Let me, let me just break in for a second.  I got an instant feedback, and it's true.  This is how fucking powerful this goddamn show is.  Kate Cooper has five new friends on MySpace. 
[03:25:00]  Number one on Google Trend right now.  Oh, my God.  And we didn't even go for a Google bomb today.  Wow.  Look at that.  You're the number one search right now.  I'm better than the amputee?  Kate Cooper.  What the fuck?  Yeah, watch it be a bunch of stump fuckers chasing the other one.  They turn this show off, and they're looking for the other one.  Get these tits out of here.  We don't want tits.  We want fucking a handless Kate Cooper.  You got some exposure today.  Yeah.  Literally.  Oh, okay.  How are the people over there rolling?  They're nice. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, they're just, because, I mean, they're kind of standoffish at first, but they're really nice.  But just everything, they're so expensive.  25% tax on everything.  God.  Is there an income tax?  Yeah.  Well, it's like the workers there, they get taxed like 32% or something like that.  But it's probably health care.  They get covered in everything.  But if you're visiting, you're just fucked.  Like, we went to like a 7-Eleven.  They're everywhere.  Got eight cups of coffee for the crew.  It's $55 US.  What the fuck? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, seriously.  Really?  Yeah.  We're going to charge you for milk and cream.  Yeah, because my brother bought beers and everything for the crew and nachos.  My brother goes, I got this, no problem.  Then he went online, it was like $385.  It turned out to be a problem.  And my brother's like, fuck.  Yeah.  And what's the restaurant they love more than any other restaurant over there?  TGIF.  They go, thank God, it's Friday.  We all meet.  And then you meet there and they go, they have chicken and bacon sandwiches for all. 
[03:26:30]  They love TGIF.  What's the dollar translation there, though?  Every day, it just comes, I'm getting crappier than the dollar.  Is it equal?  What?  A Swiss Kroner?  A Swiss Kroner?  Is a Kroner more than a dollar?  Yeah.  I hate the fucking Swiss.  Really?  Kroner.  We should attack them.  Really?  We should attack them with fucking chemical weapons for no reason.  And then dare the world to do something.  Well, they're going to get the first 4G network soon, too.  They get it before us, yeah.  Fuck them.  And movies. 
[03:27:00]  I'm trying to think of some of the stuff you were telling me.  Yeah, we went to the movies where you buy your movie ticket and they sign you the seat.  Oh, that's what it was.  Yes.  Yeah, it's the most bizarre thing.  Do they do it racially, hopefully, so you can hear the movie?  Yeah.  That's a great concept.  Yeah, so you just go.  It's actually a seating chart and you're like, all right, I'll take these two seats right there.  Even though the theater's half empty, people follow the rule.  And they're really clean.  They clean up after themselves.  I just eat like an animal, like I always do.  And people are just like pointing and talking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that dumb language. 
[03:27:30]  Fat people over there?  Just me and my brother, yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're all thin and they all look like supermodels, all the girls.  You guys must have been gods there, though.  You were different.  Yeah, they pointed at us.  You and Roger should have pulled a few trains.  Got a few of those snooty models.  Yeah.  No?  All right.  That's right.  Tanner in Fargo.  StopSimonaHalep.com.  It's now news-friendly.  But SaveTheTitMonster.com will still get you there as well. 
[03:28:00]  Ah.  For that young tennis player that has the big bosoms and she's thinking of breast reduction  surgery so she can play better.  It's a sin.  And we say, hell fucking no.  So now we've got a news-friendly site and, of course, the famous SaveTheTitMonster.com  all going to the same place.  Have you ever seen that tattoo before?  No.  That's a big tattoo for the ass.  Yeah, I know.  It's dirty.  A lot of girls go too big with their-  When I've been down, you're in heaven.  What can I do?  But a lot of girls go too big with their tattoos.  Why?  I don't know. 
[03:28:30]  We like them, man.  They're a little addictive, you know?  It's to each their own, you know?  She's a fucking dirty Florida girl.  That is so sexy.  That would be so nice to spank.  I love it when people call me a dirty Florida girl.  I say that lovingly.  I don't mean that in a bad way, either.  Florida girls are very sexy.  They're fucking really hot.  What's the dirtiest thing you did that you're willing to admit?  With a man of color.  Have you ever crossed races?  No.  Always white guys?  Mm-hmm.  Spanish?  No.  Okay.  Dirtiest thing.  Yeah, I hope he's right. 
[03:29:00]  She's an Aryan.  I know.  What's the dirtiest thing you ever did?  We beat up a Jew while having sex.  What did you say is the dirtiest thing you ever did?  Oh, God.  I don't even know.  I'm going to have to think on that one.  I mean, between the role playing, I mean, we do a lot of that.  And got into the S&M a little bit.  And sometimes anphyxiation.  You were being choked?  Yeah.  You like being choked?  I tried it.  I didn't like it that much.  Why?  Because she likes air.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:29:30]  Because I like to breathe.  Okay.  You know, but I mean, off the top of my head, there's nothing all that dirty.  I know.  I just didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  I mean, I'm open to try everything, but it wasn't what I wanted.  Yeah.  Do you have anal sex?  Do you like that enough?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  You may add to that.  Everyone just had to dwell on that for a second.  Are we saying Swiss when it's Sweden?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever the fuck.  You figure it out at home.  They're blonde and we could kick the shit out of them.  What do they eat?  Oh, they eat some kind of berry, you were telling me, Roland. 
[03:30:00]  It's like some weird cranberry they put on every fucking dish and it tastes like crap.  Everything's like plain.  It's like sweet berry.  What's it called?  A dingle?  They just give it to the Americans.  And they'll enjoy this.  I heard the fuck.  I hanged it, I hanged it.  I got the corner, then the dime.  I love it when Jimmy speaks foreign languages. 
[03:30:30]  I'm very good.  Next vacation, I'm doing Anthony's Disney World.  I hanged it, I hanged it.  It's easy that way.  Just go around Epcot.  Visit all these countries and you're right there.  Happiest place on earth.  The world in one afternoon, right?  Yeah, exactly.  I was just distracted by a story.  This has to be...  What happened?  What adult this person is.  What happened?  Someone made a prank call to an Arkansas Holiday Inn.  And said they were with some alarm company. 
[03:31:00]  And then told the person that they were doing a test.  The person that worked at the hotel?  Yeah.  And that they had to pull the fire alarms.  So the person actually did this.  How hilarious is that?  Then it didn't stop there.  They then told the person that in order to stop the alarm from going off,  they had to break the windows.  So the person picked up a chair and a fire extinguisher  and started breaking the windows to this place. 
[03:31:30]  And then they told the person that in order to keep the fire sprinklers from going off,  that the person would have to break off one of the heads of the...  Get the fuck out of here.  ...closed $50,000 in damages just from the person on the phone.  So who's in trouble?  Now, I don't know.  I don't think they ever caught the guy that did the prank. 
[03:32:00]  But the person wreaking havoc?  Yeah, I would...  Prankster told...  Wow.  What a great prank.  Write that down.  Let's do that one in a month.  Well, didn't they do that with having people strip searched  in the back of fast food restaurants or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Who got blamed on that one?  One of our favorite videos of all time, Kate Cooper.  That girl is a dummy.  Remember that one, Kate?  Right.  That is one of the hottest videos ever.  I don't feel bad for anybody in that scenario. 
[03:32:30]  If you're that stupid, get a complete strip search.  And didn't she start doing jumping jacks and everything?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God, Dan.  You love that one, too, right?  It's definitely a good one.  It's solid.  How much better something actually fell out while she's doing, like, jumping jacks?  My favorite part of that is, like, when she's sitting up on the counter  and then he's, like, on his knees, like, inspecting, like, inside of her.  And what was the reason, again, that she got completely nude?  Because they said that she had to be strip searched 
[03:33:00]  because I think she was accused of stealing or something.  And it's a fast food restaurant, like...  Yeah, what are you stealing?  Is this it?  Is this the video?  Yeah.  Where can people go?  We haven't promoted this video in a while.  If you just search out, like, McDonald's strip search, you'll find it.  Yeah, you guys are smart enough.  That's so funny.  It's an amazing piece.  Oh, my God, is that hot?  Did she get spanked or something?  Wasn't there another guy that was involved?  Oh, my God.  The old guy with the horseshoe.  She's bent over, naked, and he's, like, spanking her. 
[03:33:30]  I hate that blur.  Yeah, I got to find the unedited.  Doesn't the guy know it's a scam?  Was the manager involved with it?  I don't...  I forget how this all played out.  The guy had to know it was a scam.  Somebody on the phone got him to do this whole thing.  He's behind her, naked, smacking her ass.  Like, I don't know.  How bad do you want to keep your job?  Apparently, he didn't.  Just leave.  I know.  You're 17 or whatever.  Just leave.  Oh, my God.  How great is this?  The authorities will figure it all out.  Fuck. 
[03:34:00]  My luck.  I get the wrong McDonald's employee.  Pull your pants down.  Uh-uh.  Excuse me.  Fuck.  Put the white girl on the phone.  Yeah.  That's such a white girl thing.  You wouldn't get a black girl to do that.  No fucking way.  They're too smart for that shit.  Worker forced to strip and give BJ?  What?  Wowee.  Wow.  There's a new one?  Sirius radio employee, Eric Nagel. 
[03:34:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  I always apologize to E-Rock immediately after, because I know he's going to snap one day  and break one of our jaws.  I don't want it to be mine.  Okay.  I'm watching some of the videos.  That's the same video.  There's no.  There's nobody getting.  Cubed out.  What?  They're just pumping up the video to get more views?  Yeah.  I don't think you need to.  It's more news where they blur it out.  I know I have the unedited somewhere.  She's pretty.  Wow.  Wait.  There's an unedited?  Yeah.  Did we ever see the unedited?  I can swear.  I don't fucking think I ever saw the unedited. 
[03:35:00]  Well, you can see her, uh, fart box.  Yeah.  Want to see this shitter?  We just wait until the video pops up.  We got to get off the air anyway.  We got a sales meeting today.  Oh, shit.  I want to go in the other room and call so bad.  We all got shit.  Let's go.  Kate Cooper, have you been stealing?  I have no work to do.  Oh, did you steal something from our office?  That's why I want to go call from there.  And then just jack off in Travis's beard. 
[03:35:30]  His beard?  While Kate strips and proves that she has not stolen my peanut butter.  I would call.  Even if I got her naked, I'd probably say something really fucked up.  Like, could you open your vagina?  We're missing eight bagels.  What?  Naturally.  I would just lose it.  I lost my Jif peanut butter and my cowboy hat.  Is it under your clitoris?  Click.  But up to that point, you played it perfectly.  Yeah, I would be doing really good.  Everything's perfect.  You're like, oh, man.  This is going way better than I thought.  As soon as the clothes came off, I would fucking fall apart. 
[03:36:00]  You'd panic.  I don't want to get in trouble.  And then she'd, like, take her pants off.  Open your asshole.  I think my cock is lost.  Wait, I didn't mean that.  Fuck.  Anything else about Sweden as we wrap up there, Roland?  No, not really.  All good?  Yeah, all good.  Kate Cooper?  Yeah, katecoopermusic.com.  Thank you for showing us your money.  It really was lovely.  I'm going to go see All Five Nights with Bruce.  Oh, that's right.  Have fun.  I'm so excited.  Hey, let's really get out of here. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, we got to go.  Like, not wait until...  I just want to ask, Roland.  It's a quick question.  The Hangover.  Mm-hmm.  I loved it.  People love it or hate it.  I liked it.  You liked it, right?  I loved it, yeah.  Roland's pretty tough in the movie theater.  He didn't, you know...  That one day, I love The Proposal with Sandra Bullock.  That's really good.  No.  Yeah, it's really good.  I saw it three times so far.  I saw the preview.  It looks like a chick flick.  It is.  That's really, really good.  That's a good chick flick.  Really good.  You can't judge by Roland.  He jerked off to the woodsman.  Thanks, Hans.  I saw that. 
[03:37:00]  Do you know what movie...  Why is that labeled Opie and Anthony?  You want to sit on my lap?  That guy was great, Kevin Bacon.  Yeah, we brought this video to the masses.  I know it was out there, but it's on the Opie and Anthony YouTube channel, I guess.  No, I don't know.  I mean, the audio might be you guys talking about it.  Who the fuck doesn't give this video five stars?  What's wrong with you?  Maybe because she didn't suck it up.  Because it's blurred out.  Maybe because of the blur?  But it got over a million views.  I could swear.  After we brought it to our show. 
[03:37:30]  All right, we got to go.  That's right.  All right.  I'll be on Red Eye tonight.  That's fucking right.  So if you want to watch Red Eye.  Tell the boys I said hi down there to Red Eye.  They all know me.  Jimmy on Red Eye tonight.  I'm sure the boys know.  All right.  And it says hi?  Yes.  I like it.  We're just going to putter out today?  Yeah.  We're just going to peter out.  Why not? 
[03:38:00]  We got a goddamn business meeting.  Is it putter or peter out?  We got business.  Spider or peter?  We got business to tend to.  Business.  All right.  We just.  That's how it ends today.  That's what we do.  Are they going to listen to us put our coats on?  Why not?  We're going to break, Travis.  Jesus.  I'm not. </pre>
