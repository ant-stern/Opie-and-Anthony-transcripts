<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts joking about their lack of preparation after two days spent struggling with a metal ring puzzle.  They then discussed a disappointing meeting with a Rockstar Games representative, lamenting their failure to secure advanced game copies.  The show quickly shifted to a heated feud between Opie and Al Dukes, a producer for Ron and Fez. Opie detailed his intense dislike for Al, stemming from a drunken incident where Al allegedly broke Opie's foosball table.  This animosity escalated after Al gifted Opie a supposedly $3,000 pinball machine, which Opie refused to accept. Al's response, including a parody song about the situation, further enraged Opie.  Fez called in to offer his perspective and solutions, including confining Al to the mailroom.  The discussion included various opinions on how to resolve the conflict,  including the eventual destruction of the pinball machine, contingent on Ron Bennington's approval; numerous callers offered their suggestions.  The true value of the pinball machine was later revealed to be far less than initially claimed.

The broadcast also included a discussion about a bizarre anti-violence Olympic PSA and a rant by Opie about a lawyer defending an Arab-American Secret Service agent denied boarding on an American Airlines flight. Opie used offensive language and ethnic slurs to express his frustration with what he saw as preferential treatment and political correctness.

A significant portion of the show focused on post-9/11 security and the legal defense of suspected terrorists, particularly the role of Jewish lawyers. The hosts expressed strong opinions on the need for strict security measures and their frustration with the legal system's perceived leniency towards suspected terrorists, mentioning John Walker Lindh and playing a Donald Rumsfeld clip. This discussion sparked a heated exchange with a caller who challenged their comments.  The hosts also vehemently criticized their Chicago affiliate for heavy censorship, including removing segments and airing the show in an unfavorable time slot; Chicago listeners called in to corroborate their complaints.  The Al Dukes/pinball machine saga continued throughout, with Opieâ€™s intent to destroy the machine on air remaining a central theme.

Comedian Pablo Francisco was a guest throughout much of the show. His appearance included comedic bits, impersonations, and jokes about various ethnic groups.  His time on the show included a discussion about a performance for Jewish teenagers resulting in a youth director's firing.  Al Dukes recounted an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile with Opie.  The show also featured a sexually suggestive and potentially fabricated phone call from a woman named Crystal claiming her boyfriend cheated, and a long segment focused on guessing the name of a band Crystal was in at age 13 (eventually revealed to be Scarhead), fueled by increasingly desperate pleas from the hosts and various incentives offered. Gary's failed attempt to take a 12-year-old boy and his 12-year-old Puerto Rican girlfriend to an Islanders game was also a topic, leading to crude and sexually suggestive humor.  The show's overall tone was highly confrontational and featured significant use of offensive language.  Ron and Fez joined the broadcast later, contributing to the discussions, particularly the Al Dukes situation. The broadcast concluded with Opie actually destroying the pinball machine with a sledgehammer to Al's distress; the reaction and aftermath of this destruction dominated the final portion of the show.

[00:01:00]  Never be your boogie bag.  Hi.  But those misfortunate like retard, snake, or key.  Uh-oh.  The most offensive show in local radio history.  Yeah.  The Poopoo Platters, Anthony.  Is that who did that?  Poopooplatters.com.  What a great little tune for our show.  The guys have been sending us songs for many, many months, and they finally hit on one.  Yeah.  Of course, they're riffing on the fact that we were voted most offensive radio show in Buffalo history. 
[00:01:30]  Well, uh, was it really a vote?  It was one man's opinion.  Oh, yeah.  But that's great.  I like that tune.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call.  866-2774.  Wow.  That's 866-277-4.  Wow.  What's going on, Ant? 
[00:02:00]  Not too much, man.  I guess we've got to confess that, uh, after two days of really working really, really hard on our syndicated radio show.  Yeah.  Fresh back from vacation.  Fresh back from vacation.  Feeding off that energy.  Yeah.  Had two weeks of, uh, material to feed off of.  Oh, yeah.  We have nothing today.  Yeah, we didn't really, uh, do much show prep.  Our streak has been broken.  Which means we're going to have a great show today.  Trust me.  Two days?  Two days.  Not bad.  New record for us. 
[00:02:30]  We were focused and we were concentrating for two straight days.  Yeah.  Um, we spent like the last three hours trying to figure out one of those stupid puzzles.  That's the problem.  Ah!  Oh.  Hope I didn't get any on you, Sarge.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, the problem is we were in the office and, uh, and, uh, we were trying to do one of those metal ring puzzles where it looks very impossible.  There's a metal ring on some kind of other twisted metal parts and, uh, it does not come off. 
[00:03:00]  The metal ring cannot come off.  But if you, you bend it in certain directions and twist and turn and then all of a sudden, oh, the ring falls off.  Twist, turn and jingle it a little bit and also, yeah, the metal ring falls off and you look like a hero.  This one, impossible.  Impossible.  No way.  I'm an idiot, though.  Yeah, you, you, uh, I, I bought the little puzzle for, uh, Jeremy. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You know, because he has another little puzzle thing on his desk that we all have mastered.  He's got the little puzzles in there, sure.  He has a, uh, what is it, a little metal ball type thing.  Mm-hmm.  And it's made of, like, five pieces and then you have to put it back together.  Yeah.  Kind of challenging.  But at this point, everyone has figured it out, so I figured he needed a new puzzle to drive everyone nuts.  So I bought him this thing.  And Mary got it right back there.  Yeah, this thing, right?  This, this.  No, no, stop it.  Don't, don't. 
[00:04:00]  This thing's driving us nuts.  Hey, wait.  Oh, my God, he just threw it at Rick's head.  I didn't throw it at your head.  You threw it at Rick's head.  I threw it over his head.  He had a duck.  What?  He had a duck.  I had a duck.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Oh, did there were other things?  Give me that.  Did the other thing kind of swing you around?  Give me that, Mary.  I'm sorry.  It was like some kind of a wacky Australian kangaroo killing weapon.  Yeah, because I thought I aimed it perfectly over his head, but then the thing dropped,  but then it spun nicely over your head.  I'm sorry.  It didn't spin nicely over his head.  He ducked it.  Yeah, this is really hard. 
[00:04:30]  I was on the websites trying to find the solution for it.  I can't even find this puzzle.  I think they just put it on.  I think they twisted it up, and there's no real solution to it.  Yeah, there's a solution, though.  My brother's really good at those.  And when you find out, it's going to be, oh, my God, it was that easy?  Well, we've tried every combination, haven't we?  How many rings are on there?  There's the circle ring, obviously, and then there's one.  There's the circle ring that has to come off.  Then there is two things kind of bent together like a... 
[00:05:00]  This thing looks like a big horse bit, like a giant horse bit that goes in the horse's mouth.  Snaffle bit if you're an equestrian.  And the ring is on the part that would go in the horse's mouth.  And the two rings that would be just outside the horse's mouth are too big for the rings to slide over.  And there's no goddamn solution! 
[00:05:30]  And this is what our show prep was all morning.  All morning.  He was trying to do this.  Well, we interrupted our show prep trying to figure out this puzzle to meet with the fine folks at Rockstar Games.  The fine folk.  Oh, yeah, it was one guy.  They only sent one guy.  I think they sent, like, the black girl of the company.  You know, nice...  I don't know if...  I don't think the guy does anything.  Nice enough guy.  I swear.  He showed us...  Max Payne?  The PlayStation 2 version of Max Payne.  Looked really cool, right?  The blood looks great.  The movement, the graphics, very, very good.  But when we left the meeting, I'm like, where were the guys like developers and... 
[00:06:00]  You know, all the guys...  It's like if they wanted Opie and Anthony to show up in an appearance and Earl showed up.  Yeah.  It was the Earl of Rockstar.  And, you know, we were hoping they were going to slide us some of those, you know, state of emergency discs, even though they're not out yet.  Maybe an advanced copy would have been nice.  I understand.  Maybe an alternate version, wink, wink, nudge, nudge of Grand Theft Auto 3.  I know they're out there.  Where they're real naked hookers and...  Yeah, we're all...  Some real banging going on and... 
[00:06:30]  Nothing.  But it was still fun to meet one of the guys from Rockstar, I guess.  Anyway, so I gave Jeremy that puzzle that you have in your hand and you're about to throw.  I know.  I know you will.  And I ripped up the solution.  Yeah, you...  Right in front of him.  You were very dramatic, I guess.  You ripped it up in front of him.  Well, it's a whole big thing with like, here, now you have to solve it on your own.  No, my brother, you've got to solve this on your own.  Well, can I explain? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Because you get one of these puzzles and you've got the solution in your drawer, let's say, okay?  Uh-huh.  You'll give it the old college try.  You'll try a few days, right?  And then you're going to get frustrated and pissed off.  Open up your drawer and figure out how it's done.  The old college try.  Put some elbow grease into it.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, God damn this thing.  What would...  And I go, I've got to look it up on the web.  Opie, what's it called?  He goes, Uncle Cracker with a K.  I go, this is the Uncle Cracker? 
[00:07:30]  He's like, yeah, Uncle Cracker with a K.  I put it in.  There's a band, Uncle Cracker, which...  No, we all know Uncle Cracker.  I know.  I thought that was the name of the puzzle company.  Uncle something.  Maybe it's not Cracker.  The problem with these are there are so many of them and so many little companies that just turn these things out  that this might just be a variation on a different one.  I can't.  I can't deal with this.  Well, there it is.  Why don't we give it back to Jeremy so we can at least do a radio show?  Yeah, please. 
[00:08:00]  We'll just pass it around the whole show.  It'll suck.  Let's go to the phones here.  What the F is wrong with the phones today?  What's the matter?  Uh-oh.  New York's over there.  National's over here.  Oh, boy.  That's the problem today.  I can see the wires are crossed back there.  That's the problem today.  Who did that?  That's a brand new little glitch, isn't it?  Yes.  Who would have done something so absurd? 
[00:08:30]  I wanted to make believe we were taking calls off the cuff and just casually going to a guy  and knowing exactly what he was going to say.  Right.  But if I went to the National instead of New York, then it would have been a cold call.  Oh, my God.  I don't think we could handle a cold call.  Ben's freaking me out with all the phone cords.  It's like another puzzle.  He's taking the receiver off.  He's trying to wind it around the cord behind it.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  We're back to normal now.  Hugh Johnson, I decided it was easier to cross the phone lines.  Okay.  Now, New York is where it's supposed to be and National is where it's supposed to be. 
[00:09:00]  There you go.  So now if I plunk down and say hi to Dan, he'll be there.  Dan, what's up?  Good afternoon, Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Hello.  Opie, how are you doing this afternoon?  I'm doing good.  You know, after last night's complete mental breakdown that you had on the phone, where  I thought you were going to just completely lose it and drive into an Embuckman.  Well, yeah.  An Embuckman?  I'm being stalked by a fag, basically.  And I don't like it. 
[00:09:30]  I don't like it.  Al Dukes, it seems, has something for Opie, and I don't know what it is.  I'm a kook magnet, I swear to God.  I have more kooks that follow me around than I care to think about.  And one of them works for Ron and Fez, the show that's on after us here in New York.  He's their producer.  Well, that's what they call him.  I don't know what he produces.  It's a cute little title.  Ow!  Wow.  So, it's a known fact for everyone in the New York area that I just despise this guy. 
[00:10:00]  I don't like him.  It's no radio bit.  Anthony will vouch for me.  I haven't said hi to him in...  I don't think I've ever said hi to him officially.  No, I don't think so.  He's very upset about this.  He's trying to win your love and buy your love now with things like a $3,000 pinball machine.  And what put it over the edge was when Ron and Fez had him kiss a guy, and then he made believe it wasn't a guy, I guess, or something. 
[00:10:30]  He got all drunk, and, yeah, somehow he ended up kissing a man on Ron and Fez's show.  He got so upset about this that he went outside and tipped over my foosball table I brought in and broke it.  He was acting like an 11-year-old girl.  And that put it over the top for me.  I'm like, you know, I don't have time for anyone like that.  You know what he was?  He was acting...  Destroyed, you know, personal property of yours.  Yeah.  He was acting like a straight guy that can't accept the fact that he's gay and, like, has his gay experience and freaks out. 
[00:11:00]  He kissed that guy and lost his mind.  Started flipping over my foosball table.  Broke it.  So I was like, you're going to replace that goddamn thing.  That's one of the many soap operas that is the O.P. and Anthony show.  So he finally replaced it after...  I had a threaten.  I had a threaten giving out his phone number on the air.  That's pretty much what it was.  You'd have been able to call Al Dukes at his home at 2, 3, 4 in the morning. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Whatever time you're damn well pleased.  You know that phone would have rang 24 hours a day.  And he finally came to and got the foosball table.  Well, he got the wrong one at first, then he got the right one.  Yeah, then he got the right one.  And so then everything went back to normal, and Ant decided he would at least acknowledge him.  And that's fine.  If he walks by in the hall, they go, how you doing?  Yeah.  That's about all you...  How you doing?  You'll give him, right?  Yeah.  I just don't want to talk to the guy.  Not going to be taking warm showers together.  And I know I look like a complete A, because I've read the email today.  I know.  But I don't like the guy. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  You come across people in your life that you just don't like.  And I said it on the air with Ron and Fez last night.  I honestly couldn't tell you why I don't like him.  I just know I don't.  Right.  And I have no time for him, and I don't want to be bothered by him.  Okay?  And I also told him that I wouldn't punch him in the face, and just leave me alone, and  I'll leave you alone.  He doesn't like the fact that we'll be walking down the hall, and it'll be just me and him  walking toward each other.  Ah, I heard this.  And then it's very uncomfortable.  Not for me. 
[00:12:30]  I love that.  Yeah.  But I guess it's really uncomfortable for him, because he knows I'm not even going to make  eye contact.  You're the only people in the hall.  Nothing.  I do make eye contact out of the side of my eye, though.  And I see him awkwardly trying to nod and stuff, and then the look on his face when he realizes  that I haven't even acknowledged him.  Oh, I know.  He hates that.  And I know I'm in a hole for doing this stuff, and you can write as much as you want, but  I just love stuff like this.  But I said, look, you know, it's a little uncomfortable, but just stay out of my way. 
[00:13:00]  That's it.  I'm not going to even cause a scene in the halls or anything.  Just leave me alone.  So I guess everything kind of went back to normal.  Uh-huh.  And we get back from Christmas break, and yesterday, Ben's telling me that he bought  me a present.  A present.  Anthony, how long have you and I known each other?  Oh, my God.  About eight years now, I believe.  Eight years.  Eight years, yeah.  I think one Christmas.  I've got to remember.  The first one, I think.  One Christmas, I think we bought each other something.  And it was something stupid, like a computer game you wanted. 
[00:13:30]  And I think you bought me, like, a Nirvana CD or something.  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  Some kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Right?  Is that about it?  That's pretty much it.  And with all the success we've had in recent years, you would think maybe...  We'd cut each other off.  Yeah, you'd think maybe we would have done something for each other.  But no, we're just pals and friends.  But we don't need to buy each other things, right?  I know if you want something, you'll buy it.  If I want something, I buy it for myself.  What the hell am I going to get you?  So I go to Ben yesterday.  So what the hell did this idiot buy me? 
[00:14:00]  He goes, a $3,000 pinball machine?  Now, you're thinking he wants to make the piece or something.  He's going to buy you maybe a bottle of wine.  If he hears the show, he knows he likes the wine a little bit.  Maybe a bottle of wine or something.  Maybe, yeah, a video game or something.  I don't do well when people buy me presents.  I think you know that by now if you've been listening to this show.  But I mean, that would even be well over, above and beyond the situation at hand.  Right.  A $3,000 classic Rolling Stones pinball machine. 
[00:14:30]  Which, by the way, is already broken.  Of which they only made how many?  A thousand, I think.  A thousand, yeah.  Well, the thing's already broken, according to Ben.  So I said I wasn't going to...  What?  Rick just said a $3,000 pinball machine is a gay engagement ring.  That's the equivalent of a gay engagement ring.  You didn't accept it, dude.  Oh, yes.  Al Dukes.  Am I married now?  Jesus Christ.  In some countries. 
[00:15:00]  No, it's as good you didn't accept it, dude.  Oh, all right.  So I said I'm not playing the thing.  And then I guess Ron and Fez started...  Can we get Ron or Fez on the phone?  Maybe.  They're around.  They listen to the show.  They'll call in.  So I told...  You know, they went on their show to talk about the whole thing.  Yeah.  And what Al was thinking.  Because now Ron and Fez are embarrassed.  Because, you know, we really get along with Ron and Fez.  But there's this thing between us.  His name is Al Dukes.  Al Dukes.  All I heard was Ronnie last night going,  Ah, this is embarrassing, Fezzy. 
[00:15:30]  Ah, this is so embarrassing.  I hope he's on the phone again.  Ah, this is embarrassing.  This is what I did.  So we got off the air yesterday.  And I'm driving to the Coliseum for the Islanders game last night.  Big win for the boys.  And I hear Ron and Fez talking to Al about it.  And he's crying like a little girl because I haven't accepted his gift.  Yeah, he didn't go up.  I guess he probably had it all planned out in his head.  He's going to present this $3,000 pinball machine.  You're going to go,  Ah, Al, you know, put your hand out. 
[00:16:00]  Nice firm handshake.  Al, thanks, man.  Hey, anything that happened in the past, you know,  I really appreciate this pinball machine.  And thank you so much.  And, you know, I just want to be able to call you a friend now.  It's probably what he played out in his head.  But now it's even more embarrassing.  It's even more uncomfortable.  I'm thinking, why does this guy care this much about, you know, me?  You know?  He could have a career without me.  He could work here without me. 
[00:16:30]  No, he needs your acceptance, your approval, and dare I say, your love.  So I was on the air on the way to the game with Ron and Fez,  the whole ride to the Coliseum.  Yeah.  And Al's trying to talk to me, and I'm like, no.  You can talk to Ron, and Ron will tell me what you're saying.  Ron's the go-between.  I was acting like I was in third grade.  The listener hated that man, the email.  What a toolhole, if you heard ass.  Don't talk to me. 
[00:17:00]  And so then I have to turn off the show because I'm going into the game.  And the game's over.  Islanders win.  I come out to my car.  I listen to Ron and Fez when I'm, you know, tooling around town.  And all of a sudden, I swear, as I turn on the radio,  I hear Al Duke singing a song to me.  Wait, stop it.  Do we have a copy of the...  Stop it.  Do we have a copy of the Painted Black song he was singing last night?  Dude, stop it.  Where is that?  I swear to you, I have not heard this. 
[00:17:30]  You didn't hear it?  I got to hear it, though, now.  So now he's singing, like, a stupid parody song about the whole incident, right?  So then Sandy, my girlfriend, calls in.  Like, look, man, he's got enough stalkers in his life.  I have to deal with Stalker Patty, which is the guy's eyes, dude.  I got to deal with some wacko from Chicago that decides to call us in the middle of the night.  Enough.  Enough.  I don't need another stalker around, right?  So then he goes, and this is what really freaked me out.  He goes, so what is Opie like off the air? 
[00:18:00]  He goes, oh, he wants to get to know you a little more.  And I'm listening to this while I'm driving.  Where is Norton?  I don't know.  Is he coming in today?  I don't know.  I put a call on him.  He's irresponsible.  Getting rid of the evidence.  Getting rid of the evidence.  He's got to wipe off fingerprints, do things like that.  Clean up the blood.  He's got to drive through Staten Island today.  So he's asking Sandy what I'm like off the air. 
[00:18:30]  He needs to know more personal information.  He wants to know.  That really, no joke, dude, that really freaked me out.  And now I will have nothing to do with him.  And he's got to leave me alone.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have Steve from FoundryMusic.com walk me up and down the hall now.  Oh, is that it?  That's how bad it's gotten.  So I completely lost it.  Started screaming.  I told him to leave me the F alone.  Right.  Know what I'm thinking, Ant?  What?  Mail room. 
[00:19:00]  No, the old Carol Miller set up.  Mail room.  Mail room.  Well, every night when we get off the air here, right outside the door is Al Dukes and the rest of Ron and Fez people coming in to set up for their show.  So you want Al Dukes to sit in the mail room.  I want to go back to the mail room.  Until you pass by the mail room on your way to our office.  How well did that work last time we had a problem?  We never had to see or speak to Carol Miller. 
[00:19:30]  That's true.  It did work well.  Well, if he thinks in some way, shape, or form it makes you happy, I'm sure he'd do it.  Well, that's why I want to get Ron and Fez on the line, because I don't want to make them more uncomfortable than they already are.  But I want to set up the mail room thing, without a doubt.  Everyone knows when we walk back down to our office, and he can just wait.  Wait in the mail room.  Or wait in Ron and Fez's office.  As soon as he sees us pass by, then he can come out. 
[00:20:00]  Anthony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, Opie, you've got to do me a favor.  You've got to take the wiffle ball bat challenge bat and smash the crap out of the pinball machine.  You know what?  I think I might take the Jeremy puzzle.  How about the dildo?  What the hell's the name of the guy that we fixed?  Get rid of two things at once.  Look at Ben's freaking out.  Ben really likes that pinball game.  It's broken already, you said.  What's wrong with it?  You've got to smash it to pieces.  Wait, wait.  What happened, Anthony?  It's not like completely screwed, but if the ball goes on like the left side of the two bumpers, 
[00:20:30]  it will go into the hole, but if you play on the right side, you understand what I'm saying?  What do you mean it'll go into the hole?  There's like one thing bent somehow.  I don't know.  I guess it happened last night.  Everyone's blaming Earl for it, but I don't know.  How the hell do you bend something inside a pinball machine?  I'll tell you why.  Because the machine's not worth $3,000.  It's a piece of crap machine, and he's trying to make himself feel even better than he is.  Fez is on the line here, I believe.  Fezzy!  I am so embarrassed. 
[00:21:00]  I'm just humiliated.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was quite the conversation.  But, you know, if you keep talking about the pinball machine and things being bent and going  into the hole, you're just going to turn him on more.  Yeah, I don't get what's going on with him.  I was listening last night, and I could barely listen.  It was very embarrassing.  I could barely listen, and I was on the show.  Why does he care so much about my stupid life?  He's obsessed. 
[00:21:30]  Why?  What have I done?  Is it a thing, maybe, where it's one of those guys where everyone has to like him?  It's either that, or it doesn't matter that everyone else either likes or tolerates him.  It's the one that he can't get.  Right.  That's the one you want, always.  That's most important to him.  See, everyone else doesn't care about him, just kind of, you know, like I even go, he  said last night, I even, if I see him in the hall, I now go, hey, what's up?  And I walk by.  So that's fine. 
[00:22:00]  But the one person here that does not acknowledge him is the one he needs approval from the most.  Opie has become the great white whale to him.  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  And he wants the Moby Dick.  Moby Dick.  That was, that got so weird at the end of the show yesterday, Fezzy.  It was just bizarre.  And I thought, you know, it's another Stalker Patty situation.  Opie's going to lose his voice.  It's going to be our fault because he's just screaming, stop it at Al.  I was screaming, stop it.  My cell phone was crapping out.  I was getting so pissed off last night. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, Fez, would this be acceptable now, Opie's idea of leaving Al Dukes maybe in your office  until we pass by?  I say mail-roam him.  Mail-roam him now.  All right.  You know what?  He'll actually be thrilled because he's going to think it's mail, M-A-L-E.  Oh, well, that's true.  You know, because now, you know, he's going to probably show up in the next hour or two  and it's going to be, now it's going to be, now I'm going to be uncomfortable.  I'm surprised you didn't come to work today to an office full of flowers. 
[00:23:00]  Because now I'm going to think the guy's in love with me.  Think.  Dude, the guy, you know, and don't get mad or anything.  Because this is no reflection on you or your sexuality or anything.  We all know you've had a girlfriend for many years.  Everything's fine.  So believe me, it's no reflection on you.  I have a fiance in Niagara Falls.  I care you, Canada.  Of course you do, Fezzy, yes.  And I care it up, man.  Yeah, yeah.  We have hot sex.  Yeah, sure you do.  Yeah, yeah.  But Al Dukes is in love with you. 
[00:23:30]  He is in love with you.  In some way, shape, or form.  I don't know if that's fantasies of some kind of sex or if it's just like a cuddling, nuzzling thing.  There is a love that this man has for you.  It's a male crush, Oak.  Oh, you know, that means only one thing.  Get the sledgehammer.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Do you really think that, Ant?  If you think that... 
[00:24:00]  Dude, I seriously think that.  And I'm not even kidding.  Get me the sledgehammer.  I'm not even kidding.  Opie, seriously, if we analyze it, look at the gift he gave you.  Yeah.  A Rolling Stones pinball machine.  You have to play the thing.  You have to stare at Mick Jagger's junk to play it.  Yeah.  And they made it extra large on this machine for whatever reason.  And, you know, you just look up and there it is.  You don't have to search it out.  Trust me.  I thought it was the third flipper.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, where's that Rolling Stones song he sang? 
[00:24:30]  I got it.  You know what?  I know you don't want to talk to Al Dukes to get it.  I got it.  Rory Hamptons would have it.  I think Rick's got it.  Rick's got it.  Great.  Great.  If A works today, then we got it because it's not B.  Definitely it.  This is it?  Is it ready to play or you got it kind of?  Ready to play.  All right.  Hold on, Fezzy.  I can't wait.  I got to make sure you get to hear this, too.  So this is, I get out of the Islander game.  Fezzy, I swear to God, I was convinced you guys talked about this for four straight hours  last night.  I swear to you, we didn't. 
[00:25:00]  I turned off the show and you guys are still talking.  The Islanders win.  Then I get back in my car.  And now I have him singing to me while I'm trying to get home.  Here it is.  Ope hates the new machine.  I have to take it back.  Oh, my God.  Called me a closet bag.  I have to take it back.  I screwed with the biggest show. 
[00:25:30]  It's called Career Suicide.  Oh.  Ope doesn't want a thing from me.  He wants a piece of my hide.  No, I don't.  Ope still won't say hello.  I have to take it back.  Ope just wants me to go and take the machine back.  I tried to buy new friends.  I tried to show some class.  I further burned the bridge. 
[00:26:00]  I'm such a stupid ass.  Oh.  And that's it.  Oh, my God.  And that's it.  You want a piece of his hide.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  I'm so embarrassed I'm listening under a blanket.  Yeah.  Isn't that awful?  Put his pants on.  Yeesh.  We definitely have a problem around here.  Just when the station started to feel cool, we have a problem.  Yep. 
[00:26:30]  Let's try the mailroom solution first.  Then the sledgehammer.  No, I need sledgehammer today.  Oh.  No, no.  I need sledgehammer today, and I need the Ron approval, and I need the Fez approval.  Do I have at least the Fez approval, and then I'll wait for the Ron approval?  You know what?  After what you went through last night, I'll sign anything you want.  Oh.  Fez approval.  Just waiting for Ron to give his approval.  Oh, no.  Get the sledgehammer.  Oh, no, no.  If Ann thinks he is in love with me, this will solve it. 
[00:27:00]  Where is it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Just waiting for Ronnie.  And then just leave the pieces on Al's desk.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Look, how much did he spend on this?  $3,000, he claims.  I cannot be smart.  I have never gotten a gift over $200 in my life.  That's why I was wondering if today you got there and there was a mink or something.  Yeah, that's like a, that's a present that, uh...  Hey, talk to Fez for a sec.  I got it.  I just want to size up. 
[00:27:30]  If the sledgehammer will be better...  Or the baseball bat.  Yeah, I just got to say, a $3,000 gift is something that, if you are in a great relationship with somebody, you would get them that if you're doing very well.  I mean, the Kennedys don't exchange gifts like that.  What is he doing?  He's sizing up.  Oh, my God.  He's sizing up.  Hold on.  I got to get on another mic.  Just two seconds.  Let me, uh...  Let me get over here.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Let me get on this mic over here.  Is this one on? 
[00:28:00]  Hello.  There we go.  I'm just sizing it up.  Oh, you're sizing up.  Damn, you scared the crap out of me.  You scared the crap out of me.  Dude, I, I, I've been in this business a long time.  If I'm smashing this, it's going to be after commercials.  Hey, uh...  All right, so I got your approval.  If Ron gives the approval, it's done.  Done deal.  All right, you're halfway there.  Look at Opie going to the, uh, people.  It's like, it's like a hit has to go down.  You got to go through the proper channels or else you'll get whacked yourself. 
[00:28:30]  I'm showing respect to the Ron and Fez family.  That is.  Showing a little respect.  Appreciate it.  Where the hell's Ronnie today?  I have no idea where Ron is.  Contrary to popular belief, we do not share an apartment.  Well, could you try to get him on the line?  I will look for Ronnie.  This needs to be done today.  Thank you, Fez.  All right, bro.  All right.  There he goes, Fezzy.  By the way, sledgehammer.  Wow.  That's what I thought.  And Ben's going to be really bummed.  We'll get our own pinball machine. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, boy.  I don't need, I don't need someone from, uh, Ron and Fez's show buying us a pinball machine.  Oh, my God.  Do one better, sell it and keep cash.  It is probably.  It is a collector's eye.  And they said it on Ron and Fez's show last night.  Oh, no.  Put it up on eBay.  Take the cash.  We got to take a break.  Do we have those, uh, science goggles still?  I'm freaking out.  Okay, good.  Because I know, you know something, I know you too well.  You better set up the mice because as soon as the call comes in from Ron, it's not even, 
[00:29:30]  it's not even a question.  It is just out there.  Get rid of it.  Oh, my God.  That just ain't right.  Just waiting for that hotline to rank.  Oh, no.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  Oh, God.  I'm looking through, um, all types of, uh...  You know Ronnie is fighting his conscience right now. 
[00:30:00]  He's just like...  He's the guy with his finger on the button right now.  He's the godfather now.  I'm waiting for his approval.  I'm, uh, I'm looking at, uh, pinball websites because I, I want...  I want a little confirmation on the, uh, price.  Oh, that's a collector's item?  And on the, uh...  And just ask our listeners.  Someone will come up with a price in a second.  Yeah, but I can't trust them.  I gotta see it myself.  I don't know.  We'll get one of the collectors on the line.  I guarantee you.  We'll get the, we'll get the company that he got it from. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, I know it's a collector's item.  Believe me.  I'm just saying, I don't know how, uh...  I don't know how much, uh, how many they made, what the price is.  He says three grand, and they made a thousand of them.  Oh, that's a good idea.  I'll try that.  Yeah.  Remember this? 
[00:31:00]  Kofi and his sledgehammer.  All right.  Let's put that in.  Classic.  People are like, please, donate it to my bar.  It's not gonna have the same effect. 
[00:31:30]  Currently, uh...  I gotta, I gotta crush his heart.  Right now on eBay, we have $585.  For the same one?  For the same exact one.  And judging by this picture, it is in better condition than the one we have.  Um, 80, 1980 Bally's Rolling Stone Pinball Game.  Outstanding, clean, original condition.  Ready to plug and play without any, uh, necessary repair jobs.  Cabinet very clean.  Shows some wear around flipper buttons. 
[00:32:00]  Colors are bright and not faded out.  Let's see.  All plastic intact.  Everything works.  Hmm.  Okay.  You know, that, dude.  It's $585.  That's it?  Yeah.  Matt Devote says he knows the price.  Oh, Matt hung up.  Let me go to Kevin.  Kevin, where do you work?  Classic pinball.  I own it.  You own this pinball?  Yes.  Is this hope?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  How you doing, man?  All right. 
[00:32:30]  Smashing it's a bad idea.  You better, you better get all your plugs in so you're not pissed at me.  I'm not pissed at you.  Classicpinball.com?  That's me.  And where are you located in Clifton, New Jersey?  We're on Valley Road.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  I was just there yesterday setting it up.  Why is it a bad idea to smash it?  Because it's a nice game.  There's not that many left floating around, although they didn't make only 1,000 of them.  They didn't only make 1,000?  No, they made about 5,700 of them.  Yeah, that guy exaggerates everything.  He's also a liar. 
[00:33:00]  He lies.  He exaggerates.  He's a liar.  And just so you guys know, I'd have brought you a Pac-Man if that's what they told me to bring.  Well, the guy doesn't even know me.  For a stalker, he doesn't do a good job.  And he didn't tell me any of the story either.  There's a friend of mine, Donnie, told me the story when we got in the van to leave there.  He told me the whole thing about what happened with the foosball table.  Yeah.  Now, how much does this thing go for?  Now, the $3,000 number, it's a high number, but they do command that through certain dealers.  They change hands among collectors for $8,000 to $1,500 needing work. 
[00:33:30]  Well, I just saw a mint one for $585.  Well, that's the first bid, don't they?  Yeah, that's probably the first bid on eBay, but that'll go much higher.  No, the first bid was like $400.  Oh, okay.  I think he was looking for five.  Can I let you in on some other little dirt that's going to make you hate Al even more?  Yeah.  All right.  He didn't buy that from me.  He didn't buy it from you.  He didn't buy that from me.  That's on loan.  If I can take that out and bring you anything you want.  All right.  He didn't tell me any of the scoop.  He just said, you know, we just want to put a game in here, you know, and we'll plug you on the air. 
[00:34:00]  And, oh, is that it?  He traded?  Borrowing the game for plugs?  Yeah.  Cut me off.  Hello?  Yeah, yeah.  You got a call waiting.  No, sorry about that.  All your friends are calling.  Dude, you're on the radio.  I'm listening to you.  Holy ass.  I was just getting ready to head out to go look at some stuff at a guy's house, and we heard you talking about it.  So I said, uh-oh, they're going to be calling.  So it's ClassicPinball.com.  Right.  All right.  We mentioned you twice, times 2,000. 
[00:34:30]  That's $4,000 worth of advertising right there.  Okay.  Well, go smash it then.  Oh, God.  Well, you know what you should do?  Instead of smashing it, you know, think up a good way to give it away or something.  Oh, that's hokey radio.  I've got to break this kid's heart.  How about if I bring you something else to smash?  No, you're going to bring us something else nice.  Bring you something else nice.  Didn't you see me there?  You said I was the guy with the Jets jacket.  I think you need to come out and console me.  Oh, you were...  Okay.  Do you have, like, a Galaga or a Ms. Pac-Man?  Yes. 
[00:35:00]  See, we want that.  We had that already, though.  It got repossessed.  You didn't have nothing except a bench foosball table.  We need the game that they got up at BCN in Boston.  You want the combo, the Ms. Pac-Man-Galaga.  It has, like, 30 games.  No, this has 30 friggin' games.  Baseball.  It had Asteroids.  It had Pac-Man.  It was, like, 30 games in one.  Yeah, that one rocked.  Is that the Ultra Cade?  Might be.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  Because that has all the different...  There's jam packs in there that have the Namco Classics, the Midway Classics. 
[00:35:30]  No, who would know is Oedipus.  Yeah, he would know.  He loved the game.  Yeah.  He played about 20 out of the 30 while we were there.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Tell me what you want, and we'll get it.  All right.  Hold on a while and talk to Rick, okay?  Okay.  I'm just waiting for Ronnie to call, Ant.  That's it.  They're not sure if they're going to be able to find Ron.  Why?  I was just talking to Rory.  They said he's out all day.  We're not sure when we're going to hear from him.  Out all day?  What does a Ron do during the day?  I don't know.  Before the program.  But I was also thinking, oh, maybe you should be able to put your assistant PD hat on again. 
[00:36:00]  Because...  So what this guy's saying is Al is using the station's airtime for his own personal game.  Oh, pretty much.  Yeah.  To get in with me.  Mm-hmm.  Trust me, it's not worth it.  Blanket party.  I want to play a little before you smash it.  Well, we'll take a break.  All right.  I'll play a little.  Someone's got to find Ron.  I can't do this without Ron's blessing.  I got Fezzy's blessing.  I am certain Ron will call in before we leave.  Yeah, but that's like a goofy radio tease. 
[00:36:30]  No, no.  I don't want a tease like that either.  I want it to be a medium.  I want it to happen, like, after break.  I want it to happen soon.  Yeah.  So do I.  I'll take the one, you know, radio tease.  But then after that, they're going to be on to us.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Ann.  All right.  So that's where we stand.  Mm-hmm.  Ronnie calls.  Rolling Stone.  Pinball machine is history.  Sledgehammer.  Just leaned up against it right now.  Is it out there? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God, is it?  You're going to use the hammer, not the baseball bat?  Yeah, the baseball bat was too light.  It could snap in half.  Baseball bat's cooler.  It's more mafia.  The sledgehammer's kind of Gallagher.  Get the sledgehammer.  You haven't smashed anything with the sledgehammer yet.  It's always me.  Yeah.  Check out the sledgehammer, the weight on this thing.  I've enjoyed watching the sledgehammer being used.  I like it.  But the sledgehammer's more the Gallagher type thing, 
[00:37:30]  where the baseball bat is more Al Capone.  Yeah, but do I look like the Al Capone type?  I don't know.  Oh, this baseball bat, you could do some...  I know you can with this.  I would...  How about a combo?  I would take out the glass top with the sledgehammer  and then wind up and take out the backboard with the baseball bat.  That's nice.  Nice.  You could smash Mick right in the nads with the bat.  Oh, that's what I'll do.  Yeah.  I'll hit Mick in the ballies with the bat.  With the bat and then the sledgehammer to take out the top 
[00:38:00]  and the workings of the machine.  Yes.  Yeah, right.  You might want to move it away from Pete's equipment.  Yeah.  Because that's going to blow up real nice.  What are you doing to my delay systems that I put in?  All right.  Ronnie, if you're out there, please give us a call.  If anyone knows where Ronnie is, Ron Bennington,  he's got to call the Opie and Anthony show today, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Just waiting for Ron's blessing, Anthony.  Don't be an a-hole. 
[00:38:30]  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go ask yourself, Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Boy!  We will be losing a pinball machine today, hopefully.  Oh, boy.  Just waiting for Ron Bennington's, Bennington's approval.  Collector's item.  Fezzy said yes.  Just waiting for Ron to say yes. 
[00:39:00]  And it's over, Johnny.  Benji, what's up?  Hey, listen, I live in Connecticut.  I'll come down there with my pickup truck.  I'll give you $1,200 cash for it now.  $1,200 will buy a lot of beer, Anthony.  This ain't about the money, right?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, yeah.  You know what you could do?  By the time I probably get down there,  your boy toy will be there,  and I can tell you right in front of him.  That would crush him. 
[00:39:30]  See?  See?  Get Ron on the phone right now.  See?  That's why this has to happen.  That would crush your boy toy.  Don't say boy toy.  Holy ass.  Boy toy.  Ouch.  I will have to say no to the $1,200.  Yeah.  He's listening to himself  because he was so witty for our show today. 
[00:40:00]  Josh, what's going on?  It's Joel.  Joel?  Yeah, I got a deal for you.  I'll give you a Marvel versus Capcom  street fighting machine,  set it up so you could use it for free,  and when you're not there,  you hook it up so that they have to put quarters in it.  No.  That way you make money from now until whenever.  Like Anthony said, it's not about the money.  It's not about money.  Fine, but look, it's a better game.  Something that you'd enjoy using.  Yeah, it's not about the money. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  A lot of people making offers for this thing, Anthony.  It's not about that, right?  Mitch from Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, I saw that pinball machine in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  just a day or two ago.  Oh, yeah?  And they have it up on a little pedestal  and a little light on it and everything.  Hey, how about that?  Hey, I'm a pinball collector myself,  and I'm into the preservation of it,  but don't take any money for it.  Smash that thing.  He's into the preservation of it.  Yeah, but, I mean, smash it. 
[00:41:00]  That's funnier.  Well, we've got to find Ron.  We don't even know where he is.  Hey, I'll tell you the video game you guys want to get,  they've got one where you shoot people  and you duck behind things,  and it's all done with motion sensors.  I think Anthony would really like it.  I don't like any of that crazy mumbo-jumbo.  I like the standard shooter.  All right, Mitch, thank you.  Duck behind stuff.  Hey, you guys are back.  Mitch from Cleveland.  The pinball machine's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, we'll patiently wait for Ron to call in, hopefully. 
[00:41:30]  In the meantime, you were reading a story  just before he went on the air?  Yeah, I think this classifies as a nephew.  First, though, and this kind of has something to do with it,  are we running something about stopping the violence  during the Olympic Games?  I'm getting a lot of instant feedback on this one.  I guess during spots, we run some kind of a,  is it a PSA or is it?  Ron, it's a spot.  It's a spot?  How are we going to stop the violence?  I don't know.  It's something about,  how are you guys carrying commercials  calling for stopping the violence during the games? 
[00:42:00]  What a bunch of tree-hugging liberal bull-ass.  We've got a lot of weird spots like that lately.  Those sales whores can do better than that.  You hear the commercials for Queer as Folk?  Voted number one show by Al Dukes.  Well, Al's now selling ads for the radio station.  He's ordering left and right.  What is that for?  You want to hear a little piece of it?  In 776 B.C., the Greek states of Ellis and Pisa were at war, right? 
[00:42:30]  This was not unusual by any means.  What was unusual was this.  In honor of the forthcoming Olympic Games,  both sides agreed to lay down their arms  and allow participants to pass through enemy territory.  What year?  Unharmed.  7?  776.  Yeah, the countries are listening to us right now, idiot. 
[00:43:00]  If we can stop fighting for 16 days,  maybe we can do it forever.  Celebration of the match.  Holy smoke.  You gotta be kidding me.  What is that?  Who sponsored that?  What is that?  Yeah, it doesn't even...  Olympic Committee. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, it's the Olympic Committee?  That's what it says on the spot.  Dude.  That means nothing.  What the hell's that about?  I don't think anyone stopped bombing during World War II, either,  to tell you the God's honest.  Are you playing that in 100 countries and 100 different languages?  Wow.  What if we go there without our guns and they didn't get the spot on...  And they didn't hear the spot on the Afghani version of the O&A show.  Right.  The Omar and Akbar show.  Wait, I thought it was going to be... 
[00:44:00]  Where is Shaheed our sales girl?  I thought it was going to be friendly, the friendly games.  She will buy anything.  Get her in here so we may beat her with sticks.  That's, that's kind of, that's kind of silly.  That's cute.  Cute.  All right.  Sure, why not?  All right.  That doesn't make, I, I mean, I, I... 
[00:44:30]  All right.  Whatever.  As long as they turn a buck, I guess.  Everything's fine.  I don't need, do they pay for that at least?  Amy, what's up?  That is the wussiest piece of crap ad I have ever heard.  Isn't that just beat me up in the schoolyard kind of quality to it?  First of all, are we at war or are we at stick and nursery school?  Let's burn those guys up.  Is that more wussier than the queerest folk ads we're running?  Wait, what are you thinking of this?  You know, in 7, in 776 during the Olympics, I believe men wrestled naked, too. 
[00:45:00]  I don't want to see that either.  Right.  Yeah, really.  I don't know what the hell, uh...  All right, Amy, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  We're supposed to lay down our arms.  A little, it was a simpler time back then.  I think when they were duking it out back then, it was all about, I want your property.  And we'll play the games, fine, and then I'll get back to just hacking your people in two.  A little more complex these days.  2002.  I don't think we'll be laying down our arms. 
[00:45:30]  But, um, speaking of the, um, our little actions and what we're doing in, uh, Afghanistan and Osama Bin Laden, all that happy horse crap that's going on.  Here is why we are doomed.  We are doomed in this, uh, battle against terrorism.  I like to think that people are going to wake the F up, Anthony.  It ain't going to happen as long as there are lawyers and, and, uh, uh, panty wastes out there. 
[00:46:00]  Who did, who did bodyguard lashes out at airline?  There it is.  Remember, uh, a while back, the Secret Service agent?  He's an Arab-American.  Secret Service agent was denied, uh, boarding and flying on an American Airlines plane because he was armed, uh, and he had some, uh, inconsistencies with his paperwork to bring a weapon on an aircraft.  And believe me, if two airlines should be a little flustered, it's United and American. 
[00:46:30]  And, uh, the pilot said that this guy got a little loud when, uh, his identity was questioned as a Secret Service agent.  And they denied him, uh, that flight.  And then, uh, when everything was checked out, he boarded, uh, another American Airlines flight and continued on his way.  Does it end there, Opie?  Does it ever end there?  Of course not.  No.  A lawyer, a scum-sucking lawyer for the Secret Service agent yesterday accused American Airlines pilot, uh, an American Airlines pilot of kicking the agent off the flight because he's an Arab-American. 
[00:47:00]  Here's why we're doomed.  But the pilot, uh, said he refused to fly the agent because he became loud and abrasive.  The agent, who's a member of Bush's security detail, was booted from the flight.  The only reason why he was not allowed on that plane is because he is an American of Arab descent, said his lawyer, John Relman, probably a self-hating Jew.  Relman sounds like a Jewish name, right? 
[00:47:30]  And he's a lawyer.  How the hell do these Jews take up these, these scumbags' causes?  How do they do that?  What self-respecting Jewish guy would, would defend a son of a bitch like this if it wasn't for the money?  You're busting those stereotypes apart, you scumbag lawyers.  Let him have an Arab lawyer.  Why doesn't he?  He, that doesn't look good in the court.  Looks good if he's got a Jew by his side.  These friggin' Jew lawyers, man, are stupid. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  You're stupid.  All Jew lawyers?  Yes.  You're out of your mind.  Dude, what am I, what do you want me to say?  I'm being completely honest.  There is no self-respecting Jew that should take the cause of defending these animals.  Animals.  That's what I'm saying.  He's a self-hating Jew.  If there's a Jew out there that wouldn't take this case, God bless you.  Pure and simple, this is a case of discrimination. 
[00:48:30]  That's what he's saying.  The agent identified in published reports says,  Waleed Shater is demanding, here it is,  an apology for the airlines and civil rights training for its flight crews.  You know something?  You know, the only civil rights trainings I think pilots need is fly over where two buildings used to be.  If an American Airlines pilot has a doubt in his mind about an Arab getting on your plane, 
[00:49:00]  yes, an Arab, those are the only people so far that have crashed into our buildings.  If an Irishman hijacks a plane, then those effin' Irish bastards shouldn't be allowed on either.  Hey, hey, hey.  What?  Be careful.  I'm just saying that.  We're too busy getting drunk.  We don't have time for something like that.  I understand.  All right, the Italians.  If an Italian gets on a plane and crashes it into our buildings,  any Dago that wants to board a plane should be denied. 
[00:49:30]  But what I'm saying is, this guy was an Arab.  Yes, an Arab-American.  Freaking forget about it.  Hey, forget about it.  Forget about it.  This isn't about civil rights training.  This is about self-preservation.  It's about changing things in time of war and not having to apologize for your actions.  Maybe next time the pilot will have suspicions and think to himself,  you know something, I really need this effin' job.  And if this son of a bitch turns around and takes me to court on some civil rights violation, 
[00:50:00]  I might get fired.  So you know what?  I'm going to let him on.  I'm going to question my better judgment and let this guy on this plane.  And then we're right back to square one again.  We can't worry about offending people.  And this Secret Service agent is a scumbag, too.  He should take the bullet and just go, all right, you know something?  We're in wacky times here.  Sucks to be me.  Sucks to be me right now.  Sucks to be me this time around. 
[00:50:30]  It sure sucked to be the Japs in the 40s when they were putting them in happy little camps out in the desert.  But you know something?  Times change.  We got over it.  We buy you cars.  That's right.  The sushi's good.  The sushi's great.  I love the nail places for the girls and the Yankee Cranky Happy Ending.  You can't beat it.  Ah, those are the Koreans, Anthony.  Them, too.  Then here's another thing from the We Are Doomed portion of this war.  That Moussaoui guy, the accomplice that was supposed to be one of the hijackers, the 20th hijacker, the border guy, arrested. 
[00:51:00]  He's going to stand trial now for conspiracy.  Faces the death penalty on some of these charges.  Thank God.  Him and his lawyer now asking for a televised trial on court TV to assure he gets a fair trial.  He wants the American people, same people he was killing, to now assure him of a fair trial. 
[00:51:30]  And what's his lawyer's name?  I can't find it right here.  You know what this guy's doing?  Just like they used our resources, our American ingenuity and know-how to kill Americans,  Americans, they're now going to use the same stuff to try to get off the hook.  The American press, TV, and our stupid liberal panty-waist emotions.  You know, I would love to watch it on court TV. 
[00:52:00]  I always loved that thing.  The OJ thing was a scream.  It was a hoot.  I liked the trial with the blue dot.  The blue dot trial with the Kennedy rape thing?  Yeah, right.  That was good.  That was a fun one.  But you know something?  No.  I think this should be behind closed doors.  Put them in.  Go in the indoor.  Come out the outdoor in a body bag.  I don't care what happens in the interim.  This, all these guys, all of them, you mark my words, that son of a bitch traitor, that  John Walker guy, when they bring him back, same thing. 
[00:52:30]  They're going to use every resource to save their asses.  And you know what?  We'll buckle under.  Those effing lawyers will twist it around, and they'll make him the poor victimized son  of a bitch, and he'll never see the death penalty.  Thank you.  So I say to you, Americans, never forget what we saw September 11th.  Keep that in mind when these people are being tried.  If it takes years, always remember what happened. 
[00:53:00]  And never, ever get soft on these people.  We can't let political correctness get in the way of justice and our safety in this  country.  If an Arab gets upset because he's denied access to an airplane because of discrepancies,  oh, so be it.  It's the way it's got to be.  That's the time we're living in now.  We have to be inconvenienced as Americans and fear for our lives. 
[00:53:30]  You must be inconvenienced, then, with some more extra scrutiny.  And in closing,  God bless America.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You know, the last person anyone should ask about the whereabouts of any of the senior  Al-Qaeda or Taliban is Don Rumsfeld. 
[00:54:00]  To the extent I had any knowledge, it would be self-defeating for our country and for our  effort for me to even utter any thought about that because it would be a clear indication  that those individuals should stop being where they're being.  So it would be mindless for me to answer a question like that, and I shall not answer a question  like that.  Do you think those reports are credible?  I'm coming to that.  I'm coming to that.  So I have not in the past and I will not in the future answer those questions about their 
[00:54:30]  location.  Anyone who does answer those questions probably either does not know what they're talking  about or, if they do, are violating federal criminal law by providing intelligence information  that it's against the law to provide to people who are not cleared for that intelligence information. 
[00:55:00]  So I really, we're looking for them, we intend to find them, and we intend to capture or kill  them, and that's the best we can do.  Hey, that's nice.  I figured a Rumsfeld clip would be nice there.  I love that Rumsfeld guy.  Some people are a little angry.  Some people agreeing with me, some a little angry.  Well, sure.  John, what's up?  Hey, Anthony. 
[00:55:30]  Hello.  John, first of all, is not a Jewish name.  It's from the Bible.  Okay?  I'm not talking about the John part.  I'm just, you know, whatever.  I've seen plenty.  I was watching CNN the other night, and there is a fine Jewish gentleman lawyer talking about  how he would take up the cause of any of these terrorists, and I could not figure out  why on earth they would do that.  These people hate the Jews and want them dead, yet you would defend them, that the Jewish 
[00:56:00]  people would then defend them.  I just can't understand it.  Dude, second, that guy is Egyptian.  He's not an Arab.  What the hell is Egyptian?  That's Arab.  He's not Arab.  Oh, Egyptian is an Arab gentleman.  So, dude, when you went to opera, you and your girlfriend, you want to tell me you went  to Arab opera?  I heard girlfriend, and that's all I understood.  What happened?  I said when you went, you and your girlfriend to opera, I eat in Manhattan. 
[00:56:30]  You went, you and your girlfriend to Arab opera, or you went to an Egyptian opera?  What?  Arab opera or Egyptian opera.  Oh, Aida?  Yeah.  Oh, I think I understood this guy.  Jesus.  I thought either we were being hijacked or he was talking about Aida.  Yes, sir.  I went to see...  Aida.  Aida.  I don't know about Egyptian or Arab.  It is Egyptian.  I know.  They all wear those things on their head.  What's the big difference between Egyptian and Arab? 
[00:57:00]  Look at the map.  What is Egypt and Africa?  Look, right now, I don't care what nationality they are.  If you're going on the plane with a gun, and you're Arab, Egyptian, or any other part of  that place over there, you have some extra scrutiny you've got to go through.  That's just the way it is.  Sorry.  That guy is seeking a service for God's sake.  What are you expecting?  He had a gun, and he was going on a plane.  I think George Bush should be there to say, he's good.  And even then, it should be questioned. 
[00:57:30]  You know what I'm talking about?  It's the time we live in.  Face it.  God.  We don't face it.  We live in this country.  We know exactly what you're talking about.  But if the guy is seeking a service, have a badge, have an ID, a government ticket.  Hey, I can't be blamed for the fact that your ancestors decided to do something horrible.  The people that are related to your ancestors in some way did something awful. 
[00:58:00]  You know?  So now you're the guys that got to take the brunt of it.  Sorry.  There have been plenty of other races during the history that have had to do the same thing.  We're not talking about violence.  We're talking about just suspicion.  That's it.  Right.  We're a little more suspicious right now.  Okay.  Thank you, John.  West Coast Dave saying he never wants to hear that guy's voice on an airplane.  Ever.  West Coast Dave saying he never wants to hear that guy's voice on an airplane.  What happened?  She's being held hostage?  He was threatening me. 
[00:58:30]  We better take a break.  The phones are lit, though.  We'll go to the next, okay?  And what's going on with Chicago now?  I'm really fast.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys got a problem with the Chicago station out here.  We already know that.  Okay.  Not only do I have to listen to it at, like, 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock at night.  Yeah.  But they're cutting the hell out of your show.  In what way now?  Okay, so...  Well, they have decided what you guys should hear and what you shouldn't hear.  We know that already.  Is that what it is?  Oh, yeah.  Because they replaced the Muhammad Ali bit the other day.  You know, I wanted to listen to his racist vaudeville show. 
[00:59:00]  Well, how did we get to listen to Stalker Patty and her courtship friggin' toenails again?  Wait, hold on.  But how did you...  You're in Chicago right now?  Yeah.  So you heard us do the Muhammad Ali thing live?  I mean, how did...  No, we didn't hear it at all.  We heard you talking about it, going up to it.  And then on What Have We Learned Today, we heard you talking about it.  They cut out the Ali bit?  They cut out the Ali bit.  Those guys are a bunch of douchebags up there.  I swear to God.  Just hearing that bit, Cured AIDS, by the way. 
[00:59:30]  Huh?  It was that good.  Just hearing the bit, Cured AIDS.  They're a bunch of douchebags.  If they don't like the show how it is, then let another station take it.  And you know what?  They'll put it on in a better time slot and we'll kick your ass.  There you go.  Obviously, Chicago will not hear this tonight because they have already decided, oh, we  better not put this on the radio.  Bunch of douchebags.  I swear to God.  They've been editing our show since the beginning.  They admitted it to our boss.  So I know that you're telling the truth, Sean. 
[01:00:00]  Easy, Hope.  You're being insensitive.  Super GM Ken Stevens talked to them up there and they admitted, well, well, we didn't want  to offend this section of our audience.  So we blew off this bit.  They were talking bad about the station.  Of course, we can't have that on our airwaves.  That was funny.  So we took that out.  Did Super GM go with his cape and big S on his chest?  I swear to God, I'm convinced that they got our show in Chicago, threw it on the middle  of the night so we can't compete with them.  Yeah, that's what they did.  Duh. 
[01:00:30]  Of course.  They don't want us on their station, but they don't want us against their station.  Take us off your station.  We'll go on an afternoon drive and we'll kick your ass.  Guaranteed.  Well, all the other afternoon guys out here make sure the O&A show.  Guaranteed.  Yeah, we know it.  We know why they have us on their air.  It's not because they're supporting the show.  You're not supporting the show if you're editing it for your liking.  I hate this business.  I know it's been said before, but I swear to God, it's the truth. 
[01:01:00]  Do they have kryptonite in Chicago?  Maybe Super GM Ken Stevens goes over there and then loses his power when he talks to them?  We're preempted by minor league hockey, sometimes high school basketball.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Bunch of douchebags.  I hope you enjoy editing this out of tonight's program, you asswipe.  I'll edit it.  Yeah, keep looking at the ratings. 
[01:01:30]  Real impressive, aren't they?  Douches.  No wonder.  Thanks, Sean, for the update.  No problem, guys.  You guys suck.  Thank you, man.  Thanks, Jeff, you dick.  Jeff Schwartz, you dick.  You pussy.  Play the goddamn show.  Play it like we do it.  Can't even stick up to your bosses and tell them what's right and what's wrong.  Douche.  You'll be out of a job soon, too.  Ooh.  Is that a threat?  No, it's just, you know, we're weeding out the weak PDs in this business. 
[01:02:00]  You're next, Jeff.  Good job.  Douche.  God.  Take us off the station.  That's all we want.  Why has that been done already?  I know we had spoken about this a while back, and then it was told to us that things were  going to get better or something.  Let me tell you something.  Well, they're not.  Let's go.  Let me tell you something.  The Muhammad Ali bit.  Yeah.  One of the funniest things we've done in months.  It was a lot of fun.  Even we enjoyed it. 
[01:02:30]  In months.  Muhammad Ali telling racial jokes.  Yep.  So we went with it.  20 minutes of hilarious radio.  Yeah.  They have decided, well, you know, this is too edgy for us.  Got to be politically correct.  We'll put it on a station that enjoys that type of thing.  Buffalo likes it.  Most offensive radio show in local history.  That's right.  All the other cities we're on take the show as is.  Yeah.  We'll talk with Super GM and Super Agent. 
[01:03:00]  Crinkle Crinkle, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Yo, I was down in Chicago for Christmas, and I thought you guys were going to play the  homeless shopping spree.  We replayed it Christmas Eve for everybody while we were away.  On Chicago, they had the bit where Anthony was talking about his ex-mother-in-law, and  where Lynch was in the studio.  On Christmas Eve?  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure it was Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  And to top it all off, like, in the funniest parts of Anthony's story, they were just like 
[01:03:30]  cutting off.  Well, we'll confirm all this.  Thank you, Crinkle Crinkle.  Buffalo's got no problem with our show.  Like that.  A lot of places.  Boston doesn't have a problem.  Washington, Philly, Cleveland.  Well, Boston had a little problem.  New Year's Day.  That's what I hear.  I don't know.  People want to hear music instead of us.  All right.  I'm just saying.  I'm not putting Boston in the all-good column right away. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  We're still waiting for Ron to call in.  Mm-hmm.  If he says yes, pinball machine will be destroyed.  Yeah.  And trust me, I know Anne's going to want a few shots now after that rant.  Yes.  We'll be back.  I am Dave.  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  This is Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you are listening.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:04:30]  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Riled up today.  Riled up.  Arr.  A bunch of people riled up.  Michael, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How you doing?  Oh, it's this Michael.  Yeah.  Listen, Anthony, you hit a nail right on the head.  I guarantee you this Walker clown, he's got to come back to this country.  They're not even talking about treason or anything like that.  Next thing you know, he's going to be on all the talk shows.  Yep.  And he's going to write a book.  Book deal. 
[01:05:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, my friend.  Book deal's already rolling in for him.  Yep.  You know, it's ridiculous.  They should take him out, pay-per-view, and hang this guy.  You know what the problem is, is America loves crap like this.  We eat it up.  This is a brand new thing.  This is a brand new type of criminal that we can deal with.  Yeah.  Do I have to start up the patriotic music?  No, no, that's okay.  Go, Anthony.  Go all day long about this.  I was just going to be quick on this one.  It's a brand new type of criminal we got, and the lawyers are loving this. 
[01:05:30]  And that's why I get pissed off at the lawyers that accept these cases, because to them, that's  like a band playing the garden, playing a huge...  It's the big time.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, what they're trying to do is just make the almighty dollar.  He'll be in front of Barbara Woolworth before you know it.  Right.  And the lawyers try in this case, all of a sudden, they're rock stars, man.  They're on TV every day.  This is what they...  It's not so much...  They don't care about defending the Constitution and giving the guy his right to an attorney. 
[01:06:00]  They care that they are now the rock stars of the legal world.  This is what they've been gearing up for their whole life.  Yeah, just real quick.  Did you hear about...  Did you know about our new mayor, Bloomberg?  He was talking about the World Trade Center building yesterday.  Another douchebag.  Already hate the new mayor of New York.  What did he do?  I mean, he was talking about...  You know what he's done to the cops and the firemen already?  Well, not that.  Cutting budgets and taking money out of their pocket already.  Yeah, the guy who runs... 
[01:06:30]  That new guy who's supposed to be running the firemen has no idea what he's doing, first  of all.  Well, that's another thing.  Quickly, for everybody else, Bloomberg appointed the head of the fire department, and the guy  has never been a firefighter.  He's a businessman.  Bloomberg's take on it is, we got people in the fire department that know about the firefighting  aspect.  We need a guy in charge that knows about budgets and management and whatnot.  But I believe in order to know how to divvy up money and whatnot and resources, you got 
[01:07:00]  to kind of know what it takes to fight fires and what kind of equipment you do need.  And if you got a guy at a firehouse saying that he needs such and such equipment, I think  the guy in charge should know what that equipment is, how it's used, had used it before.  I think that makes it a little more effective.  Well, I mean, you know, he's also talking about the World Trade Center and the building.  I mean, they're not going to rebuild it to who it was, and I think they should go right  back to it.  I mean, they're talking it's highly unlikely it's going to happen. 
[01:07:30]  Well, they're figuring, though, that the businesses will not want to go back into that  situation.  That's crap.  I understand.  I do understand that.  Like, right after it happened, we were all kind of rah-rah, let's get 120 stories up,  you know?  Yeah.  But now, first of all, yeah, they wouldn't be able to lease space up there.  It would be a vacant building above 50 floors.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding?  I mean, come on.  Don't you think they're going to go to the extreme now and watch out for that?  Unless Wile E. Coyote wants to buy 50 stories of a building, because that's the only person 
[01:08:00]  that's going to go in that goddamn thing.  Who's going to rent out?  You know, but if you work in the building, you might take a peek above 50 real fast.  A quick elevator ride and a quick back down.  Oh, get me down.  Do you think we'd let it happen again?  We don't have a choice.  We didn't let it happen the first time, my friend.  Yeah, no one has a choice in these things, man.  If someone gets a renegade plane, it's all over again.  Not that it couldn't happen in a 20-story building, but, you know, it's kind of hard, 
[01:08:30]  we've realized, to get people up into those buildings now.  You're not going to see those buildings.  No.  Yeah, but if you see a smaller building, then we're defeated, don't you think?  Well, we lost one, okay?  We took up one in the lost column.  All right.  That means we've got to just kill 10,000 more of them.  Hey, listen, I don't care.  Let's look at the facts.  Even Buster Douglas got lucky.  All right.  Listen, Anthony, I really appreciate the way you're going after that.  But Tyson came back strong after that, and we're coming back strong.  Yeah, that's it.  That's what it is.  You've got to pick your battles, and one of them that we can win at, yeah, sure, 
[01:09:00]  we could build another building that way, but it would kind of be unsafe.  You think Memorial, too, is fitting?  I wouldn't like the whole place to be a memorial.  I think we need the office space in the city.  They're saying that a hell of a lot of office space was taken out.  I hate to say this, but they're talking about four smaller buildings.  Yeah, what I hate to say is, but the land is so valuable that you will not see a memorial there.  No.  Maybe if they can incorporate it into the buildings or something like that, that's fine.  That's pretty cold to say, but that's the facts of it.  It's business, man. 
[01:09:30]  You're right, Opie.  It comes down to business.  You will not see a huge memorial like they did in Oklahoma City.  You're going to see a lot of buildings in that space, and hopefully something that...  I mean, you know, less the fact of me being patriotic, I would rent space there.  I mean, even if the World Trade Center came back, you know, I don't care.  I don't think it'll happen again.  All right.  If they offer you space on the 105th floor, what are you doing?  I'll take it.  Wow.  You're a bigger man than you.  So I'm not trying to be macho, really.  I mean, I do it, because I doubt that we would let the country that we are let this happen again.  Michael, you would never get work done. 
[01:10:00]  You would be looking out that window constantly.  Yeah, the whole time you were there.  I got it.  Just taking a peek.  Huge water slides into the Hudson.  Something happens.  Whee!  Do you hear about the executive parachutes they're selling now?  Yeah.  This is hysterical.  I heard about people that they're buying parachutes.  These small chutes that you strap on, you can jump out a goddamn window and just get down on this parachute.  And get this, though.  Some parachute enthusiasts are saying this is a horrible thing, because most people will just die not knowing how to work the equipment. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, well, at least get a shot at it.  Given the choices, I would rather take my chance with the chute.  Yeah.  But a jet fuel pulling down on you.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare anyway.  I'll take my chances with the chute.  All right, guys.  All right.  Good talking to you.  Take care.  Michael, you rock.  Thanks.  I like what Michael calls.  Erica really upset at Boston.  What's the matter, Erica?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Okay.  I'm a 20-year-old from Boston. 
[01:11:00]  I was listening to you guys a few minutes ago and heard what you were saying about Jews.  Not too liberal.  20-year-old from Boston.  Ho-ho.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So, I was just wondering if you consider yourselves to be patriotic.  Yes, I do.  Sure.  Okay.  So, do you think it's productive to say negative things about a population in the United States,  which is part of this country?  You know what?  Am I saying negative things about all Jews?  The way you were saying it seemed like you pretty much were being pretty anti-Semitic. 
[01:11:30]  I said anti-Semitic.  There you go, because I'm pointing out that there are unscrupulous Jewish lawyers out there  that take up the causes of Eric.  But you know what?  There are unscrupulous Christian lawyers, too.  Yeah, but you know something?  So, why did you differentiate between whether or not they're Jewish?  Erica, because Jews have a special interest in this, that Christian lawyers don't.  They should absolutely not take up the causes of these people that have been trying to eliminate  them, that hate them, that want them dead for years. 
[01:12:00]  Why, then, would you, as a Jewish lawyer, take up these people's causes?  Right.  And so, you can say that maybe you don't think it makes sense, but does that mean that you  should go around saying that they're only doing it for the money and all these other  things?  Well, then why?  They're doing it for money and notoriety.  Period.  Well, I think a lot of lawyers do that, but I don't think there's a reason to make it  into a...  No, there is a reason, because there's a special circumstance with Jewish lawyers, as opposed  to any other lawyer in this circumstance.  Any self-respecting Jewish lawyer should not take up the cause of these terrorists. 
[01:12:30]  I don't think any lawyer should, all right?  I'll say that.  But even more so, the Jewish lawyer should stay away from this.  Well, I understand what you're saying, but I think that the way you talked about it  really is pretty silly, considering that what just happened on September 11th showed  us how much hate there is in the world and how much we don't need to contribute to that  because there's enough.  You know why I'm saying it like that?  Because I'm not thinking about sounding politically correct. 
[01:13:00]  It's not about sounding politically correct.  Yes, it is.  It's about not...  Absolutely.  I mean, it's about not perpetuating Nazism.  I mean, what you were saying sounds like something that you would have heard on the radio 40 years  ago.  See what happens the second you criticize a Jewish lawyer for taking up the cause of an  Arab.  You're automatically now an anti-Semite and akin to Hitler.  Holy Jesus Palomino, Erica.  What are you talking about?  I think if some...  What's your religion? 
[01:13:30]  Me?  I'm pretty much nothing.  Okay, well, if there was something about yourself, whatever your ethnic background is, and people  were going around saying, those damn Polish lawyers, they blah, blah, blah, they're greedy,  whatever, I think you might be a little upset too, and it's not about being politically correct.  If I hadn't opened a mind enough to realize that whatever ethnic background I had was being  hypocritical, I would shut my mouth, is what I'd do.  I'm not responsible for what Jewish lawyers choose to do. 
[01:14:00]  Well, then why are you then defending?  But for you to talk about all Jewish lawyers in a derogatory way, because of what a few  people are doing, it's not right.  Hey, Erica, I said I would shake the hand of a Jewish lawyer that would absolutely turn  these sons of bitches down.  I would shake his hand, pat him on the back, and go, God damn, I can't believe it.  Fantastic.  But you know something?  I'm only seeing the ones on TV that are taking up the causes.  I'm sure they are plenty...  Right, which is a very, very small percentage, isn't it?  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, well, I hope you take that into account next time you...  I am.  I'm calling...  Before you open your mouth to say something. 
[01:14:30]  I'm calling the ones that are accepting the cases, dirtbags.  Thank you, Erica.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, well, there's another 10 minutes of radio that Chicago won't hear tonight.  I didn't even get to call her a twat, and you hung up.  Holy jeez.  She's like, I don't even get to call her a twat, and you hung up.  Yes, Maggie, that's what I said.  Well, hey, Maggie, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  All right.  Like Maggie could repeat it.  Read that back to me, please.  No, I was telling the girls in my office, because we're on a delay.  So I'm hearing everything, and then I'm telling them. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  Hi, I live in New Hampshire.  I live in Portsmouth, and the town next door...  Which town?  Dover.  Dover, sure.  Yeah, in their high school, there were two girls elected best couple.  And there was a big problem with it, and finally, the principal allowed it to happen.  Well, this group of Baptists came from Kansas.  The goddamn Baptists.  Mother effing.  I don't know about the Baptists.  And they are protesting...  I hate Baptists lawyers.  I have no clue about the Baptists. 
[01:15:30]  I don't either.  Are there any Baptists lawyers?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway, yeah, I have my...  So what was the problem?  Two girls were, what, voted prom king and queen or something?  No, no, no.  They were voted best couple.  Best couple.  They were together.  Oh, for the cute yearbook picture?  Yeah.  Okay.  And so this group from Kansas comes down, and they're standing outside the Dover High School  and all over Dover with these signs like, God hates Dover. 
[01:16:00]  They came all the way from Kansas to protest that...  Fags must die, like, all these horrible, like, Matt Shepard must rot in hell for three years.  I...  These horrible people.  I guess they get funded by some church group.  Yeah.  I enjoy the lesbian couples in high school.  Well, I mean, I don't...  Like, I'm not a lesbian, but I mean...  Yeah.  More hate in the name of religion.  More hate in the name of religion.  It's wonderful, isn't it?  I know.  We are doomed as a human race. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  We are.  I completely believe we're doomed.  People worry about...  You remember yesterday, the guy called up and goes,  Someday, the sun is going to get so big, it's going to engulf the earth and then shrink  down to a white dwarf.  And we are all going to die.  We are so going to be gone by then, by our own devices and stupidity,  that it's ridiculous to even have the audacity to believe that we would be around then.  Dude, you're freaking out God, because now lights are going off in here.  God agrees with me.  Shut up. 
[01:17:00]  Well, why are the lights going off?  Not all of them either.  One, two, three, four went out.  I'm right above you.  Erica.  Holy crap.  Stupid Erica.  Stupid Erica.  Ugh.  I enjoy the lesbian couples in the high schools.  Well, there shouldn't be a problem with it.  I saw a little high school lesbian couple walking hand-in-hand at the Roosevelt Mall  when I was there.  Cute, right?  That's cute.  Loved it.  Followed them for ten minutes.  Did they have the little lesbian haircut going?  Did one of them have the short on top, long on the back?  They were the lipstick.  Lipstick lesbos? 
[01:17:30]  Variety, Anthony.  I like that.  I enjoyed it.  It was very nice.  And man, you should see the looks on people that don't get it.  They were horrified.  I followed.  All right, Maggie.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Okay.  You guys are awesome.  Well, we...  Awesome or awful?  What'd she say?  I don't know.  Something like that.  I kind of heard something.  Why isn't Ronnie calling?  Because he doesn't want any part of this, right?  You know something?  It's like I always thought.  Ronnie has a life.  You know what I mean?  He seems to be the only guy around here that you can't get in touch with because he's 
[01:18:00]  probably got a life.  He's got kids and stuff.  This guy's kind of...  I don't know.  He seems like a cool kind of guy that might go out and do stuff.  Not just sit home and play video games like me.  Well, the $3,000 pinball machine that his producer bought for me, for whatever reason  that we've been going over for, I don't know, a day and a half now, will be smashed if  Ronnie gives his approval.  Fezzy said yes.  Yeah, we're just waiting for Ronnie.  What if Ronnie gives us a call?  Fezzy, give us a call and tell us where Ronnie is.  Go ahead, Ange.  It's like someone calling you and going, where's Anthony? 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  Did you try his house?  I don't know what he does after seven.  After that, I have no clue.  No idea.  Yeah, try EverQuest servers.  Hey, can we play another bad sports song?  Ah, you know, when the season winds down, all the cities love to write these great football  songs about their favorite teams.  They all stink.  We were playing the Jet ones yesterday, and you had one for the Raiders?  Yeah, yeah.  And so now our listeners from all over the country are sending in their bad football songs. 
[01:19:00]  Songs that have actually been played on the radio, and, you know, people are actually  proud of these songs.  They're proud that they wrote them for their cities.  Are they as good as the Jet song we played yesterday?  Jet song, second worst song I ever heard now.  Really?  Well, the Al Dukes freaking painted black thing.  Ah, that was pretty bad.  Well, you have a personal interest in that.  I still think the Jet song is the worst song ever, ever.  Ever?  Ever. 
[01:19:30]  Where are we going for the Packers song?  Go Packers.  All right, here's another bad sports song sent in by one of our fine listeners.  Green Bay, we go Green Bay, we go see Packers, we watch them play, when there's four touchdowns.  We shout today, hey, we all have so much fun, we go Green Bay.  Emotionally outside is Edgar Bennett, here's Brett looking to the end zone, Brett dancing  around, Brett to the end zone, touchdown on the horizon, got knocked down as he caught 
[01:20:00]  the ball, but he held on, and the Packers have gone out in front by two touchdowns.  Yeah, that was another great play.  Green Bay is a place to be, when I come from home is the light for me, when I come from  me, when I come from my side, when I come from my side, when I come from my side, all the  people can slide up and cannot hide, oh, I'm where I wanna be, I'm where I wanna be, I'm 
[01:20:30]  hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry.  This is horrible.  This is really bad, yeah.  Supposedly, he goes into the Pacarena.  Hey, Pacarena.  Sorry, I was a little distracted.  Yeah, some guy just walked in.  Who was that?  What the hell was it? 
[01:21:00]  It's just some guy just trucking in the studio.  Rick had a like, hey, hey, hey.  It's a great security.  How did they get past every line of defense right through our studio door?  No, it was great.  The guy was trucking right in.  He looked a little suspicious, so Rick, you know, pulled him out of here.  All I saw was on his arm, he had a big first of the ninth air cab patch on his arm.  And I'm like, all right.  First of the ninth air cab, death from above, here he comes.  What is this? 
[01:21:30]  I don't know.  I think we might like this guy.  It's all right.  I guess we'll find out who he is next.  Did we have someone scheduled for the show?  Do you recognize him?  Is he?  Was that Mel Gibson or something?  I don't know who that was.  You look so much thinner on TV.  Thank God, Steve.  Steve's here to help us out.  Steve, thanks.  What?  You've got to start eating more.  You're losing your edge.  If no one tells me that someone needs to be removed, I cannot physically remove anybody.  Removed?  The guy made it all the way down. 
[01:22:00]  He's walking in the door.  He has like papers in his hand.  He's like, hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Aren't you like head security for the show, kind of?  One of your many hats you wear around here?  You actually have to inform security of the subject to be removed before security can  actually take it back.  Rick's here.  When I see someone of Hispanic descent that's a little bigger than me, I get a little paranoid.  Who was that?  That's Pablo Francisco.  Oh, Pablo, of course.  All right.  We don't know who he is.  He followed Stinky in.  Well, why is Stinky allowing him in here? 
[01:22:30]  I don't think he knew he was following him that close.  Terrorist.  Stinky, did you know that Pablo was following you right into the studio?  No, I had no idea.  I just gave him a time, Rick.  He was here.  He starts waving.  We're like, who are you?  Like, hey, who are you?  Get, get, get, get, get, get, get.  All right.  Do you want to say hi to him now that you insulted him?  No.  We'll go to the FU line.  We'll do a little thing here, and then we'll come back and we'll talk to Pablo. 
[01:23:00]  He's Hispanic.  He doesn't fly planes.  Don't worry.  All right.  And hopefully Ronnie will call because that pinball machine has got to go to death.  FU line.  Let's see what's going on.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the opiate Anthony FU line.  I want to say FU to Ron Dixon for giving everybody in the great city of Philly a heart attack on that last play.  Go Eagles.  Next message.  Yeah, this FU goes out to my ex-girlfriend, Melissa.  Hey, f*** you for leaving me two months before I leave for boot camp. 
[01:23:30]  You've got her slut, f***, dumpster.  It's only been a month since then, so I'm sure you're gargling some new guys.  F*** you or...  Next message.  I want to give a big FU to my math teachers for giving me all this stuff for homework because I was talking in class.  F.  F*** you.  Next message.  I wanted to say a big F*** you to my landlord.  He decided to tell me last night that he was going to sell my apartment to someone else and not give me enough f***ing time to get another f***ing apartment.  So, f*** you. 
[01:24:00]  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio.  And E.W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, the Friday edition, Anthony.  Yeah.  Short week.  Nice.  We get back on vacation and we only have to do three days.  Next week we talk about the Naughty Nighty contest.  Naughty Nighty.  Our virginity contest.  Yeah, for Valentine's Day. 
[01:24:30]  For Valentine's Day.  Our own version of the Super Bowl.  Yep.  All on the way.  Lester wants to say something real fast and then we got to get Pablo Picasso in here.  Lester, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey.  You guys rule.  Thank you.  Listen, man.  Now, I just got, I've been living here in this country since I was eight.  I'm 28 now.  And this motherfucker, I just, sorry.  I just went to school. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  And I can't go to school.  I can't get financial aid because they say I'm an immigrant.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm from Guatemala.  How can they tell?  Well, you know, I got a social security.  I got a passport, everything.  Yeah.  But they got no record of me before I was eight.  So they just blew me off.  You know?  They build you off?  They blew me off.  Ah.  Oh, blow?  But you're a citizen?  No, no.  I was born in Guatemala.  Well, you haven't become a U.S. citizen?  Yeah, but I've been here since I was eight. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, but have you become a United States citizen?  Well, I don't know.  All my parents were, they brought me here.  Go to the immigration office and become a goddamn U.S. citizen if you want to take up some of the goodness of America.  I can't because I went like two years ago and I was about to get imported.  What do you want from me?  How do you get imported?  Did he say imported?  I think he's going to be imported. 
[01:26:00]  You're going with the shipment of molasses?  That is so funny.  The guy is kind of bitching that he can't get imported.  It's not like I came in like a wheel, like a rubber wheel.  You didn't come in in the back of the truck or in an airplane landing gear or nothing?  Yeah.  I know, you know.  But, you know, it just sucks.  Well, you're not a citizen.  I'm nobody.  I mean, I'm forgetting Spanish and I can't learn English.  You know? 
[01:26:30]  You're telling us?  I like me too, you know.  And you're a fan of the show?  I've been hearing you.  I've been listening to you live for three years.  Thank you, Les.  Who's translating this for you?  No hablo inglÃ©s.  I enjoy the Hispanics.  All right, guys.  You guys rule.  You guys are a wacky bunch.  Later, guys.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  All right.  Call the INS.  I like that guy.  Yeah, he sounds okay.  We need new people calling this show.  The world needs ditch diggers too, you know.  Where's Pablo Escobar? 
[01:27:00]  No, that's Colombian drug kingpin.  Oh.  What are you talking about?  We got on the wrong foot with this guy.  Where's Pablo?  Well, he barged in.  Terrorist.  Pablo!  Is he playing foosball or pinball?  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Can you grab me on the show, guys?  But he also has the crazy eyes too, and on top of the weird jacket.  That's a jacket.  All right.  We got to explain.  Why did you come walking right into the studio? 
[01:27:30]  Not that we mind or anything, but you kind of freaked us out a bit.  Here, talking to the mic.  Okay.  He's a Yankee fan, Anthony.  Hello?  Hey.  I walked in because I thought it was going on, and then they put me to the pinball machine.  Action.  Romance.  Desire.  This summer has Brady written all over it.  O.P.  God damn.  You're the guy.  That's good.  I am working on his wife called me.  The movie previews guy's wife called me.  Yeah.  What's his name?  John LaFontaine.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  I saw a show on this guy.  They just drive him around.  He's in a limo.  Right.  He stops off at these various studios.  Right.  Makes tons of money.  Right.  And then he goes home.  They cut the check at the desk, and he leaves and goes to the next job.  He's just got to do these voiceovers for every movie you see.  The trailer walks right in.  Are you ready?  This summer, someone's playing a deadly game.  And then they write the thing out.  You rock, man.  His wife calls me up and goes, hey, you know, my husband's been walking around the house  going, who's his Pablo bastard? 
[01:28:30]  Right?  So she goes, he goes, but now he doesn't go on the limousine anymore.  He goes downstairs.  So they ask me to stand up.  Oh, yeah.  So they ask me.  Now he puts on his little Hugh Hefner robe.  Are you ready on NBC?  I've got to go back to the room.  It's terrible up here.  Just imagine making love that guy.  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  The passion in your eyes burns with desire.  Get it over with.  Ah.  Ah.  Coming soon.  To a theater.  All right.  God damn, that's good.  It's Pablo Francisco, Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  Ah.  Opie and Anthony, one man, two men, one radio station.  Get ready.  Casey Kasem says, I know, I listen to their show all the time, and my head is so big, it  looks like a cookie jar.  So reach in and pull out a fig newton.  It's incredible.  I'm Casey Kasem.  And now you can hear all your favorite Indian hits.  You got to rock, steady, steady rockin' all night long.  If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. 
[01:29:30]  Baby, please don't go.  Is that too much?  I'm sorry.  No, man.  Not at all.  It's a talk place over here, man.  We're at Caroline's all this weekend.  Ah, yeah.  Caroline's in New York City.  You guys going to come in, or are you guys too busy?  No.  We're busy.  Please, what are we doing?  No, Rick says you're hilarious.  I swear, I haven't seen you.  That's all right.  I apologize, but Rick says you're hilarious, and I would love to go to Caroline's and check  you out.  You know my bro, Carlos Benzio?  You know Carlos?  You guys are close?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're on tour together.  We got a movie coming out.  Carlos rocks.  Stupid weirdo.  Hey, what's up? 
[01:30:00]  I'm crazy.  That's right.  You're stupid beaners.  You're stupid beaners.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na.  I walk in a bar.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na.  I knew you were for me.  Ba-na-na-na-na.  La-na-na-na.  Stupid sticker.  Bumper leaker.  Stupid.  It's just Carlos.  I'm supposed to do a Latin station here.  They wouldn't take me, because you don't speak total Latin.  I can speak total fluent Spanish. 
[01:30:30]  Here we go.  Yeah, you don't really come across as a Spanish.  He's a white Latino.  Get ready.  It's like Rick.  Rick, Rick, Rick.  Rick, right there.  Rick's Puerto Rican.  Puerto Rican.  Come on, baby.  This is how Puerto Rican women talk.  You want to party?  Come on.  Let's do it right now.  Buy me hamburger.  It's going to be live, baby.  Come on, baby.  It's going to happen.  None of the Latin women. 
[01:31:00]  Come on.  You want something?  You want something with me?  Here.  Hold my baby.  Come on.  Let's go.  I'm going to take you.  I'm going to take you where?  I got to drive out of here.  I got to drive out of here.  It's crazy, baby.  Come on, Pablo.  You look like a lesbian.  Pablo looks like a lesbian.  I've got the lesbian haircut, man.  Yeah, keeping it tight.  I can pick up chicks at a techno club and walk in there.  Hi, I'm Julie.  Let's party.  Come on.  Let's go.  The techno music. 
[01:31:30]  No matter what the music says, people still dance to it.  Kill myself.  Kill myself.  Woo.  Slash my wrist.  Slash my wrist.  They have so much earrings on their face.  It looks like a tambourine.  Come on.  Let's party.  Come on.  Got something E or boo-boo or whatever.  That was a club we went to last night. 
[01:32:00]  You can say anything you want, man.  Boing, boing, boing, boing.  Who's to it?  Party, dude.  Wrong.  Ecstasy.  Take it.  It's a little aspirin.  Put it in your mouth.  And then when you drive home, that's when it hits you.  Boom.  Yeah, the drugs never hit at the party.  Yeah, they never hit.  Not when you want them to, right?  Yeah.  They did some of that mescaline on my way back from Van Halen.  Yeah.  What is it like?  Mescaline.  It was a little yellow tab.  Oh, okay.  Well, the warm at the bottom of the tequila box.  No, that's mescaline. 
[01:32:30]  Oh.  No, mescaline is, it's like LSD light.  Oh, really?  So you're like, hey, did we go to the concert?  It was great.  All right.  It was good.  All right, let's go.  I want to watch, you know, I want to be peaking like everyone else.  Peaking, man.  Peaking.  And watch, you know, David Lee Roth, the old Van Halen, go to town there in Nassau Coliseum.  Oh, yeah.  Up there on Long Island.  So I take it.  Everyone else is like, this is the best, man.  Dude, you see the trails come off of Lee Roth, the friggin' boot, man.  He did the kick, and I saw like a stream of light, and there's dragon. 
[01:33:00]  Like, I'm seeing nothing.  I'm seeing a great show, but that's about it.  I get in the parking lot, and I'm like, dude, you guys are effed up.  I'm driving home.  It's raining.  It's pouring rain.  I pull out.  I remember the story.  The second I hit Hempstead Turnpike, the wipers are going.  Right, right.  And the taillights of the other cars in the water on the windshield was like a kaleidoscope.  Was it like a warming experience?  Yeah.  Yeah, because normally I would have been petrified, but, you know, you're on the dope. 
[01:33:30]  What about the time you didn't leave the parking lot?  Because you thought something was going to happen.  There was an imaginary field around you or something?  Oh, that wasn't me.  That was a friend of mine.  Imaginary field?  Yeah.  No, he was tripping so bad.  He started crying and saying, there's too many cars.  There's too many cars.  And instead of going, let me drive, I'm okay, you go, come on, dick.  Don't be a pussy.  Get me home.  But you guys couldn't leave the imaginary area, right?  Between like four light poles or something?  No, that was Brewer.  With the darkness.  That was Brewer's story?  Oh, okay.  Jim Brewer got all...  Jim Brewer? 
[01:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Brewer's doing drugs at the Nassau Coliseum.  And his friend took them around the parking lot.  They were walking.  And he told them to go by this light and smoke something.  Right, right, right.  Exactly what the story was.  And there's the oil stains in the parking spaces.  And Brewer's like, this mother effer wants me to walk into the darkness.  I'm not walking into the darkness because I know he's the devil.  And he believed it.  It freaks you out.  It was a 10-30 waiter, Quaker Sater.  They're going into the darkness. 
[01:34:30]  It's the darkness, man.  Fox head.  One man on drugs in a parking lot.  Get ready on NBC tonight.  Walking into the darkness.  Brian also, dark angel.  Back to back.  Get ready.  Wow, that is horrible.  That's the guy, man.  I'm doing it for CBS, Bill, but, you know.  Into the darkness.  They could get you cheap instead of that guy.  They pay me.  I drive all across town.  I go, are you ready on CBS, King of Queens?  And then I leave and they pay me.  Action.  That's the only thing that guy could do for a living. 
[01:35:00]  He couldn't be like a mechanic or anything, you know.  Hey, how much for that transmission?  All right, that's enough.  Definitely, he's got the same voice, and then there are those different inflections he puts on it, depending on what the movie is.  That's right.  He can be, like, all happy.  Are you ready?  Here they come, all together from Disney Pictures.  Then it can be like, you know.  I don't know who this guy is, but I want him and his tortillas. 
[01:35:30]  Dead!  He had one chance, and his chance was to fight back Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Listen to me.  These tortillas, you have to get out of here.  They're trying to kill you.  Get out!  Get out!  Little Tortilla Boy.  And the sirens are coming everywhere. 
[01:36:00]  Ah!  Action.  That's great, man.  Just imagine a guy making you breakfast in the morning.  Two eggs are beaten beyond recognition.  Dude, you're evil.  You're evil.  You're hilarious.  That's great.  That's right, thanks, man.  Seriously, Pablo Francisco playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Check him out.  I think we've got to take a quick break, and you're hanging for a while, right?  Yeah, if it's cool.  You're going to be around when we smash that pinball machine?  Start me up on the pinball machine. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister, feel up your sister,  feel up your sister.  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are awesome.  It's like, I've got to listen to you.  It's like a drug.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, Pablo Francisco.  Hilarious.  Thanks, man.  Thank you very much, man.  Thank you.  Playing Caroline's all this weekend in New York City. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Who sings this?  Who sings this song?  This is Disturbed.  Disturbed.  Nice kid.  This is the music that we'll be playing when we smash the pinball machine.  Oh, good.  Oh, no.  They're still trying to hunt down Ron.  Are you guys going to really smash that pinball machine?  Oh, yeah.  There's a whole story that goes along with it.  When Ron calls, we'll explain the whole thing.  It's not like a wacky, like that's why we have this, it's wacky alert, you know.  Oh, wack, zenerific radio.  It's some guy that works for another show. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  Bought that pinball machine for Opie.  Right.  Because Opie wasn't giving him enough attention.  How sick is that?  Yeah.  I don't give him any attention.  Because I just don't like him.  It's the producer for the next show that comes on at 7.  So he bought you, like, that's a vintage machine.  Oh, yeah.  That's like, yeah.  We got a call earlier from Cleveland that's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, that exact same  moment.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I swear to God.  Someone offered us $1,200 for it.  No, it's not about the money.  It's worth about $28 right now. 
[01:38:00]  It's huge, yeah.  Opie can't stand the guy.  Can't smash it.  And, you know, he's told the guy to leave him alone.  He's almost like a stalker for Opie.  Someone's playing a deadly game on Opie.  Get ready.  We should play the Rolling Stones song he sang to me last night.  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Pablo.  It's weird.  The weirdness.  Like, how old is he?  I don't know.  30, maybe?  He's 30-something, yeah.  I don't even know.  Someone's playing a deadly game again.  So he bought me the pinball machine to get, I don't know, my attention. 
[01:38:30]  And I don't want to play the pinball machine.  And I'm embarrassed now.  Would you spend that much money on a chick?  You know?  What?  Unless it was...  She better be the best goddamn lady you've ever had.  She better be a porno star.  You ever have sex with a TV on and the TV's playing?  Because you just got deep into the sex and you can hear the...  And you're like...  Three's Company sounds like porno music. 
[01:39:00]  I'm done.  He gets the effect on the guitar.  How the hell do you do that?  You bastard.  You're going to make me come back in the city to see you now.  Are you going to come in?  I'm trying to walk in.  I swear to God.  I was just faking that.  Yeah, I'm going to go see it.  But now I've got to go see it.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on in.  Yeah, we'll see you. 
[01:39:30]  Who's not going to go see him now?  Pablo Francisco.  Let's go to Caroline's all this weekend.  Thanks, man.  So, yeah, he buys a pinball machine, $3,000, blah, blah, blah.  It's been a soap opera that's been going on for months.  I mean, the kid broke the foosball table that you saw out there.  Who broke that?  Yeah, the same guy.  Al Dukes, his name is, that bought Opie the machine.  He was in here one night during the Ron and Fez show.  Right.  And they got him drunk.  I don't know exactly how this happened.  He kissed another man.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:40:00]  He freaks out about his sexuality.  Because they tricked him, supposedly.  They tricked him, yeah.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  They tricked him.  I didn't know.  So, he runs outside and tips over the foosball table and breaks it.  Okay, so, this guy, what's his name again?  Luke.  Al Dukes.  Al Dukes.  He's kissing.  He's kissing men.  And freaking out.  And then breaking our stuff because he's pissed off about it.  Al Duke.  That could be, here could be a movie.  Out of the closet.  Into the streets.  One man. 
[01:40:30]  One producer.  One kiss.  He was a homie.  He was a homosexual.  Action.  Get ready for Al Dukes' sequel.  Gang bangers.  I can always say that.  I can tip my foosball thing over.  You know, now he's all pissed off that Opie isn't giving him attention.  And someone reminded me, Tim, on Line 7, I know the Ron and Fez people are here.  Ronnie's not.  Fez, he has already said that we could, you know, smash the pinball machine. 
[01:41:00]  I'm waiting for Ron's blessing.  Are you really going to do this?  You're really going to smash it?  I mean, you're going to take a hammer.  We just met you, right?  Let me tell you something.  He's frigging insane.  And any time people that he doesn't quite get along with or like or enjoy their company gives him a gift,  he smashes it usually right in front of him.  There's this pathetic mess called Stalker Patty.  It gets really unwatchable.  Who stalks him.  And every occasion, even Groundhog Day, she brings in a little gift.  What about the Christmas gift, Anthony? 
[01:41:30]  The Christmas gift this year.  The Kediva chocolates and the homemade.  It was Kediva chocolates and she made a little frame with glass on it  and kind of used an ink glue gun and drew some nice stuff on it.  So she talks.  And here, Opie, I'm giving this to you.  Happy birthday, Merry Christmas, whatever occasion it is.  Opie goes, oh, great.  This is nice of us tapping it a little.  All right.  Wham!  Just smashes it right in front of her.  And she starts crying.  She cries.  Yet she comes back every time.  You've got to get some of this on tape.  Oh, yeah.  In an Opie cam? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Well, then I did the thing with the Godiva chocolate.  Yeah, and then Godiva chocolate.  It's like, how much can you mess that up?  He takes the cover off, puts it on the floor, pulls it out, and just leaks on it.  Oh, God.  On the chocolate that she brought in.  What flavor is this?  I don't know.  Is this an interesting filling?  Quite lemon lime.  Some chocolate is sweating.  Urine everywhere.  Now get ready.  The stones are about to get rocked. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, that seems to be...  So a lot of people are like, ah, he won't smash it, or...  But he will.  But then he sang this song last night.  You've got to hear it.  It's only 30 seconds long.  This is after I wouldn't accept his stupid gift.  And I just want him to leave me alone.  No joke.  Right, right.  You know, I don't want to acknowledge him even.  Go ahead.  The vocal stylings.  Oh, Paige, the new machine, I have to take it back.  Called me a closet bag, I have to take it back. 
[01:43:00]  He thinks it's cute and funny now.  I screwed with the biggest show.  It's called Career Suicide.  At least he can sing.  Ope doesn't want a thing from me.  He wants a piece of my hide.  That sounds gay right there.  Ope still won't say hello.  I have to take it back.  Ope just wants me to go and take the machine back.  I tried to buy new friends. 
[01:43:30]  I tried to show some class.  I further burn the bridge.  I'm such a stupid ass.  Takes it in.  I just need to stop.  Takes it in.  Takes it in the what?  Takes it in.  I'm sorry.  That was wrong.  That was wrong.  That song needed nothing.  It was a bring, bring, bring.  Gosh, that guy went to his studio the whole nine yards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They did an apology to me at the end of the show.  We're trying to pick that up now.  It's just ridiculous.  Are you going to act it with what? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, the sledgehammer.  You see it?  No worries.  He's got a, not a sledge.  It's like, he has a Louisville slugger and sort of like a Gallagher smash the watermelon  type mallet.  I'm in his watermelon.  Rolling Stones.  You know, not the Gallagher two mallet.  Oh, Gallagher.  The Gallagher one, the original mallet.  Here's the mallet.  I love that Gallagher bit.  Oh, God.  This guy got some weight on it.  Yeah.  Gets me every time when he smashes that watermelon.  Listen to me.  I hear the, ah, ah, ah. 
[01:44:30]  I'm going to hear that.  No high score for you.  Ah, I hope you heard it.  And the Louisville slugger, which is, well, the number one choice of Al Capone.  This is like a wrestler's, you know, a weapon.  Oh, that was, what was his name?  No, it was a Saw Saw.  Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  Oh, no, he had the two-by-four.  Well, you know.  Let me tell you something.  I'm pissed off here, Pumper.  You got the Rolling Stones only play one tune on the whole machine.  It's going down.  If it was a Latin wrestler, 
[01:45:00]  It just went old school.  That's good.  I went old school, yeah?  Old school.  Uh, Gary, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Hey, man.  I'm sorry about yesterday.  What a great Islander game last night, Gary.  Oh, don't tease the kid.  Okay, no, no, no.  Are you taking me to Sunday?  Are you taking little Gary to the Islander game Sunday?  Gary, I cannot take you to Sunday's game because there is no game. 
[01:45:30]  Yes, there is.  Saturday.  But it sold out.  I tried.  Oh, I did try.  Do you have boxed?  Do you have tixies and tixies?  What's the deal with that?  You get a kid out all excited.  You know what to do?  Wants to go to the game.  No game.  I ain't calling up.  I ain't calling up.  This guy's promised this kid that he was going to take him to an Islander game.  And he'd bring his 12-year-old Puerto Rican girlfriend.  Come on.  What's the deal with that?  He's got to talk about it.  Groovy.  Oh, it's a what?  Do they even make condoms that small? 
[01:46:00]  Do you get behind?  Hey, hey, hey.  Take her to the booth.  Take her to the booth.  What happened to your girlfriend, Gary?  I don't know why she's a little freaking happy.  Wait, what's the problem you have on the next Jerry Springer?  So what's going on?  You say she's not putting out.  What's going on here?  You gave her such a stalking stuff.  What's the problem?  What's the problem with the girl, Gary?  No, it's all right.  She's just a freaking...  I can't even say the word that she is.  What?  Is she playing head games with you? 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  At 12, she's playing head games with the 11-year-old.  Love story.  Is she a CT?  Oh, God.  Oh, B.  Stop it.  What are you talking about, huh?  You want it?  You know you want it.  Take her to the booth.  Take her to the booth.  Take her to the booth.  Hey, let me get my friend, Drew Bidari.  Oh, yeah, there we go.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, you know you need it.  I'm done.  This kid has a girlfriend at 12 years old, man.  He's a little...  He's a little...  He's a little blow-up dolly. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, little kid's probably...  Okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  What kind of problems do you have?  Like what?  Like, you know...  Gary called because he said he wants to tell you, Pablo, that he loves you.  Who?  You're funny.  I saw you on Comedy Central.  Oh, thank you very...  Oh, yeah, okay.  I love you, Jerry Springer.  Jerry, you like my Jerry Springer?  Yeah.  All right, man.  You're the man...  The kid's a man now.  Yeah.  I'll back you up.  Any problems, man?  You let me know, man.  All right, I got a problem.  You got a problem?  Okay, what's the problem?  What's the matter?  With Osby.  No, I'm going to take you.  You are not taking him.  That season's going to end, and you're going to keep putting on an excuse after an excuse. 
[01:47:30]  If you do not take me, and they do not make it to the playoffs, I will tell Anthony, and  I'll tell everybody in the studio, never to let it down.  Hey, Gary.  Take a little flash dancers.  I talked to Ted from the Islanders last night.  They're playing the Kings Saturday.  There's not a ticket to be had.  Then what's the next game?  When's the next game?  You want to commit.  I have to commit.  I got to find four tickets, though, because he wants to bring his girlfriend. 
[01:48:00]  Mom, I got the four tickets.  Just me and you?  Just me and you.  Two guys hanging out.  That's a little dangerous.  Bring the shopping bag.  Crinkle, crinkle.  That's a lot of bling, bling.  You hear about the shopping bag trick?  What happens to the shopping bag trick?  It's when you go into the public bathrooms, like the bus station or something, with your  young lad.  Right.  And you can't have the police looking in under the stall to see a young lad's feet  standing in front of an older gentleman's feet.  So you bring the big shopping bag, and the young lad stands in the shopping bag. 
[01:48:30]  That way, it just looks like you've been shopping.  Oh, man.  Paper or plastic?  Here's the deal, man.  And all you hear is crinkle, crinkle.  Crinkle, crinkle as his confused little feet move about in the bag.  How do you know crinkle, crinkle?  I don't even want to know how he knows crinkle, crinkle.  Well, I remember when Norton brought it up when I said I was...  All right.  Don't worry about it.  Opie, you got to take him to a game.  That's what we say.  Gary, I'm working on it, I swear.  All right.  It's not even a bit anymore. 
[01:49:00]  If you want to bring your girlfriend, you could...  You can't.  Well, I asked...  No, I asked Ted last night.  There's not...  There's no tickets for Saturday, unfortunately, so we're going to have to figure out another game.  All right.  I'm going to get the tickets very soon, and then it'll be a date.  Not a date date, but it'll be a date.  You know what I mean?  We'll have the date.  Calendar date.  A discovery of the tickets.  Opie, one man, forensic tests conclude.  Someone touching me like bumbum.  Someone touch me like bumbum. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, yeah, I'm done.  Take it.  Take it to the base.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Gary.  Kid's smart, man.  What's the deal?  Look, it's not one of those kids you see on, like, Maury Pulvich.  Can't you thank her?  You're a very special boy.  You're a special boy?  You're a special boy, and then when they go to commercial, get this retard out of my face.  That's how Maury is.  Get this retard out of my face.  I want a hooker.  I want a bottle blocker.  I want a cigarette.  I can't say that.  You're a special kid.  I want a special. 
[01:50:00]  When they got the progeria kids out there.  I'm an ordinary nine-year-old boy.  It's great.  You know, I still like to play sports.  I'm going to Disneyland.  I have the body of a 95-year-old man, but I'm just a regular kid.  And Maury's a...  You're such a special, special kid.  He's like two years old in a 98-year-old body.  Hey, Gary.  You're stepping on my lines.  Yeah, Gary.  You're stepping on the lines, man.  I'm sorry about that.  You're stepping all over me.  Give that kid the shots.  All right.  Go get it on.  You're a special, special kid.  Gary, we'll talk to you soon. 
[01:50:30]  All right, guys.  Enjoy the Pablo.  What do you like about Pablo?  The Jerry Springer act.  You like the Jerry Springer?  Yeah.  So someone called you a bad name.  You like a boo-boo on a BB on boom-boom.  Here's some nunchucks.  Do something with the nunchucks.  Hit them over their head and we'll be right back.  I like when you act like that Texas guy and you go, I hate blacks.  Oh, I hate blacks.  I hate blacks.  Mexicans and Chinese people.  Well, we just happen to have some blacks and some Mexicans and some Chinese people. 
[01:51:00]  Let's bring up.  I'll kill you.  The kid's smart.  Go to my website and leave me an email.  PabloFrancisco.com.  All smooth.  That's very smooth.  And a picture.  And if you're from India, dot com.  You're a smooth whore.  Not like Dorn.  It's all sloppy and stuff.  Got the website and we got this hammer.  All right, guys.  Take care, Gary.  All right.  No rules.  Crinkle, crinkle.  There's little Gary, 11 years old, going on 30.  That's right.  A little story of a kid who gets in a shopping bag in a subway. 
[01:51:30]  You ever see, every time I point, you turn around, but I'm pointing to the screen here  that has all our calls.  Oh, he does that all the time.  I know.  All the new guests are like, who's he pointing at?  You had a CD out?  I have a CD.  It's the ones that we have, we have needed to grow.  It's like a clean version.  That was a new one.  But now we got, it's called Sausage.  No, I call it Sausage, but Sausage.  And we're still at the shows.  And so the proceeds go to 911.  Cool.  And it's pretty, you know, got everything, you know, got some things on there.  I'm going to have to pick that up.  I got to read this from Matt in D.C. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  About two weeks ago, Pablo performed down here in D.C. at the Improv to an audience of 140  Jewish teens.  Oh, I remember that one.  One of the teen youth directors was then fired.  Why?  Because of the content of the show.  Too blue for the 14, 15, 16, and 17-year-olds.  Oh, that was the two guys before me.  Those guys were heavy, man.  Oh, is that it?  No, I'm telling you, those guys were heavy.  I was like, I can't believe you do that.  See, I go up there and I get involved.  I'm Latino and Jewish.  Feliz Hanukkah.  Feliz Hanukkah.  He says, I'm one of the staff members and thought you were great, but the parents thought 
[01:52:30]  different after they heard about the show from their kids.  There was even a rabbi from the organization there, and he walked out after you started  giving a Hummer to the microphone.  That's not me.  That wasn't you.  That's a feature act.  That's what I mean.  Well then, Matt, you're wrong.  And the improv manager almost got fired because no one ordered alcohol.  It was all cupcakes and cookie coolers.  So, you know.  Yeah, comedy clubs are about the booze.  It's about the booze.  Make some cash with the booze. 
[01:53:00]  And I got the apology that happened at the end of the Ron and Fez show.  Ah, right.  As we jump around with Pablo and Gary, back to Al Dukes, pinball machine.  Nice show today, right?  Yeah, all right, so this is what he had to say at the end of the Ron and Fez show last  night.  We have one minute left in the show.  I'll move on.  Okay.  I made a simple gesture that I thought would help in our relationship here at work.  Relationship?  Where we might be able to say hello in the hallways.  And I think tonight it got examined into something much bigger. 
[01:53:30]  It was supposed to be a simple gesture that everyone could enjoy.  And at this point, I would just say, let's just be friends.  Why don't you put your pants up and stop rubbing yourself?  Joe Poo.  No, that's a guy I love.  Joe Poo's hysterical.  I say hi to Joe Poo every time I see him in the hall.  He's the other, like, pretty sure guy from the Ron and Fez show.  Did you hear what he said when they were...  Proving I don't have an attitude.  Right.  Some guys are like, some guys that don't.  Just like any other human on this earth.  When Ron was writing up Al Dukes' resignation letter. 
[01:54:00]  And he's going, I, Al Dukes, resign from the Ron and Fez show.  And Joe Poo goes, put Fag in there.  He's laughing my ass well.  Put Fag in there.  It goes on here.  Let him talk.  Sorry.  And that I didn't mean to make matters worse, if that's what happened here tonight.  This was supposed to make it a little bit better.  I didn't think it would solve the whole problem, but I thought it would make it a little bit better tonight. 
[01:54:30]  But he seemed angry on the phone these last couple calls.  That's right.  But that's not what I was trying to do.  I mean, I think we're a lot alike.  We're in the same business.  Oh, brother.  All right.  Hold on.  Listen to what he's saying.  Hold on.  I'm going to say this again.  I'm going to say this again.  This is no reflection on Opie and your masculinity or your sexual preference, because it's completely Al Dukes.  The guy loves you.  He is in love with you. 
[01:55:00]  How are we a lot alike?  Well, that's now in his head.  He's like, we're so much alike.  Why can't we go out together and hang and build a relationship?  He called it a relationship.  I've been doing radio since I was 17.  Scratching my way to where we are today, Anthony.  He has walked into one of the easiest radio jobs in America, working for one of the best radio shows in America.  You're talking about me?  Well, you did, too.  Oh, but that was eight years ago.  No, I'm just kidding.  And he works for one of the best radio shows in America, Ron and Fez.  He just stumbled upon this.  Yeah.  He should thank his relationship. 
[01:55:30]  There's so many questions.  Does Aaron Evels sing like you're trying to find a radio station?  Traffic on the 90.  Anthrax, Gary.  So many questions.  Still, Opie should have not answered.  Can you put us in that bit?  God. 
[01:56:00]  Are you doing that at Caroline's?  The way you walk, the way you move.  I was getting to Ja Rule now.  Can you do Ja Rule?  The way you walk.  Such a little body, such a weird voice from the makers of Star Trek 11.  Come Ja Rule, the way you walk, the way you move.  I've got something in my throat. 
[01:56:30]  I've got something in my throat.  It's a little super cold.  And then after a super cold, I'm Gary.  So what were you going to say?  You know what it is, dude?  You're unattainable to him.  That's what it is.  That's why he's attractive?  In a normal relationship or a normal environment, it would be like the girl that you can't get is the one that you want.  Or it's the girl that broke up with you.  That's why you want her.  Even though you were about to break up with her.  No, there hasn't been a relationship there. 
[01:57:00]  No relationship.  You want, he wants a relationship.  I barely know he's alive.  According to him, you're very much alike.  And he wants, he thought this would make the relationship better.  How are we alike?  Relationship.  Hoo-hoo.  Did he take you to dinner yet?  I worked my ass off in radio and he stumbled upon the greatest gig in the business.  You know how you're alike?  He probably hates himself, too.  That's it.  You're alike.  All right.  Here's the rest of his apologies.  Oh, there's more?  Like 15 more seconds.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  God, I hope Joe Poo says something to miss.  Is that it?  Was that it?  No, I mean, I just hope that one day down the road, me and him sit down, have a beer, and  laugh about this.  All right.  That's it for our show.  Sit down.  What are the odds, Opie?  Sitting down.  Hey, when was the last time you and I sat down for a stupid beer?  Was it Samuel Adams hanging around here right now?  Yeah, it was first to Sam.  Right.  Christmas party.  Christmas party.  Hung out, had a few beers. 
[01:58:00]  It's not like he has this image in his head of you and him sitting at a bar, throwing  some back, probably being the arm around the guy guy.  You know the arm around the guy guy?  Yeah, yeah.  You're sitting in the seat in the bar and you look in, you walk in and you go, why does  that guy have his arm around the guy as he's talking to him?  Like, Al Dukes is probably like, hey, the arm around the guy guy.  You're at the game and the guy's leaning over talking to the guy and his arm's around him.  But he's not gay.  It's just the weird thing he does.  Arm around the guy guy.  Arm around the guy guy is not necessarily gay. 
[01:58:30]  That's the weird part about it.  No, but Al Dukes is imagining that and you're throwing some back.  You're telling stories and he's like, yeah, that happened to me.  He's telling stories.  You're laughing.  And before you know it, there's a hotel room and I don't know what's happening.  Maybe he's tired.  Never know.  Maybe he's going around you.  He'll take a look.  Maybe a little touchy-feely.  Maybe he wants to go home and touch your thingy.  You never know.  What are you going to do?  I'm just saying, that seems to be where this guy is going.  And how boring am I when we're not here? 
[01:59:00]  I'm not a joy to be with.  I don't even know.  That's just it.  I'm not a joy to be with.  Nothing.  Don't worry.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's the last time you saw him?  I said, maybe if he sees how boring you are by yourself, he won't want to hang out with you.  I'm not that enjoyable.  I'm telling you right now.  It's no big whoop.  He probably loved the jerk in its story.  The NASCAR?  Oh, he probably loved that.  If I was there, he would have been satisfied. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, Vinny from New Jersey writes, ask Carlos to do his Tortilla Nader skit.  Oh, Carlos?  Okay.  Okay.  I think we already said Carlos.  Carlos?  Yeah, you did.  Carlos.  Part Carlos.  It's not Carlos.  Yeah, it's Pablo Francisco.  Part Carlos.  We just, okay, we'll do it.  I think I just did it earlier.  I'll call it a rewind.  Listen to me.  You have to get out of here.  The time to take my tortillas.  Double the action.  Triple the excitement.  Get down.  More excitement. 
[02:00:00]  Get down again.  Get down again.  Imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger doing like Huggies commercials.  I'm a big kid.  Look what I can do.  And I can pull him down in half.  He'd be freaking out because the kid's pee.  Because the kid's pee is blue.  I can't believe it.  His pee is blue.  What are you putting in my bottle?  Two thousand flashes.  What's going on here?  This is crazy.  Every comic does an Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It's a hack stock premise.  But do they do Jackie Chan?  In the forbidden world of comedy, it takes one man to change a light bulb. 
[02:00:30]  He traded his black belt for the borscht belt.  On amateur night, his own government's tear to the go on stage.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Jackie Chan, fight night at the Apollo.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Beef.  Beef who?  Beef broccoli.  He does his own stunts.  But unfortunately, he does his own jokes.  Your mama's so fat.  How fat is she?  She's so fat, Buddha rubs her stomach for good luck.  Peh. 
[02:01:00]  Peh.  Peh.  Peh.  I bet you're like nuts on her chin.  No offense.  His name is Chin.  All right.  Peh.  Oh.  Ooh.  That's all Jackie Chan, can you.  Oh, who, huh?  What happened, who?  Oh, but he makes up for it when he picks that ladder up and starts kicking six guys' ass.  Oh, yeah.  He gets in fights for the most stupidest reasons.  Hey, you.  What are you eating?  I don't know.  I eat banana.  Get him.  No.  Banana.  No. 
[02:01:30]  No.  Nice guy.  He's just walking down the street and six guys decided to kick his ass.  Hey, what do you got in your pocket?  Wallet.  Get him.  No.  Wallet.  No.  Friend.  Tony, what's going on?  Not much.  All right.  Oh.  Beating up.  What happened?  The cotton candy machine.  But what happened?  Spinning around.  The head's covered with big cotton candy.  Punch him in the head.  He rolls him around.  All right.  He rolls a big cotton candy head and then hits him.  That's right.  You're going to melt in someone's mouth right now.  I'm on a roll.  What? 
[02:02:00]  Egg roll.  Your mama's so fat.  She used two by four as chopstick.  I wrote all those fat jokes.  Who's there?  Orange.  Orange.  Who?  Aren't you going to kiss your ass?  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Boo.  Boo.  Cry baby.  Hey, what are you doing?  Praying to God and Jesus I love.  Get him.  Oh, no.  No.  Go to church.  No.  He's like David Banner.  Remember David Banner always gets his butt kicked in the incredible hole?  Yeah.  Remember he'd just go to a, can I be working here on the church?  Yes, you can, my son. 
[02:02:30]  But.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, yeah, every week.  This guy couldn't go one week without pissing someone off to the point where they wanted to  hit him.  No, no.  Maybe David was just an ass.  Yeah.  That's right.  Maybe David just didn't like him.  Mr. McGee was trying to tell us what's going to do.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It'll be Gary.  Hi, Miss.  Can you take me to a ball game?  Well, I can't do this.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  Oh.  Don't.  Don't make me angry, Mr. McGee. 
[02:03:00]  You don't like me when I'm angry.  I swear to God, I can get this cure for you.  One man.  On the road, Dr. David Banner, played by Bill Bixby, always gets his ass kicked in every  episode.  Get ready.  This summer has Opie and Anthony written all over it with David Banner, their guest star.  I can find a cure.  No, you can't.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You think you'd control it to the point where, all right, the lug wrench slips off the nut 
[02:03:30]  you hit your hand.  Man, we've all done it.  He does piss you off a bit, but to the point of turning you into the Hulk, you should really  have to be really pissed off before you turn into that creature.  Yeah.  You should pose for that, man.  Maybe we should have L call him up.  Like David Banner loses a quarter in a gumball machine.  Hey, Dave, calm down.  Jeez.  Like me last night on EverQuest. 
[02:04:00]  I went late, Dad.  Damn it.  I bet his pecker looks like a baby's arm holding an apple.  Was that dirty?  He was like, oh, oh.  Jackie Chan, what are you doing?  I'm making coffee candy.  What flavor?  Jerry, get him.  No.  No.  No.  I don't understand.  Happy.  Get him.  I'm getting him.  Oh, guys.  I believe we have a new friend, Anthony.  Pablo Francisco.  He's playing Carolines all this weekend right here in New York City.  We're going to take a break, and we'll continue.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with this stupidity.  Mindless.  Crotch-grabbing Anthony.  Mindless.  Crotch-grabbing Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches and saying, suck it.  The Anthony Show.  Suck it.  Law of the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Come on.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  No. 
[02:05:00]  No.  You got to kill the devil.  You got to know how it's going.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  We're checking out the comedy stylings, Anthony.  You never want to hear that.  The comedy stage.  And all the comedy stylings of Richard Jennings.  Richard Jennings.  Richard Jennings.  Pablo Francisco in the studio playing Carolines all this weekend.  Tickets going fast as we continue with Pablo.  You're telling me all the tickets are going fast. 
[02:05:30]  I made so much money by using little cups.  Just sit on a corner and go, gee, what's up, bro?  Can you help me out?  Can you help me out, bro?  It's amazing.  I went from a one-bedroom apartment to a 10,000-square-foot home.  It's incredible.  You'll be the oldest person on a corner with a cup and a cell phone.  Let's go to some people right now.  I'll tell you what, man.  I used that.  I used your system.  It was great, man.  I'll say, hey, can you help me out? 
[02:06:00]  I'm hungry.  Hello?  Yeah, I got a phone, too.  It's great, man.  I got a cup.  And you get a phone.  It's incredible.  Did you see the commercial for the real estate one where there's a bunch of them like it?  The Asian guys.  There's that guy.  There's the little midget guys.  The midget twins with the big dog.  That's right.  You can do it.  You took our corners.  That's incredible.  We're selling just as much as ourselves.  The funniest thing is they go to the testimonials to the people that have done it. 
[02:06:30]  And the whole thing is you have to go up to these buildings.  They're like, I bought and sold five buildings the past year, and I grossed $240,000.  And the whole gimmick is you got to go up to the building and ask to buy it with no money down and nothing.  You have to say, I now own the building, and I'm going to sell it and pay you back.  I'm just going to sell it for more.  But it's my building now.  My building. 
[02:07:00]  No money down.  You can do it.  Yeah, you have to talk the guy that owns the building into selling it to you for nothing.  For nothing.  Yo, yo, man.  You just give me the building.  Give me the deed.  Give me everything.  I'll sell it for more, and I'll be able to pay you back.  Oh, yeah, man.  Check this out, man.  You come to my crib, man.  I'll buy this house.  Check this out, man.  You know, let me tell you something, man.  I'll give you two little, these little white-looking Altoid things, man.  I'll tell you what.  You can smoke some of that stuff, man.  You can buy any house.  Let me tell you something, man.  Come on, man.  I never understood that, how these people went to the house and just went, hi, I own 
[02:07:30]  the house now.  No money down.  And I'm going to pay you back, but not today.  Not today, man.  I'll fix it up, too, man.  Oh, it's going to look real good.  Check it out, man.  Look.  Look how the house is broken right now.  And I close the door, and it's fixed.  And I close these windows, lock it up.  It's fixed, man.  You know what I'm saying?  See, but now the house is mine.  Because I fixed it.  It's incredible.  It's incredible.  Started my own game.  My side hurts, man.  That's great. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, man.  Yo, Crystal.  Hey, Crystal, what's up?  Crystal.  Hi, Chris.  Hi.  Listen, I have a problem downstairs from my boyfriend's house.  I just caught him having sex, you know, with my best friend, and I start beating the  crap out of him.  Stop it.  Someone's playing a deadly game.  Double love.  Burr from Vivid brings you one woman.  Okay, I'm sorry about your pain.  Hey, Crystal.  Crystal, turn down the radio.  Turn down that goddamn radio.  I'm sorry, what was that? 
[02:08:30]  Turn down.  In a police car?  That's our show.  It's like a 40-second delay.  Yeah.  Crystal, turn down the radio.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, what's the problem?  No, I just called my boyfriend because he tells me to come over to the house.  Now, all of a sudden, now, you know, I catch him into the house, you know, and he's, you  know, banging my friend.  I, well, he was hinting.  You don't sound, he was hinting.  You don't sound upset.  Oh, yes, I am very upset. 
[02:09:00]  Where is he now?  He's upstairs.  And where's your, and where's your girl, and your girlfriend, is she there too?  Yeah, where's the whore?  Wait, you're in the house with the guy right now?  No, I'm downstairs in my car.  And he's in the building?  You're right outside the house?  Yeah.  You got the cell phone?  Yeah.  Walk it back in.  Let's, uh, let's work this out.  No, I don't want to work that with him.  Well, we do.  We do.  No, I don't want to.  No, I need to keep it back.  Because Lord knows we need the ratings.  Get back in that house.  Yeah, yeah, get in the house.  Get yourself a nice little bowl of Lux and Kugel. 
[02:09:30]  What's going to happen?  Oh, my God, he's running out to me.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Because he listens to the show.  Who are you talking?  Hello.  Hey, who's this?  Who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Who?  What are you doing?  Banging, uh, banging, uh, some girl?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got that right.  What happened?  I don't know.  My girl, Crystal, is just annoying me, man.  You know?  Wait, wait.  You have to understand.  I don't complain about her being a lesbian with this girl from there.  I really don't complain about that.  Hold on, hold on.  The girl you just banged, uh, does lesbian stuff with Crystal? 
[02:10:00]  No, that's a different girl.  But she's in front of me.  And I'm supposed to, you know what I'm saying?  I gotta have my fun, too.  No, so...  Wait, you can't write stuff like this.  This is too good.  Wait a minute.  So then you invited Crystal to come over, and when she came into the house, you were banging  the other girl?  Oh, yeah.  Just to teach her a lesson, or what?  I don't know.  I'm kind of shocked that she caught me at all, but, hey.  Well, didn't you call her up?  Turn that radio down. 
[02:10:30]  Hold on.  Turn the radio off, or we gotta hang up.  So...  All right, I got you.  Okay, listen to me.  Now, what I need you to do is go and grab her, all right, and make sure that your muscles  are big and flex here, because if you have a V8, make sure you have that.  You're going to have plenty of water when you have it.  Are you hard on the front?  No, no, a little bit of that.  I'm just hands on a front, okay?  Let me tell you, so this is a hands-on training.  You can do it.  We're very proud of you, but you're making a young lady very pissed off here.  So, what you need to do is give a V8, have her cylinders come down a little bit here. 
[02:11:00]  It's going to be good, and I hope the fire and the explosions happen to you all the time.  Well, what did you think was going to happen when you called her and invited her over?  Well, the other girl came last minute.  Oh.  So, why didn't you call the other girl to go home?  Actually, it was a surprise, because she got the key, so she just came over and just,  you know, popped up.  So, you decide to bang her, and then Crystal shows up, catches you banging the other girl. 
[02:11:30]  Now, she's pissed.  She goes outside and calls us.  You come running out of the house, and now you're on the phone, right?  Yep.  Now, what is Crystal?  I don't know what she took off now, so.  She took off?  Yeah.  Without her phone?  Then get back in the room and finish your business.  Exactly.  There you go.  You can do it smart.  There you go.  Can we talk to the other girl you just banged?  You want to talk to her?  Yeah, put her on.  Put her on.  I got to go upstairs.  Well, you got the cell phone, right?  You got a Crystal cell phone, because she took off without it, right?  Yeah, hold on.  All right.  Is that it? 
[02:12:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm not buying this, Hopin.  You're not buying this?  No.  Hey, what are you doing, huh?  I'm not buying it.  Someone's playing a deadly game.  A man runs to the house on NBC.  Get ready.  All right.  Who's this now?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Watch him disguise his voice.  Hello? 
[02:12:30]  I'm her.  All right.  All right.  We're hanging up on you guys.  Yeah.  We're hanging up now.  It's a good bit, but you got to, like, you know, you got to work on it.  You got to plan it out better if you're going to try to fool somebody with it.  You got to work on it a little bit.  Maybe shoot some rounds in the sky or something.  Sure.  You never know.  What are you going to do?  You got to go?  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, she don't want to talk.  She's, like, totally embarrassed right now.  And they're probably going to get into, like, a fist fight if she comes back.  What's her name?  All the listeners are saying this is fake, dude.  What's up?  It was a good try, though.  You got it.  Yeah.  You're faking us, right? 
[02:13:00]  No, I'm not.  Seriously.  No, go ahead.  You got to admit it now.  We're on to you.  What?  Yeah, admit that you faked the whole thing.  Yeah, you got to admit it now.  We're faking the whole thing.  We're on to you, so at least be honest.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Yeah, I'm faking this.  Oh, God.  Say, say.  You got it.  You got it.  Say.  You got it.  They are the sex detectives.  Say, you're not going to pull the wool over our eyes like that.  All right.  Well, it was a good try. 
[02:13:30]  They had me full for a while.  For, like, a minute.  Like, when the girl first called up, and then it just got weird.  She gives the phone to the boyfriend and leaves.  Ah, I wasn't buying that.  It's too bad.  It's had a good show going on.  And then all of a sudden, you know, the limo driver's waiting outside, ringing the bell,  sees O.J. come in, and then O.J.'s home all of a sudden.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it.  On the next Judge Judy.  So, she's having sex with you, but you don't know, but you leave your sick.  Your phone with her, stinky?  That's not enough. 
[02:14:00]  That's just not a lie.  You're lying to me.  You're stinky.  Do I got stupid on my face?  Do I got dum-dum?  Do I got stupid?  On the next Judge Judy.  She gets involved in everyone's weirdest problems, too.  The bubblegum machine fell off.  Oh, my God!  Bubblegum machine!  Just imagine making love to her.  I love you.  Prove it!  Let's see the receipt.  I've seen you naked.  We've had sex.  I have my decision when I come back.  That's how her husband talks, because he's that people's court judge. 
[02:14:30]  Bubblegum machine!  You want me to touch my thing?  I'm like, boo-boo-boo-boo.  That poor son of a bitch.  He just saved us, Ant.  He just saved the segment.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pablo.  We didn't know how to end the fake radio bit thing that he was trying to pull off.  You're not having sex.  Quacky-cook.  Schmackety-quack.  Anthony, you know, we've been having so much fun with Pablo Francisco,  playing Carolines all this weekend here in New York City.  Yeah, we almost forgot about our great new feature.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  I swear to God, I forgot all about it.  I didn't even think about it until right now.  But girls are calling like crazy. 
[02:15:00]  Uh-oh.  So we've got to go to Crystal on Line 9 here.  Crystal.  Crystal, what's up?  Look, we don't even have the sweeper ready.  We forgot.  Crystal.  Crystal.  Yeah?  What's going on?  Not much.  Just chilling at work.  Where do you work?  At a gay-ass dollar land in Philly.  A what?  A gay dollar land in Philly.  Gay dollar land?  Dollar land?  What's dollar land?  Wait, you work at one of those everything for a dollar places?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[02:15:30]  What kind of merchandise you got there for a buck?  Um, nothing of interest.  Do you got the little army man with the parachute that you throw up in the air and it comes down?  No, but we have the cowboys and Indians.  Oh, can I get a whistle?  You got a whistle for a buck?  Sure.  I used to like the five and ten when I was a kid.  You go in there with a buck and come out with a bunch of little toys.  Ah, those are the days.  Crystal, how old are you?  Nineteen.  Nineteen.  Now, this is what you're doing with your life, working at the dollar store? 
[02:16:00]  Well, I have an interview on Monday, actually, for a tattoo place.  Yeah, all right.  You just come on in here.  We're going to take some tattoos.  We're going to put some jewelry right down there where it don't belong.  You know what I'm saying?  You're going from the dollar store to the tattoo place.  We're moving on up, yeah.

When did you break Daddy's heart?  When did Daddy realize that you were going to be nothing? 
[02:17:00]  Daddy left Mommy a long time ago.  She has a good sense of humor, though.  How old were you when Daddy left Mommy?  Uh, 10.  Yeah, okay.  I nailed it, eh.  You smoke a lot of weed?  Huh?  You smoke that weed?  You smoke pot?  Nah.  Nah.  You drink?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you like?  What am I like?  No, what do you like as far as drink goes?  Oh, yeah, your moisture.  Oh, God damn.  She probably gets it for a dollar there at the dollar store. 
[02:17:30]  The little nips.  It's so cheap here.  I tell you, she drank all the time.  I'd hire her the other day.  She'd come on in here, right?  She'd come on the phone.  She'd always talking on dollar time.  You know what?  She'd keep on drinking for a dollar.  God damn.  You know, go to a tattoo shop.  Who cares?  Did Mommy and Dad have high hopes for you there, Crystal?  Well, did that?  Did they have high hopes for you when you were growing up?  Um, no.  You could just tell the family life was a mess.  Come on.  We'll see you on Ricky Lake.  You could tell.  Poor chick.  I like Crystal.  She has a good sense of humor, though. 
[02:18:00]  At least she's drinking the right stuff, man.  Jaeger will drown those sorrows in no time.  And take care of a cold.  Yeah.  It's like cold, sir.  I love it.  All your problems.  And you get to trip a little bit, too.  How old were you when you lost your virginity there, Crystal?  Uh, 13.  Yeah, okay.  Who was the lucky person?  It was falling right into place.  Who was the lucky uncle?  Oh, God.  Evil.  Evil's obsession. 
[02:18:30]  Were you drinking Jaeger?  No, it was actually Southern Comfort.  All right.  Southern Comfort.  You know something?  Here we go.  More 13-year-old chicks have lost it drinking Southern Comfort.  You're not alone.  God.  Did he take you out to dinner, at least?  Uh, yeah.  We got a happy meal at McDonald's,  and that's when the action took place.  There's your goddamn dinner, convict.  Five years later, I got it.  We're going to make this place smell like a waffle house. 
[02:19:00]  Waffle joke's always funny.  Was it from a stereo salesman in a dugout?  In a dugout?  Somebody's baby.  Remember that?  In Fast Times original.  It's going to be somebody's baby tonight.  Going to shine tonight.  Wasn't it Ron Johnson's stereo salesman?  As soon as he lost, as soon as he lost, it went,  That was Damone in the pool cabana.  What's going on here?  Hey, you wanted it as much as I did. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, you want tickets to Van Halen?  Hey, Rhett, would you get that shirt out of the hamper?  I can't believe you had, I can't believe you did that to him.  I can't really believe that.  Shh, in the shower, shh.  I can't believe you, you touch your thingy.  They put music to it, and they filled it.  It's a movie called Fast Times original high,  and they put it in it, and you're in it, too.  And you're having sex with it.  Hey, you're assistant to the assistant manager at the movie theater.  That's it, that's it.  Yeah, they get into the big fight. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, this is great iced tea.  Hurry up, or my mother will be coming home soon.  Hey, what's going on, huh?  Someone in here?  Hello?  What's up?  Thought you could use some help with your math homework on such a hot day. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, you got him down.  You got him down, Bob.  She's so high.  Take you to the base and do it before we go swimming.  Oh, is it after we go swimming?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  She's got to be so high.  She's got to make somebody finish.  She's got to work at a doctor's store.  She's so drunk.  All right, so who did you lose your virginity to, Crystal? 
[02:21:00]  Well, I'm not exactly going to say, but it was a guy in a band.  It was a guy that what?  In a band.  In a band.  Popular band?  Or was it kind of like this kind of band?  Here and here, here and here, that kind of band?  Was it a band that anyone would know, or local band?  Yeah.  Local or national?  Um, well, yeah, national.  Come on, what band?  Whoa, and you were 13.  I'm not saying.  Can we play guess what band band? 
[02:21:30]  Is it rock?  Is that going to be part of the new format?  These are the new categories of Humping Crystal.  Rock band, grunge, funk and soul.  I'll take.  We need new games for our show.  This is perfect.  Guess what band, Bang Crystal?  All right, let's do some math now.  She was 13, she is now 19.  Six years ago.  So we're looking at a band.  1995, 96-ish.  Were they a national act at the time?  No, they were not. 
[02:22:00]  Okay, no, they were not.  Were you from Philly?  Yes, but the band was not from Philly.  Oh, okay, band not from Philly.  All right.  Not from Philly.  Pablo, it's to you.  Was it the lead singer or bassist, guitarist or drumist?  That's a lead singer.  It would have been the singer.  Yeah.  It's got to be.  It's got to be the singer.  13 years old, you know.  Freak.  Freak.  Okay.  There's got to be yes or no questions.  All right, can I ask you a question? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, but it's got to be yes or no.  I'm going to.  Pablo was screwing it up with all of his choices.  Lead singer.  Was he?  Columbo clue.  Columbo clue.  Was he bald?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Did he shave his hair at that point?  Dude, they were popular.  What year?  Well, I don't want to guess that band yet.  Don't guess it.  All right, bald.  Bald lead singer.  At the time?  At the time?  Not nationally known in 96, right? 
[02:23:00]  No.  Where the flow?  No, no.  Look, look.  We're looking at 1996, okay?  They were not a national act then.  Were they a national act in 97?  No.  98?  Yeah.  1998, national act.  Four years, that means they could possibly be up to their third album?  Uh, no. 
[02:23:30]  Are they still together?  Are they still together?  Oh, are they still together?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Grunge rock?  Come on.  Get us in a category.  No.  Were you, uh, uh, okay.  How tall were you back then?  God.  What the hell?  Question is that.  I want to see how hot she was.  Some of these bands have morals.  How much did you weigh?  And were you with another chick when you're doing it?  Huh. 
[02:24:00]  Let's see.  You were 13?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  What are you shocked?  It's a rock band.  What did you look?  How did you look?  You were 13, but how old did you look?  Uh, I'd say about 17.  All right.  During this, uh, time, did you squat in a kitty litter box at any time?  Nope.  All right.  Takes Motley Crue out of it.  Yeah, we're doing a radio callback.  You understand.  Callback.  I got the callbacks.  We got the paper.  Okay. 
[02:24:30]  Let's get back on track here.  We're looking now at 1998 National Act.  Bald.  Bald lead singer.  Um, still popular today.  Still, still popular.  Do they have a song that you would hear on the radio today?  Nope.  Aw, see?  That makes it harder now.  All right.  Uh, would you have heard, did they have a top ten hit?  Uh, no.  Okay.  Aw, okay.  We're looking at more of a fringe type.  Oh, I got it! 
[02:25:00]  What?  Oh, no.  Well, uh, maybe.  Jesus Christ.  What?  What?  What?  Holy S.  Oh, wait.  They're still together?  No, they're still together?  They're still together.  Yeah.  Oh, Billy.  Are they on the...  I was going to go with Billy Clark again, man.  Billy Clark.  They had top ten hits, though.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Damn it.  He's an effing tool.  He's an effing tool.  So it was in tools.  It was a tool.  Oh, wow.  No.  Okay.  Oh, come on.  All right.  98.  They hit in 98.  All right.  When they finally broke, um... 
[02:25:30]  Bald headed.  Did they have a song on the radio?  Like local college radio, but...  You know, I think you're putting a little more fame into this band than we would.  Black or white?  What was that?  I think it's a black guy.  Black or white?  White.  White.  Damn it.  There's not many white ball guys that were around in 98.  It's a grunge band, you know, because...  Yeah.  Is it...  They weren't grunge.  They weren't grunge.  Okay.  Oh, they R&B, like, yo, girl, you know what's true. 
[02:26:00]  Rap metal.  Rap metal.  I would say, like, hardcore punk.  Hardcore punk.  Oh, jeez.  Now we're getting...  Did he take Propecia?  This is quirky.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Opie's got a hint.  Hold on.  I got to write it down.  You think?  He's not bald, right?  He's...  Oh, God.  Oh, that's good.  Oh.  Well, it's not what...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's not bald?  Well...  Yeah, he is.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me ask this. 
[02:26:30]  Is he a short guy?  And, dude, the radio.  Yeah.  They had radio play.  Oh, please.  Yeah, still.  Fred Durst?  Jesus Christ.  No.  No.  Give you more credit than...  My answer is...  Give you more credit than Fred Durst?  Smash Mouth.  Smash Mouth?  Quw, quww, quw, quw, quw, quw, quw, quw, quw, quw, quw, quw.  And they also had a lot of radio play.  We're talking about a very obscure band here.  Well, someone wants to guess to Sturbed.  That's the obvious choice.  And the answer is...  Huh?  Not Sturbed, right?  Next category. 
[02:27:00]  Of course not.  And it's not live, right?  No.  That is so...  Well, you know...  It's all the hardcore punk.  And we're not there.  It better be a band we know.  Yeah, you've got to use your brains.  I'm trying to pump up my friend's band.  Was it Big Chocolate?  God, I can't.  You know, I'm not very up on local PA, Philly punk bands.  Not PA.  You're not even paying attention, man.  All right, all right.  Is the band from New England? 
[02:27:30]  New York.  Oh, they're from New York.  Yeah.  New York band, what?  No, the guy's bald.  Joey Ramone after the chemo.  Oh, okay.  Does he put a wig on to go on stage?  What was that?  Does he put a wig on to go on stage?  No.  Does he sound like...  Someone wants to guess Right Said Fred.  It's not Right Said Fred.  Right Said Fred.  Oh, 311. 
[02:28:00]  What, 311?  No.  They're not even from New York, are they?  Is it POA?  Huh?  POA, Presidents of the United States of America?  Did they ever open up for Cree?  No.  Were they headlining when they were here?  All right, you guys, we've got to go back to the questions.  I know.  What did we know?  Pete Creed went, like, so fast.  Hold on.  I think he's dead now.  Who are they?  Is he dead now?  You better tell me this is your boyfriend, I'm hungry.  Crystal, is he dead or alive?  Alive.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Okay.  They just don't have a song out now.  They're still popular, though.  It's Liquid Todd.  Liquid Todd.  No.  Well, they're not exactly mainstream, so.  Yeah, well, Paul Schaefer.  But they're, like, very well-hitting.  Hey, Dave, you got it, babe.  The dude from Biohazard?  No.  It's not the guy from Stain, because it's a New York band.  New York band.  Still together.  They went national, though, in 98, but there was no airplay?  What is it, comedian A.J.E. White?  Was it him?  I don't get it. 
[02:29:00]  All right, break it up.  What's the deal?  Hardcore punk.  I'm getting jealous, man.  Hardcore punk, Moby.  No.  Moby.  Moby, I think.  I think Moby goes the other direction.  Stop bald.  No, Midnight Oil, guys.  Let's wave a wave of flow.  Bad religion.  Bad religion.  Give us a clue.  Crystal?  I'm just lying.  Give us a clue.  Huh?  Give us another clue.  We need a clue.  Um, I don't know what else is. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, was his music on MTV?  Um, I think at one point, yeah.  Oh, all right.  Well, thank you.  Now we're getting a little...  Yeah, this band is not as popular as this band.  Yeah, she thinks she is.  Hmm.  She'd like to think she was banging.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Popular rock.  Is that when I woke up on Tuesday?  Isn't this crazy?  She's working right now, too, isn't she?  All right, I'm going to say a couple of bands here.  You've got to tell me yes or no.  All right? 
[02:30:00]  Was it rancid?  Who?  Uh, Murphy's Law.  Ah, no.  Wait, she said who to rancid?  Rancid?  It would be more, um, I guess, closely related to, like, the whole Murphy's Law scene or whatever.  All right.  Was it rotgut?  No.  Okay.  Was it menudo?  I don't know.  It was kind of hazy back then.  Kind of hazy.  What?  Sick of it all?  Sick of it all?  Sick of it all.  I wish. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, she wishes.  Elton John without his wig.  Who's up for crying out loud?  Crap.  We're not going to get it.  David St. Hubbins from Spinal Tap?  Black Lab?  Black Lab?  What was that?  The guy from Black Lab?  Black Lab.  When was the last time they played?  Was it on a tour bus you humped them?  No.  When was the last time they played?  Um, oh, jeez, I don't even know. 
[02:31:00]  She don't know.  Sometimes, but, like.  You're not helping with this game.  Where was the deed done?  Within the last six months.  Future Chicken Farmers.  Wow.  Good callback.  Did it happen on the tour bus backstage?  She said it didn't happen.  She said, where did it happen?  In your mind?  Did it look good?  Crystal, it was propane?  Nah.  Okay.  Damn it.  I can't believe we don't get it. 
[02:31:30]  No one's ever heard of it.  Was it the Newman News?  Joe Jackson.  Give us the first.  Joe Jackson.  All right, now you've got to help us.  Give us the first letter.  Into the night.  Give us the first letter of the band.  Huh?  You've got to give us the first.  I'm not going to compromise the integrity of the band.  Come on now.  Come on, you slip with them.  The first letter of the band isn't going to give it to us.  Please.  You can still deny it.  Anthrax.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Come on, they're all bald-headed.  Hey, Crystal, is it Anthrax? 
[02:32:00]  No.  What?  Nope.  Oh, wow, that was good.  I don't know, man.  They've been around for a long time.  Was it Anthrax?  No, it was not.  Was Jim Norton in a band in 96?  Stop it.  She's alive.  Life for the Indian.  Life for the Indian.  Life of agony.  Just say anything now.  Celery sticks.  That's the one.  That's the one.  Crystal, come on, man.  Give us the first letter.  Yeah, we can't waste 20 minutes on this without a finish. 
[02:32:30]  We might have Pablo Francisco have to help us out with another segment.  Come on.  First letter, Crystal.  I kind of might get in trouble with my man trying to do all that.  Is this your man listening right now?  Probably.  There you go.  I'm your boss.  Get back to the dollar store.  I'm not going to beg, Crystal.  First letter.  Come on.  Please.  I can't believe you helped Minuta.  I can't believe it.  Crystal.  No, man.  I'm telling you.  Let's all respect.  Crystal, you've got to help out the show now.  We just wasted 20 minutes on this. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, now we can't just hang out.  That wasn't even why I called.  But people are going to hate us.  Come on.  Yeah, come on.  You've got to help the show.  You're not going to hate you.  If you enjoy this show, help us out.  Come on.  Give us the first letter of the band.  That's it.  That's it.  I can't do that.  Why?  Because it's a cue?  The integrity of the band.  Yeah, it is.  It is a cue?  Good drinking.  No, no, no, no.  God damn it.  That would really give it away. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  We may have to compromise our scruples and give her a goddamn CD or something.  Scruples?  I got ointment for that.  We're going to have to give out one of our CDs?  One of our...  You want a CD, t-shirt thing if you give us the first letter?  Date with Jim Gordon.  What do you need?  Come on.  We'll give you a little prize if you give us one letter.  Come on.  You and your boyfriend can come to New York City to check out the Opie and Anthony show live.  I need a place in New York City. 
[02:34:00]  You work at a dollar store.  Come on.  You could get some help from this.  I'll give you two dollars.  You could buy two things at your store.  H2O.  No.  Oh, my God.  Crystal.  Goshdammit, tell us.  We're not going to have day here.  We're sitting on our ashes waiting for you to come up with a band.  But no.  Dollar store?  Sleeping with bands or no?  Goshdammit, do it. 
[02:34:30]  Is it Civ?  No.  This is blue ball radio at its best.  Yeah, I know.  You're pissing us off now, Crystal.  You got to do us a favor.  Fugazi?  Fugazi?  Moongoose McQueen?  Come on, Crystal.  Give us something.  Type O negative.  Type O negative.  Who?  Give us something.  Good rats.  Good rats.  You're getting me in so much trouble. 
[02:35:00]  Come on.  Vision of disorder?  Dog eat dog?  Look at it.  You just go through the computer.  Okay.  Let's check it out.  Scotty, give me a dog eat dog.  Rat.  Rat gang.  That's right, all I got.  Pantera.  Pantera.  Oh.  She's pissing me off now.  I'm getting really mad.  I don't think I'm getting really effing mad.  Is your boyfriend going to get pissed off?  He's probably going to call your boyfriend.  Oh, no, I can't call your boyfriend.  Come on.  Please, Crystal, please.  We are begging now.  What?  Give us a letter, God damn it. 
[02:35:30]  You'll be like a hero with our show.  Goshdammit, I got to go to the bathroom.  Fine.  S.  S?  S.  Saliva.  No.  S.  That's Tennessee.  Thanks, man.  All right, it starts with an S.  New York band starts with an S.  Stray Cat.  Five, six years old.  No hits on the radio right now.  A little bit of MTV play, right?  Well, they got coverage, not a play. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, no, now it's getting lower.  This is nothing, man, that we won't even know about.  Well, actually, they won battle all the bands back in 97.  Well, you said they were, like, popular.  That was my neighbor's friend.  It's not the Spin Doctors.  Come on.  If you were in a popular, like, semi-popular, well, a not popular band back then, and you  banged a 13-year-old, call us up.  It does start with an S, though, huh?  Yeah.  How old was he, Crystal?  Oh, God.  I don't even know how old he is now. 
[02:36:30]  How old was he then?  How old?  I think he's, like, 30 or something now.  Yeah.  Have you talked to him?  Got that number?  What?  Come on.  You know what I said.  You got that number?  I will guarantee that we won't even know the band.  Yeah, I know.  That's what it is.  We won't even know who it is.  A liar.  Be honest.  Sam works at a dollar store.  Sam Platera?  If we take you off the air, will you tell us?  Can you say it on the air?  No, it's not coming out of your mouth. 
[02:37:00]  Unlike, well...  On the next line, Angel.  Will you tell us off air?  Come on.  Tell us.  We'll take you off the air.  But you got to do it quick.  Maybe, because then it won't be coming from my mouth.  Right.  Hold on.  Then anything we say can be a lie.  We'll go to the music.  Hold on.  Go to the music.  We love going to the music.  Hold on.  We interrupt this program.  Oh, yeah.  Do it this way.  We'll be back after a momentary lapse of consciousness.  This is a test of the American broadcast system.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:37:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, my God.  What kind of band's that?  What?  What?  Scarhead?  Scarhead?  Who the hell is Scarhead?  Steve, do you know who Scarhead is?  I have no idea.  Steve never heard of Scarhead.  You know what?  They're a piece of crap.  But now, Scarhead, stinky.  I've never heard of Scarhead. 
[02:38:30]  Crystal?  Axer.  You deserve to work in a dollar store.  No, no, no.  Your dollar information leave nothing.  Starscream Hatch will get nowhere with you.  Scarhead?  Scarhead?  Who's Scarhead?  Who's Scarhead?  They're in the New York Hardcore base.  They never were on MTV.  Were they on MTV?  No, they never.  No, there was a piece on, like, Hardcore and the violin.  Yeah, they were in the background.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Scarhead.  They showed their flyers stepped on in the front of the building, man. 
[02:39:00]  We went from love and doing it.  Scarhead to Haiti.  Yeah.  Scarhead.  I told you you wouldn't know them.  And you will not be, Bob, doing the 6 o'clock queef today.  Oh, now it's 619.  6 o'clock queef.  Scarhead.  They don't even come up on a Yahoo search.  Yeah.  Who?  That's Yahoo.  Oh, my God.  I'm in trouble.  They don't even come up on a search on the Internet. 
[02:39:30]  A little thing called the Internet.  Awful.  Thank you, Crystal.  Good day.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  The end.  Goodbye.  She's laughing with her Jaeger in the back of the store of the dollar place.  I got to get to work.  God, did that not work.  Boy, that was...  I am telling you what.  Ron and Fez outside the studio.  Oh, thank God.  Ron and Fez outside the studio. 
[02:40:00]  Frank knows who Scarhead is.  All right.  Who cares?  I don't care.  I'm just pissed now.  Frank.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Who's Scarhead?  Scarhead is a crappy band.  I believe they're from the city.  But they just blow.  They're horrible.  I know.  Look at that.  Chicks are humping.  She's getting 13-year-olds.  Let me tell you something, though.  That's what Crystal says.  Stop it.  Allegedly, she lost her virginity to the dude from Scarhead.  Lucky her.  All right.  Thank you.  Lucky her.  Thank you very much, man, for the information. 
[02:40:30]  I had a question about Rich Voss.  What?  Yeah, he sucks.  Is his hair plastic?  No, his hair's not plastic.  All right.  Thank you.  Scarhead, Ant.  I apologize to our fine listeners.  She's flaming out from Staten Island.  Says this twat calls up to brag about some dip.  That was...  Banged her on the floor of his garage?  That was like jumping on a chick, man.  They pull down the pants and a wiener pop out.  What was the deal with that, man?  That was just total confusion.  We just went off a cliff.  We had Pablo Francisco riffing and just rocking for us today. 
[02:41:00]  She's lying, and I don't believe this story.  And we end up with Scarhead.  Scarhead.  Scarhead.  Stinky.  Oh, the answer is Scarhead.  And the answer is Scarhead.  And these are the new droid...  All right, Ron and Fez will be coming to the studio next.  All right, let's take care of this, then.  Paul and Anthony show.  New York.  Dallas.  Chicago.  Philly.  Cleveland.  Columbus.  Sacramento.  San Francisco.  The empire is spreading. 
[02:41:30]  Conquer it, you bastards!  And E.  W.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  I love it.  I love the Sam Adams.  Mm-mm.  We drink it, yes.  Scarhead.  You want to try out Sam Adams' winter lager?  That's right.  I'm Samuel Adams.  I sound like Corinth the Frog.  Get my little brewing natural wheat barney in here.  He got Ben so screwed up.  He couldn't do the whole thing.  He can't go to rehab.  No, I love Samuel Adams.  It's a break brew.  Isn't it great? 
[02:42:00]  I love Samuel Adams.  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  Mm-mm.  They got the winter lager now.  Spiced.  Subtly spiced with fresh ginger.  Could you read this like the movie guy right there?  The subtly spiced part?  Subtly spiced with fresh ginger, cinnamon, and orms.  Sam Adams' winter lager is smooth, full-bodied, and satisfying.  A true winter classic coming to a theater near you.  There you go.  We love it here.  You're going to love it.  Pick up these Sam Adams' winter lager. 
[02:42:30]  That's right.  They're serving at Caroline's Comedy Club.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Pablo Francisco for having me today.  Thanks a lot for having me, man.  We got a new friend right in.  Sure.  Playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Go see him.  Hilarious.  Thanks for coming out, man.  It was fun goofing with you guys, man.  A lot of fun.  Definitely.  And, you know, come on down and see the show. 
[02:43:00]  If you guys are not too busy, come on down.  It's going to be up there.  And anybody near Times Square, come on, swing on to Caroline's.  And if you can't, come see my bald spot on the back of my head on PabloFrancisco.com.  One man, one desire.  Get ready for all the action.  One man who talks like this forever.  Remember, I couldn't be a doctor.  Because if he asked me, Doc, how are you doing?  You're going to die.  Oh, man.  Can you imagine?  Hey, look who I am.  I'm looking here. 
[02:43:30]  Who just walked into the studio.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  We would have been here earlier.  Foundry Music Steve stopped us down the hall.  Pablo gets to walk right in.  We get stopped.  Look at the callback.  I love it.  Well, he's had a security there, Fezzy.  Ron, what were you doing all day that no one could contact you?  We're taking care of stuff, buddy.  We're taking care of stuff.  Big news.  Big news is coming up.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Big news.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Are you going to become a sports guy?  Is that the news?  That's like hearing you just got cancer.  That's going to be a new promo, I hear.  That's like saying, is it malignant?  That's what they say.  Malignant.  Well, it is the same as saying you've got three months.  Right.  The same thing.  Put your affairs in order.  Morning.  You're a sports guy.  Sports guy.  Although, Fez is now Pharrell Fez, whatever the hell that means.  Is that it?  I don't know why.  We like Scott Pharrell. 
[02:44:30]  We love it.  Whatever works for you.  I haven't met him yet.  We like this sports guy combo.  There's a combo now?  Yeah.  There's always a combo.  There's always a combo.  You're always just changing the numbers a little bit.  I like the Scotty Pharrell in the same way I'd like to watch a small child play with a loaded gun.  Because you know someday he's just going to kill himself with itself.  The best advice.  Yeah, right.  And you enjoy that.  It's fun to watch.  If you like him, the best advice is never take a vacation, Scott.  You know, Blaine's going, you know, I don't really need any time off. 
[02:45:00]  I'm fine.  How surprised was Blaine he took two weeks off for Christmas and had a job when he came  back.  Right.  Blaine was in your Christmas morning looking around.  Everything okay?  Is it cool?  Merry Christmas.  Yeah, the sports guys thing.  We were discussing that yesterday.  Oh, Pablo's leaving because you don't want to deal with this.  You don't want to deal with this.  I've got to shower and scrub my quacky quack.  The quacky quack.  Are we going to watch the football machine go down?  You've got to scrub my quacky quack.  Did you feel like you shouldn't hang?  No.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:45:30]  When's your show?  Eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock?  Oh, you have plenty of time.  That's right down the road.  Seven blocks away.  Yeah.  It's rock and roll.  So, Ron?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me get this straight.  You get a beautiful collector's item from Alto's.  Oh, he collects stuff like this.  Oh, yeah.  I've got that thing.  I've got a Robotron.  That thing is...  My Robotron's worth $2,000.  I love Robotron.  That's the thing.  Now, this, when I walked in there, that's like Captain Fantastic at Elton John's.  Right.  Only $1,000 made.  Well, we're here in $5,700. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, is that right?  But who's counting?  And I just saw on eBay, there's one of those available in better condition for that $570.  Oh, I heard $3,000.  What happened to the $3,000?  How are you talking it up?  It's like the engagement ring all of a sudden turns out to be a cubic zirconium.  And a certificate proving that it's fake.  Well, no matter what we do, I say we sell it if you don't like it.  We're all for $1,200.  Ain't about it.  $1,200.  It's not about the money.  Why don't we do this?  And then all the proceeds go to a half ounce of Coke that we can relax to.  It's going to be okay, okay? 
[02:46:30]  Let me tell you something.  It's going to be great, okay?  Pablo Escobar.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Pablo Escobar.  That's when radio was great when you could just sell one of those guitars off the air.  That's some Coke.  Listen, I'm serious.  Just take it, and then I'll get back to you with the rest of the money.  That's Clapton's guitar!  That's Clapton's!  You've got to write a book, too.  Yeah, right.  Well, no, it's not about the money.  It's about breaking his heart.  See, this is the thing.  This is what it's all about. 
[02:47:00]  Al Dukes is, I've said this, in love with Opie.  Let's not candy coat this.  He's in love with the man.  Right.  And it's a little disturbing.  No, it's true, though.  It is!  He pictures Opie up on top of that pinball machine like it was Jodie Foster.  Jodie Foster and the accused.  Oh, awful.  What?  There we are.  Now we sit and...  Well, it's yours to do whatever you want with.  That's the way I sit. 
[02:47:30]  Well, I'm sure he'll replace it with something much more lavish if you destroy this one.  Ron Corleone, I'm asking you, if you're going to do these things.  No one came to me.  There was a kid who brought in a pinball machine.  When it was smashed, I didn't go looking.  I didn't ask any questions.  Because this is the business we've chose.  No, you've got to do what you've got to do, Opie.  I'm just showing respect.  That is respect.  That's total respect.  I don't want to smash the machine. 
[02:48:00]  You're going to keep bringing me back in.  Ron Corleone.  It's up to you.  I mean, do you think you'll feel better smashing a collectible pinball machine?  He always feels better when he smashes people's gifts.  I'm just afraid we're not going to get anything ever again.  Because every time...  All right, hold on.  Remember Anthony Limo guy brought in the Jets gumball machine?  Right.  Nice.  Smash.  It was a stupid bobbly head.  Stalker Patty, everything she brings in.  Smash.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Remember when Rascals gave us the Louis XIII scotch? 
[02:48:30]  The cognac.  Cognac, whatever?  Yeah.  Nice.  Didn't smash that.  No.  I love when Caroline's and people bring the really expensive champagne by.  Nice.  It's got to be expensive.  Yeah, right.  Well, the cheap stuff.  Come on.  We all know.  And then we get some bottles of wine from time to time.  Know what I got today that I'm fully enjoying and will not smash?  What?  A Kurt Cobain poster from the fine folks down there in Philly at WYSP.  The Kurt and Corby.  Movie poster.  On our wall.  Nice.  So I don't break everything. 
[02:49:00]  Isn't it an after poster?  Was he laying there on the ground?  Is it just the feet?  You know the feet, Shaolin?  You know you're going to get the calls now.  Dude, shut up.  You know, he was a genius, man.  Dick.  I just don't like...  I just don't like the talent he had in his penis.  I just don't like kiss asses.  He's kissing ass.  He's just ridiculous.  I know in his heart he thought that you were just going to say, okay, Al.  Right.  This was unbelievable.  This is what I said.  Man, you should hang. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  He thought this was going to turn into, Al, man, you know, we had our thing.  Or maybe even that opiate would go, ah, it's been a bit, you know.  I just wanted to go, but I really want you to know I appreciate the pinball machine.  Everything's great.  Now open mouth, kiss me.  You know?  That's how he feels.  I can tell.  The guy is attracted to you.  Right.  The guy talks in terms of relationships.  He used that word.  The relationship with Opie.  He wants to hang out.  They'll laugh about this over beers when they're hanging. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, what?  He asked your girlfriend about you, like what kind of things you like to do.  What he's like off the air.  Well, that really put it over the top when he's asking my girlfriend, well, how is he  like off the air?  Yeah.  See, I think the strategy is.  He's not in business.  He buys you a big enough gift that he has to help you move it to home.  Oh, is that it?  That he gets to see your house.  I think late at night he's looking out his window like Fiebel, just wondering what the  hell you're up to.  Ah.  He's glancing.  Somewhere out there. 
[02:50:30]  He's just gazing towards Long Island.  What's your high score?  I know he's doing something.  That's how he feels about you, though.  Is he all uncomfortable in the back office?  Yeah.  Oh, we're reenacting the mailroom thing.  Have to.  Yeah.  The Carole Miller mailroom.  Keep him in the mailroom.  Until Opie passes by him.  That really happened for about six months around here.  I got no problem with that.  It was the only way to separate certain radio hosts from each other.  What are we doing?  Make him say goodbye to his machine.  Oh, God.  Make him say goodbye to it. 
[02:51:00]  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye.  Make him say goodbye, dude.  On the unit.  Make him say I'm going to miss you to Mick Jagger.  Rick, you got a mic?  Go outside the studio.  He's not coming in the studio.  What?  I was thinking maybe we get him on the phone along with the guy he got it from and explain  to him what's going to happen.  That's a little logistically kooky.  Grab him and make him come down.  Where did he get the pinball from?  Because I don't want that guy to suffer.  Classic Pinball Corporation.  Oh, they're great, by the way. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Classic Pinball Corporation.  Classic Pinball Corporation.  They're incorporated now, you know.  Classic Pinball.com.  You've got to check this stuff out.  Classic Pinball.com.  I think they were going to give us the Space Invaders, but I don't see that happening.  Oh, see, now you've got my soft spot.  They're going great.  We'll bring it down.  What time does Opie want to take a dump on it?  Thank you very much.  Classic Pinball.com, 973-345-3944.  That's worth at least $1,000 on our show. 
[02:52:00]  So they can't be picked up.  Yeah.  Go get Al.  No, don't bring him in here.  Not in here.  Let him stand outside.  It's really uncomfortable.  It's embarrassing.  Just make him stand in the corner over there, like in the Blair Witch Project.  He has to stand in the corner as Opie kills the machine.  With his back to the pinball machine.  With his back to the machine.  So he just hears the horrible sounds of it.  All right, have him lay down, and he doesn't know whether the pinball machine is going  to get hit or him.  Don't give Opie that choice.  We'll be playing pinball after it's all done. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, if he...  And you'll finally get your new producer.  If you can kneecap him, then don't break the machine.  Oh, a little hobbling.  So what are we doing?  Is he...  He's on the phone.  Oh, is this Al Dukes?  Yes, it is.  Where are you?  I'm in one of the production rooms.  Oh, why don't you...  Are you staring at us right now?  Are you watching Opie?  No, I'm in a closed office.  I'm watching you through the glass, Opie.  I'm in a closed office.  You know where you are. 
[02:53:00]  A game.  Yeah.  You're holding the phone with one hand, and what are you doing with the other as you  gaze at the man you love?  No, I'm not attracted to Opie.  Yeah, I'd show him.  Oh, really?  No.  You sure know how to show it.  It was just...  I brought a nice gesture.  Do you understand that's a nice gesture reserved for couples, maybe, that have been in  love?  Maybe a guy is a collector of these things, and his wife scrapes up money for years to  afford something like this, and you just get it for Opie for what?  For what?  As a gesture to say, hey. 
[02:53:30]  A gesture gift...  Let's make love.  ...is a bottle.  A bottle of maybe Captain Morgan rum.  Here's a good gesture.  It's like, here, it mixes well with Coke.  Here you go.  Both kinds.  But a good gesture...  Guys don't buy other guys' stuff.  Especially stuff like that.  Did this fantasy of yours end with Opie taking a baseball bat to the present?  Did this come into your equation anywhere?  No, I don't have any fantasies about Opie.  I was just making a nice gesture, just, hey, whatever... 
[02:54:00]  To make your relationship better?  To make your relationship with him better?  A work relationship.  I'll say this, but first he asked me if Opie skied.  He wanted to get him skis.  Now, that's strange.  Were you talking about skis?  Are you...  No, he goes, does he Opie ski?  I go, I don't know.  You know how personal...  Because I like to get him skis...  He wanted to get you any sort of athletic wear.  Yeah, some kind of vest he wanted to get you.  Skis are such a personal item.  Really is.  Go to Aspen and have a little romantic ski party.  Yeah, you want to go to Aspen with him?  A little ski party. 
[02:54:30]  Aspen.  Aspen.  I said, I said it.  Kevin.  Yeah, I'm here.  From ClassicPinball.com.  That's me.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi.  Hey, Al, look who's on the phone.  Hey, Kev.  Hey, Al, how are you doing?  It's your dealer.  What are they going to do?  Well, it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, this is...  Looking grim.  Looking grim, huh?  Do you have repairs over there?  Want to make out?  We do extensive repairs.  Yeah, you might have to.  Extensive.  I think we should just save the pieces, maybe, and sell them off, you know, one piece of glass 
[02:55:00]  at a time.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's getting out.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez, no.  Oh, he's getting out.  He's slow.  Oh, no.  He's getting out.  He's getting out.  Now, that thing's worth a lot of money, right?  It is.  Okay.  Oh, Pete.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Tell the answer to run.  Everyone's kind of running away from the area.  What a difference a day makes.  Okay, now, oh, my camera.  Oh, my God.  Everybody was happy yesterday.  Now.  Oh, God. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Hold on here.  Did you guys restore that pinball machine?  Was it wrecked?  Oh, boy.  It was pretty trash.  Nothing worked.  Keith used to do rails off the top of it.  Are the decals the same as the originals?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right.  He's got the sledgehammer.  Oh, my God.  Hey, all I got to tell you.  Who's going to mic this?  Maybe someone should shield their frigging eyes.  I predict Opie cutting his wrist. 
[02:56:00]  I don't think he's going to do it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Look, look, man.  It is.  Dude, it's a classic.  Don't.  Oh, he almost fell off the chair.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's like a movie from Christine.  No, no, no.  He's got it.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  It took like a year to find that thing.  Watch this.  Where's Al?  Make Al watch.  Wait a minute.  They're pulling him out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  They're pulling him out, Opie. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, Al, give us the Rambo First Blood 2.  He got you this thing out of the goodness of his heart.  This is just going to be like that scene in Rocky 3 where Pauly throws the bottle right  through the pinball machine.  Oh, look at his face.  Oh, no.  I mean, this is what you want to do.  There's Al.  Hey, Al.  Hey, Opie, I dare you to smash it.  It's so sad.  There's your voice.  It's so sad.  With the mallard.  I dare you.  This is so cool.  I mean, I just got it as a gesture.  Hey, Al, will you accept Visa, MasterCard?  Business relationship thing.  Oh, my boy.  Oh, my God.  I can't stop it.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[02:57:00]  No.  Oh, my God.  It's gone.  Oh, no, no.  The football table.  Look out.  See, did you hear that?  There's pinball collectors throwing themselves out windows.  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:57:30]  That's copyrighted material.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  Dude, he completely didn't think you were going to do that.  He totally should not believe you were really going to do that.  That's what I think of your gift, and that's what I think of you.  Oh, God.  There is a mess out there.  Make him clean it up.  It looks like a car wreck.  Make him clean it up.  You can't even tell what it was.  No.  No. 
[02:58:00]  It looks like James Dean's car.  Save the pieces.  He said save the pieces.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There are no pieces left.  Hit the flipper, then hit Mick Jagger right in the groin, and he disappears.  Now, do you have a kiss machine?  Maybe you'd like kiss.  Oh, God.  No kiss.  No kiss.  You want a kiss machine?  No.  No.  Don't send anything.  Why don't you just hit it with a hammer over there?  Probably a better idea.  Yeah.  Just break it there.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe the sound of that.  I'm going to look at it. 
[02:58:30]  That's what I think.  All right.  Well, we'll see you Monday.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez here in New York.  Pablo Francisco.  It'll be third at all to park the van.  Pablo Francisco at Caroline's all this weekend.  I don't think he's ever coming back.  Pablo, will you come back?  The warranty just expired.  I can't believe you guys did that.  I might be right.  It was fun.  I want to get a girl at flash stage.  Uh-oh.  What's happening now?  Rick is taking shots.  Oh, well, geez.  It's already been done.  There's nothing else you can do to it.  Classic Pinball.com. 
[02:59:00]  Thank you, Kevin.  Come to Caroline's.  Come see the show.  Thanks for everything, guys.  And Ron and Fez up next.  Cleaning up glass.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  See you Monday. </pre>
