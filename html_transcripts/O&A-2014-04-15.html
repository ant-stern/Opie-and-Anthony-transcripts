<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, which heavily featured the news of comedian Otto Peterson's death.  The pre-show also covered a variety of other topics, including the controversial business model of the Cronut maker, Anthony's bizarre dream involving a cellophane-wrapped woman smelling of urine (analyzed with reference to a therapist, Steve), a news clip of a Minnesota hockey riot, a phone call from Bob Levy reacting emotionally to Otto's death, speculation about Brett Michaels' wig, and jokes about Tax Day.  Plans were announced for Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine to appear on the main show to share memories of Otto, alongside other callers.  The pre-show also mentioned upcoming events, including "The Unmasked" show.

The main show opened with a heated discussion about New York's SAFE Act, with Opie and Anthony expressing strong opposition and anger towards the gun registration law.  Callers, including Elio from upstate New York and Bob from Tucson (a former law enforcement officer), engaged in passionate—and often combative—debates about gun control, individual rights, and the law's perceived loopholes.  The segment then shifted to a humorous discussion about a lunar eclipse photo, accusations against Roland, a show personality, and rumors of Kevin Costner avoiding the studio.  Pharrell Williams' success and a video of him crying on Oprah were also discussed, provoking emotional responses from the hosts.  The segment concluded with a discussion of music and a brief mention of a gruesome Taliban violence video. Jim Florentine was again mentioned as an upcoming guest.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to remembering Otto and George, with in-studio guests Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine contributing numerous anecdotes about the comedians' careers, including their early days, performances at various comedy clubs (like Pips and the Varsity Pub), their comedic style (described as shocking and offensive), and their personal lives.  The segment included many offensive jokes and sexually explicit discussions, interspersed with commercial breaks.

More commercials followed, including ads for Zoom e-cigarettes, Cheapo Air, Adam & Eve, Smart Mouth mouthwash, and a particularly aggressive and suggestive Steven Singer Jewelers ad.  Hulk Hogan promoted a West Coast encore of the show.  This led to a discussion of a flight attendant’s experiences with difficult passengers, then a conversation about technology with Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine, also featuring mentions of David Copperfield's upcoming call to discuss Otto and George, and the upcoming 20th-anniversary show at Caroline's.  The hosts argued about the show’s length and logistics, including poster signings.  A significant portion then focused on Samsung phones and watches, the hosts' "white glove treatment" from the company, and wireless charging technology. David Copperfield's call followed, sharing anecdotes about his friendship with Otto and showing a video of his puppet collection which included Otto's George puppet.  More memories and stories about Otto and George’s act, punctuated by jokes and profanity, followed, concluding with announcements of upcoming shows and appearances, including Jim Florentine’s and Opie’s, along with final advertisements.


Finally, a segment featured Auto (presumably a comedian) recounting his recent hospitalization for bacterial meningitis following an inner ear infection.  He described his eight-day hospital stay, including memory loss and vivid, surreal dreams (being shot, riding a train with rodeo clowns, encountering Frank Sinatra).  He detailed his combative airport behavior before hospitalization and experiences within the hospital, including a roommate with severe motorcycle injuries and inadequate pain medication.  The conversation moved on to anecdotes about his hospital experiences, performing at a strip club, and detailed reminiscences about Abbott and Costello, including Costello's boxing prowess and the abuse he suffered from Abbott.  The hosts discussed old Hollywood, Lou Costello's son's death, Jerry Red Wilson's death from meningitis, classic monster movies, and Richard Kuklinski, interspersed with several commercial breaks and discussions about acting styles.

[00:02:30]  Trust me, it feels very good.  It'll give you that nice boost to begin the day.  We always talk about not only what's going to happen today, but a lot about what happened  yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show.  And, of course, we're going to get into what happened with Otto and what the plan for today's  show is in terms of covering that.  And we got some clips about how we dealt with that yesterday.  We found out our friend Otto Peterson had passed away yesterday.  In the middle of the show, just a great guy, great comedian. 
[00:03:00]  And we'll talk about him in a little bit.  But I did want to highlight some of the other stuff that happened on yesterday's show before  we got into that.  Because it was a very funny show.  We got back into the Cronut guy.  Now, the Cronut guy has been a topic on the Opie and Anthony show as of late.  Because he has created this Cronut empire.  Everybody's talking about it all the time.  Everybody wants to see what it's all about. 
[00:03:30]  And he will not expose it to the masses.  And what's happening is, you know, the Board of Health, he's got one restaurant.  He's got his one little bakery.  And so the Board of Health is apparently trying to screw with him.  That's what Roland says.  Because they're trying to screw with him, for whatever reason, trying to keep him down.  And they know that he's just got the one bakery.  So all they've got to do is make it so that he can't do his business in that bakery. 
[00:04:00]  And he's out of business.  I mean, we were talking yesterday, and the guys were right on, about what he should be  doing with his Cronuts.  Enough with the integrity at this point.  It's gotten past the point of making sure the quality is just so.  So let's not, this thing has gotten bigger than any one person.  So let's expose it.  Oh, and Award got into it yesterday.  Let's go to track three, Sal.  I've met Dominic a few times now.  He's the greatest guy.  And his stuff is amazing.  It's over-the-top delicious. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  It really is better than most things you're going to get in New York City.  But he frustrates the hell out of me.  Just stop with this.  Today, I'm going to make 21.  21 Cronuts.  That's it.  That's it, huh?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  That should be in Costco.  Just boxes of it stacked up.  What do you need?  I need a case of Cronuts.  So many boxes stacked up that they're just throwing them in the dumpster in the back  because of the expiration date.  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  You know what I mean?  Just gluttony.  There should be so many Cronuts.  There should be, on how it's made, the Cronut.  Of course.  On that show, how it's made.  And just show these machines.  Just spitting fucking Cronuts.  Cronuts flying out the other end.  Because in the end, he can make a lot more.  What is he doing?  What's he doing?  Nice conveyor belt where it's just...  Oh, man.  They're flying out.  And then a big tractor trailer full leaves the plant. 
[00:05:30]  Get to see the packaging of the Cronuts.  Oh, yeah.  Bunch of Mexican people with hairnets on.  Right.  Fucking working it.  Right.  And he doesn't even know.  They're like, I haven't even been to all the Cronut factories around the country.  But today, I'm going to make 13 Cronuts.  Yeah.  Oh.  A special Cronut today.  Oh, please.  You dunce.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  What is he doing?  As he watches every other store have their Cronuts. 
[00:06:00]  They all have Cronuts, and they're passing them by.  I mean, they're right.  At this point, you should be able to buy genuine Cronuts by the palate if you want to.  Like, every low-income mall across the country should have some kind of Cronut stand.  You know what I mean?  Like, every airport should have a Cronut stand.  It's ridiculous.  Why not make the money while it's there?  Let's go to Snowy in Michigan.  Snowy, welcome to the pre-show. 
[00:06:30]  Samuel, how are you doing today, sir?  Good.  Not a great day with auto-passing.  It really sucks.  Yeah, it really does.  Too many of these frickin' comedians are...  Anyway, you know, they're attacking this guy's integrity about, you know, making only 13 Cronuts and whatnot.  They're going to upset Roland, and they're never going to have this guy on there giving him Cronuts.  Well, I don't even...  I don't think that they're making fun of the Cronut guy as much as we're all perplexed as to why he's just leaving money on the table. 
[00:07:00]  Well, that's kind of attacking...  I mean, not attacking, but it's kind of, you know, pretty good question is, you know, they're going to say,  I know for this integrity crap, just start mad producing these things, you know?  Look, there's no doubt that this Cronut guy is a genius chef.  He's a masterful baker.  But he is not a strong businessman.  Nope, apparently not.  I don't think so.  Thanks, Snowy.  Take care, Dave.  And that's not a shot against him.  We can't all be good at everything.  Guess what?  I'm not a great baker.  I'm okay with admitting it. 
[00:07:30]  I'm not great at most things, but I'm sure I'll find something at some point.  We also got into Ant's dream.  This is one of those things I love when Ant has something that he'll get into that's not like a...  I mean, you know, he covers the news well.  But when he can get into his personal life or something that just happened to him...  And you know what's in his head.  He's just waiting for a moment.  When there's a lull in the conversation, he comes out with something that just busts the whole room open. 
[00:08:00]  And that's what he did yesterday when he brought up his dream.  Let's go to track four.  I was hanging out with this girl.  She was supposed to come meet me.  And she was wrapped in cellophane.  She was wrapped in cellophane.  She's like, usually I only wrap my head and feet in cellophane.  But I figured I'd wrap my whole self up.  And she smelled like piss because of the sweat from the cellophane.  You could smell in your dreams?  Yeah.  I don't think I could smell in my dreams.  She smelled all pissy because she was sweating in the cellophane. 
[00:08:30]  What the fuck am I doing?  I don't know.  But I'm trying to figure out what could it mean when a girl smells like your own because she's wrapped in cellophane.  Cellophane.  Certainly not a condom reference.  Yeah, right?  Uh-oh.  Name another set.  Another set is a house, a certain house where there's a, it's like a ranch house.  It's got a fireplace, got a front and a back door with the windows and the windows, if I look out them. 
[00:09:00]  Can you see the rising sun?  No, I see there's always like bad people out there.  Oh.  Bad people trying to get in.  And my gun never works in dreams.  Never!  It's just fucking, I have the wrong ammo.  No, the trigger won't pull.  Or I got pulled trigger so hard that the fucking, the bullet, I'm not aiming properly.  Oh, Kenny?  I used to have a dream like that too, and that's common for cops to have.  Is it? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, like I'd be.  But I'm not a cop, you idiot.  Walking up the stairs in a project.  Yeah.  And the door would open, the guy would be there with a shotgun, and I'd draw and pull the trigger and nothing happens.  Oh, that's like the worst.  And then you wake up, because if you don't wake up, that means you get killed.  Oh, right.  It's because it's a dream.  Sure, you wake up and you realize that you're at a place having your sperm tested, and you're shooting blanks, yes.  Fear of impotence. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, yes.  See, I'm surprised that Kenny even has dreams, because he doesn't display a lot of brain activity on a day-to-day basis.  So you would think that in order to have a dream, you'd have to be a more thoughtful person.  I don't know for sure.  I don't exactly know how dreams work.  But it's always interesting, because we all have that weird stress dream.  And I don't know if it's like, maybe it takes time, like whatever you're doing now, if you do it for a certain number of years, that becomes the stress dream. 
[00:10:30]  Because I still have like high school and college stress dreams.  And I've been out of school for 10 years.  Maybe it's because I haven't had a real job.  I've just been doing this nonsense the whole time.  But we had Steve the therapist on the phone to kind of get into Ant's dream and shrink his head a little bit.  Let's move on to track five.  I find that Antony's dreams generally project his thinly-veiled, profound contempt for women.  Oh, yeah?  You have a lot of violent dreams, a lot of rape dreams. 
[00:11:00]  No, not a lot of rape dreams.  You misunderstood what I said.  Maybe you just talked about it.  No, it's dream rape, but it doesn't happen a lot.  But if it does happen, like if I realize that I'm dreaming, because a lot of times, not a lot of times, sometimes, if I'm dreaming, I'll all of a sudden go like, holy shit, I'm dreaming.  But still be asleep and in the dream.  And then I'll be like, yeah, and just go on a rampage.  And I will grab any dream girl that's around me and just fucking rip her clothes off and stick it in her. 
[00:11:30]  But you're a rarity, because as soon as you realize you're dreaming and you're like, oh, wow, I'm dreaming and this is a cool dream, as soon as you acknowledge that in some subconscious way, it always changes your dream into something else.  Or you wake up.  How are you able to actually control it?  That's why I jump on it so fast, because I think if I'm going to do some slow finessing and, oh, let me do this, the dream's either going to change or I'll wake up.  I panic and I go, oh, it's a dream, quick, rape. 
[00:12:00]  I'm a goody two-shoes in my dreams.  No, you've got to be crazy.  But how do you get to that point?  I don't know.  It just happens.  How?  Because he has the same type of dreams, despite the fact he's saying he doesn't.  I've got the same morals in my dreams.  Bullshit.  Well, I do, too, if I don't know I'm dreaming.  If I don't know I'm dreaming, I've missed out on a lot of dream pussy by fucking being Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, and then I wake up and go, why the fuck didn't you just fucking do it? 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Because you didn't realize you were dreaming.  I didn't realize I was dreaming.  I was trying to be a nice guy when I should just be rapey guy.  When I should just be rapey guy.  It is amazing that Ant is able to control his dreams like that.  But, and I've had this conversation with him on the air before, I really feel like it says a lot about morals.  On some level, I think that if you realize you're in a dream, and then you rape because it's allowed, that there's some part of you that if it weren't outlawed, and if it were a little more socially acceptable, 
[00:13:00]  you may consider raping.  I think that that's what that says.  I mean, I'm not a Steve the Therapist guy.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  But I think there's something to it.  Let's go to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  What's up, Jimmy James?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Morning, Sam.  Morning.  Hey, quickly jumping back onto Dominic, the Cronut guy.  Yeah.  My main concern about how the boys have been talking to him is they're going to deprive us, the listener, of one of our favorite bits, and that's hearing them eat Cronuts on the radio. 
[00:13:30]  That's true.  I mean, and that's something that you guys have to be upset about, that they may be taking away a food break if we can't get the Cronut guy in here soon.  Let's move on to what I thought was the funnest news clip of the day.  I don't think it's going to get any funner than this news clip this entire week.  This went down in Minnesota.  We played it yesterday. 
[00:14:00]  You can find the video on our Twitter, at O&A Show, or on our Facebook, which is also O&A Show.  In Minnesota, the college team lost the NCAA championships in hockey.  So the news reporter, the local Fox affiliate news reporter, went out and tried to do some man-on-the-street stuff, and the drunken white kids would not leave him alone.  Let's play track seven, Sal. 
[00:14:30]  Jonathan, go ahead.  Tim, we're hearing shots right now.  I don't think they're gunned.  I think it sounds like pellet guns right now.  A lot of people running down the street.  We saw another group of students run down this way.  We're not sure.  Get off me.  Tim, I've got to send it back to you live.  A lot of people here drunk right now running down the street.  That's the news reporter going, get off me.  We fucking won.  Get off me.  We're not sure.  Get off me. 
[00:15:00]  Tim, I've got to send it back to you live.  A lot of people here drunk right now running down the street.  This is a chaotic scene.  I've got to send it back to you soon.  Yeah, no worries, Jonathan.  No worries.  No worries.  No worries.  We're going to take you back up to Sky Fox now.  As you see, two squad cars heading west down the fourth.  All of you who went to the U know that is a very...  They're going to go ahead and go back to John.  John's probably like, okay, I got it back.  Come back to me.  And look at these kids already.  He's waiting.  All revved up.  To pounce.  You can tell that they're leaving him alone. 
[00:15:30]  And then the minute he starts talking, they all just go over to him.  Popular place.  He's there live right now.  Jonathan, set the scene for us.  You've got officers walking past you.  Tim, look at the riot police right now.  They are moving on 13th Avenue trying to get students out of the streets.  Again, after the game, people, the students inside the bar seem to be leaving in an orderly fashion.  But then we started to see people running, shot and fired.  The guy's flicking his tongue like he's licking.  Now the riot police out here in full force coming out in teams building walls right now. 
[00:16:00]  Tim, I've got to send it back to you.  You see them all grabbing him by the shoulder and jumping up and down.  They're jumping up and down with their hands on the guy's shoulders.  He's being annoying.  He's there fucking all cranky.  He is so annoyed right now.  The one guy's mimicking eating pussy.  Yeah.  Look at his tongue.  I really would recommend seeing that video if you haven't already.  Again, it's up on O&A Show on Twitter.  Let's move on to Lou in New Jersey.  Lou, welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, Sammy.  Good morning. 
[00:16:30]  Good morning, buddy.  Just wanted to compliment you guys and the great Bob Levy for the job you did keeping Otto's memory alive.  Well, yeah, I mean, that, of course, was breaking yesterday.  Thanks, Lou.  We found out while the show was on the air, Jim had to excuse himself because he got a phone call.  And then we kind of went to break in a weird way because it was obviously a very emotional thing for Jim to have to deal with.  But we found out that Otto Peterson passed away yesterday. 
[00:17:00]  Of course, Otto from Otto and George, who have been doing the show for years, but even more importantly, has been doing comedy with Jim for even longer.  I mean, they came up together.  Otto is just such a nice dude.  Like, he came on and he said the most disgusting, revolting things that were among the funniest things that have been said on the show.  He was one of the best one-liner guys to ever come on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:30]  But more importantly, he was just a nice dude.  Like, he was a nice, sweet man.  And not only off the air, but you could hear it if you'd listened to him on the air when he wasn't making vile jokes.  You could hear the sweetness in his voice.  And this is a guy who was in show business forever.  I mean, he was a street performer from the time he was a teenager in New York City, rubbing elbows with, I mean, the most amazing people.  So many great stories. 
[00:18:00]  But we found out about this yesterday.  And we'll be talking about this a lot today.  I think we're going to have some comedians come in studio today.  Bob Kelly will be here.  Jim Florentine may be here.  You know, comedians have a weird schedule, but we're trying at the last minute to bring in some people to kind of talk about their memories of Otto.  And I think some of the people who he affected their lives will be calling into the show as well.  So we'll have a lot of people talking about this today.  But I wanted to play yesterday's clip when we kind of made the announcement. 
[00:18:30]  Let's go to track nine.  Sorry about that.  Well, it's completely reasonable.  Jesus.  Yeah, I got a call.  What happened?  I didn't.  That wasn't a radio tease.  I got a call from Jim Florentine.  I knew it was bad news because he wouldn't call me on the air.  Yeah, you ran out of here.  I knew something was up.  And Otto died.  And I just I just couldn't say it when I came back.  Yeah, I just I didn't.  Obviously, it's always hard to say that.  But I just I physically couldn't say it. 
[00:19:00]  So I wrote it down, but it wasn't to be mysterious.  So I know it wasn't some stupid tease.  I don't know what he died of.  Apparently, he had taken a nap and just didn't wake up.  Jeez, he was 53.  That's pretty bad.  It's terrible.  Fuck.  We've we've known him a long time.  You've known him forever.  Fucking comics.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Fucking believable.  I don't know if it was tied into what had happened where he was in the hospital for a while. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, he was in the hospital last year.  Was it for a while?  Almost.  Was it almost a year ago or something?  Meningitis of some sort, yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So I guess his girlfriend was calling people.  And this was just the first I heard of it.  Fuck.  It's just heartbreaking.  Look.  No shit.  Wow.  Me.  That just out of nowhere.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  That shit just blindsides you.  He was a funny fucking guy, man.  Oh.  I mean, we always say that about people when they die off court.  Yeah.  But Otto was a funny fucking guy.  Yeah, I don't think so.  No one made me laugh harder than him.  No one.  I don't get that.  As a guy.  And that's what a lot of comics have been saying.  That very...  And Jim has talked about this on the show before.  Comedians don't really laugh very often.  Because, I mean, they're in the business of humor.  So they don't sit there laughing. 
[00:20:30]  They acknowledge that things are funny.  They acknowledge they appreciate humor.  But they don't laugh that much.  And Otto always, always made comedians that were in here laugh.  It was an amazing, amazing thing to see.  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, good morning, Sam.  Good morning.  Hey, I just heard the press conference from George about Otto's death.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was real short. 
[00:21:00]  All he had to say was that he was speechless.  All right.  Develop that one a little bit and come back to it.  So if I had to read one more tweet from somebody saying,  Oh, I wonder if George will be able to continue.  It's like, we get it.  He had a puppet.  Okay?  Understood.  Thank you, everybody.  Let's go to Jeff in Delaware.  What's up, Jeff?  Not much, man.  I was just calling to say, I don't know.  It wasn't the last caller anymore.  But one guy said, Bob Levy.  I don't know.  When he called, he was just dredging on and on and using that verbal clutch. 
[00:21:30]  Or crutch.  What was it all?  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  After every word.  And then he kept bringing himself into it.  I was yelling at the radio for him to just hang up on him.  Thanks, Jeff.  I understand he was upset.  Right, right, right.  It's amazing, though.  Jeff, you bring up a good point.  It's amazing how polarizing Bob Levy is.  You either love that guy like the, you know, caller two calls ago.  He said, you know, he loved hearing Bob Levy's memories of Otto.  It is amazing how polarizing Bob Levy is. 
[00:22:00]  That even when he's calling up to remember his friend, there are still people that just  don't want to hear this guy.  I mean, I guess that's good.  When you can generate a reaction like that out of people, it's either love or hate with  Bob Levy.  If you want to call the pre-show right now, by the way, we still have some time to take  some calls.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And let's play the Bob Levy call that everybody either hated or loved and appreciated. 
[00:22:30]  Bobby.  Yeah.  I just got the call just now, and I'm just shocked, man.  I mean, we were friends for like 20-something years, and, you know, he finally got his life  together.  And for this to happen, you know, we were just talking last week about stories from what  we used to do when we were crazy, and we're like, I can't believe we're still alive.  And, you know, I don't know what happened, you know? 
[00:23:00]  Right.  It's just like, it just blows me away that just one after another.  I mean, we're going down, you know, it's like fucking wrestlers have shit like a comedian.  What the fuck are you just telling jokes, you know?  And it's just like, this really hit me, man.  And we were going to hang out.  We, you know, in a week or two, we were going to Florida for a gig.  And he goes, let's stay a few days and hang out and have a good time and get some sun. 
[00:23:30]  And I was like, yeah, man, that sounds great.  And it's just like fucking unbelievable because, you know, he is, he was a legend in his business  and always will be known as that.  And that's got to be kept up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He may have been more underground than most people, but there, a lot of, most of the people  that are underground are better than you see on TV.  So.  Right.  When you pop up on other comics, favorite comic lists, you know, like he was. 
[00:24:00]  He was always, he was on a lot of people's lists.  When you talk to comics about who was fucking hilariously funny, fucking I don't know.  Right.  You know?  Bob, how was he doing lately?  I mean, he was on our show, I don't know, not that long ago and he looked great.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he would call, he called me up and he goes, it had right to have a couple beers, right?  You know?  And I was like, you know, you don't need to drink.  I mean, but, you know, he just wanted to sit in the yard, you know? 
[00:24:30]  And, like, he was basically sober.  He was off the coke, you know?  I mean, and I just hope it's not, you know, people fall back.  I just, you know what I mean?  I just hope he went peaceful.  Now, and that's what we all hope.  As far as any of us know, he was clean.  I mean, last time we saw Otto, he was healthy, he looked good.  So we don't know what happened yet still.  I know a lot of people are wondering and trying to find out. 
[00:25:00]  We don't have that information yet.  I'm sure we'll get it.  And when we do, we'll share that with you.  Let's go to Wayne in Missouri.  Welcome to the pre-show, Wayne.  Hey, just wanted to say, this is a damn good pre-show.  I subscribed a few months ago, and I'm, you know, from YouTube clips.  And just, the whole show is amazing.  Thank you so much for what you do.  Oh, well, thank you, Wayne.  Always good to hear.  Let's go to Ralph in Ohio.  Hey, Sammy. 
[00:25:30]  Do you think Nancy Grace will have a show about nine comedians?  I'm sure.  I mean, news, you know, we talked about Nancy Grace with Dan Soder on Friday.  The news broke yesterday afternoon that the Ultimate Warrior died because he had heart disease.  He had a bad heart, which Nancy Grace attributed his death to steroids before, not only before there was a result of an autopsy, but before an autopsy was even done. 
[00:26:00]  So, yes, I'm sure if she can figure out a way to squeeze comedians into something that will get her a hashtag, she will do it.  Yeah, I think Belushi, Farley, I mean, some of the greatest comedians.  And then there's, I mean, that's just as many as the wrestlers as you can think about it.  I mean, that's what I was thinking.  Thanks, Ralph.  And we do talk about wrestler deaths a lot on the show, but, I mean, the comedians, it's just too much.  Especially comedians associated with this show.  It just keeps happening.  It's heartbreaking. 
[00:26:30]  But, yeah, speaking of comedians and Nancy Grace, Jim got blocked by Nancy Grace last night, finally.  Because I think Nancy Grace's Twitter hashtag that she was trying to trend was Box of Babies, based on the news case of a box of dead babies being found.  She was actually trying to trend hashtag Box of Babies.  She's a terrible, terrible person.  So I'm sure that Jim is going to talk about that later today. 
[00:27:00]  But as we talk about Otto and his passing, we just heard Bob Levy.  Joe DeRosa also called the show yesterday.  He had just woken up and heard what had happened.  He was reading tweets and stuff, and he didn't know.  So he called the show.  And this is the first time we've heard from Joe since he moved out to L.A. to work on the Pete Holmes show.  So, but here's DeRosa's reaction to the news.  I remember we did the nasty show at Just for Laughs one year.  And the two things I remember is, one, he did the Kennedy bit where the puppet gets shot and the brains come out. 
[00:27:30]  Like the Kennedy assassination.  And during it, he's going, they're shooting, Norton.  Yeah, yeah, they're shooting.  Put the top up, Norton.  Yeah, put the top up, Norton.  They're shooting at us.  So funny.  Went to a honeymoon.  Right.  Oh, shit.  That's so good, man.  And then I remember Patrice was on the shows, too.  It's so fucking sad, man. 
[00:28:00]  Jesus Christ.  But Patrice was on the shows, too.  And we were down, the theater we were in, the green room was downstairs under the stage.  And there was this long cinder block hallway.  So if anybody was coming down the hallway from the stage, you could hear it.  It was just echo.  And I remember Patrice was, Otto was on stage when I, and Patrice came walking down.  And Patrice's cackle was, like, cascading off the cinder block.  And he walks in the room, and I go, what's so funny, man?  And he goes, Otto, just don't give a fuck about even trying to make you look like batrilopsis. 
[00:28:30]  He's just talking.  I can so fucking see that.  I don't give a fuck.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, it's great.  It's a great story, and I'm glad DeRosa called in.  But just the amount of people that have come and go is not fun.  Let's go to Todd in Burlington.  Todd, welcome to the pre-show.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster. 
[00:29:00]  Todd in Burlington here.  Want to give a shout-out to my CFF, Superfan Eric.  He can't call in today because he's in mourning, but I'm here for him.  And I think the way to raise the mood and to celebrate Otto's life and tax day is to bring in Denny and his hard drive of hit.  I would love, I mean, that's a great idea, Todd.  And by the way, I do like that Todd is making an attempt to pick up on the Superfan Eric cadence.  But I would love for Denny to have to handle something like this.  I never even thought of that. 
[00:29:30]  I should have had him host a pre-show today just so we could hear how Denny handles something that's actually real.  Like how, like, human emotion comes out of him.  Because he's so used to just keeping everything happy and going back to the music.  Like, nothing actually that's anything.  Maybe we'll bring him in on the show later today.  Well, a lot to get into, of course, on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to have some of Otto's friends in studio and on the phone. 
[00:30:00]  And by the way, don't worry about how I pronounce Otto.  You can say it any way you want, okay?  There are other things to worry about in your life.  I got that on Twitter a lot yesterday.  But, yeah, we'll have lots of Otto's friends talking about his life and celebrating that.  Ant was going on a rant about gun control last night.  I guess this is the day that you have to register all your weapons. 
[00:30:30]  And he's not happy about that.  I'm sure we'll get into that.  There's a flight attendant who decided to try her hand, speaking of stand-ups,  at some stand-up comedy while she was teaching everybody how to buckle their seatbelts.  And you know how Opie and Anthony love flight attendants who have to add a little spice of personality.  All of that and a whole lot more as the Opie and Anthony show begins right now. 
[00:31:00]  All of that and a whole lot more as the Opie and Anthony show begins right now. 
[00:31:30]  All of that and a whole lot more as the Opie and Anthony show begins. 
[00:32:00]  Opie and Anthony show begins right now. 
[00:32:30]  Opie and Anthony show begins right now.  Opie and Anthony show begins right now.  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  real. This is the Opie and Anthony Show. But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show 
[00:36:00]  on the road. Yes, good morning everyone. Welcome. Welcome aboard. Hi everybody. Pharrell  was crying, huh? And then we got planes and vaginas. What else we got today? We got tax  day. Tax day. We got the New York State Register Assault Weapon Day. That's a little side thing.  Don't worry about that. You'll be fine. Only the Second Amendment. The Great Fatsby. The  Great Fatsby. It's in the paper today. The Great Fatsby. That's just. The Great Fatsby is 
[00:36:30]  Leonardo DiCaprio. They caught him at the beach and took some pictures and I guess they put  on a few pounds. Yeah. You know, he's probably in between movies. Relaxing a little. It's  not even that bad. No, they're just. It's so fucking. They're pricks. Which paper was  that in? Open your workbooks. I gotta tweet that picture for the people. And then you 
[00:37:00]  got the Royals doing more of that nodding and observing. Looking around, pointing a little  over there. I see something. Trying something out. They like to try things out. I guess  in these pictures it's cricket. They're gonna try it a little bit. They try things out.  So they walk. They walk onto the field. Yeah. They nod a lot. They observe. They shake a  few hands and then they try it out. They grab a cricket. That's their lives. A cricket bat 
[00:37:30]  and kind of swing it a little and go, oh. Oh, look at me. I don't really know what I'm  doing. Now to the Fleshlight Factory where the Prince will start to go, oh, is this how  it works? You just fucking fucking. Be careful. Be careful. We're hurt around the world now  and they don't like us making fun of the Royals. You don't think fucking Prince William likes  a little Fleshlight every so often? Prince William in his hiney? I don't know. You know,  the Fleshlight. You put your dick in it. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. I was thinking 
[00:38:00]  the one with the attachment for his plagiarism. Oh, for his plagiarism. For his ass plagiarism.  Oh. If you said that in England, would you be just fired or something? Yeah, I think something  would happen to you. Just sick of the Royals. All they do is observe and then they try it  out and then they just walk away onto the next thing. A lot of pictures taken. Anyway, where  is the great fat speed I can't find in this paper? Leonardo DiCaprio is on vacation. Gained  a few pounds. And it is ridiculous. It's like, why? Thank you, Mars. Thank you. Give 
[00:38:30]  yourself a raise. Thank you. The press is just, they're just vultures. They love a good  headliner. Fat speed. That's just, could you imagine the shit they would catch if that  was a woman and she gained some weight and they put fat in some pun like that? It's, again,  that double standard's amazing. He might even be putting weight on for a movie. Maybe.  Might be one of those things where he's got to be 10 pounds heavier for a movie. Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  It doesn't even look that bad. Who's the chick he's with? I would take that body. I'm going  to get my shit back together. Get in DiCaprio shape. I'm going to try. Is that what you're  doing? Why not? Shut off. I just want to say quickly that the ONA community is strong.  Oh, is that it? Yeah, man. Everyone steps up when it really matters. We're a bunch of assholes,  obviously. And we all take our shots left and right. Yeah. But yesterday, man, the love  on Twitter for Otto was just amazing. I just want to acknowledge that. They're good eggs 
[00:39:30]  when they need to be. Really good eggs. Scumbag prick wads all the rest of the time. Well,  even those guys kind of pushed it down a little bit yesterday. Yeah. Even those guys. They  really did. Yeah. Oh. Remember him? The bandana. It's just stopping already. He's another guy that  did our show a lot. Yeah. And then when he got that big gig, goodbye. Yeah. Well, what was the 
[00:40:00]  big gig he got? I forgot now. Celebrity Apprentice. Yeah. Was it Celebrity Apprentice? Yeah. And then he  was on Dance with the Stars, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Briefly. Briefly. That is the biggest  bandana I've ever seen. It goes from the top of his eyes halfway back his head. Right.  What's he covering? Is he covering the hairline of a wig? Did Geraldo get married again? What  is going on over there? I don't want to win this thing. And no one, you know, no one is 
[00:40:30]  opponent. You know, and know your friend and your enemy. Right. Is that a good piece of  advice? That's a great advice. Welcome to life. Welcome to life. Welcome to reality.  I think that's a wig. It is a wig. I would bet a lot of money that's a wig. Right. Because  he used to wear the bandana and a hat. Right. Because I guess the top was gone. Right. And  now he wears the bandana really wide to cover up the hairline of the wig? Probably. That  absolutely is a wig. Yeah. It might hold it on, too. It might help hold it on. You think 
[00:41:00]  it holds the wig on? I don't know how that stuff works. No one has. No. I don't know  either. It's great. No one has youthful hair at that age. No. You might be lucky enough  to keep a lot more of your hair at that age, but it doesn't look youthful anymore. You  know what I mean? That bandana is so wide. You can tell. Look how much hair he's got.  Look at his top. It's bubbling out of the top now. Not even close to a part. You can't  see scalp at all. No, man. Oh, that's great. You're kidding me. Oh, boy. Poor bastard. 
[00:41:30]  He used to be kind of a friend of the show. I don't know what happened there. Poor bastard.  People just pass us by when they get the bigger gigs. What are you going to do? Yeah.  It's going to suck. Huh? It's just going to suck. Poor fuck. If you're just known for that,  you know, back in the 80s, his flowing blonde locks, and he's doing that, and then you just  realize, like, as you're brushing your hair one day, like, uh-oh. Uh-oh. It's coming out. 
[00:42:00]  I would love to know what day it was, where he went from, all right, this shit is not happening  anymore, and then he goes and gets a wig and does the whole switcheroo, and no one notices.  No one noticed? Do you go away for a little while?  Is that his hair coming out of the bottom of the bandana? Hell no. No? Okay. Fuck no.  All right, so it's the top and the bottom of the bandana. It's the whole thing.  So he just pulls that off. I bet you, I bet you, Brett Michaels, and I love you, buddy. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, no. Love you, Misha, but I don't think you're coming back here for whatever reason.  I bet you he, he's horseshoe bald. You think that? Oh, shit. You think he's got the old  horse shoe? Are there any pictures? Has anyone ever caught him? No, why don't we go online  there, Sam? Sam, uh, bald Bert Michaels, um, has anyone ever, ever caught him? Isn't this  just a minute after we've said what pricks the media are for the great Fatsby? The great 
[00:43:00]  Fatsby. Yes, we did. We did indeed. You got pictures of him, uh, looks like in court or  something. Oh, well, that looks, uh, how old is that? There's no way that's his hair.  Yeah, that's not terribly old. This is from the VH1 show. It's maybe like five or six years  old. Right. But that appears to be a wig to me. Yeah, yeah. To you? Yeah. I'm so bad  at being able to tell. See, that's his, that's his real hair. Yeah, see? Back in the 80s. He 
[00:43:30]  kind of had some waves to it, and now it's straight as an arrow, so. Somewhere along the  line. Barbie doll hair. He, uh, did the old switcheroo and walked out of the house hoping  no one would notice. Because wouldn't you go out at some point without the bandana? Sure.  I mean, you got, if you got a head of hair like that, you would go out without the bandana.  I can't, I can't totally prove it, but when we first started doing radio together, remember 
[00:44:00]  Jay Giles, what's his name there? Oh, yeah, yeah. What's his name? Peter Wolfe. Peter Wolfe.  Remember he was on our, our flight to LA? Yeah. And then we're at this, um, uh, Hyatt on the,  uh, Hyatt on the Sunset or whatever they call it. Uh-huh. And I took an early morning, uh, walk  and I swear, but I cannot prove this, that I saw him outside also taking that early morning  walk. Yeah. Completely bald. Peter Wolfe, yeah. And we made eye contact. Uh-oh. Because we  kind of knew each other a little bit from Boston. Just a little bit. Did he turn his head? Did  he put his head down real quick? He had the, the look of panic in his eyes. Oh, you should 
[00:44:30]  have invented the cell phone cam and taken some pictures. Right. So I think these guys do  do that. Yeah. You got to get, you got to get them early in the morning. Yeah. Early in  the morning when they're airing it. Early in the morning where they don't feel like putting  on that hole. They're airing out their scalps. They don't feel like putting on their costume  yet. Brett Michaels has a costume. Yeah. He wears a costume every day. I mean, you would  see that around Halloween. Right. His get up with the big bandana and the straight hair. 
[00:45:00]  Cowboy hat with the big cross on the front. Even though his hair used to be wavy when he  was, uh, you know, in his prime. Yeah. Brett Michaels shaved his head for a movie called  Letter, Letter from Death Row. But maybe that was the excuse. Yeah. And then he goes,  all right, well, I gotta, I gotta put a wig on, but I'm going to keep this wig on forever  because I got some problems upstairs. Yeah. I don't know. Hmm. Anyway, it's tax day,  everybody. It certainly is. And I was laughing on the way in because, um, I think it was 1010 
[00:45:30]  Winds was talking about how they got the mobile trucks outside the post office. Oh yeah. And  I bet you there'll be a few radio stations down there. A few stations that'll, uh, be, uh,  broadcasting live from the post office. What is the Todd show doing for tax day, Sam? Maybe  we should have Iraq take a listen. Cause I'm the tax man. They'll probably do like that and  do a parody. Well, our local news is local news covering the tax thing. Cause maybe the  Hawks should be down there. Oh boy. Oh wow. Right. Local post office. Yeah. Travis should  do a flyby. The thing is nobody really goes now. Eric just walked out of here saying, no, 
[00:46:00]  maybe the Hawks busy. I doubt the Hawks busy. I don't think so. Hawks are never busy. What's  his problem today? I don't know. I just, I think sometimes Eric doesn't want to be his  alter ego. I thought the return of the Hawk was a success. All right. We've got to keep  it going. Taxes. Yeah. Pay your taxes. Then you see his tiny fists in the air and then just 
[00:46:30]  kind of stop and not be sure what to do. I don't know what to do. That literally you've  never seen a better definition of running out of steam than Eric in that moment. That  was great. Those little arms going up was running out of steam. It was all lackluster  at the end. Yeah. It was absolutely great. It was great. Oh yeah. Post office is open  until midnight tonight, people get in there. You got to get it postmarked by 1159. I threw  a little extension in the mail yesterday. Me too. With a pretty big check. Big fat check. 
[00:47:00]  Big fat checks. Two of them. Federal and state. Can I say my number? Um, cause it, no. Yeah.  Yeah. And people do calculations. Oh really? Yeah. But it's just a, it's just a, it's just  a holding marker. Well, I would say, suffice to say mine was double what yours was. We'll  just say that. No. Close though. It was very close. Why double? You think cause it write  offs? You gotta get a, you gotta, you gotta get a wife and a few of those kids. I'm married  with no kids. If you're a single guy, you're a single guy in this country, the big dick, the 
[00:47:30]  big federal state dick. Yeah. It was pretty fucking, uh, brutal. But we're not doing our  part. No, no, not doing our part. That's it. I'll tell you, man. I was telling you right  before the show, anyone that, anyone out there that, you know, says you're not doing your  part, if those people were making crazy money, they would be completely outraged by the amount  of money that you have to pay. Nobody on the 15th of April goes, Oh, goody. Oh boy. I 
[00:48:00]  get to do my part. I'm not doing enough. Right. Let me give more money. No one does  that. So shut the fuck up. Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett. But that was after when he's  80 already. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are some anomalies out there, but for the most  part, and maybe Mr. Gates. Yeah. I think Mr. Gates enjoys writing money. Well, that's for  charitable stuff. Writing checks for money. For charitable stuff, that's one thing. For 
[00:48:30]  giving your money to someone else to squander, that gets a little frustrating. And boy, does  the United States government know how to squander. Right. Wow. So. They are squanderers.  Let me, uh, let me get ahead of this. Yeah. I'm not pitching about taxes. Relax. No. Because  you're going to hear it on Twitter. No. Poor, poor millionaires. Oh yeah. Bitching about 
[00:49:00]  taxes. Says the millionaire. Shut the fuck up. We talk for everyone. It doesn't matter  how much money you make. You don't want to, you don't want, you don't want to pay that  many taxes. No, you don't. If it was like an amazing system where you paid in this much  tax and, and amazing things happened. Right. I'd, uh, I wouldn't feel as bad, but I just  know the waste that goes on and, and, and the, the, the politics in this country is just, 
[00:49:30]  it's a, it's a big money pit that you just throw cash into. And, and it doesn't even  balance, balance out what, what goodness comes out the other end. I was bitching when I was  making 40 G's a year. You're bitching now. I was a bitching when I was making nothing.  I'm bitching. You can't believe, although having that, uh, that refund check, which,  you know. Oh, remember the refund check? Those days have passed us by, but the refund check. 
[00:50:00]  You're getting back 1,500. Oh man, that was kind of fun, but it was your money to begin  with. I know, but you felt like they were holding it for you. Right. Everyone thought  it was like, it was like, like free money, just found money. What are you getting? 1,500.  Yeah. I never got that high. How much did they take? I used to get like between 12 and 15  around there somewhere. Really? I got way less than that. Yeah. Maybe like five to seven,  hundred. Really? A hundred? Yeah. But it was nice. All of a sudden you bought a little something 
[00:50:30]  for yourself. That's why they do that. Cause you feel like it's free money. So you go out  and spend it immediately. It's a great way for the government to like keep you, uh, in the dark  about things, but they, they paid me. It's just great. No, it's a piece of the money that you got  back. They're borrowing your money. Right. They're using that money to make money with or do whatever  the fuck they want. And then they'll give you back some of it because you overpaid. It's it really  is a fucking ridiculous system. I still need to check once in a while my personal taxes, 
[00:51:00]  but it's very small. Yeah. Like literally it might be, uh, you know, 30 something dollars.  I get really weird, small checks made out to my, my, my, my, righteous bucks. Yeah.  Terribly embarrassing checks. I'm getting back $52. I need that whole $52. If we're going  camping, Alice, he was all psyched. He was getting $52 back. I bet you didn't get it in the end,  right? Uh, how does that one end? I forget. Uh, well, Oh, it was, it was, uh, it wasn't  the refund check. It was that they wanted to see him down at the IRS office and he was 
[00:51:30]  freaking out the whole time wondering why. And that's when him and Norton sat down to  go over it. Right. And he's like, well, I got a skinny chicken as a bonus. One skinny  chicken. He's writing down the shit. A horse with a clock in its stomach. Writing his deductions  down. That's hilarious. Well, we got Joanne from Massachusetts a year ago today, by the  way, for Boston. Oh, the marathon was a year ago today that all that went down. Well, where 
[00:52:00]  is the marathon now? Well, well, the calendar is different every year. And so, Oh, is it?  I think it's a, when is the marathon? It's got to be like a Sunday or something. Is it Monday?  Monday. The day after Easter. I think it's Monday. Oh yeah. Let me say hi to Joanne in Massachusetts.  Joanne. Hey, Joe. Hey, what's up guys? What's up Joanne? Wednesday.  Where's the Boston? Oh boy. I forgot. People don't like having normal conversations. No,  they're on the phone. I just want to know when the Boston marathon is. Monday. It is 
[00:52:30]  Monday. Okay. She goes Monday. Like we should all know. All right. I'm sorry. So what's  up? I'm a teacher. So I'm bright and early this morning. Very funny. Nice. Where are  you? No, I just want to say Anthony was talking about paying a shitload of taxes, being a single  guy. Yeah. Well, my husband and I, we make about, I don't know, almost 200 grand a year  together with no kids. We're known as dinks. Double income, no kids. And we get fucked  up the ass. Oh, double income, no kids. Oh boy. Oh boy. You don't want to be a dink. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah. You don't want to be one of those. Yeah. So we paid literally thousands of dollars  in taxes. Yeah. Yeah. That's a bitch. I hear you. Well, what are you going to do? I hear  you. I know. You can't do anything. At least the politicians put it all to good use. Oh  yeah. I think that's what's infuriating. Right up their noses. Oh boy. They just don't know  how to spend our money properly. No, they don't. They waste it. They really don't.  It's wasted. And we'll never figure that out, right? No. All right, Joanne. Thank you. 
[00:53:30]  It's not representative. Bye bye. Bye bye. But is it good if you have a government job?  Knowing they don't spend the money properly. So if you have a government job, at least you  don't feel as frustrated by that. I don't know. Maybe your job is one of those things that  aren't being spent properly. Maybe you've got a redundant job. Or you've got a kick-ass  salary for doing nothing. That's true too. Because you've got a government job. Maybe  those people are happy. Government. My government job. I don't know. I never worked for the government, 
[00:54:00]  I don't think. I never did either. Did I? I don't think so. I don't know. Were you in the CIA  or anything? A little bit. Like one of those crazy people that write numbers on the wall? A little  bit. Beautiful mind, lunatic. You never got any older. She never got any older. Right. That was a really  good movie. That was a very good movie. I liked that one. There was a time I had a little  action going on. Oh yeah. A little action. Well. I'll have to wait for the book. Oh boy.  Book's coming. Oh boy. So. I'm so last minute too. I was like, I had to print out some stuff 
[00:54:30]  to fill out forms. And so I go into my little office and I start printing and it comes out  like a fucking third grade ditto. It's like all broken up, the lines and the fucking text,  half of it's coming out. And I'm like, and then the message comes up, you have no ink.  You're ink. So I had to run to fucking Best Buy and grab some ink. And then it's just when  you have something to do, it sure does take long for that printer to realize it has ink 
[00:55:00]  in it. Yeah. It's got to kind of soak it in. It's got to do that whole thing. It's got to digest  the ink for a while. Charging cartridge. You stand there like, come on already. I  got to print something. So annoying. The fact that you just did that impression. I am  awestruck. Who does that? It's a stupid printer. I know, but it's a great impression and everybody 
[00:55:30]  knows that sound. And then my printer was actually saying, uh, Neil Peart. It was going  and it was stuck in my head that it was saying Neil Peart. It sounded just like it. It's reminding  you, you got to listen to a little rush. You got to get that moving pictures. That's what they say  when they cuff a man in his underpants with blood on them. My printer was saying Neil Peart. It was  saying Neil Peart. So I had to kill 21, 12 of them. 21, 12 of them. Very good. Uh, shit. Yeah. So, 
[00:56:00]  so then I was printing out those because, uh, I had to, you know, fill out the taxes, all last minute  shit. And then, and then I get home and, and with the ink and realize, uh, uh, I didn't really  didn't have a paper. Right. I only had a few little pieces of printer paper left. I'm the worst. And I  had to print up my fucking, my New York state gun registration, assault weapon revenge registration  forms. That's easy though. You're good. Oh boy. All your guns registered. Today's the day to register 
[00:56:30]  a lot of guns or something. Apparently. Yeah. I don't know. Saw you, uh, taking out Twitter last night.  It's just, uh, it's just a chore. People don't understand their own rights. Right. It's beyond  me. Well, I mean, you know, we got to do that. I guess too many guns out there. Oh, is that it?  What's too many? Too many guns out there and the bad guys are doing this too. So you relax. Are they 
[00:57:00]  registering their weapons? Yep. Here's what's happening in New York, by the way, they are, um, making  people register their guns. And I don't think it's as not right now. Anyway, I, I, I, in the future,  I see this bad shit coming, but not right now, but people are saying like, oh, you, you register  your guns and then they have a, uh, a whole list of the people that have them. So if they want to  confiscate them, they know where to go. Well, that's true, but I don't think we're there yet.  Not yet, but here's what they are doing. They're making you register your assault weapons, which is 
[00:57:30]  ridiculous. And, um, if you don't, uh, then you've committed some type of infraction or crime or what  have you. Right. And that then will make it more difficult for you to get guns and they could take  your guns away. Right. If it's a gun crime, uh, and you have to put it on your paperwork when you  apply for a new gun, they'd just be like, no, you didn't do that. And a lot of people don't even know  you have to register these quote unquote assault weapons. And, and for the fact, the fact that in 
[00:58:00]  New York state, there were five murders committed. This is 2011 stats, but every year it's very  similar. Five murders committed with rifles in New York state in the entire state for a year,  five. It's a lot, right? Uh, yeah, that's so many. And that doesn't even distinguish assault rifle or  hunting rifle, bolt action, whatever. It's just rifle. So let's say even all five of them are assault  weapons. Does that really make it necessary to put a law in place that makes legal law abiding 
[00:58:30]  citizens, criminals for not registering these horrible guns that committed five murders in  a year? Yes. No, Jim. The answer is no. Sorry, I didn't know the answer.  Yes. You're not paying attention in class. So, uh, so that's their angle. And, and, and it sounds, 
[00:59:00]  you know, conspiratorial, but, uh, I really think that's their angle to get as many people  that aren't knowledgeable about what they need to do with these gun laws and then confiscate their  guns. Cause then it's like, we're not coming and taking your guns. Well, if you, if you're going  to be illegal, we are, you know, we have to, this is what people expect of us is that that's their  way around. So a lot of second amendment, but if you register your guns, then you're good. But  there, there's, they, they're assuming that most, a lot of people, there'll be a lot of people that 
[00:59:30]  don't for whatever reason. Right. And you have to register them every five years. So in five more  years, they got another batch of people that don't know. And then it's like, well, if you  register your gun, well then that is the longer range thing where you do have this registration  of weapons that, uh, the government, um, has knowledge of what weapons you have. And, and  that's just a dangerous precedent to set. I don't, I don't think, um, you're supposed to, 
[01:00:00]  the government, the government entity is supposed to really know what, uh, the free people of  this country have to defend themselves. It's a Cuomo thing. Cuomo's just looking out for  us. Cuomo's a fucking asshole. The safe act. And it's called the safe act. And he has this  whole thing on the website about how this helps and everyone loves it because it makes people  safer. How does this make anyone safer? The safe act? No, it doesn't. Is that what you 
[01:00:30]  Yes, it's called the safe act. And they call it that. It's all, it's all that, that fucking  psychological bullshit. They try to pull on morons. Well, I just want you to have a place  to put your valuables in case of a fire. It's not a safe, like a vault, Jimmy. I was a hundred  percent behind it. Let's go to Elio in upstate New York. He's with you. Elio pizzas. Hello.  Morning guys. Hello. Cardboard. Hello. And listen, Anthony, I agree totally with you. I've had my 
[01:01:00]  pistol permit for over 23 years and I think it's a load of shit. It is. Another thing is  that my pistol permit, I have a pistol that I think is considered an assault weapon, but  it's already registered. So they don't want you to register it again. Yeah, yeah. There  are certain things that are registered under your license in New York as a pistol. Because  I have a, I have a, an MP5 and I, I, it's on my pistol license because they don't have  like hybrid rifle pistols here in New York. They're illegal. So, uh, so I have to register 
[01:01:30]  that. Like, I'm not even sure. Do I have to now register that as an assault weapon, even  though it's completely registered and, and documented on my pistol license? The vagary of  these laws, it's, uh, just set up to fuck, uh, the law abiding citizen over. It really  is. Well, there's also a couple of things that you can do with your weapons that, uh,  circumvent the law. Oh yeah. The MR, MR, AR MR2. Oh boy. Which is, uh, numbers that you 
[01:02:00]  place for your magazine that circumvents that. I've seen all the, the work around this stuff.  People are saying to just saw the pistol grip off of your assault weapon and send it to  Cuomo because if it doesn't have a pistol grip, it doesn't, uh, it's not an assault weapon.  Gotcha. Uh, one other thing with the taxes, I, I, I have children also, but, uh, these children  I pay child support. So I get dicked because I got to pay taxes and don't get any money back 
[01:02:30]  because I'm a single guy. So. Wow. Jesus. Yeah. They figure out how to get you multiple times.  Yeah. Thank you, Elio. Enjoy your day, sir. Enjoy your day. We got food here. Why don't  we take a quick break? Yes. Let us do that. Should I get a laser printer? Is that what  people, is that what this is? Yeah. Is that like a, cause I, I know nothing about printers.  I don't really use printers very much. What do you use it? Like twice a year? It's pretty  much twice a year. Yeah. I don't even know how to use mine. Tax time. I don't even know how 
[01:03:00]  to turn it on. No. I don't know how to use it through the computer. No. Cause I don't  do it. I do it through your iPhone too. If you get the right ones now, if you're on  a Wi-Fi, it's actually cool. It's pretty sure from your phone. I was doing that last night.  It cleans once in a while. It's annoying cause it starts saying like John Bonham. Boo.  Boo. I'm still grieving.  Oh boy.  It's a, it's a tough day to be honest with you. Bob Kelly's coming in. Oh yes. Oh Bobby's

[01:14:30]  i love your opinions because you're so sir passionate sir vagary is a word is it yeah it's  a word okay made me second guess myself yeah well see there you go okay now we're both for  they big things so what we both learned something this morning don't you feel better about that  what's wrong with you oh this passive aggressive crapola bob get into what you're yeah what do you  get into your phone call what do you want i got some food to you go ahead the reason i wanted to 
[01:15:00]  get to you guys because anthony on a lot of your decisions i've been in law enforcement for about 20  years now okay uh i've fired weapons since i shot the tv at 10 years old in my living room okay i've got  a model 1894 30 30 winchester that's probably the greatest gun ever made all right anthony there's too  many effed up people running around this country right now who can't have access to these extremely 
[01:15:30]  powerful extremely deadly weapons now you've got to grab me the fact that there are a lot of eff ups  out there running around that shouldn't have weapons and because of the gun lobby because of their  influence in politics and the horrors that we've got running around in washington you'll agree with me on  that one no i i probably won't agree with you on the fact that an assault weapons ban does nothing  because most of the crimes are committed with pistols and uh over half of them are uh gang members 
[01:16:00]  okay let's get the pistols in anthony do you think that everybody in this country should run around  with a pistol no but it's everybody's right that they uh have the option to make that decision  themselves and it's only been in the last 30 years that everybody's been pushing for these guns  that i've been scared to go into a grocery store because you've got guys walking especially in  arizona okay arizona is a hotbed for this i see guys walking into the grocery stores nine millimeters 
[01:16:30]  under each of their arms how many how many crimes and murders are committed by legal law-abiding gun  owners that are uh legally carrying weapons like you said the guy in the grocery store or a concealed  weapons uh carrier in uh states that have concealed how many of those guys as opposed to the illegal guns  that are being used in crimes uh uh what what number you think is higher well that usually you'll find  that these guys have several pistols in their arsenal you don't have to look at the legal gun 
[01:17:00]  owner as the bad guy here you're doing everything the politicians are doing the legal gun owners are  not the people legal gun owners they're all legal gun owners exactly these crimes they're all legal  gun owners oh really which which crime which crimes are you talking about well let's see when i was  living up in vegas starting back in the late the sensationalized uh mass shootings that  and killed nine people okay with a shotgun yeah those things will those things will happen in any 
[01:17:30]  society of three hundred and some odd million people you're gonna have that happen the the thing  is the large majority the by far the large majority of legal gun owners are not killing people it's much  safer that people uh are able to protect themselves in the way that they seem uh deemed fit for for for  them and their family and it's the illegal guns and the laws that are already in place that are not 
[01:18:00]  being enforced there was some motherfucker that shot uh a few people um the other day i read about  it he had nine gun charges on him already and he was out on the streets how the fuck is that keeping  people safe and why then legislate against legal gun owners because that guy got out of jail nine times  after uh committing gun crimes that's where the problem lies with the politicians and uh law enforcement  not enforcing the laws that are already in place after the you went about it in a roof goldberg fashion 
[01:18:30]  right he didn't have access to all these guns he wouldn't have been i had a first charge in the  first place you oh is that it it's the access we got it we got to take take away take away everyone's  second amendment right because a few people are lunatics how about we start cracking down on uh the uh  people that are committing these these gun crimes instead of penalizing everybody and taking away  uh a right that we have in this country because you don't know who's going to commit these crimes 
[01:19:00]  oh we don't know so we don't know who's going to drive who's going to drive into a schoolyard full  of kids so we just take away vehicles from everybody too is that what we should do no here you want to  you want my solution yes that is my solution that first of all anybody you can carry your pistol okay  but you get six shots okay there's nothing more reliable than a revolver these stupid little  semi-automatic and i'll tell you what i'll give you any semi-automatic you want and i'll sit there 
[01:19:30]  with a 357 revolver that's from 20 yards okay and you won't be now this guy wants to have a duel  that's right i think you guys should do with your dick this is a real great debate i'm having here  with a fucking moron okay that name calling okay anthony how many it is name calling how many years  of college do you have anthony that's right zero zero how many do you have yeah i've got four years  but you didn't know what vagary was what happened yes anthony's dumb dropout did know what vagary 
[01:20:00]  was and you didn't so point anthony and lack of education why you think you have to have college  to educate uh to be educated in this country you can't educate yourself well what it says i know a  lot of college uh graduates that are fucking morons teach people how to interrupt people okay  teach people how to think okay that's right how to be able to put ideas together and to come up with  a rational thought i was doing that what happened no jim not everybody's locked behind their doors  right okay and hiding with their pair of 50 calibers taking aim at all the little black people that are 
[01:20:30]  going to come and get them aren't you afraid to go to the grocery store there it is what yeah you're  the one afraid to go to the grocery store you can't even buy lettuce you're afraid of the  you're afraid of the legal gun owners with fucking a gun under each arm legally in the grocery store  all these legal gun owners that i see going into the grocery store you guys would look at them and  you'd run okay unless you have a gun with you would i okay yeah you would because they're freaky  looking they're scarier than shit okay freaky looking wow that's a generalization kenny would 
[01:21:00]  you like to add to this conversation yes i would anthony all right mister i know you said you're a cop  but you lost all credibility in the beginning of your sermon when you said effed up yes that's true  that is true so you didn't say the word fuck you just said effed i don't uh i don't believe he's  might be a christian man though no i've got actually i'm an atheist okay oh all right  i was just i was just trying to keep another strike against you trying to keep the fucking 
[01:21:30]  conversation civil okay you fucking asshole is that oh there you go much better right we like  the lord on this show that's better you feel better now i think this proves a a great valid  point absolutely um oh no see i was talking about me you got a gun what do you care about  yeah what do i care about i care about having a better society i care about the fact that we're  destroying our environment i care about the fact that everybody's scared about each other i care 
[01:22:00]  about the fact that our society is denigrating but it's the fact that we've all lost all kind of  apathy there's nothing that's ever going to happen in this country because we've bought out  we stole off our politicians you and i no longer man listen to this this sounds like an occupy wall  street guy mister mister you can't fight city hall oh my god if any if anything i'm an anarchist 
[01:22:30]  but if i say the wrong anarchist no you're not exactly you're not yeah you can't be a cop and be  a member of a subversive group yeah yeah pick a side yeah anarchist pick a side and run with it  but noah was our politicians okay there are guys who died in 1776 falling across the delaware that  would look at what our society's become today and they would cry okay especially since our politicians  they don't give a shit exactly with people screaming that people's second amendment rights 
[01:23:00]  should be taken away they would be fucking screaming right why don't they just take the  bridge but they wouldn't be happy with what we did with this country well that's for sure  mr mr did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed uh yeah pretty much yeah  uh all right well mr you guys understand that i want mr to be great i want this country to be  great mr i served it go ahead mr just jerk yourself off you'll feel better

[01:27:30]  the clouds are overhead it's cloudy that was it like it started at 2 a.m this this goes to it  this goes back to our point with roland he has to be in on every everything that everyone else is  talking about he insisted that he woke up before everybody that he was up at 2 a.m right and it was  not cloudy yet right and he got that photo i looked out the window about midnight and saw all the  clouds and was like i'm not gonna be able to see shit oh he got me bad yeah he's all about the  red moon does he have a red moon t-shirt on today so i get high fives in the subway that sucks when 
[01:28:00]  there's like a an astral event and um and then the clouds and then the clouds fuck it all up and  then what you got to wait 822 years for it to happen again well there's going to be i think three  more of these okay good between now and september yeah hey when the clouds roll in on on something that  only happens once yeah whatever yeah that's uh it looks pretty cool though and he got a picture  with kevin costner kevin costner oh look he's wearing a little scarf sunglasses inside no this 
[01:28:30]  is a while back you think kevin costner's happy to be taking a picture with roland no he's just like  the invisible man why would he be happy kevin costner what's he doing a dumb scarf i love all  all the hashtags roland added to this photo all right he wrote uh hashtag kevin costner  and modern west hashtag kevin costner hashtag draft day hashtag the bodyguard hashtag the  untouchables hashtag crash davish hashtag bull durham about water world hashtag field of dreams 
[01:29:00]  hashtag dances with wolves hashtag robin hood prince of thieves what hashtag frank farmer what about  water world and postman you gotta go water world thing for instagram instagram you can keep going  you could hashtag all day long but who is searching those hashtags out no one like who's like oh  the bodyguard yeah let's see who's hashtagging that today i don't know dances with wolves is that  a trending topic the robin hood one that was a bomb a bomb a roo robin and prince of thieves 
[01:29:30]  trying could you uh could you uh keep a list oh could you keep a list of all the words we uh  make up today please thank you roland roly yes sir you tricked me with your uh your red moon  photo well it's like quest love has like one really up close to  of a photo of the red moon quest love uh-huh of the what moon of their blood moon oh the blood moon  the blood moon um that picture i i i i bought it from mr tyrese from dubai 
[01:30:00]  tyrese gibson yeah  roland goes i borrowed it yeah my bad so you borrowed it in your bed you did it on  purpose i'm gonna like your photo anyway well i i it's now roland's photo i used two filters that  he did not what'd you do oh you you squeezed a couple extra filters oh yeah to make it really red  oh good for you roland well that's not it's not even that color that's not at all 
[01:30:30]  cheating it's a blood orange see that was not red enough for me it's supposed to be  the blood moon not the blood orange moon what does it really look like that's tyrese's photo  oh okay let me see it's a little more orangey yeah right there's and look at roland roland's is  a pillow darker and a little more orange wait why was it red what happened there was a lunar  eclipse see i had me a little dark a little bit more oh yeah you did you reddened that one up  wow oh yeah the sky is totally black he turned the contrast way up 
[01:31:00]  saturation is that how you did that yeah yeah did you use a glendor filter no i would put the  filters all the way down to negative and then i put a black map behind it and dark skies  dark sky because you wanted to you wanted to steal tyrese's photo but have a better photo than  right so if you look at it is that my photo it can't be so you should have moved the clouds around  a little bit yeah you should have photoshopped those clouds in front of the moon a bit make 
[01:31:30]  it a different pattern are we keeping a list of words we make up yeah okay glendor filter oh glendor  filter totally made it up i thought it was on an app i thought there was a glendor filter  sounded legit to me yeah i was like i haven't heard of that one yet hmm like kevin costner  he was nice star filter yeah was he nice oh yeah what what nice that he took a picture with you and  walked away what else could he do see he did not take that oh that's uh i don't think he's trying to  pass that off as a photo he took though that's obviously a telescopic i wanted to take one seeing it 
[01:32:00]  with nice telephoto lens and everything but it wasn't happening how annoyed do you think kevin  costume would be if you stood there with him and did his entire speech at the end of jfk  22-minute monologue or whatever it was oh my god he said to him remember you're dying king and you  put your hand on his forearm how long do you think he would last before 30 seconds  i tell my i love the bodyguard i uh frank farmer he goes all right i'm kevin i'm like i know but  frank farmer oh boy do you think you have wow why didn't you hashtag with the hashtags no why 
[01:32:30]  didn't you hashtag water worlds yeah i don't want to remember that movie well it was a good one i  didn't like that one too much about the postman i like his wrong petty was in that water world was  a bigger bomber than robin hood was you know what they became a bigger cult it became a like a cult  thing you know in the theaters at bomber rude dennis hopper with the eye patch with the eye patch  yeah funny what about uh the big chill he was the dead body in the big chill i think 
[01:33:00]  that was his first role that was it very good they cut out all the scenes and what was left was him  dead yeah they had to be treated for everybody but supposedly he had lines in the movie they just  didn't use any of them in the end yeah was that really his first movie yeah what else was he in  10 cup oh a cal ripkin's wife  oh my god 
[01:33:30]  a perfect world that was good with the little kid and he's talking yeah that was a good one  right yeah where what was that one clean eastward the little kid and he kind of abducts him but kind  of teaches them things and he's kind of cool to him but he's still kind of nasty and i can't remember  yeah yeah he's a bank robber guy yeah yeah yeah oh you know who the dead body was in saw saw jack  nicholson he's lying it was it was the main character guy that was the twist

[01:46:00]  every song he does uh-huh yeah yeah i've heard this i don't know where but i've yeah  yeah we had to get number two all right what's number one  number it's got to be blurted lines it's not a good song gotta be blurted lines 
[01:46:30]  this is the top pharrell songs so he was on oprah uh breaking down his career and uh  all of a sudden he decided well for the oprah the dj was fired for playing blurred lines this  college yeah complained yeah because she thought she wants to create a safe environment so she  asked him not to play blurred lines i guess because that contributes to rape culture that's good  and then they fired the dj from this place unbelievable the fucking world we live in it's  disgusting it's disgusting so they're playing uh i guess across the world people made their own 
[01:47:00]  youtube videos for the song happy because that's the huge song right now oh it's  positive it's a positive message oh yeah because it's about people being happy all right and uh  this is so pharrell is watching all the people across the world making happy videos oh chip should  make one i think so too chip you gotta make your happy uh video yeah for pharrell yeah we'll put a  little rock edge to it yeah happy not

[01:49:30]  space what is she doing energy was absolutely uninterrupted by anything yeah other than allowing  it to flow from heart to heart and that's what happens when you see it no one could ever find those  places where else  w-h-e-r-e question mark i got it clever clever  there you go  i kind of bought it maybe i'm just a dope but i bought it were you happy when you heard the song 
[01:50:00]  no i didn't care but i mean it's a it's a catchy song to be honest with you if you do a piece of  work and then they show you a clip of people all over the world you know inspirational like maybe  that would be a little what it's just better to if you're going to have one of those emotional  moments take the hat off well what it looks silly with the hat on you're right cry with that hat on  yeah why don't we do jimmy a favor well let's get chips from around the world  yeah let's do chips from around the world  we're doing chip jokes in dakar yeah five seconds of you doing chip

[02:12:30]  rest of the day trying to think of the first time i saw him live and it was either i think jim we were  both saying it was either pips in brooklyn or governors where i saw him or then mostly magic  that old uh club in the city so but it was one of those three that's where i saw him live  my for me it was jersey it was uh varsity pub varsity pub i saw him at the remember the boston  comedy club had black night oh yeah on a sunday every sunday night black night two shows sold out  every fucking sunday and i went in there and uh when i first moved to new york and he comes on 
[02:13:00]  and it's black guy black i mean just annihilating i mean you know fucking roof shaking and he comes  on and it just got quiet and then he did that line he goes he goes yeah  black girl's pussy looks like a fucking wallet and the hot it just exploded i was like this  motherfucker's crazy he just killed yeah the varsity pub was the first time i saw him too yeah 
[02:13:30]  so it's the ever to go through there man that's where i met you it's where i fucking saw just a  bunch of quentin a whole shitload of people there's nothing better than watching the crowd like  20 or 30 of the crowd that didn't know who auto was walk out of the room he's so disgusted like  their faces like but everything he said and then people just slowly leaving yeah yeah and he's like  get out guys stay out yeah one time at governor's this fat woman was heckling him and she was leaving 
[02:14:00]  she's yelling at him he's yelling back and she's walking out she's like yeah yeah yeah and he just goes  i'm getting heckled by java the cunt he was the real pig but the people that stayed man would just  laugh absolutely show yeah yeah he's one of those guys man oh my god unbelievable he was funny funny  funny in here he was just oh yeah just he'd just sit there and you'd be like you're all right and then 
[02:14:30]  he'd just say something yeah when he would get rolling on something man oh my god he was a funny  dude man just as a guy it's like the puppet was the puppet but it was we just we would go to gigs we  spent so many hours we drove to buffalo together a few times pittsburgh and yeah just those seven  eight hour car rides he was fucking hilarious as a guy just as a just a mean humored  funny critical guy he was just he was just hilarious you come up with a good obscure movie reference  too yeah yeah yeah yeah can i say that can i say something i hate to throw up but uh when he did 
[02:15:00]  the dave's all porn and unfortunately the show was canceled before we got to like edit and put his  his thing together because he was going to be in the season three and he uh he came down otto and george  they both came down and they uh you know we're doing we wanted to do a special couple show where it was  like uh couples right i figured it would be great to have the two of them on and you know i didn't know like  how versed and knowledgeable he is about movies because we were watching i think it was like a  orgy scene and like an old retro like teen angel or something and he goes i go this is a classic am 
[02:15:30]  i right and he goes yes much like uh john ford's the searchers i'm like what i'm like you gotta dumb it  down dude the guy knew his classics yeah he was he was like uh it was really he clapped up the show  i guess that's what i'm sure yeah he was a really really weird movie buff and he just loved those  old 70s old stuff big ivan and costello fan yeah yeah lauren hardy yeah march brothers whenever i go 
[02:16:00]  over his house he had all those dvds he's always lending me to him like i don't know if i'm gonna be  able to watch this he's lovely yeah he had all these movies there watch this one watch this one  i'm like i don't know he was like from that time it's so weird you know he really he would fit in  perfectly back then ah vaudeville you gotta talk about how nice he was too man and really appreciated  uh people around him appreciate what we did for him said it a million times well it's cool i was cool 
[02:16:30]  you know and appreciated uh just the simple things in life as well greg i mean i was neighbors with  him right at one point i lived right around the corner from him and then you know still just a few  miles away i bring my son over there once every 10 days right love them yeah i loved going out  i would make us food and make my son food we both have these two little gay yorkies auto has one and i  have one so they'd come over they'd run around the backyard and it's a little play date for the dog oh yeah  we always he's like bring the dog here come on a little play date we'd walk him down the street 
[02:17:00]  i was like look look at us two homos walking with two little yorkies  yeah but my son just in fact loved them really constantly talked to let's go visit auto let's go  visit auto oh man that sucks did you see the uh set on tv he on on uh youtube or whatever it's auto  works clean yeah with the little kids performing for little kids at a kid's birthday party i never  said where is that yeah it's it's i mean it he throws in a couple of really adult reference like  but none of none of them are dirty but it was fun it was like something it was just shot like on a 
[02:17:30]  video camera it's like four minutes he did a lot of that stuff though he really created his own  content a lot yeah he had to you know he had that pig roast thing uh this thing called the teletubbies  he did he did a lot of stuff yeah right he was always shooting some kind of the pig roast was  funny man hilarious that was really good well done um but we can i have can i ask you a question  sure yeah did he really start when he was 15 because i really do think that that's that's  like his origin story that he started when he's 15 yeah 14 i think about on the streets of new york 
[02:18:00]  as a street performer yeah yeah street performer that's right okay he never worked a day like a  real job in his life and the uh he had there's a lot of pitches if you google auto and george pictures  he was actually uh he would tweet them he was actually tweeting that like probably two weeks ago  a week ago these old school pictures of him where he has a derby on right and he's 15 years old and  he's in the streets of new york working and it was just you know because he's and i read that thing 
[02:18:30]  that he wrote for his the comments that influenced him and he said it was laurel and hardy and uh he  liked that derby because laurel and hardy had derby so he would he wore that for years it looked like  the clockwork orange exactly yeah that's why he looked like alex with this little hairdo right  that's all when he was 15 years old look at those old pictures auto and george online man it's  amazing just go to his twitter auto and george on twitter they're all there he never worked out  another job a day job in his life never ever right which is great i mean yeah i saw him for the first  time at fast eddie's i know you guys performed yeah in huntington and man i mean we would we would tape 
[02:19:00]  it and then just make copies for everybody everybody wanted you know a copy of his performances at fast  eddie's just killing the place that's where i first heard the scene from true romance right the  fucking famous dennis hopper scene i'd never i hadn't seen the movie yet and uh auto's on stage  and he just starts doing that dialogue to some guy in the fucking audience and it really it chilled  the room a bit i bet i couldn't believe he was saying that to somebody i'm like what are you doing 
[02:19:30]  dude we were surprised his last appearance on the show was seven months ago i this this show is weird  because i would have said it was a month or two ago right and then you see the date and it was  september i think 26th of uh 2013 how was he doing in the last he was doing great that's what  i thought he's i you know i would see him at least three times a month we'd go over there during the  day we'd hang out and he was totally you know sober he did a gig friday night yeah he did have  a lot of his twitter wow he had a lot of gigs lined up he was in great shape but he looked he had that 
[02:20:00]  you know the bacterial meningitis thing happened about 10 months ago right like last memorial day and  that you know he was basically in a coma for a week right on a ventilator and everything they  didn't think he was going to make it so i don't know if that you know affected his health right  later on i don't know how much damage that does on the insides right probably did something to  his brain we you know we don't know what happened but you know it was in the afternoon yesterday so  it wasn't like he was out partying all night right sunday afternoon when this happened so it wasn't  like yeah last time we saw him he was he was right there he was great funny as all hell and didn't 
[02:20:30]  seem like anything was going on nothing at all seem like no you know when they were worried that with  the bacterial meningitis that he wasn't you know his brain wasn't going to function right after that  oh god it was and he came out of it a hundred percent oh absolutely wow yeah absolutely that  was very rare it was only like a 10 shot of getting it all back right jesus you know by the way that's  how uh jerry red went down right uh you know that he went down from meningitis what year was that  that jerry wilson died that was he died a year before my father so that was like 15 16 years ago 
[02:21:00]  wow so uh i i don't know what is that in uh 97 yeah something 98 ish 97 98 yeah auto uh i talked to  trish yesterday for about 20 minutes and she said that he uh you know his diet was not good you know  i mean like bacon he liked fucking whatever you know steak and mayo and so it may have been a heart  attack i mean i guess they'll find out in a week or so whatever how long autopsy takes but it might have  just been you know how's she doing she's kind of a wreck yeah you know what i mean but uh it was 
[02:21:30]  great for auto that he moved to the suburbs in jersey he had a lawn a deck fence for his little dog  and just took walks and stuff he needed that he needed to get out of the city and right all that  craziness and get away from that he loved just hanging out in his living room he had a big screen tv  watch old movies right hang out you know get some sun and stuff that he really enjoyed that right  yeah she said he loved his amazon car his amazon membership because he would order just order  movies off amazon like he just liked doing that he was trying to learn an ipad and that's  you know you know what's funny about him is that like east coast like we we all know him like we all 
[02:22:00]  know him so well but like when you go west coast it's only like a really like there's only very few  people that know about him they they either were transplant or they're like just really into sick  humor and like uh i don't know jim like which whoever you guys you know know this but like  did he ever like tour out there did he ever live in la i mean did he ever do any of that no he hated  it he hated la he didn't like any part of that business you know he got this you know he should 
[02:22:30]  have been a lot obviously a lot bigger than he than he was right but i would wouldn't take no  shit if someone he thought someone was fucking him over he'd tell him right to his face he didn't  care if it was an nbc executive right he was like that did he ever play vegas i mean like oh yeah  he did a lot of vegas he did vegas that was about as far west as i think he went is vegas  yeah he's like uh kevin meanie i saw last night and uh he he mentioned it to me he goes i heard  about auto i'm like oh you knew him he goes oh i loved that like every comic that knew him loved  right he was the guy that like he was one of the only guys that we could quote to each other 
[02:23:00]  without being sick to our sites yeah yeah yeah comedians never quote each other he's one of the guys  where if you work with him six shows over a weekend you'd watch every show yeah you have to go be out  there and watch because you never know what's going to happen with even if the same jokes over and over  again just you didn't care you didn't care i never run down to see a comic yeah but if he was around  i just you can't help but go watch it yeah me and i picked up girls one time in fucking delaware  after a gig it was some awful but i've told this story before it's an awful bar gig and we're in 
[02:23:30]  this girl's pool and we're fooling around and i'm fucking really hot like playing with the girl's  pussy through her thing and otto's getting nothing from his girls and he's standing there and he goes  look at them they're like melrose place and we're like meet the press  like what a funny funny  and then his letterman set amazing it was great just beating the  shit out of letterman paul schaefer the gig itself who does that yeah this game sucks it's letterman 
[02:24:00]  did letterman appreciate that set i don't even know did what letterman because the video online  it just ends after he's done i i i'd want to know what letterman did after that he had to like it  get letterman has to know it's funny yeah he had to know otto was up there i mean you know he did  fucking uh fistful of testicles loved him hated him he did day jokes like you know he did what he did  right it's amazing he pulled off such a great letterman set someone told me that at the end of that when he  shakes uh letterman's hand that george actually goes that was such an amazing set and that didn't 
[02:24:30]  push him forward that was 2007 yeah i wonder if he did like uh like of the bill boggs comedy hour  any of those like you know like like on a local uh you know showcase shows because i don't know  franklin i'm like yeah yeah something like that he would reference joe franklin on our show a lot  yeah i think he did and uncle floyd and joe franklin with another one right there's a youtube 
[02:25:00]  thing of him on al goldstein used to do midnight blue yeah midnight blue and him just ripping al  goldstein apart it's so fun oh really oh yeah it's on youtube yeah i gotta see that they all sorts  that out great yeah yeah yeah he did a lot of those local uh uh uh what else did he do he did  the comedy's dirtiest dozen full frontal comedy which i remember comedy's dirtiest dozen i think was  with uh ben creed and jackie martling yeah jackie martling kennison was on maybe no maybe not that  was 88 i think kennison was already big by then yeah and uh full frontal was like 97 i knew him when 
[02:25:30]  he did that i think rick messina produced that you know otto was a huge george carlin fan right  and he didn't know carlin knew him and goto was doing this gig in chicago maybe 10 i don't know 10  years ago so and carlin was in town i guess doing a theater he had no idea carlin came into the comedy  club and sat in the back and watched auto auto didn't know he was there and he came back and  they talked for like an hour wow oh did they for yeah yeah i could carlin was a huge auto fan and  i had no idea he couldn't believe it wow that's crazy yeah yeah yeah i saw the picture it was like  in the kitchen or something they took a they took a photo together david copperfield huge fan he's 
[02:26:00]  huge fan he's actually calling the show in about an hour to talk about auto copfield loves which band  was it that loved them stp was it wasn't uh i think i think it was stp or i i'm almost positive  it was stp was obsessed with auto and george as well scott wyland i think i'm getting this  i don't know someone back me up if you know there was this bar right down the street from where we  live just like little like white trash bar we'd hang out would hang out there all the time so the  owner convinced auto to do a show there a comedy show i was like all right fine so he sets it i said i 
[02:26:30]  i gotta go down and see this so it's just auto there's no other act so just like fat dj is on the  side of the stage like stage right like a tuck bad tuxedo with his bad dj fucking board and albums  it was still albums only like 10 years ago i got this guy bringing crates and records so he goes all  right we're gonna start the comedy show give it up for auto and george and auto just walked up there  didn't just looked over the puppet looked over at the guy goes do a setup you fat it was the only 
[02:27:00]  the first thing he said it was the most uncalled for thing the guy was just this happy-go-lucky guy  he was so excited that there's a comic there do a sit-up you fat fuck that's auto  do you remember and i didn't see this story comedians told me but do you remember years  ago that kid got mauled in the zoo by a polar bear right and auto was on stage the next night  and george's little outfit you know george like do you like my shoes i got him outside the polar  of their case brutal yeah he was a quite amusing man that's so mean yeah yeah but you'd hear stuff 
[02:27:30]  like that and then like um well my wife had we had our kid i was on the road after like a month  he was born and he lived right around the corner he'd go there like three times a week and check on my  wife he'd go bring her milk he's like whatever you need he'd just walk around the corner no problem  i'll help he didn't know what the hell he was doing right but that's just what the kind of guy  he was he was a sweetheart i mean and did what's what's the story of uh the puppet getting stabbed 
[02:28:00]  that was real right yeah yeah in central park was it yeah he made fun of a spanish guy and the  spanish guy actually stabbed the puppet stabbed the puppy yeah yeah but wasn't it wasn't it for like  uh mayor cops was there like how about a hand for our gay mayor i don't know i don't know the  there's a guy on the line that now the quote i heard was otto's told ron actually during a  master whatever he did ron said like who stabbed you and in in the park and auto said puerto rican 
[02:28:30]  who else right we're uh trying to get the unmasked for our podcast this week so we're doing some kind  auto and george podcast it will be out tomorrow on itunes and all those other places this guy  do you know the story of uh auto getting stabbed in central park or george actually buddha  yeah what's up um how do you know this story because he told me i was i used to do comedy uh  quarantine yeah i know yeah i know okay yeah i was at pips and i got off stage now pips you get 
[02:29:00]  heckled ridiculously and i was like ready to hang myself because it never happened to me i was only  doing comedy three months and auto was on the side and he liked me and he came up to me and i've  been friends with him for the past since then but he said to me he goes he goes don't worry about  getting heckled you'll get heckled all the time i'm like yeah why have you been heckled he goes  heckled at one time i was in central park i was like 19 18 years old and he was doing puerto rican  jokes and some dude got hit took a knife out and stabbed the puppet and i said to him i go what did 
[02:29:30]  you just say to him you know there was a crowd around and he looked right at the guy and goes  this cocksucker thinks i'm real  yeah absolutely i'm like all right i guess heck why isn't that bad if i didn't get stabbed and i  think thought i was friends with him ever since man it's a horrible loss man thanks a lot brother 
[02:30:00]  you're right thank you you know i i don't never um like he always was really nice to young comedians  he never had an attitude like um otto and george oh like always brought young guys around and nurtured  them and told them about comedy and stuff like that he was always never thought he was too big for  anybody well yeah he didn't write he didn't he was thinking about getting his driver's license  i didn't think about that that's like if it wasn't for levy being a drunk me and me and norton would  probably still be doing little fucking firehousing still be fucking co-middling somewhere bob's 
[02:30:30]  alcoholism got me so many gigs same with me we cut our teeth doing all these gigs and bob needed to  get around because he needed a ride yeah that's funny i would drive from north brunswick to pick  auto up in queens off jewel avenue and then draw a lot of times if we were doing pennsylvania or pittsburgh  i would drive back down the turnpike to exit six i didn't give a fuck wow i never cared but i just  all i wanted to do was work with auto i just didn't care you're a hell of a guy no i just  loved him he made me laugh you were a little fan boy i was a fan boy that's cool i used to go see 
[02:31:00]  him i remember trying to see him in vinnie's old club before the stroke was that place he booked  on george street before the stress factory wasn't there another place down there it was like a clarion  or something i think oh no maybe it was a hotel gig yeah hotel gig no it was it was after that it  might have been the first stress factory but it was still had couches and stuff i think it was brand  new the stress factory whenever that opened up and auto was like two hours late well we didn't  know if he was going to come and i had a friend who had to go home so i just made my friend leave 
[02:31:30]  um and he finally showed up but i remember i would go to gigs knowing that he really might not show up  just as a fan yeah what was that about they was doing drugs that was part of i think he was doing  drugs at that time yeah he's bad because he ran out out on us a few times during the new w days he  would be killing i said this yesterday but you guys didn't hear probably he would start off and he  would be killing for two or three minutes and then he would just get up and leave i mean we'll look at  each other and then we would learn later he thought he was sucking and was having a bad set or whatever  and the opposite was true that's what would happen with him in a lot of clubs if he didn't feel like 
[02:32:00]  the crowd was into him he would just get off stage you know as a headliner you have to do 45 minutes  you have to do at least 45 there's no other way around that at 20 he would just walk like good  night and just fucking walk off the stage like you can't he's like the crowd sucked i don't  don't fuck them i don't care and you know some of the clubs like look we can't have that you got  to do 45 minutes sure wow yeah you just like that they were they were too tired fuck them what would  they do they would the dmc would be like out the bar he wouldn't even know there's nobody on the 
[02:32:30]  stage everybody's running there's fucking managers running get on the stage tell the crowd they can't  leave because i gotta pay their check holy yeah just creating turmoil yeah you can't just walk  off right fuck it they that that crowd sucked i showed up at a couple of gigs after him after  he did that yeah and they're like how much time are you doing i'm like i'm gonna do an hour are you  sure yeah but in all fairness he got a lot of that together in later years no he did he wasn't doing  much of that that uh you know certainly sometimes the clubs didn't advertise them right you know you 
[02:33:00]  have to put triple x ventriloquist if not that you know people are going to be horrified oh look  a puppet i don't understand people being horrified in a comedy club i don't write because the thing  though when you see a puppet you think funny tv funny nice i remember the first time i saw him  when he had a puppet i was like this is gonna stink and then i my fucking mouth was open the whole  show like right what the fuck were you blowing i was sucking everybody off and then the kennedy bit  when the fucking head slops off it's like and then when george would say to auto he goes look 
[02:33:30]  at you look at your hair it looks like you comb your hair with a cock and whenever the waitress  would be walking by in the front he'd be in the middle of his act he goes can i get a cocktail  a car guess like that fucking car  or when you look into the crowd and go look oh it's a black guy guilty yeah guilty  and then and then i would have to pull george back onto his lap come on yeah come down  calm down don't say that about people george do you remember before he had the i remember when 
[02:34:00]  he got the puppet's head done and he said he was going to do it but when he used to do the kennedy  assassination bit george's head would just move and the wig would just jostle forward a little  bit it was before the right it was the head was modified he had the brain before he completely committed  yeah it was still funny though it would just be like you know uh you know a chunk of his skull just  would just shoot forward a little bit and whenever a joke would bomb he just look george would look at  auto you you stink you dirty jew 
[02:34:30]  yeah the uh the way george would come back at him oh yeah every time you talk the show stops  it would be like another person sitting there  fucking lambasting this poor guy sitting on stage with this hostile dummy you would feel so sorry for  auto with what george was saying i love it he's like oh look at the nice crowd of people and you  you know in your head he fucking despises i know fucking assholes and george is gonna  fucking let him know yeah that inner monologue stuff jimmy talked about that on your facebook 
[02:35:00]  post which was uh well done by the way i meant to tell you before the show what a nice crowd of  people here george fuck them yeah yeah go to jim norton's uh facebook page he wrote a nice little  thing yeah it was just that it was that inner monologue it was that weird it didn't feel fake  like a lot like a lot of puppets and their guys had like that that cantankerous relationship but with  him it was just like you because it was interrupting and it was just and auto would just like look like 
[02:35:30]  oh why is this happening yeah like why am i saying these things to myself i used to take him i remember  we would do we did lancaster a lot together in uh that day vernally gig and when there was a three  night gig you know you did a i think a friday saturday sunday right it was friday and two shows  saturday so we would go in like a lot of times on a thursday night and uh it would i would take him  he would always want to cop drugs and uh i mean this is again 1996 and he would want me to take him  downtown but i'm like i'm not taking it to get high i'm not doing it i'm not fucking sitting there 
[02:36:00]  getting arrested so i'll drop him off in these awful neighborhoods oh wow and uh i'm like if  you want to do it you can and i was hoping it would dissuade him from right doing it yeah sure  it doesn't work yeah that was the place where that was the same club it was in a hotel  the comedy club was in a hotel so you'd stay right in the hotel and auto was like one night  like three four in the morning was prank phone calling everybody in the hotel and waking him up  rinaldi said he did that i saw a day recently because he was trying to find my room and he 
[02:36:30]  didn't know what room i was in so he was calling people and then he was just going cock and hanging  up the phone like morning over and over again he probably had a couple  people waiting for you to answer the phone again i don't know yeah he's probably not in the right  state of mind great uh someone to know what were patrice and auto like when they were together  we had them on the show at the same time a few times yeah they liked each other yeah i don't 
[02:37:00]  really have an answer there yeah they obviously liked each other they both they both thought the  other one was very funny i mean you know patrice respected auto and knew he was very funny  and he loved patrice there's a picture going around and a lot of us tweeted it's ralphie may it's us  then ralphie may uh auto and george and then patrice in vegas at the vegas poolside yeah when we did  that live broadcast at the pool and no one gave a shit because they weren't our demo except for our  fans that showed up and it was very obvious which ones were our fans remember that yeah  everyone else is looking on in their tiny little bikinis going what's going on over there 
[02:37:30]  back when it was like the rehab was the hottest thing in vegas it was just us the crowd looked like  a bunch of me's remember close us were a bunch of you's and then as you went further away there's  the rest of vegas yeah it was the beautiful people the beautiful people yeah remember we did that awful  beacher gig i bombed so bad on that game bobby did great and um i i bombed terribly i ate a girl's 
[02:38:00]  pussy and bobby filmed it i found that recently pictures you took yeah that was funny i saw a  professional pussy eater like i was like it was just like a machine like he all right hang on he  he took like deep breaths rolled his neck with his tongue  this chick lost her fucking mind that's right she hot she yeah she had a nice body she was great yeah  she was hot yeah she was fucking great why is it we've all seen jimmy's penis or jimmy 
[02:38:30]  fucking or eating pussy well yeah well yeah anthony never has have you yeah i was on a limo once  that's right i was getting my dick sucked while you were what a professional anthony was  so you got all of us we've all seen jimmy action yeah i i we used to live together i had this girl  over and we were fooling around like in my office and i had like naked in my office in the middle of  the day and then i looked we'd look down the hallway like in the kitchen and jim was jerking  off he had his dick out he's jerking off look what he's doing i'm like guys just i don't know 
[02:39:00]  don't worry about it don't even look down there i know tell him this time he's got his dick out  don't even look down there oh that should help the situation  i wanted i wanted jim to blow a load i was getting my ass eaten one time my old apartment and jim was on  his computer they just saw him in the distance on the computer if i could do it just a glow in his  face right and i'm getting my ass eating i got my leg up on a wall then you hear 
[02:39:30]  this girl almost throws up because some nugget fell in her mouth  i look at jim and he just gives me that you  fucking pig face i remember i was so annoyed that bob had his sock up on my wall  i was like he's gonna get your fucking scuff marks on my wall  your foot up on the wall he was right how do you get your ass eaten what am i gonna do tippy  toe it wait were you on your back now i had one uh i was i think i was in shape at that point so 
[02:40:00]  you were you were like like on all fours kind of and she was behind you i was standing oh standing  so then you put like like that uh how to insert a tampon thing on the uh yes the girl with her  foot up on the toilet yes exactly oh okay did we lose david tell through this oh no i'm here i'm  listening okay have you ever fucking seen jim's cock no i've never had an experience like that with  dave or with uh with auto i never did even yeah we met girls but we never with jim when we tour on 
[02:40:30]  your uh the anti-social tour it was always like uh it was like the saddest just like almost like  death rattling uh farts oh golly i know he's on the way to the gig backstage during the meet and  greet it was just like you know that that vegas that vegas game the vegas game we did for the  virus we're in my room him and his girl at the time oh yeah chelsea yeah right and we're in the  room and i go look i just gotta use the bathroom i'll be right out i go in to take a 
[02:41:00]  shit i hear giggling they're just giggling in my room and i don't have a suite it's just a  one regular room and then you hear the door shut and i walk out i'm like what the fuck did he do  he shit in my barrel in the room just this black tar heroin but i'm sitting there going he had to do  it in front of his chick and i couldn't believe i did that but i was joking with her i'm like i have  to shit and i wanted to shit and she goes you got to do it and it was i knew it was going to be a  solid one and it was probably a good footer foot and a half and i just dropped it right in that 
[02:41:30]  perfect you know that like the unused waste paper basket fucking plastic in bob's room one of the  best moments i've had i had to go and just like a like a dead body i had to go find a place to  dispose of this bag of shit okay should have left it near the ice machine or something  one time levy had a threw his back out he couldn't get out of bed so i went in his bathroom i took an  upper decker in his bathroom on top of the top i took a shit up there he's fucking he knows what 
[02:42:00]  he's doing because he could see through the mirror and i had the door open he's like they  couldn't get out of bed he's like mother get out go do it in your own room i'm sitting on top  of the toilet yeah in his hotel room why would you go do it in your own room okay why because he  couldn't get out of bed i wanted to stick up his room i'm saying why would he say go do it  i know yeah like i'm gonna yeah right there's no joke there that's no why why would you do it  in your own room oh my god just hunks of garbage really pieces we just we shouldn't have anything 
[02:42:30]  my son at three years old i never saw him do this before we're over auto's house auto's on the couch  he's jumping on auto we'd love to jump on him and at one point he just bent over right in front of auto  and farted right in his face he i'd never seen him do that before that was the first time he ever did i  don't know where he learned it like obviously from me but he never any and auto was like jesus  jesus he's just going crazy and i was like a running gag look you gonna fart in my face just 
[02:43:00]  fucking right in auto's face he was surprisingly nice like you you know he's just dirty aggressive  comedian but he stayed at my family's house a lot in jersey when we would do gigs and it would be too  late for me to drive him home or whatever so he would come i would drive whatever on the way home back  to north brunswick at three in the morning he would just crash in my uh my parents house when  i was you know and then a lot of times take the train home the next day if it was too late for me  to drive him and just a gentleman i mean he was really he was really nice to my family and my he  was courteous and a polite well-mannered guy he wasn't this fucking animal no no not like george 
[02:43:30]  yeah yeah he was a really like george he was he was a very uh he knew how to behave around people  he wasn't he wasn't a dick you know you know what i liked about uh you know the way his act worked  is like you know how like you see some of these uh like acts the eventual cause actually they got like  the little costumes you know like like george was like a rough character like he never like wore like  a little cowboy suit or the sailor suit or any of that bullshit he was he was like he was ready to 
[02:44:00]  rock i like that yeah i guess i'll wear a suit like a nice tasteful dark suit though now you  you could almost imagine what uh what george would say if he was dressed in in some kind of a wacky  outfit yeah there's no way he'd have a belt on and shoes yeah yeah that's right little jeans with  cuffed on the bottom there's no way it's surprising was he always like that i mean from the very  beginning like did the character develop or was he just like that i think it got different as time  went on he had different puppets um i remember we worked together once and the fucking string broke 
[02:44:30]  in the mouth and that was a rough oh shit i heard that sorry yeah and he had i'm sure it happened  more than once over all the years there's a little piano wire that would operate the mouth and he i  guess would use his fingers inside the back of the puppet but it happened more than once i'm sure  i remember once it broke and he had to the show started late because he had to get something to to  rig it you know wow oh yeah the mouth is pretty important very important that's the important  part for the illusion yes the illusion though his lips moves yeah i didn't like patrice saying that 
[02:45:00]  yeah that motherfucker isn't even trying to be a vent  yeah there were times when he was really good when he wanted to be when he was conscious of it and  he was trying you know yeah and then other times it was just too big of an argument between him and  the fucking it just went back and forth and he would always make the puppet look at him it was  like hey idiot have them look at have george look at the crowd i know look at him george always  looked back at him and it was like what are you doing now we have to look at you 
[02:45:30]  for for no reason he'd be doing well george would just look back and go you know you're a no  talent bag of shit that was his baby's line no talent bag of shit but out of nowhere  it was just it was just this inner monologue that he was fighting with constantly oh god it would  just be so brutal so unearned like he hadn't done anything to deserve it and he would still be talking  while george was like looking at him waiting to say that so he's like setting it up but otto's still 
[02:46:00]  talking and you know it was such a weird like how do you know to do that the brilliance of it yeah  i really think about it break it down where is the puppet right now i don't know i bet you copperfield  wants it i think copperfield has one actually right yeah he took yeah he uh he replaced the old george  bought him a new one but i have the old george because he he collects puppets so to his museum  is all the old george wow he told otto it's like it's just too ratty get rid of this he goes i'll 
[02:46:30]  buy you a brand new one let me have the old one so it's like a ten thousand dollar yeah i think  really yeah i got it yeah wow and he traveled with it he wrapped the head in like just a towel i mean you  know he had to be careful that was his fucking livelihood yeah yeah really he used to carry him  duffel bag back in the day i remember that he's just having a duffel bag over his shoulder yeah  when he was out he told me that he did not have control we weren't allowed to call him a puppet we  it was a live action doll or something he had like a special name for it oh really yeah he didn't like 
[02:47:00]  he did not like when uh because on the set we were like okay let's you know get the pup and he got  like uh you know he was like hey that's not you know he told people like no dude he's like a live  action so you know so yeah he was like a living part of him i mean we can all agree on that that  like he really would reference him and like you know make sure that he was okay and like i have  to put him in a special place and all that kind of stuff so you know it was definitely part part of  him you know and he would never he would never take george out for people like that was a running  joke with us to take george out we would always say that because it was just people would always say 
[02:47:30]  that to him like how's george doing and he would want to spit on them all right all right you know he's  he was just so yeah yeah short-tempered sometimes and he wanted to just get high and get out of  there you would call him his little wooden friend oh yeah otto and his little wooden buddy george  because he hated that yeah because it's vince d'antona who was a great ventriloquist yeah  that's how he liked to be introduced he was a nicer act he would close vince d'antona's closing  bit was e-i-e-i-o and he would see he would sing the old mcdonald had a farm 
[02:48:00]  i'm not funny handsome but this was you know whatever he was an old school funny he was an  old school guy yeah no he was yeah i love this this was great and vince would kill yeah but it was a  nicer it was a nicer relationship vince did never tell him to fucking kill himself he didn't ever  say sweat you danish junkie or you're in motel george ever said that to vince his george um but  the auto would hate when people would say take george out they want to talk to the public where's 
[02:48:30]  george yeah okay i used to love to because he was always so awkward with people afterwards when they  would like want to talk to him and he'd go okay we'll go to lunch and he would like make these plans  of people that i knew he was never going to keep and he would always shake their hand and his hand  was bent like because it was so stiff that it actually bent away from him the other way you know  when you put your hands straight out it bends so he would do that and his hand would bend and i'm  like you just gave them the fucking bent handshake you fake yeah obligated to shake a hand okay yeah 
[02:49:00]  okay just trying to get them away all right good thank you so uncomfortable oh this sucks hey when  he was on the road did he ever like do the merch table or anything because i i think he you're right  man he was kind of like a germaphobe he was very like introverted did he ever have to do that meet  and greet kind of thing afterwards yeah sometimes he would have his dvds uh he had a d yeah a lot of  times if he was mad at the crowd he wouldn't go out there he's like them i'm gonna want to see them  and he wouldn't go out and sell but i i saw him sell it like half the time he would try he would 
[02:49:30]  have dvds to sell it was a live act but then he also had these movies that he did uh was it american  dummies on me tell it tell a tubbies he had a really good right he's got a dvd out of like like six  hours or eight hours of his stuff yeah that he did over the years that he was selling to it towards  the end christmas one yeah that night before christmas one he always did these things with the with the  the puppet and um you know they were fairly well done for you know so low budget and just you know  shoestring kind of budget are they on his website uh yeah you can probably see some of them there 
[02:50:00]  or it yeah the last one i forget what it's called but it has all this stuff from his whole career on  there i think the alcohol send me a link of that i want i want i think it's just on auto and george.com  i'll check i'll find it for you dave thank you i gotta go guys i really apologize for not being  there in person but thanks for letting me in all right you're a busy guy yeah that moment i just  wanted uh jim yes if there's any kind of like anything that needs you know to be done or some  kind of more i'd love to be a part of it any way can help man this is this is like too much sadness  like uh you know it's it's it's horrible loss so yeah all right absolutely then they all let you let

[03:10:30]  yeah you guys only get an hour a year but the reason we're having it at caroline's we wanted to have it  at a bigger venue right they actually said that we're building toward we're building towards  something bigger with that which means nothing i hate when people say that to me that we're  building towards something isn't it is it is what it is right i think 20 years you should have built  it already right yeah thank you so what's going to happen at 25 years you guys are going to have  it at gotham comedy club because that was a few extra seats than caroline's 25 years didn't you guys do

[03:15:00]  that don't have to cut anything too yeah or three yeah two would have been perfect  that would have been easy yeah real easy to do because we're just talking radio stories so one  hour 20 years one hour and you guys pre-signed posters but we're building towards something else  i can't wait to see that that is but i don't like that term building towards yeah  i'm i'm looking at florentina you don't like stuff like that either right that corporate  bullshit oh we're gonna be building towards something bigger

[03:16:30]  iphone if you got the white glove what is the white glove treatment we get everything what is that i got  a watch i got the new uh note three i could get tvs and i'm because they gave us they gave us a note  three and i don't feel like walking around with a plasma tv in my fucking pocket you know that  it's ridiculous i actually that phone i i that's the one that makes me want to switch  is that the that's the thing yeah and i don't i don't care it's big it fits my pocket so i don't  care it's great why wouldn't you want a bigger phone no i love what you don't want it bulky in 
[03:17:00]  your pocket you don't need a bigger walk around when it's not bulky look how thin it's gonna be  spraying it's lighter than the iphone and it takes up just as much space i'm not no one's throwing  a back out lifting a phone it doesn't matter it really isn't my left arm isn't bigger because  i've been holding my iphone i love a fucking florentine gets aggravated itself it makes very  logical so much sense look how lighter it is it's lighter than the iphone isn't it lighter than the  iphone you can't hold it up that long you know i gotta keep switching hands it's really light but 
[03:17:30]  you gotta have long fingers to get all the way over that's the problem you gotta use it's not a problem  though because they figured that out you could switch your style it's english hates that phone  oh yeah boy that sounds great i love that phone and i love the watch too i like the watch pretty  cool i'm not gonna wear the watch you will wear the one i'll wear the watch when i'm driving so  because you can do hand hands-free uh phone calls and stuff but i don't need the watch to  it's great you have a kid you're fucking just talking to your wrist i'll tell you something though  that it's just not as quick and intuitive as the iphone is i've used both oh you're gonna ruin our 
[03:18:00]  white gloves no no i i i i meant to make believe i meant for people um uh just make believe chinese  people roland is uh having a panic attack oh shit get the white glove treatment you're  fucking trashing it maybe i get a fucking shit glove treatment from anybody maybe the five will be  the one that uh you know the samsung five i can't wait that's what i was supposed to get it just came  out i know i was supposed to get one next i got it you're getting one i have it you don't give me a 
[03:18:30]  prototype one they're not the fucking prototype rocket the prototype of the phone  i uh the iphone five the iphone six coming out and it's bigger so there you go yeah it's bigger  which way matter wise again no it's six months whatever new phone you got sucks and then the  next one is the better one yeah i can't believe i had this one i heard something that was along with  this i don't know if it's true but they said that they've um for the watch that iphone supposedly 
[03:19:00]  coming out with that it's a wireless charging whoa which would be fucking great because the one  thing about the watch take i love leaving my watch on and not taking it off to have to take it off and  plug it in is the only thing that sucks that watches yeah you need enough with the watch enough  with the watch wireless charging you'll have a fucking watch everything you've said no you said  no to the iphone you said no to the fucking ipad i would wear something you said no to  fucking a twitter i remember twitter now you're addicted to followers i got

[03:20:00]  the time with a core i do have a house phone it doesn't have a cord though you don't think the  watch is the next thing no no what's your thoughts on the watch it's stupid it's just for  fucking high-tech nerds that you know need a new gadget every six months so they can go look  good yeah and then the next thing it's going to come out something it's going to be something  else it's going to be a headset and then you're going to walk around with the headset yeah the  guy yeah the watch wasn't that good i guarantee if you got the white glove treatment from samsung  you'd have that no i wouldn't i don't give a shit what if they made it in black i got sponsored my 
[03:20:30]  podcast i still love it this is stupid you what these razors are stink they're really not that good  you can't fucking trash your sponsors i don't care i like them i tried them they're not good  i'm like the razors i like the razors which razors i mean i i do uh i do uh i don't like  their attempt at comedy but i like their product i thought the i thought the commercial they did  was very funny yeah you didn't do the commercial they did for the no the one where he's what it's  fucking very funny stop it but their razors are terrific i like liddell's commercial for that 
[03:21:00]  fucking battery car battery yeah it's funny comes out he fucking grabs i know by the horn and swings  around he's fucking kicking ass in that one it's a pretty good commercial which commercial maybe i  i didn't see the commercial you're talking about dollar shave club the new one oh i was talking  about a different oh i know i'm talking about mine i love no i got a different oh yeah what where's  your watch where's your uh i didn't get i don't have a white glove treatment so if i had it you want  to watch so how do you know it's good then tell them just tell them your lord varies i've i've i got 
[03:21:30]  the first one it's called i'm watch i got it like a year and a half ago i was into this shit and  but you're not wearing it now though no it's like i said the battery is the worst thing about  it you gotta plug it in so that's why just that alone it should come with a long cord so you just  have to keep it plugged into your wrist everywhere you go it just automatically what feeds out as  you're driving a four mile fucking cord drive to work with it you think that you think that would be  a bust yeah that would product you think that would do how do they do wireless charging this is the 
[03:22:00]  holy grail of fucking charging i i wasn't i think it was invented a lot and i could be wrong because i'm  you know how does it transfer i think it was invented a long time ago by tesla it came up with  it a long time ago well yeah and now they're they're actually trying to work it out like they have the  case you can put on your phone and just throw it on the table that is some right but there's got to  be some type of contact that's what i read but it's all all apple shit right now is all you know  it could be true it could be not and it's coming from certain guys that have been right in the past about 
[03:22:30]  the new stuff that's coming out uh-huh but it still could be all horseshit yeah because the  power power putting power from one place to another without wires is like that's the thing  people are trying to do forever solar power no but you can't you can't then get power and transfer  it from point a to point b without some type of they do it with microwaves but it's like crazy  dangerous no you can't just be beaming microwave energy through people's neighborhoods  i just had to spit sorry i'll figure it out yeah maybe some kind of like a tire that can 
[03:23:00]  absorb sunlight you have to roll the tire to your friend's house and throws his phone in the tire  that seems very inconvenient i don't think that's really because if you were able to get to put  solar panels up in space where there's no problem with the atmosphere clouds or anything like that  you could keep it in a rotation where it stays facing the sun and just being the energy energy down  to earth yeah problem fucking solved yeah problem solved yeah but it's getting that energy so if  they could have a watch didn't they just discover some new thing graphene did you hear about that 
[03:23:30]  graphene graphene new yeah it's yo graphene it's um it conducts energy better than anything and it's  flexible like that's how we're going to get flexible screens oh i did see that yeah yeah i'm sure  there's a nerd i was watching some science show and i saw that yeah they got it from the tip of a  pencil yes they just basically found it by accident like graphite oh yeah yeah it's stronger than  steel all this fucking crazy shit so yeah what do you what are you what are you gonna watch tv on 
[03:24:00]  your pencil what are you talking about ah regular joe what's the matter well you still got a tv with a  tube right yeah i get the old school it's been going out of 1988 i got a smash regular joe with an  iphone 6 cable whatever i'm good with the aerial i have a regular i put the rabbit ears on top a  little piece of furl yeah i put the movies in the vcr i watch them what are you watching tv on your  pencil bobby that fucking phone though you can you can write the number write the number with the 
[03:24:30]  and it puts it in the contacts how great is that into digital it's not that great you can just type it  right in with your fingers what's your number seven three two four nine nine 53 38 no problem i don't  need to write it i'm not excited that i can write it you could write you could write an address you  could write an address by hand in there and then just hit the map and the 
[03:25:00]  you don't need toys get some mud get some water and make a truck you get some steaks there's a house  right because then you write the number maybe you don't you can't read what you wrote right  six months later when you look at is that a four or six no no no you don't understand it transfers  it into into regularly that's it's like no one should be excited over that thank you  that doesn't make you excited no turkey chili's here bob he goes he knows how to work that he was  told jesus christ never to touch the tip of the spoon but did you get a spoon diva that's it 
[03:25:30]  do you live in the dark why are you so pale  he doesn't sleep in jersey looks like fucking milk are you sleeping better  it's a fucking guy jesus christ you don't think it's your red is your fucking eye sockets  he doesn't he doesn't sleep up uh in may but i'm coming back again sorry oh  in may  back in the summer oh david copperfield's gonna be calling in a few minutes this guy wants in on 
[03:26:00]  uh tech talk uh justin in texas oh my god i like turkey chili i was just calling to uh  tell you guys where anthony was talking about if he's in the car you can't adjust the nav while you're  driving down the road and if you have a passenger what does your car know right yeah so on all of  your new 2015 models and i know you're an escalade man anthony uh it will sense a passenger in the seat  or put a heavy enough bag and you can adjust your nav while you're driving down the road ah so you say 
[03:26:30]  why can't it be voice activated uh well it is voice activated too but when you're down here in texas  half of us can't speak well enough for the car to understand it anyway to do redneck and regular  english yeah yeah well regular english or whatever but the other thing was you're talking about how  you're going to charge things wirelessly so you know like the chevrolet bolt actually generates  power for those batteries just based on breaking in the centrifugal force so maybe yeah but again  that's a that's a closed circuit right there you're you're using um actually a resistance 
[03:27:00]  from a uh from a coil like a generator as brakes but in the same sense just like a watch can charge  off the motion of your wrist your what your your phone can do the same thing kind of like how it  counts paces as you walk oh so you're saying the motion of your wrist and stuff would generate some  type of uh electricity to charge to your power right your your direct current between those goals  and things like that you all right well that would be okay okay i thought maybe energy was being 
[03:27:30]  beamed somewhere so you have to move your wrist so basically a paraplegic would get no use out of  this watch unless somebody in the hospital picked up his arm and angrily banged on your chair yours  would overcharge every night exactly yeah i know he'd be carrying a fucking neutron bomb on my right  fully charged he could run he could run a charging charging service i know unless it's a  charging station to stop by his apartment by here i'll pick it up in a half hour  right and the other thing oh all right go ahead sorry the other thing being an escalator anthony is 
[03:28:00]  in the in your new 15 if you go get one they have this adaptive cruise control have you seen this  thing yeah but no what is that so you can set your cruise control it'll break and speed you up  yes five miles an hour to 70 miles an hour you never have to touch your brakes yeah i would  that depending on um traffic in front of me and no it has no sense at all it's just it just judges by 
[03:28:30]  the time of day by sunlight but the other part of that system is is it actually reads the road lines  of the lanes on the road and will tell you if you're drifting in the lanes and various i would  love to talk to you further about this but we have a phone call coming in that we must take very  important go for it yes thank you sir talking to you guys all right buddy thanks for the information  like that uh for the first time on our show david copperfield yeah hey david hey guys how you doing  hey david how you doing jim florentine here yeah we got uh bob kelly jim florentine jim norton anthony 
[03:29:00]  and myself opie and we're uh we're all devastated by uh the passing of auto shocked right yeah  yeah that's not good but uh how did you first come to know auto because i know he was actually he  loved the fact that you guys were friends he spoke very highly of you thank you well we both had the  same inspiration you know we both and i didn't know him when he was just you guys knew him probably  in the very beginning but i didn't know him after until he was famous until he really established  himself i didn't know him during the street performer days or all that you know i knew after 
[03:29:30]  he was really famous and in fact you know turn me on to uh otto is kevin spacey believe it or not  wow kevin spacey kevin spacey was a big otto and george fan okay we heard this  how's that do you know that i did not know that no i didn't know that either no someone  uh what doesn't matter but yeah i heard that before yeah he loved him and and he was playing  in new york you got to see him and i heard some of my crew you know loved his work and played me  some video of him i thought it was pretty pretty amazing stuff at that moment was starting to be you 
[03:30:00]  know noteworthy and and um so i went to see his show obviously and it was it was incredible and um  and uh uh you know after we started talking we realized we have the same influences both as kids  we're similar age which kind of sucks um yeah right he he um he said you know his influence was  paul winchell and i don't know if you guys remember paul winchell paul was a huge tv star when when we 
[03:30:30]  were kids winchell mahoney and paul winchell was the ventriloquist who's who's the voice of tigger  in the old and all right so all that sound is that kind of this tigger and paul winchell  yeah paul winchell and jerry mahoney and that was his influence and that was my influence too  i was a ventriloquist when i was a kid winchell mahoney time exactly you're googling the other way  you're google fingers no no i swear i really remember that he's actually eating turkey chili anthony's  just really old but no but uh you know i started doing ventriloquism and i totally sucked 
[03:31:00]  it because i couldn't do it my act is out of the back of a boy's life in a magazine nobody laughed  and uh i found magic but in otto's case he really found uh a voice you know pardon me he found a  voice he found a voice of how to do that and and and a kind of a repartee that became distinctive to  him yeah and really had that ability and uh you know as i got to know him i realized not from him he  never talked about this but but you know he's one of the most ripped off guys around yeah oh yeah 
[03:31:30]  and and and some famous people who i won't mention the name of but you'll know who it is  like literally became famous on his material i mean really became famous on it and and stuff that he  developed and was amazing and for a magician you know that's what i do by the way oh yeah and when  when when when when when when the magic world if somebody if somebody you know rips off what i'm  doing it's devastating because i spend years on each each thing so i ask how do i think you know so 
[03:32:00]  and so got really famous on your act how did you deal with that i mean how do you do that and he would  say it's okay it's you know i was done with it it's all right now what are you kidding i mean you  know this person's enormously famous and he's using your material that you developed oh it's okay it's all  right oh my god this guy was a really giving guy that really was was okay with with all that kind  of roll with the punches and didn't you know get pissed off at this kind of thing yeah yeah amazing  amazing stuff and i know you guys know i'm talking about it's like incredible you have the original 
[03:32:30]  george too right or why not the original but one of the more recent before the new one i got one of  the i mean the original i mean all the georges were kind of the train wrecks you know there was the  whole point he he wanted a a really beautiful figure and and um i feel okay i'll help you  because i have all these friends and and and the world of kind of side world of ventriloquism and  magic and i had a guy that could build a really beautiful george that we can't if you build another 
[03:33:00]  george for yourself and i help you with this it's got to be kind of screwed up it's got to be kind of  you know a little bit screwy looking no no i want a beautiful george and sort of the point of your  act it's for it to look a little bit screwed up you know right no no i want this beautiful okay so  i got this beautiful uh thing then he he donated to a museum that i kind of curate that i i have that  is uh uh this you know this this figure that you know you're is the one that's known you know the 
[03:33:30]  one that you've seen all the pictures where it's kind of carved together and you know what's kind of  of beautiful in a way is that uh hit the deal this will george is in my museum right next to  our inspiration you know paul winchell and jerry mahoney's stuff all the winchell family has  uh allowed me to kind of oh you got that stuff too wow yeah so he came one of the great moments  you know in in that he said in his life was he came really past a couple years to uh my place in 
[03:34:00]  a museum in las vegas and just looking at you know all edgar bergen edgar bergen and charlie mccarthy  and uh howdy doody and uh um you know all these iconic characters and paul winchell and jerry mahoney  stuff and all the records and there's and there's george you know sitting there with all the stuff  and he like starts to cry you know seeing all the stuff it's like this resting place for his his uh  you know one of his original georgia so it's kind of a a beautiful thing and what's really remarkable 
[03:34:30]  about it is that a lot of people who are in our business that come and see this stuff not only  magic but the ventriloquism stuff they go in there and they see you know all these iconic uh sherry lewis  remember sherry lewis oh yeah and then i have the puppets from the twilight zone there's a couple of  ventriloquism oh yeah and and uh they're there and then they turn the corner and they see george  on his public oh my god that's george the most unlikely people you'd never imagine are familiar 
[03:35:00]  with otto and george's work and they go wow it's very good twilight zone and george so it's really he  made an amazing mark and it makes me really really really feeling so warm that he did  such a you know uh a great thing for uh this this the world of ventriloquism and comedy and you  know all the all the you know penn and teller love and i just people really love this guy so yeah david 
[03:35:30]  when was the first time you saw otto live where yeah where were you he said chevin spacey took you  but where was it it was in new york i think it was uh what's downstairs in right off time square  that's carolines or what was that yes carolines yeah yeah and um yeah so i'm live there first and  uh uh you know he came to vegas i think in the past year i had him come here just to perform for our  crew you know believe it or not so and he just you know it was he got sober and all that kind of stuff 
[03:36:00]  he's you know it was a really it was a really good trip and seeing and seeing all the the you know his  figures and his pictures and so forth and little display we made for him is a really good one i'm  totally shocked yeah yeah he was doing really well too you know i just tweeted uh bob levy tweeted i  retweeted this video of him in your uh i guess museum and you showing you showing him the puppets oh wow  so there's actually some video of that online i guess on facebook so uh i retweeted that i i haven't 
[03:36:30]  seen it yet i'm going to watch it at the end of the show oh absolutely that's great man well i'm  sorry guys it's just kind of a sucky way of uh meeting in the morning yeah it is yeah we got it  but i mean he really uh he was highly of you and family should be really proud of him family amazing  proud of him you know the the the the you know obviously he he just was the material is extremely  dirty which is the most awesome thing in the world he has looked so well and his family should know that 
[03:37:00]  you know the the the the most you know uh really respected oscar-winning people watch this and  like wow this is really cool something about it just the way he would turn the phrase you know a  galliano bottle you know yeah yeah right exactly okay you know paper plate is what words he would  use which is like oh just so well chosen comedically well chosen he had an amazing grasp on uh on on  using violent language in comedy like but violent and look stephen king made a tremendous living using 
[03:37:30]  violent language well and i know did it brilliantly in in comedy was was these these amazing images of  people's skulls being cracked open but the funny part was that he used an ashtray or just these these  odd things used to commit violent acts and he had such a great mastery of the language yeah and just  and everything just the craftsmanship you know i'm you know it's weird to hear a magician talk about  comedy craftsmanship but i care about all that and i you know i follow you know all of the the 
[03:38:00]  greats and he was a group just great and you guys are experts at it you know everybody on the phone  with me here you just know just it's the choice of how he phrased it how he did it was yeah genius  kind of genius you have a porcelain sink yeah yeah and then he had that famous he had that famous line  because i want to fuck you in the ass with a santa with a santa hat on it was always why why would  a santa hat on it was so in it or or literally otto be minding his own business just saying something 
[03:38:30]  and george would just interrupt him and go you know every time you talk this show sucks i'm gonna  fuck you in the ass until there's blood in your shoes yeah i'm like what what a great image that is  like that that's a fucking poem like to fucking someone in the ass is harsh right yeah but until  there's blood in your that means it went all the way down your thighs over your calves and collected  in your shoes a whole new level that's a harsh ass fucking oh my god david copperfield's last  that's brutality but he really understood that he just knew how to write brilliant material like that 
[03:39:00]  and amazing lines in its own it's his own way yeah poetry yeah well thank you david we appreciate it  you can see david every night the hollywood theater at the mgm oh don't do that set that out  we might as well seven nine o'clock i've actually worked in that room with david tell when you when  you weren't there it's an amazing space i've seen david's show a couple times phenomenal phenomenal  show all right forget about that you didn't call in for a plug we wanted to call in for that yeah

[04:03:00]  it was just shredded it felt like you burned your mouth with hot hot soup yeah do they still make  captain crunch oh yeah captain crunch captain i think it was always captain crunch he's got a  admiral crunch admiral crunch got a promotion constant but what happened was i flew up to um  canada and i woke up in a hospital in new jersey oh man are you kidding wait and you have no memory of  i lost eight days up there i i was on i i had an inner ear ear infection and i was i have an inflection 
[04:03:30]  in my ear i can't hear you yeah i right fucking call me young that's your beloved yeah but um wait so  you have these weird dreams when i was on that michael jackson that i was combative at the airport  and they wouldn't let me into canada they took me to the emergency room i don't remember any of this  what did you say that wait wait wait could i slow you down you had an inner ear infection  i flew with an inner ear infection i was taking illegal painkillers and so i didn't realize how  sick i was how about an illegal penicillin yeah trish tried to get me to go to the emergency room and i 
[04:04:00]  just wanted to get to the gig and go to sleep at the hotel i would have died if i went to sleep no  shit yeah i had a blood it was in my blood and i got uh bacterial meningitis and then uh so i was  on that michael jackson and knocked me out with that i have no memory propofol how did you get this  do you know how how you get it or well that was my achilles heel i used to get earaches during my  childhood like a lot but i hadn't had one in years but i thought when i woke up in jersey i thought i was 
[04:04:30]  shot encounter i had this vivid uh dream of being shot in a club by some gangsters like like uh like gang  banger type guys and i kept asking the doctors was i shot and then when they extra x-rayed me at  one point i asked them if i had any bullets in me i still thought i was shot and then i said did i  miss the frank sinatra show and trish goes what are you talking about i said frank sinatra did a benefit  to get me uh better didn't he and she goes he's been dead you know that right i actually had a dream of 
[04:05:00]  sinatra being at the club you were like tony soprano and he was fucking laying in the hospital  weird and and i also dreamt that i was on this this train i i knew that i was laying down i wasn't  like sitting up i had you know i i was aware of that but i was on this train that was uh that was  like going somewhere and there were like these uh rodeo clowns were jumping off this train and they  were being sprayed by a hose and like falling off the train and running across this field very weird 
[04:05:30]  weirdness how disappointing is it to think sinatra did a benefit and then you wake up and realize it  was levy that's great that's great it was fucked up so you don't remember eight days i don't remember  anything in canada at all they got a private plane for me to come back and all that and what are you  doing in the airport did she say like how are you being combative like with the customs people well  first i threw up in line at newark i just suddenly ralphed and everybody scattered and then and  instead of like uh checking me out or something they took me to the head of the line so i can get 
[04:06:00]  through security get him get him through fast yeah yeah they just put me on the plane and uh i i just  became combative at uh customs i don't remember what i did or anything just probably obnoxious  so so wait i thought they wouldn't let you into canada um no they they wouldn't let me just wander  the streets i they they uh red flagged me and took me to the emergency room and i was took like four  guys to hold me down and they just put that propofol down my throat holy i don't remember that part 
[04:06:30]  either i was reeling with this earache i was yeah you must have had like poison blood fever i hadn't  been inside of a hospital since i was like 13 so it was weird right right and then when i woke up there  was all these guys with masks and gowns i thought i was dying for sure holy my sister was there my brother  came in from philadelphia so you're like yeah they don't just show up my sister look the look on her  face is like i had already died and and uh i didn't want to go to sleep because i didn't think i was 
[04:07:00]  going to wake up and they were giving me all this um xanax and nothing would work i was up for oh and  also i couldn't hear anybody it was like i was underwater that kind of deafness but that went away my  hearing is actually better now really since the illness yeah the only thing was i had a like uh my legs  were like jello when i what when i you know because when you don't move for eight days your muscles  turn to guacamole it only takes eight days yeah oh yeah that's unbelievable an olympic athlete would 
[04:07:30]  have been the same you stand up and you it's like a newborn giraffe you pitch forward you know so they  had to like they had to watch me like step in and out of a tub before they let me go home they had to  know that i could walk around the apartment without like killing myself and stuff like that isn't that ironic  you had fucking legs like george that's true yeah flopping around cloth puppet legs  yeah how many days were you in the hospital auto what did they do no how many days damn i was in 
[04:08:00]  the jersey shore hospital for about four or five days and then they moved me to this rehabilitation  place in red bank the guy in the in the bed next to me uh had um turned a motor motorcycle over it  like it took down like 50 feet of a fence oh every bone in his body was shattered and they were giving  him sorry they were giving him like the best drugs like oxycontin and all that because he was he had  broken bones and i was and trish told everybody that i had a propensity for drug abuse or whatnot 
[04:08:30]  uh and i couldn't get anything you know they were just giving me like advil and my the headache was  unbearable that gave me morphine unbearable yeah the one time i actually needed painkillers they  wouldn't give me yeah yeah yeah it was pretty ugly um but like i said i was never sick before and it  was just it just came out of nowhere and they don't know exactly how you get that stuff it's like did  that kill jerry red wilson or was his the other meningitis yeah he got that in hawaii yeah he was dead 
[04:09:00]  before he got back to la i think yeah yeah he was a comic i don't know if you guys remember jerry  i know the name yeah he was he was he was arising and he got a meningitis and on the flight i think  they said he shouldn't have flown yeah and his girlfriend said he woke up during the flight and  started making no sense and we're babbling and then just i guess he used to play at the fast eddies  a lot of me yeah he was a good guy um no they said one in four people die from what i had but  fuck it i got lucky but i don't i don't see like a new world like i didn't gain that wisdom from a 
[04:09:30]  brush with death it's just i feel like um i'm gonna go through this again and it'll  fucking do me in next time like i live to die another day like that right like cynical about  it some people say that you're not scared to die after you go through something like that  well if you see a white light maybe yeah yeah maybe get a hint of what's next that's for sure  hospitals suck they don't give a fuck about you there they really don't it's their business  it's their business you're just a number they're watching saturday night live and you're  screaming they're just annoyed that you're screaming yeah what about that weird moment 
[04:10:00]  though when you're walking by when you when you're walking in the nurse said auto  have you been giving your medication to jim  it's wrong to want to be alone yeah i'm not going to use auto's head yeah florentine came and saw me a  lot yeah yeah i couldn't get rid of that guy he was like three times yeah i didn't know he liked 
[04:10:30]  me that much it was really nice of him that's cool do you know who this man is this is auto men are  coming here to kill him yeah jim just stood there with his hands shaking trying to light a cigarette  in the front after they threw his flowers out that fruit yes i want to take rocious food they give you  can't taste anything the eggs sucked it's horrible man you must appreciate food more now you're  about like better food that you have to eat that garbage yeah just appreciate you know you know  everything at home and not being you know talking to doctors ask me the same they kept asking me 
[04:11:00]  questions like do you know what state you're in do you know who the president is they wanted to see  how fucked up i was yeah yeah you know holy how long were you in rehab that was like seven days i got  the nurse was really cool she goes you're the healthiest one here you're gonna i'm gonna get you  out of here quickly because there were people that were just dying like stroke victims and  shit we recovered very well i mean i know that can be a fucking disastrous uh end results but you  recovered so the whole thing was about what three weeks yeah probably prep probably the better part 
[04:11:30]  of a month june was just a blur you know and then when when they did the benefit for me i was like  really healthy it felt fraudulent you know yeah that guy looks fine what the fuck is this about  oxygen tank yeah yeah it felt fraudulent but that's because the hospital bills didn't start  coming in yet yeah yeah yeah you know now it comes in definitely handy you know jesus christ  all from a fucking ear infection yeah i found out i had terminal cancer and to make the 
[04:12:00]  co-payments i started selling crystal meth to teenagers it's wacky  well we're absolutely glad you're all right oh man cards and letters bigger and better than ever  okay here's the new and here's how you sell it here the new improved auto oh yeah no more potty  talk no more fun i know right oh nothing there there's no more chunk chunk  i was covered in gas 
[04:12:30]  wow that's a fucking ordeal that's a hell of a story damn up how was that strip club  you did because i had a tough time there but do they like you more horrible you know i had to go on  at like 1 1 30 in the morning oh yeah it's fucked up did they cry with it was a crowd responsive uh  they were yeah there was some there was a couple of like like oh a coke logic came okay with four  other fat pale friends they ignored the strippers completely and just sat there from eight to one in 
[04:13:00]  the morning to see me i felt bad for them so you know i asked the owner could you buy them some appetizers  some spring rolls or something you know they're not into the strippers and they're not drinking booze  and they're just sitting there you know that's like tossing whales a popcorn shrimp  really yeah that was the chicago gig yeah i just did one night there and it was tough  it is it was nice but it was just it's not you know it's a strip i don't understand the the 
[04:13:30]  combination of strip club and comedian it's like you know you're not guys that go in  in a strip club want to see fucking new different animals and if you're you're there to see a  comedian then you're going to be annoyed having some girl pawn you're trying to get 20 bucks one  of the owner's sensibility he likes variety right he goes i'm trying to bring like a french vegas like  you know cirque du slay and that bullshit good but i mean like abbott and costello started in burlesque  burlesque was the girl could not show her nipple they would have to be a covering a tassel 
[04:14:00]  uh-huh and then then some baggy pants comic and that was what burlesque was baggy pants  comic yeah yeah that's what they were i guess back then yeah yeah yeah how did they how did they  get laughs back then that must have been they couldn't curse or it had to be clean well they  knew they were going to see a knife throwing act and a comedian then a dancer twirling tassels it  wasn't too smart it was expected yeah okay that old school comedy was uh different yeah yeah it wasn't  no no no dirty talk no abbott and costello always worked clean even though you were allowed to be blue  in burlesque yeah yeah who were some of the people that came out of that you know i guess 
[04:14:30]  margaret bruce red red fox little lenny bruce wow red fox no i don't know before he was born in  jazz rooms and stuff he did a few strip joints oh yeah i'm sure he did but he was like the old  you think of vaudeville burlesque right but vaudeville was everything but uh there was a lady named  bell barth that was real dirty i think there's some albums of her somewhere yeah  yeah but uh lou costello had the sense he knew if he wanted a career just you know work clean even 
[04:15:00]  though it won't right no fucking tv will come calling or something movies yeah yeah yeah and  if your wife wants to get a pool cemented oh god oh god that's horrible oh my god that's terrible  yeah for an italian male to lose his firstborn son they said he never enjoyed a moment of life after  that really that was it i just took the joy out of his life he was just a robot after that and that  happened pretty early in there in his life i saw him talk about that in an interview like they 
[04:15:30]  actually asked him it was like back in the days when they didn't fucking when they would ask a  celebrity a question wow yeah i'm this is your life or whatever he talked about it what did he say  yeah i don't remember but he kind of gave the account and uh he was unemotional about it like you  you could see it was just you know i heard they could have saved him if he wasn't yelling gone  please call me  my kids in the  yeah  what about stinky 
[04:16:00]  that's funny  shit  wow that's there was a lot of that tragic old hollywood  shit well he was from paterson new jersey and and a swimming pool was a symbol of he's  and then this kid it was like a year old just crawled in there and the wife was like  putting a bottle of gin in a potted plant and hiding in front  she was like a sneak drinker and shit and they stayed married too because they were old school  catholics but yeah yeah yeah a lot of all that oh there must have been a hell of a 
[04:16:30]  fucking marriage after that oh my god yeah he's just blaming her for fucking not being there yeah  and no no safety with a child in a pool back down the fence you know the code to have a fence  that almost started like five years ago you don't watch that yeah and maybe did he ever have any  other kids stones did i what did yeah did he have any other kids yeah oh yeah he had he had daughters  his daughter yeah he had two daughters i mean voss inducted them abit costella to the new jersey 
[04:17:00]  hall of fame yeah so i met his daughters and uh i'm kidding abit too abit and costella as a team  yeah yeah a little homely the daughters i don't remember actually they couldn't be that i don't  i don't remember them being knockouts but i really don't remember well they've got to be really old  it's great i love those guys more and more when i watch them now yeah yeah timing yeah great and  abit was such a nasty prick cracking him in the face with a a heavy pinky ring for years and years 
[04:17:30]  he really was a yeah smacking a smack across the face is very uh really gets you angry after two or  three times if you just do that to yourself and he wouldn't even give him a chance he'd walk right  up and just smack him wow and uh costello was a golden gloves boxer he was a tough he was just  tough could have beat the shit out of him oh yeah and one time i saw him punch uh abit on an old like  kinescope with milton burrell like he gave him just one too many and and i saw him punch him right in 
[04:18:00]  the upper arm here with the bone and the flesh separate and you saw um the the blood drain out of  abit's face it looked like it could hurt i mean costello had a hand the size of a microwave oven  finally got him yeah yeah he just had he never would have thought he was a tough guy very tough  he was as tough as any mafioso he was just a comedian wow man yeah yeah because in every  days every movie and stuff he's that you know hat in his hands and rolling the brim of the head yeah 
[04:18:30]  well yeah he's playing a five-year-old child you know basically he was five when him and stinky  would interact i thought they were two five-year-olds it's brilliant yeah yeah all pissed at each other  over dumb shit yeah god that was just some weird time that that was uh yeah that was actually  entertaining it i mean it is now to watch but it's there's also a nostalgia part of it now but that  was just that was what they went to i mean it's a movie it does it does a lot of that 
[04:19:00]  shit holds up their movies was too much of a subplot there'd be some romantic subplot and too much  singing with the andrews yes the tv show boiled all that shit down yeah just their comedy for a half  hour you ever see the three stooges yeah awesome too yeah yeah they said um lou got a lot of his  shit from watching curly a lot of his oh really high high pitched voice and a lot of his mannerisms but i  i think they're both geniuses yeah yeah yeah yeah it's strange that uh do you enjoy curly joe 
[04:19:30]  no no joe besser joe besser i disliked more than curly joe because he wouldn't let oh i thought  they're the same person oh no that was yeah yeah joe besser was stinky and he took over for shemp  but he like said larry could never slap me and mo can only slap me three times for short he had some  fucking rule like that it's like play wasn't he the i'm gonna give you such a pinch yeah i'll harm  you yeah you hated him i loved him as stinky but i didn't think he was he he wasn't on board to be in 
[04:20:00]  the studio he had to get slapped every five seconds and then it's curly curly joe curly joe was just like  a fat boring curly look-alike yeah yeah nothing didn't work at all tiny they were tiny guys they  were all like five one they were really the guy who played curly in that movie looked like a linebacker  he's way too big oh in the movie yeah what's his name he's on the vine all the time oh yeah will sasso  fine imitating him but he's just not the right that was a better movie than i thought it would be though 
[04:20:30]  it really was funnier than i thought it was the thing i liked about it was that they broke it up so it  looked like you were watching three shorts shorts yeah yeah that was a good idea that they did that  that was the guy that did larry was was really good yeah he was a great larry he was awesome job  sounded like him but i was just ashamed to go see it in the theater because but why watch this you  could just watch the original watch the boys you know yeah those movies still exist yeah on dvd they look  great hold hands you lovebirds oh yeah one of my favorite moments is when shemp is on a ladder 
[04:21:00]  and i forget what it's mo and he's handing him like a fucking like a or something a wallpaper hang  that looks like a broom or whatever yeah and i don't know why he did it but he took it and he just  fucking jammed it up into his face  right under his fucking nose like just a horrible you know that was an improv yeah i'm sure they said  fuck you and they must have hit they must have hit each other sometimes those things like  accidentally did you ever see the one where it's curly it's a shemp it's no but curly is in it with longer 
[04:21:30]  hair oh it was post-stroke curly oh it's called hold that lion there it's they're on a train and  curly curly's sleeping under a derby and and uh they wake him up and it's the only time the three  brothers appeared together wow it's a shemp it's called hold that lion and you get to see curly  with his hair grown in and he but he's thin and sick it's supposed to be him or he's supposed to  you're not supposed to know it's well he's supposed to be a man sleeping on a train but he does one  like curly moment he does like like a one of these those arm things yeah oh god that is sad to the 
[04:22:00]  audience what did he die of he had many strokes and he died at 52. wow but he spent like like the  last 10 years just sitting in a chair you know it's fucking sad all those smacks to the head i don't  know now probably bad diet you know probably lived on pastrami and bourbon watch it down with  cigarettes yeah i'm surprised you dropped dead at that age they didn't know yeah they didn't know 
[04:22:30]  back then that's like what happened if like fred mertz too right he just dropped on fucking hollywood  boulevard yeah outside uh movie premiere yeah yeah you did you gotta take the death tour when you go to  la it's the best hey rick to actually point and show you where he died yeah it's good to him though  he he was unhirable because he was a bad alcoholic yeah he said i'll give you the job but you can't  fuck it up you know he gave him a chance what was he pals with him before or something he probably knew 
[04:23:00]  him from a lot of movies yeah 150 movies who was william probably yeah william for all he was  one of those guys that was always in shit miracle on 34th street that movie fucking stunk but you  dead you hated hated that bad acting really i don't know is santa gonna be there oh it's  fucking who's that the janitor that becomes friends with all of them it was just chris kringle  but that was the style back then i know but it ended badly with them dumping the letters and i  hated that movie i was just saying the letters oh yeah chris kringle was a fucking it was so full 
[04:23:30]  of hope right but yeah but fake hope it didn't make me feel anything i was just like oh all these  people who changed the acting you think brando was a big thing it was brando that really changed it  to how we know it today in the public because when the movies first started they came from all  the broadway fucking stages so they right they just acted differently well john garfield they  said there's a link to that anti-hero stuff he played a lot of like dislikable guys but you like  them anyway widmark too seemed to act a little bit differently rich widmark in the 40s didn't seem 
[04:24:00]  to act like the rest of them that over the top acting yeah that you know was a real psychopath it  didn't feel like like the rest of the people in kiss of death were like i want to just stow it  tommy yeah yeah yeah a lot of that bad acting you're talking about had to do with the the microphones  back then really sucked especially in the early 30s uh-huh that you know the the to the uh the  the tape recorder was the size of a like a truck you know like a mail truck yeah yeah yeah so you had  to speak louder walk into a room and really out there and not knowing how to go from stage to film 
[04:24:30]  yeah like that's a lot stage acting a lot smaller ah yeah yeah they knew they thought that's how you  do it that's how you do it yeah yeah yeah there's a lot more subtle just putting this on film instead  of you know on film yeah a lot more subtlety film stars are weird are weird they always have a big  head and a small body yes the big stars are always like that big head you fucking we had a guy mike shannon  and yesterday michael shannon his head was giant he was a very intense guy yeah is that the guy from uh  boardwalk empire and fucking he played played yeah what was he like great he was funny but real 
[04:25:00]  real deadpan a very intense very intense looking and he was like the ice man guy he is oh yeah he  wasn't acting he wasn't acting much for that role because he's that guy but he had a very dry sense  of humor yeah it was pretty fun it was fun yeah yeah and he sounded like steven wright a lot of  people uh pointed that out budget on boardwalk empire just for costumes must be three million a  week there he is right it's the detail of that there is yeah he's a crazy that's him trying to  smile he is three of us in the picture he looks like jaws yeah i was gonna say he he looks like 
[04:25:30]  jaws one twisted chromosome away from giantism yeah yeah that's a weird dude oh man he was great  and uh he was like an ice man kuklinski did you see it i didn't see it yeah so that guy was a mountain  of a man you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and what a fucking just savage i think i think he exaggerated  his i think so too that's all he had at the end was yeah like i want to be the toughest guy in history 
[04:26:00]  you know yeah yeah but he i mean he was he was doing that poisoning people and yeah the blatant  fucking hacking people up he opened up a fucking hat shop and he planted bombs in the hats  yeah so people put the hat on and two hours later the bomb would go off that happened to me  it was with the ice cream man guy that uh they would go around and they kill people and freeze  them they put them in fucking freezers for like two years yeah and then two years later they take 
[04:26:30]  them out of the freezer dump them really fucking far away and they'd find them but it was like they  wouldn't know they wouldn't know how when he died right or shit like that so it'd fuck the entire  or any kind of case they were trying to build against so smart great so put them on ice for  chips in the guy's heart they go what the fuck is this yeah they ice in this someone they found a  little too soon after they dumped him and that's kind of how they they figured like all right this  guy was killed a while ago well they got him talking on on tape yes killing people you know and then 
[04:27:00]  work how can you argue with yeah once you'd start doing that more than like dommer and those guys  because they were insane right crazy fucking evil prick yeah bad guy yeah what an evil guy and then  trying to just you know lead his little family life he has his kids and his wife and and then he'd go  out and just commit brutality on people and then the way he just kind of brags about it on those interviews  one mob boss he was working for that he drove him to manhattan and they would saw an old man walking 
[04:27:30]  his dog and he just goes cap that guy yeah and he just walked up and shot him and he never knew if  that was somebody he was mad at or just some poor schmuck just that yeah roy de mayo made him do that  yeah he's one of us that's keep the cops uncle fucking people keep the cops uncle was roy de mayo  yeah really oh yeah oh shit yesterday we were looking at a picture of him and going holy  it looks it looks like it looks like he wow that's right it was frightening is he like a scary guy 
[04:28:00]  you think i mean do you see signs of a temperature well good thing if he became a cop he could take  it out on the fucking skills of manhattan oh my god the skills yeah yeah you know getting back to  costello for a second someone just tweeted me he won 32 fights before he got knocked out yeah really  here's the real fucking deal is there pictures did he just run around the ring and have the guy chase him  is there not i was boxing there's no there's no footage of him boxing is there probably not 
[04:28:30]  no they wouldn't use like an irish name like lou christie or something like hey i don't know  lee oh there's a new costello that boxes look at this fucking oh holy shit that guy  it's like the frito bandito i don't know yeah uh then  and this shit from movies yeah but no real uh real pictures any old photos boxing huh sick gambler  too all those guys oh they would play like fifty thousand dollar hands of poker between shooting 
[04:29:00]  scenes wow yeah they were degenerates yeah must have been quite the life back then you know no no no  fucking cameras all around you could be as much of a degenerate as you want without worrying  worrying about some fan with a fucking phone in your face that's true yeah yeah when he died  costello and abbott was in the 70s yeah abbott died late but yeah but he like he died broke he had to  live in his sister's attic and shit get the fuck out of here costello at least you know dropped dead 
[04:29:30]  before the government took everything from wow oh you know your shit auto yeah you really know your  history yeah these guys these old bastards i love these old bastards yeah what year was costello  died he died in the 60s he died i think in like 58 or something like that oh wow before this atrocious  last movie came out called the 30-foot bride of candy rock it was without abbott  it was just costello yeah it it tanked why was it bad because there was no abbott there was no  balance there it was just a fat guy running around you know giant giant woman cheap special effects

[04:44:00]  and eight days had passed so you didn't know where you were when you woke up no no and uh just you  know a bunch of doctors you know staring at me and i was kind of deaf you know i couldn't hear what  they were questioning me because you had an ear infection that turned into spinal meningitis is that  right bacterial meningitis i don't even know what that is but i had fluid on my my brain yeah and was 
[04:44:30]  that like was that as a result of the ear infection yeah the ear infection is not not treating the ear  infection because you're just popping pills instead yeah i was masking the pain it was probably with me  for a while i was pa i was popping illegal uh painkillers yeah that i got from a wrestler that i  know can you say you don't want to tell me which restaurant no i can't you can tell me off the air  though yeah okay all right because i'm curious about that but um it made me think because uh i had an  uncle who has not i don't know i never really knew what happened to him but he drove from kentucky 
[04:45:00]  to jersey right uh to work uh no philly he was in philly to work like an art trade like he makes  like sculptures and he was working a trade show okay and while he's there he drives all the way it's  like probably i don't know 13 hours at least and he's an older guy right and so he kind of he i think  he collapsed like he started he did what i think you were or somebody said where he's making no 
[04:45:30]  sense oh yeah you know what i mean and everybody's going what's going on he kind of collapsed and he  ended up in the hospital and he was there for like a week and a half with them trying to figure out  what went wrong and everything right but he was saying that like being at the hospital or whatever  just really fucks with your brain he was saying that he thought he was in uh nashville oh and so  they'd go what state are you in you go tennessee i'm in nashville you know i know where i am and  they were like no you're in pennsylvania you're in philadelphia and he thought that this was some 
[04:46:00]  kind of thing against him because he wasn't thinking straight uh and so he said he said he  got to the point where and he was like they're keeping me here until i play their game oh he said  he got to the point where they were coming in and saying do you know where you're where you are  and he was saying philadelphia because in his head he goes i know i'm in nashville but i'm  gonna lie and say i'm in philadelphia so these people will let me out oh that's cool so what  was what was his thing what i don't know i i don't know exactly what went wrong i don't know if they 
[04:46:30]  know i think he was it was dehydrating and exhaustion and then and a broken gps and uh and uh and yeah  and just being and then once he was in the hospital just being out for so long yeah i guess like you were  saying like you wake up eight days later and your body's like it's not used to moving yeah your  muscles are you always hear rock guys say you know like they don't know what city they're in  you know when they wake up it's like where am i but it wasn't like that you know i mean it was a  brain injury you know yeah but but was it weird to lose that kind of chunk of time uh that freaks 
[04:47:00]  me out like knowing that the people around you have just lived for eight days yeah it's it's scary to be to  be incapacitated but i you know uh trish was there and my brother tom flew up and trish's mom patty  was there and they so they they saved my life i think getting me the best care but it's scary you  know you're just out they could put their cock in your mouth for eight days you don't know what's going 
[04:47:30]  on you know but as long as you wake up you'll take the cock right i'll take the cock yeah get out of the  hospital but uh yeah they shipped my puppet home george you know very expensive doll he was shipped  home um yeah it was weird and the dreams that that michael jackson drug propofol they say causes  a lot of sexual dreams for people really and uh and and that's why a lot of women think they were  raped by their doctor but i didn't have any any dreams like that i just dreamt that i was shot 
[04:48:00]  yeah i was on a train watching rodeo clowns leap off the train and run into like a stadium people  were cheering and they were being sprayed with hoses very very vivid i i can picture it maybe  you're just more of a bizarre violent man than a sexual man oh you think so maybe that's just yeah  that's the pieces of your brain that propofol opened up all the sort of just weirdness but the  getting shot in the nightclub thing that was like a feature film length length dream you know it all 
[04:48:30]  started with a dog i was in this nightclub and a dog jumped on my lap and i started petting him  and these gangsters that owned the club were angry that they thought i was having too much fun with  the dog and they they wanted to shoot me and they did because they didn't like you playing with the  dog yeah it's not much of a plot is it no that sounds like i wrote this stupid movie that's right  yeah because you wake up from your dream thing and that was brilliant you start writing things down  you go but i shot me because i was playing with a dog but yeah but a week later i still thought i was  shot when i woke up in jersey it was very very weird how long did it take for you to like separate 
[04:49:00]  from that dream world into reality and know that all that stuff was completely made up  did you pretty quick realize that i wasn't shot there's no bullet holes when i saw myself without  my shirt on there was still a lot of things they were giving me needles in my stomach to stop  blood from clotting and there was a they put a nicotine patch on me and this and that so it still  looked like i'm there might be a bullet hole that they're not telling me about it's right 
[04:49:30]  weird did you any did you get paranoid like that like you're like they're not telling me the whole  story well um for about 24 hours i was sure i was dying you know what am i doing here in this hospital  and why are all these people covered with biohazard suits from like a science fiction movie yeah uh even  my brother my brother wore a mask and then my brother my brother tom has got a real exact mind he he read an  art he gave me a um a choice of three articles from some newspaper he had and he read me an entire 
[04:50:00]  article and then and questioned me about it and i thought he i thought he was trying to like uh fight  my boredom but he was really trying to see how fucked up i was he was oh ottawa so what was that article  about i thought he was like oh he was testing short-term memory and yeah but you know that you know  that's just the way my brother is he's got a real exact mind like that and he was probably  wanted to make sure i was okay he wasn't just making conversation yeah yeah but he would that's 
[04:50:30]  something he would do when you're not sick in real life just if you're just coming over he would check  your brain no just read an article that he found interesting or take you on a hike like you just  let's go hiking now i have this day planned you know what does he do my brother he's an environmental  engineer he he checks out businesses to make sure they're not putting too much pollution in the air  of the water is that something he always wanted to do i don't know how he got into that it doesn't  sound very much fun no that is he has he is he an environmentalist like is he an environmental guy 
[04:51:00]  he's like mike stivik on on all in the family he used to pick it and oh he did yeah you know very  pro-black against death penalties very liberal hippie hippie types it's a good person did everybody in  your family just kind of follow whatever they were passionate about no my my whole family is fear  based i'm the only one with any balls to try a job that might be fun or interesting so even though  he's like in his heart he's like a picketing hippie he needs something with some structure  well sure i mean he has children and a wife you know he needs to put food on the table but you know 
[04:51:30]  he's a good guy my brother just different than me he went to cornell for like he went to school  forever he was always in school like my my entire life even when i was growing up he was still in  fucking college is he is he happy yeah he seems happy all right so then you know yeah he's good  thanks for listening to opie and anthony if you missed a minute get it later today at  siriusxm.com slash on demand or stay tuned today's replay starts in minutes here on the opie and anthony
