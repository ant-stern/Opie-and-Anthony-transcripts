<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began by grappling with the fallout from a disastrous Valentine's Day "gay-off" segment.  This segment, sponsored by IHateStevenSinger.com, involved contestants, some with their wives present in the studio (including John and Heather Hyatt), performing increasingly explicit sexual acts for a cash prize. The acts included nudity and simulated oral sex, escalating far beyond the hosts' (Opie and Anthony, along with producer Troy) expectations and causing visible distress to some participants and their spouses. The hosts expressed shock and discomfort at the events, acknowledging the desperation of some contestants and the emotional toll on everyone involved. They vowed never to repeat such a stunt.

The broadcast then veered into a chaotic mix of topics.  E-Rock's YouTube channel showcasing a "batshit crazy" man ("my nigga is Satan") was discussed, followed by prank calls to Mike Francesa.  A Black History Month segment (featuring humorous, possibly apocryphal, African-American inventions, including the horseshoe) was interspersed with "F-U" calls from listeners targeting various individuals and entities, from Jim Norton (whose appearance on Jay Leno was discussed) to Xbox Live.  The conversation jumped to a comparison of subway systems worldwide, criticism of New York's subway, personal hygiene habits, and a lengthy discussion of a disastrous Carnival cruise characterized by overflowing sewage, food shortages, and passengers resorting to using bags for waste.  Numerous listeners shared their own Carnival horror stories.

The next segment started with jokes about a delayed cruise ship arriving in Mobile Bay, followed by discussion of the Christopher Dorner manhunt and a supposed leprechaun sighting in Mobile. This was punctuated by a commercial for "Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour."  The hosts then debated New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed Styrofoam ban, leading into more prank calls to Mike Francesa and a rating of female news anchors' attractiveness. This evolved into a conversation about lesbians and attractiveness, spurred by a listener's call about Cynthia Nixon, followed by commentary on a weight-loss guru's emotional TV appearance and a list of "TV's best nymphos,"  with discussions of "Sex and the City."  The Christopher Dorner case was revisited, and the Harlem Shake viral video trend was discussed, with the hosts brainstorming ideas for their own version, potentially incorporating footage from the previous day's sexually suggestive segments.  A sudden technical issue with a headphone ended this segment.

The subsequent segment focused heavily on planning a Harlem Shake video incorporating edited footage from the previous dayâ€™s sexually explicit activities, aiming for comedic effect and virality while adhering to YouTube's terms of service.  There was discussion about the "gay" nature of the footage and whether it violated existing show rules ("grandfathered in").  A listener's Valentine's Day gift mishap and subsequent girlfriend's reaction were discussed, alongside a Valentine's Day parody song from Scott and Todd.  A bizarre, non-sexual but disgusting audio clip was played.  Several callers commented on the previous day's events, including an incident where a staff member was drenched in water after being called a derogatory name. Kenny was in studio, and G.H. promoted upcoming stand-up shows.  Sam Roberts hosted the "After ONA Live" segment.

Finally, the show revisited the "gay off" involving Sal, Troy, and a male performer, Go-Go, detailing the graphic sexual acts involved, the hosts' subsequent attempts to "wash the gay away" (including detailed descriptions of masturbation to pornography), and their emotional responses.  Manuel from Oakland and Bruce from Louisiana called in, the latter claiming that a picture of Sal inspired him to come out.  The hosts discussed a Dollar Shave Club advertisement (possibly including a planted call), their lack of female guests, and the difficulties in scheduling and managing female guest appearances, including past experiences and management approvals for disrobing on air. Troy was tasked with coordinating future female guests.  The show concluded with the announcement of Jim Norton's advice show the following day and a mention of Opie's video interaction with a homeless man.

[00:03:30]  So extreme.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, I mean, this is insane.  So flatulent.  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real. 
[00:04:00]  That's sex.  Oh!  Turn in with no expectations.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we go.  It'll be an Anthony show.  Another four hours of love.  Are you guys having a good time or what?  Are you guys having a good time or what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it.  I'm up early in the morning, yawning. 
[00:04:30]  But Opie Anthony, yeah, Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man, aunt wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand, he working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  They're horrible people.  They're saying it's old.  Objectible human beings, and I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene, and I'll give it a go.  50 Cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony's show.  Go, go, I know you're feeling the flow.  While Opie's mother-hucking, Jimmy's trying to get blown.  Then we come to play around, and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before. 
[00:05:00]  How important is the board?  Bored you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh, yeah, on the edge of your chair.  Because you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony's show.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now I'm like typing up in this bitch.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:05:30]  Booga, booga.  Booga, booga.  Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  Oh, fuck, man.  Have a good.  Okay.  Good morning, everyone.  Last you heard us, we were in the middle of some really gay shit.  And we've all been deeply affected by this, haven't we? 
[00:06:00]  I've been reading your tweets.  We're having a therapy session in here this morning before the show just talking about  the...  We're talking it through.  We're, uh, yeah.  We're, uh...  Holy shit.  We're dancing yesterday's one and done gay off.  Not even kidding.  That can't ever be done again because I won't show up.  No.  And this isn't a homophobic thing or anything.  No.  This is just...  I can't fucking deal.  Yeah.  Let me set the table.  So, uh...  Why don't you set the table? 
[00:06:30]  Why don't you do the curtains, too?  I think yesterday's show proves that me and you have gotten extremely lazy and that someone  else is controlling this radio show because...  Oh, man.  I woke up one day, I don't know, a mere week or two weeks before yesterday...  Yeah.  ...realizing we're doing a gay off.  I'm like, how the fuck did I ever say yes to this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It kind of took off on its own.  Yeah, it did.  And it was our Valentine's Day, uh, bit.  And, uh, we had IHateStevenSinger.com, you know, come forward with, uh, prize money. 
[00:07:00]  A little prize money.  And then we, uh, had some guys in here with their wives and, uh, and, uh, phew.  We, uh, had them do gay stuff.  I can't believe this.  I don't know.  I still can't believe this.  I can't either.  And, uh, we figured it'd be a little fun, like, kind of in that, kind of in that zone  where we're okay with.  It's that awkwardness and uncomfortability that makes it fun, though. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, you're listening to X-Shock Jocks.  So we're used to seeing some uncomfortable shit.  So we're like, yeah, whatever.  Right.  How bad could this be?  Yeah.  A little tickling, maybe.  Maybe a little lap dancing.  We can all handle that, right?  Because it's so uncomfortable.  There'll be a few jokes in there.  Right.  And then you fast forward and you got guys, like, making out each other in front of their  wives.  And then you got guys oiling up their hands and another man's dick, hoping that he's the  one that gets them hard. 
[00:08:00]  Dude.  And I'm sitting here going, what the fuck is going on?  It was so beyond anything.  By the way, that's my Joe Schmo impression.  I hope people understand that.  Have you picked up on it yet?  Yes.  Because I've used it a lot now.  What is going on here?  Yeah, if you could find the Joe Schmo guy doing it.  But I've been imitating him for a while and a few people have picked up on it.  Anyway, yeah, we fast forward and then I think one guy had a helmet close to his asshole  and I'm like, what the fuck?  It got so far beyond what I thought it was going to be. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  When I read the things that they had to do list, it was things like, oh, the gay guy  is going to tickle the guys.  Oh, look out.  Or even the worst thing was like chocolate syrup poured on his foot and he's got to lick  it off his toes.  Whoa, that's crazy.  Who's going to agree to that?  And then during the show yesterday, I look over and I am seeing what looks exactly like  a gay porno being fucking acted out in our studio. 
[00:09:00]  If we ever released that video, it would probably do very well in the gay community.  In the gay community.  At one point, they had to jerk the guy off and blow a double dill, as Sal would say.  Dude, two guys that are supposedly straight are making out with each other on their knees  in front of a gay gentleman's dick.  Everyone's jerking him off and playing with his balls.  It's like, that isn't like, look at what you're doing. 
[00:09:30]  You're doing something that's kind of, whoa, gay.  Wait, no, you're involved in gay sex.  You're having gay sex.  And like you said, I thought it was going to be some easy stuff.  Like, all right, you're going to have to get naked in a room full of guys.  Look out.  That's kind of crazy, right?  That's insane.  That was like stage one.  Everyone got naked right away.  Even that was weird.  And then we finally had enough, and the one guy's like, no, I want to go further. 
[00:10:00]  I want to continue.  What?  I want to continue.  What?  What?  I'm a host of this show, and I didn't want to continue.  I don't know, man.  Me and I had talked a bunch right before the show trying to figure it out.  Because we've seen so much shit doing this radio show.  We've been at this for about 18 and a half years.  And I don't know what it was.  And we both agreed.  It wasn't like seeing guys naked.  Who gives a fuck?  I don't give a fuck if I see a guy naked. 
[00:10:30]  I really don't.  It's not a, yeah.  I don't care.  I thought the go-go harder guy was hilarious.  I would bring him back on the show.  He was that fun.  He's one funny homo.  Right.  Got to say that.  So I didn't really care.  We've seen some weird shit.  Yeah.  And I just couldn't wrap my head around it.  I think what, I think I finally figured it out.  There was a, what bothered me wasn't like seeing the gay stuff.  Although I didn't see all of it.  I was sitting here in the corner going, have fun, Troy, as you try to figure out what they 
[00:11:00]  could do next.  So I'll be honest.  I didn't really care about that.  I didn't.  It finally hit me.  There was a desperation in the room yesterday.  Yes.  And that's what I went home with.  I was bothered by that.  I was bothered by the fact that I think there were some guys in here that really needed  the money.  Right.  Really.  Well, when you look at two guys that are kneeling down, making out with each other while a gay 
[00:11:30]  dancer rubs his dick on their faces.  Right.  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  And the whole thing is because one of them might get $1,500.  $1,500.  Pre-tax.  Pre-tax.  So that's what, $8, $8, $850 maybe?  Something like that.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I think it comes down to, there was a desperation.  Yeah.  In the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Along with man ass in the air.  Yeah.  I'm rooting it, though.  I mean, fuck.  It's just fucking.  I mean, I could sleep after seeing that shit. 
[00:12:00]  Well, I don't mean seeing it.  I mean, the aroma that was in here, apparently, Ron came in and it was like, it just smells  like man ass in here.  But we've, over the years, have had some really bad smells in here, but we don't realize it  because we're still in the room.  And then it's the people that come into the room that haven't been in the room in a while  that go, what the fuck are you guys doing today?  What happened in here?  Yeah.  I have like post-traumatic stress disorder from yesterday.  It was, as a guy that's been on the radio for a few years and had to sit and describe, there 
[00:12:30]  are plenty of events we've done, and I fancy myself, you know, a professional at describing  what's going on, like a sporting event.  You fancy yourself in visualizing.  Right, right, right.  As they say, painting the picture.  Painting the picture.  In the past, we've had some outrageous things go on, and I kind of like doing it like a sports  announcer kind of a thing.  It's fun that way.  It's our job to describe what the fuck's happening because you only hear our voices.  I was completely out of the mix yesterday.  I couldn't say anything, but I was looking, there were these just gaps of silence from 
[00:13:00]  me, and then I'd look at Opie and just go, I can't even, and I couldn't even like finish  what I was trying to say.  Yeah, I was out of it.  I was very bothered by yesterday.  Out of it, yes!  There were a lot of times where there was a show going on over here, and you two were  just going back and forth just talking about how you can't believe you.  Well, we were talking about the lesbian couch.  And it brings up the lesbian couch, and I go, Ant, that's been gone for about 10 years. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We lost that 10 years ago.  10 years ago.  We really did used to have a lesbian couch.  And this was on regular radio, by the way.  Another bit we're not really allowed to do on satellite radio.  I'm not bitching.  I'm just telling you.  Yeah.  And we would have girls that really wanted to have a lesbian experience, and it got so  crazy, we were doing it pretty much every Friday.  Yeah.  And we had an official lesbian couch.  And when we got fired, we actually, I think we actually dragged it out of the building and  gave it to somebody.  Yeah, I think we did, yeah.  When we gave away our office that day.  Yep. 
[00:14:00]  Someone actually has that to them.  And then we tried to bring it back when we first came to the satellite.  We had a lesbian couch at the old joint before they remodeled.  And then we went bye-bye.  And we have the homosexual studio.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The whole staff, like all of us were just sitting here all afternoon, Sal was all fucked  up.  Troy had to go home early.  Troy left early?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was, Troy was so fucked up after yesterday.  Well, where is he?  He's here already.  And I want to talk to Sal, because I believe Sal was fucked up. 
[00:14:30]  He was fucked up.  Everyone acts like it was the nom.  Like, they all got home from the nom, and.  Yeah, this is something that we're only going to be able to talk about with each other.  We're a band of brothers.  But I'll say it again.  We have seen some extremely weird stuff in the studio.  And I think I finally can nail it down for everybody.  The desperation in the air was what bothered everybody.  The one guy goes, I don't want to stop.  I'm like, what?  Dude, the thing is, we've had severe.  You have to want to stop.  We've had desperation in the studio before with girls that have, you know, done the pick up the money with their twat thing. 
[00:15:00]  And remember, they needed money for Christmas presents, whatever it was.  We've had that desperation.  This was the desperation.  Plus, there was this other underlying thing that men don't do.  That's what it was.  And it was all of it together made this the most uncomfortable thing I've ever been involved with.  But I fully believe now that if you go to prison, you will make out with guys. 
[00:15:30]  You will blow guys.  You will do whatever the fuck.  You'll have gay sex.  And in a way, I don't think you're gay.  I don't know what that is.  That was an experiment.  It was a social experiment yesterday.  Because a lot of people are saying those guys had to be closeted homosexuals.  Best of my knowledge, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I didn't think they were, like, closeted homosexuals.  That was the other part that was so bad.  Yeah.  Was that, like, even with, like, money, honey and stuff like that, there's an element that  eventually most of the girls go, okay, at least in the moment, this is kind of fun and 
[00:16:00]  crazy.  Yeah.  All those guys, every ounce of their being was either, you could see it in their eyes.  They were mentally somewhere else completely.  They did look, it looked like that, their eyes, that thousand mile stare of, like, I'm  just going to a different place.  Right.  I'm going to get through this.  Yeah.  It was psychotic.  And it was against their will.  Yes.  They did not look happy.  And we didn't describe the women well enough.  The wives, they were bothered.  They were trying not to be bothered. 
[00:16:30]  They were trying not to look bothered, but they were bothered.  Even the ones that were laughing?  Yeah.  That was just for, that was for show.  Yeah.  They were absolutely crying on the inside.  Because how can you look at your husband after doing the actions that you just saw him  doing?  How could you look at him like that?  Troy.  Troy.  Yeah, go ahead.  How are you doing, Troy?  Oh, man.  That was, that was rough.  I mean, I've seen, look, I've been through some shit in my life, man.  That was pretty dark.  I guess it came across funny over the air.  That's what I hear.  Because I got a lot of positive feedback from how funny it was. 
[00:17:00]  But in here, I didn't really think it was that funny.  It was just kind of like.  Did you feel like there was a desperation in the air and that's what was bothersome?  Yeah.  You knew it wasn't a bunch of guys like, like, I believe, you know, Troy is absolutely  down for whatever.  And he could go home knowing that, you know, he didn't do anything.  Yeah.  That he didn't want to do.  Right.  But I don't think, I really don't think you're gay, but you did some really gay things yesterday,  if that makes sense.  Yeah.  But, but those guys aren't down for whatever, they're not down for whatever guys. 
[00:17:30]  Right, right, right.  They were guys that, a few of them, it seemed like wanted, needed or wanted the money badly.  Needed the money.  Troy had fun with it, though.  Right.  That's the difference.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Heather Hyatt and the guy, I think his name is Dave.  Dave.  Well, they didn't care.  Well, they, you know, they're doing their own podcast.  She's a stand-up comic.  Like, they were looking for a little attention for their stuff.  So, I, I, him, I didn't, I wasn't bothered by either, because I knew he was just trying  to get some of his plugs in.  Yeah, I kind of looked at it like, they, all the guys were super fans, and they wanted 
[00:18:00]  to just be here in your guys' presence.  Oof.  And they didn't care what they had to do to get to that point, and they had just convinced  their girls that.  They should have just waited for the next car crash comedy.  It was.  Yeah.  Right, yeah.  Yeah, we'll, we'll bring that one back eventually.  Tell some jokes.  With clothes on.  Yes.  And you could always tell if, uh, if the women are into the show or not, and I would, one,  definitely Heather Hyatt, and maybe one other, maybe two of the wives had pretty much 
[00:18:30]  no idea what we were about.  Oh, man.  No.  Lon.  Which makes it worse.  Very into the show.  Lon is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She emailed me afterwards.  She had a great time.  Oh, good.  Yeah, no, she did.  She really had a very good time.  Yeah, she did.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  What was the worst thing you saw yesterday, Troy?  Just towards the end where we're trying to, like, up the any as high as we could go.  You know what I mean?  And we're like, look, the next level after this is getting, someone's going to get fucked  in their ass or have to take a pot shot.  We said before the show.  If there wasn't a rule, if management didn't have the no penetration or something. 
[00:19:00]  If we were at the old studio.  Absolutely would have been oral sex going on and then ass fucking would have been going  on for $1,500.  Yes.  So at that point, these guys are prostitutes.  Right.  They're pipping themselves out for a few bucks.  The worst thing that I saw was right before the guy put the oil on his ass and tried to  rub it on the dick.  Before it was, that wasn't the worst thing.  Right.  It was right before that when that guy started his freestyle round.  Yeah.  Because Gogo was sitting in the chair with his legs spread, obviously completely nude. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  And the guy went over to him and with one hand, it was pulling on his dick.  He was making direct eye contact with him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was creepy.  But what really bugged me was what he did with his left hand.  He got on top of Gogo and scooped under his ass cheek.  So he was, like, holding him up and, like, manhandling him while he was tugging his dick  and making eye contact.  Like, it was what happens in a gay man's bedroom.  It was gay sex. 
[00:20:00]  That was bad.  And what awful hand jobs.  The worst.  That's the type of thing, and that's what the prison aspect comes into play.  Because, you know, if a guy, like, they were doing it for $1,500.  This is the same thing a guy has to do for his dinner or for not getting shanked.  Like, in prison.  So you get that same lack of enthusiasm.  It's not this loving gay scene in prison.  There's a guy just half-assed, like, jerking a guy off. 
[00:20:30]  That's what was so disturbing about it.  There was no real want to do this.  I think we owe Gogo Harder a good hand job.  He was a trooper.  He was a cool guy.  I talked to him after the show, and he was like, oh, is everything okay?  I was like, yeah, you were great, man.  There was an overwhelming.  I appreciate Fonny, man.  He was funny.  He's a funny guy.  On Twitter, overwhelmingly, like, amount of praise for him.  Like, everyone loved him.  Well, he's gay, and he was funny, and he wasn't here. 
[00:21:00]  Like, he wasn't doing anything that he doesn't want to do.  He walks in and goes, so should I just, like, get naked now?  Yeah.  Well, that was the difference.  He wasn't doing anything that he didn't want to do.  Yeah.  All the other guys were.  Do you think that when you see a guy, like, with a goatee and a shaved head, and he's  just making out with another fucking flabby guy, and it's just, it was, that part was so  disturbing.  You heard Sal.  It's against their natural instincts.  Sal started rubbing himself down with Clorox wipes, saying that he felt a man's goatee in 
[00:21:30]  his asshole.  Sal, how are you feeling today?  And I, you know, I'll break down some walls.  I really believe you were disturbed yesterday when we were talking this morning.  The bronzer came nicely on your face.  It's not streaky on your face.  You look like you have a slight tan.  You're back from Florida.  It's so blotchy on his arms.  My legs, it's just completely stained.  Yeah, yeah.  It just looks like wood stain. 
[00:22:00]  Someone brushed it on your legs.  So what's your thoughts from yesterday?  I was, by the way, I still think you're gay, but I think yesterday was just too much  for you.  Yeah, yes.  Yesterday, I was so, so out of it and so disturbed yesterday when I got there.  I was like, I was emotionally drained.  It was just awful.  It was really fun.  Did your mom listen to the show?  I told her not to listen yesterday.  Oh, she does.  Yeah, I was like, just lots of gay shit went on, don't listen.  And she's like, okay.  Do you know what I went home and slept until 6 p.m.? 
[00:22:30]  I was exhausted because, like, I was emotionally exhausted for seeing something that is so,  like, just reprehensible.  And it's not the idea of the gay, gayness that it was.  It was that there were heterosexual guys that have a natural aversion to gay sex.  And I don't mean hearing about it or knowing other guys do it, but being involved in it.  Having it.  As a heterosexual male, you have an aversion to participating in gay sex. 
[00:23:00]  It's what every heterosexual man fears about prison and things like that.  Right.  And there they were, placed in a situation where they had to engage in it, and it permeated  the room in this uncomfortable feeling that everybody felt.  Right.  And when I left this studio, not quickly enough, because I wanted out of here at 10, and we  stayed on until almost 11, I got in the truck, and I'm driving home, and I'm just like, 
[00:23:30]  I felt filthy.  Yeah.  Filthy.  Yeah.  Well, that leads me to the next thing, because you got out of here.  Right after the show.  Oh, thank God, because from what I heard.  So then I stayed a little later than that, and I was trying to film some dumb, dopey video  kind of around the corner here.  The guy wasn't naked or anything.  It was something completely different.  And all of a sudden, Sal brought one of the contestants over. 
[00:24:00]  He wanted to say goodbye.  Uh-huh.  I'm like, yeah, what's up?  And I see him walking toward me, and his wife, I don't want to mention which guy.  You probably can figure it out on your own.  And his wife is hysterically crying.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Hysterically crying.  And I'm like, whoa, what's going on?  And she goes-  Like, sobbing?  Uncontrollably crying.  Holy shit.  He's holding her tight.  Like, it's going to be okay.  Like, they had some incredible tragedy in their lives, which I guess they did, obviously. 
[00:24:30]  Worse than most.  I go, what's going on?  And what the-  She goes, he told me to not stop him no matter what.  And she wanted to at some point, I gather.  Yeah, she wanted him out of the scene way earlier than he was.  And she wanted to, but then she had to watch him doing horrific things with another man.  They had a conversation before the bit where he said to her, no matter what, do not tap out.  I want and need to win this thing. 
[00:25:00]  That's where, and that's what I felt in the air.  Oh, that desperation.  When I finally figured out in my own stupid brain that there was a weird desperation attached to what we were seeing yesterday.  And I can't speak for the guy.  If he wants to talk on the show about it, that's fine.  But it seems to me that they really, really needed the money.  Badly.  There's got to be some shit you could sell on eBay or something.  There's got to be an alternative.  Right?  So I, you know, I mean, I'm not an asshole the entire day. 
[00:25:30]  Maybe a couple hours on the radio every day.  But I don't live my life like that.  I think a lot of people start to figure that out.  So I'm like, I go into, let's try to fix this mode.  I'm like, look, man, you know, it was all just fun.  It's for the radio.  I'm playing that shit.  Meanwhile, you probably looked like your eyes looked like, oh, my God, no, this wasn't fun.  I'm like, don't worry about it.  It was all just for fun.  There was nothing crazy in there.  It's just for the radio.  We're just having a good time.  You know, just trying to, like, soften it up a little bit. 
[00:26:00]  But in my head, I have all the visions, visuals of this guy fucking jerking off this guy.  That was the worst.  And making out with the other guy.  Jimmy spoke to them and Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy spoke to them as well.  Jimmy did a good job with helping.  Well, he didn't do a good job because she was still crying when she got to me because I know Jimmy left before I did.  They're in a lot of trouble.  Do you know how long it took Jess to get over the idea that Bob Kelly had kissed me as a goof?  Oh, my God.  And she didn't see it. 
[00:26:30]  And it was nothing.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  And that was just...  She had to sit there.  Yeah.  Watch her husband jerk off a homosexual man with lotion making out with another...  With multiple men.  Men.  Nude.  Multiple nude the whole time.  Multiple nude men.  Yeah, multiple.  Nude men.  It has to destroy a woman to see that. 
[00:27:00]  Wasn't there a point Troy's asshole was on the guy's nose with his fucking balls on his eyes?  Yes, yes.  His nose was absolutely up Troy's asshole.  All this shit was going on as I'm trying to calm her down.  And then they walked off.  They pretty much limped away.  Yeah.  It's not good.  And then I'm like, oh, my God.  Those guys really needed the money.  That's the...  Yeah, the desperation part.  And that's what I took home, man.  I was really depressed.  When they were kneeling down, fucking making out with each other as a gay man is smacking 
[00:27:30]  their face and the top of their heads with his dick.  Yeah.  I was just looking over going, that's it.  I can't...  I fucking can't even describe this.  Let me...  I need to go...  And then I got down to the truck outside.  Yeah.  And Kenny pulled my truck up and he gets out and I go, all right, take it easy.  Kenny goes, now go home and jerk off.  But he's the...  As funny as that is, I got to bring into something. 
[00:28:00]  Kenny will...  And Sam knows this as well.  Kenny will come up with one good line and then he feeds it to everybody.  Everyone.  Because guess what?  He said that to you?  It was the exact same line.  So he couldn't wait to tell me that as I opened my door.  Hey, if it works.  Keep using it.  Keep using it.  But I think we're just having a conversation.  But in his head, he has a couple programmed lines that he wants to fucking tell everybody.  Jess and me get the same text from him.  Yeah.  It's the same joke.  We live in the same house.  Right.  At the same time.  Hey, look. 
[00:28:30]  I got a text from Kenny.  Oh, what does it say?  Yeah.  We got Heather Height.  She's one of the wives of one of the guys from yesterday.  Dave's wife there.  Heather, what's up?  Hey.  You were saying before about Dave and I, we do the podcast and stuff, so we're probably  all right.  We just want to get our plugs in.  Yeah.  And we thought that too.  And then last night we were late in bed, going to sleep, and I was like, I kind of feel  a little damaged.  Oh, wow.  If Heather's damaged.  Yeah, because Heather, I mean, we know a little bit about you over the years, and you guys 
[00:29:00]  are down for some whatever stuff, right?  Yeah, usually.  Yeah.  But you were even damaged.  Yeah, I think the problem is, like Anne was saying, like, with two heterosexual guys  that are just so adverse to it, or so uncomfortable, it was like a relief when Go-Go got there.  Right.  You know?  It was a relief when the gay guy got here.  Thank God there's a gay guy here for this gay stuff.  Because when Sal was doing stuff, it was like watching two people rape each other. 
[00:29:30]  Like, they're just both getting raped.  Nobody wants to be raped, but they're just still doing it.  Just two people getting raped with each other.  Oh, my God.  It absolutely, there's an aversion to heterosexual men having to engage in gay sex.  Sorry, gay people.  That's just the way it is.  When you're watching a movie where there's two gay guys, and I'm not talking porno or anything, 
[00:30:00]  just, you know, your mainstream movies, like that Brokeback Mountain.  And when there's this kissing going on, and hugging and kissing, there's something disturbing  to heterosexual men about that.  You could call it homophobic, but it's not homophobia.  You could be totally open to guys doing whatever they want to do if they're gay.  But as a heterosexual man, you are going to look at that, and there's going to be some 
[00:30:30]  natural kind of pullback.  You're going to go like, ah, recoil.  Especially when you realize it's your mouth doing it.  Right.  Now take that feeling that you get just looking at it, and now make you gotta do it.  You're sitting there kissing another man.  Heather, what was the worst part for you that Dave did?  The worst part was the double toe suck, kiss up the thighs thing.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that one. 
[00:31:00]  I love when people have to describe some of this scene from yesterday.  It's just terrible.  And fucking Troy.  Troy has an imagination.  He's like, okay, how about, all right, the double dill.  They gotta give the double dill head while they caress each other's backs and jerk the  guy off.  How about we try that one?  Troy was throwing out suggestions.  Oh, yeah, left and right.  He's crazy, like a director.  As they were kneeling in front of the guy, Troy was the one who said, all right, one of  you grab his balls, and the other one pull the shaft. 
[00:31:30]  And so they're sitting there.  One guy has his hand on the balls.  The other guy has his hand on the dick.  And they're kneeling.  And they're all naked, and the two heterosexuals are kissing each other while they're playing  with the other guy's dick.  Holy shit.  That's just crazy.  I figured we just gotta make sure we elevate this as high as we can go.  Troy's a great homosexual puppet master.  Oh, yeah.  That's what happened to Troy.  While he was in the room, it was like, we're all here in this environment.  And then when he left the room, part of it was like, what the fuck just happened? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I was involved in that.  You know what it was, too?  It was the sort of, relatively speaking, gradual buildup to the real horrific stuff.  It went quickly.  But to just have Sal tickling the guys, that's how it starts.  It's a goof.  And it was a goof.  It was like, just for them to take their shirt off, it was like, oh, boy, this is crazy.  And then it ends up pretty much just gay sex with nude men.  But it's in this room where it started that way and gradually built up. 
[00:32:30]  The second you walk out of that door, you're out of this microcosm where it was something almost okay because it's a radiant thing.  But once you left, you have to leave with all that baggage now.  And I have never listened to Al Q, but I pretty much can guarantee.  Yeah.  You already know what I'm going to say.  That we went way gayer than they ever have. 
[00:33:00]  Way.  I can guarantee that without even ever hearing Al Q and what they do.  Mark Zito wanted to see a little bit of the video.  Did he?  And I was like, okay.  And I just kind of flipped the camera around and showed him what happened.  And as I was watching it and showing it to him, it was like, oh, my God.  Like, this happened.  It's not like a made-up thing.  Like, this happened.  I'm watching.  Yeah.  It shows like that that I don't want to see Ron Bennington in the hall. 
[00:33:30]  You kind of turn around and take the other hallway to the elevator.  Yeah, but Fez came off to me afterwards.  He was pretty much cool with the whole thing.  He said to me.  He was reciting some of the lines he heard that he thought was funny.  Yeah.  He said the gays won.  Yes.  And I said, I mean, we weren't really competing with gays.  Right.  There was one gay guy in the room for 45 minutes of the whole thing.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  I'm not even sure if he technically won.  Yeah.  Heather, anything else?  I just wanted to mention the thing with Troy was that, like, I was rooting for him. 
[00:34:00]  Like, he'd come up with something.  I'd be like, yeah, yeah, good.  That's good.  And then I'd be like, oh, whoa, wait, wait.  They got to do that now, though.  Hold on.  I think your husband's on the line as well.  Oh.  I guess you guys don't live with each other anymore.  You threw me out.  I'm living on a street now.  Hey, Dave, you officially won the gay off.  Yes.  I'm holding my head high today. 
[00:34:30]  We should have had a trophy made.  We should have had a trophy.  Well.  Like, penis.  Well, that would have ended up.  We'd have the double dung.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That double dunger would have been great.  So what's going on with you today, Dave?  Um, I'm kind of coping with the post-traumatic stress, but we laughed about it for hours afterwards  with Hilarious.  Oh, you better laugh.  I don't know.  Heather's a little bothered.  Heather's a little bothered today.  Yeah.  If Steven Singer wants to gold dip that double dung, that'd be cool. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, well, that'd be a pleasure to have that on the mantle.  I love that we held up Steven Singer for, what, $1,200?  We had to.  We absolutely held him up.  He couldn't say no.  No, no.  But if he's listening, we were in a desperate spot.  That's why we did it on the air, by the way.  Yeah, we'll make it up to you somehow, but we were in a very desperate spot.  Gave him a friggin' live commercial right there when we were trying to get money out of him.  Yep, yep.  I kept offering the other guy.  I kept telling him, look, it's just down to you and me. 
[00:35:30]  Let's tap out.  We'll split first and second prize.  Let's end it.  And he didn't want to end it.  No, he, I think he's on the line.  We'll talk to him in a second here.  Oh, boy.  If he's listening, stay there.  We'll get to you.  Yeah, he didn't want to tap out.  And he was the one that had the wife after the show bawling, hysterically.  Oh, you guys saw her crying, too?  Yeah.  What was she saying to you guys?  She didn't say much of anything until she was speaking to all three of us and she had calmed down.  I said, are you all right?  And then she slowly just broke down again and started crying. 
[00:36:00]  Holy shit.  And you heard what she said.  She said, I was told not to tap out no matter what.  Yeah, because the wives could have tapped out for their guys.  Yeah, I was going to tap out for Dave.  No, no, Heather's a sadistic bitch.  She was not going to tap out for me for nothing.  So, Dave, what was the worst part for you?  Worst part was the kissing.  Ugh.  Fucking worst. 
[00:36:30]  There's a lot of it, too.  Oh, there was a lot of that.  Ugh.  That was harder.  That is worse than jerking off the guy.  How weird is that?  When Go-Go went in and started kissing him on the neck, I think that was when it was, like,  really bad for me.  Yeah, it started getting real.  You know what?  That was.  That was, like, there was a moment where it became, like, oh, my God, this is actually  happening.  When Go-Go was naked and he was, like, who are the girls on the couch?  And they were, like, oh, those are our wives.  And Go-Go goes, oh, well, in that case. 
[00:37:00]  And he just started passionately making out with them.  And I was, like, oh, my God, shit just got really real in here.  This is how, like, those hazings go, I bet, where you end up in jail because someone died  or someone got fucking raped or something.  As it's happening, it's like, hey, this is whatever it is.  And then someone must look over and go, wow, this is really getting a little much.  It's, like, very bad things when they kill this tripper.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're just sitting in prison going, what happened? 
[00:37:30]  What the fuck happened?  We were, what?  Just terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Anything else, Dave or Heather?  No, I just want to thank Stephen Singer for my blood money.  It will be spent in good health on ADP and other things.  I hope you have fun with that.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Stephen Singer.  All right.  You know what one of the worst parts was? 
[00:38:00]  Yes, Travis.  This was a Wednesday show.  Like, we couldn't just, like.  We had to come back.  Yeah, we couldn't take the three-day weekend.  Back to the scene of the crime.  Like when they had to go back to the church in Platoon.  This is therapy, though.  I like this.  There's still two more days of work.  This is like being in a meeting.  Let's get it out.  Support.  Iraq.  Iraq comment.  Why haven't you talked yet?  He's jerking off.  It really got bad for me.  I mean, besides everything they were doing. 
[00:38:30]  But when he first came in.  And he's nuzzling.  Yeah, Go-Go came in.  He's nuzzling the guys' necks.  They're all just standing there.  But he gets to the last dude.  He's holding the one guy's hand and rubbing the wedding ring while he's fondling the guy's genitals.  And that's when I'm like, this is not going well.  Jesus.  He's rubbing his dick in a wedding ring at the same time.  Oh, God.  So fucking weird yesterday.  It's basically, I mean, it's coming on your vows.  You know what I mean? 
[00:39:00]  It's like.  Oh, God.  I would have to sit down and think about it for an hour or so.  I'm trying to think if that was the craziest, weirdest show we've ever done.  Yes.  Yeah, but then when you start writing shit out, you go, wait a minute.  Then there was the time.  No, that was the biggest aversion I've ever had to anything that was going on in the studio.  It was probably weirdest show ever.  If you ever needed a conclusion to your book, I think yesterday's show.  Oh, God.  That's when we decided to quit radio.  That's it.  That's it.  We all went our own way.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  It was never the same after that day.  You really think those guys would have taken a dick in their ass for the contest?  Oh, yeah.  Someone would have taken a dick in their ass.  They absolutely would have been oral.  Yeah.  They would have gone down on each other.  You know what?  It just was terrible.  The dude who told his wife not to tab out?  Yeah.  I think he would have taken a dick in their ass.  If need be.  If need be.  Well, he's on the line.  Let's talk to him.  Hey, buddy.  Do you want your name out there?  I'll just say John. 
[00:40:00]  I'm fine with that.  All right, John.  What's up, buddy?  So you and your wife came up to me after the show, and she was hysterical.  Yeah.  So walk us through.  What was going on?  She was upset that, you know, I wouldn't let her tap out.  She felt like she was powerless, and she was also upset, like, how can they do that on  the radio?  And that was.  She should be management.  Go.  So it was a very quiet, you know, two to three hour ride home. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, was it?  What was said?  Not much.  She wouldn't tell me what she was thinking at all.  She just kept saying, I want to focus on driving.  I want to focus on driving.  Oh, boy.  And, yeah, I mean, we had dinner together.  Did you have the kielbasa?  No.  I can absolutely say that I would not have taken a dick.  I would not have blown a dick.  Oh.  Yeah, but you probably would have said yesterday that you wouldn't have, like, oiled up your 
[00:41:00]  asshole and rubbed it on a dick.  Like, weird stuff was going on yesterday, dude.  I don't blame you.  Probably.  You know, on Tuesday, you probably would have said, I'm never going to jerk off a man while  I'm kissing another man.  You know, so you can't say.  There's a weird place in here.  Yeah, so she was hysterical because she couldn't tap out for you.  And, I mean, what's the deal?  Is there a money issue in your family?  Yeah.  Well, we have our daughter, 13 months old, and she takes a lot of money. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, I have multiple sclerosis, so I've run up a fair amount of medical bills myself.  Oh, Jesus.  You don't look like that.  Yeah.  It's, I've had it for.  Oh, Jesus.  I was actually diagnosed about three months after we got married in 2008.  Oh, my goodness.  So, you need the money for what?  Well, a lot of stuff.  You know, we're just in credit card debt.  And I honestly viewed yesterday's show as a job, and I would have done whatever was needed 
[00:42:00]  to get the money for the sake of a job.  Uh-huh.  You know, I kind of.  Well, what else would you have done if we kept the contest going?  To be honest, I almost tapped out when we were going to lick armpits.  Right.  Oh, that was nothing.  That was easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we look back at it.  Looking back.  Right.  It was using your mouth. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And, like, your tongue, specifically.  And the only other thing throughout the entire show that, like, you had to use your tongue,  which, you know, in my mind, I thought of, like, eating something, was when I had to lick  his leg before the kiss.  Because none of the kisses were tongue kisses.  You know, nothing like that.  Putting a double dong with a condom in your mouth, that's nothing.  That's just in your mouth.  His toes in your mouth, you're not even licking the toes.  You're just kind of putting them in your mouth.  So, that was the whole thing was just, I, it was like an oral thing. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, like, him touching me with his dick and everything, it was just skin.  And that's what I just kept telling myself, is it's nothing.  It's just skin.  Yeah.  Kind of.  So, how's the wife doing?  She's asleep right now.  I'm at work.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, so, how did you guys end it last night?  She went up to bed. 
[00:43:30]  I actually, I had to take my medicine for MS, which I take once a week.  So, I took that, and it knocked me out.  So, that was it.  It was a very cold evening, as far as not much talking.  Oh, yeah.  I was just about to ask, without getting too personal, how are things with him and his wife physically?  Yeah.  Any spooning last night?  Was there any spooning in bed?  No.  No, to be honest, usually any time I do my medicine, it's just right to bed. 
[00:44:00]  Are you guys going to be all right?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I don't see a terrible thing happening.  I may have to talk to her a lot, but she's good at hiding her emotions for the most part,  except when she breaks out into tears.  Which we all saw yesterday.  That shit got real, man.  Like, I was driving around the corner from my house, she was in the passenger seat, 
[00:44:30]  and I took a turn a little too quick in the rain, and my car spun, and she was in that same panic,  because she felt helpless.  That's the whole thing, is she breaks down when she feels helpless.  Well, that was pretty helpless there yesterday.  I was almost breaking down and crying yesterday's show, once I left.  Well, how are you guys going to get money for your bills and everything else you're dealing with?  Just keep working. 
[00:45:00]  That's all we can do.  And we'll have the event next year, honestly.  No, no, no.  Jesus.  No, no, no.  That is it.  Yeah, that's it for that.  Holy fuckaroni.  We officially say goodbye to the gay.  That's it.  The gay is done on this show.  Yes.  Anyone that brings it up, anyone that brings up another event or something, it ain't going to happen.  We went out with a bang.  Certainly did.  Almost.  Almost is right.  Almost.  But, John, you just didn't want to tap out, and at the end there, you're like, no, man, I want to keep going. 
[00:45:30]  I was in it for the money.  But we ran out of stuff to do.  It really came down to, hey, we did every single thing but fucking, but fucking.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I, like, I would have taken a dildo or something.  What, in your butt?  In your ass?  Yeah, why not?  Sure.  But, I, I was in it for the money.  I wanted the money because it would greatly help us. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I assume it's going to be a weird Valentine's Day for you guys.  Uh, yeah.  The weirder thing was her parents called on Skype last night.  From where?  Japan?  Yeah, yeah.  Her whole family's in Japan.  You know.  And?  They got SiriusXM online.  Oh, boy.  I, I, I sit there, but she speaks Japanese and I don't.  Uh-oh.  So, they were talking nonstop, and, you know, she wouldn't tell me what they were talking about. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  Did you hear, oh, don't you want to come into a homo?  Jerky-dicky.  Bro-job.  Yeah.  And then after...  Oil bottle.  Nose in ass whore.  Yeah, but then...  He kept saying.  Yeah.  After the Skype, her grandfather called about a half hour later. 
[00:47:00]  And they talked for another hour.  And she still wouldn't tell me what it was.  She just said, oh, he just wanted to talk.  Very dishonorable.  Fucking on Skype, he committed harry-carry.  He fucking took a samurai sword and disemboweled himself on Skype.  Just planning her return trip.  Anything else, John?  He a very nice man. 
[00:47:30]  He can blowjobs on Park Avenue.  At the end of the day, I view it like being in the military and having to shoot someone  and not being interested in killing someone.  Yeah, there you go.  It's just like it.  For your job.  Just like it.  American hero.  I had to for the job.  All right, buddy.  Well, thanks for participating.  I'm sorry your wife cried, certainly.  Yes.  Konnichiwa.  That wasn't our goal yesterday.  Our goal was to kind of keep it fun, and it got, shit got real in here. 
[00:48:00]  And then it got really real after the show when I realized she was really damaged by the whole thing.  Well, thank you for the money.  We do appreciate that.  Oh, the money.  Yeah.  The evil, evil money.  Yep.  All right, man.  All right.  Godspeed there, Chen.  All right.  There goes John.  Yesterday, afterward, he tried to give me a vial of his empty medicine jar. 
[00:48:30]  I'm not quite sure what that was about.  Why?  I have no idea.  He was probably trying to, like, show that he didn't.  Hey, look, I need money.  I didn't know he was sick.  I have no idea.  He didn't look sick at all.  He's like, I want you to have this.  And I was like, I don't know what I'm going to do with that.  You to have.  Did you take it?  I just checked Twitter.  One guy goes, at first I was annoyed that we weren't picked for the gay off.  However, very relieved that we were.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's funny.  It's like you dodged a bullet there, isn't it?  And then Vince A on Twitter, I could see the O&A movie opening with yesterday's show with a voiceover. 
[00:49:00]  How did it all get to here?  It was fucking brutal.  You got to give it to all those girls were cute.  I mean, it was nice to have a couple of cute girls in the room.  That helped out a little bit.  Yeah, in that situation, did it help at all?  Yeah, how much did it help?  Yeah, they were cute to you because they were horrified.  It's like a tsunami coming in and going, thank God we have the bucket to bail the house out of.  Right.  That's great that that helped. 
[00:49:30]  Anything else?  Exhausted.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was...  I've never been more affectionate with Justin last night trying to cleanse myself.  Yeah, was that it?  We had to be physically intimate.  You had to.  Had to.  Yeah.  She texted me asking how the gay off went in the afternoon.  Mm-hmm.  And I knew that...  This is how I know that people have a lot to deal with now.  Because she wrote...  I said, hey, you know, long day.  And she was like, oh, I bet it was a long day. 
[00:50:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  And then I said, it got so weird.  And then she wrote back, oh, I believe it.  You're playing with fire.  What happened?  Who did you kiss?  Oh, oh, Jesus.  How did everyone deal with it?  Opie, what did you do when you got home, like, to deal with it?  I was just mad.  You were mad?  Because I couldn't figure it out.  Yeah, yeah.  So you were angry.  I was just mad.  Troy?  But then, you know, because I left... 
[00:50:30]  Well, and seeing the wife cry, that shit gets me.  Yeah, you saw that.  Yeah, that shit, believe it or not, you know, gets me.  And, yeah, I was like, fuck, the guy was in here for...  It wasn't for a fun radio bit.  He was in here because they're desperate for money.  I'm glad I ran the fuck out of here, man.  Dude, if you saw this...  Oh, I'm glad I did.  I know you're a cold-hearted son of a bitch.  Oh, a prick.  But I'll tell you, man, I think that one would have got to you.  Oh, that would have been bad.  It was brutal.  He was holding on to her tight because she was...  It looked like...  Because I have, unfortunately, seen a couple of these over the years. 
[00:51:00]  It looked like she was ready to have a complete and utter nervous breakdown.  Wow.  And I'm like, holy fuck, calm her down, calm her down.  It was just fun.  It was for the radio.  Don't worry.  I go, he didn't really do anything that crazy.  And like I said, I had the pictures in my head of this guy fucking jerking off the gay performer.  That ham-handed, half-assed handjob.  Yeah.  Oh, that just was fucking...  It's like, he's just rubbing the head of the guy's dick between his thumb and forefinger.  Right.  Waka, waka, waka, waka. 
[00:51:30]  And then I just finally tweeted.  I said, hey, sorry, I've been in hibernation all day.  And then, of course, the dumb fucking Twitter haters.  Oh, you were in hibernation because you're embarrassed what the Philly crew would think.  I read every tweet in that voice now, by the way.  I'm like, and I would love to write these guys back, but at this point, it's just nonsense.  The Philly crew, which I don't really say as much anymore, wouldn't give a fuck.  What did you do, Troy? 
[00:52:00]  I went home and jerked off to porno.  Did you?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  Oh, it's funny.  Yeah.  Straight porno.  A little straight porno.  What about Sal?  Sal, how did you handle the aftermath?  I had a pretty depressing day.  I went home, I took a shower.  Did you curl up in the fetal position by the drain, crying, like Ace Ventura?  The water pouring off me was just brown.  It was awful.  You were bummed you weren't the one sitting in the lounge chair?  You brought that home with you, bummed out? 
[00:52:30]  I did.  It was a great opportunity.  All that attention go-go.  Yeah.  I did a lot of drinking, actually, by myself.  Drinking?  Yeah.  I was really depressed.  I washed my hands probably, no joke, probably about 15 times.  Well, that shame will never wash you.  Jerk off.  That's a problem.  And I did jerk off later on in the evening.  Did you?  Just to get it out.  Not to anything, any memory.  Well, of course.  What did you jerk off to?  Go.  Tell me right now.  I forgot.  I think it was...  Oh, boy.  I forgot. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, God.  I forgot.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Everybody knows what that means.  He was turned on by what was happening yesterday and had to fucking get a bad show.  I think it just may have added to the confusion that he's already got going on.  Like I said yesterday, don't wait 10 years like Fez did.  Go, go harder.  Don't wait fucking 10 years.  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you what he jerked off to in three words.  The first two are go and go.  Ah, there it is.  There it is.  Just said the same fucking joke twice.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  Travis, where's my mic?  It's radio.  Like I said, I slept till 6 p.m. 
[00:53:30]  I was like, you know how depressed people sleep all the time?  That's like, I had to just sleep for hours on end.  And when I woke up, I decided I was going to crack open a bottle of wine and then I just  perused like hate websites, like nigger mania and fucking all of the hate websites.  And I started feeling better.  I wandered around the neighborhood and filmed my latest crazy guy.  Did you?  Yeah.  You dove right back into it. 
[00:54:00]  Right, I did.  I wandered around and I found a guy I've wanted to film for a while.  And the title of the video is My Nigga is Satan.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  My Nigga is Satan.  This guy is explaining why that word is Satan.  Satan himself.  Yes.  Well, judging by the new video from the Atlanta security guard, that word gets used a lot.  Really?  Yeah, it's a new one.  Is it a good video to play?  Well, toward the end, a woman gets in his face and starts repeating things over and 
[00:54:30]  over again.  You never see that in those videos.  Oh, boy.  What about E-Rock?  What did you do?  I left here and had to go to my brother's house.  And when I got over there, he's just shaking his head looking at me because everyone at  work hurt.  And he didn't even hear the show.  That's how he reacts to E-Rock.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, boy.  That is true.  Oh!  He's just like, what are you doing?  Like I said, the only part that sticks with me is the fact that that couple was desperate 
[00:55:00]  for money.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, fuck, dude.  It wasn't supposed to get to that point.  It was supposed to be ridiculously silly and stupid.  That's how things snowball out of control.  Right.  That's how parties end up in, like, rape charges.  That's how hazings end up in deaths.  That's how football camp ends up with some of the junior varsity team with pine cones  up their assholes.  Next thing you know, you're rolling up a stripper in a rug and throwing her in a dumpster and 
[00:55:30]  hoping.  Driving to a quarry and hoping.  Oh, my God.  That's just terrible.  Mm-hmm.  You want to hear, uh, my nigga is Satan?  Yeah.  Not the whole thing, because there's some visuals, but the guy loves using his hands.  Let me tell you what's going on.  This is the guy, okay?  Keith Richards.  He's not from 21 North.  He's from 21 South.  Right.  He doesn't like people, especially, you know, people who aren't him, like German. 
[00:56:00]  So he's like, my nigga.  I'm always trying to keep this guy, you know, from 1941, et cetera, you know, under there.  And everything that everybody else does.  Holy shit.  Like, yo, my nigga, let me, let me get you some pizza, you know, let me help you to relax.  Let me get you a drink.  You know, let me give you some money.  Because he's amazing. 
[00:56:30]  He's an amazing guy.  And that's the way it is, guy.  That's the way it really is.  What's he doing with his hands?  My nigga is Satan.  That's who I'm talking to.  He's a white guy, too.  And, you know, like, it's an old name.  It should never be said twice at the dinner table or something, unless you really have to.  This guy's batshit crazy.  Same way you wouldn't say the word cake three times.  Those pacifiers are not sure.  Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, oh, gotcha, gotcha.  They didn't just lynch Negroes.  They lynch Jews, too.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  And they were very Italian.  You know, Italian.  Now, where's your lens, guys?  Whoa, whoa.  Where's your lens, guys?  Get the picture of that tree for one little second and then come back to me.  Dogs do this.  They let it go, they leave it alone, and they walk away when they're done. 
[00:57:30]  People don't do that.  They have to go through the hole, pull the chain routine.  That's why.  Now I understand.  There you go.  Holy shit.  That guy's crazy.  Look at him, he's hiding behind the bush.  That's a cut.  That's going to be a cut, Derek.  You think?  He's directing.  He's got a funny deal.  He's got a big cut.  He's got a big cut.  You know why you don't smoke?  You know how I know? 
[00:58:00]  Why?  You have teeth.  All right, brother.  What do you do?  What do you do?  All right.  Later.  Wow.  That guy is out there.  I've seen him a bunch in the neighborhood.  Some days he's batshit.  That's not him being batshit crazy.  I knew he was calm enough where I could finally approach him.  I saw him once taking a fucking chair and just slamming it into one of the bank windows 
[00:58:30]  over and over again, trying to shatter the fucking window.  What the fuck?  I love this guy.  Is he just like a...  And as I'm walking by him, I couldn't get in on film, but he was saying my nigga to everyone  that passed.  I'm like, it's just a matter of time before he gets a beat down.  And then an old stupid Upper West Side broad walks by me.  I'm laughing because I'm like, I love this shit.  I love seeing this shit.  She's like, someone has to remove him from the neighborhood.  And I'm like, I would rather you be removed from the neighborhood than that guy, believe 
[00:59:00]  it or not.  Jesus.  You got to see the visual because he's all fucked up with his hands.  His hands are moving like a maniac.  And then, of course, I hope is that you?  It looks just like you.  I didn't know you were.  Somebody did that with Jimmy the other day.  Hey, Jimmy, I didn't know you were.  The guy from fucking...  Hey, Opie, you look tired. 
[00:59:30]  So you can check that out on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, my latest video.  I kind of like this guy.  I'm going to do some other videos with him.  It's on the Facebook, too.  Well, thanks for that, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  When we get back, it continues, man.  Mike Francesa.  Another article about him in the sports section.  Good old Mike.  We'll explain.  We got two really good calls from him.  These guys, I don't know if they listen to us as well. 
[01:00:00]  Like I said, I know we share a little bit of audience with Mike Francesa.  So I love getting the word out that we're loving these prank calls to Mike Francesa.  I don't think there are guys.  I don't think so, either.  They sound just like sports people.  Yeah, but it's getting...  Sports fans.  It's getting to the fan base a little bit.  Sports fans!  We're just saying.  We're just one of many trying to encourage this because it's hilarious.  Yeah.  And some other shit.  Oh, we'll do the security video from Atlanta. 
[01:00:30]  Is it worth playing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When the woman really starts getting on them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  And happy Valentine's Day to everyone today.  Happy Valentine's Day!  We're done with Valentine's Day reads, right?  Yep.  Yeah, I mean, we still have 11 reads today, but...  Your popular show.  Wow.  Really?  Should we start now or go to break?  No Valentine's Day, though.  No.  Whatever you want.  Because there's no delivery.  No.  Today.  You could do one right now if you want to.  Well, I want to do Black History Month. 
[01:01:00]  Then do Black History Month, and then stay tuned for a read.  Yeah.  You know, some other places doing inventions this year, too?  I thought that was a wonderful idea.  Yeah, but they're not doing it like we are.  That's what happens.  They hear a great idea, and they try to cash in on it.  They have actual audio.  You know, we have actual audio from the inventor and some gentlemen.  I suggested this thinking there's no way there'd be enough inventions.  That would be of interest for this comedy piece.  We showed you.  Yeah, no shit. 
[01:01:30]  Especially the fact that we have audio of everything being invented.  Yeah, which is great.  I love the black inventions.  They're just hilarious.  It's amazing.  Like, wow, look at that.  Well, you want a new one?  Yeah.  This is for Black History Month.  Love it.  And you still swear that these are real inventions.  They're 100% real inventions.  100% real.  Look it up.  Black people inventing this stuff that we're talking about all month.  I mean, the inventors are named in the piece, and I'm not making up the names.  All right.  Google it.  Google it for yourself if you don't believe.  Here's the latest one.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the great African-American inventors. 
[01:02:00]  Today, we honor Jay Ricks, inventor of the horseshoe.  Well, White Lightning, it's about that time.  Any final words, old friend?  Yo, B, what are you going to kill that horse for, man?  Come on.  Well, these feet of his just don't keep up anymore.  Because they bear as fuck.  What do you mean?  He needs some of these, man.  Well, I'll be. 
[01:02:30]  It's like boots for a horse.  They're shoes, you redneck dick.  Horseshoes.  Whatever suits your fancy.  Oh, she knows what suits my fancy, kid.  Hey there, Stallion.  That's my wife.  The Horseshoe.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Hey, so horny.  Sirius XM.

[01:06:00]  Subway can't rejoice with truth  In the religion of the insecure  I must be myself, respect my youth  Why the Lady Gaga?  What is she, got lupus or something?  Is it lupus?  Well, I don't know what it is  It's got borderline lupus  Borderline lupus  You know what's weird? 
[01:06:30]  Jimmy's not here today  He's on Leno tonight, Kenny?  Yes, sir  What was he on last night?  I get confused  Tonight  Tonight  So, Jim Norton on Jay Leno  Make sure you check that out  I turn on Jimmy's mic  Even though he's not here  Lady Gaga cancels her tour to get hip surgery  She's too young for hip surgery  Well, apparently she's been having joint pain  Because she gets inflammation of the joints  And now she can't walk  That's bullshit  Why is she doing this?  More attention?  She's not getting enough attention?  I don't know  The costume thing isn't working for her anymore 
[01:07:00]  So now she's going to get surgery she doesn't need?  She canceled her whole tour  And says that, yeah, she can't walk  I'm canceling the rest of the tour  See, that's bullshit  Because she's the type of performer  In some strange, weird way  She would do it from a wheelchair  Because that would be, like, cool  That would be cool  She doesn't need hip surgery  She's hip enough  That's right, Anthony  You tell them  Yeah  Right?  But she would be one of the only performers  That would go, you know what?  I will just do the whole tour from a wheelchair  And my fans will eat it up 
[01:07:30]  Is that why she got fat?  Because she couldn't work out or something?  No, she got fat because she wanted people to go  Holy fuck, Lady Gaga's getting fat  What's that about?  Huh?  That's right  100%, right?  I think so  Alright, and you're a Lady Gaga fan  Yeah, I definitely think she gained weight for publicity  She's another one with those catchy songs  I love her  Yeah, of course  You got the shirt and everything  This is a good one, too  This sounds like, uh, Bonnie Raitt 
[01:08:00]  Bonnie Raitt?  Bonnie Raitt  I remember her  What's that big, over-the-top song she did?  I don't know  Looking for a hero  Who did the, uh  I don't remember that one  Is that Bonnie Raitt?  I think so, right?  How's that sound?  I don't know  Whatever  Why are we talking about Lady Gaga?  Bonnie Raitt?  Total Eclipse of the Heart?  Yeah, Total Eclipse of the Heart was the big, over-the-top hit by her  Is the hero line in that song? 
[01:08:30]  I don't think that was Bonnie Raitt, was it?  Not Bonnie Raitt  Bonnie Tyler  Bonnie Tyler, thank you, Anthony  Bonnie Tyler  But you didn't know that, you saw that somewhere  Well, that's true  Oh, Bloomberg wants to now ban styrofoam  Uh-oh  What's that about?  I don't know  What is that about?  He's fucking just trying to ban everything  And put those, uh  Those new parking spots in  Around the city for electric cars  Yeah, that's getting crazy  He wants 20%  He can't park anywhere  He wants 20% of all new parking  That's made in New York 
[01:09:00]  What do you mean?  Uh, like new parking garages  And, uh  Right  Any parking spaces that open up in the city  Sometimes they plow down a building  And they build a parking garage  Right  Um, all  20% of all new parking garages  He wants to have, um  Suitable for electric cars  To be charged at those stations  Wow  He's trying to make this into a green city, huh?  He really thinks, like, he can make this utopian green city  By, uh, by closing streets 
[01:09:30]  And putting flower pots there  And, uh, getting rid of styrofoam  And  Well, I mean, as much as we bitch  He's just trying to catch up with some of the other cities out there  Is he?  Yeah, a lot of these cities are doing all that stuff  We're kind of behind here  I thought he was the cutting edge guy  No, we're not even close  No  No, man, look at our fucking subway system  It looks shitty  Go to any other city in America  They don't have shitty subway systems  But, you know, you gotta give New York credit  The first city to really have them  Um, they're archaic  You know, they just kept putting them together  And probably, um, one of the, um, most populous cities 
[01:10:00]  Right  In the country  Yeah, so why don't we have a kick-ass subway system  Where you want to be down below ground checking it out  Too many people  And we spend money on  What do you mean too many people?  That means they're making a shitload of money  So upgrade our system  They upgraded a little bit here and there  Yeah, they do  I think it's just hard to do when you have people using it every day  It's kind of hard to close it down  You think that's what it's about?  Yeah, I think it's very difficult to do  Mm-hmm  Fair enough  Get those Japanese subways  Where they're riding on magnets 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, well, you know  Everywhere  They were able to put them in  You know, post-World War II  Meanwhile, the New York ones  Started putting those fucking things in the 1800s  Washington, D.C. has an amazing system  Yeah  You feel like you're in the future  When you go down the long escalators  Into those really nice-looking tubes  Yeah  It's a guy robot  It's cool as shit  Ours smell like piss  Boston, not so much  But at least, like, you know  It's kind of  Theirs is cool 
[01:11:00]  Because it's just old school in a nice way  If that makes sense  You feel like you're going back in time  Best systems in Hong Kong?  Hong Kong!  You know, I heard something once  King Kong  Yeah  Apparently  Uh-huh  Went to Hong Kong, right?  What happened?  And he played ping-pong  Uh-huh  With his ding-dong  Oh, my God  I heard that  Wow  I think it's a true story  Iraq, you're mad you can't find parking in New York City?  No, I  That's the biggest scam going  You know that, right?  They've taken away every parking spot 
[01:11:30]  Because they want to give you guys  Including myself, tickets  Yeah  They're all about giving out those tickets  Mm-hmm  It's a big money-maker for the city  Wow  Moscow looks pretty bitchy  Even Moscow  That's what I'm trying to say  So it's pretty much any place that we've attacked or destroyed  Has better systems  Well, yeah  Moscow?  When would we do that?  Cold War  Oh, oh  You know, I hear they serve you vegetable medley in that tube, too  It's great  Well, you know  Iraq doesn't lie, though  I mean  After we had our fun with Japan  We did them a favor 
[01:12:00]  They upgraded everything  They had to  Well, reconstruction  They had to  So they got all kick-ass new shit  Wait, six is the  Wait, what are we looking at?  The top subway systems in the world  In the world, okay  In the world  So ten is Barcelona  Yeah  Look at how nice that is  Barcelona  You look like you're in an art museum waiting for your subway  Pyongyang?  Yeah, the art museum is Pyongyang  Pyongyang  Well, where's the other one?  They just have a picture of the map  Oh 
[01:12:30]  That's the map of Barcelona  Oh, so the number is below the picture we're looking at  Yeah  Sometimes that confuses me  I know, right?  On these top ten lists  Okay, so it's Pyongyang  Pyongyang  Pyongyang style  Pyongyang style  Looks like you're in a museum as you wait for your subway  Yeah, it's nice  Very nice  Very clean  Holy shit, it's clean  I've been to a few cities  And I'm like, why can't we have this shit in New York?  Because New York's got slobs living in it  It's terrible  Where's that? 
[01:13:00]  Montreal  I've seen the Montreal  I've seen the Montreal subway as well  And it is very nice  Yes  Yeah, it looks pretty cool right there  Let's keep going  Seven is Moscow  That looks futuristic  Very round  Very shiny floor  Yep  That looks clean as a whistle, too  And then this is where the list gets stupid  Six is New York City  New York City  That's not  It's not a nice system  No  Are they talking about an efficient system?  What are they talking about there?  Read the New York one  They're saying it's like an FU subway 
[01:13:30]  What?  The stations are grimy and have rats  The cars are totally overcrowded  The switches and rails are all worn out  For all its flaws  It covers an absolutely massive metro area  And runs all day every day  It sucks, but it works  So they're saying that the efficiency of the system  Makes up for its aesthetic  Right  You are guaranteed to see a rat  Almost every time you go underground  Yeah  If you're bored waiting for a subway  When you're visiting New York  Just go to the edge 
[01:14:00]  But make sure no fucking subways are coming  Because they will push you over  As we know now  And you will see a rat almost every time  If there's not enough train action  The rats come out to just take a nibble or two  And then when they hear the vibrations  Of the fucking trains coming  Then they all scatter again  But you will see one almost every time  If you're out walking around at like 5 o'clock in the morning  Yeah  You don't have to go underground to see them  I just haven't seen a rat lately above ground  Dude, there's a supermarket by where my parking lot is in the morning 
[01:14:30]  Right  Every single morning  How many?  I've seen a dozen rats outside that supermarket  Every day?  Every day I see rats outside the supermarket  Every day, guaranteed  Every day I see rats crawling around  Film that shit  Okay  People from other lands  They love seeing rats  They love seeing rats  And they love photographing squirrels in Central Park  I'll never understand that one  I guess because  From where they're from  They don't see squirrels  Because to us, squirrels are whatever  Aren't they? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah  They get amazed when they see a squirrel in Central Park  They stop walking  And they're like  They take out their cameras  They're filming  They're taking pictures  Jesus  On a windy day  I've thought that leaves were blowing across the sidewalk  Right  And then I realized it's a pack of rats running  And it's outside a supermarket  Yep  That means they're in the supermarket  Absolutely  And that's why you gotta wash your fruit and vegetables, right?  Thoroughly  I never wash my fruits and vegetables  New York City is not a great place for grocery shopping  I don't know why I don't wash my fruits and vegetables 
[01:15:30]  Do you wash your fruits and vegetables?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I don't  Ange does  Yeah  I don't do anything  You have a person for that  Someone actually washes my fruits and vegetables  No, because she goes shopping  She does the shopping  And then she washes them  And puts them away  I just don't do it  I don't believe it  Boy, she's got a fucking disaster to come over to today  Why?  She's been ill for the past couple of days  She hasn't been feeling good  And, you know, I don't  I can't take care of myself  You haven't been picking up the slack in her accent? 
[01:16:00]  Fuck no  Why?  I'm terrible  I literally have  My toys are all over the place  Right  All of my mail and stuff is strewn all over the table  And laundry  It's like I'm performing a fucking fashion show on a daily basis  I go through ten costume changes a day  Clothes  To come in here?  I don't know  Once I get home  I shower  And then I change there again  And then later on in the night  I might want to put like sweats on  And a different shirt  So I just throw that on the floor 
[01:16:30]  There's clothes everywhere in the house  Every room  Just thrown about  Thrown about  And then  There's like a dish with dried up macaroni in it  On the living room table  And then there's a half glass of wine  Sitting on another table  It's just a disaster  You see the two shirts I'm wearing?  Yeah  Got them off my floor this morning  Did you?  And they didn't smell too bad  Did you do the test?  Yeah  You know  It doesn't matter how much money you make 
[01:17:00]  You still live the way you fucking used to  I'm like alright  This one isn't too bad today  Yeah  Yeah  The fuck  Any shirts that I wear with an undershirt  Literally  You smell the armpits  As long as the armpits are fine  It's not a dirty shirt  Everywhere else  You don't have to smell the front  No  You smell the backside of your jeans  Always  I've worn these jeans for like probably a week and a half  The backside's fine  I smell the backside  And there have been days where I sit there thinking if I can get away with it or not  Febreze  I actually  Jesus  I smell it 
[01:17:30]  I'm like man  I don't know  These are kind of on the fence  I might be able to get one more day  Why don't you do the laundry?  I'm getting a whiff  I swear to you  I got ten  At least ten pairs of jeans waiting to wear  Then why don't you wear them?

[01:19:00]  Inspect it for awesomeness  I was going to say  Remember the rule was  You wore a rock star shirt  When it was laundry day  So whenever somebody was wearing it  Oh you're doing your laundry  And then next day they're back  In their rotation  You're like day four of wearing a rock star shirt  And you got the rainbow rock star colors  You should have wore that yesterday  Rainbow gay shirt  You should have worn that yesterday  You're trying to get the gay out  Well  You're wearing your rainbow shirt today  Look sometimes when there's a lack of clean laundry  You gotta go with the gay  Alright where are we at  Six is New York City  But they're basically admitting  It's a shitty system  But  Shitty as far as

[01:21:30]  The train pulls in  And the gates go down  Somehow  Way shape or form  And somebody might get  Their foot stuck in there  Or something  But then they just go  Oh I was very stupid  Yeah  I should not have been there  In America  It would be  You are  I'm so in the city  Right  Yeah  You know  We're lifetime New Yorkers  I mean I took a 20 year detour  Doing radio jobs  But I am a  I am a lifetime New Yorker  Yeah  Long Island and what's not  In your honest opinion  Why can't we modernize New York City 
[01:22:00]  Like you do see these other places  They do figure it out  I think it's so crowded  And such an important fucking hub  Of freedom and democracy  In the free world  You don't think it has something to do  With corruption over the years  Well maybe  And a lot of fucking red tape  That other  Unions  Probably no one  Unions  Yeah what is it  It's probably no one thing  But man  I mean when you go to  Some of these other cities  You realize how behind  New York really is  Yeah 
[01:22:30]  I don't want to  Clink my ice  Why who cares  Who cares  Who gives a fuck  Yeah  I was  Really thinking about  Going on a cruise  This year  We're going on a cruise  Because  You know  With the two kids  Makes it tough to fly around  Like I used to  Yeah  I used to love my flying around  Down in the Caribbean stuff  Do you have your cabana wear? 
[01:23:00]  Huh?  You need cabana wear  No  You do all that  I saw all your videos  You do all that  I don't think I would  Fucking shop  Especially for a cruise  Oh come on  I  We were really close to  Pulling the trigger  And doing a cruise  Just because it would be  A little easier  Yeah  This year  And then maybe go back  To flying next year  Uh huh  What the fuck  Is going on with that cruise ship?  Well that's carnival man  Oh boy  And why the fuck  Can't they  Why couldn't they  Fly in supplies  Sooner?  Why was the cruise ship  Allowed to go 
[01:23:30]  500 miles  Off course?  Hmm  Well that's the company  I think  I think they're  All the  Ixnay  Let's  Let's take care of this  Ourselves  Let's not get bad publicity  And then things  Kind of escalate  And then they're like  Alright we need some help  Oh so they were hoping  Oh so they kept it  Under the  Under the QT  Or whatever  Well I think  They tried to  Handle it themselves  At first  So what  They kind of like  Flew some guys in  That might know how to  Put an engine back together  Yeah  Is it an engine problem? 
[01:24:00]  Well this is a  Yeah they had a fire  That affected the engine  And the engine  You know it was everything  To those ships  Power and all kinds of shit  And then after a while  It's like  Okay now we  You know  We got to tow this thing in  500 miles off course though?  That's crazy right?  And then they only started  Flying in some  Applies what  Yesterday or two days ago  At this point?  Yeah  It got to the point  Where they were  Handing out onion sandwiches?  Yeah  It should never get to the point  Where they're giving out 
[01:24:30]  Onion sandwiches  I bet they tried to make it exciting  Ladies and gentlemen  This evening on the Lido deck  Onion sandwiches  Come on  Ding ding ding ding ding ding  People were shitting in bags  And leaving it outside their rooms?  This is your vacation?  Yes  There was apparently  Like sewage  Sloshing in the hallways  Oh my  On some of the decks  And people are just squeezed out on the decks  Trying to get fresh air all day long  Yeah  Crowding themselves  Yep  Two hour lines  To get onion sandwiches 
[01:25:00]  To get the onion sandwiches  Yeah  Stand on lines  Just a disaster  They're towing them in  At under five knots  To Mobile, Alabama  Which they don't even get  Which they don't even get a nice destination  Some of the people  Are going to want to get back on the ship  After they get off  On Mobile  Fucking Alabama  Good old Mobile  Yeah  Did I add it?  What else was going on  On that cruise ship?  Imagine conga lining  Through fucking raw sewage  You're just kicking your feet up  And big lumps of shit  Are splashing on the wall 
[01:25:30]  As you're just conga lining  Through duty  Doing the limbo, man  Yeah, yeah  You fuck up the limbo  You're going to get a back full of shit  The girl's hair is fucking dredging  Through the fucking shit water  People are actually sleeping on the deck  Yeah, I know  Yeah, because their rooms  It's so stuffy  Their rooms are shot  They bailed on their rooms  A while ago  Especially the ones  That don't have the windows  Hot, hot, hot  4,000 fucking people  Just stuck  And they don't have a system  Where they can get these people 
[01:26:00]  Off the fucking cruise ship  Oh, I think to do that  Would be a huge liability  Oh, you think?  Yeah, you can't do that  You can't just helicopter people  Off the ship all day long  That's crazy  And why would the company  Want to tie up  An entire another cruise ship  Well, if they brought  Guess what?  They have no choice  You're 500 miles off course  And there's sewage rivers  In the hallways  I mean, where are they going to do it?  Then you've got to deal with  The people that were booked  To be on that ship  Right  The ship that they use  Is like the rescue ship  It's a fine ecosystem, right? 
[01:26:30]  The cruise industry  You've got to fucking  Keep everything on schedule  Because now they're fucked  I heard this cruise ship  It's going to be out of commission  For at least a month  A month and a half  Yeah  That's a lot of cruises  They're going to  You know, lose out on  Carnival's the worst  They had something happen  Last year, too  Yeah  Why is Carnival the worst?  That's Anthony's opinion  It's the cheapest  It's the party cruise  I think we're safe  I think we're safe to say  They're the worst  Considering the situation at hand  It's the cheapest one  They're ships  They have, I think, 
[01:27:00]  The oldest ships  Out of all the cruise lines  I like Royal Caribbean  Wait, you said they're the what?  The cheapest?  The cheapest, yeah  And the oldest  Enjoy your Twitter later  Oh, not all of us  Can afford  You forgot where you came from  Oh, I bet when you were knocking tin  You know, there's a lot of us  That's all we can afford 
[01:27:30]  Aids  I went on a carnival cruise  It was great  It doesn't matter what the fuck you say  There's an idiot out there  There's an idiot out there  That's exactly what they would say  I'm proud of the Twitter voice invention  I love the Twitter  It's one of my proudest fucking inventions  It's all I do when I read Twitter now  Is  Boo!  Aids!  But it should be said  It should be said 
[01:28:00]  Because I think people do have  Most, most  As far as my feed goes  And my followers  Most of them are beyond cool  Yeah, yeah  And these guys  These guys  It's so obvious now  Yeah  How ridiculous  A very small percentage  Of these people are  They look like idiots now  Oh really, do we?  Yeah, you do  Anyway, you were saying  It's the worst cruise line  Yeah, yeah  I've just heard 
[01:28:30]  Horrible things about it  It's  You get something like  Royal Caribbean  That's a good cruise line  Even Norwegian  I enjoyed going on Norwegian  Royal Caribbean  Norwegian's new ships are awesome  Yeah, Norwegian's got some crazy new ships  I saw one  And I don't know if it was like  They were fucking around with the commercial  Because a lot of times  In my house  The fucking audio's down  Because we're doing shit  It was a cruise line  And it looked like  A mini city  With the buildings  On the top  Were they just fucking with that 
[01:29:00]  For the commercial?  Yeah, that was for the commercial  Oh, it wasn't the actual cruise ship  No  Okay, because I was like  What the fuck?  It looked like a mini version  Of like, let's say  Midtown Manhattan  With all the buildings  Yeah  The big thing to do with them now  Is the whole center of the ship  Is to look like Central Park  Yeah, yeah  They make these giant  Big walkways  Through the middle of the ship  They have actual stores  And restaurants  Yeah, it's like a mall  And then they also have  Interior balcony rooms now  Amazing  Where instead of having  The room with the balcony 
[01:29:30]  On the outside of the ship  They're on the inside  So you can look in  At people walking around  Oh, that could be kind of cool  It's fucking just amazing  These things  Huge hotels  That could be kind of cool, yeah  But the thing is  Those motors  That runs the show  Those old Carnival ships  There was a period  Between the late 80s  To early 90s  Where Carnival was doing  A tie-in to sitcoms  So like the sitcom  Would go on a cruise  Oh, wow  Like Growing Pains  Did a couple episodes  On a cruise ship  One or two of those ships 
[01:30:00]  I think until recently  Were still active  Still active  And they're supposed  To switch them up  Every like 10 years  Yeah, if you don't  Modernize the ships  And you can tell  Like the ones that look  Like giant bricks  Placed on a boat  They're just big square  They got no form to them  You see a lot of  The European cruise lines  Look like that  Yeah, they're just terrible  With the little tiny balconies  On this just wall  Of rooms on the sides  Of the ship  What makes the  Norwegians so amazing? 
[01:30:30]  Well, Royal Caribbean  And Norwegian  They're new ships  They're newer ships  They're giant  They have all the  Modern amenities  They're the biggest  Ships in the world  Yeah, just fucking  Giant ships  I think you  If next time  Like the Epic  Or something  That comes into  Manhattan here  I think they allow you  During that downtime  On a Sunday or Monday  You can get a visitor's pass  To look around the lobby  Oh, no kids  Just go away  I gotta check it out  Now, E-Rock  I'm a guy  I need to be out and about  Yeah 
[01:31:00]  Would I feel claustrophobic  On a cruise ship?  I've never done one of these  Over-the-top cruise ships  You think you need to do  A million things  When you go on a cruise ship  But most of the time  It's like  There's all these activities  In place to go  But in the morning  You just throw a towel down  By the pool  And then you're just  Laying out there  And drinking all day  Dude, they got  All kinds of shit  Like to do  And it's a giant  You don't realize  How big it is  Until you're  So you don't feel crowded?  No  That's so weird  And you don't even  Feel the waves anymore  Especially if you use  A little bit of your  Fucking cash  Right  That way you get  One of these rooms 
[01:31:30]  That are  It has their own area  Their own little pool area  Right  Their own lounge area  The butler and piano  Yeah, the butler  The piano  You don't have to go  In the general population  I just can't wrap my head  Around it  And then you're stopping  At islands  No, I know  But I can't wrap my head  Around the fact that  All of this is  In one boat  On the water  It's crazy  I can't wrap my head  It really does get you  When you think about it  You're just like  Holy fuck  This is amazing  When you're taking a shower  In some of those rooms  They got a giant window  That just overlooks the ocean 
[01:32:00]  And you shower  And then you turn around  And realize  Oh yeah, I'm in a ship  That's so weird  Not in a hotel  And you can get up  Early in the morning  They got Starbucks  Or an equivalent  To Starbucks  On all these ships  I'm an early riser, E-Rock  So that would be good for me  I hope you'd be  Walking around the deck  That's right  Everybody else is  Coming out hungover  That's right  Steuben  Is this a live read?  That's funny  That would be good  We should get fucking  Send this break off  To Royal Caribbean  That's right 
[01:32:30]  Let's get some free  Fucking trips  For our listeners  Ah, let's go live  This used to be their  Big commercial  They show them rock climbing  I used to love this song  Really?  Yes  Man, they killed this song for me  Jeff in Orlando  What's up?  Hey, so  Let me tell you a carnival story  A few years ago  Went on a cruise  Out of Cape Canaveral  With my wife and kids  And another couple of their kids  And first of all  We booked the cruise  A couple months beforehand 
[01:33:00]  And we looked at pictures  Of the boat  Then we got there  And it turned out  It was a Katrina  Refugee boat  So they'd removed  All the decorations  So there was  Nothing on the walls  All you could see  Were sort of like  The faded area  On the carpet  On the walls  Where there were pictures  They took all the  Sculptures out of the center  Of the boat  Because it was a refugee boat  So after we got on  They gave us hot dogs  Which is great  And then  You know  You did that  Practice evacuation 
[01:33:30]  Yeah  They did the practice evacuation  Then they actually  Evacuated the boat  And put us in a parking lot  For eight hours  While they checked  While they checked the boat  For a possible bomb threat  Sounds great  Why would they  It was awesome  Why would they put you  On a boat  That was a refugee ship  Without like  Putting it back  Into service  And redecorating it  It's carnival  Did you get  A refund or something  Oh yeah  After the bomb threat  We got back on the boat 
[01:34:00]  We got our bags  And left  And they gave a refund  And I got the feeling  That they give a lot of refund  Man  They were really  Really good at it  This guy  There's so many  Cruise ship stories  Coming in  This guy  I don't have time  But he said  He went on a  Carnival ship  When he was 16  Then went again  When he turned 30  It was the exact same shit  The same shit  Is that possible  That's what this guy said  Yeah  You know  Totally possible  And then the other thing  With the cruise ship  That's having the problem  And they're slowly  Getting it to Mobile  Alabama  They can't get in their rooms 
[01:34:30]  Because no electricity  They can't use  Their electric keys  They're a little electric key  There's no work around  For that  You'd think there would be  There is  But they'd have to make  A duplicate for everybody  Well too fucking bad  I would  I would  I swear  I would find something  And I would break down the door  To get into my own room  You'd have to imagine  Everyone  4,000 angry people  Are trying to just  Do things  Of course  And get answers  Imagine the crew  Must be flustered  You'd think they're like 
[01:35:00]  Sequestered  Deep in the ship somewhere  Housekeeping's nowhere  To be found  Just hiding  Just hiding  Don't let him find us  We're here  Could be the one guy yelling  I need towels  Yeah  Fucking towels  You bitch  You think there's a lot  Of yelling  A lot of yelling  If you want a good video  That would be the time  To do it  Oh yeah  Some guy said  He got phone calls  From his wife  Who was on the ship  And he goes  It's just  The entire time  Her and her girlfriends  That he went with  That she went with  Just crying 
[01:35:30]  On the phone  She goes  Every call  It's them  Crying  So imagine  All these women  Crying  Men yelling  For things  This is going to be  Awful  Some lawsuits  Oh yeah  I was on the Norwegian  Let me  What the fuck  Dennis  On Long Island  Dennis  Hey what's going on guys  Good morning  Good morning  Good morning  Yeah  I was on the Epic  For my honeymoon  And we got on the ship  That morning in Rome  And you can't possibly 
[01:36:00]  See everything  You know  The food  You get sick of a  Food of the Wild  There's like 12 restaurants  From French  To Italian  To a huge steakhouse  Dude I never even went  I was on the Epic  And I never went  To the actual  Place where you're  Supposed to eat dinner  Like their  Main dining hall  Main dining hall  Yeah  Why  You should have  Just to check it out  I went to all the restaurants  Oh  It's floor to ceiling  In the back restaurant  The food was okay  In that restaurant  We went there  But the bands  That play there  All night long  I mean we spent 
[01:36:30]  Five hours  In the comedy bar  During doing pianos  During doing pianos  Yeah  And all you do  Is drink  They're buying people  Drinks  It was amazing  And then one night  I ordered  I ordered food  From one of the restaurants  To bring it to the room  They brought it  Like I was in the restaurant  They set up the table  Like it was the restaurant  And had like a waiter  That would come to the room  And wait on you  Oh so  You go on that ship  Everyone gets a waiter?

[01:37:30]  To see the breakaway  Which is coming out  Of New York soon  And it's amazing  I had a balcony view  You can only imagine  Every day they come  They clean their room  Fresh towels  A problem with towels  Oh you should see  What they do  When you grease the guy  500 bucks  The second you step  On the ship  I gave my fucking butler  500 bucks  And mother  That guy  Couldn't be there enough  Wow  That was great  He would actually  He would actually  Come in  And wipe the cum  Off of the girl's back

[01:39:00]  How are they testing  All this shit out  It's amazing  It's a water park  On the boat  Yeah yeah  Yeah  Not a slide  A park  That's amazing  The new Disney ships  Yeah  Have these clear water tubes  So when you do the water slide  Shoots you off the ship  You go off the side  Now you're just hanging  Over the ocean  While in the tube  And then it swings you back  At an angle real fast  Where you come right back  Onto the ship  Into the pool  Holy shit  I really do want to  Do one of these cruises  Yeah  Absolutely  The Epic  Has like  Has a bowling alley

[01:44:00]  Oh my goodness  It must be just terrible  So we're getting word  That it should be  And of course  As you know  These things change a lot  But sometime around 7.30  Maybe 8 o'clock  This evening  Is when that ship  Will be coming in  Oh God  That's going to be great  Load up on those sound clips  For tomorrow  Can I fly down  I will have my viral video  Yes  Let me play that for you  Uh oh  What's this  The apology  Yeah  What a doodle  I think it's very important  That I apologize  To our guests  This guy 
[01:44:30]  And to their families  That have been affected  By this very difficult situation  At Carnival  Our promise to our guests  Is to provide  A great vacation experience  We try very hard  To do that  You fell miserably  It's obvious  In this particular case  We did not deliver  On that promise  Well  Yeah  That might be  The understatement  Of the year  What they've been offering  From what we know  Is a $500 per person  Compensation  Full refund  Of the cruise  And related travel  A bus ride  Or a chartered flight  Out of there  And a 15 to 25 percent  And a 15 to 25 percent  Discount on a future cruise 
[01:45:00]  When you hear  When you hear  That apology  And sort of  The list of things  That they're offering  For compensation  What's your reaction  Yeah  I'm standing  And I'm just shaking  My head  I cannot imagine  That the horror  That they have had  To deal with  With no food  Lines to go to the bathroom  Seeing urine and feces  Sloshing in the halls  Closing floor  Nothing to eat  $500 
[01:45:30]  What are we  What's the emotional  What's the emotional cost  I can't put money on that  What is my 12 year old  Daughter saying  What is  What is she saying  I don't understand  You know  As you're describing  That ladies  Lou's on our panel  This morning  Is saying that  He's curious  If you think  Your daughters  Are going to need  Counseling  And then who  Would underwrite that  Only in America  Yeah of course  A cruise gone wrong  The kid needs counseling  Why is she alone 
[01:46:00]  On a fucking cruise  And will you try  To get them  Someone to talk to  I swear to you  I would turn this  Into a good time  For myself  Yeah  I'm not sure  With a family  But if I'm there  By myself  I swear  I would have a good time  Because I'm living  Through something  A little different  Right  If they're laughing  We don't know  If they're huddled up  In a corner crying  They're probably  Huddled crying  They're wanting to get  Out of that boat  We have no communication  That's what's lacking here  We're going to speak  To our daughters  Then we're going  To see their  All right  All kidding aside 
[01:46:30]  I mean it is  A fucking horrific situation  Like I don't understand  How it got so bad  Where there's just  Feces in the hallway  Feces  They're eating  Onion sandwiches  Like what's going on  With this company  That they're not prepared  For like  This is pretty much  A disaster  For these families  Yeah  Yeah  Why can't they  Figure it out  There has to be  Some kind of system  In place  Before it gets  To the point  Where they're  Putting their  Feces in bags  I have no idea  Why it got to that point  And you gotta think 
[01:47:00]  They've run out of  Bags by now  Oh they're just  Shitting over the side  There's probably  Big shit  Like shit streaks  Down the balcony  It's gotten past that  They probably tried  At first  To shit over the side  Now they're just  Shitting wherever they can  You know  I take three dumps a day  And I'm not  And I would continue  With my dump schedule  If the hallways  Are full of shit  You might as well  Just go in the hallway  And take a dump  I'm serious  But how does it  Get to that point  Oh no  How desperate  Is this company  And then they're only  Offering them  A $500 voucher  And what  That's it  And this cruise  Is paid for hopefully 
[01:47:30]  No  What do you mean  They're offering you  A $500 voucher  And then any travel  To and from the cruise  Travel  Cruise related travel  They're offering you  A refund on  Right  What do you mean  And then 20%  Off the next cruise  Or something  Wow  Yeah  Wow they're fucked  This could  This could sink the company  Who would want to  Who would want to go  On one of their ships  Anytime soon  I think the insurance  Takes care of it  Yeah no I understand  But it's going to  Hurt future business  Yeah it might  Why would they 
[01:48:00]  Only do that  Why wouldn't they say  Alright obviously  This fucking cruise  We're refunding everybody  Yeah  We'll get you home  For free  And then  Then give them  Some money  On top of that  I don't know  They probably assumed  That wouldn't be enough  For people  And people would sue  Anyway  So they're just  Probably just  Waiting it out  For the  The lawsuits  Now Victor  Is this guy  Victor Blackwell  Speak  Why isn't he talking 
[01:48:30]  He's just  Falling in camera time  He's just standing there  We're obviously  Having some  Technical problems  Obviously  As he is in  Mobile Bay  On a boat  And we're waiting  For the ship  To come in  Exactly that direction  But as we've been told  It'll be sometime  Around 7.30 this evening  8 o'clock this evening  Oh my god  I am watching TV  Tonight  Yeah I want to see  That's going to be  Great TV  I definitely want to see  Some of those  Fucking people  Bitching and complaining  Absolutely 
[01:49:00]  Oh wait  Now we got a helicopter  That's right Soledad  They're actually  Farther out  Than anticipated  At this hour  We're flying just south  Of the mouth  Of Mobile Bay  And we were expecting  To see the ship  In about an hour or so  But again  They're delayed  You have to keep in mind  They are moving  At only 8 knots  8 knots  Which is basically  9 miles per hour  It's a very  Tough job  They have  Four tugboats  Basically escorting  This ship  Towards this area  What do they usually do  22, 23 
[01:49:30]  27 knots  Yeah  They're not expected  To arrive here  Until later this evening  They can't even see  The ship yet  Because they don't want  To take the helicopter  Out that far  Is that what's going on  Maybe yeah  Oh my god  This is a great story  Oh they are going to be  Some angry people  They're probably going  To tell them  Ladies and gentlemen  Please avoid speaking  With the media  When you leave the ship  Yeah right  You think they're just  Throwing furniture  And everything  I'd be throwing shit 
[01:50:00]  Over the side  I would be  Yeah  Clear my room out  By throwing everything  Fuck yeah  Over the side of the ship  That'd be hilarious  That's a great story  I can't wait to hear it  As well  Thank you for that update  Let's get right to  John Berman  For a look at some  Other stories  Making news today  Thank you so much  Soledad  We are getting to hear  From some of the victims  Who survived  Close encounters  With fugitive ex-cop  Christopher Dorner  Dorner story  Yes  That was funny  There's some jokes  He was celebrating  Ash Wednesday 
[01:50:30]  Yeah that was the obvious joke  Because he burnt  Yeah  Somebody mad  Saying Mobile  Is a nice place to live  Relax  You know what  For the rest of the country  Mobile  Is portrayed as a shithole  So you know  John in Mobile  Alabama  You got a bad rep  Dude  Mobile is not a damn  Bad place to live  I grew up in Miami  And I live in Mobile  Now  And  God damn  Everybody here 
[01:51:00]  Drink  It's a damn Catholic place  More than  Baptist  And all that shit  It's a port city  Dude  Do you understand  That for the rest of the country  That doesn't even  Really know the ins and outs  Of Mobile  That Mobile has a reputation  Of being a shitty city  We just finished  Mardi Gras  He's trying to sell it  This guy's the  Department of Tourism guy  Why would you want  More people living there  Yeah  Iraq  Comment  Does anybody remember  That Mobile is where 
[01:51:30]  They saw the Leprechaun  Right  Oh boy  Oh yeah  We're going to  Find that for the break  Yeah  That's a little  Good example of Mobile  Yeah  We'll give you a nice  Example of Mobile  Alabama  Yeah  We haven't played this  In a while  What  They got an FYE  In Mobile  No shit  Really  I still have a gift  Card for FYE  Well  Probably the last place  Where there's actually  An FYE in business  I'm going to fly there  Just to use my gift card  I think  I hate wasting gift cards  Oh yeah  That is a bad thing to do  Carnival is part of

[01:53:00]  It suddenly disappears  This amateur sketch  Resembles what many of you  Say the leprechaun  Looks like  Others find it  Hard to believe  And have come up  With their own theories  And explanations  For the image  My theory is  It's casting a shadow  From the other limb  Could be a crackhead  That got home  To the wrong stuff  And it told him  To get up in a tree  And play a leprechaun  We don't get down  To the bottom of this  Yeah, stay it on there  Guy, don't be afraid

A little bit  Oh  So why does Bloomberg  Want to ban  Styrofoam?  That's where that  Last break started  And then we went  All over the fucking place  And I need to know why  Does anyone know why?  I guess it's very 
[01:55:00]  It's not good  Unenvironmental  Or something  Yeah  Because it's hard to recycle  I get it  Mayor who has already  Targeted fat, sugar, and salt  In the city  Will turn to  Oh boy  Oh boy  Styrofoam  Basically  They have the real name for it  I'm not going to even  Attempt to try to  Polypropylene  You messed up too there, sir  What is it?  We'll turn to 
[01:55:30]  Extruded  Polystyrene  Foam  Saying it clogs up  Landfills  Does not biodegrade  It might harm  Human teeth  What?  I added that part  Oh  You ever  Chew on styrofoam?  Ow  It's kind of fun, no?  Um  No  So  I don't think it's fun  Can we get rid of styrofoam?  As a society, you think?  We use it a lot  We love our styrofoam 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we really do  Why can't it break down?  If it came from the earth  Why doesn't it just break down?  That's what I think about everything  Yeah, I don't think we really make pollution  We take stuff  And then we mix them together  But  It all came from the earth  Yeah, it's all earth shit  We're not pulling shit from outer space  That's real pollution  Yeah, anything from outer space  You bring that shit back from outer space  Now you're polluting the earth  But everything  But if you're just digging around  And finding shit  And combining it with other shit  And you make this shit  Yeah  And then I  I always used to laugh at Earth Day 
[01:56:30]  Because I'm like, wait  So you want us to clean up our area  And then just move the garbage somewhere  Somewhere else  And that means we're helping the planet  That's so stupid  Yeah, what's the difference?  As far as the planet's concerned  Right  Yeah  We're just moving our shit around  Yeah, let's move it around  It's just feel better as human beings, I guess  It's like cleaning your room  And you take your shit from one side of the room  And you move it to the other  Right  Room's not clean  It's not  Wow  It's so dumb  It really is dumb when you break it down 
[01:57:00]  We used to have to go in the schoolyard  For Earth Day  And like clean up the whole fucking thing  Jesus  Yeah  You made you police the area, huh?  Clean up  Yep  Assholes and elbows  Yep  Get down on the ground  Pick that shit up  Mike Francesa  Ah, yes  He's becoming one of my faves  Yeah  He really is  And I laugh every time  One of you guys sends me the  Frank  Frank  The Mike Francesa head on  Somebody's body  Yeah  The snowblower one was the last one I got 
[01:57:30]  Where it's just giant head  You've seen him enter the wrestling ring, right?  Oh, yeah  Yeah  You got that real fast?  Yeah, they've taken  We'll just do it for us  Because we don't have a visual on the show  But somebody  I caught from yesterday  Somebody put Mike Francesa's giant head on  Somebody entering  Entering the wrestling arena  You know  Going down the aisle and all that shit  And it's just this big dopey head  On a wrestler's body  You don't know where that is, Sam Roberts?  You're a big WWE fan  That thing has made the rounds 
[01:58:00]  You're in images  I know  It's an image  No  It's actually a video  Oh my god, Sam  With his head moving  Why aren't you listening?  Oh, it's a gif  Yeah, it's probably  Oh my god  It might be a meme  It might be a meme  A meme  It might be a meme  A meme  A meme  A meme  A meme  A meme  I know what you're talking about  Come on, Sam  Is it  I think it's the one  Is it a gif or is it a meme  What was the other word? 
[01:58:30]  I can't  Meme  No, it's a meme  What was the other one you came up with?  Oh, we would always  What was the one we were just doing the other day?  Oh, yes  Yeah, there it is  It's Vince McMahon  With my princess's head on him  Vince strutting to the ring  So stupid  But fucking makes me laugh every time  Strutting  What was the other word?  Oh, not entrance  Entenman  There was another one  Entenman  What was the other one, Iraq?  You know? 
[01:59:00]  It wasn't like linoleum or something, right?  No  It's going to drive me nuts  I think we were doing it off air  Entenman  Oh, yeah  There's the Ray Lewis fucking  Yeah  That ridiculous dance  That we don't have to see anymore  Yeah  But it's Mike Francesa's head on Ray Lewis' body  They fucking  Who does this?  They're hilarious, though  Why did people  Why did they pick Francesa's head?  He does have a big head  You can never show your weakness  Because then, you know, people take advantage of that 
[01:59:30]  Yeah  And with Mike Francesa  They're taking advantage of the fact that he gets really bothered by this shit  And then he tries to tell everyone he's not being bothered  Yeah, those prank calls  But it's so obvious he's bothered  Mm-hmm  And he's in the paper again today  A big article in the sports section  Because of a prank call that he received yesterday on his show  Oh  And we got it here for you today  In case you haven't heard  And Mike Francesa, I don't think he's syndicated, is he?  No, he's just in New York on FAM, but he's also on the MSG Network  Yeah, okay  So a lot of Americans probably knows who he is by now 
[02:00:00]  Oh, sorry, the Yes Network  Yeah, okay  So he's doing his little sports talk show yesterday  And this happened  Nick in Bohemia, what's up, Nick?  Hey, Mike, how are you?  Good  Listen, as a Mets fan, I mean, you really can't be too confident going into it  No  Well, I wouldn't be confident this year  I mean, you can't  But I want to just talk Piazza with you for a second  Do you think if it does come out that he is gay  That he'll be the, you know, best homosexual catcher we've ever seen?  I would think he would be the best homosexual catcher 
[02:00:30]  I would agree with that, yeah  I mean, you know  I think that's true  But I don't know of any others anyway  Oh my God  You didn't understand the whole catcher reference here, did you?  But the paper's, like, all about it today  Yeah  Because they're now saying that Mike Francesa thinks Mike Piazza's gay  Oh, yeah, because he didn't just say, yeah, I think he would be  And he goes, I don't know of any other ones  Yeah  But Mike, you know, Mike Piazza swears he's not 
[02:01:00]  He's married  But why would the paper  He has a book out, I think  That's why he's being talked about again  Yeah, basically saying no, man  Why would the paper report that as a real story?  It's obviously a prank phone call  That Mike Francesa had no idea what to do with  So he just answered  The paper's so stupid, the news  They don't get  Like that woman from yesterday  When we played the clip of the prank call  From Howard's show  All right  I mean, they don't know  They just  They don't know anything 
[02:01:30]  And it just  It amazes me to this day  How little they really know  Yeah  Because I always looked at TV  Like it's this great place  Where these people are very knowledgeable  Oh yeah  And I still, like, get tricked into all that shit  And then you realize most of them  Are just a bunch of dummies  That, you know, read shit  They're readers  They read teleprompters  And that's it  Have you checked out  Robin Mead yet?  Mm-mm  Holy fuck  What's that all about?  Robin Mead  She's on CNN Headline News 
[02:02:00]  And she's basically  She's getting a little older now  But she's basically a playmate  Oh, yeah  Wow  Holy fuck  Yeah  And she was filling in for Piers Morgan last night  Yeah  I don't even know what she was saying  I was just watching her  She's no kid  But she's got a  I looked her up  She's 40  She's 43  Really?  You're looking at 43 right there  She's got a good body on her there  And she was filling in for Piers Morgan 
[02:02:30]  And I was just staring at her  I swear to you  I didn't give a fuck what she was saying  You think those are natural breasts?  Hell no  Hell no  But she's on Headline News every morning  Yeah  Her teeth are extremely white  Mm  But she  Look at what she wears  She's wearing go-go boots  And a fucking  Little mini skirt  Tiny polka dot  And then she tries to  Geek herself up with those glasses  And the big fucking  Librarian bun on her head 
[02:03:00]  But I was like  Fuck Piers Morgan  If I was CNN  I'd move her over today  Yeah  Today  Because she got me watching  I don't even know what she discussed  And who cared  Right  I know I saw Jane Fonda  And I know I saw the guy  That used to be on  Sex and the City  This is what I could tell you  About the  I don't know what either one talked about  Yeah  And I'm not fucking trying to make a bit here  I was just staring at her for an hour  Yeah  She's a  She's a looker with some 
[02:03:30]  Giant tits  And then I did some research  And she was voted like one of the top ten  Beautiful  Journalists that we have out there  Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  There were a few on the list  That were a little  You know  Probably should have been on the list  Megyn Kelly  Megyn Kelly I believe made the list  Mm-hmm  That  Erin Burnett made the list  Who else  About the one from right there  Which one now  Fox Business  No  Fox Business News  No she didn't make it  She's fucking 
[02:04:00]  And she's hotter than some of the ones  They had on the list  She's pretty hot  What about Jill Nicolini  Did she  Jill did not make it  Jill  Did not make it  Mike Francesa  So then he got hit with another call yesterday  Oh boy  Two yesterday alone  And this one is really good  And I'll explain why in a second  Francis and Astoria  What's up Francis  Hey Mike  First time in a long time  Good what's up  Just wanted to let you know  We're going to be getting some snow  Later this afternoon  So no naps huh  Let's go  You got something important to say

[02:05:30]  So he should  He should embrace that shit  And have a little fun with it  Fuck it  And then they'll actually go away  He gets so annoyed  Because now everyone's all in  Because there's been two days in a row  In the paper  Where they're talking about him  And his prank calls  So you know  He's gonna just get more and more now  Now he's gonna get more  And more people are gonna  Hear that  Right  And pile on  And see how annoyed he gets  Right  He's absolutely annoyed by all this  Yeah  I love it  If the people are listening  That listens to that show

[02:07:30]  Yeah  And they  They  They  They vote on the blonde curve  Not only that  You know what it is?  It's her personality also  I think goes a long way  She kind of makes jokes  And stuff  When she's doing the news  Alright, but I think  They're going for just hot  Not personality  Yeah  Which could be  You know, could make a girl hot  Personal  Uh, yeah  She makes all these lists  And I don't  I just don't see it with her  No, I think there's a lot more  Bombshell-y girls out there than her  But she does alright  This is another list, by the way

[02:18:30]  I didn't know you were a lesbian  How does Cynthia Nixon's pussy taste?  AIDS  AIDS  Oh, my God  That is more of a man  Oh, wow  Than all of us  Yep  So I would say  Officially  She's not a lesbian  She just doesn't get the pipe in her 
[02:19:00]  Right  She doesn't like the dick  She likes everything about a man  Except that pesky dick  That's a man  That's a man  And she goes through life  Dressing like a man  Yes  So then  How are they lesbians?  I don't understand  This fucking world  I get confused  Cynthia Nixon was in  What?  Little Darlings?  Was that the one?  But can I ask you something?  If you were  If you were a chick, right?  Yeah  And you're like  You know what?  I'm a lesbian  I'm a lesbian  Wouldn't you go for the hottest piece of ass looking girl out there? 
[02:19:30]  You'd think  Why would you go  Alright, I'm a lesbian  But I need a girl that looks like a dude  I think the hottest piece of ass is they're going for the dick  Very hard to get one if she's a lesbo  I think there's gotta be a few out there  She's a lesbian  They're scooped up by celebrity lesbians  Oh  Cause then she's got a  She's basically got a guy  But she's a lesbian  A dickless man  A dickless man  Yeah  Like I don't get it  Like if I was a lesbian  I would go for like as they say the lipstick kind  Yeah  Right?

[02:20:00]  Yeah  Lipstick  Oh god  You wouldn't have to have big boobs, right?  I would go for Richard Simmons if I was a lesbian  Richard Simmons  He looks like  His fucking head  He looks like an aging orangutan  I'm starting to learn how to say that word properly  Orangutan  I used to say orangutan  Let's see what he says  What is it?  Vegetables, dairy, fat, protein, and starch  There's nothing other than that  I know that you need some of it in the right portions 
[02:20:30]  Unless you're a diabetic with the sugars  But basically it's portions of food  It's so distracting  And today people starve  Are they eating one meal a day?  Is that some spray on in there?  They drink the liquid shakes and all of that  But with my program it is just  He looks like shit  He should not be giving any health tips anymore  Oh shut up Soledad  You don't like Soledad  I like when Soledad talks about black issues 
[02:21:00]  She is so white  And why are we a beast nation?  Because we have low self-worth  Oh is he crying?  What?  20 years ago  A teacher could have said something to you  Or your grandmother said you're not pretty enough  Or somebody at work made fun of you  He's crying  He's crying  And it's like a reel in your head  And those words keep going over and over  How much dick  And then you don't believe in yourself  Did he take in his asshole  To make him cry at the drop of a hat  And then you take food and stuff it down 
[02:21:30]  To hide your emotions  Why is it so personally moving to you?  I mean you know  You're crying practically  Because that's what he does  I know  You're a success  It's not about me  I call and email thousands of people every week  Even if I've known them 20 years  And they're not doing well  I always think that maybe  After a phone call  When I sing them a song  What's he crying about? 
[02:22:00]  What are you crying about?  Turn it around  Really?  I took it person  I wish I had to  That's terrific  It's just like  That's terrific  I see my head  On their bodies  Huh?  And I suffer their pain  Not acknowledging that he's wearing a ridiculous tank top and shorts combo  I know  You can act like a man  What's the matter with you?  Psychological dilemma  Because they're going to see real people that have lost weight  People come in all shapes and sizes  And there's no scales at the gates of heaven  Wearing a bedazzled tank top  Yeah your shape is shit 
[02:22:30]  There's no scales at the gates of heaven  How does he know?  It's about being a good example to your children  We have obese children  We have obese teens  He's wearing lipstick  Some commit suicide  I can't get over the hair  You could see how he would look if he like  Just had a little bit of hair  Right  Underneath  Like picture him without the wispy fucking dandelion shit  Like you could see what he'd look like with regular hair  Because it's  I think he's using that spray shit  He looks horrendous  Really bad  Time to get rid of the tank top at least 
[02:23:00]  Oof  And wear pants  It's a bedazzled tank top  Terrible  Oh Jesus  Oh man  Alright  Where are we on the nympho list?  So now we're up to  What's her name?

[02:27:30]  He was encouraging the fans  All night to interact  Do you  I'm guessing that  That you're not going to  Go along with that  Idea either  If fans interact  That's because LL can beat up  The internet  Yeah  That's why  That's why  Right  I wouldn't encourage  Going back and forth  With fans  I would say 13% of people  On the internet are cool  The rest of them  They're just a bunch of animals  Why would you want to  Why would you want to talk to them  Wait you're saying  Only 13% of people are  Are cool  13% are cool  The other 87%  Are writing horrific stuff  Under YouTube videos

[02:30:00]  Out!  What happened?  How do you do this? How do you do this?  What happened?  How do you do this?  Yes!  Fuck!  I don't know what happened.  Fuck! I can't!  The headphone is stuck on your thumb?  Yeah, but how do you undo it?  Oh, fuck!  I don't know what happened.  That's never happened to you?  Never.  But then you don't know how to get it out.  I don't know how that happened. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know how that happened either, but then it's not logical where you just do that to get yourself unpinched.  Unpinched in my headphones.  Did I sound like a pussy there?  No.  That fucking hurt a lot.  You sure?  Harlem Shuffle because of Harlem Shake, I'm thinking, E-Rock.  You're a fucking bright man.  All right.  I was being very sarcastic.  Oh.  Jesus, Sam.  Thank you.  Oh.  I liked this song when it came out. 
[02:31:00]  Did you?  Yeah.  This was pretty good.  I wish you had played the Harlem Shuffle coming back.  I mean.  This is the Harlem Shuffle.  You mean Harlem Shake?  Oh, yeah.  The Harlem Shake.  That time.  Ah.  Now, this is a new song.  Brand new, right?  We're on this one.  Harlem Shake?  Harlem Shake, you're still cool.  It's not like...  Well, this is our Gangnam Style.  We did Gangnam Style.  We were right there when that song broke.  That couldn't be less true.  How late were we on that one?  I mean, months. 
[02:31:30]  No.  Yeah.  Impossible.  No, you were really late to Gangnam Style.  No, man.  We know our pop culture.  Like, when you started saying, look at this new song, Gangnam Style, I was like, who invited  the dads?  You know what I mean?  It was done.  Oh, man.  No, that's you trying to fucking beat us up a little bit.  A little bit.  Taking a little shot.  We still have our edge when it comes to pop culture.  Oh, boy.  We're always right there, man.  Usually.  Right there.  Usually.  Right there.  Not always.  Usually.  Fully involved.  Give me one pop culture question. 
[02:32:00]  Who thinks Michael McDonald is still relevant?  Nice.  See?  Now you're talking.  Yeah.  Which one do you want to play today?  No, I don't want to play any one.  What?  We already went over this.  It wasn't for me.  I don't think we went through his whole catalog, though.  Look, no one said Michael McDonald was relevant.  We were goofing on the way he sang, and the fact that his hair looks like he fucking saw  the burning bush is nothing to do with relevancy.  Would you rather have his hair or Richard Simmons' hair?  Yeah, well, Michael McDonald has a great head of hair. 
[02:32:30]  It's just stark white.  It's like fucking Gandalf.  There was a few years there.  He could have just dyed it, and no one would have known the difference.  Exactly.  It's when you get a little too old, and you still dye it when people go, what the fuck's  going on?  But the thing is, he went that salt and pepper route for a while, and if you don't start  dyeing in that period, you can't go fully gray, and then all of a sudden you're like,  hey, how you doing?  Do the ladies love the salt and pepper look?  I think so.  I think there's some fucking...  Why is that?  It shows a little life experience.  Oh. 
[02:33:00]  It's distinguished.  That's what the hair dye commercials go.  I don't want to get rid of all my gray.  It shows I have some experience, but I'm still young enough to have a good time.  But it also shows ladies that your cock just doesn't get as hard as it used to.  It's not as turgid.  Turgid!  Why would you put that message out to the ladies?  Ladies?  Ladies, I got salt and pepper hair, which means I don't get as turgid as I used to.  It's not quite a hard on.  My dick swings about like an airport windsock. 
[02:33:30]  But I'm going to run in the rain, because that's what Cialis makes you do.  I'm going to run in the rain and then canoodle with my woman on a fucking hammock.  Yeah.  Why would you be canoodling on a hammock if you got a turgid fucking rod because of Cialis?  I wouldn't be the fuck the commercial's for.  Which one is it for?  I don't even know.  You'd be in there fucking, fucking.  You know who had the salt and pepper look and looked pretty good with it?  Huh?  Tom Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt went the salt and pepper route for a while, I think in Alien. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  He had the salt and pepper hair, and now it's like all gray.  Well, the thing about salt and pepper is it gets dangerous, because in Alien, I don't know  if you ever noticed this.  He looked pretty young in Alien, but not as young as he did.  But that's what I'm saying.  He looked young, but he wasn't young.  That's just it.  And then it was just a few years later, you looked and went, he got old.  That's the bad thing about looking young when you're old, is that you just take a few more  years added to it, and then you're like, wow, he's really old. 
[02:34:30]  Who did that happen with?  Tom Skerritt.  Oh.  He was fucking like, he looked young.  Pop culture shit.  Perfect.  Tom Skerritt is pop culture shit.  When I think pop culture, man, I think Tom Skerritt.  All right.  Let's.  Yeah.  You know what?  I was grabbing a beer from my bar, which was down in my basement the other night.  And as I'm passing by the movie posters, I look at the Alien movie poster I have, and  my eyes went right to Tom Skerritt's name.  Really?  And I actually gave a chuckle. 
[02:35:00]  I was chuckling to myself.  How boss would it be to get it signed?  Dude.  By Tom Skerritt.  I would fucking love to get my Alien poster signed by Tom Skerritt and Sigourney Weaver  and the guy that plays The Hobbit in Lord of the Rings.  Elijah Wood?  No.  I have his on the Lord of the Rings poster.  Oh.  No.  The other guy.  Fucking.  What's his name?  That English guy.  That came in here?  Gandalf the Great?  No.  William Hurt, I would like. 
[02:35:30]  Or John Hurt.  Which one is it?  No.  The other guy.  The guy that was Ash.  Oh.  Bruce Campbell.  Yeah.  He played Bilbo Baggins.  Bruce Campbell.  No.  Yeah.  It was definitely him.  No.  Oh, yeah.  It was from Martin Freeman from The Office?  No.  Ian Holm.  Ian Holm.  Holm.  That would be a good poster.  Yes.  All right.  So let's skip making a Harlem Shake video and go right to the Tom Skerritt video because  that's going to be the next shit.  Tom Skerritt. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, can I?  I got to say something.  The stupid fucking news.  The charred remains of the dude in the cabin is Dorner.  Yeah.  Stop.  This is how conspiracy shit starts.  If that's what you want to believe.  They're on CNN right now.  You don't believe he could have dug a tunnel and that's the body of someone he killed and  left in the cabin?  You want to believe your government? 
[02:36:30]  You go right ahead.  Just laughs it off.  But these conspiracy guys, they go with the news and what they do.  They're not officially saying it's his body now.  Yeah.  I've seen things that'll blow your mind.  Have you?  What?  A man in a feather boa.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  It's called the mirror.  They got Dorner.  Yep.  He's toast, as they say.  Yeah, he's done.  Yeah.  But for some reason, the news will not admit it. 
[02:37:00]  And that's going to get the conspiracy people going nuts.  Going to get his Dentu records?  Yeah, I understand.  They're trying to be a little, you know.  But they can at least tell the news.  Yeah, we got him.  The DNA?  We got him.  We know we got him.  And then officially they go, we got him.  He's a goner.  All right.  Where were we?  Pop culture?  Harlem Shake?  Harlem Shake?  Do I know the Harlem Shake song?  I don't know.  Pump it up.  Pump it up?  And then it kicks in, and then all the people appear. 
[02:37:30]  Watch.  And yeah.  We got to do one of these.  Everyone else is doing one.  Everyone.  Oh, boy.  What do you have to do to get a viral Harlem Shake video?  To make it viral, because believe me, there are plenty of Harlem Shake videos. 
[02:38:00]  I bet a bunch of them have 10 views.  All right.  Now you're talking.  How do we make it?  How do we get 10 views?  We get an iPhone 5, girl.  iPhone 5, girl?  Maybe you'll be in it.  Sure.  I'm doing the Harlem Shake.  It's fun.  Even Ryan Seacrest made one, so I think it's too late.  Yeah, that's usually the end of shit.  And he did one in his radio station.  You see his?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You got to look at Brian Seacrest. 
[02:38:30]  What do you got to do?  Just fucking act like an asshole?  This guy's an amazing broadcaster.  Yeah.  It starts with one guy acting like an asshole, and then when the song kicks in, everybody  acts like an asshole.  Everyone acts like an asshole.  Yes.  It's all about acting like an asshole.  It's not a dance that you have to know any steps to.  No.  Oh, and he got Kendall and Kylie Jenner to do it with him.  Oh, wow.  So there's Ryan Seacrest.  He's behind the board looking at his phone like they're in a break.  One guy's doing the Harlem Shake in the back of the room.  Everyone else is on their phones like they don't know what the fuck's going on. 
[02:39:00]  And then here you go.  The song kicks in, and there's Ryan Seacrest doing his fucking whacked out dance with  everybody else.  I've noticed something else.  Could you pause this or whatever?  What, what, what?  I've noticed something else.  You don't wait until it kicks in and then get up and start going.  They edit the video, it looks like.  It's always a cut.  It's always a cut.  It's all about the cut.  And then they're going crazy.  It's all about the cut.  Yeah, because then there's more fucking people.  Right.  It's not about, you know, standing up.  How does Ryan Seacrest even look lame when he's like... 
[02:39:30]  God, you're so right.  I can't even play this part.  He's the lamest ass ever.  He's supposed to be lame, but he looks lame being lame.  He's not doing it right.  And the fucking guy probably makes a hundred million dollars a year.  He's not cool.  He stinks.  Wow.  Like everybody's like being cool and he's not being cool.  And they all kiss his ass out there in LA.  Yeah.  Show is who gives a fuck.  But the problem is those who gives a fuck shows get syndicated across America. 
[02:40:00]  Easily digestible.  There's nothing going on with his show.  That's what, and he has to make sure it stays that way.  Because the minute something happens...  The minute you get a little edgy, you're fucked.  Nobody can have an actual opinion on it.  No.  That's weird.  I don't know.  That's a strange world to live in.  Because if somebody likes it, that means there's another person who doesn't like it.  And then you're in big trouble.  Yeah.  It's just what?  Background noise?  That's it.  It's just like his New Year's specials.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah.  You got to just be bland. 
[02:40:30]  Any time you got to tell everyone how much fun you're having, that means you're not having fun.  Like a biscuit.  A digestible biscuit.  Not like a dinner biscuit.  Like an English biscuit.  Oh.  Ooh.  All right.  Delicious.  So we've decided not to do our Harlem Shake video.  Yeah.  Is that what we've decided now?  Yeah.  We're done.  Unless we could do what Ant's saying and fucking...  We're good with that twist.  Can we come up with a twist on this one?  What if we get Tom Skerritt to appear in the video?  You know what?  That would be fucking great. 
[02:41:00]  We missed our opportunity yesterday.  Hear me out.  Ant's talking about the twist.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  You got us.  We're hanging out.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, there's the cut.  Like we discussed, you got to go with the cut.  Uh-huh.  And then it goes into that over-the-top ridiculous gay shit we were doing yesterday.  That would have went viral.  How funny would it be?  That would have went...  Can we get everyone back in their places?  Oh, no.  Just for our Harlem Shake video.  No.  There's no more gay.  We got the gay out.  It's illegal now in here.  Yeah, but now we're talking about a viral video. 
[02:41:30]  The law has been passed.  It is now illegal to brandish a penis in this fucking studio.  What if we did a thing where we started it normal, and like one of us was dancing, like  I was dancing.  I think we'd have to have Troy as the first guy dancing.  Okay, so Troy's dancing.  Right.  And you two are just sitting there.  Right.  And then when the video cuts, instead of doing like Harlem Shake stuff, I'll just put in  footage from yesterday of just like guys blowing each other and stuff.  They weren't blowing each other.  Pretty much.  And I swear to you, no one was blowing anyone in the studio yesterday. 
[02:42:00]  It looked like they were.  Like just throw in clips of guys making out.  And everybody's like, what are we watching?  I thought that was Harlem Shake.  I kind of think it would be funny.  But I think we missed our opportunity.  No, I got the video from yesterday.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, we'll put in the clip of like, because we can put in the clip of them making out in  front of his dick.  Everyone will watch it and think we're going to go and start doing it.  And it's just guys making out and naked. 
[02:42:30]  That's what we got to do.  But don't you have to have the same shot the whole time with the cut?  Everybody would think it's the same shot, and then it just wouldn't be.  And they'd be like, what?  Like we got to break the mold on this.  You know what?  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking this could work.  All we got to do is film a beginning.  Do you have a really gay scene without cock?  Because YouTube doesn't accept cock.  It could pixelate.  The two guys making out in front of his dick?  Yeah.  The shot I got, their heads are covering the actual penis. 
[02:43:00]  Would that be a lot on YouTube?  Totally.  You can't see the dick.  I'd cut off the part where you could see the head poking up.  We've decided to, like, kind of bury the footage from yesterday.  Yeah.  But now I'm thinking we might have to do something with it.  I think we got an opportunity to utilize the footage.  Sucking the toes.  I'll dig through shots where you can't see a penis.  Because all you have to do is get up into that upper corner to film the first part of the Harlem Shake video.  Me and Ange is being whatever.  I'll be on my phone eating oatmeal. 
[02:43:30]  And Troy should be in his underwear when he dances, I would think.  And he's dancing in the corner or something.  Right.  And then it's the big cut.  It's just gay shit happening.  Can you show me some footage from yesterday that might work?  I'd have to grab the camera and just show it to you.  No, I'm thinking this might really work.  So after the show.  Yeah.  How many seconds do you need?  Like 15, 20?  Say 20 seconds.  I could farm 20 seconds out of that. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my God.  People would be so pissed.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  We just call it the Opie and Anthony Harlem Shake.  Shake, yeah.  So the people listening to us right now, make believe you're not listening to us.  Or just pass along.  Because we want you to be surprised.  Or you guys pass it along to your friends and be like, oh, Opie and Anthony did a really  funny Harlem Shake.  We've got to do this.  It's so bad.  I think we've got to do this.  Yeah.  I think it's a good idea.  Yeah.  Can we film it tomorrow? 
[02:44:30]  We can film it today.  This will be the first ONA video I will never watch.  Yeah.  Like, we can film it now.  Edit it tonight.  Isn't that technically breaking our no more gay rule?  No.  It's the stuff from yesterday.  It's grandfathered in.  Is that it?  So does Troy have any of his thongs still here?  We have the thongs still here.  Why does he need to be in a thong now? 
[02:45:00]  I guess that's a good point.  Do we do this?  Yeah.  Ant, stop these packets.  Opie and Sam are just gay men.  Why?  No, we're not.  We're not gay.  We're hilarious.  I think this is...  What?  A good idea is a good idea.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  We don't see in terms of sexuality.  We just see good ideas.  You don't think that would be hilarious?  It would be hilarious. 
[02:45:30]  You went with the, we need a twist, so we came up with the twist for you.  That's a twist, all right.  You were the one who said, Harlem Shake with a twist, and then we're like, all right, what's  the twist?  We come up with the twist, now you're bailing on us?  We got all this gay footage from yesterday and nothing to do with it.  You mean happy, fun footage?  I mean gay, homosexual acts.  Oh, I thought you meant old school word, gay.  No, new school.  Very new school.  All right, we'll think about that one.  Because we don't have Kendall and Kylie Jenner.  What do we have?  A bunch of footage of guys naked and making out. 
[02:46:00]  That's right.  So let's utilize what we have, is all I'm saying.  Ryan Seacrest, he's up to 70,000 views, but I think he wanted a lot more considering  he had the Jenner broads in there.  Well, yeah, the last Harlem Shake video we watched had almost 10 million views on it.  Yeah, Ryan really thought he had something because he had the younger pieces of asses  from that family.  Plus, he's Ryan Seacrest.  I call this a bomberoo from Ryan Seacrest.  He's in 200 markets, and that's what he got.  Really?  Yeah.  Plus international. 
[02:46:30]  Do you like Ryan Seacrest, radio guy?  No.  Do you?  You like him, don't you?  He does.  He's got to like anybody that's successful in the business.  Yeah, he likes him.  He's incapable of not adoring those people that have done well in this business.  If we're talking radio, I was thinking something yesterday when I was wandering around trying  to get the filth out of my mind from yesterday's show.  This is just a quick idea.  I want you, Sam Roberts, to surprise me and Anthony one day with a out of the blue. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, thank God.  Jacktober.  Oh, that I can do.  I thought you were going to ask me to quit the show again.  I wouldn't have done it.  People love Jacktober to the point they don't want to wait until October.  So my thing is, one day you just fucking surprise us.  That's fun.  I don't want to know when it's coming.  You figure out when it makes sense and you go, bam, today.  Find an awesome show.  Yes.  And just surprise people with a little quick Jacktober. 
[02:47:30]  Then we can do the whole Facebook thing and have a little fun.  Why wait until October?  You're right.  I do like good Jacktober.  And we'll do it once.  So that, because if you do it once.  No, I don't want it to be a regular feature.  I just want you to just completely surprise us one day and go, today is the day.  One and done.  Because that's the thing about Jacktober is you guys end up getting angry by like the  fourth or fifth day.  We do it once and everybody's still happy and in a good mood.  And then if that works, then maybe surprise us again down the road.  I don't know.  But at least for now, like one day starting, it could be tomorrow. 
[02:48:00]  For all you know, it's a surprise.  You just surprise us with a Jacktober out of the blue.  I'll do it.  All right, good.  I accept the challenge.  And then we lead to our last radio thing.  Ooh.  Fuck yeah, I want that even though it's on demand.  Blu-ray Scottfall.  Thank you.  Yeah, you know what though?  Fuck, my door man's going to love this one.  Oh, jeez.  So I'm on the phone during the extra show.  Sometimes when you get a Blu-ray, it's better to watch it in Blu-ray.  Then to watch it on demand, you know, depending on your cable company and your fucking router 
[02:48:30]  and shit like that, sometimes you don't get that good crisp picture.  But I do think Blu-ray's better.  I don't have a Blu-ray player.  You got PlayStation.  No, that went.  My PS3's done.  What?  And Roland's getting me a fucking plug-ola PS3.  What?  What?  Am I getting a PS3?  And wouldn't that be plug-ola?  No.  Does the opster lie?  I hope he does know how to take advantage of the good old freebies.  A Blu-ray player costs like $70.  I don't give a fuck. 
[02:49:00]  It's fun that you know you're getting it for free.  Brother Weiss taught me.  He taught me well.  Weiss hasn't bought a car in 25 years.  Jesus.  Does that plug-ola?  Every time I go up...  No, he just drives a really old car.  Every time I go up there, he's got a brand new car.  I'm like...  Wow.  I go, how the fuck do I do this?  This seems like the greatest thing ever.  Damn.  And then he trades them in after a few months.  He probably drives three brand new cars a year.  Really?  I think so.  I think they just trade them out every four months.  Four to six months, I think.  Righteous. 
[02:49:30]  All right, so we got the Skyfall 007 Blu-ray.  Thank you.  Nice.  What was the last radio thing you were going to say?  Oh, I was praying that he rocks on the ball today.  Okay, sorry.  And that he was monitoring Scott and Todd.  Mm-hmm.  Because it is Valentine's Day.  We really haven't talked about Valentine's Day.  And we know them.  Can I tell my Valentine's Day story?  The day we drank in Boston?  I love telling the story every year.  That was Valentine's Day, yes. 
[02:50:00]  Me, you, and Jay getting fucking hammered on the side of Route 9, basically.  It was the He-Man Woman's Hater Club that day.  Remember the bar that was pretty much 20 feet from Route 9?  Yeah.  You remember that?  It was between your place and my place on Route 9.  It was snowy, right?  I think so.  A little icy on the ground.  Yeah, I gave my chick at the time.  I figured Valentine's Day, how do you go wrong with a necklace that looks like a heart?  Yeah.  Man, am I stupid.  Oh, boy.  Boy, am I stupid for not knowing what women want for Valentine's Day. 
[02:50:30]  Yep.  She opened it up and started crying.  I'm like, this is beautiful.  She fucking loves it.  She fucking said, it's ugly.  It's ugly.  So then I fucking, I don't remember how it ended, but I left the abode immediately, called  Anthony, and we met at this joint on Route 9 with our old friend Jay, and we drank that  Valentine's Day.  Yes, we did, because we were all fucking pissed off. 
[02:51:00]  Why were you pissed that time?  Please.  You never told me.  I was fucking married to.  Yeah, but how were you able to leave your house to come drink with me on Valentine's  Day?  She was probably passed out somewhere.  It was, it was, I think it was even on a weekend, and it was in the middle of the day.  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  I think it was late morning, to be honest with you, because the day started, I'm like,  Valentine's Day, here you go.  It'll be any hour, any day.  You could probably rest assured I was pissed off at her for being her. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that happened to me twice.  Then it was the Christmas time where, I forgot what bag was popular at the time, but  I got one.  Yeah.  I figured girls like bags.  Wasn't it Gucci or something at the time?  Let's say Gucci.  I don't even know.  I don't even remember anymore, and I handed her her Christmas gifts, and there was a  whole pile with the big fucking gift at the bottom.  Same thing.  She opens it up.  She starts crying. 
[02:52:00]  I'm like, fucking nailed it.  And this was after the Valentine's Day thing.  Jesus.  My first clue should have been Valentine's Day, you know, get the fuck out of this.  Yeah.  Well, I got the fuck out of that relationship four years after the fact.  Four years.  I think so.  Well, he fucking picked up and ran four years later.  But I learned my lesson from the Valentine's Day situation, so I got the bag for Christmas,  and she opened up the bag, fucking crying her eyes out.  I'm like, I finally figured this shit out.  Look at me.  I got it.  They talk about women and how it's a combination. 
[02:52:30]  You got to just figure out the combination, and you're in.  I guess the tortoise won that race.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Four years.  Four years.  And then I started crying, looked at me, and once again, exact same thing.  She goes, it's ugly.  What?  I swear to God.  I swear I'm not lying.  So you didn't figure out.  And so I went, enough of this shit.  Left the house again.  Enough.  Here's the receipt. 
[02:53:00]  Who says it's ugly?  It's a horrible thing.  But there's other ways.  Like, we're all in situations.  Like, anyone in a relationship, you do buy the wrong shit sometimes.  Okay?  Yes.  We're not perfect.  But there's a better way to handle it than crying and saying it's ugly.  You go, oh, nice.  But I was.  Oh, thank you.  There's a way.  You fucking.  Jess, you know what?  It's probably.  I love it.  Look, it's fantastic.  Don't get me wrong.  But it's probably not really going to go with a lot of things that I have.  There you go.  Because you don't know what the fuck girls have or go with. 
[02:53:30]  And you know what that means.  Right.  But at least it's not like it's ugly.  It's ugly.  Right to your fucking face.  Yeah, fuck you.  Jess always.  Well, how about you get a job and buy your own fucking bag?  Ten years with no fucking job and you're going to tell me the bag I bought you's ugly?  Jess will sit there.  Ah, get a job answering phones somewhere.  Do something.  She just pretends to like it when you give it to her.  Right.  And then like two days later she goes, I've been trying this on and I love it, but it 
[02:54:00]  just doesn't fit me right.  Do you have a receipt?  I just don't want to waste the money.  We could probably get something better.  That's a good one.  Okay.  Or sometimes these women are really smart.  They don't even need a fucking receipt.  They go back and they get whatever the fuck they want and then they kind of work it into  your life.  So the thing that you bought just kind of gets left in a pile somewhere?  No.  They bring it back to the store and get the fucking money and then they buy something else  which might even be completely different and then go, you know, I really love the bag  but I have my eye on this dress. 
[02:54:30]  Don't I look good in this dress or whatever?  You know why they don't need a receipt?  They commiserate with the girl behind the counter.  They go, look at what my fucking boyfriend expected me to.  And they're like, oh, God, I know what you mean, sweetie, here.  And then they go, come with me, honey.  They go in the dressing room.  They lezz out for a while.  And then they just bad mouth their boyfriends.  You know what that asshole got me?  And eating each other's pussies.  Oh, jeez.  And then the broad leaves with what she wants.  With what she wants and fucking fishy fingers.  And she comes back home to you so you could pay the rent. 
[02:55:00]  Fucking bitches.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, Valentine's Day.  Right around the corner.  And if you, oh, sorry, reflex.  I hope everyone's happy with the shit they bought.  I know a lot of people did buy the shit we were promoting and pushing.  So I hope you're all happy.  Yeah, damn it.  Yurok, did you find a Valentine's Day song from Scott and Todd? 
[02:55:30]  Please, please, please, please.  No.  Yes, of course I did.  Yay!  Nice.  Fatso!  Why would you say it?  Play this!  Why would you go and say Fatso?  He did a good job.  That was endearing, though.  He had to ruin the applause by yelling Fatso obnoxiously.  No, I said it in a nice way, though.  Does Yurok feelings hurt?  A little.  Yeah.  They're dampened.  Slobo! 
[02:56:00]  Yurok comment.  Yurok comment.  No, that's another stupid thing.  Wait, what's that?  Slobo's got an opinion.  Sad Iraq comment.  Because he's all sad that you called him that.  What?  I'm going to get even more on Twitter from this, but I don't care.  Your Iraq comment thing makes sense when you do it.  Oh, no.  Oh, he's got a comment.  But the slightest thing comes up, even if I have no association to what it is, but they're  talking to you, they reply to me and they go, Iraq comment.  Iraq comment!  It's like gun issues and other stuff. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, I have nothing to do with this.  That shit's funny, though.  Just had to get an Iraq comment.  Why not?  Right.  Funny to me if I got those tweets out.  Iraq comment.  Mopi!  Mopi.  Oh, God.  Slobo is still in the house.  Slobo?  Slobo!  Slobo in the house.  That's so insulting.  Why?  Shout outs rule.  I'm going to do a shout out viral video.  Shout out.  Oh, yeah.  I'm working it out in my head. 
[02:57:00]  Slobo!  That's right.  It's going to be a fucking viral video, I'm telling you.  It's not going to go viral if you say it goes viral.  I know.  True.  You can't plan a viral video.  Trust me.  Yeah, it hurts a little.  Slobo laughing.  See, that's not necessary either.  Sorry.  It hurts a little.  So, we got a parody song from Scott and Todd?  Of course we do. 
[02:57:30]  Okay.  And it's a theme for Valentine's Day.  Oh, by the way, I just checked my Twitter for the first time in three minutes.  And people love the Harlem Shake video idea, Anthony.  Are you in or not?  Harlem Shake video with the gay scene from, I don't know.  I don't think Ant's in.  He was so out.  Yes, I've never seen Ant so out as he was yesterday.  I was completely out of that mix yesterday.  That was weird.  Oh, I wanted to dive right in.  Ant's an in kind of guy. 
[02:58:00]  I'm in.  Right?  Very rarely are you out.  I was done.  I was fucking done.  I was so out.  Yeah.  I rarely promote, you know, the show as we're still doing the show.  But make sure you listen to the first hour of the show today if you're just tuning in now.  Yeah, it's a little recap of what happened yesterday, the after effects thereof.  Yeah, we break down the gay off.  Yeah, yeah.  We break it down.  We tell you about the...  No one said goodbye to anyone yesterday.  We all just left.  Yeah.  We just all kind of left and went in our own... 
[02:58:30]  Tell you about the collateral damage, the fucking radiation poisoning from the people  that were in the blast radius.  Yeah, so the first hour we break it down for...  Excuse me, everybody.  Break it down.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So what's the Scott and Todd song?  Yeah, let's hear it.  It's a song for Valentine's Day.  Oh, my God.  Valentine, won't you be mine?  I was in prison, but right now I'm fine. 
[02:59:00]  The tumor that I had inside my head luckily was denied.  What?  Valentine, give me a sign.  I'll buy you flowers and a box of wine.  Don't make me lock you in my basement and tie you up with twine.  My psychiatrist says it's unlikely I will kill again.  What?  I can be your guy.  Just give me a try. 
[02:59:30]  My panic attack is controlled with Prozac, so don't run.  A Prozac.  Don't run.  Cause I'll find you if you move.  Don't move.  I'm not crazy, but I'll buy a tracking device and put it on your car.  And you will not get very far, so don't run.  Don't run.  Cause I'll find you if you move.  Don't move.  I'm not crazy, but I'll hang from your axle like the Nero in Cape Fear.  Oh, my God.  Cause I love you, my dear. 
[03:00:00]  That was some shoehorning right there.  What is this supposed to be?  Is this just a generic stalker?  I don't know what it's about.  It's supposed to be a psycho trying to celebrate Valentine's Day.  Right.  It's not a specific person, though, right?  How many years ago do you think he actually made this?  Oh, this is fucking years, I bet.  The shoehorning is astounding. 
[03:00:30]  It probably came out when this song was popular.  It's probably when he made this.  The only reason is if it didn't make any sense.  Yeah.  How much longer?  20 seconds.  Oh, God.  A tracking device.  A device.  What kind of device do you have?  Oh, my God.  Cause I'll find you if you move. 
[03:01:00]  Don't move.  I'm not crazy.  I'll hang on your axle like the Nero in Cape Fear.  Because I love you, my dear.  Happy Valentine's!  Wow.  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  It's no Weird Al, right, Iraq?  No, not at all.  Oh, man.  Does Weird Al have a Valentine's song?  No, not that I...  What about John Valby? 
[03:01:30]  I don't know if Valby does.  Let me see.  You could do gonorrhea for Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  There's a good gonorrhea song.  Mm-hmm.  That was bad.  Huh?  That was bad.  Yeah, man.  Just sucked.  It was not topical.  It was a song from, what, 12 years ago?  What song is it done for?  She Bangs.  Oh, that's She Bangs?  Yeah.  Oh.  I know She Bangs.  It's longer than 12 years ago, I think. 
[03:02:00]  More, probably, right?  Really?  Yeah.  Why would you put that on the radio?  That was on today?  That was this morning, yeah.  That's horrible.  Yeah, it really is.  Let's put everybody...  Oh, this guy's been trying to push this Mike Francesa Valentine's Day thing.  Hold on a minute.  Can I play it from my phone?  It's my favorite.  Please.  Let me see.  Please do.  For real?  All right.  You asked for it.  I mean, I could... 
[03:02:30]  Now listen.  Valentine's Day, you know...  You could just send it to me.  I'd be happy to help.  You know what?  It's inching closer by the day, and the word is big.  Big, big, big.  How about when the princess went through that...  I must say, not to get...  All right.  Without this, but how about when the princess went through the ritual, okay?  Well, you know...  I mean, I mean...  I mean...  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:00]  I couldn't even think of that, no less.  Watch it.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Ugh!  Oh.  I don't even want to say what happened.  It's not sexual.  So that's not the point.  It's just disgusting to watch.  It wasn't sexual in nature.  But it was...  My point is, it was...  We all thought about having sex with Mickey Mouse.  He then had sex with me, and then left without saying anything. 
[03:03:30]  I said, no, we can't do this.  This is not right.  And then he had sex with me, and then he left without saying anything.  What she felt were some wounds in her private areas.  There was no semen.  What we're hearing is that, you know, the...  Pam took her to the room, and we don't know what happened there.  But I don't know if he told them that he had sex with her or not.  There is a report out on TNP that a condom was... 
[03:04:00]  A used condom was recovered from the room, okay?  He gave it to me for nine innings.  I'm telling you, up one side, down the other side.  For nine innings, he gave it to me.  I took it, he gave it to me for nine innings.  That night, he rode me, he gave...  Oh, man, he let me have it for the whole game.  The whole game.  I got it a lot of times that...  A couple of weeks there, where I went places, I got it where... 
[03:04:30]  I got it in a restaurant.  It happens.  But I'm telling you, nine innings, this guy.  And he was like, not more than two zeros behind me.  He rode me the whole game.  Is it working?  Because it goes on forever.  Went to a great length of work there.  Yes.  I'd say we go home.  I'd say we do, too.  It's Valentine's Day.  Let's do it.  Yeah, we're going to go home.  Sam, is that all right with you?  Did an hour of Radio Extra yesterday. 
[03:05:00]  Cocksucker.  We're doing live reads now.  There's one.  Something about Anthony Jeselnik, right?  Is this the last one?  Oh, yeah.  From Comedy Central, stand-up, and his blistering appearance on the Comedy Central roast of Charlie  Sheen and Donald Trump.  Now he's bringing his signature dark and twisted point of view to an all-new Comedy Central series,  The Jeselnik Offensive.  Airing Tuesdays at 10.30 p.m., 9.30 Central on Comedy Central every Tuesday.  Jeselnik will unleash the razor-sharp take on the latest must-see news ripped straight  from the headlines of the places we all troll for the darker and more shocking and lurid 
[03:05:30]  stories.  Two panelists will join Jeselnik to further bash pop culture and gleefully rip the veil  of sanctity from off-limits topics, Life is Cruel, So Is He, to Jeselnik Offensive,  Tuesdays at 10.30 p.m., 9.30 Central, after an all-new Tosh.0 on Comedy Central.  You know, we haven't done it all week.  What?  What happened?  Line of the day is feeling very...  Do we have line of the day today? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  I mean...  Did you work on lines?  It's a hilarious show, so...  I don't want to force it.  Do you have them or not?  If you don't have them, say you don't have them.  I have a winner, but I don't have some...  All right.  We could just do a quick winner.  Kenny's in studio, though.  Kenny?  G.H., may I remind people of something?  I guess.  I want to see all my friends Sunday night at the Bregada in Atlantic City.  Oh, right.  So, all my friends, please come to the Bregada Sunday night, and let's celebrate President's 
[03:06:30]  Weekend.  And then...  Is there tickets available for the Late Show?  Oh, yes.  Late Show.  Thank you, G.H., for mentioning that.  I was just, you know, wanting to hang out with my friends.  Sure.  But you might as well come see a show, 10.30, tickets on sale now, Bregada.com.  Who's there?  Jimmy?  Artie?  The Anti-Social Comedy Tour, yes.  With who and who and who and who and who and who.  Amy Schumer, Dave Attell, Artie Lang, and hosted by Jim Norton. 
[03:07:00]  That's a fucking show and a half right there.  I'll say it is, G.H.  I'm going.  You probably could make a viral video there.  I'm hoping.  I'm hoping.  And then next weekend, I want to see all my friends in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Why do you say Loss?  Friday and Saturday night.  Why do you say Loss?  Loss.  No, most people just say Vegas, but I say Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  I think they know if you just say Vegas, which Vegas you're talking about.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  No, Las Vegas.  Yeah.  I'm formal.  Are you?  Yeah, but Friday and Saturday night, MGM Hotel, the Hollywood Theater, Jim Norton, and Dave Attell.  I like the MGM Theater.  They still got the lines.  Yeah, that's their theme.  That's their logo.  That's their thing, right?  Yeah.  But they still have the actual lines still.  Yeah, MGM's cool.  It really is cool.  Yeah, Hollywood Theater next Friday and Saturday night, a Comedy Central event.  Every word out of his mouth is one second I'm going to be delayed getting into bed and going back to sleep. 
[03:08:00]  Well, let's do this then.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I'm teasing him.  I'm just, you know, I care about my friends.  I want to see them in Orange City Sunday and Vegas next Friday and Saturday.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  Good night.  I have a weird plug.  Whoa.  Yeah.  What is it, G.H.?  Slavo.  I've been approached to do an elevator show.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding. 
[03:08:30]  An elevator show.  Yeah.  I guess my elevator videos have gotten the attention of this place.  Oh, so you just do a show from the elevator.  Yeah.  So I think Opie's elevator show is going to be starting soon.  It all depends, man.  Sometimes it's a quick elevator trip.  Sometimes, you know, a lot of people get on.  I'm not even joking.  Oh.  Is this where is it?  NBC Thursday night?  Well, no, no.  It's just going to be like a little web series.  Web-isodes. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Web-isodes.  I'm moving into the web-isode genre.  Web-isodes are the new episodes.  Are they?  Yeah.  I'm hoping.  Yeah.  I'm sure it'll be terrific, GH.  So whoever wants to, you know, be part of my elevator show.  I'm looking for ideas.  I'll push some buttons.  You want to push some buttons?  Yeah.  I'll have more details soon because I don't even know if these people are joking with me or not.  They really like my elevator videos out of all the videos I've made.  Yeah.  Mask Sexual Flavors is the new way to foreplay. 
[03:09:30]  Available in four tantalizing flavors.  These oral gel strips will be the spark to light your bedroom flame.  Visit sexualflavors.com to purchase or find a retailer near you.  And, of course, they sponsor Line of the Day, and we're going to go right to Line of the Day so we can get the fuck out of here.  Right?  All right.  Yeah.  Here comes.  Line of the Day.  Better be slobbo.  Line of the Day.  Better be slobbo.  Come on, slobbo. 
[03:10:00]  Ant, stop these packets.  Opie and Sam are just gay men.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  That was vindictive.  That was vindictive.  That was nothing but a vengeful.  You didn't try today.  Yeah.  You didn't try today.  He's using the power of his office for his own means.  Yeah, he is.  And that is not working for the people.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Absolutely.  You're right.  That's something I learned today from E-Rock.  All right.  Roland, why are you in here?  What are you promoting?  Who are you trying to put?  You like the slobbo thing?  Roland loves making fun of E-Rock for being fat.  It doesn't make sense.  It just doesn't make sense.  How does that make sense?  It doesn't.  Okay.  And how does E-Rock not have a comeback?  I don't know why he never has a comeback.  E-Rock, why don't you have a comeback when it's a very easy thing to do in some cases? 
[03:11:00]  Really?  Roland gets very mean.  Yeah, he does.  Roland already tweeted about slobbo.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Roland has intimidated E-Rock.  He has, right, E-Rock?  Into the position where you don't want to take on Roland because Roland doesn't have a line.  Like, you can go, okay, I'll just bash Roland a little bit, but Roland will then turn around and fucking just rip your heart out.  So you've got to be careful with Roland. 
[03:11:30]  One of my favorites was the Master Poe.  That was perfect.  Perfect example, by the way, of just such a thing.  It was just fun and light, and it turned to the how's your dead dog?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Ah, Roland.  All right, we're going to go home now.  Yeah.  We're going to go home now.  Yeah.  What, Roland?  Lovoo!  Why do you have the Great Bambino on your t-shirt?  I don't know.  Are you a Great Bambino?  The Sultan of Swat?  The Sultan of Swat. 
[03:12:00]  The Colossus of Clout?  The Colossus of Clout.  The Great Bambino.  Oh, the Great Bambino.  That was a great movie.  That was fun.  I was just like that guy with the fish hat.  Yes.  See you all tomorrow.  I like that.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Oh, yeah.  Roland has two emotions.  Just to touch him the same way his brother did.  How's your dog?  Wow.  Is it still dead? 
[03:12:30]  What the fuck?  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Oh, my God.  This guy should be in a movie.  My condolences.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live with the primetime kid on show, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, dig it. 
[03:13:00]  That's right.  After Opie and Anthony Live, Macho Man Randy Savage is a listener.  Lots of listeners.  Lots of people listening to this show.  Call up if you learned something.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Phone, slobo.  I'll tell you.  Wow.  E-Rock.  Sal just quietly said off mic, get on the phone, slobo.  I learned something today.  I got to tell you this, Roland. 
[03:13:30]  I learned.  How can any show be a bad show when it ends with Sandlot references?  I loved it.  The Ray Gambino.  When you do a whole scene from the Sandlot.  What did you learn today, Rolandos?  If you call Eric slobo.  Well, five minutes later, he'll come in the studio and pour water on you.  Roland, you are all wet as I look at you right now.  That's how I learned today.  Your head's wet.  You're wearing a gray t-shirt.  It's soaked.  Yes.  Why are you wet? 
[03:14:00]  You don't call Eric slobo because he'll pour water on you.  What happened, Eric?  He called you slobo when you poured water on him?  Yeah.  He had water in his hand, so I just kind of squeezed the bottle that was in his hand.  It shot up like a fountain and dropped right down on top of his head.  You think that's funny?  I just saw the intern had to wipe up the table.  Is he wiping water off the table from when all over you?  Yeah, I'm all over.  Yeah, everything wet.  So how do you go through the rest of the day now soaking wet?  I just pretend it's not there and people just stare at you.  I go, hey, what's up? 
[03:14:30]  I'm like, are you wet now?  You act like nothing's happened.  Remember that one day we got soaked?  And people, well, I guess it's because people already assume that you're out of your mind.  Yeah.  So it just kind of goes, oh, there's Roland.  There's quirky Roland again.  Now he's soaking wet at work.  I always go, is it me or is it really hot in here?  And people are like, oh my God, he's sweaty.  What do people think of this staff?  Like, Roland's walking up and down the hallways soaking wet.  Sal is walking around here with horrible bronzer on today.  Clammy Sal.  What do people think of this staff around here? 
[03:15:00]  We're assholes.  I have a giant afro, but that's the least of our concerns.  The sounds that come out of me, Eric, and Roland's office must scare the shit out of everyone.  Well, I hear some of them because Travis and I sit in one office and then Roland, Sal, and Eric sit in another office.  Our office is nuts.  And every now and then I'll just hear Roland scream.  Or I'll be way up the hall, like talking to like Nicole or somebody in the morning mashup office.  And their office, it's a long hallway. 
[03:15:30]  That's a quarter of a New York City block away.  Yeah, and their office is about a quarter of a block away.  And I'll literally step outside of that office and I'll hear, shut up, shut up.  And Roland's yelling at somebody for some reason.  What Roland likes to do is if people are having a conversation that we can hear in our office, but they're walking down the hallway.  The second they walk past our door, Roland either goes, shh.  Or he'll go, shut up, no one cares.  And these people are discussing like channel changes and programming. 
[03:16:00]  Enough of their fooleries.  It's not enough of their fooleries?  Yes.  And then sometimes it's quiet in our office and that drives Roland nuts.  So he'll grab something and he'll either throw it as hard as he can into the window or out the door hoping that maybe it hits somebody.  Has that ever gotten you into like trouble?  Do you notice who you're yelling at?  Don't, don't, wouldn't management hear you at times?  He doesn't look up.  There have been some close calls.  There have been, Sam.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because you see it happen.  Like, wouldn't management, like, wouldn't our bosses, bosses, bosses be aware? 
[03:16:30]  Because like I said, when I come out of the morning mashups office and I can hear Roland,  the morning mashups office is closer to, you know, our senior vice president's office than it is to the Opie and Anthony office,  meaning that there are probably times when the boss of everything around here,  the guy that Opie and Anthony are supposed to, anyway, answer to, can hear Roland screaming in his office. 
[03:17:00]  About my defense, Eric hits me and I go, ah!  Eric probably has really good reason to hit you.  Oh, no, I didn't say that, though, but when he does, I scream.  And when you say hit, do you mean tap?  Well, it's just like a tap on the arm, but I just make it seem like it's worse.  Right.  He screamed rape a couple times.  You sit in your office screaming rape?  Well, someone, nobody was there to help me, so.  Were you getting raped?  No.  Okay, then that's why.  Nobody was there to help me.  Oh, so you're saying if there was a potential rape, nobody would have been there to save you? 
[03:17:30]  I'm just saying testing out the waters.  I understand.  Man, Roland goes up and down the hallway, just random people that are working in their  area on music stuff, and just puts a box over their head.  That happened to me last week, twice.  Roland's prank.  I've seen him do it, too.  He does it to random people, not just us?  Yeah.  He'll just go up and down the hallway, just something, like, there'll be, like, people  from other channels or interns from other channels.  So Roland will get a big cardboard box.  You've been boxed. 
[03:18:00]  And he'll put it over people's head and shout.  What will you shout at them?  You've been boxed.  You've been boxed.  And then he points and laughs really loud so it draws attention to the person he did it to.  Do you understand that other people have to work here?  Like, the people here actually do work.  I work.  I know, but what you do is you spend a little bit of time and you book some people.  Most of your job is schmoozing.  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of your job will happen after hours.  So you'll go out on a Friday drinking with publicists or whatever.  Yeah.  And you'll be working then. 
[03:18:30]  Which means that during the day, a lot of your time is what I would consider...  My playground.  Down time.  Yeah.  Your playground.  And while everybody else is trying to get work done, you're driving them insane.  I don't understand how you can get away with this bullshit that you do.  I don't know.  You put cardboard boxes on employees' heads.  And these are not...  This isn't like crazy radio land.  Sirius XM is not terribly dissimilar.  At least parts of it are not terribly dissimilar from a regular working environment where there are cubicles. 
[03:19:00]  Spot where you work.  If you're at your desk right now and you're listening to this on headphones at your work computer,  there are lots of people around here who do the same thing.  That's just water because Roland had water sprayed all over his head.  That's why he's soaking wet.  I don't know if that was from yesterday still.  See, Roland is soaking wet sitting next to you and you just took it for granted.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because that's how Roland set it up.  He walks around soaked all the time.  Now, so imagine being in your cubicle and some employee consistently coming up to you 
[03:19:30]  and just putting a box on your head.  How could anybody get away with it?  Because I just do it like once every few months.  That's too many times.  No, it's not.  And you don't do it once every few months.  You do it one day every few months to several people.  When I have a good box.  When you have a good box.  Was it this meeting or last meeting?  I think it was last week's meeting.  Roland was pissed off about something.  And he just blurted out something and took his club soda and poured it on his face.  And he goes,  At a meeting? 
[03:20:00]  At a meeting.  Why do you pour things on yourself?  You have to have a way better system for your energy.  You're like a five-year-old who just, a three-year-old, not quite a five-year-old,  a three-year-old who has all his energy because he just ate nine ice pops  and just has no fucking idea what to do with it.  So he's running around the house and throwing things.  So what's your suggestion?  I mean, I don't, what's my suggestion?  I mean, if you could, I don't know, find a hobby. 
[03:20:30]  Maybe join the gym.  There's a gym in this building.  Slobo!  You're right.  It was a stupid suggestion.  Kenny in Jersey.  It's actually Vinny, the phone screener, fucked up.  He sucks.  Yeah, Macho Man Randy Savage has been dead for a year, just so you know, Sam.  He does not listen to your show.  You're fucking kidding me.  Then how do we have that drop?  Eric?  Didn't you start the show with?  I did.  Yeah.  That I did.  It was with Macho Man.  Okay, well, I mean, I have Macho Man saying he listens to the show, 
[03:21:00]  so Kenny, I think you may be mistaken on that one.  I mean, Troy, you heard the opening of the show, right?  I did, yeah.  Who was it?  Macho Man.  Okay, cool.  So I think Kenny might be a little, his facts might be a little out of order.  Do you want to hear it again as proof?  Yeah, real quick.  All right, here it is.  Yeah, you're listening to After Opiate Anthony Live with the primetime kid himself, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, dig it.  All right, so I mean, Macho Man is obviously alive and well.  Isn't that apparent to you? 
[03:21:30]  Kenny Stone.  Maybe that's what it is.  Larry in Texas.  Hollywood primetime, Sammy Sweetheart, the effin' Roberts.  That's right.  You're such an old broadcaster.  That's my name.  Don't wear it out.  Well, I can't help it.  I can't help it wear it out.  Your greatness.  Thanks.  Well, it never wears out.  It never gets tired.  Your greatness continues to shine.  Thank you.  It never gets old.  It never gets lame.  It never gets stale.  Because you are the man, the myth, the legend. 
[03:22:00]  Correct.  But the most important thing I learned from today's show, and I relearn it from every show,  is how difficult it is for you to drag these hammers to the finish line every day.  Well, you know what?  I've got to tell you, Larry.  You know how I know that Opie had a busy show today?  That Opie was on top of his shit and enjoying himself?  No, I don't know how.  There are only, he left his Sudoku puzzle here at his console, and there are only six  boxes full today.  Sometimes he's able to complete the whole Sudoku, but today, he was only able to complete six 
[03:22:30]  of the Sudoku boxes, which means he was in this thing today.  Well, maybe or that, or he's dumber than a box of rocks, has the ability of a small appliance,  and he couldn't figure it out.  No, I don't think that's the case, but I appreciate your call, Larry.  Well, Sammy, you the man, buddy.  You the man.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Yeah.  Only six boxes completed.  You know, he does Sudoku every day.  He keeps his brain sharp, but...  It's so funny that they all play on their phones, all the shows going on.  No, not even on the phone. 
[03:23:00]  Opie leaves the newspaper out.  No, I know, but like, Jim does chess, plays chess on the phone.  That's right.  And you can always tell how much of your game has been completed is how much were you in  on the show.  Opie was all over this motherfucker today.  Six boxes of the whole puzzle completed, and there's what?  Nine times nine.  Eighty-one boxes.  He completed six out of eighty-one boxes.  He was busy doing a radio show today.  And did you see the Gaga canceled her tour? 
[03:23:30]  What's that?  The Gaga canceled her tour.  Yeah, we talked about that earlier.  What is it?  Well, I...  Oh, you're giving us...  So what did you learn?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  And I learned I was asleep at that hour.  John.  Sam Roberts, the greatest broadcaster ever.  True.  And might I say, every time I hear you on the radio, it's like an eargasm from my ears.  Oh, that's good to hear, buddy.  Hey, here's what I learned today.  That Opie tried to bring the gay back, but Sam Roberts would have no part of it and kept 
[03:24:00]  the gay out of the show today.  I did.  I did.  I think Opie was thinking for the Harlem Shake video that we wanted to do that he would  have...  He would redo some of the gay off that happened yesterday.  But I said, well, we got all this video.  Why...  How funny would it be if a Harlem Shake video started and then it just went to gay...  Like, pseudo-gay porn clips that were YouTube safe?  I mean, I would watch that shit, wouldn't you?  No.  You wouldn't watch it, Rowan? 
[03:24:30]  I think it'd be fun.  Troy, would you dance in a Harlem Shake video?  I guess.  I mean, nah.  You don't want to anymore.  I'm just kind of...  Like, I'm burned out on the gay for a while.  Are you down with the stunts for a little bit?  No, I don't...  I mean, I don't care.  I'll do whatever they want.  I mean, it's...  If we're having fun...  If there's a good vibe in the studio and it's fun, I'll do it.  You know what I mean?  Like, when it's a weird vibe, it's like...  It takes the fun out of it, but...  Ben, you've been involved in some weird vibes.  Yeah.  Yesterday was the fucking...  The pits.  Yeah, that was the depths. 
[03:25:00]  And believe me when I tell you, I've been involved with some shit in my life.  That's definitely up there.  Was that one of the weirdest days of your life?  It's up there, man.  I mean, you've told us all kinds of stories about, you know, banging people in your van  and burning people and who knows what else.  Yeah, no, I mean, I've definitely never been around that much gay.  I mean, you've talked about gangbanging a girl and then he rock cuddling with her.  Yep.  You know, all kinds of...  We covered that one.  All kinds of stuff.  Yeah.  But never that much gay.  Never that much gay. 
[03:25:30]  No.  Even...  Because you rock cuddling with the girl you just gangbanged is somewhat gay.  Well, it wasn't actually a gangbang.  It was more like one after the other after the other.  Oh.  So, like a train.  Nah, a train, I believe, is like multiple people in the same room.  That's what I was thinking, too.  But when we were talking about it yesterday, Jim was thinking, like, you can still go one  at a time and it's a train.  When we tried to do the armpit thing yesterday where everybody was licking each other's armpits,  I thought the same thing as you guys, that a train was everybody licking armpits at the 
[03:26:00]  same time, but Jim was okay with everybody licking each other's armpits one at a time.  That's a round robin.  That's a...  A round robin.  What is?  When you go one at a time.  A train has to be in order.  Have you ever participated in a round robin?  No.  Have you ever heard of a round robin, Troy?  No.  Is that like, would you go to an all-boys school?  No.  Did you go to public school?  No, I'm kidding.  I just...  It's like a similar concept, Sam.  What is?  That if you did it one individual as opposed to doing a train, a train has to be linear.  Right.  Oh, so round robin isn't...  You just made that up? 
[03:26:30]  No, it's just...  That's what a round robin is.  So what part were you kidding about?  About being involved with, like, a gay round robin.  You just said you weren't, so you were kidding.  Yeah, I was kidding.  Yeah, yeah, no.  So you were involved.  No, I wasn't.  I asked you if you were involved and you said no, and then you said I'm kidding.  I got it.  Right, Eric?  Am I crazy?  I know what he was trying to say, but he contradicted it, and it made it sound like  he was involved.  Because I said were you involved, and he goes no, and then he goes, Sam, I'm kidding.  And I go, okay, so you were involved.  Just tell me if you were involved or not.  I don't know.  Sorry.  I got confused there.  You got it. 
[03:27:00]  I mean, Opie, only six boxes on his Sudoku completed today.  Mm-hmm.  He was in this thing.  I need you to be in this thing, Sal.  Mentally there.  Are you still shaking from yesterday?  I'm still fucked up from yesterday.  You shaved your mustache.  Yeah, yeah.  He's still bronzered a little bit.  Yeah, look, you can see that.  You can't get the bronzer out.  I can't get it off.  I got stained.  Look at my arm's stained from the bronzer.  There's bronzer on you.  It splotches on you.  Yeah, it looks like shit.  There's like a shit smear on my arm.  Now, do you feel it, or is it just like your skin is stained now?  Yeah, I just can't get it off.  How long does it stay for?  I don't fucking know, but look at my arm. 
[03:27:30]  You didn't read the bottle?  You're supposed to apply it like twice a week, but this shit really stains your skin.  Yeah, and it's not like Troy did, you did a bad job bronzering him.  I wasn't going for complete accuracy, to be honest with you.  Like, if you worked at a salon, I would not go back to the salon.  Well, I don't think they do it like that.  I think in a salon, it's like a spray tan.  Oh, is it?  It's like an airbrush, where they get accurate, smooth, you know.  Your face, Sal, looks tan.  Yeah.  But your arms look very blotchy. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, my legs are completely stained.  Because you were wearing a thong.  Yeah.  What about your torso?  That surprisingly came off.  Did the Sharpie come off?  Most of it.  Is it still the word slut faintly written on your chest?  Faintly written on my chest.  So the memories are still there?  Yeah, they'll always be there.  I liked yesterday that Sal was bronzered, he was in a thong, and then he was upset about  having to wear lipstick.  Yeah, did you realize, because I was talking to Jess about this when I got home, and like,  you were not happy that you had to do some of the gay things that you did yesterday? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  You were not happy, you were okay, you weren't happy with the tickling, but you were okay.  Like, you were retching, but you were okay.  But you were really unhappy about having to give lap dances, and having to put your asshole  on guys' faces.  Yeah, because that's gay.  But did you learn that, like, when we have a game or whatever, a bit, whatever happened  yesterday, when something like that is going on, for you to walk into the studio and have  bronzer and a thong that you're like, here we go, guys. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, I knew something was going to happen.  I wasn't going to be able to get away with doing nothing, you know.  I mean, they say she asked for it, and they're like, well, you can't say she asked for it,  but you asked for it.  Yeah.  Well, I sort of think that the whole thing, how we got on this, was Sal was going to be  bronzered in a thong, and he was going to fluff, you know, like, to warm up the fucking  Go-Go.  Go-Go dude.  He got here fucking very late, and I had to fill in for Go-Go.  You did.  You were his slot assistant. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  So to think, like, nothing was going to happen while you're sitting in a thong and bronzer,  I mean, that's a little ridiculous.  I never said I didn't think anything was going to happen.  But you didn't like it when it did.  Right.  Excuse me for not liking that shit.  I guess you're right.  No, but you could have stepped up.  You know, you choked a little bit on that.  You still, you think he choked yesterday?  Well, he was visibly, like, he couldn't handle, like, a lap dance.  I had to jump in and take over.  You know what I mean?  And, like, he could, and then finally, like, he saw me do it.  Then it was like, oh, okay, Troy made it okay.  Now it's all right.  I got to tell you, I would have said no if they'd been like, Sam, why don't you go there 
[03:30:00]  and show them how it's done?  Well, let me ask you this.  I'd be like, I'm not going to do it.  Well, would you have been sitting in here bronzered in a thong?  Fuck no!  Okay, well then, and knowing that the reason you're doing this is to fluff up the gay dude.  Yeah, you're right.  I mean, he had a purpose yesterday, didn't he?  Yeah.  Sal, now that it's all over, because it's actually, it's funny.  You know Garrett, stinky.  He works for Jay Thomas now, but he used to work for Opie and Anthony.  I was talking to him yesterday, and he listens to the show on Audible, so he's always a couple, 
[03:30:30]  he's like weeks behind, because he listens to full shows and after shows, so it takes  him a long time to catch up.  Yes, and I thought it was so funny, because, like, I was talking to people yesterday, just  trying to recover from the gay off that we saw, and I go, like, you hear the show today?  And he goes, no, no, I saw pictures.  And I was like, it was not good, dude.  It was, it got weird.  It got really weird in there.  And he said, oh, I'm just at the part now, I'm listening to the after show right now, where  Sal agrees to fluffing up and stuff, and I'm like, wow. 
[03:31:00]  That was two weeks ago when this all started, more or less.  When Sal agreed to fluff up the dancer, when he agreed to the Brazilian wax, when he agreed  to the bronzing, like, you got to this point where you were getting shit on, because back  then, two weeks ago, it was only two weeks ago that all this happened, I think, and all  we were talking about was the fact that Opie hated Sal.  Yeah.  And in that span, Sal, your life's changed.  A lot. 
[03:31:30]  Like, you've done things that will never go out of your memory.  Ever.  Yesterday, it was seriously traumatic for me.  You have been involved in gay sex acts.  You've had a man's mouth on your anus.  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  True.  Not his tongue in, but his mouth on.  True?  Yeah, I guess so, yeah.  I never felt that before, Sal.  No, neither did I until yesterday.  And how was it?  It was awful.  Awful, right?  It was disgusting.  Do you feel like, first of all, do you feel like you're ready to move on from this part 
[03:32:00]  of your life?  Yeah.  Or do you feel like you need to keep proving yourself?  Well, I mean, I'm still open to doing, like, you know, bits and stuff, but not the gay  shit I'm totally done with.  Like, I'm not doing any of that crap anymore.  Well, what kind of bits are you willing to do?  I don't know.  I haven't.  After yesterday, I'm still recovering.  Right, you just want to take a little breather.  Living, yeah.  Like, I was like a zombie yesterday.  Have you told your friends?  No, I'll probably tell them this weekend, though.  Do you feel like you've grown?  Because, like, it was the Brazilian wax.  Yeah. 
[03:32:30]  It was the...  I mean, ever since you told that story on the air of hooking up with the girl from work  and not being able to come with her, life's been very different.  Yeah, everything's been different, yeah.  Do you feel like you're in better standing with the show?  Yeah, I guess.  Do you or don't you?  I do.  I do.  You do?  Yeah.  Troy, do you think it's worked?  This whole thing, because we're now at the finish line.  The whole...  We set up, and you were a very big part of the responsibility for this whole thing. 
[03:33:00]  I was there, too, but you were a big part of this.  It was all set up to put Sal in a better light, specifically with Opie, but with the show in general.  Do you think Sal has been successful?  I do.  You do?  Yeah.  And you could even tell this morning, Opie talking to Sal, he's, you know...  It was...  Before, like, I don't know.  Opie couldn't even look at him.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, look, you know, Opie likes when...  And the guys like when you step up and do something for the show.  You know what I mean?  It's important to the show. 
[03:33:30]  Whatever it is, like, what are you contributing to the show?  Yeah.  It was maybe the first time that I saw Opie have an on-air conversation with Sal.  Yeah.  That wasn't like...  Or like, you know, shut up.  You know, just something where you annoyed him.  Yeah, I think it's a new sense of commitment and, you know, loyalty to the show.  Yeah.  I think that they saw.  Yeah.  Now...  It's important.  It's very important.  Are you going to try to take this now?  You have some positive...  I guess you can shape this into having some positive energy for you in terms of the show. 
[03:34:00]  Are you going to take this standing and maybe try to work on creative things for the show so you don't have to...  Consistently embarrass myself.  Well, that's what you'd have to do, right?  It only lasts for so long.  Yeah, only a little.  We need another whipping boy.  Yeah.  Why did you look at E-Rock when I said that?  Because he's on his phone.  Well...  He's not listening.  You know why?  Because E-Rock decided a long time ago.  So, he's like, well, if I do some weird stunts, Opie and Anthony will like me more and I don't have to worry about, you know, doing any work. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, I don't do that.  I'm cool with doing stunts.  Like, that's all well and good.  It's just the whole gay sexual nature of it is completely done on my end and, you know, for the show as well.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Do you believe that?  No.  Me neither.  Manuel in Oakland.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Is that what it is?  Manuel?  Yeah, that's right.  All right.  How are you doing, man?  All right.  Hey, I wanted to know, what did Sal and Troy do to wash the gay away? 
[03:35:00]  What did you do, Sal?  I mean, I know that, you know, you got in the shower to wash away some of that, the bronzer and stuff like that to cleanse your soul.  You know, what did you do to get the gay out of your body?  I don't know.  It's still in there, isn't it?  I jerked off some hetero porn last night.  Was it hetero porn?  What type of porn was it?  I don't know.  It was probably just some, like, black chick.  I'm really on this, like, black chick kick lately.  You like black girl porn?  I really want to hook up with a black chick.  Black girl, white guy? 
[03:35:30]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  So, because you like to see yourself as that guy?  Yeah.  Or as the girl?  Hmm.  Which one?  Come on.  Which one do you see yourself as?  I see myself as the guy.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  He says, come on, like, that's an unreasonable question for Sal.  When you watch porn, do you see yourself, if you watch a guy and a girl having sex, who do you see yourself as being?  I see myself as the guy.  Right.  Okay.  That was an easy one.  A lot easier for Troy to answer on.  Just say that.  He didn't say, come on, Sam.  Do you really have to ask? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  I was saying, come on, in sarcasm to the joke.  It was a stupid question.  I told you I jerked off to hetero porn.  I mean, was there anything stupid, Roland?  Was that a stupid question?  No.  I mean, Sal, you do understand why it's a question.  Yeah.  I get it.  I get it.  Yes.  From yesterday, yeah, I can see why.  No, not from way before yesterday.  But the bottom line is, let's just consider yesterday.  You had a man's mouth on your anus.  Yesterday.  Remember when we said that a minute ago?  Yesterday was just...  That happened, right?  Yeah, I remember it happening.  Okay.  Okay.  So, you understand.  Yes.  Okay.  Yesterday was the icing on the cake.  Is what it was. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it was a heaping helping of it, wasn't it?  Yeah.  What about you?  Manwa wants to know.  Well, first of all, I'm still up from yesterday.  So, I'm delirious at this point.  And I have this...  I have images burned into my brain.  That's probably...  It might even be better.  Because at least now you have that weird kind of cloudiness.  Yeah.  So, maybe...  Because you start daydreaming when you don't sleep at night.  So, maybe you can kind of pawn off your horrible memories as like, oh, it's just all part of the cloudiness that's going on up there.  Right now, the image that is burned in my head is that the one dude, the taller dude, standing on his knees looking up at Go-Go. 
[03:37:00]  And Go-Go taking his penis and using it.  It looked like a paintbrush.  Like how you would paint.  And he was just running it up and down his lips and on his nose.  Can you believe you saw that?  And I'm just looking at it.  And that's when it really kind of hit me like, dude.  Like, oh, boy.  Well, I don't know.  Listen to the first hour of today's show, either on the replay or on demand.  Because we went into all this and like, you know, how he recovered and everything.  And I'm just saying my worst part was seeing... 
[03:37:30]  I think it was the same guy, the bald dude.  Yeah.  That was taller.  Like when he was on top of Go-Go, he was grabbing his dick.  But he also scooped him by the ass.  So, he was like holding him up.  Yeah.  Like closer to him.  But my bad one is the same guy.  He was, I guess, doing like reverse cowgirl when Go-Go was sitting on the couch.  I think it's reverse cowboy.  Cowboy, yeah.  And he just, he was holding, reaching around behind his back, holding Go-Go's flaccid dick.  Just rubbing it in between his ass creaks.  And I was just like, ah, this is it.  So, did you do, when you got home, because we said you had to leave early yesterday. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  You couldn't be here anymore.  I just was just, I was maxed out.  Yeah.  I get it.  Trust me.  I get it.  I was done.  I really couldn't, I couldn't work.  I was just, I'm sitting there recording my Hits 1 show for overnight and trying to talk  some bullshit about Taylor Swift for seven seconds between pop songs.  And all I'm thinking about is like, oh, I saw a guy making out with a guy and getting  cock slapped at the same time today.  That's, that's all I wanted to talk about on it because it was always in my brain. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  You can't do that on Hits 1.  No.  Kid Kelly would have been so pissed.  Yeah.  So, what did you, you said you jerked off?  Yeah, I went home, I just, I just went in line, just jerked off to porno and that was  that.  And then I, then I tried to take a nap.  I couldn't fall asleep.  What type of porno did you watch?  I watched Asian porno.  Asian porno.  Yeah.  All the Asian women that were here yesterday.  Yeah.  They were really cute.  I, that's not why I did it, but I, I, they were cute.  Yeah.  I, I, I, all four girls I thought were, were pretty girls.  I, and they kind of like, I mean, no offense to those dudes, but they're, you know, those 
[03:39:00]  guys, those girls were definitely out of their league, out of those guys' leagues.  Yeah.  I don't normal, I don't, a lot of the times because of our schedule, because I'm tired,  I don't have a lot of sex during the week.  Yeah.  I had to have sex last night.  You did?  Had to.  Yeah.  It's, it's fucking weird, man.  It's, it's a, definitely, it was a weird.  With a girl.  Yeah.  It was a segment.  Well, I would, I would.  It was with my wife.  Your, your, your sexuality is never in question.  Thank you.  Thank you, Trump.  I mean, I never.  You've known me to be a heterosexual.  You, there's nothing that you do that is questionable in any way. 
[03:39:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Except the wrestling thing.  Sometimes.  Well, that's just, that's just silly.  It's goofiness, isn't it?  It's like, it's childlike is what it is.  But it's, there's nothing sexual about it.  Well, I mean, you could look into it and go, there's something sexual there.  Because, I mean, there are men rolling around with each other in very small little bikinis.  You could say the same thing about UFC even more so.  Yeah, but those men are beating the fucking bloody bullshit out of each other.  They're doing a lot more rolling and their shorts are a lot of times smaller.  You're right.  And a lot of times those, I've, when I train jujitsu, a lot of those guys are, they do 
[03:40:00]  some weird shit where they roll over and they graze certain areas and.  And I'm not saying that the UFC is gay.  No, no, I'm not saying that either.  You could say it both ways.  What about you, Roland?  You weren't here for the first hour of the show this morning.  What did you do to cleanse your palate yesterday?  I didn't, I just saw like probably a minute from the booth.  You couldn't watch it?  No, I just, I just listened to it.  You did?  I couldn't watch it.  So you're not affected as much?  No, not at all.  I mean, I saw the, all the management were there watching.  They're like, I'm out of here.  You were able to put it out of your head.  I had to. 
[03:40:30]  Eric, did you do any jerking off?  No, I had to leave here, go to my brother's house and then drive all the way back to Jersey.  And by the time I got home, I just blacked out and went to sleep.  You got a lot of drinking?  No.  Just tired.  Sal, you said you were, you did some drinking on your own last night.  Drinking alone is probably like one of the most pathetic things I think I can do.  Oh yeah, I mean, it's one of the sheer signs, I mean, a lot of people say, well, that's  like the first two steps of alcoholism right there.  Yeah, yeah.  I drank a lot.  What did you drink?  I had two IPAs, two beers, and then I had a. 
[03:41:00]  What's IPA?  Indian Pale Ale, it's a strong beer.  Okay.  And then I had, I had three gin and tonics.  That was fucking great.  Is gin and tonic like a cool drink or is that a feminine drink?  It's like an old lady drink.  Yeah, that sounds like an old lady drink.  It's like an older drink.  But it's like, it's, you know.  Gets the job done?  Yeah, it's a class.  It's a drink when shit happens, you're like, just give me a gin and tonic.  Just give me a gin and tonic.  I'll start off there and then.  And you weren't in a bar, you were just in your house.  I was at my house drinking.  Making yourself drinks.  Yeah, I was drinking a fucking solo cup.  I was like, this is bad. 
[03:41:30]  It was gin and tonics in a solo cup?  Yeah, I don't have like, you know, nice glasses.  Oh, what did you think when you're sitting there?  You could still mentally feel a man's goatee on your anus.  Yeah, it was prickly, yeah.  You're drinking by yourself.  What do you think of your life at that point?  I was so depressed.  You were?  I was so depressed yesterday.  Yeah.  That's got to fuck you up if you go to wipe yourself, right?  You keep thinking about that?  No, no, no, no.  Because I'm all waxed.  I quit wiping.  That's right.  You're still all waxed from the last thing. 
[03:42:00]  Jesus.  Can you imagine what a mess Sal is mentally right now?  Because he's dealing with the whole gay thing that he doesn't know, but, you know, will  eventually come out.  Yeah.  And then you have all the waxing and the gay, oh.  I saw that brown water coming off my body in the shower and I was just like.  Just crying.  I was just depressed.  Yeah.  Just the brown water mixing with tears.  Yeah, it was bad.  The only thing diluting it was the salty, salty tears.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  Did you find Gogo attractive at all? 
[03:42:30]  No.  He was an attractive guy.  When he took his pants off, I just like.  He was in great shape, dude.  He was in amazing shape.  You can't deny he was in great shape, right?  Yeah, he was in good shape, I guess.  I mean, I don't really.  I don't think that when I see a guy.  When I see a guy start taking his pants off like that, I turn.  He was in ridiculous shape.  Yeah.  That's a guy who works out all the time.  And that's his real name, Harder.  And doesn't need any carbs.  No, that's his job, dude.  Bruce in Louisiana.  Well, hello, Sam.  Hello, Bruce.  I just wanted to call and thank Sal for getting the gay out yesterday. 
[03:43:00]  Listening to it wasn't too great, but when I looked at that photo where he was wearing  that ball bag and it was empty, it just made me want to come out all the more.  You're out of the closet because of Sal, Bruce.  Oh, my God.  He's wonderful.  I love you, Sal.  Bruce is out of the closet because of Sal.  Now, Sal, now that you've heard Bruce's story and he shared that with all of us, Sal, go ahead  and say to Bruce whatever you want to say. 
[03:43:30]  I'm not far behind.  Good luck to you, Bruce.  That's it?  Congratulations.  You have any announcements?  Okay.  Sam, I do not like men.  Thank you, Sal.  Love you.  Goodbye, Bruce.  Skittles.  Skittles, indeed.  Holy shit.  You know what everybody's talking about, Roland.  Skittles?  The Dollar Shave Club video.  Skittles tries it.  You know, Skittles, they try to make these ads that everybody talks about and they put them  online.  They don't go viral.  DollarShaveClub.com.  They put up that video. 
[03:44:00]  It goes viral.  Over 9 million hits on this thing.  Everybody's talking about it.  Opie hasn't seen it yet, but I told him about it.  I've seen it.  It's hilarious.  It's actually really funny.  Spoiler alert.  There's a, you know, a guy in a bear suit and a toddler shaving a dude's head.  Everybody buys razors, right?  Well, brand name razor companies, they nail you.  They build them with 10 blades and the vibrating handles, something like a built-in back scratcher.  Good Lord.  You end up paying up the wazoo for these razors.  I don't mind wazoo staying in the copy. 
[03:44:30]  I hope he doesn't like it.  I don't mind it.  Well, DollarShaveClub.com says, stop overpaying for shave technology that you don't need.  All us guys want is a great shave without shelling out 20 bucks month after month.  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be crazy not to do this.  All you do, you send them a couple bucks a month and they deliver great quality razor blades right to your door.  No more digging through the trash for that old blade that zombied out your face yesterday.  Go to DollarShaveClub.com. 
[03:45:00]  Watch the video and laugh hard.  That's DollarShaveClub.com.  DollarShaveClub.com.  You feeling okay, Sal?  Yeah.  We all have the same, I think, expression right now.  We're all, like, exhausted.  Still fatigued and shell shocks from yesterday.  I am fantastic.  You're okay because you didn't have to deal with any of it.  No.  But remember when I walked in, I just heard my name, Ron!  I just turned around and kept walking and left.  Well, it's funny listening to, like, you know, I said it on Ron and Fez yesterday, but Anthony, 
[03:45:30]  Anthony's a guy who does not get into a bad mood, right?  Yeah.  Hang on one sec.  Randy in Toronto.  Hey, Sam.  I just heard you talking about DollarShaveClub.  I joined up, like, two or three weeks ago.  I know this sounds like a plant, but it is the shit.  You like it.  I'm going to save, like, so much money.  I live in Canada.  I get raped for razors.  Yeah.  It's, like, 22 bucks for, like, a four-pack.  So, DollarShaveClub, it's, like, I think I pay six bucks a month.  And they were solid. 
[03:46:00]  They were late with the first delivery.  Gave me a month free.  They are the shit.  Didn't you already tell me this already?  No, no.  It's the first time calling in, bro.  All right.  Well, I'm glad that they saved you from getting raped.  All right, man.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  I can't say that much for Sal, though.  No, no.  You can't really.  I mean, Sal was very close yesterday.  Do you think you can send that to them, but don't send this part?  Do you think they're setting up calls to call in?  I was thinking that because either earlier this week or the end of last week when these things started, 
[03:46:30]  somebody called in saying that they were using this service, but it was, like, right away.  But they called in and they said the same thing about the razors being late, and then DollarShaveClub replaced them.  Maybe that's just, like, a workaround that people are doing.  And that guy actually sounded Canadian.  No, I think he was Canadian.  I just wonder if the company is having people call the show.  I mean, they don't have to.  The product works.  Yeah, if they can get an extra plug in, why not?  I guess so.  But if you're going to do that, call in later. 
[03:47:00]  Don't call in at the same time as your ad is on.  Silly gooses.  Geese.  Anthony was in a bad mood yesterday.  He's never in a bad mood.  Anthony is always just, he doesn't give a shit.  He's just ready to have a good time.  That's what he's here.  He does the radio show to have fun.  You know what I mean?  And yesterday he was out.  He was out of this yesterday.  Well, he had to deal with the State of the Union first, and then he had the gay off.  I've never seen, well, no, State of the Union was whatever.  He always gets mad about Obama, but, you know, he makes a show out of it, and then we move on. 
[03:47:30]  And he's never tapped out of something.  I've never seen Anthony tap out of something.  Never.  Yesterday he was not in this.  You said, Troy, didn't you, that there was a show going on, this whole gay off thing,  and Jim was dictating it, and you were dictating it, and I was dictating it.  Anthony was over here talking to Opie about other stuff completely.  Yeah.  Wanted no part of it.  And rightly so.  Yeah.  I mean, they were the ones making the right move.  Yeah.  We, like fools, were trying to make this thing happen.  Should have just followed Opie and Anthony's lead. 
[03:48:00]  We'd probably be a lot healthier.  But my question is, okay, so fine, we got rid of gay.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you think it would be the perfect opportunity to, let's get fucking broads in here ASAP.  Nothing's booked or scheduled yet.  To tell you the truth, anything sexual right now, I mean, I would love to see broads, but  I don't know what to do with this show right now.  Maybe that's the way Opie and Anthony are feeling.  They don't want to commit to anything anymore.  I'm telling you, I pitched an idea. 
[03:48:30]  They need a recovery process.  I pitched an idea in the meeting, and it got shot down, but I'm telling you, we should  have had broads here yesterday to even out the gay immediately.  Yeah, it's true that you see at least three.  Well, I mean, we had to, when, what would we have done with them?  Get fucking naked.  Let's see your buttholes and pussies.  But we did, the gay off lasted two hours.  Well, I mean, what's his name showed up late, so that fucked everything up.  But if he would have showed up on time, you could have had some broads in here.  Or, better yet, put broads back here in the corner, so it's like when there's too much 
[03:49:00]  gay, you can look over there and go, oh, God, look, there's some hot bitches.  There's some bitches.  Yeah, okay.  Just have them here, you mean.  Yeah.  You just want some naked bitches just here.  I just said to even out the gay.  And Troy did say, if you don't have that, weird shit will happen.  And look what happened.  Weird shit happened.  Nobody wants to listen to me.  Well, I mean, it's a ridiculous idea.  You just want naked women here as wallpaper.  Fucking some dude making his dick into a paintbrush on some other dude's lips.  That was also your idea.  That was your idea, too.  No, I'm saying, but that's not a weird idea. 
[03:49:30]  That was yours.  Right.  So having bitches in here is a bad idea?  As wallpaper, it's a silly idea.  We're not going to hire women to come in here and be wallpapered.  You don't need to hire them.  You need to hire Go-Go.  Yeah, you do.  He's putting his penis on people's lips.  And every time when girls come in here for free, they go take off your clothes.  Oh, no, you can buy the magazine for that.  Oh, you can see the video for that.  But with those girls, are they prefaced?  Of course they are.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  But remember what we discussed.  Our history prefaces us.  Okay.  So do they say, hey, look, you're going to have to go in there and get naked. 
[03:50:00]  And do you agree to doing this?  Multiple times the girls have said, yeah, they may ask you to take your clothes off.  Oh, okay.  And then they get in, and Opie and Anthony ask them to take their clothes off, and they  don't do it.  Okay.  That Dennis Rodman chick, she didn't want to get naked at all.  Happens all the time.  Well, I mean.  It's happened many times.  The guy, they do, there's a lot of guys in here that are predator-like as soon as they  walk in here.  Look.  Right?  So what girl, so what girl's going to be like, oh, that's a fucking, second they walk  in, like, everybody's trying to fuck them. 
[03:50:30]  I can't account, first of all, do this scenario and then have gay sex shit going on in the  background.  I'm telling you, if it would have been okayed, if it would have been like, cool, let's get  some fucking broads in here, I would have found broads to get naked in here.  I would have.  But I got shot down immediately.  No, because they need to be strippers.  No, they don't.  And strippers don't come in unless they're getting paid.  No, they don't.  If you can get naked girls in, then get naked girls in.  I could.  But what are we going to do?  Let's do it.  If we think about what they want them in.  I'm not just going to show up on tomorrow morning with naked girls.  If you have girls in here that are naked, what, are you going to get in trouble? 
[03:51:00]  No.  What, are they going to yell at you?  If they want them, I'll get them.  Yeah, of course they want them.  Everybody loves naked women.  Do they?  You're saying Opie Anthony may be gay.  I'm not saying they're gay.  But I don't know if they want women in here.  Because they've passed on so many girls.  I think they'd like to see, because of the history of the girls on this show.  But no one ever sits down and goes, okay, what could we do with these girls?  Because they don't do anything.  If you have a fun idea picked out of what we can do with them, where we sit down and shoot ideas.  No, there's no shooting ideas at anybody. 
[03:51:30]  Because we've had ideas for girls.  And?  And the girls come in, and they don't do it.  Let me fucking talk to Lainey.  Somebody's not talking to Lainey right.  The guy who could barely speak.  Oh, Roland.  And in Roland's defense, this was before Roland, this shit was going on.  Why don't you go find the cock to suck?  I'm not even going to do it.  Tom in Philly.  Son of a bitch.  Sammy, sweetheart, professional broadcaster with the best hair on radio. 
[03:52:00]  How are you?  That's exactly right.  What's up, buddy?  Got to tell you, Dollar Shave Club saved my life.  It did?  I was homeless on the streets.  Had a beer down to my knees.  Wow.  Going to Dollar Shave Club.  Got all clean.  Now I'm a goddamn stockbroker.  Because when you were homeless, you could afford a couple bucks for razors.  Well, you know, I hit up some crackheads and got a couple of bucks together.  And now you're...  Dollar Shave Club, look at me now, buddy.  How much money do you make, like, in a month as a stockbroker?  Two, three bucks.  All right.  Well, that's still better than being homeless, right? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  I mean, times are tough.  All right.  Thanks, Tom.  Mm-hmm.  Cut that for him, too.  Opie, in order to cleanse himself,  he went out on the street.  And Opie's lost his mind.  At some point, he lost it.  Maybe, I think he lost it a long time ago.  This video...  Play the video, Sal.  He put up this video,  and we played a little bit of it during the show today.  He's talking to this homeless guy.  What's it called, Sal?  Nigga.  My nigga is Satan.  He doesn't like people. 
[03:53:00]  And it's this weird homeless guy.  You know, people who are...  And he's got this bandana on.  He's an old man.  He's got layers on.  He's got a green glove and a purple glove on.  And he keeps doing hand signals throughout the entire video,  like he's talking in sign language.  And everything that everybody else does.  Now, this guy...  Yeah, go ahead.  It's like he's doing gang signs.  It is.  He looks like he's about to start crip walking.  Let me help you to relax.  I looked at this video and said he's completely unpredictable, right?  Like, I wouldn't approach this guy. 
[03:53:30]  Then, Opie goes on to say,  you know, I didn't even catch him on a good day.  On a good day, he's throwing chairs trying to shatter a window.  He's chucking chairs at bank windows trying to shatter them.  And I'm sitting there going,  Opie, you're a billionaire.  Not a billionaire yet.  It's probably close.  Opie is a millionaire.  I mean, you look at the end of this video.  Look at the end of the video.  But he's a crazy whisperer.  They come to him and they feel safe.  You think so? 
[03:54:00]  Every time I go out video with him like a crazy guy,  Opie is a millionaire.  They all feel safe with him.  He's a millionaire.  He's a father of two.  And he's playing peekaboo with an unpredictable homeless man  on the sidewalk in New York City on February whatever.  On February 13th.  He's out there on the sidewalk in New York City  playing peekaboo with a homeless man through a potted plant.  Well, the other guy was with him,  was like kicking people, spitting on people.  Opie walked right up to him and the guy did nothing to him.  He didn't?  Nothing to him.  But then he continued to kick and spit people 
[03:54:30]  while he was talking to Opie.  But not him.  So he gives Opie the story.  Yeah.  He's like he's safe.  Like he feels safe around him.  And then Opie could just film.  Film and then he walks away and the guy attacks people.  It's hilarious.  And Roland, if you or I went up to these people,  we would have been attacked.  We would have been attacked.  Yes.  We would have absolutely been attacked.  I'm scared half the time.  I don't know how he does it.  I mean, if I was, if I was a million, if I was Opie,  I'd be sitting on top of New York City in my awesome apartment  being like, good thing I don't have to go out and film homeless people 
[03:55:00]  because I'm a millionaire.  Yeah.  But no, this is how he gets his kicks.  Homeless people doing gang signs and playing peek-a-boo with them through potted plants.  The video's on Opie Radio.  I think it's, uh, I think it's on our Facebook too, right, E-Rack?  Yes, it is.  All right.  A lot of people want to talk about getting the bitches back on the show.  John in Ohio.  Hey, uh, truck on.  Yep.  Hey, it's not that the guys don't want the women on there and do fun shit with them.  It's, they've been shot down by management so much. 
[03:55:30]  It's like they've just kind of given up and said, why even bother?  We know how it's going to end up.  No, I totally understand that.  But, I mean, you can do other things other than, I mean, look,  those guys, they had a lot of fun and they did some crazy shit back in the day.  So it's like, I know that they probably would like to do things similar to what they did.  But you can still do fun things with girls.  But that's what a lot of that is, that.  Because you go and you have all these great ideas and you want to do stuff  and you're thinking, oh, this is what we have done.  Let's do something on this level.  And you just get told, no, no, we can't do this, we can't do that. 
[03:56:00]  And you're like, fuck it then.  No, I do understand that.  You know what I mean?  I do understand that.  I mean, it's the same thing with you.  You know, you've come in here and be like, well, I don't give a fuck.  No, I don't understand.  But if they're saying on air that we need to get girls back on the show,  we need to get girls back on the show, then it's like, all right,  then we can figure something out.  Stu.  Yeah, I think calling back from the N.E.W. days,  doing the wiffle ball back contest,  that's what you guys should be doing with the naked girls. 
[03:56:30]  We would do the wiffle ball contest in a heartbeat,  but you can't stick a wiffle ball in a girl's pussy anymore.  Yeah.  You can't do it.  That's insertion.  You're inserting it into her vagina.  Gotta love management.  I mean, I don't know who it is.  Might be lawyers.  I don't know who makes the calls here.  But you can't do it.  Mike in PA.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is an idea I got from Taylor Vickson.  She pleaded the other day that she wanted to know how much her boobs weighed. 
[03:57:00]  Didn't Danny come up with a way to do that?  Yeah, I mean, we could do a contest where you weigh boobs,  but it's like, I don't know.  You just go at the end, oh, wow, you have the biggest boobs.  That's it.  That's a little like, I don't know, small market radio to me.  Like, how much your boobs weigh seems a little, you know, a little wacky.  A little morning zoo-ish.  I know it's not quite Ryan Seacrest, but it's a little waka waka, you know?  So do you think you should just admit defeat and be like,  okay, well, we'd like girls in here, 
[03:57:30]  but we can't think of anything to do with them, so we won't do it.  I'm all for, if you say you can find girls who will get naked in here,  find those girls, Troy.  I will.  Find those girls.  That ball's in your court.  I mean, somebody's, apparently I'm the only one that has to step up and take care of shit.  I take care of shit on the daily.  I know you do.  You know that.  But this is not my department.  I'm telling you, I don't know any girls that will get naked on this radio show.  So you say you do. 
[03:58:00]  Sal hangs out with mainly guys, so he could help us.  If we wanted to do something like yesterday, I'm sure Sal could help us out with that.  Roland, do you think you're not talking to Laney properly from Penthouse?  I don't know that world.  You don't?  If you let me talk to her, I'll talk to her and break it down, like, what is going on.  Does Troy need to be the new pornography booker on the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, she'll say, here's what the girls are willing to do before they come in.  And I present it to the guys.  But then a lot of times they come in and they're not willing to do it, right?  And it's like, what can you, that's not, what can you do? 
[03:58:30]  You can't control people.  Then you just go, okay, you don't get your plugs.  Hold them over them.  Yeah, here they are.  No, you don't get them.  This is what you said you were going to do.  I'll pass on to Troy.  I'll be more than, I'll, I'll.  He can be the porno guy.  He can be the porno guy.  I'll talk to Lainey and then I'll talk to the girls personally and be like, look, this  is what we need to do.  If you're not going to do this.  Don't go in there.  Don't waste our time.  Stop.  We got other shit to do.  Yes.  Hope he's got Sudoku.  We should totally make Troy do this.  Yep.  You got it.  He's the man for it.  You got to fucking break shit down to these bitches.  You think Sal can handle it? 
[03:59:00]  No.  No.  All right.  You got to know how to regulate that pussy.  We got, and do you know how to do that?  I don't know.  We got to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you next week because tomorrow will be Jim Norton's advice show.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Slab out!  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
