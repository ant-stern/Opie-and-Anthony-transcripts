<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Opie recounting a humorous, albeit embarrassing, incident of mistakenly holding Danny's hand instead of Lindsay's during a Mets game.  This was followed by a segment showcasing Big Kev's celebrity interviews, which were heavily criticized by Sam and the hosts for their poor quality and brevity.  The interviews included Val Kilmer (deemed boring), Adam West (hampered by technical difficulties), and Catherine Bach (with Big Kev asking inappropriate and insensitive questions). Big Kev was present in-studio for this segment. The show then transitioned into a discussion of a National Enquirer article alleging homosexual encounters between Merv Griffin and River Phoenix, with the hosts engaging in graphic and sexually explicit commentary.  This was followed by a segment focusing on relationships and sex, featuring vulgar and sexually explicit discussions with callers about topics such as first-date hookups, infidelity, and detecting lies about sexual activity.

Later, comedian Jim Jefferies joined the show,  a significant portion of which focused on his intense, almost phobic fear of bananas. The hosts repeatedly provoked him with bananas, escalating to giving him a banana peel hat, leading to Jefferies' discomfort and even briefly leaving the studio.  Following Jefferies, George A. Romero, director of numerous zombie films, appeared as a guest. The conversation centered on his zombie films, their cultural impact (especially in video games), his creative process, the evolution of the zombie genre, and the social commentary in his work.  Romero shared anecdotes about the challenges of filming, including acquiring cockroaches for a scene and dealing with Canadian film unions. He also discussed his less successful film, *Bruiser*, and his preference for practical effects over CGI.  The interview also touched on audience reactions to his films, including a caller's anecdote about his father punching him after a viewing in Japan.

The discussion then shifted to Anthony's recent breakup and subsequent loneliness,  with humorous commentary from the hosts and staff on attempts to set him up on dates.  Patrice O'Neal joined the show around this time, adding comedic commentary to Anthony's toothache and upcoming dentist visit.  A significant portion of the show then detailed Anthony's severe toothache, with live (or near-live) updates via phone from the dentist's office,  with Patrice O'Neal in studio providing commentary. The conversation included descriptions of the pain, Anthony's self-treatment attempts with rum, the dentist's examination (including x-rays revealing an infection), and the procedure itself (with sounds of the dentist's tools audible on air). The dentist was described as Jewish, prompting jokes from Patrice and the hosts.

Following this, the conversation turned to Jerry Seinfeld's Fiat accident, with humorous speculation about Seinfeld's wealth and car collection, focusing on the incongruity of driving a less expensive car.  The show continued with jokes about a pregnant man and a discussion about notable product failures, including the Apple Lisa, McDonald's Arch Deluxe, Sony Betamax, Coca-Cola's New Coke, the IBM PC Junior, DeLorean, and Edsel cars.  The segment included numerous racist remarks during the Edsel commercial discussion. Callers contributed anecdotes, with one claiming the porn industry's adoption of VHS contributed to Betamax's failure.  The discussion broadened to include historical societal blunders, such as the use of mercury in hats, radium paint dangers, lack of safety measures in early hockey and automobiles, the use of x-ray machines as novelties in shoe stores, and the lack of sophisticated military tactics in early wars. A caller also mentioned the use of iron lungs for polio patients. Throughout this segment, the humor relied heavily on shock value and offensive language, with frequent profanity and offensive statements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, this one involves you, and he keeps going.  He just goes with you.  It's got to be a radio guy right to the end.  Jesus.  Okay, well, I will.  First of all, what do you need to know?  All right, you went to a Mets game with Danny.  Yes.  How'd that turn out for you?  Well, who kind of set up was that?  None.  Well, the punchline is it was Danny's hand.  All right, move on.  There it is.  Enjoy it. 
[00:00:30]  Enjoy.  And keep that in mind as you listen to this bit on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  One of the most humiliating experiences of my life, absolutely.  I feel like a schmuck.  Also, another time I felt like a schmuck was when I went into the movie theater to see Semi-Pro.  And as I'm walking in, I'm like, oh, my God, my fans are here.  Look at them all.  Oh, yeah.  Look at them all standing in the movie theater, waving their hands left and right.  They're like, wow, it's a very dark audience.  We really must be hitting on all cylinders with our radio show because we're bringing 
[00:01:00]  in the black listeners.  And stupid me, it took me a while to realize that they were throwing out prizes behind my  back as I walked in.  What an idiot.  But that's not what this is.  This is that other humiliating moment.  Sam, I know that.  But I was giving the people a little extra.  But the thing is, the people are going to listen to that.  And since that's the last thing they heard, they're going to get confused going into this  bit thinking it's going to be about Semi-Pro.  I have confidence in the listeners.  They can multitask. 
[00:01:30]  The answer to the bit you're about to hear, Danny's hand.  The other thing, just a little extra.  It's like a DVD extra for everybody.  So enjoy it on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Great.  What the fuck is this?  You're listening to The Worst.  What the fuck is this?  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, I did enjoy the Mets game yesterday.  But I have to ask the audience.  I have to ask Anthony and whoever else wants to listen.  I have a funnier gay.  Gang bang from the entire Mets team. 
[00:02:00]  No, because that would be gay.  Well, I decided to pick up marshmallows in front of the entire Mets team.  I thought it'd be funny.  They yelled gay.  No.  You're a man taking on the entire team.  It's gay.  I had great box seats right off first base.  And then Mark Chernoff comes down to see how the seats are and stuff.  And we're chatting.  We're chit-chatting.  Little chit-chat.  And then he's like, you want to go up to one of the suites?  They have a suite at Shea Stadium as well that they give to clients. 
[00:02:30]  I'm like, yeah, let's check out the game from up above now.  Because we sat in the box seats for about six innings.  I'm like, yeah, let's go check it out.  And they have food and beer up there, right?  So I get out of my seats.  I'm way down close to the field.  So I have to walk up.  And then I have to walk to my right to the exit.  It's a long walk in front of a ton of Mets fans.  A ton of Mets fans.  And quite frankly, a lot of O&A fans.  You know, and Opie, you know, blah, blah, blah.  Where's Anthony?  All that, right?  So I'm with Lindsay and I'm with Danny. 
[00:03:00]  Danny goes to the game.  So I turn as I'm starting my walk.  I turn and I grab Lindsay's hand, right?  Yeah.  And we start walking.  And now it's getting, you know, very tight.  So she's behind me, but I have her hand.  So then I reach back lovingly.  And I grab her other hand.  You know how you do that, right?  You do the two-hand grab from behind you.  The two-hand grab from behind.  And now I'm walking with what I think is Lindsay's hands. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And I'm walking through the crowd, right?  And then she lets go.  So now I'm only holding one of her hands.  Right.  And I'm really into it.  You know, I had a really good day.  And I'm like just holding her hand and walking us out of the place so we could go up into the suite.  Yep.  Just as I get to the, what is it called, the exit or whatever, and now no one sees you anymore,  I turn because now I could like, you know, kind of pull her, you know, to my side.  Yep.  And that's when I find out it was Danny! 
[00:04:00]  You had been holding Danny's hand?  Through the crowd!  I walked through the crowd.  Oh my God, how embarrassing.  They set me up so bad.  They set me up so effing bad.  Bravo, Danny.  Why, thank you.  So what happened was...  Wow, that is embarrassing as all hell.  So what happened was when I turned and grabbed Lindsay's hand, I had Lindsay's hand.  Yeah.  And now I'm turning around and I'm walking us out and she's behind me.  You go for the double hold. 
[00:04:30]  When I go for the double hold, it's not Lindsay's second hand.  Danny grabs on at that point.  So for a little while, I was holding Lindsay's hand and Danny's hand.  And Lindsay, who has a great sense of humor, realizes what's going on here and let's go.  Let go, man.  And now I'm really feeling the moment like, oh, this is such a cool thing.  Was he taking his thumb and kind of rubbing your hand, Danny?  I don't think I was.  If I was doing it, I was doing it subconsciously.  So now I'm holding Danny's hand through the entire...  Not the entire crowd, but the entire section. 
[00:05:00]  Do you know what people must have thought that no you...  I'm praying no one took a picture.  And they're looking going, why is he holding that man's hand and walking him upstairs?  And it was like, oh, my God, that is so funny and gay.  And then the laughter, it was just unbelievable.  Unbelievable when I turn around like, you got to be kidding me.  And I'm like, I didn't even notice like your calloused hand.  Yeah.  Come on, dude.  I didn't even notice. 
[00:05:30]  So, and then on the way home, Danny brought up a little something and he's completely right.  We had an awkward home run high five moment.  Okay.  Can we just delete that from any recording of this show?  Stop it.  You didn't high five.  I was really into being there because I haven't been to a Mets game in a few seasons now.  A big fan I am, I know.  But I haven't been to a game.  Oh, my God.  I was too busy traveling around America when we weren't doing radio. 
[00:06:00]  And since, you know, going back to radio 18, 19 months ago for XM first, I just haven't had time.  Up top, Danny.  Yeah.  Up top, Big D.  So, it happened.  It happened and I thought nothing of it.  But on the way home, he had acknowledged, you know, we had an awkward high five home run moment.  But high fiving someone during the home run moment is gayer than holding his hand for the walk to the box.  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  Who hit the? 
[00:06:30]  I think it was Reyes.  Yeah, yeah.  Unless it was Danny, you shouldn't have high fived.  I'll tell you what happened.  We're in the box seats, though.  And home run, right?  Everyone jumps up.  And I realize I'm a pretty good sports fan when I get into my team.  You should see me at the Islander games.  They go nuts, right?  And so, the home run is hit and now I jump up and now I'm looking around.  Uh-oh.  Usually, I'm with a family member or something.  I don't care.  I know I could yell, no homo and everything's cool, right?  So, I turn to my right and it's a box filled with O&A fans. 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, I'm not high fiving these guys.  No.  So, then I turn to my left and Lindsey's like still sitting on her hands because she's a Phillies fan.  So, she's not getting up.  Yeah.  So, then I turn around because now I'm up.  It's awkward.  Oh, my God.  You're looking around for the high-fiving person.  It's kind of like when you go to church and you have to do the sign of peace and you look around awkwardly.  Turn to your neighbor.  You look around awkwardly.  You got to shake someone's hand.  Peace be with you.  Right.  Peace be with you.  So, then I turn around and it's Danny. 
[00:07:30]  Were you up?  I think you were up.  He was up because he's a big Mets fan, too.  So, I look at him.  He looks at me.  I'm like, ah, what the hell?  I didn't even actually think it out.  But after the fact, I now realize it was just a bad.  Oh.  And we high-fived.  Well, all right.  Slow down.  Did you miss?  Did you catch the side of each other's hands and make it like a half-assed high-five, which  is the worst ever?  The best is that it's not like we both made eyes and was like, yeah, you know, and we 
[00:08:00]  both went up at the same time.  He's just like standing up with his hand out.  Oh, no.  Like, someone please high-five me.  So, I'm like, all right, now I have to do this because I can't just leave the boss  man hanging.  Oh, no.  I'm like, well, this is awkward, isn't it?  It's like an episode of The Office where the boss takes you to the game.  Come on, up top.  Come on, one up top.  We're here enjoying the game.  You want a hot dog?  Some people are calling it Opie's Brokeback Baseball. 
[00:08:30]  Well, there you have it.  Home run, home run.  Danny, hold me.  Oh, are they hammering you?  So, then Danny's like, yeah, you know, we did have that awkward home run high-five  moment there in the game.  I'm like, yeah, I guess.  Because it's not like me and the Oapster are hanging out every Friday night, going clubbing  and everything.  So, that was as comfortable as it was going to get.  Hot dogs, hot dogs, peanuts, peanuts, get your peanuts. 
[00:09:00]  That's bikini-tinis, bikini-tinis, two down here, two bikini-tinis.  All right.  All right.  Come on, up top.  All right.  Where you get, I love that, when you get the high two, it's like you miss and only two  of your fingers make contact with the other guy.  The slip, it doesn't make that snapping noise.  It's too bad we got to take a break.  It's awkward.  It's too bad we have to take a break.  Yeah, it's a shame.  Well, it's too bad, because the phones are just going nuts right now. 
[00:09:30]  Jim in Albany, what's up?  Hey, Opie, is dating hands as soft as Lindsay's?  I know.  How you mistake Lindsay's, like, Lindsay's got, like, elegant hands and those mitts that  you can only call, like, mitts.  What are you, Italian?  What are you?  Uh, actually, like, European, like, Russian Jew.  Russian Jew.  You got a little bit of everything.  Those working mitts.  See, the Jew part gives them soft hands.  Is that what it is?  Let's be honest. 
[00:10:00]  Let's be honest.  Money all your life, Mr. Hoover.  Let's be honest.  No, they did the old switch, so psychologically, I'm thinking I'm holding both of Lindsay's  hands.  Yeah.  You can see it my way, right, Ant?  Not at all.  What's wrong with Lindsay's right hand?  This is, ooh, I'm going to have to get her some lotion.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  You got bricklayer hands.  Charlie, make it fast.  Hopey and Anthony, how are you guys doing this morning?  Good, man.  All right, Charlie.  Hey, I got to say it's both, because day is funny.  Hey, after the half a high five, did you guys smack each other on the tush, too? 
[00:10:30]  All right, all right.  Did you give each other a little pat on the ass?  Look, I call no homo.  Simple as that.  Yeah, you got to.  Hey, but I want a lot of echo.  Can you put a lot of echo on me?  Hey, this is Lee Turgerson.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Do we want to razzle dazzle?  Do we want to do Big Kev's really interesting celebrity interviews?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  Well, we got Big Kev.  We could probably do both.  We got Big Kev here.  I mean, it's very rare to get the actual, the interviewer in studio when the riveting  interviews are being played.  And these are big celebrities.  I don't think they should wait.  Absolutely. 
[00:11:30]  These interviews.  Big Kev doesn't fuck around with his interviews.  I mean, he could take, Kev has a gift.  He could take any celebrity and just make them seen inane.  No offense.  No, none taken, I'm sure, right?  No.  Well, the beauty of the interviews are the fact that they're less than two minutes.  I mean.  He gets in another in-depth crap that some guys go for.  In and out.  This is Big Kev.  Do you acknowledge that you're Val Kilmer?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for talking to me today.  You should do that just for the fuck of it.  That'd be funny to hear. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  I'm down like a fucking jewelry store robbery.  It's a stopwatch.  We got two minutes.  So, Sam, tell me about this movie and go.  We should get Sam in here because the fireworks could fly.  Sam doesn't like your work there, Big Kev.  Oh, Sam.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Sam's saying you're not that good at interviewing.  I don't want to upset you, but Sam said that your stuff stinks. 
[00:12:30]  You know, and Sam would know.  Look at this kid.  There you go.  Apple-y cheeks.  Sweet disposition, you'd think.  Look, if it wasn't for me, you would have never known that someone thinks that you're  interviewing stinks.  Fiona Apple-y body.  That's up there.  He is a waif.  Those are just ideas that popped into my head when I was up.  Oh, don't be a pussy.  Don't be a pussy.  We know you have it in you.  Editorializing in the titles of the tracks.  I love it.  It's what you were doing. 
[00:13:00]  I love it.  Maybe.  All right.  Well, Big Kev.  How is he a black man, partially black man with lips, like a Vietnamese man?  Maybe part of the Vietnamese, too.  Same as thin lips.  But I hear he's all cock.  Got to respect this kid.  He's a good boy.  Have we figured out all of them yet?  We know we got the black.  Black and white.  We got the white.  We got the American Indian.  Right.  Yeah, I guess.  Part Jew.  Part Jew, I bet.  Oh, you got some Jew in you.  A little Jew.  A little bit, a little bit.  Yep.  None that I know of.  I see it.  I see it. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  It's there, I guess.  So young Sam finds Kevin detestable.  Yes.  Sam.  Paraphrasing.  What do you mean?  A lot.  What do you mean by this?  It says, Kev's been practicing his radio voice.  Well, Kev's voice was made fun of the last couple times he presented his interviews.  And it sounded like he's sort of getting that broadcast quality to it.  Ah.  Perhaps it's because of his numerous podcasts that he's been doing.  That's true.  Yes.  Sam is... 
[00:14:00]  Which you can listen to over at bigkevsgeekstuff.com.  That's a long name.  Bigkevsgeekstuff.com.  At least it's memorable, though.  Flows right off the tongue.  Sam is just better at it than Club Soda Kenny is.  Well, no.  I'm just saying that his voice seems to have a broadcast quality.  Well, why don't we listen in?  I'd like to say that...  Oh, boy.  The excuse before the interview.  This is the best part of the Big Kev interview experience.  I have a good one this time.  The Tuesday...  So this would be Friday and Saturday I did these interviews.  And on Tuesday that week I had five wisdom teeth out. 
[00:14:30]  So I was on the Oxycontin all that weekend.  Oh, drugged out interviews.  That was totally nice.  I thought we only had four wisdom teeth.  I had a mutant fifth one growing up in the top.  Are you shitting me?  No.  Well, I'll bring you the x-ray.  Wow.  Hey, can the boys get, like, all of Big Kev's excuses for next time?  That would be good.  Because he hasn't stopped before every time we do this segment.  Guys, it was jet lagged. 
[00:15:00]  Look, it's fucking C-Caucas.  Yeah, but I just...  Look, there were a lot of people that wanted time with the guy.  So, you know, I figured I only had a minute.  Hey, that actually developed very nicely into the interview.  That was an excuse, though.  Unit interviews.  You have many excuses.  Maybe we can find them real fast.  All right, here we go.  Let's see what old great white teeth had to...  Yeah.  Five wisdom teeth.  He pulled one out and it grew right back.  Sam writes in this first track, Big Kev has a boring conversation with Val Kilmer. 
[00:15:30]  It was really not interesting.  What's the matter?  It wasn't the questions.  Oh.  All right.  Well, the questions were terrific, you're saying.  That's what I'm saying.  Whatever it was.  Hey, this is Big Kev.  I'm at the National Comic Convention.  Oh, I hear a little bit of that radio voice.  Yeah.  The National.  The, by the way, National.  Not this local shit.  Big Kev with you.  National.  Where were the Bruins? 
[00:16:00]  Big Kev.  This was right across from Madison Square Garden to Penn Plaza.  Oh, do you like it?  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  BigAppleCon.com.  Oh.  Hey, this is Big Kev.  I'm at the National Comic Convention.  And I'm here with Val Kilmer.  Val, how are you?  Val.  Not bad.  How are you?  I'm good.  Val, tell us something about Deja Vu.  Deja Vu.  I'm having one right now.  It's as though we've met before, isn't it?  Deja Vu is a really great role.  He didn't want to play anymore.  He didn't want to play anymore.  He said, I'm having one right now. 
[00:16:30]  You, like, set him up to come back at you and do some kind of Deja Vu joke, and he just  didn't want to play.  Yeah, it's a movie about...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He said that in every interview, and you were the first guy to try to take it into, like,  a fucking Laurel and Hardy bit.  Kev wanted to make a seven-episode miniseries out of it.  Guy did one line, he's done eight times, and you're like, all right, let's go with that.  He's like, no, here's what he's about.  We will not be friends.  You're the interview. 
[00:17:00]  I'm the interviewee.  It's as though we've met before, isn't it?  Deja Vu is a really great role of people.  He totally didn't even acknowledge what you said.  There wasn't even, like, a nervous titter to make you feel a little more like, like,  uh, well, anyway, the movie is about just, like, you weren't even fucking speaking.  But let's listen.  Why don't we listen closely here again? 
[00:17:30]  Having one right now.  It's as though we've met before, isn't it?  Deja Vu is really great.  I've never heard somebody's eyes roll before.  It's as though we've met before, isn't it?  Deja Vu is really...  Holy shit, is that great. 
[00:18:00]  Not an inkling that you were even in the room.  It's as though we've met before, isn't it?  Deja Vu is a really great roller coaster.  It's a really fun movie.  And, uh, Tony Scott just never fails to deliver.  And I just heard the other night that Jerry Bruckheimer has amassed 50 billion dollars for  his employers.  Isn't that crazy?  That is crazy.  I mean, he really knows what people want to see. 
[00:18:30]  And it's just a really fun movie.  Can you tell us, just from a personal point of view, what it's like being recognized for  the great, one of the greatest Westerns ever, your performance as Doc Holliday in Tombstone?  I had such a great time.  My mom lives in Arizona and I love Kurt Russell.  And it's kind of a love story, you know, these two guys that couldn't be more different.  Doc Holliday is a guy that had his life and he knew he was going to die when he moved 
[00:19:00]  out west because he had tuberculosis.  And he met a man that was honorable and had brothers that he cared about.  So Doc Holliday found a family.  So it's a really moving story.  We saw it.  Jesus.  Ten-year-old movie.  Don't tell it real time, Val.  It's a true story and that's why people love it, I think.  Awesome.  That's Val Kilmer here at the National.  Wow.  Awesome may be overstating it a bit. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  Hey, that's one of my favorite movies.  It's one of the best performances I've ever seen in a film.  Yeah, I'm sure it's fantastic.  I was very excited to actually just get him to talk to say anything about it.  I don't blame you a bit, but Awesome, I'm saying may not have been.  How about bringing up Iceman in Top Gun?  Yeah.  When you clenched your teeth in the locker room.  I'm surprised you remembered his name.  I would have said awesome.  That was melatonin.  Wow, was he a bore.  Val Kilmer is a bore.  Ready for track two? 
[00:20:00]  Bring him on.  The Adam West interview.  Adam West.  Come on.  The original TV Batman.  This will be good.  No, I won't.  This is how it's labeled.  All the way.  How is it labeled?  This is how it's labeled by Sam here.  Adam West talks to Big Kev about his upcoming projects.  Listen for Kev's great seg and his attempts at humor.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  That doesn't mean jokes were good, by the way.  No.  When you say listen for someone's attempts at humor, that doesn't mean put your laughing  hat on.  Sam, comment. 
[00:20:30]  Well, Big Kev breaks the formula here from his minute interviews as he goes about two  minutes.  Wow.  And he really fills that time.  In depth.  Were the jokes good?  No.  No.  I didn't find them to be good.  I love that.  I love that.  Sam is coming out of his shell.  I didn't find them out of his shell.  What a fucking little creep he is.  Looks like a turtle out of his shell.  He certainly does.  Fucking little red-cheeked slug boy just shitting all over Big Kev.  I think Adam West, as a cultural icon, deserved two minutes instead of that. 
[00:21:00]  Well, Adam West, very recognizable.  Yeah, cultural icon.  A poor man's William Shatner.  Yeah, there you go.  Why don't we take a bit of a renaissance himself?  Here we go.  Hey, this is Big Kev at the National, and I'm here with superstar TV legend Adam West.  Adam, how are you?  Pretty good shape, Big Kev.  Adam, I hear that you have a bunch of up-  Superstar may not be good.  Yeah.  Do you realize the last time he was on television, blacks couldn't vote?  That's not true, Jim. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, all right.  Way to be literal with some humor.  Wow.  Now, what are the facts?  He actually has a reoccurring role in Family Guy, and he's going on the George Lopez show  this year, as he'll win the interview.  Again, as Jim said.  From being Batman to he'll be appearing on the George Lopez show.  And a cartoon.  It's a reoccurring character.  Back to you, Kev.  He's not on TV if he's a reoccurring character.  I like the volley here, but I think Jimmy just smashed one right down the sideline.  Well, when he said, no, I hate to disagree.  I'm like, okay, it must be some television roles. 
[00:22:00]  Well, he's on a cartoon, and he will be on the George Lopez show.  I bet you were heating up a little bit, because he also has a game show in development.  What's it called?  Who am I?  I suspect yes.  All right, let's...  After 40 years, it's no longer a hiatus.  He's off TV.  But, Kev, I don't want to be picky, but why the distortion in the interview?  You're a broadcaster at this point. 
[00:22:30]  I had a technical difficulty there.  It sounded loud there.  Was it loud?  It was loud.  So you might have been talking into the mic a little louder than you should have been over-modulating.  Yeah, he was getting really here.  He was pinning the needle.  Yeah, that didn't happen.  I didn't compensate enough.  That'll happen.  I'm learning.  Let's take a listen.  Hey, this is Big Kev at The National, and I'm here with superstar TV legend Adam West.  Adam, how are you?  Pretty good shape, Big Kev.  Adam, I hear that you have a bunch of upcoming projects.  Can you tell us about some of them?  Big Kev, I got a bunch. 
[00:23:00]  I hear you're going to be doing a reoccurring character on the George.  Wow.  What a doltz.  We're going to summarize, shitbox.  It's an interview, you fucking cocksucker.  Can you help me out here, Hendry?  I got a bunch.  Do you also have a bushel, you fucking farmer?  I've got a bunch.  I've got a metal project.  And his head was empty right then.  Oh, it's awful.  He's trying to think, what project can I say I have?  He gets into all of them.  Give him a chance.  All right.  Give him a chance.  To the project cave. 
[00:23:30]  Kev, let me look.  No, it's empty.  I hear you're going to be doing a reoccurring character on the George Lopez show.  Yeah, that's really fun.  You know, a lot of people, actors, others say, hey, that was fun to do.  You know, but many times work is not fun.  You know, you make it fun if you can.  But I got to tell you, George Lopez is a fun guy.  He's the greatest.  And he's a huge Batman fan. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  But we got along wonderfully.  And it was a good role and something I could get my comedic teeth into.  Shut up.  And you sink your comedic teeth into the role of the mayor.  Oh, no.  Oh, a segue.  That's a segue.  Wow.  Sink your comedic teeth.  And they ripped out with polydent strings going to the roof of his mouth.  I wonder if he had an extra fucking comedic tooth he had to have removed. 
[00:24:30]  Fucking, short of all, George Lopez looks like Burt Ward's cock.  I'm tired of him.  Someone off their cell phone.  Did anyone else notice that Adam West is a superstar, but Val is just...  Val.  Yeah.  Val.  Yeah.  Well, superstar.  And something I could get my comedic teeth into.  And you sink your comedic teeth into the role of the mayor on Family Guy.  Family Guy has been an amazing project.  You know, it's one of the only shows, or maybe the only one, that the fans ever brought back 
[00:25:00]  with just making a lot of noise.  Right.  And I think it really paid off.  I hear you also have an upcoming Disney movie.  Yes.  I did Chicken Little.  And now I'm doing Meet the Robinsons.  Right.  Here's a segue you could have used.  Speaking of little, you haven't been on television in quite a while.  What's been happening with your career?  I'm just thinking of different segues you could have used.  I'm taking mental notes. 
[00:25:30]  Whatever you want.  He was looking around for the bat signal to get out of this fucking interview.  Where's Commissioner Gordon when I need him?  I know.  You look...  Fuck.  You look over the clouds.  It's just a fucking head on a pillow with Z's coming at him.  I'm doing Meet the Robinsons.  Right.  You know, it's the Robinsons in space.  And I play Uncle Hal, an intergalactic delivery man.  And I understand you have a website also. 
[00:26:00]  Is that right?  Thank you for asking.  It's AdamWest.com.  You can buy an old cape, maybe, or whatever.  And I hear you're also developing a game show.  What?  I'm not at liberty to talk about it because we're waiting to see what happens with a couple  of the others that are now on.  Game shows are very chic.  Yeah.  What?  That could be the word.  And I don't know whether they're going to last.  Depressing and sad.  One of the greatest superheroes ever. 
[00:26:30]  And he's fucking going to be Chuck Woolery.  All right.  Well, he raped you on the date.  We'll send you back out with him.  One of the greatest superheroes ever?  Batman as a character?  Adam West?  Yeah.  Not that Batman.  No, no, no.  I mean, he played.  He's known.  Yeah, but that was a goofy send-up.  I don't mean that.  I don't mean he was the greatest as Batman.  I'm saying he's known as Batman.  Right.  He's Batman.  I don't give a fuck.  There's a lot of new guys.  He's a goofy TV Batman. 
[00:27:00]  Fine, but he's still Batman.  Okay.  You look at him, he's Batman.  I like him better than the other ones.  Superstar.  Yeah, but he's Batman.  Superstar.  That's what I say.  A dog shit sniffer from Woodside.  Kev should have kept his wisdom teeth.  That idiot.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Get those implanted back in.  Going to last.  But if we feel that they have any longevity, then I think we'll go for it.  Hey, if Shatner can do one, why not you? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, who?  Oh, you just put me in the best company there.  I mean, another icon.  Come on.  That is Adam West here at the National.  Wow.  That was the same delivery as Adam West dead at 74.  But that was like a send-off after somebody delivers a huge line.  You go, now that was Adam West.  But he went, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Company.  Company.  Launch here.  I'm shitting. 
[00:28:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, that was Adam West.  That doddering fool who's been turtling this entire interview was Adam West.  I was very proud and lucky to get that interview.  He didn't do any other press.  No, really?  After that, how could he?  All right.  Wait, was there a line to meet him?  There was.  The entire three days he was there, the line didn't stop.  Of course.  Yeah.  How'd you get up?  It was at a hole in the bathroom.  I talked to his people.  I actually didn't do that one until Sunday because I had to talk to his people for three 
[00:28:30]  days until we could find time to set it up.  All right.  Here we go.  Finally, the last track, Big Kev's really interesting celebrity interviews.  Big Kev talks with Dukes of Hazzard star Catherine Bach.  All right.  Give us a little background because we know Catherine Bach, the original Dukes of Hazzard from television.  She was the hot cousin, I guess.  Daisy Duke.  Daisy Duke, who the Daisy Dukes were actually named after.  Correct.  Jessica Simpson playing it in the movie with the little Daisy Dukes and stuff. 
[00:29:00]  We remember her beautiful ass on there.  But what's her name?  Barbara?  Catherine Bach.  Catherine Bach.  Barbara Bach was what?  Ringo's wife?  Yeah.  Catherine Bach.  So, gotta be hot, right?  Yeah.  Was she walking around in the Daisy Dukes?  In the Daisy Dukes guys just creaming?  No, she was not.  Oh, my God.  Daisy, yikes.  Look at this picture.  Oh, Jesus.  Daisy, Daisy douche.  Wow.  Did I fuck that up?  Daisy ate the dog Duke. 
[00:29:30]  Just sucked.  Wow.  I tried.  Me too.  Crash me, please.  No, what happened was, I bombed and you got hit with a fucking fallout.  Right.  There was nothing funny coming after that zero I dropped.  I'm on life support.  I'll just shove my cock in the grill of the Charger.  Jesus Christ.  And there it is.  That is horrid.  Back on track.  All right, well.  What happened?  So, no Daisy Dukes, huh?  I'm 20, what?  Was it 25, 27 years ago?  Well, stop eating the pie, okay?  That's right.  Remember you as a hot piece of ass. 
[00:30:00]  Make sure you can still fit into the Daisy Dukes.  Where are those cunt huggers, if I may?  That's what you should have said to her.  You should have been real polite and said, look, it's good to see you, but how does it  feel to know that so many American girls wear cunt-hugging shorts like you did?  When are you going to lose it, Big Kevin?  Ask the real question.  Yeah.  Real hard hitting.  Hey, you know, I don't want to lose these opportunities to bring you these.  Oh, this is just unbelievable opportunities.  They're all about the fluff.  They're all about the fluff. 
[00:30:30]  I don't want to lose Hollywood.  God, they're lining up at Best Buy to get their XM because of this.  He ought to do a show called Lack of Entertainment Tonight.  That's lovely.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right, here we go.  Listen for Kev not caring about her first answer as he moves to his second question.  Comments, Sam?  It just seemed like Kev had two questions in mind, and regardless of her first answer,  he was going for the second question.  You know, I have a format that I use, and, you know, we've got to stick to that format. 
[00:31:00]  Take the wig from fullblownaids.com just simply writes, Daisy pukes.  No, Daisy should puke a little more so she can get into her dupes.  She's a very nice older woman.  Older woman.  You should ask the real questions, though.  Like, where are those shorts?  I mean, come on.  The whole country's side.  Did you ever get a yeast infection from those things pushing up into your cunt?  I couldn't ask a question like that. 
[00:31:30]  How was that?  What was she wearing?  Was it anything sexy?  No, it was a nice...  A tracksuit, probably.  Like a pantsuit.  A pantsuit?  That famous Daisy Duke ass.  What does it look like these days?  It's easier to see.  There's a lot more of it.  Great.  Is that a pantsuit?  She's a very nice older woman, is what she is.  Time stinks.  Time does stink.  What's the worst question you would ask her, if you could?  Do you think that General Lee could jump over that fat ass of yours? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Why don't we just take a listen here?  All right.  Hey, this is Big Kev.  Of course.  I'm here at the National with TV hottie legend, Catherine Bach from the Dukes of Hazzard.  How are you, Catherine?  You had to say hottie legend.  TV slash legend.  He's not like Carson in 1978.  We're here with Catherine Bach. 
[00:32:30]  That's right.  She'll be sitting on Jim Fowler's shoulder.  She brings a falcon out, and it eats worms out of her cunt.  May your five wisdom teeth fall out.  I don't think she wanted to be called hottie legend.  No.  That means she's not a hottie anymore.  That means she's ready for the old-timers game.  Former legend, and now old fogey.  Why didn't you say, you know, the last time someone jerked off to you, 
[00:33:00]  Gerald Ford was falling down the steps.  There we go.  Hottie legend.  Oh, boy.  Hey, this is Big Kev.  I'm here at the National with TV hottie legend, Catherine Bach from the Dukes of Hazzard.  How are you, Catherine?  Hi, Kev.  I'm great.  How are you?  I'm great.  Thank you.  Old lady voice.  What are you up to these days?  Sounds ugly.  Old.  You know, I'm busy raising my family, which is, for all you women out there, you know how 
[00:33:30]  hard that is.  I'm doing that, but I'm loving it.  I've got a few projects.  I'm just, now that the kids are a little older, starting to get back to work.  I guess I started on the episode of Monk, on an episode of Monk.  Oh, you know what?  I remade the song, Waylon Jennings' song, Just a Good Old Boy, with John and Tom, my co-stars  from Dukes of Hazzard.  And that's going to be on CMT.  And it's also going to be...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She didn't get me that immediately. 
[00:34:00]  I need a copy of that.  You know she's going to be in the video, and they're only going to show her eyes.  Oh, yeah.  Two feet and two eyes.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's fucking finished.  John Schneider and Tom Wolpat and her are re-recording the theme to the Dukes of Hazzard, and it's  going to be played on the country music television.  Oh, boy.  Holy fucking disaster.  Wow.  And that's going to be on CMT, and it's also going to be the inner jacket of the new box 
[00:34:30]  set of DVDs.  Wow, that's awesome.  Can I ask you, how do you feel about Jessica Simpson's portrayal of the character?  Wow, that's awesome.  In other words, it's not awesome at all.  It couldn't be farther from awesome if it tried.  It's miles from awesome.  Wow.  Look, I have to keep the interview moving and keep my personal editorials out of it.  Awesome really gets overused.  Do you know you have to be in awe of something for it to be awesome? 
[00:35:00]  You were in awe of the fact that John Schneider, Tom Holpat, and Catherine Bach recorded the  theme to the Dukes.  I was in awe of shiny objects for four or five days.  So, that's great.  Uh, DJ Ain't a Lightbulb from Post Horse.  Big Kev should have asked her if she ever got her labia caught in her zipper.  Now, there's a good question. 
[00:35:30]  Now, that's what everyone wants to know.  Absolutely.  Oh, this is a hard-hitting question.  And then Redding from Whackbag is, Kev reading off cue cards, he is over-pronouncing every  word.  No, I'm trying to be a responsible broadcaster.  Yeah.  All right, well, here we go.  You should have said, uh, Catherine Bach, who played Boss Hog.  Really?  Thrower.  Just as a goof.  All right, I'm going to stop this next-  That one I might admit.  I'm going to stop this next, uh, question before the answer.  All right.  Awesome.  Uh, can I ask you, how do you feel about, uh, Jessica Simpson's portrayal of the character 
[00:36:00]  you created on the original Dukes of Hazzard?  Oh, I'm sure she feels just great about that.  I-  Let me think.  Being reminded how hot she used to be.  Let's guess.  Um, she didn't like it, uh, don't, don't, don't tell us, Kev.  Okay.  I'm saying she didn't really like it because it was a little too much, um, her character,  while it left more to the imagination, um, uh, Jessica Simpson character, a little too 
[00:36:30]  much exposed and a little too, uh, much feisty, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, I'm going to go into the opposite and say, I think she's going to say, I think she  did a terrific job.  She was really perfect as, I think she's going to be the Hollywood schmaltz.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  I hope in this question you at least refer to her as old lemon cunt.  I didn't see it.  So I, I don't really have a comment, but I do think that she seems like a, she didn't  see it.  She's going to schmaltz. 
[00:37:00]  What a liar.  I don't believe that.  I don't believe it.  She's going to schmaltz.  Wait, she wasn't in the movie, so she's bitter.  So now she's going to tell her she didn't see the movie.  Not as bitter as Cooter.  Cooter's real bitter.  He didn't like the movie at all.  He was boycotting it.  I find it really hard to believe that they didn't at some point.  It's been out on DVD forever now.  I find it really hard to believe that none of them, because according to, uh, what she  told me after the fact, as far as she knows that not really none of the people have seen  it all the way through or they were sent clips or something like that.  That's such a lie.  I don't, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  That's a lie.  Liar, liar.  Big fat pants on fire.  Let's say they do a movie about, uh, the, the Opie and Anthony show, but, but they don't  invite us to do a cameo in it.  Exactly.  We're much older and stuff.  We're going to sit at home and not watch the Opie and Anthony movie.  I wouldn't.  You think I don't want to see how Tom Cruise plays me?  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to laugh too hard.  Be hurtful if I laugh too hard.  Here's the answer.  Dan, so I, I don't really have a comment, but I do think that she seems like a sweet girl. 
[00:38:00]  Why didn't you see the movie?  I haven't had a chance.  Everybody out there that has kids and, uh, and a busy life knows it's not that easy.  Catherine Bach, very busy lady.  Thank you so much.  Wait, you have kids?  And, uh, I'm going to be looking for this.  You don't have time to watch a movie?  You'll find it.  You know, lying cunt.  Don't have time to watch a movie because she's raising kids?  What are they, monkeys?  She's the lie.  They're shitting and throwing it at her?  She's just a duck?  And they put feces in my VCR? 
[00:38:30]  She's lying.  She certainly is.  All right, Big Kev, there you go.  I have to give her butthole a good fingering her.  Straighten her right out.  Daisy Duke.  Give her a good buggering.  What are the next interviews?  Uh, we have a break now until January.  Oh, no.  What's coming up next?  So, where, where is, uh, the one in January?  Oh, there's, there's several.  There's, uh, a chiller theater, Dead of Winter show coming up.  There's, uh...  Any, uh, prospects who's gonna be there?  There's some.  I don't wanna give away anything.  Oh, no. 
[00:39:00]  To please.  And, uh, there's also, uh, another, uh, Big Apple con coming up as well as the, uh, the  New York Comic Con, which is the biggest con.  That's the biggie?  On the East Coast.  I don't know exactly who's gonna be there, but it should be somewhere.  I love that it's called a con, because that's exactly what the fuck it is.  Convention.  We ought to go to one of these.  What do you say?  I think you need to go to chiller in the spring.  I think that is the one that you guys should go to.  Me?  Oh.  No.  Jimmy?  No.  We all go?  Jimmy will definitely go.  I think we all go. 
[00:39:30]  No.  We have some fun.  We bring some recorders.  No.  No.  I'll go.  No.  Have a little fun?  No.  Jimmy had a ball.  I did have fun.  I took Jimmy.  I really did.  Did he?  Yeah.  Usually he has two.  Right in his mouth.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Well.  He got pictures and he met people and actually people wanted pictures with him, which was  very funny.  That's something.  Aaron.  Aaron Moran.  Aaron Moran.  Joni Happy Days.  Joni from Happy Days.  Big Jimmy Norton fan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear she. 
[00:40:00]  I'm chewing my almonds.  Nutty as a fruitcake.  Oh, yeah.  Let's take a break.  I'm chewing my almonds.  Oh, is she a fan of the show?  You're listening to The Word.  I will be in Anthony.  Anybody working for the show today?  Could you find the Merv Griffin article, please?  Yeah, look it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Merv.  I used Dave to stall.  I'm tearing down all sorts of walls today.  I need the article.  But basically, you probably figured out by now, one of his conquests was River Phoenix.  Merv Griffin, according to this fucking article.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Really?  Wow, very cool.  This, this. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I felt like Jimmy reading this article.  I wanted to be in a bathroom puking.  How did he get such a young boy?  You gotta, I gotta read it word for word, just how, it just will make you nauseous.  He's a very powerful guy, man.  Merv Griffin could fucking, he left the room at a party and said something like, uh, mission  accomplished or something.  Oh.  He said, exactly.  Maybe he just wanted to eat his ass.  Huh?  Maybe he didn't want to fuck River.  Maybe he just wanted to eat his ass.  I bet you that's what he wanted to do. 
[00:41:00]  He probably saw my own private Idaho and he just wanted to.  That's exactly it.  He probably wanted to bend him over.  I bet you he wanted to open River's asshole and just go like this.  And breathe Merv breath onto River's bag.  From the back.  There's an article about Merv's secret gay life in the February 11th issue of the National  Enquirer.  Yes.  Okay.  This will be good enough.  Griffin's close friend and personal psychic, John Cohan claims Merv was gay and he personally  witnessed Griffin seduce River Phoenix after plying him with alcohol at a party around 
[00:41:30]  1991.  So River Phoenix was fucking young, man.  Yeah.  He said Merv was instantly smitten with the younger man, having seen him in the film,  My Own Private Idaho.  Very good, Jimmy.  In which River played a gay street hustler.  Merv said, I want to meet him.  He was like an excited teenage boy.  That was, Merv was an excited teenage boy.  I'm sure he was.  River Young.  River was literally an excited young teenage boy.  He probably had a liver spotted cock. 
[00:42:00]  I'm working out a really gross line, but I'll tell you what I have so far.  All right.  You know, River Phoenix was shaking outside the Viper room.  I'm thinking now that he was trying to shake the Merv Griffin semen out of his asshole.  Probably not anywhere.  Let me just give him a little comedy tip.  There's no way to clean that up.  No, no, no.  There's no way to make that Leno friendly.  How do you say shake cum out of the asshole, Jay?  But network friendly?  It wasn't that I was going for a cleaner line, Jimmy.  I was going for a line that maybe more people would have laughed at. 
[00:42:30]  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to work it to be maybe funny.  Okay.  So Cohen said, toward the middle of the evening, Merv comes over to me and says, I'm going to  take a drink to River.  I said, well, go easy.  He's a fragile young kid.  Watch it with the liquor.  As the evening wore on, Cohen claims he saw River and he said, Merv's giving me a lot  of drink.  I shouldn't be drinking this much.  It was clear Merv was trying to get him drunk and he succeeded.  Bet you Merv just wanted to suck his cock. 
[00:43:00]  I bet you that's what Merv wanted.  I bet you Merv didn't want to fuck him in the ass.  I bet you Merv just wanted to fucking like, look, just slide your jeans down to the middle  of your legs.  And he probably took his warm, older gentleman hands and he probably cupped River's balls.  And his dick was soft because he'd been drinking and he wasn't gay.  But Merv popped that fucking cock and sucked like fucking gay guys suck.  Like it was like a like a fucking like a playmate.  I think Merv made piglet noises while he was fucking suckling, Jimmy. 
[00:43:30]  No, I don't.  You don't need the noises.  You don't need a prop.  OK, no, he was probably.  I bet you he didn't grab the dick.  He probably just held those young balls.  Older, older man nose hitting belly on every fucking dollar.  Merv couldn't help it.  Merv probably came before he was hard.  He was probably getting hard and shooting.  Merv came out.  Merv swallowed it all down.  Of course.  Mm.  Not only did Merv swallow it, he went, mm.  And then he would fucking squeeze the balls and try to milk another dropout as if it was 
[00:44:00]  liquid gold.  Ew.  Merv came out from one of the rooms and he was smiling and he said, mission accomplished.  Yeah.  Cohen asked Merv later, why did you get him so drunk and do that?  Merv said, oh, he's just so adorable.  I couldn't resist.  Maybe he just kissed him.  Maybe he just wanted to fucking like lick his nipples or something or smell under his  arms.  No, he probably did exactly what you said.  Sucked his dick?  Yeah.  Cupping and making the sound. 
[00:44:30]  I could do anything you need me to do.  I bet you while he cupped, he flipped his finger.  He slipped his older gentleman finger under and tickled his asshole.  And River probably wasn't that used to having that done.  And River was probably laying on the back stiff.  Like, all right, I'll just cut in his mouth real quick and get another movie.  Like really sloppy and really fast.  Today's instant feedback winner, I just decided to start a new bit today, is Rod Jay.  I don't give a shit what we've read up to this point. 
[00:45:00]  He writes, he's from Colorado Springs.  He writes, Merv attacked River like Iraq attacked sliders.  Hey, the article also says Merv had affairs.  Okay.  Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson, Montgomery Cliff, and some guy named Gardner McKay.  And it also says Merv's marriage to Julianne Elizabeth Wright was a sham to cover up his  sexuality. 
[00:45:30]  Was it?  So there you go.  You fucking, uh, I bet you, uh, I bet you when River started coming, Merv gripped both  River's legs because he was as excited to be taking a mouthful.  Like, as he was coming, Merv probably grabbed his legs and went.  Oh, God.  He didn't spill a drop.  Jimmy, yeah.  Old Merv just.  Jimmy, it seems like you know a lot about, uh, cock sucking.  He's like, no, no, here's what, Merv treated River's cock. 
[00:46:00]  Are you creeping out the, uh, the audience on the stand?  No, no, no.  Don't misunderstand.  Okay, all right.  Merv treated River's cock the way anyone would want their cock treated.  Very good.  You know?  And that's how I would want my cock treated, just not by Merv.  Like what?  No, not by Merv.  How would you like your cock treated?  I want the balls cupped.  And I want it really sloppy.  And I want the hand and the mouth working together like this.  And then I want the one, the jack-in-hand to go, and he just holds the balls. 
[00:46:30]  And his mouth, I bet you his lips would open really wide, like, and he would gobble the  cock.  Like his fucking mouth, his mouth would clear the cock on both sides.  Wowee.  And his lips, his fucking lips would brush like River's pubic area and then clamp down  on the shaft.  Hey, um, you think Merv Griffin, um, uh, do you think Merv liked cocked him?  No, I don't think Merv liked cocked him. 
[00:47:00]  Why?  What?  He loves it!  Come on!  Merv loved cock!  We haven't done many catchphrases today.  I know that was like a seal thing, but.  Uh, all right, uh.  He got him drunk!  He bought him liquor, Sam!  Oh, no, Jimsy!  That's right, there was botulism in it.  This is tantamount to Merv!  His cock was wet, Sam!  You know whose saliva it was? 
[00:47:30]  Merv!  He took that young boy, and he kissed his balls, Sam!  And they were bigger than yours when he was five!  Because you're Asian, you have tiny genitals.  I should have cut this one two lines ago, Sam, but I got greedy.  The audience is loving it, though.  They love Jimsy.  Who doesn't?  Can you at least give him the facial expression?  Just give him a little treat today, Jimmy.  It was murder! 
[00:48:00]  See?  They love it, Jimmy.  Because they see the back of their head, unfortunately.  You're listening to the worst.  It sucks a pile of cock.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, shit.  Guys tell all the truth about sex in relation.  Yeah, I'm sure that paints men in a good light, right?  Yeah.  The Chinese cunt in the middle.  Anyways.  She's very sexy, but she's got a deeper voice than me.  Why don't we get a little of this?  The one on the left looks like a fucking guy.  Guy in drag.  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, my God.  Carrie's pretty hot, man.  We're not even in drag. 
[00:48:30]  That is a guy.  Oh, my God.  It's Michelle Obama.  Don't be working your traps some more, you dyke.  We're watching the Today Show.  Did you see her with that sweater on a couple weeks ago?  I think she's a beard for him.  I really don't.  Yeah, yeah.  She's beautiful.  Why don't you, Gay?  Yeah.  Very hot.  But she had a voice like this.  Next up, chicken salad recipes.  Do you like nuts and celery in them?  I'm going to give you a good firm stool.  We'll be right back.  This woman looks like John Leguizamo. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  With a wig on.  Yes.  Say hello to fucking Scott LaRose.  What is this crap?  Oh, God.  Look at this.  This is what they picked to speak for men.  Marriage.  There you go.  Andy.  Andy, Andy.  Many years.  You've got many years.  16 years married.  So many years.  Yes.  Tell me.  What do you do?  Well, you know, spark is spark.  You know, when you're hot, you're hot.  Yes.  When you're not, you're not.  You know, but it's all about communication.  It is not.  It's all about communication. 
[00:49:30]  When I married my wife.  Because I'm gay with sperm in my mouth.  Yeah.  Get home and diddle, you fucking clit.  Isn't a guy saying that?  Wednesday is good.  Wednesday is very, very good.  Today is Tuesday, which means tomorrow.  It is about communication.  I'm a hard dick.  And I've fucking realized that the person that you are married to is still that beautiful  woman or for women.  And even though you're a gay man, you have to remember, you're a woman as much as you  do or as much as you wanted to back in the day.  So now you have to keep doing the things. 
[00:50:00]  We're not talking about rape.  Are you still romancing them?  I'm liking, liking, liking.  Yes, I do.  I try to be creative.  You know, I try to do stuff like sometimes.  Sometimes I suck a man's penis.  Is that a turn on?  Try to mix it up all the time.  And pretend it's like.  If no one else enjoys it, I had a good time.  And she's had a laugh.  When we were at the back talking just before we came on air and we were talking about the  happy stewards, son.  Yeah.  We're not going to talk about the wigs and the lingerie. 
[00:50:30]  We're going to say it.  You're wearing it at the back.  Let me ask you guys.  Are you guys romantics?  I mean, when you show up, I don't know, whether it's a date or whether it's to your girlfriend,  do you come with the flowers and the chocolates?  Please say it's a hike.  Do you go into the romance part?  I mean, I'm a chef, so I've got to be.  It's got to be about food.  It's got to be about nice wines, candlelight, you know, a bit of, I sort of think romance comes  from a situation.  It really does.  It comes from a date rape drug.  I just had this conversation with my girlfriend. 
[00:51:00]  They're all gay!  I know, they're all gay!  That's who speaks for us today.  It's why I'm a fucking hateful, heterosexual.  It's not about the sex all that much.  It's about how they feel.  So our biggest thing.  It's the little love notes.  It's the flowers.  I see what's important to them, what their goals, what their dreams are.  I left my wife a love note.  What makes them important to us.  Pick up the trash in that bag.  Women also take a little longer to warm up.  So guys, we're always ready.  Because, see, we're just, we don't know. 
[00:51:30]  It's like, so we need to be ready at a moment's notice.  Yeah.  For what?  To bust into a condom?  Well, they realize that women aren't always ready.  So we've got foreplay.  Take it slow.  Foreplay is whatever is leading up to sex.  It might be in the morning when you leave the house.  What do you know, wrinkle-neck thing?  And you go out and you call it during the day.  This should be called guys tell nothing.  I like that.  They tell all.  This is what passes, Sarah says.  You know, after 16 years, you know, there's a lot of just life intruding all the time. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  So, yeah, sex is easy.  The romance can be hard.  Yeah.  Pardon the pun.  And, oh, Dick Joe.  How the fuck about Dick Joe?  We weren't even going there.  We weren't even going there.  We were going to find ways all the time to reinvent ourselves to keep things fresh.  Is the glasses the latest one?  All right.  Let's take a look at our next question.  This is from Whitney from New York.  She asks, what happens after you hook up on the first date?  Let's take a look at her question.  You know, the cops come to my house and go, where's the head?  My question is, if you hook up with a guy on the first date, is there potential for it to go somewhere? 
[00:52:30]  Or was it just a one-night stand?  How do men feel about the woman next day, the day after?  A single guy.  I kind of felt like this was coming my way.  You know, look, I personally wouldn't judge somebody, whether they hooked up with you on the first date or not.  I think that every situation is different.  You know, it depends on how it came about.  Did you meet her in a nightclub and then end up back at her?  How about if she wiped her ass on your towels before she left?  And when you judge her, you fucking fag.  Trent, you have a little bit of a different point of view on that, right? 
[00:53:00]  No.  No?  Yeah, I believe that it can turn into something.  You know, I'm just into a very natural, innocent sort of flow of a relationship.  Are you?  You fucking fag.  It's like your brother's like a fucking white gay douche.  Maybe she did that yesterday.  I mean, isn't that kind of propping up in your head?  I think it has a lot to do with the self-esteem and maturity of the man.  Yeah.  And also, like you said, the situation.  Go warm up my car.  It's the type of situation where you're out on a date and it ends up going very well. 
[00:53:30]  It just naturally progresses to the point where you wind up going further than you expected on the first date.  That's a different story than if you had a frat party back and, you know, down in alcoholic beverages.  And then you wake up the next morning and you don't remember how you got there.  We had an interesting segment on yesterday with you and we were talking about sexlessness.  Yeah.  I'm so scared about a relationship that doesn't lead to sex right away.  It's disgusting.  It should never happen.  Oh, yeah.  Wow. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  It's easy there, guys.  Sometimes the longer you wait, the better it is.  Oh, is that right?  Like forever.  You must wait a long time, you fat fart.  If they know that there truly is a sexual compatibility.  Now, if you're expecting a guy that needs to be totally cold turkey and go into a serious relationship with you.  You met all your girls who are DNA database.  I don't ever have any kind of sexual contact with you.  That's how we trace our relationship.  He never had sex before he gets there.  I can't believe I'm married with someone. 
[00:54:30]  There are so many ways to connect on.  Like for women, for us, we connect on so many different levels.  Is that right?  You're so complex.  Guys, it seems like you're going to split your head with a fucking ear.  That's a measure of a relationship.  We connect on so many levels.  The fucking wallet and the cunt.  Yeah.  You're a real fucking enigma.  Oh, yeah.  You're trying to cut with a dick.  That's what you want, you stupid.  And there's so much more than you want.  We're so complicated.  Somebody lays a complexity, you fucking cunt.  You want your cunt and your money. 
[00:55:00]  Both, so try to figure that out.  When somebody cooks for you, you go out of their house, and the first thing you do is you smell what they've cooked.  You get a big side of the anticipation of the meal.  Yeah, nothing gets me harder than fucking eggs over easy.  You know, sex, I don't think it's just an act.  I think it's something more than that.  It's something really special.  And it's something to share with people.  It's a dick in my fucking ass.  All day.  But when you're having sex in a committed relationship, it's much more intense. 
[00:55:30]  Listen to this fucking, this guy, no better sexual guy would ever say that, ever, in a million fucking years, ever.  I've been in relationships where sex came later on.  Again, let's not bring the fucking place into this.  If I knew that we were sexually compatible.  Yeah, but we're talking about consensual sex.  He said sex in a committed relationship is so much more.  And there's so many ways to communicate.  That guy, he's a phony.  He's never seen a snatch in his life.  No, he hasn't.  Never.  Sure.  But it's just that most guys aren't going to really go for that. 
[00:56:00]  Again, we're talking about consensual sex.  Even if he is waiting for you, he may not be waiting.  He's like, well, I won't have sex with you, but I will have some sex.  Okay, we're moving on.  Yeah, yeah, very feminine.  To another great point.  I respect your wishes.  You know, that guy knows when the state's over, that somebody blows up rape with someone.  Anita from New York asks about how she can tell the guy is lying to her about having sex with other women.  Your point.  Let's take a look.  I'm wondering, how do you tell if a man is lying about sleeping with other women if he says they're just friends? 
[00:56:30]  If his crotch smells like a blimpy.  Let's go.  How can you do that?  Go ahead.  Brett?  Women have a very strong shot.  Why would it matter to you, you ugly whore?  And they know when something's up.  And it's very simple.  If you can see sort of the inconsistencies.  No, they don't.  I've cheated my whole life.  You're fucking dumb as a bag of hands.  Wrench your dick.  Go home and go, hey, I'm going to watch a ball game.  Fucking stop it.  If you suck his dick and there's shit on the tip, chances are he's been with someone else or he tripped.  Yeah, let's ask Bo Jackson's younger brother. 
[00:57:00]  That's stupid.  How do you guys hide being gay from your wives?  Whether he is on or he isn't on.  Yeah, that's the question, exactly.  And that relationship is doomed.  That's the trust.  It's all about the trust.  And if you have to ask the question, you will probably already have your answer.  Because even, you know, like you said, even if the answer is no, the fact that he has asked the question shows a lack of trust.  And there's so many other things that are probably going to happen. 
[00:57:30]  It's all on your mind, bitch.  Well, sometimes it may be coming from another relationship.  When he comes home saying pepper spray.  She knows he's been cheating.  That's all I'm watching his face.  Are you playing with a little chat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You see a sketch of him on fucking the local news?  Have you seen this man ask him to give him a vagina back?  Why dismembered tense in his sock drawer?  Why men think they're the only ones. 
[00:58:00]  They can be the only ones to have sex, casual sex without attachment, and women can't.  Well, you need to.  I kind of have.  Yeah, go, go.  I'm so sick of this question.  Did that lady leave her number?  This guy's out of control.  Oh, how the fuck are you?  He's the bad boy.  Yeah.  Because he's wearing a ripped hoodie.  He thinks he's Rod fucking Stewart.  When guys are out having casual sex, I think that we have a healthy understanding that women do the same thing.  But are those the kind of girls that you're building a lasting relationship? 
[00:58:30]  Yes, you do.  That's the thing to remember.  There is double sand.  Because when I look at a woman, and they're kind of being like that, very casual.  You don't like that, do you, faggot?  The wholeness, pureness of them are gone.  You don't want them for the long haul.  I don't want them to be the mother of my children.  I don't want them for the mother of my children.  Some girl licks my asshole the first day, I'm getting her a ring within an hour.  I want to use her as a cum sputoon for the next 40 years.  Next time she licks your asshole, there's a little ring in there.  Hey, lick my asshole. 
[00:59:00]  Do it again.  She sticks and talking to her.  What is that?  Oh, I love you.  She's crying.  How romantic.  It's shit on the ring still.  It's two carrots and a piece of corn.  My wife is on the road with major rock and roll.  Oh, okay.  It's like, I'm about to believe it.  I don't care about what you did before me.  As a matter of fact, don't hurt me.  Don't tell me.  Don't even tell me.  Okay, wait.  Can I see you guys?  Do you promise to come back again for our next segment? 
[00:59:30]  So great.  You guys are great.  And we come back while you may want to use those gift cards that you got for Christmas  today, right after these messages.  Yeah, that's stressing.  Wow.  Drivel.  How the fuck am I not a trillionaire?  I don't understand.  The whole gay guy is talking for a second.  There's another white man being betrayed while in a commercial.  There you go.  It's like a carrot.  It's like that movie, American Beauty. 
[01:00:00]  Remember that movie?  Oh.  Where they got Kevin Spacey playing the man.  Heterosexual, yeah.  And he's in love.  He wants to fuck.  He's fantasizing about fucking a cheerleader in high school.  Right.  And the way they represent this in this gay movie.  It really was.  This fucking bunch of come through a projector that this movie was.  This is a fucking...  This is a man...  According to this movie, when you fantasize about a cheerleader, you lay on your back 
[01:00:30]  and flower petals fall all over you.  Right, right.  Rose petals just fall all over your body.  That's what you're thinking about.  Yeah.  Instead of just like her hot, sweaty ass.  Yeah.  And the confused look on her face.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  As you fucking cum in her stupid eye.  And then bash her brains in with her own pom-poms wrapped around your fist.  Hold her throat and tell her not to tell people.  And you throw her into her cab and she's crying.  Yeah, exactly.  You fucking bleach your hair and move out of town.  Or you yell, give me a C, give me a U, give me an N, give me a T, as you punch her in 
[01:01:00]  the belly.  No rose petals needed.  Avoid her calls when she skips her period a fucking month later.  She's holding a middle of light on her eye to put down the swelling.  When it's done, I want the sheets to look like it.  She's got a rose petals on it.  Exactly.  Are you spotting her to wear a fucking sewer shiner?  You make her wear a fucking cheerleading outfit while you give her ass to mouth.  Exactly. 
[01:01:30]  God.  No, it's Kevin Spacey with this sweet look on his face and his flower petals.  Yeah.  And also like cluck music, you know, jazzy music.  Yeah.  Music with a...  Yeah, that's how you fantasize.  With those wooden blocks.  And then the Marine at the end of the movie, the Marine, of course, the ex-Marine is really...  Yeah, he's the one who's really gay.  None of us are gay.  It's actually that one hetero guy.  He's the gay one.  Yeah.  No one else is gay.  Yeah.  Kevin Spacey's not gay.  Yeah, no.  Fuck.  He's fucking straight as an arrow.  He lifts weights, listens to Zeppelin, drives a Firebird, and thinks about fucking rose 
[01:02:00]  petals.  Yeah, the rose petals really...  And then when he actually sees her tits, he almost vomits.  Yeah.  And puts a blanket around her.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is the fucking man?  There's no man there.  No.  Absolutely not.  She should have been in a chokehold.  He finally sees the 18-year-old tits and goes, what have I been doing all the time?  I forgot.  I forgot.  I like men and their anathus.  I forgot.  I like to suck a cock.  I don't like vaginas.  They're disgusting.  Hey, this is Louis C.K.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony, and I don't know what else you're doing, 
[01:02:30]  but I hope you die soon.  The virus.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's E-Rock from Opie and Anthony.  And Sam from Opie and Anthony.  And this is The Worst of Opie and Anthony, and we're joined by comedian Jim Jeffries.  Hello.  A comedian who you've heard on The Opian Anthony.  Yes.  Jim.  It's obvious the show's on vacation, so they left us here to take care of this crap.  Where am I right now? 
[01:03:00]  I must be.  I think I'm in Australia.  This bit here is you telling us about your fear of bananas.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm scared of bananas.  You want me to elaborate on it?  I've just always been scared of bananas my whole life, and I can't actually give you  a reason why.  I'm just terrified of bananas.  It's just bananas, but also I can bear to be around things that smell like bananas.  Well, I can't really, but I won't vomit if there's something like that involved.  But if there's an actual banana, or if it's got brown skin or something like that, I won't 
[01:03:30]  be in the same room as a banana, but I can just do it if it's still in its casing.  But if someone's eating it, I'll walk out.  So it's worse if it's a peeled banana?  If it's a peeled banana, just saying it there, peeled banana, is even making me shiver.  Is it, do you have like a texture kind of thing?  Are you one of those guys that has a problem with certain foods, just the way it feels?  No, no, I'm not a picky eater.  I'm not a fussy guy, but no, that, I can see fuckers putting their teeth into that. 
[01:04:00]  Just like the softness of it, and the way it kind of squishes when you bite it?  The reason why I ask is because our own Sam here has texture issues when it comes to food.  Yeah, but I won't leave the room.  No, but you can't eat it.  You can't eat rice, you can't eat steak.  You can't eat rice and steak?  No.  Well, you're afraid of bananas.  Yeah, but it's fucking steaks.  Like, rice is a staple food.  Yeah, but I can look at it.  Yeah, but you can't eat steak?  No.  Not any type of beef?  Can you eat ground beef?  No, I always gag.  I'll put it in my mouth, but I'll gag. 
[01:04:30]  Can you eat ham?  No.  Pork?  Only bacon.  Can I eat bacon?  Only bacon.  So you're like a bizarro Muslim.  Yeah.  You're the opposite.  You're like a non-Jew.  Yeah.  Like the thing that you just eat bacon.  Yeah.  I can only eat it if it's not kosher.  All right, well, let's check out the story.  Something completely unrelated to my eating habits.  Yes, Jim Jeffries being afraid of bananas here on The Worst of Opian Anthony.  What the fuck is this? 
[01:05:00]  You're listening to The Worst.  What the fuck is this?  The Worst of Opian Anthony.  My mum, I had a friend commit suicide a while back.  It sounds a cheery thing, but I had an argument with her before she committed suicide that  day.  I rang my mum up, and I go, I said some awful things, mum.  And she goes, well, James, in your life, you're going to say hurtful things to people  that you don't mean, but you just try to, you know, minimise these things so they don't  happen again, right?  And she goes, I'm just happy. 
[01:05:30]  I've said some awful things in my life, but I'm just happy that I never said anything bad  to you or your brothers.  And I'm like, what did you do when you left the house?  Were you just like stabbing people in the street or something?  Last time I was home, I got woken up by this 400-pound woman bashing into my room going,  I want you to know that when I'm dead, in many ways, you've been a huge disappointment to  me, and the reason for that is, the reason for that is because I didn't show her some  photos, and I showed them to my dad, oh, she's mental, she used to beat the hell out  of me.  I got scars on my, on my side. 
[01:06:00]  Really?  She used to hit me with a belt buckle from a scout belt, right, because I wouldn't go  to scout.  The reason I wouldn't go is I was being molested every day I was there.  Oh my God.  Oh, wow.  And she goes, why won't you go?  I go, I don't want to go.  Boom.  You must have been an adorable little kid.  Now it explains all the stories you told us yesterday.  Yes, it does.  Right, Jimmy?  Now we understand why you do what you do sexually.  I heard MySpace messages, just a row of 20 when I got back to the hotel yesterday that 
[01:06:30]  just said, gay.  You got molested at Boy Scouts?  At Scouts, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he never actually physically inside or anything.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Well, was that all right, you think?  Yeah.  Probably not.  He used to just put me in a corner and, anyway, it wasn't a good day.  Either way, you look at it.  It wasn't a good day either.  What would he just, was he into just looking at you and-  The thing is, he always wanted you to call him Baloo through the whole experience. 
[01:07:00]  He never lost his, you know, seniority from the jungle book.  What did he make you do?  You got to kind of keep it like sort of vague.  But we'll figure it out.  A lot of swearing and sitting in the corner and, and like, it was like being in the front  row at SeaWorld.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, God.  When Shamu flips up in the air and then, caution, you may get wet, is what they say. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, when Shamu-  That was the, that was the best way I could describe it on one morning radio.  I thought that was pretty good, the way I danced around there.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, God.  So this was going on at Scouts.  You go home and now you decide, you know, it's in my best interest not to go back there  anymore.  And now you're getting-  It was Cubs, actually.  And now you're getting beat by your mom because you won't go to Scouts to get molested, basically. 
[01:08:00]  Mom used to thrash me with the belt buckle of the Scout belt.  When the hell did this happen?  And those Scout belts, they're like, they're like those big buckles and everything.  It wasn't nice.  In the end, my dad found out.  I tell this, I tell this a little bit in my routine, but I'll mention it anyway.  In the end, my dad found out, I swear to God, this is what he said.  He comes to me and he goes, I went with me mate who it also happened to, and my dad said,  you've done the right thing by coming to see us.  And I want you to know that you've done nothing wrong and he's done everything wrong and he's 
[01:08:30]  going to get what's coming to him.  And then my dad hugged me and looked at me and went, I wonder how you got all those badges.  And people think I made that up.  Oh, wow.  But I swear to God, that's true.  And the thing is, I respect my father so much for that because I believe comedy is  all about taking risks.  And my father was holding his molested child and he thought, no, it's a good one.  Have a go.  Maybe I'll get a love.  I've got a good joke here.  I'm just going to let this one fly.  I'll just work it in.  Did you laugh?  No, I didn't really get it.  I can promise you, later on that evening, he was in the pub with his mates going, and 
[01:09:00]  then I said.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say good morning to Cleveland.  We've got Pete on the line.  Pete.  That is true.  Pete, what's up?  Dude, that's awesome.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  All right.  I've been lingering longer, and you guys were playing, I don't know, it was when you were  on vacation or something, they did a replay, and Bob Kelly was in the studio with you guys,  and he was talking about, he did this set, and there was this guy that was in the waiting 
[01:09:30]  room with him that was, like, deathly afraid of something.  And it turned out it was Jim Jeffries.  This was a long time ago, and I guess you guys all forgot about it.  Hmm.  What is he afraid of?  Bananas.  Oh, yeah.  No, I don't.  I don't like bananas.  In fact, there's a pill over there that I've already...  How did you...  How did you...  No, don't do that.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  Seriously, it's open.  Don't...  Don't...  Don't screw with him. 
[01:10:00]  Wait, what is this about?  He's actually leaving the studio.  I don't like bananas.  I don't...  I don't like bananas.  I'm just holding up the...  Why?  Are you doing a bit?  No, I'm serious.  Put it back, Opie.  Don't make the guest uncomfortable.  No, no, put it back.  I don't like it when it's open like that.  Like this?  Yes, don't do that.  All right, what is going on?  Put it back, and we will ask, and maybe there's an explanation.  Wait, wait, this is like kryptonite.  Look at this.  Watch it.  No, don't make our guest uncomfortable.  Don't, don't, don't open it. 
[01:10:30]  No, seriously, it's so funny.  Wait, do those things open look like what a Scoutmaster's trousers look like?  All right, it's just got to...  Put it back.  Put it back.  Hold on.  It's got to be said that I just...  He saw my banana over here.  I eat a banana and yogurt every morning.  This guy just said that he's deathly afraid of bananas, and he pointed at my banana.  I picked it up.  I just started showing it to him, and he's moved away.  How did that guy know I didn't like bananas?  Are you talking about bananas?  I guess Bob Kelly had said it once.  Wait, this is a real moment. 
[01:11:00]  What's up?  I have a thing with bananas.  All right, you're going to tell us after the break.  This is the tease right now.  Wait.  Who's turning off the channel right now?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  If I shut my eyes, I can't see it.  So do what you want.  You can feel it, though, right?  No, no, no, no.  Just feel the banana.  No, I'm not going to touch the banana.  Please, just feel it.  I'm not going to touch you.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Why would you do that?  How weird is it, though?  Look at him.  He doesn't like...  People don't like balloons.  Some people don't like baked beans.  Some people don't like clowns.  I don't like bananas. 
[01:11:30]  How does it make you feel when you see it, though?  It used to make me vomit.  Now it's just like someone holding a spider to an arachnophobe or something.  Well, it looks like a spider because it's all like...  No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When it's open like that, it's like...  Why are you doing that?  Because it's an amazing reaction.  Leave him alone.  I've gotten better.  A year ago, I couldn't even be in this room.  In the room?  No.  You barely could be in the room.  You're, like, moving away from the mic.  When did you realize that there was this...  Ever since I was a child, I never liked it.  Wow. 
[01:12:00]  You know what the banana represents?  Who are we kidding?  Who are we kidding?  I can't have a squirt gun with milk shooting out of it.  Brrrr.  Brrrr.  Oh, but you're being very cruel.  It's his kryptonite.  He doesn't like that.  But it's amazing.  See, my problem is now, because bloody Robert Kelly, he tells everybody, and some guy  in, I don't know, Wisconsin or something, rings up and tells me that I don't like bananas.  I thought it was a fairly well-kept secret.  And now there's going to be, like, people at the show tonight just with a banana, just  sitting on their knee, just in the front of the room. 
[01:12:30]  Have them thrown out.  Oh, yeah.  Have them thrown out.  If you bring a banana, you will be thrown out of the venue.  I once shagged a bird.  Want to say that word?  Oh, sure.  Sure.  I once shagged a bird, and she put a condom on, and it was banana flat.  But I didn't know.  It was banana.  I vomited all over.  With that artificial smell of just...  You don't even like the smell of banana.  So you don't like any...  No, no, no.  A banana flavor.  Let's just see what happens.  Just hold this banana.  No, I'm not going to hold it.  I'm not going to hold it.  It just ain't going to happen.  Hold my banana. 
[01:13:00]  Something happened.  Did the scalp...  No, no.  I was, yeah.  I know, but I mean...  No, no.  Was I molested with a banana?  No, no.  By breakfast or something, with that smell.  It's a visceral reaction.  My mom said even as a baby, I wouldn't eat, like, mashed up.  Bananas.  Really?  I remember my brothers used to hold me down and mash banana into my head.  Oh, what bastards.  Yeah, but I didn't like it before then.  They would do that because you didn't like it.  Yeah, because they didn't like it.  It wasn't the cause of it.  You know, I found... 
[01:13:30]  They weren't mashing bananas into your head.  That's what they told your mom.  The self-service, right?  You didn't have to do that.  Hopi, why are you being such an ass to our guest?  I'm just showing love, man.  We love this Tim Jeffries guy.  How would you like if someone brought a vacuum in and just started vacuuming around you?  Don't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  He hates vacuums.  Anthony figured out a way to make you stop.  Why wouldn't you like vacuums? 
[01:14:00]  Bit over.  Bit over.  The sound of a vacuum drives him nuts.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  My mom would vacuum our house, I don't know, hours at a time.  And we'd be watching TV and...  And when they found that out...  Lift your feet!  Listeners would start calling.  Lift your feet.  Listeners would start calling and over the phone just play the vacuum sound and it would freak them out.  I'm like...  Exhaust fans in bathrooms?  Vacuums, it's the same sort of sound?  No, it's just vacuums. 
[01:14:30]  I'm lucky enough now in my life to have a cleaning lady and she comes once a week and she was vacuuming the other day.  I had to leave the apartment.  Really?  I had to leave the apartment.  Ah, alright, see?  Look what it does.  I love that sound.  It smells good.  That's my thing.  Yeah, I like that sound.  And just like you, I don't know why.  It can't be just because my mom was vacuuming a lot as a kid.  But look at my arm.  Goosebumps right away from the sound of a vacuum.  Can I feel them?  Yeah, here you go. 
[01:15:00]  Ooh.  You know what...  That was very sensual.  What the hell did he do?  You know what gets me?  You know the air hose on a compressor?  Use it like to clean off...  If you work in a shop, you use it to blow off sawdust or metal chips off a lathe or something like that.  To put it a little too close to your arm and hit the air and it makes your skin go like a little bit, that I can't even deal with that.  How often does that happen?  Well, you know something? 
[01:15:30]  When you're working a shop, it happens a lot.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, because you're like cleaning stuff up.  Did you used to do that?  And just the air coming out of the nozzle kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I'm sadistic, though.  I will do a bit where we get a lot of vacuums, turn them on all at the same time.  I want to see how many vacuums I can take before I actually have to leave the studio.  Because I will leave the studio eventually.  I don't think one.  The one makes the goosebumps pop up immediately and the hair on the back of my neck.  But, you know, and someone is reminding us we're missing the obvious here. 
[01:16:00]  What?  Maury.  Maury fears.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you would be perfect on Maury Povich.  Because he has people confront their fears, you know, to help them.  Whoa.  Whoa, the banana's getting loose in my hand.  Don't.  Whoa, it has a life of its own.  Whoa.  You know something?  Whoa.  Stop it, will you?  Stop it.  Whoa.  This isn't even good radio.  Stop it.  People at home are already bored of this.  This is boring.  Jim has been nothing but a great guest on our program.  And you're rewarding him by being a douche. 
[01:16:30]  I won't vomit or anything.  I'm all right.  My ex-flatmate put a banana in my underwear drawer.  And I punched him in the head.  You punched him?  And I made him wash all my underwear as well.  It's weird because you look down.  Like, you can't make eye contact with the banana or the person that is holding the banana.  You kind of look down and shy away from the microphone.  Watch.  Whoa.  Oh, would you?  Why?  It's that little flinch that a dog gets that you've hit a lot.  That's what I say.  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what you look like.  No, no, no, no.  Don't give it to Norton. 
[01:17:00]  I'm actually just going to give it to Norton.  Don't give it to Norton.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  You can't watch people eat a banana.  No, the whole density of the thing, and they chew it.  Jimmy, let's eat our banana.  And they chew it.  Oh, my God.  Why are you doing this to this man?  Jimmy, we won't.  My mouth is sticky.  Oh, my God.  They're so...  I'd rather eat big-eyed tongue.  Oh, my God.  Nothing you said that.  Hey.  Jim.  It's too thick.  No, see, look.  He's going to leave. 
[01:17:30]  Don't leave.  See, he's going to leave.  He's leaving.  It's just a...  I'll be back.  Just finish your banana.  It's delicious.  Holy crap.  This is a real thing.  He just left.  Dude, this is not fake.  He doesn't like bananas.  It's thick and banana-y.  Next time he comes to New York, we have to have a studio filled with bananas.  Quickly, Joe.  I was...  Hundreds of them.  I had a smoothie yesterday, and it's, you know, banana, heavy banana and strawberry,  but it smells like banana, and he was kind of sitting, like, in the seat next to me. 
[01:18:00]  I wonder if that was bothering him.  Oh, this sucks.  All right.  We like him too much.  Wait, let me finish my banana.  He's been a great guest.  You don't want to have him not come back.  I'm going to have a hissy fit.  I'll be back.  Just finish the bananas.  What?  I can't hear you.  Just finish the bananas.  Could you walk to that mic?  I can't hear you.  I'm not being a girl.  I just...  What?  Ovi's got the banana peel just cocked back in his hand like he's ready to heave it at  him. 
[01:18:30]  You are so mean.  He's giving us such great radio, too.  Jimmy, are you done with your banana?  I certainly am.  Okay.  No, Jimmy's put the banana peel on his head.  Look, we'll make it fun.  We'll wear them as little banana hats.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  Jim, look.  Look what I do for you.  No, don't.  No, I'm serious.  Don't dangle it, man.  What?  Even this?  I'll start swearing when we take it off the air.  You don't want this.  Leave him alone.  Do you like Jimmy's banana hat? 
[01:19:00]  I like Jimmy's banana hat.  Yeah.  Coochie.  That is weird.  It's not nice.  Jimmy, you got one of those things?  Mine is vacuums.  His is bananas.  His is air hoses.  Do you think I would tell you?  I have one and I would never tell you.  You got one?  Oh, yeah.  Isn't it an innocent thing?  Kind of.  Heterosexual sex?  Isn't it an innocent thing?  See, mine's...  Like the laugh of a small child?  Oh, I got something for you.  Thank you, Thad.  You're holding it open. 
[01:19:30]  I got the feeling, so appealing, for us to get together and sing.  Sing!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  It grows in bunches  I've got my hunches 
[01:20:00]  It's the best  Beats the rest  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring  Banana phone  You're a best, though  I'm doing the dancing banana  Yeah  Banana phone  Pick wine  It's no baloney  It ain't a phony  My cellular  Banana phone  All right  Jim  It's in the bin  Listen, listen  There we go  Dead and buried  It's in the garbage  Did you get Norton's one as well? 
[01:20:30]  I threw mine out  Oh, okay  All right, we're okay  I'm sorry about that  And now people think I'm an idiot  I have another one  But I do enjoy a good banana  I like to eat them  Yeah  I know people too  It's a superfood  It's a superfood  It's full of some vitamin  That I obviously lack  I have potassium  You've never had a banana?  No, no  That's so weird  All right, we've got Big A in studio  Someone offered me about $500 once  To eat a little bit  And I  Well, could you do that for our radio show  Next time you're in town?  That would be terrific radio  I would need much more money than that 
[01:21:00]  Would you ever take a gig  That was when I was poor  At Bananas in Poughkeepsie  That's a funny question  Would you ever take a gig at Bananas in Poughkeepsie?  I can handle the word  Yeah?  There's big bananas hanging  It's fake  Oh, yeah, they're fake  But they're big  You can do that?  I used to have one of those blow-up bananas  That you rode in the pool with  Oh, really?  Like a pool pony  But I was cool with that  Oh, okay  So you're not completely insane  It's just actual bananas  I can't go to Queensland, though  Up in Queensland  There's just banana plantations everywhere  Oh, wow  And I have my hands of walking through it 
[01:21:30]  And the trees attacking me  No, they're not trees  They're like bamboo-y type things  Yeah, banana, whatever they are  If you were drowning  Yes  And the only way to reach you  Was with a banana  Would you grab it?  What do you mean the only way to reach me?  Like you're just out of hands reach  Oh, yeah  So you're saying a banana  This is going to happen, is it?  That the only way to reach me is banana  You haven't got an item of clothing  That you can chuck off with your hand  You're naked  You're only holding a banana  You couldn't stick your leg out instead 
[01:22:00]  Which is longer than your arm  You're just out of legs reach  He had to put a banana between his toes  The banana  I love how this guy  Geoffrey's rules  I would tell you that  Use your leg or use your shirt  Yeah  Something like that  Or I just  Because then I know  Even if you save me  Then on the boat  Going back to the big boat  You'd just be baiting me with a banana  The whole time  It's true  And that would be uncomfortable 
[01:22:30]  And we'll go  Who saved ya?  Who saved ya?  Just had to jump in the water again  Hey, this is Jim Jefferies  Check out my stuff  On my MySpace page  I think it's just  Fucking  MySpace  Dash  Jim Jefferies  But put in my name  It'll come up  Or join me on Facebook  There's not as much information there  But people seem to enjoy it more  The virus  You're listening to the worst  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  We're very excited  Yes  Absolutely  Right off the bat  This is the way to start the XM portion of the show, Anthony 
[01:23:00]  Yeah  You want to introduce our guests as I try to get my headphones right?  The  And I am saying legendary  Yes  You are a legend  Look at him, he's all embarrassed  George A. Romero  Thank you  Sir  Hello  Huge fans  Right here  The legend is old, I think  You know, that's the front  No, no  You know something, though?  You've been a legend for a while  So  We're all huge fans  I mean, the  The films 
[01:23:30]  Are just fascinated  I know me  For years  They're amongst some of the most frightening movies  And it's not even  That slasher  Frightening  Or the trendy  Whatever  The super du jour  Kind of scary  Is  This  Your movies are that  It's that consistent  Just frightening  Zombie movie  That people are actually  You know, they get scared  They can't sleep afterwards  Yeah 
[01:24:00]  And just  The whole series  Has just been fantastic  And now you have something new coming out  Diary of the Dead  Yeah, Diary of the Dead  Yep  It's coming out February 15th  And what's the gist?  Small, limited release  It's a much smaller picture  It's about  My zombie films have always been about  Sort of what's happening out in the world  You know, it's not so much the story  It's the zombies  You know, they could be a hurricane  Or any other disaster  And the stories are more about  How people respond  Or fail to respond 
[01:24:30]  To the dilemma  Yeah  And this is about  It's really about this  Emerging  You know, alternate media  How the whole world is being  Everybody's being turned into a reporter  It strikes me as a little scary  So that's what this is about  And it goes back to the very first night  It goes back to the night of  Night of the Living Dead  And it's sort of a parallel story  A bunch of film students out  Shooting a school project  When the zombies begin to walk  So they document  It's all subjective camera  And they document what happens to them 
[01:25:00]  Over the first three days  And that's it  In a nutshell  Like Cloverfield just came out  They had that same thing  Same kind of conceit  Yeah  Language  Yeah  Which probably didn't make you happy  That  Like, wait a minute  I've been working on this  Yeah, well I was working  Before I knew anything  Doing this with zombies  You're best  Yeah  But that's a big  You know, that's a big budget  You know, what  New York gets destroyed  Or something  Yeah  This is very different  It's a very personal film 
[01:25:30]  It was really for me  Going back to the roots  And, you know  We shot on a very low budget  And I had for the first time  Since  Night of the Living Dead  Had complete control of it  So I'm the guy to blame  And, you know  It's really sort of  One from the heart  What's your favorite work  That you've done?  I mean, you obviously  Have a very complete body of work  What's your favorite thing  That you've shot?  Is it Night of the Living Dead?  Is it Dawn of the Dead?  No, no, it's not  It's neither  My favorite two films  Are a film I made called Martin  And a film I made called Night Riders  I think nine people saw them 
[01:26:00]  In the average  You know, luckily  Thank God for video  You know, stuff goes out  Yeah  So I have 65-year-old fans  And 16-year-old fans  Thanks to video  Yeah, absolutely  What, uh  The fascination  With zombies  I mean, it's  There aren't many  Unless they're really  I mean, garbage  But there aren't many  Zombie movies  That aren't  Aren't a hit with people  And your movies especially  Yeah, it's hard to name  The really big ones 
[01:26:30]  I mean, Shaun of the Dead  Was great  It's kind of a spoof  Yeah, definitely  The original remake  Of my film  The remake of  Dawn of the Dead  Made a lot of dough  Some of the other  I don't think of the  28 days or 28 weeks  Films as zombie films  No  Because they're not dead  They're infected  Infected  And they run  And they run  They run  Which does not pay attention  To the George A. Romero  Rule of zombies  Yeah, you don't run  Which is the lumbering  Slow zombie  That somehow  Sneaks up on you  Well, you know  Maybe it's the influence 
[01:27:00]  Of when I was growing up  You know, the old  Christopher Lee mummy things  You could blow him  Full of holes  And he just keeps coming  Moves slow  But he just keeps coming  And that's the thing  That I find that scarier  Than something running  After me, you know  Because there's that  Anticipation  You know, right  Instead of something  Running right at you  And attacking you  And it's the surprise  Of, you know  Opening that door  Or if you're fumbling  To try to find some keys  In the car  And you get up and turn  And hello  He's right there 
[01:27:30]  He's right there  That's a little scarier  Than somebody just running  After you  I know, it's great  Well, it's like the original  Version of the thing  The Christian Nyby version  You know, it's all about doors  When you open a door  Then a couple of times  There he is  Yeah  And it just  You know, to me  That's the  It is anticipation  It's build up  Rather than the actual  That slow hopelessness  That's just going to get you  Eventually  Yeah  Well, that was  Hanging there  It's going to outlast you  That was the scariest part  Of Halloween for me  Was Michael Myers  He didn't run  He just walked  And yet he always got there 
[01:28:00]  Before you did  It was creepy  This guy knows a lot of shortcuts  But he didn't run  And that was the beauty of him  The victim is just not smart  I mean, come on  You should be able  To outrun a zombie  Let's be honest here  Oh, yeah  In my films  That's people  That's the mistake  That everybody makes  They keep trying to go on  With life as if it's normal  You know  Yeah  Just get out of town  It's not  No  Something dead  Is alive out there  The original  Night of the Living Dead  Especially for the time  Was very shocking  The eating of the entrails 
[01:28:30]  And stuff like that  Did you come across  Any resistance  With the ratings  I don't  No, no  It probably wasn't even  A ratings board  No, that's  Listen  That film is old enough  That there was no MPAA  Yeah, yeah  In fact  It was one of the films  That people used to point at  And say that  We really need somebody  To control these guys  Thanks  Thanks for our contribution  So you ruined it  Because you're like  You can see  Kentucky Fried Movie 
[01:29:00]  Well, it was that  And there were a couple  Of concert films  I guess the prior concerts  Were after the MPAA  But, you know  There were a few films  That were out  But then  The second  Dawn of the Dead  And Day of the Dead  We were lucky enough  To get distributors  That put them out  Without ratings  You know  They bucked the MPAA  And put them out  Without a rating  And there was a time  When you could do that  Because like  The prior concerts  Were going out unrated  And you know  It still had a little bit  Of respect  It wasn't  You know  It's funny man  You can get away  With violence 
[01:29:30]  As much as you want  But you start  You know  You go sex  And forget about it  You get slammed  Then they want  The X rating on it  Yeah  Well whereas  You know  In the UK  Get away with  As much sex  As you want  But violence  Then they don't  Like the violence  Over there  Have you thought  About a zombie porn  I haven't  No  But maybe  If I could think  Of a good theme  For that  You know  There have been  Some scenes  In some of the movies  With you know  You see some  Half naked zombie girl 
[01:30:00]  And for some reason  It's surprisingly hot  I don't know why  I don't know why  A zombie breast  I'll tell you why  It takes the charm away  When you see the toe tags  Yeah  So  No it actually  It actually adds charm  Because it's everything  You want a girl to be  It's like you know  She's naked  And she doesn't say a word  It just moans a lot  Too much man  Hey is there any movie  That scares the hell  Out of you  Like was it one  That you saw  Not for a long time  As a kid yeah 
[01:30:30]  The thing  I was talking about that  That scared me  Pretty much  When I was a kid  How about the original  Exorcist  The original Exorcist  You know  I was raised Catholic  So it added maybe  A little bit more  Of an effect on me  I've heard that  People that had  A Catholic upbringing  You know  Were more shook up  By that movie  Than others  But  Yeah  But I was old enough  Then and already  Had made my first  Couple of films  So you know  Knew the magic behind it  Yeah you know  That it's just  You're just looking  To see how did  They do that  Yeah  What was it like 
[01:31:00]  Coming up with  Some of the effects  Especially on the first one  Because that was  Pretty groundbreaking  Yeah well  I mean one of the investors  There were 26 investors  You know  Everybody  The biggest guy  Was in for 5G  Oh wow  So  Wow  One of them  Was a meat packer  So all those  Intestines  And livers  And everything  Actually came  From a meat packing plant  They were real  Fresh  He kept them  Refrigerated  Wow  It's an amazing  Stat here 
[01:31:30]  I'm sorry to interrupt you  Dawn of the Dead  Which would go on  To bring in  Over 55 million dollars  Was made for  500,000  Yeah  So it's like  When you hear  The investor  Was it for 5,000 bucks  That's a good investment  Yeah  Everybody picked up  A few shekels  On that one  But that was  The biggest one  That went out  Because it was  Very successful  It opened in Europe first  It was actually  Partially financed  By an Italian director  Dario Argento  I don't know  If any of you guys  Know his stuff  Suspiria  Oh Suspiria  Yeah that was creepy  I remember the commercial 
[01:32:00]  For that  Suspiria with the girl  Brushing her hair  Yeah  And she'd turn around  And have a skeleton face  Yeah  Scared the crap out of me  As a kid  How do you remember that?  I was sat in front of  I sat in front of the TV  A lot when I was a kid  You're supposed to remember that  Very good looking  What Anthony remembers  Just  Amazing  We got Danny in the studio  Danny has been  Freaked out  Ever since he  He knew you were coming in  Well I'm a big  That's right  You always wear the shirt  I'm a huge  Yeah I'm a huge Romero  Oh you're kidding me  He's the biggest  Absolutely 
[01:32:30]  Well thank you  You got a few questions?  Yeah I did  I did prepare  I'm prepared  If you understood  How amazing this is  What a sign of respect  This is for anybody  On this staff  To prepare for anything  Oh man  To prepare  Yeah right  I did write some  Typical fanboy questions  Oh boy  Oh alright  Let's go with it  You're just trying  To get on message voice  I'm sure you've answered  A million times  But I will try anyway  You did mention  The Italian release  Of Dawn of the Dead  Yeah  And I do know that  I believe the pronunciation 
[01:33:00]  Of his name is  Lucio Fulci  If I'm not mistaken  Yeah  He came out with  Zombie 2  Which was kind of like  But the pronunciation  Of pronunciation  Is pronunciation  You're told  That's the Italian pronunciation  Of pronunciation  Pronunciation  Now rephrase that  And ask Mr. Remero  Oh daddy wanted  To sound smart there  No  Come on  I knew the beauty of that  Alright  But I was curious 
[01:33:30]  If you really felt  That Zombie 2  Was a rip off  Of your work  Well I think it was  Not only  Well let's say  Inspired by it  But they ripped off  The title  Because Dawn of the Dead  The title in Italy  Was Zombie  Was Zombie  Right  So this guy comes out  And says  I'm going to make  Zombie 2  With nobody's permission  You know  Or anything else  But I like some  Of Fulci's films  I mean he probably  Has made more of  The sort of  Zombie knockoffs  Than anybody else  In the world  And some of them  Were really pretty funny  And okay 
[01:34:00]  I mean old  And you know  They wouldn't stand up  Today I don't think  But they're not  Political at all  They're just  No they're just  Kind of good creepy movies  Yeah  Speaking of messages  In your films  I know  You know  A lot of people say  That Dawn of the Dead  Dealt with consumerism  And Night of the Living Dead  Dealt a lot with  The racial tension  At the time  But Day of the Dead  The third installment  A lot of people say  That that focused  Really around the AIDS virus  And the fear of AIDS  At the time  Now I don't know  If that's true  No it's not  It wasn't even  What was in my mind  To me it was all  About mistrust  I mean it seems like  That was right around 
[01:34:30]  The time when we were  Starting to lose faith  In everything  You know  The military  The government  Institutions  Church  And individuals  I mean losing faith  In each other  So to me  That's what  That's what I was  Working with  With that film  It's just this  Breakdown  Of society  Because nobody  Trusts anybody  You know  Even in that  Little community  Living in a cave  That's what's so  Sorry Danny  That's what's so  Intriguing about the movies  Is that slow  Kind of breakdown  Of society  And I don't know 
[01:35:00]  Why that's so  Fascinating to people  But it really is  In movies  When there's this  Just complete  Breakdown of society  And only a few  Actually can  Make it through that  Yeah  I don't know  There used to be  A genre  You know  Before I started  You know  Like the world  Of flesh and the devil  There's nobody  Left in New York  Except Harry Belafani  I guess  I haven't seen  The Will Smith thing  But maybe it's  A little bit like that  Yeah  It's interesting 
[01:35:30]  Because I basically  Ripped off the idea  For Night of the Living Dead  From the book  I Am Legend  Really?  Yeah  Before the other versions  Of that film  Were made  Yeah that was kind of  An Omega Man remake  Matheson in the book  And I guess  In this film  Starts with only one  Guy left in the world  And everyone  Has become a vampire  And you know  So I felt  Well you know  It's the 60s  And I said  Well this is like  About revolution  But you know  Start the story  At the beginning  Rather than 
[01:36:00]  When there's only  One guy left  And so that's  What I wanted to do  So I knocked off  The idea  I told Richard  He said alright  If you make a lot  Of money  Send me a check  But that was a genre  That was a specific genre  And then I think  Maybe what we started  In the 60s and 70s  Those of us  That were working  Then there's a documentary  Called American Nightmare  About me  Wes Craven  Landis  Some of the guys  That were making  Like really hard 
[01:36:30]  Hard ass horror  Right around that time  And I think  We sort of wanted  To show the  You know  The roots of it  Maybe it was  You know  Our own sort of  You know  60s guys  Sitting around  Pissed off  Because our revolution  Hadn't worked  Right  Peace and love  Really didn't change  All of a sudden  There's this war  And some funny place  Over there  Viet  What  And rioting in the streets  Again and all that  But the racial thing  In that  I mean  You know  We  There's a  We used  African American actor  In the lead 
[01:37:00]  In Neither  He was just  The best actor  From Among Our Friends  We finished the film  And we were literally  Driving an answer print  To New York  In the car  And that night  In the car  On the radio  We heard that  Martin Luther King  Had been shot  And then  Which just completely  Changed the face  Of the movie  And you know  It was something  That we had done  Before that had happened  And you know  I don't know  I guess if there's  Any credit can be given  To us  Is that we didn't  Change the script  Yeah  When Dwayne 
[01:37:30]  Agreed to play the part  But that was  An accidental thing  But then all of a sudden  I felt this responsibility  I said  Oh man  I got a new job here  I have to do these  With a little bit  Of social  Satire  Kind of forced  Into the situation  Anyway  Sorry  Oh Danny  Could just stand there  Because I actually  Wanted to bring up  Vincent Price  And The Last Man on Earth  That's  I Am Legend  That's the same  That's the same  Story  Based on the same story  And that was another one  That just scared  The shit out of me  When  Let me in 
[01:38:00]  Yeah  And he's just  You know  There's nothing  It's that doom  When even in a movie  You realize  My God  There is no way  They're getting out of this  This isn't going to be  A happy ending  This you know  They're not going to  Wrap this up  By finding some way  To save the world  It's over Johnny  You know  Yeah  So that  That was also something  That we wanted to do  Seems to me  The reason to do horror  Is to upset the apple cart  Some  And in the old days  They used to just  Very deliberately  Re-establish order  Right 
[01:38:30]  Yeah  Kill a giant spider  And it's over  Right  And forget the bomb  That caused it  You know  Them was another one  With the ants  Yeah  But yeah  It's just that doom  Of oh my God  This movie's going to end  And they're just gone  Everybody's dead  It's fascinating stuff  I love it  Love that  Danny  Another question  Sure  Well I'm curious  If you feel any kind  Of responsibility  For a lot of the  Gaming industry today 
[01:39:00]  A lot of video games  Have to deal with  You know  A lot of  The more popular  Video games  Have to deal with  Zombies like  Resident Evil  And there's one  Called Stubbs the Zombie  And also  Anomalous  Silent Hill  The Silent Hill series  A little bit  And I think a lot of it  Really establishes a base  On a lot of your films  And I was wondering  If you felt the same way  Well I think that  Maybe that  My series of films  Particularly Dawn of the Dead  Caused a lot of that  But I think the thing  That is most responsible  For the zombie 
[01:39:30]  Becoming sort of a popular  You know  It's entered the lexicon  It's idiomatic  The rules are becoming  Idiomatic you know  Pretty soon there'll be  A zombie on Sesame Street  Hanging out with the cow  And I think it's video games  More than movies  That have made  That have popular  Really popularized  The new American zombie  Yeah  It has made transformation  Some of the zombies  There's one in particular  Dead Rising  I mean it's basically  Dawn of the Dead  The video game  You're a guy in a mall 
[01:40:00]  Yeah  You know  And there's zombies everywhere  So yeah  I mean that's just  They seem to have gotten  That idea from somebody  Yeah  That mall atmosphere  Though is classic  It's just so great  Because that is  The definition of  Who we are  And what we do  And then to have that  Is your last castle  You know  Your last bastion of hope  Is really great  In those movies  And just surrounded  By thousands of these  Creatures  Yeah  And then it's other humans  That win it 
[01:40:30]  You know  That win the day  When the bikers show up  But  I'm sorry  No no no  Please  I'm such a dope  I honestly  Never see social messages  Until like they're  Expanded  I'm like oh yeah  Honest to god  I would go  Wow that's kind of cool  A mall  I'm sitting here  Thinking the same thing  I'm like I must be  An idiot  Because I never  I look at it  And like oh these  Zombies are eating people  That's all I think  And they needed to do it  Somewhere why not a mall  That's true  I thought it was all  Product placement  He's trying to do  A little more 
[01:41:00]  Zombie is gargling  With Lavoris  I mean you said earlier  That the racial thing  Was accidental right  So you didn't do that  With that  You weren't shooting that  To make a statement  The first film no  You got lucky  When Martin Luther King  Caught a bullet  Yeah as we were  Starting to shoot it  Though we became  Aware of it  And Dwayne the actor  Was much more sensitive  To it than I was  You know I mean  He actually pulled me aside  And he said  You want me to slug  This white woman  You know what's  Going to happen  When I walk out  Of the theater  Oh jeez  He was sensitive  To all those issues 
[01:41:30]  When we were shooting it  Did you um  Oh sorry God  Yeah no no  I don't want to  Interrupt you  I'm sorry  No no  So you know  But then when  When it was time  When I finally  Decided to do  The second film  It was because  I met the people  I knew the people  Socially that  Developed that  Shopping mall  And I went out  To visit the place  And just before  It was open  The trucks were  Coming in  Bringing all this  Stuff man  You know  And I said  Wow  Perfect timing  Perfect timing  And he said  You know  There's  Civil defense 
[01:42:00]  Supplies upstairs  Bomb shelters  Everything  He said  You could survive  In this place  And I'm  Bing  You know  Like  Yeah  So I  And this was  Ten years  After the first film  And so  That gave me  The idea for it  And the idea  Of this  You know  Temple  To consumerism  And becoming  A place to survive  I thought it was  Sort of a fitting  Kind of a  Of a sequel  You know  There were just  Five of them  In a farmhouse  In the first film  The first movie  Scared me  I never sat  Through it  I couldn't sit  Through it 
[01:42:30]  It was too  Frightening  How do they  Kill the zombies  In the movie  Do they kill  The zombies  In the first film  Yeah  In any of them  No they  They get killed  They get killed  By humans  Yeah  They managed to  Beat him  Or burn him  I'm gonna watch  The movie  Beat him  Or burn him  Beat him  Or burn him  Right  They're all messed up  He's actually  Asking George  How a film  From 1968  Ends  Yeah  You know  I'll tell you  But look  I meant it as a compliment  I couldn't sit  Through that movie  I was too frightened  That's another compliment  I can't sit  Through your movies  You're a social zombie 
[01:43:00]  I've had reviewers  Say that  I couldn't sit  But let me tell you  What I thought about  Danny anything else  Well sure  Well since we're  On the topic of  Night anyway  I was wondering  What you thought  Of Tom Savini's  Color remake  I mean the ending  Was a little  Twisted  You weren't expecting that  But I was wondering  If you felt that  It lived up to your standards  What was the difference  In the ending Danny  I don't remember  In the remake  Cooper is the one  That gets killed  At the end  Just because he was  A giant asshole  Okay 
[01:43:30]  Well he does  Tony Todd  Gets killed as well  It's just that  Barbara survives  That was the  I was apologizing  To women  When I wrote that script  Barbara  Because in the first film  She just loses her shoes  Falls down  Typical  You know  Like 50's  Always a maiden girl  They're coming for you  Barbara  So that was really  It was an apology  To women  But I liked it 
[01:44:00]  I thought Tom  Did a great job  We were basically  Trying to reestablish  A copyright  You know  We lost the copyright  On the first film  Tom's pretty  At the forefront  Of special effects  And that type of makeup  Yeah  Well he was  He was really  He was the go to guy  For a long time  Yeah  Absolutely  But he now  Is more interested  In acting  Yeah  Well that's what  I wanted to ask you too  Because he was in  A movie that I just  I think is great  And obviously  Your opinion matters  In certain movies  A dust till dawn 
[01:44:30]  Yeah  A dust till dawn  That one  He was in that  Sex machine  Yeah  Sex machine  I thought that was  A pretty cool movie  Yeah  I liked it a lot  He's in Grindhouse too  Yeah  Grindhouse  Did you like Grindhouse?  I like Grindhouse  Yeah  Planetary  Huh?  Not Planetary  You enjoyed  What they did  With the  Planetary  I did  I liked the  I liked the other one  Better  You know  I mean  I love  I mean  I know those guys  And you know  I just had a good time  Watching it  Right  I don't know that  Audiences today 
[01:45:00]  Get that  You know  That there could be  A real missing  And it's all scratched up  And burns on it  I mean that doesn't  Happen anymore  Right  Better not  Yeah  I mean the whole thing  Fell flat  But I really enjoyed it  I would say that  You know  Now that we're not  Promoting the film anymore  I enjoyed the experience  Of Grindhouse  Yeah  Me too  All the way  Do you as a  As a director  And as an artist  Do you like  Because this one film  Is basically  Or a couple of films  Is like people  Associate you with that  Like does it bother you  That other stuff you did 
[01:45:30]  Isn't as well associated  Or are you happy  Just to have something  That massive  That you're kind of  Pegged with it  You know  Of course  It always bothers you  When people don't get  What you're doing  You know  I made a film called  Bruiser  Nobody got it  I mean you know  It's just  Somehow just went  You know  It's in a different  Layer of the atmosphere  Or something  What was Bruiser about  It's called Bruiser  What was it about  It's about loss of identity  It's about a guy  That just gets so  You know  Screwed  By people  Everybody around him 
[01:46:00]  His wife  His boss  His friends  And he just  Believes that he  Completely  He believes he loses  His face  It's you know  It's loss of identity  And he turns violent  Because of it  Wow  The film was a bit  Of a reaction  To Columbine  And you know  And I like the film a lot  But nobody got it  I think they thought  It was too  Maybe too silly  This guy running around  Without a face  You know  I thought it would be scary  But people didn't  Seem to  Is there anything worse  That's a risky  I like how you go  Like  What are you going to do 
[01:46:30]  I still like it  I couldn't sit through  Vinny  Let me tell you  How it ends  That's got to be  Very frustrating too  Like when you do  A comedy  And no one laughs  You know  That's got to be  When you do  A horror film  Vinny  I was thinking  Jimmy  But I was like  I'm not going to do that  No  I'm going to get you  When you do  A horror film  And people go  Ah it didn't scare me  That's got to be like  Fuck  Yeah right  That's your purpose  It is  I mean it's  You know  Although I don't know  I haven't been  My stuff is more 
[01:47:00]  Comic book-y  It's got  It's got this  Creepy thing  Of you know  All these dead  The neighbors  Dead neighbors  Walking around  Yeah  Yeah  And you know  Neighbors are scary enough  When they're dead  It's a little  That was the  The whole gist  Of the one with  Ving Rhames  And the beginning  Of that one  Where it's just  The neighbors  And  That's the best part  Of that  The girl  Yeah I love that part  Where she wakes up  You know  Her boyfriend  Or husband  Is it  Just gets killed 
[01:47:30]  By the kid  Next door  And she walks out  Not knowing what's going on  And it's already  You know  She's been sleeping  That's what got me  Is she was sleeping  At some point  When utter pandemonium  Is going on  Right outside her door  Yeah  And she opens her door  To this  And again  It's just over  There's nothing she can do  About it  But try to run  But that's a great part  Of that movie  I thought that was  The best part of the film  The overhead shots  Of the car  And the carnage  Going on around  It was fantastic  And of course 
[01:48:00]  Creepshow  Speaking of comic bookie  Yeah  Oh yeah  It was the most fun  To shoot  That  The tagline  Was the most fun  You'll ever have  Being scared  But it was the most  Fun to shoot  I watch that  Still  Every few months  Just to  Get a great laugh  I mean  Some of the scenes  In that  Are hysterical  One of my favorite  Is  Ted Danson  Buried up to his neck  In the sand  With the crab  And Leslie Nielsen  Just goes  Found a friend Harry 
[01:48:30]  As a matter of factly  Great  So many funny scenes  In that  Where's my cake  Bedelia  You bitch  Boy I can't believe  You know all these lines  Oh it's  I've watched it  So many times  Bugs Mr. Pratt  Oh yeah  Bugs got your tongue  I mean just  Funny lines  That you just  Keep laughing  It doesn't matter  I've seen it  A thousand times  And I'll still laugh  And of course  Probably the top one  Out of that  Is along with  Adrian Barbeau 
[01:49:00]  Right  And I'm sorry  Tell it to call you Billy  Yeah  Yeah  Just tell it to call you Billy  And that surprise shot  Where he just  She's bitching at him  He pulls a huge gun out  And just shoots her in the head  And everyone goes  Great shot  And you're looking like  What the hell just happened  And realize he's just  Fantasizing about  The whole thing  Fantastic man  I love that movie  That was really fun to do  It was great fun to do  Hey let's go to the phones  A lot of people want to get in  On the interview with George Romero  It's Kent  The movie guy 
[01:49:30]  Kent  Hey Kent  Hold on  We gotta get some headphones on  Okay  I got it  Sorry about that  You're on the air  Kent go ahead  Not hearing it  I went and saw  Land of the Dead  In Japan  With my dad  Totally coincidentally  And my dad  Never seen a horror movie  In his entire life  And he got so scared  He didn't know how to deal  With it at the end  So he just slugged me  We're walking out  Of this movie theater 
[01:50:00]  And the biggest compliment  You can get in Japan  I hear is just  Complete silence  Like that's how they  Respect the movie over there  And they were all walking out  And they were all talking about it  And everything  So they weren't being silent  All the girls are scared  And then all of a sudden  My dad  This 6 foot 4 white guy  Slugs me  And we're just getting stared at  By maybe 50 to 70 Japanese people  Wow  Can I tell you what a great point  George just made  The guy goes  The biggest compliment  You can give in movies  Is to not talk about it  And then he goes  And so everybody in Japan 
[01:50:30]  Is walking and chit-chatting about it  Talking  It's like gee thanks  I mean  You know like here  If a movie's really good  They'll give applause  At the end of the movie  There it's just like  Everyone gets up  Oh I see  Hey George  I mean how bad was it  How bad did he hit  How tough was it  I didn't want to miss the moment  Are you casting for new zombies  Not right now  We got the perfect guy  He just walked in with our food  You gotta meet  Club Soda Kenny  Could be the star  He's got no personality 
[01:51:00]  He's got hair like a zombie  It's all dry  Here  He just smiled  He just smiled  That doesn't  No smiling  Watch this  I apologize  Sorry to mean to  And he's dumb as a zombie  Yes  That's correct  We can have him  Brighten up a little bit  And chipper up  To play the zombies  If you need him to  A little more lively  Maybe  Where do the majority  Of the zombies  Come from  In the movies  The cast  Are they just 
[01:51:30]  Extras  Extras  And friends  You ever get friends  To go  Hey I want to be a zombie  Yes  And we've been able  To do that  The last two films  We shot in Canada  And the unions  Are really rigid up there  Zombie union  Yeah zombie unions  The dead have rights  So you can only use friends  On days when you have hired  A certain amount of union  Extras  So you know  It's a little tougher 
[01:52:00]  To do that  When I was working  In Pittsburgh  I made all my films  Except for the  Until the last three  In Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  And they were outside  The  You know  The circle  Of I think  There's a 300 mile limit  On the New York  Extras union  Oh really  So you know  We were able to do  Whatever we wanted to do  But  Over  Up in Canada  It's pretty  It's pretty rigid  And you've had to  But they come from  I mean you know  And I'm telling you man  Sometimes professionals  Are worse  I mean it's much rather  Have buddies 
[01:52:30]  Or you know  Yeah  Literally the neighbors  I would guess people  That are familiar  With your work  Probably  Know how to imitate  What you want better  Than  Somebody you're trying  To actually direct  You know  I think we've all  Kind of done  That whole thing  There was a funny scene  In Shaun of the Dead  That spoofy kind of scene  Where they had to mix in  With the zombies  So they all  Trying to act like zombies  Yeah exactly  And yeah  That's kind of  Kind of funny  When you think of 
[01:53:00]  Getting an actor  In there  And having to tell him  Alright do this  Or no you're not  Getting it right  You're not zombie enough  I can't make a physical move  I mean if I'm talking  To a bunch of extras  If I even just do this  You know then  All of a sudden  You get everybody  Doing it  It looks like Thriller  Choreograph  But so people  I find that it's best  To leave people up  To you know  Let them do what  Their interpretation  Yeah  Sometimes you get  Great stuff  I mean sometimes  You get these  Really exaggerated  You know things  You have to cut around 
[01:53:30]  Or cut out  Yeah  But you very often  Get some really  Creative stuff  Some of the creepiest  Ones are that  Emotionless dropped face  Where it's just  You know it's just  Some mindless thing  Coming after you  Yeah  And those are the  Creepiest ones  Drooling maybe  I want a zombie  That snaps his fingers  That's what you need  One zombie  That just snaps a little  Fingers would break  Yeah  Just snap off  Snap  Let's say hi to  Colin in Florida  Colin  Hi Mr. Romero 
[01:54:00]  Hi Colin  It's an honor  To speak to you  Thank you  The staff already  Brought up  The Resident Evil  Movie  Yeah  And you actually  Wrote a script for it  Yeah  Could you talk about that  Well I got fired  It's the first time  I ever got fired  Jeez  We were working with  It was a German company  We were working with  Executives in LA  And with Capcom  With the game company  And we thought  We had you know  Really written  A pretty good script  But the management 
[01:54:30]  Of the production company  Just didn't want  To go that way  So you know  I mean I didn't  Really get fired  I got paid  For the work  And everything  But they decided  That they wanted  To just go  A different direction  Which had nothing  To do with the game  It's got to be hard  To do  Your script is online  And is far superior  To the dreck  That they put on there  And just the epitome  Of Hollywood  Not knowing  What people want  Yeah  Well in this case  It wasn't Hollywood  The Hollywood office  Of Constantine  Really liked it 
[01:55:00]  It was the German  Headquarters  That didn't like it  Thank you sir  That's amazing  Thank you  It's weird  It's got to be hard  Writing a script  Like that too  Because so much  Of the horror  Or the vibe of it  Is in the way  It's shot  And is in the  Like you said  The face  The drop  To all these  Different things  It's kind of hard  To put in a script  So people will  Just look at the script  And go well  What is this going to do  Yeah it doesn't scare me  Right  There's no music  I'm going to send  Some musicians over  With the script  Man opens the door  Lady's standing there 
[01:55:30]  Fix this  It's not scary  And then when you  Look at it  Of course  Let's go to  Jody in New York  Jody  Hi  Hi  I was wondering  Why zombies  Can't walk upstairs  They can  Sure they can  I don't think  They walk upstairs  Well they have  In my films  Yeah  The end of dawn  They climb a ladder  I mean they get up  To the roof  Actually in dawn  Thank god you called  Yeah  Because she would have  Run upstairs  If there were zombies  And they'd have gotten her  She'd have been surprised 
[01:56:00]  A better question is  Why don't they take elevators  Well they have a hard time  With escalators  They also do take an elevator  Yeah  They take elevators  And they also just miss  Getting into elevators  Which is very good  One zombie pushes the button  And the other zombie's like  I already pushed that  Why did you have to re-push it  Even as zombies  They're annoyed  Let's see how people do that  In Georgia  Sean  Hey Mr. Romero  Hi  Have you read any of the  Zombie literature  Like World War Z 
[01:56:30]  And anything like that  And what do you think  About those  You know it's  I don't know  What can I say  I mean I like Max  He's a great guy  Max Brooks  And I like the survival guy  And I like World War Z  But you know  I don't know  It's not my stuff  You know  My stuff is  I have this peculiar niche  And my stuff is all  Really about what's happening  In the world  And you know  It's not sort of zombies  For the sake of zombies 
[01:57:00]  And so  Max takes it very seriously  As if it were a real plague  And that's the way  He approaches it  And you know  Great  That's  Can I paraphrase?  George thinks it's shit  Yeah  He's just being a little too nice  For the show  He's a nice guy  No I didn't  He's a crap ball  George  Do you watch the newer horror films  And what do you think of them?  Like Hostel  Or Saw  I've seen enough of them  To sort of  Stay away from the sequel  But  It's just not  Again  Not your thing? 
[01:57:30]  Not my thing  I'm much more of a traditionalist  I mean I'm much more of  I'd rather do Creepshow  I'd rather do something  A little more  Operatic or Gothic  And you know  It's just what  It's all about  What you grew up on  Sure  Did that guy really have roaches  On his face?  Yeah  Yeah he did  We had to  I mean the only way  To get him  To stay there  We had  They had to give him  CO2 or something  You know  To slow him down  Because otherwise  We would  They would dump out  A big Rubbermaid  Trash can  Full of roaches  On that set 
[01:58:00]  And within 20 seconds  You couldn't see one  I mean  Wow  They just disappear  Take the phone apart  And there's this  Phone shaped thing  Which is like  The old roach  And it was dreadful  It's the worst time  That me and my crew  Ever had on a set  It was just hideous  Because they were  Everywhere  They'd get in your briefcase  They'd get  You know  You were pulling them out  With your script  That's awful  It was dreadful  Where'd they get them from?  They had to go to Trinidad  Chinese restaurant  Trinidad 
[01:58:30]  Trinidad  Left an egg roll  On the table  At the stretch factory  Oh  Oh  Vinnie gets it  Unnecessary  I say  Why didn't you go to Trinidad  For cockroaches?  They  If you  If you buy cockroaches  From a lab  We needed like  You know  500,000 roaches  So  They charge 50 cents a piece  Really?  That's a little  Plusheed into the budget  Yeah  Cheaper to send guys  To Trinidad  And they literally  Brought back  Barrels of these things  And they had their own trailer 
[01:59:00]  It had to be climatized  It was  So wait  They would just ship  A barrel of live roaches  Yeah  What do they put food wise  In there for them?  How do they eat?  You know  I don't know that  I don't know  These guys  A piece of cheese  Anything  You can throw anything  You can eat anything  I have to shit  Well there's the barrel  They eat each other  You know  I don't know  I don't know  What they did that way  I don't know  There's a creep show  Entry on the IMDB  Listed for release this year  Now  I mean  I was wondering  Is that a remake  Or a sequel  And do you have anything  To do with that at all?  No it's a remake  And I had nothing  To do with it  Neither did Steve 
[01:59:30]  Oh Stephen King  Stephen King  Do you have any plans  With Stephen King  For any upcoming  You know  We're always talking  About a project  I mean  We've been on again  Off again  On several things  Tom Gordon  Buick 8  And you know  Somehow  The stuff just never  You know  Neither  Never happens  You know  It's pretty hard  To figure why  But no  We're not working  On anything right now  But Steve's  You know  We're still in touch  Steve does a newscaster voice  In my new film  Oh really?  Yeah  A bunch of guys  Came out to do that 
[02:00:00]  Quentin  Tarantino  Wes Craven  Oh yeah  Anybody involved in horror  Quentin's got to be  A huge fan  I'm sure  Yeah  It was fun  It was fun  You know  It was just great  That they came out  To do it  You know  It was terrific  You know  What else I like  About your work  Is that  Putting humor  In these horrible situations  There's a great  Gruesome scene  Where they're all  On top of the mall  Shooting into the crowd  And they're holding up  The names of celebrities 
[02:00:30]  That the zombies look like  Which was just  I was in the movie theater  With my girlfriend  And we were laughing  Hysterical  And no one else  Was laughing  I was really laughing hard  Jay Leno  Is one of them  I guess  Jay Leno  Hey look  And it's a zombie  That looks like Jay Leno  And the guy just  Blows his head off  And it's  It's a gruesome scene  But hysterically funny  Yeah  And I've noticed  That's been a trend  In your work  Yeah  Well that was actually  In Zach's film  That was in the remake 
[02:01:00]  Yeah yeah  But I can't resist  I mean I had a pie fight  In Dawn of the Dead  Man  I just couldn't resist it  You know  I just  You know  You're out  You find yourself  Out in the middle  Of nowhere  Shooting one of these things  And you know  Half of your friends  Are going to have goop  All over their face  And you can't help  But chuckle  You know  And so  I can't resist jokes  There's a few of them  In the new film too  There's one that I thought  Was just going to be  Way way too 
[02:01:30]  Too slapstick  But  I won't tell people  What it is  But it's turned out  To be one of the  Favorite scenes in it  So I guess  There's place  There's room for humor  I want to  You want to go to  Just because you  Mentioned that Jimmy  Brett from Long Island  He's actually seen  Diary of the Dead  At Tribeca  Don't give any  Of the movie away  Brett  But what do you have to say  I saw it  Two weeks ago  And I thought  It was one of the most  Refreshing pieces of work  That George has done  In a long time  Wow man 
[02:02:00]  Thank you  Thanks  You really loved it  Huh  Well you know  It was great  Being free  To be able to do  Exactly what we wanted  To do  So I don't know  Maybe that's why  It's just purely  One from the heart  It's a lot of fun  And it was a lot of fun  For me to do  And it's very gratifying  That people are digging it  Because it's not a big movie  In any way  It's very intimate  It's more like  Night of the Living Dead  That way  It's a small cast of characters  In limited situations 
[02:02:30]  It's not Thunderdome  Like Land of the Dead  Was getting a little  Too Thunderdome for me  But this film  Seems to be working  What do you think  Of the CGI  And stuff like that  Is that something  Obviously over the years  Computer animation  Stuff like that  In a film  Has that really  Jumped into your movies  Or are you still  A little bit more traditional  I would prefer  To be able to do  Everything mechanically  And on the set  I'm a purist that way  I mean I like  The old King Kong  Even though the thing  Looks like a play  But there are 
[02:03:00]  Just some things  You just can't do  You know  Like we had to  Melt a guy's head down  With acid  And most actors  Don't let you do that  Although they should  We could get  Rich Voss to do that  Exactly  Just drink the acid  And be fine  Alright  As long as I'm a star  But in this film too  We had to work  Very very quickly  I mean we only had  20 days to shoot  This film  Wow  So  And it's all  Subjective camera  And sometimes  You know  If you do it 
[02:03:30]  With a squib  You do a real  Explosive on the head  If you don't get  The shot  The wall is stained  You gotta repaint  The wall  Re-rig the script  The squib  And it just  Sucks off time  So it's much easier  To have the actor  Point the gun  Zombie falls  And you paint in  The gun flash  And you paint in  The blood  It's just  Being able to do that  It just  Just makes the  Production time  On the set time  Much more efficient  Less distracting too  I think  When you're watching  A movie  And you're just  Believing it  Because it looks so real  There's no part of you 
[02:04:00]  That's suspending  Like  I kind of  See the way they did that  You want to just feel  Like you're watching  It really happening  And I think it's less  Distracting when it works  Like that  Sure  Yeah  I mean these are all  Sort of simple effects  I mean it's not like  When you see a bunch  Of dinosaurs running around  You know  That they weren't able  To actually shoot that  So  You know  It sips it off  That it's CG  And I  You know  I have a young son  17 year old son  Who you know  Went to see iRobot  And he said  Eh  Just it's all  It's all computers  Yeah  So I think there is 
[02:04:30]  A bit of disappointment  When you know  When that's all it is  It's just an exercise  Right  Let's take one more phone call  It's Ray in Cleveland  Ray  Hi Mr. Romero  I'm a huge fan of yours  Thank you  I actually have watched  Every Dawn of the  Every Dead movie  You've made  I'm sorry about that  I'm also from  Pittsburgh originally  Hey  Alrighty  And I  And I've been to  Monroeville  I've seen the house  I've been to the cemetery  Oh my god  Holy cow 
[02:05:00]  In fact all  When I'm playing hockey  For tournaments and stuff  So it's kind of cool  Wow  On that ice rink  On the ice rink  In the mall  No  No they actually  Removed that  Last time I heard  Yeah they did  But I didn't know  When you were there  No no no  I've played in  Bethel Park  All them places  But I've made the point  To go to Monroeville  Every time  But you are my idol  And I love you  For everything you've done  To movies  Especially horror films  You're amazing  Well thank you very much  Any questions  No but I think 
[02:05:30]  I'm doing a couple  More of these shows later  Would you call up please  I have one question actually  Okay  You said  I saw a documentary  Where you said  The movie score  For the original  Night of the Living Dead  Was one  The chess game  No the mix  The audio mix  We had to pay  For the movie score  But you know  We paid for needle downs  In those days  They called them needle downs  But we won the mix  The audio mix  In a chess game  One of my  Jesus really 
[02:06:00]  It was real  Guerrilla stuff  I guess  This guy  The guy that owned  The lab  Was willing to play  A chess game  For the mix  And we won it  Wow  Russ Streiner  Russ Streiner  One of the producers  Won it  Oh very cool  Actually Clutch in Baltimore  Has something  Clutch  Hey Mr. Romero  Great talking with you  Hey  I just wanted to let you know  When I saw the movie  As a kid  I truly wanted  To get lost in a mall  While zombies attacked  Because I wanted to play  I know  It was great  Well it was a fantasy  For us  Being there 
[02:06:30]  And in those days  Man nobody  I mean J.C. Penney  Said sure shoot  And they didn't  Make us cover  When they did the remake  You know nowadays  You can never get away  With that  When they did the remake  Of Dawn  They had to use  Fictitious names  On all the stores  Oh really  Yeah so I mean  I think we got  We just sort of  Squeaked in under the wire  Before you know  Lawyers and insurance  Companies insisted  That these places  Stop doing stuff like that  It's amazing  Like a plane crash  Every plane crash  Is like Fred's airline  It's never like 
[02:07:00]  Continental or  You know  Right  Atlantic Star Airlines  They don't want  Yeah they don't want  Anything connected  To them like that  Stupid lawyers  Zombies might come  Into J.C. Penney's  Yeah  I've seen that  I swear  Danny one final question  Before we get George  Out of here  Oh sure  Sure  He's a very busy man  Well there's been  A lot of remakes  Lately  The latest one  In the horror genre  I think has probably  Been Halloween  And it was  It was alright  It did very well  But now there's plans  To do a lot of  Other remakes  Like Friday the 13th  Nightmare on Elm Street 
[02:07:30]  Hellraiser  I think is slated  For a remake  And do you think  That there's really  A need to remake  These movies  Or is it  On the other end  Of that  Is it just  Reintroducing these  Films to a whole  New generation of kids  Well of course  That's the way  They  That's the rationalization  That's how they  Justify doing it  But you know  The kids have seen them  They're on video  And you know  So I don't  I don't buy that argument  I think it's just  The safety of a  Proven title  And Hollywood's  Going to go that way  Rather than  Take a chance  You know  They read scripts  They don't know  Is this any good or not 
[02:08:00]  Yeah just knowing  That they could spend  A minimal amount of money  And get a huge return on it  Exactly  And it has the automatic  Recognition  Of title recognition  It really is amazing  How the writing  Just sucks so badly  In a lot of these  They just keep remaking  King Kong I think  I was happy they remade  Simply for graphics  And they could do  So much more now  But movies like  Nightmare on Elm Street  They don't need to remake  That it was horrifying  The way it was  Absolutely  But it's just some  Some dumb young shit  Some 30 year old  Who's in a position  He doesn't belong in  Who's not a good enough writer  To come up with something creative 
[02:08:30]  And he can't make the decision  To go alright  Well this is good  Let's take a chance  He's just going to steal something  And I think you're very diplomatic  In saying that  No no no  Especially the first  The first three Elm Streets  The third one  I mean  Those were really terrific  Great ideas  They don't need to be remade  Absolutely  You know you can't  Nobody  And the chances of them  Improving or coming up  With better ideas  Is pretty slim  Not Robert Englund  Obviously  They're going to use  A different Freddy  Are they?  I don't think it's been cast  I don't know  I also got to ask you  One more thing  About the end  Of the original  Night of the Living Dead 
[02:09:00]  Case of mistaken identity  Or intentionally shooting him  At the end  I mean  No they weren't  I mean just  Again that's talked about  As a racial issue  And when we wrote the script  In my mind  When I wrote that scene  The guy in my mind  Was a white guy  So it wasn't  People have talked about  They say well  They see a black guy  And they shoot him  That wasn't intended at all  They see a shadow  In the window  They think it's a zombie  And they shoot him  So in my mind 
[02:09:30]  It was always just  Mistaken identity  For a smart guy  He was pretty stupid  Just kind of poking  His head up like that  You know  Yeah  But he's not  He had a hard night  He makes a lot of mistakes  Yeah  He spends the whole movie  Arguing don't go  Into the basement  And that's where he goes  And that's what saves him  Yeah true  You know so  He makes a lot of mistakes  And we're so happy  I'm sorry  No no no  I was just going to say  Thank you guys  It's really been fun  Oh awesome  Nice way to start the day  It's just amazing  To have you in here  When we heard you  Were coming in  We were all just  Giddy 
[02:10:00]  Like a bunch of dumb kids  Giddy  Yeah  Well he hasn't seen  Your film in cancer  Through it  But the rest of us  Were obviously very excited  We walked over here  He was already here  And then Jimmy sat down  With him  And immediately started  Bonding about  You know Hollywood  And stuff  Well you know  When I was in Pittsburgh  Recently shooting  The Kevin Smith film  Oh yes  We were in Monroeville  And they were saying  This is where  George shot  So much of his stuff  And so I figured  That you know  Men of our similar ilk  Yeah  Just talk about  Show business 
[02:10:30]  I sound like Fredo  When I talk about it  He's going to go learn  Casino  But you are a legend  And we were really psyched  And I forgot what a big fan  You are Danny  Any final words  I think we should let Danny  Because Danny is the biggest fan  We should let you close out  The interview with something  A statement maybe  You don't have to  Yeah how about a statement  Throw the paper away  Speak from the heart  That's right  I like your movies  I like your movies  I'm George Romero  And I approve of this  Great  They're good  No need to get overly emotional  Thank you so much  Thank you guys 
[02:11:00]  Absolutely  Thank you  Pleasure meeting you  Great fun  Really really fun  Take a break  So we can take pictures  For God's sake  Don't go yet  No  I'm not going  I want to try the glasses on  The famous glasses myself  Bye guys  We'll continue in just a bit  Opian Anthony  This is George Romero  You're listening to  The worst of Opian Anthony  The virus  You're listening to  The worst of Opian Anthony  How's it going lonely  I want to know how Anthony's doing  Without his cheeky  I'm in my house  Yeah  And uh

[02:30:30]  Doesn't think so  I don't know  I'm not on  Oh you're not on  I turned back on  I don't know  Sometimes it is  Someone  I don't know who it is  Someone in our office  Has bad breath  On a daily basis  So it's one of these guys  It's not  It's after the show  I notice it  Really  So I don't know  Well we eat a lot of  Crazy crap during the show  Maybe it's all just kind of  Bubbling in our mouths  You know here's the test you do  When you smell it  Look at who's addressing you  And that would be the test  That their breath is bad  There you go  How is it a mystery  As to whose breath stinks  You can't just close your eyes  And talk  Hey we got Patrice O'Neill 
[02:31:00]  In studio  Good morning everybody  I'm going to treat you  Like a star  Thank you very much  You deserve to be  Well you  Deserve to be treated  Like a star  I always knew it  I'm just looking  I'm just looking at  Anthony's nasty oral gel  Anthony is  Oh I'm pinching him  Rubbing his stupid gums  His index finger  Trying to be a professional  That's funny  You don't know the half of it 
[02:31:30]  He has oral  What  Look at  Read all the stuff  He's got over there  He's got his oral gel  That's his breakfast  That he never got to  Trying to do his  Dyson impression  Brush your teeth  Anthony  He's got  It's easy  He's got peroxide  He's got oral gel  What's that other thing  Amosol  And a banana  Because he can't chew  Right  And he couldn't even 
[02:32:00]  Try the banana today  Then he's got Advil  And a leave  And what's that  Over there  There's something else  Did I get it all  He got bottles of relief  He's gargling with poison  Because he won't floss  Because he won't floss  Oh my god  Poor Anthony man  Do you like Anthony's seat by the way 
[02:32:30]  Oh this is great man  Usually we give you  I can be comfy in there  Usually we give you  The crappy seat  But look  You got the nice chair  And everything  Look you got  You got your own sound machine  You do whatever you want  Over there  Just start pushing buttons  Let's see if we can find  An impression of  Of Anthony upstairs  If you're going to push the button  They've got to make  Some kind of sense  Wait I see  Oh dear  Oh alright well  Oh so this is all his stuff 
[02:33:00]  What you say is  Push oh dear  You say this is what  Anthony is going through  Right now  And then you hit  Oh dear  Right on the thing  Yeah but set it up first  Go this is  You know  Oh okay  Yeah here you go  Go ahead  Okay this is what  Anthony's going through  Right now  This is my right  No  Wait wait wait  I'm going to do this  What  I'm going to do this  This is my right  There's many like it  But this one is mine  This one right here  Alright  How about you try 
[02:33:30]  For a third time Patrice  Where is that  It says second time  See  See it's not that easy  Being the head guy  He  This is his cold  Just in case  Because he know  He has bad teeth  He had to have somebody  Come in and take his place  And he made sure  It was going to be  Hell yeah  That's not it  Because this is my rifle  This is my gun  No I switched  Alright he switched  This is a guy with bad breath  By the way  What's his name  His brother is hovering 
[02:34:00]  Over me like a vulgar  See how easy  That was Ben  Gargle with this orange  And uh  Yeah take this  On the rocks  Alright try it again  I want this one  Right here man  Set it up though  Go ahead  Okay  Anthony's upstairs  Getting his team done  This is what he sound like 
[02:34:30]  That makes more sense  That works  But it wasn't as funny  This is my rifle  Oh dear  It would have been good  It was really funny  It was after you said that  Watching Nathaniel  Trying to help you  But not bend  Just kind of  Lean in stiff  Take care of that rotten mouth  Alright let's go upstairs  See what's going on  Anthony  Uh yes  Hi Anthony  You guys are a real  Fucking riot  The trees are playing 
[02:35:00]  With my toys  So uh  What's going on up there  Anthony  Well I'm sitting  In the dentist chair  Alright  I've just taken my x-rays  And I'm staring  At the x-ray  Of the um  The tooth in question  Right now  Wait a minute  You got in to see  The dentist that fast  Yes  I'm changing dentists  Immediately  Yeah this guy's pretty good  You didn't have to read  Magazines or any of that crap  No I'm filling out  The paperwork  As I'm sitting in the chair  And actually getting the x-rays  So it worked out pretty well 
[02:35:30]  Did you get the Novocaine  No not yet  I'm still in like utter pain  I'm waiting  They're holding off  I don't know why  Just give me the shot  I need the shot  Why don't you just go  To this guy upstairs  Why don't you just make him  The dentist if he's right upstairs  This is easiest for everyone  I should  You're going to be  Canceling your other appointment now  I don't know  I've got to see  What this guy does  If it's a temporary thing  Then I've got to go  To a dentist  And get it fixed  But if  He knows what he's doing  And it's permanent  Then yeah 
[02:36:00]  This will be my new dentist  Right upstairs  And he's a Jew  The dentist is a Jew  Which is very good  Shocking  Of course  What did Patrice say?  You don't want your dentist's name  To be like Tyrone Smith  Which one of your teeth hurts?  Oh shit  I should have been prepared for that one  We're throwing that Jew berserk  Oh man 
[02:36:30]  That's funny man  Yeah  Yeah like you know  There's some races that are good at doing certain jobs in life  And the Jews pretty much have the dentistry tied up  And I like that  So does this mouth and soil medicine work?  Yeah  No  That stuff down there  Like ambasol and stuff?  No that doesn't work  I don't know what that's for  You've got a little scratch on your gum  Not for this  Hey Anthony  Why don't you tell Patrice  How you were trying to take care of the pain last night?  Oh I had a bottle of Captain Morgan rum 
[02:37:00]  And I was swishing it around by the tooth  And spitting it out in a glass  You know I can't really laugh  You know you want to laugh at somebody's problems  But I had a toothache a couple of years  It's not funny  It's the worst pain you'll ever have  You almost want to dig something in it and take it out yourself  You know what I'm saying?  So I do feel for you  But you've got to brush three times a day Anthony  We were trying to get Anthony to chew on tinfoil this morning  Is he grunting and hurting? 
[02:37:30]  First thing in the morning he's miserable  And Jimmy and I were trying to help him out with some things  We think it's like a popcorn kernel stuck in there  Right up against a nerve  I don't see any popcorn kernel  Oh you're just looking at the x-ray now?  Yeah I'm looking at the x-ray  It's right in front of me  The way they do it now  It's all done with computer magic there  I bite on something  It's got a wire on it  Not like there's any one  And it takes the x-ray  And it pops up on a monitor right in front of your face  Like as he takes a picture 
[02:38:00]  What's he telling you it is or he's not saying it?  No one's in the room with me here  So I'm just staring at it  And it's a big mystery to me  They leave it in front of me for a while  So I could look and go  Ew what the hell is that?  And I don't have any answers  By the way everyone listening in Alabama  Don't get too excited  You'll have that technology in about 20 years  Well they don't really need it  The dentist just looks in at the one tooth  And gives you a prognosis  Well  Prognosis is just not a funny word  Don't say it again 
[02:38:30]  The one tooth that gives you a prognosis  Shut up stupid  Prognosis was the right word though  It wasn't because you're turning red  You got a little uncomfortable there  You got to make me feel better man  I'm looking at my x-ray  I see like the cap thing  And then I see like a post  That's going into one of the root holes  And then I see like two root holes  I don't know how they make heads or tails  Is this your first bad tooth Anthony?  No years and years ago 
[02:39:00]  You know I had to get a couple of teeth capped  Oh okay so what did you do  Like shouldn't you have did the  Like exactly the opposite  So you didn't have this happen again?  No it just came up like two days ago  It just started hurting out of nowhere  Wow hereditary teeth man  Fine and dandy  And then all of a sudden  We were making fun of this is what's creepy  Patrice we were making fun of dentists yesterday  Yeah  And now this tooth that has been fined for 15 years  It acted up  Evil dentist karma  What are you going to do? 
[02:39:30]  If you want me to explain further  We have this pickled punk  And we think the place is cursed  Oh this place here?  Yeah  So that's why I know that sounds like a stretch  But we were talking about how the place might be cursed  Then Anthony starts making fun of this dentist  That was a pervert  And next thing you know Anthony has this problem  The x-ray guy had put  Is that wrong for him to put his mule in my mouth  And say bite down not too hard?  No  I'm in such pain I just want it to go away  So I'm willing to do anything 
[02:40:00]  That'd be so nice if he touches Anthony funny  I really hope I see you on a lifetime movie  And your eyes are open  But you can't move like a serpent in the rainbow  So you know exactly what he's doing to you?  Oh boy  Hey Anthony where's Eric?  Getting his teeth cleaned?  No  No  He's right here  Well we were a little confused when he decided to go upstairs 
[02:40:30]  And you didn't hear this part  We thought we were going to kill two birds with one stone up there  Or is Eric just kind of looking around and going  What is this place?  I've never been to one  What kind of a chair is this?  Oh you're terrible man  As soon as you guys walked in  They probably grabbed Eric  And Eric had to say  No no I'm not the problem  It's that guy  Oh Eric  You're pretty good Eric  Oh God 
[02:41:00]  You're pretty good  Oh you guys make me feel much better  So what  We're just waiting for some kind of  Yeah sorry  I can't  If there were some tools around  I'd start working on myself  But sorry  Until you know  The guy comes in and starts doing it  It's pretty much you know  What kind of magazines?  Fill out my paperwork  I bypassed the whole waiting room magazine thing  And everything  Oh so you're just right in the room?  Yeah that's close enough for paperwork 
[02:41:30]  They're taking my paperwork  Oh I got some other stuff  I got to fill out on the other page huh?  Oops I missed  I've been talking on the radio sir  Maybe I should fill out some of this paper  You get to getting me in trouble  What are some of the questions you got to fill out?  Just the name  Social security number  Crap like that  You fill out all the time  Why are you now seeking dental treatment?  Ow  That's all I'm writing  Patrice do you realize this is a national talk show? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  You're talking about his band  Yeah this is it  This is what we do  Why don't you have Master Poe kick it out?  We got everyone bamboozled  You don't know what caused that?  Wait Anthony's getting his prognosis  I got a little  I got a little infection around one of my  My tooth gum things  Root things  The root  What's this little thing here?  Well  Is that a  Pustule?  Yeah the tooth had a root canal  Mmm 
[02:42:30]  It's reinfected  It's reinfected  There's a dark little shadow around the tooth  Where it's infected  But shouldn't something have started that?  That could be like pulled out of there?  Like what would start an infection like that?  Yeah  I mean I'm quite sure  Alright  A couple of thoughts  Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  Oh are you going to give me Novocaine?  I'll get you numb  Oh he's going to numb me out  What can they do for your tooth though? 
[02:43:00]  What's he going to do for it?  I don't know  He's got to look around  Antibiotics  Yeah  That's it  Antibiotic doc  Does that seem to be with the  Yeah  Right  Oh boy  I think I'm going to get a needle  Ask him how your tooth gets really infected  I don't know  Yeah ask him man  We can learn something today  Yeah like how  What do you do to keep it from getting infected?  What if I bit down on it hard and something  Could that have started this whole ball rolling?  Is it hurting?  If I bit down hard?  No  No probably not  That's why I'm not a dentist  I'm a stupid radio guy 
[02:43:30]  Nothing I did  Oh good  It's not my responsibility  Hey Anthony  A lot of suggestions coming in  Tony from California  Have Ant do a Voss impression  After you get the shot of Novocaine  I won't have a choice  I'm reclined now  And I'm waiting for my  Oh please  My Novocaine  I want to see how wimpy you are  He's got to do the needle live on the air  Oh I hate needles  Oh I hate them  But it's going to make the pain go away  Oh it'll make the pain go away 
[02:44:00]  I love when the pain goes away  Alright what's happening Anthony?  What's happening?  Well he's going around  He's getting all the good stuff  Oh first he puts this two-tip thing  Dips it in some red stuff  And then rubs it on the gum I guess  Hey Ant  Put your hand on the end of the chair  Where his cock can brush into it  Here we go  Here we go  Listen  I'm opening  Yeah  Okay 
[02:44:30]  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Oh  Oh you've got to put your needle  In that nerve  In the back of my jaw  Oh  I hate that one  It makes my whole jaw numb  Is there any one that you like?  And half your throat  Is there one that you like?  No  I thought it was going to be the localized one  But he's putting it in that nerve  That runs in the jaw  But I'm not sure it'll work  It won't work now  Okay  Give me the good one then doc  Here we go 
[02:45:00]  I hate this one  Here we go  You ever have this one up?  Uh  Yes  It makes your  Back of the jaw  And it makes half your throat numb too  Right  It almost  You can't swallow  Oh it's awful  It's  Yeah  You have a hard time swallowing  By the way  Someone is suggesting  You might have Ben's cell phone  Caught in  Under that cap  I hear ya  Alright here we go  Let's listen in  I'm still numbing the thing out  With the q-tip  Okay  Uh huh  Is this numbing up 
[02:45:30]  So it doesn't hurt  When you put the needle in doc?  Yeah  That's to disinfect Anthony  Disinfect  Because I'll be comfortable  But it's a little too late for that  Oh  I'm such a pussy  Excuse my language here doc  I'm not a potty mouth  Oh god  You have XM satellite radio?  You do?  You ever listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh he does  Oh my god  He knows who I am  I hope he's a fan  Oh Jesus  Ask that Jew thief  Is he going to take your insurance? 
[02:46:00]  Patrice shut up  Yeah  Tell that Christ killer  To put more stuff to numbing  Don't work me at lab  Tell that cheap Jew  You're paying in cash  He does  Okay  Okay here comes the needle  Alright  Oh god  Alright doc  Be gentle  Uh huh  As a representative 
[02:46:30]  Of Anthony's family  I say we pull the plug  Now listen for a zipper  Why are we playing the Terry Schiavo audio? 
[02:47:00]  Jesus  God  How much  What happened to Anthony?  How much did you put in there doc?  Hopefully enough  Oh I hope so  By the way  You just said what?  What?  Yes  Maybe I brush my teeth with Novocaine  No that was actually a pretty painless needle that he did there  Oh look at that  Jiggling  That's going to be a great endorsement for the fine dentist  Yeah let me rinse  Oh do you hear that?  That was me rinsing  Is it drooling down your 
[02:47:30]  Not yet  Drooling down your lip yet?  Oh god that one  It's that one that they got to give you way in the back of the jaw  That makes the whole  Oh there goes the tip of my tongue  Okay  Oh this is great  Do you want to buy a dryer door?  Dude you got  I've been drug free 17 years  Oh that is weird  Yeah  It's all going numb now  Anthony you got to do some Dudley Moore  Oh yeah  We can talk about that doc  Yeah 
[02:48:00]  Sure  Yeah  Rue canal got reinfected  Rue canal got reinfected  Three options  Oh no  Here are the options  Try and redo the root canal  Uh huh  If you look at the root  Yeah  It goes all the way down here  Yeah I see  It goes down very far  Yeah  If you look at the root canal filling  It doesn't go all the way down to the end of the root canal  Oh  They didn't take out the whole nerve  Little tissue left in that root  Right 
[02:48:30]  That's what got it  Right  Bad dentist  Uh huh  Oh his body is trying to reject it  Take off the crown  Nice  Take off the crown  Uh oh  Drill back down through the root canal  Delicious  Try to do it again  Yeah  Is that what we would recommend  Yeah  That's what he recommends  Well that's what we go for  I guess the other option is yanking the tooth out huh  The other option is actually surgically going down into the bone  Oh  And actually removing part  Why would we want to do that  Remove part of the bone  Oh okay 
[02:49:00]  But it's an option  It's an option  And the third is  I wouldn't want to say  No either  I kind of like it  Let me talk to Dr. Weinstein for a minute  Why can't you just get rid of the nerve  Are you dissing my old dentist  I just want to ask him that there's a black man questioning his authority here  It's a B cap  It's an A cap  A cap  That's a B cap  Wow the guy's dissing my old dentist  Who put the original cap in  That guy's work  He didn't take the nerve out Anthony 
[02:49:30]  Yeah he didn't take the nerve out  And he didn't  It's a bad cap  It doesn't go all the way over  Jesus  There's probably still gauze sticking out of it  Well that has stunk  Was your dentist named Tyrone  Luke's now specialist  You don't do that huh  What can you do for me like now  Aside from numbing my entire jaw  That's pretty much it  Can you write me a prescription for  Morphine  Morphine I love that stuff  No oh god I'm talking like boss 
[02:50:00]  I swear  No we can hear it  All of a sudden I have  I'm three shades darker  And I'm smoking  Adjust the bite  So I'm not biting down on it so much  Uh huh  Yeah  Little buddy Hinton's gonna come up to me  And go baby talk baby talk  It's a wonder you can walk  When it's time to change  Alright  And should the antibiotic stock 
[02:50:30]  You know  It'll knock it out  It'll knock out the infection  But it  Because when I stop  It'll just come back  If there's some  Umu lakiad  In the root  That was  That was Yiddish  By the way  Okay Italian  I'm trying to make you  My brother here  Help me out  Hey Anthony  Is he gonna write you a prescription  For pain medication  When he's not controlling  The world's banks  Jimmy shut up  Okay 
[02:51:00]  I  Well doc  I probably can't hold this  While you're doing this right  Oh I can  I'm trying to get off  On my own show  And he says it's fine  Wait what is he  Gonna do for you Anthony  He's gonna uh  Fix the crown  So I'm not biting down  On it  Uh so much  Alright  Oh  Hey can  Can you do uh  Some Dudley Moore  No I'm not doing  Impressions  While I'm in the  Dentist chair  Yeah  But in the movie  Ten  Dudley Moore  Went to the dentist  And his whole face  Was numb  And

[03:01:00]  He's  So  Funny  And  Threatening  200  Cars  50  200  Cars  I  Think  It  It  It  Pretty  Crazy  That  He  Turned  A  Brownstone  Into  A  Freaking  Parking  Garage  Five  Years  They  Complicated  The  All you hear is car elevators going up and down all hours  I want car number 32  It's on the third floor  Get me my Porsche  Get it going  I guess I'm  Jerry  You ought to get a  To work here to bring your cars down for  It's a 
[03:01:30]  Jerry  I was reading he has 47 Porsches  47  47 Porsches  Just  Porsches  Yes  You think as the car is rolling he's just thinking 250 million dollars  250 million dollars  What am I doing  What am I doing  Riding a car made of cotton  Really  I hate stories like that because I do kind of like going out and driving  You know  He's driving a car before safety 
[03:02:00]  Like those cars before  Yeah before there was safety  They said about safety  I don't need seatbelts  Yeah he's worth about a billion dollars and he still has the seatbelt that goes across  your waist  It's got the steering wheel that just goes right through your chest if you hit something  at five miles an hour  No safety check  Yeah no airbags nothing like that  Thing of the future  That's the first thing they do in commercial now is just to you know it's got a it got a  Three in safety  And that's the first thing they say  Well they always talk about that drivers passengers back side curtain airbags you know  Airbags pop out of everywhere now 
[03:02:30]  Yeah  Back then you got a metal dashboard  He's driving one of those cars that oil slick come back like a spy car  Or you ever see get smart when it's driving slow and then all of a sudden it just speeds up real fast  The drive slow again  He's driving a black spots car  He probably has a death wish  He's tired  Yeah you think he's tired of the whole thing  Just ah kill me  Jerry Seinfeld should never roll a car  He has enough money to prevent that from happening  I would have loved to have seen him crawling out of the wreckage 
[03:03:00]  Like cause everyone does  You know it really humanizes you and humbles you I think  When you just  I'm crawling from the wreckage  Elaine  Pick me up  I'm on Long Island  Who cut his  Who cut his  Brake line  I'm crawling  It was the  Jerry  They cut your brake line  They're jealous of you Jerry  They're jealous  The  They're jealous  Kramer  Stop talking about the  Just crawling out of one of the windows 
[03:03:30]  One of the busted  Or the windshield or something  I'm crawling out of my windshield  Of my  Fiat  Help me  Were you swerving to avoid a  Jerry  There aren't any of those in the Hamptons  Or a  Or a  Or a  Or a  Or a  What was it  Did you think you saw Bigfoot  Or a  Jerry  Terrible man 
[03:04:00]  Make a great episode  Jerry rolls his car in this hilarious episode of Seinfeld  How scary is that  Yeah it's pretty scary  How do you even roll a car  Never rolled a car  That's usually some type of  You're avoiding something at high speed  Oh and then  Yeah you gotta  No cause he pulled the emergency brake  That wasn't working  So now he  He turns hard right 
[03:04:30]  He was turning hard right  To try to get off the road  And that's what made the roll  And then I guess  The roll stopped right before  A lot of  A lot of traffic  That was flying  Oh really  Yeah this was a close one for him  This was a close call for Jerry  Jerry Seinfeld  Almost got killed  Yeah  That would have been something  Imagine that in the news  We're reporting now  That Jerry Seinfeld  Was killed in a car accident  Oh they'd be doing  All kinds of retrospective  Yeah  He was at a comedy show last night  He went on and  Oh so he's okay 
[03:05:00]  Oh yeah he's fine  He was there last night  It was so funny too  Cause I went on  Last night what a trooper  Kevin Brennan  And it was so funny  He watched Colin get bumped  Oh  That's right  Well  Seinfeld  Seinfeld  Act like you  Act like you  Co-signed for it Colin  Jerry Plyneum  Do you mind if I  I got him  Colin's trying to act like  He volunteered for it  But he really got bitched  That's so good  Yeah I'll take the bump  What's wrong with that  Needy psychotic  Seinfeld  Why would you go on stage  After you roll your car 
[03:05:30]  Why would you go on stage  After you get $250  Why just  What is he doing  I'd go on and take a dump  Every night  And then Tiger  Look you can't come back  Anymore  I know you're Jerry Seinfeld  But you can't do that anymore  The crowd  Jerry just squats on stage  With his fingers up  Taking a dump  And then just gets up  And walks off  Without a word  Or an explanation  And then covers the dump  Up with some money  He throws a few hundred  Like Sonny Corleone  Covers up dump  Covers it up like a cat does 
[03:06:00]  But use the money  He scratches money over  And then just  And then just walks off  Scratches hundreds over  Rolls another car  He just walks away  He's bored obviously  I guess so  You gotta be  You do a movie  You do stand up  And then you want to go back  To stand up  He's a comic  Started this break  Talking about Scott and Todd  And how awful Scott now speaks  And it just so happens  They did their own  Jerry Seinfeld  Bit today 
[03:06:30]  Let's see how that was  You just heard ours  We'll compare what they did now  Okay  You see that story  About Jerry Seinfeld too  Yeah  Yeah he's okay  I guess he was  Tooling around in his  Classic 67 Fiat  One of his many vehicles  Well you know what's funny  Is this is the car  A lot of guys who collect cars  Have like a driver car  As opposed to the ones  That are their real show cars  And fortunately  This was one of his driver cars  That's one of the cars  Can I ask you a question  Obviously tool around in right 
[03:07:00]  Right exactly  Where's the funny part there  Yeah  She's like something funny  About this  You know what's funny  This was one of his driver cars  He's got his cars  That he collects  That he doesn't drive  But this was one  That he takes out and drives  That's really the funny part  Yeah  Well she wanted to talk about  I think the fact  That a lot of times  They have multiple  Quiet hole  Who the hell  Is listening to this crap  Was that done  Yeah 
[03:07:30]  That was it  Well then they have  This part of it  Oh okay  It's a two story building Joe  He has five years  To renovate it  He doesn't care  Now he's got so much money  He's got full time people  That work on it  Yep  How many people  Does it take to  Take care of that many cars  Four or five Patty  You think  Twenty  Jerry  How many does it take  To hold up your face  Rockhead  That stupid  Rockhead  This may be so unnecessary  But that's the difference  Between funny people  And these people  It's just  You can hear the silence 
[03:08:00]  That they were having trouble  Trying to figure out  What to do with this  How this is funny  I'm so glad you brought that up  Like funny people just go  I'm gonna try to make anything funny  I'm just gonna think of an angle  And say it  And actually be attached to it  That is  Yeah yeah  I'm gonna find a funny angle  In this real quick  And just screw around  Or the passionate angle  Or something  Something  They were  It was times where somebody  It was like  It was silence  Yeah  Where they were going  They wanted to just go  Well you know he's safe  So Jerry Seinfeld 
[03:08:30]  Rolled his classic Fiat  Last night  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  He's got a lot of money  And cars  Yeah  Shit  So what  I heard that  I don't know  I heard that  The one he  He drives  That's the one he likes to drive  Yeah  He likes to drive that one  And I also read that he likes to drive  A like a 1980 one  Like a 1980  An 80 Porsche 
[03:09:00]  Yeah  Does he keep that in a brownstone  He renovated  How many people do you think  It takes to run that  How hard is that  Holy mother of God  How hard is that  To do on the radio  What drivel  I think it takes about two people  Because one  He has to bring the ticket  Two people  Yeah  Did someone pick my job  Off the floor  They were just listing facts  Yeah  You know  It's 55  Oh that was our  You know Jerry  That's weird  People don't  He's been retired  The show went off the air 
[03:09:30]  Like almost 10 years ago  Yeah 10 years ago  I saw the final episode  Did you see that one  Well now it's time  For traffic and weather  So that's our  Seinfeld bit  That was good  We're going to do  A loony tune next  That'll waste two minutes  Can we finish up  The second half  Of this wonderful  Jerry Seinfeld  Garage thing  There's more  There's more to it  Yeah  Why did you tell us  Maybe that's when  They get to the funny  Okay  Laughing hats on folks  Laughing hats on  I took mine off 
[03:10:00]  For a second  That's right  Just to make  Everyone uncomfortable  We're going to start  This part over again  Alright  It's a two story building  Joe  Five years to renovate  He doesn't care  Now you got so much money  He's got full time  People that work on him  Yep  How many people  Does it take to  Take care of that many cars  Two thousand  Five patty  Because you got to  Take care of  You know  You got to clean them  You got to do the maintenance  They got to be run a little bit  To keep the engine  That's what  What do you do  On wide drive Porsches  Plus you got to keep 
[03:10:30]  The building up  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And you got  What about all the paperwork  On these things  You know  I have a hard time  With two cars  Just trying to  Which one  Has got the inspection  Well a lot of them  Aren't even registered  For the road  Oh I see  You know  Laughing  Come on  Oh my god  That's the funny part  Right  Is that they were doing  A break  That was  They weren't seriously  Doing that  Attention people  That are working  Their asses off  Listening to our show today  That audio you just heard 
[03:11:00]  Is from a guy  That makes millions  Of dollars a year  Millions of dollars  A year  As you slave away  At your job  What do you think  The paperwork is like  For this  That's  You know  Crazy  Like Jerry's  At Motor Vehicle  Online  Department of Motor Vehicle  Register  Elected register  8,000 cars  Can you imagine  You got to register  All those cars  Yeah 
[03:11:30]  There's  Yeah  How does he carry  All those license plates back  Can you imagine  It's got to get heavy  When you  Can you imagine  The insurance  The insurance  On having  200 cars  Well what about  Checking tire pressure  On so many cars  That's four per car  So now you're  You're quadrupling  Even the number  Of cars  He has  And you're putting  A little air thing  In the stem  I know he's a billionaire  But with cash prices  How they are  Can you imagine 
[03:12:00]  Filling off  200 cars  And the prices  Renovated the building  The building was originally  I believe  A textile mill  Back in 1857  That's where  Can you imagine  The neighbors  They must  My face  My face  Is tired  Oh my god  He didn't even go for  A Kramer Newman  Neighbor joke  Like he just  Disinterested  Totally disinterested 
[03:12:30]  In the story  But why report it  Just  And report like  The most inane  Boring fact  There's an angle  You said he used  To own that building  Yeah  And the angle  On that is  Who bought it  Who bought his  Giant garage townhouse  Like  Like  There's so many angles  To go  It's just like  I'm gonna go down  And see who bought that  I'm gonna go to  The town records  And see who 
[03:13:00]  Actually bought it  Let's talk about  The cars  I'm gonna imagine  The air fresheners  You think  How many  You think  All the cars  Need air fresheners  Or the new ones  Smell nice  Guys  The funny thing is  What's the funny thing  What's the funny thing  Is you  No you don't  Have to keep  Don't you have to  Stardom  What is it  No you don't  The stardom  She probably just saw  48 hours  Yeah  She was worried  Yeah the Porsche
