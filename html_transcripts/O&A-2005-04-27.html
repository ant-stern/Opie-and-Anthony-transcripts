<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM202 broadcast opened with a detailed recounting of Jim Norton's successful HBO half-hour comedy special taping. Opie and Anthony, having attended, described Norton's performance and the surprisingly well-behaved audience,  despite the presence of several show regulars and message board personalities.  They shared anecdotes from the evening, including a near-heckle and interactions with other comedians like Kevin Brennan.  A listener yelled "shit dick" during a quiet moment of Norton's performance, highlighting the occasional lapses in audience decorum.  The hosts also briefly discussed a past incident involving former program director Ron Valeri, a staff "slumber party," and an intern seeking VIP treatment for the taping.  They also mentioned their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" promotion.  Numerous callers congratulated Norton.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to impressions of a show staffer, "Master Poe," with various studio personnel contributing their imitations of his "mosey," physical mannerisms, and laugh.

Comedian Rich Vos joined the broadcast as a guest.  The discussion heavily focused on Norton’s HBO special, including his material (jokes about Terry Schiavo and a cancer patient), and the audience reactions. Vos recounted his recent appearance on Dennis Miller's show, comparing it to Norton's experience. Callers shared their experiences at the taping, describing the seating arrangements and interactions with HBO staff, including a demanding blonde woman.  The conversation broadened to include Norton's past post-show celebrations, the show's dedicated listeners (including "Stalker Patty"), the internal dynamics of the show's crew, and an intern attempting to secure preferential treatment.  Vos discussed his recent tan from vacation, and the hosts joked about Sandy Kane’s return and a large genital wart she has.

Vos further recounted humorous anecdotes from his vacation to Atlantis, detailing miscommunication regarding "power sailing" (actually parasailing), exorbitant prices, and his ingenious coffee-making method using his suit steamer. He also described his observations of the large number of Black people on the beach.  A caller, Benny, criticized the show, comparing it unfavorably to the Howard Stern Show. The hosts playfully engaged with this criticism.  A significant portion of the discussion centered on a critical analysis of Howard Stern, his declining ratings, accusations of plagiarism (specifically regarding a Chinese restaurant prank call bit and the “Homeless Game”), and his perceived tendency to take credit for established radio tropes. Several callers contributed to this critique. Sandy Kane, a stripper, called in, sharing a long and bizarre story about her childhood experiences with dentists and her mother, framing it as a form of abuse.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive humor throughout this segment.  They also briefly mentioned a news story about two six-year-old boys engaging in sexual acts at school.


Sandy Kane appeared as a guest, with the conversation quickly shifting to a detailed discussion of her dental issues, eventually leading to graphic descriptions of her genitals, specifically a growth she called "Twato," and the smell of Rich Vos' ear. There was a comedic breast examination by Jim Norton (using surgical gloves). Sandy's age was revealed via ID card after much speculation. She mentioned past sexual encounters, including an alleged rape by Phil Spector, and her burlesque and public access television work. Sandy performed a song celebrating Opie and Anthony's return.  The segment concluded with further discussion about her physical attributes and living conditions.


The broadcast continued with a chaotic and sexually charged conversation, interspersed with musical interludes by Sandy Kane and James Brown. Rich Vos was again present, promoting his shows.  A significant portion involved Ricky, a hungover intern who had recently had his mustache shaved off. His intoxicated state led to a rambling report on sarcasm, becoming a source of humor. The segment included audio clips of Ricky's intoxicated ramblings, including accounts of a Kevin Brennan and Jimmy Norton show, and his college radio show.  A film crew from FHM magazine was present, filming the broadcast.  The conversation involved graphic descriptions of a woman's inverted nipples and devolved into vulgar jokes about various body parts.

[00:04:00]  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it!  That's terrible.  We will be at the end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it! 
[00:04:30]  ONA Body Rock!  ONA Body Rock!  ONA Body Rock!  You like movies about gladiators?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law. 
[00:05:00]  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Do you want to kiss me?  Hello, exactly!  I'm going to kiss you on the back of the show.  Wow.  Good morning. 
[00:05:30]  Wowie kazowie.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  All right.  We only got, what, two hours left?  Man, maybe.  Can't we just make believe we did two hours and go home and go to bed?  That's not a bad idea.  Oh, my God.  Less work for us.  Oh, I'm not used to this.  We can just make believe we've been here for two hours.  Why not?  We'll recap Jim Norton's HBO thing and we'll go home.  And then we'll leave.  Because we really have nothing else after that.  Oh, my goodness.  So why should we even bother?  Why should we even try? 
[00:06:00]  Why?  I guess it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It is Wednesday, right?  I'm not even sure.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It is.  And then we do this show.  Then we go home just to go to bed to do the morning show tomorrow.  What?  Welcome to the lifestyle.  Welcome to the lifestyle.  Morning radio.  Wow.  Well, it is wow.  We should get that out of the way, even though it's raining.  Not raining everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  I'm willing to go out on a limb and say, I don't believe it's raining everywhere.  Yeah, but it's all about us here in New York City. 
[00:06:30]  It really is.  Selfish idiots we are.  Self-centered asses.  I don't know.  It's winter.  That's all I know.  What?  Everyone showed up in winter coats today.  Yeah.  You got your big, huge winter coat again.  I hate wearing that thing when it's...  We've had days that are almost 90 degrees.  I thought I wouldn't have to wear that anymore.  I come out today and, ugh, just a dreary, jump-out-the-window kind of day.  Ugh.  Cold.  Wet.  I'm a little damp. 
[00:07:00]  Meh.  Are you miserable?  A little miserable.  Yeah.  I had a great time last night, but staying up past my betty-bye time, ugh, even though,  you know, we woke up late, came here late.  The alarm is set in the hotel room, and it goes off, and I'm all confused.  Like, you just, you look at the clock, and you're like, I have no clue, like, what time  it was, and then I'm thinking, why, and I asked my girlfriend, I go, why did you set  it so early?  It was 8 o'clock. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  It went off.  It went off at 8 o'clock.  You're thinking it might be Saturday or something.  And I'm like, no, because I thought, for some reason, it should have been set for a quarter  to 9, because it would have taken me 15 minutes to get here.  But then the show would start at 9, and that would leave no preparation time whatsoever.  I'd walk in, do the show much like Jimmy Norton, just strolling in.  So I was all confused, and then she goes, no, it leaves you 45 minutes once you get to  the studio.  And then it hit me, and I'm like, I've got to get up now? 
[00:08:00]  Because I looked and thought, oh, cool, okay, I woke up, but I still can sleep for like  another 45 minutes.  Yeah.  Nope.  Get out of bed, ass.  You got a job to do.  So I kind of rolled across the street.  Here I am, exhausted.  Okay.  Well, we should tell people it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  One of these Wednesdays, we'll really start promoting the damn thing.  But basically, go to opianthony.com, especially the new listeners, and send in a self-addressed  stamped envelope.  That's how you get to start playing.  And we send out a WOW sticker, you throw it on your ride if you're a fan of the show. 
[00:08:30]  It serves two purposes.  It shows other people, hey, I listen to this show.  I'm a fan of these guys.  So poor people.  And then it's a little extra bonus, you know, if the girls see the WOW on the back of your  ride or your car or whatever, and they feel like it, they're going to flash you as you're  driving around.  They see it and go, oh, I know what that means.  Pull up next to you, a little flashage.  Yeah, it works great.  It's happening all the time.  And to be in the game, you just got to get a WOW on your car.  Simple as that.  So, self-addressed stamped envelope. 
[00:09:00]  The address is up on opiananthony.com, okay?  Right.  But it's not about us today, Anthony.  No.  It's about Lil' Jimmy Norton.  Lil' Jimmy Norton.  What a night he had.  We went to the HBO taping last night of Jim Norton's half-hour comedy special.  And I guess it's going to air in August, Jimmy?  They originally said June, now it looks like August.  We don't know exactly.  They keep changing.  Really?  And I don't even know where to begin.  I guess we should begin by just telling everyone that wasn't there last night,  that Jimmy just destroyed. 
[00:09:30]  Absolutely destroyed.  Yeah.  When you see this, you're going to be floored.  You just killed Jimmy.  Thank you.  And thank you guys for coming.  I know it was like a late night.  Oh, my God.  We wouldn't miss it.  We wouldn't miss it.  I'm going to miss that one.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, he was talking to me and you backstage like it was a chore.  I'm like, are you insane?  HBO, taping.  I mean, of course we're going to be here.  And I've seen Jimmy probably, I was trying to figure it out this morning,  probably a hundred times, Jimmy.  Yeah.  The rhythm and the pacing last night was the best I've ever seen. 
[00:10:00]  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable.  You stepped up to the plate and like A-Rod, you just, you kicked ass last night.  Like A-Rod, huh?  I pulled a little lad out of the street.  Ten RBIs, three homers.  Yeah, I know.  You just destroyed last night.  Grand slam.  And it was just a lot of fun to witness.  And you know what?  Another thing I've got to say really fast, get it out of the way before we really start goofing  because there's a lot of stuff to goof about.  The fans were just unbelievable last night. 
[00:10:30]  Amazing.  I've got to tell you guys, I mean, you just get it.  You get the show.  You just get it.  You know, there are times when, yeah, you know, it's time to be an asshole in a crowd setting.  But you guys all knew how important it was for Jimmy last night.  And you just, you guys came to the plate too, man.  I don't know how because they are just a bunch of animals.  It was a room full of animals that for some reason didn't just rip people's throats out like they normally do. 
[00:11:00]  Scream out shit in the middle of Jimmy's act during an HBO taping.  I completely expected it.  Really?  I am surprised as hell that they didn't.  I'm happy they didn't, but I can't figure out why they didn't.  I thought there would be a couple guys that would have to be slapped real hard.  Yeah, at least.  But I'm telling you, everyone that went just knew this was different and this was really important.  And, you know, and they just came to the plate.  They were great last night for Jimmy.  They were phenomenal, man.  And Kevin Brennan, who did the first show with me, who was really funny, was a little nervous before the show. 
[00:11:30]  He's like, what kind of stuff are they going to yell?  I'm like, dude, they won't really yell.  They won't yell.  They'll be fine.  We got to go backwards a little bit.  Yeah, Kevin taped his half-hour special before Jimmy and technically in front of Jimmy's crowd.  Yeah.  You know, but he was the only comedian willing to do that, right?  The rest of them were a little nervous.  A lot of the other comedians, you know, were a little nervous to do their act in front of an O&A crowd.  Yeah.  Kevin's like, ah, screw it.  I'll give it a shot or whatever.  And he did great.  I love the guy.  I've seen him at the cellar many times. 
[00:12:00]  But he got some advice from you before the show, right?  Well, he was just, like, worried, like, what if they yell?  I'm like, dude, if they yell, just bite their fucking heads off.  He's like, what kind of stuff might they yell at me?  I'm like, he was, like, worried that there's, like, these little radio terms.  Right.  He's like, well, is there, like, a trigger word?  I'm like, dude, it's not the Manchurian candidate.  There are a bunch of psychos who enjoy the radio show.  A trigger word.  A trigger word.  Yeah, can you imagine he's just doing a stupid bit and just happens to have the word shit dick in it or something?  Oh, God.  A trigger word for those animals is, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
[00:12:30]  Please.  He was afraid he'd say something like, and the ace of spades.  I can't feel it.  That's funny.  Much to rage.  Shut up.  Poor guy's got to concentrate on his act, and he's backstage trying to figure out if there's any trigger words.  Trigger words that he's got to stay away from.  That's just going to set the audience into a frenzy.  Stay away from anything with the letter A in it.  Freak out.  They'll rush the stage.  They don't like three-letter words. 
[00:13:00]  No thes.  Drop the.  You know, it was really interesting.  I was walking up, and the crowd was star-studded.  Did you notice some people?  I'm looking around the room as we were walking to our seats and going, look, there's Pat from Munaki.  I was doing the same thing.  And there's the EMT guys that don't like being called EMT guys.  The EMT guys that are officially stalkers of this program.  It's getting a little awkward with the EMT guys. 
[00:13:30]  I like the EMT guys.  And they want to be called what?  Medics.  They want to be called medics.  Yeah, they chastised Ben.  Ben introduced them as, hey, here are the EMT guys.  And they're like, hey, we're not EMT guys.  We're medics.  Calling us EMT guys is like...  And then they gave some kind of analogy that Ben couldn't quite understand.  He hurt and jerked, and off he went.  I never got an answer.  Well, the EMT guys were sitting right behind Ben, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and they're stalkers.  I mean, because it's getting awkward.  Every morning, they're right outside the building, and we have to wave to them every morning. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  They're not saving people anymore.  They're making sure they're in front of the building.  They know when we arrive, and we have to do the awkward wave.  Like, good to see you guys.  It's like, hey, how you doing, guys?  Right.  Glad you could make it.  I like the medics.  Oh, they're all right.  They're good guys.  And then I'm looking around the room, and you're like, hey, look, there's tax cunts, and there's old gravy leg.  There's little Connor's armpits.  And, like, they're just star-studded message board people.  Yeah, I love meeting the new message board guys, and you're like, oh, you're whatever, you know? 
[00:14:30]  You get all excited, like, oh, I know who you are.  And your posts.  I was definitely taken back when I saw Pat from Menachie.  Yeah.  Pat was, and actually, not only that, but walking to dinner in between the two shows last night, the early and late show,  we saw Pat from Menachie's van, and we had to take pictures with it.  I swear.  Dude, look, it's Pat's van.  And there it is.  It has Philbin on the side and all the wow stickers. 
[00:15:00]  Are you a fan of this show?  It's just certain things that are celebrity.  You've said it in the past.  If you put a grapefruit on television and then take it on tour, people will go, look, Pat's the grapefruit.  I think that's an old Dana Carvey bit, actually.  It's just some kind of a celebrity thing that was going on.  Might have picked up on when he said it.  You know, yes.  Yeah, you could just take anything on tour, and it'll become famous.  And people will want to check it out and then get a picture next to it.  You're right.  So Pat's delivery van, I was like, dude, that's Pat's van. 
[00:15:30]  We had to take pictures.  Do you know the one thing that I heard from the stage that was almost a heckle?  It got quiet for a second after the joke, and I hear, ooh!  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, where's Ben?  Cackling before Ben Sparks.  Dude, half the time, I was focusing on you as much as I could, but Ben was in our row,  and he was laughing when you're not supposed to laugh, because you mentioned hookers,  and it just sent him into a frenzy for some reason.  He went crazy.  Yeah, it was your bit about, I guess, Rio. 
[00:16:00]  Rio.  And, you know, how the hookers are legal there.  Yes.  And what is it, three bucks?  Well, it's free to one exchange on the dollar.  Free to one exchange on the dollar.  And Jimmy goes, you know, Rio, or as I like to call it, Mecca.  And Ben just goes, my friend Jamie was with me, and he'd heard, I'd told him about Jim,  and he'd never met Jim, never seen Jim.  So as soon as he mentioned hookers, the two of us just started laughing our ass off. 
[00:16:30]  And then, look, Jim looked right at me from the stage.  Looked right at you and almost started laughing himself.  The only time I almost lost my composure is when I heard Ben,  all he wanted to talk about was your hog, and just started goofing on you.  Look, her, just leave your act and go into just mocking Ben.  It was so hard not to just herky and jerk and goof off.  Well, you did herky and jerk.  On the second show.  Oh, that was the second show?  Yeah, you did it on the first.  Oh, it was on the first?  Okay.  That was funny.  A little herky-jerky for him.  That was funny, though.  You know, I've seen a lot of your act in, you know, the comedy show, but that was funny. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, thanks.  And I was, you know, and I'm with a group of my friends, and then I got Earl in my row.  By the way, Earl was mortified by certain things.  How was he there?  But, man, that was funny.  We were just laughing our asses off.  Yeah, it was an unbelievable set.  It really was.  And you showed restraint, Jimmy.  Because, like you said, how could you not go off on a tangent on Ben and Ben?  Well, if you would have gone that road, the audience would have gotten involved.  But HBO would have been backstage like, what the hell did we get ourselves into?  This is all inside stuff.  I mean, the audience is laughing their balls off, but we can't throw this on HBO. 
[00:17:30]  I had to do stuff that could be left in.  Like, during the late show, there's one point where I do a bit of the military, and I'm in  this car to the soldiers, so I threw in a little pat from Monocular, which the crowd  loved, but that can stay in, because people at home will be like, all right, they enjoyed  his little laugh.  All right, whatever.  It's not too inside.  Yeah, you definitely showed restraint.  Pat almost got a standing ovation during that one.  I know.  He actually waved a little to the crowd.  That's me.  That's me.  He's doing me.  Tipped his insulin.  I'm even hooked on the pat now, man. 
[00:18:00]  I'm trying to imitate him.  Well, you know, there he was, you know, in the audience, like a star.  Yeah.  Like a celebrity.  Like when you pan the seats at the Oscars, and they zoom in on the celebrities, and  Pat was one of those guys.  Everyone's looking over at him.  Look, that's Pat.  What's going on in the line outside, too, before the second show?  Yeah.  I walked over.  I was like, hey, Pat, what's going on?  He's like, oh, it's been busy.  I've been signing things and taking photographs.  And there's people coming over.  I was like, oh, it's Pat from Monocular.  Yeah, you think it'd be signing autographs?  That's awesome.  That's really, really cool. 
[00:18:30]  And then the crowd just yelling out, oh, and a party rock.  When we showed up.  Oh, on a party rock is the war cry.  It's the new war cry.  It's such a faggy war cry.  Let's be honest with you.  It is awful.  It is awful.  That's something.  Someone from the balcony.  Oh, and a party rock.  I imagine that's something that Scott and Todd's fans would yell at them if they even  have fans anymore.  Scott and Todd party rock.  Right.  Oh, just a horrible war cry.  I hope people realize that we're mocking something. 
[00:19:00]  We don't know what, but we're mocking it with that whole O and a party rock.  We're not dressed like guys that should be yelled at with that.  No.  O and a party rock indeed.  Man.  I'm trying to, I mean, there's a whole list of things to get to here.  Standing ovation when Jim walks out.  Yeah.  I mean, did you expect that?  No.  I mean, I knew they did give me a nice hand, but that was kind of overwhelming.  Yeah, sometimes you get a couple of rows or, you know, some of the crowd will stand up. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  They're really fans of the comic that gets up there and stuff, but the entire audience  stood up.  It was amazing and just wouldn't sit down, wouldn't stop cheering.  Well, because I think everyone knew that this was your moment.  They were excited for you.  This was the culmination of you just working on your act to this point, and people got  it.  They just got it.  And they just lost it, and everyone stood up before you even started your act, man.  Yeah, it was really, it was overwhelming.  I mean, I'm not, Patrice actually helped me a lot, because I saw him the night before  he taped, before his first taping. 
[00:20:00]  He was, I mean, you guys know Patrice.  He was, he was nervous, man, and I could see he was nervous.  And he wound up having great shows, and the second show he just destroyed.  I didn't see it, but they said he murdered.  He called me the next day.  He goes, just don't try to be too cool for the moment.  Meaning, like, let them applaud.  Let them do what they want.  He's like, because you know how we sabotage things.  He's like, you know, all right, stop clapping.  He's like, don't, just let it be what it is.  Let it be big.  And Patrice really helped me.  Like, I was self-conscious.  You know, we all have low self-esteem, and they're all applauding for me. 
[00:20:30]  And I'm like, how do you make this stop immediately?  Stop, this is uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  I'm not worthy of this.  Oh, dude, it's a really, it's like they're just loving you, and they're telling you that.  It's like, how do you accept that?  It's really, that's really worth it.  Oh, dude, you handled it perfect.  You just took it all in.  It was nice, man.  What were you thinking just before you hit the stage?  This was it, bro.  I mean, the cameras are rolling, you know?  I hope my breathing is okay.  I hope I can breathe.  Really?  Yeah, because I get this thing where, like, when I'm, I still have it, kind of, where I  can't take a full breath.  I can breathe, but I can't take a deep, deep breath because I'm tense. 
[00:21:00]  Now, what do you start thinking?  What if I just pass out up there?  What if I can't breathe?  Oh, jeez.  Because you get beyond where, you know, I'm not afraid of bombing anymore, necessarily.  It's like, what if I can't breathe?  What if I pass out?  It's all this, like, hypochondriac stuff that you start to get afraid of.  But it was overwhelming, man.  It was just, it was amazing.  It was just, it was emotional.  It was like, ugh, these guys are the greatest.  It was just, I was happy.  I looked out at you guys.  I was happy to see you guys there.  The message boards, all the people that, like, made that little, remember that little  Westside Theater show on 43rd Street with 300 people that, like, you know, Whackbag 
[00:21:30]  and Cringe, and I know opianthony.net yelled at me.  All those guys promoted, got HBO there to begin with, and got this whole ball rolling.  So it was like a real listener thing while we were off the air.  So it was like, it was really weird.  Yeah, this started about a year ago, right?  Even more, whenever that show was.  It was like last February or something like, last year, last February.  It was, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It might have been last February, right.  It was like last winter or something.  Yeah, we were, Ant and I were in no man's land.  Who knows?  We were in no man's land.  Jimmy had to find us. 
[00:22:00]  I think it was, I don't even know.  I think it was in California.  Who knows where Anthony was.  I didn't talk to him for months at a time, and we had to all get back together for this  reunion for Jimmy.  Remember that?  Well, yeah, yeah.  What's up?  What have you been up to, man?  Hey, how you doing?  I used to do a show with this guy.  And then we were awkwardly taking pictures with fans, I remember.  And I'm like, man, we've been out of the spotlight for a year at this point or something.  It was really strange.  But then last night, it all came together, obviously.  That show started the whole wall roll, and it got promoted through all the message boards. 
[00:22:30]  We had no advertising in New York, so that was all the fans, man.  Voss is coming in today, and I think he was the one, as we're all leaving last night,  finally at, I don't know, like 12, 12.30, whatever it was.  He's like, don't forget to, don't let Jimmy off the hook.  He was blowing kisses to the audience.  Did you blow kisses to the audience?  Because I didn't see it.  On the late show.  Voss, you're a tattletale and a scumbag.  Oh, a tattletale, like no one's going to notice in August.  This wasn't a little show in Boston, like it's hearsay. 
[00:23:00]  Dude, I came out, and you have to come out and do a quick, like, encore wave.  It was just part of it for the credits.  So I'm waving, and as I'm backing up, I blew a kiss.  And as I blew a kiss, all I'm thinking of is Voss and Patrice are going to kill me for this.  As it comes off my lips, I know I'm fucking finished, and I can't believe I just did that.  Stupid Voss, though, that's the only thing he had to say.  Obviously, he's very proud of you, and you guys are really good friends.  Oh, but he's completely right, though.  He's completely right.  But that's the only thing he commented on. 
[00:23:30]  He blew kisses to the audience.  Don't let him forget it.  Like I'm Ethel Merman after a show.  Just saying, there's no business backing off.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And when Voss said that, I thought to myself, oh, good.  I'm off the hook.  Because when you mentioned us, which was awesome, and, you know.  Of course.  What can I say about that?  I actually gave you a thumbs up.  Yeah, I think it was.  I like, he, I mean, for the people that weren't there, Jimmy, you know, we were sitting in the audience, 
[00:24:00]  and Jimmy gave us props, and the cameras, you know, obviously the big moment.  Because I saw the lights going up in the theater.  I'm like, hey, why are the lights on us?  Uh-oh.  Like all of a sudden, right over us, the lights start coming up.  I'm like, uh-oh.  Here it comes.  So here comes the acknowledgement or whatever from the stage, and Jimmy mentions us.  We get a really nice reaction.  Thanks to everyone there for that.  And I didn't know what to do.  I'm looking at Jimmy.  Jimmy says, stand up.  So all of a sudden, I stand up, and I just go.  He gave the big thumbs up.  I got to be honest with you. 
[00:24:30]  I looked up, and my arm went out, and I was just ready to put my thumb up.  Oh, were you?  But I held back and gave him the point.  I just pointed at him with my pointer finger.  I went, no, you, Jimmy.  You.  I'm like, you know, you.  It's about you.  Because what are you doing that?  I know it's very awkward.  You want to just wave, but it's too faggy.  Hi.  Kind of turned around, waved to the crowd a little bit.  They were giving us a lot of, yeah, I did the old Broadway bow. 
[00:25:00]  And then.  I did the queen wave.  You did the queen wave?  Yeah, for the people on the balcony, I just did the queen wave.  Kind of shook your hand back and forth a little bit?  Yeah.  Slightly.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  But I gave the thumbs up, like.  Oh.  Hey.  Thank God.  Give him the Fonzie.  I didn't even notice, dude.  I'm sure I'll see it today when I watch the DVDs.  Oh, God.  That would be awful.  You know who got a great ovation when they were seating him?  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  When they were bringing Rich and Bonnie up to their seats, you know, it started a slow 
[00:25:30]  little rumble when he came in, walked through the door, and he's walking up the aisle, and  people just started going crazy for Voss.  And it must have made him feel all good.  Oh, it made him feel great.  Yeah.  You could just see it in his eyes.  Dopes.  What are you making Voss feel good for?  And then the, I don't want to give away too much of the material, but the Terry Schiavo,  Pat O'Brien thing killed.  Oh, yeah.  I had to do that.  I was never going to do that.  And that was, like, more inside for the fans.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  That was one of those things where the crowd just went crazy, man. 
[00:26:00]  Jimmy has one of the best bits on Terry Schiavo.  I think he actually did it on the air, matter of fact.  And that's probably where it was born, actually, was on the air.  Somebody just threw it out on the radio.  You did it on the air.  It's one of the best, like, looks at that whole situation.  And then you threw in the Pat O'Brien sex tapes, some of the famous lines from the  sex tapes.  Yeah.  And people just lost their minds.  Yeah, that's probably my favorite moment from the show, was the Pat O'Brien lines.  Yeah.  Something just for the fans.  And people in the middle of America will watch and go, what do you mean, you're so  fucking hot?  What does that mean?  But whatever.  Jimmy Danza took a few applause breaks during the show. 
[00:26:30]  People are saying.  Jimmy Danza.  Yeah, amazing.  Just people going crazy.  And you didn't want to step on the applause because your instinct is a comic because, again,  you just want to barrel through.  But it's like, you just got to be in the moment.  Just hold it.  Yeah.  And the tagline.  It was like, you know, you just got to do that.  You can't just go, and stop them from clapping.  I was just happy.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Stop clapping.  Because then they might just go, all right, well, fuck off.  We'll just kind of sit here, stupid.  Yeah.  They'll show me who's boss.  Just stare back at you, idiot.  And then when you came out for the encore or whatever, the encore, what was that called? 
[00:27:00]  Like an encore?  Just a quick wave.  You go in for five seconds.  A curtain call.  A curtain call.  And then Jimmy came back to another standing ovation.  And then you leave.  What were you thinking after the first show?  Oh, thank God that's done.  Now, one more to go.  One more.  Thank God that went well because now there's no pressure for the late show.  Yeah.  That's what we were all saying backstage.  Everyone was telling to Jimmy, man, you can pretty much coast on the second one now and  have fun up there because the first one just destroyed.  Well, they both destroyed.  Big Rich is saying, we went crazy about the boss thing. 
[00:27:30]  We were exploding in laughter because the boss was seated all the way in the back of  the theater and you guys had great seats.  It was funny that like boss was walking in and he just kept walking upstairs.  That's right.  He kept going higher and higher.  He was like in the nosebleed seat.  He had the worst seats in the theater.  Oh, God.  We just don't take care of each other.  Because remember when boss had his big moment at the Donald Trump roast and he invites  Anthony and I and we're thinking, wow, you know, boss has got a lot of heat these days. 
[00:28:00]  He's going to be one of the guys, you know, roasting Donald Trump.  We have to have good seats.  Of course.  We had the worst seats in the house.  Boss.  We actually had to find an elevator.  We were the only table that had to find an elevator at the Donald Trump roast.  Yeah, to watch the roast.  Behind that TV monitor up on the top.  You know, I finally got my pictures printed out.  Actually, the pictures I gave you yesterday.  I finally got him off my digital camera.  And there's a picture of Anthony and I's seats at the Donald Trump roast.  I've got to get that online. 
[00:28:30]  It's hilarious.  You can't even make out Donald Trump in the distance.  You can't even make him out.  So, all right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  When we come back, we'll go right to the phones because a lot of people want to congratulate  Jimmy there.  Sure.  On the HBO taping last night.  And we've got to get to some other things.  Oh, my God.  There's just so much.  I'm trying to sleep.  Like sleep?  Well, yeah.  That's later.  Yeah, we've got to get into the Ricky thing, I guess.  The whole gang.  He's supposed to do his report today.  He's got a report on sarcasm. 
[00:29:00]  And also, I guess they shaved his mustache last night because he was really drunk.  I heard there was just a wing ding going on here last night.  There was some kind of shindig.  Well, I got into the office at, I don't know, 8, 8.15, whatever.  And Danny was just waking up.  On the couch, I usually sit on.  Who's that chick?  That's donkey sausage.  Donkey sausage making out with Ricky?  Making out with Ricky?  Wow.  That's a fake kiss.  You can tell by Ricky's lips.  Are you sure?  Yeah, positive.  How could you tell by Ricky's lips?  Why?  It doesn't look professional like you would think he would be kissing? 
[00:29:30]  You can tell, dude.  He's not even attempting to soften up or anything.  Well, we'll hear the story.  And then look at Danny.  Jesus Christ, you bunch of drunks.  Yeah, it was like a slumber party here.  Steve called me and goes, you're not going to believe this.  The office stinks.  Danny slept here with his shoes off.  Oh, no.  So I open the windows and kick him off the sofa.  And they all slept here.  It was a slumber party.  Derek slept here.  Ricky.  An intern slumber party.  Great.  There's photo evidence of things that were going on. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And I get a message from Nathaniel the other night.  Like, I'm so panic-stricken about this.  He's like, hey, it's Nathaniel.  We got tickets.  You think you could do something so we don't have to wait in line?  The intern's wanting VIP treatment on the way in.  They're all partying and drunk.  It's a fucking madhouse.  I'm sure that was top priority on your thing to do.  I almost threw the phone, but then I'm like, I have to save this just so we can get it onto...  Oh, you got it?  Oh, of course we do.  Of course.  Oh, we got it here.  We have it right here?  Oh, my God.  I got to listen to this.  And then we got Ricky decided to record himself when he came back here. 
[00:30:30]  That's great.  Oh, yeah.  Tons of good stuff.  Very good.  Want to hear it.  Okay, we'll get to this after the break because it's good stuff.  Ben, really fast.  What was up with the Master Poe thing?  I don't...  Eric, what was that again?  I don't...  Eric saw it and...  Well, Eric did a great job.  He gave me a bunch of bullet points here about Jim Norton's HBO tapings last night.  And one of the things in the first taping, Master Poe taking photos with audience members  and discussing the aspects of the show points Ben out to fans when obviously he didn't want 
[00:31:00]  to be noticed.  Ben wants to be noticed the least on this whole...  I was with a group of my friends.  It was a group of us, you know.  So I brought a bunch of my friends and we were all sitting there.  And then they had the four seats next to us for you guys.  And Poe, I don't remember because Eric was sitting behind us and I'm talking to one of  my friends who was getting harassed by one of the listeners, took a photo of him and was  harassing my friend who then decided that he thought he was going to kick his ass.  So I had to calm down that these are just the wackos that we deal with. 
[00:31:30]  And then Poe decided to announce where I was sitting and Eric, I was like, aww.  So I don't even really remember.  Poe was sitting at the end of the row that I was in and until you guys came in and some  other seats they reserved, they had seat fillers.  They were students from NYU.  Two seats behind us were filled by the seat fillers and leaning over and one guy recognizes  Poe and he goes, oh my god, that's Master Poe.  And these two guys are freaking out.  They're like, oh my god, Poe.  Poe goes, yes, yes, gentlemen, how are you?  And he's shaking hands, right? 
[00:32:00]  He does Master Poe well.  That's pretty good.  So he's shaking.  By the way, everyone here has their Poe impression.  Everybody in this building does a Poe impression.  So he's shaking hands and everything and the guy's like, I got to get a picture.  Sure, sure.  So, you know, they lean up in the row there and, you know, they're punching fists, taking  the photos.  And the two guys are just talking about the show.  Oh, you're incredible.  The show's great.  It sounded better than it was at any time.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, those guys are, they're really, they're just outstanding.  They're professionals.  They really polish their craft and all this, right? 
[00:32:30]  And so then he goes, oh, but if you want a real treat, and then he leans over to the  second row and he goes, that's Ben right over there.  And Ben goes, oh, great.  Hi, how you doing?  And then Ben turns around real quick and just ignores everybody.  Blew up his spot right there.  You know, I'll blow up Ben's spot and Steve's spot.  They hate the fans.  Yeah, Ben's not outstanding people.  They really just don't like you guys.  Ben hates you people.  So does Steve, yeah.  Steve and Ben can't be bothered. 
[00:33:00]  I just want to be left alone.  I don't want to talk to anybody.  Steve hates the fans so much, he didn't even show last night.  Eh, I couldn't make it.  No, I know.  I shouldn't do that to him.  He was stuck in traffic.  But who else does the master poem impressions?  Maybe everyone should step forward.  Who does a master poem impression?  The interns.  Yeah.  All the interns do one.  Who else does one?  Who wants to step up to the mic and do their master poem impressions?  Steve does probably the best one I've heard.  Oh, really?  Out of everybody so far.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, Steve does a really good poem impression.  Steve, I know you couldn't make a lesson.  I was just...  No, I know, I know.  No, I was really...  I haven't driven into the city at around like 435 in a while, and I just underestimated  the traffic completely.  Yeah.  So, anyway, um...  What else?  Oh, there's Paul.  Yeah.  You can't be in there.  I don't give a shit.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  First of all, Poe does not walk.  Poe moseys. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  That's true.  I've seen it.  He's got a walk that sort of...  He's got both hands out like this sometimes, and he'll put one leg, sort of bow-legged  out in front of the other, and walk, you know, sort of like this.  Yeah.  It's good visual.  It's almost like a keep-on-truck-and-walk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's accurate.  That's very accurate.  And, um...  Let's see.  I need someone.  Eric, stand right here.  So, say you're in a room.  When Poe walks into a room, he seeks out the person that might physically be the biggest 
[00:34:30]  threat, and he walks up to them, folds his arm, puts one leg in front of theirs, and  goes like this.  Like to...  As to block the guy off.  As to block the guy off.  Uh-huh.  Um...  He does like a genie pose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Genie pose.  With the arms folded.  Yeah, well...  And his shoulder is now against the threat's chest.  Steve does some good radio descriptions, though, and he does this.  And he does this.  Look.  Sorry.  I apologize.  Yeah, he folds his arm in sort of a genie pose. 
[00:35:00]  Uh, then...  Oh, yeah.  Poe loves hot chocolate.  We didn't know this.  Yeah.  Ooh.  When Poe first...  The hot chocolate fan, Poe.  Yeah.  When Poe first got here, he was enamored with the hot chocolate so much that he described  it as phenomenal.  Gentlemen, you had that hot chocolate yet?  The hot chocolate here is phenomenal.  Let me get you some.  You know, so when...  Every guest.  Every guest.  So, so, the guests are all treated to a warm cup of hot chocolate. 
[00:35:30]  Uh...  Let's see.  Oh, that was great.  There's this...  Uh, walking into a room...  Oh, well, the, uh...  The, uh, the...  The greeting that most people get is the fists together...  Right.  ...and the...  Oos.  So, when...  I don't know what the fuck that means.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's what?  It's a respect term.  Oh, it's a respect term?  Okay.  I see him doing it every once in a while.  I don't really know what it means.  I think it's a martial arts thing.  So, the fist in front of him, and then he just bends slightly forward.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  Now, give me, uh, give me an answer to this.  Um...  All right.  Uh, Poe?  Thanks, man.  I'll see you.  Yes, Anthony.  I'll see you Monday.  Anthony, have a good weekend.  Anthony.  That is, like, a great Poe voice, man.  That's really good.  Uh, he gives the fist, and, yeah, have a good weekend, gentlemen.  Uh...  I love it.  There's the, uh...  Oh, there's one...  I'm missing something.  I am missing something.  Yeah, it's gonna be your teeth in a second.  Look at that.  Oh, he's not gonna do it.  He's giggling.  Look at him.  Uh, he's enjoying this, because I've actually... 
[00:36:30]  I studied this.  Oh, and I party rock!  All right.  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, what am I missing?  Uh...  The fable cry of last night.  Shows karate movies now, but that's not really an impression.  Well, uh, he's always training...  Oh, he's always training Mars in the other room.  He's always showing Mars how to do a death grip on somebody.  Marsolino, allow me to show you this new takedown move I have perfected in one night.  You could kill somebody with this paper clip.  Allow me to show you how to defend yourself against a nun with a frying pan with this paper clip. 
[00:37:00]  I, you know...  The most innocuous of threats, apparently, can be dissolved with a piece of paper folded in three.  Yeah, he was telling us that one.  You could kill someone with a piece of paper.  He certainly wouldn't challenge him on it.  And, uh, yeah, that's, uh, the mosey, the talk, the...  You got it down pretty good, Steve.  Yeah, you know what, it's just, you know, he's a very...  Oh, that's it.  The Buddha laugh.  Uh, Paul laughs like, um, like a wise old Buddha sensei.  Like a, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:37:30]  That's how Paul laughs.  And you can hear it across the room.  Yeah, yeah.  When Paul's amused by something, it's ha, ha, ha, silly human, you know.  Very good.  And that's how...  And that's Steve.  Very, very good.  You've studied.  Yes.  And you enjoy that.  Now I'm looking forward to seeing what Paul does when he punches a change-purse stomach.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Paul loves me.  Of course.  Who doesn't love cuddly bear like Steve?  And there they go.  Master Paul and the... 
[00:38:00]  Best of friends.  And the Impressionist.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, we should take a break.  We'll go right to the phone and see what, uh, people have to add to the, to this show last  night, okay?  Yeah.  All righty.  Like signs through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  What can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off.  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C. 
[00:38:30]  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their cars.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right, okay, whatever.  I got to go.  Please, I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that 
[00:39:00]  he placed on us.  How do you get to tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude. 
[00:39:30]  You're so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  I've been down.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented.  I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  I killed himself.  I've done it all.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked it up.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier. 
[00:40:00]  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw him?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car? 
[00:40:30]  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a butt, Mr. Robin.  I invented the traffic accident.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called the fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care. 
[00:41:00]  I don't care.  I invented that.  That was me.  Robin and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  Oh, yeah.  King of the heart is in a dark.  Oh, yeah.  Baby.  Oh, yeah.  King of the heart is in a dark.  Oh, yeah.  I think I fell asleep for a minute there. 
[00:41:30]  Did you really?  Yeah, I leaned back in my chair and my eyes were, like, shut.  We got a lot of energy, though, so far.  Yeah, hopefully we can keep it, you know.  It's just a weird day for the show.  It's a very, very, very happy day for everybody.  Of course.  But, yes, it was kind of a long day, you know?  Yep.  Yesterday got up at 5 and went to bed around 1.  Almost up 24 straight hours.  And, you know, one night's sleep doesn't take care of the sleepiness.  So, it is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  If you're looking for your WOW stickers, go to opiananthony.com.  The address is up on the site for you to send in your self-addressed stamped envelopes 
[00:42:00]  so you can get the WOW stickers on you, on your cars and trucks and stuff for the spring and summer, all right?  There you go.  All right, where were we?  We got sidetracked there a little bit.  Oh, we were going to go right to the...  We were all over the place.  We were going to go right to the phones, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Jersey, who actually has been waiting to talk to Jimmy for an hour and a half.  Are you kidding?  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Hi, Dennis.  Hi, Angel Eyes.  I just want to tell you that you were awesome. 
[00:42:30]  It was the 16th time I've seen you.  Wow.  And I just want to tell you, I'm a comic in Jersey.  I've been doing it seven months, and it was the equivalent of seeing the Beatles on Al  Sullivan last night.  On who?  The Beatles on Ed Sullivan.  Oh, thanks.  Did he say Al Sullivan?  I've been watching you that much.  I can't get my thin bird lips to get words out.  Oh, thanks, man.  But I just want to tell you that I really, dude, everything in your face when you walked on  stage and you got that big ovation after I yelled shit dick during that quiet moment.  Oh, that was you? 
[00:43:00]  I was right next to Pat from Wiennake.  Okay.  I was right next to you guys, and you guys walked out, and everybody went nuts.  I mean, this show is amazing, and somebody needs to tell Rich Voss he's a dummy.  We love Rich, buddy.  He walks in the line for the second show, and he goes, somebody went, hi, sweetie.  And he goes, I have little midget hands.  We go, nice comeback, dumbass.  He was so embarrassed.  Voss has-  His fiancee walked away from him.  Voss has some great stories we'll get into when he gets here. 
[00:43:30]  I think he's going to be here within 10, 15 minutes.  So you were the shit dick guy.  I was going to bring that up.  Because like Anthony was saying earlier, he wasn't sure if the audience was just going  to be just a bunch of dicks.  Animals.  And we gave you guys your props.  You knew how important the night was, and you went with it, and it was awesome.  But the warm-up comic who did a great job-  What's his name?  Drew Frazier.  Drew was really, really funny.  He was getting the crowd going before Jimmy and the rest of the comics hit the stage.  Anyway, so he quiets everyone down, and now HBO is rolling tape. 
[00:44:00]  Here it is.  Here we go.  We're starting the HBO taping.  Ready for the big intro.  Ready for the big intro.  Ladies and gentlemen, HBO presents the big intro, so you need that silence beforehand.  Yeah, so they're rolling.  They're now rolling, and all of a sudden, it was you, Dennis.  You go, shit dick.  This just echoes in this auditorium.  Shit dick.  And the place comes apart.  Just loses it.  And this was the late show, right?  Yeah, it was there.  And there was a little concern backstage.  Jimmy was feeling a little bit, too. 
[00:44:30]  He was like, well, you know, it's a late show.  It's an O&A crowd.  They've got to be hammered.  You know they're drunk.  Are they going to be able to focus for this, you know?  I mean, they're going to have fun, obviously.  And that was the moment where I'm thinking, oh, this could get a little interesting, because  everyone just starts laughing hard.  And that usually starts it.  Then the next thing is Chester's liver or what have you, you know?  Keith the cop leaned over to me at one point and said, he goes, did you notice the smell  of alcohol in this room during the second show?  You know, the first show we went in, saw it, and then we come back, and Keith just leaned 
[00:45:00]  over and said, the smell of alcohol.  You could smell it in the room.  Nothing like smelling alcohol and bad breath at the same time.  Drunks.  You drunks.  So then the guy has to kind of make an announcement, and as he's making the announcement, you can  hear his voice that he thought was pretty funny, though.  He's like, look, you can't, I forgot what he said, but basically, you know, you can't,  please don't yell out anything.  Yeah, tape is rolling, and you're just going to screw it up for the comments.  Yeah, there you go.  Okay, yeah.  But he had to make the announcement because of you, Dennis.  Thanks, guys.  Punch it out. 
[00:45:30]  Thanks for coming, man.  There's Dennis from Jersey.  Let's go to Steve from Staten Island.  Steve, what's up?  This is Pete from Staten Island.  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, I just want to put him on.  Great job he did last night at the show.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  You were a star.  I sat in the row just before O&A to their right a little bit.  What's that?  What did he say?  He sat in the row just before O&A to the right a little bit.  Oh, that's my next question.  He's kind of telling us where he sat. 
[00:46:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  Steve, any highlights or what?  I think it was Anthony was just saying how everybody reeked of alcohol.  I don't know who all the guys were sitting around me, if they were all your interns and  everything, but my wife and I were like, wait, these guys really stink.  We went up in a late show.  Apparently so.  They were drunk, too.  They ended up sleeping here last night.  I'm wondering how many guys brought their wives or girlfriends and they had no idea what  they were about to see.  No, I know.  My wife doesn't really listen to you guys. 
[00:46:30]  I try and get her to call all the time to play Guess What's in My Pants and they stick  her on home for too long.  Oh, really?  And she never gets through.  Ah, bastards.  Well, we're going to be reaching for material today, so maybe we'll get her on today.  I hope so.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  There goes Steve.  Let's go.  Oh, before I forget, I've got to thank Eric Logan and NXM.  They sent me a nice cheese box.  It was like a little weird box of cheeses and well-wishings.  You did.  Yeah, and Logan called me at home just to say good luck, so thanks, man. 
[00:47:00]  It's very appreciated.  That is very nice.  I just had to say that before.  I forgot.  Logan is just awesome.  He's phenomenal, dude.  He's just amazing for us.  He really is.  I mean, Anthony and I are not used to someone that is in management that actually supports  the show.  We're just not used to it, so we're trying to figure this out as we go.  Because we're used to just being very defensive and working with people that just don't get  it.  But Eric Logan, man, he's like the biggest fan of this freaking show.  So I assume he has an ulterior motive and he's lying.  Yeah, exactly.  I know, exactly. 
[00:47:30]  He can't possibly be in management and be like a cool guy.  That means he'll probably be leaving the company within two or three months.  That's usually the case.  Because, I mean, in the past we've had people that could have been the guy and then all  of a sudden they're packing bags and boxes in front of us.  The famous Ron Valeri story is just unbelievable.  You know, Anthony and I are working at BAB.  We get the big, the call to start our real radio careers together.  You know, a full-time slot for both of us.  Yep.  Doing afternoon drive up there in the Boston area. 
[00:48:00]  And the guy who hired us, who kind of discovered us, was this guy Ron Valeri, who was the PD  up there.  And he was coming down to Long Island every weekend to see his wife or his wife's family.  There was something going on there.  And he heard Anthony and I on the radio, basically, and went, whoa, I want these guys bad.  So he was the one who hired us.  And we were pretty excited because he had a name in the business at the time.  And we get up to Boston.  And what, within two weeks?  Not even?  Not even.  Like, I think we commit ourselves to make this move, okay? 
[00:48:30]  And it's very important to work for a PD that gets it.  And to work for the PD that hired you.  Right.  Because in radio, when they bring in new guys, the old guys that the old PD hired usually  get fired.  All of them get fired.  So the PD can bring in his guys.  Right.  It's kind of like when a coach comes in and he wants to bring in his coaching staff.  Or when the head of the mob guy gets killed and there's a new guy, eh, he brings in his 
[00:49:00]  boys.  So we are so excited.  We go up to Boston.  We're about to begin this gig.  And we sit down for our first meeting with the program director, Ron Valeri, who went way  out of his way to hire us.  We're in his office.  And we notice his office is a little stark.  Yeah.  And there's boxes around.  There's boxes all over the place.  And, you know, he was pretty much telling us, you know, welcome to Boston.  Welcome to the station.  You're going to love it here.  And he's just kind of casually, like, taking things off his wall and starting to throw 
[00:49:30]  them in his boxes.  Yeah.  Like, what's going on?  And it turns out he got hired to be a program director here in New York City.  Yeah.  So he was leaving.  He was leaving.  And that's when they hired Dave Dickless.  From the middle of fucking nowhere who just, just never got it.  Just never got it.  Yeah.  So.  Wow.  Where did that come from?  Oh, yeah.  Elo.  Oh, yeah.  So Elo gave you the basket.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Dude, I just wanted to thank him.  Just, it was just fantastic to get that call.  And it was just really, really supportive. 
[00:50:00]  Very nice of him.  Yeah.  He's great.  Let's go to Mario in Brooklyn.  Mario.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Jimmy, you ripped it last night.  Thanks, Mario.  It was excellent.  I don't know how you'd speak so eloquently and talk about Terry Schiavo, but do you think  that stuff would make the HBO special?  Well, I have, I don't know how much of the final, I mean, HBO obviously has final say,  but they give the comedians quite a bit of freedom on what set we want to use, on what  we want to cut out, because I have to cut like 10 to 12 minutes out of each set,  because it's got to be 25 minutes. 
[00:50:30]  27 minutes.  As far as, Opie was just talking about, you know, how many girlfriends had no idea what  to expect, I had to give my girl a warning as far as, you know, Jimmy's cancer jokes,  because her mom is suffering for cancer right now, so.  Oh, boy.  I had to, you know, lay that in just, you know, as a warning.  I really didn't do any cancer, I just did the one cancer reference, cancer patient shitting,  which, you know, that was just kind of, not really a cancer patient joke. 
[00:51:00]  But, uh, congrats.  Had I known, I would have done more.  Yeah.  I hope the, um...  Nice, buddy.  The Terry Shivo material is, I mean, so harsh, and so funny, I just pray HBO doesn't get  a little, uh, a little scared about that.  HBO is pretty damn good with letting the comics do whatever the hell they want, man.  Yeah, you gotta think that's the, the one bit, if, if they're gonna have a hair on their  ass, that's the one, right?  Well, the only, the only standards questions they had was anything that might libel them,  like, with, right, names.  Okay. 
[00:51:30]  That was it.  Any name I mentioned, they had to verify if this person did do this, that's, they don't  open themselves a lawsuit.  Right.  That was it.  There was not one content mention for any of it.  Yeah, they really don't.  I've seen, um, HBO comedy specials.  They had, some of them, they, they let the comics say whatever the hell they want.  Absolutely, there was not one mention of content other than, oh, hi, Rich.  Look who's here.  Hey, Butterfly.  Man, you killed last night, it was great.  What's up, Rich?  It was great.  Thank you, man.  Oh, God.  I gotta tell ya, you know, I gotta get right into it. 
[00:52:00]  Everyone was commenting how tan you are.  You are the tannest individual ever.  And you got, and I know you got back from Atlantis at least a week ago, bro.  I can't get a cab, I try to get a cab here.  That's wrong, I can't say that.  Look at this contrast between Jimmy and Boss.  You are so dark.  Thanks.  Well, it's brutally hot and sunny down there.  Wow.  Get your hand off me.  Why?  It feels good.  You know what?  When I walked in, I thought Jimmy was gonna throw me a kiss.  That's a good way to end it, Joe.  What are you, Carol Burnett? 
[00:52:30]  Jesus Christ.  The guy kills.  Yeah.  And then I'm fucking him in the ass.  Bye.  What's wrong with you?  Dude.  And then I'm smashing her head against a brick wall.  Love ya.  As soon as my hand left my lips, I thought of you and Gummy.  Even in my finest moment, I have to think about my friend shitting on me.  Jesus Christ.  Awful comedians.  What are you, fucking Kennedy in Dallas?  Throwing kisses?  You're the new Pope? 
[00:53:00]  Jesus Christ.  You just talked about rape material for an hour.  Love all of you.  I love you all.  He was overcoming my emotions.  No, he didn't.  How do you know he was blowing a kiss from the seats you had?  I love that top.  I'm not gonna sit down there in the middle and be seen in the audience.  I'm a fucking celebrity.  Be seen down there.  You're fucking, that crowd was great, huh?  Weren't they awesome?  They were on fire.  You walked out with Bonnie and everyone was giving you your props big time,  but then people started laughing because you just kept climbing the stairs higher and higher and higher. 
[00:53:30]  Well, that's what we saw for Patrice, too.  Well, that was because of the smell, but...  Ooh.  No.  It's just...  You don't want to sit down.  Well, because during tapings, comics, it's hard for us to sit down.  We want to kind of like even stand to the side or something, you know?  You want to shadow box along with the comic on stage.  No, that's my bit.  If a comic shadow boxes before he goes on, he stinks.  That's like if you're going to have heart surgery and you look over and a surgeon shadow boxing,  you're fucking dead.  All right?  Big C from New York says, 
[00:54:00]  Voss looks like C. Thomas Howell in Soul Man.  Ooh.  There you go.  I did get a lot of color.  Speaking of, you know, I don't want to do any...  Speaking of black, but I was watching the news this morning again,  and this little black girl, you know, the fifth grader got handcuffed.  Everybody's in an outrage, but isn't school supposed to prepare you for your future?  I mean, you know, you recovered from going, isn't school proposed to...  That's a good joke, though. 
[00:54:30]  You can recover from that.  I know.  I just woke up late because of my dumb phone.  I have an alarm on my phone, but I forgot last night I said it on vibrate,  but I didn't hear it in my ass.  And I'm Wendy Lieber now.  I'm doing all my punchlines.  God, did you kill this.  It was so much fun.  No, but he was...  You know, listen, we used to do gigs at open mics, like in Red Bank.  There was a little club, the Laugh and Bean, and we would go down, right, do gigs, you know, for free. 
[00:55:00]  It was a coffee house, right?  And this was what...  You know, I say, what, 10?  92, maybe, 93?  I don't know.  It was...  I was just getting divorced, I think.  You know, you'd go down, and, you know, we would always go, me and him.  And from that to doing an HBO special, I mean, you know, that's a lot of cock to suck.  You know, something just transpired here that is just beyond me. 
[00:55:30]  You were just handed a note, Rich.  Uh-huh.  Look what it said.  No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.  What?  Don't even start digging.  Eric just handed Rich a note that says, need money for your food.  Now, I'll bash Rich along with the next guy, but he is a guest on the fucking show, helping  out.  He's coming in here free of any, you know, financial gain.  How does the show not pay for Rich's fucking food?  Nobody has money out there.  That's why.  Everyone's broke. 
[00:56:00]  It's an egg sandwich and a coffee high roller.  Yeah.  I'll get that.  Maybe when we go out to dinner, you can get...  There is no way any guest coming in on this show should have to pay for their own food.  They never do.  I was just told, ask Rich for money for his food.  Nobody has any money out here.  Okay.  It depends on the guest, Anthony.  You want to start, you know, paying for Stalker Patty's breakfast all of a sudden?  No, because that's not a guest that's coming in that, like...  No, it's a guest.  No, no, not Stalker.  There's a definite line between a Rich Voss and a Stalker Patty.  Yeah, you'd fuck Stalker Patty. 
[00:56:30]  I'm just saying, you know, not to pump up the guy's ego or anything.  Let's go back to...  Oh, shoot, we just lost Mark.  Mark?  Yeah, he was waiting a while.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Jimmy rocked last night.  Jimmy, you killed it.  I felt like a grandparent watching his retarded kid graduate college.  It was just like, ah, it was phenomenal.  It was just like, your timing was great, man.  Congratulations.  Thank you, man, very much.  I hope the audience took care of you.  They were phenomenal.  I could not have asked for better crowds either show. 
[00:57:00]  So, thank you.  You have such a cross-section of demographics.  I swear to God, there's people all walks of life sitting there, and I was sitting between  two of them, but it's my own fault for bringing one of them along with me.  All walks of life.  Idiots and retards.  All walks.  Braid dead.  Braid dead.  And murderers.  Braid dead.  Braid dead in Coma Coast.  What was the highlight for you?  Definitely, I'm looking forward to the next hurricane coming up.  Oh, yeah.  That was very funny.  That was really big. 
[00:57:30]  Jimmy gave a couple little clues to my future, I would say there.  All right.  But the porno thing at the end was great, too.  Cool.  Talking about the black porno guy.  Oh, Lex Steel, yeah, man.  Oh, my God.  I was howling.  My jaw had to relax like a half hour after that show because it was just so tight from  laughing.  Thank you, Angel.  All right, Rob.  Kevin rocked, too.  Yeah, I like Kevin a lot.  Brennan's great, man.  They told us that we couldn't sit in the audience for his half hour.  I was bummed.  I really wanted to be in the crowd for that.  They were just a little nervous because...  I thought it would be cool.  I thought we shouldn't, you know, because the crowd, you know, you don't want to put any attention 
[00:58:00]  on us.  I thought he got a little rowdy, yeah.  Let the comic do his shtick.  Do you know what stupid Patrice said last night?  I go, how can Patrice not come?  Jason said, well, Patrice felt that it was your night.  He didn't want to take attention away from you because he draws so much attention.  I go, that self-centered douchebag.  What was he going to do?  Climb the scurble of the theater with a blonde on his shoulder?  He didn't want to take attention from him. 
[00:58:30]  He didn't look good chained up on that stage, wouldn't he?  Don't take pictures of him.  I talked to Jason and I said, because I was kind of hoping, because Patrice is the one  who relaxed me.  I was so...  And Patrice, I just said the right...  Did he rub your belly and go, come on?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  But I was kind of hoping he would come.  It was all right.  He did.  I'm a comic.  I know how it is.  You're like, yeah, fuck it.  You know, I'll see.  We don't care.  It's what we are.  He had some glass dildos to buy somewhere.  Exactly.  He had to dehumanize some poor immigrant for $3. 
[00:59:00]  Let's go to Joyce in New York.  Joyce?  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Hey, Joyce.  How are you?  Jimmy, I have to tell you, when the light went on and you came on and walked in before  your bald head made an appearance, I jumped up and screamed and everybody else stood up.  It was just a wonderful show.  A night of love.  Thank you.  It really was.  It really was.  It was like you follow a comic from their beginnings.  You see them come on an HBO special and you think, my God, your friend has arrived.  Thank you very much.  It was wonderful.  And you two rock stars walking in there, commanding everybody's detention. 
[00:59:30]  It wasn't our night.  Well, it wasn't.  It was very nice to have the audience respond like that.  You know, we almost didn't get to see Jimmy because when they let us in to see Kevin Brennan,  they told us we couldn't stay for Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  You went to see Kevin and had a solo show.  We stood online two hours prior so we could get in.  And then they handed us a ticket that said 9 o'clock.  So they whipped out my email and said, wait a minute, I'm here to see Jimmy.  Whoever the hell this Kevin guy is, I'm not here to see him. 
[01:00:00]  HBO is a bunch of nervous Nellies, weren't they?  Running around like crazy with their radios and stuff.  We need two seat fillers and this can't happen.  Oh, the 9 o'clock and this.  They were just like running around like crazy people.  Oh, yeah, they were.  There was a blonde Nazi woman.  Yeah, that was her.  Oh, my God.  Up top, she was seating people during Patricia's special and she was yelling like Nurse Ratched.  Sweetheart, you're sitting people, okay?  You're not a player.  She said, I have to look at you before I put you in the seat.  Excuse me?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well, for the up front people, they kind of want some good looking people. 
[01:00:30]  So a bunch of us stayed.  They didn't have much to choose from then.  I'd like two threes and a five, please.  Just a second.  Jesus, is there any fours in this whole damn place?  They're all well-dressed, nice people sitting in the front couple of rows.  Kevin wasn't bad at all.  I mean, I was glad I saw him, but the crowd was not an O&A crowd.  The people that were around us, especially the black woman knitting.  I didn't see her.  There was a black woman knitting?  Right in front of me. 
[01:01:00]  Knitting.  Knitting?  Unbelievable.  That was better than stealing.  Unbelievable.  Better than stealing.  Yeah, so we got the face for Jimmy, of course, and then we moved to even better seats.  Me and Hospitaliano.  So it was great.  Thank you.  It was wonderful, and thanks for a great night, guys.  Thank you, sweetheart.  I very appreciate you coming.  Take care, guys.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Joyce, let's go to John in New York.  I mean, the phones have just exploded.  John?  This is John from Westchester.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, John?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hi, John.  How are you?  Fantastic, man. 
[01:01:30]  Listen, last night was just unbelievable, and it started for me outside on the line.  I mean, I got Stalker Patty, shrilling voice, two people behind me.  I was going to shoot myself or jump in front of a bus, but good thing I didn't, because  I got to see yesterday.  She was there?  Yeah, she was there.  I saw her from the stage.  It's amazing, because the lights are really.  And that's what you need to do, just look at her dead, non-reacting face.  That's a real mood booster.  I didn't get that joke.  Oh, great.  She's a great supporter, but she doesn't know what she's supporting.  She's just there. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, she's one of those people that are supporting something she has no clue about.  She doesn't even know.  She was online trying to be a rock star, but couldn't be.  She just wanted all the attention, and then she just put her head into her shirt, and  was just done.  This show is against everything she believes in.  It really is.  Our sense of humor is nothing like hers.  She is into being nice to people, and nice things, and being charitable.  She doesn't like sex, or bad words. 
[01:02:30]  She gets embarrassed.  Interesting, but she supports this show like a lunatic.  And where's Stubby Fingers?  I'm over here, man.  Seeing you pace outside that line looking for attention last night was the funniest.  I didn't look for it.  First of all, the difference is you were standing on line.  That's one.  Second of all, I just walked in.  But that is kind of funny, because I did walk past the line going, oh, and a stink just  to get their attention.  All right?  You know, you're walking with a hot broad, you know, you want those mutants to look at 
[01:03:00]  you, you know?  And Bonnie was looking good last night.  He certainly was.  She was very funny in the green room, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  She was killing you.  But hey, Rich, how come you left the room right before the set was over?  We went downstairs to the dressing room, right?  No, no, we watched the whole set.  You mean, when he came out, right when he came back out for his standing O and to throw  his kiss?  Because, one, I didn't want to catch hepatitis, and two, we wanted to go down to the dressing  room before, you know.  You know, I just figured you'd stop smiling, you know, black eye in the dark. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, you know what?  You start off with such a good call.  What can you do?  All right.  Go to a message board and kill yourself.  O and A, you guys are rock stars, man.  I was right across from you guys on the lower balcony.  Okay.  I was the first retard to scream in, O and A, party rock!  O and A, party rock!  I heard it from the balcony.  O and A, party rock!  All right, boys, listen, have a great show.  Jimmy, you rock.  I can't wait to see you again.  Thank you, mister.  You know, you're so lucky that, and you were even saying this, that this was taped in New  York.  Can you imagine how horrible that would have been if it was L.A.? 
[01:04:00]  I thought of that, too.  Like, I would love to, the only other places I would have found acceptable, obviously Boston,  Philadelphia, Cleveland would have been, I mean, any of those cities, but New York,  they could have done this in L.A. or another city.  Too cool for the room, people.  Dude.  Don't get it.  Bunch of industry dummies just sitting there, how awful that would have been.  I didn't want industry people there, because they don't laugh, they just sit there and  they suck.  Well, if you have to do that, next time we just rent Greyhound buses and just ship these 
[01:04:30]  psychopaths out there.  Exactly.  Stalker Patty, what's up?  Hey, I want to congratulate Jimmy.  He did a stellar job.  Thank you, Patty.  You are awesome.  A nice little box of Godiva will go your way.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, so good.  You did a stellar performance.  You did such a great job.  That's all I wanted to say.  Patty, Patty, you actually get the jokes and everything?  Yeah, I do.  I laugh and everything.  Sure.  I guess so.  You don't find it maybe a little mean-spirited for your taste?  Yeah, you know, but it's the show. 
[01:05:00]  You know, I laugh.  Hey, I had such a great time yesterday.  I was hanging out with a couple of people afterwards and whatever.  Socializing.  You were socializing?  Yes, I was.  Did anyone finger you?  No, I didn't feel anything.  Oh, wow.  If anybody did, I wouldn't know about it.  And where are you getting all this free chocolate from?  Well, sometimes we have bright looks and then, you know, if it's someone's birthday, I'll buy something for them, you know. 
[01:05:30]  And I get a discount, a really big discount in the store, you know, so it's really awesome.  A lot of my gifts come from the store.  I really.  I got my-  It's 95% of my Christmas shopping.  I got my chocolate hookup on Columbus Avenue.  One of your-  Oh, I know him.  What's his name?  His name is Michael Chocolate or Chocolate Michael.  I have- I've only met him, like, twice in my life.  He never comes in.  I walked in to get some-  The only time I hear from him is this is my chocolate hookup, my manager. 
[01:06:00]  Nah, he's a good guy, man.  He hooks me up.  He's my chocolate connection.  Yeah, I know.  That's cool.  He gives me his 50% discount.  Yeah, that's cool.  Well, family and friends.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  Oh, I'm sitting here looking into my cup of coffee at the Brooklyn Diner.  Oh.  Are you getting recognized at the Brooklyn Diner today?  No.  Oh, do you?  No.  Nope.  You ever get recognized at the Brooklyn Diner?  Not really, no.  Does she have a cell phone now? 
[01:06:30]  She's up to me.  Why?  Call and call it.  Patty, you have a cell phone?  Yeah, I do.  How did you get your whole life together?  She slapped her life together.  Well, you know, things just fall into place.  For the new listeners, I have to tell you, for the new listeners out there, Stalker Patty  was a complete mess.  I mean, you'd think she's a complete mess now, but no, she was a complete and total wreck  a couple of years back.  Just about homeless. 
[01:07:00]  No, it got to a point where she was homeless.  She was living at the radio station.  She had not a possession to her person.  She was living under the stairs with a stuffed rabbit.  Yeah, that's all she had.  On a cum-stained mattress that just happened to be there for some reason.  Under the stairs.  Or a couch or something that was just awful.  And she slapped her life together.  I think the two years that we were off the air, she spent getting her life together because  she wasn't able to obsess about the show.  Now she's got a MiFi, a cell phone, a good-paying job, a job at Kediva. 
[01:07:30]  Very good, Patty.  Very proud of you.  Thank you.  All right, Patty.  Okay, have a great day.  All right, there she goes, stalker Patty.  And the goal of the show, by the way, is to get her to lose all of those.  Oh, of course.  That isn't even a question in my mind.  To have her destitute again.  That is what we want.  Lose her job.  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Jimmy, great show last night.  Oh, thank you, man, very much.  Hey, I come in, and I'm sitting behind six Asian girls. 
[01:08:00]  They were students at the school.  They'd never heard of you before.  So they asked me what kind of comic you were, and I said, well, he's real clean.  You know, he's a great comic.  He's real nice.  As soon as you came out, not ten minutes into your act, you're talking about banging Terry Schiavo.  Good.  Outstanding job, guys.  Great job.  Thank you.  All right.  Did they stay?  All right.  Doughboy from Whack Bag.  Doughboy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  First of all, I just wanted to say that I was sitting in the front row, and that fat beast kicked me out and moved me back to the third row, the front row of actually cushy seats. 
[01:08:30]  You weren't attractive enough?  No, I'm a fat guy in a suit.  It just doesn't work that way.  Wait a minute, sweetie.  What show were you at?  I was at the second show.  Oh, why'd they move you?  Because I'm a fat guy in a suit.  Yeah, but they only moved you to the third row.  That's not bad.  Yeah.  Some people were moved right out of the theater.  They were told to go see a movie.  She's like, yeah, you can go take a seat down front.  It's fine.  No problem. 
[01:09:00]  So I sit down there, and then she walks up.  She's like, I didn't tell you you could sit here.  I just wanted to, like, shit on her.  She was awful.  Yeah, she was scary.  They run a tight ship over there at HBO.  They're amazing.  Tight ship.  But I didn't know that.  I mean, I want messes in the front for my shows.  That's a mess.  It's going to be the attractive people, the model-looking people with the suits.  Yeah.  That way, when they do that camera shot, because I saw the camera behind Jimmy a couple of times,  and they get that shot where you see the comic from the back, and then you can see the audience a little bit.  They want, you know, good-looking people.  Well, I just wanted to congratulate you, sir. 
[01:09:30]  Thanks very much, man.  For sure.  Thank you, buddy.  Adios, man.  All right.  And one more before we break here.  Todd, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to send out a big fat live fuck you to Frank from down in South Jersey.  The motherfucker decided to make a left-hand turn into my truck on the way into the show.  I fucking missed it.  I couldn't get in there.  I had my girlfriend.  She was all pumped, ready to go.  And we sat there and couldn't get in the fucking show because the guy sucks. 
[01:10:00]  Who's a wreck?  Which Frank?  Did you hear that you fucking killed Jimmy?  Just some guy, Frank, I guess.  Oh.  Yeah, he fucking, he sideswiped me.  It was fucking awful.  And it's fantastic hearing everybody say how good the show was.  Wow.  Thank you for letting me turn into your car.  Fuck you, Frank.  You fucking dick.  All right.  Some asshole Frank.  Later, guys.  Bye, fella.  A lot of people want to know what you did after the shows, Jimmy.  Was there a big night?  Well, we've known in the past that Jimmy likes to celebrate in very strange ways when he gets these career moments. 
[01:10:30]  The last career moment he had was finally getting to talk to Ozzy Osbourne on this show.  It was like a 40-minute interview that just, quite frankly, was some of the best radio we've ever done.  And we were all on a high.  And you celebrated by, I think, if I'm not mistaken, maybe someone could help us out because the fans know the show better than we do.  But I think you got a young lady of the evening and she did something on your chest or something, right?  I don't remember, but I'm sure one of the listeners will.  It's very, very likely that I did something awful.  So you were, you know, you had this unbelievable high and then you decided that this is what you needed to do to celebrate. 
[01:11:00]  So, you know, a lot of us wondering, well, this was this big moment on HBO.  Yeah, how did you screw this up?  Yeah.  We were off the air when I did the Westbury Music Fair.  I did a great show there and I picked up a prostitute that night.  And her boyfriend was chasing her down the street and he's beating on my car windows.  It was awful.  He's like, get out of the car, bitch!  She jumps in.  She's like, help me, help me!  And she jumps in my car.  And that was what I did after Westbury Music Fair.  There's always some type of misbehavior. 
[01:11:30]  But last night, I went to the comedy cellar and just had an apple pie with a little ice cream.  What a faggot I'm turning into.  But he made me take the ice cream and drop it on his stomach.  Chocolate of course.  They gave me a room at the Soho Grand and I was going to stay.  But I wanted to just go home and get up and do the show.  Oh, you didn't stay in the room?  Only because I had to come in today.  And what were I going to do?  Just lay there with no computer and realize I'm in my hometown.  I have nothing to do.  That's true.  It would have been depressing.  So no, I got nothing.  It was cool to go out.  He wanted to go home right after the tape. 
[01:12:00]  And I'm like, are you crazy?  Just go hang out.  You got to ride out that high that I'm sure you had.  Yeah, we did.  We went to the cellar and that was where I would want to be anyway.  And we were all laughing at you in the green room because he was comparing the HBO thing  to the time he was on The Tonight Show.  Everyone in the room can relate to something like that.  And what was it?  The lighting or the crowd or something?  I really am an ass.  Because you were talking about the applause.  Right.  It was in between shows.  They just clapped a lot.  And Patrice told me that was going to happen.  He was like, just let it happen.  Enjoy it.  And I'm like, yeah, I know.  I'm like, I kind of had that. 
[01:12:30]  I'm like, they do that on The Tonight Show a lot.  They'll just kind of clap after the bits.  Like, he's in a room with like, you know, 10 guys that did, you know, some time on The  Tonight Show.  We're all just like, uh.  Yeah, we can relate to that, Jimmy.  You said it so casual.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  You're not used to having your jokes clapped after.  It's just a very odd, you know, nice thing.  But you just kind of.  I can tell you that.  It definitely worked, though.  Let's get another lady on the line here.  Stacey in Jersey.  Stacey.  Ooh, lady.  Hey, Stacey. 
[01:13:00]  I just wanted to congratulate Jimmy on a great show.  Last night.  Ooh, thank you.  Why can't you speak?  Why do you have to speak so quietly?  All the girls are talking very softly today.  Yeah.  Maybe I don't want to be attacked.  I just wanted to say great show.  Oh, thank you.  You're welcome.  We're in a good mood today.  I don't think so.  Yeah, you sound it.  We're not going to be attacking today, I don't think.  Tomorrow we attack that.  All right, then I'll call tomorrow.  All right, thanks, Stacey.  Bye, miss.  Bye.  Bye.  We have time to play with Nathaniel.  She was a little confrontational.  She certainly was.  I didn't like Stacey just then.  She was nervous, Anthony.  She had to know.  She was talking low. 
[01:13:30]  I said, why are you talking low?  She's like, well, I don't want to be attacked.  I said, no, you're not going to be attacked.  I didn't like that call.  She was very nervous.  She was nervous we were going to just, yeah, jump down her throat.  Definitely.  Oh, the fan pictures of Pat from Unaki are showing up.  Here's one.  He's got like a look that he puts on in all the pictures now.  There's some guy, I guess, taking a picture with Pat, and he's very excited about it.  And Pat's doing a thumbs up and making a, hey, ha-ha, kind of face.  That's Pat to what it looks like, Stinky from Aberdeen Costello. 
[01:14:00]  Right there.  You haven't met Pat from Unaki yet?  I probably met him.  I don't know.  Yeah, he's a star now.  My character, is he?  Yeah, he's a star.  All right, we got the Nathaniel voicemail.  What's this all about?  It wasn't a big deal.  It was just that I'm just so nervous about HBO, and I get the interns calling me, trying  to get the VIP treatment, wanting the tickets, just wanting to cut the line, and it's just  like...  Now, I would think, I would think, if Nathaniel wanted something done about getting, not having 
[01:14:30]  to wait on the line for the HBO thing for Jimmy, he would probably go through Eric.  Eric and say, look, is there a way I could get there?  But he figured he's a go-getter.  He's going right to the source, regardless of the fact that Jimmy's probably thinking  about the HBO special every, I don't know, tenth of a second or so, and has nothing else  on his mind.  He took two days off from this program to get his mind in order and set for this HBO thing. 
[01:15:00]  But Nathaniel assumed he should call Jimmy and ask him to get him on the line, get him  so he could skip the line and get right in, and Jimmy, you'll get right to work on that.  Can I meekly defend myself now or after we play the audio?  I think after, right?  Yeah, I think we need to hear the audio.  All right, here it is.  Hey, Jim, it's Nathaniel.  Just coming up with my email.  Well, I'm just hoping to get into your show tomorrow. 
[01:15:30]  Danny and I both have tickets.  We got them through Broadway video.  If there's any way we can get in without waiting in line, that would be awesome.  If you could, give me a call back.  I'd appreciate it.  Talk to you later, Jim.  Jimmy's just, well, drop everything.  Drop everything.  HB what?  I don't even, in my defense, I hadn't gotten a satisfactory answer from Eric in terms of  being able to, you know, because the line went around the block, and I knew it was going 
[01:16:00]  to be very hard to sort of get in, and I would like to see Jimmy up close and personal, because  I enjoy his comedy.  And I had, so I emailed Jim, and I was just going to leave it at that.  I knew he was busy, so if he's going to get to it, he didn't.  And I, under the recommendation.  I like the little bastard Eric there.  You let everybody know that you did indeed ask Eric, and did not get a satisfactory answer.  Well, from there, I called Kenny, who was handling all this stuff. 
[01:16:30]  And Kenny was saying, oh, I'll see what I can do.  And Kenny had a million other things, and I never heard back, so I said, I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  So he took it upon himself.  So I was a little nervous, and Ben did recommend to call Jim personally.  Ben, you're the one that told DeFaniel to call.  Well, listen, I told him just to call him.  I didn't think Jim would care.  But people don't understand.  Jim doesn't give a shit about this stuff.  But it's just me.  Well, listen, this was a different thing.  Hold on, hold on.  I've got to get into this.  What people don't understand, you're looking at the biggest instigator on the show. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, I know.  A lot of people point their finger at me.  He's the biggest instigator on this program.  He loves stirring it up and then stepping back and looking.  He does it all the time and just sits back and giggles.  Well, no, wait a second.  Well, this was a different thing.  Kenny was being like, oh, this is HBO's thing.  I mean, look, I didn't even, none of us had backstage passes or anything last night.  It was a whole thing.  I even asked Kenny, are we going to have seats reserved?  Oh, I don't know.  That was yesterday.  So how this whole thing went, we had no control of it.  So I told him just to call Jim.  I didn't think Jim would care. 
[01:17:30]  How did it work out for you, Nathaniel?  Did you actually get in?  Yeah, it was a little harder than it was for Danny.  I'm not trying to throw him under the bus either.  He was a little more forward and got in, and I was a little more meek, and it took me a little longer time.  I love the competition between these two guys.  Did Danny give you like a ha-ha before he walked in or something?  He did until I then walked by him on the way to seating.  I don't know.  It just worked out that I went right by him.  See, I've got to explain another thing.  You've got to get everyone involved here. 
[01:18:00]  There's a hierarchy going on here, okay?  We hired Derek.  Derek does a great job taking us in and out of breaks and coming up with music on the fly when we need it for bits and stuff.  Derek's like the boss in that room.  Yeah.  Well, let's not go nuts.  And honestly, he's like this much higher than Danny and Nathaniel, just barely.  Barely.  If you're looking at an official hierarchy of the behind-the-scenes crew,  and then Danny and Nathaniel are basically waiting in the wings to take Derek's job.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  So when Derek screws up, and he will, everyone does.  Because everyone does.  And then we're going to have to move one of these guys up.  So these guys are jockeying position always.  That would be a real tough decision.  If you had to make it today, who do you put there?  Derek leaves.  Something happens.  He's gone.  Who now moves up?  Because the other guy is just going to continue doing what he's been doing.  But one of them will get that little notch up.  I think I like Danny.  Oh, wow.  That's so sarcastic for me.  What? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  I forgot how unwelcome sarcasm was at this show.  Hence the joke, buddy.  I don't know.  That would be a tough one.  I think we would have to do it because they're pretty equal here.  I think we'd have to do it on some kind of lottery basis.  Coin toss.  Some way where fate is the only one to blame.  Because there's a rumor that's already circulating that we might have to fire Derek because he  was, you know, feeling up Sunset Thomas and fingering her on company. 
[01:19:30]  Feeling up is brushing your hand over a breast.  That was sex that was going on on that couch.  And he was doing it on company time.  So he's got a meeting with human resources later today.  Very upset.  You know what would be beautiful?  If he left and instead of putting Danny in a fan, he just brought in someone from the  outside.  Oh, really?  Don't screw him over.  Stalker Patty.  Put Ricky in there.  Yeah.  Ricky.  Well, no.  You know that Travis kid.  He's a go-getter.  Travis is really a go-getter.  I don't know. 
[01:20:00]  But like you were saying yesterday, I think he's brown-nosing it a little bit.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Like these guys, they've built their reputations here on their hard work and, you know, a sense  of humor and fitting in with the show.  And I'm not saying Travis hasn't, but Travis is adding this element of, I'll do whatever  you want.  Can I wash your apple, sir?  Yeah, things like that.  Like it's a good thing.  I mean, to see the guy wash the apple is something I don't think Nathaniel or Danny would  do.  And we're going to talk about brown-nosing. 
[01:20:30]  You know, Anthony and I don't like brown-nosers.  Jimmy, you like brown-nosers?  If they're brown-nosing me, yes.  If they're brown-nosing other people, no.  Yeah, watching a brown-nose someone else is like, that stinks.  That's revolting.  Brown-nosing me?  You're a go-getter.  And I'm starting to think that Danny slept here last night, so we would notice when we  came in how hard of a worker he is.  No.  All of a sudden, he's waking up, conveniently, he's waking up on the couch as I'm walking in.  No, I don't see that at all.  I see a drunk kid that had to fucking sleep it off in the workplace. 
[01:21:00]  Very irresponsible.  All right, well.  So you took care of him, Nathaniel?  Well, amazing.  How did that work out?  You didn't even call back.  By hitting a save just long enough to get Steve to get that audio.  He didn't do anything.  That's pretty much what he did.  And I didn't expect him to.  And I wasn't, you know, thinking Jim's going to be shaking my hand as I walk into the Scribble  Theater last night.  I talked to the HBO people.  I actually went to, called L.A., and I talked to Chris Albrecht, and I said, look, this kid 
[01:21:30]  has to get in first.  And they made a few phone calls, and there was a problem with the line, but everything got,  apparently a couple people were fired, but hopefully they got all straight.  I'll be taping my own special at the end of the month.  Jim did great.  Yeah.  Good one.  Wonderful.  Give me a car crash.  That sucked.  There we go.  All right, Nathaniel.  Thank you.  Good job.  Okay.  We'll take a break.  You got him?  No?  Nothing.  Nothing.  It's good.  It applies to you.  We still got lots to do.  We got Voss in studio.  Yep.  He was cracking us up in the green room, talking about his little vacation to Atlanta. 
[01:22:00]  So we got to get into that a little bit.  Also, Sandy Cain, the return of Sandy Cain today.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Sandy Cain returns.  And her genital wart.  So we're all going to have to take a look at that to see how much it's grown in the last  two years, two and a half years.  Oh, I hate that I have something in common with her.  You've got a wart on your finger, right?  Uh-huh.  They were taken off.  I had them taken off.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Those are just warts.  You've got to see what she's got.  It's like an ear growing.  Yeah, it's really disgusting. 
[01:22:30]  It looks like cauliflower, and it's kind of bubbling skin.  It's growing off of her pubis.  Just off.  In like a tube.  It first comes out of her, which looks like this fleshy tube.  And then at the end of the tube is this lump of cauliflower-like flesh that kind of goes  back and forth if she flicks it.  Can you get my wart into the show? 
[01:23:00]  That's awful.  We nicknamed it.  It's Twato.  Yeah, because Quato from the, what the hell's the name of the movie?  Total Recall.  Total Recall.  Yeah, they've got Quato, that little beast that comes out of the guy's gut.  Well, this is Twato.  A little beast hanging from her twat.  So she's coming in.  And also, I think when we get back, we've got to get into the Ricky situation.  Another intern here.  You want to talk about the hierarchy.  Oh, he is low man on the scrotum, Paul, man.  Oh, my God.  And then they shaved him or something?  They shaved his awful mustache last night.  How degrading is it to have other men shave you? 
[01:23:30]  See, we're showing our age, Anthony, because, you know, as soon as it was over, we got out of there.  You know, you went back to the hotel, and I went back to my apartment, just crashed hard.  These guys were just beginning their night.  Is it age, or is it the fact that I had to get up for work the next day?  Yeah, but these guys had to, too.  They slept here.  They barely slept.  But Danny said he got back here at, like, 3 in the morning.  They all got really drunk, and they shaved Ricky's awful mustache, and Ricky's, like, sort of kissing girls. 
[01:24:00]  And I'm hearing rumors he might get kicked out of his house.  Were they in a bar?  Did they go to a bar?  Yeah, they went to some kind of lounge down there in the village.  Yeah.  And Ricky's got his report on sarcasm today as well.  We've got lots of radio to do.  You got that?  All right, we'll go to break with this.  Check this out.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars, where mutants drive plastic cars. 
[01:24:30]  So I go there.  You know the rest.  The best part is the girl with three breasts.  Turtle re-  Dillon. 
[01:25:00]  Recalling.  Turtle re-  So I'm on Mars, and I meet Queto, and I pull this big metallic thing out of my nose. 
[01:25:30]  It makes me scream, and it makes me scream, and shout, and move my big robotic head all about.  Turtle re-  Recalling.  Recalling.  See you at the party, Victor.  Turtle re-  Recalling.  Turtle re-  Recalling.  Recalling.  Recalling. 
[01:26:00]  Recalling.  Recalling.  Recalling.  Turtle re-  One more time, fellas.  Turtle re-  Recalling.  I'm going to start ballin'.  I'm so sad.  I can't screw Sharon Stone and McCallie Culkin.  He's left home all alone.  Toto re-  Recalling.  Toto re- 
[01:26:30]  Recalling.  Jeremy, give me the best.  You're not- You've got to slap it a little harder.  It's a little harder.  Give me the best.  All right.  Okay.  Boobs always bring this show to a hall.  Oh, it's greasing hall.  I am playing.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is beautiful.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:27:00]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Tell me some good names.  Those are real.  Wow, that's cool.  How about the woman just took the shirt off?  Ah, yeah.  Sexy girls.  Sex, sexy girls.  You have sorry.  Wow.  Girls show boobs.  Boobs.  I see boobs.  Boobs.  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  Hey.  It was amazing.  That's nice.  Both be an Anthony.  Hey.  Yeah.  It's world renowned.  It's Whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:27:30]  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Can't see your report.  Oh, shit.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Huh?  Show us your findings.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  XM2 Hotel.  The OPN Anthony Show.  All right. 
[01:28:00]  Let's set the scene, man.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Rich Vos in studio. 
[01:28:30]  Jim Norton, of course.  We're just glowing in the whole evening that we enjoyed with Jim Norton last night as he  taped his HBO special.  We're going to get Ricky the intern in here to do his report on sarcasm.  And we'll comment about his new look, I guess.  Yep.  Courtesy of the fans that decided to shave him.  Yeah.  At like three in the morning at some freaking lounge in the middle of the village.  Right.  And Sandy Kane is here.  Oh.  Well, should we bring her in?  Well, she's getting through security and the paperwork. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, so you're going to wait.  You're going to let her wait out there.  That was just a thing, Nopi.  Rich, I want to thank you for being here just in case I forget.  I can't believe I got right in, either.  Yeah, really.  It was unbelievable.  No, Rich knows what to do now.  Rich doesn't mess around.  Rich just walks in the door and sits down now.  He's like, I ain't fucking waiting.  He's like, he knows if he sits on the couch of doom over there, you're just stuck watching  the show.  I'm going to sit out there like a fucking fat girl. 
[01:29:30]  Hi, someone asked me to dance.  Please.  The fact that I got up this morning.  Look at this mess.  Oh, Jesus.  He's ready to get naked.  Cute little pink fuzzy jacket.  Look at that.  Jesus Christ.  She's got a belly shirt on.  Yeah.  She just took off her pink fur, I guess.  She looks like an old dancer.  Her name should be like Dusty Vagina.  You're getting props on the phone lines today, Voss. 
[01:30:00]  James, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I got to tell you.  Whenever you have Voss with you three, it's like, it's perfect.  You could be talking about dirt, and it would be funny.  I mean, Jimmy and him are like brothers.  You guys sound awesome.  Yeah.  We love when the rich comes in.  It's just a bunch of friends getting together.  You know, Rich, in case something happens at the end of the show, thanks for coming in.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You're right.  And we just did that.  Here's the thing about these HBO specials. 
[01:30:30]  You know, the two people, you know, comics, you know, you kind of get a little jealous because you're not.  But the two people that you love that you're fucking are both doing one, it's almost just as good.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, because Voss's fiance, Bonnie, did one as well.  Friday night.  Friday night.  She got a standing O.  And, you know, for two months, I was, you know, I mean, we've been on the road forever, you know, and she wasn't a road comic.  She was an L.A. comic, and I'm a road comic, so I kind of had to help her along, you know.  And then she got this special.  They asked for a tape from her. 
[01:31:00]  She didn't have the tape, so I booked two nights for us.  Listen, I'm not taking credit.  I'm just saying how will you help as a couple.  Oh, boy.  No, as you help as a couple.  There we go.  But listen, no.  This tape right here that you're hearing, folks, will end up in litigation.  Oh, I've got to tell you what she said.  This will be a tape that will be played in courtroom.  Oh, boy.  Wait, wait, let me tell you.  Jimmy's giving you a look like, just shut up now.  But, no, when you're a couple and you're doing shows, she has good shows around.  She's not a comic like us.  But when we were at the Stress Factory, I mean, she doesn't do well there. 
[01:31:30]  It's not her club.  They're animals, you know.  You've got to follow that phone call and fucking Vinny's hack fest.  So, you know, all we do is fight.  But she came a long way, right?  When I came off your show last time, you guys were talking about prenups.  Remember you were talking about prenups?  Yep.  I swear to God, driving home that day in a car, she brought it up.  You know, she thinks, well, I've got an HBO special now.  Maybe I should get a prenup.  Oh, that she should get a prenup.  I didn't even bring it up.  Yeah, and she goes, and then I'm arguing with her against it.  I'm going, wait a second.  What am I?  I'm an idiot.  Well, I was doing psychology. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  And so it was perfect.  Psychology.  But as I'm saying, it's tough when you're, what am I going with this?  Nowhere.  It's just great to watch because you're just digging this hole going, she's a great, she's  a good comic.  I mean, look, I helped her along.  No, no.  We help each other.  You're just waiting for one of us to help you out.  No, what I was saying is when you're two, when you're a best friend and you're a girl.  Are you going to sign a prenup?  Fuck yeah.  I just, look at this watch.  You think I'm going to let her take that?  That is nice, man.  I'm trying, I'm trying to get the necklace and the ring back and still get married. 
[01:32:30]  It's a nice ring.  She trashed me in the dressing room last night.  You know, this, we got to be fair on this show.  I mean, we kill each other on a daily basis.  But, you know, you got to get props as well.  I was up late.  It was a school night.  And I remember that you were telling me you were going to be on Dennis Miller.  I'm like, oh yeah, that's right.  And I've been starting to take a peek at Dennis Miller.  That show's not that bad at all.  I'm starting to enjoy it.  And you were on Dennis Miller.  Yeah.  Let's get right to the thing. 
[01:33:00]  And he doesn't have you come out and do your act in front of the crowd or his studio audience.  He sits down with you.  So you're sitting right next to Dennis Miller doing your act pretty much for him.  You know, one guy, basically.  You're focusing on him.  And he was just enjoying the hell out of you, man.  You could tell when these TV guys are politely helping out the comics.  But he was really, really enjoying it.  And I was really happy for you, man.  I was like, holy crap, Voss is killing in front of Dennis Miller.  Well, thank you. 
[01:33:30]  The thing is, when you're doing...  Wait, you did Dennis Miller?  Huh?  I didn't know you did Dennis Miller.  Listen, don't.  No, no.  It's like he just did HBO.  Dennis Miller.  That's like, that's like, that's like, you know, it's like serving him filet mignon and throwing Scrapple in my face.  That's a great, that's nice.  Isn't it?  Well, because we were talking about like, okay, let me tell you something.  Shut up, Jizz comic.  Okay.  Wait, was that CNBC?  No, actually, he's fuckface.  Okay.  I was, I was, you know, you got to do a lot of stuff when you're waiting for your own TV show to get started. 
[01:34:00]  You know, so you're doing a little stuff to keep your face out.  Oh, you fucking...  I'm happy for you.  Oh, wow.  Oh, look at this douchebag during a special.  And me and Colin Quinn, he's name dropping during his own special.  I'll explain why, I'll explain why I mentioned Colin's name.  Because the joke, there was one line in the joke where I said, I, I, something about us being men.  And I had never made it clear.  And it only worked well when I mentioned me and Colin, a male's name. 
[01:34:30]  That's the only reason I did that.  Well, the thing about Dennis Miller, I mean, it's just, it's a small show.  He's a great guy.  But at the end, when I was done and I threw a kiss to the audience, Dennis said, you can always come back now.  Okay.  Foster, you missed that whole discussion where you started the show kind of talking about that.  Oh, no.  And you, you got me off the hook.  Because you told me right after, you know, the taping, don't forget that he blew kisses to the audience.  So, I, I felt a, a, a relief.  Because when Jim acknowledged Ant and I on, you know, in the audience and made us stand up, 
[01:35:00]  which is such, such an awkward moment, I actually gave him a thumbs up.  I looked at him, I looked at him and I didn't know what to do.  So, I go, I just go like this, thumbs up to Jimmy, right?  And I'm like, oh, did I just give a thumbs up?  And then Anthony admitted that his thumb was on the way up.  I was almost gonna, but then I decided to give him the point, like, you know, it's about you.  So, I thought I was gonna get killed because I knew someone, I knew someone saw that and was gonna throw me under the bus.  Oh, he gave the thumbs up that should have been the freeze frame that do at the end of Chips episode. 
[01:35:30]  I was like, oh, did I just give a thumbs up?  I'm like, oh, that was horrible.  It really was bad.  But you saved me by real, because I didn't notice that he did the kiss thing.  I'm like, all right, this, all right, this will bounce it out slightly, you know?  Oh, geez.  Everybody throw a kiss.  Oh, dude.  All three of you on stage.  It's just weird when there's such a special happy moment for one of your friends. 
[01:36:00]  There was such gay crap going on on the stage, in the audience, backstage in between shows.  Jimmy's hugging and kissing Anthony and I and saying he loves us.  And I'm just like, this is just awful.  When he threw a kiss, Milton Berle died again.  It was horrible.  I guess you don't know what to do, like, when you're in those, you know, you just, you know, 
[01:36:30]  when he said...  It's awkward to be, like, loving.  When you get to be in craves, it's awkward to be, like, sweet.  You know what I mean?  To be genuine.  All kidding aside, you know, obviously, it felt good, you know, the hugs and the kisses.  You know, when he goes to two guys that I, you know, I like to thank...  No, it was awesome.  I like to thank the two guys I love, Opie and Anthony.  You know, in the back of his mind, he's saying the two stepping stone.  You know, shut up.  Fucking...  So, listen.  Listen.  Here we go.  He would have said hi to you from the stage where he needed a bullhorn so he could hear it 
[01:37:00]  from the seat you were at.  Yeah, but I wanted to step to him so he looked thin.  Yeah, just, you know, if we could actually rewind a year or so, and Jimmy was doing the  same special.  I'd like to thank Colin Quinn.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we're going to find five years ago.  I'd like to thank Andrew Dyson.  Whoever it is.  You should have just edited that part out just in case something happens before it airs  where you can just pop in whoever.  I'd like to thank Bob Levy. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, by the way, Anthony and I want to get in on this a little bit.  Jimmy filmed his HBO special last night.  Voss just did Dennis Miller.  And Anthony and I are featured in Penthouse this month.  You just spit all over the place.  I love that.  I do that all the time.  I knew it was going to sound absolutely awful.  First of all, isn't it Hustler?  Oh, I said Penthouse?  Yeah.  Oh, we did it.  And then you spit all over the floor. 
[01:38:00]  Well, we do have an interview coming out in Penthouse as well.  Oh, we do?  Ah, they love us.  The Smut magazines love you and I.  The Smut magazines just adore this program.  No, it's Hustler magazine.  I'm sorry.  The July issue.  We have a little mention on the cover, too.  You can't spit if you say Hustler, though.  You know...  And Tiles.  Hustler.  Hustler.  Hustler.  Hustler.  We're in Hustler magazine.  But where were we at?  Oh, so you were talking about your time at Atlantis.  Oh, at Atlantis.  And that's where I went on vacation.  It's not the Atlantis. 
[01:38:30]  Yes, it is.  What it is.  It's just called Atlantis.  The Atlantis.  Well, what do you say?  Atlantis?  I went to Atlantis?  Yeah.  I went to Atlantis.  Well, the Atlantis.  You know, I took my kids power sailing, right?  I said that last night.  I remember.  Yeah, last night.  I was like, yeah, the kids went power sailing.  You kidding me?  When we were in the green room, I'm like, I'm just trying to be your friend, and I'm smiling  and stuff, and I whisper to Eric, Eric, write all this down for the show tomorrow.  But it says they went power sailing, and he keeps the story going.  No one said anything, because we're amazed thinking, did he say power sailing? 
[01:39:00]  And then you're trying to realize what power sailing is, and I'm thinking, power sailing?  Isn't that just called motorboating?  It's power sailing.  Wait, can I back up?  And then we realize, oh my God, he means parasailing.  Everyone missed the obvious line, so we've got to let Chandler in here.  Chandler.  Yeah, hey, good.  How are you doing this morning, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Gamora, congratulations there, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, I heard that Voss gave a thumbs up, too, but nobody could see his little midget fingers 
[01:39:30]  from all the way to the back of the room.  Touching out, guys.  There you go.  The Atlantis is probably the most expensive.  Here's the thing.  It's unbelievable how much this crap costs there.  Like, and one, you're on the beach, they're selling everything.  I did all my Christmas shopping there.  Black people are selling coconuts.  That's great.  It's setting a race back another 200 years, but there's no...  Did you take the walk down the beach?  The walk... 
[01:40:00]  To the public beach?  No.  There's a public...  Where are you?  Oh my God.  Why?  They're trying to sell you everything on the way, right?  It was...  No, when you're not used to seeing...  How am I going to say this without sounding like a complete tool?  When you're not used to seeing a lot of black people in one place at one time just enjoying  themselves, it is just a weird, weird feeling you got, man.  Yeah, when they're not waiting in line to cash a check or something?  Well, it's a known fact in the Bahamas.  I mean, they obviously have a really good government because it's all locals working the tourist 
[01:40:30]  industry.  You go to other islands and they're importing college kids in from all over the world, but  something with the Bahamas is, no, only hire the locals.  That is it.  And these guys, when they're, you know, they get their day off, I think it's a Monday because  I walked down the beach and I was just, holy crap.  Well, the thing is, too, and there's really no crime there because their whole island's  based on tourism.  Right, yeah.  So, and if they have all those people working, they're not going to let crime happen in  front of them.  Of course not. 
[01:41:00]  And they bust their ass.  I mean, the guy's walking around with a box of coconuts and drinks on his head.  Ed, Ed, if you ever go to Atlantis, go see Ed.  See Atlantis.  I want to take the kids to the Disney World after this.  Go see Ed.  Because Ed saw me coming.  Yeah.  I'm laying out and I decide to get two coconut drinks with some fine rum.  Yeah.  And I'm like, how much?  He goes, $30.  And I only had $20 on me and the guilt hits me immediately. 
[01:41:30]  I'm like, is there an ATM machine around here?  I'll get the other $10.  Oh, I thought you were looking for Ben.  He goes, no, $20 is okay.  Yeah.  Fast forward, end of the week, I'm getting the same damn drinks for like $5 a piece.  That's what they are.  Yeah.  I took, like, when I wake up in the morning, I have to have coffee in my room.  I want a coffee pot.  Right?  You know, and I'm so far away from, you know, walking to your coffee.  Jimmy, listen to this one.  And you've got to have coffee.  Right?  Now, I want it right then.  And then if you want a roof service, it takes 40 minutes. 
[01:42:00]  And it's like, you know, after tipping, it's like $17 for coffee in the morning, you know?  So I figured I need to make coffee.  And it hit me.  Like, in the club, they had instant coffee.  And they had powder milk.  So I took the instant coffee and the powder milk back to my room.  And I take on the road my little steamer to steam my suit.  And if you put water in there, the steamer boils to steam.  So I boiled the water in my steamer. 
[01:42:30]  And I made instant coffee every morning.  Okay?  I felt like I was in Oz.  Okay?  The kids wanted pancakes.  So I had them cook that on.  Well, whatever.  I don't have a punchline for that.  Did you get iron and make grilled cheese?  Oh, man.  How soon the flow ends.  That really deserves a good car crash.  And then you go to the buffet.  It's like 40.  You really make coffee with your steamer, though.  You're a big star now.  Can you believe it?  Yeah, but I don't like to wait for my coffee.  You go downstairs.  It was only two bucks a cup or something. 
[01:43:00]  It's not that I've stayed in the villa.  You know how far a walk everything is at the Atlantis?  You know, I just want my coffee.  And it's just kind of cool that you can make it in the steamer.  You can improvise.  It's Atlantis with a T, by the way.  And then the buffet is like 40 a person.  Atlantis Morissette.  I was at Atlantis Morissette.  The Atlantis.  The Atlantis.  The buffet is like 40 a person.  You know, if you're under 11, it's cheaper.  So I said my one kid's under 11.  Oh, she's pretty tall.  Yeah, she's a mutant.  So then I wouldn't pay for the buffet. 
[01:43:30]  I said, well, it's only two.  And I would have them make me little sandwiches and hand them to me under the table.  This is the high living that Rich Voss has done at the Atlantis.  He finally makes it and he's still living this way.  Coffee out of a steamer and hand me that under the table.  Yeah, I had to make a little crab salad sandwiches.  And I said, can my kids take their dessert to go from the buffet?  And I got some pies, brought it back to my room.  It was a big party there at the Atlantis.  Believe you me.  Okay. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, do they bug you when you're walking down the beach?  Is it like it is in Rio where they kind of attack you to sell you stuff?  Or are they like kind of cool?  Well, they walk by and they'll go, you know, do you want a necklace?  If you go yes or no, they sell a lot of cigars.  I brought like 15 Cubans back that really aren't, you know.  Yeah, they don't bug you, but they just walk by making a living.  When you're laying down, maybe trying to sleep on the beach, you hear them always coming by.  Like, braids?  You want to buy a bag or something?  I'm trying to sleep. 
[01:44:30]  Shut up.  It costs like 200 bucks to get my kids' hair braided, you know, with the beads.  That's a big business.  They got the bead thing done?  Oh, they make a fortune, yeah.  And then they come back up here and look ridiculous.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Bo Derek, that was 40 years ago and the kids are still doing it.  But they make a fortune.  Yeah.  Hey, we haven't had one of these in a while.  We'll humor this guy.  Benny in Texas.  What's up, Benny?  Oh, here we go.  You guys suck.  You guys blow.  It's just a rip-off of the Hollister show done in a bad way.  You guys aren't funny. 
[01:45:00]  That's why they took your ass off Premium Channel because nobody wanted to buy your ass.  My rates went up another dollar to pay for your sorry ass.  You guys suck.  Are you talking so fast so we can't interrupt you?  Why don't you just slow down and talk one sentence at a time?  I'm done.  That's it?  But why are you listening if it sucks?  Yeah, Benny, that's what destroys your whole argument.  Hold on, Benny.  Hold on, Benny.  No, it destroys your whole argument.  There's about 200 channels on XM.  So why are you listening to us, then?  I'll tell you why.  Because I wanted to know what it was all about, and you guys suck. 
[01:45:30]  I wanted to give you guys a chance, but you guys blow.  Yeah, it was very obvious that we sucked last night when we were at the HBO taping.  Nothing but love in the room.  Well, good for you.  Anything else, Benny?  No.  Who's your favorite comic?  Do you realize that, you know, we were going to just leave him alone, but do you realize  that Howard Stern's ratings are just nosediving here in New York and nosediving all over the  country?  Well, that's fine.  That's fine.  He gives a better show.  What else do you like from 1986, sir?  He used to do a pretty good show.  I'll give him the props, definitely.  But he's been calling it in for years. 
[01:46:00]  So for you to say that is just, you know, is dishonest.  The guy's ratings came out here in New York.  We haven't even really talked about it.  It took a nosedive.  He's going nowhere.  Do you realize when he goes to satellite radio that this show is going to have a much  bigger audience right off the bat?  I'm sure it will.  I'm sure it will.  But hey, you guys just ain't funny.  Now, come on.  Well, then the thing goes somewhere else.  You're obviously listening.  That's what amazes me.  When I don't like something, first of all, I stop listening.  And second of all, I don't go out of my way to call the host of the show. 
[01:46:30]  Benny, you'll keep listening.  How do I know if I'm not going to like it?  You know, if I don't give you a chance.  I'm giving you a chance.  All right, listen.  And you'll keep listening, sir.  All right, listen.  You gave us a chance.  You hate it.  So move on.  That's how it works.  Well, how long do you have it?  And you know what?  And if enough people hate the show and don't like it and move on, guess what?  It'll take care of itself.  We will not be on the XM platform.  That's how it works, Benny.  Exactly.  But guess what?  Guess what?  We're going to be here for a while.  You'll keep listening, Benny.  Benny, how long have you listened?  Just for today?  No, actually, I've listened for a week. 
[01:47:00]  For a week.  So you actually spent a week listening to something you didn't like?  Dude, you're an idiot.  No, I did not.  I spent the week trying to get to know the show.  No, dude, I listen.  I don't know what decision-making process you go through, but I'll listen to something  for like five or six minutes, and I can pretty much tell if it's my vibe.  Are you that stupid that you would spend a week?  Sometimes there's just something during the part of the show that sucks.  But maybe something else along the way might be funny.  But you guys aren't funny.  What's the point?  Dude, the bottom line is this. 
[01:47:30]  Dude, you spent a week listening.  You are a dumb motherfucker.  I am paying for XM satellites.  Dude, I don't care.  I know you don't care.  What you pay for.  Benny.  You have a medial job.  Keep spending your hard-earned money on us.  You're paying for us.  Benny, you're not paying for the actual Opie and Anthony show.  You're paying for the whole XM platform.  So if you don't like this channel, then there's a million other ones to choose from.  Absolutely.  That's how it works.  A million now they got.  You know, you don't have to try to, you know, say that you're paying just for us. 
[01:48:00]  You know that's not true.  And also, Benny, I don't know if I want you to let me in, but my DVD is funny that you  can get on richfoss.com.  Why don't you give that a chance?  That's right.  Give it a plug.  Okay.  Let me, Benny.  Hey, look, I got to get to work.  I appreciate you guys giving my call.  Appreciate it.  Well, let me ask you a question, though.  How does it feel to have voiced your opinion and to understand that nobody in this room  cares about you at all?  I feel better.  I do.  I'm not even trying to bust your balls.  If you, nobody in this room, your opinion is absolute, you work your whole life and you 
[01:48:30]  sweat and you put your money in the bank and we don't care if you die on the way  to work this morning.  Okay.  All right.  Well, you have a good afternoon.  Keep listening, stupid.  And you will.  I just love calls like him because, you know, they're just running out of steam to, you know,  defend Howard and try to talk about his show.  Like, people aren't as passionate about Howard's show anymore.  Howard had a little boost when the whole FCC thing happened and when he said he was going  to satellite.  You know, people tuned in to see what was going on.  But that quickly just dissolved again. 
[01:49:00]  The latest ratings came out.  He's in the toilet.  He's being beaten by, you know, Spanish language stations and it's just...  And that's in his hometown.  I mean, that magic just is not there anymore.  It's just not there.  That's in his hometown.  He's in some markets, you know, this is stuff he doesn't like to talk about.  Not even some.  A lot of markets.  He's out of the top 10, out of the top 20.  It's not the days of old where this guy could go out and, you know, pack stadiums and go  to book signings where they're wrapped around the block 800 times. 
[01:49:30]  It just...  That's the past.  And people, for some reason, still think that's going on.  They got this fan mentality that they absolutely believe.  That's the point I want to make, though.  Not as many as there used to be.  No, no.  Not as many at all.  But there's a couple of these...  There's these fans that actually believe that it's still the glory days.  That calling up and going, you suck, Howard clones and Bob Bob Bowie.  Things like that are, like, relevant.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  But even still, why can't you, like, two...  You know, what's the difference?  Why can't you, like, start...  Oh, shut up, diplomat.  No, no, no.  It was an irritating little bit of...  Stop trying to put gems of wisdom.  You're a dumb guy.  You win.  Okay, that's a good point.  Relax.  He's never calling you to go on the show.  I don't, I...  Listen, you think I would...  You know...  First of all, you know I would...  I can't like steak and cheesecake.  Shut up.  Just relax.  Shut your face.  No, shut up.  When steak tells cheesecake it can't talk, cheesecake won't like steak.  Just ride this train and shut up.  You know I'm not... 
[01:50:30]  Just shut up.  Why can't they like bullshut?  Get off.  Why didn't the slave masters just look at the slaves as people and everybody get along,  you ideologue idiots.  I don't know.  Why didn't the Germans and the Jews shake hands in the 40s and cut all the malarkey out?  I don't understand.  Confused, naive little boy.  Oh, you know what?  Awful, wart-ridden man.  It's becoming more and more obvious to, you know, the people out there that Howard's  is calling it in, has been calling it in for years. 
[01:51:00]  All he does is come up with excuses why he can't do a radio show anymore, when the fact  is he just doesn't want to do a radio show anymore.  He doesn't.  He doesn't have to.  He signed up for his latest and last payday.  That's it.  Sirius and Mel over there, they're handing this guy half a billion dollars.  And you know what?  Godspeed.  Good for him.  Congratulations on your contract.  That's a lot of money.  But for anyone to sit out there and believe that this guy is doing this for the sake of  radio and to make his show better and to give the people a better program, you're just 
[01:51:30]  being stupid.  You'll see for yourself, I guess.  The guy's going to collect a check, and he really has given up.  He gave up a while ago.  And the whole, you know, everyone's ripping me off.  Oh, how?  You know, it even used to be funny.  It's starting to be very, very embarrassing.  But now it's really stupid.  Anything that's brought up, the guy insists he invented.  It's been that way for years.  It was funny to goof on for a while.  But now it's just sad.  It's like someone's grandpa sitting there just saying that, I remember that I came up 
[01:52:00]  with that one.  That was my idea.  Shut up.  You didn't invent everything.  When he says that one line during that wow thing, where it's like, tie the bandana around  the car, Fred.  Fred, tell him.  And he goes, I did it.  I did it all, he says.  He actually said, I did it all.  Which means, in radio, if you even have an inkling that you might come up with an original 
[01:52:30]  idea, just put it out of your mind.  Because he's already done it all.  He's covered it where you can't possibly come up with something.  He's now recently started doing a bit.  That is the hackiest, oldest radio.  Holy crap.  Bam.  That's a plane's wings ripping off.  Was that the old footage?  I think it was.  Wow.  Yeah, a plane just crashing without wings on Fox News.  We all have ADD, I know.  Where were we?  Yeah, he started talking about this bit he just started doing, right? 
[01:53:00]  That is the hackiest, oldest, one of the oldest radio bits.  Yeah.  I was doing it in college radio.  I did it at BAB.  And I'm not trying to say, you know, he ripped me off, you know, because that's ridiculous.  Because I just know, I know.  You picked it up from somewhere.  It's just something that was out there.  I just know of many, many shows that, you know, did this bit years ago.  I'm telling you, I got a tape of doing the same bit ten years ago, and now he's claiming that he came up with this thing,  and now he's pissed off because other guys are doing it.  Yeah.  It is the simplest thing. 
[01:53:30]  You guys out there could probably relate.  You probably did it with your friends.  You call two Chinese restaurants, and you get them to talk back and forth.  You know, you order from one guy, and then the other guy responds, and it goes back and forth.  But I was doing that ten years ago, and I know other guys that were doing it, you know, ten years ago, whatever.  It's a prank call that kids would do at home that just kind of made its way to radio.  So it's really embarrassing to hear that, you know, he finally discovers this bit that's been going on for years,  and now is claiming that people are ripping him off by doing this bit. 
[01:54:00]  It's like, dude, are you insane?  People could look up this stuff now.  You know, it's not like...  I was the first one to call a bowling alley and say, do you have ten-pound balls?  It's not like the old...  How do you walk?  That was me, Robin.  It's not like the old days where there was no Internet, so it's a lot tougher to, you know, check up on some of these things.  That's a bit that's been out there for years.  I mean, years.  It's your refrigerator running.  But you better catch it, because it's running.  Do you have Prince Albert in a can? 
[01:54:30]  I got a colored girl in a glass fishbowl.  I don't know how the joke goes, but...  It's a dunk tag, right?  That Jay Moore line about it being a dunk tag was just brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Ralph, what's up?  You know, another thing that that kiss-ass Dick Leno rips off is he's got this guy he calls Ross the intern.  Yeah.  You know, and... 
[01:55:00]  I don't know what that is.  And he, you know, he's just, he's an intern, you know, and he's like, here's Ross the intern.  Nobody did that before you.  Nobody knew what an intern was before you.  Now, you know what?  There's a guy, a fan, pumping him up.  Here's the difference between the shows.  If someone called in with that with us, we would fucking destroy you.  No one had interns, but, you know, his listeners have to, you know, stroke his ego, and he's  actually going to go with this call.  Now he's going to...  Like, it's serious. 
[01:55:30]  Now he's going to go with it.  But an intern was before you started profiling somebody like that, you know?  I see the way I've influenced television and what has gone down in the last...  Since I've got on in L.A., which...  Oh, my God.  You can't be serious.  Stop it.  It's an embarrassment.  It's embarrassing to listen to.  Howard, you're so out of touch.  You have no idea how embarrassed...  You sound like a doddering fool.  What a buffoon to stand...  To get on that mic and how he's influenced television and... 
[01:56:00]  Stop it.  Yeah, you know something?  The guy brought something to radio.  He absolutely did.  There's no denying that.  At the pinnacle of his career back in, you know, the late 80s, early 90s, the guy was  the hottest thing that radio had seen in, you know, some time.  But to get on and just claim that you invented everything and had this overall influence on  the entertainment industry, be realistic about what you did. 
[01:56:30]  You know, be proud of it, but realistic.  Christ, the guy is coming off like Jonas Salk.  He forgot how to have fun on the radio years ago.  Years ago.  Done.  Play, which is over, I don't know, 15 years.  Yeah.  Hugely.  Look at Friends.  The way they used to talk on that show, it was so, you know, the way you talk on the  show.  I know.  Even all the reality television, if you want to get right down to it.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:57:00]  What?  Reality television?  Was he saying Friends?  Did he say that Friends look at the way they talk on Friends?  Is this caller goofing on him?  Is this caller setting him up to look stupid?  He's doing a great job.  Did he actually say that Friends, the dialogue in the sitcom Friends, was influenced by the Howard  Stern show?  And Howard agreed?  Did I hear that?  I'm not even joking.  I want to know if I heard correctly. 
[01:57:30]  Let me hear that again.  Look at that show.  It was so, you know, the way you talk on the show.  I know.  I live in all the reality television.  Oh, okay.  I got to go way back.  I'm sorry.  Way back.  Friends.  You know, we'll just start over.  Fuck it.  Ralph, what's up?  You know, another thing that that kiss-ass Dick Leno rips off is he's got this guy he calls  Ross the intern.  Yeah.  You know, and I don't know what that is.  And he, you know, he's just, he's an intern, you know, and he's like, here's Ross the intern. 
[01:58:00]  Nobody did that before you.  Nobody knew what an intern was before you started profiling somebody like that, you know?  I see the way I've influenced television and what has gone down in the last, since I've  got on in L.A., which is over, I don't know, 15 years.  Hugely.  Look at Friends.  The way they used to talk on that show, it was, it was so, you know, the way you talk on  the show.  I know.  Even all the reality.  Wow.  Apparently this is Ralph, his hairstylist.  Oh, it is Ralph?  Okay. 
[01:58:30]  Just feeding, feeding, feeding Howard this shit, this drivel.  He did Friends.  Which, by the way, they plan in advance.  Of course.  Friends was, now I've never been a big fan of the show Friends, but I have caught some  episodes of the show Friends.  There is, you can't even come close to showing any kind of Howard Stern influence.  I don't know about, there was one, I don't watch it much, but there was one time where 
[01:59:00]  Chandler walked into the room, and I think it was David Schwimmer walked in, and he walked  in, and he goes, hey, how are you?  And I think Chandler said, I'm fine.  And I'm like, Jesus Christ, where is that from?  I'm like, that is such an original way of talking, that has to come from somewhere,  and I'm glad I found out where it was.  Yeah, well, okay.  Well, I'm wrong then.  Even all the reality television, if you want to get right down to it.  Hey, you know what?  It really pisses me off more than anything.  All the reality.  Oh, the reality television is directly linked to the Howard Stern show. 
[01:59:30]  Holy Jesus.  Hey, you know what?  It really pisses me off more than anything.  This telepictures who, we did a thing on the air for years called the Homeless Game.  Still do it.  And after I first, the first two times I did it on the air, the Homeless Game, I got  calls from every television guy out in L.A. saying we'd like to do, you know, because 
[02:00:00]  I said, I might develop a TV show like this, where we go out and ask people stuff, and  then we bet on it.  And they all called me, and I said, well, quite frankly, I don't need, including telepictures,  I said, I don't need you guys to do this.  I'll do it on my own.  And I started to develop it.  Yeah, sure.  Next thing I know, they got this show, Street Smarts.  Street Smarts, yeah.  It's in at six.  Is he claiming Street Smarts came from him?  I don't even know what Street Smarts is.  It's a game show where they have contestants in the studio, and they have to guess what 
[02:00:30]  people on the street are going to say an answer to a question.  So they'll have a question, you know, who invented the cotton gin, and then you'll have  three people on the street, and the people in the studio have to guess who's going to  get the right answer.  By the way, a very old radio bit.  Oh, stop.  An extremely old radio bit.  It's called Man on the Street.  It was done in the fucking 30s.  Steve Allen did it. 
[02:01:00]  It was done in the 30s.  They interviewed people at the Hindenburg crash.  Dude, Steve Allen did it with a microphone that was so big.  Right.  He needed two people to carry it.  Stop it already.  Because they didn't have the technology worked out back then, but he was doing it.  All the stuff that Howard said he came up with and wanted to develop, the only show he developed  is a rip-off of the naked gun things done on a beach.  That was pretty much it.  Every genius idea he never pursued, and eventually it was ripped off from him and someone else 
[02:01:30]  did it.  So the one time he actually did produce a show and put it out, it was a blatant rip-off  of the naked gun movies done on a beach setting.  What the hell is the Lifeguard series there?  On a beach?  No.  Oh, the one that was done with the tits and the fucking Baywatch.  Jesus Christ, I'm insane.  Baywatch.  By the way, I invented that.  It's a rip-off of Baywatch and the naked gun things.  It's all that pun-type humor and sight gags that the Zucker brothers did, and he took that, 
[02:02:00]  and that's the one he came up with.  All the brilliant ideas he passed by to have other people rip off from him, and that's  the one he came up with.  A blatant rip-off of the Zucker brothers.  Stop it.  You're an old fool.  Well, they got this show, Street Smarts.  Street Smarts, yeah.  It's in six seasons, and it's just like, I don't know, it's just so weird. 
[02:02:30]  And they called me at the time and said, and they just went ahead and did it on their  own, and I said, you know what, so what if they do it on their own?  They did it lame, but meanwhile, they've got six seasons.  It's worth it for six years.  They're making a lot of money off of it.  It's a horrible show.  I don't know, I mean, they make it not funny, and it somehow is successful.  But it's still doing well, and I'm such a jack-off, because I go, you know, when these  guys get a hold of stuff, they don't make it funny, it'll never succeed.  But it does, because the world accepts mediocrity.  Well, they ruined the evaluators.  Are you hot was a bad version of that.  Yeah, well, forget about that. 
[02:03:00]  Don't even bring that up.  Don't get started there.  They did kill that.  Don't get me nuts with that one.  But, you know, I mean, basically, these guys do take stuff and make it worse.  That's what makes it, and a whole generation of kids think it's, do you remember about  a year ago, we were in a meeting, and you pitched, someone pitched a version of the  street game, the homeless game, and one of the interns, who, you know, it's not his  fault, he said, that's just like street smarts.  Yeah.  I get a hundred letters a week, and people go, hey, man, I like how you rip off Jay Leno's 
[02:03:30]  bit, you know, whatever that's called.  Jay walking.  Jay walking.  And you want to just pound your head into the wall, because Jay Leno is so smug.  Stop exaggerating.  You're getting a hundred emails a week.  I'm saying, you're ripping off Jay Leno.  It's man on the street interviews.  This is a staple of radio.  It, Marconi did it. 
[02:04:00]  What the, this is not, how do you claim something that has been done for decades, for a century?  It's called a man on the street interview.  Whether it's serious, or you bring humor to it, it's still going out on the street and  interviewing people.  It's not ripping me off.  He doesn't even realize, in his head, he actually believes this.  What a fool.  Yeah, someone's got to email me the whole recap about how he was talking about the Chinese 
[02:04:30]  food prank, and how everyone's ripping that off.  Ripping that off.  A prank phone call.  A bit that's been done for a really long time.  Every radio guy.  Alexander Graham Bell did it to Watson.  He called him up and said, Watson, come quick.  I need Chinese food.  And then put a Chinese guy on the other end.  Every radio guy that attempted to do, you know, personality radio did that bit. 
[02:05:00]  Some really bad.  And some pulled it off and then did okay with it.  Spicknick is on the line here.  Spicknick, what's up?  Yo, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  I was just on the internet the other day, just bullshitting on eBounds World.  Yeah.  Dude, it's on there, and it's like a British DJ.  And it's the exact same fucking thing.  Oh, well, that's why I want to find the recap.  Because, like I said, you know, the prank is you call two Chinese restaurants, and they  go at each other.  They have no idea what's going on.  They think each place is ordering food, blah, blah, blah.  And it's really, really funny.  You've got to do it a bunch of times to get one that you could air on the air, right? 
[02:05:30]  So, I swear to you, I got a tape of doing it 10 years ago.  I'm not trying to claim anyone ripped me off, because I got it from somebody.  It's just one of these prank call staples that a lot of guys just used to do.  On radio, in frat houses.  So, Howard finally discovers this prank and does it, I guess, recently, okay?  Then someone calls and talks about the guy in Britain that did the exact same thing.  Howard actually says the guy had to have flown to America. 
[02:06:00]  No.  And heard his show, then flew back, and then did the prank on his radio show.  What an old buffoon.  But I can't find the recap where he talks about that.  What an idiot.  Someone brought it to our attention, because actually someone out there has the actual file  that I did years ago.  I guess it's on one of the file sharing boards or something.  I've read some emails and stuff from people and posts on the message boards that say,  you know, why do you even talk about them? 
[02:06:30]  Why do you even address things like this?  Because somebody, just somebody has to point this out.  Somebody, he's got, how many years has this guy gone on and just spouted this crap?  It has to occasionally be pointed out.  Well, you know, and you can make jokes, whatever, but I'm speaking up for a lot of the DJs that  were ripped off by Howard.  Yeah.  You know?  And then Howard, you know, squashes them and makes them look stupid, because, you know,  his listeners will believe whatever he says.  Yep.  And a lot of guys had some really, really creative bits out there that were stolen from, you know, 
[02:07:00]  that Howard stole.  But Bongo is one of the biggest ones.  It's a known fact.  And before the internet, you know, you could get away with that crap.  And he did.  And that's why, I'm convinced, that's why he yells and screams the most about how everyone's  ripping him off, because he's the biggest rip-off artist out there.  Two poor bastards trying to eke out a living on the radio in Maine came up with Butt Bongo.  They would play music and take the chick and have her naked and play the bongos on her ass.  And some caller called in to Howard and told him about that bit. 
[02:07:30]  And Howard goes, wow, that's really funny.  You know, there isn't anybody.  I can't believe radio guys actually came up with something funny.  And then as time went on, he started doing it.  And actually based a DVD or some kind of pay-per-view thing on the whole thing.  It was like, blatantly ripping off two guys.  Two poor bastards, don't even know who they are or anything.  And he goes on a daily basis and talks about how he just invented everything. 
[02:08:00]  He's going to get his ass killed on satellite radio.  Have fun over there at Sirius, man.  Have fun over there at the little doggy company.  Have fun with your buddy Mel over there.  Unless he figures out how to have fun on the radio again.  Because he hasn't had fun in years.  In years.  And he loves XM satellite radio.  He has one.  You know, he listens.  Yep.  He loves it.  You know, he wanted to come here.  But because of something that he has with Anthony and I, he refused to come over here.  That's fine.  Whatever.  The company said, well, whatever.  Have fun, you know. 
[02:08:30]  Because they're not basing their, XM's not basing their whole company around one stupid show.  It's just not how satellite radio is going to succeed.  It's just not going to succeed that way.  All right.  Here's Howard Stern talking about XM satellite radio.  And we know for a fact, because we still have friends over at the old company, he's furious.  He's gone to the company.  He's gone to his bosses.  And he said, please, you know, shut these guys up.  They're playing my audio on their show and goofing on me.  And the company, because they feel like they got screwed from, you know, by him. 
[02:09:00]  They're like, that's tough shit, buddy.  Yeah.  All they have to do is send it overseas and desist.  And they refuse to do it.  They will not do it for him.  You know?  Nope.  Because, and this is the beauty of what, why we're doing it.  Because in the old days, we would point out some of this dumb shit.  And we would get yelled at, screamed at behind the scenes, threatened to be fired and sued  and all sorts of stuff, because he couldn't handle it.  And he's still playing that game, but no one's listening anymore.  They're like, oh, well, Howard, you know, too bad.  Too fucking bad.  I invented that. 
[02:09:30]  So here's Howard Stern talking about XM satellite radio.  If you're planning a road trip this week, and it's time to take XM satellite radio along  for the ride, XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news,  sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio. 
[02:10:00]  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit,  so you can connect XM to any home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM is XM satellite radio.  Like sun is through the hourglass, so is the only name by us.  Is that it? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that's it.  I'll put it in my phone immediately.  There you go, please.  So you will never call it?  No, I'll call Adam.  Oh, sure you will.  I get those random calls every now and again.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But I'm the same way, kind of.  Yeah, see?  Like, how was the last time we just checked in?  It's not like we've got to have tea every week.  No.  We check in.  What are you doing?  How are you doing?  How are you being screwed over?  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's all you need, though, right?  Yeah, you just check in with your partner, okay?  We don't have discussions on the phone.  I don't think we ever really did.  No, we make each other laugh, and then a lot of it is grunt. 
[02:11:00]  And then, eh, eh, well, how are you doing?  Ah, fucking agent.  Yeah.  Ah, you know, I'm sure I'm going for this show.  And then I go, yeah.  Ah, ah.  And then he's like, how are you doing?  Ah, we got, you know, XM's calling, but Bob's talking to him.  It's taking forever.  I don't die.  And I don't, yeah.  Yeah.  And that's our conversation.  That's about it.  All right there, pal.  I'll tell you.  Are you all right?  You need anything?  No, I'm fine.  How about you?  How's the family?  Good, good. 
[02:11:30]  How's yours?  Ah, good.  You grunt, grunt, hang up.  And then, did you ever get this?  And then we're like, well, like, the girl, my girlfriend's like, so what'd you talk about?  Nothing, he's all right.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  So what's Adam doing?  Nothing.  Yeah, same stuff.  Yeah.  He's being funny.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  Yeah, it's the same thing.  What is, Late Show Friday's going to suck, but you do it?  I mean, it's the same.  That's pretty much our call conversation.  My father, I think it just happens to all, my father's down to grunts. 
[02:12:00]  He's not even a disability.  He doesn't even throw any earth in.  How's he feeling, pop?  Hey, shit.  How's mom?  How's mom?  I'm not feeling too good.  Yeah, I think I'm depressed.  Yeah, welcome to earth.  Try living with your mother.  She's a carrier.  Yeah, when you become, like, really close friends for many years, you just don't have  those conversations on the phone.  It's the same check-in.  Those conversations you have with people that you just, you're kind of friendly with, or 
[02:12:30]  you haven't talked to in a while, but you just run out of shit to say.  Then you catch up and stuff.  What do I got to tell Adam about?  You know, oh, I'm getting a new couch.  Well, no, the first, it's always the check.  The first, is family's all right?  Yeah.  It's good, sounds good.  All right, good.  We all go through the family.  Then how's work?  And it's always, that's where it's.  That's the grunting comes from.  Did you do anything cool?  Yeah, we had it.  Sunset Town.  Stratopolis doing the news.  Really?  Okay.  I got to go. 
[02:13:00]  All right, pal.  See you later.  That's it.  No, text me.  As a matter of fact, I'm taking your number.  I don't need it now that I think about it.  Forget it.  I'm taking you out of my book.  I really don't have to call.  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:13:30]  We've still got a lot of show to do today.  We've got to get Sandy Kane in here, huh?  Yeah.  We've got a quick, interesting story, though.  Yeah.  It popped up.  A shocking story surfacing within the La Jolla School District has many parents on edge.  Police say two six-year-old boys were performing sexual acts on each other on campus.  That's right.  They're a magic act.  Was there a porch involved?  We were told the two six-year-old boys in question were performing oral sex on each other in the restroom. 
[02:14:00]  And school parents very upset.  Another six-year-old student walked in, saw what happened, a little Budinsky.  Loose lips sink ships.  I almost screwed that up.  You certainly did.  Loose lips ships.  And children are now being monitored as they go to the bathroom.  Ooh, who gets that lucky job? 
[02:14:30]  Stand over the shoulder, peek.  Can you get a heart on at six years old?  Wow, I have no idea.  Jim, can they?  Two parents contacted Action 4 News, complaining because the little boys were only given counseling  and a brief in-school suspension.  What are you supposed to do to these kids?  Suspend them for what?  It's stupid little boy experimentation stuff, but what are you supposed to do?  Suspend them and beat them? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Obviously, it's not something new.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I mean, I've heard that a lot of little boys have had those, ha, ha, ha, little things.  Something like this has gone on in the past?  Sure.  Maybe it's not a completely normal thing that everyone does, but obviously it's been done  in the past under different names, I'm sure.  Absolutely.  You just let it happen, and sooner or later, one of them will grow up and talk about his  little fat stomach for a living.  Kids might have called it a creature precipitation, something like that. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, but probably one of them, there might be, like, molestation there.  And one kid...  There might be what?  I'm just going to let him a mouthful.  Whatever it's called, you know, fucking pedophilia or whatever.  No, not pedophilia.  Molestation?  Yeah, molestation.  That's what I said.  Mollusks were in there.  And that's why kids...  Some form of sea rifle.  You finger a barnacle before it's eight.  A mollusk might have happened.  Oh, no, Bonnie calls me the idiot know-it-all. 
[02:16:00]  The other day, you know what I said?  Annie Lennox was on, and I'm trying to be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she used to sing  with the arithmetics, I said to her.  The arithmetics.  And Bonnie looked at me and goes, you're just a fucking dummy.  And when I was getting gray in my hair, she goes, it's horrible, because now people are  going to think you're intelligent, and then you open your mouth.  She is funny. 
[02:16:30]  She's the distinguished gray on your pimples.  I know.  And then you open your mouth, and it just ruins everything.  What was the crack line she was saying in the green room last night, in between shows?  God damn, I don't remember.  We were talking about, you know, obviously...  Addictions and stuff.  The addiction, and your old addiction with crack, Voss's addiction that he used to have.  And I guess my addiction with video games came up, and I said something like, well, at  least to get a video game, I didn't have to suck any dick.  And Bonnie said that Voss would smoke the crack just so he could suck the dick. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, she just smashes him.  Oh, just at every turn, she's bashing him, and it's hysterical.  We were in the elevator, all of us were in the elevator, and we were talking about how  when Rich walked out and got that huge ovation, and she goes, yeah, it was the first time  I thought I made the right decision.  She said to me, though, she goes, you know, I thought you said you had a house, not a townhouse.  And I go, well, I thought you said you had 40 minutes. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Townhouse, who was ragging?  Oh, Patrice was just ragging your connected house.  That jackass has a roommate in an apartment.  He was ragging about your make-believe house.  My fucking place is nice.  I took the tour, you know, after playing golf.  Yeah.  He bought an apartment.  I was happy for you, but I'm not feeling the old furniture, though.  I got antiques.  I got stuff in there that's so nice.  If your grandmother was a gay male, that's how my house is decorated. 
[02:18:00]  I got nice, what, because I don't have shit from Ikea?  No, because you don't have shit after 1980.  You have a great couch if you want to watch Raging Bull on it.  Listen, I feel like your apartment is haunted.  The stuff is so old.  Is it really?  You got a lot of old stuff in there?  I got, like, antiques.  You know, I go antique in, well, garage sales, and I like to refurbish.  I do the stuff over myself a lot of it.  You don't like your stuff in garage sales?  No, no.  You wanted to say refurbish, and I do it over myself.  A lot of this stuff, I used to, when I had real major anxiety, I used to have to find 
[02:18:30]  ways to keep myself busy, so I would buy, like, old armoires or stuff like that, and  I would redo them.  They just look uncomfortable.  No, yeah, the couch is pretty uncomfortable.  It's a nice Victoria.  I got some fucking, I got artwork in there that's, like, $200, $300.  What are you talking about?  I mean, I got expensive shit.  No, I got some nice antiques.  Get rid of the old junk.  No, I got nice, you never, listen.  I mean material.  You have a picture of you on stage at Woodstock, right? 
[02:19:00]  I have two walls of, like, a lot of my stuff where the Oscars I wrote on stage at Woodstock,  I was on the big Sony screen New Year's Eve one year.  You know, I just got, like, you know, like, he has a wall with him and all celebrities.  What?  You could have got a better photograph of this stuff.  Like, blown up Kodak Instamatics.  I got some fucking cool stuff.  Look, you know, you could trash my place.  I'm not trashing.  I started this by saying I'm happy for you.  Yeah, I'm just not feeling the old furniture, that's all.  Yeah, well, everybody has different tastes, you know. 
[02:19:30]  Get some new furniture.  You know, it's the fuck Howard told me to get it, so I ran out and got that kind of stuff.  Why can't you like new furniture and old furniture?  Make a stand once in your awful life.  No, I do make a lot of stands.  I was just going to say Kofi.  Wow.  I have never had somebody say Kofi Annan as it was about to come out of my mouth.  Holy shit.  Hey, boss, have you ever done the news for us?  No.  It could be fun is all I'm thinking. 
[02:20:00]  Why?  How do you do the news?  What do you mean?  Maybe next time you come in, we'll have you do the news.  I'll fucking do the news.  I know what's going on.  All right.  Fucking well read.  No, yeah, you actually have a news report and everything.  You know, stories in front of you.  And shit, yeah?  Yeah.  Fuck, I'd love to do it.  I think that could be a lot of fun, actually.  Let's go to, you want to go to Sandy Kane, finally?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, let's get Sandy Kane in here.  Wow, we've never been on at this hour.  Wow, we're supposed to be off the air by now, no?  Yeah.  We're doing an extra show today.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sandy Kane. 
[02:20:30]  Hey.  How are you doing, guys?  I missed you.  Well, you've got to get up by the mic there, Sandy.  Take a seat.  Okay.  And pull that mic up to your mouth.  Okay.  She looks like Dolly Parton with AIDS.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Dildo, man.  I'm not offended.  I love to be, you know, I think I'm really into S&M.  Um, I just can't wait to be abused.  Really?  My mother abused me, so.  Did she?  Uh-huh. 
[02:21:00]  What did she do to you?  My mother's a bisexual.  Really?  Yeah.  If my father didn't buy us something, she didn't feel sexual.  Your mother really abused you or no?  Oh, yeah.  No, not physically.  Well, um, in a way she did.  Yeah?  Really?  Did she beat you around a little bit, smack you?  No, Joe sent me to dentists.  What?  Joe sent me to dentists.  Right, and you've had that big problem with the dentists.  I remember hearing that story.  I'm going to cry, she.  But, you know, um.  Oh, I forgot about it.  Remember?  She had a problem with the dentist knocking her teeth out or something? 
[02:21:30]  Right, right, right.  What happened?  Right, right, right.  But that's why, you know.  Hold on, hold on.  Because we, Sandy, we got to, yeah, we got to get right into this.  I mean, we have a whole new audience now.  We're hurt all over the country.  You got to tell the dentist story again.  I forgot all about that.  You were dating a dentist?  Dating?  No, no.  I was addicted to dentists because of my mother.  She was addicted to dentists?  Yeah, I was addicted to dentists and the drill and stuff.  Maybe it might have been sexual, but my mother always sent me to dentists, and I just want  to advise anyone that dentists are the worst people. 
[02:22:00]  Usually you don't, you know, teeth heal more than people know it, because now I can't go  to one, and because it's just almost, you know, futile.  But I did get one female dentist that had a heart.  Wait, you're really, you are off on a tangent here.  Stay focused, Sandy.  Okay.  Stay focused.  But what is a dentist abuse?  I came here for therapy.  The dentist, now.  Yeah.  What happened that you got addicted to dentists?  Well, every time I think I had a big mouth, my mother would send me to dentists.  By the way, she has, you know, she had a problem there, too. 
[02:22:30]  Olivia.  With dentists?  Yeah, maybe her mother sent her to one.  So wait a minute.  It didn't have anything to do with your teeth.  If you, like, smart-mouthed her, she'd send you to the dentist, because your mouth was  being bad, so she would then have your teeth drilled.  I think it was a lot more, like, she would abuse me, so my teeth would hurt, and then she  would send me to the dentist, and then he would drill unnecessary teeth, which they do.  Oh, she's Olivia, the dentist.  They really do.  Wow.  And I have a big problem.  Sandy, what year was this about? 
[02:23:00]  1900 and...  1800 and...  What was it then?  Um, you know, what was it, 60s, 70s, you know?  Really, 70s?  60s, 70s, you know.  How old a gal are you, Sandy?  Can you keep a secret?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's mine.  How old are you?  I never really.  Are you over 45?  You're over 45, so in the 70s, you were at least 15.  Well, the thing is, I've been having problems, but now I have nothing to drill, so, you know... 
[02:23:30]  Oh, so you can say that again.  No, I can just help anyone out here.  It's 60s, in the 60s or 70s, it doesn't sound like...  Well, I have to get...  What's the difference, man?  Hey, hold on.  I'm a woman, I'm touchy about my age.  No, no, no, that's fine, I'm just saying.  No, no, I don't care about your age anymore.  I know men are.  Sandy, I don't care about your age anymore.  In the 60s or 70s, it just seems to me like, how is your mother still sending into these dentists?  Right, when you were 30.  It seemed like you were a little older.  Well, I was addicted, and I would go by myself.  You'd go by yourself?  Yeah.  Because now, because your mother sent you there to be punished, just about, you became addicted to this? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Because, is this some kind of a self-deprecating thing, some kind of a...  I don't know, I really felt I needed a dentist.  You felt you needed...  And then you would go to the dentist, and what, did you have cavities, or you'd just tell them, drill?  Well, there was so much work done, and then it needed more work done, and I was always so used to,  when something dramatic happened, or traumatic, I'd go to the dentist, when it was really,  maybe, my love life sucked.  I'm a stripper, I hated my life.  You know, sometimes it hit my mouth, but sometimes it passes, and now, when, you know, like, 
[02:24:30]  I was supposed to do this show, and my mouth, like, don't do this show, your mouth, you know.  But, um, I did it anyway, because I know now that, um, it's just, it will pass, and the devil tries to get you in certain ways.  Are you still, you still have this, um...  Well, look.  Well, let me see.  You know, it's horrible.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  So why?  You look.  It's horrible.  Open your gap.  No, man.  Christopher, open your gap.  Yeah, I know.  Mr. Walking, gee, he's a bad mouth, too. 
[02:25:00]  No, but you sound like him just there.  Oh, okay.  If you say something dirty, did you, like, your father wash your mouth out with cock?  I mean, like, what kind of family did you have?  Oh, no.  They were nice Jewish, very, very strictly.  You're not a Jew.  Don't say you're a Jew.  She's a Jew.  Of course she is.  She's a Jew?  Of course.  With a cross?  Look at that outfit.  What, did you get the cross on sale?  Look at the tits.  Was either a Jew or Aussie in 1972?  Look at the big titties.  The Jewish tits.  But, no, I mean, Jesus saved me.  He saved me.  Really?  Yeah.  From dentists?  Yeah, from just life.  You know, you just go to church, and you're fierce. 
[02:25:30]  What kind of Jew, that whole Jesus and Jew thing, it's all bullshit, okay?  Can't you like Jesus and Jews?  Yeah.  Right?  He was a Jew, though.  Jesus was a Jew.  We know that.  Jesus was Puerto Rican.  Three crosses.  So, how old were you when your parents started sending you to the dentist?  Oh, about seven, eight, nine years old.  So, 53 years ago, your mom was sending you to a dentist?  Yeah.  I was very young.  Yeah, when Jim was bad, his father would send him to a proctologist.  Well, my mother had a thing with doctors, man. 
[02:26:00]  Everything was, went to the doctor, to the doctor, to the doctor, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like, you know, they were just weird, with doctors.  Wow, and dentistry back then must have just been a treat.  Yeah.  Wow.  And it still sucks, and it still sucks, and it still sucks, because I still call dentists,  and they still suck.  When was the last time you've been to a dentist?  Well, I just called one the other day, man, and they, you know, it's just, like, weird.  Wait, why did you call a dentist the other day?  Because I'm having a certain problem.  What?  There's a certain something that's kind of coming out.  You got a toothache.  No, it wasn't a toothache. 
[02:26:30]  You need a root canal.  You need a tooth pulled.  No, there aren't much, you know, it's just, I did, I was having a problem.  Was it a problem that a dentist?  My dentist, a female dentist, moved to Canada, so, you know.  But was it a problem that a dentist could solve, or is it a problem that you're having that  you just automatically go to a dentist because you're crazy?  Well, I had gone to this female, and she was all right, you know, although she wanted, you know,  she just, they always do unnecessary work.  What was the problem that you had?  What was the problem?  What was the problem?  I had something, you know, that needs to be kind of soldered in.  Soldered in?  Go to a welder.  Kind of circuit board.  No, man, you know, it's a big problem. 
[02:27:00]  What?  Don't we all have problems?  What has to be soldered in?  Well, can you do it?  What is it?  Can you do it?  You never know with him.  You get really turned on by the dentist's business?  I used to, kind of.  I think the drill, like, was better.  But now, does your dentist not work on lower teeth, just upper teeth?  No, there was a dentist that put solution on my mouth.  What the fuck were you doing?  Oh, yeah, that's what he called it.  I gave him a copy.  I love Dick.  His name was Dick.  And I had a show on the air, and I'm wearing crosses, and they're Jews.  And I had this body show where I curse on public access. 
[02:27:30]  And they just got together, and they said, Luna, fuck her.  And they did.  She went to a dentist.  No, and I got him off the chair.  And he put some kind of solution on her teeth that made him rot away.  No.  And you didn't show him as a good Jew?  He said, in three years, your teeth will fall out.  And in three years, they did.  And there's a time limit.  I said, oh, no, my teeth are all right.  But he knew exactly three years from that date, they fell out.  What did they possibly put on your teeth that three years later?  Pop rocks. 
[02:28:00]  I'm telling you.  What, did you not brush it off?  He didn't put anything on your teeth.  You're really, yeah, that's like a little paranoid thing.  Oh, well, that's what you say, man.  No, no, that's right.  In three years, my teeth fell out.  Yeah.  Really?  Dentists know how to hurt you and help you.  And there's a lot of bad doctors and dentists out there.  Relief.  Discomfort.  He did not put anything on your teeth that made them rot.  I believe that.  I don't think they did.  I think you kind of...  How do you know that?  Well, I don't.  You never got fucked up by a dentist?  No.  I don't think there's any solution that takes three years. 
[02:28:30]  You have never gotten fucked up by a doctor or a dentist?  Any dentist I have gone to has helped me.  Just the other week, just to last week, I had a toothache because a root canal wasn't  completed the way it should have been 15 years earlier.  So I went upstairs to a friendly dentist that's right in this very building, and he fixed me  up, and then I went to another dentist who did the root canal properly, fixed it up.  I'm totally fine now.  Wow.  He helped me.  How come they like the...  Look at these teeth.  I went to Steinway. 
[02:29:00]  Look at them.  That was a piano reference.  It wasn't that bad.  Okay, so one bad one.  Not all killers.  I don't blame you, man.  I look in the mirror, too, and it's hard.  It's hard being ugly.  I'm amazed by this obsession with dentists.  I am, too.  I've never heard of somebody.  Well, how could someone obsessed with dentists have such awful teeth?  How does that work out?  No, because it's a problem.  Are you also obsessed with hairstylists?  Do you like my new Paris Hilton?  Wow. 
[02:29:30]  Is that what you're going for?  Yeah.  I just, I think, you know, the light color.  You look like Calcutta.  The light color, I thought.  You know, it's like being a blonde.  You might as well really be a blonde, because, you know, like, you know, Gene Harlow and,  and, you know, O.P.U.s and, you know, light color.  D. Snyder.  D. Snyder.  D. Snyder.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying.  Hey, it's cool.  You look like D. Snyder, yeah.  Wow.  Well.  You ought to look at toothpaste and sing, I'm not going to take it. 
[02:30:00]  I took it.  It's too late.  It's too late, baby.  But you have to move on anyway, you know, and I'm really.  Anthony, I want to break out an old bit here.  Really?  I want to guess Cindy Kane's age.  Ooh.  35 to the third power.  Would you let me try to guess your age?  Well, now there's a certain way.  Sure.  Okay.  There's a certain way he does it, though.  Ah.  Do you remember?  You know how people chop down trees and they count the rings and they can tell how old  the tree was? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Opie uses a technique.  No, you won't be getting cut in half.  Might be a fun thing to do anyway, but.  No, he's got a way that, like the.  Counting of rings.  What, he looks in your asshole?  Well.  I just have a feeling, man.  Wow.  He's into ass.  He's into ass.  No, no, no, no, no.  You are good.  Let's slow down here.  I know you're into ass, man.  I look at the whole area.  Look at the taint.  Ah.  The taint.  The most of the taint area.  He's a kinky guy.  He's going to have to do yours due to Hubble Telescope, though.  Man, I love to show my ass. 
[02:31:00]  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, see it.  Can I guess your age?  I remember the first time that I showed him my ass, it was like such a connection.  If he looks at your taint, he can then.  And that's such a great ass.  I wish I could put it on my head.  Will you be honest if I guess your age that way?  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  Yeah, let's see.  Can we take it one minute at a time?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, sure.  I'm glad I took a bath.  Ah.  One minute at a time.  And we also want to see how Twato's doing.  Oh, fine, man.  Yeah?  Have you ever seen Twato?  I don't know.  All these years hanging with us, you've never seen Twato? 
[02:31:30]  I don't think so.  Maybe.  I don't know.  If I did, I'd try to blank it out of my mind.  Yeah.  Has it gotten bigger or smaller or anything?  Stay the same.  Stay the same.  I missed you guys.  Missed us.  No, I still come into comedy clubs and say, hey, ask Twato.  How's Twato?  Really?  I got a big fan of Twato.  Of course.  The comic.  You know Maurice?  Oh, yeah.  He's a comic.  You can't say Maurice and comic in the same sentence.  Okay.  He's not a good guy.  He's not a good comic.  Well, he loves Twato anyway.  He listens to you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Big fan.  Now, we talked earlier about the crosses.  Are you Jewish or are you Catholic?  I'm both.  You're both.  Sometimes I'm Jewish and sometimes I'm not.  You know, when it gets to, you know, sometimes I'm Jewish.  Because the difference between Jew and Gentile, a Gentile, every time something good happens,  he says, thank you, Jesus, man.  I wasn't smart enough to do this.  But a Jew says thanks to themselves.  Thank you.  I did it myself.  I showed up here.  But the Gentile says thank you, Jesus, for bringing it up. 
[02:32:30]  So the Jew's more realistic.  All right.  Sometimes so.  Sometimes it's really great to have Jesus by your side.  All right.  Listen, we want to take a look at Twato.  Okay.  I want to try to guess your age.  And also, I hear you.  You didn't need him.  I've also heard that you have a song for us.  Oh, yeah.  A welcome back song.  Yeah, this really, I read this stepping out, man, in the laundry, man.  There you go.  Man, and all of a sudden, I started singing, Opie and Anthony are back, and I'm glad.  Not yet.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Opie wants to guess your age. 
[02:33:00]  Okay.  All right.  Look at him.  So serious.  Well, what do we want to do first?  The song?  The age guessing?  Or...  By the way, my CD is at Tower Records in the comedy section at Lincoln Center.  This is my new...  Do they know you put it there?  It's called Tits My Party.  Tits My Party.  What?  Let me see.  It's called Tits My Party.  Oh, instead of It's My Party.  Oh, Tits My Party.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I had no clue what the hell that meant.  All right.  Tits My Party Rock?  My next CD, I'll have your song.  Her CD's the only CD.  I had to bring four other CDs.  The other one, they wouldn't have that one. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, the cover.  My titty's on fire.  Yeah, the Walmarts wouldn't cover...  It's only one store.  It's only one show.  Well, some of the tracks off Sandy King's comedy CD.  Let's see.  George Clooney.  Tits My Party, of course.  Don't be cruel.  I want to hold your gland.  I will swallow him.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Let me suck your cock.  Oh, I remember the Jerry Seinfeld song from the old days.  Little Penis.  My Boyfriend's Black.  And I Love Dick. 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  No, but they made me stick her the back, so I couldn't...  But Tits My Party, they're allowing the word tits, you know.  All right.  Very good.  Kids are only 18...  Should we play a track from her CD?  Should she sing the Welcome Back song?  Should we guess her age?  Help me out here, Andy.  Well, I think first we should just reintroduce ourselves with Twato.  Oh, thanks.  All right.  I think that's...  Twato, man.  Yeah, let's...  If I would have taken that off, it wouldn't have been a good radio show, you see?  You're right. 
[02:34:30]  See, I didn't have to take it off.  Very smart.  And you're still convinced it's what?  A shaving accident that went wrong?  It's just something that I was meant to have you guys exploit.  Right.  Tetherball.  Yeah, but what is it?  No, I'm just saying...  What do you think it is?  I forget what you used to tell us.  I remember shaving once.  You know, I was like a bottomless dancer.  Yeah.  And on 42nd Street and 8th Avenue at this place called Las Vegas Bar.  And I said, you know, my pussy is too hairy.  I said, yeah.  And everyone's shaving their pussy those days. 
[02:35:00]  You know, they have that, you know, the little girl type of pussy.  So I said, let me shave.  So I did.  And I think that's what happened.  And I never shaved again.  Really?  Because I can swear that happened from shaving.  But...  Yeah, she hasn't shaved down there in a long time.  I don't think it was a shame.  So you have a big bush.  It looks like someone's hiding in there.  Yeah.  A little Vietnamese guys in your fucking snapper hiding there.  Right.  Right.  Like your beard if you let it grow.  Ugh.  You know, or your bald hair.  It looks like a flesh mushroom sticking out of her pew.  It is...  There you go. 
[02:35:30]  Flesh mushroom.  A fleshy mushroom.  It looks like a character from Lord of the Rings.  Why do you get somebody to come in here and lick it for like a my fire?  We've done it.  Yeah, we've done it.  Yeah, we've done it.  The doctors.  They said I had cancer.  We've done it all.  What's that?  They all said I had cancer.  Yeah.  Huh?  They all said I had cancer.  It's a genital wart.  It's a genital wart, but she will not admit it.  Never.  It is a genital wart.  Yeah, let's take the pants off.  Ugh.  Yeah, let's take a look at Clotto.  Hey, hey, hey, you know, I don't know.  My pussy's like up for it, you know.  But anyway, um...  Yeah, let's take a look at Clotto.  In other words, you could...  You...  Opie, in other words, you could tell my age by my... 
[02:36:00]  By...  I'm not positive.  I haven't done this in a while.  You're taint.  And my pussy?  You could tell my age?  No, you're taint.  I learned early on in my...  Is it my asshole or my pussy?  I learned early on in my life that I had this talent, but I haven't done it in a while,  so I don't know.  I don't know if I got the skills.  Is that why I'm here?  What?  What do you think?  What do you think?  Wait for Ricky.  I want Ricky to see, too, because Ricky...  Yeah, Ricky, get in here, Ricky.  You got to stay.  I got my weapon on.  All right.  Okay.  Ricky, this is Sandy Kane. 
[02:36:30]  Sandy Kane has taken off her...  What are you wearing?  Leotards or something?  No, they're jazz pants.  Jazz pants.  Jazz pants, huh?  Yeah.  Woof.  I hate jazz.  All right.  It's awful.  Oh, my gosh.  Boots.  Go-go boots.  Yeah, my go-go boots.  Go-go boots.  I mean, what would you do if one of these things showed up in your apartment?  Without a cock, throw them out.  Hey, Dildo, I'd talk with Dildo with me.  I know.  We see...  She has a vibrator that she talks to. 
[02:37:00]  It's Dildo.  The name's Dildo or...  Talking to the mic.  You got to talk into the mic there.  Talking to the mic.  All right.  All right.  Your vibrating Dildo is just slowly rotating around the room.  Dildo is so happy to see O and A, right?  Look at you.  I'm not...  I think the batteries are dead.  That's what Joan Rivers would look like without all that plastic surgery.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Okay.  She's older than me.  That's...  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm going to take that over to me.  Someone is older than me.  All right.  So I love Joan. 
[02:37:30]  Let's take the...  This is Joan Rivers.  Can we talk?  Let's take a look at Twato.  Okay.  We definitely want to see...  Show it.  Don't be shy.  Yeah, don't be shy.  Have you seen you've seen Twato?  Yeah, I don't care.  Pull your pants down.  We've all seen you've seen it.  Pull out.  Pull your pants down.  Pull your pants down.  Yeah, we got to see that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, Richie.  Rich is throwing up.  Wow.  Rich is throwing up. 
[02:38:00]  It's gotten bigger.  It's gotten bigger.  It's gotten bigger.  It's gotten bigger.  Oh, you should see like Gene Wilder.  It looks like a brain in a jar in a lab.  Rich threw up.  Matt, look at him.  Wow, look at all the hair that's piling out of those.  Hey, you know, it's better than your performance.  It's on Liz Cummichon.  Wow.  Touche.  Here we go.  Why don't we invite all the interns in?  They're all brand new.  Yeah, they've got to come out.  Yeah, you guys, you've got to be Twato. 
[02:38:30]  You've never seen Twato.  This is a special day on the Opinion Program.  Look at all the hair that's coming out of the side of your panties.  That's why I shaved, and that's how I got Twato.  I have a very hairy pussy.  Wow.  And very well-endad pussy, too.  Do you have big lips?  Look.  Let's see it.  Show it.  I can't see it.  Yeah, pull your pants down.  Show me the other side.  When did you become shy?  My God, you used to take your panties off all the time.  Show your vag from the other side without the Twato.  Oh, yeah, here.  Look.  Here's the good side.  I can't see.  Pull it aside. 
[02:39:00]  This is the good side.  Pull it aside so I can see the lips.  Close up.  Pull it all the way aside.  You know, that is awful.  Teddy, pull it all the way aside.  Is your pussy going through chemo or something?  What is going on down there?  Looks like Ron Howard's head.  Sort of wispy.  Yeah, you've got to show Twato for the boys who've never seen it.  Yeah.  Here's Twato, guys.  Take a look.  These guys are very young.  Look at that again.  Oh, Jesus.  Boss, come on.  Look.  Rich, look at it.  Look at it. 
[02:39:30]  Look at it, Rich.  Have a sense.  He's gagging.  No, it's really a heart shape.  Remember Valentine's Day?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  What is that?  Jesus, put an APB on that.  Fucking.  Rich, can't take it.  Rich, would you suck that into your mouth really slow?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Somebody actually sucked on that.  Somebody's fucking that?  It's like a speed bump by the pussy.  I haven't had sex in a long time.  I can't imagine why.  Look at that thing. 
[02:40:00]  Really?  Mr. Polo.  Polo.  Polo sucked on that.  Who?  Polo.  Remember Polo from Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  That fat guy?  Yeah.  With the fat stomach?  He got on his knees and he sucked on.  He did not.  He sucked on Twato.  I sucked his dick, but he didn't suck Twato.  Isn't there one in the back door, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, you have a hemorrhoid.  Yeah.  She's happy about this.  Her pussy looks like a rubber glove hanging and she's happy.  What can I do, Rich?  What am I going to kill myself?  Get it cut off. 
[02:40:30]  That's what everybody does with those.  Yeah, but then I couldn't be on here and expose it.  You could take it around in a jar with you.  Yeah.  Just, no.  I mean, I like it.  I like my Twato.  Oh, usually.  I have fans because it's Twato.  Usually that sparkle thing looks really hot on women.  What do you got, some sparkly stuff on you?  Yeah.  Looks like Diana Ross threw up on her.  Why Diana Ross?  You got to show him the Roy.  You got to see the Roy, dude.  You have to.  You're part of the crew.  You have to see the Roy.  Yeah, yeah.  Please.  I don't think it's out, man. 
[02:41:00]  Let's just see.  Hey, Sandy, would you do something for us?  Sure.  Would you smell the back of Rich Boss's ear?  It's not that bad.  It smells like grape jelly.  Like grape jelly.  What is it?  It smells like grape jelly.  It's his cologne he wears, and it smells like grape jelly.  It's stupid.  So he's going to rub behind his ear, and then you smell his finger.  That's all.  It smells like grape jelly.  Look, his hands are clean.  This is no gag.  He's not going to have shit, maybe.  All right.  No, no.  It doesn't have shit behind you.  Okay.  What?  You never know.  Well, get the mic up there for them.  Okay. 
[02:41:30]  He's drooling.  Oh, no.  No, really.  It's disgusting.  Oh, man.  But you know it smells like my own asshole.  I guess an asshole smells like an asshole.  Boy, we got a new soundboard.  Hey, how do you keep an asshole in suspense?  I'll tell you later. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, that is disgusting, Rich.  No, get the fuck away from me.  I'll lose my mind.  Ricky never took it.  Yeah, Ricky.  Ricky, get in here.  Everyone else has taken it, Ricky.  Everyone else has taken it.  It's not that bad.  We'll explain this to the new listeners in a second.  It's not that bad, Ricky.  Get the mic on, Ricky.  Get the mic on, Ricky.  Smell.  You've got to inhale.  Oh, shit.  It's disgusting.  It's horrible.  Sandy, what did it smell like?  Like an asshole. 
[02:42:30]  Was it?  Really?  Yeah.  At that point, Rich, I thought, man, you're Jewish?  You sure?  This makes my ears good.  Pew, pew.  It's only my left ear, though.  I always knew you were an asshole.  Now I know it.  What do you got?  A little tumor?  How do you explain it again, Rich?  I was shaving behind my ear when I was a kid.  I don't touch anything.  Ew, it's disgusting.  Explain it for the new listeners.  I don't know what.  They say it's like from a cyst.  You get a cyst.  But the cyst isn't out.  It's like...  I had a cyst taken out. 
[02:43:00]  Listen.  Wow.  It builds up behind his ear, and he makes people smell it every once in a while, and  that's the reaction we get every single time.  And when you get it from her, you know it's bad.  Between her showing that and grossing him out, and him making her smell that, and him grossing  it out.  It's like two evil superheroes battling with their powers of disgust.  Really?  Oh, I really thought that was his asshole.  I thought that's what he did.  You got to show the roids.  Show him the roids.  He doesn't believe it.  Show him the roids.  Show him the roids.  Strike back.  I should have had next to him.  Yeah, strike back.  That is just awful. 
[02:43:30]  Sandy, when did you get so shy?  Why are you so shy?  Rip those panties off like a man.  You got any cocaine?  No, I mean...  You got any cocaine?  Coke really makes me horny.  Yeah?  All right, make sure there's none in the building.  I can curse, man.  Anthony always said, shut up, shut up.  Now you can curse.  I can say, fuck you.  Yep.  All right.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Wait, no, I've seen it.  Turn to Rich. 
[02:44:00]  Show Rich now.  You know, I got to tell you, your ass has held up.  I know.  What?  Let me see.  Look at her.  Let me see it.  Hey, I look pretty good, don't I?  Let's see the S. Very good.  From the neck down?  Well, I would start from the belly button.  Hell, hold up.  It looks like Keith Richards.  I know.  Dude, look at your hair.  I got beautiful titties.  Sandy, Sandy.  You want a titty fuck?  Sandy, turn around a minute.  Let's see your ass.  Look at the hair.  Wait.  Like poking out.  You weren't in South Beach a year and a half ago, were you?  All right, here we go, Rich.  No, show the...  Where's the hemorrhoid? 
[02:44:30]  Spread them.  No, you open it and spread them.  No one can see that.  Not over here.  Show Rich.  I don't think the hemorrhoids do it.  Just show it.  I don't think the hemorrhoid's out.  There's some guy's back with the hemorrhoid.  Boss goes down.  Their evil powers have overtaken Rich's smelly ear.  Oh, that's a smelly ear.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  No, I don't think my hemorrhoid's out, man.  You're just going to see a crack.  There's something in there, fucking living.  Go, go, go, go.  I see something in there. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, Mary.  Oh, Jesus.  How old am I?  How old am I?  Oh, he's got to check.  He's got to look at the tent.  I have to do the whole, you know, thing.  How can you look at that without getting sick?  Hairy or hemorrhoid.  What's wrong with my ass?  Why don't you take your pants off and set your ass?  No.  I better have a nicer ass than you.  You better.  You're abroad.  Hey, I'm abroad, but, you know.  Am I going to try to guess your age?  Actually, I've got a nice ass.  Should we guess the age?  Let's see.  Let's see your ass.  Come on.  It looks like Rutherford B. Hayes with a cold sore. 
[02:45:30]  Let's see your ass, Rich.  Come on.  You have a nice body.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  I feel awful now.  See, now it's your dick, too.  Let's see.  I've got a picture of my dick.  I wouldn't let you.  You look at my dick for good.  Why not?  Which one with me?  When was the last time you had some sex there, Sandy?  Too long.  Is anyone, you know.  How long?  Steve.  Steve.  Why are you just saying today, Sandy?  Why not? 
[02:46:00]  Why don't you bang Maurice?  Why don't you bang Maurice?  All right.  No, I'm not going to say I like white men.  I just do.  Sandy Cain.  Usually depends.  Sandy, I'll guess.  Because you like white meat.  White dick.  I like white dick.  Sandy, I'll guess your age, but, you know, I need a look.  You've got to see the taint.  You've got to go over there where Hawke is.  Now, the taint.  No, no, no.  I don't get too close.  The taint is the area between your bush and your ass.  Yeah, you're going to have to bend way down.  It's that little bridge, the land bridge of flesh between your pussy and your butt. 
[02:46:30]  A taint pussy and a taint butt.  It just taints.  All right.  Okay, so I have to, like, lift my leg?  Oh, that thing looks like a tumor.  People used to pay for that for me.  They still do.  No, you've got to kind of bend over from the rear and show Opie.  Wait, you're still making money off your body?  Did I just hear that?  Well, you know, I'm still, I mean, I don't do anything else.  On television, I'm on television, public access, channel 34, 110 RCN. 
[02:47:00]  I got a million.  And your warts on what, 35?  What?  Nothing.  That's a good line.  That was pretty good.  My what?  That was a good line.  My twat?  No.  Cancer breathing wart.  Oh, my wart.  You're on 34.  I never show it.  Only here.  I always cover it.  Did you see it, Rich?  I saw it.  It just looks like a brain.  Is it bigger?  It looks like a brain.  I don't remember it being that big.  Yeah.  It's grown.  I think it's grown.  Really?  It's grown.  That wart should be in real.  That's the biggest venereal wart on the planet. 
[02:47:30]  The biggest what?  Venereal wart on the planet.  Venereal.  Venereal wart?  Venereal wart.  Look, I'm puking already.  That's the biggest vira wang I've ever seen.  What's the warts in your ear?  Venereal wart?  Yeah, but I can wash my ear.  Your ear smells like an asshole.  So, anyway.  No, really?  Ooh.  You know, I bet she was sexy in her day.  Go ahead.  Not her.  Wow.  President's wife?  Yeah, push his wife.  All right.  Maybe if I had a face lift.  Sandy, we've got to focus again.  You should do a before and after.  Give me a face lift.  Am I guessing your age or are we going to do a song? 
[02:48:00]  I don't care either way now.  Okay.  The moment is almost past, Anthony.  Really?  Am I guessing your age?  Show them your taint.  Stop talking and show them.  How do I do it?  You have to bend over and pull your panties down.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Now, pull that out of your ass crack.  And now, bend over more.  There you go, Opie.  You've got a view.  Now, spread them a little bit.  Open it.  Move those headphones.  Jesus.  Move the headphones.  He can't see.  I don't have headphones.  No, they're on the console. 
[02:48:30]  There you go.  All right, Opie, take a look.  Sandy, turn more towards...  You've got to bend down a little more.  Point your butt.  I wouldn't do it for anyone but you guys.  There you go.  Well, yeah, you haven't said that before.  Uh-huh.  Hope he's studying.  Dr. Hughes.  He's studying.  Could you spread...  You've got to spread it just a little bit.  Spread a little more, Sandy.  Spread it.  Don't be shy.  Open it.  You're a naughty girl.  Go to the dentist.  Hold him.  God, that's unbelievable.  Wait, can you open it so...  Oh, man. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, open it.  I don't do this on my own show.  I just want to...  All right, all right.  The boss has to see that.  All right.  You got it?  Don't have a great fucking ass.  Let him see.  He doesn't think it's nice.  Open it up for him.  Yeah, that's really nice.  Open it, Sandy.  Here, open it.  Open it for him with both hands.  Yeah, look how nice that is.  Oh, Jesus.  Her ass has a clit.  All right.  I am...  I'm a little confused with this one, Anthony.  I got to tell you.  Yeah, I'm a little confused.  I know.  Isn't it gorgeous?  Well, we usually do this with...  I watch my own show. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know what it means.  I don't know what it means.  A lot younger.  A lot younger.  A lot of hair in there, Oak.  A lot of hair.  Really?  There's a lot of hair in my hair?  Yeah, that's distracting.  Distracting my powers, Anthony.  Well, maybe, listen.  I'll do this show again and shave.  I'm thinking that this year, we're in 05, right?  I think you...  This is a big year for you, age-wise.  I'm not sure if it's past or it's coming up.  But you got a milestone birthday coming up, no?  Oh, really?  Is that true?  Or it just passed.  I don't know.  No, they're all milestones. 
[02:50:00]  But I think it's a big birthday.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you think about it?  I mean, because we always do this within a year, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Because you never know when the actual birthday...  One year, give or take, right?  That's a little rough.  Am I right about a milestone birthday?  Not really, no.  Oh, no.  My powers might fail me today, Anthony.  But maybe she's not going to admit it.  That's true.  Right.  I could lie.  Do you have a license or something that I could compare the age?  Yeah, I have something.  You do?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:50:30]  Where is it?  Oh.  Give...  It's in my pocketbook.  It's in your pocketbook?  Yeah.  You will definitely show after I give the age?  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  Why not?  She's a woman.  She might lie.  Yeah, I'm not a woman.  At this point, it doesn't matter.  Why not?  Who cares how old you are?  You've got bumps growing all over you.  People aren't going to go,  I'm not banging her because she's 82.  Can I see the...  You know?  A lot of young guys want me, baby.  It's like fucking you.  It's like reading Braille.  Can I see the front again? 
[02:51:00]  The front?  Yeah.  Sean Antoineau.  I can't look at that.  No, the other side.  I don't need to see that because that's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think...  Just tape and rip.  Oh.  All right.  I'm going to guess...  I think that you're turning, or have turned, the big 6-0.  60.  60.  Is he right?  No?  Why are you giving us that look? 
[02:51:30]  Like I nailed it.  No.  No, you didn't nail it.  No.  Yeah, you didn't.  No?  No.  Look at her.  She's giving me a look like you son of a bitch.  No.  Am I?  No, I'm not.  All right.  Well, how could you prove it?  I have ID.  No, I have ID.  Yeah.  Can we see your ID?  All I can say is I have never seen a 60-year-old body like this.  No.  They're usually better.  But, yeah, I have my... 
[02:52:00]  I don't know.  Where's my car?  I think you're going to be 60 years old.  No?  No.  I think you look younger, but I'm just going from the area.  That's how I do this thing.  The area?  This is the best part.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Not really.  Well, anyway.  You don't think so much better than my face?  Show me ID.  Yeah, show me ID.  Big deal.  But I'm not.  You know, I'm not.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  It's like what the cops have to do.  Show me ID.  No, but now I don't have it.  No, do you want to see my ID?  Yeah.  That's in the other room.  All right.  Can someone bring it? 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  In that voice, can you just say, oh, you're a cantaloupe?  Oh, you're a cantaloupe.  Yeah.  Spoils everything.  Did you bang Phil Spector?  Yeah.  Really?  Live to tell the tale.  Yeah.  Well, I remember when we were off that you made the New York Post.  It was a big deal.  You're in the...  Yeah, New York Daily News.  She's...  Oh, Daily News.  No, she's part of the investigation, the murder investigation.  Really?  Yeah.  Phil Spector...  P.A. Sortino and all the cops out there.  Why would you be part of the investigation?  Fucking cops. 
[02:53:00]  Because he raped me at gunpoint.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  How interesting.  I mean, I'm so sorry to forget it.  That was horrific.  Why didn't you just show him that war?  That was horrific.  Well, you know, I don't think I had it in those days.  Phil Spector allegedly raped you at gunpoint?  Yeah.  So, how did that happen?  Tell us the story.  Well, I was working at the improv as a singer.  You hated your comedy that much?  No, I wasn't a comic.  I was a singer.  Singer.  Okay, so you were a singer.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Singer and I played guitar and I wrote original songs.  What year are we looking at?  What year was this, Sandy?  What?  Oh, that was...  Oh, my God, Ant.  I nailed it.  Did you?  Hold on.  Shh.  So, why are you lying, Sandy?  Sandy, I nailed it.  You've got to give me props.  And you say right on your form here, date of birth, birth, and age.  Well, here's the problem.  She gives her age as 49.  Uh-huh.  49? 
[02:54:00]  Sandy.  49?  You've got to shoot a little higher than that.  Well, Jack Benny said 39.  49?  I wouldn't have believed that 11 years ago.  All women give the fake age with the 9.  Right.  Girls in their...  No, most everyone's 33.  Girls in their early to mid-30s will always say 29.  Yeah.  Right.  But, so she gives her age as 49, but she gives her date of birth as...  Can I give you a date of birth as?  Sure.  September 16th, 1945. 
[02:54:30]  45.  I nailed it.  1945 isn't 60 years old.  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  Sandy, you've been lying so long that you don't even know how old you are.  Oh, 45.  No, that was...  Hey, look at my ID.  Well, then the ID says 916...  I made a mistake.  1952.  Right.  52?  Yeah.  But you made a mistake?  No, you're kidding.  There are three different dates on this thing. 
[02:55:00]  No, I made a mistake.  There's no way she's five years older than me.  I'm going to be 48.  Wow.  So she's got to be in your 80s.  No, I'm kidding.  Hey, I have ID, man.  It's a New York ID.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but they asked for date of birth and you wrote down...  I made a fucking mistake.  On your age?  Who makes a mistake on when they were born?  I said 49.  Okay, huh?  I said 49.  I don't know.  I think I'm going to...  How do you make a mistake and write 1945 down as a date that you... 
[02:55:30]  Because I wrote 49, too, and that was a lie, right?  So how old are you, Bill?  How old are you?  You read the ID, right?  Well, how old are you?  If it's younger than 60, I'd be yelling and screaming that I'm younger than 60 and give  the age.  So what's the age?  It's 1952.  So you're 53 years old.  53.  That's what she's saying.  I'm 52.  You're not 52.  You're 60.  You're 59.  And it bothers you.  It's okay.  You look great. 
[02:56:00]  You look great for 60.  I mean...  Stop.  I'm just saying, man.  Did you read the ID?  That's a New York ID.  How did I get an ID?  How did I get an ID?  How did I get an ID?  Government ID.  Hold on.  Where's Steve?  That's a weird ID.  That's one of those IDs you get in Times Square.  That's the type of ID you can buy on 8th Avenue.  No, you can't.  It's a government ID, man.  Check it.  Usually, like, 19 or 20-year-olds get IDs like that.  Not a 60-year-old woman.  That is a government ID.  Steve, what kind of ID was that? 
[02:56:30]  It's a government ID?  New York government ID?  It's some kind of New York state ID, but you can get fake ones of those anywhere.  Bullshit, man.  Bullshit.  You got...  Man.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Hoo-ha.  Ooh.  Hoo-ha.  But, you know, I mean, you can believe what you want to believe.  It's okay, Sandy.  You look great for your age.  Stop.  Thank you, man.  You really do.  We're not trying to trash you.  You're good for 60.  Look at this ID.  What does it say on it?  New York state benefit identification card.  Oh.  Identify.  That is a real ID, man. 
[02:57:00]  Is that for...  Food stamps.  Oh, food stamps?  Yeah.  You don't get food stamps.  I do so, man.  What kind of shoes?  How do you think I live?  We thought you lived off your body.  Well, I do, too.  Food stamps.  There's a little bit here, a little bit there.  I need roaches.  Food stamps?  Definitely.  You have roaches?  Definitely.  Rats?  Do you have rats?  Rats, definitely.  You don't have rats.  No, not yet.  I feel roaches.  Why don't you come up?  Maybe I will.  Never happen.  You do have roaches, though.  There are a few roaches in my apartment.  Yeah.  Do you have, like... 
[02:57:30]  Doesn't everyone have roaches?  Do you have, like, a red control apartment from, like, 1920 or something?  No, I live in the best building in New York, 400 West 43rd Street.  It's the entertainment building.  What?  Where?  400 West 43rd Street.  What is the apartment?  Right down there.  Right down there.  For you guys out there.  No, I live on 43rd and 9th.  No, they did a crib segment up in my apartment, remember?  Yeah, yeah, roaches.  Oh, right.  When Pam Anderson and Kid Rock were on that day.  That was a lot of fun.  It was roach-infested, your apartment.  Wasn't that...  Yeah, it was pretty roach-infested. 
[02:58:00]  Okay.  How can you live like that?  How can they live like that?  Well, I try to, you know, kill as many as possible, but how can they live like...  It's a mess, your apartment, right?  No, it's not.  Okay.  It depends.  Yeah, you're a little boxy room.  I know you moved since then.  But you had a stupid little room.  Well, Sandy, why don't we get to some songs?  Okay.  So, you're going to sing karaoke?  Yeah.  All right.  Do we have your track?  You saw the ad.  You saw the ad.  I saw the ad all over the walls of New York, and I was so inspired. 
[02:58:30]  Okay.  And I'm so happy.  The ad that we're back doing radio.  I am so happy you're back, man.  So are we.  This is so therapeutic.  Oh, God.  I can curse, man.  No.  You know, Anthony, you've always inspired me to say shut up a lot, and I just...  Oh, well, that's what I usually say to you.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I mean, just because I was on public access.  Well, now, you're a big star.  We all know that.  Does the wart sing back up? 
[02:59:00]  Shouldn't a frog be sitting on this?  This is like a...  Are we?  You're not so hot yourself, man.  Yeah, but he knows it.  Well, look at you, baby.  You're not the hottest looking guy in the fucking world.  I am.  I mean, you're not an opus.  I mean, come on.  But I'm hot.  Well, yeah, where?  You have hot girlfriends.  I know that.  You have a big dick in there, but...  Do you?  Are you well and down?  It's pretty nice.  It is nice?  Well, you've seen it.  I like to compliment Norton's car. 
[02:59:30]  I'm Norton's cox publicist.  Do you have a big dick?  It's not big.  It's okay.  Okay.  I should guess your penis sizes.  All right.  No matter what in front of you, it's going to look like radiation was thrown on us.  You should get this story.  All I saw was Motley Crue helps search for missing fan.  I have no idea what that's all about, Eric.  Jump on that story for tomorrow.  I guess one of Motley Crue's fans are missing, and the band is helping.  Maybe they thought it was hiding in one of fucking Tommy Lee's condoms. 
[03:00:00]  Look at this...  Check Tommy Lee's pool.  Look at his nose job.  That guy has a nose job.  God damn it.  That was a joke.  I go for the dick joke, and you go for the news story.

[03:17:00]  Rich Boston Studio.  You promoting anything, Rich?  Nah.  Nah?  I'm in McCurdy's in Sarasota this week, then the Palms next Saturday in Vegas.  All right.  I also want to thank Santa Cain for stopping by.  Pretty good first appearance on the new radio show. 
[03:17:30]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We got the gang from FHM.  They're setting up.  Yeah, what the hay?  I don't know, but they look very, very serious.  I haven't seen one smile on their faces in the last half hour.  They're all disgusted.  And now they're all just staring at us.  Setting up a bunch of lights.  They're like, why do we have to do this?  We don't want any part of this, but they told us to go over there and film these idiots.  Is this going to be video?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I guess we're video.  I think we're doing a little something for the sales staff for FHM, right? 
[03:18:00]  We love FHM.  Yeah, we've been in the magazine a bunch of times, and I think it would be very smart of FHM to get us in the magazine every month.  Absolutely.  Give us a little feature.  Sure.  We can make them giggle.  Humorous anecdote.  Joe P. and Anthony Corner.  Well, that's a very good name.  We might take that.  P. and Anthony Corner.  Ooh.  Corner of the page.  Advice from O&A.  Q&A with O&A.  Dear O&A. 
[03:18:30]  Wow, this is not too awkward.  It's going to be nice having him sit there.  They're just staring at us.  While we're doing the show.  Wait, could you, could you, could that thing...  Yeah, you should, over there you can plug it in.  Yeah, because that's not...  The other thing.  Right.  But that...  If you take that, you can, over there.  There was the, uh, the other...  Oh, no.  But then there's...  They all look concerned.  I know.  Like we're actually saying something.  All right.  It looks like Kilroy.  Well, can we get the coolers out of the studio until we're ready for it?  Coolers. 
[03:19:00]  Get some lighting.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  That's good.  Right in your, uh, right in your mug.  Yeah, this is just like taping for HBO.  Hey, where's Ricky?  Yeah, bring Ricky in.  How are they going to capture all of us for us?  Us.  That's us shit, boss.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, look at that.  All right, Ricky's in studio.  We need the rest of the gang that knows a little bit about this Ricky thing, okay? 
[03:19:30]  Wow, this is going to be one crowded studio.  Yeah, well, they could wait outside the studio until we're ready for them, no?  Well, those guys are setting up, though, right?  Okay, whatever.  That's fine.  Maybe we'll just do the taping live on the show for everybody.  Why not?  Ricky's in studio.  Ricky, the intern, who looks really hungover.  Hold on, Ricky.  Wait, Ricky got it on.  Hold on.  All right, Ricky.  Ricky looks very hungover, and you don't have that awful mustache anymore.  No, apparently not.  What happened?  Um, uh, after the Norton show, I went to a bar, uh, drank, like, one drink. 
[03:20:00]  I got a little, uh, twisted.  You drank one drink?  Yeah.  Twisty that I am, yeah.  What did you drink?  Um, what the hell did I drink?  You was just cocktail?  No.  No, um, Alabama Slammer, that's what I drank.  Wait, so you had a shot?  No, it was just, like, a glass, um.  Okay.  That's one big drink, then.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of alcohol in those, uh, Alabama Slammers.  She got a little tipsy.  Thank God you're, um, you know, 21. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Um.  Well, we had nothing to do with his alcoholism, trust me.  We don't know what our interns do after, uh, hours.  Right.  So then what happened?  Um, yeah, like, during that time at the bar, uh, Danny decides to, uh, go get, uh, a razor  and some shaving cream and, uh, and, uh, get my mustache shaved off.  Shave off that, uh, that little mustache you had.  Yeah.  How long were you growing that mustache? 
[03:21:00]  I don't even remember.  Four or five years, easily?  Four or five years, no.  No?  No longer than that, maybe.  I thought maybe you had just never shaved since, you know.  No, no, no.  I, I, I get it trimmed up, like, a little thin, but, you know, other than that, I've  only shaved it, like, once.  You had one of those mustaches that you usually see on, like, a 13-year-old boy.  Yeah, it's like when the hair first starts growing in.  Yeah, and they're proud that they could grow hair, so they'd let it go, and it's just,  it's just, uh.  It's a little darker than.  It's wispy and, and not much to it.  Yeah.  So, uh, in the middle of the bar, they shaved your mustache? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Danny?  Yeah, I was just, I was sick of it staring at me when I was trying to enjoy a drink.  It was staring.  Yeah.  It was just, it was just annoying me.  I was looking at it, and I was getting physically, I was just getting angry.  So I went out to, I had to get cigarettes, and I figured I'd pick up a razor blade and  some, uh, some shaving cream and just get the job done.  Did you shave Ricky?  No, I did not.  I just picked up the supplies.  Who shaved?  I'm the enabler.  Uh, uh, donkey sausage.  Donkey sausage.  Big celebrity.  Donkey sausage.  Oh, wow, there's something there. 
[03:22:00]  Danny?  Big celebrity that she is.  What's that about, Danny?  No, I'm not trying, I'm not trying to be rude or anything.  Yes, you are.  Are you kidding me?  You said that line and looked down.  Like, meh, meh.  Meh.  Big celebrity.  She runs around just looking for it, so.  Yeah.  Good for her.  Well, she's like, I think she's becoming like the den mother of, uh, the whole show.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she's sexy.  Anything that, uh, anything that goes on, she seems to be there and seems to take charge. 
[03:22:30]  All right.  And she also kissed you, but I, you weren't really kissing her, bro.  No, it was just like, uh, just, just contact on lips.  That was it.  No making out or nothing like that.  Just, just like.  And how did that get started?  I don't know.  It just happened.  Did she come up to you and just grab you?  Yeah.  Not like that.  And started kissing you?  No, it was just that, she just cut her lips on my lips and then it just stayed like that  and I think two guys took the picture.  Oh, so it was just a photo op more than it was.  Yeah.  Why didn't you, uh, you should have went for tongue.  No.  Like, if she approached you and did that, you could have slipped tongue without any repercussions. 
[03:23:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know either.  All right, so then what happened, Danny?  Then you guys all came back here all drunk?  Uh, well, I was planning on staying in the city anyhow, because I was just going home,  did it make sense?  And, uh, Ricky decided that he was not going to go home either and was going to crash here  at the studio.  You're a wild man.  Yeah, he's crazy.  He's a real rebel.  So, uh, we, uh, so he came back here and, uh, Danny gets pissed off when the other interns  get more mic time than him. 
[03:23:30]  I am so exhausted.  I just want to go home and take a nap.  All right.  Yeah, I hear you.  So, uh, then you guys decide to record him or something?  Yeah, I figured since he was already intoxicated, I might as well make the most of it.  So I just flipped on a mic and I went for it.  Good thinking.  And are you in trouble, uh, at home there, Ricky, for staying here last night?  I'm not sure until I get home.  I mean, I did talk to my mom.  Just, she just called me to see if I was okay and whatever, but I, I don't know how my dad  would feel about it.  So I have to wait until I get home.  About you being out all night?  Yeah.  Just so you went to a sleepover. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  They wouldn't even buy that.  They're just like, my mom was upset that, like, I made the decision to, like, not go home,  which, you know, would have been stupid anyway, because it's like, I'm in the city already.  Why go all the way up north to Yonkers and then come back down in the city?  Do me a favor, Ricky, don't practice your speech to mom on us.  Yeah, right?  That was the mom's speech.  I mean, mom, I didn't think it would make any sense to come on.  You know, it wouldn't make any sense.  I'm in the city already.  It wouldn't make sense for me to go up north.  Hey, getting back to the HBO taping with Ricky.  Host Comic is getting the crowd ready before the taping. 
[03:24:30]  Ask where everyone is from.  When he asks, is there anyone from outside of the tri-state area, Ricky raises his hand.  When asked where he's from, Ricky said Yonkers.  That was you?  Yeah.  I heard that and started laughing, going, who is the idiot that doesn't know Yonkers as part of the tri-state area?  I didn't know he said tri-state area.  I heard him say out of town.  I didn't know.  Tri-state area.  Yeah.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pete.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for me.  Vote for Pedro. 
[03:25:00]  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  If you vote for me, all of your wildest dreams will come true.  You're that guy.  You're that guy.  That's classic.  All right, well, we got some audio of Ricky.  Ricky is drunk and tries to reenact a Norton joke?  Oh, God, yeah.  Danny?  I don't really remember.  I kind of had a lot to drink as well.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the tape.  You had an Alabama slammer and you're drunk? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, I know.  After fucking being drunk from earlier, I'm such a fucking pussy and drinking.  I haven't drank ever and gotten drunk and like now I'm a little drunk.  Oh, drunk?  What did you think of Jimmy's show last night?  Jimmy's show was fucking awesome, man.  He fucking murdered.  It was fucking funny as fuck, man.  What was your favorite part?  Um, the Terry Schiavo and, uh, the, the, the Pat O'Brien part.  That had me fucking almost falling off the seat, man.  It was fucking funny as hell. 
[03:26:00]  Reenact, because a lot of people didn't get a chance to go to that show.  He was starting to tell the joke about Terry Schiavo and everybody was like, oh, and he  was like, what the fuck, you know, there's nothing wrong with talking about Terry Schiavo.  He starts going into it or whatever and fucking, like, he starts like, you know, if I was  the boyfriend, I'd be like, sure, you can go visit her, but then I'd go and fuck her  like every day or something.  I know I'm butchering the line, but it was funny as fuck.  I mean, you have to go see Norton to see that, that fucking act reenacted is fucking 
[03:26:30]  funny.  Like, he's like, you know, if I were the boyfriend, you know, I'd let the families come, come over  and see her, but then I'd have to fuck her.  I love Derek, man.  Derek's the fucking man.  Wow, why the F-word so many times?  Wow, not a whole.  Holy fuck.  Unbelievable.  I have never heard so many F-words in one little conversation like that.  Were you sitting on Otto's lap? 
[03:27:00]  What happened?  You just curse a lot when you get drunk?  Do you curse a lot?  Like, that was my first time getting drunk, so I don't know.  First time getting drunk ever?  Yeah.  You've never had anything to drink before?  I have something to drink, but I've never gotten, like, drunk drunk, you know?  All right, well, we got another clip here.  Ricky explains what happened to his mustache.  Ricky, what happened to your mustache?  Well, you fucking shaved it off. 
[03:27:30]  What happened?  You walked into a bar with a mustache, you left without a mustache.  Yep.  That's it, isn't it?  What happened?  Who shaved you down?  Give us the details.  I don't want to give out names.  There was a lot of whackbaggers in that bar that we walked into.  So whackbagger shaved you down?  Yeah.  Like, well, you buttoned a fucking razor, dick.  And then fucking, like, this chick fucking shaved that mustache off.  Me have, they took pictures of it, I'm fucking getting shaved off or whatever, and it's all done. 
[03:28:00]  Like Pryor.  Like Richard Pryor.  Little intern, Scarface.  They're fucking, fuck their fucking mustache shaving.  You shaved the fucking mustache.  You.  Fuck your pelicans.  Whackbaggers shaved it.  Now, cringe humor's gonna say, but we were shaving mustaches first.  Can't you just post on whackbag and cringe?  Right, bitch?  Why can't you post on both?  Ricky didn't get laid and sucks with girls. 
[03:28:30]  He explains that with this.  Did you get laid tonight, Ricky?  Nah, not at all.  Why not?  Because I stink, I don't know.  Wasn't there girls at the show tonight?  There was a ton of girls, fucking really pretty ass fucking NYU girls just there.  I mean, we were there for the Kevin Brennan show, before the Norton show, and like, there  were some chicks that were sitting in front of us that were just fucking smoking.  They had to be at least not over, not over, like, not even like 20. 
[03:29:00]  They had to be 20 a little bit over, not that much.  They couldn't have been that old.  They were fucking hot, some fucking good-looking white chicks, but I didn't talk to them.  I don't have fucking balls to them.  And even like this dude from like Whackbag Joe, he's like, yeah, fucking, why don't you  just talk to them?  It's like, I don't know.  It's, I don't know.  If you had balls, what would you say to these girls, Ricky?  I don't know.  I guess I don't have balls. 
[03:29:30]  I don't know.  You meet a cute girl.  She goes, hey, aren't you Ricky?  And what do you say?  Hi.  I don't know.  Yes, I am.  Sure.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck else to do.  I mean, it has to be a girl here.  It wouldn't be like, you know, you in the studio right now, you know?  Talking.  Or you're like, not drunk, and I'm fucking, like, drunk.  You have to un-fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck! 
[03:30:00]  God damn it!  Are you fucking with me?  Can I say I'm 36?  That's the worst conversation I've ever heard anybody have about anything.  It is awful!  You are terrible!  And Danny, with the interview, a girl comes up and says, you're Ricky.  What do you say?  What do you say?  Go.  Ricky had one drink.  I had about 12.  I listen to that.  I feel like a scholar.  Wow.  All right.  Here's another clip.  Ricky, I guess you ask if Ricky's jealous of Travis, the young go-getter.  You know what?  This is, in all honesty, this is like the first time me hearing this stuff, because I don't 
[03:30:30]  even remember it last night.  Two drunks just talking to each other after Norton's HBO taping last night.  Are you jealous of Travis?  Do you think that Travis is stealing the spotlight?  And if maybe Travis wasn't in the picture, it could be the Ricky show?  Oh, hell no, dude.  If it was somebody else, they'd still take my thunder, dude.  I'm just like, I don't know.  I mean, Travis is definitely a better intern, in my opinion.  Why?  Well, he actually, like, you know, does more shit than I do. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, he does get the orders right.  He does, you know, more shit.  And then I'm sitting here, you know, doing shit, you know.  I mean, I honestly have to look up to Travis, too, because he's cool.  You know, even though, you know, he'll still look at me as, like, an idiot sometimes, but,  you know, he'll fucking still be cool about it.  I mean, you know, but, no, Travis is cool.  I mean, you know, if it was, yeah, he's cool.  You look up to Travis? 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  I don't even know how to shave, man.  Well, I am just dumbfounded here at this conversation.  Travis is a bad motherfucker.  Yeah, he gets coffee and shit.  I know.  Don't forget the milk.  He comes in the studio and reads a magazine like he doesn't want to be here.  Does the shit, you know, and I don't do the shit, but shit.  This is just awful.  Absolutely awful.  What's going to happen tomorrow when your mom finds out that you got drunk last night  and stayed at the studio?  She won't find it out.  Dude, she's not even mad at me being drunk. 
[03:32:00]  I mean, she's calling me because it's like, all right, come home now.  I'm like, no, it doesn't make any sense for me to get home because I have to do the radio show.  I have to work here at Opie and Anthony in, like, a couple of hours,  and it doesn't make sense for me to go all the way fucking to Yonkers and then come back.  I mean, I'm missing out on a lot of sleep.  And you're turning on the instant replay.  And, I mean, dude, it's like, it doesn't make any sense for me to go all the way home  and fucking going back, you know.  It makes no sense at all.  Ricky.  And, I know, she's, and, dude, she's telling, she's saying to me, 
[03:32:30]  oh, you know, you don't make, you can't make that decision and that bullshit.  And now, like, I have to talk to my dad tomorrow and I know it's going to be fucking hell.  I know my dad's going to flip.  I thought he was going to say my dad's going to fuck me.  I was hoping.  Wow.  How hot would that have been?  You know how uncool it sounds to be using the word fucking and, you know,  and then she fucking said that when you're talking about your mommy.  Yeah, and I told her, you know, it doesn't make any fucking sense for me to go fucking home 
[03:33:00]  when I'm in the fucking city.  Mommy.  How old are you?  I'm 19.  Okay.  And your mom said that it's not for you to make that decision to stay up?  What's your background?  What's your ethnic?  El Salvadorian.  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's just, oh.  As in, oh, that explains everything.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Dumb, dumb.  Well.  All right.  Are you ready for your book report or whatever the year was?  Just kind of a, yeah, report. 
[03:33:30]  A report?  On sarcasm, yeah.  Where is it?  It's in my back pocket after that.  It's like at school.  Yeah, we asked him to do, um.  Fold it up in your back pocket.  What school did you go to?  Uh, Westchester Community College.  Oh, Westchester.  Rich, we, uh, told him to do a little report on sarcasm.  He didn't get sarcasm.  Yeah.  Nathaniel was in our office one day.  Who, by the way, uh, really gets sarcasm.  He gets sarcasm the most out of the interns.  Yeah.  The most.  He was sitting at his desk, and, um, for some reason, 
[03:34:00]  there were a bunch of the chairs in the office were all gathered around him, uh, as people  had just pushed him there, I guess.  And he looked around and went, could I get another chair around me?  And, uh, Ricky grabbed another, the couch.  Yeah.  And was trying to push the couch over there, thinking, perhaps he really did need yet another  seat around him.  Wow.  Yeah.  So he has, oh, that's right, Jimmy wasn't here for that either.  Complete lack of understanding about sarcasm.  Look at Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy, yeah.  Jimmy's holding it in his head.  Yeah, Nathaniel's just like, could I have another chair around me? 
[03:34:30]  And he went to get him another chair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a real ass.  You are a real ass.  So, so we told him, if he's going to work on this show, he really has to understand  sarcasm.  Absolutely.  So we told him to do a little report on sarcasm.  I mean, you're a bright guy.  He looks like ADD.  If you could look at ADD, he just, he's just in another day.  The face of ADD, is that it? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Dude, why don't you have any confidence in yourself?  Did parents beat you up when you were growing up?  Not physically, but just...  Mentally, you mean?  Yeah, something?  Yeah, something.  Yeah.  They wouldn't let you sleep in the hut as a kid back in El Salvador?  No, I never lived there.  I was born here, so, thankfully.  But they both came from there, so...  Both.  Why is that painful, that you were born here?  No, no.  Did you say painfully?  No, thankfully.  Oh, thankfully.  Okay, I'm sorry.  You kind of get a little ghetto every so often, I've noticed. 
[03:35:30]  You try to get a little ghetto, like your voice.  Yeah.  When you're not hanging out with us, with Caucasian people, is there a...  Do you really, like, get into the whole ghetto thing?  I guess so.  Yeah.  You see how I can say both and stuff instead of both?  That's right.  I see you.  You can get him some pussy, and then right when he's finished, have Nurse Rad should come in.  We got, uh...  Yell at him?  Yeah.  I don't want to have to tell your mother, Ricky.  Please don't shave my mustache. 
[03:36:00]  And we give Ricky a lot of credit.  He's in college, and he does his own radio show.  We got...  Are these new clips from your radio show?  I suppose so, yeah.  Yeah?  Okay.  Want to listen to more of Ricky's college radio show, Anthony?  Jimmy?  Oh, absolutely.  Of course.  W-Y-U-K.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Anyway. 
[03:36:30]  What?  What did you...  Anyway, like...  I'm getting, uh, stuff today for, um...  Yeah, they're whispering over there, which...  Anyway.  Anyway, I'm getting...  We're gonna change the subject to, um...  Anyway, my clothing.  Ricky's shoes.  No, not even much.  Well, okay.  I'm coming in today just because I have a job interview.  He looks so nice.  Brady, boy.  He's so beautiful.  I'm getting stuff just because I have chanclas.  He got the pretty hair with the pretty shoes.  The pretty...  His braces are pretty.  He got everything pretty. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But real quick, it's just...  I'm getting crap for it just because, um...  I'm wearing chanclas.  Just because I can't stand...  The Deeders.  Let them know.  Yeah, because I can't...  I can't wear dress shoes all day.  Come on.  It's like...  I'm just wearing sneakers, whatever.  Wearing dresses is, like...  Go, boy.  Ricky, that is captivating.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  It stinks.  You can tell that whole crew is, like, the nerdiest.  He's got, like, the black...  The biggest Uncle Tom probably on campus there, you know.  Makes Kid Africa look like Malcolm X, you know, and some broad... 
[03:37:30]  Three nerds.  Wow.  That shot's my man, Bush Rocker, right there.  That special delivery.  G-Dev, that was a remix, and then I got some Wu-Tang coming up right now.  Old school Wu-Tang to peck your neck on the new sound of Parody 8.  We'd like to welcome to you.  Yeah, he was ghetto right there.  Yeah.  That was your ghetto delivery.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  Put on a good, um...  What do they call that?  Uh, uneducated sound.  Yeah.  I don't want to lead a game without at least saying goodbye. 
[03:38:00]  So I'm a people on the left, but I'm a people on the right screen.  One last time.  It's the new sound of Parody 8.  It's Ricky here.  I don't need any music for the outro today.  It's 11.58.  Got two minutes after my show, but it's basically the end anyway.  I was going to wait for Abby, just so she can plug her show, but I'll do it for her.  She's coming on from 2 to 4 today.  Tune in to her.  She does some great, uh, stuff.  No, she does some great talk-ups.  She does, uh, talks a lot about things, and then she also, um, plays a lot of good music. 
[03:38:30]  So tune in to her, 2 to 4, today.  914-606-6753.  I got the Power Hour coming up next.  And, uh, that's about it for today.  See ya.  I like how you started singing with the song.  Is that an Eminem song you were singing to?  Yeah, that was the end of, uh, Encore.  And I can't believe I even freaking did that.  Good time.  That was good.  Yeah, it was pretty amazing.  If you listen to that show, remember the scene when people were jumping out of the windows  learning the Depression? 
[03:39:00]  That was really, um, horrible.  Really, really bad.  Yeah.  What's next?  Yeah.  Well, we got the report on sarcasm.  Next.  Here's the report on sarcasm.  You play that radio show, and someone says, that was good.  That's the end of the report.  And it basically sums it up.  Now, this guy has no self-esteem whatsoever.  I know, and we're just a shift in the way.  And just reliably so.  I feel bad for him.  Did you ever work, like, for a guy named Perretto or something? 
[03:39:30]  You seem, like, beaten down.  Hey, Mark Perretto.  All right.  Why don't we get this report in, Anthony?  Yeah, let's get this done.  All right.  Let's get this over.  Let's hear.  By the way, this will be your last appearance on our show.  So, make it good.  Go out in a blaze of glory.  Please.  All right.  All right.  Let her rip.  Make believe, you know, you're in a classroom, and you actually have to do an oral report  on sarcasm.  That actually makes it worse, though.  But, okay.  You want to be radio, so you got to...  Yeah.  I mean, this should be no big deal.  You okay there, Ricky? 
[03:40:00]  You look like you're freaking out.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  I'm freaking nervous right now.  Why?  I don't know.  You're doing good.  Now he's saying freaking.  Yeah, because I...  A little potty mouth.  Mom might have heard that.  Yeah.  She doesn't know how to operate an XM radio thing, so...  I'm good, see?  I'm stupid.  All right.  That's nice.  She's castrating and stupid.  Very nice, Rick.  Well, at least we know where you got your stupid part from.  I think he's a good kid.  You know what?  Shut your diplomatic face.  I like the kid.  I think he's a good...  It's hard to smash him.  It really is.  I like him a lot.  It really takes for 19... 
[03:40:30]  You know what?  We're going to go back to my place and talk about your career tonight.  Ooh.  Two men eating scented marmalade.  You only have a minute left?  No.  Three.  Oh, three.  Okay.  Come on.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Sarcasm.  I just wanted to start out this little presentation on the definition on sarcasm, which has two  meanings.  One, a cutting, often ironic remark intended to wound.  Second definition of it, a form of wit that is marked by the use of sarcastic language 
[03:41:00]  and is intended to make its victim the butt of contempt or ridicule.  Hey, this is good.  Yeah.  Like when someone says that's proper to say the key and often.  Oh.  That comes...  What does it mean to you, though?  You're just copying and pasted from a dictionary.  Well, he said to start, he wants to give the definition, and then they'll move on.  Plagiarizing just bucket.  Go ahead.  I just did this a couple of hours ago when I was drunk, so...  Didn't really help out too much.  That's great.  Way to impress Anthony and I and Jimmy. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  We'll give you an assignment, and you'll do it last minute.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Everyone is sarcastic in one way or another just to be funny or just to mess around with  another person.  It all depends on the situation and how it's supposed to be used.  Yeah.  Is this your words?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that's fine.  It sucks.  Let it run.  That's good.  $50,000 isn't anything is one example of sarcasm.  There are some times when sarcasm is used, but you can't really tell. 
[03:42:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  $50,000 isn't anything.  That's an Opie line that made sense.  Yeah, but explain that.  Why is that...  Yeah, I keep going with it.  The example I said before about Opie saying to Jim that $50,000 isn't really anything was  an obvious sarcasm, but there were people that thought that him saying that without a  second thought may not...  Oh.  You can curse.  It's settling.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, you might as well curse.  You need a drink?  No, no, no.  To loosen you up a little bit?  No. 
[03:42:30]  No.  All right, back up a little bit, because you were stuttering through that whole last line.  Yeah.  I'm just noticing some typos and stuff, so...  Why are you shaking?  Look at...  You're shaking.  Put your hand out.  Just calm down.  Put your hand out straight in front of you like this.  Wow.  Yeah.  You're shaking.  It's not like you're on a really popular radio show that the whole country's listening to.  Relax.  Just relax.  We're not being fools of ourselves.  There's only four or five people in the room.  Just picture it that way.  Holy crap, dude.  Relax. 
[03:43:00]  People looking from out there, the whole film crew.  Yeah, the film crew.  They don't even care.  They're just trying to get the lights right.  Just calm down a little bit.  Yeah.  I don't know if I even forgot where it was already.  Your hero, Travis.  Come on now.  Snap to it.  Get to this.  Are you...  Oh my God.  They turned the lights off.  They're turning the lights off.  Here comes the Sandman.  Go ahead.  You can do it, man.  Um.  Focus.  Focus.  Come on.  Look in Jimmy's eyes.  Go ahead. 
[03:43:30]  I'm supporting him.  Look, see?  Look in his eyes.  He'll show you the support that you need right now.  Wow.  All right.  We're going to have to do this tomorrow.  Are you in tomorrow?  No, I'm in Friday.  All right.  We'll have to do it Friday because I think the show's ending, like, right this minute.  Rich, thanks for coming by today.  Oh, thank you for having me.  I'm out of here.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  All right. </pre>
