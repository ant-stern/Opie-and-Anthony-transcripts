<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with self-deprecating commentary about a less-than-stellar start.  The hosts then launched into an inside joke about producer Eroc’s assignment to retrieve Larry King clips for a retrospective, teasing him about his apparent deception regarding his prior knowledge of the task.  They then reviewed Louis C.K.’s new FX show, contrasting positive listener responses with negative critical reviews from Mark Perigard (Boston Herald) and David Hinckley (New York critic), and sharing a humorous anecdote about a Louis C.K. promotional video featuring an unexpected pool dip.  Anthony described a sleepless night caused by his partner’s reaction to his loud flatulence, leading to a discussion about sleep habits, alarm clocks, and their reaction to a Life Alert commercial.  A humorous tangent involved their observations of “fat b-roll” footage in local news reports.  Caller Chris discussed eating chili in hot weather, sparking a debate about seasonal comfort food and restaurant menus.  Another caller from Texas was criticized for misinterpreting the show's discussion of Alex Jones.  A lengthy segment then focused on the disproportionate number of Black individuals involved in violent crimes against police officers, featuring a heated debate with caller DJ from Queens on racial stereotypes, learned helplessness, cultural influences, and lack of positive representation in media.  Another caller, Al, shared his experiences growing up in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood, emphasizing personal responsibility.  This discussion continued throughout the segment, marked by frequent profanity and offensive language.

The show continued with further discussion of the disproportionate number of Black individuals involved in violent crimes, transitioning to announcements of upcoming guests Chris Russo and Billy Hayes (*Midnight Express*).  A significant portion was devoted to Led Zeppelin’s alleged plagiarism of songs from artists like Spirit, Jake Holmes, Howling Wolf, Willie Dixon, and Joan Baez, with the hosts playing song clips to highlight the similarities and discussing a lawsuit against the band.  Caller Bob Levy contributed to the Led Zeppelin discussion, as did a caller mimicking "Trucker Bob."  A former Sirius XM employee, Deb, called in to criticize the company’s treatment of her and the perceived hypocrisy regarding guest appearances and the show’s relationship with Sirius XM. This section also contained frequent profanity and sexually suggestive language.  The show briefly touched upon Dolly Parton’s Dollywood and a caller’s annoyance with the repeated Led Zeppelin topic.  An upcoming Jimmy Norton appearance at the Borgata was teased, along with an offensive, humorous fantasy scenario involving Anthony and Norton.  Chris “Mad Dog” Russo then joined to promote his sports talk show host contest, discussing the controversy surrounding it and Eastside Dave’s involvement.  The segment concluded with more Larry King clips, playful banter, and technical difficulties.

The next segment opened with a discussion of John Isner’s record-breaking Wimbledon tennis match.  The hosts then discussed their upcoming vacations and desire for four-day workweeks, referencing Howard Stern.  A caller criticized the show, leading to a debate about co-host Mike’s on-air behavior. A significant portion focused on the hosts’ contest to find a new sports talk show host, mirroring a similar F.I.N. contest, expressing frustration at the apparent copying of their idea. Eastside Dave, a potential contestant, was present in the studio. The hosts detailed the contest rules involving five finalists. The conversation shifted to the World Cup, the US team's loss, and the Jim Joyce/Armando Galarraga “perfect game” umpire call, leading to a discussion of the 1985 George Brett “pine tar incident.”  A substantial portion was dedicated to LeBron James’ free agency, speculating on his potential destinations and analyzing influencing factors.  The final segment included personal updates: Opie discussed the birth of his son, Hudson, and his experiences with fatherhood, contrasting with Anthony’s aversion to children and his unconventional hobbies (karaoke and showcasing his gun collection on YouTube).  The show concluded with further discussion about sports, particularly the hosts’ differing opinions on the New York Giants and upcoming tennis matches.

The show then featured a discussion of John Sterling’s Yankee home run calls, followed by promotion of the Mad Dog Radio sports talk show host contest. Opie received congratulations and gifts for his newborn son. Anthony discussed past relationships, describing his marriage as a “fucking nightmare” in contrast to a positive eight-year relationship.  A humorous anecdote detailed his ex-wife’s failed romantic attempts, which he ignored to play video games.  The main guest, Billy Hayes, author of *Midnight Express*, recounted his experiences smuggling hashish, his imprisonment in Turkey (including a stint in a mental institution), and his eventual escape, detailing inaccuracies and exaggerations in the film and the emotional toll on his family.  He discussed his reconciliation with Turkey and promoted his appearance on *Locked Up Abroad*.

The final segment included a continuation of the Billy Hayes interview, focusing on his release, the media frenzy, his family reunion, his yoga practice, and occasional cannabis use.  The hosts promoted his appearance on *Locked Up Abroad*.  The show also featured a disjointed discussion of Larry King's departure from CNN, O.J. Simpson, Roman Polanski, *Brokeback Mountain*, a call from someone claiming to be Layla Ali, a humorous handcuff sound effect leading to a *A Few Good Men* discussion, speculation about a canceled television show host, and an interview with Jimmy promoting his Ozzy Osbourne interview on The Boneyard.  Extensive promotion of Beezid.com concluded the broadcast, featuring humorous skits and endorsements, including a fictional character, "Dr. Steve Brühl," and various winning bids.

[00:05:30]  culture he he even wrote in the review louis uh supposedly does uh some stand-up at a local  comedy club and that's something you could just look up and you you would realize that caroline  uh caroline's and and the cellar are huge comedy clubs in new york city you know you know new york  city the the place you write you you write for so what a dummy yeah you know it's hinkley yeah he used  to i guess he still writes the radio column but it's it's you know it's hinkley but there's nothing

[00:13:30]  with that sound i used this one forever and then i i realized that my whole my alarm was that little  sleep right through that shit see that's all it would take to wake me up but see you didn't have  a mother checking to see if you're still breathing when you were 17 years old no i didn't 17 17 i think  my lungs are working fine at 17 don't have to check to see if i'm breathing no no because now 
[00:14:00]  that i'm a bit older i'm i'm still a light sleeper i think you were because of that past the point of  sidz yeah exactly 17 exactly but uh yeah that that was a huge problem and i finally realized that i was  like you know let me check and see what sound is coming out of my alarm because i'm not hearing  this fucking but doesn't that thing keep going or does it end after a while it'll end it'll end okay  and that that'll just be like music playing sure that's like i have i you know i'll play music in  the background when i go to sleep or i'll have a show on or something like that that'll just blend 
[00:14:30]  into and i'll blend right in and i will not fucking uh yeah do people realize that you sleep with the tv  on and and not at a low volume that's pretty loud that's pretty strange i'm thinking but i don't think  that is uh normal no a lot i'm sure you think a lot of people yeah i think a lot of people sleep with  the tv on god i can't do that i have to have everything like no i don't like complete silence  quiet darkness and shit like that i like the tv the flickering little tv light and stuff and then i 
[00:15:00]  like waking up but every so often you pop one eye open and just go what is that what is that then you  fall back asleep right or you don't sometimes i watched the whole thing on um on uh that uh life  alert thing uh infomercial why because it was just because it was on it's like funny there's this old  bag and and they've actually now it's a registered trademark that they have on there it's it says i've  fallen and i can't get up with the little r in the circle it's like they've taken that as their so

[00:27:00]  on air adult education course that teaches men how to get more tail for less money you never want  to come on after a show that was popular and i understand that and i never wanted to do it i never ever  and it was uh offered to me at one point and i don't want to do it i didn't want to do it  great movie you don't know you're talking about cinematic masterpiece you have no idea what you're  doing if i was a hot chick i'd be the same way it's like i'm not paying for anything for you dude  i'm hot there's a bunch of dudes that can pay stuff for me that's why it's asinine the uh  controlled corporate press claiming that we didn't own guns in the in the colonies and that

[00:28:00]  yeah the typical radio voice and then you just sit there and make believe you're doing like  uh original radio go fuck yourself how fuck you man cow by the way because now i have to deal with  that shit again no one no one offered him howard stern's fucking slot oh no never you  fucking loser net finney i know that club's great was that i know that club's many years old but it  still bothers me because that guy just lied through his teeth half the time he was on the radio liar 
[00:28:30]  fucking idiot everyone knows he's lied we knew all the players and they all came to us and said we  would never hire man cow to take over howard it wasn't even in it wasn't even a thought do you think  turd really drove that car turd turd turd uh turd what are you up to now 60 miles an hour turd there  he goes he's going into a wall and uh the airbags gonna go off you know why imitate it bad sound  actually play it for everybody why would you imitate it utterly bad do you got the turd clip 
[00:29:00]  travis so phony turd oh that's all you got you don't have the long uh form yeah that's all i  have that's all uh that's fine we don't have to go down that road iraq will come in with it and  claim that uh he was just uh going through things and thought you might want this turd  i got into a great twitter uh war last night yeah yeah mine always turn like racist but you know 
[00:29:30]  what do you expect they just do yeah a couple of cops down there in uh florida all right got shot  tampa bay right yeah shot and killed um by a uh they were doing a traffic stop uh the guy had  warrants it was a male and a female in the vehicle uh they were getting the guy and put put their hands  on him i guess to arrest him uh one of the cops actually called for backup and the second one showed  up and this gentleman spins around and shoots both of the cops and and kills them wow kills 
[00:30:00]  both of these cops hops in the car and just leaves his video um i'm not sure if there's dashboard cam  video and none's been released i don't think they would release how did two cops get caught like here  here's what i'm suspecting happened and this is where it turns into a racist argument uh and people call  me racist and everything i'm thinking they saw the two occupants of the vehicle a male and female uh 
[00:30:30]  black couple and instead of thinking for their own safety they were thinking let me not offend these  people by uh profiling them and using certain precautions that i might have to use for a guy that  has warrants out uh because i don't want to lose my fucking job when this asshole uh says that i 
[00:31:00]  treated him unfairly because he's a black man that was my kind of you know uh just my thoughts on the  topic because of what's happened of late and uh so instead of thinking of their safety they're thinking  of treating him like a gentleman with respect and they get uh shot in the face both of them uh for their  troubles um this this this fucking animal behavior has got to stop and then another cop shot in the 
[00:31:30]  back in chester uh pennsylvania which is just a wonderful place uh 75 black uh community over  there uh they are under what amounts to martial law right now for the past week they've been under  martial law there's a curfew enacted everyone's off the streets by nine o'clock because there has been  too many shootings and and murders in this uh town so uh this cop gets shot in the back 
[00:32:00]  and it's just this i i was saying it's this behavior that is unacceptable yet completely accepted no one  wants to call it out that there is such a disproportionate number of black people  pulling this kind of shit and and killing police officers and you know themselves there's plenty  of black on black crime that's why the cops are in these neighborhoods uh and and and i had one guy say 
[00:32:30]  why don't you look at the cause of the problem uh that it's society read a book on  fucking you know social behaviors and stuff i said i just wrote i don't give a fuck what the reason is  at this point we've gone too many years trying to figure out the reasoning there's there's no no  fucking figuring it out anymore root cause arguments by the way whenever someone makes a root cause  argument about anything whether it's about race or about national countries behavior it is always 
[00:33:00]  to vilify the person who is at that moment been victimized by somebody it's always if it's the  u.s they say oh root cause look at the root causes of terrorism it's always to it to to vilify israel  or if it's look at the root causes it's never to go hey look that's shitty behavior it's to vilify  white people are the cops why why is it too that society society has such power um with black people  that it completely uh it completely clears their brain of of right and wrong is that what this guy 
[00:33:30]  was telling me when he when he was saying it's society based it's it's this uh thing that's just  been perpetuated so so what you're saying what he was telling me was black people have no sense of  right and wrong and will just continue shooting police officers and each other because uh they have  no sense of right or wrong and then when i presented with that argument he calls me an idiot and an  asshole meanwhile he was the one that was really bringing that up and then uh another gentleman um 
[00:34:00]  was uh arguing with me uh more race-based stuff and uh their points are just it's like white guilt not  facing the actual problem which you know i could go on here and spout off what i believe the actual  problem is and probably get fucking fired uh because yeah wait till the end of october yeah 
[00:34:30]  because i do have my theories i do have my theories which uh you could probably read in such  uh books like the bell curve and other uh publications um so i do have my ideas as to why this happens  but you know something do something about get a leader get a fucking strong leader that can unite  your people because your people are broken they're busted they have to be fixed by somebody or 
[00:35:00]  something something has got to change within the community that doesn't involve whitey coming in and  trying to help or doing this because cops are being fucking killed and one guy says he goes well they're  not uh drafted you know they joined the force of their own free will uh so if things like this happen  if they want to be a hero that's their uh problem and i said okay then if they punch a pig in the  fucking face i don't want to hear it and see it on video and watch a cop uh being made to look like a 
[00:35:30]  bad guy because he popped some fucking douchebag cunt in the face on on the news they and all they  showed was the clip of the cop punching uh uh that chick in the face that could have absolutely ended  with that cop dead with a bullet in his face you never would have seen the clip you never would  have seen anything but she didn't but didn't she shove him first and then of course that's why she  apologized she actually yeah of course but i mean the news just pounded it and pounded it and then 
[00:36:00]  the description they gave of these two the male and uh female was not uh they didn't say a black  couple they said they left in uh this kind of vehicle the they gave the color of the vehicle  they they don't they don't they just keep race out of it when it's part of it but it's part of it  in a police description especially to exclude race they they name everything that's changeable  the one thing that is not changeable is race it's like if you're looking for somebody who just shot cops 
[00:36:30]  you should probably narrow it down you can narrow it down a lot by saying what race it is gender  and race are two things right height something you can't fuck you can't change you're six eight  you can change that color though yeah yeah you cannot change height or race or gender yeah and they  just uh uh don't understand because it's not the police report the police will always say sure black  male black female whatever uh but when the news gets a hold of that they leave it out  i i don't know why uh listen you got dj in queens a black guy all right dj what's up brother thanks 
[00:37:00]  for the intro wow well you know what the only reason i say that is because it's important to the  discussion when we're just uh shooting the shit it doesn't matter that's all i'm sorry i think people  could figure it out well listen uh jesus anthony an avid listener to your program yes yes sir and uh  uh it's hard to listen to be honest with you because it seems to be a quite a bit of uh i think  of factual statistics no no no all right don't don't try to peg me okay i don't that's that's one 
[00:37:30]  thing yeah it seems like you have a habit of saying black this black that yep and i try to deracialize  some of this stuff all right it's more about being it's more about behavior how do you deracialize  uh great word by the way deracialize how do you do that um when these cops are constantly being  shot by black males during traffic stops uh interrupting burglaries um uh serving warrants 
[00:38:00]  how do i deracialize that when all i'm seeing is that wait why why can't you i mean when you talk  about you you can't talk about the behavior the behavior has to be inextricably inextricably  connected to the color of person there's it's not the color of skin skin color has nothing to do  with you constantly bring it up skin skin color has nothing to do with it it's a  fucking cultural problem there is a problem in the culture that is allowing a disproportionate 
[00:38:30]  amount of black people involved in violent crime it has nothing to do with skin color indians like i  said there are some indians from india that are blacker than than uh african americans the skin  color has nothing to do with it i'm spitting anthony's all out sir anthony actually drooled as he said that  i was spitting flew out of his mouth it's like i'm watching a man unravel completely can i clue you in 
[00:39:00]  this yes sure thing a lot of it has to do with i am i in my estimation some some whites not being  able to discern between different types of black people that's the part i am afflicted with the same  thing you're talking about so you and i are on the same page on a lot of this stuff okay what i do not  like is when uh someone may look at me and try to pay me in a certain way think think that i am of a  certain political persuasion that i listen to a certain type of music you're talking about okay 
[00:39:30]  culture now let's really get into this yeah you're talking about a culture now that is being uh  commodified all right what does that what does that mean i don't know what that means it means  it means the culture is made into has been made into a commodity okay you're talking about a culture  of failure that's being sold on our throats like your like your channel is lovely right but uh  you have 20 different rock stations why not have a black rock station because black rock is on  there where's earl you have to start seeing different images of black people so you can  discern between them because i don't want to be caught up with the nonsense that you're talking 
[00:40:00]  about because it exists well then you should be so fucking angry about the fact that that every time  you turn the news on and see a suspect um you can completely peg what race the suspect is based on the  crime and 99 of the time be right you're you're ascribing to tribalism and i see and i see that  the the reverse of it all the time from a white perspective when you talk about for instance  uh you talked about obama this is somewhat of a tangible related when you talk about obama like 
[00:40:30]  well look at how many black people 90 of the black folks voted for obama and that kind of thing  well you had 43 other presidents that were white that were voted for white people white people are  able to to uh for instance if obama was able to to um have a a uh a black a black vice president that  would have been an issue for for white people but white people can choose white vice presidents all  day long there's no thought about it so you need to start inverting some of the some of what you're 
[00:41:00]  saying well here here's here's here's the issue i had with black people voting for obama  was the fact that he was black it was not based on anything but race it wasn't based on his  platform a lot of them they i saw interviews they didn't even know what his platform was  they were just happy to have a black guy in there as president no no no yeah yeah you've had other  black folks that voted for that were also running in the past and they didn't get that kind of that  kind of thing he was the the right black person that black people felt comfortable with and also 
[00:41:30]  any black person running for any black person running for president under a serious ticket not you  know when when jesse jackson was trying to run i mean a serious he was a serious uh uh the democratic  ticket picked him up not an independent um you would have gotten the black vote because of race just  based on race but black folks vote like would 90 democratic anyway yeah i know i understand okay  listen i'm a conservative but they were dragging people they were they were dragging people in to vote 
[00:42:00]  that had never voted before that only voted because he was black well why don't you explain  this for the for the other 43 presidents where whites have voted for other white people because  that's been the only viable could not even choose a black or a brown running mate because it would  have been offensive it was the only viable ticket other side you don't see on the other side that it's  normal for you but there are only white people running we don't think of it as race i wasn't voting  for president i wasn't voting for presidents based on the fact that oh he's white let me uh vote for 
[00:42:30]  him and they were they were only white candidates yeah i have to think that we don't have to think  that way you don't have to think that way so you thought you think about the world as if it is  if there's equal as if there's ultimate parity you don't have to think that way either how about  assimilating to the whole country and being an american and taking this whole have to embrace  a fucking culture and throwing it out the fucking window how about you just assimilate to  this country and the way this country runs and fucking not shoot cops and not fucking sling 
[00:43:00]  dope and fucking uh not have complete neighborhoods in disarray falling apart where cops are called  constantly and then shot at when they show up how about that shit well listen i'm not here to make  it i'm not here to make excuses i'm not i'm not into victimization i'm not into so don't try to  pin me as if i'm trying to make excuses for people i'm not i just said you based on you know  you all i'm saying is i'm not i'm not some uh victimization uh liberal i'm not saying that dj 
[00:43:30]  you you're sound you're making a very good point you're very intelligent i i understand and i like  this debate it's very good it's not just emotionally based uh well on my part did that raise a good  point about uh ultimate parody though is that how you said it well ultimate parody in other words when  well oh when anthony not open anthony speaks he talks about things as if well there's this black  and white uh it well why is it that black people can call have why do they have bet and this kind  of thing and why is it you know why is it black entertainment television white entertainment i never 
[00:44:00]  really get on that whole thing to tell you the truth i don't you don't have to call it white  entertainment television because you have cbs for that you have nbc for that you have the senate for  that you're not talking you're talking that the world has has has always been based on on this  parody there's no such thing as parody you don't think there are other minorities in this country  that have assimilated to society and are productive members of society and not uh um a disproportionate  amount of burden on on our society there is a i'm not saying everybody here i'm saying it's a 
[00:44:30]  disproportionate amount of violent crime in the black community it shouldn't be there okay i'm not  disputing it i'm not see i'm not one of these guys make excuses you are right but you are talking  about a disproportionate amount of crime that is correct all i'm saying is that some of this will  be ameliorated if you were if you would stop having a a culture that's being thrown down our throats  when you're talking about the rap music all this stuff is is causing a certain type of uh of malaise 
[00:45:00]  or it's exacerbating it and and there is a corporatized thing going on because i deal with this  when you go to a bookstore when you when you want to see if you go to the black section you know  everything now is like it has like a ghetto theme to it now yeah yeah but really you're talking about  but you're really talking about uh see if you if you were able to see like okay in your in your world  i'm gonna put it this way you see all these different types of depictions as normal in my world 
[00:45:30]  i'm seeing a ghettoized thing that's supposed to that's supposed to define me so you get annoyed like  you get annoyed you mentioned black rock like you get annoyed like there's a black guy that  that like people look at you and don't don't automatically think like hey maybe this guy  likes rock music or maybe this guy likes other things they'd look at you and think he likes this  music and that's it and that's who he is well i'll give you an example uh i was looking at one of my  friends right he's an officer by the way police officer and i went to this place to get a radio fixed  and i don't think i look any you know i i'm very conscious of my appearance because i think that way 
[00:46:00]  and uh the salesperson comes to me and he goes to this whole thing what's up my brother you know  my friend says to me listen doesn't he know you have like two degrees i said i said you know and  i said what i'm not going to jump down into this guy's throat i just let it pass so i said just on  sight he he didn't think i spoke the king's english i don't know what was going on that's just that's  like a bad sitcom scene yeah yeah exactly unbelievable let me tell you i'm not one of these guys i'm 
[00:46:30]  i'm always talking about this this thing that's that's being pushed on our throats as a as a  collective as a how we're supposed to act and think and i think i think so again some of this would be  would be uh shunted if you start to see different depictions people doing different things where okay  this guy's doing this this guy's doing so it's normal because now again because i do a little bit of  radio myself on the internet that's a separate thing because i'm trying to make it where people say okay 
[00:47:00]  this guy's talking a little differently where can people where can people check your show out  it's called afro nerd radio and for what for a purpose afronordradio.com and we talk about  conservative politics that black folks were conservative by and large many years ago and  there's a certain way we're supposed to think and now the culture and the corporate culture  also buys into that if i go to a story say well you guys don't you know you guys don't listen  on rock a few days ago in brooklyn you had a thing called afropunk it's a big underground uh 
[00:47:30]  black rock thing that has like 40 000 black kids black and brown kids on skateboards  so not the stereotype mtv covered it for like a second that's it okay uh it just gets again you're  not getting multiple depictions so people can say so blacks and whites can say okay wait a minute  he's not who i thought he was so you're saying if if the media showed only like white skateboarders  and surfers and that mentality after x amount of years white people would go we don't all 
[00:48:00]  fucking surf and we don't all skateboard and talk like a bunch of vapid assholes i see what you're  saying i mean i definitely understand again when i go to these stores it's being thrown down i mean i  have i have like problems with other black folks who try to pin me saying well you know why are you  conservative so why not why why can't i be yeah you know it's like you're you have it's like it's  a textbook for black thought i i it's a singular textbook and that's it i understand where you're 
[00:48:30]  coming from with that but i i started this just talking about crime and and that disproportionate  number uh of a violent of violent crime in the black community that is getting it's so out of hand and you  can't mention it it's this fucking it's right in your face yet if you talk about it i'm called a  racist but but it's what i'm seeing what's that i'll give you another clue by the way a lot of black 
[00:49:00]  people are conservative not not in a republican democrat way they vote democrat because that's  that serves blacks a lot better than republicans but uh that most black people go to church they're  very anti-gay marriage and gay they're they're much more conservative than typically liberal well  yeah many of us i mean many of them i think something else you might have thought of yeah  we don't we don't know do we know who the asian leader is do we know who the hispanic leader is 
[00:49:30]  but you sure enough know who but pre-obama you know who the black leader is or leaders whether  yeah jackson or or a reverend sharpton they're president co-president they interchange every  so often yeah but the bottom line is uh oh you're specifically giving given a nobody else has a  leader but we have a leader well these guys step up and all they do is race bait and uh uh only  take on these causes that um are are very racial they never what you need to start and i say you 
[00:50:00]  person the culture has to stop start to allow different voices so you can say okay wait a  minute i didn't think of it wait see when i when i i challenge black folks on on black radio all the  time and you know what if they say that light bulb goes on it's oh wait i didn't think of it that way  because you're not going to hear from me you're not going to hear my perspective you hear somebody  else some monosyllabic uh syllabic uh black person who can barely enunciate a word or something 
[00:50:30]  and get into this whole democratic diatribe they will never allow even on black  they will not allow me to speak this way so you need to start allowing people not not letting uh  jesse jackson let him because the impression is he's the singular voice for 30 million black people  that's ludicrous you start showing different voices different political persuasions some of this  some of it will ameliorate right now you're not getting you know what you know what you know what 
[00:51:00]  those people are called though they're called uncle toms in the media uh by other black leaders like  revernell and and uh jesse jackson if anybody um you you get a black republican and um they show him on  the news uh speaking and of course he's an uncle tom he's fucking kowtowing to the man all that  bullshit because uh the black community doesn't want to see that there doesn't want to be this there  there doesn't want to be this uniting with the rest of the country there's uh there is such a 
[00:51:30]  separatism between whites and blacks as they try to make it seem with commercials and tv shows that  we're all hanging out at barbecues together and having a great old time and meanwhile it's such  uh separatism but again that can't be spoken about and it can't really be shown wait you and your  asian and black friend don't reach in and fight for the last glass of sunny delight no that's how  it is in my home and then when we don't have it the ethnic kids beat my mother over the head with 
[00:52:00]  the toaster so we're the sunny d bitch uh yes dj uh wrap up please okay just quickly when you talk  about uh well you know you might be called uncle tom whatever that's a very easy argument to dispel  because i'm i'm just quick to say wait a minute you are you're saying that uh snoop dogg or a  crip or any of these other black folks that they don't that their imagery that their minstrel type  imagery energy i'm sorry uh imagery does it uh come off as a as a uncle tom image i'm the uncle tom 
[00:52:30]  because i'm or dr cosby who brought up some of this stuff he's an uncle tom but the people who  actually who actually uh are responsible for behavior they get a pass i think imus a pass you can't  give i you can't talk about imus doing his thing for uh whatever he did when he talked about the  the uh rutgers players yeah but they give snoop dog and his crew a 20-year pass for what they said  about black women well yeah exactly yeah i know that's that's part of the argument too say that i 
[00:53:00]  i understand like don't get me wrong dj i understand your side of this argument i really do but it just  comes back again to what i initially was talking about with the with crime i have no problem if uh you  you know people want to walk down the street with their ass hanging out i like they brought that up  it's like all right you do but that's your you take up that cause you do that my issue is  fucking rampant crime rampant crime uh in the black community it it's it's beyond me i don't know why 
[00:53:30]  people don't talk about it more why people don't talk about how racially based it is what where it  comes from i don't want to hear social fucking ills that that cause it uh i just want a solution  all i have to say is that stop selling us failure some of it would some of it would would diminish  it doesn't help that you see uh that the rap music uh buried it in the ground uh every the the uh 
[00:54:00]  the media buried in the ground you're talking about so failure being sold so there's no there's no  concept when when that's sold to somebody it completely negates i said negate it completely  negates the uh right and wrong in your in in your mind like not you i'm saying in in uh a criminal's  mind it just that shit goes out the window no no no listen i i i agree with you that i'm not going to 
[00:54:30]  try to make excuses for the disproportionate crime and what's going on i will say this i say that it  it afflicts uh people of color more so than white folks because uh i think you would you would see  more of this stuff going on uh more of an outcry if whites were afflicted by it more would you make  it seem as if you personally are being afflicted by this stuff i'm i have to you know something let  me tell you something by it i am i'm affected and afflicted by this through other not not the same  way you are uh but in other ways i am they're they're you might find a financial burden um uh 
[00:55:00]  i have friends that are police officers that you know uh you're constantly worrying about uh uh  problems i have friends of the cops too and they tell me the same thing it is an issue it is a  disproportionate problem uh you're talking about a segment of the black community you're not talking  about the black community in its entirety no and i'm talking but i'm talking about a disproportionate 
[00:55:30]  a disproportionately large uh number uh based on population it just doesn't figure  again some of this might diminish if you stop selling that image right now you're talking about  an image that just it just keeps on selling it who's selling it is selling it there's no way to get  around that they're selling you the pants that that are slung below your waist they're selling  you the music that keeps the music has no positivity in it whatsoever i've never seen it in my life like 
[00:56:00]  this you go to the 70s 60s the music never talked about openly killing people selling drugs it wasn't  doing it what do you think that you're talking it's called programming you have programmers programming  means what it means you know you know about what happened in in uh in germany you thought you're  talking about a sure do media assault that's essentially tantamount to programming propaganda 
[00:56:30]  propaganda makes people uh their minds well this is sounding this is sounding a little conspiracy  based i mean it's it's sounding i'm not like you got from yesterday no no i understand but but is this  is this white people trying to put an image forth that will perpetuate uh crime in the black community  is that is that it how about people get together in these shitty neighborhoods and somehow try to build  something positive there because the second someone tries they're either killed or the place is 
[00:57:00]  fucking ransacked or uh like the empowerment self-empowerment uh in in in a neighborhood  not having uh like harlem they got people were up in arms that white businesses were coming in buying  up these landmarks in harlem building them making them beautiful and and harlem is uh undergoing a  renaissance period but how about black people get in there and fucking do it and then have something to be  proud of and not destroy and shit like that how about how about that one thing your the guy you had 
[00:57:30]  on yesterday alex jones although i couldn't handle him because he made me not want to leave the house  after this guy uh uh he used a term called learned helplessness you guys need to look this up and see  what learned helplessness means learned helplessness has a lot to do a lot to do with what you're talking  about if you literally it defines itself you're teaching people to fail it's really if you don't 
[00:58:00]  see any positive imagery and you're talking about uh again a propagandized paradigm what do you think  is going to happen white folks are able to see positive and negative that the entire spectrum is in  their face and our face is failure well how about uh you know keeping a fan how about keeping a family  together how about not knocking up like 12 different women how about how about like looking inside 
[00:58:30]  your community and realizing there are huge problems that are perpetuating this generation after  generation and and not just music music and stuff it's a lifestyle that that i i seriously would  hope people are intelligent enough to realize this is the problem this is the root cause of it let's fix  it well afi i have a question for you yes in 1950 uh black and white families as far as having a a dual 
[00:59:00]  family uh structure we're on par with each other uh something something happened between let's say  1963 64 to the present where these numbers civil rights movement yeah okay now there's something  there it wasn't always like this you didn't always see this even when we were going through hell going  through segregation all these kind of things but but again you're acting as if this is something that's  always happened you had you had uh even with all the crap we had to deal with you still had uh two 
[00:59:30]  family homes you had a father in the house you had a lot of positivity going on something going on  on now this is why this is why i get into a political thing where i think a lot of it has  to do with uh with being a democratic and lived that liberal mindset and this whole thing as i  mentioned learned helplessness the government is as much as i like obama image-wise i don't  necessarily agree with the politics but we needed to see him there because again you're you have 43  presidents that were white i think i think a lot had to do with uh welfare uh and this uh just just 
[01:00:00]  keeping uh this whole uh weakness and uh welfare state going and i think that had a big uh  problem with it yeah we we i i think we got to take a break yeah where can people hear you again  because you gave me a radio your internet radio show plug you do obviously price the pretty radio  do a good job yeah it's uh afro nerd radio dot oh afro nerd any rd afro nerd  you chuckle on that listen some of us would rather be called another n-word i chose the nerd 
[01:00:30]  that's cool that's all right well thanks for the radio thank you sir thanks a lot dj dj and queens uh  we'll take a break a lot of people want in on this discussion not dude nothing likes the phone  fest i know i know because when you can speak openly and honest about it in an open forum like this  uh people will respond you want you want al real fast yeah might as well al hey how's it going  guys listen what's up i'm gonna be real quick i grew up in brooklyn i'm a black male like from 
[01:01:00]  haitian descent i could have easily been a banger i could have easily did this shit but you know what  my mindset was was gauged a different way when you generalize about the ghetto blacks there's so many  ghetto blacks that don't know the taste of real life that's why they're running around blowing each other  up uh knocking knocking their girls up and not paying any you know child support and doing all  this crazy shit but in the reality of things just take a moment in your life realize who you are and  it's like self-worth knowing who you are and knowing what you can do and just going out and doing it 
[01:01:30]  it's hard to imagine i i'm just going to the basic human root of knowing right from wrong i can't  imagine that even the most hardcore gangbanger whatever the fuck they've been through that got  him there doesn't understand doesn't comprehend that there is consequence that there is right and  wrong when you pull a gun out and shoot a cop in the face most most criminals i'll say this most crooks 
[01:02:00]  don't shoot cops even the mob the the only reason the mob didn't do it was because of the of the heat  it brought they were more organized than say you know some guy on parole or two fucking gangs shooting  it out the mob was because they're typically older people on the mob they were more organized  they had a business sense but if if the if shooting cops would not have brought the heat down and shut  down businesses yeah the mob would have probably killed 50 times the amount of cops they killed but  it was simply a business decision if we kill cops more of them show up there's this knee-jerk emotional 
[01:02:30]  reaction to a a man sitting in a vehicle he has wants and warrants on himself and the cops are going to  bring him in and he makes a conscious decision that i'm not going to let them take me to jail i'm going  to shoot them both in the head and kill them he's got to know that that isn't right yeah i have to  believe at least that i totally agree with you but like i said you're talking about people who have no 
[01:03:00]  self-worth okay the whole fact of the guy shooting the cop in the face because he's going to go back to  jail means that he doesn't believe that his self has any has any worth in this planet you know all  he can do is continue to to welch off the system and you know until he gets locked up again well  then i can't reading cycle it's not it never comes back to focus and reality for these people well  unless something is done within the community not whitey helping or fucking government intervention  or social programs someone's got to wake the fuck up in the black community and really realize that 
[01:03:30]  there's a giant problem that is being perpetuated by generation after generation of the same mistakes  being made over and over again that are just pumping out um a horrible element i can't believe two cops  get caught like even with political correctness and cops have to be polite now and have to do things  to worry about i think that's a problem but two two guys don't usually get caught like that like  making such i understand a glad error right but listen look at it this way you never you never hear like uh 
[01:04:00]  haitian americans or people that have come to come to this country and flourish just like the  italian americans people my my parents came here with nothing they had nothing and they made stuff  and they made sure that i knew that going this route would definitely end me in peril and guess what  i kept my head on straight i could have easily i mean i grew up in brownsville brooklyn i could have  easily been a blood banging with these guys you know like but every day i went to school i kept my head 
[01:04:30]  down kept saying good direction and that's exactly what a lot of people need to do is separate  themselves from that and and that's that's what i want to say also i want it because i get shit for  this all the time i'm not generalizing i'm not saying every black person is uh the example i'm using uh  i'm just i'm just saying there's a disproportionate number and it really needs to be addressed um i i you  know great good for you i'm glad that you were able to uh to get yourself out of that shit um and and 
[01:05:00]  and uh make a life for yourself and i'm sure there are plenty of other people uh black people that  have done the same thing i understand that i just can't deal with this mindset and disproportionate  number where shooting fucking police officers and killing each other over nothing is is it's fine it's got  to be addressed it's got to be addressed right you're absolutely right i love your show jim we'll 
[01:05:30]  try to come check you out the bogata yeah i wasn't going to mention that i was trying to keep that  quiet over the weekend friday saturday i'll be there thank you buddy i i like that al now lives in  connecticut by the way i know he kept he kept it real i got the fuck out of dodge  worked worked his way up and decided to take that shit out of the ghetto  let's start somewhere else dude the show's been on for a fucking hour already yeah i guess so yeah  and and we could keep going trust me the phones are just lit but we'll take a we'll take a break

[01:07:30]  grew up loving zeppelin they've been broken up for how long oh how how could you keep suing this band  well when you know the guys are all living in castles all over the world and yeah and you're  like a guy that never made it and you know that they took one of your songs and made it into a  monster hit who's suing them uh i don't know in this case uh a folk singer jake holmes you know 
[01:08:00]  jake holmes yeah jake holmes had a huge what jake holmes uh yes he wrote giant hit songs  jake jake holmes his hair i bet listen to music not jake holmes his hair it's jake holmes oh  different chip um chip's face he gets so upset with me before you we before we play the new one i  want to play the the biggest ripoff that uh zeppelin had oh yeah these are all short clips don't worry 
[01:08:30]  we're not gonna play the whole fucking thing but in uh 1968 a little band called spirit  ah you know spirit it spirit sure i think they did uh it's what you break on people i think they  did i got a line on you what the fuck i got a line on you got a line on you babe i think blackfoot  covered that one later on spirit song though yeah spirit yeah okay uh my joke popped oh did it damn it 
[01:09:00]  wow i have to listen to the replay oh boy did it bomb doesn't do they have it  okay give me one minute how will you find it there's nothing to indicate it was a joke  oh my god it was a verbal semi-colon holy  shit i gotta hear that yeah ready okay yeah let's hear  here now you you gotta just give me a minute oh poor travis is losing his mind yeah come on 
[01:09:30]  come on travis it's not that hard  it's not it's not any more complicated than that yes dr steve brule  no no  maybe it's taking just a lot longer than than if he figures it out that's fine uh back in 1968 the the  band spirit you got it now i'll grab that figures 
[01:10:00]  ah you know spirit it spirit sure i think they did uh it's what you break on people i think they  did i got a line on you what the fuck yeah you hear it's what you break on people wow  oh that was a monumental fail bomb when you have to go wow actual pain i didn't even get it oh that's 
[01:10:30]  stunk oh deservedly all right so uh the band spirit in 1968 yeah a song named taurus that no one  fucking cared about no radio didn't do anything with this song i um yeah that's all i know about  it i don't even know no one knows anything about it but it sounded like this 
[01:11:00]  yeah  yeah yeah yeah you know zeppelin's biggest song yeah some people would argue the the biggest rock song  of all time stairway yeah it kind of ripped off the riff from spirit yeah listen to it it's the 
[01:11:30]  same fucking thing oh we have a lot of examples of zeppelin kind of doing that right yeah but now  now we got a new one today jake holmes i i don't know shit about jake holmes jake holmes  back in 1967 he had a song called dazed and confused what but wait a minute isn't that a 
[01:12:00]  led zeppelin song it sure is anthony it sure is what the fuck took him so long i know what's wrong with  jake holmes jake holmes come on 1957 you said 1967 67 67 and what year did uh zeppelin uh i believe  1969 all right so he had two years to make it a hit on his own and since he couldn't let zeppelin  decided we can do this and then uh jake decides 43 years later that he's pissed off what did he just 
[01:12:30]  hear the song for the first time now we know why jake holmes never made it in the music industry  he's procrastinating right he just got ears he never had ears before they were a gift he's not  much of a go-getter this jake holmes no if he's waiting 43 years to bring it to everyone's attention  what an idiot but here's the original from uh jake holmes 1967 a piece 
[01:13:00]  dazed and confused  robbie and shoes  i'd just like to know  give me a clue as to where i am at  feel like a mouse and you act like a cat  well all right well lines lyrics suck yeah the lyrics were a little rough a mouse and a cat  that's tell me and of course zeppelin 1969 two years later 
[01:13:30]  fuckin thieves  been dazed and confused for so long it's not true  that used to sound great  won't get a woman never bargained for you  lots of people talking few of them know  the soul of a woman was created below  jesus wow  that was fun to listen to but god most overrated band ever 
[01:14:00]  oh god  i'm dazed and confused  six days ago  god  robbie and shoes  but i'd just like to know  give me a clue as to where i am at  you feel like a mouse and you act like a cat  that's fucking horrible he deserves to just go and fade into obscurity 
[01:14:30]  and a bunch of more cats jump out of your hat  oh  shit  and they point at me and say take that  the guy stinks  lyrics were a little rough  really awful  but uh there was another band that did dazed and confused before zeppelin as well  yeah yeah we go back to a band called uh  i don't even uh  men feppelin  oh wait where are we going oh never mind it's the yard birds thing  oh the yard birds  but the yard birds were sort of connected to zeppelin as a lot of people know so the new yard birds blah blah blah 
[01:15:00]  uh  wow  that is uh  i think the guy's got a case but jesus  is he still alive  waited a little  maybe it's yeah is it  family taking it up  what's going on there  let's say hi to charles in wilmington north carolina charles  hey what's up fellas uh  check out uh  robert johnson you know that old blues singer from uh  1935 i mean  he has uh traveling riverside blues 
[01:15:30]  and like  half of his lyrics unfortunately were uh  like ripped off from uh led zeppelin i mean  yeah robert johnson got  just got spanked by zeppelin man  those guys  robert johnson got ripped off so much by zeppelin  what thieves they were that really  they're very great musicians plant was an amazing singer  but creatively they were  shit  they really were the most overrated band in  fucking  history  god i wish i would have known this  shit in high school having those sabbath zeppelin arguments  they would have been 
[01:16:00]  fucked if they if the internet was uh  around back in the 60s but uh  uh or 70s uh they would have been able to jerk off a lot easier  absolutely zeppelin may have been fucked but my stomach would have had a lot more potato  pan flakes on it  potato pan flakes  what did you just  wait i'm tired what am i supposed to say  potato what potato flakes  flakes  potato pan flakes  he said potato pan flakes  oh pan flakes  i'm tired i'm tired too because i didn't think i'm on that one  little boy uh trucker bob 
[01:16:30]  hey boys what's happening what's up trucker bob  hey man bob he says jake holmes is an on a fan man he heard you guys doing this bit  what a year ago  he decided he had a lawsuit man he owes you  jesus he's in that voice exactly  hey  thank you trucker bob  do you just yell at people all day bob  that's his job  yeah it's bob's screams  by the way dan from yesterday  dan  what an over-educated boo  all right thank you sir 
[01:17:00]  uh do we know anything about jake holmes  is there any info on this guy online  who is this motherfucker  why did he wait so fucking long  just because i got the cd in front of me today uh black waterside  by burt j-a-n-s-c-h  james hush  not many people knew who this uh burt guy was but he had this song  the zeppelin fans already hear it what is this 
[01:17:30]  i don't really recognize that one 
[01:18:00]  huh  i'm not a big fan  black mountainside  oh  zeppelin was a fucking cover band  they were a cover band  for unknown artists  first ballot rock and roll hall of fame  their royalty  they were a fucking cover band  god all you asshole music critics out there  all you asshole fucking music critics and writers  they bought it hook line and sinker 
[01:18:30]  wow  we could go with howling wolf  oh another one  oh there's a million of them  let's hear another one  let's hear another one  are you here when we did this bit  yeah but i don't remember it  i could listen to it all day  i know i really can  these are great  uh travis uh howling wolf killing floor  howling wolf  we have to go to dilette uh for the for for that  who's dilette  yo dilette  isn't it dilette yo  yeah  travis is getting a workout today  motherfucker  we had in the old uh we had in the old system 
[01:19:00]  how about uh  you don't have that  oh okay okay  he's  they trick because howling wolf isn't spelled  nobody cares  uh  nobody cares  nobody cares about your childhood of poor spelling  go ahead  oh shit we might have to hear the whole thing to get to the part that zeppelin ripped off 
[01:19:30]  this is not zeppelin  no  this is like a typical bluesy riff thing  dan it dan it  all right we get it  and  doesn't sound like  kick him in now  i should have quit you  a long time ago  i should have quit you baby  a long time ago 
[01:20:00]  and this sounds like something a black man would sing  yeah  it's kind of bluesy  yeah  it's good  it's a blues song  fuck  this guy just died in obscurity  yeah  probably swollen ankles because his shoes didn't fit properly 
[01:20:30]  sit on a rocking chair with a  fucking bottle of bourbon in his hand  fat ankles  one sock only  he probably had big fat ankles with his awful ashy ankles  his feet look like ham hocks with nuclear waste dumped on him  i stole that line by the way  my  my friend kenny growing up  his brother ron said that about him  and i just remembered it  he's black dude  and his brother ron said  damn man your feet look like ham hocks with nuclear waste on him 
[01:21:00]  and i never forgot that  until  i just remembered it  see  the lemon song i don't know  that one didn't really  that uh not as blatant as some of the others  no  uh bob levy wants in on this discussion  the rev bob levy what's up bob  hey i think we  joe rogan after them  to call them thieves  get them on stage  grab the mic and go 
[01:21:30]  you fucking guys  stole all these songs  yeah  lead men see ya  do they really have gotten a free pass  oh totally  there's some of the song  uh i think it's called  uh babe i'm gonna leave you  was from a female singer  it's exactly like it  really  do we have that one  do you have it  it's unbelievable  yeah i love hearing  i got uh  i don't know why  i love hearing it  you should have it there  no  no i got babe i'm gonna leave you  but it's uh  then uh green day 
[01:22:00]  ripping it off a little bit  and brain stew  and  chicago  yeah yeah yeah  it's basically all the blues singers  in zeppelin's first and second album  that they totally  took from people  fucking thief  i like the  i like that jimmy  just wanted to completely  uh go back in time  and use all this  uh arguing with kids in school  about  black sabbath and zeppelin  but dude i would have the zeppelin sabbath argument  and you can't take anything away from zeppelin 
[01:22:30]  phenomenal voice  and great musicians man  i mean they were just  they were a great band  yeah  but creatively  and artistically  as far as conceptually  they were fucking thieves  they were fuck  there's like every band  it was probably much more acceptable back then  to take a riff  or to take lyrics  like i'm sure sabbath  i'm sure every band  did it on some level  but to this level  is fucking sickening  it's just stealing songs  it's stealing  they stole  their catalog  and they came out 
[01:23:00]  at the same exact time  i think they both came out  in 2009  well bob stay on the phone  i got i got one more  really good one here  okay  baby way down inside  mama you need love  way down inside  honey you need it  that is unbelievable  and then this one  i can't quit you babe  oh i can't quit you babe 
[01:23:30]  oh boy i've got to put you down  for a little while  oh i can't quit you babe  so i'm gonna put you down  let me ask you 
[01:24:00]  that was the great willie dixon  by the way  before  motherfucking willie dixon  yeah motherfucking willie dixon  were they open about it though  because when you listen to old stones  the old stones have  under the boardwalk  i think on one of their first albums  like a lot of times back then  they would just do  bands today will cover songs  are these considered covers  or were they not being open about  getting them from other bands  i just don't know enough  to answer that question  they would know  they were not being open about  it doesn't seem like they were man  it does and and they were  they're huge hit songs  that are known as  led zeppelin songs 
[01:24:30]  there's no way willie nelson  or whatever  that black guy's name  willie dixon  willie nelson  willie nelson  willie nelson  whatever that color guy's was  but there's no way  he actually ever opened  to led zeppelin  any of these bands  because they would be going  what the fuck  you're playing the same song  i just played  right  right  it's totally a rip off  and and they did  um a lot more  and you will find  a lot more on the web  there's probably about  six more songs  that they've taken  uh what's this 
[01:25:00]  joan bias doing  babe i'm gonna leave you  from 1962  oh 1962  oh wow  this is new to me man  yeah  i hate joan bias  i like her  diamonds and rust  is great  oh  that's all this shit  sounds like a laser beam  tell you when i'm gonna leave you  leave you 
[01:25:30]  when all summer time  summer comes a rolling  wow this is a complete rip on them  probably  hold on hold on hold on  yeah this is where it kicks in  zeppelin  all right now go  me  me  baby  baby 
[01:26:00]  baby  baby  i'm gonna leave you  You could have changed it to winter time.  Sure.  You can leave in the winter.  Exactly.  We're named a time, 8.20.  I'm going to leave you in the summer time. 
[01:26:30]  Leave you in the summer time.  This must have made Joan Baez's giant bush just stand up on end.  Yeah, Bob Dylan punked his head out of it.  There you go.  Yeah.  I did not know that was a Joan Baez song.  I had no idea on that one.  That's Led Zeppelin's song.  Wow.  Zeppelin tune.  And I believe there's more.  I believe there's more from the first and second album. 
[01:27:00]  It's ridiculous.  And did you guys, I think A Whole Lotta Love was ripped off, too.  Yeah, I think you're right.  I don't know who from.  Yeah, but I'm pretty sure that that was one of them, too.  Oh, Bobby, Bobby, the original was called A Big Bunch of Love.  It was some band.  A Big Bunch of Love.  A Big Bunch.  Yeah.  Hey, Bobby.  Oh, cunt, I'm going to leave you.  A Whole Lotta Love was one of the examples we had from Willie Nixon.  Willie Dixon.  Willie Nixon. 
[01:27:30]  Willie Nixon.  No.  That was my song.  Led Zeppelin's ripping me off.  Put Liddy on it.  Hey, we got info on Howling Wolf.  Hold on one second.  You're on.  Well, Wayne's got info on Howling Wolf.  Wayne.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Hello.  Howling.  Willie Dixon wrote a lot of songs for Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters, but Willie Dixon successfully  sued Led Zeppelin for a million bucks for that Killing Floor song.  And if you've ever seen Cadillac Records, they get into it on that movie. 
[01:28:00]  Cadillac Records.  All right.  That's something I've got to check out now.  Mm-hmm.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would you give up $50 million for $1 million?  I think I would.  Yeah, no kidding.  I'd kill all those fucking songs and fucking make...  They made a fortune off those fucking songs.  Yeah, a lousy million is all Willie got.  Yeah.  I mean, Howling Wolf, sorry.  He's in a rocking chair in fucking Mississippi going, I got them boys.  Yeah.  As they're living in castles. 
[01:28:30]  Exactly.  But there's so much that they've robbed.  The whole first two albums, and those albums were brilliant.  Like Norton said, how can you argue that with Sabbath?  And those were the two big bands there, and Sabbath was amazing back then.  And they really didn't take anything because it never came out that they did.  And they never got the...  The thing that bothers me is they just never got the critical respect.  And Zeppelin, look, again, should have gotten the credit for their gifts as musicians and a singer,  but creatively, they should have been fucking like, look, they're doing cover songs. 
[01:29:00]  It's like a cover band now.  Interpretations.  Interpretations.  Yes.  Because they didn't go with that mouse and cat fucking lyric.  They didn't get credit, Sabbath, because they were talking about the fucking devil,  and everyone was afraid of them back then.  Yeah.  Working class, darker guys.  Yeah.  You know, but Zeppelin is just fucking...  It's pathetic, but they paid people the money.  Right.  But it wasn't hardly any money from what they made, actually.  Wow.  There you go. 
[01:29:30]  You know?  Yeah.  All right, Bob.  Good for them.  Love you guys.  See you, buddy.  All right, Deb.  Where can people hear you now that you blew up your radio career?  You know what?  I wouldn't say I blew it up, guys.  Dude, it's all jokes.  It's jokes, my friend.  I know.  I'm saying I told the truth.  There's a different set.  You can hear me on the O.B. and Anthony show.  That's true.  That's true.  And you can hear me on Syndicate Radio on Monday and Tuesday nights, where I'm getting 
[01:30:00]  thousands of listeners on internet radio, and I'm making more money than I did at Stern.  So it's great.  They just didn't treat you right over there, huh?  Hey, $100 a week.  I thought it was fair.  What I found interesting, what the hell, we got you on the line.  You had Norton on one of your shows over there, and you were told not to mention Opie and Anthony,  right?  Yeah.  We were told not to have him on after I invited him already.  Right.  And he already tweeted he was going on and saying, you can't have him on there. 
[01:30:30]  I wouldn't have had him on either, though.  Yes.  That was nothing to do with Stern and Opie and Anthony.  That was just my lack of radio talent.  And then, I know he was on the other night, and they weren't allowed, they're not allowed  to mention my name at all on any decision, so Norton would throw from Little Jeb.  I was with this comedian at this black club.  I saw a very big load, and I don't remember his name.  Honestly, they didn't say anything to me like, don't say his name.  They were laughing about it.  Like, when I said that, they won't fire me. 
[01:31:00]  Like, I was teasing Bob, but they weren't being uncomfortable with it, and they didn't  seem uncomfortable with it.  They were like, I had to address it, because you know, you weren't there, but they were  fine with it.  It's just weird that, I don't know, we're all one happy company, right?  It's just strange that shit's still going on, man.  Well, that's what my wife said on the show last night when she talked to Tim.  She goes, isn't it one company?  And he goes, well, it is, but it's not.  You're being naive.  You know what I mean?  And it's just, like, it's ridiculous.  It's one family.  That's the way I took it as. 
[01:31:30]  When you guys came over, everybody was going to fucking just slam fucking regular radio,  put it out of its misery.  And then all of a sudden, I was the bad guy for going over to you guys.  And then they're going, I'll give you a plug back if you don't go on there.  I mean, what is that?  You're stupid.  I wouldn't have burnt that bridge.  Jesus.  What a dummy.  He goes, ah, fuck it.  But I got to be fair, and I got to be honest, too, about what happened. 
[01:32:00]  When I was going to go on Miserable Men that time, I did call Tim.  You know, because I know Tim Saban a long time.  And I'm like, dude, I'm not going to be an asshole on the show.  I mean, I'm not going to avoid Opie and Anthony, but it's not like I'm going on a beard.  And he goes, nah, I know, man.  And we just talked for a little bit.  And he goes, you know what, he's like, I just wish, he's like, hey, look, these are Howard's channels.  And it's like you want to run by a guest like that, just out of respect, just run it by the guy.  He's like, he's never said he had a problem with you coming on.  But then I talked to Tim, and he was like, yeah, you know what, I'm sure it'll be fine. 
[01:32:30]  Come on.  You come on tonight.  We worked out very quickly with the phone call.  I've got to be honest.  He was very amenable on the phone.  Yeah, because I told him, he said, I said, you guys are going to look like fucking assholes if he doesn't come on.  I go, I invited him on already, and he tweeted it.  And then he goes, all right, put him on.  Because once something's Twittered, you can't pull out now.  That's right.  Let me tell you something.  I'd rather burn a bridge with people like that that fuck me.  I don't give a shit.  I'll make a living in this business. 
[01:33:00]  But I am not going to get stabbed in the back every fucking day I go to work.  Ooh.  Fuck that.  Wow.  And you guys know how it feels.  We're more getting fucked in the ass, guys.  Yeah.  A stab in the back will be all right.  That would be nice.  Jizz on the back.  That would be a nice change.  Well, I'm fucking one of you guys in the ass.  Somebody can stab me in the back.  There you go.  All right, Bob.  I love you guys.  See you, buddy.  Thanks.  We'll have you in soon, brother.  See you.  All right.  Bob Levy.  Put Bob Levy on Twitter, I believe.  But Tim, I have to say that because it really wasn't coming from some anti-O&A place. 
[01:33:30]  And I talked to him, and he was.  He was like, no, you know what I like.  It wasn't some shitty place, and he wasn't difficult about it.  It was fine.  It was one phone call.  Dolly Parton looks weird.  Oh, that's why she's wearing a wig, dude.  It looks like a wig.  It's a weird color.  Yeah, it's yellow.  Yellow, green, tinted.  It's like Tweety Bird.  People go to Dollywood.  Well, yeah, man.  25 years of Dollywood.  Pretty smart on her part, right? 
[01:34:00]  Well, yeah.  Starting that up 25 years ago.  Who would have thought you could just. . .  She's an old lady now.  Oh, yeah.  But who the fuck would think. . .  Being held together with all that plastic surgery.  You could just be a country music singer and build a fucking amusement park.  You know what?  And people go there in droves.  They just showed a little bit of Dollywood.  Yeah.  It looks like a horrible place to visit.  Doesn't it just look like an awful place to go?  People just keep coming to Dollywood.  I don't even know what I just saw. 
[01:34:30]  Got to be Rubes.  Rubes.  Dollywood looks awful.  That doesn't look like a fun place.  I'm sure there's a theater there that people can go and see, like, horrible plays and musical acts.  Mike in Florida.  Mike.  Mike.  Good evening.  This show is just silly sometimes.  Let's check that one off.  I got a checklist every morning.  Mike.  Good evening.  Two down. 
[01:35:00]  Exactly.  Yes.  Three.  Hey.  How many times this year are you guys going to hit the subject of Led Zeppelin?  I mean, come on.  We get it.  As many fucking times we want.  Have we talked about it this year?  One time, bro?  We haven't talked about it in a while.  And guess what?  It's got the phones lit.  And we're on Starz 2.  So they haven't heard us talk about it.  Yes.  Maybe if you've heard something before, you're a listener.  That listens a lot.  Maybe you could, you know, just tune out.  Go somewhere else.  There's plenty of entertainment on the platform. 
[01:35:30]  And then come back when we're done talking about it.  Because you know what?  It's not about you, douchebag.  Oh, Mike.  Oh, boy.  That's good.  Well, it is.  I mean, we pay our fees.  That's true.  See, you're not the we.  You're the one.  You're just Mike.  The we part is all the other listeners that haven't heard this.  So you can check out for a little while and come back.  The other we, don't speak for all the listeners.  The other we part can listen and enjoy.  Well, why don't you guys talk about other things like Jimmy Norton at the Borgata? 
[01:36:00]  Ah, seriously.  No.  We're not going to allow that.  Mike, I am not going to allow you to say that Jim Norton will be at the Borgata July 2nd and 3rd.  That's this coming weekend.  Not important.  Not important at all.  Plus he hung up.  Or the fact that I will also be there watching Jim Norton from the blackjack table.  I bet you're fucking, because Anthony's such a high roller.  There might be a guy that's a high roller that wants you.  Go stand in the pit and do your act.  Yes.  I really don't want to.  That's kind of, he's got 60 G's on the table. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, hi, Ant.  It sounds funny about the oil spill.  Just to humiliate me.  Make me tap dance like a faggot in front of the other gamblers.  Just wheel in a television for me.  With a closed circuit of Jimmy's show.  This is how powerful Ant is in the Borgata.  If he wanted me to go into his suite and do my dog shit act, he could have it arranged.  Oh, please do that.  They would make you.  They would make me do it.  Why aren't you doing that then?  Because I love Jimmy.  So?  I'd be embarrassed.  That's why you do it to him.  I wouldn't want to degrade him.  You do it to him because you love him so much.  Get a fucking HD flip rolling and make him do a one man show for just you. 
[01:37:00]  Well, no, I'd walk in the suite, but Ant wouldn't be there.  It would be all black people.  It would be like me and like fucking like 25 young gangbanger thugs because they think  it's fucking Cat Williams, but it's me.  And then Anthony has fucking Keith the Cop film me getting my teeth knocked down.  Yes.  Oh, the YouTube sensation that would be.  Sure would be.  All right.  Another break.  And let's get into some Larry King before Chris Mad Dog Russo.  Larry King.  And some asshole on instant feedback.  Joe, enough. 
[01:37:30]  Call the fucking show.  What's with Joe?  Enough.  What does Joe want?  What do you know, Joe?  Guys, having Mad Dog in to promote his contest.  Make sure you find out about how Francesca copied his exact contest just days after Dog announced  he was doing it on Letterman, Doggy Nose and is pissed.  Make sure you ask about it.  Oh, Joe, sorry.  I thought it was.  Ah, you thought he was mad at us?  I thought you were another guy.  Oh.  I'm heating up.  Oh, you're getting all hot?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry, Joe.  Are you sweating? 
[01:38:00]  Actually, he's giving us really good info that we could go with here.  Fuck, Joe.  I'm sorry.  No, it's another guy saying that Mad Dog's having a contest to find like a sports talk  host.  Yeah.  Sports talk show host, whatever.  And that's the job Eastside Dave interviewed for.  Oh.  So this guy's really pissed that he's now having a contest instead of hiring Eastside Dave.  So call the fucking show and we'll discuss it.  It's hard to believe that Russo wouldn't just hire a man who puts batteries in his hiney  to do the East Coast. 
[01:38:30]  Maybe.  Can't believe he wouldn't just jump on that.  Maybe he's not what Mad Dog's looking for.  I don't know.  We love Eastside Dave.  Of course we do.  We would love to see him land on his feet, but maybe.  Yes.  Or even on his face.  Yeah.  Just land.  I mean, Mad Dog did the right thing and they did, I believe, interview Eastside Dave,  but maybe they've decided that he's not right for the position they got open.  But you don't have to fucking send in instant feedback like 20 times about the same fucking  thing.  Yay.  That will get you a ban, my friend.  Yes. 
[01:39:00]  A ban.  And you don't want that.  All right.  Larry King shit next.  Yes, Larry.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got Chris Russo coming in in a few minutes from Mad Dog Radio.  And then at 9 o'clock, William Billy Hayes in studio. 
[01:39:30]  Or is it just Billy Hayes?  Why is it William Billy Hayes on the prep sheet?  Because his name is Steve thinks he puts more words to better prep sheet.  He gets wordy.  Nothing.  It's probably just Billy Hayes, right?  Steve is the master.  Of?  At putting.  Where's my copy of this?  If I could look.  At putting words that don't really.  Do we have the prep sheet for Billy Hayes? 
[01:40:00]  Maybe I'm writing on it.  What, the one sheet?  No.  The one sheet is a two sheet.  Yes.  He didn't make this up.  I'm killing Steve.  He didn't do this.  No, that's why he didn't realize it was the one sheet.  Because Jim thought he was holding a screenplay.  Yeah.  There's actually a tremendous amount of words on it.  But Steve did not do this, I don't think.  Okay.  Well, what is he all about for the people?  So they stay tuned to Jimmy.  Well, he was the guy from Midnight Express in the early 70s. 
[01:40:30]  He was arrested in Turkey.  And sent to.  That can't be a good.  No, no good.  No.  Oh, no.  And it's commonly known in the movie.  But anyone who hasn't seen the movies, it's a locked up abroad episode about the real  Billy Hayes.  There are differences in his life and in the film.  But it's still the same general story.  And it's.  Yeah, smuggling hash.  Hash.  At a time when they were searching people on planes because terrorism had just started 
[01:41:00]  on planes.  They were searching for bombs.  Bombs.  Hijackers.  And they got the hash that way.  Jesus.  He found his hash.  He had it taped to his body.  But he goes through the story.  It's just a horrible.  If you've seen the movie, it's a very famous movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And there's, they're on a bus going to the plane.  And he said that had never happened before.  And there were armed guards in front of the plane.  And he was like, oh boy.  I like to ask him a lot of stuff about if it really happened or it was just in the movie. 
[01:41:30]  Because in the movie, there's that scene where he's on the bus and everybody's getting  off the bus and he like hunkers down behind one of the seats and he's trying to get some  of the hash off of him.  And a guy just walks up and finds a gun at him and goes, get off, get off the bus.  I know the answer to that, but I won't spoil it.  Oh, you do, do you?  I want to ask him about the lovemaking scene with the guy with the flower.  Yes.  Was that true?  Because I'm not gay, but that gave me a full rod.  I like flowers. 
[01:42:00]  Well, he should be a great interviewer today.  Did he bite out Rifki's tongue?  Oh my God.  I should have watched, but I forgot about Rifki.  I just recently watched it, yeah.  Okay.  We have time to watch it real quick?  For this stupid tape.  Throw it on.  Go ahead.  Well, we're not doing anything else today, right?  Long Island magician sent to prison for videotaping women and girls.  Jesus.  Oh, that's hilarious.  As he came on them, he'd yell, ta-da.  Made his weenie disappear.  What the fuck is this about? 
[01:42:30]  In his modest Long Island home.  Look at his horrible hair.  I know.  That's awful.  Holy shit.  It's like a bird's nest.  Wow.  He, uh, that's not good.  He looks like Harry Shearer.  Wow.  A little bit.  Gotta watch out.  And watch out for Catwoman.  She's robbing banks.  Yeah, Catwoman.  There's a woman with a cat mask.  Robbing, uh...  And she's robbing...  Oh, stores.  Not banks.  Okay.  She's doing this...  Look at the dumb wanted poster.  It's the worst cat mask.  It's horrible looking.  Ever.  Could they ever get a better artist? 
[01:43:00]  It's probably what she looks like.  I think she's a black woman.  Yeah, I saw like a...  They showed her a little fro.  A little fro, but she wears a little cat mask.  That makes it all fun.  Well, Ant, uh, Larry King is retiring after 80 years of broadcasting.  I can't believe it.  80 fucking years.  We've always said he should just stay on and continue, because he's still got it.  Mm-hmm.  He's still got it.  He's still got it, all right.  There's dementia.  He certainly does.  I'm glad Cena has finally seen it our way after all these years. 
[01:43:30]  We've been yelling and screaming that they need to get rid of Larry King forever.  Worse.  It's certainly going to hurt our radio show, not having Larry to kick around.  I know.  He was great for his interviews.  But it's time.  Uh, basically, his ratings fell horribly.  Yeah.  Like, 50% down or something in the past year alone.  Everybody's beating him.  Something like that, right?  Yeah.  So it's time to move on and get someone else in there.  But, uh, Larry's stepping down.  They're not firing him. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  They're keeping him with CNN for projects.  Larry, uh...  What projects?  That means they've got to pay out his contract.  What's he going to do?  Sweep the floors.  Compare notes with June Allison about diapers.  Nobody cares about him.  Just fucking go home, watch your wife fuck some Spaniard.  You dopey cuck.  How important is crepping the bowl?  Ah, let me get that for you.  How important is licking her juices out of his foreskin before he fucks your bottom? 
[01:44:30]  I like downing a garlic with a cream pie.  Ah, Larry.  What an awful treat.  Larry, a cream pie.  Oh, we got Larry King checking in.  Larry!  Oh.  Yes, good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Larry.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mr. King.  Oh.  You guys read it wrong. 
[01:45:00]  I'm retarded.  Oh, you're not retiring.  Oh, retiring and retarded.  Oh, I see.  Oh, Larry.  Oh, Chip, Larry.  Oh, yeah, see, that's just going to ruin the whole Larry King bit.  Of course it will.  Anthony, a little look back.  What do you think?  Yes.  I got all the good ones here in front of me.  Which one do you want to hear?  We got the Motley Crue stuff.  We got the skateboarder stuff.  We got him talking about DNA.  We got Jerry Seinfeld basically telling Larry he's not listening. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, God.  We got the Snoop Dogg rapping with Larry King.  Oh, horribly embarrassing.  I want to start out with the Motley Crue introduction.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay.  Larry interviewed Motley Crue.  I think this is what got us going with Larry.  Yeah, because it made us realize how out of touch Larry had gotten and how silly he sounded  and why Motley Crue was on his show.  Just none of this made sense.  Why were they doing it? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, why were they even doing this Larry King thing?  Well, I want to start with the clip before the famous one.  This is quick.  Nicky, Nicky's not depressed, is he?  You're not the other down, are you, Nick?  You're up.  Hey, Larry, you got to come out and see one of these shows.  Yeah, I got it.  You start in January.  How long are you going to be in L.A.?  No, no, no, February.  You and Tommy are going on tour in January.  That's right.  We had it up.  He's...  Do you understand what a filler question, how long are you going to be in L.A.? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  He had nothing.  How about asking him about cleaning their dicks with tacos?  That's what I want to hear about.  Fucking asshole.  So, did you or did you not give her hepatitis?  Fucking dope.  How long are you going to be in L.A.?  That's what I say to a comic when I bump into him in L.A. that I don't want to see.  So, how long are you in L.A.?  Not a good question if you're on CNN around the world.  That means I have no interest in you whatsoever.  He knew nothing of Motley Crue.  How does Larry King know anything about Motley Crue? 
[01:47:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together.  Their first live get-together in five years.  The Motley Crue are back.  The Motley Crue.  A get-together.  It was called a get-together.  No, that's when Frank Sinatra got together with some of his friends.  Their first get-together.  The Motley Crue. 
[01:47:30]  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  We goof about that, putting a the in front, like, oh, yeah, the internets and things like that.  The Twitter.  He does it.  For real.  The Motley Crue!  Well, as we look back at Larry's great career.  Yes.  Only taking some of the best moments.  Larry doesn't understand DNA.  Ron, do you expect everybody to have their DNAs taken?  Do you expect we'll know truly, because no one knows who the father is. 
[01:48:00]  Howard doesn't know.  You can't know-know until you have a DNA.  Do you think we'll find out, Ron?  We'll find out.  I'm sure it's going to happen at some point.  The DNAs.  The DNAs.  Ladies and gentlemen, the DNAs.  I love DNAs.  It's mayonnaise and mustard put together.  It's wonderful stuff.  What?  Oh, sorry.  I remember Jake Brown. 
[01:48:30]  Jake Brown.  He was the skateboarder.  Oh, the skateboarder.  One of the best questions ever asked.  Before we get to that one, I want to play the first one here.  Yes.  Did you know you were in trouble?  Yeah.  By the time I got to the top of the ramp, I knew I was in big trouble.  How badly were you hurt?  I think there was a lot of adrenaline at first, because I wasn't really that hurt right away.  What's your injuries now?  I got a fractured wrist, a fractured vertebrae, and a bruised liver and lung. 
[01:49:00]  How long have you been skateboarding?  Some crazy whiplash.  About 20 years.  Why?  Oh, it's great fun.  I mean, once I picked up a skateboard, it's all I ever wanted to do.  Why?  Why do you skateboard?  I don't get it.  Yeah, this is the kid that fell, what, like 50, 60 feet?  Yeah, he launched himself on that half pipe and just came down.  Yeah, came down on his fucking head.  On his fucking head. 
[01:49:30]  Why skateboard?  It's stupid.  Get a car.  Do you wish people were born with wheels on their ankles?  Would they get gout?  Fucking dope.  He's an adult.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  Yeah.  How important is the board?  The board's one of the main things.  The board, the shoes, the wheels.  How important is the board?  It all comes into play.  You want to feel comfortable with your entire setup.  How important is the board in skateboarding? 
[01:50:00]  Can you just stand on the wheels?  How important is the board?  Or maybe he meant the state of the audience.  And this is, what, a couple of years back already?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is where we were just saying, what the fuck is he still doing in that scene?  The Motley Crue, I think, goes back to before we were fired.  The Motley Crue.  I think that's like...  2001 or so, right?  I think so. 
[01:50:30]  That's a while ago.  And that's when we first took notice.  Then you got...  I mean, there's so many.  Remember when Larry was talking to Denise Simpson?  Oh.  Nicole's sister, obviously.  Right, the sister.  The one that was murdered.  But he did this.  This confession about how he killed Ron and Nicole, and he worked hard thinking that he  was going to make millions off of it.  And we snatched it right out from under him.  Are you getting any money, Nicole, from this at all? 
[01:51:00]  Denise, no.  I'm not getting a dot.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Your head is still attached.  Oh, yes.  You're not dozing off on Bundy.  Sorry.  It's easy how I could have made that mistake with a gaping slice in your trachea.  Yes.  You're not a Pez dispenser like your sister.  Sorry.  Unbelievable.  Oh, what a faux pas that was.  Oh, that's unforgivable.  No.  A huge bravo to Jerry Seinfeld. 
[01:51:30]  Because he was the only one, I think.  Jerry will call him out.  He was the only one that ever called out Larry King for being just adult.  Here it is.  Finally, this movie.  Well, you made it seem like you did the work.  No, no, but four years.  Gone with the Wind took three.  Did I bother you?  Was I bothering you?  No.  I bothered you a little bit.  Yeah, okay.  Why did it take so long?  They're not very good at this.  The bees are not great.  No, the animation people.  They're not great. 
[01:52:00]  It's hard to make animated movies because they're basically puppet shows.  It's a gigantic, insane puppet show.  And every character has hundreds of controls.  And you have to control them.  And, you know, in comedy, you've got to get the facial expressions just right.  You'll see.  See that look on his face?  Get a shot of that.  We worked it to get that exact look.  That kind of, I'm listening, but I really, I'm thinking about a bagel look that you had.  And they didn't get the shot.  What? 
[01:52:30]  I sense a name dropping about to happen.  You know, I saw Seinfeld one night at the cellar.  And I complimented him on how great it was.  Yeah.  Made fun of Larry King.  And what did he say?  Thank you.  Yeah.  That was the end of our name drop.  Jerry seems very aloof.  No, he was nice about it.  He wasn't a dick.  But he seems very aloof.  He is.  But he's been nice to me.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was it mentioned in that clip that he wasn't listening?  No. 
[01:53:00]  I think the next one is.  Ah.  Because they were talking about, like, the bee, I think.  One of the bees.  Did Iraq mark them wrong?  What do you think?  That was a waste of a clip.  Oh.  What do you think?  I think he did.  I vote yes.  Did you hear at any point you're not listening?  No.  He was talking about facial expression of one of the bees.  I don't even know what this next. 
[01:53:30]  It's just mind-boggling.  Yes.  It's Iraq.  Want to try it?  They look down on the other insects.  They deal with honey and flowers.  It's a very sophisticated life.  But they sting people.  Well, you know, you've got to protect yourself.  Oh, that's right.  You know, every animal in nature has a form of self-defense, so you won't survive.  Will you do another movie?  Who's asking?  Me.  For you?  No.  No, not for me.  For a major studio, perhaps.  No, I don't know.  I have no idea. 
[01:54:00]  I never planned anything in my career.  Jerry's great, though.  But the thing with Larry is, it's like he really thinks he can just wing these interviews.  These cannot be prepared questions.  No.  He fucking stinks.  He does.  He's just winging it.  Will you do another movie?  Another movie?  We're just sitting, bullshitting, me and you.  But they're not even good bullshitting questions.  O.J., will you make another movie?  Do you still get naked gun residuals, or do they go into your wife's decapitated torso? 
[01:54:30]  Which one?  This is mind-boggling.  What's the matter?  They're not...  Not even close to matching up.  Really?  What was that one?  I don't know.  I'd look down the hall to see if...  Let's see if it's coming.  Let's just put it this way.  If it's coming.  Track 28 should be two seconds long.  In the player, it's 26 seconds long.  I'm looking at my...  That's not even close.  I'm looking at my cup of water to see if E-Rock's walking down the hallway.  It's kind of...  This is not organized right.  It's all fucked up. 
[01:55:00]  It's all jumbled, like treats in his belly.  Here it comes.  I'm not yelling at anybody.  E-Rock says, I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  Whoever did it, did it.  Meaning he had an intern do his work.  Oh, boy.  Here he comes.  This doesn't even...  For the second time of the day.  E-Rock!  This doesn't even match up.  Yeah.  Hi, buddy.  What's going up there?  What's going on there, E-Rock? 
[01:55:30]  It should match up.  It's whatever was written on the disc at the time.  That's wonderful that it should match up.  Of course it should match up.  I didn't write any of that.  I mean, we could all assume that it should match up.  Uh-huh.  Track 28.  Larry calls the movie the B-movie, then asks another dumb question.  It should be two seconds long.  Instead, we get this.  The B-movie opens tomorrow everywhere.  When you're doing stand-up, you know reaction right away.  They laugh or they don't.  How do you know... 
[01:56:00]  How do you get reaction from an animated movie when you're sitting in a soundstage?  Sometimes you don't.  Sometimes you have to guess.  Sometimes you just have to throw a dart in the dark and hope you hit something.  That was a good question.  A stand-up comic doing a film asking about the immediacy of reaction.  To me, that's an appropriate question.  But the whole point of this bit that we're attempting is to play all the Larry King faux pas.  Yeah, not the times when it worked.  There's one good question.  Then this just doesn't matter. 
[01:56:30]  This is just us playing old audio.  The B-movie came out like five years ago.  We threw him a bone because he's retiring.  No, this disc doesn't match up.  Was it one of the highlighted ones?  Oh.  In your face.  In your face now.  Like I said earlier, I don't deal with simpletons.  What do you think?  Oh, shit.  No, I was playing the ones that weren't highlighted.  Why would you do that?  Oh, literal Jim.  Let's see, Rock.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Which one did we just play there? 
[01:57:00]  Larry calls the movie the B-movie, then asks another dumb question.  And this one is marked for time two seconds.  And we just played like almost a 30-second clip.  Now, what clip would be two seconds?  Do you?  That was that clip.  And the next clip, another B-movie reference, two seconds.  Oh, thank God.  Russo's ready to go because this Larry King thing is falling.  Can we hear the Seinfeld insulting him? 
[01:57:30]  That's track number 31.  I threw the disc over there.  Oh, we can do it later.  Oh, sorry.  That was easy to decapitate the boss.  Whoa!  Yeah.  Fucking boomeranged it.  Travis has him if you need him.  Oh, really?  In the right order?  I don't have the Seinfeld one.  I have some clips if we wanted to play some more stuff from Larry King.  Ah, well, this might be a case of let's cut our losses.  Yeah.  Lasted how long?  Nine years.  180 episodes.  You gave it up, right? 
[01:58:00]  I did, sir.  They didn't cancel you.  You canceled them.  You're not aware of this?  No, I'm asking you.  You think I got canceled?  Are you under the impression that I got canceled?  Have I hurt you, Jerry?  I thought that was pretty well documented.  Don't call shows.  Is this still CNN?  Don't most shows go down a little?  Most people do also.  You would.  But, yeah, no, I went off the air.  I was the number one show on television, Larry.  You were all right.  Do you know who I am?  Jewish guy, Brooklyn.  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:58:30]  75 million viewers.  Last episode.  What?  Don't take it so bad.  Well, that's a big difference between being canceled and being number one.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  We'll be right back.  Peace.  B-movie opens.  B-movie opens.  Can we get a resume in here for me?  B-movie opens tomorrow.  So Larry can go over?  That Larry could go over.  We'll be right back.  Oh.  See?  These are fun.  That, to me, is Seinfeld, right?  That is fucking Jerry Seinfeld. 
[01:59:00]  Are you canceled?  You canceled them.  All right.  Maybe we'll go back to the Larry fuck-ups later on in the show.  I have to take it.  All right.  Why don't we do that?  And then Chris Mad Dog Russo next.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Hello, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Mad Dog Russo in studio.  Things good?  Hi, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  From Mad Dog Radio.  You all right?  Jimmy, how you doing?  XM 144, Sirius 123. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I hate him.  How about you get on, Mike?  You all right?  What are you doing?  How about FAN stealing my idea of the freaking contest?  Well, how about you get on, Mike, and talk about it?  Do you know that I know about the story?  I heard about this.  You just got a big piece of it.  Hey, ridiculous.  You can't do this.  This is Chernoff.  This is not Mike.  This is Chernoff.  Chris is standing here with a five and a single in his hand, like a kook on the subway.  Where is my Federer?  Put Federer on.  Who can put a Federer on?  Are you drunk?  ESPN News.  He's drunk, I think.  No, I'm sorry.  He wants to put Federer on. 
[02:00:00]  ESPN 2, 209.  Anybody mind?  Not at all, man.  Not at all, man.  We're just trying to get to vacation.  We're just trying to get to vacation.  Vacation.  Let's see.  I don't know what channel.  ESPN 2 is in New York cable.  Do anybody know?  Do not know.  No.  You should know.  You're the sports guy.  Why not in New York?  I don't know the Chinese cable.  You're a Connecticut guy, which is different.  How's the family up?  Good?  Why?  Good?  It's great.  Anthony, how's your life?  Great.  He's got a family, too.  Come look at him.  He looks good.  I'm fine.  I was in the sun.  I was in the sun. 
[02:00:30]  I was in the sun all day yesterday.  I just sat there in the sun in my yard.  He burned his face.  He burned his face.  I was in the pool.  I'm out of the pool.  I'm back in the pool.  This place is getting to you.  Who plays Goblin?  A little sweeping wine.  You know we're on the air, right?  Oh, we are on the air.  Can you put the Federer in my job so I can see what the hell's going on, please?  This place is finally getting to you.  It's great.  You're having a breakdown in front of our faces.  I'm cracking up.  How are we all doing, Jimmy? 
[02:01:00]  I'm well.  There you go.  Federer is up.  Let's score here.  It's a men's quarters at Wimbledon.  What's the matter?  We have a radio show to do.  Burdich is up 4-3.  And serving.  And serving.  Federer could be down a set.  Oh, baby.  This is news.  This is news.  We're doing like sports talk radio.  This is a sports talk show.  Come to car.  This is how you guys do it.  You just watch and you comment.  That's great.  40-0.  This guy sucks.  No, I love 40.  It's love 40.  40 points to none.  I love 40 is what you're saying. 
[02:01:30]  I don't see Jimmy at the New Canaan Fuel Club.  That's what I'm saying.  Anthony, how you doing, big guy?  Good.  I'm doing all right.  He looks good.  He got shaved.  He looks like a handsome son of a gun today.  You know.  He fell asleep in the sun, though, yesterday.  Yeah.  He's a little red in the face.  A little bit.  A little bit.  It was a little warm yesterday.  And it was very hot.  Yes.  I went out back, of course, laid down and crapped out for about 20 minutes.  Woke up and was like, ooh.  Yeah.  Better get in the pool.  We sat on the first day of camp yesterday in my household.  So my little four-year-old went to camp. 
[02:02:00]  He is four years old.  Gets on the bus with his brothers and sisters at 8.45.  He got home at 4.20.  And my wife said he was completely wiped out, which is the perfect.  Because it's 88 degrees.  He's at camp.  He's running on it all day.  Yeah.  You're sitting out there for 20 minutes.  He's wiped out after eight hours.  That's easy.  Which is the way you'll want to do it, for goodness sakes.  That's easy for you, then, right?  Easy for me.  Yeah.  Federer down 5-3-7.  Now, you're a big tennis guy there.  Well, this is a big event right here.  No, I understand that.  I even understand that. 
[02:02:30]  I don't really like tennis too much, but I know this is a big fucking tournament.  Hey, what do you got on the longest tennis game?  John Isner.  Yeah, you talked about that on your show?  Oh, God, you know, we got a break.  It happened last Wednesday.  We were on the air when that was going on.  Was it 70-68, wasn't it?  Something like that.  Yeah, I think it was 70-68.  Isner's the nicest guy in America.  He was all over the place these last couple days.  He was on Letterman.  He did throw out the first pitch of the Yankee game last night.  But he wouldn't have done all that if he wasn't in the longest tennis game of all time.  I mean, it's funny.  No one knew who he was before that. 
[02:03:00]  The tennis fan did, but the average person had no idea.  And remember, he lost the next match, as you expected, because that was a three-day match.  Played all these games.  The next match he played, he lost 16 minutes in the first set.  Yeah.  Nicest guy in the world.  He's 6'9", went to University of Georgia, beat Loddick last year at the US Open.  Nicest guy in the world.  Patrick McInerney, the Davis Cup coach, loves him.  But he got more notoriety for winning a first-round match at Wimbledon the way he did  than he did for, you know, losing in the second round. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  There you go.  How long was that match?  It was 11 hours and 6 minutes.  The fifth set took 7 hours by itself.  That's 2 days.  That's insanity.  It's the craziest thing.  To me, it wasn't a great tennis match.  It was more about the oddity of playing such a long fifth set.  Of course.  So long.  You guys are flying.  I love those guys.  I'm in the air.  We're a day and a half from vacation.  Oh, are you really?  You know how that goes.  You just watch that clock and go, get us the fuck out of here. 
[02:04:00]  When do you come back?  Middle of August?  No, we're not Howard.  We're not Howard.  When are you?  My old Mike, he's never around in the summertime.  When are you coming back?  When are you coming back?  About a week.  About a week.  Oh, it's only a week off.  A little more than a week.  Yeah, a little week, actually.  So you're coming back July 12th.  Yep.  That's about right.  Okay.  So you get July 4th.  Yeah, you get the 4th of July and then the week afterwards, just kind of hang out.  You know what I've been trying to do is take those Fridays off in the summertime.  So that means it's only a four-day work week. 
[02:04:30]  That's what I've been trying to put together.  We're all working toward the four-day work.  See, we secretly love Howard because we know, hey, man, if they give it to Howard, they're  going to have to give it to us eventually.  He set the precedent.  No question about it.  Those four-day work weeks are good.  Hey, Angelo in Staten Island goes, hey, loves Mad Dog, better without Mike.  Oh, boy.  Has to be said.  Do we have to go into this now again?  Has to be said.  You guys are always picking on me about the whole thing with Mike.  No, there's two things I want to say.  The first, they have Mike on in my gym.  Does he even know he's on TV? 
[02:05:00]  Does the fucking guy look up ever at the camera when he's doing his dumb show?  It's a weird, when you have those, well, you've got it.  You looked up when you were with him?  At times.  You realized you were on TV and said, you know what, I'm going to look at the people every  once in a while.  This pompous ass doesn't even look up once.  It's tricky with those TV cameras in there.  Stop sticking up for Mike.  Angelo in Staten Island now getting me in trouble.  Stop sticking up for Mike.  You don't need Mike.  Anthony, help me out here for a second.  You don't need Mike.  You don't need Mikey.  No.  Oh, God.  I listen to that show because of you, sir. 
[02:05:30]  You know that.  Well, you're a good fan.  All right, all right, all right.  So we'll move on to that.  We've got a lot of sports going on.  Fill me.  Hold on, hold on.  But the fan is ripping off your bit.  Oh, that drives me crazy.  So let's at least talk about that.  And it's not my bit, but give the powers that be who came up with the idea.  I had nothing to do with it.  They said, let's go out there.  We'll spend some money and we'll do a little marketing campaign to find sort of the next  quote-unquote great young talk show.  Anthony's got the best idea for that.  Which is?  Pick a seat at Yankee Stadium.  What was the old bit again?  Oh, God. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, pick a seat.  And then whoever's sitting in the seat is your host.  You've heard of that hacky bit.  It turns out to be somebody that's been in radio forever.  Yeah, yeah.  What a coincidence.  Well, we're looking for some guy to come in.  We send, you know, send me a five, send us a five-minute tape.  We'll come up with the five finalists.  We'll put them on the air with me.  And then we'll decide, the fans will, out of those five, which two of the five that they  want to see host a two-hour show.  Oh, yeah.  And then once the two of them, on August 30th, do a two-hour show. 
[02:06:30]  It's a Monday night, first day of the U.S. Open tennis.  We'll pick one out of those two to do shows for a month.  We'll fly in.  If you live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, we'll fly in and out so you don't stay here all week.  Every day.  Saturday and Sunday.  So they're going to do Saturday and Sunday.  How great would that be?  I didn't know what the hell you're talking about for a second.  How great would that be, though?  Saturday and Sunday, they'll come in for four weeks, come in on a Friday night or a Saturday  morning and do Saturday and Sunday three hours, 24 hours of sports.  Talk for four weeks, which is a good contest. 
[02:07:00]  So I'm sitting around last week.  I was off Friday.  So I was playing last Friday.  I took my kids to a freaking Long Lake Compound, something near ESPN in an amusement park.  That's the story for the day.  But to make a long story short, on Monday, I come back, take some phone calls.  Guy calls up.  Chris, did you hear about what F.I.N.'s doing?  No, fill me in.  Well, they announced on Friday at 3 o'clock that they are looking for the next great sports  talk shows.  And this is last week after I did Letterman on Monday.  And I announced it with Letterman on Monday morning.  And now you guys did all these interviews, did all these interviews, and now five days 
[02:07:30]  after the fact, F.I.N. comes up with the same idea.  Can you come up with that?  That's ridiculous.  You can't do that.  And then they say that we've been working on this for a year, this contest.  Oh, boy.  Stop.  A year.  I did it in 20 minutes.  I mean, gee whiz.  You don't need to work on it a year.  That's a basic contest.  It's ridiculous.  It's a good contest, but it's basic.  It's a basic contest.  Correct.  So you want to push a lot of our audience over to your channel?  No, I want everybody in the same spot as well. 
[02:08:00]  I want a little smorgasbord, some here, some there.  I mean, we want to suggest our guy, Eastside Dave, to at least be in the contest.  Sure.  Is this Eastside Dave right here?  No, where is he?  I don't even know.  Who is Eastside Dave?  Oh, boy.  Look around the room.  Eastside Dave's in studio.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  I got a choice.  It's not you, is it, Opie?  That's Mars.  That's south of the border of Mars.  This doesn't sound good for Eastside Dave, because he's been trying to get a job with 
[02:08:30]  you for a while, and you don't even know who the guy is.  That's not good.  Get me a five-minute tape.  You know, everybody will get an equal opportunity.  If you put Eastside Dave on Mad Dog Radio, you're going to get a lot of our audience checking  it out.  I'm just telling you that much.  We will.  Okay.  And he's actually very good at doing some sports.  So it's perfect.  It's worth giving him a little shot.  At a five-minute tape, don't send me a tape with a sports fan.  Oh, that's Eastside Dave, by the way.  Oh, that's Eastside Dave.  Danny just threw him under the bus.  I totally threw him under the bus.  Dave really needs a gig, and you're showing Mad Dog the picture of Dave in drag. 
[02:09:00]  That's right.  I Google Eastside Dave.  That's what comes up.  So, Chris, what do they have to send you?  Send me a five-minute tape of the best you got.  Do a monologue.  Do a little rant.  Do a little rip.  Get it to me.  We'll have a little committee figuring out which five finalists should be in the mix,  and then we'll put them on here with me.  Where do they send them?  Well, you know, it's goserious.com slash MDR.  Mad Dog Radio.  That makes it easy.  Okay, let's just do that.  So they're looking for your partner?  No, it's not for my partner.  We're looking for another host.  Mad Dog's done with partners.  Right, Mad Dog? 
[02:09:30]  I've had a partner for a long time.  19 years, Jimmy, baby.  19 years.  Way too long, right?  Right, Mad Dog?  That's a long time.  Way too long.  Listen to you two.  Always looking to get me in trouble.  We don't make a contribution, Anthony, for God's sake.  They're not trying to get you in trouble.  I'm my new role.  I'm my new shine.  Ian had his segment today.  He had a really good segment on racism.  Oh, he did, Anthony.  And now me and you are going to talk sports.  We had a big racial discussion earlier.  And there's a lot going on in sports right now.  They're not trying to get you in trouble.  They're trying to see how two guys make it on their own after a partnership dissolves. 
[02:10:00]  We're looking toward you.  You guys.  How long have you guys been together?  16.  16 years.  Have you ever had a period there in the 16 years where you couldn't stand it, Joe?  Yes.  Yeah, there's been blowouts.  It started now.  In general, it's been good.  Have you ever had a three-month, I'm not talking to my partner, deal?  Oh, shit, no.  Oh, okay.  That I don't know how you'd...  I've had that.  Three months.  Wait, where you guys don't talk, only talk on air?  Even barely then.  Mike and I had a couple of those. 
[02:10:30]  We had a few of those.  You did?  Not three months, a week?  I don't remember anymore, but we did.  But I mean, we're with each other every fucking day.  Do you speak to each other in the course of the afternoon or the course of the day when  the show's over?  Not anymore.  No, if something comes up.  I mean, you call each other at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, see what's going on for the  next day?  Not anymore.  No.  No.  Emails.  Texts, maybe.  You do communicate.  Yeah, there's some.  You might want to ask the third person in the room.  That's a big no. 
[02:11:00]  That should be funny.  Not bad.  Not bad.  It's only been around 10 years.  I'm glad you noticed.  World Cup, mad dog.  Yes, I was into it until I U.S. lost.  Now I can't get into it.  That seems to be what everybody has done.  I can't get into it.  But you're only into it because we had a pretty good team this time around, right?  I was, you know, beginning of a tournament, you always get a little more into it.  You get excited.  They won two crazy games.  You know, I shouldn't say they won.  Do you like soccer, though?  No, I played it in high school.  I don't like watching it that much.  I'd never go to an MLS game. 
[02:11:30]  Will I watch the World Cup final on July 11th?  Yeah, I'll probably watch.  That's a Sunday afternoon.  I probably would have to watch that.  I'll watch that.  I'll be into it.  You know, I won't be into it, but I'll make sure I'm on top of it.  As far as the U.S. is concerned, they had a good situation.  They had the England game right off the bat.  They're playing the big English team.  So you had to keep an eye on that.  Then the Slovenia game in Game 2, they're down 2-0 at halftime, and they score three goals.  The third goal disallowed, so there was some controversy.  Which was ridiculous.  So that added something.  And then they're down 1-0.  Then it's nothing, nothing to Algeria. 
[02:12:00]  In the last game, they got a score to win, and they scored an extra couple minutes to win that game.  So there was a little juice with the United States team.  I thought it fizzled badly on Saturday.  I thought the match was not a good match.  They lose, and then since then, I have not been into it that much.  And then no one's yet.  A lot of people dropped out after that.  They're just not watching it.  It's not in the news as much.  No question about it.  Now, listen, I was shocked that the New York papers put the England game on the cover in Monday.  You know, England had a terrible loss.  They had a goal disallowed. 
[02:12:30]  You know about that goal that bounced in?  Yeah.  A lot of controversy.  A lot of controversy with these officials.  All these sports we've had with these officials here.  So I was into it.  I had to coach on three straight times after the games, Bob Bradley.  So it's not like I ignored it, but I will not spend that much time on it now.  Why doesn't America embrace soccer?  And some would argue that we are, but I don't think so.  Not like the other sports.  And why is that?  Well, why wouldn't England embrace baseball?  It's not our game. 
[02:13:00]  You know, baseball is our historical game, not soccer.  That's sort of our version of it.  So from that perspective, we're baseball, we're historically a baseball, now we're a football nation, but historically a baseball nation.  And as a result, soccer is sort of Europeans and South America's sport and baseball is our sport.  They don't embrace baseball in Europe.  We don't embrace soccer that much here in the United States.  I never think it's going to be a...  No.  Listen, it will have its moments like we saw here in the World Cup, but it will never be a big sport.  If the USA won the World Cup and had, like, the next couple of years or the next couple of them in, then the... 
[02:13:30]  I bet if soccer as a whole, people who make money on soccer were rooting for the United States, because then you'd have the whole country buying soccer gear and stuff like that.  Yeah, but that would be short-lived, I'm thinking.  You're probably right.  I think of that.  I don't think the World Cup's only going to be four years.  What do you do in the interim, man?  Right, right.  Three years before you hit the next World Cup.  For about a year, they'll play it out, and then it'll go back to where it is.  But let's give soccer its due.  19 million people watched that Saturday game against Ghana.  That's a 2 o'clock in the afternoon game on a Saturday, and 19 million people watched. 
[02:14:00]  Now, give me another sport where 19 million people watched.  Well, the NBA Game 7 of the Finals, 25 million.  Okay, there you go.  That's not terrible.  Here's another one that you'd like.  19 million people for that game.  That was the average viewers per game, Yankees and the Phillies in last year's World Series.  Wow.  So the U.S. Ghana game, one game, got the same amount of audience that a Yankee-Philly World Series got.  But a very different audience, you would have to think.  Yes. 
[02:14:30]  You know, to get that kind of people to watch, you've got to get the casual sports fan.  There's not that many soccer fans.  You've got to get unemployed people who can watch it at 2 in the afternoon.  On a Saturday.  Baseball is not working, though.  Did you watch it Saturday?  I did watch it.  Oh, there you go.  Did you watch it?  Did you have an idea what was going on?  No.  I really didn't get into that at all.  At all.  Right from the start, I was just like, Matt.  I'm watching these games, and I don't even know if I'm, I tweeted this, I don't know if  I'm watching a good soccer game.  In other sports, you know when you're watching a really good football game, a really good  hockey game. 
[02:15:00]  Correct.  I'm watching this soccer game, like, I don't even know if it's a good game.  And everyone's yelling and screaming at me and trying to explain why it was a good  game.  I get it.  It's a hard game.  You know, there's so much little subtlety in the game.  There's not enough goals.  So there's not, it's a weird sport.  But 19 million, so there you go.  Yeah, right on, man.  Some people, more than you thought, got into it.  You know, this is old news, but we haven't talked to you in a while.  Jim Joyce, the perfect game.  No, we had you.  I was on that day with you guys.  Yes, he was.  Fuck, I don't remember.  I was 10 days ago.  I was on that day with you.  I slept a lot in the last seven weeks.  Wait, what did you say, though?  Just to refresh my memory. 
[02:15:30]  I said, Jimmy disagreed.  I said, you can't overturn the call.  You got to let the call stand.  I'd like to see instant replay in baseball.  Now, listen, it's funny.  I went to Strasburg's first game down in D.C.  You know, when he pitched.  Is he the real deal?  No, he's really good.  Yeah.  So I was there for that game.  I had all the baseball guys on.  The fans and media want instant replay, some sort of, to correct these terrible calls.  The folks in baseball don't.  So it's not like Joe Torre wants instant replay.  Why is that?  You know, they think the game's long enough, human element. 
[02:16:00]  They don't want to upset the flaw of the game.  The flow of the game.  Oh, what assholes.  There's no flow to a baseball game anymore.  I think you got to have some sort of instant replay.  But the folks in the sport don't want it.  So that's whatever it is.  Baseball fans will continue to do what sports fans do, which is just take it in the ass.  It's like if the sport is that bad at doing their job, stop.  I haven't been to a live sporting event in years.  Why?  Because, hey, fuck yeah.  I won't go.  I won't go.  Everyone else is filling the seats, though, Jimmy. 
[02:16:30]  Let them do it.  Good for them.  There's a little protest, dude.  For naught.  I don't mind that.  There's someone waiting for your seat.  Let them.  But don't complain when they start throwing a charge at you just to have the right to own  the seat.  Oh, the PSLs.  I totally agree.  If you're going to go to the sporting games and you're going to get annoyed about the PSL,  don't buy the tickets.  It's not buying milk.  Right.  It's not essential.  You can live.  Your games are on TV.  Yep.  You don't have to go to the games.  It's a perfect game.  It just was a great opportunity for some great PR.  And for baseball to do the right thing in baseball.  Baseball, you know, baseball had a good week with that.  The umpire handled himself well, apologized, went to Galarraga. 
[02:17:00]  Galarraga, the pitcher, did not moan and groan about it.  He handled it.  They took out the lineup court the next day.  Yeah.  That handled it well.  Leland, the Tiger manager, nobody moaned and groaned.  Baseball, actually, sportsmanship and all those kinds of things.  Baseball came across okay.  Everyone but Bud Seelig, who basically is just a cuckold owner.  Well, he doesn't like Bud.  I don't like him.  I hate him.  I don't like him.  I think he's irrelevant.  I don't think he does anything.  I think sometimes as a man, you've got to stand up and make a tough decision. 
[02:17:30]  This is not a foul call that Stern has to overturn in basketball.  This is a legitimate 100%.  We all know it.  And the outcome could not have humanly possibly been different if it had been made correctly.  It's where you get those circumstances.  A lot of people disagree with that premise, but I understand if the immediate reaction is  the kid pitched the perfect game.  On your show, the fans, what are they?  50-50.  Really?  Yeah, 50-50 on instant replay.  Probably a little more.  No, 50-50 on the call.  Yeah, 50-50.  I think most people thought, you know, some people thought like Jimmy did. 
[02:18:00]  Some people said, you know what, you do this, and then you've got to change this thing,  you've got to change that.  Let's go back to this World Series game.  Let's go back to that.  That's what I mean by it's a tough call.  It's not a bad precedent.  What about the Pintar?  Huh?  The Pintar incident.  Oh, with George Brett.  But that didn't change everything.  No, but the Pintar, they allowed that home run to stand.  What they did was the Yankees, they called the home run no good, and the Royals appealed,  and the home run eventually stood.  So why didn't they appeal a call, and why didn't the Tigers appeal?  Because that's a judge, because the Pintar is a rule thing. 
[02:18:30]  A rule and a judgment.  Right, right.  But isn't it a rule if you get to the fucking base before the ball gets safe?  Isn't that a rule?  And Bud Sealy just comes out and goes, look, this is a one-time thing.  I'm not looking at other calls.  I just decided right now that I want this to be overturned, and that's it.  Be a man.  I don't think Bud wanted that Pandora's box.  There you go.  Right, whatever.  And the best part of the George Brett incident, when they had to come back and finish the  game, and there was, what, 1,000 people?  It was top of the 8th, top of the 9th, and the Royals won the game. 
[02:19:00]  Boy, that's a good memory, you guys remember that.  Well, the clip online is hilarious, because they had to come back and finish that game,  and, I mean, who's going all the way to the stadium for fucking one inning?  I bet the Scooter didn't even win for that game.  I bet you Messer and White had to cover that one.  The Scooter stayed home.  What year was that, 82, 83?  Oh, that's your world.  I don't know.  Buddy Morton was the manager.  I'm going to say early 80s.  Yeah, this is so goddamn entertaining.  They come running out of that George Brett rules.  And, by the way, the home-playing umpire in this game who made it that he was out is 
[02:19:30]  Tim McClellan.  Wow, he's still around.  Tim McClellan, still around.  Wow.  And he's the guy last year in the Angel-Yankee playoff game that got screwed up at third base  and the two guys got stood.  Same umpire.  No kidding.  And not only that, in 2007, McClellan was the home-playing umpire, Padres Rockies in  the wild-card playing game, winners makes the postseason, Holliday scored at the plate,  he caught him safe, never touched home plate.  So he's had a lot of controversy.  So he's a bum.  Well, I don't know about that. 
[02:20:00]  Another guy who can't do his job.  84, 83.  When Brett comes running out of that dugout like a mad...  That's great.  His eyes like a mad person.  That was a famous scene.  We're talking 27 years ago.  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  27 years.  27 years.  Hey, I don't know how much time we got with you.  LeBron James.  We got time.  Go ahead.  At midnight, he becomes a free agent.  Here's what I want to say.  Now, a lot of people are starting to say Miami.  I don't think that...  Let's sum up the...  Break it down.  Break it down.  I'll break it down for you quickly.  All right. 
[02:20:30]  Number one, when this whole process started, I thought he'd stay with Cleveland.  Loyalty, Akron, the Cavs have done a good job of trying to maintain a good ball club.  They obviously fizzled this year.  I thought Cavs...  Can I jump in for a second?  Fizzled.  Yeah.  Oh, they were terrible.  He completely fell apart in the playoffs.  He had that one terrible game.  And they had a great team to go all the way this year.  Well, that's the issue.  I think they probably were a little overrated.  What was that about?  Well, they had a bad game five.  There was a lot of rumors that things occurred between a teammate and everything else. 
[02:21:00]  What do you know about that?  I don't know who knows.  One of the players sleeping with LeBron's mom.  That was the rumor.  That was a heavy rumor.  And then he came out the next day and played terribly.  And West is...  Terribly is an understatement.  Game five.  It was one of his worst games ever.  When they needed him the most.  Correct.  But if that's a fair enough reason, if this is the case, if that is accurate, well, that  would explain such a bad performance.  Sure.  But I still think Cleveland, at the time, at the end of the year, was the favorite. 
[02:21:30]  The Knicks are not going to get LeBron James.  The fact that he's not coming to New York for a little wine and dine thing tells you  something right off the bat.  Can I jump in?  The reason is because it'll take way too long to get a championship with LeBron James, right?  That's how it stinks.  Because he really needs to start winning championships now.  Well, he needs some players around him.  And the Knicks have nobody.  Now, the Knicks have...  He comes to New York, and they're going to still need two or three more years to build  a team around him.  Now, the Knicks have the max.  They can bring two guys in.  But now, so can Chicago, who's made these moves in the last week or so. 
[02:22:00]  So the Bulls can bring two guys in, too.  Him and Chris Bosh or something like that.  And the Bulls have Derek Rose.  The Bulls have a decent supporting cast now.  They made the playoffs last year.  So if you bring LeBron in with Bosh, all of a sudden, that's a big-time team.  So I thought Chicago now is in the mix.  My opinion on that, why would you want to go where Michael Jordan was?  Unless you're going to be the greatest player of all time, which LeBron James has a chance  if he starts winning championships.  If you don't get that title, you want to at least be the greatest player for a certain franchise. 
[02:22:30]  Excellent job.  Anthony, we make a contribution!  It's sports.  I sit here.  But that's what I'm thinking.  Why would he do that?  He would be in Michael Jordan's shoes the entire time he's in Chicago.  He'd have to win at least six fucking championships there.  That's a great point.  That's why I don't think Chicago.  I felt the same way, but Jordan's his buddy.  He's going to wear his uniform number next year.  He may not look at it like you and I look at it.  I wouldn't go there either for that very reason. 
[02:23:00]  But it doesn't sound like that's that big a factor for him.  Because I agree with you.  I wouldn't go there where they've got a trophy.  They've got a statue outside.  But by the same token, if Chicago makes its presentation in the next day or so and Jordan picks up the phone and calls him, maybe that has some influence.  But a lot of people think since then, he could actually show up as a conquering hero because they've kind of sucked since Jordan left.  It's not like they've been winning.  That's true, too.  So he could be a guy to recapture glory.  Yeah, exactly.  He could be strong.  That's a good way to look at it, too.  Now, remember, ESPN got caught in this. 
[02:23:30]  They've got a million guys.  This is the big enchilada of his story.  The guy who can tell you where LeBron's going before anybody else can, and he turns out to be true, they look pretty good with this scenario.  So right now you have all the ESPN guys trying to tell you, as we saw at this Miami thing, that we are going to be the first to tell you where LeBron ends up.  So that's where this Miami Heat thing came up in the last couple days, that they had this grand meeting over the weekend with the three free agents, Bosch, LeBron, and Dwayne Wade. 
[02:24:00]  But ESPN reported that.  But as it turned out, Wade was in Chicago, and LeBron was never there.  So don't believe or listen to anything you hear.  I don't think LeBron knows right now where he's showing up.  I think it's Bulls.  I think it's Bulls-Cavs.  I think it's going to be in Maine, like a AAA farm team.  You know, the Maine Cranberries.  Now, that's not good enough.  Is it going to be the Bulls or the Cavs?  If you had to say right now.  I'll say loyalty.  He's got a mansion in Akron. 
[02:24:30]  I think the Cavs have been good to him.  He hasn't won a championship there yet.  He's been playing there his whole life.  I think he has signed a three-year contract with Cleveland.  With Cleveland.  Wow.  That's what I think.  We're just going to put the Knicks in a tough spot, because if you've read today, the Knicks are going to be at 9 o'clock tonight.  Midnight our time.  9 o'clock in L.A.  They're going to be in L.A. tonight to talk to Joe Johnson.  He's an Atlanta Hawk free agent, and they're going to try to get him signed to a max to a big contract.  Then they're going to go to Phoenix. 
[02:25:00]  Dolan's going.  Then they're going to go to Phoenix to talk to the Suns forward Amari Stoudemire.  Right.  And then tomorrow at 1, they're going to be in Akron, and they're going to talk to LeBron tomorrow at 1.  What they think the Knicks are going to try to tell LeBron, listen, LeBron, we have Joe Johnson signed, so our team is better all of a sudden.  Right.  I think that's what they're going to try to convince LeBron.  Try to get somebody on the team before they talk to LeBron tomorrow afternoon.  And the Knicks got a lot of money to spend.  Well, so do we.  But remember, it's a Saturday capping in the NBA.  Right, right.  So they're not the Yankees.  The Knicks have money. 
[02:25:30]  The Bulls have money.  All these teams have the same amount of money.  Okay.  So it's not a case.  Their money is not an advantage.  And remember the other thing about the NBA that's very important.  The existing team has a better chance to sign a player.  The Cavs can give LeBron $30 million more than any other team can.  Ah.  That's how you keep them one.  One extra year, one extra year, and $30 million more.  Yeah, that's how you get these guys to re-sign for the same team.  So that's why there's not as much movement in the NBA.  That's incentive.  Because I think it's fair. 
[02:26:00]  It's kind of smart.  You're trying to keep the teams.  It's not like the Yankees every year being such a great team.  I like that.  Now, let's talk about vacation time.  You make me jealous.  Jimmy, you first.  What are you doing next week?  You got gigs?  You got stand-up?  I'll be performing this weekend, and then next week I'm in Montreal performing at the festival.  Oh, really?  So you've got to work hard.  So this is not a week off for you.  What are you doing now?  I'm going to go see Jimmy down at the Borgata on the second and third.  And depending on how I do, I might stay for the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh. 
[02:26:30]  We'll see how things go at the tables.  What a life he's got.  It's a lot of fun.  It's doing all right for him.  I mean, I'm still cleaning rear ends with little babies.  Oh, my God.  With my tongue.  No, you're not supposed to laugh at that.  You're right.  I should.  You've got a much different show than us.  You should be laughing at us.  I should.  That was kind of funny.  All right.  Now, how about you? 
[02:27:00]  I'm just trying to protect your image.  My image.  My image.  Not as clean as you think.  Now, how about you?  What do you got?  I got an eight-week, my son's eight weeks old, and I think we're going to venture out  and drive all the way to Rochester, New York to see Brother Wee's and do a little cottage  action on the lake.  What is the, and congratulations, by the way.  I should have sent you a little, I should have sent you something for that.  A little car seat.  He's been in the car many times.  Yeah?  What is his name?  Hudson.  I like that name.  Well, when was he born? 
[02:27:30]  What day?  Mother's Day.  Really?  Yeah.  Was that cesarean, or is it regular?  Here we go.  Regular.  Regular.  Oh, you didn't plan it then.  Okay.  So it just happened to be Mother's Day.  Well, we had it planned, but my stupid doctor was on vacation.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  She was 11 days late, and the doctor thought, oh, you can make it to 14 days late.  That's kind of crazy talk right there.  Most first babies are late.  My wife is seven days late with mine.  So you had it on May 9th.  First, how many pounds, how many ounces? 
[02:28:00]  Nine pounds, four ounces.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  A long baby.  Mine was, my first was 9'2", so there you go.  Is your wife tall?  Yes.  Yes, my wife's tall.  My wife's tall, too, so we got a long baby out of the deal.  Did you take some days off after that?  I've probably, officially I took a week off, but from the show I probably took about a month off.  Now.  I've been tired, man.  It is.  I've been tired.  Are you sharing the taking care of child in the middle of the night?  What are you doing with that? 
[02:28:30]  He's sleeping the night already.  Are you serious?  After eight weeks?  Sleep in the night.  We got rid of the two o'clock feeding a few weeks in.  Oh, my gosh.  We're really lucky.  That is tremendous.  Right now it's like 10, 10.30 to 5.30.  You can't beat that.  And you do the 5.30.  Well, then you, no.  You can't do that.  I help when I can.  No, she's been beyond cool.  But then I give her a break when I get home and all that.  How do you feel being a father?  Fill me in.  Is it what you thought it would be?  They don't want to hear this out there.  Come on, you and I.  Honestly, I fucking love it. 
[02:29:00]  You're into it totally.  I was always into being a father.  It just didn't work out for many years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's way better than I thought it would be.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How old are you?  40 what?  Yeah.  I'm an old father.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  I'm an old father.  See, it's interesting because when you have children, it takes you sometimes a little  while to attach to it.  My first, same thing.  As soon as it was born, I loved it to no end.  Other ones, it kind of took me a little while to grow on. 
[02:29:30]  Well, really?  It really does.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's a stranger in your house all of a sudden.  It's like, who are you?  What are you doing here?  And then you feel like you're just babysitting and someone's going to knock on the door and  go, all right, thanks for babysitting my kid.  And then you realize, wait a minute.  No, this is going to be a while.  How about your wife?  I mean, there's a bond there with that wife and child.  Oh, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we can't get to.  It's a father.  Nobody cares.  But, I mean, congratulations.  I should have done a much better job of acknowledging that. 
[02:30:00]  It's just amazing to me that guys do completely, not change completely, but as far as a child  being there and then having this unconditional love and adoration for this baby.  And I look around like, wow, I just can't get it.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Isn't that how you feel when you saw your new iPhone?  There you go.  Think of that.  No, but I should.  Buy a new gun.  But I should say this, which might help Anthony a little bit.  I mean, he doesn't want this, and that's fine. 
[02:30:30]  That's what it's all about.  I hate kids.  I hate everyone's kids.  You do, really?  And I never held a newborn before my own son.  I did for the picture.  Like, here, hold them.  All right, take the picture.  All right, great.  Here you go.  Did you cut the umbilical cord?  Yeah, but I didn't care about that shit.  They forced me to.  It's weird how you can't cut right through that.  I thought it would be an easy cut.  Yeah, you got it.  You're sawing away, basically.  It's creepy.  God damn.  But when I saw my own son, it was a whole different thing. 
[02:31:00]  I'm like, oh, right on.  So right away.  When it's yours, it's like, okay.  Now you get the idea.  Yeah.  But other people's kids, I'm like everyone else.  Yuck.  I probably hit your kids mad, though.  There are times.  I mean, number one thing, too.  Small kids, small problems.  Big kids, big problems.  So, I mean, you know, it gets harder.  I understand.  It's not going to be a cakewalk.  You're going to have more than one, are you not?  I'd like to, yeah.  But, I mean, you know, I'm getting up there.  Breaking that news.  You're not that old.  Oh, you thought I was only going to have one?  No, I had no idea.  No, I'm going to have a few.  Well, I was 39 when my first child was born. 
[02:31:30]  You know, my wife had four kids in seven years, so I'm 50.  Jesus.  I'm 58 years younger than me, or 43.  I'm 50, so my first child came at 39, and my last came at 45.  So, think about it.  For me, I'm going to be 60 and have a 15-year-old in high school.  I'm not so ridiculous.  It's going to sort of have that beat, so.  No, you know how old are you, Obey?  How old are you?  I'm 50.  All right.  I'm getting there.  Oh!  I'm getting there. 
[02:32:00]  Geez, are you really?  We're getting there.  So, it's, you know, I didn't get married until I was 35 years old.  First marriage of 35.  But it's, you know, it's funny.  The last one I had, in 2005, a boy, you know, I felt the same immediate attraction to him,  and now he can't stand me.  He wants nothing to freaking do with me.  And he's only five years old?  He's four.  He's five in July.  All he wants is his mother.  It's unbelievable.  The other ones love me, and the four-year-old can't stand me.  It's the strangest thing in the world.  Can't stand you. 
[02:32:30]  Can't stand you.  Get away from me.  Go.  Go away.  Go away.  I hate you, Daddy.  Oh, my.  He says that?  Put him outside.  Put him outside for a while during the winter.  But when my mother, when my wife's away, and he's with me, can't get enough of me.  It's the strangest thing in the world.  It's the kid dynamic.  You should remind him of that.  Like, when he's hungry and she's away, say, well, you remember your earlier remarks?  Yeah.  Now you don't eat.  You may wonder where men goes.  Well, congratulations on that. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I'm pumped.  So this week, you're going to Rochester for the week?  Yeah, a little cottage action, hopefully.  When are you leaving?  Friday morning?  Like, tomorrow, maybe.  Oh, you're taking Friday off?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm taking Friday off.  The listeners don't know that.  We were going to fake that.  Thanks, Michael.  You're welcome.  You got a lot of the stuff.  Like, you got to pack all that stuff up for him.  He knows.  Pack and play.  I'll tell you, that's the one thing.  A lot of gear.  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable.  I realize my car's not big enough already.  You got to get these vans.  You got to get these town cars. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, man.  I'm not doing a minivan.  I think you should get a minivan.  I'm not a fucking minivan.  Yeah, but you should minivan.  A baby on boards thing on the back.  Yeah, yeah.  I watched my brothers.  When they hit their third kid, they had to go minivan.  How many brothers do you have?  Four.  One of seven.  Oh, you really?  Yeah.  Five boys, two girls.  They all have children?  No, not really.  Half of us, like, late or no, and the other half, yes.  Okay.  You should get that.  The minivan.  And then, yeah, even Janine is saying the little stick figures of the daddy, the mommy, and the little kids. 
[02:34:00]  You line them up in the back window.  I think maybe if we go three, I might not have a choice, but I saw my brothers handle it with two kids with the regular cars.  Nothing makes your testosterone drop like that side door sliding open.  The sound of that.  You remember that scene?  You remember that scene in The Sopranos when he was going to, when Michael was going to go turn on, when Christopher was going to go turn on Tony, and he was going to run away because his wife got caught undercover. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he was at the grocery store, and he saw the guy come out of the grocery store to three kids, and he was putting gas in the car.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he said to myself, I don't want this.  Yeah.  And then he went back and got, what was her name, his girlfriend?  Adriana.  Adriana.  He turned on Adriana and so killed her.  Yeah.  And that all came because he went to that grocery store, and he realized that if he left Tony, this was going to be his life. 
[02:35:00]  And it was four kids coming out of the time of that.  He was struggling with bags.  The kids were yelling at him and all.  That's the kind of thing you've got to do with it.  Screw that.  Adriana getting killed.  That was a rough scene.  No.  Who wasn't turned on?  That was a rough one.  Here's what I do.  Because when you have kids, it's a compromise.  Last Friday, I took the day off.  I took all four kids to this amusement park up in Bristol, Connecticut.  All four of them with a junior in high school.  So, because I've got to have the rides, I can't, the little one can't go on the same rides that the 11-year-old can. 
[02:35:30]  So, I took four.  I came back, left at 8 o'clock in the morning, came back at 9 o'clock at night.  But the next day, I played golf in a golf tournament, gone for six hours.  Wife couldn't say anything.  Hold on.  You got to make these deals.  You have to make these deals.  Wife couldn't say anything.  How much easier is my life?  I have to pack Cialis in a cock ring for a week.  It's so much easier.  It's so much harder.  Being single and garbage.  Oh, it's so much harder.  You know, as I have a basketball coach in the mind who always says the same thing when he has kids. 
[02:36:00]  You know when the men's weekend begins?  Monday morning at 8 o'clock when you go back to work.  Oh, right, right.  Because the weekend is just...  The weekends are brutal.  Now, listen.  Is your handicap horrible?  I've been playing well right now.  It's about a 15.  Fuck.  I've been playing well right now.  Damn, that's all right.  Matter of fact, I was in a golf tournament.  I take a 15.  I'm in this golf tournament right now.  You guys don't follow golf.  But I'm so proud of this result.  Last year, I collapsed late.  Same event. 
[02:36:30]  It's 48 players for 15 spots.  Metal play.  Every ball in the cup.  No mulligans.  Nothing like that.  No gimmies.  Nothing.  You know, it boils under the chin.  You can't kick it.  You gotta hit the...  I mean, it's...  I shot an 87 on Saturday morning, minus the handicap, is a 70.  So 87 minus 7.  So I made this field of 15 from 48.  And then there's match play after that, where you play hole by hole with handicap.  And I won my first one last Sunday.  There you go.  So I play Saturday at 9.07 in the morning, round of 8. 
[02:37:00]  Now, I told my wife when I went to the amusement park, listen, Jeannie, if I win, if I qualify  Saturday, I gotta play Sunday.  So she's aware of that.  She did not realize that if I win Sunday, I gotta play this Saturday.  Nor is she aware of the fact that if I win Saturday, I play Sunday.  Nor is she aware of the fact that if I play Sunday, I'm playing July 4th.  So deal with it, for God's sake.  In the morning at 9 o'clock, you have the four kids.  Oh, my God.  You're so screwed.  I almost want to lose now, for God's sake.  You don't want to do it. 
[02:37:30]  You're in trouble, man.  That's the sort of deal, Jimmy.  This is what you have to look for.  Have you ever been married, Jim?  Never even.  I've never had them more than three nights in a row at my apartment.  One day.  One day.  Can you see them getting married?  Honestly, Jimmy, yeah.  Believe it or not, yeah.  No, Anthony, you're divorced, right?  Thank God.  How many years are you married?  I was married nine years.  Nine years.  I've been divorced for...  I've been...  No children, right?  No.  No. 
[02:38:00]  No kids, no house, no nothing.  I had nothing.  Do you see...  It sounds like he's had it forever with marriage.  Oh, yeah.  He's done.  I will never get married.  Never a chance.  Not a chance.  No desire to have a kid.  No.  No.  Don't want a kid.  I mean, my brother and sister both have kids now, like little kids, like two years old.  So you have good relationship with them?  That's fine.  Oh, yeah.  They're great.  I love having them all over here.  Uncle Anthony, they love it.  Okay.  They go in the pool.  It's all fun.  They splash around.  Yeah, it's all... 
[02:38:30]  But, you know, here's the good thing.  You can get rid of them.  Yeah, that's it.  Then they leave and it's fine.  Why don't we show Mad Dog what you've been up to in your basement instead of raising kids  like myself and Mad Dog?  What?  Trying to...  Because now I'm hearing it just made iHeartChaos.com, their website.  Yes.  Is that a...  I don't even know that website.  That's good.  I'm just...  This is what...  Mad Dog, this is what our pal Anthony's up to.  Instead of being married and having kids.  Well, yeah, show them that one.  I have been doing karaoke and putting it on YouTube, but it's not interesting just doing 
[02:39:00]  karaoke, so...  Oh, my God.  I have my gun collection.  Will you stop at the gun?  That's a real gun.  I have my gun collection.  That's his .50 Cal.  That's real.  Yeah, that's a...  It's not a toy gun, Mad Dog.  Uh, M107 Barrett, uh, .50 Cal.  Listen to the voice.  Listen to the voice.  It's beautiful.  Oh, it's haunting.  Oh, Cat Stevens.  Oh, Cat Stevens.  Beautiful.  He's singing over a track, though.  It's lip syncing.  Is that a real gun?  Is that a real gun, Anthony?  Oh, that's a real gun. 
[02:39:30]  That's a 50 Cal.  Licensed, I hope.  Well, you don't need a license for a rifle.  Oh, you don't?  No.  Just pistols.  Are you serious by that?  Yeah, Long Island.  Who knows?  In New York State, you don't.  I mean, you have to have a license for this, right?  In New York City, you need a license.  You don't have to have a license for a rifle.  You walk in, you give me a license, your driver's license, his ID, they call their little  FBI thing.  They make sure you're not a convict.  And then you walk out with a .50 caliber.  Unbelievable.  Takes Browning machine gun rounds. 
[02:40:00]  How much does that cost, that gun?  That's a very expensive weapon.  A couple thousand dollars?  More than that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that is a very expensive firearm.  So that's what he said to.  So I do that.  I take various guns from my collection, and I sing karaoke.  Crazy gun guns.  He's not ready for fatherhood.  No.  Can you imagine what it would take to baby-proof his house?  Oh, jeez.  So you have not gotten to this stage, I can't deal with this tonight.  You have not gotten with that stage. 
[02:40:30]  Strange enough.  Good for you.  Well, it's only eight weeks.  Good for you.  No, I know.  I know it's going to be.  Hey, look, look, he's happy as a land, this one.  I know.  He likes being a daddy.  Likes being a daddy.  Good for him.  Hey, good for him.  It's calmed me the fuck down.  Good for him.  You know what?  Good for him.  I tell you, the bond with your wife when that child is born is the greatest bond you're  ever going to see in your life.  When you see that child come out, and you realize that you and your wife put it together,  that is, I felt, an unbelievable bond at that point.  Yeah, it was.  Did you feel the same way?  Yeah.  I don't even know what I saw.  I like the bond you feel during conception.  That's true.  That does help, too. 
[02:41:00]  That's a good bond.  That might go away a little bit, too, when our kids come in.  He may not know that yet, but it's going to happen.  Oh, hell.  Yeah, we're kind of aware of that.  Not with us, but just we've seen it happen, so we're, you know, hopefully, hopefully not.  Yeah, it's harder.  Isn't it like just a time thing?  Like, you don't, you can't find the time.  Kids, I mean, they get kids.  Listen, I got four kids.  You know how many times the kid comes into your room in the middle of the night because  he's sick?  He doesn't feel well, or she doesn't feel well, got a headache, nightmare, nightmare. 
[02:41:30]  And what if you're, you know.  I know she wants to sleep with mommy and daddy.  Eh, it's not that easy.  That man talks in hell.  Oh, my gosh.  He's in hell.  I can see why, when you get older, you can see why, when you talk to families and their kids  are off to college, or they're out of college and they have their first job, and everybody  says to you, oh, finally got them out of the house.  You can understand when you have kids around for a long time what they mean in that situation.  Forgetting that.  Federer's about to get through this second set of set of pieces.  There you go.  He's doing all right. 
[02:42:00]  Well, set of piece.  He's not out of it yet.  He's up 5-3 serving in the second set.  And you're, yeah, you're really a big tennis player.  Well, this is a big event.  I know that about you.  I love the tennis.  No, and you play and everything.  Oh, I loved it.  Yeah.  Are you any good?  Yeah, I'm pretty good.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Pretty good.  I'm not bad.  You know, I'm a better tennis player than a golfer.  But again, this is all issues when you have kids.  It's not that easy to go out there and play.  How fast is your serve?  Has it ever been measured?  No, it has not.  You must have over the years for the hell of a year.  You know, I don't.  You know, it's not.  When you get to my age, it's about keeping a ball on the court. 
[02:42:30]  It's about keeping rallies going.  It's not about blasting people away with first serves, you know?  You know anything about tennis, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's like if you hit the net, bad, over net, good.  Does the lines count?  If it hits the line, in or out?  Well, I mean, technically, it's in.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Unless the score is love 30.  What does that mean?  Unless you're playing Anthony, then it's love 15.  Why can't it just be basic points? 
[02:43:00]  Why do they have to do that?  One, two, three, four, instead of this one?  Yeah, why not?  All right, Jimmy.  Tennis is a European game.  Did we do all the sports stories?  We did LeBron.  We did the World Cup.  College World Series?  No one really...  I can't get into that.  Okay, I didn't think so.  You've got the baseball going on right now, too.  You know, the Yankees are playing well.  Mets...  How are your Giants?  I've been very down on them.  Very down on them.  Oh, boy.  Big Giants fan.  They've been awful.  Which is strange to me, because you're from this area, right?  Well, I've always loved the Giants, but I've been very down on them. 
[02:43:30]  Lincecum hasn't pitched well.  Their best players are not playing well, which is a major problem.  They can't win games in their division.  You know, the Giants...  Remember about the Giants, too.  Haven't won a World Series since 1954.  Wow.  Which is only two...  There's only, like, three teams that have a longer dry spell.  The Cubs and the Indians.  That's all you need to know.  And the dry spells between a giant last playoff game that they played was 2003.  You know the only seven teams in the sport who got a longer dry spell?  Well, the Royals, the Reds, the Pirates, the Orioles.  I mean, that's the Giants.  Willie Mays. 
[02:44:00]  This shouldn't be happening.  I didn't know that about your team.  Oh, they've been very bad.  And I've played a playoff game since 2003.  There's only seven or eight teams in the sport who got a longer dry spell.  Wow.  That's ridiculous.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the Giants of Mays, McCovey, Marischal, Barry Bonds.  It drives you crazy.  So, there you go.  What am I going to tell you?  But you stay with them.  Yeah, but fandom is all about.  But I don't think I'm going to win it.  I don't think I'll see them win a championship.  Do you get out to Candlestick?  AT&T, that new park.  I used to go to Candlestick all the time. 
[02:44:30]  Sorry, sorry.  I've been to that park.  I hate that it's all corporate.  Oh, I hate.  Well, they need the money.  It's nice to hear Candlestick Park, right?  They need the money to help play for it.  They have the logo there, but it's still called Candlestick Park.  I don't know.  I understand where you're coming from.  But do you get out there once a year or no?  I haven't been there for a couple years.  I have been there, though.  I was there for the World Series when they played the Angels and blew it.  And I was there the first game they ever played in the ballpark.  I was there.  I've been there about three, four times.  Nice park.  Beautiful park.  What do you think of...  All-Star game.  I was in the All-Star game three years ago, and I was there for that, too. 
[02:45:00]  What do you think of Sterling's calls on that?  Oh, I love them.  Do you?  The home run calls?  No, you don't.  You can't love them.  You must find them constantly.  I hate the Yankees, and I hate the Yankees.  Why do you love the home run calls?  It makes me laugh.  We goof on them relentlessly.  We think it's a great home run call right before the nickname.  Right before he comes up with a wacky name.  Did you hear the one last week when Granderson hit the home run against Arizona?  Oh, horrible.  The Grandy Man Candle.  Because it's all about me.  Not about the guy hitting the home run. 
[02:45:30]  It's all about me.  People do say...  Did you hear the...  How about the Canola?  Wait, wait, wait.  We got it.  We got it.  With two out.  The two-two.  Swallowed air goes.  Deep right field.  It is high.  Middle is far.  It is gone.  It's a Grand Slam.  Stop.  It's a Granderson Slam.  The Grandy Man Candle.  Oh, the Grandy Man Candle.  Curtis Granderson.  It's invasive.  Throws a Grand Slam over the high scoreboard wall. 
[02:46:00]  It's invasive.  And it's forced, man.  Oh, no, no, no.  You hear how it's forced.  That one was forced.  One thing about Sterling, he loves the Yankees.  His life is...  Yeah, we understand.  But he shoe-horns his own fucking thing in there.  It drives me nuts.  He thinks he's playing.  He thinks he's playing.  And not only that, he's got a little man next to him.  A little man?  Yeah, a little man.  He talks to him during the game.  Did you guys know that?  What?  Seriously?  No.  Wait, what?  Yes, he's got a little man.  Oh, no.  He's got a little man.  Susan Wadden? 
[02:46:30]  I'm like, how dare you say that about Susan Wadden?  He's an imaginary one, but he's got a little man.  He absolutely loves...  He loves that little man.  Wait, what are you talking about?  I'm serious.  He's got a little imaginary man next to him.  Is he in a boat?  That he talks to the man in the course of the game.  Can you believe that call?  Can you believe this?  Can you believe that?  So in his own mind...  Oh, so he's having a discussion with somebody, and it sounds more conversational.  Yeah, exactly right.  So that's what he does.  In between innings and all those guys.  Does he look over to the invisible man?  No, but he knows he's there. 
[02:47:00]  Does he put a little doll on?  No, he didn't put a doll.  You know what they taught us in radio?  And Sterling, by the way, is a good guy.  Dan D.B. is a good guy.  He seems like a good guy.  You know, he's different.  I'm sure you've had him on the show many times.  He's different, but he's a good guy.  Has he ever taken three months of not talking to the little man because they were fighting?  That's a good start.  I remember, you know, he's not missed a Yankee game since 1988.  That's amazing.  That is amazing.  And he's got four kids.  How about you take a day off?  Wow.  How about you take a day off?  No one's going to miss you. 
[02:47:30]  No one's going to miss you.  That's why.  He's got four kids at home.  He can't wait to get on the road.  No, he's divorced.  Every amazing thing that could happen in baseball would happen that one day that he didn't show off.  I know.  That's exactly what he's afraid of.  That's what he's afraid of.  I'm sure.  And he does nine innings, though.  He doesn't share the game with somebody else doing the broadcast.  Right, yeah.  Every other broadcasting team on radio, one guy does five innings, one guy does four.  Not John.  He does all nine.  What do you mean?  I don't know that.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, Howie doesn't do all the innings.  He does five innings.  Yeah, you hear that kind of leaves.  And then where does he go? 
[02:48:00]  Well, he stays there, but he stays there, but he doesn't do the four.  He doesn't do the play-by-play.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  And Sterling does the nine innings of every play.  Look, look outside.  That's his ball.  The Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Oh, God.  Have a good vacation, will you please?  Yes, we absolutely will.  I'm hoping.  All right, so the big promotion for you again.  You're looking for...  We're looking for the best sports talk show host in America.  I mean, whether you are...  Now, listen, if you're Chris Berman, you're not going to apply for this job, but if you 
[02:48:30]  are a kid...  He's like Dave, I'm telling you.  If you have a desire to get yourself going, you're in a bad scenario, you're a radio guy,  send me a...  Send us, Sirius.com slash Mad Dog Radio.  Send me a five-minute tape.  He's like Dave has two sick kids.  Could you help him out?  No.  Get me a tape.  I can't play favorites.  You know that.  But get me a tape, and we'll go from there.  And then it'll become one of five, one of two.  And if you win this contest, you get 24 hours of sports talk on our channel.  We'll fly you back and forth, Saturdays and Sundays in the month of, let's say, September. 
[02:49:00]  Whatever it might be.  And what happens after that?  If you're good, we'll hire you.  Well, we'll see.  Yeah, all right.  It's okay.  There's no guarantees about full-time employment.  But there is a guarantee that you'll be on for a month.  Yeah.  And FAN cannot steal.  We had this.  That's ridiculous.  That wasn't even me.  It was people upstairs.  That's ridiculous.  It's not my contest.  It's their contest.  Yeah.  I'm just doing it on our channel.  But I took a year to come up.  You've got to be kidding me.  A year to come up with it.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  Right.  Okay.  And, of course, Mad Dog Radio. 
[02:49:30]  I'm a fan.  I listen as much as I can.  XM 144, Sirius 123.  Opie, congratulations.  Thank you, sir.  I should have sent you something, and that's a bad job.  You know what?  It's not too late.  I can get you something.  I expect your gift.  Did you get a million of them?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone's been very generous.  Very nice.  Yeah, I got 93 when the first kid was born.  93 gifts?  You counted?  I remember.  We had to send 93 thank you notes.  Yeah, we're a little lost on the thank you notes right now.  93.  I think we got it under control.  93.  93 gifts.  You enjoy your Montreal and your shows next week in Atlantic City. 
[02:50:00]  Atlantic City.  AC.  How are ticket sales?  Good down there?  Very good.  Get the sun going, may I please?  Of course.  And don't be so afraid of getting married again.  Oh, please.  That's crazy talk.  No, no shot at all.  That's like I came out of the nom and you're telling me to go back.  Did you ever set him up with a date?  No, no, no.  Do you date?  Ant does well on his own.  Yeah.  Oh, you do date?  Yeah.  Oh.  You make sure nobody's interested in getting married. 
[02:50:30]  Bad dog.  Yeah.  What you need to understand, Ant went nine years and then went eight years after that.  Not a second marriage, but he went nine years marriage and then an eight year relationship  right after.  A long term relationship.  So I've been in a monogamous relationship.  Which one was worse, the marriage or the eight year relationship?  No, the eight year relationship was fine.  She's still cool.  I still talk to her.  Yeah, she's all right.  You know, she's cool.  Yeah.  But the ex-wife was just a fucking nightmare.  You get involved in a bad marriage, it's tough.  We should go out for some beers.  I'll tell you some stories. 
[02:51:00]  When you come back.  My favorite, Anthony's.  You know, I know you have to go, but now it's one of my favorites.  Go ahead.  Me and Ant used to drive back and forth to Long Island, you know, because that rides  hell on fucking hell.  So we would take turns.  Right.  Yeah.  And one night I'm driving Anthony back to his place.  We both lived in Huntington.  And the light, not the light, sorry, there were candles in all the windows.  Yeah, candles.  And I'm like, all right, man, this sounds like, it looks like, I knew, but I was busting  his balls.  I'm like, wow, you got a nice night ahead of you. 
[02:51:30]  At this point, I knew it was over, you know.  I just knew it was over.  I had no interest.  And it was romance night where the candles were all lit.  They planned romance night, or it was her idea to try to get things going again.  Yeah.  And so the candles, man.  Did it work?  And all, no, all I was thinking was, I want to finish the next level in Half-Life.  The video game.  But I go to Ed.  That's all I was thinking.  I go to Ed.  He wanted to go around the block a couple times.  He goes, yeah.  So we just kind of drove around.  Just keep going.  You know it's over.  And my relationship wasn't much better at the time.  And here we had this amazing radio show, and people just didn't know that our personal 
[02:52:00]  lives were fucking.  Well, I was a mess.  We're not good.  We're not good.  When we went around the block a few times, I'd come back and the house would be on fire.  Right from the candle.  That's tough.  I really did not want to go in there and perform.  And then another time I picked them up, two quick stories, and she's on the front stoop  yelling a screen at them.  And I'm like, you just woke up.  What could you have possibly done wrong?  You haven't been up long.  It's 10 o'clock in the morning.  I didn't vacuum.  It was like 9, 10 in the morning.  I didn't vacuum, or I didn't put out the garbage or something. 
[02:52:30]  It was something.  I'm like, how could you be getting yelled at already?  It's way too early.  It was like, how about you do it?  How about you do it?  A honey to-do list.  Yeah.  You got a honey to-do list?  Sometimes I do.  After that golf.  Mine was get divorced.  Things to do.  Get a divorce.  All right.  Hey, Mad Dog, it's a pleasure.  Don't be a stranger.  I was just over here.  Don't be a stranger.  I was over there thinking I was the history.  You were even here.  Don't be a stranger.  I was over here to replay.  I know you were.  Let's go 10 days ago. 
[02:53:00]  We want you in studio.  I love you, big guy.  All right.  Mad Dog, thank you.  Mad Dog Radio XM 144 series, 123, two to seven, five-hour show.  You got to talk to the boss.  That's too long, five hours.  That's ridiculous.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, we got Billy Hayes coming in.  Yes.  That's going to be great.  Midnight Express.  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm very much looking forward to talking to him.  Hard out at 10, so we're losing time with Billy Hayes.  All right.  We'll do a quick break.  Why didn't they tell us?  We didn't know that.  I think they was up there for a while.  I didn't see it either.  It's okay. 
[02:53:30]  It'll be fine.  We'll do a quick break.  We'll get Billy Hayes right in here.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got to get right back into this because we don't have a lot of time with Billy Hayes  in studio.  Yes.  What's up, Billy?  We were just apologizing to Billy saying, hey, man, we're running a little late today.  And you said it was cool because you were laughing.  I'm listening to minivans and candles in the windows.  All right.  So you're all right?  I was in prison myself for nine years.  It was called a marriage. 
[02:54:00]  It was, I think, comparable to what you went through.  Well, I had a 30-year sentence eventually, but I've been married for 30 years, so it  kind of balances out a little bit.  Best thing I ever did, getting married.  Not the easiest thing I ever did.  Really?  But the best thing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's been good for me.  I needed it.  And then this is the people that know who Billy is.  The movie Midnight Express is Billy.  Based on, yeah.  It's based on him and his life and his experience.  And what happened.  Wow.  Now, starting from, I guess, the beginning of that situation, had you been smuggling 
[02:54:30]  hashish from Turkey prior to that?  Yeah, actually.  It's one of the reasons I wanted to do Locked Up Abroad, because they gave me a chance to  tell the full story.  The full story, right.  Which I couldn't do when I first got back.  And I got back and I wrote a book.  I got home on a Friday and by Monday I was writing a book.  Wow.  So a really strange transition from prison to suddenly being this little mini-celebrity and  getting off to Planet Kennedy with a press conference of the year.  For a hundred people asking me a question, Billy, Billy, what's it feel like to be home?  I don't know.  I just got here.  I haven't seen my mother yet.  It never stopped.  Wow.  But I couldn't, because of legal reasons with the U.S. government, I couldn't write the 
[02:55:00]  fact that I'd done three prior trips to getting arrested.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because obviously the movie made it look like, you know, innocent guy, just figured he's  going to take one shot at it.  The movie made a lot of changes in the story.  Yeah.  I'm a filmmaker now myself, so I understand why they made some of the changes.  Others is, you know, having to do with the producers.  And their attitudes.  Did you like the movie in general, though?  I loved it.  I mean, Alan Parker did a great job.  Sure.  Brad Davis, you know, he put his heart and soul into the film.  Yeah.  Oliver Stone wrote the script. 
[02:55:30]  Mm-hmm.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I sat, he was unknown back then when we did it.  He had written a script.  I spent a week in the Mayfair Hotel with him, 10 hours a day, seven straight days, talking  about, he read the galley of my book.  And being in a room with Oliver back then, ah, like being in a washing machine on tilt.  Really?  Walking in the morning, you know, there's joints and lines rolled out, you know, bloody  Mary's all set up.  And he was so crazy.  He'd actually written a script called Platoon that got him the job writing Midnight Express, 
[02:56:00]  but nobody in Hollywood would make Platoon.  Hey, were you still, were you doing drugs with him?  Time of the war.  Oh, sorry, were you still partying when you got back from Turkey or did you not get high  anymore?  I started as soon as I could, actually.  But being with Oliver, that's partying.  Again, I love him.  He's so intense.  You don't want to slow him down just for a second here.  I mean, Platoon, he just casually said, you know, the Platoon script was written, but  Hollywood just kind of sat on it.  They wouldn't make it for another five years.  He just said, because it was too close to the war. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, too close to the war.  Way too close, but it's also why he was so intense and so angry, nobody would make his  story, and that was his heart.  He just knew he had.  It was an odd time for Vietnam-era movies, because when it was too close to the war,  they were really kind of like coming home.  Right.  Movies like that, where it was very emotional and not very action-based, and then they kind  of got into the realism of the war.  Platoon was fantastic.  Yeah, they did.  Sure.  And he wrote my script, and the stuff in...  Midnight Express, the movie that's a little bit over the top relative to my story, I 
[02:57:00]  think is Oliver getting his own stuff in there.  Oh, getting his own, yeah.  There's a scene in the courtroom scene where I come back, where I originally, I was supposed  to be, I got a four-year sentence, I'm supposed to go free in 54 days, they changed my sentence  to life.  Boom!  Bingo.  Yeah, exactly.  That scene in there where I get to talk to the court, they're going to, you know,  they just changed my sentence.  I'm going free in 54 days, and now suddenly I've got a life sentence, which the judge could reduce  to 30 years.  Wait, let me, in real life, how did that happen?  Like, you were sentenced to four years, and you did your time, almost, or how much time 
[02:57:30]  had you done with, you had 54 days to go?  I did, it was a four-year, two-month sentence, and blah, blah, blah, with time off for good  behavior, I was counting down the days to 54 days, then the American Council showed up  unexpectedly.  I knew instantly, I looked at his face, bad news.  I'm thinking, somebody at home, somebody hurt, not bad news for me.  I'm going free in 54 days, there's no bad news for me.  But, yeah, the high court in Ankara reversed it.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that Richard fucking Nixon, I love Sirius, you can say what  you need.  Richard fucking Nixon started the war on drugs, and the U.S. giving aid to all these foreign 
[02:58:00]  countries, they pressured all the foreign countries to increase their drug laws, which they did.  But the people who bore the brunt of it were fools like me, you know?  And the high court in Ankara reversed the sentence and said, instead of just possession, which  I originally was charged with, they charged me with smuggling, and they gave me the full  sentence, which was life.  Which, you know, I was like the sky falling on my head.  Yeah.  It just stunned me.  And at that point, the escape switch went back on. 
[02:58:30]  Because it was on from the first day I got there, and then I went through a whole bunch  of attempts to get out.  Eventually, I went to a madhouse.  There's an article in Turkish Constitution that says, if you're a judge crazy, they can't  keep you in prison.  But if you're that nuts, they don't let you on the street.  So I went to this madhouse to try and convince them I was crazy, which most of my friends  didn't think I'd have a lot of trouble doing.  And then I got to Bakikoy Mental Institution.  It's a section for the criminally insane.  I saw the competition.  It was really difficult.  It was really hard to try to fake that. 
[02:59:00]  It was mad.  Was it like Nicholson and Cuckoo's Nest, where you wanted to go there to get out of jail, and  you realized, like, what the fuck did I just put myself into?  Exactly.  I wanted to escape from that place, because it was...  It was easier, less than the...  What was the craziest thing you saw in that scenario?  Just people talking to themselves, obviously.  Yes.  I mean, there was one guy with this big lump on his head, and he kept rubbing it and rubbing  it and rubbing it.  I mean, it was bloody.  It was raw.  And the whole time I was there, he never stopped rubbing it.  Holy shit.  It was this broken...  How do you compete with that?  Not at all.  I went in.  A couple of the outside doctors came in, and I got to do my, you know, why are you talking 
[02:59:30]  to me?  Am I crazy?  And I'm telling him, and he'd ask me these questions.  I'd be screaming and yell, stop writing!  What are you writing down there?  But the bottom line is, they ask me a question, I answer.  They ask me a question, I answer.  How crazy can I be, no matter what I say?  So a little while, they said, all right, go off.  I kind of want to run through it.  Now, when you got arrested, how did that play out?  Just like the film, actually.  Just like the film.  So you had the hash on you.  Oh, yeah.  Taped it to my body.  Actually, the first time I brought it back, I had taped the hash to my leg and then wrapped 
[03:00:00]  this cast around my leg.  I was working in Milwaukee, and I was in college, in Marquette University, doing this child psychiatric  aid, part-time work in this hospital.  Wandering around the hospital, I saw them do a cast, which is this plaster of Paris tape.  You stick it in the water, you wrap it.  I thought, that's easy.  A friend of mine had just come back from Istanbul.  He'd brought a couple little plaques of hash with him in his money belt.  Nobody searched you back in 1969, getting on a plane.  You know, you walk on a plane with a chicken under your arm, nobody even noticed that. 
[03:00:30]  It didn't even matter.  He came back, he told me, you know, it was great, hash.  And he said, you know, it's cheap, it's easy, you can buy it on the street.  I'm thinking, cheap, easy, hash on the street.  And I'm walking around the hospital, and I see this cast, and I'm thinking, hmm, hash,  Istanbul, cast, bingo.  So I wrapped it around my leg, and then wrapped the cast around it.  And then I clumped through customs, and everybody was very sympathetic.  Oh, you know, my college vacation was interrupted by this unfortunate accident, 
[03:01:00]  and meanwhile, I've got all this hash in my leg.  How much did you have?  Two kilos, which is, you know, four pounds of hash.  Wow.  It's not much.  And I made like five grand each trip, which, considering the consequences of the actions,  not much.  I should have done it on a much bigger scale, but I was just doing it just for the adventure.  I wanted to get out into the world, see life so I could write about it.  Surprise, surprise.  When you look at the times, you know, late 60s, early 70s, and think about that,  a young guy going to Turkey to smuggle hash, it does sound kind of intriguing and exciting. 
[03:01:30]  It was for me, and, of course, I knew I was smart enough and good-looking enough to pull this off.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, for a while, I was right.  Well, that was the first time, right?  That was the first time.  And then you got away with it a second time.  The problem is I got to customs in Istanbul, and they stamped the passport, and everything was good.  And then the customs guy said, where's your doctor's note for the broken leg?  I don't have hash in here.  Doctor's note.  Doctor's note.  So he passed me through, and actually, the stewardess on the plane changed my seat. 
[03:02:00]  They were very nice to me, so I could stretch out my hash-filled cast on the plate.  But I got to New York customs, I passed through, I had my big bag, and I'm clomping through,  and it's banging against my cast.  Somebody helps me put the bag up on the table.  And the customs guy is looking through, and I look up, and there's my three friends who finance this thing.  Wow.  Up behind the visitor's gallery, behind the glass, screaming and yelling.  That freaked me out.  And I look back down, and I notice my cast is crumbling, and I'm leaving this white trail behind me,  which really freaked me out, but nobody noticed. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Off I went.  But the second time, I realized, let's not do the cast thing again, with the doctor's note and the cast crumbling.  So I just taped it to my body and put a big heavy sweater.  I'm real skinny.  I put a big heavy sweater over it and got on the plane.  Again, nobody searched you getting on the plane back then.  What is the feeling when you're walking?  Maybe a little different back then than it would be today,  but the feeling when you're walking with drugs strapped to you to get onto a plane,  and you're going through customs, what's going through your mind?  I was very young and very confident that I could pull anything off. 
[03:03:00]  So you weren't really thinking of consequences?  I have one message for all the kids out there who are listening.  Do what you like.  Know what you're doing.  Know what you're doing means being aware of the consequences of your actions, because I wasn't.  And what I discovered, of course, was the consequences of my actions, I'd get arrested,  and then suddenly I realized, holy shit, my parents suffered every day while I was in jail.  By far the hardest part of prison for me, the fact that my mom went to sleep every night knowing her kids in jail, 
[03:03:30]  it tore my heart out.  What kind of upbringing did you have?  Briefly, like, were you well off?  Was your family well off?  Middle class.  I was raised on Long Island with you guys.  Born in the Bronx, but actually we moved to Long Island when I was six.  Babylon, just down the coast from Huntington.  WBAB.  There you go, exactly.  I used to do radio stuff out there at WBAB when I first came back doing the book.  What year?  Oh, God, when did the book come out?  76?  Yeah, around there.  I talked to those guys down there.  So, you know, I had an easy, my life was so easy until I got busted.  I didn't even know it.  I took everything for granted. 
[03:04:00]  So you were a normal suburban kid back in the...  Exactly, protesting the 60s and Vietnam War, taking everything for the United States for granted  until I lost it all in one moment.  And then suddenly it's like, whoa.  Now, going back to that moment where now you went back, you strapped it to yourself,  you taped it to yourself, however you did it.  Now, what was different this time?  And when did you get tipped off like, oh, shit, this is going to go bad?  First time I had the cast at work.  Second time I taped it to my body at work.  Third time I taped it to my body, again, it worked. 
[03:04:30]  I just stepped on the plane.  Again, I knew I could pull this off.  Between the third and the fourth time, the PLO hijacked the first of the jets, blew them  up in the desert, which started all the security that's so common now.  I knew that.  I went out to the airport the day before I was going to fly out, looked, nobody was  getting body searched.  They didn't have any kind of metal.  Oh, you did a little recon.  Of course.  Yeah, I'm no fool.  I'm thinking, piece of cake.  I can pull this off.  I went back to visit the American girl who was studying belly dancing in Istanbul, who  loved to show me her moves.  So once again, my dick leading me astray. 
[03:05:00]  And I get out there the next day.  I go through customs.  Nobody searched me.  No problem.  James Bond, international drug smoker, has done it again.  And then they put us in a little room downstairs for a while, which is a little odd, but no  problem.  And then he put us on a bus to take us out to the plane, which is a little odd, but no  problem.  I'm through customs.  Yeah.  And then the buses and some lady's talking to me and I'm listening.  And then the bus kind of pulls up and stops.  I look out the window, there's like Turkish soldiers surrounding the plane with this ramp  in front of the, they were searching people right at the boarding ramp. 
[03:05:30]  Again, they didn't have, you know, a metal.  Now your initial thought, your initial reaction, everything.  My first thought was to deny reality.  This can't be happening.  This can't be happening to me.  I'm playing this out.  I'm way too smart.  This can't be happening to me.  But it was, I dropped to the floor.  I tried to make believe I'd lost my passport and I didn't want to get off the bus.  And they had all the men getting off the back and this kindly old lady sitting next to  me said, Oh, there's your passport, son, right there in your top pocket.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks lady.  So I got off the bus and I wish if I could have, I would have, but I couldn't unstrap 
[03:06:00]  the shit.  I've got a tape to my body and all of them.  How many, how many levels of tape?  Like how many?  I got hash under my arms.  I've got hash around my waist and I've got hash in my boots.  Oh, so you went for a big one.  It was two, two kilos.  That's about all I could smother me.  And you couldn't have ripped the table off quickly?  No, I couldn't get it off.  It was impossible.  So I got off the bus and I'm thinking, I can't get back to the airport because we're way out  in the runway and there's nowhere to go.  So all I can do is they would, they had a boarding table set up in front of the boarding  room with two cops here and searching all the men as they circled around. 
[03:06:30]  And I was just, I had to kind of bluff my way past and I went past the first cop, just  slide by and I almost got past the second guy.  I literally had, I was putting my Frisbee back in my shoulder bag as if I'd been searched.  And I literally had my foot in the air.  People say, oh, that's dramatic.  You make it up.  No, I did.  I was that close to the boarding rep in this hand to grab my shoulder.  And this first cop, I knew right then, this is the moment.  This is it.  My whole life is hanging in this moment.  The first cop back here, he just happened to finish with a prisoner and turned his head 
[03:07:00]  and the cop next to me looked at him and nodded.  Did you search this guy?  And the second guy said, no, I didn't.  So now the hand tightens because he knows I just lied to him.  And he puts my arms in the air and he starts to search.  He hit these hard plaques under my arms and kept going.  And he hit these hard plaques around my waist and kept going.  You're just thinking like, oh, I might get through this.  He's moving down towards my boots.  And I used to, I was raised a Catholic, but me and the church separated at puberty, about  the age of reason.  And I hate religion.  I think religion is the source of most human misery. 
[03:07:30]  But I find myself praying, please, Jesus, get me out of this shit.  I will never do this shit again.  But again, I'm praying to the wrong God in the wrong country.  And the next time the guy came up, he hit these hard plaques under my arms.  At that moment, I knew it.  I could see it in his eyes.  They're out here looking for plastic explosives and bombers.  And he thinks he's just found somebody wired.  He freaked out.  He dropped back and grabbed his gun and started screaming, bomba, bomba.  And all those soldiers put their rifles down.  I got my arms in here thinking I'm going to be shot.  It took him a moment.  He stuck this shaking gun into my stomach and lifted up my sweater. 
[03:08:00]  And when he saw what was there, it took him a moment.  But then he realized, that's hashish.  That's how he started.  Esral took it.  He said, Esral, Esral, Esral.  He was so relieved to put his gun down.  All the soldiers put their guns down.  Everybody was relieved except me, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  You're fucked.  Exactly.  What did they do from that moment?  They cuff you right there and they put you?  No, they grabbed me there and took me back to a little room in the airport full of soldiers and cops. 
[03:08:30]  And they had a table there.  And then they ripped all this hash off from around my waist and under my arms and piled it up on the table.  And then I went through about an hour of two and three policemen up front.  But, you know, they wanted my name and then, you know, you got my passport right in front of me.  That's a great scene in the movie where it's like, William Hayes.  William Hayes.  William Hayes.  William Hayes.  They have each cop came in.  About every five minutes, another top cop came in and bumped this guy over who bumped that guy.  Like musical chairs, bumped the next guy.  And the next guy would say, name. 
[03:09:00]  Like, what the fuck?  You got my passport.  You got a...  And William, William Hayes.  We did this for about 20, 30 minutes and then a photographer came in with big sticks and a camera with the whole hood that goes over his head.  And the cops stood me up and they piled all the hash in my arms.  And these cops all stood next to me like big game hunters with a prize and fixed their tie and fixing their hats.  And it was so surreal.  I just...  I had to laugh.  And the photographer came out from under his hood and said something, which I guess is, you know, why is this asshole smiling? 
[03:09:30]  So the cop on my right went, whap, and backhanded me to the nuts, which dropped to the floor, dropped all the hash.  But then they lifted me up and put the hash back in my arms.  I guess I had the right look on my face.  A smile went away.  Yeah, oh, it did indeed.  And they took the photo.  And, you know, after an hour or so, some guy showed up.  And all I know is he was an American.  I called them techs.  I'm assuming he's DEA.  But he was American and he signed some papers and he actually took me out of this little room.  Were you hoping he could help you?  Instantly.  That's all I thought.  Help me.  Somebody help me get me out of here. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, he's an American.  He just drove me from the airport back to Istanbul to Sarkozy police station where the beginning of the processing was.  So there was an American in you alone?  Yes.  Actually, he sat me down in the car.  He was standing out in front, signing some papers, talking to the Turks.  And I'm in this little car and I don't have any cuffs on or anything.  I'm thinking, you know, I'll get, we'll drive, I'll get by the water, I'll open the door, roll out.  I've gone from James Bond international smuggler to Steve McQueen, the great escape. 
[03:10:30]  And I'm going to drive into the water and swim away.  And I've got these thoughts when I hear the door and I feel him sit down.  I turn my head and there's a gun pressed up against my temple.  And he says, William, you seem like a nice enough kid.  But if you try and escape, I'll blow your fucking brains out.  And I believed him.  I decided I'll wait a while to try and escape.  You know, it took me another five years to get out.  But I was, he also, he's the guy that said, you know, he told me about how severe the drug laws are here in Turkey.  Now, again, because they've changed them because of the war on drugs and Nixon. 
[03:11:00]  And he also said, you know, this is going to be real tough on your family, which for me, man, oh, it hurt.  I mean, the prison, even the worst parts of jail, the dirt, the violence, all that shit, you can deal with that.  You'll handle it.  Prison, if you're a victim on the outside, you will be a victim on the inside.  If you're not, you're not.  You constantly get tested.  But the problem is, you know, my parents.  Yeah, that came across in the movie, too, when your father comes to visit you.  That killed me, that killed me. 
[03:11:30]  Did that happen?  Did your father come and visit you?  Yeah, I'm sure my dad came to visit.  And, you know, we didn't have my mom come, which is great, because I just, it would have killed her to see me.  Did he think she shouldn't come, or did she not want to come?  No, he didn't.  No, she wanted to, but he didn't think it was right.  And I'm so glad she didn't.  It was just hard enough on my dad to see me.  I mean, I love seeing him there, and it broke my heart to see him there at the same time.  Again, that's.  What did you guys talk about?  You know, we're going to get a lawyer, and they're going to get you out of here, and, you know.  What did he say to you when he saw you in jail?  One of the first things he says was, you know, I'll punch you in the nose later. 
[03:12:00]  Right now, let's deal with getting you out.  Now, as you say this, I see you're very emotional still to this day, obviously.  Forty years later.  I did this locked up thing.  I see it.  This kid, the director who did the locked up episode, he got me talking a bit, and he was good.  He was like my wife.  He didn't let me get away with anything.  Brutally honest, my wife.  Which you love, because everybody's so bullshitty, especially in Hollywood, blowing smoke up your ass.  Tell me the truth.  That's what I needed.  And he kind of, as soon as we'd get to stuff that was really deep, I'd scurry around, and he'd say, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:12:30]  Let's go back.  Slow down a little bit, right.  And he really got to the stuff which really is still, to this day, I can barely talk about it without cracking up.  Do you feel, like, guilt over it, or is it shame that they had to see you?  You still do?  Still to this day, terrible guilt that I put my folks through all that.  And the point is, you know, I wasn't thinking.  I thought I was so smart and so clever, and I had the world by the balls.  Really, I wasn't considering at all the consequences of my actions. 
[03:13:00]  Why do you think the story really took off like it did?  Because there were plenty of dopey kids that screwed up and went to prison.  I was the first guy to get a life sentence, and I think the publicity that came out of my situation, you know, affected people.  Everybody, when the movie came out, and Midnight Express hit, everybody can relate, because everyone's traveled.  You've gone through customs somewhere, and if it's not you, it could be your brother, your nephew.  Somebody knows somebody who either got busted, might have got busted.  After the film came out, I had so many people come up and tell me, they kind of like look sideways, both ways, make sure nobody else was listening. 
[03:13:30]  They'd say, we don't usually tell people this, but, and they'd tell me their stories.  And they're like a husband and wife.  They went on vacation, and they were in Morocco, and they had a bunch of hash with them, and they're coming back into Spain.  And they said, we thought Midnight Express, and we got rid of our hash, and we got body searched, cavity searched, coming into Spain.  He said, so you and your movie kept us from being busted.  It's like, oh, there's a little bit of good balance on my karmic skills.  You're not lying, because there's a couple guys right on the phone saying you've saved their lives. 
[03:14:00]  There you go.  We don't have to go to them, because you just said the exact same thing.  It's the truth, though.  I mean, at the very least, it should be an obvious lesson, you know?  Right.  Don't do this.  The movie, I think the amazing thing about the movie or the experience is it's absolute helplessness is what you feel watching it.  Like, that's what it's like to be alone and helpless from a place where you're not alone and helpless.  Like, that to me was what, like, God, to the horror of being in a foreign country where mom and dad, because you were, how old were you, 23? 
[03:14:30]  23 when I was busted.  And your parents, your whole life, I'm 41, and I would still, like, look to your parents.  It's just what you do.  Mom and dad can get me out of this.  No one has any power to get you out of it.  No, including the U.S. government.  People say, why didn't the U.S. government help?  Well, one, I'm a hash smuggler.  They don't give a shit.  And, you know, if I'm a diplomat's son, they can trade some chits, maybe.  But there's very little that the U.S. or any other government can do in a foreign country.  They've got their own laws.  You may not like them.  You may not agree with them.  But you're subject to them.  And ignorance is not an excuse.  When you watched, have you watched any of the other Locked Up Abroad programs? 
[03:15:00]  I've watched all of them except there's new seasons.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  But I saw them all.  Yeah, because I love the show.  It's one reason I wanted to do the show, because I'd seen one thing.  And, in fact, the producers, the guy who started the show, he said, you know, it was your story  that inspired us to do this series.  Absolutely, yeah.  Now, do you watch those, and as it's playing out, just go, oh, shit.  Oh, God, you idiot.  I always say, you idiot.  You idiot.  You idiot.  Didn't you learn anything from my experience?  I mean, you learn by experience.  In this case, better somebody else's than your own, man. 
[03:15:30]  Have you ever watched one and thought, wow, you know, I went through some shit, but, wow,  that is a really bad experience.  Yeah, there was, you know, the guy caught by the Khmer Rouge, one of those groups somewhere  that kept him in the jungles, and that's, for me, prison was a bad thing, no doubt about  it.  But you kind of, you learn, you acclimate, and for me, it was probably the best thing  that ever happened, because it taught me stuff.  I learned lessons about myself.  I learned about strengths and weaknesses.  I discovered some other inner stuff, you know.  There's a scene in the movie, how much of the prison guard and his brutality was true? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, my problem with the movie Midnight Express is you don't see a single good Turk in the  whole film, and it creates this overall impression that all Turks are like that, and the whole  country is terrible.  It's not.  I love this thumble.  I got along great with the Turks until I got arrested.  Don't go to prison.  You won't like it.  But that's true of any country, anywhere.  Sure.  But that guard was accurately portrayed.  He was a sadist.  He loved to hurt people.  He'd come in, and everybody would go into this little POW stance, and you'd look down and  try not to send out any vibe, because you did not want this fucker focusing on you. 
[03:16:30]  But most of the guards, they were just guys doing a really tough job under real dangerous  circumstances, making no money, which is why they were so open to bribes.  But they were guys.  And, you know, Turkey took a real bad rap from the movie Midnight Express.  When I escaped, they didn't put out an interval warrant for my arrest.  I mean, they were looking for me, but once I got out, they didn't.  When my book came out, they didn't.  But when the movie came out, they were furious, particularly because of that scene in the  courtroom, where I get resentenced, and you hear me, Billy, saying, you know, you're a 
[03:17:00]  nation of pigs, and I fuck you all.  I fuck your mothers, and you fuck your grandmothers.  They hated that scene.  They were so crazy.  In truth, what I said, you know, I'd been in jail for more than four years.  Now I'm getting a change, but I discovered some stuff.  I got into inner light and love, and all this kind of bullshit that everybody talks about  in prison.  But it happened to be true in my case.  I discovered my reason for being, which is to love.  It sounds so trite.  It sounds so silly, but it's the truth, and it's the strongest thing I've ever known, 
[03:17:30]  and it still is the truth for me.  My head leads me astray.  My balls leave me astray.  I hate religion, but love, that energy here, that's the truth.  That's what I know.  I needed something.  My whole life was about to deteriorate, and I wanted to tell the court something and  make them...  I wanted to affect them.  They got my life in their hands.  They have no idea who I am as a human being.  So what I said was something along the lines of, I've been in your prison for more than  four years.  If you're going to sentence me to more prison, I can't agree with you.  All I can do is forgive you. 
[03:18:00]  And that's what I said.  And they were affected.  All judges kind of nodded their heads and lowered their eyes, and their soldiers too.  And then they sentenced me to 30 years.  The judge, the same guy who gave me the four-year sentence, his prerogative was to lower the  life sentence that I got from the high court to 30 years, which, thank you, I guess.  30 years life is all the same.  And then they chained me up and took me out, and Oliver Stone, he said, he read the galley  of the book, and he said, how can you forgive these people?  I said, yeah, because I was at the love and light, and I was, you know, my whole world was 
[03:18:30]  crumbling.  I was trying to keep it together, and he said, how did you feel the next morning when you  woke up?  I was like, oh, I hate you.  That's what he put into the movie.  And it's not true to what I said, and it really, the Turks were, to this day, there are  people who said, oh, we'll never go to Turkey because of Midnight Express.  Well, no, man, don't go and get busted.  Don't smuggle drugs, or at least do it smarter than I did, but don't get busted and go to  prison.  But I like Turkey.  Can you go anywhere?  Like, are you afraid to go anywhere because they have an extradition treaty with Turkey? 
[03:19:00]  For about 20 years, there was an extradition treaty that really limited my travel.  But again, I really wasn't up for far-off exotic places.  I had enough.  I wanted to stay home.  I could go somewhere far off.  I could go to Hawaii.  Thank you very much.  But, you know, my mom and my wife were not happy that I still had this.  But now that's been dropped.  Actually, I got to go back to Turkey about two years ago.  Wow.  That's crazy.  How did that happen?  It was so strange.  The warrant had been dropped.  I've been saying the same stuff I'm saying now about, you know, the movie didn't disservice  to Turkey.  It's not a bad place.  Don't get busted, but et cetera. 
[03:19:30]  So I'd done this.  I sent this to some Turk.  I was at the Cannes Film Festival, I don't know, 12, 15 years ago, trying to pitch some movie  somewhere, and this Turk heard me talking, and he said, would you say that on the camera?  I said, I've been saying it from the beginning, but my little voice is drowned out by these  images.  I mean, film is such a powerful medium.  And so he took a little camera, and he filmed me saying the same shit about I like Turkey  and such, and I don't know what YouTube was, but he got it on YouTube, and it's still on  YouTube, and some Turkish police in Istanbul saw this video of me saying I like Turkey, and 
[03:20:00]  I'd like to make amends, and they contacted me.  They had a big international conference over there two years ago.  They had 1,000 police officers from 85 countries talking about peace and global security.  A lot of world press was coming, so these guys invited me over, and they said, we'd like  you to speak, and let's make some amends, and I was the most hated man in Turkey for so  many years, and I don't like that, so I wanted to somehow balance it.  So these cops brought me back.  All my New York friends said, you ever hear about, hey, come to Yankee Stadium and win 
[03:20:30]  your prize, and you get arrested for your back.  They lock you back up.  But the bottom line is, the last thing the Turks wanted was more bad publicity from Billy  Hayes.  So I went back there, and I spent four days.  I had literally a police escort 24 hours a day around me.  A guy slept in a chair outside of my room.  They were worried about violence against me because I was so hated.  You were a celebrity.  Yeah, but I was also a hated celebrity because of, I mean, Turkey suffered hugely because  of the violence.  Did you go back to the jail at all when you were there? 
[03:21:00]  I did, actually.  I couldn't go in, but it was so weird.  I was standing outside on the street in the prison from where I could look inside the prison  when I was in there.  I used to look out across the wall in a barbed wire, and it's in the, it's in metropolitan,  so it's in the city.  And I could look down and see the street and see life and people and women and stuff walking  around.  I got to stand on that sidewalk and look up at the very window that I used to look  out.  What a bizarre experience that was.  I got to travel around the city a little bit.  I actually went back to the pudding shop, which was the famous little hippie hangout 
[03:21:30]  where, you know, people traveling back and forth from India, there's a bulletin board,  you leave messages, and I walked into the pudding shop.  I've got my police escort, and when I walk into the pudding shop, a guy in the back looks  up and sees me.  I also, there's photos of me and all my midnight express stuff on the wall, and this guy looks  and he comes rushing towards us, and my four cops go right into defense mode like this.  He says, oh, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.  Billy Hayes, Billy Hayes.  My father, turns out his father used to own the pudding shop way back then, and he said,  you wrote about pudding shop in your book, and they talked pudding shop in the movie. 
[03:22:00]  It made them so famous that they made so much money that they bought the hotel next door.  They profited from the fact that it was so weird.  So how much hash did you bring back that time?  I wish I had.  I wish I had.  That would have been hilarious.  What became of the guard, you know, the brutal guard?  In the movie, in midnight express, they've got this guy, me butting him, and he hits his  head on a spike, and you hear that sound effect, like, pshhh.  He's dead, yeah. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  He actually was killed by a fellow prisoner who, he'd beaten this guy.  They found some hash, and they grabbed this guy, and he was beating this guy, and he wanted  to know where he got the hash from.  And the guy said, Alada, from God.  Because, you know, if you tell where you got it, between a rock and a big hard place,  then the guys you got it from.  So this guy didn't say anything, and they beat his feet.  And I got beaten the first night because I got in a fight with this guy, which they didn't,  I thought they were killing me, but that wasn't a bad beating.  I mean, they didn't break any bones.  That's how you decide if it's a bad beating or not.  If it's a sharp beating.  And if they break bones and beat you for two or three days, that's a real bad beating. 
[03:23:00]  So they just wanted a lesson.  I was in there.  I got in the fight.  It was my first night.  Let's teach them a lesson.  So they beat my feet.  The good thing for me is I'd hit one of these trustees who started this thing with me,  and I'm not real big, but I was real fast and nasty back then.  Sir, how do they beat your feet?  They lay you down, take off your shoes, tie your feet up with a rope.  These two guys hold the rope out, and this guy whacks you with a stick.  The bottom of your feet.  It's called falaka.  It's common all throughout the Middle East.  I know you've got to go soon, but quickly, how did you escape?  I escaped. 
[03:23:30]  In the movie, it was like an afterthought.  They did something else.  It's one reason, again, I wanted to do the locked up abroad.  They gave me a chance to tell my real story about my first couple of trips and how I really escaped.  I got transferred to an island prison, and I was able to escape off the island in this little rowboat in a storm  and rode about 17 miles to the Asia Minor coast and spent the next three days running through Turkey and dying my hair,  and I made my way to the Greek border.  I ended up crossing this really wooded, hilly area, and it's a heavy military zone because they've been enemies for a thousand years, 
[03:24:00]  the Turks and Turks, and I was able to swim across the Maritas River.  I'm a swimmer.  I was a lifeguard and a surfer and all that bullshit, so that's easy.  The problem for me in the river was whether it's a Turkish bullet from this side or a Greek bullet from that side, I'm dead.  But you knew the Greeks wouldn't send you back.  I knew they would never send me back.  Again, they're enemies of the Turks.  I just did five years for hash, for those who don't know, is pot.  Same plant.  It's marijuana.  It's just processed.  A little stronger.  So five years.  Oh, it's much stronger.  Well, back then.  Now it's not.  The pot now is unbelievable. 
[03:24:30]  They would never send me back to Turkey, not for this crime, and I knew that.  They actually, I was wandering through the woods.  It was like 4.30 in the morning, and I was stoned out of my head from three days of not sleeping,  and the energy and the stuff, and I wandered past what turned out to be a little wooden kiosk, like an outhouse.  I didn't even see it.  It was a sentry booth, and I wandered past.  Suddenly, this bayonet came down in front of my face, and this guy screamed something.  I threw my arms in the air.  Natural reaction.  Somebody puts a bayonet in your face.  You stick your arms in the air, and this guy yelled something at me, and I didn't understand him. 
[03:25:00]  And he yelled something again, and I realized, I don't understand.  I speak good Turkish by now.  I don't understand him, which means he must be speaking Greek, which means this really is Greece.  I collapsed on the ground with my arms in the air.  There's a big grin on my face, which freaked him out.  All these soldiers came running around, and this one cop stuck his watch in front of the lights.  They had flashlights.  He says, four and a half.  It's four and a half at 4.30 in the morning.  Four and a half.  What are you doing here?  I said, I'm an American.  I just escaped from Turkey.  They kept me in a little room in the woods by the army base there for about 12 days while they decided my fate. 
[03:25:30]  But, you know, I can do 12 days.  I was five years.  I could be 12 days on my head knowing I'm going free.  Did your parents know at that point that you had gotten out of Turkey?  Not yet.  When did you first alert them?  When the American – I didn't, but the American council finally came out to the jail in the woods,  wherever the hell they had me, somewhere out near Thessalonica on the border.  And he then was able to contact my dad, who wired some money.  And the Greeks actually deported me as a bad influence upon the youth of Greece, 
[03:26:00]  which is the same crime they charged Socrates with.  Did not ask me to drink any hadlock, which is really nice.  And then they were nice to me, and they sent me off.  And the first place I flew to was Amsterdam, which I know if they're going to be free anywhere in the world,  it's Amsterdam.  I spent four days in Amsterdam sort of getting it together, and I dyed my hair blonde back there  because while I was in Istanbul, I dyed my own hair black, just trying to change my looks  because I had real blonde hair back then.  Did it fit in a little bit? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, yeah, fit in.  And, you know, Amsterdam, I got there.  I had my first meal on the outside, which was peach pancakes and a strawberry ice cream soda.  A little pot or what?  A little pot in Amsterdam?  You know, I was stoned, tripping on life, on everything.  You didn't need to do it at that point.  It would be superfluous.  I mean, sights and sounds and women and noise and dogs.  Just to be free again is such an amazing deal.  How long did you last the first time you get laid after getting out?  I got home to Long Island on a Friday, Saturday night.  My brother took me out to a big party in the Hamptons, and I'd become this little mini-celeb 
[03:27:00]  because literally it was the thing at the airport, you know, everybody knew.  And it was some big old house, and they had a balloon that they were giving guests rides in,  a tethered balloon that they would take up above the house.  And some woman in a white dress came around and said,  Billy, follow me.  And she took me into the little balloon, and they hit the things,  and the balloon lifted up above the house.  And I got a blowjob above this party in the Hamptons with 100 people down below.  So that was my first sex back home.  It was very good, too.  I quite enjoyed it. 
[03:27:30]  Do you know where she's at these days?  I wish.  But if you're out there, thank you very much.  There's a great picture of you in JFK, too, which you show at the end of the day.  I saw your thing, which was great.  You're locked up abroad, which airs, by the way.  When does it air?  What day is today?  Today, Wednesday?  Yeah.  Tonight, 10 o'clock.  Tonight at 10 o'clock.  It really is because there's a lot we couldn't cover here.  You have to watch.  Oh, absolutely.  It's fucking fascinating.  Yeah.  And there's a great picture of you and your dad in the airport, which I knew that meant 
[03:28:00]  a lot to you.  What was the first thing you said to him when you got out, when you were done?  I just, you know, I came down off the plane and there was some guy saying, Mr. Hayes,  Mr. Hayes, I'm thinking, oh, it's police.  And I'm going to get the fingerprinting.  I hate that ink on my hands.  I say, you're the police, I assume.  He said, oh, no, no.  I'm with Pan Am.  Please follow me.  He took me down some back stairs.  I didn't go through customs, which is interesting.  Had me thinking a little bit.  No, no, let's not think those things anymore.  And brought me down and there was my dad and my brother and my lawyer and we all hugged.  And my dad said, there's a couple of reporters here who want to talk to you. 
[03:28:30]  But, you know, we can slip out a side door if you don't want to talk.  I say, hey, I'm free.  People are pushing me around, telling me what to do for five years.  I'm free.  I don't need to slip out a side door.  I'll talk to anybody.  And they brought me up and these doors opened and suddenly all these lights came on and  cameras.  And there's a hundred reporters with microphones and cameras asking me all these questions, which  is that that photo is me.  If you notice, I got my arm around my dad's shoulder just for security, just to know.  And I had holding up the passport by black hair that I died.  After all that, what was the first thing you did in America? 
[03:29:00]  Back in America.  I drove out to Babylon to see my mom, which, you know, I hadn't seen in five years.  There were reporters out in front of the house, actually, in Babylon when we got there.  But, you know, I'm free now.  And it's life is good.  Life is really good.  And you still do a little of this?  I do as much of that as I can.  That's all I do.  I do yoga every day.  I got lucky.  I discovered yoga before I got busted.  So I've done yoga every day for 40 years, which pretty much keeps me healthy and reasonably  sane.  And I will take reasonably sane any day. 
[03:29:30]  And I smoke some weed if and when I can.  Well, what a great interview, man.  Billy, you're all right.  I could talk to you for hours.  Absolutely.  We know.  I love Sirius because you can say it the way it is.  It's just a joy.  And you guys are a treat.  And your stand-up show, by the way, kills me.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks very much.  It kills me.  It's so funny.  You should go down to Atlantic City.  He's going to be performing this weekend.  Good for him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go to Turkey and try to smuggle some hash, Jimmy.  Tape it under your arms, Jimmy.  They'll never search you there.  Yeah, all right.  So what's the big plug for Billy?  Tonight, it's a fast...  As great as a guest Billy was, you can only cover so much. 
[03:30:00]  Tonight, it is on at 10 o'clock?  Yeah, yeah.  National Geographic Channel, Locked Up Abroad.  Locked Up Abroad is one of the best series they do.  And this is the one that started it all.  This is the original.  And it's a fucking fascinating hour episode, man.  There's not one boring minute of it.  And just to imagine, not even imagine, that it's true.  Yeah.  And as you watch it, you go, this is better than a movie.  You know, because it really happened.  At the very least, it's a cautionary tale.  Yeah.  I have a lot of friends say, we force our teenage kids to watch Locked Up Abroad because they 
[03:30:30]  need to know this before they go out there.  Yeah.  Because they're probably still as stupid as I was back then.  And, you know, learn a lesson here.  Absolutely.  Thanks, guys.  As we go to break, Anthony, Larry King, you know, he's stepping down.  So the boys put together a little Larry King remembers.  Or we remember Larry King or whatever.  I remember you.  I don't know.  It's this.  I just wanted to know, what advice do you have, young people coming up into the field? 
[03:31:00]  For instance, experience, is that important?  Uh-huh.  Well, it's way up there.  It's way up there.  Pressure on the fire.  Done this before.  I don't want it to be his first surgery.  Plied himself well.  These are the things I'd have confidence in, a young MD.  I'm talking about journalism field.  I'm lost.  What do you mean?  How long have you been skateboarding? 
[03:31:30]  Some crazy whiplash.  About 20 years.  Why?  Oh, it's great fun.  I mean...  How important is the board?  Uh, the board's one of the main things.  The board, the shoes, the wheels.  This confession about how he killed Ron and Nicole, and he worked hard thinking that he  was going to make millions off of it.  Uh-huh.  And we snatched it right out from under him.  Are you getting any money, Nicole, from this at all?  Denise, no.  I'm not getting a dime.  I'm sorry, did I have to forgive me?  I will remember you.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles. 
[03:32:00]  The Mockley crew are back.  You work with him on Brokeback Mountain, right?  How did he approach that role?  He certainly was not gay.  Nancy Weiss, that child, what was the matter with that child?  Ricky saw the clip.  That was a typical child.  Okay, sorry.  What you noticed, that was a typical child, yes.  I thought it was an autism child.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today. 
[03:32:30]  All right, now that's not rap.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  I want to be a poet.  Come on.  New York.  New York.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on, wait on you.  You're hanging me out to dry.  Give it to the Jew every time.  Will you do another movie?  Who's asking?  Me.  For you now?  Did you hear the question, Carrie? 
[03:33:00]  Did she hear the question?  Is she leaving?  Was I asked what motivated the settlement?  Did you hear the question?  John, I can't hear you.  You took the mic off.  When you put the mic on, we can hear you.  Who are you talking to?  Hello?  Hello?  Joining Laurence Silver with us now is Deborah Tate, Roman Polanski's former sister-in-law,  the sister of the late Sharon Tate.  You ever talked to Roman Polanski?  I have.  How can you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister? 
[03:33:30]  Roman didn't murder my sister.  I mean, well, I'm sorry.  Was there ever a time in your life when you thought fear would overcome you?  I joined the Navy SEAL so I would conquer that fear.  Why didn't you join the parachutes?  Well, I was a paratrooper.  Oh, that's part of the Navy SEAL training?  SEAL means sea-air land, Larry.  The time I never attend is between me to the planet.  We'll be back with more.  Lou Ferragamo, lots to talk about, about Michael Jackson. 
[03:34:00]  I got a call from Layla Ali.  You know, she had no agenda.  She just was worried about me.  So you're talking about Muhammad Ali's wife?  No, sir, his daughter.  All right.  I said Ferragamo, I apologize.  He was a good quarterback.  We'll be back with Lou Ferragamo in a minute.  As I came out of the grocery store and got in my car, Phillip knocked on my window and  said, you know...  What happened when he got in?  Took my keys out, threw him on the floor, and pulled out handcuffs, and handcuffed me, 
[03:34:30]  and said it just on a piece of ass if he'd be good.  What did he do with the truth?  He put her on the floor, I guess.  Do you remember the movie A Few Good Men, where Jack Nicholson played that incredible  part?  Well, Stephen Lang did it on Broadway, and he was incredible with that great line, right?  You wouldn't know the truth.  You can't handle the truth.  Private memorial service for the family.  Are they aware that this is the July 4th weekend?  Yeah, Larry, I think the point that they've reached the point that they want to give him 
[03:35:00]  that proper burial, and it just happens to be the July 4th weekend.  Lasted how long?  Nine years.  180 episodes.  You gave it up, right?  I did.  They didn't cancel you.  You canceled them.  You're not aware of this?  No, I'm asking you.  You think I got canceled?  Are you under the impression that I got canceled?  Have I hurt you, Jerry?  Larry, I went off the air.  I was the number one show on television, Larry.  You were on the show.  Do you know who I am?  Cool it.  Life is a breeze.  Of course, some breezes, as you know, are 110 miles an hour and get promoted up to hurricanes. 
[03:35:30]  I just thought I'd pass that along.  Wow.  Who put that?  Great job.  Huh?  Derek.  Derek.  Fucking A.  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  Fucking D-Boy is a talented little drunk shitting asshole.  That is great.  Shitting asshole.  He's a gifted sot.  Larry King getting fired is going to really hurt this radio show.  It's going to hurt this fucking show.  Did you see Sam wiping his eyes?  Yeah, I see that.  I think Sam was a little teared up about that whole thing.  God, what are we going to do without Larry King to kick around, man?  That sucks. 
[03:36:00]  God damn.  Well, we could play that 20 more times.  And we will.  Because that is classic.  Also, Billy Hayes.  Holy crap.  It was great.  What a great interview.  Great interview.  The guy is...  We've got to get him back just to hang, because I'm sure he has other stories to tell.  Yeah.  Other stories.  He has a play or something he's doing, too.  When he comes back to promote that, he will definitely be back on the show.  So, Jimmy's got a big interview today.  Well, yeah.  I did it already, but it's playing today at 11 a.m. on The Boneyard.  It's my Ozzy interview.  And we wrap it around with some production.  I come out and I play songs, but I don't pretend I'm segwaying from the interview. 
[03:36:30]  Like, all right, Oz, we're going to play 11 a.m.  Oh, you should have done that.  I tried.  It sounded terrible.  They went in another direction.  Yeah.  Another direction with this one, Jimmy.  No, but Troy told me, he goes, you might want to do the rap.  And I like doing this.  And Gary actually said, it's more honest just to do it like this, right?  All right, look, we're out of the interview now.  Yeah.  We're going to play a song off the new CD.  I like doing that.  Mike Parrish called me at home last night to tell me how great the interview was.  Yeah, it went well, man.  Because it's through FMQB, right?  And the regular radio got about 25 minutes of interview and then plus commercials and stuff. 
[03:37:00]  And this is the whole hour interview.  And it's going to be at the Boneyard.  11 a.m.  Right after the show.  Shit.  Just to...  We just chit chat.  I can't listen.  You know, there's me and my pals.  Can I get a disc of that?  Yeah, there's...  Yeah, sure.  MGMT is performing today at 11.  I'm fucking checking that out.  I'm not going home today.  I got to check those guys out.  By the time they're done, I'll still be talking to fucking Oz.  You know, two pals hang out, talk.  Sure.  Of similar ilk.  He was very conversational and very...  He was amazing to talk to. 
[03:37:30]  And I'm not messing up your plug, by the way.  But MGMT is performing for a later date thing, so...  Oh, it's not...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I didn't mean to step on you a little bit with the...  No, no, no, no.  Because we want people to check out your interview with Ozzy.  Okay, good, good, good.  And what do you got over there?
