<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a detailed discussion of their upcoming roadshow at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island.  The hosts hyped the event, listing performers such as Jim Florentine, Stephen Lynch (who debuted a new, offensive verse to his "Special Olympics" song), Fuel, and the band Q Farts.  They also mentioned appearances by Mistress Rhiannon, Melissa (who had an affair with their general manager, Ken Stevens), and Kat from their boot camp.  Pete Radovich from NBC was providing an XFL highlight reel, possibly a blooper reel of Opie and Anthony themselves. The show promised a wet t-shirt dunk tank, a lesbian couch, and potentially controversial content, including a video featuring "Century Sex." Anthony announced a planned performance with his band, including a John Travolta-inspired Disco Inferno act and a song featuring his brother's use of the C-word.

A significant segment focused on the Abner Louima case and his $9 million settlement, with the hosts making numerous offensive comments about Louima's appearance.  Callers weighed in, debating offensive hypothetical scenarios involving money and sexual acts.  Discussions also included a song called "Critters on My Crackers" and the hosts' "Wow" stickers. A substantial portion detailed and played audio of the previous day's segment where they threw darts at "Annoying Laugh Anthony's" back, resulting in injury and bleeding.  They discussed the incident's aftermath, including arranging for more plugs for his limo service. A call from "Limo Anthony" confirmed his injuries and his planned roadshow appearance.  A live report revealed a "stalker," Patty, waiting outside the venue.

The show briefly touched upon a discussion involving a son and a phone number (1-800-GO-VITAL), before returning to Anthonyâ€™s dart injury. A caller suggested the nicknames "Anthony Pincushion" or "Corky."  The hosts mentioned a "worst of show" replay planned for Saturday and discussed Brian Regan's cancelled appearance due to weather, promising his appearance the following day.  After promoting other WNEW programs, they introduced a new sponsor, WhippedCreamBikini.com, and upcoming contests: a "best ass" contest (with a Las Vegas trip prize, sponsored by Gear Magazine and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed) and a future "whipped cream bikini" contest.

A large segment covered a news story about a Rutgers University man who tricked women into removing their shoes to fondle their feet. Callers, including Rutgers students, shared opinions and experiences, recounting similar incidents. The discussion included graphic descriptions and jokes about foot-fondling and other sexual acts, with callers detailing frightening personal experiences involving strangers and toe-sucking incidents. The conversation broadened to various sexual acts and fetishes. A caller, Greg, hinted at a personal fetish, prompting an unresolved guessing game.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about hair dyeing and then played audio detailing a graphic sexual encounter involving whipping and kicking.  Following commercial breaks for Rothman's Men's Clothing, Nexbell wireless, and Avacor hair treatment, the show featured an XFL game day blooper reel slated for the roadshow.  Further promotion of the roadshow highlighted the "best ass" contest, with a brief interview and mention of photos of contestant Myra.  A segment discussed the Olsen Twins' supposedly sexually suggestive songs, playing a clip of "Come As You Are." More commercial breaks for WhippedCreamBikini.com and Stacker 2 fat burner preceded more roadshow promotion, emphasizing multimedia aspects and the appearance of Pete from QFARP and his brownies, along with other acts. Melissa, a former XFL Game Day host, was in studio and briefly discussed her experiences.  The hosts reiterated their anticipation, mentioning a disco opener and a performance of the "Marsha Brady" song.  The show concluded with listener calls and further roadshow promotion, along with a mention of Brian Regan's appearance the next day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Look at that, Opie. We continue to be an award-winning show.  Who does the voting? Because, are they on heroin?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're on comedies, we're on fiction. It's fabulous.  1027.  The U.S. Show. 
[00:00:30]  Now we're having fun.  Take your balls out.  Clap your ass up.  Clap your throat up.  It's your dad. 
[00:01:00]  I was made happy and it was birthday.  And it's not even more.  No problemo.  It looks like a moron.  It's in the home.  Good girl.  That's a little mad.  Right off the bat, someone's mad at us?  Yeah, we haven't even uttered a word.  You ass-ass make me sit, says Matt from New York. 
[00:01:30]  You have the balls to rip Springsteen for singing about the Diallo murder, but you have no problem playing those jerk-off C-Rags rage.  F to them and the Beasties support that effing animal that killed the cop in Philly.  You are the biggest effing hypocrites on the air.  Spineless pieces of effing animal that killed the cop in Philly.  It's a song, man.  Just playing the tune.  Stinky picked it. 
[00:02:00]  It's a song, man.  And I don't think that song is about a cop being killed.  I think the Springsteen song is about the Diallo thing.  You know, if you want to look into it, every band you listen to has a cause.  Has some kind of a wacky cause.  What do you think?  We support Rage Against the Machine's cause?  No, I like being part of the machine at times.  I mean, give me a break.  But they rock.  That guy's all pissed off.  Like any time anybody plays it. 
[00:02:30]  Hey, it's a tune.  It kind of rocks.  Every song you listen to, do you look into what the musicians in that band stand for?  And what beliefs they have?  I'm sure you wouldn't be able to listen to anything.  And who are we?  There are people that enjoy Rage Against the Machine, so we throw it on every once in a while.  Right.  We've expressed what we thought about Rage and the Beastie Boys.  We had a whole discussion about it.  Bruce Springsteen, we've talked about that.  But now we can only play songs from artists we support in politics and whatnot. 
[00:03:00]  We smashed the Bruce Springsteen CDs a while ago.  Because quite frankly, I don't like Bruce Springsteen's music.  Yeah, because it sucks.  If it rocked, who cares about what it does?  If it rocked, we would give him, you know, a talking to.  And then we'd play some of his stuff.  I'm sick of Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah.  Completely sick of his stuff.  212-757-1027.  What a day.  This is the day. 
[00:03:30]  Yes.  It's Roadshow Day.  We're just a few short hours away from the O&A Roadshow.  First one in quite a while.  On Long Island.  At the Vanderbilt in Plainview.  Yeah.  Direction's on the website, WNAW.com.  People are already on their way.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be like a tailgate thing, I think.  Even with this lousy weather.  The Nor'easter that we have, Opie.  You know, this is a Nor'easter. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, I know it's a Nor'easter because my train was 10 minutes late.  Yeah.  What does rain have to do with trains?  I can kind of understand snow.  That's a good question.  When I was watching the news, Long Island Railroad, 10 to 15 minute delays everywhere because of the Nor'easter.  And if you're driving, leave a little extra time to get there.  Because people don't know how to drive in the rain.  I swear. 
[00:04:30]  In the stolen Lexus that I drive every day, Opie.  You still haven't given that back?  No.  Remember the other day?  Do you remember the other day when the sales guy came in and I said, yeah, I'm giving it back tomorrow?  Yeah, but you've got to give it back.  You've got to know the problem.  What's the matter?  Is it still in the garage downstairs?  I've been driving it.  So it's, I'm not going to say where it is.  Because people are yelling at me that your car has been in the garage too long.  I'm like, I have nothing to do with Anthony's life.  Who said that?  You know, somebody. 
[00:05:00]  Somebody.  First of all, the thing was there for the weekend.  They're bitching to me.  I'm like, I don't.  Well, I want people to come to me and bitch to me about it because I've been driving the thing.  I'm not in charge of Anthony's life.  The guy, someone is like, you know, can tell Anthony to get the car out of here, blah, blah, blah.  Did they sound like that?  Right.  Or did they sound like, tell Anthony to get the car out of the lot, man.  Anyway, so we have a road show today.  Yeah.  I just thought Jamaican, Mike.  Ben is on his way to the venue.  He should be checking in very, very soon. 
[00:05:30]  He's kind of our probe.  We sent Ben to kind of check out the scene.  Scope it out.  He'll be the first one calling in from the scene.  Let us know what the vibe is like.  Now, we have an action-packed show.  Obviously, it's going to take us a while to get there, but the festivities will begin right at 7.  There will be things going on on that stage starting right at 7 o'clock.  They start without us.  Including music and comedy and videos.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Doors open at 6, I believe.  21 and older. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  Which will be strictly enforced.  Ab so effing lutely.  Road show tonight.  Jim Florentine.  He's going to do some time on the stage.  Stephen Lynch, who came in here yesterday and gave us a couple new ditties that were really, really funny.  A new line to the Special Olympics song.  You know, we can blow that out right now.  Like penning an extra line on a Beatles song.  That song is so legendary.  Yeah, it was kind of weird because we've all heard Special Olympics a million times.  I still love the song every time I hear it.  But you're right. 
[00:06:30]  It usually ends after that first verse.  But Lynch finally added a second verse.  Yeah.  And you know what?  It killed.  Here's Lynch from yesterday.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Watch them laugh. 
[00:07:00]  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool that's diving.  At the Special Olympics.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell.  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball gotta be about the funniest friggin' thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:07:30]  Olympics.  At the Special Olympics.  At the Special Olympics.  Verse 2.  Kid with Downs.  Kid with Downs.  Ends the race.  Even though he stood in place.  Olympics.  Olympics.  Olympics.  Round his neck.  Gold medals hung. 
[00:08:00]  Resting on his giant tongue.  Olympics.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh my goodness.  I don't know.  But I kid when I sing.  Because these games are a beautiful thing  Okay, really, I'm just avoiding karma  Because I know my children could be born crippled and blind  And the next time I retire, I'll have to spend all my time 
[00:08:30]  At the special end of the room  Bravo!  I feel so guilty, I can't even tell you  That's pretty, yeah, you should  I should  And there you have it  Stephen Lynch from yesterday  The second verse of this special Olympics song  Will he be playing that song tonight at the roadshow?  The extended version  The EP  We don't know what he has planned  It's up to him  But he'll be doing a couple songs tonight  Fuel's coming down to do a couple songs  Fuel  The gang from Q Farts 
[00:09:00]  These guys are sick apps  And we're going to get them to do some crazy things on the stage  With the crew from Ibetyouwill.com  I don't want to fire you not to  Turn your head away from the stage  Because you will be so disgusted by some of their hijinks  He can't look  And is Pete bringing the brownies?  Oh  Oh  Did you talk to Pete about the brownies?  That was Ben  But did Ben talk to him?  I think so, yeah  Good  No, no  I cannot even be close to that  The bag of brownies may come out tonight 
[00:09:30]  It's a showstopper  I'm hearing something about a severed pig head too  But that's all I can say  Oh, no  Come on  Put a little sandwich bag filled with brownies  I guess it'll be a surprise  We really don't know if he's got the  Well, we know he has the you-know-what to bring it  But we'll see  Well, I know when he pulled that out of his back pocket  Here in the studio one day  He was pounced on it  It looked like 
[00:10:00]  It looked like  It looked like the Reagan shooting  Exactly  Yeah  Why did we have to beat him up?  Just because he pulled out a bag of brownies  All of a sudden he was wrestled to the ground  We didn't beat him up  We just escorted him away from the studio  Soundry Steve roughed him up  Because that's Steve's job though  Steve used to do that in a past life  What if he would have hurled that bag?  Steve thought it was a gun  That one of us  Worse than a gun in some ways  Plastique  Worse than a gun  Plastique  It was a C4 
[00:10:30]  C4  That was putty  I play siphon filter  All right  I know what C4 is  That was disgusting  What if he would have thrown it at you?  Then you'd have been going  Steve, why didn't you have him thrown out  When he pulled that out of his pocket  He threw crap at me like a monk  You have to have trust, my friend  Pete's not going to throw it at us  He's a sick F  And he'll disturb a lot of people  But he's not going to throw feces at us  Yeah  I have confidence in Pete  He'd have it on his hands and his face 
[00:11:00]  And they'd want to take pictures of us  You know  Hey, let me put my arm around you  Like we're buddies  Like we're crap buddies  Good job, Steve  Also, Mistress Rhiannon will be there  With her boobo lanterns  Booobo lanterns  Very, very funny thing  That you'll get to check out tonight  We're flying Melissa up from Philadelphia  Yeah, remember her?  She used to intro us for the XFL Game Day show  And she's sleeping with our general manager, Ken Stevens  Ken Stevens  Those two are in a torrid affair 
[00:11:30]  She has nothing better to do  Because Ken's on vacation  So we're like  Might as well come up and hang out with us  Why is Ken on vacation  If he's got that  Like on the side here  He's got to throw his wife a bone  Every once in a while  Is that what it is?  Oh yeah  Keep the marriage together  But then he can get back  You've got to keep the wife happy  What?  Where'd he go on vacation?  I think he's shocked  You think he's buying some souvenirs  For Melissa  And then telling his wife  No, you know  This is for some  A friend at the office 
[00:12:00]  Secretary  Secretary  We'll ask him when he comes back  I'm sure he'll deny the whole thing  Once again  But we know better  We've seen the body glitter  Our boss is having an affair  Horrid  With hot Melissa  Going through that midlife crisis  Thank you  What's wrong with you?  You're not as brave as you used to be  No, I'm just laughing at something else  Yeah  Also Kat, our boot camp  Will be there  Pete Radovich from NBC  Is coming down with an XFL highlight tape  Yeah  I think it's our blooper reel 
[00:12:30]  He's going to make fun of us  Pretty good tonight  Good  Yeah, I talked to him earlier today  And he says it's coming out very nicely  Good  Can't wait to see it  He's got nice music set to it  It should be a moving experience  He is an editing genius  Yeah  When it comes to that  So the music, I guess  Will be a good part of it  Oh, of course  Also, we have the wet t-shirt dunk tank  The lesbian couch  And I've been told  That I can't bring century sex  Can we call him?  We've got to call and ask  Call and ask about century sex 
[00:13:00]  I need an answer immediately  Okay  Because, I mean, I know you can't have hardcore sex going on live in a club  But, you know, they've got HBO  In bars, you go there and you look and you're watching real sex  And they're showing sex act on TV in a bar  So I think TV or video is a lot different  Well, there's nothing erotic about this, first of all  No, it's a freak show  The guy never got you-know-what to get the job done  No  He got halfway there  That was the best he could muster up in front of a 100-year-old naked lady 
[00:13:30]  Well, if the crypt people were sucking your seat  I don't think you'd be able to perform either  But we've talked about the video many times on the show  And we want to, like, show about 1,500 people the video tonight  Yeah  So can you call them and see if it's cool?  Let's see  Well, even, like, you know, queue it up to a place that's kind of in a safe zone  Where she's only given a handy  Yeah  That's even worse  It's not what she's doing  When she's doing the BJ thing  And it's just this big skull with latex stretched over it 
[00:14:00]  Because that's what she looks like  Making that mouth  And just bobbing  Yeah  Oh, my God  Same way she did it for the Civil War troops, I'm sure  And we have many more surprises  Anthony's band's going to perform a few numbers  We'll do a few, a few  You know, like the old gag  We're getting the band back together, man  You're getting the band together  You know, and we do some of the parody things like 
[00:14:30]  Marshall Brady  And I hear my brother actually went out and got the old John Travolta suit  For the huge disco opener number  Oh, big  Remember Disco Inferno?  Oh, God  Do you remember Disco Inferno?  I remember your version of it  Where I actually come out in the three-piece suit  And proceed to do many of the dance moves  Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever made famous  Thank you  Will you have an afro on or something?  I have cut my hair off since the old days  But I do have a huge afro wig 
[00:15:00]  That I believe will just set off the outfit  So you're not doing Naked Cowboy?  No, I'll do Naked Cowboy  The real way?  Yeah  Yeah  No way  I'll do it  No way  Get enough beer in me, I'll do anything  No way  I don't care  I'll spank a batch out into the crowd like a chimp  You will not  Let's go over this  You will do Naked Cowboy in your tighty-whities  Right  That's what I do it in  I do it in the tighty-whities  That's all you're wearing  I shove my boxer shorts down the front 
[00:15:30]  And I have a cowboy hat and boots  Big fag cowboy hat  And a bandana  And I sing Naked Cowboy  Just like the old days  Right  You are not doing that tonight  Alright  There's no way you're doing that tonight  We'll see  There's no way  We'll see  I can't wait to see this  And then we cap it off with  I want to party on your  See  Gotcha  Is your brother going to do the C song?  Oh yeah  He's actually got the tuxedo and everything 
[00:16:00]  Because the crowd loves chiming in  With the C word  Your brother's going to be doing some stuff  Right at 7, right?  With another band?  Yeah  Mr. Potato Head  Mr. Potato Head  So go in and hear some Hendrix and stuff  Get there early  It's going to be a crazy scene tonight  We haven't done a road show in 8 to 10 months I think  Yeah  About 10 months  The last one was in Island Park  That was the last official road show we ever did  So get there  It's the Vanderbilt in Plainview 
[00:16:30]  Doors open at 6  You've got to be 21 or over  Yes  That will be strictly enforced  I'm warning you guys now  Their rules, not ours  It's probably there isn't a height restriction  All right, we're going to take a break  Yikes  Another song that Stephen Lynch performed on our show  A brand new song as we go to break  And we'll take your calls at 212-757-1027  We'll do that next  All right, this is for the ladies  Here we go  I made love to you all night long 
[00:17:00]  And I got up to write you a song  I watched you sleep and I fell in love  You must have been sent from heaven above  Don't think you could never do no wrong  Then you farted  Oh girl, you farted  First I thought that it was kind of cute 
[00:17:30]  I suppressed a smile when I heard your girly poot  But then the smell came a-wafting by  And brought a little teardrop to my eye  I think that I'll go sleep out on the couch  Could you fart in?  It can make milk curdle 
[00:18:00]  Make your skin crawl  Make the paint peel off of the wall  It won't sleep under them covers no more  Since the hot wind's blue from out your back door  Baby, it sure has been a guess  But I can't live life with fear enough to ask  Though I gathered up my clothes and my old dog Bill  Moved back to my house at the top of the hill 
[00:18:30]  Well, oh boy, I guess it's just you and me  Then he farted  Thank you, thank you very much  Stephen Lynch will be at Governor's in two hours in Levittown  That's right  It's another Opie and Anthony Rhodes show tonight  At the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island  Stores open at 6  O&A will be there after the show  21 and older only  Get directions and other info on WNWD.com

Would you take 9 million bucks to get a broom handle up your back door? 
[00:22:00]  I was thinking about that today  I mean, I'm just thumbing through the, uh, daily news  You know, the Abner Louima thing?  You remember him  How bad could it be?  9 mil  Now, you're going to get 9 million dollars  9 million dollars  To get a broom handle put there  Is he able to, uh, guess he's okay?  I would definitely take the 9 mil  You would take 9 mil  Yes  To get a broom handle  Yes  Kind of slammed in there 
[00:22:30]  Yes  And then  As long as I don't need a bag to crap  Yes  I think, uh, Volpe did wipe  It on his mouth  After he pulled it out  You'd have to add an extra mil for that at least  Well, he's only getting 9 mil  Only?  Only  Well, you know, compared to some other stuff  How much was this guy making before he got the, the broom handle?  Not 9 mil  Maybe 9 bucks an hour  He's going to need 8 mil of that just for chapstick  Jesus Christ  Every time I see a picture of this guy 
[00:23:00]  What are you saying, Anthony?  What are you saying?  I'm saying that Abner Louima's got the hugest lips I've ever seen on a human being  Now, I believe that's a racist statement  No, because, I mean, even black people  Someone is going to call up and say you're racist because you said that  Even black people have to look and say that his lips are huge  Look, here's a picture of him right side up, right?  Mm-hmm  Now, look at his lips upside down  It's the same thing  There's not any difference from his upper lip to his lower lip  Looks like a puffy vag 
[00:23:30]  It does  When you turn that sideways, look at that  Dude, if you just cut that out, you would never know that wasn't vag  Here come the calls now, I'm telling you  What?  Very racist to say he has big lips  Can't say stuff like that  Does he?  Does he?  You can't, you can't point out the obvious  Okay, but does he?  There's a comedian  Yeah, he has very big lips  That's right  I don't care if he was green  There's a comedian, I think it's Carlos Mencia that's been on our show  Yeah  He goes, the reason why, you know, people say that black people like fried chicken 
[00:24:00]  Is because black people like fried chicken  And what is wrong with that?  What is wrong with pointing out the obvious?  It is pointing out the obvious  Some people call it stereotypes, though  And stereotype  But a stereotype, I don't think  When you say Abner Louima has big lips  You're stereotyping  I'm looking at him  And they are huge  Even for a black man  That, I guess, if you've looked at 
[00:24:30]  Tend to have larger lips  Than, say, white people  I'm not saying all  But what I am saying is Abner Louima's got some big lips  And they love focusing on it  I'm turning it sideways  Look, it's a bag  Josh  Yo  Hey, Josh  What's up, man?  Let's go  You're on the show  Yo, Abner Louima, just to let you know  He does have some big lips 
[00:25:00]  But he does wear a bag  Nine million dollars  Ain't worth it  What, he's got to wear a bag?  He's got the bag  I read it in a paper not too long ago  So he can't crap right?  Then bet's off  He's got to wear an S-bag, man  That ain't the way to go  There's not enough money in this world  To, you know  To have that happen to you  Look, I think he was wearing it  While he was healing up  But I think that  They fixed it  Well, if they fixed it  Then that's another story  But, hey, I don't know  What about that?  What? 
[00:25:30]  You've got to bag it for a limited time  Limited tax  Limited time bag?  A limited bag  And then they hook you back up  To the proper plumbing  And no problems after that?  No  It's nine million, man  You're going to have a, you know  Who gets the chance to make nine million?  Not many people  I don't think I would do it  Not even for nine mil  Maybe if I was destitute, you know  You're on the street  What do you think?  You wouldn't have to work  Another day in your life  Don't work now  I'm talking about the 
[00:26:00]  I'm talking about like  People waiting for us  Well, I think everyone's got to base it  On their own situation  That's why I said  If I was destitute  I'm a street person or something  Or I'm in a really crappy  Low-paying job  Then maybe I'd consider it  Right  All right  But, boy  The stick  Tommy  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey  Listen, everybody's got their price  Forget about the bag, Anthony  But, how much money would you have to take  Just to take the broomstick anally? 
[00:26:30]  Oh, how much?  Let's say in front of a crowd of a hundred people  It makes you window  Can I put a price tag on you?  Everybody's got a price  All right  A price?  I'd say nine million  I would do it in a second  For nine mil?  Let me take that  It would take me  One million dollars  What?  I would sit in front of Macy's window  And take that  As long as I don't have to do the bag  For a million bucks  You would sit in front of an audience  And actually have someone poke you?  Yeah, but you're talking about a million dollars  I'm a union car 
[00:27:00]  But it takes me 20 years  To earn a million dollars  All right  I would say  One hundred million dollars  I'm talking tax-free  A hundred million?  For a hundred million  Yeah, then I'd do it  I got my price  I'm a whore  Tommy, you would do it for a mil?  I would do it for a million dollars  You're cheap  That's a little low  Tax-free, cash, million dollars  Oh, now you're talking  I'm not talking about how bad he got it  With the bag and everything else  Now you're talking tax-free  Yeah  Tax-free  That's kind of like two mil then  But also  I don't want to have to be  You know, dumping it into a bag 
[00:27:30]  For the rest of my life either  No, the bag thing  I'm talking about a broomstick  One time  On TV  I'd do it for a million  The bag thing brings it to a whole new level  A million?  Oh, yeah, yeah  I mean, who got a million?  Didn't the last survivor get a million bucks?  Yeah  Jesus  He's got a million  Tax-free million  You know, you're pretty much set  If you do the right thing  He just gives it away  On his TV show  And those people just got to answer questions  You're willing to take that?  Yeah  That's the final answer  You know what?  You're going to be kidding me  Tommy, a million dollars 
[00:28:00]  Doesn't go as far as you think  Listen  Anthony, a hundred million  You're probably  Gellman, get the broomstick, Gellman  Get the broomstick, Gellman  No, a hundred  For a hundred million  I'm going to say  You've got to go lower than that  I know you'd go lower  I would go much lower than that  But a million I think is too low  I think you're low-balling now  Yeah, you know what?  Maybe a million isn't what it used to be  But still  If you're thinking about it  You definitely have to  Think it over  Why?  What are you doing?  Why?  Because this is like  You know what this is like?  This is like the guy that had the fantasy  With the ladies at the house 
[00:28:30]  And he said  Can I bring my wife  And ruin the fantasy?  Right  No one's going to give you  Ten million dollars  Nine million dollars  To do this  So you might as well jack it up  To a hundred million  Like I did  I'm just being honest  A hundred million  I'd say one hundred million dollars  Alright, well I'm taking a million  If anybody's offering it out there  I'll go to the front of Maisie  Tommy, it could be the greatest radio bid ever  I think we could collect a mill  If we didn't get a million up  I'll be there  I think we could have a fundraiser  We could get a million dollars cash  And we'd bring you in, man  You signed all sorts of paperwork 
[00:29:00]  And we'll do that  You might get to wear a bag on my head  You know we're sick enough to try it  Can we throw darts at you, too?  Hey, glory  Can't use the S word  That's all right  Bye, Tommy  Bye, guys  Take it easy  Bye  Dan from Hoboken says  I'm in for ten grand  And Frank from East Windsor  Nine million  I'll set the wiffle ball bat record  Up my A  See, and I knew this was going to happen  And there is definitely a difference  Between the two  But I'll humor Joe  Go ahead, Joe  Hey, guys 
[00:29:30]  How about in front of Macy's  Give an oral  To a 300-pound black guy  With a 12-inch lung  Answer  No money  Not enough money in the world  There's not money  Not enough money in the world?  No, there's no money  I think I might have to do that  For a hundred mil  Two different things  I knew someone was going to come up with that  Getting a broom handle up your butt  Really hard  There's nothing sexual about it  There's not  Absolutely  But you think of it like  You know, you do it real quick  You gain a hundred million dollars  Oh, man 
[00:30:00]  You know what I mean?  No good?  No, sorry  No good  You're trying to trick us  No deal  All right  Because if we said a billion dollars  Yeah, you know  A billion dollars  You're still a sea sucker  There you go  All right, Joe  All right, guys  Take it easy  Bye  Let's go to Rudy  Rudy, what's going on?  Rudy  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man  Good  Hey, listen  I don't know how many of your listeners  That are like 40 years old  But, you know  When you got to get your prostate checked every year

[00:32:30]  Nine million dollars, man  You guys, you can't be greedy  Nine million's a lot of money  Yeah, but look at what you're getting  For nine mil  I'd say I'd go for that  I'd let him shovel it in  Bristle ends first  That's a lot of cash  Bristle ends first, man  And the janitor who's doing it  Can include one of his arms  Nine million  You learn to live with it  And you know you do, man  If the bag is actually an advantage  Because for that kind of money 
[00:33:00]  You hire bodyguards  You go to a fashion show  Just empty the bag  And throw it at some runway model  How nice would that feel?  Oh, wonderful  That's a nice moist  Yamside log  And some runway model  Stoodly emaciated face  Wouldn't that be pleasing  On a certain level of the man?

Gotta make sure his back's okay  I was talking to him  And he said he can't really feel his left arm  What do you mean he can't feel his left arm?  He says one of us nailed him right in the muscle  Yeah  That is affecting his whole left arm  It couldn't have gone that deep  That was a skim hanger  If you missed yesterday's show  We were throwing darts at Annoying Laf Anthony's back 
[00:45:00]  For plugs for his limo company  Yeah  1-800-GO-VITAL  Right  And  There's another one  He's got one left  Well, no, he gets to do them  That was a freebie, if he's listening  Right  And we drew blood  Anthony's shot drew blood  Yeah, I kind of lobbed one into his shoulder blade  See, I thought I was throwing him higher  But your technique was better  You, like, arced one  Nailed him in the shoulder blade  It went, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah  And then fell out  Yeah, and then it immediately started bleeding 
[00:45:30]  Bleeding a lot  Then I went for one of the love handles  That was really funny  Yeah  Boy, that was a good aim, though  Because I knew where you were going  And you laid it right into his love handle  That was funny  It bounced off  But it hit enough where I  It hurt him  He took five darts  Yeah  He took one to the love handle  He took three to, like, the shoulder blade area  On the left side  Yeah  And he took one in the A  In the A  Yeah, Rick threw one in his 
[00:46:00]  At his A  From point-blank range, by the way  Yeah, because Rick was holding the mic  So he reached around and just  Woof  And right when Ope threw his last start  Rick threw one at his ass  So he got hit twice  Right  And now he's hurting  He says he's having trouble with his left arm  Yeah  Yeah, he's all bruised and sore  I said, hey, man  There's a good possibility  We chipped your shoulder blade  It couldn't have gone that deep  I don't know, man  The blood was pretty bad 
[00:46:30]  It ruined his shirt  Yeah, because he had the white t-shirt on  And it was just dripping blood  I guess we got a video of that  We're going to show everyone tonight  At the road show  Yeah, you can watch  As he gets darts thrown at him  At the Vanderbilt in Plainview  Rick's trying to get him on the phone  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Actually, I'm friends with Al the cop  I work with him  Oh, cool  Yeah, today in the night beat  It has all the bands and stuff  All the big venues  Like Mulcahy's and the Vanderbilt  It says the Chippendales are there tonight  At 6 o'clock 
[00:47:00]  Where?  The Vanderbilt?  At the Vanderbilt, yeah  I think Al called  Check without cowbell bill  I think he knows about it  It's in the paper  It says the Chippendales at 6 o'clock  At the Vanderbilt  That was a clever ruse  Yeah, that was something  They planned a long time ago  But they canceled that for us  Because, you know, I didn't want to go  And see no, you know  Manly  Man and  Hey, hey  Enough with the S word, my friend  Thank you  All right, guys  Thank you, Brian  I think it's pretty good, though  That it's in there  Because ladies that don't listen 
[00:47:30]  To this show  Might think that the Chippendales are there  Everyone that listens  Knows it's going to be us down there  Yeah  And you might get some ladies  Now, if there's a long line  Trying to get into  The Vanderbilt tonight  We will comb the line  And make sure  We get a lot of ladies in there  Yeah, so bring your gal with you  So that's a little secret weapon  If you think  Oh, no  I'm running a little late  Bring a woman  Right  We'll give you another chance  To get in  Stay gay  I just need to play that audio 
[00:48:00]  As we try to get  Knowing left, Anthony  If he's listening  Please call the show  We want to make sure you're okay  Yeah, he's going to call  But here's the audio from yesterday  You want to set this up, Anthony?  Really fast?  Well, you know how Anthony's always coming in  And wanting to plug his various limo ventures that he's got going  We said we'd give him plugs if we could throw darts at his back  So we kind of covered up his spine with some rolled up newspaper and duct tape  Put him in the corner  Stood, I don't know, five, six, seven feet away 
[00:48:30]  And threw darts at his back  And they stuck in  And he really went for this  I was stunned when he agreed to do it  I really was  I was not expecting him to agree to do it  But we had fun with it  The first shot was a little light  The second one, though, drilled  Right into his shoulder  It was kind of fun, too, wasn't it?  Yeah  I mean, it's really sick  But it was kind of fun 
[00:49:00]  I was giggling like a schoolgirl all the way home on the railroad  I was just  Every few minutes I was just thinking about it  It was hilarious  So, all right, here's the audio from yesterday, okay?  Three, two, one  You winged that  Did he get the same?  He threw blood  I didn't draw blood  And it didn't stink  I didn't wing it  Wait, wait, hold on 
[00:49:30]  Hold on  Come here  Hold on  You can slide all those knights over now  Holy  What happened?  Where'd he go?  Hold on  Get him back in here  What did he get all mad at?  Get back in here  All right, coming back in here  You drew blood  You drew blood  And he threw it really hard  And it was two of them  You threw it at the same time  I didn't throw  He shot five of them at you  Anthony  I swear to you  I did not throw another dart  I threw two darts  Who threw the other dart? 
[00:50:00]  I don't know  Someone else in the room  Mitch  He's blaming Mitch  I want to throw one  I want him to throw one  I didn't get to  Let me see  Pull the shirt down  So we can see the  No  No, I'm serious  Let me see  It's a hole  Let's see the actual wound  Yeah, we got to see the actual wound  I don't want to take my back  Well, just pull the shirt up or something  Pull it  I can't  I'm all complaining  Just take the duct tape out  Let the prisoner go, Rick 
[00:50:30]  He's sweating  You're free  You're free  He's probably sitting here  A lot of throwing thoughts  He's not going to have hatred on me  All right  So how many plugs  I get ten plugs  And I'll pick and choose  When I want to use them  Wait, there was not ten  Ten?  There's no way  Five for Anthony's stick in one  How many plugs have you done already?  Two  Two  So five plus the one I did  Six  And we'll give you an extra one  For that other person  That threw it at your butt  So seven plugs 
[00:51:00]  Okay  There you go  Well done  And number one  I'm very impressed  We will play those plugs  On the Sunday night show  Go through the back  And there you have it  From yesterday  What a nut  That is so much cooler  Than throwing bagels  Isn't it?  Who would agree to do that?  Well, Anthony  We have the guy  That would agree  To do that  On the phone  Oh  But first, Mike  Mike, what's up?

Well, sure  But there's nude women walking around everywhere in this place  Some guys get really into checking out the feet though  I guess  It was absolutely unbelievable to me  The strippers are on their feet all day  So they've probably got the big taluses and stuff  You know  They've got the nice coins from those high-heeled shoes  And there he is  They've got that stripper sweat all over their feet  They're walking around on a floor that's probably been splooged on  Exactly  And there's this guy  And I guarantee you just turned on a guy out there 
[01:19:30]  By describing it  I guarantee you just turned someone on by describing it  Oh, that night in your room there  Were your feet wet?  Do you remember?  Uh-oh  I'm going to head to the bomb shelter right now  I'm going to head to the shelter  Feet wet?  All right, you're going to run with this one?  Huh  Feet wet  Oh, I get it  He's playing it off like he has no idea  I was always wondering why Rick didn't have his own radio show

[01:26:30]  Is our phone number  A couple more calls  On toe sucking  And then we'll move on  Stephanie, what's going on?  Hi  Hey  Hi, I'm a Rutgers student  And I'm on my way home  From school  With my friends  And I'm listening to the radio  And I was just wondering  What kind of girls  Attend Rutgers?  You're on the way home  Wait, wait  You're on the way home  From school with what?  Yeah, from school  Listening to your show  Oh, I thought you said  With my son  No, with my friends 
[01:27:00]  Oh, Jesus  You're a Rutgers student, right?  Yes  Okay  And I always thought  That to attend Rutgers  You need to have  Some sort of intelligence  But I guess not  I don't know  What kind of ground  To fall for  You know  You wouldn't fall for that?  No  Someone said  Do you have a spider  On your leg?  You'd look, right?  I would both  But if he doesn't  Take the shoe off  And get it off to me  I think it went  What if he said  I think it went  Into your sock  And then you try that?  No, I think  It was a fearless spider 
[01:27:30]  Going into your sock  I could see how  You could do it  You girls  You'd fall for it  What would it?  Oh, it went down  Your sock  You better take your sock  I heard these things  The spider bites  And they swell up  You better take that sock off  You better suck my C  Because it's an anti-venom  Just in case the spider bit you  Yeah, I don't know  I don't know  Maybe there are girls like that  I don't know  All right, Stephanie  Thank you  All right, thanks  Plenty of them  Jim has more on this  Jim, you're next on NAW  Hey, guys  Hey, Jim  I had read this a while ago 
[01:28:00]  I'd love to have a doctor  Follow me up  And see if it's actually true  But when they were  Mapping out the brain  They realized that  The region of the brain  That controls your feet  Is right next to the region  That controls your sexual desire  And therefore they suspect  That some people are actually  You know, have a  Because they're so close together  That they're kind of  Overlapping a little bit  Which causes some people  To go a little haywire  Really?  Which, you know,  A little scary  I mean, it explains it  Because, you know  I mean, I find feet attractive  But I don't want to suck on toes  And stuff like that  But, you know, it just makes sense  That, you know, there are varying levels of desire 
[01:28:30]  I've never seen an attractive foot  I mean, you could dress up some of them  With some nice shoes  But some of them look really good  And especially on the, you know, the whole picture of the girl  Yeah, with the ankle and everything  Right, but here it is  I think it's very simple  If a girl walked around with gloves on all the time  If women wore gloves all the time  When she took those gloves off  You'd get wood immediately  And want to suck on her hands  Yeah  Feet on girl  That's the perversion side 
[01:29:00]  Aside from the toe-less shoes or whatnot  The majority of the women  Especially in New York City  Walking through the streets  Wear shoes  And a lot of women wear just shoes  That cover up their feet most of the time  So when they're uncovered  It's just another part of the female body  That's uncovered  That's usually covered  You know?  Makes sense to me  Yeah  All right, Jim  It's a fairy  Well, thank you for that  Later, guys  We've got a foot fetish guy on the phone here  Dave, what's up?  Steve  Steve, you're into the foot fetish thing? 
[01:29:30]  No, I'm not into the foot fetish thing itself  I like the stocking feet  Okay  You know?  But it's not necessarily just the foot itself  I like legs  I think legs are very attractive  Compared to some people who might go for breasts  Uh-huh  And I don't think it's that outlandish  Considering some of the other stuff  That you've had on the show  No, I  I mean, I'm not going to break into somebody's house  And it looks like a pillow or anything like that  But I mean  You know, to each his own  I agree with you that  You know, having a foot fetish is pretty tame  But I just don't understand it  I don't understand, you know, where it starts 
[01:30:00]  Well, the thing is  You know, you don't understand somebody else's fetish over a breast  I mean, some guys go absolutely gaga over a breast  I mean, it's mostly why you have topless bras, right?  You don't have shoeless bars around  Wait, wait, wait  I've got to slow you down  I mean, I was working with you there and stuff  But I could understand a guy being into boobs  Before I could understand a guy being into feet  Yeah, but it's relative  You know, what turns you on doesn't turn me on  Whatever, you know  I accept that  I mean, you're into seeing feet before you see boobs 
[01:30:30]  Well, to be honest with you  I'd notice legs more than I would a chest  Well, I'm a leg man  Well, a leg man, that's cool  I mean, you know, a nice set of legs  Sure, we're talking just flat out feet  Yeah  Well, I'm just saying  I agree with you guys  It's outlandish to go break into somebody's house and suck a toe  But I don't think a foot fetish is disgusting  You know, I'm not saying worship the feet  And, you know, get jerked off by a feet or whatever  But  No, we didn't say it was disgusting  I'm saying I just never really got the foot fetish thing 
[01:31:00]  That's all I'm trying to say  I hear you  All right  You guys do a great job  Love the show  Thanks  I understand, you know, there's a lot of guys into it  I don't like the stocking thing either  Like, it looks cool when they're walking around  But some guys enjoy, like, the stockings on the feet and stuff  And, you know, just get the frig naked  Just take everything off  I want to deal with the stockings  Stockings always remind me of, like, old ladies  With the stockings  Rocky  Hey, guys, what's up, man? 
[01:31:30]  Hey  Yo, dude  I got to tell you one story, man  About one of my past girlfriends  Okay  And it dealt with her feet  I remember one time  I was all  We were all over a friend's house  And she's like  Rocky, Rocky  Can you give me a foot massage, honey?  And I'm like  All right, all right  So I break out  Like the Avion skin cream  I start waxing her feet down  Guys  When I got three seconds into it  She was, like, having an orgasm  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  I mean, she was, like  You know, she was basically just about convulsing 
[01:32:00]  All right  I got to say  Now, that sounds hot  That's pretty good  That's pretty cool  And actually, I'll tell you right now  I'm pretty good  I'm a pretty good guy with the hands  You know, I give good massages and everything  Because I've given to  I've given a few to a lot of women  But this is, like, one of the first times  I ever gave a foot massage  And, jeez, man  Forget about it  She was in ecstasy  Yeah  Yeah  All right  So I would say, hey, man  Now I'm understanding the foot thing a little better  When you're rubbing a girl's foot 
[01:32:30]  And she's having the big O  Okay  Something like that  Sounds kind of hot  Yeah  But, I mean, for these guys who are going in  And sucking on girls' feet  When out there  No one, you know  I wouldn't be too surprised  If they ended up becoming rapists or something  Yeah  Somebody who doesn't want to go the distance  All right, Rocky  Thank you  Okay, guys  Keep on rocking  Cool  Let's go to Andy  Andy, what's up?  Andy  Hey  How's it going?  All right  Hey, listen  Two possible explanations for this  Either the guys have a suppressed homosexual tendencies 
[01:33:00]  Or, number two  They have, you know  They just have a real low view of themselves  They have an inferiority complex  And they feel the need to, you know  Degrade themselves this way  Ah, there you go  Are you like Einstein or something?  One of these  Dr. Freud  I mean, Freud, yeah  I mean, you know  Think about it  These guys have to go to a bar  To pay to be with these women  They just feel like  Listen, I can't have these women on my own  All right 
[01:33:30]  Thank you  Exactly my point  The point I'm trying to make  Obviously  It's schizophrenia  John  Yo, Dave  What's up?  I'll tell you what  Unless you had it done  You don't know what you're missing  It's awesome  All right  So you have a girl that sucks on your toes  I used to, yeah  And it was a big turn on  Oh, yeah  At first I thought it was a little weird  But then, you know  It happened  It was great  Why was it great? 
[01:34:00]  I don't know  I started sporting wood  So what do you know?  But why?  I've got to be careful here  Because of the actual feeling  Or what?  Yeah  Yeah, that's pretty much it  All right  It's got to be a sexual thing  Right?  Yeah, I'm going to go listen to myself  Be called  Marsalis Wallace  Threw a guy out a window  Right?  For massaging his wife's feet  Huh?  From Pulp Fiction  Oh  That whole argument that they had 
[01:34:30]  About the foot massage  Bebe  Hey  Hey, what's up Bebe?  How you doing?  I am Bebe  I remember that guy  I'll tell you where the  Perversion comes from  Okay  Many sexual perversions  Come from when you're a child  Yeah  And it's  I had to do a report  On fetishes  For a sexuality class  And it  What every book said  Was it had to do  With little boys 
[01:35:00]  Who were raised  By their moms  And just crawling on the floor  Hanging out by their feet  And there was something  That happened  In their brain  That just snapped  And they grew up  With a perversion  Same things  With the stockings  And all that  Had to do with like  Little boys  Going underneath the table  And looking up  Their mom's skirt  And probably  Because they were  Rubbing one out  On their aunt's foot  Or something  Oh  Pumping it like a chihuahua  Yeah  All right baby  Thanks  All right  We're going to have to move on 
[01:35:30]  This is going nowhere  One more call  Greg what's up  Hey how's it going  Hey  Dude that guy was very right  And you're not far off yourself  This is  It's the kind of thing  That happens when you're a kid  And you know  It's like you said  As a kid  A kid can get excited  And stuff  And it just so happens  That if you're taking  A real good look at something  Or something happens to you  And you're rubbing yourself  Or whatever  It can trigger something  That could last your whole lifetime  You wouldn't even know about it  Well  All right 
[01:36:00]  I don't know  I don't get it  Dude I went to a therapist  About it  It's true  Why what did you have  A foot fat  I got something  I don't want to say what it is  But I have a fetish  And I went to talk to somebody  About it  Because it gets to dominate  Your life after a while  No one knows who you are  What was your fetish  I don't want to say  Give us a hit  Come on  No one knows you  Can we play  I really don't want to get into it  But I'll tell you  That was her explanation  She had to take me  All the way back  To my childhood  And try and figure it out  And it has to do with  When you're at a real 
[01:36:30]  Impressionable age  And something happens  Like that  What did you see then  Let's ask you  What happened to you  At a young age  That gave you  This unknown fetish  Just something  That  You know  I saw something  Happening with  My mother  And other women  Really  Like what  You saw them  Go to the bathroom  No  On the shower  Hey can we play  Guess Greg's fetish  Yeah  I got it  I'm all curious now  No you'll never get it  Did you see  Your mother  And other women 
[01:37:00]  In a nude situation  No it's nothing sexual  It doesn't have to be  A sexual thing  There's nothing really  Sexual about  But now this thing  Turned out to be  A turn on for you  For many years  Yes  Oh my god  Now you got  My curiosity  Did it involve cooking  No  Did it involve  Cleaning the house  It wasn't a sexual thing  That these two ladies  Were doing  That's right  Smoking cigars  No  No  Oh that's a good one  Great come on  Can we play  Guess your fetish 
[01:37:30]  No I'm not  I'm not going to tell you  Something drinking  Or eating  No  No  I'm not going to tell you  But it is  It's an act  Go ahead  How about you  Leave us with a hint  And then you know  And then we'll  We'll try to figure it out  And you can hang up  No that's okay  But I'm telling you  You're all on track  Here with this stuff  I don't have the  Foot fetish thing  But it's very similar  Greg yeah  We really hate you  Come on you can't do this  You can't do this  We hate when people  Tease us on this show  I know  Now you got  You have so many people  In their cars going  Trying to guess right now 
[01:38:00]  And no one knows you  So just give us  A clue  I'll tell you this though  If you're on the internet  Hold on hold on  There's thousands  And thousands of people  Who have what I have  And you just have  No clue about it  Until you realize it  They were just  I thought I was  All along the whole time  Are you  I just found there are  Thousands of people  Who have this  And are into this  There's a lot of stuff  On the internet about it  Are you a plushie lover  No  Alright  Is it something to do  With the human waste  No  Okay well no  You're not giving us anything  So we got to run through  All kinds of things 
[01:38:30]  You just said there's  Thousands and thousands  Of people like you  There are  You went to a therapist  So if we can guess this  You know there'll be  A bunch of people  That could relate to it  Yeah  Yeah that's great  You'd be helping  It's too  It was something  When you were really young  You saw two ladies doing  Yeah I guess you could say that  I guess you could say it that way  Anymore  I don't  I really don't want to  Give it away  The longer I stay on  The more I'm going to be dead  Is it a rubber fetish  No  Is it an enema fetish  No  I'm just looking at you know 
[01:39:00]  Because these are all these  Perversions that are on the internet  I think it's something  Very very tame  Is it tame  Or is it outrageous  I would say it's on the tamer side  Nothing really disgusting about it  It's something that really  You were just surprised  That something like this  Is a turn on to you  And you had to go to a therapist  To find out right  It's nothing you would give it  A second thought about  Spanking  Spanking  No  I'm going to let you guys go  I love you  Are you a chubby chaser  No

[01:40:30]  Four to eight weeks  Something everyone has to do  Men and women  Right  And this is because  You saw your mother  And another woman  Doing this  Well yeah  More or less  In my house  When I was really young  And it must have been  At the right time of the day  Or something for me  So  Maybe you'll figure it out  Maybe you won't  Time of the month stuff  No  God  Because it's men and women  Oh men and women  All right  Do we have to do this  Every few weeks

XFL game day blooper reel.  Yeah, it's hilarious.  Hilarious.  I had a tear in my eye there.  With the, uh, music playing in the background.  It kind of brought back to memory.  There's a clip of, uh, Vince McMahon denying that he knew anything about, uh, XFL game day.  And then, and then the next clip shows us interviewing Vince McMahon on XFL game day.

No, three minutes long, Anthony.  Quick, but really, really good.  Very poignant.  One of the many things that will be happening at the road show tonight when we get our asses 
[01:58:30]  down there.  Doors are gonna open at, uh, six o'clock, Ant.  Yeah.  For the main room.  I guess they've opened doors for like a small area that has a bar because people have been waiting  in the rain.  Yeah.  Um, ten minutes, the club will start filling up.  Seven o'clock, the festivities begin.  And we should be there by eight at the latest.  At the latest.  At the latest.  Lots of, lots of things to do tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Can't wait to get there, actually.  My ass is dragging here today. 
[01:59:00]  We get so pumped up to do these things, you know.  Just want to get out and get it rolling.  Yeah, we've had a pretty good show.  Just want to get there.  Good show.  Show continues tonight for many, many hours.  I know.  That's just it.  And I was like, okay.  Radio show.  Well, can we go now?  I'm going to get on stage and start drinking some beer.  Oh, by the way, yeah.  We have a contestant for the best ass contest.  What's her name?  She's going to be a finalist because I walked out to go check out the video. 
[01:59:30]  And she's bent over the couch looking really hot.  And all of a sudden she goes, Rick, Rick, am I done?  And Rick goes, oh, no, no, you're not done yet.  So I turned to her and I go, that's a good sign.  That means you have a very nice boutique.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If it was anyone else and Rick wasn't digging it, he would have said, oh, yeah, you're done.  You see one flash from behind you and then, okay, we're done.  You go, what?  What?  Sometimes Rick actually just flashes a flashlight and says, okay, thank you. 
[02:00:00]  Really quick.  Thanks for coming.  What's your name?  Myra.  Hi, Myra.  Where are you from?  New York.  New York?  Yeah.  She doesn't want to give out too much info?  No.  Oh, no.  And she has a very nice back end there, Anthony.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes, which you can see on the website.  And then we'll pick our finalists and you people get to vote.  You're the only contestant today.  Yeah, I noticed.  What's going on with that?  That's okay.  We're 30 girls already and tomorrow's the last day for the ladies to come on down to  try to win that trip to Las Vegas from Gear Magazine. 
[02:00:30]  I think we'll have a good turnout tomorrow.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's Friday, you know?  Friday.  First of all, the weather sucks.  It's Thursday.  It's all right.  We have enough if it ends today.  If no more ladies come down.  But ladies, yeah, tomorrow's your last day.  Brian Regan will be here.  He loves looking at the butts.  Ah, yes.  And we want to thank Pitical Horny Goatweed for sponsoring the Best Ass contest.  Can we take a look?  Right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Why not?  And the pants are coming down.  It's a spider. 
[02:01:00]  Go down your pants.  Maybe you have to.  Oh, it's my tattoo.  Wait a minute.  No.  No.  Wow, look at that.  Maybe girls would fall for that.  That's an asshole, right?  She did fall for that ass.  That's nice.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Nice presentation, right?

Good luck.  Good luck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Bravo.  All right.  Ladies, tomorrow is your last day.  Are we ready for the Olsen Twins song of the day?  How we ever got to this point in our radio careers.  Olsen Twins song of the day. 
[02:02:00]  We've noticed that all the little Olsen Twins songs are very sexually oriented.  A lot of sexual innuendo in them.  I think it's done on purpose.  They're starting to get up there in their age.  Sure, they're still, but children.  But you can see the potential budding in the little flowers that are the Olsen Twins.  Well, we're deeply disturbed because we've been listening to the Olsen Twins and their  music.  Yeah.  And they're addicted to sex.  Every song is about sex with these little girls. 
[02:02:30]  Gimme, gimme, gonna, gonna, gonna pull an all-nighter with yesterday's song.  Oh, my God.  What is that saying?  And what about the song about stuff in crack?  Critters on their crack.  Bugs on their baloney.  Ants in their pants.  And I swear it was this big.  I believe they're not getting the right guidance.  Yeah.  Well, I think this is done on purpose by their management or whatever it takes to, like,  get this underlying sexual thing in there.  And that's what's selling these two.  Come on.  You give me another reason why these two are so huge. 
[02:03:00]  Sex, Opie.  Every song is about sex.  Yeah.  Today's Olsen Twins song of the day is Come As You Are by the Olsen Twins.  Yes.  Listen for yourself.  Come As You Are by the Olsen Twins.  Come As You Are by the Olsen Twins.  Come As You Are by the Olsen Twins.  Come As You Are by the Olsen Twins.  Come As You Are by the Olsen Twins.  You are, and there's no way that you can do. 
[02:03:30]  Now it occurred to me, not too long ago, that the styles we wear, well they come and go.  But each and every time, they never fall away, express in many styles what we feel to say.  You're a fucking whore!  50s puppies never really went away, 50s, 50s, well, they are filthy today, the 70s, they're dancing to us. 
[02:04:00]  Loser, those losers.  Baby smiles were crazy, and big hands were...  Don't drink them a rat.  It's in the hole!  Hey, they're rapping.  ...for a great...  ...for cancer... 
[02:04:30]  ...for cancer...  ...for cancer...  ...for cancer...  ...for cancer...  ...as you are...  ...experts and stuff...  ...the way you...  ...to...  ...as you are...  ...and there's no way that you can do...  ...and we are...  ...and we are...  ...Now the 90s are upon us...  ...with the styles of their own...  ...we are so fun the older time...  ...the hip hop...  ...and the...  ...the...  ...the things that I agree in...  ...two...  ...two... 
[02:05:00]  ... two...  ...two...  ...two...  ...  Oh, it just ends.  Butt sex.  That's all we get of that one? 
[02:05:30]  Thank God.  I was starting to...  Snaps the scudo.  Vomit.  There you have it.  That one, not quite as sexually explicit, but twice as annoying as any of the previous ones.  I heard a lot of sexual innuendo in there, Anthony.  Did you?  Vaginas.  See, now you're just playing clips.  Was that in the song, all those clips?  Yes, they were.  You're heinous, eh.  All right.  I think we're getting into a weird area here. 
[02:06:00]  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Ouch.  I thought it was a cover of the Nirvana song, to tell you the truth.  Well, that's what we thought, too.  That would have been much better.  Maybe it would have been smart to listen to the song before you went on the radio.  We have a road show to do.  How could we possibly...  Maybe we should have went with, give me pizza today.  That would have made a little more sense than that.  Okay.

[02:13:00]  This is the first road show where we're bringing video.  Yeah, we're multimedia.  Kind of.  Yeah.  I guess they're going to start running video of an old road show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the one we did in Island Park.  As people filter into the venue and, you know, get their beers and stuff.  Was that the stuff Steve put together?  No.  Oh.  No.  Wow, where did this come from?  I don't know.  Somebody was filming our last road show.  Nice.  And then, yeah, Steve from PhantomTreeMusic.com put together a little highlight reel of some 
[02:13:30]  of the stuff that we've done recently.  And I hear the Limo Anthony getting darts thrown at his back.  Yeah.  As a part of that highlight reel.  I hear that's really, really funny.  Stink, did you see that earlier?  Which one?  Steve's video?  Not at all.  I hear that's really good.  It's the virtual road show.  Before the road show.  And then...  Experience it in video form.  Yeah, he also has the guys puking up that milk from two, three days ago.  That'll make you puke on video. 
[02:14:00]  It's really funny, though.  Has QFARP's Pete been contacted?  Yeah, his secretary filled him in, and he's coming.  Him and his friend.  He did secretary.  We all want to know if he's bringing the brownies.  I think he is.  Ah!  The tasty brownies.  God.  That's going to be the showstopper.  No, that...  I can't watch that.  You will hear and see, if you go to the road show,  grown men screaming like little girls when he pulls out the brownies. 
[02:14:30]  It's bad enough that people drink in the milk and puking up white milk and...  Man, it's just brownies.  Nuh-uh.  Whatever you want to call them.  I call it crap.  You're insulting Pete's cooking.  He pulls that out of his pocket, like he did here in the studio.  The reaction.  And he starts digging into that bag.  The reaction will be felt all the way to Montauk.  You'll hear it. 
[02:15:00]  Look at that reference.  Hey, Long Island reference.  That's right.  What else is going on tonight?  We've got Jim Florentine doing some comedy.  Stephen Lynch will be performing some songs.  Hopefully, the brand new second verse to Special Olympics.  Oh, I'm sure.  That he debuted yesterday.  We've got Fuel with his six songs.  Mm-hmm.  The whole gang from Q Farts, including Pete and his brownie bag.  Pete, definitely the star.  Yeah, Mistress Rhiannon will be on hand with her...  Jack-o-lantern boobs.  Yeah, boob-o-lanterns.  Yeah, boob-o-lanterns.  You put flashlights under them and they glow like jack-o-lanterns. 
[02:15:30]  Very, very funny.  We've got the gang from IBetYouWill.com on hand.  And have people come up and do some stuff.  The lovely and talented Melissa, who's in the studio right now.  Hey.  Who used to intro us at the WWF restaurant for XFL game day.  It's good to see you guys again.  Hey, yeah.  After we were all let go.  I know.  The big firing.  But how can we be fired from a show that never existed?  Exactly.  As far as Vince McMahon's concerned.  Vince says it didn't exist. 
[02:16:00]  And hey, I'm taking that one off my resume.  Never happened.  It happened.  So it's going to be good to have you back there introducing us, I guess.  Well, it's my pleasure.  Yeah, and then you could help out.  You know, you could be like the girl that helps out in any of the dopey contests we do up on stage.  And I think the listeners will be nothing but gentlemen.  I'm sure they will.  Please be kind to me, everyone.  Oh, you thought the XFL game day crowd was bad?  That was after we beat them into submission.  I know.  Telling them to be cool, be cool, be cool. 
[02:16:30]  And then they were the way they were, which was animals.  Oh, my God.  I welcome the challenge.  Well, obviously.  Look what you're wearing.  You're insane.  Yeah, this is just going to be like just the raunchiest.  You're starting to look like an injured gazelle.  Yeah.  Getting ready to go into the limping fawn.  It's going to be me, and I hope they treat me kindly.  We'll just call you chum.  You're a chum.  I'll just hide behind you guys.  You are.  They don't care about us.  Believe me.  Don't go through us to take a look at you. 
[02:17:00]  They can care less about us.  Yeah.  Also, Cat, the boob champ will be there, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Speaking of XFL game day, our friends at NBC put together a fine blooper reel.  Yeah.  It was, I mean, we watched it about 20 minutes ago.  We were laughing really, really hard.  It's got our curses in it.  Yeah.  When we would screw up.  But the best is Vince McMahon denying there ever was a show, and then the next shot is  us interviewing Vince on the show that he denied never happened.  He denied.  You know, if you're going to deny a show existed, you shouldn't have appeared on it. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  It's very important that we get everyone to be quiet for this tape, because the audio is  hilarious.  Let me hear Vince.  I think we have the dunk tank, the wet t-shirt dunk tank, hopefully.  Mm-hmm.  The lesbian couch, and...  Oh, God knows what happens on that thing.  Uh, Mr. Potato Head is warming up the crowd as we speak, most likely.  Yes.  Yes.  And it's, uh, getting together with his old band, Rock Gut, to do a couple tunes.  One last gig, man!  Including...  We're getting the old band back together, man! 
[02:18:00]  Including...  Naked Cowboy.  Right.  I, I, I just don't see it happening.  Oh, yeah.  You, you wait.  You either do it the right way, or just don't do it.  I, I will respect you if you decide not to do it, because you're not, because you don't  want to go on stage like you used to do for this song.  It's a part of the show.  Got to do it.  So the only thing, three, you'll be wearing three things.  A big, goofy, Imus cowboy hat.  Imus, uh, cowboy hat.  Right.  Yes.  Uh, underpants.  Right. 
[02:18:30]  So there's nothing sexual about it, so I'm saying underpants.  Right.  To make it perfectly clear.  And, uh, cowboy boots.  And cowboy boots.  And you swear, that's all you'll be wearing.  And a bandana.  Bandana.  Uh, you gotta wear a band, a cowboy bandana around your neck.  There's no way.  And I, I know you.  I got my chew in the backy.  And six years ago, yeah, you do it.  I don't think you're doing it.  Why?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  Could be the highlight of the show.  Might be.  I'm thinking.  That could be it right there. 
[02:19:00]  Uh, when we, when we take all the calls tomorrow, that could be the one that everyone, uh, points  to.  Could be.  We'll have to see.  Are you guys gonna be hanging from nooses tonight?  Nah, I would've liked to have done that, but that's a little, a little much.  That's too cool.  Takes a little too much set-up time.  Yeah.  But we do have the, uh, unbelievably thrilling disco opener.  The Tony Manero Saturday Night Fever Disco Inferno opener, which is just a showstopper.  Yeah.  I gotta tell you right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I recreate exactly all of the best dance moves that Tony Manero did when, uh, he went 
[02:19:30]  out on the dance floor.  Yeah.  He wouldn't even be able to tell, uh, tell it apart.  The moves.  So exact.  He did a little Russian dance thing that he did and the hand, the wave hand thing.  Oh, sure.  And you guys will also be performing, uh, Marsha Brady?  Ah, yes.  The Marsha Brady song.  The ode to the, uh, well, the cutest Brady.  All right.  Ben is at the Vanderbilt.  Let's get an update. 
[02:20:00]  Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  What's happening?  Oh, he's been drinking.  No, I haven't been at all.  I gotta be honest with you.  Not at all.  Getting things going here.  They just opened the doors to the main floor.  Okay.  We opened a bar downstairs because it's raining out.  It's filling in.  Anthony's brother and the band just, uh, finished soundcheck.  They ripped through soundcheck.  And people are filing in and we'll be starting all of the festivities at, uh, seven.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a lot of stuff.  This is good.  We got a lot of stuff packed in.  Cool.  Yeah.  You guys aren't waiting for us to show up. 
[02:20:30]  You're starting it at seven.  Yeah.  We're in a roll.  So, a lot of people filed in.  We just opened the main floor and it already filled up.  So, we're in good shape.  We're in good shape.  Yeah.  So, let's rock.  So, let's get you guys out there and let's get going.  We're leaving in 10 minutes, Ben.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, bro.  I'll talk to you.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Bobby.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey.  This guy's going to be on Long Island tonight.  What about Timmy?  Uh, there, uh, maybe.  You have to get her going down there, man.  We, we invited Timmy from Survivor to show up. 
[02:21:00]  We'll see what happens.  I think she'll show up.  She's just going to surprise you guys.  Unless you guys got something up your sleeve and you're not telling us.  Nah.  No, that's not one of our surprises.  Nah.  If she shows, though, it would be great and we'll get her on stage to say hey to everybody.  All right?  All right.  See you guys later.  You're a redneck.  Uh, okay.  All right.  Lou, what's up?  What's happening, fellas?  Hey.  Uh, is Nicky showing up to do keggers or what?  I don't think so.  We deliver keggers.  Remember that one?  That was great at one of the last, uh, rednecks.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Someone is complaining about the Ask Contest.  One of the contestants.  Jessica.  Yes.  Hi.  I'm Jessica.  I was there that day.  With Melody, contestant number two, the girl with the red hair.  Oh, my God.  Do you remember me?  Oh, man.  Wow.  Yeah?  I don't remember you being this annoying.  Oh.  Okay.  Well, I was just calling because there's some really great contestants in the contest.  Yeah.  I don't like the fact that her picture looks all abstract and scary.  And everybody else has these cute pictures.  And they're getting spanked and on a couch.  And that doesn't seem very fair.  Why?  Why?  Oh, so your friend, Melody, got her pictures taken. 
[02:22:00]  And you're not happy with the pictures that were taken.  Right?  Yeah.  You kind of got a valid point.  You know what?  I'm looking at the pictures that have been taken recently.  If you look at contestants 16, 17, 14, you know, in that whole area, there's some pretty provocative poses.  Then you go to contestant one, two, not even three.  That's Patty.  And they're very clinical. 
[02:22:30]  You know?  Yeah.  I kind of agree.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  I know, but I'm getting scared here.  You know, it makes me sad to see all these cute pictures.  And my friend looks like scary, you know?  Jessica, tell you what we'll do.  Okay.  Tomorrow is the last day to qualify for the contest.  Uh-huh.  So why don't you guys come down for a little reshoot?  Would you let us?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, tomorrow the ladies can still come down to qualify.  Oh, okay.  That would be fun.  Oh, and one other thing.  That guy who had that weird fetish.  Yeah?  Did we ever figure out what it was? 
[02:23:00]  We're thinking haircuts.  I used to be a hairdresser, and I don't think it's haircuts.  But I was thinking maybe it's like something normal, like maybe like watering your plants or like cleaning your toilet.  Do you think of something like that?  Because it's making me crazy.  I want to know what it is.  Hey, Jessica.  Yeah?  You know what?  I can't beat that line, unfortunately.  And I had to go on.  Hey, Jessica, we'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.  Bye, guys.  Leave the voice home, though, okay? 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Should have hung up right after that gunshot.  Too good.  All right.  All right.  We can play a quick round of what did we learn on the O&A show, because we do have to get out of here in like eight minutes.  Oh, who's our name?  Myra?  Amira?  That was just Melody.  Melody.  Right?  Who was contestant?  Oh, I thought this was new pictures that were up.  Oh, from earlier, yeah.  What's her name?  Myra.  Myra.  Myra's pictures are up from today.  Yeah, her pictures are up.  That's a very nice book.  Those look very nice. 
[02:24:00]  That's a contender right there.  She's got the right thong for the job.  Nice poses.  There you go.  She may have won the trip to Vegas.  Ladies, last chance to get in on the contest tomorrow.  I don't want to keep saying it, but there's some confusion.  You can still come down tomorrow and get your pictures taken, okay?  Yes.  And then the voting will start next week, and we'll give away that trip to Vegas.  We'll be ground zero on that show.  I want to thank Pinnacle Hornet Goat Week for sponsoring the best-ass contest.  I haven't seen some of these until right now. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my goodness.  What happened there?  This chick took her undies off?  Oh, okay.  Let me see.  Turn around.  Turn around to her.  Oh, look at that.  Looky, looky, dad.  Put some great pictures up.  They're all on www.com.  Plenty of contestants.  All right, let's go to the phones.  Kevin, what's going on?  What's happening, R&A?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that lips are also called soup coolers today. 
[02:25:00]  Big soup coolers.  Very good.  Thank you.  Have a good one, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, man.  Let's go to Adam.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Today, I learned that Opie used to live in a crack house.  Well, yeah.  Now, I'm going to call myself a tool.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a nice day.  Bye.  And he just did.  And you'll get to hear it, too.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I learned that guy was one sickass.  Greg, with that weird fetish?  Yeah, because you run a search through the Internet, and you type in haircut fetish. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Apparently, a lot of guys like J. Owen while they're getting their haircuts.  Oh, yeah?  I see.  I never heard of that one.  So, think about it.  Next time, you've got to go in for a trim.  Yeah, great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Steven.  Steven, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that there's a connection between my feet and my yam bag.  Yeah, that guy was trying to convince me of that.  And I also learned that a black girl tried to rape Opie when he worked up in Buffalo.  Have a good time tonight, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Bye. 
[02:26:00]  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, what's up?  Guys.  Hey.  Just like leftovers, I learned that sound effects of Psycho Monk, Limo Anthony, and Payne are  just as funny the second day than they are on the first day.  That was a lot of fun.  The video of that will be shown at the road show tonight.  Guys, have a safe trip.  Thank you.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Later.  Troy from Jersey.  What did I learn?  I learned Splooge is a great anti-venom for spider bites.  Yeah.  Also tomorrow, Brian Regan coming in.  Finally.  He was supposed to be here today.  Well, the Northeast has screwed that up today. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  God, I can't wait to get down there.  We could leave now.  It's action happening and we're not there.  We could leave.  Any minute now.  Let's see.  Anthony is the racist.  Matt learned that today.  Opie is the psychopath.  Dino from Jersey.  I learned today that Opie doesn't have the right parts.  That's good.  I learned $1 million tax-free.  That's $2 million. 
[02:27:00]  Troy from Jersey.  I learned I should have brought a fake ID into the studio with me today.  Ouch.  Sorry, Troy.  I also learned that Big Cab also goes by the name of Sean Eckert.  That's too good.  I'm sorry.  Sorry you have to deal with that.  That's a good one, though, man.  Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was going to say the Sean Eckert thing, but a few days ago I learned that if you drink  part of a gallon of milk at 4.30, don't take the 6 o'clock train home from the city. 
[02:27:30]  No, that's not a good idea.  No, it's definitely not.  All right.  I'll see you later, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Yeah, nothing's going on here.  We've got to get out of here.  Yeah.  We've got a road show to do in Plainview, the Vanderbilt, right off the LIE.  It's not too late if you can get on the Internet and get your directions and head down there,  okay?  Yes.  All right.  Well, let's leave with some Brian Regan.  All right.  We have a great little bit for the people that aren't going on the road show that are still 
[02:28:00]  listening to the radio show.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty getting felt up is minutes away, okay?  Nice.  Here, pick one from Brian Regan.  Oh, no.  I've got to pick one.  How about, uh, I'm going to do a little league?  No, we've done that one a lot.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, how about, uh, stupid in school?  No, we've done that one a lot.  Oh, okay. 
[02:28:30]  Okay.  How about the gym?  I've done that one a lot.  Oh.  Here, give it to me.  Okay.  You're killing me.  I was picking the ones.  I know.  I didn't mean, like, donut lady, or how about peanut butter and jelly?  You just did donut lady.  How about peanut butter and jelly?  All right.  Okay.  Brian Regan coming in tomorrow.  We'll see you guys at, uh, the road show in about an hour, hopefully.  Yeah.  It's another Opie and Anthony road show tonight at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, Long Island. 
[02:29:00]  Stores open at 6.  O&A will be there after the show.  21 and older only.  Get directions and other info on WNEW.com.  1027.  WNEW.  WNEW. </pre>
