<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This "After O&A Live" episode, hosted by Sam Roberts in the absence of Opie and Anthony, primarily focused on revisiting several significant moments in the show's history.  The broadcast opened with a discussion of Larry King's surprising in-studio appearance.  Roberts recounted the irony, given the show's history of mocking King, particularly a clip showcasing King's hilariously awkward interview with a skateboarder where he asked, "How important is the board?"  The clip was played, followed by a snippet of King's post-interview defense of his question.

The four-year anniversary of the show's 30-day suspension stemming from the "Homeless Charlie" interview was also heavily discussed. A clip of their subsequent, seemingly insincere apology, embellished with the phrase "big time," was aired.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to playing a lengthy clip of a past, heated in-studio confrontation with Whoopi Goldberg, who was well aware of the show's relentless mockery of her radio work. The clip showcased angry exchanges, apologies, and an eventual, somewhat uneasy resolution.  The contrast between Goldberg's unexpected, confrontational visit and King's planned appearance was highlighted.

Finally, the return of Ron Bennington (from Ron and Fez) after a period of unexplained absence was discussed, with much humorous speculation regarding the reasons for his hiatus. The show concluded with standard promotional announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, you bet it is.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony are out of here. The rest of us are still here.  Keeping the channel live.  This place is buzzing about that Larry King interview.  Everybody gets very excited when a good interview happens here.  Especially with somebody on the level of Larry King, 
[00:00:30]  who is not only important in a general sense,  is a big pop culture figure,  but, I mean, to this show, there's probably no one bigger.  None of us thought that that interview was going to happen.  Nobody here thought that that guy was going to come in here  until literally today when he walked in.  I mean, apparently, he didn't realize  how much time we spent playing his more embarrassing moments on his show.  So, if he knew the extent to which those clips were played,  I don't know what would have happened. 
[00:01:00]  But, he didn't, and it ended up very well.  So, what can we complain about?  I talked about it at the end of the show.  I did ask Larry King about the skateboard.  Everybody was saying, you know,  that was probably the other great clip.  There was the groceries,  there was the skateboard.  We played the skateboard clip.  I asked him about it.  We'll play it in a little bit.  But, also, we didn't have a show on Friday.  But, apparently, nobody had told Bobo  as he thought it would be okay  to call me on my cell phone, 
[00:01:30]  which my lovely co-workers, I'm sure,  supplied him with the phone number  because I figured since it's Friday  and we don't have a show,  that would be a great time to somewhat sleep in,  not have to wake up early.  But, no, at 7.30, my phone was ringing.  Luckily, I had no qualms about looking at the phone,  seeing Bobo,  and putting the phone back down  and realizing that I'll wake up when I wake up  and have a lovely voicemail to go to,  which I'll share with all of you. 
[00:02:00]  I wish I'd never invited him on  after Opie and Anthony Live  because it's just,  it's been a disaster in my life ever since.  But, before all that, first of all,  I'm looking in the production booth.  Sex Bagel is not here.  Somebody much thinner.  Travis, Sex Bagel, where is he?  Sex Man's on vacation.  Sex Man decided to take a week for himself.  He's taking a week off.  Who needs this?  Well, do you think he's going to come back thinner?  Thinner?  Yeah.  No.  Oh.  Sex Man, Eric Nagel, is indeed on vacation. 
[00:02:30]  I can't believe that none of you  could figure that out listening to the show.  But, yeah, his presence was not on the air today.  Well, one of the first things I learned in radio school  is that nobody will notice when things are going great  because things are going great, you know?  I see.  It goes off without a hitch.  So, today, E-Rock not being here went off without a hitch?  Things went great.  Wow.  Why?  Is he taking the whole week off?  Whole week, maybe.  It's for himself.  Just for himself.  The rest of us, though?  Everyone, you're here.  Danny's here. 
[00:03:00]  Derek's here.  We'll all be working.  Yep.  E-Rock gets a nice week.  Where is he?  Oh, I don't know if we should say that.  Can we at least say, like, what part?  Like, we don't have to say the hotel.  Sure, yeah.  You can say Bahamas, right?  Yeah, you can say Bahamas.  Having a nice time in the Bahamas while the rest of us are slaving away.  Well, I hope he enjoys himself.  Today, though, is a major anniversary.  We celebrate a lot of anniversaries on this here show after Opie and Anthony live.  And it wasn't necessarily, well, the day itself was a day not unlike most. 
[00:03:30]  But the outcome of what was the anniversary of today was horrible.  Because today, it's four years, right?  Yeah, four years.  Four years ago today, we invited a man up to the studio and asked for his take on everything  that was going on in the world from, you know, day-to-day life to politics to everything  you can imagine.  Oh, there's Larry King.  No, he's not bringing him in here.  I wish he would.  Everything you could imagine. 
[00:04:00]  We brought a man up to the studio whose name was Homeless Charlie.  Homeless Charlie had a lot to say about a lot of things, and it ended up getting us suspended  from then XM, now Sirius XM, but then XM, satellite radio, for 30 days.  And, I mean, Travis, you're the only one who's here right now.  You remember that time.  None of us thought we were going back to work.  No, I was fairly certain we were fired.  Yeah, I mean, we were even wondering if CBS would keep us. 
[00:04:30]  It seemed like we were still going to have K-Rock shows.  But we were sure, even like at day 27, we were like, yeah, at the end of the 30 days,  there's no way.  Yeah, I don't think any of us believed it until it was like we were back in that studio.  Yeah, they're actually letting us back.  Like, we packed the studio.  We brought all our stuff home.  There was nothing there.  But there's a clip that hasn't been replayed in a long time, and a lot of people thought  it was not going to happen anytime soon. 
[00:05:00]  But here on After Opie and Anthony Live, we're here to provide a service, and we're doing  just that today.  Because for the first time in a very long time, to celebrate the four-year anniversary, ladies  and gentlemen, I present to you the homeless Charlie apology that they did the day after.  Here's the apology.  Oh, that's it?  Hey, we're here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's May 11, 2007.  We are live. 
[00:05:30]  I just want to say we're taking what happened on Wednesday very, very seriously.  Very, very seriously.  And we're listening to XM on this one, big time.  Yeah, we apologize to the public officials for comments that were made on the XM show  on May 9th.  And we do take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom that we  get here and regret any offense that this segment has caused. 
[00:06:00]  You've got to love when people throw casual words into an obviously corporate written statement  as if to say, yep, these are just our words.  And so, like, like, Opie adding in big time to the obviously lawyer written note as if  to say, yep, this is a legitimate apology.  Of course, they later came out on the air and announced for everybody that they didn't  mean a word of it.  You don't think it was written in the apology big time?  You don't think those words were in there?  Yeah, the lawyers put it in just so they could sound a little cool.  Just say big time after this. 
[00:06:30]  But yeah, obviously, that's all we'll cover on the homeless Charlie saga.  You all remember what happened.  I mean, I'm sure somewhere Brea Bart still has it up or something.  But today was a big day for the show, regardless of what happened four years ago, because Larry  King was in.  Larry King, a man that we've poked for.  By the way, I see Ron and Fez studio being set up.  We're back live today?  Are we psyched?  Thumbs up, baby.  It's going to be a big show.  Ron and Fez are back live today. 
[00:07:00]  I just hope I get to hear from my co-host at the bottom of the hour, as we say in radio,  at the bottom of the hour.  But today was a big day for Owen.  Larry King was in.  Somebody that we've made fun of for so long, in a loving way.  Larry, if you're listening, which you're probably not because you're in out queue right now.  In a loving way, we've made fun of you.  But that's not the first person that we've made fun of, for sure.  And it's not the first time we've been confronted in studio.  So, uh, Whoopi Goldberg, who you all know from, uh, what would, uh, Sister Act. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, Sister Act, that's the one.  But now on The View, uh, she had a morning radio show here in New York for a while.  And we, at the same time, had a morning radio show and decided to use our airwaves to make  fun of what she was doing, something not unlike we do to Scott and Todd or 30 different  radio shows throughout the month of October.  But yeah, we did that to Whoopi Goldberg.  But we did it, uh, relentlessly.  We hammered her every single day for, like, two weeks about, uh, bits she was doing. 
[00:08:00]  I remember one was about suntan lotion.  I don't remember what the punchline was, but I remember her doing a lot of suntan lotion  bits.  Well, on one, uh, momentous day in the XM studios, our old boss, Eric Logan, decided to surprise  us all and bring Whoopi Goldberg herself to confront Opie and Anthony.  Uh, she, however, unlike Larry King, was aware of what Opie and Anthony had been saying about 
[00:08:30]  her, making it a very interesting day for all of us indeed.  Here it is.  Whoopi Goldberg surprising Opie and Anthony on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hold on, hold on.  Who's this?  Elo.  What's up, dude?  Is that Elo?  That's Elo.  That's Eric Logan.  You don't return my calls.  Shut the fuck out of here.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jimmy, turn around.  Oh, wow.  All right.  All right.  Holy shit.  All right.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:09:00]  Mother of God.  We're in trouble.  You know something?  You got bravo.  You got balls.  Bravo, Whoopi.  Whoopi Goldberg in studio.  Wow.  Good morning.  Good to see y'all.  I understand you've been sending messages for me to come in.  So I decided I'd come up and see y'all because I know you were concerned about a couple of  things and I really wanted to clear it up, you know, because especially the whole thing  about the, you know, the, uh, what do you call it? 
[00:09:30]  The, the what?  The stuff that you put on your...  The sunscreen.  Yeah, the sunscreen.  The sunscreen, because I know you were concerned that black people didn't know anything about  sunscreen, so I thought I'd come up and tell you your mamas were wrong and they put the  wrong shit on you.  You know what?  Okay.  So let me just run through all of it.  All right.  All right.  So it's here.  All right.  And I'm pleased to see y'all.  I'm pleased to see y'all this morning.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  What's up, boys?  Oh, hi, Whoopi.  This is so amazing.  She's so amazing.  Oh, man.  This shit is like super...  No, you have no idea.  Patrice, we've been, we've been beating her up the last three days. 
[00:10:00]  She just started doing a radio show here in New York City.  Welcome to New York Radio.  I just saw you the other night, by the way.  Where were you?  I was over at the Stephen King reading.  Was that amazing?  Very, very amazing.  The three of them just, I was loving it.  I was loving it.  And let me tell you something.  I was sitting directly up front.  I like got the, I went through the auction, got, you know, it's a great charity.  Went through, got front row tickets.  Right.  I hear, and now, let's introduce the star of Sister Act and stuff. 
[00:10:30]  Me and my girlfriend looked at each other and went, holy shit.  Fucking Whoopi's coming out.  If she looks down, oh, no.  I didn't expect it.  We were laughing our asses off.  And I said, the next day I came in and said, Whoopi was very funny at that podium.  It was a good night.  It was a good night.  You were in your element.  Yes.  And that was great.  It was very cool.  But the fact you two guys have been shitting on that show, I mean, should definitely now  give you pause because she came in.  Shut the fuck up.  You were right with us.  You're an instigator. 
[00:11:00]  I agree with the word with that.  And the three, just keep eating so you don't even have to talk on this whole thing.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  You know, I knew that I was going to get something from somewhere.  And so I expected, and it was cool.  It was cool.  So, the fleas, what do you call them?  Or the pests.  The pests.  The fleas.  You know?  Well, that's funny.  Why aren't you doing this stuff on your show?  Because my show is geared to women in the morning.  And that's what we're doing. 
[00:11:30]  That's why it's a whole different group.  It's a whole different group.  I didn't talk about it.  It certainly is.  It's a whole different group.  So, I'm trying to be good.  Let's be honest.  Did the One Pest get to you?  I was just sitting there.  You know what?  It didn't get to me until I left the studio.  And there were a couple guys around.  And it kind of, it made me uncomfortable.  Because here's the, I can't hit anybody.  You know what I mean?  So, if somebody comes up to do something, my first instinct is that they're going to hurt me.  Right, right.  So, they freaked me out a little bit. 
[00:12:00]  But no, you know, I'm aware of what you guys do.  You know, I know how you work.  And I've known your show.  You've been around forever.  But everybody knows that.  I know.  You know?  Everybody knows that.  But, you know what?  Why do they have to show up?  You ruined everything.  You really did ruin everything.  God damn it.  We had weeks in us.  I know you did.  I know you did.  September ready to go.  You can always come back when doing it.  But just let me establish the ladies first, please.  Because here's what happened.  And because they jammed the phones, all these women got really pissed off and said, 
[00:12:30]  You know what?  If we can't talk to you, we're not going to listen.  And that kind of flipped everybody out.  She's asking for a truce.  No.  No.  I'm saying to you, you guys have been doing your show for years on both ends.  And I know that a lot of people are concerned.  They say, Why are you doing this?  You know the truth is?  I can't be me and still do the movies I used to do.  Because people are too nervous about it.  They just get paid. 
[00:13:00]  You say one thing, they're like, Oh, we can't work.  You can't say that anymore?  So you have to kind of just sort of...  Whoopi Gibson.  No.  He'll always work.  Yeah.  He'll always work.  But you can't.  You know, so I think to myself, Do I really want to go back and forth to California and beg for work?  And these guys said, You know, we're not afraid.  We'll put you on because we're trying to get to the women.  I said, Cool.  Stay in New York.  Stay home.  Have a good time.  I love you guys.  I know you're out there.  You're silly as hell.  But you always have been.  You always have been.  I hate this. 
[00:13:30]  We have to be right with Whoopi.  No, you don't.  You can actually be yourselves if you want to.  We were so excited.  Hold on.  I got to tell you.  We were so excited that we were going to have a new enemy.  We can't fight with Whoopi.  I know.  Now she comes in all night.  Now we have to go up.  Can we trade Jimmy for Cubby?  I don't know.  But I...  This is all fun, but this is to me what a comic is.  This is what a comic does as opposed to an actor, like a pure actor.  A pure actor would just hide.  A comic just comes out and confronts it. 
[00:14:00]  You know what?  I thought I might...  I thought I might...  Where's your next stop?  Beirut?  Jesus Christ.  If I can...  You know I don't fly.  You war wrecker.  I know.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  But you know what it is?  If you understand what folks do, if you understand the rag and if you know what it is, then you  can sort of deal with it a little bit better.  But if you don't, and actors are sensitive that they're not comics.  They're not comics, and so they don't have the thick skin that we like to think that 
[00:14:30]  we have until somebody messes with us, and then our lips poke out, and then we go, I'm  a good help.  All insecure and stuff.  Yeah.  Down deep, all of us are like really insecure.  So the best way to get around it is to just beat somebody else up.  Aren't we awful people to make ourselves feel better?  But you know what?  It's cool.  We can have our listeners call tomorrow and say how great you are.  No, they won't believe it.  They won't believe it.  But just, if you tell them to call, it's cool to call. 
[00:15:00]  Just don't physically, don't scare me.  By the way, is that guy going to kick our ass?  Yeah, wow.  Who is he?  He looks like he's like, why are you doing this, Whoopi?  He's just waiting for a problem.  No.  Who is he?  This is my company partner.  You cool?  We run our company together.  You cool?  Yeah.  All right.  He's cool.  Yeah.  So I just want to come in and see.  No, he don't like us.  He's like, I told you not to do this.  Get it over with it.  Get the hell out of it.  No, I got to say, should we or should we not?  And the idea of coming up and saying, look, here's what's happening. 
[00:15:30]  We're all trying to make a little dough.  We're trying to make a living, having some fun.  And I thought I figured, again, I felt like I got a lot of telegrams from you to come over and visit.  A lot of people are saying we're scared and stuff.  No.  No, I got to.  What a set of balls on this woman.  She comes in.  We respect people that come to us face to face.  What are you going to do?  What did he want them to hit me?  I know, right?  The woman comes in here and sits down and just starts talking. 
[00:16:00]  The reality is bravo.  I did just grab the mic, didn't I?  I just grabbed the mic and like, okay.  Yeah, that mic's been waiting for me.  Bravo.  Listen, all you listeners, all you ONA listeners, we know that you're out there.  We know you're having a good time.  We know what you're doing.  You got to give the guys kudos, man.  You got to give them kudos.  You can't be pissed that they are respectful.  When I'm respectful to them, they're not going to smack me down.  What do you think they're going to do?  You do a very different show than us, and that's why it's so easy to goof on.  Yes.  And we're not going for the same audience, but you just took away all our fun. 
[00:16:30]  We played your demo tape this morning.  Who the hell are we going to rag on now?  Do we have anybody?  We have to go back to Jim Kerr.  Oh, God.  Not Jim Kerr.  He's on 104.3.  Jim Kerr and the Morning Crew.  Or something.  I have to apologize to Whoopi.  Why?  Why did you say something really bad?  You read it in the paper.  Oh, you call me a bitch.  Yeah.  You know, here's the deal.  But you have to apologize, too.  It's true.  Why?  Why?  Because I said you don't know when I'm...  And here's what I'm talking about. 
[00:17:00]  Who's going to apologize first?  Because you have to apologize, too.  I apologize.  Because you got to us a little bit with the Howard Stern thing.  I'm sorry.  Did I really?  No, no.  No, I didn't.  Full of bananas.  Full of bananas.  We just love seeing our name in the paper.  We're in the paper again today, matter of fact.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, we're publicity whores.  We know it.  Whoopi, I apologize for calling you a bitch.  You know what?  It's okay because it's true.  There are occasions when the biatch comes out of me.  See, you know what it is? 
[00:17:30]  I'm trying to remember all the stuff I'm not supposed to say, but I'm okay because I'm on it.  Oh, it's a satellite.  So I'm like, okay, don't say...  Figure out a better way to say...  It's a lot of new stuff.  Just forget all about satellite radio when you go in tomorrow.  Yes, yes, because when I go in tomorrow, I'll be like...  Hey, motherfucker.  Welcome to Wake Up with fucking Whoopi.  Could get in a little bit of a jam.  I could get in a little bit of a jam.  By the way, that goddamn little theme was stuck in our head all morning.  Which one?  Because we played it all morning.  We played it all morning.  Do we have it here?  Wake up with whoop. 
[00:18:00]  How'd it go?  We don't have it here.  Why would it?  Well, no one knew you were coming.  It's all waking up with whoopi.  You knew.  It's like a little jingle thing.  Is it the jazzy one?  The one that's...  Yeah, it's almost jazzy.  Like almost an old time jingle with a couple of voices in there and stuff.  And it got stuck in our heads.  I'm sorry.  We were cursing you.  Whoopi has no idea what she has started.  The pests are going to turn on us today as soon as she leaves.  Now we're going to get the wrath.  You're kissing her ass.  We're going to get the wrath.  Oh, please.  What's up with you pests? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Pests, get a life.  Be nice.  You've been mean to me.  Wait, wait.  No, I've got to talk to the pests.  I didn't talk to the hand.  Listen.  It's like Mongo.  Don't shoot him.  You'll just make him mad.  Don't do it.  Pests, you have been doing some mean stuff to me down around the building that I'm in.  There's no reason for y'all to walk up on me the way that you have.  Did they?  No reason at all.  So, Pests, I don't mind.  I like the boys.  The boys, they're doing what they're doing.  But y'all don't have to scare, physically scare me. 
[00:19:00]  There's no reason for it.  Don't physically scare.  Whoopi, I've been telling you guys for three days to knock this off.  I could just let other people do their show.  They don't listen because they want to be in the paper and it's hurtful.  Jimmy, could you thank us tomorrow?  Yeah, because for the last three days we gave you a lot of attention on New York Radio.  And I think a thank you is in order.  Didn't you hear me say good morning to y'all?  Because even negative publicity is good.  You know that.  No, it's not.  Sure it is. 
[00:19:30]  No, it's not.  Can I come back sometime?  Yeah.  Okay.  You can absolutely come back.  Do you mind, though, a couple times if you hit on a subject?  Can we just kind of talk about it a little bit?  Please do.  If we're nice.  Please do.  No, and even if you're tearing it to shreds, it's cool.  It's cool.  Thanks for showing the rest of the country that we're a bunch of pussies.  We really are shit talkers anonymously.  We're just cowards.  We get behind the screen door with our mother and yell something and then hide.  That was more of a confrontation when Whoopi Goldberg was in, I would say. 
[00:20:00]  Whoopi came in again after we were making fun of her for a while and she surprised the  show by popping in.  Not as much of a confrontation today when Larry King came in and it was planned.  However, the Larry King get today was a lot more major.  I talked about it at the end of the show today.  If you missed the Larry King thing, if you're just joining us now, yeah, Ron and Fez are  coming back.  And by the way, I do have some questions. 
[00:20:30]  Hopefully we can talk to Ron about his whereabouts last Sunday because I've heard some things.  But if you didn't hear the Larry King interview, you have to hear it.  He was fantastic on the show.  I was able to grab him as he was walking to his next interview.  He did talk to the guys today about when he asked the rape victim what happened to the  groceries and claimed it was a great question.  The one thing the guys didn't ask him about, Opie and Anthony, was the skateboard question,  how important is the board? 
[00:21:00]  A clip that's been played so many times on ONA, we didn't get a chance to ask him about  on the show.  So I had to grab him.  I had to talk to him about the board.  This is me with Larry King right after he was on ONA.  We're here with Larry King.  Larry, you just wrapped up on ONA.  You've got to get a picture with Danny.  I'll take a picture with Danny.  That's right.  I just wrapped up with Opie and Anthony.  Do you want to comment?  Yeah.  What was your experience?  I've been in moments of my career.  You think so?  Fifty-four years in broadcasting and I'd have to say, you can tell how low I'm getting at 
[00:21:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's a highlight.  Well, you said that you were, after the interview you mentioned, hearing the fuck off on a radio  commercial was something.  That's so new to me, it's kind of weird.  I have never heard those words come out of a radio.  There's one more clip that those guys play that you did.  You were talking to a skateboarder once on your show and you asked him how important is  the board.  They've played you asking how important is the board more than almost any clip they've 
[00:22:00]  played.  You don't understand that?  I mean, I do, but for them.  Yes, the jockey.  Who wins the race?  You or the horse?  Okay.  Right?  How important in a baseball player's life is the bat?  How does he choose his bats?  Does he have his bats specially made for him?  Or does he buy stock bats, right?  Yeah.  Gloves.  My kid is 12 years old.  He's ordering a handmade glove for him as a baseball infielder.  How important is the glove to the skateboarder?  How important is the glove? 
[00:22:30]  I meant by that, idiot.  You can buy a $12 board or a $100 board.  Is it the person or the board that makes you good?  Great question.  You make fun of that question?  I don't.  They do.  See, that's Opie and Anthony.  They don't know what they're doing.  They made fun of the groceries.  That was a great question.  They make fun of the board.  It's a great question.  They should have asked me about it.  I can explain it to them.  It requires however it requires intelligence.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, Larry.  You're welcome, guys.  How many people in their lifetimes can say Larry King shoved them and called them an idiot? 
[00:23:00]  Because he did absolutely put his hands on me as he called me an idiot.  Most people, when I'm doing these quick interviews with them, would let it be at that.  But I think this kind of irked Larry King.  He doesn't like that his questions.  So after, I mean, I left the mic on because I'm good at what I do.  He decided to further explain, no, really, this is why it was a good question.  And here's more Larry King, again, explaining why the how important is the board question was a good question. 
[00:23:30]  Thanks so much.  Thanks, Dan.  It's a pleasure.  In other words, two things participate.  Yeah.  Could I, let's take, I'll give you an example.  Do you want to help yourself?  Yeah.  Let's take, you take a great skateboarder, the best in the world, and go into a store and buy him a $20 skateboard.  And take an average skateboarder, good but average, and give him the best board in the world.  Who would you bet on?  I would, it depends on how good the board is.  Ah-ha.  Thanks a lot.  You see, I mean, I'll tell you this. 
[00:24:00]  Larry King came on the show today and said when he, the first time he was broadcasting, he got nervous.  Somebody yelled at him, his boss yelled at him and said, this is a communications business, communicate.  Larry King has learned how to communicate in these past few years because he can spin one of those lame questions any which way.  You don't know where it's going to come from.  As a matter of fact, there was another one.  This is my personal favorite, and since this is my show, I can kind of play what I want, right? 
[00:24:30]  This is my personal favorite Larry King moment ever.  He had the sister of Sharon Tate on the show.  You should know who Sharon Tate is.  She was murdered by the Manson family while carrying Roman Polanski's child.  Sensitive subject.  Larry King was not afraid to broach that topic.  And Opie and Anthony were not afraid to re-air the clip and mock it horribly.  This is Larry King with Sharon Tate's sister.  After ONA Live. 
[00:25:00]  All right, let's go.  Larry King with a huge fuck-up.  Two nights ago, I believe.  Joining Lauren Silver with us now is Deborah Tate, Roman Polanski's former sister-in-law, the sister of the late Sharon Tate,  on a personal note, I knew Sharon Tate had interviewed her a couple months before a tragic murder.  What do you want to see happen?  I would like to see this whole thing go away.  I think that there's been a lot of time that has passed, and we need to bring it to an end.  You ever talked to Roman Polanski?  I have. 
[00:25:30]  Well, how can you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister?  Roman didn't murder my sister.  Holy shit!  Come on!  Did I tell you?  No fucking way he said that.  That's what he said!  That is somebody imitating Larry King.  No, it was straight from the program.  This could be worse than how important is the board, I'm telling you.  That is the worst fuck-up.  I told you.  I've ever...  Not only Larry...  I told you. 
[00:26:00]  Not only Larry King.  That is the worst fuck-up in broadcasting.  I told you.  How could anybody even think that?  That's so brutally murdered you!  It was arguably one of the most...  No, no, no.  It was one of the most famous murders of all time.  And he would almost get away with it if he said murdered, but he had to really punch it  up.  Brutally murdered.  Roman Polanski came into the house and just...  I don't feel that he stole the rights to your sister's song, Helter Skelter.  Let's see how he gets out of this. 
[00:26:30]  You have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister.  Roman didn't murder my sister.  No, I mean, well, I'm sorry, but when he...  The fact that he would have this terrible thing happen to him after the death of your  sister to once again focus you into the public light, that's what I meant.  Uh, I don't have any problems with Roman whatsoever.  That's not what I meant!  He was backpedaling trying to get out of...  He said, okay, Anthony, you do hear the hamadah, hamadah, hamadah, hamadah, hamadah, hamadah. 
[00:27:00]  Oh my God!  He just goes, question one didn't work, I'll just say I meant question two.  That's what I meant.  How about the fact where he's from met a horrible tragic end when Caesar was the...  Is he from Rome?  No!  No!  How could you drink Folger's coffee when she was murdered right next to your sister?  Well, we got Larry King.  He's going to explain himself.  Uh, Larry! 
[00:27:30]  Good morning, shit dicks.  Hey, Larry.  Hey, Larry.  How important is it to get the right murderer?  Let's go to Larry King on line two.  Larry!  Charles Manson's a fine director.  Oh!  Oh!  Larry!  Jacqueline Onassis, how is your first husband doing?  We got Larry King on line three.  Larry!  Larry!  Yes, we were a fan of Charles Manson's movies.  I cannot... 
[00:28:00]  Dude, that froze me.  That made me freeze like, no, that didn't happen.  You couldn't have asked that question.  Look, we might have teased it for over an hour, but man, there's your payoff.  Oh, my God.  There's your payoff.  How about the fuck?  It's just scar healing correctly.  Yeah, how is the baby?  She's dead!  Who's raising the baby?  Who has custody of the baby?  God damn.  But what I really meant was that I paid to her. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  A man who cheated on your sister with a young girl, right?  That's what I meant.  No!  How could you talk to her?  No!  Want to hear it again?  To see this whole thing go away, I think that there's been a lot of time that has passed,  and we need to bring it to an end.  You ever talked to Roman Polanski?  I have.  Well, how can you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister? 
[00:29:00]  Roman didn't murder my sister.  No, I mean, well, I'm sorry, but when he, when he, the fact that he...  What, what is the thing she's saying about, what, what is she, what happened to, what's the brutal, what's the brutal murder, like, what's the thing that she wants to come to an end?  Yeah, yeah, I guess the fact that, that, um, that the Polanski thing is still happening is still, yeah.  Uh, uh, yeah, I mean, the, the, the one he had...  Oh, she's just on here defending, yeah, defending Roman Polanski. 
[00:29:30]  Just leave him alone.  As, as his, uh, you know, cause...  Like, the bitch is probably 60 now that he was fucking, right?  That was too young?  Yeah, yeah.  The bitch doesn't care anymore.  Sharon Tate...  She's, she said in interviews, she don't care anymore.  Sharon Tate's sister is just like, yeah, fucking, uh, Roman Polanski.  It's kind of what they were doing in Hollywood, it sounds like.  There was some shit going on.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  So she's just saying leave Roman alone?  Yeah.  And he says, how can you...  You talk to him?  Right.  How could you talk to a man who so brutally killed 6 million Jews? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  No, what I meant was, his brother, he went to France to get away from, uh, persecution here,  and Hitler, uh, invaded France, and that's what I meant.  I confused him with Hitler.  Sorry.  How do you...  What?  How could you talk to Genghis Khan?  How could you talk to Khan when he's so brutal?  Oh, my God. 
[00:30:30]  In the middle of all this, on Larry King Day, back from parts unknown, shall we say,  it's Ron Bennington, the great Ron Bennington.  Thank you.  I don't even know if that's going to catch on or not, but I appreciate the thought.  I thought that we always had off for Larry Luther King Day.  The fact that we're working today just goes to show you how bullshit this company is.  Yeah, did you enjoy your time off, Ron?  I can't really talk about it, but thanks for asking.  Okay, because Twitter has been buzzing about where you might have been. 
[00:31:00]  That's a direct no comment.  Okay.  It's something I can't talk about.  I would.  It's great to see Obama taking all the credit, whatever.  It doesn't matter to me.  The thing is, mission accomplished.  For whatever you were doing.  For whatever was happening, whatever I did, came out perfectly.  Now, what did you guys think of Larry?  We loved him.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was, I mean, the guys barely even got to bust his chops because he just came in  and he was funny and he was personable and he was, he took the room. 
[00:31:30]  And the funny years of taunting go out the window.  Always.  Oh, of course.  You knew it was going to go that way.  Anybody who really knows Opie and Anthony knew.  Right.  That's how it was going to go.  He was going to come in.  He was going to charm them.  Right.  And they would just be nice to him.  And now they feel like they have a new friend, Larry King.  Larry King is their pal.  Yeah.  Legend in broadcasting.  Well, this is always the worst thing, too, about having anyone on your show.  Then you end up liking them forever and they're in movies and you're like, good.  Good.  The movie's better than everyone's saying.  You know?  I don't know why everybody's smashing this movie. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  It just, it fucking now clouds any critical eye you could possibly have for the rest of  your life.  Yeah.  You know, this isn't getting very good reviews, but I got to say, I think the critics are off.  I think this one is.  And we have a lot of people coming in here that are not pitching very good movies, so.  That is always the problem.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  I mean, it's radio.  It's not television.  Right.  They're not coming in to pitch everything, just the stuff that really needs the extra self.  That's why, yeah, that's why, look, I'm going to do something without pictures.  You know, that's how we got to climb out of this. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Speaking of climbing out of it, you know, I bet my way out of that fucking East Side  Day problem, and now we're in another bet.  I talked to him on special delivery on Saturday and said, look, I'm not trying to rat anybody  out, but somebody is avoiding you.  It's just the opposite.  Now, I'm up.  Oh, boy.  Because we're betting Celtics heat.  Mr. Irish boy takes the Celtics.  He told me he was going Celtics.  Yeah.  2-1 right now.  Well, 17 bucks. 
[00:33:00]  17?  Yeah.  Because you were at 15 before.  Well, we were at 15.  The great thing is, then we went at double or nothing, and I won, and he got it in his  head that he owes me 15.  He doesn't understand the full concept of double or nothing.  The nothing part.  Yeah.  But you let him, you said, okay, yeah, I'll take the 15.  Just fucking pay me and get it over with.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  Well, I mean, I think he's good.  By the way, I don't know where you were.  Did you get tan or something?  I didn't want to talk about it.  Okay.  That's actually what I like to call sandburn.  Sand?  But you don't want to?  No.  Is it weird to have to come back and do a radio show after what you experienced? 
[00:33:30]  You know, I can kind of compartmentalize everything in my life.  I'm able to do that.  Much like Obama was able to do a funny fucking roast, go to the shuttle, be down there for  the tornado victims, and yet still plan a perfect...  This is what we have to do.  This is what adults do.  Adults.  Right.  Did you get to watch Obama's thing on TV?  Which thing?  The speech about Osama bin Laden being killed.  No.  I was in travel at that time. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  That's a little trick question.  Just to get a little information.  He's coming back across the ocean in a Blackhawk, if I'm being fucking totally honest.  We Blackhawked the whole way home.  But you won't say what you were doing.  It doesn't matter what I was doing.  The point is, America, that's all.  That's the point.  Mission accomplished indeed.  Well, I'm so happy that not only is Ron and Fez back, but Ronnie and Sammy Sweethearts is  back.  Dude, I want you to sleep like a baby at night, because it's all taken care of now.  I feel more secure.  Sleep like a baby.  And I'm glad that, you know, now that we have a better idea of what it is that you do... 
[00:34:30]  Hmm?  What I do doesn't matter.  Yeah.  The point is, America, you're welcome.  For whatever it is that you did.  Because a lot of people were upset at first that Ron and Fez wasn't going to be on, until  rumors started circulating about exactly why.  Well, we even had anything to celebrate if I had to be in here?  That's right.  For fucking four hours going, what's the matter, pal?  No.  Well, it's going to be a huge Ron and Fez show, and I'll let you get to that. 
[00:35:00]  You took a week off to do what it was that you had to do.  Let's just say it was a working vacation.  Not a moment of rest for the great Ron Bennington.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. 
[00:35:30]  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
