<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a profane introduction from Larry King, setting the tone for the broadcast.  Anthony was solo in the studio, as Opie was on a secret vacation and Jim Norton was in Los Angeles.  The show heavily featured discussions about Anthony's cluttered apartment and the hosts' hoarding tendencies, specifically focusing on the ubiquitous "junk drawer."  Their TV viewing habits were also discussed, with mentions of *The Walking Dead*, *Hoarders*, *Alcatraz*, *Pan Am*, and *Awake*.  A lengthy segment delved into memories of smoking cigarettes and weed, including detailed anecdotes and discussions on the evolution of weed culture.  The differences between shrooms and acid trips were also explored. This segment was punctuated by a listener call detailing a suspected marijuana overdose involving themselves and their spouse.  Further discussion of a Jim Norton cardboard cutout and its financing concluded this portion.

The show then segued into a caller recounting a severe reaction to homemade marijuana brownies. This was immediately followed by a pre-recorded AmmuNation commercial with Derek the Dodo promoting gun safety in a darkly comedic manner.  The hosts then launched into a graphic and sexually explicit discussion about Hulk Hoganâ€™s sex tape, filled with crude speculation about its contents and Hogan's sexual prowess.  A phone call with Hogan and his lawyer ensued, where Hogan attempted to deflect questions using the phrase "brother."  This section also included discussions about Hogan's memory and the motivations behind the tape's release.  The segment ended with a vulgar and misogynistic discussion about one host's upcoming marriage, relationship arguments, perceived double standards in relationships, and past home videos, one of which was described as "horrifically racist".

The next segment continued the theme of personal relationships, focusing on one host's experiences with his girlfriend,  marked by crude and sexually explicit language.  Challenges of maintaining intimacy with a work-from-home partner, communication issues, and pre-nuptial agreements were discussed.  The host detailed his previous efforts to avoid fatherhood, including faking orgasms and post-coital masturbation.  This was followed by a critique of various reality TV shows (*Pawn Stars*, *Hardcore Pawn*, *Cajun Pawn Stars*, *American Restoration*, *Leave it to Niecy*, *Sweetie Pies*, *My 600-lb Life*, and *Intervention*), frequently using offensive language and disparaging remarks about the shows and their participants.  A potential radio contest involving condoms and urination was also mentioned.

The following segment began with a vulgar and misogynistic discussion of a drug-related scenario.  A complaint about obstructive black tape on the studio window led to a discussion about the show's logo and branding. The hosts then discussed Allison, a former drug user from an intervention show, with Anthony expressing a desire to have sex with her.  A heated debate about *The Walking Dead* and whether prior knowledge of the comic book enhanced the viewing experience followed.  This was briefly interrupted by a very short, irreverent interview with Christian Slater.  The *Walking Dead* discussion continued, incorporating viewer statistics provided by a caller.  The conversation shifted to Bobbi Kristina Houston's Oprah interview and the lack of drug-related questions, leading to further vulgar commentary.  A comparison of the public reaction to Davy Jones' and Whitney Houston's deaths followed, transitioning into a discussion about the relative fame of the Monkees and Whitney Houston.  A video of a perp walk featuring a suspect giving a wrestling-style promo led to a discussion of his assault of his mother and speculation about Hulk Hogan's Google alerts.  Jake "The Snake" Roberts and his substance abuse were also mentioned. The segment concluded with further discussion of the studio tape and promotion of a March Madness bracket challenge involving the Opie and Anthony channel staff and listeners, including Ron and Fez. John Bernthal from *The Walking Dead* arrived late and briefly joined the discussion.

The show featured an interview with John Bernthal, where he discussed his *Walking Dead* death scene, the show's adaptation of the source material, his dislike of working with zombies, the show's lack of job security, and the strong emotional response to his character's death.  He also mentioned spoilers leaked before the season finale and his upcoming role in a new Frank Darabont show.  After the interview, the hosts discussed an off-air interaction between E-Rock and a female comedian met on Instagram.  A heated debate ensued about E-Rock's perceived passivity in the face of criticism from Troy, with allegations of indifference and speculation about jealousy.  Callers offered varied viewpoints on the situation.  The segment ended with discussion of the Jim Norton cardboard cutout.

The final segment focused on E-Rock's perceived lack of witty retorts, speculation about the reasons, and a giveaway of *The Killing* DVDs.  A significant portion was dedicated to promoting a college basketball bracket challenge on SiriusXM, with the hosts discussing their strategies and using playful insults.  Travis chose "Dr. Gay" and Roland "Dick in the Ass" as their bracket names.  The conversation included digressions into personal lives, Instagram, and upcoming guests (Mike Baker, Donald Sutherland, Louis Black, and Amy Schumer), with Troy's use of Instagram to find attractive women for the show being a recurring theme.  The segment was filled with sexually suggestive comments and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hogging.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  Not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  It's just the same fucking music and intros and everything.  And me saying the same thing. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  I got such a good one this morning from him.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  And I had the elevator that opened right across from him.  So I was standing there.  The door is open just to reveal him sitting behind his wooden high school auditorium podium.  So avoiding eye contact is an impossibility.  No, it slid right open and just fucking, come on, welcome aboard, welcome aboard.  He just stares at the elevator doors waiting for them to open so he can lock eyes with someone. 
[00:01:30]  He was waiting for me.  Yeah, that was nice.  Did he have napkins still in his collar?  In his collar from his makeup?  No, he shaves here.  He shaves.  I think it's like one of those guys doing TV shows.  And they got to put the little rags in there to keep the makeup from getting on their clothes.  Their clothes.  Their wardrobe.  Yeah.  Hi, everybody.  Opie and Anthony show.  But my goodness gracious. 
[00:02:00]  Jimmy is in Los Angeles.  Opie's, he's doing the Leno show.  And Opie is vacationing on some faraway island.  I sure ain't going to say where.  No.  No, no.  If E-Rock wants to.  Not like you did for E-Rock's honeymoon.  Yeah, yeah.  If E-Rock wants to, you know, blurt it out, that's fine with me.  But, yeah.  So, yeah.  They all left me.  Bunch of fucking faggots.  I'm on Platoon, right? 
[00:02:30]  O'Neal and the foxhole.  Stop doing a show by yourself, huh?  No.  It's easy.  I do it at home all the time.  Yeah, but you can drink.  Ah, that's right.  I knew something was missing.  The X Factor.  Ah, the alcohol.  We could always make a run.  Yeah, right.  And wait around the corner.  Oh, man.  I can't imagine you drinking this early.  Unless it's overnight.  One of those 24-hour up, still partying, drinking things.  Yeah, because I've come home from your parties. 
[00:03:00]  And then I look at Twitter when I wake up.  Oh, yeah.  And it's like three hours ago.  And we're still partying.  And it's just you and Joe.  Woo!  There are times I've passed out at a party or whatever.  And then, like, it's legitimately the morning.  And the party's still happening.  Like, not like, oh, the sun's come up.  It's the morning.  No, it's fucking 10 a.m.  And people are grilling hamburgers.  And it's like, what the fuck's going on?  I just slept for eight hours.  Hamburgers for breakfast.  Part of any complete breakfast.  Wow, Danny, was that you?  You reaped the fucking room out. 
[00:03:30]  Have you been leaving those?  Did you hear that when I blasted it into the microphone?  Have you been leaving those in the office?  That's a bad one.  Yes, for the last seven years.  Yeah, they're especially terrible this morning.  I'm very sorry.  That is heinous.  I'm surprised it took that long to get across the room.  They must really be solid.  Thick and viscous.  It's like fucking molasses just working its way over here.  Look, I didn't even like that one, to be honest.  Usually I like them. 
[00:04:00]  Everybody likes their own.  It's permeating the room.  I didn't even like that one.  It's permeating the room.  That one didn't even smell like one of mine.  Wow, that's bad.  Well, we have, of course, John Bernthal.  Bernthal is coming in at 935.  I'm saying that because it gives you ample time to watch your DVR or if you want to go to the AMC.  So are you implying that something might happen to his character?  Well, or else would I need to watch my DVR immediately? 
[00:04:30]  Well, if he is going to be talking about the last episode and something did happen, like when, you know, it's not a spoiler at this point because it's two weeks ago.  Of course, we know Dale died.  Dale was killed two shows ago.  How did it happen?  How did it happen?  Did a zombie bite him?  Oh, God bless him.  Give my condolences to him.  Yeah, yeah.  So he's coming in, and I believe he does have a spoiler that we probably will get to. 
[00:05:00]  So if you missed the episode, I suggest you listen to this program and watch Walking Dead with the sound off.  You have three and a half hours to watch.  Yeah, you have three and a half hours to get it in somehow.  That's okay.  I'll tell you what you do, though.  Just fast forward to the last five minutes.  That's all you really need to do.  Or we could just tell him now.  Yeah, we could do that, but I'm not going to do it.  But, boy, they sure leave the shit for the last five minutes, too, on those shows. 
[00:05:30]  But that's been for everything.  Like, even one of my favorite shows ever, Lost, of course, which is great for their cliffhangers and whatnot.  It was always the last five, ten minutes, maybe.  You'd watch the whole episode going, come on, something happened.  And then it's like, oh, something's happened.  And, fuck, look at the clock.  Well, then it's because they put on boring shows but say, no, we're building tension.  Yeah, yeah, it's called building tension.  It's like, no, but how about you make the whole episode un-fucking-believably packed with cool shit? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, like Law & Order, SVU.  Yeah.  There's a twist to every commercial break.  Every commercial break.  Every single commercial break.  There's, like, seven twists per episode.  That must be why there's so many of those shows on.  No downtime at all on that show.  Well, no downtime, no, huh?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  I was watching Hoarders last night.  Holy fuck.  There was a black family on there.  All these women.  All these fat women. 
[00:06:30]  And just infuriating to watch.  They were, if they weren't black, they'd be white trash.  Because that's exactly what happened.  They lived in a trailer.  There were chickens running all over the place.  This woman thought she was making, having chickens make eggs and then selling them.  But she wouldn't sell them.  She left them about the house to rot.  She was hoarding eggs?  In her house.  She was hoarding fucking eggs.  For years?  For years.  At one point, they walked into her house and there were three eggs sitting somewhere. 
[00:07:00]  And they were debating whether those were the same three eggs they saw a month ago.  And then there's cartons of eggs that she would collect from the chickens that were rotting in the carton and smelling the whole house up.  Or the house.  It was a piece of shit fucking trailer.  Were the chickens in the house?  Yes.  The chickens were running around in the house.  And she was so belligerent.  But I love the fact that they just needed to put subtitles up for everything every family member said. 
[00:07:30]  And it was hilarious.  They were talking and just getting words wrong.  I should have jotted a few down because, wow.  I mean, I've heard some words gotten wrong from when Voss was in here.  Well, maybe you don't speak jive.  I don't speak jive.  And that's the problem.  And perhaps that is what they were speaking fluently.  But it was so bad.  Did she sell any eggs?  Not that I saw. 
[00:08:00]  That's the family business, though.  Oh, yeah.  The family business.  We sell eggs.  And then the...  Sometimes.  And it's not like eggs.  Like, I sell eggs on the side of the road.  Like, we need...  It's not like watermelon or like fruits.  Oh, jeez.  What did you do?  No, that's...  I mean, like...  No.  Wait.  Oh, I thought you were joining in.  I thought you were getting in the spirit.  Sam Roberts.  When you sell crops on the side of the road, it's like fresh corn, fresh watermelon.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Eggs is just eggs.  Nothing about this was fresh, by the way.  And then they're saying, look, you can't eat this. 
[00:08:30]  It's...  They're rotten.  And she goes, I cook them up for my dog.  If you cook them, they'd be okay.  Oh, good.  She has dogs, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Plenty of dogs, cats.  You know, those hoarders.  They love their fucking animals to run around and get everything all fucked up.  But then at the end of the episode, she's been belligerent the entire episode.  And then she kind of gets nicer to the family that helped her clean everything up.  Then they realize there's structural damage on the piece of shit trailer she lives in. 
[00:09:00]  And she can't live in it anymore.  So it's like, oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Everything just sounds like a fucking Baptist church at that point.  They're all, oh.  So we have to throw out, like, all this stuff and also your whole house.  And your whole home, which to me has always been the solution to hoarders.  Burn it to the ground.  Burn it down.  Just haul it away.  Back a fucking tractor trailer up.  Hitch it up and take it away.  Yeah.  And where that piece of shit trailer full of shit was will now just be an empty lot.  And that's where you live.  And now you live there.  Pitch a tent, motherfucker. 
[00:09:30]  But they didn't because a fine gentleman that owns, like, a place that sells used trailers, I guess,  brought a fucking big, big-ass trailer just to fill it up with more chicken shit.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I was thinking.  It's just going to be a shitty house again.  But he backs it in and gives it to her.  And I'm thinking, you know, again, here comes charity and what I like to call welfare.  Here comes a new space to hoard. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, to make a shitty hoard in.  But it's like, you know something?  I've seen this show plenty of times.  And, boy, they never give anyone a new house.  Never give anyone a new fucking house.  They're kind of starting to do this, like, little, like, makeover thing at the end.  Like, that chick with the toilet full of shit.  The toilet, oh, shit, yes.  The end of the episode, they completely redid her house.  Yeah, brand new toilet.  And they never used to do that.  No.  It was just like, all right, you know, we'll see you later.  Yeah, they'd clean up, but they would leave the same shitty toilet in there.  They'd probably be trying to, like, get more of the women watching who need the feel-good moment at the end. 
[00:10:30]  The move this bus!  And everybody sees the new house.  Yeah.  They've made a few adjustments.  Like, they're starting to tease things at the beginning.  Oh, yeah.  You know, and then.  Yeah, they tease it, and then they go, like, three days earlier.  Three days earlier.  And they show, you know, the people.  Why would they do that, though?  Why would they give hoarders, like, a brand new, fresh house to fuck up?  Yeah, I know.  That's exactly what they did.  And they're just like, oh, this is great.  I love my house now.  And I'm just looking at every room going, this is going to be shit. 
[00:11:00]  She's going to stack more eggs in it.  Yeah, eggs and chickens are going to be running around.  Why don't you just send an addict to live in a house built out of cocaine?  And then say, no, don't do any.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Because it's a fresh, clean, empty house to just throw more shit in.  You think they would just, do they give them treatment now?  Oh, yeah, they always get treatment.  But they never stick with it.  No.  I mean, hoarders, I think, are worse than, like, alcoholics or drug addicts with not being able to, not having that treatment take. 
[00:11:30]  After a while, they just go, I got to buy something.  I got to put my house up.  I thought I was hoarding a little bit.  I had so much garbage.  Like, we just had that conversation last week about computer equipment and such.  And I've been holding on to so much old shit for no reason.  I just threw out a ton of stuff yesterday.  And that's when I realized, I'm like, I don't think I have any hoarding problems because I have no attachment to any of that shit.  And I'll never think about it again.  Yeah, see, that's what it is.  Are you freaked out by throwing it away?  I'm not.  I'm just too lazy to go through this shit.  I had clothes that, like, I dumped in one of those, like, you know, the Goodwill bins or whatever. 
[00:12:00]  And, like, this is clothes that I had dragged from apartment to apartment to apartment.  And then I'm just like, why do I have this still?  I'm 30.  And I just threw it away.  For years.  Yeah, the dragon shit along with you for years.  I understand earlier on, especially when I had nothing, you know, it's all you got.  So you kind of drag it along with you.  But after a while, you just start not moving it to new places.  But I have boxes of stuff still that have writing on them from where I had moved previously. 
[00:12:30]  I haven't opened them in years.  Why the fuck would I need anything in there?  We moved in May.  We have two boxes left of just stuff.  And I know that it can probably go.  Yeah.  You know?  When Justin and me moved, we were living in one apartment for a year and a half.  There were actually boxes from the move before that that we just moved to this apartment.  What?  You know what?  If you haven't opened it, just throw the whole fucking box away. 
[00:13:00]  Like, oh, well, we'll just put this right there.  Good.  It's ready to go.  Yeah.  I hate the box.  But do you guys have this?  Because I have, like, three of these boxes in my closet where it's just, like, the Levens box.  Where it's just, like, there's no way to define what's in the box.  Stuff.  Yeah.  It's just stuff.  It's just stuff.  I have, like, three boxes full of just papers and stuff.  You know what you do?  Oh, what is that?  Write a little misc on there.  A little misc.  Just toss it in there.  Let me just pop an H on here so we all know that there's hornets.  You know what?  You know what it is, too? 
[00:13:30]  We completely learn how to move from our parents and watching the parents move.  Because it's the same dumb shit written on the box.  Like you said, misc.  The only reason you'd know to write that is because you saw dad or mom write it on a box when they fucking move.  And it was a bad idea when they did it.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it never got opened.  There's nothing in it.  No.  Where are you supposed to put the stuff in the stuff box?  I don't understand.  Like, it's like ticket stubs and a measuring tape.  Yeah.  Like, where does this go?  Contents of junk drawer. 
[00:14:00]  Junk drawer.  Junk drawer.  All my drawers are junk drawers.  Like, what do you think I organize shit with other drawers?  We've somehow accumulated three junk drawers in our kitchen now.  So, like, my chick will be like, oh, can you get the masking tape?  I'll be like, where is it?  She's like, the junk drawer.  I'll be like, which junk drawer?  Junk drawer number one?  Two or three.  Your choice.  But that's also what happens when you're moving.  Like, you start out.  You're like, okay, I'm going to.  Everything's all together anyway.  I'll just put it in the boxes.  And you start with shirts and then pants.  And then within three hours of moving, you're like, MISC one, MISC two, MISC three. 
[00:14:30]  And you're just pouring everything.  I have, like, above my sink, like, there are these little cubbies, sort of.  And I was just like, I'm going to take advantage of this.  When I moved in, I'm like, I'm going to put important things here and bills there.  I probably have, like, my car insurance paperwork from the day I moved in.  It's been sitting there.  And I haven't touched anything else since.  Well, that's how junk drawers start.  Like, we put all of, like, you know, our quote-unquote hardware stuff into a drawer.  And then one day I was just like, oh, let me put this in there, too.  When you say we, you mean you and your partner?  Yes.  Your partner. 
[00:15:00]  Your life partner.  And you say, all right, well, I got some extra room in this drawer.  Let me put this in there, too.  Let me put this in there, too.  I was literally just like, at first it was like, keep everything together.  And then it was like, well, everything that's on this shelf, I'll just put on another shelf.  So I'll just dump it all in one box.  Everything that's in this drawer, I'll just put top shelf.  Yeah, top shelf.  Drawer.  Closet.  Yeah.  It's, again, the junk drawer isn't complete, either, until it gets something in it that  prevents it from opening.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you got to. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes it really gets in there where you can't even open it a quarter inch enough to  get your hand in there to push the obstacle down.  And then you just, you lost the drawer.  Right.  You got to get in there with a hanger.  You lost your keys in your car.  You just lost the fucking drawer.  You go, fuck it.  And then you say, well, next time I want to open it, I'm sure it'll open.  Yeah.  It's fine.  I'll just start a new junk drawer.  Yeah.  Ah, look at that, huh?  All right.  Any guests today, or is it three and a half hours of this shit?  Bye! 
[00:16:00]  That's it.  First of all, you're on PalTalk, so technically you're listening for nothing.  Yeah.  And now you're bounced.  So you don't listen at all now.  And anybody else wants to complain?  I'll just close the whole room down.  What is that?  Oh, man.  And that gets him really pissed off.  Have you done it before?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I wield an iron fist.  Good.  I don't fuck around, as they say.  It's not like conversation is happening that hasn't happened on this show in the past.  I know!  Hoarding conversations happen all the time.  Hoarding conversations. 
[00:16:30]  I don't think we've ever spoken about junk drawers.  I mean, for the love of God.  I also like that you run that, though, like a dictatorship.  It's like, no, only positive press about your leader.  The emperor's new clothes.  Say they are beautiful.  Do you look gorgeous?  Yeah, please.  It's typical internet behavior.  I know.  It's just like, oh, all this stuff for free that I'm going to complain about.  Yeah, yeah, free stuff.  Let me bitch.  All this knowledge and power that I'll just pretend is not a big deal.  Yeah.  You suck. 
[00:17:00]  Fuck this, you stink.  Go fuck your mothers.  I stayed in the city last night, which is...  New York City.  It's a treat.  Yes.  Wow.  In New York City.  Wow.  Not Garden City.  All by myself, too.  Did you visit the Today Show?  No, I didn't go.  I went to the Museum of Natural History.  No, I didn't do anything.  All by yourself.  All by myself, I stayed in it.  It was scary.  It was like big.  I was crying.  I was on the bed crying at the sirens and gunfire.  Yeah, and you just sit there licking Oreos.  Did you get to be on top? 
[00:17:30]  Bunk?  Yes.  Okay.  But I could top.  Yeah.  How come you're all by yourself?  It's...  Well, I just figured, why go all the way out to Long Island when I could sleep in late  for the show?  He's a mile past Queens.  He doesn't want to drive all the way out to Long Island.  I know.  And it just shows my absolute laziness.  He's acting like it's fucking George in the car with his girlfriend's parents driving  out to Montauk.  Going out to Montauk. 
[00:18:00]  Not to the Hamptons.  Snoopy and Prickly Pete.  But this is also, by the way, his rationale is the same way hoarder behavior starts.  Eventually, you just won't be in your house anymore.  I just won't be there.  Well, I just do this every day.  I never have to sleep in every day.  It'll be a storage room.  Yeah.  A whole storage house.  I don't understand, too, because from the time I wake up on Long Island and then get  ready, get in the car and drive here, it doesn't seem to work out time-wise to how much more 
[00:18:30]  time I have to sleep when I stay in the city.  It's like less time to sleep still.  And I don't know why.  I should have a good 40 minutes of extra sleep when I stay in the drive.  Because that's how long everything is.  But it's not.  No.  Well, I think you're supposed to go to bed before four in the morning.  Oh, is that what happens?  I think then you get more of the sleep that you're talking about.  Damn it.  No, I was a pretty good boy last night, too.  I didn't go to sleep too late.  There wasn't really anything good on television, and my life revolves around TV. 
[00:19:00]  And if you stay in the city, you had Time Warner, so.  I was ready to throw the fucking remote through the television.  Now it's doing this fun thing where it just freezes.  You know what you need, honestly?  And I didn't mean to interrupt.  Yeah, it's cool.  But a sling box.  Yes.  Because that way, all you have to deal with is Time Warner's internet.  But then you can get rid of their cable box, sling your Fios from your house, and just 
[00:19:30]  put it on a TV that no one's on, like one of the boxes that no one's using, and just  sling that shit to your apartment in the city.  Have fucking Fios.  You know what, and it's not the internet that's bad with Time Warner.  It's the fucking cable.  I hate their cable.  I was watching a bunch of the great shows that I watch.  The fat people trying to lose weight.  Former fat people getting skin cut off of them.  And the Time Warner thing now, the new thing, the screen just freezes, and the sound stops.  So you get a screen freeze and stop sound, and then it'll jump ahead maybe 10 seconds 
[00:20:00]  and start moving again for maybe 30 seconds, and then it freezes again.  And I was yelling in my apartment going, fucking Time Warner!  Fuck!  I noticed last night I record Alcatraz, because I'm a couple episodes behind, and it just wasn't  going to record last night's episode if I hadn't caught it.  Oh, really?  In time, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  And why the fuck?  It's scheduled to record, but it just didn't feel like recording.  It decided not to.  No.  No, there's no red bar on that one.  It's not out of space?  No, it's not out of space.  It didn't forget to record the series, because then I clicked on it, and it's like, control  series options.  Is it a new episode?  Yeah, of course it is.  It says new.  It says new right there.  Yeah, of course.  I kind of bailed on that show.  I like it.  I kind of bailed on it.  It's good enough.  And at this point, I'll take it.  You know what?  There's so many shows that just suck. 
[00:21:00]  Like, I'll take it at this point.  It's good enough.  I kind of bailed on it.  How do you decide to, like, keep watching a show?  Like, I can't commit to, like, a half-good show.  If there's a little bit of mystery in a show, I'll be like, oh, please be the next Lost.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  At that point, though, I would just be like, all right, what's on the Discovery Channel?  And I'll just sit there and watch how they make saw blades for the eighth time.  I like a good drama.  Like, I started DVRing.  Yeah, a good drama, though.  Well, and this one's okay.  I don't know.  You know what it is?  It's a Fox drama. 
[00:21:30]  Like, it's not, like...  Yeah, here's what I get from that show.  Yeah.  Here's what I get from that show.  There's that underlying, you know, fucking weirdness theme.  Mm-hmm.  And then the rest is pretty much, what, a cop show?  Yeah, like, they've got to keep it serialized where, like, you know, there's self-contained episodes.  And that's exactly like the other news show that's on.  What's that one?  Where the guy has...  Where he wakes up.  Oh, awake?  Yeah, awake.  I started DVRing that, too. 
[00:22:00]  He's with his wife, who died in a car accident.  And then when he goes to sleep and thinks he's dreaming, he's with his son.  But maybe that's real life and where he's with his wife is a dream.  Or maybe both of them are reality in some way, shape, or form.  But they're never in the same place at the same time.  One of his lives, the wife lived through the accident.  The other life, the son lived through the accident.  And he's with two different strengths.  And they're two different worlds, really.  And there's two different Wilmer Valderamas, too.  Right.  Wilmer Valderamas.  So they made Donnie Darko into a television show? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, it's pretty much...  It's this weirdness like that.  But, again, it's this underlying theme of fantasy kind of thing.  And then the rest is just cop show.  You've got your big mystery.  Then every day, every episode, you have the cop show.  I think that's because shows that tried to copy Lost and be too deep into mythology, like Flash Forward or whatever it was.  But Lost was one of a million.  And the other ones tried to do it, and they didn't do it well, and they lost viewers. 
[00:23:00]  So now they're doing part of the show is mystery, weirdness thing, and then the rest is cop show?  I think they're trying to do more of an X-Files formula where there was always that broad mythology.  Mulder's missing sister.  Yeah, exactly.  And the UFOs.  But sometimes they would do like five episodes without talking about anything that had to do with the broader stuff.  I hated when they did that on the X-Files.  I wanted every episode to have that thing in there.  Did they just cancel some of those shows that are trying to be like Lost?  Like there was that Terra Nova that got canceled, right? 
[00:23:30]  And there was another one, too.  They canceled Flash Forward.  What was that other one that ABC just put out where it looked like they were trying to make it look like fucking Lost?  Lost Heroes?  No.  Oh, um, um, um.  The ads.  You know what I'm talking about.  What Oren Peli did?  Yeah.  The lake or the river or some shit like that.  Oh, the river, the lake, the body of water.  Oh, what did that do?  Like the flu?  The flu?  I don't know.  They were trying to make it look mysterious, like Lost, and that didn't work. 
[00:24:00]  And today.  Oh, dude, it's absolutely terrible.  Oh, God.  Now I got to blockade.  Hey, Jimmy's not here.  I got to fucking step up.  It shows up my nose.  Yeah, I like Alcatraz.  Every season I pick one drama that I'm going to DVR the whole season based on the commercials.  So starting with the premiere.  Oh, I've got one of those.  Regardless of whether it's good or not, this, I'm going to watch the whole season.  Last season it was Pan Am.  Oh, God, that's right.  You were watching Pan Am, you fruit. 
[00:24:30]  My chick watches that.  I didn't like it.  One of the worst TV shows.  I've never watched it, but that was a great concept, I thought.  Great concept.  No.  Great concept.  It wasn't.  What?  Because it's just those sexy stews.  It turned into a spy show.  Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.  It was completely different than what you were doing.  I thought it was just about sexy stews from back in the day.  Well, that's why I jumped on and said, I'm going to watch the whole season.  And then it turned out, first episode, one of the stewardesses gets tapped by the FBI to be a spy, an international spy. 
[00:25:00]  Christina Ricci?  Not that one.  And it was just weird.  Yeah, it was stupid.  It didn't make sense.  Who pitched that one?  I don't know.  Where they all of a sudden just said, oh, okay, we're changing direction of the show.  But you know what?  That show on the surface, it really sounds like a home run.  It's like, all right, we're going to do Mad Men on a plane with stewardesses.  And I'm like, sign me up.  That sounds like a fucking great show.  So how did they possibly fuck that up so hard?  They made it a spy show.  I know what I'm saying. 
[00:25:30]  But why couldn't you just run with the original bit?  What was so problematic with that?  I think they got scared and said we need either a police element or a spy element or an FBI element.  Awake is the new show, though.  Yeah, I haven't started much.  Pan Am's over.  I'm sure it's not going to get another season.  And then there's Playboy Club.  Is that the other one?  That last is gone, right?  Retro.  Yeah.  Two episodes maybe.  That was another one that was supposed to be like this retro thing where, okay, let's do a period piece like Mad Men.  Yeah.  But that show is pretty good because that's got like, they really got that shit down. 
[00:26:00]  Mad Men's good.  Yeah.  The look and the whole everybody smoking and drinking at every turn.  Anytime there's any crisis whatsoever back then, people just picked up a drink.  I love that idea that in people's offices there were bars.  And everybody's fucking around and they got new dress shirts in their drawers.  Yeah, yeah.  They got to keep a change of clothes.  Lipstick stains off of them.  We watched the first episode like two weeks ago because we just decided this is the show that we should maybe give it a shot. 
[00:26:30]  And even three years after quitting smoking, I'm watching that show saying this is going to be really hard to watch.  Oh, yeah?  You think people are picking up smoking because of it?  No, but it just reminds you of how much fun smoking is.  Yeah.  I have a hard time watching The Last Boy Scout with Bruce Willis and What's-His-Face because every scene there's someone lighting a cigarette.  It's almost as if every scene ends, Bruce Willis flicks a cigarette and then a new scene begins and he has to light one up because when I was quitting smoking, that fucking movie was the worst. 
[00:27:00]  The absolute worst.  It makes you want to smoke, yeah.  The Mad Men, though, it's old school smoking.  So it makes you like, oh, God, it was so cool to smoke back then.  And that's when it was healthy.  Yeah, it was great.  And you could smoke anywhere.  You weren't relegated to the door in front of fucking work.  And you're not even supposed to smoke in front of the doors.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah, move away in between the building and the door. 
[00:27:30]  They post signs where no smoking beyond this point.  I kind of like that, though, because I hate walking out of the building and getting a big fucking cloud of smoke in my face.  And as a former smoker, I am one of the worst because I think people that used to smoke are worse than people that never smoked when it comes to smoke flying in their face.  And it isn't because I want to smoke.  It's not like, oh, boy, that's deliciousness being blown in my fucking face.  It's just I hate it now.  Yeah.  I hate the fucking wafting smoke. 
[00:28:00]  And you look at smokers and go, what are you doing?  Stop it.  How do you afford that?  How do you afford it?  What are you doing?  You're killing yourself.  But they got no place else to go now.  I know.  They got to just let them smoke outside.  They got no place to go.  There was some lawmaker in California a couple of weeks ago who wants to ban smoking in your own backyard.  In your own backyard because the, I guess, the smoke like it's over to you.  It'll waft over.  Yeah, it'll waft over to your neighbors.  But it's in the air.  Ah, see?  We were ragging when they said you couldn't smoke in stadiums. 
[00:28:30]  It's like, why?  It's open air.  But then you realize the guy next to you, the breeze is running in that direction.  You know, it's the funniest thing.  I'm like, I can't believe I'm the same person that I was when I was smoking because there was a guy.  I was getting off the train and he was walking to our car.  He's a few steps in front of me.  Lights up a cigarette right in front of me.  I just got a huge, you know, I basically took a drag of his cigarette.  Yeah.  And in my head, I'm going, I'm a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  But five years ago when I was smoking, I must have done that a thousand times a day to people.  And I never cared.  And if it was a problem for them, it's like, fuck you, walk somewhere else. 
[00:29:00]  I'll see people get off the subway and take a cigarette out.  And like, they're not even up the stairs yet.  And they're already lighting.  And I'm like, that used to be me.  Like, I can't wait.  I can't wait 10 seconds to get outside to smoke my cigarette.  And it just became such a pain in the ass.  When I quit, it was already getting bad where you couldn't smoke in a lot of places.  But, I mean, I do remember the days.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you could smoke anywhere. 
[00:29:30]  I remember my dad smoking a cigarette while he was wheeling me around in the shopping cart.  Yeah.  And the supermarket.  Supermarket.  And the ashes, like, fell off a cigarette and burned my hand.  It must have been, like, two or three.  I remember that.  It was just an open flame everywhere.  It's really just people fucking an open flame walking around everywhere you go.  You remember going to the arcade?  And, like, you'd open the door and just stale, billowing smoke would pour out.  And it's not that long ago. 
[00:30:00]  No.  I worked at a...  I tried farting out the door.  That never worked.  But then I brought some back in.  I'm sorry.  But I'll tell you, there was so much of it, though, that you're very lucky I didn't like that.  Oh, God.  You just got...  You got, like, the spillage.  Wow, it's bad.  Oh, God.  It's like Parmesan.  Meatball Parmesan coming out of the ass.  I don't know what happened.  I'm so sorry.  What do you mean, what happens?  It's every day.  It's never like that every day.  What do you fucking eat?  I think it was Blue Moon. 
[00:30:30]  I switched beers.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  Blue Moon is very gassy.  The hospitals, smoking in hospitals is, to me, is like the ultimate.  That's what you call the day, because that's got to be the first place they said, ah, probably  should cut out the smoking in a hospital.  That, and I remember McDonald's having the little tinfoil ashtrays.  The little tin ashtrays that you could just sit there and smoke.  Yeah, and, like, you could look over, and there's the ball pit with all the fucking four-year-olds,  and you're just like, ah, let him play. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, as you take a big drink, there's that slimy nicotine shit all over the balls in  the ball pit.  I don't know if that's nicotine stuff.  Oh, maybe not.  The little fella.  The, uh, and airplanes had to be another one where it's like, ah, just stop.  Just stop.  Like, and the smoking, like, the smoking sections always never made sense to me.  That was going in, like, a restaurant.  Yeah, like an IHOP, like a small IHOP having a smoking section.  It's like, what the fuck's the point?  That wasn't even that long ago.  Smoking or non-smoking.  Yeah, you'd be like, oh, yeah, non-smoking.  And it's right next to the smoking section. 
[00:31:30]  They shouldn't even edit.  They should just be like, do you want to get yelled at for lighting a cigarette or not?  Like, that's what the smoking section really is.  Yeah, but they, uh, they show that on Mad Men, and that's what kind of makes you want to  smoke again.  Not, not, like, just watching people smoke doesn't do it.  It's being able to smoke in that atmosphere.  I loved smoking at a bar.  Like, that's the best is just sitting there with a beer and a cigarette.  Uh, the beach, not so much.  Never a beach smoker. 
[00:32:00]  You can never tell if your cigarette was lit.  Like, it'd be windy at the beach, and the, and the, the ash would go way inside the cigarette,  and the paper isn't burnt, but you're smoking the tobacco inside, and it just didn't taste  right.  And then the paper has to catch up with the burning, so, so there's this giant piece of  paper that just flies in your eye once it's done.  That's why you gotta, you gotta lick your pinky.  Yeah.  And it, it's called canoeing.  Like a gym, yeah.  It would canoe like a bad, badly rolled joint.  I love smoking at the beach, though, because you could put it out anywhere.  Yeah, yeah, but your world is an ashtray. 
[00:32:30]  I hated that, because then you're walking around the beach, and you get cigarette butts  between your toes, and you go, that's fucking shitty, so I'm not gonna do that.  Yeah, those nasty, hard, rock-hard filters.  Something would happen, they'd mutate on the beach.  Yeah, the canoeing, the canoeing joint, and you'd have to literally spit on your finger  and just dab it, keep it from burning up one side.  Joints are so ridiculous to me to smoke anywhere, because it's like, if you're trying to get 
[00:33:00]  all that goodness in you, why would you want to roll it up in something that's just gonna  be wasted, like, half the time?  I mean, half the time, you're not smoking a joint.  Think about it.  Like, it's, it's smoking and burning and wasting.  It's just burning away.  You're just, it's just money going away.  I kind of liked it, because it was better than, it was just more convenient than a  pipe.  Pipe is like, ah, you go, hey, is there anything left in it?  No, it's on screen, let me figure it out.  You gotta clean it every so often.  Fuck it.  Well, it's better than half your weed burning away into the atmosphere?  Yeah, but the joints would never fucking stay lit anyway. 
[00:33:30]  I don't know about your weed these days, but I know occasionally it would be like, like  one of Bugs Bunny's cigars he would give Yosemite Sam when a seed would explode.  And the whole fucking thing would just, like, weed would go flying.  Yeah, seeds?  What are those?  You're supposed to plant, save those, put them in a jar.  I don't even know if weed has seeds anymore.  Like, they've bred the seeds out of, like, jars now.  Yeah, it's bred, it's all bred out.  If you get a seed, it's because you're smoking, like, male plants.  Yeah, like, you and I would have no idea what to do if we decided to get back into smoking 
[00:34:00]  weed.  It's so far past, like, uh, give me a dime for $10.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not that anymore.  If you can buy weed for $10, I don't want to be in the neighborhood that you're in.  Yeah, you used to buy it from white people that were friends of yours.  A dime was $10 and a nickel was $5.  And a nickel bag would get you at least five joints.  Yeah.  What?  Yes.  It was amazing.  Five joints for five bucks because a joint was a dollar in school. 
[00:34:30]  I know there was always that kid that walked around with the Marlboro box.  I'd be like, yeah, what do you need?  And you'd get to pick your own.  You know, he'd give you the boxes, the Marlboro box.  You'd open it up.  There were joints in there.  And you'd be like, yeah, you'd squeeze one.  Yeah, that's good.  It's like you're fucking shopping for vegetables.  Yeah, that's good.  Let me shake that.  It's ripe.  Ripe on the outside.  Yeah, and you'd give him a buck and that was a joint.  And then for a nickel bag, why would you buy a nickel bag if you weren't getting at least  five joints when you could buy five joints with five bucks?  So you'd get like maybe six, seven joints out of a nickel bag. 
[00:35:00]  A dime, you'd get, you know, maybe 15.  And then I don't think I could ever afford more than a dime bag back then.  No, now it's like $20 for like this little nugget in the glass drawer.  Oh, 20 bucks.  But let me tell you, you could smoke like half a hit and you would be fucked up.  I don't even, like, I don't even remember the last time I saw a nickel bag.  A nickel bag.  Like that has to be, for me, junior high school was 17 years ago.  Like that's the last time I saw one. 
[00:35:30]  And it didn't come in specialty little Ziploc bags like that.  Like they put one little piece of bud in a postage stamp size baggie now with a little Ziploc on it.  Like this, the nickel bag went in the same sandwich bag as a fucking four finger lid.  That is your, that is your standard $20 bag.  20 bucks.  See, even, it's crazy.  That's like the size of your fingernail.  That's a fingernail size piece of weed.  20 bucks. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, but three for 50.  Oh shit.  Well, okay.  Then I'm in.  That's the shit that'll get the sunglasses smacked off your face through your car window.  That shit, you can't buy that from white people.  I wouldn't even know what to do if I decided to.  I don't know.  I got into puffing a little weed maybe years ago, and it was, you know, the new weed.  And I was like, no.  The one the kids are talking about.  Yeah.  I was like, no, this shit is way out of control.  You just can't base it on that, though, because there's so many. 
[00:36:30]  Come on, professional broadcaster.  What are we doing here?  I have to shut that off.  This is a radio show?  I have to shut that off.  Yeah, you can't base it on like old weed.  Well, you can't base it on new either because there's so many different kinds.  Like, it's not, it's completely a gourmet situation these days.  It's not like, hey, I'll have a cup of coffee.  It's like, let me get a chai venti weed.  It's like that where, let me get an extra hot, no foam joint, please.  When did that happen?  Like, what happened to weed where it wasn't just weed? 
[00:37:00]  And specialty weed was like, oh, I got some fucking Acapulco gold.  I got me some, look, it's got red hairs in it.  I think, you know what it is?  There was this weird crossover when it became okay to be a little bit of a geeky nerd person.  And I think it brought some of that, that subculture kind of got down into like the weed people too.  And they said, hey, it's cool to learn about stuff.  And then they said, I'm going to read about and learn how to grow better weed.  Because technology has improved where, just like computers, like, it doesn't cost all that much to get awesome shit these days. 
[00:37:30]  So people read up and all of a sudden you got all these different strains and all these gourmet flavors.  They became weed snobs.  Yeah, and it affects you differently.  Like certain weeds get you body buzz.  Certain weeds give you a mental thing.  Sometimes people want to sit on the couch for hours at a time and they'll smoke specific types of weed to get the effect that makes them want to sit on the couch.  If I wanted to get into this now, though, I would have to research this.  There would be so much you would have now. 
[00:38:00]  What kind of weed do I want?  Yeah, you want some granddaddy perp?  Oh, I just want some weed.  You want some cheese?  And do they all get you paranoid still?  No.  I never got paranoid on weed.  What?  Never.  I only got paranoid back when I was a kid, but now I don't even know what you're talking about.  Danny and I were swapping acid stories last week.  That's something that I haven't touched acid in a fucking really long time.  Damn.  But I don't want to touch it anymore.  No. 
[00:38:30]  No.  No, it wasn't fun.  Yes, it was.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Acid, not fun.  It was an experience.  I don't know if I'd call it fun.  And maybe back then it was fun, but thinking of it in hindsight and what it would be now  would just be crazy.  Like, no, why would you do this?  We should have acid day on the show.  Yeah, let's take some acid.  Yeah, yeah.  Today.  Yeah, today.  Let's just drop some fucking acid, everybody.  And we'll give some of what's-his-name from Walking Dead, too.  We can all have some fun.  Yeah, before his big spoiler. 
[00:39:00]  He's going to tell everybody that didn't watch yet.  Shrooms I'd still eat, but not acid.  Acid's too hard.  Because shrooms, at least you can control your intake.  Yeah.  If you're not feeling like you're tripping hard enough, just eat some more shrooms.  Acid, you have a drop of it, and you're like, okay, well, I'm insane for the next 12 hours.  That's that.  There's always the catch-up factor, though, where you're like, I'm not feeling anything.  Let me take a little more.  And then it starts hitting you, and you realize, uh-oh, uh-oh, let's see.  If my calculations are correct, I'm going to be 10 times more fucked up than right now. 
[00:39:30]  Danny doesn't have a face anymore.  Well, that is kind of how it works.  Because, like, I remember I was watching some awful movie, and I really felt like that.  Like, ah, these shrooms aren't that great.  It's not doing anything.  And then I blinked.  And when I opened my eyes, there were veins on the TV.  And I'm like, oh, no, no, it's working.  It's working.  It's working.  It's just fine.  And veins on the TV don't freak you out?  No, because you know.  It doesn't freak you out.  Because that right there is the difference between shrooms and acid.  Acid, you're going, oh, my God, there's veins on the TV.  But shrooms, you're going, oh, my God, there's veins on the TV. 
[00:40:00]  I don't think it could ever be cool.  I don't think I'd ever be cool with that.  No, it's cool.  Because you just go, eat some shrooms.  I'm going to shit them out.  Everything's cool.  Acid is like, this is forever.  This is forever.  Never ending.  But shrooms, it just keeps you on that, I know this is all going to be fine later.  It's just all a mental.  It's all going to be fine.  Mental weirdness.  I had, like, for instance, I went once to a bar.  And, like, if you're doing any kind of harder drugs, I'm not going to call acid or shrooms like hard drugs. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, pretty hard drugs.  It's hard.  But, like, you shouldn't be in, like, social situations that you might not be comfortable in.  Because I had some shrooms and I went to this bar.  And it was just a bunch of people I didn't want to see.  And I knew it was time to leave.  When we, I was in the bathroom and I was pissing.  And you know those, the urinal cakes?  But not the cakes.  Just the plastic.  You know, where it's just, like, some kind of pee filter for some reason.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what that's all about.  It was kind of curly.  Splatter guard.  Yeah, it was kind of curly and shriveling. 
[00:41:00]  But as I was watching it, as I pissed on it, to me it was just, like, curling and kind of, like.  It was moving.  It was moving and vicious for my piss.  And I'm just, like, staring at my pee stream going, I can't be here on drugs.  What, are you crazy?  That'll freak out.  That'll freak out.  We walked into an IHOP once and immediately left because we were convinced that everyone  knew we were on acid.  Yeah, it's another thing with acid.  You just think everyone knows that you're on acid.  Two guys walking, acid.  It's like fucking Ancient Aliens guy. 
[00:41:30]  You know what you don't see anymore, either, is homegrown weed.  No, you do see it.  It's just you don't see it here.  Well, it's got to be grown at home somewhere.  Even fucking Colombian weed is grown at home there.  Some states, you know, some states are more liberal with it, and some states are really straight.  I don't even mean homegrown like that.  I mean, like, your buddy would get some seeds, plant it, and then in his backyard grow some  weed, and then, you know, it would be, it wouldn't look like real pot because it would 
[00:42:00]  just be dried leaves that were crumbled up like oregano.  And it was terrible headache weed.  That's because, yeah, see, exactly.  You know what you just described?  You just described not knowing what you're doing and smoking a male plant.  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  That's exactly what it was.  Maybe you know better what this kid smoked than I, because when I was in school, this  kid that I was hanging out with thought that he was smoking weed.  And then one of his friends came to me and said, you got to go sit with him for a while  in his room because he's not doing well.  And I had to sit down with him for the night, and he said, thanks, Sam. 
[00:42:30]  I need somebody to sit with me.  I'm not doing well.  And I go, what's going on?  He's like, I don't know, man.  My shit's all fucked up.  And I was like, well, what's wrong, dude?  And he was like, it's just every time I shut my eyes, I see my grandma or one of my loved  ones, and then their face melts off to the Terminator robot.  And he was freaking out because he thought he just smoked a joint.  He probably did.  It was his first time.  No, he smoked weed every day.  Maybe it was laced.  He could have smoked something laced with dust or something. 
[00:43:00]  That's what I figured.  Dipped.  The laced weed.  Always the nightmare of the weed smoker.  Your grandma starts turning into Terminator robots.  Yeah.  But who would lace pot for no reason?  And you're not going to see the guy freaking out on it, so you don't get that thrill.  It's going to cost you money because you've got to waste it on lacing the weed.  I don't think weed was laced.  I think that's like a fucking, just a myth.  Yeah.  Or even worse, when you bought weed thinking it was laced, and then it wasn't. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, you wanted laced weed?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  What, with PCP?  Sometimes you want a little extra.  Would you finally get the energy of one real man?  Because people, you know, get strong.  Can you imagine how promiscuous Dr. Gay would be on drugs?  Oh, my God.  Oh, you probably fucked so many guys on acid.  Fucking snapping poppers in his face and just getting tooled in the asshole.  Travis, what's the most number of guys you've ever fucked while on drugs?  Oh, good question.  What's the most number? 
[00:44:00]  Even, like, back in your crazy, whatever, high school days.  Zero.  All right, whatever.  If you're not going to be honest, then let's not have the conversation.  You're a liar.  That was back when he was just PA gay.  Yeah.  When he had long hair and he cuddled with his cat.  Aw.  Yeah, that picture is really fucking gay.  Everyone loves that picture.  Everyone hates it, really.  Eric, can you post that picture on the Facebook page?  Do you have it?  Yeah, put that one back up.  That one needs to come back around. 
[00:44:30]  We need to bring the audience in.  All this talk about weed and pot and freaking out.  Remember that police, that 911 call where the police officer, it was an officer, they  had confiscated some, I think, cookies or brownies from somebody and thought it would be fun  to eat them, but then I guess they weren't prepared for the consequences and called 911 thinking  that they were dying.  Yeah, that guy was totally fucked up.  I think we're dying.  I think we're dead.  And he's a cop.  Yeah, he's a cop.  Can we play that to break if we have it?  Yeah, that's a good one, man.  That one was great. 
[00:45:00]  That guy is so fucking, he is in such a bad place.  Yeah, I have it.  It's in two parts.  Oh, good.  Oh, two parts.  Yeah, well, we might as well take a break.  It's about that time.  The food's here.  Yummy.  And we'll be back.  As I say, Jon Bernthal from Walking Dead, he's coming in about 9.35.  Spoilers.  Spoilers, people.  If you're into Walking Dead and you don't know what that last episode was about, holy fuckaroni,  are you in trouble?  Yeah.  And I can't even say watch it now. 
[00:45:30]  You're just going to be wrecked.  You're going to be wrecked.  It's going to ruin it for you.  I know Jimmy Norton downloaded the episode yesterday.  Did he watch it?  Do you know?  He was freaking out.  Well, it doesn't matter because he won't listen to this.  Very upset that he's missing this interview.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is really upset that he is not going to get a picture with Shane from Walking Dead.  He's because Jimmy's a fan of the show now.  Big fan.  Yeah.  Who knows if he'll come back.  And, of course, we don't have the big cardboard cutout of Jimmy because it cost $400. 
[00:46:00]  Well.  And nobody told Jimmy that it was $400.  Well, that's a lot of money for a one-off thing.  Well, it is, but, you know, if you have the means and...  Sex Man was all fucked up on some weed when he...  Were you fucking toasted?  Yeah.  We might have it by 9 o'clock today.  Oh!  Yeah, because Jimmy was like, I don't care.  I'll buy it.  Because it is kind of cool to have around as a prop.  We could use it for many things when Jimmy's not here.  How many pictures do you think the cardboard cutout blowing everybody is going to get? 
[00:46:30]  I think the main concern is just, like, no one wants to lay out money.  I think he's taken care of, though.  Yeah, I know, but I think that's the concern.  Yeah, Jimmy was going to do it.  Yeah, Jimmy fucking doesn't respond to emails 95% of the time.  You got to track them down for $400?  Yeah, yesterday was when we got official confirmation that Jimmy would cover it.  On Friday, being that it was that much, there was some resistance from other people as to  whether they were going to cover the expense or not. 
[00:47:00]  I'm with Eric on this one.  Really?  I don't feel like being out of pocket.  I don't have the $400 to go out of pocket.  Yeah, but if you go to Jimmy and say, like, hey, it was $400.  Yeah, and then he'll say, oh, I'll get you tomorrow.  And then tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.  Well, I'm not saying that's what would happen.  I'm just, that's what's going on in my brain.  So I don't even want to be involved.  It's like when someone loans you $100 in a casino and you disappear on them, right, Danny?  Oh, shit!  You're blowing up his spot.  I don't know, no, no, it's a hypothetical.  What happened to that break was supposed to take?  You're blowing up his spot, motherfucker. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, let's take a break and eat, and we'll be back.  Hey, one night's emergency.  Yeah, can you please send rescue to...  I think I'm having an overdose that is still with my wife.  Okay, you and your wife?  Yes.  Overnose of what?  Marijuana.  But I don't know if it had something in it.  Okay.  Can you please send rescue?  Please come.  Okay, we're on our way.  Do you guys, are you guys, like, do you guys have fever or anything?  No, I'm just, I think we're dying. 
[00:48:00]  Okay, how much did you guys have?  I don't know.  We made brownies, and I think we're dead.  I really do.  Okay, how much did you put in the brownies?  I don't know.  Was it a bag?  Who made the brownies?  I, um, my wife and I did.  Cuba, come here.  Okay, get her.  She's on the living room ground right now.  Is she breathing?  She's barely breathing.  Is she awake?  I think so.  Okay, can you look? 
[00:48:30]  Pardon?  Can you look?  Yeah, I can feel her.  She's laying right down in front of me.  Time is going by really, really, really, really slow.  Do you guys do this on a regular basis?  No, this is the first time that we've ever done it.  And you've never done marijuana before?  Yeah, I have.  You have, and you've never had this reaction to it before?  No, ever.  What's the score in the Red Wings game?  What?  What's the score in the Red Wings game?  I've got no clue.  I don't watch the Red Wings.  Oh, okay. 
[00:49:00]  I just want to make sure this isn't some type of, like, hallucination that I'm having.  Oh, why?  What does the score say?  Uh, three to three.  When channel's it on?  Uh, channel two.  Uh, it's two to two.  Huh?  It's two to two.  Okay, your police tell your officers they just passed me.  Okay, they just passed you?  Yeah.  Go outside and flag them down, okay?  Okay, my mother-in-law just got here, too.  Okay.  Okay.  Alrighty.  Alrighty. 
[00:49:30]  Bye-bye.  Bye.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  Sorry, I lost the road.  Please help me.  On Sirius XM.

Um, when I find a gun at home, did you say to look down the barrel and pull the trigger?  Sure, honey.  Give it a go.  Like this?  Whoa.  Ah, gross.  You see?  Girls are stupid.  To heck if a gun is loaded, you should always point it away from you at an immigrant or a banker.  Yay!  AmmuNation and Derek the Dodo have been proudly bringing gun safety to your community for over 30 years. 
[00:50:30]  AmmuNation, protecting your kids' rights.  AmmuNation!  It's the Anthony Show, my fucking show.  We're gonna talk about racism and guns.  Racism and guns are my fucking show.  So don't even bother trying to call in motherfuckers.  Cause Anthony don't take no fucking phone calls.  I forgot I had, uh, recited that, uh, last time. 
[00:51:00]  That, uh, Opie was out.  He's on vacation.  And Jimmy Norton, uh, he's out there on, uh, what they call the left coast.  Doing, uh, the Leno show.  I guess he's gonna be on tonight?  Sure.  Sure.  And that leaves, uh, me and, of course, uh, Danny and Sam, the occasional Travis, that, uh, that fruit.  And he rock.  And we're holding down said fort. 
[00:51:30]  Said fort.  Um, very interested in this whole Hulk Hogan sex tape thing.  Um, really?  Yeah, yeah, very interested.  Oh, you won't really see me, um, chomping at the bit for wrestling material, as does Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  Or the E-Rock.  Um, but, when something like this happens, I think it opens it up to a few more people.  They, they're going, hey, what's happening with Hulkster?  Um, and not in the wrestling world, in the bedroom. 
[00:52:00]  So, what's the official story?  He was, um, he was, uh, taped, having some sexual, uh, intercourse?  Yeah, I guess it's not with his ex-wife or current wife.  Oh!  And apparently this would have happened sometime in the interim between the two.  Between the ex and the current wife.  Yeah, and he was fucking around.  And, uh, and yeah, there's some kind of, from what I've read or what I've been told,  it looks like, uh, maybe security cam type footage. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, boy.  You know what I mean?  Oh, that's what it is?  That's what I've heard.  Somebody hid a camera in the room knowing that to get the likes of a Hulk Hogan.  A nice Hogan dick.  Doing some fucking.  Yeah.  His dick.  That's right.  Well, at least the name of the, the porno will be easy.  No one's going to have to sit in a meeting.  It'll be Hulkster in heaven.  Ah, ooh.  Is he, is he bald in it?  Does he take the thing off his head?  I wonder if he, if he, if he fucks in the bandana.  Does he rip his shirt off before he fucks the chin?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  He rips his pants off just like that.  When, uh, when she starts screaming orgasm, does he do that ear thing?  Yeah.  Like, holds, holds his hand up to his ear.  Like, let me hear her.  No, but he goes soft halfway through and then she has to start clapping.  And then his dick starts getting harder and harder and harder.  The ref comes in and picks his dick up and then it falls once.  And then drops it.  It's all limp.  And then on the third time, it fucking starts throbbing.  It starts throbbing.  His wiener starts hulking up.  Oh my God, King.  Look, his dick is up in the air.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Oh my God.  And it hurts inside.  Yeah.  Oh, it hurts inside.  Bam.  Bam.  Yeah, so this was when he was doing the Renner Center commercials?  That's right.  Troy Aitman was somewhere in the government.  Him and Troy tag teaming some bitch that walked into Renner Center to look for a television.  And I'm assuming he fucks with the weight belt on.  Oh, probably does.  I would assume.  He's got to do everything with that on.  He's got a bad back or something, right?  Yeah.  Give her that leg drop.  What's his finishing move with a bitch?  In the face?  On the tits? 
[00:54:00]  What is it?  He spray paints it.  That's still the leg drop.  It just dribbles down his leg.  It just dribbles down his leg.  And he's got to drop the leg on her tits.  He's going to deliver the leg drip.  No.  He spray paints NWO on her stomach with his jizz.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's...  Is Hulk's pubic area actually bald, but he just pencils in like little stubbly hairs?  Yeah.  Ties a bandana around his balls.  Yeah, exactly.  I, uh...  You know what? 
[00:54:30]  As far as sex tapes go, I'd give it a view.  Definitely.  You've got to watch it.  You've got to watch it.  It's not like...  It's like the, you know, the Tommy Lee thing or the Gene Simmons tape where I often say  he looks like a lion, an old lion in the pride, fucking mounting a lioness and trying to  hump her, but he's just like, bleh, bleh.  Just a horrible fucking fuck he looked like.  And Hulk Hogan...  Do you think Hulk Hogan would be a dynamo in the bedroom?  No. 
[00:55:00]  No.  I just think he's been beaten and his body is just horrifically, uh, uh, wrecked.  Mm-hmm.  That he's probably, he's probably an arthritic fuck.  He probably makes those wrestling noises too when he's fucking, like he hammers home like  a good, a good pump and he's like, ah-sha!  Ah-sha!  Uh-uh!  Uh-uh!  Uh-uh!  He stomps his foot on the ground as he's fingering it.  Definitely.  To make it sound more impressive.  Definitely.  Now, uh, what is, what is on that?  Is that actually Hulk talking about it? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I think it was...  Hulk addressed this?  I think it was, he called TMZ or something.  They do that, the damn TMZ live show.  Uh-huh.  And he called in to talk about, uh, when it was filmed and saying it was without his  knowledge and things like that.  And what is, what is, what does the warrior have to say about this?  I don't know, but I mean, the warrior...  I'd like to hear from the warrior.  At one point asserted that, uh, Hulk Hogan was definitely a gay man.  Was gay, yeah, yeah.  Um, with, and, and Hulk Hogan's wife claimed that there were  sexual relationship between him and Brutus the Barber Beefcake.  Brutus the Barber Beefcake, right, right. 
[00:56:00]  So I wonder if he is the other person in the tape.  I don't know.  Wow.  It could be.  I don't know.  Has it been confirmed that it is a woman in this sex tape?  Eric, have you heard anything?  Is it confirmed that it's a woman?  Yeah, all the reports were saying it's a mystery woman that they haven't identified yet.  Ah.  Could be, could be, and they said the race, because it could be Sweet Sapphire.  Sweet Sapphire.  Or could it be Brooke Hogan?  Yeah, theoretically.  For how, uh, how he is with his daughter, um, I don't think that's out of the question. 
[00:56:30]  Rubbing some suntan lotion on the ass cheeks.  Oh, yeah.  And a good fucking on film.  Just wanting to give his daughter a good tooling.  Yeah.  She's a big gal.  That would be an interesting one.  Would you watch, would you, would you still watch the Hulk Hogan sex tape if it was with his daughter?  Yeah, that would be even better.  Yeah.  Just watching him fuck his own daughter.  Oh, God.  That would really make it twisted.  I don't know what happens to Hulk Hogan.  If he had just kind of stayed doing some dumb shit with WWE instead of- 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Then he wouldn't have sex tapes out and trying to-  That reality show fucked him so bad.  Like, he should have just stayed-  He, he was, he got too far into the public eye with, with that one.  Because he wanted to believe that he was the star on his own.  Yeah.  And Vince McMahon wanted to believe that Hulk Hogan was a Vince McMahon creator.  So Vince is probably psyched that all this terrible press is coming out.  Yeah.  The second he put his life out there, uh, as a public fodder on, on that show. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Uh, his marriage went to shit.  Yup.  And, uh, he's got a sex tape.  He's-  He's allegedly, uh, having some type of horrid, weird contact with his daughter.  Gay sex with Brutus the Barber Beefcake.  Right.  He's, he's, uh, got a girlfriend that looks exactly like his daughter.  Yup.  The warrior says he's trading his wife around the locker room.  Warrior says-  Yup.  A warrior.  Well, let's hear, uh, Hulk's own words-  Okay.  About this sex tape.  Hulk, first of all, welcome. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, first of all, guys, there were several brunettes, okay?  Let's at least get that part.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, everybody.  Hulk was doing some fucking.  Hey, Hulk, what are you doing?  Fucking.  Yeah.  Hulk wanted some, ah, pussy.  And steroid myths about little dicks in Hogan's tights.  No.  No way.  But this is the MO for every guy that, uh, gets out of a long-termer.  Mm-hmm.  Um, long-term relationships as far as a marriage goes, or if you're living with somebody for a 
[00:58:30]  while, when you break up, you do some of that fucking-  Especially if you find out your wife is in your house with a 19-year-old who kind of looks  like you did when you were 19.  In the day.  Yeah.  Then you gotta go out and do some fucking.  So he's just saying, uh, this, uh, he was doing some fucking.  He got that Hogan dick wet.  And when you do fucking like that, uh, someone might pop a camera in the room. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, sure.  All right.  2012, for God's sake.  Let's hear, uh, the rest of a Hulk hoaxer.  All right.  No, there was, between, between the divorce from Linda and the time I met Jennifer, I  had about four and a half months that I really went crazy.  And I actually wrote about it in my book about staying drunk and crazy and hitting all the  bars.  So I was, uh, really out of my mind for a while.  We are all hitting the bars.  How great would it be to go into a bar and see a drunk Hulk Hogan hitting on young chicks? 
[00:59:30]  Oh man, right?  With his handlebar mustache and his do-rag on.  His do-rag still on.  Remember WrestleMania 3?  You remember that?  That was me.  And the girl's like, no, we weren't alive.  Yeah, what?  Aren't you the Undertaker?  No, I'm Hulk.  Do you know Hornswoggle?  Come over to my place and watch my free Rent-A-Center television that they gave me.  Yeah.  Because my wife took everything.  I gotta give it back when I stop doing commercials.  It's Rent-A-Center.  But for now, it's a good picture. 
[01:00:00]  We can watch my old videotapes.  Of WrestleMania.  Dean Fitzgerald really isn't that bad, brother.  You can watch me bleach my mustache.  We're joined in the phone with David Houston, who is your lawyer in this whole thing.  So, David, welcome as well.  Thank you, Harvey.  So, walk us through this.  So, when, what year was this tape shot?  Well, brother, I don't know what year it was.  Brother.  Brother.  But this year, around September, end of September, October, I will have been with Jennifer for five years. 
[01:00:30]  All right, hold the phone.  He doesn't know what year it was.  No.  But he's been with Jennifer for five years.  Right.  So, he obviously doesn't want to say it was within five years.  Yeah.  But I'm guaranteeing it was within five years.  Probably about, you know, three years ago.  Six years ago, brother.  Five year, one month, brother.  That's what I'm guessing.  Five years, one month.  It was actually two days before I met Jennifer. 
[01:01:00]  There's a way to tell.  And believe me, if you were videotaped having some sex, even if you've had sex with a lot of chicks, you would probably know the room, some type of thing of what happened.  And even if you haven't seen the tape, you kind of know which chick would have been the one to leak a sex tape.  Yeah.  And you got like, oh, I remember that being in the room.  Yeah.  Or just something that would strike a nerve and be like, oh, I remember when this was.  He's going to get in trouble with fucking with Jennifer, brother. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  How much fucking could he have possibly done in four months that he doesn't remember?  I understand it is the Hulkster.  So, he's getting some quim.  Listen.  Night after night.  I saw him in that Rick Derringer video.  Oh, come on.  He's a stud.  The guy's a stud.  He could pull out the guitar and do fucking his song.  It's Thunder Lips, for God's sake.  Thunder Lips.  He could play fucking Rocky.  Yeah.  There's plenty of fuel he has to get that pussy revving for some Hulk.  Hulkster cock.  You know it. 
[01:02:00]  That long?  So, the question I'm wondering is, you know, why would someone hold on to this for at least  five years, you know, and then do this to me now?  That's what I don't understand.  He's selling that five-year thing.  He is so guilty.  He's selling that five-year.  Why would someone hold it for five years, brother?  Because it was five years, brother.  Brother, at least.  At least five years, brother.  Could have been more than that, but not more than eight, because I wouldn't ever cheat  on anyone, brother.  That's right, brother. 
[01:02:30]  Fucking TV's showing, like, the fucking Lost finale in the background.  Wait a minute, brother.  I got an advance copy, brother.  Don't worry.  Last week's Walking Dead is on.  There's a spoiler in there, brother.  Brother.  Right, brother?  Dan, and I did not know it was being done.  You know, I didn't say, hey, brunette, let's put a camera up and have a sex tape.  I mean, I'm dumb, but I'm not dumb and dumber.  And so I just don't know why someone would do this, number one. 
[01:03:00]  And number two, why they would wait five years to release it.  All right.  Look, I would think if anybody is going to have sex with Hulk Hogan, they would film it.  If, hypothetically, I was having sex with Hulk Hogan.  Oh, geez.  Hypothetically.  Wow.  I would make sure it was on video.  You're putting yourself out there.  I'm just saying, it's a hypothetical.  You wouldn't film it if you were having sex with Hulk Hogan?  I wouldn't have sex with Hulk Hogan.  Hypothetically.  Not even hypothetically.  There's no instance where I can even imagine having any type of sex with the Hulkster. 
[01:03:30]  What if he was like, Eric, if Hulk Hogan was like, you can come, you can hang out at my house,  you can watch wrestling tapes with me, I'll give you a pair of my old boots.  Oh, wow.  I'm there.  Right, you would have sex with the Hulkster.  You guys are so gay for Hulk, man.  You're so gay for Hulk.  It's crazy.  If you did, if he found the magic formula that you and the Hulkster had sex, hypothetically,  would you film it?  No, I can't break down that wall of heroes to have sex. 
[01:04:00]  If you were going to have sex with him anyway, would you film it or not film it?  Oh, I'd film it.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay.  See, only you guys can fucking work that out in your own head.  That's what I'm saying.  Even hypothetically say that you're having sex with the Hulkster.  I like how Hulk is asking why someone would tape him in the first place.  Well, because you're famous.  Yeah.  And people, you know, do video famous people having sex without their knowledge.  Did you hear him mention again?  And hold it for five years.  And why would they hold it for five years, brother? 
[01:04:30]  Wait, I sound like Jesse.  Why is it sounding like Jesse?  Why would they hold it for five years?  There's the conspiracy.  I know McMahon's involved.  Brother.  Brother.  Yeah.  Five years.  Nah, it's cool.  Just play it.  Let's hear us say more five years.  Bullshit.  At least five years.  Hey, Hulk and David, this is Mike Walters.  I've actually seen part of this tape, but it only shows a brunette. 
[01:05:00]  It shows him.  It's a bedroom.  It appears to be security footage from inside of a home.  And it shows Hulk kind of going towards a brunette woman.  And then that's all that I've seen.  Does that ring any kind of a bell with you, Hulk?  You know, Harvey, I'm not trying to be a smart aleck.  I'm horrible with remembering names, you know.  Names.  But that's why I call everybody brother.  But during that time.  Is that why?  I don't know.  I thought it was a thing, but it's because he can't remember names. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, I'd like to introduce you to brother.  Brother.  This is brother, brother.  I don't think that's true at all.  I mean, every wrestler says brother.  And believe me, he fucking knows exactly who's on this tape.  Of course he does.  Stop.  Maybe the second he watched it, he didn't know.  But he didn't just go, oh, I don't know who that is.  Let's just put the tape away.  Oh, yeah, that's that chick, uh, uh, brother.  Brother.  That's brother.  You know, he, he, he, he toiled to figure out who the fuck that was. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Because how are you going to prevent it from being released?  How are you going to file your lawsuit and your injunctions and everything?  He's got to know who it was.  He's got a lawyer on the phone.  Right.  I think her name was brother, if I remember right.  Yeah.  I don't know who it was.  I mean, you think when he's in his lawyer's office and the lawyer goes, who was this?  I don't know, brother.  Who's my brother?  Brother Steen.  Brother Berg.  It's my lawyer.  See, he's Jewish.  He doesn't know who the woman is on the tape.  Stop it, Hulk.  Stop it. 
[01:06:30]  You know, but that's why I call everybody brother.  But during that time, that, that four or five month window where I was going crazy,  I was, when I first thing I did was I, when I sat down with Jennifer, I said, I don't even remember people's names.  You know, last weekend that I met, I meet so many people, much less girls, five or six or seven years ago, or five years ago, whatever it was.  It's just, I couldn't remember a name if I had to.  And the truth is, it wasn't just one brunette.  I was running pretty wild there for a few minutes.  Hulkamania was running wild. 
[01:07:00]  Hulkamania was indeed running wild.  But he's saying, like, because he meets so many people, he doesn't remember names.  So he's comparing a dopey wrestling fan coming up to him and saying, nice to meet you, to a girl that he had intercourse with.  And videotaped it.  And videotaped it and called her brother.  Yeah, and he's comparing it to the same guy that's like, it's still real to me.  Yeah.  Like that guy or the brunette that he's fucking.  Oh, Hulk.  This has, you fucked around on Jennifer written all over it. 
[01:07:30]  You definitely think you cheated on this chick.  In my opinion, of course, I don't know.  But based on the evidence I'm hearing here, I would say that this happened sooner than five years ago.  If you were the Hulkster and you had ring rats around you all the time, which, I mean, you'd have to, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's in that situation.  He's the Hulkster, for God's sake.  Yeah, he's got to prove it.  And, uh, I'm just amazed that women are still fucking the Hulk.  Like, just, I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  Maybe the Hulk from, you know, the early days.  WrestleMania won.  WrestleMania, okay.  So before he was completely horseshoe bald when he had a bit of a comb over happening.  Yeah, the little comb over thing happening.  But his hair was so thin and blonde anyway that it wasn't like he just had this thick, curly baldness happening.  Wow, what a goofy-looking motherfucker.  Really?  Where is that from?  I guess his high school.  Yeah, that's his high school yearbook.  His high school picture? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, that's pretty fucking bad.  So you're talking that guy right there.  Yeah, yeah.  When he's got a little, a few wisps on the top of his head still.  Some wisps.  Yeah.  The body's still there.  It doesn't look like the old man in shape body.  Where the side of, I don't know, the side of his arms look like Stretch Armstrong.  It kind of wrinkles up on him now.  It just looks really odd.  All that gel starts congealing.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  So it's hard.  I can't really believe he's knocking down so many women that he doesn't remember this brunette who is visible on the videotape also. 
[01:09:00]  Although maybe, I mean, there's a certain amount of vagina that just fame will get you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like he's famous enough that there'll always be somebody who won't have sex with him.  Someone is always going to want to fuck Hulk Hogan.  Yes.  I don't know.  You would, you said.  Just fucking Hulk Hogan.  I bet he gets decent fucking tangs.  You have to, man.  Fucking Hulk Hogan?  I gotta go with the fame thing.  You're right. 
[01:09:30]  But he'd remember.  He hangs out in Florida.  You don't think all those white trash Florida chicks would be like, yeah, I met Hulk Hogan today.  I fucked him.  I fucked Hulk Hogan.  So did I.  So you were with Hulk Hogan then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's up in Fargo.  Yeah, he could get some tail in Fargo.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Kind of funny looking.  Yeah.  He had a handlebar mustache.  Just generally funny looking.  Well, he was kind of bald.  Handlebar mustache.  Yeah, well, I wonder when it comes out for public consumption. 
[01:10:00]  Any rumor?  Anything on the rumor mill as to when this is going to actually come out?  I haven't heard anything.  Have you heard anything, Eric?  No, nothing about it.  I know they were.  Eric, when are you going to release the tape?  I did.  No, it's you.  He is a brunette.  Oh, man.  They were shopping it around, but now lawyers are involved, so it's on hold.  Shopping it.  Look at his belly.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm bored.  Talk to me. 
[01:10:30]  Hulk's belly button isn't even a belly button.  It is a complete mouth, and he can barely move anymore.  He can't leg drop.  He can't big boot.  He hobbles around.  His back is fucking.  That's just fucking got to be awful.  How old is the guy, though?  He's like, what, 62 or something?  He's got to be old, man.  I mean, most 62-year-olds are mobile, at least.  Sure, but he's been beating up.  He's been punishing his body for the better part of 40 years.  Yeah, he's been punishing brunette's bodies, too.  The Hulkster, baby.  Aw, yeah.  You know something, brother?  You're about to get fucked is what you should know. 
[01:11:00]  Aw, yeah.  That's, uh, I don't know.  The sex tape thing, um, I've been tempted a few times to film it.  I've thought about putting a camera somewhere.  You got so many cameras in the house.  Oh, I know, but.  How great would it be if this fucking Hulk Hogan sex tape comes out and he's a fucking animal?  Like, he's stuffing his balls into this bitch's mouth.  Oh, yeah.  He's doing a booyah in her ass.  He's, like, he's getting all athletic with his sexual positions. 
[01:11:30]  He's doing the fucking POV.  Fucking her up against the wall.  Yeah.  POV blowjobs where he's smacking her face.  Ha, ha, ha.  Great.  Hulk's just a maniac.  That's the one thing that's always so disappointing when all these sex tapes.  But they're, it's always boring.  You always think that, oh, someone else is having so much better sex than me.  And you know what?  They're not.  Nah.  They aren't.  They're just doing the basics.  They're doing the same shit.  And the Hulk's just got to just be a beaten man as far as, uh, fucking goes. 
[01:12:00]  You think he's doing, like, you think he's California long stroking it?  I don't think so.  No, he's just.  I think he's, like.  He's Gene Simmons-ing all the way.  Short little fucking thrust.  He could barely move.  Yeah, yeah.  What's he doing in bed, really?  He's just pumping for about three minutes and then he's finished.  I've thought about it, but, uh, never, never actually did it.  You could do, um, a full-scale porno movie in your house.  I could go and shoot, yeah.  I could put virtual backgrounds in, uh, you could have a story like fucking Boogie Nights.  You have better equipment in your house than most porno studios do. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, uh.  Why don't you make a porno movie?  I'm proud of that.  I should.  Yeah.  If it wasn't illegal in New York State, I believe.  I think it is.  Or maybe New York City.  Just don't pay anyone.  I don't know.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Why would I?  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Just, yeah, have sex with me.  I'm doing a movie.  Or you could get Big A to come over and make a Big A porno.  Nah.  I don't think, uh, anybody really wants to see that one.  No?  Nah, not at all.  You know what I never understood in pornos?  Um, how they find those women so attractive. 
[01:13:00]  Uh, uh, when they're fucking in, like, a house and it's, like, obviously a rented house  or one of the producers' house.  Yeah.  And sometimes there will be covering to protect from fluids and such.  Oh, really?  But there is the time where you see a big, just, shot of cum, just, it's totally hitting  someone.  Someone owns that couch.  Uh.  That's someone's couch.  Now, what happens?  Rent-a-center, brother.  That's it.  Exactly.  Is that a rent-a-center cum couch?  Oh.  Or does now, does now someone have to clean the cum up off the couch because someone's going  to watch TV later?  I think they have a set dresser that comes in and brings in different furniture than the actual 
[01:13:30]  house.  I mean, look, I know that.  I think it's a studio couch.  Is it?  I believe so.  Yeah, you couldn't.  If you're renting your house out for porno, which they do in L.A. a lot.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  But, I mean, I'm sure they want to keep costs down as much as possible, so why have the  extra overhead?  Because the guy that's renting the house doesn't want cum all over his fucking couches.  Maybe he's just like, ah, we'll just wipe it down.  Yeah, I get the, I don't know.  I don't know.  I want to know the answer.  Yeah, maybe there's...  Give us a call.  866-WOW-WOW-WOW if you can help me out answering some cum questions. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, if you know what the guy is actually jizzing on, is it a rented couch?  Is it the homeowner's couch?  Does someone have to clean that couch?  I believe you should make a porno movie and just keep it for yourself.  Yeah?  But then, like, anytime you have a girl over or whatever, be like, yo, I made a porno  movie.  I make porno.  Check it out.  That's what I do.  Check it out.  Yeah.  Check it out.  Or if a girl's like, hey, you want to put a porno in?  You'll be like, yeah, and you just put it in yours.  Hey, that looks familiar.  That place, I recognize that couch.  Yeah, you're on it.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Around that couch.  You like that, don't you?  Yeah.  If I was you, I would have built a fucking, I would have built secret cameras, like, all  over the place already.  Yeah, I know.  I really should have.  They're so easy to put in now.  Yeah.  I can tell you the truth.  They're really remote.  No wires.  You just directly to your fucking router and shit.  So there's a way, there's a way to do it.  I don't think I want to.  It's kind of, it's really an invasion.  You recognize that couch.  You're about to recognize that dick.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  No, I, I, I've never done that.  I, I've said in the past, I have had sex while the camera was on and plugged into a television  so that you get that as it's happening view.  But no VHS tape in the VCR.  But nothing full circle section.  Yeah, yeah.  No tape rolling because I never trust that something might happen.  I'll tell you something.  You never know.  I made a tape with a girlfriend back when I was like probably 17 or whatever. 
[01:15:30]  And so it wouldn't get lost.  I remember writing on it in like nail polish, porno.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Just so that like there's never going to be a question.  You know what?  What this fucking tape is.  And ask me if I know where it is.  I have no fucking clue.  Oh, I gotta find it.  Is that gone?  That's on the internet somewhere.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was a good one.  I know there's some, I know there's some photographs.  Really?  I know there's photo, like hard fucking copy, hard, copy photos.  Of you?  Of maybe some sexploits that went on years ago. 
[01:16:00]  Well over five years ago, brother.  Yeah, you're probably not all in the frame though.  I don't know.  I think it was pretty in the frame at that point.  Yeah, yeah, that might have.  And then I know there's also, I did some little skits when VCR cameras fucking, you know, camcorders first came out.  Oh, I know.  You know the direction it's going.  And I was just, you know, hey, let me put some shit together with my friends. 
[01:16:30]  It's going to be fun.  And there is some horrifically racist stuff on there.  No, no sex.  I thought we were heading towards like circle jerk territory.  No!  Me and my friends and this camera.  No, it's just, I'm playing a character.  Playing a character.  What's the character's name?  Behind a desk.  It's Anthony Cooney.  It's a bubble spring, Steve.  But it's horrifically racist.  Where's the tape?  I don't know.  We got a tape.  It went out somewhere. 
[01:17:00]  I think I have it on CD.  It's called Live at the Apollo.  Live at the Apollo, yeah.  Yeah, that's when you're on the cover in blackface.  Is that or is it something else that's incredibly racist?  In blackface in front of the Apollo 11 rocket instead of the Apollo Theater.  As easy as that is to find.  Yeah.  It's amazing that that's never ended up on a Fox News channel or something.  I know.  And all the shit we've done in the past.  That should be your file photo.  That really should be.  And here is a photo.  We warn you, this image will be disturbing.  But you know what?  You got a big afro in the picture. 
[01:17:30]  You're wearing blackface.  You're like, it's not me.  Yeah.  It's not me.  How great would it have been for like the homeless Charlie situation if that's the graphic  And here, when they say it was an isolated incident, shock jock Anthony Cumia, a history  of racism.  And yeah, well, that was just a play on words.  See, because it was live at the Apollo, which is, you know, a big thing to do if you're musicians.  And we had Rotgut, the band.  We would never play at the Apollo, the real Apollo. 
[01:18:00]  So it was us in blackface superimposed in front of the Apollo.  The principal, you could have played, but you just were like, no, I'd never play there.  Superimposed in front of the Apollo rocket, taking off.  I think the most offensive part of that is we never paid the royalties to use that file  photo.  I could think of something more offensive.  Oh, really?  The five guys in blackface?  There you go.  That was what was on my mind.  I wish there was a bigger picture.  Unless you, what is that saying?  If you forget history, you're damned to repeat it. 
[01:18:30]  That's right.  See, I am reminding people that there were minstrel shows where white people did dress  in blackface.  Horrible.  And it was terrible.  So all I'm doing is keeping that image alive so people can say, never again, never again.  Oh, thank God.  Yeah, yeah.  See, I'm helping.  It looks helpful in that picture.  That is dick.  Oh, brother.  What about those big red lips?  The big red lips and the very wide eyes.  We told everybody, hey, make the big wide eyes.  Hide, hide, hide, hide. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, no.  What is this fucking white album cover bullshit that you're trying to pull where everybody's  got their black top hats except you?  I know, right?  I don't know what that was all about, to be honest with you.  Whatever fucking Paul is dead.  Yeah.  No, I had the...  Are you a fucking walrus, too?  No, I was just the lead singer.  So I had to be special with the white lips.  You had to have a gimmick.  I had the big white lips instead of the red ones, and I had the white top hat.  You know what?  Even talking about this is probably damaging to you even now. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  Well, I think we should be able to talk about our past and what we did.  Do you regret this?  No, this was not done with any animosity.  This wasn't done to offend anybody.  It's a shocking cover.  Sure.  It was a different time, too.  I mean...  Oh, it was a different time back then, in 1992, I believe it was.  92?  92.  It was a different time.  Yeah, it's 20 fucking years.  Wow.  What the fuck, man?  What have you done? 
[01:20:00]  What have I done?  What have I done with my life?  Oh, that's right.  Actually, I guess I did okay.  I did well in the last 20 years.  We were talking about hoarding at the top of the show.  I was going through some stuff.  I found comic books from the early 90s.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And then they hit me, and I was like, these comics are 20 years old.  20 years old.  You know when the time thing hits me like that?  When I'm sitting there, and I'm figuring out who won the Royal Rumble 20 years ago.  Of course.  It goes back to wrestling.  And then I remember when I was a kid, who won the Royal Rumble five years ago was like 
[01:20:30]  a distant memory.  Sam keeps saying, when I was a kid.  I know.  I know.  He'll understand years from now that, oh, shit, I was still a kid.  What happened?  What happened?  And then, you know, 20 years later, you're always thinking, well, I will be married in  a couple of months.  You will be married in a couple of months, and you will still watch wrestling, and you  will still have an Ice Age 3 sandwich holder.  You read comic books and wear zombie t-shirts.  Ice Age 3 sandwich holder.  Zombie t-shirts and comic books. 
[01:21:00]  I'm not getting married.  Yeah.  Now, that's got to throw a monkey wrench into the relationship and the marriage, that you  are so into childish things, and you're supposed to be an adult getting married to a lovely  woman.  I watch wrestling.  He reads comic books.  You play with guns.  I don't understand.  Well, let me tell you.  I think playing with guns and playing is not the word.  It's, you know.  There's not.  Look.  Shooting guns. 
[01:21:30]  If you set up shots for a new Instagram avatar, you're playing with guns.  Yeah.  Yes.  The only difference is, if you're portaging a fucking sniper rifle at a caged raccoon, you're  playing with guns.  All right.  You're allowed to buy real guns instead of toy guns.  That's the difference.  If you're spying on your neighbors with a fucking high-powered optics, an optic, you're  playing with guns.  All right.  We could probably come up with a whole bullet point.  I got to agree, then.  There has been some playing. 
[01:22:00]  I mean, look.  There has to be good cop, bad cop here, or else it's not interesting for anyone.  There has been some playing with guns, but I think that that's a little better than wrestling  and that you're trying to lump us all in one category when you play with a lot of childish  things when you're, and you're getting married.  I am getting married in a couple of months.  Yeah.  A couple of months it is now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What month, actually?  June.  June.  A June wedding?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Are you done with all the shopping stuff you got to do for weddings?  What does that entail?  Big pain in the ass?  You and the girl get in any fights?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you have?  Lots of fights, yeah.  About?  Perfect.  Just what you should be doing not before you get married.  Great precursor to the fucking marriage.  I don't know any...  See how fucking dumb this is?  It is dumb.  It's dumb.  It should be all love.  I don't know any...  You're like Braveheart.  Just go out in the woods and marry your girl because you love her.  I haven't actually met...  And have her throat slitted by some fucking guy.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[01:23:00]  I haven't met any couple that hasn't had fights during planning the wedding.  Which is stupid!  Every, every...  And I think also at some point while planning every wedding, the...  Why wouldn't we have just eloped?  Conversation comes up several times.  And there's no way to ever just have a small thing.  It's like, you know what?  We just have a couple of relatives that we really care about and maybe close friends.  And then it just turns into a huge guest list.  But it'll be a very special day when it arrives.  Oh, is that worth all the...  Worth all the...  Misery?  Mm-hmm.  There shouldn't be misery.  There shouldn't be arguments.  This moment that is supposed to be based in love and mutual respect and understanding, 
[01:23:30]  how come it's got to start with arguments?  Because you have not only two people, but you have two people's families.  And all those wrestlers.  And all the wrestlers.  That's true.  But you have everybody planning a wedding.  Everybody wants to get involved.  And then everybody...  You know what I mean?  But now you're...  Everybody has feelings.  But now you know the fight. 
[01:24:00]  And you know what fighting is going to be like between you two.  And it kind of makes it...  Kind of ruins the whole thing.  No, because I can handle it.  Because, you know what?  Here's...  And this will...  This will...  My mouth.  This will shut your mouth.  This will...  And it will, you know, bring down all your worries.  Oh.  We just got into a fight on Sunday.  Uh-oh.  Wrestling?  No.  It wasn't wrestling related.  It was about wrestling.  It was planning the wedding.  And she said, you're not helping.  And I said, so-and-so.  And blah, blah, blah.  Because you're not. 
[01:24:30]  I'm not helping much.  Yeah.  Um, but we got into this big fight.  And then 20 minutes later, she said, hey, um, I think I picked that fight out of nowhere.  I don't know why I did it.  And I'm sorry.  And then you know what I said?  Whoa!  You know what I said?  Fuck you, bitch!  I said, well, I snapped at you.  And that wasn't necessary.  So I'm sorry.  And then everything was okay.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  How does that work?  That's right.  It's too...  It does work.  It's too mature people. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I'm trying this now.  It's there about each other.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a whole new world.  Yeah.  Instead of just fuck you under your breath saying the C word.  Because you know why?  I actually like Jess.  Oh!  Yeah.  I like Jess and, uh...  I do too.  Oh, man.  Who doesn't?  I'm sure she's very popular.  Oh, popular gal.  The reason I like her, probably other people find those qualities...  Do you want to know the reasons that I like her?  Why?  I didn't think you were to know.  Yeah, right?  Wait a minute.  What the fuck are you open that up for?  Are you fucking cuckled?  You lunatic.  But Jess is completely... 
[01:25:30]  Because I haven't...  It's not like I've hidden any of my habits or hobbies from her.  Yeah.  So it's not like this is going to shock her once we get married.  Uh-huh.  I'm this guy who doesn't want to go eat at an Indian restaurant with her ever in my life at all.  One thing I've noticed about Sam...  Uh-huh.  Now, I don't have much out of studio contact with young Sam, but I have noticed Sam doesn't really crow much about the girls.  You know?  He's not one to kiss and tell so much. 
[01:26:00]  Well, yeah, he's not like a hot girl is out in the hallway or on the internets, and you're like, wow, that fucking...  Look at them tits or that...  You know, you're kind of...  I think Jess is pretty safe with you.  Dr. Gay!  Or you're gay.  Right, right.  I'm heterosexual.  I think Jess is safe.  I don't think so.  I don't think you're the cheating type.  I don't think so either.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I prefer emotional and mental stimulation.  Oh. 
[01:26:30]  Did you ever cheat on a girl?  No.  Never?  Never.  Not even those black chicks?  Not even those black chicks?  So you don't even know how good it feels to cheat on someone?  Oh, man.  Getting away with it?  Because...  But I've also been in situations where I know that within one movement, this could turn from just flirting and two people being friends to cheating.  Oh, until docking?  To docking, yeah.  Until docking.  Yeah, but you know what, guys?  Someone, I'm sure somebody would argue that mentally you've already cheated.  I've had that conversation. 
[01:27:00]  And I've, you know...  Oh, God.  What?  Yeah, well, emotionally...  Mental cheating?  It doesn't take a penis to cheat, you know.  That's true.  Holy fucking...  Holy...  Holy...  90s, 2000s bullshit.  I've been accused of mental cheating before.  Mental cheating.  With who?  Who are you cheating with?  Who are you...  Or is that not subject for air?  Yeah, I mean, I don't think you know that many times.  But you mentally cheated with another woman.  Yes.  And this got back to Jess?  Yeah, I mean, Jess is observant. 
[01:27:30]  Like, she knows that, like...  Was it Cream Pie Jones?  It was Jared the Fishboy, yes.  Cream Pie Jones.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  She realized...  Cream Pie Jones.  All I was doing.  You guys spent a lot of time in, I mean, my free cream pies.  I'm sitting there at dinner, and I'm like, Jess, me and Jared had the greatest time, and da-da-da.  And she's like, you're not even paying attention to me anymore.  Oh, man.  No, but she...  How did you emotionally, mentally cheat?  Because she noticed my attitude towards her was, like, a little colder than usual.  Mm-hmm.  And...  Colder than usual? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I'm not a cold guy around her.  Okay.  You're a warm guy?  Yeah.  I mean, the sound was a little questionable.  You know, but...  And that, you know, I was not paying attention to her.  And she knew who I talked to, and who I was texting with, and who I was...  Oh, shit.  So she thought that you were not liking her as much because you were starting to go with this other one.  Because I was talking to this other chick so much.  Why were you talking to another chick?  You're texting and shit?  Yeah.  I mean, that was... 
[01:28:30]  So she got mad at that?  That's what...  Yeah, and I had to...  I was like, but we're just texting.  And she was like...  And what did you do?  You ended that text relationship.  Yeah.  You're pussy whipped.  No, because I realized...  Because she was like, well, if I was doing it to you...  Does she?  How would you feel?  I'd be, like, I'd be pretty pissed.  Does she text guys?  Not like this.  What do you mean, not like this?  Does she text any guys?  She has texted a guy in her life.  Does she?  Now?  She doesn't have any guy friends that are like, oh, this is just my guy friend, da-da-da.  Really?  No.  Does she play that fucking words with friends with guys? 
[01:29:00]  No.  I think that's a fucking whole gimmick to it.  Words with friends?  I think the words, they're like, fuck my pussy.  It's like, what the fuck is there?  They're texting each other.  I've heard stories of hookups happening over...  Why don't I just say, like, Bob Kelly?  I heard hookups of people getting together from, like, poker websites.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  So believe me, I'm sure words with friends have led to more than one encounter.  Yeah.  Easily.  Easily.  I've caught shit for, like, following people on Twitter and things like that. 
[01:29:30]  And then there's the double standard where, you know, if the girl is following somebody,  it's totally innocent.  The guy is gay.  It's this.  It's a friend.  It's that.  But then the second you go following somebody and then they trod through your fucking shit,  they're like, what is this?  What is this?  Okay, Columbo.  Right.  Leave the fuck alone.  There's no double standards.  Like, if I'm, like, crossing the line a little bit, I'll be like, okay, you're probably right.  Let me...  Boy, you are going to have it rough when you're married. 
[01:30:00]  But if I catch her doing anything that she would ever accuse me of doing...  You throw her a beating.  I sound like Donkey Kong.  Thank God he knows to give her the back of the hand.  Yeah.  Punch her right in her jaw.  Oh, shit.  It's going to be tough to talk to any guys that way, isn't it, Jess?  Lie.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  And then you bust her thumbs so she can't text.  That's right.  Yeah.  Take the hammer out.  That's how we roll, bitches.  It's going to be tough reading all those texts when your eyes are puffed shut.  Yeah, that's another thing.  You've got to close her eyes.  Exactly.  Make her a fucking deaf mute.  Exactly. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  You, uh...  No, you're a pussy when it comes to that.  You would...  Have you...  Has she ever checked your phone?  Has she ever picked your phone up and thumbed through?  During that time period, she did once.  And what did she find that she was upset with?  Was she...  Too many text messages.  Too many texts.  It wasn't sexual text messages.  It was just too much.  Emotional, though.  Emotional.  You were making a...  You were bonding a little more with this person than she would have liked.  But...  So then you picked up her phone.  And went through it.  No, no, no, no.  Well, I don't know.  Now, why didn't you? 
[01:31:00]  Well, because...  There wasn't...  She wasn't talking to anybody.  These...  Oh, yeah.  Fucking...  You fucking girls, by the way...  Are full of shit.  Yeah, because I'll tell you what it is.  Every...  Guys out there, whatever the fuck it is that you're thinking about, whatever it is that you're  doing, she's doing it too.  Yes.  That's it.  Period.  There's no big...  There's no Mars-Venus bullshit when it comes down to getting your fucking...  Your dick wet or your pussy filled.  Right.  Everyone is the same.  If I'm in a relationship and I'm talking to some girl online, I'm like, bro, I shouldn't  be doing this.  She's doing it too.  Yeah.  Thinking the same thing, probably.  Hopefully. 
[01:31:30]  And let me tell you something.  It doesn't even have to culminate in fucking.  But if you're doing this flirtatious texting, why does the guy catch shit for it?  And the girl could just talk to how many of her guy friends because, oh, it's nothing,  it's platonic, it's this.  Bullshit.  Let me tell you the fucking story.  You have to not allow it to happen.  You have to be, okay, okay, I won't do the flirty thing, but I'm not going to catch you  doing that either.  But you should have been able to look through her phone.  You should have been able to look through her phone.  I mean, I'm sure I could have, but I can't tell her this is wrong. 
[01:32:00]  Do not look through my phone ever again and then be like, okay, now I'm going to look  through your phone.  Did you tell her this is wrong?  Don't look through my phone again?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And has she?  No, no, no.  And can she?  Do you have a little block code on there?  No, because...  Oh, boy.  You know, I trust her.  You better start zipping up some loose fucking ends before you get married, my friend.  But I don't have loose ends.  That's a loose end right there.  I trust her.  You don't have a digit code in there that you can just press that button and your phone  is open to the world?  I don't have text to hide from her anymore. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And, uh...  But not like Jimmy was saying yesterday, when someone picks your phone up and starts thumbing  through your photos, they're going to get a surprise?  No.  They don't got no Sammy cock pics on them?  No Sammy dick pic?  Nope.  No?  I'm careful like that.  Any nudies of the girl?  Tight pubes you got, probably?  Stop fantasizing.  No nudies of the girl?  No.  I cover my bases, and so does she.  We're very safe, rational human beings.  How do you know she doesn't have pictures?  How do you know she doesn't have those mirror shots? 
[01:33:00]  Those mirror shots in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  Making that duck face.  I love a good mirror shot, though.  A good one.  Not the duck face.  Not the peace sign duck face.  I know her very well.  Fucking girls.  I've been with her for seven years.  Yeah, you know what?  You fucking think you do?  Great.  Yeah.  Great.  That amounts to.  You know how long I knew fucking I was with one of my exes for?  Longer than that, buddy.  Were you living together?  Yeah, well, at times.  You probably spent too much time apart.  No, we actually spent too much time together, I think.  Honestly, it was.  What happened?  With that?  Yeah.  It was just, it's too much time to know someone. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  You know, like relationships, you know, they're not.  But I don't, I don't, they, there is a shelf life.  There's a shelf life.  And, and I don't really think that it's natural for two people to enjoy each other for fucking  50 years at a time.  There is a shelf life.  And it all depends like food.  If you refrigerate it, it'll last longer.  And refrigeration of a relationship, it tells things like a little romance, a little passion.  Those things equal refrigeration.  Yeah, and put that shit in the freezer.  If you don't have those things, they're going to go bad. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, the freezer is like, you do things together, you're fucking passionate.  And then don't do shit for a while.  No, no, I'm saying, no.  Your relationship will rot.  I'm agreeing with you by saying, put the shit away.  Like, like, we don't have to all be lovey-dovey every fucking five minutes and shit.  Like, I don't have to sit on the couch with you for the rest of my life.  Okay?  Not until you're married.  We can be, we can be separate.  We can have separate entities.  We don't have to talk to each other non-fucking-stop.  And then the times that we, we are interacting, that's great.  Yeah, yeah.  But it doesn't have to fucking be non-stop.  I was just kind of having this. 
[01:34:30]  So it's all fresh in my mind.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Because, like, you know, I understand that, you know, there are attention needs that are,  that everyone has.  Okay?  But there's also other commitments, too.  Like, you know, if you're a working guy, you get home, you spend all day out, you commute,  you use an hour in, an hour back, you had your whole day, you're fucking tired, right?  You got your shit you want to do on the computer, your TV, you want to play with your balls.  I don't have time to fucking sit there and, hey, let's all, let's play a fucking board game.  Like, dude, I'm sorry.  Board game?  Well, whatever it is, it's just like, I don't, like, I'm sorry, like, one or two of those 
[01:35:00]  days, like, we'll do something fun, or the weekends, obviously, there's more time, but  I can't, I just fucking can't sit there.  Yeah.  Monday, after Tuesday, after when, and do all these activities.  Like, I'm sorry, some days I'm going to come home, I ain't going to say a fucking word  to you, and I'm going to be on my computer for the next four hours, and I hope you like  it.  But you, but you're in the wrong there, and, and she, though, can do whatever she wants  when you sit on the couch and watch TV, because you're not going, why don't you come and sit  by me, why don't you do, you're letting her do what she does, and that's her time to do  something, and then when you go to do something, oh, well, you're going to go down and do that, 
[01:35:30]  oh, you're doing this.  Well, you know what I got last night?  Fuck.  I got, I got, uh, uh, AIDS.  I wish.  Would have implied I had some sex now.  I got, uh, oh, you done?  Not, but not, not, that was even too cunty.  I even said that too cunty.  Yeah, that's pretty snappy.  It was, uh, it was like, are you done?  But I, I'm not getting it outright, because even that sounds too cunty, but I knew what  it was.  But there shouldn't even be a question of what I'm talking about.  It was, oh, you've been ignoring me on the computer since you got home, so are you done 
[01:36:00]  now?  Can we fucking, and it was one of those things.  And, like, fucking Cesar Millan, I just fucking poked that bitch in the neck, and I was  just like, listen, like, you have to understand, you know, here, here's my head, and I just,  and there, you know, and that's what I'm saying about how being, you know, how Sam is with  his chick.  I was just kind of on the table, and you talk it out.  Yeah.  And it's so much better than screaming your face off or holding it in.  Does she work, your chick?  No.  So that's a lot of it.  Yeah.  Because, like, Jess and me are compatible, because she comes home from work after I'm home, and, 
[01:36:30]  like, oh, we just chill.  Well, I mean, that's part of it, because she's losing her mind, I suppose, you know,  just being indoors, you know, all pent up, and, you know, it's frustrating and shit.  So I'm sure if there was, like, contact outside of the house with other people, it would be  a little more tolerable.  So I guess when the only person that you have is, like, you're alone or with me.  Like, you come home and it's playtime.  Yeah, exactly, and I'm fucking exhausted.  I'm like, get the fuck away from me.  I just want to, you know, I want to just.  You've got to watch the Gilded Cage syndrome.  I want to refresh the same five web pages over and over for the next four hours.  I mean, that's my life.  Sometimes you get, like, I'll be sitting on the couch and, you know, whatever, and 
[01:37:00]  then I'll get inspired to do something.  I'll be like, oh, I want to check this out.  I, you know, some kind of fucking camera shit or whatever, and then I'll just get up and  start doing it.  I was like, oh, I thought we were going to watch this or something.  There's DVRs now.  DVR, and we'll watch it at a later juncture.  Yeah, I had that one, too, because we were going to watch that fucking shitty Rum Diary,  Johnny Depp, and I'm, like, 20 minutes in, I already fucking hated it.  But, like, I either got a text or something happened, and, like, I went into my kitchen, 
[01:37:30]  and I'm just kind of, you know, taking care of whatever it was.  And then, you know, that came up last night, too.  It's like, oh, we're supposed to watch the movie.  And it's just like, yeah, fucking watch the movie whenever.  It doesn't fucking matter.  Why do we have to watch it that time during that specific two-hour window?  Like, we could fucking watch this movie at any time.  Yeah, the girl's got some wacky fucking shit going on.  I'm just watching it on Saturday.  I don't care.  That's why Jess is great, because every girl that I was with before Jess was like that.  Like, but Jess, you don't have to sell it.  It's okay.  We understand you're getting married.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because she doesn't mind.  Stolling her virtue.  She doesn't mind that I work. 
[01:38:00]  Like, I work all the time.  I'm always doing something on the computer.  Really?  Here?  Not here.  No.  This is my off time.  Then I go home and actually get some done.  I'm editing a video, or I'm doing something this or that.  Yeah, yeah.  She doesn't care.  She doesn't care about that.  She's like, okay, I get it.  But at the same time that, you know, you guys have been together for so long that, you know,  it's there.  Like, we haven't been together that long, you know?  Right.  So this is still new for her.  Like, for me, I, you know, I've been at this for a while, so I don't fucking, it doesn't  even, I don't even think about it, you know?  But I'm trying to.  You think so? 
[01:38:30]  I'm trying to think about it because I know I'm not thinking about it.  You think she's just in it for the robber's fortune?  Jess?  The money?  I don't think there is a robber's fortune at the moment.  Oh, shit.  I guess that helps to have the fortune if someone's going to be in it for the fortune.  And we started seeing each other when I was an intern when there was even less fortune.  Less fortune.  Again, I think potential, gross potential earnings is something that.  That's what she's gunning for?  It's a very attractive feature on me, I think.  She should just fucking go to Vegas.  I think the better odds. 
[01:39:00]  No, I think she likes me as a human being.  Yeah?  That's right.  Like most people do.  You two do seem to get along very well when I've seen you together.  It's sickening.  Is it?  Yeah, we get along perfectly.  Well, hopefully marriage will ruin all that.  Hopefully.  Yeah, once that fucking contract is in there.  Any prenups?  I don't think so.  Oh, man.  But I mean, it's like...  What if you do hit?  I don't...  You can't really...  I don't know what prenup I could ever get that would protect...  Because we've known...  She's been with me since I was an intern.  So?  So there's nothing...  I don't see her in here. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  I don't see that in here fucking whatever you do.  But there's...  Since I wouldn't make...  She's not putting on subpar quality radio for an hour a day after our show?  It's not that good.  But since I haven't made anything until we're married or until we're together while she's  been supporting me, I don't know what type of prenup would protect...  Well, let me tell you a little story about someone I know...  Tell me.  ...that didn't get a prenup when he got married.  And he wasn't doing anything spectacular at the time he got married. 
[01:40:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and then things started happening for him.  And, uh, he wound up paying through the nose because, uh, he didn't think anything was  going to happen.  No.  Yeah.  He didn't think anything was going to happen.  You know who that man was?  Who?  Uh, Mitch Kumpstein.  Mitch Kumpstein.  I know the guy.  Yeah, but can you get...  Mitch Kumpstein.  How much can you really protect if you're making the money while you're with her? 
[01:40:30]  Mmm...  I don't know.  You can protect everything.  You can?  Yeah, you can...  A prenup is just a contract that can be, uh, anything can be written in it.  And even so, like, that's a very tough sell.  Like, why would Jess sign a thing that says, if we divorce, you don't get any of my shit?  Well, the marriage contract in itself is you signing something that says, if something  happens, God forbid, that you get to give up your shit.  So why shouldn't there be a contract the other way that protects your... 
[01:41:00]  Would you ever sign a contract with a company or anything that is so one-sided and negative  toward you?  No.  If your lawyer looked over a contract that was like a marriage contract, but only for  a business, you would...  He would laugh and say, what?  You don't sign this.  The problem is, though, like, it makes sense to me because we, you and I, and I'm sure  Danny as well, think about it intellectually and it makes sense. 
[01:41:30]  It's on paper, blah, blah, blah.  Girls think very emotionally.  Yeah, and that's how they get you.  Yeah.  And so these prenups become something much more emotional than...  You know what you do?  To you or I.  You have a lawyer write one up, right?  Then you just very casually during the day when you go see her, you go, oh, by the way,  Jess, yeah, I got this.  My lawyer said, you know, it's in all of our best interests because God forbid anything 
[01:42:00]  happens and it won't.  Yeah.  It won't happen.  But this is here to protect both of us so we don't have to go through the agony of anything  should anything happen.  It seems very underhanded.  Underhanded is when a woman takes you to court and rapes you of everything you've made and  and it's just because you were married.  Don't you think that your ex-wife deserved that money, though?  No!  Not a dime of it! 
[01:42:30]  You don't think so?  No!  What about the money you paid the years after the marriage?  Oh!  Oh!  No?  No!  Not a dime!  She didn't support you?  She didn't get you here?  Please.  I remember we were drinking one night and you told me that she wrote half of those Reagan  bits.  Oh, my God!  Could you have done it without her?  So much better.  Oh.  With so much more fun to it. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  I didn't want to go back to the house on candle night.  Candle night.  Fucking candled fucking passion night where I drive home and all I'm thinking of is finishing  up that half-life fucking game and the candles are all lit in the window because she wants  to make sexy time.  You didn't want to make sexy time.  And cooks dinner and fucking makes a Captain Morgan and Coke for me and I walk in the door  and she's like, hi, and she's trying to wear something slinky.  I'm like, fuck, man! 
[01:43:30]  Danny, are you worried at all about candle night?  Like, since your chick is like at home, what if she's preparing the house for candle night  and you just want to surf the web?  I got Gordon Freeman to fucking run around this motherfucker.  The difference between my relationship and asshole relationship is that I still want to  fuck my girlfriend.  Oh.  See, that was...  See, there was the issue.  So, like, Danny would say, well, we'll fuck and then I'll play Half-Life.  Whereas you...  I'd rather look at a headcrab than her fucking pussy.  You probably were a few times.  Which looked at the same...  Yeah, they kind of looked similar.  Yeah.  Headcrams and...  Yeah, I really wanted nothing to do. 
[01:44:00]  You know what you should do?  You should call the hardware store and just ask for a butt plug.  Ah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  That was my bit.  Yeah.  I swear.  No, I...  I...  That candle...  Candle night?  See the candles burning?  She put them in the windowsill?  Yes, in the windowsill.  So you'd pull up to the house?  Like it was Christmas or fucking Paul Revere is coming to fucker?  One if I land, two if I see.  One if I ask, two if I badge. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know what?  So you'd pull up to the house and see them and what would happen?  Like, I would just get this whole scenario in my head of what the next few hours were  going to be and it didn't entail me fucking using high-tech weaponry to defeat the evil  forces that were trying to kill Gordon Freeman.  Now, I gotta ask.  So there's obviously some kind...  There was an elephant in the room here.  Yeah.  Which was, let's fuck, right?  But both of you, or at least from the stories, are just completely avoiding it. 
[01:45:00]  Or it seems that way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So why not just...  Why wasn't it just more a direct approach like, oh, you want to fuck tonight?  Or...  Well, she, like, wanted to get pregnant.  So she wanted to fuck some romance.  Oh, so she wanted, like, conception to be this magical flow of an evening.  Yeah, she didn't just want it to be like, hey, you know, I'm ovulating, let's fuck.  But I think she thought if she did that, I absolutely couldn't run in and just sit down 
[01:45:30]  at the computer and start playing Half-Life.  And she'd be in some lingerie?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She'd be in some kind of slinky thing.  Yeah.  And you couldn't be less turned on.  I was...  I could give a shit.  All I was thinking is, how long till I'm sitting in front of that computer at Black Mesa facilities?  You would drive home thinking, all right, good, I just work, I can't wait to get home  and spend six hours playing Half-Life.  Oh, six hours?  How long?  Try 20 hours. 
[01:46:00]  20 hours.  20 hours.  It's a Friday.  Four hours of sleep, perhaps.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm talking just playing that fucking game was my life.  And then...  That was it.  And then there were candles in the window.  And then the candles in the window and all I'm...  I'm just counting off like, fuck, man, I got that level.  I have to turn on the generator to supply power to the pumps to get the fucking liquid out  of the thing.  Now I gotta go...  And she's like, oh, yeah, hey, here's some fucking dinner and here's your drink so you  can fucking, you know, lick her up before you... 
[01:46:30]  Give me old tagging.  And did you...  You used to fake orgasm, right?  Yes, yes, yes.  I've told her that many times that I did not want a child.  Right.  She did.  I knew that telling her I didn't...  I put it off for as long as I could.  I said, when we first got married, I said, look, I'm on the five-year plan here.  We get married.  And it was with the band.  I thought the band would make it.  So I was like, I'm giving the band five years.  Can't have kids because I might be having a tour and shit like that. 
[01:47:00]  When you're younger and you're actually planning things, like anything in life works out to  your plans.  It's gonna work.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm gonna be a big, big star.  Well, the band didn't kick in, but radio did.  So that was about...  Let me think.  That was creeping up on the five-year mark of let's have a kid.  So I was like, look, I just got into this radio thing.  I don't know where they're gonna send us.  I don't want to be dragging a kid along.  We're gonna have to extend this five-year plan a little further.  So she let that go for maybe a year. 
[01:47:30]  And then, you know, it's like, look...  Which in hindsight, you should have just said, I got this radio thing, so I'm going to divorce you.  Yes, I am going to divorce you.  Yeah.  Because that's just what we do.  So why bother dragging a kid into this disaster that already is our marriage?  So, yeah, she would be like, oh, well, you know, we gotta have a kid.  We've been trying, but nothing happened.  Let's go to the fertility clinic.  I'd jerk off in a fucking tube.  And the reason you've been trying and nothing had happened is because you hadn't been coming in. 
[01:48:00]  Because I hadn't been doing it.  I made all the sounds.  I made the sounds.  Yeah.  And, and, oh, oh.  But don't girls, like, feel it?  Hey, I didn't give a shit.  It doesn't matter.  I, you know...  I think there was enough moisture going on down there.  And you just gave, like, an extra thrust or something.  Yeah, and I would really give a good prison lube thing.  You know, you kind of, you kind of, not, but you kind of slowly in your hand and then wipe 
[01:48:30]  it on there and then, and then, and then go.  And it leaves a little something.  I got you.  Uh, in there.  And then you make the sounds.  You, you, you pull out.  It's just so funny how much effort you went to to not come.  To not have a fucking kid is what it was.  Yeah.  Oh, I, you know, I think people, more people should go through that effort to not have children.  Why don't you just get, like, a secret vasectomy or something?  Well, I, I was, I was considering that.  But the thought of, uh, that really makes me nauseous.  Like, I can't, I get nauseous thinking about anything happening, like incisions, incisions 
[01:49:00]  on there.  And then when they pull out the, the, the tube and then do it, it like, it, it made me start.  See, even talking about it now, I'm feeling pale and faint.  I can't, uh, I can't handle that kind of thing.  So no, I wasn't going to do that.  I just figured, fuck it.  Uh, I'll keep faking it and then jacking it in the, in the can when I'm done.  Yeah.  To somebody else, by the way.  You would think about someone else?  I would think of fucking anyone else. 
[01:49:30]  I'd think of Hulk Hogan before I thought of fucking her.  Jesus Christ.  And then, um, and then it was done and, uh, I knew that, uh, no baby that month.  So instead of, like, getting up to take a piss after sex, you'd go have a jerk off.  I'd go and, uh, yeah, have a little toss, a little toss off, let the magic, uh, cumious  golden seed go right down the old shitter.  Because the last thing you could do is let that chick hold on to it.  Because she wanted it.  She would have shoved it in.  Imagine us fighting over a condom full of fucking, whew. 
[01:50:00]  Although I wouldn't have a condom because, you know.  Well, you're not going to use, oh, you don't want a kid, but you don't want to use a condom.  No, no, please.  That's silly.  Come on.  Yeah, I just didn't want a kid.  I didn't want to be with her.  I'm so glad that ended.  Yeah.  You know, it cost me an arm and a leg.  But, like I said, the prenup, uh, dude, you might want to, you know, these things happen.  You go in with the best of intentions, the most love and adoration for somebody, and, uh, 
[01:50:30]  something changes.  Shit happens.  Now, you're not living together, right?  Yeah, we live together.  Oh, okay, that's good.  It's very good.  Yeah, yeah, we've been living together for four years.  Have you consummated your relationship?  No, I've gotten to second base though.  Oh, that's good.  I love that whole thing where people don't have sex before they're married.  Yeah, no.  Because, uh, that, to me, is the death knell.  You can't not know what the hell you're in store for or not in store for.  It's like that virgin show when the two hadn't even really kissed.  Oh, and the kiss was just...  They looked like animals. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, they didn't know.  They couldn't even get their lips lined up to each other's mouth.  No, they didn't know how to do anything.  They were sucking each other's faces off.  Yeah, you really need to know what the hell you're getting into.  Like, what if you are saved...  Like, when you save all that shit for marriage, right?  Because I don't know how it works because I would never even think about that.  Hells no.  But, like, do you do other stuff before marriage?  I don't know.  Blowjobs, maybe?  Like, fingers or something?  Like, what happens?  Handies.  I'd imagine there's got to be some mutual masturbation at some point before you get married.  I would think.  No, I wouldn't get married unless I was pretty much living married life before. 
[01:51:30]  Because, like...  In sin.  How could you...  In sin.  Living in sin.  Imagine not knowing what it smells like down there or whatever.  And then, like, now you're married to this girl with some fucking stanky patch.  Oh, shit.  And that's what you got to deal with now?  And you're stuck with it.  You'll probably get it annulled, I bet.  On stinky pussy grounds.  Well, her pussy smells.  That's a big...  I want an annulment.  I don't care how much I like you.  Like, if your pussy reeks, like, it's...  75% of your points are gone. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, that's a deal breaker for you?  Big time.  That's a big deduction.  That is a big time...  I'm sorry, but it's important.  It is.  What am I going to say?  I mean...  It's a scent.  What if my fucking cock smell like feta cheese nonstop?  I don't know.  I wouldn't like that.  I mean, no girl's going to be happy about that.  Right?  Oh, man.  Like, what if they found out that I hadn't been circumcised at age 19?  Oh, shit.  What if that thing was still there?  And they'd be like, what the fuck is that?  What is that?  I want to talk about the contest that I pitched to management last week, since we're bringing  up your penis.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  You know, we have our staff meetings every Tuesday.  Well, of course, it keeps the ship running out.  And they want us pitching bits and stuff.  Yeah, they want to know what we could do in Cleveland.  They want to bit, right?  So I was thinking that we could have a Sam's Penis Challenge, where we all put condoms on  our cock like his foreskin, and we all have to blow up balloons with our pets.  Pissing them.  Like pissing on them.  Yeah, like a carnival game.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you got to pop the balloon, like shooting the water in the clown's mouth.  They're not going to let us do that.  No, of course not.  It's body fluids.  I can't do the body fluids. 
[01:53:00]  But it was great because like, I just know that's how Sam's penis functioned.  Like that's, that's really what it was, right?  Yes.  I love that.  Yes.  Like if you ever needed a visual, like if everybody who's thinking about the Sam Cox story, like  if you're still confused about what's going on, that's what's going on.  It was like pissing inside of a balloon with a small balloon over your dick.  With a pinhole size incision at the end.  You had to regulate the speed of your piss so your foreskin wouldn't fill up.  It filled up every time I had to pinch it.  That's what I'm saying.  That's bizarre. 
[01:53:30]  This is great.  It's fantastic.  I don't know why more time I should have been spent on this.  You spent that many years blowing up your foreskin with your own piss?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  And then instead of, instead of first, instead of now, you know, you shake it when you're  done, you pinch and shake.  Oh, God.  Pinch, pinch, pinch, shake, shake, shake.  But then the head of your dick was always surrounded by piss.  How would you clean in there?  In now, looking now, I'm like, yeah, that probably was some, but you know, once the surgery  went down, I guess the doctor cleaned all that up because now it looks, it looks, ladies, 
[01:54:00]  it looks wonderful.  This is disgusting.  It smells nice too.  Talking about fucking dick smells and cunt smells.  You guys brought it up.  This fucking show sucks.  Fucking rude.  Oh, man.  Really?  Jesus.  Farts and smells.  I know.  Just disgusting guy shit.  Let's take another break.  Yeah.  John Bernthal is coming in at 9.30.  Yeah.  He's going to talk about what his dick smells like. 
[01:54:30]  We're going to talk about his dick.  And no, I think we got something.  Something from Whitney.  What is it?  Not Whitney.  She's dead.  Whitney's daughter.  Yeah.  Something.  I got to tell you something.  You know, a banana, Whitney Houston.  God rest her soul.  But boy, is that fucking daughter ugly.  Fucking butt ugly.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry to offend.  I'm not going to use any epithets.  I'm not going to say anything bad. 
[01:55:00]  No firing offense.  But I could comment on people.  And in my opinion, she is an ugly fucking girl.  A massive forehead and a giant gap between your two front teeth is not.  That fucking Mike Tyson gappy tooth motherfucking thing she's got going is heinous.  Yeah.  She definitely.  She got the Bobby Brown kind of face.  Yes.  Thing going.  She didn't get the young Whitney look.  But in.  Yeah.  She's talking to Oprah.  And what a forehead. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  That's what I was saying.  One of those weird hairlines that go right back to her.  The middle of her head.  Yeah.  She needs bangs terribly.  Yeah.  Definitely.  She needs some bangage.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back and hear what I guess she was saying to Ofra.  Yeah.  She's talking to Ofra.  She still feels Whitney in the house and talks to her.  Oh.  They call it the hizzy.  It's healthy.  The his.  All right.  All right.  Be back in a flash.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:56:00]  On the next episode of American Fuckers, Mike and Frank travel the back roads of America  looking for rusty gold.  We are, man.  We're in Manteques.  We're making rust hot.  Me and Frankie are the rock stars of rust.  They're looking for amazing antiques to fuck buried in people's garages and barns.  What happens is you get in these barns and stuff and I'll f*** anything that's transportation  related.  I f*** a 1913 Indian in a barn.  I f*** a 1913 Harley in a barn.  Yeah.  It's hard to really get the boner on.  Yeah.  That's hard. 
[01:56:30]  You know what I mean?  What most people see as junk they try and stick their dicks into.  Oil cans, gas pumps.  Everything.  Different heights, sizes, shapes.  Everything.  Four wheels, two wheels.  You know.  Memorabilia.  Beer cans.  That was smoking, man.  I did high five them.  I was like, dude, that was awesome.  We can't just be a one trick pony.  I mean, we've got a f*** a lot of different things.  You know, all of a sudden brass blade fans are hot.  I love brass blade fans.  I want a dry hump of brass blade fans.  They're f***ing the history of America one piece at a time.  You know, nothing surprises us anymore, I don't think.  Yeah.  We're f***ing cool stuff.  The cool thing about us is, you know, we get excited about just about anything. 
[01:57:00]  You know, we're just looking for stuff we have never f***ed before.  Find out which forgotten relics will get f***ed.  Yeah.  Woo.  Woo.  All on the next episode of American Fuckers.  It's the Anthony Show.  My f***ing show.  We're going to talk about racism and guns.  Racism and guns are my f***ing show.  So don't even bother trying to call in motherf***ers.  Because Anthony don't take no f***ing phone calls. 
[01:57:30]  I guess that's true.  I don't take any calls.  People give me flack over that.  But, you know, I've had a lot of experience with phone calls over the years of doing radio.  And for the most part, they really don't send me.  You know what I mean?  It's usually, if the guy even knows they're on the air, while they're at that awkward exchange, you go, you're on, you're on, Bob, Bob, go, go.  Oh, it's Rob. 
[01:58:00]  Rob, whatever.  And then they never really quite hit the mark with what they're supposed to be talking about.  And they don't know when to get out.  Well, it always looks so appealing, nice and concise on the phone screen.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  When it's screened and written down, it looks like, yeah, like it should actually work.  But it's never what it is.  It rarely does.  I was watching, well, I was listening, just listening to the American Fuckers bit, which is fucking hilarious.  And I realized I was watching, I was watching Pawn Stars last night. 
[01:58:30]  I like that show.  That show seems pretty honest for the most part.  Not like that hardcore pawn, which is all fake bullshit where black guys come in and try to sell their fucking Nintendos and want $1,000.  When I went to the gold and silver, the world famous gold and silver pawn shop in Ritzy, Las Vegas, I wanted to go and visit Chumlee and he wasn't there.  He wasn't working? 
[01:59:00]  So I think it's fake.  Oh, you think they'd just go in there?  The old man wasn't there.  Who was?  No one.  Fucking really scary looking people.  No one from the show?  No, I didn't see anybody.  That's going to suck.  I guess they're all about the show now.  I mean, I knew they weren't really going to be there.  Why?  But they should be, right?  I just wanted to go and check it out.  They didn't even really have that much shit there.  Yeah.  To be honest, I mean, like, it's just a regular, honestly, it's just a regular pawn shop.  I don't have, like, they don't have all, like, those super cool shit, like, out on display.  Like, there's a couple of cool things.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, and half the shop is retail now because they're so popular. 
[01:59:30]  The half of the store is legitimately T-shirts, mugs, magnets, and big cardboard cutouts all  the way in the back.  So you could, because they're not there, you could take your picture with the cardboard.  Holy fuck.  Why would you do that?  Wow.  So they're just there for the fucking filming of the show?  At this point, yeah.  Which is a full-time job, I guess.  I'm not sure at one point it was a little more real, but at this point, I mean, look,  they're just mega popular.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  There would be people just all day going in there, busting that guy's balls, probably.  That show did take off.  And then you watch that stupid other one, that hardcore pawn, and it's like, they don't 
[02:00:00]  have that personality thing going.  Like, those guys are very personable.  Yeah, and they're all different in their own way.  I think that's what makes a lot of these shows work, is when these guys have, you know,  really polarized personalities, let's say.  And the other ones I see just don't do that.  And like, I haven't, I think I watched like five minutes of that Cajun one.  Yeah.  Like, Cajun Pawn Stars.  Like, I could give a fuck about that.  Well, the other ones, it seems like they're poorly written shows.  Like, it seems like they're fake, and nobody's developed this character at all. 
[02:00:30]  Cajun Stars is poorly written, too.  I mean, like, there's always some kind of arc in every episode.  It's retarded.  It's always, you know, Chumlee dropping, so he broke, so that's all fake, and we know  it.  But the people themselves strike you as real three-dimensional people.  It's at least, it's not palatable, but it works because we all know that it's a good,  like, we all know that it's goof for goof's sake.  Like, no one's really believing that, like, Chumlee fell asleep on the boss's couch or whatever.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And so, is it lame?  Of course it is.  I wonder why they feel they have to put that shit in. 
[02:01:00]  Like, it's interesting enough to just do a show where people bring shit in, you learn  about it, you learn a little history, and then they try to rip the guy off by lowballing  the fuck out of him.  It's the point, well, you know what, it's just the fucking rape and pornification of  the Discovery Channel.  Like, it used to be, like, a legitimate network for things.  It's like, and now it's just become so...  Girls like those little things.  Do they?  Like Chumlee falling asleep on the boss's couch or whatever.  Is that trying to get the female demo in?  Yeah, girls like those little kind of weird, wacky, funny, you know, lame little bits that 
[02:01:30]  they do that are fake.  But, like...  And I'm sure on some level the girls know that they're fake but don't really conceptualize  that part of it.  They just like it.  I like when people come in and they're like, well, what are you looking for?  I'm looking for $5,000.  Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not gonna happen.  All right, well, make me offer.  I'm thinking more $300.  Yeah.  I was like, what?  How the fuck?  Or, like, when somebody comes in and with this, like, you know, this big... 
[02:02:00]  It's a real, you know, World War II era, blah, blah, blah.  And they're like, well, this is a replica.  And you can see the stamp right here will tell you that.  Yeah, I can give you $75 for it.  They crush dreams.  And, like, you could see the water in their eyes build up because it was sitting in their  closet and they thought they were gonna get thousands of dollars for years.  There's one guy...  This is an older one, so I'm sure you guys have probably seen it.  The guy that comes into the Pawn Stars with his Pez collection.  Oh, yeah.  And he gets, like...  He fucking seriously gets mad. 
[02:02:30]  Like, he's like, I got this Batman right here.  It's still in the dang...  Just one alone.  Just one alone.  Yeah, exactly.  He's like, I can get, like, $5,000 for all this Pez.  Just one alone.  And, like, you know, they didn't...  And they offered him.  They're like, I don't know.  We'll give you, like, $500.  Like, they didn't give a fuck about Pez.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy's a Pez fanatic.  And he walked out in a hot...  Like, he took his Pez and went home.  He was like, fuck those guys.  It's always like...  They're like, I can get $5,000 for this, so go get it.  So go get it.  Yeah, exactly.  Go get $5,000 for it.  And I like when they bring in the expert to go over the piece.  And it's like, well, what do you got here? 
[02:03:00]  Well, this is an authentic wooden box from the banking...  The bank...  What was that old?  Wells Fargo.  Yeah.  It's a Wells Fargo banking box that they used to put on the stagecoaches.  And it's very valuable.  And then the guy looks at it and goes, yeah, these hinges are cast in a modern foundry.  And this doesn't...  This isn't the way.  And these were numbered in a certain way.  And pretty much tell the guy he's got shit.  You have a wooden box. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lady with a fucking, like, a really rare quarter, you know?  And so they're looking at it and he goes, he goes, oh, the mint mark looks a little funny.  And you could see...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could see in her brain when she swallowed it and went, goop.  It's like, yeah, people will take the D and cut it and alter it to make a C out of it.  Like, that bitch knew she was trying to fucking hawk a phony coin.  She knew it.  She had an actual surprise.  Really?  Oh, no.  They know their shit is another thing that makes the show good. 
[02:04:00]  You had a punch up in Las Vegas.  It's the scum of the earth visiting the scum of the earth.  Yeah, they better know what the fuck.  They're trying to sell their shit to the scum of the earth.  And then they gave one of the experts a spinoff show.  The guy who redoes everything.  Oh, yeah, American Restoration.  Yeah, he was from Pawn Stars.  Yeah.  And now he's got his own little program for himself.  Hey, good for him, though.  Fuck him.  You know, he's talented.  It's not like he's just some twat like Kim Kardashian who can't fucking do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy's got a skill, a real-world skill.  He just happened to get a TV show out of it.  That's the way it fucking should be. 
[02:04:30]  Pretty fucking amazing that he whips those things back into shape.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't care what's written on that show.  You know, it's not fucking fake the way he takes old shit and restores it.  Yeah, makes it look great.  That's what the show's supposed to be about.  I like it.  Kim Kardashian got very mad at Jon Hamm from Mad Men for calling her an idiot in an interview.  Well, she's an idiot.  Well, she doesn't.  But she is an idiot.  She thinks she owns a business and has a...  So does Paris Hilton.  And has a...  Well, that's what he said.  Jon Hamm said Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, you know, idiot behavior is rewarded. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Good.  Good for him.  Fuck them.  But she took great offense because she thinks she owns a business and protects a brand.  Right.  Didn't realize that her father got a murderer off.  I think started complaining about murderers.  Didn't realize the irony in the statements she made.  There's a couple of new shows coming on that I'm very excited about.  What's that one?  What?  Niecy?  Oh, yeah.  Which...  I don't know.  But it's Niecy's whole family.  Yeah.  What are we talking about here?  Leave it to Niecy. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Leave it to Niecy.  And...  Yeah.  You're excited about that one?  I am so excited.  It's on TLC.  Yeah.  And it seems to be a bunch of black people.  She was on Celebrity Wife Swap and Reno 911.  Oh, is that who she is?  She's the chick from Reno 911.  I have no idea and I could give a shit.  Really?  But all I saw was a lot of people in the promo dancing.  Sure.  Dancing.  They're getting their dance on and shit.  I'm sure there'll be a cookout or two. 
[02:06:00]  A cookout.  Why would you say that?  She's like, hi, I'm Niecy.  Niecy likes to cook.  Oh, okay.  I'm Niecy.  Yeah.  Give us a little volume on this one.  I'm an actor.  I've been a dancing star.  And told jokes for a living.  But my real life is like a sitcom.  You will try blending my three kids, my outspoken mother, my gorgeous husband, his son, and yours truly.  And see if you have a picture of happiness.  But hey, leave it to Niecy. 
[02:06:30]  You ain't gonna watch that?  Report card.  Where is it?  Report card.  Check that overall grade is a B.  Oh, this is written.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fake show.  Fake.  Take a nice little.  Enjoy that.  Enjoy that.  Why did you only get this in this class?  Because I got my other report card.  Okay, I have a problem with this.  A, she's in school.  B, there's parenting going on.  I know.  What the fuck?  And she's not talking with any type of weird inflection. 
[02:07:00]  There must be more to this.  Yeah.  Playing off stereotypes.  Did you see that one?  Yeah.  Huh?  That grade sucked.  It sucked, if you want to put it.  Okay, listen, though.  But don't you have to maintain a certain level of grade in all this in order to play sports?  I already started.  What did you do?  Play football.  She sounds like a white kid from the fucking valley.  Okay.  Take me back. 
[02:07:30]  Going back.  Did y'all actually play football?  It's not an organic conversation.  Why am I supposed to give a flying fuck about this?  My life is like a sitcom.  My daughter brings home report card.  Yeah.  And I talked to her about it.  And she says what sports she's playing.  And I'm not feeling it, yo.  You're not feeling this one?  I ain't feeling this show.  How is this part of, like, the trailer?  And this is the part they decided to put on the website to catch people.  This is going to hook me?  This is the sizzle reel. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  This is it.  And this is the first part of the sizzle reel.  Yeah.  There's still, guys, there's still two minutes on this.  Oh, my God.  Let's go a little further.  Maybe it catches up.  Is it all boys?  Is that why you joined it?  Because it's all boys?  Mommy didn't raise no fool.  Hi.  No, but Mommy didn't raise nobody.  She's going to slap the black off of.  Oh, she is.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  That's fucking disgusting.  I don't see colors when I watch shows like that.  I don't. 
[02:08:30]  I didn't even realize they were black until she brought it up.  I know.  Until fucking she said it.  I don't even see colors.  I was like, oh, this is Niecy's family.  Then I don't get the jokes about parenting in good grades anymore.  Oh, right.  Whoops.  I don't.  I'm not filling that show.  Not filling it.  No.  Maybe I will fill Sweetie Pies.  That's another show.  Sweetie Pies.  Sweetie Pies is another show.  Apparently, it's a pie shop.  Oh, my God.  They're making shows about everything. 
[02:09:00]  The cake thing was already done, so they still had pies?  Yeah, yeah.  So, Sweetie Pies is on the OWN network.  That's Oprah Winfrey's network.  I also, now looking at this website, know why you don't like this show.  Oh, well.  Yeah, because I could give a shit about pies.  There's something in common with both this and the Niecy's show.  And Niecy's show.  They all star Tyler Perry.  Yeah.  Tyler Perry.  Are there any clips of this show?  I guess.  I mean, we can meet. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, online exclusive sneak peek.  First five minutes.  Watch the first five minutes of Sweetie Pies.  Let's see the first five minutes.  Maybe Sweetie Pies.  Here's the first five minutes, but I just saw a trailer, too.  That might work a little better.  All right.  As far as flow goes.  Watch the official trailer.  Maybe if we like it, we could hit the full clip.  Sweetie Pies, motherfucker.  Man, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Maybe.  Oprah.com.  Damn me.  In the beginning, it was my singing that had soul. 
[02:10:00]  I was an Ike Gap, a backup singer in the Ike and Tina Turner reveal.  Oh, shit.  So in my lung collapse, and I could no longer sing, this soul sister turned to soul food.  So I opened my own restaurant.  And one thing's for sure, this family means business.  My son, Tim, tackles everything from the body to our employees.  Tim's girlfriend, Jenae, she's responsible for taking care of Tim.  My nephew, Charles, he works hard at not working. 
[02:10:30]  And this problem is at the head of his family business.  Welcome to Sweetie Pie.  Charles?  Yes?  Give me the damn key.  You just got to working.  You out here smoking already?  Bring your ass in.  Put that cigarette out.  What are you doing?  Grabbing my phone.  Okay, but it looks like you're having a tea time conversation here.  Oh, man.  She really doesn't take any gum.  No.  Don't make sense.  You know Jenae's pregnant.  Of course she is.  I think I'm about to suppose. 
[02:11:00]  What?  Hey.  And they're not married.  You didn't taste okay?  You're sitting there talking to a girl.  I won't say nothing.  What you doing with that short-ass dress on?  I ain't say that, did I?  Give me five grand on there to get some cash, and then I can take the ring with me.  You sure you know what you're doing?  You're living under false pretext like the man you're living above your knees.  Are they going to subtitle this show?  I sure hope so.  They want the documents.  They want the house.  The house is on the lawn.  It's a collateral.  So if we don't get the lawn, then what are we going to do?  Oh, man.  The drama.  It's not going to run a successful family business, but in the end, it's all worth it. 
[02:11:30]  It's worth it.  Sweetie Pie.  It's on the Sweetie Pie's coming this October.  Rock-tober.  You're going to get Sweetie Pie.  So because it's on the Oprah channel, it has to be about a black business?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know how Oprah kind of wants to showcase black businesses.  I just don't get it.  I mean, it's been talked about to death on this program, but if it was just like some  Christian network with all white family programming, black people would go crazy.  Yeah, it's like, we need more diversity on Oprah's channel, I think. 
[02:12:00]  I'm not seeing a lot of diversity there.  I know, for someone who wants to...  They got Rosie as their anchor.  She's a lesbian.  Oh, right.  That's diversity.  How about just some, you know...  And of all, like, the...  I guess, I mean, I can't tell if this is interesting or not by watching the first 40 seconds of  that.  I'm sure it's not.  I'm sure it's not interesting.  Where, like, wasn't there more applications to sort through before you pick this?  Like, I'm sure there's more interesting people or families or something.  Some family that just runs a fucking...  Some fucking Ike Turner backup center. 
[02:12:30]  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah, that's the celebrity part of it, where she's like, well, you know, she used to be  a celebrity.  She watched fucking Ike beat the shit out of Tina so many times.  You know what she must have seen?  Tell those stories.  Fuck the pies.  Tell the time when Ike beat Tina with a car antenna.  I want to watch a reality show about, like, Lawrence Fishburne and his family.  Yeah.  Hey, your daughter fucked another dude online today.  And, you know, I'd rather see the workings of that kind of a family than just people trying  to make a pie business where... 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  ...gives a shit about pies.  There's another show that...  They're just getting lower and lower in the line of what people do to get on television  where two guys literally just walk around with those dumb metal detectors and try to  find shit.  Oh, I saw it.  It's called meteorite men.  Yeah, yeah.  But even that, the guys kind of have some kind of knowledge about meteors and what they  look like and where you'd find them.  And they find, like, meteors. 
[02:13:30]  Meteor shit.  You look at...  I gotta take this up the college.  Mr. Vero, I wouldn't give you two cents for a broken meteor.  Always in.  Always bad.  Vero luck.  Just do Creepshow.  I'd like it.  Creepshow dialogue for the rest of the show.  I don't even remember what we were talking about.  I know, right?  It's two guys walking around with metal detectors just trying to find shit.  And they find, like...  Like, they promo'd this one.  They kept teasing. 
[02:14:00]  Because I watched the first show.  Sure.  And they're going around and the guy goes, beep, beep, beep.  I found something.  I think I found a gun.  And, like, a gun.  And they were searching for, like, Civil War stuff.  So, it was like, oh!  And they must have played that clip three times going into commercials.  They finally get to it.  And the guy pulls it out.  And it's half of a toy gun.  And it was so just anticlimactic.  Not that I was looking for anything climactic in the show.  It's two guys with fucking metal detectors.  Yeah, but, I mean, as dumb as those shows... 
[02:14:30]  I watch Storage Wars every time it's on TV.  Every time.  How do auctioning off people's shit...  Not only will I watch it every time it's on TV,  but I know that the show will never be as good as the teases right before break.  Yeah.  But I will always say, all right, I'm going to turn it off next break.  And then there'll be a tease.  And I'm like, actually...  That looks pretty good.  I'm going to check out what's in that locker.  One more break.  It's never good.  Because they show the people's faces.  They show the locker opening.  And they show people go, yeah!  Whoa!  And then it's nothing.  It's a different reaction. 
[02:15:00]  It's the reaction to something totally different.  Yes.  It's not the locker.  There's nothing in it.  But I watch Storage Wars, like, marathons of it.  I was watching the fat show.  That's my 600-pound life.  Right.  Last night.  And then afterwards, they had a show about former fat people that just had a lot of skin.  A guy and a woman.  And the woman, they showed her naked, except, you know, they blurred out her nips.  They didn't even have to blur out a pussy because the fat was hanging over it.  The skin.  She was built like a Peter Griffin body? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, worse.  She was worse than Peter Griffin.  You couldn't tell the up from down from sight.  It was horrible.  And then they lay her down for the operation, and they literally cut, like, a strip around her entire body on about at bottom of rib level to, like, groin level all the way around your body in a circle.  And then just take that circle off.  And then sew it together. 
[02:16:00]  And it was horror.  It was a horror show.  So much skin.  It's so much fucking skin.  And then they show the guy trying to lift the skin.  And then they show the people the skin.  In recovery, they wheel it in on a big table and say, here it is.  And there's, like, hair growing out of it.  And the guy's touching what was part of his living being.  It's flesh.  Yeah, yeah.  It was so fucking disgusting.  And then that guy's stitches popped or something and got infected.  He had a baseball-sized hole. 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  A baseball-sized hole where you could look in and see his muscles, like, working.  That's his skin.  Oh, it was sick.  They had to do things and put drains in, and it's draining out what looks like cranberry juice.  It was so disgusting.  I don't know why I watch these shows.  You've got to double-stitch that if you're going to sew someone's skin up.  Sew the skin completely.  They literally cut him in half as far as the skin goes and then slap it together and try to sew it. 
[02:17:00]  But, yeah, that was really heinous.  There's drains that have to go in.  That show was disgusting.  And then, of course, my 600-pound life.  They tracked these people for seven years.  Seven fucking years.  That's a hell of an investment.  And one guy, he wound up, I guess the operation paralyzed him or something.  He caught something and got paralyzed and got just as fat as he was in the wheelchair.  So it's like, what did the operation do to you?  Well, I'm still just as fat, and now I can't move. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  Yeah, that one went awry.  It's hard to have sympathy for that, though.  Oh, man.  I know your life got even more fucked up, but it was your own fault in the first place.  Yeah, yeah.  Shouldn't have been that fucking fat.  Sorry.  Kanye West's mom goes in for, like, a tummy tuck and a breast augmentation and dies.  That's the operation.  That's your operation.  Hope you look good in the coffin.  Yeah, those shows are, it is hard to be sympathetic.  And the family members are despicable because they're total enablers. 
[02:18:00]  All of them are fat.  And then when one of these guys, they were actually driving him home from the hospital after his operation, like a secondary skin operation to lose the weight.  And they're like, well, we better stop off and get Mama something to eat.  And they stopped off at a fast food place and just picked up horrid burgers.  And they're all shoving it in their face in the house.  And he goes, man, I probably picked a bad time to come home.  Like, you think the family would be a little more sympathetic? 
[02:18:30]  Of course.  A little more supportive and not shove horrible burgers in their fat faces?  All the family members on all those shows, Hoarders, Intervention, they're all the people that made the people what they are.  But family members got to eat, you know?  Well, I hear you.  I hear you.  But maybe you shouldn't eat in front of former fatty guy.  I'm trying to get mine, though.  I want mine.  And Intervention is one of my favorite shows because I just think how available some of those girls would be to me. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  You know, I don't know if it would be a good relationship, to be honest with you.  I actually know that it would not be a good relationship.  Well, I've been in relationships with some real lunatics.  Yeah.  And some of these girls come off as true crazy people.  And I find that something kind of hot about it.  I can see where the turn-on is, but long-term, it's just more difficult and more difficult. 
[02:19:30]  I know.  But you know what?  You are getting laid the first date.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The first time out of the gate, if you have a little plastic fucking baggie or a little glassine packet of some goodies for her, so easy.  So fucking easy.  And you would do that if you met one of these intervention chicks, get whatever drug they were on.  One of the hot ones, yeah.  And then just kind of slip them some drugs and say, but you know, there's certain, you don't have to pay for it.  Yeah.  But I'd appreciate a favor in return.  There's been a couple of fucking hotties on there that, you know, it's like, well, you know. 
[02:20:00]  And then I start getting that savior complex where I'm like, I bet I could make her stop.  That I know, yeah.  I bet I could make her stop.  And, you know, all she needs is a little loving and shit.  Yeah, she doesn't have the right people in her life.  If she had a happier life with somebody who could make her happy.  Meanwhile, she's a wild drug addict that would sell everything in my house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she would lie to you.  She would say, I'm so happy with you.  And do all her drugs behind your back.  Do her drugs. 
[02:20:30]  Fuck other guys.  Oh, yeah.  For money, for more drugs.  And, you know, she would be fucking black guys behind your back.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  Like the movie Traffic.  Imagine in my house.  In your house is where it would happen.  In the morning.  You'd be doing this show.  Oh, man.  And you'd be like, ha, ha, ha.  I'm making jokes.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, and in your bed.  I'm punching up one of my cameras right now.  Hold on.  I got to look.  I have to look now at the camera. 
[02:21:00]  Check it just in case.  I don't think you're dating an addict currently.  Okay.  There's that.  There's the front door.  Just double check everything.  It looks pretty good.  What the hell is that laying there?  Oh, boy.  Is it a black guy?  No, I don't think it's a black guy.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, no, we're good.  We're good.  Thank God for security cams.  I know.  Well, there's no one at home that's going to be having sex with black people anyway.  I don't think police like that. 
[02:21:30]  I see.  Yeah.  I understand.  Well.  But, yeah, that would be the downfall of the relationship with the addict.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although, I figure I could save her, but I wouldn't want to get her off the drugs.  Well, you'd save her.  Not in that way.  You wouldn't save her.  You'd save her, like, holding her captive.  Yeah, well.  Like, you'd lock her in your house so she couldn't get out.  Gilded cage.  Right.  It's a gilded cage.  The door is always open, but they don't want to leave. 
[02:22:00]  No.  Because they got the life going on in there.  And I would still get her drugs.  Right.  But, you know.  That's why she'd stay.  Right.  You'd supply her with drugs.  You've got to keep her drugged up.  You'd trick her into thinking that nobody else was looking for her.  Yeah.  Clean needles, though.  Clean needles.  Make sure of that.  And, you know, anything she needs.  She needs some hot clothes to walk around the house in.  I'm not going to put her in rags.  And you could make sure she doesn't do too many drugs.  Right.  No ODing in my fucking shit. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  I don't need some fucking poobah.  What did he say?  Otherwise, you end up like, what's his name in Boogie Nights, who just likes to look at  the colonel.  The colonel.  I don't want to be the colonel.  Some fucked up poobah.  So next time I bring some fucked up poobah over your house, whatever the line was, Pulp  Fiction.  Yeah, I would do that.  Some of them are hot, though.  Maybe worth the trouble?  Very rarely are they hot.  Yeah, but you wouldn't want them around all the time, even if they were hot. 
[02:23:00]  Wouldn't you eventually get over their hotness because there's so much trouble to upkeep?  They're easy to throw out, though, too.  Once you're done.  Yeah.  Once the maintenance has become too much, you just put them out on the doorstep.  And you could blame them for everything and why the relationship ended.  You're a fucking drug addict.  Your drug use stink.  Not, you know, rationalizing the fact that you.  I just used her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just using her.  Sure.  Like she uses drugs.  You use her.  All right. 
[02:23:30]  Maybe it doesn't work out.  No.  Maybe this scenario.  I took that scenario a little further than I normally do.  And I think that it helped.  Probably would.  But it could be good just for some regular old fucking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Summertime.  I think it's a good summer thing to do.  Because that's like a.  While the pool's open.  That's like a funner, wilder time.  Yeah.  And you don't have to be in the house all the time.  No.  Just doing drugs and listening to her moan with that heroin look on her face.  You probably don't want to let her in the house at all.  Like you probably want to hang out with her in the backyard always. 
[02:24:00]  Keep her in the pool house.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because even if she sells everything in the pool house for drugs, what's in the pool house?  Yeah.  Just cushions.  It's replaceable.  Exactly.  Oh, what do we got?  Oh, no, no.  Eric was just distracting me.  That guy.  I've seen him before in the top corner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy just looks ridiculous.  It's on Fox News.  Yeah.  Some correspondent that they have.  Yeah.  He's got that wacky silver helmet hair.  Helmet hair.  Helmet hair.  Michio Kaku hair.  Looks like Dr. Light from fucking Mega Man.  Michio Kaku hair. 
[02:24:30]  He does kind of have that.  I thought for a second a guest was here, but I couldn't tell because of the now incredibly  intrusive black name logo tape that is going around the entire studio window.  I saw this here on Sunday and I knew because the thing is there's decals on the windows  that say the Opie and Anthony show and they were replacing the ones we had with ones that  would reverse so you see it on both sides, not backwards.  Yeah.  Now there's just a black bar that runs all around it. 
[02:25:00]  So every time you look through at somebody, it looks like you're looking at a censored  portion of beaver hunt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where they would black out the eyes in order to shield their identity.  That's what everything looks like.  That's what everything is.  And when people come down the hallway, unless it's like Roland, because I can only see the  lower part of their body, I don't know who the fuck it is.  So guests just kind of creep up on you now.  Well, they creep up on you. 
[02:25:30]  You want to?  Bugs?  Mr. Pratt?  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  Bugs.  Well, how is he?  He killed himself, you bastard.  You son of a bitch.  That one's not as quotable as...  No, it's very...  He's got some great lines, though.  He's got some great lines in that one.  Yeah, but I can't...  I can't see, goddammit.  Why didn't they...  They might have put it a little, I don't know, higher or lower.  I don't know.  It's right in my line of sight. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I guess the idea is that way it's in eyesight so you can see the logo, not putting  together the fact that if it's in your eyesight, the logo now blocks out actually seeing what's  going on in the hallway.  Yeah, in case you didn't notice, we're really hyping the Opie and Anthony show here.  Yeah, yeah.  What is it?  What are those four?  Like, we see them.  We know who we are.  Why is it facing in?  It's on both sides.  Yeah, but why couldn't they just do the ones facing out without the black...  Oh, for video?  For video.  Oh, for video. 
[02:26:30]  But we have all this on the walls.  Yeah, we rarely...  I mean, I...  But what if you're facing that way?  You could just put the Opie and Anthony show in the corner of the video.  That's true.  It doesn't actually have to be plastered on the wall anymore.  That's true.  Virtually, you can put that in.  You can literally type in the words.  I think they've reached the point where they can do that.  Yeah.  To tell you the truth.  Like, NBC doesn't put that little peacock in the corner of their camera.  It's actually superimposed in post. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  Not a real peacock.  Imagine watching 30 Rock and it said 30 Rock everywhere, like, on the wallpaper.  Just so they could, yeah, to get the logo.  Yeah, that makes no sense.  Oh, boy.  I'm not going to sit here and bitch about it.  Although I think I just did.  Brother.  Did Anthony see Allison intervention?  Which one was that?  I think that's the huffing bitch.  Oh, the huffing bitch?  Yeah, I was just searching her out.  She was a fucking mess.  And she's not all that great, but she cleaned up pretty well.  I just want to bang her because she looks like someone I know. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  But she cleaned up pretty well, though.  Her drug would be so easy to get for you.  You could keep her in your house and just buy a computer duster.  Computer fucking duster, yeah.  She loved that stuff.  Is she somebody that you would bring over and try to make into your sex life?  The thing is, not when she was huffing.  No.  Yeah.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  Would you get her now that she's not huffing and try to get her to start huffing again? 
[02:28:00]  No.  Is that her?  No.  This is the other person who I think looks like the other person.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  You're right.  A little bit of that going on.  Yeah, she does.  But, yeah, that's why I like Allison the huffer.  The huffer.  Yeah, she ended up getting off of it, totally cleaning herself up.  Yeah, one wasted.  It's a shame.  Yeah, I like the, unfortunately, the meth heads are the ones that have the most damage done. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, oh my God, yeah, all right.  Yeah, come on, we all remember her.  Yeah, yeah, we do.  We do.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Oh, that's not going to happen.  Ha, ha, nah.  Ah, well.  Oh, wells.  All right, let's take a break.  Thank you, Don.  And what do we got?  Another 35 minutes.  Oh, our big guest from The Walking Dead.  I hope you're caught up, people.  Oh, boy, do I hope you're caught up.  You're going to be awful mad.  Yeah, and if you're not caught up, read issue six. 
[02:29:00]  Uh-oh.  How about that?  Issue six.  Because that's how long ago you should have known about all this.  Danny gets mad when people watch TV shows instead of reading the comics.  I know, yeah.  Well, because everyone's acting like it's like the biggest thing in the world.  And I'm trying to equate it to like, what if all of a sudden I got into Lost and I'm  talking about, oh, my God, did you see what happened to Ben?  And everybody would be like, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, but the TV show is much bigger than the comic.  I don't know.  I'd beg to differ.  Yeah?  Pop culture-wise?  I mean, I think there's a more people.  I think it's on TV because of the comic.  It's not like this is like people are finding the comics because it's on TV. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, but people are more aware of it when it's on television.  It's on TV in the hizzy, Dr. Gay.  Hey, Dr. Gay.  Oh, I thought you had some good info for us about Walking Dead.  It's on TV.  Exactly.  It's on TV.  Yeah, but, you know, it's also.  Not everybody reads comic books.  That's what I'm saying.  I know.  People are aware of it because it's on television.  It's a graphic novel.  Yeah, we don't all read graphic novels.  No, and I'm not saying that you have to. 
[02:30:00]  You don't have to read graphic novels to know about Walking Dead.  Yeah, I know.  It's on TV.  Oh, yes.  I got to admit, I am a TV guy.  I'm not.  I'm really not a comic book guy.  Do you understand that you're now too lazy to read comic books?  You'd rather watch TV than read a comic book.  I said that when I was 16.  But I'd rather.  Yeah, but I always would rather.  I'm not going to read comic books anymore.  I've seen television than read comics.  But you're still going to watch a TV show about a zombie invasion.  Yeah, sure.  But you won't read a comic book about it.  It's the same thing.  No, no, no.  It's completely different.  And actually, the comic book is probably way more dark and graphic. 
[02:30:30]  You wouldn't know, you stopped watching.  But I like the zombies, how they look on the TV.  Right.  I like how they look.  They look like, oh, their lips are always chewed off.  I'm never like, man, that makeup department at Image Comics is really awesome.  Oh, that tracer did a great job.  Don't ever ask why your fucking Pawn Stars episode needs a story arc.  Oh, shit.  They can make a Pawn Stars comic.  Would you watch that?  Chumley falls asleep, everyone's laughing.  Hey, how much for this in a speech bubble? 
[02:31:00]  And the guy's thinking, this is a piece of shit.  I just can't get into it.  I mean, some people are really hard into fucking comics.  Yeah, and I'm not.  I just can't get it.  I've watched, have you watched Kevin Smith's show about the comic book store there?  It's just, they have, they're so into comic books that it's like, it's, it's just so geeky.  Yeah.  But that's what they're going for.  And then I can't get past the fact that the guy behind the register is the guy that had the eggs in his mouth in Clerks. 
[02:31:30]  Steve's anything.  He was the guy that was putting the eggs in his mouth and he had a couple of other shots.  But it's like, you can't.  Kevin Smith will be in next week.  Yes.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  What's he plugging?  New book.  All right.  But even, no, even, I wasn't saying anything bad because even Kevin will admit that that is hardcore, geeky comic book guys in there.  People who love comics.  They know everything about comic books and, uh, you know, just some of the shit they know what, what issues and what's in it and what was the first one that where this one appeared. 
[02:32:00]  I was like that.  I have no fucking clue.  You know, back in the, in the day, like 91 to like 93, let's call it.  Like when, you know, anybody who's my age had Marvel cards and fucking holograms and getting a comic, getting, picking up not only a comic, but like $50 worth of comics at a time.  Yeah.  Like that's what it was back then.  I was never into that.  I got, my uncle turned me on to Fangora magazines.  Oh, those were awesome.  Yeah.  And they always, they smelt like a mildewed basement and, and the pictures in them were really gross and shit. 
[02:32:30]  They had like monster horror stuff.  It's like inside horror movies and like behind the scenes shit.  That was, that was fucking cool.  It's like, oh, the Loch Ness Monster.  Fangora is classic.  It's a creature from the Black Lagoon.  Oh, look at that.  It's the Wolfman.  Like you can't get mad at people for not knowing how a movie turns out because they didn't read the book.  No, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  But as far as Walking Dead goes, it's like, it's like, uh, it's like going to see Titanic and being surprised at the end. 
[02:33:00]  No, you're completely wrong.  Because The Walking Dead isn't a historical document.  It's a fucking, it's a fucking story about zombies.  What do you think is going to happen?  Yeah.  But you're saying like, oh my God, like, I can't believe you're shocked that so-and-so died.  It was in the comic book.  But like millions and millions of people are watching The Walking Dead that have never read the comic book.  And that's a great thing.  Yeah.  Most of them don't even know it is a comic book.  Yeah, you can't be surprised that everyone hasn't read something that you've read.  And I'm glad I don't know what's going to happen.  At the same time, if this was 2007 and everybody's talking about Lost and I don't know Lost, you're looking at me like I'm an asshole. 
[02:33:30]  No, I'm not because you don't watch it and it wasn't a comic book.  I'm saying, all I'm saying is that Walking Dead is huge.  It's huge, it's huge, it's huge.  And I think there's way more people out there that read the books.  Like, I honestly believe that there's way more people that read it that you actually think.  Way more fucking people have read those books.  They've been out since 2004.  No, no, no, I'm not doubting that people haven't read the books.  I'm saying that your assumption or expectation that everyone who is watching the show should have read the books is incredible. 
[02:34:00]  No, no, I understand we're both saying different things.  I understand what you're saying, but I understand what I'm saying, too, is that the TV show is big now, yes,  but the comics and the actual story has been big for a while.  And a lot of people know the complete story.  And it's not out of line to think that other people who haven't watched the show might know of some story arcs.  Right, it's not ridiculous to think so.  When this happened in the comic, it wasn't.  It was in a different way.  It was a different thing.  And it wasn't a pop culture sort of event.  Yeah.  Whereas when it happened on the TV show, it is. 
[02:34:30]  A pop culture event?  Yeah, not like a huge.  This is a huge show.  I think you're really underestimating it.  It's in the public conscious.  I guess I must be.  It was in the comic book conscious.  Sorry, guys.  It's in the public conscious.  Someone back me up.  I think more people.  Someone's trying to take a phone call.  Are watching the show.  No one's calling in your defense.  I think more people are watching the show than read the books.  I think so, too.  I think so.  Yeah, for sure.  Maybe.  I don't know, man.  Honestly, I don't know.  I don't know numbers.  Everything I'm saying is without any research. 
[02:35:00]  Those books have been reprinted four and five times.  Millions of copies.  Millions of copies.  I'm not doubting that.  I'm just saying that your expectations of other people are too high.  No, I'm not.  I just think that it's a big enough thing.  Like, for instance, I've never watched one episode of Lost, but I could probably name  most of the characters.  And I think that Walking Dead, it became such a huge thing.  No.  Before the TV show.  No, it didn't.  No.  If you were like, hey, dude, you know The Walking Dead? 
[02:35:30]  I'd say, yeah.  It's that graphic novel.  You'd say, can you name a character?  I'd say, no, I can't.  You can't.  Right.  Okay.  But that doesn't mean that there aren't millions of people who can.  Right.  And that's my point.  The TV show is bigger than Walking Dead.  I'm not arguing that either.  That's not a point I'm trying to make.  I'm just saying, you know what, fuck everybody.  Let's go to break.  Everybody can eat shit and die.  That's how every geek argument ends.  Fuck you.  No, my coach.  I just said, we're arguing a point that I don't think is that crazy.  Like, it's just not that crazy.  Like, for someone to know of some story arcs of Walking Dead is not considerably out of line. 
[02:36:00]  I don't think it's crazy.  I think it would wreck it.  I wouldn't read it now that I'm into the show because I don't want to know what's going  to happen.  Yeah.  And I'm glad I didn't read any because, you know, then I would kind of be like, oh, this  is the part when this happens instead of just.  Willy Wonka was a book before it was a movie.  I don't think everybody knew that he went up in the great class elevator.  You know what?  Take a big dick in your mouth, Dr. Gay.  He would, too.  He would.  Take your liberal ass out of the fucking hand.  That has nothing to do with zombies.  Now I'm going to look up fucking how much viewership. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, he needs numbers.  Versus.  He needs numbers.  You know why?  Because he knows he's got a weak argument.  I don't have a weak argument.  Oh, shit.  I don't find it to be weak whatsoever.  Dr. Gay is throwing some shit now.  It's not a weak argument.  He's throwing some haymakers.  Hacking some shit, too.  No, it's like, all three of you guys are watching the show and didn't read the books,  so you're going to take that side.  I'm the guy who doesn't watch the show and read the books, so I'm going to take that  side.  We're going to fucking jerk each other off all day.  All right.  I'm not doing this.  Okay.  Let's take a break.  Let's take a fucking break.  All right.  Finally.  All right.  He rocks.  Thanks.  Thanks. 
[02:37:00]  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest  We Couldn't Get.  Star of film and television, Robin Hood star, Christian Slater. 
[02:37:30]  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Christian Slater.  Christian, do you watch Top Chef?  No.  Thank you so much for your time.  My pleasure.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get on  the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Anthony Show, my fucking show.  We're going to talk about racism and guns.  Racism and guns are my fucking show.  So don't even bother trying to call in motherfuckers, because Anthony don't take no fucking phone 
[02:38:00]  calls.  Man.  Righteous.  Righteous.  How we doing, everybody?  Did you guys work out the numbers on that Walking Dead book versus television show?  Danny insists more people probably have read the books.  We're at an argument.  Well, here's the thing.  It's that I watched the first season of Walking Dead, and I thought I didn't care for it too  much.  It was slow, and I didn't care to tune in for a second season.  Okay.  Everybody seems to be all in on this new season. 
[02:38:30]  Well, I'm liking it.  But my mindset is still all about that first season that I had saw, which wasn't that great.  So I don't understand why people are talking so much shit about it.  That's my thing.  Okay.  So now Sam and Chavez can't wait to fucking shit on me about what I said, because I said  that Walking Dead was getting pretty big.  It was pretty big before.  Yeah.  And so now keeping in mind that my mindset is still first season mindset, where it says  here that fucking season one ratings were going 391,000 viewers.  That's what we're talking about here.  So, you know, to go from something like that to... 
[02:39:00]  That's Starz's new drama, Boss.  Oh, man.  Boss is not as big a show.  You know what?  I don't even want to argue this anymore.  Plus, I think the argument was that Danny had implied that a certain...  Can we spoil the thing now?  Well, not yet.  He's coming in in 10 minutes.  I don't want to spoil it.  No one wants to hear this anymore.  The argument was that I think that some people...  I didn't say everyone should know.  I said some people should know about a major story arc.  The thing that happened on the show... 
[02:39:30]  It happened very early on in the books, and I thought that it would be something that  people would know.  What if the numbers on Lost, what if the hatch, what if they drag that out until season seven?  Lost wasn't a comic book.  Can I...  It was after.  I didn't bring it up after the break, motherfuckers.  You guys did.  Can I just use this opportunity to reiterate how bad the phones are?  Can we go to Steve on line five?  He says, I got numbers on The Walking Dead.  By the way, this is the first phone call Friday and Monday.  No phone calls.  Three days. 
[02:40:00]  Exactly.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Is it potted up?  Yeah, the button's pushed.  Are you there, Steve?  Everyone say hello.  Everyone on the phone, say hi.  See what happens?  See?  Can you take line one just to make sure the phone's working?  Yeah, yeah, make sure they work.  Go ahead.  Hey, Bob in Texas.  Hi, Sam.  Yep, the phone's working.  Sam.  Hey, I'd like to thank Danny for turning me on to the Walking Dead comic book series. 
[02:40:30]  Geez, I didn't even know there was a comic book series.  All that guy that used to read comics and all that happy horse shit, you know?  Thanks, Danny.  I'm educated now.  No problem.  What city are you headed to?  Fucking nowhere.  Marble Falls, Texas.  Exactly.  There you go.  Have a good one, sir.  Oh, what's wrong with Marble Falls?  Damn, man.  It's just I don't think that many people knew.  Guy was saying thanks.  I didn't think that many people knew what was going to happen on this show.  Danny doesn't know how to take a compliment to thank you.  No, he doesn't. 
[02:41:00]  No, the guy was saying something nice.  Yeah.  Danny had to be all mean about it.  It's a big show.  I can't even say something nice without Danny just jumping down his throat.  Well, he's all pissed because Travis thinks this show is so great.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we do have Jon Brunthal coming in.  Yeah.  At 9.35.  The guy from the comic?  You know the guy that dies in issue six?  That guy?  You know that guy that they stretch it out for ratings?  That guy that's supposed to die in the sixth fucking issue? 
[02:41:30]  What if the last few people who hadn't read the comic book were going to read it?  So what?  Now it's ruined forever!  It's ruined!  What if they didn't get to issue six?  Yeah.  Well, they didn't really give that serious chance because if you bailed out before the  sixth issue, you're really a cock.  Yeah, well, Shane dies.  He died this past episode.  Well, that's been made quite clear.  He's dead.  He's off the show.  You know how I knew that?  You watched it?  No, comics.  The comics? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Issue six, motherfucker!  Yeah!  Okay.  He turned into a zombie, too.  What?  Yeah.  Strongly alleged to think.  Man, I thought that was going to go down differently.  He read the...  Dan is a comic snob.  I'm not a comic snob!  You're fucking...  It's zombies over and over again.  What do you think?  Oh, this guy...  Oh, man, I can't believe this guy got bit!  Yeah, but he wasn't bit.  He wasn't bit, though.  See?  Oh!  See?  And then he turned into a zombie. 
[02:42:30]  Oh!  Did you know he wasn't going to get bit?  No, because I read the books.  Oh.  Did he get bit in a book?  I don't remember.  It was a while ago.  Who remembers comic books?  I guess it really wasn't that big of a deal.  It was just a comic book.  It wasn't a show.  Shit.  Nobody reads comic books.  What's wrong with you?  Who reads those fucking things?  Oh, my God.  I wanted to get to the Whitney Houston thing before our guest comes in.  Why don't we...  Bobby Christina.  I'll go find out about our guest.  I have to duck down to look underneath that black strip of tape down the hallway to see 
[02:43:00]  if any guests are here.  I was walking in here before and I was like, oh, there's a nice bunch of people with no  heads.  Yeah, very convenient.  Yeah, so Whitney Houston's daughter.  Bobby Christina.  Who is fucking really ugly.  She did not get that young Whitney look that everybody adored so much.  She was speaking with Oprah.  Yes, she was.  Oprah got to do the big Houston family interview.  She was at the house and she interviewed, I don't know, Cece and... 
[02:43:30]  Cece's the mom?  I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But she got a few minutes to...  Cece DeVille?  No, of course not.  With Bobby Christina.  Bobby Christina.  Yeah.  And did they ask her about any of the drug allegations?  No.  Softballs.  Softballs.  They really gave her...  Why wouldn't they ask her about drugs?  No, no drugs.  That's probably like, well, Oprah, if you want to come in and do interviews, you ain't  going to be talking to Bobby Christine about no drugs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And no, Oprah decided to stick to Oprah. 
[02:44:00]  Stick to more of the spiritual side of things.  Spiritual side.  At which point, Bobby Christina said that she's not...  You know, she's felt Whitney's spirit pass through her.  Okay.  I'm just looking at a horribly racist name somebody has for Bobby Christina.  I thought that might be what you were doing.  Yeah, yeah.  Very funny.  Yeah, let's hear some of Oprah and Bobby Christina.  Have you had the visitation?  I know some people might think we're crazy, but a lot of people... 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  ...get where they actually come to you in your dreams.  Doing acid.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And especially throughout the house.  Throughout the house, you know, lights, you know, turn on and off.  And I'm like, Mom, how are you doing?  You know?  Really?  Yeah.  You know, we still, like...  I can still sit there and I can still laugh with her.  You know?  I can still sit there and I can still talk to her.  Wow.  She sounds fucked up.  Yeah.  Like, I know a lot of people that have been fucked up and they sounded like that. 
[02:45:00]  You know?  I don't know if she is, but to me and my personal opinion, based on listening to fucked up people  talk, that sounds fucked up on some type of...  And the content of what she was saying.  Yeah.  That content is very fucked up.  She's laughing.  What?  Whitney's just walking around the house?  Turning lights on and off.  It's like...  Now, why isn't that on fucking TV?  Why is the fucking sweetie pie on?  They should have... 
[02:45:30]  Bobby Christina.  Bobby Christina and Whitney as a ghost walking around the house like an updated ghost in  Mrs. Muir.  And the lights turn on and off and Bobby Christina is just like, oh, ha ha, Mom.  And she's laughing with Mom and shit.  That's a good one, Whitney.  That's good.  And Ofra can come in every so often and talk with Whitney about what happened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About bathtubs and gravy boats or whatever was in there.  What happened with Davy Jones?  Did they put him on the ground?  I think so. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  How come no big tribute like Whitney got?  Well, Davy Jones was not on Whitney Houston.  I mean, I know you have asserted that Davy Jones was more important in music than Whitney  Houston.  Well, I think most people would disagree.  If you read the Monkees comic books, you would know that they were a lot bigger than the  show.  And all right.  No, I would think that the Monkees were probably bigger than Whitney Houston.  I don't think that's the case.  I think that's a huge leap you're making.  Really? 
[02:46:30]  Huge.  Also, I mean, the Monkees were like a...  Yeah, they had hits, but they were a TV show band.  Yeah.  TV.  And that's when TV, you know, didn't have a lot of the channels.  So a lot more people watched.  Yeah.  One show at a time back then.  You didn't watch fucking five shows on 10,000 channels.  No, that's true.  But I mean, Whitney Houston came along when music videos were just starting to get big.  Yeah.  You know, she did I Will Always Love You, which is, I mean...  They did Daydream Believer.  Crazy number. 
[02:47:00]  Last Train to Clarksville.  I think Whitney is probably...  Valerie.  Her songs have grossed more than the Monkees.  Yeah.  She's got probably bigger hits than the Monkees.  Wow.  She's probably also influenced more people than the Monkees.  No way.  You don't think so?  The Monkees, I think, had a huge influence on a lot of musicians.  Like who?  Growing up.  I don't know.  Probably everybody that grew up in the 70s and 80s listened to Monkees songs, learned  a Monkees song.  Well, how come American Idol doesn't do Monkees Day? 
[02:47:30]  I thought they did.  No?  They did Whitney for the girls last week.  Well, they should do a Monkees Day.  Because it's like, you know, it's a TV...  It's like the California Dreams.  It's a TV band.  I don't know.  Private Funeral held for Davy Jones.  Oh, they didn't go public, huh?  No.  They didn't even invite the other Monkees.  What?  Why?  Maybe a problem with Mike Nesmith.  I don't know.  Did they cremate him?  Look how fun this banner is for Capital One Bank where you can high-five Jerry Stiller.  Isn't that killer? 
[02:48:00]  I could do this all day.  That's a good one.  Look at that.  You've earned five times the interest.  Nice.  High-five.  I'm sorry.  I just derailed everything.  No, that's a great one.  It was worthwhile.  Watch this.  Watch.  Boom.  Oh, yeah.  High-five.  Yeah, no.  They didn't invite the other monkey band members to the funeral.  That's a...  It says family members, wife, daughters.  That's a small job.  Even Marsha Brady was not there.  Who was a big fan.  Yeah.  Huge fan.  When she was hot.  Due to the family's request to keep the service very private, the band would wait until a 
[02:48:30]  public memorial to pay their respects.  When is that?  How long are they stringing this thing along?  I don't know.  No.  Don't know.  Don't say.  Oh, well.  Anyway, I think...  Like, I don't think the monkeys...  Bigger influence.  I don't think there would be any question about whether or not the monkeys would do something  in a stadium, in a sports arena, the way Whitney Houston might.  She didn't, but there was talk of her doing that.  I think the monkeys could sell out a big arena back in the day. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, but what...  Today, if Davy Jones died...  What if it was a comic book first?  Right, right.  The monkeys comics.  If Davy Jones died today, or, you know, last week or whatever it was, you think that his  funeral could be held in a stadium?  In an arena?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Maybe like a rec center, or like a, you know...  I don't think so either.  BFW hall.  Any more Ofra?  And, um...  No, I mean, the rest of it was just Oprah talking to her about her spirituality and her 
[02:49:30]  dreams, and Whitney, you know...  Yeah.  Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  Yeah.  I hear we also have some type of perp walk.  Yeah, it's just something Danny found.  Yeah, some...  No, I think it was a Travis finder.  Oh, shit.  You guys passing the buck.  That ain't good.  That's not a good sign.  No, I just get credit where credit's due.  I don't want to take credit for a good pull.  All right.  Dr. Gay will always have a good pull.  A good pull, and take credit for it.  Oh, yeah.  Mouth pull.  Well, I guess this was a...  I thought that was implied. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, I know.  This was a perp walk.  Somebody was...  Yeah, and he was getting interviewed.  During the perp walk, where most perps don't like to talk.  And he decided...  Walk the walk without talking.  Someone like to hide their face.  Yeah.  Yeah, they hide their face, which is silly.  They end up in the newspaper anyway.  Even David Berkowitz didn't do anything, and he was a huge perp.  Yeah.  But this guy decided to cut a wrestling promo, apparently.  All right.  It was a bizarre scene when our Courtney Brennan tried to talk to the man accused of assaulting  three people, including his own mother, with a mantel clock. 
[02:50:30]  How about...  Well, you know something mean, Gene.  The punk girl's scared, brother.  Yeah, that was...  See, now...  The clip would be spectacular.  Yeah, yeah.  If it went on a little longer.  If he kept going with it.  But the guy had nothing.  When Danny described it to me, he said...  It was like he started...  He was like, you know something mean, Gene.  And it was...  I thought Danny was saying that he was speaking in a tone as if he was talking to mean Gene.  Right.  Not literally saying, well, you know something mean, Gene.  That's what I thought, too. 
[02:51:00]  I thought he was just going to sound like a guy that would have been cutting a wrestling  promo, not doing actual lines.  Well, I literally said, he says, you know what...  You know what, mean Gene.  Yeah.  I want a loony.  You want to hear it again?  He's a lunatic.  Yeah, let me hear that one more time.  Well, you know something mean, Gene.  Hulk Hogan here, brother.  You call him brother, too.  Hulk Hogan here, brother.  Today, we're referencing Hulk Hogan.  He faces assault charges after he alleged attack at a home in North Huntington last week. 
[02:51:30]  Well, today in court, we also got a look at the bruises on the alleged victims.  Here you can see one man has a black eye.  Today's hearing was delayed.  I guess it was delayed because he was cutting promos.  That's great.  I got to put the asses in the seats.  I just really wish that he had a little more prepared.  Yeah, he should have.  I mean, that could have been a viral clip if he just laid in solid for like 30 seconds.  Even a quick train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins, something.  Yeah, he needed to close it out.  I mean... 
[02:52:00]  High energy.  The quick mean Gene reference brought everybody in so we knew what he was doing.  Yeah, he had us.  But, uh...  He had us and wasn't able to close the deal.  He needed a little more.  Some reference to a sex tape, even.  Something.  That would have been good, too.  What did he do?  He assaulted his mother?  What?  With a mantle clock.  With a mantle clock?  That was one of the big things that overshadows the entire story.  He was arrested on assault charges for injuring two people and his mother with a mantle clock.  A mantle clock.  That shit is awesome.  That's like old Clue style of hurting people. 
[02:52:30]  It was Hulk Hogan in the parking lot with the mantle clock.  Yeah, with the mantle clock.  How do you do that to like your mom?  I don't know.  Or your grandma.  What a great thing to whack someone in the face with.  That is a good fucking weapon.  An old school mantle clock.  Who has one of those, anyway?  Ugh, man.  Mantle clock.  Yeah, well, this guy had one.  But when you get to hitting your mom or grandma, I hear these guys knife their grandma for money  for crack, and then you smoke it, and you're done, and you're sitting there just going, 
[02:53:00]  Ah, I smoked all my crack, and now my grandma's dead.  Isn't there just like a moment where there's eye contact where you're like,  Oh, shit, this is my grandma.  I can't do this.  My mother or something.  Yeah, that's a...  That crack fucks you up.  That's a total lack of ability to have any type of emotion whatsoever.  You're just...  Yeah.  You're cut off from the human race at that point.  Look at this headline.  Man accused of assaulting three with mantle clock references Hulk Hogan. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  And that's why Hulk Hogan doesn't have any trouble getting laid.  He's so famous that the fact that somebody referenced him is the bigger story.  It's in the story.  Even curbs are calling out his name.  The print...  This particular print story is hysterical.  Channel 11's Courtney Brennan tried to talk with O'Donnell after the hearing, but only  referenced Hulk Hogan.  Quote,  How about, comma,  Well, you know what, Mean Gene?  Hulk Hogan's here, brother.  O'Donnell said.  That's just silly to read. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  You think Hulk Hogan was, like, embarrassed by it, or is he like, yeah, brother, that's  kind of cool.  A mention.  You know, with this whole sex tape thing, we should get in touch with him and only talk  about this kid.  Yeah.  And the mantle clock.  Have you ever hit anybody with a mantle clock?  Would you consider...  No.  Is it more devastating than Mr. Fuji's salt in the eyes?  That's a finishing move.  Yeah.  He does the mantle clock.  I think Hogan probably checked his Google alerts.  Yeah.  Saw his name in the news, and... 
[02:54:30]  What do you think are on Hulk Hogan's Google alerts?  Like, Hulk Hogan, Hulkster.  Hulkster, yeah.  Vince.  Vince McMahon.  Sex tape now.  Sex tape.  Warrior.  He doesn't like that.  Linda Hogan.  Linda Hogan, gay.  Macho man.  He took that one off.  Yeah.  May he rest in peace.  He's got Bruce DeBart Beefcake up there, just in case some new hot picks come up.  Well, what if there's some more nude picks leaked to TMZ?  Nude. 
[02:55:00]  You think TMZ would run with that if they got leaked nude Brutus the Barber Beefcake photos?  Who wants to see that shit?  I always liked him best as the disciple.  Yeah.  Jake the Snake.  Where's Jake the Snake?  Is he dead?  No, he's not dead.  Wow.  Somehow he's not dead.  He held in there?  Yeah.  I've heard he's going to start a wrestling school.  No.  Because the one guy you want to learn from is Jake the Snake Roberts.  That drunk.  Born and drunk.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  Doing all kinds of substances.  Lots of wild accusations running around there about Jake the Snake Roberts and his substances.  Running wild.  Yeah.  How are we doing on our guest?  We should be here.  Travis went out to check on it, but I can't see outside the studio.  This fucking black tape around here is disgusting me.  Yeah.  It's like just having...  It looks like we're in a race car.  It's like we broadcast out of a Honda. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of like that.  It's got...  Yeah.  And we got Chin Cook stickers on the fucking...  It's positioned perfectly, so it's just blacking out someone's eyes.  Yeah.  Here comes Travis.  Travis is...  Taking his sweet ass time.  Hi, Travis.  He's looking underneath the black tape.  Travis, where is our guest?  Oh, boy.  Because this is the time he's supposed to be in here actually sitting down.  Yeah, Roland's waiting for him.  He'll be here.  He's got a time for us to be here.  Roland's waiting for him.  You can read that.  What is this?  Oh, this whole thing. 
[02:56:30]  Yes, that you wanted to do.  Well, I didn't ever want to do anything.  I just mentioned yes.  I said yes.  You came up with a name for it.  I was just saying brackets, brackets, brackets.  Yeah.  Everybody during March with this March Madness only talks about the brackets.  I saw a big commercial, big fucking graphic-y thing for college basketball.  March Madness.  Everyone is so into this, and I can't understand how anybody can be so into college basketball  and know everything about it. 
[02:57:00]  But they seem to.  Sign up now.  Sign up now to compete against the hosts and staff of this, the Opie and Anthony channel.  The whole channel, huh?  For a chance to win.  Ron and Fez.  You guys.  Oh, it's everybody.  Oh, Ron and Fez are in on this?  Yeah.  Now, they do know their things.  I've heard them talk about it over the years, and they do know the schools, and who's better?  I don't know how.  Well, go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony for information on how to sign up. 
[02:57:30]  Join our league and fill out your brackets, brackets, brackets.  Fill them out.  That's where you pit teams against each other, and then one wins, and then goes to the next bracket.  You don't pit them against each other.  They've already been pitted.  Well, they've been so pitted.  So pitted.  All right, yeah, fill out your bracket.  You just have to choose who's the winner. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  You know, obviously you're not just selecting who's going to play who.  I think I knew that.  I didn't know.  All right.  Well, maybe I didn't know that.  The password when you enter our league is ROPERS.  ROPERS.  And if someone was on the board?  Oh, well.  No, that board's empty.  There's nobody there.  Is he taking a shit?  No, in Eric's defense, I did ask for some water.  Here he comes.  How you doing, Eric?  Look at that look of horror on his face. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, jeez.  And he comes on and it goes off.  You son.  It's fucking the worst.  Fucking sucks.  Oh, Paul.  Just stop coming in.  Yes.  SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  The password is ROPERS.  ROPERS.  No, Eric's not ready for it.  And now all I see is Eric mouthing the words, shit.  That's what he wants to make.  Deadline to sign up and fill out your bracket, bracket, bracket is tip-off of the first game on Thursday. 
[02:59:00]  You could fill this out right up until they play?  I guess so.  I guess that's how this company handles their bracket league, which is great.  That's risky.  The thing is, most of my brackets are already filled out.  Brackets, brackets.  But you have mine out.  I can't fill out the rest of my brackets because today is the big Iona-BYU game to find out who gets that spot.  It's the play-in game.  Who? 
[02:59:30]  Iona.  Yeah.  Iona College, New York, represent.  Right.  Versus.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  BYU, which is Brigham Young, whatever this is.  Brigham Young.  Brigham Young.  Did you say Brigham Young?  I don't know what that is.  I like that.  If Iona wins, I have them going quite far in the tournament.  Oh, you do?  But if BYU wins, they're not getting past Murray.  Then you're out.  They're not going past Murray State, so I'm not going to fill that bracket out.  See, I don't even know how the brackets work as far as if one team of yours loses, are you done? 
[03:00:00]  Well, no.  You just, I mean.  Points.  Yeah, let's say you think Kansas is going to lose in the first round.  Kansas plays?  Yeah.  They're one of the best teams.  I don't know that.  So they say.  Are you supposed to?  I know.  You're supposed to know it.  March Madness Brackets.  Well, see, this is why it's going to be fun when you and Jim fill out your own brackets.  Oh, where are the retards?  Where are the assholes that don't know shit?  You are the fucking man, right?  I have no idea about college basketball.  See?  I have no clue.  I'm a sports guy.  That's why I did pro.  I believe I'll win. 
[03:00:30]  I think I'm going to do quite well.  I don't think so.  That's the thing about these brackets is that you could win.  Anthony, do you know how many people we have in our league right now?  How many?  9,000.  What?  Yes.  How'd that happen?  Because people like brackets.  How many people really want to play with Ron and Fez?  Yeah, exactly.  What's the price?  $1,000.  $1,000.  So if Iona goes all the way, I get $1,000?  Yes.  If Iona, yes.  What college?  Iona college.  I'll tell you what.  Is that out of the realm of possibility?  It's so out of the realm of possibility that even though Sam's not eligible for the $1,000, 
[03:01:00]  if Iona goes all the way, I will give him $1,000.  You heard it.  Mark it, Eric.  Mark it.  Because Iona is going all the way.  You heard it.  Mark it.  If Iona wins the NCAA championship, not today's game, the entire thing.  No, the championship.  This could happen.  $1,000.  Why can't this happen?  Because it would be like Sam winning the NCAA championship.  Iona is in one of the games.  The only difference is that Iona gets a play-in game.  What's that?  That means that you get to play-in to face Murray State.  Qualifier.  Yeah, qualifier.  No, no, no.  Murray State, they would play in the second round. 
[03:01:30]  Murray State?  Where's that from?  Murray, Kentucky.  Holy shit.  I have Murray going pretty far, too.  Well, you're from Kentucky.  Murray.  Okay, Murray.  It's Michigan State.  Never heard of these schools.  Michigan State, Murray State.  You didn't go to any of them.  Syracuse.  Yeah.  Let's see where it gets.  And Iona.  What are you on there?  No, no, no, no.  I'm talking about Iona College.  He said it.  You must be rich.  I told you not to do that.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he walked right into it. 
[03:02:00]  Brackets, brackets, brackets.  Yeah, deadline to sign up for this and fill out your bracket is tip-off on the first game  on Thursday.  I think that's around like 6 p.m.  Is it?  I don't know.  You've got to be 18 or older.  I'm sorry, kids.  Complete rules are at SiriusXM.com slash hoops.  But you don't go there to sign up.  You go to SiriusXM.com slash opiananthony.  Yeah, but you're just going to be redirected to slash hoops.  Oh, God.  Then why didn't they just say slash hoops?  Oh, whatever.  Because we like to see how many hits we get, even though they won't tell us. 
[03:02:30]  How am I supposed to do this?  What's your team name going to be?  Team name?  Yeah, you've got to have a team name.  Wait a minute.  Like mine, so that the listeners know it's me, is Dr. Gay.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  I get this bracket, right?  And then I choose the teams I think are going to win.  Yeah.  For all these games.  That's right.  And then people sign up to be on my, like...  No.  How does this work?  People sign up and fill out their own brackets, and then you get a certain amount of points 
[03:03:00]  for each team that you get.  Let me see if I can help.  What?  Let me see if I can help.  Have you ever been in a football pool where you just, where you pick the teams that win?  No.  But you know the concept of picking teams that win?  All you do is pick the teams that you think are going to win.  You're aware that there are two teams, and one of them will win.  You know, but why do I need a team name, then?  For fun.  Because, yeah, just for fun.  Your team is just you.  Oh, but team is just me.  Nobody else.  Your name could be Anthony.  See, you made it sound like I had to pick a team name because listeners, when they sign 
[03:03:30]  up, can sign up under my team for some reason.  But all the listeners are ranked according to who's got the most points so far, so, you  know, Dr. Gay will be in, you know, 50th place, and Sam Roberts will be, you know, in  25th place.  You just need a name.  Eric, have you still filled out your brackets yet?  What should I call it?  No, I had no idea that I could even go and do it yet.  Yeah, we were talking about it.  Are you going to?  I guess so.  Yeah.  What's your team name going to be?  I have no idea.  Just going to make it something, um...  Make it something fun.  Fun? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Just going to make it something.  The foods.  No, I don't think...  No?  The food?  Ooh, for what, Eric?  Yeah.  Calories.  The sex man sports.  Yeah, calories.  The eatings.  Calories.  The New York calories.  What would be the New Jersey?  No, no, no.  It would be the Florida.  Oh, yeah.  Florida.  The Florida calories.  The Tampa Bay calories.  No, uh, West Palm.  Snackets.  The West Palm pretty cool hugs.  The West Palm snackets.  No, it's easy.  It's the West Palm Beach motorboats.  Motorboats.  Pretty cool, huh? 
[03:04:30]  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what's your team name?  I don't know.  I'm trying to think of, uh, maybe something, um, what, what, what relates to me?  The drunks?  No?  No.  How about, how about the Anthony Cumia pedophiles?  Ah, that's a great one.  The pedophiles.  I don't think I, I don't think I like that very much.  Oh.  It could imply something.  What's the, what's the gun of the Second Amendment?  The third, what's the gun of the Second Amendment?  You should call yourself the Second Amendment. 
[03:05:00]  The Second Amendments.  Yeah.  It's because it sounds like a 50s group.  And pedophiles.  And pedophiles.  The Second Amendments.  They touch kids.  I think that.  They touch kids with guns.  Yeah.  And the kid touches.  Put rifle barrels up their little buttholes.  It is, it is funny that you, uh, know how to, like, how planes fly and how to launch rockets  and all this stuff, but a March Madness tournament bracket is beyond you.  It's beyond my whole thing. 
[03:05:30]  I, I've never been into anything like this, uh, so I don't know.  Um.  It's really easy.  We'll do it on the air, like, tomorrow or Thursday.  Ten Knockers.  The Fourth Reich.  Uh, a lot of names coming in now.  The Black Devils.  Teen, no.  Bunghole Bandits.  Shut up.  Okay.  Well, there's.  Sounds like watch badness or something.  Ah!  Oh, fake chip.  How about your teen name could be called the White Man's Burden? 
[03:06:00]  White Man's Burden?  Yeah.  Ah.  The Spaghetti Walls.  That would be great.  What?  I hear that too.  What?  Exactly.  Eric said that Roland said.  Yeah.  That he's coming up in the elevator right now.  Oh!  There's Roland.  Hey, Roland.  Come on in for a sec.  There's Roland.  He can't hear.  Can he?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Roland.  Roland, what's the, uh, status of our guest?  He's coming right now.  Because we're, uh, look at us now.  Now we're kind of, uh.  We're just sitting here talking about basketball. 
[03:06:30]  And if you think for a second, I'm staying here past him.  Oh, I know.  And this.  And does everybody enjoy how Roland, now that, uh, now that Lynn isn't winning games for the Knicks,  has fucking switched to his New York Yankees shirt.  Yeah, Yankee.  Ooh.  I don't need the, yeah.  I'm good.  And this show was very, was kept on a very tight schedule today.  So it's a little off-putting that now we're ten minutes behind.  It really was.  Ooh, that would answer that.  Yeah, that was.  Don't take out, don't take out your.  Roland just threw a Sharpie.  I can think of one of those big ones.  Don't take out your Danny anger on me. 
[03:07:00]  You've taken out your Opie and Anthony anger on me before.  Don't take out your Danny anger.  Is this them?  Danny anger.  Because I can't tell.  He's mad at Danny.  I'm busting on him.  I can't tell.  He's mad at Danny for the shirt stuff because Danny was doing it during the break, too.  All right.  Here they come.  That's good.  Can we get up?  Oh, man.  There he is.  John, come on in.  How are you guys?  How are you doing?  Take a seat.  What's going on, man, John?  Look at him.  That's the guy.  How are you doing, guys?  How are you doing, man?  How are you doing?  Nice to meet you, Anthony.  Nice to meet you, Anthony.  Nice to meet you, Anthony.  Nice to meet you, Anthony.  Big fan.  Big fan.  Sam.  John Bernthal.  Bernthal?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, that's it. 
[03:07:30]  Cool, man.  Yeah, that's our young Sam Roberts back there.  How you doing?  Yeah, you don't have to pay attention to him.  Wow.  Yeah.  Get his headphones working.  I've been watching the show.  Yeah.  I love it.  Thank you, man.  And wow, what a past couple of episodes, even, you know?  Yeah.  The last one was an amazing, with shows like that, I call it a holy shit moment.  Holy shit.  We just sit there and go, holy shit.  Yeah.  I mean, Travis, I tweeted like, what the fuck was that? 
[03:08:00]  Now, last week, Dale bought it.  He did.  He bought it.  And much to a lot of people I was talking to, much to their pleasure.  Is that right?  Dale was not a liked character.  You got to not like Dale, man.  Dale's great.  You know what?  In that whole atmosphere of what's going on in the world at that point, I love a little  voice of, let's keep civilization together a little bit and stuff.  But, boy, was he sanctimonious in some of his speeches. 
[03:08:30]  I think it's very funny as far as fans' reactions.  Because last year, I felt like everybody just hated me.  Because all I was doing was pining away for Laurie.  And then this year, I started killing a couple people and started losing my mind.  And I started headhunting for zombies and people started digging me.  So you're like, oh, this is great.  Cool.  Shane guy's cool.  Shane guy.  Yeah.  Shane's a badass is what went on.  Instead of, yeah, just trying to get back with the chick that wasn't yours in the first 
[03:09:00]  place.  That's it, man.  That's it.  And, yeah, now, the last episode, and if anybody didn't see it, sorry.  You should have watched it.  Yeah.  I've gotten to the point now where I'm just watching it live.  I was DVRing it.  But people are such insufferable pricks on Twitter and whatnot that you can't even, like,  the spoilers aren't even in the thing.  It's like fucking hashtag Shane's dead.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks, asshole.  I had to watch Sunday's episode because Dale's death was spoiled for me. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, it was.  Because everybody's talking about it on Twitter.  Is that right?  As it's happening, I'm like, well, you know, now I just got to watch just in case.  And thank God I did.  Yeah, I'm just such a fucking monkey on the computer.  I mean, I can barely make my hotmail work.  So I don't know.  I guess I can't really spoil it because I kind of know the deal.  But, yeah.  That's true.  But, yeah, I do know.  I've heard that there's a lot of spoilers out there.  Yeah, yeah.  I really enjoy doing that.  They're assholes, man.  It's like, I kind of want to watch the show.  But it wasn't spoiled for me that Shane was killed. 
[03:10:00]  It was a huge, unexpected thing.  And the way it happened was great.  I mean, obviously, between you two guys, that's what should have happened.  Right on.  And the knifing, pretty brutal.  Yeah.  Pretty brutal.  Yeah.  And now this whole zombie thing.  Yeah.  Now, that's a whole new mystery.  What do you think about that?  Entering that.  Well, Travis is suspecting that. 
[03:10:30]  I think I hold a popular theory.  Which is?  And that is?  Everyone's already infected.  Yeah, I think.  And then.  But how come that wasn't happening earlier?  Well, I've read that if you watch, they're very careful to show that only people that were  dead in, like, car crashes and stuff already had brain trauma.  So they wouldn't have come back after they were killed.  Holy shit.  That's some intricate stuff.  Badass, man.  He's like, fucking, you know what?  Wow.  Yeah.  What show is this?  You're selling John on this.  Yeah.  Right, huh?  Well, look.  I mean, after shows like Lost, people really pay attention to a lot of things. 
[03:11:00]  And so I think, like, you know, showrunners and writers have to be really careful with  if they've got a plan, you better be covering all your bases.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It was odd because that, what was the name of the kid that you guys picked up and put  in the barn?  Randall.  Yeah, Randall.  Yeah.  You took him out there and dispatched him.  Right.  Not knowing that he was going to turn.  Right, right, right.  Now, when I first saw him as a zombie, I assumed you somehow, you know, shoved some 
[03:11:30]  blood in him or some way to turn him.  I didn't, I had no idea at that point.  I was still a little confused as to why he was a zombie.  And then you start going, I'm just going to say, you know, I broke his neck here.  But you wouldn't have been able to do that because the cat was already out of the bag.  Right, right, right.  So that part got really confusing.  And then right after you got stabbed, I was like, ah, I don't give a shit about any of  that stuff.  And then coming back as a zombie.  Now, how was that?  I'll tell you what, that was... 
[03:12:00]  Was it fun for you?  You know, man, look, it was, I mean, I don't want to sound like a sap, but this was a tough  show to leave and it was a tough show to die on.  I mean, I love those people and especially with everything that sort of went down in the  season with losing Frank and all that.  It was just, you know, the group on the ground there, the cast and the crew, it's like a family.  So shooting that last scene was a very emotional kind of thing.  And, you know, we prepared for it for a long time and me and Andy did a lot of rewrites 
[03:12:30]  and we really tried to get that scene to be what it was.  But then when it was done, they were like, all right, man, we're going to make you up  like a zombie now and put some fucking contacts in your eyes.  And all of a sudden you got to go do a zombie walk.  And look, I'm pretty much a preparation whore when it comes to my acting.  I really try to carve stuff out.  And I realized now I got to go play a zombie.  I have no fucking idea how to play a zombie, you know.  And I was like, what do you do?  Like, you know.  The basic zombie thing.  Your arm's a little out. 
[03:13:00]  That's it.  And, you know, the crazy thing is I have a ton of respect for the people who play zombies  on the show.  You know, they're â€“ I do hate zombies.  I hate them and call me a douchey method actor.  But I hate when they're around me and stuff.  But the people that play them are great and they're great, you know, physical actors.  But, you know, you can't see anything when you have those contacts on.  All the contacts.  Yeah, like nothing at all.  So it's â€“ I got a lot of respect for what they're doing, you know.  Were you now â€“ were you familiar with the books? 
[03:13:30]  You know, I â€“  Because Danny, oh, boy, is he familiar with the books.  Is that right?  And I guess your character â€“  We were having a discussion earlier because obviously there was a big â€“ the big show.  There was a big event that happened.  And I knew about this event for some time.  So there was discussion about whether that event is cultural â€“ well, is it known beforehand?  If you're a fan of the series, would you might know it?  And I would say yes.  They say no.  We're all arguing.  I think if something's based on a book, a lot of times it's a fluid situation. 
[03:14:00]  Like a character does get popular.  Right.  And they change the whole story just so you could keep that character in the show.  I mean, I think they've been going really back and forth with this.  And that was sort of Frank's whole idea is to take this source material.  And it's a real credit to Robert Kirkman as well because he said, you know, take my source material.  And you can go off in tangents.  And you can do things a little bit differently.  And they sort of keep returning and keep going back.  And I think that's a really cool way to adapt source material because if it is just â€“ if we just sort of put the comic book on TV, you know, everyone's going to know exactly what's going to happen. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, there's no real surprises there.  And I guess in the book, your character got killed off earlier.  Super quick.  I mean, man, I got this job.  I wanted this job so bad.  And I fought for it so bad.  I'm like, oh, I'm going to go buy the comic.  I literally took one dump of sitting there on the shitter reading.  And by the time I was done, my dude's dead.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, yeah, man.  So I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  But I think it was really Frank's idea to say, you know, there's something there. 
[03:15:00]  There's something there between Rick and Shane and this relationship that we could sort of carve out.  And Kirkman says, you know, when he was writing it, you know, at that point he was just trying to sell a comic, you know.  And like he was just trying to get as much stuff down there.  And I think looking at what we've done, he's actually gone back and said, you know, I wish I had kept Shane around a little bit longer.  So, hey, man, I dug it.  You know, I'm glad that they did.  But you did know that an end was in your future on the show. 
[03:15:30]  Always.  That's got to be rough, though, like just for your â€“  It is, man.  You never know.  And look, you're doing a show called The Walking Dead, you know.  And I think it's funny because, I mean, there's just no job security on that show whatsoever.  And, you know, one of my first gigs was â€“ one of my first gigs that I ever did was I did this movie that nobody in the world has seen called Tony and Tina's Wedding.  And a lot of the guys from The Sopranos were on the show.  And they would say about how, like, you'd crack open a script and you never knew when it was going to be your last one. 
[03:16:00]  Open it slowly and wince.  That's it, dude.  You never knew when you're getting whacked.  And it's a similar situation on this.  And, again, not to sound like a douchey actor, but, you know, I think it adds to it.  I think the fact that you never know when you're going to go, it adds to the atmosphere.  For the viewers, it's amazing because when that happened to you last episode, it was like everybody on social media that I was reading was just like,  holy fuck, no way they did that.  They did not just â€“ like, even after you were stabbed and you're laying on the ground and you're kind of coughing up blood. 
[03:16:30]  Even then I'm kind of thinking, well, sucking chest wound.  And, ah, the doc could probably fix it up.  And then when you do that final, oh, and just kind of go over and the eyes glaze over, it's like, well, maybe he's not.  Yeah, you just don't want to think like â€“ because the character â€“ and you're right.  I found that the second you fucking clipped â€“ what's his name there? 
[03:17:00]  Otis.  Otis in the leg in order to get away.  Yeah.  Which I think there was part noble reason to save the kid.  Absolutely.  But also part, hey, I got to save my own ass here.  That's it, man.  And that was a great turn for the character where it started making you a badass, yeah, not just pining for the girl.  Right, right, right.  But you are going to start doing some really off-the-wall shit, yeah.  Yeah, and I think it adds to the whole world to sort of say â€“ you know, I think it kind of started in the season before when I beat that dude, Ed, by the side of the water, you know, after he laid his hands on Andrew. 
[03:17:30]  You know, I think, you know, the sort of discovery in that world that it is lawless and you can get away â€“ you know, you hit him a couple of times and you're like, you know what, this kind of feels good.  I'm just going to break your face in it.  Who do I really have to answer to?  And I think that that kind of feeling â€“ I think Shane's the first one.  He does the same thing when he puts his gun on Rick in the woods in season one. 
[03:18:00]  It's like â€“ it's this discovery of, you know, there really are no laws here if I want to take over.  And I think the kernel of that leads to I could actually kill Rick and take this position that I want because really who's going to stop me?  I mean, is Herschel going to stop me?  Yeah, you start realizing that there is no law.  There's no law.  There's nobody to answer to except the demons in your head.  But the really cool thing too is you and Shane and Rick start out in pretty much the same spot. 
[03:18:30]  You guys are cops.  You're partners together.  And then go in, you know, completely different directions through the story arc, which, you know, he's really trying to be a good guy and do the right thing.  Absolutely.  Even though some of his methods are a little off.  And he's one of these guys that's not this all-knowing hero.  Yeah.  A lot of times he's like, I don't know what the fuck to do.  I hope I'm making the right decision.  And your character, on the other hand, thought whatever decision you made was going to be the right one. 
[03:19:00]  The right one.  Yeah, I don't think there's good guys and bad guys in this show, man.  Everyone's trying to do what's right.  And I think all good characters sort of are like that.  I think if you try to play a hero or if you try to play a villain, I think you're really â€“ I don't think â€“ I think you're doing a disservice to the audience, man.  It works.  It works in a few shows.  And, again, bringing up Lost and stuff like that, there were people on that show that were, you know,  you're not quite sure.  Is that a good guy or a bad guy?  And I think it adds more â€“ you're able to relate to the character more, especially in that kind of situation. 
[03:19:30]  I think everybody's had the old zombie, what would you do if â€“  What would you do, yeah.  And it's â€“ yeah, it's one of those situations where you can't tell good, bad.  And everyone's not always going to like the good guy because, like you said, everybody was so sick of Dale.  And Dale is, you know, the good guy.  He was just the good guy.  And everyone's just staring at their TVs just saying, shut up, just kill the guy, you know.  And he's playing the good guy.  John, did you have any clue that Dale was so disliked?  I had no fucking idea until I walked into the studio, man. 
[03:20:00]  I'm like, I love him.  You should get on the internet.  Wow.  Yeah, like the interweb.  Man, did they not like Dale?  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit, man.  Yeah, go back to the RV and twist the spark plug and shut the fuck up.  That's amazing.  But, you know, he played that part perfectly.  Yeah.  He's got a reaction at everybody.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Tim Taman is the fucking man.  And I will say, you know, again, not to get too sappy, but on that last scene that Andy  Lincoln and I plays Rick that we shot, Jeff had been gone for a few weeks because he died 
[03:20:30]  in the episode before.  And he actually, he lives on a farm in upstate New York.  And he actually flew down to Georgia.  And he and the entire cast came out and stood by while we shot that scene all night long.  Oh, really?  It was pretty badass.  That was a brutal death scene for him because, again, he was that very mellow, you know, more  emotional and thinking man.  Yeah.  And there he is just getting his guts ripped out in a field. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  I mean, that's the kind of stuff, though, that people love to see.  They do.  That you just, if they would have glossed over it or tried to make it sweet, it just doesn't  work in that kind of atmosphere.  And that's what I really do like about the show is that you guys aren't afraid to get  brutal.  I mean, when you see a kid getting shot.  Just the first five minutes of the show.  That's pretty fucking brutal.  When I open up the script, it's like a six-year-old girl gets her head blown off.  I'm like, yep, I want to be on this show.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:21:30]  Pretty amazing.  Are you good with a gun?  You come off pretty good with a gun on the show.  You know, I'm all right.  You know, I did that show, The Pacific, and I learned a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  Sort of there.  I'm better with a long gun, but, you know, I learned a little bit.  Yeah, they kind of teach you on set.  A little bit, yeah.  You don't want to look like an asshole.  Yeah, you got to at least know how to hold it.  That's it.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It came off good.  I appreciate that.  And the rest of the cast is really great. 
[03:22:00]  What a nice mix of different personalities and stuff.  Yeah, I love them.  And, you know, Andrew Lincoln is just, I think he's just a phenom.  And, you know, they touch up.  I just saw the episode, you know, I guess the night before last.  And, you know, I know what he was doing that day after I died.  And he was whispering in my ear and crying in his eyes that he was doing some shit.  And I told him, I was like, look, man, I don't know if anyone's ever going to see that, 
[03:22:30]  but that was some fucking good-ass acting.  I mean, he was doing some crazy.  Wow.  And then, you know, I mean, it didn't make it into the show, but, you know, they just  left the cameras rolling.  He started beating my dead body.  And I had to lay there, you know, dead, because I was on camera too.  This motherfucker, have you seen his cowboy boots?  He wears his damn cowboy boots.  He's kicking me.  He's like, you did this, not me.  Kicking me in my face.  I'm like, motherfucker, that hurt.  And I'm, like, trying not to breathe, you know what I mean?  I'm, like, trying to, boom, I'm like, you did this. 
[03:23:00]  What day did you piss him off and make him wait in the trailer too long?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  I smell DVD extras.  I'd like to see that.  But, yeah, the whole group there, it's a real special group.  And, again, I think we really, through all the sort of offset drama that went down this  year, I think it just sort of solidified things with that cast and crew even more.  Yeah.  Yeah, and, you know, Sarah Wayne Cowley's Norman Reedus.  I mean, everybody. 
[03:23:30]  I just, I love them.  Yeah, it's a great cast.  And, I mean, you can't have a show where it's just, hey, they're shooting at zombies  this week.  Right.  So you do need good characters, good writing, and good actors to keep people coming back.  You know, the original storylines were pretty cool.  There was a bunch of different scenarios.  And I know you guys don't know, so I won't spoil anything down the road.  Better not.  I'm not even sure if you know anything about the future storylines.  But, I mean, there is a pretty major villain.  That's all I'll say.  Yeah, he's coming.  He's coming.  Let's see.  Now I'm back in. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Now I'm back in.  Will you have shut up, man?  Because, yeah, that was a pretty, that's a pretty intense situation.  Yeah, absolutely.  And, absolutely.  I can't wait for these guys to catch up.  I really wanted to be around for that, because I just wanted to, like, see how that was going  to go down.  But, you know, I guess I'll be watching on TV.  I mean, you know, in the books, obviously, you're not around.  Your character isn't around.  So it would have been interesting to see how your character would have reacted.  In a badass way.  In that kind of situation. 
[03:24:30]  I'm quite certain.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't worry, folks.  There's plenty of fucked up shit out there for you to watch on Walking Dead.  It's all coming.  Absolutely.  The finale is this coming Sunday.  And I know you can't say anything, but are we going to look at an ending that kind of  leaves us with a lot of questions?  Oh, brother.  Once I'm out, dude, they're like, clean out your trailer.  Get the fuck out, dude.  I'm ready.  You haven't seen it?  I haven't seen it.  I mean, fucking, I don't know what happens.  I mean, yeah, they're like, get the hell out of here, bro. 
[03:25:00]  On to the next, man.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks for being there.  Oh, damn, man.  Were you concerned last month when word kind of leaked that you may be in Frank's new show,  that people might have seen the end coming to you?  Man, there's been all this, like, back and forth.  But again, I'm a complete monkey on the internet, so I'm not, like, on it, you know.  But, you know, I did hear, you know, from my agents and stuff like that.  You know, we were, I think people were upset because it had come out.  And look, you know, we worked really hard to sort of, you know, Frank and I worked really hard to create this character of Shane. 
[03:25:30]  And then, you know, this season, you know, with the whole cast and the new writers and everything, you know, we want that to be a surprise.  And the last thing in the world I would ever want is that to be leaked and ruin the surprise.  That being said, you know, and then I think something came out, like, a season two DVD pre-sale came out.  Oh, yeah.  And one of the, like, hot things that they had on the DVD was Shane's last episode. 
[03:26:00]  And this was, like, three weeks ago.  I purposely didn't click on that link.  But, yeah, I heard that there was a big spoiler on one of the DVDs.  And I know, I mean, and, you know, the guys at AMC were, you know, they had reached out to me.  And, you know, they apologized for that going down.  They were really cool about it.  And, you know, it's one of those things where it just, look, I don't get, I just, it just sucks for the fans.  Sure, absolutely.  Who got fired.  Yeah, exactly.  Someone's head rolled on that one.  I used to hate when, like, I used to hate, like, watching 24 and they would announce halfway through the season that it had been picked up for another season. 
[03:26:30]  Right, right, right.  So I'm like, okay, well, now you know.  Yeah, he's not dying.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't like watching previews to the next week's show because sometimes it's not who's gone, but it's who's still there.  Yeah, who's, yeah.  It's like, oh, okay, I know nothing happens to that person.  Up until, you know, a certain point.  So I usually shut it off.  I don't watch the preview for next week's episode.  Yeah, it's like, why do it?  Yeah, I mean, that was the thing.  As far as the new show with Frank, you know, I knew that this would be my last season. 
[03:27:00]  And, you know, the fact that Frank sort of was going off in this new direction with this new show that he's so excited about.  I mean, look, as far as I'm concerned, Frank Darabont, you know, he is the walking dead.  But everyone that is there is there because of Frank.  He cast everybody.  He assembled that crew.  He hired those writers.  Like, he's the heart and soul.  And I think, you know, he's the reason why the show is not just simply what you said, a bunch of people killing a bunch of zombies. 
[03:27:30]  He's like, let's do this with real heart.  And let's make this about the characters.  And he fucking loves gore.  And he's a dark motherfucker.  So, like, all that's in there.  But, you know, look, man, the guy did Shawshank Redemption.  Yeah, which is insane.  He's the man, dude.  How do you work with that guy?  You know, I wouldn't be able to.  He's the man.  So it's like when I did know I was dying, but I also knew that he was writing this new show for me. 
[03:28:00]  It's like Frank Darabont's writing a show for me.  I mean, it's like the most touching fucking thing in the world, man.  And this new show is going to be, I think it's going to be badass.  And when's that starting?  We start shooting in May.  And I'm going to do a movie kind of like before and after it.  But I can't wait to get into it.  Yeah, you're kind of taken off.  That's pretty cool.  Well, shit, you know.  I don't know.  No, it's great, man.  Doing my best.  Everybody really enjoyed your character on Walking Dead.  And I'm here and we've got to wrap up.  You've got other things to do. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, that's cool, though.  Jon Bernthal.  Thank you guys for having me.  Walking Dead, well.  You can see my friends on it next week.  Watch his friends on it.  Watch it with Jon.  Buy the season two DVD when it comes out.  But if you have it DVR'd and haven't watched it yet, it's a great death scene.  Thank you.  I hope you enjoy it.  Thank you.  And Jon, thanks for coming in, man.  Thanks for having me, bro.  And guys, thanks for helping me out with my solo show today. 
[03:29:00]  The rest of the crew is gone today.  They're in various parts of the country and out of the country.  So I'm just doing a show myself.  And it's great because I don't have to fucking listen to anybody.  And we'll see you again tomorrow.  Thanks, Jon.  Thanks, brother.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live is next.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[03:29:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  This thing in here is giving me the creeps.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Well, I guess after Anthony Live.  Anthony has left the building, but the rest of us are still here.  Jon Bernthal is even still here around here somewhere.  He's not in the studio right now from The Walking Dead. 
[03:30:00]  He was in here a couple minutes ago, though.  He's still in the building.  He's doing other shows, but he's not here right now.  Just me.  The rest of the guys are wandering around here somewhere in this giant...  Am I supposed to...  I'm allowed to say what that is, right?  Where's Eric?  I'm allowed to talk about...  You can.  Yeah.  Eric brought in the...  I guess he got it overnighted and it got here on time.  The Jim Norton cardboard cutout that we're getting for when Jim's out of town so he can  still get his celebrity pictures.  Yeah.  It's creepy, man. 
[03:30:30]  There's a couple other people coming in and out today that we're going to try to see  if we can...  How many...  Who's coming in and out today?  Well, CeeLo's going to be here later.  Oh, man.  CeeLo Green?  Yeah.  So I'm going to see if everyone's cool, if CeeLo can take a photo with it.  That's cool.  It's creepy in here, though.  Well, I just put it up there for the changeover so that nothing happens to it.  I keep seeing it and thinking there's somebody in here.  He's got this weird smile on his face.  How do you see it?  I thought he's behind the TVs.  You can see it from there?  Yeah, I can see it from here.  Oh, wow. 
[03:31:00]  I see everything, Eric.  I'm all seeing and all knowing.  Well, it's a little taller than we had hoped for.  Yeah, I mean, it's way bigger than him.  Well, I gave them Jim's height and they only do it per foot.  So five foot look too short and six foot looks a little too big, but I'd rather go with  six foot than five foot.  Troy wants to get a look at it.  This is going to be a big thing, I think.  You just want to get a look at the cutout.  Yeah.  It's weird, right?  It's creepy.  Yeah, it's fucking weird.  It's great. 
[03:31:30]  I love it.  Had things go with you and that chick after you left here yesterday.  Everything was fine.  Carly?  Yeah, I mean, I walked her to the elevator.  You were fishing for something, but there was nothing there.  I wasn't fishing at all.  You were.  I was pointing out, listen, you had this chick on yesterday.  Yeah.  This 21-year-old that you met on Instagram.  Mm-hmm.  Troy.  The photos are up on the Opie and Anthony Facebook.  Check it out.  He's a guy.  The photos for her?  Yeah.  Look for yourself, okay?  This is a guy.  Look, I'm not faulting you for it, but let's be honest. 
[03:32:00]  A guy in his 30s.  We'll say mid-30s.  Early 30s.  Early to mid.  No, early.  Well, mid is 35, so can we say early to mid?  I'm not 35.  Okay.  A guy who's into his 30s.  Picking up chicks on Instagram.  No, I wasn't picking her up.  Well, you're making friends.  What do you need a 21-year-old female friend for?  Okay, and I explained this yesterday.  Here's what happened.  We started talking on there. 
[03:32:30]  I started following on Twitter.  What did you talk to her about?  Well, I mean, I was just looking at her pictures and commenting.  She'd comment, and she'd be witty.  So I was like, I'm going to check out her Twitter.  And she started tweeting funny stuff.  Yeah.  And she's like, I'm doing comedy.  She had posted some videos of her.  So hang on a second.  Let me speak.  You asked me if you said something.  Let me speak.  Right.  So she had said that she is a diehard, diehard Amy Schumer fan.  Yeah.  Okay?  And I said to her, would you be willing to do your stand-up routine in front of Amy Schumer  on the air? 
[03:33:00]  Right.  Okay?  So here's my thinking was, do it in front of Amy.  She gets it in front of Amy.  Right.  A cute, young, Italian chick from Long Island.  Anthony's going to think she's cool.  And she's like, freaky tattoos, crazy hair.  Jim will think she's fucking cool, too.  So it's like, why not do it on the show?  The only thing I think you're not admitting.  What's that?  If she didn't look like she looks, she wouldn't be considered witty.  Um, she has an interesting look.  And you know that when you do stand-up, your look is part of what, uh, what... 
[03:33:30]  She's a good-looking young girl.  Yeah, she is.  And she's not like, yeah, what's up, Roland?  Somebody just emailed me that they're a diehard Will Ferrell fan.  Should I bring them up, too?  Stupid.  The only thing is, she's not, she wouldn't be considered like, oh, she's funny if she  wasn't attractive.  Well, I mean, she was trying out her stuff, and she's a starting comic in front of, uh,  in front of Amy Schumer.  But you wouldn't consider her witty.  Like, you wouldn't say this is a witty person if she wasn't attractive.  I thought, I mean, she had funny tweets.  I thought...  Not for an ugly person. 
[03:34:00]  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know about that.  I don't know if I'd be paying attention if she was ugly.  Yeah.  And then, Eric, this is my big problem yesterday.  Eric.  What?  Troy goes after you any chance he gets.  Yeah.  Like, the minute he comes in...  Now, it's not in the sense, and he's made this very clear, Troy comes in, and when his  opinion is asked, he gives it.  Yeah.  And he always has a very strong opinion of you, and he always ends up dragging you through  the mud, talking about how heavy you are, how unsatisfied your wife is with your habits, 
[03:34:30]  how...  How...  Well, I think that's more of something you tend to bring up, Roland, than Troy.  Yeah.  I don't know anything about that.  Your lifestyle, how active you are, your work ethic he hounds on you for.  Mm-hmm.  Now, I hand this guy to you yesterday on a silver platter, and point out that he's  claiming that he thinks this girl is funny, when, if she was ugly, he wouldn't think she  was funny. 
[03:35:00]  That's what my whole thing was, and I set everything up for you, and you wouldn't, you refused to  criticize anything he does.  What am I going to attack him on?  He wants to hook up with young internet chicks.  I'm not hooking up with her.  That's what you attack him on, that you feel that way, and he's denying it.  What you attack him on is his...  But you were doing that already.  Why was I going to...  Because I set it up for you to do it.  No, I didn't.  Because it's a pile-on.  Troy, did I say I wanted a pile-on just so everybody would shit-stir and get on to this? 
[03:35:30]  Eric, I was giving you a shot to get back at somebody who makes fun of you constantly.  I don't care what he does.  That's what you don't get.  I don't care what Troy does.  You care, because you yell back at him.  And this is why...  Because I'm forced to.  This is why people go after you.  Because you don't take the shots when they're there for you.  They know you're not going to hit back.  Because I don't sit here and live my life waiting for a chance to attack everybody else.  But you didn't have to wait for it.  The guy who attacks you, he was given to you.  I said he was creepy.  No, you said the rest of the room said he was creepy.  Yeah, but I also said I was creepy, too. 
[03:36:00]  So that kind of diffuses that bomb.  But that's why people...  Do you think...  So you're comfortable being a punching bag?  What the fuck is your...  Now you're starting shit.  Go after him.  I want to hear that.  Because...  Why don't you put in front of him?  Why don't you take shots at him?  Because I don't give a fuck, Sam.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what makes you a punching bag.  If somebody's going to take shots at you...  Because you want to waste your time...  And then you want to take shots back.  ...constantly watching what I'm doing and worrying what I'm doing.  That's fine.  I don't care what he does. 
[03:36:30]  And besides, I'm not going to cock block him if that's what he's doing.  No, I wasn't doing that.  No?  Look at you.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  That's what he was doing.  But he said a hundred times.  Sometimes that's not what I'm doing.  Yeah.  And the minute you had to call him out on...  He calls you out on your bullshit constantly.  The minute that it's brought to the air that you can call him out for his bullshit, you just don't do it.  And you know he's going to do it to you again.  You know he's going to continue to call you out on your bullshit.  Well, it's my New Year's resolution to stop.  But you did it like a week ago. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, but the boss calls me in to ask my opinion.  What do you think of E-Rock's lifestyle?  You're not my boss.  It doesn't mean you won't tell me within three questions.  You have this three questions theory.  Yeah, that's what I think, that I think within three questions I could do it.  But it wasn't a matter.  It was a matter.  I just didn't understand how...  So you don't want to go after Troy.  I know what he's doing.  It doesn't matter.  He's trying to friend and help her career out. 
[03:37:30]  How many of us have tried doing that when we were single or whatever?  But if he's trying to hook up with this chick, why am I going to interfere with that?  That's why you would say it.  You don't bring somebody here to demonstrate their talent for seasoned professionals on a national radio show  if you're not trying to get something on the other end from it.  I don't care.  You're just not that nice.  And you guys are more than welcome to follow up with her at any time and ask her what our status is. 
[03:38:00]  It just was something that I was like, this might be funny for the show.  And I didn't know.  And I told her, you're going to get destroyed on the show.  Are you ready for this?  She's like, yeah.  So it was like just throwing something at the show like, hey, let's give this a shot.  And I had asked Jim before.  And he's like, yeah, that's cool.  That sounds fine.  Let's do it.  And then he asked Anthony.  And Anthony was cool with it.  Can we go by your apartment and ask her?  She's never seen my apartment.  Sure, sure, sure, sure.  Roland, were you surprised yesterday that... 
[03:38:30]  I was just surprised that Mars is not here doing his job.  Yeah, Mars has a couple other guys fixing the outlet in here.  Troy.  All right.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  Go ahead.  You saw what was going on.  What?  Like, you understood that I was giving Iraq a chance to hit you back.  Yeah.  Like, you knew when it was happening.  And I've told him this before on the air and off the air.  Like, dude, when I take shots or whatever, take a fucking shot.  Like, that's what this whole thing is about, isn't it?  It's like...  No, it's not about... 
[03:39:00]  So what is it about?  What's it about?  It's about Troy's issue.  Not...  This has nothing to do with me.  And she had a picture with Will Ferrell, too.  And she's like, where?  In a bigger...  In a bigger sense.  This whole thing meaning this is what we do.  Mm-hmm.  Like, Troy's going to continue to take shots at you as he should.  Mm-hmm.  But when Troy opens himself up for shots to be taken at him...  Yeah.  I just don't understand why you wouldn't...  Why you would just let it pass.  Like, this is your chance to be like, don't fuck around.  Like, how we talked about earlier.  How, like, yeah, fuck with me. 
[03:39:30]  But know that if you fuck with me, I'm going to hit you back harder.  Mm-hmm.  But people fuck with you because you don't hit back.  Because I don't care.  And isn't it like when you're in the studio air...  But you do care.  You don't like getting fucked with.  Do you like getting fucked with?  Nobody does.  But I'm not going to sit here and keep planning and...  No, shut the fuck up.  I'm not going to sit here and keep planning and mulling on how I'm going to get this person back.  Because you know what?  The cycle never fucking ends.  And I can't live like that.  Eric, it never ends because you never hit back.  No, it doesn't end because you don't stop this shit.  You could make it end.  You could make it end. 
[03:40:00]  You don't hit anyone back.  You know that there's people on this staff that you just don't want to pick a fight with because it's like...  Yeah, and that's another thing you assholes keep trying to do.  Why don't you punch him?  You sound like the fucking listeners.  Why don't you punch him?  Why don't you punch this guy?  Why don't you stand up?  Why don't you...  Because I don't fucking care.  You do care because you don't like it.  No, because I can't sit there all the time like you assholes and mull and complain and bitch about everything.  You do bitch.  You don't go...  You bitch about management all the time.  That's different.  It's not a matter of people mulling and bitching.  That's different.  It's a matter of when somebody comes forward with some bullshit that they would call you on, you call them on. 
[03:40:30]  You didn't have to mull about anything.  You are already going in through this.  I agreed with you and we were talking about it yesterday.  But because I didn't go and verbally attack them on this shit, it's my fault?  It's your fault for not taking shots.  Well, fuck you.  I don't need to do that.  Well, then, good.  Then you keep doing what you're doing.  I'm going to.  What, are you going to stop me?  No.  I'm just not participating in it.  Yes, you will.  You don't have to participate.  You coming in is participating.  Because you're going to get called out on bullshit while you're not calling other people out. 
[03:41:00]  And that's why it doesn't stop.  It's not a cycle.  It's a straight line.  No, because you assholes keep doing it.  Because you're not going to stop it.  It's a straight line.  Like, I'm not going to call Troy out on every single little thing he does because he's going to start some shit if I do.  This is not about me.  This is about him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  You're turning it into me and it has nothing to do with me.  What it has to do with you is this is a specific example of you letting people.  Thanks, Dad.  I appreciate the fucking life lesson. 
[03:41:30]  But this is about Troy, not about me.  Well, it was about Troy yesterday.  It's about you today.  It's not about me.  I just made it about you.  Why did you fucking take shots at him?  Who cares?  Because I did.  I took shots at him.  I wasn't talking about you, asshole.  I was talking about me.  Why didn't you take shots?  Because you care.  I joined in when you brought it up.  Troy, did he join in?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't jump in and fucking viciously attack him on it.  Well, I mean.  I knew what he was doing.  What am I going to block him from it?  No, you're going to call him out on lying about it. 
[03:42:00]  But that's not what I was doing.  But anyway.  Yeah, I mean, dude.  You just got to learn to step up.  It's like, you know, if you step up and you fired when you had a chance, people are going to stop fucking with you.  Uh-huh.  It doesn't stop.  You've never tried it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have plenty of time.  Like, if somebody goes after, if Sam comes after me and he starts, like, taking these, like, when Sam was taking shots at me that one day, I was like, all right, dude, fuck you.  You want to know what's up?  This is what's up.  And we got into it.  And we got into it.  It's like, you know, you have to, like, fire back. 
[03:42:30]  Because if you just open up your anus, you're just going to keep getting fucked in it.  Uh-huh.  I'm not looking for a fight.  You all seem to be doing that, and I don't give a shit.  Well, I mean, isn't that, I mean, it's not really a, it's not a fighting.  You're just, you're just.  But you have somebody who you just said is lying.  Like, you just said he did want to hook up with her.  He's saying he didn't.  And I said that yesterday, too.  And this is a person who calls you out on your bullshit constantly.  Okay, again, you're stirring the shit and pointing fingers on something that doesn't need to be involved with me. 
[03:43:00]  But this is why he's going to keep fucking with you.  This is not my scenario.  This is why he's going to continue to fuck with you.  No, this is why you're going to keep bringing this shit up.  What shit should be brought up?  Because everyone's not doing exactly what you do.  What are you talking about?  Do you, you don't want to get fucked with.  Okay, yeah.  This is, and Troy's going to continue to fuck with you because you don't hit him back.  I don't give a shit what he does, Sam.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Because you don't like it when he fucks with you, and that's giving a shit. 
[03:43:30]  I don't care what he does.  You care because you don't like it.  No, you fucking care about all this nonsense.  I don't give a shit.  You just said you didn't like it.  Nobody likes it.  So then that's not, that's caring.  If you didn't care, you wouldn't dislike or like it.  You dislike it.  No.  Stop trying to dig for something that's not here.  This seems here to everybody except you.  No, to you.  Troy, what are you doing over there?  I'm taking a photo from my Instagram.  Here.  Grab this.  I'm taking a photo from my Instagram here. 
[03:44:00]  I've been doing the new Jimmy cutout.  He's got a big head in that cutout, man.  He does.  It looks good, though.  Jim's going to be excited to see this.  Yeah.  It needs to be one of those things.  There should be multiple ones, and we give them to people, and then they go all over the  world and have Jim's picture taken in various locations.  Not at $400.  Yeah.  It looks good, though.  He's wearing a sweater, too, so I'm sure he's excited about that.  Because he loves that sweater.  That's a big thing for him. 
[03:44:30]  James, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  James!  Phones are fucked up.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's the second person.  You there, James?  No.  Chris, does it work for you?  It works for me, buddy.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, what's up, dude?  I got two questions.  Hey, Troy, what does this chick's pussy taste like?  I don't know.  I didn't taste her pussy.  Yet.  And E-Rock, what does your pussy taste like?  Throw some fucking balls, baggot.  Whoa.  Thanks, Chris.  It's weird around here. 
[03:45:00]  I mean, don't get it fucked up.  If she was like, do you want to use my vagina?  You would.  Yeah.  But I'm not trying to pursue it.  Did you hear her Will Ferrell picture yet?  I sent her, yeah.  I mean.  A-list comic, a-list actor.  Yeah, I mean, Will Ferrell's a great picture to get.  I always thought it was the C-list, man.  He starts with the A-list.  Yeah. 
[03:45:30]  Well, I think that was just a nice serendipitous coincidence.  Serendipitous, my ass.  He knew.  What's up?  She's here Friday.  Her being here.  Amy's here Friday, too.  I mean, I don't think.  Should I bring her back?  Troy brought the chick in to meet Will Ferrell.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was, that's just lined up, you know, as a coincidence.  But I also don't think you would think she was funny or care about supporting her comedy  career if she wasn't a little hot.  Well, I explain myself.  And I think you know that I have a valid point. 
[03:46:00]  You're not going to admit it.  Of her horrible timing.  Oh, I'm a very honest person.  Sometimes.  Sometimes you like to skirt around on certain issues.  I don't think so.  Greg in Maryland.  Hey, I didn't think I'd say this, but I actually agree with E-Rock.  He was not part of the conversation yesterday.  He doesn't feel like piling on him.  So why should he be involved in it?  Because I brought him in.  He won't be involved in it.  So I agree with E-Rock.  You're trying to drag him into something that he doesn't want to be in.  Because, like, Troy constantly, you've heard Troy bashing E-Rock before, right? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, I've heard all that.  But that doesn't mean that Eric's got to get into it.  If Eric, if that's not his personality and he doesn't want to bash people, then don't drag him into it.  But don't you think that if Eric did hit back when he saw an opportunity, he wouldn't get hit so much?  But that's not his personality.  And even if it gets hit, and, you know, whether it bothers him or whether it doesn't bother him, his personality is, that's not who he is. 
[03:47:00]  So why try to force him into something that he's not comfortable doing?  Because when somebody hits you, you've got to hit them back if you want them to stop.  That's not the solution to everything.  It is here.  I mean, Troy, are you going to stop because Eric doesn't want to hit you back?  No.  He's managed to get a good career so far, being the guy that he is.  He's miserable every day here.  Miserable.  Can't stand it.  He's miserable in his big house.  That's a good point.  What's up, Dan?  You're on after Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:47:30]  Hey, sorry about that.  Fuck the E-Rock situation.  He's just a lazy bum.  He's going to do whatever.  Sam, I'm fucking pissed at you.  Why?  How in the hell can you be from Kentucky?  You and your both are from Kentucky.  You're not going for UK?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  My family's from Kentucky.  I know.  Okay.  But I'm more, Murray State is a closer Kentucky school to where my family's from, so I'm all  about Murray State.  Oh, really?  Well, yeah.  I'm from Owensboro and love UK, man. 
[03:48:00]  You piece of shit.  They're going to go the whole fucking way.  Shut up.  If they don't bomb like they did the other day.  All right.  Thanks, Dan.  That's all I got, man.  See you later.  Um, here you go.  Howard, Tennessee.  Yeah, why don't you quit being a little bitch?  You're trying to manipulate these guys to fight like you're Vince McMahon and they're  your little act, man.  Troy, do you feel manipulated?  Yes.  Well, yeah.  That was Roland's voice.  You're definitely a ringleader.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you manipulate situations to stir shit and to get this person angry at this person. 
[03:48:30]  Then you'll, you'll feed into stuff and you'll, you'll say something that wasn't, you know,  it's completely fabricated in your mind.  Like what was fabricated?  Well, I don't know about this situation, but you've, you've said certain things before  that you've just made up stuff.  Yes, that's true.  Yeah.  Uh, just to, just to add to the, the, you know, you're a fucking, but in this scenario  that we're talking about.  Yeah.  He's a bitch.  I mean, that's all he is.  Who, Sam?  Well, yeah, Sam.  Oh, okay. 
[03:49:00]  He's a shit.  Sam is a shit, sir.  That, that was, by the way, you took that technique from me.  That's something I would do.  He's like, he's like the little girl in a school.  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  Shut up.  He's sorry.  What's this guy's, dude?  This guy's raising some good points.  I hung up on him.  You're just agreeing with him for the sake of agreeing with him.  Thank you for the, your comments.  We should give him a DVD for valid points.  With DVD?  Well, I hung up on him already.  Here.  Maybe we can give one to this guy.  Um, Kyle in Ontario.  Sam.  Yeah.  I love listening to your shows and everything, but what in the fuck? 
[03:49:30]  You call this actual radio today?  Like, did I listen to the past week and all I've heard is,  E-Rock, E-Rock, E-Rock, E-Rock's fat, E-Rock's lazy, E-Rock's sick.  You know how fucking annoying it honestly gets as a listener?  We were just talking about Troy yesterday.  I mean, that's what we do here is we talk about the people who work on the show.  I understand.  I understand it's a bit, but holy shit.  It's not a bit. 
[03:50:00]  Well, my brain's out here, man.  Do it.  Peace.  It's not a bit.  I mean.  Raises a good point.  I mean, it's a lot of E-Rock.  Yeah.  You want me to stop talking about E-Rock so much?  Yeah.  Because I could talk about you guys instead.  Do what he says.  Because Roland threw a Sharpie at me earlier today because he was mad at Danny.  Right, Roland?  No.  Why were you mad at Danny?  What happened?  No, man.  Well, then why'd you throw a Sharpie at him?  Because it's a shit shirt.  All right. 
[03:50:30]  Well, I mean, you didn't want me to talk about Eric.  Like, Danny was making fun of him for wearing T-shirts.  My Linsanity.  Right.  And he was saying that he doesn't like bandwagon jumpers.  And so he was making fun of Roland for switching.  I'm a bandwagon jumper.  I wait until the complete stops and I crawl it up.  So he was, yeah, no reason to jump.  Just step off, right?  Step on, step off.  So Roland, I guess because the Knicks have lost six games in a row, he stopped wearing  his Linsanity shirts.  And he's wearing... 
[03:51:00]  And jersey, I put it away.  He put it away and now he's wearing a Yankees shirt.  Go Yankees.  So Danny was giving him shit for it during a commercial break, right?  Yeah.  And then Danny brought it up again while we were on the air and he was waiting for, what's  his name from Walking Dead?  John from Walking Dead to come in.  And Roland wasn't saying anything to Danny, but then I said something like...  You went, ooh!  No, no, no, no.  I didn't even say that.  I said, Roland, this guy coming in late really, you know, we were really trying to keep a tight  schedule on the show today.  And then when he said something, he went, ooh!  Which was a joke about the show not being terribly on schedule today, which is what we do. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  And then Roland threw a Sharpie at me because...  But that wasn't...  It was a good throw, though.  But he chucked it out.  He wasn't mad at me.  It was a good throw, though.  Right.  He was quick.  He was quick.  He was taking out that Danny anger.  Yeah.  I think.  That happens a lot around here.  You know that.  Taking out Danny anger?  No, no, no.  Just like people will be angry at one person and then they'll just take it out on somebody  else because that person's just easier to...  Like Iraq yelling at me instead of yelling at you?  Yeah.  I guess.  But, I mean, he doesn't want to pick a fight with you. 
[03:52:00]  I'm an easy guy to pick a fight.  I mean, as long as you don't mind going on for a while, I'm not going to go crazy.  Yeah.  You know how to take your shots.  And you know how to say stuff that's like...  Oh, man.  Like, yeah, you're going to a shitty place here.  I don't go that shitty, though.  Sometimes.  You can go pretty shitty.  I don't think I cross the line.  Sometimes.  You think so?  When you get, like, the real shit stirring, you're like...  You can go there.  I enjoy it.  You like it.  I love it.  Yeah.  But sometimes I get scared. 
[03:52:30]  Dan in New Orleans.  Everybody...  I mean, listen.  This is what I'm saying.  I like when people call up and stick up for E-Rock.  But I wish E-Rock would stick up for E-Rock sometimes.  Yeah.  Like, if E-Rock would be, like, telling people,  Shut up, faggot!  And all the...  You know.  Maybe.  I don't know.  What's up, Dan?  What's going on with the phones today?  Can you hear me, Dan?  Anyone in New Orleans?  Try the other side.  Try the other bank.  Put him on hold.  All right.  Dan?  This is weird. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  I got some good news, though.  What's that?  It's weird with the...  You fucker?  No.  I put the picture of the Jim Norton cardboard cutout up on my Instagram.  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan on Instagram?  Yeah.  With Roland.  Roland's in the picture as well.  Yay.  All right.  I'm getting...  I'm getting a line from...  Maybe there's...  Marge should check the phones, I guess, after this show.  He did shake it twice.  He's going to find out who's naughty or nice?  He's nice.  What's up, Justin?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing? 
[03:53:30]  All right.  So, listen.  Basically, you guys are all assholes.  We're all cool with that.  That's why we like your show.  Fair enough.  But I think that you have a form of penis envy when it comes to E-Rock.  You know, you've got E-Rock who lives in a mansion.  He's got a hot wife.  And he doesn't necessarily need to pick fights all the time.  You can't even go into the boss's office and get a fucking raise above $40,000 a year.  So, you know what?  You just keep letting all of us know how pissed off you are by attacking him all the time.  E-Rock will go to his hot wife and get blown in his fucking hot tub that's probably in his bedroom. 
[03:54:00]  It's not hot.  The hot tub and the pool's not completed yet.  Well, I mean, I'm not...  I don't know.  First of all, that's envy.  Not penis envy.  His ball sack, though.  I don't have envy of Eric's penis, per se.  And I don't have envy of Eric's wife.  I mean, I also have a very attractive fiancÃ©.  I don't think I'm doing this because I'm jealous of his mansion.  Although, that would be nice to have.  You know that.  Look, I would love to live in the house that E-Rock lives in.  Yeah.  And he's done what he's done to afford himself a lifestyle. 
[03:54:30]  What's that?  I can't put my finger on it.  But I'm saying whatever he's done has afforded him this lifestyle.  He leaves earlier than you, right?  At times, but...  And he has that house?  That's got to hurt a little bit, right?  I mean, Eric...  Maybe this guy's right.  You see what Troy's doing here.  No, no, I'm just agreeing with the caller.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm agreeing with the caller that Sam is a little bit jealous.  You think so?  Well, yeah.  I mean...  Me yelling at E-Rock because he didn't defend himself is me being jealous.  Well, I'm just following up with what this caller said.  By his logic, is what you're saying. 
[03:55:00]  I think you're jealous because his pool is bigger than Anthony's.  I don't even know if he has a pool.  Yeah, Justin.  Hey, Sam.  Just like the former caller said, you're just a bitch, Sam.  Thank you, Justin.  Bitch.  The South really does not like you.  They don't?  It's all Southern callers.  I mean, they go up and down, but they're on your side today, which is fine.  Because a lot of them are a little more plump down there.  You see, this is what I'm talking about.  And why is that?  Is that something E-Rock is, too? 
[03:55:30]  Well, they just feel they...  See, that's where it's unnecessary.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying that they...  What, are you going to stop it?  No, no, no.  Here, I'm going to explain myself.  You get goofed on for being a little bit overweight, and they just relate to that because they're  plumped themselves.  Who goofs on him for being a little bit overweight?  Everybody.  Including Jim.  Everybody.  Who else other than Opie and Jim?  Everybody.  Roland.  And?  You.  And?  The rest of the staff.  Which is?  Danny.  And?  Travis.  And?  Myself.  That's what I thought.  That's everybody.  Why can't they just be blanketed under everybody? 
[03:56:00]  And some more than others.  That's me.  John, can you hear me?  Yeah.  Okay, what's up?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  I think Troy's obsessed with E-Rock because no matter what he does, he just can't get under  his skin because E-Rock just doesn't care.  Yeah, but E-Rock...  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, as far as E-Rock's house, doesn't his wife also have a good career?  You know, that might be something to do with, like, his wife probably pays off the bills, 
[03:56:30]  so he's got that going for him, too.  Yeah, he lives a good life.  He lives a good life.  And I firmly believe that E-Rock says he doesn't care but actually absolutely cares.  I guarantee he cares.  He doesn't like it.  Right.  And, I mean, and that's not to say that he should not care.  He should not like it.  I wouldn't like it.  I don't like it when I get shit on.  Right.  But that's why I start swinging back.  Right.  That's the only difference.  I think E-Rock cares and that's just, you know...  Do you just think he's not witty enough to fire back? 
[03:57:00]  No, I think he...  I think he...  I don't know why he doesn't fire back, to tell you the truth.  At this point, I don't know why anymore.  He doesn't care.  He does, Roland.  He does care.  And, Roland, don't try to take E-Rock's side because he's within earshot.  We all know what your little M.O. is.  M.O.?  Yeah.  Don't throw ginkles at me.  You're right.  You're right, Roland.  I won't.  I shouldn't have.  Take another bitch call if they call you.  Okay.  I mean, I can't just keep taking phone calls. 
[03:57:30]  Do you have any DVDs you want to give someone?  I have the Killing on AMC, the show.  Okay.  Scott in Syracuse.  How we doing?  What's up, buddy?  Let me go all the way.  Hey, I wanted to agree with you on the E-Rock point.  I mean, E-Rock, seriously, if you just stand up for yourself and punch back, wouldn't it  be great if you had that same life as Sam and had the joy of explaining to your fiancee  why you can't afford a 22-inch television?  Does he win a DVD, Roland? 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, he hung up.  Why would he hang up?  Oh, good.  Can I win a copy of The Killing?  I really want to watch that show.  Sure, you won.  Yes.  Okay.  Congratulations, Travis.  And guess what?  I have a 3D TV.  What's up?  Brackets.  Brackets.  Troy, do you have your brackets ready?  No, I don't do that.  Sure case, we should.  You're not going to do it with the show?  I don't know anything about it, dude.  None of us do.  You think I know anything about it?  Just somebody pick it.  That's fine.  I don't give a shit.  No, you pick it.  Iona can be a sleeper.  I pick mine.  Iona's going to be a sleeper.  They're awesome.  And Duke has that three-brother team.  Yeah.  So you're in this. 
[03:58:30]  I'm in this.  Travis?  I'm in.  What's your team name?  Dr. Gay.  Okay, that's just so people can find you.  Just so they can find me.  It has nothing to do with real life.  You're doing brackets, right?  Yeah, I'm going to figure out how to do it today.  Did you think?  It's actually easy.  All you do is have to...  I just pick teams.  What's the website?  Well, you can go to SiriusXM.com slash hoops.  Yeah.  And once you sign up and everything, signing up is free.  You click on, like, join a public league, and we're like the first or second league right there.  All you have to do, and then the password is Ropers.  Yeah, password's Ropers.  R-O-P-E-R-S. 
[03:59:00]  Yes.  And then you just pick a team name.  And, like, literally, there's just one team on top of the other, and you just click whatever arrow you think is going to win.  And you know what's good?  Oh.  Thursday afternoon, say.  Yeah, Thursday afternoon.  It's great, too, because if you don't know anything about college basketball, like all of us, when you mouse over the team names, they'll show you what percentage of people have picked that team.  So if you see 100%, you're like, all right, well, I've got to pick that team.  I was noticing that.  Because they're obviously going to win.  You could go in there and just pick the favorites.  Yeah.  I picked some underdogs, though. 
[03:59:30]  Well, Sam Syracuse could win.  I know.  I picked them at least going to the final four.  But I can't finish my brackets yet, as I said on the show earlier today, because the big BYU-Iona play-in game is still happening.  If BYU wins, they're not going to do shit.  But if Iona wins, Iona, I don't know if you know this, Troy, the college right near where I went to high school.  So on that note, if Iona wins, I have them going to the final four as well.  Well, there you go. 
[04:00:00]  Troy, here's why you do it.  Because people who know a lot about college basketball and are playing this seriously get really upset when people like you and me, who know absolutely nothing, do better than them by just blindly picking things.  Fair enough.  That's the sport you don't know about, college basketball?  College sports.  I don't know college basketball, college football.  It's just too much.  Too many teams.  Too many teams.  I would have to just sit there, and it's way too much studying and figuring shit out.  Because you're the sports guy on the show.  That's why I did the promo.  I've heard your voice in the promo.  You never do promo. 
[04:00:30]  You did a great job with the sports guy.  A little fence at us, I am, too.  Sports guys?  Yeah.  You saw when rolling through that pen at me, right?  Yeah.  You know that was Danny Anger, not Sam Anger, right?  I don't know if it was Danny Anger.  It was Anger at someone that wasn't me.  It was a good throw.  It was a great throw.  Maybe it's because he had his baseball shirt on.  It almost took my head off with a Sharpie.  It was a pen.  But it was Anger at somebody who wasn't me.  Do you follow college basketball?  Yeah, I'll watch that.  So do you watch it? 
[04:01:00]  I've never heard a less convincing sentence in my life.  I love the voice.  No, I watch the voice instead.  You don't have to.  Team Blake, whoo!  Do you know anything about college basketball?  So are you making things up right now when you're saying Syracuse?  They could go all the way.  Duke is doing really well.  Dude, you watch ESPN, SportsCenter, and you're caught up in two seconds.  Yeah, you watch for five minutes and you know who the real good team is.  I know Syracuse, Kentucky, watch out.  They talk about Iona on SportsCenter?  Yeah.  Not Iona.  No, they don't. 
[04:01:30]  Maybe because they have a game today.  They picked them at the Cinderella team, the Super.  To go all the way?  The Final Four.  That's right.  I don't think that's going to happen.  I don't think that's â€“ I don't know if that's true, but â€“  Well, the guys did.  But I picked them as my team.  Did you get Travis's info for the DVD?  Yeah, I'll pick up on that info.  Have you thought â€“  I'll give it to Paul.  What's your team name going to be in the brackets?  March Madness.  Dick in the Ass.  I knew it was going to be Dick in the Ass.  That's actually a great â€“ are you going to really do that?  Yeah, if I can. 
[04:02:00]  Unless it's some asshole taken by the time I get to my computer.  No, you should have said it on the Ass.  You could do a Dick in the Ass with an at sign or Dick in the Ass with money signs because  you're going to win, Roland.  Your money.  How much do you win?  Well, we wouldn't win anything if we won.  Well, fuck.  Why do we play?  Yeah, what's the point of that then?  For fun.  It's not fun.  To piss off the people who are like â€“  What do the listeners win?  A thousand dollars.  You know what?  Once you do it, you don't have to do anything else.  You don't have to constantly maintain it.  So you just pick it and then it's â€“  But then you don't win.  Wait, wait, wait.  Does this kind of like a meeting like we actually did something? 
[04:02:30]  What did you do?  You can't go into our staff meeting today, Roland, and say, well, I picked my brackets.  It's something.  It is something.  It's for the show, right?  It's for the show, yeah.  It's for the show.  Can I try it today at the meeting?  Well, I speak first, so I'm probably going to say it.  Can I also say it?  I mean, if I did it.  If you want to.  If that's what you did.  Danny could.  Did Danny pick his brackets yet?  Yeah.  He could say it.  Actually, you can't say it because you haven't completed your brackets.  Can I say it and then say I will finish that after tonight's game to find out if I own it?  We really only like to talk about completed ideas. 
[04:03:00]  Not like potential?  No.  Troy, I mean, if you pick your brackets before noon, you can get it going on at the meeting.  Everyone's got a talking point if you do your brackets.  Well, I can also say that I'm going to be working on my brackets.  Yeah, I would allow Troy to say that.  Or you can say you can find another girl on Instagram.  Get a fuck yourself.  Troy is giving Roland a death stare.  Roland's in my new Instagram picture. 
[04:03:30]  You have to check it out.  It's the picture of Norton, the cardboard cutout.  It's Troy Kwan on Instagram.  And the good news is if you're a good-looking girl, Troy will get you on the show if you're on Instagram.  And you'll get a picture with an A-lister.  Yeah.  He'll get you celebrity pictures.  You don't have to be funny as long as you're hot.  It's all good.  I'm saying it's all good.  If you have tits and a twat, come on down.  We're just teasing, Troy.  I don't give a shit.  That's funny.  I know.  Well, listen.  I hope we've all come out of this experience a more valuable set of people. 
[04:04:00]  I feel I have.  I'm glad.  Eric, how are you feeling?  I'm fine.  Okay, good.  He's pissed.  I was listening to the office.  Eric did not sound happy.  I see the look in his face.  He's pissed.  Is he pissed at me?  Yeah, he's pissed at you.  He's always pissed at you.  You know what he's pissed at?  Yeah.  Himself.  Why is that?  Because he knows he should have fucking said some shit to you yesterday.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Um, who's coming in tomorrow?  Is Jim here tomorrow?  Jim's here.  Mike Baker.  Oh, okay. 
[04:04:30]  Uh, there's another guest only for the final confirmation.  Any hints?  Man or woman?  Man.  Okay.  That's the hint.  Okay.  Mike Baker.  And then Thursday is Donald Sutherland.  That's right.  That's a big guest.  And then Friday is Louis Black with Amy Schumer.  Big week of radio still to come.  Make sure you stay tuned to this channel.  And also Troy's going to find another girl between now and Friday for Amy Schumer and Louis Black.  Good looking.  So hit me up on Instagram.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan.  What up, ladies?  If you're quasi-funny or suck donkey balls, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter. 
[04:05:00]  As long as you have nice tits.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.
