<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of Sirius satellite radio and Howard Stern, contrasting their perceived struggles with XM's apparent success.  The hosts relentlessly mocked Stern's situation, highlighting Sirius's reported inability to supply radios and contrasting it with XM's readily available stock.  Hyundai's partnership with XM was also ridiculed, leading to a barrage of insults about Hyundai drivers.  Callers contributed to the segment, with one highlighting the hypocrisy of Stern criticizing Hyundai while Sirius was available in other car brands, and another mentioning Sirius's gay-themed channel, further fueling the mockery.  The hosts speculated on Stern's programming choices, predicting a lack of diverse talent due to insecurity.  The discussion then segued into a humorous anecdote about staffer Danny's successful guerrilla marketing stunt involving an Opie and Anthony sign during a live news broadcast about the Newsweek Koran controversy.  This transitioned into a discussion of Star Wars merchandise, sparked by a caller's anecdote about finding a Star Wars-themed basement.

The show continued with a discussion of the Star Wars movies, focusing on criticism of later installments and their perceived shift towards a younger audience.  The hosts dissected a Burger King commercial featuring Darth Vader and Yoda, finding the juxtaposition humorous.  A caller claimed increased sexual success due to his Star Wars fandom.  A technical issue then caused a brief interruption before the conversation shifted to a humorous story about musician Pepper Keenan being found asleep in his hotel room with a woman.  The hosts then previewed upcoming segments featuring Sue Johansson on sex and relationships, and a discussion about a rape at a Manhattan nightclub.

The broadcast then covered Ellen DeGeneres' revelation about childhood sexual abuse, interspersed with inappropriate humor from the hosts.  Persistent phone line problems continued.  Opie’s damaged car mirror provided another humorous self-deprecating moment, followed by a brief call before the Sue Johansson segment. This segment delved into discussions about prehistoric vibrators, male birth control pills, and the possibility of contracting STDs from toilet seats.  A caller’s offensive joke about an "Indian chick with large tits" elicited confused reactions.  A video clip of Colin Quinn forcibly kissing a female news reporter during an interview concluded this segment, provoking amusement from the hosts, followed by further discussion of Sue Johansson and vibrator size and functionality.

The show then tackled the lack of nerve endings in the upper two-thirds of the vagina, leading to a joke about women being good heroin mules. Pictures of centenarians were shown, sparking jokes about their appearances and lifestyles.  John from Arizona called in, boasting about sexual exploits with older women, specifically mentioning bingo halls and women in their sixties.  The discussion turned to penis size and its perceived importance for women’s sexual pleasure, with the hosts and guest, Bill Burr, sharing their perspectives.  Clips from Sue Johansson’s sex advice show were played and heavily criticized and mocked.

A call with American Idol contestant Anthony Federov followed, discussing his experience, Simon Cowell's criticism, and his future plans. The segment concluded with a live broadcast of a plane attempting an emergency landing due to a suspected landing gear malfunction, with the hosts and guests reacting with a mix of humor and commentary.  The safe landing was followed by further discussion of Sue Johansson’s sex advice and a brief mention of Bill Burr’s new CD.

Comedian Bill Burr's guest appearance dominated a later segment, featuring discussions about George W. Bush, a graphic sexually explicit song from Burr's CD, and a profane argument between a father and son captured on video.  Other topics included pre-kindergarten expulsions for bad behavior (including rape), a fake news story about a lion fighting midgets in Cambodia, offensive racial slurs in a discussion about traffic and the suburbs, a news segment about parallel parking, a segment with Brittany and Ricky from a reality show, and a Vonage commercial.  The show concluded with a promotion for Brother Joe's U2 tribute band's show at BB King's, including a ticket giveaway.

A final segment revisited the XM/Sirius rivalry, noting XM's larger market share. A rumor about Travis potentially appearing on the show was mentioned, along with their upcoming live performances.  The segment promoted Bill Burr's new CD, "Trinkets I Own Made From Gorilla Hands," available at eatabullet.com, with Burr himself giving a brief plug for his website, BillBurr.com.  A crude joke about an unnamed "old bag" concluded the show.

[00:03:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:04:00]  Get to it! 
[00:04:30]  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  All in the radio rips me off.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  Come on, everybody.  Come on, everybody.  Come on.  Come on, everybody.  Wake up.  Come on, everybody.  Wake up.  Okay.  Morning, Mr. Backfest. 
[00:05:00]  Can I have nothing to eat cereal?  Okay.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  Don't eat my cereal.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food. 
[00:05:30]  I pity the poor food.  I pity the poor food.  Sandy Cain Ward.  Are you right? Are you right? Are you right?  Oh, ow.  I'll take this.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Saving Private Ryan.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program, the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:06:00]  Hello.  Taking pleasure every single day that we're destroying regular radio. It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Ah.  XM Satellite Radio. 70% of the market, Anthony.  There you go.  70% of the satellite radio market.  Over 4 million people on board.  Yeah, a lot of articles about how XM reached 4 million subs, I guess, late last week.  Nice.  Very nice.  Mmm. 
[00:06:30]  But some people would like to claim that XM is failing miserably.  Yeah, yeah.  What a fucking tool.  want to spin those great numbers and great product into something bad.  Hey, we might be just spewing propaganda.  You know, why don't you just go to some independent sources and see what they say about XM Satellite Radio and the little doggy company. 
[00:07:00]  Wouldn't it be great to, uh, you know, expose us as liars?  Mm-hmm.  But, unfortunately, there's, uh, there's numbers to back it up.  There's Wall Street people.  You know, you know, things that aren't fudged.  And, uh, some people just can't take it.  No, they're losing their minds.  Some people have to twist things and, and just outright lie and sound really desperate and stupid.  Hyundai got so many letters from, um, uh, people, just random people saying we'd never want, we never want any kind of, uh, uh, Sirius Satellite Radio in Hyundais because, you know, it has that horrible Howard Stern on it. 
[00:07:30]  That's crazy.  Yeah, well, well, either it was a bunch of, like, religious kooks.  You know, the religious kooks are completely frazzled now.  I'm going off regular radio.  This is how they made money.  Right.  They used to send out letters that said, please send us money to get Howard Stern off the radio.  They got you off and now they're not happy.  Yeah, right.  So, which I left. 
[00:08:00]  Because XM has, like, I think they have Playboy channel on theirs.  Well, they have Opie and Anthony who essentially went into a church and had listeners have sex in a church.  I mean, you know, I don't, I don't know that they're any cleaner.  Thank God they don't have that horrible Howard Stern.  Howard Stern, or they have, they have a, you know, as filthy programming as ever.  Oh.  Is this guy just coming off as sounding desperate?  God.  We told you, Howard, it wouldn't be so easy, you idiot.  He is scared shitless. 
[00:08:30]  Let me tell you what's going on, because he won't tell you.  Hyundai passed on Sirius as far as, you know, getting it installed in their cars.  And, you know, they cited because of Howard Stern in this press release that went out, I guess, late last week or whatever.  Okay.  Or early this week.  I don't know when.  But the problem is, and we've been saying this all along, when you're counting on one particular programming for your entire platform, that's where you're going to have problems. 
[00:09:00]  And that's what Hyundai was looking at, thinking, wow, the only thing they really have is Howard Stern.  And XM has a lot more variety.  They've got the Major League Baseball, and they're spread out.  There's a lot more choices with the XM satellite radio.  That's what that's all about.  Not putting all their eggs in one basket.  Right.  You know, Sirius, putting all their eggs in one basket, and that is Howard, you know, paying him a boatload of money.  But the problem is that that's the only thing they're touting over there. 
[00:09:30]  And people are starting to take notice and saying, whoa, wait a minute.  That's all they got.  And a bunch of our customers, you know, a lot of our customers want more from their satellite radio.  Sure.  Absolutely.  What a dope.  What a desperate sounding moron.  I wonder why she drives a BMW.  Maybe because Hyundai's a piece of crap?  Yeah, because they sold enough Hyundai.  Oh, maybe because Hyundai's the gay car?  I mean, do you know any straight people that drive a Hyundai?  Well, they don't want to be seen in them. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, you would have to be very gay to drive a Hyundai.  And poor.  It's for poor gay people.  Now they're bashing the car.  Of course, because it didn't pick up Sirius.  Right.  Picked up XM.  Right.  Picked up Sirius, they would be, you know, touting the Hyundai.  Because Howard's a phony.  But now they'll bash it.  Well, you know something?  Bash all you want.  It's just another car company with an exclusive XM deal to put their XMs in the cars right on the assembly line. 
[00:10:30]  There you go.  Rolls out.  It has XM in it.  Ready to go.  Unlike the wonderful car deals Sirius has where you have to, I don't know, do you have to grease the dealer at the car dealership?  And then he goes on his spare time and stalls it himself?  How do their car deals work?  I honestly don't know.  I have no clue. 
[00:11:00]  All I know is it's a lot more handy and convenient when they roll right off the assembly line with the radios in them.  All built in nice.  I know my vehicle has it all built right in.  You don't even know it's there until you turn it on.  But I guess that's a bad thing.  Anyway, everyone's gearing up for me going over to satellite.  Everyone?  And they're getting clobbered, XM.  Ah!  They're getting clobbered.  In fact, I was over at Sirius and I said, I want to give away some free radios. 
[00:11:30]  They go, we can't even keep them in stock.  All right.  Look, if you weren't with us, like, for the past few clips and what we've been saying, that one just says it all.  Yeah.  We're getting clobbered over here.  Just announced over four million subs.  We're getting clobbered because our radios are in the cars and in the stores and available to anyone who wants them. 
[00:12:00]  But we're getting clobbered because he asked his boss for a couple of radios and they couldn't give him one.  Maybe it's because the welders aren't done welding the case together for the radio yet.  Yeah, the welders went on strike.  Oh, my God.  They're waiting for them to come back to work.  Maybe another steel shipment has to come in.  Oh, my God.  He's a delusional old woman. 
[00:12:30]  He is so scared.  Dude, how could you say that the day after that everybody?  And, you know, don't listen to the propaganda here if you don't want to.  That's fine.  But go listen to Wall Street where they, you know, they're telling it like it is.  Everyone came out and said that we have 70% of the market.  So how are we getting killed?  How is XM getting killed, Howard?  Why don't you explain that?  We're getting killed.  Oh, my God.  He is delusional.  He's a lying phony who is running scared because this is a big move. 
[00:13:00]  And the excitement just isn't there.  It really isn't there.  They thought there was going to be this huge thing.  When they first announced it, there was this big push.  And now it's, you know, it's back to business as usual.  He's doing a, you know, lackluster show.  Sirius' stock is back in the toilet where it was.  It had a little spike with the excitement of the announcement. 
[00:13:30]  That's back to nothing again.  And they're just not selling the amount of radios that we are over here.  It just isn't happening.  And he's going on every day just lying and lying and lying and lying and lying.  If this son of a bitch gets me to the point where I start feeling sorry for him, I'm going to be pissed.  I'm going to be pissed.  Because that always seems to happen.  When I just can't stand somebody and you pounce on them.  And then you start going, oh, shit. 
[00:14:00]  Now I feel sorry for him and I can't do it anymore.  I'm such a douchebag.  We do have a list of people that that is happening to him.  I know.  You hate him.  You want to crush him.  And then when it starts happening, you're like, oh, I feel bad for him.  Fuck me.  I feel sorry for him.  If he starts getting to that point, I'm going to be pissed.  You know what happened to me on the gig last week?  I was trying to sell CDs and I was out of them.  Yeah.  And I went to the store to buy a U2 CD and they had them. 
[00:14:30]  And I realized I was burying U2 in CD sales.  Right, because you were out.  Now wait for stupid to write in.  Dude, there's plenty of U2 CD.  I'll get you one for Bono himself.  It's just classic.  This is a lot of fun.  And that's the difference.  I'm going to point it out every day.  We're still having fun doing a radio show.  He's not.  Simple as that.  That's what it comes down to.  Let's go to Mark at Oklahoma City. 
[00:15:00]  Mark, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going this morning?  Pretty good, man.  Hey, I was just curious of how he says that only gay poor people drive Hyundais.  Then how does he explain XM going to Toyotas?  I know them sumbitches are cheap.  Or not to mention Lexuses.  Yeah.  Or cars like Anthony's driving.  How about General Motors?  There you go.  Yeah.  Every Chevy and there you go.  They're all gay cars, I guess.  All right.  You guys are blown up here in Oklahoma City, man. 
[00:15:30]  And, I mean, I've given out at least 15 WOW stickers to people.  Wow, that's blowing up, all right.  Don't we love the Oklahoma City?  You know, this guy actually ran out of WOW stickers and tried to get some, and we couldn't  give them to him.  So, we're blowing up.  We're blowing up.  We've got 15 listeners in Oklahoma City.  That's the definition of blowing up in my book.  Jesus.  Do you understand how many people we used to broadcast to, sir?  Oh, sure, sure.  We're blowing up, all right.  I only have 15 on me. 
[00:16:00]  If I would have had more, I would have gave out more.  That's what I meant to say.  Just like Howie and his radios.  God, I'm an idiot.  Unlike the old lady, the old lady, well, the old lady is Howard and the gorilla over  there, you know.  We're not delusional.  We know that this is a slow build and getting better every single day.  I'm going to turn my car into a WOW car.  I got a black Mustang GT.  Yeah.  And I'm going to get that WOW airbrush across the hood.  I'm just punching out. 
[00:16:30]  That's Mark.  Oklahoma City.  Mark always comes up with something nice and intelligent, and then he just continues  and continues and continues.  That guy's been listening to us since day one.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  He is such a hypocritical ass.  He's trashing the guy's wife that she drives the BMW, that every car in his house isn't  a Hyundai.  What does Howard listen to when he leaves?  Does he be an XM subscriber?  It's been told to us that he definitely listens to this program because he has XM in his Escalade. 
[00:17:00]  Well, yeah.  And a lot of people start...  His Escalade, the vehicle he drives around in, does not have Sirius installed in it.  It has XM.  And it's been told to us by a bunch of people that he definitely takes a peek in a listen  to what we're doing over here.  And some people will point out that we're starting to get to him, which is nice.  Which is nice.  I do not want to start feeling sorry for him, though.  All right.  Mike in West Virginia.  What's up?  Mike?  Maybe Washington? 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Washington.  I'm sorry.  What's up, Mike?  Okay.  Hey, just to prove that Howard was raging, he's saying Hyundai was a piece of shit and  everything?  Yeah.  Hyundai tied for second with quality in the J.D. Power ratings right behind Honda.  They tied with Toyota.  Ah.  There you go.  More lies by him.  You know what, though?  People aren't buying the lies like they used to.  Brian in Alabama.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, man.  Hi.  I'm just coming off my shift here at the brand new 2005 Hyundai plant we just opened down 
[00:18:00]  here.  And he wants to sit there and say they were gay and all that.  But last year alone, we outsell BMW in a midsize sedan.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  So the quality is getting up there and Hyundai's coming alive back.  It's not like what you used to hear about them.  See?  I invented the gay car.  You tie a pink bandana around it.  Tell them, Fred.  I invented that in San Francisco.  Ass.  See, in his world, it's all about him. 
[00:18:30]  And that's the problem.  That's the problem the little doggy company's going to have.  This satellite radio is not about one show.  Would we love for XM to just push us and nothing else?  Of course.  Of course.  But that's not what's going to get the job done.  You've got to show the consumer out there that there's a lot going on.  A lot of different options.  That's what it's about.  The whole concept of paying for this is variety.  That's it.  Not one thing.  Same thing with cable television. 
[00:19:00]  It wasn't just one thing you're paying for.  You're paying for the variety of cable television.  And it's the same thing with satellite radio.  All right.  And Howie's got too big an ego, man.  Too big an ego to share the spotlight with anybody.  And that's not bullshit.  That is stuff we lived through.  We had to deal with it.  Working for the same company.  When Howie goes somewhere,  He wants to be the all-important guy that gets all the attention. 
[00:19:30]  And that's it.  That's why they're giving him how many channels?  I don't know.  They're giving him a few channels.  And he'll have say over who goes on those channels.  Mark my word, it will be no one of talent.  Because he doesn't want to be outshined by anybody.  The guy has an opportunity to put a lot of talent from around the country.  You know, pick and choose.  Try to find some.  But, you know, try to get some of the best talent.  He will absolutely not do that.  Because he's constantly threatened.  He's insecure. 
[00:20:00]  And he's going to fill it up with, you know, also rands.  Oh my God.  Perfect example.  The radio chick.  Yeah, there you go.  Because they have the same agent.  Come on.  A very safe show that's not going to do much of anything for that company.  So it already has begun.  How about getting some named people on there that really are proven and get listeners and are entertaining?  It's not going to happen.  Because it might outshine Howie.  That's the way he's always been.  And this isn't based on anything but experience on our part. 
[00:20:30]  We've been there.  We've seen how this asshole works.  Let's go to Chris in Cleveland.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, don't forget to thank him for that fucking free commercial he gave you all.  Yeah.  Of course.  Absolutely.  Of course.  He's only helping us out.  And I guess we're helping him out as well.  So there you go, Howard.  Not only that, when he goes as serious, you know how much they're going to fucking charge?  They're going to put him on a premium channel and it's going to cost you about $45 a month just to get him, just to pay his ass.  I have no idea what they got up their sleeve, but it doesn't look good. 
[00:21:00]  I'll tell you that much.  It doesn't look good.  All right.  Thanks, Chris.  Yeah, thanks.  All right.  Speaking of people that you end up feeling sorry for, right?  Remember, we pound on people and then it gets to the point where you feel sorry for them?  Yeah, you start feeling sorry for them.  You don't feel sorry for Don and Mike, do you?  No.  Okay, good.  I feel sorry for, I don't know, Don's family, having to live with him.  I feel sorry for that little dead dog in his driveway.  See, everyone had a big laugh when you and I got fired and Jimmy, of course, from our commercial radio show. 
[00:21:30]  And slowly but surely in the last two and a half years, I've watched all these stations we were on just go away.  Yeah.  And the latest is WBUF in Buffalo.  Oh, remember we had such a good time there, too.  And we like the gang over there, but they're no longer doing the hot talk format.  Talk.  Which means Don and Mike, bye-bye.  Bye-bye from Buffalo.  There's another market.  Bye-bye, Don.  Bye-bye, Mike.  Bye-bye.  But they had such a big laugh at our demise. 
[00:22:00]  Pushing you back further and further.  I can't even tell you how many stations they've been yanked off since, you know, we got fired.  Mm-hmm.  And now we're back slowly but surely moving our way to the top again.  And they're just fading away slowly, which is a lot worse than blowing yourself up.  How about we're here on a daily basis picking up new listeners every day?  That's a given.  We are getting new listeners and increasing our audience every single day.  Them, they're losing people every single day. 
[00:22:30]  That's it.  There goes a whole other city.  Bye-bye.  And you know what?  Add it to the pile.  No one even cares.  No one even cares.  You lose a city and it doesn't even make a fizzle.  You're fizzling out.  And no one even cares.  Let's go to Brian.  Hey, Brian.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good, man.  Hey.  Hey, if XM has taken such a beating, I just put it on a ticker and they're at over $28. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I know.  We're having a slow week.  I'm sorry for that, Brian.  Yeah, well, I checked it a few days ago and it was somewhere around $25.  And Sirius is only at $5.  Well, you know, Sirius will get a little bump at the end of the year, sure, and then it'll  go back down again.  Right, right.  Yeah, so, you know, you're really taking a beating by, you know, increasing your stock.  Because when it comes to a stock, the numbers just don't make sense as far as the company  goes.  The numbers, people, oh, what a, the stock won't go up to $29 anytime soon. 
[00:23:30]  I hope people realize that.  That'll take years if it ever happens.  If it ever.  They got too much stock out there is what it is.  Right.  They keep diluting it.  They're thinking about doing it again.  Let's go to Travis in Oklahoma City.  Travis, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, I'm Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  I was wondering, Howard obviously has no clue, or maybe he does, I don't know.  He was talking about the Hyundais being targeted towards the gay people and stuff. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  I was wondering, does anybody have any clue that Sirius Satellite Radio has the all-gay  programming channel?  Yeah, they have a channel dedicated to gay programming.  What, gay people can't have their own channels?  I don't really care, but it's just funny that he doesn't do his research as far as his  new company goes.  All right.  Punching out, boys.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Bye, mister.  Bye, mister.  Anyway, everyone's gearing up for me going over to Satellite.  And they're getting clobbered, XM. 
[00:24:30]  You know?  They're getting clobbered.  In fact, I was over at Satellite, I said, I want to give away some free radios.  They go, we can't even keep them in stock.  Oh, did you see that jerk?  I love that one. 
[00:25:00]  What an ass.  We're getting our asses kicked because...  Yeah, please explain this to me.  We're getting our asses kicked, XM.  Yeah.  Getting their asses kicked.  Yeah.  Because we have radios available to all the people that want them.  That are small and nice.  And obviously they're buying them because we're over 4 million subscribers. 
[00:25:30]  70% of the market.  70% of the market.  And we're getting our ass kicked because Howard couldn't get a free radio because they're all sold out.  I don't know.  Because they don't have radios for some reason.  Yeah.  I can't even understand it.  What a buffoon.  What a desperate-sounding buffoon.  Oh.  I can't wait to scream that at them next time I see them in the park jogging. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  That one's going to be fun.  I harass them all the time in the park.  It drives them nuts.  We're getting stopped.  It drives them nuts.  What do they tell them over there?  What are they telling them?  They can't show them facts.  They can't show them papers.  They can't show them Wall Street.  To prove that, you know, that they're kicking our ass.  Clobbering us.  Nothing but bad news has come out as far as those guys go.  This week.  You know, 70% of the market goes to XM. 
[00:26:30]  That's really bad news for your company, okay?  And then the other thing, their whole portable unit that they thought was going to set the market on fire is just a disaster.  And you're not even going to be able to listen to live programming until, what, they're saying spring of 2006.  Maybe.  And we're already working on, you know, second and even third generation of the portable.  And the first generation is great.  Well, the MiFi, yes.  The MiFi is amazing.  But then there's going to be two other portable units coming out very soon if they're not out there already. 
[00:27:00]  I think maybe June, are they saying?  I'm not positive, so.  Well, here's something else.  Of course, one of their big hires over there was Martha Stewart.  Yeah.  A lot of hoopla.  A lot of money being thrown at Martha Stewart over there.  Well, Martha, you're hired.  NBC confirms schedule for Apprentice spinoff starring Martha Stewart.  So now she's, along with everything else she's doing, she's going to be doing a TV show based on The Apprentice, and she's going to be hosting. 
[00:27:30]  How much time do you honestly think Martha Stewart's going to have for her serious satellite radio program?  How much time do you think she's really going to dedicate to doing that radio program when she now has a TV show  and everything else she's been involved in over the years, the cooking thing, her, what else does she do?  So the magazine, the house arrest. 
[00:28:00]  How much time do you, they throw money at these people for their names, not even thinking about what kind of quality they're putting on the station.  You know how hard it is to do a radio show day in and day out?  To put on a good radio show, it's very hard.  You can't just call it in.  To put on a shitty radio show?  Apparently that is simple.  Yeah.  You just tag a name on something and play some shit.  That's it.  Look at the Eminem thing.  You think Eminem is really concentrating on his radio show?  Or do you think he's concentrating on maybe putting out the next album or making another movie? 
[00:28:30]  Or fucking some bitch up?  I haven't heard anything about that.  Or raising a stupid kid that he doesn't shut up about.  I know.  Isn't that kid 18 by now?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, my baby girl.  Yo, she's 22.  Yo.  But I mean, they do that.  They hire these men.  What is it, Haley?  Haley.  Yeah, Haley had a real tough life.  She's four and she has a multi-millionaire father.  Yeah, that's a real tough life for a kid.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Very tough.  Let me tell you about tough.  Let me tell you about margarine and sugar sandwiches.  Breakfast a champion.  Yeah, real tough life.  Did she ever have to go to school with her lunch in a cement bag?  The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.  Oh, my God.  But I haven't heard anything.  And Tony Hawk, another one.  Well, I got to be honest.  I did hear the Tony Hawk show.  You did.  It was a complete disaster.  The guy's great at skateboarding.  Right.  It was a complete disaster.  But it's a little tough. 
[00:29:30]  People assume you can just get on the air and do the radio show.  Little known fact, I've done a little skateboarding in my day, okay?  I saw you on the half pipe.  All right.  I stunk.  Pairing it up.  But it's like me all of a sudden joining the skateboarding league.  There you go.  Whatever the fuck they call it.  And going, hey, good news.  Opie has joined the skateboarding league.  There you go.  Why?  Well, because he's Opie.  Right.  Sure.  You've got to work on skateboards.  If Tony Hawk, a good skater, could do radio, then a guy that does good radio could be a skateboarder. 
[00:30:00]  So that's what they do.  And then going back to the Eminem thing, I haven't heard word one about him and his radio show.  That thing went away fast.  Here's what they do.  They sign these names for huge amounts of money.  It gets the initial little spike of news and interest just because it's a celebrity name.  And then what happens?  It fades into nothingness. 
[00:30:30]  No one cares.  But the thing that does remain the same is Sirius is still pouring out huge amounts of money for these people.  For a name that got an initial little spike in popularity.  And I don't know how long that strategy is going to work.  Wall Street isn't very confident about that strategy.  They're writing things every day.  Go to MotleyFool.com, which is a big Wall Street website, and do a search on Sirius.  Look what Wall Street's saying about the company. 
[00:31:00]  They're screwing up on the numbers.  Let's go to Rob from Cablevision.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, doesn't Howard Stern kind of remind you of the Iraqi prime minister during the war when he was telling them that we were winning the war and buildings and shit were blowing up behind them?  Oh, the defense guy, yeah.  The minister of information.  Of information, okay.  I said he was.  That's right.  We're winning the war and buildings were blowing up behind them and shit.  No Americans are here.  The airport is secure. 
[00:31:30]  The airport is secure.  We have no enemy tanks.  We have pushed them all away.  Oh, he was a scream, that guy.  We have pushed them back.  I remember once he was on TV talking about the airport.  Yeah.  And people are asking him, aren't the Americans now in control of Baghdad airport?  He smiles.  He goes, no, no, no.  And then with his hands, he motioned.  He goes, we have pushed them back.  And he pushed.  And then made a sweeping motion with his hand.  And then swept them away. 
[00:32:00]  I'm laughing my ass off.  And there's our guys.  There's planes flying.  Yeah, they're at the airport.  No, no, no.  Howard's doing some similar stuff.  Howard's doing that.  We cannot even find radios.  We are clobbering the XM.  We are winning the war.  Oh, what a buffoon.  That is funny.  Oh, I can't wait to see the photoshops.  Oh, boys, go to work.  Minister of Information and Howie. 
[00:32:30]  He really is becoming a parody of himself.  Oh, remember when he had credibility years ago?  It is...  No, I will not feel sorry for him.  I will not fall into that.  Remember years ago?  The credibility he had?  The power he wielded?  And when he used to goof on people like Chevy Chase, you couldn't tune away.  It was amazing radio.  The Sam Kinison fight over the Bon Jovi thing back in the 80s. 
[00:33:00]  Remember that stuff?  And you'd listen and hear him goofing on people and go...  And as he's pointing things out, you'd think, wow, that person is a hypocrite.  Or, God, what an idiot.  What a no-sense-of-humor asshole this guy is.  And he is now that guy.  He is completely turned into that guy.  Oh, I will not feel sorry.  I will not feel sorry.  That's your new mantra?  It has to be.  Joe in Jersey, what's up? 
[00:33:30]  Hey, guys, the only reason that Siri doesn't have any radios in this truck is because they  can only fit one or two in a truckload.  And the truck's got to go back.  Hoist another one up on.  You ever see them pulling, like, the back of the tractor trailers off at Port Newark?  Yeah, yeah.  That's actually how they lift Sirius satellite radios off the ships.  Yeah, they're sitting out there on the decks of the ships.  That's right, man. 
[00:34:00]  Awful.  Tony Hawk and Martha Stewart.  Yuck.  Let's go to Ryan in New York City.  Ryan, what's up?  Hi, fellas.  Big-ass cart member, 10341.  Hi, Cupcake.  Hi, mister.  The assault on the media this morning.  Yeah.  That guy, from what I know I understand, was Danny.  Most disturbing face ever.  It was awesome.  We've got to get Danny in here.  We've got to get the whole gang in here.  We were responsible for that one, of course.  We love these assaults on the media.  It's been a little dry lately, I've got to admit. 
[00:34:30]  We just love it because we just look like idiots and asses.  We're all in the office getting ready for another fine Opie and Anthony program.  And I've got to give the assist to Ricky, believe it or not.  Oh.  Ricky, who we ride really hard.  He must have screwed up and it backfired and worked.  Well, all of a sudden, Ricky comes in and goes, guys, there's a live truck on Broadway and  57th.  And we all look at Ricky like, oh, good.  And then we're like, well, Danny, why don't you go check that out?  Like, you know, why don't you just spend two minutes just in case? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  But sure enough, there was a live truck and they were doing a report that it was going  to be a tourist with a camcorder or something.  Right.  Oh, it's a news truck.  So Danny takes off.  Not really confident, right, Danny, because it came from Ricky?  Well, I was confident that it would be there.  I just figured it wasn't going to be happening right away.  So I figured I'd have some time.  They were over at the Newsweek building over there doing a little story on that Koran desecration  thing that Newsweek was reporting.  Yeah.  Well, now they're taking that back, right? 
[00:35:30]  They're actually not taking back the fact that it happened or not.  They're retracting the story and saying that they just don't have credible information.  They still say that it happened, but their source wasn't credible, so they're retracting  the story.  And what everybody else wants is, you know, a full retraction and apology.  Yeah, so people stop dying.  How many people have died?  You know what, though?  This is ridiculous.  I did a little thinking on this last night.  Heard the story.  If a soldier, or even a group of soldiers, is using the Koran and desecrating it to interrogate 
[00:36:00]  people, whatever your own opinion is, you could see that as wrong, you know, you shouldn't  do it, whatever.  I'm just saying, okay, people say that's wrong, it's wrong.  Why, then, are people protesting against the United States like it's our country's policy  policy to desecrate the Koran and flush it down the toilet to interrogate people, when  they always, constantly, the Muslims are constantly turning around and saying, look, a few people 
[00:36:30]  are committing violence in the name of our religion, but the majority of us don't believe  in it.  It's a peaceful religion, yet there's people lopping off heads, and they only turn around  and say, well, it's not us.  It's not everybody.  It's a small minority of people that are doing this.  Well, why can't anybody else just say, well, this is a small minority of soldiers that  are desecrating the Koran to get that?  It's not a state policy.  It's not the United States' policy.  But the second it happens, they turn around, Bush did this, America is evil, they're desecrating 
[00:37:00]  the Koran.  Meanwhile, they're doing the same goddamn thing, only it's a lot worse.  It ain't flushing some papers down the toilet.  It's lopping people's heads off.  All these motherfuckers do is burn American flags and burn effigies of every president.  Fuck them.  But it's not.  No, it's a peaceful religion, Jimmy.  Ugh.  It's not.  It's a few bad apples.  But when a few, you know, bad apples desecrate the Koran, it's a conspiracy that goes up to 
[00:37:30]  the presidency, and it's a whole United States policy.  Bunch of just fucking running around the street yelling with flags burned.  Get a hold of yourselves.  Act like humans.  Please.  Stop it.  It's impossible for them.  So anyway, in front of the Newsweek building, they were doing a whole story on that.  So Danny went down there, and...  By the way, they'll be there all day, if anybody's in the area of Broadway in 57th.  Sure, that's a big story.  I would love to hit them up again, because they were not happy with Danny. 
[00:38:00]  By the way, Islam is kicking the shit out of Christianity.  I went to get a Koran, and there were none in stock.  And there were so many Bibles there.  I'm like, wow, this must just be a...  Islam is getting clobbered.  Oh, we're getting clobbered.  Clobbered.  Okay, Beeb.  Oh, God.  You've got to clobbered.  Maybe, Howard, maybe you should have waited a couple days on that ridiculous statement.  Maybe you should have thought that over in your head, mulled it over a little bit, a couple  of seconds. 
[00:38:30]  Well, I'm sure he doesn't read the papers anymore.  Why would he?  He just calls in his show, so why would he actually go through the papers and maybe get  show material?  He would have seen in just about every New York paper that they're talking about, XM  reaching 4 million subs and having 70% of the market.  So he chooses yesterday to be the day that he says that we stink.  What an ass.  That's just beautiful.  Anyway, so Danny goes out there.  We turn on Channel 4 in the office, and we're all just staring at the TV. 
[00:39:00]  The report's going down, and we don't think he's going to make it.  And all of a sudden, in the glass behind the reporter, because he's on an angle, so you  can see the glass of a building.  Yeah.  You see Danny running.  You see his, like, image in the glass running, and we're thinking, oh, my God, he's going  to make it.  And then he slows down just in time with what?  A cigarette in your mouth, a cup of coffee in the other hand, and A.O.P. and Anthony spread  the virus, huge, you know, cutouts.  The placards, yeah, with our stupid cartoon faces on them.  Yeah.  And he stops right behind the reporter and just stands there and gives this evil smile, 
[00:39:30]  like, yeah, motherfuckers, I got you.  With a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and a cup of coffee in his hand, and a sign  in the other hand, he just stops right behind her and smiles right into the camera.  I thought that was a bum.  I seriously thought it was a bum.  Oh, God.  Come on.  You weren't wrong.  Classic.  You can barely see the sign, though.  Nah, you can definitely see it. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, you can see the spread the virus, Opie and Anthony real fast.  It was definitely a fine assault on the media.  I'm thinking we might need smaller signs, though, because they really, you know, go in for tight  shots with these reporters a lot of times.  She was so pissed.  The new shot sign.  She was?  Oh, dude.  Yeah, what happened after the camera went off?  She stared at me.  You ever see Sleepers with Brad Pitt and, uh...  Yeah.  When they're chasing the hot dog guy, and they're just staring at each other from across  the street, and she had the same look, and that hot dog just, ooh, just looking at me. 
[00:40:30]  Pissed.  Yeah, they don't like that.  It fucks up their resume tape.  They usually use these things for, like, you know, when they lose their job or try to  move on, they put a whole collection of these little things together.  An important story like that, it's a big story, so she would probably have included that  in her resume, and they're standing screwing it up.  Gonna have to go to ILM and have you digitally removed from the shot.  Like, big stupid Kool-Aid stuff.  Gonna have put Jar Jar Binks in its place or something.  That was a fine assault on the media. 
[00:41:00]  It certainly was.  Very funny.  We were all watching The Office.  We definitely encourage this.  Oh, yeah.  It's just fun to watch, and of course, it helps out the show.  It's our guerrilla marketing tactic.  You become a star for a day, and we have you down here, and you can hang and check out  the show, whatever.  Yeah.  Just don't hurt the reporters.  Was it a conscious decision not to say anything?  You know, I don't even know.  I was expecting an O&A party rock or something.  I was going to also.  I mean, I saw the light was still on, but I saw her flipping through her little pad,  so I didn't even think they were still alive.  Oh.  So I just kind of held there, you know, stood there with a sign, not even knowing if this 
[00:41:30]  was actually going on live.  And luckily, I got the call afterwards from Travis, and he let me know that it was a success  indeed.  You gave us a huge laugh around 6.30, 6.40 this morning.  We're all just applauding and laughing and pointing at the TV.  And I would gather this is going to be up on Foundry?  Yeah, foundrymaison.com.  It might be up real soon, or opianthony.com as well.  ASAP.  Danny, bravo.  Thank you.  Good job.  Thank you.  You're officially in the lead.  You are.  Oh.  You're a little better than Nathaniel today. 
[00:42:00]  Trumped again, birthday boy.  Oh, it's his birthday today?  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday, Nathaniel.  How old are you, fan?  27.  Oh, happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  All right.  Look at him in there.  What is he doing at the helm?  Why are you at the con?  Because I think Derek has to step out or something.  What a great birthday present they give you.  To put some in control of everything.  Yep.  And then Danny gets to show me up, and it's awesome. 
[00:42:30]  And it's awesome indeed.  All right.  Ryan, thank you.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  See you.  I'm glad you saw that this morning, because it made us all chuckle.  Let's go to Dan on Long Island.  Dan, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  We were talking about last Friday, that corny headline, West Slide Story.  Yeah, West Slide Story for the rock slide.  Yeah, did you see today's post for the Coran thing?  Holy Shiite.  Yeah, holy Shiite.  And there's a picture of Newsweek magazine in a toilet bowl. 
[00:43:00]  This is very close to a curse word on the cover of the New York Post.  Yeah, I mean, if the FCC is so big on things that are implied now,  you can't imply certain things like by beeping or using the letters.  Yeah.  How can they get away with this?  Yeah.  So any child could pass by any news stand and see that and get affected.  The New York paper is, I mean, it's just amazing to look at the covers every day.  New York Post has Holy Shiite.  Newsweek retracts his deadly toilet tail.  They also have on the cover Israel in crisis over Madonna. 
[00:43:30]  Does anyone know what that's about?  There's some bullshit going on about somebody was supposed to hook up Madonna with some kind of interview,  and it got into the whole political hierarchy of Israel.  I'm not sure of the whole story, but it's a non-story.  Why does she have to inject herself into the Middle East?  She's so important.  Just stay here on the Upper West Side, you dull twat.  It's Madonna.  It's very important.  She traveled over there and broke her some type of peace.  Esther, her name is.  I think her Israeli name or whatever the name, the Kabbalah name is, Esther. 
[00:44:00]  It's very important with her little bracelet made of yarn.  Oh, she's just atrocious.  And then also on the Post, Star Wars zapped my love life.  What the hell is that about?  That's some guy who lost his check over his affinity for Star Wars.  He makes costumes.  Yeah, they can find them.  And lightsabers.  He's got like ten different lightsabers and costumes to be Jedi and Darth Vader costume he has. 
[00:44:30]  And he's got tattoos, all kinds of Star Wars tattoos all over his body.  And he even has Teflon inserts underneath one of the tattoos of the eyes of a Tusken Raider.  So they pop out like the real character's eyes kind of pop out.  He did that to one of his tattoos.  Wow. 
[00:45:00]  A true...  And he says he's not a geek.  Because those Star Trek people, now they're geeks.  But he's, you know, he's cool.  He's cool.  Well, his wife doesn't think he's cool.  No.  Can we get him on the phone?  Is that possible?  Took off.  Maybe.  He lives on Long Island.  Yeah, we should try to look this guy up and get him on the phone today.  Him and his, I guess, was supposed to be his wife, his gal pal.  Um, we're talking about having kids and he wants to name one of the kids Anakin. 
[00:45:30]  And she says no.  Yeah, here's the story really fast.  Eric Negron has emblazoned most of his body with Star Wars tattoos.  Sleeps between Star Wars sheets.  He has Star Wars sheets?  You know, that's probably a collector's item.  Original Star Wars sheets?  Fuck, man.  I understand hobbies and stuff.  And if you're into Star Wars and you want to get the sheets, that's fine.  But maybe you put those in a closet or something.  Maybe you break them out to show your other Star Wars friends.  There you go. 
[00:46:00]  You don't sleep on them.  You don't sleep between the Star Wars sheets.  And even lost his tenure.  Natalie's apartment in wet dreams and splooging all over them.  And even lost his tenure living girlfriend to the dark side of the Force.  She said it was me or Star Wars.  My reaction was Star Wars.  Yeah.  Yeah, girls have cooties anyway.  Well, he's right, though.  He said, actually, he said, I'm not a geek.  I'm a douchebag.  After your fellow sex is stupid. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  He hates when people call him geeks.  A geek, yeah.  He doesn't consider himself a geek.  He thinks this is really cool.  All right.  He's the guy that has lightsaber fights with his friends.  Come over the house and get all dressed up.  It's almost like those guys that dress up like EverQuest characters in real life and fight.  What is that called? 
[00:47:00]  I forgot.  The LARPers.  I was going to say LARPers.  They're LARPers.  Live action role playing.  All right.  And they dress up like the characters.  And he does the same thing.  Why can't any of them have a...  I wouldn't mind it so much if it was like an affinity for The Shining.  I couldn't take it anymore.  Every time a Negro came over, he'd bury an action in his chest.  Oh, God.  This gets better.  He's a good guy.  Don't get me wrong.  But he's definitely obsessed as Satan or Satin. 
[00:47:30]  His ex there.  She's also a tattoo artist.  You could see which was top priority and it wasn't me.  He wanted to have a Star Wars wedding.  If we had a kid, he wanted to name it after a Star Wars character.  We didn't have a car, but we had a life-sized Han Solo car right in the living room.  Yeah.  His table, his actual dining room table is a replica of Han Solo encased in carbonite. 
[00:48:00]  And you would have to eat off that, I guess.  And he doesn't want to be called a geek.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I'm just reading on here.  Well, while you're reading on, Opie...  Yeah, go ahead.  I got a plug here.  Big Kev presents Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith.  Wednesday, May 18th, 10 p.m.  It's at the AMC Clifton Commons, Route 3 East, Clifton, New Jersey.  They're going to have a stickers trivia for prizes, costume prizes. 
[00:48:30]  And it culminates with the 12.01 a.m. premiere of the film.  So join Big Kev, sponsored by Collectible...  Collect...  I should have read that first.  CollectibleBitsBox.com.  CollectibleBitsBox.com.  Right.  Jesus, that is hard to say.  And Time Warp Comics and Games in Cedar Grove, New Jersey.  There you go.  Wow.  Now, we are going to need some recorders at that goddamn event. 
[00:49:00]  When is it, Ant?  That's tomorrow.  Wednesday.  At midnight.  May 18th, 10 p.m.  It starts.  Can I get into the premiere of Star Wars?  At AMC Clifton Commons.  At midnight?  Oh, I haven't seen the first two from the new series.  Shit.  No, I just watched the third.  No, you might be a little confused.  You don't have them on the DVD?  I bought them.  I watched part of the one, and I saw Jar Jar, and I turned it off.  I'm like, this...  You've got to get over the Jar Jar things.  I know, it's very difficult.  But you've got to watch both of them before you go see the third. 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  You have to.  Anthony, this continues.  Yeah.  He is closing in on his ultimate goal to make latex masks of all the aliens from the cantina scene in the original film.  Everyone has a goal.  I just can't get past the cantina scene, he confessed.  Who can?  Having attended last week's charity screening of Revenge of the Sith, which he plans to see 100 times or so this summer,  he says, I could die tomorrow, happy man, since I've seen the last movie.  I'm complete right now.  Good news for this guy.  He's got a new girlfriend. 
[00:50:00]  She's pregnant.  The baby's due in two months.  Yeah.  And he wants to name the little fella Anakin.  Kill yourself.  But he doesn't want to be called a geek.  You know, I was playing...  When it first came out, I was playing Star Wars Galaxies.  It's a role-playing game like EverQuest, but set in the Star Wars universe.  I was a bounty hunter.  Okay.  Yeah.  And there's a cantina in the Mos Eisley section of the game. 
[00:50:30]  So, I go in there, and I realize I was not long for the game, because even I, and I'll consider myself a geek, you know,  especially as far as computer games go.  So, I walk in there, there's two characters that are being played by other people somewhere in the country, obviously younger, and they're talking to each other, and you can see their dialogue, you know, over their heads.  And one goes to the other, oh, my God, I can't believe we're here.  We're in the cantina.  Yeah, this is so cool. 
[00:51:00]  Like, they were so thrilled to be in this virtual cantina space, and I just, I just kind of walked out and never really went back to the game.  That was it.  This cantina scene, by the way, almost ruined Star Wars.  It stunk.  It was, uh...  That big elephant playing a horn, it was atrocious.  Well, you gotta think, also, the special effects back then were not very good.  Agreed.  Yeah.  Agreed. 
[00:51:30]  But Boba Fett was cool.  I guess in the second one, there was a lot, whatever the first one was, fuck, now it was.  The first one was cool.  I liked the ships were very good.  Great, they were great.  Yeah, the effects on the Death Star were, you know, they were okay for the time.  They were great.  I mean, when, you know, the X-Wings go into the trench, famous scene, it's amazing.  And, you know, for the time, it was great.  But, yeah, some of the aliens, very lame.  Rubbery hands, like fake rubber gloves they were wearing, but that's all he had to wear. 
[00:52:00]  Even Jabba the Hutt was awful.  What made the thing interesting was C-3PO, R-22 was fine, but Vader, obviously, could  be the best bad guy in the history of films.  See, that was some great stuff.  Chewbacca was actually very well done costuming, and Boba Fett, and all the, that's what it  should have been.  I don't think they needed all the rubber-headed alien things going on.  Boogity, boogity, boogity, you know, a little marketing, you fucking wee-chid idiot.  That was just a cute little scene.  For the kids.  Stunk.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  The elephant, oh, kids have to have it. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, all right, now this guy's very pissed off that we're making fun of Star Wars.  David in Tennessee, what's up, David?  Yeah, hello, I was just wondering what type of show this is, where you constantly make  fun of Star Wars, for my 10-year-old little boy to hear.  I am a huge fan, sir.  No, listen to me.  My little son told me to turn on this channel.  Oh, my God, listen to how phony this is.  You what, sir?  With this phony phone call, you what?  My son told me to turn on this channel, so I did, when I'm driving into school, and I  heard the Star Wars talk, and then I heard about Sheik, and Jimmy on Sheik, and everything. 
[00:53:00]  All right, so I suggest you find a pole and head for it.  We have no time for a phony phone call today.  George in West Virginia, what's up?  What's up, dude?  There's some fucking douchebag critics on yesterday talking about how Lucas intentionally made  episode three in comparison to the Bush administration.  Yeah, that's another one.  Like, the rise of the empire is somehow reminiscent of how the Bush administration came to be. 
[00:53:30]  Well, I'm sure after the movie's out a while, someone will write a nice little article on  that.  They have, yeah.  We'll have some fun with that.  I've read some articles already tying the two together.  But if you look, it could be, you could say it's like any war that's going on, or any  government stuff.  Yeah, Lucas said himself, he's actually comparing it to the Vietnam War or something.  Really?  Well, the original one came out in 1977, so I wonder, you know, when Darth Vader smashed  Obi-Wan Kenobi, was that a Jimmy Carter, Shaw of Iran reference? 
[00:54:00]  You fucking idiots.  Punch it out, boys.  I like the scene where Senator Palpatine gets a blowjob in the Oval Office.  That's a great one.  Shannon in Ohio.  What's up, Shannon?  Good morning.  Morning.  Oh, a girl.  Nice.  It's a girl.  Hi, Shannon in Ohio.  Good morning, Jimmy.  My husband and I just recently bought a house, and while we were looking for houses...  Yeah.  I'm sorry, what did I say? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, nothing.  Husband.  Husband.  Oh, sorry.  That's hurtful.  We live in a fantasy world on this program.  That's right.  So all you fine ladies that call in, you can just make believe you don't have that.  You're all single college girls.  You're all single hot cheerleaders that like to frolic in fountains and malls.  Shower together.  Instead of a husband, just refer to it as the guy with the huge cock that I live with.  He probably would love that, too.  So it's this guy with the huge cock that I live with. 
[00:55:00]  We went to look at a house, and the guy who was showing us the house, bathroom, bedroom,  whatever, we get to the basement.  There's this door.  It has, like, keep out signs on it.  It's, like, under the stairs, basically.  And I'm looking at my husband, like, we're going to find dead bodies in there.  This guy was really weird.  And he's like, okay, now, before you go into this room, I just want you to know you're not,  you can't judge me on this room.  And don't make your decision about whether or not to find a house on this room.  We walk in.  There's, like, a six-foot replica of the Starship Enterprise or whatever it's called 
[00:55:30]  hanging from the ceiling and his Stormtrooper outfit in the corner and all this Star Wars  and Star Trek crap laying around.  And my husband sort of jokingly said, yeah, really.  My husband sort of jokingly said, oh, does this stuff come with the house when we buy it?  Ha, ha, ha.  And the guy just looked at us with this dead stare and went, no, no.  What did my wife tell you? 
[00:56:00]  No.  None of this stuff is called the house.  Oh, he was very upset by the thought that he might have to give it up, huh?  But he gave us this death, yeah.  We were a little concerned.  And then my husband commented on the, he had the, what, Captain Kirk, whatever his name is,  biography.  Yeah.  And the guy just went off on a tirade about what an asshole he is and doesn't appreciate  his fans.  And he had tried to get an autograph and, yeah.  You should have killed him. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I really think he might have been buried in the basement if he was not alive today.  Excuse me, Captain Kirk, could you sign my copy of Catcher in the Rye?  Thank you.  All right, Shanna, thank you.  Thanks.  I don't mind a guy like she's talking about, a guy with an obsession for a film.  If you love the movie and you got part of your basement dedicated to it or whatever.  There you go.  Fine.  No one's saying you can't have a hobby that kind of takes you away from your life.  I mean, we all have them.  But when you start getting the tattoos and when you try to bang your woman and you have  to go down on her and look at an Ewok because it's on your sheets. 
[00:57:00]  There's something emotionally wrong with you.  You're an ass.  Let's go to Mark on Long Island.  Mark?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  I just want to say, Return of the Jedi, I would have loved to see more Ewoks die.  That was the gayest scene in the whole fucking movie.  It was atrocious.  Ruined that movie.  It was atrocious.  That idiot was marketing towards children and not caring about the integrity of his film.  Yep.  What was the noise they would make?  I don't even know.  Like little hamburglers? 
[00:57:30]  Little woogly, cute characters?  Maybe he never cared about the integrity of his film or films.  I hear he tied it up very well.  Maybe it was all about making a lot of money and marketing toward kids.  Anthony brought up something just before the show started today.  The new Star Wars movie is going to make so much more money just marketing-wise than actual ticket sales.  The whole series has made more money in marketing than it has in the actual sale of tickets for the movie itself. 
[00:58:00]  More in action figures, food restaurant endorsement deals, clothing, bed sheets, things like that have made more money than the film itself.  Well, I mean, the first one, though, again, at least it made, like, the stormtroopers were phenomenal.  Yeah.  The costumes made perfect sense.  Like, one of the main characters was, you know, Peter Cushing.  Yeah.  Who was, you know, just great.  No one figured that would be a little character with a gray hat, that scumbag.  So, at least to me, the movie made much more sense.  But then they started to get into all this shit that was geared up to kids. 
[00:58:30]  But maybe the fans took it to that next level and made this, you know, movie legendary and serious and all that.  Maybe Lucas had it in his mind the whole time.  Ah, I'm going to throw a movie out there for kids and adults and have a little fun here.  Empire Strikes Back was a great movie.  Yeah.  I thought that one was really, really good.  It wasn't packed with stupid, cute little aliens and things like that.  But then the Jedi was, ugh. 
[00:59:00]  The Ewoks.  The Ewoks.  And then he takes his helmet off and he looks like Bob Kelly without the goatee.  What happened?  I don't know.  Darth Vader hurt his leg playing football.  Mmm.  That cheeseburger you do not want.  I do not want that cheeseburger.  Those fries give Yoda.  Here, have my fries.  Your drink desire you not.  The Diet Pepsi I do want.  Want you not.  Do not want. 
[00:59:30]  This summer, grab a Diet Pepsi and see Star Wars Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.  Wow, you could even make Diet Pepsi sound cool.  The market.  Grab a Diet Pepsi and see Star Wars Episode 3.  You see it everywhere.  Oh.  There's Stormtroopers and Yoda and Darth Vader selling all kinds of crap on TV.  It really kind of does take away from the evilness of Vader when he's staring at the Burger King King and they're both breathing at each other. 
[01:00:00]  I actually got that.  It really does take away from the evilness.  That was a commercial?  Evilness.  Yes.  It doesn't work for radio, unfortunately, because it's more of a visual.  It's a visual.  They're staring at each other down.  I think this is the audio.  Well, this is the commercial.  They're just breathing at each other.  They're just staring at each other and breathing. 
[01:00:30]  What a great sound that is.  What a great evil sound.  Genius.  That is it.  Please use your destiny at BK.  That is it.  And to use James Earl Jones' voice, that's just that big guy's name was David Prowse.  I don't think he's doing it now.  Yeah.  Interesting bit of trivia.  If anyone ever saw Clockwork Orange?  Yeah.  The big bodybuilder who carries down the guy in the wheelchair?  Uh-huh.  That's Darth Vader.  That's the guy in the Vader suit.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  That Burger King mascot is just beyond creepy, too.  What is the mascot?  The guy wakes up in bed and turns over, and he's just staring at him.  It's just like, how do you describe it?  It's a king, obviously.  Yeah, it was the Burger King guy with the big head.  But there's no facial expressions.  He's in a costume.  Because it's just a mask that doesn't really move.  And he just kind of sits there and stares at people.  It's very frightening.  It's really, really creepy.  I don't know who he is.  There is nothing new under the sun.  But, under the small, green fourth moon of Yavin, there is quite a different story. 
[01:01:30]  Director George Lucas and 20th Century Fox present Star Wars.  Luke Skywalker is on a daring mission to rescue a beautiful princess.  And all he needs is a little help from his friends.  Bob Solo, Space Pirate, and Chewie, his giant Wookiee.  C-3PO, Human Relations Cyborg, and his counterpart R2-B2. 
[01:02:00]  And the mysterious Jedi Knight.  Never before in the history of movies has so much time and technology been spent just for fun.  He just ripped off The Wizard of Oz.  That's all that is.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is an old commercial.  Yeah, that's from 1977. 
[01:02:30]  And there's really no focus on Darth Vader.  It just shows you he probably didn't plan on it being the massive hit that it was.  Yeah.  That was insightful of me.  Goofy, goofy space movie.  Let's go back to Washington.  Second call from Washington already.  Josh.  Good morning.  Morning, Josh.  Washington.  Morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, ONA.  Good morning, Josh.  Thanks for calling the program.  Not a problem.  I'll tell you what.  I get more pussy because I'm a Star Wars fan than you might think.  Really?  Yes, absolutely.  I've invited girls to come over.  I say, hey, let's, you know, I got all five so far on DVD. 
[01:03:00]  I said, yeah, come over, hang out, watch a movie.  Next thing you know, I'm banging them on the couch, and now I'm here, just on my TV,  and I don't know what it is.  I don't know if girls are getting turned on by it, but.  They're both.  No, all the phones just went dead.  All the phones went dead.  Why?  That seems to be the latest phone problem.  It doesn't happen a lot.  Oh, my God, you guys.  But it just has to happen once.  Oh, my God, I'm going to have.  We had a lot of phone callers there we would have gone to. 
[01:03:30]  There were some great phone calls just standing by waiting.  It's okay, Opie, watch.  Oh, my God.  Call back.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  I'll call back.  Are we working on that problem?  Because that's the latest one.  That's a biggie.  That's a biggie.  Because it just wipes out the entire bank of phones.  Oh, my God.  When you do a radio show, you're just looking at the screen going, wow, this is easily 20 minutes of very good radio.  Oh, poof.  Oh, no problem.  We're such experts.  We'll just make it up.  Look at all the calls, though, now.  Yeah, well, now it's a whole scramble of new people. 
[01:04:00]  Could have been some of the other people with very good calls.  Oh, my God.  New people, hang up, let the old people call back.  Oh, God.  Well.  And by the way, the guy who says he gets late, what do you do, bring a chick home when she falls asleep, you're a raper, you're a psychopath?  No chick that wants to bang is going to come over and watch Star Wars and bang.  It doesn't work that way.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup.  Our show is popular because none of the phone lines are lit.  See, if you had a bunch of the phone lines lit.  Yeah, can I hear that again?  We're clobbering other phone lines. 
[01:04:30]  People are like, why do you spend so much time on him?  Because he's so silly and out of touch and delusional that it just makes us laugh really hard.  I just don't get that thing where you walk in and you say to the president of the company, hand me some radios.  I'd love to.  All out.  All out.  We're doing so well.  Which one do you want to hear again?  The really good one?  Yeah, I want to hear that.  The one where he mentions us is pretty funny, too. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, just go with that one.  Anyway, everyone's gearing up for me going over to Satellite.  And they're getting clobbered, I guess.  They're getting clobbered.  In fact, I was over at Satellite, I said, I want to give voice from free radios.  They go, we can't even keep them in stock.  More brilliant commentary by Robin from the dunk tank.  Can't even keep them in stock.  They don't have any.  Shut up.  Oh, you useless. 
[01:05:30]  You're useless.  I think the term Mel used when he requested them is going like hotcakes.  Hotcakes.  My God, man.  All right, why don't we take a break, Ant?  I want to do, I'd like to take a peek at Wacky Radio today.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't want to do it the way we've done in the past because it kind of fails miserably,  but maybe we could take a peek at one or two shows today.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  That means we're counting on the listeners to set it up perfectly.  Oh, boy.  That could be trouble.  All right.  Well, we'll put a time limit on the bit.  If it stinks, we're out.  We're out!  Also, Ant, we got more sex talk with Sue Johansson.  I can't get enough of this lady.  She is something else.  Sexy old bag.  We did the how to explain explicit images to a child, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Prehistoric vibrators.  We could get into that with her. 
[01:06:30]  Toilet terror.  Can you catch an STD from a toilet seat?  Only crabs.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I've heard that those are actually possible to catch, but an STD, I don't care what she says.  No.  And if you're getting raped by a washroom attendant at a popular Manhattan night spot, perhaps  you could catch an STD off a toilet seat.  Did that happen?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll get into that story, too.  And also, Anthony.  Some drunk teen was in there.  Underage.  All drunk.  Went to go to the bathroom.  One of these washroom attendants.  One of these animals. 
[01:07:00]  Followed her in.  The washroom attendant.  He raped her.  That's how that Star Wars guy gets laid all the time.  He dresses up like a stormtrooper and attacks him, and they can't identify him.  I don't know.  He had a laser gun and a white hat.  Helmet.  And a little news tease for when we get back, Anthony.  Anthony, let me adjust your gi.  That's a very funny story that made us giggle in the back office.  Let me adjust your gi. 
[01:07:30]  All on the way.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A violence.  Pepper, what's up, buddy?  What's going down?  Pepper Keenan from COC.  Do I have to explain what happened on Friday?  Yeah, we were really hoping for you to come in.  You know, we haven't seen you in a while.  And next thing I know, like Ben is handing us a note saying Pepper is missing somewhere in New York City.  They busted down his room, the door to his room in his hotel, and they saw some, like, chick in his bed. 
[01:08:00]  And that's all they knew.  You know who that chick was?  Huh?  That was me, face down.  The stupid lady assumed that I was the woman, I guess, because of my beautifully long hair.  That's awful, man.  Do you have a hairless ass, too?  It was me.  And I had made the mistake of flying to New York and leaving my phone charger at home, so my freaking cell phone was dead.  So you didn't wake up for our interview or whatever. 
[01:08:30]  You were going to come over here.  I think you were staying right across the street.  Yeah, I was ready to go, man.  And then all of a sudden, they went into panic mode and what?  I mean, they were calling friends of mine in New Orleans to get, like, running buddies in Manhattan's phone number.  Oh, shit.  It was hilarious.  And, you know, I had been out in Manhattan the night before.  We were running all over the place, and I was ready to go.  But the lady, security woman or whatever, assumed that I was a woman, obviously thinking that some guy with beautiful blonde hair wouldn't be the singer for COC. 
[01:09:00]  Jeez.  Did you have the, uh, was the sheet pulled up on you?  I had no idea, man.  I'm lucky I wasn't button naked on the floor.  Well, maybe then she'd know it wasn't a chick.  She really probably would have thought it was a woman.  There's a woman with a cock in this room.  That wasn't sounding good on Friday.  That was funny, man.  Everybody was completely in the panic mode, but I was up and at them.  Well, it didn't help that a national talk show was basically saying that Pepper's missing.  Because that's the info we got. 
[01:09:30]  Pepper's missing and there's some chick naked in his bed.  There's a dead chick in the bed.  Yeah.  I think at one point we did say that.  She wasn't moving.  We're like, ah, it's rock and roll.  What are you going to do?  We've seen this story before.  You're right.  We're down that muddy road.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Just how deep do you believe Will you bite the hand that feeds  Will you chew a careless breeze Can you get up off your knees 
[01:10:00]  Are you brave enough to see Do you want to change it  Ah, you're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio  The phones were jammed and then they went away again  Yeah, apparently they're changing out some equipment is what I heard  How long is that going to take? 
[01:10:30]  About three minutes ago, four minutes ago, I was told ten minutes  We need the phones today  Oh, phones. What do we need phones for?  It's not like we're a very interactive show with the audience  Some days we go to the phones more than others  And today we're heavy on the phones and they go away  We were talking about something the audience really wants to talk about  Not like personal stories or anything 
[01:11:00]  It was something everyone could share and enjoy  Well, you know, the listener's input is very important to this show  No matter how stupid it is  Well, even that's important because then we get to mock them  I still have instant feedback, though  Thank God  Hear the latest on Ellen DeGeneres?  This is a fucked up story  Page six?  Uh, Daily News, actually  Ellen comes out as an abuse survivor  Survivor? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, do we have that music?  She's a survivor  The behind-the-scenes crew is all messed up today, too  We're short of guys, so now Eric's in there  Nathaniel's doing something else  And they're trying to get the phones working  Danny's face is pretty funny when the phones go out  It just goes pop  And he puts his arms up like, it wasn't me  Like, I didn't do it  I saw it  It happened  But I had nothing to do with it  It's like, we all saw the same thing 
[01:12:00]  But I had nothing to do with it  Alright, here we go  A survivor story  Yes  Ellen DeGeneres  Surviving abuse  I'm starting to think everyone has been touched as a kid  I mean  I don't remember being touched  I think everyone has  Aww  It has taken 30 years, Anthony  But Ellen DeGeneres  Is finally talking about the molestation  She says she endured at the hands of her stepfather  Ooh  Always the stepfather  Yep  The comic says she was 17 when her mother, Betty 
[01:12:30]  Breast cancer and mastectomy  Wait, Betty  Oh, I got it  Okay  The comic says she was 17 when her mother, Betty's breast cancer and mastectomy  Gave Betty's third husband an excuse to examine Ellen  What the fuck did I mess up now?  Nothing, actually  You actually didn't mess up  Jimmy looks over  I think it's just the awfulness of the story  It really is a horrible story  Oh, I know  I'm not doing this as a laugh  I know  But I'm giggling  Oh, okay  You're giggling 
[01:13:00]  I thought I messed up  No  I thought I messed up another word  Wherever you are  Surviving  Alright, so basically  Ellen's mom there had breast cancer and a mastectomy  And her third husband  Used that as an excuse to examine Ellen  Oh  How old was little Ellen?  17  The sitcom and talk show star says her stepfather, whom she did not identify by name, told her he thought he'd felt a lump in her mother's other breast 
[01:13:30]  Uh-huh  But he didn't want to alarm the mom, Betty there, so he needed to feel mine to make sure  Ah, the little comparison  Alright  What, the guy's getting in trouble for just trying to help out?  So he's feeling up Ellen's mom there  Feels a lump  Doesn't want to alarm her, because she's been through hell and back already  So he decides to alarm Ellen  Let me see if there's a lump on you in the same spot  And, oh, okay 
[01:14:00]  Sounds logical, huh?  Sounds perfectly fine  He made me lie down because he said he felt hers while she was lying  Ah, and I had my penis in her at the time  That could have maybe caused a lump here, so I'm going to have to have sex with you  Look, I know it's wrong, but you've got to respect this guy  Alright, look, well, that was God  How old are you?  Almost 18  He really thought it out  That's called trading in the old model and picking up the new one  It escalated into other things 
[01:14:30]  He tried to break down the door to my bedroom  I had to kick a window out and escape and sleep in a hospital all night long  Do you think she was dancing when he knocked the, uh, when he kicked the door in?  Was she there just dancing?  Oh, look, and then she's just hoping that he'll start dancing and she could defuse the situation?  She's not, she's not, yeah, she's not dancing  She's not dancing every, uh, morning  I think she's trying to be, uh, a tough target  Don't touch my tent 
[01:15:00]  The clock came walking in with duct tape on its mouth and a heart on  See no evil  Hear no evil, speak no evil  Ding, ding, ding  And she also talks about Anne Heche, I guess  Oh, really?  Yeah  Well, Anne broke my heart into a million pieces, DeGeneres says  When Anne left, I'd wake up in the morning and my eyes would just immediately fill up with tears  And I would start convulsively crying  I'd watch the sun come up and then go down  And I'd literally be in the same place on the floor  I've never spoken to her since she left, she says 
[01:15:30]  Though recently, while driving, she thought she saw Anne Heche  Oh, try to run her over  There would have been a point where that would have made me so nervous  But I realized I felt nothing  And feeling nothing about her was great  Wow  Look at the hot one she's got now, though  Fifteen years, her junior, yes  Portia De Rossi  Yes  There you go  So, Ellen DeGeneres, coming out as an abuse survivor this morning  Celebrity stop  I like Ellen a lot, but it's like, come on, already  It's quick  We don't care 
[01:16:00]  Stop it  Stop whining  Fine, you're a winner, you beat us  Well, they're smart enough to know that these magazines want to do these interviews  And they've got to have a little tidbit  A little thing  And then that little thing is printed in all the newspapers  And then us, as the consumers, go out and buy the magazine to get the full interview  Stop whining  Stop whining  Stop it  Ellen DeGeneres, survivor  Are the phones working yet? 
[01:16:30]  No  Nothing  Oh, my God  What's the problem?  The phones don't look right  What is that?  I don't know  Breathe  I like that  It says, not connected to a server  You see what happens?  Yeah  When we don't have the equipment working?  We came out of the box swinging today  We did an hour straight of really, really good radio  And now we're sitting waiting for everyone else to catch up to us  That's what happens  Again  Technical difficulties 
[01:17:00]  Please stand by  Alright, we'll go to the Sue Johansson  Yeah  Sex stuff  I like her  We'll refocus here  She's the sexy old bag  The grandma  We've been having a lot of fun with her the last few days  Is that Portia de Rossi, Topless?  What was that from?  Where did that come from?  Thank you once again, Mr. Skin  What movie is that from, Eric?  That is from Women in Film  Women in Film  She's lovely  She certainly is  Lovely  She sure is a pretty gal 
[01:17:30]  I gotta take my car into the shop  Because I was backing up in my garage  The little Mexican man who works there  I'm like, I'll get it  And I feel like waiting for him  Because he was smoking with his awful mustache  And I'm backing it up  And I promptly ripped my goddamn mirror off  Oh no  When you're backing up  And you're looking behind you  There's no worse sound than plastic  When you, like, that  The final sound of a mirror being ripped off  Oh no  So I just  And then of course  He's so panicked about his own fucking job 
[01:18:00]  He's like  I tell you  Shut up, stupid  It's not your fault  It was my fault  Oh my goodness  Did you have to get out of your car  And pick your mirror up?  No, it was just dangling  Unfortunately  I didn't even have the dignity to hit the floor  It's just hanging there  Like it was punched off  While me and my fucking  Also non-fighting radio partner  Sat there like girls  So I got to drive it in today  The clunk on the side  Really was annoying  Is it making a little scratch now?  I know  I purposely  I thought it  I didn't drive it  I actually just took a cab downtown  And did my thing 
[01:18:30]  What's that going to run you?  I don't know  I got to get it tuned up anyway  Probably hundreds  Yeah, whatever  Probably hundreds  It's not an easy fix these days  No  Brand new mirror  Just get it  Put it on  These side mirrors now  You used to just go  They're complicated  Go down to the auto parts store  Buy another mirror  And zip screw it into your door  And that was pretty much it  Now, oh, this is a very intricate part  Actually, we're going to have to replace  Your entire right side of the vehicle  Which is attached to the engine  It's attached to  Yeah  The whole front quarter panel now  Has to be replaced  It's one piece 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, it's very irritating  And I already had the right side  Ripped off one time  While I was driving  I hit it to a parked truck  So that's nice to have  Two brand new ones  You have another mirror?  What's wrong with you?  I'm busy  I get scared sometimes  You don't know the parameters  Of your vehicle?  I do, but I just panic  And close my eyes  And hold the wheel  Just shake your eyes  I hope it's wide enough  For me to get through  Please let it be okay, God  I like my  I love my mirrors  Go in automatically  If it gets a little thin  There have been some roads  Where I'm like  Hmm 
[01:19:30]  This is a little thin  Like an oil truck  Is making a delivery  I could hit a button  And my mirrors go  And pull in  I don't got to lean over  And roll the window down  And pull it in  Well, fancy car  That would have  I'm sorry  I drive a Saturn  Which is nice  My mirrors adjust too  All you gotta do  Is get close enough  To the pole  And back up  Once you get close there  All of a sudden  It's not in your way anymore  There it is  Dangling by the side  Of your door  It's kind of like  The same thing  Fantastic  I gotta get this fixed 
[01:20:00]  I'm annoyed  Alright, why don't we  Go back to Sue Johansson  I think the phones  Are about to work again  For us, Anthony  I'm right with the  Starbucks lid  What's wrong?  It's the same thing  You complain about  These lids  That fucking drip  All over you  It's annoying  Liddy, what do you think  Is wrong with your cousin  The coffee lid?  I don't know  He's a real wet end  Easy, Liddy  Oh, Liddy  Carl from Jersey  Let's see if the phones  Are working  Carl?  Yes, sir  You hot, Carl? 
[01:20:30]  That mirror's gonna cost you  Two dates  Two dates  Yeah, put it in those terms  That's pretty good  Bye, Carl  Yeah, it's gonna be  A couple hundred bucks  Easily  I've been good  I have not done  Anything naughty  In a few days  I don't know if it's  The Starbucks lid  By the way  Or my lip  I think I drank coffee wrong  Well, maybe you  Sip mine before I got it  What?  You got the same thing?  It's not dripping  Out of my mouth, dude  It's like when you  Hold the cup  It comes out the side  That overlaps  All over your hand  Yeah  It's like how much of it 
[01:21:00]  Is stored up in that top  Between the brim and the lid  They fill it up to the tippy top  And then they put the lid on  And I don't think the lid  Is like a watertight gasket  Around the top of it  So it comes out  I don't know  It just hurts a little bit  When I'm drinking my coffee  It's dripping all over the place  It bugs me  I got coffee  Like stains on every shirt I own  Really?  Yeah, because it just drips  Every morning  Dribbles  Slowly drips down the front of me  Alright, so Sue Johansson  She does the sex talk  On the Oxygen channel  Her hook is that she's a grandma 
[01:21:30]  And she knows so much about sex  Because she's just banging  All the time, Anthony  Yeah, she knows nothing  She's just one of those  Hip grandmas  Enough with the hip grandmas  Yeah, exactly  Be what you are  Just diaper using  Inconsiderate  Why can't I think of the word  When I need it?  Incontinent?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  It was going to be something  About how they're in the way  Oh  I can't even think of the word  Now that I've paused  And completely spoiled everything  You really did  Diaper wearing 
[01:22:00]  Inconsiderate  Yeah, because grandmas  Are always so inconsiderate  I know  While they're kissing you  And giving you cookies  Dollars  I loved my nana  I'm going to ask all I am  My nana  Why is it one's got to be grandma  And one's got to be nana  This is my nana  This is my grandma  Like my mother's mother  Is grandma  And my father's mother  She was nana  Same thing  Yeah  Except nanny  Nanny  That's what I said too  Nanny  I think as a kid 
[01:22:30]  They wanted us to call her nana  But we would always say nanny  Because, I don't know  It's kind of more fun  To say nanny  Yeah, well they  I think it was like a rivalry  Almost between grandmothers  There's always that rivalry  Yeah  I remember my dad's mom  Once said  No, no, no  I'm nanny  And she's  Mother of the whore  That could show  Some type of rivalry  I know my father's family  Was a lot more fun  To be around  When I was a kid  We used to go over 
[01:23:00]  Their house  Out in Queens  We'd go over  One of their houses  For Christmas  So the only time  I really saw them  Was during Christmas  So they were just  Raging alcoholics  Drinking, having fun  Santa would come down  Into the basement  And give us kids  All presents  And everything like that  And I saw my mother's  Side of the family  A lot  Like every weekend  They lived in Huntington  So we would drive over there  And they were like  The boring family  Because you'd see them  So often  Nothing really was going on  And I realized  How much fun  My father's family was  Because they were all drinking  Yeah, yeah, yeah 
[01:23:30]  There was no rivalry  In my family  No, huh?  I had one awesome grandma  My dad's mother  Yeah  And then I had  My mom's thing  Who was a raving twat  Was that the  One that called you precious?  Yeah  On her deathbed  On her deathbed?  And I told my mom  I'd be in the car  Waiting for her  They'd bring the whole family  Oh my god  That's tragic  It's not tragic  That is tragic  She was a lunatic  She was a raving lunatic 
[01:24:00]  She was a twat  Yeah  A no good woman  She was never officially  My grandma in my eyes  Yeah  We had to call her  Aunt Bea  Whatever the hell  Really?  And that was before  I was nicknamed Opie  By the way  That's really bad  If there's two  Mayberry references  In your family  Absolutely  My mom blew off  Her own mom  For the sanity  Of us kids  Really?  Oh yeah  She was a douche  An absolute douche  But then when the end  Was near  The end was near  I went from  I couldn't even tell you  I don't even know 
[01:24:30]  I think I was like  Eight or ten years old  I don't even know  I really don't know  Around eight or ten  Was the last time  I saw my mom's mom  And then you fast forward  About ten, fifteen years  And I was about  Twenty-four, twenty-five  And she's in a nursing home  After having a stroke  And I'm seeing her  For the first time  In many, many, many years  And she's looking at me  Going oh precious  You've grown up  Precious  And I just went  Under my breath  Ugh  Mom I'll be in the car  Do what you have to do  Do what you have to do  Like she's going to smother her  With a pillow  That's funny  Do what you got to do  I'll leave the car running 
[01:25:00]  Chief, do whatever is necessary  I'll be outside  You take Mac with you  Throw this fountain  Through a window  But my dad's mom  You know  Picked up the slack  Yeah  Big time  So I never felt like  I didn't have  You know  That grandma  You know  Thing happening  Right  But my mom's mom  Pure evil  Wow  Pure fucking evil  Even while calling you precious  Ugh  Couldn't be bothered  Yeah  You just had to  I'll wait out in the car  At this point  You couldn't even walk anymore  I could 
[01:25:30]  Could be bothered  Wow  So  What it's not that big of a deal  It happens to everybody  Right  Everybody has the family relations  It's not the one you open mouth kissed  Right  Oh fuck no  Uh oh  She was the one with the old lady house  That just scared the shit out of us  Which is the one that you actually were kissing  And you grabbed by the back of the head  Pushed her head down  Yeah come here grandma  Pushed that head down  Just a deep open eyed kiss  Get a nice handful of that thin curly hair 
[01:26:00]  Pushed it down  Wait what did I used to do to my ex-girlfriend's grandmother  I used to tell her that I was going to dry humper  Or was that her mother  Her grandmother  I was going to grab  Push up against the kitchen counter  Yeah  And reach my hand around  And squeeze her ass  And dry humper in her house dress  Why is everyone saying inconvenient  What did we do wrong there  That was what Jimmy said  Oh inconvenient is probably the word I was looking for 
[01:26:30]  Or whatever  Yeah maybe that's it  I'm not sure  I just  I couldn't think of the word  I just drew a complete blank  Yeah  I'm cute  Okay  Nervous  Alright so why don't we move on  With Sue Johansson  The grandma talking about sex  Anthony on the Oxygen channel  This is a lot of fun  Here's good old Sue  Talking about prehistoric vibrators  And what they don't realize of course  Is that male and female  What the hell happened there  Hold on one sec  Wait did you have the wrong track queued up  I think it was my fault actually  Let's go to this 
[01:27:00]  So it's called the aqua erotic  And it looks like your average  Garden variety hard vibrator  But this one is different  You can fill this one with hot water  Not too hot folks  Be gentle now  Or cold water  To give different sensations  And it gives a whole new meaning  To priming the pump  What the hell is going on  I know that's definitely the track  But it's just listed wrong  Uh oh 
[01:27:30]  I want to hear about prehistoric vibrators  You can even add food coloring  Just for fun  We heard that  Now  A couple of  Oh that stinks  I want to hear about prehistoric vibrators  Maybe that's the one  Didn't she say  Maybe that's the one  Where she said something  No  No  Let's track through it  Huh  Eh track through it  Alright let's try this one  The male birth control pill  Get the 411 on the next frontier  And now we've got Tracy  Hi Tracy  Hi Sue how are you  I'm fine  Good  I'm calling concerning the male birth control  Got a question  Yeah  The male birth control pill 
[01:28:00]  Yes  Um I was wondering  Which one  I'm sorry  There isn't one  Oh there isn't one  No  Oh I've been misled  Uh oh  Who's telling you that there's a male birth control pill  Guy's popping pez going yeah I'm safe  Open up  I don't want to wear a bag  I ate this it's all good  This is great  I keep him in a St. Joseph's baby aspirin bottle  There is something called a male birth control pill  It's on the end of an arm  And it curls up into a fist 
[01:28:30]  My boyfriend  Okay  No he was watching a program on television tonight  And he said that there was something about it  Oh they're doing research on them  Okay  But they haven't  I got some of the research they're doing on the male birth control pill right here  As a matter of fact 
[01:29:00]  That's it  No baby  Something about it  Oh they're doing research on them  Okay  But they haven't got it yet  Okay I see  They have  They know  They can use an androgen progesterone combination  Okay  But what happens is  Androgen is testosterone  And that affects him in other ways 
[01:29:30]  Okay  And what it does is it eliminates sperm  But it also reduces his sex drive to diddly squat  Well we won't have that then  No we don't want that one  There's another one they're working on which changes the coating on the sperm  Okay  So that they don't glom onto an egg  And there's another one they're working on which causes sperm to clump and immobilize  Okay  But they're nowhere near 
[01:30:00]  We're looking at at least another five years  There's not much enthusiasm for research into a male birth control pill  That's great  Okay  Females are much more pliable  And much more amenable to using birth control  Because we've got more at stake than guys do  Fair enough  Fair enough  Thank you very much  So don't  You just don't  Uh uh  Not buying that one dear  Thank you very much  Okay  Bye bye  Bye Tracy  Cottage cheese load  You jam a tomato in your mouth before you blow your load 
[01:30:30]  Here you go fatso  There you go  Take this face full of rice pudding  That causes it to clump  Wonderful  Do it in a bucket  Let her fix her tub tiles  I don't think we would be good at taking birth control pills  No  Oh look at Al Roker's talking to a little down syndrome gentleman on today's show  Oh Al's number one fan  We just missed it unfortunately  We just missed it 
[01:31:00]  Oh are we recording that in the office  Well you know you gotta be politically correct you know  Make sure you talk to everybody  A little handicapped gentleman  It's online outside the today show  Oh please tell me that we have that from the office  Do we have Al talking to his retarded fans  I hope so  How does that feel when you're in show business all these years  And your number one fan is three foot eight  And three foot of that is head  Number one fan are you really thanks  44 inch waist  Beat it 
[01:31:30]  A wading pool is not a hat  Hands are fast  Anyway  Male birth control pills  Yeah  Speaking of when it's needed  Stop  That tied in  Yeah really  Someone that should have taken it  I can't remember to take my vitamins every morning  Yeah  We're gonna start taking male birth control pills  Well they're working on it  Toilet terror 
[01:32:00]  This is the one  Can you catch an STD from a toilet seat  No there's nothing you can get from a toilet seat  Honestly honey  Now think of the construction of a toilet seat  Okay  Yeah  Now the bacteria or the virus  If we're talking about gonorrhea  If we're talking about herpes  Which is a virus  If we're talking about chlamydia  If we're talking about venereal warts  Which is a virus  Has to gain access to your body  Can't do it through intact skin  And particularly intact skin on your tush 
[01:32:30]  Which is pretty tough stuff  So it has to have a break or a sore  Or a pimple or something like that  On your tush  So  Possible  Your roommate  Who may have something  Has to have that herpes blister  Let's say  On her tush  Well that's very unusual  Most times it's on your genitals  Not on your tush  So it doesn't get on the seat  Even if it did get on the seat  When was the last time  Your genitals  Touched the seat of a toilet  Like you'd have to put one foot in the bowl 
[01:33:00]  And one foot on the floor  I don't think you're going to do that  So no you don't get stuff from toilets  It's what you do in a toilet  That can get you into trouble  Like who you take into the washroom with you  That'll get you into trouble  What an idiot  Washroom  You move sideways to get toilet paper or something  Your genitals  Of course  Bouncing all over the place  Just scraping on that seat  Scraping on the seat  Dipping in the water  Oh  Just ask Ben  He's got to be careful what's on the floor 
[01:33:30]  You ever lean forward and get a nice cold treat  Oh  Nice  A little geyser  Oh god  A splashback  Let's go to George in Colorado  George  Hey guys  What's up George  Hey  Last week when  Al Roker  Went on that hot air balloon  Yeah  He was out here in Colorado  And on the news  Here in Colorado  He was on with the weather guy beforehand  And as the guy is giving the weather forecast 
[01:34:00]  Al Roker is in the background  Singing John Denver songs  Great  Too bad that  The whole thing didn't end like John Denver did  Plummeting to earth  It would have been nice if it would have  Because he can't carry a tune  It was disgusting  Alright  Yeah but what was the other guy doing?  Shut up  Laughing  Was he  Jimmy  No  Thank you George  Was Al giving the weather George?  Goodbye Jimmy  George  Just wanted to tend to live off the fatter land George 
[01:34:30]  What is this  Eric handed me a note  Al Roker bit  She just looked retarded  She isn't though  Okay  Yeah she wasn't retarded  That's no fun  What?  The lady just looked it  But she wasn't retarded  She spoke normally  What fun is that?  Totally impossible  Really?  That's what they just said  That was one of the most retarded people  I've ever gazed upon  I know  Let's get Danny in here  You know how you know?  Because when you see someone  All of a sudden you realize  That your hand is balled into a fist  And you're like  Wow  It just  You want to drive it into their head 
[01:35:00]  You just took a look at the tape  Yeah with Steve  It was when he was  Looking at people in the crowd right?  Yeah  Just now  And then there was a sign  Number one  Looked absolutely retarded  It was a girl?  A girl right?  We don't know  Long hair?  I couldn't tell  No short hair  No dude dude  She was  Did you ever see  Someone with down syndrome?  Absolutely  It was someone with down syndrome  There was a girl that looked a little retarded  But  No no  I'm talking  Take me back  And show me what you need  Take me back  And show me what you need  I'll be right back  You didn't mistake it for somebody  That came running up behind a live news shot 
[01:35:30]  This morning did you?  They looked a little off  How do you not know?  Yeah get him on the phone  Jimmy's gotta go back there and look now  How do you not know?  No it wasn't retarded  No that  Alright we got Eric going back to the back office  Yeah  Eric  Rewinding the tape  Taking a look  Yeah  What?  Oh wait 
[01:36:00]  Jim's back already  What?  No wonder Danny doesn't recognize retarded people  He sits in that booth all the time  They're used to each other  Yeah she's a retard  It was the same person?  Yeah  Steven's perfect diction confirmed it  She's retarded  I'm getting the audio  Is that it?  Steve just puts his head  He just looks at me  He goes  Uh oh  Don't blame Steve  Because now here he comes  Uh oh  He was totally blaming you  Yeah he was  Saying that he said  Is she retarded?  And he goes  Steve just threw his arms up  And went  No no no 
[01:36:30]  You went  And he went  So apparently  You walk around here going  That's exactly how I act  No  He showed me video of a non-racial  Sorry  It's been so long since you've done that  I walked right through it  Uh yeah he showed me a video of a non-retarded woman  Speaking to Al Roker  Oh my god Danny  And he said oh look at that retard  I mean that's not a retard  Yeah but  It had just happened  So I said  Apparently Al Roker is talking to some retarded girl  So we backed up to the very last point of Al Roker interviewing people 
[01:37:00]  And we watched that segment  Didn't look like there was any retarded people there  Had a brief exchange with a retarded man named Herb  And  Herb  Here's the audio  I saw a woman that looked a little retarded  Hold on  Just because Green Goblin face couldn't find it  Jesus  Alright let's listen in here  My name's Herb  Hi Herb how you doing where you guys from 
[01:37:30]  Washington State  Washington State  Alright Herb thanks for coming down  Good to see you  That's it huh  Understandable how you can mistake that for a perfectly normal banker or insurance salesman  Who's a quite quite retarded looking person  Herb  Herb  My name is Herb  Herb  Let me hear Herb again  My name's Herb  Hi Herb how you doing where you guys from  Washington State  Washington State  Alright Herb thanks for coming down  Good to see you  Oh Al didn't you want to stay there for any length of time 
[01:38:00]  Herb  Al panicked  He thought he could handle it and then realized  Oh fuck  That's the first time I've ever seen being nervous combined with down syndrome  Herb  Herb  Herb  Chef in the future  Chef in the future  That's great  Oh he came right on the thing  Not retarded  Yeah  Obviously it was the wrong  Well retarded  Sounded totally normal  Yeah  Herb  Very retarded  Herb  Have we played Time of My Life in a while? 
[01:38:30]  Oh I love that one  A lot of new listeners  One of my favorites  You can go to break with it  Yeah  This is  This happens a lot  They take these mentally challenged groups to amusement parks  And I believe this one was Great Adventure  Six Flags down there in New Jersey  And they have these places you can go into to be  To make a music video  Or a recording  And you go into a booth  And it's like karaoke  And they record it  And when you're done  You get a  I guess a record  Or now they probably give you a CD 
[01:39:00]  But they sent two of these handicapped people  A guy and a girl in there  To sing the song made famous from the movie Dirty Dancing  That's wonderful  Haunting  But I've had the time of my life  Herb  Now I've never felt this way before  Yes I swear  It's the truth  And I owe it all to you 
[01:39:30]  Cause I've had the time of my life  Yeah  Yeah  I've always thought of you  Okay  Terrific  I've been waiting for so long  Now I finally found this one to stay by me  Yeah  While we're riding on the wall 
[01:40:00]  And you felt a magic called fantasy  No one put baby in a padded corner  No one put baby in a padded corner  Can we imagine it in our lives  In the way we can decide secretly  I'm scared of you  Don't be naked  Shut the pants  Don't be naked  You understand  That's our team  I'm scared  But just remember  Let's remember  Yeah  Let's go  Shut up 
[01:40:30]  Shut up  So I tell you something  Arrgh  There's gonna be lots of things  I've had the time of my life  But I've never felt this way before  Can your parents have any children that live?  Sir, yes sir  How about they were gripped now?

[01:44:00]  Bye!  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM. 
[01:44:30]  Poop goes the weasel.  Ramone, give me your sleeve.  Give me fuel, give me fire.  Give it up.  What are we watching? 
[01:45:00]  It's a video clip of Colin Quinn on some news show.  He's doing an interview.  And then toward the end, because he's bombing, he kind of grabs this chick and starts kissing her.  And I think she's probably none too happy about it.  And this is up on waxbag.com? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Kind of watching the interview.  Don't click the first link, because apparently that doesn't get to the meat and potatoes of it.  But now they have a link about three or four posts down.  That's the one where he kisses her.  Is this from some local TV show, obviously?  I guess so.  You know what city?  No.  Does it say it in the corner?  No.  No.  No.  And then he, yeah, because he's bombing. 
[01:46:00]  He's totally bombing.  And then he grabs her.  This is recent, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, because it says Friday, May 14th.  Saturday, May 15th.  All right, here he goes.  Oh, there he goes.  Kind of grabs this, starts kissing her.  He won't let go.  He's raping her.  Jesus Christ, Colin.  He's got her on the floor.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Do you know anything about that?  I had lunch with Colin yesterday. 
[01:46:30]  What the hell's wrong with him?  Well, this video's making the rounds, and, you know, she's supposed to be this, like, serious newswoman,  and next thing you know, at the end of the interview, he pretty much jumps out of his seat and starts kissing her  and knocks her down to the floor.  Yeah.  That's lost his mind.  That clip's going to have some play in the coming days.  You watch.  I just saw Colin yesterday.  No, he was in Cleveland, I think it was last week.  All right.  I guess that's Cleveland TV, then.  It might have been last week just a couple days ago.  Well, there you have it.  All right.  We're going back to the Sue Johansson stuff. 
[01:47:00]  Let's not poke fun, though.  Let's actually try to learn something.  All right.  Well, we got a couple of really interesting clips coming up here.  We'll start with the vibrators 101 for couples.  Ah, bringing a vibrator with you into the bedroom.  Take the vibrator.  Turn it on.  This one's just a rockin'.  Good advice.  My little whirling dervish.  It's okay.  This is why we have so much fun on this show. 
[01:47:30]  I'll turn it off now.  And when it's turned on, you just run.  What kind of 1800s lingo is she slinging?  It's probably got a head that rotates or something awful.  Yeah, something horrible.  Wraps the skin around it.  Do people still use the word whirling?  Whirling dervish.  It's some type of an infernal machine.  This wacky contraption.  We'll turn it off now.  And when it's turned on, you just rub that up the shaft of his penis, 
[01:48:00]  around the top of his penis, down the other side,  around each testicle, around his perineum.  No.  No.  Perineum.  Keep the vibrator away from the testicles.  Keep your whirling dervish away from me, you irrelevant old bag.  And away from my peridium.  What is that?  I think it's the taint.  That must be the taint, yeah.  Oh, I think that's what happened when you had two diem. 
[01:48:30]  Whirling dervish.  Do I sense a wackbag name?  Whoa, whirling dervish.  Chicken in.  Around each testicle, around his perineum, and around up to his rectum.  And you just kind of tease your way around there.  He is going to think he has died.  Was that the husband in the background going, no!  I got to back up.  Somebody said something.  Yeah, because it's a phone call she takes on the show, obviously.  And when she starts talking about the anus, you hear someone in the background going, 
[01:49:00]  oh!  Perineum, and around up to his rectum.  And you just kind of tease your way around there.  He is going to think he has died and gone to heaven.  Honestly, guys, once they get used to them, they really love vibrators.  Now, this is...  That's, to me, what you need to do.  What she said was great advice.  Lick the side, the head, the other side, down past the perineum.  I guess that's taint.  Yeah.  You know, you hold your nose past the oniony part and get right back to the anus. 
[01:49:30]  Do that with your tongue.  Not with your whirling dervish, you skeevish whores.  Vibrators.  Now, this is an ugly one.  It's what you call a big mother.  It can do major damage with, I think, like a baseball bat, but never mind.  It works, and it's a great demonstrator.  But, yeah, you can stimulate a man very, very easily.  Now, then, you can also show him how to stimulate you.  So you show him what is pleasurable for you, what's enjoyable for you, 
[01:50:00]  and then give him the vibrator and say,  Hi, big guy, how would you like to do it?  Okay?  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  Big guy.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Sexy talk.  Hi, big guy.  Hey, big guy.  Hey there, big fella.  Hey, Ace.  Let's go to Eddie in Kansas.  Eddie?  Yeah, what's happening?  What do you got for the program?  Hey, I was just going to let Jimmy know.  Paira deums?  Yes.  It's an Indian chick with large tits.  Huh? 
[01:50:30]  Get it, Paira deums?  Oh, my God.  Never.  Oh, wow.  I never, never explained your joke.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Pump it out, fellas.  Let me out here.  Punching out?  How about moseying on away?  You're done.  A whole retaining wall fell with that one.  Oh, my God.  Limping off.  It's horrid.  I think he's all heated right now.  Yeah.  It's all uncomfortable.  He's trying to listen to it.  That wasn't that bad.  Sitting there, staring at the phone, not believing he just did that. 
[01:51:00]  Paira deum.  Paira deum.  I'm trying to get it.  I got it.  Because every joke you get, it doesn't mean it's funny.  D's would be big.  Paira dees.  Right, sure.  Paira dees.  And if you're an Indian, you go, para deum.  Adding the um at the end.  Oh, all right.  You know.  Okay.  Like, ugh.  That's not a stretch.  These here are good-um.  Paira deums.  Paira deum.  Brother Joe.  Joker bomb-um.  We're on our way in this morning, but I just had an interesting observation. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Tag.  Wouldn't you think that, I mean, having probably a good 60 years of cock sucking under her  belt, she's going to be really fucking good?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just thought there was a different, there was a, you know, a different way of thinking  of it.  Like, we didn't hit on that 80 times.  That she stinks.  I don't know.  She's awful.  She's got to be, she's got to be really fucking good.  I mean, she's got to, you know.  No, they don't, none of these ones, even Dr. Ruth, any of these old bags that try to 
[01:52:00]  preach the sex, it's a gimmick.  They, they have no real sexual experience.  They probably were banged.  They stopped having sex years ago, and they think they could give advice, but they're  just popular because they're old and it's a novelty.  Their idea of being saucy is stuff that would have been considered, like, really saucy back  in 1965 or 67.  It's not saucy anymore.  Wearing stuff out of those black and white catalogs, the, like, torpedo tit bras, and  the big, ugly, crotchless panties. 
[01:52:30]  You want to be sexy.  If she's open enough to talk about stuff like that, I bet she, Joe, I bet she sucks a mean  cock.  If you want to be sexy, put on your one-piece and bathing cap.  Bring your parasol.  I'll shove it up your ass.  You guys make fun of her, but I don't know, man.  I bet she's probably pretty fucking good.  Well, you fuck her, then.  Exactly.  Tell us how it is.  Yeah, you grab her Einstein hair and force her head down.  Awful dude she has.  Let us know.  All right.  We're on our way, and we'll see you in a little while. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Hi, Joe.  We got the audio of Colin Quinn bombing on this local TV show.  It looks like Cleveland.  The video's up on whackbag.com.  It's getting a little play today, and we got the audio of this.  Those are the worst, by the way.  You go on the road, and they just put you on these local news shows.  Turn around for Jimmy.  Really fast.  He's about to attack the reporter.  They got a graphic up.  It's Colin Quinn's plug for him being at the improv.  Look what he does.  He reaches over, grabs her on the neck, starts kissing her on the side.  He knocks her out of the chair, and puts her on the floor. 
[01:53:30]  She's completely on the floor.  The chair falls backwards.  Now she's popping her head up, saying we'll be back or something.  I don't think any news reporter would be happy that that happened.  No, not at all.  Unless it was Al Roker, and it was a retard named Herb.  Herb.  I have a name, Herb.  All right, we're moving on.  Away from this.  Yeah.  Thanks for coming.  Al really did kind of dismiss him.  I certainly did.  I'm from Washington.  Are you really stupid?  It's raining there.  Don't kill yourself in Seattle. 
[01:54:00]  All right, who are you with the big tits?  All right.  Poor Liam.  My name's Herb.  Hi, Herb.  How you doing?  Where are you guys from?  Washington State.  Washington State.  All right, Herb.  Thanks for coming down.  Good to see you.  All right, Herb.  I think Herb just repeated what he heard.  All right, here we go.  Here's Colin Quinn.  Chance of showers out of Herb's mouth.  Wow.  How long are you going to be doing this stand-up thing for?  You plan to do it for a long time, hitting a lot of cities?  Yeah, I know I always do it in between whatever I'm doing. 
[01:54:30]  It's my favorite thing to do.  It shows that it's not a healthy thing, but it's the truth.  It's a lot of work, though.  Yeah, but it's fun.  You know, you're going to clubs, everyone's live.  It's just fun, you know?  And everybody loves you.  Everybody loves you, except a few drunk-headed idiots.  Sometimes you'll be on stage and some idiots will be like singing happy birthday to somebody.  In the middle of the show, you're like, are you stupid?  You don't sing like they think they're watching TV.  They're singing happy birthday in the middle of the show.  I bet you do well with the heck of the show.  We've got a graphic that says when you're going to be on.  Oh. 
[01:55:00]  Friday and Saturday, 8 o'clock and 10-15.  Yes.  All right.  And there's the number for tickets, 696-46-77.  And we'd like to...  Alicia, I'd like to...  I forgot to tell you.  Oh, we're not on camera anymore, huh?  Oh, Alicia.  Oh!  Ah!  Danita!  I mean...  Oh!  Mike!  Wow.  That clip's going to get some play today.  What the hell is wrong with Colin? 
[01:55:30]  That clip's going to get some play.  You can't just do that to women?  You certainly can.  Good boy, Carl.  And he wasn't bombing.  He was only one person.  It was just him and her talking.  I know.  That's what sucks.  People said he was bombing.  He wasn't bombing.  It's one person.  You're not getting...  Although, usually, if you're doing very well, you could hear the crew laughing.  You know?  Yes.  The crew was screaming at...  Watching their girl get assaulted here.  They were laughing?  Yeah.  You kind of heard the crew in the background kind of like...  Oh.  Chair goes flying.  She's on the floor.  Completely on the floor.  She starts asking for help. 
[01:56:00]  She's like, Mike?  Who's Mike?  Yeah.  Mike.  Help.  Probably the camera guy.  Oh.  All right.  Used by a pasty Irishman.  Good for Carl.  That's what you do, Carl.  Take what's yours, my friend.  Take what's yours.  The madman.  All right.  I just want to do two more with this Sue Johansson.  We've got to mention, by the way, in some conservative book, someone sent me a link or something  last night.  They mentioned Tough Crowd and Colin and myself and DePaulo, but I heard they just called 
[01:56:30]  me an anti-liberal shock comic.  Why?  Accurate?  I guess.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm just trashing.  I'm AIDS.  Bush is good.  No substance.  Stink.  All right.  Here's Sue, the grandma, talking about, does size matter?  And the other thing that's important for you to know is that the top two-thirds of the vagina  really has no nerve endings.  Right.  You know, when you're wearing a tampon, can you feel it? 
[01:57:00]  No.  No.  Because there's nobody home up there.  So, you know, having a big penis banging around in there really isn't much benefit.  The only thing is that there's that feeling of fullness, of containment.  Right.  You're aware that something is there, but it's not that it's highly exciting.  That's nice.  Your box feels like a loaded oil drum.  There's no feeling in the top two-thirds, which is why women make good heroin mules. 
[01:57:30]  That's wonderful.  So you don't need the big schlong.  Oh, God, no.  What?  A hundred years ago, back in Steamboat Springs Ranch in Western Clothing, we saluted them.  They got there in a covered wagon, I believe, didn't they?  Or a stagecoach.  They took a stagecoach in Boulder, and here they are in business.  God bless them.  Happy birthday from Smucker.  Uh-oh.  I think the FM light was from Ohio originally, too.  Somewhere in Ohio.  Smucker's, uh, happy birthday. 
[01:58:00]  Behind the jam jar, Dorothy Myers, Santa Barbara, California.  Came to the U.S. from Poland in 1913.  Has played poker in Las Vegas since 1948.  And if she's getting tired, a positive attitude and a sincere attitude, that's her secret.  What's inside her big uterus looks like within this jelly jar.  I owe a previous longevity to being a vegetarian for the first 18 years.  Hallelujah.  And then she saw a hamburger and said, I think I'm in love.  A positive attitude, loving people. 
[01:58:30]  She is one.  Big white bush.  There you go.  Save the bones for Henry.  Oh, look at this guy.  Oh, in Palm Harbor, Florida, plays pool four times a week.  And is known as a pool shark in his retirement community.  Makes the best chicken soup in the business.  That's right.  100 years old.  A pool shark.  Handsome man with a hat.  Ethel Gibbs of Virginia Beach.  Virginia.  Still takes care of her home and garden and enjoys entertaining friends with Bridge and Marjohn.  Great back of the 20s, Marjohn.  Edna Schaumeier of Mertstown, Pennsylvania. 
[01:59:00]  And she's 100.  Hobbies are baking, sewing, and terrific for longevity.  Get this tattoo off her arm.  A teaspoon of vinegar and a teaspoon of honey and a glass of water every day.  That's your secret, isn't it?  You're beautiful, girl.  Gorgeous girl.  Dorothy Fitch, Elmhurst, Illinois, is 102.  Wow.  And swam daily until a few years ago.  Uh-oh.  What happened a few years ago?  She got out of the tub in the Overlook Hotel.  Now back to Big Al.  With Willard Scott doing his happy birthday. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, Willard is, uh, smucker, jelly, happy birthday.  He's starting to sound like everything's loosening up in his mouth, too.  Hey.  We were just talking about that the other day.  She swam her up until a couple of years ago.  Oh.  Oh, what happened?  You're 102 years old.  You know there was something happened there.  You know some of those people were, like, just CEOs of their company.  Oh.  Companies, and now they're the pole shark at the retirement home.  The old guy was probably a P-51 pilot, and the big one dropping Nazis out of the sky. 
[02:00:00]  The only reason you're a shark now is because everyone else is trying to sink the eight ball  in the colostomy bags thing.  Whatever that was called.  The little tube.  I'm with you, though, bro.  That was good.  They don't have to powder their stick.  Their dry skin just flakes off on it.  My prostate in the corner pocket.  Face first in the velvet.  Horrible.  Horrible. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, boy.  Time is a bitch.  But there's a lot of people living to be 100.  It's amazing how many people.  It's like the life expectancy is.  It's kind of encouraging to see that.  That actually, that group that they showed, obviously it's radio.  You didn't see it, but we were here watching.  They put their little pictures up on the jelly jars.  That group wasn't that bad.  Because some of them they show, and it's like, ooh, what is this?  Post-mortem?  What picture is that?  They're just really old and haggard.  They're being introduced by Dr. Michael Bodden.  That creep. 
[02:01:00]  I love him.  And the maggots kind of really like.  We pulled the french fry out of our stomach, and we saw sturation marks.  Yeah, creep.  I love that guy.  Ghoul.  The fucking ghoul.  If it's in a log, he knows where you got it.  He matches up, like, log samples with receipts from the perks.  That guy's a classic.  What a private detective he'd make.  Log samples.  Has your shit into a sieve.  Carrots.  You trace down to the produce department of wall bombs. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, what a ghoul, though.  Just talks about dead people and hacking them up like it's nothing.  And that woman who narrated that HBO series about the bodies, whatever, America Undercover,  whatever it was, she does a lot of narration.  She's phenomenal, man.  What a morbid, awful voice.  You see that body farm that they have?  They take dead people and kind of give their bodies away, and they lay them out in fields.  They put them in trunks of cars.  They keep them in the weather. 
[02:02:00]  Sometimes they bury them a little bit.  And this is also, they can see how the body, the dead body, reacts to certain conditions  that it's left in, and that way they can help solve crimes and know how long a body's been  in one place, depending on how many bugs are on it.  There's a great description of that in the book Stiff.  Really?  There's a book out there called Stiff.  It's all about what happens to your body when you die.  And how, like, when you dedicate your body to, or give your body to science, some of the  things they use it for.  Yeah.  That's one of them.  We're going to pop you in a trunk. 
[02:02:30]  Human, the human test dummies.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  All sorts of stuff that you had no idea what was going on after you died.  Really?  They strapped into cars and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  And crashing?  They practice, uh, they practice, uh, facelifts on, uh, on, uh, on, uh, on old, uh,  That's gotta be creepy.  Old heads.  Some of them, they even prop up in a studio on 46th Street and give them their own radio  show.  Fucking dumb dog company.  Why is stock plummeting?  I don't know.  Martha Stewart, seven million a year?  Shitheads?  John from Arizona. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, yeah, yeah, I have something for the show.  All right.  Hey, you guys are knocking the old women?  Hey, I tell you, that's pretty much all I sleep with is old bags.  Well, how old are you?  Uh, 33.  And how old are they?  Uh, the last one I banged last week was, uh, 62.  You should be executed.  Why?  Because it's gross.  I'm telling you, just, it's not bad.  It's not like you think.  I, I, how could it not be like I think?  She's 62.  Experience?  I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's awesome. 
[02:03:30]  I mean, they're, they're good.  The pussies are still, they still have a lot of time.  Hey, you gotta think the old broad, uh, tries a little harder for you because she's not  getting it a lot.  Where are you picking up these ladies?  You ever push her legs back and, like, have her spine pop out of her neck?  What's that?  Nothing.  Where are you picking up these broads?  Uh, there's a couple of old clubs in town here and I've, and to be honest, I've, I've  picked them up at the bingo hall once or twice too.  He's kidding.  Are you kidding, bro?  I'm not kidding.  I'm dead serious.  Stop it.  I'm serious.  What's, uh, what's the oldest? 
[02:04:00]  Uh, I would say, well, probably this one this last week here was 62.  I'd say that'd be it.  Is it a turn on for you?  Uh, yeah, in a way, yeah.  I mean, like I said, you ain't got, you can bust all up in them, skeet up in there.  You ain't got to worry about nothing happening.  I mean, God.  You can skeet up in there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, in Arizona, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it must just be like tooled leather, the skin.  They're extra dry.  In Arizona.  Speaking of dry.  Hey, hi, guys.  Later.  Bye. 
[02:04:30]  Oh.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry, dry vagina.  So, before my penis starts to get sore, come pick up some dazzy lube at your local drugstore. 
[02:05:00]  Said, go get some dazzy lube at your local drugstore.  Oh, you stink, baby.  Ah, brother Joe.  Dry vagina.  A classic.  That's what that guy's dealing with.  That's disgusting.  Bill Burr in studio today as well.  Hey, Angel.  How you been?  What's going on?  Well, we're, uh...  Headphones are flying all over.  It's tangled in his chair.  We're playing clips from this, uh, Sue Johansson, Bill. 
[02:05:30]  You ever hear of her?  Some Canuck old woman, grandma.  No.  She does a sex advice show.  Pretty graphic.  On the Oxygen Network.  You watch much Oxygen?  No.  If Lifetime isn't gay enough for you, then you go to, uh, Oxygen.  The Oxygen Network.  I don't even think I've, I've passed it by on my cable.  Have you ever stopped on the Oxygen Network?  I just don't.  Look at that.  Wow.  Imagine it's a commercial.  What a clink eating.  Is it one of those, uh, channels that it's like half the time it's on and then the other 
[02:06:00]  half it's like ESPN3 or something?  Wow.  I get really confused sometimes with my, my cable system.  I don't know.  I really don't know where the Oxygen Network is.  I don't even know where it is.  Yeah.  What it is.  She's like, what, some Canadian, uh, Dr. Ruth kind of thing?  Yeah, but she's like, she realized she had to take it to the extreme.  So where Dr. Ruth would normally go, I don't talk about things like that.  You know, like, like really doesn't, uh, get that, that graphic.  This granny just doesn't care.  She picks up.  Stick it up the ass.  She's like really graphic. 
[02:06:30]  Nice.  Picks up the slack.  Yeah, we're in the middle.  We should start from the beginning.  So Bill is, uh, with us here.  She's talking about if, uh, size matters, Bill.  Yeah.  Oh.  A question, uh, a lot of ladies want to know.  And the other thing that's important for you to know is that the top two-thirds of the  vagina really has no nerve endings.  Right.  You know, when you're wearing a tampon, can you feel it?  No.  No.  Because there's nobody home up there.  So, you know, having a big penis banging around in there really isn't much benefit.  The only thing is that there's that feeling of fullness. 
[02:07:00]  Of containment.  Right.  You're aware that something is there.  But fullness.  Containment.  You're aware that something's there.  Yeah.  I sense that there's a, uh, large member.  There's a disturbance in the vagina.  I sense a disturbance.  I sense a fullness.  Uh, is she, uh...  But isn't that part of what's good about having size? 
[02:07:30]  I'm thinking, you know, I'm thinking for the lady it's a huge turn-on knowing you're  getting railed by a huge one, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, and when you, uh, you know, you pull out that huge hog and she sees it, that's part  of it.  You don't want this little stub.  Yeah.  I think it definitely matters to them because anytime anybody of any sort of size, they  see it, they lose their minds.  Yeah.  There you go.  What are those, uh, what are those, those Chippendale clubs that I've heard about?  Uh, right.  See?  The girls go there.  They don't want to see little things. 
[02:08:00]  Exactly.  There's no average guy coming out there.  Yeah, no, everybody comes out there, is packing.  That's it.  They want to see a guy dressed as a cowboy come out and rip his pants off and go, hello,  I'm Ben Sparks, shake their hand with his cock.  Ben's cock probably only gets half hard all the time.  He just reminds me of one of those guys, his cock will probably be like, he'll just hold  it like to keep it from dangling, but it's just so big you don't even notice.  His body has decided any more blood and he'd pass out.  Yeah, he's, Ben Sparks is packing.  Oh, it's awful. 
[02:08:30]  What a fucking dilemma for a woman, huh?  It's been an ongoing thing.  Jimmy and I think he's packing.  We don't know what's going on.  It's just a massive lump down between his legs.  I'm not sure if he just has one of those big balls or something.  Or if he's got a huge mule.  Had a hernia?  Maybe he had a hernia.  But you have to look at it.  It makes him so uncomfortable, he just covers it with his little hands.  Oh, he's all ashamed.  When he comes in here, we all stare at it and he gets all ashamed and puts his bottle  or whatever he's drinking in front of it or newspaper. 
[02:09:00]  Very shamed by his huge hog.  Yeah, see right there, I would think that maybe that's a big ball.  Yeah, you think it's nuts?  Yeah, no, because I would think that there's a confidence, a swagger that comes with packing.  That he doesn't have?  Yeah.  Not if it causes you trouble, though.  Not if a gym teacher would poke it and go, did you steal something?  And kind of feel it and touch it.  My friend Marvin had a security guard because Marvin had a big cock.  We were still in Star Wars figures and the guy searched us.  But Marvin, I guess, had a huge bulge and the guy asked me to leave the room.  I remember he asked Marvin. 
[02:09:30]  Uh-oh.  He goes, pull your thing aside.  Like your shorts aside.  We were really young.  We wanted to make sure that he didn't have any Star Wars figures in there.  Yeah.  Nice.  It's kind of an odd-shaped cock.  And then he had me leave the room.  The security guard had me leave the room.  Yeah.  So there was something creepy going on there.  Did you peek in?  No, I didn't.  I didn't think twice until many years later.  I'm like, well, that was kind of...  I didn't, you know, at the time...  Security guards sucking on Jabba the Hutt's head. 
[02:10:00]  A little carbon freeze all over his face.  Let's go back to the clip here, boys.  Okay.  Is there.  But it's not that it's highly exciting.  Now, there are penis augmentation toys, and I don't have any of them here.  But they're like a sleeve that slides over the penis.  Oh, I see.  And that makes the penis feel bigger in your vagina. 
[02:10:30]  The problem is, for him, it covers his penis completely, so he doesn't get any sensations of thrusting.  How awful is your life when you have to put what is like a toilet paper roll over your cock to make your woman feel good?  That's got to be really awful.  I know it's small, but I can augment it.  I'll get it for you.  I'll augment this one, baby.  You're going to love my augmentation.  You've got to break that out out of the drawer and put it on in front of her. 
[02:11:00]  There was one that I saw once in, I think it was a swank, the back of swank magazine.  And it's like a piece of a dildo.  Looks like about three or four inches of dick.  And then the rest of it is like a thick-skinned condom that rolls down over your dick.  So you put this tip on your tip and then roll the rest down over your dick.  And now you have this, what amounts to a dildo, that's filled with half of your dick.  Wow, how small are you where you have a dick and you still need a strap-on? 
[02:11:30]  You still need a strap-on.  That's pretty much it.  It's a strap-on that goes over your dick.  Wouldn't she just be laughing at you?  Oh, of course.  You look just silly.  Silly, that thing.  That's got to be a mood kill.  You're like fucking really well.  It's like, oh, quick, augment it.  Augmented.  Yeah, why wouldn't you just get a dildo and just use it with your hand?  You still maintain some of your manhood, you know what I mean?  Rub it out with your two little fingers.  Give yourself a little one.  She's laying back with pleasure finally and you're just staring at her wondering her throat 
[02:12:00]  would look like open as you shove it in and out of her.  In and out, in and out, in and out.  Hit her for needing that.  So he'd use that after he's ejaculated or something like that.  Oh, all right.  What about using a vibrator?  Never tried it.  Well, now, think about this.  Is your partner fairly open-minded and fairly liberated?  Somewhat.  Okay.  What if he, if you had intercourse, okay, he ejaculated and then you got out your handy 
[02:12:30]  dandy little vibrator and he would use the vibrator on you for vaginal stimulation.  Yeah, that just says, you can't satisfy me.  Yeah.  You know, you finish up and then that's going to happen.  Finish up with the disgusting thing you do and then make sure you take care of me.  At that point, we're reaching for the remote and then turning on ESPN.  Yeah, no, really.  We're going to help you out now.  That's what I do now.  How would your woman feel after you had sex? 
[02:13:00]  If she had an orgasm, if you're, just sit back and then you like hollowed something out  and fucked it right in front of her.  That would bother a woman.  I'm going to bring in a blow-up style now and just start humping it on the bed here next  to you.  Put this cheese in the microwave for 40 seconds and then hump it while looking at a picture  of anyone.  Try that.  You could try that.  How about there's a new toy out.  It's not exactly new.  It's called a strap-on.  And it, the one that.  What the hell?  What?  Did she say new toy? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  For her.  And then debunked it a little bit saying, well, not that new.  Yeah, but how she gets away with it is that she's just so old that even, there's nothing  arousing or even interesting about it.  No.  And you take out your handy-dandy little.  Handy-dandy.  Oh.  She sounds like she's talking about antiques, trying to figure out, like, how much they're  worth.  Yeah.  This is great.  This is a handy-dandy.  This is new.  It's an old friend of mine, Eli Whitney.  It's called the cotton gin. 
[02:14:00]  Break it out and use it.  Brand new item.  You show up at that traveling road show where they kind of tell you how much your shit is  worth.  She lifts her dress up.  It's strapped on.  Made of wood.  Signed by Teddy Roosevelt.  That I saw that impressed me is like this, but it has a strap that goes around your thigh.  And the strap has got a hole in it. 
[02:14:30]  So, this is on his thigh.  And then you straddle it and ride up and down on it.  Oh, great.  I see.  You got the picture?  Mm-hmm.  Go to a sex store and ask about strap-on.  What?  More silliness that just makes everyone laugh and uncomfortable.  This woman's all-  You're strapping a-  To your thigh.  She's riding your leg?  She's riding your thigh.  Now on her thigh as she looks at your useless cock.  Yeah, as far as possible from your tiny, insignificant cock. 
[02:15:00]  Could you strap it on your ankle?  Just get me as far away from that useless little nothing noodle.  I don't want to look at that little fleshy pigtail, which did nothing for me.  So, can I just face away from you while fucking your foot?  Can I strap this on one of your friends and not use it and use his cock?  How about some-  While you're on vacation.  Like, just leave.  Why don't-  This is where people don't have the fucking nerve to break up with their boyfriend. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  Dump the guy already.  How about some bubble wrap to shove in that big box of hers?  Maybe she's the problem.  There you go.  A strap-on for your thigh, though.  Yeah, that's pretty embarrassing.  Now you're just taking his cock right out of the equation.  It's useless.  Another bigger cock right next to his, just to remind him.  Yeah, yeah, right, right.  Now, if you didn't think it was small enough, let's just put a real man's cock right next 
[02:16:00]  to it, and you could stare at that.  If that doesn't work, hire Michael Madsen to come over and tie him up and then just fuck  him in front of him.  Chain him to the toilet.  I said him four times in that joke.  Starker Patty.  Oi.  Starker Patty.  Yeah.  Hi.  I think I'm getting an education from this lady.  In fact, I think I would like to have a television show when I'm 75 and give advice.  What kind of advice could you give?  You're a virgin.  Whatever I learn in the next 25 years. 
[02:16:30]  She's talked about things I never heard of.  Patty, you won't learn anything because you won't ever do anything.  You're never going to have sex.  You're 50 years old and you've never had a man.  I might surprise you one of these days.  When?  Oh, one of these days.  I don't know.  Have you been dating?  Have you been dating at all?  No, not yet, but I will.  In fact, I have this idea that I would like to put my picture on the internet and write 
[02:17:00]  a brief bio and just put myself out there.  Those relationships always work well.  Very funny, but you never know.  All right, listen.  What have you learned from this old broad?  You said you learned a few things.  Well, I...  And heard about things you never heard of before.  Oh, God.  What was she saying a few minutes ago?  Talking about, like, sex toys and things like that.  Yeah.  But what is this enlarger?  I don't know what she was referring to there.  You learned nothing.  You learned nothing, Patty. 
[02:17:30]  Patty, trust me, your snatch doesn't need an enlarger.  Yeah.  A credit card will do the job.  Very funny.  You're 50 and you're a virgin.  How does that even happen?  Oh, I don't know.  I might not be one at 51.  I might have a lot of catching up to do.  What?  You have prospects out there?  Not yet, but if I put my picture on the internet...  Yeah, you put your picture on the internet.  You're going to get some...  That'll work.  Restarea.com.  Yeah.  Yeah, what site are you looking to put your picture up on, Patty? 
[02:18:00]  I don't know yet.  I have to restart it.  Well, you can start by putting the picture up on monster.com.  Oh, very funny.  Isn't that job?  Yeah.  I was trying to come up with websites as fast as I can.  Monster.com.  You know where your head belongs?  On Ogresh.  Here we go.  Let the bit begin.  One thing that was interesting was the plastic...  Ask Gabe.com. 
[02:18:30]  What?  One thing that was interesting was the plastic wrap thing that she mentioned yesterday,  but won't you suffocate?  Won't you die before you finally get any sex?  Well, if you were getting a hot Carl, would you want the plastic?  No, but she talks about wrapping yourself up with plastic.  Yeah, that's if you're getting a hot Carl.  You would wrap yourself in plastic.  You ever want to get a hot Carl when you start having sex?  What's a hot Carl?  Well, you like to have a hot lunch, don't you?  Yeah, I like hamburgers and stuff like that. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, whatever.  However.  Whatever.  However.  That's a hot lunch to me.  Hot to me.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But anyway, does she have a book yet?  I'll go get it.  She is the worst.  Sucker Patty, you're not going to learn anything from her.  Oh, okay.  But I don't know.  She just seems interesting.  I mean, I grew up listening to Dr. Ruth Westheimer.  I had to keep the radio down low.  My foster parents would have...  And look what good that did for you. 
[02:19:30]  You're still a virgin.  You didn't learn anything from her either.  Well, no.  Would you ever ride a thigh strap-on?  Well, no.  I grew up in a lot of religious pressure and stuff from them.  You know, when they were psychologically.  Why don't you go buy a sex toy?  Start with that.  Yeah.  Patty, do you have a vibrator or anything?  Loosen yourself up down there.  I used to, but, you know, when I tried to turn it on one day, it wouldn't work.  So I threw it out.  Even a vibrator said, screw this. 
[02:20:00]  The vibrator said, no.  Denied by your vibrator.  Hey, Stalker Patty, you want to come in and give sex advice to our listeners?  Oh, that would be a fun bit, wouldn't it?  There you go.  That could be a good segment.  People call in with their sex questions for Stalker Patty.  Right.  Yeah, how about I come up with this Thursday?  Hold on.  We got a trucker that wants to see what you're all about.  Freak Show, what's up?  Oh, no.  Hey, I want to bring Stalker Patty to Kentucky and me and my fresh out of prison bride 
[02:20:30]  just treat her the way she should be treated.  Oh, I'm not into threesomes, though.  I've got to have the guy ultimately go.  She's not into threesomes.  You're not into anything.  You're not into onesomes.  You're not into anything of onesomes.  Until you try it the first time, you have no idea what you're into.  I even had a nice Rottweiler.  Come on.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't want to go to Kentucky.  No?  That's why she doesn't mind fucking the dog, just as long as it's not in Kentucky.  Right.  Not Kentucky. 
[02:21:00]  I'm not into that bestiality.  Come on down to Kentucky and fuck a dog.  I don't know.  I hate flying.  Oh, Patty.  Oh, Patty.  You're a mess.  You really have nothing going on as far as that goes.  Oh, you never know.  I mean, you've gotten your life together, but you're still, you know, not sexually active.  Well, that's the most part of my life I have to work on, my love life.  Got to work on that.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah.  A little distracted here.  Can I just say, what's going on Fox right now, there's an emergency landing attempt in 
[02:21:30]  Fort Lauderdale.  It's a little Cessna plane or whatever, and it's live.  And what's happening is they are rooting for it to crash.  One of the many airports in Fort Lauderdale, you know.  It's flying fine, though.  It looks fine, doesn't it?  Some of the islands.  As you look at the gear there, it appears that everything is down, and maybe through  an abundance of caution, this pilot is going to burn off all of that extra fuel, because 
[02:22:00]  it does appear that the landing gear is down.  Maybe it is not down all the way, though.  I don't think it looks all the way down.  If it's not down all the way, if it's not completely locked, then certainly that gear  could collapse and bring about the kind of problem that we told you about earlier.  This camera shot that we have all set up for it, we're told, is not down all the way.  Yeah, it doesn't look down.  Yeah, you get dopey ass.  The plane is from the Bahamas.  It's a beach craft. 
[02:22:30]  Hey, King Air.  Dude, they'll never show this plane crash.  Oh, no, I don't know about that.  They should have always been shot the other day.  So it does sound like it's still one of the commuter airlines.  It's always on delay, I'm telling you.  Oh, no, no, no, because there's no specific human violence.  It's just that it's an exam.  They'll show it.  It's from Lauderdale's Executive Air Force.  Oh, Jesus, Jim.  That was really good.  Again, the landing gear, the rear main gear, apparently not.  How long is this going to take?  How long is this going to take?  The pilot probably will try to cycle the gear. 
[02:23:00]  You might see that.  I think I've seen that.  They're desperate for a crash.  That's why they don't film positive shit.  Come to Newark Airport.  There's 100 safe landings.  There you go.  You want to film a safe landing?  Whatever is causing it to stick, to release.  Now, here's one of the dangers here.  I think we know what the dangers are.  The pilot can get so distracted trying to deal with his immediate problem that he forgets  to fly the airplane.  Oh, and we're hoping for that.  And a simple thing can happen.  He might lose airspeed.  He might point the nose of the aircraft to super high. 
[02:23:30]  This is where they tell you everything that could happen.  And called what's called a stall.  That simply means that the wing doesn't have enough wind to flow it over.  This is going to be like one of those Robbie Knievel stunts.  Yeah.  There's all this horseshit danger for 45 minutes, and then he just makes it every time.  He makes it perfectly.  Yeah.  You need to watch his dad when he was on that 12,000-pound huffy.  Trying to jump over Greyhound buses.  Damn guy doesn't even pull a muscle.  Yeah.  And nothing happens to him.  Robbie Knievel always makes it. 
[02:24:00]  You're so right, man.  Evil sprawled out in front of Caesar's palace with every bone in his body busted.  Because he used a real bike.  It wasn't all jacked up.  And they didn't have computers estimating speed.  It was just Evil going, yeah, I'll hit about 80 and fly over this.  Yeah, I think I can make this one.  Get my Harley out of the garage.  He used the same freaking bike that he just cruised around town with.  Robbie stinks.  He does stink.  The shock exorbers.  Did you see that thing on Evil Knievel? 
[02:24:30]  I think it was on, I know it was in the Oxygen Network.  I don't know.  Something in the 80s.  And they were talking, he had absolutely no science whatsoever.  He would just kind of eyeball the ramp and just be like, a couple inches over this way.  Yeah, you'd eyeball stuff and figure, if I go that fast, I should make it.  Yeah, he would just put the throttle down.  Yep.  Now it's all calculated and nothing ever goes wrong.  It's not thrill-seeking.  If the gear collapses, it could veer any which way. 
[02:25:00]  It could cartwheel.  Any number of things could happen.  That's why burning off the excess fuel is one of the primary goals of the planet.  Would that happen?  I had no idea that could happen.  I thought it was okay when the landing gear didn't come down.  According to this expert, I figured as long as any part of the plane was touching the ground.  Yeah, you could land on the wing.  You could do whatever you wanted.  Turn it upside down.  Yeah.  This is really informative.  King Air, a beach King Air.  It's actually a multi-million dollar aircraft.  Now, if you walk into the propeller while it's on, is that a bad thing? 
[02:25:30]  I hope he brings that topic up as we wait for the next three hours as this guy dumps fuel.  Yeah, really?  It's imminent.  We'll take a peek over there, and we've got to go to the phone here.  Hello?  He's going in a bunch of different directions.  Hello?  Anthony Federov.  Hey, how you doing?  It's Anthony Federov from American Idol.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Anthony, of course, was eliminated last week.  Oh, thanks for reminding me, man.  Well, something tells me you think about it every minute. 
[02:26:00]  Now, what do you think went wrong?  Why do you think America voted for the other people a little more than for you?  I don't know.  You know, it's just, it wasn't, I guess it wasn't meant to happen.  I'm just, you know, I'm not complaining, though.  I'm grateful for every second that I got on that show.  It's been an amazing ride for me.  Sounds like an athlete.  He's like an athlete-speak right now. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Did he get it done, you know?  And do you think Simon bashing you for so long might have had an impact on some of the  people's voting?  Actually, I don't, because he made me stronger.  Like, I really, really love him for it.  Really?  Yeah.  Because, you know.  I don't know.  He was bashing you pretty good, and that might have influenced some of the, you know,  the weaker-minded people around the country that are voting.  Might have actually, yeah, well, if Simon doesn't like him, then.  What's that? 
[02:27:00]  Sheldon?  You have other people on the line here?  Hello?  I can barely hear you guys.  Is there a carjacking going on in the background?  Is this a party line?  I'm hearing other voices there, Anthony.  No, it's just, I'm like walking, actually.  I'm walking in Manhattan right now.  Oh, you're in New York City.  Where are you?  Yeah, I'm, uh.  Standing right now on the West 48th and America's Avenue.  Why didn't they have you come in here?  You're like right down the street.  Why don't you just come in?  I wish.  We're going like, we're doing a lot of things right now.  I'm going to Tony Danza's show. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, you're doing the Danza's show.  That's cool.  I'm going to Danza's show.  He's actually a big Opie and Anthony fan.  Yeah.  We've had him on the show.  We've had him on the show.  He's great.  Yeah, he'll freak out if you mention us.  Yeah, well, I'm going to, you know, I'm definitely going to do that.  Hey, Anthony, a friend of mine was saying that what happened was with the voting and stuff,  do you think that the voting was somehow biased because one group is going to look at something  and then it's just going to happen like boom?  You know what?  I don't even know.  I never even thought about it because I really, I honestly, like I gave up on trying to figure 
[02:28:00]  it out.  Really?  Because the more you think about it, the harder it is going to be for you.  So I'm like, you know, I think when I sang the Celine Dion song, like I really felt like  I, you know, that was one of my better performances.  I ended up in the bottom two.  So when I was standing there, you know, during the commercial break with Constantine, I just  told to myself, I'm like, you know what?  I give up trying to figure it out.  Really?  Because, you know, I had worse performances and, you know, I was safe and I had a better 
[02:28:30]  performance and I ended up in the bottom two.  So I just, you know, that actually gave me a lot of, you know, just took a lot of pressure  off my shoulders.  Let me ask you, when you first get involved in a process like this, I mean, when you first  get involved in what could be a long process like this, do you actually in a weird  way kind of envision a certain thing that you're not too sure of where it was going  to come from?  Say that again.  I'm sorry.  Like when something like this starts, this process of going through this long competition, 
[02:29:00]  do you at one point envision yourself coming to a point where you're like, all right, well,  you know, that was what it was, but I'm not, you know.  Oh, God, this is, I, I, you're like, you're talking and you're breaking up on, I'm on the  cell phone.  No, it's a, it's a really good question.  One more time, Jimmy, please.  Like you, you, you, you want it, you obviously, you want to start this process of going to  American Idol and hopefully winning the whole thing because it, now, is there a point when  you're in this process, when you're kind of looking at the way things are going and you're  like, all right, man, it's going well, the voting is up, but then again, next week, you're 
[02:29:30]  going to like have something happen and you're just not too sure what, you know?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, you know, like I, I went through some, you know, through some days like that.  I just, um, you know, I, I kind of, um, it's a great question.  It is.  It's a very good question.  I just kind of, I just give up trying to answer it, you know, I try to give up trying  to figure things out because, uh, it's, you know, it's, it's tough.  Dude, there's so many variables because it's not only the talent, it's a matter of, it's 
[02:30:00]  like, like, uh, was, was like my, my friend said, is Simon's, uh, criticism going to mean  anything or all these other things going to come into play because what, what do you think  about, like, as far as being a contestant, a lot of people had you picked to win this.  Uh, what do you think about as far as certain factors and having, like having hindsight now  with that?  Well, I think there's a, you know, definitely a lot of factors play into, you know, the way  the votes go and the way people, uh, the way people vote.  Absolutely.  You know, and it's just the, I think the secret to trying, you know, to actually trying 
[02:30:30]  to be successful is not to pay attention to any of these factors because you, they will  talk about the factors.  Right, right, right.  What factors do you feel might've contributed?  Like if you're going to drink out of a mule or something, like what factors do you think  might have contributed?  Uh, um, you know, like I've been, uh, I've been pretty, pretty down on myself.  That was a very big factor because I'm very, very, very critical of what I do. 
[02:31:00]  I'm never happy with the things that I'm doing.  So, uh, the biggest factor I think that really affected me is the fact that I put a lot of  pressure on myself.  Are you bummed that Paula didn't pick you?  No, I'm not.  You know, she's a sweetie and like, honestly, like she's been helping us and supporting us.  In what ways?  She's been helping us all season like she's in very, in normal, civilized, normal ways.  Was that actually distracting at all? 
[02:31:30]  Because we had played some of that audio and a lot of people were saying that that might  be distracting to the contestants.  And then my friend is like, I don't think it will be.  And I'm like, yeah, but.  Not at all.  Because you know what?  We actually found out about the whole thing like two weeks into it because we're doing  so many things there and we just don't have time to focus on it.  So, uh, you know, it did not bother us at all.  Yeah.  But, you know, we did try, we do try to support her as much as we can because she's a sweetie,  you know.  She's been not a very good person.  Any truth to the fact that you're going to be involved with the Rich Voss pilot?  With the what? 
[02:32:00]  The Rich Voss pilot.  Uh, what is that?  He, Rich Voss, he's an actor.  He's got this pilot.  Uh, we were hearing all kinds of things.  Are you being approached by a lot of, uh, people?  Uh, I'm being approached by, yeah, by people.  But, uh, you know, I haven't, uh.  Like who?  Just, um, just people in general.  I mean, if you're talking about the fans, you know, like, people come up to me all the  time.  Right.  He's approaching you.  You have two weeks left.  I hear you.  Wow.  Well, that's very, that's very cool. 
[02:32:30]  And, of course, you'll be involved in the tour that goes around.  That's going to be great.  That's nice.  Hooking up with the people again.  Yeah, it's going to be awesome.  You mean, it must be being a lot of girls, man.  That kind of TV exposure.  How is the female situation?  It's cool, man.  You know, but I'm the type of person, I only need one.  Like, is, uh, maybe I sound a little bit dorky, but, uh, I only need one.  No, that's very sweet and very sincere.  I like that.  You're a better man than me.  Pathetic.  Ah, stop it.  Dude, if I get any TV time, all I want to do is find a bunch of, you know, people and  give them Roman war helmets and stuff. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, you're just crazy.  Jimmy.  You bitter?  Are you bitter at all about being, uh, being, like, kind of like, you know, voted off and  stuff?  I'm just a little bit disappointed in myself because, uh, I honestly feel like if, if I  would have had more performances like I had on Tuesday, I, you know, maybe I still  would have been on the show because I'm so much better than I've shown.  And that, you know, there's only one person to blame for that and that's myself because  I put a lot of extra stress on myself that I shouldn't have. 
[02:33:30]  Don't be so hard on yourself.  I actually had you, uh, picked to win.  I actually was, uh, you know, I was very disappointed when you were, uh, eliminated.  Well, I appreciate that.  Yeah.  You keep saying how you're hard on yourself.  Uh, what went wrong?  What, what, what do you think you did wrong?  You know what?  I just, I just honestly think that I got caught up in trying to figure out the magic formula  to be successful on this show.  Right.  You know, H plus IV equals, right, right, right, right.  You know, cause like in the beginning of the show, like I had a couple of good performances 
[02:34:00]  in the beginning.  Um, you know, that's when I started to have fun.  Like it was all new and exciting for me.  Like when you get.  It's like the Celine Dion songs, right?  What's that?  The Celine Dion song?  What about him?  Which one did you sing?  Yeah.  I did, I Surrender.  Oh, cool, man.  Yeah.  I love that song.  So, you know, and I just like, I had a couple of times this season where I had good performances,  but a lot of times I just like, I'm like, maybe if I choose this song, people will like  it.  And maybe I do this, I do that.  And like I said, I, I shouldn't have done it.  I should have just, you know, just sang and not think about anything else. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  You're going to have, you know, because of this, you're going to have, um, a great career  ahead of you, I mean, and, uh, you, you know, you know what I mean?  Because you, you know, that you've gotten so much exposure and, uh, you know, hopefully  the head, you understand that definitely it's going to be a huge, huge bump for your career.  Oh, absolutely.  And that's, that's exactly why I will never complain about, you know, what happened and  the fact that I got voted off because it has given me a priceless, priceless start  that I would have never gotten in my life.  There you go. 
[02:35:00]  Just like all the other American Isles that came before you.  Right.  Yeah.  I remember a lot of their names.  Yep.  That's it.  There was, uh, Clay Aiken.  Clay Aiken.  He won one of those.  Oh, no, he didn't win, Opie.  Oh.  He was second.  That's right.  Oh, he came in second.  He lost to Patrice.  And he's, uh, selling many, uh, yeah, he lost to Patrice O'Neal.  And then after Clay Aiken's, there was, uh, um.  Mm-hmm.  Um, yeah.  No, that, that first guy, the guy's name was, uh, no, there's, there's Kelly Clarkson. 
[02:35:30]  No.  There you go.  Remember her?  Oh, okay.  I remember her, sort of.  That's on the first season.  Ruby Studdard.  Ruben won, uh.  There's been some huge names out of that program.  Uh-huh.  All right.  But then after that, there was, um.  Justin.  There was that Leif Garrett-looking guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  Our time is up with you.  Oh, no.  Anthony Fedoroff.  I don't want to go.  What are you going to sing on Identity?  Because we'll tune in and watch.  Yeah, definitely.  What's that?  What are you going to sing on Danza today?  We'll tune in and watch you.  I, I, I don't think I'll be singing.  No?  But I'll definitely say, hey, how you doing? 
[02:36:00]  There you go.  You're going to say hi to us?  Uh, give us a little shout-out?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, you, you should do that, because we work for the same company.  It'd be great for everybody.  Tony loves us.  Yeah, we've had him on.  He's actually a great guest, and he almost told me.  He's a regular on the show, as a matter of fact, yeah.  Yeah, not a, I, I'll definitely give you guys a shout-out.  All right, buddy.  Have a great show, and, uh, we're glad you called in.  Thanks a lot for all the support.  Appreciate it.  All right.  There he goes.  It was Anthony Fedoroff from American Idol.  He came in.  All right.  Very good interview.  Oh, he was the worst.  I was so glad when he got kicked off.  I know.  I was rooting for him to get kicked off, like, weeks before he did. 
[02:36:30]  Even that fat kid got kicked off before him.  They should have kept the fat kid.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that the one who, uh, beat up his girlfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  With that irritating beard.  Oh.  Oh, thank God.  He was like a wigger kind of kid, you know?  Ugh.  Yeah, you ever notice, like, those white kids who are trying to, uh, pass to the other side?  You always have to have your hair cut, like, really short.  Yep, yep.  So no one realizes that you have, uh, Aryan hair.  Aryan hair, of course.  It's so straight, not the least bit kinky. 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  I think the plane landed safely, or-  Did it?  Or it's going to, yeah.  I thought they were still burning off fuel.  They're burning fuel still.  Yeah, burning off fuel.  Believe me, they'll cut into this commercial in a second if they have to.  All right, uh, we have one more clip from Sue Johansson, the grandma, giving out, uh,  sex advice, Anthony.  We're going back to the lick, kiss, suck thing.  Debunking the deep throat fantasy.  Oh, here's where she talks about BJ's again?  Uh, yeah, I think this is a different, uh, different one there, Bill.  She has it all wrong.  She doesn't believe in, uh, women-  Deep throat.  Deep throating.  Oh, honey, honey. 
[02:37:30]  Don't take the whole penis in your mouth.  That advice.  This is, this is not what you do.  You don't take this whole penis in your mouth.  You're going to gag for sure.  And what's wrong with that?  Yeah, and what better way to punish someone than to have her stomach bile coming up all  over your rotten mule?  What more satisfying tear and stomach bile?  Jesus, Jimmy.  What more satisfying tear and stomach bile equals good hummer? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, that's a mathematical formula.  Oh, for sure.  Never, never.  Look, the sensitive part of the penis is right there and right around there and right around  the tip here.  This has some sensitivity, yeah, but not, not all that much.  How would you know?  Yeah.  So you're going to perform oral sex on him.  Just bury it in the back of your throat.  You can lick and kiss and suck and do whatever you like and do that up the shaft of the penis 
[02:38:30]  and along the side and around to his testicles.  Hey, no problem.  And then you take just the head of his penis in your mouth.  Oh, my God.  That is the worst advice ever.  This is the second time I'm hearing her do this.  And it's awful.  She sounds like she gives head.  It probably looks like a baby billy goat nursing.  That's what I'm picturing.  That little animal mouth.  That's really disgusting, Jim.  Please, Jesus.  Just suckling for that life-giving milk.  You know what you're doing? 
[02:39:00]  Just the tip.  Yeah.  Hold it with two fingers.  Yeah.  Using her logic, it would be the same thing as if during sex, just because all the sensitivities  of the tip, just put the tip in and just kind of move that around.  You don't need to stick the whole thing in.  That won't feel as good.  This woman's out of her mind.  Out of her mind.  In your mouth.  That's all.  And you drool.  I like that.  Great quantities of saliva down the shaft of his penis. 
[02:39:30]  That sounds biblical.  And then you rip the penis very gently with your hand, and you coordinate hand-mouth movements.  So it's like...  We are drooled great quantities of saliva with the New Deal.  Drooling is probably sexy, but not from her, because you know where it smells like Sanka?  Sanka.  Oh, here we go, boys.  Geritol.  Oh, the pilot has flown out over the Everglades, dumped some fuel, and now he's apparently going to bring that thing in for a landing. 
[02:40:00]  You can see the propellers are slowing, and he's going to, if he can, shut them down completely so that they are not spinning.  He's going to be able to just come into a full gliding landing.  Crash!  Crash!  Crash!  Because he'll want to avoid doing damage to the props and the engines as much as possible, so that something can be salvaged.  He's assuming he can get his plane down on the ground.  Could be just a normal landing.  You don't know what's going to happen.  It is Geraldo.  Pictures coming to you now from the skies over Fort Lauderdale. 
[02:40:30]  There are seven people on board this plane.  They're just losing their brains.  They're apparently coming in for a landing.  There we go.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Live on Fox News.  He's going to want to bring that plane in and land on the main year.  A plane is landing.  A plane is landing.  Got it.  Before bringing it in on the nose wheel.  Just keep talking, reporters.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  He's over the runway.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God. 
[02:41:00]  He's over the runway.  It's a perfect apron.  And he's touching down very, very lightly.  You'll see the puff of smoke.  Rear wheeling the down.  Oh, my God.  It was a perfect landing.  Oh, my God.  It was a perfect landing.  Holy shit.  A sigh of relief from the seven people on board this plane.  Oh, a perfect landing.  Because it looks like a textbook landing.  Nose wheel light on the center line.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of media time here.  In tact.  No collapse.  No sparks.  No sparks.  No fire.  And that motherfucker talked through the whole thing.  Robbie Knievel is going to come out and take off his helmet. 
[02:41:30]  Wave to the crowd.  And perhaps by some of you watching.  Robbie Knievel.  We're going to be updating you on exactly what happened there.  Maybe get some interviews with the pilots or the people on board.  Chuck Leonard, the former NTSB investigator, was on the phone and ex-commercial pilot himself.  Chuck, I guess it couldn't go any better than that, huh?  Yes.  It certainly was excellent.  Obviously, it was an indication problem.  Yeah.  One of the lights was...  And as I saw, it was a perfect landing. 
[02:42:00]  Ba-ba-booey.  Ba-ba-booey.  Ba-ba-booey.  Wow.  Oh.  What did they come down to?  Hoping for a plane crash.  That's it.  Fox should just kill themselves.  They even let him taxi and everything.  Yeah, they're showing the taxi.  I was on a flight that dumped fuel, a United flight one time.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I didn't have any reporters talking, but I got off.  I stood there, shit my pants, and got another plane.  Huffing up.  Wow.  That was something.  Are they going to show them getting their luggage and everything? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, I hope they don't have a carousel.  Yeah.  You know, sometimes the bag comes out a little unstable.  It could cross your fingers.  Yes, there are times where it will shift during the flight.  We're going to have the cameras inside to see if any luggage has shifted.  ...that the plane wound up crashing because they basically just forgot to fly it.  Yes, John, that's exactly right.  Well, now they've got to talk about what could have happened.  What could have happened, which would have been beautiful.  This is why we're justifying why we showed a perfect plane.  It wasn't even a commercial flight.  No.  There are seven people on board.  Exactly. 
[02:43:00]  What a disaster.  I understand they're following now a minivan whose brakes haven't been checked in a couple of months.  Assholes.  It would be good if the plane stopped and then the landing gear collapsed and it just fell in place.  Oh, my God.  Now they've got to go with the replay.  They're replaying and landing safely.  Rear landing gear.  Are you kidding?  I guess they didn't know, Chuck, whether...  This just said one of the passengers spilled some coffee on their lap during the landing.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Now I can understand why they're showing it.  The gear was going to collapse.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  What I suspect happened, John, is that they had a flyby and they could see that the three  gears were down.  Oh, shut up.  They had an indicator light.  God, do I just hate them.  That said that it's a light news day.  So we went.  Can you believe that scumbag reporter yapped through that whole fuck thing?  Yeah.  Media people, you should just be summarily executed.  You really should be.  Telling us what could possibly happen.  You're awful.  The whole list of things.  You've got to admit, that is kind of a skill.  You know he was looking at like his director or something.  You fucking asshole.  Just keep that.  It landed perfectly.  Damn it.  Go to commercial. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  But there was always a chance that it wouldn't have landed perfectly.  Right.  Kind of like the other 45,000 planes that take off every hour on this fucking planet.  You moron.  All right.  The last bit of the Sue Johansson clip and we'll move on to something else here.  What happened now?  We're going live to Newark.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh.  ...of saliva down the shaft of his penis.  And then you grip the penis very gently with your hand and you coordinate hand-mouth movements. 
[02:44:30]  So it's like that.  He just keeps saying he wants deep throat, deep throat.  Of course he does.  Well, if he wants deep throat, then let him use the dildo.  What?  What?  Get her going.  That's too simple.  That's a good one.  Okay.  There we go.  I'll have to tell him that one.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  You're welcome.  Have a good night.  I will.  You too.  I'm going to get on the head with it.  Did you hear what she just said?  She said, she just basically said that deep throating was bullshit.  Okay? 
[02:45:00]  And then the dude in her, the other girl's relationship is like, no, that's what I want.  I want it.  And rather than admitting that she was wrong on her own fucking show, she couldn't handle  it.  She had to say, why don't you tell the guy to take a dildo and shove that down his throat.  Threaten to put stitches in his internal, his intestines if he wants to fucking feel  good because you give awful heads, you rotten prude.  Just the tip.  Please.  That's it for today on her.  There's some beauties on the way.  She's wonderful.  I've got to watch the show.  I don't know when it's on.  I want to watch this old bag, give this advice. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, it's awful.  Saturday at midnight.  Saturday at midnight.  Translucent, veiny hands holding a dildo.  Look.  Old age spots on the back of her hand.  Brown fungus fingernails.  Awful.  All right.  Okay.  I think we took care of her.  I think we dispatched that woman.  Bill Burr in studio.  What are we promoting today, Bill?  I got nothing.  I don't know.  You got a nice new CD out I see in front of us.  Oh.  Where's that? 
[02:46:00]  That's from, yeah, a nice new one taped in 2003.  Oh, really?  What's up with this Bill Clinton?  Is this guy crazy?  Is this guy crazy?  Well, where could they get it?  They might want to get it anyway.  Oh, I can get it off my website.  BillBurr.com?  Yes, sir.  Very nice.  Did you bring any?  I brought like five for the, whatever the hell it was.  The covers.  He just brought covers.  Do you got a CD?  I have the CD.  Do you have the CD?  I want a CD.  Why don't we play one?  Oh, then for charity?  Why don't we play a track going in a burry? 
[02:46:30]  Charity.  Schmarity.  Bill, what should we play?  The end credits.  I haven't even looked at that thing.  Oh, my God.  You have a track called Closing Shit Joke.  What do you want us to play?  Seriously, here.  Let me see.  Give me a little, you know, a little push today.  I got a tinkle.  I know, I know.  I'll be right back.  You gotta do what you gotta do.  Alright.  Alright.  Track.  Track.  Uh, I haven't done any of this shit in a long time.  Let me, how about we go with...  Okay.  Uh, how about number five? 
[02:47:00]  We'll go with George Bush.  He's still in office.  Alright.  It's Bill Burr.  We'll dump the, uh, the Nixon jokes that I did in the beginning of the CD.  Alright.  So I was watching, uh, George Bush today.  Give some sort of speech, or try to, I should say.  You guys like George Bush?  No.  No.  You know what I like about George Bush?  He makes me feel like I could be president, too.  You know?  He's like the first guy from, like, my reading level.  You know what I mean?  The first guy from my math class to actually make it, you know? 
[02:47:30]  He's the worst.  You know what I love about that guy?  He can't say the word terror.  He uses the word every speech.  He can't say terror.  He goes, tear.  That's it.  He goes, America will not stand for tear.  Anybody who supports tear?  You're a tear-ist?  We're gonna get you.  What kind of president goes, we're gonna get you? 
[02:48:00]  He's like some redneck they dragged out of a barbecue.  Put him in a suit.  Dude, if you go, we're gonna get you.  You should be just standing on stage with, like, a couple of bloodhounds going,  Go get him, Blue!  Smell the shirt!  Get the scent!  Go get him!  Damn, that Blue's a good dog!  Oh!

[02:51:00]  You trust too much to fail  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you  Bill Burr in studio today, helping us out  Definitely having a good time today  Absolutely, that  Chewbacca's on Regis right now  That perfect landing was really exciting  Glad I came in, I would have still been sleeping and missed it  Tony's on?  Yeah, Tony Danza's on  Did you guys see what Fox was showing while we were on break?  It was pretty interesting 
[02:51:30]  There was a guy on 57th Street, parallel parking  And everything was smooth, he didn't ding the bumper or nothing  Wow  Yeah, it was a little nerve-wracking  Because what happens is sometimes you'll hit a bumper, scratch the paint  It was really kind of crazy  Yeah, talk about what could have happened  Yeah, well, you know, sometimes if somebody walks in front of you  You could back their foot over and have a whole lawsuit  Well, the reason they sent the camera crews there was  It was a tight spot  Right  It seemed a little tight  And there might have been some paint on a bumper  Perhaps  Did he drive around the block and dump fuel?  He drove around  Well, it was actually a woman 
[02:52:00]  That's why they said let's  Ah, right  And she appeared to be Indian  This is going to be a problem  But it turned out to be alright  She actually swung it in there and no problem  Nobody got hurt, thank God  I'm going to have to check the replay later  Let's say hi to Tim  Hey, Tim  Yes, sir  Howdy, Tim  What's up, Tim?  I was just watching CNN  And they had a quote from Eric Logan  They said, you know, when you put a plane about to crash on TV  A lot of people will watch  He's doing his hat from Winocky impression, too 
[02:52:30]  Oh, there's a crash  All right  Let's take some kind of weird vote here  We could talk about Robert Blake on CNN  We could talk about  Oh, Robert Blake  Pint-sized terrors  Pre-kindergarten kids are being expelled  Yeah, that makes sense  In the tri-state area  Yeah, why?  Because they're little animals 
[02:53:00]  They're little animals with no supervision  Running around  Hundreds of three- and four-year-old pint-sized terrors  Were bounced from public and private schools alike  For bad behavior  Ranging from  Uh-huh  Rape  Pulling down classmates' pants  Close  Mastering  To slipping water guns into class  Water gun  Well, the reason they're expelling them  Is because they put so many rules on little kids these days  With what they can bring in  They have mandatory, no-tolerance suspension 
[02:53:30]  So if you bring a water gun in  Which used to be nothing  Right  Now you get suspended  But is this worth being on the front page of the New York paper today?  Dude, they're showing a plane safely land on the news  Good point  Today is pretty much a news-free day  Yeah, we really need to help out the news again  There's nothing going on  Let's get a couple in a mosque and see what we can get done  Oh, today is absolutely one of those days  We would do something really stupid  Yeah  It would be today  We always messed up on slow news days  On days like this where we would say the mayor's dead 
[02:54:00]  Or send a couple into St. Pat's  Yeah, sure  Maybe you send a couple into a mosque  And the man will just talk us equals  That's a big scandal  Shake things up  It's a non-story  Stop, wait, wait, wait, wait  What happened?  Ellen's dancing  Oh  I'm sorry, Anthony  I have to watch  All right, hold on  Oh, my God  Oh, she's sickening  Nothing brings out the anger in me  That's right  Is this just awful?  Should have laid back and do the stepdad  Yeah  Just close your eyes 
[02:54:30]  Put your feet in the air  Pretend you're anywhere but there  Oh, she's still in coats  Oh  Oh, my God  You know they're standing in line  I hope she steals my coat  Of course  I'm going to put mine right on the chair  So she takes it  Yeah  And then gives it to someone else  I'm going to make it really sick  I taped the picture of a cock  To the inside of my jacket  Wait until she picks this up  Wow, she didn't want anything  To do with that guy  You see that?  Of course  She was dancing down the aisle  This guy was giving her a little move  And she just turned her back on him 
[02:55:00]  Wouldn't it be great  If she took someone's coat  Put it on your chair  And you slipped some cocaine  In the pocket  And then called the cops  On the person  When they leave the studio  Where's that little clock?  They stopped the clock  Why?  I don't know  It's such a good little character  Where's the clock  I love that gimmick  That was a good gimmick  That was a great gimmick  Dancing here today  A little intimidating  You think she'll talk about being a  Oh, that's going to be good  Oh, well  She was intimidated by dancing  Because Brittany's on 
[02:55:30]  Today  You think she'll talk about her abuse  On her own show?  This is their first time ever together  In an interview  And they chose us  So thank you very much for them  Coming here with us  And they are talking about  Their reality show Chaotic  Which is going to be coming on soon  What they're doing  They're mixing business with pleasure  And all of this show is pleasure  So really they're mixing pleasure with pleasure  And then when it's pleasure with pleasure  You know what you get?  Oh, that Ellen  And here for the first time 
[02:56:00]  The Backstreet Boys are here  Oh, yeah  Oh, B  That's a hot show  I want to know  We forget sometimes  That we're actually doing a show  We're actually doing a show  I know  We're just sitting here and watching TV  We're just watching TV  You know what she was doing  In the beginning  I think  Which is that really irritating thing  That stars do  When they show their picture  On the cover of magazines now  And then they just show  Where they were airbrushed  Like  Oh, really?  My cheeks really don't look like that  They're not like that  I'm a lot heavier  I'm just like you  Yeah  I'm just like you  I had some blemishes here 
[02:56:30]  That they took care of  I've seen models  Yeah, models do that  They tape up my hair  And my clothes in the back  Shut up  You've got terrible images  This isn't the real me  And she's still fucking  Penis  Anorexic  I puked right before this segment  It was gorgeous  Are we done with the pre-K children  Getting expelled for outrageous behavior?  Oh, did you finish what they get in trouble for?  That was pretty much it  Pulling down pants?  Pretty much it, yeah  But it's out of control  Supposedly in the New York school system  Oh, Jimmy's buddy Billy Crystal 
[02:57:00]  We got to hear what this is like  I'm sure this is going to be a real laugh riot  It's just an ass slobber fest  We can't sit here and just watch TV  Ass slobber fest  Well, not everybody gets the standing O, you know  Really?  Yeah, that's big  Have they had coffee?  Are they like us?  An espresso drip?  They're really fired up this morning  That's great  I'm fired up because you're here  Oh, I'm so glad to see you  Let me show you  For those people that we go back  We go back a ways  Because we used to play in the softball league together 
[02:57:30]  Is that why you hate him?  By the way  Dukes, my team  Of course it's why you hate him  There's no other reason  There's a senior league  It's not  And you being a Jew  You played awful baseball  Just the politically incorrect Tony Bander  All right  Awful  I wanted to hear their banter  Do you?  Not really  He could really hit the ball  Remember, Rob could really hit the ball 
[02:58:00]  You've got to talk baseball  We all took it  There was all the teams from different television shows  In Los Angeles  All week we've been going  We've got a tough game  We've got a tough game  We're playing Laverne and Shirley  We've got to put a happy day's game  Enough  Bye  There you go  Uh, yeah  Yeah, yeah  I'm not getting in the car  I'm not getting in the car  What the fuck is the car?

Book or fuck up with your book  Should I fucking kill him now?  There it is  I'm sure he keeps going and going  But that is nice  That was fun to listen to  That's a great little relationship  Back to TV  I gotta hear what he sounds like  He's nervous  Look at him  Yeah I wouldn't be too  He's got a Johnny Depp look  They're not doing that for nothing  That's why you're on the cover  Everybody  I mean 
[03:08:30]  Seriously  Well first of all  You deserve it  Just for what you put up with  Why am I so far away from you right now?  Jump in our lap  But really  What you put up with  Is just amazing  So  And thank you for being here  Thank you for having me  And your little sister was here  And she was adorable  Sweet as can be  And we had fun with her  Went nowhere  I'm just too far away  Anyway so  Ricky looks good  I love Ricky  Hi  So you were here 
[03:09:00]  You were single last time  Now you're married  And to him  Look at this guy slouching  And where did you all meet?  Yeah y'all look like a cute couple  Thank you  Where did y'all meet?  We met at Joseph's  A club  It's a nightclub  On a Monday night  A while back  And now  That must be an awkward thing  You know  You just see Brittany  And you think you can just  Go hey how you doing?  Hey actually  It was her that was like  Hey how you doing?  Really?  Uh huh  And then right away 
[03:09:30]  And his pregnant wife  Why don't you bring that up Alan?  Just kind of clicked  Well not right away  I think  The home record  Oh this is bombing  Awful  Yeah  I don't know  They're a pretty charismatic couple  When you got married  What our show or Ellen's?  Well she said  Where'd you meet?  And he actually threw in  It was a Monday  This guy's good on TV  I was wondering  What day of the week  Did they meet?  Yeah  And he answered it  Like it read my mind  It might be annoying  Look at what he's doing though  The way he's sitting  He's exuding  Self-confidence  He really is  I wouldn't be true  If I was banging Brittney Stewart 
[03:10:00]  She proposed  She proposed to him  And uh  These are Ellen's eyes  Look at those bags  Wow  Did he get that way?  No  She should reach over this rabbit  Yeah but it did look like  He wanted to get married  He said love is love  And that's a commitment  She looks like a young  George Washington  Actually I was doing  Just decades at first  I don't know  I slept down  No I told her  You know I told her  That it's not right  For the woman to ask the man  The man's supposed to  Get on one knee  And do it all right  And this and that  Why is he moving his head  Like a black woman 
[03:10:30]  Exactly  Whatever  Exactly  So then  You then had to turn around  And ask her  Yeah it took me about  Five minutes  And I turned around  Really?  That's sweet  That was heartfelt  Took my mouth out of her beaver  And said sure  Now that's all thought  For being like that  I'm just going to keep moving around  And so what is the best part  About being married?  The sex  Say it  Um  Do you see it?  The baby?  Oh boy  The baby?  No I said  She said what's the best part  About being married  I don't know 
[03:11:00]  Are you now?  I mean I  Wow  She saved them  The makeups from the arguments  Are the best part  Yeah  Um  Now you know what  I  Married or not  I just  I love  Being with her  I mean she's fun  Aww  She's fun  She's fun  Because every picture  Really that I see  You are just laughing  And looking like you're having fun  All the time  I mean you can't be serious  All the time  Mention the guy's other family 
[03:11:30]  Holy shit  Yeah but you look like  You're laughing all the time  You look like you're having fun  And also you're having fun  With the fact  I mean because there really is nothing  Dude he left his chick  That was pregnant  For Brittany  I don't blame him  She was on her back  He would have stepped on her stomach  To get to Brittany  And he would have been right  No one would have convicted him for it  But why is it no one bringing that up  That's the obvious  Wait she was pregnant  Yeah  He was married  I don't know if they were separated  Or officially divorced  Whatever  But his ex definitely was pregnant 
[03:12:00]  With another kid for him  She's putting on weight  And let people in  And show that you have nothing to hide  And just kind of put it out there  Instead of  Nothing to hide  Really  And so  And so you actually  And you read all the magazines too  Right  It'd be funny if he leaves her  When she's pregnant  No I look at the pictures really  Or maybe not  Are we done with this?  Yeah  Ken Federline is a pretty charismatic guy  Shut up  I like listening to him talk  You are so full of shit  I like his like  The way he's like  Access kind of 
[03:12:30]  Lilts cool  Pore fest  Under a magnifying glass  Right?  Yeah  I mean I wouldn't say  It's completely hard  It gets on you sometimes  You know it has itself  His mouth is so dry  He is so nervous  Yeah  Who I'm with  I love her  I love her  Everything else  Whatever  That was a great point  Yeah  You have no point  There really is no way  For you to  I mean even with this show  It's like I don't think  That that's  Fueling the flame  It's just  They're going to be there  Anyway  Whether you show them 
[03:13:00]  What's going on inside or not  And now you're just  Showing the flame  There's nothing special  About your life  You just do what you do  Exactly  Right?  And now  The baby  That's very exciting  Now you have to be  Really excited  You were selling the show  Pretty convincingly  Wow  Watch these two  Colored cinema  They're not even  Ellen's doing all the talking  And they're here to promote  A reality show  Of them  With a camera following  You're not showing yet  The last time you were here  You were teaching me  Some sit-ups  That you claim to do  A thousand a day  Which 
[03:13:30]  You know  I'm doing fifty a day  I don't think you do  A thousand a day  Fifty is killing me  Really you didn't  Roll in a staircase  And have him kick her down  That's the exercise I do  I lay on my back  And he does push-ups  Over my face  All right  But he talks  In his little rap accent  Makes me nauseous  But then again  I'm sitting here  With fucking four zilches  And he's fucking  Britney Spears  It's a nerve of me  To criticize him  He's doing something right  Yeah  Fat pig  Anthony what do you know

[03:20:00]  Bill Burr  Sitting in with us today  Go to BillBurr.com  To see what he's up to  Is this story true you think Ant?  You're doing some investigating over there I see  Well I just checked Snopes.com  My favorite site for checking out urban legends and rumors and myths 
[03:20:30]  And it hasn't popped up as true or false or anything  It's just not there  Maybe the story's too new  If it's true it could be the greatest story ever  I would hope they would add this and dispel it if it's false or say that it's true  Here we go  A lion mutilates 42 midgets in Cambodian ring fight  Spectators cheered as an entire Cambodian midget fighting league  An entire Cambodian midget fighting league?  Squared off against an African lion  Who knew there were midget fighting leagues over there? 
[03:21:00]  Hold on there Billy I'm sorry  The fight was slated when an angry fan contested  Yang  Sihamani  President of the CMFL  That can't be real  It's bullshit  Because why would the acronym be  In English like that?  CMFL  This is so fake  Cambodian midget fighting league  Yeah  Claiming that one lion could defeat his entire league of 42 fighters 
[03:21:30]  Sihamani  Takes great pride  In the league he helped create  As was conveyed in a recent advertising campaign for the CMFL  That stated his midgets will  Take on anything  Man, beast, or machine  I guess they set up this match between an African lion  It was shipped to centrally located Kampong Chang  Wow  Kampong Chang  That was a good try  Especially  Chang 
[03:22:00]  C-H-H-N  That's bullshit  A with a  Over the A  And they put an African lion  Panthera Leo  In parentheses  Yeah  No one would write that in a news story  The official lion name  No one would do that  Well, it's a sanctioned fight, Jim  Right  I mean, the lion has to have a name  Good point  The event which took place Saturday, April 30th  In the city's Coliseum  The Cambodian government allowed the fight to take place  Under the condition they received a 50% commission on each ticket sold  And that no cameras would be allowed in the arena 
[03:22:30]  Ah, no evidence  Right  That's bullshit  Of course  The fight was called in only 12 minutes  After which 28 fighters were declared dead  While the other 14 suffered severe injuries  Including broken bones and lost limbs  Rendering them unable to fight back  So what, they just waved the towel  And the lion was like, you know  Put his paws in the air  It's over  They just called it  T-K-O  C-H-H-M-A-N-I  Was quoted before the fight  Stating that he felt  Since his fighters outnumbered the lion 42 to 1  That they could outwit and outmuscle the lion 
[03:23:00]  Unfortunately  He was wrong  I don't believe this  How do you outwit a lion?  Exactly  A couple of brain teasers  I declare shenanigans  Oh, hey  I'm foolery  This is bullshit  Erica, what's up?  Hello, Erica?  Hey, how are you?  Good girl  Hi, girl  Hi, what's up?  We're talking to you  Let's go  Um, I just  Did you see how that article's fake? 
[03:23:30]  How?  It says it on there  Did you see this  Turn out of the seats  Somewhere on it?  I don't know exactly where it was  But we were all reading it work  And then all of a sudden  Someone caught it  That says this article  Or it says like fake news  Or something of that sort on it  Oh, really?  So you guys declared shenanigans as well  Yes, we did  Well, I don't see anything  That says fake news on this one  Oh, right here  Yeah  I'm sorry?  Oh, is that it right there?  No, it's over there  Right 
[03:24:00]  Got it?  Yeah  Yeah, no  Alright, thank you  Ted in South Dakota  Ted?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, Ted  The article's absolutely fake  It's a guy and his friends  Would argue about  40 midgets versus a lion  So he wrote up  A little press release  For a group of friends  Showed it to the guy  And it somehow got leaked  Somehow?  He says  It got leaked?  Kind of leaked  Like they're in the White House  Yeah  It got leaked  Leaked out of the circle of friends  Wasn't supposed to go out 
[03:24:30]  And then some of the Alfa's news  Took it and said, wow  You know what this could do  To our re-election?  National security  Come on  It somehow got leaked  Yeah, it got leaked  Bunch of dope smoking pot  In their apartment  And somehow  It got leaked  Right, Jesus  Like I'm leaking this call  This is awful  Goodbye  Alright  Thanks, Ted  Jesus  Brother Joe in the studio  Looking really pissed off  Traffic sucks, man  Traffic's always fun  We left at 8 o'clock  We left Long Island at 8 o'clock  Three hours 
[03:25:00]  That's a good time  To leave  Rush hour  Fucking worst place  The pinnacle of the free world  New York City  Trying to drive in  On one highway  That's wonderful  Horrible  Why?  Why live on Long Island?  Just the traffic  It's enraging how bad it is  It is  It's more bang for the buck  When you buy a home  Really, that's basically it  Because, Jimmy  Some people  Appreciate the suburbs  They appreciate  Going to a home  With a backyard  Perhaps a picket fence  Dude, no 
[03:25:30]  If I could  Maybe a two-car garage  I actually don't disagree with you  But I would live in Jersey  It's just a little easier  If I could afford a hovel  In New York City  A hovel  I'd live there  Before Jersey  Now, Jersey's great, man  Stop it  Look, I love all our fans in Jersey  But your state stinks  No, I like Jersey  Oh, you were born there  What's wrong with Jersey?  Nothing, it's fine  I don't like Jersey  Why?  I just don't want to say  I live in Jersey  What about north of  The George Washington Bridge?  That's a real nice area  That's very nice up there  But 
[03:26:00]  Jersey's nicer than Long Island  Then you're fighting  The same battle as Manhattan  Train, take a train  I don't want to take a train  I drive on a daily basis  Think about all the material  You'll get  Listening to the common man  Going to work every day  Yeah, Anthony  The last thing I ever want to do  Is ride a train  To work  No, I'm not a train guy  I like driving  That way I can leave when I want  You're not at the mercy  Of a train schedule  You can stop off  And get some eggs  Bread  Maybe some milk  On the way home  Hope did it for years 
[03:26:30]  You could pull up  In your own vehicle  In your nice little house  Like I said  With the picket fence  With the gal  Your best gal  Waiting at the door  When you pull your vehicle up  In the driveway  Hi, honey  Hello, dear  How was work?  Just fine  And when you get home  You sit in your comfy  Easy chair  Turn on the television  And light up  A Lucky Strike cigarette  Knowing  That within a blast radius 
[03:27:00]  Of a small atomic bomb  There isn't a negro  To be found  In your neighborhood  Jesus  That's how I like it  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  I enjoy the suburbs  In this great land of ours  Thank you  Maybe I don't want to live  In an apartment building  Jimmy  An apartment building  Where you could be all nice  And keep a nice place  And then if someone  That lives above you  Or below you 
[03:27:30]  Or next to you  Is a slob  Some of his  What they call  Cockroaches  Come underneath the woodwork  I imagine some buildings  Would have roaches  Not the one I'm living in  You're sure about that?  I talk to the man  What if there's a dirty animal  That lives there?  Can't happen  No?  Impossible  All right  I'll give you that one  Okay  How about noise?  You can tell by the t-shirt  He got out there  On the circuit  That's right  Comedy store  Hollywood shirt  What about noise?  Jim's moving on up  How about people above you?  Walking 
[03:28:00]  Oh I hate that  It's annoying  People with their  TVs up too loud  For me I like living  In New York though  I mean I've been  Suburbished my whole life though  You do business  In the city a lot though  Dude my whole life  Is here  He works here  Right  He'd have to come in  On a daily basis  At night  I would have bought  In Hoboken  For less money  But I mean  To commute in again  To come back  And do spots at night  It just would have been  A nightmare  It would have been too much  Yeah  If my driving  Was during rush hour  I'm sure I'd go insane  Yeah  And I'd have to move  Probably into Manhattan  And I just think Jersey  I only said Jersey 
[03:28:30]  Just for the traffic  You can hit bad traffic  At the Lincoln  But it's just less  Low Island  I've done the LIE  It is a mess  To me  It's the worst traffic  In the country  So you figure it's what  45 minutes  45 minutes an hour  From where I am  To get into the city  When there's no traffic  3 hours man  It burns me  It's 20 minutes  From my house  And you know what  20 minutes  From where I live  And it has taken me  Over 2 hours  To drive  What takes 20 minutes  You know what causes  Most of that shit though  It's the assholes 
[03:29:00]  At the light  That wait for  That wait like  15 seconds  Before they take off  When the light turns green  Or the one guy  That goes through  Yeah the one guy  That goes through  And there's the second guy  You see a gap of like  You know 10 cars  Could have gone  When you're in a left turn lane  And the arrow comes up  And you're back  A few cars  And you're waiting  Waiting  Waiting  And finally you see  That first car  Slowly go around  And he's all happy  He made it  And he's going to make sure  That 5 or 8 or 10 people  Behind him didn't make it  Oh you just want 
[03:29:30]  Road rage  I love the road rage  As soon as that light  Plinks green  My wrist is on the whole  Immediately  Plink  You have to  You have to  Get him moving  Because I practice  What I preach  When the light turns  I go  I have a  And also pedestrians  Here in Manhattan  Just pissed me off  Practice what I preach  Pedestrians are the worst  Here in Manhattan  They take up lanes  Where you're supposed  To be driving  When the little  Don't walk thing 
[03:30:00]  Used to actually be words  When people spoke  English in this city  But now it's just  Hieroglyphics  There's a walking guy  There's a hand  That says stop  And when the hand  Says stop  The people will stand  In the lane  That you're actually  Trying to pass  So the vehicle's in  Waiting for it to go  They're standing  In the road  That's why when  Pedestrians get run over  I'm not really too concerned  I don't care  Because I know  They weren't up  On the sidewalk  That's hilarious  Back when they spoke English  Back when there was  No immigrants  In New York  Back in the old days  When you could walk 
[03:30:30]  Through this vast city  Of ours  Speaking English  And lighting  Lucky strike cigarettes  Not with greasy  Puerto Ricans  Walking around  It used to be  A wonderful place  In 1650  And now I found  This little feature  Of the Escalade  Oh man  That is wonderful  The little boxing glove  That comes out 
[03:31:00]  And wipes  It's almost as good  As the little rascals  Boxing glove  It's a little feature  Of the Escalade  When you drive by  And somebody's standing  In your way  In one of those lanes  And you beep  So they step back  And they give you that look  I go  I'm driving over here  They step back a little  And I hit my windshield washer  Now it's on my windshield  Wiper blade  The washer  So when it swings out  A wave of washer fluid  Splashes all over anybody  That's even near  The right side of my vehicle 
[03:31:30]  And I just  Get them all wet  I just hock up  A good loogie  No this is good  You don't have to  Roll a window down  You could keep going  It's completely automatic  You could feign confusion  Like  Yeah I don't know  I'm washing my window  I'm washing my window  It just happens to be  At the same time  I'm yelling  Motherfucker  And jetting my middle finger at you  Occasionally I'll do it  For no reason whatsoever  I was going to say  Just because  Somebody's standing there  Yeah he just does it for fun  And when they get splashed  They look up  And they kind of look around  And I laugh and laugh my ass off 
[03:32:00]  What kind of a truck is it?

[03:42:30]  Because people can buy XM units  Right  Yeah  And we're 70% of the satellite radio market  And you can't find Sirius units  But for some reason  That translates into  Us being clobbered by Sirius  Anyway everyone's gearing up for me  Going over to satellite  And they're getting clobbered XM  You know  They're getting clobbered  In fact I said to  I was over at Sirius  The other day  I said I want to give away some free radios  They go  We don't have it  We can't even keep them in stock  Beyond AM 
[03:43:00]  Beyond FM is XM satellite radio  I don't want to add to the confusion  We can't even keep them in stock  We can't even keep them in stock  Stop it  That's like a standard manager answer  Yeah  You know  If someone comes  Where are these products?  We can't even keep them in stock  The shelves can't support the units  They're so heavy  That's why  That's it  Can I state what I learned?  Oh yeah  That old  That that old bag  Does not know how to give a blowjob  No  I was wrong 
[03:43:30]  And you do  And you do  I don't even fight back anymore  I learned that Bill Burr's CD is available  Oh yes  Let's get it  On eatabullet.com  Oh no  You go to the merchandise section  And Bill's new CD is called  Trinkets I Own Made From Gorilla Hands  And you can get it there  I'm such a big fan of Jim Norton  That his picture is on the cover of my CD  Bill Burr you got five seconds  What do you want to promote?
