<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Adam Ferrara as a studio guest.  The hosts relentlessly teased Ferrara about his career setbacks, including his recent cancellation from a David Letterman appearance, his past acting roles (like his stint on a "new Love Boat"), and his band "As Is." The conversation quickly descended into crude humor, encompassing sex acts, bodily functions, and detailed discussions of strip clubs, including specific Long Island establishments like the Carousel, Stonehenge, and Tender Trap.  Numerous callers contributed their own strip club anecdotes, detailing bizarre stripper talents (beer-opening, ping-pong ball tricks) and humorous encounters with various clientele, particularly construction workers frequenting daytime shows. One caller recounted getting ejected from a strip club after a particularly wild night. Another caller shared a story about unexpectedly encountering Ferrara changing a tire, apparently for method acting.  The conversation then shifted to awkward high school memories, focusing on gym class showers and humiliating encounters with gym teachers.  Callers shared stories of brutal gym teachers (one allegedly hitting a student with a lead pipe) and violent children’s games like “asses up” handball, highlighting the preferential treatment afforded to athletes.  The awkwardness of junior high square dancing was also discussed.

The show then featured a call from Andrew Dice Clay. Initially, Dice seemed to reflect seriously on how a past appearance on the show had revitalized his career, but the conversation quickly became characteristically vulgar and comedic.  Dice discussed his divorce, anxiety, intense workout routine, and stand-up act, peppering his commentary with sexually explicit jokes, profanity, and offensive jokes about midgets. He also delivered celebrity impressions of Christopher Walken and John Travolta. Several other callers contributed short anecdotes during and between segments of Dice's call.  During Dice's call, Jim Brewer was also in studio with Ferrara. Dice Clay continued his sexually explicit and offensive commentary, discussing his views on marriage and infidelity, his upcoming album, and his struggles with technology.  The conversation included homophobic slurs and other offensive language, shifting to a listener's complaint about her boss and Jim Brewer recounting humiliating experiences at TGI Fridays and other jobs.

The broadcast then featured a listener named Spaz proposing a pornographic film, with Spaz, along with a friend "Gary," pitching the idea to Opie and Anthony and suggesting they direct a scene.  The film would be shot in New York City in a Gonzo style (although Spaz showed a misunderstanding of the term), potentially including sexual positions discussed on the show ("rusty trombone," "wheelbarrow") and even Old Dirty Bastard.  The possibility of a "snuff film" element was briefly raised. Callers responded, some expressing interest in the casting call, others mocking Spaz. A tangent arose regarding Spaz's plan to temporarily shut down a competing radio station's power grid, to which Opie and Anthony expressed disbelief and concern.  A woman called claiming interest in the porn, and further calls followed. Opie and Anthony remained extremely skeptical and reluctant towards Spaz's porn proposal. The segment concluded with continued ridicule of Spaz's ideas and a short, unrelated, bizarre phone conversation. The show concluded with the hosts' usual banter and promotion of future segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  I know what you're saying.  I'm going to hang up this phone,  and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible.  There is. 
[00:00:30]  There is.  It's the opening of the internet.  At my signal.  Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit, the big man.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to stop.  Is that mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings?  If we can't talk about booing our pleasure.  Suck it up. Walk it off, Dick.  I love camel toe.  They're shaving for America.  No ass. 
[00:01:00]  I gotta see that ass.  No!  No!  I would definitely be willing to have a sexual deal with people who already had AIDS.  No ass.  Hope he says, it isn't bad.  Bad.  Rude, disgusting, self-centered pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah, blah, blah.  Thank God we get back to the angel.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:01:30]  Insert joke here.  The handy's great in a pinch.  Did I just hear that?  Hello.  Pull your pants down.  Ew.  You got bad eyes.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Number three.  Paul Duncan, too, sir.  You're all burning in hell, damn you.  Alcohol is this great radio.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you not entertained?  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea. 
[00:02:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, yes.  And in the studio this afternoon, Adam Farrar, everyone.  Hello.  Yeah, Adam's it, man.  Hi, boy.  Out of nowhere, he decided to stop by and say hi to his pals.  Yes.  I bet Hillary doesn't get bumped from Letterman.  I bet you my girlfriend doesn't get oral favors from a page. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, huh?  Wow.  So, yeah, Adam was supposed to do Letterman last time he was on the show.  What, last week?  Man.  You know what I like?  Every time I come in here, it's, hi, we're going to break your balls for a little bit.  First, it's you dated my sister.  Then it's the Olive Garden commercial.  Then I think you nailed me on the Love Boat episode I did.  I missed that damn thing.  You better have a tape of that.  I want to buy all the tapes of that.  Are you kidding me?  Because I got to see that.  You were on the, Adam was on an episode of the new Love Boat.  The new Love Boat.  Oh, don't start.  You want me to sing some of the early songs you wrote? 
[00:03:00]  Thank you, no.  Okay.  Boy, we got a lot of crap on you.  Oh, Tara.  I didn't write that.  That was Joe Buck's song.  Oh, Joe Buck wrote that?  Yeah, my brother wrote that one.  All right.  That one sucked.  Wait, how did that?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's too much going on here.  What?  This is funny for two people.  Me and Anthony.  Yeah, right?  Not really.  He sung a song called Dara, but Joe wrote it.  Now, there's a lot.  The early collections of As Is, spelled A-Z-I-Z, which is the name of like 90% of the cab drivers 
[00:03:30]  in it.  All right.  Yeah.  That was the name of one of your bands there?  As Is.  Do you think I named it?  Okay.  Look, I showed up drunk to sing.  That was the extent of it.  Oh, now you're Jim Morrison.  I didn't move equipment.  Yeah, that's great.  I didn't write the song.  Now you're Jim Morrison.  But before, when you were going, my voice.  He's walking around with an ascot and an atomizer.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Don't come back.  I must keep everybody away.  Why?  Because we're doing...  What was that song you used to do with a boss?  Lido.  And I can't hit the Lido. 
[00:04:00]  The Lido shuffle.  The Lido shuffle.  Get out of here.  You don't miss the boat.  It's breaking up.  I need more mist in my throat.  Can we transpose this to my key?  I've seen Ant work it, man.  After a gig.  It's hilarious.  Jesus.  The rest of his band is like shuffling the equipment back to the van.  And there's Ant drinking his Budweiser at the bar going, hey, man.  Tell me more about my eyes.  Come on.  What do you expect?  And that was a while ago.  That was fun, though.  I like them because I used to run the lights. 
[00:04:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And Anthony, like, would build...  You know, he's a mad scientist, for God's sake.  You know, you leave something at his house, he MacGyvers it into a helicopter.  It was toothpicks and a rubber band.  Not anymore.  It's the Spruce Goose, too.  So, he used to hook up the light board with, like, you had, like, these big rubber Lulco gloves.  Yeah.  The 220 off the pole.  Yeah.  You had to actually open up the circuit breaker box in the club and clamp on these big, um,  looked like jumper cable clamps.  They were jumper cables.  Onto the 220 bolts, onto the 2110 legs coming out of the box. 
[00:05:00]  Okay.  So, and they're live.  You can't shut it off because the club is running.  Yeah.  So, you'd have to sit there with big rubber gloves on it.  Psst, psst.  Oh.  And it was like, ghostbusters, don't cross the streams.  I know.  Because if those things touched, he could electrocute himself.  Oh, wow.  So, he would take the 220 lines and he would channel it through all this stuff into an old  Atari board.  Remember Atari board with the four switches?  And that's what...  We had four channels of lights and that's how we would move the lights.  That was when the original light board broke, my friend, and I had to rig it. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, the one you built.  That shot project.  No, the one I stole.  Oh, the one you stole.  Yeah.  Some stupid lighting company in Jersey rented us lights.  We never brought them back.  You know what?  A terrorist tried to get their deposit back on the van.  He doesn't bring back a light.  I don't remember that.  Wow.  Too funny.  Well, that was many, many years ago, Adam.  Many, many years ago.  And, of course, we do dredge up these things and things that you did in the past.  Because, I don't know why.  It's not interesting at all, is it? 
[00:06:00]  No.  It's amusing to us.  But we were saying you got bumped from Letterman.  That's where it started.  And it was last week.  And there's a lot of people on the phone that feel bad for you.  Thank you.  Kathleen?  Yeah.  I wanted to know, how many times have you been bumped from Letterman?  What's the process like?  And does it really piss you off?  This is my first time being bumped.  It hurts.  And I'm getting over the pain.  Thank you, Kevin.  Adam walked through our studio door today.  I said, hey, if you were on Letterman last week, I don't think we would have saw your face for a while.  Yeah.  I know.  He'd have been elsewhere.  I told you I was coming back here today to plug my governor's date. 
[00:06:30]  He'd have been elsewhere.  I'm a whore.  That's why.  You better call ahead.  I'm following the seal.  Adam does very well.  Look at you.  You sound like my mother's friend.  He's in show business doing very well.  Very well.  He's doing very well.  I understand he has gentle through the union.  How's mom and Big Joe?  Mom and my father.  Yeah.  I told you they came into Letterman.  It was a big night.  She wore the fur.  Yeah.  I feel so bad.  His parents go to Letterman.  They're sitting right there up front to see their son on national TV. 
[00:07:00]  David Letterman.  Pop took a nap in the afternoon so it'd be all right.  So he could stay away.  Sure.  And what happens?  He gets bumped.  And, you know, your parents had to get up and leave without seeing you hit the big stage there.  No, my father's like, hey, it happens.  That's life.  You want Chinese?  That was it.  That was it, huh?  That was it.  We got some steamed dumplings and you move on.  You think, yeah, tonight you think Dave's going to have, you know, the 45 minutes of crap,  stupid bits where he takes a camera to the film store next door from the studio while Hillary 
[00:07:30]  waits in the green room wondering if she's going to be on?  I don't think so.  And who's more entertaining?  Hillary or Adam Ferrara?  Adam Ferrara.  Adam Ferrara.  Absolutely.  Never saw Hillary say Hospitaliano.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  I knew there had to be a bite away in there somewhere, Alice.  All right.  What's bite away?  Aha!  Adam, I remember a time I went to see you at Governor's.  And I'm thinking Anthony's friend, big Hollywood star. 
[00:08:00]  You were doing the sitcoms and the guest appearances and stuff.  I brought Sandy, right?  We're walking across the parking lot.  There you are before your big night at Governor's changing a tire.  Oh, changing a flat tire.  Oh, yeah.  And you know what's funny?  My travel plans now is my father's plumbing truck because mom's got to take the caddy to  Marjorn.  I'm not actually changing a tire.  I'm getting into my next role on Caroline in the City where I have to change a tire. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I'm researching it.  We all consider ourselves to be in show business.  And we look up to you, Adam, and I'm like, wow, you really should raise your goals.  I'm like, look at Adam changing a tire.  I'm like, where's his people?  I'm like, people.  You're the only, like, pal I have that's in show business.  Yeah.  Like that.  What are you, in real estate?  What the hell do you think you're doing?  Well, I'm not my own pal.  What?  I'm not my own pal.  I've heard you talk to yourself many times.  Usually after a gig, who does Joe Buck think he is?  I'm the leader of this band.  Yeah.  As is, behind the music. 
[00:09:00]  That happens.  As is.  A-Z-I-Z.  A-Z-I-Z.  That was so long ago.  That was a fancy logo and stuff on the drum kit.  That was so long ago.  It was ridiculously long ago.  But you've got to share a little bit.  To the point where.  No, it was.  That wasn't even the first.  What was the first name of the band?  I couldn't even remember.  Did you guys have the hair going and stuff?  Like the silver platters.  Oh, dude, it was ridiculous.  It was, yeah, 80s.  So you wanted to try to.  Flying down the highway in a makeshift model.  Yeah, we were doing Grady Bunch cover tunes is what we were doing, Adam.  You're absolutely right.  It's a sunshine day when it's time to change. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, that's exactly what we were doing.  Although we did do some Spinal Tap covers.  I do remember that.  That was fun.  Anna.  Yeah, hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you boys doing?  Good.  One time I seen Adam at Governor's.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's pretty hot.  Yes, he is, isn't he?  I want to grab onto his buns.  Adam, she wants to grab your buns.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say, so, you know. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.  Hey, whose sister are you?  Whose sister?  Hey, I got seven of them.  Which one do you want?  Adam has something for all the sisters on this radio show.  Wow.  Now, so you met him, what, backstage?  Well, he was, like, kind of back then.  I was walking past him, and I walked up to him, and, you know, I asked him, what's pink  and smells like pussycats?  And he's like, what?  And I stuck my tongue out at him.  And then I told him, I'm like, what?  Anna, oh, I remember you. 
[00:10:30]  You remember that?  Interesting.  You can't remember that.  Anna, that doesn't happen every day.  And then I was telling you about, I guess, I could say Tuesday night at Hummer Club.  I do that, and I let my friend watch as I'm doing it, too.  You know, my old man.  Boy, it sure sounded like you could have gotten lucky.  That's when you fell on your butt.  You're like, oh, my God.  So if Adam would have been up to it, would you have given him a Hummer that night?  It wasn't until it was Thursday.  Sure.  My old man was home, sure.  It was the wrong day of the week.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:00]  It doesn't matter.  It could be any day of the week.  I'm always up for that.  You should see Adam when he gets done with his show.  He comes out to the bar in the front by governors and stuff.  All right, I got to go.  And the chicks are just, like, digging them and stuff.  All right.  Well, I know he's got to be nice.  Isn't he married?  What's that?  I got a girlfriend.  No, he's got a girlfriend, though.  Oh, he's better.  He's in a very serious relationship.  How is she?  She's very nice.  Yeah?  Very good.  Yeah, she's trying a nice one.  Can I meet her?  Can I meet her?  Oh, meet.  Yeah, can I meet her? 
[00:11:30]  I thought you said something.  I'll take both of you's on, honey.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow.  Do you remember what she looked like and all?  No.  No, huh?  I just...  What do you look like there, Anna?  Let's see.  Well, I'm a dancer.  Really?  Yeah.  Where?  Like, why?  Flash dancers?  Stonehenge.  Stonehenge.  Stonehenge.  Out on Long Island?  Yeah, with Babylon.  Oh, I remember that place.  That place rocked.  I love that place.  I have the best time.  So you're a dancer there, huh?  Buy me a Rumpelman. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, boy.  Now, wait a minute.  Do you dance during the week or do you dance on the weekends?  During the day.  I don't like going at night.  Uh-oh, day dancing.  You're a matinee.  That's scary.  Day dancing at Stonehenge.  That's scary.  You know why they usually put the girls that aren't that hot on in the day?  Hey, it's kind of...  No, I'm just saying because when you walk in there from all the bright light into the dark club,  it takes you a half hour before you can see anything.  Yeah, I know.  And then by that time, you've had a couple of $10 beers.  I don't like going at night because I've got better things to do at night.  And it looks like you're in the double-A ball. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What's a double-A ball?  You've got to be brought up to the majors.  Yeah, it's like open pole mic.  Yeah.  Wow, Stonehenge.  No, but you look hot and stuff.  I'm cool, man.  You're not all bruised up and everything.  I'm all bruised up.  There's nothing better than looking at a dancer that looks like she's gone a couple of rounds  with Tyson.  A Cazarian scar.  Yeah.  She's all beat up.  An old cigarette burns.  No, I don't like that.  You're not skanked up then. 
[00:13:00]  No, like a redhead.  Like a subway car.  You're like a subway car.  There's a lot going on.  I'm good.  Do you have a D-cup?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's the other one?  There was five people talking to one time I heard that.  But she said she has a D-cup.  What's the other one?  That's in the middle of her head.  No, it's in the back of my head.  I'm deaf, you know.  The bells.  What color hair do you have?  It's red.  Oh, you're a redhead.  Yeah.  Natural?  Well, I got no hair on my... 
[00:13:30]  Really?  Yeah.  You know, I like a girl that edits herself.  There you go.  Do you shave it or did it fall out?  You know, ever since Shoram reactivated...  Was it rubbed off?  With your face, honey.  Wow.  There you go.  She's not messing around.  No, definitely not.  She's hurt at all.  During the day dancing.  Yeah, the day dancing.  They don't even give them dollars.  The guys, like, give them mints and baseball cards.  Well, you know what the clientele the day dancers get?  It's all...  Because I remember they're doing this. 
[00:14:00]  It's all construction workers that don't want to friggin' work.  Right.  So they go in there during the day.  You figure, oh, we'll leave the job.  We'll have an early lunch and we'll get back to work, you know, right after lunch.  We'll be back to work by one.  Mm-hmm.  You go there at noon.  It opens up.  By four o'clock, you're going, gee, screw it.  We'll leave the tools out.  We've got to be there tomorrow anyway.  You never go back.  You just watch that.  Give us some ten-penny nails for a lap dance.  And that's it, too.  You're broke.  Yeah.  Because you're never working. 
[00:14:30]  So you just sit there with a dollar and nurse your beer.  How many pelts for a lap dance?  Pretty much.  I'll put in air conditioning in your house.  Spin around.  Spin around.  Let me see your raise.  Oh, we're off to a fine start today.  And we've got to take a quick break.  Oh, look at the time.  We're very late.  But Adam Farrar hanging out with us today.  Cool.  Yes.  We needed the boost this week, Adam.  So thanks for coming in.  Sure.  Absolutely.  All right.  More of your phone calls in just a bit.  Stay there.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus. 
[00:15:00]  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony and our buddy Adam Farrar.  It's 1027 WNEW.  Hey, you guys struck a nerve because there's a bunch of people that want to talk about  daytime strippers.  Yeah.  And going to the strip clubs during the day, Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  I love walking out of the strip club after you've been in there and it's still light out.  You're like Frankenstein.  You can't see.  Cars are beeping at you.  I remember coming out of it.  They finally changed where the door is at the carousel on Jericho Turnpike there.  Oh, I remember that place.  The door was right, like, 10 feet away from Jericho Turnpike.  So you'd walk out and, you know, housewives are looking at you in horror.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  They're all beeping at you like, yeah, yeah, I was looking at the strippers.  Now they put the door kind of on the side.  That's smart.  They made a little thing.  But you'd come out and the sun hits your eyes.  It's like Shawshank Redemption.  You know?  You're like, oh, my God, the light.  I'm free.  It's Papillon.  You were in the box.  It's Papillon.  Yeah.  It's in the box.  Put him in the hole for another month.  It's like when you come out of the carousel now, they have, like, a car wash thing to  cleanse you.  Clean you off.  You just feel dirty.  That's it.  Send you home.  Hey, Frank, what's up? 
[00:16:30]  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Great.  Great place where I went to college down in San Antonio, Texas, called Class Act.  And it was far from it.  Anything but.  Yeah.  It was BYOB.  That's how bad this place was.  They couldn't get a liquor light.  What's that?  Bring your own bimbos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the great thing is they had a lunch buffet.  Yeah.  I never got that.  I don't like eating food from strip clubs.  I like to keep them separate.  It's bad enough you've got to put your mouth on a bottle that's on the bar that sometimes  they're walking on.  Now, I haven't seen this move in a while. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  In the Long Island strip clubs.  But I remember back late 80s and stuff was the last of this.  The dancers didn't care.  They'd come right out on the bar, you know, open your bottle for you without their hands.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, like, like, it's like, wow, talented snack.  The thing about this place is the funniest thing to watch is we went after finals every  semester.  It was a tradition.  And we'd all get out of finals about noon and go get snotted and watch girls.  And the funniest thing to watch was see the guys go through the buffet line, you know, 
[00:17:30]  go eat stage side.  And as the girls would work their way around, watch the guys cover their plates.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was like their hands are covering the plate.  Like, that's a barrier.  Yeah.  You know, that's going to do it.  That'll do it.  Believe me.  What's coming off of that thing?  She just opened a beer bottle.  She has a Swiss Army snatch.  I swear to God, I've seen that move, too.  And even with the beer, like a girl come walking by and the guy will take the coaster and plop 
[00:18:00]  it on top of his beer glass.  That's got to make the girl feel good.  Excuse me.  I'm thinking something is falling out of there that even alcohol can't kill.  Okay.  I really I'm going to cover this up right about now.  We were seniors spring semester.  We even got a little bit too rowdy for this place.  We're really drunk, and one of my drunkest buddies stands up and screams, and I won't  I'll clean this up, screams, bring on the sea.  Bring on the sea word.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's great. 
[00:18:30]  Last time I heard that was on Broadway when they wanted to bring a. . .  That was in the Will Rogers folly.  But the guy spilled it out with a rope.  Still is Stevens on stage.  Bring on the sea word.  Oh, my God.  That's the same guy that goes home in the car.  Why don't the chicks dig me?  What do I got to do?  So what did they do to the guy?  Where's the love?  It was like out of a Western, you know, when the star of the movie gets called out in the  street for a gunfight.  Yeah.  It was like quiet.  And all of a sudden, the DJ gets on the mic and goes, we have nice girls here. 
[00:19:00]  How dare you talk about them like that?  And then they kicked us out in the street.  Oh, yeah.  You're lucky they kicked you out.  A lot of the bars, you know, the biker guys that run the place will beat the crap out  of you.  Very funny, Frank.  All right, you guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  I knew a girl, you know, the ping pong ball trick, right?  Yeah, sure.  She had like laser sighting.  Really?  She was like, she's the kind of girl you want to take to the carnival to win the fish.  You know what I had?  Right?  You know, give me two fish if I don't use my hand. 
[00:19:30]  A guppy.  You know, just every time.  A dead ringer.  But in like those tall glasses, those tall bar glasses where there's not a lot of room  And she could get them in there.  Yeah.  That's a talent.  Sure.  I don't even know how she was aiming.  You got to adjust like the windage and the elevation.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Yeah, we're pulling the nooner.  That's what we call them.  We left at noon and we figured we'd be back by one.  And now I'm heading back right now.  We just got out of the bar.  See?  And what do you do for a living?  I'm a plumber in Jersey.  I have been there.  I have been there. 
[00:20:00]  When we worked in Smithtown, we used to go to that place right by the brass rail, brass monkey.  No, it was that other place.  I think it was called Logan's Run after the wild toads or frogs or something.  And then the other place.  Mr. Toad's Wild Run.  Mr. Toad's Wild Run.  Yes, it was.  And then Ron Conkoma had a place called Birds.  Birds Place.  I mean, the girls, you hear this all the time, but would do anything.  Really?  They had a guy up there with glasses on, laying on his back on the stage. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  And believe me, when the girl was done with him, he had to clean his glasses off.  Really?  It was that much of a show going on on stage.  He thought he had cataracts.  Yeah, it was that bad.  I'm going to make a mistake.  I saw a stripper with one foot.  I swear to God.  She had like one foot, a normal foot, and then another foot had like little chiclet toes.  Oh, a club foot kind of thing?  But you want to know what foot did that?  That's what you need, a thalidomide stripper.  Wait, she had her breasts done.  You'd think you'd take care of all the other stuff first. 
[00:21:00]  Please.  The general rule of construction is you don't put a second floor in a house with a bad foundation.  And all the construction guys got to know that.  That's it, man.  Hey, you were a tin knocker, right?  Hell yeah.  That's it, man.  That's who we were drinking with.  We were with the tin knockers.  Everybody decided to take a nooner.  But since I'm the low man on the totem pole, we left the bar and everybody patting me on  the back and said, now go put the tools away.  Yeah, go put the tools away.  Wow.  Dude, you don't know how many hammer drills and sawzalls were lost because we just never 
[00:21:30]  went back to the job site.  It's like, oh, did we lock up the tools?  And no one's going to steal them.  What happened to the hammer drill?  I don't know, boss.  We were there the whole time.  I think the plumbers took it.  They're not.  We're drunk.  Those bastards steam finners.  Hey, Joe, thank you.  Hey, guys, you got a train.  Have a good day.  All right, man.  Barbara.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you, Barbara?  What's up, guys?  All right.  I live around the blocks in the Stonehenge.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen some of the girls at work at night.  I can't even imagine what the day crew looks like. 
[00:22:00]  And the place that.  What?  Don't let the sunlight hit them.  Please look at the main stage.  Let's start.  And the place that Anthony was talking about before used to be the Bull Creek.  Oh, the Bull Creek.  That was it.  Yeah, that's what he was talking about.  Now, how are you privy to such information?  Yeah, how do you know all this?  Miss, I needed to get through college.  I live on Long Island.  I live on Long Island.  It's not that big.  Yeah, every Long Island that knows all that.  Remember the Brass Monkey?  That's the one I'm thinking of.  Yeah, I went to the Brass Monkey.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you were there that time.  And your brother. 
[00:22:30]  And someone threw a shot glass at us.  Yeah.  And I think it was one of the girls.  Flying it right out of there.  It was amazing.  It was the girl with the hair lip.  Projectile.  Remember her?  She ran out of ping pong balls that night.  Yeah.  We were goofing on her hair lip and she threw a shot glass at us.  Did she have two feet?  Yeah, she did.  How about that?  Carousel, I remember when I was a kid.  Yeah.  It's still there.  Yeah, sure.  It was right by the wagon wheel on the corner.  Then there was a place at the corner of Larkfield and Jericho Turnpike called the Voyage Inn.  I mean, this was going back before I could ever even dream of it. 
[00:23:00]  I just remember exotic West Coast dancers.  It's like, oh, what is that?  And my father would be like, you know, all right, wait in the car.  I got to talk.  I got to talk to someone in here.  And he'd go in there and, like, I'd be waiting there for hours just sitting in the car.  Really?  I swear.  And he'd come out, you know, all tanked and stuff.  The guy never made it.  Never met me.  Pull off.  It's like, and he was in there watching nudes and stuff.  Wow.  Yeah.  Thanks, Pop.  I was on the road. 
[00:23:30]  Roll the window down a crack, could you?  I'm getting a contact high.  I was in, what was it?  Oh, Green Bay, Wisconsin.  There's a strip club called Bean Snappers.  Bean Snappers?  I swear to God, you get in the car, you drive through the darkness.  Because it's like, there's no lights or nothing.  It's like, this is the place.  Oh, I thought you meant it was a bad neighborhood.  No.  I thought maybe Adam was starting to get really politically incorrect.  Where's the racist bell?  Jesus.  So you drive through the darkness and you go to this, in the middle of nowhere.  This is like where, like, the flying saucers land. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  You know, they go, sure.  They come down and looked at my ass.  So it's an empty barn.  It's a barn.  There's like linoleum on the floor.  There's a guy's, no booze, because you can't have naked girls in booze, but you've got  to spend like four bucks for cranberry juice.  Oh, juice bar.  It's a juice bar with naked girls, but you know the girls that drink, can I have the  cranberry juice?  Why?  Bladder infection.  I'm up next.  You know, they've got to do it.  Just the scariest.  I have an inflamed urethra.  I could use the cranberry juice.  We have so many stories on the line. 
[00:24:30]  Where do we want to go?  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on WNW.  What's up?  Joe, guys, one of my favorite topics of all time.  I love the T-bars, as we call them.  Oh, yeah.  Patterson, New Jersey has some of the skankiest, let me tell you.  There's three in a row on Market Street.  They go from, you know, young Brazilian Russian girls and everything to like grandmothers.  This one joint, Moonlight.  Oh, and you can do, with your clothes on, you can do almost anything in the three of them, 
[00:25:00]  I'm telling you.  Oh, really?  You can basically buy a chick a drink and you're married to her for that night.  It's incredible.  It's just, it's not like nothing you've ever seen.  You ever get out to New Jersey, go to Patterson, Market Street, ask anybody, they'll know who  I'm talking about, you know?  Well, I like the skanky bars sometimes because they really appreciate the buck.  Absolutely.  You know, when you go to the high-class strip clubs and you get the girls that really look  hot, you're not going to get anything for a buck.  You slip them a five and they give you one quick little look.  And then you need at least a 20 for a lap dance. 
[00:25:30]  It's funny you say that because the hotter the chick, like the less she'll let you do,  you know?  It's like you go to the grandmother joint and there's no rules.  Oh, you go to a skank club.  Let me tell you, skank club, the tender trap, Jericho Turnpike.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Right next to the radiator place.  Let me tell you something.  They got penicillin dispensers on the wall.  Oh, yeah.  You go in there for like a buck, you could get anything you want.  The girls appreciate that.  They look like war pigs. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  But for the love of God, for a buck, oh, they're appreciative.  Sure.  And they have the...  They'll shake that flat, flabby ass right in your face.  It's Borneo.  They had the lost art in there, too, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  The rug act.  The rug dance rug act.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Remember that?  You rarely see the rug act anymore.  Remember that?  The girl would come out and she...  And I dare you.  Take a little blanket.  She had that little quilt from when she was in ninth grade.  That grandma quilted, probably. 
[00:26:30]  Put it on the floor.  Hit the jukebox.  This little...  We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  Let's make it less.  Flip.  And she's just like...  Just like writhing on the floor.  She's like a praying mantis.  Yeah, it's the rug act.  With her hand lotion.  Yeah, lotion.  And then she's pointing it right at you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She's got her legs right at you.  It's like chicken.  Who's going to flinch first?  And she's up.  I made you blink. 
[00:27:00]  Made my eyes to you.  What do you mean you made me blink?  The legs are going up and apart.  Yeah.  And your buddies are trying to sneak a look over your shoulder.  Yeah.  Like it's a peep show.  Yeah, come on.  Hurry up before the quarter runs out.  The rug act.  You don't see that that much anymore.  And I defy you to find a donkey show.  We've got tonight.  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  It's always that slow song.  The slow song.  My first strip club experience, the first song I ever heard in a strip club was House of the Rising Sun. 
[00:27:30]  Really?  Oh, that's what you hear.  There is a house in the world.  I like when the girl tries to dance though and then does that.  Could you eject this song?  I'm not feeling it.  Eject.  And she feels like she has to cover up at that moment.  Now I'm naked.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Could you eject?  I'm out of character.  This has got to start over.  Yeah.  And it makes you feel like she likes you so much.  She comes over and gives you the eyes.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  She puts her breasts down towards you, grabs your dollar with her cleavage, gives you a little smile, a little wink, a little look, stands up, turns away, takes the buck and throws it in a pile with the other. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, I'm just a mark.  Oh, my God.  I thought she liked me this time.  I like the bachelor party.  I thought we were going to do it.  I thought we were going to go out after she got off work.  What are you doing looking at my girl?  Right.  I like the bachelor party because the bachelor's always like Kennedy drunk.  He's like smashed.  Really?  You know?  Yeah.  And his friends are always like, come on, man, look at the way that dance is looking at you. 
[00:28:30]  She likes you for you.  You got to go.  It's not the fact we gave her $200.  Oh, yeah.  She was a person.  Out of the hundreds of bachelors, she's hobbed.  Yeah.  She really likes you.  Hob.  Hob.  What kind of herb is that?  Hob.  Too hob.  We got to speak in code on this show.  Our buddy Foot is on the line.  Foot.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, just tuned into the show.  I don't know if there's a couple of stories the guys didn't tell you about the time that we were at the tender trap.  And Anthony started goofing on this native American dancer. 
[00:29:00]  It was an Indian.  Oh, yeah.  I was calling her Squaw.  Yeah.  And Anthony starts going.  Oh.  Right on stage.  She got pissed.  She stops, man.  She starts yelling at Anthony.  You know?  I'm like, hmm.  Very sorry.  Yeah.  Me.  Me.  Heap.  Heap sorry.  Yeah.  Me piss him you off.  White man, screw me.  We open casino.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey.  Try dancing to this, Squaw.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  I remember that because you go, what are you going to do?  Make it rain?  Yeah.  She's doing a rain dance.  I don't know if Adam told this story.  When Adam was over, where the hell was he?  He went over to Billy Joel's house, knocked on the door and asked him where the carousel was.  Oh, God.  You're going, what was I?  I was like 14 years old.  Yeah.  You knocked on Billy Joel's house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was lost.  Yeah.  And I knew who lived there.  Yeah.  I knew he lived there. 
[00:30:00]  What was that, Lloyd Neck or something?  That was the one on the corner.  The one on the house in Lloyd Neck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ozzy was with me.  Yeah.  And he goes, where the hell are we?  He said, oh, I know who lives here.  Pull over.  I know who lives here.  Well, I did.  I saw it.  I knew he lived there.  He didn't know you.  What were you doing in that area?  There's nothing there.  I think we were in the fencing truck.  We were working.  Of course, because you only go during the day when you're working.  We were working during the day, and we finished the job early.  I'm like, I don't want to go back to the shop now.  Foot will put me on a forklift.  I want to go out.  So Ozzy goes, where are we going to go?  How are we going to get out of here?  He said, pull over here. 
[00:30:30]  I know the guy that lives there.  No, the guy.  Well, he goes, who lives there?  I go, you don't know him.  So I got out, and I knocked on the door, and he came out.  Billy Joel.  And I asked him.  Did he know?  Yeah, he knew.  Like, he wasn't always Billy Joel.  He had a day job.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like it's back to me.  Sometimes you want to hear...  What? 
[00:31:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All dirty in the studio.  Hello.  Natalie, what's going on?  Hi, gentlemen.  Hello.  Hi.  I got a question.  Yeah.  Why is it acceptable and not considered homophobic for, in the game of football, a quarterback  that basically has his complete arm up the guy's rear end of who's snapping it?  Well, that is pretty homo.  You're right.  But that's acceptable to you.  You'd always laugh as a kid, you know. 
[00:31:30]  That homo.  That's a little weird.  Okay.  Just wondering, like, where you draw the line.  You know, I played a lot of sports in high school.  Can never get into that patting on the ass thing, man.  Like, yo, go on, man.  I hated that.  Happened all the time.  High school wrestling.  Nice shot.  Nice shot.  Nice shot.  And they're patting you on the butt.  Get your hand on my ass.  Or the towel snap in the shower.  The towel snapping in the shower.  That just doesn't happen.  Oh, please.  That's just total game. 
[00:32:00]  That's folklore.  Folklore.  That never happened, right?  Have you ever...  Come on.  I mean, every guy that's listening to us had to take showers with all the guys in school  and stuff.  You never did.  Never had the towel snapping going on.  Never did.  Wouldn't know.  Showers in high school.  Never did.  I hated it.  Yo, they never had that in high school.  Thank you, Natalie.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Yeah, you were in high school.  It was probably like a prison rape scene in the shower.  Jesus Christ.  Lockdown.  They had showers and all that.  Lockdown high. 
[00:32:30]  I think, yo, no, no.  You know what they did?  They turned the showers into a locker room.  You never showered after gym class in school?  Yeah, me?  Yo, that's my word.  We used to stink and go to, like, social studies and be like...  Used to break cologne and all that.  Then your head got all freaked out.  Well, you are Puerto Rican.  Dominican, whatever.  You know, cologne.  What's that?  Cologne shower.  Same thing.  Oh, my God.  Yo, OP, man.  Cologne.  Cologne shower.  Same thing.  Great.  It's the Puerto Rican shower, man. 
[00:33:00]  Let me bathe real quick.  I just wouldn't take a shower in class.  I was such an introverted little kid in school, too.  I would just go to my classes, go to gym.  Not even change, you know?  I'd be the guy with the friggin' jeans on and the fur coat.  With the galani car.  And just, like, my shoes.  My hush puppies.  It was a drag for me.  Gym teacher hated me.  I developed real late, and I'm in the shower. 
[00:33:30]  I'm the only guy that doesn't have, like, freaking...  No hair cake?  Oh, God.  It's just like...  It looked like a...  It looked like a Purdue chicken.  It looked like young William Hosea.  A young man's boy.  It looked like...  It looked like you were in the shower.  Yes, dear boy.  Woo!  It looked like a Purdue chicken leg.  It just sucked.  I'm like, oh, God.  What a cool joke this is.  Gym teacher hated me.  I would just come in, and, like, my hair was in that transition between straight and 
[00:34:00]  going completely, like, badass curly, so I had no clue what to do with it, so I would  just, like, leave it.  I'd wake up.  It was all over the place.  You're a kid, you know?  And I would just put on, like, a shirt and pants, and I'm untalked and stuff.  I didn't care.  I was just, like I said, like an introverted little kid.  I'd just walk around.  And the gym teacher, this big brawny schmucko, friggin' militant asswife, said, get over 
[00:34:30]  here!  Come here!  Toes on the line!  And I'm standing there, oh, yeah, like I'm a soldier now, you know, in the army of this  friggin' nut.  Toes on the line to play with a huge, oversized ball.  Yeah, great.  So I'm standing there, and he looked at me, and he, like, he goes down the line, like  he's inspecting the troops.  He stops at me, he's like, look at the way you groom yourself, man. 
[00:35:00]  Like, what?  What?  He did, he said that.  Look at the way you groom yourself, man.  I'm just looking at him, and he's got, he's got like these huge, friggin', like, muscle  man arms, and he's just standing, and I'm like, what?  What?  You know, what do I know?  I don't know nothing.  Look at your hair, why don't you brush your hair?  Straighten yourself up, man.  Like, I'm at the rehab clinic.  I'm a dopey kid.  That's how I was.  That was it.  And the guy, like, trying to give me some kind of complex. 
[00:35:30]  It must have worked.  I still remember it.  Jesus Christ.  You didn't pay attention.  Not a bit, Opie.  When they were, you know, showing you the film, Anthony, about hygiene and all that.  Look the way Mike brushes his hair.  Anthony isn't brushing his hair.  He's Mr. Bungle.  See that lice coming off Anthony's neck?  Anthony doesn't offer Susie a seat in the cafeteria.  Mike always offers Susie a seat.  Anthony's Mr. Bungle.  Look at the way he grooms himself. 
[00:36:00]  Were you the guy that had, like, the shorts, the t-shirt, and the denim jacket on?  No, because I didn't.  Yeah, you know.  Remember those kids?  I didn't put the shorts on.  I didn't change.  I stood there.  I had my shoes on.  I never.  And I would just stand there.  And, like, that was it.  You failed gym?  I didn't care.  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  All the time.  I hated gym.  It was the dumbest thing. 
[00:36:30]  I wasn't, like, because there were the sports kids.  Like, there were five or so in every gym class that were just, like, totally into it.  They knew all the friggin' teams and everything and just, I wasn't into it.  I was more into science.  I didn't like, uh, I was like a nerd.  In our school, when you took gym, too, they made you play stupid sports.  Yeah.  Badminton.  Also, we're playing badminton.  Why are we playing badminton?  I didn't even care.  I didn't care what sport we were playing.  We could go to Westchester Country Club. 
[00:37:00]  Pretty much.  Run some laps.  Where's your uniform?  Uniform.  What is this?  The Waffen SS?  My uniform.  It's short.  Pal.  The gym teachers were the worst.  You gotta come dressed in your uniform.  I was, like, ready to just grab some kind of uniform.  All right, here you go, Boy Scout.  There, it's a uniform.  You had a guy gym teacher?  Yeah, it was a guy's gym class.  Yeah, well, we had...  You had a girl gym teacher?  We had the dyke, uh, Johnny Bulls. 
[00:37:30]  No, the girl's gym class had the dyke gym teacher.  No, we had a dyke one, too.  All right, there's a problem.  And you were showering.  They didn't come into the shower with you.  They were in the same friggin' place.  They could walk out of their little office into the locker room.  They never did.  Oh, as far as you know.  They weren't gonna say nothing on me anyway.  I could care less.  I don't know, the dyke gym teacher, I always remember as being the, uh, the girl's gym teacher.  Yeah.  And they'd shut those big separating doors with the other little door, the accordion door, and that was it. 
[00:38:00]  I remember right before it would close, you'd look at a girl and just go, oh, bye.  See ya.  Bye, girls.  See ya.  See ya.  Right away, you groom yourself, man.  Man?  I'm not a man.  I'm a very small lad.  At this point.  And on the other side of that big door, the dyke gym teacher.  Oh, there was sex parties going on.  We all know that.  The dyke teacher was trying to get a look at the young little, uh, teenage chick.  All right, we're gonna do some rope climbing today, girls. 
[00:38:30]  Up the rope.  I'm gonna hold the bottom of the rope here so, uh, it doesn't jiggle around on you while you're climbing it so much.  And, uh, we don't want to weigh you down with those cumbersome panties.  You're gonna take those off.  And, uh, shorts.  So it's gonna be naked rope climbing that I will hold the rope at the bottom.  Yo, now thinking about it, yo, that freaking rope was high.  You had to go all the way up to the ceiling for that.  Yeah.  Yo, now that I think about it, that thing was high, yo.  You know what, though?  I didn't mind going to the top because that's when I finally figured out that this thing was used for something else. 
[00:39:00]  On the rope.  Oh.  Yeah, when I was young.  Dude, that is sick.  What did you do with the rope?  That's like, he was rubbing his thing against the wall.  Humping it like a poodle on company.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let me find out you were burned.  No, I was sliding down and went, oh my god, there's something else going on down there.  Yeah?  That's how I figured it out.  Oh, that's when you discovered your...  Hell yeah.  That's like in the shape of a...  Look at Rick always trying to...  Rick is always trying to turn everything into some homo thing.  Yo, it's the shape of a big schween. 
[00:39:30]  You're sliding down a long schlong.  Yeah, that's what I'm doing, Rick.  That's exactly what I think.  I wish you could see Opie's face when he totally writes off, Rick.  That's the funniest thing.  You know, Rick, that's exactly what I'm thinking when I'm banging your sister.  Oh!  That it's just like the big rope in grammar school.  That's what I'm thinking.  You think my sister's a big schlong?  It's like Rick's sister or a big rope from gym class. 
[00:40:00]  Let me think about this one for a while.  Oh, it's getting personal.  Rope would have been cheaper for me to send on a cruise.  Oh, Dirty, you were way out of the conversation today.  Did you even hear this one?  Yeah, I heard it.  Oh, okay.  Ant just found out and I was scared because, you know, I'm like,  God damn, I don't want to pay for this cruise.  And I was praying.  Pay for the cruise.  You barely give me my 20 bucks back.  Now you're borrowing for the train. 
[00:40:30]  I didn't pay for a cruise.  So I'm like sitting here going,  Oh, I pray Ant doesn't find out that he paid for my chick's cruise.  I paid for his chick to fly down to Florida.  And then jump on a boat.  Go on a cruise down in the Caribbean for a week.  Fly back to New York.  Paid for Anthony.  You had to pay two dogs.  I never even saw her naked.  Not even a picture.  I haven't either lately. 
[00:41:00]  Where am I sending her for next vacation?  Old Dirty, I'm sweating because I'm like,  Man, I don't want to pay that bill, man.  That could change.  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about it.  I thought it was all on the slide.  Like Ant would never find out.  But he finally got out.  I finally put two and two together.  It's like, wait a minute.  I was just hoping you thought it was like a really expensive cruise.  It was.  Well, yeah, for two people.  But I was hoping you got the bill and thought, wow, that was just a real expensive cruise for one person. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  Amex.  I got enough points on my American Express from that cruise to take my own cruise.  And then, you know, I paid it.  And then I'm thinking.  Over vacation, I'm thinking.  I'm assessing like finances and everything.  Yeah, after you write the check, right?  And then it's like, wait a minute.  I go online to do my banking and I look at any deposits that were in it.  There was no deposit matching that price. 
[00:42:00]  Like, I paid for Sandy's cruise.  Oh.  All right.  I'll pay you back.  You know, it's not your fault.  It's not mine either.  It wasn't my idea.  I know.  Well, she needed a shoulder to cry on.  Yeah, well, it's an expensive shoulder for God's sake.  Jiminy Cricket.  Yump and Yiminy.  Anyway.  Oh, Jesus.  There's some great phones waiting to go on the air, but we've got to take a quick break. 
[00:42:30]  If you're on hold, we're going to go to you next really fast, okay?  You've got to pay for me to go somewhere now.  Sandy's got to pay for me and you to go sunning and jet ski.  Oh, wait.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to bring the rope?  Where's Sandy going to get the money from?  You.  Yeah, exactly.  She's going to get it from Jim.  Exactly.  Jesus.  All right, so let's take a quick break.  If you're on hold, stay right there, okay?  More of the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit. 
[00:43:00]  Opie.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, that's funny.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  Opie in the studio today.  Hang with us.  Oh, yeah.  Trying to enter the show.  Still waiting for something to come out of his mouth.  Oh.  Oh, I forgot that guy. 
[00:43:30]  Wait, let's talk to...  Oh, wait.  Eva, hold on a sec.  What do you got, Ed?  Guy, Peter, from my old hometown.  Do you remember playing dodgeball at Elwood Junior High with Coach Cazazza, trying to give  innocent 14-year-old's concussions, this guy, Coach Cazazza, boy, name from the past, Coach  Cazazza, he would take you into, I don't know what it was, the deepest bowels of Elwood  Junior High into like a boiler room thing.  Wow.  Yeah, tell me about it.  With the little red dodgeball thing. 
[00:44:00]  Remember the sound it made when it hit your head?  Boom.  There you go.  Boom.  And he would just like go at it.  Like two split up the teams and you play dodgeball in this padded room in the boiler.  It was like some kind of prison experience.  And then he'd jump in every so often.  If the ball bounced off the wall and he grabbed it, boom, like wing it like a howitzer at your  head.  What a sadistic bastard.  Bam.  Dodgeball.  Very sadistic game.  Yeah.  Anyway.  In the boiler room. 
[00:44:30]  What is it?  The WWF?  It was a boiler room match.  Boiler room brawl.  If you ever turned your back accidentally in dodgeball, you couldn't turn back around.  Because you knew the second you turned around, that ball would be right in your face.  Oh!  No, it...  Boom.  There it is.  Boom.  But it had a crazy sting to it, too.  I never got a head in the ground.  Yeah.  You know the guy with the big red welt on the side of his face?  Experience so already.  He's still got it.  The big red welt.  You're out.  Walk it off. 
[00:45:00]  Walk it off.  Be a man.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  Let's go to the phones here.  Eva.  What's going on?  Eva.  Eva, sorry.  What's up?  No, it's okay.  Listen, first, I just want to...  You're very funny, and I really enjoy you being funny.  You make my day go by quicker.  Wow.  What are you calling Dave?  And also...  What did you say?  You're a joke!  What?  I didn't hear you.  No problem.  Nothing.  Oh.  It wasn't meant for you.  All right.  You're being silly.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:45:30]  And the other thing was, this free-for-all this afternoon was also very funny.  Yeah, it was.  By the way.  The race is going at it.  It was very, very...  I wanted to make a comment, but you guys didn't have time for me.  Anyway, you are...  The one thing I have to say is you're being hypocrites, because it was less than two weeks  ago that you were screaming that you've never, ever been in a shower with any other men  ever.  But in high school, it happens a lot.  Yeah.  So, you're screaming about... 
[00:46:00]  You said just a few minutes ago that, oh yeah, everybody in high school has to take  a shower, blah, blah, blah.  And ha-ha, you're beeping the horn.  That's very funny.  I think you should look.  That's what you get when you try to track this radio show to get hit by the 515, Kate. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, she never saw it coming.  Is the caller there?  Ava?  Hello, Ava.  Ava?  No, she couldn't jump out of the way.  It feels good breaking that out for the new millennium, huh?  Come on!  For the millennium.  Ah, that just felt good.  She never saw it coming.  Getting the first one out of the way.  Who's this?  Yo!  Yeah.  What's your name?  This is Royal.  Royal?  Yep.  Uh-oh.  All right, Royal, what's up? 
[00:47:00]  It's a statistic gym teacher story, and Anthony's little bombardment, or dodgeball story kind  of ties in.  Okay.  Gym teacher, Mr. Warner, we called it a bombardment, and he would line us up on opposite sides of  the basketball court.  Instead of using a red dodgeball, we only wish we had a red dodgeball, because we would use  half-deflated basketballs.  Oh!  And he would go, freshman-verse.  So you've got the varsity pitcher winging half-deflated basketballs, and then he'd say, okay, there'd 
[00:47:30]  be about five freshmen left, and they'd all line up on the wall, just sort of like targets.  And he'd be, okay, upperclassmen anywhere.  If you hit one freshman, your whole team comes back in.  Well, that wasn't good enough.  So he devised a penalty box, and he'd get a wrestling mat, and he'd set it up as like  a box on his edge.  And if he felt, for whatever reason, you were trying deliberately to get out by like sticking 
[00:48:00]  your hand out instead of getting it hit in the head, he'd stick it.  He'd say, all right, shirt's off.  You have to take your shirt off.  Get in the mat.  And then they could just walk up to you and wing you.  You know, your kidneys.  What the hell is wrong with him?  Pretty sadistic.  A lot of them are, man.  These gym teachers, they're just bitter.  There was one in John Glenn who, this big fat guy, used to call him giblets.  And he played for the Denver Broncos until a leg injury ruined his career, and he ends 
[00:48:30]  up being a gym teacher.  This guy was so friggin' bitter, he would just abuse the students.  It was amazing.  He hit some kid with a pipe once.  Another time, he would, if he caught you smoking, he would give you the option.  I will take you down to the office and tell him you were smoking, or you get one punch in  the chest from me.  Get out of here.  Swear to God.  What the hell's wrong with him?  And then you'd go into the locker room, you'd stand there, he'd wind up and punch you in  the chest so friggin' hard, you'd fly across the room. 
[00:49:00]  Didn't he know that's how Harry Houdini died?  Yeah.  And when he hit the kid with the lead pipe, that was when he got fired.  He hit some kid with the lead pipe over the head.  What am I, Mr. Urban Legend guy?  You know me.  I only speak the truth.  It happened.  He's from the East.  In our school, in John Glenn.  Why would he even hit a guy with a lead pipe?  If you knew the kid, you'd have hit him, too.  It was a little Slater, I think. 
[00:49:30]  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what's going on today?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  I just wanted to bring back two games from the old elementary school days.  I went to school in Long Island, and we used to play with the dodgeballs, but there  was a big inflatable medicine ball in the middle that you used to have to hit back and forth.  And it was kind of like a tug-of-war kind of thing.  You had to knock the ball back and forth.  And then the other one was when you used the small balls to play handball. 
[00:50:00]  And your hands used to come out stinging and all red and broken fingers and stuff.  Play asses up handball.  Like a wreck.  I played asses up.  I played asses up.  I would never play asses up.  Hold on.  I played asses up.  That sucked.  You're standing at the wall.  Asses up.  Someone takes the ball and wings it at your ass when you're lost.  And you know what the worst part was?  Not when it hit your ass.  When someone was real good, could ricochet it off the wall.  And nail you in the nuts. 
[00:50:30]  So you did play asses up.  I saw many games of asses up.  I played asses up.  That game sucked.  The best was when they could really aim and just get the skin right here.  Yeah.  Just wing you.  Like below your package, on your leg.  Oh, God.  You guys had the awesome gymnasium curriculum, yo.  Oh, yeah.  You never played asses up or handball?  Look, we had handball.  Like Chinese handball.  You had a drive-by shooting. 
[00:51:00]  What else did you have in your curriculum?  We had bagelology.  Because we used to go to the corner and try different bagels.  Put out a gym class.  Yo, what you having today?  Raisin.  What up, man?  I mean, in New York City public high schools, you know, they're, I mean, if there's not a  football team, you know what I'm saying?  The football team and the baseball team and the basketball team, they get all the props  from the gym teacher.  Hell yeah.  They don't even got to show up.  Right.  You know, they get the little Delaney card.  Oh, that's my center.  Excuse him. 
[00:51:30]  And they'll be in gym like for the whole day.  But the rest of us, you know, we have to thug it out for two periods playing basketball.  And they never gave us, you know, none of that dodgeball.  You know, that was whack, yo.  I think that's why.  Yeah, they just throw you basketballs in the city school.  They're like, yo, here, play.  Odds are a large percentage of the children will enjoy this.  We'll throw them a basketball.  It doesn't matter.  Eli.  Yo, ONA, what's up?  What's up?  How's it going there, guys?  I got a story for you.  Junior high.  Swear to God, we used to do square dancing. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I was there.  What was the meaning to square dancing in school?  Square dancing.  I don't know.  You know what?  I used to say the same thing.  I wasn't going to live down south to be with all the hicks and doing square dancing.  There was one good thing about square dancing, though.  You lined up and you started counting off going, okay, one, two, three.  All right.  I got to change places with the guy in front of me.  You want that chick.  You know, that was the one thing that brought the two.  They flung the doors open.  And the boys met the girls. 
[00:52:30]  Here come the fillies.  And now it was co-ed.  Co-ed.  And you would.  You would line up.  Like Ope said, you're counting because you wanted to be with the girl that you wanted to be with.  But unbeknownst to me.  I wanted to be with Camille, the first girl that grew boobies.  Yeah.  There was a girl I wanted to be with that I can't remember.  And as I'm counting, a girl is counting to be with me.  So it didn't matter where I ended up.  Yes.  Pam Bernfeld. 
[00:53:00]  I ended up across from her.  So there was a problem there.  And, yeah, lined up.  I just remember, okay, hold hands.  Which was kind of cool, though, in like junior high.  Because they'd rig you up with these girls and stuff.  And you'd have to hold hands.  And then when you'd switch partners and stuff, that was kind of cool.  And you're holding hands.  Remember the feeling you get?  It was a great feeling.  Oh, girl hand.  Oh, it's a girl hand.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  And she's holding mine all sweaty and frigging clammy. 
[00:53:30]  You guys look like backwards out there in the island.  Hey, guys.  One more thing.  Southern County.  Come on.  We're playing banjos in our spare time.  Back then, anyway.  I drank mine.  What if you were sick the day they were choosing?  And you come back.  I came back one day.  Then you get the teacher?  And you're like, you're stuck with, like, you know, heinous Helen, who's like this lump  in the corner just finally strolls out.  You know, I would have taken anything back then.  Who cares?  It's female.  You know?  Your dancing is so lame. 
[00:54:00]  You're not thinking about what they look like.  You're just like, oh, female.  They put that cheesy record on.  Yeah, they had the...  Swing your partner round and round.  Beat on the head and throw on the ground.  From an age.  Up and down across the floor.  Now stick it in that filthy whore.  How is that going to benefit us in future life, you know?  Square dancing.  Square dancing.  I'll be in an interview at IBM.  But did you ever square dance? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, damn.  Yeah, I did.  All right.  You got the job.  Hey, John, you're next.  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Dodgeball.  Dodgeball fun.  When I was in high school, they used to line the balls up in the middle of the floor in  a lunchroom.  It was a slick floor, and they'd make everybody run in to get the balls.  Oh, that's good.  So you're two feet away from each other when you first start lunging the balls at each  other.  Yeah, but one of the guys flew on the knee.  They cracked skulls.  One of the guys got knocked unconscious.  He got some brain damage, you know?  Oh, man.  That's great.  They had those red balls.  You could palm the thing.  They were the small ones. 
[00:55:00]  So it would just be in your head.  It would knock you unconscious anyways, man.  That was excellent.  You guys suck, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Look at this guy, Tim.  So we got a guy in asses up who could hit your sack from behind every time.  Like there was a guy that you just know was like, oh, no.  Oh, I got asses up, and it's against this guy.  Oh, the ricochet shot.  Pew.  And do the dodgeball sound effect again.  I love that.  Boom.  And it just flies, right?  It just bounces off your forehead. 
[00:55:30]  That was the same ball they used in kickball.  There's a sport.  Kickball.  We had a girl that struck out in kickball.  Oh, nothing more pathetic than striking out in kickball.  Same girl that would pee her pants, too.  Oh, that's sad.  It was hilarious because, like, where we're from, I mean, you went all the way from kindergarten to high school with the same people.  And you remember this girl as being the one.  I won't even give her name because I'm sure she still lives in Centiport. 
[00:56:00]  But she would strike out in kickball and pee her pants every day.  Oh, my God.  Every day at, like, 1 o'clock where the teacher.  That's horrible.  Where we had the teacher that had the little panties in her drawer that she had to take and then give it to the girl.  And she'd come back in the room.  Oh, that's pretty sad.  To learn some more.  This is the same girl we saw strutting around high school years later.  Like, no one's going to date her.  Is she strutting or just kind of sulking?  Slulking.  But you remember what she used to do and no one wanted to, like, date her because, like, you don't want to be the guy that dated the girl that used to pee herself. 
[00:56:30]  And strike out in kickball.  And I feel a little jealous, man.  What?  I was like an all-American high school experience.  Oh, yeah.  We were out there where there were white people.  You know what I'm saying?  It was amazing.  The Fast Times high school experience.  Yeah, it was like Fast Times.  Well, during what high school I went to?  Same one as Mariah Carey.  Oh, the one she had the show on?  They just did the show on Fox.  Yeah.  And I'm just waiting for the call to come back to my high school.  Oh, yeah.  That phone will be ringing.  Sure, Opie.  We need you at Harborfield. 
[00:57:00]  Spinning records.  Yeah, spin records in the cafeteria.  Ed and I want to go back to my high school and then we'll go to Aunt's high school, John Glenn, and we want to do a live radio show.  Well, I wanted to last year.  I don't know what.  Maybe we'll have less of a problem this year since we're so world-renowned now, our show.  So popular.  Maybe I could get my diploma from John Glenn.  No, I needed gym credit.  I swear I need gym credit.  So I'm willing to come in and attend a gym class if they give me my diploma from John Glenn. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  I would damn well do that.  Get in touch with John Glenn High School.  Tell him I want my goddamn diploma.  I'll go to gym.  I'll dress in the shorts.  I'll climb the rope.  Yo, that'd be awesome.  Yeah.  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  Then maybe I could get a real job.  See, kids, you don't need a high school education.  No, kids, drop out.  You don't need it.  Just drop out.  Look at your pal, Aunt.  Colleen, what's up? 
[00:58:00]  Hey, how are you?  Great.  I am a female phys ed teacher in New York City.  Okay.  In Brooklyn.  And I am most definitely not a bike.  You got the short, spiky hair on top, long in the back?  I don't have short, spiky hair on the top.  You like looking at the naked little nymphs?  Colleen, I got a question for you.  Yes.  So why didn't you pay attention in school?  I did.  I know she wanted to be a...  See, now I have this argument all the time.  What did you want to be before you said, you know what, screw it, I'm going to be a gym teacher?  It's phys ed.  Phys ed.  Oh, phys ed. 
[00:58:30]  It's not gym anymore.  Okay.  She's going to be a physical therapist.  I can't tell you.  I have 20 credits in science that I had to take to get a degree.  I thought I was going to be a ballerina.  No, I was not.  That is not my thing.  All right.  But I don't teach dodgeball.  No?  No.  So...  You didn't have any kind of aspirations towards, you know, like sports or something?  Like being the home ec teacher?  You didn't think...  No, I did not want to be the home ec teacher.  When you were growing up, you didn't possibly say to yourself, I want to be a female gym teacher.  Phys ed.  Phys ed gym teacher. 
[00:59:00]  Well, in college, that's what I decided.  You got a chrome whistle?  Come on, ladies.  We're going to go on the balance beam.  We don't have mats, so I'll act as the mat today.  You don't need those pesky underwear.  Oh, stop.  I'll just stand here.  Oh, look at you, you little thing.  Wow, it's still in the shape of a diamond.  I see, girl.  It's not at all even remotely like that.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen plenty.  They are. 
[00:59:30]  No, but I'm not.  Come on.  You can't lump us all together.  I'm sorry.  My husband would disagree with you.  Ah, what's her name?  He's not going to be happy.  He's listening.  Pat.  The androgynous Pat.  There you go.  Oh, we're just messing with you, Colleen.  That's fine.  All right.  All right.  Very well.  Have a good night.  You too, Colleen.  Bye.  Bye.  A woman's perspective on gyms.  Vicki.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  Very good.  I tried being in seventh grade with a C cup playing medicine ball. 
[01:00:00]  Nice.  You had a couple of medicine balls of your own.  Yeah, I did.  I was the first one to develop.  Oh, God.  The guys have never forgotten you.  To this day, they mention your name.  Yeah, they know they come up to me now.  Ready?  I'll play it with everyone in the room.  Okay.  And first girl that grew boobs.  I don't remember last name, but first name.  Sixth grade, Cuba Hill Elementary School.  Jerry.  Jerry was her name.  Rick?  Go to Old Dirty first.  She kicked me in the crotch, too. 
[01:00:30]  Everyone in their car right now is naming a name.  Every guy.  For me, it was Camille Brumner.  Oh, I'm flattered.  This is terrible, though.  Those medicine balls are hurt.  Is it Maribel?  You know what Old Dirty's problem is?  You can't think back to second grade.  Oh, don't make fun of Old Dirty.  He went to a rough school.  Defend me.  Old Dirty, just remember, the last time you were in school.  Oh, man.  You guys make me laugh today with this stuff.  And I got to tell you about the square dancing. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  The girls, they hated it, but inside, they loved it.  They wanted to dance with the boys.  They had their pick.  And you're right.  They did pick their man.  Let me tell you something.  I didn't mind the square dancing because we got to touch female.  Yeah, that was the whole thing.  Even just touching hands was pretty cool.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There was always so many.  And if you didn't like the girl you were with, they would do that thing where it's like,  you know, exchange your partner.  Uh-huh.  And you go forward.  The four would be gone.  You go across.  And at that age, they didn't even care.  It was female.  All that mattered to me.  No, girls are different, though.  See, girls get together. 
[01:01:30]  Because what is that?  That's like third or fourth grade, right?  Sometimes you have fairs.  It never made it to junior high.  It was grammar school.  Yeah.  But the girls, they sit together and they go, okay, you can have this guy today.  Right.  And unless they fight over it.  All right.  So, thank you.  Thank you, Vicki.  Take care, guys.  With the lovely.  Are they still C's or are they up to D's?  I'm very short.  They're still C's.  Okay.  All right.  You want to square dance?  If you want to.  A little dirty, trying to make a move.  Uh, Brian, you're next.  Hey.  Hey.  O&A?  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, what's going on?  All right.  Uh, I went to school growing up in Manhattan.  Junior high school, high school, elementary school, everything.  We played kill the man with the ball.  Kill the guy with the ball.  Remember that game?  In our neighborhood.  Football, no rules.  You just kill the guy with the ball.  In our neighborhood, it was called Smear the Queer.  Yeah, we played that out.  I swear to you.  We played that out.  We didn't know what queer meant back then, but that was the name of the game.  Yeah, we played it on concrete.  Right.  Like out in the street.  I remember getting tackled and I got, I lost one of my teeth.  And the whole, both teams are running around the park looking for my tooth. 
[01:02:30]  There was always, there was always a guy that just, just, I mean, you're playing like  kill the guy with the ball and his arm would just snap and the bone would pop right through.  There was always one guy.  Exactly.  All right, man.  Exactly.  And then growing up in school, you know, we played that in high school, in junior high  school.  And then when I went to junior high school, I went to the lower east side of Manhattan.  Yeah.  And then it was more just like kill anybody.  It turned into like kill the white guy.  Forget about kill the man with the ball. 
[01:03:00]  It was just kill the white guy.  All right.  Well, thank you, Brian.  You're welcome.  I want to take a break, but Russ swears that he had a midget gym teacher.  Oh, come on.  Hey, Russ.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Hey, forget about it.  Forget about it.  What's up, Russ?  Yeah.  In high school, we had a midget gym teacher.  I am not lying.  Oh, my God.  He was about four foot.  We called him Oompa Loompa.  Totally didn't get nothing done.  Oompa Loompa.  I swear to God.  So, hey, you can go to my own high school and just like pass this class. 
[01:03:30]  That's weird, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really weird.  I mean, we had like a normal gym teacher.  Of course, the lesbian gym teacher for the girls.  But you had like mini me teaching your gym.  Yeah.  Mini me was the gym teacher.  And we just like totally, you know, towards the end, he was like asking us, just do one  or something.  That's pretty weird.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Russ.  Bye.  Bye.  And with that, let's take a quick break.  We'll be back, okay?  All right. 
[01:04:00]  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention.  I'm a virgin.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A four-hour parade of meat.  Hey, it happened.  I'm feeling glad I got sunshine.  In a bag, I'm useless.  Not for long, my future is coming on.  Hey, it happened.  I'm feeling glad I got sunshine. 
[01:04:30]  In a bag, I'm useless.  Not for long, my future is coming on.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  My future.  Anthony, let's get into the Dice phone call from yesterday.  Moving in now.  You want to set it up real fast or what?  Well, we were sitting here yesterday doing our little show. 
[01:05:00]  Dice had called for my birthday.  And he called up yesterday out of nowhere to say that his appearance on the program for my birthday inspired him in some way, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  To, you know, get back into it.  Get a CD out.  Get touring again.  Because he had such a good time.  And he called us and wanted to tell us about that.  Yeah.  And he sounded a little weird, man.  Yeah, the first few minutes of the call is Ant and I just being stupefied.  I didn't know he was playing a joke or something. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, because we're just sitting here like, we inspired you?  I mean, you know, being a kid growing up on Long Island and discovering comedy and stuff, I mean...  Oh, everyone remembers the first time you saw Dice.  He was like, oh, my God, this is brand new.  He was a hero growing up.  And now he's saying that you and I have inspired him.  Inspired him.  That's just a little strange.  But after the initial weirdness, it just goes into some classic Dice.  Really, really funny stuff.  If you stick around, you'll hear about yam bags and... 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that's great.  And midgets.  Gotta love them.  Andrew Dice Clay calling the show.  Is that the real Dice calling in today?  I don't know.  Dice?  Yeah.  Hey, Dice.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  You're on the air.  What's up?  What's going on?  You have nothing to do today?  You had a call?  Where are you?  You don't think it's me?  It is definitely.  No, it's you.  No, you want to know the truth, why I'm calling in?  Why?  I know it's going to sound crazy to you.  Yeah.  But I had such a good time talking to you guys last week. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  And I had to call you and just tell you because it was such a jolt.  You know, like when I called in, I thought I'd just call in.  And happy birthday, you know, to Bo.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But you guys were so terrific.  And it became so much fun.  It like made me want to do stuff again.  I'm telling you the truth.  And I wanted to call you and tell you.  I mean, that's what you did.  That's what, like, you got me like crazy.  Really?  You're like the soft, sensitive Dice here. 
[01:07:00]  No, no, I'm not being soft and sensitive.  I mean, that's a side to me, that is.  It was like, I was thinking about it all.  I mean, I got on stage every night after that.  Yeah.  You know, because there's been certain things going on that I didn't feel like doing.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, there's this, uh, you got to understand, and you'll see what I'm talking about, like  with, uh, Anthony, like, you know, I was goofing on the, um, you know, the, uh, you know,  the whole divorce situation.  Sure. 
[01:07:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But don't think I don't feel bad for you, also.  I wanted you to know that.  Oh, Dice, thank you.  Yeah, because I know what somebody goes through.  I've been down that road.  Yeah.  Well, we're, nah, we, we know you were joking with us.  No, I know, and it's a lot of fun, and I love destroying people and ripping people to  shreds.  You know, and that, you know, and it brings, you know, like, when we talk about your misery.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's fun for everyone else.  Your life is basically in the dungeon now. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  You know, and then, you know, we could all laugh about it, but then you're in a courtroom  and she's taking every penny you're going to make for the next 20 years.  Hey, wait, was that you in the, was that you on the back bench?  Was that you on the back bench?  It's fun for me because I'm thinking, hey, boy, I'm glad I'm not him.  You know what I mean?  Well, you're making me feel better already, Dice.  You know what I mean?  But I've been down that road.  Right.  You know, when you get your heart ripped out, and then, you know, you go home from,  after being on the radio show, and now you're sitting there all along going, I hate me. 
[01:08:30]  I hate the life I'm leading.  I'm on the radio every day making people laugh.  In the meantime, you're getting your heart torn out because of the black midget wrestling.  But I also understand that end of it.  Well, Dice, I'm doing it.  But on the other end, you know, that's what you've got to do to make people laugh.  Right.  You know what I mean? 
[01:09:00]  But it's not all doom and gloom.  I mean, I'm doing it right for myself.  But I actually called in on a day I wasn't feeling too great about me.  You weren't?  Dice, what's going on?  No, and everybody has those days.  Dice, what was going on?  Dice, let me interrupt you really fast and just say that your call last week on the radio  was one of the best things we've done since we went back to New York.  Really?  The feedback, the email, the phone calls after you hung up was unbelievable.  You're a funny son of a bitch.  Everybody wants to hear that segment again.  I love doing comedy, but that particular day, it's like I got this thing. 
[01:09:30]  And, you know, I've really, you know, I've really, you know, I've been working on like  a new, like two hours of material.  And like I told you, I've been playing, you know, just the Venetian in Vegas.  Vegas.  And from what I heard, I don't want to go, you know, I know what it is when I put something  out and I know what I have to absorb.  Dice, is it true?  You're one of the highest, you are the highest paid comic in Vegas?  Yeah.  All right.  I heard that on you.  That's not the point.  You know, I've, you know, come on, you know, everybody knows what I've done.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  I create a history in a lot of ways that, you know, I get comics coming over to me all 
[01:10:00]  the time going, the only reason I became a comic is because of you, you know, and that's  a good feeling.  Right.  But I know when I put something out, you know, what I'm going to have to deal with as far  as media and, you know, the women's groups.  You've got to deal with everything that you've been dealing with for many years.  Yeah, I've been dealing with it for a long time.  So, you know, a couple of weeks ago, you've heard of like EMI Capital.  So, you know. 
[01:10:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  So they want to do this.  You know, they see me working and they go, if we put an album out with you, this thing  is going to sell 8 million copies.  All right.  And I was at the point where I was like, you know what?  I don't need it.  I don't need that pressure on my back anymore.  Right.  You know what I mean?  But after I like spoke to you, the next day I called my manager.  I said, you know what?  Make the deal.  Screw everything.  Let's put this thing through the roof and just shut everybody's mouth once and for all.  Yeah.  Look at that.  You know what I mean?  That's how I felt on the radio, especially once like Jay Moore called in. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  You know, because he was a lot of fun, that guy.  Oh, without a doubt.  You know what I mean?  He's, you know, he's pretty funny.  The Jay Dice thing was so friggin' funny to listen back to, man.  Everybody wants to hear it again.  We're going to have to replay it the next time we're going to get it off.  And then Corb Zordichetti was telling me he wanted to, you know, afterwards, he goes,  don't you know who this Jay Moore is?  Because I wasn't sure who he was.  Yeah.  You know, he goes, that's the guy I told you wanted to break your records at Rascals.  See, even that made me feel good because here's another comic I really don't know, 
[01:11:30]  and he wants to break the records I've done.  Right.  Which is impossible.  Impossible.  Impossible.  We did sell out like 10 shows for Jay Moore.  10 shows is nothing.  We would do 10 shows a week.  You know, it's Rascals.  It's 400 seats.  That's nothing for sure.  Yeah, there we go.  You know, it's a great club.  It's probably the best club in the, you know, the whole area of Jersey over there.  But, you know, but what I'm saying is the point that he wants to break those records 
[01:12:00]  Right.  says something to me.  It's like, you know what?  Get up, bang out another album, do another special,  and through the world.  So you're doing it.  That's the gift I was given.  So you're going to tour.  You're going to get your ass to New York and get on this show live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I'm thinking about like even when you were on the radio.  Yeah.  You know, like all the people riding around that are coming from jobs.  You know how they say, no matter what you do for a living, you hate your job.  Right.  Sometimes even a comic hates getting on stage and making other people laugh.  But that's the job. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  I mean, most of the time I feel good when I got to go on stage.  But there were those nights where you go, I'm just not into it.  But yet once you're up there, hey, those people are paying money.  Those people want to laugh.  And those are the people that are running the whole world.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  You know, a guy taking, you know, the $2 at the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel is not exactly  thrilled when he leaves the house going, oh, what a day I'm going to have.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  I get to take that. 
[01:13:00]  I'm the toll taker.  You know what I mean?  Boy, I'm excited about this.  Sure.  But he does the job.  Right.  He gets up, he goes, he does it.  Hey, Dice, are you having a nervous breakdown or something?  No.  I'm just telling you that you guys gave me like a surge of energy.  All right.  A little incentive.  So, Dice, we gave you a gift.  Are you going to give us a gift in return?  Well, that's what I'm doing.  I'm telling you.  So I called up the next day.  I said, you know what?  Make the deal for the album.  Let's put the album out.  And let's make people go ballistic from this thing. 
[01:13:30]  Well, that's not a gift.  Because I know the material I've been doing lately.  Yeah.  And I watch HBO and, you know, all those cable shows and all these comics.  Yeah.  And I go, you know, it's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them.  You know what I mean?  Especially the ones trying to be filthy.  To be a dirty, filthy animal is something you've got to practice day in and day out.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  I hear you, Dice.  Dice, Mark's on the line.  He says this isn't the suicide prevention hotline.  You might have misdialed. 
[01:14:00]  What are you talking about?  This guy, Mark, he said he wants...  Hold on.  You can talk to him yourself.  Hold on.  Uh, Mark.  Hey, Dice.  What are you, dying?  What's happening here?  Stop drinking, you son of a gun, you.  What are you talking about?  What?  It sounds like this is a suicide prevention hotline.  What's going on?  So what's your problem?  Talk to me.  I can help you.  You need the help, buddy.  What are you talking about?  Hey, how about some drugs, eh?  Wait a minute.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't know you were the boss of me.  I think you've got to give me a sweat for that.  The whole point of this call was that I was, like, feeling bad, like, you know, with Anthony, 
[01:14:30]  you know, how your dog is?  All right, hold on.  Wait a minute.  Get out of here.  Let me get rid of him.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Dice.  All right, Dice, who was that?  I got rid of him.  Go ahead.  Unbelievable.  So now you're inspired.  You're going to put out...  Exactly.  That's what you guys did.  God, we can't even...  We haven't had that much fun in a long time doing that.  We can't even inspire ourselves.  I don't know how we did that for you.  You inspired me being filthy.  Being filthy.  I understand.  Yeah.  It's like I was so excited the other morning. 
[01:15:00]  I woke up, right?  I'm crazy over here.  Shut your mouth when I talk.  Did you wake up with a...  I woke up the other morning.  I start like...  You know, when you...  Well, you used to know because you were married.  Yeah.  So I'm banging the wife.  Right?  I mean, really banging her.  You know, like when you're married,  some of the lust goes out.  Sure, sure.  You know what I mean?  But I mean, after I spoke to you guys,  the next day, I mean, I'm whaling a whale  like a frigging jackhammer.  Bouncing her off the walls, 
[01:15:30]  throwing her up in the air,  spinning her around.  She falls right on my peg.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the alarm goes.  Oh, she wakes up.  It kills the whole thing.  I just want to ask.  You weren't...  Did you see what happened there?  That was a joke.  Good for me.  I'm over here.  I just want to ask.  You didn't have like an image of Anna  or myself in your brain  while you were doing your wife.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, all right.  You're the last thing I think about.  All right.  I just needed to ask.  The only time I think about you  was when I talked to you.  Yeah.  What about the banana juice? 
[01:16:00]  Was that flowing nicely?  That was banana juice all over the room.  Yeah, okay.  There were people that, you know,  in L.A.  They're in cars.  They could just slide to work now  after what I did.  Well, this is a great little phone call.  I'm good.  Well, I just wanted to tell you  because it, like, you know,  I got a call from a comic the other day.  This is another...  You know, because comedians are normally,  you know, miserable.  Sure.  You know, you're a comic.  You know what I'm talking about.  Sure.  You do a voice or two.  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  Occasionally. 
[01:16:30]  But this guy calls me up because,  guys, do you ever just feel doom?  You know?  Doom?  That's what happens to a comic.  He does, like, a great set,  comes on stage,  and then he wants to call your friend Mark.  Guys, it sounds to me like  you might have some anxiety issues.  Yeah, I do.  I go through that a lot.  You get the anxiety attacks?  Yeah.  You want to know something?  You know Club Soda, Kenny.  Sure.  You know Happy Face.  You met him.  He was up there with me.  Yeah.  That by the time I go on stage in Vegas, 
[01:17:00]  these guys have just had it with me.  Really?  Yeah.  Because all day...  Like, we go to the gym, right?  Because, you know,  the new nickname for me is The Body.  Oh, Dice, The Body.  Yeah, The Body.  You know what I'm talking about.  Well, I saw the Eat True Hollywood story,  and you on that Stairmaster  looked pretty good there, Dice.  No, no, no, no.  The home video of you on the Stairmaster.  Right.  Forget about that.  I'm physically fit.  Okay.  Forget that.  I smoke on the treadmill.  Nothing bothers me. 
[01:17:30]  But the point is,  so we do this workout.  It's a very intense workout, right?  Right.  Every day.  You know,  you're talking like 30 sets of weights.  You're talking 1,000 sit-ups.  You're talking 40 minutes on the treadmill.  Really work.  And then a half hour after that,  it's like,  what's this pain?  What's this pain?  Why is my neck bothering me?  Why is my back...  That by the time I'm going on stage,  these guys are just like thrilled  to get rid of me for the hour and a half.  Maybe you're working out too hard. 
[01:18:00]  No, no.  But they go,  Andrew,  you're not getting a heart attack.  Nothing's going on here.  Oh,  because you got a little hypochondria too.  You work out like an animal.  You climb frigging mountains in L.A.  And all you got to do  is go on and insult people in the front row.  So is that what it is?  You get a little hypochondria too?  Yeah, you get...  Yeah.  I got a brain tumor over here.  You get the hypochondriac,  the panic attacks,  the anxiety.  Yeah.  And then you go on  and you curse some filthy animal  in the front row out  and you feel better.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  You know what I mean?  It sounds to me  like the dice is a little deeper  than everyone thinks.  He goes home at night,  starts thinking about some of this crap  and works himself up into a tizzy.  Yeah, exactly.  You go through that?  Yeah, I used to.  Like with this whole divorce thing,  what are you going through?  No, nothing.  Like, you know something years ago...  Don't lie to me.  Dice, I swear,  it's in first gear right now,  this divorce thing.  When it reaches fourth gear,  I'll talk to you.  No, but like,  when was the actual split up?  Eh, like, what, fall?  In the fall?  Yeah.  Now, was this the type of thing 
[01:19:00]  where you didn't catch it, did you?  No, no.  I wanted out, Dice.  Oh, you wanted out?  Yeah.  So what am I trying to help you for?  I don't know.  I'm fine.  I was, like, feeling bad for you.  That's what we were trying to tell you.  I'm going to be on the air,  you know,  so I thought she had, like,  an affair or something  with the midget.  No, there was no midget, Dice.  So who's the black midget wrestler?  I'm dating the black midget wrestler.  So you put a scam on me? 
[01:19:30]  Guys, I explain.  I'm walking around feeling bad,  telling my wife,  I'm on the phone with Opie and Anthony,  and his wife went with this.  He told me, like,  there's black midget wrestler.  You know,  and, you know,  it's a big joke to everybody listening,  but the guy's probably feeling bad about it.  No.  No, that ain't the way it happened.  But I understand what you're talking about.  Years ago,  I went through a time  where I didn't know why,  but I was getting these anxiety attacks.  And it was right.  And so what'd you do?  I don't know.  It just kind of stopped there for a while. 
[01:20:00]  You started going with the black midget wrestler.  That'll cure anything that ails you, Dice.  No, it just kind of,  I think I finally just said,  hey, screw this, man.  You know,  if it had...  But if you went with the midget,  right?  Yeah.  Or whoever it was,  what, you're missing a leg?  No.  No, I...  Maybe I got it a little off.  She was missing something, right?  To be honest with you,  no, it wasn't a midget,  it wasn't a black midget  or anything like that.  I'm doing...  You don't got nothing against black midgets, 
[01:20:30]  do you?  Everything.  I would love to do a black midget.  You like those fingers  that look like Vienna sausages?  You want that touching you?  Yeah, you know, a midget dog  is two inches too short  to whack the bag anyway.  You know what I mean?  It's a punishment being a midget.  Little bow leg.  Did you ever think about that?  What, a punishment being a midget?  Yeah, well, think about it.  If it wasn't a punishment,  you know how everybody says  they want to be reincarnated?  Right.  Well, you know,  not everybody's so good.  You know what I mean?  Like O.J.  will come back as a midget.  A midget?  Jeffrey Dahmer will be a midget.  Hitler will be a friggin' midget.  So you know what God says? 
[01:21:00]  He goes,  all right,  this is what I do for you.  Look at me now.  I give you a little  tonkatoi body  and I snap on  a 78-pound friggin' head.  Go ahead, go back.  Here's a little knife.  You could cut people's shins, O.J.  Get out of here.  You know,  and your arms are gonna be  two inches too short  to whack the bed.  Come on.  Could you imagine  not being able  to pull out the bucket  of the banana juice?  You want to talk  about a punishment?  You've got to put that  on your new album, right?  I come up with ways. 
[01:21:30]  I make it exciting.  I lay on my arm  for a half hour  towards a dead  like a piece of meat  and it's almost like  a strange chick  doing it to you.  Sure.  I've tried that one.  That's pretty cool.  I mean, think about it.  The whole midget situation.  Yeah.  It's the first thing you do  when you wake up  and your arm is asleep.  I'm gonna touch myself.  Exactly.  That's how my mind works.  Because we're all  a bunch of filthy animals.  That's how my mind works.  Could you imagine  being a kid  and having parents 
[01:22:00]  instead of midgets?  Think about that.  Because, you know,  I studied  the whole midget phonology  and they could grow  real people.  Sure.  Yeah.  Can you imagine  you're 12 years old?  You're like 7'2".  Your parents are midgets.  You're in the house.  What are we talking about  over here?  I'm over here now.  What do you think?  You're gonna wait  till you're 16th  to take the car?  You tell your father,  hey, pup,  jump out of the heights here.  I want to talk  to you a minute now.  Give me the keys  to the car.  And this little  four-foot-two idiot  is like going, 
[01:22:30]  I don't think  it's a good idea.  Oh, you don't?  How about I take  all the food  from the fridge,  stick it in the freezer.  I'll starve you to death,  you little hard-on.  Get out of here.  Go ride the dog  around the house.  Oh, my God.  It's a punishment.  I'm telling you something.  I studied it.  My friend tells me.  Dice, you are born again.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  You have a new life here.  You have a new outlook.  No, but I think  about these things.  Nobody's thinking  about midgets.  How about a thank you 
[01:23:00]  on the new album?  Yeah, all right.  I'll give you a thank you.  All right, good.  That's a nice little gift.  You're inspiring it  because you went  with the little black  midget legless wrestler.  You know what I mean?  You know,  I'm just thinking  about like,  you know,  how nobody wakes up  in the morning  thinking,  how can I help  a midget today?  What can I do personally  to make the life of it?  And you never see them  during the day.  By throwing them a bang.  You know,  but where do you see  midgets hanging out?  Nah, I think a science  is going to end to midgets.  You're going to magic 
[01:23:30]  and a midget comes over.  Can I help you  with a new suit?  Never.  Hey, let me stand on you  to reach that shirt.  Come on.  Never.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now  because you said.  Well, there's radio,  there's edgy,  there's psychotic,  and then there's ONA.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You guys are an  undisciplined child  wielding ultimate power. 
[01:24:00]  212-757-1027  is our phone line.  It's the ONA show.  We're in the middle  of the DICE phone call  Anthony.  Huh?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Part two of the phone call.  Let's get right into the call  so we can do some other stuff.  Sure.  All right, so I guess  part two of the phone call  starts with DICE  telling us that he can do 
[01:24:30]  a really good Christopher Walken  impression, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right, we'll be back.  Check this out.  The second part of the DICE call.  I've been practicing  Chris Walken  going into a club.  Let me hear.  Let's hear it.  I don't know if it's that good.  Uh-oh.  Let me hear.  So you got to say...  Here we go.  So I say to you,  I'm going to say,  uh,  are there babes?  And then you say,  yeah.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Let me get into  Chris Walker mode. 
[01:25:00]  Are there babes?  Yeah.  Then let me in.  Sounds like DICE  Walken.  All right, let me try it again.  Let me get more into it.  Are there babes?  Wait a minute.  Now it's more like DICE.  Do your mind.  No, it's more DICE than...  Let's try it again.  All right, let's try it again.  Are there babes?  Yeah.  Wait, let me try it different.  All right, let's go.  Are there little  lick it up,  filthy little slob?  Oh, that's Walken, yeah.  That's perfect now. 
[01:25:30]  That's perfect now.  All right, so you got to do your line.  Yeah.  Are there little...  No, not yet.  Did I say no?  What are we, playing Simple Simon?  You want to get into acting one day?  You do what I tell you to do  and I tell you to do it  and that's that  because I'm over here.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  We hear you.  Are there little midget babes?  Yeah.  Then let me in.  How's that?  That was pretty good.  You almost had a Gleason thing  at the end.  I could do anybody. 
[01:26:00]  Then let me in.  All I used to do  was impressions.  Remember Ed Sullivan?  Sure.  Yeah.  Hey, we got a great  friggin' show for you  to see tonight.  We got a Toto G. Joe,  the little Puerto Rican mouse  running around  doing this  and he got a friggin' thing.  I could do anybody.  What do you like?  That's pretty good, Dice.  All right, do Travolta.  Do Travolta.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  All right, let me get into it now.  All right.  Dice doing Travolta.  Listen to this.  You're going to die.  I swear you're going to crack up, right? 
[01:26:30]  It's like the other day  Mr. Carter says to me,  he says,  Vinny,  did you do your homework?  What?  You say I do it perfect.  That's pretty good, Dice.  I'll give you that one.  Wow.  Who else could you do?  I'm a-loving,  flamey,  sloppy pig.  You know,  that kind of stuff.  Well,  what he must have done  to that Olivia Newton,  John,  I'd have to get in there  if I worked with her.  I don't know.  She looked pretty skinny and great.  Oh, please.  When she put those- 
[01:27:00]  You put them black tights  down the way she had them.  Yeah.  You get behind her  with your hairy banana.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Everybody goes home  a winner with me.  You know what I mean?  You freaking madman, Dice.  How long am I going to talk  about midgets?  I bet you got every midget  in the metropolitan area  listening now going,  well,  what's the problem  with us now?  I think we're-  They're not doing concerts  in New York.  You know,  they'll surround Carnegie Hall  with midgets.  At least, yeah,  there aren't too many of them. 
[01:27:30]  Ticketing midgets.  We have a midget  coming in next week.  You know what?  Maybe they'll double up  and put on a long black coat  like the Hasidics.  Yeah.  And act like real people.  We have a midget whore  coming in next week.  Yeah, well,  that sounds real exciting.  She does porno.  You know what I mean?  You could stick around  your pegs,  shave, shower,  they don't get in the way.  You throw them in a drawer  when you're done with them.  Yeah, fix my T-shirts.  I'll be back in an hour, honey.  What does a midget do for work?  What, do you put them  on a broom handle  to hit those hard-to-clean places?  Come on. 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  Hey, Billy wants you  to do corn on the cob.  Well, the thing with corn,  did you ever notice  that after you eat it,  even if it comes out  like three days later,  it like puts itself  back together.  It's like a magical,  you know,  what is it?  It's a food.  Steak, protein.  I don't know what it is.  Corn has like its own life.  You know what I mean?  No matter how you, 
[01:28:30]  and when I eat corn,  I make sure to chew it.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Because then I'm just amazed  of what it can do  on its own.  Sometimes it actually  comes out on the cob again.  You know what I'm saying?  You got some chicks  up there today.  What's going on?  No, we don't have  any girls in here today.  No.  Where's that one  that you were hanging with,  Opie?  That's Sandy.  Who's that?  Sandy, my girlfriend.  Oh, Sandy.  You're a filthy animal. 
[01:29:00]  She loves when  you talk dirty to her.  Did you ever say that  to a girl in bed?  Filthy animal?  You girls love  that kind of romantic talk.  That's the thing, Anthony.  If you're going to get  serious with somebody,  and you get in bed with them,  you've got to be yourself.  Don't play no games.  I usually do dice.  No, forget about doing dice.  That's a good one.  It's like,  I'm going to bang,  I'm going to bang that ass,  honey.  I'm going to bang  that big, fat,  frumpy, dumpy,  dimple-ridden  banana-filled days.  And I like them  a little older,  you know what I mean? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You know,  where it's like,  where it's got like  a hundred thousand miles  of banana on it already.  You know,  we'll dent it up,  the front end's  a little lopsided.  Sure.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm over here.  Looks like she's been  sitting in the gravel  driveway too long.  You know?  I'm good like that.  Yeah, okay.  And I like aunt.  Oh, really?  You know what I mean?  That's why after I,  um,  I unload the mule juice  all over,  I normally take a picture  and I frame it  for people to look at  in my living room.  It's beautiful. 
[01:30:00]  They go,  look at that.  Look what he did again.  That's what you got to say  after you're in bed  with a chick.  And each one's different.  Just after you're  completely done  and you're sweating,  you know,  you just look over  at her belly  and go,  look what I did  to you again.  Always say again.  It's very important.  Again.  I'm writing all  this stuff down,  Doug.  So this way  when you break up,  you know how many times  I said again to you? 
[01:30:30]  You know,  and then she's got to  move on to the next guy,  these stupid animals.  They wanted to have jobs.  They didn't know  when it was good for them.  Sure.  Hey, Dice,  is your wife home?  They're home,  watch your soap operas,  drink coffee,  and wait for me  to come home  with the banana  swinging out of my pants.  You know what I mean?  No,  they wanted to work.  And then at 35 years old,  they don't feel like  getting up in the snow anymore  and cleaning the ice  off the windshield  and heating up the car.  It's not so much fun  to be a career woman then. 
[01:31:00]  Living on your own.  Yeah, okay, big shot.  You are off, man.  I think your ass  is hanging down  to your knees.  Nobody's looking at you.  Okay?  You were 20 years old.  You thought you were  a big shot.  Now look at you now.  That's what I say.  Holy smart, Dice.  You know what I mean?  Jesus Christ.  You know what really  gets me crazy?  What?  You know that we're  living like in a,  you know,  everybody's going,  you know,  I got my home office.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  That was,  that's what makes  women smarter than  men.  You see,  the only time men  were able to get away  from these nitwits  they marry  is in the morning  when they,  you know,  you make believe  you don't want  to go to work.  Oh, honey,  it's cold.  I don't want to go.  Oh, see you later.  Then the minute  you get in the car,  you're blasting the radio.  You're looking at  all these,  these,  these big,  busted,  filthy animals  in the cars next to you.  Then you get to work,  right?  Yeah.  And the first thing 
[01:32:00]  you see is the receptionist  with the little pigtails  with the red blouse  half open  and those big  McGuffys  hanging out.  And all the guy  is thinking is,  boy,  would I love  to get this idiot  in the pencil room.  You know what I mean?  Boy,  would I like to sit  that fat ass  on the copy machine  as she's screaming,  more banana,  more banana,  as your yam bag  is smacking  against her ass  and you're taking  pictures of it. 
[01:32:30]  That's all a guy  is thinking,  no matter what  she's saying.  No, no,  I'm the problem.  I'm the bad guy,  right?  Your yam bag.  I make all this up.  Jesus Christ,  you're killing me,  though.  Your yam bag  is slamming.  What are you called?  That's like the normal  terminology.  I gotta come up  with, like,  when I call you guys,  I gotta, like,  think on my feet,  like, what can I call,  like, uh,  whatever it is.  The yam bag,  I love it.  The yam bag,  mayonnaise bag,  meal bag,  whatever you wanna call it.  We use banana sack. 
[01:33:00]  We use banana juice  all the time now  because of you.  Thank you.  You can,  you touch my thing.  I knew that'd piss you off.  You know what I mean?  We give you the credit.  But instead of being able  to go to work  and do that  and come home  eight o'clock at night,  no, it's like,  honey,  I'm going into my room now.  I'm going into my room  all alone  that this moron  you live with  is coming in like  on like the hour.  How is it going?  You're not hanging out  with the guys 
[01:33:30]  in the park  looking at all these animals,  these smelling good animals.  No,  you're in a room  walking around.  Oh, yeah,  I'm on my lunch break.  There's a bird on the roof.  I'm feeding that now.  That's what everybody wanted.  That's how dumb,  that's how dumb we are.  Oh, my God.  You're going to work  having an affair  on the side,  which is the only reason  to get married  is to have an affair.  You know,  in my,  I mean,  you can't have one  without it. 
[01:34:00]  You know what I mean?  It's not having an affair  unless you're married.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the beauty of it.  If you're just  banging some chick,  you know,  and you tell your friend,  yeah, so what,  I'm banging a chick too.  But if you know  you've got somebody at home  that you're going to make  miserable by the end  of this thing,  you know,  then there's a challenge  that brings excitement  into the marriage.  Oh, I'm,  you know,  like,  you know,  you can tell,  why did you bang her?  It was an accident.  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  What do you want from me? 
[01:34:30]  Monogamy.  Cut your ass with it.  Goddamn dice.  In my mother's life,  every time I'm having an affair,  you know,  why'd you do,  you know,  when we were in a room,  everybody felt awkward,  and the minute I hopped on her,  you know,  everything loosened up.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  You know,  but then I tell her,  I'm over here now.  Can we put this out  on CD for you?  No.  Don't do me no favor.  Don't go into a recording studio.  Just get the tape from us  for your last two appearances. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, got it.  I guess I say to my wife,  because it's very hot out  in LA now.  Yeah.  So I say,  you know,  you know,  it's hot.  You know,  she wants to lay in the sun  and I'd rather,  you know,  get just between her legs  or something.  So I said,  you know,  let's go in the house  and bang,  you know,  and she's like,  I'm not in the mood.  I go,  there are no choices here.  That's what marriage  is all about.  This is not a choice.  I'm not asking.  Come on.  And then once you get them going,  they always get in the mood anyway. 
[01:35:30]  You know,  you might have to rip  a piece of clothing off  or something,  but that turns them on sometimes.  You know what I mean?  Wow.  I hear you, Dice.  You got some stuff  in your head, Dice.  Oh my God.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You're killing me.  That's what I think.  I don't know.  That's some good thinking.  Lots of people checking in  on instant feedback.  Dice is killing me.  What's instant feedback?  Well,  we get this instant feedback  on the,  on the computer.  Oh yeah,  not a computer idiot.  Computer idiot.  It's a simple thing.  It's called like email. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know about these things.  You got to get online, Dice.  You got to get online, Dice.  I'm not in this century,  my friend.  Some of the best porno.  I still like to go out,  smoke,  throw a few drinks back.  I don't heck in Beijing.  You know what I mean?  I get on a hardwire phone.  Oh,  I didn't know this was  the wrong number.  What's your name,  honey?  20 minutes later,  I'll give you a call  another time.  Click.  Local calls.  Local calls.  Local always. 
[01:36:30]  We are so late, Dice.  We got to take a break.  Well,  I just,  like I said,  I want to call in.  I want to tell you  everything will work out for you.  Thank you, Dice.  And you gave me  a lot of incentive  and I'm going to put  this album out now.  Do that.  And when you do,  you got to get over here  and come on the show live.  We'll have fun.  I need a good title  for the album.  So maybe you guys  can help out with that.  I'm over here now.  Jerk off face.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Wait a minute.  I'm over here now.  What do you mean  you're over there? 
[01:37:00]  Jerk off face.  I'm over here now.  Call it Jerk off face.  Maybe I'm over here now.  You think that's a good name for it?  I'm over here now.  Yeah,  good for you.  Good for you.  You came up with a name  in two seconds.  And banana juice.  So if I call it  I'm over here now,  I got to give you  a special thanks?  No.  Well,  yeah,  a nice thank you  on the inside  to be nice.  What would I write  to you like?  I don't know.  Something like...  You don't know.  That is the problem.  That's why your life  is in turmoil right now.  You're absolutely right. 
[01:37:30]  What can I say?  I want to help you  and all of a sudden  you're like  naming my album?  I name my album.  Nah, nah.  Nah, nah.  I'm over here  and you're going to  tell me what to do.  I'm the legend.  I'm the body.  Now I feel regretful  that I even made  this heartfelt call.  Wake up, Dice.  You know what I mean?  All right, look.  Call it I'm crazy  over here now.  I'm going to go.  You're over there now.  I'm over here  because everybody said what? 
[01:38:00]  Thank you.  All right, Dice.  That's what everybody says.  All right?  I'll talk to you later.  Keep in touch, man.  All right.  There he goes.  Andrew Dice, play.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Psycho.  Don't ever underestimate  the psycho factor  in my head.  Are you mental?  No!  It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like  a stalk-raving mad person.  No!  I'm getting hit!  No!  No! 
[01:38:30]  Don't ever underestimate  the psycho factor  in my head.  No!  No!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony,  Jim Brewer,  Adam Farrar  in the studio.  212-757-1027.  Yeah.  Simone from Jersey writes,  Hey guys,  I want to send an FU  to my bitch boss.  She told me the shirt  I was wearing today  was a little too revealing.  Wow.  She says I'm violating  the dress code.  I guess she's mad  because I'm a 34D  and she's a 34 board. 
[01:39:00]  Whoa.  Wow.  Mmm.  That happens  in the workplace.  A little pissed off.  She's a dancer.  Yeah, right?  She could get away  with it there.  In the strip club.  All right.  Jim, are you on  like crystal meth  or something?  Yeah, man.  Look at you.  Perpetually.  Hey, what's up, dude?  I don't play.  I'm off with the times,  Hammer.  Yeah.  Nice head, Opie.  Well, you are nothing.  Thank you.  Come on. 
[01:39:30]  Thank you, Benadryl boy.  Don't you hate guys  when they go,  they go,  hey, man,  what do you want?  And you go,  I'm on a natural high.  Come here, dick.  What is a natural high?  Pop, you snot.  I'm high on life.  Nice head.  Nice head.  And I was paying  for my drugs.  All right.  I saw Jim Brewer  on Comics Come Home  a couple of weeks ago  and he was freaking 
[01:40:00]  hysterical.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Can he do some  Joe Pesci for us?  God, do you get requests  for Pesci like  at bars and stuff?  They come up,  I tell you, man,  they come up drunk.  Yeah.  Hey, dude,  this is the guy, man.  You are the sheep.  Ever, man.  Dude, do it.  Tell me here,  the sheep.  You do it  for millions of people,  man?  You can't do  with sheep now? 
[01:40:30]  Hey, what did Pesci say?  Oh, is that messed up?  What's it like  working with the black dudes?  Chappelle,  is he like,  he's crazy, right?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, it's all crazy.  Yeah, do Pesci,  you faggot.  You're a faggot, right?  They say mad,  but that's because  you're a faggot.  Anyone who does Pesci  is a faggot.  But the second  you say anything to him, 
[01:41:00]  all of a sudden,  you're the a-hole.  You're the guy that,  I met that guy  and he was an a-hole.  Dude, you want to  step up?  You want to step up?  Tell you what,  dick, okay?  I play softball  on Saturdays,  Sundays.  Dude, I'll wipe you out.  I play center field,  a-hole.  Step outside.  What, you want to play  this week's show of manhood?  There's always his girlfriend 
[01:41:30]  next to him.  You know, he's not kidding.  He's got to  f*** this pig.  Really?  He's got to  f*** this pig.  You know,  we used to like you.  Yeah, you're the a-hole.  Oh, man.  We had some guy  at Sgt. Pepper's  like a couple of weeks ago  out on Long Island.  A guy that was licking  Anthony while he was  trying to sing on stage.  Occasionally,  occasionally I like  getting together  with my brother.  This guy was out of his mind.  Bill Brady, 
[01:42:00]  Joe Curry,  an occasional bass player.  And we do cover tunes.  A couple of local bars  on Long Island.  It's a lot of fun.  Drink beer.  Nothing serious.  Just having a lot of fun.  And some of the listeners  came down and stuff.  And 99.9999% of them,  fine.  Great.  Had a great time.  There's always one  mother f***er.  This guy,  the second we walked in,  he's like on me.  Hey, dude, man.  You know,  take a picture with me, man. 
[01:42:30]  Which is fine, you know.  Starts off real good.  Oh, he starts off real good.  Give me your hat.  Give me your hat.  Dude, I'll change it.  I'll change you my hat.  His hat looked like  the hat like Quint was wearing  or Jaws.  It probably smelled the same.  Little brown eel  comes out of the cage.  And he had like  three teeth in his head.  And now I'm his powerful life.  Yeah.  The whole time I'm there,  I'm his pal.  So we're playing.  He gets up like  right next to me  as I'm trying to sing  and tries to lick my ear. 
[01:43:00]  I'm like,  dude,  get the f*** away from me.  That same guy  came up to me  and he was just hammered  and his friend comes up to me  and goes,  oh, watch out for that guy.  When he drinks,  he gets gay.  He gets gay.  Oh my God.  Is there such thing  as being gay when you drink?  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you drinking?  Yeah.  Cosmopolitan.  And then the same guy  followed me out of the place  and, you know,  he's like a huge fan, man.  Huge fan.  Just like Ann said,  he goes,  can I have your hat?  I'm like,  dude,  it's my only hat. 
[01:43:30]  I love this hat.  And I wouldn't give it to him,  right?  So he goes,  you suck, man.  I'm going to start listening  to Libla instead.  You're an ass.  You should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  Oh, God.  King of college.  Oh, man.  Talk to my brother.  He's in the hospital  with cancer.  Jerry, please.  No, I'm very busy.  I'm on my way to stuff.  Jerry, please.  Just two words.  I'm really busy.  I got to go.  You should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  Are you probably going bald,  faggot?  That's your problem,  faggot.  Faggot. 
[01:44:00]  No hair on your head.  Where are you from,  picking Suffolk?  That's an insane mass song.  At least you don't have  to take responsibility.  You know what?  Olive Garden food sucks.  Yeah, Mr. Hospitaliano.  Like, I'm cooking the crap.  You cashed the check now.  Yeah.  You're responsible.  That's it.  Hey, we have a witness.  We have a witness  to the ear licking.  Mike.  I was at Sergeant Pepper's  last week,  a couple weeks ago,  and he said it.  That guy looked like  Sloth from the Goonies.  He gets up in front  of the microphone  and he's like,  hey, man, do this, 
[01:44:30]  do that.  Yeah.  It was all messed up  in the head.  And then the second  you, like, sort of go,  look, dude,  I'm doing a gig here.  I'm trying to, you know,  do something.  I really need a couple  of minutes over here.  What an a-hole, man.  You're such a...  You know, the guy  wouldn't say boo to me.  I tell him what a big fan I am.  of the show  and he told me  to F off.  You know, that's how  the story gets translated  to his drunken pals  and stuff.  Next on News Channel 4,  Anthony goes crazy. 
[01:45:00]  He goes postal  on a huge fan.  Yeah, man,  it happens real quick.  Yeah.  Oh, the story  always gets changed.  You know,  he tried to give me  his hat  and I said no.  I don't want  your hat, man.  I made the mistake  of, like,  because right when  I walked in,  he was like,  let me get you  a beer, man.  Like, oh, okay, cool.  Gave me a beer  and that's it.  It's just like a chick.  What it is  is that when fans,  fans,  when they're into you,  it's just like  when you used  to go out  in the bars  and you're 
[01:45:30]  the chick now.  He buys you a drink  and now I've got  to go home  and do whatever  the chick wants  all night.  I've got to spread them.  I bought you a drink,  man.  Help me paint  my basement.  Do Joe Pesci,  bat like a goat  and paint  my basement.  I get it.  Three Budweiser.  Bend over the table,  I'm going to rail you.  What's the problem?  You ain't Long Island,  faggot.  You drank my beer,  though,  didn't you?  Yeah.  You drank my beer.  I see what you're  all about, man.  I know what I used  to do to chicks. 
[01:46:00]  What a dick.  I bought you beer.  Suck it.  Come on,  the man's  on the back.  Good Lord.  Tracy Odo does it.  She just turned 18.  What's the big thing?  Oh, whatever, dude.  Faggot.  I bought her a drink,  too.  It wasn't even a beer.  I ain't paying for that.  All right,  Mr. Brewer,  you want me to take  the paint back?  No,  I'll find someone  to help me. 
[01:46:30]  Do you understand  I used to work  at TGI Fridays,  too?  Is it that?  Get out.  Were you the guy  with the little badges  on your earth?  I wouldn't,  you know,  because they...  Wow,  what a rebel.  You wouldn't wear  the badges.  I'm not wearing  the badges, man.  I wouldn't wear a hat.  I'll wear the suspenders.  Screw you, man.  I'm my own person.  I'm not wearing  the flare. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, man.  Once I felt  really degraded there,  I felt like  I had to get him back,  so this is a true  story.  I'm leaving  and this other guy  was a big stoner,  this guy, Joe.  Joe, if you're out  there, man, dude,  you've got to call  and back me up here.  He comes out.  He was like,  one day,  we're just sitting  in our back  and he goes,  dude, why can't  we all just  hang out in life?  So he's one of these dudes,  so we go out  and we're leaving  for the day  and the ice cream truck 
[01:47:30]  was delivering  and he's like,  yo, let's take  one of the ice cream bins.  I'm like,  nah, nah.  He quick grabbed  the bin  and then I grabbed  the bin.  I shoved it in my car,  I drove it home,  but their ice cream bins  are like huge  garbage barrels.  Full of ice cream?  Yeah, so now  I got it home  in Valley Stream  like 20 minutes later,  it's melted  and I can't shove it  in any of my freezers.  I went to my sister's house  and she's like,  let me get some Tupperware.  We had like 40 things  of Tupperware ice cream. 
[01:48:00]  What a bunch of jackasses.  You must have been  stoned.  That's scary.  That's scary.  I was.  I was like 19.  I'm like,  I am stealing ice cream.  I'm making a statement again.  Take that, TGI.  Friday.  Make me wear  a button to baggots.  What is up?  I'm leaving  my Jesus Priest jacket.  And I'm coming back  for the moose's head.  Wild man.  That is funny.  Yeah, but they make you  train for two weeks. 
[01:48:30]  For what?  You have to learn like,  oh man,  it was so annoying.  You've got to go  into TJ for,  and there's always one guy  that's been out  about seven years.  He's going to tell you.  Philadelphia, Atlanta,  and everyone in sales.  Whatever, dick.  Tell me about the citizen.  Can you believe this guy?  He's the 98 buttons.  He's the 98 button guy.  I got this one  when I was working,  when I was camping  in Alaska.  Oh, what?  It's like his whole life, man. 
[01:49:00]  I started out  as a busboy.  Nice head.  This guy, man.  Oh, shoot.  The red stripes  were my idea.  So what the hell  they teaching you?  You're going to learn  the menu.  You have to take  a test on the menu.  A test?  Yes, you have to take  all right,  what's in a fajita?  Guacamole.  And chicken.  And sometimes,  oh man,  steak.  Very good,  Mr. Brewer.  Don't call me  Mr. Brewer. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, you faggot.  I'm 19, man.  So I sat there,  so my first day,  and you have to learn  drinks.  Like,  I still don't know  to this day,  certain drinks  are called like...  Blue Hawaiian?  No, you can't call it  like that.  You've got to go,  I'll have a high ball  to the third power.  That means they've got  to use the blender.  Oh, you've got to  order the drinks  in code.  Yes, you have to  order the drinks,  and you have to 
[01:50:00]  get the glasses.  Right.  Right, and you have  to get the...  Now, I'm in line  with these people.  It's busy now.  There's 50...  There's only six people  in my whole area,  but I'm stressing hard.  Just bring our drinks,  and we want mozzarella sticks.  Oh, man.  Nothing more stressful  than the food service industry.  Soup, bro.  And all I do  is one jacket  is to go,  I'll have a blue nipple  and get my hair  and hold the ice  and throw in some bourbon. 
[01:50:30]  Screw me.  I am humped hard.  And they're in line  with all these serious people.  And they're all like going,  beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,  I'll have a blue high ball  to the seventh power.  Okay, next.  I'll have...  Um, what do I use?  Get me in line, a-hole,  until you learn  how to call the drinks  on yourself.  Here's the thing.  I'm going to go study.  And that's what they used  to make me do.  And I,  oh, someone would take  a table of mine,  like, oh,  you should have learned  when you pass the test  maybe if you didn't...  Oh, they suck. 
[01:51:00]  Needless to say,  it lasted like two weeks  after I stole the ice cream.  Like, oh, I'm out of here.  I'm going to throw in a jail  for the ice cream.  That's like high pressure,  though,  the food service industry.  Because, you know,  around lunchtime  and dinnertime,  it never stops.  And you can't just...  I like a job  where at any given moment,  if you're pissed off  or something,  you can just sit down  and take a breath.  But what are you going to do?  There's people screaming  for stuff that...  Oh, it's disgusting. 
[01:51:30]  Listen, I know you're hungry.  I need to chill  because you guys  are really pissing me off, man.  My throat is all annoyed.  I'm going to learn  these faggot tricks.  I don't know what just making.  Jerk, you know what I want?  I'm going to call  CP3 Power.  Everybody's getting the fish.  It should be like an airplane.  You get two choices.  And that's the thing.  Why would you go TGI Fridays  and order anything  but like a fajita  or a burger?  Right, right.  I'll have the sea bass. 
[01:52:00]  Well, then you're an A-hole.  What are you doing here?  There's a great  seafood place up the road.  Trash night out.  All right.  You're all decked out  to get some sea bass.  You idiot.  There's a nice  like seafood restaurant  you can go to.  There's that, no.  There's so many people  checking in  that worked at Fridays.  Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.  No, I'm not, man.  Well, let's see  what they're going to say here.  Scott, what's going on?  What's up, man?  I used to work  at TGI Friday. 
[01:52:30]  What a pain-in-the-ass  place to work.  Was it?  What?  You had to take  20 tests  to make a burger.  Yes.  Two tests.  Yes, you had tests.  Remember, how many tests  did you have to pass  the bar test?  The bar test.  I had to run around  the building  in the first two weeks  and sing back to the house.  What?  Because they were competing  with the servers  and the bartenders  and the people  that were cooking.  Yep.  Totally ridiculous.  Happy birthday to you.  Come on.  Do you have to do that?  No.  Did you have to do that? 
[01:53:00]  Tell me you failed that test.  Oh, I definitely had to learn,  but yo, they hated me.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, no.  I was always just going,  yeah,  and looking around  the other room.  Look at the breast  on that horse.  It was just a thing.  Never mind,  I'll get her rolls.  Play on the burger.  Have some rolls anyway.  So are you around here  from Massapequa?  They're all at the other table.  Happy birthday. 
[01:53:30]  I always disappear.  I'm making some ice cream, man.  You're the guy  in the back of the crowd.  Because that always just looks  like the most degrading.  Why would you have  your employees do that?  Does anyone really enjoy that  when they're sitting down?  Because it's never  the person's birthday  that's having the birthday's idea  to have that done.  It's like,  hey,  when they go to the bathroom,  we'll call the waiter over  and say it's their birthday  and they'll send over  the little cupcake  with the candle  and the whole cast of a-holes  will come out and say, 
[01:54:00]  happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  And the guy sits there going,  oh, you bunch of motherfuckers.  Now I got to sit there  and look like an idiot.  My favorite is the guy  from the kitchen  with the accent,  happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  I like the heat of good day.  I make it.  I make it with my feet.  That's, to me,  especially like you get  the guys and girls in there  that they just want  to do a job,  get their money,  get the hell out of there.  And they,  I think it's equal  to a secretary in an office 
[01:54:30]  and the boss going,  hey, why don't you  hike that skirt up  a little bit, honey?  I think it's just  as degrading.  They're there to serve food  and do that  and they got to sing  goofy songs to people.  However,  it is hilarious  when,  when you're a hammer  and you bring like that  one guy who knows  he'll go to blows  if these bananas come over.  You know,  you're done like,  yeah,  they're gathering  with the balloons  over there.  Act cool, act cool. 
[01:55:00]  Make believe  you don't see them.  All right,  Dicks,  who did this?  Oh, man,  I did.  Happy birthday  to you.  He's just sitting here  like,  I'm going to bust  him.  I'm going to kill you.  This ain't funny.  Go away, please.  Go away, please.  Oh,  that's a candle.  Was that one place  that they take out  the moose?  A big moose.  No,  that was up in Boston.  And you had to kiss  the moose.  Kiss the moose  on your birthday.  What?  I think it was like  the Outback  or something like that.  One of those places.  And it's like,  now kiss the moose. 
[01:55:30]  Like,  I'm going to stick  my stuff in the moose's face  in a minute  if you don't pull  that goddamn thing  away from me.  I'm going to get  a moose job.  That's when you're drunk,  friend.  Remember this old one?  Remember when you  pull out your little  kiss the moose?  You pull out your pocket.  You want to kiss a bunny?  Who wants to touch  the elephant's trunk?  Touch the elephant's trunk?  You pull your pocket.  You pull your pocket.  You want to see  every kiss a bunny?  No. 
[01:56:00]  Hey,  here you go.  Oh,  you suck.  What an idiot.  Oh,  man.  Okay.  Hey.  Okay.  Oh,  boy.  You guys have,  you guys have,  you guys have  redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville  show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  Instant,  instant feedback  coming in like crazy.  Frank from Manhattan. 
[01:56:30]  ONA,  this morning,  I took the cab to work  and it drove down  Fifth Avenue.  All the news vans  were lined up  on either side  of the street  and I had to laugh  because all the anchors  were standing  on the top  of the vans.  Gee,  I can't imagine  what they were afraid of.  You know,  every head of  every news department  gave their crew  some serious  marching orders.  If I see a goddamn  wow sign on our air  during the Cardinal's funeral,  you better jump  in the grave after him  because that's the only  place you'll be safe.  Huh.  It was great. 
[01:57:00]  They don't make a move  without thinking of  the wow ambush.  Syndication underground.  Frank,  I think I saw a wow sticker.  Someone slapped it  on the Cardinal's casket  as they were carrying it  out of the cathedral.  Yikes.  We haven't had  wow on live TV lately.  I think they're on  to us a little bit.  They're a little smarter.  Yeah.  It's going to be  a little harder to get them  but they'll let their guard down.  They always do.  Let's let them rip, man.  They always do.  All right,  let's go back  to the phones here.  Garrow?  Yeah, 
[01:57:30]  what's up, guys?  How are you, Garrow?  Good, good.  Just graduated  from C Hall this morning.  Oh, congratulations.  Yeah,  we had our  commencement speaker  was the one and only  Tom Brokenjaw.  No.  Oh, really?  Yeah,  it was horrible.  First 10 minutes  were so-so.  He started to talk  about a couple things  but just went on  forever and ever and ever.  Did he have any sense  of humor?  from the seats.  Did he try to joke  or anything?  Yeah,  he did.  He tried a couple things  but we were just  like so out of it.  We were so turned  off to him right away.  Always good to start  with a little joke. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah,  it was like he,  you could see him  he was like yawning  on the podium  and stuff  before he came out.  We were just like,  screw you,  leave, bro.  We just want you to,  we want you to,  John.  He's the sleepiest guy  ever.  Ever,  ever.  Did he have something  to do with the school  or did they just  like grab him?  He got an honorary degree.  Well,  they all do.  Honorary degree.  Why,  why give it to this guy?  Tom Brokaw,  MBT not one news  here at Seton Hall.  I just want to tell  all the students  to stick with your studies 
[01:58:30]  and what you're doing  and you could someday  be like me.  Tom Brokaw.  Tom?  Yeah,  yeah.  It's a big day for you.  Yeah.  You're doing the graduation speech  but you,  yeah.  You seem really,  really out of it today.  Well,  I was covering the  death of the cardinal.  Oh,  you were?  Many hours before the speech.  It sounds like you might have been  at a frat house  last night  and stayed up too late  doing like cake stands  or something.  Well,  you're on to me.  I was at one of the many 
[01:59:00]  frat houses around  Seton Hall  University  and I was  doing some  cake stands  Yeah.  with some of the students  Yeah.  and,  of course,  there was some  drunken co-ed  we like to call  free meat  when they pass out  and the  boys in the  fraternity  were kind enough  to let  Tom Brokaw  get the first dibs  on her.  Tom?  Yeah.  Besides sounding really 
[01:59:30]  drowsy  there's writing all over  your forehead  and stuff.  All those little  sons of bitches.  What's that all about?  Well,  I fell asleep  after I banged  the co-ed  Actually,  it wasn't a co-ed  it was our own  Katie Couric  who was passed out  getting nailed  by line after line  of frat brothers.  Yeah.  Quite the scene.  Yeah,  but you're not  explaining the writing  on your  Yes.  I fell asleep  and I guess  some of the  little hooligans  wrote on my forehead.  What does it say? 
[02:00:00]  Give me a mirror.  Wait a minute.  Yeah,  you better look  in the mirror  because I can't  even repeat it  on the air.  Let me see.  Yag  What does that mean?  You're reading it  backwards.  It says  Tom is gay.  Tom is gay?  Yes,  that's what it says.  That's no wonder 
[02:00:30]  I was getting  funny looks  at the diner  when we all went  to a little breakfast  after the hot.  You should have  seen Katie Couric  quite the sperm  bank  when everyone  was done  with her  just line  after line  of students  and of course  all of them  listened to the  Opie and Anthony  show  because after  they finished up  each and every  one said  look what I did  to you  again.  Tom Brogan  party hardy 
[02:01:00]  here at Seton Hall  many bong hits  last night  Opie.  Yeah?  Many bong hits  and then  of course  Katie  her butt  up in the air  getting slapped  with many  a yam bag.  Fascinating.  I don't know  how she was able  to sit  on the news  program this morning.  Yeah.  Well it looks like  you had a great time  at Seton Hall.  Lots of fun  at Seton Hall  I'd like to thank  everybody 
[02:01:30]  especially the  whores.  Tom Brogan  NBC  Nightly News.  We were on a little  panty raid  after that Opie.  Oh yeah?  A little panty raid.  I got my  my wick wet  once again.  Yeah well  you got like a wet  spot in the front  of your pants  there.  I don't know  what that's about  but.  I was going  all night.  You should have  seen me at the  rave later on  doing some X.  I was all  almost coherent. 
[02:02:00]  You were doing  some X huh?  I don't know  what I got  NBC.  Nightly News.  Okay.  Well thanks Tom.  Tom?  I think you  crashed out  finally.  What a partier.  Commencement  speeches.  Tom Brokaw.  An honorary  degree.  I hate that.  They get the  honorary degrees.  Bill Cosby's got  like 20 of them.  I can't even get  an honorary degree  from my high school.  Bunch of  bastards.  I heard Rick  on the phone  once.  What?  No he just 
[02:02:30]  wants an honorary  diploma.  Just an honorary  high school diploma  from John Glenn.  He was talking  to your old  high school?  Yeah and  they're just  like no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Bastards.  Come on man.  You've made  something of your  life.  I'm the pride  of John Glenn  you mother  effers.  Let me in.  Those hallowed  halls.  You're the most  famous person to  come out of  John Glenn I  think.  I think so.  You'd have been  the most famous  out of Harbourfields  if it wasn't for  Mariah Carey.  Mariah Carey.  There's a big 
[02:03:00]  difference right  there too.  But John Glenn  out there in  Elwood.  It's like it  couldn't have  been a guy  that has like  a small part  in NYPD  blue that went  to my high  school.  No it's  Mariah Carey.  I can't think  of one person  that came out  of John Glenn  High School.  That's not a  one.  That's even  because I don't  even consider  myself famous.  You know I  have a bit of  recognition here  in New York.  Great.  But I mean  the other people  in John Glenn  have I mean  I've never  heard of  anybody that  even comes  that close  to John Glenn. 
[02:03:30]  Not like a  Mariah Carey  like your  Harbourfields  where she goes  back to her  school to  perform.  You know I  made the call.  She gave  something back  Opie.  What are you  doing?  I made a call  to Harbourfields  High School.  Did you?  I want to go  back and they  didn't want anything  to do with me  or you for that  matter.  Yeah what the  hell is wrong  with them?  I think I'm  like half a  credit short  because I  didn't climb  the rope  enough in  gym class  and they  didn't give  me my  diploma.  So I  had to go  through life  with the  scarlet letter 
[02:04:00]  of no  diploma Opie  a high school  dropout.  But you are  an expert.  At what?  Air conditioning.  Yeah see?  Yeah I did.  See I went  on.  I got no I  don't have no  good enough  diploma.  What was I  going to get  a GED for?  Let me tell  you people.  Those are the  dumbest friggin things  you ever want  to get in  your life.  If you didn't  make it through  high school  and get your  diploma just  write it off.  Who cares?  You think an  employee is going  to go oh you  dropped down  high school.  Oh but you  got the GED.  That's great. 
[02:04:30]  The great hard  questions on the  GED.  How to balance  a checkbook.  Oh that's that  tough thing called  subtraction.  Oh the good  enough diploma.  Yeah like Chris  Rock said.  GED good enough  diploma.  Now I could go  to college.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Now I got my  GED.  Now I could go  to college.  Someone was  saying didn't  Boomer go to  John Gladden.  No he didn't.  Boomer went to  my elementary  school.  Timber Point  Elementary School  but I never  went to the  high school over 
[02:05:00]  there in East  Islip.  I was moving  around like  we were like  friggin nomads  when I was a  kid.  We were all  over Long  Island.  East Islip.  Central Islip.  Huntington.  Why did you  move around so  much?  I don't know.  Papa's having  a hard time  keeping a house.  It was a  little rough.  It's like hey  dad.  What's the  matter?  No job again  this week?  Jeez.  But he was a  high school  fan.  He had a  diploma.  One week he  was fixing 
[02:05:30]  vending machines.  Next week he's  like a private  investigator.  The week after  that I don't  know what he's  doing.  He owns one of  the snack carts  on the LIA.  I don't know  what it was.  But we were  moving every  year.  Every year.  It was like  pack the crap  up again.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Get the U-Haul.  And it was  never long moves.  It was like  alright now we're  moving from  Central Islip to  East Islip.  Oh good.  That's good.  Nice 10 minute  move but we  got to pick  everything up.  Move everything.  So a year later  we're moving  again.  Back to  Huntington. 
[02:06:00]  I moved  back to  Huntington.  I went to  kindergarten at a  school called  Cuba Hill  Elementary School.  I know where  that is.  Sure.  Then in  6th grade  after this  journey around  Long Island  we came back  and I was  back in  kindergarten.  I never  went one  grade up.  Back into  Cuba Hill  Elementary School  in 6th grade  and I knew  everybody but  they didn't  know me.  I came in  and I was  like I know  that guy.  I know her.  I know him.  And they didn't  know me so I was  walking up to 
[02:06:30]  people and just  going hey how  you doing.  Yeah.  Who are you?  I was like oh  wow nice.  You're growing  boobies.  Isn't that nice?  But we were  moving all the  time.  Yeah so I  why can't I  get my diploma?  I'll go there.  I'll take a  class.  I'll go to  gym.  I'll do some  sit ups.  It'll be a  laugh.  And you slap  me with my  sheepskin for  God's sake.  Rick tried.  I'll go up in  the field and  give a little  speech.  I'll give the  speech.  Was it just  gym you  failed?  No.  Okay.  Might have  been a couple  other things. 
[02:07:00]  Maybe social  studies.  Social studies?  No I don't  know what it  was.  It was because  I didn't show  up to a lot  of classes.  They were like  major league  boring.  They were  getting in  your way.  In the way  of my  podcast.  What?  The principal  knew who  you were.  Of course  they know.  I was in  there every  day.  I had  problems.  He knows  exactly who  you are but  they don't do  that.  How come  they don't do  that?  There's no  law.  There's no  rule.  It's an honorary  degree. 
[02:07:30]  It's not like  you can do  something with  it.  Yeah.  What am I  going to go  with some  job and go  hey I'd  like to  apply.  Here's my  diploma.  You know.  Any other  job I had I  used my  school that I  went to out in  California.  I would just  write it down.  It's like high  school.  Okay Dana  Hills High  School out in  California.  What are they  on the phone?  Hello Dana  Hills?  I need  confirmation that  Anthony actually  went there.  I got a  college degree  and they  never asked  me.  Has one  person ever  asked you  for your  degree or 
[02:08:00]  diploma or  anything?  No.  For a job?  They never  asked for the  high school  diploma or the  college diploma?  Especially like a  dopey ass job  like this.  I had regular  jobs and stuff  throughout my  radio career.  They never  asked.  And some of the  jobs I was a  computer programmer  for a while.  They never  asked me about  my college  education.  They just  assumed because  I was applying  for the job.  I went into  the wonderful  world of an  air conditioning  installation and  no one asked  me for a 
[02:08:30]  diploma.  You bring in  your diploma.  But god damn  it John Glenn  what's your  problem?  Stupid school.  The astronaut  wouldn't even go  there.  You know they  tried to get  John Glenn the  astronaut to  say hi to the  people.  Named the school  after him and  even John Glenn  said no.  John Glenn  wouldn't go  there.  They try every  year to get  that son of a  bitch over  there.  He flew into  space he won't  go to Elwood.  They should  change the name  of the school  then.  They should. 
[02:09:00]  John Glenn's  dissing the  people over  there.  Totally  diss them.  I'll travel like  a few million  miles but I  won't go to  John Glenn  High School.  Stupid.  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  It's like  listening to  Corky and  Karen Quinlan.  Opie and  Anthony.  I'd rather  hear my  penis in a  voice than  listen to  those  jokes.  The Opie  and Anthony  Show.  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  The Night is  part of this  time.  Everything is  dirty.  Blast for me. 
[02:09:30]  My hands are  running and  cold.  The air is  standing straight  up.  This is just  the way I  face to  me.  I can't  control my  sight.  I can't hear  something about  this.  suffering run.  I wish I  did it like  this.  Is it a  dream or  I'm not  my way.  I felt the  air rise  laughing.  In the  air  clear the  sun I'm  in.  I want to  write what you  can see.  Inside the  shadow  waits and  breathe.  All right 
[02:10:00]  I guess  it's time  for Spaz's  idea.  Yeah.  So let's  bring in  Spaz now.  Let's bring  in Spaz.  You know  when doing  this show  we love to  get new  ideas for  new things  to do  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show.  And we'll  take the 
[02:10:30]  ideas from  anyone.  Listeners,  each other,  the people that  work here,  and of course  the interns.  If they come  up with a  good idea  who are we  to say it's  not a good  idea?  We don't  care where  the ideas  come from.  Right.  It is the  people's radio  show.  I'll go on  record and say  we get most  of our really  good ideas  from our  listeners.  From the  listeners.  Absolutely.  Get a lot  of the funny  lines from  our listeners.  And we  rip you guys  off all the  time.  Yep.  It comes up  on the  instant feedback.  If it's funny,  we're using it.  We're using it  and not giving  you credit.  Me and Opie  fight over  your stuff 
[02:11:00]  sometimes.  Oh no,  come on.  Look at Bob  from Jersey's  got a great  line.  It's mine.  We try to  give you guys  credit.  It's so funny  though if we  don't, you  guys are right  on top of it.  Yeah, and then  they write back  on the instant  feedback, that  was mine.  You ripped me  off.  You ripped me  off.  That's why you  wrote it, so it  would make the air.  Shut up.  All right, so we  got another idea  from Spaz.  Now, usually  you would think  somebody would  have an idea  and just kind  of walk up to  you and go,  hey, I got an  idea.  Right.  And tell you  the idea.  Right.  And you'd go,  yeah, that's  cool, or maybe  not. 
[02:11:30]  Spaz presents  these ideas all  printed out on  the computer like  an outline.  It's presented  like somebody  would present an  idea for IBM  or something.  And we  appreciate the  effort.  We do?  Oh, we do.  Yeah, I didn't  realize he knew  how to type,  but you do,  Spaz.  Any formats  at all out?  What was the  last idea you  gave us?  I can't  remember.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Neither can  wait.  Tell you the  truth.  All right, so  Spaz, your  latest idea for  the O&A show  is the porno  casting call.  Yes.  Don't say  anything.  We'll tell you  when to speak.  Please.  You did a  one sheet for  us to explain  exactly the  concept, the  film, bonuses.  He's got little  subjects and  everything in it.  Yeah.  Little headlines.  It's like an  outline.  So it's Spaz's  porno casting 
[02:12:30]  call.  Yes.  Now he presents  these things  too, hoping,  hoping they make  their way to  like Jeremy,  and they're very  nicely printed out  and stuff.  And I think he  has this whole  image in his  head that Jeremy  will read it,  Ken Stevens will  read it, and  Spaz will be  accepted as an  idea man.  Spaz, you're  lucky that the  bosses didn't get  a copy of this.  Yeah.  Spaz, I gotta  say, after  reading this, I  had to read  through this twice.  I swear to you, 
[02:13:00]  Rick saw it in the  office.  And it was  dumbfounded.  I had to read  through this twice  to maybe see if  there was a  punchline to it  or just to  grasp it in my  head.  This could  possibly be the  most ridiculous,  insane idea I've  ever, ever read  to be presented on  this program.  Do you truly think  this is a good idea  for the show?  I just need to  know.  I know this is a  lot of work involved.  No, no, not work  involved.  We don't care if we  have to build a  spaceship and fly to 
[02:13:30]  Venus for a good  idea.  I mean, we'll  try it.  Yeah, we'll go the  distance for a good  idea.  It has nothing to  do with work  involved.  Is this worth a  lot of effort?  I believe so.  Okay.  You see nothing  wrong with this?  So you handed  this in and you  were all excited,  right?  It's right up your  alley.  But you were all  excited, right?  You're like, I can't  wait for them to  read it.  They're going to go  for it.  This is perfect,  right?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm  trying to get  inside your head.  And he thinks it's  right up our alley.  Like, this is the  kind of stuff we  should be doing  on this program.  All right.  Well, let me read a  little bit of this 
[02:14:00]  ad.  And we'll stop as  we move along here,  okay?  Spaz's O&A show  idea.  Porno casting call.  The concept,  Anthony.  Yeah.  Do an open casting  call for women who  want to be in a  porno of all women  gotten from the  Opie and Anthony  show.  First of all, the  grammar there is  fantastic.  It's horrendous.  Do an open casting  call for women who  want to be in a  porno of all women  gotten from the  Opie and Anthony  show.  Now, what you're  trying to say here  is we open up the  phone lines and say, 
[02:14:30]  okay, girls, call up  now.  We are producing a  porno movie.  So we want, it's a  porno movie featuring  you, the girls that  listen to Opie and  Anthony.  Yes.  Okay.  Only women would be  allowed up into the  studio.  No men would be  allowed in because of  the number of people  expected.  So you're, you're  expecting a lot.  Huge turnout.  If we said we are  casting for a porno,  you're just convinced 
[02:15:00]  that there's going to  be just hundreds of  women showing up at  the station, right?  Yes, because I believe  that there are a lot of  girls out there who  want to do this but  just don't know how to  go about doing it.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And, and why no men?  Why?  Well, because, you know,  they would just be in  the way and everything.  Plus, you, you always  get upset whenever you  see men when you have  girls on a lesbian  count.  True.  Okay.  That is a true thing  right there.  Okay.  If the men are  interested in getting  into the film, send  their lady to be  evaluated, and if the  woman makes the cut, I 
[02:15:30]  will speak with the men  myself after the casting  call.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  What the hell does that  mean?  So you're going to be the  porno director, right?  Actually, it's...  You want to take this  idea on, so you would be  the porno director.  Yeah.  All right, so you want  to interview guys, girls.  Yes.  Girlfriends, right?  Yes.  So how do they get in  the film if their lady's  been evaluated and is  going to make the cut?  Well, like, they, you  know, walk-on scene or  something like that.  If they're interested in  getting into this line of  work, then we would  talk them off because they  wouldn't actually be 
[02:16:00]  naked in the studio.  Because we don't have  men naked.  Oh, my God.  So you will speak with  the men myself after the  casting call.  Now, see if they'll be  part of the film.  What would you speak to  them about?  I don't even get, like,  okay, a guy says, hey, I  want to be in the porno  movie.  And then, and you say,  well, let me see your  hot girlfriend, right?  And then you evaluate the  girlfriend.  Yes.  So then what are you  going to say to the guy  after the girl is, like,  makes the cut?  Though we might be able  to work you into a  walk-on part, we'll take 
[02:16:30]  a look at, you know, your  resume, I guess, and then  we'll get back to you.  Okay.  All right.  You know, we should give  Craig from Belmore a  prize today.  He remembered Spaz's  last idea.  Oh, what was it?  Remember, Ant, the eight-man  fight club between show  regulars?  Oh, right.  That was it.  And then Craig goes, what a  loser.  I will, uh, I will speak  with the men myself after  the casting call.  The women will be expected  to get naked, be evaluated, 
[02:17:00]  describe past sexual  experiences, answer  questions of a sexual  nature, and at the very  end, all interested women  that make the cut will  take part in a mass  lesbian for a day casting  couch audition.  Now, without getting into...  Are you working for the  WWF or something?  It's like some battle  royale with lesbians.  Without getting into any  details, uh, women  expecting to get naked  and be evaluated, describe  their past sexual  experiences, does that 
[02:17:30]  sound vaguely familiar of  another program that airs in  this city?  Vaguely, sure.  In the morning?  Don't you realize, like,  we like, we try to do  stuff that, uh, that is  different, so is it, and  even try, uh, harder than  usual, so as to avoid any  comparison?  Have you ever seen a  program where maybe a girl  gets up, takes her clothes  off, and is evaluated by the  members of this other  program?  And that's why I don't  think we've ever used the  word evaluate on film?  No, not on film, not on 
[02:18:00]  two TV shows.  No, no.  Jesus, Jesus H.  Christ.  All right.  All right.  To guarantee there will  definitely be some  action that day.  Well, this is, wait, back  up.  This is, yeah, this is  when they're doing the  Lesbian for a Day casting  couch audition.  Uh-huh.  And, no, they will be  taking part in a mass  Lesbian for a Day casting  couch audition.  How many, how many  lesbians are you going to  get on the couch at one  time?  I, I figure we can fit as  many as...  Thousands, Opie.  Well, on the couch,  around the couch, on the 
[02:18:30]  of the...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Okay.  Woo!  And then, as Ann said, to  guarantee that there will  definitely be some action  that day, I will supply some  ringers who will definitely  perform.  Spaz, where are you getting  ringers?  I know of a source to get  ringers.  Where's your source?  Anthony the limo driver,  right?  No, not him.  Who?  It's a friend of mine.  What's your source?  A friend of mine who...  Johnny Action?  No.  Johnny Action.  Johnny Action.  Who's your source? 
[02:19:00]  The Invisible Man?  The Invisible Man?  Earl's friend?  I have a source.  Yeah.  What's your friggin' source?  Do you...  My friend...  Don't you think we  wouldn't ask you, if we  actually considered this  idea for a nanosecond, we  wouldn't ask you what your  source is?  My source is a friend of  mine who's done a film  before.  Your friend Gary.  Let's just put it out.  Gary, who did the porno movie...  With me in it for 10 seconds.  And with you in it for 10  seconds.  Yes.  Where you were what?  Just a...  I was a cop.  You were a cop.  That's right. 
[02:19:30]  Spaz is like trying to be  Larry Flint.  So he'll supply some ringers.  Spaz is casting for Caligula 2.  The film itself will be shot  here in New York City.  Oh, good.  We won't have to fly off to  an exotic...  Whoa!  It's cursing!  I'm cursing.  We won't have to fly off to  an exotic location.  The film itself will be shot  here in New York.  It would be done in the  gonzo style, allowing for  more free-form, free-wheeling, 
[02:20:00]  anything-goes style, you  effing moron.  What the hell does that mean?  What is gonzo style?  It'd be like anything-goes.  What do you mean anything-goes?  That's what happens in every  porno.  It's just called porno.  It's not called gonzo porno.  It will be done in the gonzo.  I prefer making films in the  gonzo style, O.P.  You know, the Muppet Show  gonzo style.  And who's your influence?  Like, oh, the gonzo style. 
[02:20:30]  Are there people you respect  in the porno business that you  follow?  There are professionals, but  the thing is, like, usually  there are restrictions.  Like, it'd be like, uh,  anything, like, we can use,  like, tools, like, I don't  know, they can...  There are usually restrictions  on a different porno.  Okay, in this porno, we're not  going to use toys.  Pornos are like that, but  this would be open.  Like, whatever the girl  wants to do, she can do.  So what if a girl wants to  take a shovel and then slam  it on the back of the head  of another lesbian?  Well, no violence, of course.  I'm talking about sexual. 
[02:21:00]  A lot of sexual...  If they want to take one to the  cars and stick it up there.  How about bloodletting?  If that's what they're into?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  In the sexual nature, whatever's  erotic to them.  What is wrong with you?  All right, so, all right, so  you want to have an open  casting call for, uh, for...  Will it be called the Opie and  Anthony porno?  Will our names be associated  with this, or will it be the  spaz porno?  No, if you choose...  Do you have a name for this  film?  Not yet, but you guys could be  associated as much as you want to be.  Well, we all strive to be porn 
[02:21:30]  directors and producers.  That's really our goal here.  But you kind of do it anyway.  It's not like we get in trouble,  uh, for explaining too explicitly  genitalia or anything.  We'll just film a porno and put it  out there.  Yeah, we have, like, ten women  that listen to us.  We'll convince them to come in  here for this mass lesbian for a  day casting couch audition, and  then the girls are allowed to do  whatever the hell they want to  each other.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure the phones are going to  ring off the hook with  ladies that want to do this. 
[02:22:00]  Spaz is jerk diggler.  You never know.  Oh, my God.  Taylor, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I got a great idea for a contest.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, it's called the beat the  crap out of spaz contest.  I like it already.  Open the phone lines, and the  first 102 callers get to kick the  crap out of spaz.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Taylor.  Later, brother.  God damn.  You get people so freaking  pissed off.  Spaz, did you think this up on  your two and a half hour train  ride today? 
[02:22:30]  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Yeah, I'm just wondering, is  Spaz, like, going to go for the  retarded pizza boy delivery guy  in there?  Very good, Jason.  Very good.  God.  All right.  So, we got to move on.  This is just explaining the film.  So, you haven't really explained the  Gonzo style.  Pretty much anything goes is your  answer to that, right?  Yeah, pretty much everything goes.  All right.  So, the film itself would be shot  here in New York City.  It would be done in the Gonzo style,  allowing for a more free-form, 
[02:23:00]  free-wheeling, anything-goes style.  It will only star women gotten from  the casting call.  Gotten from the casting call.  There will be multiple scenes shot  with a variety of different things to  highlight each scene.  Right?  Yes.  Okay, and you explained some of  these different highlights of your  porno film, right?  Yes.  One of them being, both Opie and  Anthony are invited to come and  direct the scene, either together  or separately.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  We come down and direct a scene.  Yes. 
[02:23:30]  You lost your mind somewhere,  right?  No, you can direct the scene.  Is there going to be a thrilling  scene that I can direct where a  boyfriend gropes his girlfriend  before he goes on a two-hour  commute?  That's a fun, that'd be a fun  scene, huh?  Come on.  Are you insane?  We have a studio location where you  guys can go unseen by a moment.  Here's what happened.  All right, here's what happened.  Spaz and his porn friggin'  wannabe director got together for a  few too many beers, and Spaz decided 
[02:24:00]  that he's going to hook this guy up  with a way to sell his porno.  He's going to use Opie and Anthony  to sell this guy's smug.  No, that has nothing to do with it.  Of course it does.  Bull crap.  You're flattering us by saying we'll  direct a scene, so of course if we  direct a scene in a porno, you don't  think we're going to be talking about  like crazy on the air?  So Spaz is sitting there with his  buddy going, okay, how can I get,  oh, I'll entice Opie and Anthony to  say yes, but I'll invite them to  direct the scene.  They can't refuse that. 
[02:24:30]  I'm appalled that you would even  say that.  Are you, I'm appalled that you would  come up with this.  I think it was right up your alley,  a great idea, and you know, at least  I'm trying with ideas.  Just because I have the Spaz moniker,  it doesn't mean that every idea is  stupid.  A lot of these ideas could be good if  it's a true.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Are you kidding?  This idea?  I'm telling you, it's golden.  Tommy, what's up?  Golden!  Now it's golden!  Tommy, what's up?  What is his definition of gonzo?  Gonzo, wait, I got it. 
[02:25:00]  Gonzo style, it would be done in  the Gonzo style, allowing for a  more free-form, free-wheeling,  anything-goes style.  Spaz, can you name me one porno  that you know that is done in  Gonzo style?  I don't know.  I haven't spoken to the  directors.  Because you don't know what  Gonzo is.  Gonzo is amateur porn.  It has nothing to do with  free-wheeling anything.  Buttman.  You guys heard of Buttman,  right?  Yeah.  The adventures of Buttman.  Yeah, of course.  Gonzo.  That's Gonzo.  Gonzo.  So Gonzo basically means 
[02:25:30]  amateur.  Correct.  Okay.  So I guess Spaz could probably  do it, being that he is an  amateur.  Seymour Butts?  Gonzo?  Amateur.  Gonzo, right?  Oh, correct.  And the biggest...  Debbie Does Dallas?  What's that?  Debbie Does Dallas?  No, not Gonzo.  Not Gonzo, okay.  Tracy Lord's films?  Not Gonzo.  Not Gonzo, okay.  Now that we have that straight...  Very good.  Like we said, he doesn't know  what he's talking about.  Ah, the Baz is going to film it  in Bozo style. 
[02:26:00]  The Pam and Tommy Lee tape?  Gonzo.  Gonzo, definitely.  Okay, there you go.  Now we're understanding that  at least.  Thank you, Tommy.  All right, you got it.  Thanks.  All right, let's go to Glenn  real fast, then we've got to  move on with the idea because  he has just another proud day  in Iona College history.  Right here, right now.  Glenn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm looking for somebody to  back me in a new  Snuff's Baz film.  Yeah, that's my proposal.  Yeah.  I want to do a snuff film.  Yeah, Baz, if you would  help out, here's my proposal. 
[02:26:30]  We do an open casting call  to murderers that want to  come down here and blow your...  And Opie and I can be  invited in to direct the scene.  And, you know, I think I would  go for that one.  Fun.  So both Opie and Anthony  are invited to come and  direct the scene either  together or separately.  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  A spazoid mind trick.  ONA will direct the scene.  He's trying to do a Jedi  Minecraft on us.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  You want to direct the scene. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  These are not the porn stars  you're looking for.  All right.  Check this out.  More about the film, Anthony,  besides us directing.  Have one of the non-CBS  contracted people associated  with the show actually appear  and perform in a scene?  Example, Old Dirty.  He's dragging Old Dirty  into the porno.  If he wants to be in there.  Was Old Dirty in the meeting  with you and your  porn wannabe guy? 
[02:27:30]  He's been...  Old Dirty, get me in there.  Old Dirty, I'll hook you up  so you'll be able to get laid.  My buddy...  What's his name?  Gary.  My buddy Gary,  don't worry,  I'll get Opie and Anthony.  And CBS will finance  the whole thing.  CBS will finance porno.  It's great.  See, we're involved  with Viacom now,  so I'm going to get him  in all the blockbuster videos.  Military Mike  has a good point here.  Military Mike,  what's up?  Hey, what's going on  at ONA?  How are you?  Hey, Spaz,  I got a question for you.  Yeah? 
[02:28:00]  If I remember correctly,  the lawyers wouldn't let  these two guys put out a CD.  Yeah.  And they're going to let  them put out a porno.  Thank you, Mike.  We can't put out a CD  because it has some  questionable material on it.  How the hell are we going  to get a porno out there,  you idiot?  You don't have to be  in the credits.  You just direct the one scene.  Have a good one, guys.  Thank you, Mike.  You don't have to be  in the credits.  Spaz, this is a way  you're going to get  your friend Gary  to sell a porno  that he wants to make  that never even  entered our minds.  Oh, bull, come on.  Come on.  I'm appalled 
[02:28:30]  by that statement.  I think I'm taking it back.  I'm appalled  with this proposal.  I'm taking it back.  Taking it back.  Mike, what's up?  ONA.  Yeah.  Favor for it.  Who's closer to him  right now?  Anthony.  Anthony.  Kick him as hard  as a cannon to nuts  so there's no chance  of him ever breeding again.  No chance.  No chance at all.  What a frickin' dope.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  We obviously  exploit everything.  Exploit everything. 
[02:29:00]  Exploit everything.  I just want to find out  if you'd be physically  abusing any retarded  children on the show today.  You'll be an Anthony show.  We're your special show.  Don't go crazy.  Don't go crazy.  We're talking about Spaz's idea. 
[02:29:30]  He wants to have  a porno casting call  and he wants basically  an opening Anthony porno  but he's not saying that.  But Spaz would be the director.  Okay, more about the film.  Have some of the sexual positions  discussed on the show 
[02:30:00]  performed in the film.  Example, the rusty trombone,  the wheelbarrow.  So the girls  that come in  for the open casting call  will be doing  the rusty trombone  on the likes of Old Dirty.  Not in the studio  but in the disclosed location.  At what?  Undisclosed location.  Not disclosed location.  Undisclosed, I'm sorry.  At what?  At the guy  who's filming it.  Oh, at Gary's studio.  It's a studio.  Well, it's not his studio.  It's someone else's studio.  Someone else who? 
[02:30:30]  You don't know him.  But you do?  Yeah.  And was he at this meeting too?  Has he been contacted?  Have all the principals  that you mention in this  aside from, you know,  porn star, Old Dirty  been contacted?  Aside from Old Dirty, yes.  So you've already  just in case it was a go.  Just in case it was a go.  I am the...  Just when you think  he can't do it.  Just when you think  there's the giant mosquito  or the cancerous live wires. 
[02:31:00]  Just when you think  he cannot...  That's stupider.  ...come up with something  that will just mesmerize you.  Michelle says...  He does.  Michelle says she's interested.  Michelle, are you...  All right.  Are you interested  in the spaz porno?  Hi.  Yeah, I am.  Can I...  Does spaz hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had a fib a little  to get on the air,  but I was just wondering  if he liked his girlfriend  a little bit  and even cared...  Even cared what she thought  about his ideas.  Yeah, have you run  this past Erica?  She heard me and Gary  talking it over. 
[02:31:30]  And what did she think  about the wonderful  porn idea?  God, if Erica's listening,  please give us a call.  Give me her number.  Erica, you have to call in.  Erica would never agree  and I'll stay on the line  and know Erica  would kill him for it.  All right.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you.  Now, one lady's calling  saying that she wants  to be in this spaz porno.  This just in from the...  Unbelievable.  The Invisible Man  checking in from  the Staten Island Furry.  My name is Spaz Quish Quish Casey.  Right.  Earl and I want to  direct a scene too.  Oh, the Invisible Man 
[02:32:00]  wants him?  Yeah.  Can we have the Invisible Man?  We'll just have some chick  like...  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Okay.  Spaz is writing something.  Why didn't you say no?  Okay.  What?  What?  Not a good time  to call Erica, he said.  But I'm sure she would  just be thrilled  that you want to go  through with this idea.  Well, she actually  didn't say anything  because she was storming out  in disgust, probably.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, there's more 
[02:32:30]  to the porno casting call,  Anthony.  Oh, really?  Spaz does Slokesperk.  But not from Jersey  who comes up  with funny stuff every day.  The name of the spaz porno  should be called  Spaz does Slokesperk.  Very good.  Okay.  Now the porno names  are going to start  coming in.  Unbelievable.  All right.  The bonus of doing the...  Are we calling it  officially the  Opie and Anthony porno  or the spaz porno?  Whatever you want to call it.  Backed by Opie and Anthony.  What would it be called?  You must have  knocked around some names 
[02:33:00]  with Gary and  whatever the other  porn guys you were with.  Basically, we would leave  it totally up to you  what you want to call it  and how much  you want to get involved  with it.  So basically,  we would do all the work  and you would get  the credit, right?  No.  No.  Everybody would get  credit for their porn.  We would promote  the hell out of this,  Opie.  I know.  So as to, you know,  get our name  in the porno industry.  That's exactly it.  It's not hard enough  showing up at the  goddamn Thanksgiving  dinners with my family  for what we're doing 
[02:33:30]  here on the air  as we speak.  But, you know,  if I could just add  porn director  and porn producer  and porn promoter  onto my resume,  my life would be happy.  That's one thing  I really want to get into.  Pornography.  You don't have to promote it.  You just direct the one scene.  This whole thing  is promoting a porno.  For one day.  For one day, my ass.  One day, one month.  This is all going to happen  in one day.  Filming everything.  One day.  We can't get through  as fast as we can review 
[02:34:00]  in one day.  I beg you to do a porno.  We'll have nothing  to do with it,  but I beg you to do it  because I need a good laugh.  It'll be the funniest thing  I ever see in my life.  We film worse.  We want the director's cut, too.  Who the hell  are you hanging out with?  Who are your friends?  Are you on the pipe?  No.  You're hanging out  with moronic  extreme wrestlers  that pound each other's brains  in with two-by-fours  and wannabe porn guys.  He was in a film.  How could he be a wannabe  if he was already in a film  that's been released,  by the way, 
[02:34:30]  and selling copies?  Selling copies.  Speaking of that,  what would happen  with this porno?  Where would it end up?  It would end up  in the porno stores  and selling.  Un-effing believable.  Will there be a scene  where a giant mosquito  comes in  and starts railing this woman  with the proboscis?  If you want that in the film,  we can have somebody get into it.  Wouldn't that be funny?  A big giant mosquito  comes in with a nose  like a dildo?  That would have to be  some of that  wacky cartoon porn, Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And just starts going at him.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Alan from Englewood, New Jersey.  Holy F.  Earl may have an invisible friend,  but I think that Spaz  has an F in invisible brain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Now he has bonuses, Anthony,  to this whole Spaz,  Opie, and Anthony porno,  whatever he's going to do.  Now he's going to spell out  the upside to this whole thing.  Right.  Okay.  This is the big pitch.  Ah, right.  This is where he, you know,  was going to get us  with his pitch.  Here it is.  Just for allowing the casting call  to take place, 
[02:35:30]  I will supply you  with two dozen videos  to be given to the audience.  So wait,  we're going to get  two dozen of the finished product  to give out as prizes.  Yeah, because you did  the Opie's porno.  You did that as a giveaway,  so I figured if you could do that,  then you could do this as a giveaway.  All right.  All right.  All right.  And if we are allowed  to shoot the casting call  and include scenes in the movie,  I will try to get at least  a gross of films  to be supplied to the show.  Oh, you're going to try  to get a gross of,  and how many isn't a gross? 
[02:36:00]  I don't know.  I really don't.  It sounded good.  Also,  he doesn't even know  what a gross is,  but he's going to try  to get us one.  No, a gross is like  the full amount of films.  A gross is that you have  a brain in your head  that you ain't using,  and a poor retard  is walking around  drooling on himself.  Also, a live event  can be planned  to coincide  with the release  of the film.  Good, good.  Live porno.  And we could have  all the players involved  appear.  Yeah.  Well, it's like  a release party. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, release.  We could have  porno sticker stops.  We'll put the  wow stickers  at porno locations.  Now, Spaz,  are you getting  beeped there, Spaz?  Are you getting beeped?  No.  My page goes on and off  from time to time.  All right, so do you  have a basic idea  for this porno?  You get all the girls  involved, our listeners.  Yes.  It'd be basically  a lot of girl-on-girl scenes.  A lot of girl-on-girl scenes,  right?  Spaz, Jeremy. 
[02:37:00]  We filmed just one scene  here of the lesbian couch  of all the girls involved.  Well, if we can't film it here,  then we'll just film  everything in the  undisclosed location.  We can just have  the casting call here.  Is the undisclosed  location your apartment?  No.  Where is the  undisclosed location?  Right here in Manhattan.  It's in Manhattan.  We need to know  because I'm convinced  there's a girl  tied up there right now.  Just waiting for R-O-K.  Right.  No.  All right, Spaz.  Now you got 60 seconds  to give us the final pitch.  The final pitch.  What else could you add 
[02:37:30]  before we give you  our answer?  Okay.  I think it's right up  your alley.  You guys talk about  porno a lot.  You guys have  the lesbian couch.  I figure you'll spice it up  by having more than  one or two girls  on the couch  at the same time.  They'll be doing  everything,  but you probably  can't describe it  on the air  but for your amusement  off the air  or on the air  they just stick  their tongues  anywhere they want.  And I just think  it'd be good  and it'd be something  a little spin-off  a little different  from just doing  the ordinary  lesbian on the couch.  Would it be more good?  More good. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  More good.  It'd be like a spin-off  of what you're really doing  just to take it  to the next level.  Like the Joni  of Chachia Porno?  Yeah, a spin-off, Opie.  A little cute  spin-off show.  Spaz,  yeah,  when you,  when,  next time you get together  with your porno friends,  your friends  in the pornography industry,  yeah,  please,  don't bring up our names.  Don't bring up the fact  that you're going  to be like,  you're going to try  to be the big guy,  that you're going  to promote them.  Spaz is going 
[02:38:30]  to be the big guy.  He's going to be  the big shot  and go into  his porno friends  and say,  guys,  I got a way  where we can make  a porno,  we're going to  advertise it  on the Opie and Anthony  show,  and we're all  going to get rich  and I'm going to pay  off my $47,000 debt  with pornography  with the help  of Opie and Anthony.  Because that,  Spaz,  that's what you were doing.  Why else are you  going to sit there,  then why not just  get together  with your friends  and make a porno  and not let us  even know about it, 
[02:39:00]  never mind try to  drag our names into it.  Because I thought  that I could bring  a show idea to you.  You think we want  to endorse porno?  A porn movie?  You did the Opie thing?  No.  That's not endorsing  anything.  There was a porno  that came out  called Opie Does  South Central  or something like that.  All of a sudden,  it was a stupid  quick little idea.  Let's give out  some of them  to people of age.  That's all.  Yeah,  and they had to  come down here  live and in person,  produce ID,  showing that they  were 21, 
[02:39:30]  and then we gave  them the tape.  But do you have  lesbian on the couch?  So?  So what's the difference  if we just have  or it's good?  Not one girl  has called.  That one girl  was interested.  Not one girl  has called.  She wasn't interested.  She wanted to abuse you.  I just figured  just have more than  one or two girls  on the couch  as usual.  Laura,  what's going on?  I just want to know  if Spaz really thinks  that even if us girls  would want to do a porno,  would we really do a porno  with his name on it? 
[02:40:00]  I mean,  after everything,  I mean,  I don't mean to like,  you know,  dissim or anything,  but I mean,  he talks about  giant mosquitoes  and things like that.  I really wouldn't want  to be in a porno  that has to do  with his name.  That's not good publicity,  you know?  That's why he was  trying to get us involved.  I mean,  yeah,  if anything,  yeah,  exactly,  the publicity,  that's why he wants  to do it on the show.  Believe it or not,  Ant and I still have  our good names.  Barely,  but we do.  Yeah,  I think you guys  are doing really good.  If this would be  a bad idea  for you guys  to get into,  I think. 
[02:40:30]  All right,  Laura,  that's what we would  love to do.  And boy,  the company would just,  yeah,  again.  Hey,  guys,  could I get my name  on that porno?  That sounds great.  Now you boys are talking  that's about  as a smart businessman.  Right.  I want you,  Open Anthony,  to help out the company  by doing a porno.  Do you honestly think  that that would fly?  You honestly,  you printed this out.  Do you want to go  to Ken Stevens maybe?  No,  no,  not with that.  Oh,  why?  Why?  It's a great idea 
[02:41:00]  for the show.  Why wouldn't you  present this  to the big boss here,  the general manager,  the one that you want  to bond with  and get closer with,  Ken Stevens,  and show him  what a great idea  you have  so he can embrace  you as an employee  of this company.  I'm going to put  my copy in his mailbox.  No,  he's coming back tomorrow.  I want to send one  to Mel.  Can we do that?  We'll just throw  one off in that direction.  It'll end up  at BlackRock  and he can read  through this.  Sure.  Okay.  Maybe Ken  could come in 
[02:41:30]  and direct the scene.  Maybe Ken Stevens  would want to come down  and direct  his own scene.  I'm trying.  Chris from Staten Island  writes,  it's Bernie W Building.  Oh my God.  So if you think  it's such a good idea,  why wouldn't you want  us to give this  to Ken Stevens?  Because you never give  any of the other  show ideas  to Ken Stevens  before we do it.  Usually give it to him  after we do it.  He actually has  a good point there.  But you know why?  That's us.  Spaz,  did you fall off  the train this morning? 
[02:42:00]  No.  Since you're rolling  behind the train.  Spaz,  you got to,  you have to,  without naming  the station  or anything else,  you got to tell  Anthony the other  show idea you had  in the office  last week.  Oh my God.  What other one?  About the power grid.  Oh,  come on.  That's a good idea too.  You were serious  about this.  Where's Ben?  You were honestly  serious about this.  Get Ben and Rick  on the mic. 
[02:42:30]  Dead serious.  Alright, listen.  Don't name the station.  I'm not.  Don't name what  power company  that you have  friends at.  Gee, yeah.  But explain.  There's so many of them.  Explain your other  show idea.  I met somebody  at the wrestling  who works for  a power company  and he said  that he could  shut off the grid  that a certain  other station  belongs to  and just during  I guess  whatever time  of day we choose. 
[02:43:00]  Do you know  how many years  in jail you would get  if you pulled off  that idea?  In jail.  Not just fired  from this company  which I think now  do we own  Baskin Robbins now too?  You wouldn't be able  to sling ice cream  at this point?  You wouldn't even  be able to work  at Blockbuster  after you got out  of doing 10 years.  Wait, let me  say it again.  Spaz came to us  last week  and had an idea  of turning off 
[02:43:30]  a power grid  here in the city  to get rid of  our competition  for a day.  Or you could  shut down  just the building  itself.  Brilliant idea.  Oh, really?  What are we dying  in an elevator?  Dude, you would be  arrested so freaking  fast.  But I would have  nothing to do with  though because I'm  not the one  pulling the switch.  You'd have  nothing to do  with throwing  the switch  but the guy  that approached  you, if you  said yes, he  would do it?  But you had  nothing, there's  nothing like 
[02:44:00]  conspiracy.  Do you know  what the word  conspiracy means?  To conspire?  I said you could  do it but I don't  want to know  anything about it.  We'd all be  thrown in jail.  Thrown in jail,  fired.  Do you remember  a few years back,  you probably don't  because for some  reason I don't know  how you even got  into the radio  industry because you  probably haven't  heard any lessons.  There was a woman  that cut a power  line to a remote  broadcast.  We're not talking  knocking out an  entire portion of  a major city, of  the biggest city in  the world. 
[02:44:30]  We're not talking  about that.  She cut the power  line of a very  popular radio host  during his show.  So only his show  got knocked off the  air.  They brought her  up on charges  that she had to  get a lawyer and  fight criminal  charges.  And she was  just fired.  She did the  actual cutting.  Right?  So that's why.  No, actually,  whatever.  No, she didn't.  No, she didn't.  It was her idea.  But it wasn't my  idea.  It was his idea.  I said you could  do it, but I don't 
[02:45:00]  want to know  anything about it.  You can't even  tell him you could  do it.  Don't tell anyone  to do crap like  that for our radio  show.  I don't want to  know anything about  it.  You are quickly  becoming a liability.  You've got to be  smart enough to say,  dude, you're insane.  Don't do that.  I thought it would be  funny.  He thought it was  a great idea.  I finally found out  where the undisclosed  location is.  Where?  It's the St. Regis  Hotel.  Rented a room out  for $750 a night.  So the budget on  this movie is very  high.  All right. 
[02:45:30]  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in  just a bit.  When in New York  City, stay at the  Park Central, New York,  877th Avenue near  Broadway Theatres in  Central Park.  1-800-346-1359.

More than all the  raindrops in the water  and all the fishes in the sea. 
[02:46:00]  You're an a-hole.  I hate you.  I just got back from  the guest party.  Jaeger, who cares?  Are you doing okay?  Yes.  Can I see your taint?  Did you order you  something to eat?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What'd you eat?  Crack rocks.  Okay.  Okay, terrific.  I love you.  Let me talk to me.  Okay, hold on.  I want you.  Hang up.  Love you.  Hang up the phone,  you twat!  I love you.
