<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts' typical crude humor, focusing on a Kim Kardashian photo and the size of her buttocks.  Frequent caller Jimmy is mentioned as being in Lancaster.  A listener voicemail detailing a bizarre traffic incident—a man attacked by women with umbrellas and a purse (possibly a Bible)—is played, sparking a debate on its authenticity.  The hosts find the caller's laugh strangely compelling despite the numerous red flags suggesting the story is fabricated.  The discussion touches upon other viral videos and fake news.  They also discuss Bruce Jenner's rumored interest in women's clothing and Opie's discovery of a crusty substance (possibly boogers) on his studio chair.  The hosts then review Louis CK's podcast,  mention a recent guest, Mike Becchetti (who shared memorable Marine Corps stories),  *The Lego Movie* trailer, and critique a Pitbull song, noting its use of an a-ha sample. The segment ends with continued speculation about the fake accident voicemail.

The show continues with a discussion about Chuck Berry's 87th birthday, quickly escalating into a wildly inappropriate hypothetical scenario involving a woman defecating on a glass table in various locations, including one host's apartment and a hotel room.  They even consider involving listeners.  The hosts reminisce about past radio antics, contrasting their previous freedoms with current limitations.  A fun fact about Chuck Berry's rise to fame is shared.  They discuss other musicians like Bo Diddley and Marianne from "Gilligan's Island"'s 75th birthday, looking up and commenting on photos of the cast. A bizarre, rambling call from a listener named Bobo follows, suggesting he and Colin would make a "super team" of guests.  The hosts find the call nonsensical and mock Bobo relentlessly.  The conversation tangents to stolen chargers, broken furniture, and an empty cereal box.  The hosts then discuss Scott and Todd's radio show, dissecting their weather reports, the game "Dead Star in the Envelope," and criticizing Todd's borrowed catchphrases.  They also discuss a 3D-printed car and a concert for "do-gooders," along with comments on Alicia Keys' physique.  The segment closes with a discussion of Yeti DNA analysis suggesting a polar bear/brown bear hybrid, and further commentary on Scott and Todd’s broadcasting style.

The show features a "Jacktober" segment with numerous, poorly received song parodies about the Boston Red Sox playoffs and Bobby Valentine's firing.  A prank phone call, "Bring Home My Gnome," follows, featuring a caller using an exaggerated elderly voice to complain about stolen gnomes, employing highly offensive language and crude humor.  Comedian Pat Cooper then joins the show in studio.  He announces his retirement from stand-up, citing health issues and the challenges of performing. He shares anecdotes from his career and a recent date with a younger woman. The conversation includes discussions about his cat, finances, and observations on other comedians like Don Rickles.  The hosts and Pat engage in crude banter.  The show ends with further discussion of Pat's retirement and the suggestion he start a podcast.


A further segment features Pat Cooper, whose rambling, often vulgar, anecdotes dominate the conversation. He discusses his career, confrontational style, and criticisms of other comedians and celebrities like Wendy Williams and Johnny Carson. He recounts stories involving various celebrities, including Sammy Davis Jr. and Frank Sinatra.  He reiterates his retirement from stand-up but remains open to acting. Crude jokes and insults are frequent, with interruptions from the hosts. A female caller expresses attraction to Cooper.  They discuss bullying, politics, and Cooper's cat.  DJ Who Kid joins, discussing his (joking) retirement and relationships with 50 Cent and Ja Rule.

The final segment features DJ Who Kid as a guest.  The conversation centers on Who Kid's surprising ignorance of Johnny Carson's death, leading to a discussion on information spread between communities.  Who Kid uses racial slurs and makes offensive jokes. He boasts about his dating habits,  discussing a planned list of 32 white women to have sex with before swearing them off. The hosts and Who Kid discuss hip-hop feuds involving 50 Cent,  and the caller's knowledge of these old feuds. Other topics include reactions to Who Kid's ignorance of Carson's death, various celebrities (including the possibility of interviewing deceased ones like Tupac and Biggie, and Elvis), and upcoming guests on Sam Roberts’ show (including Chloe Grace Moretz).  The segment concludes with Who Kid being jokingly "fired" by Sam Roberts.

[00:33:30]  little uh take a little quick uh i just don't understand the whole no kim kardashian phenomenon  phenomenon is it her mom that pushed it forward is she the brilliance behind uh kim kardashian  yeah her mom definitely kim kardashian can't talk so how does how does she even sell herself there are  women that are way hotter than her that don't have all this shit going on so how the fuck did it happen 
[00:34:00]  if you if you're absolutely uh she's very hot yes but there's a lot of broads just as hot if not  hotter didn't she get hooked up with paris hilton or something yeah paris introduced her to the world  her dad was fucking oj's you know on oj's dream team came out with a sex tape she didn't like black  guys right all the fucking little all the features all the features but she can't talk to sell herself  so how did it get this big excuse me she kind of represents this new american dream of being famous 
[00:34:30]  and rich without actually having to do anything for doing nothing right i understand but she has taken  it to the limit it's she's worth hundreds of millions of dollars she's got how many million twitter  followers 15 million or something like that someone pointed out the show is ridiculously hot still but  there's also a lot of people that watch and follow and do everything because they pretend they  don't like her i understand but it had to start somewhere now it's it's it's it's a runaway train 
[00:35:00]  with her yeah but somehow it had to get you know about together yeah people are saying that guy  sounds like stone cold et the phone caller oh maybe it's him uh well it's it's real old yeah i don't  think it's him can we play stone cold et today fuck yeah that's what i was telling you guys the other  day i know there's like these little stupid nuggets that we haven't played in a while that's one right  there we have a nugget under the console on your pants jesus christ nugget and by the way we have  not um really properly sold this week's own a podcast oh we haven't even really talked about

[00:39:00]  which was hilarious worst twitter conversation ever ever seen in my life because people are like  saying hey mike you're great on op and anthony and then he like just asked an open-ended question  like oh thanks a lot so so how you doing yeah what is that he goes thanks for the follow of them  thanks for the follow uh my pleasure oh wait i gotta find a few of these go to his timeline  that'll be the easiest but i i decided to follow him yesterday so now i i just got a lot of clutter 
[00:39:30]  i got a lot of clutter on my timeline right now so this guy josh garwick goes uh follow mike  bachetti he rules love you miss you mikey right and then mike bachetti responds god bless you so so  much how are you which makes the guy have to write back yeah which is terrible you never want to have  to write back what are some of the others hi buddy wait uh hi buddy not sure this is this is the same  thing again he was doing this guy uh steve he wrote you were fantastic on ona hope you're back on soon

[00:40:30]  that i don't know wait who shares a twitter account i see i see from time to time that couples have  the like one twitter account oh you just said it brush what was that one cory and cory and chat girl's  idea cory and chat oh that's terrible the names are terrible why wouldn't you just want your own  twitter account because you have different things you want to say and do with it no thank it's free  it is free why not just get seven and get one for your cat sure well i didn't look that's not my 
[00:41:00]  account little beavis no somebody decided to make a little beavis things get 3 000 followers already  really quick no and now another thousand because you mentioned it repost pictures that i post with  little captions on them right like oh i'm tired where's daddy today he's drunk yeah you know so  it's accurate uh we got a snopes uh page about that phone call there's just something about that i need 
[00:41:30]  to know more info good old snopes why do we put so much credence in snopes right believe that just  because snope says it's true or not that it is it's the only place you go really just try to figure  shit out exactly try to figure it out on your own no i do like the fact that they have some  explanations and uh origins and i think it's under uh um auto yeah i got it oh you got it i have faith  in the snopes all right what do they say uh voicemail message oh they're saying undetermined 
[00:42:00]  no i think it's fake i think it's fake i now truly believe it's completely i bet it was i bet it  originated as a radio thing which one that that call with the guy laughing in the fucking i bet it  originated as a radio it sounds like one of those someone would know like we have we have a phone  call wait till you hear and by the way i hear the guy is cheating on his wife so we're gonna call him  up today and offer him flowers i'm glad you brought i'm glad you brought up war of the roses because i 
[00:42:30]  think that's why i appreciated this because i'm like at least like war of the roses look beat me  up all you want i'm sure i'm getting killed on this one but i'm trying to show you my my thought  process here the war of the roses thing is so fake and you got these guys and we yelled yesterday saying  look at least if you're going to try fake yeah yeah try to be creative and do your own thing and  i think that's another reason why i appreciated this so much i'm like at least the guy's trying to  fuck is something different something whatever yeah i know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna turn a lot 
[00:43:00]  of people turning anyone around here what do they say about the call though um they said that it  happened outside a jack-in-the-box and so people reached out to the jack-in-the-box and they said  thank you for your ink inquiry this message the message that has been in circulation is an actual  voicemail message the incident occurred five to six years ago in texas i'm not sure how the  recording got outside of the company or if the employee still works for jack-in-the-box but the 
[00:43:30]  recording periodically resurfaces on the radio in the internet bullshit i like that i'm not buying it  no he was in a car it may have been a real incident like that that may have happened a little lady might  have done but that to me sounds like somebody read an account of something yeah repeating it as if  it's a live event go that could have been it and she may have done that she may have hit someone  with an umbrella or freaked out or whatever well no i mean that's the hack part of it where like you  know old ladies of course are gonna beat you up with their purses and buy an umbrella and a bible 
[00:44:00]  yeah it just sounds like the old ruth buzzy you know yeah the old ruth buzzy ruth buzzy they played  it on coast to coast in february 2005 and the show put through a caller who maintained he was the person  who had been beaten by the women of course as described in the purported voice say all right yeah that's  say that's that's pushing it too far and she hit me with a bible i couldn't believe it oh  several radio stations have interviewed a man named michael chiles michael hunt mike who said that he was 
[00:44:30]  the one who left the voicemail message can we try to get him on the show i'd love to ask him about it  it's probably a real i think his brother's jackie clint clint torres clint torres  every time we play one of those in a break i stop what i'm doing and put my headphones on i don't  think it'll ever get old i can't get enough of that same calls i know it's just that old man they're so  good oh how does he fall for it every time it's great you ever see a picture of him red no a big 
[00:45:00]  guy no it was a big guy guy yeah you can find him there's a couple of photos of red uh cut z's in  your cheeks you know a guy who says i'll cut z's in your cheeks yeah yeah i saw a photo he's an old  guy there's a photo of him outside why don't you have a little moxie and come down have some moxie  and come down i know you're i know where you live i know where you live that old gag i'm coming to get 
[00:45:30]  here why don't you go fuck yourself why did you go fuck yourself oh got him that's great has you  has uh the guy that made those calls ever come forward yes he did he did that was the guy we just  mentioned a minute ago michael chiles you know it's funny you can go to um simpsons land and uh  pick up the phone yeah that's there and hear prank prank calls like that how do you know simpsons land 
[00:46:00]  well because he rock had uh had gone there he rock annoyed jimmy and i so badly on the way home  we're just looking at each other like would you ever would you ever go to springfield land at universal  and walk around like and go into mo's and have a flaming mo and god no sounds horrendous does it  what's the name flaming mo oh you like that chip uh and simpsons land if that's what it's called

[00:53:00]  uh you can't stop uh right will farrell was the war on that ah no wait wait up  assembling 2014 by the way that song is not uh-huh oh what is oh that's take on me yeah i know  dude it's not take on me they they won't allow the band to do their own song that's that's a pitbull 
[00:53:30]  song they were playing oh but but it's from aha he completely like he bit a lot of the song it's  sampling to like the next it's a song i thought they just kind of redid it yeah well let  oh my god moments by the way that movie looks terrible even for kids uh unfortunately i'm gonna  have to probably go because they don't make a lot of kids movies it's not that bad i mean yeah but i have  to sit there it's like i can't drop my kid off i have to sit through this stuff look at me 
[00:54:00]  outside feel this moment is that the name of this uh i'm from the dirty but then she go nice  122 million views for the video everything he does is a hit  oh i know this song of course in aguilera this song was huge and pitbull is terrible  is he popular he's so popular i just want what makes him terrible he's wonderful  i just wanna feel this moment the whole thing is aha you can hear in the background even this part 
[00:54:30]  no i know the song yeah listen  yeah yeah come on come on no one's so bothersome about this is his fan base thinks he's a  fucking genius because he came up with that riff most of his fucking audience has no idea that's  an aha song they're going this is really catchy right they're like fuck pitbull knows what he's doing 
[00:55:00]  he did it again he did it again that's what sucks because i'm sure he never acknowledges  that it's an aha thing ever like maybe a little hey man just want to thank aha for giving me this  great riff for my song because i didn't come up with an original riff myself it's not even a sample  that is taking the keep going that's the song it's it's more it's throughout the rest of the song  that's crazy he just raps me up being awesome and being from miami yeah like he's like i'm from miami 
[00:55:30]  and have a lot of you take the aha riff out of it it's a shitty song and shitty lyrics it's like  just grab the catchiest part of one of the catchiest songs of the 80s right and throw it in there  it's something i don't spend a lot of money that ha aha wishes they were in front of this crowd  i don't want to say anything anyway it's all this building in tokyo long way from them 
[00:56:00]  hallways it was all in all days they can't always wait all day all day now baby we can party  hey why didn't we sing about fucking partying  we're going to the party right party you're overrated  but tam is money only difference is i own it now let's stop time and enjoy this moment  i wouldn't say this is bad this is no it's a it's a great catchy pop song but 
[00:56:30]  he completely ripped off a-ha without acknowledging he put christina aguilera on the hook right well  it should be her song you know how i feel about that i know yeah yeah christina aguilera yeah yeah  pitbull here it comes you know i gotta tell you  and it brings up another good point why you have to introduce the other singer 
[00:57:00]  when simon and garfunkel did their thing oh my god simon wasn't there like yeah yeah garfunkel's turn  yeah yeah come on garfunkel garfunkel  simon and garfunkel was not exactly a part of paul simon paul simon and garfunkel  people were like doing drugs and getting introspective to simon and garfunkel  they weren't shoving molly up their ass this 
[00:57:30]  shit he's babbling here just because the song wasn't long enough so all right i'll put my babble  in here and then we'll get back to the cool part which is she's got an amazing voice not a huge fan  but i can acknowledge that and then you got the aha riff riff that's the song she looks weird there  doesn't she another one that up her face and everything else she's also in her fat phase here oh  yeah dude i know we got fans in the studio here uh but what jesse uh uh jenna jameson did to her 
[00:58:00]  face i was creeped out i saw her on one of those entertainment shows last night what the  did she do to herself hey did he jump into a comic book frame yeah all right so that's a direct rip off  of aha's video he's like you but there's nowhere in this video where he acknowledges  that he's completely ripping off the video the song everything and his fan base i'm telling you 
[00:58:30]  they don't know where it came from he's brilliant but if you axed him uh if i axed pitbull he would  tell you it's just it's in reference to it's a it's a tip of the hat it's a oh maji uh-oh yeah  what happened we have a great rank going on right now don't we what happened kicking pitbull's ass and  telling him he's a sucks for not acknowledging uh-huh uh-oh i gotta take a phone call uh-oh  uh-oh oh really doug in north carolina go ahead doug hey boys hey are you saying that's what we are 
[00:59:00]  uh there's a video online where pitbull pulls the aha guy out on stage and he sings a little  bit with him oh i guess that's acknowledging yep huh when you bring the singer out and the singer comes  out and i think the fans really show you what we just are so wrong yeah yeah christina aguilera and  and aha guy yeah yeah pitbull all right thanks thanks doug i think we found it he pulled out the 
[00:59:30]  aha guy like you let the retarded kid score a few uh touchdown very good well let's see let's see let's  see how good it is oh notice this version of the video by the way only has 420 000 views oh and it  was the other one has 122 million it was at the billboard awards so i'm sure by the way it's they  probably suggested it there she is if it's the billboard awards they go how about look we could  get the aha guy come out and he's like who he probably went who yeah he probably didn't even know 
[01:00:00]  what's so funny was this guy singing no no i wouldn't think so although christine is very good  she's great and she could sing this is lip syncing it's all lip sync they don't want to take any  chances anymore no and for some reason we all decided to accept lip syncing for a while there we  did not it it stinks las vegas see he's the worst ever you don't like him he's terrible oh he looks  stupid he's laughably bad oh his dancing is good oh what's he doing he's like machete 
[01:00:30]  dancing dances like bobo yeah but he's like ridiculously successful it's amazing  i hate the fucking lip syncing he's lip syncing the rap yeah yeah i'm gonna do that i'm gonna just  fucking take the american degenerate audio and go lip sync it on the road that'd be fun  all right good question coming in how did he get famous from putting his voice on an already 
[01:01:00]  popular song that that's just accepted yeah that's fine now because most people don't even know aha  because his participation in the song is average at best gives a what he's rapping about just fake  shit she knows how to lip sync she does a little dynamic with the microphone notice how they uh give the  aha guy that you know the last of course 20 seconds of the song he's still not on stage didn't say his 
[01:01:30]  name y'all welcome this motherfucker right uh oh is he coming out now how much how much longer in  the song look the song's almost over we're listening to this song twice wow there's people digging this  song though yes with 12 people in the front row oh here he comes aha guy doesn't even know his name

[01:04:00]  population of the town yeah did he have to go though and he went oh good for him wow and he went  good for him for pointing it out that's right it was kodiak yeah it was kodiak alaska how funny that  people thought to do that i know right that's pretty funny and it started a hashtag exile pitbull  and so they sent him to kodiak he's gonna be a bus soon right pitbull  has he been around for a while he's been around for a while around he's got he gets commercials 
[01:04:30]  there yeah uh can we here's here's there is a giant kodiak bear behind him all these  fucking he cannot be happy about this and he did like a little show in the parking lot and how many  people were there not like not many yeah yeah because they really didn't care if he came there alaskan  chicks love blubbering up i said blubber they love blubbering up for the winter they love eating  blubber and they like looking like man wow it doesn't look that cold oh that's sad he was hoping 
[01:05:00]  for like some ridiculous crowd dude he's hoping for like the walmart in detroit right chicago that's 500  people tops and look it's a wide open field he was he was dreaming of that whole field to be packed  look at the open seats in the front row oh yeah they're folding chairs on grass yeah that's alaska  but we gotta eat why don't we uh can we play uh can we play uh-huh please oh no the original  what's wrong with it i don't know just heard it twice yeah and it is a little it's a little dated 
[01:05:30]  people did kind of that's all right modernize it up we can hear the list dina we'll be back with  october scott and todd day next it was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished him well  you could see that the air did not a fan what chuck berry not a fan never was  you like the chuck berry well when i hear this of course think of the twist con competition there 
[01:06:00]  sure jack rabbit slims johnson umma thurman shaking it up yeah i like this song chuck burry's still  alive wow five shits and he's still alive oh does he love being shit on well laying under that table  and having a girl take a dump on it what do you say i was just saying what he says the channel here  now yeah i think that would be cool to check out what the glass table oh 
[01:06:30]  hold on hold on though but i don't understand why how you would get turned on by that yeah i would  definitely check it out and go wow that's pretty fucked up yeah i think there'd be some funny in  there some holy shit in there a little fucking biology anatomy lesson exactly yeah yeah but then  to like get hard over that or whatever yeah no way believe me when you look down and you notice a 
[01:07:00]  tenting erection oh boy yeah but i would definitely i would i would giggle like an idiot would you giggle  or would you be like oh that's hard i'd be giggling you would right i'd have to laugh i think so well chuck  barry why is he uh 87 today 87 years young i wish we could do an event where we hire a woman to  shit on glass you can't do it but it would be funny to see the reactions yeah it really would be well 
[01:07:30]  we could just do it at your apartment and then we could come back there you go and just talk about  it i don't want to get my apartment yeah that would stink three of us in my apartment one should  get a hotel room oh yeah yeah i got kids i can't have it in my apartment yeah but you have a big  apartment they could be in another half they can't just be in another room yeah checking out a girl  shitting as we're under a glass table stay in there we're still busy  we'll just rent that hotel or something we should do it though and then come back and talk about it  it'd be hilarious it would be phenomenal see just because this place doesn't allow us to do what we 
[01:08:00]  know we could do very well you wouldn't do it no we should we should start doing some of this  stuff outside the studio we could but we could certainly tape some audio and then bring it on to the  show cd hotel room cd hotel room and you tell her what it's for yes uh you have to get a couple in  case one can't perform we could get a few of the listeners they'll do it for us yeah we should do  this yeah you want someone who understands a log consistency yeah right it would be funny if it's 
[01:08:30]  all about the recipe leading up to the uh the event i'm sure it could be horrible we should do it though  i say we start doing some of these things that obviously we can't do here somewhere else trip  we're not going to go and lay under a table while somebody shits on it oh that's true so unrealistic  of us to say that i had i swear to you we would have been able to do this at any w oh yeah we would  have in any w yeah we would have right in the studio no problem wait where was ken stevens he's away in  fucking dc or chicago or some other fucking place i'm having a really good time at the radio show lately but 
[01:09:00]  um i i have to say i never thought that we would not be able to do so many things that we used to  do on regular oh no oh my god that's the one thing i still can't believe regular radio when i hear some  of the events uh that we used to do and then you hear us uh hedging around the language or but that  was i didn't mind that i didn't mind it because i knew we were because i knew we were getting away  with something so yeah yeah look what we're doing but it amazes me because i listen to it i and then i hear 
[01:09:30]  us hedging around some language and i'm like oh my god this was regular radio yeah and that freaks  me out because the event itself is worse than anything we could have possibly said of course  yeah of course by the way a little fun fact about chuck berry love fun fact never would have been  famous at all if not for some impromptu phone call from his cousin marvin berry really yes it never  would have uh never would have been famous but uh yeah his cousin marvin called him 
[01:10:00]  and asked him uh or told him you know hey listen to this is this the new sound you're looking for  that close to new orleans i like this one i always thought he was ahead of his time but the kids  absolutely the kids loved it the kids will love it right  who never ever learned to read right so well but he could play a guitar just like a ring and a bell go  keith richards and those guys always want to jam with him really yeah why maybe they like 
[01:10:30]  shit on the table too they all everyone what do you mean why the beatles and the stones they all got  some some knowledge from those guys all pay homage to chuck absolutely they rip them off  early beatles yes absolutely yeah they played so absolutely there's a lot of chuck burry riffs in  there definitely is bo diddly alive uh i don't i think we lost the bow uh love you miss uh bo  did we love you miss you we check on that to see if he's alive she was in the movie 10 by the way

[01:14:30]  stupid i don't know when we were growing up i didn't mind it again sherwood schwartz would just  put out direct more laugh track garbage by sherwood schwartz the brady bunch any clips of gilligan's  island on youtube we could just uh i'm sure let's watch one come on let's get a nice laugh going  yeah man you don't have the golden years of tv let's have a nice laugh ah there it is touch me  which one you want give us some give us some choice give us some options yeah what can we watch here  some choices here yeah that's not a good one gilligan's island the laugh track the whole episode 
[01:15:00]  awful a scene we can't do a whole episode yeah we just want a good funny scene from gilligan's  island yeah what's our options oh do you want to see the one with a russian fucking u-boat  sexual healing maybe could be good no it's just a montage what oh here this is gonna oh it's an  hour and a half long jesus christ dumb movies that came out rescue from gilligan's island remember that  they really try to keep did they get off oh yeah they did but then at the end they all got shipwrecked 
[01:15:30]  again that's why wouldn't they and they were all old in their costumes is anyone gonna yeah is  anyone gonna be mad that i spoiled rescue from gilligan's island i didn't see it it's dbr we got  a great scene here starring ginger hey marianne it's agreed we'll pull our ideas and we'll split the  million dollars oh and i have a wonderful idea from mr howell's rescue oh so have i what's yours  what's yours why would you laugh there it's not one of us and i'll wear one of those skimpy little 
[01:16:00]  costumes and that's sure to attract any airline pilot that's passing overhead you're kidding they  fly at 20 000 feet well so what when it comes to girls in skimpy costumes airline pilots have radar  i think it's silly where's the last why besides listen to my idea we'll catch some fish we'll write  messages on their side with waterproof paint and then we'll release them well some fisherman somewhere is  bound to catch one of them and the messages we'll get back to the waterfront pants good idea  that's silly ideas the only one will get those messages of the other fish i think your idea is for 
[01:16:30]  the birds i think we better work on ideas separately that suits me fine skimpy costumes  that that that show fucking stunk that was a prime example of the  shit that was gilligan's island oh sherwood schwartz is a fucking creep  it's criminal that he made money on that he made a lot of money oh yeah all right they didn't poor  poor people you don't think they had syndication money no the professor and marion did you get your 
[01:17:00]  louis ck check a new one yeah 29 bucks 29 bucks is 29 bucks yeah i still get lucky louis checks for like  a dollar twelve do you when it gets like sold in like overseas video there's always some weird yeah  i love seeing why we're getting paid like it's i know the episode just was shown in sweden or  something yeah it's like always some far away land i haven't checked my mail in a couple weeks i  only check my mail once a month yeah truth the super terrific happy uh what was it super terrific 
[01:17:30]  happy hour yes it was jerry of course jerry seinfeld he would get checks  because he was in the opening in that show sick yeah it's jock to oh yeah a celebration of all  things shitty in radio that's not very nice fantastic failures of pontificating proportions that's so bad

I got boats and trees in my yard.  Oof.  He never said that.  It said Chuck Tove is over. 
[01:19:00]  Stupid ship.  No, no, it's not over.  That's the over music.  That's the out.  Yeah, it's Scott and Todd Friday.  I love it.  Very excited.  And I'm hearing maybe a potential for another catchphrase.  I heard a couple on this when I was doing it that I thought could be, but I don't want  to get expectations. 
[01:19:30]  I would rather just enjoy it for what it is.  Let it happen organically.  Exactly.  Either way, we're going to have a blast today.  Atta boy, Sam.  Well, Scott and Todd Fridays.  Who's a fan of Chuck Tove, by the way?  Rob Bartlett writing me at like 4.30 in the morning.  He's right there up on the Imus show.  Well, he should know that they're going to be featured on it.  Oh, yeah.  Tell him to tune in.  Oh, man.  Let's do it, man.  That'd be great.  Give him a good beating.  Oh, we're doing a bit.  Apparently, this guy's cheating on his wife. 
[01:20:00]  I'm going to try to send him some roses because he's stupid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That Imus is fucking uncanny.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  By the way, off the subject for two seconds, I was watching videos.  I have a bunch of our old videos I'm watching and putting some onto tape for myself, onto  digital.  And watching Patrice with fucking intern David.  Oh, that fucking line you tweeted.  I tweeted that.  It was fucking how Jewish David was.  He still has pyramid brick dust on his fingers. 
[01:20:30]  He's so Jewish.  Oh, my fucking guy.  Pyramid brick dust.  Fucking Patrice, man.  What a funny thing to improv.  Oh, isn't that funny?  He was amazing.  What a great reference for a Jewish guy, too.  Amazing.  So different than any easy, cheap reference that somebody would go for.  Yeah, yeah.  Pyramid brick dust.  And he was just fucking, it was just effortless.  And his delivery, yeah, was just fucking.  Oh, before we get into Jacktober, I've got a very important phone call I've got to take. 
[01:21:00]  Hold on a second.  Oh.  Don't do it.  Really?  What?  Don't do it.  Yeah, this is.  I knew it!  Oh, God damn it.  I'm not.  How are you doing, guys?  What?  What are you calling for?  What's on your mind?  That was the thing that you'd do that me in college would be a super team.  For fucking what?  For what?  Oh, no.  No, what I do is all over Twitter.  Who gives a fuck?  This isn't Twitter?  Like, you just called a live radio show to say that? 
[01:21:30]  Wait, what?  Oh, no.  Wait, I don't even understand what you're saying, Bobo.  What's up?  No, there's a lot of tweets between me and Colin.  Saying what?  My God.  It's going to be about me and Colin being a super team.  Oh, no.  Okay, then what?  Then what happens?  I guess, I guess, I think things just happened.  You know, is, is, does your self-centeredness know no bounds? 
[01:22:00]  We're doing, like, Jocktober, and if you were calling to have a Jocktober idea, but, like,  what in your mind would say to you, hey, let me interrupt the radio show with this horse shit?  I don't understand.  Explain why you're calling again.  What?  Maybe we'll give you a chance here.  I don't really understand why you're calling.  You're calling why, Bobo?  Go ahead.  Please.  Explain it. 
[01:22:30]  Explain it.  What's going on?  No, but I would say that me and Colin should be, like, a duo.  What does that mean?  I guess just a duo of two guests.  Yeah, it's important to call up with.  Yeah.  That's really important.  So now you said that.  Now where do we go with it?  Ball's in your court.  Yeah, I guess, guess, guess it happens. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  I guess I'm not sure.  You understand?  I think, is it dawning on you what a monumental waste of time this phone call was?  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  Yeah, yeah.  But also I haven't listened in a few days.  It's irrelevant to us.  We don't care.  There are things you can just think or tell a friend.  You don't have to tell the entire listening audience.  Sometimes you have a thought.  Me and Colin will make a good team, and it's on Twitter, and that's where it belongs.  I will say I look forward to your radio show phone calls the exact same, you and Colin. 
[01:23:30]  Well, you know, me and Bobo.  Is Colin encouraging this, Bobo?  Yeah.  And so what does he want from us?  I don't know what he wants.  Oh, my God.  Maybe this one needed a little more flushing out, Bobo.  Yeah.  You didn't think this through, did you?  No, all right.  No, all right. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  But I've cut a bit.  I've cut a bit of the pistol.  The charger for my XM.  Right.  Your dumb charger for your XM radio.  The window repair guys stole it.  Again, what relevance does that have to this live radio show?  If we were just shooting the shit and talking about the receivers, and you called up, I'd  be like, wow, bravo, good phone call, timely, fit what we were talking about.  We were going into Jocktober.  We were doing Jocktober. 
[01:24:30]  I'm talking about Patrice.  And you call up, and go, me and Colin will make a good team.  My fucking plug got stolen.  No, a super team.  A super team.  Not just a team.  Somebody stole my plug.  Valueless.  My salsic blue tipped over.  Do you understand how idiotic that is?  Bobo?  Yeah.  Comment.  My Captain Crunch box was empty.  These all have the same fucking value as what you said.  And Jimmy's your hero, so this has got to be tough to listen to. 
[01:25:00]  He knows I'm right.  I just don't understand why you haven't gotten a chance to listen to the show.  Oh, no.  You fuck.  You motherfucker.  And you already know why.  There you go.  Absolutely.  He's on to you.  He already knows why.  Sorry.  All right.  So I guess.  You got the literal response in.  Yeah.  So I guess you want a call to promote you and Colin as a super team.  All right.  Great.  How much more time would you like us to devote to this?  Up to you.  You run the show. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Should I take Benson to call it?  No, no, no.  Not at all.  No, no.  Talk as long as you see fit.  Wherever you want to go.  We're just fodder for your fucking mindless fucking meanderings in your head.  Yeah, Bobo.  You called.  Come on.  You called.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  Go ahead.  What do you got?  Go ahead.  Ball's in your court.  Bobo, you're on the air.  Go.  Go ahead right now.  Well, it was a good thought, though.  Yeah, absolutely.  My plug's missing.  I think it was a window guide. 
[01:26:00]  It's very important to stay in the middle of Jocktober.  Do you have any pets, Bobo?  Oh, jeez.  No, no, no.  I'm on to you on that one, too.  Oh, he's on to you.  All right.  You prove it, then.  What am I trying to make you say?  No, you're just trying to ask me about my dogs again.  What about them?  No, but you already know.  You already know that I've said this a million times.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  I think this was another terrific phone call.  If you have the wherewithal.  I think we're going to put this on our next podcast, actually. 
[01:26:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  What?  He's just moaning and mumbling.  See, he hung up.  Good.  You have to, sometimes, the way to help a friend is to show them the error of their ways.  You didn't like his call?  It was absolutely a waste for everyone involved.  If he was called up to go, I heard some Scott and Todd, and they said, I would say, that's  a relevant phone call.  What?  I thought that it was a perfect... 
[01:27:00]  Jack Tober.  Me and Colin would make a good Twitter team.  What are you talking about?  I thought it was a perfect time to take that phone call.  I thought it was perfect.  I love it.  I would enjoy it.  Scott and Todd Fridays.  This Jack Tober, we start with Scott trying to throw it to the weather.  Yeah.  You know, they got Joe Nolan in there.  He does the weather on ABC locally in New York.  Kinda. 
[01:27:30]  I don't think he's a full-timer in here.  Oh, no?  I think.  That's too bad.  I don't know my local weatherman.  And then he also does Scott and Todd.  However, when for some reason throwing to Joe Nolan doesn't work, Scott has no clue.  Oh, he's in a spot?  Yeah.  He can't work his way out of a tough situation?  I would call this, if Todd enjoyed awkwardness like Ron does, this would be a blueberries moment. 
[01:28:00]  You could get it for...  There's a...  Really?  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  A second of the blueberry moment.  A standalone fruit?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Scott and Todd in the morning, coming up 8.45 this morning.  Brand new album from Gavin DeGraw.  He will be here to unveil it and tell you all about it.  Nice.  But right now, Bill Evans tells us all about the forecast.  Yep. 
[01:28:30]  Yep, and took off on me.  Mostly cloudy day today with a few breaks of sun.  What happened there?  What happened there?  I know what happened there.  Todd saved his ass.  Yes.  It took off on me.  Obviously, the guy does his stupid weather on tape.  They want you to think he's there the whole fucking morning.  He pushed the fucking button.  It didn't work.  That happens with us here.  Yeah.  And then he completely panics, and he has the forecast in front of him, and he's not  smart enough to go, well, I better do the forecast.  I better do it.  But Todd realizes, fuck, all right, I got to save the old man, and he starts doing the 
[01:29:00]  weather.  More rain today.  More fake radio.  They can't just acknowledge the guy's not there.  Right.  It took off on me.  There.  It took off on me.  What took off on you?  The tree.  I want to do that type of radio.  Easy.  Quick intro, and you push a button for weather.  A lot of music beds.  How easy would that be?  A lot of music beds.  And then if it doesn't work, you just get to sit there and talk gibberish.  It took off on me.  I'd be able to handle it if it doesn't work. 
[01:29:30]  That would be the toughest part of the whole job.  The gang does some Banksy material.  Keep it topical.  Love the Banksy.  Banksy.  Now the city's trying to say that they're not going after Banksy, by the way.  Oh, good.  Because that became a whole thing yesterday, because Bloomberg doesn't understand Banksy's  art.  Did it?  But says he's an art fan.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  You know, Banksy, did you see the thing in the paper?  They fucking tackled that vandal, and it looks like the vandal from the other day. 
[01:30:00]  I might be wrong.  What do you mean?  The Asian guy?  Yep.  This guy that they tackled.  From the other day?  I don't know.  Remember, there's a video of the guy defacing the Banksy?  Uh-huh.  He walking away.  Oh, right.  Okay, yes.  This looks like the same guy.  Damn.  I might be wrong, though.  Maybe I'm just thinking because it's a hoodie or an outfit.  Yeah, Travis is just saying it's a different guy.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  So, uh...  While these people were looking, this guy came up to do it?  Yeah.  What a cunt.  Because you've got to be the first one.  So, but the Banksy fans were around there already, so they fucking, they humiliated the guy. 
[01:30:30]  They did, right?  Yes.  Look at the pictures on the paper.  They just threw him on the ground?  They threw him on the ground and then just started snapping pictures.  Nah-ha.  There's no video of it, is there?  What a cunt.  That's how they fight.  That annoys me.  You know, like, he sees people enjoying it, and fucking little baby boy has to go put  his name up.  Make it all about himself.  Oh, those fucking assholes.  Much like Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is exactly what that is.  Me.  All those graffiti artists, those jealous babies.  They are jealous.  You're fucking, you're like Bobos. 
[01:31:00]  I did it right on it, dude.  He's better than you.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Banksy is a better artist than you.  Yeah.  He's made a name for himself.  You have not managed to do that.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry.  You've got to write over everybody's shit?  You know, there's a-  I fucking hate them.  And there's a person on staff that went to one of the Banksy's, Troy Kwan.  Did he?  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah, let's get him in here.  Yeah, we've got to do Jack-tober at the moment.  I want to ask Troy.  But this is, like, a hot topic.  Yeah, it is.  Like, Banksy, New York City, and one of our guys actually went there and got a picture 
[01:31:30]  in front of one of the Banksy's.  Let's get the info right from the horse's ass.  And it's the one that was defaced, but the building owner put it back together.  Yeah, we'll see it from the photo.  Yeah, we'll see it from the photo.  Oh.  So, I'd like to talk to him.  And while they're looking at that, this cunt walked up with a spray can.  Yeah, so they humiliated him.  Good.  Yeah, so we're good with the photo.  All right, well.  And also-  Look, we just did some Banksy material.  We did pretty good.  Yeah, it is.  A little update.  What? 
[01:32:00]  WPLJ 95.5, the home of Scott and Todd, does not have a Facebook page up.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, boy.  No, man.  But they have so much fun, like, favoriting our tweets about them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the Scott and Todd Facebook page.  I guess this part of it isn't fun, huh, guys?  Huh, guys?  Oh, well, we did Banksy material.  Well, the gang over there does Banksy material.  And Scott is not on the same page as everyone else.  Oh, no.  What a surprise. 
[01:32:30]  Yesterday, elusive graffiti artist Banksy posted his 15th piece of art.  He's the guy using New York City as his canvas.  Yesterday's was a tribute to the Twin Towers.  It's down in Tribeca.  It's probably been painted over by now.  But if you want to follow his work, there are only two ways.  He's on Instagram or his website, BanksyNY.com.  If you are one of the 26,000 people like Monk who are following him on Twitter, you've been had.  You've been had.  That ain't him.  It's not him.  I got to unfollow him.  At first, I thought they were talking about that guy who used to work here. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, no, he's not an artist.  Brad Blanks.  Blanksy.  Because that's what all his Australian friends would call him.  Right.  It's not him.  Oh, my God.  What a worthless non-contributor.  I thought they were talking about Blanksy.  That's Australian friends would call him.  Man, I thought it was Blanksy.  What a dope.  That fucking Bobo phone call made me ornery.  Wow.  It was supposed to, though.  Damn.  You didn't let it get to you?  I did that for pure entertainment.  It wasn't supposed to really hurt you. 
[01:33:30]  I'm calling.  Did you see me at college?  It should be a super team.  And that asshole graffiti really annoyed me.  While they're looking.  I picked my spots with the Bobo calls.  I think I picked it perfectly today.  It should be a super team.  A super team.  Where does that go, Bobo?  I don't know.  Right.  Um, so what happened there?  Uh, Scott was trying to be relatable there or something?  Yeah, he thought they were talking about Blanksy.  Who the fuck's Blanksy?  I used to work there.  No one knows.  No one knows him, though. 
[01:34:00]  No one knows.  No one cares.  Some inside shit, but.  No one knows.  No one cares.  No one.  Guy's bloody rich from radio, too.  Oh, you're true.  This guy's bloody rich.  Dead Star in the Envelope is over.  What does that mean?  They do a game called Dead Star in the Envelope, where they have a guy's name, or a person's  name who's dead, and it's in an envelope.  And then the callers call in and guess who the person is.  That hit the cutting room floor.  Like that.  Yeah.  So, uh, Dead Star in the Envelope is over. 
[01:34:30]  Scott thinks the Dead Star is the winner.  Yeah.  What?  Well, you know, somebody calls in.  Oh, because they have contestants.  Yeah, somebody calls in and they guess.  I want to hear the whole bit now.  It was long, dude.  It was just.  Oh, God.  How does the bit go?  He had the name in the envelope.  So, like a Dead, like who would be.  This week it was George Steinbrenner.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And you thought George Steinbrenner won the contest?  And he goes, the winner was George Steinbrenner.  Oh, wow.  He's gone. 
[01:35:00]  And then Todd goes, no, he was the name in the envelope.  Oh, shit.  Wait.  So, okay.  I want to understand.  At least this is an original bit.  So, there's a celebrity that's now dead in an envelope and what?  They kind of ask.  They start asking questions to start the game and say, well, is he a movie star?  Is it a guy?  Okay.  All that shit.  And then the callers try to figure out who it is.  He's got one question.  And you finally get a winner.  Okay.  So, they reveal it's George Steinbrenner.  Yeah.  Just trying to set this up better.  And then Scott does what he does best. 
[01:35:30]  Next show on your radio.  If you're looking for dead star in the envelope, it's over.  And the winner was George Steinbrenner.  Well.  He was in the envelope.  He really wins.  Wow.  He's dead.  He was in the winning envelope.  Yeah.  Put it that way.  That's true.  Oh, God.  He was in the winning envelope.  There's only one envelope.  Didn't he know?  Do you think he was just saying that like the winner is George Steinbrenner?  No, no, no.  He worded it wrong. 
[01:36:00]  He should have said that.  All of them on the show, you could tell they all hate him so much.  They won't let him get it.  Not one inch will they get him.  No, no, no.  The minute he says anything.  He's the guy in the envelope.  No.  Fucking idiot.  No.  Oh, boy.  He is an idiot, but a lot of them have a gig because of him.  And that fucking Todd Pettengale annoys me more than he does.  Do you like his voice?  No.  At least it's funny, right?  It's a fake fucking voice.  And to me, the fact that he just borrowed that jerky boy thing as his own makes me sick. 
[01:36:30]  Something so iconic.  Right.  Such a famous, like my shoes.  Who doesn't know that that's the jerky boy?  And it's not even something where you could say, well, that might be just parallel thinking.  He's blatantly biting it.  And fucking, I don't know, Scott's just a doddering old fool.  Yeah, he's just tremendously bad.  Very good news.  This next track.  Oh, I thought one of their names was in the envelope.  Scott talks about a car being made on a 3D printer. 
[01:37:00]  He is placed directly on the?  On the?  Anyone?  What do we think?  Pano Mind list.  Pano Mind.  Yeah, it is.  I have not seen one of these yet, but some engineers in Canada have come up with an idea,  Todd, that you can actually build a car with a 3D printer.  By the way, could you pause for a second?  He says Todd's name because he looks over.  Now, this is radio.  You can't see, but imagine if you will.  Scott goes into this, launches into this great break. 
[01:37:30]  Todd is not even a guest.  Todd has his face buried in a newspaper, paying no attention to Scott and his dumb story.  He then has to say, Todd!  Todd!  Like saying, hey, look at me.  Todd's verbal language is telling Scott, let me know when you're done with your bullshit  so I can do the show.  Exactly.  So I can do my horrible fucking full story.  E-Rock, you got a take on this?  You are, right? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Also, he does the name cue because sometimes they're still out in the hallway outside the  studio.  Not even in the studio.  Because he stays in there the entire time, almost.  Ah, Todd!  He'll say their name so that they're in the hallway.  Oh, he's calling for me.  I got to go back in.  Ah!  So he'll start the, so Scott will start the break and Todd hasn't even bothered to rejoin  the show yet.  Right.  Right.  Oh, pay no mind.  Total pay no mind.  Yeah.  3-D printer.  You heard about that?  You can what?  Have a car, build a car. 
[01:38:30]  Out of a printer.  Yeah.  It's that same one, Todd.  I remember that story where the guys were using printers to make guns.  It's the same thing.  It's not a printer, like an HP that you got in your house.  No, no, no.  But they've already made a prototype.  They call the car Irby, U-R-B-E-E, and they're going to drive one of these cars from New York  to San Francisco.  A printer car?  Yeah.  It seats two people, runs on three wheels, and they say they can do it a whole trip for  10 gallons of gas. 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  It's not electric either.  It works out to about 290 miles a gallon.  Wow.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[01:39:30]  That was interesting what Scott was talking about, because it's like cutting-edge technology, he's probably right, and that fucking frosted-haired twat sitting next to him.  That fucking frosted-haired zilch, sitting there probably trying to think how to shoehorn cornball lyrics. 
[01:40:00]  What does he think, he's this young, fucking, hip, hilarious guy?  Yeah.  Scott is a doddering nothing.  Believe me, he's shit.  But I'm starting to like him a lot more, because at least he's just up there babbling and trying to do a current news story.  Well, we don't know the inner workings either.  I'm sure he's a horrible cunt, but I'm just saying, he might be a real fucking...  He's going to be inspired by that. 
[01:40:30]  In my printed car, I am driving across the country.  Go shoehorn.  Printed like a piece of paper, got a girl, I think, you know, we'll see where we'll go.  My printed car.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  I got a new song, Perry.  Who farted?  First of all.  Not me.  Oh, Jimmy's laugh. 
[01:41:00]  It's horrendous.  I didn't get any.  I had a Mexican yesterday.  How do you not smell this one?  It must be the air currents pushed it that way here.  I had Mexican food.  Fuck, dude.  Sorry.  What are you pushing out today?  A little Mexican food.  Oh, no.  But you're not pushing out any fear or...  No, no, no.  I'm not scared.  Or anxiety?  Nothing?  No, that was what happens is when I eat Mexican food, cheese and onions line my colon.  Oh.  And then they kind of like...  It's like when gas goes through, they all high-five it like a football player running through 
[01:41:30]  that thing of football players.  Oh, right, yeah, yeah.  So it picks up a lot of stink.  What did you have?  What kind of tacos?  I had the tuna tacos.  Oh, no.  Tuna tacos.  That's like a pussy.  That's right.  It was the girl lady who brought in the tacos for us.  She was cool.  Those tacos were really good.  I had three with those small, soft tacos.  I like the hard shells.  Well, how about she fucking makes bigger tacos?  I didn't mind three small ones were good.  And I had...  Stop babying your tacos.  Let's get the fucking tacos out of the back. 
[01:42:00]  No, those were tiny little fucking tacos.  They were tiny, but delicious.  Very tasty.  Very good.  She spends all day preparing.  Like taco sliders.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did.  I'm thinking of that dumb thing, too.  The gang talks about a concert put on for do-gooders.  What's that mean?  First of all, somebody just sent me a photo.  Yeah.  Of Scott Pettengill's Pay No Mind list.  Okay.  Number one, Scott Shannon.  Ah.  Very good.  Number two, ownership of comedy concepts.  Very good.  Number three, acting lessons.  Nice. 
[01:42:30]  Number four, speaking in your real voice.  Yes.  And number five, natural hair coloring.  Those are all on Todd's Pay No Mind list.  Yes.  Oh, that fucking...  That frosted hair thing is a little rough.  It is weird.  That's very mysterious.  That's some mysterious shit.  I gotta look younger because the kids are listening.  So basically, when you start fucking...  When it's a frosting...  Frosted.  A light frosting, that's mysterious shit.  Iraq, have you frosted your hair of late?  Of late, no.  You should. 
[01:43:00]  Have you ever frosted it, though?  Oh, he frosted it.  Yeah, he has.  In the early days...  Oh, he was frosted.  In the early days, yes, but then I just...  Let's get inside the mind of someone who loves frosting.  Yes, and let's do that via bullet.  He does love frosting.  On his head and in it.  What?  When I said it subtly, it wasn't funny.  I hear it.  Fuck.  What did you say?  I said, let's go to a guy that really loves frosting.  Why didn't you catch it?  Mine was just a little more subtle. 
[01:43:30]  I was inspired.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Yeah.  Why did you frost your hair?  And be honest.  Because it looked different.  It was nice at the time.  Different or cool?  Yeah.  That's a good question.  Pretty cool, huh?  Pretty cool, huh?  Does it look cool?  It looks good when the wind is through it, while you're fucking racing your boat down by the Keys.  In the late 90s, early 2000s, it was.  I wish you were racing your boat between the U.S. and Mexican border. 
[01:44:00]  The Oapster once.  Frosted?  No.  Highlighted.  Highlights.  The Oapster once highlighted.  Highlights.  Once highlighted.  Have that worked out.  Because the Oapster, when he had his hair a little longer.  Oh, no.  He enjoyed how the hair looked after the summer, because it really got blonde.  Yeah.  Because I'm borderline redhead here.  Uh-huh.  But in the summer, all blonde, because of the summer.  So then, you know, November, December comes around, and now it started getting that mousy red. 
[01:44:30]  And I'm like, man, I really like how the hair looks, you know, after the summer.  Yeah.  So how could I keep it that way all year?  So I went in, I told the guy, I'm like, look, I want some blonde in here, but it can't look  like it was done.  I want it to look natural, like it's still summer.  There's no way that doesn't work.  So the Oapster had it done.  He went home, and boy, did my dad give me a talking kid. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Did he think you were a little light in the loafers?  He was a little disappointed.  Oh, man.  He wasn't happy that the Oapster came home with lighter hair.  Oh.  Would you use L'Oreal?  I went to some, I went to, I actually went to a place in Centerport.  Oh.  Just a shitty little joint.  He yelled at you.  You should have used Smith & Wesson.  He yelled at you while you were in the bathroom, narrowing your leg to the sink.  Pops was, you know, a bit older when he had his kids. 
[01:45:30]  You know, he wasn't a Beatles guy.  He was a Frank Sinatra guy.  Doesn't understand.  He absolutely had an open mind.  Yeah.  Sort of.  He didn't understand, he didn't understand earrings, and he didn't understand lighter  hair on his son.  On a son.  And you want to guess if I ever did that again?  I would guess no.  Never.  That was it.  I was about, I want to say I was about 19 or 20, I think.  A little Oapster.  A little Oapster.  There's my story.  But frosting, I don't know. 
[01:46:00]  That, I think, is even like...  I frosted my hair.  Yeah, that's pretty gay.  Gay.  Let's just be blatant here.  It's pretty gay.  So what's the Do Gooders concert?  Well, they did a big concert in the city, I guess.  And the only way you could get in is if you got points from a website for doing good deeds.  That's stupid.  That sounds nice.  Marathon for breast cancer.  Boom!  Recycled all your cans, or I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that's nice phrasing, Sam.  That's funny.  That was accidental, but I like it.  Oh, it's terrible.  Ah, that's dumb.  How do they keep track?  It's like a paid forward thing?  Yeah.  All these people are paying it forward, so let's now get a band together?  Yeah.  Who was part of this concert?  A lot of people.  Alicia Keys.  Oh, that overrated fucking...  Alicia Keys is very good.  Why?  Very good.  She's terrific.  She's got a pretty face with E.T.'s body. 
[01:47:00]  Look, you know, there's some issues.  Huge butt.  She's got some issues.  A huge square butt.  Yeah, because you sat behind that piano too long.  Too bob-ass.  Allowed it to push out to the sides.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ladies, you can't sit down that much.  That piano bench needs to be contoured.  Right.  Because there are all these chicks that play piano.  You're sitting on this flat bench, and in order to be good, you have to play that piano  for hours every day.  So you're sitting on a flat fucking bench.  Make it a little more ergonomic for the ass.  You're just mushing your butt.  Yes.  And pushing it out to the sides. 
[01:47:30]  Can't they make a piano stool or bench that has little ass cheeks in it?  That would be nice, right?  Shape that ass.  Who else was in this concert?  I don't remember now.  I think they mentioned it.  Was that with John Mayer?  Yeah, John Mayer.  And Stevie Wonder?  I saw it after that yesterday.  It was a pretty big concert.  Doesn't sound it.  No, at least he's John Mayer and Stevie Wonder.  Fairly big ass.  Who else was in that?  Fairly big ass.  David DeGroge.  Bam, bam, bam.  Well, I guess they're talking about the Do Gooders concert.  And Scott is a senile old man. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, no.  See, Todd, you had to go on the website and amass points by completing an array of awareness  building tasks.  Couldn't you show up?  You had to do something.  I'm too busy doing good.  That much I do.  I'm too busy doing good.  I don't have time to go to the website.  Well, no, but if you're doing good, you can go ahead.  Yeah, but I didn't know you.  You got to prove it.  Yeah, no.  It was like Alicia Keys, Elvis Costello.  Pretty big event.  But you had to be, I got to prove that you did something good. 
[01:48:30]  Do Gooder.  Yeah, well, you had to do it through the website.  You can't just walk up there and say, here's what I did.  Well, what if I, what if I had been driving a Tesla?  No, it's.  You have to get points.  It's through this organization.  What if, what about, what's your car have to do with anything?  Because, because, because it's like a battery car.  Okay.  Okay, we got one.  That's it.  That's a battery car. 
[01:49:00]  That is it.  Because it's like a battery car.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Because it's like a battery car.  What is he talking about?  Why did he even bring up the battery car?  Why is he talking about a Tesla car?  I'm going to take my battery car to a boat movie because there's a tree on my house.  I don't know.  I actually know the answer to why you're talking about it.  Why?  He's a dumb cunt.  Okay, that makes more sense.  What does that mean?  It's a do-gooders concert, so what?  So he drove a Tesla.  You sign up and prove you did something for charity, whatever? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, whatever it is.  So what does the Tesla car have to do with it?  He's saying, what if I'm doing something good, like for the environment or whatever,  by driving a fucking economic.  That's such a stretch.  Environmentally.  That's such a stretch.  Yeah, I don't disagree.  It's one of the battery cars, you see.  Like a battery car.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  You're going to try to re-listen and figure out if we missed something?  You have to get points.  It's through this organization?  What about, what's your car have to do with it? 
[01:50:00]  Because it's like a battery car.  God, it's like a battery car.  All right, when you isolate it, you don't need the because.  No, no.  That's why I wanted to hear that.  Yeah.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Yeah.  That's the part we need.  Obviously.  I love it.  Yeah.  You have to get points.  It's through this organization.  What about, what's your car have to do with it?  Because. 
[01:50:30]  What car are you driving?  Because it's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  There it is.  It's like a battery car.  Oh, you got it right.  Perfect.  Nice.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Battery.  Every car has a battery car.  Battery car.  I'm fucking not doing the last three tracks.  Uh-oh.  This is not supposed to annoy us.  It's Scott and Todd Friday, and there's a formula and a way we do things around here. 
[01:51:00]  I will accept the next track.  I will.  But I'm not doing three tracks on a phony scam.  You know how we do this.  Oh, no.  We don't cut clips.  There's three tracks dedicated to another fucking phone scam.  No.  I'm not going to make it shorter than it is.  He does six-minute phone scams.  We're going to listen to the whole thing.  What's this one?  He goes to Glass's place in the Empire State Building?  They fell off.  That's brilliant shit from Johnny.  Well, before the big conclusion of Scott and Todd Day with the phone scam, we've got 
[01:51:30]  to go with the other staple of the Scott and Todd show.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That would fucking do it.  Look how mad we get.  We're angry.  This is supposed to be fun for everyone.  We have such fun with the banter.  Is it better than the, what does the sock say?  Another song by the Scott.  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  Where's the, what would the sock say song?  I got to hear that.  I don't know why you guys wouldn't have that for us today. 
[01:52:00]  They're fucking, like, World Series.  I'm not even kidding.  Some of the stuff you guys just assume we're going to want to replay.  The Sox thing, come on.  We want to replay, especially with the big win by the Sox.  So bad.  Is it going to hurt you when the Red Sox are in the World Series again?  Nah, I give a shit.  I don't give a fuck either.  Don't care.  Fudge.  Poor Yankees.  Just had a horrible year right from the beginning.  Oh, God.  Look at the way he walks.  Look at his arms.  He trudges.  He's like a Simpsons character.  B-Rock is a trudger.  People must have been trying to take pictures of him when he was in Simpsons Land. 
[01:52:30]  They thought he was one of the characters.  Oh, Tubby McFatso.  He just heard me.  Eric is a heavy walker.  Oh, he is, right?  He does trudge.  He, like, everything is like a fucking high jump.  He just trudges forward.  He walks exactly like that short film of Bigfoot that the guy took on horseback.  That's how Iraq walks.  His arms swing.  Did you read the Yeti story today? 
[01:53:00]  What?  It was one of the papers.  Did you read that?  What the fuck was that about?  They actually found some samples, and they did the DNA thing on it, and they're saying  it's like it's a mix between a polar bear and, like, a regular bear.  And now they're, like, now they're motivated to try to go find one of these fucking things  for real?  Was that?  Where did that article come from?  Where's the paper?  The one, the famous one, the fucking famous one in California.  I want to say the guy's name was Robert Johnson, who faked it. 
[01:53:30]  I'm just going by memory there.  Oh, you got a story on the line?  Can you read it?  Uh...  CNN is reporting this.  There's a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.  CNN's full of bullshit, too, obviously.  But there's other news organizations that are really, like, they don't give a fuck if  it's real or not.  Yeah.  But what is CNN saying in this article?  Well, it comes from Bigfoot Files, a documentary series on Britain's Channel 4 TV network.  Suspicious.  Channel 4.  And the works of Brian Sykes, a professor of human genetics at Oxford. 
[01:54:00]  Okay.  Well, you've got an Oxford guy involved.  That's pretty good.  Sykes' research focused on two samples in particular, both from the Himalayas, but found about 800  miles apart, one in, you know, two different regions.  To his surprise, testing found a 100% match with the polar bear jawbone in Norway that dates  back between 40,000 and 120,000 years.  Oh.  So they're saying it's an ancient polar bear.  So it could have been some fucking old, ancient, fucking prehistoric thing. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Stop.  Wait, so they're saying they found it?  I mean, what are they saying?  Wait, they took the sample from something they feel like is a lot newer than 40,000 years  old?  Because they're comparing it to what the polar bear was 40,000 some years ago.  Yeah, but.  Yeah, they're saying that it's a new, it's an animal now.  They feel like it's a newer animal they found.  They tested it and it's very accurate to what they had 40,000 years ago. 
[01:55:00]  They are genetic match to ancient polar bears.  Ancient polar bears.  What does the fox say, though?  I think it's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,  beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  I was wondering about that.  What does the chip say?  You're going to do all your characters.  What does the Craig say?  I hate Craig. 
[01:55:30]  I fucking hate Craig.  It's terrible.  Oh, you just bought yourself a year of crack.  That's right, guys.  Just be quiet.  I told you.  I know.  I can't hide this one.  I can't hide this one, though.  Oh, you bring me such joy.  But then they add the bear to the mix here, Sam, don't they?  It's a long article.  Yeah.  Oh, we all hate long articles.  If you have something to say, Sam, in the first fucking paragraph. 
[01:56:00]  I like a good summation.  Yes.  You've got to go through the who, what, where, why, when.  Yeah, but you could do it all in the first paragraph and then go, hey, if you really want to learn more, then keep reading.  That's how I would have every article.  I just like clicking on a video.  That's even better.  Oh, there's the story under the video.  Who's reading?  Oh, I see a video.  A possible video.  Let me see, Sam.  I can't see it.  This might explain everything without it.  Conspiracy theorists, the mystery of the so-called yeti is the gift that keeps on giving.  Since the 1920s, climbers in the Himalayas have been under the spell of tales by Sherpa porters and guides about a wild and hairy creature, also known as the Abominable Snowman. 
[01:56:30]  Nine.  More recently in 2007, TV producers armed with infrared cameras spent a week in the Kumba region where Mount Everest is, and they produced evidence of what they claimed were day-old footprints.  You're looking at five digits, the shape of a foot, the heel, very anthropomorphic.  We've seen that plenty of times, right. 
[01:57:00]  In 2011, scientists and yeti enthusiasts came together and said they were sure the creature lived in Siberia.  Siberia.  On visit to the Kimorovo region, the discovery of hair and a large footprint inside a cave only increased fevered speculation.  Now fresh research is tackling the yeti mystery.  Professor of human genetics, Brian Sykes, studied hairs from two unknown animals found in the Himalayan regions, 800 miles apart. 
[01:57:30]  Big feet and fucking hair.  It's one of Jimmy's gates.  Wait, pause.  Pause.  Sick with a pecker.  After the most advanced DNA tests available, he found that a sample completely matched that on the database with an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Norway, possibly dating back around 120,000 years.  120,000? Wow. 
[01:58:00]  When polar bears and brown bears were separating as different species, he reckons the mysterious animal in the Himalayas could be a hybrid of both.  The research mirrors that of mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who found a 300-year-old Tibetan manuscript saying the yeti was a variety of bear.  Yeti believers will pore over the latest findings, but they are far from a substantial conclusion, and Professor Sykes says the results need more interpretation. 
[01:58:30]  Enthusiasts may oblige, but for how long can the search be for footprints before the next step needs to be looking for bones?  That's not that unbelievable that if they find something that turns out to be a species of bear, it's the fact that it's some weird humanoid.  Right.  That's what I don't buy.  I'm saying it could be a new species.  Yeah.  You know, that we just haven't, nothing's new, obviously.  We just haven't discovered it.  Ah, new species.  Yeah, genetically it could be different, but a lot of things, you know, what happens is the DNA is passed down through seminal fluid. 
[01:59:00]  So a lot of times I'm carrying some in my cheek and gums like skull.  A pinch of tobacco, I'll take some clear stuff, and I'll rub it between my cheek and gums.  Clear stuff.  Yeah, I go into a glory hole, and I scrape around the hole, and I carry the DNA between my cheek and gums.  So I'm carrying other men's saliva and seminal fluid.  There's a lot of shit we haven't discovered yet, still. 
[01:59:30]  You think?  And I'm sure the first time someone saw an elephant, they were like, what the fuck is that?  Yeah, why doesn't he go to break?  And now we just look at elephants like, oh, look at the elephant.  But there was a time people were like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  What do you think?  I mean, it looks like they were doing legitimate testing on some shit they found.  Yeah, but they're trying to shoehorn Bigfoot into some fucking bear thing.  But there was a time, what?  There was one creature, and then it kind of split into a polar bear, then into a regular bear, I guess. 
[02:00:00]  Maybe.  Where's the missing link?  But what was that thing like?  Big, probably.  A lot bigger, you think?  Big teeth.  And then how does it just kind of mutate into two different things?  And why?  Oh, something fucks something else.  Yeah.  Something gets a heart on and rapes something smaller.  Could be a mutation, could be environmentally influenced.  But then why does the original thing go away?  You got the one that is a polar bear bear thing, right? 
[02:00:30]  Well, as things evolve, the old thing usually withers away.  It's just basic nature.  Right.  Unless, of course, the new evolved thing takes care of the part that we evolved out of.  Gotcha.  And then, you know, then they don't get extinct.  They stick around like the dodo bird.  The dodo bird.  Yeah, it's a dodo bird.  All right.  Anyway, so Scott and Todd's Friday's big boy. 
[02:01:00]  He's got some big shoes.  Give me some big sneakers.  That's how.  Dr. Chip.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  My mustache.  You asked for the what does the Sox say.  And with the big win yesterday.  And with one.  Oh, God.  And they're one win away from the World Series.  You know, this song we made fun of only yesterday is now really hot. 
[02:01:30]  It means something.  It really means something.  What was the name of yesterday's Jack Tober show?  I don't remember.  See?  I have no idea.  It was Carson and Kennedy in Boston.  Carson and Kennedy.  See, they shouldn't take it so personally.  We don't even remember them.  No.  After it's over.  But they came up with a terrific song parody.  And we're going to play their Sox thing before we play the new song parody from Scott and Todd.  Sox go boom. 
[02:02:00]  Playoffs now.  Valentine fired.  Fans cheering loud.  Fenway Park.  Big poppy.  Poppy.  Play is back with Gomes and Napoli.  Pitching staff.  With Lester's K's.  And our bats go pow, pow, pow.  But there's one sound.  The guy's out of breath singing it.  He can't even keep up with the song. 
[02:02:30]  It's recorded.  He's dying for air.  Yeah.  Well, how about you don't run up the steps?  Dying for air?  We're dying for air.  With Lester's K's.  And our bats go pow, pow, pow.  But there's one sound that we all know.  What does the Sox say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What does the Sox say?  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer 
[02:03:00]  Scott and Todd Friday's until October.  It's time for their song parody. 
[02:03:30]  Don't play that fucking song again.  Not for all our socks.  That lady yesterday.  Oh, God.  She was fucking an unsexy voice.  Scott and Todd in the morning.  95.5 PLJ.  I got a feeling, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I got a feeling.  That tonight's gonna be a bad night.  Oh.  That tonight's gonna be a bad night. 
[02:04:00]  Bad.  Why?  We're gonna find out, man.  There's the reveal.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, it's cold on our heads at midnight.  And our future ain't looking so bright.  And my space theory's getting really tight.  Tonight's the night.  They're shutting down.  So who's to blame?  Pick any clown.  It's such a joke. 
[02:04:30]  What is this about?  We're going.  I don't know.  What is this about?  Why don't we know what it's about yet?  I can't even figure out what this is about.  I think it's just about having a bad night.  About what?  I don't know.  What are they closing down?  I don't know.  Oh, the government shut down.  Okay.  All right.  I couldn't even figure it out.  Well, how about they explain that?  Also, why would you?  This was played yesterday.  Yeah.  The government was open.  It's open.  They figured they could get one more spin out of their gym.  Let's spin it once more before we can't do it again. 
[02:05:00]  One more spin.  Out of their gym.  Terrible.  Precious.  Before they have to retire it to another awful CD.  I think it was funny.  Who should play?  Pick any clown.  It's such a joke.  We're going broke.  It's up in smoke.  I got a feeling.  Oh, crap.  That tonight's gonna be a bad night.  That tonight's gonna be a bad night. 
[02:05:30]  That tonight's gonna be a real bad night.  The death seal in.  Oh, there.  The seal in.  We'll explode on our heads at midnight.  And our future ain't looking so bright.  And my sphincter is getting really tight.  Sphincter?  Sphincter, you dummy.  Sphincter.  I hate sphincter.  Who's gotten tired of the morning?  95.5 PLJ.  This is going great. 
[02:06:00]  I love that.  I didn't know that was there.  I love that.  I'll be honest.  That wasn't as bad.  Here's why.  It was topical.  Yeah.  And it was just, it was tolerable.  Like, it was actually, he was singing about something that was going on, and it wasn't  as corny and shoehorned as the other ones have been.  Yeah, okay.  You know what I'm saying?  I know.  I thought the same thing.  It was okay.  I'm trying to be fair here.  For a corny radio show parody, I was like, ah, it's fine.  That didn't matter.  It was bad.  And there's the slam.  For a corny radio show.  Well, meaning that they can't even do anything at you.  No, it was bad because, first of all, you barely even knew what they were talking about. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And it wasn't entertaining.  But minimal shoehorning.  Yeah.  The expectations.  Wait, wait, wait.  What was.  Yes, that's what it is.  You expect so much worse.  Sphincter annoying me.  He said it wrong.  Sphincter.  What was more entertaining?  Yeah.  The parody song we just heard.  Or the fake fucking phone call from earlier.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  I got my fingers crossed.  I was more annoyed at the fake phone call.  I swear.  This didn't even annoy me.  I swear.  No, this was nothing.  This was like fucking, you know, just nothing. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  A partly cloudy 75 degree day.  That's what that was.  Just, you don't even notice it.  Just kind of there.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's it for today's Jacktober.  What?  I think we.  Are you sure?  Because that's not everything that I pulled.  But Pat Cooper's coming in, so.  Pull your dick.  We got some time before Pat Cooper.  We got some time before Pat.  Patty can get here.  Yeah.  Pat.  It's all about dignity.  He might be making an announcement today, though.  I know. 
[02:07:30]  That's what I'm hearing.  Hey, Pat.  It's good to see you.  What the fuck?  Do you know what's good for me?  Ah, who cares?  You never call.  I do.  We do call.  You can't hear us anymore.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We talk to you.  Like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Like a battery car.  Battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Plug that cocksucker in.  What? 
[02:08:00]  The battery?  He sounds like a retarded child talking about stuff.  It's unbelievable.  Tree on his house.  The boat moving.  It's like a battery car.  Like a battery car.  They could just put another Scott in there.  No one would give a fuck.  No.  Just put another Scott in there and say, hey man, we'll still pay you.  Whatever.  Yeah.  But we got to get another Scott in there.  It's phone scam time.  Oh, come on.  Phone scam.  I was ready to stop Jocktober. 
[02:08:30]  Remember, you would want to say we might have a few extra minutes.  I was ready to move on.  Let's hear it.  What is that sea creature?  Did anyone figure it out?  Are you saying that as a woman?  Is he the letter C?  It's a type of fish.  Why haven't we seen it then before?  Well, obviously it's a type of fish.  I think we've seen it, but we've seen it a lot smaller.  It's tilapia.  That's a big one.  Yes.  Yeah.  Where?  Well, they've been showing it like fucking 10 people on the beach holding it up. 
[02:09:00]  It's pretty impressive.  It's a big, long, like an eel.  Oh, yeah.  It's an eel.  Would you freak out if you were in the water with that?  I freak out in the water if a fucking guppy swims up to me.  I'm petrified of fucking fish.  Are you?  Yes.  Why?  I don't want to be in the water with them.  They're scared of us.  They have the upper hand.  No, they're not.  They nip at you.  Even the little ones.  And then the big ones?  Forget about it.  Well, it's the yellow ones when you go into the Caribbean.  What?  Tiny little yellow fish will nip the shit out of you.  I'm petrified of fucking swimming with fish. 
[02:09:30]  I don't like living things around me in the water.  My fellow snorkelers know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  They're these dumb yellow fish.  They will just nip at you.  Give me a good pool any day.  They're a pain in the ass.  I hate that.  And jellyfish.  I can't even see them.  They're invisible in the water.  Fucking crazy.  How do they live?  Oh, my God.  They don't even make sense.  I don't want the real answer, so shut up.  They don't even make sense.  The blob of living jello.  How do they move?  How do they get around?  How do they eat? 
[02:10:00]  How do they see?  They're the most fucked up things ever.  Disgusting.  They're tentacles.  Phone scam time.  Not even the tentacle ones, because you can almost understand, okay, there's something  going on there.  I'm talking about the ones that are completely see-through.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck's going on there?  I don't even know.  It's an oarfish.  What's an oarfish?  Hold on a minute.  I'm not going to a guy named Chip.  Oh, there's an oarfish.  Well, come on.  You've got to talk to the guy.  You may have a good point. 
[02:10:30]  David in Ohio.  David?  My David.  Yes, it's an oarfish.  What is an oarfish?  It's a fish that fucks a lot of people.  It's an oarfish.  You fucking oarfish.  Yeah, it's a fish that helps your boat move.  Oh, that's it.  Right.  I want to see the oarfish movie.  I didn't hear you do.  Your phone cut out. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, no, you don't.  Not me.  Not me.  I love it.  What is an oarfish, though?  I don't understand.  Yeah, it's one of those really deep-in-the-sea creatures that you rarely see.  Yeah.  You know, and when they do find one, everybody wigs out.  But it's really pretty common.  They usually find them much smaller.  Wow, that thing was giant.  And it's like, you know, long, like an oar.  So they've called it the oarfish. 
[02:11:30]  Got it.  But it's some kind of mutation's happening.  Oh, yeah.  Something has gone wrong.  No, I think what went wrong was it just died and floated up.  Yeah, well, besides this.  Oh, sorry.  You weren't supposed to hear that.  Sorry.  I was trying to be sneaky.  Thanks, David, actually.  I appreciate it.  Hey, I'm always not here for you.  All right.  Have a good weekend, David.  Ohio checking in.  Here's the stupid fucking phone scam.  Phone scam time.  Pay attention.  Got $100 worth of New Jersey instant scratch-off tickets. 
[02:12:00]  We got an email from a young lady who wanted to set up her mom.  Now, she apparently helps watch the kids and really is a doting grandmother.  This didn't happen.  Thinks her grandkids can do nothing wrong.  We're about to change all that.  This is called Bring Home My Gnome.  It's called fake, fakeity, fake, fake.  Why do the prank phone calls have to have names now?  Exactly.  Oh, it's got to be right out there.  Just something to bring out the phone.  Sure, sure.  Yeah, why Bring Home My Gnome? 
[02:12:30]  Why do you see where the call goes?  Well, that.  This is called Bring Home My Gnome.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes, hello?  Hello?  Yeah?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm on the phone.  What do you...  Who is this?  You're on the phone with me or someone else?  No.  Someone else.  You?  I'm looking for Mrs. D***.  That's you?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, this is Wispin Cornholer.  Yeah.  I live eight houses over from you.  Another funny name.  Can we talk about...  Funny names.  No, I didn't hear it.  Did you hear what he said his name was? 
[02:13:00]  His last...  Wispin Cornholer.  You know what cornholing is, right?  I do.  It's when one man fucks the asshole of another man.  Ooh.  It's funny, right?  Yeah.  The captain left a sink in ship.  I guess he was disgusted by all the cornholing that was going on.  With that Q&A.  Captain left a sink in...  Cornholing.  He said it with such fucking disdain.  Oh, yes.  Nick Nolte.  Yes.  Because Roger Montalvo had been getting fucked in the ass by another guy who fucking Brennan  threw in the fucking lake. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Wispin Cornholer.  Yeah.  I live eight houses over from you on the left after two quick rights, a jug handle, and  a swing around.  You know the house?  Uh, no.  Well, what do you need?  Well, I'm calling about your little devil seeds that reside in the home there.  You mean my sweet grandsons?  Yeah, they're not so sweet.  Lyle and Eric is what we call them in the neighborhood.  Really?  They kick their soccer ball through my...  What?  You get why you call them Lyle and Eric?  Why?  The, um... 
[02:14:00]  The, um...  Menendez?  Menendez, brother.  Menendez, remember what, uh...  Menendez's...  Remember what year the Menendez trial happened?  Sure.  Yeah.  It's topical.  Very topical.  By the way, do you hear the fake old person voice?  Yes.  Well, I...  I can't talk.  I've got to nip.  Spanky.  Let's be reasonable.  Yes.  Very good.  All right.  That's good.  No, I've got to hear the rest of it.  No, no.  Now we've got to get through the whole thing.  I'm sorry.  It's three tracks.  Thank God.  I apologize.  We call them in the neighborhood. 
[02:14:30]  Really?  They kicked their soccer ball through my screen door, and they hit their baseball in my rhubarb  bush, and they scratched my VW bus with their hockey sticks, and they pooped on my stoop.  Oh, I...  The rhymes.  ...that very much.  You got the rose-colored glasses on there, Mrs. J.  No, I think you have the wrong children.  These little miscreants stole my gnome drone.  A what?  They stole my gnome, Jerome.  Oh, for Pete's sake. 
[02:15:00]  I think a six goes here.  Oh, no.  Why?  Is that a...  Is there an arrow pointed to your penis?  What?  One, two.  Oh.  What happened?  I need you focused on this, buddy.  The other track or something?  Yeah, you're, uh...  I've got to try to figure out where the one goes.  No, I understand that's a Sudoku deal over there.  His voice is utterly enraging.  The thickness of his voice.  I've got to get a gnome's change.  I've got to get my gnome, Jerome. 
[02:15:30]  Gnome, Jerome.  Poop on my stoop.  I've got poop on my stoop.  You like that?  Funny stuff.  It's like, I want to sit him down in a room and just look at a chair and go, what are you  doing?  It's good stuff.  It's good stuff.  You mean, what are you doing because I'd like to learn how?  That's what I hope he said to Dave Douglas.  It's good stuff.  It's good stuff.  What?  It's good stuff.  It's good stuff.  You knew when Dave Douglas would come in and complain about your content that you had  promised him you wouldn't do it.  Shut up, Sam.  Yeah, but you know.  And then he'd say, you guys promised you wouldn't do that.  It's good stuff.  It's good stuff, though.  I hope he would say it's good stuff. 
[02:16:00]  That's how it would defend our point.  It would anger him.  It would anger him.  What?  It would be, what?  It's good stuff.  Because you know what?  That sounds like you're not taking him seriously as your boss.  I've got to hear that again.  Oh, my God.  But first, that's all right.  Yes, yes, please.  Uh, this poor lady has no idea.  Yeah.  She's on the radio.  You know what a gnome is?  I know what a gnome is.  I have not seen it.  Well, I haven't even described it. 
[02:16:30]  How would you know if you've seen it?  My angels would never take anything that doesn't belong to them.  Well, who's in charge of Heckle and Jekyll over there?  Me.  You are.  I am their beloved grandmother.  Yeah, but you're not doing a very good job there, Mrs. J.  No, I have a lot of experience with children.  You do?  Yes, I do.  Listen, do you know if they plan on making a ransom call or am I supposed to hire the A-team to get back my gnome drone?  No, the A-team.  The A-team.  The fucking A-team. 
[02:17:00]  The A-team.  I gotta hire the A-team to get my gnome drone drone.  Remember that show?  Oh, my fucking God.  How am I going to get that back?  Is Gilligan going to take the boat and go to get it?  Would that be a good line for him?  It would be more topical than the other shit he's been saying.  He comes up with clever names for the boys, though.  Oh, he does, yeah.  True.  Yeah, this is Whippoorwill Jones.  Heckle and Jekyll.  Oh.  The Menendez brothers.  Lyle and Eric.  Is he going to go with Bonnie and Clyde? 
[02:17:30]  I hope so.  I mean, this stuff is just fun.  Does he go Bonnie and Clyde?  I don't think so.  Fuck.  I'm Jerome.  They do not have your Jerome.  Why don't you keep Butch and Sundance inside for the winter months?  I was close.  I was fucking close, Sam.  That was close.  Shit.  Butch and Sundance.  Butch and Sundance.  All right.  That's really fucking good.  I see what he's doing now.  He's going with those names.  Why don't they keep...  Those names of people that got in trouble.  That's fun.  Why don't they keep Fredo and Michael? 
[02:18:00]  How fucking old are you?  Fredo and Michael.  That guy's the worst.  Of your Jerome.  Why don't you keep Butch and Sundance inside for the winter months and give the neighbors  a little break?  I saw the little one whizzing on his dog yesterday as I was looking out my window while the big  one documented the whole crime scene on his flip can.  His dog ring-tin-tin.  Oh, check YouTube.  I bet it's viral by now.  If anything about my babies goes on YouTube, I will set John Pugh Kelly on you. 
[02:18:30]  Who's that?  He's a very famous attorney.  Do you have his number?  If I did, I wouldn't be giving it to you.  Why in the world would I give it to you?  Well, why should only one person have good representation?  Well, you go find out where he is for yourself.  What the fuck is he doing?  Maybe I'll hire Gloria Allred and she'll show up at your door in her best pantsuit.  You know what?  You'll be visiting the Wonder Twins at Rikers Island by the time she gets done with them.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:19:00]  Maybe you can bake them an applesauce cake and smuggle in some blows so they can negotiate  the conditions of their dating calendar.  Well, that was a cut-in.  Did you hear that?  No.  I've got to go back.  You didn't hear that?  That was a bad one.  That was a bad one.  You can hear the background noise drop in and out.  It completely drops out because what he did there was he had a clever line he thought  of after the fake phone call and he decided to pump it up by squeezing it in.  He did it with the last two comments.  No, I hear them, but this one's really bad.  By the time she gets done with them. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Maybe you can bake them an applesauce cake and smuggle in some blows so they can negotiate  the conditions of their dating calendar.  Well, I don't even know what that means.  I am too old to take this from an individual I have never seen who probably looks like a  gnome.  I don't look like a gnome. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, I don't look like a gnome.  It's fucking stinks.  Oh, man.  It's fucking stinks.  Break a breaker for the bandit.  You better not come around here.  She's doing a typical old lady fucking cartoon voice.  I'm literally surprised she doesn't yell, a masher is assaulting me.  A masher.  Puppies.  This is utterly horrendous.  Hear our comment?  He edited part of his own comment because the background noise of her call. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Dropped out, but then comes back as he's still talking.  So he edited his own comments.  It's terrible.  It's just terrible.  You guys ready for the big reveal here on the funny phone call?  Please.  It's all about the big reveal.  Apologize to me.  I apologize to you.  But to your grandchildren, I curse at them.  Oh, my goodness.  You know, that's just terrible.  Well, they're robbers.  No, they're not.  They're stealers.  I don't believe it.  I will never believe that. 
[02:21:00]  Well, do you know where is my gnome drone?  I have never seen it, heard of it, don't know what it looks like.  An old lady would stay on the phone this long like this.  It's probably in your bureau room.  None old lady.  My bureau room?  What is that?  Where your dresser lives.  I doubt that very much.  Could it be in your drawing room?  I doubt it.  How about your kitchen area?  Or my kitchen area.  What about your garage?  And I don't have a garage.  I want my gnome back, my gnome back, my gnome back, my gnome back.  I want my gnome back, my gnome back, my gnome back.  What's your name?  Whispin Cornholer. 
[02:21:30]  Well.  You writing it down?  I'm writing it down, and I'm going to call the FCC.  Your daughter knows me.  I don't think she does.  No, she does, because she actually called me to set you up.  You're on WP.  Why would she know that it was a radio thing?  Why would she say, I'm going to call the FCC?  FCC only deals with broadcasters, basically.  And TV.  Oh, boy.  And other, like, minor shit.  But in general, radio and TV.  So why would she be knowledgeable about the FCC when this is supposed to be a real phone call? 
[02:22:00]  Why would she say that?  What an idiot.  I'm going to call the FCC.  God, he's fucking horrible.  But that is true.  The FCC does deal with phones, too.  Oh, nobody would say that.  Come on.  It says the FBI.  Yes.  Come on.  You writing it down?  I'm writing it down.  Oh, I know what FCC means.  Fake call, cocksucker.  Fake corny call.  Yes.  Now.  I'm writing it down, and I'm going to call the FCC. 
[02:22:30]  Your daughter knows me.  I don't think she does.  No, she does, because she actually called me to set you up.  You're on WPLJ radio.  What?  You've just been phone-skinned.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  What?  Thank you, Mrs. J.  Okay.  Okay, have a good day.  Bye.  Oh, I apologize to me.  Wow.  For Pete's sake.  What?  I love it when she rolls with that.  You've seen my gnome.  I have not seen it. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, right.  You're starting to giggle a couple times in that scene.  Yeah, no, I loved her voice.  Sometimes you get a voice like that, you know?  If anything about my babies goes on YouTube, I will set John Pugh Kelly on YouTube.  You've been phone-skinned.  You've been phone-skinned.  Oh, my God.  What?  You've been phone-skinned.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you've been phone-skinned.  Oh.  I hate that we're in this business, these fucking idiots. 
[02:23:30]  They fucking stink.  I like the boys are back in town.  You've been phone-skinned.  But this is why the business never gets respect, and this is why A-listers and all these other  fucking people don't want to do radio.  Yeah, because of that shit.  Because of this horse shit, because there's way too much of it.  God, is that fucking enragingly bad.  It's embarrassing.  Oh.  You've been phone-skinned.  You've been phone-skinned.  Yeah, have I?  Have I?  Oh.  You've been phone-skinned. 
[02:24:00]  Do-do-do-do.  Ah, just take care, Mrs. J.  Hey, this is WPLJ Radio.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Oh.  You certainly phone-skinned media.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh.  That's it for today.  Thank you, E-Rock, for helping us out with this.  Yeah.  Be out.  Scott and Todd Fridays.  Never fails.  Never fails.  And we got a new clip out of it, which is great.  What's the...  It's like a battery car.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:24:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know what?  We're back in with Scott and Todd Fridays.  Excellent.  I'm glad.  Last Friday, I don't know.  I was thinking, fuck, maybe it was a bad idea.  So we're back in.  We'll do another Scott and Todd next Friday.  Nah.  Yeah.  God, that's terrible.  I got a tinkle.  Yeah, I got a fucking...  Oh, yeah.  And Pat Cooper is here.  I think I could take a piss.  Pat's...  He wanted me to promote before...  He said to promote that I'm going to be at Stitch's Comedy Club in Lancaster tonight 
[02:25:00]  and tomorrow.  That's really weird.  What?  He wanted you to do that?  Just a good guy.  The Amish are people with dignity.  What the fuck do I know about making butter?  Clippity-clopping up in my wagon.  Yeah.  Hey, ride the horse.  Fuck you on the horse.  It's over.  How many times are we going to hear that today?  Oh, boy.  Pat's weird because I think we're friends with him, but you're just not sure.  Yeah.  He gets the shit out of you. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  I like when you don't know if he's going to talk about something nicely.  Right.  But he'll say something, like, kind of nice, and then he realizes he's about to smash it.  Of course.  The Amish, they like to churn butter and make shoofly pie.  Fuck the shoofly pie!  Like a schizo.  He turns on a dime.  Yes.  Fucking Pat.  He's nuts.  How's the family?  Yeah.  We'll talk to Pat Cooper next.  And for real, I think he's making an announcement today. 
[02:26:00]  We're not in on what the announcement is.  Oh, no.  He's not coming out, is he?  Oh, God.  Imagine that.  I'm gay.  That would be great.  I'm a woman trapped in a man's body.  I knew it.  The first time I sucked a cock.  It was marvelous.  Yeah.  Someone's like that.  He's waiting for me.  Yeah.  The Bible says a man shall not lay with another man.  Fuck the Bible!  Who told you that?  The Opie and Anthony show is back. 
[02:26:30]  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  A couple things really, really fast.  Pearl Jam tonight, Travis.  Pearl Jam tonight in Brooklyn, right?  Barclays.  In the hizzy?  In the hizzy.  You wouldn't go see Pearl Jam, right?  No.  Come on.  God, I'm gone.  Me and Travis are going.  Tonight?  Pump this asshole.  You want to go?  No, I'm going to be in Lancaster.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:27:00]  You should go, man.  Pearl Jam in concert is great.  No, because I have to work it out, so a gym in concert is better.  Two and a half, three hours.  Look, I know that they give good shows.  I'm sure that is a great line.  What song have I been listening to obsessively is the fucking, uh, the single he did?  Oh, my God.  He passed the show outside.  I can't wait for Pearl Jam tonight. 
[02:27:30]  What are you putting in a fucking alley?  All right, Pat Cooper.  Pat.  Pat Cooper.  Please, sir.  The great, the great Pat.  Please.  I ran a corner from you, you sick.  I don't even fight me here.  I haven't seen you lately.  This guy lose 45 pounds.  That's talent.  That is.  He did drop a ton, didn't he?  You're not in the neighborhood anymore.  I haven't seen you walking around.  All right.  Don't talk to where I'm at.  Do you not live there anymore?  Don't tell him where he's at.  See, that lady in the corner that with the shaking for the coins. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  So I said, I'm going to do something.  I give her $5.  Yeah.  She goes, thank you, sir.  Turn around.  She leaves.  Took my five fucking money.  That was it for the day?  Excuse me.  That was it.  I'm sorry.  I saw you first.  Now I want to show him respect also.  How you doing, Opie?  I just, we did this outside.  Well, you know, you're a prisoner.  You want to do it on air?  How many fucking times I told you you're a prisoner in this fucking job?  You're a fucking dead human being.  You got to understand.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Why did he get a pussycat?  He's lonely. 
[02:28:30]  He's fucking lonely.  That's why he got a pussycat.  You'll understand.  That's where his fucking brain.  He got his own show.  That pisses me off.  I have no fucking animals in my apartment.  Flies don't come in my apartment.  You should see how he's now considered a genius in the animal world.  I like the little kitty.  He's fun.  You like your ass.  That's what you like.  He's fun.  He's fun.  He's not fun.  He's sick that he's wound up with you.  No.  He plays around.  He scratches it.  I think he's talking about me now. 
[02:29:00]  I think he's talking about me and not the kitten.  I'm happy to have you back, Pat.  Pat, you should get a kitten.  Yeah, you should get a kitten.  You should get a little kitten.  I saw it on the tape in the bedroom.  Right?  He's playing with it like a little lost fucking Italian.  If he did this in fucking Italy, they'd shoot him.  You don't have a little booty cat like that.  You got a fucking lion.  You're Italian.  He can't join the mafia with that fucking pussycat.  They sit down on a sit down and go, who's got the pussy?  I'd shoot his fucking balls off. 
[02:29:30]  You're not a man.  Get rid of it.  People are talking about you.  I'd rather be fucking gay and have that pussycat.  That's right.  Anthony's both.  I like the idea that you're fucking confused.  No.  You can leave him alone.  You can leave him alone for a weekend.  You don't have to walk it like a fucking dog.  It's terrible.  This has been holding your career.  I hate it.  Believe it.  Oh, my God.  I say sold out, but it's in the bathroom.  I don't want to know why I didn't do this.  Jesus Christ.  So what's going on besides that? 
[02:30:00]  Well, I hear you have a big announcement.  This is my last show.  What?  What are you talking about?  Come on.  I did.  I quit.  What do you mean?  No, I retired.  Honestly.  I retired because my body said it.  Why?  Really?  See?  Is that why he lost his hair in the back?  I got nothing to play with.  I'm just going to fucking die if I just let my body tell me.  You've been singing that for years.  What do you mean you retired?  16 years, I can't hear.  22 years, I got tinnitus.  I'm on the stage, and I'm fighting it, but you know something? 
[02:30:30]  It's okay.  Now, the body's saying you can't fight it no more.  Now, what you want to think used to take a second.  Now, I'm down to 12 seconds if I want to think.  So now, I got a problem.  Then I say, guys, write notes so in case you forget.  I pick up the notes.  I can't read my handwriting.  Jesus.  Now, I'm standing like a schmuck.  So I go in the audience to ask him what the fuck I wrote.  That's what I knew.  That's kind of funny.  That's funny, though.  That is funny.  That's funny, though.  That's funny, yes.  But that's when you know it's fucking over. 
[02:31:00]  Jesus.  Now, I was told by my brain surgeon, I swear, Steve's here, and he says, you have great attitude,  but you're fucking old.  Oh, boy.  So I said, fine.  And he shows me a print of my brain.  He says, you have a good brain, but the two dots in the corner, he says, that means you  are old.  So do what you do.  I said, what should I do?  Quit.  Jesus.  So I quit.  Now, I'm happy here.  No, you can't quit.  It's not like you're a boxer with a detached retina. 
[02:31:30]  You can't quit.  Right.  You can just keep doing it.  Now, I ain't doing shit.  I ain't even gonna do this show no more.  I don't give a fuck who wants me.  I'll turn down them all.  I hope Carson's reborn.  I can break his ball.  They're full of shit.  So if I did it all?  You can't quit.  The only thing I gotta do, I'm jealous of this son of my god, Norton, because he lost  weight.  He did.  Well, he's lonely.  What the fuck?  Yeah, everyone's lonely.  You better talk to him if they're getting a cat, you say.  I know.  You should get a cat.  Boyd.  Boyd is always good.  Boyd.  Boyd is terrible.  Boyd.  Boyd saved us years ago. 
[02:32:00]  We all had canaries because we thought of his gas.  The boy dies.  We were fucking killers.  We were killing fucking birds.  Ah, the poor birds.  You know, you don't do that.  No.  That's what we do.  We kill you fucking birds.  Wait, are you really?  You retired?  For real?  I'm going to say one more time.  I'll come over.  They have to break the fucking first.  We don't like this news.  My altar god.  Yes.  Steve, what's going on?  Get on the mic real fast.  I don't want to do it no more.  I did it all.  There's no more mountains to climb.  That's the end of it. 
[02:32:30]  And there's a man, my buddy, right there.  I talked to him outside the studio.  He's very depressed.  This is one of the reasons.  They want me on a cruise.  That's when I know it's fucking over.  Oh, Jesus.  I'd rather be on a raft than drown.  Steve, what's going on?  Well, he found a new girlfriend that he met at the Apple store when he lost his phone.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's got a girlfriend.  New girlfriend.  Excuse me.  I was talking to the wait list there.  What did you say?  I'm sorry, Steve.  I told him you met a girl at the Apple store when you lost your phone. 
[02:33:00]  Well, you know something.  I deserve what I get.  And I met this lovely lady because, you know, she was talking to this guy.  And he didn't know this.  He's a nice kid, a college kid.  And, you know, she was gorgeous.  She looked like Kim Novak.  Oh, yeah.  Then at nighttime, she left that door.  What?  It's a Barbara Eden.  So if you let Kim Novak, you took her out in the early, whatever.  And we went out to dinner.  And I said, what were you doing in the Apple?  She says, well, I'm looking for a kid, you know, on his computer.  She said, but they're so expensive. 
[02:33:30]  The one I want is $2,000.  I said, really?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  And she kept saying.  I said, well, that's it.  I took out a check.  And I wrote her a check for two years.  You sugar daddy.  I didn't hit on her.  I don't want to bang her.  I don't want to fuck her.  I don't even want to talk to her.  I gave her the check.  And I says, this is the young kid.  It was the night before.  Wow.  I said, this is my Christmas gift to you.  If I never see you again, you owe me no obligation.  Wow.  She says, oh, my.  She didn't know.  She thought I wanted books.  Next day, she said, my God, I bought the thing. 
[02:34:00]  So I took her out four times.  Oh, man.  Wonderful girl.  I said, who are you now?  You're Barbara Eden, you're Kim Novak.  And she went, oh.  So we go to Tahoe.  Tahoe.  That's the Chinese restaurant.  Everything's in the dark there.  And everything is humming.  So I go, excuse me.  I said, I can't.  I said, I can't see.  She goes, yes, sir.  Can we help you?  I said, yes, sir.  I tell you what, because I'm very big with it.  Give us everything.  Oh, there you go.  Hauderbes. 
[02:34:30]  Hauderbes.  She goes, really?  Everything.  So I said, honey, what do you want to drink?  She says, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So forget God.  Drink something.  She says, I want a lemon jello dip.  Holy Jesus Christ.  What's a lemon?  $27.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  $27.  I could have paid for my fucking rent.  So she had another one after the first one.  Oh, wow.  She goes, you know, they don't hit you yet.  I said, I don't fucking want to.  I wouldn't hit you yet.  The hors d'oeuvres are gone.  And the woman says, you want something appetizer? 
[02:35:00]  We just had a fucking appetizer.  I'll just turn it out.  It's for the fucking appetizer.  I said, see, she wanted fish.  I went, give me anything.  Oh, a lot of fucking food there.  All over the place.  And the waitress is looking at me and winking at me in the fucking dark.  Then I found out it was the light.  So she turns around and she goes, are you going to eat what you got in your plate?  I said, excuse me?  Are you going to eat what you got in your plate?  I said, well, why do you think it's in the plate for us?  I'll take it home.  What? 
[02:35:30]  She took that home.  Took every fucking thing home.  She took the back.  My little thing.  What do you call me to get the message in there?  The fortune cookie.  Oh, your ad-lib?  Yeah.  Fucking.  Fucking.  Fucking.  So I said, I can't even get that.  I'm not putting it down.  I'm putting her up.  She took everything.  Here's the coup de grace.  Okay.  And I'm happy.  I'm not looking for sex.  I'm happy.  I got somebody to talk to.  The food's great.  You're out with a girl.  It's nice. 
[02:36:00]  Stop interrupting.  All right, Pat.  I'm sorry.  Let him get to it.  I'm sorry.  So I call her.  She wants to go for pizza.  It's on a Wednesday.  Oh, she says, I'd love to go for pizza.  So I take her over Pat's pizza on 74.  And she goes, oh, my God.  She says, Pat, what a wonderful time.  She says, but you know, I have to lose seven pounds.  And you'll take me to a fucking pizza?  Oh.  She goes, well, then I'll eat the pizza with tea.  Nobody eats fucking pizza with tea.  You sick fuck. 
[02:36:30]  Are you embarrassing me in front of my fan club in this fucking place?  The nurse, the nurse, the woman says, I'm the waiter.  Did I hear you say fucking tea?  She says, well, yes, I have to lose seven pounds.  Stop swallowing.  That's how you lose seven fucking pounds.  And I haven't heard from her since.  Wow.  But she ate two slices and drank the fucking milk.  And that was it.  That was it.  Steve, how old is this broad?  She's in her 70s.  Pat likes to think she looks younger.  Listen to me.  I know fucking 70s.  I was 70s.  The picture on her business card was taken, like, about 30 years ago.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:37:00]  Listen to me.  All right.  She is good looking.  All right.  Can't you get bigger?  Like, even if the notes you wrote are too small to read, can't you just get, like, a bigger  cue card?  Like, it'll be easier?  If they get any fucking bigger, they won't see me.  What the fuck is he telling me?  What the fuck is he telling me?  I know comics.  Look, we're all joking aside.  I, what, I have, you're a comic, and you're a great guy, and a great comic.  Thank you.  Without rhythm, you're shit.  Comedy is rhythm.  When I know on a stage that my rhythm is not rhythming, I say, before I turn around and 
[02:37:30]  have people say, you know, you don't get the message, listen, I'm 85 in my 85th year.  God bless.  Thank you.  Where the fuck are you going to go?  You know, I saw God Love Henry Youngman.  I saw him, and I loved him, walking on with a wheelchair, trying to read the cards, and I  said, that's not going to happen.  I got my dignity.  Forget comedy.  Forget all that shit.  You got dignity.  You'll get it.  It'll be a Thursday when you get a cramp in your balls.  I got dignity.  But he has the rhythm and the timing still, Steve. 
[02:38:00]  No.  Everyone hears it.  Don't tell me about my fucking comedy.  Let me explain something to you.  I thought it was being nice.  24-7, I can do this.  It's easy.  I don't have to worry what I'm going to say.  I never had that.  But I don't want to go on a stage now saying, I can't say that shit no more.  Well, now I don't believe it.  How many times can you repeat this shit?  And I'm good.  I ate new stuff.  But I would walk out there and say, let me see.  Where am I going to go?  Why should I torture myself?  I made a good dollar.  I mean, I can't complain. 
[02:38:30]  I'm looking good for a guy 85.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm going to lose weight now.  Maybe that's why he's successful.  The fuck do I know?  How about a podcast?  The sign that you got in that place there, put it out so we can see it.  That you sold it out.  What sign?  You got a sign.  It's all over here.  Oh, that's an old one.  No, you got to take it home because it's embarrassing.  I was there that night.  You didn't sell it out.  I meant I sold out artistically.  I love you, man.  No, but Pat went on a podcast.  Pat Cooper, you could do a podcast where you talk for an hour about anything you want into 
[02:39:00]  a microphone, and it gets downloaded.  You are made for a fucking podcast.  Yes, yes.  Pat Cooper would do an amazing podcast.  Let's do it.  A podcast.  What?  Mad, what?  A podcast.  It's like a radio show.  Uh-oh.  But you're just talking, and it's recording, and it's a one-hour block of just you talking,  and people download it on iTunes.  You would be fucking great at it.  Your podcast would be-  Who listens to that?  A lot of people.  Oh, my God.  A lot of people.  A lot of people listen to them.  They're fucking huge. 
[02:39:30]  Why am I listening to?  You're a failure.  I don't fucking-  You're a failure.  This is-  No, but you know something?  Yeah, yes.  Go on.  John Rivers has the television.  You know-  A telepromp.  He has that.  That's okay.  But you know something?  I feel bad that I'm letting me down that I'm better than reading that shit.  You know, I don't want to read that.  And particularly if some of the material that they say, when are you going to do the thing  about that?  And that's-  I don't want to do the thing about that.  I don't want to do that anymore.  I want to go out and just take chances. 
[02:40:00]  But when people are paying, say, $40, $50 to see you, I don't want them to gamble  on my bullshit.  So I said, hey, you know something?  Stop.  And I stop, and I'm okay.  How long has he stopped for, Steve?  About a month.  Three months?  Four months?  Four months.  People-  I got an offer.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Do you miss it?  No.  Do you miss it?  No.  Let me tell you something.  Because it's not fun anymore.  Let me tell you something.  This is another reason.  All right.  Patty, how are you?  I'm very sad.  How are you?  How are you?  Patty.  You can't quit.  Why?  Listen to me. 
[02:40:30]  Your public wants you.  Where the fuck is my public?  What do you mean they want me?  I got a job for you, Patty.  Okay.  How much?  Well, you know, things are tough.  Oh, jeez.  They're tough?  Did I cause the toughness?  How come the congressman don't call me if I'm a fuck-up?  I said, how much?  Because Patty, I'm embarrassed to tell you.  Do what the fuck you call me for?  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it, Patty.  You know, you do it.  And just say, this is my last.  I don't want to tell people.  Yeah.  Now they want to have a big party. 
[02:41:00]  Sure.  The final.  You know what I'll do?  I'm going to do it.  Yeah.  But the next day, I'm going to go back to show business.  That's what I'm going to do.  That's how you fuck up.  Then I can do it again.  I'm going to retire in another few days.  That's my talent.  He retires for a living.  Yes.  I don't like this.  I don't like this at all.  If you get sick of the material, if you get sick of saying the same stuff, I go out and  I do cheap tickets.  I'll do really cheap tickets and tell the crowd, I'm working on material.  So they come knowing that they're watching a process.  I'm going to nose you with that shit. 
[02:41:30]  But I mean, it feels good, though, to do that.  I made big albums, you sick fuck.  Big albums.  Who the fuck wants to hear?  It's not that.  I never did the exact same thing in a row.  I'll get a little bit of a tirade.  It makes you feel good.  But it's not fun no more to get on that stage and need help.  You know, it's like if someone says, Pat, you're walking, here's a crutch.  And I say, no, I don't need the crutch.  I'm old enough to walk.  So I'm okay.  I'm not looking for nothing.  You know, I've got a couple of grandkids and family there, so that's it. 
[02:42:00]  I've got Steve who helps me, and I've got another friend, Johnny Galassi, who helps me.  And when you start asking people, I need somebody to help me, that's being smart.  I could say, well, I feel good.  I'm all right.  I need somebody to answer my phones, because who the fuck wants to listen?  I need somebody to take me to the doctor.  He takes me to the doctor.  You know, I feel good.  I mean, and I don't say to them, you know, he's got dignity.  I pay him.  The fuck?  I pay him, and he calls me back.  And nothing's wrong with him.  The doctor keeps saying there's nothing wrong with you.  You know, you do that. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, boy.  Except you can't hear.  No, you're working for me.  But I don't say, you've got to do this, you've got to do that.  He calls me every day because I had that clicker.  I just called to see if he's alive.  I had to click, you know.  The life call.  No, don't let that fall down.  I can't get up.  I can't get up.  Right, right.  I fell down.  I said, I can't get up.  And the guy said, I'm on lunch.  Back and a half hour, I'm on lunch.  You know, I see the funny things like you do.  I'm sure you see television.  He should throw that out.  And, you know, that's why I love guys like him. 
[02:43:00]  He's incognito.  He'll always be a star.  See, me, I was never a star.  I was a name.  And I tell most of the comics, don't fuck stardom.  Get the money.  Get the money and get your reputation.  Now, when I went on Snyder years ago, if I would have went on Snyder today, I'd have had a reality show.  Because they called me a prick, a big mouth, a piece of shit.  I said, you fucking nuts.  Somebody was taking my dignity.  I defended it.  Bet you weren't on television.  Yeah.  And it was my mother. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, I'll attack her too.  What the fuck is this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And now they're all doing it.  Everybody's doing it.  Sister's saying, you know, you're a cunt.  You're a fucking cunt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  On television.  But that's what it is.  When I said to go, Pat, to hear Patty, he blew it.  We better make some phone calls, talk to the boys or calm him down.  Boys are wasting, are you?  The fuck you're calling to the boys?  How about the girls?  Even the girls, the mafia woman.  You see cement?  Mary Cement?  A fucking thing.  A grenade would turn her down.  A fucking grenade. 
[02:44:00]  I never saw ugly like that in my fucking life.  Oh, did you see that face?  I would go to jail with a smile.  What the fuck?  There's more prettier people in jail than her.  I don't like this.  Mary happiness.  How about, I like the idea.  The world needs Pat Cooper.  A reality show.  Would you do a reality show?  You'd be perfect.  No, destiny is reality.  I'm trying to, how many times have I done it?  Five, six times?  I've been trying to help you.  They said, you'll scare these guys.  I don't want to scare you.  You've got two children.  I feel like you're my family.  Yes.  Every time I see her coming around the corner by the footlong, you're a footlong fucko. 
[02:44:30]  You know, and he's just so proud.  We really miss you.  And the baby spits at me.  Takes after his old man.  You're a good, happy guy.  I pray every day for you.  Not him, because he's got a cat.  I'm a cat.  He's got companies.  I'm a cat now.  But you've got two children.  God bless you.  Three and one.  Did I nail it?  For what?  Your kids.  What?  Oh, three and one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One is three and one is one.  I'm amazed.  How does he know that?  But you know, there's a different jam.  He has a memory.  He keeps the...  When he's not working, you don't see Opie. 
[02:45:00]  Shh.  Uh-huh.  He walks like with a little fucking strut.  A little swagger.  He's got a swagger.  I go, oh, you're dying.  She goes, isn't he wonderful?  I go, oh, Jesus Christ.  Isn't he wonderful?  And then Mr. Happiness comes along.  I go, how you doing?  He goes, none of your fucking business.  Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy.  You know, you look great.  I tease you guys.  Just speak.  Don't over fucking do it.  Don't be a fucking Cary Grant.  You're ugly.  You know what I mean?  We all live in the same neighborhood. 
[02:45:30]  We haven't seen Pat in a while.  Pat lives a block away from me.  We don't see Pat anymore.  How many times have I said to you?  He's back, you son.  How many times have I said to you?  Make me an irregular.  Yeah.  Anybody can be a regular.  Right, right.  Put me on every day.  You are an irregular.  Yeah, that's what I...  But it's an absolute.  Who gets these kind of fucking laughs?  Who?  No one.  I don't get me with a fucking top hat.  I don't get me with tattoos.  I don't get me with a fucking attitude.  I'm fucking dynamite.  Pat, I got to ask you, though.  You retire.  What are you going to do with yourself?  Well, you want to know? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  That's easy.  What?  That's easy.  Torture people like you.  I made a lot of money.  Wait a minute.  I made a lot of money, okay?  And I didn't turn around and play the part.  Sure.  I was married 45 years, and I saved.  My wife saved at this.  She said, when she died,  I didn't know I was wealthy.  Oh, gee.  And I was wondering why the fucking mattress was high  and one that was high and low on the other.  She saved my ass,  because I don't know how to...  I didn't give my fucking money away.  Right, right.  She said, when I found out...  Gave two grand to that chick at the Apple store. 
[02:46:30]  Steve looked me up in the computer and said,  I understand you're worth 15 million.  I didn't know I was worth 15 million.  I called my accountant.  I said, I'm worth 15 million.  She said, Steve, he's full of shit.  I'm full of shit.  15 million.  Who the fuck looks at that?  I know how much you're worth.  Now with the cat, you're going to...  Well, the cat food is expensive.  You have to write the cat off.  It's called pussy time.  Is that it?  I can write the cat off as pussy time?  Do you have...  You're not married, are you?  No.  Smart.  Yeah.  He was, though.  He was.  I know that.  We don't want to go into that.  But see, let me explain something to you.  When you're down at Animals, 
[02:47:00]  next you're going to take a safari.  No safari.  With a face like that,  you need a fucking wall.  I mean, look.  All due respect to Don Rickles.  I love Don Rickles.  Sure.  I cry at Don Rickles.  He's one of the best.  He was.  I love him.  But he's walking on the stage.  He's not...  He's not all there.  And I'm saying, what the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  I can't retire.  And he could tell me, mind my business.  I said he would be right.  But I said, no.  You know, you're special.  He's special. 
[02:47:30]  But it seems to me that work,  this work has...  That's what keeps you going.  That's your drive in life.  Have you seen him when he got up the stage?  He ain't going nowhere.  No, I mean you.  Because of my yarn.  They said, you just got off.  But the work has kept you going over the years.  No.  Now.  Now, relaxing.  I want to go to Italy.  This is relaxing.  I've got to go to Italy with a blind girl  and tell her I'm Cary Grant.  That's all I want.  I want to spend money and go out there  and get some money.  I gave...  I'm not bragging.  I gave $100,000 to St. Jude  for my wife's family.  Oh, there you go.  But now my daughter's suing me. 
[02:48:00]  So what does that tell you?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm kidding.  Oh, well, I hope not.  So you want to go to Italy?  I'd like to go to Italy with somebody  that likes to go with me.  I mean, Steve, you know, he's Jewish.  It's a little heavy there.  They take him to Italy  because he don't know  what the fuck is going on.  Half a time.  You know, he doesn't understand  that y'all might get here with some fedora.  I'm getting one made out of hair  so I can wear a fedora.  No, but I would like to go, you know,  with a guy or a girl,  just a...  I don't want no sex or shit.  Sure, sure.  But you know something?  It's not going to happen.  No?  No fucking way.  Make it happen. 
[02:48:30]  That's the reality show.  That's the reality show.  Oh, my God.  Pat Cooper is going places.  Right.  And you fucking send Pat places  with a camera crew  and he fucking walks around  and he explores places  and he talks  and he meets people.  Oh, imagine that.  And he's hilarious.  Literally, we already have the show.  I get up at 3 and I go to bed.  That's why you're looking.  I got no wrinkles.  I mean, what the fuck?  You look amazing.  I can't believe you're 85.  85.  He has more energy than any of us.  Oh, boy.  Wait, that's...  I said, I feel something here.  You feel something.  Your chin will check it. 
[02:49:00]  There's this guy talking  when I'm talking.  I know.  He is.  It's the funny, bro.  Is there a raid?  Really?  Friday, Friday.  Are we being soon?  What?  I don't know what the hell he's doing.  We don't even know what race he is.  Sorry.  He's crazy.  Rebecca Black?  I think Rebecca Black just walked by.  You got somebody coming on?  No.  We're going to follow this shit.  We clear the field, Pat.  We're very smart.  You're very smart  that you don't bring me  in the middle of the week.  Nah.  Because the next day's guest  wouldn't want to come on.  Right.  We're going to fucking follow this shit.  You can't follow Pat Cooper.  Why is he like... 
[02:49:30]  Are you throwing your voice?  What?  He keeps talking.  I'm not talking to you  when you're throwing your voice to him.  He answers.  Look at the wall.  It says OPN to Anthony.  What am I supposed to do?  Shut the fuck up?  You're smart.  You don't want to get involved.  So, I don't know.  We got to talk about his career.  Well, there's no career.  The ups and downs, though.  Like, some of your thoughts  about your career, sir.  Listen to me.  If you would have told me  1963 or 62, 
[02:50:00]  I would have said  I was happy in those days  of May, $1,000 a week.  $1,000 in those righteous  a lot of money back then.  You know, I had two kids.  I wasn't in show business,  per se.  There was no stand-up comics  in those days.  You know, I worked  a little bit of vulnerable  that was still hanging around  in the late 50s.  And I was just happy to work.  I drove a cab.  I needed extra money.  And I'm saying, okay.  Then all of a sudden,  I met a Willie Webber  and he says,  Pat, you're different  than other people.  I'm going to put you on Gleeson.  I said, yeah,  he's going to put me on Gleeson. 
[02:50:30]  And he did.  Eight months later,  I went on.  And all of a sudden,  like Sunday morning,  after the show was shown,  I'm doing Bobby Darin  at the Flamingo.  I'm going into the Copacabana.  I'm going to do,  I'm working with Sammy Davis.  I'm working with Sinatra.  I'm working.  And you sit there  and you think  that somebody's pulling your leg.  Because what I did  was an Italian routine  that everybody said,  you can't do that.  That was 1963.  And I'm saying,  what do you mean  that you can't do nobody?  But Gleeson put it on  and that was,  this is why I'm here today.  Otherwise,  I'll still be driving 
[02:51:00]  a cab,  which I wouldn't be  afraid of,  a shame of.  And doing what I do,  I had to make a living.  So when I got into my role,  I was making a living.  Then when I met some pricks,  when low-life pricks,  I went on television  and said,  he's a prick,  she's a prick,  and he's a prick.  They're all pricks.  So they said,  you can't say that.  Why?  Because you're a prick  and I'm a prick.  Oh, man.  But,  not one lawsuit,  nobody came over to me  and wanted to punch me out.  A couple of wives got out of you.  You're out of order.  I said,  listen, Al, 
[02:51:30]  Al,  my dignity,  you might as well kill me.  That's all I own.  And I didn't say that  to be a wise guy.  He said,  but calm it down.  Calm it down?  I called him a prick.  And I swear to Christ.  And they had to sit down.  But me,  I was a little,  you know,  I was a little skinny.  I had to stand up.  You've burnt a few bridges  over the years.  No, no, no.  I have to torture them.  The bridges are still there,  but it's not bridges.  Because today,  everybody's squealing at everybody.  That's true.  Now,  Wendy Williams,  yesterday,  I'm watching her  and I see what her bullshit is. 
[02:52:00]  And she's turning around saying,  well,  I did all that when I was 16.  And I did that.  Who gives a fuck,  Wendy?  Get down to the point.  You're full of shit.  All right?  You're full of shit.  We don't want to know  about who's throwing,  who's banging,  who ain't banging.  Tell me why  that country's in fucking shit.  Pat,  do you think your career  would have gone further  if you would have played ball  a little more?  No,  I don't play ball with nobody.  I fall.  I can't catch my balls  I can't catch.  I don't play ball with nobody  because if you're putting me  in an element,  it's like you say to me,  Pat,  fix the television.  I can't. 
[02:52:30]  Right, okay.  So you don't do it.  But I know guys who go,  Big Al said to fix it.  He must know.  And you'll burn me.  Fuck you.  You say I can't do it.  I did weddings.  Yeah.  You never got paid  because Big Al's the party.  You're the best.  Nobody.  You stole the fuck away.  What the fuck is the money?  But when I went  and stood in a hotel  in New York,  never got a bill.  Went to the restaurants  in Little Italy,  never got a bill.  So when people say,  they didn't pay you,  I say, 
[02:53:00]  I got more than pay.  Nah.  That was months at a time  I was staying at the Halloran House.  I never got a fucking bill.  They were there,  and I never said anything.  I just said,  what do I owe you?  So you over-tipped  so you're good old.  Sure, sure.  So the white guys  don't think you're a cheap fuck.  So I was over-tipping.  It was better to pay the bill  than fucking over-tipping.  So I was going broke  by over-tipping.  Should have just paid the bill.  Well, no.  In the restaurant,  I get a bill sent for $100.  Yeah.  And the waiter said,  no, that's on the boss.  So I gave him the $100  because I didn't want  anybody to think.  So the guy said,  why don't you do that? 
[02:53:30]  I said, let me explain something.  If I paid the $100 tab,  20% is $120.  I gave him the $100  and I said $20.  You made $20.  Yeah, the guy says,  you're a cheap fuck.  But people don't think that.  You know,  that's how you save money.  Don't you do it?  You'll go broke.  But you know  what's going on here?  I'm not important.  No, no.  Let me explain something to you.  I'm not important  because I'm not involved  in my government  to see what I can do.  You know,  I don't vote no more 
[02:54:00]  because the people  that I want to vote for,  they're dead.  I mean,  give me a break.  They're dead.  Harry Truman is dead.  He's a man that sold shirts.  He knows about money.  He knows about prices.  Some of these fucking guys  don't know.  They're the worst.  You know what they call them?  You know,  you heard of gangsters  and gingerillas.  A gingerilla is a gay guy  who wants you to think  he's tough.  That's the difference.  So there's a lot of people  out there.  This is why bully now  is becoming a big thing. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  What do you do with a bully?  Kill him.  Stern was the best bully  being paid than anybody.  And I said it on television.  I said it on radio.  All right.  You know,  I said what I had to say.  I'm not going to enhance on it.  But, you know,  the fucking bully.  What do you do with a bully?  Punch him back.  Fuck him.  Get a fucking gun  and blow his fucking brains out  because you're defending yourself,  you sick fuck.  Yeah, but he said  I'm so stupid.  My mouth,  your mouth,  punch him in his fucking mouth.  That's how it sits out there.  I tell my Greg, 
[02:55:00]  she goes,  but I'm a scared.  I'm a scared too.  I'll punch you  if you don't punch him.  There's a better way.  I mean, really,  listen,  why are they doing bullshit?  You see the cop  in fucking Florida?  He's my hero.  He's arresting now  the 13 and 14-year-old  who's a bully in people.  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  And what about the girl  that threw herself off a silo?  Oh, that's terrible.  I mean,  you ought to talk about  these poor kids.  There's a picture of her right there.  Right there.  She's on TV.  She's on the news,  right there.  Listen,  I don't look at the wall  when I'm here with you.  I got walls at home 
[02:55:30]  I can look at.  He wants me to look  at a fucking wall.  That's why I'm blowing.  That's why I'm boring.  That's the story  you're talking about, though.  The exact story  he's talking about  is on Fox.  It's right there.  Look, see,  that's the girls.  That's the girls.  Listen.  Oh, God damn.  Wow, they're too open.  Common sense.  He's in the middle.  Common sense.  It's not in this fucking world.  True.  Because a great,  great man  is running our country  we ain't got right now.  I'm knocking this guy, 
[02:56:00]  you know,  he's a nice guy,  but he's a little lost.  We need guys with balls.  Yes.  Now,  what do you need?  You need guys  who have that gangster attitude,  but they're not gangsters.  And when they say,  what are you going to do  when we got to turn around  and show ID  at the airport?  We don't show nothing  at the airport.  What'd you say, Sal?  We don't show nothing.  Whoever wants it,  the motherfuckers are covered.  We will fucking kill them.  You understand?  Yeah, but that's gangsterism. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, what the fuck do you want?  You want to go to the airport  and have your bags checked?  We kill the mother...  Anybody's got a drape  around their ass,  we kill them.  But he may be a shoe.  Well, that's his problem.  Shoot him, too.  We shoot everybody.  That's why we're being  held hostage.  Yes.  We make that point every day.  We got gangs in Afghanistan.  We got gangs in this country.  We got gangs in this country.  Then they got poison in Syria.  You want to eat some of the food here?  It's worse than fucking poison.  I got a guy that makes  the chicken gaga goots in there.  And that's why he's  giving him a piece of bread. 
[02:57:00]  I know.  I almost choked.  But I gave him $14.  But what are you going to do?  He looked at me.  I was scared  because he looked a little shaky.  I said,  I'm going to shove  the next sandwich down my throat.  That's what we need.  Common sense.  This is why you guys  really  are too quiet.  Fuck.  I thought it was a compliment.  I told you that the last time  I spoke to your son.  I like flying under the radar.  We're flying under the radar.  I don't know if we're quiet here.  Tell them, Steve.  We're not quiet.  No one bothers you.  The only thing good about radar,  if you spell it backwards,  it's still radar. 
[02:57:30]  Wait a minute.  Think about that.  That's why you fucked up  with your cat.  Is it a girly cat  or a boy cat?  It's a boy cat.  Don't forget to get it neutered.  I will.  I know.  I spoke to what's his name.  I'll get him neutered.  No, I spoke to what's his name.  The guy in The Price is Right.  Oh, right.  Bob Barker.  Bob Barker.  No, Drew Barker.  Not Ralph Barker.  He's fucking dead.  Bob Barker.  He's dead.  Bob Barker's dead?  Well, somebody's dead  in that fucking show.  I got Drew Carey.  The fuck you want?  There's the nicest guy in the world,  Drew Carey.  Yeah.  And he takes it at the end,  the best part of the show,  after the same price is right, 
[02:58:00]  he says,  get you spayed and neutered.  Spayed.  I thought it was an ace.  What the fuck?  That doesn't work.  I'm going to pussy,  you can't pussy.  All those years,  they're saying that,  and it hasn't worked.  You're going to...  What made you do?  You know, first of all,  your ex-wife's butt,  she's feeding.  She wants to fucking kill you.  Her cat is better than me.  Fuck her.  Listen, I'm going out with her.  Don't be a woman.  Well, then you'll fucking  retire to the grave really quick.  I'll tell you that much.  Go out with her.  Listen, we all had mistakes.  I had a first wife. 
[02:58:30]  She wasn't a bad woman.  She was just, you know,  people dragged the hair,  dragged the hair.  But, you know,  that's yesterday.  We should try to better ourselves.  See, now this here,  see, this is hurting my career  coming here today.  But you retired.  He's back in show business,  the prick.  This is not his.  This is trying to explain  to you people out there.  The genius is still out there,  but he quit.  I don't know.  I shot myself.  I go on the subways myself.  That's a New Yorker.  I never forgot where he came from.  I don't know what you're going to do.  That's what makes me who I am.  I don't know what you're going to do  with yourself, though.  You got too much energy to relax. 
[02:59:00]  No, this is not energy.  Yes, it is.  No, let me.  I just told him earlier.  I go take a nap at two,  get up at three,  and go to bed at four.  Why are you fucking around with me?  You don't know how to take care of your body.  That's why you're talking to me.  You know what?  He believes that maybe the pussy  will find something rotting in him.  No, my fucking body's rotting,  you sick fuck.  Don't let him see you in the shower.  He'll take that thing  going back and forth.  It's a tube.  Oh, no.  We don't need that.  Steve, he's turning down gigs.  It's over.  I can't believe he looks like a gangster.  He got a pussycat. 
[02:59:30]  He's obsessed with your cat.  I love the little cat.  He's great.  But he still performs in life.  And you don't even have to...  Not like a dog.  You got to walk him every night  and stuff.  It's just cold out.  You know, I hate when you talk that way.  I got a guy in my building, right?  Makes $80 a day walking 10 or 12 dogs.  I give him five, he walks me.  What's another five hours?  That guy's making a living.  Then he goes, you want to go back?  And I go...  Everybody walks their own dog 
[03:00:00]  in my neighborhood  because I live out on Long Island.  So it's not like the city.  Of course.  He is very lonely.  Very lonely.  He's lonely.  I don't think so.  That's why you're here.  You're off at big time.  You gave it up to be with this guy,  Mr. Happiness.  He's very lonely.  At least he's got two kids  better than a dog.  Pick him.  Adopt a kid.  Adopt me.  I got a job.  Too much work.  You got work?  I like being able to run off  to Atlantic City for a weekend  without having to fucking have kids  or a dog or anything like that.  So you're going to take your cat? 
[03:00:30]  No, I leave him there.  You just put some food.  You put some food out.  I know.  You have a little box.  They take care of themselves.  You put him in the fucking car  while he's going on.  I would.  It's a hot car with the windows  rolled up.  Fuck him.  Yeah, I know.  You're my kind of guy.  That's why they call you breakfast.  Exactly.  God bless you, buddy.  You're a good guy.  This is no fucking around.  He's announcing his retirement  from showbiz.  What if they want him for a movie?  He'll do a movie and he'll do TV. 
[03:01:00]  He'll do a movie or TV,  but he's done with stand-up.  Oh, movie or TV.  Yeah, okay.  So you're not retired?  That's another thing.  I quit.  What?  I was born and raised in New York.  Never got an invitation  to do the comedy thing.  Never.  No?  Never invited me.  They go, you know,  they go, what's the name  from California?  This one from Texas?  This one from out there?  I said, wait a minute.  I'm a fucking funny man.  They don't invite me.  Caroline, she's not full of shit.  Who the fuck are you, Caroline?  Who the fuck are you  to dictate policy?  What makes you think  you're fucking funny?  You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
[03:01:30]  Some of the shit  that you buy is embarrassing.  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of it is shit next to me.  Yeah.  That pisses me off.  If I wasn't better,  I'd back off.  But I'm better  than a lot of the shit  that she's putting in there.  Wow.  Because all of a sudden  we're expecting her  that she knows comedy.  She don't even know silence.  He's never played Caroline's?  Is that what he's getting on?  No, no.  I'm talking about  the yearly thing.  The New York Comedy Festival.  The festival.  What?  Well, that's not the point.  Let me turn it down.  Let me turn it down.  He just wants to be able  to turn it down. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  You know, Caroline says,  well, I've got her,  I've got him.  Who the fuck cares?  I saw some of these geniuses  at a roast.  Can't fucking get a smile.  A fucking smile.  And this broad sitting there  saying, you know,  you're fucking brilliant.  Why the fuck ain't I working?  You're a sick fuck.  Where'd you come in  from comedy?  Oh, no, bud.  You got a divorce.  You wound up  with nine fucking million.  I got tiny million,  not 50 million.  Now you know Steve.  Fucking pull down.  See, that's what pisses me off.  I fight for my dignity.  They're stepping on it 
[03:02:30]  saying I don't belong.  Fuck you, Caroline.  You don't belong.  And some of the shit  you advertise  outside your fucking Carolines,  what happened  to your other Caroline?  Caroline South.  It went South.  Because the people  down South New York  know you're full of shit  and I'm pissed off at her.  Why don't you tell them  what Richard Lewis  said about you?  Oh.  Richard Lewis.  I don't see him that often.  Wrote him a fan letter.  I don't know.  He calls me through a friend.  He says,  Pat, you know,  you read my book  and it's nice.  And by the way,  it's in second printing.  Don't get envious. 
[03:03:00]  And he took names out.  I turned around.  What is this guy doing?  Carlson?  Sam, what are you doing?  Oh, I know.  He's going to that barber there.  Get laid barber.  Did you read about it?  No.  What happened to that?  Today, yesterday's paper.  She's called to get laid.  $110 and a 20% tip.  She gets people laid by the haircut.  I swear to you.  I got no hair,  so I'm not going to get laid.  You got a great hair.  You still got the hair.  No, but I'm going to point out,  that's where they make money.  I got a barber.  It's one and I'm shorter  than the other.  I got, you know,  she's got $15.  I give him a fine on that tip. 
[03:03:30]  You're right here.  But, yeah,  the one side is always longer  than the other.  But she can't have everything.  You understand?  How does she get you laid?  Huh?  How does the barber get you laid?  By giving you a...  Listen to me.  I read the whole article  in the paper.  And it says that  she changes your attitude,  your face.  She shows some pictures.  And then they got women  that said,  I got a...  I wound up with a trio.  I got laid.  So who the fuck knows?  A hundred...  Can't get in.  That's crazy.  And what about  the Johnny Carson story  that I've been calling him  a prick for years?  Oh!  They said, 
[03:04:00]  I'm out of order.  Meanwhile,  he peed on my leg.  I had to take that.  This cocksucker  and peed on my fucking leg  in front of my wife.  They said his wife  was fucking a gift.  Everybody was fucking a...  Everybody's getting fucked.  I ain't getting laid.  Everybody's fucking.  Now he's dead.  They want to get...  They're going to write a book.  The lawyer.  That's called...  The lawyer.  You know,  that's called...  That's a spy.  Yeah.  My fucking lawyer.  If I write...  There's nothing to write about me,  but if you ever read it,  that's terrible.  I bet there's some good stories  about you.  What?  I bet there's good stories.  Dynamite stories.  They could write about you, 
[03:04:30]  the lawyer.  The second book you're going to read,  it's going to be...  I'm going to fucking write.  Do you know what the name  of my book is going to be?  What's that?  Don't go see your aunt  unless your uncle's there.  Don't go see your aunt.  You had to think  that's why you're a dummy.  I did.  That's why you're a dummy.  He sent you a bed.  That's why you're a dummy.  You had to think  that's why you're a dummy.  Richard Lewis.  Back to Richard Lewis.  What happened...  What happened with Richard Lewis?  Kenny.  The Richard Lewis thing. 
[03:05:00]  Well, so he turned around  and he...  He calls a friend of mine  who was a good friend of mine anyway.  And he says,  Richard Lewis  has got to tell you something.  And I know him for,  you know,  I've known him over the years  and I wasn't like hanging out.  Like I know Norton,  but you know,  I consider him a friend,  but I don't...  I'm not around him all the time.  And he says,  Pat,  let me tell you something.  And I said,  Rich,  what is?  That doesn't look  going to be a piece of shit  or something.  He said,  nobody holds a microphone like you.  And I says, 
[03:05:30]  oh,  you know,  I had paralysis.  You know,  it goes Pat.  And he went on  and he said,  I was the best ever.  He said,  nobody can shine your shoes.  He said,  that's coming from me.  I seen you everywhere.  Fist that.  You're un-fucking-believable.  Well,  that was nice.  And then I stood there  and I go,  I better quit  now that I'm ahead.  You know,  he said,  another comic.  Norton has never said  that he just said hi one time.  So I said to Richie,  he wrote me a letter 
[03:06:00]  and he told me,  and that's nice coming  from a fellow,  you know,  a fellow comedian.  And I never looked at it that way,  but I know I'm a little special  than the average  because I,  like he says,  I took chances.  I did take chances.  And you know,  you're not supposed  to take chances.  I did  because when you fuck  with your dignity,  that's all we own.  Jesus Christ.  I mean,  you look around  and see a guy like Rickles,  all the wonderful things.  I look at him,  I go,  Jesus Christ.  What a wonderful career.  And then I see him  walking with a limp.  It bothers me  because I think he's special  and he should now maybe retire 
[03:06:30]  because I don't think  he's all there  the way I would like him  to be all there  because there's no more.  He actually believes  there's an Eskimo  in the audience.  There's no Eskimo.  There's a guy  sucking on a nice pot.  The Eskimo.  He now believes  there is an Eskimo.  It's the problem.  You know,  and I say that  about a lot of these guys.  You know,  we're all old.  I mean,  George Burns,  and no disrespect,  I worked with him,  I worked for him in Reno,  and it's a wonderful thing,  but people are paying  to see if they're going  to be at the show 
[03:07:00]  where he's going to die.  Oh, damn.  It's the truth.  I think you're right.  I'm saying with Sinatra.  When Sinatra fell  in Rhode Island  in the theater  and around,  the guy said,  I was close by,  he looked like  he was going to die.  As I turned blue,  he said,  he started throwing up.  He just fainted  this poor fuck.  But they wanted to say,  I was there when he died.  Right.  You don't have to worry  about that.  You want to know  when I die,  I'll call you.  That's all.  This guy,  hey,  you write when I'm talking.  What are you writing  when Pat's talking?  What the fuck, sir?  How disrespectful.  What are we going to write?  What are you writing?  What are you writing?  Do we still have  five reads to do? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, Jesus.  So you don't interrupt  Pat with that?  Yeah, man.  You could do him  on that fucking shit  after show you do.  Stand up,  it's your dignity.  Fuck him.  There you go.  That's a job.  You'll get another one  with that hair.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You'll be the son  of Frankenstein.  Five reads,  for real.  What the fuck's that about?  What are you doing?  Do I have one arm on?  I don't know what happened.  Do what somebody else is on.  Exactly.  Yeah, no,  somebody's great.  Comedians that come here.  He's the greatest.  They're all jealous.  I don't even want to come up here.  That when he lost 45.  You know what they told me  some of the comics?  That prick, 
[03:08:00]  he did that to offset us.  I said,  what do you mean,  offset you?  Now we're talking  about his fucking weight.  Years ago,  we didn't talk about  his comedy.  He was getting his comedy.  Now we're talking  about his weight.  You're a hit with your weight.  They say,  they say,  not just great weight.  The guy's not saying  the poor guy,  the black guy's got  my Mr. Cooper.  He's the Mr. No,  we're talking about  45 pounds.  You've got to be kidding me.  My body's 45 pounds.  I said,  where's the 45 pounds?  In the toilet.  But you did it.  I did.  Now what did your girlfriend say? 
[03:08:30]  I don't have a girlfriend.  You're smart  because you're gay,  you son.  I know about guys  I got you.  You're like baby's diapers.  Don't bullshit me.  What else has known  since I came here?  I don't know.  Fucking same old shit.  Pat,  we come in,  we do this,  and we go home  to my cat.  Listen to me.  You would have  more fun quitting.  What?  Because people,  they would talk about it  for a week  and then forget about it.  Then come back.  Exactly.  Then come back.  It's the biggest thing.  The brand new act.  No,  don't come back with him. 
[03:09:00]  Oh yeah,  with Pat Cooper.  Oh,  we'll fucking save  this ass out.  But then my luck  will get another kid  and I'll feel bad  now to give him back.  He's got write-offs now.  I know.  Yeah.  You're a family man.  Don't give him tuna.  You'll spoil him.  I don't give him,  I give him cat food.  No,  you,  you want to eat  the fucking shit.  Come on,  give him a nice filet,  you sick bastard.  Give him some  branzini with the stripes.  Branzini?  That's what I would do.  With the stripes,  right?  Yeah,  yeah.  My father had a pet  17 fucking years of dog.  We gave him macaroni. 
[03:09:30]  We gave him pork.  We gave him maybe  a fucking thing.  And my father spoke  to him only in Italian  and the dog answered him back.  Buckety-buck.  It's the truth.  But you can't do that.  You can't give that dog  a piece of meat.  Give him a brush  with some peppers in it.  This dog was so fucking happy.  I swear to God,  when he died,  everybody cried.  Oh,  yeah.  17 fucking years.  17 years.  That's like a family member.  in the hallway  and the day we got the sink  in the fucking kitchen.  We had to go to the bedroom  in the hallway  for the sink. 
[03:10:00]  My father cried  like Jesus Christ  came down  and anointed us.  It's a party,  my Lord.  I mean,  we have an ice.  We have the sink now.  He said,  the water come inside  the kitchen.  Mother of God,  Jesus Christ,  God bless you  that we have  the pleasure of the sink.  I said,  if my father was alive today,  I'd say,  go get a bottle of water.  I'll kill you,  mother first.  Then I'll kill you.  Why me first?  Because your mother hurts you.  That's why I'll kill you first.  The water comes out of the sink.  You don't have to get a bottle.  They see the sinks, 
[03:10:30]  they say,  I don't know.  It's like,  they're up there.  It talks.  And you say,  I want hot water.  And it comes out hot.  We can't even turn  the fucking thing on.  That's why we got paralysis.  Turn the fucking sink on.  We got paralysis?  Give me more.  Yes, okay.  How about you turn your wrist?  I'll give you one more.  Get a little exercise.  This woman from Columbia  told me how to talk to my iPod.  Hello.  Yes, can I help you?  Yes.  Yes, I want to send something  to my granddaughter,  Hannah, a text.  Okay, say a text.  Hello, Hannah. 
[03:11:00]  I love you very much.  Okay, son, that's it.  And I hear,  hello, Hannah.  I love you very much.  So an hour later,  I call my grandkid.  I said,  did you get my message?  She goes,  who's you?  Who's you?  College.  College.  Who's you?  College.  A waste of fucking money.  A waste of fucking time.  College gets a $40,000 a year.  This guy here,  he loses weight,  made $40,000.  Yeah.  I mean,  that's all bullshit.  Where's the scientists?  Where's the people  who grow the plums? 
[03:11:30]  When's the last time  you had a plums?  The people that grow the plums.  No one.  See that?  Grow the plums.  When did you have  a fucking banana  that doesn't have brown in it?  There's no more  of that drive  in this country anymore.  No, because everybody  wants a banana that's brown.  Yeah.  Big black cock is in.  That's what it's all about.  People want color  when they get naked.  All I want is a cat like yours.  And lick my pecker.  That's what I want.  Fuck yeah.  Oh my God,  I'm exhausted.  A big black cock is in. 
[03:12:00]  But I love you for that  because, you know,  you leave him there  for two weeks  or two days.  What do you do  there in your 80s?  You don't gamble.  Play some black jacks.  Oh my God,  he gambles.  Yeah.  Why did you buy the cat  for the torch  and the poor bastard?  Leave him at home.  I'm going to get  the triple A's  and triple A's.  That's AFPCA.  AFPCA.  You're very smart for that.  If I'm cruel to my car,  you could call triple A.  Yeah.  I call triple A  everything.  I call everything.  You really leave him alone?  So here's what you do.  You put the food  in the corner,  enough for two days. 
[03:12:30]  There you go.  He shits for two days.  Well, he becomes,  you know,  Tom.  When he becomes a Tom,  then he starts fucking  your couch.  No.  That I want to see.  I'm going to cut  his fucking balls off.  You can't cut his balls off.  I'm cutting his balls off.  I studied balls  and fucking hippos.  You see what they do?  In Italy,  they use the cat  as a harvester.  What's that?  He pulls the truck.  They got these monks  of fucking cats.  That's a big fucking cat.  Yeah,  they pull the truck.  After another day,  they eat them.  Did you know that?  I didn't know that.  No idea. 
[03:13:00]  If you turn around  and you make fun  of the cats,  they'll come after you.  Really?  Listen,  I'm not making fun  doing the Second World War.  They were eating them.  I'm not being funny.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When you go to Italy,  they can come under the table  with their tail  and touch a leg.  If you say something,  they throw you out.  You buck with my cat.  They hold them  with great respect.  Every time you go to the ferry,  there's a big cat  at the front of the ferry.  And the fucking hair  is going through.  He's my cat.  He's no direction. 
[03:13:30]  And he keeps fucking pointing.  The cat's steering the ship.  The cat is the ship,  you sick fucker.  They didn't even know.  They don't know how to do it.  They train these fucking things.  That's why labor over there  is cheap.  I don't want you  I take my cat.  They pay people in cats?  That fucking cat  does everything in Italy.  You understand?  None of that.  We look at macaroni,  that's Italy.  We look at pasta,  that's Italy.  We look at this.  It's the cat.  I didn't know that.  It's all about the cat.  Listen, now I know.  They got a place called Ishka,  right off the port 
[03:14:00]  of whatever,  of Toronto.  They got cats that row.  They call them row cats.  What?  Yes.  And they fucking row.  They got boxes on their tits.  They got boxes on their tits.  Hey, Steve.  We got a girl on the line  that thinks Pat's hot.  Can you tell Pat that?  A girl.  Will you be able to hear?  There's a girl on the line  that wants to talk to you.  Hello, sweetheart.  Is that you?  Wait, hold on.  Here she is.  You need headphones.  Carson wants me on the line.  What?  What happened?  Sue, go ahead. 
[03:14:30]  I can't hear you, honey.  Hold on, hold on, sir.  Hold on, hold on, sir.  Hold on, hold on.  Pat's got to put headphones on.  Well, that'll be good for you tonight.  No kidding.  Jesus Christ.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Sam, will you help Pat  and stop fucking around?  Put the headphones on.  That's the goddamn thing.  They're broken.  All right.  They're broken.  Okay.  Hello.  Hello, doll baby.  How are you?  I'm sorry?  Listen, I'm hiding down to Florida  with my husband right now.  We're first-time callers,  but I'm, like, getting all worked up  hearing you cursing,  and I'm, like, feeling guilty  because my husband's Italian, too, 
[03:15:00]  but I'm, like, oh, my God,  that guy is hot.  I remember him.  Are you still as hot as you were,  like, a few years ago,  like, two, three years ago on TV,  or are you even hotter now?  Is this all you got to do?  Are you kidding me?  Are you in Florida?  No, I'm not yet.  Honey, honey, are you on?  I just left.  I'm out of there.  Now you're coming hit on me.  Okay, listen, listen.  I'm going to Mexico.  God bless you.  You're having a nice time this morning?  Hey, listen.  Well, Monday, the show goes downhill. 
[03:15:30]  All right, Sue.  I love you, honey.  Thank you.  All right.  One call in nine months.  Look at that.  The cat got a more call than I did.  She likes you.  She likes you.  She likes you, Pat.  Thinks you're sexy, that girl.  Listen, to think is wonderful,  but it's dead.  Everything is dead.  Let me tell you,  and I say it on the stage.  I developed it one time,  and your father tells you  when you're getting married,  you're going to go,  oh, when you have sex.  Oh, then when you're 70, 75, 
[03:16:00]  you can't do that no more.  But what happens when you pee?  You go, oh, oh, oh.  That's the pleasure.  I pee two, three times.  Oh, you'll have to.  I had a friend of mine died  because he couldn't pee.  He had $3 million.  I said, I'd give $3 million right now, Pat,  if I could pee.  I said, really?  He says, yeah.  I said, I got $3 million.  He said, I'll pee.  No, but I'm joking.  He died because that's...  Oh, my God.  We take that for granted.  Well, yeah.  We take that for granted.  They couldn't unclog him.  Oh, I get up in a minute of the night,  and, you know, I say I'm a squirter.  So I have a petition around the toilet bowl 
[03:16:30]  so I don't squirt on the floor,  and I need an extra fucking mop.  So when it's 3 o'clock in the morning,  you've got to put the light on.  Otherwise, you'll have it all over the fucking walls.  Well, yeah.  Then you'd think somebody was visiting  while you were sleeping.  In the old days, you could use, like, sonar.  You could hear when it hits the water.  That's what I like.  He said the old days because he's fucking old.  He walked right into that.  He really did walk into it.  I certainly did.  Because he's dumb, too.  I'm dumb.  Mold, I'm ugly.  I'm fucking out of shape.  Pat really makes you feel good.  You're lonely. 
[03:17:00]  Pat's a feel-good kind of guy.  Why do we put up with this?  Oh, yeah.  When?  Probably at 3 o'clock.  You're on that late?  Well, yeah.  What about next week?  Because you're going to have problems next week.  Yeah, next week we'll put on the podcast.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you'll be all over.  This is a great fucking show.  Where the fuck do you get this?  How many fucking times do you want to be heard?  I get that.  What?  Where do you wear this shit?  You're retired.  You're retired.  Whatever the retiring thing is.  Pat's like, I'm going to retire, but I live forever on the Opie and Anthony challenge. 
[03:17:30]  That's all right, but at least it's rest.  He says to me, nobody's called me in three weeks.  I said, that's retirement.  There's your answer.  He's waiting.  He can't wait to go to the fucking Atlantic City.  I know.  I'm not surprising him by a duck.  I leave the duck in the fucking water while he's coming.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Pat Cooper.  Oh, shit.  Anyway, this was a great morning.  I love Pat.  What's today's date?  Today is the 18th of October, 2013.  2013.  Yeah, yeah.  Plenty of work.  Tonight, tomorrow, yeah.  I just think tonight, tomorrow.  Plenty of work.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to get you heavy stuff.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:18:00]  Did you work England?  Never.  Yeah, because that's enough for England.  No, I don't know.  Everybody lose weight over there, so you become a fucking bore.  You're not doing a routine on your weight, are you?  No, not really.  Because you don't look bad.  See, you're cute.  Don't do handsome shit.  Thank you.  No, no.  No handsome stuff.  Not handsome.  You're cute.  All right, this is the show?  I guess.  That's about it.  We're kind of bummed out that you're retiring.  It's four minutes to, Anthony.  I love you, and I respect you, and I care about you.  Pat, I love you.  I love you when you come in.  You know that.  I love you, Pat.  I wish your cat gets a horny ass.  Oh, no.  I want to see the cat with balls. 
[03:18:30]  Cutting those fucking balls right off.  No, but you know, sometimes we tease you.  We kid you.  You found something which is nice.  You know why?  Because we look at you, and you say, this guy's going to want a cat.  Of course.  He's got a good fucking heart.  That's what everybody said.  What with a cat?  No, you're a very sensitive.  And now your wife's going to call, I didn't know you were that sensitive, Tony.  She called you Tony.  No, please.  Fuck her.  I did.  I did.  Good.  How much did it cost you?  Because it cost me a pretty penny.  Hey, Tony.  Fucking money.  You're sick.  Fuck. 
[03:19:00]  How do you want to do it to your money?  Shove it up your ass?  I'd rather shove it up my ass than give it to her.  I saw your ass.  I wouldn't shove nothing up your ass.  It's a fucking garbage dump.  Oh, my God.  Is that it?  Are we going to do it?  Yes, that's your own.  Pat Cooper, everyone.  Pat Cooper.  Pat Cooper.  Thank you, Pat.  Thank you, Pat.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Pat Cooper.  Why do we have him in?  He just fucking sells the shit out of you.  I love you, Pat.  Thank you so much.  For the next book.

Have to keep running back and forth.  Wait, what happened?  Oh, no, it doesn't count for beer.  Didn't that ban got lifted? 
[03:21:30]  What?  Yeah, but they still do that.  No, Barclays still does it.  Why?  Because they already bought the cups, I think, and they think it's a good idea.  Oh, great.  That's it.  I don't drink soda, though, so...  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  We'll get some cum put into a temple.  Bring don't cum in a baggie.  Travis carries a fucking glad baggie full of cum.  Stinks.  Old bleach pockets.  Is that it?  Yeah, let's go home.  We've got to take pictures.  We have a...  We can't play the line. 
[03:22:00]  What?  Oh, the line of the day.  The line of the day.  Well, we're not going to have...  We don't have to listen to it.  No, we...  We should, though.  We're bringing back line of the day officially today.  Netflix is sponsoring it for now.  That's all they need to know.  Okay.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Here comes the line of the day.  The line of the day.  It's like a battery car.  This is after O.P. and Anthony Live. 
[03:22:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, baby.  Yo, man.  What's up, Who Kid?  I'm supposed to be up here right now.  You're not supposed to be up here.  Why is that?  Because Ja Rule is coming up here today.  Is that right?  No, I did not know.  Did Ja Rule is coming up here?  Yeah, I'm getting the fuck out of here.  DJ Who Kid is here.  What's up?  It's after O.P. and Anthony Live. 
[03:23:00]  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number.  Crazy-ass show today.  We had Pat Cooper in here.  You know Pat Cooper?  Gangster.  He's a legend.  He announced his retirement on the show today.  Gangster.  He said he's not even coming up to do this show anymore.  What?  This show.  He said he's done with show business.  It's a wrap.  He said he went, and he's getting older, and he said his body told him it was time  to retire comedy because, first, he said it used to take him  one second to think of something.  Pat Cooper's a real quick guy. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  One second.  He said, now 12.  12 seconds.  So he's not as snappy as he used to be, and he's going, okay, I can deal with this.  Is he stupid now, or is this old age?  Dude, he was in here for an hour, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah, killing everybody.  And you know to hang in this room, you've got to be a Pat Cooper, you've got to be a  Mike Buschetti, you've got to be a human biscuit, you know?  He hit me on Twitter, actually.  Mike Buschetti?  That was hot.  We were talking about his tweets earlier today.  Oh, for real? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  He ends every tweet with, how are you?  It's like, these things go on forever.  But Pat was in here, and he was, you know, he's killing it, and he said that first he  realized it was taking him 12 seconds, where it used to take him one second to think of  something.  Then he goes, then he can't hear anymore.  So he can't hear, he said, years he hasn't been able to hear.  What?  Then he goes, okay, I can't remember things anymore, so what am I going to do?  I'm going to write notes.  So I go on stage with some notes, I'll remember all my jokes. 
[03:24:30]  What does he say?  He picks up his notebook, he can't read his handwriting anymore.  Get the fuck out of here.  He said he knew it was time to go, when he had to go to the audience, and ask them  to read, what does this say?  And he said at that point, that's his body saying goodbye to show business.  That's why I love this show, like, a historical moment like that.  He announced his retirement on ONA.  Right.  Wow.  It's a big deal.  Motherfuckers is crying right now.  Motherfuckers is crying in the streets.  Right.  Exactly who, kid. 
[03:25:00]  302.  You're on the air.  What's up, buddy?  Robert's professional broadcaster.  That's Larry.  I love this guy.  That's Larry.  He respects you all the way.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, mortal, the legendary Pat Cooper.  Then you have the P.S. de resistance, the cream on the clock.  Did you just call who, kid, the penis de resistance?  Who, kid, is your nickname penis de resistance?  I'll take that.  All right, the penis de resistance, the cream of the crop, which is now a double entendre. 
[03:25:30]  Hashtag.  Hashtag penis de resistance.  I like this guy.  DJ Who, kid.  No, mom.  What's going on, Larry?  What a chopper to have following the great Pat Cooper.  And DJ Who, kid, is here.  Broadcaster and DJ Who, kid.  DJ Who, kid, is here to make a big announcement, Larry.  I don't know if you've heard about this.  I hope you've all gotten the opportunity to see DJ Who, kid, DJ before, because he's at  a certain age now. 
[03:26:00]  Things don't come as easily as they used to.  And Who, kid, I believe you have a major announcement to make.  You're retiring, correct?  I'm retiring today.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm kidding.  Oh, thank God you're not coming out of the closet.  Oh, yeah.  Hell no.  Yeah, I know.  He's bisexual.  He's not gay.  My dick is too big to be gay.  Is that right?  Hell yeah.  Is there a restriction?  Because it's too big to go in the butthole.  Oh, that makes sense.  That makes sense.  Only for pussies, man.  What's going on, Larry?  I wanted to ask Mr. Kid, is he beefing with Ja Rule?  I mean, is that not my business? 
[03:26:30]  It's not my business.  Tell me it's not my business.  No, there's no beef.  It's just that my boss hated him for years.  I don't think it's continuous.  Well, your boss is 50 Cent.  Let's not let people forget DJ Who Kid.  Let's get that clear.  But I don't want any residual spasm happen if he sees me.  Mentally, he might choke me or something.  Right.  I mean, does he do that mentally?  Is that some Long Island medium shit?  I mean, you never know.  You don't.  50 Cent demolished his career.  He did.  I wanted him to see me and see 50, and then he might beat you up, too, Cent. 
[03:27:00]  Because of our connection.  Yeah, of course.  And that makes me loosely connected to 50 Cent.  And literally, he's next door.  Ja Rule is right now.  He's going to be next door.  Holy shit.  How tall is he?  He's shorter than your arm.  Is he about 5'2"?  I've heard he's very small.  Look, measure your arm.  Measure your arm.  Okay, my arm is about, I'd say, 14 inches, maybe.  He's shorter than that.  You think so?  Yeah.  He's about 9 inches.  His whole body, though.  His whole body. 
[03:27:30]  My God.  Well, yeah, for those that don't know, of course, DJ Hookin is 50 Cent's personal DJ.  Yes.  And many years ago, when 50 Cent was first breaking out, his first big kind of claim to fame  was that he had a big beef with Ja Rule.  Yeah.  He wrote a song called Wanksta about Ja Rule, I believe.  Is that true?  I'm so shocked you know all this stuff.  That's true, isn't it?  Isn't he like so white?  I knew you were black.  Well, he claimed that Ja Rule went to the dealership but never copped nothing.  Is that right, DJ Hookin?  Precisely.  Precisely, indeed. 
[03:28:00]  And what he basically did was he killed Ja Rule's career in that moment.  Yes.  Ja Rule had all this, he was very famous.  He had all these songs.  He had all these songs with Ashanti.  He kept making R&B rap ballads before Drake was even a thought.  Yeah.  Okay?  This was Ja Rule, and he was going,  You're so superlative.  Right.  Quite superlative today, DJ Hookin.  But what happens?  50 Cent comes on the scene.  Yeah.  He decides to announce Ja Rule is pussy. 
[03:28:30]  Is that correct?  Vaginal, yes.  Vaginal.  Oh, vaginal.  Vaginal is how we would pronounce that.  Excuse me.  And convinces the country of this, Ja Rule's career ends up ending.  He tried, and I'm going to say this, of course I love 50 Cent, he's been up here, he wrapped  the intro to the Opie and Anthony show.  That was hot.  I don't know if you guys listen, starting at 6 a.m. on Fridays, but the Friday intro is  wrapped by 50 Cent featuring Larry King, an original rap for this show.  Jaxter, yo.  We love 50 Cent here. 
[03:29:00]  Woo!  However, he tried to kill Rick Ross' career the same way he tried to kill Ja Rule's career.  And you interviewed Rick Ross.  I did.  With the monkey.  I did.  If you look on YouTube, it's one of my favorite interviews I've ever done.  Look up on YouTube, Sam Roberts, Rick Ross, because it's fucking hilarious.  Rick Ross is fucking hilarious.  Gangster, yo.  You interviewed Ross.  Yes.  The bouse.  The cop.  Now, that's what 50 Cent tried to say, that this rapper, Rick Ross, who took his name 
[03:29:30]  from a very famous drug dealer, was in another life a police officer, a prison guard, if you  will, called him Officer Ricky.  How's Rick Ross doing today?  He's doing okay.  He's good.  He's hot, isn't he?  Very popular.  He's very popular.  50 Cent did not manage to kill Rick Ross' career.  Depends on how you look at it.  How?  I mean, how could you possibly...  Rick Ross is on some of the biggest songs in the world.  I worked for 50 Cent.  Get the shit out of you, because I'm not trying to get beat up.  It depends on how you look at it. 
[03:30:00]  For instance, Who Kid looks at it from the perspective of an employee of 50 Cent.  Yes.  Because even though 50 can't kill Rick Ross' career, he could certainly kill Who Kid's  career.  Is that right?  Kill me, nigga.  Yeah.  Murder you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50 Cent doesn't play games.  I've heard that.  G-Unit doesn't play around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you carry on when hip-hop beefs exist.  Like, you know, Rick Ross, 50 Cent.  Ja Rule, 50 Cent.  You have to carry that on. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Is that right?  That becomes your beef, too, because you're part of what they call 50 Cent's crew.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you...  You're scaring me right now.  Well, we're trying to break it down for everybody who can.  I know.  It makes it seem a lot more dangerous when you speak in white people terms, right?  Like, it's like...  It's so encyclopedic-ish.  Right.  The way you say it, though.  When you say it, it's more like silly and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  When I say it, it's like, here's the facts.  And you go, oh, shit. 
[03:31:00]  I'm in trouble.  I feel like I'm in class.  I'm a stupid nigga in class.  Uh, Chris on Long Island.  Yo, who cares?  You're scared of the fucking Cookie Monster?  Now, what does he mean by Cookie Monster?  What does he mean by my baby?  Is he saying that Ja Rule is the voice of Sesame Street's Cookie Monster character?  I'm really shocked at your audience that they're very well aware of, like, the old...  Oh, I mean, that's the...  Old beef. 
[03:31:30]  It's very informative.  Like, they're making me remember those days.  Well, that's what 50 Cent did so well.  That's why he became this massive star.  Like, he's among the biggest rap stars of all time.  Very few rappers.  Even, like, Rick Ross.  He's very famous.  Rap fans love him.  They listen to his music all the time.  But he's not mainstream famous.  Like, 50 Cent is mainstream famous.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, 50 Cent hangs out with De Niro.  Yeah, that's it.  You know?  Like, 50 Cent...  But that's what he did.  He took this rap silly beef with Ja Rule that normally... 
[03:32:00]  Just has people like you trying to sell mixtapes and just gossiping, you know, on the corner.  He brought it to mainstream America, whereas me and my audience is now very well versed on the feud.  Very well.  You know?  And I'm here to inform the people.  Yeah.  The Cookie Monster thing.  I'm really shocked that that person do...  Why?  Was that a big thing?  I mean, it was big, but in our nigga world.  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  Very shocking.  Let me go to Jeff in Ohio.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, Robert, you are the true king of all media.  That's right.  The king of new media.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Who, kid, please, please tell me you're coming on Sam's show to announce your retirement from fucking white bitches.  That would be...  If that were your announcement today, who, kid, that would be a relief to all of us white men.  Well, I was going to give myself a year with that retirement.  You were going to swear off white bitches for a year.  You think you could do that?  There's still 32 more white pussies I got to get into before I... 
[03:33:00]  Oh, you mean you're not going to retire from white bitches for a year?  Yeah, I got 32 pussies left.  What?  Specific ones?  Scheduled.  Oh, wow.  In this calendar year?  Yeah, that's it.  That's amazing.  Once I fuck those 32 white pussies, I'm officially not fucking any more white pussies.  You schedule fucking white women on a calendar like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not a spur-of-the-moment spontaneous thing?  No, it's scheduled.  I see.  I guess your penis's time is valuable.  Hell, yeah.  It's not even with me right now.  It's not.  You leave it at home when you're doing press and things like that. 
[03:33:30]  It's actually somewhere in Midtown.  I got to pick it up after this.  You left it there last night.  A white bitch last night?  No, some Puerto Rican Arab chick.  Okay.  A Puerto Rican Arab chick.  Wow.  Very rare.  So be it.  Well, you like them rare, though, don't you?  I got tested.  I'm good.  Oh, good.  Excellent.  You know, we were talking about the differences in white people information and black people  information.  The way information is passed.  Yeah, that's hot. 
[03:34:00]  You're excited about it.  Word up.  You're excited about it.  All right.  Should I give you both answers?  Here is my thing, and you tried, okay, I have a text.  Do you know who David Letterman is?  Of course, yeah.  He hosts Late Night with David Letterman.  That's the white nigga right there.  One of his top employees, Justin Stengel, who also is developing a sitcom with Harry Connick  Jr.  I read that in the trades, hootkid.  That's right.  What the fuck is that?  Justin Stengel just texted me.  He said, I hope my wife isn't on that list of 32 white bitches. 
[03:34:30]  I've met Justin Stengel's wife, and she is indeed, she's a white bitch.  She's hot.  She is hot.  So, hootkid.  I mean, this is a guy who works for the David Letterman show.  Let me look at the schedule.  Okay, check.  He's checking his phone right now, looking at the calendar.  Just look for the last name Stengel.  I'm singing the Smurfs, too.  Or anything that's, like, somewhat Jewish.  I have a lot of Jewish bitches, too, but...  That's bad news.  But no, she's not on the list. 
[03:35:00]  The fallopian tube will not be...  Congratulations, Justin Stengel.  Congratulations.  Now, what I was going to bring up was about, you know, the information going in different directions.  Some information doesn't hit the white community.  You know what I mean?  Like, you're saying, you're surprised that so many of my callers are aware of this Ja Rule thing.  I'm very shocked.  Some information doesn't hit the black community.  For instance, and you credited this to the black community, but I don't think it's true. 
[03:35:30]  And I think black people, after you hear this story, if any of my black listeners could call up and tell Hukid that he's wrong and is, quite frankly, racist for attributing this to the whole ethnicity instead of just admitting that he's an idiot.  Nobody tweeted it.  No.  Nobody Instagrammed it.  Hukid walked in.  You remember we had Johnny Carson's lawyer on the show this week on Monday.  What was his name?  Henry Bushkin.  Is that right, Eric?  Yeah.  Okay.  Fucking embarrassing.  Henry Bushkin was on the show because he came out with a book simply called Johnny Carson. 
[03:36:00]  And it's kind of just a book about his life and time with late night host Johnny Carson.  So the book is sitting in our office yesterday and it's got a picture of Johnny on the front and it says Johnny Carson on it.  And Hukid walks in after he met Mike Buschetti and he was all amped up and he didn't think things could get any better.  But he walks into our office and he gets all excited and he goes, yo, man, yo, you guys got Johnny Carson coming in here? 
[03:36:30]  Oh, shit.  Where's Carson coming in here?  Yo, I got to get him.  I got to get him on my show, yo.  I got to introduce the black people to Johnny Carson.  And me and Eric and Roland.  Eric, man, is that a mute button here?  We're all looking around like, is he serious?  And we're all kind of looking at him waiting for a punchline.  We're like, you want him on your show?  He was like, fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah, I want Johnny Carson on my show.  I got to get him up here.  That's a great impersonation to be right there.  Johnny Carson never been on Shade 45, yo. 
[03:37:00]  And I'm going, like, Who Kid is really excited about this.  I'm going, Who Kid, I don't think Johnny Carson is coming up here.  And Who Kid's like, you got his book right here, yo.  I'm like, Who Kid, Johnny Carson didn't write that book.  Unbelievable.  And Who Kid goes, come on, man.  Come on.  You had Larry King recently, right?  He didn't write this book, come on.  It was too much.  I miss Larry King, right?  Right.  You had him up here.  We had Larry King up here a few times.  I was away, so I was so furious. 
[03:37:30]  So now I see the Johnny Carson book there.  I was like, oh, shit.  What were you thinking when you saw the first thing, when you saw the book?  I think Roland has something to do with this setup.  He always lies to me and tricks me.  No, no, no, no, no.  What is the first thing that you were thinking when you saw that book?  When I saw that book, because I saw the Larry King book and Larry King came after.  Right.  So when I saw the Johnny Carson book, I was like, oh, shit.  ONA is doing it big.  Right.  And that, because, you know, in my black community, a photo with fucking, you know.  With Johnny Carson. 
[03:38:00]  The guy who hung out with all these fucking guys.  The Sinatra, everybody.  Yeah, like, he's like the gangster, you know.  So you were hoping to get a photo with Johnny Carson.  Oh, I would go, I'll go down in history.  I'll probably be in the books.  Well, who kid?  I hate to inform you of this, and I informed you of this yesterday, and it was news to you.  And I thought you were lying.  I thought he was lying.  I thought Roland was lying.  I turned to who kid, I go, who kid?  I realized he was telling the truth, that he really wanted that photo.  I go, Johnny Carson's dead, who kid?  And he looked at me, he goes, no, man. 
[03:38:30]  No.  Oh, and I go, yeah, he's not, he's not alive anymore.  And so they caught up to me, like, you saw how sad I was.  Yeah, and then he goes, and then he just starts sucking on his teeth.  And then he turns to Eric, he goes, he goes, E-Rock, man.  Come on, man.  Johnny Carson ain't dead, come on, man.  And E-Rock goes, no, no, Johnny Carson's dead.  I thought he was dead for eight years.  Yeah, he sucks on his teeth.  Roland, man. 
[03:39:00]  Roland.  They're lying to me, yo.  Johnny Carson's coming up here, right?  And Roland goes, he's dead, buddy.  He's dead.  He's dead.  And then I asked the whole office, too.  And then who kid?  He goes.  I'm running around asking everybody.  Who kid goes.  I got to talk about this on my show, yo.  I don't think black people know Johnny Carson's dead.  I go, what?  Black people have to know.  And that's why there's black people listening there that are insulted by this insinuation.  First of all, black people don't watch the news, so it wasn't tweeted.  It wasn't Instagram. 
[03:39:30]  And who kid goes, how come nobody tweeted this?  That's what you asked, right?  Yeah.  And I had to inform him, who kid?  This man died eight years ago.  When Michael Jackson died, it was on Twitter.  There was no Twitter eight years ago.  Instagram, Facebook.  You know what I'm saying?  Twitter didn't exist.  It was on MySpace.  Twitter didn't exist eight years ago.  And he goes, I didn't see it on Instagram, yo.  No hashtag RIP Johnny.  What's up with that?  Just a typically.  MySpace told me.  God.  No.  That was eight years ago that this guy died.  You really didn't know.  There was no tweeting. 
[03:40:00]  There was no.  There was a huge.  Everybody found out.  Everybody found out through various, you know, means and methods.  Unreal.  But then he starts going, who kid starts going up and down the halls looking for, first he  was just looking for anybody going, yo, God, did you, he goes, yo, God, did you know  Johnny Carson was dead?  And everybody, everybody goes.  Bladder laughed.  He's just like, yeah, bladder, every, like, yes, I know.  Who kid starts searching for black people now? 
[03:40:30]  And he's like, I got to prove to Sam, yo.  I got to prove to him that nobody knew this shit, yo.  And he starts going, looking for black people.  Janitors.  Janitors.  Anyone.  Every black person he talked to, of course they knew that Johnny Carson was dead.  Of course.  There has to be somebody out there that just finally.  Like this, literally this show is the moment.  This is a bad show to bring this up on, but on my show.  Right.  I promise you there's going to be like millions of black people that didn't hear that Johnny.  Because when you watch cable or you go, you swing through the channels, you see Johnny 
[03:41:00]  Carson, you flip it.  But I thought he was still alive doing it big.  You don't even see his things on TV anymore.  They have like these reruns, but I thought maybe, you know, they're just showing, like,  you know, when you flip the channels, you don't really pay attention.  Because I'm going straight to Law and Order.  I watch Law and Order or Smurfs.  So you, or Smurfs.  You know, Scooby Doo.  I go to all them other joints.  Okay.  So you got to go through the Johnny Carson shit.  So something like with the intelligence level of, like, a seven-year-old.  Roasts and all that.  Right, right.  Roasts.  Right.  You like that.  Roasts. 
[03:41:30]  Roasts.  Roasts.  I see.  Now, and I don't like to be offensive.  Yeah.  But I looked at Who Kid that day, yesterday.  You did use the N-word.  And I looked at it.  Well, I didn't say.  I said N-word.  Yeah.  Because I didn't want to offend you.  You didn't say nigga, but you did say.  But I looked at you and I said, Who Kid, honestly, you are a stupid N-word.  Maybe everybody, you know, maybe people can call up here.  You are.  I said, you're a dumb N-word.  You're allowed to call me a stupid N-word today if you want to call up.  But if anybody out there just heard.  Yeah.  Especially black people who are offended by this.  Let me go to Calvin in Buffalo. 
[03:42:00]  What's up, Calvin?  I can't be alone on this.  I bet you can't.  I'm not Who Kid, my nigga.  Who Kid.  My nigga, though.  Yo, son.  You got to know.  Listen, B.  Listen, I know it was eight years ago.  I know, my nigga.  My nigga.  I know.  But you got to know this.  I got to side with this nigga Sam.  I got to.  Come on, nigga.  I got to side with this nigga Sam.  I got to.  Only on this one.  I'm going to give you a hint, too.  I'm going to give you a clue.  My nigga.  On the show, from 6 to 11, like 98% of these people, they talk about fucking dead. 
[03:42:30]  He's right.  Hogan and fucking, you know, maybe one other person they talk about.  Still alive.  But the rest of these crackers, they fucking dead.  They're all dead.  Come on, my nigga.  Come on.  Johnny Carson can't die.  White people don't stop talking about people after they die.  He knows Jesus Christ.  I know he does.  He knows him very well because he's up there in heaven with him right now.  Man.  My nigga.  Johnny Carson, big dead.  My nigga.  Big.  So you knew this. 
[03:43:00]  You knew even from eight years.  Now, you didn't just figure this out like two years ago.  A year ago.  You act like because they weren't Twitter eight years ago, they weren't Facebook.  My nigga, they weren't MySpace.  You weren't pulling hoes off of MySpace eight years ago, my nigga?  All right, Calvin.  I mean, obviously, who kid?  Calvin's offended.  He felt bad for me, too.  He felt bad for you, and he's offended.  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey, Samuel.  How you doing today, sir?  What's up, buddy?  You want to ask who kid?  Is he going to have Biggie or Tupac on his show in the future?  White people want to know who kid. 
[03:43:30]  Biggie and Tupac, will they be coming up here?  Ja Rule's up here today.  Extremely embarrassing.  Will Tupac and Biggie be on a future DJ Who Kid extravaganza?  Maybe the hologram, but not the actual course.  Are they dead?  No!  I don't think white people knew about that.  Kevin in Houston.  This is so embarrassing, man.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Who Kid?  What up, sir?  So today, Pat Cooper announced his retirement?  Yeah.  Thank fucking God.  Unfunny fucking old curmudgeon. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Listen, listen, listen.  I got other things to talk about.  Why is this guy disrespecting a classic nigga, man?  He's mad at Pat Cooper.  Come on, Pat Cooper's a classic nigga, man.  That's exactly right.  Classic.  Justin in Oklahoma.  Yeah, I was just curious if all the white people knew how white DJ Who Kid's real name was.  Well, I don't know.  I thought his name was Who Kid.  Nah, but real name.  What's your real name?  His name was Eve.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  Eve's the false law.  That's...  The jacoustah.  What's that, like, Crayol?  Eve's munged it there.  Yeah, he knows my real name.  Oh, this guy really knows my real name.  He's been stalking you.  He's a big fan.  Watch out, Who Kid.  It's scary right now.  He probably knows how big your dick is, too.  Gotta watch my butthole.  Yeah, watch.  Watch that butthole.  Who Kid, I meant to tell you.  Yeah.  If you ask any girl, and you ask, you talk to a lot of women.  Uh, Shizer.  Any woman, what the best gift she ever got was, without hesitation, without even thinking  about it, she'll always say, her engagement ring. 
[03:45:00]  Nah.  DJ Hooker.  Her engagement ring.  It's so important.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's not just a ring.  Mm-hmm.  It's not just a sign of affection.  Mm-hmm.  It's everything to her.  Word.  Every time she looks down at her finger, every time she washes her hands.  Wash that shit.  Every time someone at the store hands her change, you're gonna get credit, Who Kid.  Tinkle.  Every time she shows her friends, you're gonna get credit.  Word up.  Every time she does anything with those little paws, you get credit for that ring.  Woo!  So it's gotta be perfect, right? 
[03:45:30]  Hell, fuck it, yeah.  Steven Singer gets that.  Steven Singer Jewelers, they have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.  That's that nigga.  Steven Singer knows how important it is, and it's painless.  So many of our guys have made the trip to Steven Singer.  So what are you waiting for?  Hell, yeah.  What are you waiting for, nigga?  I've been there.  E-Rock's been there.  Opie's been there.  E-Rock's been there?  No.  Who Kid's been there?  But they threw him out because they thought he was there to rob him.  Word up.  And he might have been, quite frankly.  Just go online to IHStevenSinger.com or head to his store, the other corner of 8th and Walnut. 
[03:46:00]  Ah, shit.  In Philly.  With Steven's 100% money-back guarantee, you'll get his best service, best value, and the very best experience you'll ever have in your entire life.  I shit back and fuck up.  Right.  This is a guy you can trust with the most important gift that you'll ever give, Steven Singer Jewelers.  It's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut, it's on the phone at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-Singer, or it's online at IHATE-STEVEN-Singer.com. 
[03:46:30]  I'm so happy.  You talk about this guy.  Well, you're excited.  Well, I had to do something to take the pain.  Johnny Carson.  Yes, sir.  I really, yo, I felt sorrow.  I know you did.  You saw how weird I was.  I went to Starbucks, got coffee.  Well, you were shaking up.  You really didn't know the guy was dead.  I was like, I called people, I called a couple of my friends, and they were calling me a stupid asshole or whatever, but I think it's right that I finally caught up, though, because all this time.  Yeah, it's really, it's sad that you didn't know.  I was like, yo. 
[03:47:00]  Of course, you can hear Who Kid on Shade 45 every Saturday.  And I will bring this up this weekend.  I hope so.  I promise you.  And bring some clips.  If you have listeners that didn't know this, because this is like really obvious information.  This shit is fucking crazy.  If you have listeners that didn't know that that happened, bring some clips in.  I'd love to hear.  I'm going to give you an example of my show, because I aired Bobby Caldwell record, but a lot of people thought Bobby Caldwell was black.  Right, he's not.  He's as white and country looking like, and he hung people, but this motherfucking voice is very black. 
[03:47:30]  He's got the stars and bars on the top of his.  Yo, I shocked like 100,000 people that day when I played his record, and Bobby Caldwell is fucking white.  Did they start disliking him because he was white?  No, they were just shocked, but they loved the record.  It's a classic record.  Good.  Robert in Alabama.  Oh, my nuts.  Yeah, hey, I was just wondering if DJ Who Kid was going to be able to get Nat King Cole on the show next week.  Who Kid, you get all the guests.  Nat King Cole coming on the show anytime soon?  Jesus Christ.  How embarrassing was it when you... 
[03:48:00]  You see where you started, man?  What?  You see where you started, man?  What?  I thought this was going to be personal between me and you.  You brought this out.  I couldn't believe it when it happened.  Now I've got to walk the streets.  Yep.  I've got to do events in the free.  I'm not going to ask me where Johnny Carson's at and see the VIP section.  Well, you know what happens.  Every time you do my show, the streets start talking.  Do they not?  Oh, man.  Now they're going to know.  Jesus Christ.  You should call your next mixtape the Johnny Carson is alive mixtape.  The Carson resurrection. 
[03:48:30]  Roast.  Yeah.  RIP Johnny is what you should call your next mixtape.  I'm so happy that ONA's not here, dude.  To find out about this?  Or Jim Dorn.  Well, I'm sure Anthony's listening.  He listens.  Step on my face.  He listens.  And he will.  And Anthony's wanted to step on your face for a long time.  But he more is looking towards that scene in American History X than anything else.  Don't you think black people would be furious that I just figured that out?  Well, not only would they be furious.  Or they're embarrassed because I'm black.  They'd be embarrassed that you're black.  And they'd be even more furious because your first instinct was to say, well, just black people don't know about this. 
[03:49:00]  Because they're sitting there going, who, kid?  You know, you're talking to white people now.  You're supposed to be representing the race.  That's the plight of the black man.  You know, you are a representative of your people, are you not?  The nigga.  715, you're on the air.  Yo, what up, who, kid?  Hey, I've always been a big fan of MLK.  I'm just wondering if you're ever going to get him on or no.  Martin Luther King Jr.  I don't know if you know about him, who, kid.  I didn't even know what he was talking about. 
[03:49:30]  Of course you didn't.  Of course you didn't.  You're a terrible representative of your people.  That's the black guy that repped us.  He is a social leader from Montgomery, Alabama, I believe.  He's the one that went to the White House, right, with all the people.  I think so.  Okay.  Will he be on your show?  His people will, but not him.  He's deceased.  Oh.  I'm sorry to tell you that, who, kid.  I was on his block the other day.  Martin Luther King Boulevard?  I was going to rob.  I bet.  So, was it the corner of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X?  Is there a nice Martin Luther King Boulevard?  No, anywhere in the U.S.  You know why? 
[03:50:00]  Because they put them all in your neighborhoods.  There's no Martin Luther King Boulevard on a white neighborhood?  Do you think a white neighborhood is going to let that street name stay that name?  Can somebody Instagram me on my Twitter, at DJ Who Kid, there's a Martin Luther King Boulevard in a white neighborhood, and it's nice.  It's not going to happen.  And it's neat.  They don't exist.  And there's no drugs.  That could be your dream, Who Kid.  No gangsters.  No.  That could be your dream.  9-5-4, you're live on the show.  That would be my fucking dream right there.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:50:30]  I want to know if I can be on Who Kid's show.  It's Jimmy Hoffa.  Jimmy Hoffa is calling in from Detroit.  I knew he didn't get killed, man.  He's still alive, my dick.  Have his people call Who Kid's people.  Call my people, man.  You know what I mean?  And we'll set that up.  Because, I mean, there's great potential for something huge.  Jimmy Hoffa, they never found his body.  He's probably still alive with Tupac.  They never found him.  He's probably still alive with Tupac and Johnny Carson.  Did you see that special when Geraldo tried to unlock Jimmy Hoffa's vault? 
[03:51:00]  Nothing in there.  What do you thought?  Jimmy was going to be in there?  I don't know.  He was thinking some old laundered money.  For real?  Some kind of gold.  Maybe Jimmy Hoffa's body.  What did you say, Eric?  He thought, yeah, money, jewels, artwork, a whole bunch of stuff.  Anything.  Yeah.  I heard his nose is in the vault now.  Geraldo's?  Yeah, he left his nose in there.  I don't know for sure.  But maybe, like, you leave your penis places.  Geraldo leaves his nose places.  So 10 years, you'll find Geraldo's nose in there.  Right.  It's just a lot of weight to carry around, I guess.  I don't know why he let people know that.  It's supposed to be a secret. 
[03:51:30]  It is.  It is.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  I didn't pick up on this either.  We're both idiots.  It wasn't Jimmy Hoffa's vault.  What was it?  It's Al Capone's vault.  Ah, shit.  I mean, they're the same pretty much.  Sorry, Chicago, but Jimmy Hoffa, Al Capone.  Al Capone died of STD, right?  Oh, didn't he have syphilis or something?  I think he had, like, chlamydia, right?  Maybe chlamydia?  In his mouth.  Is that where it was?  That's where I heard.  Moisture.  Yeah.  Dennis, Long Island, what's up?  Spicy.  What's wrong, Sam?  Okay, listen. 
[03:52:00]  I love you guys.  You guys are great.  I want questions.  We're talking about all the other white folk.  How about Walt Disney?  Ah, that would be great.  He's got all these cartoons coming out.  Maybe you could talk about Pixar or something.  Walt Disney.  Maybe Steve Jobs at the same time.  He founded Pixar.  You could get the two of those guys in one room at the same time.  That would be terrific.  I was wanting to meet Walt Disney, man.  I bet you did.  You still could, actually.  Is he, like, in Platt?  Like, did they, like...  They say that they cryogenically froze his head. 
[03:52:30]  That's the rumor.  That's real, though.  Jerry in DC wants to hear it.  Because Jerry in DC, I know him.  Big fan of your interviews.  He feels like you get to the bottom of a lot of shit.  Jerry, what's going on, buddy?  Yeah, who kid?  I'm super interested to hear what you have to say to Trayvon Martin.  I'm wondering what he has to say about, you know, everything that happened with him.  So when's the interview?  We have.  I feel like you're...  And that's great, Jerry, because it's been a one-sided story with Trayvon.  It might be an exclusive interview.  I don't know.  I'm still trying to get permission from the mother, you know what I mean? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, we've only heard George Zimmerman's side.  No word from Trayvon yet.  I wonder why.  You know how you started, man.  You see how you started, man?  What?  And I also saw you get nervous, because you can't really do too many Trayvon jokes in  your community, who kid?  I'll get killed.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want Jamie Foxx coming up here, old man.  It's dangerous for you, who kid.  Yo, man.  Well, look how you started, man.  My Twitter's blowing up now, because of this fucking Johnny Carson shit.  You can tweet at DJ Who Kid, or at Not Sam, anytime you want. 
[03:53:30]  I'm going to tweet right now.  Is Johnny Carson dead?  Of course.  Please, black people respond.  By the way, I meant to tell you.  Big, big Sam Roberts show.  You want to talk about what DJ Who Kid's got going on on Saturday?  Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern, on the Sam Roberts show.  Wait to hear who I have.  Number one, I'll be airing some interviews from Comic Con.  I'll have Dan Harmon, the creator of Community, who had that beef with Chevy Chase.  I know what you're talking about, yeah.  I'll have Dan Harmon on.  But even bigger, one of the biggest guests ever in the history of the Sam Roberts show. 
[03:54:00]  Hit girl herself, Chloe Grace Moretz.  The new Carrie from the new Carrie comes out this weekend.  She's 16 years old, dude.  Relax.  If I was young, I would hit that.  I bet you would.  But I'm not young.  Chloe Grace Moretz is going to be in studio.  That's hot.  That's gangsta.  She was cursing?  She will be on the Sam Roberts show.  No.  No cursing.  She's only 16 years old.  But she was cursing in that movie.  What did she say?  Cunts.  Cunt is her favorite word. 
[03:54:30]  There'll be questions about her using the cunt word.  Questions about Carrie.  Questions about her going to Comic Con and charging people $100 for a photo.  Yeah.  I'll pay that shit.  You will.  What?  Chloe Grace Moretz on the Sam Roberts show this Sunday on this channel at 4 p.m. Eastern.  Did you ask her if she's a virgin?  She's 16, right?  No, I didn't get into that.  Okay.  Maybe I did.  You'll have to tune in to find out.  There you go, kid.  There you go.  Maybe.  I want to know.  Chloe Grace Moretz on my show, The Sam Roberts Show. 
[03:55:00]  Sexy, too.  Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern Time.  Hot.  I also wanted to tell you about Orange is the New Black.  You watch Orange is the New Black?  Yeah.  How about House of Cards?  That shit's crazy, dude.  Arrested Development.  Those lesbians are hot.  Are you ready for the next big thing from Netflix?

[03:56:00]  Funny motherfucker, too.  Big news for you, who kid.  And I'm glad your boss, Reef, is in here right now.  Don't tell him about the Johnny Carson shit.  Because we have a...  He doesn't even know.  Well, we have a phone call that's coming in.  Okay.  I just, before you take the call, I just have two words to say to you.  You're very familiar with them.  Yeah.  You're fired.  Okay.  Thank you.  You should be, after this one.  However...  Absolutely.  Because I can't even address it.  Yeah.  Because I couldn't keep...  How do you keep a straight face when somebody says something like that?  It's ridiculous.  But we do have... 
[03:56:30]  What rock of popular culture have you been living under?  It's a great question, but we have a bigger one.  Coming from a potential guest of the DJ Who Kid Saturday extravaganza.  Oh, shit.  Damn.  Elvis Presley in Graceland is calling the phone right now.  Elvis?  Tupac is on line three.  Thank you very much.  Oh, Elvis.  It's great to hear you here on the show.  Do you have a question for DJ Who Kid?  Great.  Oh, okay.  Love your work.  I was hoping to come down and be on your show and come on my new album.  Thank you very much.  You can tell it's Elvis.  It sounds exactly like him.  It sounds just like Elvis, though. 
[03:57:00]  Would you have Elvis on the show?  I would.  How do black people feel about Elvis?  Are you still mad about him stealing all that music?  He's a racist pig.  That's why everybody tells you.  That's why I'm a fucking bastard.  But it'll be on your show soon.  Yeah, it's okay.  Well, DJ Who Kid, thank you for being here.  I love hanging with racist people.  Yes.  Make sure you tune in to my show, The Sam Roberts Show, Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern Time,  here on this channel, the Opie and Anthony channel.  Chloe Grace Moretz on the show.
