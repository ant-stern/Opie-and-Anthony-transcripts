<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts introducing themselves with flamboyant, self-aggrandizing titles, immediately establishing their "shock jock" persona and disdain for "nice" radio.  Jimmy, a co-host, then detailed his nightly breathing problems, attributing them to anxiety and revealing self-harming behaviors as a result. The hosts speculated on potential causes, ranging from sleep apnea to general anxiety.  This segued into a discussion about a man decapitated on a Six Flags roller coaster after retrieving his hat, prompting a debate on Six Flags' responsibility and the safety of older rides, especially at Coney Island.  A humorous, yet offensive, discussion followed on historical gender roles and men's oppression of women, using suffrage and societal expectations as examples.  Financial anxieties arose as the hosts discussed delayed payments from XM Radio, labeling the situation a "red alert."  Listener calls and a few guests, including Kent and Robin, offered their perspectives and predictions.  Kent recounted a near-death experience involving a high-rise crane, emphasizing his impulsive nature.  The hosts reacted to news of a young model's death, engaging in crass and objectifying commentary about her appearance and speculating about her suicide.  They then reminisced about a comedically awkward scene from a *Quincy, M.E.* episode involving Quincy's interaction with punks in a club.  A segment dedicated to listener-submitted "F.U." messages followed, filled with extreme vulgarity and insults.  The hosts critiqued a newspaper photo of Scott Shannon, deeming it unflattering and the accompanying article nonsensical. Another news story, this time involving a man injured after exiting a storm drain and being hit by a car, was discussed. Audio clips from a *Mondo Topless* film were played, showcasing its descriptive language and humorous approach. The show concluded with a series of increasingly aggressive and bizarre voicemails from a man named Dimitri (later revealed to be James Sears, a disgraced Canadian doctor) directed at a woman named Oga. Rob was also mentioned as a guest. E-Rock's involvement in production was referenced throughout.

The following segment focused heavily on Dimitri's (James Sears') escalating voicemails for Oga, highlighting his arrogance and self-importance.  The hosts repeatedly played the messages, emphasizing their outrageous nature.  The hosts also discussed a listener's experience at the Gay Pride Parade, including snippets from interviews with attendees, discussing their sexual orientations, their families' reactions, and observations about the parade itself,  including commentary on flamboyant attire and what they perceived as a "gay accent." A caller shared an anecdote about Mexican Carl's Jr. employees intending to vote for John McCain. Listener calls continued, promoting an upcoming Opie and Anthony live show, and the hosts discussed movies like *Guess Who's Coming to Dinner*, *Network*, and *The Dark Knight*.

The next portion started with a seemingly random discussion of muscular men in small pants on parade floats, transitioning quickly to a pre-recorded segment of Sam expressing a desire to "kiss more guys." This was followed by mentions of planned segments including a report on cows named Black and Gus and a yearbook prank involving the replacement of Black students' names with stereotypical "ghetto" names.  A large part of this segment focused on sports, comparing soccer's popularity in Europe and America, a world-record 100-meter dash by an athlete with the last name "Gay," and the use of full-leg suits in swimming. They discussed a baseball game won without a single hit, leading to a confused debate about the rules of a no-hitter.  More audio clips from *Mondo Topless* were played, along with an extensive discussion of the high school yearbook prank.  The show featured numerous listener calls, interactions with a studio audience, and a lengthy conversation with a Canadian listener explaining Canada Day. Duff McKagan was mentioned as a future guest.  The segment was punctuated with off-color jokes, sexual innuendo, and frequent interruptions.

Duff McKagan, of Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses, was interviewed in-studio.  The interview began with sexually suggestive banter between Opie and Anthony before McKagan's arrival. The conversation centered around Velvet Revolver's tumultuous split with Scott Weiland, including a recounting of a chaotic backstage incident at a Stone Temple Pilots concert involving Weiland and the DeLeo brothers. McKagan discussed the reasons for the split, citing Weiland's difficult behavior.  He then discussed his time with Guns N' Roses, his relationship with Axl Rose, the band's success and downfall, and rumors of a reunion. He addressed the controversy surrounding "One in a Million."  Anecdotes about Kurt Cobain, Lemmy Kilmister, and Robert Plant were shared.  McKagan detailed his struggles with alcoholism and a near-fatal pancreatitis episode.  A significant portion focused on Nutsy.com, a music service he was involved with.  The hosts played a listener-submitted song for potential inclusion in Velvet Revolver's music, receiving negative feedback from McKagan and Anthony.  The interview ended with the arrival of a superfan, "East Side Dave," whose enthusiastic, almost manic behavior dominated the final minutes, culminating in a self-inflicted punch to the face and requests for autographs on a Guitar Hero game and a baby's onesie.  The entire segment was filled with profanity and discussions of drug and alcohol abuse.

The final segment with Duff McKagan continued in a similarly informal and digressive manner.  Topics included the band's early struggles (living in a storage unit), McKagan's dislike of the Foo Fighters, and further anecdotes from his career.  Nutsy.com was repeatedly promoted.  A humorous bit involved the hosts convincing McKagan to participate in increasingly outlandish promotional activities for the website, culminating in him nearly punching himself in the groin.  Other comedic elements included a discussion of poorly dubbed guitar solos on YouTube, impressions of Slash, and a running joke about McKagan's dislike of My Chemical Romance.  The hosts and guest also referenced McKagan's past branding incident on the Ron & Fez show, his new book, and the creative liberties taken in its writing. The segment ended with more chaotic and profane outbursts.

I'm sure I do  But do you know  When this started  Do you know  When this whole thing  Started my breathing  It was when  I had a tremendously  Bad cold  It was the  The series  The Yankees  When we lost  Three  They lost  Four straight  To the Red Sox  Oh yeah  Up 3-0  It was in October  Whatever it was  That was like  Two years ago 
[00:05:30]  Sue the Red Sox  That was when  These issues started  Sue the Yankees  Sue everybody  That was like a year  And I don't know  At least a half  Oh that was like  Three years ago  Oh yeah  Okay  That was when my breathing  Issues started  Because I had a bad cold  And my tongue  Wow  In my throat  I couldn't fall asleep  For more than five minutes  That weekend  Because I kept waking up  With my tongue swollen  And I couldn't breathe  And ever since then  It's been in my head  That I can't breathe  Why don't you go to the doctor  Get a nice checkup  What do they know  I did  I went for heart exams  What do they know  They know nothing  I did the breath test  Like 
[00:06:00]  Were you blown into a tube  Yeah  You feel like an idiot  And she's like  Yeah it's fine  She's like a tiny bit  Below normal  Because you smoked  For almost 20 years  But you're fine  Right  Alright  Quacks  How did you just say that  Bunch of quacks  Those doctors  Poppycock  Yes  Have some ST-37  My grandmother used to recommend  For everything  We missed some good stories  Over the weekend  I mean we can't be here  Every day broadcasting  We gotta like  Have some kind of  Normalcy in our lives 
[00:06:30]  When's that  But we got  But man  Two great stories  You heard about the dude  At Six Flags right  Great  If you're not him  In Georgia  Well you know what  F him  The guy was stupid  Exactly  The family will end up  Suing I'm sure  But F him  And F his dumb hat  That he was trying  To chase down  Was he chasing a hat  That's what I read  The guy was chasing a hat  At Six Flags in Georgia  He climbs over  What a fence 
[00:07:00]  Two fences  There's like  Signs all over the place  With those crazy warnings  Like danger  Right right  Restricted zone  Right  Restricted area  Restricted zone  Danger  Do not go any further  I mean they couldn't  Have made it more obvious  The 17 year old  Says screw that  I need my hat back  And here comes  The old Batman roller coaster  Oh boy  That Batman ride  Don't stop for anybody  And it seems to come  Out of nowhere  Doesn't it  Very quiet 
[00:07:30]  And then all of a sudden  Right  And there it is  It's not like  Old school roller coasters  Where you can hear them  Kind of shaking  As they're getting closer  Yep  That Batman ride  Is very very quiet  It's almost like a hybrid  Almost like a hybrid car  One slack  No I think that's  One slack  No that's six  Well for the guy  One slack  Yeah  For the people watching  Six flags  Six flags  More flags  More fun  Absolutely  Yes  You see a head come off  Man that's a lot of fun  How did that happen though  He was getting his hat 
[00:08:00]  And did the thing  Just came all of a sudden  And he was standing  Or did he try to  I would think he was standing  You ever see  You're on those rides  They come pretty close  To the ground  At certain points  Sure  And those are the points  That are all fenced off  You're not supposed  To be in there  I heard he was with a buddy  And they were trying  To get back into the park  Without having to go  All the way around  No  That's one thing I read  But that was  You know yesterday  So maybe they got more info  Oh you know what  And they said  That he couldn't fit  So he said  Why don't I send 
[00:08:30]  My head to reverse  A couple things  Obviously the guy's stupid  But secondly  Why do they make  These roller coasters  So low to the ground  Where you could possibly  Lose a head  If you wander off  Like that  Yeah I guess they figure  No idiot is going to  Go through two fences  With the warning signs  But there's a lot of sky  So why don't you  Just kind of make sure  Oh keep the thing up  Make sure it's not  Going to come close  To decapitating anyone  It's thrilling  When you like  You know  Come around that corner 
[00:09:00]  And it looks like  Your feet are going  To hit the ground  Because your feet  Dangle on that ride  Yeah yeah  You know  You're just kind of  Whoa  There goes my head  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  I'm scared of roller coasters  So the guy lost his hat  And his head  Oh  Victim of the morning  Yeah  Yes he was  And then they're saying  On the news this morning  It kind of relates  To this  This Batman ride  That the rides  At Coney Island  The famous Coney Island 
[00:09:30]  Uh huh  Are so dangerous  What do they say  They should be  Shot down  These rides  Should be closed down  Yeah  Shut down  Oh  It sounded like  They said  Shot down  Shot down  Well that would be fun  Right  Artillery  Just blow the whole place up  Well they got  What is it  What is the famous  Oh the cyclone  The cyclone  They said  You're crazy  To ride that thing  At this point  Yeah all those rides  Do you think  There's really  A maintenance crew  Going in there  And really checking  Every nut and bolt  That's been there  Since the friggin  30's or 20's 
[00:10:00]  Yeah  Some of these things  Were built  Right right  Yeah it's a  It's a hazard  Just the video  They showed up  The video they showed  On TV  You could see  The roller coaster  Kind of  Just shaking  Just a little bit  From side to side  But if it does that  A million times  Over its lifetime  Yeah  I think something's  Going to give way  Yeah  I don't call it  Coney Island  What do you call it  I can't really say  But I don't call it  Coney Island  Oh boy  Eeny meeny miny  Have you been there  In a while  You're going to get fired  I think  I'm not saying it  I'm not saying a word 
[00:10:30]  All I'm saying is  I don't appreciate  The place  Very much  Why  I know it's  A historic place  And it might have been  Very nice to go there  In the 20's  Yeah  You know  Where you could go  To the boardwalk  And see the women  Wearing those stupid  Bathing suits  And the men wearing  The full body ones  With the stripes  And the handlebar mustaches  The girls didn't wear  Bathing suits though  They were wearing  Like flowing dresses  It was like a dress  And then they would  Go up to their ankles  In the water  Holding umbrellas  Well yeah  Because women  Weren't known to swim 
[00:11:00]  No  You don't want them swimming  Because they would  Probably attract sharks  With that thing they get  That was the good old days  Every month  That was the good old days  When they were  Second class citizens  Right  Smoke that cigarette  I'll belt you  They put their ankles  In the water  And they went home  And baked the pie  Yeah  That's all they did  Back then  And talked to each other  About how great it was  To put their ankles  In the water  Right  With their big  Oversized hats  And stuff  We made them miserable  Men knew how to make  Women miserable  Now they make us 
[00:11:30]  Miserable  Yeah we were pretty  Good at it back then  Yeah the guy  You know  100 degrees out  Even though it was  Like you just said  A full body  Bathing suit  It was like a  Wife beater top  Kind of thing  But at least like  There was enough  Shorts  Skin exposed  To kind of  Cool down  And then you said  To your broad  You have to wear  That long flowing dress  With the big wacky hat  Yeah you wear that  In the heat  Yeah  Drop your fat feet  In the water  And contemplate  Your own prejudice  Go pump out

[00:14:30]  A girl at the Six Flags  In Kentucky  Had her  Both of her feet cut off  By the Superman rollercoaster  Yeah  She hit somebody  They're too low to the ground  Hit someone in the head  You watch  Now they're going to  All have to be a lot higher up  No it was somebody else  That was underneath it  That's what I'm saying  And they got hit in the head  But that should never happen  It shouldn't  Because you shouldn't  Be in that area  I get it  I'm a maintenance guy though  But humans are stupid  We always have to  Like go exploring and stuff  Exploring  Dude on Saturday night 
[00:15:00]  I was heading out  Of a restaurant on 57th  There's Nobu right here  On 57th  And right across the street  From XM  You know that huge crane  That goes up what  20  30 stories  I've been keeping an eye on that  My girl had to talk me out  Of climbing the crane  Why would you do  Why would you even  Contemplate that  And I wasn't even  I wasn't even wasted  Because the  It's supposed to be  Fenced in at the bottom  And it was fenced in  On three sides  But not the fourth side  And it was a quick  Little slight  Climb over  Like some scaffolding 
[00:15:30]  Really slight  Not anything dangerous  Right to the ladder  And I'm like  I gotta go up there  I gotta climb this  Crane all the way  To the top  Oh that  Shock jock  Plummets to his death  No I don't think so  Because it's all  On the inside  Oh sure  And she had to  Talk me out of it  I was really bummed  Because I'm like  Come on  Are you gonna drive  The crane up top  And start swinging  Things around  I just wanted to  Climb like  Like our pal there  That does it  You know  But I would just  Yeah but I would  Just climb a ladder 
[00:16:00]  I'm not like him  Where I scale  The sides of the  Buildings  But yeah  That's what I'm  Getting at though  You see an opportunity  You're like  You know what  I want to go for this  Sure  It was safe  To be completely honest  With you  I'm not even  Trying to act like  You know  I'm a tough guy  I'm George Willig  Or something  It was just that  George Willig  That's a good reference  It really is  For the old school  But no  I'm not  I just want to go  Exploring  And climb up this  Ladder  20-25 stories  That's crazy  It's not though  It's inside the crane  The guys do it  All the time

[00:17:00]  The Batman ride  Needs to be higher  Off the ground  Because there'll always be people  Not paying  A. Not paying attention  Or B. Following  You know the rules  I'll bet you that they have  Something blocking that ladder though  Like I'll bet you that  There's something in there  It looked like it was  Wide open Jimmy  No no I mean  I bet if you climb up  Maybe if I started climbing  Is it great or something  That you have to  Oh really  I'm guessing  You know what Jimmy  You have to be right  I can't imagine  It was that easy  Yeah  It looked that easy  But I didn't see anything  In the way  I definitely looked up  And saw that it was 
[00:17:30]  Clear sailing for a while  So  Oh maybe you actually could  But maybe like  20-25 feet up  That was it  Who knows  I just want  I just wanted to climb  Climb the damn thing  Let's say hi to Rob  On Long Island  Rob  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Yeah back to the Cyclone  When that first came out  It was so dangerous  That they actually had  A first aid stand  Right when you got off  The roller coaster  To treat people for whiplash  They had to redesign  The roller coaster  To prevent people's  Necks from almost  Snap it  That's the one 
[00:18:00]  On Coney Island  Right  Yeah  My grandmother  Took me on that  Really  You know the first  I'm sorry  I saw a whole special  On roller coasters  The first 360 loop  You know regular loops  On roller coasters  Have  They're almost oval shaped  To resist the G-forces  And the first one  Was like  In one of those  Train cars  That just was like  Made out of wood  And was like a perfect circle  It actually snapped  A couple people's necks  Before they had to  Shut the ride down  Nice  So they didn't really know  What they were doing  You know 100 years ago  Of course not  Now they pretty much

[00:22:00]  Jumping out of a building  Mmm  It's very hot  Well  You kind of get sad  When like someone dies  That's really really good looking  Why is that  Like if she was ugly  Because we're shallow people  But if she was ugly  And it was just some person  That jumped out of the building  We wouldn't even be talking about it  On the air  But when  It's just weird  When someone hot dies  You feel  You feel for that person 
[00:22:30]  What's that about  I think because you always  You feel like you had a shot  Is that what it is  Could have taken her out  And made her maybe  You know  Have a good time  Yeah  She couldn't make her feel any worse  Yeah exactly  See  You couldn't make her feel any worse  But it's amazing  Like why would such a beautiful girl do it  Like she couldn't have bipolar issues  Yeah yeah  She couldn't be manic  Or have molestation memories  She can just stare into a mirror  And go  Bah  I'm hot  I'm hot  I'll stick around a while  That takes care of all my problems 
[00:23:00]  It doesn't matter that I was diddled as a kid  Or  Yeah  Had a horrible family  Who knows what her deal was  But obviously  She was tormented  I'd have just laid out in the street  Naked  And hope she hits the right spot  Chief  What's her name  Ruslana  Korchenova  Eh  One of them  Korchenova  Right  Yeah  We'll pop up some pictures  On onaradio.com  I gotta tell you  Her model shot's not as hot  As just basic shots of her  When she was just hanging  You know  Hanging about with her friends 
[00:23:30]  And family and stuff  But man  But really hot obviously  This is the story  Here in New York  A model who graced the covers  Of top fashion magazines  Around the world  Falls to her death  On a busy lower Manhattan street  Police say 20 year old  Ruslana Korchenova  Died this afternoon  After falling nine stories  From a luxury apartment building  On Water Street  In the Financial District  The native of Kazakhstan  Appeared on the cover  Of Russian Vogue  In an ads for DKNY  Mark Jacobs  And Vera Wang  Investigators do not suspect  Foul play 
[00:24:00]  Wow  Of course there's no foul play  That's it really  It's very very sad  Because she's hot  Because she's hot  Yeah  I'm not even kidding  No  When you see like a  Like a teen girl  Dies in some kind of like  You know  Drunk driving accident  And she's hot  You feel really bad  Feel bad  For her family  If the person's a little ugly  Eh  Not so bad  What's that about  It's an instinct for reproduction  We uh  You think that's what it is  Like uh 
[00:24:30]  Our instinct says  That that's the most  Best part of  The best member  Of the species  Right  Or the healthiest member  Of the species  So we feel more for them  That's  At least what I'm telling myself  I'll take it  One step further  Eskimo girl dies  Drunk driving  Has that ever happened  Well  I'm keeping it safe  You just don't  Dog sleds hit each other  Yeah  No feelings whatsoever  But you know  A pretty white girl  White girl  Doesn't have to be white  I'm just saying  Eskimo and white girl  Oh 
[00:25:00]  That's all  You feel a little more  For the uh  A lot more for the  The cute white girl  That died in the uh  Horrific accident  Hmm  Interesting  It's just human nature  I don't know what  That's about  Wow  Look at that picture  Yeah  A little uh  Braun panty  Looking thing  Damn  Yeah  E-Rock just shut  The show down  By uh  Yeah  Popping up pictures  Of this dead model  Yeah  Fantastic  It was ridiculously hot  Or used to be  Ridiculously hot  Somebody said something  Now she's smelling 
[00:25:30]  A little bit  Oh  You know what though  It hasn't been that long  Oh god  You didn't leave her  Out in the sun  Did you  Get out of the way  From it  Yeah right  Maybe you could  Close the door  Sam he's climbing  On top of her  Uh oh  What happened  Jim C  Jim C  Do you know what  Happened with this  Russian model  Committing suicide  It looked like  She fell  Now  If she would have  Landed on her back  How flat 
[00:26:00]  Would she have gotten  Her whole back  And ass  Would have been  Pancake flat  But they know  She fell  There was grease marks  Smeared on the banister  Oh is that it  I love that scene  With the  With the  With the kids  If I could just  Talk to her  If I could just  Talk to them  For a second  Terrible  You're the problem  Man  We're just  An escape goat  Do we have  That audio still  When Quincy  Decides he has to 
[00:26:30]  Go to a punk  A punk club  And talk to the  Punk rockers  They're the worst  Punk rockers ever  They're right out  Of central casting  As they like to say  Horrid  Hollywood central casting  That show stunk  I know  Quincy stunk  And it was a huge  Successful show  That I remember  Watching and people  Watching every week  But it stunk  It really was awful  Detective Monaghan  And stupid Sam  And then that  Cheesy mustache boss  Would walk in  Homorotically look at  Quince  Rub his hands together 
[00:27:00]  With his OCD  You get anything done  Quince  And stare at  Quince's crotch  I despised him  All you really wanted  Was Oscar Madison back  Yeah  You know  It was like  It's Oscar Madison  And then he's there  You know  As the coroner  Oh  Here's Quincy  Funny  Here's Quincy  Trying to talk to the kids  At the punk rock club  I know this  This show is older than dirt  But it just makes us laugh  Every time  Because he's  He's just such a square  What is this  Like 81 is probably  Something like that 
[00:27:30]  TV era  Yeah  Listen to the punk rock music  By the way  Because they're selling this  Like it's a punk rock band  A punk rock club  It sounds like  Kind of the Allman Brothers  Or something  Yeah because they weren't able to  Like TV shows  Now  They just buy the rights  To music  And  Right  Bands love being on  TV shows  Back then  It was just  The musical director  The same guy that wrote  The opening song  Sure  He's the guy that has to come up 
[00:28:00]  With this rock music  That it's his interpretation  Of punk rock  Well because they want  To keep it safe  Yeah  They had older demos  Yeah listening  Watching this Quincy  So  You know you had the  Sex Pistols already  This doesn't sound anything like  The Sex Pistols  No  And it's supposed to be  A punk rock club  He's just yelling over the music  Yeah  Listen how fast it quiets down too  Yeah  Yeah  This is horrible  Wouldn't a punk rock club  Like not  Like quiet down right away  Throw things at the old bastard  Yeah  Yeah  This dumb members only jacket 
[00:28:30]  Maldahyde fingers  1976 for Quincy  Wow  Oh wow  Please  Can I be a test  Please  It's very important  Silent  Seriously said it's important  Very important  Oh okay  We're punks  But  Got sensibilities  Yeah  But no one's doing anything  During the music  And then it's just  Very important  Silence  They're all reading  Perusing magazines  Yeah 
[00:29:00]  What was the year on that?  Of this particular one?  Well Quincy ran from 76 to 83  So  76?  Yeah  I think this was right in the middle  I would imagine  Can we do a count  As to how many seconds passed  When he goes  Sure  Can I have your attention please  To the silence  Iraq please  We'll try  I trust you  Yeah we're gonna try this  But  Yeah keep in mind  Once again  It's a punk rock  Rock  Club  With punk rockers  Awful music 
[00:29:30]  It could be a riot  They're against everything  And you can hear him  Over the music  Crystal clear  Yeah  Please  Can I be a test  Please  It's very important  Less than a second  Three seconds  At most  From the beginning of it  No  No less than a second  When he says it's important  Abigail  God  Dumb fingers  Are all clenched  In importance  Yeah  Many of you know  Abigail  Please  Can I have your attention  Please  It's very important  Thank you 
[00:30:00]  How many of you know  Abigail Garvin  And all of you know  That the police are looking for  In connection with a murder  That happened right here  In front of this stage  Now all the charges  Against her  Have been dropped  She's innocent  If she comes back  Nothing will be done to her  Why should we believe you  If I knew who that girl was  I sure as hell  Wouldn't tell a cop  Because that's how you are man  It's a dog without a uniform  I don't care what kind of names  You call me  I'm only interested  In helping Abby  This is right out of  A John Wayne movie  No it's not 
[00:30:30]  There was acting  In those movies  This is out of  This is out of  A school play  I'm just interested  In helping Abby  I love the way  I don't care what you call me  Why would he  Why even address it  Quince  I don't care what kind of names  You call me  They call me names  In school  Sticks and stones  Can break my bones  When you say  I don't care what you call me  Guess what  You really care  So Quincy was really hurt  By the punk rockers  Call me whatever you want  Call me the queer coroner  Like they always do  Call me Sam's husband 
[00:31:00]  I wouldn't tell you  I want to hang out  With those guys  Of course  They're such punks  Oh they're dangerous  He wasn't killed  Dangerous  And then the one kid  Makes a statement here  Look  We have reason to believe  That she's with  Zach's real murderer  Molly Howard  And Molly is trying to  Push her into a  Codeine overdose  So please  If you have a hand for me  What  How 
[00:31:30]  She's giving a NyQuil  That's right  Codeine overdose  Abigail has a cough  And we think there's a plan  She needs Sudafed  Stupid Quincy  Quincy's an ass  She's been eating  Flintstone chewables  For three days  The worst threat  I've ever heard  In my life  She's giving a codeine  That's right  What the hell is that  It's an overdose  It's a sunny delight  And Molly is trying to 
[00:32:00]  Push her into a  Codeine overdose  So please  If you have any information  That's a crock  Mister  You think we're all  Zombie killers  You're the killers  You're a whole  Sick society  That's who's guilty  Man  We're just your  Lousy escape goat  Besides man  Who the hell cares  Dejected  Quince walks away  Walks off the stage  Because the punk rock  Yeah  Who cares anyway 
[00:32:30]  That was the punk  Attitude  Like you know man  Society  Can we find out  Yeah I'm just  An escape goat  Can we find out  The name of that actor  I want to see  What he did  After Quince  He must have won  An Oscar somewhere  And we just don't know  If this model jumped  He had to have  Filled himself  Oh please  We can only hope  Listen to him again  The acting is amazing  We have reason to believe  That she's with  Zack's real murderer  Molly Howard  Molly Zack and Abigail  Are punkers  So please  If you have any information 
[00:33:00]  That's a crock mister  You think we're all  Zombie killers  You're the killers  You're a whole  Sick society  That's who's guilty man  We're just your  Lousy escape goat  Besides man  Who the hell cares  We gotta find out  Who that guy is  Just walk off  Quince  Just saunter off  You failed  You're just terrible  You failed everybody  Quincy  You think we're all  Zombie killers  What  Zombie killers  Did I call you  A zombie killer  That's right  Did I call you 
[00:33:30]  A zombie killer lover  No I didn't  I don't know  If you're a zombie killer  You're not an actress  I want to know  Who didn't get these parts  Who else auditioned  Two shrubs and a rock  She's trying to kill her  With hot healthy  Cheerios  What  That's right  She's been dabbing  Kleenex under her nose  And shaking her brain around  It's funny to think 
[00:34:00]  That that's the furthest  They could commit  Is codeine overdose  Codeine overdose  You know  We gotta play the safe  Still you know  Who's ever been pushed  Into a codeine overdose  Pushed into  Okay  Little teaspoon  Open  Open  Open  It's just impossible  She's trying to kill her  With mercury  By feeding her salmon  Every five minutes  And Quincy is a complete ass  Oh so is Abigail  Abigail's a douche 
[00:34:30]  How do you not see that coming  Yeah  At least the mother  In Sixth Sense  Put some poison in the cereal  That anyone would taste  Who doesn't taste Drano  In a little soup  In some Cap'n Crunch  Let's go to Sean  In North Carolina  Sean  We think she's been  We think she's been  Taking mackerel  And using heavy equipment  That's funny  She ate a sandwich  And went swimming  In less than an hour  We have to get to her  It could be murder  It might turn into murder 
[00:35:00]  Zach's real killer is here  Abigail  And Mr. Schwartz  And other non-punk names  I don't know who came up with  Abigail  She has a crossing her eyes  And punching her in the stomach  Her eyes can stay that way  We gotta find another Quincy episode  That we can have fun with  We can't get enough  Of the punk rockers  They rule  Zombie killers man  It's your sick society  I'm an escape goat  And the other guy 
[00:35:30]  An escape goat  And the other guy delivers the line so quietly  Yeah but who cares  Who cares  He whispers it  Yeah who cares  Well that was the line  That got to Quince  He walked off stage  Dejected  Hands in his pockets  Go ahead  Go ahead  Play your punk rock music  Get back to your  Your punk rock  Easy listening punk rock music  He sounded like a jock  Talking over a music bed  By the way  Speaking of jocks  Can I just throw this shit off the subject 
[00:36:00]  Alright  Why is Rocky Dennis  Pictured in Hinkley's column today  No kidding  Oh my god  Is he awful  Stump brain used to work for this  This rock head  God almighty  Talking about Scott Shannon  I guess  David Hinkley had once again  Nothing to talk about  So decided to do a little article  On Scott Shannon  Yeah  Holy mother of god  He looks like Jeff McAuliffe  From Injustice for All  That is  They write me a whole bunch of talks  Put that picture up on 
[00:36:30]  ONAradio.com  For the rest of America  To enjoy  Look at his face  How is that funny  All it says is  They got a big picture  Of Scott Shannon  In the paper today  It says  Starting tomorrow  WNNJ  1360 AM  In Newton  New Jersey  What  Exactly  We'll pick up  The True Oldies channel  Programmed by Scott Shannon  Don't stare into that picture  Too long  Who gives a crap  That's frightening  Awful  Yeah what do you got 
[00:37:00]  Stump brain  Three quarters of that article  Is about another DJ  And there's no love for her  And there's one sentence  And Shannon gets the picture  In the middle  It doesn't make any sense  Because some obscure  AM station  In the middle of nowhere  Is picking up his dumb  True Oldies  And why do you need that picture  To tell you to listen  To True Oldies  God David Hinkley  You gotta step down  And let a younger guy  Write about radio  Here in New York City  That's finally actual size  Iraq blew it up  To like  Yeah  Ridiculous proportions  Old Easter Island head 
[00:37:30]  Yeah  It is good  Giant  Scary  Wow  Anyway  Don't stare at it  It's creepy  I can't  I can't look away  Why are you making it closer  Iraq  Like a car accident  We have reason to believe  That Abigail's been  Fed pop rocks  And her stomach might explode  Stupid Abigail 
[00:38:00]  Hope they found her dead  Oh me too  An accident that easily  Could have been avoided  On her way  On her way to see Quincy  Yeah  I don't know  This old pedo  Keeps calling me  I better go see him  Who?  The creepy guy  With the black car  With the dead people in it  And the boat  The guy that lives on the boat  The girl with the flat ass  Yeah  With the two dimensional woman  Yes we know who she is  She doesn't have a key  Just slide under the door  She's not even real Sam  She's a hologram 
[00:38:30]  By the way  Everyone's pointing out  That that punk rocker  Is saying  And we said it too  Escape goat  Escape goat  You gotta hear it again  Because it's just beautiful  He goes  Escape goat  Escape goat  Ex-scape goat  Yeah  I guess they didn't have  Much of a budget  For the punk rock  No they didn't have  A budget for anything  That show was so cheaply done  It did well in the ratings  For the time  I'm amazed  We have reason to believe  Listen for a scapegoat  That she's with  Zach's real murderer  Molly Howard 
[00:39:00]  Molly is trying to push her  Into a codeine overdose  So please  Have you had any information  That's a crock mister  You think we're all  Zombie killers  You're the killers  Your whole sick society  That's who's guilty man  We're just your lousy  Escape goat  Sorry man  Who the hell cares  Who the hell cares  Oh that was great  That's a crock mister  Does anyone know  How they were doing  The codeine overdose  I don't know  I gotta see that episode  One more sip Molly  One more sip  Here you go Abby 
[00:39:30]  We have reason to believe  She's a Zach's real killer  Molly Ringwald  And they're going  To sit on a couch  With their father  Harry Dean Stanton  With his robe half open  Why has that happened  How creepy was that  Talking with Pop  With his robe open  So do you love  This rich kid playing  His legs are wide open  Bag all over the place  She's red headed  With a dead mom  Stand  Harry Dean Stanton sack  Exactly  He doesn't know who he is 
[00:40:00]  He still thinks he's  Brain from Escape from New York  Why don't you nuzzle these  Sweetie  Good old Quincy  We gotta find out more  We gotta get more Quincy clips  Dude there's so many  There's years  He just sued or something  With Jack Klug  When he said he wasn't  Getting the money or something  That he didn't get any  Of the money he should have gotten  He should just keep quiet  He really shouldn't be  Getting any money  For that mess  He should get nothing  Unless he redoes them  Alright phone number  877-212-ON-A  We're gonna go to the F.U. line  And we'll continue  In just a bit  Stay there

[00:44:00]  Yeah  It's toilet cam photos  From his  From his  Flatties  To the bathroom  And he's  Toilet cam  It's on ONA Radio  Oh that's perfect  I know Stuntbrain  Everything's on  ONA Radio  Dot com  Yes okay  Hey  Cardboard hiney  The girlfriend  Ventured into the bathroom  And came out  With the paper under her arm  And Quincy  Couldn't wait  To get the pictures  Developed  Couldn't wait  To send her home  So he could see  What he got  Oh he couldn't wait  She was in the front 
[00:44:30]  Every time  She was in there  Every time five minutes  Would tick away  His feet would kick up  With excitement  Oh it's gotta be a good one  And by the way  I resent Derek  Saying that the more  I do Quincy  The more I sign  Like the guy  Who does Mondo Topless  No  Russ Myers  Yeah Russ Myers  The great Russ Myers  Not at all  She was a buxom beauty  Sam  We haven't played  Our Russ Myers audio  In a long time  We got a disc laying around  Maybe to throw in  Today  Can't get enough  Of Mondo Topless  Mondo Topless 
[00:45:00]  Even just the intro  To Mondo Topless  Is worth playing  For everybody today  Hey there's another  Head in the news  Another head  Well we told you  About the guy  At Six Flags  Down there in Georgia  Losing his head  Because he disobeyed  And didn't listen  To the signs  That were posted  Six Flags  More Flags  More foot  He climbed two  Six foot fences  Those fences  Should be higher too  What are they doing  Down there in Georgia  You can't  They're a bit trusty  Trustworthy  The fence 
[00:45:30]  You should just know better  I agree with you  Well we got another guy  Pretty much losing his head  In the news today  We got a twofer  We should save this  For tomorrow  Two heads  Here's the story  A Sacramento man  Suffered some pretty  Serious injuries  After investigators say  He tried to climb out  Of a storm drain  And was hit by a car  Let's go to Tony Lowe  That old gag  You see that in movies  Wow  It doesn't really happen  Coast is clear  Oops  A Sacramento man 
[00:46:00]  Suffered some pretty  Serious injuries  After investigators say  He tried to climb out  Of a storm drain  And was hit by a car  Let's go to Tony Lowe  As you tease this  Before we went to the break  And our police say  There were three guys  Who were drunk in the sewer  Yes  Sacramento police say  The 26 year old man  His 19 year old girlfriend  And his 24 year old brother  Had been drinking early Tuesday  When they decided  To climb down one  Of these  Bad idea  Because here's what happened  Police said  The brothers apparently  Had explored the storm drains  As youngsters  And they wanted to  Relive the experience  Now the three walked 
[00:46:30]  About 200 yards  In the drain  And then they tried  To surface  When the older brother  Was lifting a manhole cover  In the middle of the street  His head was hit  By a passing car  That's terrific  That's terrific  Ow  That's gotta be  That's gotta be scary  You know you're  Under the ground  And you gotta come up  Not knowing  Yeah what's up there  They should have been  In the sewers  In the first place  And they certainly  Shouldn't have been 
[00:47:00]  In there  Under the influence  Of alcohol  And again  I'm not exactly sure  What they were thinking  Pushing the manhole cover up  But obviously  Well what they were thinking  Was it's time  To surface  You idiot  It's time to get  The hell out of here  What do you think  They were thinking  It sounds like  They were pushing it up  Yeah  And it slammed down  On top of his head  Oh you think  That's what it sounds like  You know  You're kind of  Pushing it up  Right  And it like slams down  Oof  I'm pushing the manhole cover up  But obviously 
[00:47:30]  In a public roadway  There's a very good chance  You're gonna get hit  And that's exactly  What happened  Yeah that's right  The victim suffered  A skull fracture  Was taken to the  UC Davis Med Center  Where right now  He was in critical condition  Here comes the funniest part  By the way  Oh  Please tell me  He now has a big metal hat  That he can't get rid of  Trying to have an Angels logo  Put on it  Off to the side  A little bit  All fancy  Yeah  Like Desi Arnaz  Here comes the funny part  Critical condition 
[00:48:00]  The driver who got a flat tire  He's the one who called police  The younger brother  And the girlfriend  Were arrested on suspicion  Of being drunk in public  But a crazy  Sad story  Very sad  I mean very serious too  As it turned out  Not so sad actually  Kind of funny  Not sad  The car got a flat  Got a flat  I bet you that guy  Was really annoyed  Wow  You know the force  Yeah  That must have come down  On that guy's head with  Jesus  Gotta watch out 
[00:48:30]  You gotta have one of those  Little periscope-y things  That you can put through the hole  And look around first  Yeah  Like Mission Impossible  Or something  Yeah  Before you push those  Manhole covers up  Manholes  They'll always get you  In trouble  That's right  Coming at or going in  Exactly  Ladies and gentlemen  Just a little taste  Of Mondo Topless  San Francisco's  San Francisco's bulging peaks  And deep canyons  Lend themselves admirably 
[00:49:00]  To its own form  Of rapid transit  The surging  Swaying cable cars  Death defying  And rampaging  Up and down  Hill and Dale  Digesting and disgorging  Humanity at will  The beauty of Russ Myers  He's describing  Boobies right there  Yeah  But it sounds like  He's talking about  San Francisco  Yeah cause back in the day  You couldn't just  Describe Boobies  So he had a buxom  Babe driving  Around San Francisco  And he's making believe 
[00:49:30]  He's describing  San Francisco  With that said  Listen again  San Francisco's  Bulging peaks  And deep canyons  Lend themselves  Admirably  To its own form  Of rapid transit  The surging  Swaying cable cars  Death defying  And rampaging  Up and down  Hill and Dale  Digesting and disgorging  Humanity at will  She has fantastic  Rack too  They were all  Natural back then  Oh big and juicy

[00:51:00]  Art colony  Is dominated  By the arrogant  And imposing  Coit tower  Drusting its bulk  Majestically  To the sky  With the Broadway  Tunnel  Offering a yawning  Orifice  Through which to  Enter fabled  North Beach  What's he talking  About  Who's playing  The piano  Yeah  Little honky tonk  Piany  Being played  In the background  Oh he has  Worked up  This Russ Myers  Good stuff 
[00:51:30]  Very good stuff  You want another one  They're all really  Quick  San Francisco  A spumoni  Like hodgepodge  Of wild architecture  Harboring wonderful  Old world restaurants  And emporiums  Of pleasure  Exploding from dust  To dawn  With the way out  Craze of the topless  The way out  Craze of the topless  Of the topless  Yeah we know  That isn't actually  Russ Meyer  It's a Russ Meyer film  It's a film  Yeah we know that  It's the narrator 
[00:52:00]  I guess we did say  I'm sorry I  Yeah I know it's not  Russ Meyer is actually  Doing the narration  It's one of his films though  We've been trying to find  This guy that did  This narration  Yeah  We hear he's still alive  Somewhere yeah  Of the topless  Born and nurtured  By staid and stolid  San Francisco  And cut loose  To rampage  Across the USA  And even Europe  National publications  Such as Life  Playboy and Esquire  Have documented  The topless  The phrase  And the craze 
[00:52:30]  That is changing  The mood  And the mores  Of people everywhere  Why didn't that one stick  The art of the topless  Yeah  This sounds cool  Then Deep Throat showed up  Yeah I know  And took all the innocence away right  Yeah  The art of the what  The art of the topless  Enough of this artsy fartsy stuff  Let's get right to it  When a lovely shows up  Exactly  Mouth dives onto someone  Her arms behind her back  She impales herself on 
[00:53:00]  A slob  Exactly  The art of the topless  Can go take a  Take a  Flying leap  The art of the topless  Is that guy  At Six Flags  The art of the hatless  New hat removal techniques  That's right  Well a little later on the show  Six Flags  More fun  Less heads  More fun  John Furlong  Thank you Vince A  From Bayonne  That's the voice 
[00:53:30]  Of the audio  You just heard  Sure  A little later in the show  We'll do Mondo topless  The movement  Of the topless  The movement  Yes  We'll do that in a little while  But something that the Philly crew  Sent me over the weekend  It was making me laugh  All weekend long  And I heard  I gotta acknowledge this  It's just a coincidence  But I heard Laszlo  Played this on his radio show  This past Saturday night  Who did he  I had every intention  Of playing this today  On our show  So I just want to acknowledge that  But it's this guy Dimitri  He 
[00:54:00]  I guess somewhere in San Francisco  Here's the nice segue  Dimitri ran into this girl Oga  And Oga was really hot  And Dimitri wanted to  Like date Oga  Of course  So they kind of exchanged numbers  And it turned out  It's very obvious  If you listen to this  That Oga didn't want to  Have anything to do with Dimitri  And probably should have  Gave Dimitri a fake number  But she didn't  Oh stupid  So now Dimitri is leaving  Voicemails for Oga 
[00:54:30]  Whom he met on the street earlier  Okay the first message  Was alright  But he gets very nasty  In the second  So here's Dimitri  Trying to date Oga  After they met in San Francisco  Yeah hi there  Oga it's Dimitri  Sorry I had to leave  Such a rushed message  With you  When we met the other day  I just want to quickly  Give you my phone number  And I had to get the heck  Out of the area  In any event  I figure I better leave you  A more detailed message  And explain why I approached you 
[00:55:00]  I am single  I have no trouble meeting women  I mean women approach me  Six, seven times a day  How do you not love him?  That's what I'm saying  I couldn't  I've played this easily  10, 15 times over the weekend  The man is a fool  Dimitri rules  A complete buffoon  He's great  Can we have the  Can we have the  The douche blank bell  Everything that Dimitri says  That just gives you the chills  I know but  Let's start over 
[00:55:30]  Just hit that  When you just feel that  That chill  Something douchey  Yes  Yeah hi there Oga it's Dimitri  I'm sorry I had to leave  Such a rushed message  With you  When we  Who does he sound like?  And there um  His voice  Yakov  Smirnoff  He does have some kind of a  He sounds familiar  He's driving me nuts  I met the other day  I just want to quickly  Give you my phone number  And I had to get the heck  Out of the area  In any event 
[00:56:00]  I figure I better leave you  A more detailed message  And explain why I approached you  I am single  I have no trouble meeting women  I mean women approach me  Six, seven times a day  But I'm very particular  About what I like  You're extremely elegant  I couldn't take my eyes  Off of you  And your friends  Were very jealous  Even if they say  They weren't  They were envious  At the fact that  I approached you  And I was very taken  By you  Elegant women  Are very rare  I'm Greek 
[00:56:30]  And I'm very particular  About what I like  So I'm giving you  An opportunity here  I don't know if you  Pick up the messages  On the weekend  But I'm working  On a movie script  So I'm pretty much  Around all weekend  Doing that  I left you my number  416-918  Oh  Why'd they do that?  Nah  They got the rest of it out  But let's just take a break  This guy  Is a complete ass  Special endeavor  That's what we were  Oh okay 
[00:57:00]  Special endeavor  I'm looking for a date  I have no problem  Meeting women  Partickler  I think you say  I'm partickler  Partickler  Is that him?  That's Dimitri  Oh is he  Who's working on  His movie script  He's a catch  Everything is douchey  About him  He's trying to be cool  I'm working on  A movie script  Swarthy Greek  Yeah  You wanna go back to it?  I'm Greek  Here we go  416-9184  This looks like  A landline  And if it is 
[00:57:30]  You may not get  The message till Monday  But when you do  Call me  And then we'll  Get together for coffee  And chat  And let the romance  Begin  Let the romance  Begin  And let the romance  Begin  With coffee breath  Sweaty Greek  With a bad movie script  And coffee breath  I'm very particular  Partickler  Partickler  They approach you  6-7 times a day  And you just say no  And yet you approach  This broad  Yeah  And her friends  Were jealous  Yeah 
[00:58:00]  Because Dimitri  Approached her  Yeah  But he was taken by her  Because she's very beautiful  They may have mocked me  And mocked my heart  You look very taken aback  By my approach  And I hope that isn't  Timidness  I hope it was just  A little bit of  Shock  At being approached  So  Directly  Because I don't really  Date timid women  Because I'm a very direct  Very passionate  Very direct man  I usually approach  From the rear  Because I am Greek  It's very weird 
[00:58:30]  For me to come  Face to face  Without a handkerchief  Like Jeff Bridges  In The Vanishing  I like to meet women  At rest areas  And then bury them  In coffins alive  Like Sandra Bullock  What a creep  This guy's a ghoul  I rack very passionate  Very assertive man  And I want a woman  Who's very independent  And strong  So anyway  We'll talk about that  But I just wanted  To formally introduce myself  Now I have  I leave the ball  In your court 
[00:59:00]  You call me  As soon as you  Have the courage to  Okay Oga  Talk to you soon  Okay Oga  So  Courage  What a fool  A bit douchey right  Obviously  A bit  A bit  Obviously Oga  Doesn't call him  So now Dimitri  Has to call her back  Uh oh  And this is a little  Different than what  You just heard  Really  Oh yeah  Look at Danny  You like this  Dan  I thought it was great  I mean  The more you listen to it  The more it grows on you  And it becomes just  This  It becomes bigger 
[00:59:30]  Than it actually is  And this guy is just amazing  Such an ass  And I did some research on him  So I guess once we'll play the call  I'll give you the update  Oh yeah  Good  Good  Good  Hopefully  It was a great adventure recently  Here's uh  Here's more Dimitri  Hi there Oga  It's Dimitri calling again  The guy from the street  I left you a message  Several days ago  You said you were interested  Now here's the way  I work  I don't like leaving  Second messages  But I like you 
[01:00:00]  You're a very elegant woman  You're very attractive  But  Who gets the feeling  That this guy loves  Leaving second  Of course he does  Six messages  I typically would not leave  A 37th message  But for you  The exception will be made  You're a very elegant woman  Oh he's awful  This guy  Has no rapport with women  Women hate him  He's the worst  They hate him  They hate his cockiness  Yeah  That he thinks  He's so uh  Uh  Great 
[01:00:30]  That they just don't like him  And don't get in touch with him  So he's constantly leaving  Second and third messages  I would imagine that the women out there  Are loving this  Oh they hate him  Oh yeah  They have to be loving this voicemail  Hi Oga  You are the Duke of New York  You are a number one  He has a boob  Oga  Don't confuse us for desperation  Yes  Exactly  I'm not as  You are a dime a dozen  Right  Elegant woman  You're very attractive 
[01:01:00]  But  You know  I don't play that game  I know your friends tell you  Not to return calls  You're playing games  Like you see on stupid TV shows  So here's how it's going to work  It is now 4.30  On Wednesday  Now I'll assume  I'll assume that you've already left work  Because you know  Some people leave early  And I'll grant you that  Oh thank you  If I do not receive a phone call back from you  Uh oh  By 3 o'clock  Thursday afternoon 
[01:01:30]  You're dead  I'm no longer interested  And you can erase my number  See  He's now given the ultimate  But  I like the excuse he gave her  Yeah  You may have left work early  There may have been a power outage  Who knows  Yeah yeah  Some people leave early  There may have been a fire in your building  Where you all scrambled for the exits  Perhaps a fired worker came back  And murdered some of your co-workers  With codeine overdoses  Perhaps you're with Abigail and Zachary 
[01:02:00]  At the punk rock club  It's an ass  Demetri comes up with his own scenarios  For why maybe she didn't get back to him  Oh okay  Oh yeah  It continues  The problem with you and your whole sickle society  Society  I know I am the escaped goat  If you're interested  And you can erase my number  I don't play games like that  I'm completely single  I'm very intelligent  I'm great in bed 
[01:02:30]  I make great money  Believe it or not  I'm a complete catch  Yes  Of course  I'm single  And if you don't know what that means  Just think of hepatitis  Or the common cold  Or AIDS even  If you wish to  All of which I can provide for you  Complete catches  Oh is he an ass  It's up on  Iraq's camera here  On Pal Talk  Yeah  So I'm just looking at him  And you can picture this douche  This greasy haired douche  He's a god  Just talking about himself  Yeah  Like he is great 
[01:03:00]  He's wearing a suit jacket  Like a dark dark gray  Or black suit jacket  With like a dark striped blue shirt  But there's no ties  No  Open neck  Cause he is quite the catch  He's unshaven  We got Greg Brady's leftovers  From whack bag  He writes  I love this  Dimitri is an ass  He's apparently swimming  In lovely women  But has to call this bitch  Over and over again  He's already threatening  To break up with her  And they didn't even date yet  Here's my ultimatum  And making assumptions  About her job conditions  Right  You know  If I don't hear from you tomorrow 
[01:03:30]  Erase my number  And look out for the  Molotov cocktail  That will come flying  Through your window  I do not take rejection well  That's right  I'm very smart  I'm very intelligent  I make lots of money  I'm a creep  Catch  Catch  Yes  I've only been single  Four months  I had a long distance relationship  You know  It went a year  It's very tough  To maintain it like that  And it didn't work out  Very nice  There's nothing wrong with me  Matter of fact  I'm one of the few men  In the city  That has nothing wrong with him 
[01:04:00]  Wow  Wow  Just look around  Most of them have open sores  On their faces  Nothing wrong with them  I'm a jerk  This guy's got everything wrong with him  He's an ass  Wrong with him  So I'm giving you that  Three o'clock deadline  If I don't hear from you  You lose my number  I'm erasing yours right now  So you won't be hearing back from me  So that's it  Three o'clock tomorrow  Or you can just completely forget it 
[01:04:30]  Now I understand  If you've got other issues  Like maybe you're not playing games  Maybe you've had  I don't know  Maybe you were abused  In childhood  Come on  This guy is a gem  Oh he is a mensch  Perhaps  Perhaps you were touch funny as a kid  Oh my god  An uncle with whiskey breath  And razor stubble 
[01:05:00]  That's right  Perhaps you're staring down  At your patent leather shoes  Wondering what you did wrong  When everyone knows  It was not your fault  Yes  What a creep  Perhaps every time  You're a hiney hurt  You think  The bad thoughts  Perhaps it is only a hemorrhoid  But you remember  Mother making you kneel  In front of the plastic cross  And pray for forgiveness  What a jackass  I sure can assume 
[01:05:30]  I'm kidding  I thought it was going to be  Something innocent  Like perhaps you're diagnosed  With uterus cancer  Perhaps your dad  Or foster dad  Liked to shave  While you were bathing  Perhaps you had to sleep  With him on the couch  Please hear the rest  Of Doc's theory  I love this guy  Maybe you're not  Playing games  Maybe you've had  I don't know  Maybe you were abused  In childhood  Maybe your mother  Has cancer

[01:07:00]  That's right  Unlike you  Who has a mom  With cancer  That's right  And a father  Who couldn't  Stop putting his  Beard stubble  In her back  I will just  Continue to talk  This guy is an idiot  Perhaps you're  Listening right now  Opening your veins  In the tub  Back to Dimitri  Childhood  Maybe your  Mother has cancer  You're going to chemo  Maybe you're  Just a person  Who's extremely  Frightened  Or has  An anxiety 
[01:07:30]  Disorder  Maybe you're  On some  Medication for  That  I don't know  There could be  Another issue  Perhaps you've  Taken too much  Codeine  And you need  To be rescued  Oh my  Perhaps you have  A very flat  Hiney  And are being  Acosted on a  Houseboat  We missed the  Obvious one  Chris Knight  From Long Island  Perhaps you  Spilled the  Paint  Issue

[01:19:00]  And like a nice  Sky blue t-shirt on  I didn't want to wear  Like a black shirt  And kind of be a  Downer  At the parade  Oh so you wanted  To kind of add  Some festive color  To yourself  Yeah  And blend in a little bit  Yeah  A rainbow  I mean it was  On the looser side  But not super loose  You know  I want to kiss more guys  What was that?  I want to kiss more guys  You do?  No  That's a recording  From before  That's been edited  You're right here  I want to kiss more guys  See  My mouth didn't even move 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  I hear it  I hear it too  Well I hear it  But it's  Not my mouth  No I heard it  Coming from your mouth  Of course  I want to kiss more guys  See  No  Yeah but you  You're not talking  Over that  Well I could  It's just my timing's  Not on  No  You would have  Talked over it  Well  I do not want  To kiss more guys  Here's some audio  From the Gay Pride Parade  Sam and Cream Pie Jones  We meet Chris  Whose father's  Not really supportive  Yeah sometimes  They like to  Lie to themselves 
[01:20:00]  Really  Yeah  We're here with Chris  At the Gay Pride Parade  Chris what brings you  Out here today  Um  Just having a good time  Me and my friends  Plan a weekend trip  We're staying out  On Long Island  And decided to come in today  Are you gay?  Yeah  Why?  Um  Because I am  It's not really a choice  It's just the way I am  Do you feel like your dad  Would be supportive  If he knew you were here?  Uh  I don't know  He's a huge type liberal  So I don't understand  I think it's just me  I don't think he has a problem 
[01:20:30]  With gay people  It's just his son being gay  Might be a little upsetting to him  Wow  Yeah  Wow  Boy if that's not a great statement  Yeah  Guess who's coming to dinner  Huh?  Byrne and Tracy  Both played  Exactly  They didn't want their own daughter  Laying down with Sidney Poitier  All of a sudden  Sidney Poitier comes in  Poitier  Wow  Sidney Poitier  Comes in and  You know  Shakes things up a bit  If you watch closely  Hepburn's head  Is actually moving a little back then  And you're like  I didn't realize you started  In the 60's Kate 
[01:21:00]  It's not affirmative for once  Would you?  It really is moving  In that movie  Wow really?  Oh yeah  I didn't even notice that  By the time you see her  On a golden pond  She's almost  She's almost got herself  In gimbal luck  Gimbal luck  I was too  I gotta watch that movie again  Because I watched it  I didn't notice her shaking her head  I was too upset  With the whole premise of the movie  I love that movie  You don't cry when you watch that? 
[01:21:30]  Yes I do  I go  Oh  This is what the future's gonna be  He cries for the wrong reason  Yes  I cry  I cry for my nation  In a golden pond?  No  Oh  Guess who's coming to dinner?  Oh  Jesus Jimmy  I don't know  I actually cried  At the daughter's performance  She was so terrible  But I love him  What was the other one called?  A touch of  A patch of blue  A patch of blue  That one  And the blind chick 
[01:22:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Selena  The big line  He's a what?  Yeah  That was good  All right  We got  Putty  Always getting himself  Into a jam up  By being a black guy  Back then  Moving his hands  Yeah  But he'd get out of it  He'd talk Whitey into liking him  He was good in Blackboard Jungle  That was a good one  That was a great one  I didn't see any of these movies  That was just like his first one  With Vic Morrow  Young Vic Morrow  Young tough Vic Morrow  Jamie Farr from MASH is in that  Is he?  His real name is Jameel Farr  Blackboard Jungle? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah  It's from the 50s  Wow  I've heard of the movie  Yeah  I don't know where we're on  On this weird tangent  All right  Let's  We got another clip from Chris  From the Gay Pride Parade  So it's starting to look very overcast today  It feels good  Because it's been hot all day  So  What's with the  Okay  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  What's with the gay accent?  And if anybody says  There's no such thing as a gay accent  You're out of your effing mind  Why do guys have to take on this  I can understand if you want to 
[01:23:00]  You know  Be gay  You want to date men  Whatever  If you're a guy  What is with that voice thing  That effeminate voice thing  That has to  Come on  And it's all like this  And  Why can't you just go  Ah  I won't say it  Because you'll cut it up into a clip  But  But you know what I'm going to say  I think  I have a theory  Yes  James  Because  It's who you emulate  Like  For instance 
[01:23:30]  Guys like in Brooklyn  I mean they have that accent  But they'll emulate tougher guys  Who talk like that  Yeah  And when you're  I guess gay growing up  And you emulate guys  Like who are gay  That's how they talk  So that's what you emulate  Or  Or maybe because you want to be like women  You emulate them a little bit more  They're your role models  There's got to be a real answer  But do they want to be like women  I don't think they do  I think they just want to be gay guys  But there's this  That voice  That  That friggin voice  Alright we get it  You're gay  So you think they're putting on that voice  I  I think 
[01:24:00]  I don't think they're putting it on  I think it's something to do with inside  And that's just how you talk  Dude  I don't think they're putting it on  At that point  But I think at some point in their life  Early on  They did have to put it on  You're talking about  Well the flamboyant gays  Yeah  Now  They're putting it on the voice  Yeah  For shock value or something  Cause there are gay guys  That have to stay in the closet  You know  You always hear  Our sports figures  And this guy  And oh that guy was gay  And like Rock Hudson  He was  He couldn't wait to get to the shower 
[01:24:30]  After the game  Yeah  What's up with him  Right  But they didn't talk like that  I don't know  Maybe  Gay guys  You know  They didn't talk like that  Do we have someone that  Could maybe give us a real answer out there  What the hell is that about  That's a very good question  I did  I did encounter it a few times  Believe it or not  Oh come on  A few times  Alright but did you  So dumb to say it this way  Full speaking guy  That was down there  And was gay  Did you get that voice too  Did you talk to any of them  Did you get the flamboyant  Did you get the guy like Chris 
[01:25:00]  And did you get like a guy  That sounded like  Yeah you know  I'm a gay guy  And uh  Yeah  I've met people with uh  Quote unquote  Normal voices  Who are gay  In the past  I did not see any  At the parade  Ah  Yes  Maybe it's just fun  To talk that way  Wouldn't it be great  It sounds tiring  But no  Try it  It sounds tiring  If I got mad at someone  I went  Oh come on  Who doesn't want to be like that  All the time  It just seems fun  Come on ladies  Call all your guy friends ladies  Yeah 
[01:25:30]  Come on girls  Who doesn't want to just  Swish around for a little while  Of course  Pete's sake  All limp wristed  It actually seems  Looks fun  Well let's uh  Let's be gay for a day  Let's get more of uh  Let's get more of Chris  On the air here  Today so  It's not  Doesn't look like it's  Oh never mind  Do you feel like  If it rains  It's God's way of telling you  That you're wrong  No  Good  Good  I don't either  Good question  The question of the day is  Have you checked your HIV status 
[01:26:00]  Yeah I get tested  Every three months  I'm in a study  For HIV medication  I'm HIV negative  Excuse me  Wow  Wow  There's a slip  You don't want to  There's a bit of a faux pas  Wow  Every three months  What is this guy  Oh every three months  This guy's just taking so much  Every three months  Miles dude  Yeah  Miles if you add it up  They jump on his stomach  And then scrape the wall  Right  Three months 
[01:26:30]  Every three months  He goes around town  On a skateboard  On all fours  God  With his you know what  Up in the air  Come on  Every three months  I'm sweating for the guy  God  Cause I am HIV positive  Hold the phone  Wow  Every three months  What's that about  Better safe than sorry  Yeah cause I mean 
[01:27:00]  Believe me  Once it comes back  The wrong way  I'll never have to get tested again  Yeah  That's it  Might as well just get it  Out of the way  One positive  And that's it  End of test  Yeah  Alright let's talk  Well we get to meet  Omar here  Thanks to Sam  Omar  Omar  Who decided to  You know  Quote work  On his day off  Just meet some people  Learn about the community  This is Omar everyone  We're here at Gay Pride  With Omar  Omar are you just here  Watching the parade  Yep  Having a good time

[01:29:30]  Hi  Do you say Wally or Wally  I think Wally  Wally  Cause some people say  Hey Wally  They even say Wally like Wally  It depends on where you're from  Yeah  If you say Warsh your clothes  Then you probably say Wally  Who doesn't say Warsh  I gotta go do the Warsh  Where's that R come from  I make myself say  That's my favorite way to call it  I know you say that  That all the time  I gotta go Warsh  I'm a big fan of  Churlitt  Myself 
[01:30:00]  My grandma actually  Used to call it  The Churlitt  That's old school stuff  Nothing  I laughed  I went  Thank you  But I  It was a quick  It was you know  I didn't expect  A standing ovation  But I didn't expect  Only my friend  To chuckle an indifference  From the rest of the gang  Those people  To the office in here  Start laughing  Wally  Number one  At the box office  62.5 million dollars  I kinda wanted to see  That movie yesterday  We walked in  It sucks living in New York  You wanna go see a movie 
[01:30:30]  So you walk to  One of the five theaters  They have for all of Manhattan  You walk in  And you're like  Oh sold out shows  Let's see  Okay it's  Alright it's 5 o'clock  On a Sunday  Sold out shows  5, 7, 9, 11  1 in the morning  What I gotta buy tickets  For Monday at this point  Yeah  Wait you wanted to see Wally  Wally  Whatever it is  Wally  I'm a huge fan of Pixar  And I'm a huge fan  Of animations in general  You don't like those  Pixar animations  I've never seen one 
[01:31:00]  Jimmy  Jimmy they're amazing  And they got the adult humor  It's good  It's good stuff  You've never seen a Pixar film  Toy Story  I know what the characters  Look like  I wouldn't watch that  If you clockwork orange with me  Wow  Toy Story might be a bit dated  At this point  But when it first came out  It was amazing  It was an amazing animation  Monsters Inc  The storyline was good  It was like kind of  Adult material  But also for the kids  It was perfect  The Incredibles  You never saw The Incredibles  Nope  Monsters Inc 
[01:31:30]  Nope  Finding Nemo  Nope  Cars  Cars was really good too  I don't like the band  Are these all Pixar by the way  Holy S  I have the Ant movie  Only because Woody was in it  But I haven't seen that  Stupid Finding Nemo  Was good to watch  Bug's Life  I wouldn't know  There are a couple of those  That I'm like  Whatever  I like Toy Story 1  Toy Story 2 was alright  The Incredibles was amazing  Why haven't they made  Another one of those yet  I'm just looking at  The gay parade  They're showing  Some clips 
[01:32:00]  And it's just  You see LeBron James  In the front row  Anyone else see that  Oh god  Look at this old queen  Wow  Or lesbian  Can't tell  Whatever she is  Oh there you go  That's what we're looking for  And the anchors have to go like  Yeah looks like a fun time  Was had by all down there  They want to say  Holy S  Yeah  What a disaster  A shirtless man  With a peacock hat  Why sir  Why can't you just walk down  The street with like  A Yankee shirt on  He loves both syllables 
[01:32:30]  Of those words  Does that footage  Embarrass the gays  You think  Only the hard working ones  That you know  Keep it together  And just trying to  Lead a normal life  Yeah  I'd imagine you'd want  Like if you were gay  You'd want a parade  Of just like  Guys in business suits  And like  Just regular attire  That's right  You know  Might as well show the world  The flamboyant side  Of this whole thing  Buddy mine's a turd burglar  Oh yeah  Why are they always burgling 
[01:33:00]  It's gotta be like a pirate  I know  It's like  The other words  Are followed by things like  Pirate  Or burglar  Well they're sneaking around  In the middle of the night  Is that what it is  Oh yeah  Well a burglar actually  Would imply that you're  You're removing something  Instead of pushing it in for  My friend's gay  So I asked him  I'm like  Does it bother you  I said  Are you going to the parade tomorrow  And he's like 
[01:33:30]  No  They just annoy me  Because a lot of guys  Get bothered  Because it's so flamboyant  And it's almost like  Alright  It's fine that you like that  But it's like  You know  With issues like adoption  And gay teachers  Right  It doesn't help your cause  When you're walking down  The middle of Broadway  With a peacock hat  And nothing else  It's perpetuating  The stereotype  That they don't want to have  Because that stereotype  Keeps them from adopting  And getting legally married  In states  You know when the conservatives  Make a bunch of 
[01:34:00]  To do about legal marriage  Between gays  That's what they point out  Yeah  It's like  Wow do we really want this  And there's the peacock hat guy  They roll the footage  Roll the footage  Going after the motorcycle guy  That's wearing like  One square inch of leather  Well they just showed a grandma  She was completely gray  Yeah  White hair  She was probably  In her mid 70s  Then she had like  A multicolored mohawk  She had some kind of  Leather vest on  With nothing else underneath  And she was on a hog  Which is kind of weird 
[01:34:30]  A Harley  She phrased that  I was going to say  Which is kind of weird  To have a  Never been sitting on a hog  In her life  I had it all figured out  In my head  Jimmy  Jesus  I can't come up with one  Every once in a while  I'm tired  Jimmy with the steel  I'm sorry  I had it all written  And everything  You were dribbling  I thought you were  Bouncing  Oh not that time  I was taking it  To the hoop myself  And a mohawk  Were there bird owners there  Okay  Thank God 
[01:35:00]  The delay  Sort of scared me  Jimmy  Moving back to animations  Go see Ratatouille  It's on paper  Ratatouille  Yeah  Is that how it happens  When  Ratatouille  Ratatouille  Ratatouille  Ratatouille  Ratatouille  Shame on me  Ratatouille  Ratatouille  I like Patton  I'm happy to see  That he did well  Dude that's pretty damn good too 
[01:35:30]  I wouldn't  I  Kung Fu Panda  I saw that  Beat it  It was a good movie  Was the animation good though  Yeah  That one seemed like  The animation wouldn't be that good  It wasn't Pixar  Yeah  But it was  It was done very well  What's it about  It's about  Panda  Who  Because of some kind of mistake  Gets mistaken for some Kung Fu master  But he's horrible  He's just a fat panda  Can I ask you something  Yes  How long  Into the movie  Before they  They had the 
[01:36:00]  Everybody was Kung Fu fighting  Opening credits  Opening credits  Really  Oh yeah  I love that one  So he had a big fat bear  Got mistaken for something  He wasn't  Yes  He did  Where is he  I don't know  I saw a helicopter shot of him  Running around Jersey  I'm scratching it back on trees  You idiots  I need audio  Alright let's get back to Sam

[01:39:00]  Of your head  When you watch Network  Yeah  And you never watched it  Because we're used  To all the tabloids  And a million news stations  And reality shows  And all that  But this guy had a vision  Of what it was all  Going to become  I want to say 76  It was  Was it 76?

[01:43:00]  Both Bretts have had recent trauma  To their tonsils  I'm going to ask you  You are cut off  That is a good one  What was the craziest thing?  I just remembered  It was probably  It started raining  So old Cream Pie Jones and me  Had to go undercover  Yeah  And like you know  A whole bunch of people  Had to get under this cover  Was it a monster of rain?  Yeah I didn't see where you're going with that  Ah yeah  So when you mean undercover  You decide to become straight guys?  No  Undercover 
[01:43:30]  So what happened?  It got cloudy  God started crying  Yes  We got under a scaffolding  Trying to muster up a good flood  The old ark  It rained like it hasn't rained  In a long time yesterday  So it did  Somebody had to hammer some wood  And a few animals  Things would have went remarkably  Different yesterday  So we're under this scaffolding  Uh huh  And some guy  Who looked like  Tobin Bell  But thinner  With a couple of 
[01:44:00]  Probably lesions  On his uh  Cheek and neck  Interesting  Was just  Staring a hole through me  Was he?  Yeah  Liked you  I don't know  I don't know  But I  Do you think he had the ninja?  Well the lesions  Unless they were just  Yeah  He fell and scraped his cheek and neck  In small areas  I guess that could have happened too  Yeah  And decided not to eat for a while  Right  He's wore  Naturally  All right  One more clip from Brett 
[01:44:30]  Uh will you be voting for McCain or Obama?  Um I don't know yet actually  I've been thinking about it  I think Obama  Uh this weekend  I just read this  That Obama came out  And said that  Black people are more important  Than gay people  Do you think that's gonna affect  The way you vote?  Um  Yes and no  What do you mean?  What?  I don't like the other guy  So  Yeah  Okay well great  Thanks a lot  And thanks for taking a stand  Yeah  Thank you  I hope you guys have a good day 
[01:45:00]  He's like a cartoon character  That guy  Fruit man  Superhero  Hey uh  Just off on a slight tangent  I learned something about politics today  Because of uh  Good old stunt brain  Well he is  The educator of the program  It's in the news that  Um  Obama and McCain  Are fighting for Hispanic voters  Mmhmm  And stupid me  And I mean that  When I say stupid me  I said uh  I would just assume that  Most of Hispanics  Would go Democrat  Yeah 
[01:45:30]  And  Stunt brain actually says  That that's completely false  That what  Second generation  Hispanics are actually  More Republican  Than Democratic  That's one of the  One of the numbers  They threw at us  At a business seminar  That's saying  The second generation  Of Spanish speaking  People in the country  Are actually rising  Faster than any other group  And so economically  They're more conservative  And hence politically  They tend to be more conservative  Who would have thought that  I wouldn't have  Is that why  The Republicans  Seem to notice that  And they're probably  Stealing a huge 
[01:46:00]  Uh  Uh  Probably a base  That was taken for granted  By the Democrats  Yeah  Everybody seems to be  Going after the other guy's base  From a few years ago  And that's one that  Is in play  Sure  Kind of cool  Hmm  Not really  Uh  We meet  Jeremiah here  We're here at the  Gay Pride Parade  With Jeremiah  Jeremiah what brings you out today  Well gay pride  You have to come out  It's time to celebrate  Are you gay  Yes of course  Why  Um  Well because I like men 
[01:46:30]  That's fair  Uh  What do you like about men the most  I like men's penises  Yeah  Uh  Would you consider yourself  A size queen  A size queen  Uh no  I take all sizes  Alright  So you meet all kinds of fun people  You certainly do meet all kinds of fun people  Okay  Terrific  Well let me ask you now  If you  If you didn't know there was audio  Why were you just walking up to people going  Hi we're here at the Gay Pride Parade  They knew that  No because I'm saying 
[01:47:00]  We're  The two of us are here  Like this morning I would come up to you and say  What's up Jim  We're in the studio  I've never heard that from you  I'm kind of shy around you  I don't  I never heard  I just see you laying there  Like a little waif  Legally tickled  Sam came up with an amazing twist  He just  Is just  Admitting on the air that  Yeah he was down there for pleasure  Just to hang out  Like  Yeah  Well I mean you know  For work  Yeah  Yeah  Here's more  Jeremiah  Do you prefer bears or twinks  Bears  Our executive producer is a bear 
[01:47:30]  His name is Steve C  I think he's active in the community  Have you ever heard of him  I haven't no  He runs a website that's impossible to navigate  Do you think that's a problem playing the gay community  Or is it just him  Impossibly navigated websites  Yeah  I think it's a universal issue  I don't think it has a sexuality  Do you think that's  We finally got that question answered  Yeah  Yeah  Let's go to Deanna in California  Deanna  How are you  I'm alright  Hey I wanted to tell you  I was working  I used to work at the Carl's Jr. 
[01:48:00]  Across the street from my house  And it's all Mexicans who work there  And I asked them  Who they were going to vote for  This was before the whole Hillary and Obama decision  Became  You know  Got finalized  And I asked them who they would vote for  And they were all like  Well  You know  They can't vote  But I was like  Well if you could  Who would you vote for  And they said  That they would all vote for McCain  Because McCain  Is for Mexicans  Like he wants Mexicans to become citizens  You know  The illegal immigrants  That's why  They all want to vote for him  That's interesting 
[01:48:30]  Not really  Not really  I got my new catchphrase  Jeremiah answers the difficult questions  Okay  Great  Great  Great  Have you ever been pink stocked?  No  Good  I'm not sure what that means  Well it's probably better that way  And finally  The question of the day is  Have you checked your HIV status?  Not lately  What would you assume?  Positive or negative?  Negative  Fantastic  Congratulations  Thank you very much  Congratulations 
[01:49:00]  You must be safe  That's like  That's like  Going to like a black parade  And going  So  Chicken or watermelon?  Really?  I know  That's terrible  Sam's got a little niche for himself  He's good with that on the street stuff  Yeah  Because I walked  When I was walking to the office  There was a big giant float that says  Know your status  Okay  And so I figured that's got to be the question on everybody's mind  It's fair game to ask the question  Yeah  If it's a big float  Very good Sam  I like how a lot of the gay gentlemen said 
[01:49:30]  Well I was born this way  Yeah  So I guess  Because a lot of people  The nature versus nurture thing  A lot of straight people that argue it  You know  It's split down the middle  But it seems like the gay people all think  That they were just born that way  I got to the bottom of it  I bet you did  How?  By asking the questions  You just heard  Oh okay  Yeah  Thank you  I talked to someone about that  That we used to know back in the day  And he goes  You think I would have chose this? 
[01:50:00]  It's an effing nightmare  He said  To me  Really?  Yeah  Because it's an effing nightmare  Why would I  Why would I choose this?  So grab a girl  Huh?  Just grab a girl  Do a do-si-do  Hang out  Hang out with girls  Have sex with them  Put your left leg in  Because that's the only thing that will stay hard  This person said  That we were having a  A company party  And he said 
[01:50:30]  That he  You know  Would never bring his  His boyfriend  To the company party  He would  He has to do a lot of these things  Single  Because people  Wouldn't accept him  You know  If he  If he did that  Because it's a complete nightmare  I can't bring who I want  To the party  So I have to go single  It's amazing  Like even  Especially in  Entertainment  Nobody cares  Maybe because he's in the business  But  Like on the sales side  Or whatever  But nobody  Well you know who I'm talking about  Oh yeah of course  I don't want to blow up his spot  But you know  You know  I felt bad for the guy 
[01:51:00]  To be honest with you  Of course  You know  Any other final thoughts there  Young Sam  Well whatever company  Makes tiny little spandex  Tidy whities  Had a good day yesterday  They saw their stock  Go up a bit  Oh yeah  Could you see  Could you see shapes  And stuff in them  Well they were  Very muscular people  On these floats  And they had very small  Small  Small  Pants on  And you could see  Some shapes  Oh really 
[01:51:30]  Yes  Did you look away  Yeah  Of course  Yes  Somewhat  Alright Sam  I want to kiss more guys  That wasn't me  For the audience at home  Nope  That was a recording  Of course it's a recording  Of you  Well it was edited  I think  I hope  Even if it was a recording  Even if it was a recording  Yeah exactly  Edited recording for the radio  Oh okay  See I'm not a gay guy  That was created in post  Alright listen  Here we go  When we get back  I want to kiss more guys  Well we could do that 
[01:52:00]  If you'd like Sam  How much blank do you need  How much blank does one man need  Zero is my answer  Yeah okay  Where's Jess  Huh  I don't know  It worked  Yeah alright  Hey when we get back  We got a reporter  Reporting on the  Black and Gus cows  The what  Couple cows named  Black and Gus  Or we could do  The yearbook prank  Where they replace  Black student names  With ghetto names  Oh boy 
[01:52:30]  Who thought  That was going to be  A good idea  That could be a problem  Black and Gus  Huh  Yeah  Hmm  A few other things  Oh and some more  Mondo topless clips  Yeah  Opie and Anthony  I want to kiss more guys  Jesus  Got a pretty good one  For a Monday  Opie and Anthony  What else is going on  In the world  Oh for the soccer fans  Out there  Just an acknowledgement  Spain beat Germany  To win the European  Championship  Any  Yeah this country 
[01:53:00]  We don't really care  Anthony made  Hooliganism  Anthony made a comment  About the goal  You could literally  Drive a truck through it  Yeah  It's the goal in soccer  It's like  Oh wow  They got to pick  They kicked it  Past the goalie  Yeah  Yeah  I could drive a truck  In there  And it's still  One to nothing  Every game is  One to nothing  Because you gotta  Run a half mile  Kicking the ball  To the other end 
[01:53:30]  Of the field  By the time you  Get closer  You're exhausted  You're just tired  You're tuckered out  And somebody else  Is down there  And they kick it  Away from you  And now he's gotta  Go the half mile  He should have to  Kick it off something  Oh like a bank shot  Oh no like a person  Like Terry Schiavo  Or somebody like that  Just put some  Yeah  Soccer is the  The strangest sport though  Because if  If you go downtown  In Manhattan  And you walk around  Down there  There's some of these  Pubs  That show like  The soccer  Not only are the  Places packed indoors  Inside  At 11am in the morning 
[01:54:00]  Because of the  Satellite time  Whatever  You got people  Like on their  Tippy toes  Outside the pubs  Trying to get a  Peek of the  Soccer games  I don't get it  And then as  Americans  We're like  Soccer  Whatever  But I mean  Their fans are like  Very dedicated  Very loyal  Never really  Caught on here  They keep trying  To  Every few years  They really make  A push  One of the  Teams will  Acquire one of  Those big  Soccer stars  From Europe  And no one 
[01:54:30]  Cares  No one  Cares  David Beckham  People like  Yeah and he  Couldn't do  Anything  I think when  Pele was playing  That was like  The peak of  America's interest  In soccer  Yeah  He just got  Mugged  Pele got  Mugged  Yeah he did  Ten guys  At gunpoint  Stole his watch  I mean they  Didn't hurt him  Ten guys  He's in Brazil  Oh okay  Where he's  Basically he's  God  He's basically  God in Brazil  The poorest of  The poor  Wouldn't touch him  In Brazil  Those five guys  If people got  Their hands on  Those guys  They would probably 
[01:55:00]  Kill them with  They'd probably  Rip their limbs  Right off  Yeah  Yeah he is like  What do they call him  A national treasure  Or something like that  In Brazil  Something like that  He was traveling  When he was playing  Or maybe he had  Retired  But to some country  He's so well respected  There was a civil war  Going on  And they stopped  Their civil war  They had a ceasefire  For a day  Out of respect  For Pele's  Silly countries  Yeah  But I mean that's how  Much of a hero  He is to people  It's amazing  Now Ronaldo's my hero  Is he getting busted  With trannies  How do you not love him  I love that naughty 
[01:55:30]  Ronaldo  Isn't he like  Naughty naughty  Ronaldo  Isn't he the biggest  Soccer star  Or whatever  Yeah  Yeah and then  In other news  Some gay guy  What set a world record  In the 100 meter  Dash  His name is gay  Oh his name's gay  Oh  Oh see  What's his name  His last name was gay  Oh  And at the Olympic trials  He did break  A world record  What makes his  What makes his  Last name gay  What is it  Sucker  What's his name  Joe  Blank sucker  What makes his  Last name gay  It just is gay  Or how does he  Actually take the baton  From the guy behind him 
[01:56:00]  What  No hands  And I'm still winning  But you're not  Answering the question  It is gay  So what's the name  That makes it a gay name  Yes it's spelled  G-A-Y  Thanks  His name is gay  He's a gay guy  What's his  What's his first name  I have to look that up  Real  Yeah  Completely  Sort of  We wish he wasn't  I'm not  What's his  What's his real name  He didn't get the record though  Because it was windy  But he did recently  Or something  No he 
[01:56:30]  He would have gotten it  Had there not been  A nine mile an hour  Tailwind  So they took the record  Away from him  Oh I see  So it was the fastest ever  But they have to factor  In the wind  Yeah  Which is so stupid  Tyson gay  Tyson's gay  Tyson gay  9.6800 meter dash  Yeah  Big deal  Who hasn't done that  And what's going on  With the swimming  Why are they wearing  Like pants in the pool  I saw that on TV today  Because you know  We gotta start talking  Like about some of these sports  Because you got the Olympics  Right around the corner  But there's a new thing  Going on in swimming  Where they're wearing 
[01:57:00]  Long pants in the pool  Yeah they created a  They created what's like  A shark skin  So that the guys  Slip through the water faster  And the women  Wear the suit  But the men  Don't wear the speedos anymore  They wear almost  Three quarter leg  It's almost like  It's almost like  Capri pants or something  In the pool  But it helps them get  Through the water even faster  Well it's that length  It's like  Just half calf or something  I don't know  But it's  Supposedly the scales on this  And it makes them swim faster  And they're all like  Destroying world records  It doesn't seem too fair 
[01:57:30]  Now does it  How about little  Motorboat things  Don't jump in  It's on your  Heels  The Olympic  Propellers  The Olympic committee  Should just come out  With a ruling  That all this isn't fair  And make everyone  Just swim nude  Yeah  And if you got a big  And if you got a big unit  Well it sucks to be you  Yep  You got the old  Rudder in the water  Yeah  You had the record  Until you got caught  In the drain  The Kenyans won't win  This one  Will they  But if  If you're  Interested in this stuff  At all  Just google it  Because it's the weirdest  Thing 
[01:58:00]  It's like these  It's pretty much  Long pants  You should have to wear  Shorts  Or little  Batting suits  Yeah  Right  Yeah absolutely  There was another  Thing about  Mark Spitz  Didn't have special  Pants  Oh  And he did the  Butterfly  Did he  Yeah  That's a tough one  That was his big  I know  You watch people  Doing that  You're just like  I don't know how  That hurt  I'm trying to learn  How to swim  Hand over hand  Like I could stay  Afloat for years  But I got goggles  And a nose pinch  So I could swim  To get rid of the belly  You know for girls  And I don't know  How to swim over  I just kick 
[01:58:30]  And I sink  It's very hard  To swim  Like real swimming  Where you do that  Arm over arm  And kick your legs  And swim like that  And breathe  Yeah  Then you gotta turn your head  And go  When do you blow it out  Because I just hold my breath  And then my head comes back out  And I still have the last breath  And I blow it out  And I have no air  To go back under with  I think it's supposed to  Blow it out  When your head's under water  Yeah  I do the  I do the  Sort of Butterfly  The breaststroke  Yeah  I call it the sort of  Doggy paddle  Oh yeah 
[01:59:00]  The breaststroke  Does your head stay above the water  Yeah  That's why I call it the sort of  Yeah  I never  Alright listen  And then to finish up  Our sports break  I didn't even know  We really were  But something weird  Happened in baseball  The Dodgers beat the Angels  Over the weekend  Without getting a hit  Is that the first time  In history  No that's happened  A couple times  Happened a couple times  Happened a couple times  It was 1-0 right  Yeah the guy got to  First base on an error  Took second  And then I think  They went to pick him off  And the ball went in the outfield  So the runner went to third  And he scored on a sack fly 
[01:59:30]  So  Ah  Who was pitching  Did they get a loss  And a no hitter  At the same time  They got the loss  But you don't get credit  For the no hitter  Unless you have  27 outs  And they  Since it was the home team  They didn't have to go to bat  So there were only 24 outs  I like this stunt brain  Because you know what  I did not know that  Until right now  I didn't know it either  So he had 24 outs  Stunt brain  So he doesn't get the  Freaking no hitter  Because you have to have  27 outs  Right  And there were two pitchers  Involved  There are several  Two pitcher no hitters  In history  But this didn't count anyway 
[02:00:00]  Wow  I did not know that  So a home pitcher  Wait  In order for it to be  A legitimate no hitter  You have to record  27 outs  Okay  And he didn't record  27 outs  Because they didn't have to  Pitch the ninth inning  Because the home team  Was up  1-0  Right  Was he a visiting pitcher  Yep  Well I guess so  Wait  I'm confused  I'm confused too  You don't have to play  That last half of the ninth  If you're losing you do 
[02:00:30]  Wait  Now I'm really confused  You're right  The Dodgers beat the Angels  Without getting a hit  So  Oh I see  Okay  They never  Alright I got you  Wait a minute  They didn't have to bat  In the bottom of the ninth  Because they won the game  Right  But each pitcher  The Dodgers Jimmy  Had last upsies  Right  So he didn't get  But they didn't need  Their last upsies  Because he was winning  Yeah  And they  I heard the story say  Because they didn't get  27 outs  They don't get the no hitter  I'm so confused right now  I got it  I'm so bad 
[02:01:00]  I know you might be right  I'm just not grasping it  Because I'm bad with math  Did you get it?  No  I just made like I did  To try to move  Alright  Okay  I'm just not  Ah Travis is here  I'm sure this will clear  Everything up  So the Angels  So the Gay Parade  Where were you?  No I was  Actually seeing another  Kind of gay thing  I went ahead of Yuzard  Last night  So  Oh  How was it?  Great  I heard it was terrific  Amazing yeah  Two hours  Yeah I heard it was great  He's sold out Radio City  How many nights? 
[02:01:30]  Three nights  Jesus  Yeah  So the Angels  Pitchers were the ones  Getting the no hitter  But the Dodgers were leading  One to nothing  They're playing in LA  So the Dodgers bat  In the bottom of the ninth  But they don't need to bat  In the bottom of the ninth  Because they won  One to nothing  Even though they didn't get a hit  Even though they didn't get a hit  So the Angels pitchers  Would have pitched in the bottom of the ninth  But they didn't have to  Who was home?  The Dodgers  So the Angels  But who's on first?  So wait 
[02:02:00]  Oh I see I see  Because a no  The Angels pitchers only pitched  Eight innings  Normally to get a no hitter  If you're on the road  You'd be winning  So the team would take their last ups  Right  Yeah  No matter what  Oh I see  Because you'd normally be winning  In a no hitter  But this is rare  Okay I got it  Thank you  Here's a quickie  A tractor trailer  Transporting Black and Gus  There's Black or Gus  Was stopped on the side of the beltway  While the driver changed the flat tire  I wonder if those cows  Named Black and Gus 
[02:02:30]  Were actually Black Angus cows  Way to get it  Way to get it  Wow  I'm a reporter  My name is Ass and Hat  I wonder if anyone notices  That I'm an asshat  Jesus you dummy  Perhaps more than that  Black and Gus  I wonder if they're Black Angus  Black Angus  Way to explain it  It's investigative reporting  At it's best  Wow  That guy  Was stupid  Sorry  No 
[02:03:00]  Don't worry about that  We got  I was just saying  He was stupid  We got a yearbook prank  These things pop up  Every year  Right  This sounds  The old yearbook  Well thought out  Sure  A racial prank  At a local high school  Is making a lot of people angry today  Someone replaced the names  Of Black Student Union members  In the yearbook  With what students call  Ghetto names  And the appearance  Of students  Made this discovery  Right before graduation  School administrators tell us  The misprint  Should have never happened  It's not only embarrassing 
[02:03:30]  But inappropriate  The Black Student Union  Was the target  Of the joke  The name of each student  Featured in the club picture  Was replaced  With fake names  Such as  Tay-Tay  Shaniqua  And Crispy Nanos  That's pretty funny  I love how they have to say  Crispy Nanos  Those names  With a very serious  Tay-Tay  Tay-Tay  Yes  Like Shaniqua  Is a name though  It would be really weird  If they replaced them  With names like  Jane and Robert  Ted  And Ethel  Who knew that those 
[02:04:00]  Were mistakes  Except for the people  Whose names they actually were  Agnes  Agnes  Greta  Who's brave enough  To take this chance  In this day and age  Not brave  It's stupidity  At this point  You think it's just  Completely good  Oh yeah  You start thinking  About doing things like this  2000 yearbooks were passed out  School officials  Have apologized  And are currently  Trying to do  Everything they can  To fix the problem  In the meantime  For some students  The painful memory  Of the prank  Will be hard to forget  No offense  But it's not that painful 
[02:04:30]  In the end  It really isn't  It just isn't  How about this  Get  Well  They're never going to look  At your yearbook again  After the first year  So who gives a crap  Go ahead Jeremy  No I was only going to say  Just get your new yearbook  Because they're going to  Issue you a new one  Yeah  With your regular name  No one can get over  Crap anymore  It's like you can't even  Who wasn't the  Victim of either  Some kind of practical  Joke  Or a gag  Or thrown a beating  Or whatever the hell  It was  When you're going 
[02:05:00]  Through school  From first grade  Or kindergarten  Up until  You know  College  You were never  The victim of  Some kind of prank  Or  You move on  You go  Oh  That sucked  I was really  Gotten on that one  And then you just  Move on  They were hurt  Beyond repair  Now  The lawyer steps in  And he'll take care of it  Yeah  The prank  Will be hard to forget  Assistant principal  Joe Mitchell  Is deeply troubled

I'd love you to have half of this when it doesn't work out  My sister told me I should have done it that way  Because you know  Empty condo  Keys for the first time  The ring should have been on the windowsill  I did it a different way  What?  How'd you do it?  I don't remember  Come on  You have to remember that  Last summer on vacation  Down there in the Outer Banks  On the beach 
[02:18:30]  Oh right  Yeah  But that's a great way to do it is what I'm saying  Oh definitely  Put the ring in a little book that was meaningful to us  And we did the whole thing  Look at the book  I gotta be honest  The hackiest way to do it  And I know a lot of people do it this way  And I apologize ahead of time  But at a sporting event  Don't like that one  Don't like that one  Definitely not  In between like you know  A stoppage of play at an Islander game  I cringe every time  I go  Well John do you have something to say? 
[02:19:00]  Like to ask  And then everyone's like  Oh waiting for  I say yes  I know a lot of people do it that way  So I apologize  But I  Apologize?  Fuck them  Did you see the video  Where the woman walked off the basketball court?  Yeah it was great  Was it real?  What she  She was mad that he asked her that way?  We played the audio  I think it  I think it had come out  That it was  It was a gag  It wasn't  It was set up for Valentine's Day  Oh  Oh 
[02:19:30]  God you can work for Steve  You think everything's real on the internet  It's real  I already know how I'm going to do it  Um  I'm going to swallow the ring  And then make her rifle through every load of my shit to get it  There's a prize in there  That's right  Somewhere  That's right  Fucking let me make her strain  Every fucking Metamucil bowel movement I have  Oh yeah  Until she finds it  And then she'll put it dirty on her finger  I go  So what do you say bitch?  Just hand her a strainer 
[02:20:00]  How long that would stink for  Fucking too bad  Be symbolic of what I'm about to do  I'm thinking Sunday morning  After you take care of your business  You hand over the strainer  And go  Hey there's a  There's a nice suit for you  Waiting in the bathroom  Remember that thing we talked about?

Right  Fucking knock a bunch of moose out  You guys didn't have to  You didn't really have to fight anyone  Matter of fact we even  1867 something about that  No see you don't even know  Like the best you got  We as a  The United States gave you Montreal back  I don't recall it that way 
[02:23:30]  Little known fact  Montreal was part of the United States  For a very small time  And we didn't want it  Because it was a little too cold  So we're like here have this  And the engines there were really nasty  They talk two languages  Give it back  That's right  How long did we have Montreal for?  Oh god  Could be maybe a week  Maybe a year or two  I'm serious  We had it  It was part of America  For a very short period of time  You know I still don't get  What this fucking Canadian holiday is about  I don't either 
[02:24:00]  It's not celebrated  See the firecrackers  Are supposed to be  A simulation of the  You know the war that went on  That freed this country  From the tyranny of England  Right  So what did you  What do you guys set them off for?  For fun  For fun  Because it's  Frequently referred to as  Canada's birthday  Particularly in the popular press  The occasion marks the joining of the British colonies  Of Nova Scotia

[02:25:30]  Why do they want to do that  Language  I'm talking with the French  The French wanted their own citizenship  Or some bullshit up there  I don't know  That's not why  It's because the rest of Canada  Was shipping all of their shit  On garbage scouts  And dumping it in Montreal  And they had enough  That might be a  Canada had a no toilets movement  And it would all shit  In bags  And fucking send it to Montreal  And drop it by plane  Yeah  And they were tired of it  Our churches and streets  Are littered with your duty  And we want to succeed 
[02:26:00]  Succeed  Whatever we want to do  Succeed  They said succeed  Alright guys punch it out  We're learning more about this  1867 thing  That you guys celebrate  Mikey again  From Centum Riches  He writes  They drink beer  Hump a mousse  And light Celine Dion on fire  That's funny  That's what they do every year  They parade her  On the 1st of July  They parade her  Pussy flaps down Main Street  Everybody just looks at them  I'm surprised your husband  Didn't gamble those away  Yeah let's go to Jesse  In New Hampshire  Oof  How we doing?

Now you get he's not talking about baseball  Oh  Thank you Sam  Yeah  I was going to say  Because it doesn't feel good  Because your knees  You know  You're hunched over like that  Behind the plate the whole time  Yeah I mean  That was the day of the Subway Series game  But we were not at a baseball stadium  Wow  Why are you using baseball terminology? 
[02:34:30]  It's kind of like a metaphor  Yeah  Which I don't really understand  But maybe Cream Pie could clear up for everyone  Cream Pie comment?  Pitching infers who's going to be on top  And catching is who receives that  Uh huh  That goodness  Yeah  That nice fat one  You have arguably  And I like you a lot

Cream Pie  Hangout Sam was a lot of fun  His eyes were wandering  Cream Pies  Really?  He had never seen anything like that in the big city  You've never seen stuff like that?  I've been down to the village a couple times  Yeah you have  What was the craziest thing you saw down there? 
[02:37:00]  Or the most flamboyant or  The most over the top thing?  There was um  Like they did this like superhero thing  And there was like all these superheroes dressed up like Batman and Robin and all that stuff  And then there was this  Altered like comic thing  And there was this  Green guy with a giant cock  He was just walking around  Surprised everyone else wasn't green with envy  Go ahead Green Pie  Sorry  You're talking to him 
[02:37:30]  It's fine  This is a cock  So he had a giant green cock?  Yes  How giant?  I'd say it's about six feet  Wow  A six foot green cock  He's not even ripe yet  And?  Um  And he was just walking around with this  Displaying it  Yeah  He was dancing  He was part of a parade float  And then there was these uh  Two gay superheroes  Like we uh  We met 
[02:38:00]  Sam  I forgot what they were about  Because Sam interviewed them  No I didn't  Go ahead  Oh  Okay  Because I didn't  No I didn't interview them  Um  What else was there?  There was this whole renaissance thing  Bunch of guys dressed like queens  Yeah  What else did we see  At day?  I'm trying to remember  Alright we'll go back to your audio  Have you ever done this before?  Once or twice last summer  I'm talking to him  Alright more from uh  Cream Pie Jones 
[02:38:30]  And this uh  Christian guy  Yeah I think this is a clip where  Uh Cream Pie  Completely loses his bearings  And uh  Has no idea what his question is  But luckily recovers  Did he get flustered by the  The man meat?  I just  I don't know  I just  Kind of just  Alright let's listen  Um  You're a professional  Oh what  Yeah  Wait  He's just  I  I just  I just completely lost  What the hell? 
[02:39:00]  He's just standing there with the mic  My train of thought  Keeping this guy  The guy's like almost about to leave  Sure  Because he stood there for ten seconds  Just going  Um  And waving the mic around  Like he was thinking of something  I don't know  I just  I you know  Went blank  For ten seconds  Yeah  And so  But luckily  He came back  Because you could tell  That he had to think that long  Because his question is super original  And creative  Alright let's go with it  Um  Um  You're a professional 
[02:39:30]  Oh what  Yeah okay  Uh  Are you a pitcher or a catcher?  Oh I'd be more of a catcher  I would say  Where are the pitchers?  Like who's fucking these fags?  I know  They're all in the bullpen  He's blowing up  The same question you asked before  Yeah  One question you ask  And you throw it out there  Like aggressively  You're a pitcher or a catcher?  Yeah but  Cream pie continues with his baseball metaphor 
[02:40:00]  So he's good with innuendo  Yeah  Why do you like to catch?  Well because you know like  When there's a ball coming at you  It's really exciting  Do you like bats or balls?  Do I like bats or balls?  Oh I would say bats are a lot better  But balls are good too  Oh I see  See because the bat is the  The cock  That's the cock  And the balls are the balls 
[02:40:30]  And he likes the cock better  Apparently  In his ass because he's a catcher  A back to back  And a belly to back  All right  And we got one more  Knit as high  Knit as long  Knit as full of shit  And then yeah  The next clip  He decides to  Forgo  I believe  He forgoes  The baseball innuendo  And also  All tact  And just goes ahead  Oh okay 
[02:41:00]  He's not subtle  Is what you're saying  Yeah  Okay  Would you say you're a size queen?  Huh?  Would you say you're a size queen?  Oh yes  Approximately how big  Was the biggest cock  You've ever had?  Well about the size  Of the Empire State Building  That's impossible  That's not for real  Okay  I'll talk to you guys later  Bye  Bye  See you had to like  Point out that it was impossible  To have a cock  The size of the Empire State Building 
[02:41:30]  Because you wouldn't even get  The like the transmitter  On the  The roof of it  You wouldn't even get  That up your ass  Right  Like never mind  The entire Empire State Building  Yeah  Well imagine how big  The person would have to be  Because even somebody  As big as King Kong  Was able to climb  The Empire State Building  Right  You'd have a 900 foot cock  Yes  And the diameter  By five inches  900 feet by five inches around

[02:50:00]  and and and yeah from from like uh presence with uh yeah pot usa dave deterer yes hot usa  yeah that's that's what some of the people call us i never yeah thinking that we  smoke the weed well i think you did that on purpose dude you pick up totally from pot usa  what's up duff how are you good morning safe to say a huge fan of pretty much everything you've done 
[02:50:30]  everything pretty much i mean i i gotta start with velvet revolver i was a huge fan sweet huge what  happened what well there's no was we're going to know i understand that yeah which is cool how well  how are you going to get a new uh lead singer um carefully i guess do you have anybody in mind  we we actually yeah we've worked with a couple guys over the last month uh anyone we know  are you yeah probably but you don't want to say uh not yet not until we're we're sure who it is but 
[02:51:00]  uh yeah it's it's pretty positive i mean the thing with uh slash and and matt and i and dave at the  end uh especially in europe our last month out it was it was kind of uh it was messy but i think it  drew us closer musically it was an odd sort of you know sort of like uh under the common oppressor  you you become tighter you know type of thing and uh it was just you know we were in a situation that 
[02:51:30]  was really difficult and and uh we came together and started writing amazing music are you saying  that he just turned into an a-hole or was he always an a-hole or uh i you know i don't really  go there because it's it's it's pretty unnecessary it was just a situation that  couldn't be helped how's that right and um we we couldn't go on and we had decided back in january  to to move on without scott what was it as drugs uh it was a combination of a lot of things that 
[02:52:00]  just made it really hard to do business and go out and tour no i i asked you know i gotta say i i i  love scott he and i have a lot of things in common and uh he's a hell of a front man  um however i think the way i foresee going about music and and moving forward in a positive  direction and his vision of that are are started to separate right you have to be messing up though  because you dealt with axel for a long time and then for you to go to a guy look you're a little 
[02:52:30]  too dysfunctional yeah i mean he really had to be screwing up was he isolating himself from the rest  of the band very much so yeah because uh there's a reason i started with this because i was fortunate  to see a pretty crazy incident i was sent the link of that that is as true as it went down we're at the  pnc art center what about a month ago uh for the stp thing i'm a huge stone temple pilots fan as well  as guns and roses as well as vel revolver that's why i thought this whole thing that's amazing was  great and uh it was a it was a k-rock show and uh filter got off stage and anthony and i went on just 
[02:53:00]  to say hey you know and stone temple pilots will be you know in five minutes and then i i took a seat  and i'm not joking well over an hour well we push an hour and a half at that point yeah close to an  hour and a half that well at this point an hour no band so i go to kenny one of our guys i go kenny  something's going on so i run back stage and i got to see one of the leo brothers yelling and screaming  at scott wyland's uh bus he was in there by himself and and uh this daleo brother was losing 
[02:53:30]  his fucking mind because jersey is his hometown and he's like you know you're not gonna do this to  me in my fucking hometown and then he just starts screaming come on out axel come on out just  screaming and then uh this is i i've told this story a million times and i apologize to the faithful  listeners but i'm telling duff he probably could you know he'll find some humor in this i guess  then the uh there was a bodyguard that wouldn't let uh you know this particular daleo brother on 
[02:54:00]  the bus he was just guarding which i thought was weird because you're all in the same band you'd  think that you guys hang out and stuff and then finally the the uh oh uh a bodyguard a bodyguard  in front of the bus yeah you know it's bleak when you're yelling at a big steel bus right  and he wanted to get on the bus to to confront scott and the bodyguard was having none of it and  then some woman appeared that scott wyland was with i don't know wife ex-wife girl i don't know  and and this daleo brother was calling her a cunt and said get off my fucking door it was so ugly 
[02:54:30]  and then the bus opens up and then uh scott just comes out like uh weekend at bernie's like like he  was a war walking corpse and then daleo was in his face going can you even do the fucking show  and next thing you know they went their separate ways one went stage right the other goes stage left  and literally two minutes later they're playing their first sdp song how was the show huh how was  the show yeah well let's just put it this way then we went to boston for the exact same show the next 
[02:55:00]  day the boston show was way better so something was going on yeah in jersey it's hot you know it's hard  to find a front man who's not what i call lv positive lead vocalist positive he's got it's you know  yeah a little bit of the prima donna thing yeah so it it seemed to me that whatever problems he was  having with you guys seems to be continuing that's all i'm gonna say and yeah it it wasn't us you know  it wasn't um it's just a unfortunate uh place he's in and in his life i think and and i hope i hope he 
[02:55:30]  pulls it together right really for the sake of himself and and uh you know his fans and and before all of  that you know his family yeah so um yeah that's that so we're we're moving on and it's uh it's a  really positive thing slash and i especially we've been playing together slash has done our show a  million times the guy is amazing his book was amazing yeah it's great and and uh you know we've 
[02:56:00]  been playing together now for 23 years wow and we've persevered through some pretty uh tumultuous times  and right and uh we will persevere through this again and that's what we do you know i guess that's  what we do are you excited about the possibilities for the new lead singer i am yeah we worked with a  guy and uh you know i wish i could say to who it is um someone we know obviously pretty well he  actually lives in this town in new york yeah how's that okay it's a hint boy that's not many music 
[02:56:30]  people live here um but he's great he's great he's great lou reed yeah well that would be bad  that would be badass wouldn't it that would be seriously you know yeah or iggy i was just gonna  say that the two of them trading off you know yeah be good yeah so i mean the possibilities that  kind of stuff is is really fun right wow yeah lou reed that'd be killer yeah um um but you know music  is is a thing that i'm i i suppose i was put here to do and and i will go on right on i'm not gonna 
[02:57:00]  let a situation where a guy um was having a tough time with life in in my career or put a dent in my  right right cool um and then we'll move on but it has to be asked uh guns and roses ever getting the  original i have that question and the last time i asked slash is like oh enough about axel but i mean  people want to know out there yeah um you know there's there's nothing in the cards i think a 
[02:57:30]  lot's been said and i don't know where it it amazes me that i see things like you know oh yeah they  were in talks to do a nothing even close to that yeah with the internet uh rumors get they run rampant  you know and and and it's funny you know where these topics will come from you know i i was when  velvet revolver started we had this fan site and i'd read all the i got caught up in it reading the 
[02:58:00]  form and oh no well i didn't you know it's kind of my first time like wow it's kind of cool they're  all talking about this and and and and uh somebody posted a topic and and they were asking the ages  of the people and they were 14 13 and these these are things people are taking seriously that's just some  kid going yeah wouldn't that be cool and then it you know it's reported on the news it is yeah and  it's it's you know some kid in his bedroom and uh which is great sure it's a it's a hobby for them 
[02:58:30]  but uh you know his blogs get printed or whatever right so then it becomes sort of almost a common  topic becomes truth too it's like it's so easy for just rumor and speculation to become true because  somebody will read it on a blog and then tell people hey here's what i read and no one assumes  or or wants to think of the source it's just hey i read this yeah yeah oh so it must be true it must 
[02:59:00]  be true yeah so um uh guns and roses you know perhaps one day uh we're all alive which is something  you know kind of amazing right uh that's the first hurdle right that's a weren't you the closest axel  he and i also have a lot in common and and you got to look at it look at this we went through  this amazing uh period in our lives together and and it was a it was a really unique view of the world 
[02:59:30]  from the particular particular floor we were on and the ride that we were on and nobody else i i can't  even relate what we went through to even somebody like dave who who went through it too because we  were in this really unique band and and uh it got people around the world believed in what we were  uh portraying usually and that around the world not just in los angeles or new york 
[03:00:00]  and you know i'm talking every place and and it was pretty stellar time in my life um and so we  have this thing in common uh and do you feel like it ended too soon because you guys really had it  seemed like you had more really good music in you did you guys feel like guns and roses kind of  could have kept going a little bit longer put out a couple more albums and it was frustrating  at the time no it had ran its course uh there was there was things that we couldn't foresee 
[03:00:30]  and the band got huge and there was there was people there were particular people driving wedges  between us and uh you know there was no how-to video at the time like this can happen to you and  this can happen to you uh and all of the things happened to us all of the uh pitfalls i suppose  you told me a great story duff once we were talking duff was telling me about this time when  i can't remember what's the song what that implies some homophobia and you guys were just getting 
[03:01:00]  ripped in the press in new york um there was some sort of anti-semitic or homophobic it's one in a  million yeah that song and we were talking a few years ago and you guys were in new york at the time i  think you were playing the garden and there were people picketing and going crazy and obviously you  guys are all open-minded you know crazy artist motherfuckers right you're not that's not who you were  and and i was like why didn't you guys why didn't you and slash go talk to the press and you guys  were just like that wasn't our thing so you guys were just in this completely different mindset where 
[03:01:30]  it's like don't explain don't complain that's just do our thing i think that's a good place to be  though yeah absolutely i mean that's the place where you can make uh some real art just unfettered yeah  yeah i remember i was on a plane i was i was flying back home to seattle and uh this flight attendant  she was african-american lady and she she said hey are you guns and roses like 1990  you know yeah yeah are you really a racist oh and i and i i all of a sudden became like two inches tall 
[03:02:00]  and i looked at her i said no i you know what am i supposed to say i said of course i'm not a racist  you know because oh you know you guys have a reputation and that that was there for about a year  wow yeah it's kind of tough but um uh all in all it was an amazing and positive experience and  and like i said it was a very unique uh view of the uh of life that we had together and and 
[03:02:30]  nobody can ever take that away and and perhaps one day we'll do something together and um  what happened what happened with axel like what happened  uh not not much is known about him since uh i think you guys broke up in what 98 somewhere around  there 97 yeah in the last 10 years you really don't know much about the guy except for the chinese  democracy thing but i don't know about the last 10 years i mean i think certain things happened to all 
[03:03:00]  of us not just axel and and uh and it's nobody's fault it's just it just happened the the wedges  were were put in there different people had different motives outside of the band uh the band  you know uh got huge beyond control and um maybe perhaps if we we could have seen had a crystal ball  and seen what was going to happen we could have maybe done some things differently like pulled it 
[03:03:30]  back and went and played theaters you know uh or whatever you know there's a million different  options you insert your own did you know did you know you guys had something that was  really original and special especially at the time because it's pretty much just you know uh generic  hair bands out at that time and for you guys to come out and just bring you know rock back again  uh you must have known like hey this is kind of uh taken off and very original and we were in our 
[03:04:00]  bubble yeah uh we had our own beliefs uh we weren't really looking around and going oh there's  hair bands and there's this there's that we were just doing our thing and we didn't give a shit  about anything else at all and we were we were a gang we really were and uh we had written this music  that was our own and uh you know we had our all had our different influences and it was that it was  that moment in time when all of your influences uh came together and you created this this thing 
[03:04:30]  that sounded exactly like what you had in your head and uh and you went out every night and you  played it and it you played it like it sounded you know that the appetite record was just us playing  i mean that's what we sounded like and it came out it got really relayed onto a two-inch tape  and they made records of this and it was what we sounded like you know and it was that sort of  simple thing one of the greatest albums ever absolutely ever i mean still to this day you 
[03:05:00]  could throw that on and you just wow you guys somebody asked somebody asked is the music still  there and i gotta say as a fan oh yeah yeah timeless i mean and the music's still there you  listen to velvet revolver first record especially but then duff has uh it's kind of side side band  loaded hard rock thing that i played on the last record that you guys made but they're just making  a new record right now and i was listening to the rough mixes on the plane out here last night  it is fucking killer it is yeah guns appetite level just i'm having a great time hold it to 
[03:05:30]  that dave it's you gotta hear it yeah um yeah i'm having a fun really fun time right now uh playing  music it's it's it's uh i i some for somebody i got really re-inspired last december january and  started taking bass lessons and really learning my my craft and i'm gonna start you know i've been  playing guitar a ton and started even playing drums again and right uh yeah and i have my my friends in 
[03:06:00]  in seattle and we have this band loaded and uh we just made another record and it's really killer  it's really i'm really excited about that too you know and yeah it looks like you're having fun i mean  i saw velvet revolver a couple times and the thing that's very obvious you slash and the rest of you  guys were just just having fun playing slash when i have this this this thing and it's unspoken it's  almost like you don't care if you if you sell records you're just out there having a good time  and you believe in the music you guys uh created it's about that moment you know uh when you're playing 
[03:06:30]  in front of people and and feeding off that energy and feeding off of of each other on stage and  yeah record sales and all that you know that that that's a whole nother subject you know record  sales where where are they at now um so you can't really be bothered with all of that stuff if you're  really creating music for the right reason which is to uh portray what for some reason you feel 
[03:07:00]  something and you write a song and or write a riff and and then somebody else slash will write a part of  another riff and matt will come up with something and it's this thing you created and and you're not  thinking at the time will this be a hit single right it's just something you believe in and uh  um i don't know that's what we do very cool i got i have a question i want to ask you two before i  forget i just want to reach out we're talking to duff mckagan obviously uh on the op and after  show again what is the longest another band member made you wait to go on stage while an audience was in 
[03:07:30]  like oh you got to go back there don't you no no it doesn't be anybody in particular i'm talking  about art and music but but yeah but it ties in in a way because bands have always interested me  because i perform alone and when i have bands it's like you're relying on other people i perform alone  too sometimes oh yeah like that of course i'll just do i'll just do bipar whatever whatever happens  on the stage i know i'm having a good show i can't imagine having to wait for somebody else like 
[03:08:00]  the frustration that must build up like what's the longs you ever had to wait for anybody you  don't have to name who it is yeah yeah um hours for these guys uh was it four hours four or five  hours and four so could you imagine you paid a ticket the band before guns and roses goes off stage  four hours later i waited two and a half hours at the kingdome to see the to see the guns and roses  band yeah two and a half hours after the opener was gone after well after the second opener after  motorhead and then i waited for an hour to see metallica and then uh two and a half hours after 
[03:08:30]  metallica yeah and i gotta say it was worth it it was yeah it was awesome i mean they hear you know  when the crowd starts chanting you know bullshit bullshit that's really tough you're sitting  underneath the the bleachers or whatever wherever you're at you know and you're ready to go  yeah and it really uh i've had that was there were some pretty dark times in there for me  uh i i drank a lot and i and i i drank more and more as a result of of uh you know i was already 
[03:09:00]  predestined to be an alcoholic so i'm not blaming that but uh yeah yeah that sucks because then you  lose your buzz while you're waiting for you know are you just completely completely hammered  one or the other i mean you just see watching your integrity slip away you guys don't know duff but i've  known him for a long time and his thing is like if he says he's gonna do something he does it and  we've had little bands and gigs we played for 20 people you know where we missed a flight and had to 
[03:09:30]  buy two first class tickets and get there in two hours yeah he does it period you know i'm gonna be  there i'm gonna do it so i can imagine it was excruciating to sit back there while somebody else  hey going back to the drinking one of the most amazing things ever in in rock and roll history it  happened to duff mckagan your your uh pancreas exploded from too much drinking yeah you should  not be here i'm thinking yeah the pancreas is one of those organs that that very delicate what does  it do first of all you get the cancer and you're dead within months i'm i can't imagine it's a good 
[03:10:00]  thing for this thing to explode well what what happens when what happens when that when that  particular thing happens to a human is uh it it secretes the the acid that digests your food  right etc uh onto the outside of your your organs your intestines and everything and it burns third  degree burns great so the pain is is i wanted them to to kill me yeah wait a minute you did it just  did it just like because like it just kind of opens up and then one minute you're okay and then 
[03:10:30]  one minute you're in agony it expands uh you know i think a pancreas is well yeah tv cameras here uh  it's a you know it's not a big plum maybe yeah and it expanded to the size of like a half of a  football and it then it burnt mine burst so yeah that's not good so what do they do sew it back  together well they would usually they i signed something from them to cut half of it out and it  would be at best a diabetic um but miraculously mine they kept doing ultrasounds and mine came 
[03:11:00]  back down and that was a a large reason uh uh of me getting sober not staying sober i suppose right  was that miraculously i survived really uh kind of unscathed wow yeah what year was that that was 94  so ever since yeah that's great and you weren't i mean how old were you in 90 you weren't that old 
[03:11:30]  no 30 30 years old 30 yeah and that's the reason why you don't drink anymore i mean you got that  they basically said if you start drinking again there's no way you'd make it right yeah you're  done oh my god yeah so you know i was in the hospital for i think 10 or 11 days and and they  said okay we have a we have a rehab place for you to go to and i saw some things in the hospital not  to sound corny at all but you know really i i saw myself from above the bed and uh i saw some pretty  uh heavy things in there and by the time the 11 days was over i was done you know they had weaned me 
[03:12:00]  off of uh they had librium in one arm which is for the dts and they had morphine in the other arm so  it was kind of a gentle come down through the dts and everything and so by the time uh the 11 days  was up i was good and i said i'm done they said well if you have a drink today you know and you  could die in an hour you know or today or this week or you know but you you know you'll be dead 
[03:12:30]  and i said okay point well taken some incentive yeah so cool um but hey i'm here  we'll get the plugs i mean we're going to talk about nutsy.com in a second uh but i just what  else you want to ask come on one more and then we'll try to lighten it up a little bit but uh i'm  a huge kirk hobain fan and weren't you uh with him pretty much right near the end there i was on a

[03:13:30]  in the same boat you know a couple uh kindred you know uh dudes and um i i think i even lost a shoe  on that flight somehow i came on with one shoe but i don't mean to laugh yeah sorry but it's funny  it is i guess right and i think the shoe actually even it was converse made us these shoes and had  our names on it like on the back somewhere someone has someone has a cool shoe right now  yeah and i mean i just got home and i you know i had one shoe that said duff on the back of it 
[03:14:00]  you lose your shoe but i did not realize until you get home where did it go but but um yeah we got  we got to seattle and he was just going to go to home by himself my a friend of mine uh good buddy  mine was picking me up at the airport and uh we were all down at baggage claim uh kurt myself and  my friend eddie and uh kurt was going to go out and have a smoke and i i said eddie why don't you

[03:15:00]  lot of guys that were in our boat then there was a lot of uh drug use and a lot of us did not  survive we just did this tour with alice and chains back in september and uh fall or uh summer and  fall sorry and uh it was amazing playing those are my brothers you know and and jerry and i used to  you know go pretty hard together and slash and i and sean and we had we were the survivors and we we 
[03:15:30]  had a meetings at at these gigs it was four of us and we're looking at each other like wow we're the  we're the guys who are still alive wow yeah lean steely had an amazing voice oh my god i never got  to see alice and chains live and he's a he was a funny fucker was he oh my god yeah yeah they were  amazing great guy i saw one of the first pearl jam gigs mookie blaylock gig it was them with alice  and chains alice had already had a major label record out alice and chains just blew i mean they just 
[03:16:00]  wiped everybody off one of my favorites alice and chains he died very alone i mean i mean he he shut out  everybody family friends i mean everyone no one no one saw him at the end of his life  lane steely's yeah and i mean i not to be morbid but he was he was dead for a while before they  you know because he shut up people that much yeah yeah that's sort of a uh sensitive subject 
[03:16:30]  yeah so yeah no worries yeah um nutsy.com what is this about what's it about and why are the two  of us here to talk about it you know uh music business who the hell knows what's going on with  the music business people don't buy records anymore i don't know if you guys saw the crew uh put out a  single like five weeks ago sold five to one better on rock band than it did on itunes they sold like  10 000 on itunes and they sold 50 000 copies the first week on rock band no kidding obviously the 
[03:17:00]  business is changing and uh i'm kind of more on the business side now than on the music side  and i'm involved in this thing that's uh nutsy.com n-u-t-s-i-e.com and it's a service that'll  get you your itunes anywhere so you upload the data from your itunes library and you get it on your  blackberry or your other smartphone and you get it on the web wherever you are and just a way to try  to you know my goal is to be part of moving the music business into a better place you know where 
[03:17:30]  it's a more transparent better situation for the artists and the users can get the music that they  want where they want it when they want it and i kind of you know duff is a super smart guy and he  went back to school seven eight years ago to get an undergraduate degree in finance after being a  high school dropout and he's interested in getting pulled in i don't know i can't speak for you what  what's uh what's the appeal for you what  you know that so so over the the the past few years i've been you should be a professor or 
[03:18:00]  something man oh fuck you i can't help it you know i can't i got an ivy league degree i can't i can't  turn it off you gotta dumb it down for us we're all staring at you like what get your itunes on your  phone you know what's great about itunes and sorry i can't help it duff's duff's ten times  smarter than i am he just knows he's just cool yeah i've just never been cool he's he was cool  the moment he dropped out of his mama's womb he was like boom he hit the floor and he was cool  you know what what uh what's what's unique about nazi and what i really liked was they actually 
[03:18:30]  um it's a free service you you you send them basically you send them your itunes library and  then you can get your you know itunes library on your blackberry or your phone or your facebook  account and you can try out my itunes library etc etc but it also monetizes you know we all have  things on our itunes that maybe you got for free or whatever you know uh and it artists will  suddenly start getting paid because it's like a digital radio station anything uh so it's uh 
[03:19:00]  registered with ascap bmi you know all of that so artists will start getting paid for very cool  things and uh again it's free and it's it's a great positive company really really good smart  people um and i'm you know i'm interested in in you know what's going to be there for me in 10 years  time and and start starting to get into the business world it's it's fascinating to me and 
[03:19:30]  um this is a great service do you see like eventually because i forget what the number of teenagers who  didn't buy a cd in like 2007 was like a large percentage all of them pretty much oh yeah it's  all downloads and which is eventually gonna i think uh end the record companies yeah all right  because they won't be needed uh you know to do anything you guys be able to finance yourselves  just looking at a cd just seems weird at this point it's a weird piece of plastic now right  it's like why rattles around your car rattles around your car there's no business model there if 
[03:20:00]  you're a velvet revolver level band you spend 500 000 million bucks making a record and you can  only sell a few hundred thousand copies of it now which is worth a couple hundred thousand  few hundred thousand dollars back to you takes you three months to make the record there's no  business there anymore it's just gone it's over so but it opens things up for artists right you can  put out a song every week you can put out a song every day you're not tied to this okay we got to put  out 75 minutes music every two and a half years and then do this product cycle you can do it's busted 
[03:20:30]  wide open that's what sucked about growing up like let's say guns and roses you get  so into this band but now you gotta wait that like you just said yeah basically the two years  before the new you know how cool would it be just to give a new song every few months when you when  you got it'll be there i mean it's it's already it's already there but it'll it'll become the the  common yeah thing soon i think also i think as soon as a band uh mixes a song it can go straight 
[03:21:00]  yeah to the consumer it's just it's you're frustrating from the artist side too because  you make a record like the first president's record well that record was sort of three years  old by the time you're out touring on it in terms of writing it and recording it and knowing it and  then you're out there for another two years touring on it going shit we got 50 new songs yeah half of  them are recorded already we've got we want to do we want to move on yeah so it's exciting time  definitely yeah record companies got to be crying because they're just they're going to lose fucking  everything because why would you give them any money you know the production costs and getting 
[03:21:30]  all the stuff out is just got to be much cheaper you have to box it up and ship it and all that  crap well but you know record companies i gotta say were the the they just buried their head in the  sand i mean they're the they're the ones who came out you know they were always looking for a new  way to uh to sell a new product and you know it was uh it was uh what remember dats were  gonna try to be the mini cds but but as soon as they came out with the you know digitized form of 
[03:22:00]  music they didn't they didn't see far enough ahead and didn't do the research well digitized music  you can you can have that you can share that on the computer back in the napster days it was  hilarious to see all these people just trying to stop that it's like you can't stop this you can't  figure out how to how it benefits everybody they were trying to stop digital music and and napster and  all that i was like no this is the future you dummies yeah i mean it sucked for you guys  especially at first but there was no stopping it but look at this way i mean napster was trying to 
[03:22:30]  say hey look we'll share in our massive revenues from from advertising right with your artists and  they had the chance let's go let's do a partnership let's go those star chamber meetings that you think  maybe would have or should have happened those meetings all happen all the majors there  oh yeah those meetings and chairman of sony from japan they were all meeting in the bay area all  the time and they just couldn't pull their heads i gotta say you know maybe duff doesn't want to  hear this but napster ruled when it first hit it was just like oh my god this could be the greatest 
[03:23:00]  thing thing ever and you know what the artists i know you just took some some food out of my child  except for metallica you know the artists i know didn't complain right artists got it right away  they're like the only way out is through you know where there's no way we're gonna win because before  that you had to dub cassettes and stuff like fuck that man you mean i could just like get you know  someone else's thousand songs it's like high speed dual deck man it was amazing large was right  he saw the fact that people eventually were going to get just so fucked and would make no money for 
[03:23:30]  music because once it got out of hand i mean uh some case shut down kazaa you know the country  because they were saying that this uh technology was being used for stolen material so they might  have lost anywhere but he was very smart to go after them everybody gave him shit but it's like  well you shouldn't work for free right you gotta get paid for your work and what a genius apple was  yeah i think i think emi just did a deal last year a couple years ago with kazaa didn't they  yeah they broke off limewire now has a sort of a legit store a limewire store and i do feel bad 
[03:24:00]  for large because i hear he's really hurting for cash it's really tough all over well that  documentary that documentary where he's selling his uh his paintings for a few million i'm like  all right i can't really feel sorry for this guy remember he went to auction oh yeah some kind of  monster did you see that yeah yeah i love that documentary that's that's a therapist how's how dumb  was that yeah that was just on something i saw that just that that portion with the therapist and 
[03:24:30]  yeah that was and remember when the therapist got all bummed out because the band basically said we  don't need you anymore and then the therapist obviously needed a therapist to get over the  fact the band was firing him it was just unbelievable you there's some unbelievable stuff that goes on in  rock bands it's you that was brave of them too i mean i love metallica uh yeah without saying we're all  huge metallica fans and that was that was awesome that they kind of showed that they're not sitting  there yeah they're not sitting there thinking well we're gonna look great they they knew that 
[03:25:00]  people would like perceive this as kind of silly and right yeah yeah yeah so in that regard it was  it was very brave of them how much do you love motorhead oh lemmy's yeah lemmy's god and i i you  heard about this documentary this lemmy documentary no yeah yeah i it's either out or coming out really  soon uh yeah i mean that guy he's he's not only you know i mean the most intense insane that guy 
[03:25:30]  lives it he breathes it he is who drinks it yeah we talked to him in vegas for an hour wasn't he  talking about like spaceships and stuff at one point oh yeah ufos and he was whatever yeah he was  amazing he was very very in that maker's mark yeah he'll charm you know i mean my wife and i were in  uh uh london for some awards show and the award shows there are way cooler not televised they're  just like a room full of wow there's jimmy page and brian may and lemmy and you know jeff beck cool 
[03:26:00]  and uh you know lemmy was there and and he was talking he some reason he really likes me you know  every time he's like ah how you doing governor you know and i'm like wow lemmy knows like my name  governor yeah governor but whatever it's fucking lemmy you know you know what i mean and uh and he  just he'll charm the pants off of your wife or girlfriend or whatever you know uh you really  think that like when someone knows your name of course they business yeah but if it's iggy or 
[03:26:30]  somebody you're like yeah i'm i'm still who gets you really nervous i know you mentioned a few guys  there but who's the one guy who walks if he walked in right now you'd be like holy shit i'm not worthy  iggy um yeah uh there's a few guys like lemmy yeah uh lou reed he'd scare me have you guys  interviewed him no no i hear he's a tough interview yeah i could only imagine yeah sitting there little 
[03:27:00]  little hip a little too hip for uh me one of the nicest guys i i've met and and he tells stories  for hours uh robert plant really and he comes his son he has two sons that both they have bands and  they've they've both opened for velvet revolver in the uk you know wait robert plant has two sons that  are in music yeah why don't we know and he's really involved with his sons he'll come to the gigs help  them set up drums and you know like wow there's robert plant up there setting up drums but and then 
[03:27:30]  he'll regal us with with these amazing stories yeah and uh can you tell one oh god he's telling us  about um oh there's so many stories he was telling us about the um what's the song where the the woman  hits the the hits the guy with the head with the shoe uh something heather mill sang yeah god i was 
[03:28:00]  there when that was all going on over the uk that was what the heather mills man over there  they're they're brutal they're just the press is brutal uh now robert plant just had a million  great stories how old are his sons early 20s early 20s i didn't even know when he's talking though  can you even concentrate or like every time his mouth moves all you think is that's robert plant  robert plant but he he he pulls you into these stories and yeah you're that's definitely in the 
[03:28:30]  back of your head the whole time but these stories are so great and amazing you know you're just kind  of caught up in what he's talking about uh really great you know um there was a night in the uk and in  in march their last tour there and uh we didn't know if we're gonna have a singer one night and robert  plant it's like you know oh let me know let's play blues for two hours get the fuck out you were  hoping that you didn't have a singer that night locked wyland's door and threw away the key yeah 
[03:29:00]  is east side dave here no not yet we got a this guy lives for guns and roses he he's like speeding  right now to try to get to the station where's he coming from say goodbye to duff i don't know oh  brooklyn right yeah how could he not get it from brooklyn i don't know idiot some ass hey you know  you know uh bill k from philly he's gonna he's setting me up to fail miserably here but uh  did you know that uh some people say that stairway to heaven the riff was ripped off from that spirit 
[03:29:30]  song i've never heard this i've never heard that either you got it let's hear the spirit song all  right well just the beginning of it now it was said back in the day before uh stairway to heaven was  written that led zeppelin was uh touring with spirit okay and spirit had a song called taurus  that none of us know from 1968 shouldn't we get in a little uh of of the zeppelin first i think you  i think you just happen to have did you you just happen to have well this is something that we've 
[03:30:00]  been having fun with like just uh okay we call it rip-offs or coincidences in uh music all right and  the and the big one was this spirit song taurus and some people think uh they stairway to heaven  you know kind of ripped off this riff everyone in spirit everyone in spirit certainly thinks that  so this is uh taurus from 1968 just a just a quick uh clip cool  it's close 
[03:30:30]  wow a little something there and they toured together uh that's what that's how the story  goes i don't know you know but in 1968 uh spirit had that song out there yeah they definitely stole 
[03:31:00]  that i mean you know that that's the accompaniment is generally not copyrightable but uh but they done  ripped that off but they ripped off i mean the the led zeppelin as was the style then all a lot of the  blues songs the first couple records yeah arranged by led zeppelin and they take all the publishing  you know that's just part of the deal right off the black man and his blues which is why we all  enjoy zeppelin but let's be honest sabbath was the band tough please don't agree we have to agree 
[03:31:30]  yeah there was two i remember uh uh in the 70s i was still you know like 12 and 13 but there  definitely was two camps there was like the zeppelin camp and the sabbath and then sabbath camp was  usually the guys the people like from out in the suburbs yeah you know and uh you know zeppelin  was a city band i don't know why that was uh people in the city like stealing riffs  maybe that's not that i like zeppelin i like zeppelin but i get you know i've been defending 
[03:32:00]  sabbath for forever years yeah i mean i love sabbath but i love zeppelin too and yeah punk rock came  around you know when i turned about 13 so that's the direction i'm that's i mean if you want to  know where pearl jam all those bands came from where you just take equal parts zeppelin sabbath  acdc pistols and like circle jerks boom you mix that all together and that's you know put a bunch 
[03:32:30]  of kids in a bunch of schmidt you guys don't have schmidt beer out here but you know cases of schmidt  beer in somebody's basement you mix that all together and it we used to have schmidt beer you get  grunge animal beer animal beer yeah all right i forgot about animal beer animal beer yeah so duff  who do you like better sebastian bach or josh todd from buck cherry who do i like better what as a  singer or like who's cuter yeah who's got a better ass which one are you talking about well those are  the you know the rumored uh oh candidates for oh no neither one of those neither no no all right we 
[03:33:00]  got something from you today especially uh josh todd has been rumored to be uh but he's not  his band's doing great yeah yeah buck cherry is all right man they're doing great uh no no josh  no or sebastian let's make a little headline today what do you say just give us the guy you're  thinking of robert plant a new york guy i just don't have it who the hell is well the guy that 
[03:33:30]  come on my lips are sealed i will i will promote nutsy.com have you ever seen dev kickbox  oh really do you like your kickbox i wouldn't i wouldn't even get close because i walked out of  here and he'd take my head off at the neck it would be over just imagine the plugs for nutsy.com  do you like the ufc um it's it's fun to watch yeah does your new lead singer like it  i'm not sure oh is that a hit now now now now now saying that the guy 
[03:34:00]  i'm it's from it lives i i didn't say he's from new york he's living here now yeah okay  uh what do you think of stephen carr possibly uh fronting stephen carr stephen carr was in a great  band uh foundry foundry they had a hit song uh pendulum hey duff okay you guys are now he's  producing our show it's not stephen carr but you're so close i'm going to tell you who it is  stephen colbert ah oh he's good he's busting out as well i don't even know who that is  exactly this is very happy can you listen to this song pendulum just the first right up to the hook 
[03:34:30]  and i want your expert opinion on this song okay here it is we won't play the whole thing don't  worry just to the hook yeah and dave i want you guys to be honest  that guy's got the job  the hook's coming 
[03:35:00]  i'm sticking with it  there you come oh here's finally the hook 
[03:35:30]  all right your honest opinion who isn't big on that you go first  is this one of your guys band no we're just curious how about this no one in studio no one in 
[03:36:00]  studio it's been submitted and the fans have given different reactions yeah so we want an honest  opinion from a guy who's obviously who knows um you're not gonna hurt anybody's feelings i mean i  just i just know what i like and and that's not really up my alley okay that's one way to put it  what's the what's the main problem with that the singer i don't know if there's any problems  come on uh aside from the fact that you're among friends here don't worry  it's no one in studio i promise uh but he's waiting outside there with a baseball bat 
[03:36:30]  no uh it's it's god awful isn't it you know uh it what what do i say you know if somebody if  that's what they're doing and that's they they believe in to do then that's cool i'm not gonna  consummate i love the guy that refuses to trash somebody well it's so obvious he won't  it's music it's not my uh not my cup of tea that's all dave i think uh you'll be a little more  honest uh i think it would be duff's cup of tea if it were it lacks uh there's kind of a thing 
[03:37:00]  when you watch someone who's a professional or listen to them whether they're a comic or whether  they're a dj or whether they're a musician or an actor they're like the people who are really  doing it and people who are trying to do it and it's it's like what what justice said that about  pornography i can't define it but i know it when i see all right so to me those guys sound like  they're pretending to do it that's all i mean it just doesn't i'm not i'm not it's not touching  me in my heart and that usually means that you know dave and i we got into town last night about  one in the morning or 1 30 or something and we and we came through the lincoln title and came right 
[03:37:30]  out down there by the by the port authority bus station there's a guy dave looks around he goes  yep we're in new york some guy was taking a shit on the street that guy was feeling it the guy taking  the shit on the street he meant it yeah yeah you know i don't know it doesn't matter how light or  heavy what you're playing is there are people who like uh you just watch me like yep that's it that's  the real thing and that wasn't you know for me a real singer who i've just got you know i'm a little 
[03:38:00]  late getting into it but uh uh cory from slipknot holy shit that guy uh i saw his band uh last year  uh amazing uh stone sour and uh right stone sour of course man and uh but but that boundary that  slipknot uh volume three record you guys ever listen to that slipknot sounds like you're up off a  sabbath volume four just saying it all comes back to sabbath for you doesn't it thank you for noticing 
[03:38:30]  that yeah um yeah what else guys that's about it you got any other questions for me no i think we  covered uh just about everything man i'm so glad i didn't mean to go down everything out of the way  you're really cool i didn't mean to go down that lane staley uh road like that you know oh you know  it it was just a real bummer as a fan when you know that all happened yeah and i'm i'm really close  friends with jerry and sean and all those guys tell jerry to do our show he hasn't done our show  in years really yeah we love the guy yeah he's hilarious very interesting yeah he is he's a great 
[03:39:00]  guy i mean that guy can write i think allison chains uh probably the best songwriting band of in rock  in the last 30 years and who's the new lead singer i don't know his name william william it's great  he's awesome just like lane when you close your eyes so it's a great front man too yeah really good  you gotta close your eyes to because he's black so you know well you know i think i think even that  i mean what is part of the genius you know uh it's just he doesn't look like lane he he's not trying 
[03:39:30]  to be lane he's william he's his own guy he's out this summer singing with mc5 in europe which is  killer and that's a great nod and william is uh is from the same school as me at punk rock school and  he and he's uh you know a guy really means it where where's his heart on the sleeve and uh he's  a true artist and perfect for that band i've heard some of their new the songs they've been writing and  uh they're gonna put out a new record and they have this one song uh called uh hollywood or los 
[03:40:00]  angeles or something uh but it's that's one of the best songs i've heard really in a long long time  cool we look forward to yeah duff this was a pleasure uh we were stalling because we're hoping  east side dave will he's he's uh just a huge fan but yeah fuck him yeah yeah i mean you guys got  things to do i'm and dave it's a pleasure meeting you as well good to meet you guys thanks for having  us on uh the big plug for nutsy.com real fast yeah nutsy.com n-u-t-s-i-e.com go there i mean
