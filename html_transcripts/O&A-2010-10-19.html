<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the New York gubernatorial race, focusing on the "Rent is Too Damn High" party candidate, Jimmy McMillan.  Opie and Anthony, along with a caller known as "Pirate Trucker,"  found McMillan's blunt, unconventional approach refreshing, contrasting it with Andrew Cuomo's campaign.  McMillan's platform, encompassing rent reduction, job creation, and even mountain-bulldozing for land development, was a source of both amusement and genuine interest.  His Vietnam veteran status and Agent Orange exposure added a layer of seriousness to the discussion. A phone interview with McMillan himself followed, during which he detailed his platform, military service, and personal struggles.  The hosts expressed support, acknowledging the absurdity of some of his proposals. Kristen Davis's candidacy was briefly mentioned, but McMillan's outlandish persona dominated the segment. The conversation frequently employed profanity and crude humor.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Jimmy McMillan's eccentric campaign, speculation about his military experiences, and a dismissal of newspaper endorsements as meaningless.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking Paul R. Nelson's sexually suggestive campaign ads. This transitioned into a discussion about the show *Hoarders*, with the hosts expressing disgust and fascination with the hoarders' behavior and suggesting darkly comedic solutions. Several celebrity voicemails were played.  The segment included discussion of a *Hoarders* participant revealed to be a convicted sex offender, and a “Jacktober” segment featuring clips from another radio show discussing breakups via text message, prompting numerous listener calls.  A potentially fake viral video of a man falling from an elevator was also discussed, before returning to “Jacktober” and a discussion about the world’s richest man.

The "Jacktober" segment continued, leading into a discussion of the Dos Equis "Most Interesting Man in the World" commercials, which segued into hyperbolic, humorous boasts about the wealth and power of the world's richest person.  This was followed by a highly vulgar and offensive discussion of radio personalities Carter and Jackie, with Opie and Anthony employing extremely offensive language to insult Jackie's appearance and character, and making crude sexual comments.  The conversation then turned to graphic descriptions of the smell of Carter's bath towels, involving various bodily fluids and feces, escalating into listener-submitted stories with sexually explicit and offensive details.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to an interview with Ian Halperin, author of a book about Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Halperin promoted his book, detailing Schwarzenegger's alleged womanizing, political views, and claims of having had gay sugar daddies.  The conversation involved highly offensive language, sexual innuendo, discussions of Schwarzenegger's family history and alleged Nazi connections, and calls from both supportive and hostile listeners.  Mike Flees, a friend of Halperin, also participated, sharing anecdotes about working with Eddie Murphy.  The interview included discussions of Halperin's planned "bed-in" and further sexual exploits, concluding with more crude jokes and banter.

The interview with Halperin continued, focusing on his book’s low Amazon ranking,  allegations of Schwarzenegger's sexual exploits (including a potential sex tape), and Halperin’s claims of infiltrating the Republican Party. The conversation frequently veered off-topic, including discussions of other celebrities, sex acts, and crude anecdotes.  Notable moments included a caller's story about a producer's encounter with Schwarzenegger at the Playboy Mansion, graphic descriptions of sexual acts and body fluids, numerous sexually charged interactions with female callers, a caller’s account of being drugged at a porn star's apartment, and a discussion about the sexual proclivities of women from different nationalities.  Several callers expressed intense dislike for Halperin. The segment ended with ongoing discussion of Halperin's book sales, interspersed with vulgar banter and calls.


The final segment with Halperin continued, delving into discussions of Long Island Islanders hockey players (Mike Bossy, Billy Smith), Halperin's claims about Schwarzenegger's alleged sexual exploits from his book, and his planned "bed-in" to promote the book and push for a constitutional amendment to allow Schwarzenegger to run for president. A female caller, Maria, expressed interest in the bed-in, leading to sexually explicit and suggestive exchanges with Halperin.  The conversation then shifted to Philadelphia sports figures (Mike Schmidt, Ron Jaworski), before Flees recounted a Craigslist encounter where he paid a woman $20 for a hug that led to him helping her resolve a banking issue. Halperin shared stories about his alleged encounters with the Swedish Princess Madeleine and further promoted his book.  The segment ended with an update on the book's significantly dropped Amazon ranking and another Craigslist story from Flees involving breast play.  Highly vulgar and sexually suggestive language was used throughout.

[00:01:00]  are  you  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm... 
[00:01:30]  I'm protecting my soul.  Was that supposed to be some kind of sick joke?  Rent.  Too.  Damn.  I got it from a Negro. 
[00:02:00]  Ain't nothing to talk about.  Ain't nothing else to talk about.  Rent.  Too.  Damn.  Ain't nothing to talk about.  Ain't nothing else to talk about.  Rent.  Too.  Damn.  No shit.  In person.  Oh, yeah.  Rent.  Oh, man.  Too.  Damn.  Ha!  Now, I am officially backing Jimmy McMillan for New York State Governor.  You've got to say his name if you're going to back him. 
[00:02:30]  Jimmy McMillan.  Okay.  Oh, I did.  I said I'm officially backing Jimmy McMillan for New York State Governor.  All right.  He could barely say his own name.  So you said it properly.  Yes.  Correctly.  I thought Palladino was your guy in New York State.  Uh, Palladino, not quite nutty enough.  This guy is so kooky.  We found our nut.  And, uh, you know, the whore thought she was going to be the big nutty.  She's kind of a friend of the show, this Kristen Davis.  I know.  I was supposed to be her lieutenant governor. 
[00:03:00]  Well, I declined.  Well, Jimmy was first.  Oh, you were supposed to be first?  Yeah, yeah.  And then...  Who would you rather have on your ticket?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Anthony, but...  No, no, Jimmy.  And then when Jimmy backed out, I was given the, uh, offer to be her lieutenant governor.  Is she in it?  I liked it.  She's actually, when I talked to her, I don't think she'll win, obviously, but she made a  lot more sense...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You don't think she'll win?  Well, of course not.  You don't think she'll win?  She won't win.  Okay.  Not a chance in hell. 
[00:03:30]  In hell.  But she's a lot smarter than I thought, like, about the, uh...  She took your dick?  No.  No, I didn't even get a vibe off her.  No.  I was so annoyed.  Nothing.  We gotta get some, uh, audio of her.  Uh, just to set it up for the people that maybe weren't checking it out, or maybe it wasn't  being broadcast in their area, or maybe you still have, uh, problems with cable vision,  and maybe you couldn't see it that way.  I don't know.  Yeah.  There was a, uh, debate on TV for the governorship of New York State, and I'm amazed that this  went down. 
[00:04:00]  Like, I didn't know goof tickets could be in with real tickets, even though I think they're  all a bunch of goofballs in the end, but...  This is a brilliant strategy on the part of, uh, Cuomo.  Yeah.  Because, uh, he only has to sit there and let the nuts duke it out next to him, and he's  fine.  Like, he's gonna win.  He's absolutely gonna win.  We will have another Cuomo in, uh, the office of governor of the state of New York, uh,  because everyone else is a coup. 
[00:04:30]  Everyone else is just insane.  Out of their minds.  And he's, he's lumping everybody in with all the nuts, even Palladino.  He's like, oh, Palladino and the rest of these candidates.  But candidate.  But do you know how this works?  Like, couldn't Cuomo say, I'm not gonna debate these, uh, nut, nut jobs?  He, he only looks brilliant.  But when there's a presidential, uh, presidential debate, you're not gonna see Obama or any  of these other candidates sit down with goofballs.  Yeah, they don't usually do that.  I, I...  They, they will barely allow, like, a third-party candidate in there. 
[00:05:00]  They gotta be very safe.  In this circumstance, though, think of it this way.  You're going into a job interview with unbelievably, profoundly retarded people.  Right.  And you're a genius.  Right.  Um, don't you want the retards around to show the boss, like, eh, look at, look at these  guys.  Sure.  Or me.  What do you want?  What do you want?  I would think that people would start thinking Cuomo's a retard now, because he was hanging  with these guys.  No, no.  He, he looked, uh...  I think it could backfire on him.  But then again, there's no one, no one that's gonna come close to winning this thing. 
[00:05:30]  He looked like a politician.  Cuomo?  Yeah, yeah.  He looked like a politician, which is what he is, and, and the rest of them looked like  a collection of kooks.  I guess Cuomo decided to give us some entertainment yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  And, uh, and, and the thing is also, here, here's another reason he did it, is Palladino  is, uh, the only real kind of competition he has, and, and he's way behind in the polls  because he trips over his own fucking tongue, and he's a nut himself. 
[00:06:00]  And you wanted Palladino.  No, you were gonna back Palladino before this, this Jimmy McMillan came along.  Oh, now I'm, uh, Jimmy McMillan's my man.  My man rents two.  Damn high.  Well, you wanna hear the, uh, introduction of all the candidates for the debate last night?  Ah.  This is just amazing TV.  Fuck the Yankees game.  Fuck.  Oh, yeah, please.  Can we do it over?  Do over, please.  Do over.  Cliff Lee.  Wow.  We all saw that coming a mile away.  Who are you kidding?  Well, Pettit did a good job, but.  You better hope that he's not ready to pitch in game five.  I hope he gets impaled with a fucking half a bat. 
[00:06:30]  If he, if he's able to pitch game five, you guys are so done.  So done.  That was really fucking.  They're being embarrassed.  8-0 last night, right?  After that first loss, the Texas should have collapsed.  The fact they've come back and kicked the shit out of them twice.  Texas is just better.  It's fucking, Cliff Lee is fucking, an amazing, amazing fucking pitcher.  It's all about Cliff Lee.  They could not fucking touch him.  Couldn't touch him.  Should have watched some hockey last night, man.  Fuck that.  There was a great hockey game on last night. 
[00:07:00]  I was just yelling at the television.  Ah, motherfuckers.  Fucking Cliff Lee.  I want to make it official.  My team is for real this year.  For real.  And by the way.  Hey, let me finish.  My Islanders beat the fucking, uh, the fucking, uh.  Well, let me finish the Yankees.  How long has hockey been happening?  Huh?  How long has hockey been happening?  We're five games in, but my team's for real.  For real.  I just wanted to say, I am not going to take any shit from people  unless they're fucking Texas fans. 
[00:07:30]  I'm not going to sit here and have Red Sox fans go,  Your guys are fucking, you guys didn't even make it.  Shut up.  You're not a true Yankee fan, then.  What?  It's, it, the whole world is against the Yankees.  You've got to accept that.  Oh, no, I understand, but I'll just.  Didn't you listen to Bill Burr's rant about the Yankees?  I'll just be like, fuck, fuck you.  Fuck these guys.  So you, you'll only take insults from, uh, Rangers fans?  Yes, that's it.  Nah, you've got to take some Red Sox abuse, too.  No, no, no, that's ridiculous.  You got it, you have to.  They fucking.  You're wearing the Yankee hat, you have to.  They've been hanging out, doing nothing for fucking months. 
[00:08:00]  Because just imagine if the Red Sox were in it and the Yankees weren't,  you would be beating up the Red Sox right now.  You would be killing them.  Yeah, but no one would have to fucking take it.  Wouldn't be legit.  No.  I've got to sit here and fucking, you know.  You've got to take on the world.  Are you prepared for this?  No.  There's a lot of people that don't like the Yankees.  Yeah, because they're stupid.  And seeing them down two games to one,  they're going to come after you.  Are you ready?  No.  You don't have enough firepower?  No.  You don't have enough firepower to take them all on?  No, I don't have the energy to take them on. 
[00:08:30]  That's why I threw out that little warning there, hoping.  Hoping they'd just leave you alone.  But I know that's just antagonizing.  Yeah.  Damn high.  The Islanders had a great win last night against Toronto.  And this team actually might be good this year.  So we're keeping our fingers crossed.  Could we please get a clip of Opie saying this team might be really good this year every year?  A montage?  A montage of Opie saying that year after year at the beginning of the season.  They're playing differently this year. 
[00:09:00]  We'll see.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Toronto's a really good team.  And we beat them 2-1 in overtime last night.  And yes, Rolison was standing on his head last night.  Standing on his head.  He absolutely was.  All right, let's get back to the debate, Anthony.  So here's the introduction of the candidates before they started debating.  Listen to this.  Great.  This seating and speaking order was determined by a lot prior to the show.  And the audience, we again ask no more applause from this point forward, please.  In seat number one, Republican, conservative, and taxpayers' party nominee, Carl Palladino. 
[00:09:30]  Rent is too damn high party candidate, Jimmy McMillan.  Rent is too damn high party.  That's the name of his party.  Rent is too damn high.  Rent is too damn high party candidate, Jimmy McMillan. 
[00:10:00]  In seat number two.  In seat number three, Democratic, Independence, and Working Families Party candidate, Andrew Cuomo.  Andrew Cuomo was sitting next to him.  Oh, so it was a shit sandwich.  Andrew Cuomo had to sit next to him.  And I think he had, I think, uh, Kristen, who was next to him?  I don't know.  Was Kristen there?  I think.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, she was there.  Yeah, she was there.  She was throwing out some good one-liners. 
[00:10:30]  Some zingers.  She's got some zingers.  She knows how to do the one-liners.  Rent too damn high.  But rent too damn high, guys, is going to be the talk of not only New York, but of the country in the next few days.  Wait till you hear some of his quotes.  You want to just get right into it?  Yes.  They're brilliant.  This guy is a man who thinks outside the box.  Now, you listen to a career politician like Andrew Cuomo.  He'll give you the same shit you've heard year after year, decod after decod. 
[00:11:00]  Well, to set it up.  This guy knows how to talk to the people.  Well, to set it up, why don't we do a nice Cuomo political, uh, blah, blah here.  Oh, you could listen to Cuomo, talk about some of his platform, and listen to a regular career politician.  A man of the people.  If you want, go ahead.  But here's Cuomo with the same old crap you hear every politician saying.  Mr. Cuomo.  Thank you.  I think the property taxes are probably one of the most oppressive taxes in the state of New York, period. 
[00:11:30]  I can't tell you how many people say that they just can't afford to pay the property taxes anymore, and we're chasing them from their home.  The only question used to be, can you afford the mortgage when you buy a house?  Now the question is, can you afford the property taxes?  Westchester County, highest property taxes in the nation.  Nassau, second highest property taxes in the nation.  Yeah, number two.  By percentage of home value, it's actually a much worse problem in upstate New York, Monroe County.  Highest property taxes by percentage of home value in the nation. 
[00:12:00]  How do we get it down?  Two ways.  Number one, the state has to reduce what they call the unfunded mandates, all the rules and regulations on what schools must do.  But second, and bluntly, we just have two...  I pretty much just heard white noise right there.  It was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Do you honestly think the taxes will go down?  God, we're only number two?  Come on, Nassau.  Raise those taxes.  I want to hit number one.  You want to at least be number one, right?  Yeah.  How can I complain when we're only number two in the nation? 
[00:12:30]  Fuck wads.  So it's a completely simplified...  That's just basic political bullshit we've heard time and time again, right?  And then Jimmy McMillan steps up to the mic.  Now here's a man who knows how to talk to the people, think out of the box.  You're not going to hear a career politician right here.  Hell no.  You're going to hear my candidate, Jimmy McMillan.  And compare it to what you just heard with Cuomo.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I represent the rent that's too damn high party.  People are working eight hours a day and 40 hours a week is some a third job. 
[00:13:00]  Women can't afford to take care of their children, feed their children breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  My main job is to provide a roof over your head, food on the table, and money in your pocket.  This is politics as usual.  Playing a silly game.  It's not going to happen.  The rent too damn high movement, the people I'm here to represent can't afford to pay their rent.  They're being laid off right now as I speak.  They can't eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Listen.  Someone's stomach, child's stomach just growled.  Did you hear it?  You've got to listen like me.  Okay.  Let's talk about the issue.  Mr. Cuomo, 30 seconds for you, sir. 
[00:13:30]  Thank you.  He's laughing.  He's too damn high.  But he's making some great points just simplifying it.  I didn't like his miming with his gloves on of hearing the child's stomach growl.  Wait, is that why he's wearing the black gloves?  Yeah.  Because everyone wants to know why the fuck is he wearing black gloves?  God damn, I'm called the Agent Orange in Vietnam.  I was doggone on Huey.  Won three bronze stars.  I got Frederick Guggler's beard.  So why the black gloves?  Agent Orange. 
[00:14:00]  So why, though?  I don't know.  Does he have it still on his hands?  My hands is orange.  He doesn't want to rub his eyes?  I don't want to touch food.  I'm giving it to the child.  He doesn't want to rent too high.  He doesn't want to get the Agent Orange in his own eyes?  Agent Orange.  I rub my eyes and turn on.  Rent too damn high.  I love the fact that he's just simplifying it.  Rent too damn.  And everyone's laughing at him.  Why are you laughing at the guy?  They were cracking up.  He's got a great catchphrase and everything.  Rent too damn.  Jimmy comments on housing in New York.  Uh-oh.  Oh, well, housing.  Rent's too damn high, I bet.  At the end of the day, our children will have nowhere to live. 
[00:14:30]  That is what I'm fighting for.  As a karate expert, I will not talk about anyone up here.  Ah, us.  What?  The rent is too damn high.  Us.  Why did he have to mention that?  Because I'm a karate man.  Karate man bleed on the inside.  I'm a karate man.  Rent too damn high.  And they're all laughing at the guy.  Why wouldn't they? 
[00:15:00]  I am so pulling the lever for this motherfucker.  I love him.  He's great.  We've got to get him on the show.  Oh, yeah.  He's making more...  It's like he's talking from the gut.  He's not giving some fucking garbage pat answer.  Good for him.  Rent too damn high.  He's talking like a human being.  Yeah.  I didn't like the miming of the hearing in the stomach.  You didn't hear that.  You were in an order to hear him.  I heard it.  Karate expert, I will not talk about anyone up here.  Because our children can't afford to live anywhere.  Nowhere.  There's nowhere to go. 
[00:15:30]  Once again, why?  You said it.  The rent is too damn high.  The rent is too damn high.  Thank you, Mr. McMillan.  The moderator is laughing at him.  Mr. Cuomo.  First time with Jimmy.  The rent is too damn high.  Wow.  You've got a hell of a personality there.  Oh, he's just a dud.  Isn't he charming?  Bore like Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, it was on Bob Grant. 
[00:16:00]  Bob Grant used to do that, yeah.  Svachim.  Svachim.  We've got to find that.  That's an oldie but goodie.  Some guy used to call in and play the ukulele and sing that.  Mario, sum, sum, sum, sum.  Oh, did Grant hate Cuomo?  Oh, he hated Dinkins more.  Yeah.  The washroom attendant.  Great.  Too damn high.  Jimmy talks about using New York's natural resources.  Natural resources for what?  I don't know.  I didn't see this one.  Let's check it out. 
[00:16:30]  All right, Mr. McMillan.  One minute for you as well, sir.  My concern is that we've looked at it as well.  But what we plan to do, we know they're going to criticize our agenda as well.  Because we plan to bulldoze some of those mountains upstate New York to make New York  state an independent state.  I want my own.  Wait, what?  See, he wants to go upstate and bulldoze the mountains.  He wants to what?  Bulldoze the mountains, Opie.  What's the matter with you?  What's that about?  Because the rent's too damn high.  You got to bulldoze the mountains.  The mountains are in the way for Jimmy McMillan? 
[00:17:00]  He's got to spread the defolion.  That's so we can land Huey's up there.  Our dog on the three-part stop.  Ain't no mountain high enough.  Ain't no valley low enough.  Just take the mountain, fill in the valley.  Right.  That's all you have to do.  Flat ground.  I want my own cable company.  I want my own telephone company.  I want my own power plant.  This is what we're going to do to create a job.  You can't please everyone, but the bottom line is that it's time New York State become an independent state and resources.  Following the attack on the World Trade Center, we've been having to depend on everyone to give us this and give us that. 
[00:17:30]  That is over.  We can fund our own industrial plant.  Everything can be done right here in the state of New York.  Of course, I can't please everyone with what I plan to do.  But for the children, someone has to start moving for the future generation.  It's not about me or you.  We're getting old.  I'm 64 years old.  I don't know how old you guys are, but for the children, we have to take a bold move and start becoming an independent state.  And let those little small criticisms, the technology has improved.  It is great.  You're going to have a little small minor problems that happen every now and then, but it must be done. 
[00:18:00]  It must be done.  All right.  He wants to, see, look, he wants to bulldoze them mountains upstate because they're useless.  Yeah.  Fucking mountains.  They just make driving a pain in the ass.  Does he actually want to bulldoze them?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So bulldoze them down because you ever drive upstate?  You're driving around mountains.  It's like, I could have been there an hour ago if these mountains were bulldozed and they just put a straight road.  So people are wasting their time driving.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, you do that.  You save some money.  Then you build your own power plants, your own cable company. 
[00:18:30]  What else do you want?  Waterworks and the railroads and a free parking.  Yeah.  And I want Baltic and Mediterranean.  Red too damn high.  Red too damn high on boardwalk and park place.  I don't like that.  I like Baltic Mediterranean.  I don't like going past St. James Place because then red's too high.  Red get too high up there.  Marvin Gardens red too high.  He looks really scary on YouTube.  I land on free parking.  Give it to the children.  Uh-oh.  Look where I am.  I hope I get a double. 
[00:19:00]  Red too damn high.  I guess this is, uh, oh, he makes a comment on gay marriage.  Oh, does he?  It's one of those hot topics.  Let's see what he has to say about that.  Rent too damn high party for you.  If you want to marry a shoe, I'll marry you.  All right.  Time now for closing statement.  Do I marry a shoe?  I'm for you.  I guess he's okay with the gay marriage thing.  Yeah, you want to marry a shoe.  Doesn't think much of the gays, though.  It's funny. 
[00:19:30]  If he thinks they're shoes.  Yeah, if you want to put the heel of a long shoe in your ass, I'll allow that legally,  even though God hates you.  I mean, you ever make that turn, that turn, go to jail, go to the regular jail, and then  all of a sudden you got to go past the Greens and the Bulwark Park Place with hotels?  Rent too damn high.  And then you pass goal, you only get $200.  How's that going to help me if I make it down to the other end and I hit St. James Place  with the hotels?  Rent too damn high.  This is just a big Monopoly game for you? 
[00:20:00]  Yes, it is.  That's all I've been talking about is Monopoly.  Why?  What's this about?  Governor?  I don't know nothing about that.  Rent too damn it.  You want his closing statement?  No.  I need a thousand quotes from this man.  I think we're about done, unfortunately.  We could go to YouTube.  He's all over the place.  I know.  He's great.  He's going to be a star.  Mr. McMillan, one minute, sir.  In 1994, I walked from Brooklyn to Buffalo, fighting for out of business, going out of  business, lost our lease, housing, homeless crisis, and jobless crisis, providing a roof 
[00:20:30]  over your head, food on the table, and money in your pocket.  I need all mayors of cities to join me, every mayor, executive in the cities in the state  of New York, to join me.  So when Bill Thompson is elected mayor of the city of New York, I want him to cut off my  office so we can help put this together.  I am reducing rent and will reduce rent.  I will reduce the cost for businesses across this state.  Economic growth, job development, the rent two damn high party will create three to six  million jobs in two and a half years or less with a three to six trillion dollars supplant. 
[00:21:00]  Everything that I hear here has done nothing about job creation and economic.  Rent is two damn high parties about jobs, economic, and restoring family values by reducing  the cost of living so that mothers can be home.  The little children join a gang that shoot each other in the street.  Why?  Because mother and dad is not home.  The kids are joining the gang.  We need to stop it.  Reducing the cost of living so that mothers and fathers can be home will eliminate all  of that.  Rent is two damn high.  That's one minute, Mr.  Too damn high. 
[00:21:30]  Rent is two damn high.  Who's going to be playing Cuomo clips today?  This guy is going to get votes.  Of course he is.  Christian Davis is going to vote for him.  I love this guy.  He's going to get votes.  I formally backed him as my candidate.  And it's a perfect catchphrase because if he said, taxes, too damn high.  Too damn high.  That's too white.  Yeah, yeah.  That's too white.  Rent.  Too damn high.  I don't care about the taxes, but I got to pay my rent.  I ain't got to pay my taxes.  I got to pay my rent.  Rent too damn high.  Too damn high. 
[00:22:00]  Too damn high.  Too damn high.  Rent.  It's too damn high.  Rent too damn high is my thing.  And any candidate with a song.  Yeah, Cuomo doesn't have a song, does he?  I don't see Cuomo rappin'.  I don't see Cuomo rappin'.  I don't see Cuomo rappin'.  What the hell is his song?  Damn.  Damn high.  Damn high.  Ha.  It's my name.  Vote for the rent too damn high party.  And Jimmy McMillan November 2nd.  Rent too damn high is my thing.  Jimmy McMillan is my name.  Vote for Jimmy McMillan and the rent too damn high party. 
[00:22:30]  November 2nd.  Yo better tell him about me.  Rent is too damn high.  Yeah.  Rent.  Too damn high.  Yo better tell him about me.  Rent is too damn high.  Ain't nothing to talk about.  Ain't nothing else to talk about.  Yo better tell him about me.  Someone tells me he saw some shit in country.  Yeah.  Someone tells me this guy saw some shit.  Rent is cheaper in me live.  If he was a door gunner in the nom. 
[00:23:00]  And won three bronze stars.  He mowed down a fuck load of people.  And a helicopter door gunner?  Oh yeah yeah.  How many tours did he do?  I don't know.  I don't know but.  Three bronze stars.  Door gunner.  Nom.  With his age.  Where it is.  He probably saw some good shit.  Karate guy.  I bet he fucking knew how to lead a bunch of little children. 
[00:23:30]  Oh to knock them all down.  That's that whole children thing.  We got to save the children.  He probably cut children in half.  With a fucking 50 cal.  Out the door.  Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot.  Just watching fucking dot dot dot dot dot.  Pointy hats explode in a red mist.  Bop bop bop bop bop.  Yeah.  Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop.

[00:24:00]  Wow, well, that'll be nice to hear from him this early.  Oh, yeah.  Let me say hi to Pirate Trucker.  Pirate Trucker, really fast, before we get Jimmy McMillan on the show. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, this guy is freaking brilliant.  He speaks better than Barack Obama.  He's fantastic.  The only problem is that he took a bullet about one inch too far to the right  because he's fucking insane.  He's almost not insane is what you're trying to say.  He's just off.  He's just trying to get support for his community.  He ran too high.  I don't think he's crazy at all.  If he could just get the words right, he would. 
[00:25:00]  He's got a shot.  All right, Pirate Trucker, thank you.  We're going to have him on any second here.  Jimmy McMillan, the candidate for the governorship of New York State.  Cannot wait.  I want to ask him a few questions.  We're watching Full Metal Jacket Clips in the meantime.  Rent to take.  Rafter, man.  How do you shoot women and children?  It's easy.  You just don't lead them as much. 
[00:25:30]  What a great line.  Just an amazing line.  What the hell?  Oh, come on, man.  I saw the hotline hang up.  That's not a good sign.  Uh-oh.  Rent too high.  He's working on it.  What happened, Iraq?  We've got to get him on immediately.  Iraq dropped a cheese sandwich.  Because everyone's going to be trying to get a hold of him today.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is the guy.  Rent too deep.  Ha!  Don't you want to say that all day?  I will.  I'm going to campaign. 
[00:26:00]  Dude, let's get this guy.  All they're showing is Palladino.  No, they're showing Jameek McMillan.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, man.  We've got to get this guy a lot of votes.  Yeah, Kristen thought she was going to be the big, like, kind of, you know, off.  Off the beaten path.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that they'll concentrate on and stuff.  But this guy just blew her out of the water.  We've got to get some of her clips.  There she is.  Kristen Davis.  We haven't backed a candidate since Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  We rarely back a candidate, Anthony.  How's Paul R. Nelson's political career gone? 
[00:26:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I don't know.  We'll have to get an update on that.  But this is the first candidate we're backing since Paul R. Nelson.  What's going on?  I don't know.  They're still trying.  Ha!  Well, Travis had just spoken to him in the back, and he's been calling the number that he spoke  to in the back, and it's saying it's disconnected.  Oh, they work fast, don't they?  Oh, my God.  The phone bill was too damn high.  Is there some kind of phone card thing going on here?  The prepaid.  Oh, my God. 
[00:27:00]  This is the biggest tease ever.  I know.  Come on.  This is the biggest tease ever.  We're so close to talking to Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy McMillan.  Rent is too damn high.  How's Ron Kine?  The Ron Kine.  How's he doing?  I don't know.  Ron Kine.  I can't talk about anything until I see that phone blanking.  Where was that guy from?  I can't even remember the state they were from.  Michigan or Wisconsin?  I think it was Wisconsin.  Yeah, I remember.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah, we didn't even...  I don't even... 
[00:27:30]  Oh, we got it.  We got it.  Okay, good.  Oh, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Jimmy McMillan.  It's too...  Damn, man.  Hey, what's up, brother?  Rent is too damn high, party.  Jimmy McMillan.  Hello, sir.  We saw you on the debates last night making great points.  Yeah, it's a reality.  Some people look at it like it's a joke.  It's not...  It's nothing...  It's the cancer.  It's all the problems.  99.9% of the problems we have. 
[00:28:00]  They're not talking about it.  They're beating around the bush because they're playing that same old political game,  and the people don't put me here to put an end to it.  I tried to do my best to let the...  Every question that was asked of me, I turned it around involving rent because the children,  which is every child is my child, my children need daddy to step up.  Last night, daddy tried to step up.  I hope my children can appreciate it.  Well, you certainly are getting a lot of attention for the party. 
[00:28:30]  The rent's too damn high.  I think you kicked Cuomo's ass last night.  I just want to say that immediately.  Cuomo looked like a business-as-usual politician.  Business-as-usual politician.  Yeah, he agreed with me.  Oh, business-as-usual politician.  He agreed with me.  They would have pat me on the back and shaken my hand.  He certainly did.  Let me tell you how great you are.  We agree with you, and we're white, sir.  Yes.  Because I come from the taxes are too damn high, Marty. 
[00:29:00]  But, you know, you've got to pay that rent.  You've got to pay that rent.  How would you get the rent down, though, when a lot of these greedy landlords are charging people way too much?  Okay, in New York, we have something called the Rent Guidelines Board, Rent Control Board, Rent Stabilization Board.  They allow landlords to raise rent with violations.  And they have—they were allowed to break the law.  And who allowed them to do that?  The governor, Andrew Cuomo.  I mean, the attorney general.  But I didn't—I don't like to talk about people in front of—you know, as a martial expert, like I said last night, people know what's wrong. 
[00:29:30]  Let me talk about what's wrong so we can try to—I'll say to you, if you stole something from me, I'll say to you, okay, Keith, go ahead on.  But I'll never talk—I'll never be your friend again.  So, but this is—I'm just going directly to the—our children don't have the time for them to play that game of just blaming and blaming.  What you going to do?  I talk about what I was going to do.  But bringing the rent down, you have landlords with violations.  They'll still be given a green light to raise the rent.  $900 a week for a room, $3,000 for a studio, $4,000 for a one-bedroom, $8,000 nearly nine for a two-bedroom. 
[00:30:00]  Our children can't afford to live here.  It is New York, sir, and I must say, isn't there an option to perhaps leave the area that is very expensive?  No, I have—the president has—in the Recovery Act is a plan to help the landlord.  The question is, we don't have anybody smart enough.  The people who are elected now into office have been in the George Bush administration.  If they don't leave, that's nothing I will be able to do. 
[00:30:30]  So here's what I did.  I declared an economic state of emergency to get past all of them that have given me the power to reduce the rent.  Say like if you were building on it, and you say, well, I can't make ends meet because you lowered the rent.  Well, I have prepared a package called a net operating loss.  All you have to do is fill that out, and for the next four years, you're not going to miss anything.  Now, now, wait, wait, Jimmy.  First of all, Jimmy, you're sounding a little too much like a politician there.  You're scaring us.  We like when you break it down to the rent is too damn high. 
[00:31:00]  Too damn high.  For the children.  You've got to sound like that to get the point, because no one is talking about this but me, of the rent too damn high.  See, there you go.  Too damn high.  You've got to get those sound bites going, sir, because the media will pick up on the sound bites.  I've got to ask you now something that I was a little—I need a little more details on.  The bulldozing of the mountains upstate.  We're a little confused, sir.  A little confused.  You didn't have enough time to really elaborate on that.  What's the story with that, sir? 
[00:31:30]  New York State needs to become an independent state.  I'm an Army Corps engineer.  Like seceding from the Union?  I'm an Army engineer.  You can bulldoze those mountains.  You can create your own industries, your own plants, your own cable company, your own cell phone company, your own telephone company.  Get away from Verizon and cable company.  In New York, you know cable companies have cut off the football games for certain channels.  Why hold the people hostage when you're an independent state?  You're like a punk state.  You're letting everyone come in.  This is the capital of the world. 
[00:32:00]  They attacked the World Trade Center in New York State.  Why aren't you living up to your standards?  Why?  Because we don't have people in power to do that.  So I'm just bringing a new level of thinking, agreeing with President Barack Obama, and we can put a man on the moon.  We can do this.  So I'm going to pull those mountains because people will complain.  Oh, the environment.  I don't know all that.  No, we're going to take it so far out of your way, you won't even smell nothing that we're doing.  You won't even see it.  It'll be up in the boonies where nobody knows about, and all that land's being wasted because it could have power plants on it and waterworks and everything else. 
[00:32:30]  But what about the people that like the mountains?  Well, there's enough mountains for them to crawl on.  There's plenty of mountains.  You guys make a perfect sense.  Of course.  There's plenty of mountains.  Why are we so concerned about these damn mountains when we can build power plants?  You know what I'm saying?  Just go get another damn mountain.  Oh, man, Jimmy.  Sir, what kind of a...  I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir.  You're in the military.  You're probably the only guy with real military service, too. 
[00:33:00]  You did...  How much military service?  No, no, no.  No, no.  Tyler Demo, who was a captain in the army for 11 years.  Oh, was he really?  Okay.  Yeah, he is my brother, regardless.  Regardless, yeah, because you guys both served.  You know, I don't care what you're not going to...  And he and I became such a hell of a good friend because of our military connection.  He'd know about me being a disabled veteran.  I'm exposed to Agent Orange.  That's why I had my gloves on last night.  I came in this morning.  I was sick as hell because it was cold in there, man.  If I had put those gloves on, I would have had to go to the emergency room. 
[00:33:30]  Circulation in your hands a little...  Yeah, yeah, huh?  Well, you've got to keep your hands warm.  That's why the black gloves...  Yeah, definitely, definitely.  Yeah, all right.  I was scared you were going to strangle some of your opponents last night.  So you were in Vietnam, a door gunner, I see, on your website.  Yeah, I was in Vietnam.  They gave me so many bronze stars and so many medals.  I'm a karate expert. 
[00:34:00]  I'm a general Westmore.  He came and got me, and we were searching for POW, such as John McCain, who I call a punk.  Now we have to try to help find you and get you out.  Now you're out.  You haven't even thought about us.  You've even disapproved legislation that will help us, how funds we need to take care of our family.  I have deformed children, and I can't have children.  One of my daughters that was born, she had her foot coming at the top of her head.  The other one didn't have any skin at all.  And I had a son born who had his head in the middle of his back.  The chemical...  Are you kidding me?  That's that Agent Orange?  From the Agent Orange, and the government's still denied. 
[00:34:30]  So I said, I need to get into a political position to be able to...  This is the back door that I'm doing.  I'm trying to sneak in the back door.  There are many other issues.  All my brother veterans that must be addressed, they are totally being ignored.  Children in New York State suffer from autism.  But when I check, their fathers or their uncles are someone connected on the Vietnam.  All right, wait, you know, suffering from autism is nothing compared to having a foot coming out of your head.  How, how, how, hold on, hold on.  How's your daughter with the foot coming out of her head? 
[00:35:00]  Because of the chemicals.  The chemicals are how.  No, she's dead.  Oh, she didn't make it?  I don't think so.  The daughter didn't make it with the foot coming out of the head?  She couldn't be born with that.  None of my kids couldn't be.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  The woman who was born has spinal...  He visits his kids in charge.  It's just about a narrow margin.  But I, I did, I went through a lot of tests before my son was born.  And after my son was born, I said, I said, I'm not going to put another woman through that.  And, uh, it's, uh, and that's what I have.  I'm a single man. 
[00:35:30]  I chose to be single because I don't, uh, I don't, uh, this is how I'm living.  I'm living taking care of all the children who, the families who are having healthy children.  You don't want to go through that.  I've lived through it now for all my life.  And I'm just fighting now for everyone to be happy.  There's a short life.  At any given moment, you have a heart attack in your bone or a stroke or whatever it is  in your bones.  And for all those people who are sick as hell, you got a, you got a brother, a father right  here in me.  That's, that's, that's noble.  That's very noble.  And, and, and the fact that, you know, God takes care of things. 
[00:36:00]  And, uh, you know, I'm glad, you know, the daughter, that would have been terrible.  She obviously would have been a foot taller than everybody in her class.  And, and that's terrible, but, uh, but, you know, I would have made a clown show out of  it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't, you don't need that.  That's terrible.  I'm, I'm sorry.  That's, that's terrible.  You would have had to buy clown shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Hey, uh, Jimmy McMillan, you've been talking too long without saying your catchphrase.  Come on, sir.  What's wrong?  I need everybody to go to my website and send us a dollar because we need to get out 
[00:36:30]  there.  We don't have any, we have $16 on our account.  I need everybody to get $16 in the, in the war chest, uh, sir, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah.  What's your, what's your website for people that want to, uh, want to go there?  Rhett is too damn high.  Rhett is too damn high.  R E N T I S T O O D A M N.  We're white.  We know how to spell.  Too damn high.  Is that .com or .org? 
[00:37:00]  .org.  .org.  .org.  Who's got the .com?  They probably got it there.  It probably goes there.  There are two different tools.  They took down out of my party name and I had T O O on the ballot before, but when they  took two out my name, I took them to court.  And on June 2nd, I mean June 12th of this year, the federal judge ordered it back with the  violation of the first amendment.  So we took out the T O O. We put the letter to in for the ballot.  Right.  T O O is still my party name.  Oh, that's still the party name.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I gotcha. 
[00:37:30]  Oh my God.  Dude.  Damn high.  Damn high.  I hear you.  I like the Frederick Douglass, uh, facial hair too.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's looking good.  Well, uh, any, any, any other questions for, uh, Jimmy?  Uh, I don't know.  When did you, when did you decide to run, sir?  When did you decide to run?  When did you say you'd had enough and you had to run?  Barack Obama needs help.  And I realized.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's got a tough. 
[00:38:00]  Are you hanging in there, Ann?  You all right?  Oh yeah, I'm fine.  All right.  You're good?  Oh yeah.  All right.  Hey.  Now he's trying to be governor and mayor.  He's trying to be everything.  He needs help, but his position, we don't even have a clue what this man is doing.  If he needs help, I want to see you as the man that goes in to help him.  Uh, Jimmy McMillan, you talked, you talked about gay marriage, but they didn't give you  enough time last night.  No.  What's your, what's your stance on the gay marriage thing?  Well, they asked me, Paul Blake, I said, if you want to marry, I'm married, you want to  marry, shoot.  Right.  I'm not, I'm not, I can't, I can't tell you who you're not to be happy with. 
[00:38:30]  You want to, you want to marry, you want to, you want to marry a cow, you want to marry  a rubber doll.  Paul, I know some guys that have passion with rubber dolls and, and different, uh, plastic  objects.  No, you're talking to three of them.  Our own, Dan, he uses a flashlight.  We're not talking, we're not talking about the issues with him, though.  What about abortion, sir?  These are big issues.  These are, these are big issues.  Like I told you about my daughter, my, the lady's being pregnant for me with these to  farm children. 
[00:39:00]  It is, it is a medical, uh, when it comes to, I wouldn't be here if my mother would have  had an abortion, so I don't know how to go, which way to go with that, because so many  people have so many questions about that.  Even if you give them a little small view, someone else will be able to come up and say,  well, how about this and how about that?  So, well, that's a tough one.  They've been talking about this in the federal court for I don't know how long, and I can't  solve it.  I can't solve it in a, in a one-second conversation.  Well, you're in a tough position, because, uh, you would have had a daughter with a foot coming  out of her head.  I know, that's bad.  So, what do you do?  What do you do with that?  Oh, you can't have that. 
[00:39:30]  You do what I mean.  Didn't he have a son with a head in his back or something?  A head on his back.  On his back.  Well, he could see people coming.  He could swim like a submarine.  Actually, that would be really good if you live in a ghetto.  Have a head on your back like that.  My God, that's crazy.  Who's going to jump you?  Ah, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's my man.  We are backing you.  Jimmy McMillan.  One more.  Death penalty.  Thank you.  Rent is too damn high.  Thank you very much.  What about the death penalty, sir?  Well, I'm a vet.  I believe if you, let me just say this here. 
[00:40:00]  In my community, I've had four young men to take, to become judge and jury of their own  to take these children's lives.  They think they're bad.  Or they walk around with their parents hanging down in the gun, carrying the style.  You know, I want to send a message.  I want to send a message.  I'm a vet.  I kill a lot of people in the war.  And I'm saying, I want to say, you think you're bad, huh?  Yeah.  You killed someone on your own.  But we, the people, are going to get together and kill your ass.  You know, you were judge and jury, but we're going to get together and be judge and jury 
[00:40:30]  to take, we can't have you around society.  You want to do 20 years and get out and talk about it, or do half of it because of good  behavior, but at first you kill, life is gone.  Yeah.  You know, I don't believe in you doing that.  So somebody, I like to get him in a ring and whip his ass myself.  Jimmy, can I ask you a question about your service, which, thank you, I always like,  you know, with thank you for your service to this country.  How, how, how many, how many confirms would you say you had in the NAMM? 
[00:41:00]  Every day in the heaviest combat zone in Vietnam, it's more than I can count.  It would be well over.  I was a marksman with a rifle and a pistol.  I was a John Wayne and a, every, to defend my brother's soldiers, I couldn't give you  that number, but the number would be well over $500,000.  I got it, Jimmy.  Wow.  Number's too damn hot.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Well, you know, and, and you, you paid for it through, uh, you know, the Agent Orange and 
[00:41:30]  stuff.  And, uh, and now look, you're trying to make things right, right?  Sounds like God got him back with the daughter with the foot coming out.  My children need help.  They can't afford to live in this country or anywhere in the state of New York.  And daddy is going to fight for my children.  Like I did in Vietnam, they fight to help get my soldiers out.  I remember a general told all the soldiers one day, he, we were all outside and had to  go into the mountains.  He told them clearly, if you follow McMillan, you're going home. 
[00:42:00]  Some of those didn't, they never made it home.  But Jimmy McMillan is here today.  And I'll say to the people in New York, if you vote for Jimmy McMillan, it's going  to be all right.  The same thing.  Follow Jimmy and you'll be okay.  Follow Jimmy.  You're like Rambo.  No kidding.  He was like Rambo.  You know what?  You know what?  When I watched everything, I said, wow, this guy, this guy, all that, the strap, all  of his, he had those weapons strapped around him.  That was me in Vietnam.  And I was a, I was a, I was a bad man fighting for my soldiers. 
[00:42:30]  I became a doctor.  The doctor got killed.  I performed surgery in the field and a lot of things.  I cut off limbs.  I took grass and used it as thread and needles just to show open wounds.  Damn.  I did, I did, I did all of that in Vietnam.  Took metal out of, out of your body.  I had to decapitate half our heads and all this stuff.  Oh, man.  It was hell for the country.  That sounds like it.  I think someone had to do it.  Damn.  Like with you guys, someone has to be able to present good radio to the people. 
[00:43:00]  And you guys have to do it.  And so I'm here again.  And I have to do it.  I think, I think we, go ahead, sir.  Go on vacation.  I want people to go on vacation again.  I want people to live again.  People can't, don't have money to go no place.  Tell me about it.  I want to wake that up.  I want people to work all day to pay.  Did you hear about Bank of America?  Now I'm going to go back to foreclosure.  Back to foreclosing on houses.  I had to close up my pool a little early because the heater was costing so much money.  I had to close my pool up yesterday. 
[00:43:30]  It doesn't want to be doing that.  The propane is too damn high.  Yes.  Too damn high.  Too damn high.  Ah, Jimmy.  You know.  I think what we should do for Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy McMillan, I think you should tell everyone to grab a shovel and let's get that  mountain out of the way.  Get some of those upstate mountains, flatten them out, fill in the valleys, and let's start  building power plants.  If you grab a shovel, Jimmy, I'm grabbing a shovel. 
[00:44:00]  I'm right with you.  And we'll follow you right upstate and start digging out that mountain.  We've got to do this together because what Cablevision has done to the people and State  of New York has held them hostage.  We can't watch football games.  We can't watch the World Series.  I want my own cable company.  I'm not going to count on anyone anymore to do anything with the State of New York.  That's crazy.  Should get FIO, sir.  It's terrific.  You see the frigging Yankee game last night?  The Texas score?  Too damn high.  We couldn't get it because Cablevision had a blackout because they're fighting against 
[00:44:30]  the network for money.  I hear you.  They're holding us hostage, Jimmy.  They're holding us hostage.  I'm a veteran.  You're not going to hold me hostage, Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I got a very important question for you about policy.  What's your policy on Second Amendment?  What do you mean by that?  What's my policy on the Second Amendment?  Second Amendment, right to bear arms.  Where do you stand?  I'm a Vietnam veteran.  You have a home.  I do believe that.  Right now, things are so wild.  Well, I'm in a neighborhood where I've been shot at four or five times. 
[00:45:00]  I'm an independent investigator for what I do.  So, they wouldn't give me a license to carry a pistol.  So, you know, I start carrying my nunchucks and there's other things that I can carry.  Of course.  Wow.  I'm a client.  How insane is that a Vietnam vet can't carry?  I would take needles.  I would take spikes.  I would take a pile and throw it.  But, you know, you have a home.  The Constitution gives you that right to bear arms, as you know, a couple of months ago.  They pass.  You can stop people from carrying arms.  But in New York State, they will try to stop you. 
[00:45:30]  But under, if you, the state law will apprehend you.  But if you file a lawsuit in federal court, they'll let you go.  You need to learn.  You know, state, federal law exempts state law.  But people just, you know, they don't know that.  So, you're for, you know, the right to bear arms, huh?  That's good.  I'm for the right to bear arms.  That's good.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Because that's a big issue with me.  I'm a strong advocate of the Second Amendment.  I belong to the National Rifle Association. 
[00:46:00]  I'm a vet, man.  I'm a value act.  Yeah, exactly.  I hear you.  I hear you.  Anthony loves you.  Too bad you're black.  No, I love the black man.  You love the black man?  He's working for the people.  He's working for his people.  This is a noble effort.  Do you call yourself Papa Smurf?  Yeah, I teach the kids call me that.  And then I wrote it on my book, Papa Smurf.  Everybody loves Papa Smurf.  So I am Jimmy Papa Smurf McMillan.  I like it.  And we're studying you here, sir. 
[00:46:30]  Do you have something on earthquakes?  What do you mean?  Why?  Something on earthquakes?  I don't understand.  I put something on my website about Haiti and be involved in earthquakes by the Haitian people.  They haven't been given any of the money that was raised for them.  They hold that money up.  They're not giving it to those people.  And I will not donate another dime on anything because of that.  Oh, damn.  It seems like there's a little corruption down there, right?  It's crazy.  A little corruption going on.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:47:00]  No, no.  This is Washington, D.C.  The money's held up here.  They won't send it out.  All the millions of dollars they raised.  So it's a fight between the Republicans and stuff.  And one man is doing it.  For whatever reason, you don't intercept nothing like that.  And I'm not going to donate again.  I would donate it directly.  It's got to help the people.  Right.  Business as usual.  My God.  All right.  Jimmy McMillan at The Rent.  The Rent is too damn high, boy. 
[00:47:30]  Damn high party.  Go to rentis2damnhigh.org.  And donate.  See his platform.  See what he's all about.  But he told us it's the number two.  Yeah, the number two.  He said the letter two, but we're helping him out.  Yeah, yeah, the number two.  The number two instead of spelling it out.  I got to tell you something so funny.  Yeah.  Last night before the debate, we all had to pull numbers.  And you will never guess what number I pulled.  Two.  The number two.  That's a sign. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, Palladimo pulled number one.  And I pulled number two.  I said, oh, I'm not.  I said, you know what number two is?  You know, number one.  My father told me, son, number one, I want you to come home to school and wash your dishes.  Number three, I want you to go out there and rent the yard tomorrow.  Number four, I'm going to get it.  What's number two?  Well, go get the toilet paper.  I'll tell you when we come out.  Now, I like that.  Oh, damn.  He got two all over the place.  That's right, Chip.  Oh, man.  Very good, sir.  Rett is too damn high. 
[00:48:30]  Well, we're going to be keeping our eye on you, Jimmy McMillan, in this gubernatorial race.  And I wish you the best, sir.  We're going to get you a lot of votes, sir.  Yes.  It's too damn high.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Good luck to you.  The great Jimmy McMillan.  It's too damn high.  Rett too damn high is my thing.  Jimmy McMillan is my name.  He's crazy.  But no.  Jimmy McMillan, November 2nd.  All right, look.  It's too damn high is my thing.  There's a foot growing out of his head.  Jimmy McMillan is my name. 
[00:49:00]  And a head growing out the back.  Rett too damn high.  And I think he said he killed 500,000 people.  No, 500,000, 2,000 people.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  He goes every day in the heaviest combat zone in Nam.  I can see that.  500 to 1,000 people.  And he's stitching people up.  I think most of the stuff he was saying was the real thing.  I really do.  But then I heard.  I didn't hear the crazy.  He was hanging out with Westmoreland, trying to find POWs.  I don't know.  Why not?  Why wouldn't he be one of those guys?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't he be a POW finding guy? 
[00:49:30]  I'm not doubting any man's military service.  I'm saying, you know, God bless him.  Maybe when you said Westmoreland, maybe Westmoreland kind of let a group of them.  Like supervisor or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the Agent Orange thing.  Too damn hot.  He's wearing the black gloves, so he's got something on.  Circulation problem.  It's probably the sweet blood.  I think he's got the sugar.  Red is too damn hot.  Too damn hot, man.  I like that guy.  He was great.  He was great. 
[00:50:00]  Good.  We got to call him almost every day until this thing is over.  Upstate New York.  Big X throw it.  He just wants to plow over that.  Yeah.  You can't not acknowledge upstate New York, right?  He wants to plow it over.  He's acknowledging it.  Get the bulldozers and start building power plants up there so kids can come out with fucking feet on their head.  He literally might as well come out and say, oh, you faggots who like skiing, those days are over.  Those days are over.  Rent's too damn hot.  You can't plow mountains. 
[00:50:30]  Holy cheese, man.  Fucking love that guy.  Guy's great.  All right.  He's going to be all over the place.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Oh, he will.  Believe me.  This guy, he's got charisma.  How bad do you want to say just rent is too damn hot?  The best one was score was too damn hot.  Well, I know who I'm pulling the lever for.  Oh, yeah.  Paladino.  Oh, yeah.  No.  No, you've got to go Jimmy McMillan now.  I've got to go for Jimmy. 
[00:51:00]  He's an ass.  I know he is.  But you've got to do it.  We haven't backed the candidates since Paul R. Nelson.  I think Jimmy will jack your taxes a lot more than Paladino will.  Oh, I know.  But Cuomo's got this knocked.  He's got this wrapped up.  I don't understand, like, the Post endorsed Cuomo.  How do newspapers get to endorse people?  It's like, I don't get it.  I don't know.  Why do we care what the paper thinks?  Everybody endorses them.  Why does their endorsement?  What is an endorsement?  It's like, who gives a shit what you think?  It means if you read our paper, then you should be voting for this guy.  Yeah, it's stupid. 
[00:51:30]  Then it's like, oh, well, look at that.  It's like, we should give a fuck what they think.  Endorse them in your own private time.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, I give a shit what the Post endorses.  Who you're voting for?  So what?  Do we have a famous Paul R. Nelson commercial we could play in to break?  Paul R. Nelson.  One of the really good ones about the Eskimos and the fucking...  Yeah, that was a good one.  And the sex experiments.  That was a great one.  Does Jimmy McMillan have commercials running?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  If he has $16 in his war chest.  $16 in the war chest. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I got more in my wallet today, and I didn't even hit the ATM.  Took a pickled punk of a kid with a foot in her head around.  That would make some money right there.  $5 of you.  He's had a daughter with a foot growing out of him.  I had a son with a head on his back.  Holy shit.  That's fucked up right there.  Just give me one of them.  We're going to play a Paul R. Nelson ad going into break.  One of our favorite candidates of all time.  But Jimmy McMillan might be the new favorite, right?  You know, we only back winners, Opie, on this show.  That's right.  Only back the winners. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  We'll be back.  But first this.  Ten years ago, liberal lawyer Ron Kind was elected to Congress, and he's done almost nothing in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing, because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron Kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance.  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public buildings.  Ron Kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual leaders.  He even voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag. 
[00:53:00]  For Congress, Ron Kind is the wrong kind.  The right kind of congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports Wisconsin values.  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration, to end our dependence on foreign oil,  to win the war on terror, and to defend traditional marriage.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Paid for by Paul R. Nelson for Congress. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, Rock, we didn't like that one, man.  What happened to the Eskimos and the probes?  And the sex probes.  Yeah, the probes on the teenage genitals.  What, you're lightening up on us?  You got another one for us?  All right, we'll try this one going into break.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day,  what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex. 
[00:54:00]  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research,  Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease,  Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered,  and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies  with probes connected to their genitalia. 
[00:54:30]  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Paul R. Nelson, Paul R. Nelson, thank God almighty. 
[00:55:00]  Paul R. Nelson, I have to inform you.  Paul R. Nelson, I'm Paul R. Nelson, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, I'm Paul R. Nelson, I'm Paul R. Nelson, I'm Paul R. Nelson, Paul R. Nelson, Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:55:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have to inform you that Paul R. Nelson has been shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.  Paul R. Nelson has been shot and killed in Dallas, Texas. 
[00:56:00]  Paul R. Nelson, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  Dean Cook.  Hey, this is Jim Florentine. 
[00:56:30]  This is Louis C.K.  Hey, everybody, it's Joel McHale.  Hey, this is Howie Mandel, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  It says here I can be profane.  Avoid the word cunt.  All right.  Find yourself a girl and settle down.  Live a simple life in a quiet town.  Stay as you go.  Stay as you go.  Stay as you go.  So did you watch the whole game last night, Ann?  Or did you bow? 
[00:57:00]  I actually was watching it.  Nothing was happening except them losing.  And then I found myself waking up on the couch going like, oh, what?  Really?  And went up to bed.  And then I took out the iPhone, and I went to my MLB app, and I'm just like, I hit it,  and I'm like.  Isn't that the worst?  Yeah, yeah.  You hit it going, maybe a miracle, maybe something.  Oh, blowout.  Yeah.  Eat nothing.  Cliff Lee was unstoppable last night. 
[00:57:30]  So irritating to watch that at the end.  Pettit pitched a good game with two runs in the first.  Pettit did good.  I think Texas is just a better team.  Fuck, the fact that the Yankees have lost two straight after that amazing come-from-behind win,  that should have broken Texas' back.  But they've just kicked the shit out of them twice in a row since then.  They hung right in there.  So you missed hoarders last night then, Ann?  But you didn't watch your Yankees, and you didn't watch hoarders.  That was a good night of TV for you.  Which hoarders was it?  The one with the cancer?  I don't know.  Like I said, I have a tough time watching those type of shows. 
[00:58:00]  I was watching hoarders, though, earlier, because I found out hoarders is available on Netflix.  So I was just like, boom, I'm going to watch hoarders on my own motherfucking time.  So I watched some, and just, again, was just livid with the, oh, well.  Now she's very upset that this crazy woman, of course.  She was upset that a piece of tile by her front door, she's got like square Takata tile coming in,  and you could barely see it until they started moving shit, was cracked in three pieces. 
[00:58:30]  And she took one of the pieces and put it on a table.  And she was freaking out that one piece of tile was missing, one piece of a broken tile.  And they have one of the cleaning guys, and he's like, um, yeah, she's apparently upset that a piece of tile is missing,  and you could understand how this could be mistaken for rubbish.  And then he looks at the camera and kind of looks down like, she's fucking crazy.  Oh, good. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's great.  Good for fucking him.  Love the show, because it's as infuriating as Jocktober, and even more so.  Why?  Because only a few Jocktober shows do I want to squirt gasoline on and burn their station down.  But every hoarder's house, I just want coated in gas and lit up with her and all her items in it.  Why don't we start a hoarder's company?  It seems pretty lucrative.  There's a lot of hoarders out there.  They say like there's three million of them in the country. 
[00:59:30]  Three million hoarders?  Three million hoarders.  That sounds about right.  Three million dickheads.  That means everyone has a hoarder in their life, just about.  Or knows someone, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  It's a little too close.  I say you give them a suitcase and say you've got ten minutes to fill this suitcase up with your prized possessions,  and then we're torching the house.  How about a day?  No, ten minutes.  I'm with Anthony.  Ten fucking minutes.  As the bulldozers are revving up. 
[01:00:00]  Turn it into a game show.  Yeah, yeah.  A Japanese game show.  And they've got a slow-mo her running out of the house with the suitcase diving as a big blade from the bulldozer.  As the guy is doing old-school dynamite.  Yeah, yeah.  In slow motion.  He's got the T-handle that he pushes down, and the house just explodes.  It's exploding as she's running.  Love it!  Cat shit and fucking boxes of worthless paper flying in the air.  Oh, those women are fucked.  Is it mostly women?  Mostly women.  I wonder what that's about. 
[01:00:30]  Why mostly women?  I have a problem with someone dying.  It's always like, well, this woman had, I was watching one, she had a wreath up on the wall.  A wreath with a little Christmas ornament, and I think it was July, and it was in the middle.  It said, I love you on it.  She goes, the wreath is very important to me.  It was made by a friend who just recently died.  So I put it up on the wall, and I'm not taking it down.  And then the counselor's like, what would you feel if we just took that down?  Would you feel like you're abandoning your friend and forgetting her, even though, you know, she's passed away? 
[01:01:00]  And then, I don't know.  She just starts crying, and you want to smack her in the face.  Well, how long ago did the friend die?  That's key.  Yeah, it was the day before, I think.  Oh, well.  No, I'm not sure.  1982.  Usually, it's way before.  Look at this video.  I know it's radio.  I'm sorry.  This is insane.  It's boxes of nothing.  It's toys.  Where there's just pathways.  Stuffed animals.  Look, she's got to walk over a table full of shit to get to this one little spot on the couch. 
[01:01:30]  And this is why I think it's all bullshit, because if she could keep her couch clean enough so she could watch a little TV around her junk, it means you could be cured.  Yeah, you cleaned a little spot to sit your fat ass down on.  They're all fat asses.  Right.  Just continue cleaning.  This is the woman that had someone she knew, Fat Jim Norton, it looks like.  Oh, my God.  That does look like me.  It's Jimmy and Roland.  A fireman that she knew died at the World Trade Center, and she lost her fucking mind. 
[01:02:00]  Lost her mind.  Was she banging him?  Was she a wife?  No, it was a cousin or something.  No, because she's got a husband over here or some shit, and now everything she saves, like any flag.  There was this piece of shit chair.  You know those beach chairs with the canvas, and they're very low?  I hate those.  Yeah.  There was a piece of shit one that was made out of, like, material that looked like a flag, and it was ripped up and fucking rotted.  And she's like, I can't if I feel like I'm throwing away a flag.  And I say, shut up. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  Shut up.  Enough.  And there was a couple of hot daughters in, like, an episode, and you just felt bad for them.  God, will they be easy lays?  Oh, my God.  Are they going to be just a clean room, and you're getting your dick sucked?  That's all you need.  More than four feet of space to lay down and fucking tidy up.  Yeah, she doesn't have to push fucking newspapers from 1980 off the bed.  If we're going to start our hoarder's company, this guy's got a great idea.  We want to go with dynamite. 
[01:03:00]  We want to go with the suitcase.  We want to go with the Japanese game show type of thing.  Ten minutes to get your shit out before we blow up your house.  Get your shit out.  Ken's got a good idea, though, to help us out.  Go ahead, Ken.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, what you got to do is you just got to open up one of the windows, put a big tube on it,  and then get the biggest vacuum money can buy and suck all that shit out of the house in, like, 30 seconds.  Yeah, with the people in it, too. 
[01:03:30]  Just start sucking the shit out of the house.  Oh, here's the ugly daughter.  Accept it as the way it is.  She's like...  For years, I've just thought, okay, that's the way we're living.  Oh, well, we've got to deal with it.  It's all just, like, a mountain of stuff.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pause.  Why does she have to be a hoarder?  Because her mom's a hoarder.  No, this is her mom's shit in her bedroom.  The mom...  The mother is such a selfish cunt.  Are you kidding me?  She ran out of room in her shithole, so now she starts stacking shit in her daughter's room.  The daughters now... 
[01:04:00]  There's two bedrooms.  They could each have their own room.  Right.  They have bunk beds at 14 and, like, 12 or something like that.  I don't know what the other girl is.  So you got teenage girls that need their room.  Need their room so they could diddle themselves with their little vibrators.  And ride their bedposts, right?  Yes.  And sneak their older boyfriend and his camouflage jacket in and out.  What a selfish fucking bitch.  Exactly.  The daughter, I mean.  I know.  Support your mommy.  Give her more room.  I know it's all about...  That bed looks pretty clear.  I know it's all about the ugly daughter, but that's completely fucking insane. 
[01:04:30]  She looks like Fan.  Who has sympathy?  She looks like Fan.  Who has sympathy for these fucking people?  She's taking over her daughter's room with the fucking junk.  Yeah, with the junk.  And then one of the daughters actually did start, like, hoarding stuffed animals in the closet.  And the counselor had to come over and be like, you know, hey, I see some things happening here.  What are you?  But the daughter was like, oh, no, you can take this one, throw it out.  I don't care about that.  Whatever.  Fuck this. 
[01:05:00]  Like, she was throwing shit away.  The mother, though?  A stark raving lunatic.  Look at the daughter.  I think the other daughter talks, too.  And the other daughter's a little more sensible.  She's just like, she's the younger one to completely fuck this.  My stuff.  They can't use their bedroom all too much.  All too much.  I share a room with my sister.  Nice view.  The room's a mess.  Ashley doesn't like it.  She's more worried about, like, her own space and stuff than, like, I am.  I mean, she's going to be a hoarder, too, probably.  My name is Ashley.  I'm 12 years old, and I'm Dawn's daughter. 
[01:05:30]  I see my house as a giant trash can.  She is.  There's stuff everywhere.  They say, clean a room.  I'm like, I can't.  There's nowhere to put anything.  Look at my phone go off.  Everything is at least heartbroken, something we can't use, and I want it all out.  I don't want to live like this anymore.  Sure.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Would you take her in, Uncle Paul?  What kid would be happy living like this?  They are my total world. 
[01:06:00]  They are the greatest things.  Oh, are they?  They are my life.  Who's that pussywip zilch?  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on a second.  Who's that pussywip zilch of a husband?  The fucking husbands of these hoarders are ball-less fucking faggots that won't just tell the wife, throw your fucking shit out or get out.  That's it.  And then she's talking about how her children are my everything, my life.  Oh, so you hoard shit in their room?  She's not hot enough to deal with her bullshit. 
[01:06:30]  No, she's a pig.  If she was like a Playboy model, then you'd let her hoard all she wants?  I'll hoard all you want.  She's sucking your dick.  She's hot.  She's bringing hot friends over.  She's like, I don't care.  Bringing in wheelbarrows of trinkets because you don't care because she's hot.  There's 20 cats shitting in your mouth at night.  You don't care.  Let's be honest with each other.  If she wasn't such a pig, you wouldn't care.  How horrible a hoarder is is directly proportional to how hot she is.  She's hoarding pictures of her big tits all over the house. 
[01:07:00]  You wouldn't mind as much.  You're hoarding cum all over the house.  She's saving her duties in plastic bags and covering up the stairwell like the last one we did.  But she's hot, so who gives a fuck?  Her stripper friend's underpants, she's hoarding them.  You're like, yeah, it's all right.  It's just a whole room of underpants that are dirty.  Little duty stains.  Dirty underpants.  Little duty and yellow stains.  Then a little discharge and some red.  Yeah.  And they do jumping jacks at the wrong time of the month.  But if you're a pig and a hoarder at the same time, oh boy. 
[01:07:30]  If you're a pig and you leave the newspaper on the table, you should be thrown out into the street.  It should be rolled up and you should be hit in the face with it.  All my girls' underwear look like Jerry Garcia's shirt.  Come on, that's funny.  It's all tie-dyed.  All right.  Maybe Deadhead's shirt.  How about tie-dye?  Wavy Gravy's shirt.  No, you've got to put a person in there.  Just tie-dye it.  I guess that would have worked.  Yeah, because I didn't understand Jerry Garcia.  He's dead.  Yeah, but he wore tie-dye.  I didn't know what he wore, though. 
[01:08:00]  Explaining this is very hurtful and hard for me.  Why?  You want your girlfriend's underpants to look like a splatter of different colors.  Yes!  Yes!  Like a painter's palette.  That's good.  What is...  Hold on, man.  Oh, shit.  Thank God Keith called, because we almost forgot about something.  Oh, fuck.  Keith in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead, Keith.  Good morning, boy. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Hey, Keith.  Hey, I'm a little worried about Sam's mom.  Bobby.  Yeah, Bobby.  Yeah.  Bobby's a star, by the way.  The feedback on Sam's mom, Bobby, yesterday.  Off the hook.  Yo.  The only Bobby I've heard with greater issues is Michael Caine's Bobby in Dressed to Kill.  Not a laugh, but a damn good reference.  I'm so glad.  Oh, my underwear joke is now in the mist somewhere. 
[01:09:00]  Your underwear joke is Pryor's monkey in the fucking...  Monkey's dick in the ear bit compared to mine.  Everyone's just laughing.  They love the quiet.  That was a monumental bomb.  Just a kill.  Yeah, Keith.  Sam's mom could be a hoarder.  Bobby could be a hoarder.  But you reminded us.  Sam was supposed to bring in stuff from Bobby.  And I heard, and we forgot until this very moment, that Sam has brought in a shitload 
[01:09:30]  of stuff that Bobby put together for this show today.  The little collection.  I think we're going to do it later in the show after Ian Halpern does his thing for us  today.  Uh-oh.  We've got to beat up Ian Halpern, too, because that sex tape, that Tiger Woods sex tape is  fake.  Fake.  Fake.  Fake!  Oh, that hoarder's guy is a convicted sex offender?  Wow, what a surprise.  What did he call himself?  Princess something?  Sir Patrick.  Sir Patrick.  He dressed in, like, Asian garb and had a big collection of Asian garbage in his house. 
[01:10:00]  I think he was Asian.  I think he was Asian.  But he's not Asian.  But he sold a lot of it.  Made some money.  Like, he did have some valuable stuff in there.  But it turns out now he's a convicted sex offender.  What did he do, Dan?  What did he do?  Let's see.  Well...  Can we do the game show music as you read what he did?  Oh, yeah.  It just makes it a little more fun for everybody.  You got some game show music, E-Rock. 
[01:10:30]  And also, get Sam down here.  We got to do Jack Tober, squeeze it in before Ian Halpern.  We got a very busy show today.  Uh-oh.  Heh, heh, heh.  This guy's a pisser.  It'll sound a little better with some game show music.  You got it?  All right, here we go.  Go ahead, Dan.  Well, Florida Man featured last month as a doll collecting eccentric on hoarders is a registered  sex offender whose rap sheet includes three years in a Michigan prison for an attempted  sex attack on an 18-year-old co-ed and a felony assault conviction for throwing a 72-year-old 
[01:11:00]  woman to the ground following a Fender Bender record show.  That's it, though?  18?  Yeah, let's see.  Convicted in 1981 of an attempted sex attack on an 18-year-old Eastern Michigan University  student.  He was 35 at the time.  He was sentenced to two to five years in prison.  Ended up serving slightly more than three years.  Wow, what a shitty lawyer.  Yeah.  I like the fact that he threw the old bitch down, though, after the fucking traffic incident.  Yes.  That's what you want to do to an old lady when she cuts you off.  Throw her to the ground angrily. 
[01:11:30]  Just a heaver to the ground.  By her shoulders.  You want to just grab her shoulders and throw her to the ground.  Throw her, shake her a couple of times and heave her sideways.  Yeah.  Old douche.  This is on 2002 arrest for pushing a 72-year-old woman to the ground after he got into a minor  auto accident with a senior citizen.  The woman, Joyce Desartes, suffered a broken hip in the fall.  I'm Joyce Desartes.  Of course, the hip breaks.  More brittle than my Pop-Tart.  Mmm. 
[01:12:00]  That Pop-Tart smells delicious.  I did.  And the greatest.  Delicious.  All right.  Hey, Sam, did you bring in some shit from your mom, Bobby, there?  Yes, I did.  Of course you did, because I said that already.  Is it a lot of good stuff?  Yeah, I mean, it would have been more.  She really, uh...  You had to tell her to calm the fuck down?  Yeah, she wanted me to bring in, like, little shoes.  And I said everybody was small.  Like, she just wanted me to bring in clothes.  Like, as if the fact that they were small was something noteworthy.  She wishes you still were small, though. 
[01:12:30]  That I fit into those tiny little Hulk Hogan slippers.  What did you bring in today?  We're going to do it later, but a nice little tease.  I brought in my Weebelos uniform, because obviously...  Can you still fit in it?  No, of course not.  Can you try?  No, I can't fit in it.  Is there still a hole in the back of it?  Because all the patches, of course, from Wolves and Bears are transferred over to the  Weebelos shirt when you get it, with the hat and the belt, so you guys can see my pins  and belt loops.  What uniform can you fit in?  What uniform can I fit in? 
[01:13:00]  And I could wear my old shirt from when I worked at Clearview Cinemas.  You brought that in today, too?  No.  You're assistant to the assistant manager of the movie.  Yeah.  Or when I worked at CM Goody, I could wear that.  Goody got it.  What about one of your Halloween costumes?  You've got to be able to fit in one of those, and I hear you've got all the Halloween costumes.  Well, my mom put together a photo album.  Yeah.  Oh, so you don't have the actual Halloween costumes?  No. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Costumes.  Costumes.  She actually put together a photo album between the time of her phone call and the time I  went to pick it up of all my different wrestler and Dick Tracy Halloween costumes.  Did you bring in the hair?  And, of course, I had the Tupperware full of hair.  It doesn't smell good.  How old is that hair?  That hair...  College, right?  Yeah, it was probably sophomore year of college, so that would be...  Nineteen-ish.  It's not even like baby's first haircut hair, where they put it in a plastic thing, and 
[01:14:00]  it's like, wow, this was your first haircut hair.  It's like you were fucking...  Yeah.  You're college kids.  You were already swapping cum with other guys.  No, I wasn't.  You guys understand...  I'm a swapper.  The hair in the Tupperware container is eight to nine years old.  Stinks.  E-Roc's got to smell that shit today.  I smelled it.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't good.  She's a hoarder where it comes to you.  I know.  She knew exactly where it was.  The Tupperware was waiting right on the kitchen table when I got to the house. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I can't wait to see it.  It's probably there every day that you don't eat dinner with them.  It's probably...  It's on the chair.  It's sitting there.  It's the centerpiece.  Yeah.  But we're going to do all that later, because we've got a busy show.  That's right.  You're here for Jack Tober, then a little Ian Halper, and then we'll get back to you.  His Highness is coming by.  Yeah.  What is he doing today?  Oh, I can't wait for this, and I will be on the scene reporting.  Okay.  He, today, after his show appearance, and this is why this is a big guest for our show, he's  coming here only first, and then he's going straight to his hotel room, where he will be 
[01:15:00]  going through a 48-hour bed-in to raise awareness to amend the Constitution to allow Arnold Schwarzenegger  to run for president.  Arnold who?  The governor.  What did you say?  Schwarzenegger.  You said the name?  Yeah, yeah.  It's Schwarzenegger.  That's what I said.  Schwarzenegger.  In person.  You can't say it that way. 
[01:15:30]  That's how his name is.  Schwarzenegger.  Say his whole name.  Slowly.  Go ahead.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  That's his name.  I can't say it that way.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  I say it real fast now.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I said, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Nah.  Yeah, well.  Not nah.  All right, where's the Jacktober sweeper?  Let's get this horse shit out of the way.  Oh, oh.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Go.  Pull my headphones off.  Goodbye.  It's Jacktober.  Woo!  This is awesome.  A celebration of fantastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  I love you.  Thank you.  So turn up this dirt-tacular radio.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It's Jacktober.  Yeah.  I see we're going to North Carolina today.  North Cackalacky.  Oh.  What the fuck is that?  How do they call it? 
[01:16:30]  North Cackalacky.  North Cackalacky.  That's pretty good.  That's what they say.  In South Carolina, they say, South Cackalacky, raise up.  Raise up.  Take your shirt off.  Right.  Spin it around.  Exactly.  You know.  Like a helicopter.  You know.  Yeah, I know that fucking shit.  South Carolina, raise up.  Anthony, good news.  We're going to be looking at better variety.  Carter and Jackie at WGNI.  What makes them better variety?  It's from the 80s, 90s, and today.  Better variety on WGNI.  How is that better variety? 
[01:17:00]  The variety of song choice.  But what makes it a better variety than all the other stations playing the exact same songs?  Well, they do it with personality.  They're very friendly.  Does regular radio understand that this is just nonsense at this point?  It's drivel.  It means nothing.  There's a million stations calling themselves better variety.  What does it mean?  Well, I mean, it means that of all those stations, this one has better variety, so this is the  one you should be listening to with Carter and Jackie in the morning.  All right. 
[01:17:30]  Well, Carter talks about breaking up over text messages.  Now, I don't know if this is two guys or a guy and a girl.  You don't want me to spoil it, do you?  I guess I haven't heard it.  You can guess.  Jackie is guy's name, Jackie Gleason.  Or Jackie could be girl's name.  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  Well, the second half of the track says Jackie doesn't like that, so I'm assuming that Jackie  has to be a broad.  A bitch.  I'm going broad.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  You guess based on her voice.  But what about when you're trying to...  Was that her contribution already?  This never disappoints.  Women in radio have got to hate us.  I would assume so, guys.  They have to hate us.  But what about when you're trying to dump somebody?  Forget picking them up.  How about trying to get rid of them?  No.  Breakup text message style seems to be the latest rage.  No.  Tacky.  Yeah.  You hear more and more of it happening, especially with 20...  Tacky? 
[01:18:30]  Tacky.  Did she hear her tacky?  No, no, no.  She said no.  Oh, I thought she was saying her name.  No.  She's saying that's tacky.  No.  Good tacky.  You don't want to break up over.  That's what you need from your morning host.  Someone that says tacky.  Is that her right there?  Let's see.  Ooh.  What's up?  Now, that's the best picture she could ever have.  I'm just saying almost.  Almost.  We'll give her an almost.  We'll give her an almost.  Although she has a witch's nose.  Oh, tacky.  Yeah, you hear more and more of it happening, especially with 20-somethings. 
[01:19:00]  You know what, though?  I'm all for it.  Quite frankly, I never stay friends with anyone that I've broken up with, so I don't really,  you know, I'm not going to run into them again.  It seems impersonal and an ugly thing to do, and I'm not saying that it should be done  with, like, seven-year relationships or anything like that, but let's say you went out on,  like, five, six dates.  You know, it's maybe starting to get serious.  You don't know.  Maybe they feel like it is, but you're not feeling it, and you just really want it to  go away.  I'm married, of course, but I don't think that if I were on the date, I was going to add  that in. 
[01:19:30]  Shut up.  Well, you don't want to give anybody the wrong idea.  No, no.  It'll get back to his wife, and God forbid.  I, for one, wasn't in the, of course, category until he said that.  I was thinking something else.  He was sounding a little bit like Kevin Meany.  Oh, hey.  Really?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you like the bed that they're talking over?  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  After looking at them, this show should be called Dahmer and Gums McGillicuddy.  Her fucking gums are atrocious. 
[01:20:00]  Gums McGillicuddy.  She brushed with a paint roller.  Nice gums, stupid.  Her eyes.  She does have the little chiclet teeth.  Her eye teeth are a little rough.  Fucking hard.  They're a little rough.  I wanted to go away.  I'm married, of course, but I don't think that if I were in the dating world, I don't  think I'd be above breaking up via text if it had only been a few dates.  Really?  Yeah, that's what he's saying.  Wow, really?  Really?  What?  Huh?  It's nuts.  That's crazy.  But that's just kind of some of the unpredictability that comes with Carter and Jackie. 
[01:20:30]  Now, are they going to do a texting topic now?  Or are they going into a prep burger bit?  A prep burger song party?  There's so much still to learn with this Jacktober.  I'm confused.  Are they going to go prep burger bit or phone topic?  Well, that's what you have to wonder.  A breakup with a text message breakup.  Wow, you're good.  A breakup with a text message breakup.  You can make so much money from prep burger.  Here's what the formula usually is.  Yeah.  If it's something topical, then you have a prep burger bit to go to. 
[01:21:00]  Right, because they always have topicals.  But if it's something relatable, then we ask the question to the listeners.  Gotcha.  Phone calls.  Phone calls.  Phone calls are radio gold.  Phone calls are radio gold.  Exactly.  Is it cowardly, or is it a sign of the changing times and the technology that's available to us?  I hate his voice.  Especially, and this is a key detail, he just reformatted the topic as a question.  As a question.  Right.  And threw it out there to the listeners.  Because the listeners aren't smart enough on their own to figure out, oh, he just made a statement. 
[01:21:30]  I can comment on that.  He has to rephrase as a question, so then they go, oh, now that he asks that.  And let me put it to you, the listener.  Yes.  You think it's going to be a terrific phone topic?  This one probably got him lit.  Looky, looky, Miss Cookie.  I'm thinking a lot of jokes.  That's a gorgeous thing.  I'm thinking a lot of jokes flying back and forth now.  Crazy stuff.  Crazy stuff.  And stories, stories maybe about guys that have broken up with girls over text.  Phones and vaginas. 
[01:22:00]  It's all sorts of stuff.  Yeah, for sure.  It's Carter and Jackie, man.  Why not?  She would hate my text messages, picture after picture of my cock.  She would hate my text messages.  All photo texts of my dick.  And then just photos of my logs in the toilet.  That's all I would send her.  Are you breaking up with me?  Exactly.  She'd just be responding.  Please stop.  Please stop sending me pictures of your genitals and your feces.  Knock it off. 
[01:22:30]  Times and the technology that's available to us.  I'm going to go ahead and tell you.  It's cowardly.  Handle your business.  Good morning.  This is Kim.  Kim.  Good morning.  How are you?  What do you think Kim is going to say?  How about we play that game?  Hi, this is Kim.  Let me tell you.  What do you think she's going to say?  I don't think there's any honor in breaking up with somebody on a text message.  My Kim.  Shit.  Fuck that.  Ugh.  She sounds disgusting. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, come on.  Good morning.  How are you?  Fine, thank you.  How are you?  Oh, I'm okay.  Just looking for an answer to this silly question.  Is it okay to break up via text message?  What do you think?  Well, I don't know about dating, you know, two, three, four times, but a longer relationship,  I think it's very cowardly.  I was engaged for a year, and he texted me and told me he didn't love me.  Because you're fat.  Because you're fat.  Because you're fat.  Ah, good for her. 
[01:23:30]  Look at her.  I'm Kim.  He probably was like fucking looking around at a bar one night and just went, you know what?  You know what?  Let me text old Kim.  Tell her this is fucking awful.  You know what?  My fiancee weighs 300 pounds, but the one in the bar only weighs 250.  Yeah.  I'm moving on.  Gonzo.  See you later, Kim.  This is a different show.  Cowardly.  I was engaged for a year.  Cowardly. 
[01:24:00]  Very cowardly.  I was engaged for a year.  Oh.  How you engage for a year and he calls it off, you must have been a piece of shit.  He was probably at the jukebox pressing his rod against some drunk girl while she played  beauty school dropout on the jukebox.  Pressing his fucking stupid hillbilly rod on her.  Dumb, hick rod.  He's just rubbing it until he's got goop in his drawers.  His idiotic dick.  He misspelled, text her.  This thing's off. 
[01:24:30]  O-F-E.  Oh, fuck.  I hate this brud.  I think it's very cowardly.  I was engaged for a year and he texted me and told me he didn't love me anymore.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, no.  It doesn't bring close.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yield sign.  Let's slow down a little bit here.  It is sad.  It is sad.  Why wouldn't you play a laugh track right there?  I've been in those circumstances before, but I'm married now. 
[01:25:00]  I'm married.  I just want to let everybody know.  I don't care.  Yuck.  Oh, no.  I broke up with a fat fuck.  I, no.  I, no.  I, she got all fat on him.  I, no.  I, no.  We don't know what she looks like.  Kim?  She's a better fat fuck.  I, no.  I forgot about that. 
[01:25:30]  I, no.  I, no.  Couldn't get the ring back.  I, no.  You're stuck on a thick fucking finger.  I love how they do that.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And the, it, it doesn't bring closure.  Oh.  Oh.  Tragic.  And I think it's very coward.  Did you think about texting back a frowny face?  Oh, I tried.  Oh, my God.  I, I, I gotta leave the studio.  Oh, frowny face.  Hey, hey.  It was a joke.  Just a joke. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, now there's no, you know, two wrongs now.  Yeah.  Two wrongs.  I was just kidding.  I bet he texted her a colon and a zero, which was like the open mouth.  Meaning he was about to have his cock sucked in the bathroom of the bar.  Ah, shit.  A frowny face.  A frowny face.  Oh!  Yes.  Yes, Mel, that's what he said.  He left some voicemails.  He said that.  What's wrong with a little texting humor?  And I think it's very...  Did you think about texting back a frowny face? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, I tried texting back, and he never responded back to me.  Wow.  That sounds like a fun situation to be in.  That's wonderful.  It's over, bitch.  Get your shit.  End of discussion.  Ah.  Oh, you know what?  Matt G makes a great point.  Kim.  Kim.  Um, what are you doing?  Never mind.  I gotta keep that one going.  Shut up. 
[01:27:00]  Moving on.  Bonnie calls up.  Are they still doing the phone topic?  Of course they are.  Yes, texting.  Breaking up texting.  All right.  Original phone topic, because I'm sure there's no other radio show in the country that has  said, hey, have you ever broken up via text?  I've given disease test results via text.  Stop being that. 
[01:27:30]  See a doctor.  Exactly.  Don't buy any XL shirts.  Dash, LOL.  R-O-F-L.  Bonnie calls up.  But good news, guys.  They end with a laugh.  Ooh.  Of course.  Gotta leave them laughing.  Of course.  Good morning, G&I.  Who's this?  Hi, I'm Bonnie.  Bonnie, go ahead with your thoughts, dear.  Um, I think it's cowardly.  If you can ask somebody in person out, you should be able to tell them it's over with  in person.  So what if they asked you out via text? 
[01:28:00]  Huh?  If they asked you out via text, then can the breakup come via text?  Well, that's up to you.  I mean, that's like dating online.  It's a riddle.  No doubt.  Exactly.  Just suck my cock!  What the fuck should that even mean?  And she's like, well, that's like dating on the internet.  Yeah.  I don't know what that is all about.  And then did you hear Carter?  It's a riddle.  It's a riddle.  Yeah.  She dates by life call. 
[01:28:30]  The fucking, hello?  Come over and fuck me.  You should just fucking smile and blow me!  Because I deserve it!  I'd like to put a, I'd like to put one end of a fire extinguisher into her vagina.  And, and, and fill her full of foam until her head blows off.  Call the paramedics.  Tell them to scrape her idiot head off the wall.  You'll notice there's foam and no brain.  She did sound like a blithering fool. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, what a dunce.  Fucking dunderhead.  Ah, shit.  That's not nice.  Hey, see, it's online dating.  That's like an online date.  Well, if you ask someone out, then you should have the courage to break up with them.  What if you texted the other thing?  Well, that's right, that internet dating.  I got my jitterbug.  I used that phone, the jitterbug.  As I roll on my hover round, I could go anywhere.  To Grand Canyon, Statue of Liberty. 
[01:29:30]  How much did you want to see that hover round just fly off the edge of the Grand Canyon?  Have a short circuit and the old bat just flies a mile down.  Just a little puff of dust.  Fuck her.  Fuck her and her old shit.  And as she goes over, her colostomy bag falls onto the ledge.  And then she's continuing to fall on the colostomy bag.  Like, it's just there, so you're waiting for it to get pulled off.  And then you realize her colostomy bag fucking tube is more than a mile long.  But right at the bottom, it gets tugged off and it becomes like a Roadrunner coyote thing with the rock. 
[01:30:00]  Instead of a boulder, it's a giant bag of shit.  At least they have something to bury.  Look at them.  There they are at the Grand Canyon.  What are these things?  Lock in the hubs?  What are they, four-wheel drive?  Don't bullshit these old fucks to make them think they could go to the Grand Canyon in a hover round.  And you know the commercial people put them very close to the edge on purpose.  Look at this.  They've got to be shitting themselves.  Poor fuck.  That's going to go to the Grand Canyon. 
[01:30:30]  That thing can't even get on a sidewalk.  How much would you love with their, uh, the one guy pulling a van?  He's pulling a van with it.  Would you?  Could you pull my van?  I shouldn't be out of gas.  Would you?  How much would you love as they're sitting by the edge of the Grand Canyon to just drive  the van and bumper push them all over the edge?  Like a really...  They put their ineffective brakes on, so the wheels are just scraping.  They're skipping.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  As they near the fucking big giant drop off. 
[01:31:00]  First, the one lady on the right, I'd like to see her hat removed in a vestibule and push  her off the edge.  Oh, they're doing like a Busby, Berklee musical number.  They're dancing with their hover rounds.  Dance with a hover round.  Why not?  And the event's name is Tom Cruise, which is funny.  It should be called a burden mover.  Burden mover.  Yes, I'd like to call for your burden mover.  Oh, come on.  They can't afford one.  Oh, my God.  That's Lillian. 
[01:31:30]  Lillian.  Was that Lillian?  Super Sabre.  Look, they're all fucking.  Play bumper cars with it.  Last one with a broken hip wins.  T-boning each other with those fucking things.  Oh, look at this predator doing the commercial.  He's the inventor.  His name is Tom Cruise.  He's the inventor.  Oh, is it really?  It's spelled with a K, though.  Cruise with a K?  Yeah, yeah.  That's strange.  That's good.  She's right around smelling assholes and bull.  Oh, boy.  That's a trouble.  Oh, come on.  Right in the water.  Holy shit.  They're kind of by the docks.  All waving at each other. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, they're all like waving.  Like they fucking have sports cards.  It's the same guy.  Like, you know, you pass a guy with another Mustang or a vet.  You're like, hey, how you doing?  They're staying at fucking Kindling Legs Inn.  It's the senior citizen's home.  Oh.  Does it come in a free fucking barrel of Febreze for the seat?  That cold fucking shit ass.  That pruning banana shit.  Fucking smell on that chair.  I don't like Grandpa's hover around.  It smells.  You know, the kids are just like, ah, smelling his seat, making bets with each other. 
[01:32:30]  They hate it.  The handles always smell like old person.  Oh, it sucks.  Just let the old people die.  Enough.  Enough already.  The dumb hover around.  Febreze.  Febreze that seat every fucking five minutes.  Oh.  That fat hemorrhoid ass that's sitting 25 hours a day, they're sitting.  It's a portable I had an accident.  It's good.  You can move your fucking human pile of shit from point A to point B if company's coming 
[01:33:00]  over.  This is just so they don't shit on your sofa.  They shit on the hovercraft and then you just stick them in the fucking garage.  Until Thanksgiving dinner's over.  Yeah, you go.  The hover round.  Whatever the fuck it's called.  Sit there and smell the oil stain on the garage floor, you fucking, you inconvenience.  Waste.  Play with the tennis ball above your head.  Just shock his wheels so he can't go anywhere with door stops.  Pull this coffee can full of nails.  Zilch. 
[01:33:30]  Count them while we have fun.  Count these nails and sit your own waist.  So how many nails are in there, smelly?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sax God.  Up around.  Sax God on Twitter.  Did you guys see the video of the guy going through the elevator?  And is that real or fake?  What's that?  You haven't seen it in Japan.  The hand could be used like a knife.  It was a viral video last week.  The guy, the elevator doors close in Japan and the guy's sort of on hover around or something 
[01:34:00]  very similar.  Little Rascal or something like that.  Little Rascal.  And he starts bashing into the elevator door.  I don't know why, if there was a malfunction or he was just a pissed off Japanese guy.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden the doors open and he plummets to his death.  No way.  And it's a Joe Rogan video.  Joe Rogan's pretty damn good with his videos.  He tweets some good stuff.  He tweets some good stuff.  He tweets some good stuff.  I can't believe that.  I'm trying to think.  If someone could give us a link, that would be great.  Yes.  I'd say feedback, please.  What's the camera security?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:34:30]  We'll have to look at this.  Yeah, he didn't give me a link, unfortunately.  We'll get a link.  We'll move back to Jacktober, then we'll get that video for everybody.  Yeah, Jacktober.  I don't know what makes you guys think that that nice lady that called up was in a hover  round.  Ugh.  She just sounded old and awful.  She did.  She sounded like she.  Yeah, we didn't like her.  Bird mover.  Bonnie.  Continuing with Jacktober, North Caroliners.  Better Variety, Carter and Jackie WGNI gets the beating today.  They talk about the world's richest man.  Yes.  A new world's richest man. 
[01:35:00]  Well.  The world has a new richest man.  I thought for sure it was going to be you.  Prepare.  See?  She's got a joke for everything.  Unbelievable.  I know you guys say that a lot of times women in radio are yield signs, but you've got to  admit, at least in this case.  She was pretty amazing.  And it was quick.  It was.  It was quick.  Quick on her feet.  Wouldn't it be great if he had just said, if I was the richest man, I'd hire someone  to cave your head in?  You unfunny fucking.  Oh, now. 
[01:35:30]  Would you?  I'm trying to keep it fun.  Joke stopping lump.  You fucking tumor on the lung of laughs.  That's unfair.  I'd hire someone to shotgun you in the parking lot.  Like fucking, like Eric Bogosian.  I'd hire that fat guy to shoot you.  Oh, shit.  I thought for sure it was going to be you.  Prepare for extreme jealousy.  No, it's not me, of course.  So crazy.  Riding surging prices of his various telecom holdings, Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helu 
[01:36:00]  Slim.  I know.  But he's nothing slim.  I've seen pictures.  He's beaten out Americans Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to become the wealthiest person on  planet Earth.  A Mexican?  And nabbed the top spot on 2010 Forbes list of the world's billionaires.  You know Buffett and Gates are not going to take kindly to that.  Yeah, they need to join forces.  Yeah, they're going to fire back.  Become a hybrid person.  They'll adopt each other.  Why is it insane?  It's insane.  They'll become a hybrid person and adopt each other. 
[01:36:30]  How did she, why was it insane that there's a richest guy and...  I don't know.  I don't, I don't get it.  Those two are like a hybrid person.  They're a munt.  We'll take a break from Jocktober.  Here's the, here's the video.  Tell me if this is real or fake Anthony and Jimmy.  All right, let's look.  Security camera man.  I believe Joe Rogan was the first one to tweak this one.  All right.  So getting in the elevator.  In Japan somewhere.  There's no shit on the face of a bride. 
[01:37:00]  Fake.  Yeah.  All right.  The elevator door is...  Obviously, it's the longer version of the video.  It's not closing.  Is it closed?  This is a week in the life of an elevator.  Elevator door closed.  And the guy just missed getting in.  So he, he's...  He slammed his little rascal as the doors were closing.  Backs up and rams it again.  Oh, now one of the doors kind of came loose at the bottom.  Right.  So it's kind of hanging.  He's going in for another...  I got to fucking call shenanigans on that. 
[01:37:30]  It looked like he went down a ramp.  It didn't even look like he was falling.  The elevator doors definitely look like they were meant to...  Yeah.  They look like a wrestling table.  Yeah.  Who was that guy?  I can't remember his name now.  The guy that fell through the wall.  Oh, yeah.  Eric Nagel.  That's a shock master.  Yeah.  That's a shock master.  Shock master Eric Nagel.  That was a shock master.  That was definitely the same wall.  Let's watch it one more time now that we've seen it and...  What?  Shock master? 
[01:38:00]  No, no.  Just so we can pick out the shenanigans.  I'll tell you one thing that makes me...  Stop right there.  This could just be great.  But in the background, like you see on the right, people walking by, there's background  stuff reflecting and background people walking, which gives it a little bit of validity,  I think.  Oh, does it?  Those Japanese, they're wacky.  I know.  You never know with them.  That is true.  And there does seem to be a glitch in the tape.  Could be a big setup.  I see a glitch.  You see a glitch?  I see a glitch.  I love where?  Watch.  The door shuts. 
[01:38:30]  He hits.  All right.  He backs up.  The elevator goes down in the back.  You see it?  Yeah.  Elevator's going down.  You can see it through.  There's a glitch.  There's a glitch.  What?  There's a glitch.  You didn't see the glitch?  Go back.  There's a little jump.  Get out of here.  Look at it.  Elevator's down.  Now watch.  Watch.  There it is.  There it is.  You see that?  Yeah.  There was a little speed thing right there.  There was a glitch.  His reflection.  Look at his reflection.  It moves slightly.  But maybe someone just edited it, so it's not a long fucking video?  No.  I don't know, man. 
[01:39:00]  Like one of those top doors.  It looks like they're on a hinge.  It looks like shitty sliding closet doors.  It's like...  Oh, there's Japan.  I'm not buying it.  No, it's fake.  I'm calling off.  Shenanigans?  Shenanigans.  All right.  Let's get back to Jacktober, then.  Jack.  Now, if you remember...  Sorry to waste your time with that.  They were talking about the world's richest man.  Oh, right.  Why would they do that?  That is a question.  It's insane.  Now, I already went over why people do things on radio.  And this is now the Jacktober quiz of the day.  Phone topic. 
[01:39:30]  More rich people.  What did I tell you?  Prep burger bit.  So in parody.  Why is it a prep burger bit?  Topical.  Yes.  Topical.  I learned.  Fuck.  I'm learning.  Damn it.  Topical.  Topical.  It's a topical news story, and that means...  They had a lead to their prep burger bit.  We've got to go to bit.  Do they do their own bit, at least?  It might be their voices.  But it's not a good bit.  You've got to give respect to shows that at least do their own bits, but most of them  don't.  But if they're horrible, can you give them respect?  No.  Yeah, at least they're trying.  You give them a little bit. 
[01:40:00]  Are they trying?  It's a little better than fucking signing up for a service and getting your funny from  somewhere else.  Or your attempt to stop.  He's currently pulling in over a billion each month.  That's sort of his monthly salary.  I wonder if he gets a bi-weekly paycheck.  Wow.  Do you think he gets that?  No.  It's only half a billion again.  Good grief, they're taking out like 70 million for my dental this time.  This deserves the Dos Equis treatment.  Let's kick this thing around Dos Equis style.  His limousine driver's limousine driver has his own limousine driver. 
[01:40:30]  When he calls Geek Squad to fix his computer, Bill Gates shows up.  Hello.  He can order an 89-cent beefy five-layer burrito, 61 billion times.  He is Mexico's Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world.  There are 1,011 billionaires on the planet, and he prefers to be the richest.  Stay greedy, me amigos. 
[01:41:00]  It's Carter and Jackie in the morning.  See, what were you saying about respecting?  By the way, she had to be part of the bit.  There isn't a woman's voice in that commercial.  No, it's about the most interesting man.  It's a man's voice, most interesting man, and then he goes, stay thirsty, my friends.  But the narrator, the narrator, is a man.  A man.  But Jackie has to be part of it.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  It's not the Carter show.  Yeah, it's Carter and Jackie.  Oh, God.  You're a dishonest cunt. 
[01:41:30]  God, I miss those.  Oh, I miss those.  I know.  You're a cunt.  Dishonest cunt.  We got Mel listening in for today's Jack-Tover.  He doesn't like Jackie.  No.  She was very dishonest there, because it had nothing to do with the fucking actual commercial, like Anthony  pointed out.  Yeah.  I forgot how wonderful those tapes are.  You look like a fucking bitch on heat, and if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll  be your fault.  Oh, hey.  Jackie, he's just trying to do a show.  Don't put my fucking messages in there. 
[01:42:00]  Come on.  A bitch on heat.  I love when people are mad.  They get the expressions wrong.  You are provocatively dressed all the time with your fake boobs you feel you have to  show off in tight outfits and tight pants and stuff.  You see your pussy from behind.  I don't know if you could see Jackie's.  I know.  Is that one, Nelson?  Nice.  Carter's bath towels smell like...  I don't want to give it away, Anthony.  They're doing a little real-life stuff here. 
[01:42:30]  Carter's bath towels.  Cum, shit, and blood.  I don't want to give it away.  This could get a little edgy for everybody.  Watch out.  Ball bag, sweat, and pampers.  Yeah.  And tears from having to work with that unfunny hole.  They smell salty as towels because he cries into them while he's shitting.  We all have smelly towels at home, but watch out for Carter's.  Watch out.  Watch out.  You ready?  Um, yeah.  Jackie, why do all of my bath towels seem to smell like taco meat? 
[01:43:00]  Taco meat.  Watch out.  That's crazy.  Taco meat.  Taco meat.  Taco meat.  It'd be great if she said, because you're uncircumcised.  And you squeeze your Femunda out like it's aqua fresh into your towel.  Chimp dick.  I don't think she's going to have an answer like that, Jimmy.  I have a feeling her ass is going to fall well short of yours.  Oh, fuck.  Because you're unclipped. 
[01:43:30]  That's right.  Shit.  Shit.  Dick looks like the end of a cannoli.  And he gets nervous and sweats every time she tells a bad joke.  So by the end of it, his cock is just swollen and full of a gangrene leg.  He has to squeeze his fucking Fremunda out with both hands.  He wrings it out.  His smegma.  Like he's choking someone in a cartoon.  That is so fucking disgusting. 
[01:44:00]  I know.  What's wrong with taco meat?  You don't want your towels to smell like it.  Well, they can smell worse than that, though.  Unless it's in the kitchen.  You can do the bit.  Do the bit.  My shirt stinks.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  You got fired.  You suck my cock.  Yes.  Crawl back.  Suck my cock.  And say you're sorry in that order.  That's the best one, man.  It is.  Crawl back.  Suck my cock and say you're sorry in that order. 
[01:44:30]  Like he'd come.  She'd swallow it and then have to say I'm sorry.  That's after crawling and sucking his dick.  And then he comes in her mouth and she goes, I'm sorry.  Then comes the apology.  Right.  Then he's like, all right.  People have requested Maxwell for Jocktober and they don't realize that we can't do him.  Did he ever get rehired to her?  Not that I know of.  Oh, he was supposed to be a big star.  What happened to him?  He got fired.  What about the other guy that shot his?  Oh, he's back on the radio.  Shannon Burke?  Yeah.  Shannon Burke's back on the radio. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Well, AM.  One station.  I got to back any guy that handles a situation like that.  He shot his chest dog.  I got to support any guy who fucking, who takes care of business like that.  Accidental discharge.  Jackie, why do all of my bath towels seem to smell like taco meat?  Ew.  What is wrong with you?  That's disgusting.  We are having the most disgusting morning of radio.  Well, maybe I should do that.  No, not the most disgusting morning of radio.  Jimmy talking and describing why the towels smell like that. 
[01:45:30]  A little more disgusting than your version.  I do believe we're still numero uno in that category.  And I want to know why her fucking towels smell like Grecian formula and chicken wing sauce,  hot wing sauce, watermelon rinds.  What kind of pipe is she going to take?  Unemployment.  Why?  Because it smells like unemployment.  What does that smell like?  I don't know what it smells like.  I don't either.  The rent's too damn high.  Too damn.  Damn high. 
[01:46:00]  Radio.  Well, maybe I should back it up just a little bit.  I do all the laundry at my house.  I'm just that guy.  And I know that it gets done properly.  However, I have to start wondering about the laundry detergent and the fabric softener  and all that stuff that I'm using.  Do towels still smell?  Well, it's not that they smell when they come out of the wash, but I like to try to recycle  them.  I like to get one or two uses, so I'm not doing a family of five.  I don't think that's abnormal.  I'm pretty sure everyone uses a towel more than once.  But the second time I take a shower and I pull that thing in there to dry up, it's 
[01:46:30]  like, what is the deal?  I mean, it just smells like mildew and taco meat.  You need taco meat?  You stink.  What is wrong with you?  Yeah, he apparently has B.O. or something.  He does the laundry because his wife's an invalid and she lays down on her side and puts flowers  in her mouth so she doesn't embarrass the family when people come over.  It's like a big vase.  Oh, okay.  Bobby, I haven't had any experience with smelly towels, especially after just two uses or 
[01:47:00]  something like that.  Sam, anyone?  How often do you...  I'd like to just elaborate on this topic a little bit.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  How often do you do your laundry?  I don't do my laundry.  What?  I have people that do it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Me too.  Mom.  Bobby in the house!  Can I tell you, after we fuck, so many times we use the towel to wipe the cum off her 
[01:47:30]  back and ass, and I throw it on the floor.  Off her back and ass.  Yeah.  And how many times the fucking housekeeper comes and has to find that fucking solid towel.  The cum towel.  Yeah.  You gotta try to put her back and ass.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's where I would fucking arc.  You're not like a nice guy that goes to the bathroom to clean up a little bit and then  comes back with a warm washcloth and wipes the back and ass or anything like that?  A warm washcloth? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're running under warm water and stuff.  You gotta wash.  She's literally, if I had my way, I would wipe my dick with a sock, turn it inside out  and go, here, bitch.  Anthony's a gentleman.  He uses a warm washcloth.  I try to be a gentleman when wiping my jism off of a girl.  For you, it's a DNA cleanup.  You have to.  You don't use alcohol and scrub.  I use bleach.  Yeah, you don't use bleach and fucking boiling water.  You don't wash her in lye?  No, I don't.  No, that's your thing. 
[01:48:30]  This is a different towel break.  We're not talking, this is not the towel break that we're using.  This is disgusting.  We're trying the most disgusting break ever.  But my towels don't smell like taco meat.  I wonder, I mean.  Or cum.  Do you get cumzies on your towels?  No.  You ever use them?  What do you and the girl use to clean up with?  Paper towel.  Oh, like bounty?  Instead of tissues.  Tissues?  She makes them cum into a brawny.  That's what they do for sex.  He just smells her feet and jerks off into a brawny towel.  And then his mom saves them all in the cupboard. 
[01:49:00]  That's not true.  Bobby has a cum cupboard.  This is one of Sammy's flu cums.  Mike, you notice the yellow discharge in it.  Can we call Bobby today to see if she's doing that?  Well, I mean, yeah, sure.  But, I mean, that's a very disrespectful question to ask.  She's obviously not doing that.  Let's finish up Jack Tolber.  Saves in a cum cupboard.  One more track, Carter and Jackie do a freaking, you wrote that, Sam.  Yes, I did. 
[01:49:30]  A freaking crazy stunt.  Yeah, it's like, I'm listening to the show, and while it's happening, I go, this isn't  going to happen.  This is freaking crazy.  Now, wait a minute.  Quickly.  This is from the same show, right?  It's all from one show?  Yes.  We got captivating conversation.  Correct.  We had a phone topic.  Phone topic.  We had a produced bit.  Boom.  And now we're going to go with a stunt.  A freaking crazy stunt.  This is... 
[01:50:00]  A perfect show.  A perfect show, right.  It's the greatest show ever.  A perfect show.  This is a perfect show.  Wow.  Perfect.  Wow.  Well, it's almost perfect.  It's not quite the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah.  Literally.  Towels.  Now, I believe in replacing my towels once they become frayed and old and stuff, but if  I'm washing them regularly, why would they...  It's like a chair.  The butt of...  The bottom of a chair, your butt is constantly on it.  So it's going to...  I've never sniffed the seat of my chair if that's what you're getting at.  Sniff your chair.  Sniff your chair.  Sniff your chair.  You smell, idiot.  It's everyone else's.  That's the beauty of chair sniffing.  I have to teach this kind of smell chairs. 
[01:50:30]  Why would you smell your own chair?  That's my dream, is to live next door to a fucking...  An ex-model in a wheelchair so I can smell her chair all the time.  Sniff my chair if that's what you're getting at.  Sniff your chair.  Okay, hold on.  I'll do it right now.  Whoa!  Keep talking so that no one's bored.  I will.  Yeah, you smell the seat of your chair.  Keep talking so that no one's bored?  Oh, hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You made an error there.  Radio guys don't understand that sometimes you gotta just fucking hang out, man. 
[01:51:00]  You don't have to fill up the airwaves of words all the time.  Keep talking.  But this talk has been so exciting.  They're worried that somebody's going to get bored if any of the talking stops.  Oh, hold on.  Wait a minute.  This isn't just my chair.  This is not just my chair.  Yeah, you've got two other people that sit in that chair every day.  And you just put your face on it.  I should not have done that.  I know.  I was going to remind you not to do that, but you hopped off the chair.  Yeah, so like it's...  Thanks.  When they get going...  That was a stunt.  Watch out.  That was like...  Watch out.  But he never smelt it. 
[01:51:30]  No, but his face was near it.  And did you hear the part?  Yeah.  There are two other people that sit in that chair.  Two other people sit in that chair.  It's not just him.  No.  I'll tell you, I'll burn the goddamn house down.  But pull out of me first.  Mel, don't burn anything down.  He gets very uptight when he listens to these morning shows.  I know.  I don't know why he's so stressed.  This is supposed to be an easy...  He's a fucking bat on the side of the head.  Now he's talking to you, Sam.  All right, sorry, Mel.  I'm sorry.  Watch out.  I'm sorry.  This is just some of the fun of Jocktober. 
[01:52:00]  Are we done?  Yeah.  If you want, I mean, we could keep...  Yeah.  You guys seem like you're upset again.  It's just shit every fucking day with this Jocktober.  Suck-ass radio with dumb holes and castrated men.  I was hoping this show would get a golden ticket.  Yeah.  Yeah, that worked out well.  What did we give out, one?  One to run it fast.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we...  See, we're just...  Go home? 
[01:52:30]  We're just down.  Now you don't want to do a show anymore.  Well, look at the good news right there.  His Highness.  Call him His Highness.  His Highness is here.  Ian Halperin.  Yes.  Ian Halperin.  His Highness Hollywood himself, who will be doing a bed-in today and will be changing  the world when he gets the Constitution amended, as only Canadian-born Ian Halperin can do.  Yeah, how does that work?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  But why, Sam?  Huh?  You forgot to mention the book.  The Governator?  Where, finally, the world gets to know about Arnold Schwarzenegger, and let me tell you 
[01:53:00]  something about this quote.  I always said that.  What?  You just pronounce his last name a little differently than most people.  Try to pronounce it slowly.  Maybe that's the problem.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Well, it got a little closer that time.  A little bit, a little bit.  Yeah, but the first time he just said it.  But he said that he can't get booked on other shows.  Why?  Why?  Because Arnold Schwarzenegger's people are so worried. 
[01:53:30]  Are they worried?  Are they doing that on purpose?  About this book coming out.  No.  That's how his name is passed.  They're worried about this book coming out?  Is it a tell-all?  Yes, because...  Do tell.  It highlights Arnold Schwarzenegger's womanizing ways.  Oh, wow.  This is groundbreaking.  We've never heard the fact that Arnold groped women and had sex with women.  I've heard that Arnold makes Tiger, Schwarzenegger, makes Tiger Woods look like the Virgin Mary. 
[01:54:00]  Any comments, anybody?  No.  Hey, Scorch, I didn't know you.  He just wants to be part of the show today.  What happened?  That's the best one.  Hey, there he is.  What do you do for a living character?  Is that Arnold Schwarzenegger?  That's not Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Somebody photoshopped a picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he really does look like an African gentleman.  He's not African.  No.  He's Austrian.  Not with a last name like what?  Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Not with that last name.  There's an E in there.  All right.  Queens.  Yeah, we know.  After the end.  Can we go to break so we get Ian in here?  And then after Ian, Sam is doing a little show and tell today.  I guess so.  His mommy, Bobby, there, put a bunch of things together for us to check out.  Oh, you want to show me everything, but you're not telling me nothing.  Oh!  Show and tell.  Shit, his hair.  That's pretty good. 
[01:55:00]  That's a great impression.  That's really good.  Yeah, you know.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Dude, I'm bitch.  Can I go to a break with a jingle over here?  I go jingle today.  The Obi and Anthony Show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:55:30]  This one's for you, Ian.  Canada's own rush for Ian Halpern.  Woo!  And Jimmy and Anthony have left the studio in protest, sir.  In protest, they left the studio.  They don't want to be part of this interview.  Oh, they're back.  We're playing rush for Ian Halpern.  Neil Peart, the greatest drummer.  Yes.  Let's slow down a little bit with that.  They're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Isn't that silly? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, it's disgusting.  Terrible.  Oh, they're Canadian.  That one is ridiculous.  The rush thing is just completely ridiculous at this point, that they're not in the Hall of Fame.  Creative guys, very original sounding.  Know how to play their instruments.  Right, Ian?  Unlike yourself.  You know, Neil Peart, he lost his wife, his daughter in like the same year.  Yeah.  Completely changed his life, wrote a book about it.  Well, he drove around America on a motorcycle, right?  That's right.  That's right.  And then he had some cancer, too.  Yeah, he's been through it all, and he's still standing. 
[01:56:30]  I thought that was a rumor.  The cancer part?  Nah, man.  I think he had...  Well, not always a rumor that he had cancer or something.  Maybe it was bed acne.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't see the cancer or bed acne.  I don't know.  Ian, where's your horn?  You promised us the next time you come to New York.  I know you got a busy day, but you said you would bring the horn.  The horn's in the zipper today, and you don't want to see that because it got a big workout last night.  Ah, the horn.  No, really.  My buddy Flees is here today.  When you walked into my hotel, was his highness single?  No, he's with my hotel. 
[01:57:00]  How about you talking to him, Mike Flees?  No, really.  He walked into my hotel 10 to 7, and I am with a Wall Street chick who was just smoking hot.  I met her in Miami.  You know, I roll into town.  Everyone looks miserable in this fucking town except me, man.  I'm the only guy smiling this morning.  Let me tell you something.  Schwartzy is trying to stop my book.  Why?  It's not going to happen, and I'm putting out...  I'm pleading with O&A listeners.  Uh-oh.  I call it O&A and J, by the way, because I love this guy over here. 
[01:57:30]  Of course.  I call it J and O&A, but...  And I have bought the copyright to that name, so technically I'm the owner of the O&J show.  But they're trying to stop my book, and they think I'm just going to take it.  Look, I've made my money.  His Highness, when he comes out with a book, you know, I'm getting O&A and J type money here.  I could just chill out on a beach now, have four fucking chicks sucking my cock all day, 
[01:58:00]  and they could lose.  Harper Collins, they don't know how to sell a book, so they could lose all their money.  They don't care.  Rupert Murdoch has deep pockets, but it's my reputation.  When His Highness steps up to the plate, I like to hit it out of the park.  I don't have to be here today in New York fucking city trying to make money back on my book.  I've been paid on this motherfucking thing, and it's the best book.  If anyone finds one fucking error in this book, I will climb the highest mountain in Austria naked  and jump to my death.  Wow.  I'm telling you that right now.  God, I hope there's an error. 
[01:58:30]  Now, Schwartzy is trying to stop my motherfucking book.  Now, why is he trying to stop it?  Do you like the cover, Anthony?  The cover is The Governator.  Your name is very, very prominent at the bottom.  I'm bigger than the title.  Yeah, yeah.  What's that about, Ian?  Your name is prominently displayed on the front and the back cover.  And the back is the other half of his face.  Now, why would he try to stop this book?  What is in here?  Some highlights.  You don't have to give a book away.  You know, I want people to buy it.  But a few little highlights, a few little teasers. 
[01:59:00]  What's in there that he is so upset about?  Well, it's all about the politics, and it's all about him having gay sugar daddies.  I say that in the book.  What?  Like, fuck the sex.  Finding Schwartzy, a woman to talk about Schwartzy getting his dick sucked and all that.  Easy, right?  It's like finding snow in Montreal in winter.  Piece of cake, right, right.  But I talk about the gay sugar daddies.  That's what's gotten me nervous.  Now, what is this gay sugar daddy business?  I haven't heard of this now.  This is captivating, intriguing.  And it's about the politics, too.  About his real politics. 
[01:59:30]  When Schwartzy was coming up, and first of all, I've got to say, this book was a bit hard on me.  Because my dad is a Holocaust survivor, and I trek to Austria undercover here.  And my dad hid in a cave for seven years.  This is no joke, Anthony.  My great-grandfather died in a concentration camp, too.  All right.  So, see, we have two things in common now.  Jill Nicolini and our family being wiped out.  Fucking joke.  I used the old joke.  He didn't even hear the old joke.  I heard the old joke.  Yes, he did, of course.  You've got to love that one. 
[02:00:00]  So, I'm just trying to cover up for him today.  What happened in Austria?  I got laid.  I got laid.  You know, the Jew fucked a lot of Austrians.  And, you know, I gave one back for the survivors.  Trying to get it back, right, right.  And, you know.  Give it back to the community.  But, Schwartz, he has a lot of Nazis in his family.  Uh-huh.  And it wasn't pleasant.  I'm watching Spitzer on the screen now, man.  This guy's a dud.  Like, what the fuck is going on?  That's not Spitzer.  No, he was just, yeah, he's up on your screen there.  He is a dud, though.  His TV show. 
[02:00:30]  This is the worst show.  I told you guys.  All right, well, you're talking.  O&A should be 8 o'clock on CNN, followed by His Highness, King is Dead, and then we'll  let Cooper, you know, the Poofter Cooper do his thing.  Any books coming out on Anderson Cooper?  You thinking about that?  Well, here's the challenge for O&A listeners.  Okay.  Right now, the book is tanking.  My first book, I've written 15 books.  This one, it comes out, you know, I'm used to going on today's show.  I always flirt with Meredith.  She likes me, Meredith. 
[02:01:00]  Uh-huh.  I'm used to going on Anderson, every motherfucking show.  Here's my first interview, and this is the way it's going to go, and I'm honored.  Oh, shit.  First off, I thank you guys for having the balls.  The only reason you're talking to us is because everyone else said no to you.  No, I always talk to you guys anyhow.  I know, after you talk to everybody else.  I would rather do this show than Diane Sawyer, than Matt Lauer, because all those  people, I think they're wax figures at Madame Tussauds anyhow.  They're stiffs.  Now, do you think they're scared to, uh...  They're scared because it's not only Schwartzy, it's Maria's camp. 
[02:01:30]  Uh-huh.  It's found all the media.  Don't have them on.  We don't want the kids knowing about the gay sugar daddies.  We have four children here.  Gay sugar daddies.  I've never heard this allegation.  You should have that in the jacket here.  That should be the title of your book.  Well, if it would have been in the jacket, they tried to shut down the book.  See, you don't realize, His Highness has done exposés on the Church of  Scientology.  Of course.  On Kurt Cobain, on Jackson.  No one stops His Highness.  Right.  And they thought they'd stop the book, and the book is out in stores, at least. 
[02:02:00]  I got that hurl.  Now, here's the...  But it's not doing well, sir.  You know, the book's...  Because you've got to be able to promote it.  Right now, the book is tanking, but here's what I'm asking ONA listeners.  Okay, okay.  Go to Amazon.  If ONA could take this to the top ten on Amazon within the next 48 hours, I will come  on this show, and any motherfucking subject that the listeners want me to do next.  If they want an expose on Howard Stern, who's a good friend of mine, I'll do it.  You guys get to choose the next expose. 
[02:02:30]  Jose, but I want ONA to get behind this book.  Just buy the motherfucking thing on Amazon.  Let's not let Schwartzy stop it.  You don't have to read it.  This right now is the Nazi against the Jew.  Did your good friend Howard book you for this book?  No, Howard won't have me on.  That's weird.  And Howard usually has me on 90 minutes at a shot.  Let me ask you.  I'm the only guy to ever dance with Howard.  They're ignoring me.  I mean, something is happening here.  And I respect Howard, but, you know, Jews of a feather. 
[02:03:00]  Isn't it possible that this book isn't doing well?  Because, look, everyone, first of all, you probably do.  You've had hit after hit.  Everyone has one fucking bad one, but it could be the timing, too.  This is my best book.  I'm not going to let it down.  No, I mean one bad sales book.  But isn't it possible that because he's leaving office or he's almost done, people are losing  interest?  Almost like when Will Ferrell did the Bush thing after Bush was out already.  It was harder to get behind it because the time of it was a little bit more.  So you're right, Norton.  But I'll tell you one thing.  Here's the hook on this book.  You're right, Norton. 
[02:03:30]  His next move, and I say this clearly, this is what the book's about.  He intends to run.  He intends to get the Constitution amended.  Whatever Schwartz he touches, it works.  I mean, the guy, I've never seen an actor with more scathing reviews in Hollywood when  he started his career.  He knows how to get to the finish line.  And he wants to amend the Constitution, make a run for president in 2016 with Bloomberg  as vice.  He's calling it the dream team, the financial dream team.  And today I'm starting a bed-in in New York City. 
[02:04:00]  I'm inviting every hooker in New York to come to the Warwick Hotel.  I'm going to be in bed in the rock.  And I'm doing a 48-hour fast.  Why only 48 hours?  Well, you know, I don't want to start looking like I'm in a concentration camp and then  come on this show.  Could you just take an E-rock with you?  Your books rank pretty good, though, Ian.  Where are we today?  Well, let me see.  Where are we?  97,000. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, wow.  Well, we started at 500,000 48 hours ago.  Okay, you're moving up a little bit.  Well, now we have to get in the top 10.  We've got to get in the top 10.  Okay, that'll happen.  I will write the next book about any subject this audience wants me to.  This is my only shot.  I really need your guys' support right now.  Well, you're not really selling the book, though.  The gay sugar daddies.  What else is in this book?  Maria Shriver, virgin, when they got married.  Oh, really?  What?  He dated her for eight years. 
[02:05:00]  You know, this is a staunch Catholic.  She wanted to go down pure, 100% pure.  How would you find something like that out?  And this is a...  What you're asking me, dude, you're the guy who questioned me about Reggie fucking Bush.  You grilled my baits on this show.  I told you you'll lose the fucking eyes, man.  I told you there's a fucking Tiger Woods tape out there.  You guys...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Tiger Woods tape is fake.  It's not fake.  It's not fake.  Oh, man.  There's a tape. 
[02:05:30]  Controversy.  There's a tape out there.  But the actor...  Well, they call him an actor.  I'm telling you...  A Philadelphia boxer.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about that tape.  There's another tape.  To this day, I'm telling you, there's a sex tape that will come out.  Did Reggie Bush...  I mean, does he still have the Heisman on his mantle?  I think he started the Tiger Woods tape.  No, he does not.  He gave it back.  Tiger Woods and Reggie banging the Kardashian sisters.  There it is.  There it is.  The sex tape is a fake, so...  I'm not talking about this sex tape.  But now you're going on record again and saying there is an actual sex tape out there. 
[02:06:00]  There is a tape out there.  All right.  But I maintain that.  It says the Tiger Woods sex tape is a fake.  It should say this Tiger Woods sex tape is a fake.  Absolutely.  Because they're ignoring my plea.  Uh-huh.  But eventually it will come out.  It took a long time for the Reggie Bush shit to come out.  Yeah, sure.  Sure.  He doesn't have that in his trophy case anymore.  But let's get back to Schwartzy.  Yes.  Has he ever been on the show?  Yes.  Yeah, many times.  All right.  And what's your impression? 
[02:06:30]  We like him.  He's a good guy.  It's very fair, this book.  I'm endorsing the guy to become president.  I like his relatives from the homeland.  Oh, yeah?  You like them?  They wiped out my people.  I didn't say that.  I meant his other relatives.  Oh, the Kennedys?  Yes, of course.  I'm, you know...  We can talk about the Nazis.  I interviewed some Kennedys.  How deep into the Nazi party were the Schwarzeneggers?  It was Gustav.  He was a member, a big admirer of Adolf.  Yeah.  Indirectly responsible for the extermination of about 10,000, 12,000 Jews. 
[02:07:00]  Now, how would he indirectly be responsible for that?  Because he gave...  He was pretty high up and he gave the orders.  Oh, he was...  Was he in the SS?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, okay.  So some of Governor Schwarzenegger's relatives...  And Governor Schwarzy, I mean, seriously, I love Schwarzy.  But, you know, photos of him giving the Hitler salutes, using the N-word.  Now he becomes governor.  Let's get David Duke in there, too.  No, he's sympathetic to the Jews. 
[02:07:30]  He's not a Nazi.  Schwarzenegger's not a Nazi.  No way.  Can I ask you about the bed-in?  Yes.  Is the media going to show up, or are you going to be just in a closed hotel room?  Well, whatever happens, I'm going to be, you know, getting my rocks off, because I'm  having the top, you know...  Will you allow our people...  All hookers, everyone's invited.  This is...  Will you allow our people in there, sir?  Absolutely.  All right.  Well...  This is like John and Yoko.  We'll send our cameras in there.  I'm in Montreal.  My hometown is 69.  Hopefully it's like John in front of the Dakota.  You never know.  But His Highness is bulletproof. 
[02:08:00]  Yes, of course.  I could take more than John.  Your Highness, if you kill yourself, the book will be number one, because of the fascination  of your last project.  Well, you know, hey...  Do you want to take your life today, sir?  Look...  Wow, Arnold's got a big piece.  I'll go head-to-head, toe-to-toe with Arnold.  Did you study the big piece that Arnold has?  And that's probably with steroids, sir.  Yeah.  Well, His Highness ain't on steroids, and I make him look like, you know, the dwarfs.  There's no comparison here.  But, look, Schwartzy...  I mean, this guy got pussy more than anyone in Hollywood. 
[02:08:30]  But what about the gay sugar daddies?  Well, the gay sugar daddies financed Arnold in the early part of his career.  What did they get in return?  Uh, that we don't know.  Cuck!  I don't say...  Cuck!  But numerous...  One was a billionaire.  Google it.  He was obsessed.  Yeah, Google that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a billionaire, and he was obsessed with the body of Schwarzenegger, and Arnold used  him, they were inseparable, because the bodybuilders needed money to go on tour, to... 
[02:09:00]  You know, they make 200 bucks a week, these guys.  I have a lot of photos in there.  Any photos of the sugar daddies?  No, but I went undercover in the Republican Party.  Really?  I infiltrated the...  Here.  Can I see the pictures?  Don't you just have to register?  Well, no.  I went to the party.  Oh, okay.  You know, he's not a Republican.  No, no.  My favorite line from Schwarzenegger in this book is, he says he loves George Sr. and Barbara, 
[02:09:30]  but Jr. he despises, and he has no idea how George and Barbara gave birth to such an  idiot, quote-unquote.  Such an idiot.  Really?  Well, that's good.  Everybody does it.  Yeah, but this was in...  I'm the governor.  See?  Pretty good, right?  See?  Everyone does it.  I do good impressions.  Everyone does it.  I'm going to be back.  I do good impressions.  Isn't that good, Ian?  Good stuff, right?  Hey, what's your friend about over there? 
[02:10:00]  Fleas?  He used to work for Eddie Murphy.  He has some wild stories.  Oh, yeah?  What did you do for Eddie Murphy?  When Eddie tried to have his music career.  Oh.  Which failed.  Yeah, come on.  It's failed.  You might say failed.  He had a hit.  Party all the time.  Come on.  After he had party all the time, he wanted to be a big rock star after that.  He put his big company together and tried to be a real rock star and a real musician.  Didn't work.  What was the second album called?  Did he do all and just did one?  No, he did the second album.  What was it called?  I don't even remember.  It's called A Piece of Shit.  Piece of Shit.  They just knew. 
[02:10:30]  What about the tranny, sir?  I don't know.  No, I used to go bowling every Wednesday night.  And there used to be beautiful women.  Every Wednesday, they had a different hot chick.  They'd get behind somehow to bowl like that.  Fascinating.  He was a woman, sir.  And he had a very short temper.  All right, so Eddie Murphy sang and bowled.  Yeah.  And fucked.  With beautiful women.  And fucked.  And fucked.  Where are you from, sir?  Montreal.  Montreal.  Originally.  Okay.  You got a little more of an accent.  He has some good Joe Jackson stories.  Joe Jackson?  You sure?  Because the Eddie Murphy ones were just terrific.  How do you top those? 
[02:11:00]  Joe Jackson played badminton, but I don't want to get into details.  What does he got in Joe Jackson?  I'll go with this one again.  What do you got in Joe Jackson?  Joe Jackson, he fucked us once.  It's because we were doing this album with Eddie Murphy, and the album was about to come  out, and like a week before, we get a phone call from Joe Jackson, and he says, we need  a little side deal cut, otherwise everything falls apart.  And we had to give Joe Jackson a side cut apart from his son's thing.  What?  He was a Sherlock, you know, and he screwed his son. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  And you saw that based on his book and whatever.  Yes.  You know what I heard, too?  I heard Elton John plays Zim Zam.  Hey, your highness, you got any predictions?  Anything going on out there in the celebrity world?  What do you got?  What do you got?  What are you working on?  I'm just predicting this book will get a bit better than 97,000 on Amazon.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you came to the right place.  You know, I need everyone's support.  I'm not kidding.  The next book...  Could this be your last book if this doesn't do well? 
[02:12:00]  No, because they all want me.  I mean, I get publishers calling me every week to do something, but I'm very picky, but  I want to just let the people speak on the next book.  And again, if they could take this into the top ten on Amazon, the next book is the O&A  and J audience's choice.  Because I'm not going to...  Look, I could sit down and play dead here again and have four chicks sucking my cock all  day with the money they paid me.  But you know what?  Why?  Why?  Right?  Yeah.  I'd rather be looking at you guys this morning, right? 
[02:12:30]  Because it's boring.  We got Seth in Boston.  He wants to back you up, sir.  We're going to sell books right now.  Go ahead, Seth.  As much as Ian drives me bananas, I have to back him up on one thing about his Arnold  claim.  A guy that used to own a gym that I went to, he went IFBB Pro back in the early 80s.  And one of the reasons he dropped out was he was told when he went to California that  a lot of the gays controlled the major steroid market.  And they controlled a lot of the best stuff. 
[02:13:00]  So a lot of guys would be asked to do posing, private poses.  Some guys would actually be asked to do other things.  Really?  If you wanted some of the best stuff on the market, you had to play to pay.  And let me tell you something.  In the book, I say Arnold, he not only took the steroids, he also dealt the steroids.  He was a shrewd business person from the get-go.  No wonder they're trying to stop this book.  The gays controlled the steroids.  Who knew that?  Who knew the gays controlled the steroids?  I used to talk to me when he told me. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Thank you for your call.  Yeah.  Schwarzenegger posed nude for homoerotic photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.  Is that true?  Yeah.  And at least three times in the 70s, and he appeared naked in a 22-photo spread in the  now-defunct gay rag after dark.  Look at Schwartzy today.  This is a recent photo of him.  Would you like to see him naked in this condition?  He's not that bad.  He's a little heavier, but he's an old gentleman.  How old is the gentleman these days?  Looks like a prune.  He's 63. 
[02:14:00]  63.  He looks good for 63, sir.  I say he's going to make a run in 216 for Prez after His Highness helps him get the Constitution  amended, because I find the Constitution discriminatory.  It's the only thing.  You come over here, you work your whole life, you can do anything, but you can't run for  Prez because it's against the foreign-born here.  That's the whole deal.  That's the whole deal, Wade.  Wade?  That's my deal?  No, it's one of those, like, you know, it's the Constitution.  It says, you know, you don't want any, I guess they didn't want any outside influence 
[02:14:30]  coming in and getting the presidency, getting that much power.  Right.  That's right.  But we're going to change that.  Why?  We don't want it changed.  Has Obama changed that?  Oh, please.  Him and that birth certificate story.  What's your take, Anthony?  Was he born here?  I would love to say no, but I think he was born in Hawaii.  I've seen a lot of things that kind of point in that direction.  I've seen no proof that he was born in Indonesia. 
[02:15:00]  So if Schwartzy gets it amended, if he runs in 216, he will be 69, the same age his hero,  Ronald Reagan, became Prez.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I don't think.  Whoa.  Ah, Zolly North.  Wow.  That's good, Ian.  You've got to admit.  Let me ask, are there any chicks out there who want to go to bed with His Highness the  next couple of days, be on TV?  Call in.  I'll have you at the hotel.  All right, let me say, John in Philly, not a chick, but he's got something for you, Ian. 
[02:15:30]  John.  Hello, Your Highness.  Hey, John, how you doing this morning?  Not bad, but I have a question.  Yeah, first of all, how's Philly?  What's going on over there?  How's the hoes on Broad Street?  When was the last time you got laid?  A few days ago.  A few days ago.  What was her name?  Huh?  What was her name?  I'm not going to give out.  Don't worry, she's not listening, man.  I won't tell anyone.  Well, you're going to write a book about me next time.  Did she lick your crack?  So, what about that mystery virus, Your Highness? 
[02:16:00]  Wiping out Hollywood the last time you were on?  Well, actually, that mystery virus became true.  The Indian flu, they called it, now spread all over the place.  I thought it was the whooping cough.  The whooping cough.  Well, it was something like that, but it turned out to be the Indian flu.  That's what we have to worry about this year?  Yeah, absolutely.  And it's spreading like wildfire.  Did you catch it, Philly?  But it's not wiping people out.  It's just making them miss a few days of work.  No, it's killing people.  Some people have died over this, and it's spreading. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah?  And that's what's coming to America next.  That's good news.  You have a good memory, Philly.  Next time I come to Philly, I'm going to bang all your girlfriends.  Ah, shit.  And then you'll get His Highness' leftovers.  You want some of His Highness' leftovers?  We've got a big fan on the line, Ian.  Vinny from Brooklyn.  Vinny?  I love the name Vinny.  How you doing, Vinny?  You remember me?  Vinny, what's going on?  How are you?  Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.  What happened?  Mark the label, Vinny. 
[02:17:00]  How you doing, ONA?  Listen.  Yeah.  Your book, what's the deal with you?  You're always on the show.  You always talk out of your ass.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Now it's the Indian flu.  How dare you?  How dare you, sir?  Vinny.  Yeah.  Talk to me.  Listen, I feel bad for you.  I don't want to insult someone with AIDS, but, you know.  You said you have AIDS, dude.  You said you have AIDS.  Come on, Brooklyn. 
[02:17:30]  Represent.  He just said you have AIDS.  But if I see you outside the studio, Vinny, I'm going to bop you.  Aw, shit.  How are you going to bop me?  What are you going to bop me?  Because, seriously, I challenged Schwarzenegger to go toe-to-toe with me.  I said I'd rent out Madison Square Garden.  Let's settle this.  Mano, mano.  I put him in a clutch and fuck him in the ass.  You know why you didn't get to Madison Square Garden?  Well, rent too damn hot.  Too damn hot.  Too damn hot. 
[02:18:00]  Vinny, stop banging chicks.  At least have an AIDS card on you and, you know, disclose.  I won't tell anyone, Vinny.  I won't tell anyone, Vinny.  I'll disclose, Jerry.  I won't tell anyone.  You and he have to give you a win.  Is there a such thing?  I don't know if you have an AIDS card.  Don't leave home without it.  Don't leave homo without it.  Vinny, are you coming to the bed in?  You're going to watch his highness bang New York's finest hoes?  You?  You're uglier than sitting.  How the hell are you going to bang all the horses?  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy. 
[02:18:30]  Vinny, I'm not even going to respond to that.  A couple of months ago, Anthony was talking about the Holocaust and everything.  As I said to you last time, you should have been burnt in the fucking Holocaust.  Oh, now, sir.  I was.  You were?  Absolutely.  My whole family was burnt there.  That's the same as burning his highness.  It's like if Sirius wouldn't have renewed this contract for this show, I take it personally.  I would have done something.  I would have done another protest because I love this show.  Thank you, sir.  Absolutely. 
[02:19:00]  And on the next contract, I'm going to negotiate directly with Mel because obviously you guys  didn't have the right people.  This went down to the 12th hour here.  12th.  No talking about it now.  Now, the guys with the two hottest chicks in this room is obviously Jim and myself because  I've met Jim's girlfriend, man, and wow.  I mean, she is smoking.  Hope's got quite a lady.  You better say that with all due respect, sir.  Well, look, with all due respect to Anthony.  I just mean with all due respect to Jimmy. 
[02:19:30]  His girl is lovely.  Yes.  But she's also a very funny, nice person.  Absolutely.  Oh, and you can compliment her however you want.  That tall vagina that Jim walks around with apparently has a head and feet.  I didn't notice.  I don't mind.  That night I met Jim, he took me backstage, and he stole the show.  This was in Montreal.  Thank you.  The place went nuts.  The other ones were good, but it's like, you know, when A-Rod comes to bat or Mario Mendoza. 
[02:20:00]  There's no comparison here.  Use a different example after last night's Yankee game.  He'll be fine.  He'll be fine.  He'll get late tonight with Cameron Diaz.  He'll step up.  But anyhow, the sad thing is, and I felt bad, and I followed Jim on Twitter, was we were backstage  with Greg, um, yeah, and that was sad.  Yes.  What happened?  Um, it was...  What happened there?  Are you working on an expose already? 
[02:20:30]  No, hey, whatever you guys want.  What's the temperature got to be in the body before you start fucking writing?  Bring this to top ten.  I'll write on whatever.  If you want me to do a whole book on the size of Opie's dick, I'll do it.  Whatever you guys want.  I'd love to read that.  And I'm helping you out.  Another fan checking it out.  Writing short stories?  Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  That was a good one.  My boy, listen, your highness, self-proclaimed asshole, you're a shit-starring dude.  I got shit in fucking traffic, and here you're ranting about your sexual browsing shit. 
[02:21:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Wow.  Wow, I thought he was a fan.  First of all, get your left hand off your cock in your car.  I know my voice is turning you on.  You're so aroused.  You just want to hear my voice.  And you're about to fucking, you know, you'll need the windshield wipers in about ten seconds.  I hope you get 50 years by a tranny and get better.  Listen, you moron.  Don't get in an accident.  Get that fucking hand off your dick, you fucking loser.  You've been dying to hear my voice. 
[02:21:30]  I haven't been on this show in a few months because I've been working on this motherfucking book,  Slaving Away, and now here it is.  Governator.  All that you want to do is fucking get aroused in your pinto while I'm here in New York on air.  His highness.  You're a zero, you're a mooch, and goodbye.  That's too high.  He's gone.  Fleece.  Does Ian do well with the ladies?  He does.  Yeah.  I'm surprised at that.  Oh!  Why are you surprised at that?  That's a backhanded compliment.  That's a hell of a friend right there. 
[02:22:00]  I've known Ian for 20 years.  Wow.  How'd you guys meet?  And, you know, when I first met Ian, I used to take him.  Was he judging the Michael Stipes look-alike contest?  He also looks like that other actor.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's all I got.  Love that guy.  He does.  He does do good with the ladies.  The bald guy with the glasses.  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.  I thought you meant the comedian guy.  Yul Brynner? 
[02:22:30]  Costanza?  Yeah, you look just like him.  That's amazing.  You've been told, huh?  No.  I want to hear the dirt on Ian.  Back in 1988, Ian played in television.  I got a lot of dirt on Ian.  You got a lot of dirt on Ian.  More terrific stories coming right up.  I know.  Apparently, Joe Jackson ran up the phone bill or something.  Eddie Murphy threw a lot of gutter balls, but then he'd blow the corn chips off his fingers  on that air thing.  And he rented his own shoes, but everybody thought that he owned the bowling shoes. 
[02:23:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Better watch it.  That's a rumor.  Now it's confirmed.  What do you got on Ian Halpern?  How'd you guys meet?  Yeah.  I used to...  I worked in the music industry for a while, so I kind of represented Ian when he was first  starting out 20 years ago.  Oh, as a musician?  Yeah.  But who do you represent?  What was he doing?  What kind of music was Ian doing?  He was doing stuff that was kind of ahead of time.  He'd go into this little club with his weird little keyboard thing and play a saxophone.  Would you have a Moog synthesizer?  He could smell it.  Like a little beatbox.  Yeah?  You know.  Oh, I got to hear some of that.  Did I have hot dancers around me?  Yeah.  I had hot dancers. 
[02:23:30]  His hair was blue back then.  Chippendales?  With that?  No.  Everything Ian told me I took with like five grains of salt that I really didn't buy anything.  Yeah.  A lot of salt.  As his career has progressed, obviously, he's gained more credibility with me.  Yeah.  Oh, so you thought he was full of shit.  For a long time.  Yeah, we all did.  For a long time.  It's weird.  Ian kind of wins you over after a while.  You're like, you're positive that he's completely full of shit.  And then you realize, oh, he did write that book.  Yeah.  And he did have this interview.  There is something to it.  And he was at this place.  As a music guy, who was your biggest artist? 
[02:24:00]  Lou Reed.  You mean who did I represent or who do I love?  Yeah, represent.  No, in height.  The crash test dummies.  Really?  Yeah, you were the guy?  Yeah, I discovered them.  Me and my team discovered them back in BMG.  Right.  And you know what?  Tell you about him.  That sounds like the real deal.  He was a nice guy, this guy Brad with the deep voice.  Was he?  Then he became an asshole.  Fucking dick, right?  And so we dumped him.  And now he just sits in a bar downtown and drinks and his career is done.  Is that it?  And that's a fact. 
[02:24:30]  God, what a life that is.  Downtown Montreal?  No, here.  New York he lives.  Yeah.  And he just...  No one would sign him because he became an asshole.  We could hang out with the crash test dummy guy right now?  We could right now.  What bar?  Down like in Canal Street somewhere.  He's always there.  Poor guy.  Just hanging out drinking?  Sad.  Oh, that's so sad.  Why don't you do a book on him?  That would be a pretty short one.  Yeah, well, you know, the way it's going, I'll sell four copies on Gobernator and two  on him.  He is depressed today.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I'm not depressed.  This is a different year.  You know what? 
[02:25:00]  It really is.  It's a different year.  You have been humbled by the camouflage.  I'm not humbled.  You are humbled.  I am humbled.  I equate this to the...  I equate me to...  Remember the ball player, Henry Rodriguez?  Oh, Henry.  The Yankees signed him for a boatload of cash.  I think he had two at-bats.  Or when they signed Pasquale Perez to a boatload of cash, he pitched two pitches.  Yeah.  That's where I am now.  I got paid.  I don't have to be here promoting.  Harper Collins is asleep at the wheel.  But it's a matter of pride in your work.  Yeah, I like to hit home runs.  You're very competitive.  Yeah, that's right. 
[02:25:30]  And you can't just take the money and run.  You want this to be successful.  Absolutely.  I think the betting's going to be very successful.  What media is showing up?  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, fucking primetime Sam Roberts is going to be in there taping for 18 shows.  USA Today?  You sure?  Gawker.com?  You sure?  They're all going to be there.  Okay.  Judith Regan?  You sure?  And I think, based on this book, as I see, I went from Simon & Schuster to Harper Collins.  That's like going from the Yankees to the Dodgers. 
[02:26:00]  I told the president, Anthony Zaccardi, of Simon & Schuster.  See, over at Simon & Schuster, I've had several books.  I only deal with him.  I don't think the guy's ever read a book.  But I don't even deal with an editor there.  They know when I come out of the book, they just get behind me.  They know everything in the book is rock solid.  And Harper Collins, it's a brand new team I'm playing with.  I love the people there.  The editor, Matthew Benjamin.  Best editor I've worked with.  But they obviously miss Judith Regan there.  And Judith Regan's a great friend of mine because she knows how to sell a book better than anyone. 
[02:26:30]  She knows how to look a crack, too.  But did she lick your crack?  We're very close.  We have the same birthday.  So because of that, you've got to lick each other's cracks.  Google that one, everyone.  August 17th.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  All right, listen.  Judith is God.  All right, listen.  You've got a competition on the line.  You're the highness, and we've got his majesty on the line.  Yo, his majesty.  You're in trouble.  Yo, his majesty.  What's going on today?  How are you doing?  You still alive?  You have a pulse? 
[02:27:00]  Hey, I'm his majesty, and I'm so famous.  You can ask.com it, okay?  Listen, I'm so famous, I don't have to go on the radio and beg women to suck my cock.  You're attacking me or him?  His majesty, how big's your dick?  My dick is so big, you'd look at it and go, I have to do an undercover story about it.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  When was the last time you squirted some love? 
[02:27:30]  Well, the last time I squirted love, your majesty, your highness, you should know, because his majesty was behind you.  Oh, there you go.  He's implying he fucked you in the ass and came up your shitter.  See, all these guys are calling me, because everyone does say I have the sexiest voice in radio.  Yeah.  I didn't dub that, but anyhow, all these guys.  This is when all of your homo crowd comes out.  Exactly.  They come out of the woodwork.  When I come on, because they're all getting their rocks off right now listening to me, and that's cool. 
[02:28:00]  I'm not homophobic.  His majesty, you got anything on that?  Oh, I absolutely do.  I would never get my rocks off to his voice.  I'm so famous, I get my rocks off to my voice.  Ah, he's jerking off right now.  He's jerking off to his own voice.  How does it feel, his majesty?  He's gone.  He's gone.  He's gone.  We got shiz on the line.  Shiz.  Shiz.  Hell yeah.  Shiz, where are you?  Shiz, Shiz, Shiz.  Where are you today? 
[02:28:30]  I'm in Jersey.  I'm in Jersey.  My condolences.  But anyhow.  Oh, there you go.  Take on the stage.  Listen, Shiz.  Listen, there's me.  I got two other brothers.  One in Jersey, one in Cleveland.  We love the show.  Man, what a successful family we got here, you know.  I'm an accountant.  Listen, listen, Shiz, Shiz, Shiz, slow down a second, all right?  He really did.  He made fun of his family because of where they live.  Shiz, if you could fuck anyone right now, who would it be?  Well, he used to be Kim Basinger, but I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  I like Basinger.  Hold on a second, Shiz.  See, we're on the same line here.  Basinger is hot.  Smoking hot.  She's down and dirty.  I would take her over Angie Jolie in their conditions today.  Angie Jolie?  No way.  Absolutely.  Oh, 100%.  Angie Jolie, those lips, I don't care what it is.  She's not banging.  I don't like those.  I agree, man.  She's one chick who puts out.  What info you got on Miley Cyrus? 
[02:29:30]  Miley Cyrus?  Not you.  Anthony, I've been so busy covering this Schwartzy thing.  I haven't followed anything.  You don't have any fucking dirt for us today?  No dirt.  I just wrote a 400-page book in like 90 days, and I'm like comatose today, and I'm going  into a bed.  You know, I don't know.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know.  Wow.  Yeah.  What is it about Arnie's politics?  He's not a Republican. 
[02:30:00]  Okay, so keep saying that.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  He's against the Republicans.  He believes they've been sold out to the religious rights extremists of high jobs.  So is he a liberal Democrat?  Yeah, and I infiltrate.  Seriously, I went undercover in the Republican Party for weeks.  Yeah.  I got close to all the top people in California, and none of them said they would let him run  on a Republican platform to become president.  They hate him.  They think he's...  Well, that's like Bloomberg did that.  He ran on a Republican ticket, and he's obviously not even close to Republicans.  But they'll never let him run. 
[02:30:30]  They're close to Republicans.  They're tired of Schwartzy.  They think he's way too...  They think he's more...  Here's the quote.  They think he's more liberal than the Clintons, Liberace, and Obama put together.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a statement.  Holy shit.  That's liberal.  I got breaking news, Ian.  Yes.  What is this?  And this is the God's honest truth.  I wouldn't lie to you, right, sir?  Yes.  In the last 25 minutes, Ian's book went from 97,039 to 98,665.  Now, okay.  Wait, that's place. 
[02:31:00]  That's not copy sold.  That's what place the book is in?  Yeah.  It is now...  It's dropped 1,626 places in the last 25 minutes.  What, did people give their books back?  What happened?  It updates, I think, slow.  No, it updates once an hour.  Every hour.  Is this true?  Where's Travis?  I mean, Travis is legit.  He just brought this in.  What's going on with this book, Ian?  I mean, people should be reading this.  I'll be behind this book, all the listeners, because I will come back on this show, and  if they want me to...  How did that happen, man?  You just drop another... 
[02:31:30]  If you guys can bring her to the top 10, I'll do an expose on Stern.  I don't care.  He's a good friend of mine.  We'll be lucky if we can get you it within the 50...  I can't talk.  Ian, this book is scaring a lot of people.  It's not scaring me.  I think people need to...  I think people need to read it.  Something's going on with this book.  Yeah.  You know, somebody...  He must have connections...  Somebody has connections at Amazon.  I find it hard to believe it's really 97,000, because I know...  That's crazy.  It's 98 now, by the way.  Yeah, 98. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  You know, something's fishy here, but I'm not going to back down.  I'm going to take this.  No.  This is...  You want to talk to more of your fans?  I want to talk to some chicks.  All right, more fans.  I mean, this is...  Where are the girls?  Girls, call up for Ian, girls.  Yeah, please.  Come on.  Where's the chicks?  We need a couple of girls to call him, but first we got Rick in Texas.  Rick.  Texas.  What part of Texas are you from?  Austin, Texas.  I love Austin.  Nuno's on 6th.  He's a good friend of mine.  His wife's name, Angie.  When I go there, I see Pine Top Perkins.  Have you heard of Pine Top Perkins? 
[02:32:30]  No, you shut the fuck up, because I'm talking about Pine Top Perkins, one of the greatest  musicians ever breathing.  He's 94 years old.  He still does 250 gigs a year.  What the fuck have you done lately, you mooch?  Pine Top Perkins.  You don't know Pine Top Perkins.  Give a...  Texas, give a plug for the book.  Go ahead, Texas.  I won't interrupt you.  Give a plug for the book.  I got a plug for the book as I'm standing behind it, and I'm jerking off into it. 
[02:33:00]  There you go.  There's a plug.  We got it when it bombed the first time.  What'd you do?  What'd you say?  Don't even start with me.  I'll plug it.  I'm standing behind it.  And jerking off it.  Hey, all right.  We got to move on.  I mean, the phones are lit, and everyone has some great observations and questions for  His Highness.  Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My condolences, too. 
[02:33:30]  It's motherfucking cold in New Hampshire.  What part of New Hampshire are you from?  Roy?  No, I'm Portsmouth.  Oh, my gosh.  Have you lived there your whole life?  I have.  How are the chicks in Portsmouth?  They're wonderful.  Yeah.  Do they make you smile the first date?  Fucking right they do.  Yeah.  When was the last time you got laid?  Uh, it's been about two years.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's not bad.  That's not bad. 
[02:34:00]  Two years.  For New Hampshire.  We're talking New Hampshire.  Okay, I forgot.  The ratio is six men per woman.  I forgot what you were.  New Hampshire numbers, right?  Yeah, six to one.  That's pretty impressive.  You should be laid by 2016 when Schwartzy makes a run for it.  The Governator.  Yeah, you'll be.  Use the name of your book.  Yeah, yeah, you should use the name of the book.  Use the name of your book a lot.  Call him The Governator.  The Governator on Amazon.com.  Here, I'm not going to plug it, but it's on Amazon.com.  It's called The Governator.  Author, Ian Halperin.  Yeah, it's on Kindle.  Is it?  Yeah.  Available for iBook. 
[02:34:30]  I don't care.  Just buy the fucking book.  Throw it in your fire.  Give it to your friends.  Send it to Ben Laden.  I couldn't give a shit.  But just take it in the top ten, and I'll come on this show.  Whatever you want me to write about, I'll write about.  Don't even read it.  That's a great way to sell it, Ian.  The winner is going to be cold.  Quiet to look at my picture.  I'm on the back cover.  Let's see.  Do I look hot?  You look like an official author picture.  Wow, very official author picture.  Ian, Rich has a very legitimate question. 
[02:35:00]  Yes, Rich.  Rich, go ahead.  Hey, Ian, if you are so famous, how did you infiltrate the Republican Party without being noticed?  Hey, that's a very good question.  You've got to go deep undercover.  That's kind of a legitimate question.  Yeah, sure.  I'll tell you how.  What'd you do, Ian?  Because when there's chicks at the front door, there's nobody better than His Highness to infiltrate.  Oh.  Okay.  I put on the charm, the sexy voice, a little poem, and the visions of night long, December 
[02:35:30]  night, hipster pants, magical mystery, Prince, the dance, and then I'm in.  Rich Schwartzy, in the book, the governator.  Right.  He hit on a Hollywood producer.  Yeah.  Twice.  First time was outside a cigar bar Shotzi's.  This is in 206, and he has a ring on his finger.  And then a few months later, at the Playboy Mansion, now this chick, this is no joke, it's  in the book, I was banging the shit out of this chick for months. 
[02:36:00]  Holy shit, no way.  He couldn't get even His Highness' leftovers, and this chick squirts.  When she comes, I mean, you're talking, the ceiling is getting hit with it.  Have you ever been with a squirter?  No, no, no.  I don't think I want it to be.  You've never been where the bed gets wet completely, you've got to change the sheets,  it hits the curtains.  Opie, seriously, have you ever been with a chick where you need an umbrella?  It's pee.  It's pee.  It's pee?  It's just piss.  They're pissing your bed. 
[02:36:30]  It's not a drink.  What about Norton?  Do you agree with that?  I've been with two in my life.  I get squirt as they squirt booze out of their mouth in the bed at night.  It's a little different.  No, but really, I was banging the shit out of this producer.  I've been with squirts.  You're terrible.  Schwartzy couldn't even get my leftovers.  Now, here's the deal.  In the book, the producer was at Heff's mansion.  In 206, she saw Schwarzenegger go into a private room with a Playboy bunny. 
[02:37:00]  He only came out two hours later.  In this private room, Heff has cameras.  Everything's on video.  So there's a sex tape somewhere?  Absolutely.  And it's all in the book.  The Governator.  The Governator.  Amazon.com.  All right.  By the way, Brocabulary.  Remember that book?  Sure.  Is at 97,000th place.  That was doing well for a long time ago.  We've got to beat out Brocabulary.  Hold on.  Is Norton ahead of me on Amazon?  Norton?  Yeah.  Or not. 
[02:37:30]  Absolutely.  You've got to beat lower than 97.  I would.  Happy Endings.  Happy Endings.  Happy Endings is definitely higher than that, Jimmy.  Has to be.  Absolutely.  Has to be.  Where's the women today?  I'm here, and so far.  We're trying, Ian.  So far, I feel like I'm at a gay bar on Canal Street.  Speaking of that, we've got Todd in Detroit.  He's very mad at you.  Todd.  Motown.  Todd.  Motown.  You're heinous.  You're heinous.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Your whole fucking state is broke, and you're trying to insult me or get to work. 
[02:38:00]  Do you have a job?  I just read your book about Governor Schwarzenegger, and I was wondering, why do you have such a  problem with the gays?  Oh, shit, Ian.  You've got a problem with the gays, Ian.  What are you talking about, man?  I'm the guy who went undercover in Scientology, posing.  Don't interrupt me.  Posing as an alleged gay actor.  I've raised more about discrimination.  I outed Travolta.  I outed Cruz.  And you're saying I have a problem with gays?  I've raised more awareness about homophobia in Hollywood than the Pope. 
[02:38:30]  I do angry gay sex.  That's all you're doing is trying to provoke a rape out of the gay community.  Are you gay?  I so.  Because, first of all, I like the name Myra.  Who are you named after in your family?  Not to interrupt, but Ian's friend has a scoop.  Back in 1986, the bassist from Devo took square dance lessons.  All right, sorry.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Got to get that out there.  Yeah.  It's got a lot of good nuggets.  I was wondering. 
[02:39:00]  What great, great, great, great grandmother were you named after?  What's her name?  Myra.  Yuck.  It was my grandmother.  Hey, fuck you.  Oh, that's right, man.  Myra is not a name I want to call out while spraying jizz.  Exactly.  Myra, are you coming to my bed in and you're going to spread your legs and get famous on TV?  Do you want to be in bed with His Highness the next two days?  No, but I would like to know if you knew that Schwarzenegger actually started out as a stage name.  Go on. 
[02:39:30]  Do you know how he got the name?  Yeah, let's hear you.  Let's hear it.  Oh, I'm sure.  No.  Give me a scoop.  Let's go.  You wrote the book.  How did he get his name?  I want to hear from her.  Oh, no.  That means you don't know.  I don't know who's in there.  Let me hear.  This is in the book.  I actually know her.  He had to write a lot.  Go ahead.  I want to see if she knows.  Go.  Wait.  No.  Don't fall for his tricks, Myra.  Go ahead.  We got him.  Myra.  Oh, Myra.  I'm coming, Myra.  Myra, I want to try it.  Oh, hold on.  What?  Please rant on my TV.  I said, Myra, I want to try it.  What'd you say?  We didn't hear you. 
[02:40:00]  The mic wasn't on.  Myra, we heard you.  I want to try it.  Oh, Jesus.  That's terrific.  Myra.  You know what?  I got to keep his mic on.  What are you wearing, Myra?  I'm sure that you know that schwarz means black, right?  Yes, schwarzer.  Like schwarzer.  Exactly.  But did you all know that nigger means cocksucker?  There you go.  Listen.  You know, I don't want to use the n-word.  Arnold used to use it.  I have fellow bodybuilders. 
[02:40:30]  Okay, Myra.  Hold on, Myra.  First of all, are you dressed yet for work or are you naked?  I'm actually off for the next few weeks.  So what are you wearing right now?  Just earrings?  I am wearing clothing.  Yeah, what are you wearing?  Tell me what you're wearing.  I asked you a question.  I'm not going to answer that.  Why?  Don't do it for me.  Are you just wearing nail polish?  It's not me.  It's about the listeners.  I'm trying to visualize.  He knows how to do good radio.  My name is Myra.  That's right. 
[02:41:00]  Myra.  Myra, out of all of us in the studio.  It means black cocks.  Out of all of us in the studio right now, whose cock would you take first?  Here we go.  Here we go.  I don't know.  I've got to challenge Anthony.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Apparently, he has a big dick.  Oh, it would be so nice to just yell out, Myra, Myra.  She's taking my hair.  Myra.  I'd be more turned on yelling, I stepped in dog shit outside of Pathmark. 
[02:41:30]  Ian, a lot of people are saying you sound desperate today.  They're a little worried.  Why am I desperate?  They're fucking desperate.  They're jobless.  I have a huge bank account.  I mean, is that desperate?  And you're doing a bedding for almost a day and a half or whatever it's going to be.  48 hours without food and just sex.  You're going to call room service.  Do I look desperate?  You're going to call room service, right?  You're going to call room service.  No, there's cameras.  It's all being documented for a little TV special.  You need a little nosh, right?  Don't you?  No. 
[02:42:00]  Dude, don't get crazy.  I mean, two days in a bed in a luxury hotel?  I mean, come on.  What are you going to try to do?  Kill yourself?  Yeah, what hotel did you pick?  What's next?  It's the Warwick Hotel.  Yeah, that's a rough hotel, man.  That's a down and dirty kind of cracky hotel.  It beats the Carter.  Have you ever been to the Carter Hotel?  Where is that?  It's across from the New York Time Buildings on the 43rd.  It's all roaches, Brazilian hookers.  It's the only place that's affordable in New York.  It's like 99 bucks a night.  No, they did a story recently on the worst hotel in America, and it's right in Times Square. 
[02:42:30]  We want to go check it out.  It's probably that one.  It might be that one.  Absolutely.  It has to be.  Have you been in there?  When I first came to New York six, seven years ago to live here, I stayed there for a year.  Wow.  Because it was the only place.  I did a deal.  You should write a book on that.  Well, I might.  I did a deal with the head of the hotel.  Because rents were so expensive then, I was paying like $1,500 a month to live in that hotel.  Did you hear that, Ant?  Rent. 
[02:43:00]  How much?  Rent.  Too damn high.  Too damn high.  Too damn high.  We got a gem coming from the back here.  Please?  What do you got?  In the mid-80s, apparently, Jimmy Buffett stole towels from a courtyard by Marriott.  Wow.  He does get all the scoops.  Please, you got another story for us?  Because we're running out of time with the big interview today.  I got a story about Ian once owed me 50 bucks when I was representing him, and he wouldn't pay me the money.  And one day, I saw him down in a nightclub with a friend of mine.  And I go, this guy owes me 50 bucks, and he grabbed Ian by the throat and strangled him, and Ian reached into his pocket and gave me the 50 bucks. 
[02:43:30]  And ever since then, we've been best friends.  What did you buy with it?  Arm hair?  Back hair, my man.  He bought a hot chick with a big Adam's apple in Montreal.  Oh, yes.  Did he?  That's an amazing story.  Thank you, please.  Any more chicks on the line?  Well, we got Millie Hatchett, it looks like.  Millie Hatchett.  Millie Hatchett.  That's Millie Hatchett.  Hey, guys. 
[02:44:00]  How are you?  Is this Millie or Molly?  It's Millie.  Millie.  How's Vanillie?  Where are you guys today?  Now, Millie, where are you driving?  Why don't you throw that line at her again?  I'm in D.C. right now.  And Ian, I want to make a deal with you.  Yes, baby.  Yes, baby.  I will buy your book.  Yes.  And you promise never to come on O&A again.  Oh.  See?  Oh.  You really, look, I got to say this.  On Twitter, I get so many Twitters.  Where are you on O&A?  You really don't want to hear my voice again, right? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, no.  Tell me why.  Tell me why.  Tell me why you don't like me.  I'd actually rather back up into my own doorknob.  It has more personality.  Holy shit.  Ian, you're going to take that?  She'd rather back her ass up into her own doorknob.  Well, let me hear her, because I studied child psychology.  That's a big doorknob, too.  That was my major before getting into communications, film, journalism, and becoming the top best-selling  author in the world.  Now, did you go to douche school by any chance?  Oh, you're so sweet, baby. 
[02:45:00]  Thank you.  You know, on behalf of all the O&A listeners, I'd like to take out my pistol right now and  put it all over your face.  Why don't you put it in your mouth?  Blow your head out.  You know, see, you'd love to, you know, you sound like Arnold's dad here.  And are you friends with Arnold?  No.  Really?  So why are you being so mean to me today?  What have I ever...  You drive me crazy.  I know I fucking drive you crazy because you haven't been laid in 17 years, you fucking 
[02:45:30]  hoe.  You skank in D.C.  You have nothing better to do with your life.  You are living vicariously through the number one author, multimedia artist in the fucking  planet.  And here you are, a loser.  You can't even get a job driving a taxi cab for the lowest hookers in D.C.  You mooch, you fucking zero.  Get a life, bitch.  You sound like you fucking... 
[02:46:00]  You can't even get used pussy in D.C.  Square, man.  You can't even get Barack Barry Obama's leftovers from eight years ago.  You're frustrated.  Very accommodating, asshole.  Oh, shit.  You know, you're like a poet.  She's gone, man.  She got you.  Yeah.  You fucking nailed you there, I think.  I hope she gets nailed.  We got a legitimate question.  Ed.  Hello.  Hey.  Yes, Ed.  And by the way, Fleas has something right after this, too.  Oh, good. 
[02:46:30]  I hope so.  Yes.  Fleas, you got another one coming.  I see it.  Go ahead, Ed.  Ian, your next book, Colonel Russell Williams from the Canadian Air Force.  You heard about that one?  Yeah, tell us about it.  Colonel Russell Williams murdered two people, all kinds of pictures on the internet of him  cross-dressing while he ran the largest base in Canada.  Yeah, that's been making the rounds.  Oh, it's pretty big.  He's pleading guilty to everything.  First of all, where in Canada are you?  I'm in a small town called Espanola. 
[02:47:00]  Where is that?  It's by Sudbury.  Sudbury.  See, I've been Sudbury many times.  I played at the Northern Lights Festival saxophone.  Yes, I know that one, yeah.  It's a great festival, and I have lectured.  Now, here you go, at Laurentian University and Nipissing.  Do you know that university?  What?  I just don't know anything about Canada.  It's in North Bay.  It's like an hour drive from Sudbury.  Now, Sudbury...  It's like made-up names in a movie.  I know, really.  Sudbury is like a flavor.  Tell these guys, for anyone who's never been to Sudbury... 
[02:47:30]  It sounds like Harry Potter or something.  When you go into a Harry Potter novel...  Right.  Where the fuck are these places?  We're from America.  Where the fuck is this?  Oh, the chicks are so hot in Sudbury.  God, my map just cuts right off the border.  Have you ever been to a strip...  No idea.  Have you ever been to a strip club in Sudbury?  No.  It's hot in Sudbury.  The women are so smoking hot in that town.  Why were you in Sudbury?  Because I lived in the area...  I've been to Sudbury many times.  There's another school.  I forget the name.  They brought me several times to lecture there. 
[02:48:00]  Then I went up to Nipissing.  I played at Northern Lights.  I love...  Nipissing?  I love the people of Sudbury.  I don't understand where any of this is.  It's Harry Potter's hometown.  Yes.  What the fuck?  Nipissing and Sudbury.  You know, there's a hockey player from Sudbury who played on the Canadians for a long time.  Ian, a couple of people want to know if you're from Dudbury.  I guess I am today.  Until the book goes top ten, I'll say I'm from Dudbury.  Or from Fredbury.  Sudbury, are you going to buy the book? 
[02:48:30]  Marvin Berry.  Sudbury, support the book.  Go to your bookstore right now.  You don't want to talk about the Air Force guy?  Yeah, well, the Air Force guy, that's been making news.  He's right.  That's going to be a good story.  We got a girl who wants to say hi, but first, please.  You got something else, please, sir?  What was it that?  You got a lot of stories.  What have you told me before?  A lot of stories about the music business.  No, I got stories about Wall Street.  That's what I used to do.  What about the music business?  I was a sport on Wall Street for five years from 97 until 2000. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, he used to work for short sellers.  And what do you got?  What do you want to hear?  I want to hear about the incident Michael Milken had one time where he was at the counter in Wolko.  Go.  Why don't you give us your best Wall Street story right now?  Okay, my best Wall Street story.  Yeah, let's go.  Isn't that ironic?  He said he worked for short sellers.  It was called CLCX, Computer Learning Company, which was a public school company.  And their stock was about $35 a share.  And we knew they were cooking their books.  We knew they were doing something, but we couldn't figure out what it was.  So one day I went to the Plaza Hotel dressed in my spy outfit with a fake name. 
[02:49:30]  And I went to a big shareholders meeting.  What was your spy outfit?  Oh, he dressed as a small child.  I had a trench coat with a fake name, Dave Stevens.  Nobody knew who I was.  Dave Stevens?  That was me.  Dave Stevens.  What a horrible fake name.  That's a spy name.  That's a spy name.  Sounds like the guy from Be With James.  James Stevens.  Yeah, they feel like a gay porn star I was checking in.  That's not suspicious at all.  Is that Dave Stevens of Falcon Pictures?  Dave fucking Stevens.  Dave Stevens.  And he's taking the spotlight away from you.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, lock it.  You still want to hear it? 
[02:50:00]  Well, you're a spy named Dave Stevens.  Dave Stevens in my trench coat.  By the way, he was also wearing a trench coat.  I was wearing a trench coat.  He worked for Vandelay Industries.  I worked for Fawn Stock.  Did you have an old school pipe in your mouth?  Oh, a trench coat.  I wish you were going to school in Columbine.  Were you with your buddy, Chess Rockwell?  All right, go ahead, Dave Stevens.  Anyway, so I'm Dave Stevens and I walk in and everybody's all happy.  It's a shareholders meeting and big CFO is there.  He's smiling and everything.  I go walk up to him.  I go, you know, sir, we think you're cooking your books.  We think you're full of shit.  We think you're a fraud.  And the guy turns all right in the face. 
[02:50:30]  No one had ever said anything like this to him.  They all thought it was all positive.  I go, what are you doing, sir?  How are you cooking your books?  He goes, well, we're not cooking our books.  Every time we meet a student, we book a year of revenue.  We go, well, that's okay.  That's what I needed to know.  And I went back and I told the DA of Illinois, every time he meets a student and interviews him,  he puts that down on the books as if that's going to be a year of revenue.  This was a fraud and the stock dumped down to 30 bucks and we made millions and millions of dollars.  I used to do all the time.  From 35 to 30?  From 35 to like 8 bucks.  Oh, he said 30. 
[02:51:00]  Okay.  I thought it must have been Canadian.  Oh, were you trying to buy Endicott Steel?  Anyway, it was just like that.  That's the kind of work I used to do.  My boss, he went to jail for like seven years.  Yeah?  For like money laundering.  But that's for another time.  But now, how come with that information and you short-selling, that's insider information?  It was complete insider information.  You broke the law.  Over and over again.  But that was before in Sarbanes-Oaksley.  In 2000, we all left.  But as long as you had the fake name.  Dave Stevens.  Dave Stevens is in trouble. 
[02:51:30]  You see my face, nobody else does.  You're like fucking...  It's the first time I've said this kind of stuff.  No, you're like the guy in Shawshank.  You made up Dave Stevens.  He had the fucking name, the bank accounts, everything.  You're free and clear.  Thank you.  Free and fucking clear.  That's amazing.  I got lots of them.  Governator, right?  Yes.  Governator, man.  He's going to number one.  All right, listen.  After that story, I'm going to give you a girl there, Ian.  Jess in Connecticut.  Jess.  Hi.  Now, I once dated a Jess.  I once dated...  I love the name Jess. 
[02:52:00]  Jess is a very big fan of yours.  Go ahead, Jess.  I am thrilled to talk to Ian Halpern.  How are you, dear?  Hey, first off, Jess, thank you for calling.  How are you today?  What are you wearing right now, sweetheart?  I am fully clothed.  I actually have a job, so I'm sorry.  I know, but what brand are you wearing?  Let's cut to the chase here.  Are you wearing Sears?  Are you wearing Dolce & Gabbana?  What the fuck are you wearing?  Banana Republic.  I got a note.  Where?  Banana Republic.  Well, Banana Republic's good.  The clothes are decent.  She's wearing a habit and shit-filled diapers.  Thank you, yes. 
[02:52:30]  Are you...  What have you got under...  You actually follow me on Twitter, Ian.  Yeah, what have you got under the girl...  First of all, first of all, what have you got under the girdle today?  Are you on the rag today?  Because I got a note.  Because if you're on the rag, you're going to be a bit hostile, and that's cool.  Do you have your period?  Is it that time of the month?  No, it's not.  But if I did have my period right now, I'd do your book as a pad.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Oh, man.  If you take your book and put it between a leg...  As long as she buys it.  As long as she...  Ian doesn't care.  He just wants you to buy it.  I think that's a great idea. 
[02:53:00]  All the women who are on the rag that time of the month, go get the book, and there's  photos of me in the book, and use it.  I don't know.  I'm not going to lose sleep.  Oh, God.  Stop shrieking.  You fucking foul.  Okay.  Hold on one second.  Yeah, first of all, who do you work for, you slut?  I actually work in IT.  Who do you work for?  Yeah, what's the name of the company?  Because your boss is listening right now.  He's probably jerking off in the office.  The door is closed.  His highness's voice.  What's the name of the company?  Oh, God.  That was fucking awful.  I want to tell you the name of my company.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Tell me the name of your company. 
[02:53:30]  Are your tits pierced?  My tits are invisible, honey.  They're like...  When was the...  Seriously, when was the last time somebody...  Gave you the torrential downfall on your face?  The tropic storm.  Was it Congolese?  Where was it?  Where was it from?  When was the last time you got some good black cock in your mama?  Holy shit.  Do you like the Congolese?  More than any girl I know.  Do you like the Congolese? 
[02:54:00]  Do you and your friends go to Congo?  Have you ever danced Congo music?  Do you like black cock?  Seriously, before...  I'll let you insult me in a second, but tell me.  Do you like black dick?  Never had it.  Why?  Are you racist?  Because a girl wouldn't take black dick, she's racist?  I absolutely am.  I'm actually...  What's the black cock dick?  Are you married?  Are you married?  No.  No wonder.  What the fuck's going...  Are you dyke?  No.  So, who are you dating?  When was the last time you got laid? 
[02:54:30]  A couple days ago.  How was it?  It was awesome.  Yeah?  How many times did you celebrate?  Celebrate?  It's selling radio, man.  I thought you were going to insult me, and then I can go back, and...  All right, Jess.  This is just like a run around.  I'm going to move on.  Jess the mess!  Jess the mess!  He found a rhyming word.  Why do you follow me on Twitter?  I'll tell you why, because I'm your secret admirer, baby.  And when you least expect it, I'm going to sneak up on your hot ass.  Do you want...  Here's the deal.  I'll buy your book, if Ann grabs his .45 right now and shoots you in the face. 
[02:55:00]  You really want to see that.  You want to see another Jew splattered by fucking racist America, right?  Ann, it'll sell some books, though.  You know what, baby?  We're not talking, you know...  Jess, do you want to come to the bed and really get to know me, baby?  Yeah.  Oh, she's gone.  Oh, baby.  Ann, what's the black cock about?  A lot of girls go down to some of these black areas, and...  Because a lot of women out there, they know I have a big dick,  and they're either into black cock or His Highness' cock. 
[02:55:30]  And the fact of the matter is, I tell them, look, get the Congolese first,  and I don't mind going in second.  We, uh...  Me and Ann saw the black cock happen.  Like, girls...  What?  Hey, slow down.  What happened?  That's the famous story, Ann.  The, uh...  A lot of these white broads that have, like, husbands or solid boyfriends,  they go down to these Caribbean islands by themselves with their girlfriends,  and me and Ann saw it happen in front of our eyes.  They get a little of the black cock,  and then we actually are on the same flight back home to JFK,  and we see a husband there to greet them and say, 
[02:56:00]  Hey, did you have a nice vacation?  That's how it works, especially in New York.  You know what I'm talking about.  She was from Connecticut.  Let's get into this.  All these chicks...  Where's the number one place where the white women go to get the black cock on vacation with their friends?  Where's that?  The Congo.  Just they go to the Congo?  Yeah, they love you in the Congo.  You get AIDS there.  They don't care.  They come back, and that's why America has AIDS, baby.  Yeah?  Because they go to the Congo, they go unprotected, they want the real deal.  They're back, yeah. 
[02:56:30]  And they come back, and they spread it like wildfire.  Damn.  That's not good.  Are we ready for another flea story, or no?  Anyone else on the line here?  Sure, we got Amber Lynn.  Amber Lynn from Detroit.  All the women come out when His Highness is on.  From the Motor City, Amber Lynn.  It sounds like...  What strip joint are you working at tonight, baby?  That's an ex-porn star name.  Yeah, there's Ginger Lynn, Amber Lynn.  Yes.  It's a guy.  Amber?  I have a question.  Are you into two girls, by any chance, yes? 
[02:57:00]  Keep going, keep going.  Come on, let's get some new jokes in here.  I mean, you're boring the audience.  You're boring everyone.  You're not original.  Come on, keep going.  You have ten seconds left before I'm booting you.  Listen, okay, okay, okay.  Okay.  You're gone.  You're gone.  That's it, Ian.  You're gone.  You're gone.  Why don't we go to a fellow Canadian?  You got Darren on the line from Canada.  All right.  Ask him what part of Canada is so me and have no clue where it is. 
[02:57:30]  Let's geographically, let's get our bearings here.  Canada, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Saskatchewan.  I sort of know where that is.  Well, the Rough Riders.  A friend of mine is dating a guy on the Rough Riders.  What's the Rough Riders?  They lost the other day.  What's the Rough Riders?  The CFL football team.  It's like Canadian football.  And it's the only team in the world where they used to have two teams with the same  name in the same league.  It was the Ottawa Rough Riders.  I've never understood that. 
[02:58:00]  Well, they got rid of the other two, the Ottawa Rough Riders.  You know what?  I like...  Ottawa.  I've got to be honest with you, Ian.  I love sports.  Yes.  I'm not...  I don't know one CFL guy.  I couldn't name one guy.  But let me tell you something.  Ricky Williams went to the CFL after he was a bit high up in there in Miami.  He was suspended.  And he did Schnee Bupkus.  The guy...  God.  Schnee Bupkus.  What's that?  He did nothing.  He was a zero.  Is that a legendary CFL player?  They've got to be doing something right in Canada. 
[02:58:30]  We've got Dick Bupkus and you've got Schnee Bupkus.  Saskatchewan.  That's right.  Yes, Darren.  Are you buying the book, The Governator?  The hottest selling book right now in the ONA studio?  It is huge.  Because there's nothing else moving.  Yeah.  Well, if you let me talk for five seconds.  Oh.  Hey.  You've now reduced it to three.  Hang on.  You have three seconds.  Good point.  Make it quick or I'm putting you right off.  You're getting...  I'm on Amazon here right now and I'm looking.  And I've got the book up here I'm looking to buy. 
[02:59:00]  And it's Happy Endings and it looks like it's a good read.  The other thing there, Ian...  Yes, yes.  ...if you're still listening.  Ramon, why are you following Jess on Twitter, you useless sack of monkey crap?  You know, you're so original from Saskatchewan.  First of all, you are living in the asshole of North America right now. 
[02:59:30]  I'm fucking getting laid in New York City, baby.  I'm getting Puerto Rican pussy.  I'm getting black pussy.  Jewish pussy.  You know, last night I was with an Italian broad on Wall Street and you are phoning me  with nothing to do.  Do you have a job, you motherfucker?  You bet I do.  What do you do for a living?  When was the last time you got a paycheck and for how much?  Read me the exact amount.  The exact amount I make is more than your mother makes.  Give me the numbers. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, I'm such a cock.  Your mom's such a cock.  Give me the numbers.  Give me the numbers, you mooch, you zero.  Why don't you talk to him in French?  I don't even believe he's some...  Yeah, merci beaucoup.  Tu as deux secondes, après je te jette dans la poubelle.  Let's move on.  Let's move on.  Ian just surrendered.  You heard it right there.  I want original people on here today.  Ian, I got a good question for you.  Yes, yes, yes.  Where's the best pussy in the world?  You've been everywhere.  Miami.  I've been everywhere, man.  And what kind of pussy are we talking about?  Miami's a port where everyone descends. 
[03:00:30]  If you want Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, Norway.  But I mean, what's the best pussy?  Like Cuban pussy, Puerto Rican pussy, black pussy?  Oh, wait, wait.  Jimmy, flea.  I was married to a Japanese.  No way.  You know, when you lick a Japanese breast, they come.  Very, very rare.  A woman can come just by sucking her tits or by playing with her nipples.  Japanese girls, the best.  So the best pussy in the world?  And they make these noises that you can hear, you know, three studios over.  They just roar and scream.  That's the noise.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:01:00]  Tub girl.  Look it up.  Google it.  I'd have to say the best pussy in the world is Bulgarian.  At this point.  And they're best friends.  What?  Bulgarian pussy.  Bulgarian.  Bulgarian?  That's weird.  Because it's pure.  First of all, they're so broke in Bulgaria, they can't afford any...  Don't do anything.  They'll give up the shitter, right?  Well, they can't afford any perfume, nothing.  Oh, so...  You know, all the vegetables there are organic.  They can't afford pesticides.  So they're retarded?  Everything is pure.  Oh, I've misunderstood.  When you go down, it either smells good or bad, and usually it's good for some reason. 
[03:01:30]  But it's going to smell natural.  Natural.  Yeah?  Yes.  No preservatives.  Bulgarian.  No additives.  Not Japanese, sorry.  And they come just by licking their nipple.  Wait, wait, wait.  A fleas is back.  What?  Yes, the Japanese girls come by playing with their breasts.  And they make sounds.  They make great moaning sounds.  None of you have been with a Japanese girl ever?  Have you ever shit on a Jap?  No, I've never shit on a Jap.  Japanese girls, they do a lot of those shit videos.  Yeah, they do a lot of weird videos, Fleece. 
[03:02:00]  I know.  You were married to a Japanese girl?  I have two little boys, half Japanese.  Oh, my God.  Little half Japanese boys?  Sonic and Basher.  My son's name is Sonic.  Sonic like the Hedgehog.  Gorgeous kids.  Gorgeous kids.  And a good dad.  A good dad.  All right.  Excellent.  Exemplary father.  Not a deadbeat.  A good dad is staying with him now, you mean?  I can't like that one.  I can't like that one.  I didn't know.  I didn't understand.  All right, Ian, you tell me where to go.  We got Jersey.  We got Alberta.  Let's go to the lines right now. 
[03:02:30]  You're on the OANJ show with His Highness.  Where do you want me to go?  The governor on Amazon.com.  Let's get some people on the line there.  Do we go to the end?  Anyone.  Just punch up anyone.  Why are you following Jess on Twitter?  Jess the Mess.  Why are you following her on Twitter?  Because my ex's name is Jess.  Oh, okay.  So you just follow all Jess's?  Absolutely.  All right.  Man, if you're going to hear me, you're full of shit.  Yeah.  You're so original.  This is Jersey.  I work for security for one of the biggest rock bands.  We throw this guy out of fucking parties every time he sneaks in. 
[03:03:00]  That's it.  That's it.  You're so original.  Name a rock band you work for.  Listen, you are living vicariously through me.  You've been unemployed probably for the last 17 years.  Pussy and pumpkin pie.  Oh, you're so beautiful, baby.  That's a good one.  What are you going to do today?  Hey, what's your schedule for today, darling?  My schedule today is to do absolutely nothing.  I'm flying back to L.A. in about a week.  And what are you doing there?  What are you doing in L.A.?  What are you doing in L.A., beautiful?  I run security for one of the biggest rock bands.  Are you gay? 
[03:03:30]  One of the biggest rock bands.  Are you gay?  Am I gay?  Yeah, a lot of those people, the security guards, you know, they're giving blowjobs to the band behind stage.  I've been to the party long enough to find that out.  You get as far as the fucking buffet table, and you get kicked out as soon as they see your face.  Oh, you know what?  You are so wonderful.  You wish you'd even have a paycheck remotely like his highness.  This is going to be fucking Perez Hilton holding your hand.  Oh, you know, you're so original, darling.  You sound like you've got to come out of the closet.  You're so angst-ridden, miserable, depressed. 
[03:04:00]  Where is the closet?  Where are you today?  Where are you today?  Where are you right now?  Where are you right now, sweetheart?  Your sources come out of your ass.  Oh, yeah.  Because you're nothing.  You make this shit up, and, you know, I'm jealous of you.  I don't know about that, sir.  He's had a bunch of bestsellers.  You tell me.  Look, dude, I don't have to defend my reputation to you.  I don't believe you work for any rock band.  You work for a cock band, baby.  It's all a bunch of women with Adam's apples. 
[03:04:30]  That's who you're representing.  You're probably their driver at best, picking them up five in the morning.  I just run security.  I don't represent you.  Yeah, you run nothing, dude.  Get a life.  Read the Bible, and then read the Governator.  All right.  Get educated.  The Governator sounds like it's going to be a great book.  What was that guy's name we just called in?  I don't know.  I forgot already, to be honest with you.  Is it Dave Stevens?  Dave Stevens.  Dave Stevens.  I one time bought, what did you buy one time? 
[03:05:00]  Stock for $17.  I sold it for $18.50.  Another story from Fleas.  Fascinating.  Fleas stories rule.  They are the best.  Fleas, you should write a book.  Seriously.  You got some good stories, sir.  Some of the best stories we've ever heard on this show.  You got another one?  A lot of different subjects.  I got one about a porn star named Sasha Hollander.  Google her.  I went to her apartment.  We were friends.  I was trying to interest her in some lingerie, and I'm hanging out with her.  And she had a shag rug, but not a compatible vacuum. 
[03:05:30]  I'm a porn star.  Please.  Someone else was talking.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Here's that head phone.  It's okay.  Start over, because Jimmy had a great line there that you fucking ruined.  That's all right.  But it's okay.  Yeah, so I went to Sasha Hollander's apartment.  To sell her lingerie.  To sell her some lingerie.  Is this her on the screen, by the way?  Danny found her.  She's an Asian girl.  Yeah, she's an Asian girl that was taken through the black cock.  Yeah, she likes the big black cock there, Fleece.  She's okay.  She's pretty hot.  Smart girl.  Used to be a...  She managed to call girls in California. 
[03:06:00]  Nice wide torso.  Now she's doing stuff here.  It's a cool wide torso.  It's great.  I love a wide torso.  There's a wide torso.  I see what widened it.  That fucking African gentleman behind her.  Jesus.  That crowbar.  Fucking God damn.  Putting Bubba Smith's leg into her.  She really hated Papa Son.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Anyway, so she had this Indian friend with her.  There was this guy.  And, you know, there were all these drug paraphernalia around.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  There's these little pipes around.  Yeah.  So I felt like doing a bong hit.  So I go, you know, can I do a bong hit?  And she's like, oh, yeah, sure.  Here, let me give you some of this stuff.  So I took a hit of this, what I thought was pot.  Next thing you know, my mind just completely fell apart.  I had no idea where I was.  I got down on the ground in a fetal position.  I completely lost it.  Wow.  They're giving me this drug from Pakistan, which is what they import from the United Nations.  And they have all these, like, young people coming in and out of New York to the United  Nations with these diplomatic pouches.  Yeah.  And they put drugs in there because they never get checked. 
[03:07:00]  So they had this stuff called Garda from the mountains of Pakistan.  And I did this thing straight up.  Hit me in my brain.  I didn't know where I was.  I remember reaching out, calling out for my children.  Where are my children?  I lost my mind.  It was like an acid trip that lasted about two and a half minutes.  No, it's still continuous.  In the porn star's apartment.  Oh, only two and a half minutes?  Next thing you know, Sasha is cradling my head.  They're feeding me bread and water.  It was insane.  Good way to make an impression.  There you go.  Exactly.  Way to hang with the big boys.  Fall down on the floor crying for your children.  If you don't position no less.  Wish she would have shit on you. 
[03:07:30]  Have to be fed bread to bring you back.  Way to fuck the porn chicks.  What are you, a fucking Robin?  Yes.  I thought I made a bad impression on poor girls when I walked in and went,  Hey, anybody got any AIDS around here?  Ian is here selling his Governator book.  Yes.  Doing a very good job, by the way.  What else is in the book?  We haven't talked about the book in a minute or two here.  Let me read you something from the book.  All right.  I see you got your reading glasses on.  He decided to take off his sunglasses.  His shades.  Oh, is this a live reading? 
[03:08:00]  Oh, this is what they do in bookstores, sir.  Oh, this is cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Not the bookstores I go, sir.  I refuse to do any readings.  Why?  But, um...  You should.  Yeah.  I'm just going through the book right now.  Holy fuck.  That was killer.  It's called The Governator, by the way.  You're looking for a page to read, I see.  It's just every word counts in this book. 
[03:08:30]  If you're...  If there's one...  If anyone could even find a typo in here, I'll jump off the highest cliff in Austria naked.  Fuck.  Are there a lot of cliffs in Austria?  There's so much in here.  I've never been there.  You're just turning pages.  Yeah, because it is so...  Jump off a cliff, Boris.  This book is so captivating.  No, really.  All right, give us a...  Yeah, yeah.  Give us a little something from the book.  Give us a little read from it.  Let us hear your reading, Boris.  And I want to...  Maybe a dramatic reading. 
[03:09:00]  I bet a lot of girls will fucking be turned on by that.  Please, sir.  Were these incidents simply an example of Arnold's often inappropriate but most harmless behavior  toward women?  The kind of behavior that Arnold's friends and co-star would dismiss as quote-unquote  flirting?  Or were there something else at play?  An almost pathological sexual compulsion, much like the condition ascribed to a number of  prominent members of his wife's family?  See, he...  His whole thing with the Kennedys from the get-go, he wanted to be a 10-years-old, a famous 
[03:09:30]  bodybuilder, an actor, and politician.  Slash limo driver.  He set his sights on the Kennedys, on the reassuring of the get-go.  So he wanted to be a Kennedy-er in that circle.  Absolutely.  From a very young age.  And Maria didn't want to marry the typical Ivy League stereotype person that you'd think  a Kennedy would seek. 
[03:10:00]  So Arnold...  She'd gotten a job at a local car wash in Dallas.  Anthony, do you find Maria hot?  No.  No?  No, not at all.  I don't like it.  She's got a fucking viper jaw.  Yeah, she looks like a praying mantis or something.  There's something going on there.  You think she's hot, really?  I think she's lost a lot of weight.  I say in the book that she definitely has a weight problem.  Oh, you think?  What?  Why?  And I answer the questions because Arnold sleeps with so many women. 
[03:10:30]  A lot of people ask His Highness, why does she stick with him?  And the answer is, maybe you guys are right.  She just can't get anyone else.  I think Arnold sticks with her because of the Kennedy connection.  Absolutely.  He wants to be President of the United States.  He wants to play golf with Edward Skagel.  That's some good Kennedy knowledge right there.  He sure can handle a club.  That's terrific, right, Ian?  Hey, Brian Miller Show on Twitter writes, tell Ian's boyfriend it's called salvia. 
[03:11:00]  You want to smoke in the salvia?  Oh, God, I'm done.  What?  In the mountains of Pakistan, it's not salvia.  Salvia.  Salvia.  This was something much more exotic.  Mountains of Pakistan.  Correct.  Yeah.  He's holding his stomach like Paco Moreno when he faked the injury.  Yeah, why are you holding his stomach, please?  You all right?  I'm okay, thank you.  Okay.  It was the coffee.  It was the coffee?  You got the shits?  It's all right.  Oh, your friend's got the shits?  Are you going to make duties?  It's all right.  He's got the shits.  Are you shitting into the pants of your zoot suit? 
[03:11:30]  Ian, he's got a shit.  Should we let him go or what?  I'll let him go.  This is all natural here.  Let him do his whole deal here.  We can film a Japanese porn if you like.  Yeah, really.  Who else is on the line, Opie?  Well, there's too many to...  I mean, let me do a couple comments coming in.  Can't fucking stand this fucking asshole.  You want to talk to that guy?  Or do you want to talk to...  Wants to say Ian is a douchebag?  Or do you want...  Hates Ian with all his passion?  Which one of those three?  Well, let's go to the first one.  The other two sound like...  All right.  This is Jersey City checking in. 
[03:12:00]  Jersey City.  Jersey City's a fine place, Ian.  I don't think you're going to have anything bad to say about Jersey City.  Jersey City's okay.  I've been in a couple of good restaurants there.  It's on the rise.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hold on a second here.  Anyone else buying this fucking line of shit that this guy's getting laid at all?  Yeah, actually, I thought he was full of shit for a while.  But he's done nothing but prove his points over and over again, sir.  Dude, I have to say, I saw Ian in Montreal with a very hot girl.  Give me a fucking break, dude.  He was with a very hot girl.  He's with hotties. 
[03:12:30]  I don't know.  We would all like to agree with you, but Mr. Norton was in Montreal and saw Ian with hot girls and came back.  From Oslo.  From Norway.  Oh, from Norway.  Now, when I walk backstage, I mean, Norton gave me a run for my money here because his girlfriend is smoking.  She's a very pretty girl.  I remember the last time you were on, the best line I heard was when you were telling that Dr. Z woman to think about black cock.  And Jim Junkie was like, oh, you too, mate.  That was a good line.  That was a good line.  That's a good line, right? 
[03:13:00]  Now, Dr. Z right now, I'll tell you one thing.  She gave me a good foot massage on my back.  Let's go to another line here.  Let's get someone original.  This is all a bunch of stiffs today using the same lines.  Ian, I'm going to do you a favor.  Let's go with, I want to say Ian is a douchebag.  Nick in Florida.  Nick, ask about part of Florida.  Where in Florida are you?  In the Gulf?  Yeah, I'm on the Gulf side.  Oh, yeah.  You drinking some of that oil today?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  You know, it amazes me. 
[03:13:30]  It took them just a couple of months to get all those miners out of Chile and to close  that Gulf spill.  It took them, you know, they couldn't do that.  Just a little hole they couldn't plug up.  It just amazes me.  Chile's way ahead of here.  Okay.  It was British petroleum, sir.  Well, not American petroleum.  Take your best shot at me.  Appreciate it.  Come on.  Come up with something original.  You're on radio here.  All you got to do is be on the radio, and that's your best shot.  You fucking suck.  You know...  There's a lot of hatred toward you today, Ian. 
[03:14:00]  What's up?  Because the...  They're jealous?  They're jealous.  They're Arnold fans that probably don't know how to handle the book.  That's true.  They're probably in the inner circle.  Are there any more women on the line?  Yeah, where's the check?  Does anyone have anything original to say?  Yeah, this big fan coming in from Long Island, Maria.  You like Long Island, at least?  Maria.  Anything original to say.  I bought the book.  Ian, are you depressed at the numbers?  The numbers aren't looking good right now.  The numbers are good in my bank account, man.  But it is my best book.  That's the saddest part, because this book, every word counts. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I'm going to help you out.  I mean, we're beating the shit out of Ian today, but I think this is going to be a good read,  and the numbers are going to be successful.  I'm defending Ian.  Yeah.  I've seen a lot of people that call on bullshit and everything.  Yeah, this guy knows how to write a book.  Yeah, the guy's done nothing but prove every point he's made.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Long Island.  What do you got to say about Long Island, Ian?  Hopefully some good things, because you're looking at two out of the three guys from Long Island.  One of my favorite Long Islanders, Mike Bossy, he used to be the sniper for the Islanders.  Billy Smith.  Billy was great.  I like Ferguson.  But Bossy knew how to put the rubber between the goler's legs. 
[03:15:00]  Billy Smith knew how to slash people across the throat if they came too close.  Exactly.  Joel Refkin.  Bob Nystrom.  Bobby Nystrom.  Brian Trotzier.  Trotz.  The Trotz.  Yeah.  What about Dennis Potvin?  Know all the great Islanders back in the day?  What about Clark Gillies, sir?  Brian Lafley.  What about John Tonelli?  Let's go.  Tonelli.  Where is he today?  Huh?  What's Tonelli doing?  I haven't heard from him in years.  Yeah, it's been a while.  I don't know.  All of those guys.  Fantastic.  Chico Resch. 
[03:15:30]  Remember Chico?  Oh, my God.  Chico.  Now you're going way back to the drive for five.  What happened to the drive for five, Opie?  I don't know.  Pat LaFontaine.  Let me tell you about...  That's a bit later.  Hey, let me tell you about Pat LaFontaine.  Pat Flatley.  Let me tell him.  Pat LaFontaine, big fan of F.H. Reilly, swear to God.  Really?  Calls my brother so much, my brother's like, wow, this guy's lonely.  Loves the gumbo at F.H. Reilly's.  That's a true story.  Pat LaFontaine.  Now, is Gar Snow still the manager of the...  He's the GM, sir.  All right, now let me tell you something about Snow. 
[03:16:00]  Jill Nicolini, we know already.  No, I mean, Opie, it's Anthony.  Well, first of all, His Highness was the first guy in Nicolini, then Anthony, then Gar Snow.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I don't think you took a virginity.  No, I mean, out of the three of us, it went in this order.  His Highness hitting first, Anthony in the second spot, and Mr. Gar's...  Who is clean up?  The lucky devil.  Cuckled joke.  I like Nicolini's bush. 
[03:16:30]  I mean, she shaves it, so it's really sweet.  So we got Maria from Long Island.  Yes, Maria.  Maria, go ahead.  Hi, Ian.  How are you?  You know what?  It's been a good experience today.  I love this show.  I love the listeners.  We love Ian.  And all kidding aside, I worked very hard on The Governator.  And, you know, I come on here, I'll, you know, I like to stir it up, but seriously, folks, I do need your support on this book.  It's called The Governator, Amazon.com, published by Harper and Collins. 
[03:17:00]  And I think, Maria, you have the same name as Maria, and you should be the first person to buy this book.  Yeah, that makes sense.  The first person to buy it.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, so I'm doing the bed-in.  No kidding aside, if you want to attend, just drop me an email, and you could come into bed with me for, and, you know, all the cameras will hopefully be there.  Opie and Anthony will be there.  Well, maybe.  I might stop by. 
[03:17:30]  Well, you know, I'll stream it live on your website or something.  But, no, all kidding aside, I'm doing it because I really do want to amend the Constitution.  I find it discriminatory.  Is that why you're doing the bed-in, to get Arnold a shot at the presidency?  Yes, I want him to be eligible to be around.  So why would you do anything nice for him?  No, he doesn't hate me.  He just wants to stop the book because he's worried about all the gay sugar daddy allegations in the book.  Maria, what are you doing today?  Who do you work for?  She says she wants to do the bed thing with you.  You want to come to bed with his highness?  Absolutely. 
[03:18:00]  But why only two days?  Well, look.  Got other things to do.  Again, my dad's a Holocaust survivor, and I don't want to, you know, end up looking like I'm in a concentration camp.  I want to do this with respect, with seriousness, and make my statement.  And what exactly will you do to me?  It depends.  Give me a description.  First of all, what are you wearing right now?  Well, I'm headed to work, so, you know, business classes and all.  Well, give me what's underneath.  Where do you buy the lingerie? 
[03:18:30]  That's the first thing.  I want to know what type of taste you have.  I actually tend to not wear a whole lot of it.  Nice.  Sexy.  So are you saying you have nothing under your pants right now or your skirt?  You're going, you know, you're going to get chapped lips in this cold weather or something?  Like, give me the deal.  Well, no.  No, I have, you know, I have pantyhose on underneath the skirt, but I'm not about it.  Yeah.  Hose.  She's wearing some suppose. 
[03:19:00]  Support hose.  Some hosery.  Give me a description of your physical formation.  Well, it's a very small waist, 30, 60 boobs.  Coincidence, Ian's a huge waist.  He didn't like that one.  That's funny.  He doesn't want to laugh, but he is.  Yeah, that is funny.  All right, guys.  Do you have a boyfriend, girlfriend?  You know, because I don't like to disrupt relationships. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I actually just got out of a relationship, and I did have a girl on the side, but, you know.  All right, tell me about the girlfriend.  Tell me about the girlfriend.  She was too much of a trouble.  She had her own relationship, and she was just trying to, you know, experiment in lesbianism,  and she wasn't very good at it.  So what kind of work do you do, if you don't mind me jumping in?  Because you said you were dressed for work, so I wanted to know what type of an outfit  you might have on, besides peggy clothes.  Oh, work in a lawyer's office. 
[03:20:00]  Ah, there you go.  Exciting.  Who's the lawyer?  Raoul Felder?  Who is he here?  It's not Dominic Barber.  Give a plug for the law firm.  Is it Dominic Barber?  Because you're out on Long Island?  The city's broke.  Give him a plug.  Maybe there's somebody out there who's going to launch a lawsuit against this show today.  The shyster mesothelioma fucking lawsuits.  Is that what you do?  Your ambulance chasing fucking bitch.  Or you belong to a very small law firm, and you sue the children who tattle on their pederasts. 
[03:20:30]  Very niche practice.  To sue a seven-year-old for crying on the stand and getting someone inducted.  Maria, do you want to join us?  Listen, first off, Maria.  I don't know if this is going well, Ian.  She sounds good.  Okay.  I like the fact she has a girlfriend.  I'm not convinced she really broke up with a boyfriend. 
[03:21:00]  She's just telling me that to try to appease me.  How bad do you want to get into bed with His Highness, baby?  Tell me exactly where you're going to be in a few hours.  I'll tell you what.  Hotel room bed.  All right.  Let's get her off the air.  Let's get her phone number.  No, let's get her phone number.  Put her on hold for me.  Put her on hold.  Get her phone number, and I'll call her.  And if she's legitimate, she's going to get to spend a few minutes in the sack with His Highness. 
[03:21:30]  You're going to love this next call.  Kevin in Philly.  Kevin.  Yo, I got to say, Ian has drove me crazy for years.  I hated him on the radio, but for some reason, this appearance is cracking me up.  You want me out, right?  I may even buy your book.  Oh, Philly.  Philly.  God bless you, Philly.  Let's stop it right there before it gets on.  No, no.  He likes to be out.  Tony Taylor, Dave Cash, Larry Boa.  This book is going to be dedicated to them now.  Let's bring it home in Philly.  Harold Carmichael.  Yes, yes.  Why don't we talk old school?  And Michael Vick.  Ron Jaworski. 
[03:22:00]  Michael Vick.  Ron Jaworski.  Very good.  What about old school Flyers?  You know the Flyers?  All of them.  Old school.  Paul Holmgren.  Bernie Perrault.  Keep going.  Don Seleski, baby.  Rick McLeish.  Bobby Clark.  Ed Van Pimp.  Edmund Kemper.  Schultz.  Schultz could go.  Schultz was the tough man.  Against Pierre Bouchard of the Canadians.  It's a legendary brawl.  Al DeSalvo.  Hold on.  I think Schultz.  Ross.  What was his name? 
[03:22:30]  Ross.  Kenneth Bianchi.  Ross Lonsberry.  Ross Lonsberry.  I don't know him.  Schultz and Gillies used to go at it.  Yes.  I think they've had some bad.  Yeah, Schultz was the tough man.  Schultz was the animal.  It goes on and on on that team.  That was enormous.  And Mike Schmidt, you didn't mention.  Oh, Schmitty.  Wait, did Schmitty just come up?  Mike Schmidt.  Dudley, do you right?  18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  Yeah, Mike Schmidt.  With two very bad knees.  What happened?  Yeah, who was that?  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player? 
[03:23:00]  What happened?  I think God, the dream came true.  What a baby.  That's terrific.  Quit your whining.  Put his head in gravy and wrap it up with...  Bubble gum.  Yeah.  Then you send it out to some branch of the military.  Yeah, Navy, they use it.  They put it in the water like a bully.  A bubble gummed head.  Gravy.  Emphasis on the boo. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  In fact, sharks.  Jimmy, Fleece just raised his hand.  Oh, what do you got?  What do you got?  I got a Craigslist story.  Oh, a Craigslist story.  All right.  What do you got?  I will hug you for 20 bucks.  I said, I want to do that.  So I sent her back an email.  The name is Tui.  Hug me for 20 bucks.  So she meets me outside on my work.  That's the sound she made when she saw you.  The most beautiful...  Wait, hold on, slow down, Fleece. 
[03:24:00]  Okay.  There's some laughs going on.  Ian, you got to teach this guy how to do radio.  Look at the laugh, sir.  Okay.  All right.  Back up your story.  What happened?  Okay.  So on Craigslist, I see a girl.  Put an ad out.  I will hug you for 20 bucks.  Okay.  So she comes to my work. 
[03:24:30]  What was her name?  Her name was Tui.  Holy shit.  So there's Tui.  And she's this hot Vietnamese-American girl, 20 years old.  God, get over your fucking fetish.  Exactly.  Oh, Christ.  Sounds like you got a type.  We get it.  So what happened?  People walk in and go, now, why are you going to want to hug a guy in his mid-40s?  Why are you going to want to hug me for 20 bucks?  Next thing you know, you'll be like... 
[03:25:00]  Next thing you know, you'll be like sucking my dick for some stranger guy.  I go, what's your problem?  She wouldn't tell me.  I go, okay, I'll give you the 20 bucks.  You're going to hug me.  Well, she threw her pointy hat in your car.  So we go to a park, and I give her like a 20-minute hug.  Grab her ass.  She's just this beautiful young girl.  I want to do it again the next day.  Uh-huh.  So she comes back again the next day.  But she was running naked down a road covered with napalm.  That's actually where she was running away from his hug. 
[03:25:30]  Into the napalm.  She'd rather run into the napalm.  Holy shit.  So I'm like, why do you want to do this?  What is your problem?  Why do you need the 20 bucks so desperately?  She was wearing a hazmat suit.  All right.  Sorry.  So she says, okay, I'll tell you the problem.  I did an overdraft at the Bank of America.  Hopefully she has lice. 
[03:26:00]  They're holding you on my account.  I got $300, $400 in there, and they're not releasing it.  They're all in your arm hair.  I go, Tui, I can help you with this.  Tui.  So we go to the bank, and I work in the non-profit world now.  That's what I do.  I raise money from rich people.  So I go to the bank, and I go, look, there's this young girl.  She did an overdraft, and she's sitting there, all Vietnamese and everything.  All Vietnamese and everything.  That's pretty funny.  So I go to the guy, and I go, listen, give this girl a break. 
[03:26:30]  She overdrafted her protection.  I want to help her.  Erase this bad thing.  And I wanted to help this little girl.  I didn't want her to keep doing this prostitution type of thing.  $20 for a hug.  Next thing you know, it's something more and more and more.  Where was she, Canada?  No, right here.  Just like a few months ago.  Here in New York.  I do the Craigslist thing a lot.  There's a lot of opportunity out there.  Is she still hugging people?  There's a lot of opportunity out there.  No, I helped her.  Opportunity.  So the Bank of America guy made the whole thing go away. 
[03:27:00]  Her overdraft was done, and I changed this girl's life.  Next thing you know, I was getting the free hugs, and I'm teaching her piano, and she's  just doing fine.  So that's an example.  You still know her?  I still know her.  Does she do anything besides the hugs at this point?  No, I just changed that whole thing.  Just hugs?  No more hugs.  No more anything from money.  But what about for you?  No, we're just friends now.  That's it?  No, I moved on to other adventures.  No, fuck it, fuck it.  No, fuck it, fuck it.  No, no, fuck it, fuck it.  Fuck it, fuck it.  Oh, my God.  That's my crick list. 
[03:27:30]  That's just one.  Too beaucoup, hair.  That's an amazing start, please.  Oh, me so nauseous.  Gary Del Body just emailed me.  Oh, yeah?  All right, so you're going to go on there for a legitimate interview.  Yeah, now he's thinking, now they're reconsidering.  Of course.  They're probably listening to this show.  And hearing all the laughs, right?  No, because Howard's been talking about the Swedish princess.  Uh-huh.  And I kid you not, I met the princess this summer and partied with her. 
[03:28:00]  I enjoyed her fish.  Sorry.  Her name's Madeline.  I didn't get to them.  I couldn't get past the meatballs.  The massage was good.  I have dirty stories about the Swedish princess, Opie.  Yeah, you really?  There's photos of me and her.  Knowing you, you'll tell Howard and not us.  I'm going to tell you because Howard's late.  If you snooze, you lose with his highness.  Oh, our whole audience is losing. 
[03:28:30]  I licked her toes in a bathroom in a restaurant.  Yeah?  And what happened?  She got aroused.  And then what happened?  She told him she had just stepped in.  Then she was making out with a woman.  I didn't go the full nine yards.  No?  Why not?  I aroused the princess.  Oh, really?  And actually, her mother doesn't like the U.S., apparently.  He used to work for her mother, the queen of Sweden.  Hey, how about a story about working with the mother of the queen in Sweden? 
[03:29:00]  Do you really have a story about that?  You guys are fascinating.  I don't know if I have a story about that.  But she doesn't like the United States because they used to stalk her daughter.  I don't know why the daughter moved here, either.  Yeah, they didn't.  That's crazy.  The daughter was banging Lundqvist on the Rangers.  Wait, he's got a story.  Henrik Lundqvist.  Well, no, Ricky Martin.  Ricky Martin wanted to give her mother a lot of money.  How much to hug him?  But now he came out of the closet.  He said he's gay.  Right?  And then the mother said, we don't want your money.  We had a million dollars lined up.  I don't want Ricky Martin's money.  They don't want their gay money. 
[03:29:30]  Gay money.  Her fiance was cheating on her, and then they found out she was cheating on the fiance with  Lundqvist.  That's crazy.  That's a backstopper for the Rangers, who are probably going to win all of 11 games this  year, the way they're going.  Oh, damn.  Wow.  Hey, Ian, Brian Miller Show, my new friend on Twitter.  Yes.  He might be confused, or not.  He says, I hope the bed-in is at a hospice.  Do you want to comment on that, sir?  I mean, the bed-in is a very serious thing you're doing to make sure the governor becomes 
[03:30:00]  the next president of the United States of America.  I'm trying to amend the Constitution.  It's at a hotel, and we're going to see where it ends up.  You never know.  Maybe, Maria, the caller's going to be in bed.  There's going to be some hot hookers.  I'm inviting all of New York's hookers to come, and there's going to be food for them,  not for me.  I'm going to have to watch them eat.  Eat out all day.  I hope your pillow ends up like Lincoln's after the play.  We got something else.  Opie's waving an exclusive.  A big exclusive here.  Guys, I got another exclusive.  Very good news.  Travis just ran this in.  Yes, Greg.  And Travis is legit. 
[03:30:30]  More, more, I'll just say more news.  More news.  In the last hour, Ian's book has dropped another 3,359 places.  How does that happen?  It's now in 102,000.  Oh, my gosh.  And 24th place, sir.  Wow.  So you should give the big plug for the book.  We're losing everybody.  Again, guys, I got paid.  Right.  And I got late.  I was banging the producer, Schwarzenegger, couldn't.  Now, listen, guys.  That's it.  If you take it to top ten on Amazon, I'll come on this show, and we'll do a one-hour poll, 
[03:31:00]  and you guys get to choose the next subject.  Okay.  So just buy it, burn it, throw it off buildings.  I don't give a shit what you do with this book.  We got the official stats.  So when you started the interview, you were in 97,039th place.  A mere hour later, you were in 98,665th place.  Right now, as we speak, you're in 102,024th place.  How'd that happen?  We're moving on up.  What about the – any more callers? 
[03:31:30]  Sure.  Are the lines jammed when I come on?  They sure are, sir.  Justin in New Hampshire.  Justin.  Hey, how's it going today?  Anyway, let's cut to the chase.  Let's stop wasting time.  You're on the number one radio show on the planet, and you're –  Talking about a book that should be number one, The Governator.  What's the full title again, Ian?  The Governator.  From Muscle Beach to His Quest for the White House.  The Improbable Rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Sure.  By Ian Halper, number one New York Times bestselling author. 
[03:32:00]  I'm at 102,000 now.  We've just got to cut that down.  All right, let's go, Justin.  What do you got?  Well, I just wanted to call.  I've heard him on the phone a couple of times, and I've just been really entertained by this  interview all morning, and I plan on buying your book this afternoon.  Thank you.  Thank you, New Hampshire.  Thank you, sir.  You're a straight arrow, sir.  Straight arrow.  Jim Norton, too.  All right, Justin.  We should hang out before you get started.  Yeah, let's start moving.  Let's start moving.  I want to talk to everyone before you guys eject me from this show. 
[03:32:30]  You know the Craigslist story?  We're hugging.  Yeah.  I got more stories.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Another Craigslist story.  You got another Craigslist story?  This is...  All right, let's cut this Craigslist.  One more caller, then let's cut this Craigslist.  Oh, you want to do that?  Yeah, just think of the Craigslist story.  All right, what do you want?  Apologizing on behalf of all Canadians for this douche?  It's your call here.  Well, I want to help you out here, so maybe we should go...  You are the pilot here.  I am the passenger, sir.  Okay, why don't we go with the Canadian guy? 
[03:33:00]  He's apologizing for all Canadians.  We got Tim in Calgary.  We almost know where Calgary is.  Let me apologize for him, first of all.  Yeah, the Calgary stampede every year.  It's a big rodeo thing.  And you know the United States is going to eventually steal Vancouver, right?  You're going to lose Vancouver to the United States of America, sir.  All supported.  I love America.  It's going to happen.  I love Americans.  It's going to happen.  I love America.  And let's hear what Calgary says.  You got three seconds, baby.  Calgary in the house.  Three seconds.  Your time's up.  Let's move to the next caller.  No wasting time here. 
[03:33:30]  Let's go straight ahead right now.  Who's on next?  While I was on hold, I was taking a look at your book on Amazon.com.  Yes, yes, sir.  You should be on Amazon.ca, by the way.  You're in Canada.  Canada, right.  It's .ca up there?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  See when I'm on Amazon.ca right now, what number?  It doesn't have to be.  So anyway, I'm looking on page four here, and it really gives an in-depth look at your investigative  style of reporting.  Yes.  You talk about being in Schwarzenegger's tiny village of 2,000 inhabitants. 
[03:34:00]  And while you tried to find where he was living, you talked to some people here.  You finally said to a woman on a bike, Schwarzenegger house.  And she smiled and pointed the way.  This is the kind of investigative...  You just went to the first woman, Ezra Schwarzenegger house, and bought that she was pointing at  the proper house?  That takes a lot.  He had to fly over there.  That is true.  You know, that's why...  He can't do that.  And he was surprised that people didn't speak English in a tiny village in Austria, so he 
[03:34:30]  just walked around...  Yes, because...  Schwarzenegger house.  All right, see, at least you're reading the book.  You're getting an education.  That's all you care, right?  And have a good life, baby.  I'll see you upstairs one day.  But so far, what you're saying is true.  And if you read on, you will discover more on the cooperation of the house, the village,  the this, the that, the Nazi.  So thank you, sir.  Good plug.  And Felice is chomping at the bit.  Oh, my God.  But first, a big plug for your book, sir.  It's on Amazon.com.  It's called what?  It's called The Governator. 
[03:35:00]  Right.  It's by Ian Halperin, number one New York Times bestselling author.  The Governator from Muscle Beach, This Quest for the White House, The Improbable Rise of  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  If O, B, and A, and J show here can take it to number 10 or higher, I will write my next  book.  It's your choice.  The listeners.  All right.  Very good.  And the bed-in starts right after the show.  Right after the show.  I'm going to the hotel.  And the O&A cameras are going to be there.  You're going to be naked?  Yeah.  My publicist just emailed me.  Apparently, there's a lot of requests coming in now. 
[03:35:30]  So, yeah, I'll be naked in bed, dude.  See what we did for you?  I wear my birthday suit.  I wear my birthday suit when I come out.  Remember, we were the first to promote this book, sir.  Absolutely.  Now they're coming out of the woodwork.  I am indebted.  All right.  I'm indebted to you guys forever.  Felice, you got one more story for us, please, sir.  One last Craigslist story.  The other day, I see a ad.  Hold on.  What?  Craigslist story?  He just jumped right into it.  I know.  He really did.  No sex, just play with my breasts.  And I go, I'm disciplined enough to do this type of thing.  Breast play, yes.  Just breast play, you know? 
[03:36:00]  Was she Indian?  No.  Guess again.  Puerto Rican?  Big, large black woman.  Oh, okay.  From Central Africa.  Named Emily.  That's so insane.  And I met her.  And she came up to my apartment, and I played with her breasts.  These big, giant bazookas.  Did you offer to take her hatch baskets before she walked in?  And then what happened?  Well, it just kind of ruined the whole thing, but...  Why?  I met a woman on the Craigslist, and I...  The Craigslist.  Sure enough, she came back up to my apartment.  How much did it cost you to play with her big, awful tits?  Not a penny, and I couldn't believe it. 
[03:36:30]  And after that, she wanted to fuck.  So I ended up fucking this large African woman with her giant breasts.  Fat women from Central Africa, known for their wonderful tits.  Big bald.  Big bald.  Did she have an accent, or was she really, like, from the Bronx poker? </pre>
