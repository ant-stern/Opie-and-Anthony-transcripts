<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a mocking discussion of the media's overblown coverage of the polar vortex, blaming *The Day After Tomorrow*, Al Gore, and Bill Paxton.  They criticized the Weather Channel's storm naming practices as hype, contrasting the media frenzy with their own experiences with harsh Buffalo winters.  This segued into a discussion of various news stories, including plane crashes and a faked news report about a missing girl.  This led to tangents about Mars and the origins of humanity, before diving into a lengthy, sarcastic analysis of numerous local news segments showcasing the "frozen t-shirt" experiment, highlighting the perceived lack of originality and critical thinking.  A Minnesota caller confirmed the extreme cold, prompting further ridicule and a suggested "frozen panties" experiment.  A clip of a reporter making sexual comments during the experiment was played.  The death of radio personality Bob Grant was then mentioned, with shared anecdotes.  The upcoming guest, Dean Cain, and a segment about a Bigfoot sighting were briefly previewed.

The show then featured a segment heavily mocking MC Search's daytime talk show.  The hosts repeatedly ridiculed Search’s attempt at a "street" persona, contrasting it with his perceived privileged background.  Multiple clips from Search's show were played, focusing on a segment featuring a man who fathered multiple children with overweight white women and didn't pay child support.  The hosts found Search's attempts at mediating the conflict highly ironic.  The segment included playing music from Third Base (mistakenly called Ace of Base by the hosts), commentary on Search’s Facebook page (vandalized with penises), and a guest appearance by Dennis Falcone.

Next, the hosts discussed their New Year's Eve DJ gig, followed by a bizarre phone call from someone claiming to be Marion, denying having a Twitter account despite evidence to the contrary.  A heated argument between Chris Cuomo and Dennis Rodman was previewed.  Dennis Falcone then joined the show, discussing his "Super Show" and a sequel.  The conversation shifted to Taylor from Starz facing repercussions for an outrageous segment, leading to a debate on radio programming and unconventional content.  A disastrous car giveaway involving a rusty Mustang was discussed, along with past media run-ins and near-firings.  Dean Cain then joined, discussing a Bigfoot bounty for Spike TV, touching upon marijuana legalization, gun control, Bigfoot DNA collection challenges, remote filming difficulties, and various conspiracy theories (aliens, the Loch Ness Monster).

The final segment focused on the hiring of a black female comedian on SNL, speculating about pressure due to criticism over the lack of black female cast members since Maya Rudolph.  This led to a discussion of the fairness of this decision and affirmative action in comedy. The firing of a radio host for a joke about a gay man's prison sentence was discussed. A contentious phone call with "Lady Di," seemingly intoxicated, about Marion and her Twitter account, provided comedic moments.  SNL's history of showcasing black talent, including Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, and Tim Meadows, was analyzed, along with specific SNL sketches.  Finally, a lengthy discussion about Dennis Rodman's trips to North Korea and his contentious interview with Chris Cuomo occurred, with heavy criticism of Rodman’s actions.  Jimmy Norton promoted his comedy shows at the end.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  ...of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, good morning, everybody.  There it is.  After that grandiose summation.  By Stacey Keech.  By the wonderful Stacey Keech, yes.  Stacey Keech, the voice of the Opie and Anthony channel.  My God, man. How cool is that?  Fucking decent, I must say.  So we're in the middle of a polar vortex.  If I hear this fucking polar vortex again,  it's such horse shit. 
[00:00:30]  Why is it horse shit?  Because, and why hasn't anybody brought this up?  It's all fucking from that goddamn movie,  A Day After Tomorrow.  What?  There were three polar vortex over the northern hemisphere.  What is a polar vortex, though?  Just a lot of cold air.  In the movie, it's like a fucking giant ice hurricane.  And it was sitting over the United States and Russia  and fucking over.  Is that possible to have?  No.  Oh, okay.  And, and, and, uh, it's like spinning. 
[00:01:00]  And the cold air that was dropping through the middle  Right.  Was super fucking cold.  That it would just freeze you instantly.  You'd go, and just freeze.  And that's what they were.  And now all of a sudden, out of nowhere,  no one's heard this fucking,  now they're starting to use it in the weather fucking forecast  like it's a real thing.  I blame the weather channel.  I blame Al Gore.  Al Gore?  I blame Bill Paxton.  Bill Paxton?  He was in that.  Another spinning horrible weather thing that he was part of. 
[00:01:30]  It's an arctic polar vortex.  It's already here.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, uh, I, I, I blame the weather channel because they've decided to really up their  game and instead of just talking about the weather, now they got to name the storms and  stuff.  Unofficially, they name storms now.  Was that just a weather channel that decided, hey, we're going to do this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like it wasn't some fun.  But then everyone else has picked up on it and said, yeah, okay, we'll, we'll name this 
[00:02:00]  storm.  Hercules.  All right.  It was Hercules, right?  No, it's Hercules.  Yeah.  Why would you, why would you do that?  For hype.  Nothing but hype.  A named storm.  But the weather channel should just be the weather channel.  Why are they trying to hype their shit?  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Why hype your shit?  I like their original program.  What was that?  You know, wind.  I watch a whole show about wind.  This, this weather this morning, what, what are we at?  Like five degrees. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Way under that with the wind chill.  Yeah.  This reminds me of Buffalo, New York.  What?  I will, we'll talk about that.  Which one is it?  What happened?  I watched it yesterday.  Did you?  I haven't seen it yet.  I've seen the trailer, but not the show.  It could be the worst thing I ever saw.  All right, we'll talk about it later, yeah.  This weather reminds me of Buffalo, New York, when I did radio up there.  This is the type of winter they have up there all the time. 
[00:03:00]  But it's, it's, it's like constant?  Yes.  My point is, how do you live there?  We're going to be a bunch of pussies in New York City for the next two days, whining and  crying about this fucking horrible cold weather.  Uh-huh.  But this is normal for, you know, a lot of people.  What the fuck is that?  Chewing footage, new video of deadly plane crash.  Where was that one?  Iceland.  Wow.  Yeah, that thing came right down, uh, kind of missed, huh?  The problem is it was like 50 yesterday.  That's the problem with weather. 
[00:03:30]  It was lovely yesterday in the, in the morning.  Yeah.  I took my hat off.  Oh, yeah.  It's a 50 degree drop in one day.  That can't be healthy for anybody.  Uh, yeah.  That can't be healthy for the planet.  You just stay in.  Yeah.  Just stay in in your false, uh, environment.  But watch, uh, all the pussies whining and complaining because we're going to have two  days of this.  Yeah.  Two lousy days.  I remember weeks on end when I was in Western New York of this shit.  I couldn't imagine.  Single digit temperatures and wind chill.  You know, that was my experience. 
[00:04:00]  But then you got the Minnesotas and the rest of the places.  They deal with this shit every winter.  I don't know what it was.  It was someplace, uh, around there, you know, like Fargo kind of shit up there.  But they said, uh, colder this morning than, uh, on the surface of Mars.  Damn it.  You beat me to the puss.  That was my little tidbit.  That was your tidbit?  That was going to be my little thing.  Maybe we should, uh, we should stagger the stations we listened to on the way in.  You take 88, I'll take 10-10 winds, and then on every other day.  Wait, is that true though?  How cold is Mars?  Yeah, I thought Mars was so cold that you can't do shit up there. 
[00:04:30]  But if, but if, but if it's that cold, then we might be able to live up there.  There are some times when Mars is, you know, the, the, the bright side facing the sun and  everything on the equator.  Right.  It could get up to 70 degrees, so.  Oh, no.  It's not all that bad.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  No.  So that means we, we definitely jumped planets then.  Yeah.  It gets very hot there. 
[00:05:00]  But we jumped planets.  Yeah.  You think we jumped planets?  Yeah.  I think something happened there.  I think, yeah, we, we weren't supposed to be on this planet originally.  Yeah.  It's so obvious to me.  Every time they look a little deeper into, uh, Jesus Christ.  They look a little deeper.  What is that now?  It's like the rec channel we're watching.  It's just nothing but.  Fox News is rocking it this morning.  Plane crashes, tractor trailers, hitting abutments.  Almost hit a cop.  Wow.  He just missed a state trooper.  Ah.  The cop you idiot.  And then this stupid Dennis, we have a lot to do today. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into Dennis Rodman.  Rodman.  Idiot.  Yeah.  I really do think that, um, that, uh, at some point, the more they look into Mars, it's  like, uh, maybe, you know, maybe something was there like a billion, a billion years ago  or something.  Yeah, of course.  And just completely no sign of it now.  Because, uh, you take our planet, you strip away the atmosphere, you evaporate away the  oceans, you let it get pummeled with some meteors for a billion years.  It'll look pretty bad, I think.  And then we'll jump to another planet.  And we gotta go to, like, Venus or something. 
[00:06:00]  And then time will just wipe up, wipe out everything.  Yeah.  And then people will try to figure out, did people actually, uh, used to live on Earth?  We're not really sure.  We're looking for signs of life on Earth.  Whether, um, but so far, nothing.  Our probes have found nothing.  Because once again, it's the human perspective.  Yeah, yeah.  We have no concept, really, of what time could do.  They don't even know the rover is rolling right over Manhattan.  And they're like, it's just a vast wasteland of lifelessness. 
[00:06:30]  We're, we're, we're looking for water.  Yeah, water is really the key.  We're not really sure if Earth had, had, had water at one point.  We haven't really found any evidence that there was water.  We're thinking frozen water may have been trapped in its core.  And then if these idiots from, uh, the, the future land their, uh, their rover in a desert.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, and then what the fuck?  Like, of course you're not going to find anything for a long time.  Yeah, you land in the middle of the fucking, uh, Sahara Desert.  Yeah.  Oh, this planet's sandy and hot. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  There's nothing here.  Let's move along.  Move along.  And all they had to do was a hundred miles to the east and they would have found glory.  But Mars really gets to that point?  Yeah, Mars has a, but Mars has like, uh, really sweeping temperatures.  It'll get really hot.  Right.  But then it gets really fucking cold.  What's really hot?  I don't know.  I believe it'll get hotter than it gets here at some point.  Sure.  But, uh, but then like it's fucking freezing cold, like ridiculous cold.  But is it really colder in North Dakota this morning than the surface of Mars? 
[00:07:30]  I would guess that somewhere on Mars, it's warmer than in North Dakota right now.  I would guess, but I bet that happens a lot.  Well, I'm learning something new.  Mars.  I didn't think that was possible.  Get your ass to Mars.  See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.  We got John in Minnesota.  It's been below zero for the past two weeks here.  Yeah.  Well, listen to New York City bitch like little fucking babies the next couple of days.  It's going to go up to 40. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And then we're out of it.  Maybe mid-40s by the weekend.  So we're like, oh, it's cold.  But we'll whine and bitch.  How cold is it now?  It's like the guy actually ran off to get me a cab this morning.  It was five.  He grabbed anything he could find.  I've never seen him panic like that.  Really?  Yeah.  He was happy anything with wheels came by.  Oh, wow.  Like one of those livery cars.  There was no livery.  Yeah.  It was five, but then we got some wind chill action.  So I don't know exactly.  It's terrible.  You can't breathe that shit in.  It's fucking painful.  If the smoke goes away quick when you watch it out of the exhaust, that's how you know  it's cold.  Oh, yeah.  When the exhaust comes out of the cab and the smoke's like, ah, it's just fucking gone 
[00:08:30]  immediately.  Why don't we do some of those frozen videos?  Oh, where we could throw some water in the air and watch it freeze.  I don't know if it's even that cold.  It's not.  It would just land on somebody, but you get punched.  They're fucking, now they're cold and wet.  The hot one to do this season is the frozen t-shirt.  Frozen t-shirt?  You don't watch enough local news like I do.  I obsess with this shit.  I'm assuming you put a wet t-shirt on.  No.  Oh, wow.  You just kind of, you know, put a t-shirt in a, well, it can't be a puddle, obviously, 
[00:09:00]  but you pour water over a t-shirt, and within seconds, it's a stiff board.  And a lot of local news channels are doing that experiment to show you how cold it is.  Could you show me one, Sam?  I thought maybe you'd put it on.  See, the frozen t-shirt experiment from Good Morning Connecticut.  But they're all doing it, and they can believe that they came up with this.  She's not afraid of a little bit of cold.  She's live outside to show us.  She's got a giant thermometer.  Show us just how cold it is.  I'm not afraid of a little cold, everyone.  Hey, Jeff, bring on the cold. 
[00:09:30]  You know what?  Last night, some parts of the team-  I'd fuck her.  I'd fuck her right in her pussy.  Pause.  Now you put me in a bad mood.  Didn't we fucking talk about that video yesterday?  Yes.  So why did I get 20 more tweets about it?  It's fake.  What's wrong with these people?  The news guy.  Yeah, that missing girl?  Yeah, I'd fuck her.  I'd fuck her right in her pussy.  He starts doing the fuck moves.  All he should have said, I'd fuck her.  Or I would like, she's got a great tits.  They should have kept it subtle, and that would have been fairly overdid it.  But we said yesterday how fake it is, and then all day, you guys got to check this one out. 
[00:10:00]  Guys, check it out.  And then they call themselves fans.  Do they listen to the show?  Some of them might have done it sarcastically.  You're hoping that they weren't that stupid.  I know.  You really hope that it is.  But at this point, you can tell the guy's doing it sarcastically.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, we went with the winky face thing years ago.  Right, right.  Throw that winky face at us.  Then we know you're being a little sarcastic.  It's colder than a witch's tit out here, Mike.  Right.  Nothing like that. 
[00:10:30]  The frozen t-shirt experiment.  Back to this broad outside in Connecticut somewhere.  But they're all doing this exact same thing.  Oh, the frozen t-shirt.  Oh, I'm excited.  Could you pull the mic back this way?  So I can see the tiny postage stamp video that Sam puts up there.  But my point is this.  These news channels, they've seen other news channels do the frozen t-shirt experiment.  So why can't you just be a little different and do frozen socks?  Or panties.  Anything!  But please, have you fucking...  We all saw the Conan clip. 
[00:11:00]  Right, I know.  You know.  Oh, maybe we should do the frozen panties experiment today.  That would go viral.  Ah!  What do you think?  Oh.  Yeah.  Can we borrow your panties?  Ah, see?  Because you're right there.  You're early-ish.  You have a pussy.  Frozen boxers.  People, why is there shit in the front of them?  Well...  Long story.  Oh, you guys.  See?  But we did.  All right, go ahead.  All right. 
[00:11:30]  Nine.  Oh, it was bitterly cold.  But just to show you how dangerous some of this stuff can be.  Oh.  Look at this thermometer.  It says...  Oh, it's big.  Zero.  It's hovering around zero.  Maybe it's broke.  It is cold.  Columbus House here.  They're taking care of people who need a place to go.  There are a lot of shelters who had extra long hours last night, not turning anyone away  because they know how dangerous this can be.  But this...  We did a little bit of a science experiment this morning. 
[00:12:00]  Hello.  Look at this T-shirt.  We put it in water.  I told you.  And we just put it...  We hung it on this hanger for about five minutes.  And look, it is solid.  Why are they amazed that water freezes at zero degrees Fahrenheit?  Bicycles are dangling on the side of the water.  Yeah.  Well, that's what happens.  Amazing stuff.  It's not amazing.  It happens in your freezer every day.  That would be amazing if they did that in Hawaii.  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  It's not amazing.  No.  Be careful out there. 
[00:12:30]  Holy shit.  Don't go outside and eat wet T-shirts.  And then they go, be careful.  Oh, Jesus.  That is the least amazing thing that could happen.  They were drips of water that were freezing.  Now they're a solid.  But it is amazing because you don't usually see that on a T-shirt.  Does she fill her ice cube tray up, put it in her freezer, and then come back and look  and go, honey.  Right.  It's amazing.  The water is now little cubes of solid material.  But that's a hot experiment these days.  That's the big one they're going with? 
[00:13:00]  Give me another one.  I'm telling you.  You can find one very easily.  I say you wet a T-shirt, put it on a guy, and now freeze it and watch him die of pneumonia.  Eager to see what's happening here.  Wouldn't it be fun if the exact same news channel just did it on a different time shift  with a different reporter?  Would you think they would do that?  Is this the same news channel?  Yeah.  News 8.  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  Oh, wait.  I know that, bro.  It's Connecticut.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Someone was trying to set me up with her years ago.  Jafaka. 
[00:13:30]  Jafaka.  No.  Right in her pussy.  When I was single.  That's what my friends used to say.  Jafaka.  I knew a cameraman for one of the local channels here.  And he was trying to set me up with her.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, your loss.  Really?  No.  Okay.  I got it.  Remember, before commercial break, we decided to show you just how cold it is with a little  science experiment.  All right.  Let's get a little progress report now from Bob Wilson. 
[00:14:00]  It's still frozen.  Bob Wilson.  Outside in Hartford.  Bob?  Bob?  Yeah.  I'm checking the timer here.  It says 6 minutes, 44 seconds.  We've been gone.  Get that glove back on quickly here.  Take a look at this.  This shirt doesn't even really need a hanger anymore.  There you go.  It is straight up and down.  You can hold it by the arm.  It was long sleeves, too.  It is.  Yeah.  Wow.  You can bang a little.  Listen to this.  Why are they...  You can ring the bell with it there on the railing. 
[00:14:30]  It's fucking solid.  And the point is here is that your skin is affected very quickly by the wind chill and  the water on your skin.  You put it on and jump off the bridge.  That's terrible.  That creates the evaporation.  That creates the dangerous wind chill that can lead to frostbite, which is when those  the water inside the skin freezes, bursts the blood...  Oh, I hate this guy.  ...when it bursts the vessels apart.  So...  He has no idea what he's talking about.  He doesn't know what he's saying at this point.  He just knows that this frozen t-shirt thing is really hot this season. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Go to the end.  I want to see when they go back to the anchors.  Oh, my God.  We'll stay...  Just take a look at that and realize, you know what, you've got to keep your skin covered.  I'm Bob Wilson, reporting live in Hartford, News 8.  We're actually playing catch with Ted Williams' head, and it's still fine.  Right.  If he could ever cure this disease, he'll still be fine.  Very cold out today.  I bet you can't find another one.  I bet you can't find another one.  You can probably find another one from the same station.  Right.  That was the same station.  That's terrible.  But they used a different shirt.  That was a long-sleeved shirt. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And he banged it on the fucking railing of the bridge.  Right.  That was different.  That was different.  He kind of made it his own right there, didn't he?  The Mornings reported the big news where they tried doing it on her clothes, and she died.  She's dead now, so they had to get him out with a new sweatshirt.  Hyperthermia.  Now, who's this?  News Channel 5, WEWS.  Where are they?  That doesn't matter.  But it's somewhere cold.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  Fargo?  It doesn't matter.  Who gives a fuck where they're from? 
[00:16:00]  Cleveland.  Cleveland!  There it is.  They know cold winters.  Maybe it was Brainerd.  No.  It's cold.  You know how they know cold winters?  Frozen t-shirts.  That's exactly right.  Frozen t-shirts.  It's the hot fucking thing to do on local news this winter.  Frozen t-shirts.  Fungy-wungy bars.  No?  What happened?  Well, what are you going to do?  You're going to have to start somewhere.  They sound delicious anyway.  They really do.  They were.  I remember getting a few at Jones Beach.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On your side, a demonstration on just how quickly things can turn dangerous for us. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, please do.  I do, Josh.  I'm in Newburgh Heights.  It is 13 degrees out here.  Wow.  And we have a little bit of a science experiment that we did.  We put a wet t-shirt outside in this 13-degree weather here.  Look at this.  This is the t-shirt.  If I could just show you.  I mean, it is frozen solid.  Okay?  So I just put this t-shirt under the sink here.  Put it out.  It took 20 minutes for it to get like this.  20 minutes.  So by the way, it says, don't judge me.  My mornings start at midnight. 
[00:17:00]  So a little bit of joke for all of us.  See, she used a pretty sure.  But it just gives you a perspective of how dangerous.  Yes, the cold weather is uncomfortable.  But it is dangerous out there.  We're talking cross-bikes and starts in a matter of minute.  Yeah, she made it her own that way.  Funny shirt.  Also, some drowsiness.  So keep in mind, people are going to be out today.  They're going to be shoveling, snow blowing.  It's a Mike house every weekend.  Because of the snow that's on the ground, I did check in with some emergency rooms. 
[00:17:30]  I want to mention that just to see if they had any cold-related injuries.  And they said no.  So MetroHealth and Clinic, no, not at this point.  But that could easily change this morning.  Because look at this.  It's around in a wet t-shirt.  Oh, unbelievable.  That's not unbelievable.  That's a very good demonstration of just how dangerous it can be out there.  If you're sweating, if you're shoveling, you are right on.  Very good job.  We'll check back in with you.  What's good about it?  I have to get more on that.  She froze a t-shirt.  Wait, why is there more to the video? 
[00:18:00]  This is where it gets good.  And let me tell you something.  He's saying it's very dangerous.  Look how dangerous it is if you're sweating and stuff.  If you're sweating and shoveling your snow in 13-degree temperature, wearing a t-shirt, it's probably dangerous.  I would assume when you bundle up, regardless of if you're sweating, your body heat alone will keep it from freezing.  Well, sure.  As long as you're not just wearing a t-shirt.  So, the lesson here, don't just wear a t-shirt in 8-degree temperature.  Thank you.  Even if it's hilarious.  Even if it's that funny t-shirt like she's wearing, demonstrating there. 
[00:18:30]  Let me see what else he does with this.  Asshole!  Well, today, expect it to be one of the coldest so far this year.  We're on your side with information about where to go to warm up out there.  Starting here.  How about inside?  Yeah.  You know what they should do in the summer?  They soak a t-shirt in gas and throw it on a fire and go, look, heat!  It's amazing!  Did you see that t-shirt go up?  Yes!  Amazing!  He says it's incredible.  He looked at that like the fact that temperatures below 32, freeze water, was just the most fascinating thing. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Is that it for the frozen t-shirts?  Those aren't even the ones I saw.  Wow.  You got another one!  This is a thing that must be like a prep burger for the news.  That's what I was thinking.  Where they're like, you know what?  Hey, guys, did you get this t-shirt?  Right.  You put it in water?  Which is fine, but why wouldn't you just twist it?  Twist it around.  It's all about twisting it if you're in the... 
[00:19:30]  Get some long underwear.  Whatever.  Do that, and then put it against yourself and walk funny.  Right.  Then pop your dick through it.  And then she puts her mouth on it and it gets frozen.  And she goes, eh, eh, eh, like it's stuck to a flagpole.  Right.  I'm in.  You're being unfair.  You haven't seen whether or not Denver has a twist on it.  All right.  Let's see what Denver does with the frozen t-shirt, please.  Bob's still in weed. 
[00:20:00]  Weather deck.  Chris?  Yeah, Jeremy, when it gets this cold, we have to bring out the old wet t-shirt experiment.  And this one is already starting to freeze.  But what happens when you bring this out here for about 15 minutes or so?  That's all it takes.  Stiff as a board.  All right.  This is the Iceman.  This is Bob Shepard's answer to our frozen t-shirt.  Oh, there you go.  I'll do you one better.  That's different.  I'll do a t-shirt and a pair of jeans.  And I'll stand it up.  And it's standing up.  Look, it's standing by itself.  This thing is solid.  This is dangerous cold.  This is the third year we've done this.  And every time it ever fails. 
[00:20:30]  Any guess who that is?  Yeah.  It's me with a snowblower out there today.  A picture of a guy with a snowblower.  Yeah.  What are we supposed to be shocked that you're like all of us?  Snow the rapper.  He's a snowblower.  He's blowing him, Jim.  And here's the snowblower as he sings informant.  Why was that picture on the news?  The guy with the snowblower.  Because that was the anchor.  Oh, look at me.  I get it now. 
[00:21:00]  He has to deal with it.  I guess that's it for the frozen t-shirts, huh?  Probably it, right?  Is that it?  Not many frozen t-shirts.  No.  Now, you know, we're going to fucking mid-show at some point.  We're going to find one popping up on one of the channels.  We're watching.  Of course.  And if you take a wet t-shirt.  Phew.  Amazing.  That'd be funny.  They did to a homeless guy.  He was just there and they hosed him down.  Just freeze him in place.  What is this one? 
[00:21:30]  WTNH.  Oh.  Which is Connecticut.  It's the same station.  Connecticut loves a wet t-shirt.  Is it the same station, you think?  I don't think so, no.  Is it big eight there?  Yeah, I think it's news eight again.  Yeah, let's see if they change it up a bit.  This time.  Freezing, what is it?  All right, temperatures below freezing.  What does that mean for us tonight as it gets even colder?  Let's check it out.  Bob Wilson out in it in Hartford tonight with a little demonstration as to how dangerous this cold weather can be.  It's the same guy.  It really is something to take seriously. 
[00:22:00]  As a matter of fact, we put this t-shirt in water about 15 minutes ago, 12 minutes ago.  But within three minutes, it was frozen solid.  And I'll show you.  It really, it's just a...  It's the same railing.  I don't know how to try it, but he's not wearing a hat or gloves this time.  I bet you can even snap it in half.  I don't know, but you can...  You can't snap it in half.  You can't snap it in half.  It's pretty frozen.  And you know, when you see these happen, report it.  Oh, look, it's a station shirt.  That's what happens when you stay out here.  And this is how we have your back.  This is kind of like what wind chill is.  When you get water on your skin and you have the wind blowing across your skin, it will freeze up your skin much faster.  And that's what happens. 
[00:22:30]  So be careful tonight.  Who allows water to get on their skin in this temperature?  And doesn't dry at all.  Right.  Immediately.  Yeah.  How many cases of the average person walking for five minutes outside are there when they end up frozen?  Right.  They're frozen.  I told you.  We tried to warn you, you asshole.  And this asshole wants to look good on camera so he has no hat or gloves on.  That's way worse than his stupid frozen t-shirt.  And by the way, I think he went with a station t-shirt right there.  Yeah.  But that's the third different t-shirt.  From the same news channel. 
[00:23:00]  It's a different experiment now.  This is so stupid.  I guess that's it with the frozen t-shirt.  I remember for a while they would do the water where they would throw a pan of water out a window and it would just turn to little ice crystals.  People are burning themselves doing that.  There's a story on BuzzFeed that people are burning themselves with boiling water from throwing it up in the air.  That's hilarious.  They're doing it in Ecuador.  Oh, right here in New York they did it. 
[00:23:30]  What?  NBC local in New York.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see this one.  I bet you it's a little different, though.  Okay.  Well, it's New York.  It's got to.  You've got to step it up.  Number one, right?  Number one market.  Come on.  Step it up.  All right, we want to turn on to Jonathan Vigliotti, who is in the north of us in the city of Bedford.  Hey, good morning to you.  We're here off of 684 in Bedford, New York.  It is frigid outside.  How cold?  And there is a lot of snow.  We're talking about six to eight inches of it falling overnight. 
[00:24:00]  You can still see it falling right now.  It's a very light, powdery snow travel for making snowballs, but perfect for skiing in,  and more importantly, especially this morning.  He threw like a girl, by the way.  Very easy to get out of the streets.  However, the one problem that this powdery snow presents is the minute you plow it,  all the high wind just keeps blowing it back into the streets.  Again, you're looking here at 684.  I spoke with one person who's been out in a plow for the past 12 hours.  He says every hour he's got to come back.  He's saving the best for last in his little report. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to go out with a bang.  Go out big.  You've got to go out big.  You've got it.  He's getting too cold.  The wind chill makes out well below zero.  That means that all the salt that has been placed out here on the streets is not working.  And what could that do to someone or some?  Uh-oh, here we go.  You may not recognize this at first glance, but this.  What is it?  What is it?  What is that?  What an idiot. 
[00:25:00]  He actually said you may not recognize this at first.  No, I think we got it.  It's a frozen thing.  What is it?  I don't know.  It's amazing, though.  It looks like arms and a head and a torso could go through it, but it's not bending.  What the hell is that?  So it can't be a shirt.  Oh, my God.  Can you go back?  The news.  I can't get enough of this shit.  This is fantastic.  They're just a bunch of idiots.  I love it.  You may not recognize this at first.  Yes.  That's right.  Yes.  If you're from a tribe where you've never worn clothing, if you hunt elk with your bare hands, 
[00:25:30]  you may not recognize this.  If you're in Western civilization, you'll know immediately.  All right.  Let's go.  Here it goes.  What does that look like?  How do we visualize that?  I want to show you a little prop I have here.  You may not recognize this at first glance, but this stiff board is actually a t-shirt I passed in my overnight bag.  What?  It's so cold outside right now.  So in less than two minutes, come on, it froze.  So this is a reminder. 
[00:26:00]  First, if you're going outside again, it's a snow day for many people here in New York.  It's going to be very cold.  So your kids are going to want to bundle up.  Adults out there, you're going to want to bundle up, too.  Not on that t-shirt.  I'll tell you that much.  That looks cold.  And if you are going out on the road, you can imagine the icy conditions just looking at this out on those roads.  You're going to want to take it easy today and let those plows do their job and clear off the streets.  Back to you.  John.  Did they comment on it?  They go, wow.  Yeah, the comments is the best.  From Bedford with what is now becoming his famous Armani-fitted white frozen tea.  Our coverage of this. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, wow.  Well, it's famous because he's the only one doing that.  Right.  He's the only one.  It's a great idea.  I guess that's it, huh?  Yeah.  That's too bad.  This guy opened his window.  Right.  On Fox News.  In Chicago.  In Chicago and just let it snow.  All right.  How cold is it going to go today?  Right now, outside our world headquarters, Marie, I see you over your shoulder.  It is four degrees.  Frozen t-shirt?  Yeah.  It's very cold outside.  And it's actually so cold that we did a little science experiment.  No.  No way.  This is live. 
[00:27:00]  This is live.  This is live.  This is live.  This is live.  Come on.  It's a video of us taking boiling water.  Okay.  Running outside with it.  We threw it into the air.  And throwing it on someone's t-shirt.  And throwing it on a non-white.  Cold is across portions of the Northeast.  And the National Weather Service is out.  Dude, I thought she was going for it.  It's being cold for those not in shelters.  So please save us.  Maybe CNN is, though.  All thanks to these winds that are just howling out here.  Did you do an experiment?  With temperatures that feel like they are 10 below.  Come on.  What'd you do?  It's making it truly unbearable.  And that is the story for millions of Americans today. 
[00:27:30]  You're not showing us shit.  As that cold Arctic air today has spread from the Midwest all the way in now into the Northeast.  It's cold.  Polar vortex.  Polar vortex.  Polar vortex.  The coldest air in decades gripping.  It's the extreme.  Yeah, it's cold.  It sucks.  We know.  Yeah.  The temperature isn't something that's felt by your car or by a building.  Oh, really?  It's actually what your skin feels like.  Oh.  Oh.  A building doesn't feel it.  That's right.  That's why buildings don't wear jackets.  Did she just tell us a building doesn't feel it? 
[00:28:00]  I'm stunned.  Well, that's why my building hat store didn't last.  Did you have a hat for a building?  I didn't block long hats for buildings.  I invested millions and lost it all.  Did you sell any?  Zero.  Buy a hat for your building.  The governor of Illinois issued a disaster declaration.  Oh, God.  It's just mindless.  It is.  That's what it is.  It's mindless.  Who watches this and gets actual real information?  I need to know.  I think you just fall into this complacency watching this, and if you delve into what they're actually saying for a split second like we're doing here, you realize the moronic crap that is coming out of their mouths. 
[00:28:30]  It's one of my favorite things we do on this show.  The buildings.  Beat the shit out of local news channels.  I think we also hate them more than most people do because of what we do, and them going after language.  We just develop such a fucking hatred for the press.  Most people don't even care.  They're like, eh, that's a short thing. 
[00:29:00]  But if they don't care, then why they can't hold on.  Actually, there was a particularly dangerous situation in areas like Minnesota and South Dakota where temperatures were a good 50 degrees below zero.  I don't believe it unless you show me.  But how much is the change here for the Northeast?  Put in perspective, yesterday in New York City at this time, it was 55 degrees.  What?  I don't remember that.  Right now, it is about 10 below.  So you're talking about a 60, 70 degree temperature change in less than 24 hours.  That is how quickly this air mass is going to be.  What would that do to, let's say, T-shirt?  You found something? 
[00:29:30]  Well, just in Minnesota.  What?  What's going on in Minnesota?  It's cold.  They're doing some fun cold weather experiments.  Ooh.  Let's see what they do.  They got on the rooftop with some fun demonstrations.  Hey, Rachel, what are you up to?  Hi, guys.  You know, it is so easy to complain about this bitter chill.  So I thought it's time to have a little fun.  This cold weather gives us the opportunity to do some experiments that you can do at home with your kids.  That only happen in sub-zero temperatures.  Oh, really?  First fun experiment is the wet shirt experiment. 
[00:30:00]  Put your shirt and put it in the sink.  Just get it wet.  All right.  She's demonstrating the whole process.  Get it wet there.  Get it wet.  She's explaining how you get a t-shirt wet.  Take a hanger.  Cool.  So we're outside right now where the temperature is about 5 below without windshield.  Wow.  Take that damp shirt, put it on the hanger.  I'll see it with a tank top this time.  And we'll be back in a little bit.  Cool.  Three minutes, 49 seconds, and I just want to see how this shirt's in.  Okay, yep, that's all it took.  What?  Wow.  That's one frozen t-shirt.  Well, look at that. 
[00:30:30]  Wow, she's hitting it on something.  Another fun experiment is to watch water crystallize.  Just take some near boiling water.  Near boiling water?  So you're outside.  All you do is throw it up in the air.  Let's see the wind blow right in our face.  Fun.  The last thing you can do is take some old bubble mix from the summer, blow a bubble.  Yeah?  Catch it, let it freeze, and then watch how you can break it.  Wow!  I don't fucking believe it.  Are we tards?  And the final experiment really speaks to how important it is to layer up. 
[00:31:00]  You have a peeled banana and an unpeeled banana.  This peel banana has been outside for about three minutes.  She's done this with penises, kind of deep-throated.  Rock hard.  The young people smell worse.  And it's cold, but if you bust open the peel, it's still squishy inside.  Pull back the foreskin, she means.  So, guys, think of this when you're wearing clothing and layering up.  Guys, nice.  The more clothing you have, the warmer you be on the inside.  Exposed skin freezes very quickly.  They're laughing.  Rock hard here.  Rock hard.  Remember the banana. 
[00:31:30]  That's right.  Remember the banana.  Thank you, Rachel.  You know it would be a great experiment if she put water on her clit and then took, like,  well, they would five minutes and then took a spatula and tried to make it shake and knock it off.  And her clit popped off.  That would be very painful, I bet.  Well, she said rock hard, though, the news.  Rock hard.  She gets points for that.  And they were laughing.  Today, some good news for school children here in Chicago.  Yet for another day, schools are closed here.  Minus nine in Chicago, huh?  Something that doesn't really happen here in Chicago, but again, the weather's just so cool. 
[00:32:00]  That's the call they made.  How cold is it?  Well, it was so cold.  What do you got there, Sam?  You got anything?  We've seen this one.  What?  Oh.  I can't believe so many experiments going on.  I like the bubble experiment.  That was kind of fun.  That was a good one, the bubble one.  Chris, it's about seven degrees here.  Every time the wind kicks up, it is absolutely brutal. 
[00:32:30]  Here in Atlanta, we know that there's an emergency shelter.  Wait, is that cold in Atlanta?  It's cold like that in Atlanta.  Now, that's something to talk about a lot, right?  Allowing people to come in and spend the night.  It's crazy.  That's where you got to go.  Fucking Atlanta.  Minnesota.  Okay.  You expect it.  You expect it's going to be cold.  Up here in the Northeast, you expect it to be in Atlanta.  Yeah, yeah.  Do your t-shirt experiment down in Atlanta.  You'll freak some people out.  They haven't seen shit like that.  Uh-oh. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, it's fantastic.  What is this dummy doing?  Yeah, more of the bubbles.  But anyone who plans to try this when it's warmer than, say, 20 or 30 degrees.  Ugh.  Jeannie Moe's.  Yuck.  We let her on the voyeur bus.  What idiots are we?  Oh, God.  Remember?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's more people just doing it.  Oh, he's a frozen t-shirt.  Wait, go back.  Frozen t-shirt.  She's actually making fun of this whole thing?  Yeah, we'll end with this. 
[00:33:30]  Start.  Start from wherever.  Okay, hit it.  The super soaker does sub-zero.  Go for it.  It's a little snowmaker.  But the most popular stupid weather trick this season seems to be the frozen wet t-shirt.  All right.  It took less than 10 minutes for it to completely freeze over here.  It only took six minutes.  Which we can now hold upside down because it is frozen solid.  That took two, three minutes.  And if frozen t-shirts leave you cold, how about a frozen banana?  Instead of a hammer or a frozen egg in Minnesota where it was 20 below, of course an egg freezes. 
[00:34:00]  It would be news if it didn't.  Thank you.  I guess I like her.  Or if it's egg on your face you prefer, show up on TV in a funny hat.  That is a serious piece of business and it looks good too.  Oh, I like it like that.  That's best like that, Kevin.  Now I may look like a bank robber tonight, Scott.  No.  Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was making fun of Southern California news anchors for freaking out when  temperatures dipped into the 50s and lower. 
[00:34:30]  Cold, cold, cold coming along.  I'm 53.  The extra blanket, the heater, the dog, anything you can do to keep warm, snuggled.  How long will this Arctic blast last?  Long enough for us to beat the frozen t-shirt into the ground.  It is solid.  I'll confirm.  It's frozen.  At least.  Somebody's picked up on it.  Looks like Mickey Mouse.  CNN.  Okay, there you go.  There we go.  Look at that, eh? 
[00:35:00]  Whoa!  New York.  That footprint is wonderful.  Okay.  Okay, that's it.  Pretty misty.  Yeah.  I'm glad somebody touched on it.  Very cool.  That's good.  God, they're terrible.  This is terrible.  It's unbelievable.  That's great.  Terrible.  Well, we got lots to do today.  Oh, yeah.  Don't we now?  Starting with eating.  Yeah, we're going to eat.  Listeners like to know that we're eating.  We got Dean Cain coming in today.  Superman?  Yep.  Superman will be here. 
[00:35:30]  And then we got to talk about Dennis Rodman.  Oh, yeah.  He's back in North Korea.  Right.  What other stuff?  What else do we have to talk about?  Because you said we're going to talk about it, Sam.  I did mention the Michael Bay thing.  Mm-hmm.  Dean Cain.  Oh, yeah.  Dean Cain, you know, he's running a Bigfoot show.  What?  So I said, you know, we got a news email, and one of the stories was a hunter who said that he'd captured a Bigfoot. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  We got that somewhere?  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  We have a video of the Bigfoot.  I don't think I have a video of Bigfoot to show you.  Now, why would you release a video if you killed a Bigfoot in the DNA test?  There's no reason to take one picture and release it.  That's good.  That's good.  Right.  Oh, that's him?  That's Bigfoot?  All right.  We'll do it after the break.  Stay there.  Mm-hmm.  Is it just his birthday?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  66 years old.  66.  66 WNBC years old.  We didn't talk about Bob Grant.  No.  Lost Bob Grant.  Bob Grant.  Yeah, he died over the little vacation we had.  He did our show once.  Yeah.  He liked us.  We liked him.  We liked Bob.  He was very outspoken.  One of the first real kind of conservative talkers. 
[00:37:00]  But, man, did he not give a fuck what he said.  It was great.  No.  He just said it.  I used to listen to him on the way to gigs in the afternoon, like 3 to 7, and listen to  him on the replay.  He did a nighttime replay on ABC.  It would be Jay Diamond, and then replay Bob Grant.  I want to say like 3 in the morning he would start replaying or whatever it was.  It was some weird replay hour, and I'd listen to Grant for hours every day.  It was great.  So much fun.  And that was during when New York was really a shithole.  He was perfect. 
[00:37:30]  He was the perfect guy.  The voice of New York.  Bashed the shit out of all these politicians.  But a guy like that wouldn't have survived on regular radio now.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't even, you know.  He let it out.  Yeah.  He came in the N.E.W., right?  Weren't they trying to get him or something?  Were they?  What happened?  And he was at Free FM for a little bit.  He was.  Maybe that's when we met him.  Mario.  Mario.  Oh, Mario Cuomo. 
[00:38:00]  Sentame.  Something, something.  Sfache.  I don't remember the past.  That's Sfacheem.  You Sfacheem.  Or Dinkins, the men's room attendant.  Yes.  How do you say that?  Say that.  Dinkins, the mayor of New York.  He called that men's room attendant.  Or the washroom attendant.  But he had to stop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But just that he said it was hilarious.  Hilarious.  And then we just cry over the littlest, dumbest thing a radio guy says.  Yeah.  He finally got in big trouble for...  Ron Brown.  Ron Brown. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, right.  Right in a plane crash.  Yeah.  Who was something about...  He was an advisor for...  Secretary of...  For who, though?  Which president again?  I'm going to guess Clinton.  Clinton.  Clinton, right.  Yeah, it was Clinton.  Okay.  He died in a plane crash.  I guess they hadn't found his body.  What was he, the Secretary of Commerce or something like that?  It was some...  I'm talking about Ron Brown.  Yeah, they hadn't found his body yet.  They hadn't found his body yet.  So they were speculating that he might still be alive.  And Bob said something like, but I'm an optimist. 
[00:39:00]  I think it was that they're saying...  He goes, you know, I'm saying maybe Ron Brown may be the only survivor.  Then again, I'm a pessimist.  A pessimist.  I think that was what he said.  Then again, I'm a pessimist.  Wow.  He was just, you know, pretty much saying he hoped he was dead.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  And Disney had taken over ABC, and they fucking canned him.  Yeah.  We have a...  Lautenberg, you'd call him Lousenberg.  Lousenberg.  Do we have any Bob Grant clips? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, we got one right here for everybody.  When he was on our show, I believe.  It's quick.  All right, now, before I do leave, I want to hear Anthony do his famous limitations.  All right.  Anthony with the famous Bob Grant.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  Get off my phone.  Forging ahead.  That was Jimmy.  That's so good.  It's scary because you could go around using that voice, saying things, and I'd get blamed. 
[00:40:00]  That was Jimmy.  Jay Diamond did a really good Bob Grant impression.  Yeah.  Jay Diamond did an amazing Bob Grant impression.  Bob was fucking...  Oh, he was hilarious.  We don't have any, like, nasty Bob Grant clips.  Get off my face.  He was just so cranky.  Yes.  Why don't you shut up?  Yeah.  Where's my...  I can't believe you said that.  Get me my digitalis.  He hated when they say, hey, Bob, how are you?  I'm fine. 
[00:40:30]  For the record to everyone, I'm fine.  You don't care.  If you find any good Bob Grant clips, let us know.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  So, there you go.  Bob Grant.  There was something we were going to talk about right after the break.  I forgot now.  It was a Bigfoot.  Bigfoot.  It was the Bigfoot thing?  Yeah.  Is that...  So, we found Bigfoot somewhere?  Yes.  So, what?  So, that means Dean Cain doesn't have to come in today?  I guess not.  Is he the host of the Bigfoot show?  Yes, he is.  And what's the Bigfoot show? 
[00:41:00]  It's a $10 million Bigfoot bounty.  It's called the Morning Mashup, and it's a...  Whoa.  She wears Uggs.  So, they're offering $10 million, if you could, like, prove without a doubt that there's a Bigfoot.  Yeah.  That's kind of a cool show.  $10 million?  Well, they went with $10 million, because they know it's not going to happen.  They know it's impossible.  And they need the evidence to be irrefutable.  Irrefutable.  How are they going to do that?  Well, that picture proves it.  I mean, if you had the only Bigfoot, you would take just a close-up on part of the face. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Why would you have video?  It'd be so stupid.  Why?  You'd want one picture close-up on the face.  Yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't want the whole body.  You wouldn't want multiple pictures.  No.  You wouldn't want your camera going...  Not at all.  You would take so many pictures.  Oh, my God.  With multiple cameras, just in case you lost your camera.  Exactly.  But what?  We got one picture, huh?  What is this?  A video?  Mm-hmm.  All right, let's hear this.  A video of the one picture?  Nearly a year ago, we introduced you to a man who claimed was shot and killed Bigfoot in San Antonio. 
[00:42:00]  The alleged incident was featured in a documentary that left more questions than answers.  Did it?  Of course it did.  Today, the Bigfoot hunter is finally releasing pictures of the creature's body.  Why wouldn't he release them right away?  Because he's full of shit.  Right.  Right.  Bigfoot is 100% real.  There's no question about that.  Rick Dyer has been saying that for well over a year now, claiming he shot and killed one  of the mythical creatures in these woods on the northwest side in September 2012. 
[00:42:30]  Until today, he's never provided any proof beyond this grainy video clip.  I have been worried for so long.  I have been put off for so long.  Pause.  He's been put off for so long.  Yeah, because you're not giving anyone anything.  You wouldn't be put off if you walked into a news building and had Bigfoot.  And throw Bigfoot's head at the anchor's feet.  Or true scientists would go crazy.  They'd say he might have found the missing link.  Right.  If you find a Bigfoot, a creature that we haven't identified, it's no longer mythical. 
[00:43:00]  It's an actual thing.  Right.  You're not going to be laughed at.  I'm sure there was a time elephants were...  Oh, yes.  So scary.  Yeah.  I'll go back slightly, but he can't believe no one is taking it seriously.  Yeah.  Because he's giving nothing.  Right.  La-dee-dee.  Washington and Gashabadi.  This is a picture of the alleged Bigfoot.  Oh.  It is the real deal. 
[00:43:30]  It's Bigfoot.  And Bigfoot's here.  And I shot and killed it.  And now I'm proving it to the world.  Nose is cracking off.  Dyer says the body has gone through extensive testing to prove it's real.  He's also showed it to several people.  Oh, my gosh.  Sure.  Why a reporter?  Make them believers.  And we did it to over 130 people.  We definitely made them believers.  Despite a history of past Bigfoot hoaxes, Dyer insists he's not fooling around this time.  Bigfoot's not a tooth fairy. 
[00:44:00]  Bigfoot is real.  Dyer tells me he plans to have a news conference in the coming days where he will show the full body and reveal all the test results.  Personally, I'm still skeptical, but we want to know what you think.  Go to our Facebook page and let us know if you think this is the real deal.  Utter nonsense.  Just another fake.  But why does the news guy, I know we sound like a broken record, but why does he only come up with, I'm skeptical.  Why wouldn't you be the guy, go, he's full of shit.  What's nonsense.  He's a load of shit.  And explain why he's full of shit with the evidence he's released. 
[00:44:30]  His cracked off nose.  Showing a 10-year-old and we're supposed to go, oh, wow, okay.  iPhone videos.  How about a fucking news camera and scientists?  Right.  Exactly.  He proved it to this kid from Minnesota.  Right.  It sure looked big to me.  Right.  The same dummies that get excited when they see a frozen t-shirt on the news.  Exactly.  That kid still thinks there's Santa.  Right.  He's showing him.  Exactly.  But I'm more bothered by the news people.  I'm a bit skeptical. 
[00:45:00]  We want to hear from you.  Go to our website.  A bit skeptical?  That's what he said.  That's it?  A bit skeptical.  Yeah.  So Dean Cain's got the show, though.  Does he have the show about this?  Like this is one of the guys on it?  No, I doubt it.  I don't think he is.  No.  No.  Nine determined teams of very colorful characters.  Nine teams.  Nine.  Nine.  Wow.  Nine determined teams go out and hunt for Bigfoot. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  Can you kill him, or do you just got to capture him alive?  You can kill him.  They need to have the actual creature or obtain DNA and photographic evidence.  When's the show premiering?  This Friday.  Okay.  All right.  We'd like to thank Dean Cain for coming in.  We don't need Dean Cain, and I'll tell you why.  I'm going to blow up Dean Cain's spot right now.  Sheesh.  If the show's premiering Friday, that means the show has been filmed.  Ah.  And if somebody did get Bigfoot, there's no way they'd be able to hold back that info 
[00:46:00]  until the final episode of his Bigfoot show.  You don't think they kept it secret?  The Bigfoot?  Now, I want to know, is that what he's doing?  Like, is it shot that way, or is it some kind of a progressive, almost reality show that  they kind of show as it's happening?  Good question.  What do you think?  What does it say on our sheet?  I don't think it says...  It says $10 million. 
[00:46:30]  I think that with reality TV the way it is, I'm going to guess they're shooting as they  go.  Wow.  They're editing from week to week, I'm going to guess.  Oh.  Then, all right.  Then it makes it a little more...  Like a Survivor or something like that.  Oh, no, Survivor's all shot at once, though, isn't it?  Yes.  Oh, God, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But isn't there a grand finale?  There's some live finale.  Then they do the live finale.  Where they tell you who actually won.  Well, before we put the hammer down on Dean Cain, we will also say he's a strong advocate  of gun rights. 
[00:47:00]  Ah.  Yeah, he's conservative.  I've done red-eye with him.  He's a fairly conservative guy.  Yeah, we'll have a good time with Dean Cain.  And I think he was on once before, I think.  Was he on?  I think he was.  Not since I've been here.  And that was a long time.  I think he was on.  I don't know if he ever was, to be honest.  I think he was on back then.  Oh, you know when?  When we took a trip, because I met him once, and this was when we went to, you played poker.  That poker trip.  Ah, the poker trip.  That was, I met Dean Cain that weekend. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know if he was on our show or if we just met him and spoke to him.  I think he sat down with us for a little while.  Yeah?  He was a boar.  Oh, shit.  Well, he's got this Bigfoot thing to talk about.  I think he's going to be great.  He's got this Bigfoot thing.  Looking forward to seeing Dean Cain a little later on the show.  And he doesn't have much time with us.  No?  That's what I'm reading.  He's got to go to...  No, don't do it that way, Jimmy.  He's got to go to the Today Show.  So he's, you know...  In and out.  He's working it.  We like that.  We like the in and outs. 
[00:48:00]  He is a work in it.  All right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I watched...  I got to tell you about this show I watched yesterday.  It's a new talk show.  It's so different from all the other shows.  You know, the Jerry Springer thing and Maury.  Sure.  And all these paternity shows and everything.  It's search.  S-E-R-C-H.  Why no A?  Because his name is Search. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  MC Search.  You...  What?  That's kind of clever.  That's him.  I got to say that's kind of...  MC Search.  You might recognize him.  Kind of clever.  From Ace of Base.  What?  I was wondering what happened with that guy.  Yes.  Yeah.  This was some of the most cringe-inducing television.  He's talking like...  He's got the wigger kind of cadence when he's talking.  The intro to the show, I almost had an embarrassment attack. 
[00:49:00]  Where's this show?  It's on WPIX, Channel 11 in New York.  Some other cities are running it at 4 o'clock.  And what is he searching for?  Well, that's just it.  His name is DJ Search.  Right.  MC Search.  Right.  But he also, it's kind of a double meaning, because he's searching for the truth and to  help people.  That's right.  He's there to help.  You know why?  Because he came from the streets, yo.  That's right.  He did.  He came from the streets.  And he's, in his own words, keeping it real. 
[00:49:30]  Nice.  Bad time somebody did.  If there's one statement that means nothing, it's keeping it real.  I keep it real.  What does that mean?  What does it even mean?  You're keeping it real.  I don't know.  But he is...  Do you think that's overused?  Oh, my God.  And he had some baby mamas on yesterday with this guy who apparently fathered quite a few 
[00:50:00]  through these very rotund white women.  And for some reason, he wasn't paying child support or taking care of his kids.  And he said that he was.  And there was Search yelling at them, by the way, saying, don't you use words like that,  because they were calling each other, you know, bitch and stuff.  He goes, not on this show.  In this show, we're finding solutions. 
[00:50:30]  There you go.  I like this guy.  But I thought he said he was keeping it real.  Shouldn't they be able to use real language?  I don't know what keeping it real is.  So it might be, you know, hey, it's my show.  Are you allowed to say yo, bitch, if you're keeping it real or not?  Yo, bitch.  I hope not.  So what are we going to see?  I hope we see something.  Is this the trailer?  Just a quick trailer.  All right.  Let's see.  But this gives you a little background on Search, just in case you forgot, from the 80s.  I grew up hanging out on the streets.  I've seen the good and the bad. 
[00:51:00]  The bad, they show graffiti.  With gold records and world toll.  Then hit the radio as a DJ and helped real people solve real problems.  My family is my world.  And I believe all worlds.  It's really fad now, huh?  Yeah.  I know what's wrong.  And I will let you know the difference.  You're keeping it real with a salad.  Yeah.  Search, and I'm coming to daytime television.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm keeping it real.  This guy's good.  That was it.  And he's white.  I want to hear more. 
[00:51:30]  But he grew up in the streets, yo.  Grew up in the streets.  And they show the buildings with, like, fire escapes.  Like, oh, look out.  Look out.  He had some fucking hard-hitting raps.  Oh, that she wants.  Is that Ace of Base?  No, he was in Third Base.  Oh, Third Base.  Oh, I thought it was Ace of Base.  Okay.  Wait, Third Base.  I don't know which one was Third Base.  Third Base was the rap group.  They had one song, I think.  What did they sing?  Yeah.  What do you mean he had world tours?  By the way, this is why my entire management team is being fired. 
[00:52:00]  He has a talk show.  Oh, shit.  Right?  I can't get mine done.  How did he get one?  Because he knows how to keep it real.  Yeah, Jim.  You're not keeping it real.  No, but I want to just have fun, guys.  Yeah.  Is this Pop Goes the Weasel?  But the weasel goes pop.  Oh.  Mm.  I think the one Eric told me to play is just a rejoiner.  Oh, Christ almighty.  E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock keeps it real.  He does.  He could have a talk show. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you know one of his solo songs from when he left Third Base?  He left Third Base?  A little bit of this guy.  Yeah, he's on some world tours.  He said world tours.  He wasn't on a world tour for him.  World tour.  He was dragged along with some other people that had to beef up their fucking show.  He had two hit singles.  Oh, shit.  Which ones?  Here It Comes and Back to the Grill.  Back to the Grill.  Back to the Grill.  Back to the Grill, I actually know. 
[00:53:00]  No.  Yeah.  There's no way you know it.  Is this him as a solo artist?  Yes, it is.  Back to the Grill again.  The Grill again.  Back to the Grill again.  The Grill again.  Boo!  Back to the Grill again.  Back to the Grill again.  The Grill again.  Back to the Grill again.  The Grill again.  Back to the Grill again.  Search will never stand still.  You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this.  And you're more optimistic than the sounds of blackness.  Flip raps are ripped through the chest cavity.  And I keep going and going just like an energizer battery.  Wow.  This is just real old-school rap. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, it's old.  If I've heard worse, it's just, what year it is, I'm going to get this.  This sounds like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air shit, right?  92.  92.  92?  It does sound like Fresh Prince, yeah.  That was all style back then.  That was the era.  All right, he was no big music fucking star.  Oh, is this another one?  He's not terrible, though.  All right, I got the full episode.  Oh, okay, get the beginning.  Right at the beginning, his little talk about what this is going to be about.  Well, yeah.  Because he's going to tell you.  All right.  Make it big, Sam.  Damn it, I want to see Search.  My name is Search.  Hi. 
[00:54:00]  I grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens, in New York.  Raised by my parents, but later grew up in the streets.  What?  Pause.  You can't be raised by your parents.  He was raised by his parents.  That's not how it works.  You can't be raised by your parents and then fucking grow up.  He wants to sound tough, but he doesn't want to insult his parents.  Is he some just dumb Jewish kid that had a nice upbringing?  What is he talking about?  I went to Yale for my undergraduate.  Right.  I got a doctorate at the School of Hard Docs.  Damn, you're right.  And stop talking like that. 
[00:54:30]  You're a middle-aged man.  I know.  He's a middle-aged white guy, and he's talking like...  He doesn't talk like that when he's just hanging out, you know, off camera.  He goes back and forth through the show, depending on who he's talking to and what he's saying.  Like he's like, he's like, look, we need to do that.  And they're just like, yeah, keeping a rare.  Hold on, guys.  Oh.  Some are getting creative.  Oh, it's Jenny Moss again.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I thought they were doing more little tricks.  Experiments.  What does he look like?  What is he reminding me of?  Like the Faye, he's walking.  I'm like, that guy looks really familiar. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know who.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  I'm ringing a bell.  But he's keeping a rare.  Probably nobody famous.  But he actually said, raise my parents and then the streets.  You can't do that.  Yo, I had to sling exams when I was going for my LSAT, son.  Right.  Boo.  I bet you had a really nice upbringing.  Yeah.  Lovely parents.  Yo.  All right.  Tell me about instinct, survival, and finding hope when all you saw was hopelessness. 
[00:55:30]  My family instilled in me values like have integrity over everything.  Help others even when you can't help yourself and always, always keep it real.  That helped me survive when I started my rap career.  That's right.  They called me Search because I was always looking for the answers.  Oh, God.  I'm going to do the show because I want to help people sort out through their conflict  and get back on their grind in a better state of mind.  You feel me?  Yep.  Let's get it popping.  Yes, let's.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  This guy's good. 
[00:56:00]  Let's get it popping.  Wow.  And he walks right into the studio audience.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's right there.  It's so forced.  Oh, my God.  I thought it was Reach.  I thought it was Reach.  The other day, I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to watch Reach.  Reach.  And then I was informed that if it was true without the A, it would be Wretch.  It would be Wretch.  So I was like, oh, it was Search, right, without the A. 
[00:56:30]  DJ Dempsey, whatever the fuck.  MC Search.  He explained why they called him Search.  Why not spell it correctly?  Yeah.  Looking for the truth.  Yeah, he's looking for the truth.  He should look for a dictionary.  Maybe that's what he should look for.  They used to call me.  He's still looking for the A.  He's still searching for the A.  He's going to find the fucking A.  Let's hear a little more of him.  Are you sure?  Set up the show.  You sure?  Oh, yeah.  You can tell he's from the streets, the way he's high-fiving all these white women. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Right.  And he has sneakers on.  This guy keeps it real.  Oh, he does.  Well, he said he does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to keep it real.  One guy, four women, and six kids.  I don't think he wants to be a dad.  I've been through hell.  I've been through back.  Who's telling the truth?  I've been through back.  He says, yeah, yeah.  That guy is a moron.  How does a 10-child have a relationship?  19?  I'm not happy.  Could you pause it for a second?  Wait, so he's keeping it real by doing a Maury Povich show.  Maury show.  But he yells at the people for saying, like, bitch. 
[00:57:30]  That's his angle.  Like, I don't like that shit.  No, I don't like that.  Respect your women.  That's what he said.  And the crowd claps.  You saw this?  No, I didn't.  But this is what I'm hoping for.  That's exactly what happened.  It's about time.  You saw this.  That one guy is the biggest dolt.  The guy sitting up on the panel.  So you saw this actual episode.  Yeah, I saw this episode.  The one who said, I've been through hell.  I've been through back.  Yeah, because he must have heard, I've been through hell and back.  Yeah.  And you think maybe he's just nervous.  He said it twice in the episode. 
[00:58:00]  He also said, he's got a daughter.  I have a 14-year-month-old daughter.  That's right.  A 14-year-month-old daughter.  That's right.  He said.  All right.  He's an idiot.  What's wrong with that?  Well, he's an idiot.  Yes.  And he's kept getting up and getting in the faces of the women.  So Search had to sit him down and go like, hey, you never get in a woman's face.  Woo!  And the audience goes crazy.  That's right.  And it goes on and on and on.  I like that. 
[00:58:30]  Until the end where he wraps it up with his Search is 60.  60 seconds where he kind of keeps it real.  That's good.  That's what you need.  So he got that move from Springer.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember Springer would wrap it up all nice again?  Final thoughts.  Final thoughts.  If you want to, you know, there's really.  Just give us a taste of this because what?  It's an hour long?  It was.  At least push play here.  Let's see where we're at.  It's all right now on Search.  Right now.  Oh, he's going into the subway because he's keeping it real. 
[00:59:00]  Feel like I've seen it all.  By the way, the show is obviously filmed in Connecticut where they film every.  You can't take a subway to Connecticut.  They film all those talk shows in Connecticut.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yo, I look like Darth Vader when the helmet came off, yo.  Go to the intro because I got to hear him.  Yeah, yeah.  Go back a little because.  I want to hear the intro where he's just keeping it real on the street.  He's in the streets.  He's talking about himself again.  135th Street.  135th.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Hanging out on the streets of New York.  Hey, what's up?  Feel like I've seen it all.  The good and the bad.  Graffiti.  I don't want to be out here at night.  Became a hip-hop star.  Go records and world tours.  God, no.  That was a great time.  Then hit the radio in Detroit and help real people solve real problems.  My kids and my wife are my world.  Maddo Black.  And I believe all world can do better.  I know what's right.  I know what's wrong.  And I will let you know the difference. 
[01:00:00]  Whoa.  Thank you.  My name's Search.  My name's Search.  Oh, man.  He's high-fiving the very diverse audience.  High-fives as he opens up his show and tells people to keep it real.  Sit down.  You're going to get tired.  All right.  Get it?  Hilarious.  So, we have a very interesting situation.  Anybody have kids?  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:00:30]  How about this?  We got women here that have one thing in common.  Yeah.  They got babies with one man.  Three women, one dad.  Check this out.  That's a what?  So, the baby mamas won't let me see my sons because they think that I'm not a father.  How baby mama is even a thing that is said outside of a housing project?  How it became something that's even said in the news, on TV shows, in front of a civilized nation?  Baby mama? 
[01:01:00]  Enough!  Thank you.  More search.  The baby daddy.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  That I'm good enough for my kids.  I don't want David to see my son because he's not stable.  Oh, boy.  He bounces back and forth from job to job.  I'm 22 years old and I have six kids but four different women.  He loves what?  Fat white women.  What?  Yeah.  He's got a fucking potent cock.  He's 22.  Yeah.  Six kids with four.  Well, you missed the point where, well, later on. 
[01:01:30]  I thought the opster put up some numbers.  Whoa!  Later on, search tells him, why didn't you use a rubber, B?  B?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Has the search ever used a condom?  I don't know.  That would answer your question because they're terrible, search.  Why would you want so many fucking kids by the time you're 22 with four different...  I don't get that.  You're assuming any thought is being put into any future consequence or anything aside 
[01:02:00]  from how it feels at the moment.  You know, somebody said it, search looks like Joe DeRosa.  Oh, shit.  That's who it looks like.  Dumb glasses.  Chubby Joe DeRosa.  Yes.  Yeah.  How we're hoping Joe DeRosa will look like eventually.  Search.  All right.  He's searching for his shoulders.  22.  He doesn't have it.  Six kids.  Four women.  Yeah.  So that means he started 15, 16...  Oh, no. 
[01:02:30]  I guess he could have...  Go ahead.  Yeah.  He just banged them all.  At the same time, possibly, too.  All right.  Go ahead.  He loves a chubby white woman.  And I have six kids, but four different women.  David's around when he wants to be around.  That's pretty much it.  I try to keep in contact with him.  Well, what were you expecting?  You stupid bitch.  Right.  They don't want me around.  Oh.  Wasn't keeping a peg.  Sorry.  You respect these women.  David has not tried to get in contact with his kids as much as he did not.  And you're surprised by this.  Does your dad try to get in touch with you anymore? 
[01:03:00]  I bet not.  I want David to come to my house to see...  What?  ...our son, but he refuses to, so that's why he don't see him.  David's just basically playing us all as he wants to be.  Big fat pigs.  Yes.  The next minute, they don't want me around.  I don't know what it is.  I'm just trying to be your father to my kids.  That's right.  I want to welcome Kim, Danielle, and Alicia to the show.  Thank you so much for being here.  See, now he just talks like a regular guy.  I want to welcome...  Tell me, what is the problem with David? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  No problem, David.  None.  None.  Lie.  That ain't no lie.  You won't let him.  That's where you're...  Whoa!  Wait, what's going on?  Yep, because, okay.  The fat one on the right is with him now and has a kid with him.  The fat ones in the middle and the fat one on the...  They have kids with him, but don't let him see a son because he doesn't pay no bills, yo.  Oh, Bob, why ain't he paying child support?  Exactly.  He is.  That's right.  No, he ain't. 
[01:04:00]  The hell he ain't.  Fat, white, bitches.  I don't have a card.  Bitch, it goes into my bank account, and I can tell you every single damn thing.  Oh, Search, get in now, Search.  Control your show.  Why is she wearing an inner tube?  She has an inner tube around her belly, doesn't she?  Yes.  She's a worthless piece of crap.  Because it should be the fuck.  Whoa!  I'm going to travel to...  Is this keeping it real?  You're only going to see this on Search's show.  That's true.  This is a very unique show.  So glad he's coming up with something brand new for daytime TV. 
[01:04:30]  This is the set.  If you turn this on without the Search logo...  You would swear it's Jerry Springer with a new set.  Springer or fucking Maury.  Or even the other one with that guy you did the show with there.  Fucking paternity show.  What did I do?  Oh, the test.  Oh, Kirk Fox.  The test.  Yeah.  It's all the same.  Kirk Fox actually is entertaining.  But the show is the same fucking thing.  It's yelling people.  Yelling about their kids.  And who's the daddy.  And all this happy horse shit. 
[01:05:00]  Terrible.  I mean, this just goes on and on.  Let's keep going.  I mean, Search.  You need a little Search.  To the end where we get to hear...  No, I want to hear Search jump in at least.  Yeah, yeah.  Hear a little House Search.  And then we can move on.  Yeah, he was.  Because we know how this ends.  Okay, let's break this down for a second.  Uh-oh, he's going to break it down.  When was the last time David saw his kids?  Last time David saw my son will be a year in March.  Oh, man. 
[01:05:30]  And just so we know, David is backstage.  He's going to come out in a little bit.  Oh, that never happens.  Look, a backstage camera.  So, well, the last time he came around, he wanted me to provide a way to his house, leave  my son, and go get him when I could not afford it.  Now that's showing a picture of the poor little kid.  I'm going to play that right now because she came to my house for a week on her son's birthday.  That's when I lived in Bryan.  No, you didn't.  You lived in Melville. 
[01:06:00]  That's when you lived in Bryan.  Right.  And that's the only time that you threw a fit because David wanted to wrestle with you.  You wanted me to take him to West Unity when you lived in West Unity.  What kind of inane conversation is this?  He did have a car.  Yeah, he did have a car.  He came there plenty of times and stayed at your house.  Shouldn't this have been edited out?  No, this is good stuff.  Where did you live?  Right.  Who came over?  Towns we don't know about.  Towns who gives a shit.  You went to Krauser's for coffee, yo.  This is keeping it real. 
[01:06:30]  A search.  I feel like search just stands there until somebody in his ear says, ask him to repeat that.  Right.  Ah, search.  Search, wake the fuck up.  You said something in five minutes, you idiot.  Letting these fucking boring bitches babble on and on.  Right.  These cows are taking over, search.  Oh, fuck.  We're in trouble.  Oh, search.  Search isn't even listening.  Search probably ends the show way too early so they can't edit anything out.  No, they can't.  I think you're right.  Holy shit, search.  Let's see when search pops in. 
[01:07:00]  I think he does.  Yeah.  I think he gives some.  He's maybe seen him 15 times.  Why would you lie to your man, supposedly your man, that you have no issues for the relationship.  Perfect as hell.  Be with one of his other baby mommies for a night or longer than a night.  Why?  Because I trust him.  He needs to be a part of his kids.  Bullshit.  Trust him.  Is that why he was trying to get with me?  Oh, shit.  When I was still in school.  He wants to get with me.  Do you like her?  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Fall back.  Hold on.  Fall back.  Say that again, please.  Fall back.  Fall back.  When I moved back to Indiana in 2012, 2011, David was trying to hook up with me again. 
[01:07:30]  The bad part is she don't know I give him permission to.  What?  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right.  Church is going to get into this.  No, no, no.  He's addicted.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Have respect for yourself, girl.  Please.  No, no.  Please.  Yeah, addicted to having a kid.  Are y'all following this?  Is anybody?  Y'all following.  This should be called white people embarrassing themselves.  Why is he talking like that?  Why would you give a man permission to be with another woman? 
[01:08:00]  He had sex with another woman because he has an addiction.  Oh.  He's addicted to cows.  And what does that mean?  So, Kim, let's think about this.  So, let me, let's think about it this way.  Hold on.  Fall back.  I'm going to let you speak.  Fall back.  So, you let him have sex because he has an addiction.  Step off.  So, if he was a crack addict, you would give him crack because he had an addiction.  Oh, shit.  Good example, Serge.  That's why Serge is the host.  That's why Serge is the host.  He held back to throw that out there.  A lot of people wouldn't keep it that real.  I want to go back to this.  He keeps it real. 
[01:08:30]  Do you realize that he's trying to have more than just emotional contact with his kids?  These women are obviously saying that he's making passes at them beyond just wanting to see them.  Way to keep it straight.  Passes.  He's trying some heavy petting.  He just called me over the summer.  Oh, shit.  Now what are you going to do?  Now, hold on.  Just so we're clear.  Uh-oh.  Here.  Okay.  Just so we're clear.  Yeah.  Clear?  Don't call anybody out their name.  She ain't calling out your name.  Don't call anybody out their name.  I'm not having none of that.  Oh, she's done calling me a bitch.  She's done calling me a hoe and all this. 
[01:09:00]  But not on this stage.  And not here.  That's right.  What if people at home call you a fat white cunt?  Not here.  When he tried to get with you this summer, what happened?  Good for him.  You don't want them calling each other bitch.  She's trying to say he's not had contact with me?  Because he doesn't understand the topic at hand.  Well, he really cares about these women respecting each other.  He's right.  He's right.  It's not like it's people talking about Obamacare.  I'm going to take myself from him.  Okay?  You don't pay your child support for once.  What?  And you're far behind.  Way far behind. 
[01:09:30]  Uh-huh.  And on top of that, I'm not going to let my kid around someone that's irresponsible.  Really?  I'm irresponsible.  How about you?  The man can't hold a job.  The man hasn't supplied anything for his kid from day one.  Oh, shit.  You don't let him.  No, he don't need to be around my kid.  He is irresponsible.  No, hell he ain't.  I got three kids by this man.  He's a wonderful dad.  And they only have custody of what Obamacare is.  You know what?  I want to kind of...  Scott, can you pull up the tree, please?  I want to point out the tree.  Oh, no.  What's the tree?  Okay, so here's the tree.  So we have Alicia, who has son Xavier. 
[01:10:00]  And he hasn't seen Xavier in how long?  It'll be a year in March.  A year in March.  Then we have Danielle, who has Dante.  And how long has it been?  Over a year.  Spell it right.  And then Kim has Melody, Ariana, and Harmony.  And you guys are together.  And there's a fourth baby mama.  Dante, D-A-N-T.  D-A-N-T, who has a son, and they're not here.  A fourth baby mama.  I really need to know from you, Kim,  how do you put up with this behavior?  Because I love the man.  He has a great dad.  That's right. 
[01:10:30]  That's sweet.  That's nice.  That's my oldest Melody.  She's adorable.  Oh, shut up.  He flies the diapers, butt wipes, plays with them.  Xavier buys the diapers once.  He's on his own free will.  Why should he support your guys' kids  when you don't let them see it?  You guys want to meet David?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What if no one clapped?  Would they not bring him out?  We're going to meet David right after the break.  Oh, shit.  It's going to make us wait.  Way to keep it real.  It's going to make us wait.  We've got to meet David, and then we can move on.  Damn it.  I'm dying to hear David.  Here he is. 
[01:11:00]  Man to man.  Why didn't you wear a rubber, babe?  You can't tell me that you don't like the feel of it  without a condom on.  A hundred percent.  And the baby mama's unloaded.  You had four women pregnant at once.  No.  You played us all.  No.  Four.  Stop doing it.  And later.  Oh, we can keep married as long as I have another child.  How does a tenth child help a relationship?  Nineteen?  What's the difference?  I'm not having another baby.  Wow.  Wow.  Really putting your foot down after having nine kids. 
[01:11:30]  It's crazy.  It's just crazy.  Let's meet David.  No, we'll go to the end with the search 60.  We're here with Alicia, Danielle, Kim, and now David.  David, welcome to the show.  Thank you for having me.  David, man, walk me through this, man.  How did this all start?  First off, this all started with Alicia.  Now he's talking to a black guy, so he really has to wig it up.  I just lost my virginity.  The age of 17, you know what I'm saying?  So technically.  Not by me?  Not by you.  You're right, not by you.  I'm glad it wasn't by you.  Me too.  Oh, shit, yo. 
[01:12:00]  You know, I'm young.  I was about, I just turned 18.  So first time, you know, as soon as I did it, now I'm out, you know, just trying to find whatever.  You know, I didn't care because I wanted to do it again.  It was fun the first time.  His fat thighs, dude.  When did the new pregnancy happen?  Certainly does.  A few months down the road.  It's like CeeLo.  I don't know when.  Thank you.  Okay.  So then, when do you meet Danielle?  The first time.  I was actually over at a friend's house.  And she wanted to, you know, get it in.  I don't know if it was the first time with a black man or what. 
[01:12:30]  No, not even.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, I'm proud.  We were talking about it.  Done shots from our father's room.  And I had a friend take me over there.  She snuck me in.  She snuck me in through her basement window.  Oh, boy.  She gave me a condom.  We got it on.  And as soon as I got done, she snuck me out.  I got pregnant.  Where does Kim fall into place with all of this?  I was dating somebody.  And at the time, that relationship didn't work out.  I ended up meeting Kim.  And I ended up getting with Kim.  And then the three kids came after their two kids? 
[01:13:00]  No.  No.  He's got a daughter in between our two boys.  No.  Two months younger than her son.  None of this.  It goes, her boy.  Yes.  My daughter.  My son.  Right.  Then there are other kids and the other child that's not you.  She right.  She right.  She right.  She right.  I got to ask you this, man.  Like, why didn't you wear a rubber, B?  Like, why didn't you wear a rubber, B?  B?  B?  Why didn't you wear a rubber, B?  Is that lying?  Why are you guys saying?  Uh-huh, B?  Are some real s***? 
[01:13:30]  On some real stuff.  Right now.  On some real.  I like the feel of it bad.  I did wear a rubber, you know what I'm saying?  He's right.  But being a young kid, being a young kid, I don't care.  I don't care what no man say in here.  I don't care what anybody say.  You can't tell me that you don't like the feel of it without a condom.  Fog, yeah.  See, again, the instant gratification, the complete lack of understanding.  I'm young.  I was only like 18 years old.  What's wrong with it?  The B.S. meter going on.  What's wrong with it?  The B.S. meter.  The B.S.  B.S.  Oh, B.S. 
[01:14:00]  I want to do it without a condom on.  Can I get a mic, Tom?  Can I get a mic?  No, no, no, no.  Check this out.  Yo, check this out.  Hold on now.  Who's Search talking to?  Search.  Search.  Now, with Danielle, Danielle supplied me a condom.  No, I did not.  Yes, you did.  No, I did not.  We did not.  Yes, you did.  It was a magnum, and I put it in your trash can.  No, you did not.  Because you didn't need it.  You were the second person I've ever had sex with.  No, you supplied me.  Oh, God.  No, I did not.  But you know what?  Why again?  It doesn't matter because a baby's here. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  Oh, wow.  Search.  Yeah, he brings it back.  Search keeps it real.  He's always on point.  He just kept it real.  Yeah.  Let's stand up.  What's your name?  Denise.  Denise, where are you from?  Philly.  Philly?  She looks like Jodie Foster.  She wasn't an actress, but just a fat old lady.  Because you didn't want to have a condom, and like the feel without a condom, it wasn't  fair to these children that you brought in, fair to these women.  She's right.  It's not fair.  Don't give me a question.  Stop being selfish.  Stop being pretty selfish. 
[01:15:00]  And these kids don't deserve it.  And I don't think these kids, they don't deserve you as a father if you can do all this.  What?  Can you pause real quick?  Isn't it the other way?  Here's the thing.  She's so bad at this, she can't even get an applause break from a guy who has fucking  six kids from four women.  This fucking pig can't get an applause from these cows in the audience.  She says they don't deserve you as a father.  It should be the other way.  She's dumb.  She can't word it properly. 
[01:15:30]  She's trying so hard to hit that emotional home run, and she's just flailing at foul balls.  She's getting dribs and drabs of applause.  Search is loving it, though, man.  Search is digging her, because Search actually reiterates a little of what she said.  Search one of the microphones for her, too.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's hear a little search.  You're here for your kids?  You're here for three kids.  What about the other two?  What about the other two?  Why don't you tell them to let David be a part of their life?  I do want David to be a part of...  Because I like to have fun at that age.  I want David in my territory.  I'm not a good father for my kids.  Do you have a job, though?  Do you have a job? 
[01:16:00]  You're not.  When she got pregnant.  Do you have a job?  Yes, I have a job.  Okay, she says you buy diapers.  Do you buy diapers for them?  I don't get to see my job.  She's a nice boy.  Diapers.  Diapers.  You buy diapers.  You buy diapers.  I pay the top support.  They're your children.  You take care of your children.  This is good TV.  Don't take care of three and forget the other two.  It's terrible.  David, are you hearing what this woman's saying?  You can fight with them back at home.  Listen to what she's saying, because she's kicking some real things to you. 
[01:16:30]  These are your children.  She's kicking some real things to you.  She is.  Who talks like that?  People from the street.  She's kicking some real things to you.  It's like kicking fucking things.  They're real.  We kick game on this show.  G-A-M-E.  Grown-ass man education.  That's what we do.  Oh, shit.  Did he just say that?  Is he trying to make something?  Yes.  Kicking game.  We're kicking game.  I bet you that's a failed fucking rap song. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I betcha.  Trying to educate some grown-ass men.  Yeah.  I like this.  There's some education going on.  Yeah.  What do we do now?  The way he's trying to be so street, but it's 1988.  It is?  It's just terrible.  Kicking game.  Grown-ass man education. 
[01:17:30]  Grown-ass man education.  He's kicking game.  Yo.  Yeah.  Fuck his ass.  Throw a couple of yo's in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep going.  Regardless of all of this, this happened, that happened.  The end result is our future generation is in your hands.  Oh, shit.  Your hands, your hands, and your hands.  Right.  That's a really original thought, too.  Right.  This guy's good.  What this woman says is very true.  Oh.  If you are in a situation. 
[01:18:00]  You buy diapers?  You buy diapers?  You buy diapers?  And there is time between seeing the kids and all of that.  He sounds like Scott Shannon.  It is your job as a man to ship.  What?  To send to Western Union to do whatever you have to do to provide for your children.  That's all I'm saying.  He's right.  Now, let me say something.  Let me say something.  To support them, but don't get to see them so the kids grow up without an end.  No.  You're crazy. 
[01:18:30]  You're crazy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Check this out.  No.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Check this out.  That's pretty fast.  That's good.  I'm saying I'm not supporting my kids.  All right?  I made a $243 check.  That whole check got taken.  Whoa.  That's supporting my kids.  But you know what?  I still got a 14-month-year-old home that I have to support.  You know what I'm saying?  You can support your boys.  He can support you.  I give the money.  I give the money.  I give money.  Money's given.  How is it you can support the girls but not the boys?  I would like to know this.  You support the boys. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, shit.  Then where did $243 go?  Not to me.  I can tell you that.  I've received my last $243.  He makes $243.  Can you stop this?  Yes, yes.  He's claiming what a great daddy is to his multitude of children.  I could have lived like this?  He makes $240.  I could have lived like this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But does I have something called responsibility?  Right.  You have six kids with four women and you make $243 a week?  There's zero responsibility here.  Oh, my God.  This is not some anomaly. 
[01:19:30]  This is a 70% to 75% problem.  By the way, search does come from the streets.  Oh, yeah?  He's from far Rockaway, Queens.  He was of Jewish descent, and he graduated from music and art high school.  The fame school?  Nothing says the school of hard knocks.  Yes.  Like the music and art high school.  Like dancing on the tables.  Fame, I want to live forever.  I had to sing Hot Lunch, yo.  We sang on a motherfucking taxi.  That's a privileged school. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  You get to do stuff like that if you have parents that are doing okay.  Two hundred and forty bucks and it's all gone.  Dude, I stayed up worrying about finals and I could have just said, fuck it, like this guy?  Just, you know why?  Because it feels good.  It feels good.  I do like that that's his number, though.  That his defense, yes, I'm supporting them.  I gave my six kids $243.  Two hundred and forty bucks.  They took my whole two hundred and forty three bucks. 
[01:20:30]  Left nothing for me, yo.  But you know what?  He should have used the rubber bee.  Get to the commercial break because then we know how this ends, obviously.  And then we'll go to the end for...  No, there's no resolution to any of these.  He's not searching for any solutions.  Yes, he is.  Start knocking, search.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm going to check.  How's that mean?  How's that on me, Chopsport?  Say, start on my check and it don't get to you.  Let's get something really clear.  That's right.  What has to happen here.  Oh, here he comes.  Is that we have to find a way to balance out your needs, your needs, and your responsibilities. 
[01:21:00]  All right, then.  And that's it.  What happened to his black scent?  Because what's going on here is all of this animosity and this anger...  Do you hear this now?  Now he sounds like my accountant.  Yeah.  All of this bickering back and forth ain't helping their kids.  Oh, he's flying back, though.  Sort of.  The point that I'm making is, the point that I'm making is, my child support gets paid.  Not to me, though.  Regardless. 
[01:21:30]  My child support gets garnished for my checks.  I don't care about that because I know it's going to my son's.  But when I actually try to see my kids, I can't even go to her mom's house without the cops being called.  Hey, I got a great idea.  Their moms are here.  Let's bring them out in just a minute.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Search is so ready.  Damn, Search.  Go to the end.  We don't give a fuck.  Yeah, who cares?  We know how this ends.  Yeah, go to his Search 60.  So we could just wrap this up somehow.  Yeah, where he gives his little...  Good find, though, Anthony.  Yeah, this guy...  Stinks.  I will be watching this for a couple of days now. 
[01:22:00]  I got to see.  That guy looks like he's on the dope.  Yeah, he does look like a crackhead.  That might be close enough.  When you think you're right.  You know what?  I might be wrong on this one.  Maybe.  What?  What happened to the...  I was going to rewind it just a little bit.  Come on, Sam.  You're ruining everything again.  Well, we don't want to miss any of the...  That is true.  No, he looks into the camera, yo.  Oh, wow.  He looks into that camera.  Let's see what happens.  Is he going to wrap up the show here? 
[01:22:30]  I commend you for being a father to those nine children.  That is...  Nine children.  It's just...  That's a new story.  Look at him.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You manned up.  You know what I'm saying?  But if you're going to move forward in this relationship, there has to be compromise.  It's true.  You have to be able to look at each other and say, even when you think you're right, you  know what?  I might be wrong on this one.  Ah.  Oh, dude.  Ah.  Fuck.  Dash.  Here it goes.  Don't go nowhere. 
[01:23:00]  We'll be right back.  Don't go nowhere.  That's right.  We'll be right back.  Is that it?  It's it.  What happened to Search is 60?  Yeah.  I want Search is 60.  They cut it out?  Well, I saved it on my phone.  Thank God.  You did?  Yeah.  Next time on Search.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I had to.  It was the best thing I ever saw.  Oh, my God.  Really?  It's fucking great.  Why is it on YouTube?  I don't know.  You recorded it on your phone?  I had to.  It was one of the greatest things I ever heard on television. 
[01:23:30]  He's the worst.  You want to hear Search is 60?  Yeah, he's a lot.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's crank this up.  Yo.  Yeah, let's crank it, yo.  I hope it's loud.  I want to thank all of you for being here.  It is not easy to air it out on national television, so I want to appreciate and thank  you all for doing that.  My Search 60 is a simple one.  One of my favorite terms from back in the 80s is front.  People like to front.  They like to front on their true feelings and mask it with anger, with rage, with disappointment, 
[01:24:00]  with hurt.  Or sometimes they front it with comedy and laughter.  But what's no joke is taking care of our babies.  And we got a lot of babies to take care of.  In the words of my wife, Chantel, please remember throughout your day to say what you mean  and mean what you say.  If someone turns to you and says, have a good day, turn around and say, no, you have a better  one.  My name is Search.  And it is not a game, people.  And this is not a game, people.  This is good, this guy.  All it is is a game.  I thought you said we were kicking game.  What is it, a game?  Are you kicking game or are you not kicking game? 
[01:24:30]  I don't even know what he's doing.  That was just a game.  That was better than Candy Crush.  Yeah.  Watching that shit.  In the words of my wife, Chantel, in every single bumper sticker from a black radio station,  mean what you say and say what you mean.  It's just some contrived fucking urban crap.  Keep your mind on your money and your money on your mind.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  Like my wife, Chantel, said, keep your hat in the foyer.  What?  Shut up.  Like my wife, Chantel, said, hey, Chantel, you here? 
[01:25:00]  I gave you some props today on the show, on the search show.  Oh, my account's on the phone?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hello?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, we're doing very well.  How's that hedge fund?  How's the hedge fund doing?  How's the hedge fund?  Right.  This guy's a liar.  I just want to make sure my accountant's keeping it real.  He didn't grow up in the streets.  No.  Fame high school.  It seems like he was a privileged kid.  And he didn't have a world tour that had anything to do with him.  World tour? 
[01:25:30]  There's no fucking way.  How many hits did they have?  Third base?  Yeah.  What's their biggest song?  They had a couple, I sort of remember.  Kind of.  Didn't they have a baseball one?  Did they?  I don't know.  I'm kind of distracted.  Why is that?  MC Surgis Facebook.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Who did this?  Why is it giant black penises all over it?  Who did it? 
[01:26:00]  You know, we didn't even bring it up.  I want to go on record and say we didn't say shit.  Why is there a progeria?  Oh, no.  It's little Beavis.  Did you put that t-shirt on Beavis?  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  We didn't even mention that he even had a Facebook page.  Why are they doing this?  Come on.  That's rude.  Come on, man.  Oh, my God.  This is terrible. 
[01:26:30]  He's going to be so disappointed.  Oh, boy.  MC Surgis.  He's got some mean fans.  This is not keeping it real.  No, they keep it real on the Facebook.  Some fan he's got named AJ Poopy Shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  Black penises.  Who are they pointing the penises at?  I can't even see.  It's Troy, and it says I got a Troy on my house.  Troy, who works for the Opie and Anthony show.  That's Troy?  It's an old photo of him in his rap days.  Troy, you got a Troy on my house. 
[01:27:00]  That's terrible.  You will hear Troy's voice soon on this fucking radio show.  I'm telling you right now.  That's the next order of business.  DATOM Relationship Show.  Search.  Yo.  I was digging it.  Oh, no.  Can we go out with one of Search's songs?  No.  Which one?  Yeah, what do you got in the system there, Travis?  We played it already.  No, the one song.  Yo, play it.  The third base guys.  You want some third base? 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  Name some of the third base songs we got in the system.  I have Brooklyn Queens.  Oh, man.  Oh, Troy just ran in because he knows.  No, Troy really loves third base.  Oh, Pop Goes the Weasel.  Pop Goes the Weasel.  What?  Troy loves third base?  Yes.  Pop Goes the Weasel was their big hit.  Pop Goes the Weasel.  Yeah, that was their big hit.  Pop Goes the Weasel was the biggest song.  And the only song.  They're officially a one-hit wonder.  He quoted gas face, that term.  Yeah?  Yes.  Whatever that...  I remember the term, actually.  He has a song called The Gas Face.  That is a big song, too.  We can play that if you want.  It's the face I make after I cut the... 
[01:28:00]  Oh, well, I couldn't think of it.  Play the Pop Goes the Weasel because that was the big hit from these guys.  They were a one-hit wonder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm telling you.  Absolutely.  You don't go on a world tour because you have one song.  World tour?  Keeping it real?  Kicking real things?  Troy tells me that this song is dissing Vanilla Ice.  What?  Oh, God, I hate these.  Vanilla Ice is the weasel.  Don't start a war.  Oh, man.  What?  He's trying to say that Vanilla Ice isn't cool and he is?  That's right.  In 91, he was sitting there. 
[01:28:30]  I would bet Vanilla Ice is cooler than this guy.  Well, Vanilla Ice is fucking flipping houses and becoming a multi-gazillionaire and fucking...  And you're doing a Maury rip-off show.  And you're ripping off the Maury.  And I know they got you cheap because you don't have much going on in your career, yo.  Obviously, you failed at radio.  It's like Vanilla Ice said, drop the zero and get with a hero.  What?  A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Your arm's too short to box with God.  Cornbread Earl and me.  I just said something that meant nothing. 
[01:29:00]  He really was awful fucking...  Just a trite quote.  That was horrid.  There he is.  Wait, go back.  Oh, he was a fat kid?  That's a big hit right there.  It was for a week or two.  Pop, pop goes the weasel, the weasel.  It was.  I remember that one.  I do.  Me too.  I do remember that.  What happened to the other guy?  The other white guy in that band?  Yeah, what happened to him?  Did he just stay white?  I guess he just became a white guy.  Became a white guy?  Go to his Wikipedia.  Our other third bass expert is coming in to tell you all about it. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, wait, wait.  How is...  He kept singing.  Oh, God.  He rocked in those third basses.  How do you know...  He's never gotten there.  I mean, I know third bass, the basic shit, but what do you know about him?  He was singing the songs.  The other guy is Pete Nice.  Right.  Pete Nice.  When all this went away, he moved up to Cooperstown and opened up a memorabilia shop.  Fantastic.  Why did you like him when you were younger?  Because you'd put on glasses and beat him for Halloween?  I get it.  I get it. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  That's all you know?  That's the last I heard.  There used to be a whole thing when they would do the Little League World Series and events  up at Cooperstown.  He was always on those things.  So he's a baseball fan?  Yeah, it was huge.  I think he lost the shop.  I'm not 100% sure.  I don't think he has it anymore.  Of course.  But it was a big thing.  He'd have one little picture of him up in there, of him as Pete Nice, back in the late  80s, early 90s.  That's the third base guy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't have that shop anymore. 
[01:30:30]  What happened to him?  Oh, wow.  Now he has a sports bar in Boston that he owns with Ken Casey from the Dropkick Murphys.  Oh, that sounds like a good gig.  That sounds nice.  Right.  All right.  That sounds like a good little thing for him.  Yeah.  It all worked out.  Yeah.  And now they get to watch MC Search on TV.  And Vanilla Ice owns the entire block.  Yeah, Vanilla Ice.  And you're probably paying rent to him.  He's your fucking landlord.  How did that work out for you guys?  Someone was giving you shit in the back because you said he was from Ace of Base. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, well, what do I know?  Who was giving a shit?  That would be our own Dennis Falcone.  Oh, well, what is Dennis?  You guys want to hear from him?  No.  I believe I'm not.  No?  Are you sure?  We haven't heard from him this year.  At one point, he yelled MC Search keeping it real and the whole hallway hurt him and no  one reacted to it.  Of course no one reacts.  He likes to...  Dennis likes third base?  Well, he was just...  I think he was disappointed by Anthony's lack of musical knowledge.  Lack of fucking...  I didn't listen to that shit even back then. 
[01:31:30]  What was Ace of Base's hit?  They had like...  All that she wants is another baby.  I can't say that I have to sing it.  I saw the signs.  I saw the signs.  Ace of Base's hit.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the signs.  Life's demanding.  Her version is better than theirs.  Without understanding.  No, I saw the signs.  Isn't there a commercial where they're using I saw the signs?  Because someone tweeted me that they should have used our version from that.  Another person, by the way, that wants nothing to do with us. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Remember her?  Yeah.  I love it.  I love this.  I love this.  I'm just bothered.  You're not the one for me.  Is enough enough.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[01:32:30]  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  Here it comes.  Take down.  Where's who you belong?  That rules.  That was so fucking good.  That was our karaoke contest?  Yeah.  She just wanted a Mac for college.  What?  She wanted a Mac for college?  Can we get that on the docket? 
[01:33:00]  Can we do another karaoke contest immediately?  I saw the signs.  Can we get a prize?  We need a good prize.  Computer's a great prize, man.  Laptop is a great fucking prize.  People love computers.  But we are a media destination, so.  If you're a media destination, you can get laptops easily.  That's true.  What happened to Dennis Falcone?  I thought he was gonna come down here.  Dennis Falcone.  With his hard drive of hits.  You know what? 
[01:33:30]  What?  Oh, yeah.  When she kicks in, she's so into it.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad.  Hold on.  How long ago was that?  By the way.  Oh, Dennis is coming down.  And then Travis just told me he has the full three-minute version.  Holy shit.  The in-studio version.  Wow.  No, it's different.  We have her version, and then she came in and sang it live.  Live version.  Right.  Which one you got?  I have both.  But I don't think when she sang it live, it quite... 
[01:34:00]  It didn't capture the magic of that.  You're right.  Dennis Falcone for the first time.  Dennis, new for 2014.  Dennis Falcone.  First time.  Falcone.  Denny, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize that was...  You said before you said Ace of Bass.  Ace of...  I knew it was some kind of bass thing, you know?  That's all I knew.  And you didn't play their other song, The Gas Face.  Remember that one?  That was a big hit.  The Gas Face was a big hit.  I want to hear that.  I did say that.  Let's hear The Gas Face.  Was that a big hit?  Were they a two-hit wonder?  They got three hits.  Yeah, they were around three hits.  There's a few bands that were two-hit wonders. 
[01:34:30]  We all talk about the one-hit wonders, but there are a few with the two-hits.  They got three.  Is that fine?  Yeah.  Two-hit wonder weekend.  Like a Tone Loke is a two-hit wonder.  But that's the same hit twice.  That's the same song.  That doesn't count.  Right.  Funky Cold Medina.  What about Young MC?  Young MC was a two-hit wonder.  What was those?  Principal's Office.  He had a...  No, don't even say Principal's Office.  He had a twist on Bust a Move.  A little twist.  Young MC and Principal's Office, I think.  Oh, Principal's Office wasn't a hit.  It was the follow-up.  Nah, it wasn't a hit, though.  The follow-up.  Follow-up.  The follow-up that flopped weekend. 
[01:35:00]  What about I always feel like somebody's watching me?  Rockwell.  Oh?  I remember this.  This is Third Base.  Gasface.  This was a bigger song, I think.  Yeah?  This was the first one.  What's that?  It wasn't bigger than Pop Goes the Rezo.  Nah, it's sort of. 
[01:35:30]  I do.  Nah, whatever.  It's just 80s rap.  Yeah, that was 89 and the other one was 91.  91.  91.  91.  91.  91.  91.  How was your New Year's?  I had a good time.  You did?  I had a good time.  What'd you do?  I worked in an Italian restaurant.  Good times, great oldies?  Or just good times?  You worked in an Italian restaurant.  Did you have the bottle red or the bottle white?  I don't drink when I work.  Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight?  I don't drink when I DJ.  No, everybody else does. 
[01:36:00]  Heavily.  No, we had a good time.  A good time was had by all.  Playing the music and making people dance and bringing in 2014 on an up note.  Did you do the big countdown?  Oh, yeah.  What'd you play at midnight?  I played the Sal Soul Orchestra New Year's Medley.  That's a great one.  I got great news.  The Sal Soul Orchestra New Year's Medley.  I got great news.  Hold on a second, guys, please, if you will.  Hold on one second.  I got great news.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, it's Marion. 
[01:36:30]  How are you?  Hi, Marion.  Hey, Marion, is that you on Twitter?  Yes, it is.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  I don't know anything about Twitter.  Congratulations for being on Twitter.  We've been waiting for you.  I am not on Twitter.  I actually was following you for a while.  Yeah, we're following you.  So far, you've had some great tweets on Twitter.  I love Marion's tweets.  It's, hi, Anthony, hi, Opie.  It's definitely you, because you say, hi, Anthony, and hi, Opie.  Yeah, and it's your picture.  And I got to tell you, between me and you, and I'm sure not many people listen right now,  you're better than Lady Di on Twitter. 
[01:37:00]  Absolutely.  Blows Lady Di away.  What?  So what is your Twitter?  Because I want more people to follow you.  Give out your Twitter.  Listen to me.  I am not on Twitter.  Oh, you could be coy.  I know.  Yeah, we know.  Wink, wink.  I know you're not on Twitter.  Wink, wink.  You're calling, you know.  You want to downplay it a little bit.  Exactly.  I get it.  No problem.  What else?  All right, we'll play along.  So what are you going to do with this Twitter account?  I swear, it's not.  Because right now, you're just saying, hi, Anthony, and hi, Opie a lot. 
[01:37:30]  But eventually, what kind of tweets can we expect from Marion?  Neither, nor.  What?  I am not on it, okay?  Oh, sure you're not.  Right, it's an imposter.  With your name.  I get you.  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  Marion?  She's gone.  She hung up.  All right, back to Dennis Falcone.  I hope the phone was punched out of her hand.  By the way, Chris Cuomo and Dennis Rodman went at it.  What?  Yeah, we're going to have the audio. 
[01:38:00]  Can we get that audio?  They did.  They went at it.  Is he not happy with the fact that he's playing diplomat with a tyrant?  Maybe we could just go to this feed.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, watch this.  I'm going to tell you.  All right, no, we've got to start from the beginning.  Oh, we've got to start from the beginning.  Because it's sort of going viral.  Rodman and Chris Cuomo from CNN went at it.  How about Chris Cuomo goes at it?  He's probably mad that he's over there talking to a dictator.  Meanwhile, you didn't go after reporters who interviewed bin Laden.  Why should they be the only ones who are allowed to talk to these guys? 
[01:38:30]  Well, there you go.  It is a good point, but Dennis Rodman's a fucking twat.  Well, you know what it is, too.  The reporters at least talking to...  I hope he gets fed to the dogs over there.  Talking to bin Laden might have been as, I guess, what's the word I'm looking for?  They weren't really going one way or another on their opinions of him.  Understandable, yeah.  Yeah.  Now, Rodman is this guy's biggest fucking cheerleader.  Well, then why does the press show him?  The only reason Dennis Rodman gets any coverage of what he's saying, they show him. 
[01:39:00]  They could say, like, oh, and Dennis Rodman went over to North Korea.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's almost like if I showed you a video and go, why are you people watching this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I showed you.  Right.  The move would be, you know, we're not going to play into this bullshit.  Yeah, we don't think it's news.  So we're not going to show you Dennis Rodman with a bunch of sad basketball players that  used to have really good NBA careers.  The saddest fucking dream team ever.  Have you heard about the dream team?  What?  The one guy, I think it's, oh boy, I think it's Doug Christie. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Who used to play in the NBA.  He's now making educational pornos with his wife.  Oh, that's the guy that makes the educational pornos.  I think it was Doug Christie.  We're going to have to double check.  Ooh.  Because that's something you've got to be careful with.  But they're all a wreck, and these guys all were in the NBA, and now they have nothing  going for them.  So they went over there with Dennis Rodman.  He making a porno, but they all a wreck?  Nice.  Dennis, you done?  I'm just waiting for you guys to dismiss me. 
[01:40:00]  The slow head turn from Jimmy North on that one.  Wow.  We've got to finish up with Dennis.  I just want to thank you, though, for the Super Show.  I thought that was a blast.  Wasn't that great?  And let me tell you, you got kudos, and you got, I think, a lot of brand new fans from  that whole group.  Sam, can we put on the docket Super Show 2?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  When do you want to do Super Show 2?  What do you think, guys?  Oh, man.  It's got to be kind of...  Should make it an annual thing.  Well, you know what?  An annual? 
[01:40:30]  That's a quarterly.  If somebody's birthday is coming up in February, we might want to throw a special birthday party.  Who's Jimmy's?  It's my birthday.  E-Rox?  Lady Di.  Oh, God.  And I think a birthday party for Lady Di would be a really special thing to do.  Oh, boy.  Birthday party slash Super Show 2?  Well, I'd invite guests.  That would be good.  All right, let's put it on the docket.  A lot of birthday party hats and costumes and...  And then this time, we could just force our way into Taylor's show. 
[01:41:00]  Cow pins the tail on the dog.  Is she still in trouble?  We gave her amazing radio.  Oh, that's right.  I heard she was in trouble.  And then this fucking place yelled and screamed at her.  Who did it?  Was it her boss or the company?  Was it her boss?  What channel is that?  It's Cosmo.  And she's a...  Starz.  What is she?  Starz.  Starz.  Did we get rid of the Cosmo channel?  Yeah, her show.  Cosmo has a...  I don't listen to most of these channels.  We finally gave them a good piece of interview and they're mad at her.  Oh, why would they be?  Yeah.  I mean, that's what's cool about radio. 
[01:41:30]  When you tune it in and they give you something so off the wall and different.  You're like, what the fuck?  Yeah, you don't think...  As long as you don't do that every day, I guess.  Do you think the people that were listening to that channel at that moment tuned away?  Hell no.  Or were they sitting there going,  and what the hell is this?  I need a listener.  Right.  Right.  It was amazing.  That's creating that water cooler talk.  Right, Dennis?  That's what about it.  That's your job as a DJ.  And that's why radio stinks, because that's the thinking in regular radio.  Oh, you're a little different, Doug. 
[01:42:00]  What are you doing?  Stop it.  Problems.  You've got to do the same thing every day.  Keep the same.  You don't want listeners to think it's something different.  You've got to let them go different.  Exactly.  If you do that every day, then fuck.  I could see where a programmer would have a problem with that.  One like that.  That was great.  So we're not going to be able to go back on her show with these whack jobs?  I mean, last time it was unique, because she had an open door policy.  I don't know if she'd actually book these people on her show.  Right.  Well, why don't we do this? 
[01:42:30]  Why don't we put the Lady Di birthday party on the docket?  Oh, yeah.  It's on the docket, and that'll be officially the return of the super show, because the  super show has become a thing.  Yeah.  Like the super show.  It's become a thing.  You want to do it to kick off the spring book?  Spring book.  He is so radio.  I love it.  You just brought back memories.  He did.  The radio station would sit around. 
[01:43:00]  How are we going to kick off the spring book, everyone?  We're going to fucking have something.  Right.  Some big event for the big important spring book.  Maybe we could give away a car for the spring book.  Yeah.  That's right.  The next time you could win a key.  We'll give away keys, and only one of the keys will start the car.  Start the lousy fucking rusted Mustang.  Oops.  Whatever that was.  Yeah.  But Dave threw us under the bus.  No, he certainly did.  We promoted the Mustang giveaway up in Boston.  Yeah.  And it was going to be...  I forgot why it had to be an old Mustang, because the station was celebrating 25 
[01:43:30]  years, so they got a 25-year-old Mustang.  Something like that.  Yeah, some kind of thing.  And all of a sudden, we're promoting the fuck out of it, and then the car falls through,  or the dealership falls through.  So instead of being smart and going, ah, fuck it.  Let's spin this somehow in the air and get out of this.  Uh-huh.  He actually went to me and Ann, because it was our promotion for some reason, or we  were spearheading it or whatever.  Oh, God.  And he goes, just keep promoting.  I'll figure it out.  We'll get it.  We'll figure it out.  And he finds a piece of shit Mustang, like, the last minute. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, they spray paint it.  Could you find the news clip?  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a news clip about it.  We played this news clip.  I know.  I love it.  Yes.  The hardcores already know this story, but we're trying to maybe get some other.  Oh, was this fucking people.  Find the, and then we'll go back to the Rodman, and then we'll fucking wrap it up with Dennis  Falcone, and then we'll put the Super Show 2 on the docket.  Don't you worry.  We got Dean Cain, too, soon, you know.  Oh, fuck.  And he just checked in.  Oh, boy. 
[01:44:30]  Well, just give me the news clip.  He's scheduled for 845.  Oh, man.  That went bad.  By the way, I listened to the full version of the sign.  Yeah.  I really recommend that you play it.  It's been a long time since we listened to it.  Oh, okay.  All right, Dennis, we got to kick you out.  Okay.  Dennis Falcone, thank you.  We'll have you back for a longer segment.  Thank you, guys.  I appreciate it.  You know, it's good poking your head in for 2014.  And now we got to get the news clip of the Mustang giveaway at AAF.  I don't know where it is.  Fuck, we played it once.  We did, didn't we? 
[01:45:00]  What got it?  Was it EROC?  Write AAF.  WAF.  AAF.  Oh, yes.  AAF.  Yeah, just write, open Anthony, WAF videos, what comes up.  They're all horrific ones, I'm sure.  News, maybe, car.  Car thing.  Giveaway car.  Mustang.  Mustang.  News, WAF.  Nope.  Mustang.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Mustang video.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did you put Mustang in there?  Mm-mm.  Put Mustang in there.  Giveaway.  That's right.  Put We Sock.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We have played this clip, so.  I know.  Maybe it was on the old website.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  If someone has a link, send it to us.  We're going to go to break with I Swore the Signs, the long version. 
[01:46:00]  The full version.  From our karaoke contest.  Yes.  And now.  Oh, you got it?  Oh.  Yeah, this is it.  Okay, this is it.  Jesus, this is embarrassing.  Now, this is New Center 5.  I hate this.  You're always in trouble.  Always.  Still to come, a winning prize or a losing lemon?  Susan Warren expired. 
[01:46:30]  Beware, report is next.  Tina Tucker was thrilled when she won a radio contest for a classic car.  Radio station WAAF handed her the keys to a vintage Mustang.  But when she took a closer look, she noted her prize belonged in the junk heap and not her driveway.  Who's responsible here?  Susan Warnick with tonight's Buyer Beware.  Oh.  Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Tina Tucker couldn't believe her luck last February when she held the winning key in WAAF's Sam Adams White Ale Mustang contest. 
[01:47:00]  Sam Adams again.  They gave me a key along with nine other people, and we all had a chance to try it.  Mine started it.  Tina won a 1967 white Mustang.  I knew it wasn't going to be like a 1998 Mustang, but I never expected it to be in this shape.  Tina's prize had body rot, a bad paint job, ripped seats, and broken equipment.  And it wouldn't start.  It's a piece of junk. 
[01:47:30]  It really is.  It's embarrassing.  It's very embarrassing.  Tina had the car towed to a repair shop, where it's been virtually untouched since March,  because Tina says she couldn't get WAAF to fix it.  No, they have not been cooperative until this past weekend when you got in touch with them.  They had no part of me.  My stepfather got in contact with them.  They were very rude to my father, and they have had nothing to do with me.  They've washed the hands of me and this car for the past five months. 
[01:48:00]  We're very much evicted.  I'm just Tina up here.  Well, Dave.  It was.  Dave Douglas.  This is great.  You've got to give me the link.  I've got to tweet this.  This is the guy we talk about.  That's Dave Dickless.  I love Dave Douglas stories.  We're very much a victim in this, too.  Oh, God.  He wore his blazer and tie to be interviewed by the news that day.  That is fucking...  Send me that link and just back up on this, please, Sam.  Oh, his fucking syndrome cut.  Oh, my God. 
[01:48:30]  This is the best.  While they admit giving Tina a seriously damaged car, WAAF management says it's not their fault.  They blame the people from whom they got the car.  We trusted this organization to deliver the vehicle in good working order, and they didn't do that.  It's completely false.  Rich Marco runs the National Veterans Scholarship Fund.  They resell donated cars for scholarship money and agreed to give WAAF the Mustang in exchange for free advertising. 
[01:49:00]  But Marco insists the car was given as is.  It's basically, here's your car, and that's it.  Now that the promo's over, they're coming back to me.  In fact, WAAF has contacted the Attorney General's office asking for an investigation of the National Veterans Scholarship Fund.  But they didn't do it until the very day we called asking about Tina's car.  And the scholarship fund is in good standing with the Department of Public Charities, which Marco says he's happy to talk to any investigator. 
[01:49:30]  Here we are trying to do something good.  I haven't heard from WAAF in months.  And now, instead of calling me, they're calling me Attorney General.  You know, that's fine.  I mean, we've done nothing wrong.  This afternoon, WAAF assumed full responsibility for the Mustang, promising to pay for its full refurbishing and delivery to Tina within a month.  And even though they weren't directly involved in the car deal, Sam Adams' beer has vowed to make good if WAAF doesn't. 
[01:50:00]  Boy, did we fuck Sam Adams a few times.  Poor Sam Adams.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, that is so fucking bad, man.  Sorry.  You really let one out.  Oh, my God.  I saw our old friend.  What the hell is that?  Tonight I'm on my way to a woman.  What the hell is that?  I saw our old pal Jim Cook.  I was driving in the city.  I forgot where.  I think I was just going out to Long Island.  And I was on, like, 2nd or 3rd Avenue, which one goes south. 
[01:50:30]  I always forget.  2nd?  2nd, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd.  And all of a sudden, I saw Jim Cook walking by a hotel.  As I'm stopped at a light, and I started rolling down the window to say hi.  And I'm like, I can't.  Did you just run away?  I didn't say hi.  Stay away from me, please.  Right.  You destroyed my reputation and my beer.  We used to be so close with this guy.  And I saw him, and I just knew that I can't say hi to him anymore.  We fucked him over too many times.  I forgot.  I'll never forget the phone call where he calls me after Sex for Sam, basically saying how much he loves us. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Saying, you're going to read some awful stuff, maybe about you guys.  But he goes, you've got to understand, I'm trying to save my ass.  It's like Paulie in fucking Goodfellas.  Now I've got to turn my back on you.  Yes, exactly.  But I mean, that's a real man.  He actually called me to tell me exactly what was going down.  That he had to fucking, you know, save his ass.  Holy shit.  That was funny. 
[01:51:30]  The Mustang?  Memories.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm going to.  I'm Opie Radio on Twitter.  I'll send that link to that story in a second or two.  Dave Douglas always looked like that fucking SNL bit.  Yeah.  Where fucking, what's his name, was with the cigarette on 60 Minutes?  Oh, Martin Short.  Martin Short, all nervous.  Right.  What are you talking about?  And he always looked like that whenever they put him on the news.  Oh, God.  We're just as much of a victim.  You know how we, remember just breaking out in a cold sweat every time you saw the news start? 
[01:52:00]  Yes!  How many times?  It was so petrifying.  We've been out on the news for a while.  It's good and bad, I guess.  When you see your face on there during a promo.  Yeah.  And coming up and you're like, oh, no.  You get all sweaty and nervous.  I think the news finally just gave up on us.  Oh, thank God.  But there were so many times the news would start and you know it would be some horrific story about you.  Terrible.  About us.  Yeah.  You would just sweat it out. 
[01:52:30]  And then we would call each other and go, that wasn't too bad.  All right.  Not too bad.  It wasn't too bad.  I think we're all right.  I think we're all right.  You haven't heard from anyone, have you?  No?  No, I haven't heard anything.  I'll call you if I hear anything.  Dude, I'll call you for the 10 o'clock news and then the 11 o'clock.  Hopefully we'll make it through to the morning.  Maybe something will happen.  I think we're going to skate on this one.  I think we're okay.  They let us back on the air today.  I think we're all right.  Jesus.  Oh, we weren't all right a few times, huh?  Nope.  We weren't.  How many times have we been fired? 
[01:53:00]  At least two, right?  Suspended God knows how many times.  Yeah.  All right.  I saw the sign and then a little break and then Dean Cain.  Stay right there.  Got Dean Cain outside the studio.  Yes, we do.  I was just having a little chat with Mr. Cain.  Oh.  He's a good man.  I like Dean Cain.  Nice.  And he's suffering from allergies.  What?  Dean Cain. 
[01:53:30]  I got to tell everyone you're suffering from allergies.  It's true.  Take a seat.  We like having a little inside info.  Why do I have to be next to the funniest guy on the planet?  You know Jim Norris, Dean?  Yes, we know each other.  I was saying outside, it's not fair.  Not fair, huh?  You guys have done red-eyed together on Fox, right?  Yes, we do.  I'm doing red-eyed right now with my allergies.  Oh, man.  What kind of allergies are you getting in the winter?  I don't know.  New York City hotel room allergies.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe some dust mites.  It could be.  He's allergic to the dust mites.  You don't want those. 
[01:54:00]  I have a home in Colorado, though, so I actually like this weather.  I know.  I'm sorry to anyone who hates it.  Wow, yeah.  You like the cold?  I like your ice on the inside of the windows.  Isn't that cool?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  The ice is on the inside of the windows here in this building today.  To tell you what kind of day I'm having, I actually wondered, like, what would that  feel like throwing myself through it?  Let's see.  We're keeping our fingers crossed.  Jimmy.  You are here.  Wait, wait.  I want to talk about Colorado for a second. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, I wanted to talk about Bigfoot.  Well, we only have a few minutes with them.  Those two can be the same at some times.  That is true.  Well, you've got the red eyes, Colorado.  I'm thinking pot.  What do you think of the whole pot thing in Colorado?  Good for them.  I think that the residents of Colorado, which I am not, voted and they approved it.  Good for them.  I have a ranch out there, and if I could get some sort of horticulture guy to come out  there and start growing some pot on there, maybe I could make some money.  Are you allowed to do that?  I think it's a lot easier to get a license to sell it is than it is to grow it. 
[01:55:00]  To grow it, yeah.  But I haven't really looked into that yet.  We were talking about the fact that all of a sudden, legal, they had all this weed to  sell.  All those people were growing it illegally only a few months ago.  Yeah, where did it come from right after they signed the bill?  It was like, yeah, now we have a bunch of weed.  I assume they would have to start from zero and throw some seeds in the ground.  I'll say this.  They are ready to go.  I don't smoke, and some people that I know do, and that's great for them.  My father has Parkinson's, and I have witnessed with my own eyes. 
[01:55:30]  My father's handshake, handshake, handshake.  He takes a hit of his weed, medicinal, hand-stop shaking.  Yeah, what's wrong with that, then?  I have no problem.  I'm more of a libertarian than that.  I don't care.  Do what you want to in your own house.  Right.  Grow what you want to, whatever.  But that's just not my thing.  My son won't.  I won't.  But rock and roll, we're adults here.  I like when people are able to exercise their own responsibilities and rights and do it  that way.  Absolutely.  What's on your ranch? 
[01:56:00]  Horses right now.  Just horses.  Horses and hay.  Do you ride them?  Yeah.  Okay.  Except soon it's to be Mary Jane.  She's going to move in soon.  Because it's real money.  I saw pictures of that in Colorado.  I saw pictures of people lined up around the block in Denver.  So I thought that can't be a bad business.  Yeah, you would think.  Free market.  Go ahead.  Can you just go to Denver, buy shit, and you have to get it from somebody, then just  mail it to yourself?  Why don't people just mail drugs to themselves?  They do. 
[01:56:30]  I think they do.  But occasionally they do sniff around those parcels.  Yeah, but they can't prove who mailed it, can they?  Why am I acting like I just made up the idea of mailing drugs?  What a dope.  No one thought of that.  A dope box for Jim Norton from Jim Norton.  Who's that guy?  That's not me.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, Dean's here to talk about the $10 million Bigfoot bounty.  That's correct.  This is premiering Friday on Spike TV, 10 o'clock.  Finally, putting some money behind this whole thing.  Like, is there a Bigfoot? 
[01:57:00]  Is there not?  Here's $10 million.  Prove it.  That's pretty much what it came down to.  I like it.  Well, it's pretty clear.  Everybody has their theories.  Everybody wonders.  Everybody talks about it.  My brother is a Bigfoot believer.  Wow, really?  So much so that I, you know, in SkyMall, when you fly, you see the SkyMall catalog.  Oh, sure do.  And that little Bigfoot, that little Yeti statue.  Well, what do you think he got for Christmas?  I got the Velociraptor up by my jacuzzi.  See, there we go.  Is this all shot already? 
[01:57:30]  We have shot it, yes.  Okay, so you know the answer.  Yeah, I do know the answer.  So how about you tell us?  Let's make news today.  Hey, you know that $10 million?  I don't want that coming out of my pocket.  Okay, you signed a few contracts.  Yeah, there are a few contracts.  Now, what the idea behind what we're at with us, you have to prove, here's our qualifications for this.  It's backed by Lloyds of London, so this is no little endeavor.  You have to prove, you have to have irrefutable DNA and visual evidence.  And what happens is, with a lot of these people, when they go out there and they say they have, 
[01:58:00]  other than the stories where they say they've killed him and or, you know, taken a tissue sample,  you can use a biopsy dart gun, which will actually shoot a dart into you,  and it takes a little bit of your flesh and a little bit of hair,  and from that we can extract DNA and prove the existence of a non-human primate that hasn't been studied before.  Wow.  You do that and get a picture, and you win $10 million.  What about the guy that's in the news right now, the guy Dyer, who's been involved in Bigfoot hoaxes before?  Do you believe him or do you not believe him?  He has a close-up of a face.  Right. 
[01:58:30]  He looks like the Heat-Mizer from fucking...  He's a Bigfoot hack.  I was thinking that looked more like brown gargantua from...  Yeah, all right.  Battle of the gargantuans, yes.  Battle of the gargantuans.  Or it could also be Harry and the Hendersons.  It was pretty close.  That one, I saw that picture.  And he only showed people that believe in Santa Claus, by the way, that Anthony pointed out brilliantly.  Little kids.  The 134 people.  I had 135.  I saw that a little bit.  Yeah.  Look, on average, we discover 10,000 to 15,000 new species a year.  Most of them are insects and such.  But when we go out, there were times where we would drive five... 
[01:59:00]  We were up in the Pacific Northwest.  We were already kind of nowhere.  We'd drive five hours, get out of vehicles because you can't go any further, and we'd hike  for two hours before we would even start a field test or a hunt or things like that.  And you see some of that huge space.  You're like, I can see how there could easily be all sorts of things, something.  I mean, we were up in some areas where marijuana is not yet legal, where you could sell there  were some people doing that. 
[01:59:30]  So that was probably more dangerous than any wildlife we might have encountered.  Why don't we just go up there and just destroy the entire forest, like literally with some  type of a weapon.  Just start a huge fire and see what runs out.  Yeah, see what runs out the other side.  Exactly.  Well, that happened.  We had a place where...  We did have a hunt on a place where there had been a big giant fire in an old growth  forest, and so that would drive the wildlife out.  But as soon as the fire's over, wildlife gets right back in there.  That was something we didn't really...  Were you scared of the woods?  No.  I've been out there a lot.  You have a gun? 
[02:00:00]  Well, that's just it.  Normally, I'm armed, and I wasn't allowed to be armed on this for...  Insurance.  Insurance, probably.  Tiki-tac insurance stuff.  What is that?  God damn it.  So we had people who were armed.  I mean, all I could have was a knife.  But against a 350-pound black bear, a brown bear, rather, it's not going to do you much  good.  And we saw a lot of bear and a lot of mountain lion, things like that.  So there were some hairy moments just with other wildlife, not to mention whether or not  we saw Mr. Foote.  They didn't want to give you a gun because they're afraid of the actor shoots camera tech 
[02:00:30]  by mistake or something, and that would be like a disaster.  What?  I'm a damn good animal.  He's well-versed.  He's well-versed.  Yeah.  What state are you actually residing in?  I live in Jersey.  Not you.  I lived in Jersey for a while.  No, I'm in California.  Okay, so you got to...  Although I'm thinking about moving out just for tax purposes.  Yeah, tax is...  Good gosh.  And you got to put up with some ridiculous gun laws, too, over there.  Yes, we have them.  They're ridiculous.  But I'm a big-time Second Amendment guy, so...  Yeah, me too. 
[02:01:00]  Definitely.  Yes.  I actually spent years fighting the system here so I could carry concealed in the city.  That's one of the toughest...  Yes, one of the toughest things to do.  It's a pain in the ass.  It costs...  To exercise a right, it costs thousands of dollars.  You have to go through an examination that is only second to a prostate exam.  You know what?  Well, I actually enjoy having a good prostate. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, well, you got it.  They found Bigfoot.  Amazing.  But thank God the bad guys have to go through the same stuff.  Oh, right.  So we're all safe.  Yes, exactly.  We're all so much safer with a lot of gun control.  That's right.  It's a pain in the ass.  A lot of guys that would probably get a gun, they can't get one.  They can't get one.  And with magazine restrictions and ammo restrictions here, because if you're going to go out and  commit a crime with a gun, you want to make sure you only have seven rounds in there in  New York's state so you don't get in trouble. 
[02:02:00]  Of course.  That's that smart.  No standard bag.  No sense at all.  It makes no sense.  It doesn't.  There's some new reports that came out about that recently, too, which is sort of on the  pro-Second Amendment.  Yeah, where supposedly we're allowed to carry ten rounds in our ten-round magazines now here  in New York, which is still getting crapped on, but apparently they take away a lot and  then they give you a little bit so you can celebrate.  Meanwhile, they've taken away so much.  It doesn't make any sense.  We have to keep fighting.  Do you get any shit because you go on Fox? 
[02:02:30]  Because I've gotten shit from people.  It's like these fucking fake...  Yeah, the people at Fox.  These fucking fake mavericks, these entertainers that won't talk to Fox, like all these douches.  It's like, you won't talk to them because you don't like their political slant?  They don't want to be on the number one news network for 12 years.  Why wouldn't they go on and just fight it out, at least?  Because they're babies, that's why.  That's the thing.  Go on and fight it out, then.  I will go and discuss politics or things like that with anybody.  I'm happy to discuss it.  We can disagree.  That's fine, but that's the way it is. 
[02:03:00]  Listen, in Hollywood, it always happens in the makeup trailer.  You start talking about something like this, and oh, here it comes, and I'll always speak  my mind, and I won't strangle anybody.  I like a nice, spirited debate on things.  It's a lot of fun.  Depends on who you're talking to.  If I'm talking to someone on equal, on the same level of the entertainment ladder as I  am, I'll speak my mind.  If Harvey Weinstein hated Fox, you bet I'd hate them, too.  Well, he's never hired me, so I'm not one of them. 
[02:03:30]  Let's get back to Bigfoot.  Let's.  The best part about this show, you could have a second season if you guys didn't give away  the prize.  It's very true.  Well, not only that.  Are you planning for a second season?  If we did give away the prize, we could very easily go after other things.  Oh, okay.  I see what you're getting at.  Aliens, maybe?  Go for the alien thing?  My brother's a big alien guy.  Loch Ness?  You could go Loch Ness?  That, by the way, might be the greatest thing in the world for me to go after Loch Ness, 
[02:04:00]  other than I would have to go under the water or stuff, which I'm not a big fan of.  What do you think's going on out there?  Because there's some weird shit out there.  I don't even care.  I just want to get out there and drink the scotch.  That's what I was thinking.  I was like, what?  That's authentic.  Nothing in Loch Ness.  No.  The surgeon's photo was faked.  He admitted faking it.  Every photo has been faked.  The surgeon admitted on his deathbed that he faked that photo.  Oh, well.  That was a good one.  What did he have to look at?  That was a good one.  What's that?  I like the fact that they're talking about now, you know, we use a lot of technology on  the show. 
[02:04:30]  So if we'd have a field test, part of what happens is people don't know how to collect  DNA correctly without contaminating it.  So we have a very scientific bent on this show.  We have a mobile lab.  We have Dr. Todd Disitel from New York University, who has himself discovered two or three different  new primate species.  Now, they were from Africa, but he was the DNA guy who tested it, and he's amazing.  We have him, and we have another primatologist, Natalia Reagan.  They are out there with us in a mobile lab, and what happens is people will come across 
[02:05:00]  fecal matter that they hadn't seen.  We have real trackers and hunters and major people, and they'll come across this fecal matter  they haven't seen before.  They'll try to take a sample.  They'll contaminate it.  So you can't test the DNA.  And, you know, short of bringing back a body, which people, somebody wrote something about  somebody who, like, shot a Bigfoot or did something like that, and they claimed this  whole thing, and somebody was screaming about, you can't do that, and this show is going  to promote going to kill Bigfoot.  We're not trying to kill Bigfoot.  We're trying to prove he exists.  We just want a bag of his shit. 
[02:05:30]  It is no big deal.  It's just a hair follicle.  It's a good slug line for the show right there.  I like it.  Wait, the animal people are giving you shit on Bigfoot?  Well, someone will.  I mean, look.  PETA wants you to not have dogs in your house.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  Doesn't Ingrid Newkirk have a dog?  Or, no, one of them from PETA does, right?  Does she really?  No, one of them does.  But she has no rules for her dog.  She lets her dog run wild.  Oh, okay.  I would assume if you have a show that, you know, is going after Bigfoot, that there would 
[02:06:00]  be a problem if you were just advocating you finally do find this new species and just  kill it.  It kind of is a little...  Hey, look there!  Bang!  Imagine if you found it and just tortured it.  Like, they have the Bigfoot, but they're pulling off his fingernails angrily.  Bamboo.  To figure out why he's been hiding for so long.  To us!  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  That's terrible.  Everybody asks the question, though.  Bigfoot's one of those common things that everybody talks about, and everybody wonders,  does he exist?  And we really try to give you an answer on this show. 
[02:06:30]  Mm-hmm.  I walked into pretty skeptical.  I will say after the show, I'm less skeptical.  Oh, okay.  That's all I can say.  All right.  All right.  What does that mean?  Yeah, exactly.  Less skeptical.  All right.  Still a little gray area there.  Yeah, it could have happened.  It could have happened.  Could have happened, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Down plane, maybe?  There was an alien sighting recently by fucking airline pilots.  They said something.  It was in England, and they said something flew, like it was coming directly at the craft,  just for some aliens, and then flew.  The pilot said he actually ducked. 
[02:07:00]  It was coming at the craft so fast.  And then it went over, poof, the craft.  Now, that's funny you say that, because my grandfather and my uncle both flew in the  military, and they are, again, they're not the type that would be like, oh, that's an  alien, or this.  My uncle has told stories, and my grandfather told stories about being up in the air and  seeing stuff like that.  So I don't know if that's going to be a pilot, but you hear a lot of that stuff.  That'd be a tough one to go find out, though.  How do you get up there in the planes and zip around?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  People are fascinated, though, with that type of programming.  Like you're doing with Bigfoot and Aliens and stuff like that.  They do very well on TV.  In Search Of.  People love thinking about it.  Remember in Search Of?  Oh, that was with the Leonard Nimoy.  Oh, yeah.  The old In Search Of show.  The intro was creepy, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Psychic phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Yeah.  And they showed the Bigfoot that was running, and then he stopped, and like, fuck you,  he did like a shuffle, and then kept going from 67 in the woods.  He turned the famous, yeah.  Which was a hoax, by the way.  They finally guy admitted that that was a...  What was his name?  Robert Johnson or something?  That was a damn good one. 
[02:08:00]  Not the Gimlin, Peterson-Gimlin one.  Oh, maybe the 1967 California one.  He was on the horse.  The horse one?  Oh, maybe that's his name.  Oh, yeah, because we were there.  You went right there.  To that exact spot?  We got out...  Well, we were all in that area.  I can't say whether we were in that spot.  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  We were everywhere.  We went to everywhere.  It's all condominiums now.  It's terrible.  It's a sad.  There is nothing out there.  Wow.  Nothing.  For how...  Just miles and miles.  You can't see.  For anything that you can see. 
[02:08:30]  Forget cell phone reception.  Forget anything.  There's nothing.  And nothing for as far as your eye can see.  And then you see a plane go by, and you're like, what is that shiny thing in the air?  Wow, yeah, yeah.  Because you feel like you're in prehistoric times.  There is nothing.  It's got to be nice, though, to be out in the middle of nowhere.  It is cool.  For a few minutes, maybe.  But as soon as you want something like heat, or something breaks, or you look at your laptop  and it's just a hunk of worthless metal, you're like, being nowhere sucks.  I would hate that.  I like modern gentleman's comforts.  I appreciate them as well. 
[02:09:00]  I like a nice hotel suite.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't like fucking toughing it at all.  You're not a camping guy.  No, not a camping guy at all.  Yeah.  Well, you ride horseback, so I'm assuming you spent some time outdoors.  Oh, I spent a lot of time outdoors, yeah.  And we were outdoors the entire time.  But you're going, you take your pack, you pack your water, you pack your food, you do  your thing.  How long were you guys out in the woods for the show?  We were a good five weeks.  Wow.  I got to go home at night.  Well, not at night.  Well, sometimes we'd work all through the night, because that's a good time to hunt. 
[02:09:30]  Yes.  Which, of course, is tough visually, except we had a lot of high technology stuff,  FLIR binoculars and things of that nature.  Oh, nice.  You know, we were, we, we, this wasn't a, this wasn't a low caliber deal.  We were, we were looking.  Some bumpkins out there with a mag light, right?  No, no.  A little more than a.  What's the most interesting is the people who were on the show and who have, everybody  relates a story.  And these guys relate stories left and right.  And we have someone on the show who claims to have killed a Sasquatch as well. 
[02:10:00]  Really?  So, yeah.  Where did he bring the body, though?  That he, he, in Washington state, there are laws on the books where you are not allowed  to harass and or kill Bigfoot.  So you can't do that.  That's on the books.  And apparently, it happened in somewhere in that ballpark.  It was a national park area, per his story.  And it didn't want to get busted, so they buried the body or something.  I don't believe him that he would, and by the way, instead of discovering what could  be the missing link, he's worried about fucking local statutes.  Sounds like nonsense. 
[02:10:30]  You would take the fine.  Yeah, you would.  Even a little jail time at the end.  That is, that is hotly and often debated on the show.  Well, where did he, could he point out where he buried it?  Or did he forget?  Couldn't remember, of course.  Yeah, why would you remember when you shoot and kill the missing link and you're worried  about legal issues?  Why would you remember where you buried it?  That's believable to me.  He's out there.  It's around here somewhere.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I marked it with like a little.  Maybe that tree.  No, no, not that one.  Well, it wouldn't take much.  It wouldn't take a whole lot to pull out your, your, your, your, your knife and cut,  cut off a piece of something that could be tested. 
[02:11:00]  Right, right.  Or just your hand and pull out a piece of hair.  It would actually take nothing.  I would take a year.  As long as the hair has the follicle.  The hair has to have the follicle at the end.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it does?  Yep.  Dean Cain has to go.  They're saying it, not us, sir.  Oh, you're doing the Today Show.  Oh, yeah.  I think you got the Today Show today.  Today.  I'm going to do it today.  Today.  This morning.  So watch that.  Yeah.  Yes, absolutely.  Well, thank you guys for having me.  Thanks for coming.  We've got to come back for a longer segment.  Yes, definitely.  It's this Friday.  This Friday.  January the 10th, 10 o'clock on Spike TV and Real Dean Cain on Twitter.  That sounds fun. 
[02:11:30]  Ooh, that's important.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's important these days.  I joined.  I got about 20-something thousand followers now.  Oh, we'll get you up there.  We'll bump that up for you today.  So I expect after today to be in like the 40,000 area.  Oh, please.  I'm glad you said that.  That's about right.  Come on.  I expect like a million.  Right.  I'll take a good 20,000.  Thank you, guys.  You need a little more scandal.  Let's show the power of the show.  Everyone go follow Dean Cain.  Real Dean Cain on Twitter.  All right.  And thanks, brother.  Dean, thanks so much, man.  Cheers.  Good seeing you, man.  Great seeing you.  Attention, college students. 
[02:12:00]  Are you having trouble punching up that term paper?  Yeah, my professor is killing me.  Need to doctor your dissertation?  Oh, man, would I ever.  Impress your professors with a flurry of words from the new Vossipedia Online.  Awesome.  Simply type in your question, and Vossipedia spits out the appropriate terminology.  What's the capital of Georgia?  Alana.  Wow, it's so easy.  Man, I can't remember the name of the U.S. prison in Cuba.  Guanama Bay.  Oh, that's right.  Vossipedia Online is the most useful research tool since the paperweight. 
[02:12:30]  What's the name of that mountain with the president's faces?  Mountain in Rushmore.  Oh, man, I'm a fucking idiot.  Of course.  What festivity is celebrated with booze and muggings in New Orleans?  Mardi Gras.  Here comes another egg.  Stutter, stammer, and slobber your way through college with helpful hints.  From Vossipedia Online.  What does IQ stand for?  Intellectual quiz.  Man, this is a lifesaver.  Thanks, Vossipedia.  After 20 years, you would want a break, too. 
[02:13:00]  But the guys are back now.  Enjoy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  I want to thank Dean Cain for stopping by. 
[02:13:30]  Follow him on Twitter, RealDeanCain.  A little observation.  A little observation.  Yeah?  We like taking pictures with celebrities.  No one took a picture with Mr. Dean Cain.  Yeah.  And I think it's because he's too pretty.  You know what?  I wasn't going to post a picture of me and Dean Cain.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  It's bad enough, like, when fucking, I posted the David Duchovny one or something.  I got one with David Duchovny.  He's very cute, too.  Look, I still get looks.  I still get looks when I walk around Manhattan, but not like, not like, not... 
[02:14:00]  What kind of looks do you get?  I see them.  I see them.  Probably who's the guy filming the retard with the camera.  Retard.  Yeah, exactly.  But Mr. Cain, you know, that's a whole nother...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the big leagues.  The big leagues.  I like our mature conversation after he leaves.  You know how much pussy Dean Cain must have gotten?  I swear the door wasn't...  It was barely...  It wasn't closed.  Yes!  You know how much pussy... 
[02:14:30]  And it's not lying.  That's exactly what went down.  Yes.  He was good.  He was a good guest.  He was.  I like Dean Cain.  He turned me on the Bigfoot show, too.  I'll be honest.  It's fun.  I'm going to check it out on Spike TV.  Fun viewing is what it is.  I like that fun viewing sometimes.  And you know they're going to have some characters and all that shit, so...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was watching a fun viewing last night.  It was on the Weather Channel, as a matter of fact.  Some of their original programming on plane crashes.  Jesus.  I don't know why I watch these things. 
[02:15:00]  Those are the best plane crash videos.  They weren't like videos.  They were explanations of what happened.  And this was on air collisions.  And they had 3D graphics, representation, CGI, of these situations.  Right.  It was horrifying to watch.  They looked very, very good.  And they're the ones where major airlines are crashing into each other.  And then they had Cessnas crashing.  And this is just a little map of what happened.  But then they have, like, these shots of... 
[02:15:30]  This is an old one from 1960 over New York City.  Wow.  These fucking planes.  Look, people come flying out of the cockpit.  Oh, my God.  They couldn't...  Oh!  Wow.  The fucking bottom engine of, like, a 747 hit the roof of the other one.  Hit the roof of this old crop plane.  And it just fell.  And it crashed.  Did they talk to any of the survivors of this?  Oh, God, no.  Yeah, yeah.  And then that's actual footage.  Yeah, that's footage.  Where's that?  LaGuardia?  It crashed near Idlewild.  And then the United plane was missing half its wing. 
[02:16:00]  It flew for another eight miles and then crashed into, I think, Park Slope.  Did anybody survive that or no?  No.  Okay, they couldn't.  No.  It crashed.  Starting at 7th Avenue.  Here.  And there's witnesses, though.  And a boy, he died later, but he survived the crash and lived for, like, a couple of days.  What about the broad that survived?  The only survivor?  They did that recently on TV.  Oh, that was another crash.  Right, right.  Was that in China?  No, in a murder.  She was a stewardess?  No, the little girl. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, the little girl.  She was a baby or something and survived the plane crash.  And now they're like, 30 years later, she talks for the first time.  This boy got thrown from the wreckage into a pile of snow, but he was so burnt that he died a few days later.  What about the snow?  That didn't put out the...  I would think there was probably a...  You know what happened, though?  It was amazing.  His fucking t-shirt was stiff as a board.  It was crazy.  Fascinating. 
[02:17:00]  Why planes crash, collision course.  That was the one.  It was horrifying.  You watch this and go like...  And then they have some of the...  What is that?  There's footage of...  That's one of the Cessnas that hit an airliner crashing to the ground.  They were doing an interview...  What was that?  ...about gas prices.  And the cameraman turned around and found that.  Happened to catch it.  And then another photographer that was there caught...  This is how this fucking...  This is great animation.  Look at this.  Wham!  Wham!  Oh, that's gotta suck.  The bottom part of the plane came right over the Cessna and hit it. 
[02:17:30]  Hit him.  Yeah, he couldn't see.  They had a visual on the Cessna.  And then they lost him.  And you hear him over the radio communication.  They're going, where's that Cessna?  He goes, I think he went off to our left.  I don't see him anymore.  He had gone below and right in front of the airliners, so they couldn't see him.  The airline is coming down for a landing.  And they're just calling out what they would for a landing.  And then you hear them go, whoa, what the hell?  And then they go, we're going in.  We're going in.  There's this airliner crash, too?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone dead. 
[02:18:00]  Really?  How far at the airport were they?  Very close.  Wow, man.  That sucks.  It's because they were coming in.  It was, yeah, a bad one.  This doesn't happen as much anymore, though, right?  No.  All of these crashes...  And there were two crashes that were very similar with Cessnas and airliners.  And because they were so close together, they made legislation where they need collision  avoidance systems put on these planes.  You always see them down below, though, around the airports.  It's always creepy.  You see them.  You see those smaller planes down there.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Well, they used to not have as much restriction on the planes, and the smaller planes didn't  really have collision avoidance.  But nowadays, a lot of them do, and the radar is so much better, and air traffic control,  believe it or not, is so much better.  Oh, my God.  This 3D animation is terrific.  Aren't they amazing?  Yes.  That's what got me last night watching this.  I'm like, the animation is amazing.  Just clicked the camera on right away and just moved out to the left side.  Flaming Cessna just...  And I'm looking up, and there's something that looks like a comet coming down from the sky. 
[02:19:00]  And that's the still picture the guy got out of the airliner.  Wow.  Yeah.  With the engine on fire, and it was starting to bank to the right.  That's animation.  That looks so amazing.  It was pretty real.  So I knew that the plane had to crash.  It couldn't possibly survive.  Oh, it sucks.  The last words of these guys, the guy in the cockpit was, he goes, we're going in, brace yourself, I love you, Mom. 
[02:19:30]  And then, boom.  How would he say, love you, Mom?  I know.  Maybe the co-pilot's name was Mom.  Poor bastards.  Oh, I love you, Mom.  Look at that.  It's a new year.  Oh, let's have a hug.  I had another show to check out.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It's on, believe it or not, the Weather Channel.  Where's that guy going?  He's flying in the rain.  It's very rainy.  Was this the Mexican airliner?  Yeah, over in the ocean.  Five minutes of fuel, I'm not going to make St. Thomas. 
[02:20:00]  I briefed a crew that we will keep going to St. Croix, but we were going to set up for a possible ditching.  I didn't see this one.  There's some I haven't seen.  They really are amazing, especially when you watch the ones where the pilots actually land the plane after half the fucking wing is gone.  Or half their tail is gone.  All of Captain DeWitt's years of experience are about to come into play.  As he descends, he eyeballs the 10 to 15 foot wave and chooses one. 
[02:20:30]  Knowing full well, he has to land on top of it rather than into it.  All right, that's crazy.  Or the plane could break into pieces.  Wow, he's landing in the ocean?  I would assume it's going to break anyway.  No?  Time of impact, 3.49 p.m.  Wow.  Unlike U.S. Airways Flight 1549, which skimmed across the top of the Hudson River, this plane bobs in and out of the waves.  Wow, would that be scary?  Captain DeWitt says the plane continues to function while in the water. 
[02:21:00]  The aircraft was rolling to the left and was in already a high degree bank, about 30 to 35 degrees.  All I did was start flying it like I would in the air and it rolled out level.  And the minute it rolled out level, I sort of popped to the surface just like a cork.  Well, I gather if, you know, the controls work, I wouldn't work in the water.  Why are the sharks always around?  Fucking sharks are everywhere! 
[02:21:30]  Can't you give them a break?  They're everywhere!  That's gotta suck.  You survived a plane crash.  You survived the plane crash.  You gotta fight off sharks.  That stinks!  What the fuck?  What bastard sharks are?  Hey, we should just fucking kill every shark.  Kill every shark!  Well, that's the Indian Ocean one.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was four bastards.  How many survived the one we just saw?  They said not all, so I'm guessing some died from the...  But when did they give you numbers?  I don't know, there's more than half survived, or...?  They were giving numbers on the one I watched last night. 
[02:22:00]  That's the one where they hijacked a plane, they were hijackers, and the pilot was saying,  look, we're gonna run out of fuel, I can't take you to fucking Australia from, like, the African coast, or wherever it was.  And they just said, no, you keep flying.  And he had to ditch in the water in a 767.  And he just clipped one of the wingtips and cartwheeled.  The biggest problem with this digit is the fact that they catch that left wing.  One can only imagine the pandemonium inside the airplane.  Some people lived, though, right?  Yeah, yeah, some people lived.  They had people right there with boats to get them out, and that helped. 
[02:22:30]  It was quite gentle.  Then there was a hard bump.  The third one was like a 60 mile an hour, worst thing you've ever felt kind of thing.  And then it was getting progressively worse, and the plane was, like, tumbling or something.  I stop watching these when I'm gonna fly soon.  Yeah, sure.  Like, if a trip comes up, and I'm like, oh, I'll be taking a trip soon.  Oh, look what's on.  Why they crash.  Brace yourself.  Oh, nah.  I'll have fun with the tweets later.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I was on the way to the airport.  I was going to the airport when I was listening to the show. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  What's the name of the show again?  It's on the Weather Channel, like you said?  Yeah, what is it called?  It's another one of these fucking...  Why Planes Collide.  Why Planes Collide.  Or Crash.  It was Why Planes Crash, I think, and then that one was called Brace for Collision or something.  I don't know.  It's scary.  Yeah.  But fascinating.  A couple other things.  Because SNL was forced to hire a black cast member, a black woman cast member. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, right.  Literally forced.  They were forced.  Just by the political correctness out there.  By black people.  No, there was people that were saying that there are plenty of funny black women out there.  And they're asking why they haven't had a black woman on the cast since, what, 2007, 2008?  Maya Rudolph.  Yeah, Maya Rudolph.  Since Maya Rudolph left, they haven't had a black woman on SNL.  And people started noticing, and then next thing you know, they...  They start saying that maybe there's another motive why there isn't. 
[02:24:00]  Right, all that shit went down.  Oh, so, you know.  So they went out and hired a black woman to calm everyone down.  Is she the funniest person?  She did an audition.  Oh, yeah.  With just black women.  Just black women.  See, that's amazingly unfair and racist.  Unfair to other people that, you know...  That, yeah.  Imagine your comic.  Could have been, I don't know for sure, but could have been, you know, more qualified and  funnier for the position.  Is she funny, yo?  Yeah, it's also unfair to her, because now she's got the whole world watching her. 
[02:24:30]  Watching her.  That would be funny.  Does she keep it real?  That's what I'm worried about.  I don't know.  I like people that keep it real.  Does that mean...  There's no doubt in my mind they were forced to do this.  Oh, yeah.  It's like affirmative action for comedy, which is, you know, always good.  I think Lorne Michaels has figured it out and knows what's funny.  You know, the show's been on forever.  Yeah, over the years.  So how about you leave the fucking guy alone and let him hire whoever the hell he wants? 
[02:25:00]  But he catered to them, too, so...  At least they picked a looker.  It's pretty hot.  Oh, yeah, you don't like that particular look.  Well, it doesn't tickle my fancy, but I can identify the fact that people that do like  women with more African features would find her attractive.  Well, is this also, too, one of those things where there's certain bits they couldn't do?  Yeah.  If you're SNL and you're covering news stories and you're doing...  You should kind of have somebody that can play almost any part. 
[02:25:30]  And historically, I think SNL has done a shit job.  With black performers, they had Garrett Morris and then...  Chris Rock.  Yes, but he didn't do much with him on that.  Murphy was Dick Ebersole.  That was after Lorne left.  But Chris Rock should have been way bigger on SNL than he was.  Absolutely.  That guy is one of the funniest fucking guys in our generation.  After that, he didn't do a whole lot.  And then I think his special is what really made him like a mainstream star.  And then he blew the fuck up.  I can't believe Jimmy's calling Lorne Michaels a racist.  No, I just don't think they have his black talent that well. 
[02:26:00]  No, no, no.  Honestly, I don't think they ever have.  Yeah.  And again, that's why Eddie Murphy would never go back.  Because I think after Dick Ebersole left and it went back to Lorne...  Wow.  He didn't feel that it was...  No, I don't think it's racist at all.  I just think that...  Like, Tracy did a great job on there.  But, like, Dean Edwards...  I like white people humor.  Oh, okay.  Fucking, um...  What's his name?  They never used Dean Edwards right, who did amazing impressions.  Well, don't forget about the great Tim Meadows.  Tim Meadows, who was on there... 
[02:26:30]  The great Tim Meadows.  ...for longer than many, many people that were on SNL.  Right.  He was on there a long fucking time.  And he got a movie out of it, too.  Yeah, he did.  If you guys don't mind, I gotta take a phone call.  Uh-huh.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, it's Lady Guy.  Jesus Christ.  Just the fucking brake handle gets pulled.  The sparks fly off the train wheels and track as the fucking...  The screeching of a heavy machine that was moving at high speed grinds to a halt. 
[02:27:00]  What?  You were talking about plane crashes.  I figured we would continue the discussion.  Okay, that does tie in.  We're talking to a wide body.  A jumbo twat.  Excuse me.  What?  I want to say one thing straight.  Okay?  What?  Mary is not on Twitter.  That is not her.  We talked to...  Hold on, Lady Di.  It's our show.  We talked to Marion earlier and congratulated her on being on Twitter. 
[02:27:30]  And she said, thank you.  You did not talk to Marion earlier.  She's working right now.  We were talking to her.  Get the audio of her calling the show.  She called earlier.  What's wrong with you?  And we congratulated her for being on Twitter.  On our new Twitter account.  And we were trying to help her out because so far all she's tweeting is, hi, Anthony.  Hi, Opie.  Yeah.  It's her picture.  She said, you know, oh, that's not me.  Wink, wink.  Right.  All right.  Listen.  She just called me up and she told me that she's not on Twitter to let you guys know. 
[02:28:00]  I am on Twitter.  I already know that.  But she's not on Twitter.  She knows she's on Twitter.  Oh, way to make it about yourself.  Oh, my God.  They got pictures from the Internet, whoever it was.  That is not her.  Nope.  Yeah.  I've never seen those pictures on the Internet before.  Only, you know...  I have.  I have.  Those are personal pictures, obviously.  And she picked one of the better ones and she's on Twitter.  We all know it.  Lady Di, is this your coffee break?  Is this your coffee break from work?  Oh, yeah.  It's my coffee break from television.  That's what it is right now.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:28:30]  And by coffee, it's beer.  I bet she watches Search without the A.  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to let you know that.  What kind of TV are you watching this morning?  What do you got on?  Kelly and Michael.  Oh, God.  Kelly and Michael.  I've had Michael on.  He's a good guy, but...  Yeah, I don't know.  What beer are you drinking?  Natty Ice?  Natty Ice?  What are you drinking?  I just popped open my first beer.  First beer?  Be honest.  I woke up a little late.  Huh? 
[02:29:00]  I woke up a little late.  She just...  Boy, I wonder if that pisses off a lot of people that work their asses off.  Woke up a little late, so I'm only onto my first Natty Ice.  It's 9.40.  You'll have to forgive me.  I've only had time for one beverage.  You'll have to forgive me.  I thought this was waking up early for you, you drunk.  You know, Lady Di, you know, I try to support you.  You're a drunken slob.  Jim, please.  You're a drunken...  You're a drunken sot. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  I just put in another application yesterday.  Oh, where?  Today.  She says...  I'd rather not say.  It's a restaurant.  That's all I'm going to tell you.  Is it Burger King?  McDonald's?  I don't know.  Something like that.  Is it a fast food restaurant or a restaurant?  Yeah, it's kind of like fast food.  Yes, it is.  Wait, kind of like...  Could you fucking just say...  And why wouldn't you say...  Is it Roy Roger?  Roy Roger.  That's Jim Fortin, but I can't...  Ah, that's great. 
[02:30:00]  I love it.  What?  I have to go.  I gotta go.  Is it Jacques and Zbox?  Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Don't go.  Why do you have to go?  You got nothing to do.  You cracked a beer and you got TV.  I have to go.  I just want to let you go.  Why?  Why do you have to go?  What?  How dare you hang up on us?  You fucking fat bitch.  She hung up on us now.  She hung up on us?  What's up with these two?  She don't do that.  These two with this attitude.  In a power trip.  There's Marion who's on Twitter and Lady Di who's saying Marion's not on Twitter.  She's not. 
[02:30:30]  She's got an application at a fast food place.  Where were we?  So, all right, SNL.  Jimmy's got a better angle on it.  I just, it just comes out of nowhere that they're, you know, hiring this black female comic for SNL.  Is she a stand-up or is she a sketch?  I don't know her, but she must be a sketch horror.  I think she comes from Upright.  Yeah, she's from UCB and she's done stand-up, but she's, like, got tons of improv experience.  But this all comes from all the discussion that has been going down for the last couple months. 
[02:31:00]  So, sucks for her.  But Lauren should have said, look, all right, we'll look into it and we'll get back to you.  Not, like, quickly try to find somebody, which it seems like they did.  They did.  We'll see what she's like.  When's our first show?  I don't know.  I bet it's a Saturday.  Is SNL still not good?  Where are we at with SNL?  It goes good, it goes bad.  I heard it was really funny this year. 
[02:31:30]  It's getting good again?  I have not watched it, but I've heard it was.  Someone said it got really good.  I've seen a few funny bits.  Yeah, I heard Lady Gaga was good on it and, like, a lot of the hosts have been funny.  Did we do the baby bit on this show?  Yeah, it was hilarious.  Yeah, that's funny.  He's funny.  Bobby Moynihan is funny.  Who?  Bobby Moynihan.  Bobby Moynihan.  He's a fan of the show.  Funny cast member of SNL.  Who is he?  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  He's a fan of the show.  He's a fan of the show.  An actual fan.  Yes.  You know, I know he's a fan of the show because he found the bit where you were bashing him 
[02:32:00]  on YouTube.  Oh.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, that guy.  Does he want to come in, or?  Yes.  Hey, drunk uncle.  Oof.  All right.  I've seen the drunk uncle bit on the show in context of...  Don't say that you laughed.  I did.  I will say I did.  It was just that bit that when he did it on the awards show there, it was...  The only time you see drunk uncle is when you're talking to your nephew. 
[02:32:30]  I think the problem...  I think the problem with drunk uncle, it goes on a little too long.  Like SNL likes to do that at times.  They don't know when to say, okay.  I like the girl that does the Jewish David kid.  That's hilarious.  You know what?  The Hanukkah.  That's hilarious.  Hanukkah.  Yeah, yeah.  Have we played a little...  Can I hear a little of that?  Yeah, if you want.  My brother.  Yeah, that's kind of funny. 
[02:33:00]  That's a funny bit.  It's a girl that does that.  Yes.  She's...  This bit is hilarious.  Girl.  Jacob.  Jacob, right?  Right.  I always say David because I think...  Sorry, we're not able to load.  Oh.  Sorry, I'm not able to load.  You think of our David?  I think of our David because...  Who's this guy?  Very Jewish.  Seth Meyers.  Seth Meyers.  I was just saying that.  He's a big star.  Jacob.  That's a curly Jewish. 
[02:33:30]  My dad said to give you this ointment for your athlete's foot.  Okay, well.  Thank you, Jacob.  So, did you have a good Hanukkah this year?  The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah has many traditions.  One of the oldest is playing the game of dreidel.  There's gambling, high stakes, a spinning top, pretty fun.  But it ain't no Xbox 360. 
[02:34:00]  I'm just sitting there smiling awkwardly.  You don't have to come out here and make a rehearsed speech like at your bar mitzvah.  You know, we can just talk like buddies.  He turns the page.  It's the sticks with the script.  And spins the dreidel to win money, chocolate gelt, or sometimes raisins.  My family used to play for peanut shells until my cousin Jeremy got an allergy and we had to go to the emergency room.  Oh, that's...  It's very visual. 
[02:34:30]  Like, the facial expressions this chick makes is fucking hilarious.  Are you okay?  I think she's the same one that does Miley Cyrus.  Yes, yes.  Each night of Hanukkah, we light the menorah to remember the miracle of the oil that lasted for eight days.  Which is how long my brother Ethan was grounded for calling his social studies teacher a fascist.  She's excited.  Yeah, very excited. 
[02:35:00]  But seriously, Ethan, even though you threw my Tivas into the pool at Boca Raton, you'll always be my old brother.  All this Jewish stuff.  But it ain't no Xbox 360!  All excited.  Yeah, that was a pretty good bit.  She's got to be Jewish, though, right?  I think so.  Pop, probably.  I don't know if you're allowed to do that bit unless you're Jewish.  Unless you're Jewish?  Yeah.  You can goof on Jews pretty easily in this day and age without really any repercussions, as long as it's not really fair. 
[02:35:30]  They finally have a sense of humor?  Well, you know.  Why are you mad at the Jews now?  Yeah, right?  She's an angry person today.  I mean...  It goes back to caddying.  Christians are the one you can just shit on.  Yep.  And you can't get in trouble, no matter how much you try.  You could have fucking sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And you will not get...  Yeah, for the most part. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Christians.  Catholics.  Then Jews.  You can make fun of the Jews, pretty much.  Used to be able to make fun of the gay.  Up until probably a good 10 years ago.  Maybe 15 years ago.  Yeah.  Now...  Well, didn't a recent Toronto shockery jockery just get thrown out on his ass for some gay?  A little gay.  One of the jokes was hilarious. 
[02:36:30]  I got lazy yesterday.  And a lot of people tweeted me that.  And I really don't know what's happened.  I hear he was, like, really popular in Toronto, and they kicked him off the air.  They were talking about a trial between two gay guys, or a gay guy might have killed another  gay guy, and something.  But then he was...  They talked about the sentencing of the gay guy.  And he said...  One guy goes, he was sentenced to 10 years of awesome.  I read that like that.  Wait, he got fired for that?  That's a funny fucking joke, man.  Come on. 
[02:37:00]  He's in prison.  What babies they are.  That's a funny line.  I thought it was very funny.  10 years of awesome.  Oh, that's funny.  That could be the only joke.  That could be the only joke.  No, no.  I think they had gone on about other gay things.  Do we have the audio clip of what got him in trouble?  I don't think so.  Mm-mm.  No.  God, see, you just don't know what's going to be the thing.  You just don't.  Right.  They didn't go into work yesterday or whatever day this happened and went,  all right, today is going to be the day we're going to get fired.  I bet you they completely assumed they were all right with what they were saying. 
[02:37:30]  That's got to suck.  Well, we know it sucks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know how much it sucks.  We just came back from that.  Luckily.  Yeah.  That's why if you're going to do jokes like that, you either do them on satellite radio  or you do them on a podcast that airs six months after you do it.  What?  Nothing.  Oh, no.  Sometimes you try to promote something on a podcast, you think it'll be up in a fairly  timely fashion, and it comes out five months later.  Oh, no.  What's this about?  This podcast.  No, I just did a bunch of podcasts to promote. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I understand that it's not always going to come out that week.  Wait, you were on podcasts to promote gigs?  To promote my special.  Special, yeah.  And I did The Nerdist, and I knew it might not come out that week, but I taped it in August,  and it just came out, like, this week, and people are, and I've been asking my fucking  cocksucker manager, is this, people are saying it's not out, it's not out, it's not out,  and he's like, oh, yeah, no, Jim, I think he's out, I think he's out.  So I'm just like, you know.  Oh.  I don't expect to. 
[02:38:30]  Well, I would expect more than from August.  I mean, from fucking August.  Wow, Jesus Christ.  But.  It's not quite topical at this point.  Silver line and good news, this week, Jim Norton is on The Nerdist Podcast.  Hey, there you go.  Big podcast.  Way to go.  It's a huge podcast, Jim.  Yeah, I know, I know.  We've talked to the guy on our show many times.  I know, I remember.  It's cool.  Oh.  Hey, what's that?  I love Jimmy.  Jimmy is passionate.  Passionate.  Well, it's like, you know, if we had people on the radio show and then just delayed their 
[02:39:00]  interview by five months.  Could you imagine?  Long beyond where.  They're promoting something.  Right, right, right.  They should have just said no to me.  Why the five month delay?  Because they probably didn't want me on and we were having, so I just asked him directly  and he was nice about it, but it was probably just to be polite to get it in there.  Do you think Dean Cain would mind if we just had recorded that and then played it after the  final episode of the show aired and then we just fucking played?  Did he ask you to be on?  No, we requested it, but my publicist had said, like, well, they usually book way in advance, 
[02:39:30]  so I figured she was getting stonewalled by them, so I figured I would just ask.  And if he said no, he said no.  I'm glad, like, little ones like Rogan at least aired me.  Yeah.  That, you know.  Yeah.  Podcasts, like, I think they're kind of like radio.  They're timely.  Don't you think?  Well, apparently he...  What did he say to you?  No, he explained before the pod...  I didn't hear it, but he explained before the podcast that, look, you know, sometimes  these things get shuffled because some of them are timely. 
[02:40:00]  Timely?  Yeah.  But how many podcasts are you doing in one day that it's...  Right, right.  You've got to wait five months to finally get it out.  Five months backlogged.  They might have just squeezed us in.  Shit.  That's like something we did in August airing now.  Yeah, I can understand if it was...  Again, it didn't have to be that week because I know they probably shoehorned me in to do  me a favor.  Yeah, but within a couple weeks...  Wow.  That's weird.  Yeah, from August to January 6th. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  We won't have him on anymore.  Fuck him.  We could tape him.  Fuck that.  Five months later, we'll put him on.  That's right.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Now that we're a media destination, we can't put up with this shit.  Yes, we sure are.  Cool.  Oh, boy.  See, if you don't want me on your podcast, just say no.  Yeah.  What if he wanted you on his podcast in January? 
[02:41:00]  That's true.  Well, then I guess that would be good when you're doing press in August.  All right.  I knew it.  I'm more annoyed at my management, who I asked fucking time and time again.  And nobody knows what they're doing.  I got to fire everybody that works for you.  Nobody fucking knows what they're doing.  Time for a purge.  Jesus Christ.  You've been saying that for a while.  Maybe you just fucking purge him out.  Yeah, I think you're right.  Like Stalin used to do it. 
[02:41:30]  Just fucking shoot him.  Jeez Louise.  Maybe I'm not the right fit for that.  No, you put you on.  Look, devil's advocate.  It's fucking six months after I needed it.  Put me on.  So what?  What you're saying?  But it still has value if he doesn't want you.  Jimmy, it still has value.  You're still on a huge podcast.  I don't care about that. 
[02:42:00]  I really don't.  I mean, I've been on a huge podcast.  I've been on fucking Corolla.  And I've been on Joe Rogan.  And I've been on Kevin Smith.  And those are all huge podcasts.  I mean, I appreciate that.  Sure.  I'm not saying it won't help.  I don't like it.  But you were doing that particular podcast to promote gigs.  I was doing all of them to promote my special.  And I understand that they shoehorned me in.  But five months later.  But the special still did very well.  It did.  It did incredibly well.  But that really is.  If they didn't enjoy my appearance, I get it.  But you're also hitting a whole bunch of people that don't listen to us with the nerdist. 
[02:42:30]  I understand.  And, you know, I'm not a mother.  We share audience, but not a lot, I bet.  I bet there's a lot of people that we could grab from there.  They have the right to do what they see fit.  Maybe I just wasn't right for their...  Oh, fuck them.  Listen to Jonathan.  I had no idea who Jim Norton was before this, but I'm so happy that you had him on this show.  His energy was amazing, and he was so funny.  That's nice.  Give us a fuck.  All right, then?  Okay.  I mean, really?  All right? 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Okay.  To myself.  It's still exposure.  I know that, but it's like, you understand the point I'm making.  It's like, we say it all the time.  It's like, we try to take care of people on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, no one really takes care of us.  They don't.  We know that.  I got a short list of people.  You know who did?  Rogan.  Rogan always.  When you went out there, he had you on.  When I needed to go out there, he's like...  Had me on.  I didn't even land, and word was out that I was going out. 
[02:43:30]  I was in LA, and I checked my phone, and Rogan goes, I hear you're in town.  I'm like, well, okay.  I just landed, because I'd love to have you on the podcast.  That made me feel great.  Yeah.  I didn't ask or anything.  I didn't even put out feelers.  I think because of some of my Twitter pictures or something.  He goes, oh, fuck.  You're in LA.  Come do the show.  I'm like, really?  He's a fucking true man.  He's a...  He's just a fucking...  He's an honest, trustworthy, loyal, real guy.  It was my fault, though.  He's so rare.  Because in all honesty, my publicist was kind of like... 
[02:44:00]  You know, all the publicists, they...  Well, it's kind of...  I guess they were saying, kind of, well, not right now.  So maybe he really was just trying to be polite and have...  You know what I mean?  It's almost like, I can't motherfuck the guy, because he did have me on.  He can.  And he might have...  But no, it wouldn't be right, because he might have been saying to my publicist, well,  we don't have time right now.  And maybe I just put him on the spot by texting him, which wasn't intentional.  Oh, boy.  So, I won't do that again.  Oh, no.  But...  All right.  That podcast does numbers, though. 
[02:44:30]  Sure.  You know.  Great.  Be good for the on-demand.  Got it.  We'll be, I mean...  No, we'll be.  Got it.  And future projects.  You probably got a few fans out of that.  A few new fans.  Someone thinks it's 10.30, I guess.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  We're going to do the Chris Cuomo-Dennis Rodman exchange next.  All right.  We got a lot to say about that, Dennis Rodman. 
[02:45:00]  I want to hear of that.  And, yeah.  Stay there.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, the guys learn old habits die hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man?  You feel all right?  Yeah.  You seem sick or something.  I'm just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise.  You all right?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem.  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Or now it's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha!  Yeah!  Fucking!  Where's Gary?  Fuck him! 
[02:46:00]  Laugh, love, and learn.  You're not going to drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Fuck you, I'm fine.  The Opie and Anthony show is back on Sirius XM.  Best news ever. 
[02:46:30]  I think that's a good rule of thumb.  Yeah, I think so.  Anyone check out Jimmy?  Did he jump through the ice glazed window?  Yeah, we got ice on the inside of these windows here.  Pretty wild.  Why?  It's no frozen t-shirt, but it's pretty wild.  It's our own experiment.  That's right.  Well, no, we had nothing to do with it.  That's the beauty of it.  It just happened.  Anyway, remember that story about Kim Jong-un? 
[02:47:00]  You remember?  Fed his uncle to the dogs?  Yeah, that came out that he executed his uncle and then fed him to a bunch of hungry dogs.  Right.  Well, apparently it's false.  The uncle's dead.  Yeah.  But he wasn't fed to dogs.  And he was executed by Kim Jong-un.  And he was.  Yeah, but just not with the dog thing.  And I guess the rumor was started by a Chinese satirist.  Like the onion. 
[02:47:30]  Except in Chinese.  Is that a guy that makes saddles?  We discussed this before the show.  So, how do you know when a Chinese guy.  Thank you.  How do you know when a Chinese guy is being satirical?  Yes.  That is impossible.  It's a motherfucker to even try to learn that language.  And now you've got to know when he's being satirical.  It's like when people read the onion. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  Here.  And then post it as real news.  They're like, oh my god, I can't believe that.  Right.  And for some people it's hard enough to read in English and the onion.  Right.  But I don't even know what it would be like to try to decipher a Chinese article that is meant as parody.  Is one of those Chinese rooftops just slightly askew and that's where...  The little squiggly or the rooftop?  The rooftop.  Okay, the rooftop.  They're the rooftop language, right?  What about the three lines under the rooftop?  Well, those are like floors, I thought.  I always thought of them as floors.  What if one's tilted a little? 
[02:48:30]  That might mean...  That's what I'm saying.  Then he's being...  LOL.  Oh, that might be an LOL.  Yeah, yeah, something.  That rooftop language is rough, man.  That's hard to learn.  You know that a lot of kid my son's age are already taking Chinese.  I'm like, no.  None of that Rosetta Stone stuff?  I'll allow him to learn some dirty Spanish.  That's about it.  Holy shit.  Roland knows.  Yeah.  Yes.  Cabrones putos.  Oh, that is dirty.  Because I got a cleaning lady, and I tell her every time that I took six years of Spanish, 
[02:49:00]  but I speak the proper Spanish they taught you in class, and they laugh at me.  Believe me, if you yell at them, they know what the fuck you want.  Right.  That's how I operate.  Or you just raise your hand and go, ah?  Yeah.  Or fucking just a smack across the face, and then you point at the dirt.  They know.  Clean it up.  They speak more dirty Spanish than proper Spanish, right?  Oh, they do.  Out there in the streets.  Or if they know you don't know Spanish, they talk shit behind your back.  Oh, I know enough.  Yeah.  I know when the cleaning lady's talking about me.  Yeah, ah, El Jefe. 
[02:49:30]  What is El Jefe?  The boss.  The king.  The boobies.  Oh, nice.  El Jefe.  I like being El Jefe.  Or if they had your day, well, El Jefe was mad.  Oh, then they use it like you're an asshole.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, fuck that.  So, Dennis Rodman is over there in North Korea again.  I hope he gets fed to the fucking dog.  I hope this is such a work.  Yeah.  By Kim Jong-un.  And now here's the final, the turn finally, and they feed Dennis Rodman to the dogs.  He's a fucking diplomat. 
[02:50:00]  He's Mr. Fucking North Korea.  He's a loser is what he is.  If you've ever seen him on any of these sober house slash rehab shows, Dennis Rodman is a fucking loser.  They're a raging alcoholic with major issues.  There's one thing to travel to a country like Vice does it a lot where you travel and do an expose on a country with a tyrannical government or some kind of bunch of loose cannon fucking warlords or whatever.  Right.  But it's another thing to travel to where there's a tyrannical leader that you're now calling one of your best friends and you're pretty much a propaganda machine for this fucking maniac. 
[02:50:30]  And it's all because Rodman is loving the attention because no one has really given a fuck about him since Jordan decided to retire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He loves the attention.  No one gives a fuck.  And then now he's got these other NBA guys, ex-NBA guys, and they're all just pathetic losers.  I think it was CNN.  They went player to player and they're all like just losers. 
[02:51:00]  Really?  They got nothing going on.  So that's why Rodman was able to get these guys together to go with him.  And what are they going to be playing basketball over there?  I guess.  Is that what they're going to do?  Is that a goodwill game?  Goodwill.  Goodwill game.  In North Korea.  One of the players, he makes educational porn videos with his wife now because his NBA career is a bust.  Then he got Kenny Anderson.  They said, like, he went through something like $63 million.  He has, like, no money.  Damn.  And who else they got on the team? 
[02:51:30]  Doug Christie, Kenny Anderson, Charles Smith, I think.  Oh, wow.  I think they got Charles Smith and a couple others.  But all guys that desperately need, you know, the attention are a couple bucks in their pocket.  So I guess Rodman was on CNN this morning.  And Chris Cuomo and him went at it, which I'm happy to hear.  Last time we checked in with Chris Cuomo, what did he do?  We were all, like, disgusted.  A racial discussion about the knockout game. 
[02:52:00]  And he didn't want to say something about people.  I forget.  I'm sure there was a good reason to hate him.  Yeah, we were very disappointed.  He took a horrible angle on something.  But let's see how he handled Rodman this morning.  You do have a relationship with this man.  You've said it many times.  We've seen it demonstrated for whatever reason.  Are you going to take an opportunity, if you get it, to speak up for the family of Kenneth Bay and to say, let us know why this man is being held. 
[02:52:30]  That this is wrong.  That he is sick.  If you can help, Dennis, will you take the opportunity?  Is a dog eating in the background?  The one thing about politics.  Pause.  Kenneth Bay did one thing.  Kenneth Bay what?  What the fuck is this maniac saying?  He's in bad shape.  He's got a cigar.  Like, he's a fucking asshole.  He sounds like one of those no-smoking ads that they're putting on TV. 
[02:53:00]  And they're holding Kenneth Bay.  Yeah.  North Korea.  So how about you try to do something right here?  Damn.  If he's your pal, then get him to release Kenneth Bay.  Now he's going to play it down like, hey, the politics is one thing.  That's what people do.  Right.  You know, that's not me, though.  I like, I bet, you know what he does?  Why he's not going to say anything?  I bet he keeps it real.  Yeah.  He's not going to say anything because he's scared shitless that that could be the big turn.  That'd be great if there's just some fucking Koreans out, just off the frame with machine guns going. 
[02:53:30]  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  That this is wrong, that he is sick.  If you can help Dennis, will you take the opportunity?  I know.  Watch this.  I know, like, the one thing about politics.  Kenneth Bay did one thing.  If you understand.  I got it, I got it.  If you understand what Kenneth Bay did.  Yeah.  Do you understand what he did?  What did he do?  You tell me.  In this country.  You tell me, what did he do?  No, no, no, no. 
[02:54:00]  You tell me.  You tell me.  Why is he held captive?  They haven't released any charges.  They haven't released any reasons.  Listen.  I would love to speak on this.  Go ahead.  You know.  You got ten guys here.  Ten guys here.  That have left their families.  Left their damn families.  To help this country.  Pause.  In this force. 
[02:54:30]  So much going on here.  Holy shit.  First of all, I truly believe he doesn't even know the Kenneth Bay situation.  I think he's brain damaged.  Right.  I think he's got brain damage.  And secondly, look at the players.  They all look ridiculously pathetic and sad.  They look like hostages.  They really do.  They have their heads down.  They're like, uh.  Right.  We have to do this.  We have nothing else going on in our lives.  He reminds me of Jane Fonda.  Uh-huh.  Not as lucid. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  But, uh, in fucking North Vietnamese soldiers.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just speaking for the enemy.  Right.  He might not know the Kenneth Bay situation.  He just probably just gave him bullshit.  He's loving the attention.  That's all this is about.  What is Kenneth Bay over there for?  They haven't released charges, I guess.  But I assume it's some type of espionage.  That's usually the big thing over there.  A little espionage.  They don't like espionage.  I heard he walked over a line that he wasn't supposed to.  Is that it?  Yeah, it was like a line. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, God.  Was it one of those things?  Yeah, he walked over, I think.  Oh, boy.  And went oops.  And he, like, walked back over the line.  You're no sin of me.  But it was too late.  Oh, shit.  It was too late.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Go ahead, Rodman.  Got ten guys.  All these guys here.  Do anyone understand that?  We do.  And we appreciate that.  And we wish them well with cultural exchange.  No, no, no, no.  I'm just the same.  No, I don't hear a s***.  I'm the rassass what the hell you think.  I'm sending you. 
[02:56:00]  Look at these guys here.  Look at them.  Yeah, but Dennis, don't put it on them.  They died.  Don't use them as an excuse for the behavior that you're putting on yourself.  They came here.  They came here.  You just basically were saying that Kenneth Bade did something wrong.  We don't even know what the charges are.  Don't use these guys as a shield for you, Dennis.  You can't use them.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  I got it.  Let me do this.  Dennis is really a douche.  I'm going to tell you one thing.  People around the world.  Around the world.  I'm going to do one thing. 
[02:56:30]  You're a guy behind a mic right now.  We are the guys here doing one thing.  We have to go back to America.  Pause this real quick.  I know what Dennis is saying.  What is he saying?  You're going to get us killed.  Shut up.  You're going to get us killed.  He always has a great angle at stuff.  Stop.  We ixnay on Bay NFK.  We heard you.  There's a man there with a gun.  We're in a communist nation. 
[02:57:00]  That's funny.  With Rotman's voice in delivery, though?  Yeah, yeah.  Fast forward another year.  He's going to be some weird king over there.  You know what I mean?  They'll be worshipping him.  They're going to just be worshipping him wherever he goes.  Keep going.  We have to go back to America and take the abuse.  Do you have to take the abuse?  What are we going to take?  This is your choice.  Let me know. 
[02:57:30]  It's a who gives a fucking nonsense game.  One day, one day, this door is going to open because guys here, all of us, Christy, Ben, Dennis, Charles, all these guys, I mean, everybody here,  if we could just open the door just a little bit for people to come here and be taken prisoners. 
[02:58:00]  And Dennis makes a great point.  There are other Americans here on this trip.  You have to understand that we're not alone.  We're in passage with about 50 people.  There are other Americans that have been to Korea in and out of Korea.  They're here on a tour.  They're here with us.  We interacted with them as well.  Now, the key is you can date Dennis or any of us into a political conversation.  That's not my intention.  But that's not.  Charles, it's not my intention. 
[02:58:30]  Shut up, Chris.  It really is.  Shut up.  Please.  If that's not your intention, if that's not your intention, we've said numerous times that we're not here for any political aspects.  We're not here to talk politics.  So outside of that, just being there is political.  So you can't even say that to get us into politics.  That's not what we're here.  Every man sitting here understands that.  Charles, I understand it as well.  I wish you good luck with the cultural exchange. 
[02:59:00]  But, you know, the issues that are at play.  Good luck with the game.  I but Charles is saying that this is like what Dennis and them are trying to do is whatever, get attention.  But they're also trying to, hey, they're trying to make some kind of a connection with a country that nobody in America has any connection with.  And this is some sort of a cultural in.  It may be stupid or whatever, but there's Americans over there doing something that the country is paying attention to.  So Charles, I think, said it much better than Dennis said it.  In like fucking 20 seconds. 
[02:59:30]  And Chris is just trying to bait him.  It's like, Chris, these are a bunch of basketball players over there playing basketball.  Nope.  You know what it is.  So don't act like, why aren't you saying this?  Because, you know, you're in a communist nation.  What do you expect them to do?  Just scream at Kim Jong-un?  Come on.  Don't be dumb.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  It's not like Joe Biden's over there or our fucking secretary of state over there.  Well, that's just it.  He also knows that Rodman's just grandstanding.  He's just a fucking loser. 
[03:00:00]  He's a bit of an ass.  Yeah, he's just a fucking dick.  Fuck Dennis Rodman.  Yeah.  You're not doing anything of significance.  In some weird way, you and Kim Jong-un are pals and you're loving the attention.  Period.  And again, pals with a guy that does nothing but, you know, threaten the world.  Keeps his entire country down.  Keeps his country down.  Threatens the world with nuclear capabilities until he gets paid off extortion money.  It's just, you know, but then you think, I mean, we've gone to countries for the Olympics 
[03:00:30]  that have been, you know, horrible nations.  Saudi Arabia we're still friends with and fucking we have relations with China and all  these shitty, awful.  How come we don't tell China don't have relations with North?  Oh, that's right.  Because we know to shut the fuck up and let China do what it wants.  We complain a little bit about their air quality.  But, you know, much easier to have an embargo against Cuba than it is against China. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  It is all pretty hypocritical.  Yeah.  It's silly.  What are you going to do?  He wants to go over there.  Let him go over there.  We'll go do.  That's what I say.  We'll go do.  What are you going to do?  I got the dentist again today.  Ouch.  Fucking back to the goddamn dentist.  Is it helping?  I mean, like, are you?  Oh, yeah.  It obviously is helping.  Look at the falsies.  He looks great.  No, they're not, and I haven't had anything cosmetic done to the front teeth or anything  yet.  Other than semen.  I mean, yeah.  I'm trying to bleach my teeth.  A good old-fashioned whitewash. 
[03:01:30]  I get the temporary air gets replaced with permanent air.  And then I'm going to get some laminants.  But they're fucking thin little fucking thing that just cover exactly where the teeth are.  They're not caps.  They're not these big, white, bright things.  It's going to make it tough to talk, though.  No, it's not.  I have been and always shall be your friend, Captain Kirk. 
[03:02:00]  Be able to do an accurate Howard Stern impression.  Who?  No, I'll be able to...  There's a little whistle in that fucking voice these days.  I'll be able to zip through...  Media Destination!  Who's that?  Hi.  That's Gillian Jacobs from Community.  Oh, that's right.  Why isn't she on our show?  What happened?  Why do you think?  Did we say no?  What did we say to her?  Yes.  Oh. 
[03:02:30]  Did we say she's run her course with us?  I don't know.  No, we didn't say no to her.  She's very cute, I always thought.  She's always a pretty good guest.  Yeah, she's nice.  We always had fun with her on the show.  Yeah, but you don't say any of these things when she's being pitched.  Who's that egghead?  Egg head.  Look at his egg head.  What else noticed we haven't seen Gary since?  I just saw him today for the first time.  Oh, did you?  He's so pleasant now.  It's hilarious.  Oh, no.  It's amazing.  What made you think of Gary? 
[03:03:00]  Egg head.  Egg head.  Ah, shit.  Well, but you've got to shave everything, and then you're not an egg head.  Right, right.  Egg head as much.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Horseshoe bald.  Oh, these hallowed hallways of shit.  Well, it's getting better.  You saw the stonework.  It looks very impressive in the lobby.  I do like that lobby.  It's very mausoleum looking.  It gives me a little skip of my step.  Does it?  When I see that, like, ooh, we're at a fancy place. 
[03:03:30]  You see the new green room?  No.  It's way fancier.  Oh, cool.  Are we allowed to use that?  I mean, yeah.  I wouldn't.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Sure we are.  But we're a media destination.  Like, where did Dean Cain hang out before his great interview with us, considering we're  now a media destination in 2014?  In the hall.  In the hallway.  Oh.  Where?  Outside the studio.  Yeah.  Well, you always want to be close to your destination, don't you?  You don't want to travel too far to your media destination.  He was in the hallway. 
[03:04:00]  Do we have anything for him to pass the time?  Well, we might have, but...  Amenities?  Any amenities?  Well...  What did he have?  We don't have anything for him.  So we honestly just sat him next to that garbage pail?  Was there a chair?  He didn't want any pretzels.  He didn't want any pretzels.  Next to the garbage pail?  I said hi to him, because I haven't seen him in a while.  He was sitting next to a garbage pail.  I'm sure when he goes on the Today Show, he has to sit next to their garbage pail as well.  Our guests literally have to sit next to a fucking garbage pail. 
[03:04:30]  Yes.  He passed the time talking to Roland.  It was fine.  Oh, that's good.  A little distraction from the smell coming from the garbage pail.  Wow.  And the reason we don't have anything to give the guests is because you go on the air and  say they suck.  We had nice Beats Jay-Z headphones to give.  Did we?  Yeah.  We would have, but...  What happened?  You guys said that they suck.  They suck for radio.  Oh, I liked them.  You can't, I mean...  I did.  I liked them.  I didn't even get a pair.  Oh, they didn't listen to me.  I had one, and then someone stole them from me. 
[03:05:00]  No, no, no.  You specifically...  They don't work as far as trying to do a radio show, but they're amazing for, you know,  watching movies and music.  No one that's good in radio would even use them during the day for...  Hell fucking no.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I see.  I see the big B on the side of your face.  I see the big B on the side of your face.  Oh, that's...  Oh, wow.  See, now I...  Well...  It's going to really leave a mark.  You've got garbage can guests.  Garbage can guests.  So, there you go. 
[03:05:30]  We should just get, like, an Oscar the Grouch puppet to make them feel better.  They just pop out of the garbage pail and have a little fun.  We'll paint E-Rock green.  Oh, are those mine?  Oh, see, I like the Beats, but for, like, home.  I'll use them, like, at home for something.  See?  Oh, those are mine.  Look, it says, and...  Wow.  Beats Pro.  Yeah, they're not...  Yeah, motherfuckers.  Where's mine?  You said you wanted to give them to homeless people.  Oh, man.  But where are they?  How'd that work out?  You got them.  You took...  You went home with them.  Did you? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  They're not here.  Mine are still here.  Yes, Jim is still here.  Can I have Jimmy's?  I'm taking mine home.  No, I want mine.  I'm listening to some tunes.  Listen to the tunes.  Some music.  Some nice tunes.  All right, let's get the Beats people back on our side.  I think we can turn that one around.  You...  I think we can turn that one around.  Went out of your way to build that bridge back.  Yeah.  You blew that bridge up, like, first day.  Because I tried them, and maybe because my hearing's all fucked up from doing this first  for so long.  You didn't say, these don't work for me or for my purpose, but I see them as good product. 
[03:06:30]  You know what?  As musical headphones, they can't be beat.  But I'll tell you, doing a radio show with them, they were a little weighty.  A little too busy.  Heavy bottom end.  Yeah.  Heavy bottom end on them.  Yeah, but you're quoted as not saying...  I mean, you might have said that, but you also said, oh, these fucking things suck.  Oh, see?  That's just another way of saying...  Yeah, how about, like, you said, like...  I was frustrated, because...  I don't want these pieces of shit.  Oh.  You know, it's like... 
[03:07:00]  Because, you know, the real thing happening here is I'm losing my hearing, so I had to  fucking lash out at something.  Oh, man.  I'm starting to see, like, people with hearing aids going...  You know what?  I can do that.  You've done it too, right?  I did.  I did.  Like, yeah, yeah.  Because this is the curse of doing radio all these years.  There was a relative of mine, and they have, like, a hearing aid thing.  I'm like, you know, that's not too bad.  It was like nothing, and...  The ones where it's a little wire that pops out, it looks like it's just...  A little wire.  It looks like a ear hair?  It's like a gray hair or something. 
[03:07:30]  And I'm like, ah, you know.  Then I've seen the ones where it just completely covers the ear.  I'm like, oh, but it's flesh-colored.  Maybe it flesh-colors the ear.  Really?  Can't you get an implant?  Dude, my tits have to do with a jimmy.  Come on.  It'll be fun to just squeeze your...  If you're not hearing anything, you want to squeeze a big tit on the side of your head.  But how about that Rush Limbaugh guy?  That's for a different thing, though.  That's for your cochlea.  My worst nightmare is going to a restaurant, big table, all family members.  Loud.  Because you know there's going to be a lot of talking and catching up, and I'm just like... 
[03:08:00]  And the waitress is...  Fucking lost.  The waitress is going off on specials, and I'm just, like, nodding.  That's when...  And if it's a busy place, forget it.  I hear all sorts of shit, but you can't focus on, you know, individual voices because of  whatever the fuck we've done with this radio career.  I'm going to get a big, a gnarly, twisted tin horn, and just shove it in my ear, and to  everyone, just go, eh, eh.  Like, I could have a conversation with the people to my right and to my left, across the 
[03:08:30]  table, even, nope.  Can't you have one...  Like, I always leave one headphone on and one off.  I like to hear...  At a restaurant.  Yes, always.  It's so bizarre.  They're like, why do you have earmuffs on, sir?  I'm like, because my ears get cold in increments.  Like, I like to have the room sound.  Like, I like to hear room sound.  I can't...  I feel...  Yeah, this isn't bad.  Talking with the most...  Maybe I should have done this 30 years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe if you did that a while ago.  I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  I haven't had my ears cleaned out, because I'm hoping that's, like, saving some shit in 
[03:09:00]  there.  Ant, you want to loan them that?  Oh.  That, combined with the horrible tinnitus, it just makes...  I don't have that yet.  Oh, do I have...  Thank God.  I have fucking...  At night, it's quiet.  I might as well strap two seashells to my ears.  Really?  That's what I hear all the time.  That's from your band shit, because...  When I go to sleep, there's nothing, man.  I need the TV on.  Thank God.  It's just loud.  Those fucking creatures.  They put creatures in our bodies, Captain. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  That's what I got.  Fucking those goddamn Barathecon things in my ears.  No.  Hurts.  It doesn't actually hurt, but it's annoying.  I hear that.  Sometimes it's really loud.  Like, sometimes I'll wake up and be like, fucking, what is the toilet running?  Did I have water on?  Right.  So we're like, whoosh.  I'll be like, oh no, it's just my ears.  I can't fucking get that sound out of my head.  It's torturous.  I wanted to play the Menino thing, but we played it this time yesterday, so remind me 
[03:10:00]  to play it again tomorrow.  Okay.  I'll just realize that.  And then the Glenn Beck thing, is that good?  It's interesting.  Talk point.  He's defending somebody on MSNBC.  He's really defending Melissa Harris-Perry, the one we beat the shit out of yesterday?  Maybe.  He says take.  He's defending her right to make a distasteful joke.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's right along the same line.  You're going to agree with him.  Well, that's just it.  He's not defending her apologies, defending the fact that she shouldn't have had your  apologies.  Yeah.  The left never defends your right, to tell a tasteless joke.  Right. 
[03:10:30]  The right will come to your defense and be like, all right.  And it's just because the right really doesn't have that platform to crucify people and get  them fucking really thrown off of MSNBC, because they won't do it.  They'll never go after their own media.  It's amazing.  Madam.  She is truly awful.  Yeah.  I'm going home.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:11:00]  Sam will do a little post-show now.  Oh.  And Jimmy, do you have anything you're promoting?  Yeah.  Just announcing what will I'm sure be another sold-out show.  Pittsburgh, February 28th.  I'm going to be at the Carnegie Music Hall.  Not to be confused, obviously, with the one here in New York City.  Oh.  But the one in Pittsburgh, I'll be there February 28th.  Tickets are on sale this Friday.  This weekend, I'll be in Raleigh at Good Nights.  January 23 through 25, I'll be in Atlanta at the Punchline.  DC, February 6th through 8th, the Improv. 
[03:11:30]  And then 14 and 15, the Borgata.  Oh, that's one I'm going to.  You think the Pittsburgh people have that same joke?  You know, how do you.  Practice?  How do you get to.  Yeah.  You think they have that same joke?  Make a left at the coal mine.  That's their joke.  How do you get to Carnegie Hall?  Go on down that way.  It's a little different, you think?  Go on down that way.  Go on over there.  No, but there are probably a lot of Nerdist fans from Pittsburgh. 
[03:12:00]  That's right.  Oh, that's going to be awesome.  Jimmy's on the Nerdist podcast.  So they'll wind up fucking showing up in May to see me.  We're going to turn this thing around.  I'll turn this thing around.  See you guys tomorrow.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments of today's show.  Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
