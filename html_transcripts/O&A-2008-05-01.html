<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a heavy focus on Grand Theft Auto IV, with recurring jokes about killing a police officer character named "Steve." Listeners recounted their own "Steve" killings, and Anthony played a beer commercial jingle, "Pisswasser," he'd created for the game.  The hosts also discussed the game's mechanics and visual details, particularly regarding prostitution.

The conversation then shifted to Rachel Steele, a radio personality whose lingerie photos online had generated significant Google searches. Opie and Anthony discussed the role of sex appeal in boosting radio ratings, contrasting their approach with that of Elvis Duran and Z100.  Other topics included a listener's PlayStation 3 troubles, the hosts' rivalry with the Hillman morning show, a Minnesota Vikings fan's harassment at an Eagles game, a photo of Boston Mayor Tom Menino appearing to make a gang sign, and their planned "baby-throwing contest" as a satirical jab at other morning shows.  Bill Byrne called in from Los Angeles.  Attempts to play previously aired prank calls featuring Bud Plog and a "phone slam" were unsuccessful due to language and FCC regulations respectively.

A later segment started with a discussion of hockey player Avery’s spleen injury, branching into tangents about the spleen's function and John McCain’s wartime diet.  This transitioned into a call about a wild experience at Veterans Stadium. The conversation then turned to politics, focusing on Hillary Clinton, including a conspiracy theory about the Illuminati and Obama, jokes about her pop culture ignorance, and crude jokes about her appearance and family. A bizarre song about Hillary was played. Bill Burr was in studio promoting his shows, and Nick DiPaolo and Bear Grylls were mentioned as previous guests. Club Soda Kenny’s “When Bad Things Happen to Good People” bit, featuring graphic and darkly humorous anecdotes, followed, along with another mention of a phone slam.  Further discussion of Rachel Steele and a best man's speech concluded this section.  A clip of Congressman Alvin Holmes rambling about beer was also played.

Another segment began with discussion of an Alabama state representative before diving into a hilariously awful best man speech filled with off-color jokes and morbid humor about family members. Bear Grylls then joined the show, recounting extreme survival experiences from *Man vs. Wild*, including wrestling alligators, eating eyeballs, and noodling for catfish.  The conversation then shifted to Bill Burr (who was already in the studio), his recent firearm purchase, and the politics surrounding the Obama campaign and Reverend Wright.  This discussion involved considerable offensive language.  Jackie Coogan and his wife were present in the studio during this portion.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on the 2008 presidential election and Barack Obama's relationship with Reverend Jeremiah Wright, sparking debates about racism and double standards in media coverage.  The conversation was often profanity-laced and covered gun control, with Ted Nugent (“Uncle Ted”) calling in to share his views.  A video of babies being dropped in India was shown, prompting shocked reactions and humor. Blind Dave also called in. The hosts promoted upcoming appearances and discussed their personal gun ownership.

The final segment discussed Anthony's attire, then abruptly shifted to the Obama race controversy and a random discussion about Sidney Poitier.  Bill Burr and Nick DiPaolo joined Opie for a lengthy discussion of old-school hockey, interrupted by a young, uninvited guest who disliked hockey, leading to a heated debate with homophobic slurs. The "Line of the Day" segment was interspersed with more hockey talk, guest anecdotes, speculation about Anthony's online activity, and jokes.  The segment ended with final comments and promotions for the guests' performances.  Travis's wife visited the studio with her French Bulldog, leading to a vulgarly humorous segment involving the dog, much to her discomfort.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  We got Big A in studio.  He's got the tongue scraper.  He just scraped out an oyster.  He rocks.  Get in there for a sniff of that sample.  Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up! 
[00:01:00]  Shut the f*** up!  This is where entertainment is going.  When you reenact baby diaper mustache and tippy-tombs underpants.  Oh no, you wouldn't.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  Alright, open them up.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  So, that man says.  Time to make believe we're wide awake.  Yeah!  Because we got to entertain America.  The masses.  Good morning, Rachel Steele.  Grr.  Oh.  Grr.  Rachel.  Oh, I got an email from Rachel Steele.  Thank you, yes.  And those photos she sent were hot.  Those photos in the email she sent?  Of course.  She's not stupid.  I'm kidding.  Oh.  I didn't read the email because I didn't see no attachments. 
[00:02:00]  Rachel Steele is the jock that comes on after us in Cleveland.  By the way, good morning to Cleveland.  And we mentioned, I don't even remember how it came about, but we were talking about Rachel  Steele.  Turns out she's really, really hot and she doesn't mind showing off her hotness.  And she's got pictures on the radio station website where she's in lingerie and teddies  and just showing off how hot she could be.  And we just kind of talked about it. 
[00:02:30]  We didn't tell anyone a Google bomb.  No.  And she became one of the big searches in America yesterday on Google.  Google certainly did.  I'm telling you, man, it's all about hot girls and sex.  We need to bring more of that back to the radio show and screw Elvis Duran and Z100 and  their dumb morning zoo here in New York.  We will be the number one morning show in America.  Wow.  How do we do that?  I don't know.  And if we're not, Elvis will be.  Right.  What planet are we on? 
[00:03:00]  Number one.  I will be number one.  That's what we strive for.  We got a long ways to go.  We understand.  But no one really wants to listen to the morning zoo radio shows.  They do.  Who gives a crap radio?  Yeah.  I love that.  Who gives a crap radio?  But this Rachel Steele.  Wow.  Wow.  We people seem to enjoy her.  Yeah.  They they popped up her pictures, I guess.  And that helped out the Google numbers.  Yeah.  The Google.  A note to my my old friend, Bull, who follows us in in Buffalo on the edge. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you might want to pick up a few teddies and then maybe we'll start talking about you  too.  Wants to see that.  Me and Bull go way, way back.  And he's probably probably like, come on, man.  Will you throw me a bone and talk about me a little bit?  But this Rachel Steele's got our attention right now.  Yes.  I think we put some videos and pictures up on onaradio.com.  So but that's that's that's something we'll talk about maybe a little later this morning. 
[00:04:00]  GTA GTA for.  Yeah.  All the rage.  It they got to change the name of the game to kill Steve for.  Why?  What's going on?  Because that's that's pretty much what everyone here is doing.  Well, of course, we've talked about it.  Everybody that we know is in the game.  Pretty much.  Pretty much everyone we know is in the game in some capacity.  We easily know I was I was started to count last night.  We easily know about 20 people. 
[00:04:30]  I lost count of 20, actually.  Yeah.  Probably even more that are in the game in some fashion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Steve, our own Steve, is one of the police officers that patrol, I guess, the boardwalk  around Coney Island.  Is that where you found him, Dan?  No.  If you also want to play kill Steve, you can do it near the hospital as well.  Oh, near the hospital.  Yes.  Because now everyone's just looking for Steve by going around and pushing policemen. 
[00:05:00]  And you just go around and give him a shove.  And then you'll hear like, hey, what are you doing?  Or knock it off.  Get away.  And then you hear, stop it.  I know how to use this.  And you know it's Steve.  So, Dan, how did you greet Steve when you found him?  Well, I brushed into somebody.  I said, I think I recognize that voice.  And I was in the middle of something.  I was like, you know what?  I got to double back and check.  And sure enough, I kept bumping into him and kept saying, Steve, things. 
[00:05:30]  Like, stop doing that.  And with the police, if you nudge them enough, they get angry and pull out their gun.  Yes, they will start shooting you.  And try to arrest you or shoot you.  And unfortunately, he drew first.  Hey, I'm a damn expert.  Stop, will you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I drew faster.  And yeah, Steve took a big load of shotgun to the face.  He shot him in the face. 
[00:06:00]  Steve.  So satisfying.  Just from these casual conversations about GTA 4, I'm starting to get the feeling that the staff might have a problem with Steve.  They're running him over.  They're shooting him in the face.  It really is fun.  Have we found the gay E-Rock?  No one has found the gay E-Rock.  Not yet.  Reports are coming in.  And I think this is CokeLogic.  CokeLogic writes, Rick Shapiro is on one of the talk channels.  And I, too, killed Steve.  Everybody kills Steve.  Everyone's just killing Steve. 
[00:06:30]  It must be fun to kill Steve.  I couldn't get out of the dock.  Poor Jimmy can't play the game.  I was driving.  I kept backing into the fence and going forward and hitting the fence.  And my finger was...  It looked like that scene in Austin Powers where he's trying to turn around in that little cart in the too narrow hallway.  Sure.  I got to ask Jimmy now.  You're gaming.  You don't do a lot of gaming.  No, I don't.  What was the last game you were really, really into before this GTA 4?  You're kidding, right?  Astro.  That's a big gap, Jimmy.  I know.  I'm a bit behind. 
[00:07:00]  There wasn't another game in there that you kind of took a liking to?  Oh, my God.  It was not.  This one.  Wow.  And I'm trying to run.  And I'm trying to run.  And all I heard is duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.  My little footsteps.  And I'm walking in the dark by the ship.  And I walk onto the boat.  And I'm looking around.  And I keep trying to run.  But I keep, like, ducking.  I'm so annoyed.  I'm trying to run.  And I'm ducking.  You're just ducking.  Hitting the wrong button, obviously.  Did you get to fire any cool weapons?  I couldn't.  No, I couldn't find it. 
[00:07:30]  I hit the button.  I finally, my phone came up.  And I knew what to do.  And I kept trying to, like, drive.  I'm driving.  And every time I try to speed up, I zoom in and look at the car closer.  And then I zoom out.  You're hitting the view thing.  Yes, I was.  I was incorrect.  Thank you.  Do you miss asteroids where it was just a couple buttons?  Oh, so easy.  Shoot, turn, move.  That's all you had to worry about in asteroids.  Don't give up.  Keep going.  And someday you two will kill Steve.  I'm dying.  Now I have to go in to find where the Coney Island thing is. 
[00:08:00]  I'll go there.  And I'll go to the boardwalk.  And I'll try to find her.  Yeah, try to find her there.  Or the hospital.  We should get a montage of just people killing Steve.  Killing Steve.  That would be good.  And we'll put them all together.  Record your Steve killings.  And we'll put it up on YouTube or something for the faithful listeners of the show.  I had a problem with my PlayStation 3 yesterday.  I was a day behind you guys.  I went home.  And I go to load GTA 4 into the front of the PlayStation 3.  It's not taking the disc.  Oh, boy.  And I don't know much about the...  Just spit on it? 
[00:08:30]  Well, I don't know much...  You take it.  I don't know much about...  I don't know much about the PlayStation 3 console.  I just got it.  Yeah.  So I just assumed you're supposed to just shove it in there.  Oh.  So I shove it in there and it disappears.  And the machine never took it.  It disappeared because I shoved it in far enough where...  You shoved it in too hard and it stayed in there.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't happy that I was shoving it into the...  Just take it to GameStop and they stitched it up.  And...  That's another same joke I know. 
[00:09:00]  What then?  It's good to say he pinks off his PS3.  Pretty much.  And then I had to get...  PS stands for it.  Then I had to get butter knives out and tweezers...  What?  ...to try to get my GTA 4 game out.  Like trying to get a bagel out of a toaster.  Exactly.  Because I'm...  You know, I was pretty much thinking that my copy of GTA 4 was done.  But then I'm thinking, I think this game's going to be sold out.  I got to save my only copy.  So then I get Sony on the phone and they're like, wow, we've never heard of this problem before  where it actually doesn't take the disc. 
[00:09:30]  And I'm telling you, it didn't take the disc.  So long story short, they told me to hold the eject down.  The disc finally popped out after about 15 or 20 seconds.  And then I had to return my PlayStation 3 yesterday.  Oh, that's a drag.  And I had no receipt.  I didn't go for the extended warranty and all that other crap that they got.  You want to buy this?  And if anything happens, you can just come in and grab one off the shelf.  Right.  You don't even have to bring in the old one.  And I remember...  No.  I remember the time, I'm like, no, if I have any problem with this machine, I was kind 
[00:10:00]  of joking with the lady, I'm coming right back to you.  Thinking, how could I possibly have a problem with a brand new console?  But I got to thank the gang at Best Buy on 62nd and Broadway.  They were totally cool.  Yeah.  Totally cool.  I walked out of there with a brand new PlayStation 3 within 10 minutes.  Oh, nice.  No problems whatsoever, huh?  How long have you had it?  The PlayStation...  I had it...  I bought it a month ago, but I just had it sitting around until Hot Shots and GTA 4 came  out.  And yesterday, I decided to finally, you know, fire it up and start playing.  And nothing. 
[00:10:30]  You got a fix, right?  I got a brand new one.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Damn.  Here he is, the victim.  Steve, everyone's killing you on GTA 4.  Steve, everyone is just taking such pleasure in killing you.  You know, I'm flattered that I'm so easy to find in this one, because in the other ones,  you had to go about, you know, several, like 40 missions into the game before I even showed  up on the golf course or any other place, because this is like the third GTA game I've been  in, so I'm so happy that I'm right off the bat.  I'm right off the bat. 
[00:11:00]  You're there to just kill.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  I know.  And, you know, if they want to shoot me, that's fine.  I'm just an officer of the law.  Jimmy.  I'm just protecting everybody.  Trying.  Jimmy, you never got out of the dock area, though?  I was back.  You couldn't figure out how to...  No.  All I heard was Russians talking, and I'm driving, and I literally hit the fence, and then  we'd go forward, and I was trying to turn so I could go between the fence  and the other place, and then I finally did, and I went right into traffic, and I just  hit things.  If I could drive really well, if I'm doing like three miles an hour, like if I'm just 
[00:11:30]  hitting it, it's like...  Then I got out and tried to hijack a truck, but then the black guy jumped out of the truck  and started beating the crap out of me, and I kept hitting the wrong button.  Oh, that's great.  He's punching me, and I'm actually behaving like a typical white person.  I'm just trying to walk away.  Just cowering and trying to walk away.  We've got to set up the game and just make videos of Jimmy playing, because it's hilarious,  because he doesn't really understand this type of gaming yet.  No, not yet.  It's very cute.  Yeah.  It's a lot harder to jack cars. 
[00:12:00]  Not a lot, but it's definitely different than the older games, where you really got little  to no resistance from the people in the cars, and now, if you don't do it right, they just  start punching you and beating the crap out of you.  But shouldn't I have a gun?  I don't know how to get my gun.  Well, you've got to go to the back alleys right now, is where you kind of go and pick up  from some shady characters.  Oh, you're going to buy guns?  Well, you can buy them, or if you go on a certain mission, you'll be given a gun.  You might want to go to Ammo...  Ammonation. 
[00:12:30]  I don't think it's open.  Is it open at the beginning of the game?  No.  Not at the beginning.  Hey, Anthony.  Cheat code Steve.  Have that yet?  Of course Steve has cheat codes already.  I want a cheat code that makes Steve naked, so you can just kill him nude.  Yeah.  I want to relate to my PlayStation 3 brothers.  They changed all the buttons on us for this freaking version of GTA.  What's up with that?  Yeah, they did a little bit.  X used to be the accelerator.  What's going on with this L2, R2 crap?  Yeah, they changed it to the trigger buttons, kind of give you accelerate. 
[00:13:00]  It is easy once you get used to it, because then you can go forward and reverse a lot easier  to make those cool moves where you whip the car around, change directions like they do  in the movies.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's kind of a cool move to do.  Once you get out of the parking lot.  I was doing so badly.  I just started knocking the bottom of the fence out.  And then I got out and I'm walking on the ship and I'm so isolated in the game.  No one's even coming out.  No one's around.  He's in like the part where nobody is. 
[00:13:30]  I'm just the guy walking on the phone.  The forbidden zone.  Jimmy found the forbidden zone in GTA 4.  You found the least fun part of the game and stayed there forever.  That's Jimmy.  That's Jimmy, everybody.  Couldn't drive out of the area.  I'm surprised that Tranny didn't pop out.  Hi, Daddy.  Hello, Daddy.  You need assistance from this officer.  Yeah, Laszlo knew you would be in the forbidden zone.  He's like, hey, Laszlo, send me.  No one's looking.  Yeah, I got to read up more about the...  Oh, that is so funny.  I didn't know how the controls worked. 
[00:14:00]  Let's go to Boston.  Carl listening on BCN.  Carl.  Carl.  What's going on?  How are you, sir?  I happened to come across the Hillman morning show yesterday.  I can't talk quite as slow as he does.  He was going over the GTA 4 list of people that were in it.  And he happened to mention that he knows nobody that's in the game at all.  He couldn't recognize not one name on the list.  What a loser.  Oh, jeez.  What a loser.  That's good.  That's why he's been stuck doing morning radio in Worcester, Massachusetts for like 12, 15 years. 
[00:14:30]  He's a liar.  Can we please attack him, please?  No, it's just a steady stream, whatever you want to do.  Yeah, there's nothing to do.  He's in our rearview mirror.  I mean, a lot of people ask, you know, do you have a problem with the Hillman?  Absolutely, we do.  Back in the day when Anthony and I did the mayor's prank thing, you know, it was not the smartest thing to do.  So he like ran and hid like a little cockroach.  The only person back in the day that support us and said this is BS that they're going to fire Opie and Anthony was Ozone. 
[00:15:00]  A stand-up guy who almost got fired himself and he had nothing to do with the prank just because he said,  screw management, I'm going on the air and speaking my mind.  This is crazy that they're going to let these guys go for this dumb prank.  And Hillman hid and then took the corporate line, the company line.  And now he's saying that he doesn't know anybody in Grand Theft Auto, please.  Meaning he does.  You know, half the people, half, there's like 20 people from our show alone.  Yeah, comics and staff.  A lot of Boston people are in the game. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  All right, thanks, girl.  Oh, man town.  Yeah.  Great.  Tim and Rochester.  I don't know why I find it so funny that Steve is just the primary target.  All right, let's go to Tim in Rochester, sure.  The home of Brother Weez.  What's up, Tim?  The game is fantastic.  I spent six hours picking up hookers, killing them, and then killing Steve.  Yeah, that's always the classic move that people do in GTA. 
[00:16:00]  They've been doing it for all the versions.  You get a hooker, you have sex with her,  and as she's walking away, you kill her and take her money.  You can pick the service you get, too.  You can pick from three different choices,  a $20 job, a $50 job, or...  What, they changed the whole hooker thing in GTA?  And you could see pretty graphically what's going on.  Oh, so weak.  Like, especially in a convertible, that shot we were looking at,  the girl is straddling a gentleman in the driver's seat, 
[00:16:30]  and the top's down on the car, so you just see everything.  Yeah.  And they're going to town.  Oh, sweet.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Thank you, Tim.  One of them belittled my manhood.  Let me hear that.  I stabbed her to death.  Yeah.  Very nice, Tim.  Thank you.  It's just the needless violence.  I know this is going to be way too inside,  but I think the faithful listeners would kind of enjoy it.  You've got to start taping your killing of Steve.  Yeah.  And we'll promote the best ones, and we'll pop them up on YouTube. 
[00:17:00]  Just bump into them, have them say something, and blast them in the face, or stab them.  We'll have a whole series on YouTube, and the GTA fans that have no idea about this radio show will be like,  who the hell is this Steve guy?  Steve.  Why are people obsessed with killing Steve in GTA 4?  Yes, there.  Well, just talking about stabbing hookers,  I was playing online with a couple people the other day,  and just, it does bring out some of the dark natures in people. 
[00:17:30]  I heard somebody be like, yeah, bleed for me, bitch.  I was like, Jesus Christ.  You can't.  It's just a video game.  Oh, God.  He's like, yeah, old lady, I want to see your blood.  I was like, jeez.  Was this in the game or online?  This is online.  Oh, online.  And that, you know, that is odd,  because I take great pleasure in killing old people in the game.  Like, old ladies walking down the street,  I can't resist just pummeling them. 
[00:18:00]  And not easy, like shooting them.  I have to beat them with something.  Like a bat.  You can pick things up and hit old people.  Oh, yes, Jimmy, get out of the parking lot.  What are you doing?  Leave the ship.  There's nothing on the ship.  I forgot my ticket.  Jimmy's just stuck on a ship somewhere.  There's a whole world out there.  There's old people to beat.  A whole new world.  You just beat old people with baseball bats.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, and we're getting a little attention. 
[00:18:30]  There was a Google alert that came out yesterday about the Pisswasser.  Yes.  Which is a beer commercial in GTA 4 that Anthony sang the jingle for.  Yes, I'm very proud.  And actually, it's animated, too.  Yeah, it's a great little visual commercial that's on one of the TV channels.  And it's getting a lot of props, a lot of props in the gaming community.  So want to play the commercial here?  Who am I to not plug myself?  In the game, it's not censored.  Yeah, no beeps. 
[00:19:00]  You know, but we have to keep it friendly.  Why?  I don't know, because 12-year-olds are playing GTA 4.  You figure it out, because we can't anymore.  Last night, I think I ****ed the bed.  Got so drunk, I gave it to you.  Life is just a merciful blur.  When you pop a Pisswasser.  Pisswasser, don't bring it slow.  3 a.m. by some flow.  Sleep in the bathroom on the floor. 
[00:19:30]  What really matters anymore?  All the crap you do all day, who **** cares?  Anyway, Pisswasser, this is beer.  Drive drunk off a beer.  Pisswasser, drink all day.  It helps the trouble slow away.  Pisswasser, cheap German lager for export only.  Good morning. 
[00:20:00]  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  James S. from Riverhead writes,  First of all, I was bartending all day yesterday,  and every time I grabbed one of those, one of these...  How did he write this?  It was funny when I read it.  Okay.  First of all, I was bartending all day yesterday,  and every time I grabbed one of these... 
[00:20:30]  I couldn't stop laughing.  And then he writes,  Moo, moo.  I sat playing GTA 4 last night and watched TV in a video game for two effing hours.  That's what Anthony was saying.  Yeah, you could just sit down and watch TV in the game on your TV.  Somebody said, speaking of which,  Oh, Hump X.  He writes,  The animation Republican Space Rangers in the game is effing hilarious.  Oh, yeah, that one is really funny.  Just amazing how much in-game content there is.  They went crazy with it. 
[00:21:00]  I still haven't gotten to a computer to check out their websites,  but there's like hundreds of pages of website pages in-game  that have all been thought out,  and they're very funny.  Just a lot of content.  Really good.  Very cool.  The Mooer thing.  Mooer.  Didn't really work as I read his instant feedback,  but that was something I was laughing about all day yesterday as well. 
[00:21:30]  We should play it again.  It's 20 seconds.  Yeah.  I guess this guy, what, a little congressman, I believe, from Alabama.  His name's Alvin Holmes.  I think he wants to ban, like, import beer because it has a higher alcohol content.  I think that's what he's trying to do.  Yeah, there was some kind of beer with a higher alcohol than American beer,  and, yeah, he didn't want that to be sold in Alabama.  Right, and he was trying to talk about beer,  and he wanted to list a bunch of beers,  and Jimmy pointed out yesterday he just couldn't do it after the first one. 
[00:22:00]  He got to one.  He got to one beer.  And had to ask for help,  and then one of his cronies there helped him out by saying,  Moo, Moo, Moo, Coors.  And then tried to say Coors, too,  but we didn't even hear Coors for the first 20 times we listened to him.  Yeah, exactly, because we were laughing over that part,  but here it is from yesterday.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it? 
[00:22:30]  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser, what is it?  Mill.  Miller.  Coors.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  Moo.  Coors.  What is wrong with that guy?  Who is that other man?  That's mumbling ass.  I don't know.  We need to know more info about that guy. 
[00:23:00]  Moo.  Moo.  Budweiser.  What's another one?  What's another one?  After Budweiser.  I'm stumped.  Budweiser.  They have to be happy today.  Yeah.  Looks like our advertising's working.  That's the one that he remembered.  That's the only beer he can remember.  Moo.  Hey, we should get Travis in here really fast.  He went down to Philly to watch his Canadians get slapped about the face.  Flyers, baby.  Here he comes.  No flyers.  Here he comes. 
[00:23:30]  Tough for me to say that being an Islander fan, but I certainly don't want the Rangers.  Travis.  Yeah.  So just to fill everyone in, Travis's wife is a huge Montreal Canadian fan, and because  she, even though she's very beautiful, but she also wears the pants in your family.  Well, someone has to.  You decide you needed to be a Montreal Canadian fan as well.  Yeah.  That was my own decision.  Where did you grow up?  No, it wasn't.  I grew up in New Jersey.  So you should be a Devils fan, maybe a Rangers fan.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Depending on what part of Jersey, maybe a Flyers fan.  Not a Montreal Canadiens fan.  You're doing it for your wife.  Last on the list.  Right.  Of course, whatever poopsie says.  That's not true at all.  Yeah, okay.  She got me into hockey.  Yeah, you wanted that dog.  Sure you did.  Oh, I love Dexter.  Come on.  Shut up with Dexter.  Dexter, the Canadians.  I'm going to make another video today.  What do you like?  It better be a snuff film of Dexter.  We don't know what Travis likes.  We know what his wife likes.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  We know his wife likes cute little dogs with big cute ears.  Little French bulldogs.  We know she likes the Montreal Canadiens, and that she's a hardcore hockey fan.  She likes starting fights at furniture stores.  Yeah.  But Travis, we don't know anything about him.  But Travis can't finish.  Thank you, Anthony.  We learned last week that they decided to make the trip down to Philly for the Flyers-Canadians  game last night.  Yeah.  And the Canadiens lost to the Flyers.  I forgot what the score was.  4-2 or something like that? 
[00:25:00]  3-2.  Oh, okay.  And your wife, not you, insisted that she wears her Habs jersey.  Yeah.  Well, she...  And the listeners came out of the woodwork saying this is not a good idea, especially  in Philly.  These guys are insane down there.  We've seen people heckle little kids until they've taken off the opposing team's jersey.  Yeah, she ended up not wearing her jersey.  She wore her shirt, which was still red, so obviously in 19,000 orange shirts, it's obvious 
[00:25:30]  what team she's rooting for.  And we saw some other Habs fans sprinkled throughout the crowd.  But...  Yeah, literally, with beer.  You just get stuff thrown at them.  There were some that were far more vocal than I ever...  Really?  Yeah.  Like, what happened?  No, you could just...  We warned you.  You're, like, surprised.  We warned you.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Philly doesn't play.  No, no, no.  I mean, there were Habs fans that were far more vocal than... 
[00:26:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's why.  Oh, okay.  Like, you know...  Jeez, dummies.  ...that they drove down from Montreal that day, and they just didn't care, and I'm like,  you're insane.  Loser Joe from Delaware.  Go Flyers.  Hope, I remember a couple months ago, you said F the Flyers.  Yeah, well, certainly F the Flyers, but in this case, you know, I don't want the Canadians  winning.  But we're friends.  Why wouldn't you want that?  Because I know you don't like hockey.  You're doing it for yourself.  Yes, I do.  Which is very nice, but, I mean, stop making believe that you actually are into hockey. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, at least just fess up.  So, anyway, any problems down there?  Not as many as I thought there were going to be.  We were sitting behind...  Not as many as we all hoped there would be.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sitting there thinking, wow, this is a real letdown for the radio show.  I'm not getting punched in the face.  We were sitting in front of four, or behind four of the largest, most annoying Flyers  fans in the world.  Oh, really?  And they weren't even drinking.  They were just insane.  The crowd is insane. 
[00:27:00]  I'll say that much.  They love their hockey.  They love their sports down there.  Yeah, they really do.  But, yeah, she would get razzed, you know, like here and there when we would go outside  to smoke or waiting for beer.  Um, but the more beers she had, I think the, uh, the less she wanted to take it.  Oh, oh, boy.  Because at first, at first it was, it was fine.  It was just, you know, you kind of have to laugh off the comments because they're so stupid.  Sure. 
[00:27:30]  And then once she had, like, her fourth beer and the game was winding down.  You realize it was Fredo and his wife.  The godfather, too.  Could you take care of this, Michael?  Once the game was winding down and people continued to chant, you know, F Canada and Canada sucks  as the country, not the team.  Right.  The entire country must suffer.  Yeah.  She started, uh, she started talking back here and there.  Like a little smack.  Yeah, and, and, and at first it was okay because, because she was kind of being, like, playful 
[00:28:00]  with the people that were doing it, you know, like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then, you know, towards the end, she would insert, you know, names afterwards.  Of course.  Uh, which I can't believe.  And were you just like, oh, honey, please.  Oh, ho, calm down.  Ten minutes beforehand, she was like, it's all in the way you say it.  And I'm like, remember how you were saying it?  It's all in the way you say it.  Oh, no.  The explain it.  Explain ten minutes ago to her.  Yeah.  Oh, geez.  But she was getting upset because, because people were insulting, uh, her country. 
[00:28:30]  And she was explaining to them how half of your team is Canadian.  You know?  So, why are you saying F Canada when the guy who scored the winning goal for you is Canadian?  You bring up a good point.  A few years back, the Islanders were playing, uh, the Maple Leafs in the playoffs.  And the, uh, the Canadian National Anthem, you know, was being sung.  And the entire place starts booing.  And I'm like, do you guys understand you're, like, insulting the Islanders, too, here? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  They're all Canadian.  Like, like, easily three-quarters of the team are from Canada.  Why are you booing their National Anthem?  They basically have nothing to do with America except play in the NHL and then go back to Canada in the offseason.  They did that last night, too.  They start booing, uh, the Canadian Anthem, and, uh, it didn't hold out through the entire  Anthem, but, you know, she started singing it as loud as she could.  Oh, that's a good one.  Um, yeah.  Which is, which is fine. 
[00:29:30]  I have been a good one.  Oh, it's fine.  Bill from Waterford, uh, he says that, uh, this relationship is perfect because Lisa likes  hockey and Travis loves figure skating, so, you know, they both get, uh, a little happiness  that I get to watch at these games.  Yeah, so Lisa, what's going on?  Good morning.  Oh, wow.  She's sleepy.  What time do you guys get back from Philly?  Midnight.  Midnight, and you had to be here at 4, 4.30, whatever?  Wow.  The hubby's up.  Up as a pup.  You'll have to excuse me, Nathaniel just woke me up, so I sound like, like, junk. 
[00:30:00]  No worries.  So, uh, how was your experience down there in Philly?  I hate Philly.  She hates Philly.  Yeah, she couldn't wait to get out of there.  I said to Travis, if he ever gets a job there, there's no way I'm moving.  Really?  You would never move to Philly?  I will never move there.  I never want to go back there.  I hate everybody.  Wow.  They don't play.  We try to tell you.  You know what?  It would be, it would have been okay. 
[00:30:30]  Like, I can deal with smart comments, but there's so, I mean, just the stuff that was  being, that was so ignorant.  There's no other word for it, but ignorant.  Just like Travis told, I overheard Travis telling you about, you know, booing Canada and  stuff like that.  But, I mean, some of the other comments were just so silly.  You just kind of laugh and feel bad for them almost.  Do you remember some of the comments that were silly?  Um, like I said, I just woke up, so I'm a little foggy. 
[00:31:00]  Um, I'll, I'll think about that.  With a yelling thing like, we're going to march to victory.  Yeah.  A lot, a lot of people asking, what's a hab?  Yeah.  Were they making up their own versions of what hab would be?  Yeah.  Lots of French talk where, you know, half their team probably doesn't even speak English.  Sure.  You know?  You're a hab-sexual.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Hab.  Hab.  Yeah.  We just found it funny that there's people in Briere jerseys that are, get this French 
[00:31:30]  Canadian crap out of here, where he is, he's French Canadian.  Yeah.  Stop.  I think it's more the loyalty to their city, their fine city.  Boy, yeah, she, we got in the car and she's, I never want to come back here again.  Well, I said to Travis that, like, two minutes before the buzzer, I said, you better get  me out of here because there's going to be trouble.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're walking out.  She, uh, she went to the bathroom with two minutes left, um, because we pretty much didn't 
[00:32:00]  think that they were going to win, which they didn't.  Uh, so, so there's two minutes left.  Oh, hell of a fan you guys are.  Oh, leaving early.  Hey, that was, that was, that was her decision.  And you, of course, got up and, and left.  And, hey, I gotta be at work at, I gotta be up at three in the morning.  I'm fine with beating traffic.  What was the score?  4-2.  3-2.  You left.  I thought it was 4-2.  Was it?  I, did they, I don't think so.  Wait, what game were you left?  3-2.  Well, what was the score last night?  Ah, whatever.  Travis.  3-2.  3-2?  They might have scored again after we left. 
[00:32:30]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  All right.  Um.  Don't argue.  That's, yeah, we don't want to do that.  I'm getting in a fight with her.  You are so whipped, dude.  I mean, it's cool and all, but you are.  You're right.  All right.  Um.  But, yeah, we're, we're leaving, and, uh, and some Flyers fans just start yelling at  her to go home, and that's when, that's when she sticks both of her middle fingers  out.  And then the, go home, B. Not go home.  Go home is one thing.  Go home, B.  I just thought. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  Oh, a bitch?  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Go home, bitch.  And, uh.  What do you want them to say?  Have a time to grab my arm.  Have a good night.  Have a pleasant evening.  Thanks for coming.  Home safe.  Yeah, and that's when I grabbed her arm and said, all right, let's get out of here before  you start.  Go home, bitch.  Jesus, they are awful.  Oh, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, wow.  So she popped up her middle finger?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  And I'm sure they had some comments for those.  I, what, I was walking too fast the year.  Yeah, you're running.  Let's go, let's go, let's go.  You need to take one of those karate classes. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, you know, I'm gonna.  You're gonna need some of that.  Yeah, you know, if we're gonna keep going to these hockey games, I might have to, I might  have to do something.  No, if you're gonna continue being married, you need a karate lesson.  We're gonna keep going out.  Okay, Travis, I'll protect you.  Thanks, babe.  No, it's not cool, and it's sad.  Okay, because I said it was cool that you were whipped, and I actually didn't mean that.  Yeah.  It's not cool.  Oh, really?  It is sad.  Oh, all right.  I'm gonna do something about that, then.  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Where's game five?  Game five is in Montreal.  Montreal.  Yeah, you guys are in deep trouble there, so.  All right, Lisa, thank you.  No problem, guys.  Take care.  All right, Travis.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Oh, you're welcome.  I'm sorry I didn't have a better ending.  No, it's pretty good, actually.  Thanks, man.  Take the headphones off and leave.  Oh, yeah.  Scott, Jersey.  He started, he really started to feel comfortable.  I know.  It's like, all right, thanks, Travis.  Yeah, well, let me tell you another thing here.  Yeah, anything else we're gonna talk about?  You guys want to break first? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Scott, what do you got?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Thank you.  Just wanted to add a comment.  Not a flyer, but I've been in Eagle Stadium a couple times.  I'm a Minnesota Vikings fan.  I wore my Randy Moss and Dante Culpepper jersey one time.  Absolutely the worst move you could ever make.  I've had cheese steak thrown at me.  Double D batteries from the top of the stadium.  Cheese steak.  I had my jersey burned up and cigarettes out on the back of my jersey.  I didn't realize it until I got home. 
[00:35:00]  I basically just want to say F the Eagles fans and F the group of guys that burn my Dante Culpepper jersey up.  Very nice.  I gotta tell you.  Philly or animals, man.  I'm gonna say it again.  Oh, yeah.  Philly doesn't play.  I'm all fans.  You go to Madison Square Garden for a Knicks game or a Rangers game.  There's a bunch of Wall Street douches in their suits.  They're on the phone half the time.  They don't even pay attention to the game.  It's like a social event.  It's like they're going to happy hour or something.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Boston's the same way. 
[00:35:30]  Philly certainly is the same way.  Even out on Long Island.  Long Island doesn't even compare to what goes on in some of these other cities.  Buffalo, ridiculous.  These guys are hardcore.  They don't go to the games in their suits.  They don't spend half the game on cell phones.  They all wear their jerseys and really, really get into it.  Really get into it.  Because there's nothing else to do.  If you want to enjoy the game, definitely don't wear a phone.  There's nothing else.  That's why they're all good fighters in Philly, too.  I love Philly.  And I'll tell you this with love.  You're dumbbells.  That's why you put out the best fighters in the world. 
[00:36:00]  Joe Frazier, Sonny Liston, I mean, Meldrick Taylor.  Yeah.  A lot of fighters come out of Philly because they're just animals.  There's nothing to do but fight.  The cheesesteak is the big get in Philly.  Yeah.  It's meat with a bunch of cheese dumped on it.  That's healthy.  It's going on.  It's going on.  Norton, we're going to go club someone who's not white.  All right.  Have a great day.  Yeah.  A quick little jab, too.  It's a sin we're not on in Philly because I've been keeping track. 
[00:36:30]  The ratings are down over 40% since we've been dropped by WISP.  So just want to bring that to everyone's attention today.  And they're starting to talk about it.  And corporate eyes are starting to go like this.  What's going on down there?  Yikes.  I thought you guys had a plan.  Not looking so good so far, huh, boys?  But you know best.  Hey, and now we move up to Boston.  Mm-hmm.  Because our favorite mayor. 
[00:37:00]  What a lummox.  This guy is amazing.  Mayor Menino.  Look, we openly acknowledge how stupid our prank was back in the day.  It's been 10 years that we told Boston that the mayor died in a car accident for April Fool's.  What happened?  Oh, it turns out he wasn't.  Oh, it is.  Killed, yeah, yeah.  But we can't get enough of this guy.  And we used to make fun of this guy way before we did our mayor's prank. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  We were on Mayor Menino very early on.  The first time I ever saw him, I was like, oh, this guy's gold.  This is gold for radio.  Well, the latest thing, Mayor Menino let his fingers do the mumbling.  What's this?  Mayor Tom Menino making a gang sign?  Yep.  You see the picture, Jimmy?  No.  It's hysterical.  Look at this.  Look at this idiot.  He's with some of what you want to call them, the brothers.  Some homies, yeah.  He's with some homies, some street people.  And they're all just making all sorts of gang signs. 
[00:38:00]  And then Mayor Menino just imitates them and puts up, he's basically making two okay signs.  Okays.  But that's not okay.  No.  That means something very different if you're from the street.  Yeah.  Someone alert David Stern.  We need fines, sanctions, sensitivity training.  The mayor was snapped doing the three-finger salute at the 2005 Boston Hip-Hop Festival  with the guys from Special Teams with a Z. 
[00:38:30]  But we don't think the mayor has gone off and joined the Crips or the P-Row blood either.  I don't know what that...  All right.  I think he thought he was speaking in Italian, said Menino spokesgal, dot, Joyce.  Either that or he was making shadow puppets.  Shadow puppets.  Yeah, no, I knew what he was doing.  He didn't know.  He's making gang signs.  Yeah, Menino, who has been known to mangle the English language, didn't do any better  with his sign language because the mayor seems to be doing the hand thing backwards. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, he's doing like an O-Tay.  Right.  According to photographer A. Garcia, who snapped a pic of Menino in his hip-hop Passe, the guys  are not giving a shout-out to the aforementioned Bloods.  They were throwing the Boston sign, a three-up or B thing meant to signify the hub or sometimes  the three stripes on Adidas shoes.  Confused yet?  Well, I mean, it's safe to say Menino had no clue what he was doing.  How about they just wave like every other citizen?  Black people, how about you just wave or give a wink to the camera? 
[00:39:30]  There's nothing better than when they do a news live shot from an urban community and  you just see people walking behind the camera and they're either very arthritic or they're  throwing up gang signs.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, what is that?  Can you just, like Jimmy said, just wave?  White people have gang signs, too.  We give the thumbs up because life is good.  Sunshine.  Do the little, like, you know, close one eye. 
[00:40:00]  Do a little wink.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's a hilarious story, though, man.  That Mayor Menino is just gold.  He's clueless, completely clueless.  He's just gold, man.  And now we move to New York.  We're obsessed with this morning zoo format.  Well, it does seem to do well.  This who gives a crap radio that these morning zoos do across America.  And, yeah, we'll admit it, we're a little jealous.  They're getting all the attention here in New York.  They got the number one show in New York City, and they shouldn't have the number one show 
[00:40:30]  in New York City because they don't do anything.  They're not funny people.  They're not edgy people.  They don't make you think.  If it was a good show, I'd be like, damn, God, that's a good show, and they got great  ratings, and it makes sense.  You think we have a lot of people on our show?  They probably have 12 people that are on every day because that's what you do with morning  zoos.  You just throw enough, just throw a ton of people on the air.  We're giving too many people credit, I think, like New Yorkers. 
[00:41:00]  Just giving them too much credit.  Why?  Because we assume that they would listen to this and just go like, ugh, but they listen  and go, oh, it's so funny.  They go to the office and just chat about it, a little chat about what they heard on their  drive-in.  Dude, their latest bit is Battle of the Babies.  Ugh!  That's good.  Why?  Unless it entails picking them up by the heels and swinging them at each other.  I should have a baby-throwing contest. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, hey, that's a good idea.  Can we do that?  No, you can't swing them.  It's a shot-put style.  You put their little hiney in your hand, and then you shot-put them across the room.  I bet I could shot-put a baby probably 20 feet.  And unlike these sickos, I love kids, but I would be part of the baby-throwing contest  because they would make it safe with foam and stuff, you know?  Yeah, well, you've got to put foam down.  Let them land softly.  You want them to, like, giggle when they hit the floor.  Dude, we should promote this. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, baby-throwing.  Media attention.  Baby-throwing contest.  Baby-throwing contest.  Coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Steve, just make a promo.  Promo.  That'll be good enough to get a lot of people scared out there.  We're looking for people with—how old?  Let's run it—  From newborn to what?  Let's run it as a real promo.  And let's not even talk about it anymore.  No.  And let's just, like, run it around the clock and see what comes out of the woodwork.  Okay, we're looking for parents that have babies of what age? 
[00:42:30]  From newborn to six months?  Let's call it just-baked to six months.  Okay.  To six months old for O.P. and Anthony's baby-throwing contest.  I want Steve—  Let's see who can throw—  And I want Steve to make this as a legitimate promo that you hear on every other dopey radio station.  Throw your baby.  And we're just going to go into break, like, playing this over and over and over again.  And we're not going to mention it again from this moment on.  How about you have to throw the baby and see how many milk bottles you can knock over? 
[00:43:00]  Like, it's a ball.  Like, we're going to set up your milk bottle on the table and you're going to hold the baby.  Knock them down?  Yeah.  I like going for distance.  Yeah, I like—  I like going for distance.  I like keeping it simple.  The baby-throwing contest for O.P. and Anthony.  We're looking for parents, babies between newborn and six months old to participate in the O.P. and Anthony first annual baby-throwing contest.  Yes.  Okay, that's great. 
[00:43:30]  Make a promo.  So, John from New York is saying, and I swear I have—that's why I'm going to read this.  Ron already did this baby-throwing bit, you effing idiot.  No!  What?  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, John?  I wouldn't put it past the son of a bitch.  Yeah, but did he make a promo?  Well, he did?  Oh, good.  Steve, make the promo.  Yeah.  Did he just talk about it or, you know—  He did baby fighting?  That's baby fighting.  I've seen that.  Oh, of course I've heard the baby fighting bit. 
[00:44:00]  You tool!  Yeah.  It's genius, but, you know—  And, John, relax.  It's not baby-throwing.  John, relax.  At this point, we don't even know whose show is whose anymore.  Exactly.  It's become one big show.  Half our guys are on the Ron and Fez show.  We've stolen half their guys.  I don't even know who's part of what show.  So, relax on that.  Relax.  Stop blowing up our spot.  Steve, start making a promo.  Make it as serious as possible.  But, yeah, a little jealous of this morning zoo crap because it's taken over radio,  and it has no business being on the radio. 
[00:44:30]  Also, this Elvis Duran, they don't even have enough material to fill up their morning zoo.  They don't have a morning zoo, so they have to play a lot of music.  Yeah.  A lot of music to fill up—  Sorry, I was just looking at an actual baby throwing in India.  Oh, really?  But it wasn't baby throwing.  They throw a baby off a roof, and I guess people catch it or something.  Yeah, but that's—  It's not baby—just stop trying to ruin our fun, you F—just leave us alone.  That's some religious ceremony they're doing, I guess. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  If you don't catch the baby, then, I don't know, you go to hell or something.  You come up with something, and they try to crap on it.  Yeah.  So anyway, we're paying attention to these morning zoos, and we're embracing some of  the stuff they do and bringing it to our show for a little while.  So it's Club Soda Kenny's job to come up with morning zoo-type bits every day, and I think  today, in a little while, he's doing When Bad Things Happen to Good People.  I can't wait.  Yesterday's morning zoo bit that Kenny did was a phone slam because, you know, these shows, 
[00:45:30]  they love to do the prank phone calls.  Oh, the prank calls are a staple of the morning zoo.  And we're here to tell you, we used to be great at doing prank calls.  Yep.  And one day, the lawyers about five years ago said, guys, officially, you're not allowed  to do prank calls on the radio anymore.  It's completely against the FCC regulations.  It's against federal law, to tell you the truth.  It's against the law.  You can be arrested for it.  And these lawyers, because they don't know radio whatsoever, they're like, good news,  though.  You can still do them, but you got to tell the person ahead of time that you're doing it. 
[00:46:00]  I'm like, how would that ever work?  Yeah.  You can't even do the call and then afterwards tell the person, hey, this was a gag.  We want to use it for the air.  You're not allowed to because it's actually wiretapping.  You're recording somebody without their permission.  So basically, you're not allowed to do it.  If we were to do a prank call, we would have to get someone on the phone and go, hi, this  is Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And we're going to do a prank call.  Is that okay?  Do we have your permission?  And then if they say yes, then we can do it. 
[00:46:30]  And then you go, okay, make believe I didn't just say what I said, and here we go.  Right.  Hi, is this Rachel Steele?  Huh?  What?  Yes.  Well, you're fired because you gained a pound.  Whatever.  Just off the cuff.  It doesn't work anymore.  There was a brief window of time where I think jocks tried to go, they'd call somebody and  go, you're on the ONA show, like real quick.  Yeah, real quick.  They would try to throw something in. 
[00:47:00]  So just a little thing for the pass, not a full out attack, but if you're listening  to another radio show and all of a sudden you hear some kind of like phone slam or a  prank phone call on the air, just call them up and go, fake, and then hang up because  you're just not allowed to do them anymore.  But with that said, Club Soda Kenny did a phone slam for everybody yesterday.  Yeah.  And in case you missed it.  God, this is a long effing setup for a 20 second bit that we did yesterday as a throwaway.  But we go to break with this today.  Club Soda Kenny.  Open Anthony's Phone Slam with Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:47:30]  Hi, is this Ray?  Yeah.  Ray, your family's dead.  What?  Remember that faulty propane tank in your backyard?  No.  Well, it blew the house up.  What?  They're all dead.  Oh my God.  You've just been phone slammed.  Who is this?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Oh, nice. 
[00:48:00]  A little Jimmy for your commute.  But that's all you get because now we've got to talk.  It's the Open Anthony Show.  Bill Byrne's studio.  How cool is this?  We haven't seen Bill in a while.  What's going on, everybody?  Now that he moved out to the left coast.  Yeah, man.  With the liberals.  Man.  He's an L.A. guy.  Yeah.  He used to be a New York guy.  Now he's an L.A. guy.  Now I'm totally phony.  Yeah, all fake.  Because everybody here in New York is real, man. 
[00:48:30]  All the tools are out there.  Everyone here is decent and real.  All the plastic people are out there, man.  It's totally fake.  But people here, they just don't lie to you.  Right.  New York is just great, man.  They're just so real, man.  I can't get over it.  Like a cab driver this morning was just, the guy was so real.  It was, I almost thought he was fake.  Because he was so real.  I squeezed his shoulder as I paid him.  Yeah.  Just to make sure. 
[00:49:00]  Jimmy.  Because at least all these fake people.  Speaking of cabs, Jimmy and I shared one yesterday after the show.  Remember I pointed out the guy's name and I said, remember his name and now I don't remember.  It was something Mohammed is what I remember.  It was Hussein Mohammed, right?  I didn't know his first name.  Hussein Mohammed.  That's nice.  Drove me home yesterday.  Did he?  White.  Really?  That's odd.  Middle name Osama?  Yeah.  Let's go to Choppy.  I think Choppy from Boston changed the reason why he wanted to call.  Weren't you going to talk sports, Choppy?  Hey, Bud Plog. 
[00:49:30]  The greatest prank of all time.  The best phone call ever.  I have to agree.  Thank you, sir.  Yes.  Are we allowed to play that still or is it an edited mess now that the rules have changed  in radio?  I think that's one that we're not allowed to play.  Oh my God.  Why?  Because of the language?  Yeah.  That thing has been played on the radio a hundred times easily.  There's no context to it.  It's just saying the word.  If I remember right, it was the repetition of it.  Can we at least...  The repetition, but the repetition, it doesn't have any context.  I'll find out.  It's just saying it.  Get that done. 
[00:50:00]  We've got to play Bud Slug today.  It's so odd.  If not, let's at least...  Can we at least put the audio up on onaradio.com later today?  All right.  If we can't play it on the radio, we'll put it up there for everybody.  Choppy, weren't you talking about sports, too, or no?  Sure.  Oh, no.  Sure.  No, I roll with it.  Screw it.  I had someone on hold, and they wanted to explain how awful the Philly fans are.  Goddamn Choppy.  All right.  I'm a Bruins fan.  We're worse.  Yeah, I'm a Bruins fan.  They call me Choppy.  All right, Choppy. 
[00:50:30]  I love you Boston guys.  I guarantee you.  That guy...  Just a love-hate relationship with us.  That guy lives...  Me and Boston.  And Southie.  That's a Southie.  Yeah.  That's a Southie guy.  Oh, all right.  Well, because Bill Byrne, you know, he loves his sports, and I thought we had a nice setup  for a phone call there, and how...  You don't like talking sports with me?  Well, all right.  What do you think of what happened to Avery?  Wow.  I know.  Right?  That was like... 
[00:51:00]  Oof.  I heard it and was like, whoa.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So what do you think is going to happen?  I probably...  Things like that take time.  Take time to...  Yeah.  Resolve.  Work themselves out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To work themselves out, you know.  But I'm sure in the end, things will be okay.  Why don't you explain it to the new listener to bring everybody up to Avery?  Yeah, exactly.  The Avery thing.  It's a big deal if you're following playoff hockey. 
[00:51:30]  So go ahead.  Give everybody the news.  Well, apparently he had a lacerated spleen, and he'll be fine.  But...  I ruined the bit.  I ruined the bit.  Bit rooner.  You're such a dick.  The bit was going well, you know.  I know.  I'm a bit rooner.  Yeah, Avery...  He's not playing?  He's not playing anymore?  He's out.  He's out.  What happened?  He had a lacerated spleen?  He's playing in a kind of lacerated spleen. 
[00:52:00]  Turns out a doctor on the paper today said you really want to keep your spleen, because  a lot of people say you can live without your spleen, and there's doctors going, eh, could  cause problems down the road.  They usually take it out to keep people from bleeding.  Right.  You know?  But, eh.  You've got to be in there for a reason, right?  Ah, just like an appendix.  What?  Just like a tonsils.  Yeah, if you don't eat, like, leaves, you don't need it.  Yeah, or rocks or something like that.  That's what they said.  Like, it was there because when cavemen would eat, they would eat a lot of stuff, and then 
[00:52:30]  rocks would end up in there, which kind of end up in your appendix.  Just big rocks.  And we kind of don't eat many rocks nowadays.  They never said rocks.  I heard rocks.  Not even pebbles?  Nah, little pebbles or little rocks.  You would think it would be pebbles.  And tonsils.  Do you know John McCain, when he was in captivity, there was a certain amount, percentage of his  diet that actually had some sort of rock in it?  Really?  He's one of the most hardcore dudes ever.  His story is ridiculous. 
[00:53:00]  Absolutely.  That's why I got to vote for him.  I'm starting to think we owe him the presidency at this point.  Yeah, I think he needs it.  I think we just owe it to him.  Well, I don't know.  I'm also representing a group that might be owed.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Jimmy brings up a point.  I don't know what McCain stands for, but I'm starting to think, ah, maybe we should throw  this guy a bone late in life.  Hey, Mike in Jersey, this was the phone call I wanted to go to, and then we're going to  go back to politics.  Absolutely.  Mike, what do you got?  Yeah, I was at the last game at Veterans Stadium in the Sea of Green. 
[00:53:30]  This yuppie father and mother come with their two boys dressed in a white redskin shirt,  and the guy stands up in front of them, like a conductor of an orchestra, and starts chanting,  bad parents, bad parents, and the whole place started going, bad parents, and they're  sitting there with their little nervous laugh and their voice with their perfect hair cut  and their little turtleneck underneath, right?  And so that, hey, that calms down, right?  Yeah.  And then another drunk guy stands up behind him, like another orchestra conductor, he 
[00:54:00]  starts calling, call Dices, call Dices, call Dices, for like five minutes.  They should have left.  Take their kids away.  Yeah.  Then they made someone else just stay.  All right, you go right ahead.  Sorry, sir.  But the guy's rolling.  Yeah, he is.  Shut up.  They didn't even see the kickoff.  They left.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm telling you, Philly is ridiculous when it comes to their teams.  Very nice.  Call Dices?  What was he saying?  Exactly.  That's what I was trying to, and you know what that meant?  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Oh.  I'll come and take the kids away.  I just, I don't know what it's an acronym for, but I'm sure it's Department of  Something to take your kids away if you're a lousy parent.  All right.  Very, very nice.  All right.  Back to politics.  We wanted to squeeze that call in there.  Hillary's dream date, a Republican.  Huh?  Conspiracy theorist, Delight, we got, Jimmy, Bill's got a,  You're a conspiracy guy.  Oh, yeah.  So, happy birthday.  Buzz into them all.  Just about the first 80% of every conspiracy theory totally makes sense until they get 
[00:55:00]  to the part where they go, and then Bush is an alien, you're like, ah, this guy died.  Ah, you ruined it.  Yeah.  Do you have anything on the Illuminati?  Well, I think they're going to let Obama win.  They're going to let Obama win, because they're going to collapse our economy, and they're going  to need a black guy to blame it on.  Oh, as the fall guy.  Yeah.  Bill is dead serious.  And they'll be like, see, the black guy did it.  He's only half black.  Well, that's the half that did it.  Now, is that to keep black people from becoming president in the future, or is it to keep, 
[00:55:30]  is it to fix the economy by ripping it down to bare bones again?  Yeah, and they'll say, see, we have to exist in a world economy.  What we have to do is now combine with Canada and Mexico and form the North American Union.  Right.  And we'll now all be on the Amero.  The Amero.  And then the brilliance of that is...  The Amero instead of the Euro.  That's good.  Yeah.  They already did it with Europe.  Everybody's on the Euro now.  You got one currency, one group of guys.  They just kind of print that money, and they're going to print that. 
[00:56:00]  It unites.  It kind of unites everybody in cash.  Yeah, they're inching towards the microchips in the back of our heads.  Wow.  I love Bill, man.  I love Bill Perth.  I'm telling you, man, the future.  You mess with the deal.  They're just going to turn off your chips.  That's going to happen.  Hey, what happened to Anthony?  Dude, you hear?  They turned off the chips.  They turned them off last week.  Where were you?  But they're never going to admit that they're turning off chips.  It's going to be a heart attack or an aneurysm or something.  That's how it's going to be explained medically.  They'll just run a trailer of what a D-bag you are, and that'll be it. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  That'll be it.  I like the Amero.  That's pretty good.  Like, we'll get on that standard, and it'll battle with the Euro.  Every once in a while, you'll see somebody on TV talking about it.  Then they go right back to Britney Spears' vagina, and everybody calms down again.  And it's over.  That is great.  I'm buying into that one.  Dude, I can't.  You sold me.  Honestly, I can't read them anymore, and I can't because you start believing the stuff  after a while, and it gets so depressing.  You want to, like, jump out a window because you start formulating. 
[00:57:00]  Okay, well, if they did that, then I'd go into the woods.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't know how to live out there.  Maybe I could go here.  You're not set up for, like, survival in any other kind of world but this one.  I can speak one language.  Yeah.  I can only live indoors.  I don't have any guns.  Like, you can't be a refugee.  I have no gold.  They got me right where they want me.  You have no gold.  I'm done.  Yeah, if you got gold, you could survive anything.  If you got guns, too.  Yeah.  You could take other people's stuff.  You need gold guns, a donkey, and, like, a satchel to carry your gold. 
[00:57:30]  A satchel?  Yeah.  And then just some, like, you know, eight-year-old Honduras kid to be the dude who fetches the  canteen water or something.  Yeah, as your guide.  It's like a Clint Eastwood movie.  I was going to say, you're getting your info from the good, the bad, and the ugly, yeah.  What's wrong with you, Bill?  Then you start banging a girl who pretends she's a nun because she's from L.A. and she's  so phony, man.  Yeah, fake.  That's great.  So, this is the latest on Hillary.  Asked who she'd go out with on a date with any celebrity, living or dead, and Hillary Clinton 
[00:58:00]  chose a Republican.  Wow.  The question, if your husband gave you a pass for one night, this old gag, and you could  go on a date with any celeb, alive or dead, who would it be?  Couples actually play this game, you know.  And then the fat housewife goes, well, I'd pick Brad Pitt.  Would you?  She should have said, like, Wesley Snipes.  Yeah.  Or Yafit Koto.  Yeah, Yafit Koto.  A blacker guy who you know is a pack of horse.  Oh, please. 
[00:58:30]  Hillary's answer.  She says, that's such a dangerous question.  Is it?  How about Abraham Lincoln?  That's who she would have a one night stand with.  What?  Yeah.  I hope on a certain day when he was signing something.  She should have said Eleanor Roosevelt.  That dude.  How bad in bed was Abraham Lincoln?  He'd have to be awful.  Big, boring, gangly, stupid hat.  Big, giant feet hanging off the end of the bed.  They didn't have California kings back then.  All she can do is ride him. 
[00:59:00]  He's just too damn big.  He's giant.  Just like a retard.  I'm going to say he's another guy that was embarrassed of his manhood, too.  Like our own Anthony.  Oh, probably just...  Just freakish in nature.  Packing, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Lincoln.  Yeah, just embarrassing.  He'd make jokes and put his big stovepipe hat on it, and it would take up the whole thing.  He could make the stovepipe hat twitch.  Yeah, well, why do you think the hat was so tall to begin with?  That wasn't a fashion statement.  That was a way of hiding his shame. 
[00:59:30]  Show him the old honest Abe.  He was probably a freak, too.  Grew up all alone in that log cabin out there.  Yeah.  Just alone with his thoughts.  As opposed to Jimmy's log cabin, his bathroom.  He would have cuckold fantasies.  Cuckold fantasies.  Where he wanted just black guys to bang his wife, and she'd be like, but they're not allowed.  He goes, I'll free him.  We're going to make this happen.  I can make this work.  Oh, God.  Come on, we owe them.  Just bend over. 
[01:00:00]  He had the same attitude as the security guard in Goodfellas, but she's like, but who can  not make that happen?  You're looking at him.  Sign a paper.  We'll have four or five of them.  I'm the guy.  You want to hear more on Hillary?  Of course.  This latest dumb interview.  This amazes me about these candidates, that they just don't know basic things in pop culture.  Another surprising tidbit.  Despite the 19-hour day she puts in on the trail, she apparently never heard of the energy  drink Red Bull.  She's never heard of it? 
[01:00:30]  Asked if she's ever had one, she replied, no.  What is it?  She doesn't know what a Red Bull is.  How is she supposed to relate to anything?  Well, she wants a lot of the youth to vote for her, and they're all about the Red Bull.  Did you just say, how can she relate to anything if she doesn't know about that stupid drink?  But it's the dumbest thing I think I've ever heard.  But that's what I mean.  She doesn't know what Wonder Bread is?  That's what I mean. 
[01:01:00]  How can this person run a country?  Exactly.  Yes, you've got to know basic stuff.  That's exactly what I mean, Bill.  You do got to know basic stuff.  You're trying to turn that against me.  I'm saying it's the simple things that people should know about.  I'm with Anthony.  You've got to know basic stuff.  No, you don't.  It scares me.  Yes, you do.  Did you see the video of her trying to like...  She's in the Bilderberg group.  Come on, man.  They don't have time for Red Bull.  The what?  The Bilderberg group.  Uh-oh, what's that?  Bilderberg, is that your...  Something else to be scared of?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  What's this?  I know this group of 100 people.  They meet once a year in a hotel. 
[01:01:30]  It's not a secret who's there.  It's not a secret where they meet or when they meet.  But what they talk about is a secret.  Really?  Because they're nervous that the media that they already own is going to misrepresent what they talk about.  Wow.  That's a good one, huh?  All right.  So they're throwing the N-word around, is what you're saying, pretty much.  I don't know.  No, I think they're talking about the Amaro.  The Amaro?  Yeah.  Well, they're not talking about Red Bull.  Dude, I don't know what I'm talking about.  I love it.  I accept everything you say now.  It's so...  There's such conspiracy going on. 
[01:02:00]  She's from Neptune, okay?  She should know what Red Bull is.  It's on TV commercials.  If the woman doesn't even know TV at all...  Anthony...  She watched the news?  Anthony, you're common.  You're a common person.  They don't have time for you.  They don't have time for us.  We're expendable.  We are so insignificant.  We are.  It just shows you how out of touch these politicians are, though.  Thank you.  When they start talking about violent video games, they don't know what they're talking  about.  Yeah, exactly.  They don't know what they're talking about.  They've never drank a Red Bull.  They've never played GTA, so they don't understand that whole culture. 
[01:02:30]  So don't talk about something you don't know anything about.  It's like hockey.  Oh, by the way, really fast?  I like hockey.  She's a New York senator.  Thank you, Richo, from D.C.  Isn't New York's soccer team, which not a lot of people follow in the soccer, but the  New York soccer team's name is the Red Bulls.  Well, see, that's news to me, too.  No one would know that.  Who knows soccer?  Bill, raise a point, though.  Red Bull is not.  It's like it's common for us, but she's not hanging out with a bunch of listeners who are  drinking Red Bull and vodka. 
[01:03:00]  It's not like it's not even hanging out.  That's what I mean.  It's something, though.  You can't turn on the TV without seeing Red Bull commercials.  Red Bull's been around a while now, too.  And if she's around and if she's out there just shaking hands with a lot of different  people, she had to come across someone with a Red Bull in their left hand.  She gets that senator cable.  Oh, is that a different type of TV?  Yeah, there's no commercials.  You want to hear it?  I love it.  They're watching shows in the future. 
[01:03:30]  See, we don't know yet, but Red Bull's going out of business in 2009.  She's already up to 2011.  Lost season five.  Yeah, I want to watch it.  More about pop culture.  This is why we get frustrated by Hillary.  We've been mentioning this over the years.  She can't answer a question.  Yes, she will not commit to anything.  The latest bunch of questions she refuses to answer.  She refused to choose between comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. 
[01:04:00]  Someone said, who's funnier or who's your favorite, Tina Fey or Amy Poehler?  Because they're in that new movie, Baby Mom or whatever.  It's a good question for a dumb reporter.  Stupid fluff question.  Said she likes both wine and beer.  So she will not choose between, you know, if she likes beer or wine better.  Ask her men or women.  Wouldn't select either American Idol or Dancing with the Stars.  She looks like an old Ellen DeGeneres.  When Ellen's like 60.  Gained a few pounds because she's not on TV anymore. 
[01:04:30]  Hip replacement surgery.  All that happy dancing.  That's stupid dancing.  And then she said her mother, who lives with the Clintons.  Whoa.  Who knew that?  Her mother lives with them?  Whoa.  Yeah.  Boy, you know what that is?  Whoa.  That's Bill having to agree to everything after the Lewinsky thing.  She said her mother.  Yeah, bring your mother in, too.  That's great.  Great, honey.  Love to.  Glad she's here. 
[01:05:00]  God damn.  I hate that.  Two fat bitches around the house.  Nothing, baby.  Bill's a freak.  He'll probably try to hook up with her.  Probably has.  He walks around like tight slacks with no underpants.  Let's mom-in-law get a look.  In sweats.  So it just looks like a tent.  I want to be in the vagina that Hillary came out of.  Speaking of American Idol or Dance with the Stars, she said her mother, who lives with 
[01:05:30]  the Clintons, keeps her up to speed on both programs.  So she's not even watching the hottest shows on TV.  She did, however, choose Weight Watchers over the South Beach diet, but didn't elaborate  on her own eating habits.  Why does South Beach deal with the ass and thighs and feet?  Weight Watchers is waist up, she deals with. 
[01:06:00]  Weight Watchers must be like, gee, thanks.  You're great.  Thanks for choosing us as you look kind of chubby on TV every night.  Tall midget body.  Chatty.  And she also said she never had cosmetic surgery.  People have to decide what's right for them.  It's never been anything I thought was right for me.  That's the latest on Hillary.  She really commits.  I like that.  She had the teeth of a mule inserted.  That was her plastic surgery.  Bill had another part from the mule.  Oh, well, we need this song. 
[01:06:30]  Listen to this.  It's awful.  Ohio, Texas, North Penn State.  She's gonna do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's gonna be your resident.  Hillary Clinton.  Nothing's gonna turn her back now.  Straight ahead and are on a track now 
[01:07:00]  With plans to make our dreams come true  Hillary Clinton  There is nothing she can do  Oh yeah, sing the second verse, keep going  This broad is trying to sell it though, man, she's all in  And vote now, I get it  Dreaming God to know how  With plans to make our dreams come true 
[01:07:30]  Working for us all day  Working for us all day?  You mean when she's campaigning?  And not being senator?  Here comes the big finish  Make all our dreams come true  For me and you  That answer is  Oh, oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh, wow 
[01:08:00]  Dude, that's why no real person can ever run for president  Can you imagine having to sit there during that whole performance  And not in the end just say  That sucked  That sucked  Embarrassing  Terrible  I was embarrassed for you  I was looking down at the floor praying you weren't going to do the fifth verse  You suck at singing  You have absolutely no soul  You picked a theme from a show that's 30 years old  Yeah, kill yourself  So anyways  Yeah, I want to be president  National health care  As your next president 
[01:08:30]  I will  You know how bad the inside of her  I just want to say  When her stockies come off after a 19 hour day  Oh, oh, oh  It must smell like the bank robbing mask of a mackerel  Look, we're not going to do better than that  So listen, let me do this  We got Bill Burr in studio  He's playing Helium Comedy Club down there in Philly  Tonight through the weekend  Make sure you check out Bill Burr 
[01:09:00]  He doesn't get to the East Coast that often these days  So got a nice opportunity to see what Bill's up to  Also, we're not allowed to play Butt Plug  On the radio anymore, Anthony  But it will be up on onaradio.com later today  So you can enjoy that  When we get back  Oh, also I should remind people  Nick DiPaolo come in today as well  And Bear Grylls from Man vs. Wild  Stop and say hi  And right after the break  Another morning zoo bit with Club Soda Kenny  When bad things happen to good people 
[01:09:30]  Next on the O.P. and Anthony Show  Another busy morning  Nick DiPaolo standing by  He's going to be in in a few minutes  We got Bill Burr in studio  He's going to be at Helium Comedy Club in Philly tonight  Through the weekend  Down there in Philly  Go see Bill  You got Jimmy  Heading to Pittsburgh today  Yeah, for tomorrow night  At the Byham Theater in Pittsburgh, PA  You're going to be on a prop plane  Kenny was telling me this morning  No we're not  Not a prop plane  No, no 
[01:10:00]  I told  I was  He's confused  Why am I confused?  You were going to tell Jimmy this after the show?  No, no, no  They do fry  Plot fry  Oh, God  I'd love to make a joke  Exactly  You could get fired for that, you know  I can't get beyond those stupid Miss Meany glasses he's wearing  Oh, I know  Punch them off  You're on a jet  In the emergency roll like you like  Thank you, sweetie  No prop planes for Jimmy  No  No  Not at all 
[01:10:30]  I trust I'm not going to fall out of the sky  But the wind is too bad  Yeah, it really is  He's dressed like Rocky today  Well, that's Kenny's travel clothes  He likes to be casual on travel day  It's really creepy for all of us  That way I could drool on it  He's got his gray hoodie on  He usually wears suits every day  Yeah, I know it's a travel day  When he comes to pick me up in the morning  And he's got, like, that on  When he falls asleep on the plane  And his stupid neck  Is just lolling backwards over the chair top 
[01:11:00]  And his mouth is open so wide  I've never wanted to straddle someone's face so bad  And give them an oniony surprise  Oh, my God  We were going to give Club Soda Kenny the big intro  For his latest morning zoo bit  But, you know, he had to come in early  To make sure Jimmy knows he's not on a prop plane  So you're messing up the timing of this bit  But we'll make it work  That's okay  Of course  Before we get to Kenny  A quick look at weather 
[01:11:30]  Across America  This sums it up right here  Pretty much everywhere  It's going to be hot  Is that it?  Man, I don't need a jacket  Thanks, Arthur  Oh, no  And there's your weather  Yes  Oh, no  What's wrong?  Was that a show done by  Special needs folks?  No  It sounds like it  It really does  It's actually  Kenny down there in Philly  Sent it to me  It's a Haitian weatherman

[01:14:30]  With when bad things happen  To good people  A six year old boy  Was mugged outside  A Florida convenience store  The six year old  Went to the store  To get food for his grandmommy  Two thugs accosted the six year old  And demanded that he hand over  The ten dollar bill that he had  When the boy refused  One of the thugs  Punched him in the face  And took the money  Oh god  Then the boy ran home crying  Look how happy Kenny is 
[01:15:00]  That's horrible  That's a bad thing  Yeah  The boy then returned  A short time later  With his mother  You know  The baby mama  And when they got  To the convenience store  The police were already there  And arresting the thugs  For an unrelated incident  The thugs denied  Beating and robbing the boy  And one thug  Was quoted as saying  I'm gonna stomp your ass  If you press charges  Well that was a bad thing 
[01:15:30]  That happened to a good  Little boy  Yes  Good person  Yeah  Well I mean  You don't know the six year old  That's true  You might be a little  Bastard  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You're gonna love this one  Alright  Alright  Was a woman raped  On the telephone  What?

[01:17:00]  Because the physical  Proximity factor  Is not there  Yet it happened  Because there is  A direct physical impact  The loss of the virginity  Right  Uh oh  This bit's changing  Stephen S. from Bayshore  When bad bits happen  To good listeners  I like that  But I wish it was  A little longer  With more details  A little too long  And where's the  Bad things happen  To good people  How is she a good person  Exactly  That's why I'm having  A hard time

[01:38:00]  I've seen those  Yeah  Yeah that's good  That won't absorb germs  That's a good idea  Yeah nice and spongy  You know the old  Dental chairs  That awful padding  That they would have  Just picture that  Times 10  In the shape  Of a toilet seat  Sitting on a barrel  Goalie pads  Yeah and you got to  Put it on  You got to put it  On your walker  As you're bringing  It up to the  Yeah because the rest  Of the family  Doesn't want to use it  Is this what we  Get looked forward to  Oh my god  No I'm saying  When you buy it  In the store  You just got to  Put it around your neck  Just holding on your walker  Awful things in pharmacies  When you're just 
[01:38:30]  Walking around  And you see  And just go  Oh  Just done  The walkers  And the canes  Yeah they're always  Silver with no paint  On them  The old fashioned  Crutches  You know that go  Around your forearms  The old cripple crutches  Yeah the polio crutches  Polio crutches  And then there's  The little  The cane  That you can't  Even walk with a cane  It has to branch out  Into four prongs  At the bottom  Yeah what is that about  It's like you can't  You can't use one cane  A one pronged cane  Right  Oh then they always have  A cane with training canes  On it  And your shoes 
[01:39:00]  Either come in beige  Or like overcast  Yeah what is that  Put a number  On the back of them  And just tell them  I love those canes  With the four  Yeah the four prongs  On it  Couple of fondue forks  And I'd love to know  How much money  Tennis ball manufacturers  Make for the amount  Of tennis balls  That have to go  On the walkers  For some reason  Cause the old codger  Can't pick it up  They gotta drag it  Along with them  And they put the little  Orange tennis balls  On there  And it's gotta be  Depressing as a person 
[01:39:30]  To sit there  And watch probably  Your son  Or your daughter  Or something  Cut the little hole  In the tennis ball  So they can shove it  On your walker  To get your old ass  Around the house  It's an object  That's used in athletics  But you're using it  So you don't collapse  In the street  Right  So you don't fall down  From walking  You're forgetting  The best one though  How about the walker  With the hand brakes  Yeah there's walkers  With the hand brakes  Just in case it gets  Away from you  Yeah what is that  In case it  In case  In a runaway truck  In case you get up 
[01:40:00]  To a one mile per hour  Yeah you might have  To slow down  You can slow it down a bit  I don't understand  The walker  With the hand brake  That's horrible  And they've put  Like baskets  It's just  It's true that  When you get old  You just do revert  Right back to infancy  Because what was it  When you were a little kid  They'd pop you  In the little walker  And you'd walk around  With the wheels  And then you get old  The same thing  There was a stupid walker  Taking your first steps  Leaning against the coffee table  Yeah  With the straight legs  Yeah you got diapers on

We gotta take a break  The brokerage tonight  Which is what?  Belmore?  Long Island I believe?  I really don't know  I've never been there  Yeah the brokerage in Belmore 
[01:53:00]  Very good club  And Governor's tomorrow night and Saturday  Very nice  Which in Leviton  Which is you know  Alright  We'll have fun  We're gonna continue up next  I think Bear Grylls from Man vs. Wild  Coming to the Opie and Anthony Show  It's the first annual baby throwing contest  Stay tuned for details  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show  We got Bill Barr playing Helium Comedy Club in Philly Thursday, Friday, Saturday  We got Nick DiPaolo at the brokerage tonight and Governor's tomorrow night out there on Long Island 
[01:53:30]  And Saturday  And Saturday  And Governor's Friday and Saturday  Okay  And now Bear Grylls has entered the studio  We got a full house  I hope so  And is the knife a warning not to ask you about staying in hotels or something because  What's that throwing knife? I've got a knife  I think he's had it with questions about hotels because he walked in with this like ridiculous knife that he wanted to show off  Yeah the rambling alligators  It would be nice for you guys to see some of the kit 
[01:54:00]  But anyway there we go  He was showing us how to use a flint like to start a fire  Because I guess people ask you how you start a fire with a knife  And it obviously works because it sparks fire  Well actually the other day I was sitting in the jungle  It was such torrential rain  You know we wouldn't be able to have a conversation  And I was sitting there trying to get a fire going and it just wasn't happening  And I ended up with a load of grass stuffed on my shirt and my pants  Had it up in a ball thinking this is officially no longer fun  So the flint failed me on that occasion  But anyway there we go 
[01:54:30]  You should just bring matches with you  Do you know the first  I remember when I started scouting at age about 4  And the first  My first mission ever  Was that I was given a sausage and a match  One match and told to cook the sausage  And I remember thinking  Well do I light it and hold it over it all  That's been a mad road since then  Did you succeed?  Yeah  No I don't think I did  No  Yeah I had my father give me one of those tests once  He gave me a single shot 22 and one bullet  Because I was camping 
[01:55:00]  And he goes  Here you go  Here's your dinner  I was out in California  Wait what did he do?  What South Central?  Yeah  Wait what did he do?  He gave you  He gave me a single shot rifle  22 rifle  Bolt action  And one bullet  Okay  For dinner  Mother bullet  Now you gotta pull it out  And I had to go out  And I had to shoot a rabbit  And you know skin it  And gut it  And cook it  Jesus  You didn't shoot a rabbit with one bullet  Did you?  In LA? 
[01:55:30]  No it was not LA  It was  It was actually San Juan Capistrano  California  Orange County  Who's your dad?  Davey Crockett  Yeah tell me about it  I actually grabbed a handful of shells when he wasn't looking  And you got dumped them in my pocket  And thank god I did or I would have starved  My first three shots missed the little bunny  Well that's brilliant  I remember the first ever thing  I remember shooting a little robin  I was about six  And I was so excited  I spent hours stalking this thing  Shot it 
[01:56:00]  And I was so upset  I gave it a full funeral  Buried it  Yeah it makes you feel all bad  I felt terrible  But I got over it  I was hungry  Had to eat  And did that knife go through an alligator's skull or something you were saying?  We were just filming in the swamps of Louisiana last week  And I'd wanted to do it  You know do a thing with an alligator  But the brief  I always get a couple of days beforehand  All the search and rescue guys and the rangers  I get a really good briefing on everything  And they said you know  Kind of four or five foot is the maximum 
[01:56:30]  You can realistically sort of you know wrestle  And I found a small three foot one  I could you know  Showing you can only just hold this thing  I thought but  And it was the last day  And I hadn't seen any alligator  And suddenly I just saw one  It was about six and a half seven foot  And I thought it was a bit bigger  You know kind of the briefing was  But it would be great to do  And I got this thing  And they kill by hitting with their tail  And grabbing with their mouth at the same time  Super fast like that  And then once they got you  Then they'll roll and take you down  And so I was behind this thing 
[01:57:00]  Trying to you know stay on its tail  And holding its tail  It was coming around snapping  And eventually you just have to  Kind of take that leap of plunge  And just dive on the thing  And just put all your weight on it  And stop it rolling  And then I got it like that  And I remember I had the knife above its head  And I said to the cameraman  You know Simon  He's done all these shows  And he's brilliant  I go Simon look when I  This knife goes in  This thing is going to go absolutely mad  And it's like your heart's kind of churning  And it sort of works in any way  And then I skinned it ate it 
[01:57:30]  Rubbed the alligator fat in for the mosquitoes  My night there  And then skinned it for cordage for my camp  And the job was a good one  Wait that's how you get rid of mosquitoes  Is alligator body fat?  Yeah it's an old Indian trick  They used to smear all the alligator fat everywhere  And actually it did work  I think it's because you just stink so much probably  But how many bites did you still get?  I mean the mosquitoes they don't  You know actually the bane of my life  This whole man versus wild madness  Has actually been mosquitoes and fire ants  I mean it's always the small things 
[01:58:00]  You know the big things  You're always kind of prepared for  And planned well  But you know if I could lose anything  Out of this whole show  It would be the mosquito bites  Right  But you know we've finished the season now  Cuts and grazes and mosquito bites heal  And it's all good  A little malaria  In New York  I'm actually a big fan of man versus wild  That's some quinine  And the two things that I love that Bear Grills did  Was bite into the live fish  Which was amazing  And you said it tasted like the best sushi you've ever had right?  Yeah yeah 
[01:58:30]  I quite like sushi  He just bit the back off this fish  And the other thing was  I think it was last season  When you were living inside a camel's carcass  Yeah that was a low point  That was disgusting man  Luke Skywalker  Well it's actually  I was with this Berber tribesman  And one of them had said he'd survived by  They got lost in a sandstorm  The only way he survived  Was by killing his camel  Drinking the fluids from its rumen  From one of its stomachs  And then in a sandstorm  Sheltering inside the carcass  So I thought it would be good  To kind of show how you do that 
[01:59:00]  You know it was all this fluid  From its intestines  Was like stinking  I remember getting inside this thing  And I'd skinned it  So I got inside the carcass  And pulled the skin over me  Yeah  And I'm sort of shouting  And this whole thing  Sort of reverberated going  This is how you're sheltering  But actually what was funny  That night  I slept sort of outside  I used the sort of head as a pillow  Yeah  Jesus  Wow  Yeah this is one of the better  This was completely unnecessary  I was on that anti-malaria drug  That makes you hallucinate a little bit 
[01:59:30]  When you kind of have pretty wacky dreams  I kept having these dreams  That this thing's coming back to life  Every time I moved  It would sort of expel air from its lungs  Lungy  Any crap from the animal rights activists  Because you're  They would say you're doing this for a show  Are they giving you any grief  Well this was a Berber tribesman  And they will kill an old camel  Before it dies  So then they can use it  Otherwise if it dies  It's kind of the meat's spoiled  So they will do that anyway  How bad did it smell inside the carcass there?  Yeah bad  I mean that you know  Yeah that  Worst smell ever? 
[02:00:00]  I skinned a big yak in Siberia on this last season  It was eating its eyeballs  And I never realized an eyeball could stink so much  Literally I bit into it  It was like an explosion of blood  Yeah  And like gristle  In its eyeball  It's like Iraq's freshen up gum  That's a little inside  But trust me people out there are laughing  Bear  We had guys come in and eat eyeballs before  And what you don't realize is the lens is all crunchy  The lens is all crunchy and hard 
[02:00:30]  You can't bite that thing down  Yeah yeah  It's actually quite tough an eyeball  I always thought it would be like a hard boiled egg  Right  Depends how old a kid is  There's some kind of like yeah  Like a celluloid in there or something  Yeah all people have those crunchy cataracts  Cellulose  Crunchy cataracts  Yeah  The corneas get crispy  I'm sure you've been asked this a lot  But what's like the craziest thing you've eaten  Or the one thing you will never eat again  Eat again or don't want to eat again  Read around 
[02:01:00]  I was in a  It's a long list you know  Zambia's tomorrow night  We should season launches with that  And there was a  I was going through this dedication treat  Showing how you can eat the grubs  Or feed off the stuff  And I found these quite big ones  And they're wriggling around  And I just finished that  And I was walking off  And as I walked up  I pulled the last bit of dead wood away  And I saw this like monster one  It was literally like  It was that long  Strong  That thick  Wiggling  And it was like  I thought for a second in my mind  Do I show the cameraman 
[02:01:30]  And do this  Or I just leave  I've done the bit  Should we just get on  And I thought  It's too big  I walked down and about five yards  I thought  Oh it's got it  Yeah it'd be great  So I went back and I said  Look come on up  Look at this  This one's been living in here for years  And yeah it was a good bit  And all the blood and sort of pus just explodes over the camera  Oh my god  What was it?  A grub  A big grub  A big sort of maggoty thing  But actually another one was last week  Which actually in the next season was in Mexico  And I got hit by 
[02:02:00]  I got stung by a load of bees  I was trying to get honey out of this nest  And literally my face just ballooned up massive  How were you trying to get honey out of the nest?  You might not get stung  I had a t-shirt around my thing  A smoker  Just a load of wood burning with green leaves around it  I smoked them out  And I got most of it  But they came back  And they just whapped me  And my face looked  I couldn't see out of anything  I looked like the elephant man for half of this show  And I had to kill a big pit viper that night  And Simon was having to sort of direct me to tell me where this thing was 
[02:02:30]  Killed it, skinned it  And then peed inside the skin  Tied a knot in that  Had that round my neck  And then I was in the salt pans  Had to drink the pee out of this snake skin the next day  And it was that sort of mix of sort of warm pee with snake  Day on snake in it  Oh my god  And that was one of the first times I said  Listen, it's time to get a new job  Right, right  God damn  Has there been anything that you refused to do for this show?  Um  Maybe something you were thinking 
[02:03:00]  Alright, I'll do this  And then you backed out last minute and said  No way  Can I do this?  I'm not  I kind of essentially  You know, I love it  It's one thing that really excites me in my life  I really  Love my job  And I've been doing it since I was a kid  It's just I've never been filmed before doing it  And my stuff is often  They're going  We can't do that  We'll never get away with it  So it's too mad  And it's the other way  And I think, you know, I've got  You know, my considerations  I've always got a crew with me  I need to make sure that they can climb this thing  It's not too crazy  It's not going to take too long  And this sort of stuff 
[02:03:30]  Yeah  It's not going to work the other way really  But  I'm much more  I get much more kind of nervous in  Sort of big cities  Or big groups of people I don't know  Or  I'm quite scared of heights a lot  And you know  Those  So it tends to be more those sort of things  That make me more awkward I think  You must be an easy guy to eat out with though  It's okay, what are you in the mood for?  I don't care  Just stops at a dumpster  I'll find something in here  Not picky  You should do an urban version of Man vs. Wild  As a goof  I want to do a 3D feature film next year  Disaster scenarios in New York  And how to basically survive if everything goes wrong 
[02:04:00]  So you're stuck in burning elevators  Your car goes off the bridge under the ice  You get mugged  Your ferry sinks  Your subway gets stuck or whatever  And so that's the plan for next year  It should be great  Would you eat garbage?  And do it kind of like  Would you eat garbage?  I mean there are homeless guys that do it  Could you actually  Would that be like something  You just couldn't get yourself to do?  You know I think that would be okay  You know I mean  None of it that's fun  You know there's no fun eating live snakes  And garbage  You know I'm not  Listen I get home and I just love  My boys make cakes with me 
[02:04:30]  And I love all of that  I have no kind of  Grub cake  I have no sort of nothing to prove  God how good would cake taste  After drinking your own urine out of a dead snake  Listen I get  People go  You must be a nightmare to go on holiday with or whatever  But listen I just love  I love being with my kids  With Bucket of Spade on the beach  Nice mellow times  Sure  My wife looks at me in the bath with all the kids  She goes God if all these people could know how soft you really are with it all  So you know that's my work head  I jump out of that helicopter 
[02:05:00]  And I feel it every time something kind of goes  And you get into that zone of doing what I've been trained to do and what I love  But then I get home and I'm very quickly into normal life  Hey Bear have you ever done  One of the most amazing things I've ever seen is that noodling  You ever do that?  I did it literally last week  Really?  Oh in Louisiana probably right?  I got a big 30 pound catfish  Do you want to explain noodling?  This is  That's so weird  This separates the men from the boys  Hell yeah  If you think you're a tough dude  But again I had this briefing and they said  Listen you will 
[02:05:30]  If you do some noodling and get into something big  You will know about it  And what you do  You go  So it's up to your waist  And under all of these trees  And all the roots  The big catfish  Big snapper turtles  Hides  And you put your hand right in  You just hope that you don't get a little gator  Right in these holes  You can't see a thing because it's the swamps  No way  I got a knip  Can you imagine?  I'd been doing it for about an hour  And eventually I got a knip from something  And I thought  Ow!  Something's in there  And I went in again  And what you have to  You have to commit to it  Because it swallows your whole arm 
[02:06:00]  You get it right down  So it's up to here  And then you just grab it  And pull out  Give him your old pink sock  Your pink sock again  But it's one of those  And I hadn't really  I kind of thought this would be fine  Smells better  And then the cameraman Simon said to me  He said  Bear listen I would never do this  This is one thing  I could not  You know I've watched you do a lot of things  This would terrify me  And as soon as he said that  I thought  He's right  I can't do this  You know  And I hadn't really thought about it before  I suddenly kind of got the fear of it  And I just had this nip  You know  But I went for it  And this thing just clamped on 
[02:06:30]  And their jaws are like  Real sandpaper  What is it?  Catfish  I mean they're giant  The anticipation of waiting  For something to bite your arm  Would be like  I could not even  The people step on them  The people step on them  Until you're in the mud  Yeah definitely  We were stepping on lots of baby  Alligates and stuff  And catfishes  Just walking around a swamp  That's crazy  But can you imagine  Putting your arm in one of these holes  And waiting  No way  Something to bite you  Something huge  And then yank it  I'm not doing it again 
[02:07:00]  That's my noodling career over  And they're making this illegal  In a lot of places  Because that's how they  They fish for the catfish  It's the easiest way to get them  I'd rather just  No  Not a very nimble fish  It literally strips the skin off your fingers and stuff  It's not fun  Not a very nimble fish  You can catch a fish by grabbing his appendix  Well no  Cause they're stuck in there  They're wedged in  These little kind of root canals  Yeah here's a  I guess a video  That somebody found  Of someone noodling  There you go 
[02:07:30]  Look at that  That's insane  There you go  That's exactly it  Put that video up on onaradio.com  That's crazy  He's got some sort of glove on it  I mean that was a baby one  You know  There you go  That's more how it is  Did you use a glove or anything?  Did you use a glove or anything?  Did you use a glove or anything?  No  Look that's exactly how it is  You've got your neck right now  But it's a good  Why would you do that?  You nailed it though  The anticipation of the fear has got to be just  I don't know how you can handle that  It was a real case  I hadn't really thought about it until  The cameraman goes 
[02:08:00]  But it's the one thing I couldn't do  Oh my god  How do you know there's not  Don't they have like poisonous snakes  Like water moccasins and stuff like that?  A lot of water moccasins  All you know is the water moccasin  Yeah  In the water  That's the only one I know  That's Billy's  That's Bill's like extent to his  No but I just  It's just always like the water moccasin  Yeah  Bill's a nature hack  They're horrible snakes  They just caught them out  They got something poisonous  Like a rattlesnake  One of them sidewinders  Diamond head  What was that again Bear?  I was just saying they're the only 
[02:08:30]  One of the few snakes that will go for you  So in the swamps generally as you move  You'll see a snake  Fall off and just disappear  But the water moccasins have a white mouth  And you'll see it come out  Open the mouth at you  That's crazy  Those ones you need to do a lot of  Get out of the way you brute  You see any of those  What are they down there?  Tasmanian devils or whatever  They got those people that believe  That there's some weird creature in the swamps there?  No just a few of the kind of hillbilly rangers  Who are doing our stuff  Wow  So obviously Man vs Wild Louisiana  Where else do you go this season? 
[02:09:00]  Well actually that's for the next next season  But this season we did two shows  Oh you're already a season ahead?  Yeah  Wow  The first one was two shows in Siberia in wintertime  Daily minus 35  And actually that was one place  A lot of the guys who sort of seem to enjoy the show  Said they would love to see you go to Siberia in winter  And it is tough there where  You know there's not a lot of room to make mistakes in minus 35  So that was a tough one  We did two in Indonesia  We did a swamp one  And then a desert island one  And then we did two in Africa  Which is tomorrow night Zambia and Namibia 
[02:09:30]  Zambia was interesting with that  I got ate a bit of a dodgy snake  And got really bad diarrhoea  And a  Dodgy snake  And I was halfway up a rock face  I was half a 90ft big waterfall  And I had to go  Isn't it like Willy Wonka's joint?  Oh no  Seriously I had to go  And I set the camera  And I said turn the camera off  I've got to go  Oh no  And there's this shot where I'm hanging  We're like one arm  Trying to pull my trousers down  Doing diarrhoea into free air  You know  Thinking this  You know 
[02:10:00]  Chocolate rain  But  Yeah  Oh my god  He had to go as he stood  Doesn't he do  I hope they didn't  I hope they didn't dump out of that  But you know  He's hanging  And he had to go  And so he did  They did do number two  Wow  They fuzzed the actual ground  That's hilarious  That's a good Pepto Bismol commercial  Yeah right  No you know  They always do that thing about how human beings are ruining the environment  They always show bulldozers knocking over trees  That just would have been a great clip  Some guy hanging from a waterfall  That says it all 
[02:10:30]  The tail just coming out of the back  Says it all  Hey Bear  What is the number one thing you've done  I don't want to say craziest again  But like the one thing that really impresses people when you tell them I did that  Is it the Mount Everest climb or  I don't think Everest was that  You did  Everest was special for me  It had been a mountain that had been such a big part of my life since I was growing up  And you know it had a cost you know we lost four people up there  And I think it sort of rocks your confidence a little bit that 
[02:11:00]  But I'm proud of my kids they're cool  I love this show you know  These shows especially I'm really proud of these ones  We've you know we've gone to some of the toughest locations we've ever filmed in  You know the crew I've got the same crew now  It's taken me a while to really build the right guys for this  And they're brilliant you know they're real unsung heroes all of this  They put up with some seriously sort of beef conditions  Right  And it's been tough you know the cold and the heat 
[02:11:30]  And we were in Sumatra where these crocs where the tsunami hit  And all of this lowland just dropped  And it's all now this black swamp  And it's full of these man-eating crocs  Been feeding off 65,000 human corpses after the tsunami hit there  So they've seriously got the taste of it  I've seen it for five days in this place  And it's like  The hard thing there is dodging these you know nasty crocodiles  Hey how do you pitch a show like that?  I mean you got to take it to the next level from the last guy 
[02:12:00]  You know what I mean?  Well they kind of  I never  Genuinely I never wanted to really get into TV  I was doing my stuff  I was in the army  I was doing my expeditions  And Discovery came three times  The producer came and said  Can we just do a film where we drop you in somewhere  Film  Show us how you get out of things  And I  If I'm honest I don't really have the confidence  I don't think to do TV  I thought I can do my stuff  And I  I haven't got white teeth  And I'm not sort of good looking and fit  I just  Oh come on  I didn't feel like that  And I said no three times  Fishing for compliments now  And he said eventually 
[02:12:30]  Hey you know I'm just a regular bloke  He said  Noodling for compliments  He's doing that Hugh Grant modesty  I don't buy it  No I'm not buying it either  Every girl  Every girl in America wants to bang this dude  Yeah they just keep giving me movies  It's never like that  I don't see that side of it  But listen he said  You don't need to be a slick host  You don't need to be smart  All tidy  All together  Just do your stuff  Whether it works  Whether it's covered in mud or whatever  The failures  The good, the bad, the ugly  Just stick your arm  And we did it  And it kind of worked from there  But it's  What amazes me  That lawyers haven't gotten involved 
[02:13:00]  And messed this show up  All right  Like they do everything else in entertainment  The liability  That's a liability issue  Hey we got to get out of here  We're running out of show  But we haven't even really promoted the book  It's a man versus wild book  Which obviously  Self-explanatory survival techniques  From the most dangerous places on earth  There's a lot of the kind of  You know  Each show for us takes six days to film  And it gets condensed down to an hour  And the book's a lot of the kind of  You know  Other stuff that we  You know  I've used behind the scenes stuff 
[02:13:30]  And how we  Get out of trouble basically  It's actually cool  It's almost like a social studies book  It's like a big heavy  Color  Like a lot of photos  And you know  Our listeners like photos  Yeah  It's a good book  For the bathroom  Sit on the loo  And kind of read about how to  Survive snake attacks  How to  How to bite into a zebra  Snodling  All of that good thing  Sit on the loo  This is really good  Yeah look at this picture  Him just biting into a zebra  What the  Yeah there's a photo  You know this is what kills me  They tell me that 
[02:14:00]  Oh you better wipe down  You had raw chicken on the table  This guy's chewing on a zebra's ass  He's fine over here  That's cause they didn't  Cut it's nose off  And stick it in like a little  Two foot by two foot zebra cage  I think that's where you get the salmonella from  It's those little cages  He's eating rats ass  He's fine  We have to go on  Bear Grylls from Man vs. Wild  Thank you for stopping by  We appreciate it  And the book is called Man vs. Wild  Survival Techniques from the Most Dangerous Places on Earth  What channel?

[02:15:00]  So you get to see two shows shot  When you go  Alright we'll see you  Jimmy on Monday  Bear once again  Thank you  We're off to XM  You guys have a great day  It's the first annual bee throwing contest  The Opie and Anthony show  Stay tuned for details  The Opie and Anthony show  XM 202  In the world of radio shock jocks  The biggest are Opie and Anthony  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office 
[02:15:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice  Why? Why does radio out of any other medium have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good  Shock jocks  Go screw  Radio Bad Boys Opie and Anthony  Controversial radio personalities Opie and Anthony  Infamous DJs Opie and Anthony  Talk show radio host Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony 
[02:16:00]  Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah!  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator with all these problems?  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[02:16:30]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  XM Satellite Radio.  I want to start by saying fuck you to Anthony Cumia.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  What did I do?  You got me good, actually. 
[02:17:00]  I walk out of CBS and...  Are they here?  It's cool.  I mean, they're fans of the show.  They gotta expect this.  They gotta understand.  I usually lag behind between the two shows because I go down the hall.  Whatever.  I just do my dump thing and I use their bathroom and I usually lag behind.  And so I leave the building and there's two fans with their eyes wide open and they have  hoodies on and they're just waving at me.  I'm like, what the fuck is this about?  Usually, like, the fans, like, leave with whoever leaves the building first. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  Right.  And I'm like, hey, what's up?  You know?  And they go, well, they told us to wait for you.  They were waiting out there when me and Kenny went out and apparently when Jimmy first  went out.  So when me and Kenny went out and then they go, so do we walk over with you?  And I said, I go, no, you know, Opie's coming down soon.  He'd love to, you know, walk over with you.  They go, okay.  And then I walk over with Kenny laughing.  And then the whole time. 
[02:18:00]  Knowing that Opie would have the uncomfortable walk with the listeners.  And the whole time.  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  Do you know how many times I've walked out and they're like, wait, wait, and I'm like, oh, yeah, dude, O&A  are coming, right?  Do you know how many times I've made it look like this?  Just hang around, guys.  It's about to get good.  Hey, what was the wrap it up phrase you kept using?  I had to have bro in it.  All right, bro.  Thanks, man.  All right, bro.  Yeah, bro.  I ran in front of a city bus to cut us off. 
[02:18:30]  I was able to get in front of the city bus and it was making the right turn.  A couple of paralyzed fans.  No, they're cool.  We met them, actually, Jimmy, at a Starbucks before your HBO taping down in Washington.  Fascinating.  Did we talk to them?  Well, you met them.  Well, I guess I should say fuck you to you, too, because they go, remember we met you and  Jimmy at the Starbucks before his taping?  I'm like, yeah.  They said, you know, we talked to you, but I guess Jimmy had something that he had to  do because he ran out of there.  No, they're not here yet. 
[02:19:00]  They're coming out.  I actually do remember.  They were coming out.  I probably, the minute they said, hey, dude, we drove down from, I fucking ordered a cookie  and fucking made like a banana and split.  Why would any listener come by and hang with us with this attitude we have?  I know.  We're just awful.  They're petrified on the bleachers right now.  Like, please don't pick on me.  The last time I was here, it worked out.  There was a couple of fans waiting for you.  Remember who?  The kid with the guitar and his girlfriend?  Oh, right.  Remember?  Oh, you were here for the belly dancer.  Yes.  Fucking A. 
[02:19:30]  That wouldn't work.  That was hot.  You have a career.  I know.  I never get any boxers.  Her video's up on opianathlete.com.  Her getting naked and doing a fake orgasm for us.  Very, very sweet.  And people are going, oh, if DiPaolo wants to rape her, my wife's watching this shit on the entire  show.  Gotta go home and deal with that shit.  I'm like, she sucks.  She had a pot belly and a mustache.  Shut up.  I've gotten yelled at so many times for fucking things I've said.  I was talking to some strippers, and I was like, I'd fuck you.  If my girlfriend died, I'd fuck you at a funeral.  It was so awful.  Alicia mentioned you had a girlfriend.  Exactly. 
[02:20:00]  You know what I mean?  They don't see that part of it.  And I would be at the funeral, telling me I wouldn't go.  You know what I mean?  Nick takes his ring off on the radio.  Where am I supposed to?  You know, I never do.  I don't take this fucking thing off.  Even on the road, though, I don't take it off.  We're just making jokes, man.  In case Nick DePaul's wife is...  Girls love married guys.  It's a challenge, right?  That's why I leave it on.  I know my buddies at Takeover.  What are you doing, man?  They leave it on?  Yeah.  They know your cock works.  It's like in Departure and Alex Baldwin gives that speech. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  They know you're married.  You know you got money.  They know your cock works.  People say you're not a homo.  Yeah, people say it on a...  How funny we're saying it.  His homo is just hilarious.  Can I give a quick plug before I forget?  Yes, Jimmy.  Bear Grylls is going to do a book signing at 1 o'clock.  I promise I'll do it.  Borders on Wall Street, 100 Broadway here in New York.  This afternoon, you can go meet Bear and get your book signing.  Ah, that's...  Get on the other side.  Just in case you forgot.  He was cool.  Is he going to eat a cashier while he's down there? 
[02:21:00]  Video.  There's your belly dancer there.  Remember her?  She's fucking hot, man.  Remember her?  From the last time, yeah.  Oh, look at how she moves her.  You weren't there?  You weren't here, Jim?  It was a girl without a top.  Hey, there's the...  They made it upstairs.  Ah, there they are.  Hey, how are you?  Jackie Coogan and his lovely wife.  Jackie Coogan.  Jackie Coogan.  Here's a reference point.  It's a 100-year-old reference.  Yeah, but it's perfect.  You know, we're making fun of them.  It is.  Yeah.  Jackie Coogan.  Yeah, he knows.  He had the little Uncle Fester face.  Thank you guys for coming.  I do remember you from Starbucks. 
[02:21:30]  I actually do remember you.  Did Jimmy talk to you at Starbucks?  He didn't, right?  No.  Yeah, you did.  Why would he?  So how long are you going to be on Mars?  Two weeks.  Oh.  Teasing, of course.  Did you fire a biscotti?  Yeah.  Was it weird wearing the helmet in the first two Star Wars?  Oh.  Oh.  What's wrong with that?  Not that.  Because Vader's a great character.  Solar plexus.  It was a good solid guy.  You are the Duke of New York.  You're a number one.  Hey, Bill.  We couldn't get into it because the show was way too fast on the other side today. 
[02:22:00]  We couldn't get into some deep discussions.  But since the last time you were here, Anthony has bought another six guns.  So I just wanted to give you the update.  I think that's a great thing.  I'm actually into guns now.  What?  That should be.  That should be.  That should be.  That should be.  What happened?  I've been reading conspiracy theory.  Yeah?  Oh, you're buying them for the wrong reason.  Well, let me finish.  Then I went, I started hiking like half the fag that I am out there.  And I realized the second you get into nature, guns totally make sense.  The second you get alone, you get away from the herd, and you just feel like, man, I need 
[02:22:30]  a stick.  And that's why.  I need something.  Do you hike into Hollywood Hills and all that?  Yeah.  That's why I need guns in LA.  It's not downtown.  And you don't read the signs before you.  You don't read the signs before you.  It always ends up in South Central.  Goddamn right it does.  They end up in Beverly Hills.  You're not going to get attacked by a fucking lion at the ATM machine on Sunset.  They have all these warning signs that no one reads before they go hiking.  And coming out of one of these hikes, I read the sign and said, beware of what? 
[02:23:00]  Bobcats and...  Yeah, mountain lions.  Mountain lions.  And you're like, I was just fucking hiking where a mountain lion could have possibly...  Cholos.  Yeah, but they tried to say that there hasn't been any mountain lions up there since the  1940s.  That's baloney.  Somebody was doing like a horseback ride, and they said this thing was following them.  And then they went into this tunnel under this bridge, this man-made bridge, and the  thing wouldn't follow them in there.  And they were like, there's no way, there's no way you should...  They were like, you sure it wasn't a coyote?  Turns out...  And they were like, dude, the thing's tail was like eight feet long. 
[02:23:30]  We know what the hell it was.  And they tried to...  Was it threads?  They tried to say it came down like the...  If I could just get through the races banner here.  Somebody auditioning for the Wiz.  Plow through it.  Just swim through the races.  I mean, get to the end of this race.  Bill, I'm with you so far.  You're with me?  I am.  You know what?  I just lost...  You sure it wasn't a panther?  I just lost all the momentum.  No.  They tried to say maybe it came down the L.A. River or something like that, because they  got like trees in there.  I didn't buy it.  They do have like canyons that lead into the city.  A lot of them take the tram. 
[02:24:00]  Well, they have a bobcat attack to it, and the only way to stop it was to suck its dick.  Like he climbed up on your shoulders, and you knew what he wanted to do.  Jimmy.  What?  You're not the suckers?  It just gives you that look like you have a choice there.  Yeah.  Mauled to death.  He's on your shoulders, like just pushing it in your face, and you're like...  I got it.  I got to do this.  I imagine it's not gay, because it's not human, and it's for survival.  Absolutely.  You're all shit.  It's still a dick. 
[02:24:30]  So, Bill, the guns.  Guns, uh...  Bob.  This is very surprising.  I didn't think you would ever buy a gun.  Oh, well, yeah.  I'm like most people.  I jump back and forth as far as the, uh...  You know, the right and left kind of thing.  Yeah.  Everybody tries to act like everybody's either on one side or the other.  Yeah.  No, you're not.  Right?  I wasn't into guns for a while.  Guns scared the shit out of me just because I didn't grow up with them.  But I got to admit, I did the improv in Houston, and, you know, it's Texas.  They just grow up with those things.  That's like a hula hoop for those guys just having a pistol laying around.  You know why?  Houston is nearby. 
[02:25:00]  Go ahead.  Yes.  Just keep treading water.  So, then, I ended up getting, all right, here we go.  Keep my head above water.  Keep your head above the water here as you swim.  No, I went shooting.  It was awesome.  I really can see why people are into that stuff.  I'm waiting for the Anthony invite.  I want to shoot some rifles, man.  Well, rifles you could shoot.  In New York, you can't shoot pistols unless you have a license.  Unless we go in your basement.  No, I don't shoot in my basement.  I know.  That's against all friggin' laws.  Of course.  We all know that at this point.  It's all laws.  Yeah.  You can't shoot them.  What are you going to do?  Like a kitchen? 
[02:25:30]  I can't see.  I just blast a few rounds off of back.  No.  At your Elvis plates?  I go to the range.  I go to the range.  It's nice.  It really kind of blows off some steam.  I think it's something you should know how to do.  But it's racist that they have those black targets, the silhouettes of black.  That's racist.  It should be a white thing on a white background.  Yeah, but it's the shape of Jerry West, though.  That's how they get away with it.  It's the NBA logo. 
[02:26:00]  Fucking Jerry West.  I went out yesterday.  Stupid Jerry West.  Changed the logo.  He hasn't played in 40 years.  The place is called South Shore Sporting Goods.  Yeah?  And I went there to pick up some things.  And a fan was there.  But I didn't know he was there until he spoke up.  Until he shot him by accident?  His first words to me is, you're a crazy fuck.  Because I guess I'm trying to make a fashion statement with 5.11 tactical wear. 
[02:26:30]  I see that.  I'm really trying to make it catch on as a fashion thing instead of just something that police and militia wear.  Are you joining the Sandinistas?  What's going on over there?  That's what I'm trying to do.  To me, it feels very comfortable.  Yeah, I mean, I'm like Fidel Castro wear.  You dress like you should be talking somebody down off a bridge.  But it's very handy, because look at this.  Don't pull any guns out.  No, I don't have it. 
[02:27:00]  You just scared the shit out of me.  There is a built-in holster right here on your pocket.  Instead of, you know, it's the pocket, but underneath the pocket, right there, Velcro.  You just open that thing up, and boom.  And boom.  Was that the selling point for you?  Hell yes!  It just kind of looks like a Mashed shirt.  Hell yeah!  I'm really not into it.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  You know, I like it.  I like the whole look.  You gotta have the army hat.  And, of course, my...  Those are nice stompers. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, Teroleans.  I'd wear those.  These are my stompers.  Aren't they good?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  When did you get all this?  Yesterday.  Yeah.  I picked up something.  And this, too, has got...  It's like Robert Yurik at a yard sale from the SWAT.  It's got the same gizmo in here.  It's a hidden pocket, basically.  Because if you see Anthony's shirt, it just looks like a basic pocket.  But then you rip the side open, and you can grab a gun.  I gotta say it again.  He's been wearing this 5'11 hat, and I wasn't even going for the joke. 
[02:28:00]  Look, I thought he was representing a lesser terrorist attack that happened.  Something that happened.  I had no idea.  He forgot about Cinco de Mayo.  The one in Britain.  Yeah.  They pull up the subway.  Anthony's, like, making a statement.  You know, fuck, 9-11's getting all this attention.  Let's not forget about 5-11.  5-11.  But it's all tactical.  I learned that.  But I'm trying...  You taught me that yesterday.  I'm really trying to make it a fashion statement.  Yeah.  You should.  I'm just going to wear this stuff.  You can land a commercial or something.  Yeah, you know.  Next thing you know.  That's how it happens.  Like, how does, like, the hip-hop community, how do they start wearing something that becomes 
[02:28:30]  popular when it's not supposed to be worn by, like...  Well, it starts with shoplifting.  You don't want to heal, honey.  The house next door to me.  Speak of the devil.  Oh, this is a great story, actually.  Obama's wife got a talking-to from Obama.  Good.  What do you mean?  What's the story?  Ed knew this one.  Yesterday, I was looking at a little clip of a little get-together that Obama and his 
[02:29:00]  wife were having with some people, potential voters.  He was sitting on a picnic bench.  Yeah.  Very loose.  You know, very...  Very Forrest Gump-ish.  Informal.  Yeah.  And they asked him about the Reverend Wright, and he said he gave his speech about it and  realized, you know, the guy's absolutely wrong.  He doesn't support what he says.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then he turned to his wife and said, do you have anything to say on this?  And his wife kind of looked like she was thinking for a split second, and he went... 
[02:29:30]  He shook his head no and said, well, she's got some things to say, but there are a lot  of reporters here.  Yeah, he actually said that to her.  He heshed her up.  That's actually worse.  And then he clocked her in the eye.  And you can't even tell.  I can't even believe they made such a big deal out of that bullshit anyways.  It's like, who gives a shit?  The Reverend Wright thing?  Yeah, who gives a shit?  What do you mean?  Stop with that shit.  Fucking McCain.  You fucking...  First of all...  If McCain was talking to a guy that was in a Klan... 
[02:30:00]  A Klan member.  I'm not swearing.  Why are you swearing?  That guy Wright is a separatist, racist asshole.  Dude, my priest was fucking children.  Exactly.  Yeah, give a fuck.  Exactly.  You know what I'm saying?  You're a priest, twins.  My fucking...  Exactly.  The church I came from...  If McCain's fucking mentor, religious guy, was a kid fucker, it's over, Johnny.  It's over, that's all.  It's over.  This guy married him to his wife, baptized all his fucking kids, did everything.  Such a non-story. 
[02:30:30]  Oh yeah, non-story, my dad.  Now he's making it sound like, I don't know, I went into church once a week and saw the guy  up there.  This guy was his fucking religious and spiritual leader, and he's fucking in that church every  weekend, blurting out his racist bullshit.  He's not who he is.  It's all bullshit.  Bullshit.  Oh, Billy.  Dude, this is what they do.  Anybody who runs for office...  I'm gonna raise you a bullshit.  Anybody who runs for office, they just dig up shit up.  Yeah, of course.  And it's just shit.  But it's just shit.  This is shit. 
[02:31:00]  It's just shit.  It's real shit.  It's real shit, Billy.  It's just shit.  Okay, if McCain says it, if McCain is spiritual...  If they did it to him too, I wouldn't give a fuck.  Don't tell me this is not a double standard, though.  He's still in the race, Obama.  If this was McCain and he was hanging out with a Klansman, it would have been over.  No, no, but McCain's been busted because he refers to Asians as the dukes.  Just the ones that tortured him.  He goes, and I'm not gonna stop calling him that.  And in my head, I'm going, well, here's a guy, if anybody has...  Can you really compare that to a spiritual man? 
[02:31:30]  Okay.  To a guy who actually is...  I'm not saying that that's...  This guy is right, either.  I'm gonna go on this one.  I'm just saying it's bullshit.  I don't give a fuck what the people around them are doing.  Double standard.  I don't care, either.  Who you hang out with has a lot to do with who you are.  It does, but it's weird in America that we're mad that a black guy knows another black  guy who's mad at white people.  This guy listened to him spew venom in that church, which, by the way, happens every fucking 
[02:32:00]  Sunday in every state, all over the place.  Which is all right.  Because you go to these churches?  No, I just know.  You're just making this shit up.  I fucking knew what you were doing.  Don't be so fucking naive.  And then it all ends up in Compton.  They hate us.  It all ends up in Compton.  No, no, no.  There is hate speech going on in these churches.  Reverend Wright, he raised a good point.  The same people that are saying that he's not patriotic, use their privilege to avoid  the guy who's a fucking S-Marine.  I'm not saying that wasn't a valid point.  As much as he says shit that I don't like, I don't care about Obama's association with 
[02:32:30]  him.  It doesn't matter to me.  Dude, they just come up with shit.  They just come up with shit.  If it was the other way around, it wouldn't matter.  Wait, wait, wait.  John McCain's pastor has said some crap, too.  Huggie, I think his name is.  Yeah, we're looking it up right now.  He said he likes little freckles on boys and noses.  Supposedly, he said God punished New Orleans with Katrina.  Yeah.  And then something about gays in 9-11.  Yeah, that's the same thing.  They all know fucked up people.  He wasn't a spiritual mentor, okay?  Yeah.  This guy fucking spiritual mentor.  Now you want to talk about double standard to me. 
[02:33:00]  If his priest is a fucking whack job, too.  That's just your priest.  Who gives a shit?  No, religion is all bullshit anyway.  Billy, it's not just his priest.  He says he was like an uncle to a family.  It's the guy that fucking converted him from Muslim.  And he fucking baptized his kids.  He married them.  It's not just his fucking priest.  Nick, Nick, I'm friends with you.  Yes.  Look at you.  What about me?  You're a fucking maniac.  You're a fucking maniac.  And you'd never be able to run for president, Bill.  That's got nothing to do with me.  I hope black people.  Exactly.  I wouldn't be.  I wouldn't be.  And what was... 
[02:33:30]  Dude, I'm talking about going hiking and you start trashing people in Compton.  It had nothing to do with it.  It had nothing to do with it.  It had absolutely nothing to fucking do with it.  I can't joke.  See, now you're comparing two comedians joking around with what goes on in the white house.  You bring up pay.  You ever play that board game Monopoly and all of a sudden it's like, fucking Spanish Harlem.  That's right.  Those jigs on board.  Yeah.  Fucking stuff.  Yeah.  But I'm still friends with you.  What the fuck does that have to do with me?  Nothing.  Because I'm not running...  You're not running for president, you fuck nut.  And I'm not anybody that would give a fuck about. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, you really compare in a relationship with a guy who's running for president and his fucking priest.  You should run, Bill.  I'm joking around.  I'm saying...  I love Wally Collins as much as you do and Ralph Harris.  Awkward.  No, but I'm saying if...  But this is the thing, dude.  But if I ran, they would bring up this bullshit, which is total bullshit.  Because you just...  Idiot.  It's not the same relationship, Bill.  I'm not your spiritual mentor.  First of all, put your eyebrows down.  You understand?  Okay.  Model.  Oh, negative control.  What does that mean?  Put your eyebrows down.  Why are you wearing some fucking eyebrows? 
[02:34:30]  Oh.  That one's got to hurt, Bill.  A little bit.  What do you mean?  I heard that one in third grade.  Oh.  It's an old one.  The yellow eyebrows?  Yeah.  When you have them, when you're born with them, you know, you tend to hear it.  No.  Every kid I've ever fought when I was in grade school had blonde eyebrows and blonde eyebrows.  Every fist fight I ever had, a kid had blonde eyebrows.  I agree with Nick 100% on this one.  What a surprise.  It's a double standard.  Really?  That's what's angering.  Seriously, Billy.  That is what is angering. 
[02:35:00]  You're a hating white man.  I'm not.  You really are.  You're afraid of the truth.  These people have to be called on the fucking rug.  Oh, you know what?  Because I don't agree with him.  I'm afraid of the truth.  There's a truth out there that isn't being acknowledged.  Nick, you said a lot of things today, and I didn't have a disagreement with it.  This is just one thing.  I'm just saying.  Anyways.  Uh-oh.  Let's talk about the Red Sox.  We can talk about the Bruins.  You both like the Bruins.  I know that much.  They're out of it.  I don't want to talk about that.  You guys were excited about that game six?  You were saying it was one of the greatest, what, Bruins games in the last 15 years or 
[02:35:30]  something?  47% say Reverend Wright makes them concerned about Obama's values.  Oh, boy.  47% of people poll.  Wow.  Is that a poll?  Yes.  Yeah, because I remember when they called me.  See, you're represented by other people.  You're not that important, Bill.  Oh, that's what it is.  That's what it is.  You're one person.  You're a fucking number that is represented by another number.  Yeah, there we go.  Hold on.  There we go.  And you got to agree with Bill Burr on that one because, you know, the ratings thing.  Hey, yeah.  Wait a minute.  You're right.  We agree with you, Bill.  I don't agree with polls.  Obama has an easy relationship with just Reverend Wright, who is fucked up, but Bush has a relationship 
[02:36:00]  with the Bin Ladens.  Every politician has shitty connections with other people.  The Bin Ladens weren't bad people until one of the sons decides to fucking blow up.  Yeah, but one of the black sheep of the family's sons decides he's going to blow up the fucking  world.  Yeah, but he was still in this.  Before that, there were oil people.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  The other oil people had to deal with.  Yeah, they're all scumbags.  Anthony, that guy's been a terrorist for a long time.  Oh, I know.  All right.  And they were still friends with him.  Not friends with him, but they were still friends with the family.  The family, because they're fucking oil people dealing with other oil people. 
[02:36:30]  They're all scumbags.  Meaning you always have...  Meaning, but I'm saying, and that would still be bullshit.  So I'm saying it's all bullshit.  They just...  Okay.  So he'll never be president of the oil people.  Anybody can run, no matter what.  I want to interrupt, because I don't want to lose this caller here.  John in Miami, he says, I want to talk to Anthony, the racist motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Okay.  This should be good, John.  This should be right.  Open-minded.  Anthony, you talk about racists.  You lay your neo-Nazi head down on your pillow every night, and you're basically looking 
[02:37:00]  for a reason not to vote for a black man.  That's the bottom line.  I'm looking for a reason.  You know something?  If it was a white guy with the same values and positions that he holds, I wouldn't vote  for him either.  I don't like his tax-the-shit-out-of-me, get-rid-of-my-guns stance.  Sorry.  Not the fact that he's black.  Well, you know what's amazing is, if you look at the...  The media basically is providing all this information, because they don't want a black 
[02:37:30]  man for president.  What?  The fucking media?  You are fucking high, sir.  Holy shit.  You watch NBC, CBS.  What are you fucking watching?  They fawn over this guy.  They fawn over him.  Christ, that guy was feeling bad for Hillary Clinton.  Why are you fucking nitwink?  The bottom line is they want Hillary running against McCain, because they figure McCain can  beat Hillary.  That's the bottom line.  That's the definition of neo-Nazi, by the way.  Because they're both in the Bilderberg group.  Get it straight. 
[02:38:00]  There's no neo in front of it.  There you go.  Wait, wait, they're fucking...  I'm a Nazi, not a neo-Nazi.  By six points, by the way.  Wait, they want fucking McCain to win, so they're pushing...  I don't...  They've been very good to Obama.  The media's been very good to him.  Oh, my God.  To say the least.  They really haven't.  They've been good to...  I mean, why would you continue to play this crap for the last six weeks?  Because the media...  I gotta say, you're wrong, dude.  Fucking news.  This guy is giving them sound clips.  I can't talk about this.  Yep.  When you give sound clips, like Jeremiah Wright's giving, how can they not play...  They played Imus' one comment for six months. 
[02:38:30]  You give them sound clips like this, and brand new ones, they can't help but run with it.  Yeah, no, they're impartial.  I mean, it's really not what's important in our economy.  Maybe you're right.  Yeah, it is.  It's a fucking...  If the guy's gonna be running for President of the United States, his character is important.  You're falling for the...  That's hilarious.  They're all...  Everybody's fucking flawed.  George Bush is a...  They're all flawed, Billy.  So why the fuck shouldn't we go after Barack for his flaws?  I'm not saying we shouldn't. 
[02:39:00]  Easy.  And if we don't, that makes us racist.  I'm not saying that...  Fuck you, easy.  Wake up.  I'm not saying that...  I'm not saying that we shouldn't.  I'm just saying it's all bullshit.  This guy is with his preacher every day.  You can say that about anything.  Even if he sees him on a goddamn Sunday for an hour, now he's tied to this man for the  rest of his life.  Oh, Sunday for an hour or for the last 20 years.  20 years.  Yeah.  Or Sunday for an hour.  Like he's never had...  He's a fucking family member.  And that doesn't make people racist if they don't vote for him.  Nick, you're going to tell me why I'm a racist. 
[02:39:30]  And it's all the white people that really don't want to vote for him.  Yeah, you're a fucking self-hating white man.  That's it.  Another white coward.  You're another...  I would vote for him.  If you're white and you don't vote for Obama, you're racist.  That's what it is.  That's it.  That's it.  Right.  That's like the other side where he's like, if you're going to vote for him, it's because  you're a self-hating white guy.  Rather than you don't want another stupid-ass Clinton.  And I just think McCain's going to be more of the same.  You know something?  If you're a Democrat that likes his values and what he wants, then fine.  Vote for the fucking guy.  I'm not saying because he's black.  And I wouldn't call anybody... 
[02:40:00]  That's what I don't like.  No, you're not listening to me.  I'm saying...  I'm not saying.  By him saying that you're not voting for him just because you don't want to vote for  a black guy is as ridiculous as saying you're voting for him because you're a self-hating  white person.  Those both statements are...  But there are groups that aren't voting for him because he's black.  And there are self-hating white people that are voting for him.  I mean, but it's not everybody.  No, not everybody.  No.  I'm not saying that.  But he's generalizing, too.  Yeah.  Hey, let's say hi to Sean in Georgia.  Sean, what's up?  A little nod. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey, Sean.  First off, I think what Jeremiah Wright said was ridiculous anyway to begin with.  Well, yeah.  What you're not talking about is Hagee, I believe while McCain was standing on stage,  was making comments that he believes a nuclear war with Iran is necessary.  The United States was founded to take out Iran and to take out all the Muslims and to  get rid of the Muslim religion.  And Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell's support considered a big thing with all the anti-Semitic  remarks they've made. 
[02:41:00]  And all the tapes they have of them making comments?  See, the Jew.  They're not.  You see, you're not understanding.  They aren't.  They could support McCain all they want.  Fucking Farrakhan is supporting Obama.  But it's not like anyone's making that thing and saying, oh, you shouldn't vote for him  because Farrakhan's supporting him.  It's not like this reverend has been his fucking advisor, his spiritual advisor.  He's been with him for 20 years of his fucking life. 
[02:41:30]  I mean, it's true.  You can't keep denying it.  You don't think he has an influence on him in any way or form?  How many times you hung out with Obama?  You don't know the fucking guy.  So you don't think he has an influence on him?  Listen, anytime they get one little piece of horse shit, they're just going to keep spinning  it and spinning it and spinning it and spinning it and spinning it and spinning it.  Why wasn't it his first statement on the situation as strongly worded as his second one?  Because he noticed, oh, my poles are fucking slipping.  I got to really condemn him.  Yes, and the first time he went with the honesty, which is basically... 
[02:42:00]  Honesty?  Yeah, this guy's my buddy.  I've known him for 20 fucking years.  And I won't disown him.  And I'm not going to disown him even though he's a fucking racist asshole.  I know, I liked it.  And now he's disowning him.  So what does that say?  That's politics.  It's phony.  Yeah, it is politics.  Dude, look, if you're going to talk about character, dude, you got a guy, they went  into this fucking war.  You got a guy who was a draft dodger, another guy who got 12 deferments.  All these guys are full of shit.  Yeah, I don't think he'd win again.  These guys are all full of shit.  You're the one who wants to make a clean break from that, don't you?  So why do you want more of the same?  No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying. 
[02:42:30]  First of all, ask me what I want.  Don't tell me, you're telling me...  I'm not...  Billy, you want more of the same.  You're doing that shit.  Why can't we examine his character flaws?  Because he's black?  We shouldn't?  No, that's not what I'm saying.  If you would listen, dude, you're not listening.  I am listening, Bill.  Go ahead.  I'm saying that you look at McCain, you can find stuff about him, you can find friends  with him, and they'll find fucked up stuff about him.  I don't listen to that either, is what I'm saying.  Not spiritual mentors, two different things.  Plus McCain.  Oh my God, spiritual motive. 
[02:43:00]  We live in the fucking 1800s.  He says this.  The black is the one who says it.  Like there's this little wooden church out on the fucking bar.  You don't want to know how close he was to it.  That had an influence over this guy's life.  I know.  He had an influence on his life.  Yeah, bring that up.  He influenced his life and his spirituality.  And his morals, his morality were influenced by this man.  You don't know him.  He said it before.  You don't know him.  I don't know him.  We got more dirt on him than you, though. 
[02:43:30]  First of all, all these guys, they're owned by the same fucking...  Oh, here we go.  The same corporations.  They put the money behind the same thing.  You think there are actually any one of them?  Here we go.  Here we go.  The man!  Yeah.  How do they run for office?  From the money you give them?  No.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not going man.  It's basic.  He called me out on the man thing.  It's basic.  It's all bullshit.  First of all, getting mad at a politician is like getting mad at Jennifer Aniston because  it's a bad episode of Friends.  They don't write it.  There was never a bad episode of Friends.  They just put him out there. 
[02:44:00]  Now I got to call you out.  That show was racist.  There was no black people on.  Seriously.  Sure it was.  Saisha Tyler.  I like you're right.  She's kind of like...  Oh my God.  I don't know what...  But I honestly...  Even though he is a spiritual...  He was a spiritual advisor.  And I think Obama is more fucking revolutionary than he admits.  But I don't care.  I still want him.  I really do.  I don't give a fuck.  You don't care?  No.  I don't care.  At this point I don't either.  I really don't.  But I do think he's a little more revolutionary than he's letting on.  It's hard to overlook.  It's a double standard.  I wouldn't give a shit.  It's a double standard.  You know who I like that everybody laughed at? 
[02:44:30]  Who was the guy that ran...  David Dukas.  I don't think it's double standard.  Alan Keyes.  Oh Alan Keyes.  Sure.  Who I loved.  Because the guy actually believes what he says.  And I know you'd never believe that I'd vote for him.  I'd vote for that guy in a second.  Only because he believes what he believes.  On the phone you couldn't tell he's black though.  That's why I don't like Alan Keyes.  On the phone you...  But I really like Keyes.  Yeah but I understand why you keep saying it's a double standard.  When this guy has this thing and it won't go away and they are screwing him to the wall.  This is what happens.  This is screwing him to the wall. 
[02:45:00]  The kid gloves.  Where's the outrage that are calling for him to withdraw from the race and let Hillary do it.  Because he's an advisor.  His spiritual advisor is a racist.  Where's the outcry?  They treat him with kid gloves.  They let him do whatever the fuck he wants.  It is a double standard.  It's a double standard.  Completely.  It comes to rice bill.  He's a double standard.  If it was McCain and had the same relationship with a pastor...  And he had a pastor who was crashing white people.  And the pastor started using the N-word in his... 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  And the pastor starts using the N-word in his sermons and stuff.  And they got fucking statements from him that he was saying all kinds of shit about black people.  He'd be thrown out of the fucking race.  The Republican Party would say, get the fuck out.  He'd have to go.  Because there'd be outrage.  But there's no fucking outrage.  He's treated with kid gloves.  He might win it, for Christ's sake.  Of course.  He's still in it.  He's insulated.  Let's jump in here.  Dave, Massachusetts.  What's up?  I love Nick DiPaolo.  I would vote for him for president because he tells it like it is. 
[02:46:00]  And I can't vote for a black man who keeps asking me for change.  Thanks.  I know.  You know who that was, by the way?  That was Blind Dave.  Why didn't he acknowledge that was Blind Dave?  He's very famous.  Our governor?  That's the...  He's blind.  Is his name Patterson's first name, Dave?  It is.  Dude, that's Blind Dave who did blind boxing and almost died for the show.  Oh.  Broken ribs.  Injured spleen.  Did he get blinded in the ring, too? 
[02:46:30]  No.  Oh, no.  And then he's also the guy that went and got his...  Sounds like a Ron Howard movie.  ...Massachusetts driving license, even though he's blind.  That guy.  Oh.  Here we go.  Fruit Monkey Joe.  Fruit Monkey Joe.  Fruit Monkey Joe.  He says, huge double standard.  Remember Trent Lott?  Basically got booted for saying if Strom Thurmond was president of the U.S., the country would  be better off.  And got booted.  And Trent Lott was eight when Strom Thurmond was in his 40s.  Wait, wait, wait.  Did the politician actually say it, or a friend of his said it? 
[02:47:00]  That's a good point, too.  Both good points.  It's a different thing.  Politician said it.  I'm asking if Obama was speaking at his church, trashing white people...  Hey, I don't know what goes on in there.  Then people...  I don't know what he said.  But he's right, though.  Obama didn't say it.  You know, just the fact that you're sitting here...  Oh, what the fuck?  There's some babies over here.  You just missed it.  What the fuck is going on?  Babies drop 50 feet for good luck in India.  Watch this video.  Look at this.  That's what the fuck is that, dude?  That's all customer service training. 
[02:47:30]  What the hell?  I don't know where his thumb was.  What the fuck?  What can't we pick up the baby?  I saw, Nick.  What the fuck is that?  They dropped it 50 feet.  How is that fucking good?  And they were cheering him on.  No helmet or nothing.  Over here our kids are wrapped up in...  Our baby throwing contest is going to be a big hit, Antsy.  I'm telling you.  I know.  We could do this.  It's topical.  What is, you know...  What's the matter?  You're saying I sit here like...  No, no.  Do you think I can keep my thought when I just saw a bunch of people dropping fucking...  Babies from 50 feet. 
[02:48:00]  On the top of a true value hardware store?  Ah, shit.  I thought they were looting a Toys R Us.  You know what I mean?  Don't you have cable?  Don't you realize that you're not supposed to do that?  You fucking moron.  What do you mean?  All cultures are equal.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's right.  You gotta respect their culture.  There's nothing wrong with that.  We just don't understand it.  We need to be more inclusive.  Yeah, man.  Oh, yeah, because I don't completely, 100% trash everybody from another culture. 
[02:48:30]  That means I can't look at babies being thrown off of a fucking hardware store.  I just wish there wasn't anybody there to catch them.  I'd like to see what kind of fucking slippery road conditions that makes.  Pete in New York City.  Pete, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Anthony.  Good to hear from you.  Listen, you guys got a great show.  But, you know, Jimmy, you're way off on your Obama candidate.  Why?  Listen, you're one of the hardest working guys that's on the radio.  You do your radio show five days a week.  You're going off on weekends, doing your shows.  You're constantly working. 
[02:49:00]  These guys get elected.  You're going to be giving up your money to these guys to pay for all their programs.  I'll agree with that.  I'm not even going to argue tax-inspect Democrats.  I typically would never endorse Democrats because of the tax reasons and crime.  But McCain, I actually like as a man more than any of them.  I respect him as a guy more than any of them.  I just, I really want the war to be over.  I really would like the war to be over.  I think he's a little too old.  And I just want something different.  That's it.  And I'm willing to pay a little bit more.  I look, I fucking loathe.  You're going to pay a little bit more.  You're going to pay a little bit more.  I'm telling you, I understand. 
[02:49:30]  You're going to pay so much more.  Dude, I get it.  I get it.  Believe me.  I'm not for paying more taxes.  I just want to see something different.  I hate Hillary.  If it wasn't McCain, I might go Republican.  But McCain's just old.  And I'm fucking sick of it.  How about something really different?  I don't get that point either, man.  You've got to get away from the race.  And you've got to get away from the personalities.  And you've got to go look at their economic plans.  They're both socialists.  I get it.  I'm telling you.  Exactly.  I hear what you're saying.  Socialists.  I hear what you're saying.  As opposed to what they're doing now, spending a billion dollars a day, getting the money  from China.  When the fuck are we going to pay that back? 
[02:50:00]  I don't.  Fuck them.  We're not going to pay it back.  Fuck them.  It is despicable.  When they call in their tab, nuke them.  That's what I'm saying.  Fuck them.  That's right.  Just send them anything that makes your cock bigger.  They'll be so distracted for the next 25 years.  They'll all be dead on lead poisoning in a week anyway.  That's what you're out is.  That is what you're out.  Dude, you know what we should do?  We should just fucking nuke them, man.  Fucking parking lot.  Turn it into a parking lot.  I can't believe you did that corporations, man.  And you did that we should just fucking nuke them.  That's a fucking joke. 
[02:50:30]  You know what?  You know what?  Okay, I'll go with that.  When you're sitting there wearing like Kevlar.  Hey, I know the real world, my friend.  I know what the real world is like.  I don't live in some fucking dreamy cloud city like Bill Burr.  Why is David Bowie on television?  Oh, yeah, man.  You just tell it like it is, and I can't handle the truth.  Jimmy, if you had everyone's attention, that would have been a great line.  It's an ugly place, and you're making it uglier.  I just want to acknowledge that.  Thank you, sir.  Jimmy's looking at a picture of Hillary on TV.  She looks like David Bowie from the back.  She can't mark a coffee machine.  Look at her.  Look at her.  What is this button do? 
[02:51:00]  Representing the regular people.  She's going to carry the fucking football.  She's always been a Yankee fan.  She's going to be the one with the fucking king and the button.  But then said she was also a Cubs fan, and then she went.  She's such a fave.  Mark in South Carolina has something.  Mark, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  I've actually been married to a black woman for the last 20 years.  Boo!  Boo!  I'm kidding.  Love is love.  Boo!  Where are the white women at?  Where are the white women at?  Where are the white women at? 
[02:51:30]  Where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Is that a black church?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  All right, dude, we're kidding.  We're joking with you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're joking.  So what was your point?  What was your point, Mark?  Start over.  In fact, she has changed her mind. 
[02:52:00]  Wait, what?  Start over.  Yeah, you've got to start over.  She changed her mind about Obama.  Start over.  She was voting.  No, no, no.  His wife.  His black wife.  No, no.  Okay.  My black wife was voting for Obama.  Boo!  Yuck.  Get off the phone.  Don't call us again.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  How did he walk into that again?  Hey, Nick's helping him out.  His African-American wife, Jim.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I'm sorry I did that. 
[02:52:30]  I'm sorry I did that.  So has she changed her opinion, dude?  Yes, she has.  Who?  All right, good.  She has because she said she believes racism is racism.  Is this your sister?  Your sister is changing her opinion.  Who cares?  Who is?  She and her family all are voting for McCain now.  Who is she?  I don't understand this.  My wife.  What color is she?  What color is she?  Uh, she's darker than I am.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious. 
[02:53:00]  I'm big, big black.  You guys rock.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11 on.  So many clips I just can't play right here.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yes, sir.  Whatever you wanted to say, I'm glad to say this.  Oh, God.  Boy, this sure gets people impassioned.  Really brings out.  I'm not fresh as impassioned.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, you're still there.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  I'm still here.  Sorry, guys.  South Carolina, huh? 
[02:53:30]  You must make it quite a pair walking hand in hand down the street.  Wow.  You must really love her.  Exactly.  Wow.  They run through the store and then run back out.  They bolt.  Honey, get the car.  Yeah.  Let's run the dog.  Yeah.  Of all the places for her to fall in love, you know, in college in South Carolina, it  was not safe.  Wow.  Well, look, you liked it enough to.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What'd she do for you?  You the man.  Jimmy is the man, and I love you guys. 
[02:54:00]  And, hey, just keep the discussion.  All right.  My family.  Wow.  That guy just, he went for the three for.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah.  Trispector.  Let's go around the table here.  Around the horn.  Around the horn.  Egg white omelet.  Bill Burr, helium.  Alien Thursday through Saturday.  Very nice.  Jimmy's going to Pittsburgh today.  Pittsburgh, the Byham Theater tomorrow night.  And, Nicky?  Take it, Master.  The brokerage in Belmore, Long Island tonight, and then Governor's in Levittown Friday and  Saturday.  Be there or be queer. 
[02:54:30]  When we get back, we got Ted Manchin talking about gun control.  Oh, that must be fun.  Gun control with Uncle Ted.  Ted always has the facts.  We love Uncle Ted on this show.  Uncle Ted is going to be good.  Just sit down and relax, Uncle Ted.  Oh, we get it, Ted.  You're informed.  We get it.  You did your homework, shithead.  Do we like him, though?  I love him.  I love him.  He just babbles over everybody.  Well, you know, Ted, don't school children.  Uncle Ted will tell you.  That's all.  All right.  We understand.  You're casual.  You're in charge.  We were trying to have a discussion with the guy.  We couldn't get a word.  You're in charge.  He damaged my head. 
[02:55:00]  I like how he thinks he's still shocking.  Dude, you're 60.  You are the establishment.  Al, not so sharp.  Ah, that's good, Ted.  It kind of sounds like his name, but you twisted it.  Oh, that's you and a whole Curtis play well with his fucking 50s jargon.  Oh, he's terrific.  The mobsters with the lobsters.  What?  He actually says that?  Yes, he does.  Oh, he has all these stupid little, and I like the guy.  Can we get some, ladies and gentlemen, and all the shit that's he.  We can get, we got to get his shits on Curtis Sleeve by doing that kind of shit he says. 
[02:55:30]  I wish for once a fucking cab window didn't work.  Do you know, real quick, when I did Hannity and Combs, I was really better than you'd think  I was.  I did it with Curtis, and he told me that story after I asked him about getting shot by the  mob.  It was chilling.  Yeah, that's chilling.  Fucking cab picks him up.  He's got some balls.  There's no good about it.  Oh, he's a fucking ballsy dude.  But Uncle Ted, well, thank you.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  But he's got that, Mike.  We get it.  You kill it.  We eat it.  We know.  No one stops you, Uncle Ted.  Al Sharpie Shopton.  Oh, yeah.  Al not the Sharpton, and, you know, we're all liberals, Ted. 
[02:56:00]  Just you.  You're real.  All right.  He talks about gun control, Max.  Hey, working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things sonic bombast, Ted Nugent, and you're listening  to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  They're going to be considered hot.  Jesus.  Brilliant.  Bill Burr is brilliant.  We were just talking about all sorts of shit, unfortunately. 
[02:56:30]  We had to take a break.  We had to take leaks, get our food and all that on.  But the radio continued.  What's your theory about water again?  Oh, this is the toxic waste from whatever was before us that completely fucked up the  planet.  How long you been in L.A.?  Oh, dude, you think I thought this shit before that?  I know.  So then we're going to fuck this planet up, and then the next group of people will be  doing backstrokes and, like, nuclear waste with, like, tall heads.  In our shit.  Yeah.  We got to save the waste.  Yeah, look at what we're doing.  I mean, yeah, it's much better the first time I said it. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  It's all right.  It was a whole thing.  I was just trying to re-  No, we were also talking about global warming and how, you know, it was an ice, there was  an ice age.  Yeah.  And shit's just still melting.  That's pretty much what my theory is.  What would you rather go through?  Like, if you're going to slowly die, would you say heat, or would you rather go with the  cold?  Another ice age, or the molten lava?  Based on the Twilight Zone episode, I would think the cold would be a little better.  Remember where the woman had the dream?  It's not going to affect Anthony.  He's got his Kevlar fucking shirts and all kinds of shit. 
[02:57:30]  I will just go on a rampage.  I'll just go on a rampage.  You should see him in the winter.  I said the last time I was here, you dressed like you were in that movie, The Thing.  Yeah.  And a parka.  He has those little third grade coats with the fur around the hood.  A little snorkel gel.  Snorkel gel.  I need a parka.  Yeah, the snow fort.  Like a chili.  The Thing.  And it's becoming very interesting.  I get chili.  I'm loving the change that's going on with him.  There's no change.  Look at how you're dressed.  There's a lot in that mustache. 
[02:58:00]  There's a lot of shit going on.  I'm trying to bring in the new look of militia wear.  What's up?  Some kind of, you know, tactical wear.  You're bringing back the public enemy thing.  That's what you're doing.  Why can't you wear tactical wear as just casual clothing?  I think I could do that.  I think I could put this over.  You're setting the tone, man.  I like it.  People are going to be sold out.  They're going to be going, why the hell?  Well, you know, usually it's cops and military that buys here.  But now this place looks like the Gap.  Hey, do you actually go to a shooting range? 
[02:58:30]  Do you just have like an old car turned over in your backyard?  Yes.  Just shoot cans off the hood.  I go to a range.  Yes, I go to a shooting range.  Why don't we do Uncle Ted talking about gun control?  Uncle Ted.  Uncle Ted.  By the way, we lost another listener.  Joe in Jersey.  Congratulations.  You've made your show into one more radio show promoting right-wing extremism.  If you're worried about your ratings, which we're not, by the way, maybe you should consider  the fact that long-time fans like me turn you off when the racism starts.  Shut up! 
[02:59:00]  That's right, bub.  Long-term fans.  Then you shouldn't have fucking been a fan right from the beginning.  So let me get this straight.  This was the show that put them over?  Right, yeah.  How many years you've been on?  Exactly.  Yeah, this was the first time you showed a fucking extreme racist kind of-  Yeah, yeah, slave girl, you know.  Stay in New Jersey.  And that's some recent-  Stay in New Jersey and vote for another Corzine and McGravey, you fucking dill-to.  That's right.  Rage his taxes again.  I like gravy.  I like McGravey.  Yeah, you know, the best thing is you're pointing with the plastic fork.  That was my favorite part.  Yeah, taxing everything. 
[02:59:30]  Let me tell you something.  He doesn't want to commit enough to put the fork down and point the finger.  No, but it's great because it's something very dismissive.  If a guy can trash you while he continues eating.  Well, he just waves his fork at you like, fuck you.  You got your hat up your ass.  That's true.  As he's nibbling away.  Dan, I asked for fucking whole weight.  All right, here's Uncle Ted.  You can't stop a bad guy with a middle finger and a bag of quarters, Uncle Ted is going to  tell us here.  Of course.  I've gone through the procedures, the landmine field of bureaucracy. 
[03:00:00]  Of course you have, Uncle Ted.  The landmine field of bureaucracy.  I love how he just, you know, he just, he's so, he's almost like watching himself as  he thinks he's crafting these magnificent sentences.  Yes.  Because I stood in the precipice of this great country.  He's a word wizard.  He just like, wrong.  Yes, isn't he?  Word smith.  Word smith.  He's a word douche.  Exactly.  I've gone through the procedures, the landmine field of bureaucracy, unfortunately, to make  sure that I am a sworn law enforcement agent for 32 years now. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, Sheriff Ted.  Also a constable in Texas, and I conduct raids with the heroes of law enforcement all  across the country.  I'd laugh my ass off if Ted Nugent came in.  Exactly.  On a drug raid.  He's doing coke, listening to one of his CDs, and he comes in, it's like, what do you want?  He's got that raccoon tail hanging off the back of his pants.  Yeah, really in the middle of the raids.  Is he in the raid?  Like, is he in the back?  Is he in the front with the fucking, right behind the guy with the fucking ram through  the door?  Sure.  With his fucking compound bow?  No, he's a geek like us at a rock show. 
[03:01:00]  I can't believe we got backstage.  He's just sitting in the cop car.  You think you're going to shoot somebody?  Exactly.  Law enforcement.  With the heroes of law enforcement all across the country, I get to carry a gun nationwide  because of the House Resolution 218 that we passed.  Okay.  All right.  Hold the phone.  What happened?  I need that.  Need what?  What does Ted have?  I want what Ted has.  You didn't hear about the Resolution 218?  I want what Ted has.  Are you going to be a sheriff, Anthony? 
[03:01:30]  I need to be deputized.  Oh my God.  Ted can carry in all 50 states?  The fuck is that about?  Hey, people are checking out your new look, by the way, and they think you look like Janet  Jackson from...  What album was that?  Yeah, what was that?  Rhythm Nation.  Rhythm Nation.  Get me a picture of Janet Jackson.  Rhythm Nation.  Well, they won't Photoshop that on any message boards, I'm sure.  They got to get you with your hand to five, four, three, two, one.  Rhythm Nation.  How do we even know that? 
[03:02:00]  That's fucking funny, man.  Wait.  Yeah.  Fucking Rhythm Nation.  It's got the Rhythm Nation.  Look, I got the Rhythm Nation look.  He needs some...  I need a couple of medals.  Ah, back to...  You asshole.  Back to Uncle Ted.  We passed.  Finally, giving what is, to me, who would not want a cop to be armed every place?  They're trained to serve and protect.  You can't stop a bad guy with a middle finger and a bag of quarters.  I want warriors to have the tools necessary to stop evil, but that we had to get special 
[03:02:30]  legislation to authorize...  Look, I got...  Oh?  It's so bizarre.  Ted Kennedy thinks it's reasonable gun control to send in two...  Pause that, please.  His brothers both got shot, you stupid asshole.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  How about you cut Ted Kennedy some slack on his gun views?  Because he has more brain matter in jars than any other person in the country. 
[03:03:00]  Jesus Christ.  He has to buy no Christmas gifts anymore.  Thanks to guns.  Holy shit.  God almighty.  You might want to give him a break on this one.  I know.  You're all for guns because you like to hunt deer and put out your shitty cookbooks.  His brother's fucking head went up on the back of a Lincoln.  He's got to call 1-800-Flowers every three days.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, jeez.  Right.  What the fuck, Ted?  Got to with Jimmy on this one.  Exactly.  You don't go into a kitchen because you cook your own food. 
[03:03:30]  He doesn't because his brother took one in a fucking hotel kitchen in California.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Because he fucked with the Guineas.  It's horrible.  They're still trying to reconstruct the skulls of his brother.  That's right.  Jesus.  No, good example.  I got goosebumps.  It's so bizarre.  Ted Kennedy thinks it's reasonable gun control to send in two deputy cops to a shooting  at a pizza parlor in New York.  Mary Jo Kopechny's family is four guardrails on bridges. 
[03:04:00]  Right.  How outrageous is this?  Exactly.  He is a fucking...  And they're shocked at the Brady Bill.  Why would...  He talks like fucking...  He talks like Blair's cousin Jerry now thanks to a bullet.  Why would James Brady be against guns even though one wrecked his life and put it in  a chair?  He shits into a bag.  He should be happy that someone didn't attack him with a bag of quarters and a middle finger.  Shut the fuck up, Ted. 
[03:04:30]  Fucking Deputy Ted, shut up.  Is this more right-wing drivel?  Holy shit.  Fucking listeners.  Fucking playing sheriff.  Shut your mouth.  You know, he has little Ted Nugent spurs.  You know, he fucking jingles when he walks in that door.  Uncle Ted, coming to bust you.  That's right.  Uncle Ted, put your hands up.  This is one of the gods of law enforcement.  Fight me.  Shut up.  You and your fucking make-a-wish shooting animals.  Fucking asshole.  Oh, and I hate when he always has like a piece...  You don't like them?  I do, actually. 
[03:05:00]  When he has a piece of raw meat and he's like, mmm, look at that venison.  Yeah, jerky.  Like he's freaking everybody out.  Yeah, bad news for...  Fucking deer meat stinks.  I mean, it's shit.  It really doesn't taste good.  Yeah, there's a reason we're not all eating.  Yeah, there's a reason people aren't fucking getting out of their cars on the sawmill and  drag them to the...  Fucking pick it up.  In traffic and having their wife help me lift this.  This will feed us through June.  I love the localism of your joke.  The sawmill.  I can't forget we're on XM. 
[03:05:30]  No, it's good.  It goes all the way to fucking New Jersey.  It is funny.  You're like, you're going to pull someone over in Brewster.  Let's get back home to Uncle Ted.  Two deputy cops to a shooting at a pizza parlor in New York.  They're both dead.  Because you don't send unarmed cops into dangerous conditions unless you're absolutely mentally  deranged.  Ted Kennedy and Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton.  You are evil people.  You are on the side of evil.  Because you're guaranteeing that good guys will die at the hands of evil because you 
[03:06:00]  won't let us carry guns.  What he's talking about is two fucking...  Those two special...  Utility cops.  They were auxiliary cops.  Not auxiliary cops.  They don't have guns, but no one told them to chase a guy without guns down the street  because that's why...  I mean, it's terrible that they got shot.  Absolutely.  But you don't have guns.  He does.  Fucking wait it out.  Their job is to make a phone call.  Make the phone call to the cops.  Don't follow the guy with the gun.  They actually were...  They weren't pursuing him.  Are you disagreeing with Uncle Ted?  They were following him.  They weren't pursuing the guy.  They were following him on the other side of the street from a distance. 
[03:06:30]  The guy...  He shot a bartender.  And radioing in to get the real cops there.  The guy turns around, saw that they were following him, ran across the street, and shot the two guys.  He didn't want to be followed.  He had just had some spaghetti and shot a bartender.  Who wants to be followed after a murder?  It's like, hey guys, I'm going to make a left on what's forth.  I think they were trying to be a little sneaky about it and not to...  Can you imagine that?  Oh my God.  That guy starts running at you.  They're like, oh...  They did.  They tried to take cover and duck, and it's just awful. 
[03:07:00]  It's a fine line between a fucking utility cop and a fucking Eagle Scout, apparently.  What the...  How can you guys have a cop and not have a fucking gun?  I know.  Unless you live in London or something.  I agree with Uncle Ted on that one.  There should be no more half-a-cops then.  Arm everybody.  That's right.  Either a cop or an Eagle Scout.  Remember Archie Bunker's...  Sue everybody.  Sue everybody.  Remember Archie Bunker's stance on hijacking?  Yeah, give everybody a gun.  When he said, hand out guns at the beginning of the flight to everyone on there.  He goes, yeah, a guy would be crazy to pull a rod out during the flight knowing everyone's packing. 
[03:07:30]  And then as you enter the flight, they come off, you just pick them up.  Yeah.  Like earphones.  Like headphones.  Like headsets.  So everyone gets a gun on the plane.  And he was doing one of those like commentary things.  So he was all serious.  On the local news.  On the local news.  And he used to have the...  Classic.  That was a great, great old family.  They were watching it down at Kelsey's.  Yeah, it's down at Kelsey's.  And then they get robbed at the end.  Yeah.  That was the irony of the whole team.  There was some line he did once.  I forget what Mike Stivick was talking about.  A guy with a...  A guy with something. 
[03:08:00]  A guy with glasses.  He goes, a guy with glasses.  A four eyes.  A guy who's a queer.  He's one of the greatest...  A guy with glasses is a four eyes.  One of the fucking greatest lines ever written.  It was so logical.  My favorite one was that time when the black dude came over at their house.  And Archie and Meathead were both given their versions of what happened.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  Yes.  When the elevator.  When Meathead talks about it, he takes out this little like nail file to cut into an apple. 
[03:08:30]  When Archie tells it.  Switch blame.  That was a huge thing.  You know what it was, Billy?  And he had a big...  You know who it was?  The black guy that played all those parts?  Uh-uh.  Ron Glass from fucking Barney Miller.  Yeah.  Oh, is that right?  He came in and Meathead's version was he's like, hello, how are you today?  Everything's fine, you know?  Or it was...  No, he was a step and fetch it.  Right.  Step and fetch it.  How are you doing, Mr. Parker?  Yes, sir.  I helps you right out.  And with Archie, he's got the big afro and he's like, yeah, what you looking at?  Whitey.  And he had a big switchblade. 
[03:09:00]  He had a cut into that apple.  He goes to Archie, man, you gotta watch out when you're doing...  He's got the knife in his hand, the big afro.  You gotta watch out, man.  You touch one of them live wires and like...  He's a fried man, man.  You think he's fucking angry enough?  Yeah.  Ron Glass was so good in that thing.  That was a classic.  Classic.  Could never fucking get away with shit like that.  Oh, it was so fucking good, man.  That was funny, funny television.  Now you get, you know...  Bullshit.  You got terrific TV now, you know.  You got Big Brother. 
[03:09:30]  Dancing with the Stars.  I've never seen like an episode of that.  American Idol.  I met the fucking guy who...  I actually got into...  My girl kept watching and I started watching.  They had...  Some kid from New Jersey won.  He had...  You know, someone just has...  Has Coke face.  You know, like...  Yeah, everybody in New Jersey...  They have like that...  The eyes are all fucking wide.  The only time he looked normal was when he finally won the thing.  Like the whole series, he looked like he just won half a million dollars.  And they would just be like talking...  I'm saying, we gotta get this guy in the house.  And he fucking...  Look at his teeth.  I mean, it sucks because it's radio. 
[03:10:00]  I can't fucking do it, but...  Yeah.  Let's do more Uncle Ted then.  Well, one more time.  I apologize.  They are indecent.  The other side.  The gun grabbers are indecent.  They are absolutely complicit in every violent crime that happens.  Because in every violent crime where there's an innocent victim, they are a descendant of Ted Kennedy's insanity.  And that is, you will be armed, you will be armed, you will be helpless, and you will die.  Ted Kennedy says so.  Not this guy.  He's obsessed with Ted Kennedy. 
[03:10:30]  I know.  Get a hold of yourself, Ted.  Just fucking relax.  Uncle Ted doesn't like Uncle Ted.  Yeah, we're sure.  There can only be one Uncle Ted.  One Uncle Ted, I'm the Uncle Ted.  Stop trying to galvanize everybody into action.  Is there anything worse than someone...  Overly enunciating ass.  We get it.  But you like him.  Of course I do.  I actually do.  I think he's a bright guy.  I just...  I think he's very well informed.  But he just...  He takes himself way too.  Well, yeah.  Well, because, you know, his star has faded.  But he won't acknowledge the fact that guns do...  Are something of a problem.  There's a line between where he wants to go and where Rosie O'Donnell wants to go. 
[03:11:00]  The guns...  Yeah, you should be able to own guns.  He thinks that anything, you know...  A machine gun...  A boy wants to shoot a bear...  All right, we know.  The outdoors.  They're always for the take in wild man.  Fuck you, you fucking hackies.  Fucking deer hats.  The people, like Barack Obama, wants to do away with semi-automatic weapons.  It's ridiculous.  Every fucking handgun that isn't a revolver is a semi-automatic gun. 
[03:11:30]  Those would be gone.  Bad guys are going to get them anyway, so...  Exactly.  That's the point.  Nobody can argue that.  No one fucking, no law-abiding citizen goes and gets a pistol license and goes through  all the channels to buy a gun and then commits crimes with it.  Except for the guys that snap.  Yeah, yeah.  Occasionally.  Very occasionally.  They can use anything.  That'll happen.  Knife.  Yeah.  I'll agree with that.  But it's like anything else.  The people that fucking can take a car and mow down a bunch of people if they're pissed off. 
[03:12:00]  No, they can't.  No.  You're right.  You punch on your license.  And your insurance will go off.  I certainly will.  But the thing is, and I'll say this to the listeners out there that are gun owners, if  you own a gun, I think you should sign up for the National Rifle Association.  I'm a card-carrying member.  And make a donation, which I have done.  What the hell happened to you?  Because it is the only lobby that is really strong that keeps your Second Amendment rights  from people like Ted Kennedy. 
[03:12:30]  And yeah, it's true.  Anybody who gives themselves a nickname, at that point, you just got to tap out.  Uncle Ted.  Uncle Ted.  Uncle Ted.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You're not a warrior of good fucking jackass.  A warrior of good.  You wrote a few semi-decent songs 30 years ago.  Now you're just fucking looking around for something else to do.  He's a one-hit wonder, by the way.  Oh, no.  Cat Scratch Fever.  Cat Scratch Fever.  Wasn't he a knight?  What else is there?  Oh, well, fucking Strangle Hole.  That isn't even a good song.  Strangle Hole is a fucking great song. 
[03:13:00]  None of them reached Cat Scratch Fever.  What was it?  He was in a band with that knight range.  Damn Yankees.  Damn Yankees.  He was in there.  They sang about gang-banging that girl, right?  I hope so.  Yeah.  Waited in a line just to be the next to be with you?  No, that's...  Oh, that was about going to the movies with Sandra Bullock.  That's a different band.  Yeah, he is a fucking one-hit wonder.  You're right.  He's fucking Kajagoogoo.  Fuck him.  Fuck.  Uncle Spandau Ballet.  I'll stand up. 
[03:13:30]  This much is true.  All right.  Enough about guns.  All they want to talk about today is Obama and guns.  That's all we got on the phone line today.  What's a good starter gun, Anthony?  A starter gun.  A starter gun.  A starter pistol?  No, you shouldn't get like a starter gun.  If you want...  What do you want it for?  Like home defense?  Something like that?  I just want to wave it at people.  You want to brandish it?  Yeah.  Then you don't want something faggy looking and little.  Something light.  I want something silver.  I recommend...  Oh, you want something silver?  Silver or one of those Clint Eastwoods, that midnight blue... 
[03:14:00]  I recommend a SIG 40 caliber, or a 45 caliber.  Start off with a staple gun.  Yeah, start with a staple gun.  They look like guns.  And then work your way up.  Then go to the nail gun.  The nail gun is better.  Just the other day, I got the official James Bond gun, the Walther PPK.  Jesus Christ.  Nice fucking gun.  How much dough does he spend?  A month on guns?  A lot.  He gets his guns from movies and video games.  Can't have it.  No.  Yeah.  And then I do get my ideas from video games.  I used to know a guy would do that.  There was some action movie in the 80s where they hit... 
[03:14:30]  No joke, man.  They had this shotgun with that Gatlin gun, the atomic gun kind of thing.  Like a street sweeper?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They called it the street sweeper.  He went out and got that.  I don't think they sell those anymore.  He used to be able to buy like...  Valentine.  Mac-10s and Tech-9s and fucking Uzis and shit.  You can't even...  Can't get that no more.  Can't get that shit no more.  This country coming too.  I know.  Nick in Illinois has a problem with the Second Amendment thing here.  Nick, what's up?  Oh, here we go.  Hey.  Oh, no, no.  Actually, first and foremost, I want to let you know...  Are you from Chicago, the place where you're not even allowed to own a fucking gun? 
[03:15:00]  No, I think that any responsible person should be allowed to have a gun.  But I wanted to remind you that the Second Amendment actually isn't your civilian personal  right to bear an arm.  Yes, it is.  It's actually the...  Militia.  Shut up.  No, it isn't.  That's an interpretation that fucking gun-controlled douchebags have made.  It says your fucking rights to bear arms should not be infringed upon.  It's not being infringed upon. 
[03:15:30]  It's written in capitals and they use the F word.  Fucking, uh...  Give me the militia.  Yeah, but what did they know back then?  Exactly.  That is true.  Stupid wooden teeth and wigs.  Stupid forefathers.  Don't act like they're out militias today.  They're called the Crips and the Wigs.  Just don't.  All the gun-controlled assholes tried that fucking militia thing.  Like, oh, what they meant was the army.  The citizens aren't supposed to have guns?  Fuck you.  Hey, you know, it's just the other side of the argument, man.  I don't know why you have to get so upset.  That's an asshole.  Well, it's all up for interpretation.  Like, a lot of people say one thing, the other guy says the other thing. 
[03:16:00]  That is some of the most...  The truth is not up for interpretation.  That is some of the most fucking obvious shit.  The truth is not up for interpretation.  When they wrote that, they said, we gotta word this in a way that is fucking so easily  interpreted that it can't be bastardized through the years.  And you know what they did?  Bastardized plain fucking English.  Well, because weapons change, they probably didn't see...  What you're...  What?  They probably didn't...  When they wrote that, they probably didn't intend it to be things that were good, like  machine guns.  It probably wasn't intended to go as far as it went. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, that's back when you had to, you know, pack that...  A musket.  There was at least something reasonable.  That one little metal ball you had to worry about.  There was a point there.  Yeah, but you didn't have...  You know who to worry about.  There is.  You can't own a machine gun.  You can't own a fucking machine gun.  But gun control people aren't for just stopping at one point where they go, all right, look,  we got the law done, and you're not allowed to have a machine gun.  Let's all bust up the club and go home.  They fucking keep going and going and take away everything so that no one is allowed  to be an armed citizen.  Armed citizenry. 
[03:17:00]  So we made this country the country.  No.  That was raping and killing the Indians.  Oh!  Speaking of...  Baby drop footage.  Baby drop footage.  Whoa!  Nice!  What the fuck is wrong with this?  Baby drop footage.  Yeah!  Baby drop footage.  Come on.  But you can't see it because it leaves the...  Whoa!  Don't shake the baby, but drop him from 50 feet.  What the fuck is going on?  And why do they have to make the babies nude on top of it?  Here we go. 
[03:17:30]  Whoa!  Yeah.  That kid's going to be answering my tech support call fucking 12 years from now.  I bet you're doing it.  Hello, my name is Phil.  No, it's not.  You're lying.  You're retarded, kids.  They try to drop the dumbness out of you.  That could be the greatest video in years.  What the fuck is that about?  Insanity.  Are the boys trying to figure out what that's about?  Do we have the story behind that?  Just good luck and that's it?  Sure.  It's got to be more than that.  Bouncing baby boy or something?  Yeah.  If it falls off and dies, good luck for the dad. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, exactly.  What if it lands wrong?  Uh, I'm about to take the most important phone call for Anthony in a long time.  We got Daryl from Louisiana.  Daryl?  Uh, yeah.  And I saw on ONA radio that you're a fan of 511 Tax Club.  I love it.  Yes?  I work for 511.  I would be glad to hook you up with some gear so you can pack heat and style.  We've got some covert shit.  Nobody would see you had it on you, so if they came up, fuck with you, you could just  blast them.  Billy, sir, I love it. 
[03:18:30]  If you would please hold on so that I may get your information, your email address, I  will personally email you.  Fucking nuts, man.  I love it.  Uh, I love your tactical wear.  Anthony's dressed like he just shot Pablo Francisco.  I love the boots, dude.  The boots are amazing.  Love them 511 boots.  You're looking more and more like a video game.  No, Escobar.  Escobar.  That's right.  He shot a comedian?  Yeah.  Escobar. 
[03:19:00]  He shot a headliner.  As I said it out loud, I'm like, wait, is that a comedian or is that a drunk cartel?  Escobar.  Do you ever read that book?  I was with you, Billy.  I like how it's still got a laugh.  We knew what you meant.  Killing Pablo?  Yeah, that's great.  Fucking unbelievable.  Yeah, that was someone on a cell phone.  Oh, that guy?  Is Daryl still there?  That guy he caught at his party who was stealing from him?  They get info right now.  Oh, get his info.  Drowned him in a thank you, sir.  In front of the whole party.  Most important.  You gotta read this book of-  Killing Pablo.  Killing Pablo?  Best fucking thing I ever read in my life.  He had a, Pablo Escobar evidently had like a, uh, he had a party one time and one 
[03:19:30]  of the, one of the servants got caught stealing.  Oh, shit.  And he did something like, he tied his arms and legs together.  To a lawn chair.  Yeah, and they just threw him in the pool and everybody sat there horrified at the  party like, hey, good one, Pablo.  Listen, we gotta go.  Oh, look at the time.  We have a baby shower to get to, so we're gonna leave.  He just got here.  What?  Fuck, really?  Oh, my God.  I'm gonna pick up that book.  The swim trunks are, it's tremendous.  It is a tremendous book.  I do want to get back to Anthony.  I want to ask him what video game character he's going for with this look. 
[03:20:00]  Uh, this actually is a, uh.  A little GTA?  No, not GTA.  No, Call of Duty 4.  Call of Duty, sure.  A little Call of Duty 4.  Yes, uh, Tham?  With the touch of McLean Stevenson.  Yeah, you look like a.  That's it right there.  His Escalade spun into the sea of Japan.  There were no survivors.  You got Call of Duty, you got Janet Jackson and McLean Stevenson in Anthony's fashion.  It's a hell of a mix.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, uh, Travis, uh.  Travis's wife came by with that stupid dog. 
[03:20:30]  It had a fucking rod.  Yeah.  The dog likes the show.  Yeah.  The French Bulldog.  Travis brings it in to show it off to everybody and the damn thing had a heart on and I'm suggesting  that Pat Duffy blow your dog.  I'm trying to eat it.  I think that's a terrible idea.  That dog is awesome.  Come here.  Let me see what I think.  Hey, Lisa.  Oh, hi, babe.  Would you allow Pat Duffy to blow your dog?  No.  Jesus Christ.  Why?  I can't even take that.  Yeah, right?  I might have to leave the show.  The tongue scraping was enough.  Hi, Lisa.  Hi.  Are you a Canadians fan? 
[03:21:00]  Yes, I am.  Congratulations.  You beat up Bruins.  Oh, Canada.  I definitely will not allow.  Look how Travis holds the dog touching all his dirty parts.  What's the sound it's making?  He's breathing.  Shit.  It sounds like my grandfather before he died.  Sounds like Kenny on a plane.  Can Pat Duffy jerk off your dog just a little?  That's a bad idea.  Oh, for the love of Christ.  Sounds like the listeners during Kenny's bit.  Leeky-leek.  Big geek. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, boop.  The dog would like it.  He's sleeping with his eyes open.  What else does he do?  That's a hell of a noise.  What does it do?  That's good.  They should just breed him like that until their nose completely shuts off.  Yeah.  The fuck does it do that for?  Just so we have a cute dog.  That can't be good.  Right.  That can't be good.  My dog will breed a better dog.  One that can barely breathe.  How do you sleep with that fucking thing making that noise in bed?  It's kind of nice.  Well, they don't have a mic up to his face for one thing.  And it's whining.  What does the dog do?  Does it do anything?  Yeah.  What does it do? 
[03:22:00]  What do you mean?  Is it fun?  It eats and it shits and it snores.  What more than one?  Like a husband.  Why do you hold it like that where your hand is all over its dirty parts?  His feet?  No, you're close to his dick.  No, like your wrist is on its asshole or something.  Ah, what are you going to do?  I hate that.  You never hear that to often.  Put your wrist on my asshole and it turns me on.  Now put your elbow on my tit.  How do you have sleep apnea when you're a witch?  Yeah, hold on like that.  Yeah, it needs a little oxygen mask.  Sounds like my friend Mike Bochetti. 
[03:22:30]  Get him one of those Breathe Rites.  Get a Breathe Rite strip for a dog.  Dude, that's a good looking dog, don't you?  Is it?  What's with the fucking ears?  Back leg.  That's great.  Looks like a wingless giant bat.  Look at Randy Jackson's eyes.  From American eyes.  Really does.  Big bloodshot beauty product.  All right, look, it's not sexual.  This is a great idea.  I want to thank Squarehead.  It's a great idea.  Can we let Pat Duffy give him a rim job? 
[03:23:00]  It's not sexual, really.  He's just playing his asshole with his tongue.  That's a good point.  It's hygiene.  Bill?  I just want to pet the dog before I can't even look at it after this stunt.  All right.  I'm actually a dog lover.  Before he gets sexually abused.  What's up, buddy?  Come here.  Sam, you don't have to have the camera in the studio.  We're not doing anything.  How about we tongue scrape the dog?  I mean, I'm trying here, people.  Help me out.  Is it pissing?  Nothing?  No.  You know, I didn't know it.  Hey, Sidney Poitier is going to be on CNN, Ant.  Our favorite.  Oh, fine. 
[03:23:30]  After Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier.  I'm Barack Obama and race.  We asked yesterday where was Sidney Poitier.  I said, where was Sidney Poitier and somebody hurt.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  Dude, we were totally random.  We were making fun.  We just pulled any random black actor out of our ass.  When all this Obama controversy started out yesterday, we were like, where is Sidney  Poitier on this?  Well, he's going to be on Larry King tonight.  Get that fucking audio.  He's actually a fan of the show.  Who?  Sidney. 
[03:24:00]  Really?  No.  No.  Not at all.  All right.  I want to thank Lisa for completely, you know, getting the show to come to a complete  hole.  Oh, wow.  She brought the dog in a nice show.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  I think this segment was fantastic.  Yeah.  Weird.  Dexter.  Take little Dexter.  And there he goes.  Yeah, now that's not considered any sort of bestiality if you give it a handjob.  You can just say we're breeders.  We were a little confused.  Oh, like artificial insemination or something.  Trying to get a sample.  Yeah, we didn't know we had a female. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, we asked our friend to hold it in his mouth.  Sorry to interrupt, but we have to plug Dexter's Facebook.  Oh, yeah, Dexter's dog book.  Yeah, Dexter's dog book.  What do we get on Dexter's dog book?  I'm not entirely sure.  See, because I didn't make it.  Who did?  Dexter?  No.  My lovely wife.  We can plug his YouTube videos, which are a smash sensation.  They're not.  At this point, we know what your wife likes.  What does Travis like? 
[03:25:00]  I like Dexter.  I like video games.  I hear Eric laughing.  Was that E-Rock laughing?  Yeah.  Why is he laughing?  It's just not him.  Pretty much it.  Very good.  All right.  I guess that's it for Dexter.  Yeah, just YouTube Dexter Jack Bauer.  Oh, yeah.  Could have had that guy bear eat the fucking thing.  Huh?  Terrible idea.  All right.  Should we take another break, and then we'll head toward the line of the day and maybe some 
[03:25:30]  cleanup here?  Iraq's oil windfall.  Amount twice what expected.  Of course.  $4 a gallon.  Can we have some, please?  For a real cheap price?  Are you kidding me?  Those people who run Exxon Mobil, I wish that somebody would pick up a rifle and fucking  just go after them.  Well, it's more OPEC.  It's more the OPEC nations.  All of them are fucking scumbags.  They're pitching at the oil companies.  They're getting their last shots in.  They know eventually, oh, predators are coming.  They're like, we're going to fucking rape these people. 
[03:26:00]  But they've been doing it for years.  They're just fucking such scumbags.  They just must be laying naked in money, rolling around laughing.  They're just putting change in their armpits.  That reminds me.  That reminds me.  I'll be at the brokerage tonight.  Hey, should we ask the listeners if they have anything?  You guys got anything for the show today?  Any surprises?  Anything?  Nothing?  They're all looking behind them.  Their asses are all numb from the bleachers.  I know.  Those bleachers are awful.  My tailbone's bleeding.  Fucking awful.  They all leave with fucking hanging hemorrhoids. 
[03:26:30]  Hunger tail.  They all look like they suffered the same tragedy,  and they're going to come in and tell the story.  Yeah, this show.  All of our children died in a mining accident.  We're here to tell our stories.  That's really funny, man.  We're going to clean up next.  Welcome to the Obi-Anthony Show.  It's the first annual baby throwing contest.  Stay tuned for details.  It's the Obi-Anthony Show. 
[03:27:00]  I got some hockey brothers in studio today.  I love it.  Bill Burr and Nick DiPaolo in studio, and they love old-school hockey like I do.  Fuck this new game, man.  I go back to the 80s.  He saw the heyday.  You got to bring back the bench-clearing brawls, the goalie mask that only had the front protected.  You guys ever been to a game where there was a bench-clearer?  I was actually a Bruins-Montreal. 
[03:27:30]  The old garden when the benches faced each other.  Chris Nallin, that was that game when he had the butt of his stick to Rick Middleton.  I was at that game.  Until now, I forgot that the benches used to face each other, too,  so they would taunt each other across the ice.  They even took that out of the sport.  I forgot about that.  That's why they're side-by-side, because they can't really trash talk.  And this is what caused the bench-clearer was either Nallin got ejected out of the game 
[03:28:00]  or it was the end of the period, so they would bring him to the dressing room,  and he had to walk out right by the Bruins' bench, and he washed Ken Linsman's face.  Knuckles Nallin.  Little Ken Linsman.  The rat Linsman.  Yeah, he ends up running down after him, so then everybody had to come across as great.  Never mind.  They used to have a nice bench-clearer used to be like the Braveheart attack.  Yeah.  Where they have to slam in the middle and full speed ahead.  It was like a kickoff in the NFL.  Now they're like, yeah, it's all awkward to get out of there and hit each other. 
[03:28:30]  That was the saddest day when they took that out of hockey,  because you knew they would never, ever, ever, ever bring it back.  Well, the first thing they did, how do you do that?  Bring it back.  Ten-game suspension for the first guy over.  Right.  And now when they fight, they make sure they clear the area.  It's like, come on, man.  It's all for show now.  They gang up on each other.  I remember right after I started watching hockey, they had the third man in rule, finally.  Yeah.  But back in the day, if your buddy's getting his ass kicked, you just jumped in.  All in.  All in.  Which was kind of crazy when you think about it.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:29:00]  Like you're in a cafeteria.  All fucking in.  You know, he's just helping out a buddy.  I used to go in, every time the Flyers came to town in the 70s, this is mid-70s now,  but they were the Broad Street Bullies.  Yeah.  Fucking, you know, I mean, they set every penalty record, and the Bruins were just as goonish  that year.  They had Don Cherry behind the bench.  Don fucking Cherry.  They had Don Cherry.  They had a guy named John Wensink, who they brought up from junior hockey.  Yeah.  He bit a guy's ear off.  That's what he was known for.  He bit a guy's fucking ear off.  He lived in Danvers, my hometown.  I used to see him jogging. 
[03:29:30]  He was the one who challenged the whole bench.  Yeah, the Pittsburgh Penguins.  And nobody moved.  The famous scene where he's like, come on, come on, come on.  Yes, down the whole bench, and nobody moved.  He bit a guy's ear off.  He was a motherfucker.  But the toughest one was Stan Jonathan was the toughest guy in the history of hockey.  5'8", 205 pounds, Cherokee Indian.  Fought Bouchard.  Beat the fuck out of Bouchard, and the play bloodied him.  He used to pick people up by the front of their pants.  That was his move in a fight.  Only guy that gave him a fight ever was Tiger Wood. 
[03:30:00]  Tiger Williams.  Tiger Williams, excuse me.  I always say that.  Tiger Williams fucking is the closest to anybody.  Actually, Tiger Williams fought him and beat him, and then the next period, Jonathan came  back and blighted his fucking face.  Oh, yeah.  But that was the only guy that even gave him.  And Tiger Williams was a motherfucker.  He was the original UFC guy.  He took it right to the ground.  He was a badass.  It was all about payback, man.  You'd wait weeks for the two teams to match up again.  And you knew, as soon as they dropped the puck, it's like, all right, let's settle old  business before we play this new game. 
[03:30:30]  Do you remember when they were just, in the middle of the season, they'd have a random  home-and-home game?  So the first game, you always had to set the tone.  Right.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  They'd have like 12 guys in the penalty box.  Each box.  Yeah, just piled up on each other.  The goalies are out there one-on-one with each other.  It was great.  Fucking hell.  It's...  Yeah, the instigating rule got rid of everything.  They should do like, you know how the XFL was attempting to do something different?  Somebody should just come up with old-school hockey and say, look, we're just fucking doing  it.  We're taking the rules from the early 70s, and that's it. 
[03:31:00]  Because they always...  And get a little league together.  They always apologize for the fighting in the sport, rather than just being like, hey,  you ever think, man, why don't you just watch diving or some other fucking sport?  This isn't for you.  I could get you guys a spot on the hockey channel on XM.  They would love you.  They're always trying to get me and some of the guys on from the show, because they love  talking, obviously, about hockey, but they love old-school stuff.  They love it.  From 68.  I stopped following.  This is how I know the NHL's a problem, marketing their sport.  Because I'm a diehard for years hockey fan, and I've just lost interest. 
[03:31:30]  They've taken all the physicality out of it.  I understand they didn't want guys like Gretzky, Lemieux being dragged, you know, clutching  and all that shit, but it's too much now.  It's almost like basketballism.  Well, that happened when they took the fighting out, and then those guys could just do that.  The worst thing that happened, I swear to God, was Gretzky going to L.A., and it brought  all those teams down south.  It's just like, it's a Canadian game.  Just keep it up there.  Keep it in Buffalo.  Keep it in Michigan.  Yeah, that's it.  Boston and Philly.  That's it. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  You're not supposed to get it.  That's actually a good idea.  They should expand upwards.  Yeah, UConn Territory should be the next one to get the team.  The players' skills have outgrown the arena.  Simple as that.  I don't understand why they don't see that.  It's just a clusterfuck on the ice now.  Well, if you make the ranks bigger, it's going to get less physical.  You know what I mean?  And then it'll be total...  I could accept some skill, though, some skating, at least.  You know, like Olympic hockey.  I always bring that up. 
[03:32:30]  That was amazing.  Not to get nerdy here, but they should have never gotten rid of the red line.  What they should have done was just made the left wing lock and the trap.  Just make it an illegal defense, just like in basketball.  I kind of like they took that away.  At least you don't get those dumb icing calls anymore.  Well, because it opened it up more.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you could have gone right...  They still don't have those great two-on-ones, the three-on-twos that they're used to.  That's true.  There's definitely way more, but it took all of that Guy LaFleur kind of stuff out of the game.  And they also, like, when there's too many penalties, they cut it off at five-on-three.  Five-on-three.  Anthony's over here, like, he's pricing guns over here. 
[03:33:00]  I'm texting.  No, it's like, all right, I don't need to be here for this.  We'll talk about this idea.  I can get him back into the car.  Remember when Esposito pulled a gun and shot down the air in the air?  All right.  There you go.  He had a right to do that.  Old Uncle Anthony.  Old Uncle Anthony.  What was the team?  The Chicago Militia.  Yes.  Yeah.  Anyway.  But the Bruins, they're out, obviously.  What a disappointment.  Great game six, and then what? 
[03:33:30]  Five-zip, game seven?  Jesus.  It was great that they actually took them seven games, but they kicked our ass all year.  I'm pulling for the Flyers.  Me, too.  Flyers all the way?  Kind of, yeah.  No, no.  I don't give a shit about the Flyers.  I just hate the Canadians.  I just want them to lose.  I don't want the Canadians.  I'm indifferent with the Flyers.  I used to.  No, it doesn't even come past it now.  How can someone say hockey is for fags?  What's wrong with you?  That's somebody who's been brainwashed by the NBA.  Eric.  Eric, why are we not?  It's a self-hating hockey fan.  I'm a huge fan. 
[03:34:00]  I follow you all over the place.  But hockey's for fags.  Get back to the funny.  How is hockey for fags?  Get back to the funny.  Back to the funny.  Okay.  Where's the funny?  Hey, we just took a few.  Eric, come on.  Hey, man.  We just want a serious moment here.  I can say get.  People like hockey because of the physicality and because of the fighting and stuff.  Just watch a good UFC fight.  Forget about hockey.  Typical fucking network.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  You're right.  Same thing.  The same thing.  A guy in the missionary position in shorts for four hours on top of a guy. 
[03:34:30]  It's the same thing as watching.  In effect.  What is this?  Ew.  This guy used to play hockey.  No, no, no.  I just, you know, much appreciate you guys letting me in the studio here, but I just do not.  We didn't let you.  E-Rock just pulled in here.  Really?  All right.  So I was forced into the studio.  So I just don't understand.  His ping pong paddle head and neck is really bothering me.  You don't understand.  What do I understand about it?  What's that game of the rubber ball and the string?  Well, I'd rather play like four square because I just don't understand, like, is there one 
[03:35:00]  team is always better than another team because it seems just like a flip of the coin.  What do you mean?  In hockey?  A flip of the coin?  It's like, if the score's three to two, it's going to go either way any day of the way.  So what you'd rather watch, like, what?  A hoop game when it's fucking 102 to 60?  Yeah, but at least you know who's going to win for sure.  Oh, you want to know who's going to win before the game's over.  That's pretty fucking bright.  All right.  What are we talking about here?  That's why hockey's good.  The only thing I will sort of agree with you, there's a lot of luck involved with today's 
[03:35:30]  hockey.  A lot of luck?  Yeah, because they're all crowded the entire game and the puck happens to bounce the right  way.  Yeah.  I mean, why don't they fight more, at least?  That would be...  Well, we already said that.  That's a good point, actually.  Iraq, you will get punished for this.  What did you...  You made, like, some kind of decision to bring a guest into the studio?  Became a town media all of a sudden.  Yeah.  While you were discussing it, he was out there yelling, hockey sucks, hockey sucks.  Well, that's good.  How old are you?  You're like, what, 20?  24.  24.  What's your favorite sport?  Basketball, man. 
[03:36:00]  Of course.  You just made my fucking point.  Wow.  Really did.  Just made, because you're from a generation that has no fucking attention span.  You have to pay attention when you watch hockey.  No offense.  Is that your parents?  They're going to come in and beat them.  But, uh, fucking, you know, basketball, let's watch two teams trade baskets for three  hours, and I can come in in the last four minutes and see the fucking result of the game.  And when it's supposed to get exciting, at the end of the game, you know, when a team's  down by, like, four, they have to foul the other team.  That's real exciting.  It turns into a free throw contest. 
[03:36:30]  I remember, like, I watched fucking seriously.  That's why I can't stand the game.  It is fucking flawed.  College hoop is great, but pro basketball, dude, that final seven minutes, it took, I was  watching, like, it was 7, 7.20.  My girl's like, when's this game over?  I'm like, there's seven minutes left.  It wasn't over until five past eight.  Yeah, they get the foul, I mean, and they go to the free throw, and they foul, and they  down by nine, and they still call a timeout.  It's great when they're running the court, and they can hit a four-point play.  Yeah, I used to hate it.  And let's not use the term defense, okay? 
[03:37:00]  You can't use the term defense in a sport where there's over 200 points scored combined.  Stop this.  This is defense?  Oh, he drove around me.  The NBA lost me.  I'm with you guys.  I used to be a huge, huge NBA fan, man.  Huge.  Let me see.  A 7'2 guy from fucking Africa with arms.  He's 11 feet long, and he can dunk.  He can jump three feet high.  Your arms are six feet, so he's 14 feet over a rim.  Right.  Fucking skill like I've never seen, huh?  He can jump six inches off the floor and dunk the ball.  Exactly. 
[03:37:30]  Come on.  All right, whatever.  Fuck hockey, then.  Fuck hockey.  Fuck hockey.  Fuck basketball.  Thanks for taking the only thing I like.  Baseball.  Football.  Yeah.  He came into the cage.  Yeah.  Hockey, whatever.  Paddlehead.  League in Canada guarantees three fights per game for your money back?  Nah, come on.  That's what I'm talking about.  Is that my league?  Cooper, Ontario, what's up?  Hey, I just want to tell you guys, there's a major senior league in Quebec where if there's 
[03:38:00]  less than three fights in the game, you get your money back and your ticket.  How old are these guys?  They're actually...  Late 60s?  Most of them are retired junior hockey players.  Oh.  And it's their second job.  Oh, shit.  You know, those guys are angry.  Fuck, I need to watch that league.  Those are some bitter, angry motherfuckers.  That junior league up there.  Oof.  Sure.  It's probably all the brothers of, like, you know, old enforcers.  Yeah.  Like Ed Semenko.  I want to start a comedy club with... 
[03:38:30]  Moose Dupont.  ...with guys that almost made it.  I got Dave Schultz's card, you know.  Dave Schultz gave me his card.  The guy whose pilot actually went to air and made it for two episodes.  That's the only comedians I'm going to book.  Guys that were in L.A., they were this close, but it just didn't happen.  When I was at Halium...  And the trip is over.  I got to book these guys.  When I was at Halium, not the last time, time before, some guy handed me...  He worked for Dave Schultz's company. 
[03:39:00]  Dave Schultz is like a fan of mine.  Saw me on the fucking...  It says the hammer on his card.  I read his book.  Oh, did he?  Get E-Rock back in here, because the Hockey Channel is getting Travis and Lisa on today.  Who gives a shit?  You should get Nick and Bill on.  They would love you guys, man.  Can we get these guys on the Hockey Channel?  Huh?  Yeah, we can get them on.  I'm 46.  I'm bringing up shit that they've never even heard.  No, but they would love to hear a different angle, old school shit.  Yeah, I'll give them a call now.  They'll love to have these guys on.  If you want to.  I mean, that'll be up to you, but we can at least... 
[03:39:30]  When is it?  Gauge their interest or whatever.  Their show's from 10 to 12.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck it.  I'll call in.  All right, cool.  Come on, whore.  Line of the Day is brought to you by AshleyMadison.com if you're looking for a little something  on the side.  Basically, there's a website where you can cheat.  We haven't seen you in a while, Bill.  This is our latest sponsor.  Cheat on what?  Your chick.  A cheating website.  You need a website for that?  Well, and you need the girls, too, so the girls are cheating on their husbands.  All you need is the fucking pills and a can of Sprite. 
[03:40:00]  Let's just acknowledge that would have made a runner-up line of the day right there.  All right.  AshleyMadison.com for all you cheaters out there.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm literally looking up.  I didn't realize you were going to be reading Line of the Day.  I thought you were going to be showing me the website.  Oh, we could.  It's just...  Oh, no, Chuck.  What?  Yeah, leave it where it is.  Why?  What happened?  Nothing.  Did you just negotiate something while we're talking hockey?  No.  What did you do? 
[03:40:30]  Buy some boots or some shit?  What did you just do?  Anthony just brought a crossbow.  Wow, I've never heard that laugh from him.  That is totally guilty.  Busted.  I didn't.  Barely any air coming out of him.  He just ordered hand grenades.  I can see him on the screen.  He's like, what, me?  Yeah, he either ordered hand grenades or he rubbed one out.  Something just...  Something happened over there.  He just negotiated something over there.  You look guilty as fucking hell.  Look at him.  He's doing red.  What?  I didn't negotiate anything. 
[03:41:00]  By the way, I didn't finish my bit.  That's hysterical.  The bitter comedy club would be hilarious because the material you would get from these fucking  guys.  That'd be a great tour.  I'm not bidding yet.  No.  I wasn't looking at you, Nick.  No, I know.  I'm just saying.  Give me another week.  I'll be fucking kidding.  Instead of the kings, the almost kings.  Yeah.  The almost sign.  Why don't I just drive this bit right into the fucking ground?  Like a Zamboni.  I tried to bring it back and everyone was too polite to say, you know what? 
[03:41:30]  Why don't we just fucking do line of the day?  Hey, the 11 o'clock hour is up for grabs if you guys want to do it.  Billy, you want to stay?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, hey, Rune.  What the fuck?  What are we going to talk about?  Clark Gillies for 58 minutes?  Clark Gillies.  I used to caddy for him.  I used to caddy for that motherfucker.  That's a great YouTube click.  Clark Gillies breaks so-and-so's face.  Just a little.  Oh, God.  Is that a home?  Okay.  Is that a cookout?  A family cookout?  Dude, he's a regular at my brother's restaurant.  Is that a YouTube?  Oh, yeah.  He used to always be a motherfucker.  He used to kill O'Reilly.  O'Reilly would try and hang in there. 
[03:42:00]  Give us a good hockey fight that we could watch as we do line of the day.  1970.  I Googled this when I had my own radio show back in the early 50s.  But we Googled Montreal Canadiens versus Bro.  And I said to my producer, I think it was like 1970, put Canadiens Bruins.  It was a bench.  It was when the fucking cops got involved in that shit.  It was a beauty.  All right.  Here's Clark Gillies.  See, this is.  This motherfucker.  This is all right.  But I used to have to caddy for him at the Huntington Crest Club.  This guy was.  Well, you might as well show the stand, Jonathan.  If you just want to send him a bloody mess.  Look at this.  Just watching videos.  I'll just. 
[03:42:30]  Fuck him.  Fuck the listeners.  Let's watch videos of hockey fights.  Listen to our reaction.  If you want the rest of my story, I'll be on 57th Street.  See, you don't see this anymore.  No, look at that.  You don't see that type of shit.  Just knocked out cold.  Yeah, it was the uppercut.  Oh, man.  He was a big tough guy.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Yeah, you motherfucker.  What a goon.  That lumberjack beard.  Yeah, he was a motherfucker.  What an animal, man.  What a fucking animal.  No, but he was a good player, too.  Yes, he was.  He was a complete player.  Is that guy fucking bleeding?  Oh, yeah.  They used to.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  They used to fuck each other.  He gets him with an overhand right, and then the guy ducks down like, okay, that hurt.  And then he just comes with the uppercut.  Here it is.  Watch.  Oh, Jesus.  And he's just finding some room.  Good night.  Here we go.  Bang, bang, bang.  Uppercut.  Oh, see?  Yeah, it was the uppercut.  What the fuck was he fighting, a girl?  That guy?  Which ranger was it?  How that's part of a sport, though, is amazing.  And it's kind of funny, isn't it?  It is funny.  It's part of the game.  But it was the one sport where you couldn't talk shit. 
[03:43:30]  You can talk shit in every other sport, and now all your friends come out and help you.  This one, they just drop their ass.  Look how he skates off, adjusting his sleeves on his jersey.  Like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You feel the balls.  Just bumped him up real bad.  He should have had a sickle.  As he was skating.  I get suspended, and I played a year at JVs for breaking my stick on a kid's head.  Really?  Yeah.  Nice.  Playing Saugus, Massachusetts at Lynn Arena.  And I could hardly skate.  I just went out to stay in shape for a fucking spring track.  Oh, are you going to read some? 
[03:44:00]  No, I'm listening to you.  But there was a big kid for Saugus.  Big motherfucker.  And he was flattening buddies of mine who play hockey.  And he was laying them out like, fuck.  I get on, like, they put me on near the end of the first period, my first shift.  I'm going into the corner for the puck.  I look behind me.  I can hear this kid breathing down me.  He put me halfway up the fucking glass.  I'm not exaggerating.  I was six feet off the ice.  Holy shit.  And I'm laying there crumpled, and I get up, and I'm chasing him.  You know, my chin's like a foot from the ice.  That's how I used to skate.  And I just came back in the head, and the sticks went, fucking, set me off. 
[03:44:30]  Get out.  It was great, though.  It was fucking, you know, they skate you off.  It had to be done, though.  It had to be done.  It had to be done.  Again, that was, you know, that was in the 80s.  I was, you know, imitating guys I saw in the early 70s.  So they're like, this kid's fucking nuts.  What's he doing?  Amazing.  But I'm skating off with no gloves.  You feel like a badass.  HockeyFights.com is a great website.  Yes, I've got to acknowledge that today.  And then someone is saying, and I've heard about this, and I haven't seen it yet, best  hockey fight ever is Patrick Ruaz's son fighting in the Convert Junior League. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, no.  Have you seen it yet, though?  Yes.  It's not that great?  No, the other guy refuses to fight.  He just pounds on.  You've got to go to the 70s, man.  Stan Jonathan versus Bouchard.  Yeah, Bouchard and Stan Jonathan versus Dan Bouchard.  If you just want to see a guy become a bloody mess, if you've ever seen a guy beat up, like  a midget, beat up somebody who's six foot six, that's what it looks like.  Oh, really?  But you know where all the blood came from in that fight?  A referee got kicked in that fight. 
[03:45:30]  You remember?  Uh-uh.  That's where all the...  I mean, Bouchard was bleeding, too, but a ref tried to break it up, you got a skate  in the face.  Oh, fuck.  It was gushing out.  Look, here you go.  Here we go.  Here you go.  Do you have Fred Cusick?  Watch this.  Bang, bang.  Look at...  Look at...  What a badass.  Holy shit.  Look at him.  These two are trading...  He was the baddest.  Oh, my God.  He was the bad motherfucker.  Did you see?  He went from right and he switched to his left.  He switched to his left.  A lot of guys couldn't do that.  Now, watch the blood all over the ice.  See it gushing?  Yeah.  Here we go.  See it?  See this ref is cut. 
[03:46:00]  It's coming from the ref.  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  It's coming from both of them.  It's coming from both of them.  But it's coming from the ref.  I've seen it a thousand times.  I've seen the ref...  Oh, fuck.  He's all fucked up, too.  But that's not from...  See, this was fighting.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Hey, let's not forget, we got a couple Bruins fans in the studio.  I was reminded of the Islanders-Bruins fight, 1980 playoffs.  Lasted about 10 fucking minutes.  Yeah, again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This other one with Gillies probably fucking destroyed somebody. 
[03:46:30]  Exactly.  Bruins had some groans that year, though.  Hey, if you guys stick around, Nick and Bill from XM NHL want you guys on today.  We could do like a simulcast.  If you guys...  If you could stay here...  Just gotta keep it clean.  Yeah, we'll stay here.  We'll stay here.  By the time we finish the show and do a break...  Yeah, what's that all about?  You guys got like 45 minutes.  You could skate through 45.  Yeah.  All right.  A little pun.  I like how he waited to ask us on air, so it would be part of the awkward time.  Yeah, you know what?  I kind of want to get the fuck out of here.  That's true. 
[03:47:00]  Dude, you could totally leave.  You know that.  You know that.  Line of the Day brought to you by ashtonmaston.com.  Let's get into this.  Runner-up Line of the Day.  I just want to say, when her stockies come off after a 19-hour day, it must smell like  the bank-robbing mask of a mackerel.  But how does the mackerel hold a gun?  Exactly.  How's he going to rob a bank of a mackerel?  You could just wait him out to tell you the truth.  Yeah, right?  He'd fucking die.  Yeah.  He needs water, I think.  He needs somebody to throw water on him, actually. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  I thought you guys talking was literally still part of that clip, and I'm like, why do they  keep all this extra stuff on him?  Why do they keep this extra bullshit?  I didn't, too.  Bullshit.  How tired are we?  Wow, this is quite a clip.  I know.  Let's hang around for 45 minutes and talk about hockey where you can't curse.  We got to hang around.  Remember the terrific elbow that Stan Jonathan hit?  I'll tell you, it's such a beautiful game.  It's the open ice.  The rushes.  The sound of the skates.  You really paint the picture.  It's beautiful.  How about when somebody rings one off the pipes?  I don't know.  You were negotiating something while we were doing our hockey thing. 
[03:48:00]  We want to know what you were negotiating.  Really?  Yeah.  There's something going on over there.  No, there's something.  Who on me?  I think it goes beyond clothing.  I think you're hooking up with somebody.  What?  Anthony's having his bay windows tinted at his house.  That's a crazy fuck.  I got to get home to painters.  Yeah, that's what's the painters at my house.  You got to start wearing those glasses John Goodman wore in the Big Lebowski.  The yellow tint.  You got to start wearing those.  The sniper glasses.  Sniper glasses.  Dude, go with the Paul Kersey mustache. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, there we go.  All right.  Let's get my look together.  Paul Kersey, is that his name?  We'll get back to abusing Anthony, but first, another runner-up line of the day.  Or the one thing you will never eat again or don't want to eat again.  Anthony boxes cigars.  What?  I think I talked over him.  It was a stealth one.  Oh.  Never want to eat again.  And Nick said Rita Rudner.  Right.  Oh.  Rita Rudner.  It's just not my ear.  Even my fucking lines.  Yeah.  A lot of the day get talked.  I was laughing hard. 
[03:49:00]  I remember hearing it.  That could have meant two more people tonight.  The brokerage.  Brokerage.  Nick DiPaolo.  Tonight.  Belmore, Long Island.  The governor's.  And governor's.  Friday and Saturday.  Levittown.  Sure.  Honorary guest.  Bella Rally's on the ground.  Clark Gillies.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  York, Pennsylvania.  Police say a man was killed because he had a similar nickname as the attacker's attended  target.  Oh, no.  Ted Nogger got beat up. 
[03:49:30]  Ted Nogger.  What the fuck?  I missed that one.  I did, too.  I hate to admit it.  Oh, what the joke was?  Well, kind of.  No, no, no, no.  I'm saying when he said it the first time.  We have a problem with listening on this show.  We've acknowledged that in the past.  Another runner-up line of the day.  And I never realized an eyeball could stink so much.  Literally, I bit into it.  It's like an explosion of blood.  Yeah.  And, like, gristle in his eyeball.  It's like Iraq's freshen-up gum.  That was a bit brutal there, Iraq. 
[03:50:00]  I apologize.  No one was buying into the fact that he was trying to say that he was just, like, an ugly  dude and didn't belong on TV.  I mean, I didn't, I just didn't.  We're like, shut up.  I hate that Hugh Grant fucking modesty.  Yeah.  You know, they just keep giving me movies, and I just, shut the fuck up.  You like hookers, and you bang them in a fucking Jetta.  Oh, and his movies suck.  They are, I've not seen one of his movies that were entertaining.  Why would you?  If you had a set of nuts and you like guns, why the fuck would you?  True, true.  You're right. 
[03:50:30]  This guy's a goo gobbler from way back.  Another runner-up line of the day.  I'm doing a goo gobbler.  I'm doing my best work with three minutes left in the show.  Let me tell you, Uncle Frank is a drinker.  I know that Uncle Frank.  He likes to throw a few bags.  Yeah, he's probably at the table.  He's held up his drink.  Yeah, I'm a drunk.  Oh, look at Uncle Frank.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be funny if Uncle Frank never drank and he just had liver cancer?  Fuck. 
[03:51:00]  Wouldn't it be funny?  That's what I like.  He prefaces it.  Like, it's not funny?  How many runner-ups we got left?  One more?  One more.  All right, one more runner-up.  My brother never failed, unlike Aunt Edna's kidneys.  I got one in there.  That was a beauty.  Bill Burr, Helium, tonight through Saturday in Philly.  I'm still here doing the hockey channel. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, you can promote the hell out of it.  All right, line of the day.  AshleyMadison.com, thanks.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Wah, wah.  Hey, guys.  I've actually been married to a black woman for the last 20 years.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  A black president would be a great thing. 
[03:52:00]  Oh, see?  Wow.  I told you.  I have some quote there.  Line of the day.  All right, we're going to step aside, and we might be doing more live radio.  I don't know.  These guys might just sneak out.  No, we won't.  We wouldn't do that, do you?  Yeah, we'll hang around.  We'll leave you hanging.  We'll see.  You don't hear the excitement in our voices?  Seriously, I have a door deal tonight.  I'll stay here till 4 o'clock.  You're not allowed to plug, though.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  I'd like to take his headphones off.  Fuck you, man.  Nick DeFala's been great. 
[03:52:30]  Bill Burr's been great.  I think they're sticking around and doing a little more, and I think they might hook  up with the Hockey Channel, so it could get a little interesting after the break here.  Thanks, guys.  Ant and I will see you tomorrow.  Ant.  Ant's negotiating something that we're not.  A hostage situation.  He has not said shit for the last half hour.  Yes, I did.  He's just creepily typing over there.  Soldiers of fortune.  Look at his mock look of shock on his face.  It's just really annoying me right now.  Paul?  You know you're in acting class, and they said, give me an emotion. 
[03:53:00]  Give me shock.  That was the look on your face.  That's how phony that just looked.  I love how he called him out on it, because he went, who won, me?  You look like part of a death squad from Nicaragua.  Just say hi to them for us.  All right, we're out.  That's his sex game he's playing later.  He's playing a run contra with his girl later on tonight.  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest, the greatest of all time. 
[03:53:30]  Ella, Ella, A, A.  Yeah, we suck.  Oprah and Anthony, y'all. </pre>
