<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with personal anecdotes: Anthony recounted a painful dental experience, while Opie described a near-miss with a running coworker.  Listener Robert then called in with a humorous story about receiving a police escort to avoid being late for a date.  The hosts transitioned into their "WoW" (Women of Wrestling) segment, fielding numerous listener calls sharing their WoW experiences and discussing a proposed central meeting location for WoW fans. They also recapped their interview with Barry Williams from the previous day.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a *Fast Times at Ridgemont High* trivia game, with callers trying to stump Opie and Anthony, who demonstrated surprisingly extensive knowledge of the film.  The hosts interspersed this trivia with criticisms of Patrick Ewing's performance for the New York Knicks and brief mentions of their perceived rivalry with Don and Mike. Throughout this section, homophobic slurs and racial epithets were used repeatedly.

The show then shifted to an internal conflict.  A producer, Rick, had been involved in a prank orchestrated against Opie and Anthony without their prior knowledge, a fake fight involving others. This led to a heated confrontation, with the hosts expressing anger over Rick's perceived disloyalty and violation of their "family" dynamic. The hosts detailed their expectations of loyalty and trust within the show's inner circle, referencing past incidents to emphasize their point.  The discussion escalated into a detailed account of a retaliatory prank played on Rick by Keith – wrapping his car in newspaper, placing a fish and ceramic horse head on it, and leaving a "Fredo" note, referencing Rick's perceived betrayal and earlier involvement in a prank against a guest, Jay Moore. Rick’s subsequent reaction, including the destruction of studio property, was discussed at length. Callers weighed in on the situation, alongside calls on unrelated topics such as a "Precious Loves Brittany" sign seen on TRL and a caller providing cartoon character impressions.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of a previous radio prank that, despite being effective, negatively impacted uninvolved teenagers who were questioned by the police.  This led to an on-air argument where Opie directly confronted a staff member. The hosts acknowledged listener awareness of their personal information, including their home addresses.  They then promoted their upcoming summer kickoff party and road show, followed by a humorous Rockaway Bedding commercial featuring the show's "Spaz."  Crude and offensive jokes about Sean Connery's alleged history of violence against women were made. This transitioned to a call from WNEW employee Gary, who became the target of relentless teasing and insults from the hosts and callers, focusing on his supposed fondness for "90210" and his relationship.  The show ended this segment by praising a group of listeners for their efforts in promoting the "WoW" message through signs at various events, including their near-arrest at MTV's TRL and WWF events, and gave away WWF tickets.

The show concluded with a wrap-up of a band's promotional appearance. A caller then reported seeing a car with a "Spaz sucks" license plate.  The majority of this final segment focused on speculation about a hypothetical *Rocky VI* movie, with Opie, Anthony, and numerous callers suggesting absurd plotlines.  The hosts referenced a previously aired, extremely graphic and sexually explicit bit from the O&A archives titled "Rocky and the Cleveland Steamer."  The "What Did We Learn" segment followed, featuring listener calls summarizing the show's chaotic flow with humorous recaps and inside jokes, involving listeners with nicknames like "Uncle John," "Eli," "Pauly," and "Wolf." Finally, the show concluded with a discussion of Spaz's recent nightclub appearance promoting the show, including details of his on-stage performance, self-deprecating humor, and an interaction with the main performer.  The hosts promoted upcoming segments featuring Stephanie McMahon and Spaz's Week in Review.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fags!  1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A Show.  I don't know, I hope you got the phone number by now.  212-757-1027.  Fax line if you're working.  212-957-9639.  Let's say hi to my buddy, my pal, Anthony.  What's up?  How are you? 
[00:00:30]  I'm just reading some instant feedback for you.  What are they saying?  Are they happy?  I just started reading at the computer online here.  Okay.  I'm in pain today.  What's the matter?  I got my teeth scraped today.  Scrape?  Clean?  Nah, they used to call it a cleaning.  It's just an all-out scraping now.  When you were a kid, it was easy.  They put that little rubber thing.  They put some bubble gum flavored stuff on it.  Kind of went around your teeth.  Okay, rinse. 
[00:01:00]  Now they use a big ice pick and jets of water that taste like salt water.  And if you're like me and you only get your teeth cleaned every, like, two years, there could be some problems in there.  What are they pulling out?  Boulders.  Smurfs.  Boulders, man.  So now I'm holding off.  It's all sore.  Yeah, it hurts for a while.  Yeah, it does hurt.  Spitting out these big things, big globs.  What's up, Ben?  What's wrong?  I was just coming down the hall to, you know, come down to the show. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  And I'm coming around the corner there by the printer and stuff.  And Sam from sales is sitting there reading something.  I almost got taken down by spaz going about 120.  He literally almost crashed into me.  He was running so fast.  I was coming around the corner.  He's going, he's hoping he's a one-sheet right now.  It's funny.  You know, I love spaz, though.  You tell him to do something, the guy is right on top of it.  He runs like a maniac.  He runs like a maniac. 
[00:02:00]  You know?  He's stupid and all, but he works really hard.  You know?  I just casually said, you know, spaz, I need the one-sheet for today.  We put a one-sheet of things we want to talk about and this and that together.  And it wasn't in the studio.  So I go, spaz, I need the one-sheet.  It wasn't like, oh, my God, I need the one-sheet.  Right, you need it now.  It was just like, yeah, spaz, you know, when you get a chance, get the one-sheet.  You know, we're getting the show together here.  And I guess he almost took you out, sprinting down the hall.  Cool.  Look, I've got to go for a week. 
[00:02:30]  Let's go to Robert.  You didn't go to New York Radio.  Hold on, Robert.  You didn't go to New York Radio Message Board's Alan Sniffen for your cleaning, did you?  No, but if he's part of the after plan, I'll go to him.  You should go there?  Yeah, why not?  That'd be good.  You could discuss radio as he scrapes your teeth.  Please.  No, it was worse today.  So I'm getting my teeth, you know, scraped like crazy.  And the lady doing my teeth, she's watching Martha Stewart.  I'm like, oh, can't you, like, put porno on or something? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  At the dentist.  Anything.  Can't even get good music.  No.  But Martha Stewart.  But it's between that and, I guess, Regis and Kathy Lee, you know.  Come on.  Oh, well.  Let's go back to Robert.  I put him on hold here.  Hi, Robert.  What's up?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  What's up, Robert?  Just got a quick story.  First of all, you know, I've been separated about 14 months.  Anthony, it only gets worse, man.  Cool.  I was, I had a quick story about my girlfriend.  I was, you know, I was supposed to go see her and I was late. 
[00:03:30]  So she called me on the cell phone in the car and I was going upstate.  She says, where are you?  I said, well, I'm on my way.  She said, I just got out of the shower.  I'm lying here on the bed with just a towel on and nothing else.  And I said, oh, I'm on my way.  I'm going.  I'm going.  So I take off.  I'm doing about 85 miles an hour.  I get pulled over by a local gendarme and he says, do you know how fast you were going?  I said, yeah, I know how fast I was going.  I said, I'm going to see my girlfriend.  He says, yeah, right. 
[00:04:00]  I've heard that.  I said, no, no, really.  She's lying on the bed.  She's almost naked.  She's waiting for me.  And I say, listen, call her.  We'll find out.  So I get on my cell phone.  The guy gets on the cell phone, talks to my girlfriend, hands it back to me and says,  follow me.  He gave you a police escort so you could get laid?  To the exit.  Oh.  That was the greatest.  And where were you?  Like what town?  It was actually just past Slowsburg. 
[00:04:30]  Slowsburg.  Ah, Slowsburg.  He gave you a police escort to get laid.  He gave you an escort to the exit.  Yeah.  That is awesome.  That's why we love the police.  That's a cop that understands.  That's a cop.  Your phone's breaking up, but thank God you got the story on the air, man.  Yeah, thank you.  That's a great story to start the show off with today.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Robert.  Love you guys.  All right.  We like you, too.  Hey, yum.  Another man buying his freedom, huh?  Freedom.  That's great, though. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  The cops have a sense of humor out there.  They certainly do.  They understand.  Wade, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm wondering if these new WoW stickers work.  Yes, they do.  I was reading a ton of email from people before the show that got WoWed yesterday.  Okay.  Well, here's the deal.  It's like I got this guy who works for me.  I'm older.  I'm married.  I get WoWed when my wife is crunching in the bathroom, so, you know, I don't need to worry  about it.  But I got this guy who works for me, 23 years old.  His name's Ralph.  He wants to get WoWed.  So we go out to Ranch One.  We get the stickers.  He's driving around all day yesterday waiting to get WoWed. 
[00:05:30]  He's listening to your show hearing that there's girls wanting to find someone to WoW.  Yeah.  Can't we have, like, a WoW dating game and, like, send them to him?  Because he's, like, driving around wasting gas.  No, that's what WoW's about.  You know, the randomness of it.  Yeah, we'll be honest with you.  That's the one problem with WoW.  There's a lot of people with the WoW stickers, and a lot of girls that want to WoW.  They just have to, like, hook up.  Yeah.  I mean, can't you guys, like, publicize a centralized WoWing location, and we can all go there?  Well, you know what?  Yesterday, we didn't really focus on WoW because Barry Williams was here, Greg Brady. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I heard that.  And we had, like, two and a half hours of fun with him.  Yeah.  And I want to thank him again for stopping by and getting our show and having fun with us.  He understands the Opie and Anthony show.  He was able to come in and participate.  Yeah.  It's a good thing, and he didn't really mind the way you were picking on the Johnny Bravo.  No, not at all.  He's got a sense of humor about it.  You know, that's pretty cool.  A lot of those people from, you know, child stars and stuff, a whole bunch of a-holes.  They can't take a joke about themselves.  Yeah.  Well, the deal is, though, because we spent so much time on Barry Williams, we didn't focus on WoW yesterday 
[00:06:30]  because usually we'll have the girls call and say, hi, I'm on the, you know, the Jersey Turnpike at exit, blah, blah, you know.  Right.  So we can narrow it down a little better than just randomly like it happened yesterday.  All right.  Then the other suggestion would be how about we do a whip them out all week, a W-O-A-W.  I don't know how you pronounce it.  Well, a lot of people are confused.  A long time ago, we changed it to whip them out whenever.  Oh, okay.  You know, but it's more or less, you know, on Wednesday, we'll focus on it.  You know, we can't spend every day focusing on WoW because then it's going to get boring real fast. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, you got a point there.  All right, listen, syndication whenever.  All right, take care.  Thank you, Wade.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, you're next on NEW.  How are you?  Hello.  Hey, Frank.  Hey, what's up, Bo?  What's up?  I got a quick question for Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes.  Did you watch a Brady bunch last night or the Nick game?  What?  The Brady Bunch or the Nick game?  Anthony.  The Brady Bunch?  What was...  It was on Nickelodeon last night with the Nick game.  Oh, no, I thought you meant the movie, which is what, Sunday? 
[00:07:30]  I did watch the Brady Bunch a little bit because I was flipping around like crazy because the  Knicks were driving me nuts last night.  Oh, my God.  And I could not watch the Brady Bunch after, you know, listening to Barry Williams yesterday  for two and a half hours.  Yeah, it's kind of funny now to turn it on.  Yeah.  You just picture him banging Marsha, trying to bang his mom.  Yeah, it was just a little too real or surreal, I should say.  A little frightening.  He was funny yesterday.  Yeah, he was a lot of fun.  Because a lot of you guys said, oh, man, Barry Williams, Greg Brady coming into the show,  this is going to suck.  Yeah, what are we going to do?  But a lot of you guys got turned around and said, man, that was some fun radio yesterday. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, he was good.  So, cool.  All right, guys.  What about the Knicks yesterday, bro?  Oh, my God, they gave me a heart attack.  Man, what's...  Think they're going to win tomorrow night?  No.  They lost, didn't they, last night?  Yeah, they did.  Oh, they did.  See, I knew that.  You got to get Patrick Ewing out of there.  Kill him.  Boy, what a surprise, Ewing letting us down again.  I think he shot 36% from the field last night.  He's horrible.  Thanks, Patrick.  Nice brick at the end of the game on the, you know, from the foul line when it mattered.  He has a deal like our old boss has. 
[00:08:30]  You can just keep effing up and effing up and not performing and not giving what is expected of you,  and you just linger.  He's a missing link.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thanks, Frank.  Bye.  Yeah, you can put that in there.  Justin, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Yeah, I got to ask you a question.  Yeah.  All right, a long time ago, you guys had this Spanish girl on the show,  and she was telling you how she does favors for her boyfriend,  but he never makes any noise or something.  So she was asking you guys what she does wrong, right?  Yeah.  And I think it was opiate or something he was asking. 
[00:09:00]  He's like...  No, it's Anthony.  I know what you're going to say.  What?  It's Anthony's...  The Charles Bronson face.  Yeah.  Oh, the Charles Bronson face.  What is the Charles Bronson face?  Driving me and my friends crazy.  You ever see Charles Bronson in a movie?  Yeah.  He puts that face on where his lips are, like, pulled over his teeth.  Yeah.  So his lips are covering his teeth.  Oh, so it's that.  All right.  And, yeah.  Yeah, you know...  Kind of like working on giving him, like, a gum job or something right there.  Yeah, you just, you know, you want to cover those teeth with your lips.  It's the Charles Bronson face.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  So we encourage the ladies to do the Charles Bronson face.  They want to get out, so I dig...  I dig...  ...when they're going to give the armor.  Oh, yeah?  So, yeah.  Definitely.  All right, cool.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Kind of just doing open phones here.  We've got a lot of things to do today, but, Brian, what's going on?  Not much, man.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  I was at the Yankee game yesterday, and I decided to bring a wow sign.  I was right down in front by the White Sox bench.  Finally started to get some girls into it, and I get them to basically wow me with just the broad first. 
[00:10:00]  So the security comes over, threatening them, threatening me, and then finally I guess the girls got a little more rowdy,  take the tops off, and they're getting escorted out.  Well, I'm saying that basically I might be charged with inciting a riot, but they let me stay because I calmed down.  And then I got an Attica chant going and claiming that the Yankee Stadium was not located in the United States anymore.  And basically by the end of it, we were escorted out by the fine people of the NYPD for wowing. 
[00:10:30]  Brian, one question I got for you.  Yeah.  How many beers did you have last night?  Oof.  Yeah, okay.  Lots.  I mean, you know, it was definitely alcohol-induced, but...  Did you have fun?  Oh, it was a great time, great time.  And I just wanted to say sorry to the girls because I felt horrible for, you know, getting them to show us, and then they get booted.  Clemens looked good last night, huh?  Beautiful, beautiful.  I hate you.  Right at the height, you know, the Grand Slam, and then, you know, just basically chugging more beers because they wouldn't serve you.  It's kind of odd.  They don't serve you more beers until you finish the ones you have, so if you have a half a beer and the guy passes by, you end up pounding that one. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  To get to the next one.  So, you know, they're making you drink more.  It's their fault.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  Well, you're getting back to basketball.  You know, Ewing was 7-12 on the field, had 16 points, 10 rebounds.  I believe it was Houston that really killed them.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to give Aaron a chance to abuse me because I said the wrong thing.  Aaron, good.  It was Mike from Jersey.  Aaron.  Yeah.  I don't know anything.  Yeah, Ewing did shoot better than 32%.  You're right.  Thank you.  Sorry about that.  No problem.  I just got so pissed off, I just started babbling. 
[00:11:30]  It's all good.  All right.  I love you guys.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Still sucks.  Everyone knows I'm not a huge Ewing supporter, so.  True.  Everyone does know that.  He was 7-12, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty good shooting for the field.  Actually, Houston let us down last night, but you're just like bashing Ewing.  Yeah.  I blame all the Knicks problems on Ewing, and it's just easy that way. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  And you were like the mad dog there with the stats.  That's right.  I pull them up there.  Well, I got an email.  What do you think?  I know that stuff offhand.  I never understood how they did that.  I'll be Ewing, 7-12 on the field, at 16 points to 10 rebounds.  I think it was Houston that disappointed the team and the fans.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Hello, boys.  Hey, man.  I sent in an envelope to Earl.  Yeah.  He sent me like 30 stickers in like four days. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  And I had them all out yesterday.  You're like the sticker of the month club.  He keeps sending them.  I was on the road yesterday.  It was like a frigging sausage party.  I did not get wabbered with all the stickers I have, man.  Just have patience.  Put it on your car, and just go about your business.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Calm a chameleon, baby.  When you're playing, I'm going.  I got that all queued up if you want it.  Yeah.  No.  Please.  All right, man.  Thank you, Andrew.  All right.  Joe would like to blame Van Gundy. 
[00:13:00]  Joe.  How you doing?  All right.  I would like to express about Van Gundy because he didn't put in Charlie Ward how he's been doing  so great.  My man, Van Gundy, would have been a Charlie Ward.  Yeah, Ward's.  I believe that would have helped out the next.  Well, Ward's on fire.  You got to keep him in there.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, my God.  You got to.  He's been doing so great, even on defense.  I got a better question for you, though.  When is Jeff Van Gundy going to get the rest of those hair plugs?  He started the process about two or three seasons ago, and it's just kind of sitting 
[00:13:30]  there.  It's like, dude.  Not finishing it, huh?  It's like, I got to do something with him, too.  It's like, are you going to commit and go the distance and get the whole head filled  up, or are you just going to leave it like you just went through chemo?  Oh.  No, I'm serious.  It's been driving me nuts.  Like, two seasons ago, he started getting the hair plugs, and he stopped.  Did he run out of money or something?  Maybe his job's in jeopardy.  No, I don't think so.  I think we got him for a few more years.  A few more years.  Well, then he started playing Charlie Ward.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Amanda.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  I was just wondering, were you guys listening to Don and Mike at all yesterday?  Um, no.  Because at about, I'd say about 7.30, they're pretty much whining about Ron and Fez and Scott  and Sid getting an ad in one of the trades, and then they started whining about being tape  delayed in New York City.  Well, you know, that's where they stay. 
[00:14:30]  Hey.  And they were, you know, whining about how, you know, they have the greatest ratings,  blah, blah, blah.  You know, I'm not trying to turn it into you guys versus them or anything, but I just felt  that they're so high on themselves, and them whining about you guys being in their slot  isn't going to get them anywhere.  No, they're broadcasting live from New York today and tomorrow, and the fact is, you know,  we have better ratings than them, and it's the Opie and Anthony Station.  You know, they were saying, oh, we're number one in this, Mike, at this.  I was like, who cares?  They're doing great where they are. 
[00:15:00]  You know, but why should they bring their puppet attitude on us?  Like, I really don't care for it.  Right.  I don't know.  They shouldn't be bashing everyone, though.  We're trying to make a go of it here.  It's a one big happy family, isn't it?  Oh, yeah, right.  For now it is.  All right.  Syndication, whatever, guys.  Thank you, Amanda.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  All right.  Everyone wants to talk about the Knicks.  Go to the fan.  No, no.  They lost.  I'm frustrated.  Yeah, I know.  Houston never showed up last night.  It is Ewing's fault, someone is saying.  Yeah, it's not the fan over here.  Buy Ewing a ring. 
[00:15:30]  He'll never win one.  I know, I know.  I'm sure the fan's been talking about this for 15 hours straight.  Go over there.  I want to apologize to Patrick Ewing for any racist remarks I might have made.  It's the new sensitive Don Imus.  Yeah, that's what he's saying in the paper today.  Yeah, yeah.  So you won't hear any racist remarks from me.  And shut up, Bernard.  They'll be talking about the colored or nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And my fag cowboy hat.  Whoa, whoa. 
[00:16:00]  My homosexual cowboy hat.  Baby.  Can't say fag, baby.  The new sensitive.  No, you can't.  You can't.  You can't go in the paper and say you're toning down the show and making it more sensitive and stuff.  Toning down the show.  It's quaaludes.  Tell your critics to, you know, go F themselves.  Yes.  And just continue doing your show.  Absolutely.  Anthony, let's take a break.  All right.  All right.  We're just getting started here.  See the list of restaurants and the daily news and what's going on at some of these places? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  We can talk about that next.  That's frightening.  Every single one of them has vermin.  What's vermin?  Rats and mice and vermin.  Vermin.  That's frightening.  And some of the other things.  Like, and these are places people need that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's take a quick break.  Yeah.  We'll come back, I guess, and talk about that a little because that's scary.  And they're popular places.  Yeah.  I guess you could start.  All right.  We'll talk about it next.  Stay there.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  No more Nick talk for now.  We'll be back.  Stay there. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, this is Barry Williams.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Anthony, I got news for you.  I made out with Marsha.  So bite me.  Opie and Anthony.  What's that?  Why is Anthony?  1027-WNEW.  Let's go to Laura real fast.  Laura, what's going on today?  Not much.  Yesterday, my boyfriend and I, we work at a flower shop.  And I went into him.  I followed him into the fridge.  And he said, you know, it's Whippin' Out Wednesday, right? 
[00:17:30]  I said, yeah, I know.  So I whipped it out for him.  Nice.  There was a lot of people there.  I was a little worried about the danger.  But I did it for you guys.  Danger's all good.  Danger's great.  Danger adds to the excitement.  Oh, it made me so excited.  Not knowing if you're going to get caught or not, you know.  It was really cold in that fridge, too, so.  You were nipping out?  Yep.  Well, Laura, thanks for helping us out.  We're Whippin' Out Wednesday.  No problem.  All right, man. 
[00:18:00]  Thanks.  There she goes, Laura.  It's happening, guys.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Just get the wow on the car and wait to see what happens, okay?  Yeah.  Anthony, we got to talk about Fast Times at Ridgemont High real fast.  Yeah, true.  We're in the office.  We didn't get to watch much of it, you know?  Yeah.  Because we had to start the radio show, but.  We just checked out the scene.  Yeah, we got to check.  Well, Spaz, he comes in with Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  We bring in movies all the time, and he waits to almost showtime to tell us he's got Fast 
[00:18:30]  Times at Ridgemont High.  Yeah.  So we are able to, you know, cue up the scene, the greatest scene in movie history before the  radio show.  Phoebe Cates.  Moving in stereo, the cars.  Coming out of the pool.  Oh.  On Desert Top.  And it's just the best scene in a movie.  Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Perfect.  How many times did we see the scene before the show?  Perfect scene.  We just kept rewatching. 
[00:19:00]  That's all we watched.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Fabulous.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  She dives in the pool.  Slow motion comes up the ladder.  Gives that little smile.  Shakes the water out of her hair.  Yeah.  Climbs out of the pool.  And there's the mist going off behind her, and she's walking, and then she just opens  up the top on her bikini, revealing those beautiful Phoebe Cates boobage. 
[00:19:30]  Fuck.  It got stuck in my head right now.  And then idiot Brad is whacking it in the bathroom and gets on.  Does anyone knock?  Doesn't anyone effing knock anymore?  Yeah.  Anyway.  I don't know.  We thought maybe we could do a little Fast Times at Ridgemont High trivia today, real  fast, to give out some prizes.  Yeah.  We got some stuff to give away.  We got, like, wrestling tickets. 
[00:20:00]  We have Warped Tour tickets and Opie and Anthony prize packages.  We got to make it hard, though.  What do you mean?  We got to make the questions hard, because everyone has seen the movie a million times.  Well, the deal is, they have to stump us with a trivia question from Fast Times at Ridgemont  High.  Yeah.  They stump us, they get a prize.  So it's up to how hard the questions are that they come up with.  Because most people come up with the same questions, you know?  They're pretty easy. 
[00:20:30]  So if you wanted to try to stump us with Fast Times at Ridgemont High trivia, we'll do this  real fast.  212-757-1027.  Asia, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I just wanted to tell you, I was up in your old stomping ground yesterday in Boston.  Yeah.  And I'd never wowed before, and I saw a truck with a wow sticker on it, and I was like,  well, why the hell not?  So I whipped them out.  And how did it feel?  It was liberating, let me tell you.  Very good.  You got to do it down here in the New York area for everyone.  I know, I have to. 
[00:21:00]  The problem is, I drive too fast.  It's a little hard for me to do it on a regular basis.  Well, you got to slow down every once in a while and flash those boobies for us, all right?  Now, did she see a wow sticker up there?  Was it one of the ones from down here?  Yeah, it was one of the new ones.  I was surprised.  I think he had New York plates, so it made sense.  But I was like, hey, what are the chances of me seeing a New York license plate and a  wow sticker in Boston?  So I tried it.  Hey, cool.  Why the hell not, right?  Nice. 
[00:21:30]  Well, thank you, Asia.  Thank you very much.  All right, there she goes.  Okay, guys.  Another Lady Wow, and it's happening.  Yeah.  Andy said you forgot something about the famous scene in Fast Times.  What?  Andy.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Remember that?  That's the best part of that whole awesome scene.  When she's just coming out of the water, she brushes her hair back, and a little bit  of water comes off of her lips.  She opens her mouth.  Everyone has examined that scene.  Oh, yeah.  Frame by frame.  Everyone did exactly what he did in that scene. 
[00:22:00]  That was great.  Hey, that's good, Andy.  Later, guys.  All right, bye.  The water coming off her lips.  We all remember the details.  Yeah.  All right, let's see if anyone can stump us with their Fast Times at Ridgemont High trivia.  Okay.  Let's start with Kevin.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, Owen, eh?  All right.

All right, man.  Well, you'll get it.  All right, dude.  We've been backed up a little bit.  All right, dude.  All right, man.  All right.  That was easy.

[00:23:30]  There's some chick.  Hold on.  I can't remember her name, and I used to know this.  It's kind of a weird name.  Give me a hint.  What?  Give me the first.  What do you want?

James, paper plane.  Sales in front of us.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  James, what's up? 
[00:44:30]  How are you doing?  Good.  All right.  When the convenience store at the end is getting robbed, what's the safe behind?  What's the safe behind?  Yeah.  He was giving them the money out of the residence.  He goes, no, I want the money out of the safe.  He's like, I ain't got no safe.  Oh, it's behind the donuts.  No.  It was behind the donuts, dude.  Behind the Twinkies.  No, no, no.  It was...  He never said Twinkies.  What?  Behind the donuts?  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, that's what he...  Wasn't it behind the Twinkies?  No.  Behind the donuts.  Behind the donuts?  Yeah.  All right.  I've been watching this place.  It's behind the donuts.  But he does move a tray of Twinkies.  But it's actually behind the donuts.  Trick question.  Yeah.  All right, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave.  Yo.  You're next on WNEW.  How are you?  Hey.  How you doing?  Good, man.  What was on Spicoli's pizza that he ordered for class? 
[00:45:30]  Well, that was actually a film flub, but...  Maybe.  Could have been ground up.  It was deviled cheese and sausage.  Yeah.  But it looked like a plain pizza.  Yeah.  All right.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Let's go to Frank.  Hey, Frank.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Great.  Okay.  When Rat and Stacy are on their date, what two tragedies befall Rat?  Oh, my God.  First of all, he got his wallet.  That's one.  At his house.  At his house.  And then driving home, his sister's stereo got ripped off. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You guys are good.  Take it easy.  All right, man.  Let's go right.  I think more tragic than either of those is him not getting laid.  No.  Jesus.  Everyone else pounded her.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  I have a question for you.  Yes.  Here's one.  What happened to Damone at the end of the movie?  Oh, I ended up working at the 7-Eleven.  No, no, no, no.  He was busted for scalping Aussie tickets.  Oh, you guys got me.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Yeah, but he did end up working at the 7-Eleven because that's what happened. 
[00:46:30]  If he couldn't scalp tickets anymore, he had to get a job at the 7-Eleven.  7-Eleven, so.  Boy, we need lives.  We so need lives.  Let's go to Mark.  Hey, Mark.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yo, what kind of car did the stereo salesman drive?  Oh, yeah.  That was a Datsun 280Z, dude.  All right.  Let's drive one of us.  Give me a question for you really quick while I'm on. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  I need a...  I've been trying to get in for two weeks to get this wow promoter, dude.  Really?  I'm right on the Thrasmec Bridge, a school called Maritime College.  Okay.  Every year, they go out to sea for two months, a whole bunch of guys, a whole bunch of cadets  that want to work on the ocean.  Yeah.  Saturday, 10 o'clock.  If I can get any chick on the boat to wow this shit, these guys are going to have to  sea for two months straight.  Send them off with some, you know, a few little kids before they go off, man.  Put them off with a smile.  All right.  You just said it.  Let's see what happens.  Thanks, dude.  All right.  Go on, man.  Thank you, Mark. 
[00:47:30]  Let's go to Louis.  We just need one more person to stump us.  Louis, what's up?  Oh, hey.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  The manager's name is All-American Burger.  Did we answer that already?  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Dennis.  Dennis.  All right.  Dennis Taylor.  Dennis Taylor.  One more question?  Yeah.  The two girls that he said hello to driving up in his car going to school, what did he  say?  I don't remember.  We already got you.  First, he said looking good.  Yeah.  And then he...  What was the girl's name?  The other girl.  The other girl's name? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I don't know, but he said, I make you see God.  Denise.  Denise.  He goes, Denise, I'll make you see God.  Yeah, I don't remember the name, though.  Yeah.  Thank you, Louis.  No package?  No.  We got your first question.  All right, dude.  Let me get one.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah, how you doing?  Stump us.  In the men's room at the burger place.  Yeah.  What did it say on the mirror when Brad was wiping it?  When Brad was wiping the...  That's one of the funniest things in movie history. 
[00:48:30]  I don't even know if we can say it on the air.  He's cleaning off.  It says, Big Hairy P-Word.  Yeah, you guys are good.  All right, man.  I want to know what the first word said.  Jonathan.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what was the name of the coffee that Mr. Vargas had switched to in the morning  because he was a little bit slow?  Switched to Sanka, yeah.  You guys are the best.  All right, man.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  We must have seen that a million times.  Jesus.  All right, let's go to Mark.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, by the way, on the edited version, on the mirror, it said something different. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, I know.  I forgot what that was.  The TV version.  The TV version of that movie blows.  Yeah, it really does.  I think it was going to say to eat me or something stupid.  What was the final score of the football game?  The final score of the football game?  Yeah.  Oof.  Wow.  Ridgemont and Lincoln.  I don't know.  Wow, wow, wow.  Was it, uh, was Lincoln zero?  Yes, Lincoln was zero.  And, uh, it was like, I don't know. 
[00:49:30]  I think, I think they were, what?  Spaz coming in with an answer?  Spaz, do you know?  Well, 42?  42.  Oh, you pulled out of your bike.  Spaz!  Oh, I'll take Spaz's assist on that one.  Wow.  Spaz.  We're still alive, baby.  I'd give you that zero.  Thanks, Mark.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, we're still alive.  Thanks to Spaz.  Hey, Rob.  Yeah.  How are you?  Doing pretty well, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Who did Ron Johnson work for?  Ron Johnson, stereo salesman? 
[00:50:00]  What was his company?  What store?  Whoa, that's a tough one.  I thought stereo salesman would be good enough.  Stereo salesman.  Oh, man.  Ron Johnson.  He did say it.  He was wearing a button.  Really?  God, I don't remember this.  Damn.  I know he was an audio consultant.  He was 26 years old.  I can't close it.  He's older. 
[00:50:30]  I don't remember.  Oh, I think he finally got us.  You want to know it?  Uh, this better be right, too, you son of a bitch.  Don't say Radio Shack.  No.  All right, what's the answer?  Pacific stereo.  Ah-ha.  Very good.  Yes.  Pacific stereo.  I got them full of them.  Very good.  What textbook did Spicoli forget in his locker?  What?  What textbook did Spicoli forget in his locker?  Oh, that's a history book.  Yeah.  When Mr. Hand came in?  Yeah.  The Land of Truth and Liberty. 
[00:51:00]  You got it.  Yeah.  All right, man.  WWF tickets, guys?  No, yeah, you won the SmackDown ticket.  Ah, I love you guys.  Cool.  All right, man.  Hey, Rob, thanks a lot.  Thank you, guys.  All right, hold down the line, okay?  Not bad.  Damn.  Ron Johnson, stereo salesman.  Oh, my God.  Man, that was kind of fun.  Yeah.  We realize we have no life.  We're going to have to do that with another movie soon.  Maybe Caddyshack or something. 
[00:51:30]  That one's easy.  Stripes.  Yeah.  That would be a little rough.  Stripes would be?  Yeah.  I've seen it a lot of times, but it's been a while.  And I don't know.  Caddyshack.  I don't know.  I don't think anyone could stump us.  That would be tough.  Got to do Animal House.  Animal House, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll bring this back again.  We'll do another.  Not now, so hold your calls.  Right.  Cool.  Now everyone's going to study and get the really hard questions.  You did very well, people.  Well, that was fun.  Good questions.  All right, let's regroup.  We'll be back.  Our phone number's 212-757-1027. 
[00:52:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Yes, the season finale of ER tonight, Anthony.  Did you watch the 9-0-2-1-0 finale, Opie?  No.  Good.  I was watching the Knicks, you idiot.  Yeah, I didn't either.  Does every season finale have to end with a wedding?  Yeah.  I think ER's breaking that mold.  They will not have a wedding tonight as part of the season finale.  You definitely get distracted by this music in the background. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Beer factory.  Someone's asking if we should get Gary from upstairs to get the 9-0-2-1-0 season finale review.  The review?  Yeah.  He was so pussy-whipped yesterday, he had to go home, run right home, so he could watch it. 
[00:53:00]  I'm sure we could get him on the phone really fast.  I guess the Psycho Mark psychopaths are all over TRL today.  Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, brother?  How are you?  All right, listen, I'm going downstairs.  I'm going a little longer.  I'm going down the shore tonight.  I turn on Channel 22 MTV.  It's over here in Warbridge.  And I see a Precious Loves Brittany sign.  Precious Loves Brittany?  It's a beautiful one, and I see a couple of Whippin' Out Wednesday signs.  You know how it is?  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Let me do an impression for you guys.  What do you want to hear?  Whatever you want to do.  Go ahead.  You tell me what you like.  Whatever you want to do.  Let's go.  Just pick one.  How do I do Barney from The Simpsons?  Okay.  Hey, I'm a rock.  I'm the mayor.  Okay.  You do something else?  Do Popeye?  When are you going to do Barney?  Huh?  All right, let's hear Popeye.  Let's hear Popeye.  Are you ready?  You're very brave to do Popeye.  Look up here.  Look up here.  What am I doing?  Fuck.  Do, do, do, do.  Wow, sleepy.  Okay, that ain't bad. 
[00:54:00]  That's pretty good.  It's gone.  It's over the phone.  Come down.  Right.  What else?  What do you want to hear?  I don't know.  Just you've done them a million times.  Do what's in your repertoire.  All right.  Let's see.  How would I do some of the better ones?  Tell me what you want to hear.  I'd do anything.  Do them, dude.  If you had your radio show, you've got to just do them.  I hear that.  Let's see.  What do you want to hear?  Give me that.  Oh.  Time's up, Dennis.  All right.  All right.  All right, Dennis. 
[00:54:30]  So long.  Thanks for the curse.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Let's go to Zach.  Zach, you're next on NAW.  Hello.  Hey, Zach.  Hey.  What's up?  I just saw on TV some guy that had the Precious Loves Britney sign.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just got that call.  Thank you, Zach.  Okay.  Syndication, it's like Spaz made it.  Thank you. 
[00:55:00]  John, what's up?  Yeah.  John, what's up?  Yeah.  Have you guys heard?  There's a Precious Loves Britney sign on TRL.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  Cool.  And a lot of wow signs.  Oh, and I said that thing about my dad's porno.  Yeah, it made a promo already.  I didn't think you guys were going to actually do it.  I thought you were just humoring me.  No.  No, what are you kidding?  That is awesome.  We thought it was a funny line.  We made a little promo out of it.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Bye.  I guess the guy with the Precious Loves Britney sign is now on line one. 
[00:55:30]  Josh.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Was that you?  Precious.  Yeah, that was me.  That was me doing anything for this show, guys.  Everyone's calling like crazy.  Yeah, well, you know, hey, we were the ones who got the signs from Mulcahy.  Some cop ripped it out of our hands.  We couldn't get it back.  Oh, really?  He wanted to arrest us, but he's probably going to be hanging in his room later.  You know what I mean?  All right.  So Carson Daly never looked so gay than today, right?  Pretty gay.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys rule. 
[00:56:00]  You own the radio dial.  Yes.  Thank you.  We're going to come up in a little bit and say hello.  And I've been taping the show, so it's syndication in my Honda.  All right.  Thank you.  You got it, buddy.  Thanks for that sign on MTV today, Josh.  You got it.  You mind if we stop on by and say hello?  Come on.  A long time listener.  Real quick.  All right.  We'll let you in.  All right.  You're the man.  Thank you.  All right, man.  We'll see you in a little bit.  Everyone's saying no, no, no.  The guy did something for the show.  You got to let him in.  Yeah, that's true.  That's the rules.  That is the rules.  You get a sign that has something to do with this radio show on live TV, you come down 
[00:56:30]  and hang with us.  That's the rules.  Huh?  Well, he made good.  He stole one sign and then put a sign on TV.  What can I tell you?  We're softies at heart.  Yeah.  So everyone wants to know about Rex Carr, Anthony.  That seems to be the thing everyone's curious about.  We've been talking about it for quite a while.  Well, this happened, what, three weeks ago?  Yeah.  And Rick was in such a tizzy that we couldn't even discuss it.  But it seems things have, the air has cleared a little bit. 
[00:57:00]  And people want to, I guess, know what happened.  He destroyed a bathroom.  He destroyed an office.  He was so pissed off that he stormed off the show, wouldn't even talk to anybody,  went to our office in the back, just started throwing stuff,  went into the public bathroom here in the building,  tore a door off of the stall,  threw it out the bathroom door into the hallway.  He was so pissed because, A, this thing happened, 
[00:57:30]  and, B, we talked about it on the air.  And he said, don't talk about it on the air because I think someone's stalking me.  Well, there's a C, too.  Wow.  There were pictures all over the unofficial website.  Yeah.  Yeah, pictures of the incident were all over the unofficial website.  Well, we could tell the story.  Yeah.  If Rick wants in, he could come in here.  If not, whatever.  About three weeks ago?  No, it goes back a month and a half, two months ago. 
[00:58:00]  Well, do we even have to do that in that order?  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Why not?  Tell what happened and then discuss why it happened.  Well, no, because you've got to tell the story from the beginning.  Okay.  Rick was part of a prank against Aunt Nye.  Mm-hmm.  He went against the show.  I did not.  He went against the show.  That's not even an issue.  Everyone knows it, except Rick.  Now, Rick, you went against the show.  You knew something.  You knew of a conspiracy against Aunt Nye and Anthony. 
[00:58:30]  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  And instead of informing us, you let it go, which, in my opinion, is turning on us.  Right.  Not turning.  It's the famous Billy and Paul J. Moore prank.  Right.  Where there was the fake fight and stuff, and Rick knew about it.  Rick knew about it a couple days before.  Yeah.  And it got so ugly that I punched someone in the face.  Yeah.  Because I thought it was still real.  I didn't punch Paul because, you know, I was so pissed that they got us. 
[00:59:00]  I punched him because I thought it was still real, and he was coming after me.  Yeah.  So, Rick knew.  Didn't inform us, so we could have turned it around on them in some way, shape, or form.  Okay.  All of us could have put our heads together.  Yeah.  Now, let me give you a little background.  Mm-hmm.  If you remember back to the Homeless Shopping Spree show.  Yeah.  What was I getting railed on?  I don't know.  By Jay.  I have no clue.  Jay comes on the air.  Rick said not to come down because you guys were doing the Homeless Shopping Spree and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:59:30]  And you guys, you know, we had a lot of stuff going on in the studio.  And what did you say?  Don't ever listen to Rick.  Just do what you want to do.  No, no, no.  We worked.  All right.  So, basically, Rick, first of all, that's a whole different issue.  We worked.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We worked that whole thing out.  But here's what leads up to my decision was.  You made a horrible decision with that because we're talking about Jay Moore, a Hollywood star.  And, you know, you want people like that on our show as much as possible.  And it came to our attention that he called the show a few times and you didn't put him through because you thought that we were too busy for Jay Moore, a Hollywood star that gives us good radio. 
[01:00:00]  No.  We worked that part out.  I did say to Jay, don't listen to Rick.  You know, do whatever you want.  Right.  But then I went back to you and I explained exactly how important it is that Jay gets on our show because he puts, you know, puts some good radio.  And regardless, how does that explain how you didn't tell us about the prank?  Well, it quickly goes to the fact that how fast things will turn around against me if I decide something either against you or against Jay. 
[01:00:30]  So Jay comes in and says, oh, well, Rick did this, and then you guys jump on me for that.  Oh, we're going to get mad at you for going against Jay on him pulling a prank on us?  That doesn't, no, no, no, no, no.  Boy, you're on some thin ice here.  If I sell Jay out, then you guys can turn it around easily by going, oh, well, that was a great prank.  Why'd you do that?  Oh, we would never do that.  You don't know us.  I know.  How do I know?  Stop it.  We would never, ever do that. 
[01:01:00]  How do I know this?  Stop it.  How do I know?  Like we would say, oh, boy, that was setting up to make us look like jerk-offs.  Boy, you should have let it keep going.  No, we'd have brainstormed and figured a way out to totally turn it around and take the wind out of their sails.  But you've got to see where I'm coming from.  No, no, no, no, no.  You're trying.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm going, okay, now Jay has free reign.  You're trying so hard.  And I'm being told, on the other hand, that, you know what, you do make the decisions.  Tell him to come at a certain time if you think it's next. 
[01:01:30]  One thing has abso-effing-lutely nothing to do with the other.  It has all.  No, the bottom line, you knew, we didn't.  We were hung out to dry.  You've been working for us for two years.  Mm-hmm.  You don't know the first rule of the show.  Yes.  Which is very simple.  It's us, us, if you're a part of us, against the world.  Well, you see, I'm not a part of you, too.  We can't have.  You guys always said it's you two against everybody.  Oh, stop.  No, we're allowing everyone that is part of this show on a weekly basis to be part of us. 
[01:02:00]  But you're saying, but with that said.  And it's us against the world.  So if someone is conspiring against us, the family, Ant and I, whatever, whatever you want to call it,  you have to, it's a no-brainer to come to us and say, dude, they are planning something, what can we do?  But with that said, with what you just said, you cannot, you can never be a part of us if you're going to conspire against them.  Right.  If you just said, then why would you turn against me if I tell Jane not to come in on a certain day? 
[01:02:30]  That's not, you're talking about something totally different.  I'm talking about levels of where things are going to turn.  You're talking about a secret being kept from this program to be sprung on us at a later date,  not a guest calling up and arranging guest scheduling.  Right.  That's something completely different.  It doesn't even make sense that you're using that to argue this point.  Right.  And that had something to do with the lack of communication that was happening a long time ago.  I think we have settled that.  It goes to the point.  No, no, Rick. 
[01:03:00]  That had something to do with the lack of communication.  We finally worked that out, I believe, between us.  And so that's not even an issue anymore.  To bring that and compare it to what you did to us is ludicrous.  Guest scheduling and a conspiracy against Opie and Anthony are two different things.  Right.  There's a lot of misunderstandings that go on behind the scenes.  That was one of those misunderstandings where I was pissed at you because I found out Jay Moore called the show a couple times,  or let's say even once, and you didn't let him through because you thought we were too busy.  And no one ever came to Ant and I and said, you know what, Jay's trying to get in on the show. 
[01:03:30]  Do we have time to get him on the air or not?  But that was never brought in front of us, so I got pissed.  That's what that was about, and that's a behind-the-scenes thing that we worked out since.  He called me the day of just before we were about to leave to go down to the bus and said, hey, I want to come by.  I'm like, I don't think it's a good idea.  We've got a lot going on today.  I go, tomorrow would be better.  Do it the other thing.  It goes right back to where somebody stands.  No, it doesn't.  Dude, dude, if anybody involved in this show got wind of a prank or a conspiracy against anyone else on this show, 
[01:04:00]  it's a no-brainer that they immediately go to that person and explain what's going on  so we as a team can just get together, think up a way to turn it around, and twice as bad, screw the other person.  Wait, and let me clarify that even further here.  If it's a prank we're doing to each other because we're part of the family, that's one thing. 
[01:04:30]  But you're talking about someone from the outside coming in here and pulling one of the craziest pranks on us.  And we could have stopped it.  If it's us getting together and pranking spaz for good radio, that's great.  That's the family messing with the family.  Right, you're allowed to do that.  Right.  Corleones play with each other.  Right.  But not with Buzz.  Well, when it comes to it on many occasions, you said Jay is a part of the show.  But not with Barzini.  Jay, you've said it.  Jay's a part of the show.  Jay is not a part of the show.  Do you guys consider him a family?  He's not a part of the family. 
[01:05:00]  He's absolutely not a part of this program.  The people that are in this room right now, Spaz, Stinky, the interns, are part of this show, part of the family.  He is a fantastic guest on this program.  And a big part of our show, but he's not part of the show on a daily basis.  Do you understand who is loyal to this program, who is involved in this, who is a part of the show, and who are guests?  I trust Stinky more than Jay Moore, as far as being part of the family.  Right.  Because if this show went down the crapper tomorrow, I don't think it would affect Jay Moore's career. 
[01:05:30]  It would affect everybody else in this room right now's career.  Right.  No, I understand that.  It's all about the guys that spend, you know, three, four hours before the show in the back office, you know, trying to make something happen on a daily basis.  That is part of the family.  You pulled a Fredo.  You watched The Godfather.  Fredo.  Remember?  Remember Fredo?  He said he never met Johnny Ola before.  Shook hands at him.  Hey, this is Johnny Ola. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Like they never met.  And then they went to a club later on.  Fredo got a few in him.  And he goes, yeah, I've been here.  Johnny Ola took me here a while ago.  And I was like, oh, but he said he didn't know Johnny Ola.  Right.  And that's when Michael knew.  But that's not even right.  And when his mother died, they took him fishing.  We've known Jay Moore for a while.  So you can't even use that analogy.  Oh, my God.  I'm using the analogy that you conspired with outside forces against this program.  You absolutely did. 
[01:06:30]  All I did was...  If we're going to move forward, you've got to accept the fact that you did.  All I'm saying is...  What if another radio station, you know, calls you and says,  Hey, Rick, we want to pull a fast one at opening, Anthony.  Well, absolutely not.  That makes sense.  Well, how do we know?  How the loyalty comes in?  But how do we know?  How do we know?  That's a no-brainer.  This should have been a no-brainer.  Because to be honest with you, those guys did make us look pretty silly.  You honestly feel that way?  Yes.  If it was you and Spaz and Psycho Mark and Ben trying to make Ant and I look silly, 
[01:07:00]  and you're within the family, you got us.  What can I say?  On some site.  What?  Someone just emailed me these.  What?  It's the car.  I don't know.  Look at this site.  I don't know what this is.  Mark, don't you have work to do?  It's 20 minutes after.  Oh.  I don't know if I can put it off for later because it's crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Carla, we're sending you to Vegas. 
[01:07:30]  You'll have nothing to do with the family business.  Remember that scene?  Well, anyway, this is what happened.  We passed that part.  Right.  This is what happened.  This is how we perceived it.  I believe it's an accurate assessment of the situation, regardless of Rick's argument.  But can you at least see my side where it's like, all right, I'm in a bad position.  If I'm at on Jay.  No, no.  I can't see your side at all.  Jay's going to attack.  The listeners are going to attack.  And then you guys are probably going to jump in.  I'm saying that it is such a no-brainer that you shouldn't even consider it for a split second. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  It should instantly.  If someone approached me about playing a gag on Ope, the second that person left the room,  I would go to Ope and say, oh, this person wants to do this.  They said this, blah, blah, blah.  What are we going to do about it?  Right.  And that's what we do.  And Ope would do the same thing.  That's not even what happened.  It was three days later that they're like, hey, Rick, we've got to tell you something.  Three days into a seven-day gag on Ope and Anthony.  So you knew long before it wrapped up. 
[01:08:30]  You knew.  Well, they wanted to wrap it that day.  It doesn't matter.  You knew and you didn't tell us.  You knew, didn't tell us.  Because I know we could have pulled a fast one on him.  Absolutely.  And then it would have still had the same result.  It would have been an unbelievable prank, but we turned it around.  We would have came out on top.  All you had to do was give us a little info, be a little loyal to the family, and we could  have turned it around.  Bob Zini.  To Talia.  Who was it, Carlo? 
[01:09:00]  Who approached you?  Who approached you about Sonny?  You figured Sonny, didn't you, Carlo?  It was Bob Zini.  Okay.  Carlo, here's two tickets.  Here's a plane ticket to Vegas.  You're out of the family business.  Go out in the car.  Clemenza's waiting in the back seat with a piece of piano wire.  Your shoe's going to go through the window.  Hello, Carlo.  And Fish, also involved in the conspiracy. 
[01:09:30]  Could you get me off the hook for old times?  For old times' sake.  Can't do it, Sally.  Well, in fairness to Rick, there's a couple people that think Rick is in the right here.  Who?  Well, let's talk to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Bob.  How you doing?  Good.  I tell you, you guys are fantastic.  Yesterday was awesome.  Yeah, I got to stick up for Rick, man.  How?  Because you guys just don't like being on the fuzzy end of the stick. 
[01:10:00]  You know?  I mean, it was a great prank, and you guys said it was the first time you guys have ever  been pranked.  Yeah, but we didn't...  And you don't like it.  You don't like being on the fuzzy end of the stick.  We don't like when it's one of our own people.  If Rick wasn't involved, we'd have reacted the same way we did.  We'd have said, oh, my God, they got us.  Wow, good.  But to know that Rick was in the fold there, and he's involved in this show, personally,  ah.  Guys, you got to say it was awesome radio.  It was good radio.  It was awesome.  It was great radio, but we're not saying that. 
[01:10:30]  We're saying that the loyalty lies with the people in this program, period.  Period.  It's non-negotiable.  If it was another radio...  When you guys brought up the radio station, I had to agree with that.  But this was totally out of left field, and it had me going like crazy, and I thought  it was, you know, legit until the end.  Well, Bob, either way, it would have been, you know, good radio.  It would have been nice if we came out on top and we had that chance.  Yeah, but you guys only came out on top.  They laughed in our face.  They had T-shirts already made, and we looked silly. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  We looked silly.  I don't know if they were laughing.  You don't like...  They were laughing.  After you clocked Paul, everybody was laughing because you hit Paul.  Well...  Yeah, it was awesome radio, man.  You guys couldn't have done it better.  All right.  Fantastic.  Rick, thumbs up, man.  Thank you, Bob.  Well, see, people are thinking that I'm involved from the start.  I'm not.  It doesn't matter when you were involved, though.  It doesn't matter.  Totally done.  We had a chance to really pull one over on those guys, and we would be sitting here 
[01:11:30]  to this day with no one pulling a prank on us.  Right.  And we pulled some amazing pranks in our career.  Ray...  We've gotten everyone.  Rick is a tool.  Never trust a spick.  Oh, my God.  Don't have to bring race into it there, Ray.  My goodness.  Rudy, what's up?  Yeah, man.  He sold out.  Yeah.  It's a Fredo, man.  Fredo, you know?  Yeah.  I can do everything.  Fredo, do this.  Fredo, do that.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I can do things. 
[01:12:00]  I'm smart.  I can do things.  Now they got me managing some stupid farm figures.  I'm smart, Mike.  I'm smart.  I'm smart, Mike.  I was passed over.  I'm the older brother.  I'm smart.  You guys are great, man.  I love you.  All right, man.  Take care.  Thank you.  Well, Rick went against the show.  He went against the show.  John, real fast, because we want to move on.  Yeah, I guess just let me ask you this.  Yeah.  You're telling me, Opie, that you will never, ever pull a prank on Anthony, and Anthony 
[01:12:30]  will never, ever pull a prank on Opie?  You weren't listening to us.  Mm-hmm.  There may come a day that something is really good, and I can pull over on it, but it's  within the family.  Right.  There will never be an outside force trying to use me.  You hope we'll never conspire with Jay to do something to Anthony.  Absolutely not.  No.  Or vice versa.  No, we're not.  And in most cases, I would probably tell Anthony, you know, they've got something planned  for you.  Yeah.  Within the family, even.  All right.  Yeah, I don't want to hold it up too much, because I'm the one who wants to know about 
[01:13:00]  the car.  Okay.  Because I mean, because the crap Ant and I have been through over the years, and now these  guys are all part of this as well now.  We like to feel that nobody can come in to this program from the outside and pull one  over on us ever, ever, because we're all loyal to each other.  That's the way it is.  Right.  If someone pulls something over on us, it is because nobody inside the family that is  the Opie and Anthony show knew in any way, shape, or form before or during the event. 
[01:13:30]  No one should ever, ever know and not tell us.  And Rick?  You did.  I didn't tell.  You didn't tell.  That's enough.  That is enough right there.  Even though Cousin Jay...  Cousin Jay!  Jay is a fantastic guest on this show.  Has carte blanche to come in here whenever he wants, Paul whenever he wants.  But as far as being a part, a member of the Opie and Anthony show, yeah, we say, yeah, 
[01:14:00]  it's, you know, Jay is a part, he's part of the show.  And notice he hasn't said Billy and Paul once.  Ah, yeah.  How about Billy and Paul?  Well, that argument isn't as strong.  Because, yeah, Jay is closer to the show than Billy and Paul, but...  Let me just make that point, because if it was just Billy and Paul and a few other people,  then no, they're hung out to dry.  Oh, stop, dude.  Hung out to dry.  But because I know the tie that Jay has with you guys, I gotta sit there and go,  what the hell do I do?  I sit on my hands, what the hell do I do? 
[01:14:30]  You can't let a Hollywood star get the best of us.  You can't.  It's a no-brainer.  I'm serious, Rick.  It's a no-brainer.  You guys have turned on me with him before, so what am I expecting to happen?  So what...  He's feeling like Fredo, like we turned on him.  We passed him over as Don.  Rick, answer this honestly, okay?  I'm smart!  So let's say the events were different.  Okay.  You went, oh my God, I know that this is all a prank.  They're trying to get one on the guys, and you came to us and told us that. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  Do you honestly think Ant and I were going to go, why'd you tell us this was going to be great radio?  Oh, Rick, you wrecked it.  Why'd you tell us?  You honestly think we would tell us.  Or would we have said, oh my God, thank you so much for letting us in, and then we would  brainstorm.  I thought that something was fishy.  All right, let's all get together and see what we can pull on them.  At some point, yeah, you probably would have said, oh man, that's great, but okay, now  that we know, let's get him.  You probably...  I would have never said to you, Rick, why did you tell me?  Never!  No, I didn't say you wouldn't say, why did you tell me? 
[01:15:30]  You would have known.  But that was one of your concerns.  That was a great thing.  But that was one of your concerns.  It was.  You thought we were going to yell at you and go, why are you telling us this?  This is too good.  Shouldn't even be a question.  Shouldn't have been.  Shouldn't even be a question.  No.  No.  All right, so anyway.  So that's where that stood.  Right.  Regardless of how you feel about it, the rest of the people on this program feel that you  should have come to us and said something.  But put yourself in my position and something has gone down.  If I was, Rick, I swear to God, two seconds, as fast as I could carry myself, I'd have told us. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I would have.  Especially how intense that was, and we really weren't sure if it was fake or real for a while.  Hindsight is always 20 or something.  We never...  Come on, Rick.  It is.  That's not a hindsight thing.  It is.  At least admit it.  Come on.  At least admit it.  There are certain things that there's no hindsight on.  It's an instant decision that you make, and that's it.  There's not even...  There's no hindsight on something that you should decide like that.  If it was anybody else. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, no.  Kathy, what's going on?  I don't know.  You're beating up Rick.  It seems like you're taking it all too personally.  Well, we are.  I'll admit we are taking it personally.  We don't like when people get us.  Well, it doesn't feel good.  It's embarrassing, but I think you get it for the good of the show.  The good of the show?  What is this, morning radio?  Yeah, but it was great to listen to.  Well, who knows what would have come out if we knew and were able to turn it around and pull something on them. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not saying it might have ended up being a lousy radio.  It might have...  The way it turned out could have been the best thing as far as what it sounded like over these airwaves, which is fine.  But it doesn't matter.  But it doesn't matter.  You've got to admit, it wouldn't have been nearly as funny for the listeners...  That's not the issue.  ...to play the prank on them as it was to hear...  It doesn't matter.  You know what?  I'm not even going to admit that.  I have confidence in what Ant and I could come up with, and we would have come up with some.  Without a doubt. 
[01:17:30]  And the shock in their face when all of a sudden they realize that we...  It would have been funny for you, but for the listeners, I don't care whether they were embarrassed by it.  I don't care what you did to them.  I just thought it was funny.  All right.  The way it worked out.  That's all.  Well, I'm not going to deny that.  There was good radio.  That's not the point here.  No, no.  You've got to give me some credit.  Thanks, Kathy.  You threw a punch for the first time in years.  Credit.  Credit.  You think I felt good about punching someone in the face?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Well, part of it.  All right.  All right.  You got me there.  See, at least I can admit it.  All right.  We could argue this for eight years here.  All right.  Let's fast forward then.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  No, we didn't.  Ant, look at the time.  I'm not doing a radio.  No, I mean, this is the setup, though.  Right.  Yeah.  This is the setup, and part two's next, okay?  Okay.  The first Mike-looking line took me.  What?  All right.  We'll be back. 
[01:18:30]  And the story about Rick's car.  It's the O&A Show.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Russ, what's up?  Hey, you guys are being a bunch of pansies.  Why?  Because I got a good look on you, and just let it go.  Dude, are you totally missing the point here?  No, I'm not missing the point.  I'm not talking about it.  I'm not missing the point.  What's the point we're trying to make then?  Go ahead.  You explain the point that we were trying to make. 
[01:19:00]  Go ahead.  That he went above your head and didn't let you know what was going on.  Okay.  Is the point at all the outcome of the gag here?  No, I...  Is that it was good radio or bad radio or anything?  That we're being pansies because we got taken?  No.  We're not...  We're talking about people on the show telling us when somebody is trying to do something to us.  That's all. 
[01:19:30]  That's all this is about.  So you agree it was a good prank, though?  Yeah, we said that.  We said that a thousand times.  We said that a thousand times.  We patted them all on the back.  We said it to...  I went out to dinner with all of them.  You're a baby.  All right, Russ.  Hey.  You're being a baby, bud.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Russ.  All right.  Maybe a lot of...  I'll stick something in that chick's mouth to shut her up.  Maybe a lot of these people don't understand the world of radio.  I guess not.  I don't know.  There's a lot of people in this industry that are out for our heads.  They're missing the point, you know? 
[01:20:00]  We always have to be, you know, on guard for people trying to get us, trying to prank us, trying to get us.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Well, you know, regardless.  Because a lot of people are saying, hey, what are you talking about this for?  It happened months ago.  We were just trying to fill you in on what happened so we could tell you what happened after this.  Right.  The thing about Rick's car.  Right.  So about what?  Three weeks ago or so? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, about three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago, I guess.  You know what it was?  Yeah.  We find out that somebody went up to Rick's car.  And this was...  See, I don't want to say it in a way that I'm going to get him mad or anything.  Just say it at this point.  All right.  You already beat the hell out of the whole place.  It wasn't in front of your house, was it? 
[01:21:00]  Right?  Close enough.  Okay.  All right.  Well, anyway.  Took his car.  Wrapped it in newspaper.  Totally.  Like, there wasn't one piece of car left sticking out of the newspaper, but didn't get any tape on the car or anything.  Wrapped it up very nicely.  It was a great wrapping.  Yeah.  It really was.  Then took a pile of newspapers, put it on the hood, the car all wrapped up, and then put a fish on that pile of newspapers. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  And then took a ceramic...  A real fish, by the way.  Yeah, a real fish.  Yeah.  A ceramic horse head.  What kind of fish was it?  I'm not trying to make jokes.  I'm just curious.  I think it was like three feet long.  Yeah, it was huge.  And took a ceramic horse head.  And put it on the hood.  And a big black letters across the windshield that said Fredo.  Mark, you still work here? 
[01:22:00]  And a note.  A cryptic note.  Right.  Where all the letters were cut out of magazines and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was written out of magazines or something like that.  Right.  So, I'm trying to find it.  Yeah.  And these pictures ended up on the unofficial Opian Anthony website.  And Rick had no clue.  And when he found out, he completely lost it.  Here's the note.  Fredo Rick.  You're like our older brother, but don't ever take sides against the family again. 
[01:22:30]  ONA Flipmo Squad.  That's cool.  Signed it, I guess.  And there was a wow sticker on the fish.  Yeah, there's a wow sticker on the fish.  And the car just completely wrapped up.  Right.  Well, Rick, needless to say, freaked the F out.  Like, freaked out.  Thought that somebody had stalked him down or something and wrapped the car up. 
[01:23:00]  And he was very upset, wondering how they knew it was his car.  Just a whole bunch of things flashed in his mind like, oh, my God, there's a stalker or something.  Well, and in fairness to Rick, I will stick up for him.  His wife got really upset.  Okay.  Because she had...  She was the one that found it.  All right.  And, you know, that's...  And obviously, that's not cool.  We're not that sick and twisted around here.  And she got really upset because she really thought it was some psycho, you know, that was just taking it way too far, obviously.  And we knew nothing about this.  Well, listeners aren't like that. 
[01:23:30]  So I understand why Rick got so pissed.  Mm-hmm.  You know, when your wife or your girlfriend, you know, is that upset and really worried and thinking that someone really is out there stalking you.  Now, during the course of the day, we got certain information.  The day after, correct?  Yeah, the day after.  Now, Rick called me at home and stuff, and I swear, when you called me, I had no freedom.  We didn't know who did this, that it was an inside job.  I really did not know.  And that's the truth.  Didn't know.  And Rick was starting to think Psycho Mark was involved at some point. 
[01:24:00]  And Psycho Mark, you weren't involved, right?  Oh, yes, he was.  No, the best part is I had nothing to do with it.  Dude, you were already ratted out.  Don't worry about it.  Dude, he's so convinced that I had something to do with it, which is the best part.  You were already ratted out.  Rick, I didn't do anything.  You're the worst liar.  Don't worry.  I took so much joy in this because you thought I did it.  And I had nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  I knew about it, but I did not do it.  Oh, mm. 
[01:24:30]  See?  See?  Stop.  Wait, that's why you were already ratted out.  I knew about it two weeks before it happened.  See?  Oh.  Look at that.  See, that's where I have a problem.  See, that's where the problem is.  I definitely have a problem with Psycho Mark because of that, too.  Why?  Now, wait.  If it's a payback, or...  Yeah, but they should have let us know.  But guess what?  The prank wasn't pulled on Psycho Mark.  Well, Psycho Mark didn't know about the Jay Moore airsick prank. 
[01:25:00]  Now, this was a retribution for that.  That's why this person did this to Rick's car.  Right.  So now Rick thinks it's just some psychopath stalking him and tampering with his personal goods and stuff like that.  Freaks out.  Right.  And why do I think that?  Because of all the weird emails we always have.  Right, right.  Now, of course, he should think that.  You should definitely think that.  And we had this discussion before we even started the show that day about all the weirdos out there.  We talked about Hope's problem and your possible problem that was floating out. 
[01:25:30]  Sure.  Now, this is where it gets really weird, though, because, like, we all agree we weren't going to talk about it on the air.  Exactly.  Because we really, you know, thought it was a lunatic.  So you don't want to talk about it on the air to give the person any publicity, to maybe entice that person to do something else or something.  It's just best left off the air, which, of course, we didn't talk about it on the air until...  We found out it was an inside job.  We found out it was an inside job.  It was retribution for what you had done. 
[01:26:00]  So even though you did not know yet, we then knew, and we're going to present it on the air.  All right.  See, that's where I had a serious problem.  Of course you did, because you still were under the impression that it was a lunatic when we brought it out on the air.  No, no, no.  So your impression is, oh, my God, they're talking about this, and it's a lunatic.  Our impression is, we know who did it.  That's why we're talking about it.  Well, you know what?  You guys, I wasn't informed.  Why?  So to me, it's still a problem, especially, hold on, especially since we had an agreement that it was not to be talked about. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  I told my wife, I called her, I said, look, I talked to the guys.  They said they weren't going to talk about it.  So now she can just relax and not worry about it.  So now you think we should have come up to you and said, Rick, it's a gag off the air,  so that way we could spring it spontaneously on the air, that it was a joke.  It wouldn't have worked that way.  The only way it works is on the air, you freaking the F out thinking we're talking about it,  because you think it's a crazed listener or something.  And when we did bring it up on the air, we made it apparent very early on that we knew exactly what was going on, 
[01:27:00]  and it wasn't a psychopath.  Well, Rick lost his mother effing mind.  He ran around this place destroying a property.  Pretty much everything in his sight.  It was like a tornado.  They still haven't fixed the bathroom door on the night.  The hardware is still up on the shelf by the soap.  It was like the Tasmanian devil.  Yeah, just spinning around with stuff flying.  We were sitting in the office at one point.  You just heard like things banging and blowing up. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know what he was saying.  But, see, your problem, obviously, was that you thought it was a nut.  We knew it wasn't.  It wasn't even that.  It got to the point where we had an agreement before we went on the air that day not to talk about it.  That was the problem.  That was my big problem.  But then when we knew it, it was an inside dog.  And if you could have just gone over things quickly beforehand, just to say, okay, look, it wasn't a wacko.  We'll tell you all about it. 
[01:28:00]  No, no, no, no.  You know why?  No, no, no.  You know why?  Because I'm still thinking of the person who doesn't know anything.  And who would that person be?  When we made the agreement with you, Rick, we truly did not have all the fun.  I understand, but who would that person be that still would not know anything?  What?  Who would the person be who was involved and still did not know anything?  You, but no, no, no, no.  Oh, Linda.  Exactly.  No, we made it very...  But the way we were talking about it, we instantly made it known that it was an inside job. 
[01:28:30]  I think minutes of talking about it on the air, it was obvious to everyone it was a gag and that it was an inside job.  We didn't just start talking about it and make it still seem like it was a crazy listener or something.  No, not at all.  We were saying that we know who did it and blah, blah, blah.  But still, my whole problem for Wiggin' Out is we had an agreement and you guys broke it.  The agreement was based on the fact that you didn't know who it was.  Yeah, and the agreement was...  And why was that?  Because my wife was freaked out. 
[01:29:00]  Because it was a joke.  It was a gag.  Yeah, but who the hell knew it?  Not you.  That's why it worked.  Only you guys.  Yeah, and who knew about the airsick general thing?  You did.  We didn't know.  We didn't know.  And it was retribution for that.  I mean, the prank you were involved with with the airsick guys got so serious, I punched someone.  So what's your point?  That's how pranks work.  People don't know and then you spring it on.  My point is we had an agreement beforehand and it should have been stuck to. 
[01:29:30]  Even if it's just a, look, we're about to talk about this.  You know, you might want to call Linda, let her know that, you know, we're going to talk about this and she can find out everything.  She doesn't have to worry.  Nope.  The rules changed midway when we found out who did it and that it was an inside job.  And that's when the rules changed.  Well, I've got to protect, you know, my wife and what she feels.  Well, that's why we went on the air and didn't.  You don't have a problem with that, right?  That's why we went on the air and didn't make it seem like it was a listener. 
[01:30:00]  But that's why I didn't want it on the air.  But, Rick, you can't tell somebody about a prank off the air and then get on the air and it's not spontaneous.  Right.  We don't do fake radio.  But you guys wanted me to tell you about the prank that was being pulled on you, so.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  That's why it got pulled on you.  Exactly.  Oh.  That's why it was pulled on you.  Don't you get it?  It's called retribution.  It's called retribution, yes.  Yeah.  If you were part of the family, we would have never done that to you.  And we didn't do it.  And believe me, we didn't know about it before it happened.  We only found out after it happened. 
[01:30:30]  And you know why else I didn't want it on?  Because of the people who were involved had nothing to do with this show.  There were certain people involved that nobody knows.  Right.  That live in that area.  And that's the last thing I want is to, you know, point out directions as to where the hell I live.  Well, somebody took the initiative to payback, to do a little payback.  You had the police involved.  Keith.  Yeah.  What's up? 
[01:31:00]  How are you, fellas?  You had poor Keith calling me five times that night to apologize and beg not to say anything because he didn't want to lose his job.  I called because I felt that with Linda, I didn't want her to worry about it.  I honestly didn't think that when the prank was pulled that you were going to get upset about it.  That's why I called Linda and I called you to apologize because I felt bad.  Right.  And what did I tell you?  I told him, I go, dude, I applaud the prank.  I go, I think it's hilarious. 
[01:31:30]  I go, but not in front of my house.  Right.  If it was done, if my car was in the parking garage and the guy pulls up and the top is down and everything's covered with paper,  I'm laughing my ass off because I don't have to worry about, you know, anything being done in front of where I live.  That was my big problem and that's what I was upset about.  Steve from the city, hey, Rick's gone soft since getting married.  That's what $700 pots will do to you.  I remember that. 
[01:32:00]  Well, I have to say that I didn't know that you lived right there.  I knew that you commuted from the train station and it took me two days driving around with that dead fish in the back of my truck looking for your car.  I looked in the train station.  I drove through every parking garage in the area before I finally started going street to street looking for your car with this dead fish in the back of my truck.  I believe we have found the obsessed fan.  Yeah.  The hell is wrong with you, Keith? 
[01:32:30]  And, you know, it was payback because I felt that the family is the family.  And although I'm not an immediate family.  Well, well, Keith, you're not part of the family.  Right.  I will have to say that.  I agree.  You're not even a cousin.  I'm a guest on the show.  And I felt that it would be good radio.  It would be a good prank.  Mm-hmm.  And as, you know, somebody who's, you know.  Now, Rick, here's where this all comes into play. 
[01:33:00]  Let's say that the prank with Jay never happened.  Or, on the other hand, let's say the prank happened but you did come to Opie and I and we tried to work something out.  But you did come with us with the information.  The second I found out that Keith was responsible for your car, I would have come right to you and said, Rick, this is the deal.  But then you went right on the air with it.  No.  I would have come to you off the air and said, Rick, I know who did this.  Don't worry about it. 
[01:33:30]  Here's the deal.  Well, but since what happened happened with Jay, why am I going to say anything?  Well, how do I know that?  Because that's how we work.  That's how Opie knows it.  Yeah, we don't.  I could just look at it, Ann, and no, he's not going to do that to me.  Ben knows it.  That's the agreement you two have with each other.  None of us.  No, that's the agreement this whole program has.  No, we're allowing it all you guys.  We are that tight.  You're saying that now.  The whole show is.  The whole show is.  That's what we're saying.  Right.  Yeah.  That's the point. 
[01:34:00]  So he was freaking for, like, days.  We couldn't even talk about it.  I mean, we couldn't even mention it.  Even though he knew at that point it was a gag against him, we didn't know up until after it was done.  The day we mentioned it on the air, that's when we found out.  And believe me, one of the reasons for bringing it up on the air was so you wouldn't go home still thinking you had a nut.  But we figured we'd do it on the air and let you know that it was indeed a prank.  And that was it.  But for a week straight, oh, my God, walking on eggshells. 
[01:34:30]  You won't even mention the car.  Are people replacing things around the...  What happened to the trophy?  Oh, my God.  Fell, all right.  Off of what?  The top of the building?  150.  Yeah, I mean, the old N.E.W. staff worked hard to get that trophy.  I hit a triple to bring in...  So are we finally done with all this? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, that's what happened with Rick's car.  And he was just flipping.  So that's it.  Now, are we all on the same page?  I think so.  Are we all on the same page?  We know that if we're ever approached by anyone else for any gags, we tell the other people.  But on that note also, it wasn't even that good of a prank.  I don't know.  That was pretty good.  That was good radio.  Freaked you out.  Freaked you out.  We got some good audio.  No, it was good stuff.  That part.  But the prank itself, it's like...  It would have been better if you allowed the pictures to stay up on the unofficial website. 
[01:35:30]  You should at least let that one picture up there for a day.  No one knows what kind of car it is.  The close one?  No one knows what kind of car it is.  Well, we haven't mentioned it.  We haven't mentioned the car.  Oh, my God.  You can plunk down any car.  We haven't mentioned it.  We'll probably know it.  Whatever.  But it doesn't...  It's part of the O&A trivia.  It doesn't show it in that picture.  That's what I'm trying to say.  It could be any car under that newspaper, the picture I'm looking at. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, whoever knows, knows.  I mean, but...  Yeah.  You can't tell from that picture.  But we didn't even mention the car once during this whole break.  Anyway, so it's simple.  It's us against the world.  And when I say us, it's not Ant and I.  It's us.  We've all been working our balls off on this radio show.  Even Stinky's part of us now.  Even that idiot over there is.  Even though I've got problems with him.  F-you. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Well, that's it.  And that's the end of the story.  There you go.  You see, it wasn't even that good of a prank.  It was a good idea, but it just wasn't done in a good way.  No, it was good.  Like I said, if it was done...  Confrontational radio is very good.  I'm just saying the prank itself.  And I told Keith, I said, it was a great job.  The fact that you were able to do all that stuff, that's fine.  I didn't have a problem with that.  And he knows what the problem was.  But if it was done in the car garage, and, you know, somebody parked downstairs with a video camera, 
[01:37:00]  and when I come up...  It was good payback.  But the fact of the matter is, you had two teenage girls who had nothing to do with anything  getting grilled by the cops over it.  All right.  You had another lady who lives down that street being visited by the cops at all hours of the night to talk about it.  Like I said, we had nothing to do with that.  Those people weren't even involved.  But it was good radio.  Yeah.  On many levels.  And good payback.  I expected more. 
[01:37:30]  You're absolutely right, Rick.  Everyone knows.  That's all that's coming in on the instant feedback.  Well, we share too much on this show.  Everyone knows where Spaz lives.  A lot of people know where I live now.  They all know our names.  Oh, well.  So.  All right.  We've got to take a break and regroup.  All right.  Are we all on the same page, though?  We're all a family now again.  We take care of this.  Everyone's loyal.  Stinky. 
[01:38:00]  You loyal?  Yes, I'm very loyal.  There you go.  Stinky, someone comes to you on the outside and they have an idea for a prank against the show.  What are you going to do?  Oh, hide it from you guys.  All right.  You're fired.  Wrap your bicycle up.  Wrap a skate.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  We'll come back, okay?  Right.  Do we have info on the next road show?  No?  Nothing confirmed, but we did find a place.  We did find a place last night.  Oh, I thought we were going to be.  But as soon as we get the paper in the next day or so, we should. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, all right.  I guess we could say this much.  We're hoping to throw a huge summer kickoff party next Thursday.  We really are hoping.  I thought we could talk about it, but we're waiting for people to sign stuff and things  like that.  It's not that close yet.  It's not that close yet, okay?  Yeah, man.  See, everyone knows what car.  There's my car.  What?  Yeah, but.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Dude, there are a lot of those around and easily lost. 
[01:39:00]  Not when I'm at a traffic light and people drive right up to me and start honking just  to say hi.  Well, turn the Riffy Martin music down.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  O.P. and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-0-1-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  Yes.  I love my Rockaway Bedding bed.  Rockaway Bedding has 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey.  Brand-name mattresses, Sealy Posturepedic, Serta Perfect Sleeper, and Simmons Beautyrest  have prices up to 65% below with department store regular prices. 
[01:39:30]  Our own spaz has joined the wonderful family of people that have a Rockaway Bedding bed.  He gropes Erica on a Rockaway Bedding mattress.  I want to know how he's sleeping.  We should get him in here.  Rockaway Bedding, the only major area mattress store that offers you a free steel bed frame,  free delivery, free complete removal of your old bedding.

They didn't get bunk beds, did they? 
[01:40:00]  Anything you need, Rockaway Bedding is the store to go to.  Spaz, Spaz, how are you sleeping on your Rockaway Bedding bed?  Oh, great.  It's great, isn't it?  Much better than the two mattresses I had before.  What size did you get?  Uh, I got a queen.  A queen?  What, are you stupid?  Why didn't you get the king?  It would have got you a king.  You get the big one.  You're sleeping with Erica.  That way Erica could stay way over on one side.  I get away from your mauling.  I would never have gotten the king.  The queen bed is too small for two people. 
[01:40:30]  I wanted the queen so if she tries to get away while I'm mauling her, she can't go that far.  Right.  Within arm's reach.  So you maul her in a Rockaway Bedding mattress now?  Yeah.  Uh, God.  Too much information.  Spaz is, uh, yeah, Spaz is now staining a Rockaway Bedding mattress.  Rockaway Bedding fastest growing chain of mattress stores in New York and New Jersey.

Smack my bitch up.  Send this out to Sean Connery.  Yeah, they want to, uh, smack my bitch up.  I guess they, they don't want him knighted. 
[01:41:30]  They want to strip him of his knighthood.  Yeah, I guess it's a big story in, what, the post today?  Yeah, even after he's, uh, let's see, yeah, he's supposed to be knighted by the Queen, but they want to strip him of it because, uh, well, for years it seems he's just been smacking his bitches up.  Oh.  Oh.  What's wrong with that? 
[01:42:00]  Come here.  Come here, you lovely little thing.  Come here.  Come here, give us a kiss.  You stupid bitch.  God, Sean Connery is, uh...  Well, it's quite an honor to be knighted, and they, they feel like they shouldn't, uh, give it to someone that beats his women.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, there was controversy with him, uh, back in, I guess, the early 90s.  He was, uh, on an interview with Barbara Walters and said, uh, he could imagine hitting his wife. 
[01:42:30]  Two years after he said that he tried to justify the statement in Vanity Fair.  Well, let's be honest, I think we could all imagine hitting our woman.  Oh, my God!  There are times you really do want to do it, but there's something that tells you in the back of your head that it's not a good thing to do.  Well, he tried to explain it by saying, uh...  Sometimes you do get pissed, and you imagine a lot of, uh, a lot of things, Anthony.  He says to Barbara Walters, uh, about the Barbara Walters interview in Vanity Fair, 
[01:43:00]  where I was really saying that to slap a woman is not the clueless thing you can do to her.  It's much more cruel to psychologically damage someone.  Isn't that right, you slut?  I'm gonna take a crowbar and smash you in the face, man.  I told her to shit.  Well, what?  In the chair.  Oh, oh, oh, sit. 
[01:43:30]  Sit down.  You say sit very, uh, unusual.  I have this speech impediment with my essence.  I sit.  Come here.  You're lovely.  Now sit.  Sit down.  Before I smack you.  Bloody bitch.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a great little, little, uh, I guess, story on what happened years ago.  Uh, his wife at the time, the sultry Diana Salento, uh, became friendly with a hotel waiter. 
[01:44:00]  The actor ordered her to go to the hotel suite.  Go back to the suite and sit there and wait for me.  You're saying sit, right?  Shit.  That's what I said.  Sit.  Sit in the chair.  Yeah.  Diana Salento, she became friendly with a hotel waiter.  So I said, go back to the hotel and shit and wait for me.  Uh, she went there.  Uh, the actor returned to the suite and allegedly, uh, allegedly, allegedly delivered a brutal beating. 
[01:44:30]  Connery hit her, not with the flat of his hands, but with fists full between the eyes.  Jesus.  Another blow follows the first, and then another and another, until Salento falls back onto the bed.  Her face a bloody mess.  The next morning, the face of one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation was ballooned up like a puffer fish.  He beat the crap out of her.  What a douche. 
[01:45:00]  I thought, talk to a waiter?  Now get back to the suite and sit there and wait for me.  You just don't know.  I'm losing my hair and it pisses me off.  That's what it is.  Going bald.  Hands falling in my face, you bitch.  You're bald.  God damn. 
[01:45:30]  Boy, that sounds pretty brutal.  In a face like that.  My women, I like to actually hit them with phone books about the body so they can't tell.  I had a good idea.  Remember Ike Turner?  Yeah, yeah.  From Ike and Tina Turner?  Yeah.  He will beat her with a car antenna on her body so she can perform later that night and not be all posed up.  See, Sean Connery doesn't know the final odds of beating your woman. 
[01:46:00]  You've got to punch her internal organs like the universe, allegedly.  But I like the hotel room thing.  That's good.  I and Mike likes the hotel because then he doesn't have to clean the blood up off his own floor, off his own house.  Well, what does Sean Connery think of Mike Tyson's advice there?  Mike, just go sit in a corner.  Sit, right?  That's what I say.  Why do you keep questioning me?  I just want to make sure.  Of course, I'm saying sit.  Sit down.  I don't want them dumping out of the show if you're really saying sit. 
[01:46:30]  Sit down, yeah.  Sit.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Like in a chair.  It's that speech impediment, right?  That's what it is.  Something with my S's.  I have a hard time saying sit.  I like that O.J. Simpson.  A good man.  What's wrong with that?  Sometimes you just imagine that.  You have to sit and concentrate.  Sit down in a chair and concentrate.  Sometimes I just like to sit down on the toilet. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  Yeah, so I guess they're going to try to take his knighthood away.  I don't think it means the same thing these days, people.  What's the big deal?  Didn't Paul McCartney get knighted?  Don't see him on armor on top of a horse jousting or anything.  Maybe it meant something in the old days.  Anthony Hopkins, right?  Yeah.  He's a knight now.  Sir Anthony Hopkins knighted.  Yeah, now send them all into battle.  Like the old days with big maces and swords. 
[01:47:30]  Did you see that?  Get over here.  Ow.  You chopped my hair off.  It's only a flesh wound.  That's great.  The queen will give me a sword.  And I'll beat my wife over the head with it.  Bitch.  Sit here.  Sit.  Paul McCartney going into battle.  Swinging a big battle axe.  Please.  What does the knighthood mean anymore?  Swinging the spike ball. 
[01:48:00]  You know what the old knights used to do?  Lock up that snatch.  Remember that?  That's not abusive.  He used to put those chastity belts on them when they went into battle.  So the farm workers and stuff couldn't come by and bang them.  Well, then maybe Sean Connery should be knighted.  It's chivalry.  Shut up.  Get back to the suite.  Get back to the suite, you bitch.  And sit there and wait for me. 
[01:48:30]  I hit you with my knight sword and a big mace and that big hammer from Braveheart.  Remember that big hammer they came to the guy's head in?  I could smack my bitch up with that one.  Shut up.  Go with your waiter, friend, you whore.  Wait for me there all bloody, then I'll slam my yam bag against your ass.  I'll be laughing your balls off.  Sitting on stage.  In a stool. 
[01:49:00]  Sitting.  That's what I said.  Why do you keep correcting me?  I just want to make sure.  Well, thank you, Sean Connery, for stopping by today.  Elton John's a knight.  Jesus Christ.  He's going to go into battle with a dildo.  Big dildo.  He should be a dame.  Right?  Elizabeth Taylor became a dame.  Did you see her staggering up to the queen?  She was claiming in the paper that she's not old yet.  And the people still call her, you know, one of the most beautiful women.  She always makes the issue of, like, people's most beautiful women. 
[01:49:30]  Huh.  Honestly, shouldn't the most beautiful women be based on looks?  Has that gotten so politically correct now you can't even say?  See, when you're basing something on beauty, it doesn't matter if they've got a brain in their head or not,  or if they've been around, or it's green legends.  Yeah, it's time to use the past tense.  It should be.  Yeah, maybe she was beautiful years ago when Mickey Rooney was banging her.  But now?  You should judge that on the fact that would you like to rip her clothes off and see her stand in there naked? 
[01:50:00]  Picture that one.  I'd rather see the queen mum.  That big head of black hair all dyed on her head in the big patch of gray down there.  Oh, dude, come on, man.  Yes.  I don't need that visual.  I'm going to beat that bitch out in jar.  Come here, Elton.  Yes!  You're like a bitch talking to that waiter.  Get back to the sweet shit and wait for me!  Oh, look who's on the line. 
[01:50:30]  Nikki from We Deliver Caggers.  What does she want?  Nikki!  Hello, lovely Nikki.  I'm only calling because I'm sorry.  You know, Nikki, I would love to come over your house and smack the face.  I'm sorry to say thank you, even though I got mad.  Nikki, can I?  You wait, you...  Shut up, you bitch!  Wait in the hotel suite, sit there, and I'll come over and beat you.  Oh, that's a good thing, Sean doesn't know my address.  Yeah, tell me about the task cam. 
[01:51:00]  I'm very interested.  Shut up, Paul!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Tutank, twat!  All right, fine.  Fine, you're obviously still pissed about yesterday.  Have you seen...  Are you a big James Bond fan?  Do you remember 007?  I got $100,000, and I just wanted you to know I sold the task cam.  Thanks for the extra time.  That's what I'm saying.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Boy, when you talk to her, you kind of agree with Sean Connors. 
[01:51:30]  I'll stick a gold finger in there.  Old gold fist.  Money penny.  Money penny, get over here.  Sit there, and let me smack you.  I like my martinis like I like my women shaking.  And then punch.  Shaking nuts there.  Q, what kind of inventions do you have for me today?  Something I can remotely beat my wife from miles away? 
[01:52:00]  Just with a push of a button?  Or an ejector sheet?  So she can sit there, and I can eject her right out of the car?  Q, suck it.  Wait, give me a pen.  Wait, we still have Sean in here.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  Quick, go. 
[01:52:30]  Write faster, Opie.  Sorry.  I'm reading.  Money penny.  Look what I did to you again.  Again.  Oh.  All right.  All right, Nicky.  Very good.  I'm over here now.  This sounds funny. 
[01:53:00]  Butt sex.  Yeah, butt sex.  All right, do we have to take a break?  Gary, could you wait before you give your 90210 review from yesterday?  Huh?  All right, hold on.  We're going to take a quick break.  I know.  We'll play for him after the spot.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, 90210. 
[01:53:30]  Okay.  Gary from upstairs is going to give us his review on the final episode of 90210.  Rock.  Instead of watching the Nick game with Carolyn and getting banged at halftime, he had to  go home and watch 90210.  Am I lying?  Hey, hey.  Am I lying?  He's a bitch.  Get over here.  I'll smack you.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way.  Stay there.  1027 WNEW.  Our system is now over. 
[01:54:00]  Until you have any self-respect, aren't you embarrassed to be self or your family?  Hopefully he has asked me.  You live human slime!  1027 WNEW.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  In the studio, Gary from upstairs.  Yeah.  He's pretty much in charge of the sales force here at WNEW.  And we also found out that he's a pussy whip.  You said it yesterday, not me. 
[01:54:30]  Of course, Gary was on the show yesterday, Anthony.  Yeah.  He had to rush home to watch the final episode of 90210.  Yeah, we were talking to him toward the end of the show, and he said, I gotta go.  Yeah.  Gotta watch the final episode.  And it wasn't even him that has to watch it.  His chick is gonna watch it, but he has to sit there with her and watch it.  With her.  She made you watch it, right?  I wouldn't watch that.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't watch it, but you did. 
[01:55:00]  Because you don't have two TVs, obviously.  I saw David marrying Donna, so that was the only thing I saw.  Oh, no.  You watched.  Is that how the show ended?  And Kelly with Dylan.  Aw.  But that dish bag, Brandon, never showed up.  Were you disappointed?  You're expecting him to show up?  Oh, I was hoping Brandon would make an appearance.  Hey!  The guy that's been on the show for, uh... 
[01:55:30]  So you watch every week?  I don't watch that.  Oh, sure.  Listen, he knows everything about it.  Yeah, but I...  I thought they canceled that show years ago.  I know.  I really can't stay too long.  I got an aerobics class.  You're lying, aren't you?  Are you lying?  No.  What kind of aerobics are you doing tonight?  Do you have a little step aerobics?  No, not step aerobics.  How the hell are people, potential clients, supposed to come to the table and bargain with you?  They'll come here because they'll think he's a pushover.  So, what type of aerobics? 
[01:56:00]  Water aerobics?  No, regular.  You mean like...  Some of that kickboxing stuff?  Synchronize the swimming?  You do some of that Thai bow?  No, just regular aerobics.  Thai bow.  Yeah?  With your girlfriend?  With the girlfriend?  Yeah, by myself.  You're lying, man.  Guys don't do aerobic classes by themselves.  I'm sorry.  Get out of here.  I'm sure there are guys out there that go with their girlfriend or wife, but if you have  the choice, you don't go, you know, pick up an aerobics class.  It's just for coordination.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's all.  Your girlfriend's on the line. 
[01:56:30]  Is she going to...  She's tough.  Is she going to kill us today?  I don't know.  You're picking on me.  Is Gary there?  Elizabeth.  Hi.  Hey.  Let's hope you're an athlete.  We got you on the air, so don't curse.  You can say whatever you want besides that.  Oh, because I needed him to bring something home.  What?  Just what he brought home last month.  The same brand.  What?  Have to go out and buy some feminine stuff?  Yeah.  I just need the same brand, but I really need them tonight. 
[01:57:00]  So could you just tell him?  Because they told me that he wasn't in his office, that he may have left, and then they  transferred me downstairs.  Well, he's right here.  What did you say before?  So you go out and buy...  Who is it?  It's Opie and Anthony, and Gary's in the studio with us, Elizabeth.  But I'm...  Oops.  Well, I'm sorry.  He doesn't have to bring that home.  Well, he has to bring it home, but don't talk about it.  Now, Elizabeth, did Gary enjoy the final episode of 90210?  He always makes me watch that. 
[01:57:30]  Come on, you're making me look bad.  But he's either that or Ally McBeal.  Get out of here.  Any guy that could sit through an episode of Ally McBeal, I swear to God, you would have  to be gay.  No, he's not.  He loves Ally.  He loves Ally.  You like Ally McBeal, Gary?  He's too skinny.  I think he has a crush on the Asian one.  Oh.  Well, we all do. 
[01:58:00]  So you sat and you got home in time, you're all excited and sat there.  Well, yeah, he made me sit there and watch the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then you also watched the last half hour of Nick Dean.  Yeah, well, I made you watch that.  Yeah, Dan Marley killed us last night.  Does he buy feminine hygiene products for you?  Well, I need him to do it.  You know, when he has to.  Would you go into the store with a big box of maybe Tampax or something? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah?  Come on.  There's nothing wrong with being sensitive.  He's very sensitive.  He's really a great guy.  You know?  Hey!  This macho stuff.  Hey!  Gary, Eddie on line eight wants to know if you have a sundress on.  Eddie, no, he's not wearing a sundress today.  What are people saying about him?  Oh, he's getting killed.  Oh, I better not.  He's going to get really mad at me.  Uh, Tex on line two says, doesn't Gary have a line dancing class to get to Tex?  Oh, come on.  He's really a good guy.  He likes to golf.  That's a guy thing. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, sure.  Has he bought you $700 pots yet?  $700 pots?  Nobody would do that.  Well, Rick, uh, yeah, whatever.  Yeah, so, but if you can just have him come home as soon as possible.  All right.  Yeah, he looks like he's ready to live.  Listen, I could do the other stuff.  You know, I could not come home.  I could, uh, you know, not help with the dishes.  All the other stuff, if that's what you'd like.  Oh, is that what you do, too?  Yeah?  You do the dishes and stuff.  Oh, don't get mad at me. 
[01:59:30]  If you don't want me to help out.  Oh, you're going to ruin the whole night.  Gary, what you got to do, lead with your left.  Oh, no, really, honey.  I don't mean it.  Yeah, right.  Steve on line one wants to know if Gary has a Kathy Lee CD yet.  He's always using mine.  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  All right.  Well, he's on his way.  Yeah, he's coming up.  What's on the TV tonight?  Let me see.  It's Thursday.  Oh, he likes Friends. 
[02:00:00]  No, I don't like Friends.  I like watching Friends, Gary.  I watch Popular.  Popular?  No, I won't let him watch that.  Teenage girls look good in that show.  That might not be all that bad.  I've got to agree with Gary on that one.  Nothing wrong with Teenage Muff.  Yeah, no, I don't like him looking at Teenage Girls.  Oh, right, Charmed.  Charmed.  Charmed.  It's that one, yeah?  All right.  All right, so, like, I'm going to go now, but if he could pick that up for me, I'd appreciate it. 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to kill you when I go.  All right.  All right, Elizabeth.  Uh-oh.  The lovely Elizabeth.  I said, give it to her.  Give me my U-Haul.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Um, Gary, Mike on line nine wants to play What's in Gary's Pants.  What's it?  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, is Gary going to play What's in My Pants a lot?  He's a homo.  All right, thank you, Mike.  Vaginas.  I'm not calling, asking What's in My Pants, but Mike? 
[02:01:00]  Vaginas.  I hope I don't have to explain that to you, Gary.  He's assuming you're a woman.  Oh.  Bobby, what's going on?  Gary, you big pussy.  Hey, do you know Gay Marco?  Because he might be your sex partner.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  He missed the whole Knick game, practically.  Yeah, that's a man's sport.  So what's on the Lifetime channel tonight, Gary?  I don't know.  You want me to tell you?  I have no clue. 
[02:01:30]  Let's go to that.  I usually watch that, but the Chicago Hope.  Reruns.  Let's go to Dennis.  Dennis.  Hey.  Hey.  What's going on?  How are you?  I want to know if Gary's going to earn his Red Wings tonight.  You know, it's that time of the month.  You know, you've got to earn those every once in a while.  Yeah, I think your girlfriend shared a little too much today.  I think so.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Syndication, huh?  Yeah.  Tonight on Lifetime, just for Gary, a special movie with Marky Post and Linda Carter. 
[02:02:00]  As two women wondering if they're more womanly than Gary.  Hey, Frank.  Hey.  How you doing, buddy?  Great.  I just want to know, does Gary sit to pee?  Thank you, Frank.  Take care, guys.  All these guys worried about that man.  All right.  And then you've got Dan.  He wants to know if Liz borrows your tampons, Gary.  How many guys watched the show last night that listened to the opening? 
[02:02:30]  90210?  I don't think there's any guy out there brave enough to admit it.  Gary, boxer's brief or a thong.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Well, people want to know.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to know.  What's up, precious?  Anthony, Gary.  Gary, I just got to ask you.  Is that feminine hygiene product for you or your girlfriend?  Because anybody who watches Beverly Hills 90210, whatever the hell that show is, I mean, are you pee-whipped or are you just complete homo? 
[02:03:00]  Not a homo.  Listeners chiming in.  Boy, oh, boy.  All right.  What a brutal bunch this is.  I mean, just because you're sitting there and watching a show.  Our listeners know how to read.  You calm down and you sell this show.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Gary, you want to be a lesbian for a day?  You got a new nickname for Gary is Bitch Boy.  Bitch Boy.  Did she let you first do the dishes before you get to your shows? 
[02:03:30]  Before you get to your cereals?  Yeah.  Watching the dishes real quick, hurrying.  Oh, turn the volume up.  I'm going to miss the beginning.  Well, Bob saw 90210 last night.  Bob?  Hello.  You calling from the village?  No, not exactly.  I didn't wash the dishes last night, but I watched 90210.  You did?  I'll tell you why.  And I haven't watched it for years, but I just had to get one last shot of Donna Martin's  fun bags before they went off the air. 
[02:04:00]  I don't even know who Donna Martin is.  She's like Tori Spelling.  Wait, she has the worst boob job in the history of boob jobs.  Yeah, but they're huge.  Looks like she's got a divot between her boobs.  There's nothing natural looking about those things at all.  All she is is one big set of boobs on top of, like, some little skinny body.  On top of an alien body.  An alien face, we should say.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Well, anyway, the other one's not so bad either.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  You think Tori Spelling's hot in?  Oh, no.  Not at all. 
[02:04:30]  And it just got worse as time went on.  And the boobs don't help.  Yeah.  It's like the worst boob job.  They're all stretched out.  And like I said, her breastbone, where it sticks out, there's this big divot there.  I know, I know.  Like they put too much in.  I'm sure her career will flourish after this.  Hey, Wendy's going to stick up for Gary.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Oh, her name must not be Wendy.  She didn't answer to it.  All right.  Danny, what's going on? 
[02:05:00]  What's up?  I think Gary has a Hitler mustache.  What is he?  Gay?  What is he taking the rear end?  Hey, what's your problem?  How do you know about that?  You're gay ass.  How do you know about that?  All right, Danny.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Spit or swallow, Gary.  Spit or swallow.  What a little thing.  I can't believe you're sitting here and taking this.  It's just going to get worse, you know.  Mike, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  I've got a question for Gary.  I wanted to know if he's on the same cycle his girlfriend is. 
[02:05:30]  Same period.  What brand do you use, by the way?  You're killing me.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  This is the best one from the instant feedback, Steve from the city.  Gary is, like, in charge of the whole sales force, pretty much, here at WNAW.  Steve writes, how can Gary sell airtime if he can't even sell watching the Knicks game?  Oh.  You can't even convince your girlfriend to watch the Knicks game.  How the hell are you going to convince people to buy this show? 
[02:06:00]  Bravo to Steve.  Larry, line of the day.  Do you promise him you'll do the dishes for us?  Go buy your pots.  Let's go to J.D. real fast.  J.D.  Hey.  Hey, J.D.  Yeah, a little bit of advice for Gary?  Yeah.  You can swim in the Red River, but never drink from it.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you're just getting nasty.  Uh, T.J.  Yo.  Hey.  Oh, and hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I've been watching 90210 for the whole ten years it was on.  Okay.  All right.  And you had to watch it last night because it's the end of an era.  Sure.  You had to watch the last one.  Yeah, it was lousy, though, right?  Yeah, it wasn't that great, but, you know, it's the last time you're ever going to see it.  Did your boyfriend like it?  No, he loved it.  Yeah?  Actually, my wife, like, she was crying on the couch.  What's his name?  Michelle.  Michael? 
[02:07:00]  I don't think I...  Come on, you guys are great.  You had to watch the show, though.  All right, T.J., thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Later.  I don't think...  God, who cares about watching 90210?  Like you said, I thought it was off the air, right?  I don't even think I ever sat through one episode of that show in the ten years it was on.  Gary, when you were...  You were, you know, doing it under a blanket.  Whacking.  Whacking, yes.  Gary, when you exfoliate, do you use a loofah or just a washcloth?  A loofah, yes.  A washcloth, yeah, okay.  Do you wear his and her shirts? 
[02:07:30]  Her and her shirts.  Her and her shirts.  Jesus.  What douche does Gary like?  I'm a fag like Gary.  Let's go to Dennis.  Dennis, what's going on?  You're next on N.E.W.  How are you guys doing?  Hey.  I must be just as gay as him because I've been watching a show for five years straight now.  Yeah.  I'm straight.  Is that your own opinion?  No, I'm straight.  We're thinking.  But why?  I just, because you know what it is, I moved to an apartment, I didn't have cable anymore.  I'd watch basic cable and get into the show. 
[02:08:00]  That's it.  I don't know if that's a good enough excuse, pal.  I found myself needing a beer, I was in the village, I went to a bar, and next thing  I knew, I was getting in the keister.  I was also miserable in Party of Five went off.  But the joke's on that guy because I'm not gay.  I'm not even gay.  What, you watched Party of Five, too?  That was my favorite show.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  You watch Rosie every morning, too, don't you?  Although the Wendy Love Hewitt scenes were pretty good, but I don't think that was worth sitting 
[02:08:30]  through the crap that was...  You mean when the Party of Five went from Hodgkin's disease?  Yeah, there's a real bang-up show I would want to tune into.  The guy's got Hodgkins.  How did Gary, you watched that one, didn't you?  Yeah, it's Party of Five, Gary.  Oh, my God.  You're a big softie.  Gary, are you going to be tuning in to WNBA next week?  All right, Dennis, thank you.  Hey, but you know what?  I'd rather watch soap operas than the Knicks game last night. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, well, the Knicks are a soap opera.  Put them home.  You guys take care of that.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Just wait until I get you on a basketball court.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  John wants to know if you're a pitcher or a catcher.  There's a bunch of guys that did see 902-1 last night, though.  Dan, what's up?  Yeah, I actually watched 902-1 last night.  You did?  I did, but it was a celebration.  Oh, yeah?  Celebration was that I never have to watch that stupid show.  Party of Five, or what's that other stupid one, Melrose Place, ever again. 
[02:09:30]  Did it get ridiculous?  Like, I didn't even watch it.  I never watched it.  But didn't 902-1-0 start when they were supposed to be in school?  So now, like, years and years later, how ridiculous was it that they still had no lives?  Was that the fact?  Because I don't even know what the storyline was, but how could you?  Like, even Saved by the Bell had to go off the air when they left school.  You know, they started high school.  Oh, is it Gary? 
[02:10:00]  I wouldn't know.  I don't watch Saved by the Bell.  Is Saved by the Bell really still on?  Yes, it is.  I love Screech.  Do they have a whole new cast or something?  Well, they have the new Saved by the Bell.  Oh, all right.  I love it.  Great show.  Yeah, you got a flippin' leg over there to watch.  All right, Dana.  All right, take care.  Well, now we're starting to get on the same level.  Zena's got a lot of cool to watch.  There are some girls on that show that are dressed in pretty much nothing.  Kim, what's going on?  Not much.  You're going to defend Gary?  I was going to, but then he started talking about Party of Five. 
[02:10:30]  Why?  What's the matter?  That's a little too far for me.  Oh, you wouldn't even watch that.  And you have a vagina.  Yeah.  See?  Most definitely.  Most definitely.  I started watching it years ago.  Why don't you talk to Gary?  You have a lot in common.  No testicles.  This is true.  This is very true.  But in college, it was fun.  You drink to it.  You go away from it for a little while.  I came back to watch the last season and see the end.  I don't understand how you girls talk us into watching these girly shows. 
[02:11:00]  Well, my husband actually wanted to watch it, too.  He doesn't have the balls to tell you he doesn't.  Well.  Because I've got to admit, when I used to have to go home after the show, when I had  a home, remember that, Opie?  I remember that.  I used to drive out to Long Island when I had a home.  You used to live very close to me, matter of fact.  We used to commute together.  It was very nice.  I would get home, and I don't even know what night it was, but that goddamn Party of Five  was on.  That frigging Party of Five was on. 
[02:11:30]  And I'm like, why would you sit and watch a show where the guy has, like, got Hodgkins?  You've got your own problems that you've got to sit around and watch a crap show like  that?  And then, Wendy, love you.  It's cancer beyond the screen.  I'd forget everything for two seconds.  Oh, man.  You guys are brutal.  Adam from Manhattan.  Gary, were you crushed when Felicity cut her hair?  Rob from Centerage.  Does Gary buy Teen Beat and Seventeen so he can pin up posters of Dylan?  But Gary, Backstreet Boys or NSYNC? 
[02:12:00]  Who do you like better?  You actually?  No, my friend.  Ah, Ken.  You actually have an opinion on that?  Yeah.  Ken.  Yeah.  How are you?  I can justify watching 90210.  Yeah, you can.  That's it.  That's enough.  Three years ago, my wife made a deal with me.  I'd get a Hummer if I sat down and watched the show.  So I've been a faithful viewer for three years.  Well, how many Hummers did you get?  The one?  I could read a magazine during the show. 
[02:12:30]  I just had to sit in a room and pretend I was watching.  But you only got one Hummer and then had to watch the show for three and a half years?  Oh, every show.  Every time I see one.  Oh, every show.  Then I think I can understand that.  So I've been a faithful viewer for three years.  All right, man.  Thank you, Ken.  Thanks.  Someone wants, Chris wants Gary to go for the wiffle ball bat record.  I see that.  I just got that.  Go get the wiffle ball bat in a Sharpie.  Gary's Penis checking in. 
[02:13:00]  Gary's Penis.  Hi, this is Gary's Penis.  Yes.  I'm just wondering where the hell I am.  Did I get lost somewhere?  Wait, it's a tag team.  Here comes Spaz.  That's funny.  Do you watch Seventh Heaven, Gary?  No, you know, I only be giving you that.  What are you going to do?  You're going to do aerobics and then what?  And then I'm going to go, I've got to go meet my honey.  And what are you guys going to do tonight?  I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  Is there something on TV?  I told you there's popular and charmed.  That is a joke.  That is a joke.  Reruns of Golden Girls.  No, there's like nothing on.  All right, Billy, what's going on?  ER is a season finale.  Boyd, how are you doing today?  I can sympathize with Gary.  I had to watch it last night also.  It wasn't something that I wanted to do.  It's one of those relationship have-to-dos.  I had to watch it with my new girlfriend, Jen.  Yeah, but do you have to bring home tampons? 
[02:14:00]  No, that's Wendy, pal.  My new girlfriend, Jen.  That's Wendy, pal.  Well, she used to be your Wendy.  She's now my Jen.  Good luck.  Have fun.  Hold on to your stuff.  Oh, boy.  You know what's so funny?  I wonder if he actually thought that would annoy me.  I think he was trying to get to you.  Dave from Manhattan, can Gary show us how to give a Hummer on a carrot? 
[02:14:30]  That goes back to the whole Fast Times of Ridgemont High from earlier.  All right.  All right.  I'm getting out of here.  I've been abused enough.  Oh, wait.  Don't do that.  Tom's got a question for you before you leave.  Tom?  Yo.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  These are the best.  Hey, Gary.  Gary.  What happened on the days of our lives today, bro?  I missed it.  What did he say?  What happened on the days of our lives?  Are you serious?  I listened to him all day yesterday. 
[02:15:00]  I came home.  I woke upstairs after working all day.  It was on TV.  I said, are you out of your mind?  I changed the chance.  I said, get out of the room.  I took her out of the bedroom.  That's nice.  You got to sit there.  You're crazy.  What else do you do to her?  What?  What else do you do to her?  I drive a truck, bro.  Yeah.  I said, what else do you do to her?  Huh?  Gary's.  Gary's.  What's that?  What do you do to her?  I throw out of the room.  I can't go to sleep.  You throw out of the room?  What floor do you live on?  Like the second or third floor?  I can't do.  You just don't crap, huh?  Oh, all right, Tom. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you.  You got it, bro.  Bye.  I'm just not good at relationships because I just can't do that.  Anyway.  I can't sit in front of a TV and watch something that I'm not into.  No?  No.  I'll admit it.  I can't do it.  No, you just don't watch.  Well, no, you just, I don't know.  I understand making sacrifices, but the Knick game was on and I went upstairs.  The Knick game wasn't good until the last half hour.  How much time do you actually spend together at the house because of TV? 
[02:16:00]  Like differences in TV?  No, most of the times we agree on what to watch.  Sure.  Like Sandy wanted to see that Jesus movie last night.  I ain't sitting through that.  Same ending every time.  Right.  Gary, can we drip some hot wax on you?  I want the Quentin Tarantino version of Jesus.  Oh, God damn.  That would be a good one.  Like you said, the same old ending. 
[02:16:30]  Gary, did you get tickets yet for the vagina monologues?  She's not ending anymore, right?  You're brave.  Rudy's ex-wife.  You're definitely brave.  Most people would have left 10, 20 minutes ago.  Yeah, well, there's nothing wrong with it.  How far can Gary shoot a ping-pong ball?  Gary, hurry up.  You're going to miss your nail appointment.  Wendy, what's up?  Yes, I just want to say something in Gary's defense. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  Gary, you're playing your cards just right.  Your babe wants to watch this stuff, and you watch it with her.  And you know what?  Whatever you ask for, it's yours.  Anal, oral, whatever it is, it's yours.  I think Gary knows exactly what he's doing.  All right.  Is your real name Wendy?  It is for the time being.  Then we don't want to talk to you anyway.  Oh, is that the case?  All right, Wendy.  Thank you.  You're right.  You guys rule.  Absolutely.  Now, if there's something you want to watch, does she sit down there and watch it with you? 
[02:17:30]  Absolutely.  She lets me watch it for like five or ten minutes.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting ready.  All right, Gary.  You've abused me enough.  If you want to buy advertising on the Opie and Anthony show, who's the guy to talk to?  Yeah.  Going home for a little butt-sags.  All right, later.  All right, Gary.  One, two, three, four.  What's that, a purse? 
[02:18:00]  He's got a bag.  Okay.  All right, Gary.  Bye.  Take it easy, Gary.  There he goes.  Gary, being a good sport today.  I wonder what he's going to watch.  That's pretty funny.  All right, Anthony.  Oh, let's take a break.  Do we have anything else to give away?  Sure.  Let's give some away, because that's all Gary abuse.  WWF or what?  Let's do more WWF tickets.  We've got a pair of tickets to SmackDown.  August 8th at the Continental Arena.  Before you can buy them, tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster.

I'm just going through the great instant feedbacks coming in here.  Real fast, Jack, from the city.  Gary, there are two things a man should learn about watching homo shows.  One, do not talk about watching homo shows.  Two, do not talk about watching homo shows.  Very good. 
[02:20:00]  Earthlink we were talking about there?  Hmm?  We were talking about there.  I wasn't paying attention.  I was reading this stuff.  Yeah, Earthlink.  1-800-EARTHLINK.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Anthony, we got four guys outside.  We got to let them in and say hi here.  Yeah.  They got a few signs on TV today. 
[02:20:30]  Dan, Jason, Josh, and Anthony.  Wow, there's the famous sign.  I saw it on MTV today.  There it is.  Outside TRL, what's your name in the red hat?  I'm Josh.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Josh.  Josh is holding the sign that was on MTV today.  It says, Precious Loves Brittany.  Psychopaths all the way.  Psycho Mark.  You like Psycho Mark?  You're the Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  You guys are great.  Yeah, he's out of his mind, Psycho Mark.  Very good.  And who's the other guy with the sign?  I'm Dan.  I'm Anthony.  Hey, man. 
[02:21:00]  What's that?  I called this morning.  I was a guy this morning.  Dan, the sign guy.  They said, bring the sign.  It says, who is Hane?  And I brought it in for the guys.  And I made the woe sign with Precious on it.  What does that one say?  This one says, who is Hane?  That's what the morning crew, Sid and the morning crew said to Doe on the air.  So I said, all right, guys.  What, are they telling people to go to TRL?  No, they saw me there with the Brittany one.  Brittany Spears was there because I had my sign.  And I made R.  Wait, wait, I'm hearing rumors that they're confused.  The new morning guys, Scott and Sid, who, they're sounding good, by the way, are starting  to tell people to, you know, hang out MTV and TRL with signs. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  No, we might have a little problem here.  Oh.  We're trying to, we don't want to sound like that.  We're trying to, you know, we're trying to be cool with all the new shows and stuff.  But, I mean, the sign, we could have a little problem here.  That's a little weird.  Yeah, we're a little weird.  A bunch of people did call about that, but now we got proof that the guy's in here with  the sign for the new morning show.  All right, the WOW guys get prizes, but you don't get anything for that sign.  No.  You should have seen us when we were waterproof. 
[02:22:00]  We were at Monday Night Raw, we had the WOW shirts on, we would run around, we had the  whole arena just off.  I saw you guys, you guys were like 10th row or whatever, on the right side of the  live TV.  We had the WOW shirts on the whole time.  We had this mother, she was probably like 30 years old, she wanted to take her shirt  off, but she was in front of her kids.  She was doing it.  We had people all over us.  We had the whole arena just stop watching wrestling, just looking at us, taking off their  shirts.  It was like, I don't know, there was like six of you guys all with the yellow WOW shirts  on.  It was just me.  Oh, really?  It seemed like it was more than that, no?  We had a whole following with us. 
[02:22:30]  We grabbed spasms, we were walking around the arena.  Oh, that rocks.  It was great.  Yeah.  Of course, we encourage everyone to get the WOW on live TV, right?  Yeah.  And get even more creative, like Precious Loves Britney, that's funny.  Any Precious record.  We've got to MTV, be careful, the cops all over the place, we almost got arrested today.  You can't get arrested.  They ripped their spine, they had the cops coming to escort us out.  We were running across back and forth at Times Square.  Wait, you guys can't get arrested for holding up signs.  They took our ID and they said they were going to arrest us if we didn't leave. 
[02:23:00]  And the cops are around them, man.  First of all, the whole thing with MTV, they gather up a bunch of people with signs and  then they tape them.  What, if the sign isn't acceptable to MTV that they're going to have them arrested?  Screw you.  Wait for the A-bomb.  Yeah, they don't want the A-bomb.  That's what happened at WWF.  I had my WOW sign and I said I was making too much of a scene.  I was causing too much of a ruckus.  I said it wasn't too much of a scene at a wrestling event. 
[02:23:30]  I didn't want it to throw you down.  That's what frustrates the news crews and MTV and everyone else because this is legal.  You're allowed to put a sign on TV as long as it says F.  One great thing about WWF, I went over there yesterday with my WOW sign, which the girl  called from Florida about.  I was the one on TRL.  I went over there with the WOW sign and they had Stephanie McMahon, Kane, Mankind, and a  couple others.  They all signed mine right away.  In fact, Stephanie McMahon, she was walking away.  I was like, come on, it's tiny.  You're going to get on the radio show like on Friday. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, Stephanie McMahon is going to be on tomorrow.  They were all really great with the sign.  They were really cool.  This was during a press conference.  They let us come down and go to WOW.  Yeah, that was at the restaurant, right?  Yeah, they were really cool to us.  There's your leader right there, Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark is the man.  Lunatic extraordinaire.  Quit like the losers.  Let's make sure everyone understands.  You're allowed to put signs on live TV.  Absolutely.  I think they would have a problem if you were cursing or something. 
[02:24:30]  I don't even think that's against the law.  I don't even think that's against the law.  The only thing that got pissed with me was, you know how they do the street interviews  and they, you know, what song you want to hear?  I jumped in front of the camera and I screamed WOW as loud as I can right in front of you.  Yeah.  Know how many people called with that today?  That happened on MTV today.  You guys absolutely did that.  It was like there's a lunatic jumping in front of, who was down there?  Fat Dave?  I don't even know.  No.  You know, it would be fine if he was just some jerk off going,  Oh, Britney, Britney, Backstreet Boys.  They know that ONA will upstage MTV any day. 
[02:25:00]  There was a whole bunch of little twerps.  And then he's hiding behind the cops.  He's like, grab these guys.  And the cops are like, but they didn't do anything.  No, the cops can't arrest you for that.  And most of the cops are on our side anyway.  They have a job to do, but they turn their backs and start laughing.  They think it's hilarious.  They love it.  Yeah, that red lobster thing that pulled up, they put that right in front of the WOW sign for me.  They had the whole truck back up so I could get on TV.  See?  There was one guy up there giving us the thumbs up, the thumb down,  telling us to get away, move away with the guys who are coming.  So that person who's at MTV, thanks a lot. 
[02:25:30]  Was it one of the white shirts?  It was just one of the guys.  Yeah, Psycho Mark is very experienced with the whole MTV thing outside the window.  He's been chased.  I could probably use a few.  I mean, even bumping into the reporter, we obviously don't recommend that,  but that's not even illegal.  No.  You're allowed to put signs on live TV.  Yep.  It's not against the law.  I believe you're allowed to even have boobs on live TV.  Yeah.  Put it all in mind.  That's the next step.  I'm just waiting for that first girl to be brave enough to flash her boobies on live TV. 
[02:26:00]  We might have some.  That's what we want to say.  We set this up over a year ago.  First girl to do it on the Today Show gets $1,000.  $1,000.  Yeah.  Yeah, the atom bomb.  The Enola game.  Rolling out onto the tarmac.  Oh, look, it's boxcar falling along.  All right, we got Andy from the NYPD.  Info on signs at events.  Andy, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  This sign, it's within the First Amendment. 
[02:26:30]  You can put up signs.  Sure.  Yeah.  We hear you.  Yeah, okay.  No, a little traffic on the Verrazano.  Basically, as long as it's not offensive, it's within the First Amendment.  You can't.  It's freedom of speech.  And they're not obstructing.  If the signs were offensive and it caused a riot, then they would have a problem.  They can put them up.  They're not obstructing.  Yeah.  They're not blocking anybody.  They're not inciting a riot.  Yeah, we already knew that.  But that's why everyone gets so pissed off, because there's nothing they can do about it.  Yeah.  They can threaten our listeners and stuff, but there's nothing they can do about it. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, and we're not going to do anything about it, you know.  Well, thank you, Andy.  Yeah, you guys still rock.  All right, man.  Syndication out, boys.  Yeah, we're trying.  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  I got a new name for spares.  Huh?  It's called Man Bitch.  You guys rock.  Take care.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  Come on.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Terrified secretary.  So we're going to hook you guys up with prizes for helping us out.  You guys rock.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you, man.  Thank you. 
[02:27:30]  Thank you very much.  You guys have been sitting in my car fun all day.  Cool.  You guys want to give out some plugs real fast?  One at a time here.  Do you want to say hi to him?  Any pals?  Something?  No, I just want to thank WWF.  I mean, like they said, they really care for treatment.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  What's going on, everybody?  Adam, what's going on?  Micah, Mom, Dad.  Hey, is everyone doing?  Hey.  Listen to Open Ant, and you guys rule.  Stick together.  Get the signs on TV.  Let's go.  All right.  Hey, Will.  Anthony's on the radio.  By the way, I want to tell everybody to go out and see Silent Industry whenever they come  to your town in Queens.  Thank you.  That's his fan plug.  That's what the plug segment is for. 
[02:28:00]  You're able to plug.  You're allowed to plug.  We weren't going to be allowed to plug.  Whatever you want to plug.  He's pretty great.  He's pretty bad.  I know.  He was all scared like we were going to dump out of it.  You do something for us.  We do something for you, and you've got your plug in.  See how it works?  He thought he was going to get the end.  Did everyone get their plugs in?  Yeah.  Everyone get their plugs in?  All right.  Look, six.  The wowing on live TV has calmed down lately, and we don't like that.  So we're glad you guys got on TV today.  It's fine.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, Ben, take care of them.  Give them some stuff.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks a lot. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Where'd you go?  Thanks, man.  All right.  Good job.  Appreciate it.  Fast-talking guy.  Thanks, man.  I like fast-talking guy.  Fast-talking guy.  Good luck with the band.  Guys, rock.  Dan, Jason, Josh, and Anthony getting the signs all over TV today.  Remember, it's not illegal to put signs on live TV.  Get the fast-talking to do some Strauss tags.  Yeah.  Can he say Excel wiper blades? 
[02:29:00]  Bosch micro.  Bosch micro.  Micro.  Micro.  Triple wedge Excel wiper blades.  We might do this tomorrow, by the way.  We might have to replay the outtakes.  Oh.  Oh.  We got more to do?  Yeah, we got a whole page.  Am I talking about air cleaners tomorrow or something?  Oh, there are tires.  Super plugs.  Super plugs.  Spark plugs.  Triple edge.  Spark plug.  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm on the Southern State Parkway, and I just saw a Ford Explorer go by that says, 
[02:29:30]  Spaz sucks on it.  That's pretty good.  It said, S-B-Z-S-U-X.  It was the license plate?  It was a New York license plate that says, Spaz sucks.  Now, that's funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Super plugs on you guys.  Thank you, Mark.  Thanks a lot.  If that guy's listening, send in a picture of that.  We need to see a picture of that.  All right, Anthony, we got to go to break here.  Yeah.  We got a bit from the O&A archives here.  It was reported in the paper today that Sylvester Stallone plans to do Rocky VI. 
[02:30:00]  Rocky VI.  Tipping into that, is he?  That old gag.  How old is Rocky?  How old is he?  He's 50, 51.  Maybe even 52 at this point.  He can't fight.  He can't box.  What is that?  Rocky VI.  Rocky VI. 
[02:30:30]  After two, it was done, right?  Did you like Rocky III even, Anthony?  Three was just Clubber Lang.  Three was Clubber Lang.  That was good.  Hey, woman.  Say, woman.  Once you come over, I'll show you a real man.  That was a good one, but then it got ridiculous.  You're right.  I must break you.  Dolph Lundgren.  That sucked.  Then the other one with the guy with the AIDS.  Wasn't Dolph Lundgren supposed to be the next action hero?  What happened to him?  Didn't quite work out for him.  Didn't quite pan out for him, huh? 
[02:31:00]  I'm trying to think of what this will be.  Like, is he going to fight, or is he going to be like, you know, take a young boxer under  his wing or something?  No, he already did take the boxer under his wing.  Tommy Morrison.  That was Rocky V, right?  With his son and all that?  Rocky VI.  I come out with a little rascal.  What's he going to do?  Hey, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey's dead. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, someone changed my dependent undergarment.  Changed my dependent undergarment!  Come down in the dependent instead of the boxing trunks.  Oh, yeah.  I'm the champ.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't think that way.  I'm the champ.  I don't think, uh, I don't think it'll gross, uh, like, uh, the first one. 
[02:32:00]  I don't think it'll do that well.  Come on.  I would never go see Rocky VI.  Not in the theater, anyway.  The hell no.  It was on HBO 2 late at night.  You might check it out.  Maybe.  Maybe he's going to do, like, the whole Muhammad Ali thing.  Didn't he do that, too, where he was already, like, getting all punchy?  Yeah, we're going to have a meat-tied.  Have a meat-tied.  But how can we tell Rocky?  Hey, me.  Hey. 
[02:32:30]  Let's go to Ray.  Ray, what's up?  Yo, what are you talking about?  Rocky III is one of the best Rockies.  Hulk Hogan, the ultimate male versus the ultimate meatball?  That was pretty good.  You're 100% right.  I got it confused with two.  I'll be honest.  You know what?  Rocky, too.  You're telling me, like, every time you see it, no matter what, that last ten seconds,  they're both on the floor.  You're screaming, wanting Rocky to get up there.  I liked one, two, and three.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  I mean, four was cheesy at the end with, like, Sylvester Stallone talking about all the, you know, 
[02:33:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, four kind of did block.  How many times can you do it?  Okay, Rocky gets another shot.  Oh, he loses confidence in himself.  He can't do it.  But Adrian gives him the frigging go-ahead, and he goes and kicks up.  I can't do it, Adrian.  I can't do it.  Rocky, you can do it.  Oh, okay, I can do it.  And Paulie's going to be like his son's going to become a boxer now or something, you know?  Yeah.  And Paulie's going to be drunk and screw something up, and Rocky's going to have to defend him 
[02:33:30]  and his honor, and blah, blah, blah.  Do you think it'll be like Rocky's son will be the boxer?  Yeah.  I can't picture it.  They already did Tommy Gunn.  I mean, what else could they do?  Yeah.  And who could forget the great music that came out of this Rocky film?  This is Rocky 3, Eye of the Tiger.  Go for it.  Eye of the Tiger Rock.  I can't do it.  Not keep me left out.  Not jam one more.  Go to the body.  Eye of the Tiger.  Eye of the Tiger.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  They got him dancing to the music.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do.  He's like jumping back and forth.  I don't know how to do this.  I don't know how to dance.  This damn song saved Survivor's career.  Survivor.  Survivor was done.  Rocky 6, the Rocky Lean, Mean, Fat-Burning, Grilling Machine.  It's good.  Look at it.  It burns the fat right out of it.  Maybe.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  Rock.  Maybe he'll be fighting Adrian in Rocky 6. 
[02:34:30]  That's a good one.  He's just a drunk, bitter ex-boxer.  That'd be a good one.  They don't want to do that, though.  It'll probably be his son.  Or he opens up like a boxing school, and there's the next, like, hard-headed Italian guy.  They kind of did all that in 5, though.  I mean, the boxer, Tommy Morrison.  He's taking him under his wing, and the son getting involved.  Stefano, what's up? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I know.  So, personally, from what I heard, too, he's going to be training his son.  They showed a glimpse of it in Rocky 5, where it's always training.  His son's going to be, like, Italian Stallion Jr. or something.  And I'm not going to see, he's going to be, he's just going to take a crunch on a glass table.  Well, I'm going to eat this.  All right.  That's the bit we want to play from the O&A archives.  Thank you, Stefano.  All right.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Very good.  Oh, sorry about that.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, real fast.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what are they going to do?  I have a balloon knot next? 
[02:35:30]  Are they crazy?  Yeah.  And, hey, real fast, tell Fredo to suck it up.  He did fine today.  All right, man.  We're all on the same page now.  I hear you.  Again.  Rock on, bro.  Thank you, Matt.  Talia Shire.  Jeez.  How old is she now, too?  Someone's saying that Rocky's going to come out of retirement for this movie?  Dude.  Is that the chunk?  Are you just saying that or what?  O&A.  I read it on the web.  I go to a movie site all the time, and that's what they said. 
[02:36:00]  He's going to come out for a charity fight, and, of course, he's going to lose at the end,  but believe it or not, sounds pretty cheesy to me.  Yeah.  He has nothing else to do in Hollywood.  I think he's stretching for that one.  What do you guys think?  Yeah.  I've got to die.  That's ridiculous.  All right, fellas.  Hey, real quick.  He should make another Copland movie.  Hey, that blew, too, though.  No, I liked Copland.  You like that?  And I liked him in it.  There's a lot of good actors, but...  There's a lot of good actors, and you're like, there's no way he fits in with this cast,  but he did, I think.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Oh, look at Pete saying he chives.  Thank you, Chuck.  Hey, real quick.  Yeah.  I have PRR every weekend at the 17 on the Turnpike.  I always got my WOW sticker up, and...  Are you PRR?  No, yeah, right, I'm plugging.  And then I'm going to be with Dice and laugh your balls off.  All right, thank you.  All right, guys.  Peace.  Thank you, Chuck.  Now people are saying Rocky dies.  Rocky dies?  Come on.  Rocky 4 set up Rocky 6?  Let's see.  How?  Fred, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Ever since Rocky 4, like before Rocky 4 came out, everybody would say,  no, it sounds going to be a boxer. 
[02:37:00]  It sounds going to be a boxer.  It's not going to happen.  Everybody's been saying that for the longest time.  Of course, every time another Rocky came out, after three,  everybody thought it was going to be his son.  He's going to train his son to be a boxer.  Yeah, but now he's like in his 50s.  He can't fight.  I know, but they're going to do something stupid,  but there's no way they're going to make his son the boxer.  Everybody's been expecting it.  That would be stupid.  It would be the worst movie ever.  Well, yeah, it's going to blow.  It's going to blow.  I'm also working on Stubb, or my mom will shoot two. 
[02:37:30]  I think that has a better chance of getting some people in his seat.  I have the age spots.  I have the liver spots.  Dave from Jersey.  Rocky 6.  Sean Connery wrote it.  Rocky comes home to his cheating wife.  He throws the babysitter out.  Babysitter.  And beats his wife with a sit and spin.  Yes.  She's playing with the children on a sit and spin.  They make up in the end, and she...  The babysitter. 
[02:38:00]  Sean from Jersey.  Rocky 4 was Spaz's favorite.  The big white guy kills the black guy.  I didn't know.  And Ron's saying on line 9,  Rocky fights Muhammad Ali in Rocky 6.  Pretty much.  There is a Rocky movie flub.  We like film flubs.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  What's up, man?  It's Rocky and Apollo.  Hey, how about Rocky against Happy Gilmore 2, man? 
[02:38:30]  Fight Bob Barker.  That's what it's going to look like.  I'm telling you.  If Rocky fights.  Do you remember when Apollo died?  Yeah, Apollo Creed.  And they gave him the red, white, and blue shorts?  Yeah.  And Rocky's thinking back about how he fought Subba Lang?  Yeah.  And in one or two of those scenes,  he wore gold shorts,  and one or two of them,  he had red, white, and blue shorts on.  Yeah, he had the shorts before Apollo gave them to him.  Yeah.  I want to make sure you picked it up,  because I know you're good on that.  I remember that film flub, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  I'm telling you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Hi, Tom.  I'll tell you to Apollo.  You said hello, buddy.  Later.  Later, yeah.  The old dispatcher there from Apollo.  Breaker 1.  Yeah.  Walter.  16 to base.  16 to base, Tom.  I don't have my mileage today either.  Walter.  Yeah.  Hey.  How's it going?  You're on the air, Walter.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey.  All right.  Wouldn't that be scary?  Okay.  I don't know what he said.  I have no idea.  There's a caller who was not paying attention.  I don't understand. 
[02:39:30]  Standing in the middle of the road,  watching the car come right at him.  All right, Ant.  Why don't we play this from the O&A archives?  Oh, boo, boo, boo.  It's called Rocky and the Cleveland Steamer.  All right.  We're in the middle of some movie countdown.  Movie countdown.  And then Anthony just goes off.  Check this out.  We'll be back.  Let's just run down the top ten sports films of all time,  according to USA.  Tenth place, Raging Bull.  Ninth place, Anthony, Slapshot. 
[02:40:00]  That should have been higher on the list.  Raging Bull should have been higher on the list, I think.  Eighth place, Chariots of Fire.  Seventh place, Caddyshack.  Top ten sports films of all time, according to USA.  Number six, Brian's song.  Who could sit through that?  Number five, Bull Dorm.  Number four, Rocky.  Ant thought Rocky should be number one.  Andrew, I got a glass table. 
[02:40:30]  Why don't you squat over it and take a dump?  And I'll be underneath it, and you can grab on me.  Mickey, grab on me, Mickey.  Wasn't that written somewhere in some horse book?  We interviewed the horse from that book, and they claim, according to their book,  that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it.  But you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know?  And like, watching this s**t open up and just dump it out of me. 
[02:41:00]  Oh my God, I'm out of your face!  Oh my face, Mickey!  Oh!  Come on, baby.  Why don't you, you know, open it up and give me one over the glass table.  Oh, yeah, baby.  That's how I like you, sloppy.  I didn't start this!  You started this! 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, give me some.  Oh, look at that.  There's some corn in there.  That's what I see.  Oh, look, I see some peanuts.  Mickey!  She has peanuts, Mickey!  You know, if a girl squads over your table like that, you're hoping, you know, it's a nice sloppy dump.  You know, you don't want anything to get past you, girl.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, that's a little driver.  Ah! 
[02:42:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:42:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I was going to stride over to the table.  That was good.  Hey, Mickey.  Hey, Mickey, come on over here.  Stride on the table, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey.  Oh, no, look, it's first blood.  Mickey, you two first blood.  Not me.  I just started. 
[02:43:00]  You started.  Mickey.  Mickey, grab it on the table, Mickey.  Mickey, grab it on the table, Mickey.  Rocky's for the grab now.  Oh, great.  Okay, where's my check?  Oh, whatever.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:43:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Virgil.  Scouset!  Come on, Visc상et!  Yeah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's wonderful.  Ah! 
[02:44:00]  Ah!  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  Hey!  Okay.  Oh, boy.  It's not as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me blow chucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and that ain't my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1-0-2-7. 
[02:44:30]  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  We love it.  We're there all the time.  Yes.  Although I've got to get back down.  I haven't been there in a little while.  Ever since he's put the Anthony fried ravioli in the appetizer section.  I haven't gone down to see that in the menu.  Live.  Or maybe the Opie.  What did you get?  The eggplant parmesan.  Yeah, you don't pay attention, man.  I'm sorry.  I keep thinking it's the veal parmesan.  That's what they should have given me. 
[02:45:00]  Anthony veal parmesan.  I guess we've talked about it in the past.  Yeah.  I love going out to eat with you when you order the veal.  Well, some people are a little touchy about veal for some reason.  And you like to...  You like to...  I want the veal.  You like to order it nice and loud.  And even though the waitress is working for this restaurant, she's still pissed off at you ordering veal.  It is so funny.  Every single time.  Who cares?  Anyway, Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yeah, great atmosphere. 
[02:45:30]  Good place to take the family or a date.  Great food.  Huge portions.  You get it all at Paisano.  And if you ask Joey, the owner, you just say,  Hey, Joey, Opie and Anthony sent me.  They give you a glass of wine on the house.  There you go.  Paisano of Mulberry Street, the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Give them a call.  965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekends till 2.  2.  2.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  And, of course...  That's a good thing. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  If you're in the area during lunch, huge pasta lunch special.  I love the people.  We get there early, usually 8 o'clock, let's say, and we stay for four hours.  And people are coming in at midnight to eat.  I know.  It's amazing.  It really is.  All right, it's Paisano, Mulberry Street, in the heart of Little Italy.  Hey, kids.  It's your old pal, Krusty.  And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy,  I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show.  Syndication now. 
[02:46:30]  212-757-1027.  Oh, man.  Is it, like, storming out now?  I'm looking forward to hitting the park.  Do some blading.  I don't know about that.  Well, I wrecked my blades last year.  Could be nasty.  Ah.  Bummer, man.  It was nice all day.  Now, when the storm hits, let's see what the weather looks like here. 
[02:47:00]  Thunderstorms.  Look out the window.  It's dark as night.  I'm going to the Doppler radar here.  Yes, yes.  It does look like some red moving in.  With some green and yellow.  All right.  Let's go to the phones, Anthony.  All right.  It's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  What did we learn?  Eli.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  What's up, man?  I learned on the show today that movie trivia is Opie and Anthony's Van Halen song,  When They Run Out of Material.  Run out? 
[02:47:30]  We did at the beginning of the show.  We didn't run out.  We just never had any.  We ran out of gas early.  No, we didn't run out of gas early, but you got us, Eli.  We didn't have much planned today, and we went to the trivia thing.  Yeah, it was dangerously close to wacky morning show territory.  No, it was fun.  We could do that every once in a while, right?  I also learned that Anthony needs to work on a show on Connery.  Oh, why?  It sounded suspiciously like a modified Charles Corral to me.  No, I thought...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Man, you're real picky today, Eli.  Hey, hey, someone's got to do it. 
[02:48:00]  I want to leave you.  I want to keep you guys, you know, on your guard.  Go back to listening to the fan.  There's a famous Eli that calls in all the time on the fan.  Not me.  Didn't they even give him his own show for a while or something?  I don't know.  Thank you, Eli.  Hey, guys, take care.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Very picky.  You didn't like my impression.  God, you try to do this every day for four and a half hours, man.  Jeez, we thought we had a good show.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how are you doing tonight?  Great.  I learned two things.  I learned that dead fish wear wow stickers. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  And also I learned that Gary from your sales force has a yeast infection.  Anyway, hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Litigation now.  Yeah.  All right.  It is.  Litigation now.  Uncle John checks in every day.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I learned today that you guys are the kings of Fast Times to Reach My High trivia.  Well, we did pretty well with that today.  Yeah, you did.  I think the next one we're going to do, I mean, don't worry, we're not going to do this  every day, but I think the next movie we take on is Caddyshack. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, that'll be a couple weeks down the road.  Okay, guys.  It's a syndication when a pot is legal.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Pauly.  Hey, Pauly.  Hey, Precious.  What's up, Wrangler?  Ah, hey.  Sorry, guys.  I learned that if you speak with an Irish accent, you're a lot of curse on the radio.  Is that if you're aware of that or what?  Exactly.  Yeah, that's good, Pauly.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  It's a syndication when Spaz finishes his commute. 
[02:49:30]  All right, bye.  I'm telling you, they picked up on that.  That's funny.  Jonathan.  Yeah, I learned that not only do steroids make you destroy bathrooms, but they make you  dumb.  Wow.  How's it going?  All right, Jonathan.  All right, let's go to the instant feedback.  A lot of good ones coming in today.  Don from Staten Island.  I learned that cashmere has nothing to do with side two of Led Zeppelin IV.  That always bothered me, Joe. 
[02:50:00]  Joe from Bridgeport, Connecticut.  I learned that Opie and Anthony's Doppler radar consists of an open window.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It does look like thunderstorms moving in.  Of course.  They've been talking about it all day.  Hail and all that crap.  But usually it's like, you know, you get the alert.  You ever go on the Weather Channel?  There's a weather update from the Northwestern New Jersey, Northern Central Connecticut. 
[02:50:30]  It's like never the city, but it looks like it's kind of coming this way.  It is coming this way.  Mm-hmm.  Alex from Brooklyn.  I learned that Opie likes to watch porno while a dentist is in his mouth.  Thank you.  That's pretty bad.  Let's see.  I didn't know.  Okay.  But not checking in.  Always checking in.  What I learned today, the name of the dog is Gypsy.  Very good. 
[02:51:00]  Yankee bleacher creature.  He checks in all the time, too.  Today I learned Marco has a new map of Hawaii partner in Gary.  Syndication when 90210 runs a new episode.  Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com.  Today I learned Sean Connery and Mayor Giuliani go to the same speech therapist.  I'll smack you.  It could be worse things than smacking her in the head.  We'll leave you.  Billy.  Smack in the head.  Billy Hayes.  What's up, O&A?  One of Jay Moore's friends there. 
[02:51:30]  How you doing today?  I learned that Rick's loyalties to Jay Moore are as strong as mine.  It looks that way, huh?  You got that right, Fredo.  All right, syndication over here now, fellas.  All right, bro.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Over here now.  Over here now.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that disloyalty to the show, you could wind up with a fish in your car.  Very good.  Over and out there, precious.  All right, blind Dave.  Bye.  Bye.  Over and out, precious.  Dan from Stanford. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, dude.  Oh, that sucks.  I'm never going to live that one down.  Today I learned how to get a police escort if I ever get pulled over for speeding.  Yeah, we did learn that today.  Today I learned Gary's girlfriend's menstrual cycle.  Yes, we did learn that today.  I learned Gary's going to replace Stacker 2 and WWF commercials with Midol and Lilith Fair spots.  Brian from Jersey.  I learned Gary can take abuse better than Nikki from We Deliver Keggers.  Mike from Staten Island.  I learned that Uncle John has no effing like. 
[02:52:30]  Dan from Jersey.  I learned that Eli should go back to his cotton gin.  God, now people are abusing listeners.  That's great.  I learned today on the show that Mike Tyson should be knighted.  Syndication.  Okay, pathetic.  That's from Jeff from Jersey.  Yeah.  Let's go to Eric. 
[02:53:00]  Eric, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned since Anthony's separation.  There's a lot more girls named Wendy.  Yeah, I imagine that.  Imagine that.  You picked up on that very well.  Yes.  See you later, Dreamweaver.  Bye.  Bye.  That's you, Anthony.  No, well, Dreamweaver wasn't me.  Well, it's associated.  I was the Wrangler.  You were diamond dust.  It's associated with you.  I see.  Lewis, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:53:30]  Hey, dudes, I learned a whole bunch of stuff.  Firstly, I learned that Rocky VI, in Rocky VI, Rocky will be fighting his giant, enlarged  prostate.  I also learned that if you fail at everything you've ever done in school, but you can remember  inane, insignificant movie trivia, you still can be a success in New York radio.  Very good.  And, most importantly of all, I learned that Fez is still the dumbest F in all of radio. 
[02:54:00]  Yep.  I heard the guy pick up the phone when I called in one, and he got half of WNEW out before  he dropped the phone or hit the button and clicked off the line.  The dumb F couldn't pick up a phone if you gave him a third arm.  Poor Fez.  He wasn't even on the show today or yesterday, and you guys still abuse him.  Oh, my God.  He deserves to be abused.  He's an abortion that didn't make it.  All right, Lewis.  Thank you.  Take care.  Good job. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, where's Fez?  Is Fez doing his Week in Review this week?  Oh.  Why is he pissed?  Why are you pissed?  That's why I hang up on him.  What's the matter?  What?  There's nothing good for the show.  That's why I hang up on the pricks, Fez.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Why?  You recognize that voice?  No, I'm just tired of getting abused.  I get abused by these callers all the time now.  There's nothing good for the show.  That's why I hang up on you.  Get the message.  Fez, can I tell you something?  You truly are stupid, and I'll tell you why.  Oh, Jesus.  No, and I'll tell you why.  You rant and rave like that, now they're going to come out of the woodwork. 
[02:55:00]  That's the only call you're going to get now.  As soon as they know they got you, they're going to hit you twice as hard.  They're going to hang up on them.  You should have did the famous Opie line.  That doesn't bother me.  That doesn't bother me.  That doesn't bother me.  That doesn't bother me.  You're going to let them finish the show.  As soon as you come in here and rant and rave, now they're going to pound you.  I'll just hang up on them.  They're going to pound you.  Now, are you doing the weekend review tomorrow?  Yes, I am.  It's not going to be racist, right?  If it's racist, it doesn't happen tomorrow. 
[02:55:30]  It's not going to be racist at all.  Because two weeks ago, it was just out of hand.  I was a little over the top.  It's not going to be racist this week.  What are some of the subjects that you're touching on?  I haven't written down somewhere.  I don't remember off the top of my head.  I just like to keep it, you know, suspense.  Oh, yes, of course.  So tomorrow we've got Spaz's Week in Review.  We've got Stephanie from the WWF, Stephanie McMahon, calling in.  We're going to hang up on her if she doesn't have anything interesting to say. 
[02:56:00]  And Monday, some special ed teacher is going to give you a special test.  What is it supposed to test about me?  Your intelligence.  I'll pass it easy.  You know what?  I think you will, too.  That's the scary part.  Because it's the common sense thing you have a problem with.  I think deep down you're book smart.  What?  I'll make a bet.  Dude, I'll make a bet.  Book smart?  Yeah.  How do you define book smart? 
[02:56:30]  What would be like a...  Spaz is like Rain Man.  Spaz?  Because I think Spaz will do well with a test.  I think when it comes to discussing issues that affect all of us, talking about the mayor and this and that, he's a complete retard.  But when it comes to, like, just flat-out facts and stuff that is written down in a test, I think he'll do real well.  I'm willing to bet you.  Really?  Yeah.  I think he's Rain Man.  You drop anything on the floor, he'll be picking it up.  He'll tell you exactly what's on it, where it goes, and everything like that. 
[02:57:00]  But as soon as you ask him what's going on, I mean, if they're common-sense questions, no way.  Absolutely no way.  Probably just intelligence questions.  You know, if a train from Chicago, blah, blah, blah.  Can you answer those type of questions?  I can't.  No, those are simple.  I don't know.  Those are simple?  Who's on the train?  Like, a train leaves Chicago, going, like, 90 miles an hour?  Yeah.  And then, uh...  Okay.  A train leaves L.A.  Yeah.  Heading east, going 50 miles an hour. 
[02:57:30]  Okay.  A train leaves New York, going west.  Yeah.  It is going 20 miles an hour.  Yeah.  As they pass each other, which train is closer to New York?  As they pass each other?  Yeah.  They're both at the same distance because they pass each other.  Very funny.  He got it.  I'm telling you.  It's a trick question.  I'm telling you.  I think he would do well. 
[02:58:00]  I think we're all going to be disappointed at the results of the test.  Who's buried in Grant's tomb?  Grant.  What color was George Washington's white horse?  All right, Spaz.  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  There you go, Spaz, everyone.  Scott, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Precious loves Britney Spears.  That's right.  Hey, I got a question you get asked, Spaz.  Yeah.  Ask him how many pounds of potatoes it takes to make potato chips. 
[02:58:30]  Later.  All right, bud.  Let's go to Wolf.  Hey, Wolf, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that the WOW sticker actually works.  Of course it works.  Yeah, I had my first WOW experience.  Nice.  When, today?  Yeah, it was incredible.  Congratulations.  Where were you?  I was in Northport.  Oh, really?  Yeah, up in the work truck, heading home.  Nice.  Out of the island.  You guys are gods.  Thanks.  Hey, thank you, man.  Bye.  All right, let's go to Matt.  Is it true Spaz has a gig tonight?  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  Matt, what's up?  Oh, I learned that after 90210, Gary's girlfriend said, look what I did to you again.  Indication, what are we going to do about this?  All right, Matt.  Very good.  Yeah, he's a funny kid, man.  Come on.  You've got two good lines out today.  Spaz will be appearing at Privilege tonight.  I'm going to be dancing.  Now, Spaz is at Privilege.  I think he was there last night, wasn't he?  Yeah.  Had a go.  I hate to talk to him so much, but.  He said it went well. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  But we don't know what well means.  Was some of the people ragging him or anything like that?  I have no idea.  Maybe we can hit on that tomorrow.  Spaz is coming in here now.  Spaz is a Privilege.  There you go.  See?  So you did Privilege last night?  Yes, I did.  How'd it go?  Look at the smile.  You knew it very well.  Yeah?  What'd you do?  I went up on stage.  I plugged the O&A show.  Yeah.  I got ragged a little bit.  That's the time.  I introduced the main attraction of the show. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  And she was?  And she was the same girl that was here yesterday.  How'd you do it?  Give me the whole line and the enthusiasm and everything.  All right.  Let's see if I can remember word for word.  I said, what's up?  How's it going, everybody?  I'm Spaz from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Boo!  Boo!  Tool!  Tool!  I'm the guy that hangs up on each and every one of you.  But whether the fans like me or not, I know you're going to love the main attraction tonight. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, corny.  And then I was...  Oh.  Wax ain't horrific, Spaz.  How did you find a flow?  I hope they're paying you well for this game.  Whoa!  Okay.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Yeah.  All right.  Get this up again.  Go ahead.  Whoa!  What's up, everybody?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Now.  What's up, everybody?  I'm Spaz from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm the guy that hangs up on the YouTube every time.  But whether the fans like me or not, I know you're going to love tonight's main attraction. 
[03:01:00]  Be quiet, sir.  Be quiet, sir.  Be quiet, sir.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  I'm going to bring her up.  Thank you, Spaz.  Whether you like it or not, you're going to love this act.  See the way I turn it in?  Oh, please.  Give him the strap.  All right, Spaz.  Thank you.  If you think I'm an a-hole, wait until this dancer bends over.  See the way I tied it in?  All right.  I'm quite a jerk-off. 
[03:01:30]  But after seeing this beautiful girl, you're going to want...  We've got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Don and Mike from New York next, Anthony.  Yes.  They just completed their show in the other studio, and now you get to hear the whole thing.  Yeah.  In a few minutes here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow for FU Friday.  Stephanie McMahon checking in, and, of course, Spaz's Week in Review.  See you tomorrow.  I'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
