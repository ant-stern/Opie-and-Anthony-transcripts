<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with darkly humorous commentary on the first anniversary of the "Miracle on the Hudson," featuring sarcastic remarks about potential celebratory disasters and the playing of air traffic control audio interspersed with offensive jokes.  The conversation then shifted to their experiences filming for the XFL, recounting embarrassing moments and production chaos.  A substantial portion focused on the "Late Night Wars," featuring opinions on Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, and Jimmy Kimmel, liberally laced with offensive language and derogatory terms, alongside played clips from their shows.  The hosts drew parallels between the network's treatment of late-night hosts and their own past experiences.

The show then transitioned to the Haiti earthquake, using highly offensive language and graphic descriptions of the devastation and death toll, while debating the emotional impact in the age of the internet and discussing Pat Robertson's controversial comments.  The hosts criticized Rush Limbaugh's commentary on the earthquake,  followed by listener calls containing vulgar language and discussions about retail data collection practices.  David Blaine's planned Haiti fundraiser was met with skepticism, concluding with an update on the ongoing "Bobo" saga.

The "Bobo" storyline dominated a significant portion, detailing a failed comedy gig in Buffalo, a poorly-received New York open mic performance (with played audio clips and critique),  and a prior show where he was pelted with objects.  A phone call with Bobo from a comedy club followed, along with suggestions for new material, particularly focusing on his numerous dick surgeries.  Caller Footer offered support. This segment also included Anthonyâ€™s plan to play blackjack with fans and an interview with Ian Halpern, who revealed he had access to an alleged Tiger Woods sex tape, detailing its content and alleged drug and alcohol use, and his decision not to release it earlier.

Ian Halpern remained a guest, discussing a potential altercation with Brad Pitt, promoting his books on Kurt Cobain's death, and criticizing Courtney Love.  He further commented on the late-night television landscape, predicting Letterman's success and mentioning a new undercover TV show.  Halpern again mentioned the Tiger Woods sex tape, detailing explicit content and the model's nickname "Lazy Dog," before delving into vulgar gossip about Lindsay Lohan, Liza Minnelli (whom he claimed to have smoked pot with), and Barbara Walters.  Jonathan, Jim Norton's manager, joined, recounting his travels to Cambodia, Afghanistan (including near-fender bender with armed escort), and meetings with Fidel Castro, along with a humorous anecdote about Castro's cigars.

Finally, Jonathan, remained as a guest recounting further travel anecdotes from West Africa, Armenia, Moscow, and Afghanistan, including humorous and often dangerous encounters.  The conversation frequently veered into sexually explicit and offensive territory,  with discussions about sex with prostitutes,  the hosts' and guest's sexual preferences and experiences (including a focus on Jonathan's penis size), and offensive jokes about women and various ethnic groups. The hosts pressed Jonathan about his wife and marriage, and he shared his exclusive on the Tiger Woods sex tape. The segment concluded with promotion of upcoming shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio.  We've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was, where, you know, language was realistic and raw. 
[00:00:30]  Destroy it.  Sexual content is realistic.  And just fucking people reacting with people is realistic.  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I've got a catchy name.  Shit Radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Yeah, look at how small my butthole is.  That's funny.  This is Shit Radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We are live here at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  All this shit is going on.  You've got to do a live radio show.  You can't just throw them a repeat.  No.  Not on a day like today where it's the first anniversary of Sully Sullenberg landing that piece of shit jet in the Hudson.  Is that a year ago today?  A year ago today.  They're having a big celebration. 
[00:01:30]  Opie, just please don't say the year that Sully landed a plane.  Who are you?  Anthony.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  I haven't seen you in a while.  What were you saying?  It's called The Miracle on the Hudson.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to have a breakfast.  Yeah.  They're going to have a breakfast with the people that responded.  They're going to have a breakfast with the horrified passengers.  And, of course, Sully's going to be there with his creepy mustache creeping everybody out.  And then what they have decided. 
[00:02:00]  Man, the people in charge just are just so dumb.  They're going to kind of take a ferry to where the plane landed.  And they're going to toast the situation.  They're going to toast each other.  They're going to toast the water.  Oh, my God.  Please, boat, just sink.  How great would that be?  Oh, they're all flailing and freezing in the water.  Or there's another Sully coming down the Hudson just at that moment.  Yeah.  What irony.  Isn't that ironic?  Don't you think? 
[00:02:30]  No.  Your song isn't ironic at all.  You ever listen to the words of that song?  There's nothing ironic about the fucking song.  But, anyway, it's the first anniversary.  And they're doing a big to-do about it.  To-do?  Yeah, they've got passengers all over local TV here in New York.  And then they'll do the ferry thing later on today and toast the river, I guess.  And then what about-  They're going to say hi to the river.  Yeah.  I say good morning every morning.  And what, there's a special on, is that this Sunday? 
[00:03:00]  Brace for impact?  Yeah, that has to be this weekend.  Where they have computer-generated plane and the whole-  You know, I'm a video-making fool now, right?  This is what drives me nuts.  I said it a year ago.  That fucking plane almost hit my building.  We saw it coming in.  And I had my HD flip, but I'm like, ah, what's this HD flip about?  And it was just in a box on my desk.  And then, I think it was that that made me go, you know, I probably should figure out 
[00:03:30]  what this HD flip is about and start carrying it around, because news happens all the fucking  time.  And I would have had the shot.  The one shot they have really does suck.  You might not have, honestly, dude, even if you had the flip, a moment like, you're in  your apartment, you're probably not going to be carrying it around.  You're probably more likely to have it had you been outside by the park just filming  something.  But if you're in your apartment...  It was right there.  I got cameras all over my apartment now, man.  Here's what you need to do.  Just sitting there ready to go, because...  Right by the window.  Yeah, because it was a jet barely off the water. 
[00:04:00]  It was...  You know when something's different when you look at that Hudson River every day.  Whatever.  But I mean...  You should leave it...  Yeah, do you have one, like, right at the window?  Oh, now I got them everywhere.  But, you know, there's going to be no tragedies outside my window of that.  You don't know.  A lot of shit happens on the Hudson.  Although someone that was in my house that day did take a cell phone video right afterwards,  which is way better than anything I've ever seen on TV.  Really?  Did they give it to TV?  No.  Why?  He's got them where they're just kind of standing on the wings and all that.  It's a pretty good freaking shot. 
[00:04:30]  Well, these idiots, they don't tell me until almost a year later, and then it's on one  of their Facebook pages.  I'm like, what?  You know who they should take a lesson from?  Our own E-Rock, who, if you recall, has some of the greatest pictures ever.  That wasn't for that crash, though.  Wasn't that the helicopter going into the river?  That was the helicopter going into the river.  But when it comes to news, and especially here in the city and pictures, E-Rock's the  man.  If you know, you're able to zoom in eight billion times and pop up the picture. 
[00:05:00]  But now I'm prepared.  So, you know, now I go down the Hudson River when it freezes over, and I pan three or four  times.  Terrific.  That's just like getting sullied landing in the Hudson River.  Waiting for that good shot.  But that's going down a year ago today.  We got the audio, if we want to work through that again.  Oh, Sully.  Do you want to hear the audio?  Yeah.  Let's all remember.  This is our remembrance, and then we move on to real shit. 
[00:05:30]  Here we go, remembering.  A year ago today.  Cactus 1549, turn left, heading 270.  This is Cactus 1539.  It's first.  We've lost trust.  I'm hoping it's returning back towards LaGuardia.  Okay.  You need to return to LaGuardia.  Turn left, heading up 220.  220.  Tire, stop you to park.  You've got emergency returning.  It's 1529.  I noticed they said 220.  They were going to turn right over your building, Jimmy. 
[00:06:00]  It would have been funny, though, if they did.  I was actually.  That was some local Upper West Side humor for everybody.  I like keeping it local.  What I'm amazed at is this.  There's no panic.  No, no.  Really, these guys never panic.  Bird strike, lost thrust in two engines.  Lost thrust in two engines.  Yeah, we're going to come back to LaGuardia.  They're returning.  Who is it?  It's 1529.  Bird strike, he lost all engines.  He lost the thrust in the engines.  He's returning immediately.  Cactus 1529, which engines? 
[00:06:30]  He lost thrust in both engines, he said.  Got it.  Cactus 1529.  We can get it for you.  Do you want to try to land 101-3?  We're unable.  We may end up in the office.  All right, Cactus 1549.  It's going to be left traffic to runway 31.  Unable.  Okay, what do you need to land?  Cactus 1549.  Runway 4 is available if you want to make left traffic to runway 4.  I'm not sure we can make any runway.  What's over to our right?  Anything in New Jersey?  Maybe Teterboro.  Okay, yeah.  Off your right side is Teterboro Airport. 
[00:07:00]  Do you want to try to go to Teterboro?  Yes.  Teterboro Empire.  Actually, LaGuardia Departure guy.  Emergency inbound.  Hey, guys.  Cactus 1529 over the George Washington Bridge.  He wants to go to the airport right now.  He wants to go to our airport.  Check.  Does he need assistance?  Yes.  It was a bird strike.  Can I get him in for runway 1?  Runway 1.  That's good.  Cactus 1529.  Turn right 280.  You can land runway 1 at Teterboro.  We can't do it.  Okay.  Which runway would you like at Teterboro?  We're going to get that. 
[00:07:30]  I'm sorry.  Say again, Cactus.  Cactus 1549.  Radar contact is lost.  You also got Newark Airport off your 2 o'clock and about 7 miles.  Eagle 54718.  Turn left thing 210.  210, 4718.  I think he said he was going in the Hudson.  Cactus 1529.  You saw him?  Eagle 54718.  Climb 181-2000.  Eagle 54718.  Eagle 54718.  Eagle 54718.  Eagle 54718. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sorry.  I missed that.  Say again?  And we're up to 12,000 289.  Okay.  Thank you.  Eagle 54718.  Turn left 220.  220, 4718.  Was that Cactus up by the 7th?  Yeah.  It was the Cactus.  He was just north of the George Washington Bridge when they had the bird sky.  Wow.  So at the end of the call, was he talking to another plane, I guess?  Yeah.  Because Sully said he was out.  I don't think the guy on the study said we're going in the Hudson. 
[00:08:30]  Sully said that.  And then the controller didn't seem to understand what he said.  And he's still giving him directions on how to get to a runway.  And the guy, one of the other planes was like, bah, I think he's in the Hudson.  Wow.  Bah.  That's amazing.  Those guys are amazing.  The pressure, though, man.  It's like he just didn't panic.  Ah!  I'm going in the water!  Oh, my God!  Believe me, that's how it would have...  Burns water!  What are you talking about?  Crash!  Oh, my God! 
[00:09:00]  He probably knew he was going to be okay.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I know I can land in the Hudson.  It might not be good for the people behind me.  Captain Jimmy Norton Burger would have sucked.  Hey, there's my punch and burn in the fucking plane!  I knew this would have happened!  This plane sucks!  Oh, would you like to try to do a runway one at Peterborough?  I knew it's the water!  Runway one, where is it? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Fucking Jersey!  I'm just crying.  Cracking.  It's lost!  Fuck it!  We're all dead!  And this is all going through the...  Yeah, they released the tape to get just a faggot.  But I would have it on the fucking loudspeaker in the plane.  I'm going to die!  Yeah, Sully just went like,  uh, break for impact.  Oh, I'm going to die! 
[00:10:00]  Kiss your loved ones!  God damn, he just really was fucking cool, man.  Yeah.  It's not going to get much better than that.  Nah, that's...  As we move forward through time,  that was one for the ages.  And they're celebrating today.  As they go in the middle of the Hudson River on a ferry  and do a little toast.  Yeah.  A little toast for everybody, yeah.  Oh, with all the plane people?  As many as they could get back, I'm sure.  I don't like...  They're known as the plane people now.  But they become survivors.  Yeah, they're survivors.  Yeah.  They have a story to tell that they're going to have to tell 
[00:10:30]  for the next 50 years over and over and over and over again.  They were talking about that whole get-together  that they're going to have.  Get-together.  And, uh, it's one of those things where it's like,  okay, now they're going to sit there and talk about it.  Like, they talk to everybody.  That's their one big story that they get to tell everybody.  You know that any one of them, one-on-one,  is a fucking dullard.  A year and a day ago,  any one of them I would have fucking burned alive 
[00:11:00]  just to lighten traffic.  And they're all taking one tiny,  That's a good one.  tiny, insie, bitty detail from that day  and just blowing it out of proportion.  Yeah.  Do you know who people want to hear from?  It's the people who are in the emergency rows  who are on the wing.  Because those are the people that...  Those are probably the people with the most interesting story.  Get out of my way!  People are just losing it.  You know the survivors look at one person as an asshole.  Oh, that fucking asshole.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, remember him?  Remember that guy?  That fucking guy over there almost blew it for all of us.  Pushing everyone out of the way,  stepping on children.  They know.  The survivors know who the real assholes are.  And who the heroes are.  Oh, yeah.  There's an older black couple,  and they remember the one guy who was like,  whites first.  He just panicked.  He's an old guy.  Whites first!  Oh, my God!  He's an old man.  That's to be hysterical.  Stay here and die!  Wait a minute.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  One old white guy got knocked out  because he forgot where he was.  You're in the back of the line, boy.  Push!  You never want one of these things to happen to you  in your life,  because it then becomes your life.  It defines your whole life.  It defines your life,  and that's all you have to talk about.  That's all anyone wants to ask you about.  You never want that.  That would be...  I mean, we went to Dealey Plaza  to check out the JFK thing,  and you know,  not only every anniversary,  there are people that go there 
[00:12:30]  every single day  because they were there that day in 1960...  1963.  63, right.  No.  Yeah, 63.  Jesus.  November 22nd.  Oh, my.  And they're there every day  to talk to whoever will listen to them  about what they saw that day,  and they're now really old people,  and that's their whole life.  Their whole life became  just hanging out at Dealey Plaza.  Well, people who weren't even there that day,  people who just are like Robert Grodin,  who we met when we were down there in 2004. 
[00:13:00]  He's like...  They say he's one of the most knowledgeable conspiracy guys.  We were talking to him.  He's there every day.  He's there every day.  Every day.  Since it happened.  Like, everybody...  This event hasn't ended for people.  Everyone that's on this plane,  you know that, as you know,  history, time goes by,  and they drop dead,  every one of their obituaries is going to go,  he was a survivor of flight, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, is that the...  They used Microsoft Flight Simulator with the audio?  Oh, really? 
[00:13:30]  Who did that?  That's pretty cool.  YouTube's been running really slow lately.  It's hard to fucking get video playing for whatever reason.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, look at it.  It's kind of choppy.  Oh, we can't watch this.  They just show them.  Check, 1549.  What is that?  It's a simulation?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the Microsoft Flight Simulator.  I want to be in the cockpit one time  and see what it looks like to take off.  Yeah, it's got to look cool through that window.  It's got to, man.  Just to see what it's like.  You just see blue skies. 
[00:14:00]  Nothing but blue.  You look out the side.  Yeah.  That's true.  Cactus, 1549, 725,000.  Oh, this is a...  Okay.  Cactus.  Now he's just over the water.  Yeah, Cactus, 15.9, new departure to contact line.  Maintain 15,000.  And where's the bird?  The little cigar in the bird.  Cactus, 1549.  And now that it's just charging on banking leftovers to land.  Yeah, that's, uh...  It looks pretty cool, though.  But you're seeing from the perspective of being behind the plane.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  And above the plane.  You're not on the plane.  Graphics have just gotten amazing.  Yeah.  And that would have been just some stick figure plane.  Please, 20 years ago.  15.9, turn left heading 270.  Okay, uh, this is a cactus, 1539.  It's birds.  It's returning back towards LaGuardia.  They show the engines on fire.  Okay, yeah, you need to return a little bit.  They show smoke coming out.  You don't even see the birds.  2, 2, 0.  They should have showed the bird faces close up.  Like bird lips going, ah!  15.9, he, uh, bird strike, he lost all engines. 
[00:15:00]  He lost the thrust in the engines.  He's returning immediately.  Cactus, 1529, which engines?  He lost thrust in both engines, he said.  Jesus Christ.  And now he's...  Cactus, 1529.  You can get it, Steve.  Do you want to try to land runway 1-3?  The plane is shaky.  You know how rocky that must have been going in?  Just trying to keep the nose up.  It's going to be left traffic to runway 3-1.  Wow.  It's banking hard, left coming down.  Okay, when you need to land.  Oh, man.  15.9, runway 4 is available if you want to make left traffic to runway 4.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  What's the word to our right?  Anything in New Jersey?  Maybe Teterboro.  Okay, yeah.  Off your right side is Teterboro Airport.  Yeah.  Do you want to try to go to Teterboro?  He's like, no way.  They got my fucking building.  Teterboro, uh...  That's my building on the left.  Actually, LaGuardia Departs got emergency in bed.  It went right by my window.  Captain 1529 over the George Washington Bridge.  He wants to go to the airport right now.  He's like, no way.  Does he need assistance?  Uh, yes.  It was a bird strike.  Can I get him in for runway 1?  Runway 1, that's good.  Captain 1529, turn right 2-8-0.  He can land runway 1. 
[00:16:00]  He's right over there.  He's just kind of running on the Hudson.  He can't, uh...  Where does your building?  He knows.  He knows at that point there's no making a...  Yeah, he couldn't even...  Like, the Hudson's not that big.  It's not that wide.  He just couldn't clear the Hudson.  And why would you when you got it?  I'm sorry.  Take it, Captain.  He's like, I can't talk to you.  I'm busy trying to crash this plane.  Shut up, dummy.  I got something to do now.  15.9 radar contact is lost.  You also got Newark Airport up here, too, talking about...  Yeah, and they show him going right in from the, uh, simulation.  Pull up.  Pull up. 
[00:16:30]  Yes, water.  Oh, that was a much nicer landing.  Yeah, whatever.  Eagle 540.  That's kind of cool, again.  The simulation's a little bullshitter.  They make it look like he just landed on ice.  His wheels were down.  They show like a fucking...  Steve, did you get that, uh, uh, from Kimmel last night?  The end of Kimmel.  The end of Kimmel?  Yeah.  Yeah, check it out.  Um, what was I saying?  Yeah, so it's a year ago today that Sully landed in the Hudson.  Yeah.  This is the funniest thing. 
[00:17:00]  Okay, before he gets back to his office, we're just having Steve run around getting  late night clips for no apparent reason.  I don't know what happened on Kimmel.  Yeah, of course.  If there was nothing.  So the next time he comes in, it'll be something else.  Yeah.  Okay, he's going to go back into his office, so we'll be quiet.  Um, uh, um, speaking of the late night wars, it's getting real ugly.  I guess TMZ's, uh, reporting that Leno officially, uh, signed a contract for, for the whole hour  now.  Well, they, I didn't know that Jay's contract, this is what, I didn't know that if they pulled 
[00:17:30]  him off the air, he'd have to give him $60 million.  Pull who off?  Leno.  Wow.  For his 10 o'clock show, because you knew he wasn't going in there naked.  Right.  And, uh, $60 million they would have had to.  Wow, they just throw money around at NBC.  It's amazing.  Willy nilly.  That's how they keep, kept him from going to ABC and killing him.  I think, you know?  Hey, they threw us a lot of money after only three shows.  What?  XFL. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't, oh my God, that was a hell of a payday.  They paid us, they paid us for 20 some odd episodes and we only did like three or four.  We made a fucking boatload from NBC.  Did you realize?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they love just put you on a show, cancel it, then pay you money.  It's great.  We did more than three, I think.  I have no idea.  I wish we didn't do one.  I was listening, I was not listening.  I was, uh, uh, for some reason that popped in my head last night.  I was just thinking of that going, oh my God.  Yeah.  Just remember how embarrassing that was to stand on that stage with the dancing girls. 
[00:18:30]  Was it a bad show?  It stunk.  It wasn't good.  Yeah.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't good.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'll never forget the first one we did and we're on a stage and I go to see Pete at NBC  because he's editing it.  Oh, right.  And he's, he's pulling his hair out.  He's actually has his hands and he's trying to pull hair out of his head.  I'm like, what's wrong?  And he goes, look at this, look at this.  And every time me and Ant were on stage, people were playing with our penises. 
[00:19:00]  Like they, they had monitors set up.  So they knew if they use their, their little, little like, uh, fingers, they could make believe  they're squeezing our, our dicks and stuff on stage.  So they had a, they had to edit the whole thing using long shots.  Oh my God.  Pete was out of his mind.  He goes, your fans are animals.  I remember this is when I first started getting to know you guys and I was doing a warmup.  I had been on the show for a little while and I remember doing a warmup at that plate.  Where was that tape? 
[00:19:30]  That was the hard rock?  Yeah, the hard rock.  Yeah.  Can we hear, I, can we hear some of this?  Whatever you want.  All right.  Uh, first beer.  All right.  We had to like, uh, run out.  Oh yeah, that's.  Now you guys are running in an empty XFL field.  Opie slid.  Anthony just grabbed the ball.  Oh no.  Well I pushed him.  No, Anthony pushed me.  I pushed him.  He pushed me forward and, oh whatever.  Look at the stands are empty.  The tee after the kickoff.  Come right back here.  Careful. 
[00:20:00]  I thought it was funny they took the tee from you.  It seems somebody already took it.  What happened out there, Opie?  There's no tee.  Somebody else seems to have taken it.  You look like an ass.  Are you Jesse the body, Ventura?  No, I...  All right.  It was an empty stadium, right?  Yeah, there was no one there.  Sarah.  It was one of the worst.  Attempting to do a comedy show on the sidelines while they're playing football.  It was just a disaster.  It was one of the worst ideas ever for television. 
[00:20:30]  Vince McMahon thought this was going to be great.  It's going to get another football league out there and it's going to be amazing.  Right.  And it just was a horrible flop.  Do you think it was a bomb?  A complete, total bomb.  It wasn't good, man.  How was that bad?  I don't even know where my hitman jacket is.  All right, whatever.  Well, I'm heating it off. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I know.  It's starting to get a little warm.  One day, and maybe you don't know this yet, one day you're actually going to be in the  ring with tights on, flying around, taking what we call bumps.  Sounds like my bedroom now.  Even the tights fit.  These are the fans of the XFL.  Why?  Are you just a bunch of fans cheering?  I've so heard.  You handpicked us for the job to host XFL game day.  Without question, because if there are two individuals who are eminently qualified to  host this show, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  Now, did you mean this Anthony and that Opie, or was there some confusion?  Because we can't figure.  We thought maybe something happened.  You were on medication that day or something.  No, that would be my wife that's on medication.  Well, married to you, Vince.  No, we see what happens there in the ring.  Now, if I can only see the game.  Is there any way to get a helicopter to airlift me out of here?  Obviously, you haven't seen the show.  It's that bad.  No, it's so good that I think it might even go over your head. 
[00:22:00]  No, why would we do that?  Okay, just double check.  You know, it's so good, I don't even think you need to watch it.  Yeah.  It's that good.  It runs itself.  It runs itself.  Just like the XFL.  Right.  Thank you guys very much.  Thank you, Vince.  I find it hard to believe this wasn't scripted.  There wasn't even an idea that like, here's two mics, make something happen.  And I'm like, isn't this supposed to be NBC?  This isn't like college TV.  You would think they would have some kind of at least plan for us. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Nothing.  I really have just kind of forgotten this part of my life.  I just blanked it out of my head.  That was our one chance at being network stars.  Network stars.  And we failed miserably.  How cool was it to like walk in a 30 rock?  We'd walk up there.  Yeah.  Go in.  Saw some of the SNL people just milling about.  Yeah.  We were part of the family at 30 rock.  And we'd walk in for, you know, a couple of weeks.  But poor Pete.  Like, okay, skedaddle. 
[00:23:00]  You're no longer welcome here.  Poor Pete trying to edit this thing.  Oh, God.  When he saw the fucking listeners fucking around with the, you know, what they saw on the monitor.  The line of shit they gave us with, because they've come back to us so many times.  You've got to do this.  And we're like, no, no.  What's the idea?  The concept we got.  Right.  We don't just want to be thrown on television with no concept or idea.  It's like, no, no.  All you guys got to do is host it.  Here's what you guys got to do. 
[00:23:30]  So, bring your listeners down to the XFL, whatever it is, the restaurant down there, WWF restaurant, which was a hard rock.  And just show up and we'll have everything for you.  And then we show up and they're like, all right, what are you guys doing?  I thought you knew what we were, what?  No game plan.  And the cameras, and go.  And we had a radio show we had to worry about.  Yeah, this was after the radio show.  After the radio show, it was like, what do you guys got today? 
[00:24:00]  I'm like, what are you talking about?  You said that we'd just show up.  Right.  And we'd have stuff written and we can do it.  But was Bob there that day?  No, why would he be?  The agent didn't fly in from L.A. when you guys were filming a TV show for NBC?  No.  Of course not.  One of the many horrible deals Bob made outside radio.  NBC paid.  Fuck him.  Hey, Opie's in.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  Opie's helping out with rescue efforts.  That's the old school, yeah.  What is that, CNN?  One of my old douchey haircuts.  I don't do the douchey haircuts anymore.  Finally.  Now that I'm pushing 40.  Figured I would fucking get a haircut like a man.  Like a man.  Seems like you're pushing 40 right up against the wall.  Oh, jeez.  I'm just going to start laughing at everything Chip says.  Oh, Chip. 
[00:25:00]  Late Night Wars.  Where do you want to go with this fucking thing?  I hear Leno had a good note to NBC.  I hear fucking Conan was brutal.  I heard Jimmy Kimmel was great on Leno's show.  What the fuck is going on?  Well, if you haven't heard the news, Conan's out.  Yeah, Conan's out what, a week from today?  A week from today.  He is done.  And I predict, let me have a prediction here.  They're not even going to keep him on that long.  I think he is going to be so brutal to NBC on the air that they're just going to have to pull him. 
[00:25:30]  I say today, well, no.  We've lived in this world.  They say, Conan, you're done a week from today.  They pull him after today's show.  Wow, you think that soon?  Oh, yeah.  That's my prediction on top of your prediction.  My prediction was that they're not going to let him do.  He'll never make it to next Friday.  But I bet you, because they like to make believe you've got a little time to say goodbye to your listeners or your viewers or your fans.  You know, guys, it's horrible that it had to come to this. 
[00:26:00]  But, you know, we want to do the right thing and keep you on the air and blah, blah, blah.  And then next thing you know, you think you're going to be on the air for a little bit and they just yank you.  The locks on the door.  Oh, yeah.  He's done.  My guess he's done after today.  He'll take his little key card and go, beep, beep.  Why does it keep coming up red when I slide it through the security thing?  And then they'll do reruns next week and that'll be it.  It's weird with this, too.  The thing, the difference is, like, we're always afraid.  Radio guys are always afraid that, like, you know, they're going to take you off the air and you have no outlet. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  But this is so big.  It's, like, everything these guys say, the whole country here.  Oh, yeah.  Like, if they were to yank Conan and go, fuck you or pay or play and you're sitting, Conan  could go, fuck you and go on 60 Minutes or, like, or go on any news channel he wants or  on any show he wants.  Ron, he can go on O'Reilly.  He can go on Larry King.  I don't know.  Kenny, maybe there's something in this deal that says, you've got to shut your mouth.  There's always some kind of breach where not only do they not pay you anymore, they sue you. 
[00:27:00]  And now you owe them money.  Wow.  So I don't know if it's as easy as doing that.  Yeah, maybe not.  I just mean that these guys are, the whole country, they could say something.  Dude, a hundred million people here.  Yeah.  So it's hard to fuck with them.  That's true.  Did we ever talk about when we sat for two, almost two and a half years, so we know what  this game's all about, unfortunately.  Yeah, they paid us very well, absolutely, to sit, because they were scared.  And this is the God's honest truth. 
[00:27:30]  And people don't want to hear this, that listen to both shows.  But they were scared shitless that we were going to go to Q104, was the station at the  time, here in New York City, and compete against Howard Stern.  And that scared the fuck out of them.  And that's why we had to sit for almost two and a half years.  But in that time, they threatened us all the fucking time.  Do not do an interview.  Do not show up on TV.  Do not show up on another radio show.  And they made it perfectly clear, if we did any of those things, they would sue us.  And we didn't have as many outlets on the internet. 
[00:28:00]  It wasn't even about losing the money they were giving us, because we knew that we could  make that money back.  It wasn't about the money.  But what scared the shit out of us, and they did a very good job, they reminded us almost  every two, three months, remember, no interviews, no TV shows, no other radio shows.  If you do this, we will be suing you.  Yeah.  For the money.  A lot of money that, and I certainly did not have.  Didn't want to give them.  And that's why we didn't say a fucking peep for almost two and a half years. 
[00:28:30]  And with the internet the way it is now, you could get your word out there.  Right.  You could, like, leak it to somebody else.  They'll fucking Twitter it.  They'll put, some way, somehow, you're getting your side out there without breaching anything.  Because it's hard for them to contain every outlet that's out there on the internet.  When we were thrown off for three years, there really wasn't.  Right.  There was message boards, but then if they find out you were the one that posted this or  that, then you're fucked.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:29:00]  So I don't think Conan has free reign like that.  I really don't.  I don't.  I think there's some things in that contract that are pretty damn scary.  Yeah, his side will definitely get out.  But I don't think it'll be him, personally.  I think you see him go away for a while now.  And by the way, Rosie really annoyed me.  She said, it's time for Leonard to step aside.  And I understand she's a Conan fan.  Oh, my God.  But just as a comic, she should shut her fucking mouth.  But it's like, what do you, she goes, she said, it's time for Leonard to step aside for 
[00:29:30]  Conan O'Brien and not try to flatten his tires before he even gets going, which I'm sure  people say to her when she gets in their vehicles.  Take that, fatso.  So O'Donnell talking to reporters while promoting something said she's a huge fan of O'Brien.  Okay, so she's biased.  She likes Conan.  But she said, if you're privileged enough to drive the bus.  First of all, can we stop with the bus thing?  If you're privileged enough.  I'm privileged enough to drive the bus.  You're going to drive the bus.  Ah, we're going for a ride.  A ride. 
[00:30:00]  Shut up, you fat retard.  A ride.  If you're privileged enough to drive the bus, you should say thank you and drive it to  the best of your ability.  And when it's time for them to hire a new driver, you should say thank you for allowing  me to drive this as long as I did and pass the keys to the new guy with red hair and  try not to flatten his tires before he gets going.  Excuse me, what world are we on where that fucking works?  It doesn't work.  Thank you, Cher.  And it was, no, I'm saying that she's, but her example's not even.  It's stupid.  That doesn't, that's not how things go. 
[00:30:30]  No, it wasn't even accurate.  Why is everyone so angry at Jay Leno?  I don't understand that.  I really don't.  I don't know Jay Leno.  We were on the show once and we met him for what, 15, 20 minutes before we went on and  he was great.  He was a really nice guy to us.  Jimmy has had nothing but great experiences with Jay Leno.  I don't really understand the hatred that's going his way these days.  Because it's been this underlying aggression at him that people for a long time think, they  think that he's not the hip guy.  They think that Letterman's the hip guy. 
[00:31:00]  They think that Conan's the hip guy.  So he becomes their guy.  And they kind of root against Leno, who they see as yesterday's news and mom and pop.  The reality is this.  The bus driver example is great if the bus driver is slowing down on his route.  If he's not picking up passengers.  But if he's still kicking the shit out of the other company.  You don't take a newer driver who has not nearly the success and put him in the fucking  main driving seat.  Give him seven months and all of a sudden the customers are not getting picked up on time.  And then when the other guy wants, you want to put him back.  He'll go, why are you putting the other guy back? 
[00:31:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Conan's driving around with one person on the bus.  Yeah.  And it's her.  It's her.  Ah, drop me off by the bus, people.  I'll talk to people.  I have to make pee-pees and not wash my hands and then talk food.  Look, Conan is getting screwed.  Absolutely.  Yes, he is.  To completely blame Leno is ridiculous.  They shouldn't blame Leno at all.  It's ridiculous.  He never wanted to be pulled off.  And by the way, people got to stop.  This is what big comedy fans got to stop doing.  If you don't like Jay and you think he stinks, that's a valid opinion. 
[00:32:00]  If you don't like a guy's comedy, that's fine.  You can't argue that.  If they don't like it, they don't like it.  Fair enough.  But when someone says, like, his hack show, it's like you got to learn what the word  hack means.  And if you're out there and you call Leno a hack, you really don't know anything about  comedy.  If you don't like him, fine.  You think his humor sucks, okay, cool.  Let me jump in with that point Nick DiPaolo was in yesterday, and you guys were discussing  how, you know, Jay does, you know, comedy in his monologue that no one else will touch.  He gets really fucking edgy with some of his stuff, as far as network TV goes. 
[00:32:30]  Racial stuff.  And this is what drives, it's like we're doing the test shows and stuff, and we're doing  the round table panel where we, you know, the four of us, one of the topics we covered  was the fucking Lockerbie bomber being freed.  And we talked about the Lockerbie bomber.  And it's like, there's none of those late night shows are going to let you fucking do  jokes.  And again, none of us did Pan Am victim falling out of the sky joke, but to address that at  all, none of them are doing that.  And, you know, and then he did a sketch on the show about the fucking, they did like a, 
[00:33:00]  you know, guys pulling oil into the British embassy or whatever it was.  It was tying in the Arabs with it.  No one else is doing that shit.  And it drives me nuts that if people don't like him, fine.  But anybody who says, oh, the guy's a hack, or you just, you don't know anything about  what comedy is or what the word hack means.  Don't throw around words you've heard people use when you don't know what they use.  Kind of like I do with fucking sociopath.  I say that too much.  And Anthony and I were invited to do Leno's show next week, but I don't know.  We're thinking it over.  We might go there. 
[00:33:30]  And, you know, I don't know.  But I'm not a big flyer these days, so I'm not really sure if I want to go there.  But, you know.  Oh, you should.  We're such important people that Leno really needs to talk to us next week and get our opinion  on this whole thing.  So, I don't know.  We're thinking about it.  We might have an announcement by Tuesday if we're going to do it or not.  So, I just want to get that word out there.  Make him sweat.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the bullshit that I see on a daily basis. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Can I ask why are people pitting the talented guys against each other, though?  Jay and Conan.  I mean, I understand.  People make Jay look like the aggressor.  But Conan is the one.  And, again, I understand him wanting to host The Tonight Show.  A lot of people say it's the most prestigious gig in show business is to host The Tonight Show.  Right.  But five years ago, they went to Jay and they said, this is what's happening.  He didn't ask for this to happen.  So, anyone that's shitting on Leno for just being there and being willing to go back to where 
[00:34:30]  he never should have been removed from, you don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, true.  If you hate Leno, that's fine.  But just don't be inaccurate about it.  So, what do you want to do?  I didn't see the Conan thing addressing NBC.  We got Leno's note to NBC.  We got Jimmy Kimmel getting involved.  What do you want to start with?  Because all of this is really good.  Start with Conan?  I have gained such respect for Conan, by the way, because he's a fucking...  The guy is just going out there and he's smashing them and he's not taking it lying down. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, I love the fact that he's smashing NBC.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I'm getting attacked on Twitter and stuff.  I like Conan.  I did like his 1230 show, but, you know...  What do you want from us?  You're just giving our opinions.  Why would anybody...  I don't understand it.  They just don't...  They're reacting emotionally.  And I'm very biased because I like Jay.  And if I thought he was wrong, I wouldn't come on here and shit on him, to be honest with you.  I really wouldn't.  But it's like, I don't think he's wrong.  It's easy to defend him because I don't think he's wrong.  Yep.  Right.  Okay. 
[00:35:30]  Here's Conan O'Brien from last night.  Thank you so much.  Hello there.  I'm Conan O'Brien, NBC's Employee of the Month.  Isn't that nice?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's getting crazy around here.  Free soup down at the commissary.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's big.  You know, of course, everybody knows NBC and I are having a little tiff right now.  Yeah.  Little lover's quarrel.  If you will.  Now, there's a rumor.  This came out today.  There's a rumor that NBC is so upset with me, they want to keep me off the air for three years. 
[00:36:00]  That's what I said, yeah.  Yeah, my response to that is, if NBC doesn't want people to see me, just leave me on NBC.  It's like I'm going to be in the witness protection program.  Time sure does fly, though.  It's crazy to think about this. 
[00:36:30]  Do you realize that a baby born on the day we did our first Tonight Show is now a slightly larger baby?  You still can't walk.  A little harder to hold now.  Yeah.  When you put it like that, it really, well, it doesn't make you think.  No, no, no.  Stop it.  Wow.  That's hilarious stuff.  Vincent Bayonne makes a pretty good point.  I really don't have a side in the late night wars, but I see Conan's fans being more of the hip savvy internet crowd that make their presence more well known than Jay's crowd. 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  It's the same thing that works so well for Obama.  That's a pretty good point right there.  Yeah.  I don't think the Jay Leno fans are, like, Twittering and Facebooking and coming up with, like, a nice little graphic they could put on their Facebook pages and their Twitter pages like they're doing with Conan.  No, they're just watching the Tonight Show at 1130 when Jay's on it.  Right.  I mean, that's what they were doing.  It was like Louie said when Louie, when Lucky Louie.  But they're getting their voices heard a lot, a lot more than the Leno fans. 
[00:37:30]  I guess they feel like the guy is being screwed, and I certainly, I understand that.  But just don't blame Jay.  The network screwed up.  I mean, look, it happens.  But don't make the fucking other performer the bad guy.  It's like Leno fans shouldn't be shitting on Conan.  The guy just wants to host the Tonight Show.  He wants to do his gig.  Yeah.  Conan continued.  Now, my future is, well, it's pretty uncertain right now.  And this is absolutely true.  I'm not making this up.  I received a letter from the adult film company Pink Visual offering me, this is true, offering me a role in one of their porno movies. 
[00:38:00]  That's true.  That's absolutely true.  Absolutely true.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  I looked at, yeah.  In the movie, I'd be having sex with a beautiful woman, and just as we're about to climax, I get replaced by Jay Leno.  Yeah.  I got it from here, kid. 
[00:38:30]  I'll think over now.  Hi, lady.  Hi, lady.  I don't even want to think about that.  You know, I got a different approach to this whole thing.  I think this is the best thing that could happen to Conan O'Brien.  You hear a different energy.  You hear, it's almost like it's catapulting where he needs to and wants to be now.  And I think if he gets out of the NBC contract, someone will certainly pick him up immediately. 
[00:39:00]  And I think now he's really, truly ready to take that next step.  Because when he moved down to 1130, we said it on this show, the buzz was nothing.  Yeah, it wasn't there.  It was more of a buzz when he was on at 1230.  But there's something about Conan now that I feel.  I just feel it.  Maybe he was a little nervous and scared when he moved down.  I don't know what it was, but you weren't hearing anything about Conan O'Brien's Tonight Show.  I think he felt he had to kind of conform a little more because it's the Tonight Show, 
[00:39:30]  so you've got to be a little more, I don't know, respectable than he was with his later night show.  And this now is bringing him back to the way Conan was.  And an angry Conan is very good.  You could tell.  He's just one of those fucking, like, you could tell he could probably be a real nasty, mean guy.  And you know what, we do our best work when we're angry and when we have nothing to lose.  I think at this point Conan feels, I have nothing to lose. 
[00:40:00]  And I think that's really freeing for him creatively.  And you really hear it in these clips.  And I don't think it stops here.  I really don't.  I think this really pushes him forward now.  For real.  Well, here's one more clip from Conan.  But all joking aside, I really do consider myself a very lucky person.  I do.  No matter what happens, it's been a real honor to sit in the same chair as Steve Allen,  Jack Parr, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, and Jay Leno.  It's, uh...  That's right. 
[00:40:30]  Thanks.  See, here's a touchy feedback, but you know, the truth is the truth.  Uh, Steve from Germany, slash Huntington.  He's like, uh, you guys when NEW and Howie fucked with you.  Uh-huh.  We kind of know this shit when people are fucking with you behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Yeah, although the...  We kind of know this game a little bit.  It's, uh...  This is much more the company, I think, doing it.  But people forget, like, on Leno's last Tonight Show, he had Conan on.  And he welcomed him.  He didn't give any public indications. 
[00:41:00]  He didn't try to turn people against Conan.  No.  He was actually saying in interviews, hey, you know, they've got to give him some time.  You know, Jay wasn't shitting on Conan or trying to undermine him publicly at all.  But you've got to think Jay wasn't happy.  But he just knew how to play it right.  I will say that...  Unfortunately, I would have to fucking vocalize that and blow everything up.  That's my problem.  But Jay just knew, I'll just go with this.  He could have been happy, like, you know...  He absolutely could not have been happy.  But he played it perfectly.  Could not.  And was palling around with Conan, making it easy for him to, you know, take over the show at the time. 
[00:41:30]  I'm going to guess that he was very, very angry at being pulled.  Yeah.  Against his will.  He never wanted to be pulled.  All right, we move on.  We got Leno.  Fucking Kimmel is just killing with this.  He did a 10-10.  Yeah, and he made fun of it, or he was on it.  Did you see the clip of him...  I did not know.  ...coming out as Jay Leno?  No.  You haven't seen that yet?  No, I saw the photo of it.  Yeah, yeah.  And he had the cadence of Leno down.  Can you find it real fast?  It's a minute clip on YouTube.  Jimmy Kimmel the other night comes out dressed exactly like Jay Leno with the hair and everything. 
[00:42:00]  He even had a fake fucking chin.  And it went down like this.  I think we have it here.  Oh, fuck.  Did you make commercials on the intro tubes?  This is what we're going to...  And it's going to be with every clip.  He didn't...  Hang on.  It's not even...  Oh, that's on one of those where they make their own TV show.  It's a clip show.  Stop it.  Just get the...  Dan, the actual clip's like a minute 30 if you see...  That'll...  All right.  We're going to be on again this weekend for the fourth weekend in a row. 
[00:42:30]  Did you hear about this?  Absolutely.  The second highest grossing film of all time.  Second highest grossing film.  Second highest grossing film.  Even Tiger Woods came out of hiding to see it.  But in all fairness, he thought the term 3D referred to the alien girl's bra size.  He thought 3D.  The music. 
[00:43:00]  The steel and the Leno music and everything, right?  So much money, I hear NBC's trying to move it to 10 o'clock.  That's fucking funny.  That's a different clip.  He did the whole show pretty much as Jay Leno.  But when he first comes on stage as the one.  It's about...  It's a minute 27 second clip if I remember.  That's funny.  If you find it.  Whatever.  All right.  So, uh...  Then we...  Let's start with Leno.  Leno's note to NBC.  And then Kimmel did Leno last night.  And everyone is talking about how he just destroyed Jay. 
[00:43:30]  Destroyed the situation.  And just got huge, huge laughs.  But first, Jay Leno.  Welcome to the new show.  I'm a celebrity.  Get me off NBC.  Yes!  Well, in other TV news.  It's hard to believe there is other TV news.  Sarah Palin has signed with Fox News to be a correspondent.  Well, in a statement today, Fox said if Ms. Palin does a good job, they will sign her to a long-term contract. 
[00:44:00]  If she doesn't work out, they'll just blame Leno.  That's what I said.  As you know, with all the controversy going on here at NBC, actually, the Tonight Show with Conal O'Brien's ratings have gone up.  They've gone up.  Really?  So, you're welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Now, Ricky Gervais is hosting the Golden Globes on Sunday right here on NBC.  Said he's really looking forward to it, which is rare.  A host that's happy on NBC. 
[00:44:30]  You never see that.  You don't see that anybody.  They are smashing NBC.  Well, hopefully they have a sense of humor over there.  And then Kimmel came out.  Any big late-night news?  I don't know, Jay.  I watch Oprah at night.  All right.  All right.  We have ten questions.  Question number one.  You had fun impersonating me Tuesday night on the Jimmy Kimmel Show.  What is the secret to doing a good Jay Leno impression? 
[00:45:00]  Well, I hate to give away my secrets, but it's part Sylvester the Cat.  It's part Curly from the Three Stooges.  And part Scrappy-Doo.  So it would be like, uh, Fuffer and Thuck Attach.  Honey, you want a live guy?  And then, if you have like, and this is for kids at home, if you have Silly Putty to make  yourself a nice big Dudley Do-Right chin, that works too.  I'm sorry that's all the time we have. 
[00:45:30]  My next, no.  Number four.  If you got to interview anyone in the world, who would it be?  You and Conan, together.  Oh, okay.  I would like to have the two of you.  In fact, if Conan won't do it, I'd like just you.  In fact, I'd like to do 12 at 12 with you tomorrow night.  Really?  If you would be willing to do that, because I have a lot of questions to ask you about  this whole thing. 
[00:46:00]  I don't think people care about what I have to say.  I agree with that.  Tomorrow night, it's, uh, tomorrow night's bad for me.  All right, let's move on.  Oh, it is bad.  I thought this was good.  It was good.  Does it get better?  Maybe it picks up.  Ever order anything off the TV?  Like NBC ordered your show off the TV?  Yeah, yeah, no, no.  That's funny.  Actually, something like that, yeah. 
[00:46:30]  No, I, uh, yeah, I will order any, if I see an infomercial more than nine times, I  will order the product.  I have a Snuggie, a Slanket, I have Chia Pets, I have Mighty Putty.  I tried to order Ryan Seacrest once.  Really?  But he wouldn't come.  Number seven, you grew up in Las Vegas and hosted The Man Show.  What's the most number of lap dances you've had in one night?  Jay, my mother's watching the show, so. 
[00:47:00]  Actually, no, wait a minute.  The show's canceled, right?  Nobody's watching the show.  My mother's not watching the show.  The mom's not watching.  I'm not much of a lap dance guy.  I'm more of a lap band guy myself.  Lap band guy.  Yes, I don't like, you know, strippers,  I don't like in general, because you have this phony relationship with them for money,  similar to that of when you and Conan were on The Tonight Show together,  passing the torch.  Right, right, yes, yes.  You know what I'm saying.  Yes, yes, I do. 
[00:47:30]  Yes, I do.  Wow, Jay really doesn't know what to do with this.  He's a little puzzled.  He must have known that he was going to get fucking slammed.  Yeah, slammed, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I mean, he must have.  What do you fear most?  Volcanoes.  Volcanoes.  Tidal waves.  Okay.  Yeah, actually, I lived in Seattle.  I was scared of Mount Rainier.  It just sat there, but I was scared of it.  Okay.  I have dreams about tidal waves. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  I fear the network will move my show to 10 o'clock.  Right, all right.  I had that nightmare.  Yeah.  He does just keep pounding him every question.  Number nine.  Is there anything you haven't hosted that you want to host?  Oh, this is a trick, right?  No.  You get me to host the Tonight Show and then take it back from me?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not going to.  Listen.  No, no.  Listen, Lucy, I'm not Charlie Brown. 
[00:48:30]  I don't fall for that trick.  No, I'd say the Soul Train Awards.  Soul Train Awards.  I'd like to be the Soul Train Awards.  What is going on here?  Yeah, but you see, Jay's just kind of setting himself up with the question here.  Yeah, he kind of is.  Yeah, he really is.  But he should be slamming him back a little bit somehow, someway.  I don't know.  I don't know what he's supposed to do with this, but.  Finally, number 10.  A, B, or C.  You came on at 10 of 10 because, A, you love innovative satellite technology.  B, you're promoting your own show. 
[00:49:00]  C, you want to keep me happy in case I decide to switch to ABC.  You know what?  It's all of the above, really.  Listen, Jay, Conan and I have children.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All you have to take care of is cars.  That's right.  I mean, we have lives to lead here.  You've got $800 million.  For God's sakes, leave our shows alone.  A plea from Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy, thank you very much, my friend.  Are they friends?  I'm sure they are, yeah.  Have to be the best.  He never would have had them on if they weren't friends. 
[00:49:30]  You know, his letterman didn't go on.  Yeah, exactly.  That would have been a fun time to say.  Speaking of letterman.  We'll wrap up with this 30-second clip as far as the late-night wars go.  You know, Jay is getting a lot of negative publicity, so he has released now a message reminding people of what he, Jay Leno, stands for.  We have a copy of it here.  I think you'll find it enlightening.  Take a look.  Jay Leno is middle America.  He represents traditional American values, the things this country was built on, like killing Indians because you want their land. 
[00:50:00]  Jay Leno.  America's standing up for Jay.  That's right.  That's right.  Here we go.  By the way, Jay's not from Indiana.  Dave is.  Jay's from Boston.  He's not middle America.  He's not from the middle of the country.  Just kind of bash him somehow.  He's from a big city. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I love that illusion.  The Jay's this fucking yokel from the Midwest.  Yeah.  He's not.  And there you have it.  The latest on the late-night wars.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know something?  Honestly, I don't even watch him unless, like, Jimmy's on.  When Jimmy's on, I watch.  I'm not a big fan of the let's watch some celebrity sit there and plug his fucking show product or whatever. 
[00:51:00]  So I can't be bothered.  There you go.  It just doesn't affect me.  They said Conan has trounced Flutterman for the last few nights because he's a...  Trounced.  Yeah, I love that word.  But he said he trounced him just for, you know, because everybody's watching the car right now.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  Get into some other things.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I think that just tired me out.  Did it?  Yeah, it was too long.  Really?  Yeah, I was like...  Nah. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  We'll regroup and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  2-0-2, 2-0-2.  2-0-2.  2-0-2.  1-97 on Sirius.  2-0-2 on XM.  Opie and Anthony live.  I want to say hi to everybody that doesn't feel like sitting through a replay today and wants live programming.  I know you're out there.  I know you take a peek on Fridays.  And you know what?  We appreciate that.  Absolutely.  So, we've got to decide if we're going to be doing this Leno thing next week.  Oh, yeah?  I think next Wednesday or Thursday they want us out there in L.A. to give our opinion on the whole late-night wars thing. 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  It's a great opportunity to tie ourselves to a big story, Anthony, and make it about ourselves instead of the late-night wars.  Is that it?  Yeah.  So, what do you think?  Should we do this?  Oh, sure.  I don't know.  I don't really like to fly.  I'm not a big fly guy either.  I mean, maybe if they could give us a train ride out there or something, we'll do it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That might work.  But, I mean, you want to talk about tying yourself to a story that has nothing to do with us. 
[00:52:30]  This is perfect.  Five people are enjoying that.  I understand.  Whatever, man.  Hey, Haiti.  Haiti has a bit of a problem.  What's going on there?  I took a breath to say that, and you got it up first.  Cocksucker.  What's the death toll up to?  What's the bullet points with this Haiti?  I know...  They say 50,000. 
[00:53:00]  50,000 dead?  As of now, or their estimate?  Could be more.  That's the Red Cross's estimate is 50,000.  You know what?  The fucking paper.  Yesterday, I think the headline was...  500,000.  Half a million.  Half a million was on the front page.  They don't know.  Half a million and 50,000.  There's a big difference there.  They don't know.  There are whole towns, little suburbs and stuff, that are on hillsides that just collapsed  and kind of rolled down the hillside a little bit and crushed everybody that was there. 
[00:53:30]  Unbelievable.  And then they just showed some footage of the people just dead on the side of the streets.  Just piled up dead on the side of the streets.  I know you don't have much emotion in your soul, Anthony, but does this bother you at all?  Not on a personal level.  Like, I've seen suffering around the world on television and on the internet.  I brought this up yesterday.  I'm going to challenge you on this.  It's different nowadays.  Because what I said yesterday was that...  I think it's the same nowadays because of the internet. 
[00:54:00]  No, I think it affects you more because of the social networking and because the pictures  are higher quality.  Basically, I made the argument, because we've talked about it over the years, when you see  death and destruction somewhere else in the world, it doesn't bother you as much because  you're not really connected to that, right?  But with this Twitter and this Facebooking and this Skype and all this shit, it really  brings this stuff a lot closer to you. 
[00:54:30]  Do you know what I'm trying to say?  But it works the opposite way because it desensitizes people to it.  That's true, too.  I don't know if we're to the point where we're being desensitized by this yet, but I see that's  where we're heading.  I think I am.  You are.  I swear.  I mean, there are certain things.  Like, the tsunami was giant.  Killed, you know, a quarter million people.  And I'm not just going to sit there and bash it or, you know, say anyone deserved anything. 
[00:55:00]  And who was that?  Pat Robertson was saying Haiti brought this upon themselves when they made a deal with  the devil to get the French out.  Like, the guy's talking fucking crazy.  He's talking crazy.  He is talking crazy.  He's talking about the devil.  And my question, if we had him in here, was, how do we make a deal with the devil?  Or does Haiti suffer for the rest of time?  Is there some way where the Haitian people could sit down and talk it out with the devil? 
[00:55:30]  Or not?  Ask Conan.  Or are they cursed for the rest of time?  I think you're cursed forever.  When you make a deal with the devil, that's it.  You're done.  The contract has to end eventually.  Nah.  He was saying you got Haiti and then the Dominican Republic, and they're just separated by a line.  And the Dominican Republic couldn't be more different.  Yeah, they're fine.  They're a successful little nation.  And Haiti has been nothing but a shithole. 
[00:56:00]  Haiti's Tropico.  For years.  Haiti is Tropico gone bad.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  Tropico.  Gone bad.  Where I'm playing it.  Right.  I'm the leader in Tropico.  And you'd rather get a beer downstairs than see what's going on in the game.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you get back to the game and go, oh, fuck.  They're attacking the palace.  Shit.  It's one of those games where it's like, I should have paused that before I left for a bathroom break.  Yeah, yeah.  Because now there's revolution. 
[00:56:30]  You feel like it can run itself for that time?  Yeah.  The big presidential palace has collapsed.  Presidente.  El Presidente.  El Presidente.  Your palace, it has collapsed.  I was looking at the news and they had the Google Earth images before and after.  Pretty impressive.  Of the earthquake.  Oh, wow.  That fucked that place up.  Yeah.  I mean, severe.  And that place was pretty bad to begin with.  You know, they have some modern buildings and stuff.  And the presidential palace was very nice and everything. 
[00:57:00]  But for the most part, it's those shanties and shacks and mud huts that you see when you drive from any Caribbean airport to your luxurious hotel.  Yeah, that doesn't piss off the hotel workers at all.  Yeah, yeah.  When they have to go to work every day.  They're the ones going to the places that crush them in earthquakes.  Right.  And meanwhile, you're sitting there going, I'm inconvenienced.  I think I spilled my drink.  Well, these Caribbean islands are used to these disasters, but not on this scale. 
[00:57:30]  Wow, this earthquake is just, it's a biggie.  It was.  This one's a biggie.  It was a biggie.  And they're not prepared for anything like that.  They weren't prepared for just life in general.  A very impoverished nation.  Well, how are they going to be prepared when they already know a hurricane's going to come, not a hurricane, yeah, a hurricane's going to come along every, I don't know, 10, 15 years and destroy a lot of their land.  And bash some crap.  So they're already, they already accept their fate living on those islands. 
[00:58:00]  They just know, look, we don't have the resources to build stuff like they do in San Francisco.  Yeah.  It is what it is.  And we just hope for the best every time there's a hurricane coming through, or in this case, an earthquake.  Earthquakes.  But man, did they get hit real hard this time.  Earthquakes are devastating in these countries that don't have, that have very old buildings.  They don't have the technology or the resources after the fact to even care for people.  So, you know, a lot of people wind up dying. 
[00:58:30]  And now, of course, the disease fears because there are literally thousands of dead people just on the side of the street.  They just kind of move them to the sides of the street.  I saw a news clip.  They're piled up.  But, jeez, I'm just looking at the, this little hoodie.  Is she wearing a little Jets hoodie?  A little Jets hoodie today.  A little Jets hoodie?  Yeah, we'll get into the tilt there a little bit.  Yeah, well, yeah, so it...  So you're not really bothered? 
[00:59:00]  No, it bothers me like any tragic news story that I watch.  I'm not sitting here, like, freaking out about it, going, oh my God, what can I do to help?  But, you know, I'm not sitting there and going to, you know, tell them to go fuck themselves.  You know, obviously, they get world aid, which is good.  Their plane's flying in and they can barely keep up with it, apparently.  The runway, they got one runway there that works.  So they're just offloading the planes on the sides of the runway. 
[00:59:30]  And then that plane's got to take off and get the fuck out.  So the next one can come in while they're pulling supplies off of the runway.  I'm happy to hear you're not saying fuck Haiti.  That's nice, Ant.  No, I wouldn't, there's no reason to say that.  There's a real dumb fucking redneck hillbilly that, on his Twitter, said fuck Haiti because  we have problems in this country.  Yeah, we all know we have problems in this country.  But this is a devastating blow to a, is Haiti, I guess, a country, right? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So it's a devastating blow to their country.  It's a little different.  It's not because, we give it $100 million, right?  If you use $100 million donated to a country who's just trying to build something, you could  say fuck that country.  But I don't think it's a waste of money when you're pulling people out of rubble in the  streets.  Yeah.  I think there's a certain amount of U.S. dollars, like that money, if it wasn't given  to Haiti, was not necessarily going to be spent on U.S. citizens.  Take money from somewhere else that we wasted and go fuck them and spend it on U.S. citizens. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  But you know what?  When there's still half-dead people and fucking families trapped under rubble, it's like,  I don't mind giving money for that.  Well, that's what they're doing.  They're sending food, water.  They're sending emergency crews, rescue crews.  Well, Obama pledged $100 million, and that's just an acknowledgement from our country.  That's not a lot of money.  Maybe it is a lot of money for the Haitians.  Sure.  Maybe.  But as far as this country goes, that's just us acknowledging, wow, this is horrible for  humanity, and we're going to give you a little something-something.  Yeah.  So to say, you know, fuck Haiti on your Twitter, you're just a fucking dope. 
[01:01:00]  Steve from Bay Show saying this.  A dope.  Back it up with some intelligence, and then maybe I'll listen to what you have to say.  It's tough.  Steve from Bay Shore.  It's tough for a country to have a strong economy when their main exports are voodoo  dolls and rapists.  See, you've got to get the jokes out, of course.  Steve from Bay Shore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Haiti is not really known as being a powerhouse economy beforehand, and now, you know, their  biggest and most important city is pretty much wiped off the face of the earth. 
[01:01:30]  I was telling you before the show, I mean, and it hit the part of Haiti that is trying  to get something done, you know, where they do have some kind of, what am I trying to  say?  Some kind of...  Infrastructure.  Sure.  There you go.  They did, anyway.  Right.  Now there's marauding bands of youth with machetes looting and hacking people apart that are trying  to take their stuff.  Well, man, you missed a good show yesterday because Jimmy and I learned so much about 
[01:02:00]  Haiti from this fucking caller that went on and on and on.  But he did say that there are gangs in Haiti that are so vicious and so scary that they  don't, like the police and the government and all that, they don't even acknowledge  it.  Don't fuck with them.  They don't fuck with them.  They don't go in those areas.  They just have given up and have allowed these gangs to just run these areas, some of the  areas of Haiti.  Yeah, it's not, you know, obviously they've had a horrid tragedy and a lot of people are  dead, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it was really an awful place to begin 
[01:02:30]  with.  Now it's unlivable, even in their biggest city.  But back, you know, before the earthquake, not the, you know, the best spot to be going  on vacation.  Let's get back to that devil thing, because according to Pat Robertson or Roberts, Pat  Robertson.  Pat Robertson.  I was like, uh, he says they made a pact with the devil and that's why they're fucked  now.  Right?  Yeah.  And why didn't we mention this?  Why does it take a listener who doesn't get credit? 
[01:03:00]  Cause all I see is a phone number.  Haiti should challenge the devil to a fiddle contest.  Oh my God.  But they don't, they don't have Charlie Daniels.  We have Charlie Daniels.  Maybe instead of, uh, sending a hundred million, we sent Charlie Daniels down there to battle  the fucking, uh, devil.  Georgia.  The devil went down to Haiti.  It doesn't sound right.  Im was looking for a soul to steal.  Does Charlie Daniels play a mean fiddle?  I know.  Anyone else sick of that fucking spot? 
[01:03:30]  Does Charlie Daniels play a mean fiddle?  Yeah, there he goes.  Anyone?  Anyone?  I'm the only one that's Geico.  I've not heard that.  Thank you, Anthony.  Oh, really?  You haven't seen that commercial probably a hundred times?  I block out Geico.  Come on.  The gecko.  Does Charlie Daniels play a mean fiddle?  Yeah.  What's the new one they're doing?  Elmer Fudd.  Oh, the Elmer Fudd thing.  Yeah.  Actually, the Elmer Fudd is pretty funny.  Trying to make Elmer Fudd speak properly.  This is the first time, but they like just pound those commercials.  Yeah.  Boy, let me tell you why.  Come on.  Turn this up. 
[01:04:00]  We're trying to help Haiti.  This is what we're doing today.  This will get him out of trouble.  That's right.  This is how you deal with the devil.  Now, you play pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due.  Ah.  I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul because I think I'm better.  Oh, well.  Get the French out.  And it might be a sin.  But I'll take your bet.  Oh, old Charlie Daniels.  Now, the best has ever been.  Johnny Ross and up your boy playing fiddle hard.  Cause hell's proclusive, Georgia, and the devil deals the cards.  Where's the parody that gets people fired? 
[01:04:30]  Get your soul.  Who's willing to admit they want to hear this whole song this morning?  I love this song.  It's on my iPod.  You know what?  If you were a true Charlie Daniels fan back in the late 70s,  you didn't like this song, and you called people that liked it Posers.  Posers?  Yeah.  Cause, like, you were into the deep tracks of Charlie Daniels, 
[01:05:00]  and this was their hit.  It's like Grateful Dead people and, you know, one of their hits.  It's like saying you only like...  The Grateful Dead analogy is basically...  They call it Beginner Dead.  Like, real deadheads call, like, the Poppy Dead songs Beginner Dead.  If you, like, touch a gray, you are not a dead fan, right?  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah?  Who's going to be...  Boo!  Who's grateful to...  Boo!  Boo!  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  Hey!  I don't think I'm saying anything.  You're pretty good, old son.  But sit down in that chair right there, and let me show you how to do it.  Who's grateful to be dead?  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  We don't have to listen to Charlie Daniels.  Hey, we definitely went to Georgia to take a bus if we have a good car or something.  Can I hear that Geico guy?  Does Charlie Daniels play a mean fiddle?  I want to know exactly what he says. 
[01:06:00]  Switching to Geico really save you 15% or more on car insurance?  Car insurance.  Does Charlie Daniels play a mean fiddle?  Fiddles.  There's an old Charlie Daniels.  He can still fucking fiddle.  He is a fiddling old bag of shit, isn't he?  You can tell when he walks away, he's like puffin' and puffin' hip replacement surgery.  Like, look at him when he walks, he's limping like crazy.  Geico.  He's kind of waddles.  15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.  He probably does 400 times. 
[01:06:30]  No, no, we have to get the gecko next to your booter, do you?  The pretty Australian gecko.  Well, it's a pretty good campaign by Geico, but the problem is they bought way too many ads.  Yeah.  So, yeah, you hear, you see these too many times, I guess.  So, Rush Limbaugh is in the news today because of what he has to say about Haiti.  About Haiti.  No, I want to listen very closely to this.  And let's dissect Limbaugh's fucking angle on this Haiti thing.  We're going to rebuild Haiti? 
[01:07:00]  Or how are we toxic?  Yeah.  Yes, I think in the Haiti earthquake, ladies and gentlemen, the words of Rahm Emanuel,  we have another crisis simply too good to waste.  This will play right into Obama's hands, humanitarian, compassionate.  They'll use this to burnish their, shall we say, credibility with the black community in both light-skinned and dark-skinned black community in this country. 
[01:07:30]  It's made to order for them.  That's why I couldn't wait to get out there.  I like Rush.  Yeah, exactly.  He's really fucking out of touch with anything about blacks.  He really is.  I've got to say, Rush Limbaugh is really fucking out of touch.  Why do you say that, Jimmy?  He just, it's like when O'Reilly went to the restaurant with Sharpton and was surprised that they actually, oh, they're just not yelling and hooting. 
[01:08:00]  It's like, Jesus Christ, dude.  What, did you watch a fucking, like a black-sploitation movie and that's all your knowledge about blacks?  That's what you know.  Do you ever hang out with a black guy and just shoot the shit and have like a real racial argument?  Like, and things can happen without having to bring Obama and stuff into it.  Bush would have done the same thing.  I was just going to say that.  Any president of the United States would send aid, talk about it, say, hey, they need some help and whatever. 
[01:08:30]  Or, so this isn't, believe me, I'd be the first one to jump on anti-Obama bandwagon as far as policy goes.  But this one, how are you going to fault a president that's pledging some aid?  The people who are literally laying under fucking rocks.  Yeah, dying.  As we speak, someone is going, oh my God, they're never going to find me.  I'm dead.  Yeah, and suffocating.  The whole world is going, all right, let's help out.  The Chinese are sending over some cigarettes. 
[01:09:00]  God bless.  God bless both of you guys for fucking, yeah, acknowledging that.  Jesus, you're right.  Rush is just really an idiot.  And I don't want a little acknowledgement here.  Jimmy, you asshole.  This is Eric in Farmington, New Hampshire.  You can stop it right there.  I am now cleaning coffee off my desk.  He's a fiddling old bag of shit, isn't he?  Coffee everywhere.  That was me who said that.  In capital letters with an exclamation point.  Whoring. 
[01:09:30]  Boo!  Play a good fiddle, dude.  Not a fan of Charlie Daniels, are you?  No, my mother never liked him.  She said that he was kind of southern and I don't respect that woman.  My mother's a saint.  What was the second most popular Charlie Daniels song?  Anthony was the big Charlie Daniels fan.  That's the number two song by Charlie Daniels.  Line them up and shoot.  It's a song, it's a, Simple Man is a big song by him, too.  Simple Man was very big.  But that was a slower kind of ballad-y thing.  That's not the same Simple Man as Skinner, right? 
[01:10:00]  Okay, because I don't know.  I don't have much knowledge on this Charlie Daniels guy.  Let me, let me, let me, let me.  I just gave you all mine.  I need to run it.  Long-haired Country Boy was a big one.  South's Gonna Do It Again was a biggie.  I would go with South's Gonna Do It Again, right, Ant?  Yeah, South's Gonna Do It Again was a big one.  What are they gonna do again?  Rise up and put Negroes in chains.  Exactly.  That's basically what he's saying.  That's pretty much it.  What are you doing?  I like the South. 
[01:10:30]  What are you doing?  I like the South, but can we stop with Dixieland?  Come on.  You're not a fan of Dixieland?  How can you be?  Look, it's not about being politically correct.  What's wrong with Dixieland?  Because it wasn't just a theory or a thought.  They fucking, they were, they just kind of enslaved blacks and made them fucking do work for free.  You know what?  That's part of what the South was about.  At one point, yes.  I understand that.  But there is also a pride in what their beliefs were. 
[01:11:00]  And a lot of people like having that pride through the flag, the Confederate flag.  What beliefs did that cover?  Just that they fought and sacrificed for their beliefs, which was, we're not going to kowtow to the North.  We're not going to free the Nigs.  That was their beliefs.  It was a civil war.  It was more than just slavery.  It was pretty much the North.  In the end, that's what it comes down to.  The North was getting very industrialized and the South was being pretty much kept out of it. 
[01:11:30]  And there was a disparity going on between the North and South.  The North was running the government and pretty much cutting off the South.  And they got, you know, a little pissed.  Slavery thing?  Yeah, that was part of it.  It's a big one.  But it wasn't, it, eh, eh.  That's a big one.  Because they had so, all their labor, or a lot of their labor was done by slavery. 
[01:12:00]  And it's free labor.  To give that up, it's almost like, it's almost like if this company all of a sudden had to pay this show what it was worth.  Well, the, a lot of the thinking behind the reason that Lincoln freed the slaves was to cripple the South.  Because they had slaves working the South.  And it allowed the young men of the South to fight in the war.  And they decided, look, if we take away their labor, their boys are going to have to work. 
[01:12:30]  Or they're not going to have any materials to make a war with us.  It'll crush them.  Yeah.  So that's what it was.  It wasn't this, it was a war, it wasn't this big, noble Lincoln.  Lincoln's got some very, some quotes that are very pro-slavery and very anti-black.  And treat blacks like, in some of his quotes, that they weren't human.  Can I say, though, why would, if it was during the war, why would Lincoln's freeing the slaves mean anything if they were being, if they were controlled by the South and they were in a war? 
[01:13:00]  It's almost like, why would the warring sides, why would they respect Lincoln's decision?  Oh, exactly.  Yeah, some of them didn't.  Why would any of them refer to it?  Well, some of them did.  Especially once they were losing the war.  I just don't, this is where I just, my knowledge of American history is not.  Yeah, that's true.  I make a good point.  And it's like, oh, fuck you, I'm going to keep my slaves.  And some of them did say that.  And, you know, got their asses handed to them. 
[01:13:30]  And some of the blacks found out and burnt down plantations.  They weren't happy.  No.  Or what?  Okay.  Yeah, I didn't realize you were going to go so deep with your Dixieland.  I just, like, you know, you hate Dixieland.  I don't hate it.  I just.  Just that whole Dixieland fucking symbolism.  I don't hate the South at all.  Too many brass instruments for me.  I just don't like the fact that it's like, it's like some time, like, let it go.  All right.  So we're going to do it again.  Do what?  The South's going to do it again.  And you're not.  I'm still waiting.  That song's about 30 some odd years old. 
[01:14:00]  They're going to do it again.  And there's a line in there that goes something like, you know, proud to be a rebel because  the South's going to do it again.  Because he's a rebel.  Are you?  Yeah, he's a rebel.  Johnny Rib.  He's not.  He's a rebel.  Tucks in his flower shirts with his big stomach.  He's a rebel.  No, look at him.  Colorado, Brandon writes, we're talking about Haiti a little bit here.  He writes, some people call it, hell, I call it Haiti.  Call it Haiti. 
[01:14:30]  Brandon writes, we sent aid.  They send AIDS back.  Now.  Oh, gee.  Now.  That's just wrong.  And everyone wants to talk about the legend of Wooly Swamp.  I don't know who Wooly Swamp is.  Oh, God.  That's going a little deep.  That's a deep track for Charlie Daniels.  The legend of Wooly Swamp.  You know that.  I'm just looking at it when Danny's popping up some Lincoln quotes.  And you know one has to be anti-black if it's on the Stormfront website. 
[01:15:00]  What'd he say?  Stormfront.  You're the only one in the room that knows that.  What, Stormfront?  I don't know.  I would have thought it was a Weather Channel site.  I love how you assume we all go to the same place as you do.  Hey, I have no idea what Stormfront is.  Tell me what Stormfront is.  Stormfront's a white supremacist, separatist site.  All right.  Or, as it's also known, the Kumia homepage.  Oh, man.  Would you like to make this your homepage?  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  But you said.  You have to bump nmania.com. 
[01:15:30]  You said it like you were referencing Google, though.  That's the problem I had.  I'm like, yeah, Stormfront, of course.  Stupid me.  There was something else.  Oh, sure.  Yes.  Off my Twitter, actually.  I can't even give out your fucking Twitter name because it's too weird and long and shit.  But he writes, when the hell is Jesse Ventura going to be down to Haiti talking about the  metal thermite that caused the earthquake?  And, of course, he'll do it nine years later.  No, it's not the thermite. 
[01:16:00]  It's that fucking project.  A harp.  Harp.  Harp caused the earthquake.  See, they wanted to bring down Haiti.  So they took the harp waves and made an earthquake.  Shut up.  They were testing it on Haiti.  On Haiti.  What's next?  I'm just asking the question.  Well, it makes sense.  It makes sense if you think about it.  I'm with Jesse Ventura on this.  Well, thank you for your service to the country.  Not much.  We're not losing much as far as the entire world goes if we test the harp on a country 
[01:16:30]  that's in rough shape to begin with.  Yeah.  So I think Jesse might be correct on that.  What do you think?  Thank you for my service.  I wish I would have said thank you for noticing nothing when you were at ground zero until you  saw some college kids video.  Yeah.  Thanks for noticing nothing awry while you were there.  We're not making a statement until fucking the building rubble had already been cleared.  Good job.  How about some original thoughts back in, I don't know, October of, when was 9-11? 
[01:17:00]  September.  How about 10-11?  2001.  Right.  I was just going a little further in a couple weeks later.  How about some original fucking thoughts on the whole thing?  All right.  Here's the second part of Rush Limbaugh.  Oh.  Okay.  Back to the phones.  Or to the phones.  We're going to start in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Justin, you're first today.  Great to have you with us.  Hello.  Mega Rush, baby.  Ditto.  Because my question is, why did Obama, in the soundbite you played earlier, when he's  talking about, you know, if you wanted to donate some money, you can go to whitehouse.gov 
[01:17:30]  to be directed.  Yeah.  You know, why would, if I want to donate money to the Red Cross, why do I need to go to the  whitehouse.gov page and look at the property?  Exactly.  Would you trust that the money's going to go to Haiti?  No.  But would you trust that your name's going to end up on a mailing list for the Obama people  to start asking you for campaign donations for him and other causes?  Absolutely.  Absolutely right.  That's the point.  Besides, we've already donated to Haiti.  It's called the U.S. income tax. 
[01:18:00]  He may have a point about the guy.  He has an absolute point with the emails.  Well, this administration is known for grabbing up any name they can and putting you on a  list so you will be bombarded by Democratic propaganda, election.  Republicans will do the same fucking thing next election.  No, they didn't.  They're going to.  But this...  Now that all the social network and everything else has exploded, they'll take advantage  too.  They will.  But when you visit a website, especially a .gov website, like whitehouse.gov, 
[01:18:30]  you're not expecting that your name is going to be put on a mailing list to then help  out the incumbent that is occupying the website and the White House at that time.  He makes a good point there.  Why not just say go to the Red Cross dot com or whatever the fuck it is, org, whatever,  and donate there?  Look at this.  Find more information online.  Clintonfoundation.org slash Haiti earthquake. 
[01:19:00]  Why go there?  So that Hillary can fucking then pound you with emails when a heart time comes up?  And, I mean, you mentioned the Red Cross thing, and I actually retweeted, like, if you text  a certain thing, you know, $10 to go to the Red Cross thing.  I thought it was nice, so I fucking retweeted.  Whatever, right?  People killed me and said, you know, that is a horrible organization and the percentage  of money that actually goes for the...  So, wherever you go, someone's going to have a problem. 
[01:19:30]  Wait, if you retweeted, what, that number?  That was, uh...  Yeah, it's, uh...  I mean, if you...  I mean, is it worth saying on the air?  I don't know.  I'll say the number if it's not going to Haiti.  No, it's the Red Cross.  No, some people have a problem with donating to the Red Cross because, you know, uh, they're  not happy with the percentage of money that actually goes to the cause.  Same thing with, like, uh, the Jerry Lewis telethon.  They say that's a horrendous charity to donate to because, because the amount of money that  actually goes to the cause.  But you can't win in the end.  I was just trying to do the right thing.  And then people were slamming me for picking, uh, the Red Cross thing. 
[01:20:00]  It's the ulterior motive that gets me with the sending people to the WhiteHouse.gov page  instead of the Red Cross page.  Regardless if you believe what money is going where and who's getting it and stuff, the ulterior  motive to drive traffic, to use a tragedy like this, to drive traffic to your site.  Yes.  Click the link to help the Haitians.  10% goes there. 
[01:20:30]  I have a link fee.  Yes.  Look at, look at my girl cams and help the Haitians.  This is Becky Tittyballs.  Click on her nipples to help the Haitians.  We also made a deal with the devil.  But we're getting Charlie Daniels involved, trust me.  And our fucking fiddle player is going to be better than your fiddle player.  Would you like links to Jim Norton's show?  It'll cost you a buck.  But yes, a tenth of a cent of that would go to Haiti. 
[01:21:00]  That's right.  Yes.  Every dollar you send will be stamped with a logo.  You make a good point.  It is bullshit.  But we do live in a world where you can't do anything without them taking advantage of you.  We all just finished our damn Christmas shopping.  What?  You know, it was a month ago or whatever, right? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  You can't even buy anything anymore without fucking giving them all your info at the cash register.  I don't.  I don't either.  I say no.  You know what I heard this Christmas season?  I go, nope.  Well, we have to.  No, you don't.  We have to put something in the system.  Then put something in.  Or I can't make the sale.  I'm like, that's bullshit.  Then put in, you know, AAA at AAAA.AAA.  I know the deal the companies make with the fucking cashiers.  They're like, look, the more you get, you know, they're getting a piece of the action.  It's obvious.  Because now they're just flat out lying. 
[01:22:00]  Like, look, we can't make the sale unless we put something in the system.  Give them fake numbers.  And then I'm like, well, if I give you my email address or my address, you promise not to send anything.  I promise.  Yeah.  Like the dumb sales girl knows.  I even, they go, no, we just click something.  I go, let me see the click something.  And there's a box, they click, but sure enough, fucking a week later, there's shit coming in the goddamn mail.  You know what I do?  I say no.  I had that, can't remember, you and I were in the best, but was I with you?  And the guy wanted the information.  He's like, I need your number or whatever.  I'm like, no.  And he goes, I need it.  I'm like, you're not getting it. 
[01:22:30]  You don't need it to make the sale.  Right.  Ask for a supervisor.  I have to.  Okay, good.  Get me your manager.  Yeah.  I want the fucking store manager.  Yeah, that's not legal.  They don't have to ask for a fucking number.  Put in 111, 111, 111, 111.  And then call Amex, call your Amex and tell them they don't want to sell me something unless I give them this information.  But they make it a hassle to the point you're like, all right, here's my fucking number.  Never.  No, you're a minority though, Jimmy.  And most of us will fucking, you know, unfortunately give the fuck in.  I'm a minority with white guys with huge cocks.  But yeah, I always say no. 
[01:23:00]  And you know what?  I tell them I don't have a phone.  Don't have one.  Yeah.  I don't have a phone or an email.  And then they get pissy at you.  Yeah, I'm like, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Why am I giving you my fucking number?  I'm a celebrity.  Say, what's yours?  Give me yours.  Yeah, give me your, put your number in.  Yeah, put your number in.  Put your number in email in there.  I don't want it.  You know what I say?  I say my mother doesn't even have my number.  And that really shuts them up.  Oh, damn.  Like, wow, how the fuck am I going to get his number if he doesn't even give it to his own mom?  Why wouldn't you give your mother your phone number? 
[01:23:30]  My mother's a saint on earth.  Kenny.  You know what I do to aggravate those cash register people?  Just stand there.  Besides that.  You're a dullard.  True.  True that.  Oh, Jimmy's tickling him with a banana.  Got your back.  Oh, Kenny's got his own banana.  They ask for your name.  Not his pants, though.  No, no.  There's nothing there.  Dirty plantain.  And this really annoys them. 
[01:24:00]  They ask for your name.  I go, Cash.  Johnny Cash.  And they just look at you.  They ask for your zip code.  I always go, 90210.  That's funny.  I got it.  I got to start doing this.  Yeah.  And then, you know those little tags now that you have to have on your keychain to be in  the shopper's club for every store.  Right?  Yes.  They always ask for those tags.  And I go, no.  Real men don't shop with coupons.  I'm not, you know. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Do I need a tag?  Like, I'm not a member of the club.  Can I shop here?  Do you have a CVS card?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Do you want one?  You know you'll get 20% off your purchase right now.  Don't care.  And then what I start doing is, you know how they have a bunch of, like, little shit for  impulse buying around the register?  Yep.  I just start picking up going, how much is this?  No.  And they tell me.  Like a child.  Yeah.  And I'll pick up.  How much is this?  That's how you get them back.  Oh, good one.  Can you say, did I already talk about what Kenny does when a woman. 
[01:25:00]  Ran by him on the escalator.  Do we talk about that on the air?  What?  Careful.  Can you say it?  Like, not radio way, but just the way you said it was so annoying to her.  Careful.  No.  I don't know.  He can't do it right.  You've got to be in the moment.  No.  He just went, careful.  The way you would scold a child.  Oh.  You've got to be in the moment.  All right.  Listen.  But then he makes it like this big showbiz thing.  Kenny's the worst.  Careful.  Careful.  Kenny's got to recharge his battery. 
[01:25:30]  Plug into the wall so he can use you a little more today.  Yeah.  I know.  He's on the wall.  Your battery life sucks.  We have an expert on Haiti coming.  When?  I am.  A little while.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim, the trucker.  Jim.  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Whoa.  Anytime they want my email address, I always tell them stevec at boundarymusic.com.  Punch it out.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, really?  This is their new trick? 
[01:26:00]  Pennsylvania, what's up?  Lately, and the last time I remember was at Lowe's, they ask you for your phone number  in case you have to return something.  And I'm like, well, what the fuck is my receipt for then?  And I never give it to them either.  I don't know for sure, but this is all trickery, I know that much, because I think the cashier  gets a little something something for all the phone numbers they get during their shift.  Maybe a little commission?  Yeah, because they're working way too hard to try to get your number, and sometimes they're  just lying to your face, like we said, we need your number or we can't make the sale. 
[01:26:30]  And a lot of people will fall for that.  Oh, dude, I call them out.  I'm like, well, get me a manager.  Let's say hi to Sleepy.  Hey, Sleepy, are you awake?  Yeah.  I'm here.  Hi, boys.  Hey, Sleepy.  Hi.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Yo, what up, man?  Ah, not much.  All right.  I kind of peddle him backwards here a little bit, but when you played your first Rush Limbaugh  clip, you kind of fell into his little trap there.  How is that?  Well, because he does this little bit now every day called the media tweak of the day, where 
[01:27:00]  he goes and does something really outrageous just to see what the media, like the liberal  media, the Huffington Post and all that, is going to make up, you know, that he didn't  really say, and then play it back to their crowd, and then they just go ballistic.  Yeah, okay.  I didn't know he does that, but you know what?  You just fell for the trap.  That's his way of getting outrageous stuff out there without fucking, you know, the whole  world coming down on it. 
[01:27:30]  It's like our most offensive song contest.  Exactly.  We just did it to play really offensive songs.  These are his real thoughts, but he figured out a way to do it where they can't go after  him because he's saying, no, man, I'm just being outrageous on purpose here.  To show you what the media does.  The media.  What do they say about the light and black skin communities, like light and dark skin communities?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was doing that little Harry Reid thing.  Yeah.  We learned yesterday.  Oh, okay.  That's all black guys.  You know what?  Maybe I, you know what? 
[01:28:00]  I learned yesterday that Haiti has that same issue where they have a problem with skin  tones in their own country.  Maybe I was wrong then.  You know what?  Maybe I did what I always hate other people do.  Maybe I took a piece of a sound bite and this.  Out of context.  Out of context.  Out of context.  And not knowing that Rush does do that or he was being sarcastic about Harry Reid.  If that's the case, I was wrong.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You are wrong.  All right.  I'm rrr.  All right, Fonzie.  A lot of people tell me I remind him of Fonzie.  Oh, yeah?  He said, babe, I have a good time, so they call me Fonzie. 
[01:28:30]  That wasn't bad.  Yeah, sure.  Let's see what happens then.  A lot of people say the Dominican Republic is just as big a shithole as Haiti.  I did not know that.  I know they have all the resorts that people do like going to.  Not just this big a shithole stop.  Is there an actual resort you could go to in Haiti?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I stopped off there.  Great places in the Dominican Republic.  I stopped off there on a cruise ship.  Did you walk into town?  It was Royal Caribbean bought their own little island off of Haiti. 
[01:29:00]  Like, bought this thing.  And it's like a compound.  You go in there, there's no real sand.  It's like dirt.  And it's not the best place that I was on.  And not the best beach I was on, as far as my cruise experiences went.  Yeah.  It's just terrible.  It's their own little fucking place.  They bought it. 
[01:29:30]  I love it.  Yeah.  Royal Caribbean, Haiti Island.  It's supposed to just go into Haiti.  It was terrible.  I was like, what?  I'm going to Labadee.  What was it called?  Labadee or something like that?  Yeah.  It sucked, by the way.  It was terrible.  Well, it's Jason who works at Cashier, I guess.  Jason in Detroit.  Jason, how are you?  Hey, morning, fellas.  Hey, buddy.  I'm not a cashier.  My wife is a manager at one of the major drugstore pharmacies or whatever. 
[01:30:00]  And if they don't ask for your cards, if they don't get like a certain percentage every month,  like if they don't ask for your club card, after a while you'll get terminated because you don't scan enough in.  And they don't get any money or any kickback.  It's just...  Oh, yeah.  So they have the pressure.  They still have the pressure of trying to get that info.  And the club card is used for marketing.  They know what you buy with it so then they can target...  And sell that.  ...specifically on the products that you buy with mailers and email crap and shit like that. 
[01:30:30]  It's just a better way for them to focus their advertising so they're not wasting money just advertising, you know, fucking kayaks to 90-year-old people.  Well, I don't think you can buy a kayak at CVS.  I have.  This guy used to work retail.  Cody in Indiana.  How are you, Cody?  Are you the Cody from Indiana?  I am the Cody from Indiana.  I feel privileged today. 
[01:31:00]  How are you, Cody?  I'm great, sir.  Thank you.  So, Jimmy, I am planning on going to one of your zaniest comedy shows in Vernon Hills or, what is it, St. Charles, Illinois in March.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I'm returning to the Chicago area.  Good, Cody.  Tickets go on sale today, fuckers.  Do they really?  Thanks.  I didn't know that.  Wow, what the fuck?  Anyway.  I'm an idiot.  I used to work retail.  And the, much like the guy said, they make you sell magazines or they make you keep up a certain item per sale ratio and they ask you to do several things. 
[01:31:30]  And the only perk is not kickback money if you keep your job.  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay.  See you in March, buddy.  Bye.  Thanks, man.  I didn't, most importantly, I don't know my own schedule.  And finally, Mike at PA before the break here.  Mike, how are you?  Mike!  What up?  Mike!  Hey, when I'm in line and there's a dope to ask me for my information, I give you my address. 
[01:32:00]  It says 1313 Mockingbird Lane.  Ah.  My phone number is 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Yes.  Nice.  I just don't, that's such an easier way to do it.  I just, it annoys me so much that they're trying to be that invasive for advertising purposes.  That is fucking enraging.  I was right there with that enraging word.  Yeah, I'm here buying your shit.  Already, I'm in here buying.  Yeah, I'm in here.  Let's not worry about the next time I'm in here buying your shit. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  I'm buying shit right now from your stupid store.  Right.  You're getting nothing from me.  And then you don't know where all that shit goes because a lot of these places have deals with other databases and stuff.  And then you wind up being sold, your information gets sold to some fucking database that they just kind of, other companies can pick and choose from based on demographic.  So now you're getting junk mail from shit you didn't even fucking know about. 
[01:33:00]  American Express, they don't sell your information, right?  I don't think so.  Okay.  All right, quick sports report before we go to break.  In football, the Cardinals beat the Saints, the Ravens beat the Colts, the Vikings beat the Cowboys, and the Jets beat the Chargers.  So that's your update on the NFL.  We'll be right back.  Hopey.  What?  I didn't see the games.  You think your Cowboys are going to beat the Vikings this weekend?  I know they are.  How do you know that?  Because I was injured. 
[01:33:30]  What, do you got a fucking crystal ball?  No, I got two of them.  I've been made out of crystals, like salt and stuff.  Opie and Anthony, help me, help me, help me, help me.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.E.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.E.U.s.  You have nine new voice messages.  First voice message.

Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  So what's David Blaine doing? 
[01:36:00]  David Blaine is staying up in Times Square.  Forget this.  72 hours to help Haiti.  You just did that.  But you didn't help Haiti.  No, no.  That was a coke bender.  Yeah.  Of course.  I haven't done cocaine in fucking hours.  No.  Years.  Used to like doing a little dude back in the 80s when everybody else did. 
[01:36:30]  So David Blaine is going to stay awake for three days.  For three days.  He's going to be in Times Square doing magical tricks.  Doing his magical tricks to help Haiti.  Yes.  The man is superhuman.  No, he isn't.  He certainly is.  He's a demon.  No.  A demon.  72 consecutive hours without catching any Z's.  The man is godlike.  No, he can't be godlike.  Anyone can stay up for 72 hours. 
[01:37:00]  What's the longest you've stayed up?  Six hours and 27 minutes.  And then I fall asleep.  I'm narcoleptic.  Oh, we didn't know that about that.  Yes, I am.  Sometimes I'll be talking.  And I'll go, I think the answer is...  Do you have sleep apnea, too?  Yes, I do.  That's why I can't drive.  I drive in 10-foot increments.  10-foot increments.  I pull over and nap.  That would be...  Takes me a long time.  I always leave.  Fucking this.  David Blaine and the media all over it.  I mean, obviously for a good cause, but very self-serving on his part. 
[01:37:30]  Knowing...  He figured a way to get back into the media spotlight after that last disaster.  What was the last disaster?  Sam was part of that one.  Yeah, that was when he was hanging upside down.  Oh, right.  Taking breaks every 20 minutes or something?  Yeah, every 20 to 25 minutes.  He was getting flipped over and hanging out in a cherry picker.  He's constantly, like, cheating on his tricks.  Knowing him with this one, it's 72 hours, but he'll take a sleep break every five hours.  That will last an hour. 
[01:38:00]  We haven't heard from David Blaine since he was hanging upside down.  But now, I mean, you go...  But then you say, look, it's for Haiti, it's a good cause, and now the media's like, oh, okay.  Even though we now know he's a hack, we have to go with this.  Oh, yeah.  It's raising money for those poor people down there.  When he was trying to do the big finish at the end, it just didn't work out at all because  nobody knew.  He jumped off, and then a cable picked him up.  He was supposed to disappear in midair, and he just didn't.  They just watched him float away.  He didn't disappear in midair.  Wait, he didn't?  No, of course not.  The grand finale was a complete disaster. 
[01:38:30]  You don't remember all this?  No, he killed him.  Sam was down there.  You got to interview David Blaine, right?  Yeah, I asked him why they call him the mind freak.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He didn't like that too much.  No.  But they finally exposed him for being the hack that he really is.  I mean, when he does that street stuff, it's kind of cool to watch, but these big,  over-the-top stunts, you know, they were all a joke.  They were all stuff that hacky morning zoo radio shows were doing years and years ago.  Gregory, the man floats in midair.  He's a wizard. 
[01:39:00]  He's not a wizard.  He certainly does.  I watched him float.  I laid underneath him for hours.  He floated above me, I think.  How do you know?  You might have been asleep.  I think you were dreaming that.  I think I perhaps was.  I had on a wizard hat, and he floated above me.  We cast his spells.  I think that's real.  What were you practicing?  Wizardry.  I want to be a wizard.  A big wizard.  People always said,  Tanny, you're going to announce to nothing.  I said, I'm going to be a wizard and cast a spell on you. 
[01:39:30]  Then they would punch my face.  Do you wear a mask when you sleep there, Ted, for your sleep apnea?  Yes, I do.  I wear one of those masks I used to wear in World War II,  but sometimes I close it and I can't breathe at all.  I forget to leave it open.  I'm gasping for air.  Chris S. from Indiana.  This is worth taking a peek.  Chris Rock does a great bit about the trickless magician.  Do a trick, motherfucker.  If it's short and worth playing, 
[01:40:00]  can we maybe play that today for everybody?  Now that we're talking about David Blaine and his wizardry.  72 hours awake.  That's crazy, isn't it?  That's just nuts.  Doing a little magic.  Half our audience is going to do that starting tonight.  They sleep during the show, so it's okay.  No!  No, they don't.  Of course they are.  Of course.  We really got to figure out this Leno thing, man.  Do we do it or not?  It's a big spot for us.  And it ties us into this big thing that is happening with the late night wars. 
[01:40:30]  Be me, me, me, me.  You, you, you, you.  Me, me, me.  You, you, you.  You, you, you.  See, my bits are for 10 people, but they appreciate those 10 people.  Fucking.  I don't know.  Should we?  I don't know.  But I don't like flying.  What do we got?  Bobo!  Yeah.  We got a conclusion to the latest Bobo saga.  Bobo was booked to do a gig at a frat house in Buffalo on the South Campus, 
[01:41:00]  which is not a good place to be.  Now, in Buffalo, I'm hearing, at this particular college.  Was it Buff State or Buff?  University.  University of Buffalo.  At least he got a great deal, though, what I heard.  He had to pay for his own travel.  True.  He got $100.  Yeah.  And had to do...  And he would get $5 per ticket sold.  $5 per ticket sold, so I'd love to know how many tickets were sold.  Generally speaking, frat houses don't have tickets.  Right.  That wasn't a good deal. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, literal Jimmy.  The one thing I want to say, some motherfucker out there really fucked with Bobo.  Yeah.  We fuck with Bobo.  Or, you know...  But he's our Bobo.  He's our Bobo.  He's our Bobo.  Exactly.  We don't fuck with Bobo.  We're about to fuck with Bobo to give you guys good radio.  And we do give him a life, because his life sucked until we started, like, really making  fun of him.  But he doesn't need...  And now it's our pledges.  Only we could do that to our pledges.  Yeah.  That's right. 
[01:42:00]  But that's true.  Yes.  He doesn't need some guy in Buffalo who doesn't put him on a radio show fucking with him.  That's right.  Some chowder head.  A chowder head.  So, of course, when it came down to it, Bobo couldn't get a hold of this guy in Buffalo.  We, uh...  Mersch was going to drive him.  Mersch was going to drive him, but he chronicled the event.  And he showed me the tape of, like, Bobo left this guy, they were at Bobo's house, and  he left him ten voicemails.  Because when it came time to say, well, we've got to call him and get the address, and da-da-da, 
[01:42:30]  get all the info, Bobo had his hair gel in and was ready to go.  Wow.  Had his performance jacket on, and he was ready to...  But, uh...  Poor Bobo.  Yeah, he called, and the guy...  I'm kind of with you today, Jimmy.  I feel bad for him on that one.  He called him what?  The guy stopped answering, so...  The guy didn't even answer the phone.  Bobo left him ten, at least ten that I've heard.  Hello with voicemails.  Um, calling him all kinds of derogatory names.  Then, finally, he called him and left a final voicemail, which was an apology. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, hoping that that would...  And the guy called him back and just said he was just busy.  And that's why he didn't answer the phone.  Who is this asshole?  Some asshole in Buffalo.  Who is this asshole?  He has a Buffalo, uh, area code, so it actually is...  Sorry, phone folks can do that.  Right.  But, uh...  But then, so...  Did you get a montage of Bobo calling this guy?  I hear it's on tape.  Yeah, I mean, the tape's...  Is it worth playing?  The tape's only okay.  It's more the principle of it, like, that he did it.  And then, uh...  Okay.  I found out...  And then Bobo...  Remember when he said his representation called the guy in Buffalo? 
[01:43:30]  Yes.  It was his mom.  His mom was like...  Oh, my God.  Is this thing on or not?  And Bobo goes, yeah, yeah.  He just called and said he was just busy.  Mm-hmm.  And his mom had finally had enough of people messing with their son and said, now you have  to let me talk to him.  And...  And his mom called the guy in Buffalo.  Oh, my God.  So that...  It's kind of depressing.  How did it turn out?  Poorly.  He didn't go.  It didn't happen.  But I...  It didn't happen?  It didn't happen.  And Bobo was very excited. 
[01:44:00]  But I thought he had...  It was his first real gig.  I thought he had, like, five minutes of comedy.  So then Mersch was doing open...  I guess he's an open-miker.  And so he took Bobo to some open mic in the city that evening.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  I was confused.  I thought it had gone down and he did five minutes up there.  So he totally got fucking blown off and moved on by...  No money.  No trip to Buffalo.  No.  Oh.  No headlining gig.  Oh, they told him he was going to headline at a frat house. 
[01:44:30]  Why did Bobo believe this in the first place?  Bobo will believe or repeat whatever he's told.  Trainables will believe anything.  Why would he call up and go...  And think that no one knows him.  Why?  Why do you think?  I don't know.  Why?  Why would he eat pennies and fucking gum and think it's tasty?  I'm stupid for even asking.  He has a couple of donuts short of a donut shelf.  That's what I say.  Where's Ted?  Oh, of course.  Where's Ted?  I don't like that Ted. 
[01:45:00]  Kid whines.  It's a baby.  So the good news, we got Bobo doing five minutes of stand-up.  Yeah.  I mean, hopefully, some of the jokes we heard before when he was on this program sampling  his stand-up.  Yes, which was just amazing.  But that's when he was getting water bottles, newspapers, and shoes thrown in.  And wet paper towels and toilet paper.  If I get a good connection in Atlantic City at the Borgata when I see Jim Norton this weekend,  I'll put up some of that video that I did take of everybody pelting Bobo. 
[01:45:30]  I just haven't had time to get it up there yet.  Poor Bobo.  It's pretty good.  Unfortunately, I missed Anthony's shot when he really hit him really fucking hard in the  nose with a bottle or something.  Yeah, I clocked him a good one.  And I just wasn't rolling at that point.  But I think we got enough footage to go with.  But then when I threw the water on him, and then my favorite, actually, was when Sam poured  the bottle of water on his crotch and made it.  He then had to walk around the rest of the day looking like he pissed himself.  I should have a fan bring me out tonight. 
[01:46:00]  I should do that.  If one of our good fans is down here, I think Bobo won't be there or Big A or any of those  guys.  I'm sure there'll be a lot of fans, though.  Yeah, I'd like to do that.  There'll be somebody that'll...  Yeah, but one of the ones we know.  Yeah, you'll figure out something.  I just can't wait to sit down and play blackjack with fans.  Really?  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Hey, Anthony, sit down and watch him fuck me up.  By hitting on something he shouldn't. 
[01:46:30]  Did he do show references and stuff?  Yeah, the whole time.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, right?  Well, the guy will have a 10 and he'll get blackjack and he'll go, well, it looks like  I have blackjack.  Oh, look, he's trying to get on the show.  Hey, don't talk about this on your show when you get back.  I don't want it to be material for your show.  You won't be.  Don't worry about it.  Every time that you lose, he'll point out, that's a car crash for you, Anthony.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, jeez. 
[01:47:00]  You just lost so much.  I would buy it.  That's like a year's salary for me.  You lose, you get nothing.  Good day, sir.  Oh, and Danny knows how great I handle a loss.  I will fucking kill him.  You know what I'm thinking?  You love...  Before you spit all over the place.  I will spit on the...  Punch things.  I know, I'm terrible.  I'm thinking this.  You're such a big fan of Chip Chipperson.  I pray that he sits right next to you and plays blackjack.  I hope so, too.  I would love to have Chip just harass the dealer all night long. 
[01:47:30]  I play good blackjack.  Yeah?  Sure, I do.  I hit on everything because I feel like the odds are in my favor.  So what if you have 20?  No, I won't hit on a 20, but you give me a 17.  The odds of getting a four are good.  I'm really good.  Nice.  I make jokes to Queens.  Whatever.  I make everybody laugh at the table.  I crack them up.  What's like one of your jokes?  You're sitting there.  You're dealt a pair of Queens.  The deal's got a four show and go.  Hey, who are these two ladies?  What are they doing around here? 
[01:48:00]  Please play with Anthony.  And then he'll see it my way out.  Hey, these two ladies.  Yeah, look at them.  They're hoping for a couple of kings to take them for a night out of town or something.  Oh, good.  I want to play with you, Chip.  I play very good.  Yeah?  My mother doesn't like me gambling, though.  Why's that?  I don't know.  That woman's a saint.  She's a beautiful woman.  All right.  Chip really likes his mom a lot.  Fluxuous.  A little too much.  Yeah.  We were talking about Bobo when he's on the line. 
[01:48:30]  Bobo!  Yeah, I'm on the line right now.  I'm downstairs.  Sam asked me if I was going to be showing up today.  But, unfortunately, they don't even have my name in the system.  Oh, boy.  I told Carleese he was coming.  His name's not in the system.  Not good.  We should get Bobo.  All right.  We'll get you up here.  We'll get you up here, Bobo.  All right.  Have him try again.  Oh, try again.  Your name's in the system now.  Yeah.  Do it live on the show.  Go ahead.  This will be exciting.  Yeah, they put it in.  With your static phone.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Go.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm at the desk.  It's my Daniel Carlin.  Carlin, K-U-R-L-A-N.  Daniel Carlin.  How's it going, Bobo?  I'm sitting here right now.  They've already got guns taken care of.  Did you get your little sticky badge?  No, I don't have any bag on me. 
[01:49:30]  No, your sticky badge that they give you.  No, your sticky bag.  Your sticky bag.  You know, I was talking to the security guy.  I was asking if I had any bags on me.  Ashton from Bayshore goes, Daniel Carlin.  That's I-D-I-O-T.  But as you speak right now, I'm at the elevator thing, waiting for the elevator.  All right.  All right.  We'll stay in a little bit.  I want you to introduce yourself to whoever's on the elevator. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you do that?  Tell them you're Bobo from the opening.  There's a big buzz that you're coming up today.  Yeah.  Is there anybody near you, near the elevator banks that you could talk to right now?  No, not at the moment.  They're all intimidated by you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just want to hear his phone go dead when he goes in the elevator.  I do, too, because it plummets from the basement.  You just hear a cable snap.  Yeah, like the fucking, like, the almond chill.  He would walk away from the record.  Oh, he would.  Like, nothing happened.  The elevator plummeted. 
[01:50:30]  I'm sorry.  What?  What?  Are you alone?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  There it is.  Yeah.  You'll hear a high-pitched whine, which means the nuclear device has gone off.  Nothing kills it.  But if he was in Haiti right now, he'd still be babbling in people.  And then I was supposed to go to Buffalo.  Why does the man keep talking?  Nobody wants to hear the story.  There's people dying here, man.  Things are sad here.  You're babbling about nothing. 
[01:51:00]  I was going to go to Buffalo, and then I was going to perform.  But the guy told me, I understand what everybody here is feeling.  You don't understand nothing.  I saw a person under a rock.  Did you?  Well, what did you do to help of you just talking?  The man put the rock on himself so him didn't have to hear you.  So him didn't have to hear you.  Oh, what a dolt. 
[01:51:30]  So we got Bobo at a comedy club.  Yeah.  He got five minutes on stage.  Okay.  How many people were there?  Well, judging by, I didn't see a crowd shot, but judging by the reaction, I'd say maybe a baker's dozen.  Probably more like five or six.  All right.  This is going to be uncomfortable.  Five or six what?  Baker's dozen?  No, I was going to say baker's dozen, but it didn't sound like it.  You did say baker's dozen, Dad.  So basically, that's 13 people.  No, I know, but then I thought it didn't really sound like 13 people. 
[01:52:00]  Basically, Bobo performed in front of more people in studio when we were helping him out.  Yeah, I would think so.  At his actual gig at an open mic club.  Yeah.  All right, let's see how it went down here.  Oh, my God.  I don't know how much we're going to be able to take of this.  Oh, no.  It is five minutes.  Yeah.  Keep it going for your new screen.  Give it up for Bobo, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  If you've been in New York, Manhattan, whatever you call it, I'd like to say I've been through 
[01:52:30]  so many surgeries because of this damn dick problem I was born with.  There was something wrong with my urethra when I was very little.  And I just like it's the worst thing when you find out you have to go through surgery.  And I've just been 48 of them.  For one thing, you're in this doctor's office, and it's the beginning of the part that really  irritates me.  When they have to check out your junk, they may have pulled on your pants, and they have 
[01:53:00]  to look.  They have to check your junk.  I always hate that.  It's just for sure to think I'm not going to get raped on this one.  They're just staring at her looking.  And then all of a sudden, they're going to be talking to my mother.  Wait, can we do this when he's here so I can tell him a little bit about what he might  be doing wrong?  Like the fact that there's no pause between statements and jokes?  Nothing.  He's running down the hall now.  He just can't.  Look at him go.  Yeah, I'm running.  He's got his O&A shirt on. 
[01:53:30]  Can we put a time limit on this, though?  Yes.  Three minutes.  Three minutes.  For real.  Hi, Bobo.  Bobo.  Hey, Bobo.  I heard the Buffalo thing didn't pan out for you so well, huh?  They did.  They did.  If I run into that guy, I'm going to do the same thing.  First of all, I'm going to use a example of someone else.  I would do the same thing, too.  A while back, I was looking somewhere.  I think it was in a news day, some article about that reservation in Mastic, but he sold 
[01:54:00]  the cigarettes.  Yes.  I think it's the same place where Saul buys his cigarettes.  Saul, right.  Yeah, and there's this picture of this guy.  Ro, Ro, I don't like Christmas shoes.  They hurt my feet.  That's Saul.  Yeah.  There's a picture of this guy dressed in a suit that looks like the cigarette carded, and  this guy looked like, this guy looked so annoying. 
[01:54:30]  If I had, if I just ran in, I feel like just wagging this guy with the baseball bat just  for the heck of it.  Oh, wow.  At least you kept the TV clean with heck.  Yeah.  Just because I think it'd be funny to see this guy just get that crap bee out of him with  the baseball bat.  Now, hold on.  The guy in Buffalo, that's who you're talking about?  Yeah, the same thing.  I feel like doing the same thing to him if I ran into this guy.  Well, who the fuck were you talking about in the first place? 
[01:55:00]  Well, I was saying it was a similar thing I'd do to this other thing I saw, this other  person I saw in the paper.  I'd do the same, I'd do the same thing.  I'd take out a baseball bat, hit, beat the crap out of this guy.  Who are you talking about in the paper?  Yeah, we're very confused.  Well, I said I would do the same, the same thing.  No, no, no, but who are you talking about?  I was talking about this guy.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's two people you want to beat with the  bats, right?  Yeah.  One is the guy in Buffalo that fucked you out of the comedy gig.  Like, who's the other guy? 
[01:55:30]  The other guy is this guy that looks stupid wearing this cigarette suit, like, that looked  like a suit that looked like a cigarette carded.  Yeah.  It was in a newspaper somewhere in, I think, the news day.  Now, why so violent against him?  He didn't do you an injustice like the guy in Buffalo.  Well, this guy just looks a little bit annoying.  Looks too goofy there and that.  So you want to beat him with a bat?  He's got a bad job that he's got to dress like cigarette box?  And you want to beat him up? 
[01:56:00]  No, I don't exactly want to fuck you out of a gig.  No, I don't think we want to beat him up.  I just think it'd be funny if he was.  Oh, OK.  I just think it'd be funny if he just got the crap beat out of him senselessly in his own  piss.  Just because he looks funny?  Just because he looks funny?  Just because he looks annoying, all right?  Wow.  For some reason, this guy looks...  I don't think that should be your theme in life, to beat up people that look annoying.  Yeah.  This guy looks like he'll just try to block your car if you're stopping right past him.  He'll just try to block you. 
[01:56:30]  Bobo.  Holy shit, you're exhausting.  You really are.  Listen to some of your comedy.  We only got like a minute.  You're like watching a video, buffering.  That's correct.  Brian, bear in mind that this room was hard...  There was hardly anybody in this room when I did this.  How many people saw the comedy stylings of Bobo?  Well, I always think there was maybe about three people, and I don't even think they were  really an audience.  They were really just people probably doing the same thing. 
[01:57:00]  Probably there for the open mic night.  Oh, they wanted to perform.  What a nightmare.  Yeah, exactly.  This is going to be a nightmare for comedians.  So this was literally...  I felt like I was literally performing in an empty room.  Well, you were.  Bobo, you have to realize a little criticism.  You just basically started and then rambled.  You have to have punchlines and a little bit of timing, because you just went right up  there, and you're like...  No, because you have to realize nobody knows anything about you at this point.  So you just woke up, my dick surgeries, and my urethra should not be in the first minute 
[01:57:30]  of your set.  People have to know what's going on.  You have to take them through it.  You're assuming that they just hear a guy who they've never...  Can we start that over?  Yeah, you've got to introduce yourself.  Hi, I'm Bobo, and I'm a disaster.  Let me tell you why I'm a disaster.  Little punchlines so they can follow you.  They don't know what's going on.  Let's keep it going for your next meeting.  Give it up for Bobo, everyone.  Good evening, New York, Manhattan, whatever you call it. 
[01:58:00]  I'd like to say I've been through so many surgeries because of this damn dick problem  I was born with.  There was something wrong with my urethra when I was very little.  And I can tell you it's the worst thing.  You find out you have to...  Okay, pause it right there.  Basically, what you're doing is you're just telling the audience that you've had a birth  problem with your genitals, but you're not giving...  Yeah, there's no...  It's kind of brave, though. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, it's great, but you should make it in joke form because you're just basically saying,  I'm tired of all these dick surgeries.  I was born with a urethra problem.  And there's so many doctors and they do this and you're just saying, you know, it sounds  like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, so you're reading it instead of going blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, what should I start with?  Maybe just, you know...  Is your brother raping you?  Yeah.  Talk a little bit about that.  Yeah, give some of your gay experiences.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  That'll perk them up a little bit.  Or I hate the doctor.  I hate the doctor.  You know, I'm talking about the doctor a little bit.  I think you should curse God.  Just curse God.  Yes, look up...  Get up there and just curse God.  Point of heaven and boo.  Yeah.  Or at least, well, the first five minutes, just breathe into the mic like you have a sucking  chest wound like you're doing now.  Well, he ran down the hall.  How about that?  He still hasn't recuperated.  Oh, is that it?  He's going to sprint down the hall.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  You should be able to run down the hall with that.  No, I'm not tired from that.  What are you tired from? 
[01:59:30]  I was up all night all the sneezing.  I was up all night all the sneezing.  We have a real life Saul Rosenberg in our midst.  I was sneezing.  It was tragic.  Why are you sneezing all night?  My Mets hat fell off.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I may have gotten a cold or something.  I don't know.  I was just congested the whole night.  Do you have allergies?  Yeah, I get allergies.  They're mostly seasonal.  Well, that's...  Well, I'm...  What allergies do you get in January when it's two degrees? 
[02:00:00]  Seasonal.  Well, I don't think there was anything seasonal, but...  What about seasonal allergies?  There also sometimes sneeze a lot, but it doesn't happen a lot.  What are you allergic to, Bobo?  That you have seasonal allergies?  Well, there's a lot of...  Well, dust.  Dust.  And certain...  Like certain pollen, like the high pollen count.  The high pollen count gets to you?  Yes.  Especially this time of year.  Yeah.  Well, not really this time of year.  This time of year, it's a little bit easier.  But for some reason, I guess maybe I would... 
[02:00:30]  I had a cold or something.  I was sneezing like crazy last night.  Are you sure it's not all your nostril hair?  Because you do have a lot of nostril hair that you don't...  Don't clip.  Yeah, you might want to clip that shit.  I'm sure about that.  I'm sure about that.  He just answers it.  I'm sure about that.  Have you clipped your nostril hair?  Yeah, I did.  I clipped it two days ago, but it grows too quick.  It looks like Pandora in there.  A little avatar joke for everybody.  Oh, Johnny. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, you should have Stephen S. from Bayshore write for you, because he's got some great stuff.  Bobo should say, if you think Haiti's a disaster, you should...  You should have seen my cock at birth.  That would be a good fucking opener right there.  There you go.  Oh.  And Stephen S. is saying, your nose is clogged with zits.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  You like that one?  Write this shit down.  Stephen S. is giving this to you for free.  I actually like that one.  All right.  You want to hear more of his material? 
[02:01:30]  I'd love to.  I want to know about his...  Well, I wasn't sure what to go with, since it was a five-minute thing, so...  There was, like, the half hour I would have done at Buffalo, so I had everything, like, ready for that.  Half hour.  But you're not giving them place to laugh.  You're just talking a lot in a row.  Like, you're not giving...  You're basically just standing there talking, and they're listening.  Like, you have to kind of construct jokes.  Well, should I have been, like, said, like, that I'm annoyed at all these surgeries I've had to go on through?  Yeah, we're just talking about how I've had to go through a lot of surgeries, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Footer wants in.  Uh, Footer.  Hey, man, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, the funny thing is how, Jimmy, you're giving Bobo legitimate, like, comic advice that, like, he's going to take it and tweak it a little bit.  Next thing you know, the guy's going to be fucking touring the world with his comic genius, you know?  I hope so.  How about my cock looks like a half-chewed corn on the cob?  You know, talk about how your penis is a little bit chewed up on the bottom.  Give him a visual.  I get, I get to say that I've, I've been through so many surgeries that my, that my cock looks like a half-chewed cock. 
[02:02:30]  Whatever your word is.  That's better.  That's better.  Footer.  Footer, you got to have an open mind.  I think with just a little tweaking, I think people would actually see Bobo do a few minutes on the stage.  I really know.  You know, don't misunderstand me.  Keep it up.  It's fucking brilliant.  I'm, but I'm sitting here, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking of all the comics that, like, are on that fucking verge that really do just need, like, a Jimmy, or someone to kind of push him to the next level. 
[02:03:00]  And fucking Bobo is just getting his fucking, Jimmy, you're the man.  Thanks, man.  Fucking terrible.  All right, boys.  All right.  Steve from Major, Darth Bobo.  You do.  What are you doing with that breathing?  I am your retard.  What are you doing?  And that was just, that was just me being quiet, breathing through my nose, and I didn't, I couldn't even hear that yet.  I didn't realize I was breathing, I didn't realize it was picking up a breathing that's relatively quiet. 
[02:03:30]  All right, Bobo, let's see what else you did with your five minutes.  My cocks look like a half-chewed cock.  I would laugh at that if I saw Bobo doing that.  That would be a scream.  This guy's a panic.  We're not trying to polish him into the next Seinfeld, people.  Just getting him into a place where maybe he's...  I am your father.  Yes, your mother liked it in the sitter.  She was Jewish, but damn it, she liked it in the sitter and no seats here. 
[02:04:00]  Fuck, I would...  Wow, that's John Vader.  And damn it.  I was like going, no, when she died.  The damn best pizza vas I ever had.  You super palcatine.  You damn tricked me into a scam.  I can't believe I fell for a swindler like you.  Told me I'd find out a way to save her life.  I turned to the...  You told me I'd turn to the dark side.  If I was able to save her life.  But no, you lied. 
[02:04:30]  She still died.  That was when she became a fistable after giving birth to you and your sister.  Wow.  I would have been looking forward to fisting her pussy.  After that, after giving birth to you and your sister.  Hey, listen to the voice.  Listen to the voice.  I would have been looking forward to fisting that damn bitch's pussy.  Pussy damn bitch's pussy.  You got to breathe a little bit.  In between.  All right, add that and now... 
[02:05:00]  Now try it again.  Wow.  Wow.  Darth Bobo, everyone.  Darth Bobo.  Darth Bobo.  It's Darth Vader in Mean Streets.  That's good.  Do you do any other impressions?  I want more Darth Bobo.  Can you start the Darth music up again?  All right, give us a little more Darth Bobo.  Now you got it.  The breathing.  You're talking through your hand now.  He does these impersonations.  I swear.  You would think of it as the real people.  Go ahead, Darth Bobo.  Luke.  I am your father. 
[02:05:30]  And yes, it's right.  You're murdering in a shitter.  You said that already.  New material.  I just had the results in master writing the damn pictures of her.  But David, I can't feel my cock with these robotic hands.  I don't even think I have a cock.  Breathe, breathe.  I think, I think, I think my cock got burned up and it isn't. 
[02:06:00]  And then they're, they're, they're packaging and it's super scammed.  I sound like I got asthma.  Wow.  That is fantastic.  Bobo.  We just gave you a bit for your comedy, uh, routine.  Darth Bobo.  You got to give Darth Bobo.  Darth Bobo would be great. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And now Anthony's right.  And as much as you, people won't be able to understand you in the audience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony's right.  Any other impressions?  Yeah.  Any impressions?  That's a pretty good one.  That's a good one.  What else do you do?  Well, let me see.  I got, I got this one of this guy that always get pissed off every time you don't tip him.  This cab driver.  Well, let's kind of.  No, let's, let's hear it.  Let's play act a little bit.  Who wants to be in a cab with Bobo right now?  I don't.  I'm not very good.  What?  That isn't it?  Eight dollars there, uh.  All right.  Here you go.  He says, oh, no tip. 
[02:07:00]  I says, this is all I got.  Eight dollars is, oh, no, no, no tip.  I'll take a dollar, but I'll be not happy.  Eight dollars is, oh, no, no tip.  Wow.  That sounds like the guy.  That sounds like a cab driver.  Sounds just like him.  Who else do you do?  So you don't tip the guy?  Well, sometimes I tip the guy, but sometimes there are moments where I only got enough for  the ride out there.  And sometimes I only got enough for that ride.  Right.  And it's gotten to the point where they just expect the tip, as you guys had mentioned. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, oh.  They just think you get the tip automatically.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Anthony, Captain Ned in New Hampshire.  Ask him if he could do retard D2.  What else do you do?  What impressions?  Yeah, what else, man?  Some celebrities.  Scooby-Doo-Doo!  Rocky!  Rocky!  Rocky!  It's good.  Rocky!  Do Scooby-Doo doing something?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Rocky! 
[02:08:00]  No, I say...  I get to do this one, that rooster from the Lootie Toot cartoons.  No, I say here, boy, there ain't no chicken.  There ain't no chicken, boy.  That's good.  There ain't no chicken, boy.  That there's a chicken, boy.  You know what?  I think the wheels have fallen off.  I think you've got to go back to...  Sounds like the guy from In the Heat of the Night.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to go back to Darth Bobo, I'm thinking.  That's...  That's...  Here we go.  Yeah, yeah.  New material, though.  New material.  Underpocker, dude. 
[02:08:30]  Where is my porn?  I wanted it a few minutes ago.  Oh, okay.  Do a creeper set up to the light up.  Let me my asthma spray.  Oh, I love it.  I hate this.  This is a new material.  It's not new material.  Anthony's right.  It makes me smell like I got asthma.  Someone says you should do... 
[02:09:00]  Shoot caca.  That's stupid S.  I don't know what I can do with Chewbacca.  God damn it, man.  Shoot caca.  Shoot caca.  Shoot caca.  What is that?  That's shoot caca.  Or chewed caca, sorry.  Chewed caca.  You better stop doing that.  That's the noise you made when your brother was fucking in the ass.  We want chewed caca. 
[02:09:30]  Sounds just like him.  Yeah.  We didn't ask for your first words when you were born.  Do you want to go back to his actual set?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  A second.  And I've been through 48 of them.  For one thing, you're in this doctor's office, and it's the beginning of the part that really 
[02:10:00]  irritates me.  When they have to check out your junk, they may have pulled on your pants, and they have  to look.  They have to check your junk.  I always hate that.  I say, shoot caca.  I'm not going to get raped on this one.  They're just staring at it.  They're looking.  And then, all of a sudden, they're going to be talking to my mother, and then you just  know what they're going to say.  Oh, yeah.  He has to do surgery.  That part scared me.  I'm only afraid of surgery. 
[02:10:30]  I'm only afraid of surgery.  So then I get to...  Now, Bobo, I don't even want to listen to this set, because I think we gave you some  great new stuff.  Yeah, I agree.  You're just rambling.  You fucking go home, and you work on that Darth Bobo.  But I think...  You should make him our project.  Make him where he really is a touring comedian.  He does a giant success.  Well, he's got a niche.  He could do one of those niche comics that people actually go and see.  Not only that, I thought of a new name.  Now, every time I attack the virus, I'm going by the AIDS. 
[02:11:00]  Are you going to be in Atlantic City this weekend?  No, I'm not.  I didn't make any plans to be there this weekend.  Well, could you get on a bunch of trains and buses and maybe hitchhike, go down to Atlantic  City, intro, Jimmy?  You're not going to have a room or nothing.  And then you just take a bunch of buses, trains, and hitchhike back to Queens?  Jimmy would appreciate it.  If I can figure out a way to get there, I've got to look up how much it cost and everything 
[02:11:30]  for the trip there.  Well, of course.  He would do it for you in a second.  I wouldn't have him just come.  Unless I can get him a room.  I don't know if I can.  Someone's suggesting maybe another movie.  BoboCop?  BoboCop.  Anything from BoboCop?  Yes.  Citizen.  I am RoboCop.  No, you're BoboCop.  BoboCop.  I am BoboCop.  Citizen.  Put down that weapon.  Put down that weapon.  And what is that you're smoking?  I want some of that.  After I arrest you, you tell me where you got some of that stuff. 
[02:12:00]  That is some good joint.  Hey, let's do BoboCop arresting Chukaka.  Oh, good one.  Dude, you freak.  You are under arrest.  This guy is freaking trying to attack me.  Get this guy. 
[02:12:30]  Get this guy before he rapes me.  That sounds like Steve's inner dialogue.  Hey, how you doing, you hot chick?  Hey, you know, I may have gotten injured, but that part managed to survive.  Nice.  You know what?  That's not bad.  You know what?  You know what?  BoboCop.  Anyone else hear it?  Anyone else in this room hear it?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you? 
[02:13:00]  What did the fugitive sound like?  That's an original one.  Let the fugitive sound like.  Let the fugitive sound like.  You know what?  The fugitive thing is done, though, but we could use that voice for something else, I'm  thinking.  Because that is a great voice that you do, Bobo.  That just sounds like every auto-tuned song I freaking hear.  Oh, boy.  Does it?  I get annoyed by those auto-tuned songs.  Let me tell you, auto-tuning, that is not singing.  No.  Anybody can do that. 
[02:13:30]  Sam, can we get him in the studio and do a little auto-tuning?  Yeah.  We're finally on to the auto-tune bit years later.  Years past everyone else doing stuff, we're finally doing auto-tune bits.  What do you want to do on auto-tune, Bobo?  I'm not sure what to do on auto-tune.  We should get something done with him in a studio, auto-tuning Bobo.  Well, I feel like either something by the Black Eyed Peas or a Miley Cyrus.  Oh, you want him to sing or you want him to do, like, kind of something?  Oh, you should sing.  Yeah.  You should sing?  I think the auto-tune works best singing, because like Bobo says, anybody can be a star. 
[02:14:00]  All right, Bobo, yeah.  Enough with this set.  It's just not working.  And I think we gave you some great shit today.  And I think now we're going to bring you in the studio and do a little auto-tune.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear yourself breathing that time?  He nodded.  Yeah, I heard it a little bit, the breathing through my nose.  Yeah, you're really breathing heavy.  What's going on?  Sinuses?  Yeah, just some sinuses.  That's all that's been going on the past two days. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, why?  Because of, what, allergies?  No, I just got a cold.  I sneeze a lot, but sometimes when I get a cold, it's even worse.  All right.  But there was at one point where it was even worse than it is now.  It was so bad.  There was one time I went through...  How bad?  What?  I went through two boxes of tissues in the same day.  Wow, that's bad.  Good remark.  Wow.  They used to call me Sneezy in middle school.  Oh, wow. 
[02:15:00]  I bet that was just one of the names.  They're also calling you Sleepy because they're falling in.  What else did they call you in school?  Yes.  Like bullies.  What would they call you?  No, I think that's all I remember.  They used to call me...  Yeah?  Just Sneezy?  Yeah, that one.  I used to hate that.  Are you sure that's the fucking...  What were they?  Just dwarves.  The seven dwarves.  Paul wants to do his own Darth Bobo impression.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul. 
[02:15:30]  Luke, I am your daughter.  That guy's just awful.  Yes, you are.  All right.  We're going to auto-tune with Bobo?  Yeah, we're going to find a song that Bobo likes and make him a star.  Oh, I like that.  We're going to get him on Hits One.  All right, Bobo.  You're going to go sing somewhere.  Yeah, go sing a song.  Hopefully, we'll have something for us.  Go process it.  After the break.  Remember when we said that David Blaine's doing his thing and then someone said Chris Rock 
[02:16:00]  does a thing and he's just not doing magic?  Yeah, that trick.  Do a trick.  It's a quick clip.  We'll do this going into break.  We so desperate for entertainment.  Everybody's falling for this magician, David Blaine.  What the fuck is this shit?  Are we so desperate that we fall for a trickless magician?  Where the fuck's the trick?  Cut a lady in half.  Pull a rabbit out a hat.  Do something.  What's his last trick?  I'm in a box and I ain't going to eat. 
[02:16:30]  I'm in a box and I ain't going to eat.  There ain't no trick.  That's called living in the projects.  Busy show today before we all head to Atlantic City to see Jim Norton this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  We got Jim Norton's manager in studio, Jonathan.  We're going to talk to him in a little bit.  He's got to wake up, Jimmy.  He's on L.A. time.  Yes, he is.  But he could tell a story, that's for sure.  He's traveled the world to some very dangerous places. 
[02:17:00]  So we want to get into it with Jonathan.  We love when he comes by.  Detroit?  See you guys.  Jonathan's motto is, if they allow clits, I'm not going there.  Removed with a spade shovel.  He really is insane.  Also, Ian Halpern's about to enter the studio.  But before that, because it's a quickie, you hear about this eight-year-old on the terrorist watch list?  Oh, yeah.  What?  And they interviewed the poor little fucker.  Poor little fucker?  What did he do to get on the list? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, it's true.  A rotten kid.  Let's find out.  It's a quickie before Ian Halpern.  And Ian's got some dirt on Tiger Woods, for real.  So we're going to get into that and see if we can make international headlines.  Mikey's name is not on the no-fly list, but apparently it is on the larger so-called selectee list,  which sets off a high level of security screening.  Mikey's mother says it's happened to the boy since he was two.  You could have seen that he was two, and he was three, and he was four, and he was five. 
[02:18:00]  But now it's scary, because he's eight.  And what happens when he's 16?  Why would a kid be a terrorist?  Why would a kid be a terrorist?  That's what everybody's wondering.  Poor little kid.  But they can't figure this shit out.  I know.  We're like broken records.  We've talked about this.  Well, I say it's the parents.  I mean, if the kid has a problem at that age, that's just bad parenting.  I mean, obviously he's a very bad little boy. 
[02:18:30]  A little eight-year-old jihadist.  I don't bring weapons on the plane, because I'm not supposed to.  Who's Tony?  He's the little jihadist who lives in my mouth.  And when do you think maybe we should take Danny to a mosque?  Oh, he's reading, uh, all jihad and no plane makes Jack a dull boy.  Oh, shit. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, this, uh, obviously, uh, a little mistake.  Why can't they fix that?  And, uh, maybe instead of frisking this little bastard every time he goes through, uh, security,  getting the guy with the exploding underwear.  Yeah.  Who was on the list.  Yeah, of course.  And they did nothing with him.  Yeah.  Mikey's name is not on the no-fly list, but apparently it is on the larger so-called selectee list,  which sets off a high level of security screening. 
[02:19:30]  Mikey's mother says it's happened to the boy since he was two.  You could have seen that he was two, and he was three, and he was four, and he was five.  But now, now it's scary, because he's eight.  And what happens when he's 16?  Why would a kid be a tourist?  A terrorist?  Why would a kid be a terrorist?  That's what everybody's wondering.  Sounds like a very bad boy.  Is that the same clip?  That was the same clip.  Yes, it was.  Twice.  Yeah.  It was, right?  Yes, it was.  Wait, who did that?  I thought I was having deja vu. 
[02:20:00]  I thought you did that on purpose.  Who made that clip?  No.  That was the same exact clip, right?  Yes.  That's weird.  I don't know what to do.  Unless maybe I didn't, uh...  Did we play the clip where he doesn't like being touched?  His name's Mikey.  Maybe it's the, uh, Pop Rocks and Soda, Mikey.  And that could explode.  I hope you don't play that clip.  You don't know that.  Did you hear this clip?  Boo.  This is the face of evil, or so you might think, by the way he's questioned and patted down  before he boards an airliner.  I don't like getting, like, like, touched in, like, certain spots. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah?  They touch you in certain spots?  Yeah, they go, like, like that way.  He's Michael W. Hicks, an eight-year-old Cub Scout who may not look like a terrorist,  but he gets the terrorist screening treatment every time he flies with his parents,  because his name, apparently the same as someone else, is on the list.  Wow, we didn't hear that one, right?  Michael Hicks doesn't sound like a terrorist.  No, not at all.  I'll tell you the truth.  Even the guy that his name is like, that's on the list, probably shouldn't be on the list. 
[02:21:00]  You know.  He's on, like, a no-fly bigger list.  He's probably, like, a drunk guy who got drunk and fucking was an asshole one day.  I could see if his name was, like, Bill Lawden.  Bill.  Bill Lawden.  Just to throw us off.  Just to throw us off a little bit.  Omar William Lawden.  All right.  Al Zarcawi.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Or, um, um, just, you don't know a whole lot of them. 
[02:21:30]  Or, uh, or, uh, little Petey Achman Dinajad.  Yeah, just one of those dumb stories.  Sucks for that family.  Hey, why don't we get Ian Halpern in here?  He's going to admit that he had sex with Tiger Woods, I think.  And we have audio.  And we have audio of him, what?  He had sex with Tiger Woods?  Yes, he did.  Yeah, I think so.  That's a scoop.  Yeah, here comes Ian Halpern.  Ian Halpern, everyone.  There he is. 
[02:22:00]  Hello.  How you doing?  How you been, sir?  So, it's true you had, uh, sex with Tiger Woods.  Tell us about it.  Man.  Yeah.  Everyone is fucking calling me for the Tiger Woods story.  Because it, look, I fucked up, man.  A chick came with me with a tape two years ago.  Yeah.  I refused to do the book.  Every publisher knows.  They leaked it out.  Still, about three and a half weeks ago, my agent gets a call offering me almost seven figures  to fucking crash out a Tiger Woods book. 
[02:22:30]  I'm under contract with a publisher.  I can't.  You know, you can't do that.  So, every motherfucker has been calling me, stalking me.  Everyone from all the tabloids, the Inquirer people, Us Weekly, Uh, InTouch, all of these,  they've been calling me.  You guys haven't called.  You guys have been the nicest to me.  So, I'm here.  I'm giving it to you guys exclusively.  Fuck the rest of them.  Nice.  What?  What?  What?  What?  That's very cool.  So, you're under contract to do another book.  So, you can't just break that.  I fucked up, man.  I missed the boat on this story. 
[02:23:00]  Seriously, I'd be on a boat with fucking ten chicks from Montreal now.  And they'd be fucking licking my toenails right now.  It's not that big a story.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Oh, yeah, no, it is.  Oh, literal Jim.  So, what's the exclusive on Tiger Woods?  All right.  Look, Opie, the bottom line is here.  In 202, I wrote a book.  See, I do undercover shit.  It won book of the year.  I went undercover as a male model.  I know it's hard to believe, but...  No, really.  And I infiltrated the fashion industry.  It was called Bad and Beautiful.  So, there's one chick, this model, who cooperated with me. 
[02:23:30]  Man, I have a rough voice.  I was singing karaoke here.  I just got in yesterday.  I was singing karaoke at 3.30 in the morning.  You sound good.  Yeah, I'm okay?  I sound like Leonard Cohen today.  Karaoke always goes to like 3.30 in the morning.  Man.  Is Jill Nicolini below that table, by the way?  Where is she today?  Wow, look at you.  You've been keeping in touch.  So, bottom line is here, that this chick, who cooperated with me for the Bad and Beautiful, 
[02:24:00]  her and her manager approached me two years ago.  They play me the tape, and I'm going to tell you the contents of the tape today.  Okay.  And I didn't think it had legs.  I fucking missed the boat.  Plain and simple.  I fucked up.  You saw an alleged sex tape that starred Tiger Woods?  And she's peddling it right now.  This is in the news.  I have heard the tape before anyone else two years ago.  The publishers know this because, look, I spoke to a few publishers.  They missed the boat, too.  They said, I don't think this has legs. 
[02:24:30]  Like, come on, man.  If I would have done the book, it would have come out just about now.  Wow.  And so this, you know, whatever.  I'm not looking back.  But here, look, bottom line, Tiger's nickname, I'm telling you right now, on the sex tape,  she calls him Lazy Dog.  Lazy Dog.  Lazy Dog.  The whole tape.  Why is that?  I have no idea.  Figure it out.  Lazy Dog.  Lazy Dog.  That's Tiger's nickname.  Wow.  I would speculate that that would probably be somebody that likes to just kind of kick 
[02:25:00]  back and let someone else do the work.  That's what I would think.  Yeah.  You know, what's your take on this?  It's also called a guy.  Lazy Dog.  If I would use that in a BDSM situation where I was getting spit in my face, being called  a Lazy Dog, and then she'd take something that looked like a dick and pretend it was a tail  and shove it in my hiney.  And that's just me talking.  That's my guess.  Now, I want to set the ground rules here today because I know all the fucking journalists  listening, look, this is it. 
[02:25:30]  This is the only fucking interview I'm doing on this.  It's right here.  Nobody fucking call my agent again.  He's been bombarded the last month.  Look, you guys didn't even call, but you guys have been the nicest to me.  So I said, I'm only doing it on your show, but nobody fucking call me again.  I'm working on a new book, a TV show.  I have no fucking time to talk about Tiger Woods and make me weep.  I miss the boat, man.  So do you think this is real, this sex tape?  A hundred percent, because the reason why I know it's real, the voice matches Tiger's, 
[02:26:00]  and she's peddling it right now.  That's made news.  What do you hear on the tape?  Because you didn't see the tape.  You heard the entire sex tape with Tiger Woods.  Yeah, I sat down with her and her manager for about an hour and a half.  Why wouldn't they show it to you?  Why wouldn't they show you the video?  They only wanted to play me audio.  I wonder if they were you had a hidden camera or something like that.  They might have been, were they worried that you might have filmed it secretly and then  fucked them?  Well, I don't know.  They didn't say that.  But the ground rules will only play you the audio.  Okay.  All right.  No stills or anything, huh? 
[02:26:30]  He talks about his wife.  He alludes to the fact, look, things weren't peachy keen with her and keep it quiet.  And he talks about snow jobs.  Do you know what snow jobs are?  Like snowballing?  Is that, is a snow job?  I think it's like a Kamasutra position.  Oh, okay.  It's like some sexual position, snow jobbing.  I always thought it had something to do with sucking semen out.  Like snowballing is when, when one girl takes semen and they make out.  You learned that from clerks. 
[02:27:00]  No, I didn't actually.  But I mean, please, I learned that from life.  That's what I always thought that was.  And she said she partied hard with him.  So, you know, Tiger, what does party hard mean?  She said there were drugs, alcohol.  He's a party animal.  That's what she claimed.  So now when, when do you, did she film this or is she claiming that she filmed it secretly  or covertly?  Or did she film it in a way where it was held by him and his cock is just showing on his face? 
[02:27:30]  I always wondered why would a guy of that, if that tape is real, why would you allow that  to be shot?  She says she shot it for her insurance because she was worried that the wife might come after  her if the wife found out.  That's bullshit.  Do you think she was shooting it just to blackmail him someday?  Of course.  Get something out of it.  Well, she's going to cash out now.  Sure.  I mean, that tape is circulating and being pitched to all the networks.  What do you think she'll get for it?  A couple million.  20 bucks.  A couple million?  Oh, yeah, man. 
[02:28:00]  Who's not going to watch that?  Wow.  Tiger Woods being called Lazy Dog.  Wow.  And it was shot a couple years ago and she was just holding on to it.  I wonder, did she say that, do you think she was getting money from him?  Because people said that he was paying out a lot of money.  Yeah.  Do you think she was getting money from him to kind of keep that tape quiet?  Well, for some reason it was kept quiet.  She was a reputable model a few years ago and she used to hang out with like the jet set  crowd, like Carla Brunis of the world who's married to Sarkozy now and all these chicks 
[02:28:30]  who would, you know, a lot of these chicks, she was one chick in my book who, there's a  chapter, I have all these rich Arab sheiks hiring these hot supermodels to go on their  boats in Arab countries and they'd pay them like 50,000 bucks for like five days.  A lot of these top supermodels would do that.  I don't know about Jill Nicolini, how much you paid her, but seriously, like, you know. 
[02:29:00]  Pay someone else did.  Man, but, you know, I'm just saying, chicks like that, they go on these boats and they're  hired help for a week and they're given a suitcase of cash at the end, but they have  to do everything.  Yeah.  Sexual favors.  And I outlined this all in my book.  She was one of those chicks.  But she was smart enough to video Tiger.  Wow.  Now, what's one of the most outrageous things that you hear Tiger saying or doing on this  tape?  He just says he wants to do snow job. 
[02:29:30]  Over and over.  Snow job.  See, I don't even know what that is.  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe some of your listeners do.  Maybe some of your listeners.  Now, by the way, is that a flip camera there?  How fucking, yeah.  Man, those are awesome.  I went undercover a couple of months ago in a psychiatric institution in L.A.  They saw them on my cell phone because those weren't popular yet a few months ago.  No, they're all over the place now.  Yeah, they're so oversaturated.  But I'm like this the whole time.  They think I'm on my cell phone and I'm shooting in the whole fucking place. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  It does look like, it looks like a phone, right?  They're great.  They're 200 bucks, man.  Yeah.  HD.  I want, um, so does she say that she sees, I mean, you could see Tiger in the sex tape?  Oh, you hear his voice over and over.  I didn't see.  No, but did she tell you you could actually see Tiger?  Yes.  Because, okay.  Because people have been trying to figure out if the tape is for real.  Because we have been hearing about this tape for years.  And they're banging.  For a month or so.  They're banging.  So there's no doubt.  You hear sexual sounds.  You hear it all.  There's no doubt in her mind that she's banging Tiger Woods and she's got it on video and you 
[02:30:30]  could tell it's, uh, Tiger Woods.  Well, 100% the voice was his unless, uh, you know, this was all staged with some impersonator.  But no, it was him.  You know, if you listen to, uh, I've heard Tiger Woods in other interviews and 100% the voice  was his.  And I imagine if it's true and it comes out, he'll admit that it was him because to  lie about it at this point would be even a bigger disaster public relations move.  So if it's him and it comes out, he'll probably admit it.  Yeah.  And he was saying shit like, you know, I'm going to leave my wife for you. 
[02:31:00]  Like, I mean, this guy obviously had gift of the gap.  It seemed like he would tell chicks anything to bang them.  And then renege.  We have our first, uh, definition of snow.  What do you say?  Snow job.  Snow job.  Okay.  It's all right.  This makes sense.  Logan in Virginia.  Hey, how you doing?  A snow job is a blow job with ice in your mouth.  Ah, okay.  Yeah.  You know, we learned that, uh, years ago from what?  Laura Korn where, you know, you put some, uh, the girl, the girl puts, uh, some ice 
[02:31:30]  in her mouth and she blows a little bit.  Then she drinks a little hot tea and goes, uh, now hot, hot and cold, hot and cold, hot  and cold.  Actually, they're not supposed to have the ice in their mouth when they do it.  Oh, true.  They just cool their mouth off and then, like, spit the ice into a cup and then, and then  suck your dick.  Can I ask, how is that legal to, and I know certain states have different rules on that,  how is it legal to, to, to tape someone without their knowledge and then sell it sexually?  How, how the fuck a privacy advocate group, instead of harping about, uh, uh, you know, 
[02:32:00]  walking through scanners, why are people not all over this?  Well, that, it's a good question, but now in a lot of the states, you got to sign a release.  And like in California, see, I have a problem when I fill in California cause I go undercover  all the time, but California state law does not let you shoot surreptitiously.  So I got to go undercover and then go to all the subjects and explain what I did and then  get them to sign a release.  It's all fucked up.  What do you do if they don't sign it? 
[02:32:30]  You just can't use the footage.  Okay.  Well, I still use it.  Right.  You know, and then I take the legal risk because then if you, them calling you a liar might  have a bigger, a worse implication than actually the shit you'd take from using the footage.  Yeah.  Well, I'll go to them and I'll tell them and I'll say, look, if you don't sign it, I'm  using it anyhow.  There's no fucking way.  I don't care if people see me, you know, because I'm in Canada.  They can't find me in the woods, you know, like, you know, by the way, Brad Pitt's  been looking for me, apparently.  No, no joke.  I'll tell you right now.  Well, you wrote the book. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I wrote the book.  He's a bit pissed off because, you know, I said a lot of derogatory things to his partner,  Jolie.  Look, I'm telling Pitt right now if he's listening to this or if Pitt's friends are listening,  because all of Pitt's friends cooperated with me.  I'm going to settle this with Pitt one-on-one.  I'm going to rent out Port Authority.  I'm going to put a boxing ring in there.  I'm serious, man.  I'm going to duke it out with him the old way.  If he really wants to do this man-o-man-o, I'm in.  I'm going to, I want to duke it out with Pitt.  I don't see Pitt signing up for that. 
[02:33:30]  Well, apparently he wants to kill me.  He's so pissed off at me.  And what part?  That's what his friends said.  What part really got to him?  All the shit I was saying about him smoking pot, he didn't want that out as grass.  I mean, it's all out.  You know, I've called him a white Rastas farian in a lot of interviews I've done.  Look, the guy, basically, I say, likes pussy and pot.  He sits in his room all day, smoking pot, listening to reggae.  You see the way he's dressed recently?  He looks like a white Rasta man.  He's trying to imitate Bob Marley or something. 
[02:34:00]  Peter Tosh, all those guys.  There has to be something legitimate to all this stuff.  Otherwise, no one would publish these books.  If these were like just complete falsehoods, no publisher would do it and no insurer would cover it.  Look, I back up everything I say.  Look, all kidding aside, I've been doing this.  I have 14 books out.  They've all been bestsellers.  Bottom line is, push comes to shove.  I video every fucking thing.  I wait for them to come after me and then I make them look like idiots.  And why isn't Pitt suing me?  Right.  Well, you know, he says he wants to come after me, beat the crap out of me, whatever. 
[02:34:30]  I'm willing to duke it out with him, man.  If he, that's the line I heard from one of his friends.  He said, dude, if this guy sees you, he's going to punch you in the face.  I said, look, let's settle it, man.  You want to go?  I can handle myself.  You know, I've trained in martial arts up in Canada.  Ah.  Can you show us a move?  Well, you know, it's a bit of, I told you, I was karaokeing all night.  But, you know, if, put it this way, if Jesse Ventura was here, I'd fucking put his head  through the glass right now.  He doesn't scare the shit.  This guy handled Ventura. 
[02:35:00]  That's all over YouTube, that shit.  Yeah.  Like, it's one of the most popular clips circulating on YouTube.  Yeah, it did pretty well.  It did pretty well.  You got like a few hundred thousand hits or something.  I'm about a Ventura's an ass.  And people say, who's that?  Look, this small guy stands up to that idiot Ventura, that right-wing fucking motherfucking  idiot.  Is he a right-winger?  I would call him an extreme left-winger, actually.  Oh, he's really right-wing.  He's just an act.  He's like a libertarian, but.  Yeah, he's a weird, he's a hard one to pin down, because he's four, he's like, very much 
[02:35:30]  agrees with you on gun control, the Second Amendment.  He's a very big NRA type guy.  Yeah.  But he's also, he's weird.  He's radical in a lot of directions.  Man, I wish he was in Haiti when that whole thing exploded.  I felt bad for all those people.  But if he would have gone up there and exploded, I would have shed no tears.  I knew not to go.  Yeah.  The HAARP project is what did it.  Yeah.  Right.  Is it?  Didn't you wonder what the Republicans were doing before Haiti?  No, we didn't.  There were people doing work in Haiti construction.  They were CIA. 
[02:36:00]  I'm a SEAL, I know.  Thermite pumpkin seeds.  Thermite plantains.  Exploding bananas.  Fucking nuts for us.  Let me go to Chris in Missouri.  A lot of people have questions for Ian Halpern.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Remember Ian's first interview?  He talked about maybe Kurt Cobain was not a suicide.  It was a murder.  Can we talk about that some more, please?  No problem, dude.  Have you read my book? 
[02:36:30]  No, I haven't.  Yeah, it's called Love and Death.  It was a New York Times bestseller, and I also wrote another book, Who Killed?  I had a whole franchise here.  I never backed down.  I had a book called Who Killed Kurt Cobain, and I did two films based on the subject.  I worked with Nick Broomfield on Kurt and Courtney, and then I did my own called The Cobain Case,  which was a number that was put out by Paramount, and I released all the secret Cobain tapes in there.  Courtney Love's P.I. showed up in my backyard, and she wanted to kill me, too.  I mean, Courtney Love's a crazy motherfucker. 
[02:37:00]  You know, I'm probably the only guy in this room who hasn't fucked Courtney Love, but, you know, seriously.  But let me tell you something, man.  The bottom line is...  I'm guilty.  Sorry.  70 times a lethal dose of heroin found in his system.  Suicide note, the handwriting didn't match Kurt's.  Today, his own daughter, Frances Bean, is going after Courtney for misappropriating.  40 million bucks from the estate has just vanished. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  And Kurt's mom, Wendy, is claiming that Courtney basically looted Frances out of her money.  40 million.  Has Courtney ever been on this show?  No.  Man, she's crazy.  Never been.  But bottom line is, Seattle police, I went to the homicide sergeant.  His name was Don Cameron.  I walked in there with a film crew, a satchel of files, man.  Huge.  Telling him, dude, look at my fucking files, and you're going to at least reopen this case. 
[02:38:00]  Courtney's P.I., Tom Grant, who she hired to find Kurt after he went missing from an L.A. drug rehab center 10 days before he died.  Today, this guy says 100% his own client murdered Kurt Cobain.  I'm not saying that.  He is.  This is a top Beverly Hills P.I.  So, until this case is at least changed from suicide to undetermined, we have a major problem here.  Will that ever happen, though?  Well, they think he's just another junkie in Seattle killing himself. 
[02:38:30]  And, look, Kurt Cobain, he was a perfect candidate to commit suicide.  He always wrote about suicide.  But I think the key here is going to be Frances Bean.  She's 17 now.  She's woken up.  Smelt the coffee.  She's going after her own mother.  And this could develop into something in the future.  It was a thermite microphone.  Got it.  Look, it took how many years?  28 years for that Kennedy case?  The guy to go behind bars? 
[02:39:00]  Golf club.  Oh, yeah.  And Skakel.  Michael Skakel.  Michael Skakel.  Moxley he killed.  That's right.  Martha Marston.  How do they make it look like he shot himself?  Because, look, with that much heroin in yourself, in your system, you'd be out in a second, let  alone lift a shotgun, position it, and put it in your mouth and shoot it.  But it was perfectly planned that, by the way, Kurt's fingerprints were not found on the  gun.  That's what the police report. 
[02:39:30]  A hundred percent.  I have the report in my book and in my film.  No fingerprints.  Dead men don't wipe their own prints.  Everybody knows there's no way Cobain could have made that shot.  He wasn't even a good marksman in the Marine Corps.  Was he a Navy SEAL?  Yes, he was a marksman, Jesse.  He wasn't a bad shot.  That's what Oliver Stone said.  I know.  How fucking stupid.  He was a marksman.  Now, you guys got to get another microphone in here. 
[02:40:00]  Is Conan going to join the show?  What's he going to be doing next week?  What do you think about the late night wars, Ian?  Well, I think it's, you know, NBC, man.  They got it wrong here.  Look, Leno, the world's had enough of him.  I don't think Conan went to bat and hit a home run here.  The ratings sucked.  I think you guys, they put you guys in this position here with one guest.  You'd kick their asses in ratings.  Just film it right here.  Low budget TV show.  Get Ventura in here with Jimmy here. 
[02:40:30]  Like, it just didn't work.  And he destroyed the legacy.  See, when you go to the plate, as Seinfeld said, you got a hit.  You got a hit.  This guy didn't hit.  And, but who wants to see Leno again?  So this is.  And Letterman, this is the greatest thing.  You know, instead of looking at his cock history now, they're all, they're all, you know,  his ratings gone through the roof.  Everyone's forgotten about his sex scandal.  Who knows?  I think Letterman is probably bummed about this deep down because if he has to, 
[02:41:00]  Leno was beating him very, very handily.  And if he has to, now he has to face, you know, if you're doing well against Conan  and all of a sudden fucking, you know, the guy who was beating him comes back, it just sucks.  You know, he had seven great months.  I'm not saying Letterman's just going to automatically lose, but, you know,  Jay had great success against him.  I shouldn't be bad-mouthing these guys because, again, I can't give you details,  but I'm in L.A. now working on a new TV show, and I'm working with a lot of these guys,  and, hey, I hope they're not listening, but they goofed, these fuckers. 
[02:41:30]  What kind of show?  It's my own show, and it's all about going undercover.  Are we going to be on it?  Of course, man.  You guys, like, look, I'm here today for a reason.  Everyone says, of course.  They always say, of course, and then we never get the fucking phone call.  We never get the plane ticket.  We never get the script.  We never get a ride or anything, an email.  They all go, yeah, yeah, of course.  Well, let's do an episode.  You guys got to let me hang out in your crib 24-7 for one week.  That's the deal.  You can hang out.  There's nothing going on at my place. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, dude, I heard.  Man, publishers have told me about you, dude.  You're like the rock star of the book world.  No, seriously, man.  They've told me about, whoa.  They say this guy has chicks.  He writes about some good shit.  Like, crazy, man.  I did detail my depression, my prostitute phase in my first book.  Yes, I did.  Just a couple of times.  No, really.  But, you know, they goofed.  See, Conan, Leno, they're the Flintstones of TV.  Like, it's old school, man.  You've got to take it, communicate with the new wave, make it multimedia-oriented, not just bring up some stiff on a couch. 
[02:42:30]  You know, people are bored of that.  This is in 1960 here with Jack Barr or whoever.  You've got to take it to the next level.  And as a serious entertainer, you've got to take the old school and, you know, it's like Charlie Parker.  John Coltrane took him to another level that no one could ever imagine.  And Conan wasn't doing that.  And, you know, NBC fucked up.  It's a fiasco. 
[02:43:00]  But at the end of the day, man, Conan, how much is he going to get to pay out here?  Millions?  Everyone's going to do well.  I was going to say, man, just go to Sweden for six years and just chill out.  He'll go to Fox or he'll go to ABC.  He'll do something.  Someone's going to hire Conan.  But why?  With all that cash?  I know.  Like, why would you even consider pitching another show?  He kind of looks bad right now.  Yeah.  He looks like he's kind of a failure.  Because NBC is kind of portraying it that way.  So, of course, he wants to prove everybody wrong.  Yeah, he wants to go out.  What's wrong with you?  He's got so much money. 
[02:43:30]  It's like you make money from your books.  You don't write them just for the money.  Part of it is you want to prove yourself and redo it again.  And I think that's what it is with him, too.  It's like he's got enough money.  He's got fuck you money 50 times over.  But it's like you don't want to be embarrassed.  You know, seven months, he's yanked.  You know, he's embarrassed.  Give us something new today in the pop world.  Something that no one knows yet that might come out.  What are you hearing out there?  Anything good?  A lot of things.  I mean, first of all, I know that Lohan's dating a friend of mine in L.A. now.  Yeah.  And he's enamored with her. 
[02:44:00]  And she's trying to clean up her act.  It's either do or die.  Has Lohan been, like, have you met Lohan?  We met her once at our old studio.  She was waiting for something.  How old do you think she is?  In the picture I have with her, she didn't look particularly great.  But she was unmade up and it was at 8 in the morning.  So it's hard to say.  If she was here today, would you fuck her?  Oh, without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  Jimmy would do it without a bag and everything.  He'd get right in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd tell you.  I'd get right in there.  I'd dive in.  Because he tells me she's so fucking hot. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Who's the guy?  I can't say, man.  Because he'd kill me, man.  What kind of job does he have?  He's an executive.  Okay.  In Hollywood.  And she's really trying to clean up, huh?  Yeah, she's trying to clean up and she's trying to produce some TV shows behind the scenes.  That's not going to give us a headline, though.  You've got to give us something that people are talking about that no one has really hit on you.  All right.  Liza Minnelli.  Liza Minnelli.  She actually died five years ago.  How is that going to get us international fucking...  You have to film this, though.  What if there's a good selfie? 
[02:45:00]  I'm filming the flip camera.  Liza Minnelli.  I'm predicting her and Liz Taylor.  Yeah.  They'll be having dazes growing on top of them within the next 12 months, both of them.  Whoa.  Why is that?  Apparently, they're both just failing.  They're just on the way out.  Both of them.  I'm surprised about Liza Minnelli.  Liz Taylor is ancient, but I'm surprised Liza Minnelli is fucking dead.  Everyone...  I thought Liz Taylor was going like 10, 15 fucking years ago.  She's been dying of the same heart attack for 20 years.  Because of Hyman Roth.  Hyman Roth.  I smoked pot with Liza Minnelli. 
[02:45:30]  A couple of...  Like, undercover.  I went undercover in her trailer.  She smoked so much pot.  Passed me the joint.  I have this.  I had it on YouTube.  They made me take it down.  But she...  Yeah, she likes the weed.  Yeah, she likes the weed, Liza.  A lot.  How about Guest, David Guest?  Was that like a cuckold situation?  You should get him on this show, Guest, and see what really went to her.  I think he'd be...  This guy's just literally disappeared.  Yeah.  I think book David Guest here, get him to open up.  I mean, this guy needs some sort of exposure. 
[02:46:00]  Maybe you could stop...  Maybe...  You know, that was a sham.  The guy's gay.  Of course.  Everyone knew that.  We had Liz Smith, Michael Jackson at the wedding, best man, best woman here, maid of honor,  whatever.  And it was a complete sham.  Well, is Liza...  Why was Liza marrying a guy who's gay then?  Was it to cover her own stuff?  I think Liza's addicted for years and years to black men.  Oh, 100%.  Really?  Oh, she likes...  All right.  She likes African-American men. 
[02:46:30]  Really?  And she just wanted to cover...  Can we have a disclaimer?  No, really.  Someone get a deep point and get us a disclaimer immediately.  No, Liza Minnelli was one of Wilt Chamberlain's 20,000.  That's a thing.  Really?  Can you imagine?  Liza and Wilt.  Liza and Wilt.  Picture that.  The stilt.  You know what?  I don't...  I can't say that's not true.  I mean, look.  I was surprised when Mooney said that Pryor had fucked Barbara Walters.  And then I thought about it and I wasn't surprised.  Man, Barbara Walters. 
[02:47:00]  She likes to get late.  Yeah.  Even today.  What is she?  83 or something?  Yeah, she's up there, yeah.  You know, she's still fucking peddling young guys.  She talks a little saucy on that show.  She likes to talk a little saucy sometimes.  Man, you look at her mouth.  You could tell she sucks so much cock in her time.  Wow.  Barbara Walters.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Never stops moving her mouth.  Really?  It's not.  You know, why don't you guys focus in?  Just take a shot of Barbara Walters' mouth and get a dentist in here.  Because I have a friend who's a specialist dentist. 
[02:47:30]  A prosthodontist.  And he told me he could tell right away when a chick sits on his chair how much cock the chick sucks.  Just based on her lips?  No, by her breath.  If it smells like someone just cleaned the floors with bleach, we have a fucking, we have a fun day here.  We got a picture of Barbara Walters in her mouth.  That's, uh...  What do you see in there, Ian?  Man, I just see a lot of wear and tear.  You know, there's no doubt this chick just likes, you know, just likes to have something to suck on. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, she's skanky Barbara Walters.  It's all fate.  You know, that whole book.  I read her book, man.  She admits to a few things, some infidelity in there.  But if she'd really tell the true story, man, I mean, she's the Hugh Hefner of, you know, her, of the view.  Like, you know, of TV. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  She likes, she has toy boys, I think, all over the place.  And I'm surprised to hear about Liza.  That's, wow.  Yeah, Liza, oh, Google this one.  Liza Minnelli.  She likes it.  She likes Black Minnelli.  So just Google Liza Black Cock.  She likes Cock with a tan.  Let's do Liza Likes and see what Google says.  What's that, John?  Liza and Lamar Odom.  Who's that?  Lamar Odom.  He's the guy that married the Kardashians.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, what's with those Kardashians?  They, you know, they won't date. 
[02:49:00]  What do you got on them?  What do you got on the Kardashians?  What do you got on the sisters?  None of those sisters date anything, you know, whiter than Reggie Bush, man.  That is because the father.  They've all got Jumbo Fever.  The father.  Robert Kardashian.  The lawyer.  Got OJ off the hook.  And it's, you know, it's what it is.  That's it.  I mean, maybe a couple of them had, you know, fixation for OJ Simpson back in the day. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, maybe.  Let's get back to Tiger here because this is it.  This is the only fucking time I'm talking about Tiger Woods.  Tiger fuck Liza?  Hey, I don't know about that.  Probably.  But Tiger's fucked everyone.  Hold on.  I got to get my HD flip back out.  You should just leave it on.  For this massive exclusive.  I'm running out of time and battery.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Oh, man.  Those flip.  Flip.  I hope they're paying you to do this.  I want all this on tape.  Are they sponsoring your flip?  There's a load of tape.  Here we go.  Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods, sum it up for the HD flip so we can make it nice and easy and I can load  it up. 
[02:50:00]  Wait.  You know what?  I can load it immediately.  So hold on.  All right.  Let's load it up.  Give me one take.  Let's make believe we didn't do this.  Yeah, no problem.  And then I can load it immediately and then.  Any Canadians listening to the show today, call in right now.  Say hi.  Someone.  I'm going to point.  And if Jill Nicolini is listening, call in because I have a story about Nicolini that  will blow your guys mind.  Uh-oh.  I had a threesome with her, man.  Up in Montreal.  I know.  I remember you said that.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding, man.  She was going at it with my ex like there was no tomorrow.  All right.  She loves chicks. 
[02:50:30]  Well, I'm running out of battery power.  How about that?  And she looks crack.  Ready?  When you hear that flip go on, you know, I want, what, 90 seconds?  All right.  Here it is.  All right, everyone.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony show and I'm here today for a reason.  All of the tabloids around the world from Germany to Italy to France, they've been after  me for about four weeks asking me to give them the info on Tiger Woods.  The reason why I'm here today is because these guys have the decency not to call me and they've 
[02:51:00]  been good to me over the past year.  They've had me on a couple of times.  So here's the deal on Tiger Woods.  In the sex tape that I heard from a top model, I heard her call Tiger repeatedly Lazy Dog.  That was his nickname throughout the whole tape.  I heard them talking all kinds of kinky shit like they were going to fuck each other's  brains out and then they started doing that on the tape and she was giving him head at 
[02:51:30]  one point and also he kept demanding for snow job and my research shows that snow job is  one of the top positions.  It makes the Kama Sutra look like kindergarten and it's very apparently it's your legs over  your head and all kinds of shit like that.  Look, bottom line here is Tiger Woods has been doing this not recently.  It dates back to at least two years and from what I hear now, he's had a chick in every  town.  He's like the train conductor. 
[02:52:00]  Every town he went to, he was banging someone else.  There was definitely drugs and alcohol in the room based on the tape I heard and apparently  she videoed it.  She's shopping it right now.  I missed the boat.  I admit it.  Look, I always have three or four projects in the pipeline.  Maybe one of them will come to fruition.  This particular project I discussed with a couple of projects, a couple of publishers  I discussed it with.  We didn't think it had legs.  So call me a fool, trash me, whatever you want. 
[02:52:30]  I admit it.  I missed the story.  And this is exclusive to Opie and Anthony's show in New York City.  What's the date today?  Today's the 15th.  January 15th, 2010.  I don't want any media to keep hounding my agent.  I will not talk to them about Tiger Woods anymore after today.  These guys can ask me any question they have about the tape because there are more details.  And that's it.  This is exclusive to Opie and Anthony, New York City, January 15th, 2010. 
[02:53:00]  And to finalize, you have no doubt it's Tiger Woods in this tape having sex and possibly  doing drugs.  Opie, 100%, man.  That was Tiger Woods.  Look, they talk about drugs in the tape.  I don't see him doing drugs.  So I can't say 100% the guy was sniffing or puffing.  But there were definitely drugs in the room.  And they were definitely getting it on in the room together.  And it was pretty explicit.  And he did allude to his wife.  He said their marriage was toasty.  Apparently, the sex he was having with her was terrible. 
[02:53:30]  A lot of times, they'd sleep in separate rooms.  He says at one point, he suspected she might have another guy on the side.  And he couldn't give a fuck.  So he said he didn't care that she might have another guy on the side?  He didn't care.  He said it was over.  He said it was over.  He calls her something like a Swedish bitch at one point.  You know, look, the guy's a dog, man.  You know, bought two kids.  Who would cheat on a wife like that?  Would you bang that chick?  I would, but I would also cheat on her because I'm garbage.  I can't lie.  What about Anthony here? 
[02:54:00]  It doesn't matter how hot a girl is.  Your choice, man.  Jill Nicolini or Tiger Woods' wife.  Who do you take?  Look, I'm trying to apologize to Jill these days.  Yeah, that's a thing that might happen.  Well, yeah, I'm thinking a little fucking, you know.  You miss her in the sack?  No, no, no.  She's hot in the sack, man.  I was feeling a little guilty.  We share something in common here.  We share something in common here.  Oh, let's smell each other's cocks.  I'll smell them both and do the comparison.  I'm not gay.  You know, seriously, man.  Isn't Jill hot?  Uh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:54:30]  I never had a problem with Jill.  Have you ever licked her toe?  She has hot feet.  Seriously.  Wow, really?  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  She's well-groomed, that chick.  Shaves her pussy, the whole deal.  Has to be.  Would you marry her?  I don't marry girls.  You don't marry them?  No.  You just fucking...  I married one.  When was the last time you got laid, dude?  Seriously.  Jesus, he does good.  Anthony fucking is nothing but...  He's a load machine.  Who in this room didn't get laid last night?  Jeez, we're all doing well for media personalities. 
[02:55:00]  We gotta get to Jonathan.  Ian, you wanna stick around?  And do radio with us?  By the way, I fucking...  Because Ian was giving us some great stuff.  We should have had...  And Opie said on the air that he didn't have much battery life.  And so I'm like, why is nobody coming in here with a camera?  Right.  Why is a producer...  Because we all know Ian's full of shit.  There's no tape for the camera.  How do we not have tape for the camera here?  Well, I got enough.  I got that big three-minute piece you just did.  I like that.  Oh, it's exclusive.  You got that on camera, man? 
[02:55:30]  That's it.  It's for you guys.  I don't want anyone to contact me.  Look, again, Lazy Dog.  That's Tiger's nickname in the video.  Lazy Dog.  That'll come out, I guess.  Yeah.  You know, he doesn't seem too lazy to me, man.  He seems to be doing well.  Yeah, he's doing very well.  Well, if he's banging all these broads and they've said, you know, I guess that he's all right.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Take a break.  We got Branstein here to talk about his travels in Haiti. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  For real?  And sad situation.  Yeah.  It really is.  Definitely.  Not in Haiti, but have you been to Haiti or no?  No.  I'm surprised.  I was going to go.  Microphone.  Oh.  Is that on?  I was going to go, but I didn't...  I truly was looking into going right...  Probably February, but...  This is the best time to go.  It is.  You're going to get a lot of deals.  Well, there's some incredible airline deals to Haiti right now.  I actually checked the minute after I heard about it.  The American Airlines had a deal for first class from L.A. to Port-au-Prince for $1,400. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  I thought I'll just buy it just to come to New York.  Yeah, right?  That's pretty cheap.  But that's the penalty.  They don't let you off the plane?  Yeah.  Next stop, Port-au-Prince.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, I haven't been there yet, though, but it's a pretty sad situation.  Who's the president of Haiti?  It's Jean PrÃ©val.  Right.  RenÃ© PrÃ©val.  That's the thing.  RenÃ©, that's right.  The guy who was the president before, Aristide, to give you an idea of how bad it is, he left 
[02:57:00]  and the country that he went to after Haiti was Congo.  Think about that.  To go, if you're going to get exiled from a country and the country they send you to  is the Congo.  That's pretty bad.  That's pretty bad, yeah.  Why is it, well, I think we should take a break and come back.  Yeah, because I really want to get into it with Jonathan.  Jonathan, because Jimmy has told some legendary stories about you, Jonathan, and we want to  get into what's going on in the front of your pants, all sorts of stuff.  Yeah, a lot of stuff to talk about. 
[02:57:30]  A lot of stuff, Ian.  Trust me, you're going to want to be around for this one.  Yes.  We're going to now give you an exclusive, my friend.  That's what we do today.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, Jonathan, and Ian Halpert.  Oh, can I announce something real quick?  I forgot.  Yeah.  In 20 minutes, my tickets for D.C. and where else are going on sale?  D.C. and fucking Chicago.  So, Falls Church, Virginia, and Chicago, in 20 minutes, both go on sale.  March 6, D.C. and then March 12 and 13, Chicago.  All right.  He was just a nasty man. 
[02:58:00]  I wonder where he's at.  All right, Opie and Anthony, we're hanging with Ian Halpert.  Gave us a huge exclusive on Tiger Woods and that sex take.  Yes.  Uploading the video now to my YouTube channel, Opie Radio. 
[02:58:30]  I don't know.  Good.  Hopefully, it'll be up there before we leave for Atlantic City to see little Jimmy Norton this weekend.  And Jonathan's in the corner, Jim Norton's manager.  We all know Jonathan.  Hello.  We love this fucking guy.  He's completely insane.  How many weeks vacation do you get a year from?  I mean, you're your own boss, basically, right?  It's funny because I don't take that many weeks off.  It's just...  But every time you have a week, you really take advantage of that week and do something pretty crazy.  Pretty crazy.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  For example, last year, I went to Cambodia for three days for a weekend.  That was long.  Any longer than three days and it just seems like you're there forever.  You know, it does, actually.  It's that 19-hour flight to Bangkok.  What did you like about Cambodia?  Cambodia was nice.  The jungle was interesting.  I met some guys from the Khmer Rouge.  That was pretty cool.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, I slept in the jungle.  That was neat.  This is the guy I rely on for career advice. 
[02:59:30]  I met some guys from the Khmer Rouge.  You must get all the shots.  Yeah, I have everything now.  Pretty much everything.  There's not a shot you don't have?  No, I've got everything.  In fact, I'm planning to go to the Ivory Coast in probably a month.  So, yeah, I had to just get some kind of another hepatitis tea or whatever.  Yeah, some kind of, man, I bet that's far down.  It's like, I've got A, B, C, and D now.  Yeah, S was the last one, yeah.  It's the type of hepatitis you can only get if a monkey shifts directly into your mouth. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  And you were just showing Anthony and I pictures of you in Afghanistan.  Yeah, in Kabul, which is an interesting place.  Anthony would like it because it's the gun capital of the world, I think.  The pictures you were showing me were fantastic.  Like, everybody is just toting around AK-47s.  Yeah, yeah.  If you want to see guns, and I mean a lot of guns, go there.  A lot of guns, yeah.  But he went actually recently, and just as a citizen, you didn't go in the military. 
[03:00:30]  I didn't go in the military.  I've had clients go who, you know, like Jim's gone before.  The USO events and things like that.  But in that case, I think it's more like you go in a bubble, you know, because you go with the US military.  You fly into the base.  No, I flew from Dubai to Kabul on Safi Airways.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's the only one I fly.  Yeah, yeah, Safi Airways.  It's nothing like it. 
[03:01:00]  You leave at 3.30 in the morning, which is pretty amazing.  Pretty scary, too, I would imagine.  Yeah, seeing the people check in is like, it's a combination of commandos, mercenaries, and the watch list.  You know, I mean, and there's like no women on the flight.  You know, one or two, and that's it.  And usually they're like an aid worker or something.  But mostly it's guys in, you know, cargo pants and, you know, real tight shirts or guys with, you know, that look like they're... 
[03:01:30]  Well, was it a nice new DC-10?  No, it wasn't.  It was a...  707?  No, it was a Tupolev.  You know what that is?  No, no, no, no.  It actually wasn't the Tupolev.  That's the Russian plane.  That's Cami Airways.  That's the other airline.  That's the one they said, you probably don't want to fly Cami.  You know, it's bad if you have old Aeroflot planes.  Yes, yes.  Like those, you know, I might not want to be on this thing.  When you land in Kabul, the first thing you see are a line of broken Soviet helicopters all there on the tarmac. 
[03:02:00]  You know, they're sort of like relics.  From the good old days.  Yeah, from the good old days.  I just sat next to a soldier going from Chicago to New York, and he just talked my ears off.  He said this war is really called Desert Booty.  Now you know how it feels.  Desert Booty.  He said everyone...  It's all about cash there, and all about getting laid.  He said everyone's fucking each other's brains out.  You say there was only men on your plane, but I think if you go deeper right in there, he said all that there is to do there is to fuck. 
[03:02:30]  Really?  In Afghanistan?  Yeah.  He said everyone's fucking each other.  He said because you have the French soldiers.  You mean guys are...  Yeah.  He said...  That's possible.  He said all the...  You know...  No, no.  There's a lot of chicks there, man.  Are there?  Hot chicks from France who are soldiers from all over the place.  He said everyone's fucking each other's brains out.  They're barely even concentrating on combat.  There are...  Okay.  He's not incorrect.  There are a lot of hot girls there, actually.  They're journalists. 
[03:03:00]  They work for NGOs.  There's guys who...  I mean, women who work for embassies and whatnot, but it's a pretty small amount of people.  I mean, if you're in the military, I don't know how you're coming in contact with those  people because you're not really allowed off the base.  I have a friend who's in the U.S. military who was probably about 40 minutes from where  I was.  I called him on the phone.  I wanted to see him.  For him to leave the base was incredibly difficult.  He said, you could come here, but it'll take a while to get the permission. 
[03:03:30]  And it was a nightmare.  I don't know how those guys get off the base and...  A lot of it's on the base because you have all these international delegations there.  Maybe on the one base, on what they call the ISAF.  That's the International Security Assistance Force.  That's the NATO base.  Dude, he told me this is called Desert Booty.  He said he's never got so much pussy in his whole life.  Maybe.  He keeps going back and back.  He said the only reason why he goes back, can't get laid in his own country over there.  He's cleaning up.  Tell him about your two-hour ride into the country.  He just took a two-hour ride deep into Afghanistan. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I went to the Panjshir Valley, which is where...  I might get a little esoteric here for you, but it's where Ahmed Shah Massoud is born,  who's the national hero of Afghanistan.  He's the guy that led the Northern Alliance.  He was killed September 9th, 2001.  He was killed by the guys who posed as journalists.  They were really Al-Qaeda guys.  I went there...  Oh, the trick camera?  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  The old trick camera.  The old trick camera.  The old carnation that you squeeze the little ball, and the bullet goes off. 
[03:04:30]  He was born in this place called the Panjshir Valley, and it's funny because when you had  the little kid on who's on the terrorist watch list, and he kept saying, I'm not a tourist,  terrorist, whatever.  I had a situation where I met the governor of the Panjshir province.  We got to go have tea with him, and I find out really basically he's a warlord, because  I asked the driver, I said, how long, when was he elected?  And he said, oh, a while ago.  I said, well, when does his term end? 
[03:05:00]  He goes, when he wanted to end.  I said, oh, okay, I see.  So you realize he's kind of a warlord.  And we were sitting there with him, and we were talking, and he kept saying, I'm proud  that...  The translator was saying, I'm very proud that there's no tourists in the Panjshir.  There will never be tourists in the Panjshir.  I said, really, you're really proud of the fact there's no tourists here?  And then he looked at me, because the guy translated it back, and then he looked at the guy, and 
[03:05:30]  I thought, oh, he's going to kill the interpreter now.  Yeah, there he goes.  So I leave, because I realized it suddenly hit me.  He meant terrorist.  Oh, shit.  So, yeah.  But it was an amazing thing.  So you were in a place no one goes.  No one.  I wouldn't say...  Well, I mean, most Americans don't go.  Most Americans, no.  Especially Jewish Americans.  Yeah.  And it took two hours.  I want to slow down the story a little bit.  It took two hours to get there.  Yeah.  Were you scared out of your fucking mind?  No.  Tell them how you got a car. 
[03:06:00]  Okay.  We were really lucky.  Someone had arranged for us to go there.  Sounds like luck.  It was actually someone in the Afghan government arranged for us to go there.  So they sent us this ridiculous armored car, which the funny thing is, when you're  in Kabul, what you want to do is be low-key.  So, you know, it's usually the cars that have all the crazy escorts and the guys with  the guns in the back and all that.  To me, that's the stupid thing to do.  So, you know, but so here, and when we were in Kabul, we were always in low-key kind of 
[03:06:30]  cars.  Our bodyguards weren't carrying AK-47s.  They were carrying, you know, handguns.  But the guys who picked us up to take us to the Panjshir, okay, they show up in this  ridiculous Toyota 4Runner that is, it's like the window is three inches thick.  There's no back window.  It's just a porthole.  You know, the thing is blacked out.  I thought, oh, okay, this is cool.  And as we pulled out of the hotel, a car comes in front of us, and another car comes  behind us, and I hear a siren, and I realize, oh, no, there's about five military guys in 
[03:07:00]  a Toyota flatbed truck.  Toyota never thought those trucks would be used for this, I think, with the machine gun  mount in the back, you know, sort of Taliban style.  But we had an armed escort in front of us and in back of us, and we were like this for  two hours.  And the funny thing was, is we kept driving through the countryside to get there.  People kept saluting, because I think they thought someone, you know, was important  in the car.  Someone important as just me.  Yeah.  I'm like, I feel like Zelig, you know, I'm sort of like, look at me, this is just one 
[03:07:30]  of those things, but it's a two-hour drive.  You go through some, the funny thing was, when you get to the Panjshir, it looks like Aspen.  I'm not kidding.  It's a beautiful place, beautiful valley streams.  There's no houses or anything.  So it's sort of like Aspen, maybe 50 years ago.  What you do see, the only thing you see is kind of like a museum, a war museum, because  there's tanks, burned out tanks everywhere from the Soviet days.  Because what the Mujahideen, what they did was they would shoot the tanks from above in 
[03:08:00]  these positions in the mountains.  So that's the only thing you really see, are these burned out tanks.  They've been stripped clean of everything they can possibly be stripped of.  There's nothing left of them, just the shell.  But yeah, I wasn't that scared in the Panjshir, actually.  It was more scary going into the hotel in Kabul, because, and actually the week after I was  there, they rocketed the hotel.  So yeah, that was, but it takes 25 minutes to get into the hotel. 
[03:08:30]  That's the thing.  It has a 25-foot high steel wall, and you pass through three checkpoints in the street.  Then when you get up to the main gate, the guy comes to the car and asks you crazy questions  like, you know, where are you from?  What college did you attend?  Things that, you know, I guess they're trying to throw sort of terrorists off.  So we answer the questions, and then this steel gate opens.  It slides open, and you drive in, and then there's another gate in front of you.  So now that gate behind you closes, so you're sort of trapped. 
[03:09:00]  It's like an airlock, yeah.  Then you have to get out of the car, and two guys come with mirrors.  They come with this, it's like a wand that has all these lights on it.  They're waving it all over the car.  I'm assuming it looks for some kind of bomb.  You go in a separate room where they check you out.  You know, they search you down.  They search all your luggage.  There's an airport screening kind of thing.  So that took about, every time you went in and out of the hotel, 20, 25 minutes.  What a pain in the ass.  Wow, well, I guess, you know.  Why do you have a death wish? 
[03:09:30]  No, I don't have a death wish.  The hotel you were in a week later was bombed.  That's a death wish.  Did you have a problem on the way when you were driving in the fucking, when you guys got into a fender bender?  Yeah, we did, actually.  I didn't want to get into a fender bender there.  On the way.  Do you have insurance?  Well, actually, the funny thing was, we were driving into the Panjshir, and it gets mountainous at one point.  And we're on this road, and this car slid into us, and it wasn't that big of a deal.  It was sort of like, you could hear his wheels spinning out, and then he just kind of bumped into us, basically, from the side. 
[03:10:00]  And I went, whoa.  And then everybody, the guy goes, stay in the car, stay in the car.  And the guy in the front seat got out.  Just opened fire on the guy.  Well, that was the thing.  I thought, oh, boy.  And then all the soldiers start running out.  All the guys, you know, the bodyguards start running out with the guns.  I'm going, oh, man, this is not good.  And it all happened so fast, and I'm thinking, you know, this guy, it was an accident.  I mean, it didn't even occur to me.  And then the person sitting next to me said, it could be the first diversion to throw them off. 
[03:10:30]  And I went, oh, yeah.  Like, yeah, maybe that is.  And then you get real scared.  And then, of course, they all got out, and about 20, 25 minutes passed.  They make sure the guy was okay.  And they let the guy go.  And, I mean, that was probably the scariest moment on that ride out.  You just, you don't think about, you know, Daniel Pearl and things like that and getting your head cut off.  Are you married?  Are you married? 
[03:11:00]  I'm married, yeah.  What does your wife think of this?  Well, this was, the funny thing was, this was two weeks before our wedding.  Oh, man, you really love this chick a lot.  Let me ask you, did you notice any synagogues out there?  There's one.  Really?  There really is one.  You went on Shabbat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, there's one.  And the funny thing was, there's one Jew in Kabul.  There used to be two.  The funny thing about these two guys, they hated each other.  I figured.  Most Jews are the biggest anti-Semites.  In fact, we went and we met the guy, and he said... 
[03:11:30]  Way to be low-key, an armored vehicle, and meet the one Jew in Kabul.  Way to keep it under your hat.  The guy we met, you know, the Jewish guy, he lives in the synagogue there.  And when we brought up the fact, hey, what about the other guy?  You know, he goes, oh, him.  Ugh.  Why do you have to bring him up?  Literally.  I mean, they're in the place with the Taliban, the whole thing.  The only two guys from the same clan, they hate each other. 
[03:12:00]  How come they're not killed?  You know, I don't know.  I don't think...  The Taliban harassed them big time when they were in power, but they didn't kill them.  And I think...  I don't think they're killed because I don't think people care that much.  I mean, for what it's worth, you know, there's 28 million people in Afghanistan.  There's something like 20,000, 25,000 Taliban.  That's it.  I mean...  Yeah.  I mean...  All the rest are upstanding citizens.  I think the Jews should take over. 
[03:12:30]  The two Jews should start.  Let's do an uprising, and let's make this a holy shrine.  No, there's only one now.  That's a thing.  There's only one.  Yeah.  Did you marry a Jew, by the way?  No.  Good boy.  Seriously.  What about Castro?  I want to hear the Castro story again from you.  The Castro story?  Is it...  Well, I don't want to give away the punchline, but...  You went...  You met Fidel.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I met him in...  I met him twice, actually.  The first time was during the film festival in Cuba.  Yeah, because that's normal.  Go to Cuba for a film festival.  And then... 
[03:13:00]  He just says it casually, like, yeah, you've gone, right?  Yeah.  The second time, I went down with a bunch of, you know, big Hollywood executives, and we  met...  We had lunch with him.  We had this six-hour lunch with Fidel.  And, uh...  It was amazing.  I mean, uh...  He...  What were we talking about Cuba earlier, I think?  Or, uh...  I can't remember what it was.  Anyway.  But, um...  Yeah, it was an incredible...  Uh...  He, uh...  He was a fan of the Sopranos, we found out. 
[03:13:30]  Uh...  Who wasn't, you know?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Uh...  He asked if we knew the actor Gerard Depardieu.  And he thought he was very funny.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  There's nothing like sitting around a table full of the most powerful people in Hollywood  and they're asked a question like that.  Do you know the actor Gerard Depardieu?  He's very funny.  And everyone went, uh...  Wow.  Uh...  Uh...  All right.  Yeah, sure.  Yes, Presidente.  Yes, Comandante.  Very funny.  I broke a big Castro story last year in the New York Post. 
[03:14:00]  I did a documentary on Cuba.  Barbara Walters, that's what it was.  And you could Google this.  I said, have you ever heard how many chicks Castro slept with?  Oh, it's a lot, I'm guessing.  35,000.  35...  Google it.  It's all over.  You Google me and Castro, you'll see it.  35,000 chicks.  Well, wait.  I remembered what I was going to say now earlier, which was, you were talking about Barbara Walters.  Yeah.  There's a rumor about her and, uh...  And Fidel?  Yeah, Fidel.  It wouldn't surprise me.  Yeah.  He likes to...  He loved her.  Muammar Gaddafi, too, man.  That guy, whenever a foreign journalist would come in, he'd bring her into the tent, entertain her, 
[03:14:30]  you know, slip something in her drink, and then she'd wake up, you know...  Barbara Walters and Oriana Falaci.  The only two, uh...  That's right.  Oh, who's your fucking pen pal?  This is who he writes to.  Oh, uh, General Noriega.  They write each other.  He fucking writes to Noriega, and he writes back.  Let me tell you how it started.  I wanted to give a friend of mine a gift.  I wanted to get a...  Jesus.  So Ian, Noriega likes getting that pussy? 
[03:15:00]  Oh, I don't know about Noriega, man.  I'm like, jeez.  I wanted to get a gift.  Are you Facebook friends with him, too?  No, no.  I wanted to get a gift for a friend of mine who's a, you know, very wealthy guy who's  got everything, a lot of things.  I said, what can I get in that special?  And we'd been talking about Panama.  We'd been talking about Noriega.  And I said, you know, what's happening with the guy?  So I realized he's still in jail.  And this is something that a lot of people don't realize.  He's still in jail, and I don't know why, because he served his sentence.  The sentence is over.  He was sentenced to, I think it was 20 years. 
[03:15:30]  He did the full 20, and he's still there.  He did the full 20.  But the interesting thing was this.  So I said, well, I'm going to take a chance.  So I bought his book, and I wrote him a letter.  I sent him the book, and I thought, we'll see what happens.  Sure enough, he sent me the book back.  He signed it.  You know, he wrote in it, those who do not learn the past.  Condemned to repeat it.  Condemned to repeat it, yeah.  And General Manuel Antonio Noriega.  What I found out was this. 
[03:16:00]  He's in Florida.  He's in Miami still.  He wears his uniform, I think, every day, because he's technically a prisoner of war.  So he's allowed to.  He gets all the things, you know, that are accorded to people under the Geneva Convention.  You know, war prisoners or whatever.  He has to be called General Noriega, still.  Wow.  Which must piss off the, you know, prison guards, I'm guessing.  Yeah.  General, you're ready for your meal.  Yeah, but he, and so then anyway, I thought, well, this is so nice. 
[03:16:30]  And I felt bad because he had to pay for the postage for the book.  So I didn't know if he worked in the commissary or what.  But so, so I sent him back a note with, well, I sent him back a note saying, hey, listen,  do I owe you money for the postage?  Thank you.  You know, he wrote me back.  No, don't worry about it.  All is okay.  So then I said, this is nice.  So then I read this great book called Panama Fever by Matthew Parker.  And I said, oh, I'm going to send it to him, see what he thinks.  So I sent him the book. 
[03:17:00]  Then he wrote me this long note back about, you know, see, Theodore Roosevelt who took Panama,  blah, blah, blah.  This crazy rambling note.  And then it started that way.  That was how the pen pal started.  So we kind of write each other back and forth.  And I went to Panama last July.  And it's interesting.  They, it's a tough question.  They don't like Noriega there.  But then people will tell you, but things ran a little better.  Like Iraq, man. 
[03:17:30]  Love him or hate him.  It ran with Saddam Hussein.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You mean Iraq with Saddam Hussein.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pete texted me.  Uh-oh.  Have him tell the story about the guy he helped out of Cuba with.  Oh, that story is, oh, let's hear it.  Come on.  Is Pete, is Pete sent you up for not a good story?  Uh, yeah, no.  It's just so boring.  No, you're worried you're going to get busted here.  No, no, no.  You're doing something illegal.  No, let's hear it.  No, I didn't do anything illegal.  Did he get cigars?  No, we, we, it's a long story.  You got cigars from Fidel Castro. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you want to, okay.  All right.  I'm not sure if we told this one on the internet.  I don't know.  All right.  And so we all went and we got, at the end of the lunch, we're sitting there and I see  them roll out this, this tray and I'm looking and I'm going, whoa, look at all the cigars.  There's boxes of cigars and the kind of cigars that he's only allowed to give out.  They're made specifically for him.  So if you think about people who know Cuban cigars, these are the best of the best, you  know?  And, uh, they bring out this box and they roll it in and I'm like, oh man, I can't believe  it.  Sure enough, he gives us this box. 
[03:18:30]  He gives us each a box of cigars.  I'm like, this is incredible.  I think quick on my feet.  I put him right in front of him with a pen.  He signs the box.  Okay.  So now I've got a signed box of amazing Cuban cigars from people.  I come back and, um, uh, David, who I work with, who Jim knows, um, has this big humidor  in his office.  And, uh, I, I, I'm like, well, I'm going to store them in here.  So I put them in there.  And at the time David was, was, was traveling quite a bit and his assistant Tanner was sending 
[03:19:00]  him cigars everywhere he was going.  And she would just take the cigars out of the box, put them in a plastic thing and FedEx  them to wherever he was going.  You know, cause he would smoke them like crazy.  So one day I go in there to look and I go, oh no, where's my cigars?  She, she, she actually, yeah, without looking at the box, even though I'd put a note on  them, uh, saying, do not touch, you know, do not, you know, big letters where she didn't  pay attention.  She took the cigars, she threw them in the envelope, send them to him.  He smoked them all.  And she threw the box away. 
[03:19:30]  That, that is a horror story.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you upset?  Yeah.  I was going to say.  I, I, she left the office that day.  She was so scared.  Did you cry?  I didn't cry.  I think I would almost cry.  I almost did.  Yeah.  It doesn't get better than.  You can't get those again.  Right.  You can't get.  Yeah.  Where are you getting that again?  Cigars from Fidel Castro with a signed fucking cigar box.  Just, just purely a.  What do you think something like that is worth?  My signed Babe Ruth rookie card.  A signed box just like that sold at an auction last year for, or no, four years ago for $25,000. 
[03:20:00]  That was four years ago.  Four years ago now.  I can't imagine what they'd be now.  And if, if he dies in the next year or whatever.  He's way up, right?  Think about it.  Yeah.  In the garbage.  In the garbage.  I said, did you save the box?  No, I threw it away.  Ah!  You know, it was just, uh.  Oh, God.  And it wasn't that day, obviously.  It wasn't recently, or it had been weeks before something she had done it?  Yeah.  That was the thing.  It wasn't like I could run to the garbage, you know, by then.  It was way too late.  Yeah.  It was way too late. 
[03:20:30]  That box is somewhere now.  Did you like Cuba?  I loved it, yeah.  The music's amazing, right?  The music's incredible.  The best trumpet player in the world.  And the pussy.  And the pussy.  I forget about the pussy in Cuba.  This guy probably went to the airport in the wheelchair, right?  Because those chicks are hot.  A lot of pussy down there.  A lot of beautiful women in Cuba.  Yeah.  A lot of beautiful women.  The world's best trumpet player, Arturo Sandoval, Dizzy Gillespie discovered him.  He's from Cuba, man.  Thank you, yeah.  He's amazing.  But when was the last time you were there?  Oh, God.  It was a while ago.  Did you fuck a Cuban broad?  Seriously, tell us. 
[03:21:00]  No, I ain't.  No, don't hum and hum.  Did you get laid?  Bottom line.  I had fun in Cuba.  There you go.  I had fun in Cuba.  Cuba is an amazing country.  Did you wear an umbrella?  Or is there some Cuban kids you have there?  I don't think I have any children in Cuba.  And you're a negligent dad.  I'm a negligent dad.  Fucking individual.  Hey, Jonathan.  Yeah.  You also told Jimmy and I about how when you go to some of these places, I forgot which one you were talking about.  You get on some of these planes where they make stops and people get off.  Oh, yeah.  And they bring livestock on the plane, if I'm not mistaken. 
[03:21:30]  I was in West Africa.  West Africa.  In the Sahara.  And I flew from Timbuktu to Bamako, Mali.  And the thing about it was when I got on the plane, the first thing that you notice when you go through the airport, I had a, literally, you'll appreciate this, Anthony, I had a bag of knives that I bought from these cool Twirid guys that I met.  And so I said, okay, I go through the security thing and I, they didn't have a conveyor belt to put your luggage on. 
[03:22:00]  It just had the thing you walk through.  And the guy just marched, motioned to me.  He said, yeah, just put the bag down.  And I put the bag down.  I walked through it.  He wands me.  And he says, okay, you're fine.  I said, what about the bag?  And then he grabs the bag from the other side so it doesn't go through the metal detector and hands it to me.  I'm like, great.  In on it.  But now I'm on the, I'm about to get on the plane.  And as you're about to get on the plane, these guys come running up to you to sell you all sorts of stuff.  And the, the best thing that I found that you can buy on the runway in, in Timbuktu is about a, is a 10 inch dagger that I bought. 
[03:22:30]  Okay.  This is after the security.  Yeah.  This is like the gift shop, the 10 inch dagger that I bought right before I got on the airplane.  So I get on the airplane and then this, this woman makes a loud noise.  I hear some yelling at the front and I'm on a, I think it was like a dash eight or something, you know, the kind, uh,  it's a propeller, you know, and, uh, I hear this commotion at the front and a woman has a cage with chickens in it and she's bringing it on and she wants to put it in the, 
[03:23:00]  there's barely any room above you, but she wants to put it above her.  And, um, she's screaming and yelling cause she doesn't want the chickens to go under the plane.  And, uh, finally they, they let her on.  And then, and then comes a guy with a baby goat.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, we got on and I, so we're in the air and now I'm thinking, all right, well, uh, the flight should, it's like an hour, I guess.  And 10 minutes later, the guy's like, okay, we'll be landing soon.  I'm like, what do you mean landing soon?  What I found out was this is like a bus.  It stops in six places before you get, yeah. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  So they say takeoff and landing is the most dangerous part.  So I'm thinking six times, you know, it's the only time I took a Xanax.  Uh, because I, I literally like, I'm okay with flying.  This freaked me out.  Like, okay, six landings and takeoff.  Yeah.  What are the odds you're going to make all of them?  You know, and, and, and the first one we land at, you realize that's dirt.  There's no runway.  It's dirt.  And, and, uh, and I'm thinking the security at the airport in Timbuktu was bad. 
[03:24:00]  What's it like in Mopti?  Okay.  You know, or Gen A where you're landing.  Yeah, nothing.  I mean, it, you know, it's a guy with a, like a dashiki on and, and, and he's got  a flashlight, you know, that's, you know, so he's like this with the plane and, you  know, like waving it in thinking, oh, that's the, that's the symbol of authority here.  You're a modern day adventurer.  You're an adventurer.  Those things were gone in like the early 1900s.  This guy wants the diamond.  No, I do.  He wants her to live. 
[03:24:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He's living.  I'll tell you, I went to, uh.  Is your mother still alive?  Yeah.  Man, she, she must be freaking out at home.  Well, when I went to, she, you must've, I don't know, you must've been ignored or something  in college.  No, no, no, no.  No, dude, dude, seriously.  You're mom, you're, what did your parents do to deserve this?  I, they're cool with it for the most part.  The only part they're.  He's living his life.  I have respect for John.  The only part they have a hard time with is it was a place like Afghanistan or whatever.  But, but I'll tell you this, the craziest place, uh, totally on, I mean, this, I've never, 
[03:25:00]  the only time I ever did this was on a total whim, go someplace.  Uh, usually I think about it, where I want to go and, you know, what I want to do.  Do a little research and whatever, right?  On a total whim.  I was in, uh, I went to Moscow.  Okay.  But that wasn't the whim, but we, we had like, uh, I think it was six days and we were  kind of getting, I knew that six days would be kind of too long.  What year?  What year?  Set the stage.  2000.  It might've been 2000.  All right.  And we said, what should we do?  What should we do?  We have, we have, I was with a buddy of mine. 
[03:25:30]  I said, we have like six days, six days is too long in Moscow.  Let's go somewhere in the region.  So we did this thing where you ever play that game when you're a kid where you put your finger  on the map, you close your eyes and you just, we did that.  I went to Yerevan, Armenia.  Okay.  The only country where, when you get there, every person you meet, it doesn't matter who  they are.  The first question, why are you here?  Why are you here?  Every single question was like that.  No one could understand why we went there.  You have family here?  No, no family.  Point it at a map.  Why you come here? 
[03:26:00]  Why you come here?  Why you come to Yerevan?  Everybody there was asking us a question.  It got to the point that I said, let's go.  We left the day early.  We flew back and we left and it was a horrible snowstorm.  This was in February.  And I remember when the guy, when we were landing, because that was the thing, you got  to the airport and all the other airlines were closed.  Aeroflot was still out, still flying.  That's right.  And I said, oh boy, this is not going to be good.  And I was real nervous. 
[03:26:30]  And the guy was talking on his cell phone next to me and miraculously getting reception  for most of the flight.  As we landed, we were about to land, we went down and then, you ever been on a plane when  they abort the landing?  Yeah, yeah.  That's crazy.  It was horrible.  Missed approach.  Up and down.  Yeah, terrifying.  And then the pilot said something like, all right, we're going to try again.  Oh, yeah.  And the word try and land is the same.  We will try this again. 
[03:27:00]  We try again.  Don't you worry.  They speak in English?  Yeah.  Well, they do an announcement first in Russian and then they do it in a, you know.  A few languages.  Miss airport try again.  So you travel a lot.  Aviation language.  Ian, you didn't ask him about the Moscow pussy.  Well, no.  He travels a lot.  What's your monthly bill for hookers?  Seriously.  I don't know.  Monthly bill for hookers?  Yeah.  Come on.  All you guys.  No.  Yeah.  You know, in West Africa, let me tell you, it's great because there's some great bars  where all the truckers go in West Africa who go along the trans-African highway, which 
[03:27:30]  is nice because, I mean, it's safe there, I figured, you know.  It's pretty safe to me.  I love how you just figure this out.  He just figures, Jimmy.  Jonathan doesn't do anything sexual.  He makes scrapbooks when he comes home, but he fucking tapes matches in giant scrapbooks.  I have these.  I keep a journal when I'm there.  And so I tape everything into it.  You know, like if I get a receipt from the airport, you know, I write it in there.  When we went to Vietnam, my girlfriend at the time, she needed some tampons. 
[03:28:00]  Could not find the kind she wanted.  We looked all over the place, and she got so mad at me because the only kind they had  were this awful brand called Helen Harper.  And I remember I cut out the, it's a picture of a woman on it, this, you know, horrible looking  woman.  And I cut out the box so that it was flat, and I taped it in my journal.  She goes, why are you saving that?  I said, because this is a good memento from Vietnam.  It's the time you were on your period and cranky. 
[03:28:30]  Did you fuck her once you had her period?  You like fucking chicks one day?  No, no, no.  No, seriously.  People get it.  I'm fucking wrong.  Stephen has from Bayshore.  Now people are doing Ian Lines.  Armenian stewardesses are known for their 10 labias.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Look it up.  Look it up.  Labias and Ian Halpert on Google.  You'll see that.  Armenian.  Armenian.  What did Jesse Ventura say?  Fucking Ian.  You didn't get into the Moscow pussy.  I'm really surprised by you, Ian.  Moscow's insane.  I was there before the wall fell down and all that, man. 
[03:29:00]  I was taking taxis.  I was there, too, before the wall fell, yeah.  Wasn't that wall?  I was there.  Yeah, it was crazy.  When Leningrad was...  I was there when it was Leningrad, yeah.  Yeah, man.  I used to take taxis there.  I'd give the guy a Beatles tape, a cassette.  You just happen to have them?  I used to bring them because a taxi driver will take you all day for a pair of jeans.  Ask him.  Or a Beatles tape.  Yeah, the black market, things like that.  You could trade things.  I went there in 1986. 
[03:29:30]  It was the first time.  When I came back in, I think it was 2000, the profound differences.  I remember you could trade jeans.  And then in 2000...  It was Andropov then?  Who was the...  No, no, no.  Gorbachev.  I'll tell you.  Gorbachev.  I was there on Gorbachev.  And that was a cum stain on his head, by the way.  Google it.  Google it.  Really?  It was a cum stain on his head.  Really?  Look it up on Google.  I almost got it.  Gorbachev.  People are drinking out there today.  Look it up.  Did you get laid in Moscow in 86?  That's it. 
[03:30:00]  No.  You didn't?  I didn't, no.  Well, you were a Jewish nurse.  They wouldn't touch you?  You're the only Jew that...  I was probably more paranoid then.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm paranoid about diseases.  That was the time of what's-his-name, Sharansky, and all those people making headlines.  It wasn't cool for a Jew to go there, man.  They weren't too kind to the target.  I've never really listened to that, you know.  People want to know if you're a CIA spy.  Everyone asks me.  I've been obsessed with Nolly, if he's fucking, if he's sending weapons.  You got a spy. 
[03:30:30]  A spy.  It's so funny.  CIA.  It's a spy.  That's the problem.  If you travel places in the world, because most people...  Have you ever seen the State Department website when they had the travel warnings?  No.  Why would we?  If you look at them, and you read them, you basically won't go anywhere.  And I just kind of stopped subscribing to that.  So, naturally, when you go travel places, people think, why are you going there?  What's the real reason?  You know, a lot of the times, it's just to check out the music or the people. 
[03:31:00]  You want to check out the world, right?  Yeah.  Have you ever been to South Africa?  No.  You got to go there.  I mean, yeah.  Why, Ian?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  Hot as chicks, nice as chicks.  No, South Africa's nice.  No, really.  You know where I want to go is Mozambique.  That's supposed to be amazing.  You know, Mandela, Mandela, Mary.  You can just fuck, you know, black chicks off the street.  Just grab them.  No, really.  No, really.  South Africa and black chicks are so fucking hot.  I fucked with you.  Yeah, I'm hot.  In the 80s.  You absolutely have AIDS. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  No, look it up.  I don't have AIDS.  Google it.  Google it.  I don't have AIDS.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Six umbrellas.  Yeah.  One shot.  Look.  Are you that guy?  You have more of a shot again in AIDS with all due respect to her from the pussy.  You're, you know, Jill Nicolini, man.  She's been around the block.  I'm trying to apologize here.  There's going to be a Jill update soon, man.  You're fucking at my apologies.  Have you ever licked her toes?  Tell me the truth.  Have you ever licked her toes?  No, no, no.  Ian's a foot guy.  Ian, are you that guy that goes to these places and just, you're that guy? 
[03:32:00]  Not really.  I'm a quiet guy.  Uh-huh.  You know, I have a girlfriend.  I'm faithful.  I have a kid.  I'm not like you, man.  I don't cheat on my wife.  Would you, would you, let's assume for a second you didn't have a girlfriend or whatever.  Would you, would you go to Africa?  You wouldn't think twice about, uh...  I love black women.  Really?  Oh, man.  What do you like about black women?  And I like licking them out.  I know, but there's a real, like, licking them out.  Even when they're on the rag, seriously.  It's so beautiful.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[03:32:30]  It's like art.  Have you, have you, have you, look it up.  African women on the rag.  I know this guy loves women.  Google.  I do love women.  It's like chocolate covered cherries.  Have you ever licked out someone when they're on the rag?  No.  I've done a lot of dirty things.  But I've, I've never, I've never done that.  That's true love.  But I, but, but even, even Jim Norton, I don't think would go to, uh, like West Africa, for  example.  Yeah, yeah.  And mess around with hookers.  What's wrong with hookers?  I don't mess around with hookers.  What's wrong with hookers?  I don't mess around with hookers, man.  The clean girls have AIDS.  Uh, I, I, I, I don't pay, I don't have to pay like you. 
[03:33:00]  I know.  All right, Ian.  I don't have to pay like you.  You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're.  You're using that shit as a tax write-off.  If I don't do it, I go there and I, I deal with the locals, man.  I got a job for you.  It's called rape.  One more thing with Jonathan that we need to know.  Yeah.  We've all wanted to know.  Ian, ask him about, uh, that bulge in the front of his penis.  We have to ask how big Jonathan's penis is.  We're not sure if it's a big ball or if he's packing some heat.  No, do you, do you got the Jewish long man syndrome?  Like, how long is it?  How?  Yeah, but my, my, look, I, I'm playing with mine right now, right off here.  What was the line, uh, Milton Berle used to say? 
[03:33:30]  I'll take out just enough to, just to win.  To win, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think Bramstein's all cock.  You're packing?  I think he is.  What do you got?  I do okay.  What do you got going on, Jonathan?  Or is it just that you wear tight pants?  We can't figure out.  No pants that tight, naked dick.  It's got to be in the show, man.  What do you say to you?  A lot of Jewish men are well hung.  You're one of them.  Admit it.  I, I do okay.  I'm all right.  I'm, see, you're getting it.  Have you ever dated, have you ever fucked one of your clients?  A lot of these Hollywood-  Simply by managing them, yes. 
[03:34:00]  That was like, I saw that softball lob over to Jimmy, man.  I've always wondered why Jimmy's not further along in his career.  Now I know.  He's too busy traveling the fucking world.  Have you ever fucked one of your clients?  Jimmy?  It's too busy.  Line?  Where's the safest place you've been, Jonathan?  Yeah.  The safest place.  In the studio.  In the studio.  In the studio.  In the studio.  Where's the pussy in the safest place?  I don't know.  Safest place.  I'm joking.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  That was just a lie. 
[03:34:30]  Have you ever been shot at?  Oh, that's a good question.  Look at you.  Not talking about pussy.  No, not really.  Although, there was a suicide bomber when I got to Afghanistan, but that was-  How close were you to that?  Three blocks.  From a suicide bomber?  Yeah.  And you don't have a death wish?  It was the first hour we got there.  Walking through the lobby of the hotel, and you hear, boom.  And I'm like, oh boy, what was that?  Someone turned to me and said, that was a bomb.  I said, no, come on.  Because at first you're like, what do you expect in Afghanistan?  20 people killed, 81 wounded. 
[03:35:00]  I mean, it was like, you know-  Wow.  The first hour and a half in the country, so-  Wow.  Yeah.  Jonathan, do you get scared?  Yeah, I was scared going there, and I was scared-  I wasn't scared, surprisingly, when that happened.  I was more scared when the car hit us, when we were driving further in Afghanistan.  Yeah, that does seem like one of those movie moments where they get out and just spray  the vehicles with machine gun fire.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  I'm trying to-  Oh, oh, in West Africa, I got arrested.  Well, I got detained in the train station.  Very casually.  In the train station, I got detained, and I did something really stupid, which was I  had been videotaping the train.  There's a train that goes from-  Well, it starts in Niger, but then it basically goes from Bamako, Mali, to Dakar, Senegal.  Now, imagine the train in Schindler's List, and that looks good.  It looks good compared to this train, okay?  Did they hose down the car? 
[03:36:00]  Let me tell you, this car, there's no lights in them.  It's a three-day journey, okay?  There's nowhere to go to the bathroom.  There's no lights.  I mean, you see little kids jumping on and off the train as it's leaving the station,  and I videoed it.  I thought, this is just amazing.  Look at this.  So I videoed it, and then the next thing I know, this guy comes running out, and I'm  like, whoa, he's yelling at me, screaming at me.  He doesn't care.  I mean, they got little kids jumping under the tracks, literally, as the train's leaving.  He doesn't give a shit about that.  He cares only about that I'm videotaping the train leaving. 
[03:36:30]  So he grabs me, and he makes me go in the office, and two security guards, or police,  whatever they were, these guys come in, and they're yelling at me.  And the stupid thing I did was, he said, finally, the one guy was like, okay, just erase everything  you shot.  And I basically didn't.  What I did was, I rewound it, and I erased maybe three seconds of what I shot, and then  pretended like I had erased the whole thing, because I really didn't want to erase it. 
[03:37:00]  And he believed me.  He bought it.  But I thought, oh, man, I could get arrested here.  Speaking of trains, did you ever pull a train when you were there?  With, like, one chick and a bunch of guys?  Do you cheat on your wife?  No.  I don't cheat on my wife.  No.  Look at me, because I have a good BS detector here.  Look at me right in the...  I've been married...  Look at me right in the...  How long have you been married?  Since November.  Do you cheat on your wife?  No, I don't cheat on my wife.  At least not yet. 
[03:37:30]  Is she hot?  Yeah.  How old is she?  She's 36.  How old are you?  42.  Well, 41.  Sorry, I'll be 42.  And does she bang you every night?  Is she good?  Are you going to just whip it out and jerk it off to the authority?  I started answering the questions.  Why did you marry her, man?  It's got to be sex.  Yeah.  What does she do?  What's her background?  You said she's not part of the tribe.  What is she?  Haitian?  Where did you pick her up? 
[03:38:00]  Haitian.  Haitian?  No, she's...  She's in the South.  What the fuck?  Southern people are nice, but...  She's very nice.  I always say...  I dated a woman from Charlotte.  No, from...  What's that place in South Carolina?  That city there.  Charlotte.  Columbia.  Oh, Charleston.  Beautiful.  She used to live in Charleston.  Charleston.  Charleston.  Let me tell you, she...  There's an expiry date on...  Where's she from?  She used to live in Charleston, but...  See, I told you, all these chicks from Charleston,  they all...  Is she blonde? 
[03:38:30]  Yes.  She's from Arkansas originally.  The exact same thing, man.  They chase rich guys, and there's all...  Man, I hope you have a good lawyer.  I'm telling you, tape this.  I hope you have a good fucking lawyer.  I've been through this drill.  I dated a woman from Charleston who lived in Nassau for years.  In the Bahamas.  In the Bahamas.  Yeah.  Okay, she moved there, and she did really well.  But man, there's an expiry...  They know how to fuck.  I'll tell you that.  But there's an expiry date on these chicks.  I'm telling you, man, you're gonna...  Maybe it was you.  Brother to brother, man.  Really?  They couldn't take it.  It was just you, Ian. 
[03:39:00]  I'm from a family of Holocaust survivors, man.  The Holocaust is like, you know, a picnic.  Damn, why couldn't it be 6,000,001?  Jonathan, or old taffy bag, as I call him.  Yes.  I've never seen him fucking hit on chicks.  Never.  And Jonathan's a very powerful man in Hollywood.  What's wrong with you, Ian?  I thought Jonathan was gay for a while.  Really?  I didn't think you were gay for a person.  Because you were so not into, like...  You weren't a pig with chicks.  And I met his girlfriend and his wife, and...  When's this guy gonna be worldwide?  He's known all over the States. 
[03:39:30]  He's selling out Atlantic...  Good news, isn't it?  That's good.  But you gotta hit it...  He's going to Haiti.  He's gonna do...  Are you serious?  Jim's gonna Haiti, yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  Yes.  That's where his big comedy connections are.  What about the UK?  Because there seems to be a difference in humor there.  Like, guys like Lenny Henry and all those guys.  I don't get it.  I go to those shows in London.  I sit there.  Everyone's laughing but me in the place.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean...  There's a difference, but I think... 
[03:40:00]  I mean, there's people in England that like Jim.  Have you performed in England?  Never.  I always said no.  Why?  Because I think the guys that do very well in England are the guilty Americans who are  like, yeah, Americans are stupid.  And they do that fucking whore humor shit.  And I'm a pompous American and I fucking hate Europe.  Good.  Good for you.  Why can't you get these guys, Opie and Anthony, to replace Conan?  I think they're better.  Like, this guy's a disaster Conan.  Yeah, what do you got in store for us, Joe?  To replace Conan.  Yeah!  Why aren't you hustling? 
[03:40:30]  Why the fuck are you here today wasting time?  Replace Conan?  What do you mean, replace Conan?  It's telling adventurers stories.  Replace Conan?  We gotta like...  Replace Conan or replace...  Dude, I was at Letterman two years ago, I kid you not, Julianne Moore was on before  these guys.  I was in the audience watching these guys.  And they're good on TV.  Did you wait in line?  Yeah, I did.  I absolutely did.  My friend's a fan of these guys from Canada.  Yeah, Jonathan, what do you got in store for us?  Maybe not Conan, but what do you got?  I don't know.  What's your idea for the Opie and Anthony show?  How do we branch out?  I think you guys should do a TV show. 
[03:41:00]  Hell fucking yeah, I think so.  I think so, too.  I think so, man.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm in.  Hey, Ian, your exclusive video is up on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  Hey, thank you.  The Tiger Woods Sex Tape exclusive.  Thank you guys for having me.  You guys rock.  Everyone in Canada.  Supposedly you only gave us the news and no one else, right?  No, I'm not talking to anyone else.  If we find out you gave anyone else the news, you're done.  You have my word.  Just stop calling.  The bigger story was the fact that you wouldn't give anybody the story. 
[03:41:30]  Dude, I'm a busy guy.  They're calling me.  What's in it for you?  It seems to be the story.  What the fuck do I need that for?  You know, I said, to get off my back, my agent told me this week, dude, you've got to speak  to someone.  So I said, okay, I'm going to these guys.  These guys have had me on this year.  They've made my book number one New York Times bestseller.  I said, I'm going to.  They weren't greedy.  They weren't phoning my agent ten times a day.  You know, they're terrible journalists.  I gave it to them.  I love you.  I know people out there hate you, Ian, but I have to say I love you, Ian Albert. 
[03:42:00]  I love you guys, man.  These guys should be in Canada.  We are in Canada.  XM Canada.  All over.  Two people listen to that.  I mean, you guys got to be on TV.  It might be right, actually.  Get these guys a TV show, man.  Come on, Jonathan.  I'm the testimonial.  I saw them on Letterman.  There was a fucking crowd outside.  Julianne Morse.  No, they paid attention.  They were all over these guys.  Remember that?  A friend of mine owns a TV station in Afghanistan. 
[03:42:30]  I'm in.  I'll go there to do something.  How cool is that?  Can't be any worse than XFL game day.  Bring it all back around.  Bring it all back around.  We got to switch chairs now because these guys want me to take a powder.  Look, guys.  I thank you.  You have my.  Take a powder.  We're the fuck out of here.  We're in the shell.  We're in the shell.  Don't make it seem like you're leaving like fucking Bing Crosby leaving Carson.  You got my word.  We're all leaving at the same time.  We're all leaving.  We're all leaving.  We have one thing.  We have one thing in common for life. 
[03:43:00]  Jill Michelin.  I'm trying to, you know, be a stand-up guy.  Has anyone else in here banged you?  Jill Michelin?  We're going to just wrap up.  Jimmy's going to be at the Borgata.  Tonight, tomorrow.  This weekend.  We're all going down there.  I'm driving down.  My car.  My actual car is waiting outside.  I got to drive.  So I got to get the fuck out of here.  Is that okay?  Hey, I'm cool with it.  Anthony will be down there.  Jimmy will be down there.  Jimmy, what else do you promote real fast?  My tickets for D.C.  Or actually, it's Falls Church, Virginia, March 6th.  Tickets are on sale as of 10 a.m. this morning.

You know that guy, Man Cow?  Yeah, this show doesn't get along with Man Cow.  Now, I know Cow.  Wow, you just blew it in.  We'll never see you again.  Oh, really?  The guy's the king of Chicago, man.  Is he?  No.  Well, that's a title of the sausage king of Chicago.  What does he not know? 
[03:44:00]  He's anti-Obama.  No, there was just a lot of strife between the radio shows.  He's just a phony fucking asshole piece of shit.  I live in the woods in Canada.  I don't follow any of this shit.  He is a phony.  You're better than that, Ian.  When you sit here, when we talk and shit, it's like fucking, it's us.  Yeah, we're like, yeah, we're honest.  We're just going to fucking, we're just going to fucking talk.  He's trying to bring down Obama.  I have heard that.  Oh, wow.  A lot of people are in.  Yeah, another guy with a littler show.  What's his name?  Rush Limbaugh?  Yeah, he's trying to do the same thing as show as Man Cow. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, literal, Jim.  Hey, where's Chet?  What's that?  What about Montreal, man?  This guy should, you know, I'm from Montreal.  What would Chip say?  Jesus Christ.  Are you going to get this guy in Montreal?  Horrifically unfunny.  Are you getting him in Montreal to the Just for Laughs?  That's the biggest comedy fest?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the headline, the whole thing.  Can you pull that off this year?  Phone Andy Nolman.  It's a question if he wants to do it.  All right.  Yeah, go to Canada.  What am I going to say to everybody up there?  Hey, guys, you know, maybe I'm taking over or something. 
[03:45:00]  You know, no one knows.  Chip.  Yeah.  Do you have anything to promote, Jonathan?  No.  Jim Norton.  Go see Jim Norton.  Jonathan's balls and dick will be appearing in the Tampa Improv.  What dangerous place are you going to next?  CÃ´te d'Ivoire, the Ivory Coast.  Oh, right.  You said that.  Shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Man, I'm struggling with my balls.  I'll be John, the capital of CÃ´te d'Ivoire.  Does the wife travel at the time at all?  Sometimes, yeah.  Yeah?  How is it on the road with her?  Fine. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, she did well.  We went to Laos together.  That was cool.  Does she shop a lot?  Not too bad, no.  Speaking of a Laos.  Hey, wait.  What's Ian going to be up to?  Anthony, wait.  You will like Afghanistan for another reason.  You could go there and you could fire surface-to-air missiles.  They let you do that.  See, that's something I can't find a place to do here.  You would want to do that, right?  But I can't do that here.  I mean, you would want to do that, I'm guessing.  Yes!  I know.  It's nothing at a vehicle.  Yeah.  Fantastic. 
[03:46:00]  Ian, what are you promoting?  We've got to go for real.  I'm just promoting you guys, everyone.  Opie and Anthony, Sean, Sirius Radio.  They got the Tiger Woods exclusive.  No one call me again.  I guarantee you guys that you were out.  I'm only talking to you guys just today.  And everyone check out Big Jim over here.  He smashed Jesse Venturi.  He's going to kill Atlantic City tonight.  And Chicago, Washington.  And let's get him on the road.  Let's make him into the brand name.  And let's get Opie and Anthony to replace Conan.  Conan's a stiff.  This show rocks.  Love Ian.  Thank you for having me.  See you later.
